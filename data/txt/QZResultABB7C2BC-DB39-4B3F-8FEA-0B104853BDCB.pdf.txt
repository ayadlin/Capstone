BACKGROUND: Mucinous and clear cell histology have been associated with adverse prognosis in ovarian carcinomas. The authors compared the outcome of these subtypes with that of serous tumors in patients who were treated
with combination paclitaxel/platinum at their center. METHODS: Four hundred twenty patients with histologically
confirmed, serous (n ¼ 367), mucinous (n ¼ 24), or clear cell (n ¼ 29) ovarian carcinomas, International Federation of
Gynecology and Obstetrics stage III or IV disease, and who were treated with paclitaxel/platinum after cytoreductive
surgery were included in this analysis. RESULTS: The median overall survival for each histological subtype was 47.7
months (95% confidence interval [CI], 37.7-57.7 months) for serous, 15.4 months (95% CI, 4.2-26.6 months) for mucinous, and 36.6 months (95% CI, 22.7-50.5 months) for clear cell carcinomas. Cox regression analysis showed that
mucinous histology was an independent predictor of poor prognosis compared with serous tumors (hazard ratio,
0.360; 95% CI, 0.215-0.603; P ¼ .001). In contrast, such a difference between clear cell and serous carcinomas was
not found (P ¼ .337). Median survival of patients with mucinous tumors and residual disease >2 cm was poor,
averaging 7.1 months (95% CI, 4.6-9.6 months). CONCLUSIONS: Mucinous but not clear cell histology is
associated with significantly worse prognosis in advanced ovarian cancer treated with combination platinum/pacliC 2010 American Cantaxel. Different therapeutic strategies should be studied in this entity. Cancer 2010;116:1462–8. V

KEYWORDS: ovarian cancer, mucinous, clear cell, chemotherapy.

Epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) is the fourth most frequent cause of cancer death in women and the leading cause of
gynecologic cancer mortality, with around half of the cases occurring later than 65 years of age.1 Women more frequently
are diagnosed with advanced stages (International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics [FIGO] stages III-IV). The
standard treatment includes cytoreductive surgery and chemotherapy comprising a platinum analogue plus paclitaxel.2-5
Although platinum-based systemic chemotherapy has been proven to be effective, cure at these stages is infrequent because
of the development of resistance to chemotherapy.6 Nevertheless, prognosis is variable, largely depending on the time of
development of platinum resistance. Therefore, advanced ovarian cancer represents a heterogenous group regarding the
outcome after initial management. The identification of prognostic factors may aid selection of patients who might benefit
from different approaches.

Mucinous Histology in Ovarian Cancer/Bamias et al

Several clinical and histopathological factors influencing survival in advanced ovarian cancer have been
identified, such as quality of primary cytoreduction, age,
and tumor grade.7,8 Histological subtypes have also been
associated with different prognoses. In particular, clear
cell and mucinous carcinomas have been identified in previous studies as adverse prognostic features.7-9 Both histological subtypes are rare, comprising <10% of epithelial
ovarian cancers.10 It has been observed that both types
have a poor response to chemotherapy, contrasting with
that of serous histology, resulting in statistically lower 5year survival rates.9,11 Nevertheless, previous analyses suffer from limitations. The most important are the small
number of patients included (as expected because of the
rarity of these types) and the heterogeneity of chemotherapy used, because many studies have not included patients
treated with the current standard platinum/paclitaxel. In
addition, the quality of surgery has been improved with
time, and older series may not reflect the current practice
in advanced ovarian cancer.
In the present study, we studied the prognostic significance of mucinous and clear cell histology in stage III
and IV epithelial ovarian cancer in a cohort of patients
homogenously treated with a combination of platinum
and paclitaxel after initial cytoreduction.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients
From our EOC database, which includes patients receiving first-line chemotherapy in our department since April
1994, we selected only patients with the following criteria:
FIGO stages III-IV; serous, mucinous, or clear cell histology; and first-line chemotherapy with the combination of
paclitaxel and a platinum compound. Patients receiving
additional agents were also included. Only patients with
histological confirmation of the diagnosis were included
in this analysis. Patients with borderline or germ cell
tumors were excluded from the analysis.
All patients were operated on, received chemotherapy, and were followed up at our institution (Alexandra
Hospital, Athens, Greece). Patients who received their
first course of chemotherapy up to December 2007 were
included, to ensure at least 1 year of follow-up, as our
database was updated in December 2008.
Staging was performed according to the FIGO staging system. Residual disease after surgical debulking was
recorded according to the assessment by the surgeon. Tumor grading and histology were determined according to

current FIGO guidelines. Performance status was evaluated according to the Eastern Cooperative Oncology
Group (ECOG) standards immediately before the initiation of chemotherapy. Response to first-line therapy was
defined by computed tomography scan and CA-125 at
the end of chemotherapy; complete response (CR) was
defined as no radiological evidence of disease and normal
CA-125 levels (<37 IU/mL).
Statistical Analysis
Analyses were performed using SPSS statistical software
(SPSS for Windows, version 13; SPSS Inc., Chicago, Ill).
For descriptive purposes, continuous variables were presented as means and standard deviations; for categorical
purposes, percentages were used. Chi-square test was used
for comparisons of baseline characteristics between the
different histological subtypes.
Survival was calculated from the day of the initiation
of treatment until the date of death or date of last followup. Overall survival rates were calculated using the
Kaplan-Meier method, and the significance of differences
was determined using log-rank test. The variables analyzed
were age (<70 years vs 70 years), stage (III vs IV), grade
(1-2 vs 3), residual disease (2 cm vs >2 cm), and performance status (0 vs 1-3). Survival of mucinous and clear
cell carcinomas was compared with that of serous tumors.
Cox proportional hazards model was used for univariate
and multivariate analyses of survival. Variables with a P
value <.1 in the univariate analysis were entered in the
multivariate Cox regression model. Throughout analysis,
the level of 5% was used to denote statistical significance.

RESULTS
Patients
Between 1995 and 2007, a total of 513 patients with stage
III or IV ovarian cancer treated with paclitaxel/platinum
were identified in our database. Histologically, tumors were
grouped as 367 (71.5%) serous, 24 (4.7%) mucinous, 38
(7.4%) endometrioid, 29 (5.7%) clear cell, 29 (5.7%)
poorly differentiated, and 26 (5%) unspecified. As specified,
only patients with serous, mucinous, or clear cell histology
were included in this analysis. The baseline characteristics
of these patients according to the histological subtype as
well as treatment administered are shown in Table 1.
Median age of the present cohort was 61 years
(range, 18-87 years). Carboplatin was administered at
area under the curve 6,12 and creatinine clearance was calculated according to Cockroft and Gault13; cisplatin was

chemotherapy. A striking difference in response to chemotherapy was observed between serous and mucinous carcinomas; mucinous tumors showed significantly lower
CR and CR þ partial response compared with serous
tumors (59% vs 28%, P ¼ .013; 77% vs 45%, P ¼ .009,
respectively). No significant difference was observed
between serous and clear cell carcinomas.
Survival Analysis
The median follow-up for the entire cohort was 84
months. During follow-up, 254 patients died from the
disease: 217 among serous tumors, 17 among mucinous,
and 20 among clear cell tumors. The median overall survival (OS) for each histological subtype was 47.7 months
(95% confidence interval [CI], 37.7-57.7 months) for serous, 15.4 months (95% CI, 4.2-26.6 months) for mucinous, and 36.6 months (95% CI, 22.7-50.5 months) for
clear cell carcinomas. Log-rank test showed that mucinous
carcinomas had significantly shorter median OS compared with serous tumors (P ¼ .001) (Fig. 1). In contrast,
such a difference between clear cell and serous carcinomas
was not found (P ¼ .337) (Fig. 2).
Because of the imbalance in baseline characteristics
between the 3 histological subtypes, we performed multivariate analyses to study whether the differences in survival between mucinous or clear cell tumors and serous
carcinomas were independent from the other important
prognostic factors. These analyses confirmed that only
mucinous carcinomas showed significantly inferior survival compared with serous tumors (P ¼ .001) (Table 2),
and no difference was observed for clear cell carcinomas

(P ¼ .560). Patients with serous tumors had a 64% reduction in the risk of death compared with those patients
with mucinous tumors (hazard ratio [HR], 0.360; 95%
CI, 0.215-0.603). The other factors that showed an independent favorable association with survival were ECOG
PS 0 (HR, 0.591; 95% CI, 0.448-0.779) and residual disease 2 cm (HR, 0.413; 95% CI, 0.277-0.617).
Stratification by baseline PS and residual disease after cytoreductive surgery was used to perform separate
analyses of the importance of histology in different subgroups of patients with serous or mucinous histology.
Although no interaction between these variables and the
histological type was found, the median survival of
patients with mucinous tumors and residual disease >2
cm was poor, averaging 7.1 months (95% CI, 4.6-9.6
months) (P for interaction ¼ .224).

DISCUSSION
Traditionally, clear cell and mucinous histologies have
been associated with a worse overall survival compared
with serous ones.7 Nevertheless, information on the
prognostic significance of histology in the context of
changing therapeutic standards is limited. We retrospectively studied a large series of homogenously treated
patients, all with FIGO stage III or IV. In the interpretation of our results, the following factors should be
taken into consideration: retrospective analyses can
introduce selection biases, and treatment at relapse was
not homogenous. Despite these limitations, we believe
that our series is representative of contemporary practice
in ovarian cancer. All patients were operated on at our

center, which has a high volume of ovarian cancer, and
histopathological evaluation was performed by highly
experienced pathologists. The median survival of 47
months in serous carcinomas is comparable to that of
recent series in the taxane era.2,3,7 The composition of
our cohort regarding stage, histology, and grade distribution are also the expected for otherwise unselected
patients. Finally, our findings regarding prognosis are in
line with other studies, showing that performance status
and residual tumor volume are consistently independent
predictors of prognosis.7-9
Previous data on the prognostic significance of histologic subtypes were only partially confirmed. Whereas
mucinous histology was associated with significantly
worse survival, clear cell carcinomas were not. The reason
for this discrepancy is unclear. Most series showing an
association of clear cell type with adverse prognosis have
included a sizeable proportion of patients who did not
receive paclitaxel.9,10 The introduction of this agent has
changed the prognosis in advanced ovarian cancer, and
may have had an impact on this particular histological
subtype. Indeed, in a small series of 31 patients, a significantly higher risk ratio and longer OS were observed for
patients with clear cell carcinomas who received paclitaxel.14 This could be attributed to the different molecular
mechanisms underlying the resistance of these 2 agents.

1466

Clear cell has a platinum-resistant phenotype, which
could be partially attributed to p53 mutations described
in this neoplasm.15 The addition of paclitaxel may reverse
the relative resistance of clear cell tumors to platinum
therapy, because p53 mutations were not shown to negatively affect the antitumor effect of this combination.14,15
In 1 of these studies in particular, the addition of paclitaxel resulted in equally high response rates among
patients with mutated p53 with serous or clear cell histology,15 consistent with our results. It should be underlined
that the abovementioned data can only explain our results
to a point, because p53 mutations occur in the minority
of clear cell carcinomas. In contrast to these previous findings, in a recent retrospective study, including only
patients who received platinum/paclitaxel, clear cell histology was associated with significantly shorter survival
than serous carcinomas.7 The small sample size of clear
cell tumors in our series may account for the lack of statistical significance of the difference in OS between serous
and clear cell types. Nevertheless, the following points
should also be taken into consideration. The median survival for serous and mucinous carcinomas was identical to
ours, but clear cell tumors had a notably shorter median
survival of 24 months, compared with 36 months in our
cohort. Reported baseline characteristics were also similar,
suggesting that other, yet unidentifiable, factors may play

a role in the prognosis of this particular histological
subtype.
Paclitaxel-platinum chemotherapy was associated
with poor results in mucinous tumors compared with serous and clear cell tumors. The association of mucinous
histology with higher occurrence of stage IV disease and
PS > 0 could be responsible for this outcome. Nevertheless, this histological subtype was also associated with
favorable characteristics, such as more differentiated
tumors and higher percentage of residual disease 2 cm.
Furthermore, a multivariate analysis showed that mucinous histology was an independent factor of poor prognosis. This is consistent with results from recent studies
identifying this histological subtype as an adverse prognostic feature irrespective of other important factors, such
as surgical outcome.16 Again, differences in molecular
profile could, at least partially, explain this striking difference. P53 mutations are rare in mucinous histotypes, suggesting that the combination of a taxane with carboplatin
or cisplatin may be inadequate, as outlined above. It has
been suggested that other treatments used in mucinous
gastrointestinal carcinomas might be more useful.17 Preclinical data have suggested a synergism of oxaliplatin and
5-fluorouracil in cisplatin-resistant experimental models.18 This synergism results from down-regulation of the
excision-repair cross-complementation group 1 by 5-fluorouracil, resulting in enhanced sensitivity to oxaliplatin.
Furthermore, irinotecan, another effective agent in gastrointestinal malignancies, has been used in small series for
the treatment of these tumors with encouraging results.19
Nevertheless, these strategies have not been validated in
prospective randomized trials yet.
Median survival for patients with mucinous carcinomas and residual disease >2 cm was extremely poor,
averaging 7 months, with only a 2.5% probability of
being higher than 9.6 months. Our results suggest that
patients with ovarian tumors of mucinous histology are
not ideal candidates for interval debulking surgery.
Maximal surgical effort is currently the best option as
the initial management of these patients. If this is not
possible, the inclusion in clinical studies may represent
the best option for these patients. In this context, it is
encouraging that a higher percentage of residual disease
2 cm was observed among mucinous tumors compared with serous carcinomas.
In conclusion, histology remains an important determinant of prognosis in advanced ovarian cancer, but
the significance of each histological subtype may be
changing in the context of modern therapy for this dis-

ease. The treatment of mucinous tumors remains a challenge. Currently, optimal cytoreduction represents the
most important factor for long-term remission and should
be sought aggressively in these patients.
