ABSTRACT:
Chromosome maintenance region 1 (CRM1) also called Exportin 1 (Xpo1), a
protein found elevated in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), blocks tumor
suppressor protein (TSP) function through constant nuclear export. Earlier we had
shown that targeting CRM1 by our newly developed specific inhibitors of nuclear export
(SINE) leads to inhibition of pancreatic cancer cell proliferation and tumor growth
arrest. In this paper we define the mechanism of SINE action. Our lead SINE KPT185 inhibits PDAC cell growth, cell migration, tumor invasion and induces apoptosis
and G2-M cell cycle arrest in low nano molar range (IC50s~150 nM). Mechanistically
we demonstrate that the activity of KPT-185 is associated with nuclear retention
of Fbw7; which degrades nuclear Notch-1 leading to decreased tumor promoting
markers such as C-Myc, Cyclin-D1, Hes1 and VEGF. The orally bioavailable SINE (KPT251) showed potent anti-tumor activity in a Colo-357 PDAC xenografts model; residual
tumor analysis showed activation of Fbw7 concomitant with attenuation of Notch1
and its downstream genes. These results suggest that the antitumor activity of KPT185 is in part due to nuclear retention of Fbw7 and consequent Notch1 degradation.
The new CRM1 inhibitors, therefore, hold strong potential and warrant further clinical
investigations for PDAC.

INTRODUCTION

TSPs thereby inhibiting their cell surveillance activity
[3,4]. Therefore, blocking nuclear export machinery could
become a viable therapeutic strategy to restore tumor
suppressor functions as well as the apoptosis machinery
[5] .
Over-expression of nuclear Notch1 mediated
signaling in PDAC has been well established [6,7]. Notch1
carries a large single-pass type 1 trans-membrane receptor
that is activated by interaction with membrane bound
ligands [8]. For activation Notch1 receptors undergo
series of proteolytic cleavage resulting in the activation of
Notch1 intracellular domain (Notch1-IC) that translocates
into the nucleus [9]. The active forms of Notch1, along
with other transcription factors, regulate the expression

Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is the
fourth deadliest disease that accounts for ~38,000 annual
deaths in the United States [1], suggesting that newer and
effective treatment strategies are critically needed. The
majority of PDAC patients become refractory to standard
chemotherapeutic drugs such as gemcitabine and 5FU or
their combination [2]. In principle, most chemotherapeutic
drugs work through activation and nuclear localization of
tumor suppressor proteins (TSPs) such as p53, FOXO,
p27 and IkB. However, in PDAC and other cancers,
aberrant over-expression of nuclear exporter protein

of many tumor promoting genes [10]. Fbw7 (also known
as Fbxw7, SEL-10, hCdc4, or hAgo) is the F-box protein
subunit of a Skp1-Cul1-F-box protein (SCF)-type
ubiquitin ligase complex that plays an important role in
the degradation of Notch family members including the
activated Notch1C in the nucleus [11,12]. Nevertheless,
mislocalization of Fbw7 by CRM1 over-expression results
in Notch1 nuclear accumulation and consequent activation
of tumor promoting pathways. Therefore, we hypothesize
that CRM1 inhibition could potentially restore nuclear
Fbw7 leading to degradation of nuclear Notch1 thereby
inducing PDAC cell death.
Using structure based drug design, we have
recently developed specific inhibitors of nuclear export
(SINE Fig 1A & B). NCI 60 cell line screening shows
that the inhibitors have broad tumor specificity and low
nano molar potency. Recently, we showed that SINE
can suppress proliferation of PDAC [13] and NHL
[14] cell lines and induce tumor growth arrest in their
corresponding sub-cutaneous and orthotopic tumor
models. Most significantly, SINEs do not induce growth
inhibition and apoptosis in normal peripheral lymphocytes,
NIH-3T3 cells or mouse fibroblast. Additionally, SINEs
have excellent pharmacokinetic parameters, have passed
advanced toxicity profiling and are currently in phase
I clinical trials for solid tumors and hematological
malignancies. Using these promising inhibitors, in this
study, we investigated their mechanism of action in a
panel of PDAC lines and animal tumor model explained
in the light of Fbw7-Notch.

presented in Figure 2 A. KPT-185 inhibits cell growth in
a dose dependent manner in all the three cell lines (IC50s
~150 nM). To confirm the effects of KPT-185 on cell
growth, clonogenic assay was performed. Fig 2 B and C
show a dose dependent inhibition of clonogenic potential
by KPT-185 in Colo-357 and BxPC-3 cells. The results
from the clonogenic assay were consistent with the MTT
data shown suggesting that KPT-185 inhibited cell growth
in BxPC-3, Colo-357 PDAC cells.

Inhibition of cell migration and invasion by KPT185
Notch over-expressing cells such as BxPC-3 and
Colo-357 demonstrate high proliferation and migratory
properties. In order to examine whether KPT-185 can
prevent their migratory and invasive potential, we
conducted wound healing and invasion assays. As shown
in Fig. 3 A, KPT-185 inhibited cell migration in a dose
dependent manner in both BxPC-3 and Colo-357 PDAC
cells. The results of Fig. 3 B clearly show that KPT-185
treated BxPC-3 and Colo-357 cells decrease in their
invasive capability as compared to the untreated control.
These results confirm that KPT-185 can inhibit cell
migration and invasion and whether this results in cell
growth arrest was investigated as shown below.

KPT-185 induces cell cycle arrest in PDAC cells
In order to verify whether KTP-185 works by
abrogating cell cycle progression, propidium iodide
flow cytometry assays were performed. BxPC-3 cells
were exposed to 75 and 100 nM of KPT-185 for 72 hrs
and analyzed for cell cycle distribution. As expected,
increasing concentrations of KPT-185 resulted in G2-M
arrest patterns (Fig 4). Similar results were obtained for
Colo-357 cells (data not shown). These findings further
solidify the case for KPT-SINEs as effect agents against
PDAC. We further investigated the apoptotic potential
and also evaluated the mechanism supporting KPT-185

cycle arrest and apoptosis, alterations in the cell survival
pathway were investigated using Western blot analysis
with especial emphasis on Notch1 signaling. BxPC-3
and Colo-357 cell lines treated with KPT-185 for 72 hrs
were assessed using real-time reverse transcription-PCR
(RT-PCR) analysis. As shown in Fig. 6 A, the mRNA
expression of Hes1 gene decreased after KPT-185
treatment in both cell lines. Additionally the effect of KPT185 on Fbw7 nuclear export in PC cells was assessed by
subjecting nuclear extracts from KPT-185 treated BxPC-3
and Colo-357 cells to Western blotting. As shown in Fig.
6 B, compared to control, KPT-185 treatment (0-150 nM),
leads to significantly enhanced accumulation of Fbw7 with
concomitant down-regulation of Notch1 protein. Most
significantly, we also observed down-regulation of Notch
pathway proteins (Hes-1, C-myc, VEGF and CyclinD).
These results solidify our hypothesis that KPT-185 works
through nuclear retention of the Notch suppressor Fbw7.
Based on these strong in vitro findings we investigated
the in vivo potential of analog KPT-251 in xenograft
developed from Colo-357 cell lines.

KPT-185 induces apoptosis in PDAC cell lines
In order to verify that growth inhibition by KPT-185
in PDAC is due to induction of apoptosis Histone DNA
ELISA assays were performed. Histone DNA ELISA
is a highly sensitive assay that quantitatively measures
apoptotic cell death. As demonstrated in Fig. 5 and in
line with the MTT and colonogenic assays, increasing
concentrations of KPT-185 induced a progressive increase
in apoptosis in three PC cell lines BxPC-3 (Fig. 5 A),
MIAPaCa (Fig. 5 B) and Colo-357 (Fig. 5 C). These
results confirm that KPT-185 is a potent apoptosis inducer
in PC and we further sought to investigate its mechanism
of action as presented below.

DISCUSSION

Pre-clinical efficacy trial of KPT-SINE

This study shows that CRM1 inhibition and
consequent nuclear retention of tumor suppressor proteins
by specific inhibitors of nuclear export could become a
therapeutic strategy for PDAC. Mechanistically we have
discovered that our CRM1 inhibitors work through a novel
Fbw7 nuclear retention mediated notch1 suppressive
mechanism that could be replicated both in vitro and
in vivo. Based on these strong pre-clinical findings, we
propose that our novel CRM1 inhibitors hold strong
translational potential and warrant further clinical
investigations in PDAC.
The majority of PC patients are intractable to
currently available treatment modalities [15]. A major
reason for failure chemotherapeutic agents such as
gemcitabine, platinum based drugs and 5FU has been
attributed to inadequate activation of tumor suppressor
proteins [16]. In instances where TSPs are activated, their
function is inhibited by mislocalization through constant
nuclear export by CRM1 protein [17]. CRM1 is the major
TSPs and its importance can be gauged by the observation
that the protein is found over-expressed in most cancers
including PDAC [3]. Therefore, targeted inhibition of the
nuclear exporter CRM1 becomes an attractive therapeutic
strategy for the treatment of PC. Earlier attempts to target

For in vivo studies we challenged SCID mice
carrying Colo-357 sc tumors with the orally available
analog KPT-251 (Fig 7 A for schema of treatment).
SINEs have been developed as safe anti-tumor agents for
cancer therapy and do not show toxicity. Body weight
of the host animal remains stable during the course of
treatment with the Maximum tolerated dose (MTD)
of KPT-251, calculated to be 75 mg/kg sc for 20 days,
(Fig 7 B). Most significantly, and in line with the in
vitro results, oral administration of KPT-251 at 75 mg/
kg resulted in drastic tumor regression in the Colo-357
animal models (Fig 7 C). To further investigate whether
KPT-251 down-regulates Notch1 in vivo, we examined
Notch1 expression in tumor tissues obtained from KPT251-treated animals. As expected, Western blot analyses of
animal tissues demonstrated significant down-regulation
of Notch1 and its related proteins (c-myc and VEGF Fig
7 D). Interestingly, we observed induction of Fbw7 and
suppression of Notch1 in KPT-251 treated tumors (Fig.
7 E). These data show that KPT holds strong anti-tumor
potential and warrant further clinical application for the
treatment of PDAC.

CRM1 led to development of agents such as Leptomycin
B (LMB), although specific inhibitors of CRM1, yet
showed adverse off target toxicities [18].
To overcome toxicity, we have developed novel
highly specific non-toxic small molecules capable of
antagonizing the functions of CRM1 [19]. Unlike,
Leptomycin B that form an irreversible covalent bond
with Cys528 of CRM1, KPT-185 bind to CRM1 in a
slowly reversible fashion, which might contribute to the
improved tolerability of the SINE compounds. SINE
block nuclear export of TSPs thereby inducing growth
inhibition and apoptosis specifically in cancer cells
[20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28]. Earlier, our group has
studied the impact of CRM1 inhibtion in PDAC models
and the downstream signaling analysis [13]. These studies
deciphered the downstream targets including FOXO3a,
p27, p21 and the pro-apoptotic protein prostate apoptosis
response 4 (PAR-4) mediated effects both in vitro as
well as in animal models of PDAC. In the current study,
we investigated the anti-tumor potential and molecular
mechanism of action by which our CRM1 inhibitors elicit

their biological effects in PDAC cells and tumor models.
The lead CRM1 inhibitor KPT-185 effectively caused
growth inhibition, suppressed colonogenic potential and
induced G2-M cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in a panel of
PDAC cell lines. As such these investigations proved the
potential of KPT-185 as new anti-cancer agents for PDAC.
The TSP Fbw7, among the nuclear export targets
of CRM1, plays a central role in the degradation of
Notch family members. Fbw7 has been recently shown
to exert its anti-tumor effects through degradation of
Notch1 [29]. Some reports have shown that Fbw7 binds to
phosphorylated Notch 1C and mediates its ubiquitination
and subsequent rapid degradation [30]. Additionally,
Fbw7 exerts its inhibitory effect by regulating Notch1
downstream signaling pathways through ubiquitin
ligase mediated degradation [31]. However, there are no
available agents that enhance FBW7 or induce its nuclear
retention. These key observations led to our hypothesis
that targeted inhibition of CRM1 and nuclear retention
of Fbw7 could become a viable therapeutic strategy for
PDAC. In line with our hypothesis we observed that

MATERIALS AND METHODS

treatment with KPT-185 resulted in nuclear accumulation
of Fbw7 with consequent down-regulation of Notch1 and
related pathways (Hes-1, C-Myc and VEGF) in PDAC
cells and this was correlated with our growth inhibition,
cell cycle arrest and apoptosis data.
Prior to clinical application of a new therapeutic
agent, such as SINEs, pre-clinical evaluation in a suitable
animal model is required. Therefore, we tested the in
vivo potential of the drugs in xenograft models derived
from Colo-357 cells that are recognized to over-express
Notch. In line with our in vitro growth inhibition and
apoptosis results, the analog KPT-251 showed remarkable
anti-tumor activity in the Colo-357 model and most
importantly had no visible toxicity to host animals. Of
paramount significance is the observation that in residual
tumors we could replicate the in vitro mechanistic findings
and observed clear activation of Fbw7 and suppression of
Notch signaling.
In summary, we have provided experimental
evidence that supports the role of SINEs as antitumor
agent for PDAC. Mechanistically, we propose that our
SINEs attenuate Notch1 signaling, cell proliferation,
invasion and induce apoptosis in PC cells by degradation
of Notch1 through nuclear retention of Fbw7 (Synopsis
graphical abstract for summary mechanistic schema).
However, further studies are needed to confirm the
molecular regulation of Notch1 by SINE induced-Fbw7
expression prior to their clinical application for PDAC.

Cell culture and experiment reagents.
Human PDAC cell lines BxPC-3, Colo-357 and
MIAPaCa used in this study were obtained from ATCC
and maintained in standard cell culture conditions (at
37 °C in a humidified 5 % CO2 atmosphere). Primary
antibody for Notch1, CyclinD1, VEGF were purchased
from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA),
Fbw7 and Hes-1 were purchased from the Abcam (San
Francisco, CA), C-myc, Bcl-2 were purchased from Cell
signaling (Danvers, MA). The secondary antibodies were
bought from Sigma (St. Louis, MO). SINEs (KPT-185
and KPT-251) were designed, synthesized and purified by
Karyopharm Therapeutic (Natick, MA).

Cell viability Studies by MTT assay.
The BxPC-3, Colo-357 and MIAPaCa cells (5×103)
were seeded in a 96-well culture plate. 24 hrs after seeding,
cells were treated with various concentrations of most
potent KPT-SINE KPT-185 for 24, 48, and 72 hrs. At the
end of treatment period, 10 uL of Reagent MTT (Sigma
Chemical Company 5 mg/mL in PBS) was added to each
well. After 2 hrs incubation 100 µL of Isopropanol was
added to each well and further incubated for 20 minutes

containing propidium iodide (50 µg/mL), and DNase-free
RNase A (100 µg/mL). Samples were then incubated at 37
°C for 15 min, and DNA contents were determined by flow
cytometry using a flow cytometer (BD, San Jose, CA) by
the Karmanos Cancer Institute Flow cytometry core.

Clonogenic assay.
To test the survival of cells treated with KPT-185,
BxPC-3 and Colo-357 cells were plated (3×105 per well)
in a six-well plate and incubated overnight. After 72 hrs
exposure to various concentrations of KPT-185, the viable
cells were counted and plated in 100 mm dishes in a range
of 3,000 cells per plate. The cells were then incubated for
21 days at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere.
All the colonies were fixed in 4 % Paraformaldehyde and
stained with 2 % crystal violet.

Histone/DNA ELISA for detection of apoptosis.
The Cell Death Detection ELISA Kit (Roche
Applied Science, Indianapolis, IN) was used to detect
apoptosis in pancreatic cells. 3×105 cells were seeded in
six-well plates. After 24 hrs incubation, cells were treated
with various concentrations of KPT-185 for 72 hrs. The
cells were then lysed, and cytoplasmic histone/DNA
fragments were extracted and incubated in microtiter
plate modules coated with anti-histone antibody. In
order to detect the immobilized histone/DNA fragment,
Peroxidase-conjugated anti-DNA antibody was used
before color development with ABTS substrate for
peroxidase. The spectrophotometric absorbance of
the sample was determined by TECAN’s microplate
fluorometer (TECAN, Switzerland) at 405 nm.

Wound healing assay
Wound healing assay was conducted to examine the
capacity of cell migration. BxPC-3 and Colo-357 were
seeded in a six well plate at the concentration of 3×105
cells per well. The wound was generated in the cells with
90-95 % confluent by scratching the surface of the plates
with a sterile pipette tip. The cells were then incubated in
the absence and presence of KPT-185 for 20 hrs, and then
photographed with a Nikon microscope.

Protein extraction and western blotting
For protein extraction, KPT-185 treated cells were
sonicated in 125 mM Tris-HCl and 4 % SDS according
to our previously published methods [32]. In another set
of experiments, cytoplasmic and nuclear proteins were
also extracted using NE-PER Nuclear and Cytoplasmic
Extraction Reagents (Thermo Scientific, Rockford,
IL). The protein concentrations were determined using
the BCATM protein assay reagent (Thermo Scientific,
Rockford, IL). Proteins were fractionated using sodium
dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDSPAGE), and the gels were transferred onto nitrocellulose
membrane. The membranes were blocked with 4 % nonfat
dried milk or bovine serum albumin in 1×PBS containing
0.1 % Tween-20 and then incubated over night at 4 °C
with appropriate primary antibodies. The membranes
were washed 3 times with PBS-T, and subsequently
incubated with the secondary antibodies for 2 hrs at room
temperature. The protein bands were detected using the
enhanced chemiluminesence detection system (Genscript,
Piscataway, NJ).

Cell invasion assay
BD Biocoat invasion kit (BD, San Jose, CA) was
used to evaluate the tumor invasive ability. Briefly,
around 2.5×104 cells of BxPC-3 and Colo-357 with basal
media was transferred in each 6-well upper chamber in
the presence or absence of KPT-185. 0.75 milliliter of
culture medium with 5 % FBS was added into each bottom
chamber of 6-well plate. After 20 hrs of incubation, the
cells in the upper chamber were removed, and the cells
that had invaded through Matrigel matrix membrane
were stained with 4 μg/mL calcein AM in PBS at 37 °C,
5 % CO2 for 1 hr. The fluorescence of the invaded cells
was read in ULTRA Multifunctional Microplate Reader
(TECAN, Switzerland) at excitation/emission wavelengths
of 485/530 nm. These fluorescently labeled invasive cells
were also photographed under a fluorescent microscope.

Flow cytometry and cell cycle analysis.

Real-time quantitative PCR for gene expression
analysis

Cells were seeded in 100 mm dish per plate,
incubated overnight. Subsequently, all the cells were
serum starved for another 24 hrs. The cells were exposed
vehicle (DMSO) or KPT-185 and grown for 72 hr. At
the end of treatment period, cells were collected and
fixed with ice-cold 70 % (v/v) ethanol for 24 hr. After
centrifugation at 3000×g for 5 min, the cell pellets were
washed with PBS (pH 7.4) and resuspended in PBS

approved protocols at Wayne State University.

Immunohistochemical determination of Notch1
and Fbw7.
The expression of Notch1 and Fbw7 was detected
in histologic sections of tumor xenografts. Sections were
cut from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue blocks;
collected on 3-ethoxy-aminoethyl-silane-treated slides; and
allowed to dry overnight at 37 °C. Sections were dewaxed
in xylene, rehydrated through graded concentrations of
ethanol to distilled water, immersed in 10 mmol/L citrate
buffer (pH 6.0), and processed in a thermostatic water bath
for 40 minutes at 98°C for antigen retrieval. Anti-Notch1,
and anti-Fbw7 antibodies were applied on two slides for
each case, and incubations were done overnight at room
temperature in a humidified atmosphere followed by a
30-minute incubation of secondary antibody. Slides were
then incubated with streptavidin peroxidase and visualized
using the 3,3′-diaminobenzidine chromogen (Lab Vision
Corp., Fremont, CA).

Colo-357 xenografts

Tumor Tissue proteins isolation and western blot
analysis:

Four-week-old female ICR-SCID mice were
obtained from Taconic Laboratory and xenografts were
developed by injecting 107 Colo-357 cells s.c. in each
flank area. When s.c. tumors developed to about 1,500
mg, the tumors were excised, and serial propagation was
accomplished by trimming extraneous material, cutting
the tumors into fragments of 50 mg, which were then
transplanted s.c. into the flanks of a new group of mice
for maintenance of tumors as well as for experimental
purpose. For the subsequent drug efficacy trials, small
fragments of the Colo-357 xenograft were implanted
s.c. and bilaterally into naive, similarly adapted mice
(n=20). Mice were checked 3 times per week for tumor
development. Once transplanted, Colo-357 fragments
developed into palpable tumors (60–100 mg); animals
were removed randomly and assigned to different
treatment groups (10 per group). Using this model, the
efficacy of KPT-251 (analog of KPT-185, used in vivo)
was studied. The maximum tolerated dose of KPT-251 in
severe combined immunodeficient mice was determined
to be 75 mg/kg. Mice were administered with KPT-251
at 25 or 75 mg/kg orally, for 2 weeks. (as shown in Fig
6A.). Mice in the control and KPT-251 treated group were
followed for measurement of s.c. tumors, changes in body
weight and side effects of the drugs. Tumor was calculated
using the formula (A ×B2)/2, where A and B are the tumor
length and width (in mm). To avoid discomfort in the
control group, animals were euthanized when their total
tumor burden reached 2,000 mg. Tumor tissues harvested
from this experiment were used for immunohistochemical
and Western blotting analyses. All studies involving mice

At the end of the treatment period tumors were
excised and one part was minced for protein isolation
according to our previously published methods. 100 µg
tumor protein lysates were resolved using western blotting
assay. The membranes were probed for Notch1, C-myc,
VEGF and β-actin.
Data Analysis: Data are represented as mean ±
SD for the absolute values or percentage of controls as
indicated in the vertical axis legend of figures. The statistic
significance of differential findings between experimental
groups and control groups was statistically evaluated
ANOVA using GraphPad StatMate software (GraphPad
Software, Inc., San Diego, CA). p values lower than 0.05
were considered statistically significant.
