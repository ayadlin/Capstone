ABSTRACT
Background: The design of a highly effective anti-cancer immune-engager
would include targeting of highly drug refractory cancer stem cells (CSC). The design
would promote effective antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) and
simultaneously promote costimulation to expand and self-sustain the effector NK
cell population. Based on our bispecific NK cell engager platform we constructed a
tetraspecific killer engager (TetraKE) comprising single-chain variable fragments
(scFvs) binding FcγRIII (CD16) on NK cells, EpCAM on carcinoma cells and CD133
on cancer stem cells in order to promote ADCC. Furthermore, an Interleukin (IL)-15crosslinker enhanced NK cell related proliferation resulting in a highly active drug
termed 1615EpCAM133.
Results: Proliferation assays showed TetraKE promoted proliferation and
enhanced NK cell survival. Drug-target binding, NK cell related degranulation, and
IFN-γ production was specific for both tumor related antigens in EpCAM and CD133
bearing cancer cell lines. The TetraKE showed higher killing activity and superior dose
dependent degranulation. Cytokine profiling showed a moderately enhanced IFN-γ
production, enhanced GM-CSF production, but no evidence of induction of excessive
cytokine release.
Methods: Assembly and synthesis of hybrid genes encoding the TetraKE were
performed using DNA shuffling and ligation. The TetraKE was tested for efficacy,
specificity, proliferation, survival, and cytokine production using carcinoma cell lines
and functional assays measuring NK cell activity.
Conclusion: 1615EpCAM133 combines improved induction of ADCC with enhanced
proliferation, limited cytokine response, and prolonged survival and proliferation of
NK cells. By linking scFv-related targeting of carcinoma and CSCs with a sustaining
IL-15 signal, our new construct shows great promise to target cancer and CSCs.

ovary, and stomach cancer [1], CD19 for acute lymphatic
leukemia (Blinatumomab) [2] and EpCAM for cancer
related ascites (Catumaxomab). However BiTEs can
induce harmful cytokine release related toxicity leading
to patient disorders, thereby limiting the dose [3]. In
BiTEs, CD3 engagement induces interleukin (IL)-2
release contributing to cytokine toxicity. We believe that
engaging NK effector cells may provide a better safety

INTRODUCTION
Immune engagers show promising results in cancer
treatment and already demonstrate some clinical success.
T cells as well as NK cells are the main effector cells
that can be harnessed for cancer defence. Evidence now

profile in vitro and in vivo. In order to engage NK cells,
bispecific NK cell engagers (BiKEs) were synthesized
forming an immune synapse between NK cells and cancer
cells [4–8]. A problem is that all of these BiKEs are
limited by an inability to facilitate NK cell expansion, as
CD16 ligation does not trigger proliferation. To resolve
this issue we incorporated modified IL-15 as a cross-linker
between the scFv to form an IL-15 TetraKE that could
induce expansion and proliferation. IL-15 is arguably the
best-known natural regulator of NK cell homeostasis and
development and is therefore an important factor in NKmediated immune surveillance [9].
NK cells are cytotoxic lymphocytes widely
acknowledged for their potential to control cancer and
for their role in immunosurveillance [10]. NK cells are
regulated by a repertoire of inhibitory and activation surface
receptors. They have the ability to recognize stressed cells in
the absence of MHC by stimulation of activating receptors
such as NKG2D and natural cytotoxicity receptors. NK
cells also highly express CD16, a potent activation receptor
that binds to the Fc portion of IgG antibodies, which
has a central role in providing antibody-dependent cellmediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) [11]. NK cells are regulated
by IL-15, which can induce increased antigen dependent
cytotoxicity, lymphokine-activated killer activity and
also mediation of Interferon (IFN), tumor-necrosis factor
(TNF) and Granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating
factor (GM-CSF) responses [12–14]. All of these IL-15
activated functions contribute to improved cancer defense
(as reviewed in [15]).
In this study, we targeted the epithelial cell adhesion
molecule (EpCAM) with an anti-EpCAM scFv and CD133
with anti-CD133 scFv. The EpCAM molecule is known
to be a marker of great therapeutic interest for targeting
carcinoma and is overexpressed in a myriad of different
carcinoma tissues such as colon, ovary, breast and prostate
cancer. Involvement in prognostically relevant factors
like enhanced tumor proliferation, resistance to chemoand radiotherapy, reduced overall-survival, and selective
expression on epithelial cells, make EpCAM a valuable
marker for cancer targeting [16, 17]. EpCAM is connected
to the Wnt/β-catenin pathways, implying relevance in
physiologic and cancer stem-cell (CSC) regulation.
CD133 was targeted because it is expressed on
CSC that cause drug resistant relapse by promoting
tumor initiation and self-propagation of cancer cells.
CD133 is a pentaspan transmembrane protein which
is also associated with the Wnt/ß-catenin pathway
and thus with cell proliferation [18, 19]. CD133 has a
negative impact in patient survival when detected on
cancer cells [20, 21]. Drugs have been created targeting
CD133 including targeted toxins (C178ABC-CD133Mab,
dEpCAMCD133KDEL, CD133NPs, dCD133KDEL)
[22–25] and BiKEs (CD16133) [4] showing high efficacy
in tumor elimination in vitro and in vivo even in tumors
with only a small number of CD133-expressing cells.

In this paper, we engineered the TetraKE
1615EpCAM133 to simultaneously engage EpCAM and
CD133 increasing its targeting capability to target cancer
cells and CSC alike. By including IL-15 in our construct
we improved the action by rendering the molecule capable
of NK cell expansion. We show that our TetraKE is highly
specific against EpCAM and CD133 bearing cells, is
capable of both NK cell mediated ADCC and NK cell
expansion, and represents a promising new therapeutic
modality.

RESULTS
Engineering of 1615EpCAM133
The design of the engineered protein is shown in
Figure 1A. After harvesting and refolding processes fast
flow sepharose procedure was performed and showed
an appropriate size related peak as shown in Figure 1B.
Densitometric evaluation of purity revealed 90% when
analyzed in SDS-page. Compared to the molecular weight
(MW) standard the produced protein showed a MW
of 95,900 Da and confirmed the sequence derived size
estimation (Figure 1C).

Specificity in binding
To evaluate specificity of our drug, flow cytometry
based blocking assays were performed with HT-29
(EpCAM+, CD133-) and Caco-2 (EpCAM+, CD133+)
colon carcinoma cell lines. In this assay a FITC-labeled
1615EpCAM133 TetraKE competes with saturating
concentrations of unlabeled anti-EpCAM scFv, DT2219,
anti-CD133 scFv, and a combination of anti-CD133 scFv
and anti-EpCAM scFv (1000nM respectively). In HT-29
cells, the TetraKE bound >98% of cells. Blocking with
either anti-EpCAM scFv or anti-EpCAM combined
with anti-CD133 scFv led to a reduction in binding,
whereas anti-CD133 scFv alone as well as the control
drug DT2219 showed minimal blocking capability (HT29 cells do not express CD22 and CD19 and a minimum
of CD133) (Figure 2A). In Caco-2 cells, where TetraKE
binds >83%, blocking with either anti-EpCAM or antiCD133 scFv led to a reduction of binding. Blocking with
anti-EpCAM combined with anti-CD133 scFv led to the
highest level of blocking since both tumor related antigens
are targeted by the TetraKE (Figure 2B). The control with
CD2219 (a bispecific antibody consisting of anti-CD22
scFv spliced to anti-CD19 scFv) showed no blocking
capability. Experiments were repeated with 500nM of
1615EpCAM133. Results were reproducible.
Biologic validation of IL-15 moiety
The capability of the IL-15 moiety within the drug
to induce proliferation and survival is shown in Figure
2C-2F. We exposed purified NK cells to 50 nM of an

anti-CD16 scFv, anti-CD133 scFv, 1615EpCAM133
TetraKE, DT2219 (mutated diphtheria toxin linked to an
anti-CD22 and an anti-CD19 scFv), anti-EpCAM scFv,
EpCAM16 BiKE and IL-15 (NCI). Expansion index,
which determines overall expansion of the culture, showed
significantly enhanced expansion in the TetraKE and in
the IL-15 groups (p<0.001), (Figure 2C). To compare the
ability of our modified IL-15 linker to induce proliferation,
PBMCs or purified NK cells were cultured after staining
with a reactive dye and exposed to 50 nM of EpCAM16
BiKE or 1615EpCAM133 TetraKE. After incubation,
flow cytometry analysis was performed on gated CD56+
CD3- cells to evaluate NK cells and on CD56-CD3+ cells
to evaluate T-cells. In Figure 2D, only NK cells treated
with the TetraKE showed substantial proliferation.
Treatment with EpCAM16 BiKE did not.The ability to
induce specific proliferation to NK cells is shown in Figure
2E. T-cells did not proliferate after exposure to TetraKE.
To study the ability of the TetraKE to enhance survival of
NK cells, purified NK cells were cultured for 7 days with

30 nM of 1615EpCAM133 TetraKE or EpCAM16 BiKE.
At the end of culture viability staining, using Live/Dead
Dye, showed much higher percentages of live NK cells in
the TetraKE group (Figure 2F).

Activity of 1615EpCAM133
1615EpCAM133 activity was evaluated with
standard 51chromium release assays in order to measure the
drug’s ability to mediate NK cell killing of cancer cells.
Therefore we used Caco-2 (CD133+, EpCAM+) and HT-29
(CD133-, EpCAM+) targets and performed the assay with
freshly isolated NK cells of two donors for each cancer
cell line (Figure 3A, 3B) and (3C, 3D) respectively. Beside
1615EpCAM133 TetraKE, no antibody, anti-CD16 scFv,
anti-CD133 scFv, anti-EpCAM scFv, IL-15 alone and
EpCAM16 BiKE were added as controls. In all donors and
in both cancer cell types, 1615EpCAM133 and EpCAM16
showed superior killing when compared to other controls
at increasing Effector:Target (E:T) ratios.

Dose dependent degranulation capability

CD107a surface expression and intracellular IFN-γ
production by flow cytometry and used NK cells cocultured with HT-29 targets and negative control HL-60
targets. In the HT-29 group, 1615EpCAM133 showed
significantly elevated degranulation with target cell
exposure (p<0.001) compared to the following controls:
Effectors (E)+Targets (T) alone, E+T+anti-EpCAM
scFv, E+T+anti-CD16 scFv, E+T+ IL-15 cloned in our
lab, E+T+IL-15 NCI derived, E+T+CD2219, E+T+antiCD133 scFv (Figure 5A). The HL-60 cell line served as a
negative control and showed no significant degranulation
activity with all applied drugs tested (Figure 5B). IFN-γ
production was significantly enhanced against HT29 cells when NK cells were exposed to the TetraKE
(p<0.001) (Figure 5C). NK cells exposed to HL60 targets showed minimal induction of IFN-γ with
monomeric IL-15 or TetraKE, mediated likely by IL-15
signaling, (Figure 5D).

In order to study dose dependent NK cell
degranulation, CD107a surface expression was evaluated
as it represents a degranulation marker for NK cells and
allows for evaluation of degranulation on a per cell basis.
PBMCs were cultured with 1615EpCAM133, EpCAM16
and 16133 in increasing concentrations (0.1, 1, 5, 10,
30, 50 nM). At 0.1 nM concentration, no differences in
activity were seen. At higher concentrations, the TetraKE
showed significantly superior degranulation induction
compared to EpCAM16 and 16133. (Figure 4).

Specificity in degranulation and IFN-γ
production
For assessment of specificity in induction of lytic
degranulation and IFN-γ production, we evaluated

Degranulation and IFN-γ production against
various cell lines

Cytokine production
In order to evaluate a broader cytokine profile,
purified NK cells were co-cultured with HT-29 colon
carcinoma cell line. After 24 hours of incubation,
supernatant was analyzed for hallmark cytokines of
inflammation. A significant difference in GM-CSF
production between 1615EpCAM133 to no drug (p<0.01)
but no difference between TetraKE and EpCAM16 BiKE
was seen (Figure 8A). Concerning IL-6 production, no
difference between TetraKE and BiKE was noted (Figure
8B). IL-8 production showed no difference between
TetraKE and BiKE (Figure 8C).TNF-α evaluation showed
no difference between TetraKE and BiKE but we saw a
significant difference between both drugs compared to
E+T alone (p<0.05) (Figure 8D).

TetraKE induces enhanced functionality against
a broad range of cancer cell lines. To evaluate drug
performance in EpCAM positive cancer entities, various
cell lines comprising breast (BT-474 (Figure 6A), SK-BR-3
(Figure 6B)), prostate (PC-3 (Figure 6C), DU145 (Figure
6D)), Head and Neck (UMSCC-11B (Figure 6E)) and
ovarian carcinoma (SKOV-1 (Figure 6F)) were analyzed.
These respective cancer cell lines were co-cultured with
PBMCs and 1615EpCAM133, NCI derived IL-15, 16133 or
EpCAM16. With all cell lines, the TetraKE induced variable
but higher NK cell CD107a expression compared to
controls (p<0.001) and with the breast cancer cell line BT474, 1615EpCAM133 was significantly superior compared
to EpCAM16 BiKE (p<0.05).
The same effectors and target cells were evaluated
for IFN-γ production. All breast cancer subtypes as well as
PC-3 prostate cancer cell line (Figure 7A, 7B, 7C) induced
significantly elevated NK cell IFN-γ production (p<0.05)
when exposed to the TetraKE and EpCAM16 BiKE. All
other cell lines shown in Figure 7 (DU145 (D), UMSCC11B (E) and SKOV-1 (F)) showed no significantly
enhanced IFN-γ production with TetraKE or of BiKE
compared to controls.

DISCUSSION
The original contribution of this work is a selfsustaining TetraKE comprising an anti-CD16 scFv for
NK cell engagement, anti-EpCAM scFv for carcinoma
recognition, anti-CD133 scFv for CSC recognition, and
an IL-15 cross-linker to sustain the NK cell response.
Our TetraKE is capable of inducing dual antigen specific
ADCC and specific delivery of an IL-15 signal to the

NK cell-target synapse. This leads to improved activity,
induction of proliferation, and prolongation of survival
of NK cell effectors. These properties were not seen in
an anti-EpCAM BiKE [6] and an anti-CD133 BiKE
[4] previously reported by our group. Our group has
developed IL-15 TriKEs targeting singular cancerassociated markers [26, 27]. However, this is the first of its
kind IL-15 driven TetraKE targeting two cancer markers
simultaneously, one of them an established marker on
cancer stem cells, CD133 [28].
The central core of NK cell mediated ADCC by
an engineered bispecific antibody is targeting the Fcγ
receptor III (CD16) with one ligand and a cancer cell
target with the other ligand. This forms an immune
synapse resulting in cytotoxic degranulation. This
construction shows efficacy in targeting hematologic
malignancies [7, 29] as well as solid tumors [4].
Regarding hematologic cancers, a phase I clinical trial
with a bispecific monoclonal antibody simultaneously
targeting CD16 and the Hodgkin and Reed-Sternberg
cell-associated CD30 antigen (HRS-3/A9) showed one

complete and one partial remission (CR/PR) out of 9
patients [30]. In a second randomized pilot trial, the same
drug showed one CR and three PR out of 16 patients
[31]. Gleason et al. evaluated a BiKE and a TriKE
scFv construct targeting CD16/CD19 and CD16/CD19/
CD22 expressed on B-cell malignancies and showed
stability of the constructs in human serum and selective
killing of a Burkitt-lymphoma cell line [5]. Kugler
et al. created a dual targeting scFv triplebody specific
for Interleukin-3 receptor α chain (CD123), CD33 and
CD16 showing responses against acute myeloid leukemia
(AML)-cell lines [8]. Focusing on solid tumor markers,
2B1, a bispecific murine monoclonal antibody with
bispecificity for ErbB2 and CD16 was tested in a phase
I clinical trial and showed responses in breast cancer
patients [32]. A BiKE produced for targeting CD16 and
EpCAM receptors killed various EpCAM bearing cell
lines [6]. An anti-CD133 BiKE killed CD133+ colorectal
cells [4]. Although highly effective, none of these BiKE
constructions were as capable of a self-sustained NK
expansion as our IL-15 TetraKEs.

IL-15 is the homeostatic regulator of proliferation,
differentiation, activation and survival of NK cells. IL-2
has also been used to improve NK cell performance
against various solid tumors [33, 34]. However cytokine
toxicity led to dose reduction and outcome showed minor
IL-2 related advantages. A study from Munger et al.
used a murine model to show that major side effects of
IL-2 such as capillary leak syndrome were not present
after treatment with IL-15 [35]. Furthermore IL-15
regulates and initiates anti-apoptotic signals in NK cell
effectors and thereby performs proliferation and survival
properties [36]. This has been shown to lead to an increase
of NK cells up to 3-fold and measurable response in

patients with solid tumors [9]. IL-15 effects represent
beneficial characteristics in cancer treatment, which can
be specifically delivered to the effector cells with our
TetraKE.
One potential advantage of delivering IL-15 directly
to the tumor with TetraKE is that systemic exposure
might be avoided reducing toxicity. IL-15 can induce
proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-6, IL-8, TNF-α, IL1β and GM-CSF [37]. This was shown in patient studies
with systemic IL-15 treatment. After IL-15 administration,
acute toxicities such as hemodynamic instability, fever
and chills were reported [9]. Furthermore systemic
administration of IL-15 administration was revealed

to have myelosuppressive properties like induction of
neutropenia and thrombocytopenia [9]. To address the
potential of a critical cytokine release observed in several
immune engagers especially with the IL-15 moiety, IFN-γ,
a critical cytokine associated with toxicity was studied
and evaluated after TetraKE exposure. Results were
encouraging, showing only a moderate IFN-γ induction
compared to the control with supraphysiologic levels
induced by IL-12/IL-18 (data not shown). Similar results
with a moderate cytokine secretion were also seen by

performing a cytokine profile measuring GM-CSF and
TNF-α, which showed enhanced cytokine production
with the TetraKE compared to no treatment but not
significantly more compared to the EpCAM16 BiKE
without the IL-15 moiety. It remains unclear if further
IL-15 related effects such as promotion of proliferation in
patients with lymphoproliferative disease [38] and impact
in angiogenesis, invasion, and hyperplasia [39] can be
induced by the IL-15 moiety. Based on our observations
we believe that the specific delivery to the immunologic

synapse might protect from systemic and unfavorable IL15 effects, which will require clinical testing.
According to the “stem cell model” a small group of
stem cells undergo an asymmetric cell division to either
equal stem cells or to more differentiated progenitor
cells which in turn can provide more differentiated cells
inside the tumor mass. This CSC population expresses
CD133, is chemotherapy- and radiotherapy resistant, and
has tumor initiating and self-renewal abilities [40]. The
critical role of CSC has been reported in solid tumors such
as breast, colon, prostate, liver, pancreatic, lung cancer
and head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC)
[41]. Cancer can be inhibited by eliminating CSC. A
CD133 targeting toxin and a CD133 BiKE which were
constructed with the same CD133 binding site as the
TetraKE showed good response rates in CD133+ bearing
ovarian, gastrointestinal and breast cancer [23, 42–44]
even when the CD133+ population was <10% CD133+
cells. [43]. CD133KDEL, a targeted toxin showed specific
and dose dependent inhibition in human HNSCC cells in
vivo by our group [22]. Importantly, these studies showed
the ability to eliminate tumor initiating cells (e.g. CSC)
in a tumor xenograft model. For this reason, this very
same anti-CD133 scFv was used in the construction of
1615EpCAM133 in this paper. This dual targeting should
provide an enhanced strategy to effectively target the
tumor.
EpCAM is a frequently expressed marker on
carcinoma cells [45] that has impact on patient prognosis
[45]. Thus, it was chosen for our studies. Other immune
engagers have been developed that successfully target
EpCAM and have been tested clinically with some success
validating this target choice. Catumaxomab, is a BiTE
that targets CD3 on T cells and EpCAM. In a randomized
clinical trial, there was a significant decrease in the need
for drainage [46] in patients suffering from EpCAM+ tumor
associated ascites. In some reports, shrinkage of distant
metastasis after therapeutic intraperitoneal administration
occurred [47]. Another bispecific single-chain antibody
construct was created targeting the same epitopes (MT110)
as Catumaxumab. Successful eradication of pancreatic
cancer derived CSC in vitro and in a murine mouse model
was observed [48]. Furthermore Brischwein et al. tested
this construct for efficacy on nine EpCAM bearing cell
lines comprising breast, colon and gastric cancer. All
cell lines were susceptible to redirected lysis [49]. A
deimmunized bispecific targeted toxin (Pseudomonas
enterotoxin) against EpCAM and CD133 showed efficacy
against UMSCC-11B head and neck carcinoma in a
xenograft murine model [23].
EpCAM is commonly expressed on all epithelial
tissues, albeit in lower copy numbers. In order to evaluate
the safety profile, Catumaxumab was tested for toxicity
in a moiety of murine animal models. Side effects were
described with pyrexia, hepatotoxicity, nausea and bone
marrow suppression [50] and might be related to T cell

activation and systemic cytokine release. By harnessing
NK cell effectors to eliminate tumor cells and presenting
IL-15 locally in the immune synapse, we expect to achieve
a better safety profile [4, 6]. However, in vivo experiments
will be required to test this prospectively in a murine
model since human IL-15 cross-reacts with mice.
In conclusion, our work presents a potent TetraKE
with improved dual antigen ADCC. By targeting CD133
and EpCAM simultaneously, our TetraKE addresses
the polygenetic nature of most cancers and enhances
probability to attack cancer at its basal root, the CSC.
Importantly, the addition of IL-15 to the platform induces
effector cell proliferation/activation and prolongs effector
cell survival. With these improvements, we believe that
our drug represents a new generation of NK cell engagers
with improved efficacy in anti-cancer treatment.

Construction of 1615EpCAM133
Synthesis and assembly of hybrid genes encoding
1615EpCAM133 was accomplished using DNA shuffling
and DNA ligation techniques. The fully assembled gene
(from the 5’ end to 3’ end) consisted of an NcoI restriction
site, an ATG initiation codon, the VH and VL regions of
human CD16 (NM3E2) derived from a phage display
library produced by McCall et al. [51], a 20 amino acid
(aa) segment (PSGQAGAAASESLFSNHAY), modified
(N72D) IL-15 [52], a seven aa segment (EASGGPE),
the humanized anti-EPCAM scFv from the antibody
MOC-31, a 15 aa mutated human IgG1 hinge region
(EPKSSDKTHTSPPSP) , the anti-CD133 scFv from clone
7 [53], and finally a NotI restriction site. The resultant
2715 bp NcoI/NotI fragment gene was spliced into the
pET28c expression vector under control of an isopropylβ-D-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) (FischerBiotech, Fair
Lawn, NJ, USA) inducible T7 promoter. DNA sequencing
analysis (Biomedical Genomics Center, University
of Minnesota, MN, USA) was used to verify that the
gene was correct in sequence and had been cloned in
frame. Genes for monospecific anti-CD16 scFv, antiEpCAM scFv, and anti-CD133 scFv were created in the
same manner. Molecular weight was calculated with
“SerialCloner software 2-6-1” according to known amino
acid structure gained from the cloned sequence and was
95,900 Da.

Inclusion body isolation
Bacterial protein expression was performed with
Escherichia coli strain BL21 (DE3) (Novagen, Madison
WI, USA) by plasmid transformation. Bacteria were
cultured in 1000 ml Luria broth containing 30 mg/ml
kanamycin. Gene expression was induced when culture
media reached an OD600 of 0.65 with the addition of
73839

Oncotarget

1 mM IPTG. Three hours after induction bacteria were
harvested (from 4 liters cultured media we isolated 38 g
bacterial pellet). After harvesting the pellet the cell paste
was suspended in 375 ml Lysis buffer solution (50 mM
tris, 50 mM NaCl, and 5 mM EDTA pH 8.0), sonicated
and centrifuged. For pellets extraction they were washed
four times in detergent buffer (1% sodium deoxycholate,
15% Triton X-100, 10% glycerin, 50 mmol/L Tris, 50
mmol/L NaCl, 5 mmol/L EDTA) (pH 8.0) and four in
Lysis buffer.

37°C atmosphere containing 5% CO2. Adherent cells were
passaged by using trypsin-EDTA for detachment when
80-90% confluent. Cells were counted with a standard
hemocytometer and used after showing viability of >95%
in trypan blue staining.

NK cell isolation and purification
To isolate peripheral blood mononuclear cells
(PBMC), a histopaque gradient (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis,
MO, USA) and SepMateTM tubes (Stemcell technologies,
Vancouver, Canada) were used with adult blood (Memorial
Blood Center, Minneapolis, MN, USA) of healthy
volunteers. Samples were obtained after informed consent
and in accordance with the University of Minnesota
human subjects Institutional Review Board and the
Declaration of Helsinki. In case of NK cell purification,
standard magnetic bead enrichment was used according
to the manufacturer's protocol (Stemcell Technologies,
Vancouver, BC, Canada).

Refolding and purification
Refolding and purification was recently described
[4]. In order to refold proteins from inclusion bodies
(IB), the 5 gram pellet of partially purified inclusion
bodies was dissolved into Solubilization buffer (100mM
Tris, 2.5% SLS, pH 10.3) and stirred for 5 hours at room
temperature. CuSO4 was added to the supernatant to
oxidize the protein. 6M urea was added to the oxidized
inclusion bodies and stirred at room temperature for one
hour. 15% AG 1-x8 Resin was added and incubated by
stirring lightly for 20 minutes at room temperature to
remove SLS. The AG 1-x8 Resin was removed by filtering
through 0.45 micron filter. 7 M Guanidine-HCl was added
to the filtered samples and stirred for 2 hours. Sample
was diluted into cold refolding buffer (50mM Tris, 0.5
M L-Arginine, 1M Urea, 20% Glycerin, 50mM NaCl,
5mM EDTA, pH 8.0) and incubated at 4°C for 72 hours.
The refolded 1615EpCAM133 was dialyzed first against
20mM Tris-HCl + 1M Urea then 20mM Tris-HCl without
Urea two times. The 1615EpCAM133 was purified over
FFQ Sepharose anion exchange and Superdex 200 sizing
columns. Using SDS-PAGE we evaluated purity. The
fusion proteins were stained with Simply Blue life Stain
(Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) and size was confirmed
with molecular weight standards.

Flow cytometry based binding and blocking
assay
For the binding assay 4x105 of Caco-2 or HT29 cells were used. After washing, cancer cells were
incubated in 4°C with 200nM Fluorescein isothiocyate
(FITC)-labeled 1615EpCAM133 TetraKE for 30 minutes.
For the blocking 1000 nM of either anti-EpCAM scFv,
anti-CD22-CD19 scFv (anti-CD22 scFv linked to antiCD19 scFv), anti-CD133 scFv or CD133EpCAM (antiCD133 scFv linked to anti-EpCAM scFv) was used. After
washing procedures, staining intensity was evaluated with
the LSRII flow cytometer (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA,
USA).

Procedures were previously reported [5]. Isolated
PBMCs were washed and then incubated overnight (37°C,
5% CO2) in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal
bovine serum. Cells were washed and treated with the
respective concentrations of 1615EpCAM133, EpCAM16,
anti-EpCAM scFv, IL-15 (NCI derived), anti-CD133
scFv and incubated for 10 minutes at 37°C with 5%
CO2. FITC-conjugated anti-human CD107a monoclonal
antibody (mAb) (LAMP-1) (BD biosciences, New Jersey,
CA, USA), was added and further incubated for 1 hour.
GolgiStop (1:1500) (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA, USA)
and GolgiPlug (1:1000) (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA,
USA) were added and cells were further incubated for 3
hours. Cells were washed and stained with the following
mAb from BioLegend, San Diego, CA, USA: PE/Cy7conjugated anti-CD56; APC/Cy 7-conjugated anti-CD16;
PE-CF594-conjugated anti-CD3. After incubation for 30

Cancer cell lines Caco-2a, HT-29b (human colorectal
carcinoma cell lines), SK-BR-3c, BT-474b (breast cancer
cell lines), PC-3b, DU-145a (prostate cancer cell lines),
UMSCC-11Bc (head and neck cancer cell line) and SKOV1d (ovarian cancer cell line) were obtained from American
Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Rockville, MD, USA)
and grown as a monolayer in tissue culture flasks as
published [54, 55]. HL-60b (promyelocytic leukemia
cell line) was also obtained from ATCC and grown
in suspension culture [56]. Media for cell culture was
used as appropriate: aEMEM with 20%, bRPMI, cMEM,
d
DMEM with 10% fetal bovine serum. Additionally to
the preceding supplements, BT-474 media contained 10
μg/mL insulin. All medias were supplemented with 2
mmol/L L-glutamine, 100 μg/mL streptomycin and 100
units/mL penicillin. Cell cultures were incubated in a

Statistical analysis
Data are presented as mean +/- standard deviation.
Differences between groups were analyzed by Student’s t
test or one-way-Anova. Analysis and presentation of data
was done with Graphpad prism 5 (GraphPad Software,
Inc., La Jolla, CA, USA).

Chromium-51 release cytotoxicity assay
Caco-2 and HT-29 target cells were labeled for 1
hour with 1μCi of 51Cr per 1x105 target cells at 37°C,
5% CO2. Washing procedures were performed to remove
excess 51Cr. The labeled target cells were added to the
wells of 96-well round-bottom plates (5x103 cells).
Effectors were treated with 1615EpCAM133 TetraKE or
negative controls and then added to the plates. Effector:
Target (E:T) ratio ranged between 20:1 and 2.2:1. The
amount of 51Cr released, which corresponds to target cell
death, was measured by a gamma scintillation counter,
and the percent target cell lysis was calculated as follows:
[(experimental lysis - spontaneous lysis)/(maximal lysis
- spontaneous lysis)] x 100. To determine maximal lysis,
51
Cr-labeled target cells were treated with 3% Triton X for
4 hours.

GRANT SUPPORT

In order to analyze chemokines and cytokines, we
used purified NK cells from 6 healthy volunteers and
coincubated the cells in 96 well plates for 24 hours with
HT-29 cells at a 2:1 E:T ratio. In addition the respective
drugs were added in a concentration of 50nM. Cells were
stored at 37°C, 5% CO2 and incubated for 24 hours. Then
supernatants were collected and stored at -8o°C until
analysis. GM-CSF, IL-6, IL-8 and TNF-α (R&D Systems,
Minneapolis, MN, USA) levels were determined using the
Luminex system (MAGPIX, Luminex, Austin, TX, USA).
The values, presented in pg/ml, were extrapolated from
standard curves of the recombinant human proteins using
Xponent 4.2 software (Luminex, Austin, TX, USA).
