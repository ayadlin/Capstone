BACKGROUND: Gold (III) compounds have exhibited favorable antitumor properties both in vitro and in
vivo. In a previous study, the authors reported that the novel gold (III) complex 1a (gold 1a) exhibited
strong cytotoxicity in some tumor cell lines. In the current study, the effect of gold 1a was investigated on
colon cancer cells. METHODS: The cytotoxicity of gold 1a was determined by using the 3-(4,5-dimethyl-2thihazyl)-2,5-diphenyl-2H-tetrazolium bromide method. Flow cytometry was used to detect apoptosis and
cell cycle. The expression of protein was evaluated by Western blot assay. Tumor growth in vivo was evaluated in nude mice. RESULTS: Gold 1a exhibited marked cytotoxic effects in vitro to human colon cancer,
and the concentration of drug required to inhibit cell growth by 50% compared with control (IC50) values
ranged from 0.2 lM to 3.4 lM, which represented 8.7-fold to 20.8-fold greater potency than that of cisplatin. Gold 1a significantly induced apoptosis and cell cycle arrest and cleaved caspase 3, caspase 7, and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase; released cytochrome C, and up-regulated p53, p21, p27, and Bax. In vivo,
intraperitoneal injection of gold 1a at doses of 1.5 mg/kg and 3.0 mg/kg significantly inhibited tumor cell
proliferation, induced apoptosis, and suppressed colon cancer tumor growth. An acute toxicology study
indicated that gold 1a at effective antitumor concentrations did not cause any toxic side effects in mice.
CONCLUSIONS: The current results suggested that gold 1a may be a new potential therapeutic drug for coC 2009 American Cancer Society.

Colon cancer is 1 of the leading causes of cancer death in the world. Although early stage colon cancer is
cured with surgery, advanced-stage colon cancer often recurs and becomes fatal, even in patients who
receive combination chemotherapy.1 Cisplatin, which is 1 of the most widely used metal anticancer drugs
with a well understood mechanism of action, has been recognized as 1 of the effective agents against colon
cancer.2 However, cisplatin induces drug resistance, and its side effects still are major limitations to its

clinical use.3 Thus, there is an urgent need for the development of new anticancer drug candidates with cytotoxicity that differs from that of cisplatin and can be
given to patients who respond poorly to cisplatin.
Gold (III) compounds have a long history of medicinal uses, such as treatment for rheumatoid arthritis.4 In
recent years, Gold (III) compounds have received special
attention as promising candidates for new anticancer
drugs.5-7 Gold (III) compounds exhibit strong cytotoxic
activity in vitro against tumor cells and have tumor-inhibiting properties in vivo.8-11 However, currently, some
available gold (III) compounds exhibit poor solubility or
are effective only at relatively high doses.12 We recently
synthesized a series of gold (III) mesotetraarylporphyrins
that are stable against demetallation in physiologic conditions.13 The porphyrin ligands in these compounds can
stabilize the gold (III) center and carry the metal to their
cellular targets. One of these new gold (III) compounds,
gold 1a, exhibits 30-fold to 100-fold stronger cytotoxicity
than cisplatin in several human cancer cell lines, including a cisplatin-resistant human nasopharyngeal carcinoma cell line (CNE-1), and in liver cancer.13-16
Although it has been demonstrated that various gold
(III) compounds have favorable anticancer properties,8-11
their activities against human colon cancer remain to be
studied. Furthermore, the mechanism by which gold (III)
compounds inhibits tumor growth remains largely
unknown.5 In the current study, we explored the antitumor effect of gold 1a and its mechanism against colon
cancer. In this study, we demonstrate that gold 1a exhibits
strong cytotoxicity and induction of apoptosis and inhibits tumor growth in vivo in colon cancer. The results indicate that gold 1a may be a promising chemotherapeutic
drug for patients with colon cancer.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell Lines and Cell Culture
The human colon cancer cell lines SW1116, Colo 205,
CRL-238, CCL-2134, and HCT-15 (American Type
Culture Collection, Rockville, Md) were maintained in
RPMI-1640 medium (GIBCO BRL, Grand Island, NY)
that contained 10% fetal calf serum (GIBCO BRL),
2 mM L-glutamine, 100 U/mL penicillin, and 100 lg/
mL streptomycin (BioWhittaker, Walkersville, Md). All
4460

cell lines were maintained at 37 C in a humidified incubator with an atmosphere of 5% carbon dioxide.
Drugs and the 3-(4,5-Dimethyl-2-Thihazyl)2,5-Diphenyl-2H-Tetrazolium Bromide Assay
Gold 1a was synthesized and purified as described previously and was dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO).13
Cells were treated with different concentrations of drugs
for 72 hours. One hundred microliters of 3-(4,5-dimethyl-2-thihazyl)-2,5-diphenyl-2H-tetrazolium
bromide (MTT) stock solution (1 mg/mL) were added into
each well, and the cells were incubated again at 37 C for
4 hours. Cytotoxicity was measured by using the MTT
assay.17 The ratio of absorbance in the treated cells relative
to that in the control cells was calculated and is expressed
as the percentage of cell death.
40 -6-Diamidino-2-Phenylindole Staining
Cells were fixed with 4% formalin/phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), stained with 10 lg/mL 40 -6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (Sigma Chemical Company, St. Louis, Mo),
and observed under a Zeiss Axioscope fluorescence microscope. Cells that revealed cytoplasmic and nuclear shrinkage, chromatin condensation, or nuclear fragmentation
were defined as apoptotic cells. In the determination of
the apoptotic index and to evaluate the appearance of
aberrant nuclei, 300 cells per field were counted.
Flow Cytometry
Cells were collected, fixed with ice-cold 70% ethanol in
PBS. then incubated with 100 lL of RNase I (1 mg/mL)
and 100 lL of propidium iodide (400 lg/mL) at 37 C
for 30 minutes. Samples were analyzed by flow cytometry
(Coulter, Luton, United Kingdom). The cell-cycle phase
distribution was determined from a resultant DNA histogram using Multicycle AV software (Phoenix Flow Systems, San Diego, Calif).
Western Blot Analysis
Cells were lysed with lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH
7.5; 250 mM NaCl; 0.1% NP40; and 5 mM ethylene
glycol tetraacetic acid containing 50 mM sodium fluoride, 60 mM b-glycerol-phosphate, 0.5 mM sodium
vanadate, and 0.1 mM phenyl methyl sulfonyl fluoride).

Protein samples were electrophoresed in a 10% denaturing sodium dodecyl sulfate gel and transferred to Immobilon-P membranes (Millipore, Bedford, Mass). The
blots were incubated with different primary antibodies,
reacted with a peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody
(Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, Calif), and
finally observed by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham, Piscataway, NJ).
Terminal DeoxynucleotidyltransferaseMediated Deoxyuridine TriphosphateDigoxigenin Nick-End Labeling Assay
Tumor xenografts were excised and fixed in formalin immediately after resection. Terminal deoxynucleotidyl
transferase-mediated deoxyuridine triphosphate-digoxigenin nick-end labeling was carried out using the In ApoAlert DNA Fragmentation Assay Kit (Clontech
Corporation, Palo Alto, Calif).17 Apoptotic cells exhibited strong, green nuclear fluorescence.
The percentage of apoptotic cells was assessed in 10
randomly selected fields and was viewed at 40 magnification. The apoptotic index was calculated as the number of
apoptotic cells/total number of nucleated cells  100%.
Immunohistochemistry
The expression of Ki-67 in tumor tissues was detected with
the Dako LSABþ Kit (Dako, Carpenteria, Calif) according to manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, slides were
boiled in 10 mM citrate buffer (pH 6.0) (Bio Genex, San
Ramon, Calif), for antigen retrieval. Then, the sections
were incubated with anti-Ki-67 antibody (1:100 dilution;
Dako) followed by biotinylated anti-immunoglobulin G
antibody and StreptAB-complex/HRP (Dako). Sections
were counterstained with hematoxylin and were evaluated
independently by 2 investigators. Ki-67 staining was
recorded as the ratio of positively stained cells to all tumor
cells in 5 areas at 200-fold magnification.

mor size was determined by measuring the 2 greatest perpendicular dimensions with a caliper every 3 days. When
tumor size reached to 80 mm3 to 100 mm3, the mice were
divided and treated with 1 of the following: no treatment,
gold 1a (1.5 mg/kg or 3 mg/kg once per week for 3 weeks
intraperitoneally) and cisplatin (3 mg/kg once per week
for 3 weeks intraperitoneally; Pharmacia & Upjohn Inc.,
Bridgewater, NJ). Tumor volume was estimated by using
the equation V ¼ 4/3p  a/2  (b/2)2, where a was the
greatest dimension, and b was the perpendicular dimension.18 All experiments included 4 or 5 mice per group,
and each was repeated 3 times. The percentage inhibition
was calculated as (1  [mean size of tumor tests/mean sizes
of tumor controls])  100%.
Acute Toxicity Test
The test was conducted at the Center for Drug Safety
Evaluation and Research (Shanghai Institute of Materia
Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai, China).
Seventy mice from an imprinting control region (ICR)
strain (35 males and 35 females; weight, 18 g to 22 g)
were chosen and divided into 6 groups for single intraperitoneal injections of gold 1a at doses of 3.0 mg/kg, 3.2 mg/
kg, 4.0 mg/kg, 5.0 mg/kg, and 6.0 mg/kg, and a vehicle
control also was included. The health status of the mice
was observed for 14 days after injection. On Day 15, all
mice were killed, and different organs, including the
heart, lung, liver, kidney, intestine, spleen, stomach,
testes, and ovaries, were examined.
Statistical Analysis
The mean and standard error were calculated from the raw
data and then subjected to the Student t test. P values <.05
were regarded as statistically significant. The Kaplan-Meier
method was used to analyze the survival of mice injected at
different doses of gold 1a in an acute toxicity experiment.

RESULTS
Effect of Gold 1a on Tumor Growth In Vivo
Female Balb/C nude mice ages 5 weeks to 6 weeks were
obtained from the Animal Laboratory Unit at the University of Hong Kong (Hong Kong, China). Tumors were
established by the subcutaneous injection of 1  106 Colo
205 cells/0.2 mL PBS into the left flank of the mice. TuCancer

drug required to inhibit cell growth by 50% compared
with control [IC50 values]) were evaluated from the dose
dependence of surviving cells 48 hour after exposure to
gold 1a and cisplatin (as a positive control). Gold 1a demonstrated significant cytotoxic activity with IC50 values
that ranged from 0.20 lM to 3.4 lM. The anticancer potency of gold 1a was much higher than that of cisplatin.
The IC50 of gold 1a was 8.7-fold to 20.8-fold lower than
that of cisplatin. Furthermore, gold (III) exhibited 9-fold
greater cytotoxicity in the multidrug-resistant cell line
HCT-15A compared with cisplatin (Table 1).
Gold 1a Induces Apoptosis in Colon Cancer
Cells
Treatment with gold 1a (1 lM and 3 lM) induced
marked morphologic changes, including cytoplasmic
vacuoles in HCT-15 cells (Fig. 1A) and cellular fragmentation and nuclear shrinkage 24 hours and 48 hours after
treatment (Fig. 1B). There was a significant increase in
the percentage of apoptotic cells (Fig. 1B). Treatment
with cisplatin (3 lM) induced similar morphologic
changes (Figs. 1A and 1B). Similar changes were observed
in Colo 205 colon cancer cells that were treated with gold
1a and cisplatin (data not shown). Quantitative analysis
indicated that the percentage of apoptotic cells was significantly higher in the gold 1a-treated mice than in the cisplatin-treated and DMSO-treated (control) mice (Fig.
1C). We also detected apoptosis by using fluorescence4462

activated cell sorter analysis. Gold 1a induced apoptosis in
a dose-dependent manner in colon cancer cells. The frequency of cells at sub-G1 phase in HCT-15 cells that were
treated with 1 lM and 3 lM gold 1a for 48 hours was
11% and 37.2%, respectively, compared with the control
group (4.5%) (Fig. 2A). Twenty percent to 45% of cells
were undergoing apoptotic cell death when they were
treated with 3 lM gold 1a for 48 hours in 4 colon cancer
cell lines that we examined (Fig. 2B). Moreover, the effect
of gold 1a on apoptosis was stronger than that of cisplatin
(Fig. 2B). Treatment with gold 1a consistently resulted in
the expression of several markers of apoptosis, such as caspase 3, caspase 7, and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase
(PARP) cleavage, and in the release of mitochondrial cytochrome C into the cytosol (Fig. 2C). Overall, these results
confirmed the proapoptotic activity of gold 1a in vitro.
Gold 1a Causes Cell Cycle Arrest in
G0/G1 Phase
When HCT-15 cells were treated with 1 lM gold 1a for
48 hours, the frequency of cells in G0/G1 phase (56.1%)
was increased compared with that in the control group
(44.2%), indicating a significant increase in the number
of apoptotic cells (sub-G1 cells, 11%) compared with the
control group (4.5%) (Fig. 2A). To avoid the effect of
dead cells on cell cycle phase, we treated HCT-15 cell at a
low dose of gold 1a (0.1 lM) to reduce the induction of
cell death; however, significant inhibition of cell proliferation was retained (data not shown). When HCT-15 cells
were treated with 0.1 lM gold 1a, the number of cells in
G0/G1 phases began to increase at 12 hours and was more
significant at 24 hours, 48 hours, 72 hours, and 96 hours
after treatment. The results from a typical experiment are
shown in Figure 3A. Similar results were observed in Colo
205 cells (data not shown). These data indicated that gold
1a induces cell cycle arrest, resulting in the inhibition of
cancer cell growth. In additional, the reduced cell growth
also may be attributable to the apoptotic cell death
observed with high doses of gold 1a (Fig. 2A).
Gold 1a Induces Expression of Cell CycleRelated and Apoptosis-Related Protein
Western blot analysis indicated that gold 1a up-regulated
the expression of p21WAF1/CIP1, p27KIP1, and Bax proteins in HCT-15 cells and decreased the expression of

Gold 1a Inhibits Tumor Growth In Vivo
We investigated the in vivo effect of gold 1a on established
subcutaneous tumors. Because Colo 205 cells have stronger capacity for tumorigenesis, we chose them for in vivo
study. Figure 4A indicates that gold 1a (1.5 mg/kg per
Cancer

week and 3.0 mg/kg once per week for 3 weeks) significantly inhibited the growth of tumor xenografts compared with the control group. The antitumor efficiency
of gold 1a was similar or better than that of the clinically
used cisplatin (Fig. 4A). The hematoxylin and eosin
staining revealed that mice that received gold 1a and cisplatin treatment exhibited larger areas of dead cells in the
tumor tissue compared with mice in the control group
(data not shown). Consistent with the in vitro results,

the proportion of Ki-67-positive cells in tumors that
were treated with gold 1a (5.3%  1.3%) was slightly
lower than the proportion in tumors that were treated
with cisplatin (6.7%  1.2%; P > 0.05) and significantly lower than the proportion in DMSO-treated
tumors (18.9%  2.4%; P < .01) (Fig. 4B,C). It is noteworthy that tumors treated with gold 1a had a higher
percentage of apoptotic cells (22.7%  2.9%) than the
percentage in DMSO-treated tumors (3.2%  0.6%; P
< .01) was similar to the percentage in cisplatin-treated
tumors (18.7%  2.5%; P >.05) (Fig. 4B,C). These
results suggest that the inhibition of tumor growth is
caused by an increase in apoptosis and a decrease in cell
proliferation induced by gold 1a in vivo.
Gold 1a At its Effective In Vivo
Concentration Demonstrates Low Toxicity
Finally, we evaluated the safety of gold 1a in vivo. We did
not observe any histologic changes in major organs,
including the heart, lung, liver, kidney, intestine, spleen,
stomach, testes, or ovaries, in mice that were treated with
gold 1a (data not shown). We also evaluated the acute toxicity of gold 1a at serial doses 3.0 mg/kg (ie, 3.0 mg/kg,
3.2 mg/kg, 4.0 mg/kg, 5.0 mg/kg, and 6.25 mg/kg) (Fig.
5A,B). All mice survived during the observation period of
14 days with treatment of gold 1a at 3.0 mg/kg. However,
3 of 10 mice died after treatment of gold 1a for 8 to
10 days at a dose of 3.2 mg/kg. Increasing doses of gold 1a
to 4.0 mg/kg, 5.0 mg/kg, and 6.25 mg/kg decreased body
weight and increased the death rate of the treated mice.
The 50% lethal dose value of gold 1a derived from these
curves was identified as 4.4 mg/kg. After a single intraperitoneal injection of gold 1a, the body weight of mice
decreased gradually after 2 days. For the mice that survived, their body weight was regained 5 days to 7 days after treatment. At the end of the observation period (Day
14), the dead or killed (at Day 15) mice were dissected
and underwent histologic assessment of organ damage.
No obvious damage in the major organs was observed.
The results suggested that gold 1a exhibits low toxicity in
vivo at its effective concentration.

the reported cytotoxic gold (III) complexes are unstable in
physiologic conditions19 and have marginal or moderate
in vivo antitumor activity against human carcinoma xenografts.6,12,20 An organogold (III) complex (2-[dimethylaminomethyl] phenyl phenyl gold [III] chloride) exhibits
promising in vitro cytotoxicity in colon cancer cells, but it
fails to inhibit in vivo tumor growth in HT-29 colon cancer xenografts.21 In the current study, we observed that
gold 1a exhibited significant cytotoxicity against different
colon cell lines with 8.7-fold to 20.8-fold greater higher
potency than that of cisplatin. Furthermore, gold 1a
4467

Original Article

displayed stronger cytotoxicity to multidrug-resistant colon cancer than cisplatin. More noteworthy, for the first
time to our knowledge, we observed that gold 1a effectively inhibited colon tumor growth in vivo. These data
reveal that gold 1a is a potent cytotoxic agent against colon cancer.
The mechanisms responsible for gold (III) complex
antitumor activity still are largely unknown. It is believed
generally that the cytotoxic effects of metal complexes are
the consequences of direct damage to nuclear
DNA.13,22,23 However, some studies have demonstrated
that gold (III) complex interactions with DNA are not as
tight as platinum interactoins.6,24 Gold (III) compounds
inhibit DNA and RNA synthesis and have only minimal
cross-resistance to cisplatin,25 suggesting a different mechanism of action. Recent data suggest that the induction of
apoptosis is a major mechanism of gold 1a.14,15,21 Our
result indicated that gold 1a exhibits strong induction of
apoptosis in colon cancer by cleaving caspase 3, caspase 7,
and PARP; releasing cytochrome C, and up-regulating
Bax, suggesting that gold 1a induces apoptosis by a mitochondrial death pathway. The result is consistent with a
recent report that gold 1a can induce apoptosis in nasopharyngeal cancer cell through a mitochondrial death
pathway related to reactive oxygen species.14 Microarray
data revealed that gold 1a can up-regulate several genes
that are involved in the induction of apoptosis.15 Furthermore, we observed that gold 1a up-regulated the expression of p53, p27, p21, and Bax proteins in HCT-15 cells
and decreased the expression of bcl-xl, whereas there was
no change in the levels of bcl-2 or Bak protein. It is noteworthy that the up-regulation of p53 and p27 protein
began to rise 12 hours after treatment, indicating that p53
and p21 may mediate the early apoptosis event induced
by gold 1a. These data suggest that gold 1a can induce apoptosis by regulating the expression of apoptosis-related
genes p53, p21, p27, and Bax.
Cell cycle checkpoints maintain genomic stability in
eukaryotes in response to genotoxic stress. The induction
of the cell cycle is a major mechanism of chemotherapeutic drugs and plays an important role in the antitumor activity of such drugs. It was reported that cisplatin caused
G2/M cell cycle arrest and inhibition of DNA synthesis in
a panel of human cancer cell lines.26 One study demonstrated that organogold (III) compounds II and III can
increase cell numbers in G2/M phase among ovarian can4468

cer cells, similar to the action of cisplatin, while organogold (III) compound I caused cell cycle arrest in G0/G1
phase.27 In the current study, we observed that gold 1a
caused cell cycle arrest in colon cancer cells in G0/G1
phase. Our results are consistent with data indicating that
gold 1a treatment decreased cell numbers at G2/M phase
and increased cell numbers at G0/G1 phase.16 Therefore,
gold 1a-induced cell cycle arrest is different from that
induced by cisplatin, although recent data also demonstrated that G1 arrest induction represents a critical determinant for cisplatin in G1 checkpoint-retaining human
cancer.28 Furthermore, we observed that the up-regulation of p53, p21, and Bax began 12 hour after treatment,
consistent with the time point of G0/G1phase arrest. The
expression of p53 and p21 may play an early role in cell
cycle arrest. The up-regulation of Bax and p27 began at
48 hours after treatment; at that time, the expression of
p53 decreased, and p53, p21, and p27 played a pivotal
role in cell cycle arrest and apoptosis.29-32 Another study
indicated that p53 provokes cell cycle arrest in G0/G1
phase by up-regulating p21 and Bax.33 In the current
study, p27 up-regulation may maintain cell cycle arrest
and apoptosis in gold 1a-treated cells at a late treatment
stage. Thus, our results have demonstrated a new mechanism by which gold 1a induced apoptosis and caused cell
cycle arrest through the regulation of p53, p27, p21, and
Bax.
In summary, gold 1a effectively inhibits cell proliferation, induces apoptosis, and inhibits tumor growth in colon cancer. Given the poor long-term survival and
prospects for patients who have late-stage colon cancer
and the lack of successful treatments at this stage, this
highly effective gold 1a can provide crucial insights into
the anticancer mechanism of colon cancer.
