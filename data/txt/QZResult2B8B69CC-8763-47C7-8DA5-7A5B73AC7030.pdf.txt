BACKGROUND. In this international, multicenter trial, the authors evaluated rituximab (anti-CD20) plus epratuzumab (anti-CD22) in patients with postchemotherapy relapsed/refractory, indolent non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), including longterm efficacy.

METHODS. Forty-nine patients with follicular NHL (FL) (N 5 41) or small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL) (N 5 7) received intravenous epratuzumab 360 mg/m2
and then intravenous rituximab 375 mg/m2 weekly 34. The regimen was tolerated well.

RESULTS. Twenty-two of 41 patients with FL (54%) had an objective response

lthough the non-Hodgkin lymphomas (NHLs)
are a diverse collection of diseases,1 most
express common B-cell antigens. In 1997, the antiCD20 monoclonal antibody rituximab (Rituxan; Genentech, South San Francisco, Calif; Biogen Idec Pharmaceuticals, San Diego, Calif) was approved for the
treatment of patients with relapsed or refractory,
low-grade or follicular, CD20-positive, B-cell NHL after a pivotal trial in which 375 mg/m2 rituximab
administered once weekly for 4 consecutive weeks
resulted in a 48% overall response rate (6% complete
responses [CRs]).2 Other B-cell antigens also provide
promising targets, including CD22, a 135-kD glycoprotein that is expressed on the cell surface of
mature B cells in follicular NHL (FL) and other NHL
subtypes, with expression that ceases when B-cells
differentiate into plasma cells.3,4 A recent summary
indicted that CD22 may act to regulate B-lymphocyte
survival, mediate adhesion and signal transduction,
and regulate B-cell receptor (BCR) activation.5 Initially, an anti-CD22 mouse monoclonal antibody
(mLL2; formerly EPB-2) was developed and characterized that had promising in vitro properties.6,7
Thus, epratuzumab, the resulting humanized monoclonal antibody (hLL2), which has 90% to 95%
human origin, greatly reduced the potential for immunogenicity.8 In vitro experiments demonstrated
that the antitumor activity of epratuzumab was predominantly by antibody-dependent cytotoxicity,9,10
and in vivo studies in animals demonstrated that
combined therapy with epratuzumab and rituximab
or with another CD20 antibody, veltuzumab (hA20),
was more effective in controlling lymphoma growth
and prolonging survival than either agent alone.10,11
Other in vitro studies have suggested a mechanism
of action different from rituximab, possibly also
involving a different signaling pathway in the inhibition of proliferation of CD22-positive malignant B
cells.12
In initial clinical studies, patients with indolent
and aggressive NHL received increasing doses of
epratuzumab administered weekly for 4 consecutive
weeks.13,14 Epratuzumab was tolerated well, no doselimiting toxicity was observed for doses administered

up to 1000 mg/m2, and most infusions were administered within 1 hour. Epratuzumab showed activity
as a single agent, particularly in FL, with a 43%
objective response (OR) rate in 14 patients who
received 360 mg/m2 for 4 weeks. Therefore, this dose
was selected for further development and has been
employed in follow-up trials, including the current
study. However, because rituximab and epratuzumab
target different antigens, combining epratuzumab
with rituximab could result in higher antitumor activity compared with rituximab alone. On the basis
of a small, single-center pilot study indicating that
the combination of rituximab with epratuzumab had
high activity in both indolent and aggressive NHL,15
the current international multicenter trial was
designed to determine the safety and efficacy of
epratuzumab in combination with rituximab for
patients with low-grade, CD20-positive B-cell NHL
with disease that progressed after (ie, refractory or
relapsed) at least 1 prior regimen of standard chemotherapy for NHL.16,17 Here, we report the final study
results, including long-term follow-up, demonstrating
durable responses that, in some patients, continued
for >4 years.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
This open-label, single-arm, multicenter phase 2
study was conducted to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of epratuzumab in combination with rituximab for the treatment of patients with refractory or
recurrent, indolent NHL. The study endpoints were
safety, efficacy (OR and CR rates, duration of
response, time to progression), immunogenicity, and
pharmacokinetics. At each participating institution,
the governing ethics committee approved the study,
and written informed consent was obtained from all
patients.

Patient Population
Patients aged 18 years were eligible if they had indolent, CD20-positive, B-cell NHL based on local diagnosis and had failed at least 1 prior regimen of
standard chemotherapy for NHL. Patients who were

2716

CANCER

November 15, 2008 / Volume 113 / Number 10

rituximab-naive and those who had received rituximab as single agent or in combination with chemotherapy as their last treatment and who
demonstrated a partial response (PR) or CR with a
time to progression 12 months were eligible.
Included patients had bidimensionally measurable
disease demonstrated on a computed tomography
(CT) scan with a least 1 lesion 1.5 cm in greatest
dimension, an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group
(ECOG) performance status 1, and a minimal life
expectancy of 4 months. Patients who had disease
that was refractory to rituximab (ie, who did not
meet the criteria described above) or who had
received prior antibody therapy for lymphoma other
than rituximab were ineligible; also ineligible were
patients with primary or secondary central nervous
system lymphoma, known or suspected transformed
lymphoma, pleural effusions with positive cytology
for lymphoma, or prior radiation therapy to the index
lesion(s), unless lesions clearly were progressing or
were positive on gallium scans. Other exclusion criteria included evidence of rapid disease progression or
symptoms that required intervention within 2 weeks
of starting therapy; another primary malignancy
within 3 years (other than squamous or basal cell
skin cancer, cervical cancer in situ, or stage I prostate
cancer); known human antichimeric antibody
(HACA) or human antihuman antibody (HAHA) positivity or positive for hepatitis B surface antigen, hepatitis C virus, or human immunodeficiency virus
(HIV); known type-1 hypersensitivity or anaphylactic
reactions to murine proteins; major surgery within 4
weeks (unless fully recovered); other investigational
agents within 30 days; pregnant or breastfeeding; refusal to use adequate contraception precautions;
unavailable for follow-up assessment; or any serious
nonmalignant condition or infection that likely
would compromise patient safety.

Treatment
The epratuzumab/rituximab combination was given
on a weekly basis for 4 consecutive weeks, with an
intravenous infusion of 360 mg/m2 epratuzumab
given first within 1 hour followed at least 1 hour later
(but within 24 hours) by a 375 mg/m2 dose of rituximab administered intravenously. All patients were
premedicated each week with antihistamines and
antipyretics, but steroids were not prescribed routinely.
Safety and Laboratory Tests
At study entry, the most recent pathology specimen
obtained from each patient was submitted for central
NHL histology review. Formalin-fixed, paraffin-em-

bedded tumor sample evaluations by an independent
pathologist also included determining positive CD20
and CD22 status using commercially available antiCD20 and anti-CD22 antibodies. Patients were monitored for adverse reactions during infusions, with
vital signs obtained every 15 minutes until both infusions were complete, and then 30 minutes and
60 minutes later. Patients continued to be monitored
for safety at 4 weeks after the last infusion and then
every 3 months for at least 1 year. Adverse events
(AEs) were classified according to the MedDRA system organ class and preferred term, whereas toxicity
grading of AEs and laboratory tests used National
Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria, version
2.0. Blood samples for routine safety laboratory tests
(serum chemistry, hematology), B-cell counts (CD19positive), and immunoglobulin (Ig) levels were
obtained before each infusion, 4 weeks after the last
infusion, and then every 3 months as needed at follow-up evaluations. Serum samples to determine
epratuzumab and rituximab levels were obtained at
the time of these evaluations and also 10 minutes after each infusion, and some patients who participated in an optional full pharmacokinetics study had
additional samples taken after the first and last infusions. Serum samples for determining immunogenicity (HAHA/HACA) were obtained at baseline, before
the last infusion, 4 weeks later, and then during follow-up until the samples were negative. Epratuzumab levels and HAHA determinations were
performed by the sponsor using an enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assay.

Response Evaluation
All patients underwent physical examination and had
CT scans obtained of the neck, chest, abdomen, pelvis, and other sites of known disease at baseline, at 4
weeks after the last infusion, and every 3 months
thereafter either until the occurrence of disease progression or the initiation of additional therapy. A
bone marrow biopsy was required at baseline and, in
patients who had bone marrow infiltration, only if
needed to confirm a CR. Treatment responses were
classified by each investigator using International
Workshop Criteria,18 with each patient’s best
response classified as either a CR, an unconfirmed
CR (CRu), a PR, stable disease (SD), or progressive
disease (PD).
Statistical Analysis
Descriptive statistics were used to summarize demographics, safety and laboratory data, and treatment
response rates. Progression-free survival (PFS),
defined as the duration from the first day of study

Epratuzumab and Rituximab in NHL/Leonard et al

drug administration to the day of disease progression
(based on physical or radiologic [CT] evidence),
death, or last contact, whichever occurred earliest,
was analyzed by using the Kaplan-Meier productlimit method. Duration of response (DR), defined as
the duration from the first day of onset of an OR, ie,
CR, CRu, or PR, to the day of disease progression,
death, or last contact, whichever occurred earliest,
was summarized using similar methods. Secondary
analyses using similar statistical methods also were
performed to evaluate the effects of several covariates, including prior treatment with rituximab, bone
marrow involvement, and Follicular Lymphoma
International Prognostic Index (FLIPI) risk score.19
The Fisher exact test was used to analyze for significant differences in the OR rates according to the

from zero to 5 according to published criteria,19 with
13 patients (32%) considered low risk0-1 and 28
patients (68%) considered intermediate to high risk
(2) for a poor outcome. Demographics and patient
characteristics are summarized in Table 1.

Study Drug Administration
Forty-nine patients completed all 4 scheduled infusions of epratuzumab, whereas 48 patients received
all 4 rituximab infusions. One patient who had infusion reactions during the first rituximab infusion prematurely discontinued that infusion and continued
to receive epratuzumab infusions without further
rituximab infusions. For epratuzumab, the median
infusion time for each infusion was 1.0 to 1.1 hours
(range, 0.3-2.3 hours); and, for rituximab, the median
infusion time was 4.4 hours for the first infusion and
3.1 to 3.2 hours for subsequent infusions (range, 1.56.8 hours).

RESULTS
Patient Characteristics and Demographics
In total, 49 patients (26 men, 23 women; median age,
61 years) were enrolled at 18 institutions in the
United States, Australia, and Canada between September 2001 and February 2003. They were a median
of 4 years from their initial diagnosis, and most
patients had a good performance status (78% ECOG
0) at study entry but had widespread disease (69%
stage III/IV). All patients had received at least 1 prior
chemotherapy treatment (range, 1-8 prior treatments), and most patients were rituximab-naive:
Only 14 patients (29%) had received 1 prior rituximab-containing regimen. Twenty-four patients (49%)
had positive bone marrow involvement at study
entry, and 7 patients (14%) had elevated lactate
dehydrogenase.
On the basis of the World Health Organization
classification,20 all patients initially had locally determined diagnostic classifications of indolent NHL: either grade 1 or 2 lymphoma (FL) or small
lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL). The central histology
review confirmed the original indolent FL or SLL histology in 42 patients and reclassified the histology in
4 patients (2 SLL were reclassified as FL, 1 FL was
reclassified as SLL, and 1 FL was reclassified as
aggressive NHL with findings of both FL and diffuse
large B-cell lymphoma [DLBCL]). The review was
inconclusive regarding the other 3 patients (2 FL, 1
SLL), so they remained characterized by their original
diagnostic classification. Thus, 48 patients maintained their classification of indolent NHL (41 FL, 7
SLL), whereas 1 patient was reclassified with aggressive lymphoma (FL and DLBCL). For the 41 patients
who had FL, FLIPI scores were assigned on a scale

Efficacy
Of the 48 patients with indolent NHL (41 FL, 7 SLL),
6 patients had disease progression at the first evaluation 4 weeks after the last infusion and underwent
no further response evaluation, whereas the other
patients continued scheduled evaluations until disease progression. On the basis of the best response
(12 CR, 1 CRu, 13 PR, 16 SD, 6 PD), 26 patients had
an OR (OR 5 CR 1 CRu 1 PR). For these 26 patients,
the median time from first infusion to onset of an
OR was 1.7 months (range, 1.4-10.8 months), and the
median time to onset of their best response was
4.2 months (range 1.4-22.4, months). Among the
41 patients with FL, 22 patients (54%) had an OR,
including 10 (24%) CRs (CR/CRu), and 4 of 7 patients
with SLL (57%) had ORs, including 3 (42.9%) CRs
(CR/Cru). The 34 rituximab-naive patients with FL
and SLL had an OR rate of 50% (26% CR/CRu) compared with 64.3% (28.6%) for 14 patients who
received prior rituximab, whereas 22 patients without
bone marrow involvement had an OR (CR/CRu) rate
of 63.6% (40.9%) compared with 45.8% (16.7%) for
24 patients with bone marrow spread. Thirteen lowrisk patients with FL (FLIPI score, 0-1) had an 85%
OR rate (43% CR/CRu), whereas 28 patients with intermediate- to high-risk FL (FLIPI 2) had a 39% OR
rate (18% CR/CRu): This difference in OR rates
achieved statistical significance (P 5 .009). Table 2
summarizes these efficacy results for the 48 patients
who had indolent NHL. The single patient who was
evaluated by independent histology review and was
diagnosed with a more aggressive histology achieved
a PR 4 weeks after treatment, and had disease progression at the next evaluation 1 month later.

The 48 patients with indolent NHL were followed
for a median of 11.1 months (range, 1.5-52.3
months). Figure 1 depicts the Kaplan-Meier estimated survival curves for PFS and DR in the FL and
SLL patient subgroups. The 41 patients with FL had

a median PFS of 10 months, and the 22 patients with
FL who had an OR had a median DR of 13.4 months.
In addition, the 10 patients with FL who achieved
CR/CRu had durable responses with a median DR of
29.1 months, and 4 patients remained in remission
at the last evaluation, including patients with
responses that currently have continued for >4 years.
The 7 patients with SLL had a median PFS of 20
months, and the 4 patients with SLL who had an
OR had a median DR of 20.3 months, including 1
patient with a response that currently has continued
for >3 years.

Adverse Events
None of the 49 patients discontinued the study because
of AEs. Two patients died approximately 6 months after
treatment, both attributed to progression of disease. The
other 47 patients continued on study for at least 1 year, as
required by protocol for safety monitoring. Three other
deaths occurred during subsequent follow-up: 2 were
attributed to disease progression and the third was attributed to interstitial pneumonia after high-dose chemotherapy for disease progression.
Without regard to attribution, 43 of 49 patients
(88%) had at least 1 AE during the study, and the

most frequently reported (10% of patients) were
rigors (43%), nausea (25%), pyrexia (25%), fatigue
(22%), vomiting (22%), headache (20%), cough (16%),
dyspnea (16%), flushing (10%), and sinusitis (10%).
Most AEs were mild-moderate (grade 1-2) events,
and only 7 patients had events of greater severity
(grade 3), including asymptomatic neutropenia
(laboratory finding at 1 evaluation only and without
clinical event), cervical lymphadenitis (swollen malignant lymph node during treatment requiring hospitalization for intravenous antibiotics), peripheral/
scrotal edema (unrelated worsening of grade 2 baseline condition), febrile neutropenia (6 weeks after
treatment requiring hospitalization for intravenous
antibiotics and granulocyte-colony-stimulating factor
[G-CSF]), tachycardia, and tachypnea (infusion reactions during first rituximab infusion), cholecystitis
(unrelated event 10 weeks after treatment), and cardiopulmonary arrest (because of progression of disease 7 months after treatment).
AEs that were considered likely or suspected to
be caused by epratuzumab occurred in 24 of 49
patients (49%), and the most frequent (10%) were
rigors (18%), nausea (14%), fatigue (12%), vomiting
(12%), and headache (10%). Most were infusion reactions that occurred predominantly at first infusion,
with 5 patients having such events at each of the
subsequent infusions. In addition, these were predominantly grade 1 and 2 AEs, and only 3 grade 3

2719

events were described previously (asymptomatic
neutropenia, cervical lymphadenitis, febrile neutropenia), and they were considered possibly study drug
related.
Four AEs were reported as serious AEs (SAEs),
including the 3 grade 3 events described above
(cervical lymphadenitis, febrile neutropenia, cardiopulmonary arrest). The remaining SAE occurred in a
patient who received fludarabine and cyclophosphamide after disease progression occurred 8 weeks after
treatment; 4 weeks later, the patient developed disseminated herpes zoster attributed to neutropenia
from the chemotherapy and was hospitalized for intravenous antivirals and GM-CSF.
Seventeen of 49 patients (35%) had 1 or more
infections, including 5 upper and 1 lower respiratory
tract infections, 5 sinus and 3 nasopharynx infections, 2 dental abscesses, 2 herpes zoster and 2 herpes simplex infections, 1 catheter site infection, and
1 cervical lymphadenitis. Of these, 3 patients had 5
infections that were considered possibly study drug
related (upper and lower respiratory tract infections,
sinusitis, herpes simplex, cervical lymphadenitis), 2
infections (herpes zoster, cervical lymphadenitis)
were SAEs, and 3 infections (dental abscess, herpes
zoster, cervical lymphadenitis) required treatment
with intravenous antibiotics/antivirals.

Routine Laboratory Tests
Blood samples for standard laboratory safety tests
(serum chemistry, hematology), were obtained before
each infusion, 4 weeks after the last infusion, and every 3 months thereafter as needed at follow-up evaluations. Postbaseline increases in toxicity grades
according to National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria version 2.0 were infrequent and were
limited predominantly to grade 1 and 2 events (Table 3).
There were no grade 4 cytopenias, only 4 patients
developed grade 3 cytopenias (2 lymphopenias, 1
neutropenia, 1 leukopenia), and no patients developed grade 3 or 4 renal or hepatic abnormalities.
Pharmacokinetics
Samples for the determination of serum epratuzumab and rituximab concentrations were collected at
baseline, just before each infusion, within 10 minutes
after the completion of each infusion, 4 weeks after
the last treatment, and at 3 months, 6 months, 9
months, and 12 months thereafter. Maximum epratuzumab and rituximab serum concentrations (mean 
standard deviation), respectively, were 194  56 lg/
mL and 187  39 lg/mL after completing the first
infusion and 322  89 lg/mL and 327  97 lg/mL
after the fourth infusion. A subset of patients had

optional additional samples collected at 24 hours,
48 hours, 72 hours, and 120 hours after the first and
fourth infusions and 336 hours after the fourth infusion. After the fourth infusion, the resulting serum
terminal-phase half-lives (mean  standard deviation) for epratuzumab and rituximab were 22.7  7.2
days and 31.7  7.8 days, respectively. These results,
as reported previously in abstract form,21,22 were
comparable to the values determined previously
when epratuzumab and rituximab were administered
as single agents and, thus, were not affected when
the 2 antibodies were administered in combination.
Consistent with data reported in the literature,2
median serum levels of rituximab were higher in
responders than nonresponders, and the difference
achieved statistical significance in this study before
each infusion as well as at 4 weeks and 3 months after the last infusion. For epratuzumab, differences in
median serum levels were not apparent between
responders and nonresponders at most time points,
except at 4 weeks and 3 months after last infusion,
when responders had statistically significantly higher
values compared with nonresponders.

B-Cell and Immunologic Changes
The independent pathology assessment of submitted
pathology samples determined that all patients in
this study had tissue samples that were both CD20negative and CD22-positive. These results were part
of a larger assessment in B-cell NHL histologies
demonstrating that 99% of all indolent NHL samples
tested were CD22-positive.3
Blood samples for determination of B-cell levels
(CD19) were collected at baseline, before each infusion, at 4 weeks after the last infusion, and at 3-

month intervals thereafter until recovery to baseline.
Median B-cell levels decreased 95% from baseline after the first infusion and after therapy, and most
patients (44) continued to have samples obtained
until at least 4 months after the last infusion
(approximately 5 months after baseline) and, in 35
patients, 7 months after last infusion (approximately
8 months after baseline). The onset of B-cell recovery
based on the median levels from a smaller subset of
30 patients was 10 months after the last infusion
(approximately 11 months after baseline).
Quantitative serum immunoglobulin (Ig) levels
were obtained from serum samples that were evaluated at baseline, before infusions, and every 3 months
thereafter for at least 1 year. There was no evidence
that combination therapy altered Ig levels, because
IgG, IgM, IgA, and IgE levels were analyzed separately; and, in each case, both the mean and median
percent changes from baseline at each evaluation
were small (15% at most time points).

Immunogenicity (Human Antihuman Antibody
and Human Antichimeric Antibody)
Samples for antiepratuzumab (HAHA) and antirituximab (HACA) analyses were collected at baseline and
before the fourth infusion; then, samples were scheduled to be collected at 1 month, 3 months, 6 months,
9 months, 12 months, and 15 months. Of the 49
patients, none (0%) developed positive HAHA,
whereas 4 patients developed transient positive
HACA of uncertain significance at 1 or 2 evaluations,
because no clinical sequelae or apparent pharmacokinetic changes occurred for those patients.

DISCUSSION
Initially, the safety and efficacy of rituximab were
established in patients with relapsed/refractory, lowgrade, or follicular NHL, with a pivotal trial reporting
an OR of 48% and a DR of 11.2 months and with
mild-to-moderate side effects.2,23 Because subsequent studies demonstrated that treatment efficacy
improved when rituximab was combined with other
agents, particularly chemotherapy,24 this antibody is
now used extensively in such regimens in most NHL
types and settings.25,26
Combinations of rituximab with virtually all
other therapeutic agents, including interferon-alpha,
interleukin-2, proteosome inhibitors, and other antibodies, also have been pursued,26 but most attention
in terms of biologicals has been in antibody combinations. The first demonstration in oncology of any
antibody combination suggesting acceptable toxicity
and the possibility of improved efficacy was with

Epratuzumab and Rituximab in NHL/Leonard et al

rituximab and epratuzumab, both clinically and preclinically,10,11,15 but other antibodies also have been
investigated in combination with rituximab27 based
on the supposition that different targets and
mechanisms of action could have additive or synergistic effects without increased toxicity.
We have demonstrated that combination therapy
with 360 mg/m2 epratuzumab and 375 mg/m2 rituximab was tolerated well when administered once
weekly for 4 consecutive weeks. All patients were
able to complete combination therapy except for 1
patient who had a reaction during the first rituximab
infusion and who continued to complete the remaining epratuzumab infusions but did not receive further rituximab infusions. In addition, epratuzumab
and rituximab, when administered in combination,
did not require longer infusion times than previously reported when administered separately.
Infusion reactions in this study occurred predominately during the first infusion, with low-grade
(mild-moderate) chills, rigors, fever, and other constitutional events qualitatively similar to those
observed previously with either agent alone. No
grade 3 or 4 reactions occurred during epratuzumab
infusions, and only 1 patient had a more serious
grade 3 reaction during the first rituximab infusion.
Because grade 3 and 4 reactions have been reported
with rituximab when it was administered as a single
agent,23 these findings further support the safety
of combination therapy with this administration
schedule.
The combination of full doses of these 2 antibodies had no apparent effect on safety laboratories,
because both standard hematology and serum chemistries as well as quantitative serum Ig levels (IgG,
IgM, IgA, IgE) showed no consistent patterns of
change from baseline after combination therapy. On
the basis of HAHA and HACA findings, none of the
49 patients developed HAHA after treatment,
whereas 4 patients developed transient positive
HACA of uncertain significance at 1 or 2 evaluation
times, because no clinical sequelae or apparent pharmacokinetic changes occurred for those patients.
Thus, combination therapy does not appear to
increase the immunogenicity of these antibodies.
Combination therapy effectively depletes peripheral B cells, beginning with the first infusion. Thus,
epratuzumab, which decreases B-cell levels only
modestly when given as a single agent,13,14 does not
interfere with the depletion known to occur when
rituximab is given as a single agent.23,28 Although the
data are based on a smaller subset of patients, the
recovery of B-cell levels within the first year also
appears comparable to results previously obtained

2721

with single-agent rituximab.23,28 Pharmacokinetic
findings also determined that the mean serum terminal-phase half-life of both epratuzumab and rituximab was not affected when the 2 antibodies were
administered in combination.
This multicenter study demonstrated that, in indolent FL, 22 of 41 patients (54%) achieved an OR
according to International Working Group response
criteria, including 10 patients (24%) who achieved a
CR/CRu. It is reassuring that the current study confirmed the pilot results from the single-center study
of the combination of rituximab and epratuzumab,
which reported an OR of 67% in 15 patients with
FL.15 Although the latter study also produced a
higher CR/CRu rate of 56%, all of those patients were
rituximab-naive, had received less prior therapy, and
had a longer period from the prior therapy until they
were accrued to the trial. A European multicenter
trial that studied rituximab combined with epratuzumab in patients with low-grade FL and in patients
with aggressive NHL reported an OR of 64% and a
CR/CRu rate of 24% in patients FL, and those with
FL in the FLIPI 0 to 1 group had an 83% OR rate
(CR/CRu, 33%).29 Indeed, the FLIPI 0 to 1 group in
the current study had an 84.6% OR rate and a 38.5%
CR/CRu rate.
The median DRs of 11.2 months and 15 months
obtained in patients with relapsed/refractory, indolent NHL after the first application of rituximab2,23
and after rituximab retreatment,23,30 respectively, are
consistent with the 13.4-month DR observed for all
FL responders (with and without prior rituximab
therapy) in this study. However, in another, smaller
study of 13 patients with indolent NHL who were
retreated with rituximab, an OR rate of 38% (all PRs)
and a median PFS of 5.1 months were reproted.31 We
appreciate, however, that it is difficult to compare
results between studies with potentially different
patient populations, especially when using data from
nonrandomized, phase 2 trials. Nevertheless, based
on this study and the other 2 trials that studied the
combination of rituximab and epratuzumab,15,29
totaling over 130 patients with NHL, the overall findings demonstrate that, in indolent lymphoma, combined rituximab plus epratuzumab therapy is
effective (with CR/CRu rates that appear to exceed
those reported for rituximab alone), ORs are durable,
and, most important, our new evidence in the current report that patients who achieved CRs have
experienced durable remissions that appear to
exceed those reported in other trials in patients with
FL who were given the standard 4-week rituximab
schedule. Indeed, some remissions currently are continuing for more than 4 years.

There were only 7 patients with SLL in this study,
but 4 of those patients (57%) achieved an OR, including 3 patients (43%) with CRs (CR/CRu). For those
patients with SLL who achieved an OR, the median
DR was 20 months, including 1 patient with a
response that continued for at least 3 years. Thus,
although the current results were limited by the
small number of SLL patients enrolled, combination
therapy also appeared to be effective in this subgroup.
Subgroup analysis performed among all patients
with low-grade NHL examined the influence of prior
rituximab therapy, bone marrow involvement, and
FLIPI score (for FL patients only) on response. Exposure to prior rituximab did not appear to decrease
the effectiveness of combination therapy to achieve
an OR or a CR. In fact, patients with prior exposure
to rituximab responded very well to the antibody
combination, with an overall response of 50% and a
CR/CRu rate of 26%, which appears to be somewhat
better than the rates reported (40% and 11%, respectively) from retreatment with rituximab alone.30
Patients with bone marrow involvement or higher
risk FLIPI scores generally are more difficult to treat,
but combination therapy appeared to be active in
these groups, although the rates of OR and particularly CR were higher, as expected, in patients without
bone marrow involvement or with low-risk FLIPI 0-1
scores (ie, 84.6% OR and 38.5% CR/CRu).
The interesting results from this trial have lead
to the development of Cancer and Leukemia Group
B trial 50701, a study of this combination with an
extended dosing regimen as initial treatment
(without chemotherapy) for FL. In addition to FL, it
has been reported that 4 of 6 patients (67%) with
DLBCL had an OR, and 3 patients achieved a CR.15
An OR rate of 47% (33% CR/CRu) also was observed
in 15 patients DLBCL in the prior multicenter trial of
this combination.29 On the basis of these encouraging results, a trial combining these 2 antibodies
with conventional chemotherapy (combined cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone [CHOP]) indicated that, among 15 previously
untreated patients with DLBCL, there was an OR of
87% (67% CR, 20% PR), a 2-year PFS, and an overall
survival of 86%.32 Thus, the combination of rituximab with epratuzumab also appears to produce
encouraging activity in patients with DLBCL, even
in combination with CHOP. A current trial by the
North Central Cancer Treatment Group (N0409)
currently is evaluating the role of combined epratuzumab, rituximab, and CHOP as initial treatment
for DLBCL. These and other ongoing studies will
serve to establish more definitively the role of

combination antibody therapy with epratuzumab
plus rituximab as initial treatment for B-cell lymphoma.
