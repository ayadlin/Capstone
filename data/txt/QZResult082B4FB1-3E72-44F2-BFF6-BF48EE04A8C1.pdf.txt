Abstract
Src family kinases (SFKs) are commonly deregulated in cancer
cells. Among other functions, SFKs are critical for cellular
migration and invasion. SFK inhibitors are being studied as
targeted cancer drugs, but there are no biomarkers for
noninvasive assessment of SFK inhibition. The aim of this
study was to evaluate whether imaging of AVB3 integrin
activity with positron emission tomography (PET) and
[ 64 Cu]DOTA-cyclo-(Arg-Gly-Asp- D Phe-Lys) {[ 64 Cu]DOTAc(RGDfK)} can be used for monitoring response to the SFK
inhibitor dasatinib. Severe combined immunodeficient mice
bearing U87MG xenografts were gavaged daily over 72 hours
with 72 or 95 mg/kg of dasatinib or vehicle. Tumor uptake of
[64Cu]DOTA-c(RGDfK) was measured by small-animal PET. In
parallel, fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) scans were performed to
assess tumor metabolism in response to dasatinib treatment.
Dasatinib significantly (P < 0.0001) reduced [64Cu]DOTAc(RGDfK) uptake by up to 59% in U87MG xenografts [2.10 F
0.14% injected dose/gram (ID/g) in the 95 mg/kg group
and 3.12 F 0.18% ID/g in the 72 mg/kg group, versus 5.08 F
0.80% ID/g in controls]. In contrast, tumor FDG uptake
showed no significant reduction with dasatinib therapy
(8.13 F 0.45% ID/g in treated versus 10.39 F 1.04% ID/g in
controls; P = 0.170). Histologically, tumors were viable at the
time of the follow-up PET scan but showed inhibition of focal
adhesion kinase. Continued dasatinib treatment resulted in a
significant inhibition of tumor growth (tumor size on day
10 of therapy: 21.13 F 2.60 mm2 in treated animals versus
122.50 F 17.68 mm2 in controls; P = 0.001). [64Cu]DOTAc(RGDfK) may provide a sensitive means of monitoring tumor
response to SFK inhibition in AVB3-expressing cancers early in
the course of therapy. [Cancer Res 2009;69(7):3173–9]

Introduction
Molecularly targeted therapies are becoming increasingly
important in the treatment of cancer, as the signaling mechanisms
underlying malignancy are elucidated. Whereas some smallmolecule inhibitors are effective in a large percentage of patients,
as is the case with imatinib in the treatment of chronic myeloid
leukemia, most targeted therapies are clinically effective in a

limited subset of patients with common solid tumors (e.g., erlotinib
in non–small cell lung cancer; ref. 1). In addition, tumors that
initially respond frequently proceed to develop resistance to
targeted therapy. Therefore, identifying new therapeutic agents
and a means by which to predict and monitor treatment response
are compelling priorities in the field of oncology.
Inhibition of platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFr)
and Src family kinases (SFKs) is a promising anticancer strategy,
as both oncogenes are up-regulated and important in the
pathogenesis of various malignancies, including glioblastoma
multiforme (GBM), soft tissue sarcoma, gastrointestinal cancer,
pancreatic cancer, and melanoma (2–5). Preclinical studies have
shown that inhibition of PDGFr can inhibit growth and reduce
the invasiveness of tumor cells, effects that are mediated through
activation of SFKs (6, 7). These studies support the clinical testing
of dasatinib, an inhibitor of SFKs (and other tyrosine kinases) in
solid tumors, and clinical trials have recently started in
glioblastoma, pancreatic adenocarcinoma, breast cancer, and
non–small cell lung cancer. Such trials would benefit from
noninvasive techniques to monitor the molecular changes in
response to dasatinib therapy.
Positron emission tomography (PET) is a valuable tool for
identifying the molecular changes following therapeutic interventions in patients. For monitoring effects of SFK inhibitors in
patients, PET probes binding to the aVh3 integrin are of particular
interest. The integrin aVh3 is a cellular adhesion molecule that
is frequently expressed on malignant tumors and acts as an
important receptor affecting tumor growth, local invasiveness, and
metastatic potential (8). SFK activity is necessary for localization of
aVh3 to focal adhesions and integrin-mediated migration and
invasion (7).
For imaging of the aVh3 integrin, cyclic pentapeptides containing the tripeptide sequence arginine-glycine-aspartate (RGD)
have been developed. These peptides specifically bind to aVh3
in its activated state but not to related integrins such as aIIbh3
(9, 10). Recent clinical trials have shown that PET imaging with
radiolabeled RGD peptides allows quantitative expression of
activated aVh3 integrin in patients with various malignant tumors
(10, 11).
Based on these data, we hypothesized that PET imaging with
radiolabeled RGD peptides may provide a noninvasive readout for
the anti-invasive effects of SFK inhibition. As a model to test this
hypothesis, we used U87MG, a GBM cell line with high expression
of aVh3 in which PDGFr inhibition has a significant antimigratory
effect in a SFK-dependent manner (7). We show evidence that
dasatinib alters invasion of glioblastoma cells and we show that the
radiolabeled RGD peptide [64Cu]DOTA-c(RGDfK) can be used to
monitor treatment response to dasatinib in vivo.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture. The glioma cell line U87MG was purchased from the
American Type Culture Collection and cultured in DMEM (Invitrogen)
supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Omega Scientific), 2 mg/mL
glucose, 100 units/mL penicillin, and 100 units/mL streptomycin (Invitrogen). Cells were grown at 37jC in an atmosphere of 5% CO2.
Invasion assay. To assess the effect of dasatinib on cell motility, a twodimensional invasion assay was performed using six-well Transwell
polycarbonate membrane inserts with 8.0-Am pores (CoStar) coated from
the bottom with 25 Ag/mL fibronectin (Chemicon) as an extracellular
matrix barrier. After adding serum-free MEM to the lower compartments,
5  105 U87MG cells in serum-free MEM/bovine serum albumin (5 mg/mL)
were seeded onto the upper chambers and incubated for 6 h at 37jC, 5%
CO2. For pharmacologic inhibition, dasatinib (Bristol-Myers Squibb
Oncology) or c(RDGfK) (Peptides International) was added to cells in the
upper chamber at the designated concentrations at the time of plating.
DMSO was used as a vehicle control and to dilute the 20 mmol/L stock
dasatinib. After 6 h, noninvasive cells on the upper surface were removed
with cotton swabs, and the remaining invaded cells on the lower surface
were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and stained with 0.25% cresyl violet. The
number of invasive cells was calculated using pictures of six random fields
per filter taken with an Olympus BX61 microscope (Olympus) at 40
magnification and then calculating the area in each photomicrograph
with purple staining using Soft Imaging Software (Olympus).
Western blot analysis. Protein expression and phosphorylation were
assessed by Western blotting of lysates from cells treated for 6 h with
100 nmol/L dasatinib or control. Antibodies were used against phospho-Src
(Y416; Cell Signaling), phospho–focal adhesion kinase (FAK; Y397; Abcam),
phospho-FAK (Y861; Biosource-Invitrogen), and actin (Sigma). Lysates
treated for 24 h with 100 nmol/L dasatinib or control were stained for h3
expression (Chemicon) and actin (Sigma). Blotting was performed
according to the manufacturer’s instructions and imaged with the LI-COR
Odyssey Imager using IR dye-conjugated secondary antibodies.
Immunofluorescence. To assess focal contact formation, cells grown on
eight-well fibronectin-coated slides (BD BioCoat) and treated for 6 h with
100 nmol/L dasatinib were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde-PBS at 37jC,
permeabilized with 0.3% Triton-PBS, and blocked overnight in 10% normal
goat serum-PBS at 4jC. One microgram of the anti-aVh3 antibody LM609
(Chemicon) was labeled with 10 AL of IgG-TRITC primary labeling solution

(Invitrogen) per manufacturer’s instructions. 4¶,6-Diamidino-2-phenylindole
(Invitrogen) was used as a nuclear stain, and slides were mounted with
Vectashield (Vector Laboratories) for imaging with an Olympus BX61
microscope.
Flow cytometry. U87MG surface aVh3 integrin expression was analyzed
following 6 and 24 h of treatment with 100 nmol/L dasatinib using the antiaVh3 antibody LM609 and goat F(ab¶)2 anti-mouse IgG-phycoerythrin (R&D
Systems; ref. 12). Samples were read on a FACScan Analytic Flow Cytometer
(Becton Dickinson).
Western blots, immunofluorescence, and flow cytometry were performed
after overnight incubation on precoated fibronectin tissue culture plates
(BD BioCoat).

Cu labeling of DOTA-c(RGDfK). The peptide DOTA-c(RGDfK) was
synthesized as described previously (13). Labeling with copper-64 chloride
(MDS Nordion) was performed by incubating 1.25 Ag DOTA-c(RGDfK) with
37 MBq 64Cu for 1 h at 50jC in a total volume of 200 AL of 0.1 mol/L
ammonium acetate at pH 7.1. Purification of the radiolabeled peptide was
performed using a 1-mL Strata-X 33-Am polymeric reversed-phase column
(Phenomenex, Inc.). Following a water wash, the labeled peptide was eluted
in 100% ethanol, dried over argon gas at 60jC, and resuspended in 0.9%
saline. All labeling solutions were pretreated with Chelex-100 (Bio-Rad) at
1.2 g/L. Labeling efficiency ranged from 75% to 85% for a specific activity
of the radiolabeled peptide of 22.2 to 25.6 GBq/mg. Thus, the amount of
peptide injected ranged between 0.74 and 0.83 Ag.
Xenograft model and dasatinib treatment. Severe combined immunodeficient mice were purchased from The Jackson Laboratory. All animal
manipulations were performed with sterile technique following the
guidelines of the University of California at Los Angeles (UCLA) Animal
Research Committee. U87MG (2  106 cells per mouse) were resuspended
in PBS and Matrigel (BD Biosciences) and injected s.c. at the right shoulder
of 7-wk-old male mice. After tumors had grown to an approximate size of
6 mm, groups of three to five animals were gavaged daily with vehicle
(1:1, propylene glycol/water) and 72 or 95 mg/kg of dasatinib. Tumor length
and width were measured over a 10-d period with calipers.
Micro-PET/computed tomography imaging. Sixty-minute dynamic
micro-PET/computed tomography (CT) scans were obtained with 15 to 20
MBq (peptide mass: 0.74–0.83 Ag) [64Cu]DOTA-c(RGDfK) injected via tail
vein after 72 h of dasatinib treatment using a micro-PET FOCUS 220 PET
scanner (Siemens) and a MicroCAT II CT scanner (Siemens; ref. 14). Fifteen
hours later, animals underwent another micro-PET/CT study (10-min static

emission scan, 7-min micro-CT scan; refs. 15, 16). PET images were
reconstructed by filtered back projection using a ramp filter to yield an
image resolution of 1.7 mm (17). In a separate experiment, static emission
[18F]fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) micro-PET/CT scans were performed with
7 to 10 MBq FDG (mass, <0.1 Ag) after 1-h uptake in animals treated for
72 h with dasatinib or vehicle control.
Image analysis. To determine tracer concentration in various tissues,
ellipsoid regions of interest were placed in the region that exhibited the
highest radioactivity as determined by visual inspection on fused micro-PET/
CT images generated by the AMIDE software (18). Tracer uptake in the
xenograft tumors and normal tissues are expressed as percent of the decaycorrected injected activity per cm3 of tissue [percentage injected dose/gram
(% ID/g)]. Previous studies have shown that uptake of [64Cu]DOTA-c(RGDfK)
correlates closely with the expression of activated aVh3 integrins (19).
Immunohistochemistry. Following anesthetization and sacrifice of mice,
tumors were removed and frozen in liquid nitrogen. Frozen tumor tissues
were sectioned (6 Am) and stained with H&E following standard protocols
or immunohistochemically stained with primary antibodies against CD31
(BD Pharmingen), phospho-FAK (Y861), and aVh3 (Chemicon) followed by
biotinylated secondary antibodies and avidin-biotin complex (Vector
Laboratories). Visualization of all staining was performed with NovaRed
substrate (Vector Laboratories) and tissues were counterstained with
hematoxylin. Images were generated with an Olympus BX61 microscope.
Statistical analysis. Quantitative results are expressed as mean F 1 SD.
Comparisons were made by t tests or by ANOVA as appropriate (GraphPad
Prism, GraphPad Software). Differences were considered significant when
P < 0.050.

Results
U87 invasion is dependent on AVB3 function and is inhibited
by dasatinib. U87MG cells plated in fibronectin-coated Boyden
chambers and treated with 50 or 100 nmol/L of dasatinib for

6 hours showed a significant reduction in invasion compared with
control (40.30 F 7.86% and 15.36 F 5.70% of control, respectively;
P < 0.001; Fig. 1A and B). To determine the importance of aVh3
function in U87MG invasion, cells were treated with 2 mmol/L
c(RGDfK) peptide to effectively saturate all available functional
binding sites (20). This inhibited the ability of U87MG to invade
through fibronectin to 11.48 F 3.35% of controls (P < 0.001; Fig. 1A
and B). A similar reduction in invasiveness was observed when
cells were grown on collagen, which is not a ligand of the aVh3
integrin.
Dasatinib inhibits phosphorylation of SFKs and FAK and
impairs the formation of focal adhesions. Cell lysates prepared
for Western blot following 6 hours of 100 nmol/L dasatinib
treatment showed target inhibition of SFK phosphorylation at
activation site Tyr416 and FAK at Tyr861 phosphorylation, a SFKdependent activation site. A decrease was also seen in FAK Tyr397,
an integrin-dependent autophosphorylation site (Fig. 2A).
Immunofluorescence was used to study the effect of SFK/FAK
inhibition on the formation of focal adhesion complexes in U87
cells on a fibronectin surface. Staining for dimerized aVh3 showed
the integrin localized on the cell surface in numerous focal
adhesions in control U87MG cells (Fig. 2B). Following 3 hours of
100 nmol/L dasatinib treatment, cell morphology was notably
altered as seen in the images and aVh3 was no longer clustered in
focal adhesion complexes (Fig. 2B). By 6 hours, the ability of the
cells to remain attached to the fibronectin surface was so impaired
that there were insufficient numbers of attached cells remaining on
the slides to stain. Total levels of dimerized cell surface aVh3
protein level following 6 or 24 hours of 100 nmol/L dasatinib did
not change relative to control as assessed by FACS, nor did total h3

levels decrease in a Western blot of corresponding cell lysates
(Fig. 2C and D, 6-hour data not shown).
Dasatinib decreases uptake of [64Cu]DOTA-c(RGDfK) in
U87MG xenografts and markedly inhibits tumor growth.
Dasatinib treatment significantly reduced [64Cu]DOTA-c(RGDfK)
uptake by 39% in the 72 mg/kg dose group and 59% in the
95 mg/kg dose group after 72 hours of treatment (2.10 F 0.14% ID/
g, n = 3, in 95 mg/kg; 3.12 F 0.18% ID/g, n = 4, in 72 mg/kg;
5.08 F 0.80% ID/g, n = 7, in controls) as shown in Fig. 3A and B
(P < 0.0001, one-way ANOVA). Tumor-to-muscle and tumor-toblood ratios showed similar changes with dasatinib therapy
(Fig. 3C and D). The effect of dasatinib on tracer kinetics in the
tumor and normal organs were examined with dynamic PET scans,
which showed that tracer distribution and organ uptake were
virtually identical between treated and untreated animals except in
the U87 xenografts (Fig. 4).
In contrast to the RGD peptide tracer, there was no significant
change in FDG uptake with 72 hours of 95 mg/kg dasatinib
treatment (P = 0.1704; Fig. 5A), indicating that the tumor cells
remained viable during dasatinib treatment.
U87MG tumor growth was markedly inhibited with continued
dasatinib treatment, resulting in a 6-fold difference in tumor size
between control (122.50 F 17.68 mm2) and treated animals
(21.13 F 12.60 mm2) after 10 consecutive days of treatment
(P = 0.0011, t test). However, at the time of PET imaging, no
appreciable difference in tumor size was present (P = 0.1272; Fig. 5B).

Dasatinib does not decrease in vivo tumor viability,
vascularization, or aVh3 expression, whereas target inhibition
is shown. Target inhibition of the s.c. tumors was shown by
staining for phospho-FAK (Y861), which was reduced in treated
tumors relative to control. Nevertheless, U87MG s.c. xenografts
remained viable and vascularized following 72 hours of treatment
with 95 mg/kg dasatinib as shown by staining with H&E and the
endothelial marker CD31 (Fig. 5C). There was also no difference
in aVh3 staining between treated and control tumors (Fig. 5C).

Discussion
In this study, we show that dasatinib treatment of human
glioblastoma xenografts causes a rapid decrease in the uptake of
the radiolabeled aVh3 ligand [64Cu]DOTA-c(RGDfK). In contrast,
imaging of tumor glucose metabolism with FDG-PET did not reveal
significant differences between animals treated with vehicle or
dasatinib, although tumor growth was markedly inhibited by
dasatinib therapy after 10 days of treatment. These findings suggest
that PET with [64Cu]DOTA-c(RGDfK) may represent a useful
biomarker for monitoring noninvasively the cytostatic effects of
dasatinib therapy.
Others have previously reported that dasatinib inhibits in vitro
invasion in a variety of solid tumor types at nanomolar
concentrations, confirming that invasion is commonly mediated
through the activity of SFKs in malignant cells (21, 22). Our in vitro

Noninvasive Imaging of SFK Inhibition with RGD Peptides

injection. With the exception of the xenograft U87 tumor, there is no appreciable difference in tracer uptake in tissues of animals treated with dasatinib compared
with control.

data showing a significant loss of invasiveness after treatment with
50 nmol/L dasatinib show that this is also the case in the U87MG
glioma cell line. Furthermore, our in vitro data indicate that
U87MG relies heavily on the interaction between aVh3 and specific
substrates, such as fibronectin, for invasion in a two-dimensional
invasion model. When integrin binding sites were saturated with
an excess of c(RGDfK), or when aVh3 binding substrate was absent
as on a collagen surface, in vitro invasion of U87MG cells was
greatly reduced.
Our in vitro and in vivo data suggest that dasatinib exerts its
anti-invasive effect in U87MG through an inhibition of focal
contact formation and loss of integrin activation that occur
following impairment of SFK and FAK activation. The aVh3
integrin exists in two states: an active state that bind ligands, such
as the extracellular matrix proteins fibrinogen and fibronectin, and
an inactive state that has a much lower affinity for these proteins
and peptides (23, 24). Integrin activation also affects binding of

www.aacrjournals.org

synthetic ligands, such as cyclic RGD peptides (24). When integrins
are mobilized to the cell surface and become activated, they group
in clusters known as focal adhesions with a variety of other
intracellular proteins. Focal adhesions form the interface between
the extracellular matrix, cell surface integrins, and the cytoskeleton.
These dynamic groups of structural and regulatory proteins also
transduce external signals to the cell interior (24). The effect of
SFKs on integrin-dependent invasion is mediated through FAK,
which recruits other focal contact proteins or their regulators that
dictate the assembly or disassembly of focal contacts and lead to
cell migration (25, 26).
In our in vitro experiments, dasatinib inhibited SFKs and FAK at
nanomolar concentrations. Furthermore, cell surface distribution
of the aVh3 integrin was drastically changed with dasatinib
treatment. Whereas in untreated cells the aVh3 integrin was
clustered in focal adhesions, the cell surface stained much more
diffusely for the aVh3 integrin following dasatinib therapy. In

that tumors are still viable following 72 h of 95 mg/kg dasatinib treatment. B, U87MG xenograft tumor growth in controls and animals treated daily with 95 mg/kg

no evidence of treatment-induced necrosis on H&E staining or decreased vascularization (CD31 staining). In addition, aVh3 expression on the cell surface is
unchanged with dasatinib therapy (LM609 antibody staining). Phospho-FAK (P-FAK ) is markedly decreased, showing successful target inhibition by dasatinib.

contrast, dasatinib did not measurably affect the total protein
levels of the aVh3 integrin or the amount of the aVh3 integrin on
the cell surface. Thus, alterations in integrin clustering and
activation, as opposed to a decrease in protein levels, seem to be
the result of SFK/FAK inhibition.
Our in vivo data are also consistent with the hypothesis that
dasatinib interferes with integrin activation and thereby reduces
uptake of [64Cu]DOTA-c(RGDfK). At the time of PET imaging,
treated xenografts were identical in size to vehicle-treated tumors
and there was no evidence for treatment-induced necrosis on
histopathologic analysis. Moreover, a significant reduction in the
tumor vasculature or integrin expression was not observed. Thus,

Cancer Res 2009; 69: (7). April 1, 2009

the drastically reduced uptake of [64Cu]DOTA-c(RGDfK) in treated
xenografts cannot be explained by tumor cell death, a reduction in
tumor perfusion, or a reduction in integrin expression. However,
as suggested by the in vitro data, dasatinib seems to decrease
integrin activation resulting in decreased binding of [64Cu]DOTAc(RGDfK).
In conclusion, our study indicates that PET imaging with
radiolabeled RGD peptides represents a novel approach for
imaging in vivo changes in tumor cell invasiveness in response to
dasatinib. In contrast to existing techniques, PET allows longitudinal noninvasive studies that are of great interest for clinical trials,
especially in diseases such as glioblastoma where serial biopsies are

challenging or impossible for ethical reasons. PET imaging with
RGD peptides has already been successfully used clinically to image
the aVh3 integrin in a variety of malignant tumors (10, 11).
Therefore, it will be straightforward to test our preclinical findings
on monitoring dasatinib therapy with PET in clinical trials. When
validated clinically, PET imaging with RGD peptides could become
a unique tool for noninvasive studies of the invasive and metastatic
