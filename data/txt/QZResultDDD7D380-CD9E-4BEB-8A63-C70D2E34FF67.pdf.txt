Using a screen for Wnt/b-catenin inhibitors, a family of
8-hydroxyquinolone derivatives with in vivo anti-cancer
properties was identiﬁed. Analysis of microarray data
for the lead compound N-((8-hydroxy-7-quinolinyl)
(4-methylphenyl)methyl)benzamide (HQBA) using the
Connectivity Map database suggested that it is an iron
chelator that mimics the hypoxic response. HQBA
chelates Fe2 þ with a dissociation constant of B1019 M,
with much weaker binding to Fe3 þ and other transition
metals. HQBA inhibited proliferation of multiple cell lines
in culture, and blocked the progression of established
spontaneous cancers in two distinct genetically engineered
mouse models of mammary cancer, MMTV-Wnt1 and
MMTV-PyMT mice, without overt toxicity. HQBA may
inhibit an iron-dependent factor that regulates cell-typespeciﬁc b-catenin-driven transcription. It inhibits cancer
cell proliferation independently of its effect on b-catenin
signaling, as it works equally well in MMTV-PyMT
tumors and diverse b-catenin-independent cell lines.
HQBA is a promising speciﬁc intracellular Fe2 þ chelator
with activity against spontaneous mouse mammary
cancers.

Introduction
Wnt signaling has diverse roles in development and
during adult tissue homeostasis and repair. Dysregulated Wnt signaling is commonly found in cancer,
often resulting in stabilization of b-catenin. Increased

b-catenin protein abundance, followed by nuclear
localization, leads to transcriptional regulation by
interaction with members of the Lef/T-cell factor family
and activation of gene expression. The ability of
b-catenin to activate speciﬁc genes is determined by
a number of cell- and tissue-speciﬁc factors, including
co-expression of interacting transcriptional regulators,
the epigenetic programming of the cells and the context
of the T-cell-factor-response elements (Mosimann et al.,
2009; Teo and Kahn, 2010). Because of this diversity of
b-catenin-regulated genes, activation of Wnt/b-catenin
signaling can stimulate proliferation or it can favor
terminal differentiation (Henderson et al., 2010; Lucero
et al., 2010). Although disruption of the signaling
cascade leading to b-catenin stabilization is being
pursued as a therapeutic option in cancer, in some
settings, it may be useful to speciﬁcally inhibit subsets
of Wnt/b-catenin signaling (Teo and Kahn, 2010).
Cell-based small molecule screens for the discovery
of new compounds and novel signaling components
offer the advantage of providing diverse and potentially
novel targets for small molecules, with the disadvantage
being the challenge of identifying those targets. The
Wnt/b-catenin signaling pathway is an attractive system
for drug development, as Wnt signaling participates
in multiple processes (Coombs et al., 2008). Aberrant
b-catenin signaling occurs in many cancers. The most
prominent example is colon cancer, in which mutations
in the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) gene contribute to stabilization of b-catenin. However, targeting
b-catenin alone may not be sufﬁcient, as there is
increasing evidence that b-catenin is not the critical
target of APC mutations in colon cancers (Phelps et al.,
2009; Rai et al., 2010). It might be useful, therefore, to
ﬁnd compounds that inhibit subsets of b-catenin targets
and have additional antiproliferative effects that are
independent of the Wnt/b-catenin pathway. Frequently,
biochemical studies of small molecules can reveal effects
reaching well beyond the originally targeted pathway.
Although in cancer, the key indicator of therapeutic
value for any small molecule is whether it can reverse
tumors in relevant animal models and humans, a
thorough understanding of its molecular, cellular and

in vivo effects is invaluable to the design of preclinical
and clinical studies.
In a cell-based screen for small molecule inhibitors
of Wnt/b-catenin signaling, we identiﬁed a series of
compounds that inhibited Wnt/b-catenin signaling with
nanomolar inhibitory constant 50 values and acted
downstream of b-catenin. The activities of one member
of this family, which we term N-((8-hydroxy-7-quinolinyl)
(4-methylphenyl)methyl)benzamide (HQBA), were
investigated in depth. HQBA is a potent inhibitor
of b-catenin signaling in a subset of cancer cell lines,
all of which are derived from colon cancers. HQBA
also inhibits cell proliferation in most cell lines. Most
importantly, HQBA is able to reverse the growth of
established cancers in two genetically engineered mouse
models of mammary cancer, MMTV-Wnt1 and
MMTV-PyMT mice. HQBA perturbs diverse signaling
pathways, suggesting it functions by alterations in basic
cellular physiology. Gene expression analysis suggested,

and subsequent biophysical analysis conﬁrmed that
HQBA is a very high (KaB1020 M1) afﬁnity ferrous
iron chelator. Further experiments in cells and in
embryos indicate that its cytotoxic effects and modulation of Wnt and survival signaling pathways can be
attributed to its iron chelating ability. Its efﬁcacy
without overt toxicity in mouse models of cancer
indicates it warrants additional study for use in man.

Results
Identiﬁcation of a novel Wnt/b-catenin signaling inhibitor
To identify therapeutic targets by which b-cateninmediated Wnt signaling could be modulated in cancer,
we constructed cell-based screens in which luciferase is
expressed in response to initiation of signaling at various
points in the pathway (Figure 1a; McCulloch et al.,

Figure 1 Identiﬁcation of a novel pharmacophore that rapidly and speciﬁcally inhibits Wnt/b-catenin signaling. (a) Overview of the
screens used to ﬁnd Wnt/b-catenin inhibitors and identify their site of action. Reporter activity initiation points are outlined in green.
They are (1) stable expression of WNT3A, (2) WNT3A-conditioned media, (3) stable expression of the constitutively active co-receptor
mutant LRP6DN, (4) overexpression of Dvl-1, (5) stable expression of the non-degraded S45A mutant of b-catenin and (6) constitutive
expression of luciferase from the SV40 promoter. (b, c) Chembridge compounds 5848633 and 5923764 at 10 mM inhibited autocrine
WNT3A signaling by 81% and 83%, respectively, relative to vehicle-treated control. Bars represent luciferase activity normalized to
endogenous lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). (d) Dose curves for each lead inhibitor indicate similar nanomolar inhibitory constant 50
(IC50) for inhibition of autocrine WNT3A signaling. (e) HQBA inhibits autocrine WNT3A-stimulated signaling with nanomolar
efﬁciency. The structure of HQBA is shown in the inset. (f) HQBA acts downstream of stabilized b-catenin. Super Topﬂash reporter
cells stably expressing WNT3A (black) or transfected with 500 ng of Dvl-1 plasmid (dark gray) or 50 ng of b-catenin S45A plasmid
(light gray) were treated for 18 h with 260 nM to 10 mM HQBA. The % b-catenin signaling is the ratio of luciferase activity over
endogenous LDH activity normalized to % of vehicle controls.

2009a, b; Coombs et al., 2010). In a screen of a 50 000
compound synthetic small molecule library, we identiﬁed compounds 5923764 and 5848633 (Figures 1b and c
and Supplementary Table 2) that potently inhibited
signaling. These compounds are 480% identical
(as speciﬁed in search of Chembridge (San Diego, CA,
USA) Hit2lead database), suggesting that they represent
a single pharmacophore. Conﬁrmatory dose ranging
studies indicated that both compounds inhibited Wnt/
b-catenin signaling with inhibitory constant 50 values
between 300 and 600 nM (Figure 1d).
To better deﬁne relevant components of the pharmacophore, we obtained additional compounds that were at least
70% structurally related to one of the lead compounds, and
measured inhibitory constant 50 values for b-catenin
signaling inhibition (for structure activity relationship data,
see Supplementary Table 2). One variant, Chembridge
compound 5839152 (HQBA) had the best ratio of Wnt
inhibition to cytotoxicity after 24 h on HEK293-based
reporter cell lines relative to the lead compounds. This
compound was selected for scaled up synthesis (1 g) for
mechanistic studies. The re-synthesized HQBA showed
identical inhibition of Wnt/b-catenin signaling to that of the
original library compound (Figure 1e).
HQBA speciﬁcally inhibits Wnt signaling downstream
of b-catenin stabilization
To better deﬁne the site of action of HQBA, we tested
doses ranging from 260 nM to 10 mM on signaling in the
HEK293 cells with an integrated Super Topﬂash
reporter (Super Topﬂash cell line) initiated by stable
expression of WNT3A or transient overexpression of
Dvl-1 or S45A b-catenin (Figure 1f). We observed
similar dose-dependent inhibition of signaling regardless
of initiation point, suggesting that HQBA functions
downstream of the stabilization of b-catenin.
In colon cancers, b-catenin is stabilized due to
mutations in the APC protein. We therefore tested
whether HQBA functioned in APC-mutant cell lines,
SW480 and DLD-1, with APC truncated at codons 1338
and 1416, respectively. SW480 and DLD-1 cells were
treated overnight with 4 mM HQBA, and then relative
transcript levels of several potential b-catenin-response
genes were assessed. We ﬁrst conﬁrmed in SW480 cells
that two distinct small interfering RNAs that knocked
down b-catenin by 490% (Figure 2a) caused consistent
reduction of axin2 and cyclin D1 gene expression,
although they had no effect on peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)D expression. Treatment
with HQBA paralleled the effect of b-catenin knockdown, with reduction of axin2 and cyclin D1 and no
effect on PPARD gene expression. HQBA is not a
general inhibitor of gene expression, as it had no effect
on transcript level of b-catenin and a number of other
tested transcripts (data not shown). In fact, HQBA
treatment reproducibly leads to small increases in
b-catenin mRNA abundance in a number of cell lines.
Similar results were observed in DLD-1 cells (data not
shown), and the dose-dependent knockdown of axin2
protein by HQBA was conﬁrmed (Figure 2b).

To further investigate the mechanism of Wnt signaling inhibition by HQBA, we assessed the time-course
of axin2 and c-Myc mRNA abundance in DLD-1 cells
(Figure 2c). Treatment with HQBA reduces mRNA
abundance of both genes quickly, with maximal effect
within 1 h, suggesting that HQBA directly affects gene
transcription or mRNA stability.
HQBA inhibits Wnt-mediated Fgf8 expression in vivo
To examine the speciﬁc effects of HQBA on Wnt target
genes in vivo, we isolated chick embryo neural tissue that
expresses Wnt1 and the Wnt-mediated target gene Fgf8.
Canonical Wnt signals are required for the maintenance
of expression of Fgf8 at the midbrain hindbrain
boundary region in vertebrates (Canning et al., 2007;
Coombs et al., 2010). Double in situ hybridization
demonstrated the expression of both Wnt1 (red) and
Fgf8 (blue) in tissue isolated from the midbrain to
anterior hindbrain region (Figure 2d). Treatment of this
tissue with HQBA results in the loss of Fgf8 mRNA,
with no effect on the expression of endogenous Wnt1
mRNA. Hence, HQBA can block b-catenin target gene
expression in cultured cells and in embryos (Figure 2e).
HQBA exhibits potent cytotoxicity in vitro
The initial signaling assays were performed with
12–24 h exposure to HQBA. We noted, however, that
with longer incubation times, HQBA was increasingly
cytotoxic toward a broad range of cancer cells (Table 1)
derived from tumors of various origins including breast,
cervical, colorectal, gastric and hepatocellular. The
killing mechanism does not appear to require known
Wnt/b-catenin pathway mutations, as diverse cell types
without known b-catenin stabilization were also sensitive to the compound. Killing was slow in most cell lines.
The lethal dose 50 values after 3 days of treatment
averaged 20 mM with a range from 17 to 38 mM, with
relatively few cell types displaying sub-mM sensitivity.
By contrast, in a 7-day cytotoxicity assay, the average
lethal dose 50 values dropped to 960 nM, with a range
of 48 nM to 4 mM, with many cell lines showing a 10- to
100-fold increase in sensitivity.
A number of cell types with known activation of the
Wnt/b-catenin pathway (for example, HT29 and
SW480, both with APC mutations) were less sensitive
to HQBA than lines without known Wnt/b-catenin
pathway mutations (for example, RKO, HeLa and
TC-71). To determine whether HQBA might not affect
Wnt/b-catenin signaling in all cell types, its ability to
inhibit the endogenous b-catenin-response genes axin2
and c-Myc was assessed in a set of seven cancer cell lines
(Table 2). HQBA inhibited expression of axin2 and
c-Myc in some but not all cell types. Notably, HQBA
did not inhibit axin2 in HT29 cells with mutant APC,
nor did it inhibit axin2 in STF3A cells, in which it was
able to inhibit signaling from the SuperTopFlash
promoter. These ﬁndings suggest that HQBA does not
inhibit all b-catenin-dependent transcription, and that it
may therefore be acting on an as yet unidentiﬁed
transcriptional regulator that is not critical in all tissues.

Figure 2 HQBA rapidly inhibits expression of endogenous Wnt/b-catenin-response genes. (a) Endogenous Wnt/b-catenin target genes
axin2 and cyclin D1 are inhibited by both b-catenin knockdown and HQBA. DLD-1 cells were treated with either small interfering
RNA (siRNA) against b-catenin siRNA (72 h) or 4 mM HQBA (18 h) as indicated, and then target gene expression was quantitated
by quantitative PCR. HQBA phenocopies the effect of b-catenin knockdown. *Po0.002; þ Po0.015 for difference from control by

as determined by SDS–polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunoblot. (c) DLD-1 cells were treated for 0–8 h with 4 mM HQBA,
and abundance of the Wnt-responsive genes axin2 and c-Myc were measured by quantitative PCR. (d) HQBA suppresses expression
of Wnt target gene Fgf8. Control midbrain to rhombomere 2 explants positive for the expression of Wnt1 (red) and Fgf8 (blue).
(e) HQBA (1 mM) suppresses the expression of Fgf8 (blue). No change in the expression of Wnt1 was observed. (f) Ferrous
ethylenediammonium sulfate (0.5 mM) was sufﬁcient to rescue the expression of Fgf8 in the presence of 1.0 mM HQBA.

We also noted that in some cell lines (for example,
SW480 and DLD-1), HQBA increased b-catenin mRNA
while still decreasing axin2 abundance. This is consistent
with HQBA inhibition of b-catenin signaling downstream of b-catenin protein abundance. The cause of
this increase in b-catenin mRNA is not yet understood.
Not all cell types were sensitive to HQBA. Both
non-transformed human mammary epithelial cells, and
their isogenic RasV12 expressing, p53-knockdowntransformed counterparts were relatively insensitive to
HQBA. Similarly to these human mammary epithelial
cell lines, primary mouse mammary epithelial cells were
5.4- to 65-fold less sensitive than the majority of cancer
cell lines to killing by HQBA after 7 days of treatment.

Many cancers are thought to require b-catenin signaling
for continued proliferation. We therefore evaluated
the efﬁcacy of HQBA in vivo toward Wnt-initiated
and Wnt/b-catenin-dependent spontaneously developing mammary tumors in MMTV-Wnt1-transgenic mice.
About 15% of these mice develop mammary tumors
between 6 weeks and 3 months of age. After the tumors
reached at least 40 mm3, the affected mice were injected
once daily with either vehicle (5% dimethyl sulfoxide in
pure olive oil) or with 9 mg/kg HQBA for up to 32 days
(Figure 3a). Sustained regression was observed to an

average tumor volume of B20% of starting volume in
33% of treated mice. In the control group (n ¼ 8), all
tumors grew steadily with an average doubling time of
5 days. The difference between the average tumor
growth rates in the treated and untreated groups was
highly signiﬁcant (Po0.0001). HQBA did not cause
obvious toxicity to normal tissues, as there was no
signiﬁcant difference in body weight between control
and treated mice (P ¼ 0.37).
One concern with drugs that might target Wnt/
b-catenin signaling is toxicity in the intestine, as a
number of studies have demonstrated loss of gut
integrity when Wnt/b-catenin signaling is interrupted.
We therefore speciﬁcally examined the gross and micro-

scopic morphology of large and small intestines from
HQBA-treated and control mice, and found no
differences (Figure 3b). Thus, HQBA does not appear
to be toxic to non-transformed intestinal cells.
To determine whether a higher HQBA dose would
increase the response rate, a second study was subsequently conducted, in which ﬁve MMTV-Wnt1 mice
with mammary tumors were treated with 75±15 mg/kg
of HQBA and three mice were treated with vehicle as
control (Figure 3c). HQBA treatment caused an average
40% decrease in tumor volume by day 6, and no net
growth over the 13-day course of the study. By contrast,
the tumors in the control mice grew rapidly, resulting
in up to 20-fold increase in tumor volume in the same

dosage, treated mice initially lost body weight (10% by
day 4), but caught up with control mice by the end of
the study.
Our cell toxicity data suggested HQBA might be effective regardless of Wnt/b-catenin pathway dependence.
To determine whether HQBA was effective in other
tumor types in vivo, we tested it in a second genetically
engineered mouse model. MMTV-PyMT-transgenic

mice develop mammary tumors in response to oncogenic levels of Ras and phosphoinositide 3-kinase
signaling induced by the expression of polyoma middle
T antigen in mammary tissues (Guy et al., 1992). These
tumors have no evidence of Wnt/b-catenin pathway
activation (Herschkowitz et al., 2007). Female MMTVPyMT mice that spontaneously developed mammary
tumors were treated with HQBA at two doses, 20 mg/kg
per day (n ¼ 5) and 70 mg/kg per day (n ¼ 2). HQBA

treatment resulted in substantially decreased tumor
growth, such that after 10 days tumors were on average
only 1/5 the size of those in control mice, with no
signiﬁcant effect on body weight (Figure 3d). (P for
both doses o0.0001.) This indicates HQBA is effective
in genetically engineered mouse models of both Wntdependent and Wnt-independent tumors.
The molecular target of HQBA
The ability of HQBA to inhibit b-catenin signaling in
a subset of cell types with activating mutations, and its
signiﬁcant effects on growth of spontaneous murine
mammary cancers, lead us to extensive efforts to
identify the cellular target of the molecule. Both
unmodiﬁed and photocrosslinker-containing biotinylated analogs of HQBA were synthesized, but despite
exhaustive efforts, did not lead to identiﬁcation of a
functionally relevant protein target. As an independent
approach, we queried the Connectivity Map (CMAP)
(Lamb et al., 2006; Lamb, 2007) to determine whether

HQBA altered gene expression in a pattern similar to
compounds with a known mechanism of action. MCF7
cells were treated with HQBA or vehicle for 6 h and
microarray signatures of upregulated and downregulated genes were generated (see Supplementary Table 3).
Table 3 shows compounds in the CMAP database
whose transcriptional signatures are most similar to
those of HQBA. Strikingly, although none of the top
matches appear chemically related to HQBA, two of the
four compounds with the most similar transcriptome
signatures are known iron chelators. The top hit,
ciclopirox, is an iron chelator used clinically as a topical
antifungal agent. Notably, ciclopirox was recently
reported to have anti-cancer activity in vitro and in
xenograft models (Eberhard et al., 2009; Zhou et al.,
2010). The second best hit is a Chembridge compound
(5109870) with no reported target. Of the more distant
hits, deferoxamine is a clinically approved non-cell
permeable high-afﬁnity ferric iron chelator, whereas
dimethyloxaloylglycine activates hypoxia-inducible
factor-1a (HIF-1a) by inhibition of the iron-containing

Figure 4 HQBA induces a hypoxia response, but Wnt/b-catenin

enzyme prolyl hydroxylase (Jaakkola et al., 2001). Thus,
the CMAP data suggests HQBA functions through
either iron chelation, or less likely, through induction of
HIF-1a.
We conﬁrmed that, as predicted from the CMAP
proﬁle, both ciclopirox and HQBA stabilize HIF-1a
protein in SW480 cells. In addition, ciclopirox, similar
to HQBA, causes a decrease in axin2 protein abundance
(Figure 4a). As a further indication of overlap with the
hypoxia response, HQBA, ciclopirox and 5109870 are
more effective than dimethyloxaloylglycine and deferoxamine at inducing the hypoxia-inducible genes NDRG1
and PPFIA4 (Figure 4b). dimethyloxaloylglycine and
deferoxamine differ from HQBA, as they do not decrease
expression of the Wnt/b-catenin target gene AXIN2.
To test whether the hypoxia response directly
mediated the inhibition of b-catenin signaling, the effect
of hypoxia on the b-catenin-response genes AXIN2 and
COX2 was assessed. As Figure 4c shows, both HQBA
and hypoxia robustly induced expression of ADM and
PPFIA4. However, HQBA but not hypoxia represses
expression of AXIN2 and COX2. We conclude that
HQBA induces the hypoxia response but has additional
hypoxia-independent activities that include inhibition of
b-catenin signaling in selected cell types.
Metal-chelating activity of HQBA
As an initial test of the metal chelating abilities
of HQBA, we examined the ultraviolet absorbance
spectrum of HQBA in the presence of increasing ferrous
sulfate (Figure 5a). Increasing [Fe2 þ ] caused a dosedependent decrease in the A245, and a saturation plot
indicated binding occurred with a stoichiometry of
2 mol HQBA to each mole of Fe2 þ (Figure 5b). HQBA
also chelates Co2 þ , Ni2 þ , Cu2 þ and Zn2 þ but not Mn2 þ
(Figure 5c). With the exception of Fe3 þ , which binds
HQBA with 1:1 stoichiometry, all other metals bound
with a one metal: two ligand ratio.
The clinically used iron chelator deferoxamine has
a preference for binding ferric (Fe3 þ ) iron, with a Kd of
B1031 M compared with B1010 M for Fe2 þ (Keberle,
1964). In assessing binding afﬁnities and thermodynamic
parameters by isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC),
we found that HQBA bound most metals including
ferric (Fe3 þ ) iron with modest Kd values ranging from
100 nM to 20 mM. However, in contrast to deferoxamine,
HQBA bound ferrous iron (Fe2 þ ) with an afﬁnity X1011
times higher than all other metals tested, with an
estimated dissociation constant of 120 zM (1.2  1019 M).
Stoichiometries determined by ITC agree with those
obtained by spectroscopy (Table 4). We also veriﬁed that
the compound 5109870 is an iron chelator, and displays
identical two chelator: one Fe2 þ stoichiometry (Supplementary Figure 1). Thus, HQBA is a novel high afﬁnity,
high selectivity ferrous iron chelator.
The biological effects of HQBA are due to iron chelation
HQBA shares with the structurally unrelated small
molecules ciclopirox and 9870 both the ability to chelate
iron, and the ability to downregulate Wnt/b-catenin

Figure 5 HQBA is an iron chelator. (a) Mixture of 10 mM HQBA
with varying concentrations of FeCl2 dose dependently reduced the

signaling. This strongly suggests that chelation of
intracellular iron is responsible for the biological effects
of HQBA. We investigated whether or not iron
chelation was responsible for the observed cytotoxicity
of HQBA. Pre-mixing of HQBA with 1 M equivalent
of Fe2 þ completely abrogated its toxicity (Figure 6a)
toward the highly sensitive cell lines AGS (gastric),
DLD-1 (colorectal) and PA-1 (teratoma) and blocked its
ability to inhibit Wnt/b-catenin signaling (Figure 6b).
The effect of HQBA on Fgf8 expression in chick
explants was similarly rescued by the addition of
0.5 mM ferrous ethylene diammonium sulfate (Figure 2f).
Conﬁrming that the inhibition was due to the effect of
intracellular iron, similar results were obtained when
DLD-1 and HCT116 cells were preincubated with FeCl3
for up to 24 h followed by extensive washes, before

In a cell-based screen for small molecules that inhibit
Wnt/b-catenin signaling, we identiﬁed a closely related
series of compounds with efﬁcacy at high nanomolar
concentrations. The selected lead, HQBA, is a previously
unreported molecule that chelates Fe2 þ with zeptomolar
afﬁnity, inhibits Wnt/b-catenin signaling in a subset of
colon cancer cell lines and vertebrate embryos, has a
broad spectrum of antiproliferative effects in cultured
human cancer cell lines, and most importantly, inhibits
tumor growth in two distinct genetically engineered
mouse models of cancer without signiﬁcant acute toxicity.
The activity of HQBA in two genetically engineered
mouse models of cancer without overt toxicity suggests
the compound has good bioavailability and a reasonable
half-life with once daily dosing. HQBA is a novel Fe2 þ
chelator with anti-cancer potential.
A number of small molecules that chelate iron have
shown promise as cancer-cell-speciﬁc cytotoxic agents
(Richardson et al., 2009). Diverse mechanisms have
been proposed to explain how iron chelators kill cancer
cells, possibly because of the fundamentally important
role of iron in cells, and the ever-increasing number of
proteins that have been found to require Fe (II) and/or
iron–sulfur clusters for activity (Sheftel et al., 2010).
Iron is required to prevent the hypoxic response, for
DNA replication and repair, protein synthesis, and
for mitochondrial energy generation. As HQBA inhibits
transcription of b-catenin target genes in a subset of
cells, our study additionally suggests a role for ironcontaining proteins in b-catenin-dependent transcription in a tissue-speciﬁc manner. It is likely that different
cell types and different tissues in animals have distinct
iron requirements. Hence, iron can be a rate-limiting
co-factor in a broad array of cellular activities. This may

Figure 6 The activity of HQBA is reversed by iron. (a) AGS, PA-1 and DLD-1 cells were incubated in the presence of 9.8 nM to 20 mM
HQBA±0.5 M equivalents of ferrous ethylenediammonium sulfate tetrahydrate for 72 h in 96-well plates. Cells were then lysed and
viability was assessed by measuring endogenous lactate dehydrogenase activity. (b) STF3A cells were plated in 96 well format and wells
were treated with 9.8 nM to 20 mM HQBA±0.5 M equivalents of ferrous ethylenediammonium sulfate tetrahydrate for 18 h. Luciferase
activity in lysates was measured and normalized to endogenous lactate dehydrogenase activity. Dose curves were plotted with
Graphpad Prism (La Jolla, CA, USA). (c) DLD-1 cells were plated in 24-well plates in the presence of the indicated concentration of
FeCl3, and allowed to grow for 24 h. Cells were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline and then incubated with 500 nM
HQBA for an additional 72 h. Viability was measured as described. (d) DLD-1 cells were grown in the presence of 20 mM FeCl3 for 24 h,
washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, and then treated with the indicated concentration of HQBA in dimethyl sulfoxide for an
additional 24 h before lysis and measurement of AXIN2 mRNA levels by quantitative reverse transcriptase–PCR. Data are shown as

explain why we found HQBA induced a remarkable cell
cycle arrest in G1 in some cell types, and induced an
S phase arrest in others (data not shown). An additional
consideration is that HQBA can chelate a number of
other transition metals, although at lower afﬁnity, which
could also contribute to decreased cell proliferation.
Besides their ability to remove iron from key pathways,
the formation of HQBA:Fe (II) complexes can have
additional effects. Chelated iron can participate in
generation of reactive oxygen species, an activity that
contributes to the toxicity of the iron chelator Dp44mT
(Jansson et al., 2010; Tian et al., 2010). In fact, we were
able to detect a signiﬁcant increase in both reactive oxygen
species and reactive nitrogen species in several cell types
treated with HQBA, but unlike with Dp44mT, the
cytotoxicity of HQBA was not consistently rescued by
pre-treatment with the reducing agent N-acetylcysteine nor
with the nitric oxide synthase inhibitor nitro-L-arginine
methyl ester (data not shown). Thus, although HQBA
complexes may be redox active, reactive oxygen species
and reactive nitrogen specie generation was not the cause
of cytotoxicity in the colon cancer lines we tested.
The ability of HQBA to inhibit Wnt/b-catenin
signaling downstream of b-catenin in several colon
Oncogene

cancer cell lines and embryonic tissues suggests that it
also functions at the level of transcription or mRNA
stability. Although iron regulates some transcripts via
message stability (via iron response elements and ironresponsive-element-binding proteins), here we suspect
the effect is transcriptional, as it is cell type speciﬁc,
and affects the artiﬁcial TOPFLASH promoter as well
as several b-catenin-response genes. A number of ironbinding and iron-responsive transcription factors are
known within the iron homeostasis pathways (Rutherford and Bird, 2004), and it is likely that iron and other
metals control gene expression in other pathways.
The sensitivity of colonocytes and Wnt-b-catenin
signaling to iron status has been noted recently. Brookes
et al. (2008) found that several colon cancer cell lines,
including Caco-2, SW480 and LS174 T, have increased bcatenin signaling in response to iron loading as demonstrated by both increase in TOPFLASH and increase
in endogenous c-Myc and NKD gene expression. The
increased baseline level of b-catenin-dependent signaling in
cells with mutations in the APC or b-catenin gene
may make this pathway particularly sensitive to changes
in the abundance of an as yet-unidentiﬁed iron-dependent
co-factor. We note that nuclear iron-dependent enzymes

continue to be discovered; for example, the recently
described mammalian cytosine hydroxymethylase, with
strong tissue-speciﬁc and developmentally controlled
expression, is an Fe (II)-containing enzyme (Tahiliani
et al., 2009). Similarly, the iron-containing transcription
factor, pirin, interacts with nuclear factor 1 and Bcl-3
(Pang et al., 2004). A b-catenin-dependent tissue-speciﬁc
transcriptional regulator might be a particularly useful
target for the treatment of APC-mutant cancers.
HQBA differs from the iron chelators, such as
deferoxamine, used clinically to treat iron overload
both in its cell permeability and its high selectivity for
Fe2 þ over Fe3 þ (Table 3). Structure–activity studies
indicate that the antiproliferative potential of iron
chelators increases with increasing hydrophobicity
(Hodges et al., 2004). This trend is thought to correlate
with increasing ability of more hydrophobic chelators to
enter the cell in which they have access to critical
metalloenzymes and pools of stored iron. This notion is
consistent with the high-calculated log P of HQBA,
suggesting it is highly cell permeable. Antiproliferative
capability also directly correlates with redox potential.
Molecules such as deferoxamine, a hexadentate chelator
of Fe3 þ , fully occupy the coordination sphere of iron,
rendering it inaccessible to oxygen and reducing the
formation of reactive oxygen species. Bidentate and
tridentate chelators by contrast permit such interactions,
and, therefore, may permit or even facilitate redox
cycling of bound iron. Redox cycling and reactive
oxygen species generation could therefore have a role in
HQBA anti-cancer activity in some cell types.
The ultimate effectiveness of iron chelation as an anticancer strategy remains unclear. In part, this is because
existing iron chelators are far from equivalent to each
other in biological effects. In addition to differences in
in vivo clearance rates, various iron chelators in clinical
trials differ in their cell permeability, redox potential
and potentially, ability to pull iron out of various
iron-dependent enzymes and other intracellular pools
of stored iron, as well as differences in side targets. The
structure–activity relationship studies of desferrithiocin
illustrate how dramatically iron chelators can differ
(Bergeron et al., 1993, 1999). Desferrithiocin is an
effective iron chelator with the adverse side effect of
nephrotoxicity. Removal of a single methyl group
abrogated the nephrotoxicity. Iron clearance in a rat
model was unaffected, but was signiﬁcantly reduced in a
primate model. Other analogs, which replaced a pyridyl
nitrogen with a carbon, were found to elicit severe
gastrointestinal toxicity in rats (Bergeron et al., 1999).
Genetically engineered mouse models of cancer, while
more difﬁcult experimentally, are more predictive of
whether a drug will have efﬁcacy in humans than the
easier xenograft models in immunocompromised mice.
The ability of HQBA to block cancer progression
without inducing weight loss supports the hypothesis
that spontaneous cancers, even in chow-fed, iron-replete
mice, are exquisitely sensitive to iron depletion. In
addition, there may be additional properties of the
intracellular HQBA:Fe (II) complexes that contribute to
their anti-cancer activity.

Materials and methods
Reagents
A 50 000 compound library, as well as 5839152/HQBA,
and related compounds were purchased from Chembridge.
HQBA was re-synthesized, and derivatized versions were
synthesized at the Duke University Small Molecule Synthesis
Facility. Antibodies to axin2 were from Cell Signaling
(Danvers, MA, USA). Antibodies to HIF-1a, b-catenin, bactin and b-tubulin were from Abcam (Cambridge, MA,
USA). The screen for Wnt3A inhibitors has been recently
described (Coombs et al., 2010). For isothermal titration
calorimetry experiments, most metals (Fe3 þ , Cu2 þ , Co2 þ ,
Al3 þ , Ni2 þ , Zn2 þ ) used were obtained as atomic absorption
standards in nitric acid from Aldrich (St Louis, MO, USA).
Fe2 þ was obtained as 2,20 -bipyridine ferrous perchlorate from
GFS Chemicals (Powell, OH, USA). Glycine and acetohydroxamic acid were obtained from Aldrich.
Screen for Wnt3A inhibitors
HEK293 cells with stably integrated luciferase driven by 8X
Super TopFlash promoter and stable expression of Wnt3A
were incubated with 10 mM compound for 16–20 h.
Western blotting
Cells were treated with control or compound for times
indicated and lysates were run on 10% SDS–polyacrylamide
gel electrophoresis. Proteins were transferred to ImmobilonFL (Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA) polyvinylidene ﬂuoride
membranes and blocked with either 5% bovine serum albumin
in phosphate-buffered saline þ 0.05% Tween 20 for detection
of proteins by enhanced chemiluminescence, or with Sea Block
(Pierce, Rockford, IL, USA) for ﬂuorescent detection strategies. Primary antibody dilutions are 1:1000 for all antibodies
except HIF-1a (1:2000), b-catenin (1:6000) and b-tubulin
(1:15 000). Secondary antibodies are diluted to 1:5000 for
detection by enhanced chemiluminescence, and 1:10 000 for
ﬂuorescence detection.
Determination of lethal dose 50 values in cancer cell lines
Cells were plated at 4000 cells/well in clear 96-well plates, and
allowed to adhere overnight. Media was then exchanged for
fresh and HQBA was added at concentrations ranging from 9
to 50 mM. After 72 h cells were washed in phosphate-buffered
saline and lysed in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.6%
Igepal CA-630 (Sigma-Aldrich). Relative cell density/well was
then determined by assaying endogenous lactate dehydrogenase activity. Lethal dose 50 values were obtained from
nonlinear analysis using Prism. Assays were also conducted
in which cells were plated at 2000 cells/well and incubated with
HQBA for 7 days (168±4 h). In these assays, media and
compound were refreshed every 72 h. In both long and short
assays, assays were performed in triplicate.
Microarray and CMAP analysis
MCF7 cells were plated at 70–80% conﬂuence in six-well plates
and allowed to adhere overnight before incubation with dimethyl
sulfoxide or 4 mM HQBA for 6 h. RNA was then isolated using
RNeasy puriﬁcation kit from Qiagen (Germantown, MD, USA).
Labeled complementary RNA was prepared and hybridized to
Affymetrix (Santa Clara, CA, USA) U133_Plus_2.0 microarrays
according to the manufacturer’s protocols. Gene expression
signatures were analyzed using the Connectivity Map web tool
(build 02), found at http://www.broad.mit.edu/cmap/. Full

HQBA inhibits b-catenin signaling and proliferation
GS Coombs et al

Small interfering RNA experiments
Cells were plated at 50% conﬂuence in 6 or 12 well format,
transfected next day with control (non-targeting) or small
interfering RNAs targeting b-catenin and incubated for 48
(si b-catenin) or 72 h. Sequences of small interfering RNAs
used are 50 -UAGCGACUAAACACAUCAA-30 (control),
50 -GAUCCUAGCUAUCGUUCUU-30 (b-catenin 09) and
50 -GCGUUUGGCUGAACCAUCA-30 (b-catenin 11).
Quantitative PCR
For quantitation of mRNA, cells were treated as indicated.
RNA was then isolated using an RNeasy puriﬁcation kit from
Qiagen. Generation of complementary DNA was performed
according to manufacturer’s instructions using the iscript
complementary DNA synthesis kit from Biorad (Hercules,
CA, USA). Quantitative PCR reactions were then built using
IQ-Sybr Green kit or Ssofast Evagreen Supermix from
BioRad. Primers are listed in Supplementary Table 1. Cycling
was carried out in an iQ5 model icycler (BioRad).
Metal chelation analysis by spectrophotometry
Chelation of metals by HQBA and related compounds was
evaluated by mixing 10–50 mM compound with 0.5–40 mM metal,
and diluting 1000-fold in H2O in a quartz cuvette. Absorbance
spectra over the range 210–550 nM were obtained on a U-2810
spectrophotometer (Hitachi, Pleasanton, CA, USA).
Drug treatment in MMTV-Wnt1 and MMTV-PyMT mouse
models of mammary carcinogenesis
MMTV-Wnt1 and MMTV-PyMT female virgin mice ranging
from 6 to 20 weeks old were added to either control or treatment
arms of the study, as they presented with palpable mammary
tumors. Mice in the treatment arm were injected intraperitoneally
every morning with 9 or 70 mg/kg drug prepared as follows:
HQBA was dissolved to 100 mM in dimethyl sulfoxide and 6–
10 ml/mouse was added to 200 ml of vehicle. For studies of
MMTV-Wnt1 mice, vehicle was 200 ml of pure olive oil. For the
MMTV-PyMT mouse studies, vehicle was 5% cremophor, 22%
(2-hydroxypropyl)-b-cyclodextrin in 0.9% sterile saline. Mice in
the control arm were injected intraperitoneally daily with 200 ml
of vehicle only. Mice were weighed daily before injection and
their tumors measured post injection with calipers. Tumor
volumes were calculated using the formula for volume of an
ellipsoid: (½ (short dimension))2  long dimension (Tomayko
and Reynolds, 1989). Change in tumor volume is plotted relative
to starting volume, which is normalized to 100% for each tumor.
Chick neural tube explant assays
Neural explants encompassing midbrain to rhombomere 2 tissue
were isolated from Hamburger and Hamilton stage 10 embryos as
previously described and cultured overnight until explants
corresponded to Hamburger and Hamilton stage 16. Explants
were embedded in collagen to maintain morphology and 1 mM
HQBA and 0.5 mM Fe2 þ were supplemented in the media as
indicated. Double in situ hybridization for Wnt1 and Fgf8 were
performed as described (Canning et al., 2007; Coombs et al., 2010)

Isothermal titration calorimetry
ITC data were collected on a VP-ITC titration microcalorimeter (Microcal Inc., Northampton, MA, USA); details of
instruments and data reduction have been reported elsewhere
(DiTusa et al., 2001). The cell volume of the calorimeter is
1.4346 ml. All protein and metal ligand solutions were
degassed under vacuum before titrations. Samples consisted
of HQBA (1–20 mM) in 10 mM phosphate buffer, pH 6.80, with
buffer as the reference. After cell equilibrium was reached,
a 100–500 mM solution of metal (ZnNO3, CuNO3, NiNO3, Fe
(bipy)3, AlNO3, FeNO3 or CoNO3) in the same buffer
was injected using an injection schedule of 20–60 injections,
5–30 ml volumes, during 10–60 s and at 5–10 min intervals. All
measurements were made at 25 1C. Data analysis was carried
out using the ORIGIN software from Microcal. All binding
enthalpies are reported after subtraction of the appropriate
enthalpy of metal ion dilution.
Displacement titrations were conducted for Cu, Fe (II) and
Fe (III) to ensure stability of the respective metal at the
relevant oxidation state. Metals were pre-incubated with an
appropriate chelator (Cu: glycine, Fe (II): bipy, Fe (III):
acetohydroxamic acid) before titration. Displacement experiments were conducted as described above and data was
analyzed according to the method of Sigurskjold (2000).
During analysis of Fe (II) afﬁnity, Fe (bipy)3 was added to the
sample cell and a solution of HQBA was injected under the
identical conditions described above.
Job plots: Co2 þ , Cu2 þ , Ni2 þ , Fe3 þ , Fe2 þ , Al3 þ
Solutions (500 mmol) containing varying ratios of 9152 and the
appropriate metal in 1:1 MeOH/phosphate buffer (pH 6.80)
were analyzed by ultraviolet/visible spectroscopy. The day to
day transition was measured in absorbance units and plotted
as mole fraction of metal versus absorbance at the appropriate
wavelength after adjustment for residual metal absorbance.
The job plot for zinc was measured by difference spectroscopy.
