BACKGROUND. The incidence of multiple myeloma (MM) is lower in Asia than in
western countries. However, no data are available on descriptive epidemiology of
MM in Chinese.

METHODS. From 1979 to 2003, 3602 MM patients were registered in the Taiwan
National Cancer Registry. The annual incidence and mortality were calculated
and age-standardized to the world standard population in the year 2000. Age-period-cohort effects on incidence were analyzed. The salient clinical data of 526
MM patients in a single institute were also investigated.

RESULTS. From 1979 to 2003, the average age-adjusted incidence per 100,000
population was 0.75. The incidence increased with age to a peak of 5.2 in those
aged 7579 years. In addition to age, remarkable period and birth cohort effects

tality also increased, which accounted for an average of 0.59 per 100,000 deaths;
however, the fatality rate was steady at 80%. Clinical and laboratory characterisreported elsewhere. Remarkably, extramedullary myeloma (extra-MM) at diagnosis was more common in patients younger than 55 years of age than in others

CONCLUSIONS. Incidence of MM in Taiwan has dramatically increased in recent
ences in treatment outcome between MM patients in Taiwan and in other countries. However, prevalence of extra-MM is higher in patients younger than
55 years of age. Cancer 2007;110:896905.  2007 American Cancer Society.

ultiple myeloma (MM) is a clonal plasma-cell neoplasm characterized by proliferation in the bone marrow (BM) of neoplastic plasma cells that impair hematopoiesis, activate osteoclastic
bone resorption, and secrete a monoclonal paraprotein (M-protein)
in serum and/or urine.1 MM accounts for about 1% of human neoplasms, almost 2% of deaths due to cancers, and 12%15% of all
cases of hematological malignancy.2,3
The etiology of MM is unknown. Epidemiologic data suggest that
age, genetic factors, chronic antigenic stimulation, and some environmental or occupational factors may play a role in pathogenesis of
MM.1 Intriguingly, the variation in worldwide incidence is much
greater for MM than for other hematologic malignancies.4 The
reported age-adjusted incidence per 100,000 population of MM
around the world is 0.5 in Hawaiian Japanese men, 0.93.3 in most
European countries, and 8.2 in San Francisco Bay Area black men.57

MM in Taiwan/Huang et al.

The incidence of MM is much lower in the Chinese of
Shanghai and Singapore than in the Caucasian populations of North America and Europe.2,5 During the
past several decades, the incidence of MM has
increased in certain parts of the world,711 while it
appears to have reached a plateau or even declined in
some areas of the USA and UK since the 1990s.1214
This dissimilarity has been the subject of considerable
interest, and reasons for this rise in incidence of MM
in these countries remain unclear.
To formulate a new etiologic hypothesis or to elucidate the mechanism for the inter-racial differences in
incidence of MM, analyses of both the changes in MM
geographic distribution and incidence over time may be
helpful. Age-period-cohort (APC) analysis is commonly
used by epidemiologists to analyze trends of disease
incidence and mortality and to help develop hypotheses.15,16 The age effect reflects physiologic differences
between age groups in susceptibility to a given disease.
The calendar time-period effect usually reflects factors
that affect all age groups equally during a given period,
such as introduction of new diagnostic or therapeutic
techniques, and improvement in completeness of data
registration. The birth cohort represents a population
born into a specified generation. If disease incidence is
affected by the birth cohort, then the term birth-cohort
effect is used, which may involve factors that differentially affect birth cohorts because of differences in
exposure levels, such as life style, risk, or protective
factors.1517 APC analysis is designed to estimate the
effect of patients’ age as well as individual effects of factors, such as time at diagnosis and patients’ birth cohort,
which are usually overlooked in cross-sectional studies.15,16 At present, available data dealing with descriptive epidemiology of MM is mainly from western
countries,15 and MM in Chinese has not been studied
comprehensively. Moreover, APC analysis has rarely
been used to analyze trends of MM incidence.
Our aims were to present descriptive epidemiology of MM in Taiwan, a country inhabited by 20 million Chinese located in the southeastern Asia, and to
provide key epidemiological data in this population.
The potential effects of patient age, calendar time
period at diagnosis, and birth cohort on the change
in incidence of MM in Taiwan for the past 25 years
were examined. In addition, the salient clinical data
of MM patients in one of the largest medical centers
in Taiwan were investigated and reported herein.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Population
From 1979 to 2003, Taiwan had an average of 20 million inhabitants (men, 52%; women, 48%; almost

897

exclusively Chinese), and the proportion of its aged
population (older than 65 years) increased from 4%
to 9%. In the year 2003, the life span of men and
women was 73 years and 79 years, respectively.18

Cancer Registry
Hospitals island-wide are required to notify the Taiwan National Cancer Registry (TNCR), which was
founded in 1979, of all new cases of cancer. This registry includes approximately 80% of all cancer cases
in Taiwan.19 During the years 1979 to 2003, MM was
coded according to the International Classification of
Diseases for Oncology (ICD-O; World Health Organization, Geneva, Switzerland, 1976). The 1st Edition
(ICD-O-1; 19791990), then the Field Trial Edition
(ICD-O; 19912001), and the recent 3rd Edition
(ICD-O; 20022003) coded MM as M-9730/3, M9730/3, and M-9731/3-9734/3, respectively. MM mortality was coded as 203.00 by the ICD version 9
throughout the study period. Data for newly diagnosed cases and certified deaths due to MM were
obtained from the Taiwan National Cancer Registry.
Data for newly diagnosed cases of other hematological malignancies, including non-Hodgkin lymphoma
(NHL) (ICD-O M-9590/3-9594/3, M-9670/3-9704/3),
Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) (ICD-O M-9650/3-9667/3),
acute myeloid leukemia (AML) (ICD-O M-9861/3, M9862/3, M-9866/3), acute lymphoblastic leukemia
(ALL) (ICD-O M-9821/3, M-9824/3), chronic myeloid
leukemia (CML) (ICD-O M-9863/3) and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) (ICD-O M-9823/3) were
also obtained for comparison.

University Hospital Patients
From 1966 to 2005, the data of 526 patients with MM
diagnosed and/or treated at the National Taiwan
University Hospital (NTUH) were analyzed. Criteria
for diagnosis and staging of MM were defined
according to Durie and Salmon.20,21 All patients’ laboratory reports were reviewed by our staff to verify
diagnosis and staging of MM. Plasma cell leukemia
(PCL) was defined as previously described.21 Patients
with monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance, systemic amyloidosis, or other conditions
associated with a monoclonal gammopathy, as
defined previously,21 were excluded. Moreover, these
hospital patients were grouped into 2 age strata: a
group of ages 55 years and a group of ages [55
years. The cutoff of 55 years was chosen because this
is the age limit for high-dose chemotherapy followed
by autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HDC/ASCT) at this center.

Treatment and Treatment Response
Among the 526 university hospital patients, 446
(85%) were treated with MP (melphalan and prednisolone), or CP (cyclophosphamide and prednisolone),
or VAD (vincristine, doxorubicin, and dexamethasone), as described previously22; the other 80 (15%)
were not chemotherapy recipients. Among recipients
of chemotherapy, 30 also received HDC/ASCT.
Criteria for treatment response were defined by
EBMT (European Group for Blood and Marrow
Transplant) guidelines.23 Progression-free survival
(PFS) was defined as the interval between initial
obtainment of at least minimal response (MR) or
better and documented relapse or progression. Overall survival (OS) was defined as the period between
the date of diagnosis and the date of death for any
reason.

Statistics
Age-specific, sex-specific, and calendar year-specific
incidence and mortality were estimated by using the
number of newly diagnosed and mortality cases,
respectively, in each age, sex, and calendar-year
group as the numerator, with corresponding annual
resident midyear population as denominators.18 Fatality rate (percentage) was 100 times the mortality
divided by the corresponding incidence. The values
of incidence and mortality were expressed as rates
per 100,000 persons, and these rates were adjusted
for age by the direct method on the basis of the
world standard population in the year 2000.17
These annual data were averaged into 5 5-year
time periods (from 19791983 to 19992003). Data
from patients younger than 30 years and older than
85 years were omitted because of the low case number. For the APC analysis, data were categorized into
11 5-year age groups (3034 years to 8084 years)
and 5 5-year time periods (from 19791983 to

19992003), suggesting 15 overlapping 9-year birthcohort groups (from midyear 1899 to 1969).
The chi-square or Fisher exact tests were used
for between-group comparison of discrete variables.
The 2-sample Student t test was used for betweengroup comparison of means. Kaplan-Meier survival
curves were used for estimation of PFS and OS. On
survival analysis, those patients who had received
HDC/ASCT were analyzed separately. All directional
P values were 2-tailed, with a P  0.05 considered
significant for all tests. All analyses were performed
by SPSS 11.0 software (SPSS Institute, Chicago, Ill).

RESULTS
Incidence
From 1979 to 2003, a total of 3602 MM patients,
including 2328 (65%) men and 1274 (35%) women
were registered in the Taiwan National Cancer Registry, and the average incidence was 0.75. The average
age-specific and sex-specific incidence of MM for 2
10-year periods, 19791988 and 19942003, is summarized in Table 1.
For both sexes, the average incidence in
19791983 and 19992003 was 0.36 and 1.21,
respectively (Fig. 1A), whereas that in men was 0.46
and 1.48, respectively (Fig. 1B), and that in women
was 0.25 and 0.93, respectively (Fig. 1C). For comparison, the average incidence of other hematologic
malignancies during the study period is also shown
in Figure 1. For both sexes, the fold increase in incidence of MM and other hematologic malignancies
(between 19791983 and 19992003) was greatest
for MM (3.4 fold), followed by CLL (3.3), NHL (3.2),
CML (1.7), AML (1.6), ALL (1.5), and HL (1.4) (Fig.
1A). In 2003, MM accounted for approximately 1% of
all cancers in Taiwan, and the incidence of MM
exceeded that of ALL, especially in men. Therefore
MM is now the third most common hematologic

malignancy in Taiwan, just behind NHL and AML
(Fig. 1). From 1979 to 2003, the sex ratio (M:W) of
incidence of MM decreased gradually from 3.6:1 to
1.5:1, with an average of 1.8:1. The decrease in sex
ratio was quite steady in all age groups.
Figure 2 shows the age-period-cohort effects on
MM incidence. In Figure 2A, incidence of MM
increased for all age groups but was greater in
patients 60 years than in those \60. Notably, the
age of peak incidence shifted to the right in later
time periods. In Figure 2B, at any given age, incidence increased linearly over time and more steeply
in the older age groups (70 years). Notably,
between 19841988 and 19891993, the incidence
increased more consistently at any given age than in
other time periods. Figure 2C shows that the incidence was higher for later birth cohorts in every
given age group, and, particularly for those older
than 60 years, incidence rose dramatically in successive birth cohorts.

Mortality and Fatality
The average sex-specific and age-specific mortality
for 2 different calendar periods (19791988 and
19942003) are summarized in Table 2. The average

mortality (19792003) was 0.59 (0.73 for men and
0.42 for women), and the average fatality rate
remained fairly constant (81% for men and 80% for
women). However, for both sexes, the fatality rates
were lowest at ages 3544 years, relatively steady at
ages of 4559 years, gradually increased by age 60
years, and peaked at ages older than 80 years. Interestingly, the fatality rates were also high at ages
3034 years, especially in women (Fig. 3A). Age-specific fatality rates between 19791988 and
19892003 decreased in nearly all age groups, except
in the 5570 years of age group (Fig. 3B).

Clinical Characteristics
Clinical and laboratory features of 526 patients are
summarized in Tables 3 and 4. Up to June 2006, with
a median follow-up of 100 months, 421 (80%)
patients were lost to follow-up because of either
death (347 patients) or other reasons (74 patients).
Among the 347 MM patients who died, the most
common causes of death were pneumonia or sepsis
(57%) and myeloma progression (25%).
Neuropathy was noted in 29 (6%) patients at diagnosis. In this group, compartmental neuropathy
for emerging plasmacytoma occurred in 19 (65%)

patients, and idiopathic polyneuropathy was observed
in 10 (35%) patients. MM was diagnosed in 12 (2 %)
patients with amyloidosis, lytic bone lesions, and
[30% plasma cells in the bone marrow. It was noteworthy that 117 (22%) patients overall had extramedullary manifestations of myeloma (extra-MM),
including plasmacytomas in 92 patients, malignant
effusions in 25 patients, and PCL in 12 patients.
Importantly, on light-chain analysis, kappa-type predominance occurred for all immunoisotypes as would
be expected, except for IgD MM, where 14 of 16
(88%) were lambda in type. Ten patients had bi-clonal
and 1 patient had tri-clonal M-protein production.

Age was 55 years for 164 patients and [55
years for the remaining 362 patients. Clinical features
and laboratory results for the 2 age groups are compared in Tables 3 and 4. The prevalence of extra-MM
at diagnosis was significantly higher in patients ages
55 years than ages [55 years. The mean age was
also significantly lower for those with than without
extra-MM at diagnosis (55.5  14.0 years vs 63.8 
11.8 years, P < .001).

Treatment Response and Outcome

DISCUSSION
To our best knowledge, this is the first report to comprehensively describe the epidemiology of MM in Chinese. We report here an almost 4-fold increase in the
incidence of MM in Taiwan during the past 25 years,
although the overall incidence of MM here is still quite
low compared with that in western countries.17 Of the
incidences of all hematological malignancies, that for
MM has increased the most. These findings are comparable to those of other recent reports.8,24
Reasons for great racial disparity in incidence of
MM are unclear. However, 1 or more genetic factor(s)
is likely to be playing some role. The incidence of
MM is similar in Asian immigrants to the USA and
Australia and in Asians in their countries of birth,
but it is lower than the incidence in those born in
the USA and Australia.2,25 To support the notion of
genetic influence, familial risk of MM has also been

demonstrated.26,27 In addition, a B-allele polymorphism of the tumor-suppressor gene encoding poly(adenoside diphosphate [ADP]-ribose) polymerase has
been reported in patients with MM and monoclonal
gammopathy of unknown significance (MGUS).28 Its
expression was more frequent in US blacks, who
have the highest incidence of MM worldwide, than
in whites.1,29 Notably, frequency of this B-allele polymorphism is much lower in Chinese than in
whites.29 Moreover, frequency of several MM-related
human leukocyte antigens (HLA), such as HLA-B5,
HLA-Cw2, and HLA-C5,27 is also much lower in the
Taiwan general population and in US Asian populations than in other US populations.30,31 Thus, racial
differences in genetic background may partly explain
the lower incidence of MM in Asian countries. However, further studies, particularly in the area of molecular epidemiology, are warranted to uncover the
genetic determinants of MM.
Our data suggested that, in addition to an age
effect, both period and cohort effects contributed to
the increasing trend in incidence of MM. The incidence increased more consistently between 198488

and 198993 at any given age than other time periods, which suggested a dominant period effect during this time period. Multiple factors may be
involved in the period effect, such as improvement
in diagnostic techniques and case ascertainment.12
Interestingly, the use of immunological methods,
such as protein electrophoresis and immunofixation
electrophoresis, became popular in Taiwan during
this time period, supporting this view. Not unlike the
reports of Kyle et al13 and Pollan et al,32 a birthcohort effect on the incidence of MM was observed
in this study. The stronger effect on incidence of MM
in the older birth cohort (before 1934 birth cohort)
indicated that changes in occupational or environmental exposures between patients born in earlier
and later cohorts likely plays some role in the pathogenesis of MM. One of the possibilities is that the
occupations of the older birth cohort, which were
predominantly related to agriculture, were gradually
switched to those of the younger birth cohorts,
which were related to industry. Employment in agriculture has been most frequently associated with
MM.33 Conversely, the prolonged birth-cohort effect
observed in this study suggests that lifestyle or persistence of some environmental pollutants (such as
polychlorinated biphenyls [PCBs], polychlorinated
dibenzo-p-dioxins, and polychlorinated dibenzofurans [PCDFs]) may play a role in the pathogenesis of
MM.34 Intriguingly, results from a global survey of
such pollutants in the muscle of skipjack tuna
showed higher levels in the East and South China
sea, where Taiwan is located.35 Although the relations
among toxins, food sources, environmental pollution,
and increasing incidence of MM are speculative,
these findings provide rationale for further analytical
epidemiology studies to test this hypothesis.
One limitation of the analysis is the difficulty in
differentiating a time-sustained period effect from a
cohort effect. Because it is probable that access to
modern hospital care improved evenly in Taiwan, the
birth-cohort effect reported here could have been
partly influenced by improved detection. However,
the effect of exposures known to be associated with
MM incidence, including radiation, agricultural pesticides, dioxin, and other related herbicides, may have
been more intense for recent birth cohorts. Furthermore, the data shown in Figure 2A may be, in some
degree, suggestive of a time trend in diagnostic bias,
as a result of an historical under-recognition of MM
in the oldest ages, which had steadily lessened and
was largely ameliorated in the most recent calendar
period. Therefore, the consequences of this bias
would be associated with inflation of the overall estimate of increase in MM rates and the appearance of

MM in Taiwan/Huang et al.

a greater increase in rates for the older ages.
Undoubtedly, the age-differential diagnostic bias was
an alternative explanation for the time trend of
increased incidence of MM. However, it is important
to note that the increased rate in older patients ([70
years; Fig. 2A) was more than 10-fold during this 25year period, and this, therefore, seems difficult to
explain by diagnostic bias alone. In addition, the
observed increased incidence of MM in successive
generations at any given age (not limited to older
ages; Fig. 2C) also argues against the improved case
ascertainment to be the only determinant for
increased incidence of MM.
In contrast to other reports,10 sex ratio of MM in
Taiwan decreased gradually from 1979 to 2003; and it
was quite steady in all age groups. Thus, although
MM incidence continued to increase in both genders, MM incidence increased more in women than
in men during this period. The reason is not clear. In
countries with reportedly higher rates of MM, such
as Nordic countries, M:W ratios tend to be higher in
younger than in older age groups, perhaps suggesting
that exposure to occupational factors may affect men
at an earlier age than it does women and lead to an
earlier appearance of MM.36 In contrast, the fixed sex
ratio in nearly all age groups in our data reinforces
the hypothesis that exposure to environmental pollutants rather than occupational factors likely triggers
increased incidence. A survey performed in Taiwan
found higher levels of pollutants (eg, PCBs and
PCDFs) in older than in younger persons and in
women than in men.37 Furthermore, during
19561975, the average proportion of agriculturerelated occupations was not much different between
men and women (40% vs 46%, respectively) registered in our National Labor Data Base (Available at:
http://www.dgbas.gov.tw).
Our study found that, in young age groups, fatality rates were higher in women than in men, and the
reason is not clear. The decreased fatality rates in
nearly all age groups, except those between 55 and
70 years, may reflect improved supportive care and
tumor treatment, such as HDC/ASCT, which has
been shown repeatedly to provide better outcome
than conventional chemotherapy in MM patients,
especially in younger MM patients.38,39 In concordance with this observation, by a risk-adjusted retrospective analysis, our treatment outcome was better
for our MM patients who had undergone HDC/ASCT
than those who had conventional chemotherapy alone.
Although the incidence of MM is low in Taiwan,
the clinical presentations and treatment outcomes of
our MM patients were comparable to those reported
in other countries,40,41 which indicates a common

903

pathogenesis of MM worldwide. Most of our patients
with neuropathy reported numbness on extremities,
and, in part, this was a result of compartmental neuropathy from emerging plasmacytomas. This finding
may explain why patients younger than 55 years had
a higher incidence of neuropathy in this study
because they had higher incidence of extramedullary plasmacytomas than others. Nonetheless, the
reported rate of symptomatic peripheral neuropathy
was significant, and it appeared to be in the range of
approximately 10%, which is somewhat higher that
has previously been seen. The higher incidence of
infections among patients older than 55 years was
probably due to age and some concomitant disorders. Intriguingly, the incidence of extra-MM at diagnosis was significantly higher in patients ages 55
years than in patients ages [55 years. A similar observation has been reported in several cases of MM
in younger patients.42,43 Interestingly, frequent extramedullary relapse after HDC/ASCT has been
reported in Spanish MM patients of median age 53
years, but the underlying mechanism(s) remained
unclear.44 Therefore, studies are needed to elucidate
whether the pathogenesis or clonal evolution of MM
in younger patients is different from that in older
patients. This is of importance, as, clinically, some
emerging treatment strategies and novel drugs, such
as bortezomib, have been shown to be especially
active in such patients with extra-MM.45
In conclusion, the incidence of MM is indeed
lower in Taiwan than in western countries, which
may be because of genetic disparity between races.
The incidence of MM continues to increase, and not
only age and calendar period but also birth cohort is
contributing to this increase. The clinical features
and treatment outcome of our MM patients are similar to those of others. Intriguingly, extra-MM at diagnosis is more prevalent in MM patients younger than
55 years, and reasons for this finding need to be further evaluated.
