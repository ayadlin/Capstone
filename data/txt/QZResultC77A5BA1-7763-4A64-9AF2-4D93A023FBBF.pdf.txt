Abstract
Breast cancers expressing estrogen receptor-A (ERA) are
associated with a favorable biology and are more likely to
respond to hormonal therapy. In addition to ERA, other
pathways of estrogen response have been identified including
ERB and GPR30, a membrane receptor for estrogen, and the
key mechanisms regulating expression of ERs and hormone
response remain controversial. Herein, we show that TFAP2C
is the key regulator of hormone responsiveness in breast
carcinoma cells through the control of multiple pathways of
estrogen signaling. TFAP2C regulates the expression of ERA
directly by binding to the ERA promoter and indirectly
via regulation of FoxM1. In so doing, TFAP2C controls the
expression of ERA target genes, including pS2, MYB, and
RERG. Furthermore, TFAP2C controlled the expression of
GPR30. In distinct contrast, TFAP2A, a related factor expressed
in breast cancer, was not involved in estrogen-mediated
pathways but regulated expression of genes controlling cell
cycle arrest and apoptosis including p21CIP1 and IGFBP-3.
Knockdown of TFAP2C abrogated the mitogenic response to
estrogen exposure and decreased hormone-responsive tumor
growth of breast cancer xenografts. We conclude that TFAP2C
is a central control gene of hormone response and is a novel
therapeutic target in the design of new drug treatments for
breast cancer. [Cancer Res 2007;67(18):8439–43]

Introduction
The prediction of whether a breast cancer will respond to
hormonal therapy is largely dependent on the expression of
estrogen receptor-a (ERa; ref. 1). Whereas normal mammary
epithelial cells express minimal amounts of the receptor (4 fmol/mg
protein), ERa-positive breast cancers commonly overexpress the
receptor by one to three orders of magnitude (2). In addition to
ERa, other signaling pathways for estrogen have been identified in
breast carcinoma cells including ERh (3) and GPR30 (4, 5), a membrane receptor for estrogen. Controversy exists about the contribution of each estrogen signaling pathway to hormone response
and mechanisms controlling expression of ERa and other signaling
pathways are yet to be defined.
Previous studies identified the TFAP2 family as one set of factors
involved in human ERa promoter expression in breast cancer cells
(6, 7). The TFAP2A and TFAP2C proteins are commonly expressed
in breast cancer and overexpression of these factors can upregulate the cloned ERa promoter (7). Furthermore, overexpression

of TFAP2A and TFAP2C can induce a hypersensitive site at the AP2
regulatory region of the ERa promoter in human mammary
epithelial cells (8). However, several critical questions remain to be
addressed. First, it has not been shown whether endogenous TFAP2
factors regulate expression of ERa in breast cancer cells. Second,
it remains a question as to whether TFAP2 factors are key regulators of ERa expression and whether the activity of TFAP2 on ERa
expression is sufficient to have functional effects on hormone
responsiveness. Finally, it is important to determine whether the
various TFAP2 family members differ in their activity with respect
to ERa regulation. To address these questions, we manipulated
endogenous TFAP2 expression in breast carcinoma cell lines and
examined the effects on ERa expression, alternate gene expression
profiles, and physiologic responses to estrogen treatment.

Materials and Methods
Cell lines and culture. All cells were obtained from American Type
Culture Collection. Hormone manipulation was done as described
previously (9) with 10 nmol/L h-estradiol and 10 Amol/L 4-OH-tamoxifen
(Sigma-Aldrich).
Small interfering RNA transfections. Small interfering RNAs (siRNA)
for TFAP2A and TFAP2C were obtained from Dharmacon and used
according to the manufacturer. SMARTpools for TFAP2A and TFAP2C and
single siRNA (TFAP2C1, D-005238-01-0200; TFAP2A5, D-006348-03) were
used with comparable results as the SMARTpools.
Gene expression array analysis. Total RNA was isolated using the
RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen) and subjected to analysis on the Human Genome
U133 Plus 2.0 Arrays (Affymetrix) in conjunction with the DNA Core Facility
at the University of Iowa following the GeneChip Expression Analysis
Technical Manual. ArrayAssist software (Stratagene) implementing the
robust microarray analysis algorithm was used to generate gene expression
values.
Quantitative and semiquantitative reverse transcription-PCR. Gene
expression array results were validated using quantitative real-time PCR
using Taqman gene expression assays, supplied by ABI (Applied Biosystems).
Semiquantitative reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) for ERa and pS2 was
done as described previously (9).
Western blots. Western blots were done using the following antibodies:
TFAP2C 6E4/4, TFAP2A 3B5, actin I-19, ERa HC-20, and pS2 FL-84 (Santa
Cruz Biotechnology) and TFAP2C 6E4/4 05-409, TFAP2A 8G8/5 05-820, and
ERa 60C 05-634 (Upstate/Chemicon).
Cell cycle analysis. Twelve hours after siRNA transfection, cells were
transferred into phenol-free DMEM (Life Technologies, Invitrogen) medium
plus 10% charcoal-stripped fetal bovine serum (Gemini Bio-Products),
with the addition of 5 Amol/L bovine insulin (Sigma-Aldrich) for 48 h, after
which the cells were treated with medium alone or medium containing
h-estradiol or h-estradiol and 4-OH-tamoxifen. After 12 h, cells were harvested, stained with 0.05 mg/mL propidium iodide (Sigma-Aldrich), 0.1%
Triton X-100, and 10 mg/mL sodium citrate, and subjected to fluorescenceactivated cell sorting analysis.
Chromatin immunoprecipitation. Chromatin immunoprecipitation
(ChIP) analysis was done as described previously (10, 11).
Tumor xenografts. Female BALB/c nude mice, 4 to 6 weeks old (Charles
River), were implanted with a 1.7-mg estrogen pellet (Innovative Research)

and 5  106 MCF7 cells transfected with TFAP2C, TFAP2A, or TFAP2C
scrambled siRNA were injected into the mammary fat pad. For visible
tumors, surface area was estimated by measuring with calipers and
reported as 3.14  length / 2  width / 2. For microscopic tumors, volume
was estimated from histologic sections assuming ellipsoid formula (length
 width  depth  0.5233). Immunohistochemical stains for ERa were
done in the University of Iowa Pathology Core.

Results and Discussion
TFAP2C regulates expression of ERA. To test the hypothesis
that endogenous TFAP2 factors are involved in the normal
regulation of ERa expression, ERa-positive MCF7 cells were
transfected with siRNA directed against TFAP2C or TFAP2A and
mRNA was measured by RT-PCR. By 96 h after transfection,
elimination of TFAP2C reduced the level of ERa mRNA to 17% the
level found in mock-transfected cells (Fig. 1A). By comparison,
ERa expression in cells transfected with a siRNA directed against
TFAP2A was not significantly different from mock-transfected cells.
Western blot analysis of ERa and TFAP2C protein showed a dosedependent effect of TFAP2C siRNA transfection with the loss
of ERa expression paralleling the effect on TFAP2C expression

(Fig. 1B). Western blot analysis confirmed that the expression of
ERa protein was reduced to 16% after transfection with TFAP2C
siRNA compared with mock-transfected cells (Fig. 1B and C).
Because MCF7 express relatively low levels of TFAP2A (Fig. 1D),
the lack of an effect of TFAP2A knockdown on ERa expression
might have been due to low endogenous levels of TFAP2A in this
cell line. We examined two other ERa-positive cell lines, T47-D and
ZR75-1, which expressed higher levels of TFAP2A. As shown in
Fig. 1D, knockdown of TFAP2C expression in T47-D and ZR75-1
resulted in a consistent reduction in ERa expression that was
comparable with the reduction seen in MCF7 cells. By contrast to
TFAP2C, knockdown of TFAP2A resulted in a slight increase in ERa
expression. These findings showed that positive regulation of ERa
expression is specific for TFAP2C, which had not been evident in
systems using overexpression of AP2 factors (7).
TFAP2C targets the ERA promoter and induces genes in the
ERA pathway. We propose that TFAP2C regulates expression of
ERa by directly targeting the ERa promoter at the AP2-regulatory
region (8). ChIP was used to investigate the interaction between
TFAP2C and the ERa promoter. As seen in Fig. 2A, ChIP analysis was
done with anti-TFAP2C antibody, which pulled down the regulatory

expression for ERa, TFAP2C, and TFAP2A in

as indicated. Transfection of a TFAP2C

were identical to mock transfection (see
Supplementary Data). For expression of ERa,

region of the human ERa promoter containing the AP2-binding site
in the ERa-positive cell lines MCF7, ZR75-1, and T47-D cells but not
in ERa-negative cell lines HCT116, HBL-100, and MDA-MB-231.
These results are consistent with a model in which TFAP2C directly
targets the AP2 sites in the ERa promoter and is consistent with
earlier studies that identified an interaction between TFAP2C and
the chromatin of the ERa promoter in the AP2 regulatory region (8).
A critical question is whether the loss of ERa caused by TFAP2C
knockdown is significant enough to have functional consequences
for ERa-regulated genes, such as pS2 (12). As shown in Fig. 2B, the
TFAP2C siRNA significantly reduced the level of mRNA for TFAP2C
and ERa. When pS2 mRNA was analyzed in parallel, we found that
knockdown of TFAP2C significantly reduced the expression of pS2
mRNA. We estimate that the expression of pS2 mRNA was reduced
to <5% of mock-transfected cells, which agrees with earlier studies
showing that estrogen treatment resulted in a 20-fold induction of
pS2 mRNA in MCF7 cells (9, 12). Western blot analysis confirmed
that knockdown of TFAP2C expression eliminated pS2 protein
expression (Fig. 2C). By comparison, MCF7 cells treated with
TFAP2A siRNA retained expression of pS2, which showed the
expected repression with 4-OH-tamoxifen.
TFAP2C regulates multiple pathways of estrogen signaling.
We were interested in determining what other genes might be
controlled by TFAP2C, either directly or indirectly, through
regulation of ERa and potentially other signaling pathways.
Furthermore, it was important to determine if TFAP2C controlled
the expression of genes outside of the ERa pathway or if the effect
of TFAP2C was limited to estrogen-responsive genes. We were also
interested in determining what genes might be responsive to
TFAP2A by comparison to knockdown of TFAP2C. To this end, we
did an analysis of the changes in global patterns of gene expression
in MCF7 cells with elimination of either TFAP2C or TFAP2A. The
patterns of gene expression with alteration of TFAP2 activity were
compared with changes in expression induced by estrogen
exposure. A summary of the array data is presented in Fig. 3A,
which was confirmed using quantitative RT-PCR for selected genes
of interest as shown in Fig. 3B. In Fig. 3B, expression of the genes
of interest was also examined with the combination of TFAP2
knockdown and estrogen elimination. Knockdown of TFAP2C
altered the pattern of expression of known ERa-regulated genes,
including MYB (13) and RERG (14), both of which were found to be
appropriately regulated by estrogen exposure. Interestingly, TFAP2C
controlled the expression of several genes outside the estrogenregulated pathways; most prominent among these being GPR30,
FoxM1, several of the cyclin family members, and RAD51. Of
particular significance, the expression of GPR30 was originally
identified in ERa-positive breast cancers (4) and was subsequently
found to be a membrane receptor for estrogen (5, 15). Furthermore,
FoxM1 has been shown recently to contribute to the regulation of
ERa expression in breast cancer (16). In distinct contrast, TFAP2A
controlled expression of genes, such as p21CIP1 , which induces
G1 and G2-S cell cycle arrest (17). Regulation of p21CIP1 by TFAP2
is consistent with previous reports (17) and these data indicate
that control of this cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor was most
notable with knockdown of TFAP2A. TFAP2A was found to regulate
expression of IGFBP-3, which is inversely associated with progression of breast (18) and prostate cancer (19). Furthermore, the
elimination of estrogen induced expression of IGFBP-3 and the
combination of estrogen elimination and TFAP2A knockdown
resulted in an intermediate effect on expression. Another noteworthy finding is the identification of genes, such as PDZK1, which was

Figure 2. TFAP2C binds ERa promoter and controls ERa target gene pS2.
A, ChIP analysis using antibody to TFAP2C shows interaction of endogenous
TFAP2C with the ERa promoter in ERa-positive cell lines (ZR75-1, MCF7, and
T47-D) but not ERa-negative cell lines (HCT116, HBL-100, and MDA-MB-231).
B, RT-PCR was used to examine expression of mRNA for TFAP2C, ERa,
pS2, and actin in untreated cells (Control ), mock transfected (Mock ), or after
transfection with TFAP2C siRNA (TFAP2C ). C, Western blots were used to
examine protein expression of TFAP2C, ERa, pS2, and actin after transfection
with TFAP2A or TFAP2C siRNA in the presence of either 10 nmol/L h-estradiol
(+E2 ) or 10 nmol/L h-estradiol and 10 Amol/L 4-OH-tamoxifen (+E2/4-OH-T ).

regulated by estrogen but was not altered significantly by TFAP2C.
PDZK1 was reported previously to be an estrogen-regulated gene;
however, it was also shown not to be controlled directly by ERa (9).
The lack of an effect on PDZK1 by TFAP2C suggests that PDZK1
either can be regulated by relatively low levels of ERa or may be
regulated by an alternate mechanism of estrogen responsiveness.
TFAP2C controls mitogenic response to estrogen and
estrogen-induced tumor growth. The physiologic effect of
estrogen exposure in hormone-responsive breast cancer is to induce
mitosis and tumor growth. The finding that ERa and GPR30 are
controlled by TFAP2C suggests that mitogenic response to estrogen
would also be affected by TFAP2C knockdown. However, other genes
induced by estrogen (e.g., PDZK1) seemed to be outside the
regulation of TFAP2C and could indicate that elimination of TFAP2C
will fail to alter the physiologic responses to h-estradiol. Hence,
we examined cell cycle response to h-estradiol stimulation in
MCF7 cells transfected with siRNA directed against either TFAP2C
or TFAP2A. As seen in Fig. 4A, MCF7 cells transfected with siRNA
specific for TFAP2A maintained the expected robust mitogenic
response to h-estradiol treatment, which was appropriately
inhibited by 4-OH-tamoxifen. By comparison, the mitogenic
response to treatment with h-estradiol was dramatically blunted
in MCF7 cells transfected with siRNA directed against TFAP2C. This
result shows that knockdown of TFAP2C in MCF7 cells significantly
reduced the ability of the cells to enter S phase in response to
estrogen exposure.
The role of TFAP2C in hormone-responsive tumor growth was
examined using a xenograft model in nude mice. Tumor growth of

MCF7 cells transfected with TFAP2C siRNA was significantly delayed
compared with cells transfected with TFAP2A siRNA (Fig. 4B).
However, by day 56, differences in tumor size was less significant
between the groups and there was noted to be central necrosis in the
tumors derived from TFAP2A siRNA-transfected cells that was not
found in the TFAP2C siRNA-transfected cells (Fig. 4D). At day 56,
all tumors were found to be ERa positive by immunohistochemistry
(Fig. 4D). The results suggest that loss of TFAP2C delayed early
tumor engraftment with subsequent outgrowth of ERa-positive
cells. To assess early tumor engraftment, mice were euthanized
2 weeks after injection and tumor growth was assessed by serial
sections of the injection sites before significant central necrosis was
observed (Fig. 4D). As seen in Fig. 4C, there were significant
differences in tumor size comparing MCF7 cells transfected with
TFAP2C siRNA versus TFAP2C scrambled siRNA (P < 0.02). No
significant differences were observed comparing cells transfected
with scrambled siRNA versus TFAP2A siRNA (P = 0.42).
Conclusion. Herein, we show that TFAP2C controls estrogen
responsiveness in MCF7 breast carcinoma cells through the
regulation of multiple pathways regulating hormone response (see
Supplementary Data for schematic of pathways). In distinct
contrast, TFAP2A had no effects on estrogen-induced S phase and
tumor growth. Interestingly, recent clinical studies of hormonal

treatment of breast cancer patients have shown that aromatase
inhibitors are superior to tamoxifen in objective response, time to
progression, and incidence of contralateral breast cancer (20). The
biological basis for increased effectiveness of aromatase inhibitors
is thought to be due to suppression of local estrogen production
or a potential partial agonist effect of tamoxifen. However, the
superior clinical effectiveness of aromatase inhibitors might also
be explained by alternate mechanisms of estrogen signaling
that are outside the ERa pathway and might not be responsive
to the effects of tamoxifen. The results presented herein show
that TFAP2C mediates estrogenic responses through several
pathways including ERa and GPR30. Hence, TFAP2C may provide
a novel therapeutic target for the development of more effective
hormonal therapy.
