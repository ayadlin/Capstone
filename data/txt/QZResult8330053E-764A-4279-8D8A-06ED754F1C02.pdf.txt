ABSTRACT
Alpha-garactosylceramide (GalCer) has been shown to have anti-tumor effect
in the basic research and clinical studies. However, anti-tumor effect of GalCer is
limited. The administration of GalCer increases the production of IFN-γ which is
involved in the suppression of tumor growth. On the other hand, the enhancement
of IFN-γ production increases immunosuppressive factors such as nitric oxide. This
suppressive action might impair the anti-tumor effect of GalCer. In the present
study, we evaluated the anti-tumor effect of GalCer in the absence of inducible nitric
oxide synthase (iNOS). In lung metastatic model, the number of tumor nodules in
the lung of iNOS-KO mice treated with GalCer was significantly reduced compared
with that of WT mice treated with GalCer. Moreover, L-NAME, which is the inhibitor
for iNOS, enhanced the anti-tumor effect of GalCer in lung metastatic model. The
frequency of CD8+ cells in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid increased in iNOS-KO mice
treated with GalCer. The administration of GalCer increased the frequency of myeloidderived suppressor cells (MDSCs) in the lung from tumor-bearing WT mice, but the
increase of MDSCs in the lung was not induced in iNOS-KO mice. The subcutaneous
tumor experiments revealed that the administration of GalCer in the absence of iNOS
expression significantly enhanced the induction of tumor antigen-specific response.
Finally, our results indicated that the inhibition of iNOS expression could enhance
the therapeutic efficacy of GalCer via the increase of tumor antigen-specific immune
response and the suppression of MDSCs.

INTRODUCTION

not so effective. Therefore, several reports evaluated the
anti-tumor effect of GalCer by the combination with IL-12
or IL-18 [7, 8].
Inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) is an enzyme
that produces nitric oxide (NO) in several situations.
In particular, NO promotes angiogenesis, metastasis,
and immunosuppression in tumor microenvironment
[9]. Various tumor cells can induce NO production
via the up-regulation of iNOS expression, and iNOS
expression is involved in the prognosis of the patient
with any cancer [10, 11]. Previous studies demonstrated
that myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) also
produce NO and suppress the host immune response in
tumor microenvironment [12]. Thus, NO production
contributes to the progression of cancer and it might be
critical to suppress the expression of iNOS for cancer

Alpha-galactosylceramide (GalCer) is identified as
the ligand of Vα14+ natural killer (NK) T cells. Vα14+
NKT cells distinct from mainstream T cells, B cells and
NK cells have been identified. These cells are found
in relative abundance in tissues such as spleen, bone
marrow, thymus, and liver, and are characterized by the
co-expression of NK cell receptors and invariant T cell
receptors encoded by Vα14 and Jα18 gene segments
[1]. Many reports previously demonstrated that the
administration with GalCer induces the anti-tumor activity
via the activation of NKT cells. The activated NKT
cells can secrete various cytokines, and these cytokines
contribute to the GalCer-induced anti-tumor effect in vivo
[2-6]. However, the administration with GalCer alone is

immunotherapy. Recent reports examined that the
administration of GalCer enhanced the iNOS expression
in EAE model [13]. The co-administration with GalCer
and toll like receptor (TLR) agonist extremely enhanced
NO production [14, 15]. Thus, the activation of NKT cells
is effective for anti-tumor immunity via various cytokines,
but is counteracted by the simultaneous induction of iNOS
which has immunosuppressive effect in tumor-bearing
animals. In the present study, we addressed the hypothesis
that the inhibition of iNOS activity during cancer therapy
using GalCer will enhance the tumor antigen-specific host
immune response to inhibit tumor growth. We were able to
show that the administration of GalCer and simultaneous
inhibition of iNOS activity promote the tumor antigenspecific immune response, leading to the suppression of
established lung metastasis and subcutaneous tumor model
in vivo.

Figure1A, iNOS mRNA expression was increased in the
lung of tumor-bearing WT mice after GalCer injection
(P < 0.05). We next examined the mRNA expression of
iNOS in CD11b+ cells of tumor-bearing WT mice (Figure
1B). CD11b+ cells were magnetically collected from
bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) of tumor-bearing
mice by MACS system. The iNOS mRNA expression of
CD11b+ cells in BALF was extremely up-regulated by the
administration with GalCer (P < 0.05).

Anti-tumor effect of GalCer was enhanced by the
suppression of iNOS activity in lung metastasis
models
B16F10 cells and C26 cells were intravenously
injected to WT or iNOS-KO mice to establish lung
metastasis models. Tumor nodules in the lung could
be confirmed at 5 days after the administration with
tumor cells (data not shown). GalCer (2 μg/mouse) was
intraperitoneally administered into B16F10 cells-bearing
WT and iNOS-KO mice 7 days after the inoculation of
tumor cells. Seven days after GalCer injection, mice were
killed, and their lungs were removed to count superficial
metastatic nodules (Figure 2A). The number of nodules
in the lung was significantly reduced in iNOS-KO mice
treated with GalCer (P < 0.05). NG-nitro-L-arginine methyl
ester (L-NAME) is an iNOS inhibitor; hence, we used this
agent to substantiate data obtained from iNOS-KO mice.
WT mice were orally administered with L-NAME at 0 or 2
mg/ml in drinking water for 1 day before GalCer injection.
The co-administration with GalCer and L-NAME

RESULTS
Up-regulation of iNOS expression after the
administration with GalCer
GalCer have been recently used for cancer
therapy in basic and clinical research. Although the
administration with GalCer enhances the host immune
response, immunosuppressive factors, including iNOS, are
simultaneously induced by GalCer. We first examined the
iNOS expression in lung of B16 F10 cells-bearing mice
after intraperitoneal injection with GalCer. As shown in

Figure 1: Up-regulation of iNOS expression after GalCer administration in tumor-bearing mice. B16F10 cells (3 × 105/

mouse) were intravenously administered to WT mice. WT mice were intraperitoneally injected with GalCer (2 μg/mouse) at 7 days after the
inoculation of tumor cells. A. The relative expression levels of iNOS mRNA in the lung of tumor-bearing mice treated with GalCer were
measured by real-time RT-PCR. B. CD11b+ cells were magnetically isolated from BALF, and iNOS mRNA expression of CD11b+ cells
were measured by real-time RT-PCR. The results were normalized to the expression of 18S rRNA. Each value is shown as mean and SEM
for three mice. * indicates statistically significant differences.

significantly decreased the number of tumor nodules in
the lung (P < 0.05) (Figure 2B). Next, we examined the
effect of GalCer and L-NAME on the different lung tumor
model. C26 cells were inoculated to WT mice, and GalCer

and L-NAME were administered into C26 tumor-bearing
mice. The co-administration with GalCer and L-NAME
significantly reduced the number of tumor nodules in C26
lung tumor model (P < 0.05) (Figure 2C).

Figure 2: Inhibition of iNOS expression enhanced the anti-tumor effect of GalCer on lung metastatic cancer model.
A. B16F10 cells (3 × 105/mouse) were intravenously administered to WT and iNOS-KO mice on day 0. Tumor-bearing mice were
intraperitoneally injected with GalCer (2 μg/mouse) at 7 days after the inoculation of tumor cells. Mice were killed at 7 days after the
injection of GalCer, and their lungs were removed to count superficial metastatic nodules. The number of superficial metastatic lung
tumor was significantly decreased in iNOS-KO mice treated with GalCer (P < 0.05). B. B16F10 cells (3 × 105/mouse) were intravenously
administered to WT mice on day 0. WT mice were administered with L-NAME orally at 2 mg/ml in drinking water for 1 days before and
7 days after GalCer injection. Mice were killed at 7 days after the injection of GalCer. The number of superficial metastatic lung tumor
was significantly reduced in mice with L-NAME and GalCer (P < 0.05). C. CT26 cells (2 × 105/mouse) were intravenously administered
to WT mice on day 0. The mice were orally administered L-NAME in drinking water at 6 days after tumor injection, and intraperitoneally
injected with GalCer 1 day later. Mice were killed at 7 days after the injection of GalCer. The number of superficial metastatic lung tumor
was significantly reduced in mice with L-NAME and GalCer (P < 0.05). Each value is shown as mean and SEM for 4-6 mice.

cells in iNOS-KO mice treated with GalCer was decreased
compared to that in WT mice treated with GalCer. There
was no difference between WT and iNOS-KO mice
treated with GalCer in the ratio of CD4+ cells. Moreover,
CFSE-based T cell suppression assay revealed that the
proliferation of CFSE-labeled CD3+ cells co-cultured
with BALF cells from GalCer-treated WT mice was more
suppressed compared with those from non-treated WT
mice or GalCer-treated iNOS mice (Figure 3B).

We next measured the frequency of CD4+, CD8+,
and CD11b+/Ly6G+ cells in BALF of tumor-bearing WT
and iNOS-KO mice at 3 day after GalCer administration.
As shown in Figure 3A, the frequency of CD8+ cells was

expression in the lung of tumor-bearing WT and
IDO-KO mice treated with GalCer

Effect of GalCer injection on subcutaneous
primary tumors in WT and iNOS-KO mice
We next examined the anti-tumor effect of GalCer
in WT and iNOS-KO mice using subcutaneous tumor
models. EG7 cells were inoculated in to the right flank of
WT and iNOS-KO mice, and GalCer was intraperitoneally
injected when the tumor size grew to approximately 5 mm
in diameter. The administration with GalCer significantly
impaired the growth of subcutaneous tumor in iNOS-KO
mice (P < 0.05) (Figure 5A). To clarify the mechanism
by which GalCer injection promotes anti-tumor effect in
iNOS-KO mice, cells were isolated from tumor DLN of
mice bearing subcutaneous EG7 tumor. The DLN cells
were cultured ex vivo with the OVA SIINFEKL peptide,
which is a CD8-restricted epitope expressed by EG7.
DLN cells from tumor-bearing WT and iNOS-KO mice

IFN-γ and FasL are critical on the establishment
of anti-tumor immunity. Moreover, CCL2 and CXCL9
are involved in the chemoattractant of T cells [16, 17].
Next, we measured mRNA levels for IFN-γ, FasL,
CCL2, and CXCL9 in the lung from tumor-bearing WT
and iNOS-KO mice after GalCer administration (Figure
4). The mRNA expression of IFN-γ, FasL, and CXCL9
significantly increased in iNOS-KO mice at 3 days after
GalCer administration. Although the expression of CCL2
mRNA was up-regulated in WT and iNOS-KO mice after
the administration with GalCer, there was no difference
between WT and iNOS-KO mice in the expression of
CCL2 mRNA after GalCer injection (Figure 4).

Figure 4: The mRNA expression of IFN-γ, FasL, and CXCL9 in the lung from tumor-bearing iNOS-KO mice was
up-regulated after GalCer administration. B16F10 cells (3 × 105/mouse) were intravenously administered to WT mice on day 0.

WT mice were intraperitoneally injected with GalCer at day 7 after the inoculation of tumor cells. The relative expression levels of IFN-γ,
FasL, CCL2, and CXCL9 mRNA in the lung of WT and iNOS-KO mice treated with GalCer were measured using real-time RT-PCR. The
results were normalized to the expression of 18S rRNA. Each data point and error bar represent the mean and SEM, respectively, of data

treated with GalCer responded to stimulation by OVA
peptide by secreting IFN-γ. As shown in Figure 5B, the
number of spot significantly increased by the stimulation
with OVA peptide in DLN cells from iNOS-KO mice
treated with GalCer (P < 0.05). Moreover, we examined
the EG7-specific lysis caused by CD8+ T cells in DLN
cells from WT and iNOS-KO mice treated with GalCer ex
vivo (Figure 5c). Specific cytotoxicity of CD8+ T cells to
EG7 cells in DLN cells from the iNOS-KO mice treated
with GalCer was significantly increased compared to
that from WT mice treated with GalCer (P < 0.05). We
measured the expression of IFN-γ mRNA in DLN of WT
and iNOS-KO mice at 3 days after GalCer administration
(Figure 5D). The expression of IFN-γ mRNA in iNOSKO mice was significantly increased after GalCer

administration compared with that in WT mice. In the
tumor, the frequency of CD8+ cells in iNOS-KO mice
was significantly increased after GalCer administration
compared to that in WT mice (P < 0.05) (Figure 6A).
On the other hand, the frequency of CD11b+/Ly6G+
cells in the tumor of iNOS-KO mice treated with GalCer
decreased compared to that of WT mice (P < 0.05). In
CFSE-based T cell suppression assay, the proliferation
of CFSE-labeled CD3+ cells co-culture with CD11b+
cells from GalCer-treated WT mice was significantly
suppressed compared with those from non-treated WT
mice and GalCer-treated iNOS mice (Figure 6B).

Figure 5: Inhibition of iNOS expression enhanced the anti-tumor effect of GalCer in a subcutaneous tumor model. EG7

cells (1 × 106/mouse) were subcutaneously inoculated into the flank of WT and iNOS-KO mice on day 0. After the tumors became palpable,
the mice were intraperitoneally injected with GalCer (2 μg/mouse). A. Data show the mean ± SEM increase in tumor size 6-8 mice per
group, from two experiments. B. DLN in tumor-bearing WT and iNOS-KO mice were isolated 7 days after GalCer intraperitoneal injection.

GalCer (P < 0.05). C. Isolated effector cells (CD8+ T cells) from DLN of WT and iNOS-KO mice treated with GalCer were incubated for 6
h with CFSE-labeled EG7 at an effector to target cell ratio of 20 to 1. Each data point and error bar represent the mean and SE, respectively,
of results for triplicate samples. D. The relative expression of IFN-γ mRNA in DLN of WT and iNOS-KO mice treated with GalCer was
measured using real-time RT-PCR. The results were normalized to the expression of 18S rRNA. The expression of IFN-γ mRNA was
significantly increased in iNOS-KO mice treated with GalCer (P < 0.05).

DISCUSSION

mRNA was also enhanced in iNOS-KO mice treated
with GalCer (Figure 4). CXCL9 is known as the T-cell
chemoattractant, which is induced by IFN-γ. The upregulation of CXCL9 in the lung might be involved in
the increase of CD8+ cells in BALF of tumor-bearing
iNOS-mice treated with GalCer. Moreover, we found
that the frequency of CD11b+/Ly6G+ cells in iNOS-KO
mice treated with GalCer was lower than that in WT mice
treated with GalCer (Figures 3A and 6A). MDSCs are
broadly defined as CD11b+/Ly6G+ cells. Several previous
reports demonstrated that MDSCs were involved in the
impairment of host immune systems at tumor-bearing
animals [28, 29]. Recent studies demonstrated that iNOS
enhanced the recruitment and induction of functional
MDSCs [30, 31]. The present data also indicated that
the frequency of MDSCs in the tumor was significantly
decreased in iNOS-KO mice compared to that in WT
mice. Moreover, CFSE-based proliferation assay revealed
that BALF cells and CD11b+ cells from GalCer-treated
WT mice had an ability to suppress the proliferation of
T cells (Figures 3B and 6B). These suppressions were
reduced in BALF cells and CD11b+ cells from GalCertreated iNOS-KO mice. The absent of iNOS activity failed
the induction of functional MDSCs after the treatment
of GalCer. The decrease of functional MDSCs might be
involved in the enhancement of anti-tumor effect in iNOSKO mice treated with GalCer.
The inhibition of iNOS activity also enhanced the
anti-tumor effect in subcutaneous tumor model (Figure
5A). ELISPOT assay revealed that tumor antigen-specific
immune response was significantly increased in iNOS-KO
mice treated with GalCer (Figure 5B). Moreover, CD8+
cells in DLN of GalCer-treated iNOS-KO mice extremely
had the tumor specific cytotoxicity. The expression of
IFN-γ in DLN also increased in iNOS-KO mice treated
with GalCer (Figure 5C). These results indicated that
the inhibition of iNOS expression enhanced the tumor
antigen-specific immune response after the administration
of GalCer. Recent study demonstrated that the inhibition
of iNOS activity enhanced the anti-tumor effect of TLR7
agonist in subcutaneous tumor model [32]. Similarly,
the anti-tumor effect of GalCer was enhanced by the
inhibition of iNOS activity in subcutaneous tumor model.
The enormous basic studies and clinical trials evaluated
the anti-tumor effect in cancer immunotherapy. However,
few anti-cancer therapies can completely eliminate the
tumor in subcutaneous tumor model. Many studies used
the agents which excessively stimulate host immune
response like GalCer or TLR agonists. These agents can
induce pro-inflammatory cytokines and IFNs in cancer
immunotherapy. Previous reports demonstrated that these
factors could induce IL-10, iNOS, and indoleamine 2,3
deoxgenase that have the immune suppressive effect [33,
34]. The induction of excessive host immune response
promotes the immune suppressive factors in host.
Therefore, the anti-tumor efficacy of monotherapy using

In the present study, we have shown the inhibition
of iNOS activity significantly enhanced the anti-tumor
effect of GalCer in lung metastatic tumor model and
primary subcutaneous tumor model. The administration
with GalCer enhanced the tumor antigen-specific response
and cytotoxic activity in the absence of iNOS expression.
Moreover, the increase of CD8+ cells and the decrease of
CD11b+/Ly6G+ cells within tumor might be involved in
the impairment of tumor growth.
GalCer enhances host immune system via NKT
cell activation. The activation of NKT cells induces
the amount of Th1 cytokines, including IFN-γ and Th2
cytokines. Many reports indicated that the increase of
Th1 cytokines production lead to the induction of antitumor immunity [18]. Therefore, the anti-tumor effect of
GalCer was recently evaluated in many animal and clinical
studies [19-21]. It is well-known that IFN-γ is a strong
inducer of iNOS. A recent report demonstrated that the
administration with GalCer also induces the expression of
iNOS and enhanced the NO production [22]. Indeed, the
injection of GalCer in tumor-bearing mice up-regulated
the mRNA expression of iNOS in the lung (Figure 1A).
In particular, iNOS expression in CD11b+ cells was
markedly increased after the administration with GalCer.
Monoctye/macrophage expresses CD11b molecules on
surface and induces iNOS by the stimulation of IFN-γ
[23]. In the present study, the iNOS expression in CD11b+
cells of BALF might be enhanced by IFN-γ from activated
NKT cells.
As shown in Figure 2, the inhibition of iNOS
activity by genetically modification or the administration
with L-NAME significantly enhanced the anti-tumor effect
of GalCer in lung metastatic tumor model. These results
indicated that the enhancement of anti-tumor response
by GalCer was not dependent on the type of cancer cell
line or mice. In subcutaneous tumor model, the antitumor effect of GalCer similarly increased in iNOSKO mice (Figure 5A). The frequency of CD8+ cells in
BALF of iNOS-KO mice was significantly increased by
the administration with GalCer compared to that of WT
mice (Figure 3A). In subcutaneous tumor model, CD8+
cells within tumor also increased in iNOS-KO mice after
GalCer injection (Figure 6A). It is well-known that CD8+
cells have cytotoxic activity against tumor cells and are
critical in cancer immunotherapy [24, 25]. The increase of
CD8+ cells within tumor might lead to the enhancement of
anti-tumor effect of GalCer in iNOS-KO mice. In general,
CD8+ T cells are involved in anti-tumor immunity via
the production of IFN-γ, FasL, and perforin [26, 27]. In
the present study, the treatment of GalCer in iNOS-KO
mice increased the expression of IFN-γ and FasL in the
lung (Figure4). These data supported that CD8+ T cells
within tumor of tumor-bearing iNOS-KO mice increased
after GalCer administration. The expression of CXCL9

immune stimulate agent might be reduced by the several
suppressive factors induced by these agents.
In conclusion, the present study showed that the
inhibition of iNOS significantly enhanced the anti-tumor
effect of GalCer in lung tumor model and subcutaneous
primary tumor model. The combination therapy of GalCer
and iNOS inhibitor might be a new strategy for cancer
immune therapy.

when the tumor cells were subcutaneously inoculated
into the flank. Tumor cells were implanted into the flank
of WT or iNOS-KO mice on day 0. After the tumors
became palpable ( > 5 mm in diameter), the mice were
intraperitoneally administered with GalCer (2 μg/mouse).
Tumor growth curves were generated using 6-9 mice per
group, and all results were derived by combining data
from 2 to 3 independent experiments. As previous study,
tumor size was calculated using the following formula:
(length × width × height)/2.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

ELISPOT assay

Mice

The ELISPOT assay was performed as described
previously [35]. Single-cell suspensions were prepared
from the draining lymph node (DLN) of subcutaneous
tumor-bearing mice treated with GalCer. A total of 2.0 ×
105 cells per well were stimulated for 14-16 h with 0, 0.1, or
1 μg/ml of ova SIINFEKL peptide in 96 well MultiScreen
filter plates (Millipore, Billerica, MA) previously coated
with monoclonal rat anti-IFN-γ antibody (Ab) (clone; R46A2) (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA). The plates were
washed and treated with biotinylated polyclonal goat antiIFN-γ Ab (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) followed by
streptavidin alkaline phosphatase. Staining was visualized
thorough the addition of a 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl
phosphatase solution (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) and
counted manually under 40× magnification. A single-blind
reviewer counted the number of cytokine-secreting cells,
and all data were generated by analyzing three separate
wells per sample.

Male C57BL/6J (H-2d) wild-type (WT) mice and
BALB/c mice (age, 8-10 weeks; weight; 25-30 g) were
obtained from Japan SLC Inc. (Shizuoka, Japan). iNOS
knockout (KO) mice with a C57BL/6J background were
obtained from Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME).
All procedures were conducted in accordance with the
National Institutes of Health Guide for the Care and Use
of Laboratory Animals, and with the guidelines for the
care and use of animals established by the Animal Care
and Use Committee of Gifu University.

Real-time reverse transcription-PCR
Total RNA was isolated from lung tissue, BALF
cells and tumor tissue, and transcribed into complementary
DNA (cDNA) using an RNeasy Mini Kit (QIAGEN,
Hilden, Germany) and a high capacity cDNA transcription
kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). The resulting
cDNA was used as a template for real-time RT-PCR
along with primer-probe sets for iNOS, CCL2, CXCL9,
FasL, IFN-γ, and 18S (TaqMan Gene Expression Assays;
Applied Biosystems) and TaqMan universal PCR master
mix (Applied Biosystems) according to the manufacturer’s
recommendations. 18S rRNA was used. Real-time RTPCR was carried out using a Light-Cycler 480 system
(Roche Diagnostic Systems, Basel, Switzerland). The
calculation of relative gene expression differences was
done by the comparative 2−∆∆CT method.

In vivo tumor studies
Mice were intravenously injected with B16 F10 cells
(3 × 105 in C57BL/6 mice), and CT26 carcinoma cells (2 ×
105 CT26 carcinoma cells in BALB/c mice), and GalCer
(2 μg/mouse) was administered into tumor-bearing mice 7
days after the inoculation of tumor cells. Seven days after
GalCer injection, mice were killed, and their lungs were
removed to count superficial metastatic nodules.
To establish the subcutaneous tumor model, mice
were challenged with EG7-OVA cells (1 × 106 cells in

CD8+ cells in DLN were isolated by magnetic
beads conjugated with an anti-CD8 antibody (Miltenyi
Biotec) as described in our previous report [36]. BALF
cells were sorted by CD11b+ status using magnetic
beads conjugated with an anti-CD11b antibody (Miltenyi
Biotec). The magnetically labeled cells were purified using
quadroMACS system (Miltenyi Biotec).

The cytolytic activity of EG7-specific lymphocytes
was assessed using a fluorescent-based dye, 5- (and 6-)
carboxyfluorescein diacetate succinimydyl ester (CFSE) as
described previously [25] . Target EG7 cells were labeled
with CFSE as follows: cells were suspended in PBS and
concentrated to 1 × 106/ml. For targets cells, 0.5 μl of
CFSE stock solution (5 mM) was added to 1 ml of cell
suspension and incubated for 4 min at room temperature.
For control targets cells, 0.5μl of diluted CFSE solution
(100 μM) was used for labeling. Labeled targets and
various numbers of effector cells were added to a final
volume of 200 μl in each well of the 96-well round-bottom
plates and incubated for 6 h at 37°C. After incubation,
sensitive target cells were mixed with control cells in
a tube with PBS containing 1% FCS and 0.1% sodium
azide. The mixed cells were washed once and suspended
in 4% paraformaldehyde-containing PBS and stored at 4°C
in the dark until cytometer acquisition. Acquisition was
performed using a FACSCantoII (BD Immunocytometry
Systems). All samples were assayed in duplicate and
the mean percentage of specific lysis was calculated as
follows: % specific lysis = [(number of sensitive target
cells in control sample − number of sensitive target cells
in test sample) / number of sensitive target cells in control
sample] × 100. The terms control sample and test sample
indicate target cells incubated without added effector
cells and target cells incubated with added effector cells,
respectively.
