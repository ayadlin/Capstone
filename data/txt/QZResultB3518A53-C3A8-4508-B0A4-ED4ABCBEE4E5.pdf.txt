ABSTRACT:
Activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID) was originally identified as an
inducer of somatic hypermutation (SHM) and class switch recombination (CSR) in
immunoglobulin genes. However, AID can also cause mutations in host genes and
contribute to cancer progression and drug resistance. In this study, molecular docking
showed the interaction of free 5-aza-CdR and Zebularine (Zeb) with AID. However,
only 5-aza-CdR-incorporated ssDNA bound to the active site of AID and inhibited AID
expression through proteasomal degradation. 5-aza-CdR demonstrated cytotoxicity
against AID-positive and -negative hematopoietic cancer cells. In contrast, Zeb
exhibited a cytotoxic effect only in AID-negative cells due to its inability to inhibit
AID expression. This differential effect might be due to the DNMT1 stabilization
induced by AID, thus restricting the ability of Zeb to deplete DNMT1 and induce tumor
suppressor genes (TSGs), such as p21, in AID-positive cells. Moreover, the in vivo
anticancer effect of 5-aza-CdR but not Zeb in AID-positive hematopoietic cancer cells
was demonstrated. The study not only displays the association of AID and DNMT1
and identifies a novel biological function of AID, but also provides novel information
regarding the use of DNMT inhibitors to treat AID-positive hematopoietic cancers.

INTRODUCTION

breaks in the c-myc gene, resulting in its translocation
to the Ig loci and uncontrolled expression of c-Myc in
Burkett’s lymphoma [4, 5].
AID also plays an essential role in the progression of
Philadelphia-positive (Ph+) leukemias, including chronic
myeloid leukemia (CML) and Ph+ acute lymphoblastic
leukemia (ALL) [6, 7]. The Ph chromosome originates
from a translocation between the c-abl on chromosome
9 and the bcr gene on chromosome 22, leading to a
BCR/ABL1 fusion protein. The forced expression of
the Abelson tyrosine kinase ABL1 can phosphorylate a
wide range of substrates that regulate cell proliferation,
differentiation, migration, survival, and DNA repair and
drive the pathogenesis of Ph+ leukemias [8]. Clinically,
CML follows a triphasic pattern of chronic, accelerated,

AID, encoded by the AICDA gene, belongs to the
apolipoprotein B-editing catalytic polypeptide (APOBEC)
family and was originally described as a B cell–specific
factor unique to activated germinal center B cells. During
CSR, AID is recruited to the switch region to deaminate
the nucleoside cytidine and convert it to uridine, causing
DNA point mutations and double strand breakage [1]. This
activity is essential for SHM and CSR, which generates
immunoglobulin diversity after V(D)J recombination [2].
In contrast to the favorable role of AID in the immune
system, AID can cause chromosomal translocations and/
or mutations in proto-oncogenes, thus promoting tumor
formation [3]. For example, AID induces double strand

and blast crisis. The majority of patients (85%) in the
chronic phase will progress to the accelerated phase
and blast crisis if untreated [9]. AID is expressed in a
subset of CML patients in lymphoid blast crisis, which
promotes the genetic instability of tumor suppressors
and DNA repair genes through point mutations and copy
number alterations. In addition, AID mutates BCR-ABL1,
providing a rationale for the rapid development of imatinib
resistance in blast crisis progression [6].
AID is also expressed in Ph+ ALL patients, who
show an increased mutation frequency of oncogenes
and TSGs, such as MYC, BCL6, and p16, which may
be relevant to the unfavorable prognosis in this subset
of ALL [7]. Bone marrow isolated from wild-type and
AID knockout mice were transduced with BCR-ABL1
to induce BCR-ABL1-driven ALL; then, ALL cells were
transplanted into the mice. The mice engrafted with
AID−/− ALL cells showed prolonged survival compared
with those transplanted with AID+/+ ALL cells. Molecular
analyses showed that AID−/− ALL cells had lower
frequencies of amplification, deletion and point mutation
in non-Ig genes, such as Pax5 and Rhoh, and failed to
repress TSGs including Rhon, p21 and Blnk. The results
indicate that AID may be an oncoprotein that accelerates
the evolution of ALL through aberrant hypermutation and
TSG downregulation [10]. A study has also shown that
AID can induce B-lymphoma/leukemia in a bone marrow
transplantation mouse model, and its activity to induce
CSR and SHM is essential for lymphomagenesis [11].
The cytidine ribose nucleoside analogue 5-azaCR (5-azacytidine) was initially identified as a potential
anticancer drug and was subsequently shown to be a
DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) inhibitor [12]. After
incorporation into DNA, 5-aza-CR is recognized by
DNMT1 to form stable covalent protein-DNA adducts.
DNMT1 are trapped and degraded, leading to rapid
protein diminish as early as 24 hours treatment [13, 14].
Eventually, DNA demethylation occurs, and then TSGs
are induced to inhibit cancer cell proliferation [15]. 5-aza2-deoxycytidine (5-aza-CdR), the deoxyribose analogue
of 5-aza-CR, was subsequently developed [16]. Cytidine
deaminase (CDA) is a key enzyme in the pyrimidine
salvage pathway, catalyzing the deamination of cytidine
and deoxycytidine into uridine and deoxyuridine. CDA
also deaminates cytidine analogues, including 5-azaCR and 5-aza-CdR, to reduce their stability [17, 18].
Another DNMT inhibitor, 1-(β-D-ribofuranosyl)-2(1H)pyrimidinone (zebularine; Zeb), is a cytidine analogue that
contains a 2-(1H)-pyrimidinone ring. Zeb was originally
synthesized as a CDA inhibitor [19]. Because both CDA
and AID can catalyze cytidine deamination, AID might
also be targeted by cytidine analogues.
In this study, molecular docking analysis showed
the interaction of both free 5-aza-CdR and free Zeb
with AID. However, only 5-aza-CdR-incorporated

www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

single-strand DNA (ssDNA) bound to the active site of
AID and inhibited AID expression through proteasomal
degradation. The cytotoxicity of 5-aza-CdR was observed
in both AID-positive and -negative hematopoietic cancer
cells. In contrast, Zeb cytotoxicity was only observed
in AID-negative cells due to its inability to inhibit AID
expression. This differential effect might be due to the
association and stabilization of DNMT1 by AID, thus
restricting the ability of Zeb to deplete DNMT1 and induce
TSGs, such as p21, in AID-positive cells. Moreover,
the anticancer effect of 5-aza-CdR but not Zeb on AIDpositive hematopoietic cancers was also demonstrated in
vivo. The study not only displays the association of AID
and DNMT1 and identifies a novel biological function of
AID, but also provides a novel role of a DNMT inhibitor
for treating AID-positive hematopoietic cancers.

RESULTS
Molecular docking of DNMT inhibitors to AID.
A previous study showed that the DNMT inhibitor
Zeb, a cytidine analogue, is a competitive inhibitor of
CDA due to its lack of a 4-amino group on the cytosine
(Fig. 1A) [20]. Because AID also catalyzes cytidine
deamination, we hypothesized that cytidine analogues,
such as 5-aza-CR, 5-aza-CdR, and Zeb, might inhibit AID.
Molecular modeling simulation was performed to test this
hypothesis. To our knowledge, the crystal structure of
AID has not yet been solved. Because the sequences of
AID and the APOBEC2 fragment shared 51.0% similarity
and 33% identity (suppl. Fig. S1A), the AID structure was
predicted based on the crystal structure of APOBEC2 [21]
(suppl. Fig. S1B). The proposed binding modes of 5-azaCR, 5-aza-CdR, and Zeb are illustrated in Figure 1B. Free
5-aza-CR, 5-aza-CdR, and Zeb bound to the active site
of AID and interacted with the zinc ion that is crucial for
the enzymatic reaction by the 2’,3’ hydroxyl group and
the 2’ carbonyl group (Fig. 1B and suppl. S1C). Based
on CDOCKER interaction energy, the binding capacity
of 5-aza-CR (-37.7) and 5-aza-CdR (-35.95) was higher
than that of Zeb (-27.312). These cytidine analogues
are incorporated into nucleic acids after entering the
cell membrane [13]. A previous study has shown that
AID targets the immunoglobulin H (IgH) switch region,
which contains 5’-AGCT-3’ repeats in its core [22].
Therefore, 5’-AGCT-3’ ssDNA, in which the cytidine
base was substituted by the respective azacytidine (5’-AGazaC-T-3’) or Zeb (5’-AG-ZebC-T-3’), was analyzed by
molecular docking. The 10 predicted binding modes are
illustrated in Figure 1C. Compared with 5’-AG-ZebC-T-3’
(Fig. 1C, right panel), 5’-AG-azaC-T-3’ was closer to the
catalytic site of AID, and both of them inserted into the

active site (Fig. 1C, left panel). The best insertion model
showed that the substituted 5-aza-cytosine inserted exactly
into the small active site (Fig. 1D), while the remainder of
the ssDNA interacted with the polar surface (as indicated
by the orange color) of AID (Fig. 1D, right panel). These
findings suggest that only azacytidine-incorporated ssDNA
could interact with AID.

AID expression (Fig. 2A, 2B and suppl. Fig. S2A).
However, AICDA mRNA was not significantly affected by
5-aza-CdR (Fig. 2C and 2D), indicating that 5-aza-CdR
might inhibit AID expression through post-transcriptional
regulation.
AID stability has been reported to be regulated
through the proteasome degradation pathway [23].
To investigate how 5-aza-CdR downregulates AID,
the cells were treated with 5-aza-CdR in the presence
of the proteasome inhibitor MG132. Restoration of
AID expression was observed (Fig. 3A, upper panel),
suggesting the involvement of proteasomal degradation in
this event. To further confirm this observation, AID protein
stability was examined in the presence of cycloheximide.
As shown in Figure 3A, lower panel, 5-aza-CdR reduced
AID protein stability, which was reversed by MG132.
Because proteasome degradation is usually triggered
by polyubiquitination [23], nuclear AID ubiquitination
was analyzed using an immunoprecipitation assay. The
smear blotting was more intense after co-treatment with
5-aza-CdR and MG132 (Fig. 3B, left panel), indicating
that 5-aza-CdR enhanced AID polyubiquitination. AID

5-aza-CdR but not Zeb destabilizes AID through
ubiquitin-proteasomal degradation.
Once incorporated into DNA, azacytidine traps
DNMT and triggers its degradation [14]. Because
azacytidine- but not Zeb-substituted ssDNA interacted
with AID (Fig. 1C), we proposed that 5-aza-CdR and
5-aza-CR would also trigger AID degradation. Therefore,
the inhibitory effect of DNMT inhibitors on AID
expression was examined in Burkitt’s lymphoma Raji and
Ph+ ALL SUP-B15 cells, which possess AID. 5-aza-CdR,
5-aza-CR, and Zeb all downregulated DNMT1 expression
[13]; however, only 5-aza-CdR and 5-aza-CR inhibited

degradation has been reported to occur in the nucleus
[23]; therefore, nuclear AID expression was examined.
AID was substantially downregulated in the nucleus
by 5-aza-CdR (Fig. 3B, right panel). To confirm this
finding, AID-negative CML K562 cells were transfected
with flag-AID through electroporation, and stable clones
were established. Nuclear flag-AID was downregulated
by 5-aza-CdR but not Zeb, although total flag-AID was
increased by 5-aza-CdR and Zeb (Fig. 3C, left panel).
Immunofluorescence (IFA) also indicated the degradation
of nuclear AID by 5-aza-CdR (Fig. 3C, right panel).
Because AID is normally restricted in cytoplasm to prevent
off-target deamination [24], a Crm1 inhibitor, leptomycin
B (LMB), which accumulates AID in the nucleus [25],
was further utilized to demonstrate the occurrence of this
event in the nucleus (Fig. 3D).

cell viability by Zeb was enhanced in AID-knockdown
Raji cells but attenuated in AID-overexpressing
K562 cells (suppl. Fig. S3, Fig. 4C and 4D), while the
inhibitory ability of 5-aza-CdR was not influenced by
AID expression (Fig. 4C). These results suggest that
5-aza-CdR targets both AID-positive and -negative cancer
cells due to its ability to deplete AID. To exclude the
possibility that AID-mediated genetic mutations alter Zeb
cytotoxicity, K562 cells were transiently transfected with
AID. Consistently, the cytotoxicity of Zeb was attenuated
by AID overexpression (Fig. 4D, right panel).

AID interferes with the effect of DNMT1 inhibitor
through stabilizing DNMT1
DNMT inhibitors induce growth arrest by
downregulating DNMT1 to promote the expression of
tumor suppressor genes [15]. Because AID expression
differentially influenced the cytotoxic effect of 5-azaCdR and Zeb, its role in DNMT1 inhibition was further
examined. Both 5-aza-CdR and Zeb depleted DNMT1 in
AID-deficient K562 cells, whereas the effect of Zeb was
apparently attenuated in AID-positive Raji cells (Fig. 5A,
left panel). Consistently, Zeb effectively downregulated
DNMT1 in AID-knockdown Raji cells but not in AIDoverexpressing K562 cells (Fig. 5 A, right panel and 5B,
left panel), indicating that the inhibitory effect of Zeb on
DNMT1 might be attenuated by endogenous AID levels
due to its inability to deplete AID. Similarly, the induction
of the tumor suppressor gene p21 by Zeb but not 5-azaCdR was diminished in AID-overexpressing K562 cells
(Fig. 5B, right panel).
A positive correlation between the protein but

The role of AID expression in the cytotoxicity of
DNMT inhibitors.
Because 5-aza-CdR but not Zeb was found to
induce AID degradation, the cytotoxicity of each agent
was examined in hematopoietic cells expressing different
AID levels. The cell viability of K562 (AID negative),
Raji (high AID) and SUP-B15 (low AID) cells was
assessed. Both 5-aza-CdR and Zeb inhibited the cell
viability of K562 cells, while Raji and SupB15 cells were
sensitive to 5-aza-CdR but resistant to Zeb (Fig. 4A and
4B). This differential effect indicated that AID might
play an interfering role in the anticancer effect of DNMT
inhibitors. To confirm this, the growth inhibitory effects
of 5-aza-CdR and Zeb were examined in AID-knockdown
Raji or AID-overexpressing K562 cells. The inhibition of

not mRNA expression levels of AID and DNMT1 was
observed in several stable clones of AID-knockdown Raji
cells and AID-overexpressing K562 cells (suppl. Fig.
S3A-S3C). AID overexpression also increased ectopic
DNMT1 expression, indicating the positive regulation
of these two enzymes at the protein level (suppl. Fig.
S3D). Furthermore, DNMT1 stability was decreased
in AID-knockdown Raji cells but increased in AIDoverexpressing K562 cells (Fig. 5C, left panel), and the
inhibition by Zeb was attenuated by AID overexpression
(Fig. 5C, right panel). These results indicate that AID
may stabilize DNMT1 to prevent its degradation by
DNMT inhibitors. Flag-AID ectopically expressed in
K562 cells and endogenous AID in Raji cells were coimmunoprecipitated with DNMT1 (Fig. 5D, upper pamel),
and the co-localization of AID and DNMT1 in Raji cells
was demonstrated (Fig. 5D, lower panel). These results
suggest that the association of AID and DNMT1 might
stabilize DNMT1. The silencing of AID by shAID caused
DNMT1 depletion and induction of TSGs, such as p21 and

Rassf1a (Fig. 5E).

5-aza-CdR inhibits cell growth in a mouse model.
Because AID accelerates CML progression by
causing imatinib resistance [6], the effect of DNMT
inhibitors on KCL22+AID cells was investigated.
Consistent with the results from K562 cells, Zeb- but
not 5-aza-CdR-induced cytotoxicity and DNMT1
downregulation were partially attenuated by AID
overexpression, and 5-aza-CdR also downregulated
nuclear AID levels (Fig. 6A and 6B). KCL22 cells
harboring AID fused to a luciferase reporter were intratibially injected into NOD/SCID mice to examine the
in vivo anticancer effect of 5-aza-CdR and Zeb. After
transplantation, the cells grew in the bone marrow and
spread throughout the body; However, KCL22+AID cells
displayed higher growth rate (83%) than KCL22 cells
(42%) (suppl. Fig. S4). The tumor-bearing mice were then
selected and treated with Zeb (500 mg/kg) or 5-aza-CdR

(0.5-5 mg/kg). Zeb inhibited the tumor growth of KCL22engrafted but not KCL22+AID-engrafted mice (suppl. Fig.
S5A and Fig. 6C, left panel). On the contrary, 5-aza-CdR
effectively inhibited tumor growth of both KCL22 and
KCL22+AID grafts (suppl. Fig. S5B and Fig. 6C, right
panel), and extended the mouse lifespan (Fig. 6D). These
data indicate that 5-aza-CdR but not Zeb could treat CMLLBC and AID-positive hematopoietic malignancies.

DISCUSSION
For the past decade, targeted therapy has developed
and become dominant for cancer treatment. Nevertheless,
cancers are still a cureless disease because of drug
resistance, which has never been resolved. Recently,
substantial evidences have indicated that AID not only
contributes to tumor formation and progression but also
causes drug resistance by mutating tumor suppressor
genes and oncoproteins [6, 10]. In addition, AID correlates
with poor prognosis [26, 27]. Therefore, AID might be a
potential target for preventing cancer progression and drug
resistance. In this study, we found that AID interacted with
and may stabilize DNMT1. This association interfered
with the ability of a DNMT inhibitor to deplete DNMT1
and induce p21. 5-aza-CdR inhibited nuclear AID
expression through ubiquitin-proteasome degradation, thus
exerting a cytotoxic effect in AID-positive hematopoietic
cancers. In contrast, Zeb effects were limited due to its
inability to inhibit AID expression.
Our data have indicated that AID might interact with
DNMT1 and stabilize its expression (Fig. 5 and suppl. Fig.
S3). However, how AID and DNMT1 interact with each
other is currently unclear. DNMT1 transfers methyl groups
into the CpG islands soon after replication to maintain
DNA methylation patterns in the newly synthesized
single strand. Direct binding of DNMT1 to proliferating
cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) in DNA replication sites has
been reported[28, 29]. We found the association of AID
with PCNA (suppl. Fig. S6). Therefore, PCNA might act
as a bridge for AID and DNMT1 interaction. In addition,
H3K9 trimethylation by G9a creates a binding platform
for HP1, which recruits DNMT1 and increases DNA
methylation [30]. It has been reported that AID forms a
complex with KRAB domain-associated protein 1 (KAP1)
and HP1 during CSR, leading to AID recruitment to switch
regions [31]. Therefore, HP1 might also act as a bridge or
scaffold for AID and DNMT1 interaction. It has been also
shown that post-translational modifications of DNMT1
modulate its stability. SET7/9, a histone methyltransferase,
mediates DNMT1 methylation at Lys142 and Lys1094 to
induce its proteasomal degradation [32, 33]. In contrast,
DNMT1 can be stabilized by Akt1 phosphorylation at
Ser143 which inhibits Lys142 methylation [33, 34]. PKA
phosphorylation of AID at Ser38 is crucial for its activity
in CSR [35]. Whether PKA phosphorylation of DNMT1
at Ser143 occurs through AID/DNMT1 complex remains

in CML cells increased cell survival in vitro and in vivo
(suppl. Fig. S4 and S7). Its effect on gene instability
could not fully explain this event. Our results showed that
silencing AID depleted DNMT1 with the concomitant
induction of hypermethylated TSGs, such as p21 and
Rassf1a, suggesting that differential gene expression in
AID+/+ and AID-/- cells may be attributed to DNMT1
levels in cells, in which the methylation status of tumor
suppressive genes was altered. In addition, most of B cell
lymphoma t(14;18) translocations occur in the CpG-rich
sites where both DNA methylation and AID are required
for creating the breakpoints for DNA recombination [36].
The positive association of AID and DNMT1 may be also
crucial for t(14;18) translocations.
AID expression is regulated at the transcriptional
and post-transcriptional levels [37]. Our results showed
that AID mRNA levels were not significantly affected
by 5-aza-CdR in hematopoietic cancers. Instead, 5-azaCdR reduced the protein stability of AID by promoting
its degradation in the nucleus, suggesting that 5-aza-CdR
downregulated AID expression at the post-transcriptional
level. Nuclear AID has been shown to be polyubiquitinated
and degraded by proteasomes through an unclear
mechanism [23]. 5-aza-CdR induces the degradation of
DNMT1 through APC/CCdh1-mediated polyubiquitination
[14]. Whether APC/CCdh1 E3 ligase is also involved in
the AID polyubiquitination and degradation induced by
5-aza-CdR requires investigation. Recently, the E3 ligase
RING finger protein 126 (RFN126) has been found for
the ubiquitination of AID [38]. Whether 5-aza-CdR
could upregulate RFN126 to degrade AID will also be

investigated. Alternatively, AID can undergo ubiquitinindependent protein degradation through the REGγ
proteasome pathway [39]. Although 5-aza-CdR-induced
polyubiquitination of AID has been demonstrated, an
ubiquitin-independent pathway cannot be excluded.
The structures and metabolisms of 5-azaCdR, 5-aza-CR and Zeb are different. 5-aza-CdR is
phosphorylated by deoxycytidine kinase and other kinases
into triphosphate, which can be incorporated into newly
synthesized DNA [40]. In contrast, 5-aza-CR and Zeb are
primarily phosphorylated by uridine-cytidine kinase and
other kinases into triphosphates, which are ultimately
incorporated into RNA [41]. However, the diphosphate
forms of 5-aza-CR and Zeb can also be reduced by
ribonucleoside reductase into deoxy-diphosphates, which
can be incorporated into DNA [42, 43]. Degradation
of DNMT1 by 5-aza-CdR and Zeb demonstrated their
incorporation into DNA [13, 44]. However, only 5-azaCdR could trigger AID degradation. Molecular docking
analyses showed that azacytidine but not Zeb-substituted
ssDNA could insert into the catalytic site of AID, which
might explain the differential effect of 5-aza-CdR and Zeb
on AID expression.
5-aza-CR and 5-aza-CdR have been used for the
treatment of MDS [45]. They have also been considered
powerful candidates for acute myeloid leukemia (AML),
CML and ALL [46]. Phase II studies have shown that low
doses of 5-aza-CdR exhibit clinical activity against CML,
including imatinib-resistant cases [47, 48] . Furthermore,
the combination of 5-aza-CdR and imatinib is well
tolerated and active for CML patients in the accelerated

Figure 7: A hypothetical model for the role of AID in the anticancer effect of DNMT inhibitors. (A) AID may co-localize
with DNMT1 on DNA and enhance its stability in B-lymphoid malignancies. 5-aza-CdR and Zeb incorporate into DNA. (B) 5-aza-CdR
targets the active site of AID and DNMT1 and then destabilizes AID and DNMT1 through the proteasome degradation pathway. Eventually,
DNA is demethylated, and TSGs are induced. (C) Because Zeb is unable to bind to the active site of AID, DNMT1 is stabilized and avoids
degradation by Zeb. Thus, the anticancer effect of Zeb is inhibited

or myeloid blastic phase [49]. 5-aza-CdR is currently in
a phase I clinical trial for refractory and relapsed ALL
(ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT00349596). Because
AID contributes to tumorigenesis, imatinib resistance,
clonal evolution, and immune evasion in various
hematopoietic malignancies [6, 10, 50], our results provide
a novel molecular basis for a new indication of 5-aza-CdR
in treating AID-positive hematopoietic cancers.
Taken together, we propose a model for our
hypothesis (Fig. 7). The incorporation of DNMT inhibitors
into DNA triggers DNMT1 degradation through the
proteasomal pathway, resulting in DNA demethylation,
TSG induction, and growth arrest. In AID-overexpressing
hematopoietic cancer cells, however, AID interacts with
and stabilizes DNMT1, which blocks the anticancer
effect of Zeb due to its inability to downregulate AID
and hinders DNMT1 degradation. In contrast, DNAincorporated 5-aza-CdR can trigger AID degradation
through an ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. Thus, 5-azaCdR can effectively degrade DNMT1 to exert its anticancer effect against both AID-positive and AID-negative
cells. Our results provide a novel role for the clinical
utility of 5-aza-CdR to treat AID-expressing cancers and
indicate the crucial concern for the selection of DNMT
inhibitors. AID downregulation by DNMT inhibitors, such
as 5-aza-CdR, may be beneficial for the treatment of AIDexpressing cancers.

5-aza-CdR (Biovision) and zebularine (Sigma Aldrich)
for in vitro experiments were prepared in DMSO at
appropriate doses. Zebularine (NSC 309132) for animal
studies was provided by the Drug Synthesis and Chemistry

Homology modeling
The sequence alignment between AID and
APOBEC-2 was performed with the ClustalW module
using the BLOSUM multiple alignment scoring matrix
in Discovery Studio 2.55. The sequence identity and
similarity between AID and APOBEC-2 were 31.8% and
51.0%, respectively. The homology model structure was
generated and optimized using MODELLER in Discovery
Studio 2.55. The APOBEC-2 structure was obtained from
the Protein Data Bank (PDB ID: 2NYT). The structure
with the lowest energy score was selected as the final
model.

Molecular docking
Docking simulations of single-stranded DNA were
performed using PLANTS 1.2 software. The structure
of single-stranded DNA (5’-A-T-azaC-G-3’) was built
with the “Build and Edit Nucleic Acid” tool in Discovery
Studio 2.55. The binding site was set as a sphere with a
40 Å radius centered from the zinc atom to ensure that
the entire protein structure was included. All parameters
were set to the default settings. Docking simulations of
the small molecules Zeb and 5-aza-CdR were performed
using the CDOCKER program in Discovery Studio 2.55
with the default parameters. Ligand structures were
constructed using the ChemDraw Ultra 12 program and
further processed using the Prepare Ligands protocol in
Discovery Studio 2.55 to convert to a 3D structure and
assign the ionization state. All parameters were set to the
default settings.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell culture and construction of stable clones
AID-overexpressing CML KCL22+AID cells
(received from Dr. Markus Müschen, University of
California San Francisco) and ALL SUP-B15 cells
(obtained from Dr. Hu, Med. Biotech, National Taiwan
University) were cultured in IMDM. The Burkett’s
lymphoma Raji cells (received from Dr. Doong,
Department of Microbiology, National Taiwan University)
and the CML K562 cells were maintained in RPMI 1640
medium. All media were supplemented with 10% fetal
bovine serum (Gibco), 1% L-glutamine (Gibco), and 1%
antibiotic:antimycotic solution (Gemini Bio Products),
and the cells were incubated at 37°C in a humidified
incubator containing 5% CO2. For the generation of stable
clones, the pLKO.1-shAID plasmid (purchased from the
National RNAiCore Facility, Academia Sinica, Taipei,
Taiwan) was transduced into Raji cells through lentivirus
infection, and Raji-shAID cells were selected using 100
ng/ml puromycin. The pCMV-3XFLAG-AID plasmid
(received from Dr. Riccardo Dalla-Favera, Department of
Microbiology, Columbia University) was transfected into
K562 cells through electroporation (Nero Transfection
System, Invitrogen), and K562AID cells were selected

Immunofluorescence (IFA) and immunoblotting
For IFA, the slides with cells were immersed in
2% paraformaldehyde for 20 min. After fixation, TBST
with 1% goat serum was used to block the slides. The
cells were first incubated with the primary antibody antiflag (Sigma Aldrich) or co-incubated with anti-AID (Cell
Signaling) and anti-DNMT1 at 4°C overnight; then, the
secondary antibodies Alexa (488)-labeled anti-mouse
and Alexa (647)-labeled anti-goat (Invitrogen) were
added and incubated at 25°C for 30 min. The signal was
observed using a confocal microscope (Leica SP5). For

immunoblotting, the cells were lysed in sample buffer (50
mM Tris, 1 mM EGTA, 50 mM NaF, 150 mM NaCl, 1
mM Na3VO4, 1 mM β-glycerophosphate, 8.5 mM sodium
pyrophosphate, and 0.5% Triton X-100). lysates were
resolved on a 7.5% or 13% sodium dodecyl sulfate–
polyacrylamide gel followed by electrotransference
to a nitrocellulose membrane (Hybon-C). Then, the
membranes were incubated in TBST containing 5% milk
for 1 hr. Ultimately, the membranes were incubated with
the following primary antibodies: anti-DNMT1, antiDNMT3a, anti-ubiquitin, anti-p21, anti-lamin A/C (all
from Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-actin (Millipore),
anti-tubulin (Sigma-Aldrich) or anti-AID (Cell Signaling).

Immunoprecipitation

Cell viability assay

Total cell lysates or nuclear extracts were diluted
to 1 μg/μl, and 200-500 μl lysate was incubated with 2-5
μl anti-AID (Cell Signaling) or anti-flag antibody (Sigma
Aldrich) overnight at 4°C. The mixtures containing the
lysates and antibody were added to 50% protein-A beads
at a 1:20 ratio (volume) for 1 hr at 4°C; then, the beads
were precipitated at 2000 rpm for 5 min. Then the beads
were washed with PBS three times to clear nonspecific
proteins. A total of 20 μl PBS and 4 μl 6X sample dye were
mixed with beads to prepare samples for immunoblotting.

Raji (5 x 104 cells/ml), K562 (2 x 104 cells/ml) and
SUP-B15 (5 x 105 cells/ml) were seeding in 12 well plate,
and then treated with DNMT inhibitors at indicated doses
for 96 hrs. Cells (100 μl) were transferred to 96 well and
10 μl alarma blue (Invitrogen) was added to each well.
After 2 hrs, cell viability was analyzed by detecting
fluorescence. The wavelength at 525-535 nm was used to
excite fluorescence. Reference wavelength 535-590 nm
was measured on a multiwell plate reader.

In vivo imaging system (IVIS)

Statistical analysis

KCL22+AID-luc cells (5x105) were intra-tibially
(i.t.) injected into NOD/SCID mice. After the xenograft,
the mice were imaged at different time points using
IVIS (Xenogen, Caliper). The successfully transplanted
mice were selected to examine the anticancer effect of
the DNMT inhibitors. The treatments were administered
weekly on 5 consecutive days as 300 μl i.p. injections
of PBS, 5-aza-CdR (0.5 mg/kg) or Zeb (500 mg/kg).
D-luciferin (Promega) dissolved in PBS was injected into
mice at a dose of 2.5 mg/mice, and the light emission was
measured 1 min later. For anesthesia, 2.5% isoflurane
was administered to the mice via a nose cone. All animal
procedures were performed under protocols approved by
the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the
College of Medicine, National Taiwan University.

Data were analyzed using Student’s t test. P values
< 0.05 were considered significant.
