The inadequate transport of drugs into the tumor tissue caused by its abnormal vasculature is a major obstacle to the treatment
of cancer. Anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) drugs can cause phenotypic alteration and maturation of the tumor’s
vasculature. However, whether this consistently improves delivery and subsequent response to therapy is still controversial. Clinical
results indicate that not all patients beneﬁt from antiangiogenic treatment, necessitating the development of criteria to predict the
effect of these agents in individual tumors. We demonstrate that, in anti-VEGF-refractory murine tumors, vascular changes after VEGF
ablation result in reduced delivery leading to therapeutic failure. In these tumors, the impaired response after anti-VEGF treatment
is directly linked to strong deposition of ﬁbrillar extracellular matrix (ECM) components and high expression of lysyl oxidases. The
resulting condensed, highly crosslinked ECM impeded drug permeation, protecting tumor cells from exposure to small-molecule drugs.
The reduced vascular density after anti-VEGF treatment further decreased delivery in these tumors, an effect not compensated by the
improved vessel quality. Pharmacological inhibition of lysyl oxidases improved drug delivery in various tumor models and reversed the
negative effect of VEGF ablation on drug delivery and therapeutic response in anti-VEGF-resistant tumors. In conclusion, the vascular
changes after anti-VEGF therapy can have a context-dependent negative impact on overall therapeutic efﬁcacy. A determining factor is
the tumor ECM, which strongly inﬂuences the effect of anti-VEGF therapy. Our results reveal the prospect to revert a possible negative
effect and to potentiate responsiveness to antiangiogenic therapy by concomitantly targeting ECM-modifying enzymes.

INTRODUCTION
Treating solid tumors is complicated by the inadequate
transport of systemically administered drugs into the tumor
tissue.1 A wide range of antitumor agents, both cytotoxic drugs
and newer targeted therapies, has been shown to accumulate
at much higher concentrations in non-target organs than in the
tumor.2–6 Furthermore, the distribution of drugs within the
tumor is heterogeneous, leaving many tumor cells protected
from therapeutically effective drug concentrations.7–11
The abnormal vasculature observed in many tumors has been
discussed as a major factor in reducing tumor drug delivery.12,13
Tumor blood vessels are often tortuous, leaky, strongly ramiﬁed,
poorly supported by pericytes and lack a hierarchical structure,
which causes an often insufﬁcient and uneven blood ﬂow.
This aberrant vessel phenotype results from an imbalanced,
strongly pro-angiogenic microenvironment. Agents that dampen
the angiogenic signaling, such as inhibitors of the vascular
endothelial growth factor (VEGF) pathway, improve blood vessel
functionality. In preclinical models, increased pericyte coverage,
reduced interstitial pressure and diminished vessel leakiness are
observed after antiangiogenic therapy.14–16 The improved vessel
quality should indeed increase drug delivery into the tumor, and
this 'vessel normalization' hypothesis may explain why
1

antiangiogenic drugs that show little efﬁcacy as monotherapy in
patients improve response to concomitant chemotherapy.17
However, antiangiogenic drugs were developed to inhibit the
formation of the tumor vasculature, and reduction in vessel
density is also a well-documented result of antiangiogenic
treatment.16,18,19 Reduced vessel density decreases transport into
the tumor and increased tumor hypoxia is commonly reported
after VEGF ablation.19 Few studies have carefully examined the
consequences of antiangiogenic therapy not on surrogate markers
but on tumor drug delivery, with the contrarian results that the
effects could be either positive or negative.20–25 It can be assumed
that whether the 'improved vessel quality' or the 'reduced vessel
density' effect predominates after antiangiogenic therapy may be
affected by many factors. Among those are: the dosage of the
antiangiogenic drug, the duration of the treatment, and characteristics of the particular tumor. However, to date, we still lack
stratifying criteria to predict how antiangiogenic therapy affects
drug delivery in individual tumors.
To be effective, an antineoplastic drug must not only be
transported into the tumor but it also has to reach the individual
tumor cell at a critical concentration. Although the effectiveness of
drug transport into the tissue is determined by vascular characteristics, transport within the tissue occurs by diffusion.

Vascular changes after anti-VEGF therapy

The rate of diffusion within the tissue depends on the characteristics
of the extracellular matrix (ECM). Tumors are often characterized
by increased deposition of ECM proteins. Intriguingly, the ECM
can compromise up to 60% of the tumor volume. Furthermore,
subsequent enzymatic modiﬁcation can turn the tumor ECM
more rigid. The negative impact of the dense and rigid tumor
ECM on the diffusion of macromolecular agents has been
established.26,27 Less is known on its effect on small-molecule
drugs. Although composition, quantity and modiﬁcation of the
ECM differs widely between different tumors, experimental data on
how this inﬂuences drug efﬁcacy and outcome of therapy
are limited. Moreover, the likely interconnection between vascular
parameters, which can be affected by antiangiogenic treatment,
and diffusion controlling ECM parameters has not been studied
in detail.
Here we describe a model of syngeneic, implantable ﬁbrosarcoma that is resistant to monoclonal antibody mG6-31-driven
VEGF-ablation therapy.28 Blockade of VEGF in this model reduces
microvessel density, increases tumor hypoxia and impairs drug
delivery leading to reduced responsiveness to the chemotherapeutic drugs. We demonstrate that these resistant tumors express high
levels of lysyl oxidases, resulting in a high degree of ECM
crosslinking and impeded drug permeation by increasing the ECMs'
barrier function. These results highlight a strong interconnection
between vascular and ECM parameters in their inﬂuence of drug
transport in tumors. We show for the ﬁrst time that inhibition of
lysyl oxidases substantially improves drug delivery and potentiates
the therapeutic response to drugs used to treat malignant diseases.

RESULTS
MT6 sarcomas are resistant to VEGF ablation
In contrast to the situation in patients, most murine tumors are
responsive to VEGF ablation and react with signiﬁcant growth
reduction. Only few examples for murine tumors that react poorly
to anti-VEGF therapy are known.29,30 Interpretation of results from
combination treatments in responsive models is difﬁcult as both
anti-VEGF and the chemotherapeutic are individually effective
in reducing tumor growth. Thus an increased effectiveness by
combining both is impossible to pinpoint to a speciﬁc mechanism.
Consequently, the effects of anti-VEGF therapy on drug delivery
and efﬁcacy have to be studied in models that are unresponsive to
VEGF-ablation monotherapy.
Murine ﬁbrosarcomas established by implanting MT6 cells into
C57Bl/6 J mice31 failed to respond to anti-VEGF treatment with
mG6-31—an antibody that binds both the human and the murine
form of VEGF-A.28 When given at 5 mg/kg body weight (BW) every
6 days, mG6-31 did not signiﬁcantly reduce tumor growth (Figures 1a
and b). An effective doubling of the dosage (7.5 mg/kg BW, q4d) did
not improve the outcome (Supplementary Figure S1). Although
tumor growth was not signiﬁcantly affected, mG6-31 treatment

strongly reduced microvessel density (Figure 1c), improved vessel
maturation (indicated by increased pericyte coverage, Figure 1d)
and increased staining for the hypoxia marker carbonic anhydrase
IX (CA IX; Figure 1e). Taken together, these results demonstrate
that the mG6-31 antibody is effective in the MT6 tumors at
causing the expected vascular changes, though the tumors fail to
react with a reduction in growth. This mimics the situation
observed in patients and makes the MT6 tumors one a rare good
model to follow the effect of anti-VEGF treatment on drug
delivery.
VEGF ablation impedes efﬁcacy of chemotherapy in MT6 tumors
Because growth of the MT6 sarcomas is not affected by mG6-31
treatment, it is a suitable model to study the effect of anti-VEGF
treatment on drug delivery and efﬁcacy. The different cancers of
mesenchymal origin, typically grouped together as sarcomas,
respond poorly to systemic treatment with chemotherapies
(reviewed in Constantinidou et al.32). Addition of VEGF ablation to
the chemotherapeutic regimen could potentially improve the
situation of sarcoma patients. We devised a combination treatment
of well-established MT6 tumors with mG6-31 and doxorubicin,
the most commonly used therapeutic in the management of
sarcomas.33 In contrast to the expectations, combination of mG6-31
(5 mg/kg BW, q6d) with doxorubicin (5 mg/kg BW, on days 3 and 5
of a 6-day cycle) was less effective in reducing tumor growth than
doxorubicin alone (Figures 2a and c). The same was observed for
liposomal doxorubicin (doxil, Figures 2b and c). Doxorubicin induces
DNA double-strand breaks and thereby p53-mediated apoptosis.34
Immunohistochemistry showed signiﬁcantly less staining for
p53 and the apoptosis marker cleaved caspase-3 (Supplementary
Figure S2) after combination treatment compared with tumors
treated with chemotherapy alone, indicating reduced cytotoxic
efﬁcacy following anti-VEGF therapy.
We next tested whether the reduced cytotoxic efﬁcacy is caused
by reduced drug delivery into the tumor after mG6-31 treatment.
MT6-tumor bearing mice were treated with mG6-31 and, 2 days
later, injected with chemotherapeutics or Hoechst 33342 (H33342)
for microscopic drug distribution studies. Fluorescent quantiﬁcation of tumor-extracted doxorubicin showed strongly reduced
deposition of the drug after mG6-31 treatment, whether it was
used as free base or as liposomal formulation (Figures 2d and e).
When the experiment was repeated on day 22 postimplantation
after two rounds of mG6-31, doxorubicin accumulation was still
signiﬁcantly lower in mG6-31-treated tumors than in controls,
indicating a persistent reduction in delivery (Figure 2e). Paclitaxel,
injected as 3H-labeled drug and quantiﬁed by β-scintillation,
also showed reduced accumulation in treated tumors (Figure 2f).
As in the previous experiments, tumor growth was not affected by
mG6-31 pretreatment, ruling out differences in drug accumulation
based on tumor size. H33342 distribution analysis revealed reduced
dye dispersal in tumors after mG6-31 treatment (Figures 2g and h).
Thus the vascular changes caused by VEGF ablation reduces the
total amount of drugs delivered to the tumors in the MT6 model,
thus protecting a substantial part of the tumors from the effect of
systemically applied cytotoxic agents. The reduced drug delivery
after VEGF ablation in combination with the refractoriness toward
anti-VEGF monotherapy reﬂects the situation seen in at least a
subset of patients21 and is a distinctive feature of the MT6 model.
To examine why drug delivery was reduced in the MT6 model,
we decided to compare it to a tumor model that responds to
VEGF sequestration with increased sensitivity to subsequent
chemotherapy. To use a model with characteristics strongly different
from the MT6 tumors, we decided on murine 4T1 mammary
carcinomas. Orthotopically implanted 4T1 tumors reacted to
mG6-31 treatment with reduced tumor growth and a combination
of mG6-31 and doxorubicin was more effective than either mG6-31
or the chemotherapeutic alone (Figures 3a and b). We tested

accumulation of doxorubicin and 3H-paclitaxel in treated 4T1
tumors 2 days after the ﬁrst dose of mG6-31 (day 14 after tumor
implantation, Figures 3c and d). Neither of the drugs was deposited
at higher concentrations after mG6-31 treatment in 4T1 tumors or
other organs. However, when whole tumor sections were assessed
for distribution of H33342, a larger proportion of the tumor stained
positive (Figure 3e). This indicates that vascular changes after
mG6-31 treatment caused a more uniform distribution of smallmolecule drugs, although the total amount of drug deposited per
tumor mass was not changed.
To further elucidate the reasons for the differential effect of
mG6-31 pretreatment in the two tumor models, we ﬁrst veriﬁed that
there were no intrinsic differences in sensitivity to the chemotherapeutic between 4T1 and MT6 tumor cells (Supplementary
Figure S3). The observed differential effect on drug delivery can
also be caused by differences in vascular density or vessel quality in
the tumor models. Thus mG6-31 treatment of 4T1 and MT6 tumors
was repeated in parallel, and the tumors were excised 4 days after a
single dose of mG6-31. Staining for the vessel marker CD31 revealed
more positive staining in MT6 tumors (Figures 3f and g). However,
microvessel density was not different (Figure 3h) as vessels were
larger in the MT6 tumors than in 4T1 tumors. A detailed 3D analysis
of perfused blood vessels stained with isolectin GS-IB4 showed that
blood vessels in MT6 tumors are larger, more tortuous and more
ramiﬁed (Figures 3j and k). Treatment with mG6-31 led in both
models to a pruned down, less chaotic vasculature. Perfused vessel
density was similarly decreased in both tumor models after VEGF
ablation (Supplementary Figure S4). Thus neither the vascular
parameters before treatment nor the changes affected on these
parameters by VEGF ablation indicated a cause for the differential
effect on drug delivery in the two tumor models. However, a striking
difference between 4T1 and MT6 tumors was the extent of H33342
penetration into the tumor parenchyma (Figures 3l and m). In
untreated 4T1 tumors, the dye penetrated much deeper from the
vessels into the surrounding tissue (21.30 ± 2.005 versus
8.914 ± 0.5670 μm in MT6). Treatment with mG6-31 improved dye
penetration in 4T1 tumors signiﬁcantly (35.20 ± 3.871 μm), whereas
the increase was minor in MT6 tumors (10.99 ± 0.7584 μm).
Consequently, the tumor volume that was supplied with H33342
in relationship to the vessel surface area was much higher in 4T1
tumors (Figure 3n). mG6-31 treatment improved this ratio in 4T1
tumors even further, while the changes in the MT6 tumors were
insigniﬁcant. In summary, mG6-31 strongly reduces the perfused
vessel density in MT6 sarcomas without signiﬁcantly improving drug
penetration into the tumor parenchyma. This results in less tumor
cells being reached and affected by the delivered cytotoxic drug,
reducing treatment efﬁcacy. In the 4T1 model, better tissue
penetrance is further enhanced after mG6-31 treatment, explaining
why after mG6-31 treatment a larger proportion of the tumor is
supplied with drugs despite reduced vessel density. These results
indicate that tissue permeability is one of the factors that determine
whether VEGF ablation improves delivery and response to
concomitantly applied drugs.
The ECM of non-responsive MT6 tumors is less permeable for
small-molecule drugs
Possible causes for the different tissue permeability are differences
in the ECM amount or its composition between MT6 and 4T1
tumors. Trichrome and picrosirius red staining of MT6 tumor
sections showed homogeneous deposition of collagenous matrix
forming a ﬁne interconnected network surrounding individual cells
(Figure 4a). Conversely, in 4T1 tumors collagen is often associated
with blood vessels, the network forming large irregular clusters of
cells. We next isolated ECM from both tumors. Cellular components
were removed by high salt extraction (Figure 4b) and the remaining
mainly insoluble material was re-suspended in buffer, yielding
a suspension of the complete, native ECM components (cECM).

Alternatively, we extracted the ECM precipitate with urea buffer,

(Figure 4d). cECM from MT6 tumors was signiﬁcantly less
permeable than cECM from 4T1 tumors (Figures 4e and f), while
the urea soluble fractions from both tumors did not differ in their
permeability (Figure 4g). Thus the ECM of MT6 sarcomas is indeed
less permeable and the components responsible for the low
permeability are difﬁcult to solubilize.
To start analyzing the difference between the ECM composition, mRNA expression analysis for a range of common protein
components of the tumor ECM and for proteins that modify and
stabilize the ECM in cultured MT6 and 4T1 cells was performed
(Figure 4h). The expression of most ECM proteins in MT6 and
4T1 cells differs substantially. However, most striking was the
signiﬁcantly higher expression of the lysyl oxidases LOX, LOXL1,
LOXL2 and LOXL4 in MT6 cells. The only family member that
shows slightly stronger expression in 4T1 cells was LOXL3. Lysyl
oxidases crosslink ECM proteins such as collagens and elastins
leading to increased tensile strength. We hypothesized that this
stiffening of the ECM impedes drug permeability and distribution. Together with the observed high content of ECM proteins
this could contribute to the negative effect of vessel depletion
by anti-VEGF therapy on drug delivery in the MT6 tumors.
Importantly, in contrast to ECM proteins, the ECM-modifying
enzymes of the lysyl oxidase family are directly pharmacologically targetable with small-molecule inhibitors. From the limited
amount of experimental data available, it seems that the
different LOX family members have an only moderately distinct
substrate pattern. Consequently, the overall oxidase activity
would be the determining factor controlling the permeability of
the ECM for small molecules. We measured lysyl oxidase activity
in the supernatants of MT6 and 4T1 cells using 2,5-diaminopentane,
a substrate recognized by all LOX-family members (Figure 4j).35–37
MT6 cells show a much stronger overall lysyl oxidase activity,
corroborating the mRNA expression results. Lysyl oxidases
are strongly expressed by ﬁbroblasts and actual lysyl oxidase
activity in tumors may be largely derived from ﬁbrosis and tumorassociated ﬁbroblasts. We therefore analyzed lysyl oxidase mRNA
expression in MT6 and 4T1 tumors (Figure 4k). Although differences
were smaller than in cell culture, MT6 tumors still expressed
signiﬁcantly higher LOX, LOXL1 and LOXL4 levels.
Lysyl oxidase-catalyzed crosslinking increases the barrier function
of the ECM
We next tried to clarify whether the high lysyl oxidase activity
in MT6 sarcomas can also be observed in other cancers, rendering
LOX inhibition a promising option to improve drug delivery in
a broad range of tumors. We ﬁrst quantiﬁed mRNA levels of the
different lysyl oxidases in different murine breast carcinomas and
sarcoma cells (Supplementary Figure S4). MT6 cells did not display
exceptional overall expression levels. As the overall lysyl oxidase
activity is most likely determining the degree of ECM crosslinking
and drug retention, we measured activity in the supernatant
of the different cell lines. Again activity secreted by MT6 cells into
the medium was not signiﬁcantly higher than with other lines of
murine or human origin (Supplementary Figure S4B). Patient samples
of ﬁbrosarcomas and breast carcinomas conﬁrmed that mRNA
expression levels of the lysyl oxidases vary widely between different
tumors (Supplementary Figure S5). Although ﬁbrosarcomas
expressed higher average levels of LOX and LOXL1–LOXL2, in several
of the carcinomas mRNA levels were comparable to the strongest
expressing sarcomas. LOXL4 showed higher expression in breast
carcinomas, whereas LOXL3 was not detectable in most tumors (data
not shown). Also, the expression levels of the individual lysyl oxidases
were not strictly correlated. Thus high expression of one family
member might compensate for the relative absence of another one.
To further substantiate the ability of lysyl oxidases to increase
drug retention of the ECM, we constructed vectors for recombinant
expression of human lysyl oxidases. Both mature human LOX
Oncogene (2017) 1 – 12

(rhmLOX) and human LOXL2 (rhLOXL2) were successfully expressed
and puriﬁed in an active form via immobilized metal-ion afﬁnity
chromatography (Supplementary Figure S6). Diluted matrigel was
combined with either rhmLOX or rhLOXL2 and used for coating of
transwell membranes (Figure 4l). Treatment with rhmLOX reduced
doxorubicin penetration through the matrigel layer signiﬁcantly to
69.5 ± 1.5%. The effect was not detectable after treatment with
3-aminopropionitrile fumarate (βAPN), an inhibitor of all ﬁve lysyl
oxidases. The same was observed using rhLOXL2 to catalyze
crosslinking (71.1 ± 3.9%) and by substituting collagen I for matrigel.
Chemical protein crosslinking also reduced permeability through
coated membranes (Supplementary Figure S7).
Lysyl oxidase inhibition improves drug delivery into tumors
The reported redundancy of the lysyl oxidase family members in their
biological function and substrate spectra, as well as our results that
expression of individual family members are highly diversely
expressed in tumors, suggested that a successful treatment strategy
by reducing ECM crosslinking should be based on an inhibitor that is
effective against all ﬁve lysyl oxidases. Thus, to test whether inhibition
of lysyl oxidase activity could improve drug delivery in vivo, we
treated established tumors with the pan-lysyl oxidase inhibitor βAPN.
The treatment was performed by intraperitoneal (i.p.) injections with
100 mg/kg BW βAPN in saline38 and did not affect the growth of MT6
tumors, whereas the growth of 4T1 tumors was reduced (Figure 5a).
However, doxorubicin concentrations after a single bolus injection
were found to be signiﬁcantly improved in both tumor models after
treatment, having nearly doubled in the treated MT6 tumors
(1.596 ± 0.3361 versus 0.8257 ± 0.1391%ID/g in control animals,
Figure 5b). In other organs, doxorubicin accumulation was not
signiﬁcantly changed after βAPN treatment. Injected Hoechst 33342
was more evenly distributed throughout the tumor after βAPN
treatment (Figures 5c and d). Improved oxygenation resulted in
reduced expression of the hypoxia-inducible factor 1α-regulated
genes CA IX and VEGF-A (Figure 5e). Recently, it was reported that
LOX positively regulates VEGF-A expression and thereby stimulates
angiogenesis.39 However, in contrast to this reported direct effect of
LOX activity on VEGFA expression, in vitro neither 4T1 nor MT6
cells reacted to βAPN with changed VEGF-A mRNA expression
levels (Supplementary Figure S8). These results demonstrated
that the reduced levels VEGF-A in the treated tumors are indeed
an effect of improved oxygenation. Finally, improved supply of
the tumors was indicated by a markedly reduction in central
necrosis after βAPN treatment (Figures 5f and g). To examine
whether the improvement in drug and oxygen supply to the
tumors was indeed caused by a better permeability of the ECM
after LOX(L) inhibition, we isolated cECM from both tumors after
treatment. Total interference reﬂection microscopy40 demonstrated the expected strong reduction of crosslinked collagen
ﬁbrils in the cECM of treated tumors (Supplementary Figure S7).
In transwell-coating experiments, cECM preparations showed
signiﬁcantly better permeability for doxorubicin after βAPN
treatment, indicating that lysyl oxidases have a critical role in
forming a chemo-protective barrier (Figure 5h).
Lysyl oxidase inhibition reverts the negative impact of VEGF
ablation on drug delivery in MT6 sarcomas
After having established that inhibition of lysyl oxidases
improved drug delivery and distribution, we tested whether
this affects therapeutic success in a combination therapy setup

we veriﬁed that combination of mG6-31 and βAPN did not affect
tumor growth (Supplementary Figure S7). In addition to excluding a
simple additive effect in the triple treatment group, the results of
the study also demonstrated that the refractoriness of the MT6
tumors towards VEGF ablation is not caused by their dense, highly
crosslinked ECM.

To test whether the improved response to chemotherapy
after combining lysyl oxidase inhibition with antiangiogenic therapy is caused by improved drug delivery, we treated
established MT6 sarcomas for the short period of 4 days
with βAPN in combination with a single dose of mG6-31
(Figure 6b) and examined distribution of Hoechst 33342 within
the tumor. In tumors treated with the combination of βAPN

DISCUSSION
Combining drugs that inhibit the VEGF pathway, such as Avastin,
with chemotherapeutic treatment regimens is meanwhile an
integral part in the management of various malignant diseases.

Nevertheless, the therapeutic beneﬁt of adding anti-VEGF agents
observed in large patient cohorts is only moderate, indicating that
not all patients beneﬁt equally from these agents. We need a
better understanding of how these agents inﬂuence transport and

efﬁcacy of cytotoxic drugs and in which context they are most
effective. This will enable us to predict which patients will beneﬁt
from adding vascular-targeted therapies to their treatment and in
which patients antiangiogenic therapy might be detrimental.
The refractoriness of MT6 tumors to anti-VEGF therapy does not
only reﬂect the situation in patients but also permits unperturbed
observation of secondary effects, such as drug transport and
effectiveness. Recently, Van der Veldt et al.21 have demonstrated
that bevacizumab (Avastin) leads to decreased perfusion and
delivery of docetaxel in non-small-cell lung cancer patients.
However, the experimental setup in this study did not allow
for assessment of whether therapeutic efﬁcacy was also reduced
or whether non-small-cell lung cancer patients would still beneﬁt
from the combination by a possible additive effect. The MT6
model displays the same response to anti-VEGF that is observed
in these patients, and our results indicate for the ﬁrst time that
such a reduction in drug delivery after anti-VEGF therapy might
indeed compromise therapeutic activity. If VEGF ablation leads to
impaired delivery and distribution of cytotoxic drugs but has
no measurable antitumor effect by itself, combination of both
might indeed be less effective than the cytotoxic drug alone.
However, if the antiangiogenic drug itself inhibits tumor growth,
a combination with a cytotoxic drug may still prove beneﬁcial, as
Cesca et al.23 reported for vandatenib that also reduced paclitaxel
transport into xenografts, but a combination of both was still
better than each therapeutic alone.
In our experiments, the vascular changes after VEGF ablation
improved response to chemotherapy in 4T1 breast carcinomas. The
varying results using anti-VEGF/cytotoxic combination therapy
indicate that the effect of antiangiogenic therapy is indeed strongly
context dependent.
Our results experimentally underline the inter-relationship
between vessel characteristics that control tumor perfusion and
matrix properties that regulate drug diffusion within the tissue.
In the MT6 model, the key factor leading to reduced accumulation
and effectiveness of cytotoxic drugs after mG6-31 treatment was
clearly the dense, highly crosslinked ECM. The MT6 matrix
was altered nearly impermeable to small-molecule drugs by high
lysyl oxidase levels, an effect further corroborated in several
in vitro experiments. Consequently, only in combination with
lysyl oxidases inhibition, VEGF ablation was able to improve drug
delivery into MT6 tumors. In addition to lysyl oxidases, it is likely
that also other ECM-modifying enzymes and the composition and
quantity of ECM components themselves have a strong impact on
drug permeability and thereby on the effect of antiangiogenic
therapeutics. Besides the drastically different lysyl oxidase levels, the
differences in ECM content and composition probably contributed
to the differential drug permeability observed in 4T1 and MT6
tumors. Hyaluronic acid has been shown to impede drug diffusion
by a very different mechanism: as it binds large amounts of water,
a high hyaluronic acid content results in high interstitial pressure
and collapsed blood vessels. Enzymatic removal using exogenous
hyaluronidase can reduce the tumor’s interstitial pressure,
subsequently improving vessel perfusion and drug efﬁcacy.41,42 As
an intuitive next step to improve drug delivery, the concept of
combining matrix modiﬁcation with antiangiogenic therapy has also
been put forward.43,44
The enzymatically active lysyl oxidases are linked to more invasive
and metastatic behavior: in several preclinical models, inhibition of
lysyl oxidase with βAPN or antibodies resulted in a therapeutic
effect, most markedly suppression of metastasis.38,45–48 Our results
demonstrate that, beside this effect on tumor cell behavior, lysyl
oxidase inhibitors might have beneﬁts as auxiliary drugs with the
potency to increase the efﬁcacy of systemic treatment. In addition
to improving drug distribution, treatment with βAPN also improved
tumor oxygenation. This is in accordance with previous reports that
apparent diffusion constant and pO2 in tumors is correlated.11,49
Improved oxygenation by itself reduces aggressiveness of treated
Oncogene (2017) 1 – 12

tumors.50,51 Recently, it has been shown that reduced hypoxia result
in even further ECM changes by decreased PLOD2 expression,
which subsequently reduces metastasis.52
It is important to note that uptake of chemotherapeutics in
other organs was not signiﬁcantly altered by prolonged βAPN
treatment, although some of these organs (for example, heart,
muscle) express high levels of lysyl oxidases. In the fast growing
murine tumors, the ECM is continuously newly formed and
remodeled. When lysyl oxidases are inhibited and cannot crosslink
the freshly formed ECM, it will alter its characteristics, including its
drug-retention abilities. In the resting, normal tissue, this aspect of
lysyl oxidase activity might have a lesser role and might inﬂuence
the ECM's quality only after more chronic inhibition. It is known
that lysyl oxidase activity is necessary to maintain functional and
mature connective tissue. Its inhibition by substances such as
βAPN can cause diseases, such as lathyrism.53 Targeting tumorspeciﬁc upstream regulators of lysyl oxidase expression might be
an alternative way to improve ECM characteristics. Recently, Liu
et al.8 reported that inhibition of transforming growth factor-β in
experimental mammary carcinomas improved delivery of doxorubicin and doxil. Transforming growth factor-β is a known positive
regulator of all lysyl oxidase family members.54,55
Similar to the defective vasculature, the dense tumor ECM
impairs transport and distribution. Both characteristics thereby
simultaneously protect the tumor from treatment and contribute
to a more malignant phenotype. Auxiliary drugs that change
these characteristics could improve efﬁcacy of the whole array of
antitumor drugs currently at our disposal. Moreover, a better
understanding of the intricate mechanisms that protect the tumor
from the negative impact of our treatment efforts could lead to
a strategic approach toward cancer therapy that aims at defusing
those protective traits and making tumors more vulnerable.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
If not otherwise indicated, chemicals were purchased from Sigma Aldrich
(Munich, Germany) or Carl Roth (Karlsruhe, Germany). βAPN was purchased
from Sigma Aldrich. Protein concentrations were determined with the
Pierce BCA Kit (Thermo Fisher, Rockford, IL, USA) using a 30-min incubation time at 60 °C. The anti-VEGF antibody mG6-31 and a control IgG
(anti-Ragweed) were provided by Genentech (San Francisco, CA, USA).

Cell culture
MT6 (CRL-2805), 4T1 (CRL-2539), MDA-MB-231 (HTB-26), MDA-MB-435S
(HTB-129), MCF7 (HTB-22), ZR-75-1 (CRL-1500) and LLC (CRL-1642) cells were
obtained from ATCC (Manassas, VA, USA). AC755, EMT6 and 38290 TTT cells
have been purchased from NCI Tumor Repository (http://ncifrederick.cancer.
gov/Services/NcifRepositories.aspx). E0771 cells have been purchased from
Tebu-Bio (Offenbach, Germany). All tumor cells were maintained in
Dulbecco’s modiﬁed Eagle’s medium (Gibco/Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc,
Waltham, MA, USA) with 10% fetal bovine serum and Penicillin/Streptomycin
at 37 °C, 5% CO2. Cell lines were tested for mycoplasma contamination.

Tumor models and treatment
All experiments involving animals were reviewed and approved by the
institutional animal care and use committee at MSKCC or by the Regional
Administration of Unterfranken, Würzburg, Germany. All animal experiments were performed according to ethical standards and guidelines.
Tumor engraftment. MT6 (106 cells in phosphate-buffered saline) ﬁbrosarcomas were generated by subcutaneous injection in the dorsal region of
female C57Bl/6 J mice. 4T1 (105 cells in phosphate-buffered saline) breast
adenocarcinomas were generated by injection of cells into the inguinal
mammary fat pad of female Balb/c mice. Balb/c mice were purchased from
Charles River (Sulzfeld, Germany) and C57Bl/6J from Jackson Laboratories
(Bar Harbor, ME, USA).
All animals in the individual experiments were of the same age and sex.
For each experiment, tumor-bearing mice were randomly assigned to the
different treatment groups just prior to the start of treatment. In treatment

studies where tumor growth was a critical outcome, assessment of tumor
size was performed blinded by a second researcher.
Exclusion of data. Animals that never developed tumors owing to take rate
o100% were excluded from the studies. All data from animals that died or
had to be killed prior to the scheduled termination of the experiment were
excluded.
Tumor treatment. Treatment of fully established tumors started on day 12
after implantation. mG6-31 or an anti-Ragweed control antibody were
given at 5 mg/kg every 6 days on days 12, 18 and 24 by i.p. injection.
Doxorubicin/doxil (both at 5 mg/kg BW free doxorubicin) was administered by i.p. injection on days 14, 16, 20, 22, 26, 28, 32 and 34. Control
substance for doxorubicin was 0.9% NaCl.
3-APN was administered at 100 mg/kg or 30 mg/kg BW in 0.9% NaCl by
daily i.p. injection. Control substance was 0.9% NaCl.
Tumor growth was followed by measuring perpendicular diameters of the
tumors with a vernier calliper. Tumor volume was calculated using the
equation V = π/6 × l × w2. In addition, tumors were excised postmortem and
weighted. Only tumors that could be excised completely without additional
invaded tissue were used for weight measurements.
