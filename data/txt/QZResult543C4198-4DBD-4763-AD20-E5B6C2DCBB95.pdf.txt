ABSTRACT
The activated JAK2-STAT3 signaling pathway is a high risk factor for multiple
myeloma (MM), a fatal malignancy of plasma cells. In the present study, SC09, a
potential inhibitor of cholesterol absorption, was identified in a STAT3-targeted drug
screen. SC09 suppressed the activation of STAT3 in a time-course and concentrationdependent manner but did not affect its family members STAT1 and STAT5. SC09
inhibited STAT3 transcriptional activity and downregulated the expression of STAT3regulated genes. Further studies showed that SC09 selectively inhibited JAK2
activation but not other kinases including c-Src, ERK, p38 and mTOR that are all
associated with STAT3 activation. Moreover, SC09 obviously induced MM cell death
in vitro and delayed MM tumor growth in vivo. SC09-induced MM cell death was
dependent on the endogenous STAT3 status, and this effect could be attenuated by
enforced expression of STAT3. All the results collectively indicated that SC09 blocks
the JAK2-STAT3 signaling thus displaying anti-MM activity. Given its well tolerance
and anti-MM potency, SC09 is credited for further investigation as a promising drug
for MM treatment.

that MM is a genetic disease featured with dysregulation
of some molecular events, of which the transcription
factor STAT3 is of interest and plays a prominent role in
myelomagenesis [3, 4]. STAT3 is highly expressed in more
than 63% of CD138+ bone marrow cells of MM patients
[5]. By modulating important pro-survival genes, STAT3
promotes MM cell proliferation, survival and adhesion,
and protects cells from drug-induced cell apoptosis [6].
STAT3 also contributes to drug resistance. A recent study
found that suppression of the STAT3 signaling pathway by
the tight junction protein 1 increases proteasome inhibitor
sensitivity in MM cells [4]. In addition to drug sensitivity
and resistance, STAT3 also predicts poor prognosis of
MM patients. A sequencing screen over 142 untreated
MM patients revealed that STAT3-mutation contributes a
statistically significantly shortened progression-free survival
and overall survival in these patients [7]. All the above

INTRODUCTION
Multiple myeloma (MM) is a class of fatal and
progressive hematological malignancy derived from
plasma cells, the cells that produce antibodies. MM is
the second most blood cancers and accounts for 2% of all
cancer-associated death worldwide [1]. Last decades have
witnessed the progress in MM pathophysiology and in the
development of drug discovery, however, there is no cure
for this specific disease [2]. Development of novel drugs
is urgent.
Molecularly targeted drug discovery is a promising
strategy for the precision treatment of various cancers.
During the last decade, a panel of molecularly targeted
anti-cancer drugs have been marketed and have been
demonstrated to be effective in both complete remission
and progression-free survival. It has been demonstrated

findings provide a solid rationale for MM treatment by
targeting the STAT3 signaling. Indeed, inhibition of STAT3
activity by small molecule compounds leads to MM cell
apoptosis [8]. In the present study, we found the inhibitor of
cholesterol absorption SC09 displays anti-MM activity by
suppressing the JAK2-STAT3 signaling pathway.

by the high throughput screen, which suggested that SC09
was probably an inhibitor of the STAT3 signaling pathway.
To verify this hypothesis, a panel of MM cell lines were
treated with SC09 overnight, followed by immunoblotting
assay. As shown in Figure 1B, SC09 decreased STAT3
phosphorylation at Tyr705, an activated form of STAT3, in
all cell lines examined. And this effect was concentrationdependent (Figure 1C). To find out whether SC09 could
inhibit STAT3 activation in a short-time period, RPMI8226 cells were incubated with SC09 from 15 to 180
min, followed by evaluation of STAT3 phosphorylation at
Tyr705. As shown in Figure 1D, SC09 suppressed STAT3
activation as early as in 15 min, and more than 80% was
suppressed within 60 min, which thus suggested that SC09
rapidly inhibited STAT3 activation. Next, OCI-My5 cells
were starved overnight followed by SC09 treatment and
IL-6 stimulation. The results showed that IL-6, a key
trigger of STAT3 signaling, markedly activated STAT3, but
it was suppressed by SC09 in a time-dependent manner
(Figure 1E). And this effect was found in RPMI-8226 and
NCI-H929 cells in a concentration-dependent manner

RESULTS
SC09 inhibits STAT3 activation in MM cells
To find out novel inhibitors that disrupt the STAT3
signaling for MM treatment, we designed a STAT3luciferase-based high throughput screen. Using this
screening system, several candidates of STAT3 inhibitors
were identified [8]. In the present study, we focused on the
small molecule compound SC09 (Figure 1A), a reported
inhibitor of cholesterol absorption (International Patent
Publication Number: WO2007/008529A2). In this study,
SC09 was preliminarily found to reduce the expression of
luciferase under control of STAT3-recognition elements

(Figure 1F). Because STAT3 is one of the 6 members in
the STAT superfamily, of which STAT1 and STAT5 are
also involved in cell proliferation. Therefore, we further
evaluated the STAT1 and STAT5 activation levels after
SC09 treatment. As shown in Figure 1F, SC09 markedly
suppressed the activation of STAT3, but it did not show any
effects on STAT1 or STAT5. These findings collectively
suggested that SC09 selectively inhibits STAT3 activation.

Figures 3B–D, SC09 was well docked into the active
pocket of JAK2 in which SC09 formed extensive van
der Waals interactions with the hydrophobic residues of
JAK2 (Figure 3C) and formed strong and stable hydrogen
bond (red line in Figure 3D) with Leu855 of JAK2. These
results indicated that SC09 strongly interacted with JAK2
and led to the inhibition of JAK2 activity.
We next measured the JAK2 activation level in
MM cells. In both NCI-H929 and RPMI-8226 cells,
SC09 inhibited JAK2 phosphorylation in a concentrationdependent manner in the presence of IL-6, the major
stimulator of JAK2-STAT3 signaling pathway (Figure
3E). More importantly, SC09 also suppressed endogenous
JAK2 activation at a level similar to the inhibition of
STAT3 (Figure 3F, Figure 1D). We also measured the
inhibitory efficacy of SC09 on the activity of JAK2 and
its family members. JAK2 is a non-receptor kinase of
the Janus kinase family including JAK1, JAK2, JAK3
and TYK2 [11]. In the cell-free enzymatic assay, SC09
was found to prefer to inhibit JAK2 activity. Of these 4
enzymes, the IC50 of SC09 on JAK2 was 8.88 μM, more
than 10 times lower than those to other kinases (IC50s to
JAK1, JAK3 and TYK2 were 152.7, 138.9 and 111.5 μM,
respectively). We also measured the inhibition of SC09
on c-Src and the IC50 was 276.2 μM. Notably, this result
to c-Src was consistent to the immunoblotting assay as
shown in Figure 3A and SC09 had no effects on c-Src
activation. Therefore, we could conclude that SC09
preferred to inhibit JAK2 activity and presented itself as
an inhibitor of the JAK2-STAT3 signaling pathway.

SC09 inhibits the transcriptional activity of
STAT3 in MM cells
Because STAT3 is a transcription factor and the above
studies demonstrated that SC09 is a STAT3 inhibitor, we
wondered whether SC09 suppressed the transcriptional
activity of STAT3. To this end, we made a construct of
STAT3 recognition element (SRE)-driving firefly luciferase
as the reporter and transfected HeLa cells, followed by SC09
treatment. As shown in Figure 2A, SC09 inhibited luciferase
activity driven by SRE. When cells were stimulated with
IL-6, SC09 remained this inhibitory activity (Figure 2A).
In contrast, SC09 failed to inhibit luciferase activity driven
by the recognition element of NF-κB, another important
transcription factor (Figure 2B). To confirm this effect,
a luciferase construct driven by the cyclin D2 promoter
containing or lacking a STAT3 recognition element was
applied for the study. SC09 suppressed the luciferase
activity driven by the CCND2 promoter containing a STAT3
recognition element (Figure 2C) but not by the promoter
lacking a STAT3 recognition element (Figure 2D). These
findings thus demonstrated that SC09 suppressed STAT3
transcriptional activity. It is well known that STAT3
modulates the expression of a broad spectrum of genes,
including XIAP and MCL1 [9]. Therefore, we next
measured the expression of these two genes. As shown in
Figure 2E, SC09 downregulated the expression of these
genes at both the protein and mRNA levels. Therefore,
SC09 inhibits STAT3 transcriptional activity.

SC09 induces MM cell apoptosis in association
with STAT3 activation
SC09 had been demonstrated to be a potent
JAK2-STAT3 inhibitor, we therefore wondered whether
SC09 induced MM cell apoptosis. We firstly evaluated
whether MM cell sensitivity to SC09 was associated
with endogenous expression level of activated STAT3.
As shown Figure 4A, all MM cells harbored aberrantly
active STAT3 (p-STAT3), while NIH-3T3 cells did not
express active STAT3 (p-STAT3), which was consistent
with previous findings [12]. In the subsequent analysis on
cell proliferation, the results showed that the endogenous
STAT3 activation determined cell sensitivity to SC09. As
shown in Figure 4B, cells such as NCI-H929 and RPMI8226 expressing a high level of p-STAT3 were sensitive,
but NIH-3T3 cells lacking p-STAT3 were resistant to
SC09. OCI-My5 with less activated STAT3 was less
sensitive to SC09 than H929 and RPMI-8226 (Figure
4B). These results were confirmed in the cell apoptosis as
evidenced with the cleavage levels of PARP (Figure 4C).
All these findings pointed to that SC09 sensitivity was
dependent on the STAT3 activation level. To verify this
hypothesis, RPMI-8226 cells were treated with SC09 in the
presence or absence of IL-6, followed by immunoblotting

SC09 inhibits the JAK2-STAT3 signaling
pathway in MM cells
The above studies concluded that SC09 inhibits
STAT3 activation and transcriptional activity. However,
as a transcription factor, STAT3 is regulated by several
other factors, typically including a panel of kinases,
such as JAK2, c-Src, mTOR, and mitogen-activated
protein kinases (p38 and ERK) [10]. To understand the
inhibitory mechanism of SC09 on STAT3 activation, we
evaluated the activation of these kinases in the presence
of SC09 in MM cell lines RPMI-8226 and NCI-H929.
As shown in Figure 3A, SC09 selectively inhibited JAK2
phosphorylation but had no effects on other kinases tested
in the assay. Therefore, we wondered whether JAK2 was
the acting target of SC09. To verify this hypothesis, we
performed a computer docking analysis. As shown in

assay to evaluate cell apoptosis. As shown in Figure 4D,
when STAT3 was over-activated by IL-6, SC09-induced
PARP cleavage was partly abolished. To confirm this
finding, RPMI-8226 cells with enforced expression of
STAT3 were applied for SC09 sensitivity assay. As shown
in Figure 4E, STAT3 phosphorylation was increased upon
the transfection, along with decreased PARP cleavage. All
the above studies thus collectively demonstrated that SC09
targeted STAT3 signaling and it induced MM cell apoptosis
in association with endogenous activated STAT3 level.

SC09 had been demonstrated to induce MM cell
apoptosis, to further understand its anti-MM activity,
bone marrow cells isolated from healthy donors and MM
patients were subjected to colony forming assay in the
presence or absence of SC09. The results showed that there
were no difference in colony counts from healthy donors
treated with SC09, however, SC09 significantly decreased

the colony forming units from bone marrow cells of MM
patients (Figure 5A). Therefore, SC09 probably preferred
to inhibit MM progenitors or stem cells.
Next, we evaluated tumor growth from a human
MM xenograft in nude mice after SC09 treatment. As

shown in Figure 5B, oral administration of SC09 at a dose
of 30 mg/kg markedly decreased tumor growth in one
week, and the average of tumor volumes was reduced up
to 78% compared to the vehicle control at the end of the
experiment (20 d). The tumor sizes and weights presented

SC09 enhances MM cell apoptosis induced by
doxorubicin

in a similar manner as the volume on the last day (Figures
5C and D). However, SC09 did not affect mice body
weights throughout the experimental period (Figure 5E).
Blood analysis revealed that SC09 did not markedly
change the counts and measurements of the red blood
cells, white blood cells, platelets and hemoglobin (Figure
5F). These results implicated that SC09 was probably
a minimal toxic agent. Because SC09 was an STAT3
inhibitor, we wondered whether STAT3 activation was
suppressed in tumor tissues. To this end, tumor species
were excised from mice at the end of the experiment
and subjected to p-STAT3 measurement. As shown in
Figures 5G and H, SC09 markedly inhibited STAT3
phosphorylation. This assay thus demonstrated that SC09
delayed MM tumor growth by targeting STAT3 signaling.

Various studies have shown that over-activated
STAT3 contributes chemoresistance to anti-MM
agents, such as doxorubicin (DOX) [13, 14], while
downregulation of STAT3 can enhance tumoricidal
effects [15, 16]. Therefore, we wondered whether
SC09 as a STAT3 inhibitor could enhance cytotoxicity
of DOX against MM. To this end, MM cell lines
NCI-H929 and RPMI-8226 were treated SC09 alone or
in combination with DOX, followed by immunoblotting
assay for apoptosis. As shown in Figures 6A and B, SC09
significantly enhanced MM cell death induced by DOX in
terms of PARP cleavage. DOX at 100 nM induced 20%

DISCUSSION

PARP cleavage in NCI-H929 cells and SC09 induced
50% PARP cleavage at 5 μM, but more than 95% PARP
was cleaved when combined with 5 μM of SC09 and 100
nM of DOX. In RPMI-8226 cells, similar tendency was
observed in PARP cleavage (Figures 6A and B). Because
PARP cleavage is a common marker of apoptosis, this
finding suggested that SC09 enhanced DOX-induced MM
apoptosis and probably overcomes DOX chemoresistance.

The above studies identified SC09 as a novel JAK2STAT3 inhibitor from a high throughput screen using STAT3
recognition element-driving firefly luciferase as the reporter.
Because of its significance in carcinogenesis and
poor clinical outcomes, STAT3 has been developed
as an ideal drug target for various cancer treatment

[17–19]. Currently various inhibitors have been identified,
of which OPB-51602 has been evaluated in Phase I
clinical trial for the treatment of patients with relapsed/
refractory hematological malignancies, including acute
myeloid leukemia (AML), non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma,
MM, or chronic myeloid leukemia [20]. However, in
addition to most common side effects such as nausea,
peripheral sensory neuropathy, and diarrhea, grade 3 or
4 drug-related adverse events were also found in a high
frequency, including neutropenia (20%), leukopenia
(15%), lymphopenia (10%), and thrombocytopenia (10%)
[20]. Relatively, our compound did not show significant
changes in the measurement of red blood cells, white
blood cells, platelets and hemoglobin. In addition, SC09
does not affect the body weights of model mice during
the experimental course although it markedly decreased
tumor growth. In the experimental study with primary
patients' bone marrow cells, SC09 prefers to inhibit
clonogenic growth of MM bone marrow cells but it does
not affect colony forming in healthy donors. Therefore,
SC09 is probably a relative safe agent for the treatment
of MM.
To execute its activity in gene transcription, STAT3
is usually activated by either non-receptor kinases such
as c-Src and JAKs [21] or mitogen-activated protein
kinases (MAPK) such as ERK and p38 [22]. Our study
suggested that SC09 specifically suppresses the JAK2STAT3 signaling pathway. There are four members in the
JAK family including JAK1, JAK2, JAK3 and Tyk2, but
enzymatic analyses showed that SC09 specifically inhibits
JAK2. Of note, SC09 does not inhibit c-Src and other
kinases including AKT, mTOR, ERK and p38, although
these kinases also increase STAT3 activation. Of note,
there are six members in the STAT family of which STAT1,
STAT3 and STAT5 are highly associated with cancer
[23], but SC09 specifically inhibits STAT3 activation
thus inducing cancer cell death. Moreover, SC09 inhibits

transcriptional modularity of STAT3 but not another
nuclear transcription factor NF-κB although both crosstalk in some cancers. Therefore, SC09 specifically inhibits
the JAK2-STAT3 activation and this selective inhibition
is important in anti-cancer drugs because it will reduce
toxicity or adverse effects and increases well tolerance.
In contrast, non-selective agents, such as cytotoxic agents
(e.g. plant alkaloids and anti-tumor antibiotics), raise a
high level of toxicity in healthy tissues and organs.
It is known that both constitutive activation and
cytokine-induced activation of the JAK2-STAT3 signaling
pathway are also critical in MM chemoresistance. IL6, the key cytokine stimulus of the JAK2-STAT3, is
overexpressed in MM cells and contributes resistance to
major anti-MM agents [24], while blockade of the IL-6
signaling transduction by administration of IL-6-specific
monoclonal antibody benefits patients with relapsed or
refractory MM by overcoming certain resistance [25].
Overactivated STAT3 also contributes to resistance in MM
but downregulation of STAT3 overcomes such resistance.
Similar to some other STAT3 inhibitors, SC09 also
overcomes chemoresistance in MM cells and enhances
therapeutic efficacy of other known anti-MM drugs by
suppressing both IL-6-induced and endogenous activity
of STAT3. DOX is a cytotoxic anti-tumor antibiotics and
a major anti-MM agent among the most used anti-MM
regimens. Our study showed that SC09 synergistically acts
on MM cells with DOX, which is clinically significant
because of the emerging resistance to DOX [26].
Notably, a filed patent shows that SC09 is an
inhibitor of cholesterol absorption because SC09 is
claimed to suppress the transcription of ABCA1, a
cholesterol transporter. Cholesterol is an integral part
of the plasma membrane of animal cells to maintain
their structural integrity and modulate their fluidity.
Cholesterol is reported to be associated with survival and
proliferation of MM cells that require more cholesterol

than normal cells [27]. In consistence with this finding,
LDL-cholesterol suppresses MM cell apoptosis in culture
[28] and blockade of the cholesterol transport by an anticancer agent JNJ-26854165 induces MM cell apoptosis
[27]. If SC09 indeed inhibits cholesterol absorption, it
will be of interest because the JAK2-STAT3 pathway is
found to promote ABCA1 expression [29]. Therefore,
it is possible that SC09 as an inhibitor of the JAK2STAT3 inhibits cholesterol absorption by downregulating
ABCA1 expression. It has been reported that several anticholesterol agents display potent anti-cancer activity such
as Statins [30]. However, whether SC09 blocks cholesterol
absorption should be further examined.
In summary, the present study found that SC09 is a
selective JAK2-STAT3 inhibitor and displays potent antiMM activity in both in vitro and in vivo models. Taken into
consideration with its potential inhibition in cholesterol
absorption, it will be of interest to further investigate its
anti-MM activity in association with its anti-STAT3 and
anti-cholesterol activity.

Statistical analysis
Student’s t test was used for comparisons of two
groups in the in vitro studies. All statistical tests were twosided, and when p < 0.05, the difference was considered to
be statistically significant.

Protein kinase activity assay
The effects of SC09 on purified kinases including
c-Src, JAk1, JAK2, JAK3 and Tyk2 were evaluated
using the HotSpot technology and it was performed at
Reaction Biology Corp. (Malvern, PA, USA) as described
previously [36]. In short, assays contained a peptide
substrate, purified recombinant human protein kinases
to be tested, and gamma-labeled ATP, magnesium ion.
Radioactive phosphorylated product was measured and
quantitated via a scintillation counter. Compounds were
tested in a 10-dose IC50 mode with 3-fold serial dilutions
starting at 300 μM. Staurosporine that inhibits many
protein kinases through the prevention of ATP binding to
the active pocket was used as a positive control.

Colony forming assay
A colony forming unit assay was performed to
evaluate clonogenic growth of bone marrow cells from
primary MM patients and healthy donors as described
previously [8]. Briefly, bone marrow cells (6.25 × 105/
mL) treated with SC09 or buffer control for 24 h were
washed and plated in triplicate in standard MethoCult
GF H4434 medium (StemCell Technologies, Vancouver,
BC) as described previously [8]. The number of colonies
containing 20 or more cells was counted for statistical
analysis.

The human myeloma xenograft model was
established in nude mice (Shanghai SLAC Laboratory
Animal Co., Ltd., Shanghai, China) with RPMI-8226
cell line as described previously [8]. When tumors were
palpable, mice were randomly divided into two groups.
One group was orally received SC09 (30 mg/kg) in PBS
containing 10% Tween 80 and 10% DMSO, and another
was given vehicle for continued 20 d. At the same time,
tumor sizes and body weights were measured every other
day. At the end of the experiment, tumors were excised
for immunoblotting and blood samples were collected and
subject to hematological analysis. This animal study was
