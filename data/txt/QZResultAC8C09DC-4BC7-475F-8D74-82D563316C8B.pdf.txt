The Association of Nonalcoholic
Steatohepatitis and Tamoxifen in
Patients With Breast Cancer
Tom Saphner, MD1; Shirley Triest-Robertson, RN, PhD2; Hailun Li, MS3; and Paul Holzman, MD4

BACKGROUND: Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is a form of liver damage that can progress to cirrhosis. NASH is associated with obesity and diabetes. The condition also may be associated with some medications, including tamoxifen. Early case reports and small series have documented NASH in patients who
received tamoxifen. METHODS: The records of patients registered in the St. Vincent Hospital Cancer Registry of Green Bay Wisconsin from January 1, 1992 to December 31, 2000 were reviewed. RESULTS: In total,
1105 patients with breast cancer were evaluated for NASH, and 24 cases of NASH were documented
(2.2%). Seven patients had NASH before their diagnosis of breast cancer, and 17 patients developed NASH
after their diagnosis of breast cancer. In multivariate analysis, the factors associated with NASH were tamoxifen use (odds ratio [OR], 8.2; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.06-63.72), body mass index (BMI) (OR,
1.13; 95% CI, 1.06-1.20), and age (OR, 95% CI, 0.91-0.99). NASH improved after tamoxifen was stopped. After
discontinuation of tamoxifen, transaminase levels returned to normal in 14 of 16 patients. CONCLUSIONS:
NASH was present in 24 of 1105 patients with breast cancer (2.2%). Seven patients had NASH before they
were diagnosed with breast cancer, and 17 patients developed NASH after their diagnosis. NASH
was associated with the use of tamoxifen and improved when tamoxifen was stopped. Cancer

Fatty liver disease generally progresses from nonalcoholic fatty liver disease to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and, potentially, cirrhosis. NASH is identical microscopically to the steatohepatitis noted in
alcoholics. The condition occurs most commonly in patients who are overweight or diabetic. Clinical information suggesting a diagnosis of NASH includes elevation of transaminases and a fatty liver documented by computed tomography (CT) or ultrasound studies. Liver biopsies are diagnostic.1-4
NASH is associated with some medications, possibly including tamoxifen (Nolvadex; AstraZeneca
Pharmaceuticals LP, Wilmington, Del). Early case reports and small series documented NASH in patients
who received tamoxifen.5-14 Imaging studies documented the development of fatty liver in approximately
33% of patients who took tamoxifen.15-26 More sophisticated reports explored the relation between

elevated transaminases and the diagnosis of steatohepatitis in patients with breast cancer27,28 and the effects of
tamoxifen in patients with pre-existing steatohepatitis.29
We retrospectively reviewed a population of patients with
breast cancer to determine the frequency of NASH and
the relation between NASH and the use of tamoxifen.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
The St. Vincent Regional Cancer Center (SVRCC) Tumor Registry was queried for all patients with breast cancer
who were seen by a medical oncologist from January 1,
1992 to December 31, 2000. The SVRCC Tumor Registry was the only registry in the area, and Green Bay Oncology was the only medical oncology clinic in the area during
the time of the review. Patients who had ductal carcinoma
in situ or cancers metastatic to the breast were excluded.
Age of diagnosis was defined as age at the time of definitive surgery. Breast cancers that developed in the same
breast at different times were defined as a recurrence of
the original cancer. Patients who developed breast cancer
in the contralateral breast were considered to have 2 breast
cancers. All patients had 1 breast cancer after January 1,
1992 and before December 31, 2000. A second breast
cancer was counted if the contralateral cancer occurred
during that interval.
Body mass index (BMI) was calculated based on the
following formula: weight in kilograms divided by height
in meters squared. Overweight was defined as a BMI >25
kg/m2 and <30 kg/m2, and obesity was defined as a BMI
>30 kg/m2.
Diabetes was diagnosed if it was documented in the
patent’s initial history of past medical illness. It also was
diagnosed if the patient had a blood sugar level >160 mg/
dL at the time of breast cancer diagnosis or if they were on
diabetes therapy at the time of breast cancer diagnosis.
Alcohol consumption was separated into lower consumption and higher consumption. Lower consumption
was recorded for patients who described their alcohol consumption as 1 drink per day, rare, or occasional. Higher
alcohol consumption was recorded for patients with alcohol consumption described as >1 drink per day, moderate, or frequent.
NASH was diagnosed if it was documented by liver
biopsy or if documented by transaminase levels 2 times
the upper range of normal on 2 occasions and a CT scan
or ultrasound study that demonstrated a fatty liver. All

available pathology slides were reviewed by a pathologist
who did not read the original specimen (P.H.). NASH
was diagnosed before systemic therapy for breast cancer if
any of the criteria were noted before the choice of systemic
therapy. NASH was diagnosed after systemic therapy for
breast cancer if all diagnostic criteria were noted after initiation of systemic therapy.
SPSS statistical software (version 16; SPSS Inc., Chicago, Ill) was used to analyze data. Two-sample t tests and
Fisher exact tests were used to compare patient characteristics between those who developed NASH versus who
did not and between patients who received tamoxifen versus those who did not. Two-sided P values were reported.
Multiple logistic regression analysis using backward
model selection was performed to identify the risk factors
associated with NASH.

RESULTS
The SVRCC Tumor Registry identified 1212 patients
with breast cancer who were seen by a medical oncologist
(Table 1). All clinic charts were available for review. Ductile carcinoma in situ was diagnosed in 103 patients, lymphoma was diagnosed in 2 patients, melanoma was
diagnosed in 1 patient, and prostate cancer metastatic to
the breast was diagnosed in 1 patient. Invasive breast cancer was diagnosed in 1105 patients, unilateral breast cancer was diagnosed in 1055 patients, and bilateral cancer
was diagnosed in 50 patients. The population included
1100 women and 5 men with invasive breast cancer.

Patient characteristics are summarized in Table 2. For
all eligible patients (Table 2, column 1), the mean age at diagnosis of breast cancer was 59 years. The mean weight at
the time of breast cancer diagnosis was 76 kg, the mean
BMI was 29 kg/m2, and diabetes was diagnosed in 128
patients (12%). Low alcohol consumption was reported by
882 patients (80%), high alcohol consumption was
reported by 96 patients (9%), alcohol consumption was
not documented for 127 patients (11%). Statin use was
documented in 85 patients (8%), and 1020 patients (92%)
were not using statins at the time of their breast cancer diagnosis. Tamoxifen was prescribed to 810 patients (73%) and
was not prescribed to 295 patients (27%).
Of the 1105 patients who were studied, 1081 were
not diagnosed with NASH, and 24 patients (2.2%) were

diagnosed with NASH. Seven patients (0.6%) had NASH
before a diagnosis of breast cancer, and 17 patients (1.5%)
were diagnosed after the initiation of systemic therapy.
Patients with and without NASH were assessed further (Table 2, columns 2 and 3). Patients with NASH had
higher weights (mean weight, 94 kg vs 76 kg; P ¼ .005)
and higher BMI than patients without NASH (mean
BMI, 35 kg/m2 vs 29 kg/m2; P < .001). NASH was more
frequent in diabetics. NASH occurred in 9 of 128 patients
(7%) who were diabetic and in 15 of 977 patients (2%)
who were not diabetic (P ¼ .001). The 2 groups did not
differ significantly in terms of alcohol consumption or
statin use.
All 24 patients who had NASH, including 7 patients
who were diagnosed by biopsy, had elevations of
3191

Original Article

transaminases to >2 times the normal limit on 2 occasions. The aspartate aminotransferase (AST) level was >2
times normal in 9 patients, the alanine aminotransferase
(ALT) level was >2 times normal in 2 patients, and both
transaminase levels were >2 times normal in 13 patients.
Seven patients had NASH before a diagnosis of
breast cancer, and the NASH was diagnosed by imaging
and elevated transaminases (Table 2, column 4). The
mean BMI for this group was 34 kg/m2. Diabetes was
diagnosed in 5 of these patients. Alcohol consumption
was low for 6 patients and high for 1 patient. Of these 7
patients, 3 patients did not receive tamoxifen. Of the 4
patients who received tamoxifen, none had evidence of
worsening NASH.
Breast cancer in the absence of NASH was documented in 1098 patients. Of these, 17 patients developed
NASH (Table 2, column 5). Seven patients were diagnosed by liver biopsy, including 2 patients with biopsydocumented NASH and cirrhosis (Fig. 1). Ten patients
had a transaminase levels elevated to >2 times normal on
2 occasions in the presence of a fatty liver on imaging
studies.
Patients who developed NASH after the diagnosis of
breast cancer (n ¼ 17) were younger than the patients
who did not develop NASH (n ¼ 1081) (mean age, 53
years vs 59 years; P ¼ .02). Patients who developed
NASH after a diagnosis of breast cancer were heavier (95
kg vs 76 kg; P < .001) and had a higher mean BMI than
the patients who did not develop NASH (35 kg/m2 vs 29
kg/m2; P < .001). NASH occurred more frequently in
obese patients. NASH was observed in 3 of 655 patients
with a BMI <30 kg/m2 and in 14 of 396 patients with a
BMI 30 kg/m2 (0.5% vs 3.5%, respectively; P<.001).
Obese patients were more at risk of NASH when they
were exposed to tamoxifen. The frequency of NASH in
patients who were exposed to tamoxifen (n ¼ 16) was 3 of
493 patients (0.6%) who had a BMI <30 kg/m2 and 13
of 288 patients (4.5%) who had a BMI >30 kg/m2
(P < .001). Patients who developed NASH were not
more likely to be diabetic (4 of 123 patients vs 13 of 975
patients, respectively; P ¼ .11). NASH was associated
with tamoxifen use. NASH occurred in 16 of 806 patients
(2%) who received tamoxifen and in 1 of 292 patients
(0.3%) patients who did not receive tamoxifen (P ¼ .05).
Because NASH occurred more frequently in
patients who received tamoxifen, the groups that received

tamoxifen and did not receive tamoxifen were examined
further (Table 3). Patients were comparable in all categories, except that patients who received tamoxifen were
older (mean age, 60 years vs 55 years; P < .001).
Multivariate logistic regression analysis indicated
that age, BMI, and tamoxifen were significant factors
associated with NASH (Table 4). The odds of developing
NASH increased 8.2-fold when patients were treated with
tamoxifen, adjusting for age and BMI. The odds of
NASH increased by 13% for every 1-kg/m2 increase in
BMI and decreased by 5% for every 1-year increase in age.
The 17 patients who developed NASH after systemic therapy were reviewed individually: One patient
never received tamoxifen, and 16 patients developed

NASH after they received tamoxifen. The median time
from the start of tamoxifen to documented NASH was 22
months (range, 6-105 months). Tamoxifen was stopped
because of NASH in 11 patients, and tamoxifen was continued after a diagnosis of NASH and was stopped after a
5-year course in 3 patients. Tamoxifen was stopped
because of disease progression in 2 patients.
After discontinuation of tamoxifen (n ¼ 16), transaminase levels tended to improve. Transaminase levels
returned to normal in 14 patients and did not return to
normal in 2 patients. The median time to normalization
of transaminase levels (n ¼ 14) was 23 months, (range, 556 months).

DISCUSSION
We noted NASH in 24 of 1105 patients (2.2%) with
breast cancer. We observed NASH in 7 patients before a
diagnosis of breast cancer (0.6%). After a diagnosis of
breast cancer, NASH was diagnosed in 17 of 1098
patients (1.5%).

patients (0.3%) who did not receive tamoxifen (P ¼ .05).
In multivariate analysis, tamoxifen was a significant factor
associated with the development of NASH (odds ratio,
8.2; 95% confidence interval, 1.06-63.72). Patients who
received tamoxifen were comparable to patients who did
not receive tamoxifen in all categories excluding age:
Patients who received tamoxifen were older. We believe
that the frequency of positive estrogen receptor status goes
up with age and accounts for the increased use of tamoxifen in older patients.
These findings match well with the findings of
Bruno et al, who randomly assigned a prevention population to receive either tamoxifen or placebo.27 Those
authors observed NASH in 32 of 2540 patients (1.2%)
who received tamoxifen and in 18 of 2547 patients
(0.7%) who received placebo (P ¼ .04).
In the current study, 7 patients had NASH before a
diagnosis of breast cancer. Four of those patients received
tamoxifen, and none of them demonstrated evidence of
worsening NASH. This is consistent with the findings of
Elefsiniotis et al., who treated patients with steatosis diagnosed on CT scans with tamoxifen.29 In that study, transaminase levels increased in 26 of 60 patients, but
tamoxifen was ‘‘well tolerated.’’
NASH developed after tamoxifen use in 16 patients.
The median time to development of NASH was 22
months. This is consistent with the findings of Bruno
et al, who noted a median time of 23 months to the development of NASH, and other authors, who noted NASH
between 6 months and 24 months after the start of tamoxifen.7-9,11,13 Bruno et al.27 noted that increases in NASH
attributable to tamoxifen occurred in the first 2 years of
therapy and that the incidence of NASH was not
increased over placebo beyond 2 years.

Transaminase levels tended to return to normal after
tamoxifen was discontinued. We noted a return of transaminase levels to normal in 14 of 16 patients. Resolution
of transaminase elevations were observed by other authors
who noted resolution of transaminase levels 2 months to
32 months after discontinuation of tamoxifen.6,7,9,11
Cirrhosis is a rare complication of tamoxifen therapy. We noted 2 patients with biopsy-documented cirrhosis in 806 patients who took tamoxifen. Bruno et al
documented cirrhosis in 0 of 2540 patients who took tamoxifen. Five additional patients who developed cirrhosis
after they received tamoxifen were identified in case
reports.8,9,12,13
We noted that NASH was associated with obesity
when we analyzed the whole group, including those who
had NASH before the diagnosis of breast cancer
(P < .001) and when we excluded those with NASH
before systemic therapy (P < .001). Obese patients (BMI
>30 kg/m2) were at greater risk of developing NASH
than nonobese patients (BMI <30 kg/m2) when they
were exposed to tamoxifen (P < .001). BMI was associated with NASH in multivariate analysis (odds ratio,
1.13). Bruno et al27 noted that obese patients who
received tamoxifen were more likely to develop NASH
than nonobese patients.
The patients with NASH were younger than the
patients who did not develop NASH (53 years vs 59 years;
P ¼ .02) in univariate analysis and was significant in multivariate analysis (odds ratio ¼ .95; 95% confidence interval, 0.91-0.99). In addition, NASH was more common in
patients who were diabetic when we included those with
NASH before systemic therapy (P ¼ .001) but lost significance when we restricted the analysis to those who did not
have NASH before systemic therapy (P ¼ .11).
NASH was not more common in patients who consumed alcohol. In alcoholic hepatitis, elevations of ALT
are higher than elevations of AST. In this population, we
did not observe a clear pattern of transaminase elevation.
NASH was not more common in patients who took
statins.
The mechanism of NASH is not understood completely and has been the subject of many excellent
reviews.30-35 NASH is associated closely with insulin resistance syndrome (obesity, diabetes, hyperlipidemia). A
2-hit theory has been proposed36: The first hit is postulated to be the accumulation of lipids in the liver, and the
3194

second hit is postulated to be oxidative stress. Tamoxifen
is associated with increased fat in the liver. Very reproducible imaging evidence documented enough fat deposition
in the liver to be detected by CT scans or ultrasound studies in 33% of patients who were treated.15-26 Liu et al
documented that tamoxifen reliably caused fatty liver
(documented by ultrasound studies) and that tamoxifen
increased transaminase levels much less frequently.28 This
also may be consistent with the idea that tamoxifen is associated more with the first hit: the deposition of fat in the
liver. Increased cytokine activity, oxidative stress, and mitochondrial dysfunction have been implicated in the second hit.
In summary, NASH was documented in 2.2% of
patients with breast cancer. Tamoxifen, obesity, and
younger age were associated with NASH in patients with
breast cancer. Four patients who had NASH before a diagnosis of breast cancer did not worsen with the use of tamoxifen, and some of those who developed NASH while
they were on tamoxifen were able to continue the drug.
Transaminases tended to improve when tamoxifen was
stopped, suggesting reversibility.
The practical implications of our observations are as
follows: Although obesity, diabetes, and alcohol are risk
factors for fatty liver disease, they are not necessarily contraindications to a trial of tamoxifen. Routine liver function testing is not required even in patients who have other
risk factors for NASH. If a patient does develop NASH
while on tamoxifen, it is reasonable to stop tamoxifen and
consider other therapy, such as an aromatase inhibitor.
