The mechanism by which AHPN and its analogues induce
apoptosis remains unclear, although numerous potential pathways
have been suggested (11–13). Our binding studies using labeled
AHPN and nuclear extracts suggested the presence of a novel
AHPN receptor (14). To further characterize this potential AHPN
receptor, nuclear proteins, which specifically bound to AHPN linked
to a Sepharose affinity support, were identified; one such protein
was SAP18, a member of the mammalian Sin3A complex (15).
Mammalian Sin3A is a 145-kDa protein, which, through its
interaction with selective proteins and histone deacetylases
(HDAC), represses the expression of a large number of genes.
Three classes of Sin3A-associated proteins have been identified.
The first class of proteins consists of histone/chromatin-modifying
enzymes, such as HDAC1, HDAC2, Swi/Snf, O-linked N-acetylglucosamine methyltransferase, and histone methyltransferases (16).
The second class consists of a large number of DNA-binding
transcription factors, which, when bound to their appropriate
consensus sequences in association with Sin3A, results in gene
repression. Finally, several docking proteins for specific repressor
components are found in the Sin3A complex; these include SAP45
and SAP30, which mediate the association of Sin3A with HDAC1
and HDAC2 and other proteins (16, 17). Recently, the binding of the
orphan nuclear receptor small heterodimer partner (SHP; NR0B2)
to the Sin3A complex has been described (18, 19). SHP is a unique
nuclear receptor, which lacks a DNA-binding domain but contains
a putative ligand-binding domain. SHP has been proposed to
interact with and inhibit the transcriptional activities of other
nuclear proteins (20, 21).
We have now found that AHPN and 3-Cl-AHPC and their
analogues specifically bind to SHP, resulting in the recruitment of a
complex that minimally contains Sin3A, N-CoR, HDAC4, and
HSP90 to the liganded receptor. Moreover, we found that AHPN
and 3-Cl-AHPC enhanced binding of this SHP-Sin3A complex to
the c-Myc promoter, resulting in transcriptional repression. Finally,
both SHP and Sin3A were found to be necessary for AHPN and
3-Cl-AHPC–induced apoptosis, suggesting that this complex is
central to the proapoptotic action of these compounds.

Abstract
6-[3-(1-adamantyl)-4-hydroxyphenyl]-2-naphthalenecarboxylic
acid (CD437/AHPN) and 4-[3-(1-adamantyl)-4-hydroxyphenyl]3-chlorocinnamic acid (3-Cl-AHPC/MM002) are inducers of
apoptosis of malignant cells both in vitro and in vivo.
Numerous mechanisms have been proposed for how these
compounds exert this effect. This report shows that AHPN/
3-Cl-AHPC binds specifically to the orphan nuclear receptor
small heterodimer partner (SHP; NR0B2), and this binding
promotes interaction of the receptor with a corepressor
complex that minimally contains Sin3A, N-CoR, histone
deacetylase 4, and HSP90. Formation of the SHP-Sin3A
complex is essential for the ability of AHPN and 3-Cl-AHPC
to induce apoptosis, as both knockout SHP and knockdown
of Sin3A compromise the proapoptotic activity of these
compounds but not other apoptosis inducers. These results
suggest that AHPN/3-Cl-AHPC and their analogues are SHP
ligands and their induction of apoptosis is mediated by their
binding to the SHP receptor. [Cancer Res 2007;67(1):318–25]

Introduction
The ability of the novel retinoid 6-[3-(1-adamantyl)-4-hydroxyphenyl]-2-naphthalenecarboxylic acid (CD437/AHPN) to induce
apoptosis in several different malignant cells has been well
described (1–4). This observation led to the synthesis and
development of a unique class of compounds, which are potent
inducers of apoptosis and have been called retinoid-related
molecules. The essential pharmacophoric elements in the AHPN
scaffold necessary for apoptosis induction are the hydrophobic
1-adamantyl group, its adjacent hydrogen-donating hydroxyl group,
and a distant carboxylic acid group (5). These compounds have
also been shown to induce cell death in several animal models
(1–7). Although some members of this class may bind and activate
the nuclear retinoic acid receptors (RAR), recent data suggested
that these compounds induce cell death through mechanisms that
do not involve the RARs or the retinoid X receptors (RXR; refs. 8, 9).
Further support for this premise was derived from the observation
that the AHPN analogue 4-[3-(1-adamantyl)-4-hydroxyphenyl]-3chlorocinnamic acid (3-Cl-AHPC/MM002), which binds to but
does not activate the RARs, is a potent inducer of apoptosis (10).

a-Tubulin antibody was from Oncogene Research Products (Boston, MA).
HDAC colorimetric activity assay kit was purchased from Biomol Research
Laboratories, Inc. (Plymouth Meeting, PA), and geldanamycin was obtained
from the NIH (Bethesda, MD).
Cell culture and apoptosis. The human leukemia cell lines HL-60R and
KG-1 and the breast carcinoma cell line MDA-MB-468 were maintained in
RPMI 1640 and DMEM-F12, respectively, as described (10, 23). We have
previously described our generation of the wild-type and SHP knockout
cells (24). Apoptosis was assessed either using acridine orange staining or
using ELISA apoptosis kits obtained from Roche Diagnostic Laboratory
(Indianapolis, IN; ref. 22). The vehicle was 0.1% DMSO and 3-Cl-AHPC and
AHPN were added to a final concentration of 1 Amol/L and [5,5¶-3H2]AHPN
was added to a final concentration of 5 nmol/L unless otherwise stated.
Binding assay. Binding of [5,5¶-3H2]AHPN to glutathione S-transferase
(GST)-SHP and fractionation over G25 Sephadex were done as we have
previously published (14). In the immunoprecipitation binding assays,
specific primary antibodies (1 Ag) were added in 200 to 500 Ag nuclear
extracts in binding buffer containing labeled and nonlabeled ligands and
incubated at 4jC for 2 h. Nuclear extracts were prepared using the method
of Ausubel et al. (25). Protein G-Sepharose Cl-4B (20 AL) was then added
and washed thrice with binding buffer. Washed beads were added directly
to the scintillation liquid or the [5,5¶-3H2]AHPN (CD437) was eluted using
elution buffer (50 mmol/L NaHCO3 and 1% SDS), and the eluate was added
to the scintillation fluid to assess bound radioactivity. In the GST-SHP
binding assays, glutathione-Sepharose bead-bound GST-SHP (0.5–0.7 Ag)
was used in the GST-SHP binding assays.
Radioligand binding data were analyzed using GraphPad Prism 4.0
software (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA). Saturation radioligand
binding data were analyzed by fitting an equation for one site binding
hyperbola to the untransformed data: Y = B max  X / (K D + X).
This describes the binding of a ligand to a receptor that follows the law of
mass action. B max is the maximal binding of [5,5¶-3H2]AHPN and K D is the
concentration of ligand required to reach half-maximal binding. Linear
regression was used to analyze transformed data in Scatchard plots.
Correlation of binding to GST-SHP protein and level of apoptosis
induction were examined using 3-Cl-AHPC and several analogues: (E)-2-4(4-[3-(1-adamantyl)-4-hydroxyphenyl]-3-chlorophenyl)ethylenyl-5-tetrazole
(BI-2002), 5-(4-[3-(1-adamantyl)-4-hydroxyphenyl]-3-chlorophenyl)methylenethiazoleidene-2,4-dione (BI-2003), (E)-3-2-[3-(1-adamantyl)-4hydroxyphenyl]
pyrimidinyl)propenoic acid (BI-2005), (E)-4-[3-(1-adamantyl)-4-hydroxyphenyl]-3-chlorocinnamyl hydroxamic acid (BI-2007), (E)-2-(4-[3-(1-adamantyl)-4-hydroxyphenyl]-3-chlorophenyl)ethyleneboronic acid (BI-2009),
and 3-A-AHPC. [5,5¶-3H2]AHPN was added to a concentration of 5 nmol/L,
whereas competing nonlabeled 3-Cl-AHPC analogues were added to a
final concentration of 50 Amol/L. Each point represents the mean value for
each analogue determined from three independent experiments. The
correlation coefficient and P were determined using Pearson correlation
analysis.
Western blots. Western blots, RNA preparation, and Northern blots were
done as we have previously described (26).
HDAC assay. Histone deacetylation activation assays were done using
the HDAC colorimetric assay kit and the manufacturer’s instructions.
Sin3A was immunoprecipitated from 500 Ag nuclear extracts and added to
1 mmol/L substrate for each HDAC activation assay in 96-well microtiter
plates; the HDAC activity was measured at 405 nm in a microtiter plate
reader.
Small interfering RNA transfection. Cells were transfected with small
interfering RNA (siRNA) using Oligofectamine and Oligofectamine plus
reagent according to Elbashir et al. (27) and the manufacturer’s instructions.
The cells were incubated with two primers, 21-nucleotide RNA with 3¶-dAA
overhangs synthesized by Dharmacon RNA Technology (Dharmacon
Research, Lafayette, CO). The primer sequences were 5¶-GGUUGCUCGUCUCUUUAAAAA-3¶ (mS3-1) and 5¶-UUAUCGUUGUGAAGAUGAAAA-3¶
(mS3-2) corresponding to base pair start from 1,342 to 2,086 of the coding
sequence of the Sin3A gene (PubMed accession no. NM_015477). The siRNA
sequences for human SHP were 5¶-GCAGUGGCUUCAAUGCUGUUAA-3¶
(si-SHP1) and 5¶-CUAUGUGCACCUCAUCGCA-3¶ (si-SHP2). Control cells

were treated with nontargeting siRNA control duplex sequence from
Dharmacon Research. Cells were harvested 24, 48, and 72 h following the
transfection to assess protein levels by Western blot. Cells were treated
with 1 Amol/L 3-Cl-AHPC after 24 h of transfection and harvested 24 and
48 h after incubation with 1 Amol/L 3-Cl-AHPC for protein and apoptosis
assays.
Chromatin immunoprecipitation assay. KG-1 and MDA-MB-468 cells
were treated with 1 Amol/L 3-Cl-AHPC for 24 h and proteins were crosslinked to DNA by adding formaldehyde ( final concentration of 1%) to the
culture medium and fixing at room temperature for 10 min followed by
washing twice with cold PBS and then chromatin immunoprecipitation
(ChIP) assays were done using a modified procedures of Weinmann et al.
(28). The antibody/protein/DNA complex was eluted with elution
buffer (50 mmol/L NaHCO3, 1% SDS), and the cross-link was reversed by
addition of NaCl to a final concentration of 250 mmol/L, 5 AL proteinase K
(15 mg/mL) and 10 Ag RNaseA and incubated at 65jC overnight. The
samples were extracted with phenol-chloroform-isoamylalcohol (25:24:1)
and then chloroform-isoamylalcohol (24:1). The DNA was precipitated with
3 mol/L sodium acetate (pH 5.3; 1:10 by volume) and 5 Ag glycogen, and
1 mL of ethanol precipitate was resuspended with Tris-EDTA buffer and
analyzed by PCR. c-Myc primers were designed from the promoter region
exon 1 ( forward, 5¶-ATAATGCGAGGGTCTGGA-3¶; reverse, 5¶-ATACTCAGCHCGATCCCT-3¶) and from the primer set specific for SHP ( forward,
5¶-CCCAAGATGCTGTGACCTTT-3¶; reverse, 5¶-CCAGAAGGACTCCAGACAGC-3¶). The primer sequences for h-actin were 5¶-TCCTTCCTGGGCATGGAG-3¶ ( forward) and 5¶-AGGAGGAGCAATGATCTT-3¶ (reverse).

Results
AHPN binds to a Sin3A complex(es). We previously showed
specific binding of [5,5¶-3H2]AHPN to nuclear extracts of several
malignant cells (14). AHPN binding to specific nuclear proteins was
examined using an AHPN affinity column. One of the proteins
isolated from this column was SAP18, a member of the Sin3A
complex (15). [5,5¶-3H2]AHPN binding to a Sin3A complex was
therefore assessed using nuclear extracts from the HL-60 and
MDA-MB-468 cell lines as described in Fig. 1. [5,5¶-3H2]AHPN was
found to bind to the Sin3A complex in a manner that was inhibited
by unlabeled AHPN, 3-Cl-AHPC, and the AHPN analogue 3-A-AHPC
(Fig. 1A). The specificity of [5,5¶-3H2]AHPN binding to the Sin3A
complex was further shown by the lack of [5,5¶-3H2]AHPN binding
to nuclear extracts depleted of Sin3A as well as by the lack of
binding to other nuclear proteins, such as the deacetylase SIRT1
and GADD45 (Fig. 1B and C). [5,5¶-3H2]AHPN coimmunoprecipitated with N-CoR in MDA-MB-468 where N-CoR was found
associated with the Sin3A complex (see Figs. 1C and 2 below),
but [5,5¶-3H2]AHPN did not coimmunoprecipitate with N-CoR in
KG-1 cells where N-CoR was not found in the Sin3A complex
(Fig. 1D, inset). Thus, [5,5¶-3H2]AHPN binding to N-CoR was
dependent on N-CoR being part of the Sin3A complex N-CoR.
[5,5¶-3H2]AHPN binding to the Sin3A complex was only found when
conducted in the presence of nuclear extracts; [5,5¶-3H2]AHPN did
not display specific binding to the Sin3A complex when it was
added after immunoprecipitation of Sin3A, implying that [5,5¶-3H2]
AHPN binding to the Sin3A complex requires the association of
other nuclear factors with the Sin3A complex (Fig. 1C, lane 5).
AHPN and 3-Cl-AHPC recruit proteins to the Sin3A complex
and enhances Sin3A-associated HDAC activity. Several
approaches were used to determine whether exposure of cells or
cell extracts to AHPN or 3-Cl-AHPC resulted in the recruitment
of proteins to a Sin3A complex. MDA-MB-468 nuclear extract
exposure to 3-Cl-AHPC or AHPN resulted in the recruitment of
several proteins to Sin3A, including HDAC4, HSP90, N-CoR, and the

modification. AHPN and 3-Cl-AHPC exposure also resulted in a 1.5and 2-fold increased Sin3A expression in KG-1 and MDA-MB-468
cells, respectively (Fig. 2D).
Sin3A complexes repress gene expression through HDAC1and HDAC2-mediated histone deacetylation (29). We therefore
assessed whether 3-Cl-AHPC–mediated modification of the Sin3A
complex resulted in the modulation of the Sin3A-associated HDAC
activities. Exposure of MDA-MB-468 cells to 3-Cl-AHPC resulted

N-CoR components TBL1 and GPS2, as identified by silver staining
and Western blot (Fig. 2A and B; Supplementary Fig. S2). When
MDA-MB-468 cells were incubated with either vehicle or 3-ClAHPC for varying times following which the Sin3A complex was
immunoprecipitated and Western blots were done, AHPN or 3-ClAHPC exposure also resulted in Sin3A recruitment of HDAC4,
HSP90, and N-CoR (Fig. 2C). Thus, exposure of nuclear extracts or
whole cells to AHPN or 3-Cl-AHPC resulted in Sin3A complex

and with high affinity (K D of 2.88 + 0.57 nmol/L; Fig. 4A) to
recombinant SHP in a manner that was inhibited by 3-Cl-AHPC.
Binding of [3H]trans-retinoic acid ([3H]tRA) to SHP was not
observed (Fig. 4B). Preincubation of GST-SHP with SHP antibody
totally inhibited [5,5¶-3H2]AHPN binding to SHP (data not shown).
In addition, specific [5,5¶-3H2]AHPN binding to GST-SHP was
observed when GST-SHP was incubated with [5,5¶-3H2]AHPN, and
then the GST-SHP was fractionated over a G25 column (Fig. 4C).
[5,5¶-3H2]AHPN binding coeluted with GST-SHP; this binding was
inhibited by excess unlabeled 3-Cl-AHPC. No binding was noted
if [5,5¶-3H2]AHPN was incubated with only GST (data not shown).
Thus, [5,5¶-3H2]AHPN and 3-Cl-AHPC seem to be ligands for SHP,
whereas the classic retinoid tRA is not.
The ability of several 3-Cl-AHPC analogues to inhibit
[5,5¶-3H2]AHPN binding to SHP was compared with their ability
to induce apoptosis. A strong correlation of R = 0.96 (P = 0.002) was
found between binding to SHP as assessed by the inhibition of
[5,5¶-3H2]AHPN binding to SHP and the induction of apoptosis
(Fig. 4D). Furthermore, the 3-Cl-AHPC analogues 3-A-AHPC and
BI-2002, which block AHPN- and 3-Cl-AHPC–mediated apoptosis,
also inhibited [5,5¶-3H2]AHPN binding to SHP, suggesting that
AHPN and 3-Cl-AHPC binding to SHP plays an important role in
AHPN/3-Cl-AHPC–mediated apoptosis (Fig. 4D; ref. 22).
SHP and Sin3A play essential roles in 3-Cl-AHPC–mediated
apoptosis and inhibition of c-Myc expression. Exposure of cells
to 3-Cl-AHPC resulted in the increased association of SHP as well
as N-CoR, HDAC4, and HSP90 with Sin3A (Figs. 2 and 5A). The
addition to cells of 3-A-AHPC, which blocks [5,5¶-3H2]AHPN
binding to SHP (Fig. 4D), also inhibited 3-Cl-AHPC–enhanced
SHP association with the Sin3A complex (Fig. 5B) and blocked
3-Cl-AHPC–mediated apoptosis as we have previously shown (22).
We speculated that if 3-Cl-AHPC binding to SHP plays an
important role in 3-Cl-AHPC–mediated apoptosis, loss of SHP

in a 2-fold increase of HDAC activity in Sin3A immunoprecipitates
(Fig. 3A). This increase in Sin3A-associated HDAC activity may be
secondary to the 3-Cl-AHPC increase in Sin3A expression.
HSP90 ATPase activity is essential for 3-Cl-AHPC binding to
Sin3A- and 3-Cl-AHPC–induced apoptosis. 3-Cl-AHPC exposure
resulted in the recruitment of HSP90 to the Sin3A complex (Fig. 2).
We used the HSP90 inhibitor geldanamycin to further delineate
the role of HSP90 in AHPN and 3-Cl-AHPC binding to Sin3A and
the AHPN- and 3-Cl-AHPC-mediated increase in Sin3A-associated
HDAC activity and apoptosis. Geldanamycin pretreatment of
cells resulted in inhibition of [5,5¶-3H2]AHPN binding to the Sin3A
complex as well as the 3-Cl-AHPC-mediated increase in HDAC
activity and apoptosis (Fig. 3A–C). Geldanamycin did not inhibit
HSP90 Sin3A binding (data not shown).
In view of AHPN and 3-Cl-AHPC binding to Sin3A, we examined
the effect of loss of Sin3A expression on 3-Cl-AHPC–mediated
apoptosis to determine the role of Sin3A in this process. Sin3A
expression was markedly reduced in cells using siRNA and
resulted in a significant inhibition of 3-Cl-AHPC–mediated apoptosis, suggesting a role for this complex in this process (Fig. 3D;
Supplementary Fig. S3).
3-Cl-AHPC binds SHP, resulting in enhanced SHP-Sin3A
association, which is essential for 3-Cl-AHPC binding to Sin3A
complex and 3-Cl-AHPC–mediated apoptosis. The orphan
receptor SHP has recently been found to be a member of the
Sin3A complex, and it has been speculated that SHP-mediated
repression of gene expression may be through its Sin3A association
(18). Because we found that [5,5¶-3H2]AHPN and 3-Cl-AHPC bound
to a Sin3A complex but only in the presence of the nuclear extract,
we speculated that [5,5¶-3H2]AHPN/3-Cl-AHPC may be binding to
SHP with subsequent recruitment of the Sin3A complex to
the liganded receptor. We therefore assessed binding of [5,5¶-3H2]
AHPN to recombinant SHP. [5,5¶-3H2]AHPN bound specifically

(16). Binding to Sin3A occurs through its amphipathic [paired
amphipathic helix (PAH)] domains. Sin3A possesses four PAH
domains (PAH1, PAH2, PAH3, and PAH4), and evidence suggests
that they are not redundant but that each domain binds a unique
protein(s) (30, 31); whereas PAH2 is responsible for the binding
of the c-Myc family member Mad, PAH3 binds the corepressor
N-CoR (30, 31). The Sin3A complex inhibits the transcription of
a large number of genes through its unique binding of selective
nuclear transcription factors, corepressors, as well as HDACs and
methylases (30). Although Sin3A does not directly bind to DNA, it
is recruited to promoter templates through its binding to other
transcription factors harboring sequence-specific DNA-binding
activity (32). We have found that 3-Cl-AHPC exposure resulted in
enhanced binding of several proteins to the Sin3A complex that is
involved in transcriptional repression as well as the nuclear orphan
receptor SHP. We hypothesize that the initial event in this process
is the binding of 3-Cl-AHPC or 3-Cl-AHPC to SHP. We have shown
that SHP tightly binds AHPN with a K D of 2.8 nmol/L, which is
similar to that noted for the binding of AHPN by nuclear extracts
(14). Moreover, we found that both SHP and Sin3A play key roles
in the proapoptotic activities of AHPN and 3-Cl-AHPC. Loss of
Sin3A expression in MDA-MB-468 cells and SHP expression in
MDA-MB-468 and MEF cells inhibits 3-Cl-AHPC–mediated apoptosis. Interestingly, MEF cells display increased sensitivity to 3-ClAHPC-mediated apoptosis. Furthermore, 3-Cl-AHPC analogues,
which inhibit 3-Cl-AHPC-mediated apoptosis, also block AHPN
binding to SHP and SHP binding to the Sin3A complex. Considered
together, these results strongly suggest that SHP binding by
3-Cl-AHPC and the subsequent recruitment of a Sin3A-containing
complex to the ligand-bound receptor play an important role in
3-Cl-AHPC–mediated apoptosis.
Interaction of SHP with a Sin3A complex has been previously
documented in hepatocytes and has been shown to occur through
the repression domain of the orphan receptor (18). More importantly, this association of SHP with Sin3A in these cells results in

expression should inhibit 3-Cl-AHPC–mediated apoptosis. We
therefore examined 3-Cl-AHPC–mediated apoptosis in MDAMB-468 cells with loss of SHP expression as well as in SHP-null
mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF; ref. 24). SHP expression was
reduced 50% to 60% in MDA-MB-468 cells using siRNA (Supplementary Fig. S5). Knockdown of SHP in MDA-MB-468 cells and
knockout of SHP in the MEF cells attenuated [5,5¶-3H2]AHPN
binding to Sin3A and resulted in resistance of the corresponding
cells to 3-Cl-AHPC–mediated apoptosis (Fig. 5C and D). However,
these manipulations of SHP did not alter apoptosis induction by
the proteasome inhibitor N-acetyl-L-leucinyl-L-leucinyl-norleucinal
(LLnL), Adriamycin, or the inhibitor of nuclear factor-nB (NF-nB)
activation kamebakaurin (Fig. 5D). Although decreased, a low
level of 3-Cl-AHPC–mediated apoptosis was still noted in the
SHP knockout MEF cells. The mechanism for 3-Cl-AHPC–
mediated apoptosis independent of SHP expression remains to
be delineated.
Sin3A inhibits gene expression at the transcriptional level
through its increased binding to specific promoters (16, 30, 31).
Gene array studies in several cell types showed a rapid inhibition
of c-Myc expression following 3-Cl-AHPC exposure (data not
shown). Exposure of MDA-MB-468 and KG-1 cells to 3-Cl-AHPC
resulted in inhibition of c-Myc protein and mRNA expression
within 6 h (Fig. 6A and B). 3-Cl-AHPC inhibition of c-Myc
transcription in both cell types is associated with 3-Cl-AHPC–
mediated enhanced binding of Sin3A and SHP to the c-Myc
promoter as shown by ChIP assay (Fig. 6C and D). That this
3-Cl-AHPC–mediated SHP/Sin3A binding to the c-Myc promoter
is specific is shown by a lack of 3-Cl-AHPC–increased Sin3A
binding to the actin promoter (Fig. 6C).

Discussion
The Sin3A protein serves as the scaffold to which several
proteins bind with the subsequent formation of the Sin3A complex

well as its binding to its consensus sequence in the mouse
mammary tumor virus promoter (44). We have found that the
addition of geldanamycin to 3-Cl-AHPC–exposed cells inhibited
3-Cl-AHPC binding to the Sin3A complex as well as 3-ClAHPC–mediated induction of Sin3A-associated HDAC activity
and apoptosis. Gene repression can be mediated through Sin3Aassociated HDAC1- and HDAC2-mediated deacetylation of histones. The fact that HSP90 seems to be involved with 3-Cl-AHPC
binding to Sin3A and the subsequent enhancement of Sin3Aassociated HDAC activity suggests that HSP90 plays an important
role in 3-Cl-AHPC-induced apoptosis. Studies to assess whether
geldanamycin exposure inhibits 3-Cl-AHPC/Sin3A–mediated gene
expression are under way.
AHPN and its analogues have been shown to have a wide variety
of effects on malignant cells before the induction of apoptosis
(45, 46). Diverse mechanisms have been proposed to more clearly
define the pathway(s) through which AHPN and its analogues exert
their effects. These include the induction of specific proteins,
inhibition of the mitogen-activated protein kinase-1 phosphatase
resulting in c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase kinase activation, induction
of DNA adducts, translocation of the nuclear transcription factor
TR3 to mitochondria, and TR3 binding to Bcl-2 as well other
proposed mechanisms (13, 47, 48). How AHPN/3-Cl-AHPC exerts
these diverse effects in malignant cells is not clear. Although AHPN
activates RARg and 3-Cl-AHPC does not, they seem to exhibit
similar mechanisms of action in all aspects we have examined.
In the present study, we have shown that AHPN, 3-Cl-AHPC, and
their analogues bind to SHP and holo-SHP binds subsequently to a
Sin3A complex that is likely involved in transcriptional repression.
Whether AHPN/3-Cl-AHPC binding to SHP and the Sin3A complex
is responsible for all of the documented effects of AHPN/3-ClAHPC on cellular function remains to be clarified. However, our
results strongly suggest that SHP and Sin3A play an important role
in AHPN/3-Cl-AHPC–mediated apoptosis. Studies to determine the

the recruitment of several proteins to the complex, association
of the modified complex to the CYP7A1 gene promoter, and
subsequent transcriptional repression (18).
SHP has been shown to interact with several nuclear receptors,
including the thyroid hormone receptor, RAR, RXR, estrogen
receptor, glucocorticoid receptor, and hepatocyte nuclear receptors
FXR and LRH-1 (27). Interaction between SHP and these receptors
is enhanced by the presence of their cognate ligand and results
in SHP-mediated down-regulation of their respective signaling
pathways (33). In addition, SHP is able to interact with Nur77
and inhibit transcriptional activation mediated by this orphan
receptor (34). In contrast, SHP binding to the peroxisome-activated
receptors a and g as well as the transcriptional factor NF-nB
results in their activation (35, 36). Although no ligand for SHP has
been identified, recent SHP modeling studies by Macchiarulo et al.
(37) suggest the presence of a phospholipid-binding site. SHP
mRNA expression has been found in several tissues and cell lines.
SHP protein is expressed in liver, heart, kidney, small intestine,
stomach, spleen, adrenal, colon, breast adipose tissue, brain, epididymis, prostate, uterus, bladder, lung, and pancreas (20, 38–40).
SHP expression is abundant in murine macrophage cell line (36)
and also increases during monocytic differentiation with exposure
of HL-60R leukemia cells to a 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13acetate response element (41).
In addition to SHP, 3-Cl-AHPC exposure results in the increased
association of HSP90 with Sin3A. Several investigators have now
shown that HSP90 is associated with and modulates the activity
of a variety of steroid, hormone receptors (42). The role of HSP90
in the ability of these receptors to bind their respective ligands
and activate gene transcription is controversial. Several groups
have shown that the ligand-binding domain of the glucocorticoid
receptor must be bound to HSP90 for receptor high-affinity ligand
binding (43). Incubation of cells with the specific HSP90 inhibitor
geldanamycin blocked glucocorticoid receptor ligand binding as

of SHP expression specifically inhibits
3-Cl-AHPC–mediated (1 Amol/L) apoptosis in

si-SHP2) and SHP knockout MEF cells but
