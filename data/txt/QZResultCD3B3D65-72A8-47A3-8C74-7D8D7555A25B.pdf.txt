BACKGROUND: Adult ‘‘translocation’’ renal cell carcinoma (RCC), bearing transcription factor E3 (TFE3) gene fusions
at Xp11.2, is a recently recognized, unique entity for which prognosis and therapy remain poorly understood. In the
current study, the authors investigated the effect of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-targeted therapy in
this distinct subtype of RCC. METHODS: A retrospective review was conducted to describe the clinical characteristics
and outcome of adult patients with metastatic Xp11.2 RCC who had strong TFE3 nuclear immunostaining and
received anti-VEGF therapy. Tumor response to anti-VEGF therapy was evaluated using Response Evaluation Criteria
in Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to estimate progression-free survival (PFS) and
overall survival (OS) distributions. RESULTS: Fifteen patients were identified, of whom 10, 3, and 2 received sunitinib,
sorafenib, and monoclonal anti-VEGF antibodies, respectively. The median follow-up was 19.1 months, the median age
of the patients was 41 years, and the female:male ratio was 4:1. Initial histologic description included clear cell (n ¼ 8
patients), papillary (n ¼ 1 patient), or mixed clear cell/papillary RCC (n ¼ 6 patients). Five patients had received prior
systemic therapy. Five patients had undergone fluorescent in situ hybridization analysis and all demonstrated a translocation involving chromosome Xp11.2. When treated with VEGF-targeted therapy, 3 patients achieved a partial
response, 7 patients had stable disease, and 5 patients developed progressive disease. The median PFS and OS of
the entire cohort were 7.1 months and 14.3 months, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Adult-onset, translocation-associated metastatic RCC is an aggressive disease that affects a younger population of patients with a female predominance. In the current study, VEGF-targeted agents appeared to demonstrate some efficacy. Cancer 2010;116:5219–25.

KEYWORDS: vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), sunitinib, adult translocation renal cell carcinoma (RCC),

Translocation carcinomas of the kidney were first described in children and adolescents and are usually considered

indolent, even if diagnosed at an advanced stage in this population of patients.1 Various cytogenetic translocations have
been shown to be tumor specific, with the vast majority of these translocations involving the transcription factor E3
(TFE3) gene located on Xp11.2. The TFE3 protein encoded by this gene interacts with transcription regulators such as
E2F3, SMAD3, and lymphoid enhancer-binding factor-1 (LEF-1), and is involved in transforming growth factor (TGF)beta-induced transcription, playing important roles in cell growth, proliferation, and osteoclast and macrophage differentiation.2 The most common translocations involve an alveolar soft part sarcoma locus (ASPL)-TFE3 or renal cell carcinoma (RCC) papillary 1 gene (PRCC)-TFE3 fusion.2,3
Xp11 translocation RCCs have recently been included as a separate entity in the 2004 World Health Organization
classification of renal tumors.4 Although these tumors comprise at least one-third of pediatric RCCs, to our knowledge far
fewer adult cases have been reported.5 Given the degree to which these tumors overlap morphologically with clear cell

and/or papillary RCC, many cases of adult Xp11.2 translocation RCC may be misclassified as clear cell or papillary RCC, and thus the true incidence of this entity may
in fact be underestimated.6 In the past few years, several
reports of adults with translocation RCC having an
aggressive clinical course have emerged.7-9
An improved understanding of the molecular pathways implicated in the pathogenesis of RCC has led to the
development of specific targeted therapies to treat this disease. Conventional/clear cell RCC is characterized by
inactivation of the von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) tumor suppressor gene, which results in the dysregulation of hypoxia
response genes, including an overproduction of vascular
endothelial growth factor (VEGF), which promotes tumor growth and progression. In patients with advanced
RCC, substantial clinical activity has been reported with
VEGF inhibition, leading the US Food and Drug Administration to approve multiple drugs such as sunitinib, sorafenib, pazopanib, and bevacizumab.10 Clinical trials using
these drugs mainly include patients with clear cell histology, based on the role of the VHL gene in this subtype,
although clinical activity has been reported in patients
with non-clear cell histology.11,12
To our knowledge, there are no established effective
therapies for metastatic Xp11.2 translocation RCC,
although single case reports have recently reported a
response to sunitinib.13,14 Therefore, we performed a retrospective multicenter review of patients with advanced
translocation RCC who were treated with VEGF-targeted
therapy to assess the clinical features and treatment outcome of this particular RCC subtype.

such as blood counts and chemistries, including lactate dehydrogenase, allowing them to be stratified into the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC) risk
groups15 and the recent prognostic groups by Heng
et al.16 In addition, pretreatment tumor status was evaluated with computed tomography scans of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis. Data collected included standard
pretreatment disease characteristics, baseline biochemical
parameters, prior non-VEGF-targeted therapies, first date
of treatment, best response to treatment including tumor
measurement data, date of disease progression, and date
of death or last follow-up. This study was approved by the
Institutional Review Board at each institution.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Pathologic Analysis
Slides were retrieved and reviewed by expert genitourinary
pathologists from each corresponding institution. In cases
with a suspicious diagnosis based on morphology, the
incidence of Xp11.2 translocation RCC was investigated
by immunostaining for TFE3, a highly sensitive (>95%)
and specific (>95%) marker of Xp11.2 translocation carcinomas.6 For immunohistochemistry (IHC), slides were
incubated with the polyclonal antibody to TFE3 (Clone
P-16, dilution of 1:600; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa
Cruz, Calif) after antigen retrieval. Cases were included if
they demonstrated only strong nuclear immunoreactivity
(readily apparent at low-power magnification [40]) for
TFE3 by IHC. When available, cytogenetic analysis and/
or fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) was performed
using home-brew, dual-color, break-apart probes containing RP11-528A24 (specific for the 50 end of TFE3) and
RP11-8A2 (specific for the 30 end of TFE3).17

Patient Cohort
Patients aged 18 years with metastatic RCC who underwent clinical evaluation at 4 cancer centers in the United
States (Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Karmanos Cancer Institute, and The
University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center) and
were treated with VEGF-targeted agents between 2005
and 2009 were the subjects of this retrospective review.
Patients had not received prior VEGF-targeted therapy,
and had to have pathology slides available for review to be
included in this study. A total of 15 patients were identified who met these parameters.
At the time of the initiation of anti-VEGF treatment, all but 1 patient had detailed history and physical
examinations, as well as baseline laboratory parameters

Statistical Analysis
Objective response was defined using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) for all patients.18
Median survival was defined as the time from the initiation of treatment to the date of death or censoring at the
time of last follow-up. Progression-free survival (PFS) was
defined from the initiation of treatment to the date of disease progression, death, or censoring at the time of last follow-up. Survival distributions were estimated using the
Kaplan-Meier method.19 All tests of statistical significance
were 2-sided. All data analyses were conducted using SAS
statistical software (version 9.2; SAS Institute, Inc, Cary,
NC).

RESULTS
Patient Characteristics
Table 1 summarizes patient characteristics. Fifteen
patients were included in this analysis. The median age at
the time of the initiation of therapy was 41 years (range,
18-65 years). The initial stage of disease was stage I in 2
patients (13%), stage II in 1 patient (7%), stage III in 4
patients (27%), and stage IV in 8 patients (53%). Twelve
of the 15 patients (80%) were female. Initial histologic
classification of the renal tumors included clear cell (n ¼ 8
patients), papillary (n ¼ 1 patient), or mixed clear cell/
papillary (n ¼ 6 patients) RCC. The median tumor size at
the time of surgery was 8 cm (range, 2-11.4 cm). Onethird of patients had received prior systemic therapy (2
had been treated with immunotherapy with high-dose
interleukin-2, 1 patient had received chemotherapy, 1
patient had received a vaccine, and 1 patient had been
treated with temsirolimus). One of the patients, who
received immunotherapy, was treated subsequently with a
MET inhibitor (ARQ-197). Twelve patients (80%) had
undergone a prior nephrectomy. The most common sites
of metastatic disease included the lymph nodes (13 of 15
patients; 87%), bone (7 of 15 patients; 47%), lung (6 of
15 patients; 40%), liver (3 of 15 patients; 20%) and brain
(2 of 15 patients; 13%). Two or more sites of metastatic
disease at the time of the initiation of therapy were found
in 12 of 15 (80%) patients. At the time of therapy initiation, 11 patients (73%) were found to have an Eastern
Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 or
1. The median time from the initial diagnosis to metastatic disease was 3.2 months (range, 0-30.2 months).
Only 3 patients presented with metastatic disease >1 year
after their initial RCC diagnosis. MSKCC and Heng risk
groups were favorable, intermediate, poor, and missing in
2, 9, 3, and 1 patients and in 2, 10, 2, and 1 patients,
respectively.
Patients received the oral small molecules multityrosine kinase inhibitors sunitinib (N ¼ 10 patients) and sorafenib (n ¼ 3 patients), or the intravenous monoclonal
antibodies against the VEGF ligand (bevacizumab; n ¼ 1
patient) or against the VEGF receptor (ramucirumab;
n ¼ 1 patient).

chromosome aberrations), 1 sample exhibited a t(X;3),
and 2 karyotypes were interpreted as being normal/nondiagnostic (1-2 grown culture cells metaphases only).
FISH analysis was performed in 5 cases and all 5 (including 1 case with ‘‘normal cytogenetics’’) demonstrated a
translocation involving the X chromosome (Fig. 1).
Treatment Outcome
Using RECIST criteria, 3 patients had an objective
response, for an overall response rate of 20%. All responders who were treated with sunitinib (n ¼ 1 patient), sorafenib (n ¼ 1 patient), and ramucirumab (n ¼ 1 patient)
achieved a partial response(PR). The duration of response
was 7 months, 13 months, and 27 months, respectively.
Seven patients achieved stable disease, 4 of whom had tumor shrinkage ranging from 9% to 24%. The median
tumor shrinkage was 4.5% (range, 48% shrinkage to
67% growth).
Figure 2 shows survival distributions for the 15
patients. At a median follow-up of 19.1 months, the median PFS and OS for the entire cohort were 7.1 months
(95% confidence interval [95% CI], 1.7-27 months) and
14.3 months (95% CI, 2.7 months to not reached),
respectively. All deaths were related to disease. There were
no differences with regard to PFS or OS (P > .2) noted
between patients treated with sunitinib versus those not
treated with sunitinib; however, these results should be
viewed with caution because of the small numbers of
patients studied and the heavy censoring.

sirolimus, an intravenous mammalian target of rapamycin
(mTOR) inhibitor, and all were found to have developed
progressive disease at their first restaging evaluation.
Before receiving VEGF-targeted therapy, none of the
patients who received immunotherapy, vaccination, or
chemotherapy experienced a response. The patient who
received a MET inhibitor experienced stable disease for
7 months before developing disease progression.

DISCUSSION
To our knowledge, this is 1 of the largest studies published
to date reporting on targeted therapy for adult patients
with metastatic translocation Xp11.2 RCC. Although several targeted agents have been approved for the treatment
of advanced RCC, allowing oncologists to treat all RCC
subtypes, clinical trials have for the most part been conducted in patients with clear cell histology (the most common subtype), with some limited experience reported in

patients with non-clear cell subtypes such as papillary and
chromophobe RCC.11 Prior reports from the literature
suggest that patients with Xp11.2 translocation RCC do
not benefit from immunotherapy or chemotherapy,
although these studies included <5 patients with
advanced disease. To our knowledge, to date there has not
been a reported case with a significant response to those
therapies.9,20,21 In contrast, 2 case reports13,14 have shown
that sunitinib may have significant activity in patients
with translocation RCC.
The results of the current study demonstrated that
VEGF-targeted therapy can be of benefit in adults with
metastatic Xp11.2 RCC, as evidenced by a response rate
of 20% and a median PFS of 7.1 months. However, based
on the small number of patients in the current study and
the finding that responses occurred with 3 different drugs,
it is impossible to make definitive conclusions regarding
the best VEGF-targeted agent for patients with this
disease.
A recent multicenter study from several French centers reported on 21 patients with metastatic Xp11.2 RCC
who were treated with VEGF and mTOR-targeted therapies.22 Patients treated with sunitinib were found to have
a median PFS of 8.2 months if they received therapy
before treatment with sunitinib, and 11 months if they
were previously treatment-naive. Patients treated with sorafenib had a median PFS of 6 months, whereas patients
treated with temsirolimus had a median PFS of 3 months.
Seven patients (33%) experienced objective responses. All
patients treated with sunitinib and 1 patient treated with
temsirolimus achieved responses. With a median followup of 19 months, the median OS was reported to be 27
months.22 The efficacy data in the French series are somewhat higher than in the current report, which could be
because of case selection bias or the fact that they did not
restrict their study to adult patients. In fact, 5 patients in
the French series (24%) were aged <18 years. As shown in
multiple reports, patients with adult Xp11.2 RCC tend to
have a more aggressive disease course than their pediatric
counterparts.7,9
In the current series, we confirmed that advanced
translocation RCC tends to have a strong female predominance and a high frequency of lymph node metastases,
findings that are consistent with those of other large
reports.5,20 The current series, as well as others, did not
address the incidence of Xp11.2 RCC in adults. The best
way to do so would be to screen a large consecutive series
of cases placed on a tissue microarray using IHC staining
for TFE3.One Japanese study indicated that the incidence

of Xp11 RCC in adults is <5%.21 At this rate, one would
predict that adult cases will ultimately outnumber pediatric cases, given that approximately 40,000 cases of adult
RCC occur each year in the United States.23 Moreover, it
is likely that Xp11.2/TFE3 RCC continues to be underdiagnosed in adults because of its morphologic overlap
with the more common RCC subtypes (clear cell and papillary) and because cytogenetic analysis is not routinely
performed for all adult renal tumors as it is in those occurring in children. This point is illustrated in a case from the
current series, in which a diagnosis of a mixed clear cell/
papillary RCC was made before a TFE3 stain and FISH
analysis confirmed the diagnosis of adult Xp11.2 RCC.
The tumor was heterogeneous, comprised of epithelioid
cells with prominent nucleoli and voluminous clear to eosinophilic cytoplasm with a papillary/nested architecture,
as is typical for translocation RCC (Fig. 3).
The mechanism of efficacy of VEGF-targeted therapy in patients with Xp11.2 RCC is largely unknown.
Using microarray profiling, the gene expression profile of
Xp11.2 translocation RCC was found to be closer to that
of alveolar soft-part sarcoma (ASPS), a sarcoma that is
notoriously refractory to chemotherapy, than to clear cell
RCC.24 Although Xp11.2 translocation RCC likely arises
in renal tubular epithelial precursors such as clear cell
RCC, the underlying pathogenesis may be driven by the
ASPS-TFE3 gene fusion shared with ASPS. Recently, 4
patients with metastatic ASPS were treated with sunitinib,
with 2 patients demonstrating PRs and 1 patient achieving an ongoing response lasting >12 months.25 Upstream

target analysis on fresh frozen tissue demonstrated a high
level of activation of members belonging to the MET,
RET, and platelet-derived growth factor receptor family.
VEGF receptors were found to be activated in only 1 case.
In vitro, the ASPS-TFE3 fusion protein common to
ASPS and the Xp11.2 translocation carcinomas transactivates the MET promoter, increasing MET mRNA expression.26 Similarly, at the RNA level, ASPS has been shown
to overexpress the gene for the MET receptor tyrosine kinase compared with other translocation-associated sarcomas.27 Hence, MET is a potential therapeutic target in
these neoplasms. A selective inhibitor of c-Met receptor
tyrosine (ARQ-197) kinase has been shown to be safe
and well tolerated in a phase 1 trial. ARQ-197 is currently being evaluated in a phase 2 clinical trial
(NCT00557609) in patients with microphthalmia transcription factor-driven tumors, including translocationassociated RCC.28
In conclusion, adult-onset, translocation-associated
metastatic RCC is an aggressive disease that often presents
at an advanced stage and affects a younger population
with a female predominance. VEGF-targeted agents demonstrated efficacy in this small retrospective series of 15
patients that to our knowledge constitutes 1 of the largest
experiences in the treatment of this entity published to
date. Nevertheless, we recognize the potential bias inherent to retrospective studies that precludes a definitive
statement regarding whether VEGF-targeted agents
should be the preferred therapy for patients with advanced
stage Xp11.2 RCC. In addition, because of the heterogeneity of translocation RCC, even in adults, further genetic
and epigenetic studies are needed to prioritize the discovery of rational targets for the development of more effective therapies.
