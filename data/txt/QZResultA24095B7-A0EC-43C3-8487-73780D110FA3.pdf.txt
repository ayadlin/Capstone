BACKGROUND: Patient–reported outcomes have shown independent prognostic value for patients with nonsmall cell
lung cancer (NSCLC). However, translating patient-reported outcomes into useful prognostic information for individual patients has been problematic. METHODS: A total of 94 patients with advanced NSCLC and an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status (PS) of 0 to 2 who qualified for chemotherapy rated symptom severity
using the M. D. Anderson Symptom Inventory before and after their first chemotherapy cycle. Prognostic values of
baseline symptoms and changes in symptom severity were examined by Cox proportional hazards models. RESULTS:
In multivariate analysis, controlled for demographic and other factors, baseline coughing rated 4 independently predicted significantly higher risk for shorter survival (hazards ratio [HR], 8.69; P < .0001). Patients with coughing 4
and a PS of 2 were more likely to have shorter survival (HR, 20.6; P < .0001) than patients with coughing <4 and a
PS of 0 to 1. A 1–point or greater increase in severity of fatigue (P < .05), shortness of breath, or poor appetite (P <
.01) from baseline to the end of the first chemotherapy cycle was also found to be independently associated with
higher risk for poor survival. CONCLUSIONS: An increased risk for shorter survival was indicated by moderate to
severe coughing at baseline or by increased fatigue or shortness of breath during the first chemotherapy cycle in
patients with advanced NSCLC. Although cross–validation is needed, these data suggest that an individual patient’s
symptom severity scores, quickly obtainable in the clinic, might contribute clinically useful information for treatment

KEYWORDS: nonsmall cell lung cancer, symptom, The M. D. Anderson Symptom Inventory, patient–reported

Patients with advanced nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC) generally survive only 8 to 10 months after diagnosis, yet
during this relatively short time they suffer from significant symptom burden driven by rapid disease progression.1,2 High levels of physical symptoms (eg, pain, fatigue, pain, coughing) and affective symptoms (eg, distress and sadness) greatly affect
functioning and quality of life.3 For patients with advanced NSCLC, it is widely accepted that those with the poorest performance status (PS; Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group [ECOG> PS of 3-4)4 will have poor survival rates; those who have better PS (PS of 0-2) and who thus qualify for firstline chemotherapy will have improved but quite variable overall survival
rates. Knowledge of indicators for potentially shorter survival could help clinicians plan treatment and select candidates for
drug intervention clinical trials, and would provide evidencebased knowledge for better communication with patients.
Because of the limited survival associated with advanced NSCLC, patient ratings of symptom burden and quality of
life (patient–reported outcomes)3 are believed to be more clinically relevant than response to treatment, the typical

oncology clinical trial endpoint.5 Patient–reported outcomes have been shown to be reliable, easily measured
endpoints that provide independent prognostic information and crucial parameters for the treatment of patients
with lung cancer.3,6-14 Much of this research has suggested
that pretreatment symptom severity and changes in global
patient-reported outcome scores during chemotherapy
are predictors of survival.
The majority of the literature cited earlier reported
that pretreatment symptoms and/or changes in global
symptom scores during chemotherapy were predictors of
survival. Although these findings apply to groups of
patients, to the best of our knowledge there is only limited
information regarding how an individual patient’s symptom report might be used to predict that patient’s near–
term survival. For example, to our knowledge, no report
to date has described what specific type of baseline symptoms (if any) or which degree of measurable change in
symptom severity over time would be most critical for
establishing clinically useful criteria to predict overall survival. The lack of such quantitative information is a major
factor preventing the meaningful use of patient–reported
outcomes to guide patient management in routine
practice.5
We conducted a prospective longitudinal study to
quantitatively define the association between symptom severity ratings and survival outcomes in individual patients
with advanced NSCLC who qualified for chemotherapy.
The M. D. Anderson Symptom Inventory (MDASI),15 a
symptom assessment tool designed and validated for
administration to cancer patients, was used to evaluate
multiple symptoms. We hypothesized that moderate to
severe symptom levels at baseline and worsening symptom
burden during the first chemotherapy cycle would be independent predictors of overall survival in patients with
advanced NSCLC who were eligible for chemotherapy
(PS of 0-2).

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patient Sample
We recruited patients from the thoracic medical oncology
clinic at The University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer
Center. Eligible patients had stage IIIB or IV NSCLC;
were at least age 18 years; spoke English; had a PS of 0, 1,
or 2; and were scheduled for first–line chemotherapy.
Patients provided informed consent to participate in the
study. The M. D. Anderson Cancer Center Institutional
Review Board approved the study.

Assessment Methods
Symptom assessment

Patients completed the MDASI before and after the
first cycle of chemotherapy. The MDASI15 assesses the severity of 13 symptoms (pain, fatigue, nausea, vomiting,
dry mouth, shortness of breath, lack of appetite, difficulty
remembering, drowsiness, disturbed sleep, sadness, distress, and numbness) over the previous 24 hours on a 0–
to–10 numeric scale, in which 0 indicates ‘‘not present’’
and 10 indicates ‘‘as bad as you can imagine.’’ In addition,
we assessed 2 other symptom items common to patients
with NSCLC (coughing and constipation). In paper–
and–pencil format, the MDASI takes <5 minutes to
complete.
Other measures

Demographic information, clinician–estimated PS,
and previous and current cancer therapy were obtained
from medical records. Comorbidities were documented
using the Charlson comorbidity index score.16 Patient
survival was tracked through searches of M. D. Anderson
Cancer Center databases containing date–of–death information or, if necessary, searches of outside sources of
death information.
Statistical Analysis
On the basis of previous research on symptom severity
cutpoints17 and symptom management practice guidelines,18,19 we dichotomized baseline MDASI symptom
scores as ‘‘mild’’ (rated 0-3 on the MDASI 0-10 scale) or
‘‘moderate to severe’’ (rated 4 on the MDASI scale).
Changes in symptom scores between baseline and the end
of the first chemotherapy cycle were also dichotomized
according to whether the symptom increased 1 point on
the 0 to 10 scale (a symptom increase) or did not increase
(either no change or a decrease in symptom score). The
selection of 1 point as the indicator of symptom increase
from baseline to the end of 1 chemotherapy cycle was
based on the distribution of severity scores, in which 1
point represented an approximately 0.5 standard deviation of the sample, a value that has been suggested as a
clinically meaningful change.20,21
Univariate Cox proportional hazards models were
used to screen for correlations between candidate predictor variables (15 dichotomized baseline symptom variables and 15 dichotomized symptom-increase variables)
and overall survival. Component scores of mean symptom
severity were defined from symptoms that demonstrated a

significant correlation with overall survival in the univariate analysis (P < .05). These component scores were used
in the multivariate analyses.
Four multivariate Cox proportional hazards models
were fitted to examine the prognostic values of baseline
symptoms and symptom increase, adjusted for age, sex,
race, previous chemotherapy, comorbidities, and PS. The
baseline models used data from all patients who completed baseline symptom assessments and who contributed covariate data to examine the prognostic value of
both baseline component symptom scores (Model 1a)
and individual symptoms (Model 1b). The symptom–
increase models used data from only those patients who
reported symptoms by the end of the first chemotherapy
cycle and for whom covariate data were available to examine the prognostic value of both symptom-increase component scores (Model 2a) and individual symptoms
(Model 2b). For each of these models, final predictors
were selected by stepwise regression, with an entry level of
0.1 and a stay level of 0.05. Cox survival curves were plotted to model the correlation between survival time and either baseline symptom severity or symptom increase
during the first cycle. Model fitting for multivariate analysis was examined by Akaike information criterion.22

RESULTS
Table 1 presents demographic and disease–related characteristics for the patient sample. The median time span
between diagnosis of lung cancer and enrollment into the
study was 55 days. Of the 94 patients recruited, 41 (44%)
were newly diagnosed. During the course of the current
study, 86 (91%) patients received conventional platinum–based and/or paclitaxel–based chemotherapy, and 8
(9%) patients received single–agent chemotherapy (pemetrexed or gemcitabine). Poor PS (PS of 2) was noted in 6
of the 8 black or Hispanic patients (75%), compared with
22 of 86 (25%) white non–Hispanic patients.
Fifty-nine (63%) patients who completed baseline
assessments also contributed symptom data at Week 3,
the end of the first chemotherapy cycle. The remaining 35
(37%) patients provided only baseline data: 10 (11%)
patients did not undergo chemotherapy because of newly
found brain metastases, 1 (1%) patient died, 3 (3%)
patients withdrew from chemotherapy before completing
the first chemotherapy cycle because of disease progression, and 21 (22%) underwent chemotherapy but did not
contribute a symptom assessment at the end of the first
cycle. Of the 94 patients included in the current analysis,

between newly diagnosed patients and previously treated
patients, nor were there significant differences according
to race or sex.
Univariate analysis

Results of univariate Cox proportional hazards model
analysis suggested that overall survival was predicted by the
5 moderate to severe baseline symptoms: coughing (associated with the highest risk for death), nausea, lack of appetite, distress, and fatigue (Table 2). Among patient
characteristic covariates, race (hazards ratio [HR], 0.24; P
< .05) and a PS of 2 (HR, 2.17; P < .05) were found to be
significantly associated with overall survival.
Multivariate analyses

Multivariate Cox proportional hazards models
examined the prognostic value of the 5 baseline symptoms
that were found to have significant prognostic value in the
univariate analysis (n ¼ 91). Patient characteristic covariates (age, sex, race, previous chemotherapy, and level of
comorbidities) were adjusted in the model.
First, we fitted a component score of the 5 baseline
symptoms with significant prognostic value (Table 3,
Model 1a). Significant predictors of shorter survival were

140

a component score that included a patient’s report of at
least 1 moderate or severe symptom, a PS of 2, and being
a minority. Second, we examined all 5 individual symptom variables in the model (Table 3, Model 1b). After
stepwise variable selection, moderate to severe coughing
was found to be the only highly significant symptom predictor of survival (HR, 8.69; P < .0001). Patients who
rated their baseline coughing as moderate to severe had a
median survival time of 10.4 weeks, compared with 37.1
weeks for patients with no or mild baseline coughing (P <
.001). Of the patient characteristic covariates, a PS of 2
and being a minority were found to be independent predictors of shorter survival.
Because of potential confounding of race with PS (6
of 8 minority patients had a PS of 2), we refitted both of
the baseline models after excluding data collected from 10
minority patients (n ¼ 84). Both a baseline symptom
component score that included at least 1 moderate or
severe symptom (Table 3, Model 1a) and moderate to
severe coughing continued to be highly significant predictors of survival in the new models (Table 3, Model 1b).
Synergistic effects of baseline coughing and PS as
predictors of overall survival

To explore the synergistic effects of baseline coughing and PS on patient survival, we created a 4–level

Symptom Increase as a Predictor of
Overall Survival
The 59 patients who completed their first cycle of chemotherapy and contributed symptom data reported fatigue,
shortness of breath, and pain as the most severe symptoms
(Table 4). From baseline to the end of the first chemotherapy cycle, 3 symptoms (fatigue, disturbed sleep, and pain)
were found to have the highest prevalence of increase of
1 points on the MDASI 0-10 scale.

fatigue (P < .01), shortness of breath, vomiting, difficulty

decreased survival (Table 4).
Multivariate analyses

We examined the prognostic effect of symptom
increase in the 6 symptoms identified in the univariate anal-

Figure 1. Cox proportional hazards regression curves for survival duration are shown based on moderate to severe baseline
coughing (4 on the M. D. Anderson Symptom Inventory scale

ysis, both as a component score (Table 3, Model 2a) and as
individual symptoms (Table 3, Model 2b). Age, sex, race,
PS, previous chemotherapy, and level of comorbidities were
included as covariates in these analyses (n ¼ 56). First, we
found that a component score that included a symptom
increase in any 1 of the 6 symptoms significantly predicted
shorter survival (P ¼ .0017) (Table 3, Model 2a). Other significant predictors of survival in this model were the baseline
symptom severity component score (P ¼ .015) and poor
baseline PS (PS of 2) (P ¼ .032).
Second, a stepwise variable selection of candidate predictors was performed to determine which individual variables retained significance in the multivariate Cox model
(Table 3, Model 2b). We found that symptom increase in
fatigue (P ¼ .021) and shortness of breath (P ¼ .018) were
significant predictors of survival. Being white non–Hispanic
(P ¼ .009) also was found to be predictive of better survival.
Elimination of minority patients from the analysis (n ¼ 52)
had a noticeable effect in Model 2b: fatigue and lack of
appetite became significant predictors.
Model Fitting for Multivariate Analyses
We compared the Akaike information criterion22 for the
best model fit between models with a component symptom score (Models 1a and 2a) and models with single
symptom items (Models 1b and 2b). We found that the

single–symptom models fitted the data better than did the
models with component scores. For baseline models of
both the all–patient sample and the white non–Hispanic
patient sample, we consistently found that the model with
baseline coughing and PS (Model 1b) demonstrated the
smallest Akaike information criterion, which indicates the
best model fit (Table 5).

DISCUSSION
Although previous studies have shown that both
symptom ratings and responses to quality–of–life questionnaires are associated with survival, especially for
patients who have cancer with a shorter prognosis, to
our knowledge the current study is among the first to
examine whether measurement of baseline symptoms or
symptom change in an individual patient with advanced
cancer might assist in estimating the prognosis for that
patient.
Results of this study support our hypothesis that moderate to severe baseline symptoms and worsening symptom
burden during the first cycle of chemotherapy are strong independent predictors of overall survival in patients with
advanced NSCLC who were eligible to receive chemotherapy. Of the multiple symptoms rated by patients, moderate
to severe coughing (rated as 4 on the MDASI 11–point
scale) at baseline was found to have the most significant independent predictive value for poor survival in this patient
population, especially for patients with poor performance
status (PS of 2). In addition, we found that fatigue, shortness of breath, and poor appetite that had increased in severity by 1 points on the MDASI from baseline to the
end of the first chemotherapy cycle were independent predictors of poorer overall survival in these patients.

NSCLC to improve response to treatment and survival of
patients with NSCLC.23 Some molecular biomarkers are
promising as to their prognostic value for tumor response
and survival in patients with advanced NSCLC.23-25 Ultimately, however, the clinical application of these biomarkers may rely on the feasibility and ease of testing
them in clinical practice. In contrast, symptom assessment
via patient report can provide a simple, readily available,
yet robust prediction of the patient’s near–term survival,
especially when more elaborate tests are not available in
daily oncology practice. Further investigation into the
additional prognostic value of symptom measures along
with biomarkers for advanced NSCLC is merited.
Previous research regarding patient–reported outcomes has examined both health–related quality–of–life
and symptom information as predictors of survival. For
example, Eton et al6 reported that changes in quality–of–life
component scores over 2 cycles of chemotherapy were predictive of clinical outcomes in a group of patients with
advanced lung cancer. The results of the current study add
to these findings by suggesting that an individual patient’s
symptom scores (particularly when scores exceed specified
cutpoints) have utility in predicting outcomes, at least for
patients with advanced disease. Such cutpoints are often
used in the clinic to control symptoms. On the basis of
widely accepted symptom control guidelines,18,19 we provisionally set 4 on a 0 to 10 scale to describe a moderate to
severe symptom and its association with survival outcomes.
The potential utility of such a categorization on severity
scales has been well investigated for pain management in
individual patients,26 and it has been explored for categorizing the severity of other symptoms as well.17,27,28
The results of the current study support measuring a
few highly relevant symptoms as a simple, robust tool for
predicting outcomes in a busy clinic setting. Repeated
symptom ratings can be collected reasonably quickly:
patients typically complete the MDASI in 5 minutes. In
the current study, we took advantage of the multisymptom approach of the MDASI and its simple 0 to 10 rating
scale to compare a large number of symptoms. Fatigue,
shortness of breath, and pain were the most severe symptoms by the end of the first chemotherapy cycle (Table 4),
which is identical to findings from a retrospective study of
the prevalence and intensity of lung cancer symptoms
near the time of death.7 This study not only confirmed
the prognostic value of the component scores, but also
identified the specific symptoms that were most relevant
to overall survival status. In fact, the examination of
model fitting (Table 5) demonstrated the better

143

prognostic value of specific symptoms compared with
component scores. The current study results have added
evidence that a single–symptom score is responsive to
changes over time and is unambiguous as to which specific
symptom is changing, and to what degree.29
Investigating the interaction between symptom severity and baseline PS as a predictor of survival is justified
by the considerable percentage of patients (approximately
30%) with advanced NSCLC who had poor PS (PS of 2)
in this study. Although these patients typically are qualified for chemotherapy, they can expect only a small survival benefit.30 Even with a small sample size, the study
clearly demonstrated that the risk of death in patients with
moderate to severe coughing and a poor PS at baseline
was 20.6 times higher than for patients with only mild
coughing and a good PS (PS of 0-1) (P < .0001), a strong
indicator of which patients would be most likely to die
before the end of a chemotherapy clinical trial. This
model could potentially provide a practical tool for clinical use, because it may more precisely predict overall survival than either symptom severity alone or PS alone.
This study was limited in that it was conducted in a
single institution and with a mostly white non–Hispanic
patient sample; therefore, the impact of race or ethnicity on
survival is inconclusive. The multivariate analyses that
excluded the minority patients demonstrated a diluted
impact from PS on overall survival and demonstrated an
increased role for symptom report as an independent predictor. This result warrants further study in a sample containing sufficient minority patients to confirm the role of
race/ethnicity in patient-reported-outcome–predicted survival. In addition, although previous reports have indicated
that pain is an important prognostic factor in lung cancer, it
was not found to be a significant predictor of overall survival
in the current study.12 Improvements in the standard care
for pain management in oncology practice in many cancer
treatment centers in recent years may have diluted the
potential prognostic impact of pain in this study.
As with any other potential marker for survival or
progression, recommendations concerning patient care
cannot be made without repeated cross–validation studies
of the prognostic value of symptom–report models in
other cohorts of patients with advanced NSCLC who are
being treated in medical oncology clinics. Cross–validation in a much larger, multi–institutional study would
greatly enhance any recommendations regarding the use
of symptom reports as predictors of outcome. Nonetheless, the results obtained from this relatively small patient
sample were statistically significant, with at least 90%

power to detect an HR of 2.5 for baseline moderate to
severe symptoms at an a level of .05. This level of power
strongly supports the effect and clinical relevance of the
results and thus the use of symptom reports in predicting
outcomes in advanced NSCLC.
The stability of symptom reports based on a single
baseline time point needs to be established. Nevertheless,
the potential predictive power of symptom reports in individual patients, as found in the current study, is noteworthy and can easily be examined in other databases via the
methods we report herein. The increasing use of symptom
measures at baseline and longitudinally in observational
studies and clinical trials could provide data with which to
evaluate further the observations reported in the current
study. Symptom assessment by the MDASI takes <5
minutes, and the MDASI symptom data can be obtained
remotely via electronic (computer or telephone–computer) systems that cause little patient burden. The use of
symptom report as a predictor is also supported by the
evident clinical and biologic significance of increasing
symptom severity as a marker of disease severity.
In conclusion, the results of the current study highlight the importance of validated symptom–burden assessment tools, such as the MDASI, in gaining patient–report
information that, beyond facilitating better symptom
control in oncology care, is useful for predicting overall
survival in patients with advanced cancer. Such symptom–based prognostic information, taken together with
physician–rated PS, may help clinicians gain a sense of the
expected near–term survival for individual patients with
advanced NSCLC who qualify for chemotherapy.
