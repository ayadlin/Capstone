BACKGROUND: The objective of this study was to compare the incidence of hand-foot syndrome (HFS) in patients
who received pyridoxine versus placebo during pegylated liposomal doxorubicin (PLD) chemotherapy for recurrent
ovarian, breast, or endometrial cancer. METHODS: Patients received PLD 40 mg/m2 for a maximum of 6 cycles.
Patients were assigned randomly to receive pyridoxine 100 mg twice daily (Group A) or placebo (Group B) and
received standard HFS education. Patients completed the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy quality-of-life
(QOL) questionnaire. The incidence of HFS as measured by common toxicity criteria was compared between groups.
Analyses were conducted according to an intent-to-treat basis. Chi-square tests or Fisher exact tests were used.
RESULTS: Thirty-four patients were enrolled (18 in Group A and 16 in Group B), and 5 patients were unevaluable for
HFS assessment. Overall, 15 of 29 patients (52%) had HFS (all grades), and 10 of 29 patients (35%) had grade 2/3
events. Eight of 15 patients in Group A (53%) and 7 of 14 patients in Group B (50%) had HFS (P ¼ .857). For grade
2/3 events, there was no difference between groups: Six of 15 events (40%) occurred in Group A, and 4 of 14 events
(29%) occurred in Group B (P ¼ .70). There was no difference in QOL scores between patients who had grade 2/3
HFS and patients who had grade 0/1 HFS. QOL analysis revealed that all patients had elevated social well being.
CONCLUSIONS: Pyridoxine as administered in the current study did not prevent HFS in patients who received PLD. It
is possible that QOL is not compromised in patients with HFS because they may have increased social well being

quality of life.

The majority of patients with ovarian cancer present with advanced stage disease, and, unfortunately, many develop
recurrent disease. Pegylated liposomal doxorubicin (PLD) is a common chemotherapeutic used to treat recurrent ovarian
cancer.1,2 The efficacy of PLD in the treatment of other malignancies (eg, breast cancer and endometrial cancer) is evident.3-6 However, 1 of the most common side effects of treatment is palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia, also referred to as
hand-foot syndrome (HFS).
HFS occurs in 29% to 49% of patients who receive PLD treatment.7-11 HFS is characterized by paresthesias or tingling of the palms or soles with the potential to develop erythema and edema, and it is complicated by pain, blistering, and
cracking of the skin. If HFS occurs, it generally is observed after 2 or 3 cycles of treatment. The mechanism of HFS probably is related to keratinocytes and epidermal transit time. A subclinical inflammatory response at the time of redosing

may increase the permeability of skin blood vessels to liposomes.12 Management of HFS may include modification of dose or dosing intervals, cooling methods,
wearing loose-fitting clothes, and using topical agents
such as emollients, lotions, and moisturizing
creams.11,13,14 When extreme, HFS may necessitate cessation of therapy.
Small case series have questioned whether pyridoxine may prevent HFS.7,8,10 Pyridoxine (vitamin B6) is a
water-soluble vitamin that plays an important role in basic
and essential cellular functions. The mechanism of action
for the prevention or treatment of HFS with pyridoxine
remains unclear but reportedly may be related to antagonism of the P2X purinergic receptor, which accelerates
repair of the skin barrier and prevents epithelial hyperplasia.15 In addition, it is unknown whether HFS significantly affects a woman’s quality of life (QOL).
Healthcare outcomes research measures what is
done and what the intervention actually accomplishes. It
is uncertain how PLD effects patient outcomes like HFS
and QOL. Patient-related outcomes are tools completed
by patients to measure many aspects of the patient’s experience and may include assessment of QOL. QOL
changes throughout the course of a cancer patient’s journey through treatment, remission, recurrence, and at the
end of life. Research tools take patient’s subjective QOL
and attempt to measure it objectively by including physical, functional, social, and emotional domain assessments.16 During adjuvant chemotherapy, physical and
functional well being decline.17,18 However, it is unclear
how palliative chemotherapy affects a patient’s QOL and
which specific domains are altered.
The use of patient-related outcomes is changing
the way research is conducted and medicine is practiced.
These measures can be divided into 4 main groups: general surveys, disease-specific surveys, symptom-specific
surveys, and therapy-specific surveys. Ideally, a treatment-specific survey should be used, for example, the
Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Taxane
(FACT-Taxane).19 However, there is no such tool for
PLD or HFS. Until more treatment-specific tools are
developed, outcomes researches still must rely on the
National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), which are
used by nurses and physicians to grade the side effects of
cancer treatment.
The primary objective of the current study was to
compare the efficacy of pyridoxine versus placebo for the
prevention of HFS in patients with recurrent ovarian can-

4736

cer, metastatic breast cancer, or endometrial cancer who
received PLD (40 mg/m2 every 4 weeks). A secondary
objective was to compare the QOL of patients who experienced HFS with that of patients who did not experience
HFS during chemotherapy. Finally, in this analysis, we
sought to compare QOL domains in patients who had
recurrent ovarian cancer with the same domains in
patients who primarily received adjuvant chemotherapy
and in the normative US population of adult women.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
The study was designed as a double-blind, randomized,
controlled trial (Fig. 1). Randomization was stratified by
cancer diagnosis (ovarian, breast, or endometrial). All
patients were randomized to receive either oral pyridoxine
(vitamin B6) 100 mg twice daily or a comparable placebo.
The vitamin B6 dose was based on small case reports and
series that were available at the time of study initiation in
2004.7,8,10 Institutional review board approval was
obtained, and all patients signed informed consent before
participating in the study.
Patients were treated for recurrent ovarian cancer,
metastatic breast cancer, or advanced endometrial cancer
at a starting chemotherapy dose of 40 mg/m2 every 4
weeks. Eligibility criteria (related to PLD treatment)
included a Karnofsky performance status 60% and
adequate bone marrow, renal, and liver function. Patients
were required to have a baseline multigated acquisition
scan or a 2-day echocardiogram within normal limits.
Ineligible patients included those who had received previous PLD therapy, pregnant or lactating women, and
women with a history of hypersensitivity reactions attributed to a conventional formulation of doxorubicin HCL
or the components of PLD. Patients with a history of cardiac disease or clinical evidence of congestive heart failure
were ineligible.
Patients were required to have discontinued corticosteroid therapy at least 3 weeks before enrollment, and no
corticosteroids were allowed for the duration of the trial.
Patients who currently were receiving any pyridoxine
therapy except for that included in a multivitamin must
have discontinued pyridoxine therapy at least 3 weeks
before enrollment. Patients who had experienced previous
HFS were not specifically excluded from the study.
PLD (Centocor Ortho Biotech Inc., Horsham, Pa)
therapy was initiated at 40 mg/m2 intravenously every 4
weeks over 1 hour. Pyridoxine was supplied as 100-mg
tablets, and placebo tablets that were indistinguishable

matching placebo were given orally the first morning
before the PLD infusion and twice daily thereafter. All
nursing education was standardized by using a PLD education checklist and literature provided by Centocor
Ortho Biotech Inc. Patients were instructed to bring in
their medication containers and pill calendar at each visit
to check for compliance.
Patients were monitored weekly with telephone calls
from the research nurse and monthly at clinic visits for
overall (including pyridoxine) and specific PLD-related
toxicities using version 3.0 of the NCI CTCAE.20 Adverse
events like HFS, hematologic toxicities, and stomatitis were
managed by dose modification or dose delays and adjustments. Any patient whose chemotherapy treatment was
delayed was evaluated on a weekly basis until adequate he-

delays >2 weeks occurred, then patients were taken off
study. Patients were instructed to continue taking pyridoxine/placebo every day despite delays in treatment. HFS was
managed by lengthening the dosing interval and dose
reduction as noted (Table 1). The treating physician was
informed only with regard to which regimen the patient
was assigned if there was a serious adverse reaction or if the
patient experienced grade 2 or 3 HFS. Patients with grade
2 or 3 HFS were unblinded; and, if the patient was taking
placebo, then they were given pyridoxine starting on Day 1
of the next planned therapy. If the patient was taking pyridoxine, then they were removed from the trial and managed at the discretion of the treating physician.
QOL was measured with the FACT-G questionnaire after the third course of PLD before the patient was

seen by the treating physician and before chemotherapy
was administered. The questionnaire was read to the
patient by the research nurse in the case of illiterate
patients; otherwise, it was completed by the patient herself. The FACT-G version 4 is a 27-item core questionnaire that evaluates the domains of physical, functional,
family-social, and emotional well being.16 Questions are
answered on a 5-point Likert scale (0 ¼ not at all, 1 ¼ a
little bit, 2 ¼ somewhat, 3 ¼ quite a bit, and 4 ¼ very
much), and a subscale was computed when 50% of the
items had been answered. Women with ovarian cancer
completed the FACT-Ovarian (FACT-O), an additional
12 questions specific to ovarian cancer. Reliability, validity, and sensitivity to change of the FACT-G have been
demonstrated in a variety of settings, and relative scores
can be compared with normative data.21 Basen-Engquist

4738

et al demonstrated reliability and validity of the FACT-O
instrument in ovarian cancer patients with internal consistency reliability for the subscales ranging from 0.74 to
0.92 and with test-retest reliability between 0.72 and
0.88.22
It is estimated that the incidence of HFS for all toxicity grades is 49%.7-11,23 A decrease 50% in the incidence of HFS in patients receiving pyridoxine would be of
clinical significance. A sample size of 27 patients per
group was chosen, because this would allow us to detect a
difference between an HFS incidence of 49% and 11.5%
(a ¼ .05; 2-sided power ¼ 0.80). An interim analysis was
conducted after 30 patients were enrolled and had evaluable HFS assessment data. Because of decreased accrual
and similar HFS rates between groups, the trial was closed
for enrollment after the interim analysis was completed.
Data were analyzed according to the treatment
group assigned (intent-to-treat) even if patients were noncompliant and stopped taking the assigned intervention.
Demographic and treatment history variables (primary
cancer treatment, stage of disease, number of previous
chemotherapy cycles) were described and compared by
using t tests, chi-square tests, or Fisher exact tests between
groups. The relative risk (RR) with appropriate 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were used to describe the incidence
of HFS between groups. Comparisons also were made
between patients who experienced grade 2/3 HFS versus
grade 0/1 HFS. QOL data during chemotherapy are
described and compared between patients who had grade
0/1 HFS and grade 2/3 HFS. In addition, an exploratory
analysis was done comparing QOL data from our cohort
of women with recurrent ovarian cancer, QOL data from
women with newly diagnosed ovarian cancer on Gynecologic Oncology Group (GOG) protocols 152 and 172
who were receiving intravenous paclitaxel and cisplatin
chemotherapy, and QOL data obtained from the normative US population of adult women.18,24,25 The breakdown of domains in those who received intraperitoneal
chemotherapy on the GOG 172 trial is not available.

RESULTS
Thirty-four patients were enrolled, including 18 women
who were randomized to Group A (pyridoxine) and 16
women randomized to Group B (placebo). The mean
patient age (standard deviation) was 64  9.6 years
(range, 45-81 years), and 56% of women were aged 65
years (Table 2). The majority of patients (85%) were Caucasian. Twenty-five patients (73.5%) were treated for

recurrent ovarian/peritoneal cancer, 8 patients (23.5%)
were treated for endometrial cancer, and 1 patient was
treated for breast cancer; all patients received single-agent
PLD therapy. The majority of patients (56%) had
received 1 prior chemotherapy regimen, and 44% had
received 2 prior regimens. No patients in this study
had prior HFS. Socioeconomic and performance status
were similar between groups. The mean number of PLD
chemotherapy cycles administered was 3.5 (range, 1-6
cycles) and did not differ between groups. Mean compliance for taking the assigned intervention (pyridoxine vs
placebo) was 92% versus 97%, respectively. The number
of chemotherapy cycles administered and compliance did
not differ between groups.
Five patients (3 in Group A and 2 in Group B) were
not evaluable for HFS assessment (because of reactions to
chemotherapy during the first course of chemotherapy).
Overall, 52% of patients developed HFS (all grades),
including grade 2 or 3 events in 35% (Table 3). No grade
4 events were observed. In Group A, 8 of 15 patients

Group A, pyridoxine (n ¼ 15); Group B, placebo (n ¼ 14).

PLD dose reductions occurred in 2 patients in Group A,
including 1 patient who had grade 4 anemia requiring
transfusion and 1 patient because of grade 3 stomatitis. In
patients who received placebo (Group B), PLD treatment
was delayed in 3 patients for grade 2 deep vein thrombosis, grade 3 increased alkaline phosphatase, grade 3 hematologic parameters, and grade 3 HFS. Five patients who
were receiving pyridoxine and 5 patients who were receiving placebo had disease progression and died during PLD
therapy.
There were no differences in global or domain QOL
scores after Cycle 3 either between groups or between the
patients with grade 2/3 HFS versus grade 0/1 HFS (Table
5). Overall, functional (score, 18.7) and emotional (score,
18.7) domains were the most compromised during therapy. There was a decline in the physical domain for those
with grade 2/3 HFS; however, it was not statistically significant. Less than half of patients (4 of 10 patients; 40%)
with grade 2/3 HFS reported being bothered by side
effects of treatment, as indicated by scores 2 (somewhat

or higher) on the FACT-G physical domain question
regarding treatment side effects.
An exploratory line-item analysis was performed on
the physical and functional QOL domains to strategize
for future intervention trials. With regard to physical difficulties, nausea (14%) was the most common followed
equally by pain (7%) and trouble meeting the needs of
family (7%). In the functional domain, sleep disruption
(7%), enjoyment (7%), and being content (7%) all were
compromised equally.
Global QOL scores were higher for patients enrolled
on palliative PLD chemotherapy (global QOL score,
84.6) than for patients enrolled on the GOG 152 and
GOG 172 studies who received adjuvant intraperitoneal
chemotherapy71 and patients who received adjuvant intravenous chemotherapy (global QOL score, 80.9). It is
noteworthy that global scores for patients enrolled on palliative PLD were higher than scores for the normative
population (global QOL score, 79.6). However, their
social domain scores were markedly higher compared
with scores from the US population of adult women
(Table 6).

DISCUSSION
The objective of palliative chemotherapy in the setting of
recurrent cancer is to improve the quantity of life and
QOL for patients. It is imperative to measure patientrelated outcomes, such as side effects of therapy, to appropriately evaluate treatment regimens when efficacy results
are similar among various chemotherapeutic options.
Fifty-two percent of patient’s in the current prospective
study had HFS, and 35% had grade 2/3 events. There was
no difference in the incidence of HFS between patients
who received prophylactic pyridoxine and patients who

grade 2/3 HFS reported being bothered by side effects of
PLD treatment, which speaks to the resilience of this
patient population. Patients who were receiving pyridoxine or placebo had a similar occurrence of overall adverse
events and dose reductions, and pyridoxine did not appear
to compromise the efficacy of PLD therapy.
HFS and other forms of rashes are potential side
effects in several chemotherapy and biologic therapeutics.
The incidence of HFS with PLD that we observed in the
current study was high normal compared with the incidence reported in the literature.7-11,23 Steroids were an
exclusion criteria in this study, which may be a factor in
our HFS incidence. Some clinicians give pretreatment steroids to prevent chemotherapy anaphylaxis, and this may
suppress some treatment-induced drug rashes. Regional
cooling methods using ice packs at the wrists and ankles
and the consumption of iced liquids during PLD infusion
and for 24 hours after chemotherapy also have been suggested as means for reducing the frequency and severity of
HFS and are well tolerated.13,14 However, others consider
cooling mechanisms an actual risk factor for HFS.26
The mechanism of action of HFS with certain
chemotherapy and biologic therapeutics is unclear. With
regard to PLD, histologic patterns include HFS and morbilliform eruptions with atypical squamous proliferations
that exhibit epidermal dysmaturation.27 Others postulate
that the exact clinical presentation may depend on preexisting skin diseases.28 The patterns of cutaneous adverse
effects of biologics, such as sorafenib, may be mixed. In
addition, biologic HFS reactions may be clinically distinct
from the well known chemotherapy-induced HFSs.29
Although pyridoxine was not preventative at 100 mg
twice daily, it may be beneficial at higher doses or with
other biologic or chemotherapeutic drugs.30 Azad et al used

combination therapy with sorafenib and bevacizumab in a
phase 1 study.31 The incidence of HFS in that study was
76%, and the investigators used pyridoxine in doses up to
400 mg administered twice daily. They subsequently noted
increases in HFS with the cumulative use of these agents
using maximum doses of pyridoxine of 800 mg daily.
Other chemotherapeutic agents that are used to treat ovarian cancer may induce a drug rash, including gemcitabine
and capecitabine.32 In addition, there appears to be a
higher incidence of cutaneous adverse events with other
biologic agents that are used to treat ovarian cancer. These
include cetuximab, lenalidomide, and tanomastat.33-35
The HFS rash appeared to be tolerable in most
patients, because it did not disrupt patient-rated QOL.
However, it is unclear whether the tools used in the current study were adequate to capture the specific problem
of rash, because the line item in the physical well being domain relates to overall side effects of treatment and does
not specifically address HFS. CTCAE are used by nurses
and physicians to grade the side effects of cancer treatment, whereas patient-related outcomes tools like QOL
questionnaires are completed by patients. Therefore,
CTCAE are not a validated patient-related outcomes;
and, in the current study, there was no correlation. The
NCI classifies HFS according to 3 grades, whereas the
World Health Organization (WHO) uses 4 grades; however, it is doubtful that the WHO definition would have
changed the correlation, because the side effect
remained.36 Because of the increased prevalence of treatment-induced, cutaneous side effects with the increased
use of chemotherapeutic and biologic agents, it is imperative to develop patient-related outcomes simultaneously
with the drugs.
The course of QOL during palliative chemotherapy
has not been well defined. When comparing global QOL

4741

Original Article

scores, patients on palliative chemotherapy for ovarian
cancer in the current study had higher scores than those
published in the normal population.25 However, on further analysis, the higher scores were caused by markedly
higher social domain scores among patients with ovarian
cancer as also reported among patients with ovarian cancer who had newly diagnosed disease.37 Most important,
when comparing global QOL scores for patients on palliative chemotherapy with the scores for patients on adjuvant
intravenous and intraperitoneal therapy, the scores were
compromised most for patients who were receiving intraperitoneal therapy.
There are concerns to be taken into consideration
when interpreting findings from a relatively small number
of evaluable patients. A limitation of the current study was
a lack of racial heterogeneity, which may reduce the generalizability of the results. Another limitation was the inability to assess and compare all adverse events because of the
low power of the study. With regard to preventing HFS
with pyridoxine, it may still have some efficacy at higher
doses. Clinicians may consider adding intravenous steroids irrespective of any other supportive care measure
before infusion with PLD to prevent HFS; or, it is possible that pyridoxine will not be effective. However, it may
be effective in certain symptoms, such as tingling, and not
in others, such as pain. Developing better tools to measure
the intricacies of drug rashes will assist in measuring
patient outcomes.
With regard to measuring QOL, assessments were
missing for those patients who did not complete at least 3
cycles of chemotherapy because they were taken off study
for disease progression. The exploratory QOL analysis of
patients with recurrent ovarian cancer on palliative chemotherapy was limited by the number of patients; however,
more randomized phase 3 clinical trials for recurrent ovarian cancer are being performed and are including QOL
and symptom indices. Therefore, as the literature grows,
more comparisons will be made to plan interventions to
improve QOL in this compromised patient population.
Pyridoxine as administered in this study did not prevent HFS in patients who were receiving PLD. Many
patients with ovarian cancer are treated with numerous
chemotherapeutics agents over the course of their disease.
It is anticipated that these patients will receive more biologic therapeutics over time. In addition, it is expected
that there will be more pairings of chemotherapy with
biologic agents. It is unclear whether the mechanisms of
action of HFS from different agents are related enough to
warrant similar prevention and treatment. Therefore, it will

4742

be imperative to continue exploring cutaneous adverse
events in these agents along with prevention strategies.
