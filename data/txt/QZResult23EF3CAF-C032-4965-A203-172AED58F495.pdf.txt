ABSTRACT
Due to early onset of local invasion and distant metastasis, pancreatic cancer
is the most lethal human malignant tumor, with a 5 year survival rate of less than
5%. As a effective chemotherapy drug for pancreatic cancer patients, gemcitabine
is reported to inhibit cell proliferation as a nucleotide analog. In this study, we
investigated the role of gemcitabine in immune regulation of pancreatic cancer. Our
data showed that the level of soluble ULBP2 (sULBP2), a ligand of NKG2D receptor,
decreased in the supernatants of pancreatic cancer cell lines when gemcitabine was
added, and sULBP2 level correlated with NK92 cells cytotoxicity to pancreatic cancer
cell lines. Importantly, our data showed that gemcitabine promoted PANC-1 cells and
MIA PaCa-2 immune evasion by reducing ADAM10 expression, a metalloproteinase
involved in sULBP2 shedding from cell membrane. Knockdown of ADAM10 clearly
downregulated sULBP2 levels in the culture supernatants and cells became more
susceptible to NK92 cytotoxicity. Serum samples and tumor samples were obtained
from 45 patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). Statistical analysis
showed a significant correlation between the serum level of sULBP2 with ADAM10
expression in PDAC tissues. In conclusion, our data demostrated that gemcitabine
inhibits ULBP2 ectodomain shedding through the suppression of ADAM10 and
enhance NK cells cytotoxicity by NKG2D-ULBP2 interaction. The results extends
our understanding of gemcitabine in the treatment of pancreatic cancer from cell
proliferation inhibition to immune regulation.

Gemcitabine is the only chemotherapy drug that
has been demonstrated to show benefit in patients with
pancreatic cancer [6]. Gemcitabine alone or in combination
with other chemotherapy drug or radiation treatment may
prolong survival of pancreatic cancer patients. It is reported
to show an broad-spectrum anti-tumor effect for most solid
tumors by destroying cell replication as a nucleotide analog
[7]. However, little is reported about its regulation on cancer
immunity. Gemcitabine may increase memory T cells and
induce naïve T cell activation, and may enhance antitumor
immunity induced by tumor vaccine [8, 9]. To expand the
application of gemcitabine in treatment of pancreatic cancer,
its immunological impact needs to be evaluated.

INTRODUCTION
Pancreatic cancer has become the forth leading
cause of cancer-related death worldwide, and is one of the
most common malignant tumors [1, 2]. Radical surgery
remains the only option to cure pancreatic cancer, but
few patients are diagnosed when surgical resection is
feasible [3]. That is why the prognosis is poor, with similar
mortality and incidence [4]. The average survival period
after prognosis is no more than six months, whereas the
overall 5-year survival rate is less than 5%[5]. Therefore,
it is urgent to develop novel therapeutic approaches to
treat pancreatic cancer.

ULBP2, one of UL16-binding protein family, is a
cell surface glycoprotein and functions as a stress-induced
ligand for NKG2D receptor [10]. Various NKG2D ligands
are shown to be upregulated by a range of primary tumors,
including lung, kidney, prostate, breast and colon cancers
[11-14]. Immune response induced by ULBP2-NKG2D
may play an important role in the eradiation of tumors by
T and/or NK cells.
In the present study, we investigated the correlation
between the sULBP2 expression and gemcitabine, and
found gemcitabine inhibit sULBP2 shedding from cell
surface of pancreatic cancer cell lines, which protect
pancreatic cancer from NK cells cytotoxicity. Furtherly,
ADAM10 knockdown experiments demonstrated the
essential roles of ADAM10 protease in the shedding of
ULBP2. Gemcitabine showed anti-cancer effect by downregulating NK cells function via inhibition of ADAM10
expression and shedding of sULBP2, which broadens our
previous understanding of gemcitabine in the treatment of
pancreatic cancer.

Treatment with gemcitabine was observed to have
markedly augmented membrane-bound ULBP2 expression
and significantly decreased sULBP2 in PANC-1 cells and
MIA PACA-2 cells.

Gemcitabine enhances NK cells cytotoxicity to
PANC-1 and MIA PACA-2 cells via ULBP2
As a ligand of nature immune activating receptor
NKG2D, ULBP2-NKG2D interaction may promote
tumors immune evasion. We cultured NK92 cell lines
and evaluated the cytotoxicity of NK92 cells to PANC1 or MIA PACA-2 cells using the CCK-8 assay. We cocultured NK92 cells and PANC-1 or MIA PACA-2 cells,
with or without gemcitabine. Treatment with gemcitabine
was shown to enhance NK cytotoxicity to PANC-1 and
MIA PACA-2 cells, whereas sULBP2 protein decreased
NK cytotocity to PANC-1 cells or MIA PACA-2 cells
remarkably (Figure 2a, 2b). The results demonstrated
gemcitabine may have effect on NK cells function to
pancreatic cancer cells via NKG2D-ULBP2 pathway.

RESULTS

Gemcitabine inhibits ULBP2 shedding via
suppressing ADAM10 expression

Gemcitabine inhibits shedding of ULBP2 in
PANC-1 and MIA PACA-2 cells

ADAM10 (a disintegrin and metalloproteinase 10)
is reported to be responsible for the shedding of NKG2D
ligands from the surface of various cell types via the
proteolytic cleavage and release of the ectodomains of
NKG2D ligands. To verify whether gemcitabine inhibits
ULBP2 shedding through the suppression of ADAM10,
we cultured PANC-1 cells and MIA PACA-2 cells with or
without gemcitabine. Realtime PCR and western blot results
showed that gemcitabine treatment downregulate ADAM10
expression in PANC-1 cells and MIA PACA-2 cells (Figure
3a). Then PANC-1 cells or MIA PACA-2 cells were
transfected with siRNA against human ADAM10 or control
siRNA. The downregulation of ADAM10 transcripts and

We cultured 2 pancreatic cancer cell lines,
PANC-1 and MIA PACA-2 cells and analyzed culture
supernatants from the two cell lines. The level of sULBP2
decreased after gemcitabine was added to the culture
medium of PANC-1 and MIA PACA-2 cells (Figure 1a).
Gemcitabine was found to inhibit shedding of ULBP2
at concentrations of ≤ 2 μmol/L. Based on this finding,
gemcitabine with concentrations of 2 μmol/l was used to
in the next experiments. FACS analysis showed ULBP2
was expressed on the cell surface on PANC-1 and MIA
PACA-2 cells in the membrane form, and gemcitabine
upregulated ULBP2 surface expression (Figure 1b).

ADAM10 protein was monitored by real-time RT-PCR and
by western blotting, respectively (Figure 3b). No difference
was noted in proliferation between the control and
ADAM10 knockdown cells (data not shown). Knockdown
of ADAM10 for PANC-1 cells and MIA PACA-1 cells
resulted in 40.95% and 42.7% reduction of sULBP2 levels
in the culture medium, respectively (Figure 3c). Taken
together, these results suggest that gemcitabine inhibits
ULBP2 shedding in PANC-1 cells and MIA PACA-1 cells
by downregulating the expression of ADAM10.

was observed in the serum ULBP2 levels with regard
to the CA199 levels (p=0.013),lymph node metastasis
(p=0.009) and overall survival(p=0.045)(Figure 5). There
was no significant correlation between the ADAM10
expression with age, gender, tumor size, perineural
invasion, or lymph node metastasis (P>0.05, respectively).
Serum ULBP2 was found to be positively correlate with
ADAM10 expression. The results indirectly confirmed
that the effect of gemcitabine on pancreatic cancer may be
related to ADAM10 and ULBP2.

sULBP2 level is correlated with poor prognosis
and ADAM10 expression

DISCUSSION
Gemcitabine is the standard chemotherapy regimen
for the treatment of advanced pancreatic cancer [15]. It is
a nucleoside analogue, which exerts its anti-tumor effect
through a variety of mechanisms, mainly via inhibition of
DNA replication and mask of DNA chain termination [16].
Therefore, it prevents the DNA synthesis and DNA repair,
causes the cell to enter apoptotic pathway. However, its
role in immune response have not be fully documented.
Our results demonstrated that gemcitabine inhibit ULBP2
ectodomain shedding through down-regulation of
ADAM10 expression in PANC-1 and MIA PACA-2 cell
lines. Decrease of sULBP2 and increase of membranebound ULBP2 thus promote NK cells activation and may
improve the antitumor effect against pancreatic cancer,
which will be further confirmed by studies on tissues of
pancreatic cancer patients.

We next investigated serum levels of ULBP2 by
ELISA assay in 45 PDAC patients (Supplementary Table
S1) and 45 healthy individuals, and the sULBP2 levels
of PDAC patients were significantly higher (p<0.001)
than in healthy controls (data not shown). Based on ROC
analysis of PDAC patients and healthy controls, the cutoff value of 16.11 pg/ml was used to divide the serum
sample into groups that were negative or positive for
sULBP2 (Supplementary Figure S1). The expression of
ADAM10 was determined using immunohistochemical
analysis, which showed that ADAM10 staining was
mainly located in the cytoplasm of tumor cells with
varying staining intensity (Figure 4). The clinical and
pathological characteristics of the pancreatic cancer
patients are presented in Table 1. A significant difference

In the present study, the level of serum ULBP2 was
examined in 45 PDAC patients using ELISA. sULBP2
was found to be over-expressed in sera of pancreatic
cancer patient compared with healthy individuals.
Moreover, a significant difference was noted in the serum
ULBP2 level with regard to the CA199 levels and lymph
node metastasis. Serum levels of ULBP2 in pancreatic
cancer patients were also found to correlate significantly
with shorter overall survival and poor prognosis. ULBP2
shedding is thought to be a principal mechanism by which

tumor cells escape from NKG2D-mediated immune
surveillance in pancreatic cancer. Therefore, ULBP2
is hypothesized to be associated with the malignant
transformation of pancreatic cancer.
ADAM10 is one of the the ADAM family of
disintegrin proteinasesm, and mediates proteolytic
release of ectodomains of transmembrane proteins
from the cell surface, including cytokines, growth
factors and cell adhesion molecules [17, 18]. The
present study demonstrated that ADAM10 expression

is significantly lower in gemcitabine treated pancreatic
cell lines. Meanwhile, serum levels of ULBP2 was
positively correlated with ADAM10 expression shown by
immunohistochemistry, suggesting that gemcitabine may
exerts its anti-tumor effect through inhibition of ADAM10
mediated ULBP2 shedding and corresponding enhanced
NKG2D-mediated tumor elimination.
In this study, the siRNA mediated ADAM10
knockdown was found to decrease the release of sULBP2,
which proved the essential role for the cleavage of sULBP2.
The observations suggest that ADAM10 may serve as
a potential therapeutic target for treatment of pancreatic
cancer patients who are not sensitive to gemcitabine.
In conclusion, gemcitabine has been demonstrated
not only to inhibit cell proliferation, but also to enhance the
immune response of pancreatic cancer cells by enhancing
the activity of NK cells. The present study sheds light on
previously unrecognized effects of gemcitabine on tumor
immune response, modulating ADAM10 and ULBP2
shedding, thus suggesting its use in chemoimmunotherapy
against human pancreatic cancer.

were surgically treated in the Affiliated Provincial Hospital
of Anhui Medical University(Hefei, China). The samples of
cancer tissue were obtained during surgery, and then fixed
in 10% formalin solution and embedded in paraffin. The
diagnosis of the samples was confirmed histopathologically.
Informed consent was obtained from each patient, and
the study protocol was approved by the Research Ethics
Committee of Anhui Provincial Hospital. Follow-up data
were collected from all 45 patients, and the mean followup period in the present investigation was 9.8 (range 4–26)
months. Overall survival (OS) time was calculated from the
date of surgery to the date of death or last observation.

Cell lines
The PANC-1, MIA PaCa-2 pancreatic cancer cell
lines and NK92 cell lines were obtained from Shanghai
cell bank (Shanghai, China). PANC-1 cells were
maintained in DMEM (GIBCO) with 10% heat inactivated
fetal bovine serum(FBS), 50 units/mL penicillin, and 50
units/mL streptomycin. MIA PaCa-2 cells were cultured in
DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS, 2.5% horse serum,
1% sodium pyruvate 100 mM solution (Invitrogen), 50
units/mL penicillin, and 50 units/mL streptomycin. NK92
cells were maintained in α-MEM (GIBCO) with 10% FBS,
100 U/mL recombinant human IL-2 (rhIL-2; PeproTech),
50 units/mL penicillin, and 50 units/mL streptomycin. All
cells were cultured in humidified air with 5% CO2 at 37°C.

were: ADAM10, 5′-AACCCAGCTGTCACCCTCGAA-3′;
negative control, 5′-TTCGAGGGTGACAGCTGGGTT-3′.

Total RNA samples was extracted by using Trizol
according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Quantitative
PCR was performed using SYBR Premix Ex Taq
(Takara). The primer sequences used were as follows:
ADAM10 forward, 5’- TTGGGAAGATGGTAGCTTGG
-3’; reverse, 5’- CACATATTCCTCCAGAGCTTCC-3’;
GAPDH mRNA served as internal control.
cDNA was amplified (40 cycles, 95°C for 10 sec,
60°C for 30 sec, 72 for30 sec) with an ABI StepOnePlus
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. A melting
curve analysis was performed to monitor PCR-product
purity, and relative gene expression data were analyzed
using the 2-ΔΔ Ct method.

Flow cytometric analysis
For the detection of membrane-bound ULBP2,
cells were incubated with phycoerythrin (PE)-mouse
anti ULBP2 antibody (FAB1298P, R&D systems) and
then subjected to flow cytometry. Flow cytometry was
performed using a FACSCalibur, and data were analyzed
using WinMDI2.9 software.

CCK-8 assay
The CCK-8 (cell counting kit-8) assay was used to
determine the cytotoxicity of NK92 cells. PANC-1 or MIA
PACA-2 cells were used as target cells. Target cells were
seeded in 96-well plates, with 1*104 cells in each well,
with or without gemcitabine. NK92 cells were incubated
with target cells at effector/target ratios of 1:1, 1:5, 1:10 or
1:25 for 4 hr. A 20 μL aliquot of enhanced CCK8 solution
(5 mg/ml in PBS) was then added to each well. Following
1 hr of incubation, absorbance was measured on an ELISA
reader at a test wavelength of 450 nm. The percentage of
cytolysis was calculated as [1-(Effect with Target cells)/
Target]×100.

Western blot
PANC-1 cells and MIA PACA-2 cells were lysed
with lysis buffer (Beyotime Institute of Biotechnology,
China), and protein concentration was subsequently
estimated by the bicinchoninic acid protein assay. Then,
equal amounts of protein samples were separated on 10%
sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis
gels and transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride
membranes (Millipore, USA). After being blocked with
5% nonfat milk, membranes were incubated overnight
at 4 °C with rabbit primary antibodies against human
ADAM10 (Boster, China) and human actin (Zhongshan
Golden Bridge Biotechnology, China). After being
washed with Tris-buffered saline/0.1% Tween three times,
membranes were incubated with secondary antibodies for
1 hours at room temperature. Immunoreactive bands were
visualized using the enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL;
Pierce,USA) kit. The specific protein bands were captured
and visualized using FUSION FX5 (Vilber Lourmat).

Immunohistochemistry
Serial tissue sections (4 μ m thick) were
deparaffinized with xylene, rehydrated, and subjected to
microwave antigen retrieval in citrate buffer (pH 6.0)
for 20 minutes. Endogenous peroxidase activity was
quenched by 3% hydrogen peroxide for 10 minutes.
Afterward, the sections were incubated at 4° C overnight
with monoclonal antibody (anti-ADAM10; Abcam)
in a humidified chamber. After being washed, the
sections were incubated for 30 minutes with horseradish
peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (Zhongshan
Golden Bridge Biotechnology). Immunoreactivity was
visualized with chromogen 3,3’diaminobenzidine.
Finally, all slides were counterstained with ematoxylin,
dehydrated, and mounted. Tumor expression of
ADAM10 was semiquantitatively evaluated using a
previously reported method, and the percentage of
staining cell scores (0, no staining; 1, 10%; 2, 10%–
30%; 3, >30%) and the staining intensity scores (0,
negative; 1, weak; 2, moderate; 3, strong) were summed.
The final scores were ranged as following: total score <
3 was defined as negative (-), 3-6 as“+”, 6-9 as“++’’,
and 9-12 as “+++’’. All sections were assessed by two
pathologists who were blinded to clinical data.

ELISA assay
Blood samples were procured from the pancreatic
cancer patients with informed consent according to the
institutional guidelines. Serum samples were centrifuged
at 1500 g for 10 min and the sera were stored at -80 °C
until usage. Supernatants of the cell lines were harvested at
72hr. For the determination of ULBP2 levels, commercial
DuoSet ELISA kits (R&D Systems) was used, and assays
were performed following the manufacturer’s instructions.
The data were analyzed with Origin 8.0 software.

siRNA-mediated knockdown
The small interfering RNA (siRNA) method was
used to knockdown ADAM10. Chemically synthesized
ADAM10 siRNA and negative control siRNA were
purchased from Genechem (Shanghai, China).
Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) was used for transfection
following the manufacture’s instructions. The siRNAs used
