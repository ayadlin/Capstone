Abstract
NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Metastatic progression depends on genetic alterations intrinsic to cancer cells as well as the
inflammatory microenvironment of advanced tumors1,2. To understand how cancer cells affect the
inflammatory microenvironment, we conducted a biochemical screen for macrophage activating
factors secreted by metastatic carcinomas. Amongst the cell lines screened, Lewis lung carcinoma
(LLC)3 were the most potent macrophage activators leading to production of IL-6 and TNF-α through
activation of the Toll-like receptor family members4 TLR2 and TLR6. Both TNF-α and TLR2 were
found to be required for LLC metastasis. Biochemical purification of LLC conditional medium
(LCM) led to identification of the extracellular matrix proteoglycan versican, which is upregulated
in many human tumors including lung cancer5,6, as a macrophage activator that acts via TLR2 and
its co-receptors TLR6 and CD14. By activating TLR2:TLR6 complexes and inducing TNF-α
secretion by myeloid cells, versican strongly enhances LLC metastatic growth. These results explain
how advanced cancer cells usurp components of the host innate immune system, including bone
marrow-derived myeloid progenitors7, to generate an inflammatory microenvironment hospitable
for metastatic growth.

Distant site metastases are the leading cause of cancer-associated mortality and depend on
genetic and/or epigenetic alterations that are intrinsic to cancer cells or extrinsic factors
provided by the tumor microenvironment1. For instance, cytokines produced by inflammatory
cells can enhance metastatogenesis by repressing the metastasis suppressor maspin within
primary prostate carcinoma cells8. Furthermore, tumor progression and metastasis positively
correlate with presence of infiltrates containing myeloid and lymphoid cells2,9. It was shown
that certain carcinomas secrete factors that upregulate fibronectin and recruit vascular
endothelial growth factor receptor 1 (VEGFR1)-positive hematopoetic progenitors to sites of

future metastatic growth, termed the pre-metastatic niche7. To examine whether cancer cells
secrete factors that directly activate myeloid cells to produce tumor promoting cytokines10, we
collected serum free conditioned medium (CM) from different cancer cell lines, derived mainly
from C57BL6 mice, and applied it to bone marrow (BM)-derived macrophages (BMDM),
which were assayed for production of IL-1β, IL-6 and TNF-α. The screen included 1C1C7 and
TrampC1, which are liver and prostate cancer cell lines, respectively, with little or no metastatic
activity, and two metastatic breast and lung carcinomas, 4T1 and LLC, respectively. CM from
metastatic cells, especially LLC, induced higher amounts of IL-6 and TNF-α secretion than
CM from non-metastatic cells (Fig. 1A). IL-1β secretion was undetectable and the CM did not
contain IL-6 or TNF-α (data not shown). LLC-CM (LCM) also induced expression of Il1β,
Il6 and Tnfα mRNAs, whereas serum free medium (SFM) and NIH3T3 CM were inactive (Fig.
1B and data not shown). We investigated the metastatogenic function of some of the LCMinduced cytokines by tail vein injection of LLC into age- and sex-matched Tnfα and Il6
knockout mice and wild-type (WT) controls. Tnfα−/− mice exhibited markedly (p<0.001)
reduced mortality relative to WT mice after inoculation with 1×106 LLC cells (Fig. 1C) and
showed an even greater survival advantage when given a smaller LLC inoculum (Suppl. Fig.
1A). Similar differences were seen in lung tumor multiplicity (Fig. 1D). By contrast, there was
little difference in survival of Il6−/− and WT mice inoculated with 1×106 LLC cells (Suppl.
Fig. 1B). Thus, TNF-α but not IL-6 is important for LLC metastasis.

We explored the involvement of TLR family members in sensing LCM components. BMDM
from mice deficient in TLR2, TLR3, TLR4 or TLR9 or their adaptor proteins, Myd88 and
TRIF (which is inactivated by the Lps2 mutation: Trifm)4, were examined for production of
IL-6, a convenient BMDM activation marker. LCM-induced IL-6 was fully dependent on
TLR2 and Myd88 but not on TLR3, TLR4, TLR9 or TRIF (Fig. 2A). Tlr2−/− BMDM were
also defective in LCM-induced Il1β and Il6 mRNA expression and LCM did not induce antitumorigenic type I interferon (IFN) genes (Suppl. Fig. 2A), which are readily induced upon
TLR3 or TLR4 engagement11. TLR2 was also required for LCM-induced of IL-6 and TNFα secretion by alveolar macrophages, which produced 10-fold more TNF-α than BMDMs
(Suppl. Fig. 2B). TLR2 was required for optimal LCM-induced activation of mitogen-activated
protein kinases (MAPK) and IκB kinase (IKK) or IκBα degradation (Fig. 2B). TLR2 uses
TLR1, TLR6 or CD14 as co-receptors12. LCM-induced IL-6 production was dependent on
TLR2, TLR6 and CD14 but not on TLR1 (Fig. 2C). By contrast, the response to Pam3CSK4,
a bacterial lipoprotein analog4, depended on TLR2 and TLR1 but not on TLR6 and CD14.
These results rule out possible contamination with bacterial lipoproteins. Furthermore, antimycoplasma treatment of LLC had no effect on LCM activity (data not shown).

To examine the in vivo role of TLR2, we inoculated sex- and age-matched Tlr2−/− and WT
mice with 2×105 LLC cells via the tail vein and measured mRNAs encoding cytokines and
chemokines in their lungs. LLC-induced lung inflammation was previously described13, but
its mechanism was unknown. Tnfα, Il1β, Il6 and inflammatory chemokine mRNAs were
induced 5 days after LLC inoculation in WT lungs, peaking at 9 days post-inoculation (Fig.
2D). None of these mRNAs was induced in lungs of Tlr2−/− mice, whose basal content of
Mip1β/Ccl4, Mip2/Cxcl2 and Kc/Cxcl1 mRNAs was higher than WT lungs (Suppl. Fig. 3). In
addition, Tlr2−/− and WT mice were subcutaneously (SC) inoculated with LLC cells and
examined for lung macrophage infiltration and inflammatory cytokine gene expression 15 days
later. Although no difference was observed in primary SC tumor growth, macrophage
infiltration and inflammatory cytokine gene expression were greatly reduced in Tlr2−/− relative
to WT mice (Suppl. Fig. 4A–C).
To investigate whether TLR2 signaling contributes to LLC metastatogenesis, we inoculated
age-and sex-matched Tlr2−/− and WT mice with dsRed-labeled LLC cells via the tail vein and
examined their lungs for micrometastases. WT but not Tlr2−/− lungs showed small clusters of

DsRed-LLC cells with adjacent CD11b+ and CD11c+ myeloid cells (Fig. 3A). We also detected
a few CD3+ cells (T cells) in micro-metastases of WT lungs (data not shown). Importantly,
Tlr2−/− mice exhibited significantly greater (p<0.02) survival than WT mice after LLC
inoculation and their lungs contained fewer and smaller tumor nodules (Fig. 3B, C). Tumor
nodules in WT mice contained more CD11b+/Gr1+ inflammatory monocytes/myeloid
suppressors and IL-10high/F4/80+ M2 macrophages (Suppl. Fig. 5). Tlr2−/− mice exhibited
significantly fewer lung and liver tumor nodules than WT mice and lower incidence of adrenal
gland metastasis after SC implantation of LLC cells (Fig. 3D). To investigate whether TLR2
is acting in BM-derived cells, we examined survival of LLC-inoculated chimeric mice. Mice
reconstituted with Tlr2−/− BM (WT/Tlr2−/−) exhibited markedly improved (p<0.04) survival
relative to mice reconstituted with WT BM (WT/WT) (Fig. 3E). WT/WT and WT/Tlr2−/− mice
were also inoculated with 2×105 LLC cells followed by intraperitoneal injections of LCM or
SFM. Lung and liver tumor loads were significantly higher (p<0.05) in WT/WT mice receiving
LCM vs. those receiving SFM along with the LLC inoculum (Fig. 3F). The pro-metastatic
effect of LCM was dependent on TLR2 activation, as little or no metastatic enhancement was
seen in WT/Tlr2−/− mice. These results strongly suggest that LCM contains TLR2-activating
factors that enhance metastatogenesis.

To identify the nature of these factors, we collected large amounts of LCM and separated it on
a mono-Q anion exchange column and monitored column fractions for their ability to induce
IL-6 in BMDM. Fractions with IL-6 inducing activity were pooled and separated on a Superdex
200 sizing column (Suppl. Fig. 6). Most of the IL-6 inducing activity eluted in a few high
molecular weight (HMW) (>400 kDa) fractions that contained several polypeptides larger than
200 kDa. These fractions were pooled, deglycosylated and subjected to mass spectrometry
(MS), resulting in identification of several peptides derived from the extracellular matrix
(ECM) proteins: versican v1, laminin β1, thrombospondin 2 and procollagen type III α1 (Fig.
4A). To examine which protein accounts for induction of inflammatory cytokines, we
incubated LCM with individual neutralizing antibodies prior to BMDM stimulation and
measurement of cytokine production. Incubation of LCM with antibodies to versican, laminin
β1 or procollagen type III α1, but not thrombospondin 2, reduced IL-6 and TNF-α production
(Suppl. Fig. 7). A control antibody to HMGB1, an inflammatory mediator released by necrotic
cells14, did not inhibit cytokine induction.

To investigate the role of these proteins in LCM-enhanced metastatogenesis, we generated
stable LLC cell lines containing shRNAs specific to versican v1 (Vers), laminin β1 (Lb) or
procollagen III α1 (Proco). Silencing efficiency was approximately 90 % or higher (Fig. 4B).
The silenced cells and LLC cells transduced with a control shRNA were injected into mice and
lung tumor nodules and survival were monitored. Silencing of versican v1 significantly reduced
(p<0.001) tumor multiplicity, but silencing of laminin β1 resulted in only a modest inhibition
whereas procollagen III α1 silencing slightly enhanced tumor multiplicity (Fig. 4C).
Furthermore, silencing of versican v1 reduced lung nodule multiplicity by 4-fold (Suppl. Fig.
8A). Tumors isolated from mice inoculated with versican-silenced LLC cells displayed very
low versican expression (Suppl. Fig. 8B), whereas lung tumors from LLC-inoculated mice
expressed much versican than normal lung (Suppl. Fig. 8C). Importantly, mice inoculated with
versican-silenced LLC cells exhibited significantly improved (p<0.05) survival (Fig. 4C).
Silencing of versican also reduced metastatic spread to lung, liver and adrenal glands in the
SC implantation model (Fig. 4D). To ascertain the proinflammatory and premetastatic
functions of versican, we used the low metastasic LLC variant, P29-LLC15. CM from P29LLC did not induce IL-6 in BMDM and contained very little versican (Suppl. Fig. 9). Ectopic
expression of human versican in P29-LLC cells increased lung tumor multiplicity after tail
vein injection (Fig. 4E).

To examine how versican activates macrophages, we produced His-tagged human (h) versican
v1 in LLC cells and purified it on a Ni-chelate column. The purified protein induced IL-6 and
TNF-α production in WT but not Tlr2−/− BMDM (Fig. 4F). We investigated whether versican
interacts with TLR2 or its CD14 co-receptor. Immunoprecipitation of lysates of LCMincubated Raw264.7 macrophages with versican-specific antibody, but not a control antibody,
co-precipitated TLR2 and CD14 but not TLR4 (Fig. 4G). The versican antibody did not
precipitate TLR2 unless the macrophages were first incubated with LCM.

Metastasis is the result of a complex process involving invasion of adjacent tissues,
intravasation, circulatory transport, arrest at a distant site, extravasation, growth, survival and
neoangiogenesis16. BM-derived cells, such as macrophages2 and hematopoietic progenitors7,
are important participants in this process but how they are mobilized and activated to support
metastasis is unclear. Our results indicate that versican secretion by LLC cells is necessary for
metastatic spread to lung, liver and adrenal gland, a process that depends on TLR2-mediated
myeloid cell activation and TNF-α production. Versican is an aggregating chondroitin sulfate
proteoglycan that accumulates both in tumor stroma and cancer cells5,6. Versican can bind
hyaluronan (HA) and both versican and HA are highly expressed in non-small cell lung cancer
(NSCLC), especially in advanced disease with high recurrence rate, while versican in normal
lung is rather low6. Versican or fragments thereof enhance tumor cell migration, growth and
angiogenesis, processes that are of direct relevance to metastasis17. Versican also binds to
several adhesion molecules expressed by inflammatory cells and has pro-inflammatory
activity18. A related ECM proteoglycan, biglycan, was reported to activate both TLR2 and
TLR419, but our results indicate that the pro-inflammatory activities of versican rely on TLR2
but not TLR4. TLR2 recognizes Gram positive bacteria-derived lipoteichoic acid and
lipoproteins4. This activity mainly depends on TLR2:TLR1 dimers20, but the response to
versican requires TLR6 and not TLR1 as a co-receptor. Although TLR2 and versican interact,
it is not clear whether this interaction is direct or depends on a versican ligand, such as HA.
Indeed, HA fragments can activate macrophages through TLR221 and HA accumulation and
the enzyme that converts large HA polymers to smaller fragments, hyaluronidase, have been
linked to metastasis22.

TLR2 on host myeloid cells and their product TNF-α are important positive modulators of LLC
metastatic behavior but neither protein influences primary tumor growth of SC-implanted LLC.
It appears that TNF-α is one of the major pro-metastatic factors produced by host myeloid cells.
TNF-α can suppress the apoptosis of cancer cells and stimulate their proliferation through NFκB activation23. In addition, by increasing vascular permeability24, TNF-α can enhance
recruitment of leukocytes as well as intravasation and extravasation of cancer cells. We suggest
that versican, its interaction with TLR2 and production of TNF-α by activated myeloid cells,
provide potential points for anti-metastatic intervention.

Methods Summary
A detailed Methods section is available in the Supplementary Information that accompanies
this manuscript. Briefly, LLC cells were injected via the tail vein or SC implanted into 6–7
week old mice at 2×105 to 2×106 cells/mouse to measure metastases to lung, liver or adrenal
gland. Metastasis enhancing factors were purified from LLC conditioned medium by column
chromatography and identified on a QSTAR XL qQTOF mass spectrometer. Factor activity
was determined by the ability to induce IL-6 production by BMDM. Gene and protein
expression were monitored by Q-PCR and immunoblot analysis, respectively. Tumors and
their composition were analyzed by immunohistochemistry and indirect immunofluorescence.
