BACKGROUND: In patients with previously untreated metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC), we conducted a phase 1b/randomized
phase 2 trial to define the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of mFOLFOX6 plus bevacizumab (mFOLFOX6/bev) with conatumumab, an
investigational, fully human monoclonal IgG1 antibody that specifically activates death receptor 5 (DR5). METHODS: Twelve patients
were enrolled in a phase 1b open-label dose-escalation trial of conatumumab with mFOLFOX6/bev; thereafter, 190 patients were
randomized 1:1:1 to receive mFOLFOX6/bev in combination with 2 mg/kg conatumumab, 10 mg/kg conatumumab, or placebo. Therapy cycles were repeated every 2 weeks until disease progression or the occurrence of unacceptable toxicity. RESULTS: In phase 1b,
conatumumab with mFOLFOX6/bev was tolerated without apparent added toxicity over mFOLFOX6/bev alone. In phase 2, conatumumab with mFOLFOX6/bev did not confer a benefit in progression-free survival when compared with placebo with mFOLFOX6/
bev. Toxicity was similar in all treatment arms. Following treatment, similar increases in circulating caspase-3 levels were observed in
all arms. CONCLUSIONS: Conatumumab with mFOLFOX6/bev did not offer improved efficacy over the same chemotherapy with placebo in first-line treatment of patients with mCRC. These data do not support further development of conatumumab in advanced

INTRODUCTION
Despite introduction of several new systemic therapies for treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC), the 5-year
survival rate remains only 12%.1-3 New therapies are needed to address this unmet patient need.
Selective activation of extrinsic apoptosis pathways in cancer cells represents a potential therapeutic target for systemic treatment of advanced malignancies.4 Tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis inducing ligand (TRAIL) is a member of the tumor necrosis factor superfamily. TRAIL can induce apoptosis by binding to death receptor 4 (DR4) or death
receptor 5 (DR5) and activating downstream caspases, which ultimately leads to p53-independent cell death.4
Conatumumab is an investigational, fully human monoclonal IgG1 antibody that specifically binds DR5.5 In preclinical studies, conatumumab induced apoptosis in a variety of cancer cell lines with little toxicity to normal cells and
inhibited growth and potentiated the effects of irinotecan and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) in CRC xenografts.5
In humans, DR5 is expressed in most CRCs.6 In the first-in-human phase 1 trial of single-agent conatumumab, 1
patient with mCRC achieved a metabolic partial response, and 4 patients with mCRC had stable disease for >12 weeks.7
Together, the preclinical and clinical evidence suggests that conatumumab combined with chemotherapy may be effective
in patients with mCRC. We therefore conducted a phase 1b trial to define the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) for

conatumumab and mFOLFOX6 plus bevacizumab
(mFOLFOX6/bev) in patients with previously untreated
mCRC followed by a randomized, placebo-controlled
phase 2 trial of mFOLFOX6/bev 6 conatumumab to
assess treatment efficacy, safety, and tolerability. Exploratory pharmacodynamic and patient stratification biomarkers were also assessed.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patient Population

The patient population included patients 18 years with
histologically or cytologically confirmed metastatic adenocarcinoma of the colon or rectum; measurable disease
(per RECIST v1.0); Eastern Cooperative Oncology
Group (ECOG) performance score of 0 or 1; and
adequate hematological, renal, and hepatic function. Key
exclusion criteria included history or known presence of
central nervous system metastases or other malignancies;
prior chemotherapy or other systemic therapy for metastatic disease; radiotherapy to >25% of bone marrow; or
receipt of an investigational agent for treatment of CRC.
Adjuvant chemotherapy was allowed if disease progression
was documented 12 months after completion of adjuvant chemotherapy. The study was approved by local
institutional review boards at each site, and written
informed consent was obtained from all patients.
Study Objectives

The primary phase 1 end point was the incidence of
adverse events (AEs) and clinical laboratory abnormalities
defined as dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs). The primary
phase 2 end point was the estimation of progression-free
survival (PFS). Secondary end points included overall survival (OS), objective response rate, incidence of AEs and
clinical laboratory abnormalities, incidence of conatumumab antibody formation, relative dose intensity, and
conatumumab pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters. Exploratory end points included biomarker analysis of caspase
activation and polymorphisms in the low-affinity immunoglobulin gamma Fc region receptor III-A (FCGR3A).
Study Design and Treatment

Phase 1b was an open-label dose-escalation study conducted at 6 sites to determine the safety, tolerability, and
MTD of conatumumab and mFOLFOX6/bev. Two
doses of intravenous conatumumab (3 and 10 mg/kg)
were evaluated in sequential dose levels on a once-every-2weeks (Q2W) schedule. On day 1 of each treatment cycle,
patients received a 2-hour infusion of 85 mg/m2 oxaliplatin with 200 mg/m2 leucovorin l-form or 400 mg/m2

racemic, then an intravenous bolus of 400 mg/m2 5-FU,
then 5 mg/kg bevacizumab over 30 minutes, then conatumumab over 30 minutes, and then a 46- to 48-hour continuous infusion of 2400 mg/m2 5-FU. Treatment cycles
were repeated until disease progression or the occurrence
of unacceptable toxicity.
In phase 2, 2 and 10 mg/kg conatumumab was
investigated because PK modeling predicted that Q2W 2
mg/kg conatumumab was expected to provide continuous
exposure above the EC50 values observed in preclinical
xenograft models,5 antitumor activity was seen in the
first-in-human study with a dose as low as 0.3 mg/kg,7
and a wider range of exposures provided better assessment
of exposure-response relationships.
Phase 2 was a randomized, double-blind, placebocontrolled study conducted at 48 sites to evaluate the
safety and efficacy of conatumumab and mFOLFOX6/
bev for first-line treatment of mCRC. One hundred and
ninety patients were randomized 1:1:1 to receive mFOLFOX6/bev in combination with 2 mg/kg conatumumab,
10 mg/kg conatumumab, or placebo intravenously on a
Q2W schedule. Drugs were administered as in phase 1,
except administration of bevacizumab before mFOLFOX6 was allowed at the investigator’s discretion.
Patients were stratified by ECOG performance score (0 or
1) and serum lactate dehydogenase ( institutional upper
limit of normal [ULN] vs >ULN) at the time of randomization. Patient disposition is shown in Figure 1.
Sample Size Selection

Phase 2 was designed to estimate the treatment effect
(assessed by PFS) of adding conatumumab to mFOLFOX6/bev, rather than to test formal inferences. Assuming a median PFS of 9 months in the placebo arm,
approximately 180 patients were needed to have 33%
power to detect a 3-month improvement in PFS at a 5%
level of significance when combining the 2 active arms.
Data Analysis

Analyses were conducted separately for phase 1b and
phase 2. Summary statistics are provided for safety, efficacy, PK, antibody, and exploratory data. For continuous
variables, mean and standard deviation were calculated.
For categorical variables, frequency and percentage in
each category were displayed.
The first patient was dosed on October 3, 2007. The
primary analysis was performed when 120 patients had
documented investigator-assessed disease progression or
death (May 4, 2010). The final analysis was conducted

when the study ended (September 1, 2011). At that time,
152 patients had documented, investigator-assessed disease progression or death, and 102 patients had died. PFS
from the primary and final analyses was very similar.
Thus, only results from the final analysis are presented.

Tumor response was assessed by the investigator per
RECIST v1.0. Imaging to evaluate tumor response was
performed every 8 weeks (67 days). The proportion of
patients achieving an objective response was calculated,
and the presence of a dose response was tested using a
Cochran-Armitage trend test.

Safety

Safety end points were DLTs and AE incidence. A DLT
was defined as any grade 3 hematologic or nonhematologic toxicity related to conatumumab or to the combination of conatumumab and mFOLFOX6/bev. Exceptions
included alopecia, lymphocytopenia, and anemia. AE severity was determined using the National Cancer Institute
Common Toxicity Criteria for AEs v3.0.
Efficacy

Time-to-event end points were summarized using the
Kaplan-Meier method among patients enrolled in the
phase 2 study. PFS was calculated as the number of days
from randomization to the first assessment of disease progression (per RECIST v1.0 or clinical progression) or
death due to any cause. Stratified Cox regression models
were used for analysis of PFS and OS, with patients analyzed as randomized. Stratified log-rank tests and Tarone
trend tests were used to determine the strength of any
conatumumab dose response.

Conatumumab antibodies

Serum samples for anticonatumumab antibody assessments were collected before administration on day 1 of
cycles 1 and 5 and every 12 cycles thereafter and at the
end-of-study visit.
Pharmacokinetics

Blood samples were collected at all phase 1 and selected
phase 2 sites to measure serum levels of conatumumab,
bevacizumab, oxaliplatin, and 5-FU. Conatumumab serum concentrations were measured before infusions on
day 1 of cycles 1, 2, 3, and 5 and every 8 cycles thereafter;
within 5 minutes before the end of the conatumumab
infusion on cycles 1, 3, and 5 and every 8 dosing cycles
thereafter; 48 (64) hours after the start of the conatumumab infusion on cycles 1 and 3; and at the end-of-study
visit. Bevacizumab, oxaliplatin, and 5-FU concentrations
were measured before each infusion and within 5 minutes
before the end of the infusion during cycles 1 and 3.

As previously described,8 serum concentrations of
conatumumab and bevacizumab were measured using a
validated enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and
plasma 5-FU and oxaliplatin concentrations were estimated by validated liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry assays. PK parameters were summarized using
WinNonlin Enterprise software, version 5.1.1 (Pharsight
Corp., Mountain View, CA).
Biomarkers

At all phase 1 sites and select phase 2 sites, blood samples
were collected before mFOLFOX6/bev infusions on day
1 and 48 (64) hours after the start of the mFOLFOX6/
bev infusions on day 3 of cycles 1 and 3. DNA from
blood samples was used for FCGR3A F158V singlenucleotide polymorphism genotyping by allelic discrimination assay. FV and VV genotypes were combined for
PFS and OS analyses because of the low number of
patients with the VV polymorphism and overall small
sample size.9 Active caspase 3/7, caspase-cleaved cytokeratins, and circulating DNA fragments were assayed as
previously described.10
RESULTS
Patients

In phase 1b, 16 patients were screened, 6 patients received
3 mg/kg conatumumab with mFOLFOX6/bev, and 6
patients received 10 mg/kg conatumumab with mFOLFOX6/bev. Patient demographics and baseline disease
characteristics are summarized in Table 1.
Cancer

December 15, 2013

In phase 2, 236 patients were screened; 190 patients
were randomized 1:1:1 to 2 mg/kg conatumumab/
mFOLFOX6/bev (n 5 64), 10 mg/kg conatumumab/
mFOLFOX6/bev (n 5 62), or placebo/mFOLFOX6/bev
(n 5 64). Baseline patient demographics and disease characteristics were generally well balanced across treatment
arms with slightly more women in the conatumumab
arms than in the placebo arm (Table 2). Disease progression (44%, 58%, and 47%), partial withdrawal of consent
(11%, 11%, and 9%), and AEs (16%, 10%, and 6%)
were major reasons for discontinuation of treatment in
the 2 mg/kg conatumumab, 10 mg/kg conatumumab,
and placebo arms, respectively.
Safety
Phase 1b adverse events

Grade 3 or 4 treatment-emergent AEs were seen in 5
patients (83%) in the 3 mg/kg conatumumab arm and in
6 patients (100%) in the 10 mg/kg conatumumab arm.
Common grades 3 and 4 treatment-emergent AEs are
listed in Table 3. No patients experienced grade 5 AEs.
No patients in the 3 mg/kg conatumumab arm experienced a DLT. Two patients in the 10 mg/kg conatumumab arm experienced grade 4 pulmonary embolisms,
which were not thought to be related to study medication.
Thus, the MTD was not reached.
Phase 2 adverse events

Grade 3 or greater treatment-emergent AEs were seen in
81% of patients in the 2 mg/kg conatumumab arm

(P 5 .80 by stratified log-rank test). Kaplan-Meier estimates of PFS are shown in Figure 2.
Overall survival

OS was not significantly different among the conatumumab and placebo arms. Median OS (95% CI) was 22.6
months (17.5, not estimable [NE] months) in the 2 mg/
kg conatumumab arm, 29.0 months (18.6, NE months)
in the 10 mg/kg conatumumab arm, and 23.8 months
(17.7, NE months) in the placebo arm. Compared with
placebo, the stratified HR (95% CI) was 0.93 (0.58-1.49)
in the 2 mg/kg conatumumab arm (P 5 .80 by stratified
log-rank test) and 0.80 (0.49-1.31) in the 10 mg/kg conatumumab arm (P 5 .30 by stratified log-rank test).
Kaplan-Meier estimates of OS are shown in Figure 3.
Objective response

Of 190 patients randomized in phase 2, 185 (97%) had
measurable disease at baseline. Objective response was
similar across treatment arms; 30 (49%), 32 (52%), and
31 (50%) patients had an objective response in the 2 mg/
kg conatumumab, 10 mg/kg conatumumab, and placebo
arms, respectively.
Relative Dose Intensity

Four patients (2%) had a grade 5 treatment-emergent adverse event.

In phase 2, mean relative dose intensity (calculated as the
ratio of actual cumulative dose to protocol-specified cumulative dose over the specified period) for conatumumab was similar between the 2 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg

85% vs 86%), oxaliplatin (83% vs 84% vs 87%), and bevacizumab (88% vs 89% vs 91%) were also similar among
the 2 mg/kg conatumumab arm, the 10 mg/kg conatumumab arm, and the placebo arm, respectively.
Pharmacokinetics

Conatumumab exposure increased approximately dose
proportionally after infusions of 2, 3, or 10 mg/kg
4296

conatumumab plus mFOLFOX6/bev. Following 2 cycles
of treatment with 10 mg/kg conatumumab, the
mean serum trough and maximum observed concentrations were 61.7 and 249 mg/mL, respectively. Conatumumab did not have a significant effect on bevacizumab or
oxaliplatin PK.

We examined whether FCGR3A F158V polymorphisms,
which result in high- and low-affinity forms of FCGR3A,
could influence outcome in patients who received conatumumab.11,12 Of 156 patients genotyped for the FCGR3A
F158V polymorphisms, 72 patients had the FF genotype,
64 patients had the FV genotype, and 20 patients had the
VV genotype. Relatively equal numbers of patients with

patients, no significant differences in PFS or OS were
observed among patients treated with conatumumab versus placebo, although improvement in PFS approached
significance (Table 5).
Changes in serum levels of several cell death biomarkers, including caspase 3/7, gDNA, caspase-cleaved cytokeratin-18, and total soluble cytokeratin-18, were

DISCUSSION
In this multicenter, phase 1b/randomized phase 2 trial,
the addition of conatumumab to standard first-line chemotherapy for mCRC (mFOLFOX6/bev) did not confer a
PFS benefit compared with mFOLFOX6/bev alone. In
other recent phase 2 trials, conatumumab also did not significantly improve PFS in combination with panitumumab13 or FOLFIRI in patients with mCRC.14 The
reasons for the lack of effect are unclear, as preclinical
studies have shown that conatumumab can inhibit colorectal tumor growth and potentiate the effects of 5-FU in
preclinical xenograft models.5 In preclinical studies, conatumumab could also potentiate the effect of irinotecan.5
Further research could be considered to determine the efficacy of conatumumab in combination with other
regimens.
Conatumumab with mFOLFOX6/bev had a manageable toxicity profile, and treatment-emergent AEs were
similar among arms. A greater incidence of grade 3 hypoCancer

December 15, 2013

kalemia was seen in patients receiving either 2 mg/kg
conatumumab (5%) or 10 mg/kg conatumumab
(15%) relative to placebo (0%). The mechanism
underlying hypokalemia is unknown. As there was no difference in gastrointestinal toxicity among arms, the higher
rate of hypokalemia may indicate renal potassium wasting, but this would have to be confirmed by dedicated
studies.
Several factors may have contributed to the lack of
efficacy in this study. Preclinical studies have shown that
conatumumab must be cross-linked to induce apoptosis.5,11,12,15 However, it is unknown whether conatumumab becomes cross-linked in human cancer patients. A
polymorphism in the FCGR3A gene leads to high- and
low-affinity forms of FCGR3A, with the VV genotype
having higher affinity for IgG1 than the FF genotype. Previous studies have suggested that patients with higheraffinity forms of FCGR3A may have an improved
response to conatumumab.16,17 In this study, a trend toward improved PFS with conatumumab treatment was
observed among patients with high-affinity forms of
FCGR3A, although this did not reach statistical significance. In contrast to the apparent interaction for PFS,
FCGR3A genotype did not modify the effect of conatumumab on OS, and no clear OS benefit for conatumumab was observed for any genotype.
In addition, conatumumab induces apoptosis
through activation of downstream caspases. In this study,
levels of activated caspase-3 were elevated relative to baseline in both the 2 and 10 mg/kg conatumumab arms, consistent with the results of the first-in-human trial.7
However, a similar increase over baseline was also seen in
the placebo arm, indicating that conatumumab did not
induce additional caspase activation over mFOLFOX/bev
alone.
Together, these data suggest that weak activation of
the TRAIL receptor may contribute to the lack of efficacy
seen in this study. Stronger activation may be seen in
patients with the VV polymorphism in the FCGR3A
gene, contributing to the trend toward improved PFS
observed in these patients. In addition, other components
of the extrinsic apoptotic pathway, such as cFLIP and caspase 8, can negatively impact TRAIL-induced apoptosis18
and may also have impacted this trial. These factors may
act as predictive biomarkers for response to conatumumab
and other TRAIL receptor ligands.
Multiple TRAIL receptor agonists are currently in
clinical trials for non-small cell lung cancer, lymphoma,
soft-tissue carcinoma, CRC, pancreatic cancer, ovarian
cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma, multiple myeloma, and

other advanced tumors. These agents have generally been
well tolerated, but the efficacy results available so far have
been disappointing.7,8,13,14,19-29 Similarly, we have shown
that conatumumab with mFOLFOX6/bev did not demonstrate improved efficacy over placebo in first-line treatment of patients with mCRC. Overall, the data do not
support further development of conatumumab in
advanced CRC. Identification of biomarkers and greater
understanding of the extrinsic apoptosis pathway in cancer treatment may help to guide the development of therapies that target this pathway.
