ABSTRACT
Introduction: Recent studies indicated tumors may be comprised of
heterogeneous molecular subtypes and incongruent molecular portraits may emerge
if different areas of the tumor are sampled. This study explored the impact of intratumoral heterogeneity in terms of activation/phosphorylation of FDA approved drug
targets and downstream kinase substrates.
Material and methods: Two independent sets of liver metastases from colorectal
cancer were used to evaluate protein kinase-driven signaling networks within different
areas using laser capture microdissection and reverse phase protein array.
Results: Unsupervised hierarchical clustering analysis indicated that the signaling
architecture and activation of the MAPK and AKT-mTOR pathways were consistently
maintained within different regions of the same biopsy. Intra-patient variability of the
MAPK and AKT-mTOR pathway were <1.06 fold change, while inter-patients variability
reached fold change values of 5.01.
Conclusions: Protein pathway activation mapping of enriched tumor cells obtained
from different regions of the same tumor indicated consistency and robustness
independent of the region sampled. This suggests a dominant protein pathway
network may be activated in a high percentage of the tumor cell population. Given
the genomic intra-tumoral variability, our data suggest that protein/phosphoprotein
signaling measurements should be integrated with genomic analysis for precision
medicine based analysis.

molecular characteristics of the tumor [1-9]. Nearly all
precision medicine clinical studies utilize core needle
biopsies or fine needle aspirates as the preferred tissue
collection method due to their relatively non/low-invasive
nature compared to surgical excision. However, recent
studies have indicated that tumors are characterized
by significant inter- and intra-tumoral molecular
heterogeneity. As a consequence, a different molecular
architecture may emerge when different areas of the tumor
are sampled or when primary tumors are compared to
matched metastatic lesions [10-21]. Therefore, if tumors
are indeed heterogeneous at the genomic clonal level, is a
single biopsy sufficient to determine the most appropriate
course of treatment for any given patient?
Because genomic instability is a characteristic
of cancer cells, whether the heterogeneity observed is
largely based on variability of “passenger” alterations
(not causally significant for the tumorigenic process nor
under selective pressure) and whether these alterations are
a cause or consequence of the tumorigenic process still
remains unclear [22]. While most of the recent studies
exploring molecular heterogeneity have relied on genomic
analyses, functional protein signaling events, largely
driven by phosphorylation, are the actual drug targets of
many of the new precision therapies (e.g. kinase/enzyme
inhibitors). Consequently, the analysis of the complex
protein-signaling network of tumor cells remains a
central element for better understanding the impact that
tumor heterogeneity has on the selection of treatment
for cancer patients. For these reasons, it is critical to
understand if protein-based data generated form different
regions of the same sample are robust and consistent.
Thus far relatively few studies have focused on the tumor
molecular heterogeneity of the proteome and especially
on the kinome/phosphoproteome, [12, 23-26]. Moreover,
protein analysis of tumor tissue performed in the past
under the auspices of tumor heterogeneity evaluation, have
failed to utilize upfront cellular enrichment/purification
techniques such as Laser Capture Microdissection (LCM).
Such approaches are necessary to eliminate confounding
analytical variability of different cellular populations (e.g.
epithelial cells, endothelial cells, lymphocytes, fibroblasts,
nervous structures etc.), along with the inability to predict
the level of any given protein/phosphoprotein in a specific
cell subpopulation [27].
A number of studies have already demonstrated that
the molecular landscape of metastatic lesions significantly
differ from primary tumors [13-21]. Indeed, systemic
alterations in the phosphoprotein driven signaling
architecture appear early in the tumorigenic process,
such as in breast cancer and skin cancer studies [28,29].
However, the development of metastatic lesions is the
main cause of cancer related-death, and most precision
medicine trials are currently evaluating the molecular
profile of the metastatic lesions directly to identify
“actionable” alterations to be tailored by the new antiwww.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

cancer compounds. Moreover, due to its proximity in the
vascular tree, the liver is one of the most common sites of
metastasis for a variety of cancers such as CRC, breast,
ovary, and it is one of most accessible visceral sites to
biopsy with relatively low morbidity. With an eye towards
applications in the context of precision medicine based
molecular profiling and with these reasons as context, we
sought to explore the nature of intra-tumoral variability
in the context of protein/phosphoprotein signaling with
a focus on “actionable” cell signaling pathways using
hepatic metastasis from colorectal cancer (CRC) as a
model for future, expanded analysis. Reverse Phase
Protein Microarray (RPPA) coupled with LCM was used
to assess the expression/activation level of selected targets
for FDA approved compounds and downstream substrates
across different regions of a metastatic lesion. Previous
findings from our group have identified the AKT-mTOR
pathway as highly activated in liver metastases from CRC
compared to matched primary tumors along with a number
of Receptor Tyrosine Kinases (RTKs) and the downstream
substrate ERK [16]. For these reasons we further explored
changes within the MAPK and the AKT-mTOR pathway
across different areas of the same lesion.

RESULTS
Analysis of the signaling architecture of study set
1
Study Set 1 included 6 surgical specimens with an
average diameter of 2.5 cm. Only a portion of the original
specimen (average of 1.4 cm) was used for this analysis.
Tumor epithelial cells collected from two different areas
of the same lesion were compared within and across
patient(s). In all instances, the two areas analyzed (named
“A” and “B” respectively) were separated by an average
of 5 mm of tissue (Figure 1A). Unsupervised hierarchical
clustering analysis was initially performed to evaluate the
overall signaling architecture of two different areas of the
same lesion.
The 56 proteins/phosphoproteins measured in the
first study set showed that in 4 of the 6 (67%) paired
samples the overall signaling architecture was maintained
across the different areas of the same tumor (Figure 2A).
Because the data seemed to be driven mainly by the two
samples with overall high signal (sample 6b and 4a), the
unsupervised hierarchical clustering analysis was repeated
after the two samples were removed; the second analysis
was consistent with the original findings (Supplementary
Figure 1).
The analysis was then limited to proteins that
are drug targets and downstream enzymatic substrates
of either FDA approved targeted kinase inhibitors or
experimental agents under investigation in clinical trials:

the MAPK and the AKT-mTOR signaling pathways. As
shown in Figure 3A and 3B, two distinct clusters were
detected for both the MAPK and the AKT-mTOR pathway
with one group of patients showing high activation of the
druggable targets and substrates, and the second group
presenting with low activation. Since high and/or low
levels of drug target activation would likely be used to
stratify patients to a targeted treatment, for each patient
we evaluated how many times paired specimens were
contained within the same cluster (e.g. group a and b).
For the MAPK pathway all matched pairs were contained
in the same group (Figure 3A), while for the AKT-mTOR
pathway, 4 of the 6 matched paired (66.6%) where
included in the same cluster (Figure 3B).
To further investigate the role of tumor heterogeneity
at the signaling level, fold changes between and within
patients were evaluated for both pathways (Figure 4A).
Fold changes for the MAPK pathway ranged between
0.04-0.73 within the same lesion and reached values of
5.06 when lesions from different patients were compared.
Intra-patient fold change for the AKT-mTOR pathway was
below 0.7 for 5 of the 6 cases, while it was between 0.01
and 3.57 across patients.

Study Set 2 included metastatic lesions from 9
patients (Figure 1B). Immediately after surgical excision,
two separate areas were isolated from each metastasis
using 18-, 16- and 14- gauge needle. Samples were stored
and processed independently. The average dimension
of the metastases was 2.6 cm and the average distance
between the two areas analyzed was 1.4 cm.
Unsupervised hierarchical clustering analysis
of the activation/phosphorylation state of the 33 drug
targets measured in study set 2 revealed that 5 of the 9
matched pairs (55.5%) were contained within the same
cluster (Figure 2B). As shown for study set 1, when the
unsupervised analysis was limited to the MAPK and AKTmTOR pathway, distinct clusters were detected based on
the activation level of the different components of the
module (Figure 3C and 3D). Four different clusters were
identified for the MAPK pathway. The first cluster (group
a) included 4 samples characterized by high activation
of MEK. Of the four samples included in this group,
two belonged to the same specimen. The second cluster

distance of 0.5 cm, were analyzed (A). For study set 2, two distinct areas, separated by an average of 1.4 cm, were harvested by a certified
pathologist after surgical removal of the metastatic lesion and processed separately (B).

(group b) showed overall low activation of the MAPK
pathway. Of the seven samples included in this cluster,
six belonged to matching pairs. The third cluster (group
c) was characterized by increased activation of BRAF
only; two matched pairs were grouped within this cluster.
Finally the last cluster (group d) showed increased overall
activation of the pathway. Of the three samples included
in this group, two were collected from the same specimen.
Similarly, three major clusters were found for the
AKT-mTOR pathway module. The first group (group a)
showed an overall partial activation of the pathway. Of the
three samples included in this first cluster, two belonged
to the same patient. A large cluster with overall low

activation of the pro-survival pathway included 11 samples
(group b), 10 of which belonged to matching pairs. Finally
group c showed high activation of the rapamycin target
mTOR and direct downstream substrate p70S6K. A total
of four samples collected from two patients were included
in this cluster. Also in this case, intra-tumor heterogeneity
in terms of fold change between matched pairs ranged
between <0.01 and 1.06 for the MAPK pathway and
between 0.03 and 1.04 for the AKT-mTOR pathway. Intertumor heterogeneity fluctuated between 0.13 and 2.62
for MAPK pathway and 0.45 and 3.76 for AKT-mTOR
pathway (Figure 4B).

DISCUSSION

a characteristic dominant activated signal network that
spans the whole population, then a single biopsy may
be an accurate representation of the state of the whole
heterogeneous tumor colony. On the other hand, if each
part of the tumor is different, a set of biopsies would be
required to collect a representative sample. In this study,
we used an LCM-RPPA workflow to address this question
with regard to the signaling architecture of metastatic
lesions in the liver.
A number of studies have demonstrated that biopsies
collected from different areas of the same lesion and
across lesions have substantial variability at the genomic
level with the intra-tumoral heterogeneity being much

The recent discussions concerning intra-tumoral
heterogeneity and clonal expansion has opened a new
debate on the validity of selecting targeted treatment(s)
for cancer patients based on a single tissue biopsy [30].
Given the limitations of safe tissue collection for precision
medicine trials, especially from patients with metastatic
disease, it is important to understand biopsy-to-biopsy
and intra-biopsy molecular variations. For example,
we do not know whether the dominant activated signal
pathways differ between tumor cells sampled at opposite
ends of a core biopsy. If each tumor cell population has

smaller then inter-tumoral heterogeneity [11-13,31-33].
Nonetheless, the impact of genomic heterogeneity on the
proteome and its activation has not been deeply explored
thus far [23-26,34,35]. An aspect of the current narrative
concerning the intra-tumoral genomic heterogeneity
observed in recent studies is whether a major contributor
to the variability observed might be attributed to passenger
genetic alterations that are not under selection pressure and
thus vary more randomly across a given lesion. Because
genomic studies may be unsuited for discriminating
between drivers versus passenger alterations, we
postulated that proteomic studies directly measuring the
functional activation of the drug targets, themselves, may
reveal new insight on the nature of inter- and intra-tumor
heterogeneity.
The approach used in this study offers a number of
attributes that distinguish it from previous work. First,
the direct measurement of phosphorylated drug targets
and downstream substrates provides a direct read-out
on the functional signaling network of the tumor cells
by providing information about which drug targets are
truly activated and whether this activation is affecting the
downstream members of the network. In vitro and in-/exvivo analyses have shown that the direct quantification of
the activation level of targeted proteins and effectors can
successfully be used to predict the therapeutic effect of
biological compounds [36-41]. Second, our study uniquely
used LCM for upfront tumor epithelium isolation and
enrichment, an approach that has never been used before
to explore tumor heterogeneity. Previous studies focused
on inter- and intra-tumor variability analyzed the whole
tissue lysate without upfront tumor epithelial cell isolation

[23,25,26,35]. A number of publications have shown that
upfront cellular enrichment is necessary when conducting
functional proteomics studies because the different
cellular component of the tumor microenvironment can
deeply influence the accuracy of the results [27,42,43].
Without this upfront cellular enrichment, it is impossible
to clearly determine whether any changes seen across
a specimen are due to tumor epithelium molecular
heterogeneity or whether they are simply caused by the
differences in the amount of fibroblasts, adipocytes,
leucocytes, endothelial cells, and nerve cells across the
specimen. Since important signaling drug targets like
AKT, mTOR, ERK are ubiquitously found in every cell
type at various concentrations, it is impossible to control
for this co-variable without isolating the subpopulation of
cells of interest from the outset. Finally, the unique tissue
collection approach we utilized for this study, coupled
to upfront cellular enrichment via LCM, allowed us to
control for a number of pre-analytical variables that are
known to impact the integrity of the phosphoproteome
and proteome (e.g. time between sample collection and
storage, type of fixation method etc. and uncontrolled
cellular heterogeneity in the tissue input) [44]. For
example, because the two areas analyzed in study set
1 were isolated from the same cryosection via direct
visualization under the microscope, this approach allowed
us to control for variability in terms of collection time and
storage across surgical specimens. The approach used for
study set 2, on the other hand, allowed us to mimic sample
collection under radiological guidance, a procedure that
has become part of the standard of care of patients with
metastatic disease. In addition, the two fragments analyzed

were collected concomitantly after surgical excision of
the metastatic lesion to limit variability attributable to
collection time. Despite the unique and novel aspects of
our study sets, our conclusions are constrained by small
sample sizes similar to recent studies [23], and thus will
require further validation in larger study sets in order to
draw definitive conclusions
Overall, these pilot data indicate that the activation
level of a large panel of drug targets and downstream
substrates is quite reproducible/stable across different
areas of the same metastatic lesion, especially compared
to the heterogeneity seen across different patients. These
data imply that for each metastatic colony a single
dominant signaling pathway may drive a majority of the
cellular population, regardless of presumed genetic clonal
heterogeneity. This may signify the existence of dominant
driving signaling pathway within the metastatic colony.
Nonetheless, while the tumor cells throughout a single
metastasis may be similar, they may still be different from
other metastasis in the same or different organs. Drake and
colleagues have recently measured the activation level
of a small panel of kinases within and across different
metastatic lesions from castration resistant prostate cancer
[23]. In concordance with our data, the analysis showed
that the phosphorylation levels were maintained across
different lesions collected from the same patient even for
metastases that developed at different organ sites [23].
As expected, a greater variation in the activated kinome
was observed between lesions collected from different
patients indicating that the inter-patient variability is
much greater than the changes within a single individual.
Similarly, Malinowsky and colleagues have evaluated
tumor heterogeneity in primary breast cancer and matched
metastatic lymph nodes. The results indicated that different
areas of the primary tumors as well as the metastatic
lesions were heterogeneous; nonetheless the differences
seen within the lymph node lesions were slightly smaller
than the one measured across different areas of the
primary tumors. Interestingly, when tumor variability
was evaluated within different patients, the coefficient of
variations were almost double compared to one measured
in the intra-tumor analysis. This study used whole tissue
lysates obtained from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded
(FFPE) tissue sections and analyzed by RPPA [25]. It is
well known that fixation in formalin of different areas of
the tumor is time dependent, and the signaling network of
large FFPE specimens can vary across the different areas
of the lesions based on the time of fixation. Finally, by
using whole tissue lysates where samples are not enriched
for tumor epithelia, the signaling network identified by this
study cannot be attributed to the cancer cells directly, but
rather is an average of all the different cell subpopulations
present in the tissue (including immune cells, nerves,
fibroblasts etc). Finally, a recent work sampling the same
metastatic lesion longitudinally during targeted treatment
showed reproducible intra-tumoral signaling architecture
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

of non- target molecules across different points in time
[45]. Even if sample collection was carried out over time
under CT guidance, and as, consequence, different areas of
the lesion were sampled and analyzed, the data indicated
that the signaling network was robust not only across areas
of the same lesions, but at different points in time.
Our study has limitations that need to be addressed
through further investigations. Due to the low number of
samples enrolled in the study, our data need to be validated
on an independent set where multiple areas of the same
lesions and different lesions are collected from a larger
cohort of patients. Finally, the study sets only included
liver metastasis from colorectal cancer.
Despite the importance of liver metastasis in cancer
progression, our analysis is obviously limited to a single
organ site. The degree of heterogeneity in other metastatic
sites such as bone, brain, chest wall, etc. are not addressed
by our work. Moreover, while we interrogated the AKTmTOR and MEK-ERK signaling pathways due to their
high importance as druggable targets, the degree of
intratumoral heterogeneity in signaling activation in other
drug target networks remains to be more deeply explored.
Nonetheless, our profiling of 55 kinase drug targets did
indicate an overall stable signaling architecture.
Other types of cancers may have a different degree
of intra-tumoral variability at the signaling level and
it could be that the variabilityility is influenced by the
microenvironment of the organ-sites. Matching genomic
profiling was not available for the two study sets analyzed,
and direct evaluation of the genomic variability needs to
be further investigated, especially in relationship to the
protein kinase driven signaling data. While we focused
our tumor heterogeneity analysis on the activation/
phosphorylation state of specific key signaling proteins,
it is it is, unknown not know whether or not these protein
pathways represent the functional/causal “drivers” of
the tumor in any of the patients. Future studies that
incorporate mulit-omic molecular analysis from multiple
independent biopsies obtained from the metastatic lesion
in the context of precision medicine studies with known
clinical outcome will help to better define the impact of
tissue heterogeneity.
This first protein-based drug target activation
analysis of the tumor epithelium obtained from human
metastatic lesions indicates that the activated signaling
architecture is consistently observed within metastatic
lesions collected from the same patient while each
patient’s tumor has distinct patient-specific signaling
portraits. Incorporating proteomic and phosphoproteomic
profiling into the precision medicine workflow is both
possible and could be synergistic with genomic analysis
[46]. If validated on an independent set of samples,
these results could be critically important for precision
medicine applications, especially in the context of tissue
requirements for accurate assessment of the underpinning
molecular detail.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Immunostaining

Two independent study sets of liver metastases from
CRC patients were evaluated in this analysis. Samples
were obtained from the Centro di Riferimento Oncologico
(Aviano, Italy), Istituto Regina Elena (Rome, Italy), and
Istituto Nazionale Tumori (Milan, Italy) where sample
collection was approved by the local IRB. Patients entered
the study voluntarily and provided signed informed
consent prior to sample collection. All samples were
rapidly collected to minimize pre-analytical variables,
snap-frozen, and stored at -80oC until the molecular
analysis was performed.

Before proceeding with immunostaining, arrays
were first incubated in Reblot Stripping solution
(Chemicon, Temecula, CA) for 15 minutes, washed
twice with PBS (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA) and
incubated in I-Block (Tropix, Bedord, MA) for one
hour. Using an automatic system (Dako Cytomation,
Carpinteria, CA), arrays were then incubated with
commercially available 3% hydrogen peroxidase
solution, avidin-biotin blocking system, and protein block
(Dako Cytomation, Carpinteria, CA). The expression/
activation level of a panel of FDA approved and/or under
investigation drug targets and their downstream effectors
was measured using a single primary antibody targeting
the protein and phosphorylation site of interest. Each
antibody used on the array was previously validated using
western blot to confirm its specificity [48]. Fifty-six and
33 primary antibodies were used for study set one and two,
respectively (Supplementary Table 1). A commercially
available tyramide-based avidin/biotin amplification
system (CSA; Dako Cytomation, Carpinteria, CA) and
fluorescent detection (LI-COR Biosciences, Lincoln, NE)
were used to quantify the amount of protein present in
each sample. Antibody stained slides were scanned using
the Tecan laser scanner (Tecan PowerScanner Tecan group
Ltd., Männedorf, Switzerland). Images were analyzed
with MicroVigene 5.1.0.0 (Vigenetech, Carlisle, MA) as
previously described [46]. Because the output of the RPPA
platform is quantitative, the intensity values obtained from
the analysis were reported on a continuous variable.

Laser capture microdissection
For each sample, 10 eight-micron cryo-sections
were prepared. Tumor epithelial cells were isolated
from the surrounding microenvironment using the
ArcturusXT™ LCM System (Arcturus Bioscence,
Mountain View, CA, USA). Approximately 10,000 to
15,000 epithelial cells were isolated from each sample
on CapSure Macro LCM caps (Arcturus Bioscence,
Mountain View, CA, USA). In brief, slides were first fixed
in 70% ethanol, washed in deionized water, stained with
hematoxylin (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA) and Scott’s
tap water substitute (Elec Micros Sci, Hatfield, PA, USA)
followed by dehydration in 70%, 95%, 100% ethanol and
xylene. To preserve post-translation modification such as
phosphorylation, complete mini protease inhibitor tablets
(Roche Applied Science, Indianapolis, IN, USA) were
added to 70 % ethanol, deionized water, hematoxylin,
and Scott’s tap water substitute. Microdissected cells
were lysed in 1:1 solution of Tris-Glycine SDS sample
buffer (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA) and Tissue
Protein Extraction Reagent (T-PER Pierce, Rockford, IL,
USA) with 2.5% β-mercaptoethanol (Sigma, St. Louis,
MO, USA) [27]. Cell lysates were boiled for 8 minutes
and stored at -80°C until further processed.

Statistical analysis
Unsupervised hierarchical clustering analysis was
performed using JMP version 11 (SAS Institute Inc.,
SAS, Cary, NC). The impact of tumor heterogeneity in
two major pathways commonly targeted in different solid
tumors was then evaluated. The MAPK pathway module
of study set 1 and 2 included B-Raf (S445), MEK 1/2
(S217/221), Elk1 (S838) and Erk (T202/Y204). The AKTmTOR pathway module included mTOR (S2448) and its
downstream substrates p70S6K (T389), S6 Ribosomal
Protein (S240/244) and eIF4G (S1108) in study set one
and mTOR (S2448), p70S6K (S371), S6Ribosomal
Protein (S235/236) and eIF4G (S1108) in study set two.
Pathway activation module scores for each sample were
generated by summing the single individual value for each
endpoint included in a given module. For the assessment
of the intra-tumor heterogeneity, fold changes of the
pathway activation score within the two samples of the
same patient were evaluated. Fold change differences
across patients were calculated using the average values
derived from each matched pair. Average values were
then normalized on the lowest value of the series. Data

Reverse phase protein microarray

Array construction
Using a 2470 Aushon arrayer equipped with 185 μm
pins (Aushon BioSystems, Burlington, MA), cell lysates
were printed in triplicate onto nitrocellulose-coated slides
(Grace Bio-Lab, Bend, OR). For quality control purposes,
standard curves were printed on each array along with
the samples. To quantify the amount of total protein in
each sample, selected arrays were stained with Sypro
Ruby staining solution (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR)
following manufacturing recommendation [47].
