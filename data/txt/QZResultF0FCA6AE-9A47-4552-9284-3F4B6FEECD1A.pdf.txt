ABSTRACT
eIF4E binding protein 1 (4E-BP1), is critical for cap-dependent and cap-independent
translation. This study is the first to demonstrate that 4E-BP1 expression correlates
with colorectal cancer (CRC) progression. Compared to its expression in normal colon
epithelial cells, 4E-BP1 was upregulated in CRC cell lines and was detected in patient
tumor tissues. Furthermore, high 4E-BP1 expression was statistically associated with
poor prognosis. Hypoxia has been considered as an obstacle for cancer therapeutics.
Our previous data showed that YXM110, a cryptopleurine derivative, exhibited
anticancer activity via 4E-BP1 depletion. Here, we investigated whether YXM110 could
inhibit protein synthesis under hypoxia. 4E-BP1 expression was notably decreased by
YXM110 under hypoxic conditions, implying that cap-independent translation could be
suppressed by YXM110. Moreover, YXM110 repressed hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (HIF1α) expression, which resulted in decreased downstream vascular endothelial growth
factor (VEGF) expression. These observations highlight 4E-BP1 as a useful biomarker
and therapeutic target, indicating that YXM110 could be a potent CRC therapeutic drug.

and oxaliplatin), several targeted monoclonal antibodies
such as bevacizumab, cetuximab, panitumumab, and
capecitabine have been utilized in the clinic [3].
There has been an increased focus in the past few
years on individualized therapy for cancer treatment.
Traditional systemic chemotherapy often results in offtarget toxicity in patients with a resulting loss in quality
of life. Therefore, the development of prognostic and
predictive markers would be advantageous for the
development of targeted therapeutics. Recently, several
valuable molecular markers have been discovered for
CRC. Microsatellite instability (MSI), a kind of genome
instability, results from a dysfunction in mismatch repair
genes and often occurs in cancers. An evaluation of the

INTRODUCTION
Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most common
cancer and the third leading cause of cancer related deaths
worldwide [1]. Approximately 50–60% of diagnosed CRC
patients will develop metastases. Most cases of CRC are
sporadic, with only a small proportion related to heredity.
It has been reported that some gene mutations increase the
incidence of CRC, including those of APC (adenomatous
polyposis coli), KRAS, MLH1, MSH2, TP53, and EGFR
[2]. Currently, the cornerstone treatment for CRC is
surgery for stage I cases, with adjuvant radiotherapy and
systemic chemotherapy for stages II and III. In addition to
traditional chemotherapy drugs (5-fluorouracil, irinotecan,

effect of high MSI on patient survival in 5-FU treated
and untreated CRC patients demonstrated that untreated
patients with high MSI had improved overall survival
compared to high MSI patients treated with 5-FU [4]. MSI,
18q loss of heterozygosity, p53, SMAD4, thymidylate
synthase, KRAS, and BRAF genes have been shown
to be important indicators of CRC pathogenesis. Other
markers, such as the tumor suppressor, guanylyl cyclase
2 and the nucleotide excision repair gene, ERCC1 are
also being considered as possible predictive markers [5],
which emphasizes the importance of identifying relevant
biomarkers for the design of targeted drugs.
Protein synthesis controls cell growth, cell size
maintenance, proliferation, and the survival of cancer cells
[6]. Translation phases include the rate-limiting step of
initiation, the assembly of the elongation-competent 80S
ribosome, and termination. Translation of mRNAs can
occur in a cap-dependent and cap-independent manner. Captagged mRNAs recruit eukaryotic initiation factors (eIFs),
forming the eIF4F complex, composed of the following
proteins: scaffolding protein eIF4G, RNA helicase eIF4A,
and the cap-binding protein eIF4E [7]. eIFs work together to
initiate the translation process. However, recent studies have
indicated that cap-independent translation may contribute to
cancer progression. Unlike cap-dependent translation, capindependent translation involves access to mRNAs through
an internal ribosome entry site (IRES) without cap binding.
Under cellular stress such as in hypoxia, cap-independent
mRNAs can be translated even when cap-dependent
translation is decreased [8]. Cellular mRNAs that also
contain IRES elements include hypoxia-inducible factor
1α (HIF1A), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGFA),
fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2), and BCL2, all of which
utilize a dual mechanism of initiation (cap or IRES) [9, 10].
4E-BP1, the most common eukaryotic translation
initiation factor of 4E binding proteins (4E-BPs) impacts
cell proliferation, apoptosis, invasion, and metastasis. The
hypophosphorylated active form of 4E-BP1, sequesters
eIF4E and prevents it from binding to eIF4G, thus blocking
the formation of the cap-dependent translation complex
(eIF4F). 4E-BP1 also activates cap-independent translation
by binding to eIF4E [11]. It has been shown that elevated
levels of 4E-BP1 and eIF4G induces hypoxia mediated
inhibition of cap-dependent mRNA translation and increases
the translation of mRNAs containing IRES. This leads to
angiogenesis, hypoxia resistance, and survival [6, 8]. Capindependent translation is also highly correlated with drug
resistance under hypoxic conditions [12].
Oxygen is necessary for cells to produce adequate
amounts of ATP to support cellular metabolic activities.
Hypoxic conditions are often observed within cancer tissues,
due to the high proliferation rates and vascular abnormalities
[13]. Hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1), an oxygensensitive transcription factor, initiates adaptive responses to
changes in oxygen tension in various microenvironments
[14]. HIF-1 is a heterodimer protein complex composed
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

of a constitutively expressed HIF-1β subunit and a highly
regulated HIF-1α subunit [15]. The balance between protein
synthesis and protein degradation determines the expression
level of HIF-1α. During hypoxia, the protein synthesis
process for HIF-1α mRNA switches from cap-dependent
to cap-independent (IRES-dependent) translation [6].
Accumulated HIF-1α dimerizes with HIF-1β and binds to
hypoxia-response elements (HREs) within the promoters of
target genes, such as VEGF, glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1),
erythropoietin (EPO), and nitric oxide synthase (NOS)
[16]. HIF-1α overexpression and activation stimulates
several key pathways in carcinogenesis, such as those
related to angiogenesis, anaerobic glucose metabolism,
dedifferentiation, and invasion [13].
The phenanthroquinolizidine alkaloid cryptopleurine,
is a natural product isolated from the Asclepiadaceae and
Moraceae families. Its anticancer activity in drug-resistant
cancer cells has been elucidated [17–19]. YXM110 was
shown to be the most potent cryptopleurine derivative against
seven cancer cell lines. We previously reported that YXM110
inhibited global protein synthesis, and stimulated the
degradation of 4E-BP1 and regulation of autophagy, which
ultimately led to tumor suppression [20]. YXM110 induced
decrease in 4E-BP1 expression in an in vivo xenograft model
further confirmed its antitumor effect (unpublished data).
We previously also found that under hypoxic conditions,
YXM110 had the ability to reduce 4E-BP1 protein levels
and compared to paclitaxel, cells showed less resistance to
YXM110. Consequently, we suggested that 4E-BP1 depletion
could be a benefit for an anticancer drug development.
To our knowledge, this study is the first to
demonstrate that the expression of 4E-BP1 correlates with
patient survival time and recurrence in CRC. Significantly
increased 4E-BP1 levels were observed in all colon cancer
cell lines tested as well as in the cancer tissues of patients.
Clinical pathology analysis demonstrated that 4E-BP1
expression is associated with poor prognosis and cancer
stage. Under hypoxia, 4E-BP1 is thought to be an important
factor for cap-independent translation. Our previous
study showed that YXM110 significantly suppressed
the expression of 4E-BP1 [20]. Therefore, in the present
study, we investigated whether YXM110 could inhibit
protein synthesis under hypoxic conditions. We found that
YXM110 markedly decreased 4E-BP1 expression, resulting
in diminished HIF-1α-regulated VEGF expression. Taken
together, our findings indicate that 4E-BP1 could be a
valuable prognostic biomarker, and YXM110 appears to be
a promising lead compound for CRC therapy.

RESULTS
4E-BP1 is upregulated in CRC cell lines and
tumor tissues
To elucidate the mechanistic link between 4E-BP1
and CRC, we assessed the basal levels of 4E-BP1 in 6 colon

cancer cell lines (SW480, SW620, Colo205, Caco-2, HCT116,
and HT-29) and 1 normal colon cell line, CCD-18co, under
normoxia and hypoxia. The lowest basal protein expression
levels of 4E-BP1 were observed in normal CCD-18co colon
cells compared to colon cancer cell lines, under normoxic
and hypoxic conditions (Figure 1A, 1B and Supplementary
Figure S1A). In addition, the expression of 4E-BP1 was
dramatically increased under hypoxic conditions, especially
in the CRC cells, compared to its expression under normoxic
conditions. This indicates that 4E-BP1 might mediate hypoxiainduced drug resistance (Figure 1C). Notably, the expression
levels of 4E-BP1 in SW480, SW620, and Colo205 cells,
derived from Duke’s B-, C-, and D-type CRC, respectively,
appeared to be elevated depending on disease progression.
Caco-2 is a well-differentiated colon cancer cell line. However,
4E-BP1 levels in these cells were only slightly higher than in
normal CCD-18co cells.
4E-BP1 expression in CRC tissues was also
evaluated, and 4E-BP1 was more highly expressed in
cancerous colon and rectal tissue sections than in the
corresponding non-cancerous sections (Figure 2A, 2B).
The liver is the predominant metastatic site for CRC
patients. Therefore, we also assessed 4E-BP1 expression
levels in the liver in rectum metastases patients. Liver
tissue from non-metastatic CRC patients expressed lower
levels of 4E-BP1 than liver tissue from metastatic CRC
patients. Taken together, the above results suggest that
4E-BP1 expression and tumor progression are related.

4E-BP1 expression exhibited longer survival times
(Figure 3A) and longer time to recurrence (Figure 3B;
p = 0.028 and 0.003, respectively). Taken together, these
results indicate that the expression levels of 4E-BP1
directly correlate with CRC progression, patient survival,
and recurrence. Therefore, 4E-BP1 could be a prognostic
indicator and potential therapeutic target.

YXM110 inhibits 4E-BP1 expression under
hypoxic conditions and suppresses
cap-independent translation via 4E-BP1 deletion
Hypoxia is regarded as an obstacle to effective
cancer therapy. It can cause a switch from cap-dependent
to cap-independent translation [8], a process controlled
mainly by 4E-BP1. As shown in Figure 1C, 4E-BP1 is
upregulated in cancer cells under hypoxia, and YXM110
has been shown to inhibit its expression [20]. Therefore,
we assessed the ability of YXM110 to decrease 4E-BP1
protein expression under hypoxic conditions. We observed
that 4E-BP1 was significantly repressed by YXM110 under
hypoxia, but this was not mediated by mTOR inhibition
(Figure 4A). This implies that cap-independent translation
is inhibited by YXM110. We confirmed that YXM110
suppressed cap-independent translation when 4E-BP1 was
overexpressed by using a bicistronic vector harboring capdependent firefly luciferase and cap-independent Renilla
luciferase genes (Figure 4B). Compared to paclitaxel,
HCT116 cells under hypoxic conditions demonstrated
increased sensitivity to YXM110 [20]. These results
suggest that YXM110-induced 4E-BP1 depletion reduces
the survival of cancer cells under oxygen-deprivation by
making them more sensitive to anticancer agents.

Association of 4E-BP1 expression with
clinical parameters
The association between 4E-BP1 and several clinical
parameters, including sex, age, TNM, and cancer stage, was
analyzed in 192 CRC patients (Table 1). Cancerous and
non-cancerous tissues were sectioned into four parts for 4EBP1 staining. No positive sections or only one positively
stained section was defined as having “low” expression of
4E-BP1, and the presence of at least two positively stained
sections was classified as “high” expression (Figure 3C).
Table 1 indicates that 4E-BP1 expression in CRC patients
does not correlate with age, gender, T factor (the size of the
original tumor) or M factor (distant metastasis). However,
we observed a significant statistical correlation with the
N factor (lymph node invasion; p = 0.029) and 4E-BP1
expression. It is noteworthy that 4E-BP1 expression was
more prevalent in patients diagnosed at a late stage (stages
III and IV; p = 0.027).

YXM110 inhibits HIF-1α translation
The HIF-1 protein activates adaptive responses to
hypoxic conditions [14]. During hypoxia, cap-dependent
translation can switch to cap-independent (IRESdependent) translation of HIF-1α mRNA [6]. Therefore,
mRNA and protein levels of HIF-1α were examined
after YXM110 treatment under normoxia and hypoxia.
We showed that HIF-1α mRNA expression is indeed
increased during hypoxia (Figure 5). However, protein
expression of HIF-1α was not detectable by western
blot analysis (Figure 5B), suggesting that the translation
process was blocked. Pretreatment with the proteasome
inhibitor, MG132 could not reverse YXM110 mediated
HIF-1α downregulation (Figure 5C). However, HIF-1β
protein levels were also decreased after YXM110
treatment (Supplementary Figure S2), including HIF-1β
without IRES-dependent translation. There may be
other mechanisms that facilitate YXM110 mediated
HIF-1β downregulation. These results suggest that
hypoxia-activated cap-independent translation is
inhibited by YXM110.

Survival analysis
The correlation between 4E-BP1 expression and
clinical outcome was corroborated by a survival analysis.
The patients enrolled in this study did not receive any
chemotherapy before surgical resection. A Kaplan-Meier
analysis showed that patients with negative results for

YXM110 inhibits HRE-luciferase activity and
VEGF transcription and translation

and a tissue microarray confirmed this result in tumors.
Moreover, 4E-BP1 expression positively correlated with
poor prognosis. YXM110, a new phenanthroquinolizidine,
notably suppressed 4E-BP1 expression under hypoxia,
with concomitant inhibition of HIF-1α-regulated VEGFA
transcription and translation. Therefore, we contend that
4E-BP1 could be a valuable target for CRC treatment.
Translational regulation is crucial in cancer
development and progression and can initiate tumor
cell survival, angiogenesis, invasion, and metastasis.
Translation of mRNAs is controlled by dual mechanisms at
the level of initiation: cap-dependent and cap-independent
(IRES-dependent) translation [6]. Substantial evidence
has shown that global protein synthesis, which is mostly
regulated by cap-dependent translation, promotes tumor
cell growth and survival. In cap-dependent translation,
the rate-limiting step of initiation is controlled by eIF4E,
the 5′ cap-binding protein, 4E-BP1, and the eIF4Ebinding protein. Therefore, the roles of the interaction and
expression of eIF4E and 4E-BP1 in cancer progression has
been widely examined. mTOR hyperphosphorylated 4EBP1 is inactive and unable to bind to eIF4E in the steady
state, indicating that eIF4E can initiate mRNA translation.
Therefore, p-4E-BP1 is regarded as a proto-oncogene
and even as a “funnel factor” in human cancers [21].
Many diverse oncogenic signals, such as Her2, Ras-Raf,
and PI3K-Akt converge at 4E-BP1, affecting cancer cell

HIF-1 is a known transcription factor for dozens of
hypoxia induced target genes [13–16]. HIF-1 regulates
transcription at the hypoxia-responsive element (HRE)
domain of the promoter. Therefore, we measured the
transcriptional activity of HIF-1 via the expression of
the downstream target gene VEGF. HCT116 cells were
transfected with a reporter plasmid containing five
copies of HRE with the luciferase promoter gene. The
transcriptional activity of HIF-1 in hypoxic cells was
approximately 3,000 fold higher than in normoxic cells.
However, YXM110 effectively inhibited the hypoxiainduced transcriptional activity of HIF-1 (Figure 6A), and
the transcription of hypoxia-increased VEGFA mRNA
expression (Figure 6B). Furthermore, the levels of secreted
VEGF decreased with YXM110 treatment (Figure 6C).
Taken together, the results indicate that YXM110 inhibited
HIF-1α translation and its transcriptional activity.

DISCUSSION
The aim of this study was to demonstrate the
importance of 4E-BP1 expression in CRC. All colon
cancer lines evaluated exhibited higher 4E-BP1 protein
levels than normal cells under normoxia and hypoxia,

proliferation, invasion, and metastasis [22]. Studies have
shown that in breast cancer, p-4E-BP1 is mainly expressed
in poorly differentiated tumors, and correlates with tumor
size, lymph node metastasis, and recurrence [23, 24]. The
ratio of 4E-BP1 to eIF4E is an indicator of rapamycin
sensitivity [25, 26] in cancer cells. Increasing evidence
indicates that dephosphorylation of 4E-BP1 can serve as
a clinical biomarker, and mimetic compounds of 4E-BP1
have recently been developed [27].
However, cap-dependent mRNA translation is
inhibited and cap-independent translation is enhanced in
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

response to a variety of cell stressors, including growth
arrest, nutrient deprivation, mitosis, hypoxia, and apoptosis
[6, 11]. This suggests that cap-independent translation also
plays an important role in cancer. Several studies have
demonstrated that 4E-BP1 expression is elevated in human
breast, prostate, head and neck, and some gastrointestinal
cancers [28–30]. Furthermore, mTOR-independent 4E-BP1
expression and phosphorylation have been reported as a
mechanism of primary resistance to mTOR kinase inhibitors
[31–33]. Reports have shown that colon cell origin is a
strong predictor for mTOR inhibitor resistance [31, 32]. In

addition, 4E-BP1 overexpression is associated with poor
prognosis and endocrine resistance in breast cancer [33].
As shown in Figure 1, compared to the normal colon
cell line, all cancer cell lines tested had increased 4E-BP1
levels under both normoxic and hypoxic conditions. The
IHC staining of patient tumors provided strong evidence
that 4E-BP1 is upregulated in cancerous tissues (Figure 2).
Cell line analysis demonstrated that poor progression of
CRC is associated with increased 4E-BP1 protein levels.
These data are corroborated by the analysis of clinical
pathology parameters. Patients with lymph node metastasis
had statistically significant high 4E-BP1 expression, which
correlated with late-stage CRC (Table 1). This was also
associated with survival and recurrence time, as patients
with low 4E-BP1 expression had better clinical outcomes
(Figure 3).
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

We also determined the expression levels of eIF4E
and p-4E-BP1 in colorectal cancer cell lines and normal
cells. As shown in Supplementary Figure S1B and S1D,
eIF4E and p-4E-BP1 were upregulated in most colorectal
cancer cells under normoxia and hypoxia. However, it is
noteworthy that the expression levels of eIF4E and p-4EBP1 were decreased in hypoxia compared to normoxia
in most colorectal cells except for SW480 and SW620
cells, which suggest a role for eIF4E and p-4E-BP1 in
cap-dependent translation. Moreover, the analysis of
clinical CRC tumor tissues indicates that there is a positive
association between 4E-BP1 and eIF4E protein expression
(Supplementary Table 1), suggesting that eIF4E may
have a similar role as 4EBP in CRC tumorigenesis.
Since the loss of 4E-BP1 or eIF4E overexpression can
promote tumorigenesis, the ratio of 4E-BP1 to eIF4E in

colorectal cancer cells was also evaluated. Supplementary
Figure S1C shows that the ratio of 4E-BP1 to eIF4E
dramatically increased in cancer cells, especially under
hypoxia.
Tumor hypoxia is considered as an obstacle
to efficient cancer treatment with radiotherapy and
chemotherapy because it acts as a barrier in the tumor
region. Recent evidence has shown that tumor hypoxia
is associated with more malignant phenotypes and
poor prognosis. Therefore, developing selectively
targeted therapy to hypoxic cells is an ongoing area
of research [34]. In several reported studies, 4E-BP1
has been demonstrated to be a positive regulator of
cap-independent mRNA translation under hypoxic
conditions. Tumor hypoxia induced 4E-BP1, decreases
cap-dependent translation and activates cap-independent
translation of mRNAs encoding HIF1α and VEGFA,
which contributes to cell survival and angiogenesis [8].
YXM110 significantly depleted 4E-BP1 expression
without mTOR inhibition, decreased 4E-BP1 mediated
cap-independent translation HIF-1α translation and its
transcriptional activity under hypoxia (Figures 4–6).
These results suggest that YXM110 represses hypoxiaactivated cap-independent translation.
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Based on the findings described in Table 1, we
concluded that 4EBP1 expression is associated with
N factor, which indicates that nearby (regional) lymph
nodes are involved in CRC progression, as well as TNM
stage. It has been reported that soluble VEGF-A was
associated with lymphangiogenensis [35]. Moreover,
the expression VEGF-A and VEGF-C was significantly
elevated in CRCs, and tumors with lymph node metastases
had significantly higher levels of VEGF-A compared with
non-metastatic tumors [36, 37]. We therefore evaluated the
expression levels of VEGF-A and VEGF-C after YXM110
treatment and showed that YXM110 depleted VEGF-A
and VEGF-C expression at the transcriptional level
(Figure 6 and Supplementary Figure S3). However, it was
found that hypoxia induces VEGF-C expression via a HIF1α-independent translation-mediated mechanism [38].
We speculated that VEGF-C translational downregulation
might be due to YXM110 mediated cap-independent
inhibition rather than a 4E-BP1-HIF-1αpathway.
Akt/mTOR signaling is known to regulate protein
synthesis. YXM110 was proved to have an ability to inhibit
protein synthesis even that YXM110 induced mTOR
signaling activation (Figure 4A) [20]. It was also shown
that extracellular signals activate mTOR, which in turns

triggers HIF-1α induction though transcriptional regulation
[39]. Although HIF-1α mRNA was induced after treatment
with YXM110, HIF-1α protein was profoundly suppressed
by YXM110 in a translational manner (Figure 5). Hypoxia
can cause cell cycle arrest and simultaneously suppresses
conversion from proliferative arrest to cellular senescence
[40-41]. Nonetheless, inhibition of 4E-BP1 can sensitize
cells, which is hypoxia tolerance and radioresistance, to
chemotherapy and irradiation [42]. We recently reported
that compared to anticancer drugs, YXM110 can reduce
the survival of cancer cells during hypoxia [20]. These
combined observations strongly suggest that YXM110, an
inhibitor of 4E-BP1, may be an effective agent for treating
drug-resistant CRC.

In conclusion, to the best of our knowledge, this
study is the first to demonstrate the significance of 4EBP1 in CRC through clinical data. Although 4E-BP1
expression is paradoxically elevated in some tumors and
can act as a tumor suppressor or proto-oncogene, we
emphasize that, in this study, the expression of 4E-BP1 is
associated with poor prognosis in CRC. Here we provide
a novel mechanism of action for the cryptopleurine
derivative, YXM110. We show that it significantly
depletes 4E-BP1 expression and subsequently induces
the suppression of cap-independent translation with the
inhibition of HIF-1α-regulated VEGFA transcription
under hypoxia, which facilitates drug resistance.
Therefore, from a therapeutic perspective, 4E-BP1 could

were performed in hypoxia chamber, which was flushed
with 1% O2, 5% CO2, and 94% N2 at 37°C (BioSpherix
Proox 110), and incubated for the indicated time.

Western blot analysis

MATERIALS AND METHODS

For total lysate, cells were lysed with the 120
μL ice-cold lysis buffer [10 mmol/L Tris-HCl (pH
7.4), 150 mmol/L NaCl, 1 mmol/L EGTA, 1 mmol/L
phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/mL aprotinin, 10
μg/mL leupeptin, 1 mM sodium orthovandate, 1 mM NaF,
and 1% Triton X-100]. Cell lysates were centrifuged at 13,
000 rpm for 30 min. For Western blot analysis, the amount
of protein (40–60 μg) was separated by electrophoresis
in 10%-15% polyacrylamide gels and transferred to
polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membranes. After
1 h incubation at room temperature in PBS/5% nonfat
milk, the membrane was washed with PBS/0.1% Tween
20 and incubated with the indicated antibodies at 4°C
overnight. After washing with PBS/0.1% Tween 20,
the corresponding secondary antibodies were applied
to the membranes for 1 h at room temperature. The
membranes were then washed with PBS/0.1% Tween 20
and the detection of signal was done with an enhanced
chemiluminescence detection kit.

Study subjects
Primary colorectal cancer patients were admitted
to Taipei Medical University Hospital, China Medical
University Hospital and Chung Shan Medical University
Hospital. All of them wrote informed consent approved by
the Institutional Review Board (IRB number: 201402018
and 201312018). The enrolled patients did not receive
any chemotherapy or radiation therapy prior to surgery.
The TNM stages of all colorectal cancer patients were
determined according to the American Joint Committee
on Cancer/International Union Against Cancer TNM
staging system.

Immunohistochemical staining for 4E-BP1
protein expression
Non-cancerous and colorectal cancer tissues were
sectioned from patients and formalin-fixed and paraffinembedded. These sections were deparaffinized with
xylen, rehydrated in different concentration of alcohol
and immersed in 3% H202 for removing endogenous
peroxidase. Sections were heated in a microwave in citrate
buffer (pH 6.0) for antigen retrieval. Washing with PBS,
the sections were blocked with 3% BSA/PBS for 30 min
and incubated with anti-4E-BP1 antibody (Cell Signaling)
at 4°C overnight. The streptavidin peroxidase method was
performed (Dako, LSAB kit) to develop the signal.

Quantitative RT-PCR
Total RNA was extracted with TRIzol reagent by
the manufacturer’s protocol (Invitrogen, USA). 5 μg
mRNA was incubated with random primer at 65°C for
5 min, then mixed with M-MLV RT at 37°C for 1 h to
obtain cDNA. The SYBR Green PCR reaction (SYBR®
Green PCR Master Mix; Roche, Switzerland) was used to
evaluate the amplification of HIF-1α and VEGFA genes.
Primer sequences used for amplification are as follows:
HIF-1α, 5′-ATC CAT GTG ACC ATG AGG AAA TG3′ and 3′-TCG GCT AGT TAG GGT ACA CTT C-5′;
HIF-1β, 5′-TTTATCCCTAGAGATGGGTACAGG-3′
and 5′-CCACAGGCTGGACAGAAACC-3; VEGFA,
5′-AAC CAT GAG TTT ATC GCC ACC-3′ and 5′AGC GTT ACA TTG CCT GCA TTT-3′; VEGF-C,
5′-GCCAACCTCAACTCAAGGAC-3′ and 5′-CCCACA
TCTGTAGACGGACA-3′. Fluorescent signal was
detected and recorded by StepOne Real-Time PCR System
(Applied Biosystems, USA), and each amplification
reaction was checked for the absence of nonspecific PCR
products by melting curve. Relative fold changes in gene
expression are calculated as 2-∆∆Ct.

Cell culture and hypoxia
Human colorectal cancer cell line HCT116, HT-29
and Colo205 were purchased from American Type Culture
Collection (ATCC; Manassas, VA, USA). SW480, SW620,
Caco-2 and CCD-18co were kindly gift from Min-Chuan
Huang (Graduate institute of Anatomy and Cell Biology,
College of Medicine, National Taiwan University) and
Kuen-Haur Lee (Program for Cancer Biology and Drug
Discovery, College of Medical Science and Technology,
Taipei Medical University). HCT116, HT-29 and Colo205
were cultured in RPMI-1640 medium (Gibco, Invitrogen,
Carlsbad, CA, USA); SW480, SW620 and Caco-2 were
maintained in DMEM medium (Gibco, Invitrogen,
Carlsbad, CA, USA); CCD-18co was in MEM medium
(Gibco, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA). All of them were
supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated FBS, penicillin
100 U/ml, streptomycin 100 μg/ml, and amphotericin B
2.5 μg/ml. Cells were maintained at 37°C in a humidified
incubator with 5% CO2/95% air. Hypoxia incubations
