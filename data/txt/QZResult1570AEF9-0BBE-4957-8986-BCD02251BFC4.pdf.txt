ABSTRACT
Heat shock protein (HSP) expression is induced by the exposure to stress,
such as fever, oxidative stress, chemical exposure, and irradiation. In cancer, HSP
promotes the survival of malignant cells by inhibiting the induction of apoptosis.
In colorectal cancer, a loss-of-function mutation of HSP110 (HSP110ΔE9) has been
identified. HSP110ΔE9 inhibits the nuclear translocation of wild-type HSP110, which
is important for its chaperone activity and anti-apoptotic effects. The patients carrying
HSP110ΔE9 mutation exhibit high sensitivity to anticancer agents, such as oxaliplatin
and 5-fluorouracil.There is still insufficient information about HSP110 localization,
the clinicopathological significance of HSP110 expression, and its association
with chemotherapy resistance in gastric cancer. Here, we found that high nuclear
expression of HSP110 in gastric cancer tissues is associated with cancer progression,
poor prognosis, and recurrence after adjuvant chemotherapy. In vitro results showed
that HSP110 suppression increases the sensitivity to 5-fluorouracil and cisplatin of
human gastric cancer cell lines. Our results suggest that nuclear HSP110 may be a
new drug sensitivity marker for gastric cancer and a potential molecular therapeutic
target for the treatment of gastric cancer patients with acquired anticancer drug
resistance.

INTRODUCTION

polypeptides, participate in the refolding of proteins that
have been damaged, and sequester damaged proteins
and target them for degradation [6, 7]. Mammalian HSPs
are classified into several protein families based on their
molecular weight, namely HSP25/HSP27, HSP40, HSP60,
HSP70, HSP90, and HSP110 (also called HSP105)
families [8, 9]. HSP70 family proteins are expressed in the
cytoplasm and nucleus of mammalian cells [10]. HSP105α
and HSP105β, the alternatively spliced products of HSP110
family, are expressed in the cytoplasm (HSP105α) and in
nucleus (HSP105β) [11]. Previously, it was reported that
nuclear HSPs behave as molecular chaperones in cells [10].
HSPs were shown to be overexpressed in a
wide range of human carcinomas, including both solid
tumors and hematological malignancies [7, 12, 13]. In
cancer, HSP promotes the survival of malignant cells by

Gastric cancer is one of the most common cancers
worldwide and it is particularly prevalent in Asia [1]. Patients
with early-stage gastric cancer have a good prognosis
following endoscopic or surgical treatment [2], but advanced
or recurrent gastric cancer patients have high mortality
rates, due to chemotherapy resistance [3]. Therefore, the
investigations of the mechanisms of chemotherapy resistance
are necessary, in order to improve patient outcomes.
Heat shock proteins (HSPs) are molecular
chaperones that facilitate the proper folding and function
of proteins. The expression of HSPs is induced by the
exposure to stress, such as fever, oxidative stress, chemical
exposure, and irradiation [4, 5]. HSPs provide protection
against protein aggregation, facilitate folding of nascent

protecting several oncoproteins from degradation and
inhibiting the induction of apoptosis. This suggests that
HSP roles are beneficial for cancerous cells and therefore
deleterious for cancer patients [14]. High levels of HSPs
may correlate with poor prognosis in several types of
cancer. For example, high levels of HSP27 were shown
to correlate with poor prognosis in ovarian cancer [15],
and HSP60 overexpression was correlated with tumor
progression and poor prognosis in colon cancer [16]
and prostate carcinoma [17]. The elevated expression of
HSP70 is associated with poor prognosis in breast [18] and
endometrial [19] cancers, while high HSP90 expression is
associated with poor prognosis in invasive ductal breast
carcinoma [20] but with good prognosis in endometrial
cancer [19]. Furthermore, it was reported that various
HSPs, including HSP70 and HSP90, are associated with
increased chemosensitivity and may represent potential
therapeutic targets in refractory malignancies [21–23].
Antitumor response generated by autologous tumorderived HSP/GRPs (e.g., Hsp70, Hsp90, Grp94/gp96, and
calreticulin) has been well documented [9, 24, 25]. Studies
over the last decade showed that certain tumor-derived
HSPs can serve as effective cancer vaccines, and this
has been attributed to an HSP-carried peptide antigenic
‘fingerprint’ of the tumor [24, 26–29].
Dorard et al. identified a loss-of-function mutation
of HSP110 (HSP110ΔE9) in colorectal cancers with
microsatellite instability [30]. HSP110ΔE9 lacks a substratebinding domain, and it is unable to play a role of a molecular
chaperone for other HSPs (HSP70 or HSP27). Mutant
HSP110ΔE9 protein associates with wild-type HSP110,
blocking its translocation into the nucleus and its chaperone
functions. Therefore, HSP110ΔE9 overexpression enhances
the sensitivity of tumors to anticancer agents, such as
oxaliplatin and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) [30].

However, HSP110 localization, its clinico­
pathological significance, and its association with
chemotherapy resistance in gastric cancer have not been
completely elucidated. The objectives of this study were
to clarify the significance of HSP110 expression in gastric
cancer patients and to assess the effects of HSP110
suppression on chemosensitivity.

RESULTS
Clinical significance of nuclear HSP110
expression in gastric cancer patients
Nuclear HSP110 expression was immunohis­
tochemically evaluated using a tissue microarray that
included 210 gastric cancer samples. HSP110 expression
in cancer tissues was higher compared with non-cancerous
tissues. In the cancer tissues, nucleus and cytoplasm were
positive for HSP110 immunostaining (Figure 1A and 1B).
In non-cancerous tissues, no or weak staining was
observed for HSP110. Nuclear HSP110 expression scores
in 210 gastric cancer samples were as follows: 0, 17
(8.1%) samples; 1+, 72 (34.3%) samples; 2+, 80 (38.1%)
samples; and 3+, 41(19.5%) samples. Eighty-nine
(42.4%) samples were included in the low expression
group, and 121 (57.6%) samples were included in the
high expression group. The relationship of nuclear
HSP110 expression and clinicopathological factors
from 210 gastric cancer patients is presented in Table 1.
High nuclear expression of HSP110 was significantly
associated with venous invasion (P = 0.0464). The
overall survival rate in the high expression group was
significantly lower compared with the low expression
group (P =  0.0169; Figure 2). Multivariate regression
analysis revealed that high expression of nuclear

HSP110 is an independent prognostic factor for
gastric cancer outcome (P = 0.0068), as are the tumor
depth (P < 0.001) and venous invasion (P  =  0.0276;
Table 2). Additionally, we assessed cytoplasmic HSP110
expression in 210 gastric cancer tissue samples. No
significant difference in prognosis was observed
between the cytoplasmic HSP110 high expression group
and low expression group (P = 0.6884, Supplementary
Figure S1). Furthermore, additional analysis was
performed in order to evaluate the significance of total
HSP110 expression in gastric cancer tissues. The high
cytoplasmic and nuclear HSP110 expression groups
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

were defined as total HSP110  high expression group
(n = 74). The low cytoplasmic and nuclear HSP110
expression groups were defined as total HSP110  low
expression group (n = 73). There was no significant
prognostic difference between the total HSP110 high
expression group and low expression group (P = 0.2021,
Supplementary Figure S2). The relationship between
total HSP110 expression and clinicopathological factors
is shown in Supplementary Table  S1. No significant
relationships were found between total HSP110
expression and clinicopathological factors, with the only
exception being patients’ ages.

Prognostic significance of nuclear HSP110
expression in gastric cancer patients who
received adjuvant chemotherapy

cells were treated with 5-FU or cisplatin. The sensitivity
to 5-FU and cisplatin of HSP110 siRNA-treated cells was
significantly higher compared with the parent and control
cells (P < 0.05; Figure 4D).

Forty-eight of the 210 gastric cancer patients
received 5-FU-based adjuvant chemotherapy. We evaluated
the correlation between nuclear HSP110 expression and
prognosis in these patients (Figure 3A and 3B). Among
patients who received adjuvant chemotherapy, the
overall survival rate in the high expression group was
significantly lower compared with the low expression
group (P = 0.0364). There was no significant difference
in disease-free survival between the two groups, but the
disease-free survival rate in the high expression group
tended to be lower compared with the low expression
group (P = 0.0743).

DISCUSSION
Here, we determined that high nuclear expression
of HSP110 in gastric cancer tissues is associated with
cancer progression and poor prognosis. Among patients
who received adjuvant chemotherapy, those included in
the high HSP110 expression group showed significantly
shorter overall survival compared with the low expression
group. In vitro study showed that HSP110 suppression
increases the sensitivity to 5-FU and cisplatin in human
gastric cancer cell lines.
Immunohistochemical analysis demonstrated that
the high expression of nuclear HSP110 is associated with
poor overall survival. Based on the multivariate analysis of
the factors affecting overall survival, the high expression
of nuclear HSP110 was shown to be an independent
prognostic factor. Previously, it was reported that the high
expression of HSP110 is associated with poor prognosis
in lung adenocarcinoma [31] and colorectal cancer [32],
and our results are consistent with these reports. The
chaperoning properties of HSP110 are integral to the
ability of these molecules to modulate immune functions
and for the development of large chaperone complex
vaccines for cancer immunotherapy [9]. Nakajima et al.
reported that high cytoplasmic HSP110 expression induces
CD4+ T lymphocyte infiltration, which was shown to be
associated with good prognosis in esophageal cancer [33].
We assessed total and cytoplasmic HSP110 expression

HSP110 expression in gastric cancer cell lines
HSP110 expression was detected using western blot
in all human gastric cancer cell lines (MKN7, MKN45,
MKN74, AZ521) (Figure 4A). MKN7 and MKN45 were
further used for the in vitro analyses of the effects of
HSP110 suppression in gastric cancer cell lines. HSP110
expression was suppressed in MKN7 and MKN45 cells
treated with HSP110 siRNA (Figure 4B and 4C).

in gastric cancer samples, but no significant prognostic
differences were observed in the total and cytoplasmic
HSP110 expression between the high and low groups
(Supplementary Figures S1, S2). It was previously
reported that wild-type nuclear, rather than cytoplasmic,
HSP110 prevents the induction of apoptosis in colorectal
cancer cells [30]. Therefore, we suggest that nuclear
HSP110 expression levels may be a useful prognostic and
drug sensitivity marker for gastric cancer.

In this study, the high expression of nuclear HSP110
was shown to be associated with venous invasion (Table 1).
HSPs promote cancer progression in several cancer types,
and Gong et al. [34] reported that the invasion potential of
hepatocarcinoma cells is increased by HMGB1-induced
tumor NF-κB signaling, through the activation of HSP70.
Sims et al. [35] reported that extracellular HSP70 and
HSP90α contribute to the matrix metalloproteinase-2
activation and breast cancer cell migration and invasion.

in the high expression group tended to be lower compared with the low expression group (P = 0.0743).

It has also been reported that HSP110 is co-expressed with
HSP70 and HSP90 during stress, and that it promotes
HSP90 activity and may function as a nucleotide exchange
factor for cytosolic HSP70 [36]. We elucidated whether
HSP110 expression can facilitate cancer invasion through
the activation of HSP70 and HSP90.
Hosaka et al. [37] reported that HSP110 suppression
induces apoptosis in cancer cell lines but not in fibroblasts.
Dorard et al. [30] identified a loss-of-function mutation
of HSP110 (HSP110ΔE9) in colorectal cancer with
microsatellite instability. HSP110ΔE9 overexpression
enhanced cancer cell sensitivity to anticancer agents. Here,
low nuclear HSP110 expression group had better prognosis
compared with the high expression group, and HSP110
suppression was shown to increase cell sensitivity to 5-FU
and cisplatin in human gastric cancer cell lines, which
is consistent with the previous reports. Novel treatment
strategies, combining an HSP110 inhibitor and an anticancer
agent, may be effective for the treatment of gastric cancer
patients with acquired anticancer drug resistance.
Previously, HSP110 was identified as a cancer
antigen in various human carcinomas [31, 32]. We report

here that the high expression of the nuclear HSP110
was observed in gastric cancer patients. Wang et al. [29]
developed a vaccine composed of a recombinant protein
coupled with large heat shock protein. Our results suggest
that chemosensitivity may decrease due to heat stressinduced HSP110 expression. Therefore, various vaccines,
which may utilize HSPs (i.e., covalent coupling, isolation
of HSPs with antigens attached, recombinant vaccines
made by heat-denaturation of full-length antigens and
HSP110) may be useful in anticancer treatments.
HSP110-specific siRNAs were used to suppress the
expression of HSP110 in gastric cancer cell lines, which
presents a limitation of this study. Therefore, total HSP110
expression was suppressed, and not only the specific
nuclear HSP110 expression. Total HP110 expression
was strongly suppressed in MKN7 and MKN45 by
the HSP110-specific siRNA, but this is probably the
consequence of the suppression of both nuclear and
cytoplasmic HSP110 expression.
In conclusion, the high expression of nuclear
HSP110 was shown to be associated with cancer
progression, poor prognosis, and recurrence after adjuvant

HSP110 suppression increased the sensitivity to 5-FU and
cisplatin in the human gastric cancer cell lines. Our results
suggest that nuclear HSP110 expression in gastric cancer
may be a new prognostic and drug sensitivity marker, and
HSP110 may serve as a new molecular therapeutic target

sites were blocked by incubating the sections with Protein
Block Serum-Free (DAKO, Carpinteria, CA, USA) for
30 min. A rabbit monoclonal anti-HSP110 antibody
(GeneTex, CA, USA) was applied at 1:100 dilution, for
24 h at 4°C. The primary antibody was visualized using
the Histofine Simple Stain MAX-PO (MULTI) (Nichirei,
Tokyo, Japan) according to the instruction manual. A
chromogen, 3,3-diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride, was
applied as a 0.02% solution containing 0.005% hydrogen
peroxide in 50 mM ammonium acetate-citrate acid buffer
(pH 6.0). The sections were lightly counterstained with
Mayer’s hematoxylin and mounted. The evaluation of
immunohistochemical staining was performed by two
independent researchers who were blinded to the patients’
data. We focused on nuclear HSP110 expression, and the
intensity of nuclear HSP110 staining was scored as follows:
0, no staining; 1+, weak staining; 2+, moderate staining;
3+, strong staining. Gastric cancer patients were assigned
to the nuclear HSP110 low expression group (0, 1+) or
high expression group (2+, 3+), according to staining
score (Figure 1C). Additionally, the tissues adjacent to
the cancerous tissues in the tissue microarray samples
were considered non-cancerous tissue. We evaluated the
expression of HSP110 in the non-cancerous tissue of these
10 samples, for validation. The non-cancerous tissue was
defined as the normal gastric mucosa tissue or stromal cells.

METHODS
Patients and samples
Primary gastric cancer tissues were obtained from
gastric cancer patients (n = 210; 147 men and 63 women)
who underwent radical gastrectomy at the Department of
General Surgical Science, Gunma University Hospital,
Japan, between January 1999 and May 2006. The stage of
gastric cancer was described according to the classification
of gastric carcinoma of the Japanese Gastric Cancer
Association’s 3rd English edition [38]. Forty-eight patients
received 5-FU-based adjuvant chemotherapy between
January 2003 and May 2006. The correlation between
HSP110 expression and clinicopathological factors and
prognosis was evaluated in these patients. Written informed
consents were obtained from all patients according to
institutional guidelines.

Tissue microarray analysis and
immunohistochemical staining

Cell culture
The human gastric cancer cell lines MKN7,
MKN45, MKN74, and AZ521 were used in this study.
These cell lines were obtained from RIKEN BRC through
the National Bio-Resource Project of MEXT, Tokyo,
Japan. The cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium
(Wako, Osaka, Japan) supplemented with 10% FBS and
1% penicillin-streptomycin (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA,
USA).

Tumor samples were fixed in formalin, embedded
in paraffin, and stored in the archives of the Clinical
Department of Pathology, Gunma University Hospital,
Japan. For 210 gastric cancer patients, one paraffin block
containing representative non-necrotic tumor areas was
selected, and gastric cancer tissue cores (2.0 mm diameter
per tumor) were sampled from the representative areas
and transferred into the paraffin block using a tissue
arraying instrument (Beecher Instruments, Silver Spring,
MD, USA). Cores were arranged into quad tissue array
blocks, with each containing 50–55 tumor cores. Tissue
microarray blocks were cut into 3.5-μm thick sections,
and were used for the subsequent immunohistochemical
staining. Additionally, 4-μm sections were cut from the
paraffin blocks of 10  gastric cancer samples, selected
among 210 gastric cancer patients for validation.
All sections were incubated at 60°C for 60 min
and deparaffinized in xylene. Afterward, these sections
were rehydrated and incubated with fresh 0.3%
hydrogen peroxide in 100% methanol for 30 min at room
temperature, in order to block endogenous peroxidase
activity. Following the rehydration through a graded
series of ethanol treatments, the sections were heated in
boiling water and soaked in Immunosaver (Nishin EM,
Tokyo, Japan) at 98°C for 90 min. Non-specific binding

siRNA transfection
HSP110-specific siRNA was purchased from Bonac
Corporation (Fukuoka, Japan). MKN7 and MKN45 cells
were plated at a density of 1.0 × 106 cells per well in 100 μl
of Opti-MEM I Reduced Serum Medium (Invitrogen,
Carlsbad, CA, USA). Twenty nM of HSP110-specific
siRNA 1, 2, 3 and scrambled siRNA (negative control)
were added to the cells, and cells were transfected with
siRNAs using an electroporator (CUY-21 EDIT II;
BEX, Tokyo, Japan), according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. Poring pulses were applied at 125 V (pulse
length, 10.0 ms; 1 pulse; interval, 40.0 ms), and transfer
pulses were applied at 10 V (pulse length, 50.0 ms;
5 pulses; interval, 50.0 ms). After 72 h of incubation,
further experiments were performed.

Western blotting was performed to confirm the
expression of HSP110 and β-actin in gastric cancer cell
lines. Transfected cells were incubated for 72 h, and total
proteins were extracted from MKN7, MKN45, MKN74,
and AZ521 cells using PRO-PREP Protein Extraction
Solution Kit (iNtRON Biotechnology, Sungnam, KyungkiDo, Korea). The proteins were separated on 4–12%
Bis-Tris Mini Gels (Life Technologies Corporation,
Carlsbad, CA, USA), and transferred to membranes
using an iBlot Dry Blotting System (Life Technologies
Corporation, Carlsbad, CA, USA). The membranes were
incubated overnight at 4°C with rabbit monoclonal antiHSP110 antibody (1:1000; GeneTex, CA, USA) and
anti-β-actin antibody (1:1000; Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis,
MO, USA). Following this, the membranes were incubated
with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit
secondary antibodies, and the target proteins were detected
with the ECL Prime Western Blotting Detection System
(GE Healthcare, Tokyo, Japan) using Image Quant
LAS4000 (GE Healthcare Life Sciences, UK).

100 μl of RPMI 1640 medium containing 20% FBS before
drug exposure. After 24 h of pre-incubation, 10 μl of Cell
Counting Kit-8 reagent were added, and the cells were
additionally incubated for 2 h at 37°C. The absorbance
of each well was detected at 450 nm using an xMark
Microplate Absorbance Spectrophotometer (Bio Rad,
Hercules, CA, USA). Afterward, the cells were treated
with various concentrations of cisplatin and 5-FU for 48 h.
Viability was determined using colorimetry by measuring
absorbance every 24 h.

of the 72,000-dalton heat shock protein in heat-shocked
mammalian cells. J Biol Chem. 1984; 259:4501–4513.

Data for continuous variables were expressed as
mean ± standard error of the mean. Significance was
determined using Student’s t-test and analysis of variance.
The statistical analysis of the immunohistochemical
staining results was performed using the chi-squared
test. Survival curves were generated according to the
Kaplan-Meier method and analyzed using the log-rank
test. Prognostic factors were examined by univariate and
multivariate analyses using a Cox proportional hazards
model. Results were considered statistically significant
when P value was < 0.05. All statistical analyses were
performed using JMP software, version 12 (SAS Institute
Inc., Cary, NC, USA).
