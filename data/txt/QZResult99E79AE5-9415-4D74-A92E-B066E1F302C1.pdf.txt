cancer stem cells

Substantial evidence suggests that breast cancer initiation, recurrence and drug resistance is supported by breast cancer stem cells
(BCSCs). Recently, we reported a novel role of Aurora kinase A (AURKA) in BCSCs, as a transactivating co-factor in the induction of
the c-Myc oncoprotein. However, the mode of action and transcriptional network of nuclear AURKA in BCSCs remain unknown.
Here, we report that nuclear AURKA can be recruited by Forkhead box subclass M1 (FOXM1) as a co-factor to transactivate FOXM1
target genes in a kinase-independent manner. In addition, we show that AURKA and FOXM1 participate in a tightly coupled positive
feedback loop to enhance BCSC phenotype. Indeed, kinase-dead AURKA can effectively transactivate the FOXM1 promoter through
a Forkhead response element, whereas FOXM1 can activate AURKA expression at the transcriptional level in a similar manner.
Consistently, breast cancer patient samples portrayed a strong and signiﬁcant correlation between the expression levels of FOXM1
and AURKA. Moreover, both FOXM1 and AURKA were essential for maintaining the BCSC population. Finally, we demonstrated that
the AURKA inhibitor AKI603 and FOXM1 inhibitor thiostrepton acted synergistically to inhibit cytoplasmic AURKA activity and
disrupt the nuclear AURKA/FOXM1-positive feedback loop, respectively, resulting in a more effective inhibition of the
tumorigenicity and self-renewal ability of BCSCs. Collectively, our study uncovers a previously unknown tightly coupled positive
feedback signalling loop between AURKA and FOXM1, crucial for BCSC self-renewal. Remarkably, our data reveal a novel potential
therapeutic strategy for targeting both the cytoplasmic and nuclear AURKA function to effectively eliminate BCSCs, so as to
overcome both breast cancer and drug resistance.

INTRODUCTION
Breast cancer is one of the principal causes of female mortality
worldwide.1 Although surgery coupled with adjuvant chemotherapy largely improves survival rates, there is still a
substantial portion of patients who are refractory to the present
chemotherapeutic strategies. Substantial recent evidence suggests that breast cancer progression, recurrence and drug
resistance are supported by the presence of breast cancer stem
cells (BCSCs).2 However, the molecular mechanisms that govern
self-renewal of BCSCs and drug resistance remain, to date, largely
elusive. Understanding how BCSCs acquire the ability to selfrenew and develop drug resistance will therefore greatly aid in
the design of novel therapies targeted at eliminating these
malignant cells.
Aurora kinases are highly conserved serine/threonine kinases.3
The canonical function of Aurora kinases is regulating centrosome
duplication and separation by promoting mitotic spindle
assembly.4 A large body of research indicates that Aurora kinase
A (AURKA) overexpresses in a variety of tumours and endows
them with uncontrolled mitosis.4,5 Consistent with previous

studies, along with others, we have uncovered that AURKA
dysregulation is associated with tumour metastasis and chemotherapeutic resistance. In agreement, AURKA inhibition can
suppress the proliferation of a diverse range of malignancies,
including nasopharyngeal carcinoma, acute myeloid leukaemia
and breast cancer.6–8 However, although these inhibitors exhibited a tolerable toxicity proﬁle and promising initial clinical
efﬁcacy, most failed to surpass the initial trials.9–12 Recently, we
showed that these failures are caused by the non-kinasedependent nuclear transactivating function that enhances cancer
stem cell properties that drive drug resistance.13 Nevertheless, the
complicated molecular regulatory network of nuclear AURKA still
needs to be further elucidated.
Forkhead box (FOX) superfamily of proteins are responsible for
the spatio-temporal regulation of a broad range of transcriptional
programmes critical for normal homeostasis and development.14
The FOX subclass M1 (FOXM1) transcription factor is a key factor in
cancer initiation, progression and drug resistance.15 We previously
reported that FOXM1 is a key downstream effector of the
PI3K-AKT, ATM/p53-E2F and p38-MAPK-MK2 signalling cascades

RESULTS
AURKA promotes FOXM1 expression and increases the BCSC
population
We previously showed that overexpression of AURKA was
responsible for drug resistance and predicted an inferior prognosis
in breast cancer.13 Here we revealed that AURKA overexpression
signiﬁcantly augmented the expression of FOXM1 and cancer
stem cell markers c-Myc and Nanog in breast cancer cells
(Figure 1a). We then examined whether AURKA participates in
regulation of BCSCs. Overexpression of AURKA signiﬁcantly
increased the CD44hi population and the mammosphere formation capacity in MCF-7 breast cancer cells (Figures 1b and c;
Supplementary Figure S1A). Consistently, AURKA knockdown

involved in chemotherapeutic drug sensitivity and resistance in
myriad of cancers,16–22 suggesting that FOXM1 could potentially
be a useful molecular biomarker and a therapeutic target for the
elimination of cancer stem cells.
Here we uncovered a previous unknown positive feedback loop
between AURKA and FOXM1 crucial for the acquisition of selfrenewal properties and drug resistance of BCSCs. We further
demonstrated that the AURKA and FOXM1 inhibitors can function
synergistically to inhibit AURKA activity and disrupt the positive
feedback loop to more effectively limit the tumorigenicity of
breast cancer cells. These new data propose a promising
therapeutic strategy to effectively target AURKA function to
eliminate BCSCs.

downregulated the expression of FOXM1 and that of the cancer
stem cell markers c-Myc, SOX2 and Nanog in MDA-MB-231 cells
(Figure 1d). Accordingly, knockdown of AURKA also reduced the
CD44hi/CD24lo sub-population and the mammosphere formation
capacity in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells (Figures 1e and f;
Supplementary Figure S1B).
Furthermore, we subcutaneously injected MDA-MB-231 cells
harbouring stably integrated inducible AURKA knockdown short
hairpin RNA (shRNA) constructs into nude mice and evaluated
their effects on tumour growth. In comparison with vehicle
(dimethylsulphoxide (DMSO))-treated control cells, which formed
large tumours, doxycycline (Dox)-induced cells displayed substantially reduced tumour growth (Figure 1g). In addition, immunohistochemistry revealed a reduction in AURKA, FOXM1 and Nanog
staining in Dox-treated tumours, compared with the DMSOtreated controls (Figure 1h). Finally, we performed limiting dilution
assays in NOD/SCID mice to evaluate effect of AURKA on stemness
in vivo. As shown in Table 1, AURKA knockdown reduced tumour
incidence, indicating that AURKA has an essential function in
tumour initiation.
FOXM1 contributes to AURKA-mediated BCSC expansion
To investigate if FOXM1 is indeed a key downstream target of
AURKA, we knocked down FOXM1 in Sum-149 cells that
overexpressed AURKA and examined the stemness of BCSCs.
The results showed that the positive effects of AURKA on the
CD44hi/CD24lo cell population and mammosphere formation
were signiﬁcantly impaired by FOXM1 depletion (Figures 2a–c).
Next, we overexpressed FOXM1 and examined the stemness of
BCSCs. The result showed that FOXM1 overexpression signiﬁcantly increased the expression levels of AURKA as well as
cancer stem cell markers c-Myc and Nanog, in MCF-7 cells

(Figure 2d). Furthermore, overexpression of FOXM1 also signiﬁcantly increased the CD44hi fraction and the mammosphere
formation capacity in MCF-7 cells (Figures 2e and f), whereas
FOXM1 knockdown in MDA-MB-231 cells had the opposite
effects (Supplementary Figure S2). Consistently, FOXM1 knockdown downregulated the expression levels of cancer stem cell
markers SOX2, c-Myc and Nanog, and reduced the mammosphere formation capacity and the CD44hi/CD24lo population in
MDA-MB-231 cells (Figures 2g–i).
Furthermore, we subcutaneously injected MDA-MB-231 cells
harbouring stably integrated inducible FOXM1 knockdown shRNA
constructs into nude mice to evaluate their effects on tumour
growth. In contrast to vehicle (DMSO)-treated control cells, which
formed large tumours, Dox-induced cells gave rise to greatly
reduced tumours (Figure 2j). Futhermore, immunohistochemical
staining revealed decreased levels of FOXM1, AURKA and Nanog
expression in Dox-induced tumours, compared with the
control DMSO-treated cells (Figure 2k). Finally, we performed
limiting dilution assays in NOD/SCID mice to evaluate effect of
FOXM1 on stemness in vivo. As shown in Table 1, FOXM1
knockdown reduced tumour incidence, indicating that FOXM1 has
a key role in tumour initiation. Collectively, these data implied that
AURKA increases the proportion of BCSCs by positively
regulating FOXM1.
AURKA transcriptionally activates FOXM1 expression in kinaseindependent manner
Given that both AURKA and FOXM1 are cell cycle regulatory genes
involved in G2/M phase transition,4,23 we therefore evaluated
whether the canonical kinase activity of AURKA is essential for
FOXM1 activation. Interestingly, both the AURKA-activated form
(T288D) and the kinase-defective form (D274N) could promote
FOXM1 expression (Figure 3a), suggesting that AURKA activates
FOXM1 expression in a kinase-independent manner. To conﬁrm
this result, we inhibited AURKA kinase activity with the small
molecule kinase inhibitors VX680 and MLN8237, respectively, and
then studied the expression of FOXM1. As shown in Figure 3b, the
expression of FOXM1 was signiﬁcantly increased in AURKA
overexpressed cells, although the active phosphorylated form of
AURKA (P-AURKA) was hardly detectable. These results suggest
that AURKA can activate FOXM1 expression independent of its
kinase activity.
FOXM1 expression could be regulated at the transcriptional and
post-transcriptional levels.24 We next examined the levels of
FOXM1 mRNA in MCF-7 cells after AURKA overexpression or
depletion. The results showed that the FOXM1 mRNA levels
signiﬁcantly increased when AURKA was overexpressed, and
signiﬁcantly decreased with AURKA knocked down (Figures 3c
and d). In concordance, a similar phenomenon was observed
in another breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231 (Supplementary
Figure S3). Furthermore, the luciferase reporter assay also showed
that the AURKA wild-type (WT), kinase-activated form (T288D)
and kinase-defective form (D274N) could all effectively

criptionally activate FOXM1 expression independent of its
kinase function.

transactivate FOXM1 expression through recruiting the FOXM1
protein.
To conﬁrm further the interaction between AURKA and FOXM1,
we performed confocal microscopy and co-immunoprecipitation
(co-IP) assays. The results suggested that AURKA and FOXM1
colocalise in the nucleus and interact with each other (Figures 4d
and e; Supplementary Figure S4). We further conﬁrmed that
AURKA and FOXM1 co-occupy the FOXM1 gene promoter using
ChIP Re-ChIP assay. The result suggested that AURKA complexes
with FOXM1 on the FHRE of the FOXM1 promoter (Figure 4f).
Taken together, these results clearly show that FOXM1 recruits
nuclear AURKA to directly transactivate FOXM1 transcription.

Nuclear AURKA binds directly to FOXM1 promoter to transactivate
its expression
Next, we performed a promoter truncation assay to locate the
AURKA responsive region in the FOXM1 promoter. The result
showed that the transactivation effect was lost when +1/+300
region was deleted (Figure 4a). Interestingly, transcription factorbinding sites analysis indicated that a consensus Forkheadresponsive element (FHRE) locates in this region, suggesting that
AURKA may regulate FOXM1 expression through targeting
FOXM1 directly. Previous studies have reported that FOXM1
could bind its own promoter and transactivate its own
expression. As AURKA cannot directly bind gene promoters, we
hypothesised that AURKA activates FOXM1 promoter through
binding to FOXM1. To test this conjecture, we assessed the
ability of AURKA to transactivate the FOXM1 promoter with and
without FOXM1 depletion. As revealed in Figure 4b, the ability of
AURKA to enhance FOXM1 promoter activity was lost in the
absence of FOXM1, suggesting that AURKA induces FOXM1
expression via recruiting FOXM1. To corroborate this result, two
types of point mutations were introduced into the FHRE of the
FOXM1 promoter to disrupt FOXM1 binding. The luciferase
reporter assay showed that AURKA lost its FOXM1 promoter
activation effect while this motif was mutated (Figure 4c).
Collectively, these results strongly suggested that AURKA can

FOXM1 directly activates AURKA expression at the transcriptional
level
As shown in Figures 2d and g, AURKA showed a similar expression
pattern as FOXM1 after we overexpressed or depleted FOXM1,
suggesting that AURKA is regulated by FOXM1. We therefore
analysed the recruitment of FOXM1 to the AURKA promoter using
the published FOXM1 ChIP-seq data25 and ENCODE UCSC genome
browser.26,27 As shown in Figure 5a, FOXM1 binding was detected
as a strong peak at the promoter region of AURKA, indicating that
AURKA expression is directly regulated by FOXM1 at the promoter
level. Next, we investigated the AURKA mRNA levels in FOXM1
overexpression and silencing cells, and observed that AURKA
mRNA and protein levels signiﬁcantly changed with FOXM1
expression (Figure 5b; Supplementary Figure S5). We then
performed a promoter truncation analysis to locate the FOXM1

by reverse transcriptase (RT)–quantitative PCR (qPCR) using primers recognising the FHRE region (ChIP-1) and control primers (ChIP-ctrl-1) (4A)

responsive region in the AURKA promoter. The data indicated that
the transactivational effect of FOXM1 was diminished when the
FHRE-containing region (−806/ − 28) was deleted (Figure 5c). To
conﬁrm this result, a mutation was introduced into the putative
FHRE to disrupt FOXM1 binding. Indeed, FOXM1 lost its ability to
transactivate the AURKA promoter when the FHRE was mutated
(Figure 5d). To conﬁrm whether AURKA promoter was a direct

FOXM1 target, we performed ChIP analysis in MDA-MB-231 cells
and observed strong FOXM1 binding at the promoter region
containing the FHRE but not in the control promoter, an
upstream site, which lacks a FHRE, or in the IgG-negative control
(Figure 5e). These data suggested that FOXM1 binds directly
to AURKA promoter to activate AURKA expression at the
transcriptional level.

indicated a strong and signiﬁcantly positive correlation between
the expression levels of AURKA and FOXM1 mRNA (Pearson

cancer patients. Interestingly, patients with high levels of AURKA
and FOXM1 had signiﬁcantly poorer OS outcomes when
compared to those with high expression of AURKA or FOXM1
alone (Figure 6e).
Furthermore, we performed limiting dilution assays in NOD/
SCID mice to compare the effect of AURKA and FOXM1 on
stemness in vivo. As shown in Table 1, both knocking down of
AURKA and FOXM1 could reduce tumour initiation ability of breast
cancer cells.

AKI603 and thiostrepton synergistically inhibit the proliferation of
BCSCs
Most of AURKA kinase inhibitors failed in the initial phases of
clinical trials; however, very little is known about drug resistance
mechanisms for these inhibitors. Recently, this drug failure has
been proposed to be caused by the non-kinase dependent
transactivating function of nuclear AURKA.13 Our present ﬁndings
propose that nuclear AURKA drives a FOXM1 activation-mediated
positive feedback loop that promotes the tumorigenicity and

FOXM1 and AURKA co-regulate breast cancer stem cells

3437
self-renewal of BCSCs and suggest that combined inhibition of
AURKA and FOXM1 may effectively block the feedback loop
and simultaneously inhibit the kinase and non-kinase function
of AURKA (Figure 7a). To test this conjecture, we studied
the ability of the novel AURKA inhibitor AKI6038 and the
established FOXM1 inhibitor thiostrepton30 to function together
in repressing the proliferation of MDA-MB-231 cell. To this end,
proliferative analysis was performed to evaluate the potential
synergistic interactions between AKI603 and thiostrepton in a
ﬁxed ratio (1:20). The results showed that the combinational
treatment resulted in a more potent growth inhibition of MDAMB-231 cells than that with the single drug alone (Figure 7b).
These data were then subjected to combination index (CI)
analysis.31 As shown in Figure 7c, the result revealed that
AKI603 and thiostrepton acted synergistically to inhibit MDAMB-231 cell proliferation.
We next investigated if the AURKA and FOXM1 inhibitors also
act synergistically to suppress proliferation and self-renewal of
BCSC. The combinational treatment exerted a greater suppression
on colony formation compared with single agents alone
(Figure 7d). Moreover, we gauged the effects of combining
AKI603 and thiostrepton on mammosphere formation using MDAMB-231 cells. As shown in Figure 7e, AKI603 alone (P o 0.001) or
thiostrepton alone (P o 0.001) moderately reduced mammosphere
number and size compared with the control, whereas the
combinational treatment signiﬁcantly reduced mammosphere
number and size.
Finally, we evaluated the in vivo anticancer effects of AURKA
and FOXM1 inhibitors in a xenograft model. Nude mice habouring
MDA-MB-231 xenograft tumours were subjected to AKI603,
thiostrepton, or the combination every day by intragastric
administration for 14 days. As shown in Figure 7f, tumour volumes
in the combinational treatment group were signiﬁcantly smaller
than those in the single drug groups and the control group. Taken
together, these results indicated that AURKA inhibitor AKI603 and
FOXM1 inhibitor thiostrepton synergistically inhibit the growth
of BCSCs.
DISCUSSION
AURKA is one of the three highly conserved serine/threonine
Aurora kinases (AURKA, -B and -C). It was originally identiﬁed as
a mitotic kinase, which has essential roles in control of
centrosome maturation/separation, bipolar spindle formation
and G2/M progression to ensure the ﬁdelity of mitosis.4 The
role of AURKA in cancer is underscored by the fact that it
is ampliﬁed and overexpressed in a multitude of human
tumour types.32 In breast cancer, AURKA is ampliﬁed in about
12% of all primary tumours32 and its mRNA overexpressed in
62% of breast carcinomas.33 In addition, overexpression of
AURKA is also observed in 94% of invasive ductal adenocarcinomas of the breast.34
Tumours are histologically heterogeneous, with different subpopulations of cancer cells exhibiting distinct molecular proﬁles
and phenotypes.35 Although chemotherapy can eliminate most
cells in a tumour, cancer stem cells survive and contribute to
tumour drug resistance, recurrence and repopulation.36 This study
supports a new role for AURKA in promoting cancer stem cell-like
properties and anticancer chemotherapeutic drug resistance.8,13
Accordingly, nuclear AURKA possesses stem cell-like characteristics, including enhanced mammosphere-forming ability,
sub-population of CD44lo/CD24hi breast cancer cells in vitro and
self-renewal capacity in in vivo models.8,13 In agreement, a recent
study has also identiﬁed AURKA as a crucial transcriptional target
of the pluripotency factor Nanog in embryonic and cancer
stem cells.37
In here, we further uncover a positive feedback signalling loop
between AURKA and FOXM1 essential for BCSC self-renewal and

show that AURKA is recruited to the proximal FOXM1 promoter
by FOXM1 itself to function as a co-activator to enhance FOXM1
transcription. Interestingly, the kinase activity of AURKA is not
involved in this nuclear function of AURKA. In concordance, we
have previously shown that AURKA contains three putative nine
amino-acid transactivation domains and is capable of promoting
gene expression as a transcription factor through participating in
assembling RNA polymerase II transcription machinery.13 A DNAbinding domain of AURKA has not been identiﬁed, and it is likely
that AURKA does not bind to target genes directly and is recruited
by transcription factors, such as FOXM1, to target genes to
modulate transcription.13
Given the importance of AURKA in promoting tumorigenesis
and cancer stem cell phenotypes, it is not surprising that about
30 Aurora kinase inhibitors are currently at different stages
of pre-clinical and clinical development, and these AURKA
inhibitors include MLN8237, CCT129202 and AT9283.9,12,38–40
However, a substantial number of AURKA inhibitors, such as
MK-0457 (also called VX680, Vertex/Merck), AZD 1152 (Astra
Zeneca), PHA 680632 (Nerviano), SU6668 (Sugen/Pﬁzer) and
R763 (Merck/Serono), have failed, despite being considered
successful in pre-clinical tests, suggesting that the mechanism of
action for AURKA in cancer cells is more complex than our
current understanding. Hitherto, the mechanism of resistance to
AURKA inhibitors have not been identiﬁed, although some
studies have advocated that mutations in the targeted kinase
domain of Aurora kinase and the overexpression of drug
resistance genes may be involved.41 Consistent with previous
ﬁndings,13 we have showed here and also previously that the
failure of some of these kinase inhibitors for AURKA may be
caused by the non-kinase dependent transactivating function of
AURKA in the nucleus that enhances the cancer stem cell
properties. In agreement with this notion, AURKA nuclear
staining has previously been reported in malignant tissues,
and importantly, has been a predictor of poor clinical
outcome.42–44
In the current work, we demonstrate that the FOXM1 inhibitor
thiostrepton30 is particularly effective in combining with AURKA
inhibitors to limit the tumorigenicity and self-renewal of BCSCs
by synergistically suppressing the AURKA activity and disrupting
the nuclear AURKA-FOXM1-positive feedback loop. This represents a promising therapeutic strategy for targeting both the
kinase and non-kinase functions of AURKA to eliminate BCSCs.
Besides that, our study also offers insights into the mechanism
of action of nuclear AURKA as well as its downstream
transcriptional network. Nevertheless, to devise better chemotherapeutic strategies to target AURKA to eliminate cancer
stem cells, a comprehensive understanding of the nuclear
AURKA molecular network and nucleus translocation mechanism is required.
In summary, our work has uncovered a previous unknown
positive feedback loop between AURKA and FOXM1 that
promotes BCSC phenotypes and drug resistance. We showed
here that nuclear AURKA is recruited by FOXM1 to transactivate
the expression of target genes, which also include FOXM1,
whereas AURKA itself is also a downstream transcriptional target
of FOXM1. This work further supports the novel non-canonical role
of AURKA as a transcription factor as well as a promoter of the
tumorigenicity and self-renewal of BCSCs. Crucially, we demonstrated that the AURKA inhibitor AKI603 and the FOXM1 inhibitor
thiostrepton can effectively inhibit the tumorigenicity and selfrenewal of BCSCs through synergistically inhibiting the AURKA
activity and disrupting the positive feedback loop mediated by the
non-kinase function of nuclear AURKA. These ﬁndings suggest a
viable and novel therapeutic strategy to effectively inhibit the
cytoplasmic and nuclear AURKA functions to eliminate BCSCs and
to overcome AURKA inhibitor resistance.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell lines and tissue culture conditions
Human breast cancer cell lines MDA-MB-231, SUM-149, MCF-7 and
MCF-10 A were acquired from the American Type Culture Collection
(Beijing Zhongyuan Ltd., Beijing, China), and cultured in media as
recommended by the provider. Epirubicin-resistant MCF-7 (MCF-7-EpiR)
cells have been described previously.45–47 MCF-7-EpiR cells were
cultured in Dulbecco’s modiﬁed Eagle’s medium (Gibco, ThermoFisher
Scientiﬁc, Shatin, Hong Kong) supplemented with 10% foetal bovine
serum (Hyclone, ThermoFisher Scientiﬁc, Beijing, China). All of these cell
lines were authenticated by the standard short tandem repeat DNA
typing.
Tissue samples. All clinical specimens were derived from breast cancer
patients from Sun Yat-Sen University Cancer Center, Guangzhou, China,
with patients’ consent and approval from the Sun Yat-Sen University
Cancer Center Institute Research Ethics Committee.
Plasmids and transfection. Complementary DNA encoding human AURKA
(WT) and human FOXM1 were generated by PCR ampliﬁcation and
subcloned into the pBabe-puro vector (Invitrogen, Beijing, China) for
expression studies. AURKA mutant constructs were generated using the
Quick Change Site directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, ThermoFisher
Scientiﬁc) according to the manufacturer’s protocols. Plasmids were
transfected into cells using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) following the
manufacturer’s instructions. The primers used are shown in Supplementary
Table S2.
Gene knockdown using shRNA. Gene silencing was performed using
speciﬁc shRNAs delivered by a lentiviral system acquired from SigmaAldrich (Shanghai, China), following the instructions provided. Brieﬂy, to
yield lentiviruses containing speciﬁc shRNA sequences, 293T cells were cotransfected with 2.5 μg pMD2.G and 7.5 μg psPAX2 packaging plasmids
and 10 μg of the pLKO.1 plasmid containing the speciﬁc shRNA for 24 h.
The lentivirus containing cultured medium was collected and stored at
− 80 ℃ as aliquots until further use. To deliver the speciﬁc shRNA
construct, approximately 10% conﬂuent cells were incubated with the
lentivirus bearing speciﬁc shRNA in growth medium containing 8 mg/ml
polybrene at 37℃ for 24 h. The transduced cells were then selected with
2 mg/ml puromycin. All shRNA constructs used are shown in
Supplementary Table S2.
Real-time RT–PCR. Total RNA was extracted using TRIzol reagent
(Invitrogen), and used for generating cDNA using SuperScript III RT
(Invitrogen) in the presence of oligo-dT primers. Real-time reverse
transcriptase–PCR was performed using Platinum SYBRGreen qPCR SuperMix (Invitrogen), with glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase as the
internal control. The primers used are listed in Table 1.
CD24 and CD44 expression analysis. Cells were harvested and incubated
with anti-human CD24 phycoerythrin (eBioscience, Gene Company Ltd,
Shanghai, China) and anti-human CD44-FITC (eBioscience, Gene
Company Ltd) at 4 1C. The cells were then resuspended in 1 ml of
phosphate-buffered saline and analysed using a FACScan cytometer
(Beckon Dickinson, Oxford, UK).
Immunoﬂuorescence staining. Cells were ﬁxed in 2% paraformaldehyde at
room temperature for 20 min and permeabilised in 0.5% Triton X-100 in
phosphate-buffered saline for 10 min. Slides were then incubated with the
primary antibody for 60 min. The antibodies used were anti-AURKA
antibody (ab13824, Abcam, Hangzhou, China, 1:200 dilution), anti-FOXM1
antibody (sc502, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Shanghai, China, 1:500
dilution). The secondary antibodies were conjugated to either Alexa-488
or Alexa-546 (Molecular Probes, Invitrogen, 1:200 dilution). Nuclei were
stained with DAPI (Sigma-Aldrich) and visualised with a Leica TCS SP5
confocal microscope (Leica Microsystems, Mannhein, Germany) equipped
with a 63x oil immersion objective and the LAS-AF software (Santa Cruz
Biotechnology).
Western blot analysis. Cells were lysed in RIPA (radioimmunoprecipitation assay) buffer and the protein concentrations determined by the
Bradford assay. Equal amounts of cell extracts were subjects to
electrophoresis on sodium dodecyl sulphate–polyacrylamide gel and
blotted onto nitrocellulose membrane (Millipore, Merck, Shanghai,
Oncogene (2017) 3428 – 3440

China). After protein transfer, the membranes were blocked and then
incubated with glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (Ambion,
ThermoFisher Scientiﬁc), β-actin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Gene
Company Ltd), p-AURKA (Thr288; Cell Signaling Technology, Gene
Company Ltd), AURKA (Upstate, Gene Company Ltd), HA-tag (Sigma),
c-Myc (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), SOX2 (Epitomics, Abcam, Hang Zhou,
China) and Nanog (Epitomics, Abcam) primary antibodies at 4 ℃
overnight. The membranes were then incubated for 1 h at room
temperature with the appropriate secondary antibodies. Proteins were
detected with an enhanced chemiluminescence kit (Pierce, ThermoFisher
Scientiﬁc).
Mammosphere formation assay. Mammosphere formation analyses were
performed as described previously.13 See Supplementary Materials and
Methods for details.
Luciferase reporter assay. Cells plated at a density of 1 × 105 per
well in 24-well plates overnight were transfected with a FOXM1 or
AURKA promoter-driven luciferase construct or the control luciferase
construct using Lipofectamine 2000. Twenty-four hours after
transfection, cells were collected and Fireﬂy and Renilla luciferase
activities measured using a dual luciferase kit (Promega, Beijing, China).
Fireﬂy luciferase data for each sample were normalised against Renilla
activity.
Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP). ChIP assays were carried out
according to the manufacturer’s protocol (EZ-Magna ChIP kit, Millipore,
Merck). AURKA and FOXM1 antibodies mentioned were used for ChIP
analysis. For sequential ChIP (Re-ChIP), the ﬁrst elute immunoprecipitated by anti-AURKA was further immunoprecipitated with either
anti-FOXM1 or IgG antibodies. The percentage of chromatin-bound
recovered DNA was quantiﬁed against DNA input. Primers used for
the ampliﬁcation of the precipitated DNA are listed in Supplementary
Table S2.
CI calculation. Data acquired from the cell viability assay were used to
calculate the CI. The CI was analysed with the CompuSyn software
(CompuSyn, Paramus, NJ, USA) using the average fraction of cells that
responded to each drug. CI values of o 0.8, between 0.8 and 1.2, and
41.2 were deﬁned as synergistic, additive and antagonistic,
respectively.48
Immunohistochemical staining and statistical analysis. Following informed
consent and in accordance with the guidelines of the Institutional Review
Boards, breast cancer specimens were collected, with informed consent
and in accordance with the guidelines of the Institutional Review Boards,
from patients undergoing surgery at the Third Afﬁliated Hospital of Sun
Yat-Sen University, China. Parafﬁn-embedded tissue blocks were
sectioned for immunohistochemistry as described previously.13 The
deparafﬁnised sections were incubated in H2O2 (3%) for 10 min, blocked
in 1% bovine serum albumin for 60 min and incubated with an antiAURKA antibody (1:400 dilution) or an anti-FOXM1 antibody (1:100
dilution) at 4 1C overnight. See Supplementary Materials and methods
for details.
Tumour growth in xenografts. Animal work was performed with approval
from the local Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (Sun Yat-Sen
University Cancer Center). MDA-MB-231 cells were treated with 200 ng/ml
Dox for 7 days, and 5 × 105 cells injected into the right ﬂank of 4-week-old
female nude mice (n = 9) as described previously.13 See Supplementary
Materials and Methods for details.
In vivo tumour initiation assay. To evaluate effect of AURKA and FOXM1
on stemness, limiting dilution assays were performed in NOD/SCID mice.
Cells were treated with 200 ng/ml Dox for 1 week, and injected
subcutaneously into NOD/SCID mice at concentrations of 5 × 105, 1 × 105,
1 × 104 and 1 × 103cells per site. Eight mice were used in each experimental
group. Tumour formation was checked every 4 days and the observation
time was 8 weeks in total.

Statistical analysis
Statistical analyses were performed using the SPSS software, version 16.0
(SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) and with GraphPad Prism 5.0 (GraphPad

FOXM1 and AURKA co-regulate breast cancer stem cells

Software, Inc., LaJolla, CA, USA). Kruskal–Wallis test, followed by a Dunn
multiple comparison test, was used to compare mammosphere size
distributions. The unpaired Student's t-test was used to perform statistical
analysis between two groups. The analysis of variance test and the least
signiﬁcant difference test were used for conducting multiple comparisons.
The level of signiﬁcance was set at Po 0.05
