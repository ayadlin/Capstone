ABSTRACT
Inhibition of proteasome-associated deubiquitinases (DUBs) is emerging as a
novel strategy for cancer therapy. It was recently reported that auranofin (Aur),
a gold (I)-containing compound used clinically to treat rheumatoid arthritis, is a
proteasome-associated DUB inhibitor. Disulfiram (DSF), an inhibitor of aldehyde
dehydrogenase, is currently in clinical use for treating alcoholism. Recent studies
have indicated that DSF can also act as an antitumor agent. We investigated the effect
of combining DSF and Aur on apoptosis induction and tumor growth in hepatoma
cancer cells. Here we report that (i) the combined treatment of Aur and DSF results
in synergistic cytotoxicity to hepatoma cells in vitro and in vivo; (ii) Aur and DSF
in combination induces caspase activation, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, and
reactive oxygen species (ROS) production; (iii) pan-caspase inhibitor z-VAD-FMK
could efficiently block apoptosis but not proteasome inhibition induced by Aur and
DSF combined treatment, and ROS is not required for Aur+DSF to induce apoptosis.
Collectively, we demonstrate a model of synergism between DSF and proteasomeassociated DUB inhibitor Aur in the induction of apoptosis in hepatoma cancer cells,
identifying a potential novel anticancer strategy for clinical use in the future.

INTRODUTION

Recently, a strategy based on inhibition of
proteasome-associated deubiquitinases (DUBs) has
emerged as a promising anti-cancer therapy [4–6].
In eukaryotes, DUBs remove the ubiquitin (Ub) and
ubiquitin-like (Ubl) chain from target proteins prior to their
degradation and thereby are involved in regulating multiple
cellular processes, including cell cycle control [7, 8],
DNA damage response and repair [9–11], chromatin
modification [12], and various signal transduction
pathways [13]. The human genome is found to encode
approximately 100 putative DUBs, which are subdivided
into six families according to their catalytic and structural
features. Among these DUBs, POH1, UCHL5 and USP14

Cancer cells have been shown to depend on the
ubiquitin proteasome system (UPS) more than normal
cells. The successful application of 20S proteasome
peptidases inhibitor, bortezomib, approved by the
United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for
multiple myeloma treatment, established a therapeutic
target based on UPS [1]. Unfortunately, the same as other
chemotherapeutic agents, drug resistance has become
an increasing concern and limits the administration of
bortezomib [2, 3]. Therefore, alternative therapeutic
strategies are required for cancer treatment.

are associated with the 19S proteasome; they are often
overexpressed in several carcinoma cells, which renders
them potentially new therapeutic targets in these cancer
cells [14–17].
Auranofin (Aur), a gold (I)-containing agent, is
clinically used to treat rheumatic arthritis for more than
30 years. Recent studies have demonstrated that Aur has
potent antitumor effects beyond its anti-inflammatory
activity [18, 19]; therefore, it has been approved by
FDA for Phase II clinical trial in cancer therapy (http://
clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/ NCT01419691). Several
potential mechanisms were proposed for the anti-cancer
effects of Aur, including inhibition of thioredoxin
reductase (TrxR), over generation of reactive oxygen
species (ROS), loss of mitochondrial membrane
potential (MMP), and induction of endoplasmic
reticulum (ER) stress and caspase activation [20–22].
However, we have recently unraveled that Aur inhibits
19S proteasome-associated DUBs (mainly UCHL5 and
USP14), accumulates ubiquitinated proteins (Ub-prs),
and induces unfolded protein response (UPR) followed
by cell apoptosis. Additionally, our previous studies have
suggested that Aur can stimulate cellular ROS generation
but this is not required for Aur to induce apoptosis
[23–25].
Disulfiram (DSF) is currently in clinical use for
the treatment of alcoholism by irreversibly inhibiting
aldehyde dehydrogenase. Several studies have shown that
DSF possesses an anticancer activity in various cancer
cells [26–28]. In addition, it was reported that DSF, as a
cooper-binding agent, induced apoptosis in breast cancer
via proteasome inhibition [29]. It was also reported
that DSF, when complexed with copper, could induce
ROS-dependent apoptosis of prostate cancer cells [30].
Moreover, it was reported that DSF and its metabolites
could be used as a chemosensitizer of some anti-cancer
agents [31].
Here we report that the combination of Aur and
DSF synergistically enhances their cytotoxicity and cell
apoptosis of hepatoma cancer cells in both cultures and
xenograft models and the synergistic effect is associated
with enhancement of proteasome inhibition, induction of
ER stress, loss of MMP, and caspase activation.

the cell viability but a dramatic decrease of viability
was induced by the co-treatment at each concentration
(Figure 1A and 1B). The combination indices of the
treatment of 10 μM DSF combined with 0.05, 0.1, or
0.2 μM Aur in hepatocarcinoma HepG2 and SMMC7721cells were 0.183, 0.212, or 0.321 and 0.269, 0.362,
or 0.293, respectively (Figure 1C and 1D). The uniformly
low combination indices (all < 0.5) further demonstrate
the strong synergistic inhibition of cell viability. In order
to test the long-term effect of DSF plus Aur co-treatment
on cancer cells, we measured colony formation of SMMC7721 and HepG2 cells in soft agar. As shown in Figure 1E,
the co-treatment resulted in fewer colonies than the singledrug treatments after 7 days culture.

DSF enhanced Aur-induced cell death
To investigate whether DSF and/or Aur induced cell
viability inhibition correlates with cell death, HepG2 and
SMMC-7721 were exposed to either DSF (10 μM), Aur
(0.2 μM) or their combination for 24 h. Cell death was
detected using Annexin-V FITC and propidium iodide (PI)
staining followed by flow cytometry and using PI staining
followed by fluorescent microscopy in living cells. The
flow cytometry study revealed that in both HepG2 and
SMMC-7721 cells, less than 10% cell death was induced
by either DSF or Aur respectively, while almost 40% (in
HepG2) and 60%~70% (in SMMC-7721) of cell death
were induced by the co-treatment for 24 h (Figure 2A, 2B
and 2C). The fluorescence microscopy showed that few
PI-positive cells were induced by DSF or Aur alone but
a significantly high percentage of PI-positive cells were
induced by the DSF and Aur combined treatment (Figure
2D), indicating that the treatment with a combination of
DSF and Aur significantly enhances cell death in hepatoma
cancer cells.

Induction of apptosis by DSF+Aur co-treatment
is associated with caspase activation, decreased
expression of anti-apoptotic proteins and
increased expression of pro-apoptotic proteins
We and others have reported that Aur, a clinically
used anti-rheumatic agent, inhibits 19S DUBs and induces
apoptosis associated with caspase activation and loss of
MMP in various cancer cells [23]. Here, we investigated
whether caspases and mitochondria associated signaling
pathways were involved in the induction of apoptosis by
the DSF and Aur combined treatment. It was found that
the combination of DSF and Aur dramatically activated
caspase-3,-8 and -9 and increased the cleavage of PARP
(Figure 3A). It is widely accepted that mitochondria are
the regulating center of apoptosis. As shown in Figure
3B and 3C, the integrity of mitochondrial membranes
was decreased in both SMMC-7721 and HepG2 cells
after co-treatment with DSF and Aur. The release of
cytochrome C and apoptosis inducing factor (AIF) from

RESULTS
Aur and DSF synergistically inhibit cell
proliferation and colony formation of both
SMMC-7721 and HepG2 cells
To determine whether DSF sensitizes cancer cells
to Aur treatment, we first tested the effect of various
concentrations of DSF (5, 10, 20, 40 μM) or Aur (0.05,
0.1, 0.2 μM) alone or in combination on the cell viability
of human hepatocarcinoma HepG2 and SMMC-7721
cells using the MTS assay. We found that treatment with
either DSF or Aur alone for 48 h only slightly reduced

mitochondria to the cytoplasm has been recognized as the
early stage of apoptosis. To determine whether DSF+Aur
co-treatment triggers the mitochondrial pathway, cancer
cells were exposed to Aur, DSF and their combination
for 12 hours. Cytosolic and mitochondrial fractions were
extracted and the cytochrome C and AIF levels were
detected by western blot analyses. As shown in Figure 3D,

cytochrome C and AIF levels were highly elevated in
the cytoplasm after DSF+Aur treatment, which indicates
that DSF+Aur could activate the mitochondrial apoptosis
pathway. Further supporting this observation, DSF and
Aur synergistically decreased anti-apoptotic proteins
Bcl-2 and Bcl-xl, and increased pro-apoptotic proteins
Bim and Noxa.

activation, is critical to the induction of cell death by the
combined treatment.

The induction of caspase activation and PARP
cleavage synergistically by Aur and
DSF can be reversed by z-VAD-FMK and
N-acetyl-cysteine (NAC)

ROS generation is increased by Aur-DSF
co-treatment but it is not required for the
co-treatment to induce cell death
It had been reported that Aur could induce ROS
generation in various cancer cells by inhibiting TrxR and
the ROS generation was thought to be responsible for cell
death Induction by Aur. However, we previously observed
that Tbhq could completely scavenge Aur-mediated ROS
production but could not block Ub-prs accumulation and
cytotoxicity [23]. Likewise, here we found that DSF and
Aur synergistically enhanced ROS production (Figure 6A),
which was blocked by using another antioxidant agent,
Vitamin C (100 μM; Figure 6B); however, similarly to our
prior report, the scavenging of ROS by Vitamin C failed
to block cell death (Figure 6C), Ub-prs accumulation, or
PARP cleavage (Figure 6D) induced by the DSF and Aur

In the experiments shown Figure 5, we observed
in both HepG2 and SMMC-7721 cells that both pancaspase inhibitor Z-VAD-FMK and the Aur active site
blocker NAC almost completely blocked the activation
of caspase-3,-8 and -9 and the cleavage of PARP; and
NAC but not Z-VAD-FMK blocked Ub-prs accumulation
(Figure 5A). Additionally, both Z-VAD-FMK and NAC
prevented Aur+DSF co-treatment from inducing cell
death (Figure 5B and 5C). These findings are consistent
with the proteasome inhibition effects of Aur observed
in our previous reports [23]. Taken together, these results
demonstrate that Ub-prs accumulation, prior to caspase

co-treatment. These findings further confirm that DSF
and Aur combination induces apoptosis through DUB
inhibition, not by ROS generation.

We found that tumor weight and tumor size of nude
mouse models in the combinational treatment group were
significantly reduced, compared with each single-agent
treatment group (Figure 7A and 7B), while there were
no significant differences in body weight among four
groups (Figure 7C). The immunostaining results showed
that the representative proteasome substrates, Ub-prs,
and activated caspase-3 proteins were all significantly
increased (Figure 7D) in the DSF and Aur combination
-treated tumors. Similarly to the immunostaining results,
western blot results showed that treatment with the DSF
and Aur combination significantly increased the levels

Aur and DSF combination exhibits anti-cancer
activity in vivo
Given that our in-vitro experiments show a
promising synergisticanti-cancer activity by DSF and
Aur on human hepatoma cell lines HepG2 and SMMC7721, we next evaluated the in vivo effect of DSF and
Aur combination using nude mouse xenograft models.

as Bim and Noxa, followed by the loss of mitochondria
membrane potential (∆Ψ) and thus activation of caspase-9.
In addition, we further confirmed that the combination of
DSF and Aur induced proteasome inhibition and increased
the expression of HSP70 and HSP90 and a series of ER
stress associated proteins such as Bip, CHOP, IRE1α,
ATF4, and P-eIF2α. The unfolded protein response (UPR)
is the cellular response to ER stress and contributes to
cancer survival or death [33]. Generally, GRP78/Bip binds
to PERK and leads to the phosphorylation of eIF2α  on
serine residue 51, which inhibits the translation of mRNA
[34], and paradoxically increases translation of ATF4 [35].
On one hand, ATF4 regulates transcription of pro-survival
genes; on the other hand, ATF4 upregulates the expression
of pro-death transcription factor C/EBP homology protein
(CHOP) [33, 36]. Based on our data, we hypothesize that
there might be another pathway involved in the induction
of apoptosis by the combined treatment: the DSF and Aur
combination first cause proteasome inhibition, which then
leads to accumulation of damaged and unfolded proteins
in the ER, resulting in ER stress and thereby sustained
UPR and caspase activation.
We have previously confirmed that NAC, a classical
ROS inhibitor, can bind to the active site of Aur and block
its inhibiting effects on the proteasomal DUBs. In the
current investigation, NAC completely prevented DSF and
Aur co-treatment from inducing proteasome inhibition,
caspase activation and cell death. To further distinguish
whether ROS generation, DUBs inhibition or both are
required for the cell death induction by the combined
treatment, here we employed another antioxidant agent
Vitamin C, which would not change the effect of Aur
but can rapidly and efficiently eliminate cellular ROS.
We found that Vitamin C successfully scavenged ROS
generation but failed to block Ub-prs accumulation,
PARP cleavage and cell death. This further confirms that
the induction of apoptosis by DSF and Aur combined
treatment depends on DUB inhibition rather than ROS
generation.
By treating nude mice with human hepatoma HepG2
and SMMC-7721 xenografts, we have also demonstrated
here that DSF and Aur show synergistic anticancer effects
in vivo. DSF and Aur co-treatment significantly inhibited
tumor growth, accompanied by Ub-prs accumulation,
PARP cleavage, an activation of caspase 3. Notably, we
have also found that the co-treatment did not inhibit the
body weight while exhibited a remarkable antitumor and
pro-apoptotic activity in the xenograft model.
Originally developed as an anti-rheumatoid arthritis
drug, Aur is actually an inhibitor of proteasomal DUBs
whereas DSF is an inhibitor of aldehyde dehydrogenase
for treating alcoholism; both agents have been used
clinically for several decades and only recently reported
to possess anti-tumor properties. In the current study, we
have unraveled a model of synergism between Aur and

DISCUSSION
DUBs are emerging as a novel target for anticancer
strategy. Recently, a growing number of DUB inhibitors
were discovered and designed to be anti-cancer agents.
As a clinically used anti-rheumatic arthritis drug, Aur,
possesses excellent anticancer property and has proven
to be a promising anticancer agent [20–22]. However,
the underlying mechanisms remain less clear. We have
recently demonstrated that Aur mainly targets proteasomeassociated UCHL5 and USP14 and thereby induces
proteasome inhibition, caspase activation and apoptosis in
several cancer cell lines [23, 24]. To enhance selectivity
and lower the potential toxic side effects of Aur on
normal tissue, we further sought to search for agents that
can synergistically increase the anticancer effect of Aur.
Recent reports have indicated that DSF has antitumor
and chemosensitizing activities. Our present study reveal
that (1) DSF synergistically enhances the cytotoxicity
of Aur, leading to cell death in human hepatoma HepG2
and SMMC-7721 cancer cells; (2) cell death induced by
DSF+Aur co-treatment is dependent on inhibition of the
19S proteasome-associated, caspase activation and ER
stress; (3) blocking caspase activation by z-VAD-FMK
and blocking proteasome inhibition by NAC prevented
the induction of cell death by DSF + Aur co-tretament.
It is known that DSF not only acts as an aldehyde
dehydrogenase inhibitor for alcoholism treatment but also
potentiates the effect of many chemotherapeutic agents.
In the current study, DSF (within 40 μM or 40 mg/kg/d)
itself does not induce cytotoxicity, proteasome inhibition,
or apoptosis in cultured human hepatoma cancer cells
or xenograft models. Aur at rather low doses could only
induce modest cytotoxicity and proteasome inhibition
but these effects were dramatically exacerbated by cotreatment with DSF. These findings suggested that DSF or
its metabolites can synergistically enhance Aur induction
of cytotoxicity and proteasome inhibition directly or
indirectly.
Activation of the caspases cascade is the key event
of apoptosis. Activated caspase-3 cleaves death substrate
PARP to generate a specific 85 kDa apoptotic fragment,
which leads to apoptosis [32]. DSF and Aur combination
induced activation of caspase-8, caspase-9, caspase-3 and
PARP cleavage, suggesting that both the extrinsic and the
intrinsic pathways were involved in the apoptosis. We
further investigated the underlying molecular mechanism.
DSF and Aur combined treatment induced the downregulation of anti-apoptotic proteins like Bcl-2 and BclxL and the enrichment of pro-apoptotic proteins such

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Apoptosis assay was performed according to
previous description [38]. Briefly, cultured HepG2 and
SMMC-7721 cells were harvested and washed with 4°C
PBS twice and resuspended with the binding buffer,
followed by Annexin V-FITC incubation for 15 min and
PI staining for another 15 min in dark. The stained cells
were analyzed with flow cytometry within 30 min. To
monitor temporal changes in the incidence of cell death
in the live culture condition, HepG2 and SMMC-7721
cells were seeded into 6-well plates and PI was added
directly to the cell culture medium, then the cells in the
dish were kinetically imaged with an inverted fluorescence
microscope equipped with a digital camera (Axio Obsever
Z1, Zeiss).

Cell death assay

Materials
Aur and pan caspase inhibitor z-VAD-FMK were
obtained from Enzo Life Sciences International, Inc.
(Plymouth Meeting, PA) and dissolved in DMSO at a
stock concentration of 10 mM, aliquoted and stored at
−80°C. DSF was acquired from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis,
MO). MTS assay (CellTiter 96 Aqueous One Solution
reagent) was purchased from Promega Corporation
(Madison, WI, USA). PI and Annexin V-FITC apoptosis
Detection Kit, DCFH-DA and cell apoptosis Rhodamine
123 Detection Kit were purchased from Keygen Company
(Nanjing, China). Antibodies (Abs) used in this study
were purchased from following sources: anti-ubiquitin

anti-ATF4 (R239), anti-Noxa (EPR9735 [B]), and antiGAPDH (Bioworld Technology, Inc).

Western blot analysis
Western blot analysis was performed as we
described previously [39]. In brief, equal amounts of total
proteins extracted from cultured cells were separated
by 12% SDS–PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene
difluoride (PVDF) membranes. The blots were blocked
with 5% milk for 1 h. Primary Abs and horseradish
peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated secondary Abs were each
incubated for 1 h. The bounded secondary antibodies
were reacted to the ECL detection reagents and exposed
to X-ray films (Kodak, Japan).

Measurement of ROS generation

Cell lines and cell culture

Cancer cells were treated with Aur and/or DSF for
12 h, and then the cells were incubated with the serumfree medium with addition of 10 μM of DCFH-DA for
20 min at 37°C. Following the staining, the cells were
washed with 4°C PBS twice, and then collected for flow
cytometry analysis. The fold changes of mean fluorescence
intensities were shown in the diagram. Mean values and
standard deviations were calculated from triplicates.

Human hepatoma cell lines HepG2 and SMMC7721 were purchased from American Type Culture
Collection (Manassas, VA, USA) and grown in RPMI
1640 supplemented with 10% FBS. Cultured cells were
maintained at 37°C and 5% CO2.

Cell viability assay
MTS assay (CellTiter 96 Aqueous One Solution
reagent) was used to test cell viability as we previously
reported [37]. In brief, exponentially growing HepG2 or
SMMC-7721 cells were seeded at 2500 cells/well in a 96well plate. After incubation for 24 h, cells were treated
with Aur and/or DSF, followed by continuous incubation
for 48 h. 20 μl MTS was directly added to each well
and the incubation was continued for an additional 3 h.
The absorbance of optical density was measured with a
microplate reader (Sunrise, Tecan) at wavelength 490 nm.
Cell viability was calculated by the following formula:

Clonogenic assay
This assay was performed as we previously
described [40]. HepG2 and SMMC-7721 cells exposed to
Aur (0.2 μM), DSF (10 μM) or their combination for 12 h
were suspended in 30% agarose supplemented with 20%
FCS and 50% RPMI-1640 medium then cultured in 60
mm dishes in an atmosphere of 5% CO2 for 7 days, then
stained with 0.3% crystal violet solution. The colonies
> 60 μm were counted under a light microscope. The
experiments were done in triplicate.

effect, and (D) 1 and (D) 2 are the doses of compounds 1
and 2, respectively, necessary to produce the same effect in
combination. CI < 1 indicates synergism; CI =1 indicates
an additive effect; and CI > 1 indicates antagonism.

The mitochondrial membrane potential of Aur and/
or DSF -treated and untreated cells was assayed by using
Rhodamine-123 staining as we previously reported [40].
Cells were treated with Aur and/or DSF for 12 h and
stained with 1 μM of Rhodamine-123 for 30 min at 37°C.
Following the staining, the cells were washed with 4°C
PBS twice, and then harvested for flow cytometry analysis.
Mean values and standard deviations were calculated from
triplicates.

Statistical methods
Mean ± SD are presented where applicable.
Unpaired Student’s t-test or one way ANOVA is used
where appropriate for determining statistic probabilities.
GraphPad Prism4.0 software (GraphPad Software) was
used for statistical analysis. P value less than 0.05 was
considered statistically significant.

Nude mouse xenograft model
Male Balb/c nude mice aged 5 weeks were
purchased from Guangdong Animal Center and housed
in the animal facility of Guangzhou Medical University
approved by the Guangdong Animal Center. The mice
were housed in barrier facilities with a 12 h light dark
cycle, with food and water available ad libitum. Balb/c
mice were inoculated subcutaneously in the left armpit of
each mouse with HepG2 or SMMC-7721 cells (1 × 106
cells/mouse) respectively. After 72 h of inoculation, mice
were randomly divided into 4 × 2 groups and i.p. injected
with either vehicle (10% DMSO, 30% Cremophor EL and
60% normal saline) or Aur (3 mg/kg/day) and/or DSF
(40 mg/kg/day) for totally 15 days respectively. Tumors
were measured every other day with use of calipers. Tumor
volumes were calculated as previously reported. Aur and
DSF were dissolved in the buffer with 10% DMSO, 30%
Cremophor EL and 60% normal saline.

Formalin-fixed xenografts were embedded in
paraffin and sectioned according to standard techniques
as we previously reported [40]. Tumor xenograft sections
(4 μm) were immunostained using the MaxVision
kit (Maixin Biol) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. The primary antibodies were against
ubiquitin and cleaved caspase 3. 50 μl MaxVisionTM
reagent was applied to each slide. Color was developed
with 0.05% diaminobenzidine and 0.03% H2O2 in 50 mM
Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), and the slides were counterstained with
hematoxylin. A negative control for every antibody was
also included for each xenograft specimen by substituting
the primary antibody with preimmune rabbit serum.
