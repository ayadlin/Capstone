Abstract
Continued reliance on the androgen receptor (AR) is now understood as a core mechanism in castrationresistant prostate cancer (CRPC), the most advanced form of this disease. While established and novel AR
pathway–targeting agents display clinical efﬁcacy in metastatic CRPC, dose-limiting side effects remain
problematic for all current agents. In this study, we report the discovery and development of ARN-509, a
competitive AR inhibitor that is fully antagonistic to AR overexpression, a common and important feature of
CRPC. ARN-509 was optimized for inhibition of AR transcriptional activity and prostate cancer cell proliferation,
pharmacokinetics, and in vivo efﬁcacy. In contrast to bicalutamide, ARN-509 lacked signiﬁcant agonist activity in
preclinical models of CRPC. Moreover, ARN-509 lacked inducing activity for AR nuclear localization or DNA
binding. In a clinically valid murine xenograft model of human CRPC, ARN-509 showed greater efﬁcacy than
MDV3100. Maximal therapeutic response in this model was achieved at 30 mg/kg/d of ARN-509, whereas the same
response required 100 mg/kg/d of MDV3100 and higher steady-state plasma concentrations. Thus, ARN-509
exhibits characteristics predicting a higher therapeutic index with a greater potential to reach maximally
efﬁcacious doses in man than current AR antagonists. Our ﬁndings offer preclinical proof of principle for ARN-509
as a promising therapeutic in both castration-sensitive and castration-resistant forms of prostate cancer.

imately 25% of patients (2). The disease is initially sensitive to
androgen deprivation therapies (castration-sensitive disease
state), but resistance is inevitably acquired, leading to CRPC
which is incurable. Despite administration of androgen-depleting therapies, continued androgen receptor (AR) signaling is a
common feature of CRPC, attributed to AR gene ampliﬁcation,
AR gene mutation, increased AR expression, or increased
androgen biosynthesis in prostate tumors (2). Bicalutamide,
a clinically used antiandrogen, competes with androgens for
binding AR; however, in the setting of CRPC, bicalutamide
undergoes an antagonist-to-agonist switch, stimulating AR
activity [measured by increased prostate-speciﬁc antigen
(PSA), an AR-regulated target gene product] and prostate
tumor cell growth. The continued reliance of CRPC on AR
signaling offers opportunities to develop next generation antihormonal agents to treat this disease.
Recently, 2 agents targeting the androgen signaling axis have
undergone late-stage clinical testing for treatment of men with
CRPC (3). Abiraterone acetate targets 7-a-hydroxylase/17,20lyase (CYP17A), thereby inhibiting residual androgen biosynthesis (4, 5), whereas MDV3100 is an antiandrogen discovered
by the Sawyers/Jung groups in a screen for potent antiandrogens lacking agonist activity in context of AR overexpression
(6, 7). In a phase III study, abiraterone acetate (plus the
corticosteroid, prednisone) increased overall survival by 3.9

months over control (prednisone only) in patients with CRPC
previously treated with docetaxel (8). Coadministration of
low-dose prednisone is necessary to ameliorate hypertension,
hypokalemia, and ﬂuid overload resulting from mineralocorticoid excess induced by CYP17 inhibition (8). Whereas coadministration of prednisone is manageable in patients with
metastatic CRPC, longer term use in earlier disease phases
could be problematic due to potential side effects (diabetes,
weight gain, Cushing syndrome, and osteoporosis). In phase I/
II studies of MDV3100, signiﬁcant serum–PSA responses
(>50% decrease) were observed in more than 50% of patients
with chemotherapy-naive and -treated CRPC. MDV3100
belongs to a class of antiandrogens that carry seizure risk,
likely mediated via antagonism of the central nervous system
(CNS)-based GABAA receptor (9). MDV3100 dosing regimens
must achieve exposures at steady state sufﬁcient to drive
therapeutic response without exceeding the threshold for
adverse effects. Antiandrogens with a high therapeutic index
can be expected to result in safer, more effective treatments
across all stages of prostate cancer.
We describe the discovery and preclinical development of
ARN-509, an antiandrogen with similar in vitro activity to
MDV3100 but with greater in vivo activity in CRPC xenograft
models (6). ARN-509 exhibits antitumor activity in a castrationsensitive xenograft model of prostate cancer and antiandrogenic effects in dogs that phenocopy castration. ARN-509, like
MDV3100 and other antiandrogens, binds weakly to GABAA
receptors and could potentially cause seizure at high dose.
However, mouse steady-state plasma and brain levels are lower
for ARN-509 versus MDV3100 at therapeutic doses, suggesting
lower seizure-inducing potential for ARN-509. These data
support clinical development of ARN-509 for treatment of
castration-sensitive and -resistant prostate cancer.

Materials and Methods
Detailed information is presented in Supplementary Materials and Methods. Ligand-binding studies were conducted
either in a whole-cell assay [LNCaP/AR(cs)], using whole-cell
extracts (MDA-MB-453), or in vitro with puriﬁed receptor.
Proliferation assays (VCaP) were conducted in either agonist
or antagonist mode (without/with R1881). RNA was isolated
from LNCaP/AR cells for quantitative RT-PCR analysis with
primers (Supplementary Table S1) speciﬁc for AR target genes.
Fluorescence microscopy was carried out in LNCaP cells
transfected with AR tagged with enhanced yellow ﬂuorescent
protein (AR-EYFP) as previously described (6). AR antibody
PG-21 (Upstate) was used for chromatin immunoprecipitation
(ChIP) experiments [LNCaP/AR(cs)] together with primers for
PSA (10) and TMPRSS2 (11) enhancers. Luciferase reporter
gene assays were conducted in LNCaP/AR-luc or Hep-G2 cells
expressing VP16-AR.
Animal studies at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC, New York), Aragon Pharmaceuticals, and Covance Laboratories, Inc. were conducted under protocols
approved by MSKCC or Aragon Institutional Animal Care
and Use Committees and institutional guidelines for
humane use of animals in research were followed. In vivo

xenograft experiments [LNCaP/AR(cs) or LNCaP/AR-luc]
and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase–mediated dUTP
nick end labeling (TUNEL) and Ki-67 staining were carried
out as previously described (6). As part of an Investigational
New Drug (IND) enabling toxicity/toxicokinetic study, ARN509 was administered to male beagle dogs by Covance
Laboratories, Inc., in accordance with U.S. Food and Drug
Administration (FDA) Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) Regulations. Histologic image ﬁles are available online (12).
Mouse/dog pharmacokinetics was determined by noncompartmental analysis. Tumor and brain tissue distribution
was quantiﬁed by liquid chromatography/tandem mass
spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Serum–protein binding was
assessed in vitro by equilibrium dialysis, using mouse and
human plasma. GABAA-binding experiments in membrane
homogenates of rat cerebral cortex used [35S]TBPS competitor with picrotoxin as a positive-control.

Results
ARN-509 binds AR and inhibits growth and androgenmediated gene transcription in AR-overexpressing
prostate cancer cells
ARN-509 (Fig. 1A) is a synthetic biaryl thiohydantoin
compound discovered using structure–activity relationship
(SAR)-guided medicinal chemistry to identify nonsteroidal
antiandrogens that retain full antagonist activity in the setting
of increased AR expression.
Equilibrium-binding afﬁnity of ARN-509 for AR was
measured in competition with 16b-[18F]ﬂuoro-5a-DHT
(18F-FDHT) in a whole-cell binding assay [LNCaP/AR(cs)
cells; Fig. 1B). ARN-509 (IC50 ¼ 16 nmol/L) binds AR with 7to 10-fold greater afﬁnity than the clinically approved antiandrogen, bicalutamide (median IC50 ¼ 160 nmol/L) and competes for the same binding site in the ligand-binding pocket of
the receptor. Curiously, AR-binding assays using MDA-MB-453
cell extracts does not differentiate between ARN-509 and
bicalutamide, possibly due to cellular uptake differences in
the whole-cell binding assay (Supplementary Fig. S1). Binding
of ARN-509 is selective for AR versus other nuclear hormone
receptors (up to 100 mmol/L), as shown in competitive-binding
assays using in vitro puriﬁed AR or estrogen, progesterone, or
glucocorticoid receptors (ER, PR, or GR; Supplementary
Table S2).
Identiﬁcation of ARN-509 as a lead candidate for preclinical
development was based on initial assessment of both antagonist and agonist activity of AR signaling in the LNCaP/AR(cs)
prostate cancer cell line. This cell line was engineered to
overexpress AR (3- to 5-fold higher than parental LNCaP), thus
mimicking the castration-resistant clinical state (2, 13). In
castration-resistant LNCaP/AR cells, ARN-509 (and MDV3100)
antagonized androgen-mediated induction or repression of
mRNA expression levels for 13 endogenous genes including
PSA and TMPRSS2 whereas bicalutamide was signiﬁcantly less
effective (Fig. 1C). Bicalutamide treatment of LNCaP/AR(cs)
cells in absence of the synthetic androgen R1881 resulted in
altered gene expression consistent with its well-documented
agonist activity in context of AR overexpression. ARN-509 or

To determine whether inhibition of AR signaling by ARN509 is accompanied by reduced tumor cell proliferation,
the number of viable prostate cancer cells was quantiﬁed
following incubation with antiandrogen. ARN-509 fails to
stimulate proliferation of VCaP cells (Fig. 1D, left) and
antagonized the proliferative effect of R1881 (Fig. 1D, right),
whereas bicalutamide induced cell proliferation in a dosedependent manner (Fig. 1D, left), and only partially antagonized the effects of R1881 (Fig. 1D, right). There was no
signiﬁcant effect on growth of AR-negative PC-3 prostate
cancer cells, indicating that antiproliferative effect observed

in VCaP cells is mediated through antagonism of AR (Supplementary Fig. S2).
ARN-509 impairs nuclear localization and DNA binding
in prostate cancer cells
Translocation of AR from cytoplasm to nucleus upon ligand
binding is a highly regulated essential step in AR-mediated
gene regulation. To determine whether ARN-509 impairs AR
nuclear localization and thus reduces the concentration of AR
available to bind androgen response elements (ARE), LNCaP
cells expressing AR-EYFP were treated with dimethyl sulfoxide
(DMSO), R1881, bicalutamide, or ARN-509. Fluorescence intensities of nuclear (N) and cytoplasmic (C) compartments of
individual cells were quantiﬁed and the N/C ratio calculated. In
DMSO-treated cells, AR-EYFP was largely localized to the
cytoplasm (N/C ratio, 0.7), whereas in R1881-treated cells the

receptor was localized predominantly in the nucleus (N/C
ratio, 29; Fig. 2A). Bicalutamide treatment also resulted in a
signiﬁcant amount of nuclear AR (N/C ratio, 13.8), although
less than that observed with R1881 (ref. 6; Fig. 2A). In contrast,
in ARN-509–treated cells much of the AR-EYFP protein
remained cytoplasmic (N/C ratio, 2.5; Fig. 2A). This decrease
in nuclear AR was unrelated to turnover or stability, as ARN509 did not alter steady-state levels of AR as monitored by
immunoblot of whole-cell lysates (data not shown).

To explore whether the low levels of nuclear AR following
ARN-509 treatment could be recruited to promoters of target
genes in prostate cancer cells with potential to modulate
transcription, we carried out ChIP experiments in LNCaP/AR
cells treated with R1881 and/or antiandrogen. AR was not
recruited to the enhancer region of PSA or TMPRSS2 target
genes after ARN-509 or MDV3100 treatment under hormonedepleted conditions (Fig. 2B). In antagonist mode (cotreatment
with R1881 to activate AR), ARN-509 was able to effectively

compete with R1881 and prevent AR from binding to promoter
regions (Fig. 2B). In contrast, bicalutamide exhibited partial
agonist activity as evidenced by induction of DNA binding at
AR target genes and incomplete antagonism of the effects of
R1881 (Fig. 2B).
AR recruitment to DNA promoter elements and activation of
gene transcription requires interplay of protein cofactors in
response to receptor conformational changes upon ligand
binding (14). To remove cofactor recruitment as a variable

that might explain the effects of ARN-509 on AR DNA binding,
we directly assessed the DNA-binding competency of the
residual nuclear AR in ARN-509–treated Hep-G2 cells expressing a VP16-AR fusion protein and an ARE-driven luciferase
reporter. VP16-AR is constitutively nuclear and drives
transcription through AREs in the absence of coactivator
protein recruitment, thereby providing a direct assessment
of ligand-induced DNA binding (6, 14). In absence of
R1881, bicalutamide partially activated VP16-AR–mediated

transcription, indicative of AR binding to DNA. In LNCaP/ARluc cells with a stably integrated AR-driven luciferase reporter
construct (6, 14), bicalutamide was unable to activate wild-type
AR (Fig. 2C, top left). In contrast to bicalutamide, ARN-509 did
not induce signiﬁcant VP16-AR–mediated transcription and
thus is not competent to induce signiﬁcant DNA binding at
concentrations up to 10 mmol/L (Fig. 2C, top right). ARN-509
and MDV3100 inhibited R1881-induced VP16-AR–mediated
transcription with an IC50 value of 0.2 mmol/L (Fig. 2C). In
contrast, in the presence of R1881, bicalutamide showed only
weak partial antagonism of VP16-AR–mediated transcription
(IC50 ¼ 0.35 mmol/L; Fig. 2C, bottom right). This conﬁrms the
ChIP ﬁndings and underscores the fundamental mechanistic
differences between ARN-509 versus bicalutamide.
ARN-509 is a potent inhibitor of tumor growth in murine
xenograft models of CRPC
ARN-509 exhibits low systemic clearance, high oral bioavailability, and long plasma half-life in both mouse and dog,
supporting once daily oral dosing (Supplementary Table S3).
Consistent with its long terminal half-life, ARN-509 steadystate plasma levels increased in repeat dose studies, resulting
in high C24h levels and low peak:trough ratios (ratio, 2.5;
Supplementary Table S4). To assess in vivo pharmacodynamic
activity of ARN-509 in a model of CRPC, castrate male immunodeﬁcient mice harboring LNCaP/AR-luc xenograft tumors
(coexpressing exogenous AR and the AR-dependent reporter
ARR2-Pb-luc) were orally treated with either vehicle or ARN509 (10 mg/kg/d). Following 17 days of treatment, androgendriven luciferase reporter–gene activity, normalized to tumor
volume, was consistently reduced in ARN-509–treated animals
compared with vehicle (Fig. 3A), indicating AR inhibition by
ARN-509 in vivo.
The therapeutic effect of ARN-509 (10 mg/kg/d) was compared with bicalutamide (10 mg/kg/d) in castrate mice bearing
LNCaP/AR(cs) xenograft tumors. On day 28, 7 of 9 vehicletreated tumors increased in size compared with starting volume (Fig. 3B, yellow). The antitumor activity of bicalutamide in
this model was largely restricted to growth inhibition rather
than tumor shrinkage–-only 1 of 10 tumors exhibited more than
50% regression (Fig. 3B, green). In contrast, 8 of 10 ARN-509–
treated tumors regressed by more than 50% (volume), including
2 tumors that were no longer palpable (Fig. 3B, red). Similar
results were obtained in castrate male SCID mice bearing
LNCaP/AR-luc xenograft tumors (Supplementary Fig. S3).
Greater efﬁcacy of ARN-509 was achieved despite 3-fold lower
steady-state plasma levels (mean C24h concentrations: 9.69 mg/
mL ARN-509 vs. 30.74 mg/mL bicalutamide). Consistent with
the potent antitumor effect, ARN-509–treated tumors exhibited
a 60% decrease in proliferative index (vs. vehicle) and a 10-fold
increase in apoptotic rate (vs. vehicle) as monitored by Ki-67
staining and TUNEL, respectively (Fig. 3C and D).
To further understand the clinical potential of ARN-509,
we compared its antitumor activity to MDV3100 in a series
of independent experiments. Castrate male mice bearing
LNCaP/AR xenograft tumors were treated with either ARN509 or MDV3100 at doses of 1, 10, or 30 mg/kg/d. Both
compounds showed a dose-responsive effect (Fig. 4A and B)

trending towards greater efﬁcacy for ARN-509 versus
MDV3100, although none of the pairwise (equidose) comparisons of day 28 tumor volumes reached statistical signiﬁcance, due to relatively small cohort size (n ¼ 7–8). To
deﬁne the optimal biological dose (OBD: lowest dose yielding maximum efﬁcacy) for both ARN-509 and MDV3100,
tumor responses in the LNCaP/AR(cs) model were monitored at 30 and 100 mg/kg/d in larger cohorts to increase
statistical power (n ¼ 19–20). Thirteen of 20 ARN-509
(30 mg/kg/d)-treated animals exhibited more than 50%
reduction in tumor volume at day 28 versus 3 of 19 MDV3100
(30 mg/kg/d)-treated mice (Fig. 4C). A higher MDV3100 dose
(100 mg/kg/d) resulted in increased efﬁcacy (12 of 19 tumors
with >50% reduction in tumor volume) compared with the

30 mg/kg/d dose. In contrast, ARN-509 dosed at 100 mg/kg/d
(13 of 19 mice with >50% reduction in tumor volume) was no
more efﬁcacious than 30 mg/kg/d. There was no difference in
efﬁcacy between ARN-509 and MDV3100 at 100 mg/kg/d,
despite a dose-dependent increase in exposure (ARN-509 and
MDV3100 from 30–100 mg/kg) as measured by independent
single-dose mouse pharmacokinetic studies (Supplementary
Table S5). These results indicate an OBD in the LNCaP/AR
model between 10 to 30 mg/kg/d for ARN-509, whereas the
OBD for MDV3100 lies between 30 to 100 mg/kg/d.
To deﬁne concentrations of ARN-509 necessary to drive
therapeutic responses, we measured steady-state plasma and
tumor–tissue concentrations following 28 days of continuous
dosing of LNCaP/AR(cs) tumor-bearing mice. Steady-state
plasma concentrations for ARN-509 were approximately 2- to
4-fold lower than for an equivalent dose of MDV3100 (Table 1
and Supplementary Table S5), whereas intratumoral levels of
ARN-509 and MDV3100 were roughly equivalent, indicating a
higher tumor/plasma ratio for ARN-509 (Table 1). A comparative single-dose intravenous pharmacokinetic assessment in
mice indicated higher steady-state volume-of-distribution
(Vss) for ARN-509 (2.1 L/kg; Supplementary Table S3) versus
MDV3100 (0.82 L/kg; Supplementary Table S6). One determinant of Vss is degree of binding to plasma proteins. Assessment
of in vitro free fraction in plasma indicated that ARN-509 is less
protein bound, resulting in an approximately 2-fold greater free

fraction than MDV3100 in mouse and human plasma (Supplementary Table S7).
Recent reports indicate that multiple antiandrogens are also
functional antagonists of the GABAA receptor, implicated to
cause seizure in preclinical species and in humans (9). ARN-509
and MDV3100 both exhibit low micromolar afﬁnity (IC50 ¼ 3.0
and 2.7 mmol/L, respectively) for the GABAA receptor in radioligand binding assays (Supplementary Fig. S4) and thus may
potentially antagonize GABAA at therapeutic dose levels.
Degree of permeability of the blood–brain barrier to ARN509 or MDV3100 is a further determinant of seizure risk.
Steady-state brain tissue levels of both ARN-509 and MDV3100
(10 mg/kg/d) were measured in mice after 28 days of daily
therapy. Unexpectedly, ARN-509 brain levels were 4-fold lower
than those observed with MDV3100 treatment (Table 2), thus
suggesting lower seizurogenic potential for ARN-509.
ARN-509 induces castrate-like histopathologic changes
in androgen-dependent tissues in dogs
Robust antiandrogenic activity in the noncastrate setting
would support clinical assessment of ARN-509 in the castration-sensitive phase of prostate cancer. To determine antiandrogenic effects of ARN-509 in context of normal levels of
androgen, we assessed effects on androgen-dependent reproductive organs of adult male dogs and on LNCaP/AR xenograft
tumor growth in intact male mice.

ARN-509 dosed at 10 mg/kg/d for 28 days resulted in a 3-fold
reduction in weight of dog prostates. Epididymis weight was
also reduced (1.7-fold); however, this effect did not reach
statistical signiﬁcance (Fig. 5A). Histopathologic analysis of
prostates of ARN-509–treated animals showed lack of glandular secretory activity, similar to prostates of sexually immature
or castrate animals (Fig. 5B, right).
Antiandrogenic effects on spermatogenesis were evident in
ARN-509–treated animals. Epididymides of ARN-509–treated
animals exhibited histologic changes consistent with antiandrogen-induced atrophy and contained minimal spermatozoa
(Fig. 5B, left). Epididymides of vehicle-treated dogs were normal, with abundant spermatozoa (Fig. 5B, left).
Cell proliferation in dog prostate tissues treated with ARN509 was signiﬁcantly lower (reduced Ki-67 staining) than in
vehicle-treated animals (Fig. 5C). Despite signiﬁcant atrophy
and the well-described increase in prostatic apoptosis following castration (15), there was no change in apoptotic rate in
ARN-509–treated prostates (TUNEL staining), suggesting
that atrophy, if driven by apoptosis, was advanced and complete at 28 days of treatment (Fig. 5C). The epididymides of
ARN-509–treated animals exhibited a tendency towards lower
proliferative and higher apoptotic indices compared with
vehicle-treated animals, although Ki-67- or TUNEL-positive
cells were rare (Supplementary Fig. S5).
Consistent with the antiandrogenic effects observed in the
dog, ARN-509 displayed signiﬁcant antitumor activity in
LNCaP/AR(cs) xenografts growing in intact (noncastrate) mice
(Fig. 5D). At 10 mg/kg/d, the antitumor effect of ARN-509 was
largely conﬁned to stabilization of tumor growth. At higher
doses of 30 mg/kg/d, robust tumor regression (>50% reduction
in starting tumor volume) was observed in 6 of 8 ARN-509–
treated animals, similar to regressions observed in mice
castrated on the day treatment initiated.

Discussion
ARN-509 is a next generation antiandrogen selected for
preclinical and clinical development based on its efﬁcacy and
pharmacodynamic proﬁle in mouse xenograft models of CRPC.
Unexpectedly, given a similar in vitro proﬁle, ARN-509 is more
efﬁcacious per unit dose and per unit steady-state plasma level
in mouse models of CRPC than MDV3100. Maximal efﬁcacy at
lower steady-state plasma and brain levels should result in a
higher therapeutic index and enable dose-escalation in man
with reduced risk of seizure and other side effects. We propose
that the ability of ARN-509 to drive efﬁcacy with signiﬁcantly
lower exposures at steady state is a function of reduced binding
to plasma proteins, resulting in greater tumor:plasma ratios
and more robust antagonism of AR activity. Importantly and

unexpectedly, the greater free fraction of ARN-509 does not
result in higher steady-state brain levels which otherwise could
negate any increase in therapeutic index as it relates to GABAA
antagonism.
The ARN-509 pharmacologic effects on male reproductive
organs, and antitumor activity on LNCaP/AR tumors in intact
mice, suggests potential to treat the castration-sensitive disease phase. In particular, given the improved proﬁle of ARN-509
over bicalutamide, "combined androgen blockade" [ARN-509
dosed in conjunction with luteinizing hormone–releasing hormone (LHRH) agonists/antagonists] may be useful in treatment of recurrent disease following primary treatment by
surgery or radiation. Given its potential for a high therapeutic
index, ARN-509 is also well suited to combination therapy with
other agents that target key pathways [e.g., phosphoinositide 3kinase (PI3K)] in prostate tumorigenesis (16).
ARN-509 has completed dose-escalation phase I study in
metastatic CRPC to determine human pharmacokinetics, safety, and efﬁcacy (via endpoints of PSA response and time-to-PSA
progression) and has proceeded into phase II clinical development in distinct subsets of prostate cancer.
