Abstract
Inhibition of VEGF signaling can promote lymph node metastasis in preclinical models, but the mechanism is
not fully understood, and successful methods of prevention have not been found. Signaling of hepatocyte growth
factor (HGF) and its receptor c-Met can promote the growth of lymphatics and metastasis of some tumors. We
sought to explore the contributions of c-Met signaling to lymph node metastasis after inhibition of VEGF
signaling. In particular, we examined whether c-Met is upregulated in lymphatics in or near pancreatic
neuroendocrine tumors in RIP-Tag2 transgenic mice and whether lymph node metastasis can be reduced by
concurrent inhibition of VEGF and c-Met signaling. Inhibition of VEGF signaling by anti-VEGF antibody or
sunitinib in mice from the age of 14 to 17 weeks was accompanied by more intratumoral lymphatics, more tumor
cells inside lymphatics, and more lymph node metastases. Under these conditions, lymphatic endothelial cells,
like tumor cells, had strong immunoreactivity for c-Met and phospho-c-Met. c-Met blockade by the selective
inhibitor, PF-04217903, signiﬁcantly reduced metastasis to local lymph nodes. Together, these results indicate
that inhibition of VEGF signaling in RIP-Tag2 mice upregulates c-Met expression in lymphatic endothelial cells,
increases the number of intratumoral lymphatics and number of tumor cells within lymphatics, and promotes
metastasis to local lymph nodes. Prevention of lymph node metastasis by PF-04217903 in this setting implicates cMet signaling in tumor cell spread to lymph nodes. Cancer Res; 73(12); 3692–703. 2013 AACR.

Introduction
Metastasis to regional lymph nodes is a feature of many solid
tumors. The presence of lymph node metastasis is an important prognostic factor and the basis for surgical excision and
radiation of local lymph nodes (1). Lymph node metastasis
occurs after tumor cells enter lymphatics within or near
tumors and drain to sentinel nodes (1). Tumor-associated
lymphangiogenesis promotes the process (2–4) by increasing
the number of routes to lymph nodes.
Reports of recent preclinical studies indicate that tumor
invasiveness and metastasis can increase after inhibition of

VEGF signaling (5–8). The mechanism of the increased aggressiveness is unknown, but contributing factors are likely to
include increased intratumoral hypoxia as a result of vessel
pruning. Hypoxia can increase expression of c-Met, the hepatocyte growth factor receptor (HGFR), the receptor tyrosine
kinase (RTK) activated by HGF (9). Activation of c-Met can
drive tumor cell motility, proliferation, invasion, and survival
(10–12). The HGF/c-Met pathway is activated in a wide variety
of solid tumors (12, 13), correlates with poor prognosis (14–16),
and is thought to contribute to tumor aggressiveness and
resistance (17). c-Met expression in tumors can increase after
treatment with inhibitors of VEGF signaling that promote
vascular pruning and intratumoral hypoxia (8–10). c-Met
activation can drive lymphangiogenesis (18, 19), which could
favor lymph node metastasis.
Metastases are more abundant in the liver of RIP-Tag2
transgenic mice after treatment with function-blocking antiVEGFR2 antibody, sunitinib, or neutralizing anti-VEGF antibody (7, 8). The same has been found in lymph nodes of these
mice after treatment with anti-VEGFR2 antibody (7), although
the effects of age and duration of treatment have not been
examined in detail.
The present study examined the involvement of c-Met
signaling in lymph node metastasis after inhibition of VEGF
signaling. Speciﬁcally, we sought to learn whether the treatment increases c-Met expression and activation in the lymphatic vessels and augments lymph node metastasis, and
whether inhibition of c-Met signaling can reduce tumor spread
to lymph nodes. We addressed these issues by determining the

Reduction of Lymph Node Metastasis by c-Met Inhibition

effects of VEGF signaling blockade on c-Met expression in
lymphatic vessels and on number of intratumoral lymphatics,
tumor cells inside lymphatics, and amount of lymph node
metastasis. We then determined whether inhibition of c-Met
signaling reduced tumor cells inside lymphatics and lymph
node metastasis.
The approach was to manipulate c-Met signaling in RIPTag2 mice, which are known to develop lymph node metastasis
after inhibition of VEGF signaling (7). VEGF signaling was
blocked by treatment with a neutralizing anti-VEGF antibody
or with sunitinib, a multitargeted RTK inhibitor of VEGF
receptor (VEGFR), platelet-derived growth factor, c-KIT, and
related kinases (20). c-Met signaling was blocked by the
selective inhibitor, PF-04217903, to determine the effects on
lymph node metastasis (21).
The experiments revealed that inhibition of VEGF signaling
increased c-Met expression in lymphatics and tumor cells and
also increased the number of intratumoral lymphatics, tumor
cells inside lymphatics, and metastases in local lymph nodes.
Inhibition of c-Met signaling blocked the exaggerated lymph
node metastasis accompanying inhibition of VEGF signaling.

Materials and Methods
Animals and treatment
Lymph node metastasis was studied in RIP-Tag2 transgenic mice (C57BL/6 background), which develop spontaneous multifocal, multistage pancreatic neuroendocrine
tumors driven by expression of SV40 T antigen in pancreatic
bcells (22). Six groups of mice (5–7 mice/group each experiment) were treated from the age of 14 to 17 weeks with: (i)
vehicle (0.5% sodium carboxymethyl cellulose (ICN Biomedicals, Inc), 1.8% (w/v) NaCl, 0.4% (v/v) Tween-80 (Sigma
Chemical), 0.9% benzyl alcohol (v/v; Sigma-Aldrich), 5 mL/g
given daily by gavage, (ii) afﬁnity puriﬁed, function-blocking
goat anti-mouse VEGF antibody (AF-493-NA; R&D Systems;
150 mg in 50 mL sterile PBS) injected intraperitoneally 3 times
per week (Monday, Wednesday, Friday), (iii) sunitinib (Pﬁzer; 40 mg/kg in 5 mL vehicle) given daily by gavage, (iv) PF04217903 (Pﬁzer; 30 mg/kg in 5 mL vehicle) given daily by
gavage, (v) anti-VEGF antibody plus PF-04217903, or (vi)
sunitinib plus PF-04217903. In group (vi), the agents were
premixed and administered together.
Body weight and survival were recorded during the treatment. Some RIP-Tag2 mice received pimonidazole hydrochloride (60 mg/kg i.v; Hypoxyprobe Plus Kit HP2; Chemicon) 1
hour before perfusion to detect hypoxic regions in tumors.
Untreated 14-week-old RIP-Tag2 mice (n ¼ 5) were used as
baseline control. Fourteen-week-old wild-type C57BL/6 mice
(n ¼ 5) were also examined.
In separate experiments, mice were treated from the age of
14 to 15 weeks with vehicle, anti-mouse VEGF antibody, or
sunitinib, and tumors were removed for quantitative real-time
PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis.
Mice were housed under barrier conditions in the animal
care facility at the University of California, San Francisco
(UCSF; San Francisco, CA). The UCSF Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee approved all experimental
procedures.

Tissue preparation, immunohistochemistry, and imaging
At the end of treatment, mice were anesthetized with
ketamine (100 mg/kg i.p.) plus xylazine (10 mg/kg i.p.), and
tissues were ﬁxed by vascular perfusion of 1% paraformaldehyde in PBS (23). Some tissues were prepared for hematoxylin
and eosin (H&E) staining. Cryostat sections (80 mm thick) were
processed for immunohistochemistry using 2 or 3 primary
antibodies (23): guinea pig anti-swine insulin antibody (1:100;
Dako), rabbit anti-SV40 T-antigen antibody (1:500; Santa Cruz
Biotechnology), rat anti-mouse lymphatic vessel endothelial
hyaluronic acid receptor (LYVE)–1 antibody (1:500; R&D Systems), goat anti-mouse HGFR antibody (1:500; R&D Systems),
rabbit anti-mouse phosphorylated c-Met antibody (1:250; Invitrogen), goat anti-VEGFR-3 antibody (1:1,000; R&D Systems),
rabbit anti-Prox1 antibody (1:500; AngioBio), goat anti-mouse
HGF antibody (1:500; R&D Systems), rabbit anti-VEGFR-2
antibody T014 (1:2,000; from Rolf Brekken, University of Texas
Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, TX), rabbit anti-phosphohistone H3 antibody (PHH3 1:1,000; Millipore), or ﬂuorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated mouse anti-pimonidazole hydrochloride (1:100; Chemicon).
Secondary antibodies were FITC-, Cy3- or Cy5-labeled donkey anti-goat, anti-rabbit, anti-rat, or anti-guinea pig immunoglobulin G antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch; all diluted
1:500). Cell nuclei were stained with Vectashield mounting
medium containing 40 ,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (Vector
laboratories). Specimens were examined with a Zeiss Axiophot
ﬂuorescence microscope and a Zeiss LSM 510 laser scanning
confocal microscope (23).
The methods used for measuring tumor size and mRNA
expression of Prox1, VEGF-A, VEGF-C, and VEGF-D are presented in the Supplementary Materials and Methods.
Measurements of lymphatics and lymph node metastases
Pancreas and pancreatic lymph nodes from each mouse (5–7
mice/group) were removed and processed together. Sections
of pancreas (80 mm thick) from 5 to 7 mice per group were
examined. Intratumoral lymphatics, identiﬁed as LYVE-1immunoreactive vessels completely surrounded by insulinimmunoreactive tumor cells, were counted in all tumors
present in two 80 mm thick sections of pancreas. As tumors
were larger in the vehicle and PF-04217903 groups, an average
of 5 tumors were analyzed in those groups, whereas 10 to 15
smaller tumors were analyzed in the other treatment groups.
Digital ﬂuorescence microscopic images (5 objective, 1
Optovar) of tumors were combined as montages to show the
entire tumor. The sectional area of tumors was measured, and
the number of intratumoral lymphatics was expressed as
lymphatics per mm2 of tumor section.
To distinguish growing lymphatics in tumors from lymphatics co-opted by invading tumor cells, we counted intratumoral
lymphatics with evidence of endothelial cell proliferation,
deﬁned as one or more phosphohistone H3-positive endothelial cells. Tumors in 5 mice per group were analyzed.
The frequency of lymphatics containing tumor cells was
expressed as the proportion of LYVE-1–positive lymphatics
with one or more SV40 T-antigen–positive tumor cells within
the lumen per section of pancreas. A total of 25 to 30

intratumoral lymphatics were examined in each mouse in all
groups.
Lymph node metastases were identiﬁed by the presence of
SV40 T-antigen–positive tumor cells in pancreatic lymph nodes.
The incidence of metastasis was determined in 5 to 7 mice per
group and was expressed as the proportion of lymph nodes that
contained SV40 T-antigen–positive cells in a survey of at least
four 80 mm thick sections cut at multiple levels (average 240 mm
increment). Each section contained 3 to 5 lymph nodes.
Assessment of HGF, c-Met, and phospho-c-Met
immunoreactivities
The abundance of HGF immunoreactive cells in tumors or
lymph nodes was estimated as the area density of HGF staining
in digital ﬂuorescence microscopic images (10 objective, 1
Optovar) of RIP-Tag2 tumors or lymph nodes. Tumor cells
were marked in the same sections by staining for SV40 T
antigen or insulin. Lymph nodes were identiﬁed by the distinctive LYVE-1 staining. The area density was measured at a
predetermined threshold with ImageJ (23).
The proportion of c-Met or phospho-c-Met–positive
lymphatic vessels was expressed as the proportion of LYVE1–positive intratumoral lymphatics that had c-Met or phospho-c-Met immunoreactivity in 80 mm sections of pancreas.
The abundance of tumor cells with c-Met or phospho-c-Met
immunoreactivity was expressed as the proportion of SV40 Tantigen or insulin immunoreactive cells that colocalized with
c-Met or phospho-c-Met.
Statistical analysis
Differences among groups were assessed by ANOVA followed by Fisher least signiﬁcant difference test for multiple
comparisons. Error bars show mean  SEM. Fisher exact test
was used to compare the incidence of lymph node metastasis.
P < 0.05 was considered signiﬁcant.

Results
Increased lymph node metastasis after inhibition of
VEGF signaling
To build on the published report of exaggeration of lymph
node metastasis by inhibition of VEGF signaling in RIP-Tag2
mice (7), we sought to obtain conﬁrmatory data after treatment with anti-VEGF antibody or sunitinib before attempting
to block it. As an indicator of lymph node metastasis, we used
the presence of SV40 T-antigen–immunoreactive tumor cells
in pancreatic lymph nodes. These lymph nodes include gastric,
pancreatic-duodenal, and colic lymph nodes (24). The lymph
nodes were removed, processed, and examined together with
the pancreas.
At least one of the pancreatic lymph nodes contained SV40
T-antigen–positive cells in all RIP-Tag2 mice examined at 17
weeks of age, regardless of the treatment (Fig. 1A), but the
proportion of positive nodes varied with the treatment. Only
50% of the pancreatic lymph nodes had metastases after
vehicle for 3 weeks, but 78% had metastases after anti-VEGF
antibody, and 81% had metastases after sunitinib (Fig. 1B).
Most metastatic tumor cells were within the LYVE-1–positive
cortical sinus of the lymph node (Fig. 1A).

Increased intratumoral lymphatics after inhibition of
VEGF signaling
To explore these ﬁndings further, we asked whether the
higher incidence of lymph node metastasis after inhibition of
VEGF signaling was accompanied by more intratumoral lymphatics, more invasion of tumor cells into peritumoral lymphatics, or both (1, 3, 25, 26). We found that intratumoral
lymphatics detected by LYVE-1 immunoreactivity were more
numerous after inhibition of VEGF signaling from the age of 14
to 17 weeks (Fig. 2A).
We assessed the effectiveness of LYVE-1 as a marker
of lymphatics in RIP-Tag2 tumors by comparing the staining
for VEGFR-3, podoplanin, and Prox1 (27). VEGFR-3 immunoreactivity in RIP-Tag2 tumors was found in lymphatics and
blood vessels (Fig. 2B, i; ref. 23). Podoplanin immunoreactivity
was detected in lymphatics and epithelial cells of pancreatic
ducts (data not shown), but most Prox1 immunoreactivity was
in lymphatic endothelial cell nuclei (Fig. 2B, ii). In comparison,
VEGFR-2 immunoreactivity was in blood vessels and lymphatics of tumors and lymph nodes (Supplementary Fig. S1A).
Intratumoral lymphatics were more abundant in tumors
of mice treated with vehicle from the age of 14 to 17 weeks than
in untreated RIP-Tag2 mice at the age of 14 weeks (onset
control; Fig. 2C, i). After anti-VEGF antibody or sunitinib,
intratumoral lymphatics were 93% or 79% more numerous
than after vehicle (Fig. 2C, i). Consistent with the greater
abundance of intratumoral lymphatics, expression of Prox1
mRNA was 2.5 times greater in tumors after anti-VEGF antibody and 3 times greater after sunitinib, from the age of 14 to
15 weeks (Fig. 2C, ii).
Expression of the lymphangiogenic factors, VEGF-C and
VEGF-D, in untreated RIP-Tag2 tumors was much lower than
VEGF-A (Supplementary Fig. S1B, i), which is known to be
highly expressed in RIP-Tag2 tumor cells (28). However,
expression of both VEGF-C and VEGF-D was increased after
treatment with sunitinib from the age of 14 to 15 weeks
(Supplementary Fig. S1B, ii and S1B, iii).
The contribution of lymphangiogenesis to the increase in
intratumoral lymphatics after anti-VEGF therapy was assessed
by determining the frequency of proliferating lymphatic endothelial cells detected by phosphohistone H3 immunoreactivity.
In vehicle-treated mice, an average of 5 lymphatics had one or
more phosphohistone H3-positive endothelial cells per section
of pancreas (5–6 tumors analyzed in each of 5 mice; Fig. 2D, i).
In comparison, after sunitinib, none of the tumors had phosphohistone H3-positive cells that colocalized with LYVE-1
staining (10–13 tumors analyzed in each of the 5 mice; Fig.
2D, ii).
Because we found no evidence for lymphatic proliferation
after sunitinib, we asked whether inhibition of VEGF signaling
was accompanied by tumor cell invasion into peritumoral
lymphatics. Tumors of mice treated with sunitinib had the
appearance of being more invasive, in that their border was
more irregular and penetrated the acinar pancreas (Fig. 3A,
i and ii). After sunitinib, tumors were also accompanied by
more LYVE-1–positive lymphatics (Fig. 3B, i and ii and C, i and
ii), and more lymphatics had intraluminal tumor cells (Fig. 3D, i
and ii). The proportion of lymphatics with SV40 T-antigen–

positive tumor cells inside was 58% higher after sunitinib than
after vehicle (Fig. 3D, iii).
These differences in RIP-Tag2 mice treated from the age of
14 to 17 weeks accompanied conspicuous treatment-related
differences in tumor size, indicated by mean sectional area:
19.2  6.3 mm2 after vehicle, 4.3  0.8 mm2 after anti-VEGF
antibody (78% less than vehicle), and 3.7  0.8 mm2 after
sunitinib (81% less than vehicle; ref. 8).
Increased c-Met expression after inhibition of VEGF
signaling
The involvement of c-Met signaling in the changes in
lymphatics and lymphatic metastases was examined by immunohistochemical assessment of the amount of the receptor and
receptor activation reﬂected by c-Met and phospho-c-Met
immunoreactivities. In the normal pancreas of wild-type mice,
c-Met immunoreactivity was not detected in pancreatic islets
or in lymphatics (Fig. 4A, i). In RIP-Tag2 mice treated with
vehicle from the age of 14 to 17 weeks, c-Met immunoreactivity
was strong in some blood vessels, but was weak or absent in
tumor cells and lymphatics (Fig. 4A, ii and Supplementary Fig.
S2A, i). In comparison, after treatment with sunitinib, strong cMet immunoreactivity was found in tumor cells, lymphatics

(Fig. 4A, iii and Supplementary Fig. S2A, ii and S2A, iii), and
blood vessels (Supplementary Fig. S2B).
The proportion of lymphatics with c-Met immunoreactivity,
which was zero in wild-type islets, was 43% in tumors after
vehicle, although weak in intensity, and was signiﬁcantly
greater (73%–75%) after treatment with anti-VEGF antibody
or sunitinib (Fig. 4B, i). The intensity of c-Met immunoreactivity in lymphatics was also greater after anti-VEGF therapy
(Fig. 4B, ii). The proportion of tumor cells with c-Met immunoreactivity increased from 2% after vehicle to 73% after antiVEGF antibody and 74% after sunitinib (Fig. 4B, iii).
The increase in c-Met immunoreactivity after sunitinib was
accompanied by reduced vascular density (8) and more severe
intratumoral hypoxia, assessed by pimonidazole staining (Supplementary Fig. S2C, i). However, staining for c-Met was
present throughout tumors, though variable in intensity, and
was not restricted to regions of pimonidazole staining (Supplementary Fig. S2C, ii).
Phospho-c-Met immunoreactivity was detected in scattered
cells in tumors treated with vehicle (Fig. 4C, i), but was stronger
and more widespread after sunitinib (Fig. 4C, ii). Staining for
phospho-c-Met was found in lymphatic endothelial cells as
well as in tumor cells (Fig. 4D, i and Supplementary Fig. S3A). As

primary antibody was omitted (Supplementary Fig. S3B). The
proportion of phospho-c-Met immunoreactive lymphatics and
tumor cells was signiﬁcantly more after anti-VEGF antibody or

inside lymphatics had immunoreactivity for c-Met and for

Decreased intratumoral lymphatics after inhibition of
c-Met and VEGF signaling
To determine whether the number of intratumoral lymphatics in RIP-Tag2 mice treated with anti-VEGF antibody or
sunitinib could be reduced by inhibiting c-Met, we examined
the effects of the selective inhibitor PF-04217903 given from the

age of 14 to 17 weeks. Tumors treated with PF-04217903
together with anti-VEGF antibody or sunitinib had signiﬁcantly fewer lymphatics than after VEGF inhibitor alone and were
comparable with the vehicle (Fig. 5A). Intratumoral lymphatics
were 53% less abundant after PF-04217903 plus anti-VEGF
antibody and 75% less after PF-04217903 plus sunitinib (Fig.
5B). With both drug combinations, c-Met–positive lymphatics
were less than half as numerous as after the anti-VEGF
antibody or sunitinib alone (Supplementary Fig. S2C, i), and
phospho-c-Met–positive lymphatics were reduced essentially
to zero (Supplementary Fig. S3C, i). Tumors treated with PF04217903 alone tended to have less intratumoral lymphatics
than after vehicle, but the difference was not statistically
signiﬁcant (Fig. 5A).

Decreased tumor cells in lymphatics after inhibition
of c-Met and VEGF signaling
Blockade of c-Met by PF-04217903, together with VEGF
signaling inhibition by sunitinib, reduced tumor cell invasion
into lymphatics and into the acinar pancreas. Addition of the cMet inhibitor to sunitinib did not lead to further reduction in
tumor size, but did change tumor borders from an irregular,
invasive phenotype to a smoother contour (Fig. 6A). Intratumoral and peritumoral lymphatics, which were abundant and
contained tumor cells after sunitinib, were less numerous and
had few or no tumor cells when PF-04217903 was also given
(Fig. 6B and C).

The proportion of lymphatics with tumor cells inside was
58% less after PF-04217903 plus sunitinib than after sunitinib
alone (Fig. 6D, i–iii) and was 46% less after PF-04217903 alone
than after vehicle (Fig. 6D, iii). Fewer tumor cells stained for cMet (Supplementary Fig. S2D, ii) or phospho-c-Met (Supplementary Fig. S3C, ii) after treatment with PF-04217903 alone or

tumors and lymph nodes (HGF area density 4% in tumors
and 20% in lymph nodes) of vehicle-treated RIP-Tag2 mice
(Supplementary Fig. S4A, i and S4A, ii). The amount of HGF
immunoreactivity was less after PF-04217903 alone but was

Decreased lymph node metastasis after inhibition of
c-Met and VEGF signaling
The pronounced effect of PF-04217903, on intratumoral
lymphatics and lymphatics that had tumor cells inside, led us
to determine whether lymph node metastases were also
reduced. We found signiﬁcantly fewer lymph node metastases
in mice treated with PF-04217903 as a single agent (80%
reduction; Fig. 7A, i and ii and B). Importantly, lymph node
metastases were also less numerous when PF-04217903 was
given together with anti-VEGF antibody (75% reduction) or
sunitinib (75% reduction; Fig. 7A, iii–vi and B).

Discussion
The present study sought to determine the involvement
of c-Met signaling in lymph node metastasis after inhibition
of VEGF signaling in RIP-Tag2 mice. We found that the
number of intratumoral lymphatics, proportion of lymphatics containing tumor cells, and incidence of lymph node
metastasis were all increased after inhibition of VEGF
signaling by a function blocking anti-VEGF antibody or
sunitinib. However, this was not found when c-Met was
blocked by concurrent administration of the selective inhibitor PF-04217903. The addition of the c-Met blocker significantly reduced intratumoral lymphatics, tumor cells inside
lymphatics, and lymph node metastases. Together, the
results indicate that inhibition of c-Met in this model can

reduce lymph node metastasis in the presence of VEGF
blockade.
Lymph node metastasis after VEGF inhibition
Most angiogenesis inhibitors used for cancer therapy block
VEGF signaling (29). This action stops sprouting angiogenesis,
prunes tumor vessels, normalizes surviving tumor vessels, and
reduces tumor growth (23, 30, 31).

www.aacrjournals.org

Vascular pruning in tumors can lead to hypoxia, upregulation of hypoxia inducible factor-1a, increase of c-Met expression, and promotion of cell proliferation, motility, and invasion
(9, 10, 32, 33). Increased tumor invasiveness found after inhibition of VEGF signaling could reﬂect this mechanism (5–8).
Treatment of RIP-Tag2 mice with anti-VEGF antibody or
sunitinib from the age of 14 to 17 weeks increased c-Met and
phospho-c-Met immunoreactivities in lymphatic endothelial
cells. Intratumoral lymphatics and lymph node metastases
were also more abundant. The increase in lymph node metastasis ﬁts with the known relationship between the abundance
of intratumoral lymphatics and incidence of lymph node
metastasis (1, 3, 25, 26, 34, 35).
In the present study, 4 different markers were used to
identify lymphatic vessels: LYVE-1, Prox1, VEGFR-3, and podoplanin. All are considered reliable markers of lymphatics, but
some also label other cells. Prox1 is present in some colorectal
cancer cells (36). VEGFR-3 and podoplanin marked lymphatic
endothelial cells in RIP-Tag2 tumors but also marked some
blood vessels and other cell types. However, LYVE-1 and Prox1
immunoreactivities in RIP-Tag2 tumors were mainly associated with lymphatic endothelial cells.
Treatment of RIP-Tag2 mice with anti-VEGF antibody or
sunitinib from the age of 14 to 17 weeks led to a 75% or more
decrease in tumor size but a 4-fold increase in number of
intratumoral lymphatics. The increase in intratumoral lymphatics could result from growth of new lymphatics, from
tumor cell co-option of peritumoral lymphatics, or both. The
anti-VEGF antibody blocks VEGF-A, but not VEGF-C or VEGFD, and sunitinib blocks the signaling of all VEGFRs. Lymphangiogenesis is generally thought to be driven by activation of
VEGFR-2 and/or VEGFR-3 signaling by VEGF-C, VEGF-D, or in
some cases VEGF-A (37–39). VEGF-C and VEGF-D are
expressed by a cells of the islets of Langerhans in human
pancreas (40) but were relatively low in untreated RIP-Tag2
tumors. However, VEGF-C and VEGF-D were signiﬁcantly
increased in tumors after treatment with sunitinib.
Lymphatic endothelial cell growth and lymph node metastasis are reduced in a breast cancer model after inhibition of
VEGFR-2 and VEGFR-3 by antibodies or sunitinib (41, 42).
Overexpression of VEGF-A in the skin of transgenic mice can
promote lymphangiogenesis at sites of wound healing, but
systemic blockade of VEGFR-2 prevents the formation of
lymphatics (43). Sunitinib inhibits lymphangiogenesis in
tumors under some conditions (7). Differences between our
ﬁndings and some published data could reﬂect the tumor
model, stage of tumor progression, and duration of treatment.
Proliferating endothelial cells marked by phosphohistone
H3 immunoreactivity were found in intratumoral lymphatics
of mice treated with vehicle but not with sunitinib. This ﬁnding
ﬁts better with co-option of peritumoral lymphatics than with
lymphangiogenesis as the source of more abundant intratumoral lymphatics after sunitinib.
Effects of inhibition of VEGF signaling on lymph node
metastasis seem to be context- and time-dependent. Promotion of lymph node metastasis by sunitinib was not evident in
RIP-Tag2 mice treated from the age of 10 to 15 weeks (7), unlike
the ﬁndings in our mice treated from the age of 14 to 17 weeks.

B–D: 500 mm for B; 120 mm for C;
200 mm for D.

This difference could reﬂect tumor stage or treatment duration. Promotion of tumor invasion and metastasis by VEGF
inhibition has been reported in some studies (6–8, 44) but not
in others (45, 46). In a model of nonmelanoma skin cancer,
inhibition of VEGFR-2 by a blocking antibody stopped angiogenesis and prevented invasion of malignant cells (47). These
effects could depend on multiple factors including tumor stage,
tumor microenvironment, nature, dose, and schedule of the
inhibitor.
Suppression of lymph node metastasis by c-Met
inhibition
Although c-Met was not detected by immunohistochemistry
in normal pancreatic islets and was limited to blood vessels in

vehicle-treated RIP-Tag2 tumors, c-Met immunoreactivity was
widespread in tumor cells, blood vessels, and lymphatics after
treatment with anti-VEGF antibody or sunitinib. c-Met immunoreactivity was also found in tumor cells inside lymphatics
after sunitinib. Treatment with the c-Met-selective RTK inhibitor PF-04217903 reduced tumor invasion, intratumoral lymphatics, and lymph node metastasis in RIP-Tag2 mice treated
with vehicle, anti-VEGF antibody, or sunitinib from the age of
14 to 17 weeks. As the amount of HGF did not change under
these conditions, c-Met activation could be partially ligand
independent (17).
In humans, c-Met is overexpressed, constitutively active,
mutated, or otherwise ampliﬁed in many aggressive tumors
(11, 12), and high c-Met activity is associated with poor

Reduction of Lymph Node Metastasis by c-Met Inhibition

after treatment with sunitinib or anti-VEGF antibody, but cMet staining was not detected in lymphatics of the normal
pancreas and was found in less than half of the lymphatics in
untreated RIP-Tag2 tumors. Similarly, c-Met is strongly
expressed by activated or growing lymphatics at sites of
inﬂammation or wound healing but not in normal skin (19).
The absence of proliferating intratumoral lymphatics after
sunitinib suggests that factors other than lymphangiogenesis
promote the increase in intratumoral lymphatics and lymph
node metastasis. Tumor borders were conspicuously smoother
after treatment with PF-04217903, consistent with an antiinvasive action (8, 60). PF-04217903 could decrease intratumoral lymphatics by reducing tumor invasion into peritumoral
lymphatics and by pruning lymphatics with high c-Met
expression.
Effects of inhibiting c-Met and VEGF signaling together
We previously reported that inhibition of c-Met and VEGF
signaling together reduced liver metastasis and prolonged
survival of RIP-Tag2 mice (8). The present study expands these
actions to include the reduction of lymph node metastasis.
Inhibition of c-Met by PF-04217903 not only reduced lymph
node metastasis when given as a single agent, but also prevented the increase in intratumoral lymphatics, tumor cell
trafﬁcking into lymphatics, and lymph node metastasis that
occurred during treatment with anti-VEGF antibody or sunitinib. Together, the ﬁndings are consistent with the involvement of c-Met signaling in metastasis to liver and lymph nodes
in this model and with the efﬁcacy of blocking c-Met signaling
in reducing metastasis.
In conclusion, inhibition of VEGF signaling by functionblocking antibody or by sunitinib increases intratumoral lymphatics, invasion of tumor cells into lymphatics, and lymph
node metastasis in RIP-Tag2 mice with late-stage tumors. Cooption of existing lymphatics by invading tumor cells is likely to
contribute to the population of intratumoral lymphatics and
perhaps to promotion of lymph node metastasis. Inhibition of
c-Met by PF-04217903 reduces intratumoral lymphatics and
lymph node metastasis under these conditions.

prognosis (14–16). Consistent with c-Met activation, inhibitors
of c-Met signaling, including anti-HGF and anti-c-Met antibodies, soluble decoy receptors, and small molecule RTK
inhibitors, have shown promise, particularly in combination
with inhibitors of VEGF or EGF signaling, in preclinical tumor
models (8, 12, 48–52) and in some clinical trials (53–59).
Multiple mechanisms are likely to be involved in the antimetastatic action of PF-04217903. Many intratumoral and
peritumoral lymphatics had strong c-Met immunoreactivity
