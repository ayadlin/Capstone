ABSTRACT:
Heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) is a molecular chaperone required for the stability
and function of multiple over-expressed signaling proteins that promote growth
and survival in cancer cells. Chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) is characterized
by increased expression of several Hsp90 client proteins making it a potentially
susceptible to Hsp90 inhibition. In this study we showed that the novel Hsp90 inhibitor
NVP-AUY922-AG was cytotoxic to primary CLL cells in vitro (LD50=0.18µM±0.20).
Importantly, its toxicity was preserved under cytoprotective co-culture conditions that
rendered fludarabine ineffective. At the molecular level, NVP-AUY922-AG depleted
the expression of multiple Hsp90 client proteins including Akt and activators of NFκB, IKKα and IKKβ. Consistent with this inhibition profile, NVP-AUY922-AG resulted
in decreased transcription of the NF-B target genes MCL1, CFLAR, BIRC5. In contrast,
fludarabine significantly induced the transcription of MCL1 and BIRC5. Given the
anti-apoptotic nature of these genes and the role they play in fludarabine resistance,
we considered that the combination of NVP-AUY922-AG with fludarabine might
resensitize CLL cells to the effects of fludarabine. In keeping with this hypothesis,
the combination of NVP-AUY922-AG and fludarabine was highly synergistic (mean
CI=0.110.06) and this synergy was enhanced in co-culture (mean CI=0.06±0.08).
Furthermore, the combination maintained the decrease in MCL1, CFLAR and BIRC5
transcription suggesting that the ability of NVP-AUY922-AG to modulate expression of
these genes may contribute to the efficacy of this drug under cytoprotective co-culture
conditions and for its remarkable synergy with fludarabine. Taken together these
findings indicate that Hsp90 inhibition is an attractive therapeutic strategy in CLL.

INTRODUCTION

inhibit CLL cell apoptotic responses to purine analog
chemotherapy through anti-apoptotic signals derived from
CLL cell-stromal cell contact [3]. This microenvironmentderived cytoprotection against chemotherapeutic drugs
likely contributes to treatment failure and relapse in CLL.
Recently published gene expression profiling supports
this view as lymph node-derived CLL cells showed a
profile consistent with enhanced tumor proliferation
and activation of the NF-κB pathway [2]. Other genes,
including the inhibitor of apoptosis Survivin, are induced
by NF-κB signaling via CD40-CD40L interaction [1]
and in vivo Survivin-expressing cells are confined to the
lymph node and pseudo follicles in the bone marrow [1].
Heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) is part of the cellular

B cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is the
most common leukemia in the western world and is
characterized by an accumulation of monoclonal mature
B cells within lymphoid organs, bone marrow and
peripheral blood [1]. Microenvironments within the bone
marrow and lymph nodes play a prominent role in CLL
[1] as proliferation of CLL cells occurs in these centers
[2]. It is now clear that CLL cell survival and activation
is promoted by bone marrow stromal cells, follicular
dendritic cells and T cells in vivo [1]. Furthermore, coculture with bone marrow stromal cells in vitro can

chaperoning machinery that plays a role in maintaining
protein functions including trafficking, post-translational
stability and turnover of its protein substrates (clients)
[4, 5]. Inhibition of Hsp90 function leads to proteasomal
degradation of Hsp90 client proteins [4] and in theory
results in simultaneous blockade of multiple oncogenic
signaling cascades [5]. Cancer cells often contain elevated
levels of Hsp90 [5] but the data on CLL cells is equivocal
since there are conflicting reports on the relative level of
Hsp90 expression in CLL cells and normal peripheral
blood mononuclear cells [6, 7]. However, Hsp90 inhibitors
have previously been shown to have activity in CLL
cells [6] and the resulting toxicity was shown to partly
attributable to the inhibition of NF-κB [8]. NF-κB is
commonly up-regulated in CLL [9] and is maintained, at
least in part, by interactions with the microenvironment
[10]. Furthermore, NF-κB has been shown to be a
therapeutic target in CLL [9, 11] but no specific NF-κB
inhibitors are currently available for the treatment of this
disease.
In this study we assessed the effect of the Hsp90

inhibitor NVP-AUY922-AG, as a single agent and in
combination with fludarabine, on CLL cells under different
cell culture conditions. We examined the effects of Hsp90
inhibition on Hsp90 client proteins and downstream
signaling pathways and evaluated the potential for synergy
with fludarabine.

RESULTS
IL-4 and co-culture with NTL and CD40L cells
reduce spontaneous apoptosis in vitro CLL cell
culture
Previous studies have shown that the addition of
IL-4 to CLL culture enhances in vitro survival by inducing
resistance to apoptosis [12, 13]. In this study we confirmed
that the addition of IL-4 to CLL cell cultures resulted in
a significant reduction in spontaneous apoptosis after 48h
(31.4% to 14.1%, P<0.0001). Co-culture with either NTL

or CD40L cells proved even more cytoprotective for CLL
cells (Figure 1A; P = 0.005 and P = 0.034 respectively);
addition of IL-4 to these co-cultures did not further
enhance the cytoprotection (NTL: P = 0.31, CD40L:
P = 0.07). As a result of these findings, all subsequent
experiments were carried out in suspension cultures
supplemented with IL-4 and in co-culture with NTL and
CD40L cells unless stated otherwise.

three proteins were depleted in CLL cells treated with
NVP-AUY922-AG for 24h in a concentration-dependent
manner (Figure 2). In contrast, MAPK, another Hsp90
client protein, was not substantially decreased at low NVPAUY922-AG concentrations (0.01-0.04µM) suggesting a
degree of selectivity for NVP-AUY922-AG (Figure 2). In
keeping with previous studies, [16, 17] the inhibition of
Hsp90 resulted in an increase in Hsp70 protein expression
(Figure 2). It is worthy of note that Hsp90 itself was
not diminished in our assay system but NVP-AUY922AG inhibits ATPase activity at the N-terminus of Hsp90
thereby promoting client protein dissociation rather than
Hsp90 protein degradation [18].

NVP-AUY922-AG is more potent than
fludarabine and retains toxicity in the presence
of IL-4 and in NTL and CD40L expressing coculture

NVP-AUY922-AG is highly synergistic with
fludarabine

The Hsp90 inhibitor, NVP-AUY922-AG was
almost a log more potent than fludarabine in CLL cells
cultured in suspension without IL-4. The mean LD50 for
the Hsp90 inhibitor NVP-AUY922-AG was 0.18µM ±
0.20 and was 1.16 ± 1.74 for fludarabine. Furthermore,
NVP-AUY922-AG retained its potency against primary
CLL cells even in the presence of IL-4 (Figure 1B, P =
0.43, Table 1.) whereas the cytotoxic effects of fludarabine
were significantly attenuated under these conditions (P =
0.008, Table 1). Furthermore, co-culturing CLL cells with
NTL or CD40L cells completely abrogated the ability
of fludarabine to induce cell death. In contrast, NVPAUY922-AG retained the ability to kill cells under these
cytoprotective conditions (Figure 1C, Table 1, NTL P =
0.85, CD40L P = 0.11). Figure 1D shows a composite
dose-response curve for 3 individual CLL patients. We
went on to confirm that NVP-AUY922-AG-induced
cytotoxicity was mediated via apoptosis and this was
apparent even at concentrations as low as 0.01µM (Figure
1E).

Given that fludarabine-based regimens are the
standard of care for the treatment of CLL [19-21], we
assessed the effects of combining fludarabine with NVPAUY922-AG in vitro. The combination of these drugs
resulted in remarkably strong synergy in the absence
of IL-4 and this was further enhanced by the addition
of IL-4 to the cultures (Figure 3A, mean CI at LD50;
-IL-4 = 0.11±0.06, +IL-4 = 0.06±0.08). Furthermore,
the synergistic interaction between NVP-AUY922AG and fludarabine was observed over a wide range
of concentrations in all the culture conditions tested
(Figure 3B). Given that we have shown that fludarabine
resistance is markedly increased in the presence of IL-4,
it seems likely that the increased synergy seen under these
conditions is promoted, at least in part, by the ability of
NVP-AUY922-AG to reverse IL-4-mediated fludarabine
resistance mechanisms.
In an attempt to investigate the mechanistic basis
of the synergy observed between NVP-AUY922-AG and
fludarabine, we examined the effect of both agents, alone
and in combination, on the expression of AKT, MAPK,
IKKα and IKKβ proteins in CLL cells. Both NVPAUY922-AG and fludarabine reduced the expression
of all four proteins at concentrations employed in the
synergy experiments (Figure 3C). The decrease in these

We went on to investigate the effects of NVPAUY922-AG on number of known pro-survival Hsp90
client proteins AKT, IKKα and IKKβ [8, 14, 15]. All

combined at a constant ratio (1:2) in vitro and the CI calculated
at the ED50 concentration calculated were CI < 1 indicates
synergy between NVP-AUY922-AG and fludarabine. Strongly
synergy between the two drugs was indicated in suspension
culture and in the cytoprotective CD40L expressing culture
conditions. Samples refractory to fludarabine in vitro showed
synergy between the two drugs in all culture conditions. B)
Synergy was shown over a range of concentrations of the drugs
used. In the majority of cases, the level of synergy appeared to
be stronger towards higher ED values. C) NVP-AUY922-AG
and fludarabine result in the depletion of expression of AKT,
MAPK, IKKα and IKKβ proteins. The effect of fludarabine as a
single agent on expression of all four proteins is smaller than that
induced by NVP-AUY922-AG. Combination of Fludarabine and
NVP-AUY922-AG produced a larger decrease in expression of
these proteins enforcing the mechanism of synergy between the
drugs at a molecular level. Quantitation of the level of protein
expression is shown below the relevant blot and is relative to

with fludarabine but was slightly decreased by fludarabine
alone.

Given the inhibitory effects of NVP-AUY922-AG

transcriptionally regulated by NF-κB. In particular we
investigated transcriptional changes in the anti-apoptotic
genes BCL2, MCL1, CFLAR and BIRC5 as well as
the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-1β. We measured the
relative level of target gene mRNA expression, when
compared with the house-keeping gene RPS14, following
treatment of primary CLL cells with NVP-AUY922AG, fludarabine and the combination for 4 hours and 24
hours. Transcription of the short half-life genes MCL1,
CFLAR and BIRC5 were significantly inhibited at 4
hours following treatment with 2µM NVP-AUY922AG and the combination of NVP-AUY922-AG and
fludarabine (Figure 4A). In contrast, treatment with
4µM fludarabine as a single agent did not significantly
reduce the transcription of these genes at the 4-hour
time point. A similar pattern of expression was observed
following exposure to drug for 24 hours; all of the NFκB regulated genes were significantly inhibited following
exposure to NVP-AUY922-AG and the combination

of NVP-AUY922-AG and fludarabine (Figure 4B).
Importantly, exposure to fludarabine alone appeared to
induce the transcription of MCL1 and BIRC5 at 24 hours
consistent with the view that these genes may play a
role in facilitating fludarabine resistance in vitro [1, 22].
Furthermore, the combination of NVP-AUY922-AG and
fludarabine suppressed the fludarabine-mediated induction
of MCL1 and BIRC5. It is therefore conceivable that that
NVP-AUY922-AG-mediated inhibition of anti-apoptotic
genes would increase the sensitivity of primary CLL cells
to the effects of fludarabine in the combination thereby
contributing to the synergy seen with these agents.

when compared to the bone marrow microenvironment
[2] and this is associated with the activation of the NF-κB
pathway. NF-κB target genes are involved in cell-cycle
regulation, inhibition of apoptosis, signal transduction
and chemotaxis [2]. In the lymph node microenvironment
CD40-CD40L interactions between CLL cells and
activated T-cells induces NF-κB, drives CLL cell
proliferation and promotes resistance to chemotherapeutics
[27]. Consequently, recent research has focused on
targeting the microenvironment and the signaling
pathways within CLL cells that it activates [25]. However,
cancer cells are adept at circumventing pharmacological
blockade of individual signaling pathways so the concept
of multiple targeted approaches appears rational (24). In
this context, inhibition of Hsp90 is an attractive possibility
in CLL and other cancers [28-31] as Hsp90 is a molecular
chaperone that acts to ensure the correct folding of
nascent proteins and their maintenance or targeting for
degradation by the proteasome. Inhibition of Hsp90 has
been reported to simultaneously down regulate a number
of client proteins that are involved in signaling pathways
implicated in cancer [28, 31].
Given the importance of microenvironmental
effects on CLL cells, it is increasingly clear that potential
treatments for CLL should be evaluated under conditions

DISCUSSION
CLL is an incurable disease using the standard
therapeutic options currently available [23, 24]. Although
most patients initially respond to chemotherapy, they
invariably relapse and develop drug resistance. There is
growing evidence that resistance arises in the pro-survival
microenvironments found in the lymph nodes and bone
marrow [25] and both cellular and humoral interactions
in these tissue sites likely play a role in this process [26].
Recent evidence suggests that the lymph node interactions
preferentially induce CLL cell activation and proliferation

Figure 4: NF-κB regulated genes are inhibited by NVP-AUY922-AG. Anti-apoptotic genes BCL2, MCL1, CFLAR, BIRC5 and
inflammatory cytokine IL-1β are all regulated by NF-κB. Real-time reverse-transcription PCR was used to measure the relative level of
target gene mRNA expression compared to housekeeping gene RPS14 following treatment with NVP-AUY922-AG, fludarabine and both
in combination. A) 4h of treatment with NVP-AUY922-AG (2µM) and NVP-AUY922-AG with fludarabine significantly inhibited MCL1,
CFLAR and BIRC5. Fludarabine alone did not reduce the mRNA level of these genes. B) MCL1, CFLAR, BIRC5 and IL-1β mRNA levels
were all reduced by 24h treatment with NVP-AUY922-AG or NVP-AUY922-AG and fludarabine in combination. Fludarabine as a single
agent induced mRNA expression of MCL1 and BIRC5. * P < 0.05, ** P < 0.0001.

that mimic these pro-survival niches. Therefore, in this
study we added IL-4 to liquid culture conditions and
used mouse fibroblast co-cultures which promote the upregulation of co-stimulatory and adhesion molecules in
the CLL cells [32]. Both of these approaches significantly
reduced the level of spontaneous apoptosis seen after 48h
[33, 34]. The addition of IL-4 to liquid culture conditions
induced marked resistance to fludarabine. Resistance to
apoptosis induced by fludarabine has previously been
described in CLL cells cultured with CD40L-expressing
cells in the presence of IL-4.[35] The mechanism(s) for
this have not been fully elucidated but the upregulation of
Bcl-2 may well be a contributory factor.[33] In contrast,
NVP-AUY922-AG was equipotent in IL-4 supplemented
cultures suggesting that its mechanism of killing was
distinct from fludarabine. Furthermore, under co-culture
conditions on NTL of CD40L cells fludarabine was even
less cytotoxic whereas NVP-AUY922-AG retained its
cell killing activity. The cell killing activity of NVPAUY922-AG in the co-culture systems is promising
as it suggests that this agent can overcome the survival
signals induced in the CLL cells by interactions with the
microenvironment including CD40-CD40L signaling and
protection by IL-4 [36].
At the molecular level, we demonstrated Hsp90
inhibition resulted in an increase in Hsp70; a finding
consistent with previously published reports of Hsp90
inhibitors.[16, 17] It is worthy of note that the induction of
Hsp70 expression as a result of Hsp90 inhibition may be
problematic as Hsp70 is a cytoprotective protein that can
block both caspase-dependent and caspase-independent
apoptosis, and also autophagic cell death and necrosis
[28]. However, the stability and function of multiple
client proteins are regulated by Hsp90 and these proteins
function as regulators of cell growth, differentiation and
in apoptotic pathways[37]. Consequently, inhibition
of Hsp90 function by NVP-AUY922-AG resulted in
decreased expression of AKT, MAPK, IKKα and IKKβ.
This confirms that inhibition of Hsp90 targets multiple
signaling pathways. [14, 15] Of particular interest is the
inhibition of IKK and IKKβ as these modulate expression
of NF-κB through phosphorylation of IκB leading to IκB
degradation and subsequent release and activation of
NF-κB.[38, 39] NF-κB has been previously shown to be
a prognostic marker and a therapeutic target in CLL [9,
11, 40] and the ability to suppress NF-κB activation in
CLL cells may be critical to the success of a treatment.
We have recently shown that NF-κB activation is higher in
previously treated CLL patients [40], which in turn makes
the cells impervious the effects of other therapies [41].
The most striking finding of this study was the
remarkable cytotoxic synergy seen in CLL cells treated
with NVP-AUY922-AG and fludarabine, particularly in
cytoprotective culture conditions (Figure 3). This synergy
was mirrored at the molecular level as the inhibition of
AKT, IKKα and IKKβ by NVP-AUY922-AG alone
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

was enhanced when NVP-AUY922-AG was used in
combination with fludarabine. Additionally, co-culture of
CLL cells with CD40L-expressing cells results in the upregulation of anti-apoptotic genes including NF-κB target
genes BCL2 and MCL1 [42, 43], CFLAR and BIRC5 [44].
Quantitative PCR analysis showed that NVP-AUY922AG resulted in inhibition of expression of MCL1, CFLAR
and BIRC5 in primary CLL cells (Figure 4). In contrast,
fludarabine induced the transcription of MCL1 and
BIRC5. Importantly, the combination of NVP-AUY922AG and fludarabine resulted in the net transcriptional
repression of these genes perhaps providing a molecular
explanation for the synergy observed.
In conclusion, inhibition of Hsp90 appears to
be an attractive prospective for therapy in CLL as
it targets multiple intracellular signaling pathways
that are preferentially activated in cytoprotective
microenvironments in vivo. Encouragingly, NVPAUY922-AG retained its activity in the presence of such
signals in vitro and showed remarkable synergy with
fludarabine under the same conditions. As such, early
phase trials of this agent, both alone and in combination,
would seem warranted.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell isolation and culture
Lymphocytes from peripheral blood samples from
CLL patients were separated using Ficoll-Hypaque
(Sigma, Poole, UK). Samples were washed in phosphate
buffered saline (PBS) and counted. Patients were
diagnosed using a combination of clinical criteria and
immunophenotyping. Informed consent was obtained in
accordance with the ethical approval obtained from South
East Wales Research Ethics Committee (02/4806) prior
to samples being taken. Separated lymphocytes were
maintained in RPMI medium supplemented with 10% fetal
bovine serum (FBS), penicillin (50U/ml) and streptomycin
(50µg/ml). Where indicated, recombinant human IL-4 (R
and D Systems, Abingdon, UK) (5ng/ml) was added to
the culture medium (5ng/ml). Mouse embryonic fibroblast
L-cells, either non-transfected (NTL) or L-cells expressing
CD40 ligand (CD40L) [45] were used where indicated as
feeder layers.

Toxicity assays
The toxicity of the Hsp90 inhibitor NVP-AUY922AG in primary CLL cells was determined in cells in
suspension culture, on NTL and CD40L feeder layers
over 48h both in the presence and absence of IL-4. NVPAUY922-AG was tested at concentrations between
0.008µM and 50µM. Sensitivity to fludarabine (0.15µM
531

to 10µM) was also measured in the same samples. CLL
cells co-cultured on a feeder layer were pretreated with
NVP-AUY922-AG or fludarabine for 2 hours before being
placed on the feeder layer to preserve the integrity of the
layer and ensure that only the CLL cells were exposed to
drug. Cell viability was assessed by flow cytometry.

culture with IL-4 for 24h at the ratio previously described
were also lyzed and immunoblotted with the same panel of
antibodies. Additionally, cells treated with NVP-AUY922AG on CD40L cells with IL-4 for 24h were also lyzed and
immunoblotted for the same panel of antibodies.

Real-time reverse transcription-PCR

Synergy

Untreated cells and cells treated with NVP-AUY922AG and fludarabine in combination (NVP-AUY922-AG
2.0µM, fludarabine 4.0µM and both drugs at a ratio of
1:2) for 4 and 24h. 5x106 CLL cells were re-suspended
in 1ml Trizol reagent and RNA was extracted using
chloroform and isopropanol. RNA (1 μg) was used in a
20μL reverse transcription (RT) reaction containing 10×
Buffer II, 5 mmol/L MgCl2, 0.5 μmol/L deoxynucleotide
triphosphates, 2.5 units reverse transcriptase, 1 unit RNase
inhibitor, and 2.5 μmol/L random hexamers. cDNA (2
μL) was placed into the RT-PCR reaction. SYBR Green
technology (Roche Diagnostics, Burgess Hill, UK) was
used to quantify the amount of RNA present in each
sample using primer pairs for BCL2, MCL1, CFLAR,
BIRC5, IL-1β and RPS14. All primers were purchased
from Eurogentec Ltd (Southampton, UK). The amount of
mRNA was assessed using real-time RT-PCR using the
LightCycler System (Roche Diagnostics). The amount of
RPS14 mRNA was quantified in all samples as an internal
house-keeping control, and the results of the real-time RTPCR were expressed as normalized target gene values (e.g.
the ratio between BCL2 and RPS14 transcripts calculated
from the crossing points of each gene). All experiments
were performed in duplicate. Total RNA was amplified
using the following primers:
BCL2: 5′-aagattgatgggatcgttgc-3′ (forward) and
5′-tgtgctttgcattcttggac-3′ (reverse);
MCL1: 5′-aaaagcaagtggcaagagga-3′ (forward) and
5′-ttaatgaattcggcgggtaa-3′ (reverse);
CFLAR: 5′-gtggagacccacctgctca-3′ (forward)
and 5′-ggacacatcagatttatccaaatcc-3′ (reverse);
BIRC5: 5′-ttagcagaaaatgcactccag-3′ (forward) and
5′-ctggttttaaggatggccttt-3′ (reverse);
IL-1β: 5′-tggcagaaagggaacagaaa-3′ (forward) and
5′-acttcttgccccctttgaat-3′ (reverse);
RPS14: 5′-ggcagaccgagatgaactct-3′ (forward) and
5′-ccaggtccaggggtcttggt-3′ (reverse).

Synergy between NVP-AUY922-AG and fludarabine
was tested in suspension culture (± IL-4) and on CD40L
cells (with IL-4) over 48h. A constant molar ratio of
NVP-AUY922-AG 1:2 fludarabine was used based on
the relative activities of both agents determined in the
preceding toxicity experiments. Concentrations used were
NVP-AUY922-AG (0.001 to 50µM) and fludarabine
(0.002 to 100µM). Cell death was assessed on an Accuri
C6 flow cytometer (BD Accuri Cytometers, Ann Arbor,
MI, USA). Synergy was calculated according to the
median effect method using CalcuSyn software [46].

Annexin V positivity
CLL lymphocytes treated with NVP-AUY922-AG
(0.01, 0.02, 0.04, 2.0 and 4.0µM) for 48h were tested
for annexin V positivity using an Annexin V apoptosis
detection kit (Axxora Ltd, Matford Court, UK) according
to the manufacturer’s instructions. Untreated cells were
used a control. Cells treated with NVP-AUY922-AG were
maintained in suspension culture with IL-4.

Immunoblotting
Equal numbers of cells (5 x 106 cells) treated
with NVP-AUY922-AG (0, 0.01, 0.02 and 0.04µM) in
suspension culture with IL-4 for 24h were washed with
PBS and lyzed by resuspension in lysis buffer (HEPES
50mM, sodium fluoride 5mM, iodoacetamide 5mM,
sodium chloride 75mM, NP40 1%, PMSF 1mM, sodium
orthovanadate 1mM, protease inhibitors (Sigma) 1%,
phospatase inhibitor cocktail 2 (Sigma) 1%, phosphatase
inhibitor cocktail 3 (Sigma) 1%) for 30 minutes at 4oC
followed by centrifugation at 16 000 x g. Clarified lyzates
were subjected to electrophoresis using NuPage precast
4-12% Bis-Tris gels (Invitrogen, Paisley, UK) followed
by transfer to PVDF membranes (GE Healthcare UK Ltd,
Little Chalfont, UK). Immunoblotting was performed with
antibodies to Hsp90, Akt, mitogen-activated protein kinase
(MAPK), IκB kinase α (IKKα), IκB kinase β (IKKβ)
(New England Biolabs (UK) Ltd, Hitchin, UK), Hsp70
(Millipore (UK) Ltd, Watford, UK), Tubulin (Abcam,
Cambridge, UK). Cells treated with NVP-AUY922-AG
and fludarabine in combination (NVP-AUY922-AG 0.02
and 0.04µM, fludarabine 2.0 and 4.0 µM) in suspension
