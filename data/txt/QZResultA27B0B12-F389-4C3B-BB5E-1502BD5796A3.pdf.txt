ABSTRACT
Neuroblastoma is the most common extracranial solid tumor during infancy and
childhood.
Outcome of high-risk and late-stage disease remains poor despite intensive
treatment regimens.
Suppressing inhibitor of apoptosis proteins (IAPs) using Smac mimetics (SM)
significantly sensitizes neuroblastoma (NB) cells for chemotherapy, however strongly
dependent on the cytotoxic drug combined with SM.
Therefore, a systematic analysis of the impact of SM in combination with different
classes of chemotherapeutics was of crucial importance. Treatment of NB cell lines
with SM LCL161 and vinca alkaloids revealed a strong synergistic inhibition of
proliferation and significant induction of apoptosis in virtually all established and de
novo NB cell lines (n=8).
In contrast, combination of anthracyclines or topoisomerase inhibitors with
LCL161 showed a synergism for single drugs and/or cell lines only.
Furthermore, we could show that insensibility to LCL161-mediated sensitization
for chemotherapeutics is associated with aberrant activation of anaplastic lymphoma
kinase (ALK) by common mutation F1174L. Inhibition of ALK using TAE684 is able
to overcome this resistance in a synergistic fashion, a finding that could be highly
relevant for improvement of neuroblastoma therapy.

INTRODUCTION

apoptotic machinery is one of the hallmarks of cancer
contributing to development and expansion of diverse
malignancies [6].
The family of inhibitor of apoptosis proteins (IAP)
are essential regulators of apoptosis. X-linked IAP (XIAP),
the most prominent and best-analyzed IAP, is increased
in different cancers including neuroblastoma contributing
to chemotherapy resistance and unfavorable outcome [710]. Caspase activation essential for apoptosis induction
is inhibited by direct binding of XIAP to caspases-3/-7/-9
[11]. Second mitochondria-derived activator of caspase
(Smac) is released from the mitochondria in response
to different apoptotic stimuli. IAPs are antagonized by
interaction of their BIR2 and BIR3 domains with the
AVPI tetrapeptide motif of Smac [12]. Using this motif
as a blue print for the development of small molecule IAP
antagonists (Smac mimetics) has shown to be a promising

Neuroblastoma is a malignant disease of the
sympathetic nervous system and the most prevalent
solid extracranial tumor during infancy and childhood.
Prognosis for non-high risk disease is good with 5-year
survival > 90%, at the same time more than 50% of
patients suffer from metastatic disease at time of diagnosis
[1, 2]. Outcome for these patients is still poor in spite
of significant therapy improvements in the last years
including differentiation therapy or immunotherapy [3].
Development of novel treatment options is therefore
absolutely essential and a key objective in pediatric
oncology [4, 5].

is necessary to eradicate impaired cells and to enable

strategy for treatment of malignancies associated with
XIAP overexpression.
Smac mimetics (SM) were able to induce
apoptosis and to significantly increase efficacy of classic
treatment in several experimental cancer models [10,
13]. In neuroblastoma cell lines we could demonstrate
a sensitization against cytotoxic drugs currently used
in neuroblastoma therapy in vitro and in a syngeneic
mouse model using SM LBW242 and LCL161 [7].
LBW242 and LCL161 are structural analogs with similar
molecular weight; the latter was optimized for potency and
pharmacokinetics [14]. Several clinical trials are currently
conducted to evaluate the capacity of Smac mimetics for
the treatment of resistant malignant diseases [15].
Sensitization of neuroblastoma cells for
chemotherapy using SM was highly synergistic for
vincristine, in part synergistic for doxorubicin and
antagonistic for etoposide [7].
If the synergistic interaction of SM is drugdependent or related to the molecular background of the
neuroblastoma cells is still unanswered.
Therefore, a systematic effect analysis of different
classes of antineoplastic drugs in combination with SM
was the logical next step to shed light on this relevant
issue. In the current study, we could show that in all except
one of the tested neuroblastoma cell lines vinca alkaloids
(vinblastine, vindesine and vincristine) with SM LCL161
displayed a strong synergistic effect on proliferation and
a significant apoptosis induction in line with the results
obtained before. Using anthracyclines (daunorubicin,
doxorubicin and idarubicin) or topoisomerase inhibitors
(etoposide, topotecan and SN‑38) in contrast a synergism
with LCL161 was detectable for single drugs and/or cell
lines only.

degradation of cIAP-1 respectively [10, 18-20]. Therefore
we determined the abundance of cIAP-1 and XIAP protein
in neuroblastoma cell lines (n = 6) using Western blot
analysis (Figure 1A). Slight differences in expression
levels for cIAP-1 and two specific XIAP protein bands
were observed. We have demonstrated cIAP-1 degradation
and constant XIAP expression in neuroblastoma cells
following treatment with SM LBW242 [7]. Treatment of
cells using LCL161 for 30 min showed a similar picture
(Figure 1B).
Then we evaluated proliferation and apoptosis
induction of human neuroblastoma cell lines (n = 6) in
the presence of SM LCL161 monotherapy. Significant
inhibition of proliferation was detected using high
micromolar concentrations with IC50 of 49.4‑77.9
µM (Figure 1C and Table 1A). For all following
experiments concerning combinations of LCL161
with chemotherapeutic drugs a concentration of 10 µM
LCL161 was used. With this concentration only marginal
effects on proliferation and apoptosis induction of the
tested neuroblastoma cell lines were observed (Figure 1D).

Effects of combination of LCL161 with vinca
alkaloids on cellular proliferation
Treatment of neuroblastoma cell lines with vinca
alkaloids (vinblastine, vincristine and vindesine) showed
a concentration-dependent inhibition of proliferation
(Figure 2 and Table 1A). Vinblastine was the most potent
vinca drug with IC50 of 3.7-16.4 nM followed by vindesine
(IC50 9.1-121 nM) and vincristine (IC50 24.5-117 nM).
Combined treatment of LCL161 with each of the vinca
alkaloids enhanced the antiproliferative potential of the
drugs in a synergistic manner in all cell lines except SKN-BE(2)-M17 (Figure 2 and Tables 1A+1B). In this cell
line only vindesine and LCL161 interacted synergistically.

RESULTS
Smac mimetic LBW242 displayed a synergistic
gain of chemotherapy on neuroblastoma cell lines
in a drug-dependent manner [7]. Different classes of
chemotherapeutics used in neuroblastoma therapy were
thus selected for a systematic analysis of their combination
effect with Smac mimetics (SM). LCL161, a structural
analog of LBW242, was used for this survey because it is
well tolerated in humans and mice [16, 17], and showed
synergistic cooperation with vincristine in neuroblastoma
in vivo as well [7]. Furthermore, LCL161 is currently
evaluated in several clinical trials (www.clinicaltrials.gov).

Antiproliferative effects of LCL161 co-treatment
with anthracyclines
Inhibition of cellular proliferation with
anthracyclines disclosed a relative insensibility in
comparison to treatment with vinca alkaloids (Figure 3
and Table 1A). Idarubicin induced the strongest decrease
of cellular growth with IC50 of 42-223 nM. The IC50 of
the other two anthracyclines were 0.35-1.58 µM for
daunorubicin and 0.12-2.58 µM for doxorubicin. Addition
of LCL161 enhanced the negative effect on proliferation
of daunorubicin and doxorubicin in all cell lines, except
Kelly, synergistically (Figures 3A+3B and Tables 1A+1B).
Co-treatment of LCL161 with idarubicin showed a
synergism only in the cell lines NB1691luc and SK‑N‑AS
(Figure 3C and Tables 1A+1B).

LCL161 and topoisomerase inhibitor-induced
inhibition of proliferation

elicited a synergism only for single drugs or cells similar
to the results obtained before (Figures S2B+S2C and
Tables 1A+1B).

Five of the six tested cell lines with exception of
SK-N-SH (IC50 0.54 µM) were unresponsive against
etoposide with IC50 of 4.6‑29.1 µM (Figure 4A and Table
1A).
In contrast proliferation of neuroblastoma cell lines
treated with topoisomerase inhibitors SN-38 (IC50 0.0131.56 µM) and topotecan (IC50 0.08-1.17 µM) was inhibited
to a similar degree (Figures 4B+4C and Table 1A).
Application of LCL161 had marginal effects on
the antiproliferative impact of topoisomerase inhibitors.
Only in the cell line SK-N‑AS addition of LCL161
resulted in a synergistic topotecan-induced inhibition of
proliferation (Figure 4C and Tables 1A+1B). In all other
cell lines LCL161 was not able to substantially increase
the inhibition of proliferation of either etoposide, SN‑38
or topotecan leading to additive/antagonistic effects or
only slight to moderate synergism (Figure 4 and Tables
1A+1B).

Apoptosis induction by anthracyclines and
LCL161

In order to validate that the preceding observations
were not restricted to long-term cultivated cell lines
proliferation assays were expanded to low passage de
novo neuroblastoma cell lines HGW-1 and HGW-3. Both
were highly sensitive for chemotherapy in general and
combination with LCL161 induced effects comparable to
that of the established neuroblastoma cell lines (Figures
S1 and S2 and Tables 1A+1B). Again, the inhibition of
proliferation induced by all vinca alkaloids could be
increased by LCL161 leading to (strong) synergism
(Figure S2A and Tables 1A+1B). Combinations of
LCL161 with anthracyclines or topoisomerase inhibitors

Neuroblastoma cell lines were treated with
LCL161 in combination with anthracyclines to evaluate
the effects on apoptosis induction (Figures 6A-6C).
In all cell lines beside Kelly a significant increase in
apoptosis was observed by application of LCL161 to
daunorubicin correlating with the synergisms observed in
the proliferation assays (Figure 6A). A similar pattern was
detected for doxorubicin (Figure 6B).
However, unexpectedly no obvious differences in
apoptosis were found for doxorubicin and its combination
with LCL161 in SK-N-BE(2)-M17 that displayed a
synergistic (CI(IC50) 0.63) inhibition of proliferation in the

With the intention to shed light on the sensitization
for vinca alkaloid-induced inhibition of proliferation by
LCL161, cells were analyzed for apoptosis induction
using flow cytometry. According to the proliferation
experiments combined treatment of LCL161 with vinca
alkaloids resulted in a considerable increase of apoptosis
in all cell lines except SK‑N‑BE(2)‑M17 (Figures 5A-5C).
In four respectively five of the six cell lines a significant
sensitization for vinblastine- and vincristine-induced
apoptosis by LCL161 was observed (Figures 5A+5B).
In line with the proliferation data all cell lines were
susceptible for the combined treatment of vindesine and
LCL161 leading to a significant increase of apoptotic cells
(Figure 5C).

combination treatment. Add-on of LCL161 to idarubicin
had no significant effect in the cell lines Kelly, SK-NBE(2)-M17 and SK‑N‑SH and only a low increase in
apoptosis was seen in the cell line SH-EP TET21N (Figure
6C). In SK‑N‑AS and NB1691luc LCL161 augmented the
idarubicin-induced apoptosis thus affirming the synergism
detected before (Figure 6C).

SK-N-SH directly influences chemotherapeutic drugs
and their interaction with LCL161 [26]. Proliferation of
neuroblastoma cell lines (n = 6) was efficiently inhibited
using a low micromolar range of TAE684 (IC50 0.125.37 µM, Figure 8B and Table S1A). No significant
differences were observed between ALKwt and ALKF1174L
cells. For subsequent experiments TAE684 was used
at a concentration of 1 nM, inducing no relevant
antiproliferative effects.
Doxorubicin, as one of the standard drugs used
in neuroblastoma chemotherapy, was selected for
evaluating if ALK inhibition influences the combination
of chemotherapy with Smac mimetic LCL161. Cellular
proliferation was suppressed by TAE684 in all cell
lines leading to enhanced doxorubicin-induced growth
inhibition (Figure 8C and Table S1A). Combination
of LCL161 with doxorubicin induced a synergistic
antiproliferative effect in all cell lines with ALKwt. Cell
lines harboring mutation ALKF1174L were again less
susceptible and showed no synergism (Figures 8C+8D and
Tables S1A+S1B).
Simultaneous inhibition of ALK with TAE684 in
doxorubicin and LCL161-treated cells had a relevant
effect only in ALKF1174L cells (Figure 8C and Table
S1A). In all three ALKF1174L cell lines TAE684 caused a
strong increase in inhibition of proliferation leading to
a significant decrease of the CI(IC50) to the synergistic
range (Figure 8D and Table S1B). In contrast, TAE684
only marginally influenced the impact of doxorubicin and
LCL161 in cells with ALKwt and thus no relevant changes
of the CI(IC50) were observed (Figures 8C+8D and Tables
S1A+S1B).
ALKF1174L SH-EP TET21N cells were most
susceptible for TAE684-treatment and were therefore
analyzed for apoptosis induction. Treatment with 1
nM TAE684 had only marginal effects on apoptosis. In
contrast, the effect of combined doxorubicin and LCL161
was significantly reinforced by TAE684. This was
reflected by an increase of early (Annexin V positive) and
late apoptotic (Annexin V and propidium iodide positive)
cells (Figure 8E).
These findings show that TAE684-induced
inhibition of activated ALK (ALKF1174L) in neuroblastoma
not only is effective to increase the effect of chemo drugs
but also is able to synergistically interact with Smac
mimetic LCL161. The latter is highly relevant for cells
that are resistant for combination of either TAE684 or
LCL161 with chemotherapy.

Topoisomerase inhibitor-induced apoptosis is only
marginally increased by LCL161
LCL161 had only minor influence on topoisomerase
inhibitor-induced inhibition of cellular proliferation of
NB cell lines. Therefore, it was of interest if apoptosis
induction of this drug class can be increased by
combination with SM. Only in the cell line SK‑N‑AS
LCL161 was able to significantly increase the induced
apoptosis of all topoisomerase inhibitors in line with
the proliferation assays (Figures 7A-7C). In the cell line
SK‑N‑BE(2)‑M17 the effects of etoposide and SN-38
were significantly increased by LCL161 for some of the
used drug concentrations (Figures 7A+7B).

of

Molecular aberrations in neuroblastoma including
amplification of MYCN, deletions of chromosome arm
1p (del1p) or mutations in p53 or anaplastic lymphoma
kinase (ALK) are commonly found in advanced stage
or relapsed tumors and are associated with an adverse
outcome [21-25]. Therefore, it would be highly relevant
to elucidate if and how these alterations (Table 2) could
have an influence on sensitization of neuroblastoma cell
lines for chemotherapy by LCL161.
For this reason, genetic features of NB cell lines
were correlated to combination index (CI) scores
reflecting synergistic (CI < 1) or additive/antagonistic (CI
≥ 1) interaction of chemotherapeutic drugs with LCL161
(Tables 1B and 2).
Using the Mann‑Whitney U test it became evident
that status of MYCN, deletion of chromosome arm 1p or
mutated p53 could not account for significant differences
between groups (data not shown). In contrast, in cell
lines with activating mutation of ALK (ALKF1174L) a
significantly higher CI than in ALKwt cells was observed
for LCL161 and its combination with idarubicin (CI(IC50)
1.1 vs. 0.76, p = 0.05) or SN-38 (CI(IC50) 0.94 vs. 0.8, p
= 0.05) (Figure 8A). The largest CI difference (ALKF1174L
vs. ALKwt) was detectable for doxorubicin and LCL161
(CI(IC50) 0.8 vs. 0.46, p = 0.127).

However, general synergism was only achieved with
vincristine.
Using a panel of NB cell lines (n = 8) and 3 drugs
of each class of chemotherapeutics it became apparent
that vinca alkaloids generally showed a synergism and
significant increase in apoptosis induction with SM
LCL161 (Tables 1A+1B and Figures 2, 5 and S2). Vinca
alkaloids are antimitotic agents that at high concentrations

www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

(e.g. 10-100 nM in HeLa cells) prevent microtubules to
polymerize thereby impede the formation of the spindle
apparatus necessary for cell division [27].
In contrast, taxanes and other antimitotic agents
stabilize microtubules and thus arrest the mitotic process
[28].
Further analysis disclosed an activation of the
NF-κB pathway by vinca alkaloids and a reduced vinca

pathway was impeded. NF-κB signaling is involved in
the regulation of a manifold of cellular processes and has
shown to either induce or block apoptosis dependent on
the cellular context [29].
Modulation of NF-κB signaling by vinca
alkaloids might be one explanation why these class of
chemotherapeutics showed such a remarkable potency if
combined with Smac mimetics.
Apoptosis induction by SM originally was thought
to be solely mediated by direct binding to XIAP and
abrogation of its inhibition of caspase activation [10].
Recently the degradation of cIAP-1/-2 and the subsequent
activation of NF-κB and induction of TNF‑α was proposed
as the main molecular effect of SM in tumor cells [1820]. TNF-α was found to be crucial for synergism of SM
with chemotherapy by activating the extrinsic apoptotic
pathway [30].
Nevertheless, this model does not seem to be
generally valid for neuroblastoma as we could show that
neuroblastoma cells were sensitized by SM LBW242
independent of TNF-α [7]. Apoptosis induction in
neuroblastoma cell lines using SM BV6 recently has
also been demonstrated to be independent of TNF-α
signaling [31] Additionally there is evidence that other
pathways involving RIP1 could be crucial for SMmediated sensitization for chemotherapy as well [32].
In neuroblastoma RIP1 has shown to be required for
apoptosis induction only for the combination of BV6 and
doxorubicin but not for BV6 and vincristine [31]. This
was explained by activation of different initial cellular
programs by the used drug.

SM LBW242 synergistically increased impact of
treatment of neuroblastoma with the anthracycline drug
doxorubicin in three of four cell lines [7].
We now showed that the anthracyclines
daunorubicin and doxorubicin synergistically interacted
with LCL161 in all except one cell line (Tables 1A+1B
and Figures 3A+3B). In contrast, with idarubicin only in
two cell lines a synergism was detectable (Tables 1A+1B
and Figure 3C).
The mechanisms of action that are responsible
for cell death induction by anthracyclines are still
ambiguous. DNA intercalation leading to inhibition of
DNA transcription and replication and more relevant
poisoning of topoisomerase II leading to aggregation of
damaged DNA, G1/G2 cell cycle arrest and apoptosis
were described for anthracyclines to name just a few [3335].
Cytotoxic eviction of histones and formation of free
radicals are other mechanism that obviously are relevant
for the anti-tumor effects of anthracyclines [36-38].
The high homology between doxorubicin and
daunorubicin, which only differ in a hydroxy group, most
likely accounts for the similar effects that were observed
in combination with LCL161. Idarubicin is derived from
daunorubicin by elimination of a methoxy group resulting
in an increased lipophility and better uptake into the cell
[39].
SM LBW242-treatment did not significantly
increase topoisomerase inhibitor etoposide-induced
inhibition of proliferation in neuroblastoma cell lines
[7]. Combination of SM LCL161 with etoposide, SN-38
72648

Oncotarget

or topotecan now indicated a predominant insensitivity
against topoisomerase inhibitors, if compared with
clinically reachable concentrations, that can be overcome
by LCL161 only in a minority of the cells (Tables 1A+1B
and Figures 2, 6 and S2).
Drug resistance during recurrent disease is a major
problem in the treatment of cancer [40].
For etoposide it was demonstrated that
neuroblastoma cell lines obtained at time of diagnosis
were sensitive for etoposide but that resistance obviously
was acquired during progressive disease or if disease
relapsed [41].
With this in mind it is not surprising that the IC50
(4.6-29.1 µM) of almost all (7 of 8) tested NB cell lines
were much higher as the achievable plasma steady-state
concentration of ~12 µM (7 µg/ml) as only one cell line
was established before therapy [42].
A comparable pattern of resistance was seen for
SN‑38 (IC50 13 nM-1.56 µM vs. C­max of 56 nM (22 ng/
ml)) [43] and topotecan (IC50 80 nM-1.17 µM vs. C­max
of 209 nM (88 ng/ml)) [44]. Cross-resistance of SN-38
and topotecan with etoposide is another problem that
was observed after intensive chemotherapy and use of
topoisomerase inhibitors during recurrent disease was thus
not suggested [45].
The use of Smac mimetics in contrast could
nevertheless be a promising strategy to overcome
topoisomerase inhibitor resistance in some cases. The cell
line SK-N-AS disclosed triple resistance against etoposide
(IC50 26.7 µM), SN-38 (IC50 0.53 µM) and topotecan (IC50
0.78 µM) but all drugs showed a synergism with LCL161.
This synergism lowered the IC50 to 20.4 µM for etoposide,
to 0.38 µM for SN-38 and to 0.22 µM for topotecan.
As these concentrations are only clinically achievable
for topotecan, it would however have relevant clinical
implications to find molecular markers that are causal for
these findings.
Systematical analysis of susceptibility of different
drug classes for LCL161 revealed a so far unknown
association with mutation of ALK (ALKF1174L).
Interestingly, other molecular aberrations like MYCN
status did not influence impact of LCL161. Point
mutations activating the ALK tyrosine kinase domain were
found in familial and sporadic neuroblastomas with high
frequency [26, 46-48].
In neuroblastoma the most common and aggressive
modified ALK variant (ALKF1174L) is necessary for
cellular proliferation and survival [26]. Furthermore,
ALKF1174L targeted expression has been demonstrated to
be tumorigenic in mice inducing neuroblastomas that
resemble the human disease [49]. Transgenic ALKF1174L
mice were dependent on ALKF1174L activity as treatment
with ALK inhibitor TAE684 induced a complete tumor
regression.
Consequently, we could show that inhibition of ALK
using TAE684 induces a significant decrease in cellular
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

proliferation of neuroblastoma cell lines (Figure 8B).
For the first time we demonstrated that SM LCL161
positively interacted with TAE684 (Figures 8C+8D), while
exhibiting minor effects only together with doxorubicin in
ALKF1174L cells (Figures 3B and 8C+8D).
Combined inhibition of ALK using TAE684
however was able to overcome LCL161-resistance leading
to a synergistic inhibition of cell growth (Figures 8C+8D).
In contrast, in ALKwt cells the effects of LCL161 and
doxorubicin were not significantly increased by TAE684.
This is in line with other findings that showed a
stronger impact of TAE684 on ALKF1174L than ALKwt
[26, 50]. Activated ALK controls a manifold of
pathways including phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI3K)
signaling [51]. Activated PI3K in turn activates Akt that
is directly involved in regulation of apoptosis. XIAP
phosphorylation by Akt protects XIAP from cisplatininduced ubiquitination and degradation thus preventing
apoptosis induction [52]. In pancreatic cancer cells, which
were resistant for SM AZD5582, knockdown of Akt using
RNAi sensitized them for AZD5582 [53]. Moreover,
extent of AZD5582-induced apoptosis was dependent on
the expression levels of p-Akt and p‑XIAP.
Taken together a hypothesis evolves that would give
a molecular basis for the observed synergism of TAE684
and LCL161 in ALKF1174L neuroblastoma. Elevated
XIAP levels and XIAP stabilization by ALKF1174L/
PI3K/Akt-mediated phosphorylation would potentially
confer a strong resistance against apoptotic stimuli. On
this background, inhibition of ALK by TAE684 would
destabilize XIAP by preventing its phosphorylation by
Akt. LCL161-treatment would disturb XIAP interaction
and inhibition of caspases. Both TAE684 and LCL161
have the potential to induce apoptosis but are especially
effective in supporting other apoptotic stimuli. In
combination, their impact on XIAP is further increased
leading to a considerable gain of chemotherapy.
In summary, ALK inhibition together with SM
LCL161 could be a highly effective option to significantly
augment chemotherapy by synergistically suppressing
inhibitor of apoptosis proteins.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell lines and cell culture
Neuroblastoma cell lines Kelly, NB1691luc, SHEP TET21N, SK-N-AS, SK‑N‑BE(2)‑M17 and SKN-SH as well as recently established de novo cell lines
HGW-1 and HGW-3 (kindly provided by Holger Lode;
University Medicine Greifswald) [54] were used. The
SH-EP TET21N system is a conditional, tetracyclineregulated MYCN expression system established in the
SH-EP neuroblastoma cell line [55]. NB1691luc are
72649

Oncotarget

luciferase-expressing, zeocin-resistant NB1691 cells [56].
Neuroblastoma cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 or
IMDM medium (HGW‑1 and HGW-3) supplemented
with 10-20% fetal bovine serum (both Life Technologies,
Darmstadt, Germany), penicillin/streptomycin (10.000
U/ml / 10.000 g/ml, Biochrom, Berlin, Germany) and
zeocin (100 µg/ml; NB1691luc). All cells were cultivated
at 37°C, 5% CO2-atmosphere and a relative humidity of
95%.

added to the cells for an incubation period of 48 hours.
Following incubation with WST-1 for 2 hours, absorbance
was measured with an ELISA reader. IC50 values were
determined using in-house software (Microsoft Excel).

Detection of apoptosis by flow cytometry
Cells were seeded in cell culture medium in 24well plates to adhere overnight. Cells were treated with
the indicated reagents for 48 h. Cells were harvested,
washed twice with PBS and resuspended in Annexin V
binding buffer (10 mM Hepes, 140 mM NaCl, and 0.25
mM CaCl2). Apoptosis was detected by Annexin V-FITC
(556419; BD Pharmingen, Heidelberg, Germany) and
propidium-iodide (PI) (1 mg/ml in ddH2O; Invitrogen,
Darmstadt, Germany) staining and flow cytometry.

Chemical compounds, biological reagents and
drugs
Novartis Pharma generously provided Smac
mimetic LCL161. Cytostatic drugs daunorubicin,
doxorubicin, etoposide, idarubicin, topotecan, SN-38
(active metabolite of irinotecan), vinblastine, vincristine
and vindesine were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich
(Munich, Germany). NVP-TAE684 was purchased from
Selleckchem (Munich, Germany). Working solutions were
prepared by dilution of drugs with medium or ddH2O to
designated concentrations.

Statistical analysis
Combination indices (CI) for cellular proliferation
assays were calculated using the Chou-Talay method to
determine synergism (CI ≤ 0.9), additivity (CI > 0.9-1.1),
or antagonism (CI > 1.1), if combining LCL161 with
cytostatic drugs [57]. The CI was calculated according to
the classic isobologram equation: CI = (d1/D1) + (d2/D2),
where D1 and D2 represent the required doses of drug 1
and 2 to produce x% effect and d1 and d2 the required
doses of drug 1 and 2 to produce the same effect if used
in combination. Statistical significance of differences
between experimental groups was determined using the
Student t-test or the Mann-Whitney U test. A two tailed
p‑value ≤ 0.05 was regarded as significant.

Protein extraction and Western blot analysis
Cell
lysates
were
prepared
with
radioimmunoprecipitation assay (RIPA) buffer (SigmaAldrich) supplemented with Complete protease inhibitor
cocktail and PhosSTOP - Phosphatase Inhibitor Cocktail
(Roche). Standard procedures for Western blotting were
followed using the following primary antibodies: cIAP1 (AF8181; R&D), XIAP (610762; BD Biosciences) and
β-actin (A1978; Sigma-Aldrich). Specific protein bands
were visualized using IRDye 680RD or 800CW secondary
antibodies (LI-COR) and LI‑COR Odyssey infrared
imaging system.
