Abstract

Author Manuscript

Deregulation in lysine methylation signaling has emerged as a common etiologic factor in cancer
pathogenesis, with inhibitors of several histone lysine methyltransferases (KMTs) being developed
as chemotherapeutics1. The largely cytoplasmic KMT SMYD3 (SET and MYND domain
containing protein 3) is overexpressed in numerous human tumors2-4. However, the molecular
mechanism by which SMYD3 regulates cancer pathways and its relationship to tumorigenesis in
vivo are largely unknown. Here we show that methylation of MAP3K2 by SMYD3 increases MAP
Kinase signaling and promotes the formation of Ras-driven carcinomas. Using mouse models for
pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) and lung adenocarcinoma (LAC), we found that
abrogating SMYD3 catalytic activity inhibits tumor development in response to oncogenic Ras.
We employed protein array technology to identify the MAP3K2 kinase as a target of SMYD3. In
cancer cell lines, SMYD3-mediated methylation of MAP3K2 at lysine 260 potentiates activation
of the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK signaling module. Finally, the PP2A phosphatase complex, a key
negative regulator of the MAP Kinase pathway, binds to MAP3K2 and this interaction is blocked

cytoplasmic kinase-signaling cascades and establish a pivotal role for SMYD3 in the regulation of
oncogenic Ras signaling.

The Ras family of oncogenes is activated in a large fraction of human cancers5. To explore
possible connections between KMTs and human cancers driven by activation of Ras, we
surveyed the level of expression for 54 known and candidate human KMT genes in pancreas
ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), a cancer nearly universally initiated by oncogenic Ras
mutations. We found that five KMTs (SMYD3, MLL5, EZH2, SETD5 and WHSC1L1) were
consistently up-regulated in human datasets (Extended Data Fig. 1a-c). SMYD3, which
showed the most significant correlation with PDAC in our meta-analysis, is reported to be
overexpressed in several cancers with elevated Ras activity2,3, and SMYD3 protein
expression increases with PDAC development (Extended Data Fig. 2a-b). Based on these
results, we postulated that SMYD3 might have a role in Ras-driven tumorigenesis.

Little is known regarding SMYD3 cancer-related function in vivo. We previously generated
Smyd3 mutant mice, which develop normally, are viable, and fertile (Extended Data Fig. 2d;
data not shown;6). To investigate the role of SMYD3 in Ras-driven cancers, Smyd3 mutant
mice were crossed with mice harbouring a loxP-Stop-loxP KrasG12D knock-in allele
(Kras+/LSL-G12D), which allows for the controlled induction of oncogenic K-Ras and the
initiation of tumors in distinct organs, including the lung and the pancreas7,8. PDAC arises
from the transdifferentiation of acinar cells into duct-like cells upon activation of Ras
signaling9,10. We observed induction of SMYD3 expression during this process in mice with
pancreas-specific activation of K-Ras (Fig. 1a) and in an ex vivo acinar-to-ductal metaplasia
(ADM) system11 (Fig. 1b). In this assay, SMYD3 was required for efficient duct formation
from acinar cells (Fig. 1c-d). In vivo, ADM and PDAC initiation are triggered in young Kras
mutant mice by inducing severe acute pancreatitis via repeated injections of caerulein12
(Fig. 1e). In this system, Smyd3 deletion reduced the appearance of pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PanIN) brought on by Kras activation, as determined by
histopathological analysis and decreased signal for both phosphorylated ERK1/2 (pERK1/2,
a downstream marker of Ras activity) and MUC5 (a marker of PanINs) (Fig. 1f-g). In the
absence of a pancreatitis trigger, PanIN lesions develop by 6 months in
p48+/Cre;Kras+/LSL-G12D mice8, a process that was attenuated by Smyd3 loss (Fig. 1h;
Extended Data Fig. 3a). Next, to study PDAC growth and to perform survival studies, we
used the p48+/Cre;Kras+/LSL-G12D;p53lox/lox (Kras;p53) mutant model, which is
characterized by rapid PanIN-to-PDAC progression and malignant transformation with
100% penetrance in a relatively short latency (∼50-60 days)13. At autopsy, the pancreatic
tissue from Kras;p53 mutant mice was entirely occupied by transformed cells, whereas areas
of normal pancreatic tissue remained in Kras;p53;Smyd3 mutant mice (Extended Data Fig.
3b-c). Furthermore, loss of Smyd3 extended the lifespan of the animals (Fig. 1i) and resulted
in reduced levels of the PDAC biomarker pERK1/2 in biopsy samples (Fig. 1j; Extended
Data Fig. 3b). Notably, Ras expression was not affected by SMYD3 deletion (Extended
Data Fig. 3f). Based on these data, we conclude that SMYD3 is required for efficient
initiation of pancreatic cancer by oncogenic K-Ras.

Oncogenic activation of the Ras pathway is a frequent event in lung adenocarcinoma, a
cancer that also shows high SMYD3 expression (Extended Data Figs. 1d and 2c).
Intratracheal injection of an adenovirus expressing the Cre recombinase (Ad-Cre) in adult
Kras+/LSL-G12D mice led to the development of atypical adenomatous hyperplasia (AAH)
and adenomas in the lungs within 12 weeks7, irrespective of Smyd3 status (Fig. 2a-b;
Extended Data Fig. 3d). In contrast, at 16 and 20 weeks or more after Ad-Cre infection,
mice lacking Smyd3 showed significantly smaller and less advanced tumors than control
mice (Fig. 2a, c-d; Extended Data Fig. 3d; data not shown). Specifically, quantification of
tumor grade indicated that Smyd3 loss impeded the critical transition from adenoma to
adenocarcinoma (Fig. 2c), which was also observable at the whole organ level (Fig. 2d).
Moreover, the lifespan of KrasG12D-expressing mice was 20% longer if mutant for Smyd3
(Fig. 2e). Progression of lung cancer to carcinoma correlates with amplification of
Ras/MEK/ERK signaling14,15. Smyd3 deletion resulted in lower detection of pERK1/2
relative to control tumors without an overall change in total levels of Ras (Fig. 2f; Extended
Data Figs. 2a and 3f). Together, these observations indicate that SMYD3 promotes Rasdriven cancer development and progression in vivo.
Depletion of SMYD3 by RNA-mediated interference (RNAi) using a short hairpin (shRNA)
strategy in LKR10 mouse cells, a LAC-derived cell line16, A549, a human LAC cell line,
and CFPac1, a human PDAC cell line, reduced the proliferation rates for all three cell types
and inhibited their ability to grow in anchorage independent condition (Extended Data Fig.
4a-c). Furthermore, knockdown of SMYD3 in CFPac1 cells inhibited tumor growth in
mouse xenograft experiments (Extended Data Fig. 4d-f). Thus, SMYD3 acts to maintain a
number of tumorigenic characteristics in mouse and human cancer cell lines driven by
oncogenic Ras.

Next, wild-type SMYD3, a catalytically inactive form (SMYD3F183A)6, or vector control
were co-expressed with the Cre recombinase in the lungs of Kras;Smyd3 mutant mice by
lentiviral transduction (Extended Data Fig. 5a). Complementation of wild-type SMYD3 into
the lungs of Kras;Smyd3 mutant mice resulted in a higher tumor burden and pERK1/2 signal
relative to the control Cre-alone infection and expression of mutant SMYD3F183A (Fig. 3ac). Reconstitution experiments also demonstrated that SMYD3 catalytic activity is required
for pancreatic ADM (Extended Data Fig. 5b-c). We previously reported that SMYD3
methylates histone H4 at lysine 5 (H4K5) and not at other lysines on histones6. However, in
LAC and PDAC cells and tumors, virtually all SMYD3 is present in the cytoplasm (Fig. 1a
and Extended Data Figs. 2a, 2c, 3e, 6b), suggesting that the cancer-relevant substrate in
these cell types is unlikely to be nuclear H4K5 but rather a cytoplasmic protein.

In a biochemical screen for SMYD3 targets on a protein array platform containing greater
than 9000 potential substrates17, the only candidate to be methylated by SMYD3 in three
independent experiments was the MAP Kinase pathway component MAP3K2 (Extended
Data Fig. 6a). As shown in Figure 3d, recombinant wild-type SMYD3, but not the
catalytically dead SMYD3F183A mutant, methylated recombinant MAP3K2 in vitro. Using a
mutagenesis approach, we identified lysine 260 of MAP3K2 as the single site of methylation
catalyzed by SMYD3 (Fig. 3e; data not shown). The immediate sequence surrounding K260
of MAP3K2 and K5 of H4 is identical (GKGG), though the catalytic efficiency (kcat/KM) of

SMYD3 for MAP3K2 is nearly two orders of magnitude greater than it is for H4 (Extended
Data Fig. 6c). We also did not detect any methylation of H3 at lysine 4 by SMYD3, a
previously reported activity4 (Extended Data Fig. 6d-e). In addition, SMYD3 was the only
KMT of the eleven we tested that could methylate MAP3K2 (Fig. 3f-g; Extended Data Fig.
6f). Furthermore, while SMYD3 methylated MAP3K2, it had no detectable activity on a
dozen other members of the MAP Kinase signaling cascade (Fig. 3h). Finally, in vitro
methylation assays on MAP3K2 peptides spanning K260 (aa 249 to 273) with K260 either
unmethylated, mono-, di-, or tri-methylated showed that SMYD3 can utilize all lower states
of methylation as substrates to generate the fully saturated trimethyl state at K260 (Extended
Data Fig. 6g-h). Thus, SMYD3 mono-, di-, and tri-methylates MAP3K2 at lysine 260
(MAP3K2-K260me) with high specificity in vitro.

Author Manuscript

To investigate MAP3K2 methylation in cells, we raised methyl-specific antibodies against
the different states of methylation at K260 (Extended Data Fig. 6i). In co-transfection
experiments in human 293T cells, overexpressed MAP3K2 was methylated at K260 upon
SMYD3 overexpression (Extended Data Fig. 6j). Endogenous methylation at MAP3K2K260 was observed in LKR10 cells and RNAi-mediated depletion of SMYD3 in these cells
resulted in loss of this signal (Fig. 3i). Finally, the MAP3K2-K260me2/3 signal was
significantly reduced in tumor tissue micro-dissected from Kras versus Kras;Smyd3 mutant
mice (Fig. 3j). Thus, SMYD3 is required for maintenance of physiological levels of
MAP3K2-K260 methylation in cancer tissue and cells.

The cytoplasmic kinase MAP3K2 is activated in response to a variety of stress and
mitogenic stimuli, including EGF, and relays signals to downstream MAP Kinase
components such as ERK1/218 and ERK519. Given that the pERK1/2 and pERK5 signals
are reduced in LAC and PDAC samples from Smyd3 mutant mice (Figs. 1 and 2; Extended
Data Fig. 3), we reasoned that SMYD3-mediated methylation of MAP3K2 may regulate
signaling within the Ras/ERK pathway. We therefore examined the relationship between
SMYD3 and EGF-stimulated ERK1/2 activation. First, endogenous SMYD3 was depleted in
LKR10 by shRNA targeting the 3′ untranslated region of Smyd3 and then we reconstituted
the depleted cells with RNAi-resistant wild-type SMYD3 or catalytically inactive
SMYD3F183A. In control cells, EGF treatment triggered ERK1/2 phosphorylation, and this
response was greatly reduced by SMYD3 depletion (Fig. 4a). Complementation with wildtype SMYD3 re-established the EGF-mediated ERK1/2 phosphorylation response, whereas
complementation with SMYD3F183A failed to do so (Fig. 4a). SMYD3 was also required
when serum was used to activate ERK1/2 activation in LKR10 cells (Extended Data Fig. 7b)
and when EGF was used to activate ERK1/2 in human lung and pancreatic cancer cells
(Extended Data Fig. 7c-d). Finally, we established a MAP3K2 complementation system to
investigate the role of K260 of MAP3K2. In these experiments, wild-type MAP3K2 but not
the SMYD3-resistant MAP3K2K260A mutant, reconstituted the EGF-mediated ERK1/2
phosphorylation response (Fig. 4b).
To characterize how the SMYD3-MAP3K2 axis impinges on the overall MAP Kinase
network, the level of EGF-induced activation for several kinases was determined in control,
SMYD3 knockdown, and MAP3K2 knockdown LKR10, A549, and CFPac1 cells (Fig. 4c;
Extended Data Fig. 7a-d). SMYD3 and MAP3K2 were both required for full activation of

ERK5, ERK1/2, MEK1/2 and JNK (known downstream targets of MAP3K218-22), but
dispensable for activation of AKT and CRaf (RAF-1) (p38 was not activated in the tested
cell lines (Extended Data Fig. 7a-d)). Notably, MEK1/2 activation was impaired in SMYD3
and MAP3K2 knockdown cell lines. As the canonical ERK1/2 activation pathway consists
of Raf-MEK1/2-ERK1/2 and both SMYD3 and MAP3K2 were required for MEK1/2 and
ERK1/2 activation but not CRaf, we postulated that SMYD3 methylation of MAP3K2
directly influences MEK1/2 phosphorylation. Indeed, pMEK1/2 signal increased in response
to overexpression of wild-type MAP3K2 and a SMYD3-resistant MAP3K2K260A mutant,
but not a catalytically dead MAP3K2K385M mutant23 (Fig. 4d-e; Extended Data Fig. 7e).
SMYD3 expression alone had no effect on MEK1/2 activation (Extended Data Fig. 7e), but
resulted in increased MEK1/2 phosphorylation when co-expressed with wild-type MAP3K2
relative to co-expression with MAP3K2K260A (Fig. 4d-e). Notably, MAP3K2
phosphorylates MEK1 in in vitro kinase assays21, and this activity was unchanged if
SMYD3-methylated MAP3K2 or MAP3K2K260A were used in the kinase assays rather than
wild-type, unmethylated MAP3K2 (Extended Data Fig. 7f). These results suggest that the
molecular mode of action linking MAP3K2 methylation to MEK1/2 activation is not due to
changes in the intrinsic kinase activity of MAP3K2 but rather another mechanism.

Author Manuscript

Given the role of SMYD3-MAP3K2 in activating MEK1/2, we tested whether SMYD3
depletion augments the effects of the MEK1/2 inhibitor Trametinib, which is currently being
investigated to treat NSCLC and PDAC (http://clinicaltrials.gov/). Administration of Kras
and Kras;Smyd3 mutant mice with a normal dose of Trametinib blocked tumorigenesis in
both strains, though phosphorylation of ERK1/2 was still lower in mice depleted of SMYD3
(Extended Data Fig. 8). Notably, a low dose Trametinib regimen, which only partially
inhibited pERK1/2 levels and the formation of neoplastic lesions in Kras mutant mice, was
sufficient to block tumorigenesis and ERK1/2 activation in Smyd3 knockouts (Extended
Data Figure 8). Trametinib was also more potent in cancer cell lines when coupled with
SMYD3 depletion (Extended Data Fig. 9a). These data suggest that SMYD3 may act in
concert with MEK1/2 signaling in tumorigenesis. Indeed, overexpression of activated
MEK1S218D,S222D (MEK-DD) 24 rescued the effects of SMYD3 depletion in lung cancer
cells (Extended Data Fig. 9b)

Since the intrinsic kinase activity of MAP3K2 is not directly altered by methylation we
postulated that this modification event was involved in modulating a key protein-protein
interaction. To identify candidate methyl-sensitive binding partners of MAP3K2, a SILAC
(Stable Isotope Labelling by Amino acids in Cell culture)-based quantitative proteomic
screen was performed with cytoplasmic extracts to isolate proteins that bound differentially
to MAP3K2-K260me0 peptides versus MAP3K2-K260me3 peptides. While this analysis
did not show enrichment of any K260me3-binding proteins, it did reveal six candidates that
bind to the unmethylated peptide but are blocked by K260 trimethylation. Of these six
proteins, three are members of the PP2A serine/threonine phosphatase complex (Fig. 4f). In
our proteomics experiment we identified the catalytic PPP2CA protein, the structural
PPP2R1A protein and the regulatory PPP2R2A protein, three classes of subunits that
comprise the typical heterotrimeric PP2A complex. This complex is a major cellular
phosphatase that inactivates key members of the MAP Kinase signaling cascade (reviewed

in 25,26). We found that the interaction between the PP2A complex and MAP3K2 is direct,
as recombinant PPP2R2A, but not PPP2R1A, bound to MAP3K2-K260me0 peptides and
not to MAP3K2-K260me3 peptides in in vitro peptide pull-down experiments (Fig. 4g; top
panel). Moreover, PPP2R2A was specifically recovered from cytoplasmic extracts using
MAP3K2-K260me0 peptides but not by MAP3K2-K260me3 peptides (Fig. 4g; middle
panel). Thus, amino acids 249-273 of MAP3K2 are sufficient for binding directly to the
PP2A complex, via PPP2R2A, and methylation at K260 inhibits this interaction.

Author Manuscript

We next tested the ability of the PP2A inhibitor cantharidin27 to “phenocopy” SMYD3
function (Fig. 4h; Extended Data Fig. 10 a-d). Cantharidin treatment had no gross effect on
tumor formation in p48+/Cre Kras mutant mice relative to vehicle treatment; in contrast,
administration of cantharidin to p48+/Cre Kras;Smyd3 mutant mice restored tumor formation
to the level seen with wild-type SMYD3 in the p48+/Cre Kras mutant mice. These data
suggest an in vivo functional connection between the Ras pathway, SMYD3, and PP2A.

Author Manuscript

We have identified SMYD3-catalyzed methylation of MAP3K2 as a key event regulating
Ras signaling in cancer cells. While MAP3K2 directly phosphorylates MEK1/2, a complete
understanding of how MAP3K2 functions in Ras signaling remains to be determined. Our
data suggest a model in which increased SMYD3 activity generates a population of
methylated MAP3K2, which – via mechanisms such as blocking the association of the PP2A
phosphatase with components of the MAP kinase network – intensifies the output of this
pathway in response to oncogenic Ras (Extended Data Fig. 10e). In addition, the
cytoplasmic localization of the SMYD3-MAP3K2 dynamic suggests a paradigm for how
signaling through lysine methylation and phosphorylation can be integrated to regulate key
signal transduction cascades. A clinical implication of this work is the identification of
SMYD3 as a candidate therapeutic target for pharmacologic intervention to treat pancreatic
and lung cancers, as well as potentially other Ras-driven tumors. The complete loss of
SMYD3 function has no visible phenotype in mice, suggesting that SMYD3 inhibitors
would have minimal collateral toxicity as chemotherapeutics. Thus, one could envision a
therapeutic strategy comprising inhibitors of Raf or MEK that are currently used in the clinic
with a SMYD3 inhibitory agent, which could mitigate potential drug toxicity by lowering
the overall dose needed for each medicine and combat the development of resistance.
Together, our findings reveal a new function for lysine methylation signaling in the
cytoplasm in the regulation of cancer pathways.

Pancreatic epithelial explants from 4- to 6-week old p48Cre/+ (WT) and
p48Cre/+;Smyd3lox/lox (Smyd3) were established by modification of previously published
protocols35. In brief, the whole pancreas was harvested and treated twice with 1.2 mg/ml
collagenase-VIII (Sigma-Aldrich). Following multiple wash steps with McCoy's medium
containing soybean trypsin inhibitor (SBTI, 0.2 mg/ml), digested samples were filtered
through a 100 μm filter, resuspended in culture medium (Waymouth's MB 752/1
supplemented with 0.1% BSA, 0.2 mg/ml SBTI; 50 μg/ml bovine pituitary extract, 10 μg/ml
Insulin, 5 μg/ml transferrin, 6.7 ng/ml selenium in 30% FCS) and allowed to recover for 1h
at 37°C. Thereafter, cells were pelleted and resuspended in culture medium supplemented
with penicillin G (1000 U/ml), streptomycin (100 μg/ml), amphotericin B, 0.1% FCS, and an
equal volume of rat tail collagen type I (BD Bioscience). The cellular/rat tail collagen type I
suspension was immediately plated on plates pre-coated with 2.5 mg/ml of rat tail collagen
type I. In stimulation experiments recombinant human EGF (rhEGF, Invitrogen) was added
at final concentration of 25 ng/ml. For quantification, acinar explants were seeded in
triplicates. Cells clusters were counted from at least 3 optical fields/well and reported as a
percentage of acinar clusters and duct-like spheres. The quantification was performed in two
independent experiments; the number of mice is reported in the main text.
Lentiviral transduction of pancreatic epithelial explants—For reconstitution
experiments fresh explants from KrasLSL-G12D;Smyd3lacZ/lacZ (Smyd3 deficient) were
transduced using lentiviral vectors with or without Cre and expressing wild-type SMYD3 or

spontaneous ADM (acinar to ductal metaplasia), which was quantified as described above.

Meta-analysis of public PDAC and NSCLC data sets
We downloaded raw data for gene expression studies (7 pancreatic cancer, 6 NSCLC) from
the NCBI GEO and EBI ArrayExpress. After re-annotating the probes, each data set was
separately normalized using gcRMA. We applied two meta-analyses approaches to the
normalized data. The meta-analysis approach has been recently described37. Briefly, the first
approach combines effect sizes from each dataset into a meta-effect size to estimate the
amount of change in expression across all data sets. For each gene in each data set, an effect
size was computed using Hedges' adjusted g. If multiple probes mapped to a gene, the effect

size for each gene was summarized using the fixed effect inverse-variance model. We
combined study-specific effect sizes to obtain the pooled effect size and its standard error
using the random effects inverse-variance technique. We computed z-statistics as a ratio of
the pooled effect size to its standard error for each gene, and compared the result to a
standard normal distribution to obtain a nominal p-value. P-values were corrected for
multiple hypotheses testing using FDR38. We used a second non-parametric meta-analysis
that combines p-values from individual experiments to identify genes with a large effect size
in all data sets. Briefly, we calculated a t-statistic for each gene in each study. After
computing one-tail p-values for each gene, they were corrected for multiple hypotheses
using FDR. Next, we used Fisher's sum of logs method, which sums the logarithm of
corrected p-values across all data sets for each gene, and compares the sum against a chisquare distribution with 2k degrees of freedom, where k is the number of data sets used in
the analysis.

For total cell extracts, cells were lysed in RIPA buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl pH 8, 140 mM
NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 0.5 mM EGTA, 1% Triton, 0.1% SDS, 1mM PMSF, protease inhibitors
(Roche) and a phosphatase inhibitor cocktail (Sigma-Aldrich)) for 15mn. Cell fractionation
was performed by collecting supernatant (cytoplasmic fraction) after 5 min of 1300g
centrifugation following a 10 min incubation in hypotonic buffer (10mM Hepes pH7.9,
10mM KCL, 1.5mM MgCl2, 0.34M sucrose, 10% glycerol, 1 mM DTT, 0.05% Triton, and

20%, MgCl2 3 mM, Hepes pH7.9 50 mM, KCL 250 mM, DTT 0.5mM, PMSF 0.5 mM,
NP40 0,1%, protease inhibitors), and centrifuge at 15,000g for 10 min. The supernatant was
collected as soluble nuclear extract, and the pellet was further extracted in LSDB250 buffer
with sonication (chromatin fraction). Protein concentration was determined by the BCA
assay (Pierce).
For immunoprecipitation, cells were lysed in either LSDB250 buffer for smooth total cell
extract, or hypotonic buffer for cytoplasmic extract, and same amount of protein extracts
were incubated with specific antibody overnight at 4°C. Extracts were then incubated with
protein A sepharose beads (GE Healthcare) for 2 hours at 4°C.

μM 3H-SAM and 25 nM Smyd3 final. Reactions were quenched using 2 mM unlabeled
SAM. SPA signal was quantified in a Microbeta scintillation counter (PerkinElmer, USA).
Data were fit to the Michaelis-Menten equation 30, where the rate was plotted as a function
of the concentration of substrate.

To verify the activity of the other lysine methyltransferases tested, in vitro methylation
assays were performed using known substrates, as previously reported40-49.

Author Manuscript

In vitro kinase assays were performed by incubating 1 μg of recombinant MAP3K2 WT or
mutants with 1 μg of recombinant MEK1 in kinase buffer containing 25 mM Tris-HCl (pH
7.5), 5 mM b-glycerophosphate, 2 mM dithiothreitol (DTT), 0.1 mM Na3VO4, 10 mM

For peptide pull-downs, 5 to 10 μl of streptavidin sepharose beads (GE Healthcare) were
saturated with 10 μg of specific biotinylated peptides for 2 hours at 4°C under rotation in
peptide buffer (50 mM Tris pH7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 1% NP-40), then washed 3 times in same
buffer. Beads were then incubated with either 1 μg of recombinant proteins or 1 mg of HeLa
cytoplasmic extract for 4 hours at 4°C under rotation in peptide buffer. Beads were then
washed 3 times in same buffer and resuspended in Laemmli buffer for immunoblot analysis.

Author Manuscript

For SILAC peptide pulldown, HeLa cytoplasmic extracts were prepared from cells
cultivated in either normal amino acids culture condition (“light”) or using modified amino
acids culture condition (“heavy”). A 2-way experiments was performed, the “forward”
condition combining MAP3K2 K260me0 peptide with light extract and MAP3K2 K260me3
peptide with heavy extract, the “reverse” condition combining MAP3K2 K260me3 peptide
with light extract and MAP3K2 K260me0 peptide with heavy extract. Beads of each pair of
peptide pulldown were then pooled together, washed and extracts were resuspended in
Laemmli buffer and resolved by SDS-PAGE. In-gel trypsin digestion was performed and
peptides purified using C18 stage tips (Fisher) before Mass Spectrometry analysis to
quantify the ratio of each potential binders for K260me0 and K260me3 peptides, in forward
and reverse condition. To identify outliers in both the forward and the reverse experiment,
boxplot statistics was applied (cut off = 1.5× interquartile range). Proteins identified as
outlier in both experiments are assigned as significant interactors. Amino acid complements
used for SILAC are L-Lysine-2HCl (Thermo Scientific 88429), L-Arginine-HCl (Thermo
Scientific 88427), 2H4-L-Lysine-2HCl (Thermo Scientific 88438), 13C6-L-Arginine-HCl

Active Ras pull-down and detection

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

Ras activity refers to the level of guanosine triphosphate-bound Ras, which is able to bind
Ras binding domain (RBD) of RAF-1 as measured using a RBD-domain pull-down assay kit
as recommended by the manufacturer (The Active Ras Pull-Down and Detection Kit,
Thermo Scientific). Briefly, tumor biopsies were homogenized on ice in lysis buffer
containing 25 mM 4-(2–hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazineethanesulfonic acid (pH 7.5), 1% Igepal
CA-630, 150 mm NaCl, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate, 10% glycerol, 25 mm NaF, 10 mm
MgCl2, 1 mm ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin and 1
mm sodium orthovanadate. These samples were sonicated and centrifuged at 15 000g for 10
min at 4°C to remove cellular debris. Protein concentration was measured. Equal amounts of
lysate were incubated for 30 min at 4 °C with agarose beads coated with RBD. The beads
were then washed three times with ice-cold lysis buffer, boiled for 5 min at 95 °C, and active
Ras was analyzed by immunoblotting following standard protocol using Ras-specific
antibodies (Thermo Scientific). For comparison to total Ras protein, 2% of total lysates used
for pulldown was analyzed by immunoblot.
Cancer xenografts
For xenograft analysis, 500,000 CFPac1 cells were injected into the flank of NSG mice with
Matrigel (BD Bioscience). Tumor volume was measured at the times indicated and
calculated using the ellipsoid formula (length × width2).

methylation. Oncogenic Ras activates several kinase cascades that play important roles in
pancreas and lung cancer development, including four major MAPK pathways (ERK1/2,
ERK5, JNK, and p38) as well as AKT signaling. SMYD3 is frequently overexpressed in
pancreatic and lung cancers, two cancer types that are commonly driven by oncogenic Ras
signaling. Overexpression of SMYD3 and the resulting methylation of MAP3K2 at K260
potentiate activation of kinases like ERK1/2 and ERK5 in response to stimuli like oncogenic
Ras. We postulate a mechanism in which the PP2A complex is unable to bind methylated
MAP3K2, which decreases the ability of this enzyme to terminate activating

phosphorylation events on MAP3K2 and/or MAP3K2 downstream targets. Under conditions
with excessive SMYD3 protein, the physiologic relationship between PP2A and MAP3K2 is
disrupted and results in an increased pathologic MAP3K2 signaling, which cooperates with
Ras to promote tumorigenesis.
