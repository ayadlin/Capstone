ABSTRACT:
The polycomb group gene, EZH2, is highly expressed in advanced bladder cancer.
Here we demonstrated that down-regulation of EZH2 in tumor tissues after neoadjuvant chemotherapy correlated with good therapeutic response in advanced
bladder cancer. We next developed a small molecule, NSC745885, derived from
natural anthraquinone emodin, which down-regulated EZH2 via proteasome-mediated
degradation. NSC745885 showed potent selective toxicity against multiple cancer cell
lines but not normal cells. NSC745885 treatment overcame multiple-drug resistance
and inhibited growth of resistant cancer cells. Over-expression of EZH2 in cancer
cells attenuated effects of NSC745885, suggesting that down-regulation of EZH2 was
responsible for growth inhibition of NSC745885. NSC745885 also suppressed tumor
growth and down-regulated EZH2 in vivo. These results indicate that NSC7455889
suppresses bladder cancer by targeting EZH2.

INTRODUCTION

target(s) for cancer cells rather than normal cells.
Historically, most successful new drugs are from
either natural products or compounds derived from natural
products. Doxorubicin, mitomycin-C, and docetaxol are
from natural products and have revolutionized medicines
for clinical cancer treatment. However, natural product
research has been significantly reduced of late. A major
obstacle is the difficulty in discovering naturally-produced
drug candidates with potent, anti-cancer biological
activity. Currently, the favored method is high throughput
screen (HTS) of massive libraries of pure synthetic
compounds [4], but the output has been quite low, with
<0.001% hit rate (HR), compared to 0.3% HR for natural

Over the past decade, more than 350 new agents
have reported to be in clinical development for cancer
and cancer-related indications. Unfortunately, the pace of
approval for newly-developed agents has slowed down
since 2000 [1-3]. The approval process is often burdened
by many difficulties, which can be divided into two
categories: i) the safety profile and therapeutic efficacy of
the new agent to reflect its survival benefits, and ii) the
failure to identify essential drug target(s) responsible for
cancer biology [1]. For a new agent to be translated for
clinical trial, it must have selective toxicity with specific

products [5].
Another critical factor in new anti-cancer drug
development is the identification of crucial drug target(s)
responsible for cancer biology. The identification and
characterization of growth-factor and angiogenesis
signaling pathways that are crucial to the establishment,
progression, and metastases of tumors have brought a new
paradigm in cancer treatment: “targeted or personalized
therapy”. Anti-epidermoid growth factor receptor (EGFR),
imatinib, anti-HER2, heceptin, anti-angiogenesis, and
sunitinib are targeted therapies widely used in the
clinics. Yet despite encouraging clinical outcomes, they
rarely achieve comprehensive success. Thus, it is still
imperative to elucidate real fundamental factor(s) that
cause aggressive malignant behaviors as drug target(s).
The enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2) is a
member of the polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2).
With its major partners EED and SUZ12, it catalyzes the
di- and tri-methylation of histone H3 lysine 27 [6-9] but
unlike EED and SUZ12, it is essential for both embryonic
stem cell pluripotency and self-renewal [10-12].
Moreover, EZH2 expression is up-regulated in various
cancers [13-16] and has been found to serve as a marker
of the aggressive stages and clinical behavior of bladder
and prostate cancers [17, 18]. The ectopic over-expression
of EZH2 contributes to the malignant transformation
of normal prostatic cells [19, 20] and hyperplasia in
breast epithelium [21, 22], while its post-translational
modification alters oncogenic effects. Tumorigenicity
is increased when it is phosphorylated by Akt at Ser 27,
which attenuates its methyltransferase activity [23]. Wei
et al. have revealed that the phosphorylation of Thr 487
by CDK1 attenuates it methyltransferase activity resulting
in inhibition of cancer cell invasion [24, 25]. All these
oncogenic effects of EZH2 on cancer cells make it a
perfect target of new anti-cancer drug development.
Emodin (1,3,8-trihydroxy-6-methylan-thraquinone)
is an active constituent extracted of the rhizome of Rheum
palmatum. Literature suggests that emodin possesses
anti-bacterial [26], anti-inflammatory [27], immunosuppressive [28], and anti-cancer effects [29]. It also
down-regulates androgen receptors and suppresses
prostate cancer cell growth [30]. It has been previously
shown to modulate the EZH2-mediated H3 K27
trimethylation of bladder cancer cells [31]. The multiple
effects of naturally-produced emodin are intriguing such
that it has been used as a candidate for anti-cancer drug
development by synthesizing its derivatives.
In the present study, the cell-based platform with
GFP-EZH2 expression cancer cells is used to screen
multiple emodin derivatives that can target EZH2 for
new drug identification. The results show that an emodin
derivative, NSC745889, has potent anti-cancer effects by
down-regulating EZH2 through a proteasome-mediated
degradation pathway. Furthermore, NSC745889 has
selective cytotoxicity towards cancer cells but not normal

cells, can cause G2/M cell cycle arrest, and can overcome
multi-drug resistance to inhibit cancer cell growth in vitro
and suppress tumor growth in vivo. These results indicate
that NSC7455889 may be a potential anti-cancer medicine
by targeting oncogenic EZH2.

RESULTS
Down-regulation of EZH2 expression correlated
with treatment response to neo-adjuvant
chemotherapy
To analyze the EZH2 expression in bladder cancer
tissues from 12 patients who underwent neo-adjuvant
chemotherapy, immuno-histochemical analysis of
archived human paraffin-embedded bladder urothelial
carcinoma were selected (Supplemental Table 1). Staining
serial sections of tumor samples with EZH2 revealed
that EZH2 was highly expressed in 12 bladder cancer
tissues (Fig. 1A). However, the baseline EZH2 expression
levels in bladder cancer tissues did not correlate with the
therapeutic response to neo-adjuvant chemotherapy among
the 12 patients (Fig. B).
Eight pairs of fresh frozen cancer tissues were
obtained from patients before and after neo-adjuvant
chemotherapy. Four patients with good therapeutic
response had significantly down-regulated EZH2
expression in bladder cancer tissues after neo-adjuvant
chemotherapy. In contrast, unchanged or enhanced
EZH2 expression after neo-adjuvant chemotherapy
correlated with poor therapeutic response (Fig. 1C). Thus,
EZH2 might play a role in mediating drug resistance to
chemotherapy.

NSC745885 selectively inhibited cancer cell
growth and overcame drug resistance
A synthetic compound NSC745885 was generated
from emodin. NSC745885 shared a core structure with
anthraquinone category drugs like doxorubicin (Fig. 2A).
Using a cell-based platform with GFP-EZH2 expressing
293T cells, NSC745885 was identified as having potent
activity to specifically down-regulate EZH2 but not EZH1
(Fig. 2B and Supplemental Fig. 1). Its growth inhibition
effect was first tested to determine its IC50 on MBT-2, T24
bladder cancer cells, and SV-HUC-1 immortalized normal
urothelial cells by titrating different dosages in different
time periods (Supplemental Fig. 2).
The growth inhibition effect of NSC745885 was
compared to emodin and doxorubicin and MTT assay was
used to measure cell viability at indicated times. Results
demonstrated that 2.5 µM NSC745885 achieved the same
growth-inhibitory effect as 40 µM emodin and 2.5 µM

G2/M cell-cycle arrest of cancer cells

doxorubicin on two bladder cancer cell lines, MBT2 and
T24. However, NSC745885 was less toxic to normal 3T3
fibroblast and SV-HUC-1 immortalized normal urothelial
cells compared to emodin and doxorubicin (Figs. 2C and
2D).
The growth-inhibitory effect of NSC745885 was
further compared to doxorubicin on one pair of bladder
cancer cell line MGH-U1 and its derivative MGH-U1R
with multi-drug resistance. NSC745885 and doxorubicin
showed the same potency of growth inhibition on
MGH-U1 cells. As expected, MGH-U1R possessed up to
40-fold resistance to doxorubicin compared to its parental
MGH-U1 cells. Interestingly, the same dosage of 2.5 µM
NSC745885 treatment resulted in complete suppression
of MGH-U1R cell growth as observed in MGH-U1 cells
(Fig. 2E).

The EZH2 expression levels in the aforementioned
cell lines were further checked before and after
NSC745885 treatment. NSC745885 down-regulated
EZH2 in MBT2 and T24 bladder cancer cells with high
baseline EZH2 expression levels, but not in SV-HUC-1
immortalized normal urothelial cells (Fig. 3A). Moreover,
NSC745885 and doxorubicin both decreased EZH2
protein levels in drug-sensitive MGH-U1 bladder cancer
cells, but only NSC745885, not doxorubicin, downregulated EZH2 expression in multi-drug-resistant MGHU1R bladder cancer cells (Fig. 3B).
To further address the question why NSC745885
selectively down-regulated EZH2 in bladder cancer cells
than in normal urothelial cells, the phosphorylation status
at serine 21 and threonine 487 of EZH2 was examined
in MBT2, T24, and SV-HUC-1 cells. There were no
different basal levels of S21 and T487 phosphorylation

cells. (A) T24, MBT2, and SV-HUC-1 cells were treated with the indicated amount of NSC745885 for 24 h. (B) MGH-U1 and MGHUR

(labeled as DMSO) for 24 h. The cell cycle was analyzed by FACS analysis (mean±SEM, n=3). The percentage of cells in the defined stage

of EZH2 among MBT2, T24 and SV-HUC-1 cells. The
wild-type or mutant EZH2 (21A, 487A, mimicking
non-phosphorylation, and 21D, 487D, mimicking
phosphorylation) were transiently transfected into 293T
cells. NSC745885 treatment resulted in equal downregulation of wild-type and mutant EZH2 in 293T cells
(Supplemental Fig. 3).
The cell cycle profiles of these bladder cancer cell
lines and immortalized normal bladder urothelial cells
were further investigated subsequent to NSC745885
treatments, with DMSO-treated cells as controls.
NSC745885 treatment induced G2-M cell cycle arrest in
MBT2 and T24 bladder cancer cells, but not in SV-HUC-1
cells, in a dose-dependent manner for 24 h (Fig. 3C, upper
panel). NSC745885 treatment increased up to 15% and
20% of MBT2 and T24 cells, respectively, in the G2/M
phase (Fig. 3C, lower panel). NSC745885 treatment also
had no significant change in cell cycle distribution of SVHUC-1 immortalized normal urothelial cells, consistent

with less toxic results by MTT assays.
Furthermore, the main proteins responsible for
G2/M cell cycle transition, such as Aurora A, B, cdc2,
and Cdc25C, were down-regulated under NSC745885
treatment in MBT2 and T24 bladder cancer cells, but
not in SV-HUC-1 immortalized normal urothelial cells
(Supplemental Fig. 4)

NSC745885 down-regulated EZH2 and reexpressed its downstream-silenced tumor
suppressor genes
The effects of NSC745885 on EZH2 expression
levels in different cancer cell lines were further
investigated. NSC745885 treatment down-regulated the
EZH2 expression in eight cancer cell lines, including
prostate, breast, kidney, and bladder cancers. However,
the major components of polycomb repressive complex

Figure 4:NSC745885 treatment resulted in the down-regulation of EZH2 and up-regulation of EZH2-silencing tumor
suppressor genes in multiple cancer cell lines. (A) Multiple cancer cell lines (as indicated) were treated with 5 µM NSC745885
for 24 h. Whole cell lysates were harvested and prepared for Western blotting with the indicated antibodies. (B-D) T24, MBT2, PC3, and
SV-HUC-1 cells were treated with 2.5 and 5 μM NSC745885 or DMSO for 24 h. Relative mRNA expressions were verified by quantitative
real-time PCR. The expression levels of CDKN1C, DAB2IP and WNT5a were normalized to GADPH expression relative to DMSO control
and expressed as “relative expression” (mean±SEM, n=3).

2, SUZ12 and EED, were not significantly affected by
NSC745885 treatment (Fig. 4A). The global histone H3
K27 trimethylation, modified by EZH2, was also not
reduced by NSC745885 (Supplemental Fig. 5).
The EZH2 downstream targeted genes were
also investigated to determine if they were affected by
NSC745885 treatment. This resulted in the up-regulation
of EZH2-silenced tumor suppressor genes, including
CDKN1C, DAB2IP, and WNT5a, in a dose-dependent
manner in multiple cancer cell lines (e.g., T24, MBT2,
and PC3) (Figs. 4B-4D). Consistent with results that
NSC745885 did not inhibit the cell growth of SV-HUC-1
immortalized normal urothelial cells, NSC745885 had no
effects on EZH2 protein levels and its downstream target
gene expression in SV-HUC-1 cells (Fig. 4E).

dependent manner without any cytotoxic effect (Figs. 5A
and 5B). This doxycycline-induced EZH2 over-expression
attenuated the NSC745885-induced growth inhibition of
MBT2 cells (Fig. 5C).
Whether EZH2 over-expression had any effect
on NSC745885 cytotoxicity of other cancer cells was
further investigated. The PC3 prostate cancer cells
were transiently transfected with either vector or EZH2
plasmids, and then followed by NSC745885 treatment.
The cytotoxicity of NSC745885 was also significantly
attenuated in PC3 cells over-expressing EZH2 (Fig. 5D).

NSC745885 down-regulated EZH2 that was
responsible for its growth inhibitory effects on
cancer cells

To investigate the molecular mechanisms involved
in NSC745885-mediated EZH2 protein depletion, the
dynamic effects of NSC745885 on EZH2 expression
were first checked in T24 and MBT2 cancer cell lines.
NSC745885 efficiently depleted EZH2 expression in
a dose- and time-dependent manner (Figs. 6A and 6B).
Whether NSC745885 had an effect on EZH2 mRNA
expression was then investigated using real-time PCR.
NSC745885 did not reduce EZH2 mRNA compared to
control levels (Fig. 6C).

NSC745885 induced the degradation of EZH2 via
proteasome-mediated pathway

To investigate if EZH2 down-regulation was
responsible for the growth-inhibitory effects of
NSC745885 on cancer cells, TET-On, an inducible system,
was used to over-express EZH2 by doxycycline in MBT2
cells. EZH2 was induced by doxycycline in a dose-

were measured by MTT assay (mean±SEM, n=3 for each group).

From these, the effect of NSC745885 on EZH2
protein stability was further examined. Treatment with
the proteasome inhibitor MG132 resulted in marked
suppression of NSC745885-induced EZH2 protein
depletion in both T24 and MBT2 cells (Fig. 6D). EZH2
from cells treated with NSC745885 in the presence of
MG-132 were further immuno-precipitated. Immunoblotting revealed that NSC745885 treatment increased
the ubiquitination of EZH2 (Fig. 6E). Taken together,
these results indicated that the NSC745885-mediated
down-regulation of EZH2 proteins was mainly through a
proteasome-mediated ubiquitination protein degradation
pathway.

bearing MBT2 tumors treated with three intra-peritoneal
injections of either DMSO or 20 and 40 mg/Kg of
NSC745885 were also investigated. By Western blot, fresh
tumors harvested from the aforementioned experiment
showed that NSC745885 efficiently down-regulated EZH2
expression in vivo (Fig. 7C). The body weight and daily
activity of mice treated with NSC745885 did not show any
significant changes compared to mice in the control group
(data not shown).
Aside from using immuno-deficient mice
xenografted with MBT2 tumors, the in vivo anti-tumor
activity and safety of NSC745885 was further examined
by orthotopically injecting PC3 prostate cancer cells with
stable luciferase expression (PC3-Luc cells) into mice
prostate. The in vivo luciferase activity of injected PC3Luc cells was sequentially examined daily under the IVIS
Xenogene system. Treatment with the same protocol as the
xenografted experiments was started within two weeks of
the injection. The photon activity and volume of tumors
from mice treated with NSC745885 were significantly
decreased compared to those of the control group (Figs.
7D-7F). Thus, NSC745885 had potent anti-tumor effects
and down-regulated EZH2 in vivo.

NSC745885 suppressed tumor growth and downregulated EZH2 in xenograft animal models
To further investigate the in vivo anti-tumor activity
of NSC745885, MBT2 xenografts were used as an animal
model. NSC745885 showed significant anti-tumor activity
in mice bearing the MBT2 xenografts at relatively low
doses of 20 and 40 mg/Kg (Figs. 7A and 7B). The in vivo
effects of NSC745885 in down-regulating EZH2 in mice

control and EZH2 protein levels were measured by Western blotting. (E) MBT2 cells were transiently transfected with Ha-tagged ubiquitin

DISCUSSION

cells need to be further investigated. Moreover, EZH2
over-expression of cancer cells attenuates the NSC745885mediated growth inhibition, indicating that EZH2 is a
major target responsible for NSC745885 pharmacologic
anti-cancer activity.
Growing evidence demonstrates that histone
methyltransferase EZH2 has major roles in carcinogenesis.
The over-expression of EZH2 has been described in

The present study shows that the natural product
derivative NSC745885 efficiently depletes EZH2,
resulting in the inhibition of cell growth in various cancer
cells. Interestingly, NSC745885 has less effect on normal
cells, including fibroblast and epithelial cells. The reasons

various types of cancers, including prostate, breast,
bladder, gastric, lung, and hepatocellular carcinoma, which
correlate with aggressive clinical manifestations [32]. The
oncogenic effects of EZH2 have been experimentally
demonstrated by the induction of anchorage-independent
colony growth and the promotion of invasion in vitro by
the over-expression of EZH2 in breast epithelial cells
[21]. The exogenous expression of EZH2 also increases
the proliferation of mouse embryonic fibroblasts [33]. A
remarkable link between EZH2 binding and the aberrant
methylation of CpG islands at promoters had been shown
in different cancers [34-36]. The EZH2-mediated H3K27
trimethylation may act as a platform to recruit DNMTs
for aberrant CpG island hyper-methylation of promoters
to silence tumor suppressor genes in cancers [37].
Aside from the transcriptional repression of
tumor suppressor genes, EZH2 may contribute to tumor
development by misleading of cells towards a stem
cell-like status. EZH2 is essential for early mammalian
embryonic development [38]. Knock-out EZH2 in
embryonic stem cells results in a severe defect in
mesendodermal lineage commitment [39]. Supportive
evidence shows that human prostate cancer cells have a
gene expression signature similar to expression patterns
active in embryonic stem cells [40]. A cell line study
demonstrates increased EZH2 expression in CD44+/
CD24- metastatic PC3-32 cells compared to cells isolated
from the parent PC3 line [41].
It is interesting to know if EZH2 has a role in the
“cancer stem cell” driving force behind tumor proliferation
and progression [41]. Previous observations indicate
that EZH2 is a perfect candidate for developing the next
novel anti-cancer medicine. Since EZH2 is a histone
methyltransferase, inhibition of its enzyme activity has
been initially considered to be an effective way for cancer
treatment. However, several kinases have been found to
phosphorylate EZH2 at different sites that alter EZH2
enzyme activity. Akt and CDK1 phosphorylate EZH2
on S21 and T350, respectively, which lead to decreased
methyltransferase activity but enhanced oncogenic effects
[23, 24]. Post-translational modification of EZH2 also
hinders its methyltransferase activity and contributes to
the oncogenic processes. These clearly demonstrate that
targeting the EZH2 protein itself instead of its enzyme
activity will be a more efficient strategy for developing
anti-cancer medicine.
The exact molecular mechanisms of how EZH2
promotes cell proliferation remain unknown. EZH2 can
activate E2F-regulated genes [33], interfere with retinoic
acid receptor signaling [42], and repress anti-proliferative
genes [43] to facilitate cell proliferation. Depletion of
EZH2 by siRNA leads to cell cycle arrest of various
cancer cells at either G1 or G2 transition [18, 33, 44, 45].
A recent study has demonstrated that EZH2 represses
the cell cycle regulator p27 expression in pancreatic
cancer cells, resulting in G1/S arrest [43]. Another study
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

in colon cancer cells shows that EZH2 depletion results
in G1/S arrest without p27 re-expression. The findings
here reveal that EZH2 depletion by NSC745885 causes
G2/M cell cycle arrest in multiple cancer cell lines. Such
discrepancies suggest that the spectrum of EZH2 target
gene responses for cell proliferation and survival may vary
in a tissue- or cell-specific manner.
Another interesting finding here is that NSC745885
overcomes multiple drug resistances with efficient
EZH2 depletion of MGHU1R cancer cells. Multi-drug
resistance is one of the major obstacles in cancer treatment
with chemotherapeutic agents. Cancer stem cells are
suggested to be a possible reason mediating multi-drug
resistance by various mechanisms. The over-expression
of EZH2 contributes to acquired chemoresistance in
ovarian and pancreatic cancer cells [43, 46]. Furthermore,
chemotherapy enhances the cancer stem cell-like
population in ovarian cancer patients and cancer cell lines
with high EZH2 expression. EZH2 knock-down leads to
decreased ovarian cancer stem cell population and a reacquisition of chemo-sensitivity [47].
The data in this study also demonstrate that the
down-regulation of EZH2 expression also correlates with
the therapeutic response to neo-adjuvant chemotherapy of
patients with advanced bladder cancer. Thus, it is pivotal
to further investigate the underlying mechanisms of how
EZH2 participates in maintaining cancer stem cells and
mediates multi-drug resistance. The present study provides
evidence that NSC745885 efficiently depletes EZH2 in
cancer cells, which has the advantage of overcoming the
EZH2-mediated drug resistance of cancer stem cells.
The pharmacologic inhibition of EZH2 has been
shown by several agents, including 3-Deazaneplanocin A
(DZNep), sulforaphane, and GSK126 to show anti-cancer
activities in vitro and in vivo. DZNep and sulforaphane
down-regulates EZH2 through a proteasome-mediated
degradation pathway [48, 49]. GSK126, a sulfonylmethionine competitor, inhibits EZH2 enzyme activity
[50]. Although these three compounds have different
mechanisms of inhibiting EZH2, they all reduce the global
histone H3 K27 trimethylation, which is important for
maintaining the normal function of hematopoietic cells.
This raises concerns that such inhibitors may exhibit
important hematologic side effects [51-53].
In addition, the reduction of global H3 K27
trimethylation is associated with poor prognosis in several
cancer entities [54]. Interestingly, although NSC745885
treatment results in increased ubiquitination of EZH2
that is subsequently degraded by a proteasome pathway,
the global H3 K27 trimethylation is not concomitantly
reduced. This phenomenon also demonstrates that
NSC745885 has very low toxicity to normal cells, which
is advantageous for use in the clinical setting to avoid
treatment-related side effects. The ubiquitination system
is a potential anti-cancer target due to different activities
between normal and cancer cells. Further investigation of

the detailed mechanisms of how NSC745885 differentially
activates the ubiquitination system to regulate EZH2
protein stability in cancer cells is warranted.
In conclusion, this study provides in vitro and in vivo
evidence that a natural product derivative, NSC745885,
possesses potent anti-cancer effects. The oncogenic EZH2
is also identified as the therapeutic target of NSC745885,
which has a highly selective toxicity towards cancer cells
but not normal cells. The findings here also provide an
ideal pre-clinical model for cancer therapeutics that
warrants further investigation for clinical translation.

PC3-Luc (F-12), human bladder cancer cell T24 (RPMI),
human urothelial cell line SV-HUC-1 (F-12), murine
fibroblast NIH-3T3 (DMEM), and murine bladder cancer
cell MBT2 (RPMI). Human bladder cancer MGH-U1
and its multi-drug resistant derivative, MGH-U1R, were
provided by Dr. Cheng-Keng Chuang (Department of
Urology, Chang Gung Memorial Hospital) [55].
All culture conditions and techniques adhered to
the Bioresource Collection and Research Center (BCRC)
guidelines. The culture media used, including MEM,
DMEM, RPMI, and F-12, were indicated following the
cell lines used. All media were prepared based on the
manufacturer’s recommendations and were supplemented
with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, Biological Industries
Israel Beit-Haemek Ltd., Israel), 2 mM glutamine, 1 mM
sodium pyruvate, 50 U/ml of penicillin, and 50 µg/ml
streptomycin. All media and supplements were purchased
from Invitrogen (Grand Island, NY, USA).

Compound Inhibitor and Reagents
NSC745885 was synthesized and provided by Dr.
Hsu-Shan Huang (Department of Pharmacy, National
Defense Medical Center, ROC). The proteasome inhibitor
MG132 was purchased from Calbiochem (San Diego,
CA), while emodin, doxorubicin, and doxycyclined were
from Sigma-Aldrich (St Louis, MO, USA). All of the
drugs were dissolved in dimethylsulphoxide (DMSO)
(Merck, Darmstadt, Germany).

Plasmids and Primers
The V5-tagged EZH2 were constructed in
pCDNA56-TRm-V5-EZH2, carrying both tet-on operator
and tet-on repressor genes. pCDNA3.1-HA-ubiquitin was
obtained from Addgene (Cambridge, MA, USA). The
primers sequences used were shown in Supplementary
Table2.

Human Tissues
Human urothelial bladder tumors and matching
adjacent tissues were obtained from trans-urethral
resection specimens of patients before and after neoadjuvant chemotherapy under a protocol approved by
the Institutional Review Board of Tri-Service General
Hospital (TSGHIRB-2-101-05-001). All of the patients
provided informed consent. All of the tumor tissues
used were identified as clinical high-grade and advanced
urothelial cell carcinomas by the hospital’s Anatomic
Pathologist Board.

Stable Transfection of the MBT2 Cell Line
The MBT2 cell was transfected with pCDNA56TRm-V5-EZH2 or pCDNA56-TRm-null by lipofectamin
2000 (Invitrogen, Grand Island, NY, USA). The cells were
challenged with blasticidin (Invitrogen, Grand Island, NY,
USA) 24 h post-transfection and this was maintained for
about two weeks until single colonies clearly formed.
Single colonies were picked-up, expanded, and maintained
in standard DMEM medium containing blasticidin.

bromide assay (Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO, USA).
Cells were seeded in a 96-well plate (Corning, NY, USA)
in a density of 3,000 cells per well one day prior to the
experiment. NSC745885 was mixed with culture medium
in the indicated concentrations. NSC745885 treatment
was performed by replacing the exhausted medium with
NSC745885-containing fresh medium. The treated cells
were harvested at the scheduled time points (24-, 48-, and
72-h), and incubated with 1µg/ml MTT at 37ºC for 3 h.
After removing the supernatant, the deposited crystals
were dissolved in 100 μl of DMSO and absorbance was
measured at 560 nm using a micro-plate reader.

Total mRNA was extracted with TRIZol Reagent
(Invitrogen, Grand Island, NY, USA) following the
manufacturer’s instructions. The harvested RNA was
quantified by a NanoDrop spectrophotomerter (Thermo
Fisher Scientific Inc., Wilmington, DE, USA). Total
mRNA was then converted to complementary DNA
(cDNA) using a SuperScriptIII first-strand cDNA synthesis
kit (Invitrogen, Grand Island, NY, USA). cDNA 2 µg were
subjected to polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or real-time
PCR (RT-PCR) with the primer listed in supplemental
materials.
Taq DNA polymerase and reagents were purchased
from Invitrogen (Grand Island, NY, USA) and real-time
PCR were performed using the ABI 7500 real-time PCR
system (Invitrogen-Life Technologies, ABI, Grand Island,
NY, USA). Data were quantified relative to the 2 delta Ct
method, based on the manufacturer’s instructions.

Cell Cycle Analysis
The cells were seeded in 6-well plates at 3×105
for 24 h and then treated with emodin or DMSO after
another 24 h. The cells were then fixed with 70% ice-cold
ethanol over one hour before the ethanol was removed.
Subsequently, the cells were stained with PI buffer (20 μg
/ml Propidium iodide, 0.1% Triton X-100, and 200 μg/
ml RNase A in PBS) at 37°C for 30 min. The cell-cycle
distribution was analyzed by counting the DNA content
using a FACS Calibur flow cytometer.

Immuno-precipitation
Cells treated with NSC745885 and/ or MG132 were
lysed in RIPA buffer and quantified with BCA methods
(Bi-cinchoninic acid, Thermo-Pierce, Rockford, IL, USA).
Total protein 1 mg was prepared by incubation with
protein G-sepharose (GE Amersham, UK) and subsequent
incubation with specific antibodies at 4ºC for 4 h. Protein
G-sepharose were added for another 12-16 h and incubated
at 4ºC. After antibody and protein G-sepharose incubation,
the precipitated sepharose were washed five times with
RIPA buffer, and mixed and cooked with SDS loading
buffer (Thermo-Fermentas, Rockfor, IL, USA) for SDSPAGE analysis.

Western Blot Analysis
Human tissues for Western blotting were lysed in
RIPA (50 mM Tris pH 7.4, 1% NP40, 150 mM NaCl,
40 mM NaF, 1 mM Na3VO4, 1 mM EDTA and 10 µl/ml
of protease inhibitor cocktail) buffer. For cell lines, the
cells were seeded in dishes at 60% confluence overnight
and then treated with emodin or vehicle control for 24 h.
The cells were lysed in ice-cold RIPA buffer according to
previously described methods [56]. Protein concentrations
were quantified using a BCA assay (Thermo Scientific
Pierce) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Lysate
5-40 µg was loaded into each lane by Western blotting.
The specific signal was detected using a secondary
antibody coupled with horseradish peroxidase (Jackson
ImmunoResearch Labs) and Chemilucent Plus Western
Blot Enhancing Kit (Millipore, Bedford, MA, USA).
The antibodies used included anti-EZH2 (Clone:
AC-22, CellSignaling, Danvers, MA, USA), anti-Actin
(Sigma, St Louis, MI, USA), anti-V5 tag (AbD Serotec,
USA), anti-H3K27me3 (Merck-Millipore, Upstate, Lake
Placid, NY, USA), anti-EED (Abcam, Cambridge, UK),
anti-Suz12 (CellSignaling, Danvers, MA, USA), antiHA (Clone:12CA5, Roche), and anti-GAPDH (Sigma,
St Louis, MI, USA). Secondary antibodies, including
goat-anti-mouse-HRP
and
goat-anti-rabbit-HRP,
were purchased from Jackson ImmunoResearch Labs
(Westgrove, CA, USA).

Immuno-fluorescent Microscopy
Cells were seeded in poly-L-lysine-coated cover
slips overnight and treated with 5 μM NSC745885 or
DMSO in equal volumes for 16 h, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in normal saline, and counterstained with
DAPI (Invitrogen, MolecularProbe, Grand Island, NY,
USA). The cover slips were mounted in anti-fade Golden
mounting reagent (Invitrogen, MolecularProbe, Grand
Island, NY, USA). Images were taken using the Leica
DM250 fluorescent microscopy system with an Andor
camera (Andor Technology plc. Belfast, UK) and analyzed
by the Metamorph software (Leica Microsystem, Wetzlar,
D-35578, Germany). Approximately 300 EGFP-EZH2
expressing cells were counted from 10 images of each
treatment. After measuring the average photon intensity,
cells with oversaturated signals were eliminated in the
count.
