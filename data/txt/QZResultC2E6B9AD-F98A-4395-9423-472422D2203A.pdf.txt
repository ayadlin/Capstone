ABSTRACT
Endoplasmic reticulum stress from unfolded proteins is associated with the
proliferation of pancreatic tumor cells, making the many regulatory molecules of
this pathway appealing targets for therapy. The objective of our study was to assess
potential therapeutic efficacy of inhibitors of unfolded protein response (UPR) in
pancreatic cancers focusing on IRE1α inhibitors. IRE1α-mediated XBP-1 mRNA splicing
encodes a transcription factor that enhances transcription of chaperone proteins in
order to reverse UPR. Proliferation assays using a panel of 14 pancreatic cancer cell
lines showed a dose- and time-dependent growth inhibition by IRE1α-specific inhibitors
(STF-083010, 2-Hydroxy-1-naphthaldehyde, 3-Ethoxy-5,6-dibromosalicylaldehyde,
toyocamycin). Growth inhibition was also noted using a clonogenic growth assay in
soft agar, as well as a xenograft in vivo model of pancreatic cancer. Cell cycle analysis
showed that these IRE1α inhibitors caused growth arrest at either the G1 or G2/M
phases (SU8686, MiaPaCa2) and induced apoptosis (Panc0327, Panc0403). Western
blot analysis showed cleavage of caspase 3 and PARP, and prominent induction of the
apoptotic molecule BIM. In addition, synergistic effects were found between either
STF-083010, 2-Hydroxy-1-naphthaldehyde, 3-Ethoxy-5,6-dibromosalicylaldehyde, or
toyocamycin and either gemcitabine or bortezomib. Our data suggest that use of an
IRE1α inhibitor is a novel therapeutic approach for treatment of pancreatic cancers.

INTRODUCTION

of gemcitabine-based combinations have been/are being
tested.[5, 6] However, to a large extent, chemotherapy
is ineffective and novel therapeutic options are direly
needed.[7]
Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is an organelle where
cellular processes occur such as lipid synthesis, calcium
storage, and appropriate processing of membrane and
secreted proteins for maturation. Stress such as hypoxia
or oxidative stress can cause accumulation of misfolded
proteins in ER lumen, which triggers unfolded protein
response (UPR) for either ER homeostasis or apoptosis.

Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma is one of the most
common causes of death from cancer in both males and
females.[1] More than 80% of patients are diagnosed at an
advanced stage; and the average 5-year survival rate is less
than 5%[1]. One important feature of pancreatic cancer
is the intense desmoplastic reaction around the tumors,
which may impede delivery of therapeutic agents.[2]
Gemcitabine and 5-fluorouracil are the standard treatment
for advanced pancreatic cancers [3, 4] and a large number

RESULTS

[8] Adapting to ER stress, cells activate a dynamic UPR
mechanism that has three major signaling pathways:
IRE1α/XBP-1, ATF6, and PERK (pancreatic endoplasmic
reticulum kinase). In response to ER stress, an initial
cytoprotective mechanism is to release the ER chaperone
GRP78 to facilitate protein folding. GRP78 is up-regulated
in many cancers and is associated with poor survival.[911] However, when cells are unable to protect against ER
stress, both intrinsic and extrinsic cell death pathways are
activated, and severely damaged cells are removed.[12,
13] Additionally, after these sensor molecules (IRE1α/
XBP-1, ATF6, and PERK) are released from GRP78,
cascades of UPR signaling are activated to balance
survival against damage caused by ER stress. Of note,
the tumor microenvironment for pancreatic cancers is
extremely rich in stroma and is hypoxic and deficient
in metabolites.[14] This predisposes these tumors to
ER stress and UPR activation. The dynamics of UPR in
these rapidly growing hypoxic tumors present potential
therapeutic option.[15-17]
Therapy based on targeting GRP78 and other UPR
signaling has been shown to inhibit growth of tumors.[18,
19] Drugs activating ER stress have been use for clinical
treatment of cancers. Bortezomib, a proteosome inhibitor,
induces ER stress and has therapeutic efficacy in multiple
myeloma.[20, 21] Bortezomib also induces ER stress in
pancreatic cancer cells and suppresses the UPR in these
cancer cells.[22] Bortezomib also synergizes with cisplatin
causing apoptosis of pancreatic cancer cells which may
be mediated through enhanced ER stress via increased
expression of CHOP/GADD153 and BiP/GRP78.[23]
Another approach to induce pancreatic cancer cell
death is to inhibit the repair of UPR. For example, an
IRE1α inhibitor STF-083010 (STF) and its hydrolyzed
product 2-Hydroxy-1-naphthaldehyde (HNA) block
XBP-1 splicing, down-regulate XBP-1s expression and
cause apoptosis in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL)
cells.[24] Furthermore, in multiple myeloma, inhibition
of IRE1α-XBP-1s pathway by toyocamycin synergized
with bortezomib to induce apoptosis.[25] In addition,
high throughput screening identified salicylaldimine
analogs as potent inhibitors of IRE1α endonuclease
activity.[26] One salicylaldimine analog, 3-Ethoxy-5,6dibromosalicylaldehyde (3ETH) inhibits XBP-1 splicing
in myeloma cells both in vitro and in a murine model of
ER stress in vivo.
As a result of these studies, we hypothesize that
pancreatic cancers are under ER stress; and if we inhibit
the protective mechanism of these cells against this stress
by IRE1α inhibitors, these pancreatic cancer cells will
undergo apoptosis suggesting a novel therapeutic approach
to this rapidly fatal disease.

Anti-proliferative activity of IRE1α inhibitors in
pancreatic cancer cell lines
We initially examined the ability of two IRE1α
inhibitors (STF and HNA) to inhibit the splicing of XBP-1
to XBP-1s in pancreatic cancer cell lines. Three pancreatic
cancer cell lines (MiaPaCa2, Panc0403, SU8686) were
pre-treated with tunicamycin to induce ER stress resulting
in IRE1α activation and splicing of XBP-1 to XBP-1s.
STF and HNA suppressed the levels of splicing in a dosedependent manner (Fig.1). Since the inhibitory activity of
STF in CLL was at the 50 µM range,[24] we expanded
our analysis to 6 pancreatic cancer cell lines (MiaPaCa2,
Panc1005, SU8686, AsPc1, Panc0403, Panc0327) using
50 µM of either STF or HNA. Other than Panc0327 cells,
HNA was as potent as STF (Fig. 2A). The studies were
then expanded and dose-responses of three different
IRE1α inhibitors (HNA, 3ETH, toyocamycin) were
tested against a panel of 11 pancreatic cancer cell lines
(Panc0203, Panc0327, Panc0403, SU8686, MiaPaCa2,
Panc1, Panc0813, AsPC1, BxPc3, Panc0203, Panc1005)
using an in vitro proliferation assay (MTT). Most of the
pancreatic cancer cell lines were sensitive to these 3
IRE1α inhibitors with a wide range of IC50s from 0.2 to
100 µM (Fig. 2B). Notably, three pancreatic cancer cell
lines (AsPc1, BxPc3, PL45) were resistant to HNA even
at 100 uM, but were sensitive to 3ETH and toyocamycin;
while Panc0813 was sensitive to HNA, but resistant to
toyocamycin (Fig. 2B). Together, these data suggested
that these inhibitors had different modes of activity or
metabolism within these cancer cells.
Colony formation on plastic and soft agar was
examined using two pancreatic cancer cell lines
(MiaPaCa2, Panc0403) after 14 days exposure to either
HNA, 3ETH, or toyocamycin. Toyocamycin decreased
clonal growth in a dose-dependent manner by both assays
(Figs. 3A & 3B). Also, pancreatic cancer cells treated
with HNA formed progressively fewer colonies on plastic
(Fig. 3C), but to a lesser extent when assayed in soft agar
(Fig. 3D). 3ETH was only examined in soft agar and also
inhibited pancreatic clonal growth (Fig. 3E).
The anti-tumor activity of 3ETH on pancreatic
cancer cell growth in vivo was examined using BxPc3
human tumors growing as xenografts in NOD/SCID
mice. After tumors began their growth at day 4, mice were
divided blindly into two groups and treated with either 20
mg/kg of 3ETH or vehicle (PBS) alone for 4 weeks. At
conclusion of the study, tumors were carefully dissected
and weighed. Mean weight of tumors was significantly
greater in the control mice than the cohort treated with
3ETH (Fig. 4, P= 0.0016). We also tested HNA in vivo by
growing Panc0403 human xenograft in NOD/SCID mice.

6).

The fact that pancreatic tumors are usually densely
embedded within stromal cells creating a hypoxic
environment, we examined if the IRE1α inhibitor
(toyocamycin) combined with bortezomib had the same
efficacy at normoxic (21% O2) versus hypoxic (2% O2)
conditions. Two cell lines (MiaPaCa2, AsPc1) were
treated with the combination of toyocamycin (25, 250,
or 2500 nM) and bortezomib (1.6, 16, or 166 nM) (Fig.
7A). CI plots showed that irrespective of the oxygen
environment, synergistic growth inhibition prevailed
against pancreatic cancer cells (Fig. 7B). The CI values
were below 1 at the combination of 25 nM toyocamycin
and 1.6 nM bortezomib (Fig. 7B, data point 1), or 250 nM
toyocamycin and 16 nM bortezomib (Fig. 7B, data point
2).

Synergistic effects of IRE1α inhibitors combined
with other therapeutic reagents, as well as the
effect of hypoxia
Because the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib
induces cell stress.[22] we investigated if the combination
of IRE1α inhibitors with bortezomib has the capacity
to act synergistically. Four pancreatic cancer cell lines
(Panc0403, Panc1005, BxPc3, MiaPaCa2) were treated
with different combination of bortezomib (10 or 50
nM) and STF (10 or 50 µM) (Fig. 5A). The normalized
isobologram analysis demonstrated synergistic activity
between 10 µM STF and either 10 or 50 nM bortezomib in
all four cell lines (Fig. 5B, data points 1 and 2). Moreover,
a higher concentration of STF (50 µM) attained synergy
after addition of bortezomib either at a concentration of 10
nM when tested against BxPc3 cells (Fig. 5B, data point
3), at a concentration of 50 nM against Panc1005 cells
(Fig. 5B, data point 4), and at either 10 or 50 nM against
Panc0403 cells (Fig. 5B, data points 3 and 4).
We further explored the combination of either HNA
or toyocamycin with either bortezomib, 17-DMAG (heat
shock protein inhibitor, 17-Dimethylaminoethylamino17-demethoxygeldanamycin), gemcitabine (frequently
used therapeutic agent), or dasatinib (src kinase inhibitor,
FDA-approved for treatment of pancreatic cancer) in
pancreatic cancer cells (Panc0403, SU8686, MiaPaCa2).
Combination index (CI) was calculated and the CI plots
showed synergistic activity of either HNA or toyocamycin
combined with these drugs at concentrations shown (Fig.

Mechanisms underlying the anti-proliferative
effects of IRE1α inhibitors against pancreatic
cancer cells:
Pancreatic cancer cells (Panc0403) cultured with
HNA (10 and 50 µM, 24 hr) had a substantial pre-G1
fraction after exposure to 10 µM HNA (25%, apoptotic
cells) and 50 µM HNA (36%, apoptotic cells) (Fig.
8A). Testing of two other pancreatic cancer cell lines
(MiaPaCa2, Panc0327) treated with HNA (10 µM, 24 hr)
also induced an increase of the pre-G1 fraction (23% and
28%, respectively, Fig 8B).
We wondered if these IRE1α inhibitors also effected
mitochondria. The assay, TMRE, detects mitochondrial
membrane depolarization. Panc0403 cells treated with
increasing concentrations of either HNA (0.1 - 10 µM) or
toyocamycin (1, 5 µM) showed decreasing mitochondrial

(toyocamycin [0.5, 1 µM], HNA [10 µM] or 3ETH [1, 10 µM]) for 14 days; and colony formation on plastic (A, C) and soft agar (B, D,

membrane potential by either flow cytometer (Fig. 9A) or
fluorescence microplate reader (Fig. 9B). Furthermore,
two other pancreatic cancer cell lines (Panc1, Panc0327)
treated with HNA (10, 50 µM) or toyocamycin (1, 5
µM) also displayed markedly decreased mitochondrial
membrane potential (Fig. 9B).
Expression levels of proteins related to cellular
apoptosis were examined in two pancreatic cancer cell
lines (Panc0403, MiaPaCa2) after treatment with either
HNA (10 µM) or toyocamcin (1 µM). Protein levels of
the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 decreased and the proapoptotic protein BIM increased (Fig. 10A). Both long
and short forms of BIM were induced in Panc0403 cells,
but only the long form was induced in MiaPaCa2 cells
(Fig. 10A). Total caspase 3 protein levels decreased and
cleaved PARP levels increased (Fig. 10A). Since BIM was
markedly induced after HNA treatment, pancreatic cancer
cells (MiaPaCa2, Panc0403) were infected with shRNA
targeting BIM to examine the role of BIM in mediating
the anti-proliferative activity of HNA. Two stable
clones were selected from both cell lines infected with
shBIM (shBIM1, shBIM2). Based on the real-time PCR,
expression levels of BIM mRNA were similarly silenced
in all stable pancreatic cancer cell lines containing shBIM
(Fig. 10B), These experimental clones and control clone

(one clone from scrambled shRNA - shCON) were treated
with HNA (1, 10 uM), and cell viability were determined
by MTT assays. Knockdown of BIM caused the pancreatic
cancer cells to become more resistant to killing by HNA
with Panc0403 with stable shBIM2 having the greatest
resistance to HNA (p = 0.038, Fig. 10B). This suggests
pancreatic cancer cell death by IRE1α inhibitors is
partially attributed to induction of BIM.
Since BIM can be transcriptionally activated by
CHOP in UPR,[27] we examined CHOP mRNA levels
after treatment with IRE1α inhibitors in four pancreatic
cancer cell lines (MiaPaCa2, Panc0403, SU8686, AsPc1).
As expected, pre-treatment with tunicamycin induced
CHOP expression which was further increased by the
addition of either STF or HNA (Fig. 11A).
DNAJB9 is one of the UPR target genes which
transcriptionally activated by XBP-1s.[28] In pancreatic
cancer cells treated with either STF or HNA, levels of
DNAJB9 mRNA were suppressed after initial induction

Figure 9: Mitochondrial membrane depolarization

were treated with HNA at 0.1, 1, 10 uM for 24 hr, and
mitochondrial membrane potential was analysed by TMRE
(tetramethyrhodamine ethyl ester percholarte) fluorescence.
Histograms show the amount of TMRE sequestered by
mitochondrial membrane. Low TMRE fluorescence (arrow)
indicates decreased membrane potential. From the histogram,
the portion of cells with low TMRE fluorescence (membrane
potential) is summarized in the bar graph. (B) Three pancreatic
cancer cell lines (Panc1, Panc0327, Panc0403) were treated with
either HNA or toyocamycin at different concentrations for 24 hr
and uptake of TMRE fluorescence by the cells was detected by
a fluorescent plate reader. Each sample was run in duplicate, and
the data represent the mean ± SD of two separate assays.

by tunicamycin (Fig. 11B). We also examined the
transcription factor ATF4 of the PERK branch of UPR,
and found that expression levels of ATF4 were not
affected in two cell lines (MiaPaCa2, Panc0403), but were
induced substantially in two other (SU8686, AsPc1) after
either STF or HNA treatment (Fig. 11C). This suggests
differential cellular response to these compounds.
We also examined levels of several other key
proteins associated with cellular ER stress and cell growth.
Phosphorylated Erk and its upstream regulator PDK1,
were down-regulated and phosphorylation of JNK was
increased after HNA treatment in two of the pancreatic
cancer cell lines (Fig. 12A). A reactive oxygen species
(ROS) sensor thioredoxin binding protein (TXNIP) and
thioredoxin (TXN) were evaluated in pancreatic cancer
cells (Panc0403, MiaPaCa2) following treatment with

either HNA or 3ETH. Messenger RNA expression levels
of TXNIP were up-regulated while TXN levels were
down-regulated by HNA and 3ETH (Fig. 12B).

DISCUSSION
The ER plays an important role in the secretory
pathway in which proteins undergo post-translational
modification. Overload of nascent proteins or mis- and
un-folded proteins induces ER stress and activates UPR.
Studies have found that a histone deacetylase inhibitor
such as panobinostat induces apoptosis in hepatocellular
carcinoma associated with up-regulation of ER stress
markers (Grp78, eIf2a, and XBP-1).[29] Treatment of
chronic lymphocytic leukemia and multiple myeloma

cells with brefeldin A, an inhibitor of ER to Golgi
protein transport cause a decrease in VEGF secretion and
abnormal ER swelling; and subsequently activation of
caspases, and cell death.[30] UPR is an intricate process
in the face of cellular ER stress. Initial UPR attempts to
restore ER homeostasis is by temporarily suspending
protein translation. In addition, ER stress stimulates IRE1α
to splice XBP-1 mRNA resulting XBP-1s.[31] XBP-1s
becomes an active transcription factor enhancing synthesis
of genes involved in protecting the cells from changing
levels of ER stress and unfolded poteins.
Pancreatic cancer remains a catastrophic disease
with a 5-year survival rate of 5%. First-line therapy with
either gemcitabine or gemcitabine-based chemotherapeutic
combinations provides small clinical improvements, but
new effective treatment options are clearly needed. We
examined the effect of four IRE1α inhibitors (STF, HNA,
3ETH, toyocamycin) against a panel of 11 pancreatic
cancer cell lines using a MTT liquid culture assay and
found a wide range of drug sensitivities, ranging from
2 to 100 µM. We then employed a much more sensitive
assay, clonogenic growth in soft agar which showed
that these pancreatic cancer cells were very sensitive to
growth inhibition by IRE1α inhibitors. Importantly, the
IRE1α inhibitor (3ETH) also decreased the proliferation
of human pancreatic cancer xenografts growing in vivo
(70% growth compared to control cells, p = 0.0116). The
data suggest IRE1α inhibitors significantly reduce growth
of pancreatic tumors.
In further experiments, synergism was found by
combining IRE1α inhibitors with FDA-approved agents
such as either bortezomib, 17-DMAG, gemcitabine, or
dasatinib. Our findings indicate that selective inhibition
of ER stress by IRE1α inhibitors could curb pancreatic
cancer cell growth in drug combination. Pancreatic cancers
are extremely rich in stromal cells and are hypovascular,
suggesting that the cancer cells are hypoxic. In view of
this landscape, we explored the drug combination of
bortezomib and toyocamycin in hypoxic conditions.
Synergism was sustained when tested in hypoxic condition
(2% O2).
Our mechanistic studies of how IRE1α inhibitors
decrease pancreatic cancer cell proliferation found these
agents robustly induced prominent levels of BIM. In
contrast, silencing of BIM rendered pancreatic cancer cells
less sensitive to killing by IRE1α inhibitors. Attenuation
of cell death by BIM knockdown was partial and in some
clones not statistically significant. This may be due to
incomplete silencing of BIM as well as involvement of
additional pathways important in cell death mediated by
IRE1α inhibitors. We found the extra-long form of BIM
(BIM-EL) was induced in two pancreatic cancer cell lines
(Panc0403 and MiaPaCa2). The pro-apoptotic BIM-EL
can be phosphorylated and subsequently degraded in the
proteasome when ERK signaling is activated.[32, 33] In
addition, phosphorylation of BIM by ERK reduces its
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

pro-apoptotic activity by preventing binding of BIM to
BAX.[34] On the other hand, phosphorylation of BIM
by JNK at a different site activates the apoptotic activity
of BIM and induces BAX-dependent apoptosis[35]. Our
treatment of pancreatic cancer cells with IRE1α inhibitors
decreased levels of phosphorylated ERK and increased
levels of phosphorylated JNK. These data suggest upon
treatment with IRE1α inhibitors, BIM was activated by
JNK phosphorylation as well as heterodimerization with
BAX to promote cell apoptosis of pancreatic cancer cells.
CHOP is another primary target of induction of
cell death after stress activation of ER.[27] It can be
activated transcriptionally through all three branches of
UPR: IRE1α, PERK/ATF4, and ATF6.[36] Treatment
of pancreatic cancer cells with IRE1α inhibitors still
caused induction of CHOP, suggesting CHOP was
activated through ATF4 and ATF6. Our real-time PCR
results suggest the ATF6 pathway was stimulated. Also,
a previous study showed that through DR5 activation, the
JNK pathway induced CHOP and the cell death pathway.
[37] As mentioned above, we showed that phosphorylation
of JNK was up-regulated after exposure of the pancreatic
cancer cells to an IRE1α inhibitor. This suggests that
pancreatic cancer cell death by IRE1α inhibitors may also
involve phosphorylation levels of JNK, which induces
CHOP.
Examination of mitochondrial membrane potential
revealed pancreatic cancer cell death caused by IRE1α
inhibitors may also involve the intrinsic mitochondriamediated apoptosis pathway. Mitochondrial membrane
potential was lost when pancreatic cancer cells were
treated with IRE1α inhibitors. Loss of mitochondrial
membrane potential can lead to swelling of mitochondrial
membrane and release of cytochrome C to cytosol, which
activates caspase 3 and apoptosis.[38] Congruent with
activation of this pathway, cleavage of caspase 3 and cell
death occurred after exposure of the pancreatic cancer
cells to IRE1α inhibitors.
ROS scavenger TXN and its interacting protein
TXNIP play an important role in regulating oxidative
stress[39] and over-expression of TXNIP will induce G0/
G1 cell cycle arrest.[40] Crosstalk between ER stress and
ROS has previously been suggested.[41, 42] Our data
showed that TXNIP was induced and TXN was reduced
after pancreatic cancer cells were treated with IRE1α
inhibitors. These results suggest that IRE1α inhibitors may
induce ROS helping to mediate cell death.
Based on our findings, we proposed a scheme
to elucidate the anti-proliferative activities of IRE1α
inhibitors (STF, HNA, 3ETH, toyocamycin) in pancreatic
cancer cells. IRE1α inhibitors caused overwhelming ER
stress, which induced CHOP expression and subsequently
BIM activation (Fig. 13, step 1). Perturbation of ER
stress may regulate ROS through up-regulation of TXNIP
and subsequently help trigger apoptosis by modulation
of mitochondrial structure and functions (Fig. 13, step
4890

2). On the other hand, TXNIP can directly activate
phosphorylation of JNK and promote apoptosis (Fig.
13, step 3). Multiple events induced by IRE1α inhibitors
including BIM activation, mitochondrial membrane
depolarization, and caspase 3 activation lead to pancreatic
cancer cell death. Our findings indicate that selective
inhibition of ER stress by IRE1α inhibitors may have a
therapeutic role in the management of pancreatic cancer.

maintained at 5% CO2 and 37°C. For induction of hypoxia,
cells were incubated in temperature-controlled hypoxic
culture chamber at 1% O2, 5% CO2, and 94% N2.

MTT assays
Three thousand cells were seeded in 96-well plates
overnight and drug treatment started the next day. After
an incubation period, MTT (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) was added to cells
and cultured at 370C for 4 hr followed by stop solution
(4 mM HCl, 0.1% Nondet P40 in isopropanol) which
was added to dissolve MTT. The plates were read with a
spectrophotometer at 590 nm absorbance with reference
at 630 nm. IC50 values were calculated using GraphPad
Prism (La Jolla, CA).

METHODS
Cell lines and cell culture
Pancreatic cancer cell lines (Panc1, Panc0203,
Panc0327, Panc0403, Panc0813, Panc1005, AsPc1,
BxPc3, MiaPaCa2, PL45, SU8686) were obtained from
ATCC (Manassas, VA). They were cultured in RPMI1640 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and

Colony formation assays
For colony formation on plastic, 800 cells were
seeded in 6-well plates overnight, and drugs were applied

to the cultured cells on the second day. After 14 days,
culture medium was removed, and cells were briefly
rinsed with PBS. Colonies were stained with crystal violet
(0.2%). For clonogenic growth in soft agar, 3,000 or
5,000 cells/well in 6-well plates were cultured in 0.35%
low melting agarose either with or without drugs on top
of a bottom layer of 0.5% agarose. Cells were cultured
for either 14 days or when the colonies were large enough
for enumeration. Colonies were stained with 1:50 Gentin
Violet for 20 min and rinsed with PBS until the colonies
were easily detected. Colonies were photographed and
counted with ImageJ (http://rsbweb.nih.gov).

potential assessment kit (SeroTec, Oxford, UK) was used
following manufacturer’s instruction. Membrane potential
was measured at 488 nm excitation and 670 nm emission
with either flow cytometer or fluorescent plate reader.
Pancreatic cancer cells [Panc1 (1x106)] seeded in 10-cm
dishes overnight, and then were treated with HNA (0, 1, 10
µM) for 24 hr. After drug treatment, cells were trypsinized,
re-suspended in TMRE working solution to a density of
1x106 cells/ml, and incubated for 20 minutes in a 37°C
CO2 incubator. After incubation, cells were analyzed with
flow cytometry. Histograms measured the proportion
of mitochondria that were depolarized as indicated by
a decrease in fluorescence. Three pancreatic cancer cell
lines (Panc1, Panc0327, Panc0403) plated in 96-well
plates were treated with drugs for 24hr, and mitochondrial
membrane potential was measured with a fluorescent
plate reader. Loss of membrane potential was detected by
comparing the fluorescence against the average 575 nm
fluorescence signal in cells.

Animal studies
BxPc3 pancreatic cancer cells (2x106 cells/100
µl) mixed with matrigel at 1:1 ratio were injected
subcutaneously into both flanks of NOD/SCID mice. Drug
treatment was started four days later. Drug (3ETH) or
control diluent (PBS) was injected intraperitoneally three
times a week for a total of four weeks. Weight and size
were measured after harvesting the tumors.

Western blot analysis
Following drug treatment, cells were directly lyzed
with lysis buffer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham,
MA) containing a protease inhibitor cocktail (Millipore,
Billerica, MA) and scraped off of the culture dishes. After
10 min incubation on ice, the lysates were centrifuged at
10,000xg for 10 min at 4°C. Total protein concentration
from the supernatants was determined by BCA assay
(BioRad Laboratories, Hercules, CA). Thirty micrograms
of protein were resolved on SDS-PAGE followed by
transfer to PVDF (Millipore). Membranes were blocked
with 5% non-fat milk and incubated with antibodies.
Antibodies were from Santa Cruz (Santa Cruz, CA), Cell
Signaling (Boston, MA), Sigma Aldrich (St. Louis, MO).
ECL reagents (GE Healthcare Life Sciences, Uppsala,
Sweden) were used to detect the proteins.

Studies of drug combination
Results from MTT assays of different combinations
of drugs were analyzed by Calcusyn (Biosoft, UK)
for cumulative effects as expressed by isobolograms.
An isobologram is a graph indicating the equipotent
combinations of different doses of two drugs. Isobologram
can clearly show additive, synergistic, or antagonistic
effects at different dose levels. A combination index
(CI) plot is a Fa-CI plot in which CI <1, =1, >1 indicate
synergism, additive effect, and antagonism, respectively.
Fa: the fraction that is inhibited by the drug.[43]
