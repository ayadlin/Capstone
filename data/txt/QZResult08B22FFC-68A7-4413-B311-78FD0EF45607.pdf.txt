Abstract
Applying advanced proteomic technologies to prospectively collected specimens from large studies is one
means of identifying preclinical changes in plasma proteins that are potentially relevant to the early detection
of diseases such as breast cancer. We conducted 14 independent quantitative proteomics experiments
comparing pooled plasma samples collected from 420 estrogen receptor–positive (ER+) breast cancer patients
≤17 months before their diagnosis and matched controls. Based on the more than 3.4 million tandem mass
spectra collected in the discovery set, 503 proteins were quantified, of which 57 differentiated cases from controls with a P value of <0.1. Seven of these proteins, for which quantitative ELISA assays were available, were
assessed in an independent validation set. Of these candidates, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) was
validated as a predictor of breast cancer risk in an independent set of preclinical plasma samples for women
overall [odds ratio (OR), 1.44; P = 0.0008] and particularly for current users of estrogen plus progestin (E + P)
menopausal hormone therapy (OR, 2.49; P = 0.0001). Among current E + P users, the EGFR sensitivity for breast
cancer risk was 31% with 90% specificity. Whereas the sensitivity and specificity of EGFR are insufficient for a
clinically useful early detection biomarker, this study suggests that proteins that are elevated preclinically in
women who go on to develop breast cancer can be discovered and validated using current proteomic technologies. Further studies are warranted to examine the role of EGFR and to discover and validate other proteins that could potentially be used for early detection of breast cancer.

Introduction
Breast cancer is a disease of considerable public health importance given that it is the most commonly diagnosed cancer in women worldwide. At present, the best available tool
for early detection of breast cancer is mammography, as it
has been shown to reduce mortality in randomized trials
(1). Despite improvements in technology and the widespread
use of mammography, breast cancer still remains the second
leading cause of cancer mortality in women in the United
States (2) and the leading cause of cancer mortality in
women worldwide (3).
Considerable effort has been invested in trying to interrogate changes related to breast cancer in biological specimens. Numerous challenges have been faced including use

of discovery platforms with poor reproducibility and interrogation of specimens collected either at or after a breast cancer diagnosis (when the specimens of greatest clinical
interest are those ascertained before diagnosis). We used advanced technologies for proteome profiling to systematically
examine changes in the plasma proteome of preclinical samples from a case-control study nested in the Women's Health
Initiative Observational Study (WHI OS) prospective cohort.
The purpose of this study was to identify proteins that may
be elevated preclinically in estrogen receptor–positive (ER+)
breast cancer cases and to validate promising candidates in
an independent sample set.

Materials and Methods
We conducted a nested case-control study within the
WHI OS prospective cohort that was approved by the Fred
Hutchinson Cancer Research Center Institutional Review
Board. The WHI OS is a prospective cohort study, and details on its scientific rationale, eligibility criteria, and design
have been published previously (4, 5). Briefly, 93,676 postmenopausal women 50 to 79 years of age were enrolled between October 1, 1993 and December 31, 1998 through 40
clinical centers in the United States. Epidemiologic data
and biological specimens were collected from participants

Elevated EGFR before Breast Cancer Diagnosis

uniformly according to standardized Institutional Review
Board–approved procedures and protocols by trained study
staff. Blood specimens were collected at two time points, at
enrollment (baseline) and at year 3 of follow-up. All participants provided written informed consent for this research
study at the time of enrollment.
Case and control identification
Cohort members completed self-administered demographic and risk factor questionnaires annually, and the
medical records of all women reporting a breast cancer
diagnosis were reviewed by a study adjudicator to verify
the diagnosis. The medical records of verified cases were
then forwarded to the WHI coordinating center for coding
of breast cancer stage, ER status, progesterone receptor
(PR) status, and histology. A total of 943 women clinically
diagnosed with invasive breast cancer within 17 months of
either their baseline or year 3 blood draw without a prior
history of breast cancer were identified. Given the heterogeneity of breast cancer and the likelihood that biomarkers for
early detection of breast cancer may be specific to certain
breast cancer types, the work described herein focused exclusively on ER+ breast cancer cases.
Potential controls were selected from a pool of women
never diagnosed with any type of cancer through September
15, 2005. Controls were individually matched 1:1 to cases on
age at enrollment (±1 year), race/ethnicity (white, black,
Hispanic, Asian/Pacific Islander, or other), blood draw date
(±1 year), and clinical center of enrollment. Matching was
done in a time-forward manner to ensure that each control
had at least as much follow-up time following her blood
draw as the time from blood draw to breast cancer diagnosis of the case to which she was matched.
Discovery studies
Fourteen independent large-scale quantitative proteomics
experiments were performed using a previously described
method (6) that used immunodepletion, isotopic labeling
with acrylamide (7), extensive fractionation (8), and highresolution tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS). Each experiment compared a pool of 300 μL of plasma from 35
prediagnostic breast cancer cases (equal volume) with a
pool of 300 μL from 35 matched controls (equal volume).
Pools of case and control plasma were immunodepleted
of the top six most abundant proteins (albumin, IgG, IgA,
transferrin, haptoglobin, and antitrypsin) using a Hu-6 column (4.6 × 250 mm, Agilent). Columns were equilibrated
with buffer A at 0.5 mL/min for 13 minutes, and pooled
plasma was injected after filtration through a 0.22-μm
syringe filter. Flow-through fractions were collected for 10
minutes at a flow rate of 0.5 mL/min with buffer A and
stored at −80°C until further use. Immunodepleted samples
were concentrated using a Centricon YM-3 device (Millipore) and rediluted in 8 mol/L urea, 30 mmol/L Tris (pH
8.5), 0.5% octyl-β-D-glucopyranoside (Roche Diagnostics).
Samples were reduced with DTT, and isotopic labeling of
cysteine residues of intact proteins was done. Pools received either the light acrylamide isotope (C12; Sigma-

www.aacrjournals.org

Aldrich) or the heavy 1,2,3-C13-acrylamide isotope (C13;
Cambridge Isotope Laboratories). Alkylation with acrylamide was performed for 1 hour at room temperature. The
pools were then mixed together for further analysis.
The combined isotopically labeled samples were separated by an automated online two-dimensional HPLC system
(Shimadzu). The combined labeled plasma samples were
separated in the first dimension by anion exchange chromatography (Poros HQ/10, 10 mm i.d. × 100 mm l; Applied
Biosystems) using an eight-step elution (0–1,000 mmol/L
NaCl) at 0.8 mL/min. Fractions from each of the eight
anion-exchange separation elution steps were automatically
transferred onto a reversed-phase column (PorosR2/10, 4.6
mm i.d. × 100 mm l; Applied Biosystems) for a second dimension of separation. A 25-minute gradient elution (5–95%
mobile phase B) was used at 2.4 mL/min. Mobile phase A
for anion-exchange chromatography consisted of 20 mmol/L
Tris (Sigma-Aldrich), 6% isopropanol (Fisher Scientific),
and 4 mol/L urea (pH 8.5); mobile phase B was the same
composition and pH as mobile phase A with 1 mol/L NaCl
(Fisher Scientific) added. Mobile phase A for reversedphase chromatography consisted of 95% water, 5% acetonitrile, and 0.1% trifluoroacetyl or trifluoroacetic acid (TFA;
Supelco); mobile phase B consisted of 90% acetonitrile,
10% water, and 0.1% TFA.
In-solution digestion was performed with lyophilized aliquots from the reversed-phase (second dimension) fractionation step. Proteins were resuspended in 0.25 mol/L urea
containing 50 mmol/L ammonium bicarbonate and 4% acetonitrile and then digested overnight at 37°C with modified
trypsin (Promega). The digestion was stopped by addition
of 10% formic acid. Aliquots were subjected to MS shotgun
analysis. Ninety-six fractions were analyzed for each experiment using a LTQ-Orbitrap (Thermo) mass spectrometer
coupled with a NanoLC-1D (Eksigent). Liquid chromatography separation was performed on a 25-cm column [Picofrit
75 μm i.d. (New Objectives), packed in-house with Magic
C18 resin] with a 90-minute linear gradient from 5% to
40% acetonitrile in 0.1% formic acid at 300 nL/min for shotgun analysis. Spectra were acquired in a data-dependent
mode over the m/z range 400 to 1,800 and included selection of the five most abundant doubly or triply charged ions
of each MS spectrum for MS/MS analysis. Mass spectrometer parameters included capillary voltage of 2.0 kV, capillary temperature of 200°C, resolution of 60,000, and target
value of 1,000,000.
Each experiment compared a set of pooled plasma samples
collected from 35 breast cancer cases to a set of pooled plasma samples from their 35 matched controls; thus, a total of
490 cases and 490 controls contributed to these discovery experiments. The characteristics of our 14 experiments are
summarized in Table 1. Eight experiments were performed
comparing plasma from ER+/PR+ ductal breast cancer patients to controls, with four experiments focusing on cases
whose blood was drawn 0 to 38 weeks before their breast cancer diagnosis and four experiments on cases whose blood was
drawn between 38 weeks and 17 months before diagnosis.
Two experiments compared ER+/PR− ductal breast cancer

patients to controls, one containing specimens collected 0 to
38 weeks before diagnosis and the other containing cases collected 38 weeks to 17 months before diagnosis. Two experiments compared ER+/PR+ lobular breast cancer patients to
controls, one containing cases collected 0 to 38 weeks before
diagnosis and the other containing cases collected 38 weeks
to 17 months before diagnosis. Lastly, two experiments compared ER−/PR− ductal breast cancer patients to controls, with
one experiment comparing cases whose blood was drawn 0
to 38 weeks before their breast cancer diagnosis and one experiment comparing cases whose blood was drawn between
38 weeks and 17 months before diagnosis. Seven of the experiments were run with the C13 (heavy) acrylamide on the
cases and with C12 (light) on the controls, and the other seven experiments had the labels reversed to account for potential artifacts of this labeling.
This pooling strategy and sample size was selected because
it is effectively equivalent to sample sizes of 255 individual
cases and 255 individual controls for our overall analysis
and 145 individual cases and 145 individual controls for the
analyses restricted to ER+ cases. With these sample sizes,
we had a >80% specificity to discover markers with an area
under the curve (AUC) of 0.6 and a sensitivity of only 20%.
Analysis of discovery data
Mass spectra were searched using Mascot against the human International Protein Index (IPI) database (v. 3.13).
Quantitative information was extracted from acrylamide labeled peptides using an in-house script (Q3) for peptides
with minimum PeptideProphet = 0.75, expect score <0.10,
and maximum fractional delta mass = 20 ppm (7). Also, because the label orientation was reversed in some experiments, we additionally required that any quantified peptide
had to be observed in both isotopic states at least once in at
least one experiment. This criterion removes spurious ratios
that arise due to misidentification. Proteins with ProteinProphet scores >0.90 were aligned by their protein group number to identify master groups of indistinguishable proteins.
The master group ratio for each experiment was set to the
geometric mean of the corresponding peptide ratios, logarithmically transformed, and median centered. Proteins that

had become defunct in IPI or were immunodepleted were
removed from the analysis. Mean log 2 ratios and moderated
P values for groups of experiments were computed using the
LIMMA package from bioconductor.org and weighted using
the number of quantitated events (peptides; ref. 9).
The validation work described here focuses on ER+ breast
cancer, and thus we selected candidate proteins from the following subsets of experiments: all cases (n = 14 experiments),
ER+ (n = 12 experiments), ER+/PR+ (n = 10 experiments), and
ER+, with blood samples collected 0 to 38 weeks before diagnosis (n = 6 experiments). Candidate proteins that were associated with a fold change ≥1.15 and a P value of <0.10 and
were quantified in at least two experiments in any one of the
subsets were chosen for validation. Of the 503 total proteins
quantified in our discovery experiments, 57 met these criteria
and are listed in Supplementary Table S1. More stringent statistical criteria were not applied to our discovery data to
make our candidate lists more inclusive, given our plan to
use a rigorous validation to identify the false positives while
not discarding potential true positives that could be missed
by use of more stringent criteria.
Validation assays
Of the 57 top ranked candidates, we selected 7 for which
an ELISA assay was readily available for validation. Assays
were performed according to directions provided by the
various manufacturers. ELISA reagents for EGFR, IGFBP1,
and NOV were obtained from R&D Systems. ELISA kits
for FN1, LTF, and VWF were purchased from Bendermed
Systems, Calbiochem, and Assaypro, respectively. TFF3 assays were performed using commercial reagents based on
a previously described procedure (10). All samples were assayed in duplicate blinded to case/control status. We conducted two rounds of ELISA validation assays. The first
round included preclinical plasma samples from 105
women who were later diagnosed with invasive ER+ breast
cancer and their matched controls not used in our discovery experiments and involved assessment of all seven candidates. The second round included preclinical plasma
samples from 93 women who were later diagnosed with invasive ER+ breast cancer and their matched controls not

used in either our discovery experiments or the first-round
validation. This second-round validation focused only on
EGFR and TFF3 based on the promising data generated
from the first-round validation as an effort to strengthen
our validation conclusions in an additional independent
set. A sample size of ∼100 cases and ∼100 controls was
selected for each round of validation because it provided
70% power to characterize a marker with an AUC of 0.60
and a sensitivity of 20%, and 99% power to characterize a
marker with an AUC of 0.65 and a sensitivity of 30%.
Statistical methods
ELISA measurements above and below the detection limit
for assays were imputed by the maximum and minimum
computable values for the assay. All statistical analyses were

and were standardized such that the mean value and SD of
the control group of each set of assays were set to 0 and 1,
respectively. Multivariate logistic regression was used to
compute odds ratios (OR), P values, and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) comparing cases to controls. All ORs were
adjusted for the following potential confounders: age, time
between blood draw and cancer diagnosis for cases/matched
reference date for controls, race/ethnicity, body mass index
(BMI) at baseline, and first-degree family history of breast
cancer. Analyses stratified by recency of menopausal hormone therapy use at the time of blood draw [never/former
user, current unopposed estrogen (E) user, current estrogen
plus progestin (E + P) user] were conducted. Of these covariates, BMI was measured and family history of breast cancer
and use of menopausal hormone therapy were self-reported.

Although the ORs and P values for EGFR, FN1, IGFBP1, LTF,
NOV, TFF3, and VWF did not necessarily place them near the
top of our overall candidate list, they were selected for validation based on the fact that these were the only candidates
with commercially available ELISA assays.
The overall results of our first round of ELISA validations
on 105 cases and 105 controls are shown in Table 3. Overall,
levels of EGFR significantly differentiated cases from controls (OR, 1.64; P = 0.002), whereas levels of FN1, IGFBP1,
LTF, TFF3, NOV, and VWF did not. Although the multivariate adjusted ORs estimated from our ELISA validation are
not directly comparable to the fold changes calculated
from our discovery data using pooled samples, the EGFR
discovery and validation data are consistent in showing
that EGFR levels are on average higher in cases compared
with controls. Menopausal hormone therapy has been
shown to affect a significant portion of the serum proteome (6). For this reason, we stratified our validation

In analyses where samples were paired, the time to diagnosis
for a healthy control was set to that of her matched case.

Results
In both the discovery and validation sets, cases and controls had similar frequencies of first-degree family history of
breast cancer, but cases were somewhat more likely to be
current E + P users and to be overweight/obese (BMI ≥
25.0 kg/m2) and less likely to have had a hysterectomy compared with controls (Table 2).
The discovery experiments acquired 3,412,733 tandem
mass spectra from which 3,154 proteins were identified and
assigned to 1,491 groups of indistinguishable proteins. Acrylamide labels cysteine-containing peptides, and thus only 603
of the protein groups had measurable ratios. After removing
proteins that were either immunodepleted or had defunct IPI
entries, 503 protein groups remained for statistical analysis.

results according to use of menopausal hormone therapy
(never/former users, current E users, and current E + P
users). The first-round validation data suggested that EGFR
levels were elevated in both current E users and current
E + P users (Table 4). In addition, the data suggested that
whereas TFF3 levels did not distinguish cases from controls, TFF3 levels were higher in current menopausal hor-

mone therapy users compared with never/former users
regardless of case/control status. E users had an OR of
2.15 (P < 0.001) compared with never/former users, whereas E + P users had an OR of 1.90 (P < 0.001) compared
with never/former users. Associations with the other proteins assessed in our first round of ELISA validations were
not influenced by use of menopausal hormones.
To further validate these findings, a second-round validation was conducted where the finding that EGFR levels
were elevated in cases compared with controls who were
E + P users was replicated (Table 4). Combining data from
both validation rounds, EGFR levels were elevated in cases
versus controls among all women (OR, 1.44; 95% CI, 1.16–
1.79), particularly among E + P users (OR, 2.49; 95% CI,
1.56–3.99). We used logistic regression modeling to test
whether differences in the ORs across menopausal hormone therapy use subgroups were statistically different.
The P value comparing the ORs among current E + P
users to never/former users was 0.0019, and the P value
comparing current E + P users to current E users was
0.12. We also evaluated risk of breast cancer by quartile
of EGFR levels. Overall, women in the highest EGFR quartile had a 2.90-fold (95% CI, 1.60–5.32) increased risk of
developing breast cancer compared with those in the lowest quartile, but among current E + P users, those in the
highest EGFR quartile had a 9.04-fold (95% CI, 2.78–33.21)
increased risk (Table 5). The performance characteristics of
EGFR in women taking E + P hormone therapy are shown
in Fig. 1. The receiver operating characteristic curve has an
AUC of 0.7. At 80% specificity, the sensitivity of EGFR as a
single marker is 56%, and at 90% specificity, its sensitivity

is 31%. Of note, these risk estimates did not vary by breast
cancer stage. Combining data from the two rounds of
ELISA assays, EGFR was elevated overall among women
who went on to be diagnosed with both localized (OR,
1.39; 95% CI, 1.09–1.78) and regional/distant disease (OR,
1.75; 95% CI, 1.04–2.92) and among current E + P users
who went on to be diagnosed with both localized (OR,
2.52; 95% CI, 1.37–4.64) and regional/distant disease (OR,
2.84; 95% CI, 1.03–7.80).

The peptide sequence coverage for EGFR in the discovery
experiments is shown in Fig. 2A. EGFR is a transmembrane
protein, and the peptides identified by MS are all located on
the extracellular region. The TFF3 peptides observed in the
discovery work are shown in Fig. 2B. TFF3 is a small secreted
protein, and the sequence coverage suggests that we are observing the intact form of the secreted protein.
In our second-round validation, we also replicated our
TFF3 results. When we combined data from both validation

rounds, TFF3 levels were elevated among both unopposed
estrogen users (OR, 2.17; P < 0.001) and E + P users (OR,
1.93; P < 0.001) compared with never/former users.

Discussion
There is paucity of breast cancer proteomic studies
that have used prediagnostic blood samples. From a list
of candidates identified by a high-dimensional MS-based
discovery approach, we attempted to validate a handful
of proteins that were not particularly highly ranked but
met particular statistical criteria and had an available
ELISA assay that could readily be used for validation.
Of the seven proteins assessed, EGFR may have some utility as an indicator of breast cancer risk before diagnosis,
particularly among current E + P users, based on its high
statistical significance in our validation set. However, its
performance with respect to its sensitivity and specificity
is insufficient for it to serve as a single early detection
marker.
We found that EGFR had an AUC of 0.70; at 80% specificity, its sensitivity is 56%, and at 90% specificity, its sensitivity is 31%. In comparison, prostate-specific antigen,
which is clinically used to screen men for prostate cancer,
has an AUC of 0.68; at 81.1% specificity, its sensitivity is
40.5%, and at 93.8% specificity, its sensitivity is 20.5% (11).
Whereas EGFR is insufficient as a stand-alone early detection marker, its utility as a risk factor in conjunction with
mammography has yet to be determined. For example,
more frequent mammography among E + P users with elevated EGFR levels could potentially be useful for detecting
breast cancer earlier among these women, but this needs to
be formally evaluated.
EGFR is a cell surface tyrosine kinase receptor and is a
member of the ERBB proto-oncogene family, which also includes HER2. The identification of extracellular peptides
and no transmembrane or intracellular peptides by MS in
our discovery IPAS experiments suggests shedding of the
EGFR extracellular domain by cells. EGFR is involved in
numerous cancer-relevant pathways involving cell proliferation, survival, differentiation, and migration, and binding
of EGFR by various ligands can result in increased uncontrolled proliferation of cancer cells (12, 13). Further, EGFR
is overexpressed in 20% to 81% of breast tumors (14–16).
Several studies have measured blood levels of EGFR in relation to breast cancer, although overall, the results are
quite inconsistent. It is difficult to directly compare the results of these studies to ours because none involved measurements of EGFR in the preclinical period before a breast
cancer patient's diagnosis. Among women with hormone
receptor–positive disease, serum EGFR levels decreased significantly after 1 and 3 months of letrozole therapy versus
pretreatment conditions (17). Reduction in serum levels of
EGFR in postoperative breast cancer cases compared with
preoperative cases has been shown to correlate with disease-free survival (18). Whereas EGFR is involved in hormonal pathways relevant to breast cancer, there is no
clear explanation at this point for why EGFR may be useful

www.aacrjournals.org

for the early detection of breast cancer primarily among
E + P users, but not among either E users or never/former
users. Thus, further investigations of the potential utility of
EGFR as an indication of increased risk of breast cancer
are warranted.
TFF3 is a small stable secreted protein that is predominantly expressed in the gastrointestinal tract as well as in
a variety of other normal tissues and tumors. TFF3 has
been shown to be estrogen responsive at both the gene
and protein levels. The gene encoding TFF3 contains a palindromic estrogen response element that is conserved between human and mouse (19). We have recently shown an
association between proteins containing estrogen response
elements in the upstream region of their gene sequence,
such as TFF3, and increased serum levels when comparing
women taking oral estrogen treatment after 1 year compared with baseline (6). Our observation that TFF3 levels
are elevated in current E and current E + P users compared with never/former users is consistent with this work.
Although TFF3 was upregulated in our discovery work, this
was likely due to the imbalance in hormone therapy use in
cases compared with controls (58.9% versus 48.8% were
current users) in our discovery experiments.
Of the seven proteins we attempted to validate, EGFR
was the only one that showed statistically significant differences in overall levels for cases compared with controls.
The likely primary reason why we failed to validate the
other candidates is that all of them had a relatively high false
discovery rate, as we used fairly broad statistical criteria when
including candidates on our list of those warranting further
follow-up. The primary limitation of this study is the lack of
readily available means to validate the numerous other candidates we discovered, most of which were much more compelling candidates based on their discovery ORs, P values, and
false discovery rates.
Whereas EGFR alone cannot be viewed as clinically useful for early detection of breast cancer, our validation of
increased EGFR levels as an indication of increased risk
for ER+ breast cancer specific to E + P users is important
in two respects. First, no prior studies have validated even
a single biomarker for early detection of breast cancer in
preclinical specimens to the degree we have done in this
study, validating increased EGFR levels in two completely
independent validation sets. Second, consideration of other
exposures in biomarker discovery studies is likely critical
given that although overall EGFR was not found to distinguish cases from controls among E + P users, it is highly
statistically significant. Thus, incorporation of factors such
as use of hormone therapy, which has been shown to have
a major effect on the plasma proteome (6), is critical in
this type of work. Future work aimed at discovering and
validating preclinical changes related to breast cancer is
needed, and our EGFR finding warrants further replication
and study.
