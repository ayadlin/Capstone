ABSTRACT
Bcl-2 inhibits apoptosis by two distinct mechanisms but only one is targeted to
treat Bcl-2-positive malignancies. In this mechanism, the BH1-3 domains of Bcl-2 form
a hydrophobic pocket, binding and inhibiting pro-apoptotic proteins, including Bim. In
the other mechanism, the BH4 domain mediates interaction of Bcl-2 with inositol 1,4,
5-trisphosphate receptors (IP3Rs), inhibiting pro-apoptotic Ca2+ signals. The current
anti-Bcl-2 agents, ABT-263 (Navitoclax) and ABT-199 (Venetoclax), induce apoptosis
by displacing pro-apoptotic proteins from the hydrophobic pocket, but do not inhibit
Bcl-2-IP3R interaction. Therefore, to target this interaction we developed BIRD-2
(Bcl-2 IP3 Receptor Disruptor-2), a decoy peptide that binds to the BH4 domain,
blocking Bcl-2-IP3R interaction and thus inducing Ca2+-mediated apoptosis in chronic
lymphocytic leukemia, multiple myeloma, and follicular lymphoma cells, including cells
resistant to ABT-263, ABT-199, or the Bruton’s tyrosine kinase inhibitor Ibrutinib.
Moreover, combining BIRD-2 with ABT-263 or ABT-199 enhances apoptosis induction
compared to single agent treatment. Overall, these findings provide strong rationale
for developing novel therapeutic agents that mimic the action of BIRD-2 in targeting
the BH4 domain of Bcl-2 and disrupting Bcl-2-IP3R interaction.

apoptosis regulating proteins composed of one or more
Bcl-2 homology (BH) domains [3, 4]. Bcl-2 has four BH
domains (BH1-4), typical of most anti-apoptotic family
members, while pro-apoptotic family members lack the
BH4 domain and have only BH1-3 domains (e.g., Bax,
Bak). Another subset of pro-apoptotic family members has
only a BH3 domain (e.g., Bim). These BH3-only proteins
act as sentinels of cell stress that activate Bax or Bak,
which in turn trigger apoptosis by permeabilizing the outer
mitochondrial membrane and releasing cytochrome c.

INTRODUCTION
The Bcl-2 protein is elevated in a variety of
types of cancer, including those derived by malignant
transformation of B-lymphocytes: chronic lymphocytic
leukemia (CLL), follicular lymphoma (FL), and multiple
myeloma (MM) [1]. Bcl-2 elevation contributes to
apoptosis resistance in malignant cells, a hallmark of
cancer that represents a major hurdle in cancer treatment
[2]. Bcl-2 is the founding member of a large family of

Bcl-2 binds these pro-apoptotic BH3-only family
members, thereby inhibiting apoptosis.
A major advance in cancer treatment is the
development of the BH3 mimetic agents ABT-737, its
orally bioavailable analog ABT-263 (Navitoclax), and
ABT-199 (Venetoclax) [5, 6]. These small molecules
competitively inhibit BH3-only protein binding by Bcl-2,
inducing apoptosis in cells addicted to Bcl-2 elevation for
survival [7]. The most recent, ABT-199, selectively targets
Bcl-2 and shows considerable promise for treatment of a
wide range of Bcl-2-positive malignancies [6–9].
But interaction of Bcl-2 with BH3-only proteins is
not the only way Bcl-2 represses apoptosis. Bcl-2 also
binds to the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors (IP3Rs),
Ca2+ channels located on the endoplasmic reticulum (ER),
preventing high amplitude intracellular Ca2+ elevations
that trigger cell death [10, 11]. Bcl-2 accomplishes
this by docking the Ca2+-activated protein phosphatase
calcineurin and the calcineurin-regulated inhibitor of
protein phosphatase 1, DARPP-32, to IP3Rs. This complex
forms a negative feedback loop that senses excessive
Ca2+ release and rapidly decreases IP3R phosphorylation,
thereby decreasing IP3R-mediated Ca2+ release and thus
preventing apoptosis [12].
Distinct regions of the Bcl-2 protein govern these
disparate mechanisms of apoptosis regulation. BH
domains 1-3 participate in forming a hydrophobic pocket
in which pro-apoptotic proteins are bound [3]. The BH3
mimetic agents induce apoptosis by binding in this pocket
and displacing pro-apoptotic proteins [4]. On the other
hand, the BH4 domain of Bcl-2 mediates the binding of
Bcl-2 to IP3Rs [13, 14].
Currently there is no therapeutic agent designed to
target the BH4 domain of Bcl-2. Therefore, to selectively
target Bcl-2-IP3R interaction, we developed a synthetic
peptide corresponding to the IP3R binding site for Bcl2 [15]. This peptide disrupts Bcl-2-IP3R interaction,
reversing Bcl-2′s inhibition of IP3-induced Ca2+ elevation
and decreasing cell survival, without disturbing the
binding of pro-apoptotic proteins by Bcl-2 [13, 15].
Elimination of a potential protease cleavage site produced
a more potent version of this peptide capable of inducing
Ca2+-mediated apoptosis in primary human CLL cells (but
not in normal human lymphocytes) [16] and in diffuse
large B-cell lymphoma cell lines [17]. Here we call this
peptide BIRD-2 (Bcl-2-IP3R Disruptor-2). BIRD-2 binds
directly to the BH4 domain of Bcl-2, functioning as a
decoy peptide to competitively inhibit Bcl-2 interaction
with IP3Rs, reversing Bcl-2′s control over IP3R-mediated
Ca2+ release and thereby inducing high amplitude
intracellular Ca2+ elevations that trigger apoptosis [14, 16].
Knowledge that Bcl-2 inhibits apoptosis by two
distinct validated pathways involving separate regions of
the Bcl-2 protein suggests that targeting the BH4 domain
of Bcl-2 should be undertaken as a novel therapeutic
strategy. But whether or not this approach might represent
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

a potential therapeutic gain in view of the already
established approach to targeting Bcl-2 with BH3 mimetic
agents has not been tested. Therefore, the present work
was undertaken in which we employ a series of human
myeloma cell lines (HMCLs) to compare responses to
BIRD-2 and ABT-263/ABT-199. The findings indicate for
the first time that BIRD-2 induces apoptosis both in vitro
and in vivo. Also, we find that treatment of HMCLs with
BIRD-2 together with ABT-263/ABT-199 enhances cell
killing. This combined activity extends to FL cells as well.
Moreover, we demonstrate that BIRD-2 induces apoptosis
in HMCLs resistant to both ABT-263/ABT-199 and to the
Bruton’s tyrosine kinase (Btk) inhibitor Ibrutinib. Overall,
the findings of the present report provide strong rationale
for developing novel therapeutic agents that mimic the
action of BIRD-2 in targeting the BH4 domain of Bcl-2.

RESULTS
BIRD-2 activity in vitro and in vivo in HMCLs
An MTS assay was used to compare the BIRD-2
sensitivity of primary human CLL cells with cell lines
representing various other lymphoid malignancies and
transformed lines of non-malignant derivation in relation
to sensitivity to BIRD-2ctrl, a control peptide derived
from BIRD-2 sequence. The MTS assay determines
NAD(P)H-dependent cellular oxidoreductase activity as
a measure of cell viability. Cell lines corresponding to
B-cell lymphoid malignancies, including MM and B-cell
lymphoma, were generally more sensitive to BIRD2 than lines corresponding to T-cell malignancies and
non-malignant cell lines (Figure 1A). The six HMCLs
demonstrate a range of sensitivities to BIRD-2, as
observed with primary human CLL cells (Figure 1A).
Dose responses for the two most sensitive HMCLs,
NCI-H929 and JJN-3, and the two least sensitive HMCLs,
KMS-12-BM and RPMI-8226, are shown in Figure 1B
and Figure 1C, respectively.
The differential sensitivity of NCI-H929 and
KMS-12-BM cells to 10 μM BIRD-2 treatment for 24
hours, as measured by MTS assay (Figure 2A, 2B), is
substantiated by quantifying the percentage of apoptotic
nuclei developing after BIRD-2 treatment (Figure
2C, 2D). The BIRD-2-mediated decline in survival is
accompanied by a larger dose-dependent increase in the
percentage of NCI-H929 cells exhibiting apoptotic nuclear
chromatin condensation than observed in KMS-12-BM
cells. The findings indicate that KMS-12-BM cells are
not completely resistant to BIRD-2, but require a much
higher concentration of BIRD-2 than NCI-H929 cells to
achieve a similar degree of apoptosis. In addition, we find
that BIRD-2 treatment also induces PARP cleavage and
caspase-3 activation in NCI-H929 cells, providing further
evidence of apoptosis induction by BIRD-2 (Figure 2E).
Consistent with these findings, treatment of NCI-H929

cells with BIRD-2 causes activation and oligomerization
of the mitochondrial membrane-localized pro-apoptotic
protein Bax, which permeabilizes the mitochondrial outer
membrane during apoptosis initiation. This finding is
evident in cells treated with BIRD-2 or the positive control
staurosporine by the formation of perinuclear puncta
detected with the Bax 6A7 antibody, which specifically
recognizes the conformationally active form of Bax
(Figure 3A). Moreover, pretreatment with the caspase
inhibitor Z-VAD-FMK protects NCI-H929 cells from
BIRD-2-induced formation of apoptotic nuclei (Figure
3B) and cell death measured by the CellTiter-Glo (CTG)
assay, which quantifies ATP levels as a measure of cell
viability (Figure 3C). These findings indicate that the cell
death induced by BIRD-2 is primarily caspase-dependent.
To examine the anti-tumor effect of BIRD-2 on HMCLs
in vivo, NCI-H929 cells were inoculated subcutaneously into
the flank regions of nude mice. Once tumors had become
visible, tumor-bearing mice were injected with either BIRD2 or saline at the site of tumors. Administration of 10 mg/kg
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

BIRD-2 every 2-3 days for a total of four injections caused
a significant reduction in tumor growth rate compared to the
control group (Figure 4A, 4B). Furthermore, injection of
BIRD-2 inhibited end-point tumor weight to less than 50%
compared to the control group (Figure 4C). Notably, there
was not a significant difference in body weight between the
two treatment groups, suggesting that BIRD-2 injection does
not cause apparent toxicity in mice (Figure 4D). Together,
these findings indicate that percutaneous injection of BIRD-2
penetrates tissue through diffusion and inhibits tumor growth
without inducing immediate recognizable toxicity in mice and
provide evidence of in vivo single-agent activity of targeting
Bcl-2′s BH4 domain.

that BIRD-2 is capable of inducing death in HMCLs that
are resistant to both the BH3 mimetic agents ABT-263 and
ABT-199 and to the Btk inhibitor Ibrutinib. Moreover, the
findings suggest a reciprocal sensitivity of HMCLs to

BIRD-2 versus ABT-263/199, consistent with the different
mechanisms of action of these agents.
The Bcl-2 family protein Bim is a key mediator of
apoptosis in lymphoid malignancies [18, 19]. As a BH3only protein, Bim levels contribute to differential sensitivity
of cells to BH3 mimetic agents by priming Bcl-2-positive
cells for death [20]. Therefore, in order to explore
differences in sensitivity of the HMCLs to BH3 mimetic
agents, we compared expression levels of Bim in these
cells. We find that Bim protein is expressed highly in the
BH3 mimetic-sensitive HMCLs, whereas Bim expression
is low in the BH3 mimetic agent-resistant NCI-H929 and
JJN-3 lines (Figure 6A). By comparison, Bcl-2 and Mcl-1
are expressed at varying levels (Figure 6A).
Moreover, we observe that in highly BIRD-2sensitive NCI-H929 cells, BIRD-2 induces elevation
of Bim protein and mRNA, while Bcl-2 mRNA and
protein levels are essentially unchanged (Figure 6B,
6C). On the other hand, in KMS-12-BM cells, basal
Bim levels are already high and change little following
BIRD-2 treatment (Figure 6D). As shown in earlier
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

work, disruption of Bcl-2-IP3R interaction by BIRD-2
induces IP3R-mediated Ca2+ elevation [12, 15–17]
(Figure 6E, left). Adding the Ca2+ chelators EGTA and
BAPTA-AM to cells prior to BIRD-2 treatment inhibits
BIRD-2-mediated Ca2+ elevation (Figure 6E, right)
and Bim elevation (Figure 6F), and prevents BIRD-2induced formation of apoptotic nuclei and loss of cell
viability (Figure 6G, 6H). Therefore, BIRD-2-induced
Bim elevation in NCI-H929 cells is Ca2+-mediated,
consistent with earlier evidence of a role for Ca2+-induced
transcriptional elevation of Bim in lymphocyte cell death
[21]. Moreover, these findings demonstrate that the cell
death induced by BIRD-2 is largely Ca2+-dependent.

Combining BIRD-2 with BH3 mimetic agents
The observation that BIRD-2 treatment elevates
Bim mRNA and protein without elevating Bcl-2 raises
the possibility that BIRD-2 may sensitize HMCLs to BH3
mimetic agents by increasing the ratio of Bim to Bcl-2.
Therefore, we treated HMCLs with BIRD-2 in conjunction

with BH3 mimetic agents. In ABT-263-sensitive RPMI8226 cells, dual treatment with BIRD-2 and ABT-263
enhanced cell death induction compared to either agent alone
(Figure 7A). Moreover, co-treatment with BIRD-2 and ABT263 also enhanced cell death induction in ABT-263/ABT199-resistant cells as shown for NCI-H929 cells in Figure 7B.
This effect was observed most notably at concentrations
of BIRD-2 and ABT-263 that caused little single agent
cell death (Figure 7B). To test the potential of combining
BIRD-2 with ABT-199, highly ABT-199-sensitive KMS12-PE cells (ABT-199 EC50 60 nM) and highly ABT-199resistant U266 cells (ABT-199 EC50 > 40 μM) were treated
with both agents. Combined treatment with BIRD-2 and
ABT-199 augmented cell death induction in both KMS-12PE and U266 HMCLs compared to single agent treatment
(Figure 7C, 7D). These findings indicate that dual treatment
with BIRD-2 and ABT-263 or ABT-199 enhances cell death
induction in a range of HMCLs exhibiting both sensitivity
and resistance to BH3 mimetic agents.
A similar approach was taken in the WSU-FSCCL
human FL cell line, which exhibits the characteristic
t(14;18) chromosomal translocation responsible for
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

elevated Bcl-2 expression in FL [22] (Figure 8). As in
HMCLs, cytotoxicity (Figure 8A) and apoptosis (Figure
8B, 8C) are increased when BIRD-2 and ABT-199 are
combined, providing evidence that BIRD-2 functions
together with BH3 mimetic agents in other Bcl-2-positive
malignancies in addition to MM.

DISCUSSION
Bcl-2 inhibits apoptosis by two disparate
mechanisms [10, 11] (Figure 9). On the one hand, Bcl-2
binds BH3-only pro-apoptotic proteins and prevents them
from inducing apoptosis; BH3 mimetic agents, such as
ABT-263 and ABT-199, inhibit this mechanism. On the
other hand, Bcl-2 binds IP3Rs and prevents Ca2+ elevation
capable of inducing apoptosis (Figure 9). This mechanism
and its inhibition by BIRD-2 are summarized elsewhere
[10]. Here we extend our earlier work indicating that
BIRD-2 induces apoptosis in primary human CLL cells
[16] by showing for the first time that BIRD-2 also induces
apoptosis in MM and FL cells. Moreover, we demonstrate
that BIRD-2 treatment induces Bax activation and cell

using MTS assay. B. HMCLs were treated for 24 hr with a range of concentrations of ABT-263. Findings indicate that KMS-12-BM and

concentrations of ABT-199. Findings indicate that KMS-12-BM cells are much more sensitive to ABT-199 than are NCI-H929, JJN-3 and
RPMI-8226 cells. In panels A–C, cell viability was measured by CellTiter-Glo Assay, performed in triplicate in at least three experiments

death that is in large part Ca2+- and caspase-dependent.
Perhaps even more importantly, the present work indicates
that BIRD-2 induces apoptosis in MM cells insensitive to
ABT-263, ABT-199, and/or Ibrutinib.
The resistance of certain HMCLs to ABT-263
and ABT-199 in the present study is not surprising, as
work by other investigators indicates that only a subset
of HMCLs are sensitive to BH3 mimetic agents [23,
24]. The observation that BIRD-2 kills BH3 mimetic
agent-resistant HMCLs is fully consistent with the dual
mechanisms of Bcl-2 action illustrated in Figure 9 and
provides strong rationale for developing therapeutic agents
that mimic the action of BIRD-2. Moreover, these findings
indicate that two separate types of addiction to Bcl-2 exist
among malignant cells: one dependent on Bcl-2′s BH1-3
domain for binding and sequestering of pro-apoptotic
BH3-only proteins (vulnerable to BH3 mimetic agents)
[7, 8], and the other dependent on Bcl-2′s BH4 domain for
binding IP3Rs and inhibiting pro-apoptotic Ca2+ elevations
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

(vulnerable to BIRD-2). Therefore, fully understanding
and targeting the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2-IP3R interaction
in addition to Bcl-2-BH3-only protein interaction should
enable more complete interference with Bcl-2, a critical
defense mechanism of malignant cells against apoptosis.
Because Bcl-2′s dual anti-apoptotic mechanisms
are so different from each other, it theoretically should
be possible to achieve a better therapeutic action by
combining agents targeting each of the mechanisms.
Indeed, the findings of the present work suggest that
combinations of BIRD-2 and either ABT-263 or ABT-199
induce more cell death than either agent alone, in both
HMCLs and in t(14;18)-positive FL cells. Moreover,
the observation that BIRD-2 treatment elevates Bim
without elevating Bcl-2 suggests that BIRD-2 may
sensitize cells to BH3 mimetic agents. The BH3-only
protein Bim is already known to play an important role
in mediating apoptosis of malignant lymphocytes [20,
25–28]. Furthermore, when basal Bim levels are elevated,

malignant cells can become addicted to Bcl-2 for its ability
to bind Bim and prevent it from inducing apoptosis [7, 8].
BH3 mimetic agents induce apoptosis by displacing Bim
from Bcl-2 [7, 8]. Cells with high levels of both Bcl-2 and
Bim are primed for cell death induction by BH3 mimetic
agents. Consistent with this, HMCLs found in the present
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

work to be killed by ABT-263 or ABT-199 have high levels
of Bim, whereas the HMCLs resistant to BH3 mimetic
agents have low levels of Bim. Combining BIRD-2 with
ABT-263 or ABT-199 may be particularly advantageous,
we propose, since BIRD-2 treatment elevates cytoplasmic
Ca2+, which in turn elevates Bim levels. In short, certain

HMCLs are primed to respond to BH3 mimetic agents
because they contain a high concentration of BH3-only
proteins like Bim that are sequestered by highly expressed
Bcl-2. In HMCLs with relatively low basal levels of Bim,
there are too few BH3-only proteins to be released from
Bcl-2 and mediate cell death in response to BH3 mimetic
agents unless they are also treated with BIRD-2, which
elevates Bim levels, thus priming the cells for sensitivity
to BH3 mimetic agents.
By interacting with IP3Rs, we posit that Bcl-2
regulates a key pro-survival signaling pathway in many
B-cell malignancies, driven by elevated expression and/or
activity of Btk. Btk phosphorylates and thereby activates
phospholipase C gamma (PLCγ), leading to protein
kinase C (PKC) activation through the generation of
diacylglycerol (DAG) [29]. Novel therapeutic agents that
inhibit Btk, such as Ibrutinib, inhibit survival pathways
including PI3K/AKT and the PKC-mediated MAPK and
NFκB pathways, decreasing the proliferation and survival
of B-cell malignancies [30–32]. Ibrutinib has recently been
approved for use in B-cell malignancies CLL and mantle
cell lymphoma, is currently in phase II clinical trials for
use in MM [33, 34], and is rapidly becoming one of the
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

most effective targeted agents for B-cell malignancies [35].
However, Ibrutinib resistance is emerging [36, 37], which
results most often from Ibrutinib binding site mutations in
Btk or gain-of-function mutations in PLCγ [38–40], both
of which lead to increased signaling flux through PLCγ.
Importantly, since PLCγ produces IP3 concurrently with
DAG, a consequence of Ibrutinib resistance is likely to be
increased IP3 generation, with the expected result being
increased IP3R-dependent Ca2+ elevation, were it not for
the inhibitory presence of Bcl-2 on IP3Rs. Therefore,
we anticipate that BIRD-2 might overcome Ibrutinib
resistance by displacing Bcl-2 from IP3Rs and inducing
Ca2+ elevation and apoptosis downstream of hyperactive
PLCγ. Although this hypothesis has not been formally
tested, our observation that BIRD-2 robustly induces
apoptosis in NCI-H929 and JJN-3 cells, two HMCLs
resistant to Ibrutinib, is consistent with the concept
that BIRD-2 may be effective in some situations where
Ibrutinib is not. These findings are intriguing since both
Btk and Bcl-2 are highly expressed in B-cell malignancies,
including MM [1, 33, 35–41].
Similar to our findings using BIRD-2 in combination
with ABT-263/ABT-199, we observed that co-treatment of

HMCLs with BIRD-2 and Ibrutinib enhanced cell killing,
most notably when treated continuously with Ibrutinib
at concentrations greater than 1 μM (data not shown).
We additionally tested a more stringent Ibrutinib dosing
schedule comprised of short-term treatment (2 hours) with
low dose Ibrutinib (1 μM) followed by Ibrutinib washout
and addition of BIRD-2. Under these conditions, there
was no enhancement of cell killing by dual treatment with
Ibrutinib and BIRD-2 compared to BIRD-2 treatment
alone (data not shown). Given that Ibrutinib potently and
irreversibly inhibits Btk at concentrations well below
1  μM [42] and that clinical Ibrutinib dosing schedules
in patients result in full occupancy of the Btk binding
site by Ibrutinib for at least 24 hours post-treatment
[43], the more stringent Ibrutinib dosing schedule would
be expected to completely inhibit Btk throughout the
experiment period at a dose of 1 μM. Taken together,
these results suggest that the enhancement of cell killing
observed following co-treatment of HMCLs with BIRD2 and Ibrutinib at Ibrutinib concentrations above 1 μM
may be due to effects of Ibrutinib on targets other than
Btk. Intriguingly, Ibrutinib is known to inhibit a variety
of kinases in addition to Btk [42, 44, 45], indicating that
BIRD-2 may be effective in combination with inhibitors
of kinases other than Btk.
We initially employed HMCLs in the present
work as a tool for investigating Bcl-2′s dual antiapoptotic mechanisms and the effects of targeting these
mechanisms with either BIRD-2 or BH3 mimetic agents
alone, or in combination. At the same time, our findings
provide rationale for treating MM and also FL with
agents that target Bcl-2-IP3R interaction, alone or in
combination with BH3 mimetic agents. Success in this
regard should have a major impact, since both MM and
FL remain challenging, incurable malignancies despite
a number of recent therapeutic advances [46–48]. Bcl-2
is expressed in MM cells at levels comparable to FL,
even though MM cells lack the t(14;18) translocation
responsible for elevating Bcl-2 in FL cells [41]. In some
but not all HMCLs and primary patient samples the BH3
mimetic ABT-737 induces apoptosis as a single agent
and also demonstrates synergistic activity with various
chemotherapeutic agents [49–51]. Recent studies also
indicate responsiveness of a small subset of HMCLs
and primary patient samples to the Bcl-2 selective BH3
mimetic agent ABT-199 [23]. However, ABT resistance
is present in more than half of primary MM samples
treated with ABT-737 and ABT-199 [23, 52]. Here we
find that BIRD-2 induces apoptosis in HMCLs resistant
to BH3 mimetic agents ABT-263 and ABT-199 and to
the Btk inhibitor Ibrutinib; moreover, one of the BIRD-2sensitive lines, NCI-H929, corresponds to a MM subgroup
that is not only resistant to BH3 mimetic agents but also
belongs to a poor prognosis MM category associated with
a t(4;14) chromosomal translocation [24]. Therefore, the
findings of the present study offer hope that developing
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

therapeutic agents that mimic the action of BIRD-2 will
have a major effect in treating MM, either as single agents
or in combination with BH3 mimetic agents.
Since discovering that Bcl-2 interacts with IP3Rs to
regulate IP3-mediated Ca2+ elevation in lymphoma cells
[53], our intention has been to target this interaction for
cancer treatment. Broad interest in the role of IP3Rs and
Ca2+ signaling in cancer has emerged, including added
evidence that cancer cells remodel Ca2+ signaling through
IP3Rs to promote migration, tissue invasion, proliferation
and survival [54, 55]. Moreover, certain cancers are
associated with the up- or down-regulation of specific Ca2+
channels or pumps, leading to the proposal that because
Ca2+ channels, pumps and exchangers are modulated by
pharmacological agents, they may be targeted for cancer
treatment [56]. Also, recent reports indicate that levels of
particular IP3R isoforms may serve as potential biomarkers
of prognosis or therapeutic response in hematologic
malignancies [17, 57].
In conclusion, the findings reported here provide an
impetus for targeting Bcl-2-IP3R interaction with drugs
that mimic the action of BIRD-2. We anticipate that this
novel therapeutic strategy will be most effective when
combined with ABT-263 or ABT-199, thus inhibiting both
of Bcl-2′s anti-apoptotic mechanisms.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell culture
Human leukemia, lymphoma, and MM cell lines
were cultured in RPMI-1640 media with 10% FBS.
Murine fibroblast 3T3 cells and human embryonic kidney
HEK293T cells were cultured in DMEM media with
10% FBS. Each medium was supplemented with 100 μM
nonessential amino acids, 2 mM L-glutamine, and in MM
lines 1 mM sodium pyruvate. Primary human chronic
lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cells were isolated from
peripheral blood of adult patients with CLL as previously
described [16]. The use of de-identified human subject
samples was approved by the institutional review board
of Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine.

Reagents
Hoechst 33342 and Fura-2-AM were purchased
from Life Technologies. Z-VAD-FMK was purchased
from BIOMOL. ABT-263, ABT-199, and Ibrutinib
(all from Selleck) were prepared in DMSO. Peptides
were synthesized by GenScript and were prepared in
water. BIRD-2 was initially described and referred to
as TAT-IDPDD/AA [16] and has the following sequence:
RKKRRQRRRGGNVYTEIKCNSLLPLAAIVRV.
Two
control peptides, neither of which had any detectable
activity, nor any differences in effects, were used
interchangeably in this study. One is a scrambled form of
27398

BIRD-2 that has been referred to previously [16] with sequ­
ence: RKKRRQRRRGGDLNEVTCSLIVDRINPVKLY.
The other has sequence identical to BIRD-2 except for
point mutations designed to inhibit function: RKK­
RRQRRRGGNVYTEGKCNSGGPLAAIGRV. Peptides were
purified by liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry to more
than 95% purity, and were quantified by amino acid analysis.

incubation, cells were collected, washed twice with icecold PBS, and fixed for 10 minutes at room temperature
in 2% paraformaldehyde in PBS. Cells were then washed
twice with ice-cold PBS and permeabilized for 30 minutes
at room temperature in a solution containing 0.1% Triton
X-100 and 2% BSA in PBS. Following two additional
washes with ice-cold PBS, samples were incubated for 30
minutes at room temperature in blocking buffer containing
2% BSA in PBS and incubated overnight at 4°C with
0.65 μg Bax 6A7 antibody (BD Pharmingen) or 0.65 μg
Normal Mouse IgG antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology)
in PBS containing 2% BSA. After two washes with PBS,
samples were incubated for 1 hour at room temperature in
the dark with AlexaFluor 488 Goat Anti-Mouse secondary
antibody (Invitrogen) at a concentration of 1:175 in PBS
containing 2% BSA. Samples were washed twice in the
dark and images were acquired through a QImaging
camera on a Nikon Eclipse TE2000-S microscope
equipped with a 20× objective using MetaMorph software.

MTS assay
Cell viability was measured using the MTS assay
using the Cell Proliferation Kit (Promega). Adherent cells
were plated at 5,000/well in 96-well cell culture plates
and incubated overnight before use. Non-adherent cells
(leukemia, lymphoma, and myeloma cell lines and primary
CLL cells) were suspended at 2 × 105/ml in culture media.
All cells were treated with synthetic peptides for time
periods indicated in the text, followed by addition of 20 μL
MTS reagent to 100 μL cell culture media and incubation
for four hours before cell lysis by 1% SDS. Absorbance
at 490 nm was measured using a VICTOR3 microplate
reader (Perkin Elmer). The percentage of viable cells was
determined by comparing the absorbance in drug-treated
cells to the absorbance in vehicle-treated cells.

Calcium imaging
Techniques for single-cell digital imaging of Fura2-AM-loaded cells were described previously [16, 53].

CellTiter-Glo assay

Immunoblotting

Cells were added to 96-well plates and treated as
above with the concentrations of drugs indicated in the
text. After 24 hours, CTG assay reagent (Promega) was
diluted 5-fold in PBS, and 80 μL of the diluted reagent
was added to each well. Plates were agitated for 2 min
and then incubated at rest for 10 min. Total luminescence
of each well, corresponding to ATP content, was recorded
using a VICTOR3 microplate reader (Perkin Elmer).

The procedures were described previously [53]. The
following antibodies were used: anti-Bcl-2 (Santa Cruz,
sc-7382); anti-Mcl-1 (Biovision, 3035-100); anti-Bim
(Cell Signaling, 2933); anti-PARP (Cell Signaling, 9542);
anti-cleaved Caspase-3 (Cell Signaling, 9661); and, antibeta-actin (Sigma, A2228).

Hoechst staining to detect apoptotic nuclei

RNA was isolated from cells treated with either
BIRD-2 or BIRD-2ctrl and RT-PCR used to assess the
expression levels for Bcl-2 and Bim using previously
described methods [59].

RT-PCR

MM: Cells were plated at 2 × 106/mL and treated with
vehicle (water), BIRD-2ctrl, or BIRD-2 at the indicated
concentrations for the time periods indicated in the figure
legends. FL: Cells were treated with ABT-199, BIRD2 or ABT-199+BIRD-2 or no treatment at the indicated
concentrations for 20 hours. Cells were incubated with
10 μg/mL of Hoechst 33342 for 10 minutes and images
were taken with a Axiovert S100 (Zeiss) Fluorescence
Microscope equipped with a 40 × oil objective (Zeiss) with
excitation/emission at 350/535 nm. For each treatment,
200–600 cells were analyzed for presence of chromatin
condensation characteristic of apoptosis.

Xenograft model
Animal protocols were approved by the Institutional
Animal Care and Use Committee, Case Western Reserve
University. Tumor xenografts were established by
subcutaneous injection of 9 × 106 NCI-H929 cells into the
flank of 5–7 week old NCR nu/nu mice. Tumor size was
measured by caliper and tumor volume was estimated by
the formula as: Volume (mm3) = 0.5 × (length) × (width)2,
where length and width represents the long and short
diameter of a tumor, respectively. When tumors reached
an average size of 60–80 mm3, peritumoral injection of
saline or BIRD-2 (at the dose of 10 mg/kg) was performed
every 2-3 days for a total of four injections. Mice were
sacrificed 18 days after tumor inoculation and tumors were
excised and weighed.

Immunocytochemistry to detect active Bax
The procedure was described previously [58]
with modifications noted here. Briefly, cells were plated
at 1x106/mL and treated with 10 μM BIRD-2, 10 μM
BIRD-2ctrl, or 2.5 μM staurosporine. After 4 hours of
