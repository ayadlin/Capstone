BACKGROUND: Beyond the usual regimens based on streptozocin and doxorubicin or 5-fluorouracil, no
second-line therapy of metastatic neuroendocrine tumor has gained wide acceptance. Gemcitabine and
oxaliplatin are generally well tolerated and have shown activity against a wide range of malignancies. The
authors assessed the efficacy of gemcitabine-oxaliplatin combination (GEMOX) in the treatment of patients
with metastatic neuroendocrine tumors. METHODS: Twenty consecutive patients with progressive disease
were treated with GEMOX, in most cases after failure of other chemotherapy regimens (median ¼ 2).
Patients were followed for evidence of toxicity, response, and survival. Two patients were chemotherapynaive at treatment initiation and were excluded from the efficacy analysis. RESULTS: Toxicity was manageable overall; however, 6 (30%) patients had to discontinue treatment because of oxaliplatin-induced neurotoxicity (grade 2). Three (17%) of 18 patients had a partial response, median progression-free survival was
7.0 months, and median overall survival was 23.4 months. CONCLUSIONS: Gemcitabine-oxaliplatin combination shows interesting activity and is well tolerated in pretreated patients with neuroendocrine tumors.

Neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) comprise a heterogeneous group of rare malignancies. These
tumors can be classified according to their organ of origin as well as according to their degree of differentiation.1 Well-differentiated endocrine carcinomas are considered low-grade malignancies, but 20% to 50%
of patients present with metastases at the time of diagnosis.2,3 Once metastases are present, patients are

usually not curable, but may live for long periods of time,
up to several years. Several treatment options are available
for patients with metastatic disease, ranging from watchful
waiting to chemotherapy, transcatheter arterial chemoembolization, and liver transplantation for liver metastases.
The precise role and the best sequence for these different
therapies are currently not known for several reasons: rarity and heterogeneity of the disease, lack of randomized
trials, and lack of consensus between experts. The European Neuroendocrine Tumor Society has recently
released guidelines for pathological diagnosis and staging
of endocrine tumors,4,5 which derive from consensus conferences held in 2006 and 2007. These guidelines may
help homogenize the management of these rare tumors in
the future.
Most reports have addressed the efficacy of chemotherapy in the first-line setting, with response rates of
20% to 35%.6 Combinations including streptozocin, 5fluorouracil, or doxorubicin have yielded only modest
response rates, and are associated with significant toxicity.
These combinations are, however, considered to be the
most efficient regimens available for patients with carcinoid and pancreatic islet cell tumors.7-9 Currently few
data exist regarding chemotherapy for metastatic endocrine carcinoma beyond first line. A prospective study
from the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group investigated the activity of single-agent dacarbazine in patients
failing streptozocin-based regimens and reported only
modest activity in this setting.10 Although there is currently no standard therapy after failure of streptozocin
combination chemotherapy, several treatment options are
available aside from chemotherapy: promising results
with peptide receptor radionuclide therapy were recently
reported by Kwekkeboom et al using (177Lu-DOTA0,
Tyr3)octreotate11; several targeted therapies are also currently under active investigation, and preliminary reports
of promising activity have been recently reported for everolimus and sunitinib.12,13 However, chemotherapy regimens with less associated toxicity than streptozocin-based
regimens are needed.
Gemcitabine is a nucleoside analog with structural
similarities to cytarabine, and was widely used in the treatment of patients with advanced pancreatic adenocarcinoma.14 Kulke et al reported its use as a single agent in
18 patients with metastatic NETs. Although treatment

was well tolerated, no radiological responses were
observed, 65% of patients experienced disease stabilization, and the median overall survival was <1 year.15
Oxaliplatin is a platinum analogue with a favorable
safety profile in comparison with other platinum derivatives and has significant activity in various gastrointestinal
cancers.16-19 Tetzlaff et al first reported the response to an
oxaliplatin-based regimen in a patient with metastatic carcinoid tumor in 2005.20 Bajetta et al recently reported the
interesting results of a phase 2 trial of capecitabine and
oxaliplatin combination in patients with advanced
untreated neuroendocrine tumor. The response rate in the
27 patients with low-grade neuroendocrine tumor was
30% (8 of 27).21 Several phase 2 trials are currently
ongoing with oxaliplatin-based regimens in patients with
well-differentiated NETs.21-23
The favorable toxicity profile of gemcitabine-oxaliplatin combination (GEMOX), together with the significant antitumor activity in several gastrointestinal
malignancies,17,19 led us to evaluate its efficacy and tolerability for patients with metastatic NETs who failed 1 or
several previous chemotherapy regimens and/or biotherapy. To our knowledge, the current study is the first to
evaluate GEMOX in this setting.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
This was a retrospective study aiming to assess the efficacy
of GEMOX in patients with advanced NETs. The study
was approved by the review board of the gastroenterologyoncology department.

Study Population
The study population consisted of patients with histologically confirmed, progressive, unresectable, or metastatic
NETs. Previous treatments with chemotherapy, chemoembolization, interferon, or octreotide were allowed.
Between June 2004 and April 2008, 20 consecutive
patients received GEMOX chemotherapy for metastatic
or locally advanced endocrine carcinoma with palliative
intent in 2 centers of a single institution. Patients’ names
were retrieved from an institutional database of patients
with endocrine tumors. Patients’ files were then reviewed
for efficacy outcomes (eg, response rate and progression3393

gression or toxicity, or for patients on chemotherapy ‘‘holiday’’) patients were followed-up every 3 month with
clinical examination and imaging studies.

Treatment Program

Statistical Analysis

The GEMOX regimen comprised gemcitabine 1000 mg/
m2 as a 30-minute intravenous infusion followed by oxaliplatin 100 mg/m2 as a 2-hour intravenous infusion.
Cycles were repeated every 2 weeks. Complete blood
count, serum biochemistry, and liver function tests were
repeated 24 to 48 hours before Day 1 of each treatment
cycle. Chemotherapy was administered if neutrophils
were >1.5 billion/L and platelets >100 billion/L, except
for 1 patient with documented hypersplenism in whom
treatment was administered if platelets were >75 billion/
L. Chemotherapy doses were reduced if needed according
to the following guidelines: for patients experiencing excessive (grade 4 hematological side effects or grade 3
nonhematological side effects) ‘‘general’’ toxicities (eg, asthenia, hematological toxicity, nausea and vomiting),
doses of both drugs were reduced to 75% and to 50% if a
subsequent dose reduction was needed. For oxaliplatinspecific toxicities (paresthesia and neuropathy), only the
doses of oxaliplatin were reduced, first to 75 mg/m2 and
then to 50 mg/m2.

Overall survival was calculated from the date of Cycle 1Day 1 of GEMOX chemotherapy to the date of death.
Progression-free survival (PFS) was calculated from the
date of Cycle 1-Day 1 of GEMOX chemotherapy to the
date of disease progression or death from any cause,
whichever occurred first. Survival distributions were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method.

Response Criteria
All patients were assessed every 4 cycles using clinical examination and computed tomography scan and/or magnetic resonance imaging when appropriate. Radiological
response was classified according to Response Evaluation
Criteria in Solid Tumors criteria.26 Complete response
required disappearance of all target lesions lasting for at
least 4 weeks. Partial response (PR) required a decrease of
>30% in the sum of the largest perpendicular diameters
of all measurable lesions, persisting for at least 4 weeks,
without progression of any nonmeasurable sites and without the appearance of new lesions. Progressive disease
(PD) included an increase of 20% or more in the sum of
the longest diameters of target lesions, taking as references
the smallest longest diameter recorded since the treatment
started, or the appearance of 1 or more new lesions. Stable
disease was defined as having neither sufficient shrinkage
to qualify as a PR, nor sufficient increase to qualify as PD.
After chemotherapy withdrawal (because of either pro3394

RESULTS
Patient Characteristics
The baseline characteristics of the 20 patients are summarized in Table 1. Briefly, median age was 56 years (range,
32-73 years), and most patients had digestive endocrine
carcinomas (the primary site was ileal in 5 cases, pancreatic in 5, and bronchial in 4; the 6 remaining patients had
primary tumors of other origin). Thirteen patients had a
World Health Organization (WHO) performance scale
(PS) of 0 or 1, and 7 patients had a PS of 2. The median
number of previous chemotherapy regimen was 2 (range,
0-4), and all patients but 2 had progressed on at least 1
previous chemotherapy regimen; only 1 patient had previously received a cisplatin-containing regimen (etoposidecisplatin). The median time from original diagnosis to
start of GEMOX chemotherapy was 4.7 years (range, 0.626.9 years), and the median time from diagnosis of metastatic disease was 3.6 years (range, 0.6-21.3 years). All
patients but 1 had their tumor assigned to Group 2 of the
WHO classification for endocrine tumors24 (ie, well-differentiated endocrine carcinoma); 1 patient was diagnosed
as having poorly differentiated endocrine carcinoma, but
nonetheless experienced overall prolonged survival,
including after metastatic relapse (>6 years). Proliferation
index using Ki67 was available for only 4 patients;
3 patients had pancreatic endocrine carcinoma with 5%,
20%, and 60% of cells staining positive for Ki67, and
1 patient with endocrine carcinoma of the ovary had 20%
of cells staining positive. Patients with 20% cells positive for KI67 were still considered as Group 2 (grade 3) of
the WHO classification based on morphology.

Ten (50%) patients had previously received a-interferon. Two patients had relapsed 21 and 42 months after
liver transplantation for liver metastases of NETs (1 pancreatic endocrine carcinoma, 1 bronchial carcinoid,
respectively). All patients had received GEMOX for documented disease progression within the last 3 months: 14
patients had Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid
Tumors-defined progression (ie, >20% increase in size or
appearance of new target lesions), whereas 6 patients had
some kind of radiological progression (median 11%
increase in size; range, 6%-15%) with clinical deterioration or symptom worsening.
The 2 patients who received GEMOX as first-line
therapy were 1 patient with a carcinoid tumor of the ovary
with metastases to the liver, lung, and peritoneum, and 1
patient with a bronchial carcinoid tumor with liver metastases and peritoneal carcinomatosis. They received 4 and 10
cycles of full-dose GEMOX, respectively. The patient with
the carcinoid tumor of the ovary progressed after 4 cycles
but is still alive with >7 months of follow-up. The patient
with the bronchial carcinoid tumor had a PR and went on a
chemotherapy holiday after 10 cycles. Disease progression
was documented 9.4 months after initiation of GEMOX.
These 2 patients were excluded from further analysis.

GEMOX was given at half dose (gemcitabine 500 mg/m2
and oxaliplatin 50 mg/m2) in 5 patients who were considered too fragile to tolerate full-dose combination; 1
patient had received 3 prior chemotherapy regimens and
had grade 1 thrombocytopenia because of hypersplenism,
1 patient had just undergone bilateral adrenalectomy for
ectopic adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) secretion
inducing Cushing syndrome, 1 patient had poor hematological tolerance to chemotherapy after liver transplantation, and the other 2 patients had only received 1 prior
chemotherapy regimen but with poor overall tolerance.
The median number of GEMOX cycles administered was
7 (range, 1-16). Ten patients discontinued GEMOX
because of toxicity, in 6 cases because of oxaliplatininduced grade 2 neuropathy, whereas 5 patients discontinued because of disease progression (Table 2); the 3
remaining patients are still receiving GEMOX (n ¼ 1),
are still on chemotherapy holiday (n ¼ 1), or were lost to
follow-up (n ¼ 1).

and follow-up values during GEMOX chemotherapy
were available for 3 of them: in 1 patient with a radiological PR, chromogranin A decreased by 17%; in 2 patients
with radiologically stable disease, chromogranin A rose by
64% and 67%, respectively. One patient with ectopic
ACTH production from an advanced gastrinoma had a
10% decrease in ACTH during GEMOX chemotherapy.

DISCUSSION
Overall, 122 cycles of GEMOX were administered
to 18 patients; 77 cycles were administered at full dose, 2
at 75% dose, and 43 at 50% dose (because of the finding
that 5 patients started treatment at 50% dose). Thirteen
(11%) cycles were delayed in 6 patients; 6 cycles were
delayed because of thrombocytopenia (3 patients), 4 cycles
because of asthenia (2 patients), 2 because of poor digestive tolerance (2 patients), and 1 because of infection.
Two patients required dose reductions because of recurrent thrombocytopenia. No clinically significant thrombocytopenia occurred (eg, bleeding because of grade 3 or
4 thrombocytopenia). Two patients received primary prophylaxis with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, and
no patient required rehospitalization for febrile neutropenia. Two patients required erythrocyte transfusion for
grade 3 anemia.

Response Rate, PFS, and Overall Survival
Partial response was observed in 3 of 18 patients (17%;
95% confidence interval, 3.6-41.4), 12 (67%) patients
had stable disease for a median of 5.5 months (range, 3.420.3 months), and 3 (17%) patients had disease progression at first assessment. Median PFS and overall survivals
were 7.0 months and 23.4 months, respectively (Figs. 1,
2, respectively). Four patients had disease stabilization for
12 months, 1 of which is still receiving intermittent
cycles of GEMOX chemotherapy >20 months after the
first cycle.
Patients with a PR included 1 patient with thymic
carcinoid (time to progression, 14.6 months) and
2 patients with pancreatic endocrine carcinomas (time to
progression, 12 and 7 months, respectively).
Baseline chromogranin A (within 1 month of Cycle
1-Day 1 of GEMOX) was available for 6 of 18 patients,

We report here our experience with GEMOX chemotherapy for the treatment of patients with well-differentiated
advanced progressive NETs. In our hands, this combination was feasible, with acceptable toxicity in the setting of
heavily pretreated patients, albeit doses were adapted for
5 patients. Six patients discontinued chemotherapy
because of oxaliplatin-related neurotoxicity, no grade 4
toxicity was observed, and no treatment-related death was
recorded. The overall response rate was 17%, 67% of
patients had stable disease, and the median PFS was
7 months.
In the setting of first-line therapy for advanced disease, streptozocin-containing regimens produce objective
response in 30% to 35% of patients with islet-cell carcinoma, with PFS of 18-24 months. However, PFS is usually shorter when patients receive these combinations as
second-line therapy.27,28 In patients with well-differentiated gastrointestinal endocrine carcinomas, streptozocinbased combinations (usually with 5-fluorouracil) show
response rates of 10% to 20% with PFS of 5 to
7 months.8,10 Other combinations such as 5-fluorouracilepirubicin-dacarbazine seem to have similar activity.29
Finally, patients with metastatic pulmonary carcinoids are
usually treated with platinum-based chemotherapy, but
results are disappointing overall.30,31
After failure with these ‘‘standard’’ first-line regimens, no single chemotherapy regimen has emerged as a
standard for second-line therapy. In a randomized phase
2/3 study from the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group,
67 patients with carcinoid tumors received dacarbazine in
a crossover arm after failure of streptozotocin and doxorubicin or streptozotocin and fluorouracil combination. In
this study, 5 of 61 (8.2%) evaluable patients had a
response and 7 (11.3%) had stable disease; the PFS was
not reported, but the overall survival was 11.9 months.10
In another arm of this study, 21 patients received singleCancer

agent dacarbazine either because they had previously
received doxorubicin, fluorouracil, or streptozocin, or
because they had renal or heart disease counterindicating
streptozotocin and doxorubicin or streptozotocin and fluorouracil combination. In this latter arm, the response
rate (PRs) was 9.5% (2 of 21), and the median PFS and
overall survival were 4.1 and 8.8 months, respectively.10
In contrast, our results show that gemcitabine-oxaliplatin
combination has significant activity in this setting, with a
17% response rate and a 7.0-month median PFS in
patients with neuroendocrine tumors previously treated
with chemotherapy (in most cases 2 or more previous regimens). Overall toxicity was mild; however, half of the
patients discontinued treatment because of toxicity, in
most cases because of oxaliplatin-related neurotoxicity.
Newer agents, such as paclitaxel, docetaxel, topotecan, and gemcitabine, have shown little activity as single
agents.15,32-34 More recently, temozolomide has been
shown to have interesting single-agent activity with a
favorable toxicity profile in previously treated patients.35
Several phase 2 trials have shown promising results with
temozolomide-based combinations using antiangiogenic
drugs such as bevacizumab or thalidomide,36,37 and cape-

citabine-temozolomide was reported to produce responses
in 59% to 71% of patients with advanced pancreatic endocrine tumor.38,39
Current research focuses on the incorporation of
antiangiogenic drugs and/or drugs targeting the mTOR
pathway in the treatment of NETs either alone or in
combination with conventional chemotherapy or interferon. Several phase 2 trials have been reported with
agents such as temsirolimus,40 thalidomide,36 sorafenib,41 everolimus,12 sunitinib,13 and bevacizumab,22,23,42 and phase 3 trials are currently ongoing
with everolimus, sunitinib, and bevacizumab. Some
published results are promising, but others are either
disappointing from the efficacy standpoint (temsirolimus)40 or raise concern regarding the safety of such
agents in this setting (sorafenib).41
Preliminary results of 2 phase 2 trials of bevacizumab and oxaliplatin-based combinations seem to support
the activity of oxaliplatin in the treatment of advanced
NETs.22,23 These combinations also include bevacizumab, which was previously shown to have activity in
NETs37,42; however, the reported response rate suggests
increased activity with oxaliplatin-base chemotherapy. In

a phase 2 trial, Bajetta et al reported a 27.5% response rate
in 40 patients with neuroendocrine tumors treated with
oxaliplatin and capecitabine.21 In this study, 27 patients
had well-differentiated endocrine carcinomas; in this subgroup, the response rate was 30%, 48% of patients had
stable disease as their best response, the median time to
progression was 20 months, and median overall survival
was 40 months. Toxicity was mild overall, and only
12.5% of patients experienced oxaliplatin-related paresthesia, which is likely because of the predetermined number of cycles of chemotherapy in this study.21
Although no definitive conclusions can be drawn
from our series of patients because of the heterogeneity of
the underlying disease, GEMOX combination seems active,
given the heavily pretreated population. Interestingly,
whereas gemcitabine as a single agent was shown to have little activity in this disease,15 the combination with oxaliplatin yielded an interesting response rate (17%), with a PFS of
7.0 months, which compares favorably with other agents in
this setting, including targeted agents.41,43,44
Overall, our experience with GEMOX chemotherapy shows that this combination is feasible and has promising activity in patients with previously treated NETs.
