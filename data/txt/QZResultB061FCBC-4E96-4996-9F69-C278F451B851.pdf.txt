resistance4. Phosphorylation of Akt at S473 (ref. 5) and T308 (ref. 6) activates Akt. However, it
remains unclear whether further mechanisms account for full Akt activation, and whether Akt
hyperactivation is linked to misregulated cell cycle progression, another cancer hallmark7. Here
we report that Akt activity fluctuates across the cell cycle, mirroring cyclin A expression.
Mechanistically, phosphorylation of S477 and T479 at the Akt extreme carboxy terminus by
cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (Cdk2)/cyclin A or mTORC2, under distinct physiological conditions,
promotes Akt activation through facilitating, or functionally compensating for, S473
phosphorylation. Furthermore, deletion of the cyclin A2 allele in the mouse olfactory bulb leads to
reduced S477/T479 phosphorylation and elevated cellular apoptosis. Notably, cyclin A2-deletioninduced cellular apoptosis in mouse embryonic stem cells is partly rescued by S477D/T479EAkt1, supporting a physiological role for cyclin A2 in governing Akt activation. Together, the
results of our study show Akt S477/T479 phosphorylation to be an essential layer of the Akt
activation mechanism to regulate its physiological functions, thereby providing a new mechanistic
link between aberrant cell cycle progression and Akt hyperactivation in cancer.

Using single live-cell imaging8, we found that Akt activation fluctuated across the cell cycle,
inversely correlating with Cdt1 abundance9 (Fig. 1a and Supplementary Fig. 1a). Statistical
analysis of immunostained HeLa cells further showed that Akt-pS473 has a similar periodic
feature as geminin9,10 (Fig. 1b). Notably, in several cancer cell lines (Fig. 1c, d and
Supplementary Fig. 1b, c), Akt phosphorylation, but not total Akt abundance, fluctuated
across the cell cycle. The periodic Akt phosphorylation mirrored the expression pattern of
cyclin A2, the predominant mammalian cyclin A isoform11, during cell cycle progression
(Fig. 1c, d). Moreover, acute depletion of cyclin A2 or Cdk2, but not cyclin E, resulted in
decreased Akt phosphorylation, with no significant impact on phosphorylation of Akt
upstream kinases PDK1 and mTORC2 (Fig. 1d). This prompted us to evaluate whether
Cdk2/cyclin A directly regulates Akt activation in a phosphorylation-dependent manner
during the cell cycle12.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

In support of Akt as a Cdk2/cyclin A substrate, Akt isoforms interacted with cyclin A2 (Fig.
2a and Supplementary Fig. 2a). Furthermore, we identified four ‘RXL’ cyclin A-binding
motifs13 in Akt1 (Fig.2b), all of which are evolutionarily conserved (Supplementary Fig.
2b). Mutation of R76CL or R273DL, and to a lesser extent, R200VL or R370TL (RXL to
AXA) attenuated Akt1 interaction with cyclin A2 (Fig. 2c), and reduced Akt1 activity
(Supplementary Fig. 2c). Consistently, depleting cyclin A2 or Cdk2 (Supplementary Fig.
2d–f) led to a significant reduction in Akt phosphorylation. More importantly, either acute
treatment with Cdk2 inhibitors (Fig. 2d) or deletion of the cyclin A2 allele in cyclin A2f/f
primary mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) (Fig. 2e) led to a marked decrease in Akt
phosphorylation without a significant perturbation of cell cycle progression (Fig. 2d and ref.
14), excluding a possible indirect cell cycle effect on Akt phosphorylation by inhibiting
Cdk2/cyclin A.
Notably, deletion of cyclin A2, but not cyclin A1 or cyclin E1/E2 alleles, caused a
significant decrease of Akt phosphorylation (Fig. 2f, g), whereas conversely, ectopic
expression of cyclin A2 (Fig. 2h and Supplementary Fig. 3a) resulted in elevated Akt
phosphorylation coupled with enhanced in vitro anchorage-independent growth

(Supplementary Fig. 3b, c). Moreover, depletion of Cdh1, the E3 ligase that controls cyclin
A turnover15, resulted in increased cyclin A2 abundance and elevated Akt phosphorylation,
leading to enhanced in vitro anchorage-independent growth (Supplementary Fig. 3d, e) and
in vivo tumour formation (Fig. 2i and Supplementary Fig. 3f–h). More importantly,
increased Akt phosphorylation and tumor-igenicity by depleting Cdh1 could be partly
reversed by extra depletion of cyclin A2 (Fig. 2j and Supplementary Fig. 3i–l). Collectively,
these results support Cdk2/cyclin A2 as a major physiological kinase that governs Akt
phosphorylation and oncogenic functions.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Notably, Cdk2/cyclin A directly phosphorylated Akt1 in vitro on its carboxy (C)-terminal
region (Supplementary Fig. 4a, b). Serial truncations showed Cdk2/cyclin A
phosphorylation sites in the last four evolutionarily conserved residues and subsequent
mutageneses pinpointed both S477 and T479 as Cdk2/cyclin A sites (Supplementary Fig.
4c–e). Similarly, Cdk2/cyclin A phosphorylated Akt2-S478 (Supplementary Fig. 4f).
Interestingly, mutation of G478 to proline (G478P) to mimic the canonical Cdk2 ‘SP/TP’
phospho-motif16,17, or to other bulky amino acids (L/W/R), did not significantly affect
Cdk2/cyclin-A-mediated Akt phosphorylation (Supplementary Fig. 4g). Conversely, Cterminal addition of an α-helix18 (Supplementary Fig. 4g) or a green fluorescent protein
(GFP) (Supplementary Fig. 4h) reduced Cdk2/cyclin-A-mediated phosphorylation of the
engineered non-tail version of S477G478-, but not S477P478-Akt1. These data indicate that
S477/T479 may belong to a new class of Cdk2/cyclin A phospho-motifs where relative
structural flexibility at the Akt1 C terminus might override the requirement of an adjacent
proline for Cdk2-mediated phosphorylation of canonical TP/SP sites16,17 typically buried
within defined structures.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Furthermore, mass spectrometry analyses confirmed Akt1 S477 and T479 phosphorylation19
(Supplementary Fig. 5a–d). To gain further mechanistic insights, we developed phosphospecific antibodies that recognize pS477/pT479-Akt1 (Supplementary Fig. 6a–f), pS477Akt1 or pT479-Akt1 (Supplementary Fig. 7a–h) in vivo. Owing to the large consistency
among three antibodies under our experimental conditions, we focused on examining the
correlation of Akt1-pS477/pT479 and Akt activation in the remainder of the studies. As with
pS473-Akt1, Akt1 tail phosphorylation fluctuated during the cell cycle (Fig. 1c, d and
Supplementary Fig. 1b, c), and was subjected to regulation by Cdk2/cyclin A (Fig. 2d–h).
Furthermore, a positive correlation between cyclin A2 expression and Akt1-pS477/pT479
was observed in breast cancer patient samples (Fig. 2k and Supplementary Fig. 8a, b). More
importantly, similar to the reported phosphorylation of Akt-S473 by several upstream
kinases dependent on upstream stimuli5,20,21, Akt1-pS477/pT479 could be mediated by
mTOR (Supplementary Figs 9a–c, 10a–g and 11a–c) or DNAPK (Supplementary Fig. 9d, e),
in addition to Cdk2/cyclin A. In keeping with this notion, elevated Akt1-pS477/pT479 was
detected in Pten heterozygous MEFs (Supplementary Fig. 10h). Interestingly, Akt1-pS477/
pT479 was negatively regulated by PTEN in mice in a tissue-specific manner and largely
with Akt-pS473 (Supplementary Fig. 10i).
Moreover, inactivation of mTORC2 by depleting Rictor led to a more dramatic reduction of
Akt1-pS477/pT479 in response to insulin (Supplementary Fig. 11a) than under synchronized
cell cycle conditions (Supplementary Fig. 12a). Conversely, depletion of Cdk2, but not

Rictor (Supplementary Fig. 12a, b), resulted in a more robust reduction in Akt1-pS477/
pT479 across the cell cycle. These findings suggest that Akt1-pS477/pT479 is possibly
mediated by Cdk2/cyclin A, mTORC2 or DNAPK, under cell cycle progression, growth
factor stimulation or DNA damaging conditions, respectively (Supplementary Fig. 13a, b).
Notably, depletion of Cdk2, cyclin A2 or Rictor in human primary foreskin fibroblasts all
resulted in reduced Akt1-pS477/pT479 (Supplementary Fig. 14a–c), highlighting both Cdk2/
cyclin A and mTORC2 as upstream physiological kinases governing Akt1-pS477/pT479.
We therefore next evaluated the contribution of Akt1-pS477/pT479 to Akt kinase activation
under various cellular conditions.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

In keeping with the notion that Akt1 tail phosphorylation is required to achieve full Akt1
activation, the phospho-deficient Akt1-S477A/T479A (Akt1-AA) mutant showed a dramatic
suppression, whereas a phosphomimetic S477D/T479E (Akt1-DE) mutant showed enhanced
Akt1 phosphorylation and activation (Fig. 3a–c and Supplementary Fig. 15a–c). However,
caution needs to be taken in interpreting these results, as these mutations might not fully
recapitulate the in vivo phosphorylation status. Strikingly, Akt1-AA was defective in pS473
even in the myristoylation-tagged constitutively active Akt1 (Fig. 3d), advocating a critical
role for Akt1-pS477/pT479 in activating Akt (Supplementary Fig. 16a–c). Consistently,
S477D/T479E effectively rescued Akt-pS473 and kinase activity of the cyclin A binding
motif-defective mutant, R76A (Fig. 3e, f), as well as its anchorage-independent growth
ability (Supplementary Fig. 16d). However, the rescue effect of DE on Akt1-R76A was not
due to changes in its affinity with PIP3 (Supplementary Fig. 16e).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Consistent with S477/T479 being Cdk2/cyclin A sites, ectopic expression of Akt1-DE partly
rescued cell cycle defects observed in quadruple knockout MEFs (cyclin E1−/−/cyclin E2−/−/
cyclin A1−/−/cyclin A2f/f) after Cre infection (Fig. 3g and Supplementary Fig. 16f).
Compared with the periodic phosphorylation of wild-type Akt1 (Akt1-WT), Akt1-AA was
severely impaired, whereas Akt1-DE showed an elevated and constitutive S473/T308
phosphorylation across the cell cycle (Fig. 3h). More importantly, under several
physiological conditions (Supplementary Fig. 17a–c), Akt-pS473/pT308 was severely
compromised in Akt1-AA, but robustly elevated in Akt1-DE expressing cells. Consistently,
depletion of cyclin A2 in Akt1-WT, but not Akt1-DE expressing cells, led to a significant
reduction in Akt phosphorylation (Supplementary Fig. 17d) and decreased tumour formation
in vivo (Fig. 3i and Supplementary Fig. 17e–g). Cumulatively, these data demonstrate that in
response to several upstream signals, phosphorylation of Akt1-S477/T479 may govern the
canonical Akt-pS473 to promote Akt activation. Thus, we next evaluated the precise
molecular mechanism(s) linking Akt1-pS477/pT479 to pS473 and subsequent Akt
activation.
As Akt2 crystal structures are reported in great detail22,23, we next focused on understanding
how Akt2-pS478 (equivalent to Akt1-pS477; Supplementary Figs 4d and 18a) modulates
Akt2 kinase activity. Notably, Akt2-pS478 functioned synergistically with Akt2-pS474
(equivalent to Akt1-pS473) to allosterically activate Akt2 (Fig. 4a and Supplementary Fig.
18b). Mechanistically, Akt2-pS478 may create a new charge–charge interaction between
S478D and R208 to stabilize Akt2 in its closed, active form (Supplementary Fig. 18c, d).
Consistently, deletion of the Akt1-tail after amino acid 475 (termed 476Δ) led to

significantly increased Akt phosphorylation (Supplementary Fig. 18e), suggesting that either
phosphorylation or deletion of the tail region could lock Akt in its active conformation.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Intriguingly, in addition to stabilizing Akt, Akt tail phosphorylation may alter Akt kinase
kinetics to accelerate the kinase reaction (Supplementary Fig. 18f). Furthermore, pS473 and
pS477/pT479, both of which activate Akt, are intrinsically linked; as compared with Akt1WT, Akt1-DE but not Akt1-AA was preferentially phosphorylated by mTOR in vitro
(Supplementary Fig. 19a, b). This indicates that pS477/pT479 might prime Akt1 for
mTORC2-mediated phosphorylation of S473 (refs 5, 24) (Fig. 4b). Mechanistically,
enhanced phosphorylation of Akt1-DE at S473 by mTOR may be in part due to its increased
interaction with Sin1 (Fig. 4c) and mTOR, but not due to changes in its association with the
Akt inhibitor CTMP25 or phosphatase PHLPP2 (ref. 26) (Supplementary Fig. 19c, d).
However, phospho-mimetic mutation of S473 (S473D) (Supplementary Fig. 20a) or its
mimicking peptide library (Supplementary Fig. 20b) led to reduced Akt1 tail
phosphorylation, suggesting that the pS477/pT479 event may precede pS473.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Mutation of either S473 or S477/T479 to alanine significantly reduced Akt activity towards
phosphorylating Skp2 or crosstides, whereas no significant additive effect was observed in
S473A/S477A/T479A (Supplementary Fig. 21a, b), arguing for a possible functional
redundancy between pS477/pT479 and pS473 for Akt catalytic activity. Consistently, Akt1DE kinase activity was largely unchanged after depletion of Rictor (Supplementary Fig. 21c,
d), whereas Akt1-DE partly rescued the deficient Akt kinase activity in Akt1-S473A
(Supplementary Fig. 21e, f). Given the close proximity of S473 and S477/T479, these results
indicate that in addition to promoting pS473, pS477/pT479 may also trigger Akt activation
independently of, or partly compensate for, pS473.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Biologically, phosphorylation of the Akt1 tail activated Akt1, leading to elevated Skp2 or
FOXO phosphorylation, which further promoted cell cycle progression (Supplementary Fig.
22a–c), or conferred resistance to the chemotherapeutic agents etoposide or camptothecin
(Supplementary Fig. 22d, e), respectively. More importantly, compared with Akt1-WT,
Akt1-DE-expressing cells showed growth advantage in both in vitro soft agar (Fig. 4d, e)
and in vivo tumour formation (Fig. 4f, g and Supplementary Fig. 23a, b) assays, supporting a
role for Akt1-pS477/pT479 in promoting Akt1 activation and signalling phenotypes
associated with malignancy. Notably, Akt1-476Δ phenocopied Akt1-DE by showing
elevated Akt phosphorylation (Supplementary Fig. 18e), probably through enhanced
interaction with mTORC2 (Supplementary Fig. 24a), thereby promoting in vitro anchorageindependent growth and in vivo tumorigenesis (Supplementary Fig. 24 b–f).
To study the in vivo physiological significance of Cdk2/cyclin-A-mediated phosphorylation
on Akt1-S477/T479 further, we generated brain-specific cyclin A2 knockout mice with
nestin-Cre27. Interestingly, a significant reduction in Akt1-pS477/pT479 was observed in
cyclin A2Δ/Δ olfactory bulbs coupled with elevated cleavage of caspase 3 (Fig. 4h),
suggesting that Akt1-pS477/pT479 might be critical for cell survival in olfactory bulbs.
Consistently, acute ablation of cyclin A2 in cyclin A2f/f mouse embryonic stem cells led to
induced cellular apoptosis (Fig. 4i and Supplementary Fig. 25a, d), providing a possible
explanation for previous findings that deleting cyclin A2 abolished embryonic stem cell

colony formation in vitro14. Furthermore, cyclin A2-deletion-induced elevation of cellular
apoptosis in mouse embryonic stem cells could be partly rescued by expressing Akt1-DE,
but not Akt1-AA (Fig. 4i, j and Supplementary Fig. 25), supporting the idea that cyclin A2
may govern cellular survival in vivo largely by promoting Akt activation.
To extend these findings and their clinical relevance to human pathophysiology, we
observed a positive correlation between Akt1-pS477/pT479 and Akt1-pS473 in samples
from patients with breast cancer and breast-cancer-derived cell lines (Supplementary Fig.
26a–e). Interestingly, high levels of pS477/pT479 occurred at a relatively higher rate than
pS473 in an earlier breast cancer developmental stage (stage II) (Supplementary Fig. 26d),
indicating that pS477/pT479 may serve as a better biomarker for early-stage breast cancer
detection, although further investigations are warranted.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Taken together, our data unravel a new phosphorylation event on Akt1 at its extreme Cterminal residues, S477 and T479, to trigger Akt1 activation either through enhancing the
association between Akt1 and mTORC2 to promote pS473, or by functionally compensating
for pS473 to lock Akt1 in its active conformation. More importantly, our study directly
couples Akt activity with cell cycle progression, two well-characterized hallmarks of human
cancers28–30. In this regard, our data suggest that cyclin A2 overexpression might exert its
physiological functions in part by directly phosphorylating and activating Akt to trigger its
pro-survival and oncogenic functions.

E1383), camptothecin (Sigma C156) and doxorubicin (Sigma, D1515) for 48 h. Assays were
performed with a CellTiter-Glo Luminescent Cell Viability Assay Kit according to the
manufacturer’s instructions (Promega).
Single-cell imaging

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Single live-cell imaging procedures were done according to previously described methods36
with some modifications as described below. Cells were plated on number 1.5 coverslips
MatTek Dish (P35G-1.5-14-C). DMEM media (GIBCO) containing 25 mM HEPES, 25 mM
glucose (except for the experiment of manipulating glucose concentration), 2 mM glutamine
and 3% FBS (phenol red was excluded during image acquisition). Cells were imaged on a
Nikon TE 2000E and a Nikon and Ti motorized inverted microscope with a 20×/0.75 or
60×/1.4 (oil immersion) numerical aperture objective lens. Dual emission ratio imaging was
performed with a 436/10 filter, a diachronic mirror (Chroma 86002v1bs) and two emission
filters (470/30 for cyan and 535/30 for yellow). All optical filters were obtained from
Chroma Technologies. Images were acquired with a Hamamatsu ORCA-R2 cooled chargecoupled device (CCD) camera controlled with MetaMorph 7 software (Molecular Devices)
and the Perfect Focus System for continuous maintenance of focus. Fluorescence images
were background-corrected. For time-lapse experiments, images were collected every 30
min for 24 consecutive hours, with an exposure time of 50–100 ms and 2 × 2 binning, with
illumination light shuttered between acquisitions. The ratios of yellow-to-cyan were then
calculated at different time points and normalized by dividing all ratios by the emission ratio
before stimulation, setting the basal emission ratio as 1.

Mapping the cell-cycle progression status in individual cells

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

The procedures for performing this experiment were as described previously37. Briefly, to
relate the elapsed time after cell division to cell-cycle phase and progression with the
abundance or activities of the proteins of interest, we measured the distribution of DNA
content in an asynchronously growing culture by flow cytometry using propidium iodide
staining, as well as the gemenin abundance by a GFP–gemenin reporter as described
previously9. HeLa cells expressing the mAG-hGem fucci reporter system9 were cultured in
DMEM (Cellgro; DMEM 10-017-CV) with 10% FBS (Gibco; 26140) and 1% penicillin/
streptomycin solution (Cellgro; 30-002-CI). Media were further supplemented with 3 μg
ml−1 blasticidin (InvivoGen; ant-bl-5b) to maintain selection of cells expressing mAGhGem. For experiments, cells were plated on 24 mm × 60mm coverslips, no. 1.5 (VWR;
48393-252). Before plating, coverslips were sterilized by incubation for 20 min in 70%
ethanol at room temperature and then dried in sterile conditions. Cells were typically plated
at 1 × 105 cells per millilitre in to 15 cm dishes that were pre-prepared with sterile coverslips
as described above. Cells were fixed approximately 48 h after plating. The kinase activities
of Akt were measured by anti-p-S473-Akt antibody. These distributions were fitted using a
modification of the Dean–Jett model38 to determine the number of cells in G1, S and G2
phases and were subsequently translated to the time spent in various cell-cycle phases using
a previously published model39.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Fixing and staining cells for immunofluorescence
To fix cells, coverslips were incubated for 10 min in 4% paraformaldehyde (Alfa Aesar,
30525-89-4) at room temperature. Cells were then permeabilized for 5 min in dry methanol
at −20 °C and rehydrated in PBS. Cells were incubated with primary antibody (either Antiphospho-Akt (S473) (Cell Signaling; 4060S) or Anti-Akt (Cell Signaling, 4060S)) overnight
at 4 °C, followed by incubation with a fluorescent secondary antibody (Invitrogen, A-21429)
for 1 h at room temperature. Antibody solutions were made in PBS with 2% bovine serum
albumin (BSA). DNA was stained by incubating in 10 μM 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole
(DAPI) for 5 min. To label protein mass, fixed, permeabilized samples were incubated with
0.04 μg ml−1 succinimidyl ester linked dye diluted in PBS (Alexa Fluor 647 carboxylic acid,
succinimidyl ester; Invitrogen, A-20106). Following labelling procedures, cells were
mounted on glass slides in ProLong Gold antifade (Life Technologies, P36930).

Microscopy
Slides prepared as described above were imaged with a Nikon Ti inverted fluorescence
microscope with Perfect Focus controlled by Nikon Elements. We used the scan-slide
function to image the full area of the slide at ×20 magnification. The microscope was
surrounded by a custom enclosure to maintain constant temperature and atmosphere. The
filter sets used were as follows: cyan fluorescent protein (CFP), 436/20 nm, 455 nm, 480/40
nm (excitation, beam splitter, emission filter); yellow fluorescent protein (YFP), 500/20 nm,
515 nm, 535/30 nm; and mCherry, 560/40 nm, 585 nm, 630/75 nm (Chroma). Images were
acquired every 20 min in the phase and CFP channels and every 60 min in the YFP and
mCherry channels. We acquired six z-sections with a step size of 0.75 μm in the YFP and
mCherry channels. Image acquisition was controlled by MetaMorph software (Molecular

Devices). This resulted in approximately 5,000–8,000 images per slide, leading to a total of
about 100,000 cells. For larger cell counts, data from several slides was concatenated.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Image analysis
Image analysis used Matlab, with an algorithm written by R. Kafri, as described
previously37. Top-Hat transformation of images was used to remove background trends.
Nuclei were identified by thresholding the DAPI image. Boundaries between adjacent,
touching nuclei were identified by seed-based watershedding. Seeds were calculated as the
regional maxima of the Gaussian smoothed image. Cell boundaries were then found by
performing the same steps on the Alexa Fluor 647 scanning electron image using the nuclei
as seeds. The integrated immunofluorescence intensity within the cell boundary was taken as
the Akt or pS473-Akt amount.
Cdk2/cyclin A in vitro kinase assays

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Cdk2/cyclin A in vitro kinase assay methods were adapted from those described
previously5,31. Briefly, 3 μg indicated GST–Akt1-Tail (268–480) fusion proteins were
incubated with 50 ng commercially obtained recombinant active Cdk2/cyclin A proteins
(NEB P6025), in the presence of 5 μCi [γ-32P]ATP and 200 μM cold ATP in the NEB kinase
reaction buffer for 30 min. The reaction was stopped by the addition of SDS containing lysis
buffer and resolved by SDS–PAGE. Phosphorylation of GST–Akt1-Tail was detected by
autoradiography.
For the cold Cdk2/cyclin A in vitro kinase assay, no [γ-32P]ATP was added, and the other
procedures remained the same. For the in vitro kinase assay on full length Akt1, HA-Akt1
was immunoprecipitated from 293T cells and subjected to phosphatase treatment for 30 min
at 30 °C before adding into the kinase reaction.
Akt in vitro kinase assays

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Various HA-Akt1 mutant proteins were HA-immunoprecipitated and stored in EBC buffer
with 10% glycerol. Amounts of kinases affinity purified were determined by Coomassie
staining. About 2 μg of each kinase was incubated with 50 μM crosstide (Millipore 12-331,
based on the Akt phosphorylation site of GSK3), 200 μM ATP (with [γ-32P]ATP) and
reaction buffer (50 mM Tris pH 7.5, 1 mM MnCl2, 2 mM DTT, 1 mM EGTA, 1 mg ml−1
BSA) at 30 °C for 1 h. Aliquots of each reaction were spotted onto P81 phosphocellulose
filters and washed extensively with 75 mM phosphoric acid. Filters were dried and
radioactivity was determined by scintillation counting. Experiments were done in triplicate.
To test the ability of peptides based on the hydrophobic motif of Akt2 to activate the
enzyme, the activity of pΔPH-Akt2-ΔC (Akt2 lacking the PH domain and C-terminal tail
(residues 146–460) but phosphorylated on T309 by GST–PDK1, as described in ref. 23) was
determined in the presence of various hydrophobic-motif peptides. pΔPH-Akt2-ΔC (50 nM)
was combined with 50 mM substrate peptide (crosstide, based on the Akt phosphorylation
site of GSK3), 500 μM ATP (with [γ-32P]ATP), hydrophobic-motif peptides and buffer (50
mM Tris pH 7.5, 10 mM MgCl2, 2 mM DTT, 1 mM EGTA, 1 mg ml−1 BSA) at 30 °C for 1
h. Aliquots of each reaction were spotted onto P81 phosphocellulose filters and washed

mTOR in vitro kinase assay on peptide libraries
The reaction contained 100 ng mTOR (EMD/Calbiochem 475987, containing truncated
mTOR kinase domain with amino acids 1,360–2,549), 50 mM biotinylated peptide mix and
100 μM cold ATP (with 0.8 μCi/ml−1 [γ-32P]ATP) in assay buffer (50 mM HEPES pH 7.5,
10 mM MnCl2, 10 mM MgCl2, 2 mM DTT, 0.5 mM EGTA). In each biotinylated peptide
mix, one amino acid is fixed at the indicated position relative to a central serine/threonine
residue. The remaining positions surrounding the central serine/threonine are degenerate
(approximately equimolar mixtures of the 17 amino acids excluding cysteine, serine and
threonine). The reactions were at 30 °C for approximately 7 h. Aliquots of each reaction
were then spotted onto an avidin-coated membrane. The membrane was washed sequentially
with 0.1% SDS in TBS, 1% H3PO4 and 2 M NaCl. After washing, the membrane was dried
and exposed to a phospho-imager. The extent of incorporation of radiolabelled phosphate
into each peptide was quantified using ImageQuant software.

Mass spectrometry analysis to detect HA-Akt-S477/T479 phosphorylation in vivo

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

The procedures of mass spectrometry analysis were performed as described previously40,41
with minor modifications. Briefly, 293 cells were transiently transfected with the pcDNA3HA-Akt1 plasmid and, 24 h after transfection, cells were treated with insulin for 30 min
before collection. Whole-cell lysates were collected to perform HA immunoprecipitation.
The HA immunoprecipitates were then resolved on SDS–PAGE and visualized by colloidal
Coomassie blue. The band containing HA-Akt1 was excised and washed with 50% acetone.
In-gel digestion of the protein was performed with trypsin and analysed by reversed-phase
microcapillary/tandem mass spectrometry using a LTQ Orbitrap XL (Thermo Fisher
Scientific) Hybrid Ion Trap-Orbitrap Mass Spectrometer. Tandem mass spectrometry
centroid spectra collected by collision-induced dissociation in Top 6 data-dependent
acquisition mode were searched against the concatenated target and decoy(reversed) SwissProt protein database (version 2012_01) using the Sequest search engine with Proteomics
Browser Software (W.S. Lane) with differential modifications for Ser/Thr/Tyr
phosphorylation (+79.97) and differential modification of Met oxidation (+15.99, Msx).
Phosphorylated and unphosphorylated peptide sequences were identified, and manual
inspection and determination of the exact sites of phosphorylation were confirmed using
FuzzyIons and GraphMod software (Proteomics Browser Software, W.S. Lane). False
discovery rates of peptide hits (phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated) were estimated
below 1.0% based on reversed database hits.
Mass spectrometry analysis to detect GST–Akt-S477/T479 phosphorylation in vitro
The mass spectrometry procedure was performed as described previously40,41.
Phosphorylated GST–Akt1 samples were prepared as described in the kinase assay section,
with Cdk2/cyclin A or mTOR, respectively. Specifically, 1 μg of phosphorylated HA-Akt1
proteins were subjected to trypsin digestion before being analysed by mass spectrometry.

5-Bromodeoxyuridine labelling

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

5-Bromodeoxyuridine labelling assay was performed as described previously32.
Experiments were repeated three times to generate the error bars.
Soft agar assay
The anchorage-independent cell growth assays were performed as described previously42.
The solid medium consists of two layers. The bottom layer contains 0.8% noble agar and the
top layer 0.4% agar. Briefly, 3 × 105 cells were plated in the top layer. Complete DMEM
medium (500 μl) was added every other day to keep the top layer moisture, and 3 weeks
later the cells were stained with iodonitrotetrazolium chloride for colony visualization and
counting. Three independent experiments were performed to generate the error bars.
Mouse xenograft assay

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

The tumorigenesis assay was as described previously43. Each xenograft experiment was
performed as described in the corresponding figure legends. For example, in Fig. 4f, g,
briefly 2.5 × 106 HeLa cells stably expressing HA-Akt1-WT, HA-Akt1-S477A/T479A or
HA-Akt1-S477D/T479E (using empty vector as a negative control) were mixed with sterile
1× PBS (1:1) and injected into the flank of 10 male nude mice. Tumour size was measured
weekly with a calliper, and the tumour volume was determined with the formula L × W2 ×
0.52, where L is the longest diameter and W is the shortest diameter. After 28 days, mice
were killed and in vivo solid tumours were dissected, then tumour weights were measured
and recorded.
Immunohistochemistry of tissue microarray (immunohistochemistry and immunostaining
analyses)
Formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded tissue microarrays of human breast tissues and breast
cancer tissues were purchased from Imgenex (IMH-371). Immunohistochemical stainings
for cyclin A2, Akt-pS473 and Akt-pS477/pT479 were performed as described previously44.
The cyclin A2 antibody for immunohistochemistry was purchased from Santa Cruz (sc-751),
Akt-pS473 antibody for immunohistochemistry was purchased from Cell Signaling
Technology (4060) and the Akt-pS477/pT479 antibody was generated by collaboration with
the Cell Signaling Technology and further validated in this study.
