ABSTRACT
The development of transition-metal-based antitumor drug candidates increases
the metallopharmaceuticals study dramatically. Two trans-thiosemicarbazone-based,
Schiff base palladium (Pd) (II) complexes, DMABTSPd (TSPd) and DMABPTSPd
(PTSPd), were prepared and characterized as described in our previous study. Here,
we investigated whether the two complexes have antitumor effect on human gastric
adenocarcinoma cell lines, BGC-823 and SGC-7901, compared with normal human
gastric mucosal epithelial cell line, Ges-1. The results show that the Pd complex
with the bare amino group (DMABTSPd(TSPd)) can inhibit cell viabilities and induce
apoptosis in human gastric carcinoma cells, rather than the Pd complex without the
bare amino group (DMABPTSPd (PTSPd)). This occurs via a mitochondrial-related
pathway by down-regulating the level of Bcl-2 expression and up-regulating the
level of Bid expression. Meanwhile, DMABTSPd (TSPd) suppressed tumor growth via
a mitochondrial-related pathway in a nude mouse tumor xenograft model derived
from BGC-823 cells. These findings demonstrate that DMABTSPd (TSPd) is worthy
of further structural optimization and representing a promising Pd complex for the
development of a new antitumor therapeutic agent.

INTRODUCTION

Pd complexes with a water-soluble iminophosphorane
ligand could be potential anticancer agents [8]. [1-benzyl3-tert-butylimidazol-2-ylidene] 2PdCl2 shows strong
antiproliferative activity against three types of human
tumor cells, namely, cervical cancer (HeLa), breast
cancer (MCF-7), and colon adenocarcinoma (HCT116),
in culture [7]. Especially, the Pd (II) complexes bearing
thiosemicarbazone-based Schiff bases have greater
antiproliferative activity than thiosemicarbazones, even if
thiosemicarbazones have potential therapeutic activity and
are widely used in medicine, including LM3 (mammary
adenocarcinoma) and LP07 (lung adenocarcinoma) cell
lines [10]. In the thiosemicarbazone-based Schiff base
Pd (II) complexes, the ligands are usually bonded to the
Pd (II) center with an O, N, S-tridentate coordination
mode. This tridentate coordination mode stabilizes
the Pd (II) complexes and prevents possible cis-trans
isomerization to give a more positive effect [11]. The
tridentate coordination mode of the Pd (II) complex is

The discovery of the antitumor activity of transitionmetal-based drug candidates (such as Pt, Pd, and Mo
complexes) causes research into metallopharmaceuticals
to increase dramatically [1–4]. These metal complexes
have good activity towards one or more tumor cell lines,
and some have entered clinical trials. However, the major
problems with transition-metal-based antitumor drugs
are their side effects and cell resistance, varying from
nephrotoxicity to drug resistance of the tumor cells,
along with limited applicability towards certain cancer
cell lines [5, 6]. These have prompted researchers to look
for alternative metallopharmaceuticals with improved
properties to widen the spectrum of treatable cancers,
reduce toxic side effects, and overcome metal resistance.
A series of novel palladium (Pd) complexes have
been synthesized that exhibit good activity against
tumor cell lines [7–9]. As an example, organometallic

neither cis-geometry nor trans-geometry. The importance
of the trans-geometry around the Pd center has been
attributed to the comparatively higher cytotoxicity
values compared with those for cis-isomers. In addition,
the bare amino group may play an important role in the
differences in cytotoxicity [12], this prompted us to design
trans-geometry thiosemicarbazone-based Schiff base Pd
(II) complexes, with and without bare amino group, to
study their cytotoxic effect against a selection of cell lines.
Gastric cancer is the third leading cause of cancerrelated deaths with a global burden of 723000 deaths in
2012 [13]. Many patients develop a relapse after curative
surgery, in part due to the vacancy of current therapy
agents [14]. It is urgent to find more effective therapeutic
drugs for gastric cancer therapy.
In this study, we investigated the antitumor activity
and mechanism of two trans-thiosemicarbazone, Schiff
base palladium (Pd) complexes DMABTSPd(TSPd), with
bare amino group, and DMABPTSPd (PTSPd), without
bare amino group (Figure 1A and 1B ) in human gastric
adenocarcinoma cell lines, BGC-823 and SGC-7901,
in vitro and in vivo, compared to normal human gastric
mucosal epithelial cell line, Ges-1.In our target complexes,
the thiosemicarbazone-based Schiff base Pd (II)
complexes, the ligands are bonded to the Pd (II) center
with an N, S-bidentate coordination mode. This bidentate
coordination mode stabilizes the Pd (II) complexes and
prevents possible cis-trans isomerization. The importance
of the trans-geometry around the Pd center has been
attributed to the comparatively higher cytotoxicity values
compared with those for cis-isomers. In addition, the with
and without bare amino group might play a different role
in cytotoxicity. The data confirm that DMABTSPd(TSPd)
is worthy of further structural optimization and
representing a promising Pd complex for the development
of a new antitumor therapeutic agent.

in the DMABTSPd(TSPd)-treated group in a timedependent manner, compared with the DMABPTSPd
(PTSPd)-treated group (Figure 1E and 1F). Additionally,
BGC823 and SGC7901 cells are especially sensitive
to DMABTSPd(TSPd) with IC50 values of 5.1 μg/mL
and 5.4 μg/mL, respectively, compared with the
DMABPTSPd(PTSPd)-treated group (Figure 1G and 1H).
Therefore, the data indicated that DMABTSPd(TSPd)
inhibited cell viability of BGC823 and SGC7901 cells in
a dose- and time-dependent manner, while DMABPTSPd
(PTSPd) did not. Additionally, we observed that the two
complexes had not any effect on the cell viability of
normal human gastric mucosal epithelial cell line, Ges-1
(Supplementary Figure 1).

The effect of the two complexes on cell apoptosis
of human gastric carcinoma cells
After BGC823 and SGC7901 cells were treated with
different dose of DMABTSPd(TSPd) or DMABPTSPd
(PTSPd) for 24 h, western blotting analysis showed
that DMABTSPd(TSPd) promoted the cleavage of poly
ADP-ribose polymerase (cleaved-PARP) in BGC823
and SGC7901 cells, compared with DMSO group, while
DMABPTSPd (PTSPd) did not (Figure 2A and 2B,
**P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001, ****P < 0.0001).Meanwhile,
the expression level of PCNA decreased in the two cell
lines exposed to DMABTSPd(TSPd) (Figure 2A and 2B,
*P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001, vs DMSO-group).
Therefore, DMABTSPd(TSPd) could induce apoptosis
of human gastric carcinoma cells and inhibit cell
proliferation, while DMABPTSPd (PTSPd), with a similar
structure to DMABTSPd (TSPd), could not. Additionally,
Figure 2C showed that the expression level of cleavedPARP and PCNA was not changed in human normal
gastric mucosal epithelial cell line, Ges-1, exposed to
different doses of DMABTSPd (TSPd) or DMABPTSPd
(PTSPd) for 24 h, indicating that the two complexes had
no obvious effect on cell apoptosis of human normal
gastric mucosal epithelial cells.

gastric cancer cells was determined using an MTT assay.

dose-dependent manner, compared with DMSO group.
Whereas, the treatment of DMABPTSPd (PTSPd) did
not have significant effect on cell viability of the two
cell lines, compared with DMSO group (Figure 1C

or DMABPTSPd (PTSPd) for different time points, cell
viability of the two cell lines significantly decreased

of DMABTSPd(TSPd) was measured by staining with
a mitochondrial dye, Rho123 (Rhodamine123). Rho123

was observed in the cells treated with different doses
of DMABTSPd(TSPd), exhibiting that the membrane
potential of these cells had been disrupted (Figure 3A, the
outside panel, **P < 0.01, vs DMSO-group). The data then
indicated that the DMABTSPd(TSPd)-induced apoptosis
was associated with mitochondria transmembrane
potential. Meanwhile, the expression of cytochrome
c (CYC) was also measured with western blotting
analysis. The results showed the significant decrease
of CYC expression in DMABTSPd (TSPd)-treated
BGC823 and SGC7901 cells, compared with DMSOgroup(Figure 3A, the inner side panel, **P < 0.01), while
there is no significant alteration of CYC expression in
DMABPTSPd(PTSPd)-treated BGC823 and SGC7901
cells (Supplementary Figure 2).In addition, the two target
complexes had not any effect on CYC expression in Ges-1
cells (Supplementary Figure 3).
The Bcl-2 family acts as major regulators of the
mitochondrial apoptotic pathway. Within it, Bid may
be the key regulator connecting the exogenous death
receptor-mediated apoptosis pathway and the endogenous
mitochondrial-mediated pathway, promoting the apoptotic
signal transduction; Bcl-2 protein can bind the BH3 α
helical region of pro-apoptotic proteins, inhibiting their
pro-apoptotic effect. Thus, Bid and Bcl-2 are mutually
antagonistic in the target cells. The expression levels of
Bcl-2 and Bid were then detected using western blotting
analysis. DMABTSPd(TSPd) led to the decrease of the
expression level of Bcl-2 in a dose-dependent manner
(Figure 3B, *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, vs DMSO-group).
Meanwhile, the expression level of Bid increased in a
dose-dependent manner in the cells treated with different
doses of DMABTSPd(TSPd) (Figure 3B,*P < 0.05,
**P < 0.01,***P < 0.001, vs DMSO-group). Additionally,
DMABTSPd (TSPd) had not any effect on the expression
level of cleaved-caspase3 in BGC-823 and SGC-7901
cells. Therefore, the data showed that DMABTSPd(TSPd)
may induce apoptosis via a mitochondria-related pathway
in human gastric cancer cells, not associated with the
activity of caspase3.

fragmentation resulting from apoptotic signaling cascades
[15]. In the presence of horseradish peroxidase substrate
diaminobenzidine (DAB), a very strong color reaction
(dark brown) occurs specifically in apoptotic cells, thus
apoptotic cells can be observed and counted under Olympus
X41 microscope. The results of TUNEL assay showed
that DNA damage had occurred significantly in the tumor
tissue sections of the DMABTSPd(TSPd)-treated group
(Supplementary Figure 5A and Figure 4C, **P < 0.01,
vs DMSO-group), indicating that DMABTSPd(TSPd)
led to cell apoptosis in these nude mice. Meanwhile,
DMABTSPd(TSPd) reduced the expression of Ki67 using
immunohistochemical staining (Supplementary Figure 5B
and Figure 4D, **P < 0.01, vs DMSO-group), which is an
important index refection of cell proliferation. Additionally,
the hematoxylin and eosin staining showed that the liver in
DMABTSPd(TSPd)-treated nude mice appeared to have a
normal anatomic and histological structure, indicating that
DMABTSPd(TSPd) suppressed gastric carcinoma growth
without liver damage in a nude mouse tumor xenograft
model (Figure 4E). Therefore, DMABTSPd(TSPd)
exhibited an inhibitory effect on tumor growth in a nude
mouse tumor xenograft model.
To further investigate whether the mechanism
of DMABTSPd(TSPd) inhibition on tumor growth in a
nude mouse tumor xenograft model is correlated with
mitochondrial pathways, similar to the result in vitro,
the expression level of Bid and Bcl-2 was detected
using immunohistochemistry. The results show that
DMABTSPd(TSPd) led to the increase at Bid level
(Supplementary Figure 6A and Figure 4F, **P < 0.01, vs
DMSO-group), and the decrease at Bcl-2 level in a nude
mouse tumor xenograft model (Supplementary Figure 6B
and Figure 4F, **P < 0.01, vs DMSO-group). Therefore,
the inhibition of DMABTSPd(TSPd) on tumor growth in
a mouse tumor xenograft model may be associated with
mitochondria-related pathway.

DISCUSSION
This study demonstrates for the first time that a
trans-thiosemicarbazone-based, Schiff base palladium (Pd)
(II) complex, DMABTSPd(TSPd) (with the bare amino
group), could induce apoptosis in human gastric carcinoma
cells in vitro and suppress tumor growth in a nude mouse
tumor xenograft model derived from BGC-823 cells
via a mitochondrial-related pathway, without obvious
side effect on normal human gastric epithelial cell and
mouse liver. The data indicated that DMABTSPd(TSPd)
exhibited a significant antitumor effect in human
gastric adenocarcinoma cells. However, another similar
trans-thiosemicarbazone-based, Schiff base palladium
(Pd) (II) complex, DMABPTSPd (PTSPd) (without the
bare amino group), did not have any antitumor activity. It
is suggested that DMABTSPd(TSPd) is worthy of further
structural optimization and representing a promising

(cyclophosphamide(CY)-treated group), the tumor volume
in DMABTSPd(TSPd)-treated group decreased, compared
with the control, DMSO, and DMABPTSPd (PTSPd)treated group, without the alteration of the body weight of

Pd complex for the development of a new antitumor
therapeutic agent.
Several strands of evidence show that Pd complexes
have significant anti-cancer activity and anti-drug
resistance compared with Pt chemistry [16–19]. As
an example, Pd (II) saccharinate complexes with bis
(2-pyridylmethyl) amine induce cell death by apoptosis
in human breast cancer cells in vitro [17]. A Pd (II)saccharinate complex containing terpyridine powerfully

inhibits the growth of fibrosarcoma cells by inducing
apoptosis [18]. In gastric cancer cells, [PdCl2 (L)] is a
potent chemotherapeutic agent for Cisplatin-resistant
gastric cancer and may have clinical applications [19].
Here, it is demonstrated that the trans-thiosemicarbazonebased, Schiff base palladium (Pd) (II) complex,
DMABTSPd(TSPd) (with the bare amino group), could
inhibit the cell viabilities, promote the cleavage of PARP,
and reduce the expression of PCNA, suggesting that

DMABTSPd(TSPd) induces apoptosis in human gastric
carcinoma cell lines, BGC823 and SGC7901, consistent
with the above studies. Furthermore, it is observed that
DMABTSPd(TSPd) could suppress tumor growth in a
mouse tumor xenograft model derived from BGC-823
cells, including the decrease of tumor volume and cell
proliferation, and the increase of apoptotic cells. Similarly,
a Pd(II) complex, [Pd(sac)(terpy)](sac)•4H2O, has also
been reported to exhibit a strong anticancer activity
against Ehrlich ascites carcinoma by inducing apoptosis
and suppressing proliferation in vivo [20]. Especially,
DMABTSPd(TSPd) did not have obvious effect on normal
human gastric epithelium cell, GET-1, in vitro, and did not
damage the morphological characteristics of liver in nude
mouse model, indicating that DMABTSPd(TSPd) did not
exhibit unequivocal side-effect. Therefore, the data that
DMABTSPd(TSPd) has a significant antitumor activity in
BGC823 and SGC701 cells leads to the possibility that it
becomes a new antitumor therapeutic agent.
Results presented in this manuscript showed that
the inner mitochondrial membrane potential decreased
with increasing drug dose of DMABTSPd(TSPd).
Meanwhile, the expression level of Bcl-2, one of
anti-apoptotic members, reduced with increasing
drug dose of DMABTSPd(TSPd). In contrast, the
expression level of Bid, one of pro-apoptotic members,
increased significantly with increasing drug dose of
DMABTSPd(TSPd). Similar results were detected in a
nude mouse tumor xenograft model derived from BGC823 cells. These results show that DMABTSPd(TSPd)induced apoptosis in human gastric cancer cells is largely
dependent on the endogenous mitochondrial pathway
and that the regulation protein molecules mainly include
the Bcl-2 and Bid of the Bcl-2 family members. The

regulatory mechanism of other Pd complexes associated
with mitochondrial pathway has also been reported in
prostate cancer cells. For example, a new ionic Pd(II)
complex, [(bipy)Pd(Pcurc)][CF3SO3], with the metal
center coordinated to two different chelating ligands,
the pure curcumin (Pcurc) and the 4,4′-dinonyl-2,2′bipyridine (bipy), induces both cell growth inhibition
and apoptosis of human prostate cancer cells, (LnCaP,
PC3, and DU145) through the production of ROS and
JNK phosphorylation associated with GSTp1 downregulation. ROS production induced by the Pd complex
treatment activated apoptosis through mitochondrial
membrane depolarization in all prostate cancer cells,
with up-regulation of Bax and down-regulation of Bcl-2
proteins [21]. On the other hand, caspase activation is
thought to be important for PARP-related cell apoptosis.
However, some reports have shown that PARP-dependent
toxicity appears to be caspase-independent [22, 23]. It is
implied that DMABTSPd(TSPd)-induced apoptosis may
also be in a caspase-3-independent manner in human
gastric cancer cells. Overall, the mitochondrial pathway
could be involved in regulating cell apoptosis of Pd
complex in gastric adenocarcinoma cells. Therefore, the
mechanism by which DMABTSPd(TSPd) induced gastric
cells apoptosis may be because: DMABTSPd(TSPd)
could change the mitochondrial membrane permeability
through reducing the mitochondrial transmembrane
potential and adjusting the expression of Bcl-2 and Bid,
resulting in apoptosis; DMABTSPd(TSPd) treatment
not only causes excessive activation of PARP-1, leading
to intracellular ATP/NAD depletion, which influences
mitochondrial membrane potential, but also initiates
the mitochondrial-related apoptosis pathway. The two
processes exist in synergy to induce apoptosis (Figure 5).

The biological activity of transition metal
complexes formed with different thiosemicarbazone
derivatives varies widely, and different transition metal
complexes formed with the same thiosemicarbazone
derivatives show significant differences in antibacterial
and antitumor activities. Even a slight change in the
ligand substituents while keeping the metal center the
same can have a dramatic effect on the biological activity.
In this study, DMABPTSPd (PTSPd), with a phenyl
substituent on the amino group, does not have such
activity. The differences in cytotoxicities between the two
complexes might be related to structural steric hindrance
for the DMABPTSPd (PTSPd) complex. DMABPTSPd
(PTSPd) with two phenyl substitutents may have more
steric hindrance than DMABTSPd(TSPd). The molecular
size of DMABTSPd(TSPd) is smaller than that of
DMABPTSPd (PTSPd). It might be that these two amine
groups will probably help the Pd complex to reach its
cellular target. In most of the thiosemicarbazone-based
Schiff base Pd (II) complexes, the ligands are usually
bound to the Pd (II) center with an O, N, S-tridentate
coordination mode. This tridentate coordination mode
stabilizes the Pd (II) complexes and prevents any
cis-trans isomerization to give an enhanced effect [11].
The tridentate coordination mode of the Pd (II) complex is
neither cis-geometry nor trans-geometry. The importance
of the trans-geometry around the Pd center has been
attributed to the comparatively higher cytotoxicity values
compared with those for cis-isomers. Our designed title
complexes are simply trans-geometry thiosemicarbazonebased Schiff base Pd (II) complexes. It is apparent from
the data presented over the years of reasearch into
metallopharmaceutical agents that both the metal and the
ligand determine the biological activity [1–4]. A suitable
thiosemicarbazone carrier ligand may be crucial for the
efficacy against tumors because they play an important
role in stabilizing the metal ion, imparting substituents
inertness, modifying reactivity and other positive impacts
on the target site. DMABPTSPd (PTSPd), where the only
difference in structure compared with DMABTSPd(TSPd)
is that the amino group is substituted with a phenyl
group, inhibition effect on cell viability is not obvious.
Additionally, BGC823 and SGC7901 cells are especially
sensitive to DMABTSPd(TSPd) with IC50 values of
5.1 ug/mL and 5.4 ug/mL, respectively, compared with
DMABPTSPd (PTSPd). It seems that the amino group
plays an important role in the differences in cytotoxicity
and sensitivity to cancer cells between the two complexes.

structure and DMPK properties, such as water-solubility,
could ultimately provide a new, low-toxicity, efficient, and
highly targeted antitumor drug. Interestingly, compared
with DMABTSPd(TSPd), the phenyl-substituted analog
DMABPTSPd (PTSPd) is unable to effectively inhibit the
growth of BGC823 and SGC7901 human gastric cancer
cells. It seems that the amino group plays an important
role in the different cytotoxicity of these two complexes.
Our study provides an example of how small changes in
molecular structure could lead to profound differences in
biological activity.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Reagents and antibodies
The two trans-thiosemicarbazone-based, Schiff
base palladium (Pd)(II) complexes were prepared and
characterized as described previously in our group [24, 25].
Antibodies against β-actin, Bcl-2, PARP, Ki67, Bid,
PCNA, and Caspase-3 were purchased from Santa Cruz
Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA, USA). The other
common reagents used were all commercially available.

Cell culture and treatment with the two
complexes
The human gastric cancer cell lines BGC-823 and
SGC7901, and normal human gastric mucosal epithelial
cell line Ges-1 were obtained from the Shanghai Institute
of Cell Biology, Chinese Academy of Sciences (Shanghai,
China), and were maintained in RPMI1640 supplemented
with 10% FBS, 100 U/mL penicillin, and 100 μg/mL
streptomycin, at 37°C in a water-saturated atmosphere of
5% CO2. Cells were treated by the two drugs as indicated
dose or time point, respectively, with the highest dose
DMSO as the control group.

General procedures for IC50 determination of the
target complexes
Cells were plated in 96-well plates (3 × 103 cells/well).
After 24 h, the cells were treated with drugs or DMSO
at the indicated doses in centuplicate. 20 μl MTT reagent
was added to the wells and incubated at 37°C for 4 h
before and after the treatment period of 48 h. The media
was then discarded gently and 150 μL DMSO was added,
followed by the incubation at room temperature for
15 min and the detection at 570 nm. The initial rate data
collected were used for determination of IC50 values. For
IC50 determination, kinetic values were obtained directly
from nonlinear regression of substrate–velocity curves in
the presence of various doses of inhibitor using one-site
competition in GraphPad Prism 6 scientific graphing
software [26, 27].

CONCLUSIONS
In summary, our study has investigated the
antitumor activity and molecular mechanism of the
apoptosis of DMABTSPd(TSPd), a potential antitumor
therapeutic agent. Further optimization of its chemical

Cell viability assay

Cells were resuspended in 100 μL of 5 μM
Rhodamin123 staining buffer. After incubation at 37°C
for 30 min, cells were immediately subjected to flow
cytometry analysis [26, 27].

for further routine histological preparation. Fourmicrometer-thick sections were deparaffinized in xylene
and rehydrated in graded alcohols and distilled water.
After antigen retrieval, endogenous peroxidase activity
was blocked with 3% hydrogen peroxide in methanol
for 10 min at room temperature followed by rehydration
in PBS, and incubation with 10% goat serum for
10 min to bind nonspecific antigens. As described in the
manufacturer’s instructions (MAIXIN.BIO, Fuzhou,
China), the sections were incubated overnight at 4°C with
Ki67, Bcl-2, and Bid (1:100 dilutions) primary antibody
and, subsequently, with secondary antibody (1:400) for
60 min at room temperature. Diaminobenzidine was used
to visualize the immunohistochemical reaction followed
by counterstaining with hematoxylin. In accordance with
previous studies [30], the average optical density (OD)
of positive cells was measured and analyzed using an
ImagePro Plus 6.0 system.

Western blotting analysis

Hematoxylin and eosin staining

Protein extracts were electrophoresed on 8–12%
denaturing gel and electroblotted onto nitrocellulose
membrane. The membrane was incubated with various
antibodies as required at 4°C overnight, followed by the
addition of the corresponding secondary antibody at room
temperature for 3–4 h. An ECL kit (Pierce, Rockford,
IL,USA) was used to detect the antibody reactivity [28, 29].

Fresh liver samples from the five groups were observed
and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 48 h, and then paraffin
embedded for further routine histological preparation. Fivemicrometer-thick sections were deparaffinized in xylene and
rehydrated in graded alcohols and distilled water, followed
by hematoxylin and eosin staining.

Cells were plated in 96-well plates (3 × 103 cells/well).
After 24 h, the cells were treated with drugs or
DMSO at the indicated doses, followed by an MTT
(3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium
bromide, MTT) assay [28]. The product was then dissolved
in dimethylformamide and quantified spectrophotometrically
at a wavelength of 490 nm with a reference wavelength of
630 nm as described previously [28, 29]. The OD values
correspond to the number of viable cells.

Tissue TUNEL assay

Xenograft assay in nude mice

For in situ visualization of apoptotic cells, the
TUNEL assay was performed in tumor tissue according
to the manufacturer’s instructions with in Situ Cell Death
Detection Kit, POD (Roche Diagnostics, Shanghai,
China). In TUNEL staining, dark brown cells were
considered to be positive and were counted throughout
microscopically magnified fields (magnification ×100) of
each tissue section. The percentage of positive cells was
analyzed by SPSS v.15.0 for Windows [30].

Fifty 6-week-old female BALB/Cnu/nu nude mice
were purchased from Shanghai SLAC Laboratory Animal
Co. Ltd (Shanghai, China). All animal studied were fed
until each body weight were higher than 25 g and then
were conducted according to the regulations of the IACUC
protocol. The study was approved by the Committee on the
Ethics of Animal Experiments of the University of Xiamen
(ID No. 20130916). 200 μl BGC-823 cells (2 × 106/mouse)
in culture medium were subcutaneously injected into the
left flank of the mouse. Animals bearing tumors were
randomly assigned to five groups; vehicle control group
(double-distilled water), cyclophosphamide(CY) (purity
100%; Sigma-Aldrich, Shanghai, China) group, DMSO
group, DMABTSPd(TSPd) group, and DMABPTSPd
(PTSPd) group with 10 mice per group. After a
72-h injection of BGC-823 cells, mice were injected
intratumorally with indicated agents once every 3 days for
21 days [28]. Tumor volume was measured and analyzed
using the SAS program PROCMIXED during this period.
All mice were killed and examined for the growth of
subcutaneous tumors at 24 h after stopping the injection.

Statistical analysis
Data were expressed as means ± S.D. of at least
three independent experiments, and statistical analysis
for single comparison was performed using the Student’s
t test. The criterion for statistical significance was p < 0.05.
