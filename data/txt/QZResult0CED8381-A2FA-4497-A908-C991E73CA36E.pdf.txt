Abstract
Chronic pain is commonly and closely correlated with inflammation. Both
cannabinoid signaling and mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have been demonstrated
to reduce inflammatory pain. Although cannabinoid signaling is essential for
mesenchymal stem cell survival and differentiation, little is known about its role in
modulatory effect of MSCs on inflammation and pain sensitivity. Here we showed
that mouse bone-marrow derived MSCs (BM-MSCs) expressed both cannabinoid
receptor type 1 and 2 (CB1 and CB2). CB2 expression level in BM-MSCs increased
with their maturation. In addition, we found that tetrahydrocannabinol (THC)
activated CB2 receptor and ERK signaling, consequently enhancing the modulation
of MSCs on inflammation-associated cytokine release from lipopolysaccharidesstimulated microglia. Consistent with in vitro data, THC pretreatment enhanced
the immunomodulatory effects of BM-MSC on thermal hyperalgesia and mechanical
allodynia in chronic constriction injury model, by decreasing the release of proinflammation cytokines. Our study revealed the crucial role of THC in promoting the
immunomodulatory effects of MSCs and proposed a new strategy to alleviate pain
based on stem cells therapy.

Introduction

is the most widely studied compound [5-7].
The main receptor targets for cannabinoid signaling
are type-1 and type-2 G protein-coupled cannabinoid
receptors (CB1 and CB2) [8]. CB1 is widely expressed
mainly at the terminal ends of central and peripheral
neurons in the nervous system [9]. Once activated, CB1
is involved in the inhibition of excitatory and inhibitory
neurotransmission, and can modulate cognitive, memory
and motor functions, as well as analgesia [10]. CB2 is
mainly expressed in the cells of the immune system, where
it is commonly associated with the regulation of different
immune functions including chronic inflammation of

Cannabis sativa L. is an annual, dioecious herb,
belonging to the family of Cannabaceae and originating
from Eastern and Central Asia [1, 2]. It has long been used
as a sedative, analgesic and anti-inflammatory agent [3,
4]. Phytocann-abinoids or cannabinoids are considered the
major compound responsible for the biological activities
of Cannabis sativa L. More than 100 cannabinoids have
been identified so far, among which tetrahydrocannabinol
(THC), as the main psychoactive constituent of Cannabis,

the nervous system [11]. CB2 receptors are shown to
be upregulated in the central nervous system and dorsal
root ganglia by pathological pain states [8, 9]. Numerous
behavioral, neurochemical and electrophysiological
studies have indicated CB2 as a therapeutic target for
treating pathological pain states with limited centrally,
mediated side effects [6, 12-14].
Multipotent mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have
been shown to exhibit immunosuppressing properties
[15]. They generate a local immunosuppressive
microenvironment by secreting cytokines [16]. Some
studies have documented that MSCs can release growth/
neurotrophic factors as well as anti-inflammatory
proteins, which modulate microglial responses to proinflammatory stimuli [17-19]. Moreover, single intra-brain
or intravenous injections were shown to ameliorate neuroinflammation and associated behavior in animal models
of neuropathic pain, such as sciatic nerve constriction,
contusion injury or spared nerve injury [20].
In this study, we investigated the role of cannabinoid
THC in enhancing the immunomodulatory function of
bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells (BMMSCs). We studied the process in which THC promoted
the immunomodulatory effect of BM-MSCs on primary
microglial cultures activated by lipopolysaccharide (LPS),
a standard stimulus to trigger pro-inflammatory microglial
reactions. Furthermore, we used chronic constriction
injury (CCI) mouse model to explore the stimulation of
THC on anti-inflammatory effect of BM-MSCs.

Phenotypic characterizarion of mouse BM-MSCs
The mouse BM-MSCs in culture exhibited a typical
spindle-shaped morphology (Figure 1a). When they
were assessed by flow cytometry, they expressed typical
surface markers Sca-1 and CD44, but not CD14, CD33 or
CD45, which is the characteristic phenotype of BM-MSCs
(Figure 1b-1f). The differentiated cells were positive for
alizarin red and oil red staining, indicating the BM-MSCs
were able to differentiate into osteogenic and adipogenic
lineages (Figure 1g). Taken together, the above results
suggested the cultured cells are bona fide BM-MSCs.

Expression of CB1 and CB2 receptors in BMMSCs
We measured expressions of CB1 and CB2 receptors
in BM-MSCs at P0, P1, P3, P5 and P7 by RT-PCR. We
found that mature mRNA for both CB1 and CB2 receptors
were prominently expressed on BM-MSCs. Moreover,
mRNA level of the CB1 receptor was significantly
decreased from P1 and continued to decline with the
increase of passage numbers (Figure 2a). An opposite
trend was observed for the CB2 receptor mRNA, which
was markedly up-regulated with the increase of passage
number and reached its maximum level at P5 (Figure 2b).
Western blot analysis revealed the same trend in protein
levels of CB1 and CB2 receptors at different passages.
Consistent with its mRNA expression, protein level of
CB1 was at the highest at P0 and gradually decreased with

with LPS. However, the lowest release of inflammatory
cytokines from microglia when stimulated by LPS was
observed when they were grown in THC pre-treated BMMSCs supernatant (Figure 3d-3g). Meanwhile, the level
of anti-inflammatory cytokine, IL-10, was significantly
increased by THC or BM-MSC supernatant without THC
treatment, while the highest release was observed in the
THC pre-treated BM-MSCs supernatant group (Figure
3h).

Dose-dependent effects of THC treatment on
viability, proliferation and immunomodulatory
effects of BM-MSCs
To explore the effects of THC on BM-MSCs, we
first treated BM-MSCs with different concentrations of
THC (0.5–10 μM). We found THC treatment for 24 h at
low concentrations (0.5, 1 or 2 μM) had no observable
effect on the viability and proliferation of BM-MSCs,
while THC at higher concentrations (5 or 10 μM)
significantly decreased cell viability and proliferation
(Figure 3a and 3b). Therefore we used 1 μM of THC to
treat BM-MSC in the rest of our study. To further identify
the impact of THC on the immunomodulatory effect of
BM-MSCs, we collected the supernatant of BM-MSCs
treated with THC as conditional medium (CM) to culture
primary microglia, and examined the expressions of
inflammatory cytokines in the presence or absence of LPS
(Figure 3c). Compared to control cells not grown in CM or
stimulated with LPS, LPS stimulation alone significantly
increased the amount of inflammatory cytokines secreted
by microglia, such as TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6 and IL-8.
Microglia cultured in the presence of THC or BM-MSCs
supernatant without THC treatment secreted markedly
reduced levels of inflammatory cytokines when stimulated

Activation of CB2 receptors by THC stimulated
IL-10 release and the ERK pathway in BM-MSCs
We further explored the potential mechanism of
THC up-regulating the immunomodulatory effects of
MSCs. We examined the expression of anti-inflammatory
cytokine IL-10 in BM-MSCs before and after THC
treatment. ELISA assay revealed that THC treatment
at 1 μM for 24 h increased the release of the antiinflammatory cytokine IL-10 from MSCs (Figure 4a).
Consistently, Western blot analysis showed an increase in
the intracellular IL-10 level upon THC treatment (Figure
4b, 4c). The CB2 antagonist AM630 negated the increase
of both secreted and intracellular IL-10, whereas CB1
antagonist AM251 had no such effect (Figure 4a-4c).
Accordingly, we found that the phosphorylated ERK1/2,
known to be involved in CB2 stimulation of IL-10 release
[21], was also increased in the THC-treated group, which
was attenuated by AM630 but not AM251 (Figure 4d, 4e).

c., and stimulated p-ERK1/2 expression d., e. The release of IL-10 from BM-MSCs was measured by ELISA. The protein expressions
of intracellular IL-10 and p-ERK1/2 were analyzed by western blot analysis and normalized to GAPDH. Meanwhile, THC treatment
significantly caused CB2 receptor expression in BM-MSCs f., g. CB2 antagonist, AM 630, greatly blocked the THC-induced elevation of
IL-10 release, intracellular IL-10 expression, p-ERK1/2 expression and CB2 expression, while AM251 (CB1 antagonist) failed to. Data
were presented as mean ± SEM. *p < 0.05 and **p < 0.01 versus control group, ##p < 0.01 versus THC group.

Meanwhile, we observed an increase in the CB2 receptor
expression by THC, which was reduced by its antagonist
AM630 (Figure 4f, 4g). Also, the phosphorylation of Akt
was greatly enhanced in the presence of THC, and PI3K
inhibition by wortmannin significantly decreased Akt
phosphorylation (Supplementary Figure S1).

Effects of THC pretreated BM-MSC on ipsilateral
sciatic nerve cytokines

THC pretreatment enhanced the effects of BMMSC on thermal hyperalgesia and mechanical
allodynia

We next examined the mRNA and protein levels of
pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6 and antiinflammatory cytokine IL-10. As expected, expressions
of all cytokines increased significantly in CCI mice
compared to control (Figure 6). However, 7 days after
MSC administration, mRNA of TNF-α, IL-1β and IL-6
decreased dramatically in ipsilateral sciatic nerve of CCI
mice. More importantly, THC pretreated MSC injection
further decreased the mRNA levels of pro-inflammatory
cytokines, which could be attenuated by CB2 antagonist
AM630 (Figure 6a-6c). Interestingly, we observed an
increase in IL-10 mRNA level after MSC injection,
which could be enhanced by THC pretreatment whereas
attenuated by AM630 (Figure 6d). Changes in the protein
profiles were consistent with that of mRNA (Figure 6e6h).

In order to assess the function of THC in vivo, we
investigated its role as therapeutic option in neuropathic
pain. MSCs were administrated into the animals after pretreated with 1 μM THC for 24 h in the presence or absence
of CB2 antagonist AM630 after 7 days from sciatic injury,
when neuropathic pain was already established. Pain
behavior was evaluated at 0, 7, 14, 21, and 28 days after
injection. Administration of THC pre-treated MSCs in
the CCI mice tail vein induced a significant reduction
in hyperalgesia (Figure 5a) and allodynia (Figure 5b) 7
days after injection. The effect on thermal hyperalgesia
was gradually reduced from day 7, which was similar
to MSC or MSC with AM630 treated CCI mice after 21
days, but still significantly different from vehicle-treated
CCI at day 28 (Figure 5a). On the other hand, the effect
on mechanical allodynia was maintained until day 14 and
reduced to the same level as MSC or MSC with AM630
treated groups at day 21. At day 28, there was no obvious
difference between all CCI mouse groups (Figure 5b).
Moreover, animals were tested for anxiety-like behaviors
on the elevated plus-maze. There was no significant
differences in the percentage open arm entries of the total

Effect of THC pre-treatment on the percentage of
BM-MSCs in the sciatic nerve
To exclude the possibility that THC pre-treatment
may alter the percentage of BM-MSCs in the sciatic
nerve after MSC injection, we isolated and sectioned the
sciatic nerve and counted the GFP-labeled MSC cells
with or without THC pre-treatment. We found there was
no difference in percentage of GFP positive cells between

these two groups (Figure 7), indicating the increase in
immunomodulatory ability of BM-MSC by THC pretreatment was not due to an increase of total number of
BM-MSCs in the sciatic nerve.

We next focused on how THC enhanced the
modulation of MSCs on inflammation-associated cytokine
release from LPS-stimulated microglia, the main resident
immune cells in the central nerve system [18]. Consistent
with previous findings, THC or MSCs alone significantly
reduced the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines
including TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6 and IL-8, and increased the
release of anti-inflammatory cytokines, IL-10 (Figure 3).
Interestingly, the maximum effect was observed when
microglia were grown in CM from MSCs pre-treated with
1 μM of THC, suggesting THC can strongly upregulate the
immunomodulatory effects of MSCs. In a previous study,
different concentrations of THC (0.5, 5 and 50 μM) have
been tested. Although THC at 0.5 μM modestly decreased
cytokine release, significant effect was only seen when
THC was used at much higher concentrations [40]. Our
data showed that MSCs pre-treated with THC at the
concentration as low as 1 μM significantly suppressed the
LPS-induced inflammation response in microglial cells.
It is worth noting that THC also exhibits psychoactive
effect, therefore dosage is important when considering
its clinical application as anti-inflammatory reagent
[41]. Strong psychotropic effects both in humans and
experimental animals have been widely reported [42-46].
Adverse behavioral symptoms of THC exposure include
anxiety and hypolocomotor effects [46]. In our study,
THC-pretreated BM-MSCs were centrifuged and the
supernatants were completely discarded to ensure no THC
was administrated into the body. Also, THC pre-treated
MSCs were found to have no obvious impact on anxietylike behaviors (Supplementary Figure S2). This strategy
therefore avoided the psychoactive effects of THC when
used for pain relief.
We further explored the potential mechanism of
THC up-regulating the immunomodulatory effects of
MSCs. We found THC treatment increased both secreted
and intracellular levels of IL-10 in MSCs (Figure 4a4c). Since IL-10 has been shown to be increased by CB2
activation through the ERK 1/2 pathway [39], we also
investigated the expressions of p-ERK1/2 and CB2. We
found that both p-ERK1/2 and CB2 levels were increased
upon THC treatment (Figure 4d, 4e). Interestingly, the
increase in IL-10, p-ERK1/2 and CB2 was negated by CB2
antagonist AM630, but not CB1 antagonist AM251 (Figure
4), indicating that CB2, instead of CB1, was crucial for
THC promoted anti-inflammation pathway activation in
MSCs. Similar results have been reported previously in
hMSCs [39]. It has been shown that stimulation of the CB2
receptor partially reversed the LPS-induced modulation
of pro- and anti- inflammatory cytokines in hMSCs and
directly activated the ERK2 pathway [39]. Rather than
activating CB2 by agonist in LPS stimulated MSCs, our
results showed that treating cells with THC induced the
same effects in MSCs at physiological condition. Worthy
of mentioning, many studies revealed that the activation
of the PI3K/Akt pathway is linked to the neuroprotective

Discussion
Chronic pain is common and debilitating with few
effective therapeutic options [7]. It is well-known that
pain and inflammation are closely correlated [13, 22].
Pain induced by tissue damage provokes the production
or secretion of inflammatory mediators such as cytokines,
prostanoids and neuropeptides [23]. Inflammatory
mediators also produce neural effects involving
activation of nociceptors, free nerve endings which act
as receptors for pain [24]. There is growing literature
regarding cannabinoids as potential analgesics because
they have been shown to reduce inflammatory pain [5,
25-28]. Moreover, several clinical trials on THC have
demonstrated significant pain reductions in patients with
multiple sclerosis or chronic pain [3, 11, 29-31]. On the
other hand, stem cell-based therapies also hold promise
for pain treatment [32]. Transplantation of MSCs has been
demonstrated to be a potentially therapeutic approach for
the alleviation of chronic pain from various studies [3335]. The MSCs relieve pain hypersensitivity through
suppression of pain-related signaling cascades and reduced
inflammatory cell recruitment [15]. Cannabinoid signaling
is essential in regulating cell proliferation, differentiation
and survival, with different outcomes depending on the
molecular targets and cellular context involved [36].
Also, CB1 receptor is essential for the survival and
differentiation of MSCs [9]. However, little is known
about the role of cannabinoid signaling in modulatory
effect of MSCs on inflammation and pain sensitivity. Here
we showed that THC pre-treatment significantly enhanced
the immunomodulatory effect of BM-MSCs both in vitro
and in vivo.
Both CB1 and CB2 are reported to be expressed in
BM-MSCs, where they play important roles in regulating
their proliferation and differentiation [37, 38], which is
consistent with our study that BM-MSCs expressed both
CB1 and CB2 receptors (Figure 2). A significant change
in endocannabinoid levels, concurrently with a sensible
modification of CB2 or CB1 receptor expression, was
observed during the different in vitro culture passages. We
showed that expression of the CB2 receptor was barely
detectable at the first passage and increased through the
following ones, whereas CB1 expression showed the
opposite trend (Figure 2). Interestingly, this inversely
correlated regulation, at least in part, mimicked the same
trend of receptor expression in hMSCs [39]. It has been
suggested that MSCs are regulated in a way to respond
to external cannabinoids via CB2 receptor activation, to
perform specific tasks such as immunosuppression and
anti-inflammatory action [39].

effects of cannabinoids [47-49]. To date it is not clear
whether PI3K/Akt pathway is activated by THC treatment,
and our current study demonstrated that THC presence
could activate PI3K/Akt pathway in MSCs, suggesting
PI3K/Akt may be a common pathway for cannabinoids to
exert their biological effects.
In this study, we also showed that the intravenous
MSC administration ameliorated neuropathic pain
symptoms using the CCI model (Figure 5), consistent
with published results [50]. More importantly, THC pretreated MSC injection induced much stronger inhibition
of hyperalgesia and allodynia at early time point (7 days
after injury), but the inhibitory effect was gradually
reduced with the increase in time. We speculate that the
up-regulation of MSC immunomodulatory effect by THC
is time limited in vivo, and repeated administration of
THC pre-treated MSCs may sustain the anti-inflammatory
effect of MSCs. Further studies are needed to explore
this possibility. Consistent with what we observed in
vitro, expressions of TNF-α, IL-1β and IL-6 decreased
dramatically in ipsilateral sciatic nerve of CCI mice after
MSC administration, and THC pre-treatment induced
further reduction. On the contrary, THC enhanced the
up-regulation of IL-10 by MSCs (Figure 6). In addition,
we also excluded the possibility that the increase in
immunomodulatory ability of BM-MSC by THC pretreatment was merely due to the increase of total number
of BM-MSCs in sciatic nerve (Figure 7).
In conclusion, we investigated the role of THC in
promoting the immunomodulatory effect of MSCs on
inflammation and neuropathic pain sensitivity. We found
that BM-MSCs expressed both CB1 and CB2 receptors,
and THC at low concentration significantly enhanced
the modulation of MSCs on inflammation-associated
cytokine release from LPS-stimulated microglia. We also
found the immunomodulatory effect of MSC by THC was
up-regulated in CCI mouse model, where both thermal
hyperalgesia and mechanical allodynia were alleviated.
Taken together, our study indicated THC pre-treated
MSCs as a potential therapeutic strategy in inflammation
and pain treatment with more profound effects.

containing DMSO (final concentration: 0.01%). Cells
were treated with AM630 or AM251 for 24 hours before
examination.

CCI model
Painful neuropathy was induced on 20- to 25-g
C57BL/6J male mice. CCI model for mice was described
before [50]. Briefly, animals were anaesthetized with
sodium pentobarbital (60 mg/kg, intraperitoneal, 0.1
ml/10g) and, under a dissecting microscope, the right
common sciatic nerve was exposed at the level of the
mid-thigh and, proximal to the trifurcation of the nerve;
three ligatures (4/0 chromic silk, Ethicon) were loosely
tied around it, at about 0.5mm spacing, until they elicited a
brief twitch in the respective hind, taking care to preserve
epineural circulation. Sham-operated animals (sciatic
exposure without ligation) were used as controls.

Thermal hyperalgesia and mechanical allodynia
evaluation
48 mice were used in this study. Each group has
8 animals. Measurements were performed on both the
ipsilateral and contralateral hind paws of all mice by
researchers blind to treatments. Thermal hyperalgesia was
measured as previously described using a Plantar Test
Apparatus [47, 48]. Mechanical allodynia was assessed
using the Dynamic Plantar Aesthesiometer, as previously
described in detail [47, 48].

BM-MSCs culture
BM-MSCs were obtained from the femurs of adult
C57BL/6J mice. Bone marrow cells were incubated
in α-MEM supplied with 20% FBS (Gibco, Carlsbad,
CA) and 1% antibiotics (Penicillin G 10,000 units/
ml, streptomycin 100 µg/ml) in the humidified CO2
incubator at 37oC for 5 d. The debris and suspended
cells were removed and attached cells were maintained
in DMEM-F12 supplemented with 10% heat inactivated
FBS, 1% Glutamine, and 1% Penicillin/Streptomycin.
MSCs were characterized by flow cytometry. They
were also tested for their osteogenic and adipogenic
differentiation ability, in order to confirm the actual
mesenchymal stem cell identity. Transduction of NSCs
with a lentiviral vector carrying the Green Fluorescent
Protein (GFP) gene was carried as previously described
[50]. After five passages of purification in vitro, MSCs
were used for this study.

MSC administration into CCI mice

Primary culture of microglia

Cell administration was always performed starting
7 days after CCI, when the pain hypersensitivity was
maximal. Cultured mouse MSCs or MSCs pre-treated with
THC alone or with AM630 were collected and centrifuged
to get rid of THC. The cell pellets were re-suspended with
medium and mechanically dissociated to a single cell
suspension in phosphate-buffered saline solution with
2.5% heparin and injected intravenously into the caudal
vein of mice. The amount of cells and their concentration
were 1×106 cells/200 μl. Both sham and CCI mice were
injected with the same amount of vehicle or MSCs at the
same time points. Thermal hyperalgesia and mechanical
allodynia were evaluated in all mouse groups immediately
before surgery and at day 7 after surgery, prior to cell
injection (time 0). The subsequent evaluations were
performed at days 3, 7, 14, 21, and 28 after the first MSC
administration.

Primary cultures were obtained from one day old
C57BL/6J mice. Cerebra were dissected and meninges
removed in HBSS/Hepes buffer. Brains were chopped
with a razor blade. The brain pieces were put into 15 ml
tube and were then centrifuged for 5 min at 3000 rpm at
RT. For dissociation the pellet was incubated with trypsin
(0.1%) at 37°C for 20–30 min, under shaking. DNase
(0.001%) was added and the tubes were turned upside
down several times. The tubes were centrifuged at 3500
rpm for 5 min at RT. The supernatant was discarded and
the red blood cells were removed with a Pasteur pipette.
The remaining pellet was triturated through a flamenarrowed glass pipette until a single cell suspension
was obtained. The cells were seeded in DMEM (4.5
g/L Glucose, [+] L-Glutamine, [−] Pyruvate), 10%FBS,
1% Penicillin/Streptomycin onto poly-L-lysine (diluted
1:1000, Sigma, Steinheim, Germany) coated flasks. The
next day, the culture medium was removed, cells were
washed with PBS and new culture medium was added.
Medium was changed every second day. On day 10–13,
tissue culture flasks were closed tightly with parafilm
and shaken for 30 min at 180 rpm at 37°C on an orbital
shaker-incubator (Edmund Bühler, Hechingen, Germany)
and plated on culture dishes (Nunc, Roskilde, Denmark).
Microglial purity was more than 95% as determined by
CD11b (AbD Serotec, Kidlington, UK) immunoreactivity.

Flow cytometry
MSCs were characterized by flow cytometry using
PE conjugated monoclonal antibodies specific for the
following antigens: CD44, Sca-1, CD34, CD14 and CD45.
All antibodies were purchased from BD Biosciences
(Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA). Appropriate, isotype-matched,
non-reactive fluorochrome-conjugated antibodies were
employed as controls. Analysis of cell populations was
performed by means of direct immunofluorescence with
a FACSCanto flow-cytometer (BD Pharmingen) and data
were elaborated using the FACSDiva software (TreeStar
Inc., Ashland, OR).

Conditioned medium (CM) collection and the
following culture of primary microglia
MSCs were seeded at a density of 3.0×103 per
cm2. After rinsing with PBS, Neurobasal medium
supplemented with 1% B27, 1% Penicillin/Streptomycin,
0.5 mM L-glutamine, and 2% FBS was added. After 24
h treatment with THC, supernatants from MSC cultures
were collected, and centrifuged at 3,000 rpm for 5 min to
remove remaining cells. Debris was removed by rinsing
the supernatant through a 0.22 µm filter and designated
as conditioned medium (CM) for primary microglia.
Microglia cultured in CM was then stimulated with 100
ng/mL lipopolysaccharide (LPS, Sigma) for 24h for
subsequent examination.

Western blot
Total protein was extracted using RIPA lysis
buffer (Cell Signaling, Irvine, CA, USA). 20 to 50 μg
of protein were separated on gradient polyacrylamideSDS gels (Applygen, Shanghai, China) and transferred
to Nitrocellulose Membranes (Biorad). After blocking
with TBST with 5% nonfat dry milk (Applygen) for 1
h, the membrane was incubated with antibodies against
CB1 (1:200), CB2 (1:200), IL-10 (1:400) (Abcam,
Cambridge, UK), p-ERK1/2 (1:200, Cell Signaling) and
GAPDH (1:100, Santa Cruz, Dallas, TX, USA) overnight
at 4 degree. This was followed by incubation with HRPconjugated secondary antibodies (1:500, Pierce, Shanghai,
China) for 1 h at room temperature. Antibody binding
was visualized by an enhanced chemiluminescence kit
according to the manufacturer’s protocols (Pierce).

MTT cell viability assay
Cell viability of BM-MSCs after THS treatment was
assessed via the MTT (3-(4, 5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,
5-diphenylte-trazolium bromide) assay (Sigma), which
measures the ability of cells to reduce MTT to formazan.
After acid isopropanol extraction, formazan absorbance
was quantified at 570 nm with a reference wavelength of
630 nm (Tecan spectrophotometer, Salzburg, Austria).

CCK-8 cell proliferation assay

(Applied Biosystems, Waltham, MA, USA), and the
mRNA levels of the indicated genes were analyzed in
triplicate using SYBR Green master mixture (Applied
Biosystems) and a Chromo-4 real time RT-PCR instrument
(MJ Research, St. Bruno, Quebec, Canada). The mRNA
levels were normalized to GAPDH (internal control) and
gene expression was presented as -fold changes (ΔΔCt
method).

Cell proliferation rate was assayed using CCK8 (Dojindo). 1×104 BM-MSCs were seeded on 96-well
culture plates (Corning, NY, USA) and treated with THS at
indicated concentrations for 24 h. OD value at 450 nm was
evaluated using an ELISA Reader (Promega, Madison,
WI, USA) following the manufacturer’s instructions.

Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)

Osteogenic differentiation and Alizarin red
staining (ARS)

The protein expression of TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8
and IL-10 was determined by the corresponding ELISA
kit (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN, USA) according to
the instructions. To measure the cytokine release in cells,
the supernatants were collected and centrifuged, and then
the cell-free supernatants were used for ELISA assay. To
measure the cytokine release in ipsilateral sciatic nerves,
the nerve samples were homogenized in 0.40 ml of icecold phosphate-buffered saline containing a protease
inhibitor cocktail (Sigma) and centrifuged at 10,000 g for
15 min, and the supernatant was used for ELISA assay.
Cytokine concentrations were determined by interpolation
with standard curves assayed on individual plates and
normalized to protein content in each sample.

BM-MSCs were plated in 24-well plates in
triplicate at a density of 10×104 cells/cm2 the previous
day and then treated with osteogenic supplements (OS)
consisting of DMEM supplemented with 2% FBS, 5
mM β-glycerophosphate, and 50 μM L-ascorbic acid2-phosphate, or cultured in DMEM with 2% FBS, as a
control. ARS staining was performed to evaluate the
calcium deposition in cells of the osteogenic lineage
obtained from BM-MSCs. Briefly, cells cultured in a 24well plate for 21-28 days were rinsed twice with PBS,
fixed with 10% v/v formalin and then stained with 1% w/v
ARS solution. Orange red staining indicated the location
and intensity of the calcium deposition. The presence of
calcium was observed using light microscope Olympus
IX71 (Olympus Corporation, Tokyo, Japan).

Statistical analysis
Data are reported as the mean ± SEM of the number
of experiments indicated in each case. One-way ANOVA
followed by a Student Newman-Keuls post hoc test was
used to determine the statistical significance between
groups. For comparisons between relevant treatments, an
unpaired Student’s t-test was performed.

Adipogenic differentiation and oil red staining
For adipogenic induction, cells were seeded in
24-well plates at a density of 30,000 cells/cm2. After the
cells reach confluence, they were treated with adipogenic
induction medium (DMEM containing 10% FBS, 1 μM
dexamethasone, 60 μM indomethacin, 10 μg/ml insulin,
and 0.5 mM 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine) for 3 days and
then switched to adipogenic maintenance medium (growth
medium plus 10 μg/ml insulin) with media replaced every
other day. The formation of adipocytes was evaluated
by oil red staining. Briefly, cells were washed with PBS
and incubated with 10% formalin for 1h. Cells were then
washed with distilled water and 60% isopropanol and
dried completely, followed by Oil Red O working solution
(Sigma) incubation for 10min. The solution was removed
and cells were washed with water before monitored by
microscope.
