Abstract
Previous reports have shown that honokiol induces apoptosis
in numerous cancer cell lines and showed preclinical
efficacies against apoptosis-resistant B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia and multiple myeloma cells from relapserefractory patients. Here, we show that honokiol can induce a
cell death distinct from apoptosis in HL60, MCF-7, and
HEK293 cell lines. The death was characterized by a rapid
loss of integrity of plasma membrane without externalization
of phosphatidyl serine. The broad caspase inhibitor z-VADfmk failed to prevent this cell death. Consistently, caspase
activation and DNA laddering were not observed. The death
was paralleled by a rapid loss of mitochondrial membrane
potential, which was mechanistically associated with the
mitochondrial permeability transition pore regulated by
cyclophilin D (CypD) based on the following evidence: (a)
cyclosporin A, an inhibitor of CypD (an essential component
of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore), effectively
prevented honokiol-induced cell death and loss of mitochondrial membrane potential; (b) inhibition of CypD by RNA
interference blocked honokiol-induced cell death; (c) CypD
up-regulated by honokiol was correlated with the death rates
in HL60, but not in K562 cells, which underwent apoptosis
after being exposed to honokiol. We further showed that
honokiol induced a CypD-regulated death in primary human
acute myelogenous leukemia cells, overcame Bcl-2 and BclXL–mediated apoptotic resistance, and was effective against
HL60 cells in a pilot in vivo study. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first report to document an induction of
mitochondrial permeability transition pore–associated cell
death by honokiol. [Cancer Res 2007;67(10):4894–903]

Introduction
Cancer drug resistance is a major problem in chemotherapy. The
potency of anticancer drugs is largely determined by their efficacies
in selectively killing cancer cells and simultaneously inducing
drug resistance in cancer cells. Conventional anticancer agents,
regardless of their targets and mechanisms, mostly induce apoptosis. Cancer cells are usually sensitive to apoptotic induction
initially, but become resistant eventually (1–3). Apoptotic machi-

nery is composed of at least dozens of antiapoptotic and
proapoptotic proteins. The balance of antiapoptotic and proapoptotic proteins contributes to the balance of cell growth and cell
death. Many lines of evidence have shown an imbalance with
elevated antiapoptotic and reduced proapoptotic activities in
cancer cells one way or another, including overexpression of antiapoptotic proteins (Bcl-2, Bcl-XL, Mcl-1, c-FLIP, IAP, and heat shock
proteins), mutations of proapoptotic proteins (p53, Apaf-1, Bax,
FAS, FADD, and caspase), and loss of caspases (caspase-3 and
caspase-8; refs. 4–6). Therefore, besides apoptosis, the other targets
which trigger nonapoptotic cell death may compliment defects of
the apoptotic machinery (7–10).
Mitochondria plays a central role in cell death. It serves as an
integrator of upstream death signaling. Most importantly, mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization is a committed point
in cell death (11, 12). Thus, strategies based on targeting the
mitochondrial permeability transition pore, the main mechanism
of mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization by interfering
with vital mitochondrial functions, provide us with new opportunities for therapeutic intervention and may help to overcome
resistance to standard cancer therapies (11, 13–15). There are
several potential pharmacologic targets on the mitochondrial
permeability transition pore, such as the voltage-dependent anion
channel, the bongkrekic acid–sensitive adenine nucleotide translocase, and cyclophilin D (CypD), which are regarded as key factors
in the regulation of mitochondrial permeability transition pore
function and cell death (11, 15–19).
Honokiol, a pharmacologically active component present in the
traditional Chinese medicinal herb, Magnolia species, is of multiple
medicinal uses against microbial infection, anxiety, oxidative stress,
and platelet aggregation, among others (20, 21). Previous reports
have shown the anticancer activities of honokiol. Honokiol induced
apoptosis in cancer cell lines, including murine endothelial SVR
cells (22), human colorectal carcinoma RKO cells (23), and human
squamous lung cancer CH27 cells (24). Honokiol repressed RKO
and angiosarcoma growth in nude mice (22, 25). Recently, two
important studies showed that honokiol effectively induced
caspase-dependent or -independent apoptosis in apoptosis-resistant B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL) from B-CLL
patients and multiple myeloma (MM) cells from relapse-refractory
MM patients. The effective dose of honokiol was not toxic to
normal blood cells (26, 27).
In this study, we show that honokiol can induce a CypDregulated cell death in HL60, MCF-7, HEK293 cell lines, and in
primary human acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) cells. This
death is distinct from apoptosis and is closely associated with the
CypD-dependent mitochondrial permeability transition pore. The
capability of inducing cell death through both apoptosis and
nonapoptosis makes honokiol a more versatile ‘‘killer’’ of cancer
cells.

Honokiol Induces a Necrotic Cell Death

Materials and Methods
Reagents and antibodies. Honokiol was purchased from the National
Institute for the Control of Pharmaceutical and Biological Products (Beijing,
China) with >99% purity. RPMI 1640, FCS, and 0.25% trypsin were purchased
from Life Technologies; reverse transcription-PCR kit was purchased from
Promega; staurosporine, vitamin E, butylated hydroxyanisole, cyclosporin A
(CsA), bongkrekic acid, N-acetyl-L-cysteine, and Hoechst 33342 were
purchased from Sigma. The broad-spectrum caspase inhibitor z-VAD-fmk
was from Calbiochem. Primary antibodies used were: mouse monoclonal
antibodies anti-CypD, anti-Bcl2, and anti-Bcl-XL (Calbiochem), anti–h-actin
(Sigma), anti–caspase-8, and rabbit polyclonal antibodies anti–apoptosisinducing factor (AIF), anti–caspase-9 (Cell Signaling Technology). The
secondary antibodies were FITC or horseradish peroxidase–conjugated
anti-rabbit and anti-mouse IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Plasmid pSFFVNeo, pSFFV-Bcl-2, and pSFFV-Bcl-XL were kindly provided by Dr. Steven
Grant (Medical College of Virginia, Virginia Commonwealth University,
Richmond, VA).
Primary human AML cells. AML patient samples and three normal
peripheral blood samples were collected after informed consent and the
approval of the hospital’s institutional review board. Patients were not
receiving therapy at the time of sampling. AML bone marrow specimens with
high blast counts (ranging from 75% to 95% as determined by Wright-Giemsa
stain), which was supported by immunophenotyping (Supplementary
Table S1), were from the Department of Hematology, the First Affiliated
Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine. The three normal peripheral blood specimens were acquired from the Blood Bank, Hangzhou, China.
Because the patients had high blast counts, enriched AML cell populations
containing >95% tumor cells could be prepared using a density gradient
separation of samples (Ficoll-Hypaque, Sigma; ref. 28). The mononuclear cells
were cultured in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% FCS. Normal peripheral
blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were prepared as described above. Viability
on samples was >90% as determined by a trypan blue exclusion assay.
Cell cultures and generation of stable cell lines. HL60, MCF-7 cells, or
primary AML cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 containing 10% FCS and
300 mg/L of glutamine (Life Technologies), and HEK293 was maintained in
DMEM containing 10% FCS and 300 mg/L of glutamine. Cells were grown in
a humidified CO2 incubator at 37jC, and subcultured with 0.25% trypsin
0.02% EDTA. MCF-7/Neo, HEK293/Neo, MCF-7/Bcl-2, HEK293/Bcl-2,
MCF-7/Bcl-XL, and HEK293/Bcl-XL cells were obtained by transfection with
pSFFV-Neo, pSFFV-Bcl-2, and pSFFV-Bcl-XL cells, respectively, using
LipofectAMINE2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. HL60/Neo, HL60/Bcl-2, and HL60/Bcl-XL cells were derived by
transfection of HL60 with pSFFV-Neo, pSFFV-Bcl-2, and pSFFV-Bcl-XL cells,
respectively, via electroporation with a Nucleofection system (Amaxa, Inc.)
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. After 48 h of transfection, the
transfectants were selected in a medium containing 800 Ag/mL of G418
(Invitrogen) for 2 to 3 weeks. The colonies were then amplified, the
expression of Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL cells were analyzed by Western blotting.
RNA interference. MCF-7 and HEK293 cells were transfected with either
nonspecific or CypD RNA interference (RNAi; final concentration, 100 nmol/L)
via LipofectAMINE 2000 according to the manufacturer’s instructions
(Invitrogen). The cells were then incubated for 96 h prior to Western blot or
propidium iodide (PI) exclusion assay. RNAi was introduced into HL60
using a Nucleofection system (Amaxa) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. The cells were then incubated for 48 h prior to immunoblot
analysis or PI exclusion assay. The RNAi duplex oligo-ribonucleotides were
from Invitrogen. The RNA sequences were as follows: (siRNA no. 1) sense,
5¶-UUU GAC GUG ACC GAA CAC AAC AUGC-3¶; antisense, 5¶-GCA UGU
UGU GUU CGG UCA CGU CAAA-3¶; (siRNA no. 2) sense, 5¶-UAG CUC AAC
UGG CCACAG UCU GUGA-3¶; antisense, 5¶-UCA CAG ACU GUG GCC AGU
UGA GCUA-3¶. BLOCK-iT Fluorescent Oligo (Invitrogen) was used as a
quality control to assure the transfection efficiency with Stealth RNAi.
Nonspecific RNAi with the same GC content as siRNA nos. 1 and 2 was used
as a negative control.
Treatment of cells with honokiol. Unless otherwise stated, throughout
this study, HL60 was treated with honokiol at 15 Ag/mL for 12 h, MCF-7 and

www.aacrjournals.org

HEK293 were treated with honokiol at 40 Ag/mL for 6 h. DMSO (0.1%) was
used as vehicle control for all assays.
Apoptosis assays. Apoptotic rates were analyzed by flow cytometry
using Annexin V-FITC/PI kit (Sigma) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. The procedure was carried out according to the previous
reported methods (29). Lower left quadrant, viable cells; lower right
quadrant, AV-positive but PI-negative cells (PS externalized apoptotic cells);
upper left and right quadrants, necrotic cells. Alternatively, the apoptotic
cells were either visually examined for nuclear fragmentation using Hoechst
33342 or detected for hypodiploid percentage using PI as described
previously (29, 30).
DNA gel electrophoresis. After treatments, 3  106 cells were harvested
and washed in PBS. Afterwards, it was processed according to previously
reported methods (10).
Measurement of caspase-3/DEVDase activity. Caspase-3 activity was
measured using a caspase-3/CPP32 colorimetric assay kit (BioVision
Research Products) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Samples
were expressed as fold increase on the basal level (DMSO-treated cells).
PI exclusion assay. The loss of integrity of the plasma membrane was
determined by PI (Sigma) exclusion assay. After drug treatment, cells were
mixed with 30 Ag/mL of PI, and dead cells permeable to PI were counted by
a fluorescence-activated cell sorter (FACSCalibur, Becton Dickinson).
Immunofluorescent staining of AIF. The procedure was carried out
according to previously reported methods (10). After cellular AIF staining,
nuclei were stained with PI for 10 min. Samples were examined under an
Olympus FV1000 microscope equipped with a 40 oil immersion lens
(numerical aperture, 1.2). Images were processed with FV10-ASW software
(Olympus). The procedure was carried out at room temperature.
Assessment of permeability transition pore opening by confocal
imaging. After drug treatment, 2 to 4  104 cells were spun down onto
slides, the cells were washed with HBSS and 10 mmol/L of HEPES (HH
buffer, pH 7.2) before staining with 1 Amol/L of calcein-AM ester (Molecular
Probes) and 5 mmol/L of CoCl2 at room temperature for 15 min. The CoCl2
was added to quench the cytoplasmic fluorescence so that only the calceinAM fluorescence trapped in the mitochondria was imaged (31, 32). Cells
were washed four times and resuspended in HH buffer before being
examined under an Olympus FV1000 microscope (Olympus). Images were
processed with the FV10-ASW software (Olympus). A band-pass filter of
525 nm was used for capturing the calcein images, and Nomarski optics
was used to obtain differential interference contrast images of the cells.
To determine the mitochondrial calcein-AM fluorescence levels, individual
cells were identified using Nomarski optics and the total mitochondrial
fluorescence per cell was measured using Northern Eclipse software,
version 5.0.
Reactive oxygen species production and mitochondrial membrane
potential. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) and mitochondrial membrane
potential (MMP; Dcm) were measured according to the previous reported
methods (31, 32). Briefly, after treatment with honokiol, cells were incubated
in RPMI 1640 containing 50 Amol/L of DCFH-DA for 30 min and ROS was
scored using a FACSCalibur flow cytometer, and data were analyzed on
CellQuest software, version 3.1 (Becton Dickinson). MMP was probed by
5,5¶,6,6¶-tetrachloro-1,1¶,3,3¶-tetraethyl-benzimidazolylcarbocyanine iodide
(JC-1, a potential-sensitive probe; Molecular Probes) using a FACSCalibur.
Briefly, cells were harvested and incubated with medium containing JC-1
(10 Ag/mL) for 10 min, washed, and resuspended in 1 mL of PBS for flow
cytometry analyses. Controls were done in the presence or absence of
50 Amol/L of fluoro-carbonyl cyanide phenylhydrazone (Merck) for 12 h for
MMP or 30% H2O2 for 1 h for ROS. In all cases, samples were gated to
exclude cellular debris.
Electron microscopy. Treated cells were washed and fixed for 30 min in
2.5% glutaraldehyde. The samples were treated with 1.5% osmium tetroxide,
dehydrated with acetone and embedded in Durcupan resin. Thin sections
were poststained with lead citrate and examined in the TECNAI 10 electron
microscope (Philips, Holland) at 60 kV.
Western blot analysis. The procedure was carried out according to
previously reported methods (29). The protein was applied to a 10% to 15%
SDS-polyacrylamide gel, transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane, and then

visualization with a chemiluminescence kit (Pierce). Visualization was
done with a Molecular Imager FX (Bio-Rad Laboratories) using Kodak ID
imaging densitometry analysis software on a Macintosh.
Real-time PCR. CypD mRNA was analyzed by quantitative real-time
reverse transcription-PCR. After honokiol treatment, cells were collected
for total RNA extraction by a TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) according to
the manufacturer’s instructions. The quality of the total RNA was confirmed
by the integrity of 28S and 18S rRNA. The first-strand cDNA was synthesized
from extracted RNA using an Oligo-dT as primer. PCR was done in triplicate
in 50 AL reaction volumes using 1.5 AL of cDNA, SYBR Premix Ex Taq
containing deoxynucleotide triphosphates (Takara-Bio), 1 AL of carboxyrhodamine reference dye (1:400 dilution), and 5 pmol of each primer. PCR
was done using CypD primers (5¶-TGGCTAATGCTGGTCCTAAC-3¶ and
5¶-TGGATGTCCTCCCACTCTTAG-3¶) and b-actin (5¶-TTCCAGCCTTCCTTCCTGGG-3¶ and 5¶-TTGCGCTCAGGAGGAGCAAT-3¶). Primers for CypD
spanned exons 5 and 6, and primers for b-actin spanned exons 3 and 5.
Samples were amplified in a 7700 real-time PCR system (PE Applied

Biosystems) for 40 cycles using the following PCR variables: samples were
heated at 95jC for 10 s, followed by 40 cycles of amplification of 95jC for 5 s,
and 60jC for 30 s. The fluorescent signal was determined using a sequence
detector software (PE Applied Biosystems), giving the threshold cycle
number (C T) at which PCR amplification reached a significant threshold.
Then the DC T value was defined as the difference of the C T values between
CypD and b-actin, the internal standard. Accordingly, DC T = (CypD mRNA
C T) (h-actin mRNA C T), and the relative CypD mRNA expression level was
presented as 2 DC T.
PCR was also done in a DNA thermal cycler (Perkin-Elmer) according to
previously reported methods (29). The reaction condition used was initial
denaturation for 5 min at 95jC followed by 35 cycles of denaturation for
15 s at 95jC, primer annealing for 15 s at 60jC, polymerization for 15 s at
72jC, and final extension for 5 min at 72jC. PCR products were separated
on ethidium bromide–stained 1.5% agarose gels. Expected reverse
transcription-PCR sizes were 161 bp for CypD and 250 bp for b-actin.

(Shanghai SLAC Laboratory Animal, Co. Ltd.) were inoculated i.p. with
2  107 HL60 cells, or were irradiated with 2.0 Gy by a 137Cs gamma-ray
source prior to i.v. inoculation with 1  107 HL60 cells. Six days after
inoculation, animals were grouped randomly and administered i.p. with
100 mg/kg of honokiol or vehicle control suspended in 20% Intralipid (SinoSwed Pharmaceutical, Corp. Ltd.) with a total volume of 200 AL daily for
6 consecutive days. The survival time of mice was monitored on the daily
basis.
Statistical analyses. Unless otherwise stated, data were expressed as the
mean F SD, and analyzed by Student’s t test.

Results
Honokiol induces cell death with necrotic characteristics.
Because the optimal concentrations of honokiol to induce apoptosis in B-CLL and MM cells from patients were f20 Ag/mL
(26, 27), and the concentration of honokiol at <10 Ag/mL was
nontoxic to HL60 cells (33), we treated HL60 cells with honokiol at
10, 15, and 20 Ag/mL for 18 h. Unexpectedly, honokiol induced a
dominant death characterized by a loss of plasma membrane
integrity (PI positivity) but without a significant externalization of
phosphatidyl serine (Annexin V-FITC positive; Fig. 1A; ref. 34).
Consistently, there was neither activation of caspase-3, caspase-8,
and caspase-9 (although caspase-3, caspase-8, caspase-9 activation

was observed in etoposide–treated cells; Fig. 1C; Supplementary
Fig. S2B), nor was there apoptotic DNA laddering (Supplementary
Fig. S1), nor a significant hypodiploid peak (Supplementary Fig.
S2A). The broad-spectrum caspase inhibitor z-VAD-fmk also failed
to prevent honokiol-induced cell death (Fig. 1B). These results
indicated that caspases were not involved in honokiol-induced
HL60 cell death. The similar results of dominant necrotic death or
caspase independence (Fig. 1D; Supplementary Fig. S2C), and the
lack of a hypodiploid peak (Supplementary Table S2) were also
obtained with MCF-7 and HEK293 treated with honokiol.
Morphologically, honokiol-treated cells did not exhibit apoptotic
nuclear fragmentation (Fig. 2). Instead, cells had a necrotic death
morphology. In HL60 cells, many rounded mitochondria with
damaged internal cisternae were observed, although the inner and
outer membranes of the mitochondria seemed to be intact in most
cells (Fig. 2A-c). There was extensive vacuolation of cytoplasmic
organelles and some dense bodies. High-power examination of
these structures revealed a heterogeneous mixture of electronlucent and electron-dense regions, many of which were vacuoles
and autophagosomes (Fig. 2A-d, e, and f ). Honokiol-treated MCF-7
and HEK293 cells showed similar necrotic characteristics to HL60
cells (Fig. 2B). Taken together, these results indicate that honokiol
induced a nonapoptotic death in HL60, MCF-7, and HEK293 cells.

Honokiol-induced death does not involve a nuclear translocation of AIF. Because honokiol could induce a caspaseindependent apoptosis by triggering nuclear translocation of AIF
(27), we examined if this protein was involved. As shown in
Supplementary Fig. S3A, AIF was not translocated to the nuclei in
honokiol-treated HL60 cells, although staurosporine-treated cells
(a positive control) did have the nuclear localization of AIF.
Honokiol-induced death is associated with a loss of MMP
(#Ym) and an increased production of ROS. Because ultrastructural studies revealed the damaged mitochondria in honokioltreated cells, we hypothesized that honokiol-induced death was
probably due to mitochondrial dysfunction. As shown in Fig. 3A
and B, the loss of Dcm was time-dependent and occurred
significantly as early as 6 h after honokiol treatment (Fig. 3A),
accompanied with the production of ROS (Fig. 3B).
Honokiol-induced death is associated with the mitochondrial permeability transition pore. Opening of the permeability
transition pore may result in dissipation of Dcm and respiratory
inhibition of ROS production. In another way, prior to the loss of
Dcm, proapoptotic Bcl-2 family members may contribute to the cell

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (10). May 15, 2007

death, through action on the mitochondrial outer membrane
(35, 36). Because Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL overexpression (Supplementary
Fig. S3D) could not inhibit honokiol-induced death in these cells
(Supplementary Fig. S3B and C), the participation of the major
Bcl-2 family members in honokiol-induced cell death was largely
overruled.
Next, we examined the opening of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore. The status of the permeability transition
pore can be determined with the membrane-permeating fluorescent probe calcein-AM, which freely enters but is not able to exit
mitochondria except through an open permeability transition pore
(31, 32). HL60 cells started to lose mitochondrial calcein-AM
fluorescence as early as 4 h after drug exposure, indicating a rapid
opening of the permeability transition pore (Fig. 3C and D).
Honokiol-induced death is associated with CypD. To confirm
that the cell death was the result of opening of the permeability
transition pore, we examined the effect of permeability transition
pore inhibitors on honokiol-induced cell death and mitochondrial
damage. CypD, adenine nucleotide translocase, and voltagedependent anion channels are the major components of the

permeability transition pore (11, 12, 15, 18, 19, 31, 35–38). CsA and
bongkrekic acid are two permeability transition pore inhibitors which
work by interacting with CypD and adenine nucleotide translocase,
respectively. Although CsA could prevent honokiol-induced cell
death (Figs. 1D and 4A and B; Supplementary Fig. S5A), opening
the permeability transition pore, leading to loss of Dcm and
generation of ROS (Fig. 3), bongkrekic acid did not have inhibitory
effects (Supplementary Fig. S5B).
To further determine the role of CypD in honokiol-induced cell
death, we did RNAi to knock down the endogenous CypD. The
BLOCK-iT Fluorescent Oligo was used as a quality control to assure
the transfection efficiency, and a nonspecific RNAi (with the same
GC content as siRNA nos. 1 and 2) was used as a negative control.
In three cell lines, the transfection efficiencies were all >90%. As
shown in Fig. 4C, 96 h after one single transfection with siRNA no. 1
and siRNA no. 2, CypD was reduced by 85% and 70%, respectively,
in MCF-7, and by 75% and 60%, respectively, in HEK293. Forty-eight

hours after a single transfection with siRNA no. 1 and siRNA no. 2
by electroporation with the Amaxa system, CypD in HL60 was
decreased by 80% and 85%, respectively. Consistently, knockdown
of CypD via RNAi significantly prevented honokiol-induced cell
death (Fig. 4D).
To further elucidate the role of CypD in the process of cell death,
we examined the expression of CypD responding to honokiol
treatment. The expression of CypD mRNA in HL60, MCF-7, and
HEK293 after honokiol treatment was time-dependent. CypD
mRNA increased in the early phase and then declined (Fig. 5A
and B). Similar patterns of CypD protein change were also
observed (Fig. 5C and D). The decline of CypD in the later time
points was probably a consequence of the cellular and physiologic
collapse in the later phase of cell death. In the early phase of cell
death, honokiol up-regulated CypD in a dose- and time-dependent
manner, which correlated with the death rates in HL60 cells
(Supplementary Fig. S4). Interestingly, CypD did not change

significantly in K562 cells after honokiol treatment (Fig. 5). Further
examination revealed that honokiol induced an apoptosis in K562
cells, which was not prevented by CsA (Supplementary Fig. S6;
Supplementary Table S3). The results indicated that the cell death
induced by honokiol seemed to be initiated by the up-regulation of
CypD, which then triggered the opening of the permeability
transition pores, and were consistent with the established evidence
that up-regulation of CypD promoted the mitochondrial permeability transition that led to necrosis, whereas knockout of this
protein desensitized cells to necrosis (18, 19, 37–41).
Honokiol shows anticancer activities in vivo. A prolonged
survival time was observed after treatment with honokiol in severe
combined immunodeficiency mice inoculated (i.p. or i.v.) with
human HL60 cells engrafts. As shown in Fig. 6D, in the i.v. group,
six vehicle control animals were all dead by day 20 after implantation, in contrast to the first death on day 23 in the honokiol

group. The median survival times of the vehicle and honokiol
groups were 17 and 29 days, respectively. Similarly, in the i.p. group,
five vehicle control animals were all dead by day 30 after
implantation, in contrast to the first death on day 33 in the
honokiol group. The median survival times of the vehicle and
honokiol groups were 24.5 and 37.5 days, respectively.
Effects of honokiol on primary human AML cells. The above
results prompted us to investigate if honokiol could also induce a
CypD-regulated cell death in primary human AML cells. Among
primary cells from a total of 14 patients treated with honokiol, 10
samples underwent a death inhibited by CsA (Table 1). In these
samples, honokiol displayed a concentration- and time-dependent
killing of AML cells characterized by a loss of plasma membrane
integrity (PI positivity) but without a significant externalization of
phosphatidyl serine (Annexin V-FITC–positive; Fig. 6A and B). The
death was inhibited by CsA but not z-VAD-fmk (Fig. 6B; Table 1).

Honokiol Induces a Necrotic Cell Death

Honokiol also significantly up-regulated CypD in AML cells such as
HL60 cells. The results indicated that the induction of CypDassociated death in human primary AML cells may have potential
clinical significance. Honokiol was significantly more toxic toward
AML cells than normal PBMCs (Fig. 6A; Table 1), agreeable with
previous reports (26, 27).
Because honokiol was able to induce either apoptosis or CypDassociated cell death in different types of cells, it was not surprising
that honokiol did not exclusively induce CypD-regulated death in
AML cells from different individual patients. The mechanisms

whereby honokiol induces apoptosis or necrosis would be further
addressed in the next section.

Discussion
This study, combined with previous reports, revealed that
honokiol could induce different death modes in different cancer
cells. Honokiol induced apoptosis in numerous cancer cells
(22–24). Phenotypically, honokiol-induced apoptosis could be
either caspase-dependent or -independent (26, 27). In the

varying concentrations of honokiol in the presence or absence of CsA (5 Amol/L) for the time indicated. Cell death was determined by a PI permeability assay. Data are
from patient 2 as a representative. PBMCs from three healthy donors were isolated and treated with varying concentrations of honokiol for 24 and 48 h (bottom ),
and cell death was determined by a PI permeability assay. B, mononuclear cells from patients with AML pretreated with or without 50 Amol/L of z-VAD-FMK or 5 Amol/L
of CsA for 2 h were treated either with honokiol at the indicated concentrations, or 100 Ag/mL of VP-16 (as an apoptosis control), then subjected to apoptosis by
Annexin V/PI staining. Data from patient no. 2. C, CypD protein level in honokiol-treated AML cells was determined by Western blotting with h-actin as an internal

NOTE: Cells were incubated with or without 5 Amol/L of CsA for 2 h prior to treatment with various concentrations of honokiol for 24 h. Cells were

caspase-independent mode, AIF played a critical role (27). Here, we
presented that honokiol induced a cell death in HL60 that was
distinct from apoptosis but was closely associated with CypDregulated mitochondrial permeability transition pore. More importantly, honokiol could induce a similar death to HL60 in primary
human AML cells from different individuals, and it was effective
against HL60 in vivo and against several cancer cell lines overexpressing Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL. The ability of honokiol to trigger
multiple death pathways strongly suggests its effectiveness and
versatility in killing cancer cells.
Although the apoptotic or necrotic signaling induced by
honokiol is largely unknown, the caspase-dependent and independent apoptosis triggered by honokiol seemed to be closely
related to the regulation of the bcl-2 family members (23, 24, 26,
27), which had been well documented to affect mitochondrial outer
membrane permeability (1, 11, 12, 15, 36). In necrotic signaling,
honokiol targeted the CypD-regulated mitochondrial permeability
transition pore, eventually leading to mitochondrial outer membrane permeability. Therefore, although honokiol could induce
different modes of cell death, the death signals by honokiol finally
converge in the mitochondria. It is the death signals on the
mitochondria that decide between apoptosis or necrosis. If
honokiol modulated the Bcl-2 family protein, it would most
probably initiate apoptosis because the pore size perforated by
dimerization of Bax/Bak allowed the release of cytochrome c, AIF,
EndoG, and HtrA2/Omi (42). Indeed, the honokiol-triggered
apoptotic process involved the up-regulation of proapoptotic
members and the down-regulation of antiapoptotic members of
the Bcl-2 family, release of mitochondrial cytochrome c, activation
of caspase, and translocation of AIF (23, 24, 26, 27). If honokiol
signaled to permeability transition pore regulated by CypD, it
would most probably lead to a nonapoptotic death because the
opening of permeability transition pore not only caused a loss of
Dcm essential for synthesizing ATP, but also accelerated ATP
hydrolysis (7, 43). Considering that apoptosis is an ATP-dependent
process, depletion of ATP by a massive mitochondrial dysfunction
would favor necrosis (7, 43). Although the permeability transition
pore would eventually cause the rupture of the mitochondrial outer
membrane, and release of apoptotic death effectors, these events
could be a downstream consequence of the onset of necrosis.
Previous reports have revealed that CypD-related mitochondrial

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (10). May 15, 2007

permeability transition led to necrosis, but argue against its
involvement in apoptosis (18, 19, 37–41). Consistently, honokiol
induced a nonapoptotic death in HL60 featured with a significant
up-regulation of CypD, but no observable caspase activation and
AIF translocation, and the death was not inhibited by Bcl-2/Bcl-XL
(Supplementary Fig. S3B–D). Therefore, the molecular mechanisms
whereby honokiol induces cytotoxicity via apoptosis or necrosis are
determined by its signals on mitochondria. A similar principle
could be extrapolated as to why honokiol did not exclusively
induce CypD-associated death in primary AML cells from different
individual patients. To date, the signals upstream of mitochondria
induced by honokiol are, unfortunately, poorly understood.
Intracellular ROS was elevated after being exposed to honokiol. It
has been well documented that besides activating caspase-9, ROS
could induce necrosis (44, 45). In some context, intracellular ROS
elevation was a downstream consequence of the opening of the
permeability transition pore (31, 43, 46). In this study, although
antioxidants (vitamin E, butylated hydroxyanisole, and N-acetyl-Lcysteine) blocked ROS production (Supplementary Fig. S7B), they
did not prevent cell death (Supplementary Fig. S7A), whereas CsA, a
non-antioxidant, effectively prevented cell death (Figs. 1D and 4A
and B; Supplementary Fig. S5A), strongly suggesting that ROS
elevation in HL60 by honokiol was a downstream consequences of
the dysfunction of mitochondrial permeability transition pore
regulated by CypD.
Honokiol has potential value in clinical applications. Honokiol
displayed a satisfactory selectivity between cancer cells (B-CLL, MM,
and AML) and normal PBMC (refs. 26, 27; and this study). Our
previous pharmacokinetic studies (25) in mice revealed that
honokiol was readily absorbed and maintained in the plasma for
>10 h. The plasma concentration attainable in mice in vivo was
1,000 Ag/mL at a dose of 250 mg/kg of honokiol via gastric intubation,
significantly exceeding the levels that were toxic to tumor cells
in vitro (25, 47). The safety of honokiol is indirectly reflected by the
facts that Hou-pu, a Magnolia species, from which honokiol is
extracted, is listed in the Chinese Pharmacopoeia and indexed as a
tonic, sedative, and blood-activating and stasis-dissolving prescription, and that Saiboku-to, synonymous with Hou-pu in Japan, has
entered clinical trials in Japan for the treatment of asthma (48).
In summary, this study revealed that honokiol induced a death
pathway regulated by the mitochondrial permeability transition

pore, in which CypD played a key role. Combined with previous
reports, honokiol is a potent anticancer agent which should be
examined for further clinical application.
