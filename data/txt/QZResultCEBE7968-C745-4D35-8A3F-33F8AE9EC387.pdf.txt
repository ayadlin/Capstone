BACKGROUND: A phase 3 trial demonstrated superiority at interim analysis for everolimus over placebo in patients with
metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC) progressing on vascular endothelial growth factor receptor–tyrosine kinase inhibitors.
Final results and analysis of prognostic factors are reported. METHODS: Patients with mRCC (N ¼ 416) were randomized
(2:1) to everolimus 10 mg/d (n ¼ 277) or placebo (n ¼ 139) plus best supportive care. Progression-free survival (PFS) and
safety were assessed to the end of double-blind treatment. Mature overall survival (OS) data were analyzed, and prognostic
factors for survival were investigated by multivariate analyses. A rank-preserving structural failure time model estimated the
effect on OS, correcting for crossover from placebo to everolimus. RESULTS: The median PFS was 4.9 months (everolimus)
versus 1.9 months (placebo) (hazard ratio [HR], 0.33; P < .001) by independent central review and 5.5 months (everolimus)
versus 1.9 months (placebo) (HR, 0.32; P < .001) by investigators. Serious adverse events with everolimus, independent of
causality, in 5% of patients included infections (all types, 10%), dyspnea (7%), and fatigue (5%). The median OS was 14.8
months (everolimus) versus 14.4 months (placebo) (HR, 0.87; P ¼ .162), with 80% of patients in the placebo arm crossed over
to everolimus. By the rank-preserving structural failure time model, the survival corrected for crossover was 1.9-fold longer
(95% confidence interval, 0.5-8.5) with everolimus compared with placebo only. Independent prognostic factors for shorter
OS in the study included low performance status, high corrected calcium, low hemoglobin, and prior sunitinib (P < .01).
CONCLUSIONS: These results established the efficacy and safety of everolimus in patients with mRCC after progresC 2010 American Cancer Society.

Everolimus in Renal Cell Carcinoma/Motzer et al

The RECORD-1 (Renal Cell cancer treatment with
Oral RAD001 given Daily) trial assessed everolimus in
patients with metastatic RCC (mRCC) who progressed
on vascular endothelial growth factor receptor–tyrosine
kinase inhibitor (VEGFR-TKI) therapy. A preplanned interim analysis reported that everolimus-treated patients
had superior progression-free survival (PFS) compared
with placebo-treated patients.3 The independent data
monitoring committee halted the trial, and the study was
unblinded (end of double-blind treatment phase).
Herein, updated efficacy and safety results are
reported until the end of double-blind treatment in the
full data set of 416 patients. Efficacy data are also reported
for patients who progressed on placebo, were unblinded,
and crossed over to open-label everolimus. Mature overall
survival (OS) data at 13 months after interim analysis data
cutoff are presented. Exploratory OS analysis was performed to correct the treatment effect estimate for bias
introduced by crossover from placebo to open-label everolimus after disease progression. Because the mRCC treatment paradigm has changed, assessment of pretreatment
prognostic factors for PFS and OS in patients with
VEGFR-TKI refractory tumors was undertaken. This is
the first assessment of prognostic factors in this
population.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients and Study Design
Study design for RECORD-1 has been described.3 The
population comprised patients with clear-cell mRCC and
disease progression during or within 6 months of stopping
sunitinib and/or sorafenib. Prior therapy with cytokines
and/or VEGF inhibitors (eg, bevacizumab) was permitted. Patients gave written informed consent.
In this prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, international, multicenter, phase 3 trial
(Clinicaltrials.gov identifier: NCT00410124), eligible
patients were randomized (2:1) to receive everolimus 10
mg/d orally plus best supportive care (BSC) or matching
placebo plus BSC. Study drug was provided by Novartis
Oncology (Florham Park, NJ), the trial sponsor. Randomization was stratified by Memorial Sloan-Kettering
Cancer Center prognostic criteria for patients with previously treated mRCC (favorable, intermediate, or poor)4
and prior VEGFR-TKI therapy (1 vs 2 prior VEGFRTKIs). Blinded treatment was discontinued for progression, unacceptable toxicity, or study discontinuation.
Investigators were blinded to study group assignments;

disclosure was permitted after documented Response
Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) progression by investigator assessment. Patients who progressed
by investigator assessment were unblinded, and those
assigned to placebo were offered open-label everolimus.
Specific toxicities allowed dose interruption and
reductions to 5 mg daily or every other day. Protocol and
amendments were reviewed by local independent ethics
committees or institutional review boards, and the study
was conducted using established ethical principles.
Efficacy and Safety Endpoints
The primary endpoint was PFS by central review. Secondary endpoints included safety, objective response rate, OS,
and quality of life. Tumor response was assessed by
RECIST,5 with the use of imaging studies at scheduled
intervals by treating physicians and an independent thirdparty core imaging laboratory.3 Assessment of central
review response was discontinued at double-blind treatment end (February 28, 2008), when the primary endpoint was met at the interim analysis and study treatment
was unblinded.
Safety evaluations were performed as reported.3
Patient-reported outcomes were assessed using the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy–Kidney Symptom
Index, Disease Related Symptoms questionnaire administered monthly on Day 1 of treatment cycle and at discontinuation. In this report, PFS, objective response rate,
patient-reported outcomes, Karnofsky performance status
(KPS), and safety data are provided through February
2008. Mature OS data are provided for data cut off of November 2008.
Statistical Analysis and Study Conduct
Original sample size (n ¼ 362) was calculated using an
unstratified 1-sided sequential log-rank score test with a
cumulative type I error of a ¼ .025, and a cumulative
power 1  b ¼ 90% was used for a 3-look group sequential plan. Assuming a hazard ratio (HR) of 0.67 corresponding to median PFS of 4.5 (everolimus/BSC) and 3.0
months (placebo/BSC) and a 2:1 randomization, 290
PFS events were required for the final analysis. Two interim analyses were performed when approximately 30%
and approximately 60% of the targeted 290 PFS events
(per central radiology assessment) had been reached. The
actual study data cutoff for the second interim analysis
was October 15, 2007; data for 410 patients collected
until this cutoff were analyzed in February 2008, and
results were reviewed by an independent data monitoring

committee. The prespecified efficacy boundary for primary endpoint (O’Brien-Flemming type stopping rule)
was crossed at this interim analysis, the study was
unblinded, and the double-blind phase of the trial was terminated on February 28, 2008; 6 placebo-treated patients
still on study were offered open-label everolimus.
In this analysis, 416 randomized patients were analyzed for efficacy (Full Analysis Set population) including
an additional 6 Japanese patients enrolled between September 1 and November 5, 2007. These 6 patients were
necessary to complete a commitment required by the Japanese Health Authority. The safety population (n ¼ 411)
included patients who received 1 dose of study drug
with 1 valid postbaseline safety assessment. Data for this
analysis were collected until the end of double-blind treatment (February 28, 2008) and based on 266 PFS events
(vs 191 PFS events at the interim analysis), 6 additional
accrued patients, and 4.5 months of additional blinded
follow-up. The previously presented OS data cutoff was
October 15, 2007, compared with November 15, 2008
for the analysis reported herein.
PFS and OS were compared between groups with a
stratified, 1-sided, log-rank test adjusting for strata
defined by Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center risk
criteria. HRs were obtained from a stratified Cox model.
Sensitivity and supportive evaluations of PFS included
subgroup analyses and analyses of investigator
assessments.
A post hoc exploratory OS analysis was performed
using a rank-preserving structural failure time model to
correct the treatment effect estimate for bias introduced
by crossover from placebo to open-label everolimus after
disease progression.6,7 The rank-preserving structural failure time model provides a randomization-based estimate
of treatment effect assuming a multiplicative effect of
treatment on survival time.7 The approach also allows
reconstruction of the placebo survival curve as if all
patients initially randomized to placebo never switched to
everolimus. This is the first study to apply rank-preserving
structural failure time modeling in RCC; however, this
model has been used in a phase 3 trial of sunitinib in gastrointestinal stromal tumors.8
An analysis was performed investigating the impact
of a prespecified set of prognostic factors (demographics,
prior treatment, clinical features, specific laboratory values
at baseline) on PFS and OS. Univariate and multivariate
Cox proportional hazard models were applied, both stratified by randomized treatment (everolimus vs placebo), to
adapt for treatment effect. Categorization of continuous

4258

factors was based on prespecified cutoff points. Model
building started with the full model (all prespecified factors included); the final multivariate Cox model was
obtained using backward variable elimination with selection level a ¼ .05. Continuous factors were investigated
assuming a linear effect and investigating for a potential
nonlinear effect.9,10

RESULTS
Patient Characteristics and Disposition
Baseline characteristics were balanced between treatments
(Table 1). The intent-to-treat population comprised 277
(everolimus) and 139 (placebo) patients (Fig. 1). Eightynine patients had received 1 prior systemic treatment, and
327 patients had received >1 treatment. Safety population included 274 (everolimus) and 137 (placebo)
patients; 5 patients (3 everolimus, 2 placebo) were
excluded because they did not receive study medication.
At the end of the double-blind phase, 75 (27.1%) patients
remained on everolimus, and only 6 (4.3%) patients
remained on placebo.
Treatment Administration and Safety
Median treatment durations were 141 days for everolimus
(range, 19-451 days) and 60 days for placebo (range, 21195 days). At least 1 dose reduction occurred in 7% of
everolimus-treated patients and 1% of placebo-treated
patients. At least 1 treatment interruption occurred in
38% of everolimus-treated patients and 11% of placebotreated patients. Interruptions were because of adverse
events in 35% and 9%, and laboratory test abnormalities
in 3% and 2% of everolimus- and placebo-treated
patients, respectively.
Safety profile was consistent with the second interim
analysis (Table 2).3 By investigator assessment and after a
review of all respiratory adverse events (AEs), 37 (14%)
patients had diagnoses consistent with noninfectious
pneumonitis (grade 1 ¼ 9, grade 2 ¼ 18, grade 3 ¼ 10).
Descriptive statistics showed that median time to onset of
pneumonitis was 108 days (range, 24-257 days). Grade 2
or higher noninfectious pneumonitis management
included dose interruption and/or reduction and corticosteroid use in selected instances. Everolimus was discontinued for noninfectious pneumonitis in 3 and 7 patients,
with grade 2 and 3 toxicity, respectively.
Everolimus exposure was 1.9-fold that of placebo
exposure for patients during the double-blind period; the
risk of infection associated with everolimus treatment was

ongoing everolimus-related grade 3 interstitial lung
disease.
Efficacy Assessment
By central radiology review, median PFS was 4.9 months
(95% confidence interval [CI], 4.0-5.5 months) with
everolimus and 1.9 months (95% CI, 1.8-1.9 months)
with placebo (HR, 0.33; 95% CI, 0.25-0.43; P < .001)
(Fig. 2A). By Kaplan-Meier analysis, the probability of
remaining progression free 10 months after start of treatment was 25% in the everolimus arm. Sensitivity analyses
indicated that benefit was maintained across subgroups
and was consistent with the interim analysis (data not
shown).3
Investigator-assessed data demonstrated a median
PFS of 5.5 months (95% CI, 4.6-5.8 months) with everolimus versus 1.9 months (95% CI, 1.8-2.2 months) with
placebo (HR, 0.32; 95% CI, 0.25-0.41; P < .001) (Fig.
2B).
Before ending the double-blind treatment, 106
(76.2%) of 139 patients who originally were randomized
to placebo and showed progression had crossed over to
everolimus. Median PFS after crossover was 5.1 months
(95% CI, 3.7-7.6) by investigator’s assessment (Fig. 2C).
Best response by central review assessment of stable
disease was achieved in 185 (66.8%) of 277 patients in the
everolimus group versus 45 (32.4%) of 139 in the placebo

Overall Survival
Median OS was 14.8 months in patients randomized to
everolimus versus 14.4 months for patients randomized to
placebo (HR, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.65-1.15; P ¼ .162) (Fig.
6A). Before November 2008, 111 (80%) of 139 patients
allocated to the placebo received open-label everolimus.
Survival results likely were confounded by crossover to
everolimus.
The exploratory rank-preserving structural failure
time analysis estimates the relative survival treatment benefit of everolimus versus placebo. Adjusting for patients
who switched therapy, the survival time if always treated
with everolimus would be 1.9-fold longer (95% CI, 0.58.5) than if never treated with everolimus (ie, when receiving placebo only). The rank-preserving structural failure
time approach was also used to reconstruct the placebo
survival curve as if all patients initially randomized to placebo never switched over to everolimus; the reconstructed

(n ¼ 327), was associated with OS duration (P ¼ .0152;
median, 11.6 vs 16.6 months, respectively). Starting with
the full model (all factors included) and using a significance level of a ¼ .05, factors were selected for the final
multivariate model for PFS and OS.

The Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center risk
model established in previously treated patients is redundant to 3 variables (KPS, corrected calcium, and hemoglobin). Therefore, the multivariate Cox proportional
hazards models for OS were obtained using 2 strategies: 1)
using Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center risk
group (2 dummy variables comparing intermediate risk vs
favorable risk and poor risk vs favorable risk) to investigate
if this risk model is confirmed in the current study; and 2)
using KPS, corrected calcium, and hemoglobin as individual variables to investigate whether these 3 factors have a
prognostic value themselves. For PFS, the same final
model is obtained with both strategies (Table 4). The final
model obtained for OS with Strategy 1 includes the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center risk score. In Strategy 2, all 3 individual variables of Memorial SloanKettering Cancer Center risk score are included in the
final OS model indicating the prognostic relevance of
these factors (Table 4).

Patients received a median of 2 prior antineoplastic medications. Eightynine patients (21%) had received 1 prior medication, 141 (34%) had
received 2 medications, 104 (25%) had received 3 medications, and 82
(20%) had received 4 medications.

For OS, additional models were constructed using
the continuous form rather than the categorized form
where applicable. Assuming a linear effect of all continuous variables, the selected model included nearly the same
variables as shown in Table 3. In addition, the resulting
models included the variables time since initial diagnosis
and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). Further investigation of
continuous covariates suggests a nonlinear effect for LDH
(results not shown).
Overall results confirm the capability of Memorial
Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center risk score to distinguish
different prognosis for OS. The probability of being
alive at 12 months for the favorable, intermediate, and
poor risk groups was 70% (95% CI, 62-79%), 56%

(95% CI, 50-63%), and 26% (95% CI, 15-37%),
respectively (Fig. 6B). In the final multivariate Cox
model, risk was significantly increased for patients with
an intermediate (HR, 1.54; 95% CI, 1.08-2.19) or poor
risk score (HR, 3.38; 95% CI, 2.21-5.16) compared
with patients with a favorable risk score. The analysis
also demonstrated that patients with liver or bone metastases, elevated neutrophils, or prior treatment with
sunitinib had decreased PFS and OS (Table 4), indicating prognostic relevance.

DISCUSSION
Everolimus provided a significant benefit in PFS for patients
with mRCC who progressed on sunitinib and/or sorafenib.
Risk of progression was reduced by 67% for the everolimus
group compared with the placebo group. Median PFS by
central review and investigator assessment was 4.9 and 5.5
months, respectively, compared with 1.9 months for placebo (P < .001). In patients who crossed over to open-label
everolimus after progression by RECIST on placebo, the
median PFS was 5.1 months (95% CI, 3.7-7.6). A clinical
benefit for everolimus in this setting is supported by quality
of life and performance status analyses.
The safety profile of everolimus is acceptable. Grade
3 or 4 AEs were low, and 7% required dose modification.
Thirty-six (13%) of 274 patients receiving everolimus had
treatment discontinued for AEs. Grade 3 noninfectious
pneumonitis occurred in 10 (4%) patients in the everolimus group. Noninfectious pneumonitis is an adverse reaction associated with rapamycin and rapamycin
analogues.11 Awareness of this toxicity and appropriate
diagnostic and medical management is important to optimize patient safety.
The adverse event profile of everolimus differs from
that of VEGFR-TKIs.12,13 This may be an advantage in
patients showing intolerance to sorafenib or sunitinib and
could avoid potential for cumulative toxicity associated with
sequential VEGFR-TKI treatment. For example, hypertension, cardiac events, hypothyroidism, and hand-foot skin
reaction, which may be problematic with VEGFR-TKIs,
are not observed commonly with everolimus.
The OS analysis was likely confounded by crossover
to open-label everolimus for most participants assigned to
placebo. Crossover from placebo to open-label everolimus
was implemented in the trial design based on ethical and
practical considerations. Mature survival results show that
the median OS was 14.8 months for patients treated with
everolimus. A beneficial effect on survival for everolimus

Final models were obtained by backward variable elimination using selection level a ¼ .05 and stratified by randomized
treatment. For Strategy 1, MSKCC risk groups were included using the favorable group as the reference. For Strategy 2,
single factors of the MSKCC score (KPS, corrected calcium, and hemoglobin) were included.

was supported by outcome from an exploratory analysis
that accounted for this crossover effect. According to that
analysis, the estimated median survival for patients on the
placebo arm in the absence of crossover to everolimus is
10.0 months instead of the observed 14.4 months.
Earlier independent prognostic factors established
for patients with mRCC previously treated with cytokines
or chemotherapy,4 including high corrected calcium, low
KPS, and low hemoglobin, were implemented in the
resulting Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center risk
model used for stratification in the RECORD-1 trial.
Because the treatment paradigm has changed, assessment
of prognostic factors in patients with VEGFR-TKI refractory tumors was undertaken.
In developing the Cox proportional hazards model
for this prognostic factor analysis, stratification by
randomized treatment (everolimus vs placebo) was used

4264

to adapt for the treatment effect. All 3 prognostic factors
of the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center score
were independent predictors of OS, and confirmed the
capability of Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center
risk score to separate patients into prognostic subgroups
and the relevance of these factors for the risk score.
Other risk factors, such as presence of liver or bone metastases, or prior treatment with sunitinib, were associated with decreased OS and PFS. These prognostic
factors relate to survival after VEGFR-TKIs and are not
predictive of response to everolimus. Clinical benefit
with everolimus was observed for all patient subsets in
each Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center risk
group4 and regardless of which prior VEGFR-TKI was
received.
The observation that patients who received prior
sunitinib treatment had a poorer prognosis (whereas prior

sorafenib treatment did not) is intriguing. The difference
in median PFS of patients on the placebo arm who were
previously treated with sunitinib or sorafenib but not
both, 1.8 months versus 2.8 months, respectively, suggests
that there may have been a bias in the selection of
VEGFR-TKI or that resistance to sunitinib is associated
with a more aggressive tumor biology.
Optimal sequencing of targeted agents in secondand third-line therapy was not fully addressed in this trial
because of practical considerations. Among patients enrolled, 21% (89 of 416) had prior treatment limited to 1
prior VEGFR-TKI, 53% (219 of 416) had received 1
VEGFR-TKI and at least 1 other prior therapy (most
commonly a cytokine), and 26% (108 of 416) had
received both VEGFR-TKIs with or without additional
prior therapy. As such, everolimus is the only drug to
show a PFS benefit in a randomized phase 3 trial in
patients who progressed on a VEGFR-TKI.
In summary, the benefit and safety of everolimus is
established in patients with mRCC after progression on
VEGFR-TKI therapy. Previously reported Memorial
Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center risk features maintained
prognostic value in this new clinical setting. Ongoing and
future trials with everolimus include clinical studies in
combination with bevacizumab and other targeted agents
in the front-line setting and sequencing studies with sunitinib and everolimus.14,15
