Efﬁcient TGFb-induced epithelial–mesenchymal transition
depends on hyaluronan synthase HAS2
H Porsch, B Bernert, M Mehić, AD Theocharis1, C-H Heldin and P Heldin
Epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a developmental program, which can be adopted by cancer cells to increase their
migration and ability to form metastases. Transforming growth factor b (TGFb) is a well-studied inducer of EMT. We demonstrate
that TGFb potently stimulates hyaluronan synthesis via upregulation of hyaluronan synthase 2 (HAS2) in NMuMG mammary
epithelial cells. This stimulatory effect requires the kinase active type I TGFb receptor and is dependent on Smad signaling and
activation of the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase. Knockdown of HAS2 inhibited the TGFb-induced EMT by about 50%, as
determined by the phase contrast microscopy and immunostaining using the EMT marker ZO-1. Furthermore, real-time PCR
analysis of the EMT markers ﬁbronectin, Snail1 and Zeb1 revealed decreased expressions upon HAS2 suppression, using speciﬁc
small interfering RNA (siRNA) for HAS2. Removal of the extracellular hyaluronan by Streptomyces hyaluronidase or inhibiting the
binding to its cell surface receptor CD44 by blocking antibodies, did not inhibit TGFb-induced EMT. Interestingly, HAS2 suppression
completely abolished the TGFb-induced cell migration, whereas CD44 knockdown did not. These observations suggest that
TGFb-dependent HAS2 expression, but not extracellular hyaluronan, has an important regulatory role in TGFb-induced EMT.

INTRODUCTION
Epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT) of epithelial cells occurs
during embryonic development, and is required for the formation
of tissues and organs.1 EMT also has important roles during other
physiological processes, such as wound healing, and during
pathological conditions including cancer progression.2 During
EMT, cell–cell adhesion is suppressed and epithelial cells acquire a
mesenchymal phenotype exhibiting increased migratory capacity.
Such an alteration in the cellular behavior is dependent on
interactions between cells and the microenvironment.1
A ubiquitous component of the pericellular matrix is hyaluronan,
which is enriched around proliferating and migrating cells in
rapidly remodeling tissues.3 Hyaluronan has key regulatory roles in
tissue homeostasis and possesses signaling properties through its
interaction with cell surface receptors, such as CD44 and RHAMM.4,5
Hyaluronan is synthesized by three related hyaluronan synthases
(designated HAS1, HAS2 and HAS3) encoded by different genes.6–9
The synthases are differentially expressed during mouse
development and possess distinct catalytic activities.10–12 Most
malignant tumors contain elevated amounts of both hyaluronan
and CD44 and many reports have shown that hyaluronan-activated
CD44 promotes tumor progression.13–15
The HAS2 isoform has a key role during embryogenic EMT;
knockout of the mouse HAS2 gene, but not the knockout of
HAS1 and HAS3 genes, leads to abnormal cardiac morphogenesis,
due to failure of cushion cell endothelium to undergo mesenchymal transition, because the hyaluronan-deﬁcient cardiac jelly
fails to mediate hyaluronan–CD44–ErbB2 signaling events.16,17
Experimental induction of the HAS2 isoform in normal epithelial
cells18 and mesothelioma cells19 was found to promote EMT.

The transforming growth factor b (TGFb) superfamily consists of
cytokines with important functions during embryonal development, as well as in inﬂammation and homeostasis of tissues.
Signaling by TGFb is mediated via type I and type II serine/
threonine kinase receptors (TbRI and TbRII, respectively) and leads
to activation of receptor-regulated (R)-Smad proteins, Smad 2 and 3,
which in turn form a complex with the common-mediator (Co)Smad, Smad4. The R-Smad/Co-Smad complexes then translocate
into the nucleus where they act as transcription factors regulating
the transcription of certain genes involved in, for example,
apoptosis, differentiation, proliferation and EMT.20,21 TGFb can also
engage non-Smad-dependent pathways, including activation of
mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways22,23 and the
proteolytic release and nuclear translocation of the intracellular
part of TbRI.24
The levels of both TGFb and hyaluronan are elevated in
advanced cancers and ﬁbrotic conditions.25–27 In this study, we
demonstrate that TGFb induces the HAS2 gene in mammary
epithelial cells, which promotes TGFb-induced EMT.

RESULTS
TGFb-induced synthesis of hyaluronan in mammary epithelial cells
is due to upregulation of HAS2 and depends on Smads and the
kinase activities of TbRI and p38 MAPK
Whereas there is some knowledge about the molecular mechanisms of how extracellular regulatory signals, such as plateletderived growth factor (PDGF)-BB and TGFb, regulate hyaluronan
synthesis in cells of mesenchymal origin,26,28–32 the molecular
mechanisms in epithelial cells are not known. As TGFb mediates

10-fold, whereas those of HAS1 and HAS3 were not changed
(Figure 1c), indicating that HAS2 is responsible for the TGFbmediated potent stimulatory effect on hyaluronan production.
Cotreatment of the cells with the TbRI kinase inhibitor or the p38
MAPK inhibitor decreased the levels of HAS2 mRNA to basal levels,
indicating that the TGFb-dependent induction of HAS2 mRNA is
mediated by both the TbRI kinase, most likely via the Smad
pathway, and the p38 MAPK pathway. Furthermore, transfection
of the cells with siRNA for HAS2 led to a signiﬁcant decrease in
TGFb-mediated hyaluronan synthesis, further supporting the
notion that HAS2 is the major source of the hyaluronan produced
by TGFb stimulated cells (Figure 1d).

Knockdown of HAS2, but not knockdown of CD44, inhibits TGFbinduced EMT
Several studies have presented evidence that HAS2 expression is
closely correlated to increased tumor invasion,35–38 inﬂammation,39 and cellular migration during development.16,40 We,
therefore, examined whether HAS2 is important for TGFbinduced EMT by knocking down HAS2 using speciﬁc siRNA.
TGFb efﬁciently induced EMT in NMuMG cells. Quantiﬁcation of
culture areas, as depicted by phase contrast microscopy, revealed
that after 24 h of TGFb stimulation about 80% of the cells
had acquired a ﬁbroblastic character, and after 48 h about
90% (Figure 2). Interestingly, depletion of HAS2 prevented the
transition of the epithelial cobble-stone phenotype to spindle-like
mesenchymal phenotype by about 50% after 24 h, and was
Hyaluronan production

EMT in NMuMG mammary epithelial cells33,34 and elevated
hyaluronan production via transfection with HAS2 promotes a
mesenchymal and proliferative phenotype,18,19 we investigated
the effect of TGFb on hyaluronan production by NMuMG cells.
Hyaluronan was hardly detectable in unstimulated cell cultures,
whereas TGFb stimulation potently stimulated hyaluronan
synthesis (Figure 1a). The TGFb-mediated hyaluronan synthesis
was nearly abrogated in cells pretreated with the TbRI kinase
inhibitor GW6604 or the p38 MAPK inhibitor SB203580 (Figure 1a).
To evaluate if the Smad signaling pathway is required for TGFbinduced hyaluronan synthesis by NMuMG cells, we transfected
cells with Smad4 small interfering RNA (siRNA), resulting in a
marked inhibition of hyaluronan production compared with
TGFb-stimulated scrambled siRNA transfected cells (Figure 1b).
Moreover, the combination of knockdown of Smad4 and
inhibition of p38 MAPK by SB203580 completely blocked TGFbmediated hyaluronan synthesis (Figure 1b). This indicates that
both Smad-dependent and Smad-independent pathways are
important for the stimulatory effect of TGFb on hyaluronan
production.
In order to investigate which of the three HAS isoforms (HAS1, 2
and 3) were responsible for the dramatic induction of hyaluronan
in response to TGFb, real-time RT–PCR analysis of RNA from nonstimulated NMuMG cells or cells stimulated with TGFb alone or in
combination with inhibitors of the TbRI kinase or the p38 MAPK,
was performed. In non-treated cultures, the expression levels of
the three HAS isoforms were low (Figure 1c). Interestingly, upon
stimulation with TGFb the HAS2 mRNA level were induced about

NMuMG cells were starved and stimulated for 24 h (a and b) or 6 h (c) with TGFb, in the absence or presence of TbRI-kinase inhibitor GW6604,
p38 MAPK inhibitor SB203580 or dimethyl sulfoxide control, or the hyaluronan degrading enzyme Streptomyces hyaluronidase. Cells were

sustained to similar levels 48 h after TGFb stimulation, when the
maximum TGFb-induced EMT was observed (Figure 2).
Given that CD44 has an important role in EMT induced by the
inﬂammatory mediator tumor necrosis factor-a,41 we investigated
its importance for TGFb-mediated EMT. Knockdown of CD44 had
no effect on the TGFb-mediated phenotypic changes of NMuMG
cells (Figure 2).
Immunoﬂuorescence analysis demonstrated that in HAS2expressing NMuMG cells, staining for ZO-1, a component of the
intercellular epithelial cell junctions, decreased after stimulation by
TGFb and the cortical staining of F-actin was altered to stressﬁbers; such changes are seen in mesenchymal cells or in epithelial
cells that have undergone EMT. Interestingly, TGFb stimulation
failed to induce complete EMT in cells in which HAS2 had been
knocked down as demonstrated by the presence of ZO-1 cellular
junctions and the presence of cortical staining of F-actin (Figure 3a).
Supperssion of the hyaluronan receptor CD44, however, did not
inhibit the TGFb-mediated switch of F-actin stress-ﬁbers that are
uniformly organized throughout each cell (Figure 3b).
In order to gain a better understanding of the role of HAS2
during EMT induced by TGFb, we investigated the cellular
distribution of HAS2 and hyaluronan, as active HASs under cellular
stress can be present in intracellular compartments in addition to
the cell membrane.42 HAS2 was detected all over the cell body
and in particular at cell–cell contacts during the EMT process
(Figure 4a). NMuMG cultures undergoing EMT in response to
TGFb stimulation all exhibited both cell-associated (Figure 4b) and
intracellular (Figure 4c) hyaluronan, while untreated cells were
negative. The spindle-like migratory cells had punctuated
hyaluronan-positive membrane protrusions (Figure 4b). In cultures
treated with siRNA for HAS2 and stimulated with TGFb, the cells
that acquired a mesenchymal phenotype were those in which
HAS2 was not successfully silenced, as shown by positive staining
for hyaluronan. In cells depleted of HAS2, hyaluronan staining was
hardly detectable; these cells exhibited an epithelial phenotype
(Figures 4b and c). Thus, exposure of NMuMG cells to TGFb
generates a mesenchymal phenotype associated with HAS2
expression and hyaluronan synthesis. We also investigated
whether the intracellular localization of HAS2 and hyaluronan
promoted autophagy. However, immunoblot analysis with antibodies against the autophagy marker LC3A/B, gave no evidence
& 2013 Macmillan Publishers Limited

that TGFb-induced HAS2 expression affected autophagy
(Supplementary Figure S1).
Fibronectin and the transcription factors Snail1, Zeb1 and Zeb2
are markers of EMT. Therefore, we compared their expression
levels after TGFb stimulation in NMuMG cells expressing HAS2 or
not, using real-time PCR. Stimulation with TGFb induced a twofold
upregulation of ﬁbronectin, Zeb1 and Zeb2 mRNA, and a ﬁvefold
upregulation of Snail1 mRNA levels (Figure 5a). Interestingly,
silencing of HAS2 signiﬁcantly diminished the expression levels of
ﬁbronectin, Snail1 and Zeb1, but had no effect on the Zeb2
(Figure 5a). Notably, the expression levels of TGFb-responsive
genes not known to be involved in EMT, such as Smad7 and PAI1,
did not change upon HAS2 depletion, indicating a certain
selectivity in the effect of HAS2. Western blot analysis, after
different time periods of TGFb stimulation of cells expressing
HAS2 or not, revealed a clear reduction of ﬁbronectin expression
in cells depleted of HAS2, compared with cells transfected
with scrambled siRNA (Figure 5b). We also investigated whether
HAS2 is required for TGFb signaling in general using the CAGAluciferase promoter-reporter assay (Supplementary Figure S2A)
and immunoblotting for pSmad2 (Supplementary Figure S2B); no
effect of knockdown of HAS2 was noticed in either of these
assays. Moreover, no effect on the cleavage of the apoptotic
marker caspase-3 (Supplementary Figure S2C) was seen in TGFbstimulated cells expressing HAS2 or not, giving no support for a
particular role of HAS2 in the apoptotic response. Notably,
knockdown of CD44 had neither any effect on the mRNA
expression levels of ﬁbronectin, Snail1 or Zeb1, nor on the level
of ﬁbronectin protein (Figures 5b,c).
Hyaluronan–CD44 interaction is not required for TGFb-induced
EMT
Next, we investigated whether the powerful production of
hyaluronan by the NMuMG cells in response to TGFb was
important for the ability of TGFb to induce EMT, using
immunoﬂuorescence detection of the tight junction protein
ZO-1 and F-actin. Cotreatment of the cells with TGFb and
KM114 antibodies to block the binding of hyaluronan to CD44,
or Streptomyces hyaluronidase to degrade the newly synthesized
TGFb-induced hyaluronan, did not inhibit the ability of TGFb to

cytometry, we veriﬁed that the binding of ﬂuorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated hyaluronan to cells was completely abolished by

of hyaluronan added exogenously to NMuMG cultures, also
failed to switch the morphology from cobble-stone shaped

was performed with primers for the EMT markers fibronectin, Snail1, Zeb1 and Zeb2, TGFb target genes Smad7 and PAI1 and for HAS2 (a) or

Thus, exogenously added hyaluronan or blocking the binding of
endogenously produced hyaluronan to CD44 did not prevent
TGFb-mediated EMT.
Dominant negative HAS2 does not affect TGFb-induced EMT
The ﬁnding that exogenous hyaluronan did not affect TGFbinduced EMT, suggests that either intracellular hyaluronan is
important or the HAS2 molecule itself in a manner not related to
hyaluronan synthesis. To distinguish between these possibilities,
we took advantage of the K190R mutant HAS2, which is devoid
of hyaluronan synthesizing capacity and acts in a dominant
Oncogene (2013) 4355 – 4365

negative manner by formation of inactive dimeric complexes with
wt HAS2.43 Infections of NMuMG cells with adenovirus vectors
encoding mutant HAS2, wt HAS2 or mock vector were performed
(Figure 6b). Expression of the K190R HAS2 mutant did not
suppress the TGFb-induced EMT, suggesting that the role of HAS2
in TGFb-mediated EMT is independent of its hyaluronan
synthesizing activity (Figure 6b).
Knockdown of HAS2 inhibits TGFb-induced migration of cells

inﬂuences the motility of TGFb-stimulated NMuMG cells, we
measured their migration using a transwell assay. We found that
cells transfected with scrambled siRNA migrated signiﬁcantly
faster during 48 h of TGFb treatment than in starvation medium

alone (Figure 7a). However, when HAS2 was knocked down by
siRNA, TGFb stimulation failed to increase the motility of NMuMG
cells. Importantly, exogenously added hyaluronan could not
signiﬁcantly compensate for the lowered migratory capacity of
the cells, that was induced by knockdown of HAS2. Notably,

epidermal growth factor-induced cell migration was not affected
by HAS2 depletion (Figure 7a), indicating that TGFb-induced cell
migration is speciﬁcally dependent on HAS2 expression.
We also examined whether CD44 expressed by NMuMG cells is
involved in TGFb-induced migration. As shown in Figure 7b, cells
depleted of CD44 exhibited similar migration velocities as cells
expressing CD44. Furthermore, use of KM114 CD44 antibodies to
block the interaction between CD44 and hyaluronan had no effect
on cell motility of CD44-expressing cells.
DISCUSSION
High expression of TGFb ligands44,45 and elevated levels of
hyaluronan15,46 have been associated with breast cancer
progression. We have demonstrated here that stimulation of
immortalized mammary epithelial cells, NMuMG, with TGFb
potently induces both HAS2 expression and EMT, and that
silencing of HAS2 suppresses the TGFb-induced EMT.
Whereas our ﬁndings thus support the notion that HAS2
is important for TGFb-induced EMT, addition of exogenous
hyaluronan or removal of secreted endogenously synthesized
hyaluronan by Streptomyces hyaluronidase, did not affect EMT.
Moreover, blocking or downregulating the hyaluronan receptor
Oncogene (2013) 4355 – 4365

CD44 did not either affect TGFb-induced EMT. It is unlikely that the
other hyaluronan receptor RHAMM acted on behalf of CD44 as
RHAMM was found not to be expressed, or expressed at very low
levels, in NMuMG cultures, whereas RHAMM was strongly
expressed in mouse embryonic ﬁbroblasts used as a positive
control, as determined by immunoblotting and immunoﬂuorescence staining (data not shown). Thus, the hyaluronan produced
by TGFb-induced HAS2 may have an intracellular function
important for EMT. The presence of intracellular hyaluronan has
been demonstrated.47–50 Alternatively, the HAS2 molecule has
another function, not related to hyaluronan production, which is
important for TGFb-induced EMT. Our ﬁnding that overexpression
of a dominant negative mutant of HAS2 did not affect TGFbinduced EMT, suggests that the involvement of HAS2 is not
related to its enzymatic activity.
Recent data have implicated HAS2 in mechanisms involved in
an invasive breast cancer phenotype.36–38 Estrogen/progesterone
negative aggressive breast cancer cell lines, MDA-MB-231 and HS578T, exhibit high hyaluronan synthesizing capacity whereas the
non-aggressive hormone receptor positive cells, MCF-7 and Zr-75-1,
synthesize minute amounts of hyaluronan.51 HAS2 expression is
positively correlated with the incidence of bone metastasis of
breast cancer cells and is implicated in the cooperation with
stromal cells and the paracrine production of growth factors.38
In addition, HAS2 is among the 0.3% highly expressed genes that
confer increased invasiveness of pancreatic cancer cells.35
Moreover, ectopic expression of HAS2 results in EMT and
acquisition of a malignant migratory phenotype of non-invasive
epithelial cells.18,19 The mechanism that triggers the expression of
HAS2 in certain cancers, but not HAS1 and HAS3 expression,
remains to be elucidated. Our present study supports the
possibility that TGFb signaling, which is enhanced during the
transition of low-grade to high-grade breast cancer, contributes to
the increased HAS2 activity and increased hyaluronan levels in
advanced cancers.
During TGFb-induced EMT, a group of transcription factors is
upregulated, including Snail1, Slug, Twist, ZEB1 and ZEB2, as well
as the matrix molecule ﬁbronectin. The transcription factors are
expressed at much higher levels in the CD44 þ /CD24  breast
cancer stem cell population,52 which has self-renewal properties
and migratory capacity, and expresses HAS2.38 Our data clearly
show that suppression of HAS2 results in lowered expression of
ﬁbronectin, Snail1 and ZEB1, but not ZEB2, during TGFb-induced
EMT (Figure 5a). Interestingly, the extracellular matrix of normal
mammary tissue is soft and contains only low amount of
ﬁbronectin. However, increased synthesis of ﬁbronectin, resulting
in stiffer tissue, is seen in certain cancers.53
Our observations may have implication for disease management during breast cancer progression. As efﬁcient TGFb-induced
EMT requires HAS2 expression, strategies to inhibit HAS2-induced
hyaluronan production, or its expression, for example, with
4-methylumbelliferone, might prevent or delay invasiveness of
breast cancer. The expression of HAS2 is known to be dependent
on Smad and CREB-binding elements in the 50 -promoter region of
HAS2.54 Our results provide evidence that TGFb mediates its
stimulatory effects on HAS2 induction both in a Smad-dependent
and Smad-independent manner. Currently, experiments are in
progress to elucidate the precise regulatory mechanisms through
which TGFb modulate HAS2 expression in mammary epithelial
cells of different malignant phenotypes.

stimulation, cells were starved for 24 h in Dulbecco’s modiﬁed Eagle’s
medium supplemented with 2% FBS. When cells were incubated with
TGFb (TGFb-1, Peprotech, Peprotech Nordic, Stockholm, Sweden, 1 ng/ml)
and inhibitors (TbRI kinase inhibitor GW6604, American Customs Chemicals
Corp, San Diego, CA, USA, 6 mM; p38 MAPK inhibitor SB203580, Calbiochem,
Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany, 10 mM) or CD44-blocking antibodies
KM114 (BD Biosciences, BD AB, Stockholm, Sweden, 2.5 mg/ml), the
inhibitors and antibodies were pre-incubated with the cells for 1 h before
the addition of TGFb. For autophagy experiments, some cells were
stimulated with 50 mM chloroquine (Sigma, Sigma-Aldrich Sweden AB,
Stockholm, Sweden) for 12 h before lysis.

siRNA transfection, adenoviral infection and gene reporter assay
Cells were transiently transfected with scrambled siRNA, HAS2 siRNA
(20 nM, 72 h before stimulation), Smad4 siRNA (50 nM, 48 h before
stimulation), or CD44 siRNA (20 nM, 72 h before stimulation), all ONTARGETplus SMARTpool from Dharmacon (Thermo Fischer scientiﬁc,
Gothenburg, Sweden), using SilentFECT transfection reagent (Biorad,
Biorad laboratories AB, Sundbyberg, Sweden) according to the instructions
by the manufacturer.
Green ﬂuorescent adenoviruses expressing wild-type FLAG-mHAS2 or
K190R mutant FLAG-mHAS2, which is devoid of hyaluronan synthesizing
capacity,43 were made using AdenoX-Adenoviral System 3 (Clontech,
Bionordica Sweden AB, Stockholm, Sweden) and transient infections of
cells were performed according to the manufactureŕs protocol. For gene
reporter assays, cells were infected with adenoviruses expressing LacZ and
CAGA9 assays were carried out using the Fireﬂy luciferase assay kit (Biotium,
VWR International AB, Stockholm, Sweden), as previously described.55

Hyaluronan enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay-like assay
Cells (200 000/well or 30 000 cells/well for siRNA experiments), were
seeded in six-well plates and grown in Dulbecco’s modiﬁed Eagle’s
medium/10% FBS; after starvation for 24 h cells were stimulated with
1 ng/ml TGFb in the absence or presence of inhibitors for another 24 h, as
described above. Conditioned media were collected and the hyaluronan
content was quantiﬁed by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay-like
assay, as previously described.29 This assay is based on the speciﬁc binding
of hyaluronan molecules in the samples to immobilized G1 global domain
of aggrecan.

Real-time PCR
Total RNA was extracted from unstimulated or stimulated cells using the
RNeasy Mini Kit (QIAGEN, Qiagen Nordic, Sollentuna, Sweden) according to
the manufacturer’s instructions. One microgram of RNA was reversely
transcribed to complementary DNA using iScript complementary DNA
synthesis Kit (Biorad). Real-time PCR (95 1C, 2 min; 40  (95 1C, 10 s; 55 1C,
30 s)) was carried out using iQ SYBR Green Supermix (Biorad) and primers

Microscopy
Cells seeded on coverslips in six-well plates were transfected with 20 nM of
scrambled siRNA, or siRNA for HAS2 or CD44, followed by starvation and
stimulation with TGFb. Furthermore, cells were stimulated with 250 mg/ml
hyaluronan alone or with 1 ng/ml TGFb in the absence or presence of the
CD44-blocking antibody KM114 (2.5 mg/ml) or control IgG (2.5 mg/ml), or
2 units/ml of Streptomyces hyaluronidase (Sigma). Cells were ﬁxed in 3%
paraformaldehyde for 15–30 min, permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 for
10 min (except samples for determination of extracellular hyaluronan) and
blocked in 5% FBS, 0.1 M glycine overnight at 4 1C. For visualization of
intracellular hyaluronan, cells were treated with 10 U/ml Streptomyces
hyaluronidase for 1 h at 37 1C and washed extensively before permeabilization. Then, cells were stained with tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate (TRITC)-phalloidin (0.5 mg/ml, Invitrogen) or antibodies against ZO-1
(Invitrogen; 1:200 dilution) or HAS2 (Santa cruz biotechnologies, AH
Diagnostics, Stockholm, Sweden; 1:200 dilution), or with biotinylated G1
probe for hyaluronan detection, followed by Alexa Fluor 488-labeled goat
anti-mouse or anti-rabbit secondary antibodies or Alexa-Fluor-488Streptavidin-conjugate (all from Molecular Probes, Life Technologies
Europe BV; 1:1000 dilution). Nuclei were counterstained with DAPI and
the slides were mounted with ProLong Gold Antifade reagent (Invitrogen).
Photographs were taken with a Zeiss Axioplan 2 immunoﬂuorescence
microscope (Carl Zeiss AB, Stockholm, Sweden).
Unstimulated or TGFb-stimulated cells transfected with scrambled
siRNA, or siRNA for HAS2 or CD44, as described above, were observed
with a phase contrast Zeiss Axiovision 40 microscope (Carl Zeiss).
Photographs were taken and the number of cells with epithelial (cobblestone shaped and Carl Zeiss AB growing in sheets) or mesenchymal
(elongated and spread) morphology per vision ﬁeld was measured; B8
vision ﬁelds per treatment were analyzed for the fraction of epithelial cells.

Transwell migration assay
The migratory properties of cells transfected with siRNA against HAS2,
CD44 or a scrambled sequence, after stimulation or not with TGFb for 24 h,
were evaluated using Transwell chambers (24-well plate, 8 mm pore size,
BD Biosciences) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. As chemotactic stimuli in the bottom chamber were used 10% FBS, 1 ng/ml TGFb,
250 mg/ml hyaluronan or 10 ng/ml epidermal growth factor. In some
experiments, CD44 was blocked by pre-incubating the cells with KM114
antibodies. After 24 h, the inserts were ﬁxed in 2.5% glutaraldehyde and
stained with Giemsa. Bright-ﬁeld photographs were taken using a Zeiss
Axiovision 40 microscope and the number of migrating cells was counted.

Protein extraction, SDS–polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and
immunoblotting
Cells were lysed in 20 mM Tris pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 10 mM EDTA, 0.5%
Triton X-100, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, supplemented with protease and
phosphatase inhibitors (0.5 mg/ml Pefabloc, Roche, Roche diagnostics
Scandinavia AB, Stockholm, Sweden, 10 mM Leupeptin, Sigma, Sigma-Aldrich
Sweden AB, 1 mM Pepstatin Sigma, Sigma-Aldrich Sweden AB, 100 KIU/ml
Aprotinin, Calbiochem, Merck KGaA and 1 mM sodium orthovanadate).
After 30 min of incubation with occasional vortexing and centrifugation
(10 000 g, 10 min, 4 1C), supernatants were processed for SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (8% polyacrylamide gels) followed by immunoblotting. After protein transfer to Hybond C Extra nitrocellulose
membranes (Amersham Biosciences, GE Healthcare, Uppsala, Sweden)
and blocking (5% milk in tris buffered saline (TBS), 0.1% Tween 20),
membranes were incubated with antibodies against ﬁbronectin or b-actin
(both from Sigma; 1:10 000 dilution), phospho-Smad2 (homemade),
cleaved caspase-3 or LC3A/B (both from Cell signaling Technology,
BioNordika Sweden AB, Stockholm, Sweden; 1 : 1000 dilution) at 4 1C
overnight, followed by horseradish peroxide-conjugated secondary antibodies (1 : 10 000 dilution; Invitrogen); immunocomplexes were thereafter
detected by chemoluminescence.

Statistical analysis
Data from three separate experiments was analyzed by paired Student’s
t-test. Errors are in s.d. and a result was considered statistically signiﬁcant
when the P-value was below 0.05.
