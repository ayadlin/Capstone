BACKGROUND: Patients with recurrent/refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma (CLL)
often have chemotherapy-resistant disease, resulting in poor prognosis. The aim of this study was to learn if inhibition
of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) would produce tumor responses. METHODS: This was a phase 2
study of oral single-agent everolimus (10 mg/day) for recurrent/refractory indolent lymphoid malignancies including
CLL. RESULTS: Four of 22 patients with CLL (18%; 95% confidence interval, 5%-40%) achieved a partial remission to
therapy. An unanticipated finding in this study was an increase in absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) associated with
a decrease in lymphadenopathy in 8 (36%) patients. ALC increased a median of 4.8-fold (range, 1.9- to 25.1-fold), and
the clinically measurable lymphadenopathy decreased a median of 75.5% (range, 38%-93%) compared with baseline
measurements. CONCLUSIONS: Everolimus has modest antitumor activity against CLL and can mobilize malignant
cells from nodal masses into the peripheral circulation in a subset of CLL patients. Because CLL cells in lymphatic tissue and bone marrow can be more resistant to therapy than circulating CLL cells, the ability of everolimus to mobilize

Chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma (CLL) is one of the most common lymphoid malignancies in the United States, with an estimated incidence of 20,000 new diagnoses per year and a prevalence of
>100,000.1 There is now highly effective initial therapy for previously untreated, advanced stage CLL, with response rates
of >90%, complete responses (CRs) in >40% of patients, and median response durations >3 years.2,3 In contrast, outcome remains poor for patients with recurrent or treatment-refractory CLL.4,5 More effective therapies for this group of
patients are needed.
Rapamycin (sirolimus) is a highly specific inhibitor of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR).6 mTOR is a
multifunctional signal transduction kinase with a critical role in the signal transduction pathway linking growth stimuli
with cell cycle progression.7 Rapamycin can inhibit cell growth and proliferation, induce apoptosis in some tumor cell
lines, and inhibit tumor cell motility by impairing cell polarization and protrusion.8 Rapamycin has been demonstrated to
induce apoptosis in CLL cells in vitro, although the required concentration was higher than is achievable in vivo, and the
clinical significance of this finding remains uncertain.8 There are now 2 rapamycin analogs, temsirolimus and everolimus,

which are currently approved by the US Food and Drug
Administration for relapsed renal cancer. Temsirolimus
also has demonstrated effectiveness in the treatment of
relapsed/refractory mantle cell lymphoma.9,10
Although a major pathogenic mechanism in development of CLL is defective apoptosis, recent research has
shown that CLL is a dynamic malignancy, with cellular
turnover ranging between 0.1% and 1% per day.11 The
CLL tumor burden has 2 distinct cellular populations, a
proliferative compartment morphologically characterized
by larger cells in the proliferation centers of the lymphoid
tissues and bone marrow, and the kinetically inactive circulating cells.12,13 A targeted inhibitor of cell division such as
everolimus could be effective in the treatment of CLL,
especially in patients with recurrent/refractory disease, who
often have more rapid cellular turnover.14 This hypothesis
is supported by data from in vitro studies that showed that
rapamycin and everolimus induce cell cycle arrest in activated CLL cells without inducing apoptosis.12,15,16 In
addition, proliferation of CLL cells requires stromal support mediated through cytokines and adhesion molecules
(eg, integrins),17 and many of these supportive signals are
transmitted by the PI3K and Akt pathways involving
mTOR.13 Thus, there is a sound biological rationale for
testing everolimus as a treatment for CLL.
We have recently completed a phase 2 clinical trial
using everolimus to treat patients with recurrent/refractory indolent lymphoid malignancies that included 22
patients with CLL. In this paper, we report the results of
treatment of the CLL patients. The most striking finding
was the increase in absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) and
concomitant decrease in the lymph node size observed in
8 of these patients.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
This was a 2-stage, phase 2 study conducted to assess
response in previously treated patients with lymphoid
malignancies after treatment with single-agent everolimus. The study was conducted through the Mayo Clinic
Cancer Center and approved by the Mayo Clinic Institutional Review Board according to the principles of the
Helsinki Declaration, and all patients were provided written informed consent. Patients with CLL were eligible for
this trial if they met the CLL diagnostic criteria defined by
the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Working Group criteria of 199618 or the criteria for the small lymphocytic
lymphoma (SLL) variant defined by the World Health
Organization,19 had previously received therapy for their
lymphoid malignancy, and had recurrent disease or were

2202

refractory to their last treatment. The recurrence was
required to be biopsy proven within 6 months before
enrollment. There was no limit on the number of prior
therapies. Patients were required to be 18 years old, and
in addition to meeting diagnostic criteria, were also
required to have pretreatment measurable disease by computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging scanning, with at least 1 lesion that had a single greatest
dimension of >2 cm, or an ALC >5  109/L. Patients
were to have a life expectancy of 3 months; Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0, 1, or
2; absolute neutrophil count (ANC) 1  109/L; platelet
count 75  109/L; hemoglobin 8 g/dL; serum creatinine 2 the upper normal limit (UNL); serum bilirubin
2 UNL (if total bilirubin was >2 UNL, then a
direct bilirubin of <1.5 UNL was acceptable); and
aspartate aminotransferase 3 ULN (5 ULN if liver
involvement was present). Patients could not have known
human immunodeficiency virus infection.
Patients were treated with 10 mg of everolimus by
mouth in the fasting state every day, and 4 weeks of treatment was considered 1 cycle. A complete blood count was
performed weekly during the first cycle and then before
each subsequent cycle. If the platelet count was 40 
109/L, ANC was 1  109/L, and there were no grade 3
or 4 nonhematological toxicities (NCI Common Toxicity
Criteria version 3.0), the full dose of everolimus was prescribed for the next cycle. Patients who did not meet
the retreatment criteria had treatment held until recovery
followed by a stepwise dose modification to 5 mg daily,
5 mg every other day, and 5 mg every third day. Patients
did not receive prophylactic white blood cell growth factors
to maintain dosing, but could receive them at physician discretion if neutropenia developed. Erythropoietin treatment
for anemia was also permitted at physician discretion.
Patients were restaged for tumor response after 2
and 6 cycles using the NCI Working Group 1996 criteria18 for those with an ALC >5  109/L and the International Workshop Criteria for patients who had never had
an ALC >5  109/L (SLL variant).20 The maximum
decrease in the clinically measurable lymphadenopathy
was determined from the sum of the products of the largest lymph node dimensions on clinical examination of the
largest cervical, axillary, and inguinal lymph nodes.18
Patients who had disease progression or unacceptable toxicity at any time went off study. Patients with stable disease after 6 cycles continued treatment at their physician’s
discretion. Patients who had a CR after Cycle 6 were to
receive 2 cycles past CR and then could discontinue

at their physician’s discretion. Patients with a partial
response (PR) after 6 cycles of therapy continued on treatment until progression if tolerated.

Statistical Analysis
This phase 2 study used a 2-stage Simon design to assess
the efficacy and tolerability of everolimus in patients with
indolent lymphoid malignancies. Thirty-seven evaluable
patients were required to test the null hypothesis that the
true response rate for this regimen is at most 20% versus
the alternative hypothesis that the true response rate is 40%
or greater. The study had 90% power, with a 9% type I
error rate. Patients were considered evaluable for response
if they were eligible and received treatment. The response
rate was estimated by the number of responses divided by
the number of evaluable patients. A 95% binomial confidence interval for the true response rate was calculated.
This report is limited to the 22 CLL patients enrolled in
the study because of the unique characteristics of the
response of these patients to treatment with everolimus.
Duration of response was defined for patients who
achieved a response as the time from the date a response
was first documented until the earliest date progression was
documented. Progression-free survival (PFS) was defined
for all patients as the time from the date of registration until
the date of progression or death from any cause. Overall
survival (OS) was defined as the time from the date of registration until the date of death from any cause. The distributions of time to event endpoints were estimated using the
Kaplan-Meier method, and patients who were event-free
were censored on the date of last follow-up.
Adverse events were graded using the NCI Common
Toxicity Criteria (version 3.0). Toxicity was defined as an
adverse event classified as being possibly, probably, or definitely related to study treatment.

RESULTS
Patient Characteristics
Twenty-two patients with CLL (10 with the SLL variant)
were enrolled in this study between January 2006 and July
2008 (Table 1). All patients were eligible and evaluable
for response. The median time from diagnosis of CLL to
registration was 7 years (range, 2-22 years).
Response to Treatment
Four patients (18%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 5%40%) achieved a PR to therapy at 1.8, 6.4, 9.1, and 14.1

11.0, 19.8, and 8.9þ months, respectively. Seventeen
patients had disease progression, and 15 patients have
died. Causes of death were disease progression (n ¼ 11),
infection possibly attributable to treatment as detailed
below (n ¼ 2), infection unrelated to treatment (n ¼ 1),
and unknown (n ¼ 1). The median follow-up for patients
still alive was 17 months (range, 6-30 months), the median OS was 10.5 months (95% CI, 4.9-20.7), and the
median PFS was 5.1 months (95% CI, 2.3-8.3).
Increasing ALC Associated With Decreasing
Lymph Node Size
An unanticipated and potentially important finding
of this study was the increase in ALC associated with
a decrease in lymphadenopathy in 8 (36%) patients
(Fig. 1). This lymphocyte mobilization was observed in
6 (66%) of the 9 patients with an ALC >5  109/L at
baseline and 2 (15%) of the 13 patients with an ALC 5
 109/L at baseline. Among the 8 patients in whom this
phenomenon was observed, all had measurable lymphadenopathy at baseline, and in 6 (75%) at least 1 lymph node
was 5 cm in its greatest dimension. ALC increased from

a median baseline level of 7.1  109/L (range, 0.7-101.2
 109/L) to 18.3  109/L (range, 1.2-415.3  109/L) at
the first post-treatment ALC (median interval from start
of therapy, 29 days; range, 7-49 days) (Fig. 2). Patients
achieved a median 76% (range, 38%-93%) decrease in
clinically measurable lymph node size compared with
baseline. This was associated with a median 4.8-fold
(range, 1.9- to 25.1-fold) increase in ALC compared with
baseline (median, 38.4  109/L; range, 3.8-415.3  109/
L), which occurred at a median interval of 43 days (range,
29-242 days) from the start of therapy. Of the 8 patients
with lymphocyte mobilization, 2 achieved a clinical PR
(both had SLL), 4 had clinically stable disease, 1 had dis-

2204

ease progression, and 1 was removed from the study
because of an adverse event before clinical response could
be evaluated.
Lymphocyte mobilization was not an anticipated
finding in this study, and the mechanism of this response
was not studied. In 1 patient with lymphocyte mobilization, a bone marrow (BM) examination was performed
on Day 6 of everolimus treatment because of concern
about the patient’s clinical status. Although the results of
the BM biopsy showed minimal change compared with
baseline, the majority of the BM and circulating lymphocytes had the same morphological appearance as CLL
cells. This finding suggests that the increase in circulating
lymphocytes was caused by an increase in CLL cells. No
confirmatory immunophenotyping studies were done on
the circulating lymphocytes.
Toxicity and Tolerability
Patients received a median of 2 months (range, 1 week to
29 months) and a median of 2 cycles (range, 1-18 cycles)
of treatment. Twenty patients have gone off treatment, 13
because of disease progression, 3 because of toxicity (1
patient with grade 2 pancreatitis, 1 with grade 3 fatigue, 1
with cytopenia), 2 died on-study (1 patient because of sepsis possibly related to treatment, 1 from disease progression), and 2 refused further therapy without response or
progression. Nine patients experienced dose delays on 12
cycles of therapy because of hematological adverse events
(10 cycles), hospitalization (1 cycle), and a delay in getting
laboratory results (1 cycle). Nine patients experienced
dose reductions on 11 cycles because of hematological
adverse events (9 cycles), mucositis (1 cycle), and infection
(1 cycle).
Fifteen patients experienced a grade 3 or higher hematologic adverse event (7 grade 3, 8 grade 4), and 9
patients experienced a grade 3 or higher nonhematologic
adverse event (5 grade 3, 1 grade 4, 3 grade 5). Focusing
on adverse events at least possibly attributable to the study
therapy (Table 2), 14 patients experienced a grade 3 or
higher hematologic toxicity (6 grade 3, 8 grade 4), and 7
patients experienced a grade 3 or higher nonhematologic
toxicity (5 grade 3, 2 grade 5). Grade 3 or 4 anemia, neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia occurred in 23%, 32%,
and 50% of patients, respectively. The most common
grade 3 nonhematologic toxicities were pneumonia (n ¼
2) and hypertriglyceridemia (n ¼ 2). One patient, who
died of infection with positive blood cultures, had grade 4
adult respiratory distress syndrome complicating sepsis
and grade 3 neutropenia; both complications were

DISCUSSION
Treatment of patients with recurrent/refractory CLL
using single-agent everolimus showed biological activity,
with 18% of patients achieving a PR. An additional finding was that 36% of patients had an unexpected and
marked increase in ALC with a concomitant decease in
lymph node size. These results show that everolimus can
be clinically active in some patients with recurrent/refractory CLL, and suggest that mTOR inhibition can mobilize CLL cells from tissue sites into the circulation. Both
of these findings could have important implications for
the treatment of CLL.
Patients with recurrent/refractory CLL, especially
those with purine analogue refractory disease or loss of
p53 function because of gene deletions or mutations, have
a poor prognosis.4 The 18% PR rate achieved with everolimus therapy in this study, although modest, warrants
further study in light of the heavily pretreated nature of
the patient population, the fact that this study used singleagent everolimus, and that tumor cell mobilization was
observed. In addition, the modest response rate needs to
Cancer

May 1, 2010

be interpreted in the context of the NCI Working Group
1996 criteria that requires a minimum 50% decrease in
ALC to qualify for a response to treatment. The increase
in ALC observed in 6 of the patients with CLL who had a
decrease in adenopathy prevents them from being considered responsive to treatment. This could have resulted in
an underestimation of the efficacy of single-agent everolimus therapy in this group of patients.
The mobilization effect observed could be especially
useful for selecting drugs to be tested in combination with
everolimus. In the only previously published report of the
treatment of patients with CLL using everolimus,21 the
pilot trial was stopped after treatment of only 7 patients
because of infectious complications. Of the treated
patients, 1 achieved a PR, and 3 had stable disease.
Although not commented on by the authors, review of the
published data shows that 6 of the 7 patients appear to
have had progressive lymphocytosis in response to initiation of therapy with everolimus at a dose of 5 mg/day;
there was no information on the effect of everolimus on
lymphadenopathy.
The stromal microenvironment of the lymphoid tissues and bone marrow provides critical support for CLL
cell proliferation, survival, and resistance to therapeutic
drugs.22 Preclinical data suggest that disruption of the

2205

Original Article

interaction between CLL cells and stroma can decrease
drug resistance in CLL cells.17 In addition, the therapeutic
unconjugated monoclonal antibodies alemtuzumab and
rituximab, which are highly effective against circulating
CLL cells, have limited efficacy against bulky adenopathy
and splenomegaly.23,24 Mobilization of CLL cells from
tissue into the circulation is likely to remove these CLL
cells from the protective stromal microenvironment and
enhance the cytotoxicity of drugs such as alemtuzumab,
which have the additional advantage of being effective in
patients with purine analogue-refractory CLL with defective p53 function.25,26 Combinations of everolimus and
drugs such as alemtuzumab could potentially be synergistic
in patients with bulky adenopathy, resulting in improved
treatment outcomes.
Everolimus is an immunosuppressive drug that
can also be myelosuppressive. Thus, it was not surprising that infections were observed in this study of CLL
patients already immunocompromised by their underlying disease and prior therapy. Indeed, infection resulted
in 2 deaths. Neutropenia could have contributed to the
risk of infection, but thrombocytopenia was not associated with bleeding complications. The other grade 3-4
toxicities responded well to appropriate management.
These data suggest that CLL patients treated with everolimus in the future will likely benefit from prophylaxis
and surveillance for opportunistic infections, and that
combination therapies including everolimus should be
designed to minimize marrow toxicity in this patient
population.
mTOR has been shown to be an integral component
of important signaling pathways in CLL cells, and inhibition of these pathways by everolimus could be expected to
decrease cell growth and be cytotoxic.12,15,16 In contrast,
the mechanism by which everolimus causes CLL cell mobilization into the circulation is unknown, and will need
to be investigated to develop interventions to optimize
this effect. These investigations were not performed in
this study, because the finding was unexpected. The extent
of mobilization and the concomitant decrease in the clinically detectable lymphadenopathy was only fully appreciated at the time of analysis of the study results. The study
was designed to evaluate ALC each cycle and measurable
lymph nodes after Cycles 2 and 6 and every 3 cycles thereafter. The study was not designed to measure or record
ALC more frequently; therefore, the kinetics and magnitude of the CLL cell mobilization could actually have
been underestimated in this study population. Future
studies should be designed to more frequently measure

2206

the mobilization effect of everolimus in CLL patients,
study the cell surface immunophenotype of the mobilized
cells, and determine whether the CLL cells mobilized into
the circulation are as sensitive to monoclonal antibodymediated cytotoxicity as cells collected before treatment
with everolimus.
In conclusion, this study shows that everolimus could
be a valuable drug for use in combination therapy for CLL
patients. Further understanding of the mechanism of action
of everolimus in CLL will be very useful in designing trials
to improve therapy for this incurable disease.
