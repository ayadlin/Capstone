ABSTRACT
Loss of the tumor suppressor phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on
chromosome 10 (PTEN) is a prerequisite for tumor cell-specific expression of
vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR)-2 in glioblastoma defining a
subgroup prone to develop evasive resistance towards antiangiogenic treatments.
Immunohistochemical analysis of human tumor tissues showed VEGFR-2 expression
in glioma cells in 19% of specimens examined, mainly in the infiltration zone.
Glioma cell VEGFR-2 positivity was restricted to PTEN-deficient tumor specimens.
PTEN overexpression reduced VEGFR-2 expression in vitro, as well as knock-down
of raptor or rictor. Genetic interference with VEGFR-2 revealed proproliferative,
antiinvasive and chemoprotective functions for VEGFR-2 in glioma cells. VEGFR-2dependent cellular effects were concomitant with activation of ’kappa-light-chainenhancer’ of activated B-cells, protein kinase B, and N-myc downstream regulated
gene 1. Two-photon in vivo microscopy revealed that expression of VEGFR-2 in
glioma cells hampers antiangiogenesis. Bevacizumab induces a proinvasive response
in VEGFR-2-positive glioma cells. Patients with PTEN-negative glioblastomas had
a shorter survival after initiation of bevacizumab therapy compared with PTENpositive glioblastomas. Conclusively, expression of VEGFR-2 in glioma cells indicates
an aggressive glioblastoma subgroup developing early resistance to temozolomide
or bevacizumab. Loss of PTEN may serve as a biomarker identifying those tumors
upfront by routine neuropathological methods.

INTRODUCTION

RESULTS

Agents targeting the vascular endothelial growth
factor (VEGF)/VEGF receptor (VEGFR)-2 axis in
glioblastoma have widely been tested [1]. However,
recent phase III trials in newly diagnosed glioblastoma
demonstrated a failure of the monoclonal anti-VEGFdirected antibody bevacizumab (BEV) to extend overall
survival (OS) when combined with chemoradiation,
despite benefits in progression-free survival (PFS)
and quality of life [2, 3]. One potential reason for the
lack of an overall survival benefit is that angiogenesis
inhibitors, by impairment of tumor angiogenesis, may
eventually have detrimental effects, including induction
of enhanced tumor cell invasion into surrounding tissue
in yet to be defined subgroups [4–6]. In clinical series,
upon progression on BEV, glioblastoma can display a
more infiltrative pattern of recurrence [7]. Yet, a recent
study from our own group argued that the promotion
of distant tumor growth or a gliomatosis-like growth
phenotype at recurrence is relevant at best in a minority
of patients [8]. An analysis from the AVAglio trial also
argues against a specific propensity of BEV to induce
diffuse or infiltrative growth, but identified a subgroup
of patients showing this tumor growth behavior [9].
Hence, molecular profiling allowing an identification of
subgroups of tumors that are at increased risk to develop
early resistance towards antiangiogenic treatments
remains an unmet need.
According to the molecular subtypes of Phillips
et al. loss of the phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted
on chromosome 10 (PTEN) and expression of VEGFR-2
are features of the mesenchymal glioblastoma phenotype
[10]. Mutations or deletions in the PTEN gene commonly
lead to activation of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/
protein kinase B (AKT/PKB)/mammalian target of
rapamycin (mTOR) signaling network and have previously
been reported to be associated with reduced survival of
glioma patients [11]. Recently, a molecular mechanism
was proposed by which ablation of the VEGF/VEGFR-2
signaling cascade increases activity of the hepatocyte
growth factor (HGF) receptor MET through a MET/
VEGFR-2 heterocomplex and thus promotes tumor cell
invasion in glioblastoma [6], although clinical evidence for
an effect of MET inhibition in patients with glioblastoma
is lacking. Furthermore, expression of VEGFR-2 by tumor
cells in addition to its constitutive presence on endothelial
cells in glioblastoma has been controversial, though there
has been increasing evidence for a restricted expression of
VEGFR-2 in a subset of tumor cells [12–16].
The goal of the present work was to validate the
expression of VEGFR-2 in glioblastoma cells and tissues
with respect to the PTEN status and to characterize
VEGFR-2-specific functions in glioma cells focusing on
clinically relevant therapeutic modalities.

A subgroup of glioblastoma exhibits tumor cell
expression of VEGFR-2, predominantly in the
infiltration zone

www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Aiming to assess the incidence of tumoral VEGFR-2
expression, we evaluated the expression pattern of
VEGFR-2 in a total of 106 patient-derived glioblastoma
specimens. As expected, endothelial cells in all of these
tumor tissues exhibited strong immunoreactivity for
VEGFR-2. Yet, in 20 of the 106 specimens (19%),
VEGFR-2 expression was additionally found to be
confined to tumor cells (Figure 1A; Figure S1A, S1B).
To verify expression of VEGFR-2 specifically on glioma
cells, we used a co-staining with the tumor cell-specific
IDH1R132H antibody (Figure 1B). Moreover, subgroup
analysis of 40 specimens allowing a distinct differentiation
between tumor core (n = 34) and infiltration zone (n = 6)
disclosed that VEGFR-2-positive glioblastoma cells were
more frequently found in the infiltration zone. Three of the
six glioblastoma specimens (50%) of which the infiltration
zones were assessable showed VEGFR-2 expression
only there, whereas from the other 34 tumors only two
demonstrated VEGFR-2 expression in the tumor core
(5.9%, p = 0.018, exact Fisher test; Figure 1C). Taken
together, next to its known vessel-bound expression,
VEGFR-2 is additionally expressed by glioblastoma cells,
preferentially in the tumor infiltration zone.

Loss of PTEN and activated PI3K/AKT/
mTOR signaling are required for expression of
VEGFR-2 in glioblastoma cells
Two of eight glioma cell lines and one of two GIC
with known PTEN status expressed VEGFR-2 mRNA
and protein (Figure 1D,1E). Expression data were
confirmed by immunofluorescence and flow cytometry
(Figure S2A, S2B). A comparison between VEGFR-2
expression and PTEN status showed expression for
VEGFR-2 only in cells with deficiency of PTEN,
indicating a mutually exclusive expression pattern
for VEGFR-2 and PTEN in glioma cell lines and GIC
cultures (Table S1). Treatment of VEGFR-2-positive LN308 glioma cells with exogenous VEGF (50 ng/ml) led
to increased phosphorylation of VEGFR-2, p90RSK and
AKT, confirming active VEGFR-2 signaling in these cells
in vitro (Figure S2C).
Due to its activation upon loss of PTEN, mTOR
might govern the expression of VEGFR-2. Pharmacologic
inhibition of mTOR using CCI-779 (temsirolimus) depleted
VEGFR-2 protein levels in PTEN-deficient LN-308 glioma
cells (Figure 2A). Moreover, selective inactivation of
either mTORC1 or mTORC2 by RNAi-mediated knockdown of either raptor or rictor caused a robust decrease

in VEGFR-2 mRNA expression suggesting that both
mTOR complexes are required for VEGFR-2 expression
(Figure 2B). Exogenous expression of PTEN in PTENdeficient and VEGFR-2-positive LN-308 and U138MG
glioma cells (Figure 2C) led to reduced VEGFR-2 mRNA
and protein levels (Figure 2D), confirming a VEGFR2-suppressive effect for PTEN. In line with previous
reports, modulation of PTEN expression confirmed robust
antiinvasive and anticlonogenic properties for PTEN in
several glioma cell lines (Figure S3A–S3D).

Next, we wanted to know whether the inter­
dependence between PTEN loss and VEGFR-2 expression
in glioma cells can be confirmed in patient-derived tumor
tissues. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) for both proteins in
a series of 79 glioblastoma tissues demonstrated that of
these, 54 tumors were either positive for PTEN or tumoral
VEGFR-2 expression, and 25 tumors were negative for
both markers (Table  1). Importantly, we did not find a
single PTEN-positive glioblastoma containing VEGFR-2positive tumor cells (p < 0.001, exact Fisher test; Table 1),

further supporting our hypothesis that tumoral VEGFR-2
expression requires loss of PTEN.
PTEN IHC does not necessarily reflect genetic
alterations in the PTEN gene possibly leading to
translation of the full-length but yet dysfunctional PTEN
protein. Hence, we completed our study by sequencing and
multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA)
of the PTEN gene in 28 of the 79 glioblastoma specimens
(35%). This demonstrated PTEN mutations in four (by
sequencing) and deletions in all 12 tumors (by MLPA) that
were tested PTEN-negative on IHC. Conversely, 16 tumors
assessed as PTEN-positive on IHC revealed mutations in
only two cases and deletions in 12 additional cases (the
latter assumingly being functional heterodeletions).
Analysis of glioblastoma tissues from The Cancer
Genome Atlas (TCGA) database [17] demonstrated
increased VEGFR-2 protein expression determined with
reverse phase protein array in tumors with either copy
number variations (CNV) or mutations in the PTEN gene
compared with tumors without genetic alterations. Of
note, CD31 expression as a marker for endothelial cells
was not affected by PTEN alterations (Figure 2E).

shVEGFR-2 cells revealed impaired clonogenic survival
(Figure S5D). To further assess these VEGFR-2-dependent
effects in conditions that better resemble the threedimensional brain tissue cytoarchitecture in vivo, we set
up an experimental model system using organotypic brain
slice cultures (Figure S6A, S6B). Consistent with our
observations in vitro, LN-308 shcontrol cells implanted
in brain slices showed a higher proliferation rate than
shVEGFR-2 cells (Figure S6C), supporting the view of a
proproliferative function of VEGFR-2 in glioma cells.

Tumor cell expression of VEGFR-2 increases
resistance of glioma cells to TMZ
Next, we analyzed potential effects of tumoral
VEGFR-2 expression on clinically relevant modalities of
treatment in glioblastoma, i.e., alkylating chemotherapy
with temozolomide (TMZ) and radiotherapy. LN-308 and
U138MG shVEGFR-2 cells showed a higher sensitivity
to TMZ-induced G2 cell cycle arrest (Figure 3A and
Figure S7), whereas sensitivity towards radiotherapy was
unchanged (Figure 3A). Moreover, proliferation assays
performed over six days following TMZ treatment showed
a significant increase in sensitivity to TMZ in shVEGFR-2
cells, essentially confirming the cell cycle distribution data
and indicating that VEGFR-2-positive tumor cells are more
resistant to alkylating chemotherapy with TMZ (Figure 3B).

Tumor cell expression of VEGFR-2 drives glioma
cell proliferation and clonogenicity
To learn more about the intrinsic functions of
VEGFR-2 expression in tumor cells, we generated specific
shVEGFR-2 transfectants of LN-308 and U138MG glioma
cells as well as stably VEGFR-2-overexpressing LN-229
glioma cells (Figure S4). Available data on VEGFR-2 and
its effects on glioma cell proliferation are controversial
[15, 16]. In our hands, VEGFR-2 knock-down in LN-308
and U138MG glioma cells caused significantly decreased
proliferation compared with control cells (Figure S5A).
Pharmacological ablation of VEGFR-2 activity through
treatment with AZD2171 (Cediranib) demonstrated a
similar effect (Figure S5B). Vice versa, overexpression
of VEGFR-2 in LN-229 cells increased proliferation and
made these cells susceptible to treatment with AZD2171
that decreased proliferation of these cells significantly
(Figure S5C). Moreover, LN-308 and U138MG

Whole-genome mRNA microarray analyses
of LN-308 and U138MG shVEGFR-2 cells with
subsequent evaluation in an Ingenuity Pathway Analysis
(IPA) revealed the nuclear factor ‘kappa-light-chainenhancer’ of activated B-cells (NF-κB) complex as the
only transcription factor complex whose target genes
were significantly deregulated in both cell lines upon
VEGFR-2 knock-down. Altogether, 14 target genes of the
NF-κB complex were found to be regulated in response
to VEGFR-2 knock-down in LN-308 cells, whereas 23

target genes were affected in U138MG cells. The most
prominent NF-κB target genes were caveolin-1 (CAV1),
interleukin-6 (IL-6), interleukin-8 (IL-8), and the v-myc
myelocytomatosis viral oncogene homolog (c-myc)
(Figure 3C). Immunoblot analysis of p-p65 (RELA) as an
activation marker of the NFκB-complex showed increased
phosphorylation of p65 in VEGFR-2-positive cells
confirming the influence of VEGFR-2 on the activity of
the NF-κB-complex. Knock-down of VEGFR-2 in glioma
cells led to decreased phosphorylation and thus reduced
activity of two central resistance factors, protein kinase
B (AKT/PKB)S473 and N-myc downstream regulated
gene (NDRG)1T346 [11, 18], suggesting molecular cues
for the increased resistance of VEGFR-2-positive glioma
cells towards alkylating chemotherapy (Figure 3D).
Moreover, stimulation with VEGF (50 ng/ml) increased
phosphorylation of p65 in LN-308 wild-type cells
(Figure 3E).

These observations were corroborated by a further
IPA analysis of the above-mentioned microarray analysis
of LN-308 and U138MG shVEGFR-2 cells, focusing
on cellular movement, motility, migration and invasion.
This analysis revealed that all invasion-relevant topics,
especially ‘invasion of cells’ and ‘invasion of tumor
cells’, were positively correlated according to the gene
expression changes associated with the knock-down of
VEGFR-2. In contrast, the topics ‘cellular movement’ and
‘migration’ yielded in a less clear prediction of regulation.
The topic ‘migration of cancer cells’ was even negatively
correlated with the gene expression profile associated
with the knock-down of VEGFR-2 (Figure 5A). This is in
line with the findings from our functional in vitro assays
showing that knock-down of VEGFR-2 increases invasion
but does not affect migration of glioma cells. Finally, we
identified and confirmed upregulation of two candidate
molecules in response to knock-down of VEGFR-2 that
have been described to exert proinvasive functions:
chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand (CXCL)16 and Rho
guanine nucleotide exchange factor (ARHGEF)16 [19,
20]. Correspondingly, THY-1 cell surface antigen (CD90),
tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase (TIMP)-4 and
SERPIN F1, previously reported to negatively regulate
invasion of cancer cells, were found to be downregulated
(Figure 5B, 5C) [21–23].

Ablation of VEGFR-2 signaling in glioma cells
induces a proinvasive tumor cell phenotype
Ablation of VEGF/VEGFR-2 signaling both
genetically and pharmacologically using AZD2171 (100
nM) or BEV (1–3 mg/ml) increased cell invasion (Figure
4A; Figure S8A upper row) without affecting migration
(Figure S8A, lower row). As AZD2171 is a multikinase
inhibitor, we additionally assessed invasion of LN-308
shVEGFR-2 cells as well as VEGFR-2-negative LN229 cells following treatment with AZD2171. LN-308
shVEGFR-2 cells responded to AZD2171 treatment with
a strong increase in invasiveness that was significantly
higher than the level observed with shcontrol cells treated
with AZD2171 (Figure 4B). In contrast, the VEGFR-2negative cell line LN-229 showed an insignificant increase
in invasiveness and no change in migration, which is
basically assessed as chemotaxis upon treatment with
AZD2171 (Figure S8B), indicating that VEGFR-2 is a
major but not the exclusive factor controlling invasion
in response to anti-tyrosine-kinase treatment. Consistent
with these results, overexpression of VEGFR-2 in LN229 cells resulted in reduced invasiveness compared with
control cells (Figure 4C). Moreover, analysis of invasion
using the organotypic brain slice culture system ex vivo
corroborated these findings by demonstrating markedly
increased invasiveness for LN-308 shVEGFR-2 cells
(Figure 4D, left and middle), that corresponds to the lower
cellular density in tumors formed by shVEGFR-2 cells
(Figure 4D, right).
Of note, expression of the hepatocyte growth factor
(HGF) receptor MET in VEGFR-2-positive glioma cells
was heterogeneous. U138MG cells expressed high levels
of MET on mRNA and protein levels, whereas LN-308
glioma cells demonstrated almost no MET expression
(Figure S8C, left). These levels did not change upon
knock-down of VEGFR-2 (Figure S8C, right).

Selective knock-down of VEGFR-2 in glioma
cells induces a highly invasive and proangiogenic
growth pattern in a xenograft mouse model
We evaluated VEGFR-2-specific functions in
glioma cells in vivo and compared the growth pattern of
xenografted LN-308 shVEGFR-2 cells with shcontrol cells
in CD1 nu/nu mice (n = 6 per group). Post contrast T1
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was used to segment
the tumor and to calculate the tumor volumes. Mice
bearing a shVEGFR-2 tumor showed larger tumor volumes
in all four MRI sessions (Figure 6A, 6B). The mean tumor
volumes at day 43 post injection were 7.83 ± 2.67 μm3
for shcontrol tumors and 18.1 ± 5.8 μm3 for shVEGFR-2
tumors (p = 0.024). All six shcontrol tumors showed a
homogeneous contrast enhancement, whereas five of the
six shVEGFR-2 tumors appeared inhomogeneous with
a hypointense central lesion, diffuse tumor borders and
high contrast enhancement, suggesting infiltrative growth
and disruption of the blood-brain barrier (Figure 6A).
shVEGFR-2 tumors histologically displayed a locally
destructive growth pattern with marked tumor satellite
formation in contrast to shcontrol tumors that all displayed
a sharp tumor rim (Figure 6C). This was paralleled by a
strong activation of matrix metalloproteinases (MMP)-2
and -9 in shVEGFR-2 tumors (Figure 6D) suggesting a
proinvasive growth phenotype. Moreover, shVEGFR-2
tumors demonstrated a significant increase in CD31positive blood vessels when compared with control tumors

BEV treatment prolongs survival of patients
with PTEN-proficient glioblastomas

(Figure 7A, 7B) and extravasation of FITC-dextran that
had been perfused in a subgroup of mice (Figure 7A) as
well as a large peritumoral edema (Figure 7C), indicating
leakier vessels and proving a marked disruption of the
blood-brain barrier in these tumors. Cellular density was
significantly higher in shcontrol tumors when compared
with shVEGFR-2 tumors, resembling the growth pattern
previously observed in ex vivo brain slice culture
models (Figure 7D). One likely explanation for the
proangiogenic reaction is that the VEGFR-2 blockade
in glioma cells activates the autocrine/paracrine VEGF/
VEGFR-2 signaling pathway by increasing the production
of its ligand, VEGF, which could then act on the tumor
endothelium. This was supported by the observation
that we measured increased VEGF-A secretion into the
supernatants of LN-308 shVEGFR-2 cells compared with
shcontrol cells (Figure 7E).

Since the introduction of TMZ as first-line therapy
for malignant glioma PTEN loss has not been validated
as a prognostic biomarker for overall survival [24] as
we confirmed in a TCGA database analysis (Figure S9).
However, we wanted to know whether PTEN serving as a
surrogate marker for glioma cell VEGFR-2 expression is of
prognostic value selectively in patients treated with BEV. A
clinical case series of twenty-eight patients with recurrent
glioblastoma treated with BEV was retrospectively
assigned into a PTEN-positive (PTEN POS) or a PTENnegative (PTEN NEG) group as comprehensively assessed
by synoptic immunohistochemical, mutational and CNV
analyses. IDH1-mutant tumors were excluded from this
analysis because of their overall better prognosis and
almost mutual exclusivity with PTEN mutations. Patient
characteristics at the time of diagnosis were similar in both
groups (Table S2). After initiation of BEV therapy, PTEN
positivity correlated significantly with prolonged overall
survival (median 7 vs. 5 months, HR 0.46, 0.13–0.67,
p = 0.017) and progression-free survival (median 5.25 vs.
4 months, HR 0.38, 0.09–0.46, p = 0.002) compared with
PTEN-negative tumors (Figure 9).

Treatment with BEV exerts diminished
antiangiogenic but enhanced invasive effects in
VEGFR-2-positive tumors
We then wanted to know, whether BEV-induced
invasiveness is restricted to VEGFR-2-expressing glioma
cells. We tested BEV treatment in RTCA assays and
found that it causes proinvasive effects specifically in
VEGFR-2-positive control but not in shVEGFR-2 glioma
cells (Figure 8A). Of note, BEV-induced invasiveness
of VEGFR-2-positive glioma cells was concentrationdependent as treatment with low-dosed BEV (1 mg/
ml) resulted in 1.6-fold increased invasion, whereas
high-dosed BEV (3 mg/ml) stimulated invasion by
more than 3-fold (Figure 4A). Corresponding VEGFR2-dependent proinvasive effects of BEV were confirmed
in the brain slice culture model (Figure 8B). Aiming
at integrating the observed cellular effects in one
comprehensive animal model, we investigated nude mice
with an implanted cranial window upon inoculation of
LN-308 shcontrol or shVEGFR-2 cells for tumor cell
distribution and vessel architecture before and after
BEV treatment, using a two-photon microscope. Before
treatment, density of tumor-induced blood vessels in
shVEGFR-2 tumors was significantly higher than in
shcontrol tumors (Figure 8C, 8D). Treatment with BEV
for 32 days every second day (15 mg/kg bodyweight)
only caused a limited antiangiogenic effect in shcontrol
tumors (Figure 8C, upper row; Figure 8D). In contrast,
the vascular architecture of shVEGFR-2 tumors became
heavily disrupted upon BEV treatment compared with
the pretreatment situation and with control tumors
irrespective of BEV treatment (Figure 8C, lower row;
Figure 8D). Taken together, these results demonstrate that
the presence of VEGFR-2 on glioma cells both hampers
antiangiogenesis and predisposes to an adverse evasive
response when BEV is applied.

DISCUSSION
Expression of VEGFR-2 on non-endothelial cells
in cancer [14, 25–28] suggests additional functions of the
VEGF/VEGFR-2 system in neoplasms besides promoting
neovascularization. Specifically, Lu et al. recently
described a molecular mechanism by which VEGF
blockade in glioblastoma cells causes enhanced tumor
cell invasion through activation of the HGF receptor MET
in a hypoxia-independent manner inducing a program
reminiscent of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition
[6]. It is a matter of debate whether evasive resistance
is clinically relevant in general or may be restricted to
subgroups of patients. It is not clear, whether tumor cellexpressed VEGFR-2 plays a role in this setting [12–14].
Our data clearly suggest the existence of VEGFR-2expressing tumor cells not only in glioma cell lines and
GIC but also in patient-derived glioblastoma tissues,
preferentially in tumor infiltration zones.
VEGFR-2-positive glioma cells were exclusively
PTEN-deficient suggesting the requirement of PTEN
loss and subsequent activation of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR
signaling pathway. This was corroborated by our findings
that both pharmacological inhibition of mTOR activity
using CCI-779 and RNAi-mediated, selective blockade of
mTORC1 or 2 signaling each led to a robust downregulation
of VEGFR-2. Overexpression of PTEN in PTEN-deficient
cell lines reduced VEGFR-2 mRNA and protein expression.
However, this reduction was not as strong as through

inhibition of mTORC1 or 2, suggesting a more complex
regulation of VEGFR-2 via the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway.
Constrictively, we cannot rule out that some of the PTEN-/
VEGFR-2-negative tumors express VEGFR-2 in their
infiltration zone, since in our series infiltration zones were
not available for each tumor specimen.

Moreover, immunohistochemical identification
of glioblastoma cell VEGFR-2 positivity is technically
demanding and time-consuming, not least because the
fraction of VEGFR-2-positive cells within a given tumor
is comparatively low. Hence, we propose the PTEN status

as a valid surrogate marker that considerably increases the
chance of identifying tumors harboring VEGFR-2-positive
tumor cells.
We show here that glioma cell VEGFR-2 increases
tumor cell proliferation and clonogenicity in different test
paradigms, and mediates resistance towards clinically
relevant chemotherapy with TMZ, but not irradiation.
With a few exemptions, analyses of resistance mechanisms
mainly focus on cell-intrinsic mechanisms, which may
fall short the magnitude of the problem [29]. While a
direct role of VEGFR-2 as a mediator of chemoresistance
has not been determined so far, increased sensitivity
to alkylating drugs in response to treatment with antiVEGFR-2 agents is in line with preclinical findings [30,
31]. However, particularly in brain, a combined use of
anti-VEGFR-2 compounds and chemotherapy may exert
adverse effects, and has not translated into convincing
clinical results proving prolonged overall survival [32,
33], largely due to its controversially discussed effects
on the tumor vasculature leading to alterations in blood
flow, oxygenation status, and delivery of concurrent
chemotherapy, i.e., the role of vessel pruning vs.
normalization.
In our study, glioma cells express VEGFR-2 upon
loss of PTEN function through activation of AKT and
mTOR. VEGFR-2-dependent effects are paralleled by
a molecular expression profile comprising activation of
the NF-κB transcription factor complex, several of its
downstream genes, and two well-characterized signaling
proteins, AKT and NDRG1, that are central to mediate
chemoresistance [11, 18]. NF-κB is a transcription factor
complex that plays a pivotal role in carcinogenesis and
the regulation of immune and inflammatory responses
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

[34]. Activation of the NF-κB complex by the mutant and
constitutively active variant vIII of the epidermal growth
factor receptor (EGFR) was linked to alkylator resistance
in glioma cells [35, 36]. The fact that NF-κB mediates
its chemoresistance through inhibition of apoptosis after
DNA damage through chemo- or radiotherapy [37] and
the presence of an NF-κB binding site within the O6methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) promoter
[38] make an involvement of NF-κB in mediating
resistance to TMZ plausible.
We recently reported on the hypoxia-inducible
protein NDRG1 as a distinct regulator of resistance to
TMZ that does not protect against ionizing irradiation
[18]. Here, we found NDRG1 upregulated in VEGFR-2positive glioma cells, which explains well the increased
chemoresistance to TMZ (and not to radiotherapy)
observed in these cells. Though otherwise robustly induced
with hypoxia in perinecrotic tumor areas of glioblastoma,
NDRG1 was found here to be activated in VEGFR-2positive glioma cells, i.e., in cells that chiefly reside
within the tumor infiltration zone where sufficient oxygen
supplies are presumably given. Therefore, it seems likely
that the VEGFR-2-associated chemoresistance mediated
by NDRG1 is hypoxia-independent and alternatively
signaled through mTOR.
RNAi-mediated or pharmacological ablation of
VEGFR-2 activity increased invasiveness of glioma cells
in vitro and resulted in a diffuse and locally destructive
growth pattern in vivo, concomitant with a proinvasive
gene expression profile. These effects suggest that
VEGFR-2 has a negative impact on glioma cell invasion.
The locally destructive growth pattern is reflected by
a low cellular density in VEGFR-2-negative tumors
31063

suggesting higher tumor volumes on MRI than VEGFR2-positive tumors. This may be a plausible explanation
for our finding that the more proliferative VEGFR-2positive tumors appear smaller on MRI. We are aware
that the increased invasiveness of shVEGFR-2 cells is
not readily compatible with the localization of VEGFR2-positive cells to the infiltration zone. Hence, we assume
that those tumor cells upregulate VEGFR-2 expression
through alternative mechanisms of regulation such as
oxygen tensions that are higher in the infiltration zone
than in the tumor core, rather than a result of selected less
invasive tumor cells. Potential oxygen-dependent effects
on glioma cell-specific VEGFR-2 expression will require
more detailed investigations in the future.
Previous work described highly invasive and diffuse
tumor growth in response to knock-down of VEGF
resulting in inhibition of the VEGFR-2 pathway [6]. We
here complement those findings and identify a similar
mechanism by which glioma cell-selective ablation of
VEGFR-2 signaling causes a switch to a locally destructive
and highly angiogenic growth phenotype that produces
abnormal and leaky vessels leading to cerebral edema. The
lack of MET expression in one cell line, LN-308, suggests
an alternative mechanism besides the previously published
pathway through HGF/MET [6]. This is likely to be a
result of an induced autocrine/paracrine secretion of the
ligand VEGF, which, besides its proangiogenic effects,
increases vascular permeability [39], and leads to a more
proinvasive phenotype of glioma cells. Induced activity of
MMP-2/-9 and expression of ARHGEF16 and CXCL16
together with downregulation of antiinvasive THY-1,
TIMP-4 and SERPIN F1 fit well to the locally destructive
and invasive growth pattern observed with shVEGFR-2
tumors [19–23], and complement the findings reported
recently to explain this phenomenon [6]. Given an
antiinvasive function of glioma cell VEGFR-2 expression,
we consistently found in three independent experimental
paradigms in vitro, ex vivo and in vivo that ablation of
VEGF/VEGFR-2 signaling, genetically or with BEV
treatment, causes proinvasive reactions in the presence
of VEGFR-2. Although BEV treatments performed in
mouse models are limited in that only human VEGF-A
secreted by the xenografted glioma cells is blocked, we
found dramatically reduced antiangiogenic effects of
BEV in VEGFR-2-positive gliomas, while the absence
of VEGFR-2 led to a highly instable vascular system
susceptible to abrogation with BEV.
We identified glioma cell VEGFR-2 expression in
19% of all glioblastoma specimens tested. Notably, this
percentage roughly corresponds to the recently published
portion of recurrent malignant gliomas that displayed
distant or diffuse recurrence on MRI scans at the time of
failure of BEV-containing treatments [8]. It would have
been intriguing to evaluate those gliomas for tumor cell
VEGFR-2 positivity, but a lack of sufficient tissue material
did not allow such an investigation. Instead, we conducted
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

a retrospective analysis of clinically well-documented
patients with recurrent glioblastomas treated with BEV.
BEV significantly prolonged both overall and progressionfree survival of patients with PTEN-positive tumors when
compared with their PTEN-negative counterparts. As this
finding supports the view of PTEN as a potential predictor
of response to clinically relevant antiangiogenic treatment,
these data justify a validation in a prospective large-scale
patient cohort.
Conclusively, we identified two separate subgroups
of glioblastomas: (i) PTEN-positive tumors that do not
display glioma cell VEGFR-2 positivity (Figure 10, left)
and (ii) PTEN-negative tumors with a markedly increased
likelihood of glioma cell VEGFR-2 expression (~40%
in our series; Figure 10, right). The first subgroup is
less proliferative than the second and is expected to be
well-responsive to antiangiogenic treatment, and at a
low risk to develop early evasive resistance. The second,
in contrast, represents a more aggressive subgroup of
glioblastoma being more resistant to chemotherapy with
TMZ and at increased risk to develop early diffuse or
distant progression upon antiangiogenic therapy with BEV
leading to reduced survival. Hence, this latter subgroup
is likely to benefit from combined treatment concepts
integrating antiangiogenic with antiinvasive mechanisms
of action. Alternatively, one could argue not to treat this
glioblastoma subgroup with antiangiogenic agents at all.
Loss of PTEN can serve as a surrogate marker to identify
this subgroup upfront by routine neuropathological
methods before antiangiogenic treatment should be
considered.

Statistical analysis
Quantitative in vitro data are expressed as mean
± SD, as indicated. All in vitro experiments reported
here represent at least three independent replications
performed in triplicate. Statistical significance was
assessed by two-sided Student’s t-test (Excel, Microsoft,
Seattle, WA, USA). The exact Fisher test was applied to
correlate VEGFR-2 with PTEN expression. Univariate
survival analyses were performed using the Kaplan-Meier
estimator and the log-rank test. Values of p < 0.05 were
considered significant and asterisked.
