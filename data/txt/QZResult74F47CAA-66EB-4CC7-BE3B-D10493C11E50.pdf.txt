ING5 Is a Tip60 Cofactor That Acetylates p53 in Response to
DNA Damage
Nansong Liu, Jiadong Wang, Jifeng Wang, Rukai Wang, Zhongle Liu, Yao Yu, and Hong Lu

Abstract
Posttranslational modiﬁcation of p53 is a critical event in regulating the expression of its target genes. p53
is acetylated at lysine 120 (K120) by acetyltranferases Tip60 (KAT5) and hMOF (KAT8) in response to DNA
damage. Identiﬁcation of cofactors for these two enzymes will shed light on the mechanism by which cells
make a choice between cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis. It has been reported that ING5, a member of the
inhibitor of growth (ING) family, is involved in p53-dependent pathways, but its exact role is unknown. In this
study, we found that ING5 expression was signiﬁcantly increased and that ING5 assisted Tip60, but not
hMOF, in acetylating p53 at K120 in response to DNA damage. ING5 had no effect on acetylation of p53 at
K373/382, but it formed a complex with p53 and Tip60. ING5 was required for acetylation of p53 at K120, and
p53 acetylated at K120 subsequently bound to the promoters of its target apoptotic genes, BAX and GADD45,
to promote their expression and lead to apoptosis. Mutation of K120 to K120R abolished the effects of ING5
on p53-induced gene expression. Thus, we conclude that ING5 functions as a cofactor of Tip60 in the
acetylation of p53 at K120 in response to DNA damage. Cancer Res; 73(12); 3749–60. 2013 AACR.

Introduction
The inhibitor of growth (ING) family of proteins was identiﬁed more than a decade ago as potential tumor suppressors,
and these proteins play an important role in numerous cellular
processes and signaling pathways, such as cell-cycle progression, cell senescence, apoptosis, DNA repair, and NF-kappa B
signaling (1–3). ING proteins play a role in transcriptional
regulation with various binding partners, including histone
modiﬁers such as histone deacetylase (HDAC) and histone
acetyltransferase (HAT) (4–7).
All ING proteins share a similar phylogenetic conserved
structure. However, ING3 is relatively distant from other INGs,
whereas ING1 is closely related to ING2 and ING4 is closely
related to ING5 (8). Biochemical studies support these phylogenetic ﬁndings. ING1 and ING2 are part of the histone
deacetylase complex Sin3A (7). ING4 and ING5 are part of the
HBO1-containing HAT complex and are involved in acetylation
of histone H4 and activation of p53 (4, 9). In contrast, ING3 is
one part of the hNuA4 complex, which regulates the acetylation
of histones H2A and H4 (4, 5).
Although ING5 appears to overlap with ING4 in most
biochemical aspects and biologic functions, ING5 has also

been found to have functions that differ from those of ING4.
For example, ING5 is a subunit of a histone H3-speciﬁc HAT
complex that includes MOZ/MORF leukemic proteins (4).
ING5 expression has also been reported to be decreased in
certain tumors, such as gastric carcinoma (10), human head
and neck squamous cell carcinoma (11), and oral squamous
cell carcinoma (12). However, the biologic functions of ING5
are not as well understood as those of other members of the
ING family.
p53 is a tumor suppressor and transcriptional factor that
is regulated by numerous posttranslational modiﬁcations. In
response to DNA damage, p53 is modiﬁed and binds to
promoters of its speciﬁc target genes, such as p21, PUMA,
BAX, GADD45, and NOXA, to activate expression of these
genes, which are involved in either cell-cycle arrest or
apoptosis (13). Acetylation of p53 at various sites plays an
important role in regulating the transcriptional activity of
p53, and acetylation at different sites results in distinct
biologic outcomes. For example, acetylation of p53 at 3
lysines in the C terminus (i.e., K373, K382, and K320) by
p300/CBP or PCAF increases the stability of the protein and
enhances p53-dependent transcription, thus promoting
growth arrest or apoptosis (14, 15).
Recently, 2 independent groups reported simultaneously
that MYST family proteins, Tip60 (KAT5) and hMOF (KAT8),
directly acetylated p53 at lysine 120 (K120) within the DNAbinding domain (16, 17). Consequently, acetylated p53 activated expression of apoptotic genes and led to cell apoptosis.
However, DNA damage induced p53-dependent cell-cycle
arrest, rather than p53-dependent apoptosis, when acetylation
at K120 was eliminated by mutation of K120 to arginine, a
nonacetylatable residue. Furthermore, acetylation of p53 at
K120 has been found to be caused speciﬁcally by Tip60 and

hMOF, not by either CBP/p300 or PCAF. However, the regulator of p53 acetylation at K120 after DNA damage is still
unclear (16, 17).
All ING proteins except ING3 have been reported to coimmunoprecipitate with p53 and induce G1-phase cell-cycle
arrest or apoptosis in a p53-dependent manner (18–20). ING5
may induce apoptosis and/or cell-cycle arrest through the p53
pathway (19), but the molecular mechanism for this process is
not clear. In this study, we have provided experimental evidence of how ING5 functions in the p53 pathway in response to
DNA damage. Our results indicate that ING5 serves as a cofactor of Tip60, but not hMOF, to acetylate p53 at K120 and
subsequently activates the expression of p53-dependent apoptotic genes in response to DNA damage.

Materials and Methods
Plasmids, cell lines, and transfection
For cell transfection, ING5, Tip60, and hMOF were cloned
into the pCMV-Myc vector (Clontech), and p53 and its point
mutations (K120R, K373/382R) were cloned into the pCMV-HA
vector (Clontech). We also used the SFB vector with Tip60 or
empty SFB vector, as described previously (21). For subcellular
localization, ING5 was cloned into the pDsRed vector, and
Tip60 was cloned into the pEGFP vector (Clontech). For
shRNA-mediated silencing, ING5 was cloned into the pSilencer
vector (Ambion). p53 and its truncated deletions were cloned
into the pGEX-5X-1 vector (GE Healthcare) to express GSTfusion proteins.
Hepatocellular carcinoma cell line HepG2 and osteosarcoma cell lines U-2 OS (p53þ) and Saos-2 (p53-null) were maintained in Dulbecco's Modiﬁed Eagle's Medium supplemented
with 10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone). Cells were transfected
with Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Invitrogen) or FUGENE-HD
(Roche) according to the manufacturer's instructions.
Immunoﬂuorescence and protein subcellular
localization
In brief, U-2 OS cells were ﬁxed with 100% methanol,
permeabilized with 0.01% Triton X-100 in phosphate-buffered
saline (PBS), and then incubated with anti-ING5 antibody for 1
hour at room temperature. The cells were washed with PBS and
incubated with ﬂuorescein isothiocyanate conjugated with a
secondary antibody for 1 hour in a humidiﬁed chamber at
room temperature. The cells were then washed with PBS and
stained with 1 mg/mL 40 ,60 -diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) to
visualize nuclei. Images were captured under an Olympus IX71
laser microscope (Olympus).
Knockdown of ING5, Tip60, and hMOF
Tip60 was knocked down by transfection of U-2 OS cells with
a siRNA duplex (GGACAGCUCUGAUGGAAUAtt) corresponding to the human Tip60 mRNA. A different siRNA duplex
(CCAUCUCCUUCUUUGAGAUtt) was used to ablate endogenous hMOF. A nontarget siRNA duplex (UUCUCCGAACGUGUCACGUtt) was used as a negative control. Cells were
transfected with pSilencer-ING5 to knock down ING5 or with
a void vector as a negative control (22).

Protein interaction assay
GST-p53 and GST-p53 fragment fusion proteins were separately expressed in bacteria and puriﬁed using glutathioneSepharose (GE Healthcare). Whole-cell extract from U-2 OS
cells containing Myc-Tip60 and Myc-ING5 was used to conduct
the pull-down assay. For the coimmunoprecipitation (Co-IP)
assay, U-2 OS cells were cotransfected with pCMV-Myc-Tip60,
pCMV-Myc-ING5, and pCMV-HA-p53. Forty-eight hours after
transfection, cells were collected and lysed in TPER Lysis Buffer
(Pierce) for analysis, as described previously (23).
Detection of posttranslational modiﬁcations of p53
In U-2 OS cells transfected with pCMV-ING5, pCMV-Tip60,
or pCMV-hMOF, acetylation of p53 at K120 or at K373/382 was
analyzed using anti-p53 acetyl-K120 antibody (Abcam
ab78316; Abcam) or anti-p53 acetyl-K373/382 antibody (Millipore, 06-758). Densities of the bands of interest were quantiﬁed
using BandScan 5.0 software (www.seekbio.com/soft/254.
html) and normalized to the densities of b-actin.
Chromatin immunoprecipitation
U-2 OS cells were transfected with pSilencer-ING5 or pSilencer void vector and treated with doxorubicin (DOX). Cells were
cross-linked using 1% formaldehyde for 10 minutes at room
temperature and then subjected to the chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay following the protocol of the kit (Millipore 17-295). Puriﬁed immunoenriched samples were used for
sequence-speciﬁc polymerase chain reaction (PCR) reaction
mixtures, and genomic DNA in the lysate served as the input.
Analysis of apoptosis by ﬂow cytometry
U-2 OS cells transfected with pSilencer-ING5 or pSilencer
void vector were harvested using trypsinization and ﬁxed in
70% cold ethanol. Cells were resuspended in 1 mL of PBS
containing 200 mg/mL RNase A (Sigma) and 20 mg/mL propidium iodide (Sigma), and the cells were then incubated at room
temperature for 15 minutes. Ten thousand cells were measured
using ﬂow cytometry and apoptotic cells were measured by
counting sub-2N population (24). Data were analyzed using
CellFIT software (Becton-Dickinson).
Real-time PCR
Total RNA was extracted using Trizol (Invitrogen) and
reverse-transcribed into cDNA. Real-time PCR was conducted
using SYBR Premix Ex Taq II (Takara), using cDNA as the
template in an iCycler iQ real-time PCR system (Bio-Rad).
Reactions started at 95 C for 1 minute, followed by 40 cycles of
5 seconds at 95 C alternating with 30 seconds at 60 C. Primers

that can induce DNA double-strand breaks (25). As shown
in Fig. 1, both mRNA and protein expression levels of endogenous ING5 increased after treatment with DOX. The mRNA
level of ING5 was about 3 times as high in cells treated with 1
mmol/L DOX for 24 hours as it was in cells that were not treated
with DOX (Fig. 1A). The increased protein levels of ING5 were
dose-dependent within tested concentrations of DOX ranging
from 0.5 to 10 mmol/L and time-dependent for treatment with 1
mmol/L DOX over durations ranging from 12 to 60 hours (Fig.
1B and C). In addition, ING5 accumulation in the nucleus
increased in response to DOX-induced DNA damage (Fig. 1D).
Interestingly, the level of endogenous ING4 appeared to
decrease after treatment of cells with 5 or 10 mmol/L DOX,
suggesting that ING4 may be involved in a different DNA
damage response pathway than ING5 (Fig. 1B).
Considering that DNA damage can activate p53 and increase
acetylation of p53 (16, 17, 26), we analyzed the changes in

The threshold cycle (CT) of each sample was determined by
the real-time PCR system and then normalized to the values for
GADPH using the following equation: DCT ¼ CT(gene of interest) 
CT(GADPH). The relative level was calculated as 2DCT. The
reaction for each sample was conducted in triplicate.

ING5 is required for acetylation of p53 at K120
As shown in Fig. 1, expression levels of ING5 and p53
acetylated at K120 both increased in response to DOX-induced
DNA damage, suggesting a potential relationship. We next
used a short-hairpin RNA method to knock down ING5 in U-2

OS cells to examine the role of ING5 in the p53 pathway during
DNA damage. As shown in Fig. 2A, knockdown of endogenous
ING5 substantially repressed acetylation of p53 at K120 but not
acetylation of p53 at K373/382 in response to DNA damage;
expression of p53 was affected by treatment with DOX, but
almost no effects were observed from knockdown of endogenous ING5. On the other hand, expression of Tip60 was not
affected by either DNA damage or knockdown of endogenous
ING5 (Fig. 2A).
Consistent with previous reports (16, 17), overexpression of
either Tip60 or hMOF increased expression levels of p53
acetylated at K120 in U-2 OS cells (Fig. 2B). Similarly, overexpression of ING5 enhanced acetylation of p53 at K120
(Fig. 2B). These results combined with those in Fig. 1B and

expression levels of endogenous p53 and p53 acetylated at
K120 or K373/382 after DOX treatment. As expected, expression levels of endogenous p53 increased, and levels of p53
acetylated at K120 also increased after treatment with DOX.
Acetylation of p53 at K373/382 also increased after treatment
with 0.5 mmol/L DOX (Fig. 1B), but expression of p53 acetylated
at K373/382 decreased with prolonged treatment with DOX
(Fig. 1C).

ING5 Is Required for Acetylation of p53K120 upon DNA Damage

C strongly suggest the involvement of ING5 in acetylation of
p53 at K120.
To address whether ING5 is involved in acetylation of p53 at
K120 through Tip60 and/or hMOF, endogenous TIP60, hMOF,
or ING5 was knocked down individually or in combination.
Knockdown of TIP60 or hMOF reduced the levels of p53
acetylated at K120 to about 60% of the levels in the control
cells, whereas coknockdown of TIP60 and hMOF reduced the
levels of p53 acetylated at K120 to 6% of the levels in the control
cells, suggesting that TIP60 and hMOF mediate acetylation of
p53 at K120 through different pathways (Fig. 2C). Similarly,
coknockdown of ING5 and hMOF reduced the levels of p53
acetylated at K120 to 9% of the levels in the control cells,
suggesting that ING5 and hMOF function in different pathways
(Fig. 2C). In contrast, coknockdown of ING5 and TIP60 reduced
the levels of p53 acetylated at K120 to 46% (Fig. 2C). This level is
modestly lower than that in the Tip60 knockdown cells (63%),
which might be due to the relatively lower level of Tip60 in the
coknockdown cells. These data suggest that ING5 mediates
acetylation of p53 at K120 in the same pathway with Tip60, but
not with hMOF.
In addition to ING5, the protein PDCD5 is also involved in
Tip60-mediated acetylation of p53 at K120. PDCD5 has been
found to promote the stability of Tip60 and increase acetylation of p53 at K120 after DNA damage (27). As shown in Fig. 2D,
overexpressing either ING5 or PDCD5 increased acetylation of
p53 at K120, and overexpressing both proteins led to an
additive increase. Therefore, ING5 stimulation and PDCD5
stimulation of Tip60-mediated acetylation of p53 at K120 may
occur through different pathways.
ING5 associates with Tip60, but not hMOF, to form a
complex with p53
We further have shown the involvement of ING5 in the
acetylation of p53 at K120 through Tip60, but not hMOF, by
investigating the interaction among ING5, Tip60, and hMOF.
As shown in Fig. 3A, a clear association between Tip60 and
ING5 was visible after treatment with DOX, whereas hMOF had
no interaction with ING5 regardless of DOX treatment. The
association between Tip60 and ING5 was also suggested by the
colocalization of fusion proteins GFP-Tip60 and RFP-ING5 in
HepG2 cells (Fig. 3B). Furthermore, endogenous association
between ING5 and Tip60 was identiﬁed, and that association
was signiﬁcantly strengthened after treatment with DOX (Fig.
3C). These results strongly suggest that ING5 is closely associated with Tip60, but not hMOF, after DNA damage. We also
found that Myc-ING5 can immunoprecipitate endogenous p53
in our Co-IP analysis (Fig. 3D), which is consistent with a
previous report (4), and this result indicates an interaction
between ING5 and p53.
To determine whether ING5 forms a protein complex with
Tip60 and p53, an in vitro pull-down assay was conducted. GSTp53 or GST expressed in Escherichia coli was immobilized on
sepharose beads and mixed with the lysate of U-2 OS cells
cotransfected with pCMV-Myc-ING5 and pCMV-Myc-Tip60.
As shown in Fig. 3E, both Tip60 and ING5 interacted with GSTp53, but not with GST. This was conﬁrmed by the Co-IP result
in Fig. 3G. U-2 OS cells were cotransfected with Myc-ING5 and

www.aacrjournals.org

Myc-Tip60 as well as HA-p53, and Myc-ING5 and Myc-Tip60
could be detected in the immunoprecipitates of HA-p53.
The semiendogenous Co-IP assay was also conducted to
analyze the interaction between p53, Tip60, and ING5 before
and after treatment with DOX. U-2 OS cells were transfected
with SFB-Tip60 and immunoprecipitated with S protein
sepharose. As shown in Fig. 3F, endogenous p53 interacted
with SFB-Tip60 regardless of DOX treatment, whereas endogenous ING5 associated with SFB-Tip60 apparently after treatment with DOX, suggesting that ING5 forms a complex with
Tip60 and p53 in vivo in response to DNA damage.
To locate the region of p53 that binds with Tip60 or ING5,
serial truncated fragments of p53 fused with GST were
expressed in E. coli and mixed with the lysate of U-2 OS cells
containing Myc-ING5 and Myc-Tip60. As shown in Fig. 4, Tip60
bound to the region of p53 from amino acid 50 to 250, whereas
ING5 bound to the fragment from amino acid 250 to 393. These
results showed that p53 could use different regions to interact
with ING5 and Tip60, which suggests a possible ternary p53ING5-Tip60 complex in vivo.
ING5 is required for p53-mediated apoptosis in response
to DNA damage
The involvement of ING5 in acetylation of p53 at K120
prompted us to identify the effects of ING5 on the expression
of p53 target genes, including the apoptosis-related genes Bcl-2,
BAK, BAX, and GADD45; the cell-cycle–related gene p21; and
the negative-feedback gene MDM2. ING5 was knocked down by
shRNA in U-2 OS cells and its level was determined by Western
blotting (Fig. 5A). In the cells transfected with the shRNA
void vector, mRNA levels of BAX, GADD45, p21, and MDM2
increased after 24 hours of treatment with DOX, mRNA levels
of Bcl-2 decreased, and mRNA levels of BAK did not change (Fig.
5B, columns 1 and 3). The expression of BAX and GADD45 after
treatment with DOX was substantially lower in cells with ING5
knockdown than in cells transfected with control vector,
whereas the expression of other tested genes after treatment
with DOX was the same in ING5-knockdown and control
vector-transfected cells (Fig. 5B, columns 3 and 4).
The effect of ING5 on cell apoptosis was further analyzed. As
shown in Fig. 5C, more than 15% of cells were apoptotic when
normal U-2 OS cells were treated with DOX for 24 hours. A
similar apoptotic rate was observed after treatment with DOX
in the control cells transfected with the shRNA void vector.
However, ING5-knockdown cells were more resistant to apoptosis; the apoptotic rate was only about 5% after treatment
with DOX. These results indicate that ING5 is required for the
expression of p53-targeted apoptotic genes BAX and GADD45
and subsequent apoptosis after DNA damage.
ING5 is recruited to promoters of the p53 target genes
after DNA damage
It has been reported that selective acetylation of p53 by
speciﬁc acetyltransferases and cofactors can regulate the
binding of p53 to the target promoters (16, 28). Thus, we
investigated the occupancies of ING5, p53, and Tip60 at

observed for Tip60, suggesting a constitutive interaction
between p53 and Tip60. p53 acetylated at K120 accumulated
at the promoters of BAX and GADD45, but not at the promoter
of p21, and the same binding pattern was observed for ING5
(Fig. 6). However, in ING5-knockdown cells treated with DOX,
recruitment of p53 and Tip60 to the promoters of the apoptotic
genes BAX and GADD45 decreased signiﬁcantly, and p53
acetylated at K120 at these 2 promoters was almost undetectable. In contrast, p53 acetylated at K373/382 speciﬁcally targeted the promoter of p21 (29), but not the promoters of BAX

and GADD45, and this binding pattern was not affected by
ING5 (Fig. 6). These results indicate that ING5 is required for
the acetylation of p53 at K120 after DNA damage, and this
acetylation is necessary for the recruitment of p53, Tip60, and
ING5 to the promoters of apoptotic genes but not to the
promoters of cell-cycle genes.

activation of apoptotic genes after DNA damage. To address
the question of whether ING5 is involved in other modiﬁcations of p53 that contribute to p53-mediated transcriptional
activation, we constructed a mutant p53K120R, which cannot
be acetylated at site 120 owing to the replacement of K with R. A
mutant p53K373/382R was also constructed and used as a
control. p53-null Saos-2 cells were cotransfected with ING5
shRNA and pCMV-HA-p53wt, p53K120R, or p53K373/382R and
then treated with DOX for 24 hours. As expected, no detectable

expression of p53 was observed in cells transfected with p53wt,

ING5 was substantially inhibited by ING5 shRNA (Fig. 7A).

suggest that acetylation of p53 at K120 did not contribute to the
activation of p21, nor did ING5. However, the cells transfected
with p53K373/382R exhibited the same transcriptional pattern
as cells transfected with p53wt or p53K120R. This may indicate
that other modiﬁcations of p53, such as acetylation at K164 and
K320, play a role in the activation of p21 (30, 31).
Expression of p53-target apoptotic genes GADD45 and BAX
did not detectably change when cells were transfected with
p53K120R, regardless of ING5 (Fig. 7C and D, p53K120R group).
However, in cells transfected with p53wt or p53K373/382R,
depletion of ING5 notably reduced expression of these 2
apoptotic genes. These results indicate that ING5 plays a role
in transcriptional activation of p53-target genes through acetylation of p53 at K120, but not through acetylation at other
sites, such as K373/382.
Furthermore, apoptosis of the transfected Saos-2 cells was
analyzed by ﬂow cytometry analysis. As shown in Fig. 7E, more
than 15% of cells were apoptotic in Saos-2 cells cotransfected
with pCMV-p53wt and the empty shRNA vector after treatment with DOX for 24 hours, whereas the percentage of
apoptotic cells was only about 6% after knockdown of ING5.
In Saos-2 cells cotransfected with p53K120R and the empty
shRNA vector, about 3% of cells were apoptotic after treatment
with DOX, and the same percentage of apoptotic cells was
observed in the cells cotransfected with p53K120R and ING5
shRNA. These results further support the hypothesis that ING5
is involved in the acetylation of p53 at K120 and consequently
affects the expression of p53-target genes BAX and GADD45, as
well as p53-dependent apoptosis.

Discussion
ING proteins have recently received more and more attention because of their involvement in p53-dependent pathways
and tumorigenesis of multiple tumors (32, 33). To the best of
our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst report to show that ING5
assisted acetyltransferase Tip60 in modifying p53 at K120 in
response to DNA damage. Knockdown of endogenous ING5 by
shRNA led to decreased acetylation of p53 at K120 (Fig. 2A),
which led to inhibited expression of the apoptotic genes BAX

and GADD45, which are regulated by p53 acetylated at K120,
and consequently reduced apoptosis of DNA-damaged cells
(Figs. 5, 6). When K120 was mutated to K120R, no induction
was observed for apoptotic genes BAX and GADD45 after DNA
damage, whether endogenous ING5 was inhibited or not (Fig.
7). In addition, ING5 was not found to affect acetylation of p53
at K373/382 (Fig. 2A). These results suggest that the involvement of ING5 in the modiﬁcation of p53 is site speciﬁc.
Both of the acetyltransferases Tip60 and hMOF can acetylate
p53 at K120 (16). However, we found that ING5 can function as
a cofactor only for Tip60, not for hMOF (Figs. 2C and 3A).
Although both Tip60 and hMOF responded to DNA damage by
modifying p53 at K120, they may work through different
pathways (Fig. 2C). Thus, if one of the pathways is defective,
cells can still respond to DNA damage by using the alternative
pathway.
Previously, ING5 has been deﬁned as a cofactor that assists
HAT in modifying chromatin. Previous studies have shown
that ING5 may stimulate acetylation of histone H4 via HBO1
and acetylation of histone H3K9 via MOZ/MORF (4). Our data
suggest that ING5 stimulates Tip60-mediated acetylation of
nonhistone substrates such as p53. Previous studies have
shown that PDCD5 may also promote acetylation of p53 at
K120 (27). Our results suggest that ING5 and PDCD5 function
through different pathways (Fig. 2D). Interestingly, another
factor, TRIM29, has been shown to accelerate the degradation
of Tip60 and negatively regulate the acetylation of p53 at K120
(34). Therefore, several carefully coordinating factors appear to
be involved in the regulation of acetylation of p53 at K120,
reﬂecting the essential role of this modiﬁcation in the apoptosis induced by DNA damage.
Posttranslational modiﬁcation of p53 at its DNA-binding
region directly affects its transcriptional activity with cell-cycle
or apoptotic genes (31). p300/CBP-mediated acetylation of p53
at K164 activates the expression of the cell-cycle gene p21 and
promotes cell-cycle arrest at the G1/S phase for DNA repair
(31). p53 acetylated at K373/382 binds to the promoter of cellcycle gene p21, but not to promoters of BAX and GADD45
(Fig. 6). p53 acetylated at K120 tends to bind to promoters of

apoptotic genes BAX (Fig. 6), GADD45 (Fig. 6), and PUMA (16,
17) under stress, which activates expression of these genes and
promotes cell apoptosis (Fig. 5). In contrast, p53 acetylated at
K120 does not bind to the promoter of p21 (Fig. 6). It is possible
that, after DNA damage in vivo, ING5, p53, and Tip60 form a
complex (Fig. 3E–G) by ING5 binding to the C-terminus of p53

3758

and Tip60 binding to the N-terminus of p53 (Fig. 4). Subsequently, ING5 assists Tip60 in acetylating p53 at K120 and
promotes p53-dependent apoptosis (Figs. 5 and 7). However,
the process by which acetylation of p53 at various sites is
regulated and balanced after DNA damage remains to be
determined.

ING5 Is Required for Acetylation of p53K120 upon DNA Damage

Expression of ING5 increased and ING5 was found to be
localized in the nucleus in response to DNA damage in the
present study (Fig. 1D). ING proteins are not always in the
nucleus; they enter the nucleus after external stimuli such as
DNA damage signals (35, 36). Translocation of ING5 has also
been observed in tumorigenesis and progression (10–12).
Various ING proteins enter the nucleus by different mechanisms. ING1 depends on NLS for entering the nucleus (36), and
ING2 enters the nucleus via the combination of PHD and
phosphtidylinositol 5-phosphate, a phospholipid molecule
induced by DNA damage (35). Unlike ING2 PHD, ING5 PHD
cannot bind to the phospholipid for activation (35), and thus
ING5 cannot enter the nucleus in the same way as ING2.
Analysis at http://expasy.org/ has revealed the existence of
potential sites for acetylation and phosphorylation in ING5.
However, we did not ﬁnd any detectable acetylation and/or
phosphorylytion of ING5 itself after DNA damage by using
general or site-speciﬁc acetyl- or phospho-antibodies (data not
shown). Thus, it is plausible that ING5 enters the nucleus
through NLS. However, this hypothesis awaits conﬁrmation.
In summary, in response to DNA damage, ING5 is required
for Tip60-modiﬁed, but not hMOF-modiﬁed, acetylation of p53
at a speciﬁc site K120.
