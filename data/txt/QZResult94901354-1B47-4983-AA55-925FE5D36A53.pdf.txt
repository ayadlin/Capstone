ABSTRACT
The mTOR pathway controls mRNA translation of mitogenic proteins and is a
central regulator of metabolism in malignant cells. Development of malignant cell
resistance is a limiting factor to the effects of mTOR inhibitors, but the mechanisms
accounting for such resistance are not well understood. We provide evidence that
mTORC1 inhibition by rapamycin results in engagement of a negative feedback
regulatory loop in malignant medulloblastoma cells, involving phosphorylation
of the eukaryotic translation-initiation factor eIF4E. This eIF4E phosphorylation
is Mnk2- mediated, but Mnk1-independent, and acts as a survival mechanism for
medulloblastoma cells. Pharmacological targeting of Mnk1/2 or siRNA-mediated
knockdown of Mnk2 sensitizes medulloblastoma cells to mTOR inhibition and
promotes suppression of malignant cell proliferation and anchorage-independent
growth. Altogether, these findings provide evidence for the existence of a Mnk2controlled feedback loop in medulloblastoma cells that accounts for resistance to
mTOR inhibitors, and raise the potential for combination treatments of mTOR and
Mnk inhibitors for the treatment of medulloblastoma.

INTRODUCTION

However, a frequent challenge for targeted intervention
is the emergence of resistance to therapy because of
compensatory activation of alternative signaling pathways.
Thus, it is likely that effective targeted therapies for
medulloblastoma will require combined regimens, aimed
to simultaneously target resistance mechanisms. For
instance, mouse models involving medulloblastomas with
mutations in the sonic hedgehog (Shh) pathway frequently
develop resistance to Smoothened (Smo) antagonists over
time [6]. However, when NVP-BEZ235, an inhibitor of
mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) and PI3K is
used in combination with the smoothened antagonists,

Medulloblastoma is the most common malignant
brain tumor in children, comprising over 20% of all
central nervous system tumors [1]. Recent advances in
genomic medicine have led to the identification of four
subtypes of medulloblastoma based on the presence of
distinct genetic markers [2-4]. These include: WNT, sonic
hedgehog (SHH), group 3, and group 4 (reviewed in [5]).
The identification of distinct medulloblastoma subgroups
has suggested that specific targeting of dysregulated
pathways should have significant therapeutic implications.

resistance is substantially delayed or even prevented [6].
This suggests that inhibitors of the PI3K/mTOR pathway
may be promising in combination therapies for certain
medulloblastoma subgroups.
The mTOR pathway mainly regulates initiation of
mRNA translation, ultimately controlling protein synthesis
and expression [7, 8]. It is well established that the overall
rate of protein synthesis is an important determinant of
cancer cell metabolism [9]. Many previous observations
have indicated that dysregulated growth pathways in
human cancers are involved in the control of translation
supporting cell proliferation and survival [8]. In response
to nutrients and growth factors, activation of Akt/mTOR
pathways results in enhanced global protein synthesis
[8]. Among the key effectors of the mTOR pathway are
the S6 kinase (p70-S6K1) and the eukaryotic translation
initiation factor 4E-binding protein 1 (4E-BP1), which acts
as a translational repressor by inhibiting the function of the
cap-binding protein, eukaryotic translation initiation factor
4E (eIF4E) [10].
MAP (mitogen-activated protein) kinase-interacting
kinases (Mnk1/2) have been previously shown to
phosphorylate the eukaryotic translation initiation factor
4E (eIF4E) on Ser-209 [11]. The phosphorylation of

eIF4E on Ser-209 is frequently increased in cancer cells
and eIF4E expression levels are upregulated in many
tumors [12-14]. Phosphorylation of eIF4E on Ser-209 is
crucial for its transforming/oncogenic ability [15, 16].
There is some evidence that phosphorylation of eIF4E at
this site may account in part for resistance to mTORC1
inhibition [17-20], but the precise mechanisms remain to
be defined. In the present study, we sought to determine
whether eIF4E phosphorylation accounts for resistance
to mTORC1 inhibition in medulloblastoma cells and, if
so, to investigate the mechanisms of cross-talk between
the mTOR and Mnk pathways in medulloblastoma cells.
Our data provide evidence for a unique Mnk2-mediated
mechanism and suggest that combinations of mTOR and
Mnk2 inhibitors may provide a therapeutic approach for
human medulloblastoma.

RESULTS
In initial studies, we sought to examine the effects
of different mTOR inhibitors on the phosphorylation/
activation of eIF4E in human medulloblastoma cells.
As shown in Fig. 1, treatment of Daoy medulloblastoma
cells with rapamycin induced phosphorylation of eIF4E

Figure 1: Rapalogs increase phosphorylation of eIF4E on Ser-209 in medulloblastoma cells. (A) Daoy cells were incubated
with rapamycin (20 nM) or OSI-027 (5 µM) for 90 minutes. Cell lysates were resolved by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with antibodies
against the phosphorylated forms of eIF4E (pSer-209), p70-S6K (pThr-389), and Akt (pSer-473). The corresponding same blots were
stripped and reprobed with antibodies against eIF4E, p70-S6K and Akt, respectively, as indicated. (B) Daoy cells were incubated with
rapamycin (20 nM), everolimus (200 nM), temsirolimus (5 µM) or OSI-027 (5 µM) for 90 min. Cell lysates were resolved by SDS-PAGE
and immunoblotted with antibodies against the phosphorylated forms of eIF4E (pSer-209), p70-S6K (pThr-389), Akt (pSer-473) and
4E-BP1 (pThr-37/46). The corresponding same blots were stripped and reprobed with antibodies against total eIF4E, p70-S6K, Akt and
4E-BP1, respectively as indicated. The bands from the anti-phospho-eIF4E and anti-eIF4E blots were quantitated by densitometry using
ImageJ, and data were expressed as ratios of p-eIF4E/eIF4E, as shown in the bar graphs below the top 2 blots.

on Ser-209 (Fig. 1A), suggesting activation of a feedback
loop during mTORC1 inhibition in these cells. On the
other hand, treatment with the ATP-competitive mTOR
inhibitor OSI-027 did not result in an increase eIF4E
phosphorylation (Fig. 1A). The activities and specificities
of both rapamycin and OSI-027 were confirmed by
monitoring phosphorylation of the mTORC1 substrate
p70-S6K on Thr-389 and the mTORC2-mediated
phosphorylation of Akt on Ser-473 [21, 22]. In addition
to rapamycin, treatment with the rapalogs everolimus and
temsirolimus also increased phosphorylation of eIF4E on
Ser-209 (Fig. 1B).
Rapalogs bind the FK506-binding protein

(FKBP12) and this complex inhibits rapamycin-sensitive
mTORC1 but not rapamycin-insensitive mTORC1 or
mTORC2 complexes [8, 21, 23]. As OSI-027 did not
induce phosphorylation of eIF4E on Ser209, we sought
to investigate whether increased eIF4E phosphorylation
is indirectly dependent on mTOR catalytic activity.
Simultaneous treatment of Daoy cells with OSI027 completely blocked rapamycin-induced eIF4E
phosphorylation (Fig. 2A), suggesting that the rapamycininduced increase of eIF4E phosphorylation on Ser209 requires mTOR kinase activity. These findings
also suggested that the induction of this mTOR kinase
activity either involves mTORC2-mediated signaling

Figure 2: Rapamycin-induced phosphorylation of eIF4E. (A) Daoy cells were incubated with rapamycin (25 nM) and/or OSI-

027 (10 µM) for 90 min. Cell lysates were resolved by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with antibodies against the phosphorylated form
of eIF4E (pSer-209) or GAPDH (upper and lower panels). Equal amounts of cell lysates from the same experiment were analyzed in
parallel by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted against eIF4E (middle panel). (B) Daoy cells were transfected with control or 4E-BP1 siRNA.
After 48 hours, cells were treated with rapamycin (20 nM) or OSI-027 (5 µM) for 90 min. Cell lysates were resolved by SDS-PAGE and
immunoblotted with antibodies against the phosphorylated forms of eIF4E (pSer-209) or 4E-BP1 (pThr-37/46). The same blot was stripped
and reprobed with antibodies against eIF4E or 4E-BP1, as indicated. (C) Daoy cells were transfected with either control or p70-S6K1
siRNA. After 48 hours, cells were treated with rapamycin (20 nM) or OSI-027 (5 µM) for 90 min. Cell lysates were resolved by SDS-PAGE
and immunoblotted with antibodies against the phosphorylated forms of eIF4E (pSer-209), p70-S6K (pThr-389), Akt (pSer-473), 4E-BP1
(pThr-37/46) or tubulin. The corresponding same blots were stripped and reprobed with antibodies against total eIF4E, p70-S6K, Akt or
4E-BP1, as indicated. (D) Sin1+/+ and Sin1-/- MEFs were treated with Rapamycin (20 nM) for 90 min and equal amounts of protein were
processed for immunoblotting with antibodies for phosphorylated eIF4E (pSer-209) (upper panel). The immunoblot with antibodies against
total eIF4E protein was from lysates from the same experiment analyzed in parallel by SDS-PAGE (lower panel).

events, or rapamycin-insensitive (RI) mTORC1 events.
Notably, phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 on Thr-37/46 has
been previously shown to be mediated by rapamycininsensitive mTORC1 complexes in different malignant
cell types [8, 21, 23, 24]. Therefore, we examined
whether 4E-BP1 is required for rapamycin-mediated
increase in eIF4E phosphorylation. As expected, siRNAmediated knockdown of 4E-BP1 led to increased eIF4E
phosphorylation (Fig. 2B, compare lanes 1 and 2),
reflecting an increase in the amount of free eIF4E available
for Mnk-mediated phosphorylation. However, treatment
with rapamycin increased eIF4E phosphorylation further
(Fig. 2B, compare lanes 2 and 4), suggesting that rapaloginduced eIF4E phosphorylation is independent of 4E-BP1
levels.
Inhibition of the mTORC1-p70-S6K pathway
by rapalogs has been shown to relieve repression of a
negative feedback loop, resulting in mTORC2 activation
by preventing p70-S6K mediated Rictor phosphorylation
on Thr-1135 [25, 26] and Sin1 phosphorylation on Thr86 and Thr-398 [27]. As the catalytic mTOR inhibitor
OSI-027 blocks rapalog-induced eIF4E phosphorylation,
we examined the possibility that such phosphorylation
is triggered by inhibition of the negative feedback-loop,
resulting in activation of mTORC2 in response to p70S6K inhibition. To this end, we knocked down p70-S6K
using specific siRNA and investigated whether rapamycin
is still able to induce eIF4E phosphorylation in the
absence of p70-S6K. Knockdown of p70-S6K increased
phosphorylation of eIF4E, but rapamycin treatment further
increased eIF4E phosphorylation although p70-S6K levels
were substantially reduced (Fig. 2C). This suggested that
rapamycin-induced increase in eIF4E phosphorylation
is independent of p70-S6K-regulated feedback loops.
We also investigated whether rapamycin is capable of
inducing eIF4E phosphorylation in the absence of Sin1, a
crucial component of mTORC2 [28]. Using Sin1-/- mouse
embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) [28, 29] we found that
rapamycin still induced phosphorylation of eIF4E on Ser209 in the absence of Sin1 (Fig. 2D). Altogether, these
results indicated that the increase in eIF4E phosphorylation
in response to rapamycin is independent of p70-S6K and
Sin1/mTORC2 activity and is not dependent on inhibition
of a conventional negative feedback loop.
Previous work has shown that phosphorylation
of eIF4E on Ser-209 is mediated by Mnk1 and Mnk2,
which are effectors of the Erk1/2 and/or p38 MAPK
pathways [30]. To define which components of the MAPK
pathway are required for rapamycin-dependent eIF4E
phosphorylation in medulloblastoma cells, we treated
Daoy cells with a panel of protein kinase inhibitors to
disrupt MAPK signaling and investigated induction of
eIF4E phosphorylation under these conditions. Inhibition
of MAPK pathway components by the MEK inhibitor
U0126, the p38 MAPK inhibitor SB203580, or the Rsk1
inhibitor BI-D1870, failed to inhibit rapamycin-induced
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

eIF4E phosphorylation (Fig. 3). This suggests that
rapamycin induces eIF4E phosphorylation independently
of MAPKs. As there is evidence that Mnk activity is
required for rapamycin-induced eIF4E phosphorylation
in leukemia cells [17, 18], we determined whether Mnks
are required. Rapalog-dependent eIF4E phosphorylation
was blocked by the Mnk inhibitor CGP57380 (Fig. 4A),
reflecting a requirement for Mnk activity.
There has been previous evidence that MAPKs
activate Mnk1 for inducible phosphorylation of eIF4E,
whereas Mnk2 mainly contributes to eIF4E’s basal,
constitutive phosphorylation [31]. To define whether
rapamycin-induced increase in eIF4E phosphorylation is
mediated by Mnk1 or Mnk2, we knocked down Mnk1
or Mnk2 in Daoy medulloblastoma cells, and examined
the effects of such knockdown on rapamycin-inducible
eIF4E phosphorylation. Rapamycin treatment resulted
in an increase in eIF4E phosphorylation in cells in which
Mnk1 was knocked down, but not in cells with selective

cells were pretreated with DMSO or inhibitors for MEK (U0126,
10 µM), p38 (SB203580, 20 µM), Rsk1 (BI-D1870, 10 µM), for
60 min before addition of rapamycin (20 nM) for 2 hours. Equal
amounts of protein were resolved by SDS-PAGE and processed
by immunoblotting using antibodies for the phosphorylated
forms of eIF4E (pSer-209), p70-S6K (pSer-389) and Akt (pSer473). The blots were stripped and reprobed with antibodies for
eIF4E, p70-S6K, Akt and GAPDH, as indicated.

Mnk2 knockdown (Fig. 4B). These findings suggested that
during treatment of medulloblastoma cells with rapamycin
there is selective activation of Mnk2, but not Mnk1, for
phosphorylation of eIF4E. Similar results were observed in
Mnk knockout MEFs [31, 32], where rapamycin increased
eIF4E phosphorylation in Mnk1-/- MEFs, but failed to do
so in Mnk2-/- or Mnk1/2-/- MEFs (Fig. 4C).
In subsequent studies, we sought to determine
whether combined treatment of medulloblastoma cells
with Mnk and mTOR inhibitors results in enhanced
antineoplastic effects. Daoy cells were treated with the
Mnk inhibitor CGP57380 and either rapamycin or OSI-

027, and cells were subjected to cell viability assays.
Increasing concentrations of CGP57380 alone only
marginally inhibited cell proliferation in these cells (Fig.
5A). However, when CGP57380 was combined with
increasing concentrations of rapamycin, it enhanced
rapamycin’s antiproliferative effect in a dose-dependent
manner (Fig. 5A, upper panel). By contrast, CGP57380
failed to enhance the antiproliferative effects of increasing
concentrations of OSI-027 (Fig. 5A, lower panel). Similar
results were obtained when cell counts were used (Fig.
5B). Taken together, our results suggest that selective
mTORC1 inhibition in medulloblastoma cells results in

(20 nM) and/or CGP57380 (10 µM) for 90 min. Equal amounts of protein were processed by immunoblotting using antibodies for the

engagement of a Mnk2-dependent survival mechanism
that can be counteracted by concomitant Mnk inhibition.
In studies in which the effects of combination therapies on
anchorage-independent growth of Daoy medulloblastoma
cells were assessed, we found enhanced effects by the
combinations of mTOR and Mnk inhibitors (Fig. 5C).
Knockdown of Mnk2, but not Mnk1, using specific
siRNAs enhanced rapamycin-dependent inhibition of
anchorage-independent growth, as compared to rapamycin
alone. (Fig. 5D).
We also tested the effects of Mnk inhibition in

another medulloblastoma cell line, D556. The combination
of rapamycin with CGP57380 inhibited anchorageindependent malignant colony formation more than
either drug alone (Fig. 6A). It should be noted that the
D556 cell line was very sensitive to Mnk inhibition, as
CGP57380 reduced colony formation to 9.2% (Fig.
6A), and knockdown of either Mnk1 or Mnk2 alone
substantially reduced colony formation in D556 cells
(siMnk1: 70.46%; siMnk2: 67.49%) (Fig. 6B). Both
pharmacological inhibition of Mnks, or knockdown of
Mnk1 or Mnk2, increased the sensitivity to rapamycin

(Fig. 6). Knockdown of Mnk1 and Mnk2 in control
(DMSO) cells resulted in similar inhibition of colony
formation (Fig. 6B). Importantly, when combined with
rapamycin treatment, knockdown of Mnk2, but not Mnk1,
resulted in greatly impaired ability to form colonies in soft
agar (Fig. 6B). Noteworthy, in both medulloblastoma cell
lines (Daoy and D556) knockdown of Mnk2 had a stronger
inhibitory effect on colony formation than knockdown
of Mnk1. Taken together, these findings indicate that in
both medulloblastoma lines, simultaneous inhibition of
the mTOR and Mnk pathways results in substantially
enhanced inhibition of anchorage-independent growth of
malignant cells.

cancer cells [20].
Our studies also indicated that rapalog-induced
eIF4E phosphorylation is mediated by Mnks independently
of the canonical Mnk-activating pathway mediated by
MAPKs [19]. While the exact mechanism by which
rapamycin activates eIF4E in this context remains to be
precisely defined, we found that this event is mediated by
Mnk2 and not by Mnk1. It should be noted that another
recent study employed a mass spectrometric approach
and found that rapamycin alters phosphorylation of Mnk2
on Ser-437 in prostate cancer cells, triggering Mnk2
activation and eIF4E phosphorylation independently of
MAPKs [35]. Our findings suggest a similar mechanism
in medulloblastoma cells, as demonstrated by experiments
demonstrating that Mnk2, but not Mnk1, is essential for
rapamycin-induced eIF4E phosphorylation in Daoy cells.
The results of our studies raise the potential for
concomitant targeting of Mnk2 as a means to enhance the
antineoplastic effect of rapalogs in medulloblastoma. The
Mnk inhibitor CGP57380 increased the antiproliferative
effect of rapamycin, and significantly reduced colony
formation in combination with either rapamycin or OSI027. Molecular characterization of the Daoy cell line has
revealed a global activation of Hh pathway genes including
Shh, Gli family and Ptch1, as well as overexpression of
Bmi1 [36]. Thus, Daoy cells likely represent the SHH
subgroup of medulloblastomas. To investigate whether
the combination of mTOR and Mnk inhibition might be
similarly effective in other medulloblastoma subgroups
we extended our analysis by including D556 cells, which
exhibit amplified MYCC [37]. As compared to Daoy cells,

DISCUSSION
There has been prior evidence that rapalogs
exhibit antitumor effects against medulloblastoma cells,
raising the potential for clinical use in the treatment of
this malignancy [33, 34]. Here, we investigated the
mechanisms by which rapamycin increases eIF4E
phosphorylation in Daoy medulloblastoma cells and the
relevance of this phosphorylation in counter-acting its
antineoplastic effects. We found that rapalog-induced
eIF4E phosphorylation is independent of 4E-BP1. We
also found that rapamycin-induced eIF4E phosphorylation
is not mediated by mTORC2 through negative feedback
regulation, because it is independent of p70-S6K and Sin1/
mTORC2. This finding is in agreement with a previous
study demonstrating that rapamycin induces eIF4E
phosphorylation independently of Rictor/mTORC2 in lung

D556 cells were very sensitive to Mnk inhibition by both
pharmacological inhibition and RNAi and, similar to
Daoy cells, CGP57380 increased rapamycin’s inhibitory
effect on colony formation in D556 cells. Knockodwn
of Mnk1 and Mnk2 reduced colony formation to similar
levels in DMSO treated cells. However, in combination
with rapamycin, knockdown of Mnk2 inhibited colony
formation significantly more potently than knockdown
of Mnk1, indicating a Mnk2 specific role in rapamycin
activated negative feedback regulatory loops. Importantly,
in both medulloblastoma cell lines (Shh-subgroup and
subgroup 3) the targeted inhibition of Mnk2 potently
increased the antineoplastic action of rapamycin, likely
by preventing activation of the Mnk2-eIF4E survival
pathway. Thus Mnk inhibition might be a promising anticancer strategy in these medulloblastoma subgroups. This
finding is important because group 3 medulloblastomas
have the worst prognosis of all four subgroups and new
efficient targeted approaches are needed [38]. It should
be noted that targeting the Mnk pathway represents an
attractive target for the treatment of these cancers because
Mnk activity – while being necessary for eIF4E-mediated
oncogenic transformation – is dispensable for normal
development [31].

RNA oligonucleotides (Dharmacon, Lafayette, CO)
directed to Mnk1 (SMARTpool L-004879-00-0005) and
Mnk2 (SMARTpool L-004908-0005). For transfection,
Lipofectamine RNAiMAX Reagent (Invitrogen,
Carlsbad, CA) was used, according to the manufacturer’s
instructions.

Cell Lysis and Immunoblotting
Cells were treated, lysed in phosphorylation lysis
buffer containing protease and phosphatase inhibitors, and
prepared for immunoblotting as in our previous studies
[29, 39].

Cell Viability/Proliferation Assays
Experiments using the 3-(4,5-dimethyl-2-thiazolyl)2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) methodology
were carried out using the Cell Proliferation Reagent
(WST-1) assay kit (Roche, Mannheim, Germany)
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. In brief, for
Daoy and D556 cells, 2000 cells per well were seeded in a
96-well plate and incubated with the indicated inhibitors.
After 5 days, 10% (v/v) WST-1 reagent was added to
each well and absorbance at 450nm was analyzed (using
absorbance at 600nm as a reference wavelength), using
an Epoch Plate reader and Gen5 software from BioTek
Instruments Inc. For proliferation, cells were counted
using an automated cell counter (Scepter, Millipore).

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell Lines, Reagents and Antibodies
Daoy and D556 medulloblastoma cells were
maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% (v/v)
fetal bovine serum and antibiotics at 37˚C in 5% CO2.
Immortalized Mnk1/2+/+, Mnk1-/-, Mnk2-/-, Mnk1/2/, Sin1+/+ and Sin1-/- MEFs were grown in DMEM
supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum

Colony Formation Assay/Anchorage-Independent
Cell Growth
For investigation of anchorage-independent cell
growth soft-agar assays were performed using the
CytoSelect 96-Well Cell Transformation Assay Kit (Cell
Biolabs, Inc.) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
In brief, 2500 cells per well were seeded in soft-agar in
a 96-well plate and incubated at 37˚C in 5% CO2 with
the indicated inhibitors. For siRNA experiments, cells
were transfected with the indicated siRNAs 2 days prior
to seeding equal cell numbers into the 96-well format
in soft-agar, followed by drug treatment. After 7 days,
agar was solubilized and cells were lysed according to
the manufacturer’s instructions. Colony formation was
quantified using the fluorescent cell stain CyQUANT GR
Dye (Cell Biolabs Inc.) in the Synergy HT Plate reader
using Gen5 software from BioTek Instruments Inc.

Quantitative Real Time PCR
Cellular mRNA was reverse-transcribed into
cDNA using the Omniscript TR kit and oligo(dT) primer
(Qiagen) as in our previous studies [41]. Quantitative PCR
