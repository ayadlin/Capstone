in the mammary gland is understood to be an important factor in
the development of breast cancer.
The advent of techniques enabling genome-wide interrogation of
regulation of gene expression has given rise to a proliferation of
studies profiling the transcriptional response to 17hE2 in cultured
cell model systems, most notably MCF-7 cells (2–11). Although
these studies have identified large numbers of regulated genes
across a variety of ligand treatment time points, substantial
divergence exists among them as to the specific core gene
expression signature generated by 17hE2 in this cell type (12).
This highlights the importance of developing methods to integrate
findings across studies, such as meta-analysis. One of the goals of
the Nuclear Receptor Signaling Atlas (NURSA) Bioinformatics
Resource is to supplement traditional models of distribution of
scientific information with freely accessible Web-based resources
designed to allow the bench researcher to intuitively and routinely
integrate information across existing high content datasets. Here,
we describe a weighted meta-analysis that harnesses the combined
statistical power of existing public, independent microarray
datasets to arrive at a consensus gene list—a meta-signature—for
17hE2 treatment of MCF-7 cells. We also describe an accompanying web resource, Gene Expression MetaSignatures (GEMS)6,
which makes the results of our meta-analysis available to the
community as a convenient, intuitive interface.

Abstract
With large amounts of public expression microrray data being
generated by multiple laboratories, it is a significant task
for the bench researcher to routinely identify available
datasets, and then to evaluate the collective evidence across
these datasets for regulation of a specific gene in a given
system. 17B-Estradiol stimulation of MCF-7 cells is a widely
used model in the growth of breast cancer. Although myriad
independent studies have profiled the global effects of this
hormone on gene expression in these cells, disparate experimental variables and the limited power of the individual
studies have combined to restrict the agreement between them
as to the specific gene expression signature elicited by this
hormone. To address these issues, we have developed a freely
accessible Web resource, Gene Expression MetaSignatures
(GEMS) that provides the user a consensus for each gene in
the system. We conducted a weighted meta-analysis encompassing over 13,000 genes across 10 independent published
datasets addressing the effect of 17B-estradiol on MCF-7 cells
at early (3–4 hours) and late (24 hours) time points. In a
literature survey of 58 genes previously shown to be regulated
by 17B-estradiol in MCF-7 cells, the meta-analysis combined
the statistical power of the underlying datasets to call
regulation of these genes with nearly 85% accuracy ( false
discovery rate–corrected P < 0.05). We anticipate that with
future expression microarray dataset contributions from
investigators, GEMS will evolve into an important resource
for the cancer and nuclear receptor signaling communities.

Materials and Methods
Differential gene expression analysis. Differential gene expression was
determined at 2 time points: ‘‘early’’ (3- to 4-h 17hE2 treatment) and ‘‘late’’ (24-h
17hE2 treatment). Each dataset was processed separately using the linear
modeling functions from the limma BioC software package (13). Empirical
Bayes moderated t tests were used to compare 17hE2 treated samples to their
vehicle controls as described (14). P values from each dataset were corrected
for multiple testing by controlling the false discovery rate (FDR; ref. 15).
Meta-analysis of the 17B-E2 expression signature. For the metaanalysis, each dataset was reduced to the probe sets held in common between
the Affymetrix Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 and Human Genome U133A
GeneChip arrays. To obtain a single cumulative measure for each probe set
indicative of differential gene expression surveyed across all the datasets, we
applied the weighted Z method developed by Mosteller and Bush (16) and by
Liptak (17). Briefly, for each probeset, the set of observed t statistics from each
dataset are converted to corresponding standard normal deviates (same
percentile) and combined using the following formula:

Introduction
17h-Estradiol (17hE2) exerts profound effects on gene expression and cellular function in a wide variety of reproductive,
musculoskeletal, neuronal, and metabolic tissues. The mechanism
of action of 17hE2 encompasses (a) genomic actions through
estrogen receptors (ER) bound to cognate response elements in
their target genes, (b) trans-interactions of 17hE2-bound ERs with
other transcription factors, and (c) cross-talk of the ligand with
rapid signaling cascades originating in the cytoplasm with end
points in both the cytoplasm and nucleus (1). The action of 17hE2

Results
Time point selection and dataset normalization. Extensive
MEDLINE and GEO surveys identified two time points most
commonly selected by investigators in the field studying the effects
of 17hE2 on gene expression in MCF-7 cells: 3 to 4 hours of treatment
with 17hE2 (here designated ‘‘early’’) and 24 hours of treatment
(here designated ‘‘late’’). Because two of the studies contributed
datasets to both the early and late meta-analyses, five datasets were
used for the early analysis and seven datasets were used for the late
analysis (Supplementary Table S1). The two time points were
analyzed entirely independently of each other throughout.
Of the 10 studies selected for meta-analysis, raw microarray
intensity data were unavailable for 5, which necessitated the use of
the normalized probeset expression values submitted to GEO by
the investigator (Table 1). Fortunately, 9 of the 10 studies provided
normalized expression values calculated using 1 of 2 related
methods: the Robust Multi-Array Average (RMA) method or the
closely related Guanine Cytosine Robust Multi-Array Analysis
(GCRMA) method. In an effort to standardize the processing steps
as much as possible between all of the studies in the meta-analysis,
we did not attempt to recalculate normalized probeset expression
values for the 10 studies and used the RMA/GCRMA normalized
expression values provided by the investigators. In this way,
all but one study was processed using either RMA or GCRMA
(Supplementary Table S1).
Principal component analysis. Before differential expression
analysis between the 17hE2-treated arrays and their respective
vehicle treated controls, principal component analysis (PCA) was
done with both the early and late time point datasets (Fig. 1 and
Supplementary Fig. S1, respectively). As seen in Fig. 1 and
Supplementary Fig. S1, the largest source of variance between
datasets can be attributed to the ‘‘laboratory’’ effect for both the
early and late time points, a general phenomenon for microarrays
identified by a recent large-scale study (18). Potential contributing
factors to the observed laboratory effect may be the variety of
17hE2 doses used, variations in the MCF-7 cells themselves, and at

least six distinct cell culture protocols (Supplementary Table S1).
However, when each of the 10 datasets was analyzed independently, the 17hE2 treatment effect is the largest source of variance
for the majority of the 10 studies in the meta-analysis (Supplementary Fig. S2A and B). Rather than attempt to correct for the
laboratory effects, we analyzed each study dataset separately for
differential gene expression before meta-analysis. Given that
incremental changes in expression of a gene repeated across
multiple independent datasets might actually reflect a real
biological effect, the filtering out of probe sets showing marginal
variability in expression was omitted.
Study relationship analysis. We set out first to determine the
extent of overlap, in terms of regulated genes, between the
independent datasets. Using a fold change (FC) cutoff of 2 and a
FDR-corrected P value (referred to from here on as the q value) of
<0.05, both of which are commonly accepted variables in microarray analysis, zero (0) differentially expressed genes were
identified by all of the independent datasets at either time point.
Moreover, relaxing the q value cutoff to 0.2 resulted in only a
modest increase in the number of genes in this intersection
(data not shown here but available for download from the GEMS
Web site). This initial result indicated that given the extent in
variation across the datasets, traditional Venn analysis would be of
limited use in arriving at a consensus gene expression response for
17hE2 in MCF-7 cells.
Meta-analysis. Within each study, the differential expression
analysis produced a set of t stats for each probeset indicative of
17hE2 action. For the meta-analysis, each study dataset was
reduced to the set of probesets held in common across the
Affymetrix U133 GeneChip family. This resulted in paring each
study dataset to a core of 22,277 common array features,
representing f13,000 genes. We next used an algorithm to
construct a 17hE2/MCF-7 gene expression metasignature based
on combining appropriately weighted evidence (t stats) across all
of the studies at the early and late time points. Using the weighted

pS2/TFF1, which has both high FCs in the independent datasets
and a very low combined q value, evidence for differential expression is much more reliable.
We next set out to evaluate the performance of GEMS in calling
regulation of experimentally identified 17hE2-responsive genes in
MCF-7 cells. Because a statistically rigorous experimental validation
was not feasible, we first carried out a MEDLINE literature survey to
identify a set of genes that had been shown to be quantitatively
regulated by 17h-E2 in MCF-7 cells at either of the two time points in
our meta-analysis. The list of genes is shown in Supplementary Table
S3. We evaluated the FC range and combined q values assigned to
these genes by GEMS. GEMS used the combined statistical power of
the underlying datasets to call regulation (combined q value < 0.05)
of these genes with nearly 85% accuracy. For comparison, Fisher’s
method identified 70% correctly, and the overlap between the studies
is 100%, i.e., all of the genes identified by Fisher are identified by the
weighted-Z method (data not shown).

Z method at a combined q value of <0.05, our meta-analysis
identified a 17hE2/MCF-7 metasignature of 2,313 unique Entrez
Gene IDs at 3 to 4 hours (early) and 4,144 unique Entrez Gene IDs
at 24 hours (late). The results are summarized in Table 2, where the
early and late metasignature genes are binned according to a
number of different individual dataset fold change (FC) criteria,
from no FC criteria to FC of z2 in all datasets. Full gene lists from
Table 2 are provided in Supplementary Table S2. The lower the
combined q value for a given gene, the greater the weight of
cumulative evidence across all the independent datasets for
regulation in this system. As reference points, pS2/TFF1 and MYC
are two genes whose robust 17hE2 regulation in MCF-7 cells has
been indisputably confirmed using quantitative techniques such as
Northern hybridization and quantitative real-time PCR. At the 24
hours (late) time point, these genes have combined q values of 4.78
 1017 and 2.62  1011, respectively.
GEMS Web resource. To enhance the utility of our metaanalysis as a research resource, we have designed a Web interface,
GEMS, that enables the user to rapidly and conveniently evaluate
the 17hE2/MCF-7 gene expression metasignature on a gene-bygene basis. The 17hE2/MCF-7 GEMS is freely accessible and
located on the NURSA Web site.6
The version to which this paper refers (v 1.0) provides for
querying the 17hE2/MCF-7 metasignature for a specific gene. For
the gene name or symbol entered, GEMS displays, by default, a
simple view showing (a) the fold regulation range across
independent datasets and (b) the combined q value, a measure
of the collective evidence gleaned from the independent datasets
pointing to that gene being differentially regulated. Both values
should be given due consideration when evaluating the possibility
of differential expression for that gene. For example, a gene can
have negligible FCs in the independent datasets and yet have a
highly significant combined q value resulting from low variability
within the replicates of each dataset. Conversely, a gene can
have high FCs in the independent datasets but a high combined
q value resulting from high variability within the replicates of
the independent datasets. In both these scenarios, evidence for
differential expression is questionable. In contrast, for a historical,
quantitatively validated 17hE2 target in MCF-7 cells, such as

Discussion
As expression microarray studies have been published in
increasing numbers, it has become clear that this technique is
particularly sensitive to variations in protocol, and independent
laboratories continue to yield discrepant datasets, even in
experimental systems as robust and well-characterized as that of
17hE2 in MCF-7 cells. The field until now has lacked a resource
that allows the bench researcher unfamiliar with advanced
microarray analysis to routinely avail of an objective weighting of
these datasets to help determine the response of a specific gene or
gene network to 17hE2 in these cells.
It is not our intent with this study to call into question any of the
gene lists arising from the published datasets selected for metaanalysis, all of which are valid observations under their own
prevailing experimental conditions. Rather, our study is an attempt
to reconcile the disparate observations made by these studies and
arrive at a statistical consensus for the system by leveraging the
increased statistical power afforded by combining independent
datasets in a single meta-analysis. By opening the results of our
meta-analysis to query through a freely accessible Web resource,
GEMS, we hope to provide the field with a convenient resource to
fully exploit these datasets.
GEMS is not intended as a static entity and will be improved by
the incorporation of future suitable expression microarray datasets,
and we welcome all contributions from the community. Moreover,
the anticipated development of platforms with increasingly
comprehensive genome coverage, and improved sensitivity in data
capture and analysis, will also serve to hone the accuracy of GEMS.
That said, it should be noted that certain conditions for individual
studies may result in the identification of bona fide targets specific
to those conditions that would not be identified by the metaanalysis.
Traditional models of scientific publication do not readily afford
the bench researcher convenient access for mining of high content
datasets. As a result these datasets in many cases fail to realize
their full potential as research resources. The volume of gene
regulation data in the field is reaching a point where there are
reasonable grounds for organizing independent datasets as a
whole, and applying statistical approaches to identify biological
trends that are sufficiently robust to efface the experimental
variables characteristic of each individual dataset. Backed by the
collective contributions of researchers in this field, we anticipate
