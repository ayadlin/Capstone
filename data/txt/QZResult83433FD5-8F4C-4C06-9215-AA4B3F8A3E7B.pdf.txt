ABSTRACT
Oral and oropharyngeal cancers are the sixth most common cancers worldwide.
Despite intensive investigation, oral squamous cell carcinomas (OSCC) represent a
clinical challenge resulting in significant morbidity and mortality. Resistance to cell
death is common in OSCC and is often mediated by the Bcl-2 family proteins. Among
all anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family members, Mcl-1 functions as a major survival factor,
particularly in solid cancers. Despite the confirmed importance of Mcl-1 in several
neoplasms, the role of Mcl-1 in OSCC survival has yet to be explored. In this study,
we found that knocking down Mcl-1 sensitized OSCC cells to ABT-737, which binds to
Bcl-2/Bcl-xL but not Mcl-1. We report for the first time that a BH3 mimetic, Sabutoclax,
which functions as an inhibitor of all anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 proteins, induced cancerspecific cell death in an Mcl-1-dependent manner through both apoptosis and toxic
mitophagy. In vivo studies demonstrated that Sabutoclax alone decreased tumor
growth in a carcinogen-induced tongue OSCC mouse model. In a combination regimen,
Sabutoclax and COX-2 inhibitor, Celecoxib, synergistically inhibited the growth of
OSCC in vitro and also significantly reduced OSCC tumor growth in vivo. Overall, these
results identify Mcl-1 as a therapeutic prospective target in OSCC.

are the major risk factors for OSCC. Oral carcinogenesis
occurs through two major pathways: I) transformation of
normal epithelium to dysplastic lesions and II) progression
of these dysplastic lesions to invasive squamous
carcinomas. These transformation events are mediated
by the dysfunction of multiple genes, including the Bcl-2
family members and Cyclooxygenases [3].
Bcl-2 family proteins play a critical role in the
progression of various neoplasms. The Bcl-2 family can
be broadly divided into anti-apoptotic and pro-apoptotic

INTRODUCTION
Oral cancer and oropharyngeal cancers are now
considered common cancers with an estimated 2.23 million
deaths in 2008 [1]. Annually, 40, 000 new cases of oral
cancer are reported in the United States whereas in India
the incidence is approximately 80, 000 per year. More
than 90% of all oral cancers are Oral Squamous Cell
Carcinomas (OSCC) [2]. Poor habits like smoking and
consumption of smokeless tobacco (gutkha and betel nut)

members. The anti-apoptotic proteins (Bcl-2, Bcl-xL,
Mcl-1, Bcl-w and A1) contain BH1 to BH4 domains.
The pro-apoptotic members are further divided into two
subgroups. One group (Bax and Bak) contains BH1 to
BH3 domains and the other group (NOXA, PUMA, Bim
and Bid) contains only the BH3 domain [4]. Among
the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family members, Mcl-1 plays
a major role in tumorigenesis and chemoresistance,
particularly in solid cancers [5, 6], distinguishing it
as a potentially important therapeutic target. In spite
of significant efforts to develop inhibitors of the antiapoptotic Bcl-2 proteins, many of those developed to date
only effectively inhibit Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL, but not Mcl1. Most such inhibitors fall into the class of compounds
known as BH3 mimetics, which are small molecules that
mimic the BH3 domain of pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 proteins.
One currently used BH3 mimetic, ABT-737 and its
clinical counterpart ABT-263, display-limited affinity
towards Mcl-1 [7]. This could be attributed to the unique
structure of Mcl-1 as compared to Bcl-2 or Bcl-xL [8].
Using NMR binding assays and computational studies,
an Apogossypol derivative, Sabutoclax, was identified
and found to bind to Bcl-xL, Bcl-2, and Mcl-1 with IC50
values of 190, 360, and 520 nmol/L, respectively [9].
We have previously shown that the Mcl-1 antagonist
Sabutoclax alone or in combination with the tumor
suppressor mda-7/IL-24 induces cancer-specific cell death
in human prostate carcinomas (PC) [9, 10]. Furthermore,
Sabutoclax alone inhibited both primary tumor growth as
well as the metastatic spread of castration-resistant PC
in transgenic mice that spontaneously develop prostate
adenocarcinomas [11]. Interestingly, it was also found
that Sabutoclax enhanced sensitivity to tyrosine kinase
inhibitors in leukemia stem cells, whose survival is mostly
dependent upon expression of the Bcl-2 family of antiapoptotic proteins [12].
Earlier studies evaluating the clinicopathological
association of Mcl-1 with OSCC showed that Mcl-1
overexpression in OSCC is predominantly associated with
a less favorable outcome [13]. Similarly, it was found that
the HDAC inhibitor vorinostat sensitizes HNSCC cells to
ABT-737-induced cell death by down regulating Mcl-1
[14]. Based on these reports, we hypothesized that Mcl-1
could be a major survival factor in OSCC. In this study,
we report for the first time that pharmacological inhibition
of Mcl-1 using Sabutoclax induced cancer-specific cell
death in OSCC both in vitro and in vivo. Cell death was
attributed to Bak-mediated apoptosis and Bnip3-(BCL2/
adenovirus E1B 19 kDa protein-interacting protein 3)
induced mitophagy. As combination therapy is extremely
important for the successful treatment of cancer, we
explored additional agents of potential benefit to combine
with Sabutoclax in OSCC. Previous literature in OSCC
clearly showed an important role for COX-2 in OSCC
tumor development and progression. For this reason,

www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

we evaluated Sabutoclax in combination with a COX-2
inhibitor, Celecoxib, and found that this novel combination
synergistically inhibited the growth of OSCC both in vitro
and in vivo. These studies reinforce the importance of
Mcl-1 in OSCC and provide preclinical data in support of
Sabutoclax and Celecoxib as a potential OSCC therapy.

RESULTS
Knocking down Mcl-1 sensitizes human OSCC
cells to ABT-737-induced cell death
To determine whether Mcl-1 is a key survival
factor in OSCC, we knocked down Mcl-1 genetically
and with pharmacological inhibitors in the human
OSCC line H357 and measured cell death in response
to ABT-737. H357 cells transfected with control siRNA
(siControl) were not affected even at higher doses of
ABT-737 after 8-hour of treatment (Fig. 1A left panel).
On the contrary, Mcl-1 siRNA (siMcl-1)-transfected
cells showed a significant reduction in cell viability in
response to ABT-737. Next, we performed cell death
assays at 8-hours post-treatment and found that siMcl1-transfected cells showed significantly higher cell death
as compared to siControl-transfected cells (Fig. 1A right
panel). Furthermore, we analyzed apoptosis markers by
immunoblotting and found that siMcl-1-transfected H357
cells showed upregulated NOXA along with enhanced
cleaved PARP, caspase-3 and caspage-9 (Fig. 1B).
For pharmacological inhibition of Mcl-1, we used 4-HPR
(N - (4-Hydroxyphenyl) Retinamide), which downregulates
Mcl-1 expression [15]. We evaluated the combinatorial
cell death effect of ABT-737 and 4-HPR, where we found
4-HPR and ABT-737 synergistically induced cell death
(CI < 1) in H357 cells (Fig. 1C left and right panels). In
the combinatorial treatment group, there was increased
expression of Bax, NOXA and enhanced PARP cleavage
indicating the induction of apoptosis as compared to single
agent treatment (Fig. 1D). Overall, our data suggests that
OSCC cell survival is dependent on Mcl-1, but not on other
anti-apoptotic proteins.

Mcl-1 antagonist Sabutoclax induces
cancer-specific cell death in OSCC
Assuming that Mcl-1 could function as a principal
survival protein in OSCC; we treated human OSCC H357
cells with the Mcl-1 antagonist Sabutoclax or ABT-737 in
a dose-dependent manner for 48 hours and determined cell
death. We observed that Sabutoclax induced cell death at
a much lower dose as compared to ABT-737 (Fig. 2A) in
H357 cells. We also found increased levels of activated
Bak with Sabutoclax treatment as compared to ABT-737
treatment (insert Fig. 2A). This is important as Bak
remains bound to Mcl-1, which prevents its pro-apoptotic

actions. Next we analyzed the expression pattern of the
anti-apoptotic proteins in a panel of human OSCC lines
(SCC-4, SCC-9 and H357) and their normal counterpart
HOK. FaDU is a human oropharynx SCC cell line. All
the OSCC cells and FaDu expressed elevated amounts
of Mcl-1 as compared to HOK, although SCC-4 and
SCC-9 showed low levels of Mcl-1 expression as compared
to FaDu and H357. Interestingly, with the exception of
SCC-4, most SCC cells showed negligible expression of
Bcl-2 (Fig. 2B insert). Additionally, dose-dependent cell
viability assays were performed with all of the cell lines
after treatment with Sabutoclax for 48 hours. The data
suggest that Sabutoclax-induced cancer-specific reduction
in cell viability occurs in a Mcl-1-dependent manner
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

(Fig. 2B). FaDU and H357 cells, which have the highest
levels of Mcl-1, also showed the greatest sensitivity to
Sabutoclax. Interestingly, we found that FaDu cells have
slightly less Mcl-1 expression as compared to H357 and
were more responsive to Sabutoclax. This might be due to
barely detectable Bcl-xL expression in FaDu cells (Fig. 2B
insert). HOK, whose basal expression of Mcl-1 was
low, was found to be least sensitive to Sabutoclax.
Immunoblotting was performed to study dose-dependent
effects of Sabutoclax on induction of intrinsic apoptosis in
SCC-4, SCC-9, H357 and FaDU cells. Sabutoclax treatment
resulted in increased expression of NOXA along with
enhanced cleavage of PARP and caspase-3 in all cell lines
(Fig. 2C).

Sabutoclax induces selective degradation of
mitochondria by autophagy

(Fig. 3B). Interestingly, autophagy inhibition by 3MA
could protect H357 cells from Sabutoclax-induced
reduction of cell viability (Fig. 3C). Similarly, when
ATG-5 was knocked down using siRNA in H357 cells,
Sabutoclax-induced LC3-I to LC3-II conversion was
inhibited. Additionally, knock down of ATG-5 rescued the
Sabutoclax-induced reduction of cell viability. These data
confirm a role of ATG-5 in Sabutoclax-induced autophagy
(Fig. 3D).
To investigate the physiological role of autophagy
in Sabutoclax-induced toxicity, a human autophagy
PCR array was evaluated (SA Bioscience) using mockand Sabutoclax-treated FaDU cells (Supplementary
Fig. S1). Results showed significant upregulation
of Bnip3, a Bcl-2 family protein that is considered
to have pro-apoptotic activity and that is a Hif-1αinduced gene [17]. Interestingly, it is reported that
Bnip3 induces mitophagy as its N-terminal domain

It has been established previously that
Mcl-1 inactivation leads to induction of autophagy [16].
Therefore, we wanted to determine if Sabutoclax could
induce autophagy in OSCC. Sabutoclax treatment in
H357 cells resulted in the formation LC3-GFP punctate
staining as demonstrated via confocal microscopy (Fig. 3A
left panel). We also performed flow cytometry with
H357 and found that MDC staining was more intense in
Sabutoclax-treated H357 cells, confirming that Sabutoclax
induces the formation of autophagolysosome vacuoles in
OSCC cells (Fig. 3A right panel). Next, we performed
immunoblotting for autophagy markers to support these
observations, where we found that treatment of H357
cells with Sabutoclax resulted in an increased conversion
of LC3-I to LC3-II and upregulated ATG-5 expression

hooks itself to the mitochondria, whereas its C-terminal
domain has an LC3 interacting region (LIR) that binds
to LC3 in autophagosomes [18]. We confirmed our
PCR array data in H357 cells, which showed that
Sabutoclax upregulated Bnip3 and Hif-1α in both a
time- and dose-dependent manner (Fig. 4A & 4B).
Additionally, knocking down Bnip3 could rescue H357
cells from Sabutoclax-induced reduction of cell viability
(Fig. 4C). Next, we performed confocal microscopy
to detect mitophagy in Sabutoclax-treated H357 cells.
Results showed that mitophagy induction was observed
in the siControl-transfected group, which was not evident

in the siBnip3-transfected group (Fig. 4D). In this
experiment, all groups were co-transfected with LC3-GFP
and siBnip3 followed by treatment with Sabutoclax. At
the end of the experiment the mitochondria were stained
with CM-ROX mitotracker red. The Sabutoclax-treated
siControl group showed a significant level of mitophagy
(the yellow dots indicate mitophagy), whereas siBnip3transfected cells showed reduced mitophagy. Furthermore,
our immunoprecipitation data suggest that treatment of
H357 cells with Sabutoclax leads to the interaction of
Bnip3 with LC3 thus inducing Bnip3-mediated mitophagy
(Fig. 4E).

Mcl-1 antagonist inhibits tumor growth in a

lysates derived from these tumors showed that Bnip3 and
Hif-1α were marginally elevated in several Sabutoclaxtreated tongue tumors (Fig. 5D). In addition, we found
increased expression of NOXA, cleaved caspase-3 and
cleaved caspase-9 were upregulated in several of the
Sabutoclax-treated tumors indicating induction of apoptosis.

in a nude mouse xenograft model using the human SCC

sublethal doses of Sabutoclax (3 mg/kg) and Celecoxib

combination therapies is critical to successfully eradicate
human cancer. Due to a large basis of literature supporting
the role of COX-2 in OSCC development and progression
[19, 20], we chose to evaluate a COX-2 inhibitor,
Celecoxib, in combination with Sabutoclax. In vitro,
Sabutoclax and Celecoxib synergistically inhibited the
growth of H357 cells, which was demonstrated using cell
viability, colony forming and scratch assays (Fig. 6A, 6B

as Survivin, Stat-3, LIVIN and PON2 (Figure 6D).

DISCUSSION

ABT-737, whereas Mcl-1 antagonist Sabutoclax induced
profound cell death even at low doses. These data suggest
that OSCC cell survival is dependent upon Mcl-1, but
not on Bcl-2 or Bcl-xL. In addition, we found that the
majority of human OSCC cell lines express elevated
amounts of Mcl-1, but negligible amounts of Bcl-2, a
phenomenon recently observed in HNSCC by independent
researchers [14, 25]. Additionally, immunoblotting
was performed to determine the expression of Bcl-2,
Bcl-xL and Mcl-1 in eleven different OSCC patient
tumors. All 11 patient tumors expressed Mcl-1, but only
5 out of 11 patient tumors expressed Bcl-2 at negligible
levels (Supplementary Fig. 2). These data indicate the

BH3 mimetic ABT-737 binds efficiently to
Bcl-2, Bcl-xL and Bcl-w, but shows limited affinity
towards Mcl-1. Preclinical animal studies have suggested
that as a single agent ABT-737 exerts excellent anti-tumor
activity in hematological cancers [21], but most solid
cancers including prostate, breast and colon carcinomas
demonstrate innate resistance against ABT-737 [22–24].
These available reports suggest that hematological cancer
cell survival is Bcl-2-dependent, whereas solid cancers
typically depend more on Mcl-1 for their survival. In
the present study, OSCC showed resistance towards

dependence of OSCC tumor survival on Mcl-1. We found
that Sabutoclax induced cancer-specific cell death in
OSCC in a Mcl-1-dependent manner, which was attributed
to both Bak-induced apoptosis and Bnip3-mediated
mitophagy (Fig. 8). This finding was confirmed by our
observation that the pan-caspase-inhibitor z-VAD-FMK
rescued H357 cells from Sabutoclax-induced reduction
of cell viability (Supplementary Fig. 3A). Additionally,
when Bnip3 was knocked down, the Sabutoclax-induced
loss of mitochondrial membrane potential was not
observed indicating cytotoxic activation of mitophagy
(Supplementary Fig. 3B).
Treatment of OSCC cells with Sabutoclax resulted in
accumulation / up regulation of Hif-1α even in a normoxic
environment, which in turn induced Bnip3-mediated
mitophagy. It was previously established that Hif-1α
is a transcriptional regulator of Bnip3 [26]. Recently,
AT-101 (modified enantiomer of gossypol) was shown to
stabilize Hif-1α protein without any increase in mRNA
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

levels [27]. Furthermore, under normoxic conditions
Hif-1α is spontaneously hydroxylated by prolyl hydroxylase,
an enzyme that requires oxygen and iron to perform its
enzymatic activity. AT-101 treatment caused intracellular
iron chelation and resulted in accumulation of Hif-1α in
nerve sheath tumor cells [27]. In our study, Sabutoclaxinduced Hif-1α, Bnip3 and LC3-II and expression was
blocked significantly when the media was supplemented
with iron in the form of ferric citrate (Supplementary
Fig. 4A). Similarly, Sabutoclax-induced reduction of cell
viability in OSCC was rescued by treatment with ferric
citrate (Supplementary Fig. 4B). Therefore, it is possible
that Sabutoclax, being an Apogossypol derivative, may also
chelate iron in OSCC cells.
COX-2 expression is elevated in various cancers
including head and neck, breast, gastric, hepatocellular and
colorectal carcinomas [19, 28–31]. Additionally, COX-2
activation is an early event in OSCC and is overexpressed
in almost 80% of oral cancer cases [20]. Aberrant regulation

Figure 8: Hypothetical model of action for the anti-tumor activity of Mcl-1 antagonist Sabutoclax in OSCC
cells. Inhibition of Mcl-1 by the BH3 mimetic Sabutoclax in OSCC activates pro-apoptotic proteins that result in release of cytochrome
c into the cytoplasm, which triggers apoptosis. In addition, Sabutoclax triggers Hif-1α induced Bnip3 up regulation in OSCC cells. Bnip3
binds to mitochondria through its N-terminal domain and interacts with LC3 of the autophagosome through LC3 interacting region in the
C-terminus to cause mitophagy, which also contributes to Sabutoclax-mediated cell death in OSCC.

of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) results in an increased
abundance of its principal metabolic product, prostaglandin
E2, which can affect multiple aspects of cancer
development and progression. COX-2 activation leads to
the evasion of apoptosis, angiogenesis and metastasis [28].
Recently, COX-2 activation has been linked with the
development of radioresistance [28]. Considering that
combination therapy may be the most effective strategy of
combating cancer, we decided to evaluate the combinatorial
effect of Sabutoclax with Celecoxib, a COX-2
inhibitor, both in vitro and in vivo. Our data indicate that
the combination of Sabutoclax and Celecoxib inhibits
proliferation signals like Survivin, p-Stat3, PON2 and
LIVIN. PON2 lowers the stress-induced pro-apoptotic
protein CHOP, which contributes to the development
of chemotherapeutic resistance in cancer cells [32].
Livin is a member of the inhibitor of apoptosis protein
(IAP) family, which may sequester SMAC, preventing it
from antagonizing XIAP-mediated inhibition of caspases
(livin). We also found that this novel combination showed
significantly increased inhibition of tumor growth in vivo
as compared to either agent used alone.
Mcl-1 is critical for survival of regulatory T cells
(Treg) [33]. Mice having Treg-specific deletion of Mcl-1
lose Treg cells resulting in autoimmunity [33]. Since the
anti-tumor efficacy of Sabutoclax was evaluated in a
carcinogen-induced OSCC model in BALB/c mice
(Figure 5), it was important to determine the potential
impact of Sabutoclax on T lymphocytes in BALB/c mice.
To address this issue, we performed additional animal
studies where BALB/c animals were treated with vehicle
control or Sabutoclax (1 mg/kg and 3 mg/kg body weight)
IP twice a week for 6 weeks. At the end of the experiment,
all animals were sacrificed and peripheral blood, spleen
and lymph nodes were collected and subjected to
flow cytometry analysis to detect Treg cell populations
(CD3+CD4+ FoxP3+). As evident in Supplementary
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Figure  5 we did not find any significant difference
in Treg cell populations between vehicle control- and
Sabutoclax-treated mice. In addition, we also did not find
any significant difference between CD8+ cell populations
between vehicle control- and Sabutoclax-treated mice
(Supplementary figure 6). These evidences indicate that
Sabutoclax has a minimal impact on Treg cell populations.
Although Sabutoclax inhibits Mcl-1, it may not mimic the
complete knock out of Mcl-1 in the Treg cell populations.
In conclusion, OSCC showed resistance to Bcl-2
antagonist ABT-737, supporting the concept that OSCC
cell survival is dependent upon Mcl-1. The BH3 mimetic
Sabutoclax, which significantly targets Mcl-1 in addition
to the other anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 proteins, induced cancerspecific cell death in OSCC alone or in combination with
Celecoxib. Considering the importance of Mcl-1 in OSCC
survival, our future studies will focus on elucidating the
potential role of Mcl-1 in chemo- and radioresistance of
OSCC. Overall, this study provides important evidence
that highlights Mcl-1 as a potentially viable therapeutic
target in OSCC and also presents evidence of efficacy of
a novel and exciting combination therapy for this disease.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell lines and culture conditions
Human OSCC cell lines H357, SCC-4 and
SCC-9 were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich (collected from
European Collection of Cell Cultures). The human pharynx
squamous cell carcinoma cell line FaDU was obtained
from the American Type Culture Collection. SCC-4 and
SCC-9 cell lines were cultured in Dulbecco’s Modified

recombinant human Bak from which the C-terminal and
transmembrane domains were deleted (Calbiochem).

Assessment of cell viability and cell death
Cell viability was measured by 3-(4,
5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2, 5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide
(MTT; Sigma-Aldrich) assay [35] and cell death was
measured by trypan blue dye exclusion assay as described
earlier [36].

Flow cytometry

Transient transfection and siRNA

The autofluorescent agent Monodansylcadaverine
(MDC, Sigma-Aldrich) was used to measure the
autophagolysosome vacuoles. H357 cells were treated
with the indicated concentration of Sabutoclax. After
48 hour of treatment, cells were incubated with 30 μM
MDC in DMEM/F12 at 37°C for 20 minutes. Cells were
then washed three times with 1X PBS and analyzed by
Flow Cytometry (BD LSRFortessa) at λex 338 nm;
λem 500 nm in UV laser [38]. Mitochondrial membrane
potential was measured by using a cationic dye JC-1
(T3168, Life Technologies), which exhibits potentialdependent accumulation in mitochondria (excitation
at 488 nm and emission at 527 nm). H357 cells were
transfected with either si-Bnip3 or si-control and treated
with the indicated concentration of Sabutoclax for
48 hours. Cells were stained with JC-1 (50 μM) at 37°C
for 30 minutes and monomeric form of JC-1 was analyzed
by flow cytometer (BD FACSCalibur) [39].

Transfection was performed using Lipofectamine
2000 (Life Technologies) according to the manufacturer’s
protocol with plasmid and siRNAs. Control siRNA (DO001210-01-05) and Mcl-1 siRNA (M-004501-08) was
purchased from Thermo Scientific. Bnip3 siRNA was
obtained from Ambion, Life Technologies (4392420).
ATG-5

Monitoring autophagy and mitophagy
LC3-GFP was used to detect autophagy punctate
structures. H357 cells were transfected with LC3GFP for 24 hours in an 8-chamber culture slide (BD
Falcon) and exposed to the indicated concentrations of
Sabutoclax. Confocal microscopy was used to detect
autophagy punctate structures. Rapamycin (0.1 μM)
16633

Oncotarget

was used as a positive control for inducing autophagy.
3-MA (10 mM) and Bafilomycin (0.2 μM) were used
as autophagy inhibitors for this experiment. H357
cells were transfected with si-Bnip3 or si-control and­
co-transfected with LC3-GFP and treated with
the indicated concentrations of Sabutoclax. After
48 hours of treatment, cells were incubated with 30 nM
CM-Rox Mitotraker red (Life Technologies) in DMEM/
F12 medium at 37°C for 20 minutes. Cells were then
washed with 1X PBS and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde
for 15 minutes. Confocal microscopy (LEICA TCS-SP5)
was performed to detect GFP and mitotraker red. The
yellow dots indicate mitophagy.

Drug combination studies
In drug combination studies, Sabutoclax was used
alone or in combination with Celecoxib and ABT-737
alone or combination with 4-HPR (Sigma Aldrich) to treat
H357 cells. Cell viability or cell death was determined by
MTT assay or trypan blue exclusion assay, respectively.
Combination index was determined by Calcusyn software
(Biosoft), using the Chou-Talalay method [40]. Calcusyn
combination index CI < 1 indicates synergism.

In vivo animal model
Institutional Animal Ethics Committee of “Institute
Life Sciences” approved the protocols followed for
conducting experiments on mice. The carcinogen-induced
tongue mouse model experiments were performed
as described earlier by Czerninski et al. with slight
modification [41]. In all experiments, 4 to 6 week-old
female BALB/c mice weighing 20–25 g were used and
4NQO (4-Nitroquinoline 1-oxide, Sigma-Aldrich), which
serves as a surrogate of tobacco exposure, was used as a
carcinogen. Oral administration of 4NQO (50 μg/ml) with
drinking water was applied for 20 weeks, after which all
animals were reverted back to regular water and monitored
for up to 24 weeks. After visible tumors appeared on the
tongues of the mice, animals were randomly divided
in two groups (n = 5 mice / group). One group of mice
were injected intraperitoneally (I.P.) with 3 mg / kg body
weight Sabutoclax (dissolved in ethanol/Cremophor
EL/saline = 10:10:80) and another group of mice were
injected I.P. with vehicle control DMSO, twice a week for
6 weeks. After completion of treatment all animals were
sacrificed and tongue tissue was collected during necropsy.
Whole cell protein was extracted from tongue tumors.

Nude mice xenograft model
FaDU-Luc (FaDU stably transfected with
Luciferase) cells (2 × 106) were used to establish bilateral
subcutaneous tumors on both flanks of 8–10 week old
male athymic nude mice. Studies were performed as
described earlier [10]. Treatment began when tumors
reached ~100-mm3. Sabutoclax was dissolved in a
10:10:80 solution of 100% ethanol:Cremophor:PBS
and administered at a dose of 3 mg/kg. Celecoxib
was dissolved in PBS and administered at a dose of
50 mg/kg. Both drugs were given via I.P. injection three
times per week (n = 5 mice / group) for four weeks. For
in vivo imaging of tumors, the mice were anesthetized and
injected I.P. with 150 mg/kg luciferin and light emitted
from each tumor was determined using a Xenogen system
with CCD camera with an integration time of 1 minute.
Luminescence measurements were made using Living
Image software (version 2.50.1; Xenogen). At the end of
the experiment, animals were sacrificed and the tumors
were removed and the weight was measured.

OSCC sample collection and protein isolation

Assessment of the impact of Sabutoclax on the
T lymphocytes of BALB/c mice

Eleven surgically resected primary OSCC tumors
were collected from the Institute of Dental Sciences,
Bhubaneswar, India. Immediately after collection, tissues
were washed with 1X PBS and homogenized with 0.3 ml
RIPA lysis buffer (containing protease inhibitor cocktail)

For this experiment 8 week-old BALB/c female
mice weighing 20–25 g were used. Animals were
randomly divided in three groups (n = 5 mice per group).
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

One group of mice were injected intraperitonealy (I.P)
with 1 mg / kg, a second group with 3mg/kg body
weight Sabutoclax (dissolved in ethanol/Cremophor EL/
saline = 10:10:80) and a third group of mice were injected
I.P with vehicle control DMSO (dissolved in ethanol/
Cremophor EL/saline = 10:10:80). The injections were
performed twice a week for 6 weeks. After completion
of treatment, all animals were sacrificed and peripheral
blood, spleen and lymph nodes were collected in medium
for further analysis.
Single cell suspension of spleen and lymph nodes
were prepared by a sheer force slide dissociation technique.
RBCs in peripheral blood and splenic cell suspension
were lysed with RBC Lysis buffer (eBioscience). Surface
staining was done with anti-mouse CD3-FITC, antimouse CD4-BUV395 (BD Bioscience), anti-mouse
CD25-PE, anti-mouse CD8-PECy5 (BD Pharmingen)
and Anti-Mouse CD4 PE-Cyanine5 (eBioscience). For
intracellular staining of FoxP3, samples were fixed by
IC-Fixation buffer (eBioscience), permeabilized by
permeabilization buffer (eBioscience) according to the
manufacture’s protocol and stained with anti-mouse
FoxP3-Alexafluor647 (BD Bioscience). Stained cells
were acquired and analyzed by BD FACS DIVA software
in LSR-II flow cytometer (BD Biosciences). Fluorescence
minus one controls were used for specific gating.
