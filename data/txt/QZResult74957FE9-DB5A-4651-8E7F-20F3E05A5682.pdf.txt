Abstract
Primary effusion lymphoma (PEL) is an incurable, aggressive
B-cell malignancy that develops rapid resistance to conventional chemotherapy. In efforts to identify novel approaches to
block proliferation of PEL cells, we found that sanguinarine, a
natural compound isolated from the root plant Sanguinaria
canadendid, inhibits cell proliferation and induces apoptosis
in a dose-dependent manner in several PEL cell lines. Our data
show that sanguinarine treatment of PEL cells results in upregulation of death receptor 5 (DR5) expression via generation
of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and causes activation of
caspase-8 and truncation of Bid (tBid). Subsequently, tBid
translocates to the mitochondria causing conformational
changes in Bax, leading to loss of mitochondrial membrane
potential and release of cytochrome c to the cytosol.
Sanguinarine-induced release of cytochrome c results in
activation of caspase-9 and caspase-3 and poly(ADP-ribose)
polymerase (PARP) cleavage, leading to induction of caspasedependent apoptosis. In addition, we show that pretreatment
of PEL cells with carbobenzoxy-Val-Ala-Asp-fluoromethylketone, a universal inhibitor of caspases, abrogates caspase and
PARP activation and prevents cell death induced by sanguinarine. Moreover, treatment of PEL cells with sanguinarine
down-regulates expression of inhibitor of apoptosis proteins
(IAP). Finally, N-acetylcysteine, an inhibitor of ROS, inhibits
sanguinarine-induced generation of ROS, up-regulation of
DR5, Bax conformational changes, activation of caspase-3,
and down-regulation of IAPs. Taken together, our findings
suggest that sanguinarine is a potent inducer of apoptosis of
PEL cells via up-regulation of DR5 and raise the possibility
that this agent may be of value in the development of novel
therapeutic approaches for the treatment of PEL. [Cancer Res

Introduction
Primary effusion lymphoma (PEL) is a subtype of non-Hodgkin’s
B-cell lymphoma that mainly presents in patients with advanced
AIDS but is sometimes also found in HIV-negative individuals (1, 2).

PEL cells grow as a lymphomatous effusion in body cavities and are
infected with Kaposi’s sarcoma–associated herpes virus [human
herpesvirus (HHV)-8]. Most cases show dual infection with EBV
(HHV-4; ref. 3). Pleural and abdominal effusions from patients with
AIDS-PEL contain a number of cytokines, which serve as autocrine
growth factors (4, 5). For example, interleukin (IL)-10 has been
reported to serve as an autocrine growth factor for AIDS-related
B-cell lymphoma (6). Recently, it has also been shown that PEL
cells use viral IL-6 and IL-10 in an autocrine fashion for their
survival and proliferation (4).
Programmed cell death or apoptosis is a genetically regulated
process, which plays an essential role in the development and
homeostasis of higher organisms (7). Defective apoptosis contributes to the development of many different types of malignancies.
Cell death may be triggered by a wide variety of death signals.
There are two major pathways involved by which apoptosis occurs:
(a) the mitochondrion-initiated pathway, also defined as the
intrinsic pathway, and (b) the cell-surface death receptor pathway,
also defined as the extrinsic pathway (8). In the mitochondrial
pathway, cytochrome c is released from the intramembrane space
to the cytosol. Once released, cytochrome c and dATP bind to
apoptotic protease–activating factor 1 (Apaf-1), and this complex,
along with adenine nucleotides, promotes procaspase-9 autoactivation, which in turn activates caspase-3, ultimately resulting in
PARP cleavage (9). In the death receptor–mediated pathway (e.g.,
TRAIL/TRAIL ligand interaction and cell death), caspase-8 is an
initiator caspase that can activate downstream caspases, including
caspase-3. Active caspase-8 also cleaves a proapoptotic Bcl-2 family
member, Bid, and the truncated Bid (tBid) induces mitochondrial
cytochrome c release (10). Cross talk between the two pathways is
mediated by the tBid (11). In addition, a third pathway has also
been identified in which Bid is cleaved downstream of the point
of Bcl-2 action, catalyzed by caspase-3, upstream of caspase-8
activation, and acts as a potential feedback loop for amplification
of apoptosis-associated release of cytochrome c from the
mitochondria (12).
Sanguinarine (13-methylbenzodi-oxolo[5,6-]-1,3-dioxolo[4,5-I]
phenanthridinium) is a benzophenanthridin alkaloid that has
significant structural homology to chelethrine, derived from the
root of Sanguinaria canadendid and other poppy fumaria species
(13, 14). Sanguinarine has been shown to possess antimicrobial,
antioxidant, and antiproliferative properties (13, 15, 16). Recently,
one study suggested that sanguinarine suppresses the growth and
survival of human epidermoid carcinoma cells. In addition, this
agent has been shown to inhibit the activation of nuclear factor nB
(NF-nB; ref. 13), a transcription factor of critical importance in the
regulation of cell growth and survival. It should also be pointed out
that recent studies have implicated sanguinarine in the induction

of apoptosis of prostate cancer cells via formation of nitric oxide
and generation of superoxide radicals (17). Interestingly, sanguinarine does not exert an apoptotic affect on normal cells and
therefore can be developed as an anticancer drug (15).
In the present study, we investigated the antitumor activity of
sanguinarine against human PEL cell lines. Our data provide the
first evidence that sanguinarine induces apoptosis of PEL cells via
a mechanism involving up-regulation of death receptor 5 (DR5)
expression and generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Our
findings establish that up-regulation of DR5 results in activation of
caspase-8 and truncation of Bid (tBid), which in turn translocates
to the mitochondria and causes conformational changes as well
as oligomerization of the Bax protein, leading to loss of mitochondrial membrane potential and subsequent release of cytochrome c. Altogether, these studies establish that sanguinarine is a
potent inducer of apoptosis in PEL cells and identify the
mechanisms by which such apoptosis is induced.

Materials and Methods
Cell Culture and Treatment
The human PEL cell lines BC1, BC3, BCBL1, and HBL6 were obtained
from American Type Culture Collection (Rockville, MD) and cultured in
RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (FBS), 100
units/mL penicillin, 100 units/mL streptomycin at 37jC in an humidified
atmosphere containing 5% CO2. BC1 and HBL6 cell lines are co-infected
with EBV and HHV-8 whereas BC3 and BCBL1 cell lines are HHV-8 positive
only. The cells were treated with sanguinarine dissolved in DMSO at
concentrations of 0.25, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, and 4.0 Amol/L for different time periods
in RPMI culture media supplemented with 5% (v/v) FBS. The control cells
were incubated with maximum used amount of DMSO only.

with paraformaldehyde, and permeabilized in 70% ethanol. The cells were
subsequently stained with FITC-dUTP and stained cells were analyzed using
FACScan flow cytometry equipped with a Cell Quest data analysis program
(Becton Dickinson, San Diego, CA) as described earlier (20).

Annexin V/Propidium Iodide Dual Staining
PEL cell lines were treated with the indicated concentrations of
sanguinarine. The cells were harvested and the percentage of cells
undergoing apoptosis was measured by flow cytometry after staining with
fluorescein-conjugated Annexin V and propidium iodide (Molecular Probes)
as previously described (21).
Measurement of ROS. ROS production was detected using 2¶,7¶dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (H2DCFDA), a cell-permeable fluorescent probe. Exponentially growing cells were loaded with 10 Amol/L
H2DCFDA for 45 min before treatment at 37jC and were washed with PBS.
The cells were allowed to recover for 15 min at 37jC in RPMI media and
then treated with 2 Amol/L sanguinarine alone or in the presence of
10 mmol/L NAC for the indicated time periods. Following treatment, the
cells were washed in PBS and the green fluorescence intensity in the cells
was examined by FACS analysis. Propidium iodide was added 1 min before
flow cytometry to differentiate apoptosis from necrosis.
Reverse transcription-PCR assays. Total RNA was extracted following
treatment with 2 Amol/L sanguinarine for the indicated time periods using
Trizol (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and reverse transcribed with random
hexamers. Reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) amplifications were done
using the following primers: DR5 forward, GGAAGCCGCTCATGAGGAAGTTGG; DR5 reverse, GGCAAGTCTCTCTCCCAGCGTCTC for 35 cycles
(60jC annealing temperature) to yield an 181-bp product. Amplification
of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) was used as an
internal control to test the integrity of all cDNA and to provide a measure of
relative expression. All PCR products were analyzed by 4% agarose gel
electrophoresis and visualized with ethidium bromide under UV light using
an Alpha Imager (Alpha Innotech, San Leandro, CA).

3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-Diphenyltetrazolium
Bromide Assays
Cells (104) were incubated in triplicate in a 96-well plate in the presence
or absence of indicated test doses of sanguinarine in a final volume of 0.20
mL for 24 h. The ability of sanguinarine to suppress cell growth was
determined by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide
(MTT) cell proliferation assays as previously described (18).
Cell cycle analysis. Cell lines were either treated with and without
1 and 2 Amol/L sanguinarine for 24 h and the cells were washed once
with PBS, resuspended in 500 AL of hypotonic staining buffer (250 mg
sodium citrate, 0.75 mL Triton X-100, 25 Ag propidium iodide, 5 Ag RNase
A, and 250 mL water), and analyzed by flow cytometry as previously
described (19).

TUNEL Assay
PEL cells were treated with various concentrations of sanguinarine for
24 h, washed twice with PBS containing 0.2% bovine serum albumin, fixed

www.aacrjournals.org

All reactions were done in glass capillaries (Roche) with a final reaction
volume of 10 AL of 1 LightCycler FastStart DNA Master SYBR Green I
reaction mixture (Roche, Mannheim, Germany) containing FastStart Taq,
reaction buffer, and deoxynucleotide triphosphate, 1 mmol/L MgCl2, and
final concentrations of 0.5 Amol/L for each primer. Thermocycling and
detection were done on the LightCycler (Roche). Real-time PCR efficiencies
were calculated from the given slopes in LightCycler software using the
following equation:
E ¼ 10

½1=slope

Pfaffl et al.’s (22) method for relative quantification was used to calculate
fold changes for DR5 gene after sanguinarine treatment. The relative
expression ratio of a target gene is calculated based on efficiency (E) and
crossing point (CP) deviation of unknown samples (treated samples) versus
control (nontreated samples) and expressed in comparison with a reference
gene (GAPDH): Ratio = (E target)targetCP (control-sample) / (E Ref )refCP (control-sample).

Cell Lysis and Immunoblotting
Cells were treated with sanguinarine as described in the legends and
lysed as previously described (23). Proteins (15–20 Ag) were separated by
SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membrane
(Immobilon, Millipore, Billerica, MA). Immunoblotting was done with
different antibodies and visualized by the enhanced chemiluminescence
(Amersham, Piscataway, NJ) method.

Detection of Bax Conformational Changes
This assay was done as previously described (24). Briefly, following
treatment with indicated reagents for indicated time points, cells were
harvested and washed with PBS, after which they were lysed with Chaps
lysis buffer [10 mmol/L HEPES (pH 7.4), 150 mmol/L NaCl, 1% Chaps]
containing protease inhibitors as described. Protein concentrations were

assessed by Bradford assay and 500 Ag of total protein were incubated with
2 Ag of anti–Bax 6A7 monoclonal antibody for 2 h at 4jC. Following
incubation, 25 AL of protein G-beads were added into the reaction and
incubated at 4jC overnight on a shaker with gentle agitation. Following
washes in lysis buffer, samples were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred,
and immunoblotted with N20 Bax polyclonal antibody.

Cross-Linking of Bax Protein
Following treatment with 2 Amol/L sanguinarine for indicated time
periods, cells were washed twice with PBS and once with conjugating buffer
containing 150 mmol/L NaCl, 20 mmol/L HEPES (pH 7.2), 1.5 mmol/L
MgCl2, and 10 mmol/L glucose. Disuccinimidyl suberate in DMSO was
added at a final concentration of 2 mmol/L and incubated at room
temperature for 30 min. After incubation, the cross-linker was quenched by
the addition of 1 mol/L Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) to a final concentration of
20 mmol/L for 15 min at room temperature. Samples were then solubilized
in 0.5% NP40 lysis buffer and centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 10 min. Bax was
immunoprecipitated from the supernatant with Bax monoclonal antibody
and then immunoblotted with Bax polyclonal antibody. Samples incubated
with DMSO without disuccinimidyl suberate were used as negative controls.

Assays for Cytochrome c Release
The release of cytochrome c from mitochondria was assayed as
described earlier (25). Briefly, cells were treated with and without
sanguinarine as described in figure legends, harvested, and resuspended
in hypotonic buffer. Cells were homogenized and cytosolic as well as
mitochondrial fractions were isolated by differential centrifugation as

described before (25). Proteins (20–25 Ag) from cytosolic and mitochondrial
fractions of each sample were analyzed by immunoblotting with anti–
cytochrome c antibody.
Measurement of mitochondrial membrane potential. Cells were
treated with and without sanguinarine for 24 h, washed twice, and
resuspended in mitochondrial incubation buffer. JC1 was added to a final
concentration of 10 Amol/L and cells were incubated at 37jC in dark for
15 min. Cells were washed and resuspended in mitochondrial incubation
buffer and mitochondrial membrane potential (percent of green and red
aggregates) was determined by flow cytometry as previously described (26).
Statistical analysis. Comparisons between groups were made using
paired Student’s t test. P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.

Results
Sanguinarine causes a dose-dependent inhibition of proliferation and apoptosis of PEL cells. We initially sought to
determine whether sanguinarine treatment leads to the inhibition
of PEL cell proliferation. BC1, BC3, BCBL, and HBL6 cells were
cultured in the presence of 0.25, 1.0, 2.0, and 4 Amol/L sanguinarine
for 24 h and proliferation was analyzed by MTT assays. Figure 1A
shows that as the dose of sanguinarine increased from 0.25 to
4.0 Amol/L, cell growth inhibition increased in a dose-dependent
fashion in all the PEL cell lines. The growth inhibition induced
by sanguinarine treatment was found to be statistically significant

and stained with propidium iodide and then analyzed for DNA content by flow cytometry as described in Materials and Methods. C, sanguinarine-induced

subsequently stained with fluorescein-conjugated Annexin V and propidium iodide (PI ) and analyzed by flow cytometry. D, BC1 cells were treated with various doses of
sanguinarine as indicated for 24 h and DNA was extracted and separated by electrophoresis on 1.5% agarose gel.

Figure 2. Sanguinarine increases ROS generation and up-regulation of DR5 in PEL cells. A, sanguinarine increases ROS generation in PEL cells. BC1 and BC3 cells
were loaded with 10 Amol/L H2DCFDA for 45 min and then were incubated in the absence or presence of 2.0 Amol/L sanguinarine for indicated time periods, or
pretreated with 10 mmol/L NAC for 1 h followed by treatment with 2.0 Amol/L sanguinarine for indicated time periods (B). After washing with PBS, cells were
resuspended in PBS and immediately analyzed using flow cytometry for intracellular accumulation of ROS. C, sanguinarine induces up-regulation of DR5 expression.
BC1 and BC3 cells were treated with 2.0 Amol/L sanguinarine for indicated time periods. After cell lysis, equal amounts of proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE,
transferred to Immobilon membrane, and immunoblotted with antibodies against DR4, DR5, and h-actin. For mRNA analysis, BC1 and BC3 cells were treated with
2.0 Amol/L sanguinarine for indicated time periods and total RNA was isolated, reverse transcribed, and RT-PCR analyses for DR5 and GAPDH were done. D, effect

transferred to Immobilon membrane, and immunoblotted with antibodies against DR5 and h-actin.

(P < 0.001, Student’s t test) at most of the doses tested in all cell
lines.
In subsequent experiments, we determined whether the observed
suppressive effects of sanguinarine in MTT assays are due to
induction of cell cycle arrest or apoptosis. Different PEL cell lines
were treated with 1 and 2 Amol/L sanguinarine for 24 h or vehicle
alone. The cells were stained and cell cycle fractions were
determined by flow cytometry. As shown in Fig. 1B, the sub-G1
population of cells increased from 1.82% in control to 13.22% and
71.71% with 1.0 and 2.0 Amol/L sanguinarine, respectively, in BC1
cells. Similar results were obtained in BC3, 1.43% to 10.16% and
30.72%; in BCBL1, 3.35% to 20.50% and 43.39%; and in HBL6, 0.73%
to 11.79% and 25%. This increase in sub-G1 population was
accompanied by loss in G0-G1, S, and G2-M phase in sanguinarinetreated PEL cells. It has been reported that cells with these features
are those dying of apoptosis (27). We also used Annexin V/
propidium iodide dual staining, TUNEL assay, and DNA laddering
detection methods for further confirmation of sanguinarineinduced apoptosis in PEL cells. BC1 cells were treated with different
doses of sanguinarine for 24 h and apoptosis was measured by

www.aacrjournals.org

Annexin V/propidium iodide dual staining. As shown in Fig. 1C,
sanguinarine induced apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner. As
shown in Supplementary Fig. S1B, 2 Amol/L sanguinarine treatment
for 24 h causes significant apoptosis in all the cell lines tested (P <
0.001). TUNEL assay was done on cells treated with 2.0 Amol/L
sanguinarine for 24 h. As shown in Supplementary Fig. S1, sanguinarine treatment resulted in apoptosis in all the cell lines studied.
Finally, we analyzed DNA fragmentation, which is another hallmark
of apoptosis. BC1 cells were treated with DMSO and 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, and
4.0 Amol/L sanguinarine for 24 h; DNA was isolated using apoptotic
DNA laddering kit from Roche. As shown in Fig. 1D, sanguinarine
caused a dose-dependent fragmentation formation of DNA, a
characteristic of apoptotic cell death. These results suggest that
suppression of growth by sanguinarine treatment in PEL cells is via
induction of apoptosis.
Sanguinarine-induced ROS generation regulates up-regulation
of DR5. A number of compounds used in chemotherapy induce
cell death through the generation of ROS (28). We examined
whether ROS were also generated in PEL cells treated with
2 Amol/L sanguinarine for various time periods, and if so,

whether this is a mechanism for the induction of sanguinarineinduced apoptosis. H2DCFDA-based FACS detection revealed that
intracellular ROS levels increased in a time-dependent manner,
starting as early as 1 h after treatment, peaking at 4 h, and
diminishing after 8 h of treatment with sanguinarine (Fig. 2A).
NAC is a widely used thiol-containing antioxidant that scavenges
ROS in cells by interacting with OH and H2O2, thus affecting
ROS-mediated signaling pathways. The sanguinarine-induced
increases in ROS levels were blocked by pretreatment with
10 mmol/L NAC (Fig. 2B).
Recent studies have shown that ROS generated by sulforaphane
and hydrogen peroxide up-regulate the expression of DR5, whereas
pretreatment with NAC causes a significant inhibition of ROSinduced up-regulation of DR5 gene and protein expression in
hepatoma cells (29). In view of these findings, we sought to
determine whether sanguinarine-generated free radicals modulate
the expression of DR4 and DR5. First, we carried out Western
blotting to investigate the induction DR4 and DR5 proteins by
sanguinarine. BC1 and BC3 cells were treated with 2.0 Amol/L
sanguinarine for various time periods and cell lysates were
separated on SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with antibodies
against DR4 and DR5. As shown in Fig. 2C, sanguinarine treatment

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (8). April 15, 2007

of PEL cells selectively up-regulated DR5 but not DR4 protein in a
time-dependent manner. We then examined whether sanguinarine
treatment of PEL cells regulated DR5 expression at the transcription level. RT-PCR analysis showed that sanguinarine enhanced
DR5 up-regulation at the mRNA level in a time-dependent manner
(Fig. 2C). We further quantified the level of DR5 expression after
sanguinarine treatment by quantitative real-time PCR. As shown in
Supplementary Fig. S2, there was a 2-fold increase in the expression
level of DR5 in BC1 cells after 2 h of sanguinarine treatment, which
further increased to >14-fold after 16 h. A similar pattern of DR5
expression in response to sanguinarine was also seen in the BC3
cell line, as measured by Pfaffl et al.’s (22) method. Altogether, these
results indicate that sanguinarine-induced apoptosis involves upregulation of DR5 expression at the mRNA and protein levels in
PEL cells.
To investigate whether ROS generation is directly associated
with sanguinarine-induced DR5 up-regulation, we assessed DR5
expression in PEL cells pretreated with NAC for 1 h followed by
treatment with 2.0 Amol/L sanguinarine. As shown in Fig. 2D,
treatment with sanguinarine significantly increased DR5 protein
levels, whereas pretreatment with 10 mmol/L NAC markedly
inhibited the sanguinarine-induced DR5 up-regulation. In addition,

pretreatment with 80 Amol/L of pan-caspase inhibitor z-VAD-fmk
followed by sanguinarine treatment did not alter the expression
level of DR5, suggesting no active role for caspases in the regulation
of DR5 expression. Taken together, these data clearly indicate that
ROS generation is critical for sanguinarine-induced DR5 upregulation.
Sanguinarine-induced activation of caspase-8 and Bid
cleavage in PEL cells. The apoptotic signaling cascade starts
with activation of caspase-8 and truncation of Bid that translocates
to the mitochondrial membrane, allowing activation of proapoptotic proteins and release of cytochrome c. Therefore, we sought
to determine whether sanguinarine-induced apoptosis involves
the mitochondria. PEL cells were treated with various doses of
sanguinarine for 24 h and cell lysates were separated on SDS-PAGE
and immunoblotted with an antibody against caspase-8. Figure 3A
shows that sanguinarine treatment resulted in a reduction in the
intensity of the full-length band of procaspase-8, indicating
activation of caspase-8. When the blot was exposed for a longer
time period, cleaved product of caspase-8 was detected, suggesting
that sanguinarine causes apoptosis via activation of the extrinsic
mechanism through the cleavage of caspase-8. Bid is a BH3
proapoptotic protein that can be cleaved directly by caspase8 during apoptosis (30–32). The cleaved Bid or tBid plays a role in
the induction of Bax conformational change and subsequent
translocation to mitochondria (31–35). Therefore, we examined the
role of Bid cleavage after sanguinarine treatment of PEL cells. As
shown in Fig. 3A, treatment with 1 and 2.0 Amol/L sanguinarine
resulted in a decreased level of full-length of Bid and the
appearance of a tBid band. These results suggest that sanguinar-

ine-induced apoptosis in PEL cells may occur via activation of
caspase-8 and Bid.
Sanguinarine induces Bax conformational changes and
oligomerization. As it is known that tBid plays a role in the
activation of Bax and apoptosis, we examined the activation of
Bax in response to sanguinarine treatment. BC3 cells were treated
with 2.0 Amol/L sanguinarine for 4 and 8 h and lysed with 1.0%
Chaps lysis buffer; lysates were immunoprecipitated with Bax 6A7
antibody that recognizes only the conformationally changed Bax
protein. The detergent Chaps has been shown to retain the Bax
protein in its native conformation. As shown in Supplementary
Fig. S3A, conformationally changed Bax was detected 4 and 8 h
after treatment with 2.0 Amol/L sanguinarine. To confirm these
results, we also incubated BC3 cells following sanguinarine
treatment with anti–immunoglobulin G and could not detect the
conformationally changed Bax. The oligomerization of Bax has
previously been shown to occur only in apoptotic cells, possibly
playing a role in mediating cytochrome c release (36). To test this
possibility, we sought to determine whether sanguinarine treatment of PEL cells could trigger Bax oligomerization. BC3 cells were
treated with sanguinarine for different time periods and, after
harvesting, cells were subsequently exposed to the membranepermeable cross-linking agent disuccinimidyl suberate. The crosslinked proteins were separated on SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted
for the analysis of Bax oligomerization. As shown in Fig. 3B, an
immunoreactive band of 42 to 46 kDa, previously reported as a Bax
homodimer (37), could be detected from the sanguinarine-treated
BC3 cell lysate. In addition, 88- to 90-kDa bands, which could be
Bax tetramer or oligomer, were also detectable. These bands were

not detected in DMSO-only cross-linked samples, suggesting
specificity of the experiment. In addition, a nonspecific band
above 32 kDa was detected in all the samples. These results suggest
that sanguinarine treatment of PEL cells involves Bax dimerization/oligomerization, which plays an important role in sanguinarine-induced apoptosis.
Next, we attempted to investigate the mechanism of Bax
activation initiated by sanguinarine. BC1 and BC3 cells were
pretreated with either 10 mmol/L NAC or 80 Amol/L z-VAD-fmk for
1 h followed by treatment with and without 2 Amol/L sanguinarine
for 8 h, followed by lysis in 1% Chaps lysis buffer and immunoprecipitation with Bax 6A7 monoclonal antibody. As shown in
Fig. 3C, expression of conformationally changed Bax was only
detected in sanguinarine alone treated samples. Interestingly, NAC
and z-VAD-fmk pretreatment was completely able to block the
expression of Bax in the presence of sanguinarine. These data
strongly suggest that Bax translocation in sanguinarine-induced
apoptosis is downstream of caspase-8 activation. These data also
confirm that sanguinarine treatment of PEL cell lines activates the
extrinsic apoptotic pathway via release of ROS, leading to the
up-regulation of DR5 and the recruitment and cleavage of caspase8 and Bid.
Sanguinarine induces loss of mitochondrial membrane
potential and subsequently release of cytochrome c to cytosol.
We further tested the effect of sanguinarine on mitochondrial
membrane potential using JC1 dye. BC1 BC3, BCBL1, and HBL6
cells were treated with 2 Amol/L sanguinarine for 24 h. As shown
in Fig. 3D, sanguinarine treatment of these cells resulted in loss of
mitochondrial membrane potential as measured by JC1 staining,
with green fluorescence depicting apoptotic cells. Cytochrome c
release from mitochondria in BC1 and BC3 cells treated with
sanguinarine was examined by Western blot analysis. Cells were
treated in the presence and absence of 2.0 Amol/L sanguinarine
for 24 h. Cytosolic-specific, mitochondrion-free as well as mitochondrial lysates was prepared as described in Materials and
Methods. Cell fractionation results showed that cytochrome c
translocated from mitochondria to cytosol following sanguinarine
treatment. As shown in Supplementary Fig. S3B, the protein levels
of cytochrome c increased in the cytosolic fractions and, concomitantly, decreased in mitochondria-enriched heavy membrane
fractions of PEL cells after sanguinarine treatment. These results
suggest that sanguinarine treatment of PEL cells causes apoptosis
via the release of cytochrome c from the mitochondria. These
results further support our notion that sanguinarine-induced
apoptosis in PEL cells involves signaling at the mitochondrial
level.
Sanguinarine-induced signaling results in caspase-9 and
caspase-3 activation and PARP cleavage in PEL cells. Because
caspases are important mediators of apoptosis in response to
various apoptotic stimuli (33), we investigated whether sanguinarine treatment also caused their activation. BC1, BC3, BCBL1, and
HBL6 cells were treated with 1.0 and 2 Amol/L sanguinarine for
24 h and immunoblotted with anti–caspase-3, anti–cleaved
caspase-3, and anti-PARP antibodies. As shown in Fig. 4A,
sanguinarine treatment of PEL cells induced activation of
caspase-9 and caspase-3 cleavage in all cell lines. PARP, a
downstream target of caspase-3, was also cleaved in all the cell
lines, a hallmark of cells undergoing apoptosis. Furthermore,
pretreatment of PEL cells with 80 Amol/L z-VAD-fmk (Fig. 4B), a
universal inhibitor of caspases, or 10 mmol/L NAC (Fig. 4C)
abrogated caspase-3 and PARP activation and prevented cell death

induced by sanguinarine, clearly indicating that release of ROS as
well as caspases play a critical role in sanguinarine-induced
apoptosis in PEL cells.
Modulation of inhibitor of apoptosis protein family in
sanguinarine-induced apoptosis in PEL cells. We also examined
whether sanguinarine induces cell death by modulating the
expression of inhibitor of apoptosis protein (IAP) family members,
which ultimately determine the cell response to apoptotic stimuli.
BC1, BC3, and BCBL1 cells were treated with 2.0 Amol/L
sanguinarine for 24 h and expression of cIAP1, cIAP2, and XIAP
was determined by Western blotting. As shown in Fig. 5A,
sanguinarine treatment caused down-regulation of cIAP1 and
cIAP2 as well as XIAP protein, whereas pretreatment with 10
mmol/L NAC restored the expression of the IAPs. These results
indicate that IAP proteins may also be involved in sanguinarineinduced apoptosis.
Based on our findings in this article, as well as the studies of
other investigators, we propose a model (Fig. 6) in which we
show the relationship between the release of ROS and upregulation of DR5, activation of the caspase cascade, and
involvement of the mitochondrion, ultimately leading to DNA
fragmentation and apoptosis following sanguinarine treatment in
PEL cell lines.

Sanguinarine-Mediated Signaling in Lymphoma Cells

Discussion
In the present study, we investigated the direct effects of
sanguinarine on PEL cells in vitro. Our results show that
sanguinarine exhibits potent, dose-dependent proapoptotic effects
on PEL cells and provide evidence that such apoptosis occurs via
generation of ROS, leading to up-regulation of DR5. We found that
exposure of PEL cells to sanguinarine induces rapid and transient
ROS generation that was evident as early as 1 h after treatment and
diminished within 8 h (Fig. 2A). The release of ROS by sanguinarine
was blocked by pretreatment of PEL cells with NAC, suggesting
a role of superoxide radical in the process. The demonstration of
up-regulation of DR5 by sanguinarine is of high interest because
DR5 plays a critical role in the recruitment of caspase-8 and the
activation of the extrinsic apoptotic pathway (38). This is the first
study showing that sanguinarine treatment causes up-regulation
of DR5 protein expression by a positive regulatory effect at the
transcriptional level, providing evidence for the generation of the
proapoptotic effects of this agent in PEL cells. Interestingly, a
recent study by Singh et al. (39) showed that sulforaphane-induced
apoptosis is also mediated by ROS via up-regulation of DR5 (29),
whereas pretreatment with NAC inhibits such sulforaphaneinduced apoptosis. Thus, both sulforaphane and sanguinarine
seem to use a common effector mechanism for the induction of
apoptosis in malignant cells involving ROS-mediated up-regulation
of DR5.
It is well documented that the death receptor–mediated
apoptotic signaling pathway requires recruitment of Fas-associated
death domain and caspase-8, which results in caspase-8 activation
and subsequent activation of its downstream caspase cascades and
apoptosis (40, 41). In addition, for efficient apoptosis, the activation
of intrinsic apoptosis pathway is critical. Our results show that

sanguinarine induces activation and cleavage of caspase-8,
resulting in the truncation of Bid, a BH3-only proapoptotic protein
(31, 32). The resulting tBid plays a role in the generation of Bax
conformational changes and subsequent translocation to mitochondria (33), leading to the formation of mitochondrial pores.
Based on our experimental results, Bax conformational changes
and its translocation to the mitochondria are dependent on the
activation of the extrinsic apoptotic pathway and truncation of
Bid. We also clearly establish that pretreatment of PEL cells
with universal caspase inhibitor z-VAD-fmk completely blocks
the sanguinarine-dependent conformational changes of the Bax
protein in PEL cell lines. If the intrinsic apoptotic pathway alone
was being activated, z-VAD-fmk treatment would not have been
able to block Bax conformational change, suggesting caspase
dependency. Pretreatment of NAC also blocked Bax conformational changes following sanguinarine treatment in both cell lines.
These results clearly indicate that sanguinarine-induced apoptosis
requires not only release of ROS but also up-regulation of DR5 and
activation of caspase-8 to function efficiently. It should also be
pointed out that previous studies have shown that sanguinarine is
a potent inhibitor of NF-nB activation and blocks the phosphorylation and degradation of InBa (13). It is therefore possible that
such effects of sanguinarine on NF-nB activation also participate in
the generation of proapoptotic signals and/or cooperate with ROSmediated up-regulation of DR5 to induce cell death, but this
remains to be directly examined in future studies.
There are reports indicating that overexpression of Bax enhances
cytochrome c release from mitochondria to the cytosol (42),
whereas direct addition of recombinant Bax protein to isolated
mitochondria has been previously shown to induce cytochrome c
release (43). Our results establish that sanguinarine induces the

loss of mitochondrial potential in most of the PEL cells. Loss of
mitochondrial membrane potential is the root mechanism
responsible for cytochrome c release in response to different
cytotoxic stimuli. More recently, ample evidence suggests (44–46)
that some apoptogenic agents induce Bax translocation to the
mitochondrial membrane, followed by cytochrome c release. In
mammalian cells, the release of cytochrome c from the mitochondria has been proposed as a critical event for cells to initiate the
apoptotic cascade. In cytosol, cytochrome c plays a key role in the
formation of apoptosome complex by activating the binding of
procaspase-9 and Apaf-1 in the presence of ATP (47). The
formation of the apoptosome then causes cleavage of caspase-9,
which propagates the death signal by activating caspase-3 and
causing cleavage of PARP. Activation and cleavage of PARP is the
hallmark of apoptosis that in turn causes DNA fragmentation and
cell death.
Expression of IAPs correlates with apoptosis resistance in
transformed cell types and in a variety of human tumors including
lymphoid malignant cells (48, 49). IAPs have been shown to
suppress caspase activity and protect cells from apoptosis induced
by a variety of agents. Our results show that all the PEL cell lines
express IAPs, including cIAP1, cIAP2, and XIAP, and that
sanguinarine treatment decreases the expression level of these
molecules, indicating that down-regulation of IAPs may be involved

PEL is an incurable, aggressive B-cell malignancy, and most of
the patients respond poorly to traditional chemotherapy and
develop chemoresistance. Several agents have been tested in the
search for a more effective treatment of PEL. Our study provides
the first evidence that sanguinarine is capable of inducing
apoptosis of PEL and raises the possibility that this novel agent
may prove to be of future value in the treatment of PEL. These data
also raise the possibility that sanguinarine may also have activity
against other malignant phenotypes via its ability to activate the
extrinsic apoptotic pathway. These findings have important
clinical-translational implications because they raise the possibility
that sanguinarine may be useful against PEL in vivo. Future
investigations aimed at determining the efficacy of sanguinarine
and possibly other inhibitors of the mitochondrial-induced
pathway in PEL are warranted and may lead to the future
development of new effective therapies for the treatment of these
uniformly fatal lymphomas.
