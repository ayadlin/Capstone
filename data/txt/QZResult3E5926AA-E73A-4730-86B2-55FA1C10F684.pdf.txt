ABSTRACT
Sesquiterpene lactones (SLs) are the active constituents of a variety of medicinal
plants and found to have potential anticancer activities. However, the intracellular
molecular targets of SLs and the underlying molecular mechanisms have not been well
elucidated. In this study, we observed that EM23, a natural SL, exhibited anti-cancer
activity in human cervical cancer cell lines by inducing apoptosis as indicated by
caspase 3 activation, XIAP downregulation and mitochondrial dysfunction. Mechanistic
studies indicated that EM23-induced apoptosis was mediated by reactive oxygen
species (ROS) and the knockdown of thioredoxin (Trx) or thioredoxin reductase (TrxR)
resulted in a reduction in apoptosis. EM23 attenuated TrxR activity by alkylation of
C-terminal redox-active site Sec498 of TrxR and inhibited the expression levels of
Trx/TrxR to facilitate ROS accumulation. Furthermore, inhibition of Trx/TrxR system
resulted in the dissociation of ASK1 from Trx and the downstream activation of JNK.
Pretreatment with ASK1/JNK inhibitors partially rescued cells from EM23-induced
apoptosis. Additionally, EM23 inhibited Akt/mTOR pathway and induced autophagy,
which was observed to be proapoptotic and mediated by ROS. Together, these results
reveal a potential molecular mechanism for the apoptotic induction observed with SL
compound EM23, and emphasize its putative role as a therapeutic agent for human
cervical cancer.

INTRODUCTION

which participates in wide variety of cellular processes
including the oxidative stress response, gene regulation
via the NF-κB, p53, and Ref-1 transcription factors, and
the competitive inhibition of apoptosis-regulating signal
kinase 1 (ASK1)-induced apoptosis [2].
Elevated Trx/TrxR activity was found to be involved
in the development and progression of cancer [3, 4].
Notably, over expression of Trx/TrxR can promote cancer

Thioredoxin reductase (TrxR) is a ubiquitously
expressed oxidoreductase crucial for maintaining
cellular redox homeostasis by counteracting the effects
of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and regulating redoxrelated signaling cascades [1]. TrxR is the only enzyme
known to catalyze the reduction of thioredoxin (Trx),

cell proliferation and has been associated with tumor
angiogenesis, invasion, and metastasis [5]. Furthermore,
the Trx/TrxR system contributes to tumor cell resistance
to oxidative stress-induced apoptosis [6], which is an
important mechanism of various anticancer agents.
In addition, knock down of TrxR expression nearly
abolished the capacity of lung cancer cells to form tumors
in a xenograft model system [7]; over expression of the
alternative splicing variant of TrxR induced apoptosis
in HeLa cells [8]. Overall, these studies substantiate the
notion that mammalian TrxR may be a promising drug
target for cancer therapy.
The C-terminal active site of mammalian TrxR
has a conserved sequence, -Gly-Cys-Sec-Gly-COOH,
which contains an active selenocysteine. During
catalysis, electrons are transferred from NADPH to the
N-terminal active site of TrxR, where they are delivered
to the C-terminal redox-active sites (Cys497 and Sec498) [9].
Then, TrxR can subsequently reduce various substrates,
including the disulfide active site of Trx. The inhibitory
effects of many active compounds and drugs targeting
mammalian TrxR are mainly based on their interactions
with the Sec498 residue. Prominent examples include goldand platinum-based compounds [10], arsenic trioxide [11],
curcumin [12], and natural flavonoids [13].
Sesquiterpene lactones (SLs) are the active
constituents of a variety of medicinal plants. In recent
years, the anticancer activity of SLs has attracted a great
deal of interest and extensive research has been carried
out to illuminate their anticancer properties [14]. SLs have
been reported to inhibit proliferation, migration, invasion
and induce apoptosis in various tumor cells, such as lung
cancer [15], breast cancer [16], melanoma [17], leukaemia
[18], and colorectal cancer [19]. Main molecular events
involved in these SLs-specific activities were investigated
to be inhibition of NF-κB activation, suppression of antiapoptotic proteins, and blockage of PI3K/Akt and JAK2/
STAT3 signaling [19–22]. However, the intracellular
molecular targets of SLs have not been well elucidated
and continued work is needed to identify the mechanisms
underlying the potential function of SLs in cancer therapy.
In this study, we demonstrate the anticancer
activity of EM23, a natural SL family member isolated
from Elephantopus mollis, in the CaSki and SiHa human
cervical cancer cell lines. Mechanistically, we demonstrate
that EM23 specifically targets the mammalian TrxR by
alkylating the C-terminal redox-active site Sec498 of this
enzyme. EM23-induced ROS accumulation and ASK1/
JNK signal activation are critical for the induction of
apoptosis. Furthermore, EM23 treatment also facilitates
autophagy, which contributes to the post-treatment
apoptosis observed in CaSki and SiHa cells.

Growth inhibitory effect of EM23 on human
cancer cell lines
The chemical structure of EM23 is shown in
Figure 1A. To determine the effect of EM23 on the cellular
growth inhibition, several human cancer cell lines were
treated with varying concentrations of EM23 for 24 h,
including lung cancer cell line A549; human breast cancer
cell line MCF-7; human esophageal cancer cell lines TE-1,
EC109, and EC9706; human cervical cancer cell lines
CaSki and SiHa; and human leukemia cell lines HL-60
and K562. Cell viability was assessed by MTT assay. As
shown in Figure 1B, EM23 exhibited the most significant
growth inhibitory activities on cervical CaSki and SiHa
cell lines. The IC50 values of EM23 for CaSki and SiHa
cells were 5.8 and 6.6 μM, respectively. In contrast,
significantly lesser loss of cell viability due to treatment
with EM23 was observed on human cervical epithelial
Ect1/E6E7 cell line (Supplementary Figure S1). The IC50
value of EM23 for Ect1/E6E7 cells was 85.5 μM, which
was approximately 15-fold and 13-fold higher than that
of for CaSki and SiHa cells, respectively. The molecular
mechanism(s) underlying the effects of EM23 on the
human cervical cancer cell lines was next investigated.

EM23 induces cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in
CaSki and SiHa cells
To examine the mechanism underlying the
inhibitory effects of EM23 on cell growth, the cell cycle
phase distributions of EM23-treated CaSki and SiHa cells
were analyzed by flow cytometry. Notably, an increase
in the G2/M population was observed in cells following
treatment with EM23, as treatment with 20 μM EM23
increased the G2/M population of CaSki and SiHa cells by
29% and 13%, respectively, as compared to control groups
(Figure 1C).
To investigate EM23-induced apoptotic cell death,
both cell lines were treated with increasing concentrations
of EM23 for 24 h and stained with Annexin-V-FITC/
PI. The resulting apoptotic ratios were analyzed by
flow cytometry. As shown in Figure 1D, EM23 elicited
apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner in both cell lines,
as treatment with 20 μM EM23 resulted in 60% and 87%
cell death in CaSki and SiHa cells, respectively. The
TUNEL assay for observation of apoptotic DNA cleavage
also confirmed EM23-induced apoptosis (Supplementary
Figure S2).

EM23 induces caspase 3 activation and
mitochondrial dysfunction
We next analyzed the effect of EM23 on
caspase 3 activation, PARP cleavage, and XIAP

protein expression. Significantly, western bloting
analysis revealed that EM23 induced caspase 3
cleavage, and downregulated the expression level
of pro-caspase 3 (Figure 2A). PARP, a DNA-repair
enzyme, is a known substrate of caspase 3 [23];
therefore, we examined PARP degradation following
EM23 treatment. As shown in Figure 2A, PARP
underwent specific proteolytic cleavage as suggested by
the generation of the 89 kDa PARP fragment in CaSki
cells treated with EM23 at 5, 15 and 20 μM and in SiHa
cells treated with EM23 at 15 and 20 μM, respectively.
In addition, the expression level of XIAP, the most

potent human IAP protein that can inhibit the activity of
caspase 3 was observed to decrease with EM23 treatment
in a dose-dependent manner.
Mitochondria play a central role in the intrinsic
apoptosis pathway. The loss of mitochondrial membrane
potential (MMP; Δψm) is regarded as a hallmark of cell
apoptosis that occurs prior to caspase activation [24]. As
shown in Figure 2B, EM23 treatment significantly disrupted
the Δψm in both cell lines, as demonstrated in a shift from
red to green. Notably, the relative percentage of fluorescence
green cells increased by 54% and 35% in CaSki and SiHa
cells, respectively, following treatment with 20 μM EM23.

EM23 induced-ROS generation is involved in its
anticancer activity

inhibited by EM23 in a dose-dependent manner with
an IC50 value of 7.8 μM as determined by DTNB assay.
In addition, EM23-induced TrxR inactivation was also
positively correlated with incubation time (Figure 4B).
TrxR activity was almost completely inhibited by EM23
after 90 min of incubation. These results identify EM23 as
an effective TrxR inhibitor.

Mitochondria are the main source of ROS, and excess
ROS accumulation elicits oxidative stress that can cause
prominent damage to DNA, lipids, and proteins within the
cell to subsequently induce apoptosis [25]. To investigate the
role of ROS generation on the anticancer activity of EM23,
we first examined intracellular ROS production in EM23treated CaSki and SiHa cells using DCFH-DA. As shown
in Figure 3A, EM23 caused a remarkable accumulation of
ROS in CaSki and SiHa cells, particularly following the
4 and 2 h treatments, respectively. Notably, pretreatment
with NAC, a ROS scavenger, almost completely rescued
EM23-induced apoptosis in both cell lines, indicating that
ROS accumulation is involved in EM23-induced apoptosis
(Figure 3B and 3C). Furthermore, EM23 induced Δψm
disruption was also completely rescued by NAC pretreatment (Figure 3D).

EM23 attenuates TrxR activity by binding the
selenocysteine site
The three-dimensional crystal structure of
mammalian TrxR revealed two redox-active sites (Cys497
and Sec498) located on the flexible C-terminal arm of the
enzyme [9]. In its reduced form, TrxR-Cys497 and -Sec498
were present as –SH and –SeH groups, respectively. It
has been reported that both –SH and –SeH groups can be
alkylated at high pH (pH 8.5), while only the –SeH group
is alkylated at low pH (pH 6.5) [26]. As such, we applied
this finding to identify whether EM23 targeted these active
sites by performing BIAM alkylating reactions in buffers
with different pH values.
As shown in Figure 4C, a weaker band intensity
was observed when the reduced form of TrxR was
incubated with EM23 prior to BIAM labeling, indicating
that TrxR was first alkylated by EM23. Notably, at low pH

EM23 inhibits the activity of TrxR in cell-free
systems
To investigate the effects of EM23 on TrxR activity,
NADPH-reduced TrxR was incubated with EM23 in cellfree system. As shown in Figure 4A, TrxR activity was

(pH 6.5), band intensity weakened dramatically with
high concentrations of EM23, indicating that C-terminal
redox-activesite Sec498 can be alkylated by EM23. At
a high pH (pH 8.5), the band intensity weakened at
the same extent observed in low pH (pH 6.5) buffer,
indicating that the TrxR-Sec498 redox-active site is the
only specific target for EM23 modification.
To further confirm this result, a short TrxR
C-terminal peptide Ac-Gly-[Cys-Sec]-Gly-NH2 was
synthesized and reacted with EM23 to determine whether
EM23 could specifically bind the selenol group of TrxR.
The representative TOF LC/MS spectrum of this reaction
products were shown in Figure 4D. The molecular mass
of the m/z 383.1 ([M+Na]+) and 448.0 ([M+Na]+) signal
peak exactly matches that of EM23 and the tetrapeptide,
respectively. The molecular mass signal identified at
m/z 810.2 ([M+Na]+) showed the distinctive isotopic
pattern characteristic of selenium (Figure 4D, up
right), indicating that an equivalent amount of EM23
covalently bound to the tetrapeptide. However, no signal
at m/z 1170.4 ([M+Na]+) was detected (data not shown),
suggesting that there existed no adduct of the tetrapeptide
bearing two EM23 groups in this reaction. This MS result
confirmed TrxR-Sec498 redox-active site as the specific
target for EM23.

was diminished in both cell lines, and was dose-dependent
in SiHa cells. Interestingly, TrxR expression slightly
increased with 5 μM EM23 treatment in the CaSki cell
line, but then decreased dose-dependently with the 15 and
20 μM treatments. Furthermore, the mRNA expression
levels of Trx and TrxR were assessed by RT-PCR assay.
As shown in Figure 6B, 5 μM EM23 treatment resulted in
an increase of Trx and TrxR mRNA transcription, whereas
15 and 20 μM downregulated their expression levels in
both cell lines.

Knock down of Trx or TrxR results in a
reduction of EM23-induced apoptosis
To directly assess the role of the Trx/TrxR system
in EM23-induce apoptosis, we utilized siRNAs that
specifically target either Trx or TrxR, in addition to a
control siRNA. As shown in Figure 7A, transfection of
Trx or TrxR siRNA effectively reduced the respective
protein levels in both cell lines. EM23-induced apoptosis
in siRNA transfected CaSki and SiHa cells was then
assessed by Annexin-V-FITC/PI staining and flow
cytometry analysis. Significantly, knock down of Trx or
TrxR attenuated EM23-induced apoptosis in both cell lines
(Figure 7B). These results suggest that targeting the Trx/
TrxR system is essential for EM23-induced apoptosis in
CaSki and SiHa cells.

Docking simulation between EM23 and the
active site of TrxR

EM23 induces activation of ASK1/JNK signaling

In order to further investigate the binding modes of
EM23 with TrxR, molecular docking studies were carried
out by Surflex-Dock suite implemented in SYBYL 8.0
software. The results showed that the most energetically
favorable binding mode of EM23 at the active site of
TrxR comed into a free binding energy of −5.08 kcal/mol.
The MOLCAD surface modeling displayed in Fast
Connolly pattern demonstrated that EM23 extended into
the pocket of active site of TrxR (Figure 5A). The lactonic
ring of EM23 was close to the C-terminal Cys497/Cys498
motif of TrxR (The Sec498 has been substituted by a Cys
residue in the crystal structure of TrxR [27]). The distances
of carbonyl motif at the lactonic ring of EM23 between
backbone NH of Cys497 and Cys498 were 2.01 and 1.95
Å, respectively, which may allow hydrogen bonding and
contribute to covalent interactions between EM23 and side
chain of Cys497 and/or Cys498. Additionally, the oxygen
atom at the lactonic ring of EM23 forms another hydrogen
bond with the backbone NH of Gly496.

The competitive inhibitory effect of reduced Trx
on ASK1 is one of the important mechanisms by which
Trx/TrxR system elicits apoptotic resistance in cancer
cells [28]. ROS-induced apoptosis can be induced by
the oxidization of Trx, and the subsequent release of
ASK1, which can then be activated to prompt apoptotic
signaling through the p38 and JNK pathway [29]. Here,
we investigated Trx-ASK1 complex formation after
treatment with 15 μM EM23 by co-immunoprecipitation
assay. As expected, we found that ASK1 dissociated
from Trx following EM23 treatment in both cell lines
(Figure 8A), and consequently gained kinase activity
sufficient to elicit downstream signal activation, as
demonstrated by the increase in phosphorylated ASK1 and
JNK, respectively (Figure 8B). Furthermore, an increase
in ASK1 protein expression was observed in both cell
lines after EM23 treatment (Figure 8B). Interestingly, we
found that extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase
1/2 (ERK1/2) signaling was also activated after EM23
treatment, but only in CaSki cells (Figure 8B).
To further investigate the role of these kinases
in EM23-induced apoptosis, Annexin-V-FITC/PI dual
staining flow cytometry analysis was used to analyze the
cellular apoptosis induced by the combination of EM23
and ASK1 or JNK inhibitor. As shown in Figure 9, the
ASK1 and JNK inhibitors attenuated EM23-induced
apoptosis in both cell lines. Notably, the apoptotic ratio

EM23 inhibits the expression levels of Trx/TrxR
in CaSki and SiHa cells
The Trx/TrxR system plays a crucial role in both
cellular redox homeostasis and cell death regulation, and
is often found over-expressed in cancer. We next examined
effects of EM23 on Trx and TrxR expression in CaSki and
SiHa cells. As shown in Figure 6A, Trx protein expression

declined to about 24% and 23%, respectively, in CaSki
cells, and about 20% and 23%, respectively, in SiHa cells,
as compared to EM23-only treatment group. These results
further support the important role for ASK1/JNK signaling
in EM23-induced apoptosis.
JNK signaling pathway is a crucial downstream
pathway triggered by the oxidative stress response [30]. As
such, we investigated the effect of the anti-oxidant, NAC,
on EM23-induced JNK signaling. As shown in Figure 8C,
NAC pretreatment blocked EM23-induced JNK activation

and PARP cleavage, emphasizing the essential role of ROS
in EM23-induced JNK pathway activation and subsequent
cell apoptosis.

EM23 induces autophagy and inhibits
Akt/mTOR signaling pathway
Autophagy-related programmed cell death has been
observed in the cellular response to several anticancer
reagents [31]. In our study, we found that treatment

with 15 μM EM23 for 24 h induced autophagy in both
CaSki and SiHa cells, as demonstrated by the autophagic
vacuoles observed with electron microscopy (Figure 10A).
Furthermore, we found that 15 μM EM23 also induced the

accumulation of LC3-II (Figure 10B), an autophagy-related,
ubiquitin-like modifier, regarded as an autophagosomal
marker in mammals cells [32]. These results suggest that
EM23 induced autophagy in CaSki and SiHa cells.

EM23-induced autophagy is mediated by ROS
and promotes apoptosis

The Akt/mTOR-mediated signaling cascade is a
key negative regulator of autophagy [33]. As shown in
Figure 10C, both Akt and mTOR phosphorylation
declined in response to EM23 treatment. The
phosphorylation status of 70S6K and 4E-BP1,
the substrates of mTOR was then examined [34].
It was observed that the phosphorylation level of
70S6K decreased in both cell lines upon treatment
with EM23; however, no significant change in
phosphaorylation was observed for that of 4E-BP1
(Figure 10C). It is interesting that EM23 only caused
a slight decrease in phosphorylation level of ribosomal
protein S6, the downstream target of 70S6K, and had
no effect on the expression level of S6 (Figure 10C).
Together, these results indicate the involvement of Akt/
mTOR signaling pathway in EM23-induced autophagy.

Autophagy frequently results from ROS
accumulation and mitochondria dysfunction [35]. Notably,
we found that pre-treatment with NAC rescued the
EM23-induced LC3-II accumulation observed previously
(Figure 10D), implying that EM23-induced autophagy was
mediated by EM23-induced ROS accumulation.
To investigate whether EM23-induced autophagy
imparted a protective or detrimental effect, cells were pretreated with 5 mM 3-MA prior to treatment with 15 μM
EM23. Cell growth and apoptosis were then determined by
MTT assay and Annexin-V-FITC/PI staining, respectively.
As shown in Figure 11A, the inhibitory effect of EM23
on cell growth was weakened by 3-MA treatment in

blotting. (B) After transfection for 24 h, CaSki and SiHa cells were treated with 15 µM EM23 for another 24 h. Apoptotic cells were then
analyzed by flow cytometry after Annexin-V-FITC/PI staining. Data are presented as the mean ± SD of three independent experiments.

both cell lines. These results were further verified by
Annexin-V-FITC/PI staining and flow cytometry analysis
(Figure 11B). These data indicate that EM23-induced
autophagy indeed had a detrimental effect on CaSki and
SiHa cells, and resulted in apoptosis.

status can activate the mitochondria-dependent apoptosis
pathway frequently observed in several representative
SLs, including helenalin [44], costunolide [45], and
parthenolide [46]. Here, we found that EM23 inhibited cell
growth, and facilitated apoptosis by promoting caspase and
PARP cleavage, as well as disruption of Δψm (Figure 2).
We also found that ROS accumulation was involved in
EM23-induced apoptosis in CaSki and SiHa cells, as the
ROS scavenger, NAC, almost completely reversed these
effects (Figure 3).
It is generally believed that one of the most
important molecular mechanisms for SL-induced
apoptosis involves the conjugation of their unsaturated
carbonyl structures to sulfhydryl groups. TrxR represents
a potential target of EM23 because its C-terminal active
site contains a highly reactive selenocysteine (Sec498)
residue essential for the catalytic activity of TrxR. The
ability of EM23 to inhibit the TrxR activity identifies it
as a molecular target of EM23 (Figure 4). BIAM-labeling
assays identified the C-terminal Sec498 as the primary
site of alkylation by EM23, a result further confirmed by
TOF LC-MS analysis of adduct of the C-terminal redoxactive motif of TrxR by EM23 and molecular docking
stimulation (Figure 5). Notably, the lactonic ring of EM23
was close to the redox-active site of TrxR as demonstrated
by the docking stimulation, which may allow the covalent
interactions occurring between EM23 and the Cys497 and
Sec498 simultaneously. Nevertheless, it is interesting that
both BIAM-labeling assays and TOF LC-MS analysis
demonstrated the selective alkylation of EM23 towards
only the Sec498, but not the neighboring Cys497. This may
be that the reactivity of the selenocysteine to electrophiles

DISCUSSION
The Trx/TrxR system, composed of TrxR, Trx,
and NADPH, is the major protein disulfide reduction
system of the cell [36]. The mammalian TrxR is a Seccontaining oxidoreductase previously identified as a
chemotherapeutic target in cancer cells and contains a
highly reactive selenocysteine susceptible to electrophilic
attack, which makes TrxR a suitable target for anticancer
drug development. To date, many synthetic and natural
therapeutic compounds that exhibit anticancer properties
have been classified as TrxR inhibitors. Prominent
examples include platinum drugs [37], gold compounds
[38], arsenic trioxide [39], curcumin [12], mercury [40],
motexafin gadolinium [41], nitroaromatic compounds
[42], and flavonoids [13], all of which have been evaluated
either as novel cancer treatments or adjuncts to existing
therapies. Our findings demonstrate that EM23 inhibits the
reduction activity of TrxR in cell-free systems (Figure 4A),
and is also sufficient to induce the downregulation of Trx
and TrxR in CaSki and SiHa cells (Figure 6).
Trx and TrxR have important roles in enzymatic
reductions and resistance against oxidative stress [43].
Generally, the inhibition of TrxR activity will directly
influence the redox functions of Trx, leading to a
disruption in cellular redox homeostasis. Disrupted redox

is greater than the cysteine, which was calculated to
be approximately 1000 times difference [47]. To our
knowledge, our study is the first report that SL compound
inhibits TrxR activity by specifically targeting the
C-terminal redox-active site Sec498.
TrxR inactivation can lead to an imbalance of
cellular redox state and regulation of Trx/TrxR systemrelated cell signal cascades. ASK1, a member of the
MAPK kinase kinase family, is an important signaling
molecule regulated by Trx/TrxR system. Under normal
conditions, inactivated ASK1 is bound to reduced
Trx; however, upon oxidative stress, ASK1 activates
when Trx redox state shifts to the oxidized form [48].
Indeed, our results demonstrate that ASK1 is released
from Trx following EM23 treatment (Figure 8A),
and subsequently activates, as demonstrated by the
increase in phosphorylation at Ser83 of ASK1. JNK,
one of the signal mediators downstream of ASK1, is
classified as stress-activated kinase and is activated by

a variety of stressors, including oxidative stress and
chemotherapeutic drugs [30]. The ROS-ASK1-JNK
signaling axis has important roles in oxidative stressinduced cell death and mostly required for oxidative
stress-induced apoptosis. JNK has been found to
regulate both pro-apoptotic and anti-apoptotic proteins,
such as c-Jun, 14-3-3, and Mcl-1 [49], that play key
roles in mitochondria-dependent apoptosis. In addition,
pretreatment with ASK1 and JNK-specific inhibitors,
or expression of dominant negative ASK1 and JNK
mutants, hindered cell apoptosis induced by various
types of stress [50–52], which is in agreement with our
observations (Figure 9), suggesting that EM23-induced
apoptosis is dependent on the ASK1/JNK pathway.
However, pro-apoptotic JNK activation could also be
regulated by other MAP3Ks, in addition to ASK1, such
as MEKK1 and MLK3. As such, further studies are
needed to determine whether ASK1 plays a critical role
in EM23-induced JNK activation.

Sustained exposure to oxidative stress is potentially
very harmful to cells. Among several intracellular
signaling pathways elicited by oxidative stress, the MAPK
cascade plays pivotal roles in regulating oxidative stressinduced cell death [30]. In our study, ROS scavenging,
which is upstream signal of MAPK, resulted in a reduction
of JNK activation and PARP cleavage (Figure 8C),
highlighting the important roles of ROS in EM23-induced
activation of JNK signal.
Many cancer cells have high levels of expression
of Trx and TrxR; therefore, it is not surprising that knock
down of TrxR in a mouse lung cancer cell line nearly
abolished their capacity to form xenograft tumors [7].
This seems contradictory to our founding. Interestingly,
a reduction of TrxR activity was observed in HeLa cells
following both siRNA-mediated knock down or treatment
with a therapeutic inhibitors; however, only the therapeutic
agents, but not the siRNA, resulted in increased oxidative

stress [53]. This indicates that residual TrxR1 activity
remaining upon TrxR1 knock down could still be enough
to counteract ROS. In addition, some compounds can also
convert TrxR to a ROS-generating enzyme and induce cell
apoptosis, in direct contrast to its usual role [42, 54, 55].
Furthermore, another report found that the TrxR system
was required for caspase 3 activation and apoptosis
[56], whereas we found that EM23-induced apoptosis
was partially dependent on a normal level of TrxR/Trx.
Nevertheless, more evidence is needed to illuminate
the precise mechanism of TrxR/Trx-dependent EM23induced apoptosis, including the effect of TrxR or Trx
knockdown on EM23-induced ROS accumulation, caspase
3 activation, and the MAPK pathway activation.
The phosphoinositide 3-phosphate kinase (PI3K)/
Akt/mTOR signaling pathway and the Ras/Raf1/ERK1/2
pathway are known to regulate autophagy in the cellular
response to nutrient starvation [31]. The PI3K/mTOR

and ERK1/2 pathways negatively and positively regulate
autophagy, respectively. Accumulating evidence has
shown that autophagy is activated in response to various
therapeutic agent treatments, including suberoylanilide
hydroxamic acid [57], vitamin K2 [58], Lapatinib [59],
and ursolic acid [60]. Furthermore, curcumin treatment
induced autophagic cell death in human malignant
glioma cells by inhibiting the mTOR/p70S6K and
activating the ERK1/2 pathways simultaneously [33],
whereas triterpenoid B-group soyasaponins worked by
inhibiting AKT signaling and enhancing ERK activity
[61]. Thus, Akt/mTOR inhibition and ERK activation
are probably common mechanisms of autophagy
induced by anticancer agents. In addition, recent studies
have shown that LC3 is processed by a specific protein
activation/conjugation system to form autophagosomal
membranes during autophagy [62]. In this study, we
found the reduction of Akt/mTOR signaling and the
enhanced conversion of LC3-I to LC3-II occurred in
a dose-dependent manner (Figure 10B and 10C). It is
interesting that a significant decrease was observed
in the phosphorylation level of P7S6K with EM23

treatment, whereas there was no obvious change in
that of 4E-BP1 in spite of the decrease of mTOR
phosphorylation (Figure 10C). It can be explained that
the selectivity and sensitivity of mTOR for its substrates
may be dependent on the integrity and configuration of
mTOR and a change in the phosphorylation status of
one mTOR substrate does not necessarily correlate with
changes in others [34]. Yip et al. have also reported that
rapamycin strongly declined P7S6K phosphorylation,
whereas its effect on 4E-BP1 was more variable [63]. In
addition, it should be noted that EM23 caused a slighter
decrease in phosphorylation level of S6 than that of
70S6K. This may be due to the other kinases such as
RSK that involve in regulating the phosphorylation of
S6 [64]. Although autophagy can be stimulated in many
tumor cells under therapeutic agent-induced stress,
the exact role of autophagy in cancer cell death is still
not clear. Notably, many anticancer drugs, including
bortezomib, resveratrol, sorafenib, histone deacetylase
inhibitors, chloroquine, sulforaphane, and mTOR
inhibitors, similarly engender autophagic cell death
[65]. Currently, induction of autophagic cell death has

been regarded as a potential method for cancer therapy.
Consistent with these findings, we found that EM23induced autophagy had an apoptosis-promoting effect
in both cell lines (Figure 11).
While the precise mechanism of autophagy remains
unclear, mitochondrial-originated ROS was thought to
play a central role in the induction of autophagy, and
could be significantly blocked by NAC, a ROS scavenger.
In this study, we found that LC3-II accumulation
was blocked by NAC pre-treatment (Figure 10D).
It is worthy noted that inhibition of ROS by NAC is able
to decrease not only ROS level but also mTOR activity
[66]. To a certain degree, the pre-treatment of NAC
might contribute to EM-23-induced autophagy and the
following apoptosis.
Interestingly, recent investigations have shown that
ginseng metabolite [67], isoorientin [35], polygonatum
cyrtonema [68]-induced autophagy results from ROS
accumulation and subsequent activation of the JNK
signaling. In this studies, we found that EM23-induced
accumulation of ROS occurred upstream of JNK

activation (Figure 8C), implying a causal role of JNK
signaling in EM23-induced autophagy. However, more
evidence is needed to solidify this mechanism.
In summary, our study demonstrated that EM23 was
an efficient anticancer agent in vitro, and was sufficient
to induce apoptosis in two human cervical cancer cell
lines, CaSki and SiHa (Figure 12). EM23 attenuated
TrxR activity by binding to the selenocysteine site of
TrxR and inhibited the expression levels of Trx/TrxR to
facilitate ROS accumulation, which played a central role
in EM23-induced apoptosis. In addition, inhibition of
Trx/TrxR system resulted in the dissociation of ASK1
from complex with Trx and activation of downstream
JNK signaling pathway, which contributed to EM23induced apoptosis. ROS also facilitated the activation of
JNK signaling pathway. Furthermore, EM23 inhibited
Akt/mTOR ribosomal protein-signaling pathway and
induced autophagy, which was proapoptotic and mediated
by ROS. This report represents the first comprehensive
analysis of mammalian TrxR and cellular signaling events
in response to the treatment of EM23 in human cervical

allowed to attach for about 12 h. Cells were then treated
with a range of EM23 concentrations. The medium was
removed 24 h later, and 50 µL of the same medium
containing 5 mg/mL MTT was added to each well, and
incubated for another 4 h. The medium was removed
again, and 100 µL DMSO was added to each well and
incubated for 15 min. Cell viability was determined by the
absorbance at 570 nm as measured by microplate reader
(Bio-Rad; Hercules, CA, USA), and the IC50 values of
EM23 for each cell line were calculated using Origin 8
software (OriginLab, Northampton, MA USA).

incubation, TrxR was incubated with 10 µM EM23 in
the above assay mixture for various time periods. TrxR
activity was measured by DTNB reduction assay and was
expressed as a percentage of the corresponding controls in
the absence of EM23.

Immunoprecipitation
For immunoprecipitation, equal amounts of protein
from lysates prepared as above were co-incubated with
Trx primary antibody and protein A magnetic beads
(Santa Cruz) at 4°C overnight. The pellet was washed
five times with ice-cold NP40 (Beyotime), resuspended
in SDS-loading buffer (Beyotime), and analyzed
by immunoblotting with Trx and ASK1 antibodies,
respectively.

BIAM-labeling assay
TrxR was incubated with EM23 in 20 mM TrisHCl, 1 mM EDTA pH 7.5, and 200 µM NADPH at
room temperature for 1 h, and then subjected to BIAM
alkylation in buffers containing 100 mM Tris-HCl and

were harvested following treatment with 5, 15, and
20 µM EM23 for 24 h, and total RNA was extracted using
Pure Link™ Viral RNA/DNA Kits (Invitrogen). The
quantitative PCR of Trx and TrxR mRNA was performed
using SYBR Green Real-time PCR Master Mix (Toyobo)
as described by the manufacturer. Gene-specific primer

5′-GCATAATGTTTATTGTCACG-3′, GAPAH sense
5′-CACCCAGAAGACTGTGGATGG-3′ and GAPDH
antisense 5′-GTCTACATGGCAACTGTGAGG-3′.

Molecular docking studies
Docking studies were performed using the molecular
modeling software package SYBYL 8.0 (Tripos, USA).
The ligand EM23 was charged with Gasteiger-Hückel and
minimized by using the Powell’s method with standard
Tripos force field with a 0.005 kcal/(mol*Å) gradient. The
maximum number of iterations during minimization was
1000. The minimum-energy structure was used for the
subsequent docking calculations. The initial 3D structure
of TrxR used for docking studies was retrieved from the
Protein Data Bank (PDB) with accession code 2ZZB. The
Surflex-Dock program implanted in SYBYL was used for
the docking calculations. To generate the Surflex-Dock
control file, the crystallographic ligand was extracted from
the binding site of TrxR, and the residues within a 5.0 Å
radius around the enzyme were defined as the active site.
MOLCAD surface displayed in Fast Connolly pattern was
generated for visualizing the binding mode of the docked
protein-ligand complexes.

Inhibition of TrxR in cell-free systems
TrxR (50 nM) and NADPH (200 µM) were
incubated in 100 mM potassium phosphate buffer
(pH 7.4) supplemented with 2 mM EDTA at room
temperature for 4–5 min. Various concentrations of EM23
were added to the mixture and incubated for another 5 min.
The reaction was started and TrxR activity was monitored
by the increase in absorbance at 412 nm in the initial 80s
after the addition of 2 mM 5,5′-dithiobis (2-nitrobenzoic
acid) acid (DTNB), where TrxR mediated the reduction of
DTNB into two molecules of 2-nitro-5-thiobenzoate anion
(TNB) in the presence of NADPH. TrxR activity was
expressed as percentage of control. For time-dependent
