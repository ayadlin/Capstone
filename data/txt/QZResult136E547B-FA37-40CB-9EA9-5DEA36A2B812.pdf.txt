BACKGROUND: Standard therapy for older patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) has a poor outcome. The authors have
designed a combination of clofarabine plus low-dose cytarabine followed by a prolonged consolidation alternating with decitabine.
METHODS: Sixty patients with a median age of 70 years (range, 60-81 years) with newly diagnosed AML were included. They
received clofarabine 20 mg/m2 intravenously daily for 5 days plus cytarabine 20 mg subcutaneously twice daily for 10 days.
Responding patients continued for up to 17 courses of consolidation therapy including decitabine. RESULTS: Forty of 59 evaluable
patients responded (66%). Complete remission rate was 58%. Median relapse-free survival (RFS) was 14.1 (95% confidence interval
[CI], 6.9 to not estimable), and median overall survival (OS) was 12.7 months (95% CI, 8.8 to not estimable). Median OS of responding
patients (complete response [CR]/CR with platelet count <100  109/L) was 24.2 months (95% CI, 17 to not estimable). Compared
with a historical group of patients who received clofarabine plus low-dose cytarabine with a shorter consolidation, RFS was not statistically different. Induction mortality was low (7% at 8 weeks) and toxicities manageable. CONCLUSIONS: Clofarabine plus low-dose
cytarabine alternating with decitabine in consolidation is active in older patients with newly diagnosed AML. The benefits of a proC 2012 American Cancer Society.

INTRODUCTION
Therapy for newly diagnosed patients 60 years with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) remains challenging, with low
response rates, short durability of responses, and a high risk of treatment-related toxicities after standard dose-intensive
therapy.1,2 Recent years have therefore seen a heightened level of activity in the exploration of new drugs and lowerintensity approaches.
Clofarabine is a deoxyadenosine nucleoside analog with US Food and Drug Administration approval for children
with relapsed acute lymphoblastic leukemia. The recommended phase 2 dose of clofarabine for adults with acute leukemias was 40 mg/m2 intravenously daily for 5 days.3 However, 2 large multicenter studies, from the United States and
Europe, respectively, have since shown that lower doses of clofarabine can improve the toxicity profile while still demonstrating activity in the up-front treatment of newly diagnosed older patients with AML.4,5
We have shown in a randomized trial that the combination of lower-dose clofarabine with low-dose cytarabine produced higher response rates with a comparable safety profile compared with single-agent clofarabine.6 However, beyond
achieving high remission rates, the ultimate goal is to improve survival. The current study was therefore designed with the
following rationale: 1) to deliver lower doses of clofarabine than in the previous study; 2) to expand the duration of therapy; and 3) to provide multiple drugs with different mechanisms of action to prevent cross-resistance. As an additional
drug to be administered during consolidation, we chose the DNA methyltransferase inhibitor decitabine. It can be delivered at low doses with acceptable toxicity and with activity in AML.7,8 We also compared survival and relapse-free survival
(RFS) between patients on the current study and a group of patients who received the combination therapy in a previous
protocol where the number of consolidation cycles was shorter and DNA methyltransferase inhibitors were not used.6

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients

Sixty patients were enrolled between October 2008 and
January 2010, of whom 59 were evaluable for response.
Patients were eligible if they were 60 years of age with a
diagnosis of previously untreated AML (based on World
Health Organization [WHO] criteria) or high-risk
myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS; 10% blasts or
intermediate-2 by the International Prognostic Scoring
System). Prior therapy with hydroxyurea and biological or
targeted therapy were allowed. No patients received prior
clofarabine or decitabine, although previous use of azacitidine was permissible. Additional requirements included
an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 2 and adequate organ function
(serum total bilirubin 2 mg/dL, alanine aminotransferase or aspartate aminotransferase 4  the upper limit of
normal, serum creatinine 2 mg/dL, and cardiac ejection
fraction [by either echocardiography or multigated acquisition scan] of >40%). The study was approved by the
institutional review board of The University of Texas MD
Anderson Cancer Center and was conducted in accordance with the basic principles of the Declaration of
Helsinki. All patients provided written informed consent
according to institutional guidelines.
Treatment Design and Monitoring

Induction therapy consisted of clofarabine 20 mg/m2 by
intravenous infusion daily for 5 days on days 1 to 5 plus
cytarabine 20 mg subcutaneously twice daily for 10 days
on days 1 to 10. On days 1 through 5, clofarabine preceded the cytarabine injections by about 3 to 4 hours.6
Patients who did not achieve a complete remission (CR)
could receive 1 reinduction cycle at the same dose and
schedule but not before at least 28 days had passed after
the start of cycle 1. In the case of persistent disease after
reinduction, patients could proceed with decitabine
20 mg/m2 as a 1- to 2-hour intravenous infusion daily for
5 days on days 1 to 5 as an alternative attempt to achieve a
remission. Once in remission, patients would receive up
to 17 cycles of consolidation therapy. Consolidation was
administered in blocks of 3 cycles where clofarabine plus
cytarabine at an abbreviated schedule alternated with decitabine (Fig. 1). Consolidation cycles were repeated every
4 to 7 weeks depending on hematopoietic recovery (absolute neutrophil count [ANC] 1  109/L and platelet
count 50  109/L) and resolution of toxicities (any nonhematologic toxicity had to return at least to grade 1).
It was recommended that all patients receive cycle 1
of the induction in a laminar air flow room, where they
4472

stayed hospitalized for the duration of the induction (on
average 30 days). Patients received anti-infectious prophylaxis consisting of levofloxacin, valacyclovir, and voriconazole (or equivalent). To avoid hepatotoxicity, the latter was
withheld on the first 5 days while clofarabine was administered. Hematopoietic growth factors (eg, erythropoietin,
filgrastim, pegfilgrastim, sargramostim) were used at the
discretion of the treating physician. Antiemetic therapy was
routinely provided as appropriate. The patients’ fluid status
and hepatic and renal function were carefully monitored
daily during the drug administration period.
Patients were monitored with complete blood count
(CBC), differential and platelet count, and chemistry profile daily during induction and then at least weekly (CBC)
or every 2 to 4 weeks (chemistry) as long as they were
receiving drug therapy. Repeat marrow aspirates were performed starting on day 21 and then at least every 2 weeks
until confirmation of remission or nonresponse. For most
patients, this occurred within 42 days.
Response Criteria

Response was assessed based on criteria by the International Working Group for Diagnosis, Standardization of
Response Criteria, Treatment Outcomes, and Reporting
Standards for Therapeutic Trials in Acute Myeloid Leukemia.9 CR required an ANC of 1  109/L, platelet count
of 100  109/L, and marrow blasts 5%. CRp was
defined as CR but with platelet counts <100  109/L.
Any other response was considered treatment failure.
Statistical Considerations

The primary objective of this phase 2 trial was to determine RFS and overall survival (OS). Stopping boundaries
were developed for monitoring efficacy and safety. Patient
characteristics were summarized using frequency (percentage) for categorical variables and median (range) for continuous variables. Fisher exact test was used to assess the
differences in categorical variables between patients
accrued on the historical and current trials, respectively.
Wilcoxon rank sum test was used to compare continuous
variables. OS was defined as the time interval between the
date of treatment and the date of death from any cause or
last follow-up date, whichever occurred first. Among
patients who achieved CR or CRp, RFS was defined as
the time interval between the date of response (ie, CR or
CRp) and the date of relapse or date of death, whichever
occurred first. CR or CRp patients who were alive and
relapse-free were censored at the off-study date. OS and
RFS were estimated using the method of Kaplan and
Meier.10 Log-rank test was used to compare OS or RFS
between patients treated in the 2 trials.11 Univariate and

RESULTS
Study Group

Characteristics for all patients (current and historical) are
summarized in Table 1. Among the current group of
patients, all had a diagnosis of AML (WHO).9 Patients
with unfavorable pretreatment characteristics included
those with age 75 years (29%), those with an ECOG
performance status of 2 (18%), those with secondary
AML with an antecedent hematologic disorder (23%),
and those with complex cytogenetic abnormalities (33%).
Cancer

September 15, 2012

Of the 14 patients with antecedent hematologic disorder,
11 had a diagnosis of MDS. Four of these patients
received prior azacitidine (1 in combination with an investigational histone deacetylase inhibitor). Other treatments
for MDS that preceded enrollment into the study
included hematopoietic growth factors (erythropoietin,
darbepoietin, filgrastim), lenalidomide, cyclosporine and
prednisone (in 1 patient with hypoplastic MDS), and the
PR-1 vaccine. Two patients had a preceding diagnosis of
chronic myelomonocytic leukemia and 1 of a myeloproliferative neoplasm, not otherwise specified. The latter 3
patients received hydroxyurea at some point prior. The
other 18 patients with nonhematologic pre-existing
malignancies received either chemotherapy, radiation, or
both. Patients who were treated with surgery only were
not included in this group.

Outcome
Response

Fifty-nine patients were evaluable for response. One
patient elected not to continue and was taken off study by
day 6 before a response assessment was possible. Forty
patients (66%) responded; 35 (58%) achieved CR and 5
(8%) CRp. Seven patients (18%; 5 with CR and 2 with
CRp) required at least 2 cycles to respond. Median time to
CR was 38 days (range, 27-103 days). For patients with
CRp, median time to establishing the response was 83 days
(range, 25-177 days). Responding patients received a median of 4 consolidation cycles (range, 0-17). Eight (20%)
patients received at least 10 consolidation cycles, and consolidation therapy was still ongoing in 14 (35%) patients.
Responses by subgroup are summarized in Table 2.
Responses (CR and overall response rate [ORR]) were
numerically lower in patients with an antecedent hematoTable 1. Patient Characteristics

Conversely, all of the 7 patients with an FLT3 internal
tandem duplication abnormality responded, which
included CR in 6 (86%).
RFS and OS

The median follow-up is 19.6 months. Among the
40 patients who have achieved CR/CRp, 24 patients
(60%) later relapsed or died, and the median RFS was
14.1 months (95% confidence interval [CI], 6.9 to not
estimable). Among the 60 patients, 34 (57%) died, and the
median OS was 12.7 months (95% CI, 8.8 to not estimable). Median OS of responding patients only (CR/CRp)
was 24.2 months (95% CI, 17.0 to not estimable; Fig. 2).
We compared OS and RFS to a historical group of
79 patients. This group of patients was enrolled on a separate clinical study from August 2004 to June 2006 and
received induction therapy with clofarabine 30 mg/m2
intravenously daily for 5 days plus cytarabine 20 mg/m2
subcutaneously daily for 14 days. Consolidation consisted
of 3 days of clofarabine and 7 days of cytarabine without
inclusion of a hypomethylating agent.6 All other supportive care and monitoring parameters were the same. There
were no statistically significant differences in the characteristics between the 2 patient groups (Table 1). Response
rates in the historical group were also statistically similar
(CR 62%, CRp 5%, ORR 67%).
With a median follow-up of 62.9 months, the
median RFS of the historical group of patients was 9.3
months (95% CI, 6.2-12). There was no significant difference between the current and historical groups of
patients with respect to RFS (P ¼ .24, log-rank test; Fig. 3).
Table 3 shows the fitted univariate Cox proportional hazards regression models for RFS, which suggest that older
age was significantly associated with an increased risk of
relapse or death after achievement of CR/CRp. The fitted
multivariate Cox model for RFS suggests that after adjusting for age, there was no significant difference between

The median OS of the 79 historical patients was
11.5 months (95% CI, 8.4-18.2 months), with no significant difference between the current and historical groups

AML, karyotype other than diploid, and a performance

risk of death. Only after adjusting in a fitted multivariate

Adverse events

Adverse events are summarized in Table 5, with
grade and frequency. Most toxicities did not exceed grade
2. Gastrointestinal-related adverse events including nausea and vomiting, increases of total bilirubin and transaminases, and diarrhea were observed most frequently,
followed by skin rashes including palmoplantar dysesthesia in few patients.
Seven patients died while on study. Four of these
patients (7%) died within the first 8 weeks of study enrollment. No early deaths within the first 14 days occurred.
Only 1 patient died while undergoing consolidation

DISCUSSION
The combination of clofarabine with low-dose cytarabine
followed by a prolonged consolidation with alternating
decitabine achieved a response rate of 66% (58% CR),
median RFS of 14.1 months, and median OS of 12.7
months. Median OS of responding patients (CR/CRp)
was 24.2 months. Eight-week mortality was 7%, and
most patients had manageable toxicities of grade 2.
The study design was based on our previous experience with the combination of clofarabine and low-dose
cytarabine alone without the addition of decitabine. The
rationale of this study was to attenuate induction doses to
minimize early mortality, enable delivery of a more
extended postremission therapy, and include a third drug
with activity in AML that is non cross-resistant and might
circumvent buildup of drug resistance to the 2-drug combination. The first 2 goals have been largely achieved;
induction mortality (measured at 8 weeks to incorporate
effects of drug-related toxicity and of resistant disease) has
been low, and whereas a fifth of the patients received at
least 10 consolidation cycles, consolidation is ongoing in
another third of the patients. Hence, it is feasible to provide extended therapy with this regimen. As for the third
goal, circumvention of drug resistance by adding additional drugs (in this case decitabine), it remains largely
speculative. It will also remain difficult to answer in the
absence of a direct randomized comparison. We therefore
compared the long-term outcome of patients who
received clofarabine and low-dose cytarabine in a previous
study without decitabine with the current study.6 It needs
to be emphasized, however, that there were other differences in the historical group; the induction dose of clofarabine was higher (30 mg/m2 daily  5 days), the schedule
of low-dose cytarabine was different (20 mg/m2 daily 

14 days), and the number of consolidation cycles administered was lower (median of 2). With these caveats in
mind, response rates were identical, although induction
mortality appeared higher (19%) in the historical group.
More importantly, RFS and OS were not different unless
an alternative multivariate Cox model was applied that
included information from baseline cytogenetics.
Comparisons with induction therapies that use singleagent decitabine only are also limited. The 2 studies by
Cashen et al and Blum et al, respectively, differed in the
number of days of decitabine per cycle (5 vs 10).7,8 Whereas
the overall response with the 5-day schedule has been only
25% (24% CR), the ORR with the 10-day schedule has
been 64% (47% CR). The differences extended to median
survival: 7.7 months with the 5-day schedule (14 months
for responders only) versus 13 months (no information
regarding responders only) with the 10-day schedule.
One of the major issues debated with regard to
induction therapy for older patients with AML is the value
of standard or intensive therapy. The historical experience
based on the 3 þ 7 schedule is sobering. CR rates are typically <50%, most patients relapse quickly, and 3-year survival expectations are <10%.13,14 The value of intensive
chemotherapy for older patients has been recently analyzed
Cancer

September 15, 2012

Elderly AML Induction/Faderl et al

in a retrospective study by Kantarjian et al.1 Of 446
patients 70 years of age treated with cytarabine-based
therapy, CR rate was 45%, 8-week mortality 36%, median
survival 4.6 months, and 1-year survival probability 28%.
Juliusson from the Swedish AML Group argued against the
conclusion that intensive therapy benefits few older patients
with AML.15 Data from the Swedish Acute Leukemia
Registry showed that 55% of 70- to 79-year-olds received
intensive therapy, and half of those treated achieved CR.
Outcomes were clearly better when compared with patients
who opted for or received only palliative care. Conversely,
the registry experience does not provide any comparisons
of different treatment approaches with each other, and it
remains therefore impossible to assess the value of established, intensive therapy vis-à-vis novel therapies.
Despite the conservative doses, this treatment causes
myelosuppression, with its accompanying risks of infectious complications, and has several other adverse events
typical for chemotherapy regimens (see Table 5). To treat
patients with this combination requires meticulous observation and follow-up. We admitted all our patients to a
laminar airflow room during their first induction cycle, and
all received broad-spectrum antibiotic prophylaxis (antibacterial, antifungal, and antiviral agents). It does, however,
provide a different approach based on attenuated induction
and consolidation doses (validated by low mortality rates),
changing drugs during consolidation, and a prolonged
number of consolidation cycles. Both remission and survival rates confirm the activity of this regimen. Where it
will be positioned among other approaches and in comparison to conventional therapy (such as 3 þ 7) cannot be
answered from our study, but requires a more concerted
effort of a larger randomized study. These regimens are not
mutually exclusive. With better definitions of subsets of
patients, there is likely to be a role for conventional therapy
in some, whereas investigational therapies are more appropriate for others. In this respect, various prognostic models
aid the decision-making process, and investigators should
be encouraged to use them.16-18
