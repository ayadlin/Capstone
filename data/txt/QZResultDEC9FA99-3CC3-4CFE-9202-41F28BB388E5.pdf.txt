Angiotensin-(1-7) Reduces Fibrosis in Orthotopic
Breast Tumors

Abstract
Angiotensin-(1-7) [Ang-(1-7)] is an endogenous 7–amino acid peptide hormone of the renin-angiotensin
system that has antiproliferative properties. In this study, Ang-(1-7) inhibited the growth of cancer-associated
fibroblasts (CAF) and reduced fibrosis in the tumor microenvironment. A marked decrease in tumor volume
and weight was observed in orthotopic human breast tumors positive for the estrogen receptor (BT-474 or
ZR-75-1) and HER2 (BT-474) following Ang-(1-7) administration to athymic mice. Ang-(1-7) concomitantly
reduced interstitial fibrosis in association with a significant decrease in collagen I deposition, along with a
similar reduction in perivascular fibrosis. In CAFs isolated from orthotopic breast tumors, the heptapeptide
markedly attenuated in vitro growth as well as reduced fibronectin, transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β), and
extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 kinase activity. An associated increase in the mitogen-activated protein
kinase (MAPK) phosphatase DUSP1 following treatment with Ang-(1-7) suggested a potential mechanism by
which the heptapeptide reduced MAPK signaling. Consistent with these in vitro observations, immunohistochemical analysis of Ang-(1-7)–treated orthotopic breast tumors revealed reduced TGF-β and increased
DUSP1. Together, our findings indicate that Ang-(1-7) targets the tumor microenvironment to inhibit CAF
growth and tumor fibrosis. Cancer Res; 70(21); 8319–28. ©2010 AACR.

Introduction
Cross talk between cancer cells and surrounding tissue is
essential for the development and progression of tumors.
The interaction between cancerous cells and the adjacent
microenvironment transforms the stroma into an abnormal
phenotype, altering normal function (1, 2). The altered stromal microenvironment affects tissue architecture, cellular
morphology, and extracellular matrix (ECM)–cell interactions that directly contribute to formation of the neoplasia
(1). Solid tumors, in particular breast tumors, are characterized by pathologic desmoplasia, resulting in increased fibrosis and ECM deposition (1, 2). About 80% of reactive stroma
associated with breast carcinoma is composed of activated
myofibroblasts (3), which secrete ECM proteins, resulting
in desmoplasia and breast tumor progression (4).
Activated myofibroblasts play a vital role in tumor initiation, growth, and metastases. Tumor stroma myofibroblasts
or “cancer-associated fibroblasts” (CAF) are characterized
by their expression profile and are distinguished from nor-

mal fibroblasts by the expression of α-smooth muscle
actin (α-SMA) and vimentin (5). Moreover, the presence of
α-SMA–positive myofibroblasts around noninvasive epithelium
in breast ductal carcinoma in situ is strongly correlated with
the onset of tumor invasion and poor prognosis (5, 6). Inflammation and cytokine secretion by cancer cells result
in the recruitment of CAF to the tumor site. Activated myofibroblasts are transformed by cytokines such as transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) and secrete tumor-promoting
growth factors including hepatocyte growth factor (HGF),
platelet-derived growth factor, vascular endothelial growth
factor (VEGF), basic fibroblast growth factor, TGF-α, and
TGF-β (5), which leads to the production of ECM components including collagens, tenascin-C, and fibronectin (7).
CAFs play an important role in the initiation and progression of cancer; however, cancer therapies that target the
tumor stroma are limited (5, 8). In this study, we assessed
whether angiotensin-(1-7) [Ang-(1-7)], a 7–amino acid peptide hormone of the renin-angiotensin system with vasodilatory, antiproliferative, and antifibrotic properties (9), alters
the tumor microenvironment to reduce tumor growth and fibrosis. Ang-(1-7) exerts its biological activity through a unique
G protein–coupled receptor, mas (9, 10). The heptapeptide
decreased mitogen-stimulated growth of vascular smooth
muscle cells (VSMC) in vitro (11) and attenuated neointima
formation in a balloon catheter injury model of the rat carotid
artery, with no effect on the underlying media layer, indicating that the antigrowth properties of the heptapeptide are
limited to proliferating cells (12). In a retrospective study of
hypertensive patients treated with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors that increase Ang-(1-7), ACE inhibitor

treatment reduced the risk of cancer, particularly lung
and breast cancer (13). More importantly, we showed that
Ang-(1-7) significantly decreased the proliferation of human
lung cancer cells in vitro by reducing mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) activity (14). Ang-(1-7) infusion decreased
human A549 lung adenocarcinoma xenograft growth with a
corresponding reduction in cyclooxygenase-2 (15). Lung
tumors from mice injected with the heptapeptide had reduced vessel density with an associated decrease in VEGF, indicating that Ang-(1-7) inhibited tumor angiogenesis (16).
These data suggested that Ang-(1-7) also regulates the tumor
microenvironment to inhibit cancer growth.
Fibrosis correlates with the progression and invasion of
breast cancer. The increased ECM deposition and secretion
of growth factors by myofibroblasts directly contribute to
breast tumor growth by stimulating tumor cell proliferation,
increasing angiogenesis, and promoting invasion (5). The
purpose of this study was to determine whether Ang-(1-7)
could serve as an antifibrotic agent that targets the tumor
microenvironment to reduce breast cancer tumor growth
and fibrosis.

Orthotopic model of human breast cancer
Female athymic mice (15–20 g, 4–6 weeks of age; Charles
River Laboratories) were housed in cages with high-efficiency
particle arrest–filtered air (12-hour light dark cycle) and
provided ad libitum access to food and autoclaved water. All
procedures complied with the policies of the Wake Forest University Animal Care and Use Committee. Female athymic mice
were ovariectomized and supplemented with 0.18 mg 17βestradiol 90-day time release pellets (Innovative America) to
prevent cycling of hormones (17, 18). Actively growing ZR75-1 cells (2 × 106) or BT-474 cells (5 × 106) at 75% confluence
were suspended in 50% PBS/50% Matrigel and injected into the
inguinal mammary fat pad (19, 20). Tumor size was measured
every other day using a caliper, and tumor volume was calculated using the formula V = [(length × width2)/2]. When tumors
reached a volume of 100 mm3 (ZR-75-1) or 200 mm3 (BT-474),
the mice were implanted with osmotic minipumps for s.c. release of saline or 24 μg/kg/h Ang-(1-7). After 18 days of treatment, the animals were sacrificed and tumors were excised.
Immunohistochemistry
Paraformaldehye-fixed, paraffin-embedded tumors were
cut into 5-μm-thick sections and stained with H&E to determine morphology. Interstitial and perivascular fibrosis was
measured by picrosirius red histochemical staining (21). Immunostaining was performed with an antibody to collagen I
(1:100) using the streptavidin-biotin method (22). Immunostaining for TGF-β (1:100), DUSP1 (1:200), and vimentin
(1:100) was performed using FITC-coupled Cy2 or Cy3 as secondary antibodies and counterstained with 4′,6-diamidino-2phenylindole (DAPI). Stained sections were visualized with a
Leica DM 4000 microscope (Amax = 492 nm Cy2, Amax = 550 nm
Cy3 for fluorescence) and photographed with a QImaging Retiga 1300R camera. A computer-assisted counting technique
with a pixel counter to select stained fibers was used to quantify picrosirius red and collagen I staining. Interstitial fibrosis
was expressed as a percentage of reactive fibers/field (four
fields/tumor section/mouse), whereas perivascular fibrosis
was expressed as a percentage of reactive fibers/blood vessel
(four vessels/tumor section/mouse).
Tumor fibroblast isolation
Orthotopic ZR-75-1 breast tumors (200 mm3) were excised
from mammary fat pads. Minced tumors were digested overnight at 4°C with trypsin (50 μg/mL), and soybean trypsin
inhibitor (100 μg/mL) was added to stop the reaction. The
minced tissue, harvested by centrifugation, was further digested with collagenase (85 units/mL) at 37°C for 30 minutes.
Undigested tumor tissue was removed with a cell strainer,
and tumor fibroblasts were isolated by differential plating
as previously described (23).
Quantification of cell number
Isolated tumor fibroblasts (1 × 104 cells/mL) in DMEM/F12
containing 0.5% FBS and 10 ng/mL TGF-β were treated with
PBS or 100 nmol/L Ang-(1-7) in PBS, added daily due to degradation of the heptapeptide. Cell number was determined
using a hemocytometer.

Ang-(1-7) Reduces Breast Tumor Fibrosis

Figure 1. Effect of Ang-(1-7)
on orthotopic human breast
cancer growth. The volumes of
human ZR-75-1 (A) or BT-474 (B)
orthotopic breast tumors from
mice treated with saline or Ang-(1-7)
were measured using a caliper,
calculated as V = 1/2(L × W2), and
presented as the percent change
compared with initial tumor
volume. ZR-75-1 (C) or BT-474 (D)
tumor weight from mice infused
with saline or Ang-(1-7) was
determined at time of sacrifice
(n = 5–6). *, P < 0.05.

Immunofluorescence
Fibroblasts were fixed with paraformaldehyde, permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100, and incubated overnight at
4°C with antibodies to fibronectin, vimentin, α-SMA, or
collagen I (1:100). Following a 30-minute incubation with
Cy2- or Cy3-labeled antibodies (1:100), the cells were counterstained with DAPI.
Western blot hybridization
Treated cell monolayers were solubilized in lysis buffer
(14), and protein was measured by a modification of the
Lowry method (24). Proteins were separated by PAGE and
transferred to hydrophobic polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. Nonspecific binding was blocked by incubation with
Blotto (TBS with 5% powdered milk and 0.1% Tween 20).
Membranes were incubated overnight at 4°C with primary
antibodies specific to DUSP1 (MKP-1, 1:1,000), fibronectin
(1:5,000), and pERK1/2 or TGF-β (1:1,000), followed by a
1-hour incubation with polyclonal HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies (1:2,000) at room temperature. Immunoreactive products were visualized by chemiluminescence
(SuperSignal Femto or Pico West, Pierce Biotechnology)
and quantified by densitometry using MCID digital densitometry software. Protein loading was visualized by incubation of stripped membranes with a monoclonal antibody to
β-actin (1:2,000).
Statistics
All data are presented as the mean ± SE. Statistical differences were evaluated by Student's t test or one-way ANOVA

followed by Dunnett's post hoc test. The criterion for statistical significance was set at P < 0.05.

Results
Inhibition of orthotopic human breast tumors
by Ang-(1-7)
Athymic mice bearing human ZR-75-1 or BT-474 orthotopic
breast tumors were administered saline or 24 μg/kg/h Ang(1-7) via osmotic minipump. The ZR-75-1 tumor volume in
the two treatment groups was not statistically different at the
beginning of treatment [117.3 ± 4.3 mm3 in the saline-treated
group when compared with 123.8 ± 7.6 mm3 in the Ang-(1-7)–
treated group]. Tumor volume of saline-medicated mice
continued to increase, whereas the growth of tumors in
Ang-(1-7)–treated mice was significantly inhibited beginning
at day 4 of treatment [day 18 tumor volumes: 287.4 ± 22.2%
change in the saline-treated mice compared with 59.7 ± 9.8%
change in the Ang-(1-7)–treated animals when compared with
original tumor volume; P < 0.001; Fig. 1A]. By the end of the
study, the volume of ZR-75-1 tumors from Ang-(1-7)–medicated
mice was reduced by 25% compared with the initial tumor volume, resulting in a %T/C [(average relative tumor volume of the
treated group/average relative tumor volume of the control
group) ×100] of 22.3%. Due to the diminished size of the tumors
from mice administered Ang-(1-7), the study was terminated at
18 days to provide sufficient tumor tissue for mechanistic studies.
The tumor volume of the two treatment groups of athymic
mice injected with human BT-474 breast cancer cells was
not statistically different at the beginning of treatment

[327.0 ± 72.5 mm3 in the saline-treated group compared with
197.7 ± 15.9 mm3 in the Ang-(1-7)–administered group]. The
volume of the tumors in saline-treated mice continued to increase, whereas the growth of tumors from the heptapeptidemedicated animals was inhibited significantly beginning at
day 12 [final tumor volumes: 1,818 ± 260.2% change in the
saline-treated animals compared with 841.2 ± 24.9% change
in the Ang-(1-7)–treated animals when compared with initial
tumor volumes; P < 0.001; Fig. 1B]. Ang-(1-7) administration of
BT-474 orthotopic human breast tumors resulted in a %T/C of
29.9%. The study was terminated at 18 days for health concerns due to the large tumor burden of the saline-treated mice.
No gross pathologic side effects were observed with heptapeptide administration; there was no change in motor
function, body weight, and food and water intake. No metastases were observed in mice with ZR-75-1 or BT-474 tumors
due to the short time of the study. On completion of the study,
the mice were euthanized and tumors were excised and
weighed. The ZR-75-1 tumors from mice treated with Ang-(1-7)
weighed ∼50% less than the tumors from the saline control
animals (0.29 ± 0.03 g versus 0.14 ± 0.02 g; Fig. 1C). Similarly,
the BT-474 tumors from mice that were medicated with
Ang-(1-7) weighed ∼40% less than the tumors from the mice
treated with saline (3.62 ± 0.25 g versus 2.22 ± 0.07 g; Fig. 1D).
Inhibition of tumor fibrosis by Ang-(1-7)
Interstitial tumoral fibrosis was quantified in orthotopic
breast tumor sections stained with picrosirius red, a non-

specific collagen stain. ZR-75-1 and BT-474 tumors from
saline-treated mice displayed heavy deposits of collagen,
which were reduced by Ang-(1-7) administration (Fig. 2A
and B). The relative amount of picrosirius red staining
was quantified, and the amount of collagen within the tumors was expressed as percent fibrosis per field. Treatment
with the heptapeptide reduced interstitial fibrosis by 64% in
the ZR-75-1 tumors (23.3 ± 2.4% versus 8.3 ± 0.8% fibrosis
per field; Fig. 2A) and by 75% in the BT-474 tumors (4.9 ±
1.0% versus 1.2 ± 0.2% fibrosis per field; Fig. 2B), indicating
that Ang-(1-7) reduces tumor fibrosis in orthotopic breast
tumors. ZR-75-1 tumors from saline-treated mice had 3-fold
more interstitial fibrosis when compared with BT-474 tumors from saline-treated mice, showing a differential deposition of collagen between the two types of breast tumors.
The amount of picrosirius red staining surrounding blood
vessels in BT-474 tumors was also quantified to measure
perivascular fibrosis. It was not possible to quantify perivascular fibrosis in ZR-75-1 tumors due to pervasive interstitial
fibrosis throughout the tumor. Heavy deposits of collagen
were visualized around blood vessels in BT-474 tumors
from saline-treated animals, whereas tumor sections from
Ang-(1-7)–medicated animals had reduced perivascular
fibrosis. The heptapeptide decreased collagen deposition
around the blood vessels by 73% (49.3 ± 3.2% versus 13.4 ±
2.2% fibrosis per blood vessel; Fig. 2C), suggesting that
Ang-(1-7) reduces both interstitial and perivascular fibrosis
in breast tumors.

Ang-(1-7) Reduces Breast Tumor Fibrosis

Interstitial fibrosis in orthotopic breast tumors was further
characterized by the immunoreactivity of collagen I, one of
the main isoforms of collagen found in fibrotic breast tissue.
Representative pictures of collagen I immunoreactivity in
ZR-75-1 and BT-474 tumor sections are shown in Fig. 3A
and B, respectively. Ang-(1-7) reduced collagen I deposition
by 80% in ZR-75-1 orthotopic breast tumors [16.2 ± 1.7% per
field in the tumors of saline-treated mice versus 3.3 ± 0.9%
per field in tumors from Ang-(1-7)–treated mice], whereas
a 78% decrease in collagen I deposition was observed in
the BT-474 tumors [3.3 ± 0.7% per field in the tumors of
saline-treated animals when compared with 0.7 ± 0.1% per
field in tumors from Ang-(1-7)–medicated animals].
Inhibition of tumor-associated fibroblast growth
by Ang-(1-7)
Fibroblasts were isolated from ZR-75-1 tumors to identify
the molecular mechanism for the Ang-(1-7)–mediated
reduction in tumor fibrosis. Tumor-associated fibroblasts,
isolated by differential plating, were characterized as myofibroblasts by positive immunoreactivity to fibronectin, vimentin, collagen I, and α-SMA (Fig. 4A). The percent of

cells that showed positive immunoreactivity for fibronectin,
vimentin, and α-SMA was determined in sequentially passaged tumoral fibroblasts to determine whether the cells
maintain their phenotype as activated myofibroblasts with
time in culture. As shown in Fig. 4B, fibroblasts isolated
from orthotopic tumors retained the activated myofibroblast
phenotype until passage 5; therefore, only cells from passages 2 to 4 were used for in vitro experiments.
Isolated tumoral fibroblasts were treated with PBS or
100 nmol/L Ang-(1-7) daily for 10 days, and the cells were
counted using a hemocytometer, as a measure of cell proliferation. Ang-(1-7) significantly reduced the growth of cultured
myofibroblasts isolated from orthotopic breast tumors at
days 4, 7, and 10, with a 33% reduction in cell growth at day
10 [10,700 ± 400 PBS-treated myofibroblasts versus 7,000 ± 200
Ang-(1-7)–treated myofibroblasts; Fig. 5A].
Ang-(1-7) reduces MAPK activity by upregulation of a
MAPK phosphatase
pERK1/2 is a potent mitogenic signaling protein implicated
in cell survival, growth, and proliferation. pERK1/2 was measured by Western blot hybridization in protein homogenates

from myofibroblasts stimulated with 10 ng/mL TGF-β and
treated with PBS or 100 nmol/L Ang-(1-7) to determine
if the heptapeptide regulates phosphorylated MAPKs.
Ang-(1-7) decreased pERK1 by 47% and pERK2 by 63%
[1.13 ± 0.23 relative density units (RDU) in PBS-treated cells
versus 0.60 ± 0.06 RDU in Ang-(1-7)–treated cells for pERK1,
and 2.27 ± 0.56 RDU in PBS-treated cells versus 0.84 ± 0.08
RDU in Ang-(1-7)–treated cells for pERK2; Fig. 5B], indicating that the Ang-(1-7)–mediated antiproliferative effect may
be due to a reduction in pERK1/2.
MAPKs are phosphorylated and activated by MAPK kinases and dephosphorylated and inactivated by MAPK
phosphatases. DUSP1 (dual specificity phosphatase 1), a
MAPK phosphatase that dephosphorylates and inactivates
ERK1/2, was upregulated 2.52 ± 0.29–fold by Ang-(1-7) in
tumor-associated fibroblasts, suggesting that the heptapeptide may reduce pERK1/2 by upregulation of the MAPK
phosphatase DUSP1 (Fig. 5C). Pretreatment with the
Ang-(1-7) receptor [AT(1-7)R] antagonist D-[Ala7]-Ang-(1-7)
or D-[Pro 7 ]-Ang-(1-7) (100 nmol/L) completely blocked

the Ang-(1-7)–mediated increase in DUSP1 (Fig. 5D),
whereas the antagonists alone had no effect, indicating
that Ang-(1-7) activated an AT(1-7) receptor to increase
DUSP1 in tumor-associated fibroblasts.
Ang-(1-7) reduces TGF-β1 and fibronectin in
tumoral fibroblasts
TGF-β1 is a potent stimulator of fibroblast activation
that transforms fibroblasts to secreting myofibroblasts.
TGF-β1 was quantified by Western blot hybridization in
protein homogenates from myofibroblasts isolated from
orthotopic breast tumors and treated with PBS or 100 nm
Ang-(1-7) for 24 hours. Ang-(1-7) reduced TGF-β1 by 45.4 ±
11.7% in myofibroblasts compared with controls (Fig. 6A).
Because TGF-β1 stimulates myofibroblasts to synthesize
and deposit ECM proteins, myofibroblasts were stimulated
with 10 ng/mL TGF-β1 and treated with either PBS or
100 nmol/L Ang-(1-7) for 24 hours to determine if the heptapeptide regulated fibronectin synthesis. Ang-(1-7) administration decreased fibronectin by 37.5 ± 12.0% compared
with the control (Fig. 6B), suggesting that Ang-(1-7) reduces
fibronectin synthesis to attenuate ECM protein deposition,
fibrosis, and fibronectin signaling.
Sections from ZR-75-1 tumors in mice treated with saline
or Ang-(1-7) were incubated with antibodies to TGF-β1
(Fig. 6C) or DUSP1 (Fig. 6D) and vimentin. TGF-β1 immunoreactivity was reduced and DUSP1 immunoreactivity was
increased in perivascular fibroblasts identified by positive immunoreactivity to the vimentin antibody and by vascular
morphology in mice treated with Ang-(1-7) compared with
saline, in agreement with studies in isolated tumor-associated
fibroblasts.

tumoral fibroblasts were incubated with antibodies to vimentin,

The link between fibrosis and breast cancer is well established. Collagen I deposition in the breast leads to increased
mammographic density, which correlates with breast cancer
risk (25). Increased ECM remodeling and stiffening by
collagen and fibronectin enhances tumor cell survival and
proliferation (26). Moreover, the secretion of growth factors,
cytokines, and proangiogenic peptides by myofibroblasts
promotes breast tumor growth (5). The present study is
the first to show that Ang-(1-7) reduces the growth of human
breast orthotopic tumors with a corresponding decrease in
tumoral fibrosis. The reduction in interstitial and perivascular fibrosis was associated with a decrease in collagen I deposition. The heptapeptide reduced the serum-stimulated
proliferation of isolated tumoral fibroblasts, suggesting that
Ang-(1-7) inhibits myofibroblast growth to reduce tumor fibrosis. The reduction in fibroblast proliferation by Ang-(1-7)
was associated with increased DUSP1 and a corresponding
decrease in pERK1/2. The upregulation of DUSP1 was
blocked by the AT(1-7) receptor antagonist, indicating that
DUSP1 induction by Ang-(1-7) was a receptor-mediated process. Ang-(1-7) also reduced production of active TGF-β and
synthesis of fibronectin in the isolated tumoral fibroblasts.
This ability of Ang-(1-7) to prevent production of TGF-β1

as well as decrease TGF-β1–stimulated ERK1/2 activation
and fibronectin synthesis indicates that the heptapeptide is
an antagonist of TGF-β1–mediated fibrosis in breast cancer.
Of note, Ang-(1-7) also reduced the proliferation of breast tumor cell in vitro; the molecular mechanisms involved in the
inhibition of breast cancer cell proliferation are detailed in a
separate article.4
Collagen I deposition was significantly decreased by
Ang-(1-7) to reduce tumor fibrosis. However, the inhibition
of collagen synthesis by the heptapeptide may also participate in the reduction in breast tumor growth. Collagen I
forms a tissue scaffold to promote tumor growth and stimulates expression of genes associated with cellular metabolism, transcription, and translation, including eukaryotic
translation initiation factor 4B, glutamyl-prolyl-tRNA polymerase, and poly(A) polymerase, playing a role in both tumor structure as well as growth and progression (27).
Intratumoral collagen I modulates E-cadherin–mediated
cell-to-cell contact to increase tumor invasiveness and metastases (28). This suggests that the Ang-(1-7)–mediated decrease in collagen I production may also participate in the

reduction in tumor proliferation as well as the inhibition of
tumor metastases.
Fibronectin, another component of the ECM secreted by activated myofibroblasts, is involved in cell-matrix and cell-cell
adhesions, cell migration, and oncogenic transformation (29).
The deposition of fibronectin in breast tumor stroma is
positively correlated with tumor grade, size, and lymph node
invasion (30). Fibronectin stimulates tumor cells through
activation of integrin signaling to activate both focal adhesion
kinases and MAPKs, increasing cell proliferation, survival, and
angiogenesis (31). We observed a 40% decrease in fibronectin
in Ang-(1-7)–treated isolated tumoral fibroblasts, suggesting
that the heptapeptide may attenuate ECM deposition, tumor
invasion, and proliferation by reducing fibronectin.
TGF-β binds to its receptors on fibroblasts to activate
both MAPK and Smad signaling pathways and stimulate
cell proliferation and fibrosis. Activation of the Smad signaling pathway by TGF-β results in ECM synthesis and deposition, tenascin-C production, as well as its own production,
creating an autocrine cycle of fibroblast activation and ECM
deposition (5). TGF-β1 expression in breast cancer biopsies
positively correlated with the rate of disease progression,
independent of node status, tumor stage, age, and estrogen
receptor status, suggesting its role in tumor progression
(32). Because Ang-(1-7) reduced TGF-β1 in isolated tumoral

Figure 6. Effect of Ang-(1-7) on TGF-β, fibronectin, and DUSP1 in isolated tumor myofibroblasts and tumor sections. A, isolated tumoral fibroblasts
were serum starved overnight and incubated with 100 nmol/L Ang-(1-7) (A7) for 24 h. TGF-β was assessed by Western blot hybridization and quantified as a
function of β-actin. B, isolated tumoral fibroblasts were serum starved overnight and treated with 100 nmol/L Ang-(1-7) (A7) and 10 ng/mL TGF-β1 for
24 h. Fibronectin was assessed by Western blot hybridization and quantified as a function of β-actin (n = 3–4). *, P < 0.05. C, ZR-75-1 tumors from mice

fibroblasts, the heptapeptide may attenuate myofibroblast
activation by reducing TGF-β1 synthesis and signaling.
The exact molecular mechanism for the Ang-(1-7)–mediated
downregulation of TGF-β1 is not known. However, we previously showed that Ang-(1-7) increased cyclic AMP (cAMP) in
VSMCs; (33) because an increase in cAMP inhibited TGF-β–
stimulated collagen synthesis by ERK1/2 signaling in cardiac
fibroblasts (34), Ang-(1-7) may increase cAMP in tumoral fibroblasts to reduce TGF-β. In addition, the DUSP1 promoter
contains a cAMP-responsive element (35), suggesting that
Ang-(1-7) may increase cAMP in tumoral fibroblasts to upregulate DUSP1, reduce MAPK activities, and inhibit fibrosis.
The amount of interstitial fibrosis was 3-fold higher in ZR75-1 tumors than in BT-474 tumors, as assessed by picrosirius
red staining in saline-treated mice. Several factors could account for this difference. BT-474 cells express the c-Met

8326

receptor, whereas ZR-75-1 cells do not. Because activation
of the c-Met receptor by HGF reduces fibrosis (36, 37), HGF
signaling through the c-Met receptor may be responsible for
the decreased total interstitial fibrosis observed in the BT-474
tumors (38, 39). On the other hand, HER2 signaling increases
the expression of the Wilms' tumor suppressor gene (WT1)
product through activation of protein kinase B (Akt; ref. 40).
WT1 is implicated in tumor suppression and progression as
well as inhibition of TGF-β signaling, which may reduce interstitial fibrosis (41, 42). The overexpression of HER2 in BT-474
cells and increased WT1 signaling could also contribute to reduced interstitial fibrosis. Further investigation is warranted
to determine the molecular mechanism for the differences in
interstitial fibrosis in the ZR-75-1 and BT-474 tumors.
We observed a significant reduction in perivascular fibrosis in BT-474 tumors from Ang-(1-7)–medicated mice when

Ang-(1-7) Reduces Breast Tumor Fibrosis

compared with tumors from saline-treated mice. It was not
possible to quantify perivascular fibrosis in the ZR-75-1 tumors due to pervasive interstitial fibrosis. The heptapeptidemediated reduction in perivascular fibrosis in BT-474 tumors
may lead to an overall decrease in the tumoral interstitial fluid
pressure. High interstitial fluid pressure, found in breast tumors as well as in other types of tumors, is associated with
vessel leakiness, lymph vessel abnormalities, and perivascular
fibrosis, leading to matrix rigidity and fibroblast contractility
and resulting in increased fiber tension (43, 44). This results in
decreased transcapillary transport, limiting chemotherapeutic drug delivery to the tumor. These results suggest that
Ang-(1-7) may enhance the delivery of chemotherapeutic
agents when administered in combination with other therapeutic drugs (43).
The inhibition of tumor fibrosis by Ang-(1-7) is supported
by previous studies showing the antifibrotic effect of
Ang-(1-7) in cardiac and renal cells and tissues. Ang-(1-7)
infusion prevented cardiac fibrosis in deoxycorticosterone
acetate-salt–induced hypertension with a significant decrease in left ventricular wall fibrosis and reduced perivascular fibrosis (45), in agreement with studies showing that
the heptapeptide reduced collagen formation and TGF-β
in rat cardiac fibroblasts (46). Studies by our group showed
that Ang-(1-7) infusion reduced cardiac fibrosis in Ang II–
treated rats, further illustrating the role of Ang-(1-7) as an
antifibrotic agent (47). Mice with ablated mas, the Ang-(1-7)
receptor, have impaired cardiac function with increased cardiac collagen I, collagen III, and fibronectin deposition (48),
whereas mas deletion increased collagen III, collagen IV,
and fibronectin in the renal cortex and medulla (49). Our
results show that Ang-(1-7), through activation of mas, also
inhibits tumoral fibrosis.

In a recently reported phase I clinical trial assessing
Ang-(1-7) as a chemotherapeutic agent, we showed that
the heptapeptide reduced plasma placental growth factor
in patients with clinical benefit (50), in agreement with
our preclinical studies showing that Ang-(1-7) inhibits angiogenesis (16). Because activated myofibroblasts secrete cytokines that stimulate blood vessel formation (5), Ang-(1-7)
may reduce angiogenesis by inhibiting the growth of tumorassociated fibroblasts. Taken together, these results suggest
that Ang-(1-7) has pleiotropic effects on the tumor microenvironment to decrease tumor fibrosis, inhibit angiogenesis,
and reduce tumor growth.
