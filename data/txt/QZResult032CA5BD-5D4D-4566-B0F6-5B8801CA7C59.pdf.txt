ABSTRACT
The clinical course for both early and late stage Bladder Cancer (BC) continues
to be characterized by significant patient burden due to numerous occurrences and
recurrences requiring frequent surveillance strategies, intravesical drug therapies,
and even more aggressive treatments in patients with locally advanced or metastatic
disease. For these reasons, BC is also the most expensive cancer to treat. Fortunately,
BC offers an excellent platform for chemoprevention interventions with potential
to optimize the systemic and local exposure of promising agents to the bladder
mucosa. However, other than smoking cessation, there is a paucity of research that
systematically examines agents for chemoprevention of bladder cancers. Adopting
a systematic, molecular-mechanism based approach, the goal of this review is
to summarize epidemiological, in vitro, and preclinical studies, including data
regarding the safety, bioavailability, and efficacy of agents evaluated for bladder
cancer chemoprevention. Based on the available studies, phytochemicals, specifically
isothiocyanates such as sulforaphane, present in Brassicaceae or “cruciferous”
vegetables in the precursor form of glucoraphanin are: (a) available in standardized
formulations; (b) bioavailable- both systemically and in the bladder; (c) observed
to be potent inhibitors of BC carcinogenesis through multiple mechanisms; and (d)
without toxicities at these doses. Based on available evidence from epidemiological, in
vitro, preclinical, and early phase trials, phytochemicals, specifically isothiocyanates
(ITCs) such as sulforaphane (SFN) represent a promising potential chemopreventitive
agent in bladder cancer.

INTRODUCTION

occupational exposure to amines, 4-aminobiphenyl &
anilines (10% of all cases), as well as phenacetin derived
analgesics (oral pain medications) [5, 6] have also been
known to contribute to the etiology of BC. BC originates
primarily in the transitional cell epithelium (urothelial
epithelium) that lines the inner surface of the bladder
and is directly exposed to urine, which is also known as
transitional cell carcinoma (TCC) [4]. Approximately 7075% of newly diagnosed BCs are non-muscle invasive

Bladder cancer (BC) is the fourth most common
cancer in men in the United States and eighth most
common cause of cancer death [1]. In 2016, an estimated
76,000 men and women will be diagnosed with BC in
the US and 16,000 people will die of BC [2]. Cigarette
smoking (mainly exposure to aromatic amines) accounts
for 50% of bladder cancers [3, 4]. Non-tobacco related

(NMIBC), previously referred to as “superficial” BC,
while 25-30% of tumors upon initial diagnosis are muscle
invasive (≥ clinical stage T2) [4]. NMIBC is typically
treated with endoscopic transurethral resection (TUR),
which may be followed by an intravesical therapy,
depending on the extent of the cancer, tumor grade and
the presence of carcinoma in situ. Given the high risk of
recurrence and disease progression, careful surveillance
after cancer removal by TUR via cystoscopy is currently
the standard clinical practice. Intravesical therapies with
Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) or chemotherapeutic
agents (e.g., mitomycin C), delivered via a urethral
catheter, are used to prevent or delay recurrence and
progression after TUR [7]. Although BCG has been more
effective than other agents, 20-40% of patients fail to
respond [8]. Recurrence is common despite BCG treatment
with recurrence rates for high risk T1 tumors ranging from
16 to 40% and progression rates of 4% to 40%. [9-14].
Upon diagnosis of muscle invasive bladder cancer (stage
T2), the current definitive treatment is radical cystectomy
(surgical extirpation of the bladder) and urinary diversion.
Overall survival is poor once distant metastasis (~15% 5
year survival) has occurred [15] with stage being the most
important prognostic factor of BC [16].
The clinical course for both early and late stage
BC continues to be characterized by significant patient
burden due to numerous occurrences and recurrences
requiring frequent surveillance strategies, intravesical drug
therapies, and even more aggressive treatments in patients
with locally advanced or metastatic disease Additionally,
BC is the most expensive overall cancer to treat given its
propensity to recur and the need for frequent treatment
and surveillance [17, 18]. BC thus carries a significant
patient burden as well as a healthcare cost-related burden
underscoring the need to optimize BC care and need for
prevention strategies especially targeting non-muscle
invasive patients [17, 18]. Evaluation of chemoprevention
interventions in BC patients is especially feasible given
physiological exposure of bladder urothelial cells to
excreted compounds, readily available pathological
specimens for analysis, and measurable intermediate
endpoint biomarkers [17, 19]. However, other than
smoking cessation, there is a paucity of research that
systematically examines agents for the chemoprevention
of BC [20]. Smoking cessation has been shown to decrease
recurrence and improve prognosis, yet this beneficial
effect is only observed for long term smoking cessation (
> 10 years) [17, 19].
The objective is to review the available evidence
from epidemiological, in vitro, pre-clinical animal and
early clinical trials of various agents evaluated for bladder
cancer chemoprevention with a focus on sulforaphane for
bladder cancer chemoprevention.

Vitamins
Previous studies have focused on vitamin intake
including, vitamin C, vitamin B6 and vitamin E and
an essential trace element, selenium. However, the
majority of these studies failed to indicate a promising
agent for primary or secondary chemoprevention of
BC [21]. Retinoids (vitamin A derivatives) and alpha
tocopherol (vitamin E) have been studied as a putative
chemopreventive agent in bladder cancer. In vitro studies
suggested that rats with vitamin A deficiency were more
likely to develop environmentally induced bladder cancer,
and that supplementation of vitamin A could prevent
bladder cancer development [22-25]. However, clinical
studies do not support a chemopreventive role of retinoids,
including the ATBC study that targeted at-risk smokers and
assigned patients to beta-carotene, alpha tocopherol, both
or placebo and showed no benefit in prevention of bladder
cancer at 6 years of follow up [26]. A secondary analysis
of the SELECT trial also failed to show a protective
effect for vitamin E or selenium for bladder cancer [27].
Other studies exploring the role of retinoids for secondary
chemoprevention also showed no benefit, and as a result
of concerns for toxicity (increased myocardial infarction
risk) and lack of clear benefit, one study was terminated
prior to accrual [28-30].
Pyridoxine (B6) has been investigated in two
randomized trials for secondary chemoprevention
without evidence of a benefit [31, 32]. Ascorbic acid
(vitamin C) has not been studied in randomized trials, and
epidemiological data is not convincing with respect to its
protective effect [33]. Mega dose multivitamins have not
demonstrated clinical effectiveness in chemoprevention
despite epidemiological research and clinical research
suggesting a possible role for chemoprevention [34].

NSAIDS and Cox-2 inhibitors
More recent chemopreventive efforts have exposed
the role of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs,
specifically the role of selective COX-2 inhibitors. This
has included clinical studies with celecoxib that suggested
a correlation between COX-2 expression and prognosis.
One trial in nonmuscle invasive bladder cancer patients
showed similar risk in progression and recurrence between
celecoxib and placebo [35]. The results of an expanded

cancer patients who responded to BCG treated with
celecoxib or placebo are still not available. Intriguingly,
an in vitro study using allyl isothiocyanate (AITC) with
celecoxib produced depletion of prostaglandin E2, a
key downstream signaling molecule of Cox-2, caspase
activation and down regulation of vascular endothelial
growth factor in the tumor tissues. These data show
that AITC and celecoxib may complement each other
in inhibiting bladder carcinogenesis, providing a novel
combination approach for future validation in preclinical
models for chemoprevention of bladder cancer [36].

invasive BC patients taking metformin to placebo showed
no difference in recurrence and no statistical difference
in time to recurrence [43]. Also, in vitro research using
Rhodiola rosea extract has shown to inhibit mTOR and
decrease growth of bladder cancer [42]. Finally, some
research has demonstrated a possible role of estrogen
receptor blockade using tamoxifen in mouse model in
modulating bladder tumorigenesis [44].

EGFR inhibitors and mTOR inhibitors

Isoflavones, which are soy derivatives, have recently
been investigated as a possible chemoprevention agent
based on epidemiological and in vitro evidence. A recent
trial by Messing et al., explored the use of genistein, an
isoflavone, in pre-surgical bladder cancer patients and
demonstrated significant inhibition of p-EGFR at dosespecific levels, but other apoptotic and proliferative
biomarkers were not impacted [45]. There has been an
increase in newer research that has focused on isolation
of (natural) bioactive compounds. Recently, Justicidin
A, a methanol extract of Justicia procumbens, has been
investigated in vitro as an anti-angiogenic and apoptosisinducing agent [46], as have pomegranate extracts [47].
Additionally, green tea catechins have been demonstrated
in several in vitro and in vivo studies to have significant
anti-carcinogenic potential [48-51]. However, these are
early observations that have to be further validated in
preclinical models prior to evaluation in clinical trials.
Despite attempts at identifying other single and
combination agents for chemoprevention, several
epidemiological, in vitro, preclinical, and early
phase trials have shown that the phytochemicals,

Soy isoflavones

Also, research is being conducted with erlotinib,
highly selective, reversible inhibitor of epidermal growth
factor receptor (HER1/EGFR) tyrosine kinase which
is overexpressed in more than 75% of bladder cancers
[37]. One phase 2 clinical trial involved neoadjuvant
administration of erlotinib in patients before undergoing
radical cystectomy with a complete response rate in twenty
five percent of patients. There was substantial skin toxicity
noted especially in patients who experienced complete
response [38]. A phase IIa randomized multi-institutional
trial (NCT02169284) is ongoing investigating role of
erlotinib in presurgical (RC or TURBT) patients [39] .
Additionally, research has focused on mTOR
inhibition as a potential target for chemoprevention in
bladder cancer [40]. Metformin, a commonly utilized
diabetes medication has properties as an mTOR
inhibitor and has been investigated with underwhelming
results mostly in a retrospective fashion [41, 42]. One

isothiocyanates (ITCs), specifically sulforaphane (SFN)
present in Brassicaceae or “cruciferous” vegetables in
the precursor form of glucoraphanin [52-54], are: (a)
available in standardized formulations; (b) bioavailable both systemically and in the bladder; (c) observed to be
potent inhibitors of BC carcinogenesis through multiple
mechanisms [2]; and (d) associated with no dose-limiting

have very high concentrations of SFN after gastric lavage,
second in visceral organ concentration only to stomach
tissue [64]. Uptake of SFN into bladder cancer cells is
dependent upon diffusion and rapidly conjugate with
GSH and other intracellular proteins [65]. Several factors
including concentration, lipophilicity, and exposure time
influence uptake [65-67].
Preclinical studies using animal models have
demonstrated bioavailability of SFN with metabolites
distributed to all tissues, including the bladder, suggesting
the potential for systemic benefits [68-70]. Administration
of a freeze-dried aqueous extract of broccoli sprouts
to rats significantly and dose-dependently inhibited
bladder cancer development induced by N-butyl-N(4-hydroxybutyl) nitrosamine [71]. The incidence,
multiplicity, size, and progression of BC were all
inhibited by the extract, while the extract itself caused no
histologic changes in the bladder. Moreover, inhibition
of bladder carcinogenesis by the extract was associated
with significant induction of phase-II enzymes such
as glutathione S-transferase and NAD(P)H:quinone
oxidoreductase 1 in the bladder. Over 70% of the
isothiocyanates present in the extract were excreted in
the urine as isothiocyanate equivalents (isothiocyanates
+ dithiocarbamates) within 12 h after a single oral dose,
indicating high bioavailability and rapid urinary excretion.
Urinary concentrations in extract-treated rats were 2
to 3 orders of magnitude higher than those in plasma,
indicating that the bladder epithelium, the major site of
bladder cancer development, is most exposed to orallydosed isothiocyanate. In a murine UMUC3 xenograft
model, semi-purified diets containing 4% broccoli sprouts,
or 2% broccoli sprout isothiocyanate extract, or gavaged
pure SFN, or erucin (each at 295 μmol/kg, similar to
dietary exposure) produced tumor weight reduction of
42% (p = 0.02), 42% (p = 0.04), 33% (p = 0.04), and 58%
(p < 0.0001), respectively. SFN and erucin metabolites are
present in mouse plasma (micromolar range) and tumor
tissue, with N-acetylcysteine conjugates as the most
abundant [68].
Several clinical trials have been conducted to
evaluate the effectiveness of SFN for chemoprevention,
most of which have investigated bioavailability in
healthy, disease-free subjects [72-75,125]. The method of
ingestion in these clinical trials has varied from pure SFN,
broccoli soups/pill forms, and broccoli as a food item.
Glucoraphanin (GRR) in broccoli is converted to SFN
either by plant myrosinases, or if the plant myrosinases
have been denatured by cooking, by bacterial myrosinases
in the human colon. SFN is passively absorbed and rapidly
conjugated with glutathione by glutathione S-transferases
(GSTs), then metabolized sequentially by γ-glutamyltranspeptidase (GTP), cysteinyl-glycinease (GCase) and
N-acetyltransferase (NAT). The conjugates are actively
transported into the systemic circulation where the
mercapturic acid and its precursors are urinary excretion

Sulforaphane for bladder cancer chemoprevention
Sulforaphane (SFN), (-)-1-isothiocyanato-(4R)(methylsulfinyl) butane [CH3-SO-(CH2)4-NCS], is an
isothiocyanate found in high concentrations in broccoli
sprouts. Sulforaphane was first isolated and shown to be
a potent anti-carcinogenic agent in 1992 by Zhang, et al.
[54].

Epidemiological evidence for sulforaphane for
bladder cancer chemoprevention
Epidemiological studies have shown a potential role
for increased fluid intake and consumption of cruciferous
vegetables, particularly for broccoli consumption, in
reducing the risk of BC [55-57]. In a large prospective
study, 39% reduction in BC risk was observed with an
intake of 2 servings or more of broccoli compared to <
1 serving per week (p = 0.0009) [55]. In a meta-analysis
of ten clinical trials, cruciferous vegetable intake was
associated with decreased risk of bladder cancer overall
[58].

Pharmacokinetics of sulforaphane
Given the epidemiological studies which suggested
a potential role for SFN as a chemoprevention agent, many
studies have been conducted to elicit the pharmacokinetics
of SFN. Broccoli accumulates significant amounts of
the phytonutrient glucoraphanin (4-methylsulfinylbutyl
glucosinolates), which is metabolized in vivo to the
biologically active sulforaphane. This conversion requires
myrosinase, which is present in the plant as well as in
the gastrointestinal tract [53]. Upon being consumed,
SFN is metabolized via the mercapturic acid pathway to
form cysteinylglycine-, cysteine-, and N-acetylcysteine
(NAC) conjugates. These metabolites are then excreted
via the urine [59, 60]. Studies have shown that 70% of an
initial SFN dose was able to be retrieved in urine [61, 62].
Urine has been shown in rat models to have significant
concentration of SFN present as NAC conjugates with
72% to 95% of the original SFN dose recovered in urine
[63] Also, bladder tissue in a rat model has been shown to

products. Deconjugation may also occur to yield the parent
isothiocyanate, SFN. The mercapturic acid and cysteine
conjugate forms are the major urinary metabolites of
SFN [76]. In interventions with glucosinolate-containing
Brussels sprouts for 1-3 weeks, increased GST enzyme
activity with increased GST-alpha induction was observed
in plasma and tissues including liver, bladder, and small
intestine [72, 77]. Bioavailability, as measured by urinary
excretion of SFN and its metabolites (in approximately
12-hour collections after dosing), was substantially
greater with the SFN-rich (mean = 70%) than with GRRrich (mean = 5%) beverages. Inter-individual variability
in excretion was considerably lower with SFR than with
GRR beverage [62]. These studies have also corroborated
the critical role of myrosinase in metabolizing SFN,
as patients taking food sources vs. extract of SFN
without myrosinase had a fourfold increase in urinary
concentration [76].

stress response system regulated through the transcription
factor Nrf2 (nuclear factor (erythroid-derived2)-like
2). Keap1 is a sulfhydryl-rich protein that represses
Nrf2 signaling by facilitating the polyubiquitination
of Nrf2, thereby enabling its subsequent proteasomal
degradation. Interaction of SFN with Keap1 disrupts this
function and allows for nuclear accumulation of Nrf2
and activation of its transcriptional program (Figure 1).
Enhanced transcription of Nrf2 target genes provokes a
strong cytoprotective response that enhances resistance to
carcinogenesis and other diseases mediated by exposures
to electrophiles and oxidants [78, 79,109]. Inhibition of
Phase I enzymes by SFN may contribute to inhibition of
procarcinogens and its chemopreventitive effect. The Nrf2
transcription factor is essential for induction of phase 2
proteins [78, 79, 109]. In in vitro and in vivo using murine
models in oral carcinogenesis, SFN was demonstrated to
activate the NRF2 pathway and downregulate oxidative
damage [110-11]. SFN has also been observed to be a
potent inducer of phase 2 detoxification enzymes [e.g.,
glutathione transferases, epoxide hydrolase, NAD(P)
H: quinone reductase, and glucuronosyltransferases],
which may offer protection against carcinogenesis,
mutagenesis, and other forms of toxicity elicited by
electrophiles and reactive forms of oxygen [69, 79-82]

Pharmacodynamics/ mechanisms of action of
sulforaphane
Although several molecular targets in cellular and
animal models have been identified, the most sensitive
target for SFN is Keap1, a key sensor for the adaptive

. SFN promotes reactive oxygen species formation by
inhibition of Complex III within mitochondria [112] .
Evidence suggests that SFN activation of production
of 4-hydroxynonenal (a lipid peroxidation product)
may be essential in the chemopreventitive mechanism.
4-hydroxynonenal induces proteins critical to apoptosis,
promotes cell cycle arrest, and also activates Nrf2 pathway
[113]. Other mechanisms include down regulation of
NFkB, resulting in induction of cell cycle arrest and
apoptosis [83], while selectively targeting abnormal/
malignant cells [70] compared to normal BC cells [2,
36] . Using bladder cancer cell lines, Abbaoui, et al. [68]
demonstrated that downregulation of survivin, epidermal
growth factor receptor (EGFR), and human epidermal
growth factor receptor 2 (HER2/neu) induced G2/M cell
cycle accumulation and apoptosis [68]. In osteosarcoma
cell lines, SFN decreased cell invasion and also focal
adhesion kinase (FAK), both of which are important in
cancer progression [114]. SFN has been shown to inhibit
inflammatory responses, including downregulation of
cyclooxygenase-2 (Cox-2) and reduction of prostaglandin
E2 levels [84, 85]. SFN likely effects immune and
inflammatory response specifically via Toll-like receptor
(TLR4) suppression via blockade of thiol-mediated
conjugation in macrophages [86]. Telomere length which
is essential for cell survival may be decreased by exposure
to SFN [115].
Other studies suggest a key mechanism involving
SFN is disruption of mitochondria. SFN has been
shown to promote translocation of Bak, leading to loss
of transmembrane potential, mitochondrial degradation,
and release of cytochrome C [78, 87]. Studies using
bladder cancer cell lines suggest an M phase arrest as
the primary mechanism for SFN [88]. In cervical cancer
cell lines, SFN was shown to cause G2/M arrest via
cyclinB1 downregulation [116]. Therefore, SFN acts
upon a multitude of growth-regulatory and inflammatory
pathways, some of which contain oncogenic targets, to
exert its potent anti-cancer effects.

of SFN with acetazolamide in bladder cancer in vitro cell
lines and xenografts. The authors showed diminished
Ki-67, PHH3, and cyclin D1 and increases in cell cycle
inhibitors p21 and p27 as well as decreases in Akt
kinase activity [117]. Additionally, the studies noted
downregulation of key metastatic proteins such as
E-cadherin, N-cadherin, and vimentin.

Animal models
Other preclinical trials have demonstrated positive
results using murine models with SFN for breast [100],
skin [101], prostate [92] , oral [110], and pancreatic [70]
cancers. Three studies have been conduct in mice and rats
investigating the effect of SFN using a BC model. Abbaoui
et al, using a mouse xenograft model showed G2/M phase
arrest in models treated SFN [68]. Wang et al using
the same murine xenograft documented tumor growth
inhibition by 63% as well as a reduction in angiogenesis
and an increase in immunological cellular response [103].
Using a rat orthotopic model, Munday et al demonstrated
reduced incidence of BC by 61% and a decrease in tumor
size with a delay in time to tumor progression [71].
Animal studies have suggested potential toxicity
of isothiocyanates, including bladder hyperplasia [104].
However, this effect was likely secondary to overdosing.
In fact, SFN have never been implicated as toxic to the
bladder even in animal models using doses significantly
higher than those used in clinical trials.

Clinical trials in other cancer models
To date, data from early clinical trials with SFN
have focused on prostate cancer chemoprevention [73,
105, 123] with the exception of a single trial in women
with abnormal mammograms, using a pre-biopsy window
of opportunity for intervention with SFN [120]. The doses
and formulations of SFN and duration of intervention,
target populations and biomarkers/endpoints selected in
these trials vary significantly. In one study, 60 mg (340
μmol) “stabilized SFN” (Prostaphane®) vs. placebo [73]
was used targeting men with biochemical recurrence of
prostate cancer. A reduction in serum PSA was observed
in 8/20 (40%) of prostate cancer patients with no clinical
toxicities, compared to placebo [105].
Targeting a similar population with 200 μmol daily
for 5 months , Alumkal et al [105]demonstrated that 1 of
20 patients had a 50% decline in serum PSA at 5 months.
Using 400 g broccoli/week vs. 400 g peas/week
targeting men with high-grade prostate intraepithelial
neoplasia) (HGPIN), Traka et al [123] showed significant
changes in TGFβ, Insulin signaling and EGF receptor
pathways.
A recent double blinded randomized trial in
women scheduled for breast cancer patients compared

In vitro models in bladder cancer
In vitro studies in BC [2, 89, 90], lung [91, 121],
prostate [92, 93], colorectal, thyroid [124], renal [113],
ovarian [118] and leukemia cells lines [94, 95] have
shown SFN to be a potent inhibitor of carcinogenesis
through several molecular mechanisms [79], including
in BC as discussed below. SFN inhibits the survival
and proliferation of a wide array of animal and human
BC cell lines [2, 96-98]. Also, SFN has been shown to
be selectively more toxic to malignant urothelial cells
(human) than normal urothelium [68]. Using BIU87
bladder cell lines Dang et al demonstrated that SFN
downregulated NF-KB levels and upregulated Insulinlike growth factor-binding protein-3 (IGFBP-3) resulting
in more apoptosis [99]. Islam et al, studied combination

difference in several relevant biomarkers including Ki67 and HDAC3 [120]. To our knowledge, there are no

chemoprevention.

effectiveness as well as the biological effects of these early
trials should include bladder tumor cells as well as the
normal appearing urothelium adjacent to bladder neoplasia
since these data may inform strategies for preventing
the field cancerization effect seen in progressive, high
grade superficial bladder cancer. Thus, by using a well
rationalized, systematic approach, rigorous experimental
design that addresses challenges and limitations are
critical to evaluating agents for cancer chemoprevention
in early phase trials, prior to advancing to phase III trial.
To date, data from early clinical trials with SFN
have focused on prostate cancer chemoprevention
[73,105,123] with the exception of a single trial in
women with abnormal mammograms, using a prebiopsy window of opportunity for intervention with SFN
[120]. The doses and formulations of SFN and duration
of intervention, target populations and biomarkers/
endpoints selected in these trials vary significantly. Other
than smoking cessation, there is a paucity of research
that systematically examines specific agents relevant for
chemoprevention of bladder cancers. Despite extensive
knowledge of potential targets of SFN (Nrf2 induction
and downregulation of NF-kB), and resulting modulation
of intermediate endpoint biomarkers (apoptosis and
proliferation) relevant to bladder carcinogenesis, these
agents have not been evaluated in clinical trials for
bladder cancer chemoprevention. Future clinical trials
should be informed from the promising pharmacokinetics
and pharmacodynamics evidence that exists from current
in vitro and preclinical studies to inform design of early
phase chemoprevention trials target men and women with
non-muscle invasive as well as invasive bladder cancers.
The clinical course for both early and late stage
BC continues to be characterized by significant patient
burden due to numerous occurrences and recurrences
requiring frequent surveillance strategies, intravesical
drug therapies, and even more aggressive treatments
in patients with locally advanced or metastatic disease.
Based on available evidence from epidemiological, in
vitro, preclinical, and early phase trials, phytochemicals,
specifically isothiocyanates (ITCs) such as sulforaphane
(SFN) represent a promising potential chemopreventative
agent in bladder cancer. These studies will ultimately
inform development of chemoprevention interventions in
both early (non-muscle invasive) and late invasive stage
BC patients.

DISCUSSION
There are some limitations that are inherent to using
agents that target multiple mechanistic pathways that
contribute chemoprevention effects. A pragmatic future
direction to chemoprevention is to utilize a broad spectrum
approach [106] that involves using bioactive formulations
of botanicals (as single agents or in combination with
other botanicals or biologics) that have been shown to
produce robust targeting of relevant and multiple, but
well characterized molecular pathways, without clinically
limiting toxicity - an approach that may be more effective
than agents evaluated to date. SFN, similar to other
botanicals, target multiple signal transduction pathways
that make it challenging to determine exactly the interplay
of these mechanisms in chemoprevention. Future studies
should continue to examine specifc mechanisms as well as
the interplay of these mechanisms involved in modulating
bladder carcinogenesis. Further characterization of the
chemopreventive properties of sulforaphane is critical
to our understanding these mechanisms that may
identify targeted pathways of sulforaphane in bladder
carcinogenesis. In addition, these findings may identify
and inform selection of biomarkers in evaluating efficacy
of sulforaphane in modulating bladder carcinogenesis.
Additionally, bladder cancer represents a very
genetically heterogeneous cancer with more than
fifteen oncogenes identified and more than 20 tumor
suppressor genes with varying frequencies [107], As such,
chemopreventive agents that are effective in some types
of bladder cancers, may not be as effective in others. It
is also recognized that these agents may have specific
effects at different stages of tumor progression. This
certainly seems to be true of NRF2 activation in many
types of cancer including lung cancer, where advanced
disease is actually associated with the accumulation of
genetic alterations in KEAP1 and NF2EL2 that promote
constitutive activation. (TCGA also identified similar
NF2EL2 mutations in muscle-invasive bladder cancers)
[121]. Thus, data obtained from any agent, including
SFN, which is evaluated for a specific stage of tumor,
may not be generalizable for all stages of tumor [108].
Future studies should include early phase trials including
heterogenous patient populations, including non-muscle
invasive and muscle-invasive BC patients, potentially
block randomized to examine effectiveness in various
stages of bladder tumorogenesis, Additionally, the
