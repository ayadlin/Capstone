ABSTRACT
The membrane-anchored glycoprotein RECK negatively regulates multiple
metalloproteinases and is frequently downregulated in tumors. Forced RECK
expression in cancer cells results in suppression of tumor angiogenesis, invasion,
and metastasis in xenograft models. A previous methylome study on breast cancer
tissues detected inverse correlation between RECK CpG methylation (in an intron-1
region) and relapse-free survival. In this study, we focused on another region of
the RECK CpG island (a promoter/exon-1 region) and found an inverse correlation
between its methylation and RECK-inducibility by an HDAC inhibitor, MS275, among
a panel of breast cancer cell lines (n=15). In clinical samples (n=62), RECK intron-1
methylation was prevalent among luminal breast cancers as reported previously (26
of 38 cases; 68%) and particularly enriched in tumors of the ER+PR- subclass (10 of
10 cases) and of higher histological grades (Grade 2 and 3; 28 of 43 cases; P=0.006).
In about a half of these cases, promoter/exon-1 methylation was absent, and hence,
RECK may be inducible by certain drugs such as MS275. Our results indicate the value
of combined use of two RECK methylation markers for predicting prognosis and drugsensitivity of breast cancers.

(ER), progesterone receptor (PR), and epidermal growth
factor receptor 2 (HER2). A large fraction (70–75%) of
IDCs are positive for ER and classified as luminal cancers.
A small fraction of luminal cancers are positive for HER2
and called luminal HER2. PR expression usually follows
the ER expression but can be low in some cases where
prognoses tend to be poorer. Two major subtypes, besides
luminal cancers, are HER2-enriched and triple-negative
(ER-/PR-/HER2-) [2]. HER2-enriched cancers show
amplification and high expression of the ERBB2 gene
and several other genes of the ERBB2 amplicon. Breast
cancer classification based on gene expression profiles

INTRODUCTION
Breast cancer, a major health concern worldwide [1],
exhibits disparate clinical behaviors and patient outcomes
[2]. Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) is a non-invasive
breast lesion that accounts for 10-25% of all breast
neoplasms; DCIS is not life-threatening but a risk factor
for, and potential precursor of, invasive cancers. The most
common histological type of breast cancers, accounting
for ~80% of the cases, is invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC).
IDC has been subgrouped based on immunohistochemical
detection of several markers such as estrogen receptor

has also been proposed [3]. Such molecular classifications
of cancers are of great clinical importance, since they
may provide molecular bases for predicting the tumors’
prognoses and/or responses to therapy [2].
Altered patterns of DNA methylation are found
in cancer cells, and their values as potential biomarkers
for diagnoses and prognoses have been explored [4].
For example, attempts to correlate genome-wide DNA
methylation patterns in breast cancers and their prognoses
have been made [5–7]. Since epigenetic silencing of tumor
suppressor genes is involved in carcinogenesis, inhibitors of
certain epigenetic regulators, such as DNA methyl transferases
(DNMTs) and histone deacetylases (HDACs), have been
tested in cancer therapy with promising results [8–10]. In
fact, two DNMT inhibitors, 5-azacytidine and 5-aza-2′deoxycytidine (decitabine), have already been approved by
FDA for treatment of myelodysplastic syndrome [11, 12].
RECK, initially isolated as a transformation
suppressor gene by cDNA-expression cloning, encodes a
GPI-anchored glycoprotein with activities to downregulate
or inhibit multiple metalloproteinases [13, 14]. Reduced
RECK expression is found in various types of tumors,
and the levels of residual RECK expression in tumors
tend to correlate with better prognoses [15, 16]. In genefocused studies, extensive methylation of RECK CpG

island has been found in cancers of the colon, stomach,
liver, and lung, and its correlation with poorer prognoses
detected [17–22]. Importantly, in a non-biased, genomewide methylation study, Hill and colleagues detected
RECK as one of several loci whose methylation inversely
correlated with relapse-free survival among breast cancer
patients [5]. They employed an assay called Combined
Bisulfite Restriction Analysis (COBRA) [23] for rapid
detection of CpG methylation; in the case of RECK, they
used a set of PCR primers amplifying an intron-1 region
of its CpG island (see Figure 1A, bottom line). We refer
to the methylation of this region “RIM” (RECK Intron-1
Methylation) in this paper to distinguish it from a newly
examined region (see below).
Involvement of DNMT3B in oncogene-induced
RECK gene silencing [24] and induction of RECK
expression by DNMT inhibitors [17, 20, 21, 24–26] have
been reported. RECK activation by an HDAC inhibitor,
trichostatin A (TSA), has also been observed in several
systems [27–32], suggesting the involvement of histone
modifications. Besides these epigenetic regulations,
multiple other mechanisms of RECK downregulation,
such as signaling triggered by growth factors, cell density,
oncoproteins, hypoxia, and post-transcriptional inhibition
by microRNAs, have also been reported [29, 30, 32–34].

In the present study, we designed a new set of
primers amplifying a region of RECK CpG island
containing the proximal promoter and exon-1 (see Figure
3A, bottom line); we refer to the methylation of this
region “RPM” (RECK Promoter/exon-1 Methylation). Our
data indicate the utility of RIM and RPM as distinctive
molecular markers useful for sub-grouping luminal
breast cancers and their potential values in predicting the
prognoses and drug-sensitivity of breast cancers.

treatment (Figure 2A–2C, compare lane 4 to lane 2)
indicate successful DNA demethylation. MS275, on the
other hand, exhibited little effects on RIM (Figure 2A–
2C, compare lane 6 to lane 2). In these cell lines, 5-azadC
alone (namely, demethylation alone) showed little effect
on RECK expression (Figure 2D–2F, bar/lane 2). In two
RIM-positive cell lines, T-47D and ZR-75-1, combination
of two inhibitors (5-azadC and MS275) was effective in
activating RECK expression (Figure 2E, 2F, bar/lane 4)
while MS275 alone was not so effective (Figure 2E, 2F,
bar/lane 3). In a RIM-negative cell line, MDA-MB-231,
MS275 alone was sufficient to induce robust RECK
expression (Figure 2G), supporting the idea that RIM
may be useful in predicting whether or not demethylation
is prerequisite for MS275-induced RECK expression.
The response of RECK in the RIM-positive MCF7
cells, however, did not support this idea; MS275 could
upregulate RECK mRNA to some extent but 5-azadC
failed to enhance this effect in MCF7 (Figure 2D, bar/
lane 3, 4). Survey of additional cell lines yielded another
example of RIM-positive cell line, HCC1954, in which
RECK could be upregulated by MS275 alone (Figure 2H)
although the methylation seems to be incomplete in this
case (Figure 1B, lane 18).

RESULTS
RECK CpG methylation in breast cancer cell lines
Focusing on the intro-1 region of the RECK CpG
island, Hill and colleagues found a significant inverse
correlation between its methylation (RIM) in tumor
tissues and relapse-free survival of the patients [5]. Their
data also suggested the prevalence of RIM in the tumors
positive for ER (P=0.013) and those at relatively early
stages (P=0.022) (Supplementary Table S2).
To confirm and extend these important findings, we
applied the same COBRA protocols to analyze RIM in 16
cell lines, one derived from normal mammary epithelium
(MCF-10A) and 15 from breast cancers of various
subtypes (Figure 1B; Supplementary Figure S1). RIM
was detected in 8 of 15 cancer-derived cell lines (53%)
but not in MCF-10A (Table 1). The COBRA results were
confirmed by sequencing individual PCR products cloned
into a bacterial plasmid (Figure 1C and data not shown).
The pattern of RIM distribution among breast cancer
subtypes is largely recapitulated in this small set of cell
lines: significant enrichment of RIM in luminal cancers
(5 of 5) and its paucity in triple negative cancers were
detected (1 of 7; Table 1A, 1B, “RIM” column). RECK
expression (both mRNA and protein) is low in cell lines
positive for RIM (Figure 1D), suggesting the involvement
of RIM in RECK silencing. These data also suggest the
value of these cell lines in studying how RIM affects
RECK expression and the properties of breast cancer cells.

RECK promoter/exon-1 methylation (RPM)
in breast cancer cell lines
Why MS275 could upregulate RECK expression
in some RIM-positive cells but not others? To test the
possibility that we were focusing on an area inappropriate
for predicting cell’s response to MS275, we designed a new
set of COBRA primers to monitor methylation of more
upstream region of RECK CpG island (RPM; Figure 3A,
bottom line). Among the 15 breast cancer cell lines, three
(T-47D, ZR-75-1, MDA-MB-453) were positive for
RPM (Figure 3B; Table 1); the results were confirmed by
clone-sequencing (Figure 3C). As expected, RPM could
be reduced by 5-azadC in these cell lines (Figure 3D–3F,
compare lane 4 to lane 2) but not by MS275 (Figure 3D–3F,
compare lane 6 to lane 2).
Importantly, the extent of RPM at the sequence level
(Figure 3C) differs dramatically between MCF7 (1.1%) and
two other luminal cell lines, T-47D (55 %) and ZR-75-1
(90%). The other MS275-responsive cell line HCC1954
(Figure 2H) was also RPM-negative (Figure 3B, lane 20).
Thus, RPM better predicts the cells’ response to MS275
than RIM. In this small set of cell lines, however, no
significant association of RPM to certain tumor subtype
could be detected (Table 1B, “RPM” column).

Effects of DNMT inhibitor and HDAC inhibitor
on RECK expression
To test the effects of CpG methylation on RECK
expression, we treated some of these cell lines with a
DNMT inhibitor, 5-aza-2′-deoxycytidine (5-azadC), and
determined the levels of RECK mRNA and protein. We
also examined the effects of an HDAC inhibitor, MS275,
which we found to induce RECK expression in some other
cell lines, such as those derived from human fibrosarcoma
(Yoshida et al., unpublished). First, we confirmed the
effects of 5-azadC to reduce RIM in three luminal cell
lines (MCF7, T-47D, ZR-75-1) by COBRA; the increased
intensity of full-length band and decreased intensity of
smaller bands in BstU1-digested samples after 5-azadCwww.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

To better understand the biological and clinical
significance of above findings in cell lines, we

RECK mRNA was lower in the RIM+ group than the
RIM- group, although the difference was not statistically
significant (P=0.055; Figure 4C, bar 3, 4). RECK mRNA
was relatively abundant in luminal tumors (Supplementary
Figure S6A), and within this subtype, significant
correlation between RIM and lower RECK expression was
detected (P=0.041; Figure 4C, bar 5). Third, as we found
in cell lines (Table 1B, 1A), frequency of RIM among
tumor samples (33 of 62 cases; 53%) was higher than that
of RPM (16 of 62; 26%), and majority of RPM+ tumors
(15 of 16; 94%) were also RIM+ (Figure 4D). Fourth, both

findings of potential importance were noted. First,
comparison between matched pairs of normal and tumor

RECK mRNA (P=0.001; Figure 4A) and prevalence of
RECK CpG methylation, both RPM and RIM, in tumor
tissues (Figure 4B, bar 2, 4). Second, when 62 tumor
samples were divided into two groups based on RECK
methylation status (RPM or RIM), the average level of

RPM and RIM were prevalent in luminal/ER+ tumors
(Figure 4E; Table 2). Fifth, RECK CpG methylation (both
RPM and RIM) was negative, althogh RECK mRNA was
minimal, in DCIS (n=6; Table 2 ; Supplementary Figure
S6A). Sixth, all the ER+PR- tumors were positive for RIM
(10 of 10; Table 2). Seventh, RECK CpG methylation,
especially RIM, correlates with higher tumor stages and
histological grades (Table 2), supporting the idea that the
RECK silencing (associated with RIM) contributes to the
malignant behaviors of breast cancer cells.

cells (RPM+) (Supplementary Figure S7C, lanes 5,
6). Second, association of HDAC1, a known target
of MS275, to the RECK promoter was confirmed by
ChIP assay (Supplementary Figure S7E, S7F). Relative
intensity of 3 ChIP bands differed between cell lines: P1
was most intense in T-47D while E1 was most intense in
MDA-MB-231, although biological significance of this
difference is unclear. Third, knockdown of HDAC1 using
two siRNAs (#1, #2), resulted in RECK-upregulation in
MDA-MB-231 cells (Supplementary Figure S7G, lanes
4, 5). These data are consistent with the idea that MS275
upregulates RECK (in RPM-negative breast cancer cell
lines) by inhibiting HDAC1, thereby increasing the
acetylation of its targets.

Effects of MS275 on RECK promoter
How does MS275 upregulate RECK in RPMnegative breast cancer cells? We confirmed that MS275
increased the level of acetylated histones, as monitored
using acetylated H4 (Ac-H4), in three cell lines: MCF7
(RPM-RIM+), T-47D (RPM+RIM+), and MDA-MB-231
(RPM-RIM-) (Supplementary Figure S7B–S7D, lanes 1,
2). As detected by chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)
assay, MS275 increased the amount of Ac-H4 bound to
three regions (termed P1, P2, and E1; Supplementary
Figure S7A) upstream of, or containing, RECK exon1 (Supplementary Figure S7B–S7D, lanes 5, 6). The
increase (especially in E1) seems to be modest in T-47D

Biological significance of RECK-inducibility
RPM was inversely correlated with the cells’ ability
to express RECK in response to MS275 (Figure 2; Table
1). Is there any biological significance or clinical relevance
in this finding? To address this issue, we first assessed the
effects of MS275, 5-azadC, or both on the growth/surival
of T-47D cells (RPM+RIM+; Figure 5A, 5B). Although
the growth was suppressed to some extent by treatment
with MS275 alone or 5-azadC alone (Figure 5A, blue and

insensitive to MS275 unless the CpG island has been demethylated. Some cell lines of each class are listed on the right-hand side.

RECK methylation patterns [T-47D (RPM+RIM+), MCF7
(RPM-RIM+), BT549 and SKBR3 (RPM-RIM-)] with a
RECK-activating anticancer drug, methotrexate (MTX)
[35]. T-47D (RPM+) showed lowest sensitivity to this drug
(Figure 5C; red line). Acute expression of RECK using

adenoviral vector made T-47D cells susceptible to MTX
(Figure 5D, black line), suggesting possible contribution
of RECK in MTX-induced growth inhibition.
Finally, we subjected two cell lines, T-47D and
MDA-MB-231, to Matrigel invasion assay in the
absence or presence of MS275 (Figure 5E, 5F) and found
significant suppression of invasion by MS275 in MDAMB-231 cells (RPM-; Figure 5F) but not in T-47D cells
(RPM+; Figure 5E). Taken together, these results support

may be useful in predicting effectiveness of certain
drugs, especially those activating RECK expression, in
suppressing malignant growth and behaviors of breast
cancer cells.

also RPM-positive. According to our findings in vitro
(Figure 2), treatment with both 5-azadC and MS275 may
be required to upregulate RECK in RPM-positive tumors
whereas MS275 alone may be sufficient to induce RECK
in RPM-negative tumors. Although the exact biological
responses of these particular tumors are unknown, our
data in vitro (Figure 5) as well as several previous studies
indicate its beneficial effects (tumor suppression). Hence,
the tumors that require extensive therapies (about a half
of RIM-positive cases) may be identified using RPM,
in conjunction with RIM and conventional molecular
markers (ER, PR, and HER2).
Two lines of new evidence indicate the involvement
of CpG methylaiton, especially RIM, in RECK silencing.
First, RIM was inversely correlated with the level of RECK
mRNA/protein among the cell lines (Figure 1; Table 1) and
tissue samples (Figure 4A–4C). Second, 5-azadC could
convert RIM+ cell lines susceptible to the activity of MS275
to induced RECK expression (Figure 2). This mechanism
of silencing, however, probably operate only in later stages
of mammary carcinogenesis, since RIM was negative in

DISCUSSION
Previous study by Hill et al. [5] revealed a strong
correlation between RIM found in tumor tissue and
relapse of the disease, which underscored the critical
role for RECK in tumor suppression. Practical value of
RIM as a prognostic marker, however, depends on the
availability of therapeutic options for subgroups of the
disease to be identified, especially the one with higher
risk. RPM developed in this study may be of value
in this respect, since it provides information on drug
sensitivity. For instance, RIM was positive in all cases
(n=10) of ER+PR- tumors examined in this study, while
RPM was positive only in 4 cases (Table 2). Similarly,
a half of all RIM-positive luminal tumors (n=26) were

MCF-10A (Figure 1B), most normal tissues (Figure 4B),
and DCIS (Table 2) while it was more frequent in highgrade carcinomas (28 of 43; 65%; Table 2).
ER+PR- breast cancers are known to be refractory to
anti-estrogen treatment and prone to relapse [36]. A recent
study indicate that progesterone inhibits estrogen-induced
growth of ER+ breast tumors and that copy number loss
of the PR gene is not rare among ER+ breast cancers [37].
The use of DNMT inhibitors in conjunctions with other
therapeutic agents, such as anti-estrogens, Cdk inhibitors
[38], HDAC inhibitors, or other RECK-activating agents
[35], may have potential value in treating such tumors.
Our data (Supplementary Figure S7) suggest the
involvement of HDAC1 in RECK gene repression. Our
data also suggest the dominant nature of CpG methylation
over this repression (Figure 2). We interpret that although
both RPM and RIM are involved in RECK gene silencing,
RPM probably represent a higher degree of silencing
than RIM alone (Figure 4G). The RPM area spans the
exon-1 and proximal promoter which harbors numerous
potential cis-regulatory elements and has a feature of
“CpG island shore” in which the degree of methylation
can be influenced by external stimuli, tissue of origin,
etc. [4, 39]. This may explain why RPM status varies
among RIM-positive tumors and better predicts the cells’
ability to express RECK in response to MS275. It remains
unknown, however, why two groups (RPM+ and RPM-)
of RIM-positive luminal cancers arise.
MCF7 and T-47D are commonly used cell lines
derived from luminal breast cancer. We found, however,
that they differed in the pattern of RECK CpG methylation
and RECK inducibility by chemicals. Molecular
mechanisms by which these differences arise are important
issues to be addressed in future studies. Some RIMnegative cell lines show different basal levels of RECK
expression (Figure 1D). For instance, in MDA-MB-231,
basal RECK expression was moderate (Figure 1D, lane/
bar 10) and further upregulated by MS275 (Figure 2H),
resulting in reduced Matrigel invasion (Figure 5F).
Effects of MS275 and other HDAC inhibitors on RECKexpression in, and the behaviors of, other RIM-negative
cells may also yield important insights. Studies on the
mechanism of action of MS275 in RECK-upregulation
may also provide some clues to better understanding how
RECK can be repressed in cancer cells.

Growth media used for maintainance of these cell lines are
shown in Table 1 and were supplemented with fetal bovine
serum (FBS; 5% for SUM-159PT and 10% for others).

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Total RNA was extracted using RNeasy Mini Kit
(QIAGEN). The levels of specific mRNA were determined
using SuperScript III Platinum SYBR Green One-Step
qRT-PCR Kit (Invitrogen) with the Mx 3005P RealTime
OCR System and Mx Pro software (Stratagene). Primers
for RECK mRNA and HPRT mRNA (internal standard) are
listed in Supplemental Table S1. The reaction conditions:
an initial reverse transcription [50°C, 5 min; 95°C, 5 min]
followed by 45 cycles of PCR [94 °C, 15 s; 54 °C (HPRT)
or 64°C (hRECK), 40 s; 72°C, 20 s].

Tissue samples
Breast cancer tissues from primary tumor sites were
collected through needle biopsy or surgical resection
performed in Department of Breast Surgery, Kyoto
University Hospital. Prior written informed consents
were obtained from all patients. The study protocols were
approved by the Ethics Committee for Clinical Research,
Kyoto University Hospital (authorization numbers G424).
Obtained sample was quickly frozen in liquid nitrogen
and stored under −80°C or liquid nitrogen until analyses.
Samples collected between May 2011 and June 2014
were used in this study. Pathological characterization was
performed as described previously [42]. For molecular
analyses, frozen tissues were homogenized using Bead
Smash 12 (Waken-yaku, Kyoto, Japan), and the total DNA
and RNA was extracted using QIAamp DNA Mini Kit
(QIAGEN) and RNeasy Mini Kit (QIAGEN), respectively.

Methylation analysis of RECK gene
COBRA [23] was used to assess the methylation
status of RECK gene. Bisulfite conversion of genomic
DNA was performed using EpiTect Bisulfite kit (Qiagen).
Primers for semi-nested PCRs are listed in Supplemental
Table S1. Primary PCRs (reaction volume, 25 μl) were
performed under the following conditions: 40 cycles of
PCR [94°C, 30 s; 50°C, 30 s; 72°C, 60 s] followed by
a final extension at 72°C for 5 min. Secondary PCRs
were performed using 3 μl of the first PCR product as
a template as follows: 45 cycles of PCR [94°C, 30 s;
53°C, 30 s; 72°C, 60 s] followed by a final extension at
72°C, 5 min. PCR products were digested with BstUI
(Fermentas, UK) at 37°C for 4 h and resolved by agarose
gel electrophoresis (1.5% agarose). For clone-sequencing,
PCR products were cloned into pTA2 vector (TOYOBO),
and 12 independent clones isolated were sequenced using
T3 and T7 primers. Methylation index is defined as the
ratio (%) of the number of methylated CpGs to the number
all CpGs present in the fragment.

Quantitative reverse transcription-PCR

Cell culture
The mammary epithelial cell line (MCF-10A) and
13 breast cancer cell lines (MCF7, MDA-MB-453, T-47D,
ZR-75-1, SK-BR-3, MDA-MB-468, HCC1937, HCC1954,
MDA-MB-231, BT549, Hs-578-T, HCC38, SUM-159PT)
were obtained from ATCC. Two breast cancer cell lines,
KPL-1 and KPL-3C, were described previously [40, 41].
