ABSTRACT:
Patients with neuroblastoma due to N-Myc oncogene amplification have a
high frequency of tumor metastasis. However, it is not clear how N-Myc induces
cell migration, invasion and metastasis. The histone demethylase JMJD1A activates
gene transcription by demethylating the lysine 9 residue of histone H3 (H3K9) at
target gene promoters. The long noncoding RNA MALAT1 induces lung cancer cell
migration and plays a pivotal role in lung cancer metastasis. Here we demonstrated
that N-Myc up-regulated the expression of JMJD1A in N-Myc oncogene-amplified
human neuroblastoma cells by directly binding to the JMJD1A gene promoter.
Affymetrix microarray studies revealed that the gene second most significantly upregulated by JMJD1A was MALAT1. Consistent with this finding, RT-PCR and chromatin
immunoprecipitation assays showed that JMJD1A bound to the MALAT1 gene promoter
and demethylated histone H3K9 at the MALAT1 gene promoter. Moreover, JMJD1A
and MALAT1 induced, while the small molecule JMJD1A inhibitor DMOG suppressed,
neuroblastoma cell migration and invasion. Taken together, our data identify a novel
pathway through which N-Myc causes neuroblastoma cell migration and invasion, and
provide important evidence for further development of more potent JMJD1A/MALAT1
inhibitors for the prevention of tumor metastasis.

INTRODUCTION

neuroblastoma patients [1, 2].
Myc oncoproteins, including N-Myc and c-Myc,
induce malignant transformation and tumor progression
by directly binding to cognate DNA sequences and
modulating gene transcription [3, 4]. Myc oncoproteins
activate gene transcription by directly binding to Mycresponsive element E-Boxes at target gene promoters.
Gene transcription is a dynamic process, during

Neuroblastoma, which originates from precursor
neuroblast cells in the sympathetic nervous systems, is
the most common extracranial solid tumor in children.
MYCN oncogene amplification and consequent N-Myc
mRNA and protein over-expression, are seen in a
quarter of tumors and correlate with poorer prognosis in

which lysine residues of histone H3 are modified by
histone demethylases and methyltransferases to change
RNA polymerase’s ability to access the transcription
start site [5, 6]. Many lines of evidence suggest that
demethylation of repressive histone methylation
marks such as histone H3 lysine 9 (H3K9) by histone
demethylases is a prerequisite for transcriptional activation
by transcription factors [7-9].
Also known as KDM3A and JHDM2A, JMJD1A
belongs to the Jumonji C-domain-containing protein
(JMJD) family, and demethylates mono-methyl and dimethyl histone H3K9 in vitro and in vivo [7-9]. While
JMJD1A gene expression is up-regulated by androgen
receptor activation [10], JMJD1A demethylates histone
H3K9 at promoter regions of androgen receptor target
genes, functions as a co-activator for androgen receptor,
and induces transcriptional activation of androgen
receptor target genes [9]. Similarly, whereas JMJD1A
gene expression is up-regulated by β-adrenergic
agonists, JMJD1A directly binds to promoter regions
of β-adrenergic agonist target genes such as Ucp1,
demethylates histone H3K9 at the promoters, and activates
gene transcription [7].
The long noncoding RNA MALAT1, also known
as NEAT2, is over-expressed in metastatic, compared
with primary, lung cancer tissues, and is associated with
poor prognosis in patients with non-small cell lung cancer
[11]. Recent studies show that knocking-down MALAT1
expression impairs lung adenocarcinoma cell mobility and
metastasis, suggesting the important role of MALAT1 in
lung cancer metastasis [12, 13].
In the current study, we identified one Mycresponsive element E-Box at the JMJD1A gene core
promoter, and showed that N-Myc up-regulated
JMJD1A gene transcription by binding to JMJD1A
gene promoter. JMJD1A demethylated histone H3K9 at
the MALAT1 gene promoter, leading to transcriptional
activation of MALAT1. These mechanisms contributed to
neuroblastoma cell migration and invasion, which could
be reversed by the small molecule JMJD1A inhibitor
DMOG.

the ENCODE/SYDH project. As shown in Fig. 1B, the
ChIP-seq data showed that the c-Myc oncoprotein bound
to the JMJD1A gene core promoter region encompassing
the E-Box in K562 and HeLa cells. Consistently, our
own ChIP assays showed that an anti-N-Myc antibody
efficiently immunoprecipitated the region of the JMJD1A
gene core promoter carrying the E-box in BE(2)-C
neuroblastoma cells (Fig. 1C). We next examined
possible modulation of JMJD1A expression by N-Myc.
As shown in Fig. 1D and Fig. 1E, transfection with
N-Myc siRNA No.1 (N-Myc siRNA-1) or No.2 (N-Myc
siRNA-2) reduced N-Myc mRNA and protein expression,
and transfection with JMJD1A siRNA-1 and JMJD1A
siRNA-2 knocked down JMJD1A mRNA and protein
expression in MYCN-amplified BE(2)-C and CHP134
human neuroblastoma cells. Importantly, N-Myc siRNA-1
and N-Myc siRNA-2 significantly reduced JMJD1A
mRNA and protein expression in the two neuroblastoma
cell lines (Fig. 1D and Fig. 1E). Taken together, our data
suggest that N-Myc up-regulates JMJD1A expression by
directly binding to its gene core promoter.

N-Myc modulates target gene expression partly
through up-regulating JMJD1A gene expression
JMJD1A exerts biological effects by demethylating
mono-methyl and di-methyl histone H3K9 and
consequently modulating gene transcription [7-9]. We
therefore performed differential gene expression studies
with Affymetrix microarray in BE(2)-C cells 30 hours
after transfection with scrambled control, JMJD1A
siRNA-1 or N-Myc siRNA-1. Microarray data were
subjected to normalization, summarization, annotation and
differential gene expression analysis in R (http://www.rproject.org/) with bioconductor package (http://www.
bioconductor.org/). We used 1.5 fold change as the cut-off
for JMJD1A siRNA-1 versus control siRNA experiment
and 2.0 fold change as the cut-off for N-Myc siRNA-1
versus control siRNA experiment, since JMJD1A siRNA-1
caused less changes in gene expression in 30 hours. The
genome-wide analysis revealed that JMJD1A siRNA-1
reduced the expression of 0.15% (63 probes/41717 probes)
of genes, but up-regulated the expression of 0.67% (280
probes/41717 probes) of genes (Supplementary Table
S1). In comparison, the genome-wide analysis revealed
that N-Myc siRNA-1 reduced the expression of 1.22%
(260 probes/21255 probes) of genes, but up-regulated the
expression of 1.40% (298 probes/21255 probes) of genes
(Supplementary Table S2).
Importantly, while 1.59% (1 probe/63 probes)
of genes down-regulated by JMJD1A siRNA-1 were
up-regulated by N-Myc siRNA-1 (Fig. 2A), 7.94% (5
probes/63 probes) of genes down-regulated by JMJD1A
siRNA-1 were also down-regulated by N-Myc siRNA-1
(Fig. 2B). In comparison, while 0.36% (1 probe/280

By screening human histone demethylase gene
promoter regions with GenoMatix software, we found
one Myc-responsive element E-box -420bp upstream of
the JMJD1A gene transcription start site (Fig. 1A). We

probes) of genes up-regulated by JMJD1A siRNA-1 were
down-regulated by N-Myc siRNA-1 (Fig. 2C), 11.07%
(31 probes/280 probes) of genes up-regulated by JMJD1A
siRNA-1 were also up-regulated by N-Myc siRNA-1
(Fig. 2D). To validate the Affymetrix microarray data,
we performed RT-PCR analysis of FAM73A and HTR2B,
which were up-regulated by both JMJD1A siRNA-1 and
N-Myc siRNA-1 (Fig. 2D). RT-PCR studies confirmed that
transfection with JMJD1A siRNA-1, JMJD1A siRNA-2,
N-Myc siRNA-1 or N-Myc siRNA-2 significantly
increased FAM73A and HTR2B mRNA expression in
neuroblastoma cells (Fig. 2E). Taken together, the data
suggested that JMJD1A and N-Myc commonly upregulate the expression of a subset of genes and commonly

down-regulate the expression of a subset of genes, and that
N-Myc modulates target gene expression partly through
up-regulating JMJD1A gene expression.

S2) which were acquired from BE(2)-C neuroblastoma
cells 30 hours after siRNA transfections. As N-Myc upregulated JMJD1A expression (Fig. 1), we examined
whether both JMJD1A siRNAs and N-Myc siRNAs
reduced MALAT1 expression at a later time point. Realtime RT-PCR analysis showed that knocking-down
JMJD1A or N-Myc expression with JMJD1A siRNA-1,
JMJD1A siRNA-2, N-Myc siRNA-1 or N-Myc siRNA-2
for 48 hours all significantly reduced MALAT1 expression
in both BE(2)-C and CHP134 cells (Fig. 3A).
JMJD1A is known to up-regulate gene transcription
by demethylating mono-methyl and di-methyl histone
H3K9 [7-9]. We therefore performed ChIP assays with
a control IgG, anti-JMJD1A antibody or anti-N-Myc
antibody and PCR with primers targeting the MALAT1
gene core promoter or a negative control region. Results
showed that the anti-JMJD1A antibody, but not the antiN-Myc antibody, efficiently immunoprecipitated the
MALAT1 gene core promoter (Fig. 3B and Fig. 3C). To
confirm that JMJD1A demethylated histone H3K9 at the
MALAT1 gene promoter, we transfected BE(2)-C cells
with control siRNA or JMJD1A siRNA-1 for 48 hours,
followed by ChIP assays with a control IgG or an anti-dimethyl H3K9 antibody and PCR with primers targeting the
MALAT1 gene core promoter or a negative control region.
Results showed that JMJD1A siRNA-1 significantly
increased the presence of di-methyl histone H3K9 at the
MALAT1 gene promoter (Fig. 3D). Taken together, the
data suggest that JMJD1A up-regulates MALAT1 gene
expression by directly binding to the MALAT1 gene
promoter, leading to histone H3K9 demethylation, and
that N-Myc indirectly up-regulates MALAT1 expression
by activating JMJD1A gene transcription.

We next examined whether JMJD1A contributed
to a cancer phenotype. Alamar blue assays showed that
knocking-down JMJD1A gene expression with JMJD1A
siRNA-1 or JMJD1A siRNA-2 for 72 hours did not have a
significant effect on BE(2)-C cell proliferation, but slightly
reduced CHP134 cell proliferation (Fig. 4A). We therefore
used BE(2)-C cells for cell migration and invasion assays.
For cell migration assays, BE(2)-C cells were plated into
6 well plates with Ibidi Culture Inserts in the centre, and
transfected with control siRNA, JMJD1A siRNA-1 or
JMJD1A siRNA-2. Sixteen hours later, the inserts were
removed to create “wounds”. Measurement of the area of
the “wounds” showed that JMJD1A siRNAs, compared
with control siRNAs, increased the area of the remaining
“wounds” by approximately 30% and 150% respectively,
32 hours and 48 hours after the removal of the inserts
(Fig. 4B). For cell invasion assays, BE(2)-C cells were
transfected with control siRNA, JMJD1A siRNA-1 or
JMJD1A siRNA-2 for 20 hours. After being detached,

into 6 well plates with Ibidi Culture Inserts in the centre,
transfected with control siRNA, MALAT1 siRNA-1 or

assays after the removal of the inserts. Measurement of
the area of the “wounds” showed that MALAT1 siRNA-1
and MALAT1 siRNA-2, compared with control siRNA,
increased the area of remaining “wounds” by 47% and
34% respectively thirty-two hours after the removal of
the inserts, and by 248% and 68% respectively fortyeight hours after the removal of the inserts (Fig. 5C). For
cell invasion assays, BE(2)-C cells were transfected with

for 20 hours, and then added onto Matrigel-coated BD

and its derivatives as histone demethylase inhibitors, and
demonstrated that its dimethyl ester prodrug DMOG
exerted histone lysine methylating activity in cells [14].
As DMOG was inactive outside cells and NOG could not
permeate into cells, we analysed the selectivity and activity
of NOG/DMOG against various histone demethylases in
vitro by using NOG as the model compound. As shown
in Table 1 and Supplementary Fig. S1, NOG selectively
inhibited JMJD1A with an IC50 of 67μM, and inhibited
other histone demethylases at much higher concentrations.
Next we examined the effects of DMOG on
neuroblastoma cell proliferation, migration and invasion.

cells, and treatment with DMOG at a range of doses had
no effect on cell proliferation. For cell migration assays,
BE(2)-C cells were plated into 6 well plates with Ibidi
Culture Inserts in the centre, and treated with vehicle
control or 67μM DMOG after the removal of the inserts.

“Wound” healing assays showed that DMOG increased the
area of remaining “wounds” by approximately 47% and
895% respectively 32 hours and 48 hours after the removal
of the inserts (Fig. 6C). For cell invasion assays, BE(2)-C
cells were treated with vehicle control or 67μM DMOG for
20 hours, and then added onto Matrigel-coated BD Falcon
Cell Culture Inserts inside BD BioCoat Matrigel Invasion
Chambers. Quantification of cells which had invaded
through the Matrigel 22 hours later, showed that DMOG
reduced BE(2)-C cell invasion by approximately 52%
(Fig. 6D). The data suggest that suppression of JMJD1A
activity with the small molecule inhibitor DMOG can be
used to reduce neuroblastoma cell migration and invasion.

DISCUSSION.
JMJD1A gene expression is down-regulated by the
microRNA mir-155 [15], and up-regulated by hypoxiainducible factor 1α (HIF1α), hypoxia, starvation and iron
scavengers in tumor tissues [16-20]. Myc oncoproteins,
including N-Myc and c-Myc, are well-known to exert
oncogenic effects by binding to Myc-responsive element
E-boxes at target gene promoters, leading to transcriptional
activation [3], and by binding to Sp1-binding sites at target
gene promoters, leading to transcriptional repression [2123]. In this study, we have identified a canonical Mycresponsive element E-Box at the JMJD1A gene core
promoter, and found that c-Myc oncoprotein binds to
JMJD1A gene core promoter encompassing the E-Box in a
publicly available ChIP-Seq dataset. Our own experiments
have confirmed that N-Myc directly binds to JMJD1A
gene core promoter and up-regulates JMJD1A mRNA
and protein expression in neuroblastoma cells. Taken
together, these data suggest that N-Myc oncoprotein upregulates JMJD1A gene expression by directly binding to
the JMJD1A gene core promoter.
As a histone demethylase, JMJD1A exerts
biological effects by demethylating mono-methyl and
di-methyl histone H3K9 and consequently modulating
gene transcription [7-9]. While mono-methyl and dimethyl histone H3K9 at gene promoters are markers for
transcriptional repression [24], di-methyl histone H3K9
has also been shown to be present at actively transcribed
gene regions [25]. Our genome-wide differential gene
expression study with Affymetrix microarray shows
that knocking-down JMJD1A with siRNA leads to four
times as many genes up-regulated than genes downregulated in neuroblastoma cells. The result suggests that
JMJD1A can function as a transcriptional activator and
a repressor, but predominantly a transcriptional repressor
in neuroblastoma cells. Furthermore, our genome-wide
differential gene expression study confirms that JMJD1A
and N-Myc commonly up- and down-regulate the
expression of a subset of genes. As N-Myc up-regulates
JMJD1A gene expression, the data suggest that N-Myc
modulates gene expression partly through up-regulating

JMJD1A expression.
One of the genes most significantly reduced by
JMJD1A siRNAs in our Affymetrix microarray study
is the long noncoding RNA MALAT1. Our RT-PCR
and ChIP assays confirm that JMJD1A directly binds
to the MALAT1 gene core promoter, and demethylates
histone H3K9 at the MALAT1 gene core promoter. The
data indicate that JMJD1A up-regulates MALAT1 gene
expression by demethylating H3K9 at the MALAT1 gene
core promoter. This is consistent with previous reports that
JMJD1A activates gene transcription by demethylating
histone H3K9 at promoter regions of target genes, such
as transition protein-1, protamine 1 [8, 26], differentiation
growth factor 15 [27], peroxisome proliferator-activated
receptor α and mitochondrial uncoupling protein 1
[7]. Additionally, our RT-PCR and ChIP experiments
show that, while N-Myc up-regulates MALAT1 gene
expression, N-Myc protein does not bind to the MALAT1
gene promoter. This suggests that N-Myc up-regulates
MALAT1 expression indirectly through modulating
JMJD1A gene expression.
JMJD1A has been well documented to induce
tumor progression by up-regulating HIF1α expression
and stimulating angiogenesis [16, 18, 20, 27]. Recent
studies show that JMJD1A is highly expressed in
metastatic human prostate and colorectal cancer tissues,
compared with primary tumors [16, 28]. Likewise, the
long noncoding RNA MALAT1 is over-expressed in
metastatic human lung, liver and colorectal cancer tissues
[11, 29-31], and a high level of MALAT1 expression is
associated with poor prognosis in patients with non-small
cell lung cancer [11]. Additionally, recent studies show
that MALAT1 induces liver and colorectal cancer cell
migration and invasion in vitro [29, 31], and induces lung
cancer cell migration, invasion and metastasis in vitro
and in vivo [12, 13]. The current study demonstrates that
JMJD1A exerts minor effects, while MALAT1 shows no
effect, on neuroblastoma cell proliferation. Importantly,
knocking-down JMJD1A and MALAT1 gene expression
significantly reduces neuroblastoma cell migration and
invasion. As N-Myc oncoprotein up-regulates JMJD1A
expression and JMJD1A induces MALAT1 expression,
our data suggest that N-Myc oncoprotein induces
neuroblastoma cell migration and invasion through upregulating JMJD1A expression, and that JMJD1A induces
neuroblastoma cell migration and invasion through upregulating MALAT1 expression.
Long noncoding RNAs exert biological effects
mainly through regulating gene transcription in cis and
in trans [32, 33]. Recent genome-wide differential gene
expression and RT-PCR studies show that MALAT1
decreases the expression of the anti-metastatic MIA2
(melanoma inhibitory activity 2) and ROBO1 (roundabout
1), and up-regulates the expression of the pro-metastatic
GPC6 (glypican 6), LPHN2 (latrophilin 2), CDCP1 (CUB
domain containing protein 1) and ABCA1 (ATP-binding

cassette, sub-family A, member 1) in lung cancer cells
[13]. In this study, our Affymetrix microarray and RTPCR data show that knocking-down JMJD1A and N-Myc
gene expression commonly up-regulates HTR2B gene
expression. As stable MALAT1 knockout in lung cancer
cells up-regulates HTR2B expression [13] and silencing
of HTR2B is a marker for ovarian tumor metastasis in
ovarian cancer patients [34], we propose that repression
of HTR2B expression contributes to MALAT1-mediated
tumor cell migration, invasion and metastasis.
Histone deacetylase inhibitors are among the most
promising novel anticancer agents [35], and have been
approved by US Food and Drug Administration for
cancer therapy. The current study shows that the small
molecule JMJD1A inhibitor DMOG reduces MALAT1
gene expression, does not have an effect on neuroblastoma
cell proliferation, but significantly reduces neuroblastoma
cell migration and invasion. This is consistent with recent
reports that repression of JMJD1A or MALAT1 with
small hairpin RNAs or antisense oligonucleotides do
not affect tumor cell proliferation, but reduce tumor cell
migration, invasion and metastasis in vitro and in vivo
[13, 27]. Our data indicate that more potent and selective
JMJD1A inhibitors may be efficacious in blocking tumor
cell migration, invasion and metastasis in cancer patients.
In summary, this study demonstrates that a novel
pathway, involving transcriptional up-regulation of
JMJD1A, which demethylates histone H3K9 at MALAT1
gene promoter and activates MALAT1 gene transcription,
plays an important role in N-Myc oncoprotein-mediated
neuroblastoma cell migration and invasion. Moreover,
the small molecule JMJD1A inhibitor DMOG reduces
MALAT1 expression and suppresses neuroblastoma cell
migration and invasion. These findings therefore identify
JMJD1A and MALAT1 as important factors for N-Mycmediated neuroblastoma cell migration, invasion and
potentially metastasis, and provide important evidence
for further development of more selective and potent
JMJD1A/MALAT1 inhibitors for the prevention of tumor
metastasis.

METHODS
Cell culture
Neuroblastoma BE(2)-C and CHP134 cells
were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium
supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum.

siRNA transfection
Cells were transfected with siRNAs from
Qiagen (Qiagen, Hamburg, Germany) or Ambion
(Ambion, Austin, TX, USA) using Lipofectamine
1801

Oncotarget

Cell migration assays

2000 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) reagent as we
described [22, 23]. The target sequences for N-Myc
siRNAs
were
CCCGGACGAAGATGACTTCTA
and CGTGCCGGAGTTGGTAAAGAA, JMJD1A
siRNAs
GCACAGTCCTCCATACGTT
and
GGAUGUAAACAGUCUUCGA,
and
MALAT1
siRNAs CACAGGGAAAGCGAGUGGUUGGU and
GACAGGUAUCUCUUCGUUA.

Ibidi Culture Inserts (DKSH, Sydney, Australia)
were placed in the center of 6 well plates. BE(2)-C cells
were added into the wells outside the inserts. Sixteen
hours later, the inserts were removed to create “wounds”.
Photos of the “wounds” were taken under microscope,
and the areas of the remaining “wounds” were measured
and analyzed with Image J software (National Institutes
of Health, USA).

RT-PCR and immunoblot analyses

Cell invasion assays

Gene expression in tumor cells was examined by
quantitative real-time RT-PCR as described previously
[21, 36]. For the analysis of protein expression by
immunoblot, cells were lysed, protein extracted and
separated by gel electrophoresis. After western transfer,
membranes were probed with mouse anti-N-Myc antibody
(1:1000) (Santa Cruz Biotech, CA, USA) or rabbit antiJMJD1A antibody (1:500) (Abcam, Cambridge, MA,
USA), followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated
anti-mouse (1:10000) or anti-rabbit (1:20000) antiserum
(Santa Cruz Biotech). Protein bands were visualized with
SuperSignal (Pierce, Rockford, IL, USA). The membranes
were lastly re-probed with an anti-actin antibody (Sigma,
St Louis, MO, USA) as loading controls.

BE(2)-C cells were transfected with siRNA or
treated with JMJD1A inhibitors for 20 hours, and then
detached and added onto BD Falcon Cell Culture Inserts
coated with Matrigel inside BD BioCoat Matrigel Invasion
Chambers (Becton Dickinson, Bedford, MA, USA). Cells
invaded through Matrigel to the bottom side of the inserts
were stained with toluidine blue, photographed under
microscope and quantified.

ChIP assays
ChIP assays were performed with an anti-N-Myc,
anti-JMJD1A, anti-di-methyl H3K9 or control antibody
and PCR with primers targeting up-stream negative
control region or core promoter region of the JMJD1A or
MALAT1 gene promoter with the protocol we described
[38]. Fold enrichment of the JMJD1A or MALAT1 gene
core promoter by the anti-N-Myc, anti-JMJD1A or antidi-methyl H3K9 antibody was calculated by dividing PCR
products from the gene core promoter region by PCR
products from the up-stream negative control region.

Affymetrix microarray study
Neuroblastoma BE(2)-C cells were transfected
with scrambled control siRNA, N-Myc siRNA-1 or
JMJD1A siRNA-1. Thirty hours after transfection,
RNA was extracted from the cells with RNeasy mini
kit. Differential gene expression was examined with
Affymetrix Arrays (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA, USA),
according to the manufacturer’s instruction. Results from
the microarray hybridization were analysed in R (http://
www.r-project.org/) with bioconductor package (http://
www.bioconductor.org/).

Histone demethylase inhibition assays
The inhibitory activities of NOG against JMJD1A
were assayed according to a previously reported method
[39]. The inhibitory activity of NOG against JMJD2A
and JMJD2C were assayed according to the method we
reported previously [40]. The JARID1A activity after
treatment with vehicle control or NOG was measured
by the formaldehyde dehydrogenase-coupled assay as
described for JMJD2A and JMJD2C, except that reactions
were performed with H3K4me3 peptide in a final volume
of 30 μL in 384-well plate and a final concentration of
JARID1A was 0.64 mg/mL.

Cell proliferation assays
Cell proliferation was examined with Alamar blue
assays [37]. Briefly, cells were plated into 96 well plates,
transfected with various siRNAs or treated with different
dosages of DMOG. Seventy-two hours later, cells were
incubated with Alamar blue (Invitrogen) for 5 hours, and
plates were then read on a micro-plate reader at 570/595
nm. Results were calculated according to the optical
density absorbance units and expressed as percentage
changes in cell numbers.

Statistical analysis
All data for statistical analysis were calculated as
mean ± standard error, and differences were analyzed for
