Summary
NIH-PA Author Manuscript

NF-κB transcription factors function as crucial regulators of inflammatory and immune responses
as well as cell survival 1. They have also been implicated in cellular transformation and tumorigenesis
2–6. However, despite extensive biochemical characterization of NF-κB signaling during the past
twenty years, the requirement for NF-κB in tumor development in vivo, particularly in solid tumors,
is not completely understood. Here we show that the NF-κB pathway is required for the development
of tumors in a mouse model of lung adenocarcinoma. Concomitant loss of p53 and expression of
oncogenic K-rasG12D resulted in NF-κB activation in primary mouse embryonic fibroblasts.
Conversely, in lung tumor cell lines expressing K-rasG12D and lacking p53, p53 restoration led to
NF-κB inhibition. Additionally, inhibition of NF-κB signaling induced apoptosis in p53 null lung
cancer cell lines. Inhibition of the pathway in lung tumors in vivo, from the time of tumor initiation
or following tumor progression, resulted in significantly reduced tumor development. Together, these
results suggest a critical function for NF-κB signaling in lung tumor development and, further, that
this requirement depends on p53 status. These findings also provide support for the development of
NF-κB inhibitory drugs as targeted therapies for the treatment of patients with defined mutations in
K-ras and p53.

More than one million people die from lung cancer each year in the world, making it the leading
cause of cancer mortality of both women and men. Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)
accounts for 80% of all lung cancer cases, with adenocarcinoma being the major subtype.
NSCLC development is associated with frequent mutations in a few well-defined oncogenes
and tumor suppressor genes. Oncogenic K-ras mutations occur in approximately 20–30% of

patients with lung adenocarcinoma, whereas inactivating mutations in the tumor suppressor
protein p53 are found in at least 50% NSCLC cases 7. The overexpression of oncogenic forms
of Ras has been reported to result in NF-κB activation 3,8, while wild-type (WT) p53 has been
shown to antagonize NF-κB activity 9–14. Therefore, we hypothesized that induction of
endogenous K-rasG12D or p53 deletion might affect the NF-κB signaling pathway. We used
primary mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) carrying either the Cre-activatable K-rasG12D
allele (K-rasLox-STOP-Lox (LSL)-G12D/WT), a conditional loss-of-function p53 allele
(p53Flox/Flox), or the two in combination (K-rasLSL-G12D/WT; p53Flox/Flox) 15–17. Cells were
infected with adenoviruses expressing either Cre (to activate oncogenic K-ras and/or inactivate
p53) or FlpO recombinase (as a control). As shown in Figure 1a, activation of K-rasG12D with
concomitant loss of p53 led to an increased nuclear accumulation of the NF-κB transcription
factor subunit p65, a prerequisite for NF-κB activity. In contrast, p65 remained exclusively
cytoplasmic upon K-rasG12D expression in WT p53-expressing cells or upon loss of p53 in the
absence of K-rasG12D expression, suggesting that the combination of mutations is required for
enhanced NF-κB activation, at least in these cells. Of note, another NF-κB subunit, c-Rel,
showed a slight increase in nuclear localization upon p53 loss, both alone and upon KrasG12D expression (Fig. 1a), perhaps reflecting crosstalk between p53 and c-Rel. We next
addressed whether restoration of p53 expression in p53-mutant cells might influence p65
nuclear localization. We utilized K-rasG12D-expressing lung adenocarcinoma cell lines with a
Cre-activatable WT-p53 allele, which were derived from lung tumors of mice generated
through the crossing of K-rasLA2/WT (ref. 18) and p53LSL/LSL; Cre-ERT2 (ref. 19) mice (D.M.F.
and T.J., unpublished). In the absence of p53 restoration, nuclear p65 was evident in these cells,
consistent with the data from MEFs (see Fig. 1a). Upon 4-hydroxytamoxifen-induced p53
restoration, p65 nuclear localization was diminished (Fig. 1b). In contrast, the nuclear levels
of c-Rel remained unchanged. Reduced levels of nuclear p65 were not simply a consequence
of cell cycle arrest, because p65 remained detectable in the nucleus of cells arrested through
culturing in 0.1% serum. Importantly, restoration of p53 and decreased nuclear p65 were
associated with reduced expression of the NF-κB-target gene Tnf (Fig. 1c). Expression of
Glut3, which contributes to and is upregulated by NF-κB activity in p53-deficient MEFs 10,
was also reduced upon restoration of p53 (Fig. 1c).

Using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), we directly monitored NF-κB activity
in lung adenocarcinoma cell lines derived from tumors generated in the conditional compound
knock-in (K-rasLSL-G12D/WT; p53Flox/Flox) mouse. These mice (hereafter referred to as KP
mice) develop advanced lung cancers that closely recapitulate the development of human lung
adenocarcinoma 15. In KP tumor cell lines, NF-κB p65 DNA-binding activity was consistently
higher than in cell lines derived from the K-rasLA2/WT allele (LKR), which also express KrasG12D but retain WT p53 expression (Fig. 2a). We also examined NF-κB activity in human
NSCLC cell lines that harbor gain-of-function mutations in K-ras but differ in their p53 status.
Consistent with the mouse data, NF-κB p65 DNA-binding activity was increased in p53 mutant,
compared to WT p53 cell lines, with one exception (Fig. 2b). Notably, nuclear p65 was higher
in the p53 mutant cells (Supplementary Fig. 1). Hence, canonical NF-κB signaling is elevated
in lung tumor-derived cells with altered p53.
To determine if NF-κB provides pro-survival signals in KP cell lines, we examined the
consequences of pathway inhibition. Cell viability was monitored following infection of cells
with lentiviruses expressing a non-phosphorylatable, dominant-negative form of IκBα (Super
Repressor, IκB-SR). As shown in Figure 3a, expression of IκB-SR led to reduced KP cell
viability. In contrast, the two LKR cell lines expressing mutant K-ras and WT p53 (LKR10
and LKR13) were insensitive to IκB-SR expression. These results are consistent with the data
showing increased NF-κB activity in KP cells (see Fig. 2a). NF-κB signaling was also inhibited
via shRNA-mediated knock-down of NEMO, an essential factor in the canonical NF-κB
pathway 20,21. Infection of LKR, KP and 3TZ fibroblast cell lines with pSicoRev retroviral

vectors 22 expressing one of two hairpins targeting NEMO resulted in efficient knock-down
in all cases, while apoptosis (as measured by cleaved caspase-3 detection) was only triggered
in the KP cell line (Fig. 3b). To establish if one of the two NF-κB subunits, p65 or c-Rel,
transmitted these anti-apoptotic effects, we used shRNA-mediated knock-down to inhibit them
in the same cells. Knock-down of p65, but not of c-Rel, led to reduced cell viability and cleavage
of caspase-3 (Fig. 3c,d). These results demonstrate that in the context of oncogenic K-ras
expression and p53 mutation, the canonical NEMO-, IκB- and p65-dependent NF-κB signaling
pathway is required for survival of lung cell lines.

In order to understand the relevance of these findings in vivo, we examined the NF-κB signaling
pathway during lung adenocarcinoma development in KP mice. Tumors from KP mice
exhibited enhanced NF-κB p65 nuclear localization by immunohistochemistry when compared
to tumors from K-rasG12D mice (K-rasLSL-G12D/WT, Supplementary Fig. 2). To test the
functional requirement for NF-κB in tumor initiation and development, we infected KP mice
with a bi-functional lentivirus capable of expressing both IκB-SR and Cre constitutively from
independent promoters or a control lentivirus carrying only Cre (Supplementary Fig. 3a). Each
mouse was either infected with low- (5×103) or high-titer (5×104) lentiviral particles.
Seventeen weeks after infection with low titer control viruses, an average of 30 tumors were
detected per mouse (Fig. 4a, left), whereas mice infected with lentiviruses expressing Cre and
IκB-SR had either a single tumor or none at all. Using the high titer lentiviruses, a similarly
dramatic difference between Cre- and IκB-SR-Cre-infected mice was observed (90–131
tumors compared to 6–22; Fig. 4a, right). Thus, inhibition of NF-κB at the time of tumor
initiation in the KP mouse model had a profound effect on subsequent tumor development. To
determine if NF-κB was required to maintain the growth and/or viability of established tumors,
we cloned IκB-SR into a lentiviral construct downstream of a tetracycline-response element
(TRE), to generate a doxycycline (dox)-inducible version of IκB-SR (see Supplementary Fig.
3a,b). KP mice were crossed to clara cell secretory protein (CCSP)-rtTA transgenic mice, which
express the reverse tetracycline transactivator (rtTA) specifically in lung epithelial cells 23.
KP; CCSP-rtTA+ mice and KP; CCSP-rtTA− littermate controls were infected with
TRE.IκB-SR; Pgk.Cre lentiviruses to initiate tumorigenesis. In an initial experiment, infected
mice were put on a dox diet continuously from the day of infection. Fifteen weeks later, lung
tumor development was analyzed using in vivo micro-computed tomography (µ-CT) imaging.
As we observed with constitutive IκB-SR expression, dox-mediated IκB-SR induction from
the time of tumor initiation led to significant impairment of tumor development (Fig. 4b). To
address the role of NF-κB in tumor maintenance, cohorts of infected mice were imaged by µCT at 15 weeks post-infection to establish pre-treatment lung tumor volumes. One week later,
the mice were placed on a dox diet to induce the expression of IκB-SR specifically in the tumor
cells and imaged weekly for a total of five weeks. As shown in Figure 4c, IκB-SR expression
resulted in a significantly diminished tumor growth rate over time compared to controls. Thus,
established tumors with an activating mutation in K-ras and loss of p53 function are sensitive
to NF-κB inhibition.
To begin to explore the effects of NF-κB inhibition in this system, we examined the expression
levels of certain NF-κB target genes by real-time PCR after one week of dox treatment, starting
at 14 weeks post-infection. Of note, IκBα levels (which correspond to both endogenous IκBα
and the exogenous IκB-SR) were about 5-fold higher in IκB-SR-expressing tumors,
demonstrating the efficiency of the dox-inducible system (Fig. 4d and Supplementary Table
1). Contrary to our expectations, the expression of three NF-κB targets that inhibit apoptosis,
Bcl2, Bclx and Xiap, did not significantly change following dox treatment. In contrast, Tnf and
Il6 mRNA levels were increased in tumors expressing IκB-SR. The induction of these
inflammatory genes is likely due to infiltrating inflammatory cells recruited to tumors in which
NF-κB has been inhibited (Supplementary Fig. 4). Such inflammatory response has been

Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death in the world. To develop more effective
treatments, it is essential to characterize the pathways that control tumor cell proliferation and
survival, which will differ depending on the specific genetic context of individual tumors. Our
data establish a critical role for the NF-κB pathway in lung cancer cells harboring mutations
in the commonly mutated genes, K-ras and p53. These results, which corroborate earlier studies
demonstrating the importance of NF-κB signaling in a chemical-induced lung tumor model
25, provide a basis to consider the pharmacological inhibition of the NF-κB pathway in the
treatment of lung cancer. Because canonical NF-κB signaling serves anti-inflammatory and
immunosuppressive functions in macrophages 26,27, phenotypes that are regularly observed in
tumor-associated macrophages, NF-κB inhibition might serve dual functions. Indeed, NF-κB
inhibition may directly affect tumor epithelial cell survival and the tumor microenvironment,
by recruiting and/or converting neutrophils or macrophages toward pro-inflammatory and
tumoricidal phenotypes.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

The therapeutic inhibition of NF-κB has been viewed with caution upon the discovery of
diverse functions of this pathway in different physiological instances 28. Our study suggests a
re-evaluation of the importance of targeting NF-κB in cancer. With an a priori knowledge of
the genetic mutations of the tumors, treatment with NF-κB inhibitors may become an important
option of targeted therapy for lung cancer.

Virus production and infection

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

293T cells were transfected using Fugene (Roche) with pMD2G (VSV-G protein), Δ8.2
(lentivirus packaging vector, kindly provided by I. Verma, Salk Institute, La Jolla, California)
and expression plasmid. Viral supernatants were harvested 48 and 72 hours post-transfection,
filtered, and used directly for infection of cell lines. For mouse experiments, virus preparation
and mouse infection protocols were previously described 29. 2- to 3-month old mice were
intratracheally infected with 5×103, 104 or 5×104 lentiviral particles, or with 107 adenoviral
particles expressing Cre (AdCre), as indicated.

Methods
Measurement of lung tumor volumes
Mice were anesthetized using isoflurane, and were under anesthesia during the entire scanning
procedure. Lungs were imaged at the Koch Institute Microscopy and Imaging Core Facility by
µ-CT. Image acquisition was performed using eXplore Scan Control software, using a 45 µm

voxel size program, and 3D reconstruction was performed using eXplore Reconstruction
Utility software (both from GE Healthcare). High-resolution files of the lung scans were
generated and individual tumor volumes were measured and calculated using MicroView
software (GE Healthcare). For Fig. 4b, the lung surface opacity was set to 25%.
Histology and immunohistochemistry
Mouse lungs were inflated and then fixed in 3.6% formaldehyde in PBS for 24 hours,
transferred to 70% EtOH, and embedded in paraffin. 4 µm tissue sections were either
deparaffinized and stained with hematoxylin and eosin to count tumor numbers (Fig. 4a), or
used for immunohistochemistry. In this case, sections were deparaffinized, boiled in 10 mM
Na-citrate, washed in H2O, treated with 1% H2O2 for 10 minutes, washed in H2O and in PBS.
Blocking was done for 1 hour in PBS with 5% goat serum, followed by incubation with antip65 antibodies (C-20, 1/200) for 1 hour, then by washing and staining with biotin-conjugated
secondary antibodies (1 hour). After washing, avidin-biotinylated HRP complexes were added
during 30 minutes (ABC kit, Vectastain), and the complexes were revealed with a DAB
peroxidase substrate kit (#SK-4100, Vector Laboratories). The tissues were counterstained
with methyl green and mounted.
Expression vectors

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Super Repressor IκB (IκB-SR) was cloned from a mouse expressed sequenced tag with a 5’
oligo that added an EcoRI site followed by a Kozak sequence prior to the START codon, and
mutating codons for Ser32 and Ser36 into Alanine-encoding ones. The 3’ oligo introduced a
silent mutation removing an EcoRI site in the gene sequence, deleted the IκB STOP codon,
added a FLAG tag sequence followed by a STOP and a NotI site. IκB-SR was amplified using
Pfx polymerase (Invitrogen), and was cloned into EcoRI-NotI sites located next to a UbC
promoter in a dual-promoter lentiviral vector that also expresses Cre from the Pgk promoter.
To generate a doxycycline-responsive FLAG-IκB-SR version, IκB-SR was PCR amplified
with oligos adding EcoRI sites on both ends, and cloned into an EcoRI-digested TRE; Pgk.Cre
lentiviral vector (pCW22), downstream of the TRE promoter. shRNAs to NEMO, c-Rel and
p65 were designed by the pSICOLIGOMAKER 1.5 program
(http://web.mit.edu/jacks-lab/protocols/pSico.html; created by A. Ventura, Memorial SloanKettering Cancer Center, New York). Oligos were annealed and ligated into pSicoRev
retroviral vectors, as described 22. The fidelity of the PCR amplifications and oligo syntheses
were confirmed by sequencing.
Cell culture conditions

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

The human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293T and mouse fibroblasts 3TZ cells were grown in
Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s Medium (DMEM). LKR (LKR10, LKR13) and KP cell lines
were grown in Minimum Essential Medium (MEM). Lung cells derived from K-rasLA2/WT;
p53LSL/LSL; Cre-ERT2 (not published) tumors were grown in DMEM. A549 and SW1573 cell
lines were grown in a 1:1 mixture of F12 and DMEM. H23, H2122, H441, H460, Calu-6,
H1944, H2009 and H727 were grown in RPMI. All human cell lines were obtained from the
ATCC. Early passage mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs, all obtained from the indicated
genotypes in pure 129 backgrounds) were cultured with DMEM. All cell media were
supplemented with 1% glutamine, 50 units/ml penicillin, 50 µg/ml streptomycin and 10% heat
inactivated FBS.
Statistics
P-values were all determined by Student’s t tests.

Nuclear-cytoplasmic fractionations

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Cells in 10 cm dishes were washed with cold PBS and harvested by scraping following addition
of lysis buffer A (HEPES pH 7.6 20 mM, 20% glycerol, 10 mM NaCl, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 0.2
mM EDTA, 1 mM DTT, 0.1% NP-40, and a proteinase inhibitor cocktail (Roche)). Lysis was
completed on ice for 10 minutes. Supernatants containing the cytoplasmic fractions were
collected after centrifugation (2000 rpm, 4°C, 5 minutes). The pellets were washed three times
in lysis buffer A and then lysed in buffer B (HEPES pH 7.6 20 mM, 20% glycerol, 500 mM
NaCl, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 0.2 mM EDTA, 1 mM DTT, 0.1% NP40, and a proteinase inhibitor
cocktail (Roche)) for 30 minutes on ice. After centrifugation (13000 rpm, 4°C, 15 minutes),
the recovered supernatants containing the nuclear lysates were collected and frozen (−70°C)
until use. For Fig. 1a, the data are representative of two independent experiments each
performed on two different MEF preparations. For Fig. 1b, the data are representative of results
obtained from three independent cell lines.
Cell viability assay

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Cells were split into 96-well plates (3000 cells per well). 24 hours later, cells were infected
with the indicated retro- or lentiviruses, and 72 hours later cells were fixed in Methanol (10
minutes), dried 15 minutes, stained 10 minutes in Methylene blue dye (0.05% Methylene blue
in 1× borate buffer (borate buffer 10×, pH8.4, consists of 100 mM H3BO3, 25 mM Na2BO7,
120 mM NaCl)), washed three times under gentle tap water, and dried (2 hours, 37°C). 0.1 M
HCl was added for solubilization, after which cell viability was measured on a
spectrophotometer (O.D. 650 nm). Non-infected cell values were set to 1 (100% viability).
RNA purification, reverse transcription and real-time PCR amplification
RNA was purified using Trizol (Invitrogen), according to the manufacturer’s instructions. 1
µg RNA was reverse-transcribed using a High-Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription Kit
(Applied Biosystems). 10 ng cDNA was used for real-time PCR amplification, using
commercially available Taqman probes for mouse Gapdh, Tnf, Glut3, Ikba, Bcl2, Bclx, Xiap,
Il6 and Cxcl1 (Applied Biosystems). Data were normalized to the Gapdh levels, and analyzed
using the comparative CT method 30, except for Fig. 4d, where data are presented as fold
changes (2− ΔCT (rtTA+)/2− ΔCT (rtTA−); mean rtTA− set to 1).
NF-κB p65 DNA-binding activity assay

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

5 µg of nuclear extracts were used to determine p65 DNA-binding activity using an ELISAbased assay, according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Active Motif TransAM, #40096).
Briefly, κB oligonucleotide-coated plates (in a 96-well format) were incubated for 1 hour with
the nuclear extracts. Specificity was achieved through incubation with anti-p65 primary
antibodies for 1 hour. HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies were used for the detection of
p65 bound to the κB sequences.
Reagents
Mouse TNF (used at 50 ng/ml) was from Apotech. Antibodies to cleaved caspase-3 (#9661),
IKKβ (2C8) and PARP (46D11) were purchased from Cell Signaling. Antibodies to p65 (C-20),
c-Rel (C) and NEMO (FL-419) were purchased from Santa Cruz. Mouse anti-p53 was a kind
gift from K. Helin (Copenhagen, Denmark). Rabbit anti-Flag (F7425) antibodies, 4hydroxytamoxifen and doxycycline were purchased from Sigma.
Infection of MEFs
In Fig. 1a, primary MEFs (passage 2) of the indicated genotypes were infected with
adenoviruses (100 MOI) expressing Cre recombinase (AdCre) or FlpO recombinase (AdFlpO)

NF-κB activity depends on p53. (a) MEFs were infected with adenoviruses expressing Cre or
FlpO recombinase. 6 days later, cytoplasmic (c) and nuclear (n) lysates were analyzed by
western blot (WB). NEMO (cytoplasmic) and PARP (nuclear) were used to determine purity.
(b,c) K-rasLA2/WT; p53LSL/LSL; Cre-ERT2–lung tumor derived cells were either untreated (ctl),
cultured in 0.1% FBS or stimulated with 200 nM 4-hydroxytamoxifen (OHT). (b) 4 days later,
cells were lysed and analyzed as in (a). (c) 4 days later, RNA was purified, reverse transcribed,
and cDNA was amplified using probes for Glut3, Tnf or Gapdh (internal control). Data show
means +/− s.d. (n= 3 independent cell lines), presented as fold changes (treatment/control; see
Methods) 30.

NF-κB p65 DNA-binding activity is increased in NSCLC cells with altered p53. (a,b) 5 µg of
nuclear lysates of the indicated mouse (a) or human (b) cell lines were analyzed for p65 DNAbinding activity by an ELISA assay (see Methods). Cells harboring WT p53 are indicated. As
a positive control of p65 activity, LKR13 cells (a) were stimulated with TNF for 30 minutes
prior to lysis.

NF-κB inhibition results in apoptosis of p53-deficient lung adenocarcinoma cells. (a) Two WT
p53 (LKR10 and LKR13) and two K-rasLSL-G12D/WT; p53Flox/Flox (KP) mouse cell lines were
uninfected (No Lenti), infected with control (ctl) or IκB-SR expressing lentiviruses. 72 hours
later, cells were assayed for viability (see Methods). Data are means +/− s.d. (n=3) of cell
viability relative to uninfected cells (set to 1). (b) Lung cell lines or fibroblasts (3TZ) were
untreated (−) or infected with pSicoRev expressing a Nemo (sh1, 2) or ctl hairpin. 72 hours
later, cell extracts were analyzed by WB. *n.s., non-specific staining. (c,d) KP cells were
infected with pSicoRev expressing the indicated hairpin, or were uninfected (−). 72 hours later,
cells were assayed for viability (c), or cell extracts were analyzed by WB (d). (c) Data are
means +/− s.d. (n=6) of cell viability relative to uninfected cells (set to 1). *, P<0.05 relative
to ctl hairpin.

NF-κB inhibition impairs lung adenocarcinoma development. (a) K-rasLSL-G12D/WT;
p53Flox/Flox mice were infected with Lenti-Pgk.Cre or Lenti-UbC.IκB-SR; Pgk.Cre viruses,
sacrificed 17 (left) or 14 (right) weeks post-infection (w.p.i.) and tumor number was counted
(see Methods). (b–d) K-rasLSL-G12D/WT; p53Flox/Flox; CCSP-rtTA+ (rtTA+) or -rtTA− mice
(rtTA−) were infected with Lenti-TRE.IκB-SR; Pgk.Cre viruses (104 viral particles). (b) From
the day of infection, mice were fed a doxycycline diet (Dox). At 15 w.p.i., µ-CT imaged tumors
(magenta) and lungs were reconstructed and individual tumor volumes (mm3, white text) were
measured. (c) From 15 to 19 w.p.i., lungs were µ-CT imaged, and individual tumor volumes
were measured. Data points represent means of fold change +/− s.d. in tumor volume relative
