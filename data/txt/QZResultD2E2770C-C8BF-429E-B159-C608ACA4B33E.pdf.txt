Abstract
Decitabine, a cancer therapeutic that inhibits DNA methylation, produces variable antitumor response rates in patients
with solid tumors that might be leveraged clinically with
identiﬁcation of a predictive biomarker. In this study, we
proﬁled the response of human ovarian, melanoma, and breast
cancer cells treated with decitabine, ﬁnding that RAS/MEK/ERK
pathway activation and DNMT1 expression correlated with
cytotoxic activity. Further, we showed that KRAS genomic status
predicted decitabine sensitivity in low-grade and high-grade
serous ovarian cancer cells. Pretreatment with decitabine
decreased the cytotoxic activity of MEK inhibitors in KRASmutant ovarian cancer cells, with reciprocal downregulation of

DNMT1 and MEK/ERK phosphorylation. In parallel with these
responses, decitabine also upregulated the proapoptotic BCL-2
family member BNIP3, which is known to be regulated by MEK
and ERK, and heightened the activity of proapoptotic smallmolecule navitoclax, a BCL-2 family inhibitor. In a xenograft
model of KRAS-mutant ovarian cancer, combining decitabine
and navitoclax heightened antitumor activity beyond administration of either compound alone. Our results deﬁne the
RAS/MEK/DNMT1 pathway as a determinant of sensitivity to
DNA methyltransferase inhibition, speciﬁcally implicating
KRAS status as a biomarker of drug response in ovarian cancer.

Introduction

treatment may enhance this compound's clinical beneﬁt in
patients with solid tumors.
Small-molecule sensitivity proﬁling of deeply characterized
cancer cell lines is one approach to identify features that correlate
with compound activity (5–8). For example, proﬁling experiments clearly identify the enhanced sensitivity of BRAF-mutant
cells to BRAF inhibitors, and this association predicts response in
patient populations (6–8). To date, sensitivity-proﬁling experiments have relied on 3-day time points to measure viability.
However, small molecules that target chromatin-modifying proteins are reported to decrease cellular viability at extended time
points (9, 10). As such, longer time points may be more informative in studying dependencies targeted by chromatin-modifying agents, such as decitabine.
Here, we used a 9-day viability assay to demonstrate that a
subset of solid tumor cell lines is sensitive to low-dose decitabine
at clinically achievable concentrations. We showed that RAS/RAF/
MEK pathway activation as well as DNMT1 expression correlates
with sensitivity to decitabine. We demonstrated that mutation or
ampliﬁcation of KRAS predicts sensitivity to decitabine in ovarian
cancer cell lines. We further observed changes in activity of
navitoclax and MEK inhibitors following decitabine pretreatment
and showed that BCL-2 and MEK signaling may regulate decitabine's activity in RAS-activated cancer cell lines. Finally, we
showed that the combination of decitabine and navitoclax signiﬁcantly decreased tumor volume to a greater extent than either
agent alone in a cell line–derived xenograft model.

DNA methylation plays an active role in chromatin structure
and gene expression and thus can signiﬁcantly affect tumorigenicity (1–3). Decitabine is a cancer therapeutic that disrupts DNA
methylation through inhibition of DNA methyltranferases,
DNMT1, DNMT3A, and DNMT3B (3). Decitabine is approved
to treat hematologic malignancies and in this context provides
signiﬁcant therapeutic beneﬁt. Indeed, low-dose decitabine
induced an objective response in 73% of patients with myelodysplasic (n ¼ 77) and chronic myelomonocytic leukemia
(n ¼ 18; ref. 4). Although the best clinical response occurred in
patients who showed rapid hypomethylation in peripheral blood
and bone marrow cells, the degree of hypomethylation failed to
correlate with response (4).
In contrast to hematopoietic cancers, decitabine shows moderate to low response rates in patients with solid tumors. Treatment with low-dose decitabine in patients with female reproductive (n ¼ 35), melanoma (n ¼ 23), and breast (n ¼ 4) cancers
demonstrated a combined response and stable disease count of
6%, 26%, and 50%, respectively (2). Identifying stratiﬁcation
markers as well as optimal combination strategies for decitabine

was performed within 6 months of receiving the cell lines. The cell
lines were authenticated by BSP or ATCC via SNP array and shorttandem repeat proﬁling, respectively. Authentication of the cell
lines after purchasing was not performed. Mutation and gene
expression data for each cell line were obtained from the Cancer
Cell Line Encyclopedia (8). Antibodies were purchased from Cell
Signaling Technology. DNMT3B antibody was purchased from
Abcam. All compounds were dissolved in DMSO and stored at
20 C. For all 6- and 9-day treatments, media and compound
were replenished every 3 days.
Cell viability
Cell density was optimized in 384-well plates for 3- or 9-day
treatment independently using CellTiter-Glo (Promega) per the
manufacturer's instructions (30 mL). Cell density was optimized
such that cell growth for the duration of the treatment fell
within the linear range. For cotreatment combination studies,
cells were plated at a density of 250 cells per well in 96-well
plates (100 mL). Cells were plated and allowed to adhere for
24 hours prior to administering the compound. Cell viability
was measured using CellTiter-Glo (1:2 with PBS) per the
manufacturer's instructions. Luminescence was measured using
the Envision (Perkin Elmer). Background luminescence was
subtracted, and the measured ATP level was normalized to the
vehicle. For all 6- and 9-day treatments, media and compound
were replenished every 3 days.
Capase-3/7 activation
Cells were plated at a density of 250 cells per well in 96-well
plates and allowed to adhere for 24 hours prior to treatment. Cells
were treated for 6 days with decitabine. CellTiter Blue (Promega)
and Caspase Glo (Promega) were used in combination per the
manufacture's instructions. Fluorescence (560Ex/590Em nm) and
luminescence were measured using the SpectraMax M5 (Molecular Devices). Background luminescence was subtracted, and the
measured caspase activation was normalized to cell number. For
all 6-day treatments, media and compound were replenished
every 3 days.
Western blot analysis
Cells were lysed in RIPA buffer (Thermo) supplemented with
PhosphoStop (Roche) and complete protease inhibitor (Roche).
Lysate (50 mg) was loaded onto a NuPage Bis–Tris Gel (4%–12%;
Invitrogen) and transferred using the iBlot (Invitrogen). The
membrane was blocked (5% milk/PBS/0.1% Tween) and incubated with primary antibody (3% BSA/PBS/0.1% Tween) overnight at 4 C or at room temperature for 2 hours. The membrane
was washed three times (0.1% Tween/PBS) and incubated with
the appropriate secondary antibody (3% BSA/PBS/0.1% Tween).
Luminescence was captured after the addition of FemtoSubstrate
(Thermo) using the Image Station 4000 MM (Kodak) and
Carestream MI software at various exposure times. Quantiﬁcation of the Western blots was performed using ImageJ.
Pretreatment combination studies
Cells (0.1–0.25  106) were plated in 100-cm2 dishes. After
24 hours, cells were treated with decitabine (0.5 mmol/L) or
DMSO for 3, 6, or 9 days. Cell density was adjusted every 3 days
to prevent overgrowth, and the media and compound treatment
were replaced. Viable cells were harvested by trypsin and plated
(30 mL) in 384-well plates in the presence of decitabine or DMSO

at an optimized density and allowed to adhere for 24 hours.
Combination compounds (100 nL) were administered for 72
hours, and cell viability was measured as described (11). Viability
was normalized to the cell state tested, and the area under the
curve (AUC) was determined for treatment with decitabine
(AUCdectabine) or DMSO (AUCDMSO) as previously described
(6). Cell viability of decitabine or DMSO pretreated cells was
conﬁrmed by calcein AM staining.
Correlation analysis using differential mutual information

where x is the activity to decitabine proﬁle and y is each of the
genomic alterations or pathway proﬁles being compared against.
The computation is based on kernel density estimation following
a methodology similar to that used in Wood and colleagues but
normalizing the mutual information (12, 13) as to produce an

To assess the signiﬁcance of every Ic score, we perform a
permutation test randomly permuting the activity to decitabine
proﬁle and based on those scores compute nominal P values and
false discovery rates (FDR) as those shown in Supplementary
Tables S1 and S2.
Database of gene sets
The database of gene sets used in this study (7,762 gene sets)
consists of the Molecular Signatures Database (MSigDB, release
4.0, www.broadinstitute.org/msigdb) subcollections c2, c3, c5,
and c6 (14), plus a preliminary unpublished collection of oncogenic signatures that will be incorporated in subcollection c6 in a
forthcoming release of MSigDB.
Xenograft assay
Four- to 5-week-old female athymic Nude-Foxn1nu mice were
purchased from Harlan Laboratories and maintained in sterile
housing throughout the experimental period. For this subcutaneous
(s.c.) xenograft model, 5  106 OVCAR8 cells in 200 mL of a PBS/
Matrigel (BD Biosciences) mixture (1:1 v/v) were injected s.c. into
the right ﬂank of the mice. After the tumors reached approximately
200 mm3 in volume, mice were randomized and treated with
decitabine (0.2 mg/kg s.c. thrice weekly), navitoclax (100 mg/kg
i.p. ﬁve times per week), decitabine and navitoclax as described or
vehicle control (PBS) for 4 weeks before euthanasia and necropsy.
Week 4 treatment of the combination study omitted one injection
of decitabine and two injections of navitoclax in all cohorts. Groups
of 7 mice were used. Tumor volume was calculated weekly from
caliper measurements of the smallest (SD) and largest tumor
diameter (LD) using the formula: volume ¼ [LD  SD2]  p/6.
Experiments performed received prior approval from the Vanderbilt
University Institutional Animal Use and Care Committee, and all
animals were maintained in accordance with guidelines of the
American Association of Laboratory Animal Care.
Combined bisulﬁte restriction analysis
Cells were treated for 6 days with decitabine (0.5 mmol/L) or
DMSO. Cell lysis and bisulﬁte treatment was accomplished using
the EpiTect Plus LyseAll Lysis Kit and the EpiTect Plus Bisulﬁte Kit

by Qiagen as per the manufacturer's instructions. Combine bisulﬁte restriction analysis was performed as previously described
(15). Brieﬂy, PCR was carried out using HotStarTaq DNA polymerase (Qiagen) as per the manufacturer's instructions using
bisulﬁte-treated DNA (300 ng). Touchdown PCR was performed
using BNIP3 primers surrounding the transcriptional start site F:
50 -TTYGGTYGGAGGAATTTATAGGGTAG, R: 50 -CCCTCRCCCACCRCCAAAAC (where Y ¼ C or T and R ¼ A or G; temperature
cycle: 58–3, 56–4, 54–5, 52–26). The 156-bp PCR product (10 mL)
was digested with the restriction enzyme AfaI (Invitrogen) for
1 hour at 37 C, and the DNA was subjected to 2% agarose gel
electrophoresis and imaged.

Results
Decitabine decreases cell viability in a time-dependent manner
in a subset of solid tumor cell lines
To study the effects of compounds that lead to changes in
chromatin modiﬁcations, we used a 9-day viability assay. We
targeted two distinct chromatin modiﬁcations, DNA methylation
and histone deacetylation, using the FDA-approved small-molecule
therapeutics, decitabine and vorinostat, in an ovarian cancer cell
line (OVCAR8). Media and compound were replaced every 3 days
to minimize nutrient deprivation and compound degradation.
Although both compounds showed a dose-dependent decrease in
viability, decitabine showed a marked change in activity over time.
Speciﬁcally, activity improved approximately 1,000-fold from 3
days (IC50day 3, > 33.3 mmol/L) to 9 days of treatment (IC50day 9,
22.2 nmol/L). In contrast, treatment with vorinostat caused a stable
decrease in cell viability at all three time points (Fig. 1A).
To understand better decitabine's activity in solid tumors, we
proﬁled the response of 45 cancer cell lines in ovarian, melanoma,
and breast lineages over 9 days of treatment with decitabine. In
general, decitabine showed no activity at 3 days of treatment, but
signiﬁcantly decreased cell viability at 6 and 9 days of treatment
(Fig. 1B). A subset of cell lines in all three lineages showed substantial sensitivity to low doses of decitabine at 9 days of treatment
(IC50 < 150 nmol/L), and decitabine elicited a dynamic range in
sensitivity greater than 1,000-fold (10 nmol/L > IC50 > 10 mmol/L)
in all lineages after 9 days of treatment (Supplementary Fig. S1).
KRAS mutation status predicts decitabine sensitivity in ovarian
cancer cell lines
We correlated genomic alterations and pathway features to
decitabine sensitivity and resistance in an unbiased manner using
a differential mutual information estimator (see Materials and
Methods). We found that activating mutations in KRAS (P 1.88 
102) and NRAS (P 7.43  102), but not BRAF, strongly correlate
with sensitivity to decitabine. Ampliﬁcations in CRAF (P ¼ 7.65 
102), a downstream effector of RAS proteins, also correlated with
sensitivity. Seven of the 10 most sensitive cell lines contained
genomic alterations in KRAS or CRAF, and the most sensitive cell
lines were KRAS-mutant ovarian cancer cell lines (n ¼ 4; Fig. 2A
and Supplementary Table S1).
We also found that genomic alterations in genes associated with
the activation of p38 signaling correlated with resistance to decitabine. Speciﬁcally, ampliﬁcation of MAP2K6 (P ¼ 1.9  103),
which activates p38 signaling, and deletion of genes that inactivate
p38 signaling, such as USP47 (P ¼ 1.4  103) and DUSP26 (P ¼
1.0  103), correlated with resistance to decitabine (Supplementary Table S1). Activation of p38 signaling is reported to oppose
RAS-induced cancer cell proliferation (16, 17) and may represent a

www.aacrjournals.org

distinguishing feature of cancer cell lines that are resistant to
decitabine. To mitigate confounding variables, we analyzed doubling time for each cell line. Importantly, sensitivity to decitabine
failed to correlate with doubling time (Supplementary Fig. S2A).
Global gene-expression proﬁles available from the Cancer Cell
Line Encyclopedia (8) were analyzed to score the activity of gene
sets (see methods) that represent deﬁned pathways for each cell
line using single-sample Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (18).
These enrichment scores were correlated to decitabine sensitivity
using the differential mutual information estimator to identify
pathways implicated in the response to decitabine. Consistent
with their association to genomic alterations in RAS pathway
genes, sensitivity to decitabine also correlated with gene-set
signatures derived from overexpression of KRAS (KRAS.
Breast_HMLE.24_UP, P ¼ 2.46  103), CRAF (RAF_UP.V1_DN,
P ¼ 2.40  103) and MEK (MEK_UP.V1_DN, P ¼ 2.40  102;
Fig. 2B). High expression of genes in gene-set signatures corresponding to cell-cycle regulation (Mitotic_Cell_Cycle_Checkpoint, P ¼ 5.19  104, Cell_Cycle_Go_0007049, P ¼ 7.78 
104) also strongly correlated with sensitivity to decitabine (Supplementary Table S2).
Given the impact of RAS/RAF/MEK signaling on decitabine
activity, we hypothesized that KRAS genomic status may predict
sensitivity to decitabine in ovarian cancer. Clinically, KRAS mutations occur in approximately 30% of low-grade serous ovarian
cancers, and KRAS ampliﬁcations occur in approximately 11% of
high-grade serous ovarian cancers (19). We proﬁled an additional
low-grade KRAS-mutant (TP53 wild-type), two high-grade KRASmutant (TP53-mutant), and three high-grade KRAS-ampliﬁed
(TP53-mutant) serous ovarian cancer cell lines. Low-grade and
high-grade ovarian cancer cell lines that harbored mutations or
genomic ampliﬁcations in KRAS were highly sensitive to decitabine
(IC50 < 150 nmol/L) compared with KRAS wild-type ovarian
cancer cell lines (Fig. 2C). This sensitivity is consistent with
decitabine's activity in the previously proﬁled KRAS-mutant ovarian cancer cell lines. To extend these ﬁnding to other lineages, we
tested the activity of decitabine against a limited panel of pancreatic
and colon cancer cell lines. All four pancreatic cell lines tested
harbor a G12 mutation in KRAS and were sensitive to decitabine
after 9 days of treatment. The IC50 values for the pancreatic cell
lines PANC1, KP2, L33, and SNU213 were 267.2 nmol/L, 75.2
nmol/L, 61.29 nmol/L, and 15 nmol/L, respectively (Supplementary Fig. S2B). In contrast, KRAS mutation status failed to predict
sensitivity to decitabine in colon cancer; although two KRASmutant cell lines (HCT116, RCM) were sensitive to decitabine,
two (HCT15, LS513) displayed moderate sensitivity and one
(SNUC2A) was resistant (Supplementary Fig. S2C).
DNMT1 plays a role in mediating decitabine's activity in
cancer cell lines
Decitabine targets DNA methyltransferases DNMT1, DNMT3A,
and DNMT3B. Given the role of DNMT1 as a downstream effector
of RAS proteins (20, 21), we analyzed basal gene-expression levels
available from the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (8) and changes
in protein levels of DNA methyltransferases after treatment
with decitabine. Decitabine sensitivity correlated more strongly
with high expression of DNMT1 (r, 0.443) than DNMT3A
(r, 0.176) or DNMT3B (r, 0.187) as assessed by Pearson regression analysis (Fig. 3A and Supplementary Fig. S3A). In addition,
decitabine clearly decreased DNMT1 levels in three KRAS-mutant
ovarian cancer cell lines, OVCAR8, TOV21G, and OV56 (Fig. 3B

KRAS genomic status predicts decitabine sensitivity in ovarian cancer cell lines. A, correlation analysis based on differential mutual information was used to correlate
the cellular response of decitabine (9-day treatment) with genomic features of ovarian (blue), melanoma (green), and breast (orange) cancer cell lines. B,
correlation analysis based on differential mutual information was used to correlate the cellular response of decitabine (9-day treatment) with pathway features as
deﬁned by gene sets with high gene expression (red) or low gene expression (blue). C, cell viability after 9 days of treatment with decitabine are shown
for the proﬁled KRAS-mutant (black) and wild-type (gray) ovarian cancer cell lines. Cell viability was measured in one additional KRAS-mutant low-grade serous
ovarian cancer cell line (orange), two additional KRAS-mutant high-grade serous ovarian cancer cell lines (navy), and three additional KRAS-ampliﬁed
high-grade serous ovarian cancer cell lines (teal). Data are representative of two independent experiments (14 replicates; mean  SD).

Next, we measured the change in activity of a combination
"informer set" consisting of 38 small molecules with varying
mechanisms of action after pretreatment with low-dose decitabine (0.5 mmol/L) for 9 days followed by coadministration of
decitabine and the combination "informer set." Although the
majority of compounds responded in a similar manner, a number
of signiﬁcant changes in compound activity were observed upon
pretreatment with decitabine (Fig. 4B). Speciﬁcally, our data
conﬁrmed that decitabine pretreatment increased activity of
HDAC inhibitors in a number of solid tumor cell lines. In
addition, pretreatment with decitabine increased the activity of
the BCL-2 family inhibitor, navitoclax, and decreased activity of
MEK inhibitors, such as trametinib and selumetinib, and DNA
targeting agents (Fig. 4C). The decrease in activity of DNA-targeting agents, which require cell division to induce cell death, is

appropriate combination schedule, we measured the change in
activity of the histone deacetylase inhibitor vorinostat, a compound known to synergize with decitabine (23). The human
plasma maximum concentration (Cmax) value ranges from 0.3
to 1.6 mmol/L for low-dose decitabine treatment (24), and, thus, a
clinically meaningful concentration of decitabine (0.5 mmol/L)
was chosen for all combination experiments. For cotreatment
experiments, A375 cancer cells were treated for 3 days with
vorinostat and low-dose decitabine (0.5 mmol/L), and cell viability was measured. For pretreatment experiments, A375 cancer
cells were pretreated with low-dose decitabine (0.5 mmol/L) for 9
days and live cells, as veriﬁed by staining with calcein AM, were
treated with decitabine and vorinostat for 3 days. Pretreatment
with decitabine, but not cotreatment, increased activity of vorinostat (Fig. 4A).

Pretreatment with decitabine alters the activity of a subset of small-molecule probes. A, cell viability was measured after cotreatment with vorinostat and decitabine
for 3 days or after pretreatment with decitabine or DMSO for 9 days followed by cotreatment with vorinostat and decitabine for 3 days (two biological
replicates, mean  SD). B, thirty-four cancer cell lines were pretreated with decitabine (0.5 mmol/L) or DMSO for 9 days. Viable cells were harvested and cotreated
with decitabine (0.5 mmol/L) or DMSO and the combination "informer set." Cell viability was measured after 3 days and normalized to the cell state tested.
The AUC was determined for treatment with decitabine (AUCdecitabine, y-axis) or DMSO (AUCDMSO, x-axis). Data are the mean of two biological replicates. C, the
difference between AUCdecitabine and AUCDMSO was plotted for each cell line (x-axis) and each "informer set" compound (y-axis).

consistent with the reported observation that decitabine can
induce a quiescent cell population in certain contexts (25).
Importantly, the majority of compounds, including GDC-0941
(pan-PI3K inhibitor), bortezomib (proteasome inhibitor), and
NVP-TAE684 (ALK inhibitor), showed no change in activity after
pretreatment with decitabine despite showing activity as single
agents (Fig. 4C and Supplementary Fig. S4A). Together, our data
suggest that decitabine induces an altered cell state characterized
by decreased sensitivity to MEK inhibitors and increased sensitivity to HDAC and BCL-2 family inhibitors. We hypothesize that
MEK/ERK and BCL-2 family signaling may play a direct role in
mediating decitabine sensitivity.
Decitabine modulates sensitivity to MEK inhibitors in
KRAS-mutant ovarian cancer cell lines
We investigated the relationship between KRAS status and
changes in sensitivity to the MEK inhibitor trametinib after
pretreatment with decitabine. We observed that ovarian cancer
cell lines harboring a mutation in KRAS had a decreased response

2902 Cancer Res; 75(14) July 15, 2015

to trametinib after pretreatment with decitabine (Fig. 5A). We
assessed the time point at which pretreatment with decitabine
altered compound activity. We found that pretreatment with
decitabine for 3 days, followed by cotreatment with decitabine
and trametinib for 3 days, induced changes in compound sensitivity comparable to decitabine pretreatment for 9 days in a KRASmutant ovarian cancer cell line (MCAS) and a CRAF-ampliﬁed
melanoma cell line (A375; Fig. 5B and Supplementary Fig. S4B).
Re-activation of the MEK/ERK pathway as demonstrated by
phosphorylation of MEK and ERK has been shown to reduce
activity of MEK inhibitors (26). As such, we examined the effect of
decitabine treatment on phosphorylation of MEK and ERK.
Decitabine treatment for 6 days increased phosphorylation of
both MEK and ERK in a KRAS-mutant ovarian cancer cell line
(MCAS), but not a lineage-matched KRAS wild-type cell line
(RMGI; Fig. 5C and Supplementary Fig. S5A). Decitabine also
increased phosphorylation of MEK in OVCAR8, a high-grade
serous ovarian cancer cell line that harbors a mutation in KRAS
(Supplementary Fig. S5B).

and upregulation of BNIP3 may play a role in mediating decitabine sensitivity in KRAS-activated ovarian cancer cell lines and
provide a strong rationale for combining decitabine and navitoclax in this cancer context.
The combination of decitabine and navitoclax shows activity in
a xenograft model derived from a KRAS-mutant ovarian cancer
cell line
To extend these ﬁndings in vivo, we ﬁrst tested the response of a
KRAS-mutant ovarian cell line (OVCAR8) to decitabine as a single
agent in a murine xenograft model. We used a subcutaneous
OVCAR8 xenograft model, which displayed slower growth than
an intraperitoneal xenograft and allowed for extended treatment
with decitabine. Decitabine was administered at low doses as
previously reported for 4 weeks following initial tumor formation
(0.2 mg/kg s.c., 3 per week; ref. 30). Low-dose decitabine
displayed a moderate decrease in tumor volume (Fig. 7A) and
tumor mass (Supplementary Fig. S6A). No overt toxicities were
observed.
We next tested the effect of coadministration of decitabine
and navitoclax in a murine xenograft model using OVCAR8.
Decitabine (0.2 mg/kg s.c., 3 per week) and navitoclax (100
mg/kg i.p., 5 per week) were administered alone or in combination for 4 weeks following initial tumor formation. The
combination of decitabine and navitoclax signiﬁcantly reduced
tumor volume (Fig. 7B) and tumor mass (Supplementary
Fig. S6B) compared with either agent alone. No overt toxicities
were observed.

Discussion
Decitabine modulates sensitivity to the BCL-2 family inhibitor,
navitoclax, in KRAS-mutant ovarian cancer cell lines
We conﬁrmed that pretreatment with decitabine increases
sensitivity to the BCL-2 family inhibitor navitoclax. Speciﬁcally,
we observed that pretreatment with decitabine for 3 days followed
by cotreatment with decitabine and navitoclax for 3 days
increased activity of navitoclax in a KRAS-mutant ovarian cancer
cell line (MCAS; Fig. 6A). In an effort to simplify dosing and
scheduling, we assessed the effect of cotreatment with decitabine
and navitoclax. Cotreatment with decitabine increased activity of
navitoclax in MCAS and OVCAR8 cell lines (Fig. 6B and Supplementary Fig. S5C). Interestingly, decitabine cotreatment (Fig. 6B),
but not pretreatment (Fig. 4C), increased sensitivity to navitoclax
in OVCAR8, a high-grade serous ovarian cancer.
Activation of the MEK/ERK pathway has previously been
shown to increase expression of the BCL-2 family proapoptotic
protein, BNIP3 (27–29). Consistent with this report, we found
that decitabine treatment for 6 days increased expression of BNIP3
in MCAS and OVCAR8, KRAS-mutant ovarian cancer cell lines,
but not in RMGI, a KRAS wild-type ovarian cancer cell line after
treatment for 6 days (Fig. 6C). In addition, decitabine treatment
for 6 days decreased methylation at the transcriptional start site of
BNIP3 in MCAS (Supplementary Fig. S5D). Given the role of
BNIP3 as a proapoptotic BCL-2 family member, we measured
activation of caspase-3 and -7 as a marker for apoptosis after
decitabine treatment for 6 days. Decitabine induced a dosedependent increase in caspase activation at time points corresponding to decreased cell viability in both MCAS and OVCAR8
(Fig. 6D). Together, these data suggest that MEK/ERK activation

We proﬁled a panel of 45 solid tumor cell lines in ovarian,
melanoma, and breast cancer lineages for their response to
decitabine over a 9-day period. We demonstrated that decitabine
shows pronounced time-dependent activity in a subset of solid
tumor cancer cell lines. For example, activity of decitabine in
OVCAR8, an ovarian cancer cell line, improved approximately
1,000-fold from 3 days of treatment (IC50day 3, > 33.3 mmol/L) to 9
days of treatment (IC50day 9, 22.2 nmol/L). Overall, decitabine
demonstrated activity at low doses (IC50 < 150 nmol/L) in a subset
of solid tumor-derived cancer cell lines and elicited a large
dynamic range in sensitivity (10 nmol/L > IC50 > 10 mmol/L) in
all lineages. In contrast, a panel of hematopoietic cell lines
showed a similar range of sensitivities to decitabine after 3 days
of treatment (data not published). The maximum concentration
(Cmax) of decitabine achieved in human plasma in response to
low-dose decitabine treatment is 0.3 to 1.6 mmol/L (24). Given
the sensitivity of a subset of solid tumors to decitabine (IC50 < 150
nmol/L), these data suggest that a prolonged, low-dose treatment
regimen may beneﬁt patients with some solid tumors.
To understand if decitabine's activity was stronger in certain
cancer contexts, we correlated compound sensitivity to cell-line
features. The absence of confounding correlations to lineage or
doubling time enabled us to conduct an unbiased search for
genomic features and activated pathways that are associated with
sensitivity to decitabine. Genomic alterations in KRAS, NRAS, and
CRAF as well as activation of the RAS/RAF/MEK pathway significantly correlated with sensitivity to decitabine. In addition, cellcycle regulation correlated with sensitivity to decitabine. This
pathway was previously shown to associate strongly with KRAS
activation (30, 31).

Decitabine modulates activity of the BCL-2 family inhibitor navitoclax. A, KRAS-mutant ovarian cancer cell line, MCAS, was pretreated with decitabine for 3 days,
followed by cotreatment with decitabine and navitoclax for 3 days (two biological replicates; mean  SD). Data were normalized to the ATP levels (CTG)
measured for the corresponding DMSO- or decitabine-treated controls (6 days). Data are representative of two independent experiments. B, KRAS-mutant
ovarian cancer cell lines, MCAS and OVCAR8, were cotreated with decitabine and navitoclax for 6 days (two biological replicates; mean  SD). Data were
normalized to the ATP levels (CTG) measured for the corresponding DMSO- or decitabine-treated controls (6 days). Data are representative of two independent
experiments. C, BNIP3 was probed by Western blot after treatment with decitabine for 6 days in KRAS-mutant (MCAS and OVCAR8) and KRAS wild-type
(RMGI) ovarian cancer cell lines. D, caspase-3 and -7 activation was measured after 3, 6, and 9 days of treatment in KRAS-mutant ovarian cancer cell lines (six
replicates; mean  SD). Data are representative of two independent experiments.

Given the correlation of RAS/RAF/MEK pathway activation and
decitabine activity, we tested the ability of KRAS genomic status to
predict sensitivity to decitabine in vitro. KRAS mutations occur in
30% of low-grade serous ovarian cancers, and genomic ampliﬁcations of KRAS occur in 11% of high-grade serous ovarian cancer
tumors (32). Six additional KRAS-mutant and -ampliﬁed ovarian
cancer cell lines representing low- and high-grade serous ovarian
cancer lines showed sensitivity to decitabine at low dose (IC50 < 150
nmol/L). These data suggest that KRAS genomic status may serve as
a potential biomarker for sensitivity to decitabine in ovarian cancer.
RAS/RAF/MEK signaling is reported to regulate DNMT1 and
DNMT1-dependent DNA methylation (20–22, 33). Speciﬁcally,
overexpression of RAS has been shown to increase DNMT1
protein levels (28), and inhibition of MEK by siRNA or smallmolecule inhibitors decreased expression of DNMT1 (22). In
accordance with our observation that decitabine sensitivity associated with RAS pathway activation, we observed that high gene
expression of DNMT1, but not other DNA methyltransferases,
correlated with sensitivity to decitabine. We further showed that
inhibition of RAS/RAF/MEK signaling with the MEK inhibitor
selumetinib decreased DNMT1 levels in KRAS-mutant ovarian
cancer cell lines. The observed data align with the reported
RAS-DNMT1 signaling pathway and imply that targeting DNA
methyltransferases in RAS-activated cancers may be a useful
therapeutic strategy.
The activity of compounds in the presence or absence of
decitabine may provide mechanistic insight into the impact of

2904 Cancer Res; 75(14) July 15, 2015

KRAS signaling on decitabine activity. For example, the combination of decitabine and vorinostat are reported to induce synergistic activity attributed to the combined disruption of chromatin marks (23). This combination has provided a platform for
clinical translation (23, 34, 35). We performed compound proﬁling in 34 solid tumor–derived cell lines with varying sensitivities to decitabine. Given our observation that pretreatment with
decitabine altered the activity of vorinostat, we proﬁled the
response of 38 small molecules after pretreatment with decitabine
for nine days. We observed that decitabine altered the activity of
select compounds targeting a subset of biological pathways,
including RAS/RAF/MEK signaling and BCL-2 family proteins.
Interestingly, decitabine substantially decreased activity of
MEK inhibitors in KRAS-mutant ovarian cancers. Re-activation
of the MEK/ERK pathway has been implicated in resistance to
BRAF and MEK inhibitors (26) and may account for the altered
activity of MEK inhibitors. Indeed, decitabine activated the MEK/
ERK pathway, as indicated by increased phosphorylation of MEK
and ERK. Previous studies show that activation of the MEK/ERK
pathway increases proapoptotic BCL-2 family members, such as
BNIP3 (27–29). The increased expression of this proapoptotic
BCL-2 protein may contribute to the increased activity of the
BCL-2 family inhibitor navitoclax after pretreatment with decitabine. Consistent with these ﬁndings, we found that treatment with
decitabine increased BNIP3 protein levels in two KRAS-mutant
ovarian cancer cell lines and activated caspase-3 and -7 at time
points corresponding to a reduction in cell viability. Together,

these data suggest that upregulation of the MEK/ERK pathway and
proapoptotic BCL-2 family proteins by decitabine contributes to
reduced viability in RAS-activated cell lines and provides a rationale for the combination of decitabine and navitoclax in KRASmutant ovarian cancers.
We extended the observed cellular activity of decitabine and
navitoclax to an in vivo xenograft model using a KRAS-mutant
ovarian cancer cell line. We demonstrated that cotreatment with
decitabine and navitoclax dramatically decreased tumor volume
compared with administration of either agent alone. Further
studies using multiple KRAS-mutant and KRAS wild-type ovarian
cancer cell lines in diverse in vivo settings are necessary to account
fully for the effect of tumor heterogeneity and genotype heterogeneity on the efﬁcacy of decitabine.
Precision medicine aspires to match cancer therapeutics to
patients most likely to beneﬁt from the treatment. We have shown
that RAS/RAF/MEK pathway activation correlates with sensitivity
to decitabine, a small molecule traditionally used in hematologic
cancers that may also have beneﬁt in solid tumors. Cell-line and
compound proﬁling revealed a direct role of RAS/MEK/DNMT1
signaling and the BCL-2 family of proteins in mediating sensitivity
to decitabine. We showed that KRAS mutations or ampliﬁcations
predicted sensitivity to decitabine in ovarian cancer cell lines and
suggest a potential biomarker for patient stratiﬁcation. Further
studies are necessary to test the therapeutic beneﬁt of these
strategies in preclinical models and ultimately in patients.
