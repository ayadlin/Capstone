ABSTRACT
Glioblastoma multiforme is the most common primary malignant brain tumor in
adults. In addition to poor response to treatment, a high recurrence rate contributes to
the poor prognosis. The purpose of this study was to investigate the genetical and clinical
characteristics of recurrent glioblastoma. We used whole transcriptome sequencing data
to examine the distribution of molecular subtypes and gene signatures in 22 recurrent
glioblastoma taken from the Chinese population, and further analyzed biological
progression of the tumors, when compared with primary glioblastoma. The proportion of
the classical subtype in recurrent ones (22%) was lower than that in primary glioblastoma
(36%). The frequency of IDH1 mutations in recurrent glioblastomas was nearly twice
that in primary glioblastomas. TP53 mutations were fewer in proneural recurrent
glioblastomas (20%) but frequent in classical recurrent glioblastomas (80%). The most
common sites of recurrent glioblastomas were the temporal lobe (41%). In patients
diagnosed with recurrent glioblastoma multiforme, 64% were younger than 50 years.
Gene set enrichment analysis revealed that chromatin fracture, repair, and remodeling
genes were enriched in recurrent glioblastoma. Our results highlight the differences in
clinical features, molecular subtypes and gene alterations between primary and recurrent
glioblastoma and may be helpful for targeted therapy for recurrent glioblastoma.

no satisfactory improvement in overall survival has been
achieved [16]. In addition to a high rate of recurrence,
the appearance of new genetic mutations and malignant
phenotypes in the process of recurrence increases the
difficulty of treatment for recurrent GBM [17, 18]. A
comprehensive portrait of the genetic alterations, age
distribution, tumor localization and other clinical features
in primary and recurrent GBM is needed to better classify
tumor profiles. This could lead to an understanding of the
characteristics of recurrent GBM, and suggest potential
targets for personalized therapeutic strategies.
In the present study, we investigated the characteristics
of primary and recurrent GBM, with the goal of developing
targeted and individualized treatment for GBM. We used
whole transcriptome sequencing to assess 110 samples,
including 88 primary GBM and 22 recurrent GBM, with
defined molecular subtypes (proneural, neural, classical and
mesenchymal). We analyzed the distribution of genetic events
and examined the clinical features between the subtypes. We

INTRODUCTION
Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most
common and malignant primary brain tumor in adults.
Despite advancing treatments including resection,
radiotherapy and chemotherapy, most patients survive
less than one year [1–4]. Numerous patient-specific factors
result in a poor response to treatment, including the tumor
acquiring resistance to treatment, tumor heterogeneity,
and restricted delivery of treatments to the central nervous
system as a consequence of both the blood–brain barrier
and the high interstitial peritumoral pressures [5, 6].
The high recurrence rate found in patients with GBM
is a major clinical challenge. Previous clinical trials
have evaluated combination therapy for the treatment of
recurrent GBM, and these are better than monotherapies
[7–15]. Despite some minor improvements in progressionfree survival (PFS) of recurrent GBM by the introduction
of temozolomide (TMZ) and other targeted treatments,

found that primary and recurrent GBM showed differences
in mutation point distribution and clinical features. Gene set
enrichment analysis (GSEA) indicated that the two types
of GBM were enriched in different gene sets. Our findings
provide a comprehensive portrait of gene alterations, clinical
features and gene set enrichment in primary and recurrent
GBM, which could be helpful in determining the direction of
potential targeted drug therapy.

18% in recurrent GBM. TP53 mutation exhibited a slightly
higher frequence in (59%) recurrent GBM than that of
primary GBM (50%). EGFR mutations were detected in 26%
of primary GBM, and in 18% of recurrent GBM. (Table 1)
Among proneural subtypes, both primary and
recurrent GBM showed a high frequency of IDH1
mutations. TP53 mutations were detected in 5 of 13
proneural primary GBM but in only 1 out of 5 proneural
recurrent GBM. Such mutations were also present in 14
of 32 (44%) classical primary GBM, but were even more
prevalent in classical recurrent GBM (80%).
In the mesenchymal subtype, TP53, EGFR and ATRX
mutations were detected in 20 (56%), 10 (28%) and 3 (8%)
out of 36 mesenchymal primary GBM respectively, and 70%,
10% and 30% of 10 mesenchymal recurrent glioblastomas.

RESULTS
Distribution of molecular subtypes in primary
and recurrent GBM
As shown in Figure 1, 36% of 88 primary GBM
belonged to the classical subtype. This was higher than
the proportion of this subtype in recurrent GBM (22%).
However, the proportion of the proneural subtype in primary
GBM (15%) was lower than in recurrent GBM (23%).
Samples identified as being of the neural subtype made up 8%
of primary GBM and 9% of recurrent GBM. Approximately
half of primary and recurrent GBM were identified as the
mesenchymal subtype (41% and 45%, respectively).

Clinical feature of primary and recurrent GBM
GBM predominantly affected males; the male
to female ratio was 1.67 in primary GBM and 1.75 in
recurrent GBM (Figure 2A and Table 2). With respect to
anatomic localization, the frontal and temporal lobes were
the most common sites of primary GBM, accounting for
33% and 34%, respectively (Figure 2B). However, only
9% of recurrent GBM were located in the frontal lobe,
which was significantly lower than that of recurrent GBM
(P < 0.05). The most common sites of recurrent GBM were
the temporal lobe (41%) and other lobes (excluding the
frontal and temporal lobes, 41%, Figure 2C). Among the
88 patients with primary GBM, 39 patients were younger

Investigation of gene alterations in primary and
recurrent GBM
IDH1 mutations were found in 12 out of 88 primary
GBM (14%) and 6 of 22 recurrent GBM (27%). The
frequency of ATRX mutations in primary GBM was 10%, and

age or older (Figure 2B). Among the 22 patients with
recurrent GBM, 14 patients were younger than 50 years
and 8 patients were 50 years of age or older (Figure 2C).
The mean age of patients diagnosed with primary GBM
was 49.61 ± 1.346 years, and with recurrent GBM, the

targets for therapy is urgently. To date, the distinction
between primary and recurrent GBM has not been
systematically investigated. In the present study, 88 primary
and 22 recurrent GBM were investigated using whole
transcriptome sequencing combined with analysis of clinical
data. When the 110 tumors were divided into molecular
subtypes, we found that the proportion of proneural subtype
was more frequent in recurrent GBM than that of primary
GBM, while the classical subtype showed an opposite
result. The incidence of neural and mesenchymal subtypes
between primary and recurrent GBM remained similar.
These results suggest that the proneural subtype was more
likely to recurrent when compared to the other molecular
subtypes. The classical subtype exhibited the opposite
pattern of incidence.
The frequency of IDH1 mutations in recurrent GBM
was nearly twice that of primary GBM, and distribution
of this group of mutations was particularly high in the
proneural subtype. TP53 mutations were more likely to
be found in classical and mesenchymal recurrent GBM
than in primary GBM. However, such mutations were rare
in proneural recurrent GBM. The phenomena of variable
distribution of molecular subtypes and gene signatures
between primary and recurrent GBM suggests that these
genetic events might play important roles in the recurrent
progression of primary GBM. For example, classical and
mesenchymal primary GBM exhibiting TP53 mutation
had a high risk of recurrence, whereas proneural primary
GBM carrying TP53 mutation were less likely to relapse.
The ratio of male to female incidence of primary
and recurrent GBM was approximately the same,
demonstrating that there was no difference in recurrence
of GBM depending on gender. With respect to anatomic
localization, 33% of primary GBM were located in frontal
lobe, whereas only 9% of recurrent GBM were found
there. Conversely, other lobes, especially temporal lobe,
were more common sites for recurrent GBM than primary
GBM. These findings suggest that tumors in frontal
lobe had a low recurrent rate. There was no significant
difference in mean age between primary and recurrent
GBM. However, when we used 50-year-old as a boundary
line to divided into 2 groups, less than 50 and more than or
equal to 50, we found that 64% of patients with recurrent

Our results indicate that gene sets related to TRANSLATION
(P < 0.001), RNA_PROCESSING (P = 0.024) and
CELLULAR_BIOSYNTHETIC_PROCESS (P = 0.016)
were signif­icantly enriched in the primary GBM, while DNA_

Supplementary Table S1).

DISCUSSION
Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most
common and aggressive malignant primary brain tumor in
adults. Despite treatment involving chemotherapy, radiation
and surgery, GBM exhibits a median survival rate of 15
months [3, 4, 19]. An important factor in the poor prognosis
of primary GBM is a high recurrence rate [20]. Currently,
treatments for recurrent GBM mainly involve repeated
resection, further chemotherapy and focal irradiation [21,
22]. With the accumulation of knowledge regarding the
molecular and genetic profile of GBM, some molecularly
targeted therapies, such as growth factor inhibitors or TMZ,
have led to some progress in treatment [3, 16]. However,
despite these advances in treatment strategies, the majority
of patients suffered recurrent GBM, with a subsequent
median survival of approximately 6 months [23–26].
Therefore, insight into the differences between primary
and recurrent glioblastoma from a molecular and clinical
perspective, and exploration of more effective molecular

GBM were younger than 50 years old, compared with 44%
of primary GBM. Because there is no difference in age
between primary and recurrent GBM in the whole cohort,
we cannot conclude that people younger than 50 years old
have a higher tendency towards recurrence. However, the
results above suggest that the recurrence rate of primary
GBM does not increase with age.
Aimed for finding the enriched gene sets among
the differentially expressed genes between primary and
recurrent tumors, GSEA was performed for primary and
recurrent GBM in this study. Enriched gene sets related to
TRANSLATION, RNA_PROCESSING and CELLULAR_
BIOSYNTHETIC_PROCESS were found in primary GBM.
These are related to protection and progression of primary
GBM, while DNA_DAMAGE_RESPONSESIGNAL_
TRANSDUCTION, DNA_DAMAGE_CHECKPOINT
and CHROMOSOME_SEGREGATION gene sets relating
to recurrence of tumor cells were enriched in recurrent
GBM. Compared to primary GBM, recurrent tumors
displayed significant biological progression, including DNA
damage repair, cell metabolic process and other rebuilt
procession of recurrent tumor cells. This was consistent
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

with the clinical progression of recurrent GBM relapsed
from the residual cancer cells after treatments.
Our study comprehensively characterizes the
distinction in molecular subtypes, gene signatures and
clinical features between primary and recurrent GBM.
Although past efforts have not significantly improved
the prognosis of recurrent GBM, increasing insight into
primary and recurrent GBM can help us to enhance timely
intervention and reduce the recurrence rate of GBM, as
well as improving molecularly targeted therapies.

Whole transcriptome sequencing was performed
as described previously [28]. Briefly, total RNA was
isolated from homogenized frozen tissue samples
using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen) according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. RNA purity was checked
using a 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies) and only
high quality samples with an RNA Integrity Number (RIN)
value greater than or equal to 7.0 were used to construct
the sequencing library. The subsequent sequencing steps
included end repair, adapter ligation, size selection and
polymerase chain reaction enrichment. The length of DNA
fragment was measured using a 2100 Bioanalyzer, with a
median insert size of 200 nucleotides. The libraries were
sequenced on the Illumina HiSeq 2000 platform using
the 101-bp pair-end sequencing strategy. Short sequence
reads were aligned to the human reference genome (Hg
19 Refseq) using the Burrows-Wheeler Aligner (BWA,
Version 0.6.2-r126). SnpEff software was used to annotate
genetic variance [29].
