Abstract
Breast and ovarian cancer patients harboring BRCA1/2
germline mutations have clinically beneﬁtted from therapy
with PARP inhibitor (PARPi) or platinum compounds, but
acquired resistance limits clinical impact. In this study, we
investigated the impact of mutations on BRCA1 isoform
expression and therapeutic response. Cancer cell lines and
tumors harboring mutations in exon 11 of BRCA1 express a
BRCA1-D11q splice variant lacking the majority of exon 11.
The introduction of frameshift mutations to exon 11 resulted
in nonsense-mediated mRNA decay of full-length, but not the
BRCA1-D11q isoform. CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing as well as

overexpression experiments revealed that the BRCA1-D11q
protein was capable of promoting partial PARPi and cisplatin
resistance relative to full-length BRCA1, both in vitro and in
vivo. Furthermore, spliceosome inhibitors reduced BRCA1D11q levels and sensitized cells carrying exon 11 mutations
to PARPi treatment. Taken together, our results provided
evidence that cancer cells employ a strategy to remove deleterious germline BRCA1 mutations through alternative mRNA
splicing, giving rise to isoforms that retain residual activity and
contribute to therapeutic resistance. Cancer Res; 76(9); 2778–90.

BRCA1-D11q and Therapy Resistance

Introduction
Germline mutations in the BRCA1 gene are associated with
an increased risk of developing breast and ovarian cancer (1, 2).
Mutations often result in reading frameshifts and nonsensemediated mRNA decay (NMD; ref. 3). The BRCA1 protein is
essential for efﬁcient homologous recombination (HR)-mediated repair of double-stranded DNA breaks (4, 5). Inhibitors of
PARP, as well as platinum agents, induce double-stranded DNA
breaks that are repaired by the HR DNA repair pathway (6, 7).
Consequently, cells that have defective HR DNA repair,
such as those with dysfunctional BRCA1 or BRCA2 proteins,
are highly sensitive to PARP inhibitor (PARPi) or platinum
treatments (8–11).
Although PARP inhibitors have been shown to provide survival
improvements, many patients that harbor germline BRCA1 or
BRCA2 mutations do not gain beneﬁt from PARPi therapy
(12–14). In addition, many patients that ﬁrst beneﬁt from either
PARPi or platinum therapy develop disease progression and resistance (15). PARPi or platinum resistance has been demonstrated to
arise by a variety of mechanisms, including reversion mutations
(16, 17), loss of 53BP1 pathway activity (18, 19), expression of
hypomorphic BRCA1 proteins (20, 21), and drug efﬂux (22).
BRCA1 mRNA isoforms generated by alternative splicing lack
speciﬁc exons and have been shown to be expressed in cells and
tissues (23–25). In particular, the relative levels of BRCA1 exon
11 splice isoforms differ between normal and cancer tissues and
in discrete phases of the cell cycle (26–29). These isoforms
include BRCA1 full-length (inclusion of all coding exons), D11
(skipping of exon 11), and D11q (partial skipping of exon 11).
The BRCA1-D11q isoform derives from use of an alternative
exon 11 splice donor site, resulting in the exclusion of most
exon 11 nucleotides (c.788-4096; Supplementary Fig. S1;
refs. 27, 28). In human cells and tissues, the BRCA1- D11q
isoform expression is more readily detectable than the BRCA1D11 isoform (26, 29, 30).
The BRCA1-D11 isoform has previously been implicated in
both cell death and proliferation in mouse studies. Both Brca1null and Brca1D11/D11 mice that exclusively express Brca1-D11
undergo embryonic lethality, but Brca1D11/D11 embryos die at a
later stage, suggesting that Brca1-D11 isoform can partially compensate for the lack of other Brca1 isoforms during embryogenesis
(31–33). BRCA1 mutations located in exon 11 represent approximately 30% of the overall number of mutation carriers that
develop breast and ovarian cancer in the United States
(34–37). Here, we examined the impact of exon 11 mutations
on BRCA1 isoform expression and therapy response.

Materials and Methods
Cell lines and reagents
Cells were purchased from Asterand or ATCC. Cycloheximide
(CHX), actinomycin D (ACT), puromycin, blasticidin, and DMSO
were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, cisplatin was from APP/
Fresenius Kabai USA LLC, and paclitaxel from Sagent Pharmaceuticals. Pladienolide B (Pl-B) was purchased from Calbiochem.
Clovis Oncology provided rucaparib (CO-338) and olaparib
(AZD2281) was purchased from Selleckchem. BRCA1-mutated
cell lines were validated through DNA sequencing and the identiﬁcation of speciﬁc BRCA1 mutations that are uniquely present in
individual cell lines as well as DNA ﬁngerprinting. Cell lines tested
negative for mycoplasma.

Colony formation assays
Depending on colony-forming potential, cells were seeded at
a density ranging from 500 to 4,000 cells per well in 6-well
plates in the presence of increasing concentrations of either
rucaparib or olaparib. For cisplatin and taxol treatments, exponentially growing cells were cultured in 24-well plates, treated
with increasing concentrations of cisplatin and taxol for 24
hours, and replated in 6-well plates for colony formation. For
shRNA or cDNA add back colony formation experiments, cells
were treated as above, but with the addition of either puromycin or blastcitidin in the media. For siRNA treatments,
exponentially growing cells were reverse transfected in 24-well
plates, and 2 days after transfection, cells were treated with
rucaparib for 72 hours and then replated in 6-well plates for
colony formation. For Pl-B colony assays, cells were treated
with Pl-B (1.25 nmol/L) and rucaparib (100 nmol/L) for 72
hours and then replated into 6-well plates for colony formation. Colony formation was assessed 2 weeks postplating with
crystal violet staining. Mean colony formation from three
experiments was expressed as percentage of colonies  SE
relative to vehicle-treated cells.
Gene sequencing and RT-PCR analysis
Genomic DNA was isolated from cells using the DNeasy
tissue kit (Qiagen). To determine whether gene rearrangements
had taken place that would have excluded the exon 11q region
from genomic DNA of cell lines and patient-derived xenograft
(PDX) tumors, we carried out PCR using OneTaq Hot Start 2X
Master Mix (NEB) and gDNA as templates. Primers were located in exon 10 (forward, F) and 12 (reverse, R): F:aatcacccctcaaggaacca; R:ctcacacccagatgctgcttc. Total RNA was isolated
from cell lines using RNeasy Kit (Qiagen). For quantitative
RT-PCR, RNA was tested for quality on a Bioanalyzer (Agilent).
RNA concentrations were determined with a spectrophotometer (NanoDrop; Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc). RNA was reverse
transcribed using Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Ambion) and a mixture of anchored oligo-dT and
random decamers. Two reverse transcription reactions were
performed for each sample using either 100 or 25 ng of input
RNA. Assays were used in combination with TaqMan Universal
Master mix or Power SybrGreen Master Mix and run on a 7900
HT sequence detection system (Applied Biosystems). Cycling
conditions were 95 C, 15 minutes, followed by 40 (two-step)
cycles (95 C, 15 seconds; 60 C, 60 seconds). Ct (cycle threshold) values were converted to quantities (in arbitrary units)
using a standard curve (four points, 4-fold dilutions) established with a calibrator sample. For each sample, the values
were averaged and SD of data derived from two independent
PCRs. For the BRCA1 splice variants, amplicons quantiﬁed
by on-chip electrophoresis on an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer
were used for absolute quantiﬁcation assays. Primers that
speciﬁcally recognize the following BRCA1 mRNA isoforms
were used: exon þ11 containing: F:tagcaaggagccaacataacagat;
R:cttattccattcttttctctcacacag; D11q: F:gattctgcaaaaaaggctgct; R:
cagatgctgcttcaccctga.
For RBFOX2 F:aagcccagtagttggagctgt, R:ttgcctagggacacatctgctt;
and POLR2F: F:tgccatgaaggaactcaagg R: tcatagctcccatctggcag.
BRCA1 expression values were routinely normalized to a POL2RF
housekeeping gene (HKG) control and expressed as a percentage
of the values calculated for MDA-MB-231 cells or to a relevant
control sample.

BRCA1-minigene generation and analysis
Genomic DNA derived from blood lymphocytes of healthy
individuals was tested for the absence of mutations by BROCA
sequencing. The entire genomic region of BRCA1 from exon 8 to
exon 12 was ampliﬁed with the following 5 PCR reactions and
primer sets:

HA-tag was cloned into pENTRA vector using SalI and XhoI
sites. Each BRCA1 fragment was ﬁrst cloned into pENTRA-HA
vector using XhoI (shown in lowercase forward primers above)
and EcoRV (shown in lowercase reverse primers above) sites. The 5
cloned fragments were assembled into a minigene using the
following restriction sites that corresponded with cut sites in each
fragment: EcoRI, SpeI, StuI, and ScaI sites. An eGFP fragment was
cloned into the 30 end of the exon 12 fragment using EcoRV site.
The minigene was then shuttled into pcDNA6.2 Destination
vector using the LR Clonase system (Invitrogen). We conﬁrmed
by Sanger sequencing that mutations were not introduced into
exons or introns within 500 bp ﬂanking each exon. The indicated
mutations (see Supplementary Fig. S3A) were introduced using
site-directed mutagenesis (Agilent) using the following primers:

To measure BRCA1-D11q-reporter expression, total RNA was
isolated from transfected cells using RNeasy Kit (Qiagen). cDNA
was synthesized using High-Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription
Kit (Applied Biosystems). PCR was performed using OneTaq Hot
Start 2X Master Mix (NEB). Primers that speciﬁcally recognize
BRCA1-D11q-reporter mRNA were: F: gattctgcaaaaaaggctgct; R:

Western blotting
Western blotting was carried out as described previously and
proteins detected using the following antibodies: BRCA1: Nterminal: (MS110, EMD), C-terminal: (D9, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), BRCA1 (9010, Cell Signaling Technology), tubulin

(2148, Cell Signaling Technology), HA (23675, Cell Signaling
Technology), RAD51 (H-92, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), Pol II [C18, (Santa Cruz Biotechnology)], CtIP (A300-438-A, Bethyl Laboratories), PALB2 (A301-247A1, Bethyl Laboratories), BARD1
(A300-263A, Bethyl Laboratories), and BRCA2 (OP-95, EMD).
HA (23675, Cell Signaling Technology) antibody was used for
immunoprecipitation of HA-BRCA1 complexes from 2 mg of
nuclear extract using Pierce Classic IP Kit (Thermo Scientiﬁc)
according to the manufacturer's instructions. Nuclear extracts
were derived using NE-PER Nuclear and Cytoplasmic Extraction
Reagents (Thermo Scientiﬁc) according to the manufacturer's
instructions. Densitometric analyses were carried out using
ImageJ software.
Immunoﬂuorescence and microscopy
For immunoﬂuorescence HA (HA.11, Covance), BRCA1
(MS110, EMD), g-H2AX (pS139; N1-4131, EMD) and RAD51
(H-92, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), geminin (10802-1-AP, ProteinTech Group) and geminin (Abnova, E7071-1A8) antibodies
were followed by secondary antibodies conjugated to FITC or
Texas Red (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories). We acquired
immunoﬂuorescence images using Nikon NIU Upright Fluorescent Microscope and generated images using Nikon NIS Elements
software. For IR experiments, we routinely ﬁxed cells 8 hours after
treatment with 10 Gy. For analyses, we counted a minimum of
200 cells per condition or cell line. Foci-positive cells were
expressed as a percentage of geminin-positive cells to account for
any differences in S–G2–M populations between cell lines. Each
experiment was carried out three times with biologic replicates.
g-H2AX IRIF was present equally in all cell lines and routinely
measured as a positive control for IRIF.
Immunoﬂuorescence and immunohistochemical analyses of
tumors
For BRCA1 focus formation analysis, tissue sections were
deparafﬁnized with xylene and hydrated with decreasing concentrations of ethanol. For target antigen retrieval, sections
were microwaved in Dako Antigen Retrieval Buffer pH 9.0 for
4 minutes at 110 C [a T/T MEGA multifunctional Microwave
Histoprocessor (Milestone)]. Sections were cooled down in
distilled water for 5 minutes, and then permeabilized with
Dako Wash Buffer containing Tween 20 for 5 minutes, followed
by incubation in blocking buffer (Dako Wash Buffer with 1%
BSA) for 5 minutes. Primary antibodies were diluted in Dako
Antibody Diluent and incubated at room temperature for 1
hour [anti-BRCA1 Abcam MS110 diluted 1:200; anti-Geminin
(ProteinTech Group, 10802-1-AP, diluted 1:400)]. Sections
were washed for 5 minutes in Dako Wash Buffer followed by
5 minutes in blocking buffer. Secondary antibodies (Alexa
Fluor 488 or 568) were diluted 1:500 in blocking buffer and
incubated for 30 minutes at room temperature. The two-step
washing was repeated followed by 5 minutes incubation in
distilled water. Dehydration was performed with increasing
concentrations of ethanol. Sections were mounted with DAPI
ProLong Gold antifade reagent and stored at 20 C. For
analyses, tumors from 2 mice per treatment group were analyzed and counted. For each tumor, a minimum of 100 geminin-positive cells were identiﬁed and counted for those that had
at least 5 BRCA1 foci. BRCA1 foci–positive cells were calculated
as a percentage of geminin-positive cells.

BRCA1-D11q and Therapy Resistance

For assessment of Ki-67 and g-H2AX by IHC, slides were
deparafﬁnized and hydrated. Antigen retrieval was performed
using pH 9 EDTA buffer (DAKO, S2368). Endogenous peroxidases were quenched by immersion of slides in 3% hydrogen
peroxide solution (30% H2O2, Fisher BP2633-500, diluted in
methanol). Primary antibody Ki-67 (Clone EP5), Epitomics,
(1:1,500), or g-H2AX (pS139; N1-4131, EMD; 1,20,000) were
diluted with DaVinci Green Diluant (Biocare Medical, PD900)
and incubated on slides overnight at 4 degrees in a humidiﬁed
slide chamber. Slides were then washed 3 times in TBST and
incubated with Envisionþ System HRP Labelled Polymer AntiRabbit (Dako, K4003) for 1 hour at room temperature. Specimens
were washed 3 times in TBST and then developed with DAB
solution (Dako, K3468) and counterstained in Meyer Hematoxylin (Dako, S3309). For analyses of Ki67 and g-H2AX expression,
a minimum of 2 tumors derived from 2 separate mice were used.
Mice were treated with rucaparib 150 mg/kg two times per day for
4 continuous days. For cisplatin, mice were treated with a single
dose of 6 mg/kg. Tumors were resected and formalin ﬁxed 4 days
from the ﬁrst dose. A minimum of 2 tumors and 3 images per
tumor were used to calculate staining intensities. Image staining
intensities were measured using ImageJ analysis software.
PDX tumor derivation, xenograft treatments, and analyses
For PDXs, patient consent for tumor use in animals was
completed under a protocol approved by the Vall d'Hebron
Hospital Clinical Investigation Ethical Committee and Animal
Use Committee. Mice were maintained and treated in accordance
with institutional guidelines of Vall d'Hebron University Hospital
Care and Use Committee. Tumors were subcutaneously
implanted in 6-week-old female HsdCpb:NMRI-Foxn1nu mice
(Harlan Laboratories). Animals were supplemented with 1
mmol/L estradiol (Sigma) in the drinking water. Upon xenograft
growth, tumor tissue was reimplanted into recipient mice, which
were randomized upon implant growth. Mice were allocated in
control/treated groups to deliver similar mean and SE when
tumor volume reached between 150 and 300 mm3 without any
blinding. Vehicle or olaparib was administered at 50 mg/kg per
oral gavage 6 days per week. Tumor xenografts were measured
with calipers and tumor volumes were determined using the
formula: (length  width2). At the end of the experiment, animals
were killed by CO2 inhalation. Tumor volumes are plotted as
mean  SEM. Relative tumor volume RTV for vehicle-treated mice
and individual RTVs are shown for olaparib-treated mice. For
xenograft studies, MDA-MB-436 cells were subcutaneously
implanted in 6-week-old female NSG mice (NOD.Cg-Prkdcscid
Il2rgtm1Wjl/SzJ). When tumors reached approximately 300 mm3,
tumors were harvested and cut up into smaller pieces followed by
subcutaneous reimplantation. Treatment was initiated when
tumors reached between 150 and 180 mm3. Rucaparib was
administered at 150 mg/kg twice daily for 10 continuous days
with a 2-day break after the ﬁrst 5 days. Cisplatin was administered at a single dose of 6 mg/kg. Tumors were measured with
calipers and tumor volumes calculated as described above. Measurements were carried out every 2 days and mice were euthanized
when tumors reached 1,500 mm3 in accordance with institutional
guidelines of Fox Chase Cancer Center (Philadelphia, PA).
Statistical analyses
Mean and SE values were compared using unpaired t tests
(GraphPad Software). P < 0.05 was considered statistically sig-

niﬁcant. Asterisks indicate statistically signiﬁcant P values. There
were similar variances between statistical groups compared. All
statistical tests were unpaired t tests unless otherwise stated next to
the P value.

Results
Cell lines with exon 11 mutations express BRCA1-D11q
To examine the impact of BRCA1 exon 11 mutations on the
expression of BRCA1 proteins, we employed a panel of human
cancer cell lines that were either BRCA1 wild-type or harbored
known deleterious BRCA1 mutations (Supplementary Fig. S2A).
Full-length BRCA1 protein was detectable in MDA-MB-231,
MCF7, and MDA-MB-468 wild-type BRCA1 cell lines, but was
absent in all BRCA1 mutation–containing cell lines. A band
corresponding with the predicted molecular weight (89 kDa)
of the BRCA1-D11q isoform was present in BRCA1 wild-type cell
lines, as well as L56Br-C1, SUM149PT, and UWB1.289 cell lines
that harbored BRCA1 exon 11 frameshift mutations (Fig. 1A).
To establish the identity of the isoform detected below the 100kDa mark, we transfected cells with a siRNA designed to specifically target BRCA1-D11q and measured protein expression.
BRCA1-D11q siRNA did not impact the levels of the full-length,
but dramatically reduced the expression of the predicted BRCA1D11q isoform (Fig. 1B). Furthermore, we conﬁrmed that cells did
not harbor secondary BRCA1 reversion mutations or genomic
rearrangements (Supplementary Fig. S2).
Next, we investigated the levels of BRCA1 mRNA containing
exon 11 (þ11) as well as the BRCA1-D11q (D11q) isoform
expression. L56Br-C1, SUM149PT, and UWB1.289 exon 11–
mutant cell lines exhibited 3- (P < 0.001), 3- (P < 0.001), and
2.9-fold (P < 0.001) lower expression of þ11 transcripts, respectively, relative to MDA-MB-231 cells (Fig. 1C). In contrast, relative
D11q expression was 1.46- (P ¼ 0.0148), 1.55- (P < 0.001), and
1.58-fold (P ¼ 0.0136) higher in L56Br-C1, SUM149PT, and
UWB1.289, respectively, relative to MDA-MB-231 cells expression
levels (Fig. 1C).
Robust BRCA1 gene transcription promotes BRCA1-D11q
expression
To investigate the impact of germline mutations on exon 11
splicing, we introduced a series of exon 11 frameshift mutations
into a BRCA1-minigene system (Supplementary Fig. S3). Mutation of the exon 11q splice junction disrupted D11q-reporter
mRNA and protein expression. However, three different frameshift mutations at various locations throughout exon 11 had no
effect on D11q-reporter expression (Fig. 1D). Moreover, RNA-seq
analyses of mRNA splice junctions did not indicate that higher
levels of BRCA1-D11q expression in cell lines with exon 11
mutations were due to increased global alterations in splicing
(Supplementary Table S1).
To further investigate the effects of exon 11 mutations on
BRCA1-D11q levels, we used CRISPR/Cas9 technology to generate
SUM149PT cells that either had additional out of frame mutations, or reversion mutations that restored the reading frame
(Supplementary Fig. S4). In line with minigene data, the introduction of additional out-of-frame or frame-restoring mutations
in exon 11 did not affect BRCA1-D11q expression (Fig. 1E).
However, clones 3 and 4 that had restored BRCA1 reading frames,
expressing the BRCA1-long-form protein product, had 2.5- (P <
0.0001) and 2.47-fold (P < 0.0001) increased levels of þ11

expression, respectively, relative to sg_GFP control cells (Fig. 1E),
likely resulting from premature translation termination codon
(PTC) removal, enabling þ11 containing transcripts to avoid
NMD (3).
We conﬁrmed that NMD contributed to the low levels of þ11
mRNA detected in exon 11 mutation containing cell lines by
treating cells with CHX, an inhibitor of NMD (Fig. 1F; ref. 38).
CHX treatment for 5 hours resulted in a 2.8- (P ¼ 0.0007), 3.2(P ¼ 0.023), and 2.9-fold (P ¼ 0.0024) increase in þ11 levels in
L56Br-C1, SUM149PT, and UWB1.289 exon 11–mutant cell lines,
respectively, but did not affect þ11 levels in wild-type MDA-MB231 cells, or D11q mRNA levels in any of the cell lines (Fig. 1F).
The increase in þ11 mRNA resulting from inhibition of
NMD led us to predict that exon 11–mutant cell lines have robust
BRCA1 gene transcription. To test this possibility, we treated

2782 Cancer Res; 76(9) May 1, 2016

cells with the transcription inhibitor ACT and measured BRCA1
mRNA levels. MDA-MB-231 cells treated with ACT had a 1.4-fold
(P ¼ 0.0002) reduction in þ11 mRNA levels compared with
vehicle-treated cells. However, ACT treatment reduced þ11 levels
3-fold (P ¼ 0.0133) in SUM149PT cells compared with vehicletreated cells, and completely abrogated the CHX-mediated
increase in þ11 mRNA (Fig. 1G). ACT also reduced D11q levels
1.6-fold (P ¼ 0.002) and 2-fold (P ¼ 0.021) in MDA-MB-231 and
SUM149PT cells, respectively, compared with vehicle treatments
(Fig. 1H).

sensitivity. SUM1315MO2, HCC1395, and MDA-MB-436 cell
lines were also more sensitive to cisplatin treatment compared
with L56Br-C1, SUM149PT, and UWB1.289 cells. The presence of
BRCA1 exon 11 mutations did not impact taxol sensitivity (Fig.
2B; Supplementary Table S2).
In cell growth experiments, BRCA1 wild-type cells continuously
cultured in the presence of PARPi or cisplatin proliferated at the
same rate as vehicle-treated cells (Fig. 2C). Exon 11–mutant cell
lines proliferated at a reduced rate in the presence of PARPi or
cisplatin (Fig. 2C). MDA-MB-436 and HCC1395 cell lines harbor
BRCT domain mutations and lost viability in the presence of
PARPi or cisplatin. PARPi and cisplatin initially had a greater
impact on the proliferation rate of UWB1.289 cells, but over time
proliferation gradually increased, and corresponded with
increased expression of BRCA1-D11q (Fig. 2D). Importantly,
depletion of the BRCA1-D11q using 2 BRCA1 shRNAs reduced

RAD51 IRIF 6.8- (P ¼ 0.0021) and 5.7-fold (P ¼ 0.0027) in
SUM149PT, as well as 6- (P ¼ 0.0014) and 4.7-fold (P ¼ 0.0016)
in UWB1.289 cells, compared with nontarget (NT) shRNA cells
(Fig. 2E). Furthermore, BRCA1 shRNA sensitized SUM149PT and
UWB1.289 cells to both PARPi and cisplatin treatments (Fig. 2F;
Supplementary Table S2).
BRCA1-D11q is functional but inferior to BRCA1 full-length
To more ﬁnely assess the ability of BRCA1-D11q to provide
resistance to therapy, we used CRISPR/Cas9–mediated gene editing to modify BRCA1 in SUM149PT cells (Supplementary Fig. S4).
SUM149PT cells were subject to an sg_GFP control, or sg_exon11
targeting the mutation-containing region of exon 11. Mutations
introduced by sg_exon11 were either out of frame (out-frame) or
restored the BRCA1 reading frame (in-frame). Moreover, cell lines
that expressed sg_exon22 demonstrated frameshift mutations in

BRCA1-D11q provides partial resistance to therapy in vitro. A, CRISPR/Cas9 gene targeting the SUM149PT BRCA1 mutation-containing region of exon 11 (sg_exon11)
did not affect the reading frame (OF) in clones 1, 2, or restored the reading frame (IF) in clones 3, 4. Targeting of exon 22 (sg_exon22) resulted in frameshift
mutations and loss of BRCA1 expression. Cells treated with sg_GFP were used as a control. BRCA1 protein was detected by Western blot analysis. See Supplementary
Fig. S4 for more details. B, cells described in A were treated with rucaparib or cisplatin and colony formation assessed. C, MDA-MB-436 cells expressing

cells were counted and expressed as a percentage of total geminin-positive cells; bars show mean  SEM of gemininþBRCA1 or RAD51 foci-positive cells

exons 22, resulting in loss of BRCA1-D11q expression (Fig. 3A and
Supplementary Fig. S4). BRCA1-D11q expression in sg_exon11–
treated clones with unrestored reading frames was identical to
sg_GFP control cells and there were no differences in PARPi and
cisplatin sensitivity in colony formation assays. However,
sg_exon11 in-frame clone 3 was 226- (P ¼ 0.0174) and 3.7-fold
(P ¼ 0.0009) more resistant to PARPi and cisplatin, respectively,
and clone 4 was 207- (P < 0.0001) and 3.6-fold (P ¼ 0.0058) more
resistant to PARPi and cisplatin, respectively, compared with
sg_GFP cells. In contrast, sg_exon22 cells were 31.4- (P ¼
0.0183) and 2.3-fold (P ¼ 0.0059) more sensitive to PARPi and
cisplatin, respectively, compared with sg_GFP cells (Fig. 3B).
We also compared the ability of ectopic BRCA1 full-length and
BRCA1-D11q to rescue PARPi and cisplatin sensitivity (Fig. 3C).
MDA-MB-436 cells harbor a BRCA15396þ1G>A mutation that
results in protein misfolding, undetectable BRCA1 protein and
RAD51 IRIF, as well as exquisite PARPi and cisplatin sensitivity
(20, 39, 40). MDA-MB-436 cells expressing BRCA1 full-length
demonstrated robust rescue and were 179- (P ¼ 0.0063) and 4.6fold (P ¼ 0.0002) more resistant to PARPi and cisplatin, respectively, compared with mCherry control cells. BRCA1-D11q was
less effective at rescue, and cells were 19- (P ¼ 0.0493) and 2.8fold (P ¼ 0.0004) more resistant to PARPi and cisplatin, respectively, compared with mCherry control cells (Fig. 3D). Moreover,
when we introduced an L304P mutation (equivalent to L1407P in
full-length BRCA1) that blocks the BRCA1-PALB2 interaction
(41), BRCA1-D11q–mediated PARPi and cisplatin rescue was
abolished (Fig. 3D).
Both BRCA1 full-length and BRCA1-D11q–expressing cells
formed BRCA1 and RAD51 IRIF. However, BRCA1-D11q expressing cells exhibited 1.9- (P ¼ 0.0053) and 1.9-fold (P ¼ 0.0141)
lower levels of BRCA1 and RAD51 IRIF, respectively, than fulllength BRCA1-expressing cells, while BRCA1-D11qþ L304P–
expressing cells had undetectable BRCA1 and RAD51 IRIF (Fig.
3E). Immunoprecipitation of ectopic BRCA1 from MDA-MB-436
cells suggested that BRCA1-D11q interacted, although less efﬁciently, with functional protein partners for full-length BRCA1
(Fig. 3F). We also demonstrated ectopic BRCA1-D11q provided

therapy resistance in HCC1395 cells and in a mouse embryonic
stem cell system (Supplementary Fig. S5; ref. 42).
BRCA1-D11q promotes resistance in vivo
To examine the signiﬁcance of BRCA1-D11q expression in
tumors, we ﬁrst measured PARPi responsiveness and BRCA1
isoform expression in two individual BRCA1 exon 11–mutant
PDX models. Despite both PDX models harboring the same
BRCA1-exon 11 2080delA mutation (Supplementary Fig. S2),
PDX124 tumors were sensitive and PDX196 tumors were resistant
to olaparib treatment (Fig. 4A). We conﬁrmed that tumors did not
have reversion mutations or gene rearrangements (Supplementary Fig. S2). Similar to exon 11–mutant cell lines, both PDX124
and PDX196 expressed higher levels of D11q compared with þ11
mRNA, relative to MDA-MB-231 control cells. However, BRCA1
mRNA levels were signiﬁcantly greater in PDX196 tumors than in
PDX124 tumors, with 26- (P ¼ 0.0001) and 23-fold (P < 0.0001)
higher levels of both þ11 and D11q, respectively (Fig. 4B).
BRCA1-D11q protein expression was detectable in olaparib-resistant PDX196 tumors, as well as PDX124 tumors that eventually
grew through olaparib treatment (Fig. 4C). BRCA1 foci formation
was also readily detectable in PDX196 tumors (Fig. 4D).
To further assess the impact of BRCA1-D11q on therapy resistance in vivo, we utilized the MDA-MB-436 isogenic cell line panel
for xenograft experiments. At 30 days post tumor implantation,
rucaparib or cisplatin treatment delayed mean tumor growth 6.8(P < 0.0001) and 12.9-fold (P < 0.0001), respectively, compared
with vehicle-treated mice with mCherry-overexpressing MDAMB-436 tumors. In contrast, rucaparib and cisplatin treatment
delayed mean tumor growth 1.1-fold (P ¼ 0.4455) and 1.28-fold
(P ¼ 0.2537) in BRCA1 wild-type and 1.4-fold (P ¼ 0.0872) and
2.3-fold (P ¼ 0.019) in BRCA1-D11q–overexpressing tumors,
respectively, compared with vehicle-treated mice (Fig. 4E and F).
Kaplan–Meier analyses indicated that the median overall survival (OS) of mice harboring mCherry-expressing tumors that
were treated with rucaparib or cisplatin increased 1.7-fold (P ¼
0.0016, log-rank test) and 2-fold (P ¼ 0.0016, log-rank test),
respectively, compared with vehicle treated mice. In contrast, in

mice harboring BRCA1 wild-type tumors that were treated with
rucaparib or cisplatin, median OS increased 1.3-fold (P ¼ 0.0071,
log-rank test) and 1.4-fold (P ¼ 0.0048, log-rank test), respectively, and in mice harboring BRCA1-D11q tumors treated with

log-rank test) and 1.5-fold (P ¼ 0.0333, log-rank test), respectively, compared with vehicle-treated mice (Fig. 4G).
Short-term assessment of pharmacodynamics markers showed
that rucaparib increased g-H2AX positivity similarly in all tumors,
but wild-type and BRCA1-D11q tumors had 4.5- (P < 0.0001) and
2.2-fold (P ¼ 0.005) lower g-H2AX positivity, respectively, after
cisplatin treatment compared with mCherry-expressing tumors.
In addition, wild-type and BRCA1-D11q tumors treated with
rucaparib had 2.2- (P ¼ 0.0007) and 2.5-fold (P ¼ 0.0059) higher
Ki67 positivity, respectively; and tumors treated with cisplatin had
2.6- (P < 0.0001) and 3.7-fold (P ¼ 0.0003) higher Ki67 positivity,
respectively, compared with mCherry-expressing tumors (Fig.
4G). In contrast to in vitro data, the degree of PARPi or cisplatin
rescue afforded by BRCA1-D11q overexpression was more similar
to BRCA1 full-length in vivo.
Assessment of BRCA1 exon 11 mutations and patient survival
Because exon 11–mutant tumors were capable of expressing
BRCA1-D11q, we assessed survival outcomes of patients with
frameshift mutations located inside (IE11) versus outside (OE11)
of exon 11. We analyzed 5-year OS data from the time of initial
diagnosis in patients with serous ovarian carcinoma from a
previously reported study (43). Here, participants with BRCA1
frameshift mutations OE11 (n ¼ 231, 43%; 95% CI, 36%–49%)
presented better OS than noncarriers (n ¼ 1,333, 33%; 95% CI,
30%–36%; P ¼ 0.002, log-rank test) as well as participants with
frameshift mutations IE11 (n ¼ 148, 31%; 95% CI, 23%–39%;
P ¼ 0.02, log-rank test) at 5 years of follow up. Moreover,
participants with frameshift mutations IE11 presented with 5year OS similar to noncarriers (P ¼ 0.84, log-rank test; Fig. 5A,
Supplementary Tables S3 and S4).
Although patients with exon 11 mutations demonstrated worse
5-year survival, we hypothesized that, similar to our PDX data,
BRCA1-D11q might only be highly expressed in a fraction of exon
11–mutant tumors, and so not all exon 11–mutant patients
would necessarily be resistant to therapy. Analyses of primary
tumors (unrelated to the above studies) with mutations IE11
showed variable levels of BRCA1-D11q expression. Tumor #317
expressed 2.7- (P ¼ 0.0227) and 4-fold (P ¼ 0.0117) greater levels
of D11q compared with tumor #325 and tumor #411, respectively, despite all tumors harboring deleterious exon 11 mutations
(Fig. 5B).
Inhibition of splicing increases PARPi sensitivity
Because high levels of BRCA1-D11q expression were required
for residual function, we hypothesized that limiting splicingdependent excision of exon 11q might provide an opportunity
to enhance PARPi sensitivity. We ﬁrst identiﬁed two binding
elements for the FOX2 splicing site selection factor at position
þ18 and þ63 downstream from the cryptic splice site location
(Supplementary Fig. S6; refs. 44, 45). Depletion of FOX2 using 2
individual siRNAs did not impact þ11 expression levels,
but reduced D11q expression 1.7- (P ¼ 0.0043) and 1.6-fold
(P ¼ 0.0179) in MDA-MB-231, 1.5- (P ¼ 0.048) and 1.6-fold
(P ¼ 0.0301) in UWB1.289, 2.2- (P ¼ 0.0056) and 3.1-fold
(P ¼ 0.0017) in SUM149PT cells, compared with scrambled

2788 Cancer Res; 76(9) May 1, 2016

siRNA–treated cells, respectively (Fig. 6A). At the protein level,
densitometric analyses of Western blots indicated FOX2 siRNA
did not impact full-length BRCA1 protein expression, but BRCA1D11q levels were reduced 2.9- and 2.2-fold in MDA-MB-231, 2and 2.8-fold in UWB1.289, 1.9- and 1.8-fold in SUM149PT cells,
compared with scrambled siRNA–treated cells (Fig. 6B). FOX2
siRNA had no impact on MDA-MB-231 cells PARPi sensitivity, but
reduced the LC50 value of rucaparib 3.8- (P ¼ 0.0063) and 27.4fold (P ¼ 0.0017) in UWB1.289 cells, as well as 1.9- (P ¼ 0.0237)
and 5-fold (P ¼ 0.0002) in SUM149PT cells, compared with
scrambled siRNA–treated cells (Fig. 6C). Furthermore, BRCA1minigene analyses demonstrated that mutation of FOX2-binding
motifs also partially decreased D11q-reporter mRNA and protein
levels (Fig. 6D).
We next investigated the ability of Pl-B, a small-molecule inhibitor of the U2 snRNP spliceosome machinery (46), to disrupt
BRCA1-D11q production. Pl-B treatment reduced both þ11 and
D11q mRNA expression; however, the relative reduction in D11q
levels was 7.7- (P ¼ 0.002) and 7-fold (P ¼ 0.016) greater
compared with the reduction in þ11 levels in MDA-MB-231 and
UWB1.289 cells, respectively (Fig. 6E). Furthermore, full-length
BRCA1 protein levels were reduced but remained readily detectable
after treatment with up to 10 nmol/L Pl-B in MDA-MB-231 cells.
However, BRCA1-D11q protein levels were barely detectable at
1.25 nmol/L Pl-B in both MDA-MB-231 and UWB1.289 cells (Fig.
6F). Simultaneous incubation with both Pl-B and rucaparib did
not signiﬁcantly impact MDA-MB-231 cells, but resulted in a 2.8(P ¼ 0.0296) and 2.1-fold (P ¼ 0.0426) reduction in colony
formation compared with cells treated with rucaparib only in
UWB1.289 and SUM149PT cells, respectively (Fig. 6G). Furthermore, ectopic overexpression of a BRCA1-D11q cDNA that did not
depend on exon 11q splicing, resulted in a 1.9-fold (P ¼ 0.001)
rescue in colony formation in cells treated with the Pl-B and
rucaparib combination, compared with GFP-expressing control
cells (Fig. 6H), suggesting that Pl-B–induced PARPi sensitization
was mediated, in part, through the reduction in BRCA1-D11q levels.

Discussion
In the current study, we provide evidence that BRCA1 splice
isoforms lacking exon 11 are capable of producing truncated but
hypomorphic proteins. It was previously shown that the exon 11–
deﬁcient Brca1-D11 isoform partially compensates for the lack of
other Brca1 isoforms during embryogenesis (31–33, 47). Here, we
show that BRCA1-D11q can also partially compensate for fulllength BRCA1 in response to homologous recombination targeting therapeutics. BRCA1-D11q retains, although less efﬁciently,
many of the protein–protein interactions carried out by full-length
BRCA1. We identiﬁed the BRCA1–D11q–PALB2 interaction as
critical for BRCA1-D11q–mediated RAD51 IRIF and resistance.
BRCA1-D11q was expressed in BRCA1 wild-type as well as exon
11–mutant cell lines. Although frameshift mutations in exon 11
resulted in the NMD of exon 11 containing transcripts, they did
not impact the rate of alternative splicing or directly affect BRCA1D11q levels. In support of this, PDX124 and PDX196 tumors both
harbored identical 2080delA exon 11 mutations; however, both
þ11 and D11q transcript levels were signiﬁcantly higher in
PDX196 relative to PDX124 tumors, suggesting that overall

responsiveness to olaparib therapy; while PDX124 was derived
prior to the patient starting olaparib therapy, PDX196 was derived
at the time of clinical tumor progression on olaparib. We anticipate that high levels of BRCA1-D11q expression may be selected
for in response to chemotherapy. Primary patient tumors harboring exon 11 mutations also demonstrated variable BRCA1-D11q
levels, and this isoform might only be overexpressed in a subset of
exon 11 mutation carriers. Additional resistance mechanisms
such as secondary reversion mutations have also been shown to
occur in tumors with exon 11 mutations (48, 49).
Intriguingly, our analyses indicated that exon 11 mutation
carriers with ovarian cancer had a worse 5-year overall survival
compared with non-exon 11 mutation carriers (Fig. 5A). Another
recent study of mutation-speciﬁc cancer risks identiﬁed the exon
11 region of BRCA1 as an ovarian cancer cluster region, where
mutation carriers had a relative decrease in breast relative to
ovarian cancer risk (50). Further work is required to determine
whether BRCA1-D11q has any impact on long-term survival
outcomes or breast versus ovarian tissue–speciﬁc phenotypes.
Currently, an understanding of PARPi and platinum resistance
is incomplete. Our ﬁndings provide evidence for a role of the
BRCA1-D11q alternative splice isoform in promoting resistance.
Moreover, we show that inhibition of the spliceosome reduced
BRCA1-D11q levels and sensitized exon 11–mutant cell lines to
PARPi, potentially offering a strategy to resensitize tumors that
express high levels of BRCA1-D11q.
