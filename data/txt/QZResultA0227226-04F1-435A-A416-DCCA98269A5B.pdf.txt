cardiomyopathy. Even at this dose limit, the incidence of
doxorubicin-induced heart failure is still high (6). A subpopulation
of children who received anthracycline therapy in a dose of >300
mg/m2, the risk for developing heart failure was 10% (7).
The mechanisms of doxorubicin-induced cardiomyopathy are
not fully understood, but a solid body of evidence indicates that
oxidative stress and cardiac inflammation are involved (6). We and
others showed previously that both attenuated cardiac cytokine
activation and lipid peroxidation activity might contribute to
improved left ventricular (LV) function in a mouse model of
doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity (8, 9).
3-Hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme (HMG-CoA-reductase)
inhibitors, also known as statins, are very effective in patients
with lipid disorders and atherosclerosis (10). However, in addition,
it is their anti-inflammatory and antioxidative pleiotropic effects
which, independent of their lipid lowering potential, are relevant
beneficial mechanisms of this drug class (11). For example, we
previously showed in a diabetic animal model, a chronic treatment
with statin using a dose too low to alter the lipid profile, led to
attenuation of vascular damage, which was contributed by a
reduction of inflammation and oxidative stress (12). Because
doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity has been shown to be sufficiently triggered by cardiac oxidative stress and inflammation, we
investigated whether or not statin pretreatment can produce
cardioprotective effects in a mouse model of doxorubicin-induced
cardiomyopathy (10).

Abstract
Cardiotoxicity, which may result from intense cardiac oxidative stress and inflammation, is the main limiting factor of the
anticancer therapy using doxorubicin. Because statins might
exert beneficial pleiotropic cardiovascular effects, among
other things, by anti-inflammatory and antioxidative mechanisms, we investigated whether or not fluvastatin pretreatment can attenuate doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity. Five
days after a single injection of doxorubicin (20 mg/kg; i.p.),
left ventricular (LV) function was measured in fluvastatintreated (DoxStatin; 100 mg/kg/day, p.o.) and saline-treated
(doxorubicin) mice (n = 8 per group) by a micro conductance
catheter. Untreated mice served as controls (placebo; n = 8 per
group). After measurement of cardiac function, LV tissues
were analyzed by molecular biological and immunohistologic
methods. Injection resulted in significantly impaired LV
function (LV pressure, 29%; dp/dtmax, 45%; cardiac
output, 68%; P < 0.05) when compared with placebo. This
was associated with a significant increase in cardiac oxidative
stress, inflammation and apoptotic mechanisms, as indicated
by significant increased cardiac lipid peroxidation activity,
protein expression of nitrotyrosine, tumor necrosis factor A
and Bax (P < 0.05). In contrast, DoxStatin mice showed
improved LV function (LV pressure, +24%; dp/dtmax, +87%;
cardiac output, +87%; P < 0.05) when compared with
untreated doxorubicin mice. This was associated with reduced
cardiac expression of nitrotyrosine, enhanced expression of
the mitochondrial located antioxidative SOD 2, attenuated
mitochondrial apoptotic pathways, and reduced cardiac
inflammatory response. Statin pretreatment attenuates doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity via antioxidative and antiinflammatory effects. [Cancer Res 2009;69(2):695–9]

Materials and Methods
Surgical procedures. Eight- to 10-wk-old C57BL/10 mice were randomly
divided into three groups (n = 6 per group). Two groups received
doxorubicin (Doxo Cell; Cell Pharm; 20 mg/kg; i.p.) at a dose that had been
shown to be cardiotoxic (13), and 1 group received saline (i.p.). Four days
before doxorubicin application, in one doxorubicin group, a treatment with
fluvastatin (100 mg/kg/day, p.o.; DoxStatin) was started. The other
doxorubicin group received saline (doxorubicin). The third group without
doxorubicin application received no further treatement (placebo). Five days
after doxorubicin injection, mice were hemodynamically characterized.
Finally, hearts were excised and prepared for molecular biological and
immunohistochemical analyses as described below. This investigation
conforms with the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals
published by the US NIH (NIH Publication No. 85-23, revised 1996).
Surgical procedures and hemodynamic measurements. Animals were
anaesthetized (thiopental 125 Ag/g; i.p.), intubated, and artificially
ventilated. As described previously (14, 15), a 1.4 F micro conductance
pressure catheter (ARIA SPR-719; Millar-Instruments, Inc.) was positioned
in the LV for continuous registration of LV pressure–volume loops in a
closed-chest model.
Systolic function was quantified by LV end–systolic pressure (LVP;
mmHg), and dP/dt max (mmHg/s) as an index of LV contractility. Diastolic
function was measured by dP/dtmin (mmHg/s), and the end-diastolicpressure-volume relationship (stiffness constant h; mmHg/AL), an indicator

Introduction
Doxorubicin is one of the most widely used anticancer drugs
(1–4). The main limiting factor of this drug is the development of
cardiotoxicity. For example, in a study with 399 patients, the
incidence of congestive heart failure from patients who had
received doxorubicin in a high-dose manner was >18% (5).
Consequently, with respect to the dose-dependent cardiotoxicity
of doxorubicin, an empirical dose limitation of up to 500 mg/m2 is
currently used in clinical practice to minimize the risk of

for LV chamber stiffness, was determined from an exponential fit with the
end-diastolic pressure-volume points (16). Global cardiac function was
quantified by stroke volume (SV; AL), heart rate (HR; beat/min), and cardiac
output (CO; mL/min; ref. 14).
Tissue preparation. For immunohistochemical analyses, cardiac tissues
were embedded in optimal cutting temperature compound (Tissue Tec;
Sakura Finetek). For molecular biological analyses, the isolated heart tissues
were snap frozen immediately in liquid nitrogen and stored at 80jC.
Cardiac activity of lipid peroxidation. LV lipid peroxidation was
measured using the commercially available colorimetric assay kit Bioxytech
LPO-586 (Oxis International; ref. 17). Briefly, 150 AL of protein extracts were
used for measurement of malondialdehyde, and 4-hydroxyalkenals were
used as indicators of lipid peroxidation as described in the manufacturer’s
directions for use.
Immunostaining of nitrotyrosine. Tissue samples of quadriceps
muscles were embedded in optimal cutting temperature compound (Tissue
Tek; Sakura Finetek), frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at 80jC. Serial
5-Am-thick cryosections were placed on 10% poly-l-lysine precoated slides
and fixed in cold acetone. After blocking endogenous peroxidase activity,
sections were incubated with an avidin/biotin blocking kit (Vector
Laboratories, Inc.). Staining was performed with the following primary
antibody at the dilutions given as follows: antinitrotyrosine (Serotec; 1:100).
This antibody was detected using a biotinylated goat-anti-mouse IgG
(Dianova; 1:400). Sections were incubated with peroxidase-conjugated
streptavidin (Vectastatin ABC Elite; Vector Laboratories, Inc.). Antigenantibody complexes were visualized by 3-amino-9-ethylcarbazole (Merck).
The slides were counterstained (Mayer’s hematoxylin), mounted in Kaiser’s
gelatin (both from Merck), and evaluated in a blinded fashion using the
digital image analysis system Lucia G Version 3.52b (Nikon Deutschland
GmbH) as described previously (18).
Western blot analysis. As previously described (19), Western blot
analyses were performed using primary antibodies raised against Bax
(Santa Cruz; diluted 1:500) and Bcl-2 (Santa Cruz; diluted 1:500; Santa Cruz;
1:1,000). Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (Biodesign International; diluted 1:1,500) served as loading control. Detection of the signals
was performed using the LumiPhos reagent (Pierce) and chemiluminescence was detected by X-ray films. For the analysis of superoxide dismutase
(SOD) protein expression, the primary antibodies used were as follows:
Anti-Mn SOD (Calbiochem; diluted 1:1,000), Anti-Cu/Zn SOD (Calbiochem;
diluted 1:1,000), and Anti-EC SOD (R&D Systems; diluted 1:1,000). Detection
of signals was performed using the Western Lightning reagents (PerkinElmer
Lifesciences, Inc.).
Statistical analysis. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS
Version 12.0. Data are expressed as the mean F SE. Statistical differences
were assessed by using the Kruskal-Wallis test in conjunction with the
Mann-Whitney U post hoc test. Differences were considered to be
statistically significant at a P value of <0.05.

Results
LV function in doxorubicin-induced cardiomyopathy. Five
days after doxorubicin injection, untreated mice displayed
significantly impaired systolic (LVP, 29%; dP/dtmax, 45%; P <
0.05), diastolic (dP/dtmin, 44%; stiffness, +275%; P < 0.05), and
global (SV, 61%; HR, 18%; CO, 68%; P < 0.05) LV function when
compared with the placebo group (Table 1). In contrast, among
DoxStatin mice, variables of systolic (LVP, +24%; dP/dtmax, +59%;
P < 0.05), diastolic (dP/dtmin, +40%; stiffness constant h, 66%;
P < 0.05), and global (SV, +75%; CO, +87%; P < 0.05) LV function
were significantly improved compared with untreated doxorubicin
mice (Table 1).
Oxidative stress in doxorubicin-induced cardiomyopathy.
As shown in Fig. 1, in untreated doxorubicin mice, both cardiac
lipid peroxidation activity (+37%; P < 0.05) and cardiac nitrotyrosine protein expression (+204%; P < 0.05) were increased when
compared with placebo mice. In DoxStatin mice, nitrotyrosine
( 56%; P < 0.05), but not lipid peroxidation, was significantly
attenuated when compared with doxorubicin mice values.
Cardiac regulation of SODs in doxorubicin-induced cardiomyopathy. As shown in Fig. 2, 5 days after doxorubicin injection,
cardiac protein expression of SOD1, SOD2, and SOD3 was not
significantly regulated when compared with placebo. In contrast,
SOD2 expression was significantly increased (+18%; P < 0.05) in
DoxStatin mice when compared with doxorubicin mice, whereas
SOD1 and SOD3 were not significantly regulated.
Cardiac tumor necrosis factor A expression in doxorubicininduced cardiomyopathy. As shown in Fig. 3, cardiac protein
expression of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-a was significantly
increased in doxorubicin mice when compared with placebo (+40%;
P < 0.05). Statin treatment led to a significantly decreased TNF-a
expression 5 days after doxorubicin injection ( 26% versus
doxorubicin; P < 0.05).
Apoptotic mechanisms in doxorubicin-induced cardiomyopathy. As shown in Fig. 4, the cardiac protein expression of the
proapoptotic protein Bax was significantly increased in doxorubicin mice when compared with healthy placebo mice (+100%; P <
0.05). Statin treatment led to a suppression of doxorubicin-induced
Bax over expression, approximately down to the basal level of
placebo mice. Whereas the antiapoptotic protein Bcl-2 was not
regulated when compared with placebo and doxorubicin mice,
statin treatment led to a 2.3-fold (P < 0.05) enhanced cardiac
expression of this protein.

Discussion

renin-angiotensin system can reduce the progression of this disease
at the early stage of cardiotoxicity (21–23). Regarding these drugs,
anti-inflammatory effects and changes in LV loading conditions
contributed to their ability to attenuate cardiac damage after
doxorubicin treatment. However, the ability of these treatments to
prevent short- and long-term doxorubicin-induced cardiac damage
has remained limited (24). In the present study, we show that
pretreatment with a statin improved LV function independently of
direct effects on loading conditions because statins influence
neither preload nor after load, and they do not exert any inotropic
effect.
Although it was initially thought that the general reduction of
cardiovascular risk by this drug class was related solely to their
lipid-lowering capacity, it is currently accepted that statins do
exert protective cardiovascular effects, and this in spite of any
lipid lowering (25–27). In this regard, antioxidative properties are
one of the main factors by which statins exert so-called
pleiotropic effects. Because the production of oxidative stress is

Here, we show that pretreatment with the HMG-CoA-reductase
inhibitor fluvastatin leads to cardioprotection against doxorubicin
in mice. We show that a statin-mediated decrease of cardiac
nitrotyrosine production and activated mitochondrial-located
antioxidative and antiapoptotic mechanisms—which were associated with attenuated inflammatory response—contributed to
improved LV function.
In agreement with previous studies and in line with the findings
derived from human studies, doxorubicin in our model led to
severely reduced LV systolic and diastolic function, which
consequently resulted to decreased global heart function as
indexed by suppressed CO (8, 20). The inhibition of HMG-CoAreductase by pretreatment with fluvastatin improved LV function
under these conditions. A number of pharmacologic trials
investigating common cardiovascular drugs as well has been
investigated to reduce cardiac toxicity of doxorubicin. Both

mitochondria, was significantly increased after statin treatment.
This finding suggests that our treatment not only attenuates the
production of oxidative stress, but that it also leads to the
activation of mitochondrial elimination of reactive oxygen species
as well. This is in agreement with previous findings showing that
SOD2 can indeed exert cardioprotection against doxorubicininduced toxicity and other cardiac stress conditions such as
ischemia-reperfusion (31, 32).
To further investigate the effects of statin treatment on
mitochondrial protection, we analyzed two components of the
mitochondrial apoptotic pathway. In agreement with previous
studies from two other groups (33, 34), we, too, found an
activation of the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway in the heart as
indexed by a marked up-regulation of the proapoptotic protein
Bax. In the present model, this was 5 days after doxorubicin
administration, at which time the activation was blunted after
statin treatment. To further investigate mitochondrial mechanisms potentially involved, which may modulate apoptosis, we
measured the antiapoptotic protein Bcl-2 (35), which constitutes
a pivotal regulator of mitochondrial apoptosis (36). A recent study
strengthens the emergent role for Bcl-2 in protecting cardiac cells
against death, including apoptosis (37). Although others have
found a reduction in the antiapoptotic protein Bcl-2 in chronic
doxorubicin-induced cardiomyopathy (34), we found in the acute
situation of our model no regulation of this protein at all.
Interestingly, despite the nonregulation of Bcl-2 due to doxorubicin, the Bcl-2 content after statin treatment was markedly
increased, thereby suggesting a mitochondrial protection against
apoptosis due statin treatment.
We showed in a previous study a strong association between
oxidative stress and cardiac inflammatory response including
cytokine release after doxorubicin treatment (8). One of the
proinflammatory cytokines involved, which mediate cardiac
damage, is TNF-a. doxorubicin led to an increase in cardiac
TNF-a expression in our model, which is in agreement with other
findings (13). Because statin treatment reduced cardiac doxorubicin-induced TNF-a expression in our study, it is intriguing to
speculate that alongside antioxidative mechanisms, it may also be
antiinflammatory mechanisms derived from statin treatment,
which contribute to cardioprotection against doxorubicin-induced
cardiotoxicity.
In summary, inhibition of the HMG-CoA-reductase by pretreatment with fluvastatin led to improved LV function in a mouse
model of doxorubicin-induced cardiomyopathy.
Our data suggest that attenuation of cardiac nitrotyrosine
expression, mitochondrial protection, and cardiac inflammatory
response due to statin treatment may well contribute to improved
heart function. Thus, pretreatment with statin might constitute a
potentially new therapeutic option to prevent doxorubicin-induced

believed to be a hallmark in doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity,
we analyzed two different sources of cardiac oxidative stress,
namely nitrotyrosine expression and lipid peroxidation activity.
Both have been shown previously to contribute to doxorubicininduced cardiotoxicity, a finding which we note too in the present
study (8, 19). Whereas nitrotyrosine expression has been
significantly attenuated by statin treatment, lipid peroxidation
was not affected by this therapy, suggesting that the latter is not a
cardiac target for fluvastatin, at least in our model. This is
however in accord with previous findings of others showing a
suppression of nitrotyrosine expression by statin treatment under
diabetic conditions (28). In our case, we found this drug potency
in doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity.
Another cause of enhanced oxidative stress is, despite any
activated sources, an insufficient activation of antioxidative
mechanisms. In this regard, doxorubicin itself can exert oxidative
effects by the direct production of free radicals (5). For example,
peroxinitrite, a reactive oxidant produced by the rapid reaction of
nitric oxide and superoxide, is a relevant pathophysiologic
mechanism by which doxorubicin can induce cardiac damage
(29). In view of this, antioxidant enzymes play a critical role in
the detoxification of these radicals. Thus, we found it to be of
interest to analyze the regulation of SODs, which are known to
play a major role in preventing the production of reactive oxygen
species (30). There are three isoforms, namely SOD1 (CuZn-SOD),
SOD2 (Mn-SOD), and SOD3 (EC-SOD, where EC stands for
extracellular), and these are all present in different locations of
the heart. In the present study, none of the isoforms were
regulated due to doxorubicin because cardiac protein expression
did not differ significantly between Co and doxorubicin mice. In
addition, statin pretreatment did not affect the regulation of
SOD1 and SOD3. In contrast, SOD2, which is located in the
