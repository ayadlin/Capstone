ABSTRACT
Patients with actively replicating human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) exhibit
adverse reactions even to low irradiation doses. High levels of the virus-encoded viral
protein R (Vpr) are believed to be one of the major underlying causes for increased
radiosensitivity. As Vpr efficiently crosses the blood-brain barrier and accumulates
in astrocytes, we examined its efficacy as a drug for treatment of glioblastoma
multiforme (GBM).
In vitro, four glioblastoma-derived cell lines with and without methylguanineDNA methyltransferase (MGMT) overexpression (U251, U87, U251-MGMT, U87-MGMT)
were exposed to Vpr, temozolomide (TMZ), conventional photon irradiation (2 to 6
Gy) or to combinations thereof. Vpr showed high rates of acute toxicities with median
effective doses of 4.0±1.1 μM and 15.7±7.5 μM for U251 and U87 cells, respectively.
Caspase assays revealed Vpr-induced apoptosis in U251, but not in U87 cells. Vpr
also efficiently inhibited clonogenic survival in both U251 and U87 cells and acted
additively with irradiation. In contrast to TMZ, Vpr acted independently of MGMT
expression.
Dose escalation in mice (n=12) was feasible and resulted in no evident renal
or liver toxicity. Both, irradiation with 3x5 Gy (n=8) and treatment with Vpr (n=5)
delayed intracerebral tumor growth and prolonged overall survival compared to
untreated animals (n=5; p3x5 Gy<0.001 and pVpr=0.04; log-rank test).
Our data show that the HIV-encoded peptide Vpr exhibits all properties of an
effective chemotherapeutic drug and may be a useful agent in the treatment of GBM.

many of these tumors (such as Kaposi’s sarcoma or nonHodgkin lymphoma) are highly radiosensitive, radiotherapy
(RT) of these tumors may be challenging in HIV-infected
patients as they exhibit increased rates of adverse effects
even with highly active antiretroviral therapy [2–6].

INTRODUCTION
Patients infected with the human immunodeficiency
virus (HIV) are highly predisposed to develop AIDSdefining and non-AIDS-defining malignancies [1]. Although

orthotopic xenograft mouse model of malignant glioma.

The agent causing this increase in radiosensitivity
is believed to be a virus-encoded peptide termed Viral
protein R (Vpr) [7]. Vpr can be found virion-associated,
intracellular and extracellular in cerebrospinal fiuid (CSF),
as well as in plasma of HIV-infected patients [8]. Over the
last decade, various activities have been ascribed to the
peptide: First, Vpr has been reported to cause efficient cell
cycle arrest in G2- and M- phases, where cells are most
radiosensitive [9–13]. Second, Vpr induces activation of
caspase 3, 7, 8 and 9 [8, 14], which most likely is mediated
via permeabilization of the mitochondrial membrane,
uncoupling of the respiration chain and release of proapoptotic proteins. Third, Vpr has been found to bind
to host cellular DNA, hereby inducing double strand
breaks and genomic instability [15, 16], which putatively
resembles a conserved mechanism to allow integraseindependent integration of HIV [17].
In addition, Vpr creates cellular damage profiles
similar to cisplatin [18] and alkylating agents [15] and the
use of the protein as a cancer treatment had been proposed
many years ago and the mechanisms behind its effects have
been explored since [19]. Various tumor entities are sensitive
to Vpr, including neuroblastoma (LAN-2), lymphoma
(U937), WHO grade III astrocytoma (U373), cervical cancer
(HeLa), liver (HepG2), kidney (293T), melanoma (B16.F10)
and leukemia (Jurkat T) cells [8, 20–22]. Consequently, first
successful approaches to explore the therapeutic efficacy of
Vpr were made in gene transfer studies, where Vpr overexpression inhibited growth of melanoma (B78/H1) and oral
squamous cell carcinoma cell lines (AT-84) in vitro and in
vivo [10, 23, 24]. The protein was also already employed as
a local therapeutic agent by Siddiqui and colleagues, who
injected Vpr into mammary carcinoma allografts in mice
and observed efficient tumor regression with development
of central necrosis in Vpr-treated tumors [18].
Due to the potential radiosensitizing ability in HIVinfected humans and its alkylator-like cellular damage
signature, we hypothesized Vpr to have potential as a
novel agent for the treatment of high-grade gliomas, and
specifically glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). Whereas
both RT and alkylating agents (i.e. temozolomide, TMZ)
are considered as the current standard for adjuvant
treatment of GBM [25], only modestly improved outcomes
are achievable with TMZ in this tumor entity with reported
median survival rates ranging between 12 and 14 months
[26, 27]. However, in patients (over)expressing the O6Methylguanine-DNA-Methyltransferase (MGMT) gene
due to promoter de-methylation, prognosis is even more
devastating as to date there is no systemic therapy option
with proven efficacy [25, 28].
In the present work we investigated the effects of
Vpr on U251, U251-MGMT, U87 and U87-MGMT cells
alone or in combination with irradiation and TMZ in vitro.
Furthermore, we assessed whether the peptide is tolerated
by mice using a 3+3 dose escalation scheme. Finally, we

RESULTS
Vpr shows high acute toxicity in vitro
U251 and U87 cells were treated with varying
concentrations of medium-dissolved Vpr (0.1 to 20 μM)
for 24 to 72 h (Figure 1a and 1b). Here, Vpr exhibited
a concentration-dependent toxicity both in U251 and
U87 cells in MTT assays. Although both cell lines were
equally susceptible to low doses of Vpr (portion of vital
cells at 1 μM Vpr: 82±3% for U251 cells and 89±4 % for
U87 cells), U251 showed increased sensitivity towards
higher doses (fraction of vital cells at 20 μM Vpr: 11±5
% for U251 cells and 44±18 % for U87 cells) compared
to untreated controls. The median effective doses (EC50)
were 4.0±1.1 μM for U251 and 15.7±7.5 μM for U87 cells
(after 24 hours). When comparing different treatment and
incubation periods, there were no detectable differences
after 24, 48 and 72 h of Vpr exposition, indicating a
predominantly acute toxicity of the peptide.

Vpr induces apoptosis in glioma cells
U251 and U87 cells were exposed to 5 μM Vpr
for 36 h and activity of the effector caspases 3 and 7 was
measured as an indicator of apoptosis. In parallel, the
amount of viable cells was determined at each time point
using an ATP-dependent luminescence assay. In U251
cells,  caspase activity was increased after 12 h and reached
a maximum of 3-fold increase after 24 h (t-test 0 h vs. 24
h: p < 0.05) indicating early apoptosis (Figure 1c). The
fraction of vital U251 cells decreased analogously, thus
the decrease in caspase activity noted after 24 h was likely
caused by a general loss of cells (Figure 1d). Vpr did not
cause an increase in activity of caspase 3/7 in U87 cells
indicating absence of apoptosis. However, cell counts
decreased within 24 h compared to untreated controls,
indicating a predominantly cytostatic than pro-apoptotic
activity of Vpr in these cells.

Vpr and TMZ show weak additive effects
We next assessed the efficiency of a combined
modality treatment with Vpr and TMZ (Figure 2a and 2b).
Here a concentration of 100 μM of TMZ, which is roughly
twice the level achieved in vivo [29], resulted in only
moderate cell kill within 72 h in U251 (portion of vital
cells at 100 μM TMZ: 71±6 %) and U87 cells (84±8 %).
Combined application of TMZ (at a concentration of 100
μM) and Vpr resulted in only mildly elevated cell kill and
revealed a weak additive rather than a synergistic effect of
Vpr and TMZ in U251 (CIm = 0.8±0.4, mean ± SEM) and
U87 cells (CIm = 0.8±0.2, mean ± SEM).

additively with irradiation

53±3 %, p=0.027) after treatment with 10 μM Vpr.
Simultaneously, the sub-G1 fraction (apoptotic cells) of
U251 cells increased after Vpr treatment (10 μM Vpr:
6.9±1.1 vs. 19.2±6.8 %, p=0.037), whereas the sub-G1
fraction of U87 cells remained unchanged.

In combined treatment with RT (2-6 Gy), Vpr alone
(0 Gy) reduced clonogenicity both in U251 and U87 cells
(SF for U251 (geometric means ± SEM): 0.85±0.26 at 5
μM, 0.24±0.004 at 10 μM; SF for U87: 0.71±0.11 at 5
μM; 0.35±0.05 at 10 μM; Figure 2c and 2d). Combination
therapy with irradiation and Vpr also revealed additive
effects (U251: CIm = 1.19±0.25; U87: CIm = 1.14±0.24).

Vpr acts independently of MGMT expression
We used lentiviral vectors to induce MGMT or GFP
(control) over-expression to evaluate whether MGMT may
have a role in Vpr-induced damage repair (Figure 3a and
3b). To also account for late cytotoxic effects of TMZ [31],
we used the colony formation assay. As expected, MGMT
overexpression resulted in marked resistance of U251 cells
towards TMZ (SF of U251-MGMT (geometric means ±
SEM): 0.93±0.11 at 100 μM TMZ vs. 0.10±0.02 for U251GFP; p<0.01; Figure 3c). Similar data were obtained for
U87 cells (SF of U87-MGMT (Geometric means ± SEM):
0.85±0.19 vs. 0.19±0.07 for U87-GFP; p<0.05; Figure
3d). In turn, following treatment with Vpr, both MGMT
and GFP-transduced cell lines showed decreased survival
without statistically significant differences in the fractions,
demonstrating that Vpr effects are entirely independent of
MGMT expression levels (Figure 3e and 3f).

Vpr does not inhibit cell cycle progression
To clarify whether Vpr may also block the G2/M
phase in glioma cells, we performed Nicoletti cell cycle
assays using Vpr concentrations of 5 and 10 μM (Figure
2e and 2f; Supplementary Table 1). TMZ, which is an
efficient G2/M blocker, served as control (100 μM; [30]).
Cells treated with TMZ showed a significant reduction in
G1 (U251: p=0.004; U87: p<0.0001) and an increase in
G2/M portions (U251: p=0.011; U87: p=0.028). Vpr did
not cause a G2/M arrest in the tested cell lines, however,
the G1 fraction decreases slightly but not significantly
in U251 cells and significantly in U87 cells (60±2 vs.

cohort of 3 mice had to be treated with the same dose
(Supplementary Figure 2b). As no more events or deaths
occurred, the dose was escalated to 3x10 mg/kg per day
and finally to 3x20 mg/kg per day. At the highest dose
level (3x20 mg/kg), all mice developed skin irritations in
the form of an asymptomatic livid tail discoloration distal

osmotic pump was chosen to circumvent tail vein injection
after the three cases of local tissue reaction (see above).
The median tumor volumes at day 0 ranged between 0.26,
minimum 0.05, maximum 0.80 mm3 (3x5 Gy group), 0.44,
minimum 0.04, maximum 1.30 mm3 (untreated group),

(Supplementary Figure 3a; all p > 0.18; Mann-Whitney-Utest). Furthermore, tumor volume on day 0 did not correlate
with survival time (Supplementary Figure 3b), indicating
comparable initial conditions for all three groups.
When comparing tumor growth curves, we observed
that constant infusion of Vpr over 1 week resulted in a
delay of intracranial tumor growth as compared to
untreated animals (Figure 4a). While the control group

on the tumors. Consistent with these findings, histological
analyses of murine brains showed tumors with central
tumor necrosis in Vpr-treated and irradiated mice which
was not observed in this extent in untreated mice (Figure
4c). Finally and most importantly, both Vpr and irradiation
significantly prolonged overall survival of tumor-bearing
mice (pVpr=0.041, and p3x5 Gy <0.001; log-rank test;
Supplementary Table 2, Figure 4d). Of note, compared to
all other mice in the trial, the Vpr-treated mouse that died
at day 15 showed the largest initial tumor volume (2.3 mm3
at day 0; Supplementary Figure 3b).

To assess whether Vpr is synergistic to
radiotherapy, we treated tumor-bearing mice with Vpr
(60 mg/kg over one week) and fractionated irradiation
(5x3 Gy). Although this treatment arm contained the
fewest number of mice (n=4) and resulted in the longest
survival of one animal observed within the whole
experiment (41 days after first detection), we did not
detect an statistically significant difference in overall
survival compared to Vpr monotherapy (Supplementary

DISCUSSION

Although the exact mode of action of Vpr is not
clarified yet, it has been described that Vpr induces
double strand breaks [15, 16] causing a cisplatin- and
alkylator-like cellular damage signature [15, 18]. Here,
we also showed that Vpr inhibited clonogenic survival,
indicating a considerable genomic damage upon drug
exposure. Alkylators such as TMZ cause DNA damage
and clonogenic cell death by transferring methyl groups
to DNA, which can be efficiently and timely removed by
MGMT. As the number of viable cells in our MTT assays
did not decrease with prolonged exposure to Vpr (the
maximum observation period was 72 h), we assume that
Vpr rapidly penetrates the cells and subsequently induces
irreversible genomic damage. As we did not see any effect
of MGMT overexpression on survival of U87 and U251
cells, genomic instability caused by Vpr is likely entirely
distinct from this mechanism.
We did not observe Vpr-induced G2/M arrest in
U87 and U215 and, consistent with this, clonogenic
assays revealed no radiosensitizing effects. One reason
may be that we used a truncated version of Vpr lacking
the n-terminus. Although there is consensus that apoptosis
is mediated by the c-terminal end [42, 43], the region of
Vpr causing cell cycle arrest is to date controversially
discussed [44, 45]. A further reason may be that Vpr
induced cell cycle effects are not unspecific and dependent
on different cellular backgrounds. Most of the studies
that demonstrated efficient G2/M arrest were performed
to explore HIV pathogenicity and, consequently, the
cell lines used to evaluate this effect were derived from
lymphomas or leukemias – tumors entirely different to
glioblastoma [11, 12].
An indispensable characteristic of a useful drug
is adequate tolerability of therapeutic doses, which,
due to the apparent high and unspecific toxicity of Vpr,
was a major concern. Considering that acutely infected
patients with actively replicating HIV have peak plasma
levels of Vpr, and patients with chronic replication show
24-hour exposure to the peptide [46], we assumed that
intravenous application of the peptide is tolerated. In our
dose escalation study, local tissue irritation occurred at
highest dose levels (3x20 mg/kg/d) and one case of death
was noted at the lowest dose (3x5 mg/kg/d). Local tissue
irritation or even necrosis is also commonly observed in
the clinical setting after unintended paravenous injection
of chemotherapeutics. It is unlikely that all three mice
were incorrectly injected in our study and thus we decided
to apply the peptide via an osmotic pump with a three-fold
reduced dose (60 mg/kg over one week) in the therapeutic
setting. Although the cause of death could not be clarified
by necropsy, the immunodeficient NOG strain is known to
be a rather susceptible strain and unclear deaths also occur
frequently in untreated NOG mice.
A possibly relevant concern which was not
assessable in our model, is the yet undefined link between
Vpr and AIDS-related dementia. Vpr has been shown to

The current study shows that the HIV-derived
protein Vpr induces apoptosis in glioma cells, acts
independently from MGMT expression status, is tolerated
well when given intravenously, delays intracranial tumor
growth and prolongs survival in a relevant pre-clinical
model of high-grade glioma. Therefore, it has all the
traits of an potentially useful agent for the treatment of
GBM.
In the light of a rather frustrating decade passing
without any significant new therapy option for GBM (and
even less for unmethylated GBM), there is an urgent need
for more effective therapies to improve poor outcomes in
this lethal disease. Novel compounds should i) be able to
cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB), ii) be active against
glioma cells per se and possibly also in those resistant to
TMZ and iii) be tolerated adequately at therapeutic doses.
A minor prerequisite not specifically related to GBM is
a non-complex synthesis and thus an affordable market
price. In our opinion Vpr, a peptide encoded by the human
immunodeficiency virus (HIV), potentially fulfils all of the
mentioned requirements.
In GBM, drugs may not necessarily need to actively
“cross” the BBB as these tumors usually present with a
disrupted BBB [32, 33], which is even further aggravated
by radiotherapy [34–36]. However, although GBM is
characterized by a high local relapse rate, it resembles
a (central nervous) systemic disease as multiple tumor
cells are occultly disseminated throughout the brain at
the time of diagnosis [37]. Therefore, suitable antiglioma
drugs must be also capable of targeting dispersed tumor
cells located in areas with an intact BBB. Vpr may fulfil
these criteria as it efficiently crosses cellular membranes
and is rapidly internalized [38–40]. Vpr is detectable
in significant amounts in cerebrospinal fiuid (CSF) of
HIV-positive patients, indicating that either infected
cells (lymphocytes or microglia) or viral particles cross
the BBB, or blood–CSF barrier transition of Vpr in the
choroid plexus takes place [20, 41].
The second prerequisite is also fulfilled by Vpr:
several reports have demonstrated that Vpr has proven to
be toxic for a variety of tumor cell lines in vitro, including
neuroblastoma and grade III astrocytoma cell lines [8,
20–22]. For the first time, we here showed that the peptide
was not only active in vitro, but also in a murine orthotopic
in vivo model. The protein delayed tumor growth as
indicated by micro-CT analyses and prolonged survival.
It is noteworthy that we measured total tumor volumes,
which included the contrast-enhancing parts, as well as
the non-enhancing parts (necrotic areas) of the tumors.
If we had decided to consider only contrast-enhancing
parts (as suggested by RANO criteria), the differences in
measured tumor sizes between animals treated with Vpr or
irradiation and the untreated control animals would have
been even more prominent.

exert indirect cytotoxic effects by inducing expression
of neurotoxic cytokines in astrocytic and microglial cells
[20]. Although this could potentially improve antitumoral
responses, it may cause or worsen neurodegeneration with
the risk of neurocognitive impairment [47]. However, the
overall survival of GBM patients is poor and this specific
side effect would be only of significance in a small portion
of long-term survivors.
A further advantage of Vpr therapy would be a
relatively low market price. Chemically, Vpr as used in
this study (the C-terminal fragment Vpr52-96) resembles
a simple peptide, roughly of the size of insulin (51 aa)
and less than a third of the size of erythropoietin alpha.
It is soluble in water and stable at 4°C for at least one
month (Jens Kuebler, unpublished results). Thus, due to
the enormous progress in recombinant DNA technology,
large-scale production of recombinant peptides has
become feasible at reasonable prices.
Taken together, this study provides evidence that
Vpr causes both acute and long-term cytotoxic effects
in glioma cells in vitro and in vivo. As the protein acts
independently from MGMT expression status of the tumor
cells, it might become a useful substance in the treatment
of glioblastoma multiforme.

For the construction of pHR’SIN-MGMTp140kFMDV2A-Luciferase, the sequence of the luciferase
reporter gene was amplified from the plasmid pGL3-basic
(Promega, Madison, WI, USA). Overhang PCR was used
to create an additional Apa I restriction site upstream of
the luciferase sequence. The following primers (Metabion,
Steinkirchen, Germany) were used: Luciferase forward 5’
-GCAAGCTTGGGCCCATGGAAGACGCCAAAAAC
ATAAAG-3’; Luciferase reverse 5’-CGTGTACATCG
ACTGAAATCCCTGGTAATCCG-3’. The amplified
luciferase fragment was then inserted into MGMTp140kFMDV2A [50] via ApaI and Xba I. The amplified products
were checked by Sanger sequencing (GATC Biotech AG,
Konstanz, Germany). Next, the fragment MGMTp140kFMDV2A-Luciferase was inserted into the lentiviral
plasmid pHR’SIN-cPPT-SEW [51] using BamHI and
Xba I replacing the coding sequence of eGFP (a second
Xba I site behind the U3LTR was deleted in advance),
resulting in pHR’SIN-MGMTp140k-FMDV2A-Luciferase.
For the transduced controls, we used the vector pHR'SINLuciferase-IRES-eGFP, which is based on pHR'SINSNAI2 [52] and in which the cDNA of SNAI2 upstream of
the IRES-EMCV element was replaced by the cDNA of
luciferase after digestion with BamHI and Xba I.

(Vpr52-96, [N-]GDTWAGVEAIIRILQQLLFIHFRIG CRH
SRIGVTRQRRARNGASRS[-C]), which contains the
active (pathogenic) domain of the viral peptide [40, 48,

commercially synthesized (Caslo ApS, Lyngby, Denmark),
enriched to >99 % purity and delivered as lyophilized
trifiuoroacetate salt (powder). The lyophilized peptide was
dissolved in sterile water and stock solutions were stored
at 4°C. TMZ and O6-BG were dissolved in DMSO. BCNU
(bis-chloroethylnitrosourea/Carmustin) was dissolved
in 100% ethanol. Stock solutions were stored at -20 °C.
All chemotherapeutic drugs were purchased from SigmaAldrich (Munich, Germany).

Lentiviral supernatant was produced as described
before [51, 53]. In brief, 293T cells were transfected with
the lentiviral plasmids pHR’SIN-MGMTp140k-FMDV2ALuciferase or pHR'SIN-Luciferase-IRES-eGFP and the
two packaging plasmids pCMVΔR8.91 and pMD.G in the
presence of Metafectene (Biontex, Martinsried/ Planegg,
Germany). Lentiviral supernatants were then collected
after 48 h, filtrated (0.45 μm pore-size filter; Millipore,
Carrigtwohill, Ireland) and concentrated using Vivaspin
filters (100.000 MWCO; Sartorius, Goettingen, Germany).
Aliquots of the viral supernatants were shock-frozen and
stored at – 80°C. For the determination of viral titers,
HT1080 cells were transduced with serial dilutions of
the viral supernatants in the presence of polybrene (8 μg/
ml; Sigma-Aldrich). Viral titers for the vector pHR’SINLuciferase-IRES-eGFP were determined by fiuorescenceactivated cell sorting analysis for eGFP marker gene
expression. Titers of the pHR’SIN-MGMTp140k-FMDV2ALuciferase vector were determined via a Luciferase
Assay (Promega, Fitchburg, Wisconsin, USA) according
to the manufacturer’s protocol, whereas the intensities
of luminescence were compared to HT1080 cells which
were transduced in serial dilutions with the control vector
pHR’SIN-Luciferase-IRES-eGFP at a multiplicity of
infection (MOI) of 10.

Cells and cell culture
All cell lines described here were obtained from
ATCC (Manassas, VA) and thus no authentication was
done. The human glioblastoma/astrocytoma cell line
U251 was cultured in RPMI-1640 medium (Biochrom
AG, Berlin, Germany). The human high-grade glioma
cell line U87, the human embryonic kidney cell line
293T and the human fibrosarcoma cell line HT1080 were
cultured in DMEM (Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium;
Biochrom). All media were supplemented with 10% FCS,
penicillin (100 IU/ml) and streptomycin (100 μg/ml). Cells
were cultured at 37°C and 5% CO2.

Transduction of cells

6 MV X-rays from a linear accelerator (Synergy, Elekta,
Stockholm, Sweden) at doses up to 6 Gy. Directly after
the irradiation, the medium was removed and cells were
washed carefully with PBS. Thereafter, fresh medium
with supplements was added and cells were allowed to
grow colonies for 14 to 21 days. In experiments without
irradiation (MGMT/eGFP cells lines), the medium was
exchanged after 6 h of treatment and cells were allowed to
grow colonies. Colonies (defined as cluster of >50 cells)
were fixed, stained and counted as described previously
[55].

To generate MGMT-expressing U251 and U87 cells,
both cell lines were transduced in presence of polybrene
(8 μg/ml) with the MGMT vector pHR’SIN-MGMTp140kFMDV2A-Luciferase at a MOI of 1 and the control vector
pHR’SIN-Luciferase-IRES-eGFP at a MOI of 10. The
GFP-positive population of the control cells U251-GFP
and U87-GFP were separated via fiow cytometry (BD
FACSAria I, Becton Dickinson, Heidelberg), and the
sorting process was repeated after 7 days. Cells transduced
with the MGMT-containing vector were subjected to
selection with O6-BG (100 μM) and BCNU (150 μM). To
validate successful selection of MGMT-expressing cells,
the luciferase expression levels were determined using the
Luciferase Assay System (Promega).

Apoptosis and cell viability assays
To detect apoptosis, the Caspase-Glo® 3/7 assay
(Promega, Fitchburg, Wisconsin, USA) was used
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. In brief,
5x103 cells/well were plated in 96 well plates. Vpr (5
μM) was then added and plates were incubated at 37 °C
until measurements were performed at 0, 6, 12, 18, 24,
30 and 36 h after Vpr addition using a microplate reader
(Tecan infinite M200). To quantify (remaining) viable
cells in the apoptosis assays, we used the Cell TiterGlo® Luminescent Cell Viability Assay (Promega) with
identical numbers of plated cells and identical treatments
as performed in the caspase assay.

Irradiation of cells
Cells were irradiated with various doses of 6 MV
X-rays from a conventional linear accelerator (Versa
HDTM, Elekta AB, Stockholm, Sweden). Irradiation was
performed in T25 fiasks (colony formation assay) with
a field setup published previously [54]. In combined
modality treatments (together with Vpr or TMZ) or control
treatments (DMSO), irradiation was performed 6 hours
after the addition of the corresponding substance.

Cell cycle analysis

MTT assay

To determine distribution of cell cycle phases and
the fraction of apoptotic cells (sub-G1) after treatment with
Vpr we used fiow cytometry as described previously [56].
Specifically, 1-2x106 U251 or U87 cells were plated in
T-75 cm² fiasks and cells were allowed to adhere. Next,
Vpr (5 μM or 10 μM) or TMZ (100 μM, DMSO 0.1%)
was added. Cells were incubated for 6 h at 37 °C and
medium was then exchanged. Cells were harvested after
48 h, fixed overnight in 70 % ice-cold ethanol, washed
again and resuspended in PBS. Then, RNase A (2 mg/ml,
Sigma-Aldrich) and propidium iodide (1 mg/ml, SigmaAldrich) was added and, after incubation for 30 min,
cells were analyzed via fiow cytometry (BD FACS Canto
II). The measurement was analyzed using FlowJo 7.6.5
software (Tree StarInc, Ashland, OR, USA).

Cells were seeded in 96-well plates (1 to 5x103/
well) in 80 μl medium with supplements. Then drugs
were added in a volume of 20 μl to the following final
concentrations: Vpr: 0.1 μM to 20 μM; TMZ: 10 μM
to 500 μM. DMSO concentration in all samples was
adjusted to the highest concentration given by TMZ
samples (<0.5 %). 20 μl MTT (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide; 5 mg/ml) was added
24, 48 or 72 h after addition of drugs and the plate was
incubated at 37°C for 4 hours. Formazan crystals forming
after addition of MTT were dissolved with 100 μl SDS
(sodium dodecyl sulfate; 10% in 10 mM HCl) overnight.
Thereafter, absorbance was measured at 590 nm (690
nm reference) using a microplate reader (Tecan Infinite
M200, Tecan AG, Männedorf, Switzerland). Results were
normalized to controls and shown as percent values.

Orthotopic murine glioma model

Colony forming assay

Immunodeficient 6 to 8 weeks old female NSG
mice (NOD.Cg-PrkdcSCID Il2rgtm1Wjl/SzJ, The Jackson
Laboratory, Bar Harbor, Maine, USA) were used for
orthotopic tumor implantation. Prior to surgery, all mice
were anesthetized by subcutaneous injection of MMF (0.5
mg/kg medetomidine, 5 mg/kg midazolam and 0.05 mg/
kg fentanyl) and positioned in a stereotactic frame (TSE
Systems, Bad Homburg, Germany) under an operating
microscope. After drilling of a 0.5 mm burr hole 1 mm
anterior to the bregma and 3 mm lateral to the midline,

Cells were seeded in T25 Flasks (Falcon, BectonDickinson) in the desired densities (2x102 to 6x103)
into 5 ml medium with supplements and in triplicates.
Drugs (Vpr, TMZ and/or DMSO) were added to final
concentrations (Vpr 0 μM to 10 μM; TMZ 0 μM to 100
μM). The concentration of DMSO was adjusted to the
highest concentration given by TMZ samples (0.1%).
Cells were incubated for 6 h at 37°C and irradiated with

enhanced micro-CT (Kirschner et al., in re-submission;
[59]. Briefiy, 300 μl of a iodine-based contrast agent
(Iomeprol; Imeron® 300, Bracco Imaging Group,
Germany) were injected via the lateral tail vein and CTimaging was performed within 5 min as described before
[60, 61]. Tumor volumetry of micro-CT images was
performed by contouring total tumor volumes (contrastenhancing + non-enhancing regions) using OsiriX
Freeware [62].

2x106 U87 cells were injected with a glass syringe (Neuros
Syringe, Hamilton) using a 33G blunt needle into the
basal ganglia over approximately 10 min [57, 58]. For
postoperative pain management, all animals received 200
mg/kg metamizole p.o. (added to tap water). All mice were
sacrificed if they showed neurological symptoms or more
than 20 % of body weight loss. All animal experiments
were approved by the local and governmental authorities.

Treatment with Vpr

Statistics and survival analysis

For tolerance testing, we used a 3+3 study in analogy
to clinical dose finding trials. Due to the mostly acute
effects of the peptide observed in vitro, we considered an
observation period of 14 days to be sufficient to rule out
relevant acute toxic effects in vivo. Three mice of the first
cohort received i.v. injection (lateral tail vein) with 5 mg/
kg of water-dissolved Vpr three times on days 0, 2 and 4
and were closely followed for the development of signs of
toxicity up to day 14. Thereafter, the mice were sacrificed
and blood was subjected to liver (LFT) and renal function
tests (RFT). If no toxicity was noted, the dose was doubled
to 3x10 mg/kg/d and then to 3x20 mg/kg/d. If a mouse
showed pathological LFT, RFT or died, a further group of
3 mice received the same dose. If no signs of toxicity were
observed, the dose was escalated to the next dose level.
For tumor treatment with Vpr, tumor-bearing mice
were anaesthetized using MMF (see above) and an osmotic
minipump (ALZET 2001, DURECT Corp, Cupertino,
CA) was placed subcutaneously with a catheter (MJCAL, DURECT) implanted into the right jugular vein. The
pumps were filled with 170 μl of water-dissolved Vpr to
deliver a dose of 60 mg/kg over a period of 1 week (1
μl/h). Before implantation and after explanation, all pumps
were weighed to ensure correct treatment. Mice bearing
pumps with evident catheter clotting or irregular weight
were excluded from further analyses.

Results of all in vitro assays are presented as means
of at least three independent experiments together with
the corresponding standard deviations. For detection of
statistical differences in all in vitro assays, an unpaired
two-sided t-test was used. To account for multiple
testing in cell culture experiments, we adjusted p values
using Bonferroni correction. For calculation of IC50
values and for evaluation of combination effects, we
used the method of Chou and Talalay [63] available in
the CalcuSyn software suite (Biosoft, Cambridge, UK).
Mean combination index (CIm) values were calculated
and assessed whereby CI values greater than 1, equal
to 1 or smaller than 1 indicated antagonism, additivity
or synergism. Surviving fractions (SF) for irradiation
experiments were fitted by the linear-quadratic model
(ln(SF) = -(αD + βD²)) by nonlinear regression using
SigmaPlot v11 (Systat Software GmbH, Erkrath,
Germany) [55].
Tumor volumes at day 0 in the different treatment
groups were compared using a Mann-Whitney-U test.
For comparisons of in vivo tumor growth, we used an
exponential growth curve model to fit the CT data for
each mouse. No formal statistical testing was performed,
owing to the relatively small number of animals and the
frequency of missing CT data at different time points.
Overall survival (OS) of mice was measured from
the date of diagnosis (defined as the day on which a tumor
was detected in a CT scan) until the date of death and the
log-rank test (Mantel-Cox) was used for comparisons
of survival. All statistical analyses of in vivo data were
performed using SPSS version 22 (IBM Corp., Armonk,
NY, USA).

Irradiation of mice and combined radiotherapy
and Vpr treatment
Irradiation was performed under anesthesia (MMF,
see above) with three coplanar beams in a fractionated
regimen of 15 Gy delivered in three fractions of 5 Gy
by a small-animal irradiation device capable of imageguided radiotherapy [59]. For validation of adequate target
volume coverage we used Gafchromic® films mounted
between RW3 plates (Supplementary Figure 1). In mice
treated with combined therapy (Vpr and radiotherapy),
irradiation was performed one day after implantation of
the osmotic pump.
