Abstract
Radiation-induced genomic instability, in which the progeny
of irradiated cells display a high frequency of nonclonal
genomic damage, occurs at a frequency inconsistent with
mutation. We investigated the mechanism of this nontargeted
effect in human mammary epithelial cells (HMEC) exposed to
low doses of radiation. We identified a centrosome-associated
expression signature in irradiated HMEC and show here that
centrosome deregulation occurs in the first cell cycle after
irradiation, is dose dependent, and that viable daughters of
these cells are genomically unstable as evidenced by spontaneous DNA damage, tetraploidy, and aneuploidy. Clonal
analysis of genomic instability showed a threshold of >10 cGy.
Treatment with transforming growth factor B1 (TGFB), which is
implicated in regulation of genomic stability and is activated by
radiation, reduced both the centrosome expression signature
and centrosome aberrations in irradiated HMEC. Furthermore,
TGFB inhibition significantly increased centrosome aberration
frequency, tetraploidy, and aneuploidy in nonirradiated HMEC.
Rather than preventing radiation-induced or spontaneous
centrosome aberrations, TGFB selectively deleted unstable cells
via p53-dependent apoptosis. Together, these studies show that
radiation deregulates centrosome stability, which underlies
genomic instability in normal human epithelial cells, and that
this can be opposed by radiation-induced TGFB signaling.

Introduction
Radiation-induced genomic instability (RIGI) is a nontargeted
radiation effect, i.e., occurring in the progeny of irradiated cells.
RIGI is evidenced by increased chromosomal instability, apoptosis,
and other deleterious events many generations after irradiation (1).
The high frequency of genomic instability in irradiated bone
marrow cells (2–4) and epithelial cells (5–7) is not consistent with a
mutational mechanism. Although it is thought that RIGI may be an
important determinant of radiation-induced carcinogenesis, the
underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. Radiation-induced
signaling clearly contributes to nontargeted effects (reviewed in

ref. 8). Wright and colleagues (9) have shown in vivo that radiation induces activation of inflammatory cells, which generates
additional DNA damage in bone marrow stem cells long after
exposure. Bauer and colleagues (10) have shown that radiationinduced signals can eliminate transformed cells through selective
apoptosis. These studies are evidence of a multicellular program of
tissue response to damage that includes surveillance for abnormal
cells (11). When normal signaling is altered by radiation, then
surveillance of abnormal cells is compromised, and potentially
genomically unstable cells accumulate and proliferate.
We have recently shown RIGI in clonally expanded, finite life
span, normal human mammary epithelial cells (HMEC) as measured by aberrant karyotypes and supernumery centrosomes (7).
Centrosome aberrations (CA) can induce variable mitotic outcomes including aneuploidy, genomic instability, and cell death
(12). Radiation-induced CA has been reported in cancer cell lines
exposed to high doses associated with prolonged cell cycle arrest
(13, 14), but CA that occur in tumor cells during the first cell cycle
after radiation exposure have been shown to precede mitotic
catastrophe and cell death, thus contributing to therapeutic cytotoxicity (14, 15). To be relevant to RIGI, and ultimately to radiation
carcinogenesis, CA must occur in nonmalignant, reproductively
viable, epithelial cells.
In the current study, we examined CA in irradiated HMEC to
determine whether they accompany, or are the source of, RIGI.
We identified a centrosome gene expression signature based on
published expression microarrays. We then determined that CA
occur in the first cell cycle after radiation exposure, accumulate in
a dose-dependent fashion in the progeny of irradiated HMEC, and
are accompanied by tetraploidy and aneuploidy. CA and spontaneous DNA damage were significantly increased in cells cloned
after irradiation with 50 or 100 cGy. We postulated that extracellular signaling from transforming growth factor h (TGFh),
whose activity is induced by radiation in vivo and in vitro, mediated
the cell fate of unstable cells. TGFh addition reduced the
centrosome gene expression signature and decreased the frequency
of CA, whereas TGFh inhibition increased genomic instability
in irradiated and control HMEC. Rather than preventing CA,
TGFh selectively deleted genomically unstable cells via apoptosis,
resulting in an overall increase in population stability. Thus, endogenous TGFh suppresses radiation-induced and spontaneous
genomic instability, whereas attenuation of TGFh signaling permits
survival of cells with CA, resulting in a dramatic increase in
aneuploid and tetraploid metaphases. These studies support the
hypothesis that CA gives rise to genomic instability in the
daughters of irradiated human epithelial cells but that TGFh
surveillance restricts their persistence and expansion. Thus, interactions between targeted and nontargeted radiation effects in
normal human epithelial cells determine the prevalence of genomic instability.

Radiation-Induced Genomic Instability

Materials and Methods
Cell culture. HMT-3522-S1, 184 A1, and MCF10A (American Type
Culture Collection) were grown in serum-free medium as described (16).
Cells were irradiated with the indicated doses within 6 h of seeding using
60
Co or 160 KvP X-ray; controls were processed identically. The concentrations used were 500 pg/mL TGFh (R&D Systems) and 400 nmol/L TGFh
type I receptor kinase small molecule inhibitor (SMI; Calbiochem) or
treated with 10 Ag/mL TGFh pan-specific neutralizing antibodies (R&D
Systems) or mouse IgG as control. For colony assay, cells were seeded at
clonal density (1,200/0.8 cm2 well) and grown to at least 50 cells per clone.
For clonal analysis, irradiated MCF10A were grown at clonal density, and
6 to 10 colonies per dose were isolated with cloning rings before expansion
in a larger vessel. Clones were then passaged as two populations
for separate metaphase and centrosome analysis. In some cultures,
demecolcine (Sigma) was added for 3 to 5 h to harvest mitotic cells and
standard metaphase preparations were visually counted using 40
magnification. Viability counts were performed using the Vi-Cell counting
system (Beckman Coulter). For rescue experiments, cultures were washed at
day 5 and supplemented for 2 d with TGFh or nutlin-3 (2 Amol/L;
Calbiochem 444143).
Animals. All experiments were conducted with Lawrence Berkeley
National Laboratory institutional animal research review and approval.
Mammary glands were collected from Balb/C Tgfh1 +/ and +/+ mice,
originally obtained from Adam Glick (National Cancer Institute), were bred
and reared inhouse. The inguinal mammary glands were dissected from
animals ages 6 or 18 mo and frozen tissue blocks were stored at 70jC
until sectioning at 3-Am thickness.
Immunofluorescence. Centrosomes were detected in methanol-fixed
HMEC that were blocked with 0.5% casein/PBS, and incubated with a
mouse monoclonal antibody recognizing g-tubulin (Sigma) and/or a
polyclonal recognizing pericentrin (PRB-432C; Covance). Additional antibodies include affinity purified rabbit anti-53BP1 antibody (BL181; Bethyl
Labs) and a rabbit polyclonal recognizing Ki67 (Novacastra). Secondary
antibodies (Molecular Probes) were incubated sequentially for 1 h at room
temperature, washed, and cells were counter stained with 4¶,6-diamidino2-phenylindole (DAPI) before mounting with Vectashield mounting medium
(Vector Labs).
For in vivo analysis of centrosomes, five sections from three mammary
glands per genotype were examined with indirect immunofluorescence
targeting pericentrin and counterstained with DAPI. Proliferation rates
were determined using Ki67. Images were collected, processed, and
analyzed as described (17).
Flow cytometry. Cells were fixed with methanol and stained with
50 Ag/mL propidium iodide according to the manufacturer’s protocol
for fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis. Apoptosis was analyzed
with a monoclonal M30-fluorescein conjugate (Roche) to detect a caspasedependent cleavage fragment of cytokeratin 18. M30-FITC positivity was
defined as intensity >98th percentile in control cells.
Image acquisition and processing. Immunofluorescence images of
cultured cells were obtained using a 40, 1.25 numerical aperture Zeiss
Neofluar objective on a Zeiss Axiovert equipped with epifluorescence.
Images were acquired by locating nuclei using the DAPI image without
reference to the fluorochrome-labeled antibody. Centrosome number and
structure were manually analyzed or analyzed using BIOQUANT image
analysis software (18). Treatments were coded to avoid experimenter bias.
Cells with 3 or more centrosomes, or large, misshapen centrosomes, were
scored as CA. Irradiated populations were normalized to nonirradiated
populations at corresponding time points. For each experimental point,
a minimum of eight fields was acquired from each of three duplicate
cultures. Experiments were replicated thrice unless noted otherwise.
Expression centrosome index. The expression centrosome index (exCI)
was determined as reported (19, 20). An important refinement was that
expression values for centrin1(207209_at), tubg1(201714_at), and pericentrin1(218014_at) were normalized to the mean expression of proliferation
marker Ki67 (212020_s_at, 212021_s_at, 212022_s_at, 212023_s_at) for each
data set, which improved the correlation for the centrosome genes by

controlling indirectly for relative proliferation. Expression values for the
three centrosome genes were obtained from published data sets from
reference (16), in which microarrays were conducted in quadruplicate from
sham-irradiated, irradiated, and/or TGFh-treated MCF10A cells. These
values were then normalized to mean expression from the sham-treated
data set. For coexpression analyses, we determined and ranked Pearson
correlation coefficient (PCC) values between the exCI and all genes tested
on the array over the eight relevant data sets ( four each of irradiated and
irradiated treated with TGFh). As the exCI was normalized to Ki67
expression, Ki67 probes were removed from the coexpression analysis.
Statistical analysis. Differences between samples and/or treatment
groups were compared with two-sided t test using Prism GraphPad
software. ANOVA between groups was used for dose response experiments.
K-S tests were used to compare population differences.

Results
Ionizing radiation induces CA in a rapid and dosedependent manner. A gene exCI has been shown to correlate
with immunofluorescence analysis of CA and serve as a surrogate
for centrosome amplification (19, 20). We analyzed a previously
reported gene expression microarray profiles of irradiated HMEC
(16) and found that the exCI was significantly increased in three
of four replicates after radiation relative to sham. We then determined the frequency of CA in nonmalignant HMEC during the first
72 hours after exposure to 50 cGy X-radiation, a dose that did not
cause cell cycle arrest (data not shown). Centrosomes were
monitored by either of two pericentriolar material markers, pericentrin or g-tubulin, which colocalize. The frequency of CA in the
population of irradiated HMEC increased in a time-dependent
manner (Fig. 1A), suggesting that such cells were viable and that
CA were maintained through each generation of daughter cells.
We next exposed HMEC to graded radiation doses shortly after
plating and measured CA upon reaching confluence 6 to 8 days
later. CA frequency was increased linearly as a function of dose in
two different HMEC cell lines (Fig. 1B). Replating a population
arising from irradiated cells (2 Gy) showed that irradiated cells had
nearly 2-fold more CA after subculture than controls (13.8% F 1.0%
versus 7.0% F 0.7%; P < 0.001). Tetraploid (8N) metaphases indicate
an ineffective postmitotic checkpoint and correlate with aneuploidy, karyotypic abnormalities, and tumorigenesis (21, 22). Tetraploid
metaphases were significantly increased (2.2% F 1.2% versus
0.3% F 0.2%) in the progeny of HMEC irradiated with 2 Gy
compared with controls. Thus, in contrast to tumor cells (14, 15),
radiation-induced CA in nonmalignant HMEC does not result
in mitotic catastrophe or immediate apoptosis, is not residual (i.e.,
cells with CA are reproductively viable), and is not a consequence
of radiation-induced senescence. These data suggest that radiationinduced CAs are compatible with proliferation in normal human
epithelial cells.
Genomic instability is defined as nonclonal genomic damage,
is often highly variable within a given population, and is evidenced
by multiple end points (23). Centrosome amplification has been
postulated to drive genomic instability in breast cancer (24).
Spontaneous DNA damage occurs in early malignant progression
in human tissues concomitant with genomic instability (25, 26). To
confirm that CA and instability were contemporaneous features of
the progeny of irradiated human epithelial cells, we measured CA
(Fig. 1C) and spontaneous DNA damage response (DDR) foci
measured using 53BP1 (Fig. 1D) in clonal outgrowths from cells
irradiated with different doses. The frequency of CA in clones from
irradiated cells was significantly increased (ANOVA, P < 0.05), as
were DDR foci (ANOVA, P < 0.05). Furthermore, both CA and DDR

analysis of the frequency of cells with >5 spontaneous

HMEC irradiated with 50 cGy or more exhibited
genomic instability.

foci were significantly increased in the clones from cells irradiated
with 50 and 100 cGy compared with clones from sham irradiated
and 10 cGy–irradiated cells (K-S test of sham and 10 cGy versus
50 and 100 cGy, P < 0.05). These data suggest a threshold of
>10 cGy for RIGI as evidenced by increased CA and DDR in the viable
progeny of irradiated cells. As expected, the frequency of CA
and aneuploidy were correlated in HMEC clones such that clones
with higher CA produced more aneuploid metaphases. Seventy-five
percent (8 of 12) of clones from irradiated cells had high levels
of aneuploidy compared with 20% (1 of 5) of control clones. Aneuploidy is a hallmark of epithelial tumors, and was proposed as a root
cause of cancer more than a century ago (reviewed in ref. 27).
TGFB modulates centrosome amplification. One of the
confounding issues in studying RIGI is that the level of response
varies between cell types. We hypothesized that this variability was
in part due to radiation-induced paracrine signaling that was
unaccounted for. Others and we have shown that TGFh is rapidly
activated in response to radiation in vivo and autocrine TGFh
regulates mammary epithelial proliferation and DDRs in vivo.
TGFh is activated by low doses of radiation even in the serum-free
cultured conditions used in these studies (16), but the stroma is a
major source of TGFh activity in vivo (28). Furthermore, TGFh is
implicated in genomic instability in cultured Tgfh1 null keratinocytes (29), microsatellite instability in colon carcinoma cells
(30), and intercellular induction of apoptosis, whereby nontransformed cells selectively remove transformed cells (10). As we have
shown that chronic TGFh also promotes epithelial-mesenchymal
transition in irradiated HMEC (16), its role in HMEC and RIGI is
of interest.
We hypothesized that TGFh might be limiting in HMEC culture
and that addition of TGFh would prevent CA in irradiated HMEC.
However, TGFh treatment (500 pg/mL) did not affect radiationinduced CA in the first 3 days postradiation (data not shown),
which indicated that TGFh did not block radiation-induced
CA from occurring. Nonetheless, TGFh treatment for 6 to 8 days
after radiation significantly reduced radiation-induced CA

Cancer Res 2008; 68: (20). October 15, 2008

(Fig. 2A). TGFh treatment also reduced both radiation-induced
and spontaneous CA in HMEC grown at clonal density (Fig. 2B).
Furthermore, TGFh neutralizing antibodies, which block ligandreceptor interactions, increased CA after radiation compared with
cells treated with control IgG (Fig. 2C). Because CA destabilize
chromosome segregation, then TGFh should also suppress
aberrant metaphases in irradiated HMEC. Radiation-induced
tetraploidy was dramatically decreased by the addition of TGFh
as a function of time (Fig. 2D). To further test whether TGFh
mediates the cell fate decisions of irradiated cells, we used a SMI
of TGFh type I receptor kinase, which impedes the signaling
cascade after ligand binding (31). SMI treatment significantly
increased, whereas TGFh treatment unexpectedly decreased,
spontaneous CA (Fig. 3A), tetraploid metaphases (Fig. 3B), and
aneuploidy (Fig. 3C) relative to control cultures. These data
suggests that TGFh is crucial in mediating RIGI, but that levels
under these serum-free culture conditions are suboptimal for
strict control of aberrant cells. Together, these data indicate that
both autocrine and paracrine TGFh affect the survival of genomically unstable epithelial cells that occur spontaneously or after
radiation exposure.
Based on these data, we hypothesized that Tgfh1 heterozygote
mammary epithelia would be at greater risk for centrosome
deregulation. Centrosome analysis in situ requires the use of a
centrosome/nucleus index (17). The centrosome index of the
mammary epithelium of 6-month-old Tgfh1 heterozygote mice
was significantly increased compared with wild-type mice (1.5 F
0.1 versus 1.1 F 0.1), and further increased at age 18 months (2.3 F
0.2 versus 1.3 F 0.1). To test whether there was a functional
consequence of CA, we measured the frequency of tetraploid cells
in mammary epithelial cells isolated from Tgfh1 heterozygote and
wild-type mice. The frequency of tetraploid cells was almost
doubled in Tgfh1 heterozygote compared with wild-type (4.1% F
0.4% versus 2.4% F 0.04%; P < 0.02). Thus, TGFh levels mediate the
frequency of spontaneous CAs and tetraploidy in normal mammary
epithelium in vivo.

TGFB induces selective p53-dependent apoptosis of unstable
cells. Because TGFh did not inhibit the production of CA over
the first 72 hours, but effectively reduced CA frequency in
established cultures, we hypothesized that cells with CA were
eliminated after they were generated. We noted that the exCI

signature was decreased in TGFh-treated HMEC; therefore, we
examined the expression data sets for genes that were highly
correlated, both positively and negatively, to exCI, after irradiation
in the presence or absence of TGFh. PCC values were determined
between the exCI and f22,300 probes for the microarray data

sets in each treatment. Of the genes most positively correlated with
exCI in irradiated cells were three genes associated with
prosurvival/antiapoptosis (DAXX, EMP1, and SPN), whereas two
apoptotic-related genes (BRCA1 and APOE) were negatively
correlated (Table 1). BRCA1 regulates caspase-3 cleavage, but
more interestingly, decreased BRCA1 has been linked to genomic
instability (32). We confirmed that both BRCA1 mRNA and protein
levels were suppressed by TGFh inhibition (Supplementary Fig. S1).
We then determined that TGFh treatment significantly increased
(P < 0.03) apoptosis in irradiated HMEC 48 to 72 hours
postradiation compared with unirradiated controls using flow
cytometry to measure M-30, an apoptotic marker (Fig. 4A). The
delayed induction of apoptosis suggested that TGFh was acting
selectively. To test whether TGFh selectively induced apoptosis
of genomically unstable cells, untreated cultures and SMI-treated
cultures were washed at day 5 and then treated with TGFh. TGFh
addition increased apoptosis (Fig. 4B) concomitant with decreased
frequency of CA (Fig. 4C). More importantly, TGFh rescue
specifically increased apoptosis in the DNA fractions that represent tetraploid cells (Fig. 4D). Together, these data suggested that
TGFh selectively induces apoptosis in genomically unstable human
epithelial cells.
Our research (33, 34), and that of others (35–37), has shown that
TGFh signaling plays an essential role in p53 activity and DNA
damage–induced apoptosis. Because TGFh inhibition can compromise p53 phosphorylation that mediates its activity (33, 34),
and loss of p53 can also increase CA, tetraploidy, and tumorigenesis
(22, 38), we considered whether TGFh was acting via p53. If so,
then forced p53 activation should mimic TGFh rescue. Nutlin-3, a
small molecule antagonist of MDM2, stabilizes p53 and subsequent
processes (39). Nutlin-3 treatment significantly increased apoptosis
(Fig. 4B) and suppressed persistent CA (Fig. 4C) in lieu of TGFh.
Importantly, Nutlin-3 did not alter apoptosis in TGFh-supplemented cultures (Fig. 4D). Therefore, small molecule stabilization
of the p53 pathway is redundant with TGFh in this rescue assay.
Together, these data are consistent with the model in which TGFh
mediates surveillance of RIGI via selective, p53-dependent
apoptosis (Fig. 5).

Discussion
Many studies over the last decade have shown that the progeny
of irradiated cells exhibit increased nonclonal chromosomal
rearrangements, gene amplification, and aneuploidy (reviewed in
ref. 40). Given that genomic instability is highly correlated with
early events in breast cancer progression (24, 41), RIGI is likely an
important determinant of radiation risk. However, the National
Academy report on the biological effects of ionizing radiation

(BEIR VII, 2006) concluded that most reports of RIGI lack
mechanistic information and were thus judged premature to
incorporate into the modeling of radiation epidemiologic data.
We provide substantial evidence that centrosome deregulation is
a mechanism to generate RIGI in human epithelial cells. RIGI
measured by aberrant karyotypes occurs in clonally expanded,
finite life span, normal HMEC and is accompanied by CA (7). We
show here that CA occur in the first cell cycle postirradiation of
nonmalignant HMEC, thus preceding RIGI. CA accumulated in a
dose-dependent fashion in bulk population and were correlated
with tetraploidy and anueploidy. Furthermore, HMEC cloned from
cells irradiated with 50 or 100 cGy exhibit increased CA and
aneuploidy, and also spontaneous DDR foci, which are highly
correlated with malignant progression (25, 26). Together, these
data are consistent with a targeted radiation effect on centrosome regulation that initiates an unstable state in daughter cells.
We then show that the cytokine TGFh plays a critical role in
monitoring RIGI. TGFh addition did not inhibit the generation
of CA but rather eliminated cells with established CA through a
p53-dependent apoptotic mechanism.
A centrosome regulatory microarray signature that had been
identified in myeloid leukemia (20, 21) was evident in irradiated
HMEC. This signature was positively correlated to the expression of
prosurvival, antiapoptotic genes, and negatively correlated to the
expression of proapoptotic genes and was reciprocally affected by
TGFh. It is not known whether these genes are markers or
instrumental in the responses we observed. The selective deletion
of genomically unstable human epithelial cells by TGFh shown
here parallels that shown by Bauer and colleagues (10) in which
TGFh generated by nontransformed neighboring cells triggers
selective ablation of transformed rodent fibroblasts in culture,
which is augmented by low-dose radiation. Together, these studies
support the existence of a surveillance network that operates
between cells and tissues whose action reduces the burden of
genomically unstable cells in the epithelium, and thus the risk of
cancer (11). Recent mathematical models of such effects suggest
that very low dose radiation exposures could stimulate surveillance
and thereby reduce cancer incidence (42). Experimental studies by
Evan and colleagues (43) have shown that restoration of p53
activity in p53 null mice 6 days after radiation exposure results in
substantial tumor delay. In light of our prior work showing that
radiation induces persistent TGFh activation in vivo and the
current studies, it is reasonable to speculate that TGFh could be
the endogenous trigger of this type of response.
TGFh effects are complex and paradoxical in carcinogenesis as it
acts as a potent tumor suppressor early in carcinogenesis but later
converts to a mediator of tumor progression and invasion (44). Part
of the latter action is thought to be due to the ability of TGFh to

drive epithelial to mesenchymal phenotypic switching in cancer
cells with activated mitogen-activated protein kinase (45). We
have shown that TGFh treatment, as might be derived from the
stroma, of irradiated nonmalignant HMEC also induces epithelial
to mesenchymal transition (EMT) and aberrant epithelial morphogenesis (16, 46). Thus, our cell culture model consisting of HMEC
exposed to low doses of radiation and cultured in TGFh is further
evidence of the two-edged sword of TGFh. TGFh signaling in

irradiated tissues could either both promote neoplastic progression (e.g., EMT) or be directed toward re-establishment of homeostasis
and the elimination of abnormal cells. Our interpretation of the
relationship between these phenomena observed in cell culture is
that TGFh can delete genomically unstable cells that arise as a
consequence of radiation, but that continued, chronic exposure
induces the remaining population to undergo EMT. The complexity
of radiation effects mediated by TGFh will require further study

using mouse models to determine whether, and under what
circumstances, TGFh reduces the risk of cancer by suppressing
RIGI, or if it accelerates radiogenic carcinogenesis by promoting EMT.
CA seem to be a targeted radiation effect (i.e., occurring directly
in the irradiated cells) because they are proportionally induced
with doses of 10 cGy and above (Fig. 1B). TGFh-mediated aberrant
HMEC morphogenesis is also acutely sensitive to radiation
exposures of as little as 10 cGy, but the dose responses are quite
distinct. IR acts more like a switch in priming cells to undergo EMT
in that irradiation with either 2 or 200 cGy seem to be equally
effective.1 Likewise, there does not seem to be dose-dependent
induction of RIGI (7). Perhaps more importantly, although cells
irradiated with 10 cGy exhibited CA, CA and DDR foci in cells cloned
after 10 cGy were comparable with controls, suggesting that there is
a threshold. We speculate that low level RIGI was efficiently suppressed by autocrine TGFh. Surveillance by endogenous TGFh
was evident in that various indices of genomic instability increased

when autocrine TGFh signaling was inhibited by SMI or neutralizing antibodies in both control and irradiated (2 Gy) HMEC.
In summary, our data indicate that RIGI results from a targeted
effect that generates an unstable state in nontargeted daughters
but is offset by selective deletion mediated by extracellular
signaling.
