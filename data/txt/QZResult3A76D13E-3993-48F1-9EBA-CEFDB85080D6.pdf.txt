ABSTRACT
KRAS mutations seem to indicate a poor outcome in Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer
(NSCLC) but such evidence is still debated. The aim of this planned ancillary study
within the TAILOR trial was to assess the prognostic value of KRAS mutations in
advanced NSCLC patients treated with platinum-based first-line chemotherapy.
Patients (N = 540), enrolled in the study in 52 Italian hospitals, were centrally
genotyped twice in two independent laboratories for EGFR and KRAS mutational
status.
Of these, 247 patients were eligible and included in the present study. The
primary endpoint was overall survival (OS) according to KRAS mutational status in
patients harboring EGFR wild-type.
Sixty (24.3%) out of 247 patients harbored KRAS mutations. Median OS was
14.3 months and 10.6 months in wild-type and mutated KRAS patients, respectively
(unadjusted Hazard Ratio [HR]=1.41, 95%Confidence Interval [CI]: 1.03-1.94
P = 0.032; adjusted HR=1.39, 95%CI: 1.00-1.94 P = 0.050). This study, with all
consecutive patients genotyped, indicates that the presence of KRAS mutations
has a mild negative impact on OS in advanced NSCLC patient treated with a firstline platinum-containing regimen. Trial Registration: clinicaltrials.gov identifier

KRAS is a member of the ras gene family which
encodes small G proteins with intrinsic GTPase activity.
GTPase activity leads to protein inactivation and activates
downstream effectors involved in multiple pathways
including proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis. Point
mutations occur in tumors resulting in the loss of intrinsic
GTPase activity and consequently in the deregulation of
cell proliferation signals [1].
KRAS is the most frequently mutated oncogene
in Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) [2]. KRAS
mutations are present in approximately 20% of lung
adenocarcinomas, are more frequent in smokers, while
infrequent in squamous cell tumors [3]. KRAS mutations
in NSCLC are mainly missense in exon 2, codon 12 and
13, although other rare variants, such as codon 61, are also
occasionally detected [4].
Although the ras gene was discovered almost thirty
years ago, the role of KRAS mutations as prognostic and
predictive markers in NSCLC cancer is still contentious [5,
6]. The available meta-analyses suggest that patients with
wild-type KRAS have a better prognosis. On the other
hand, the predictive role of KRAS mutations is uncertain
caused by evidence mainly based on retrospective
series with contradicting results likely due to patients
selection bias, and therefore to the lack of proper planned
randomized trials [7-11].
In addition, it seems that different types of KRAS
mutations, according to the replaced bases, have a
different role in carcinogenesis and drug response [12-15].
The aim of the study was to investigate, in terms of
overall survival (OS) and progression free survival (PFS),
the role of KRAS mutations in advanced EGFR wild-type
NSCLC patients treated with first-line platinum-based
chemotherapy.

1 whereas the baseline characteristics of the patients
included in the study according to KRAS mutational status
are illustrated in Table 2.
KRAS mutational status was associated with tumor
histology (P = 0.038) and smoking habit (P = 0.006). The
mutated KRAS subgroup of patients had, as expected,
a higher percentage of adenocarcinoma histology
(85.0% compared to 65.8% for mutated and wild-type
respectively) and a lower prevalence of never smoker
patients (6.7% compared to 22.5% for mutated and wildtype respectively). All the other characteristics were well
balanced between the two groups.
All
patients
received
platinum-doublet
chemotherapy in the first-line setting with higher
percentage of wild-type KRAS tumor patients receiving
gemcitabine (57.1%) as compared to mutated tumor
patients (37.9%). The latter received pemetrexed in a
higher (50.0%) percentage compared to wild-type (30.4%).
Vinorelbine option was less frequent but homogenously
administered (12.5% and 12.1% in wild-type and mutated
tumor patients respectively).
One-hundred and thirty-five patients were
randomized in the main clinical trial. In particular, 52.4%
and 56.7% of wild-type and mutated patients respectively
were further treated with docetaxel in second-line
treatment. On the other hand, 47.6% of wild-type and
43.3% of mutated patients received erlotinib. Among the
randomized patients a higher percentage of patients with
KRAS mutant tumor did not reach the third-line treatment
(76.7%) compared to wild-type (54.3%) (P = 0.028).

RESULTS
Between October 12, 2007 and March 13, 2012
we collected and genotyped for KRAS and EGFR 540
patients in the TAILOR trial [16]. Of these, 213 patients
were not eligible for the present study for various reasons:
adjuvant therapy (N = 177), missing data (N = 24), early
stages at the time of first-line treatment (N = 6), KRAS
status not evaluable (N = 3) and early death (N = 3). Eighty
patients with tumor harboring EGFR gene mutations were
also excluded. Of the remaining 247 eligible patients, 187
(76.8%) had wild-type KRAS tumor, whereas 60 (24.3%)
had a tumor with a mutated KRAS. Nine different types
of KRAS mutations were identified and the three most
common were G12C (43.3%), G12V (23.3%) and G12D
(10.0%) as reported in Table 1. G13 mutation isoforms
(G13C and G13D) were seen in 6.7% (N = 4) of all
mutated cases.

Survival outcomes
After a median follow-up of 52.5 months
(95%Confidence Interval [CI] 42.0-64.7), 225 patients had
progressed or died and 202 had died.
Median OS was 14.4 months (95%CI 10.9-19.4)
for patients with wild-type KRAS tumor and 10.6 months
(95%CI 8.4-12.9) for those with mutant tumor (Figure
2A). The survival of patients with tumor harboring
mutated KRAS was significantly lower than in wild-type
group (unadjusted Hazard Ratio [HR] = 1.41 95%CI: 1.031.94 P = 0.032; adjusted HR = 1.39, 95%CI: 1.00-1.94 P

common KRAS mutations, separately analyzed (G12C,
G12D and G12V), was not different when compared
to wild-type although all mutations had worsening
trend (Figure 3A). The 4 patients harboring G13 KRAS
mutations showed a median OS of 9.0 months.

different biological characteristics.
Our study confirms that a small negative prognostic
effect of KRAS mutations can be observed in advanced
NSCLC patients treated with a platinum-based doublet
when EGFR mutant patients are excluded from the
analysis. TAILOR results are superimposable to those
found by Mascaux et al., the only meta-analysis performed
on the role of KRAS in predicting efficacy of chemotherapy
[10].
In addition, our epidemiological results are in line
with literature: KRAS mutations are strongly correlated
with smoking habit and adenocarcinoma histology and are

DISCUSSION
In the last 20 years many studies, including metaanalyses, with more than 8,000 patients considered have
been published analyzing the prognostic and predictive
role of KRAS mutations in NSCLC The majority of these
results indicated KRAS as a negative prognostic and
predictive marker [7-11, 17]. All these data were drawn
from uncontrolled series and they included patients with

mutually exclusive with EGFR mutations [3].
In a planned subgroup analysis of the main TAILOR
study the KRAS mutations effect was not so clearly
observed, although we cannot exclude a similar effect
to the one presented in this paper with higher number of
patients [18]. This difference may lay in the low statistical
power of the TAILOR second-line subgroup analysis,
or it may depend on a selected population with a better
prognosis that can receive a second-line. Considering that
a higher percentage of patients with a mutant KRAS tumor
did not even underwent third-line treatment compared
to wild-type we do not find these results in contrast with
those previously reported by our group.
This analysis has some strengths and some
limitations. The major strength is that this is the only
pre-planned study in which KRAS status was evaluated
in all consecutive patients included in the analysis and
for whom EGFR mutations were also known. However,
it is not possible to discriminate if the slightly worse
prognosis of KRAS mutated patients is dependent on the
poor prognostic effect of KRAS mutation or on a lesser
response to the chemotherapy of these patients.
The treatment choice was done by physicians based
on patients and disease characteristics therefore we cannot
differentiate the final effect of cisplatin, carboplatin or
other chemotherapeutic doublet agents according to KRAS
status. On the other hand, the association between KRAS
status and type of first-line chemotherapy can be explained
by choice of treatment based on tumor histology, which
is associated to the KRAS status. Nevertheless, the poorer
outcome of mutated KRAS patients cannot be explained
by a confounding effect related to second-line treatments
given that wild-type and mutated KRAS patients were
equally distributed in the two treatment arms in the main
trial.
Results of the LACE-Bio pooled analysis, the
largest pooled analysis encompassing 1543 patients from
four large adjuvant studies (JBR.10, ANITA, CALGB,
IALT), showed that there is no difference in terms of
prognosis in early stage lung cancer patients with either
wild-type or mutated KRAS [19]. Our different results
could raise the hypothesis that KRAS mutations may play
a different role in early and in advanced disease. This
biological hypothesis could corroborate the evidence that,
in advanced stages, KRAS is a condition necessary, but
not sufficient to explain a more aggressive phenotype.
Other additional factor(s) could contribute to this KRAS
effect such as DNA repair capability. Advanced KRAS
mutated tumors might have a DNA repair imbalance more
pronounced than in early stages and our group is working
actively on this issue [20, 21].
Due to small sample number, we are not able to
elucidate any role for the three single most common
KRAS mutations although the different variants seem
to confer different OS when compared to the wild-type.
Interestingly enough, preliminary preclinical data obtained
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

in our laboratory in isogenic NSCLC cells differing only
for the presence of KRAS mutations seem to suggest that
the activity of cisplatin is different in cells expressing the
different KRAS mutations [12].
Furthermore, the LACE-Bio pooled analysis pointed
out that mutations in the codon 13 may confer a worse
prognosis than others [19]. Although in TAILOR we have
only an handful of G13 mutations, results seem to confirm
this hypothesis.
The concept that not all KRAS mutations behave in
the same way and that they differently impact on tumor
progression has been addressed [12, 14, 15]. This data
together with the indications reported in our study may
suggest that proper trials need to be planned to define
the role of the specific mutations in terms of response to
treatment and tumor progression.
In conclusion, although KRAS showed a prognostic
effect in first-line platinum-based treatment in advanced
NSCLC, this study leads us to conclude that it is not
warranted to test KRAS in clinical practice, at least until
a specific targeted therapy is available for this group of
patients. However, the potential mechanism of resistance
to platinum-based therapies of these tumors should be
further explored.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study design
TAILOR was a not-for-profit multicentre, open
label, randomized trial, funded by the Italian Regulatory
Agency AIFA and conducted in 52 Italian hospitals,
comparing erlotinib versus docetaxel in second-line
NSCLC and details have been published elsewhere
[16]. Within the TAILOR trial we planned an ancillary
study to assess the prognostic value of KRAS mutations
in advanced NSCLC patients treated with a first-line
platinum containing regimens.
Briefly, tumor samples from registered patients
were histologically centrally reclassified according with
the 2004 WHO classification. Suitable samples were
genotyped in parallel by investigators in two independent
laboratories using two different techniques: EGFR by
Sanger’s sequencing and restriction fragment length
polymorphism whereas KRAS by Sanger sequencing
and high-resolution melting analysis. Scorpion/ARMS
technique was used for low-material samples. The
Italian central authority and ethical review board at each
participating Institution approved the protocol. The study
complied with the declaration of Helsinki and was done
in accordance with good clinical practice guidelines. Trial

confidence intervals and P values for two sided hypothesis
test were reported.
All statistical analyses were carried out using SAS
version 9.2 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC).

Participating centers registered all consecutive
patients with NSCLC before or during first-line platinumbased chemotherapy as well as patients recurred after
a first-line adjuvant platinum-based chemotherapy.
Only those with both EGFR and KRAS status centrally
determined were included in the trial. All patients received
platinum-based chemotherapy in combination with either
vinorelbine, gemcitabine or pemetrexed according to the
physician’s choice. Combinations with taxanes and with
anti-EGFR agents were not allowed. Patients with EGFR
mutations, early stages patients and patients receiving
the adjuvant therapy were excluded from this analysis.
All patients had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group
(ECOG) Performance Status (PS) between 0 and 2 and
were at least 18 years of age. Exclusion criteria included
any evidence of serious co-morbidities that the investigator
judged as a contraindication to the participation in the
study, pregnancy and breast feeding. Patients were
considered former smokers if they smoked more than 100
cigarettes in their life and they stopped this habit for at
least one year at the time of diagnosis as used in most
of smoking-habits analyses [22, 23]. All patients who
were eligible for participation provided written informed
consent with all applicable governing regulations before
undergoing any study procedure.

Statistical methods
The analysis was planned at the occurrence of 200
events, needed to detect a Hazard Ratio ≥1.60 (mutated
KRAS vs. wild-type KRAS) assuming a KRAS mutation
frequency of 25% with a statistical power of 80% and twosided type I error of 5%.
The primary endpoint was OS defined as the time
from the day of first-line treatment start to the date of
death from any cause. The secondary endpoint was PFS
defined as the time from the day of first-line treatment
start up to the date of first progression or death from any
cause, whichever came first. Patients who had not died or
had disease progression at the date of study cutoff were
censored at the last available information on status. Timeto-event data were described by the Kaplan-Meier curves.
Cox proportional hazards models were used for univariate
and multivariate analysis (adjusted for ECOG-PS, stage,
type of first-line chemotherapy) to estimate and test
demographic characteristics, clinical features, and biologic
parameters for their associations with OS and PFS. We
also evaluated OS and PFS according to the different
subtypes of KRAS mutations.
Moreover we evaluated the association between
the status of KRAS and clinical and histopathological
characteristics by means of Chi-square test.
