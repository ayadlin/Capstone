BACKGROUND: High-dose methotrexate (HDMTX)-induced acute kidney injury is a rare but life-threatening complication. The methotrexate rescue agent glucarpidase rapidly hydrolyzes methotrexate to inactive metabolites. The authors retrospectively reviewed glucarpidase use in pediatric cancer patients at their institution and evaluated whether subsequent resumption of HDMTX was tolerated.
METHODS: Clinical data and outcomes of all patients who received glucarpidase after HDMTX administration were reviewed.
RESULTS: Of 1141 patients who received 4909 courses of HDMTX, 20 patients (1.8% of patients, 0.4% of courses) received 22 doses of
glucarpidase. The median glucarpidase dose was 51.6 U/kg (range, 13-65.6 U/kg). At the time of administration, the median plasma
methotrexate concentration was 29.1 lM (range, 1.3-590.6 lM). Thirteen of the 20 patients received a total of 39 courses of HDMTX
therapy after glucarpidase. The median time to complete methotrexate excretion was 355 hours (range, 244-763 hours) for the
HDMTX course during which glucarpidase was administered, 90 hours (range, 66-268 hours) for the next HDMTX course, and 72
hours (range, 42-116 hours) for subsequent courses. The median peak serum creatinine level during these HDMTX courses was 2.2
mg/dL (range, 0.8-9.6 mg/dL), 0.8 mg/dL (range, 0.4-1.6 mg/dL), and 0.6 mg/dL (range, 0.4-0.9 mg/dL), respectively. One patient
experienced nephrotoxicity upon rechallenge with HDMTX. Renal function eventually returned to baseline in all patients, and no
patient died as a result of methotrexate toxicity. CONCLUSIONS: The current results indicated that it is possible to safely resume

INTRODUCTION
Methotrexate is 1 of the most widely used and studied chemotherapeutic agents. It has clinical activity against several
malignancies, including acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), lymphoma, osteosarcoma, brain cancers, and head and
neck cancers.1 High-dose methotrexate (HDMTX), defined as a dose 1 g/m2, has been associated with severe toxicities
in as much as 10% of patients, with a mortality rate as high as 6% in early studies.2,3 With the institution of standardized
supportive care measures, including aggressive hydration, urine alkalinization, and leucovorin rescue, HDMTX now carries a much lower risk of severe toxicity. However, significant morbidity and mortality continue to be associated with
HDMTX-induced renal dysfunction.4-24
HDMTX-induced acute kidney injury and the resulting delay in methotrexate elimination can lead to prolonged
elevation of systemic methotrexate concentrations and serious toxicity, including myelosuppression, mucositis, and dermatitis.2 Several therapeutic interventions have been investigated for patients who experience HDMTX-induced acute
kidney injury. Pharmacokinetically guided leucovorin rescue is used routinely after HDMTX to counteract the effects of
methotrexate on normal cells.2,25-28 Although it has been reported that 13 patients who experienced extremely high methotrexate levels were treated successfully with high-dose leucovorin alone, with limited morbidity, and with recovery from
toxicity,29 another group reported that, of 3887 patients who received HDMTX, 1.8% developed acute kidney injury,
with a resulting mortality rate of 4.4%.7 Extracorporeal methods of methotrexate removal (peritoneal dialysis, hemodialysis, hemoperfusion, and plasmapheresis) have variable efficacy and are associated with numerous comorbidities; furthermore, methotrexate concentrations often rebound to toxic levels after extracorporeal therapy is stopped.2,7

Original Article

The use of the bacterial carboxypeptidase G class of
enzymes has demonstrated effectiveness in the treatment
of HDMTX-induced acute kidney injury.3-24 A recombinant form of bacterial carboxypeptidase, glucarpidase
(carboxypeptidase-G2 [CPDG2]) has been developed to
treat patients with HDMTX-induced acute kidney injury.
Glucarpidase hydrolytically cleaves the carboxyl-terminal
glutamate residue from extracellular folates and folate
analogues, forming the noncytotoxic metabolites 4-([2,4diamino-6-(pteridinyl)methyl]-methylamino)-benzoic
acid (DAMPA) and glutamic acid.3 It is reported that glucarpidase rapidly reduces systemic methotrexate concentrations by >95% within 1 hour of administration; and
unlike extracorporeal methods, it causes little rebound in
systemic methotrexate concentrations.5,8 Aside from allergic-type reactions, which occur in approximately 4% of
patients, glucarpidase has little treatment-related toxicity.3 This agent is available under an investigational new
drug treatment protocol for which safety information as
well as blood samples to determine antibody formation
are requested by the sponsor.
Despite the growing body of literature supporting
the use of glucarpidase as a rescue agent for HDMTXinduced acute kidney injury, few reports offer recommendations about the safety of resuming HDMTX therapy after administration of this agent.2-7 Many cancer treatment
protocols require multiple courses of HDMTX, and prognosis may be adversely affected when these courses are
delayed or omitted. Therefore, we reviewed the use of glucarpidase in a cohort of pediatric patients who received
HDMTX therapy and assessed the safety and tolerability
of resuming HDMTX after glucarpidase treatment.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients

After approval by the St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital (St. Jude) Institutional Review Board, we reviewed the
records of pediatric oncology patients who received
HDMTX (defined as 1 g/m2) with intravenous glucarpidase for HDMTX-induced acute kidney injury between
October 1, 1998 and December 31, 2010. All data were
obtained from the medical records of the identified
patients. These data included demographic information,
diagnosis, methotrexate dose, methotrexate plasma concentrations, glucarpidase dose, indicators of HDMTX
toxicity, and serum creatinine values.
Glucarpidase Administration

Glucarpidase was provided through various investigational new drug protocols and per-patient emergency use
4322

over the 12-year study period. After reconstitution with
normal saline, glucarpidase (protocol dose, 50 U/kg) was
administered intravenously over 5 minutes. The criteria
for administration of glucarpidase varied among protocols. All patients who received glucarpidase had an
increased serum creatinine concentration of 1.5 times
the baseline value. The plasma methotrexate concentration was >50 lM for all patients with osteosarcoma at 24
hours from the start of the methotrexate infusion. The
plasma methotrexate concentration was >10 lM at 42
hours from the start of the methotrexate infusion for all
other patients with the exception of 1, who had received
glucarpidase before the 42-hour methotrexate level. In the
event that a full glucarpidase dose was not available at the
time of enrollment, the total available dose was administered promptly, and the remainder was administered
upon procurement to equal a total dose of 50 U/kg. Supportive measures (hyperhydration, urine alkalinization
with intravenous sodium bicarbonate, and leucovorin rescue) were continued on the basis of plasma methotrexate
concentrations and renal function indicators. Written
informed consent was obtained from the parent or guardian and consent or assent was obtained from the patient as
appropriate before glucarpidase administration.
Methotrexate Toxicity

Methotrexate toxicity data for patients who were enrolled
on primary cancer treatment protocols were recovered from
previously compiled protocol databases and were graded by
using version 2.0, 3.0, or 4.0 of the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Toxicity Criteria, according the current version at the time of treatment. For patients who were
not enrolled on cancer treatment protocol, toxicity data
were obtained by chart review and were graded by using the
NCI Common Toxicity Criteria version 4.0.
Serum creatinine and urine output were monitored
at least daily until complete methotrexate excretion could
be confirmed or until acute kidney injury resolved. Acute
kidney injury was defined as a rise in serum creatinine to
>1.5 times the patient’s baseline serum creatinine value.
Recovery of renal function was defined as the return of
serum creatinine to 1.5 times the baseline serum creatinine value.
Methotrexate Assays and Pharmacokinetics

Blood samples were collected in ethylene diamine tetraacetic acid-containing tubes. The plasma was separated,
and plasma methotrexate concentrations were measured
locally within 1 hour of collection by using a commercially available fluorescence polarization immunoassay on
the TDx analyzer (Abbott Laboratories, Abbott Park, Ill).

High-Dose MTX After Glucarpidase/Christensen et al

In a subset of patients, remaining plasma was stored at
80 C for subsequent analysis by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) using a modification of the
sample-extraction procedure described by Steinborner
and Henion.30 Briefly, 500 lL of patient plasma were
mixed with 750 lL acetonitrile; 10 lL aminopterin and
N-10-trifluoroacetyl pteroic acid (Irvine Chemistry Laboratory, Anaheim, Calif) were added to the tube to serve as
the internal standard. The acetonitrile-plasma mixture
was agitated on a vortex mixer for 25 to 30 seconds and
then centrifuged. The liquid phase was mixed with 750
lL chloroform; then, the aqueous phase was transferred
to a separate tube and dried under nitrogen at room temperature. The dried samples were reconstituted in 100 lL
of mobile phase (3% acetonitrile in 10 mM sodium acetate, pH 5.0) and filtered through a 0.2-lm membrane
before injection onto the liquid chromatography system.
Plasma methotrexate or DAMPA concentrations
were measured on an Acquity H-Class ultra performance
liquid chromatography system (Waters, Milford, Mass).
Reconstituted patient samples, controls, or calibrators (20
lL) were injected into the system. The analytic column
was a Waters Acquity BEH C18 (2.1 mm  100 mm 
1.7 lm). The mobile phase gradient ran linearly from 3%
to 16% over 14 minutes (A [acetonitrile] and B [10 mM
sodium acetate, pH 5.0]). The total run time was 24
minutes, and the flow rate was 0.3 mL/minute. The column eluate was monitored for absorbance at 313 nm. The
retention time was 9.0 minutes for methotrexate, 13.1
minute for DAMPA, and 6.4 minutes and 8.0 minutes
for aminotpterin and N-10-(trifluoroacetyl)pteroic acid,
respectively. The dynamic range of the assay was from
0.01 lM to 10 lM.
The time to complete methotrexate excretion was
defined as the time elapsed between the start of the methotrexate infusion to the time at which the plasma methotrexate concentration fell below 0.1 lM or to the time at
which the last methotrexate concentration was obtained
for a given HDMTX course for patients whose last documented measurement was not <0.1 lM.
Methotrexate Dosing

The dose and infusion duration of methotrexate for each
patient was determined by the cancer diagnosis and therapeutic protocol. Patients with osteosarcoma received 12 g/
m2 methotrexate infused over 4 hours. Patients with nonlymphoblastic lymphoma received 8 g/m2 methotrexate
infused over 4 hours. Each patient’s physician had the discretion to deviate from these recommended regimens in
the event of methotrexate toxicity. For patients with ALL
Cancer

and lymphoblastic lymphoma who were treated on the
Total XV31 and Total XVI studies, each dose of HDMTX
was targeted to a steady-state plasma concentration of 65
lM based on the clearance of the previous course. The
adjusted HDMTX dose calculated by this targeting
method is referred to as the full recommended dosage in this
report.
Data Analysis

Descriptive statistics are used to characterize the study
group. Because of the non-normal distribution of data,
median values and ranges are reported.
RESULTS
Clinical Course of Glucarpidase Treatment

Twenty of 1141 patients (1.8%) who received HDMTX
at St. Jude received glucarpidase between October 1, 1998
and December 31, 2010. These patients had primary
diagnoses of ALL (n ¼ 10), osteosarcoma (n ¼ 6), B-cell
lymphoblastic lymphoma (n ¼ 2), relapsed Hodgkin lymphoma (n ¼ 1), and anaplastic large-cell lymphoma (n ¼
1). During the study period, 4909 courses of HDMTX
were administered; thus, 0.4% of HDMTX courses
required glucarpidase (Table 1). The HDMTX course
during which glucarpidase was administered ranged from
the first course through the eighth course of HDMTX
(median, third course).
Four patients received 2 glucarpidase doses; however, only 2 of those patients received the full recommended dosage of 50 U/kg twice. Because there was a
limited amount of glucarpidase immediately available, 2
patients received <50 U/kg and were given a ‘‘make-up’’
dose to complete the full recommended dosage within 48
hours of the first dose. The median initial glucarpidase
dose for all patients was 51.6 U/kg (range, 13.0-65.6 U/
kg). The median time from the start of the HDMTX infusion to administration of the first glucarpidase dose was
45.9 hours (range, 26.3-95 hours).
The median plasma methotrexate concentration was
138.0 lM (range, 29.2-462.9 lM) at 20 to 24 hours after
the start of the methotrexate infusion, and it was 29.1 lM
(range, 1.3-590.6 lM) before glucarpidase administration
as measured by the TDx analyzer. Glucarpidase administration resulted in a rapid decrease in methotrexate plasma
concentrations. The median percentage decrease in methotrexate after glucarpidase administration was 80%
(range, 61.9%-95.9%) as measured with the TDx analyzer by comparing the last plasma methotrexate concentration before glucarpidase and the first concentration
obtained after glucarpidase administration. For the 6

Thirteen patients were rechallenged with HDMTX after
receiving glucarpidase (Table 3). Two of the 20 patients
were not scheduled to receive further HDMTX as dictated
by their treatment plan, and 5 patients had all future
HDMTX courses omitted at the discretion of the treating
physician. Nine of the patients who were rechallenged
received a reduced HDMTX dose (dose reductions
ranged from 50% to 75% of the recommended HDMTX
dose), and 4 patients received the full recommended
HDMTX dose for the course immediately after glucarpidase (Fig. 2). Three of the 4 patients who received the full
recommended HDMTX dose were treated for ALL or
lymphoblastic lymphoma and, thus, had their dose targeted based on the clearance of their previous course.
Although those 3 patients received the full recommended
dose calculated in this way, the actual individualized
HDMTX dose received was 33%, 68%, and 75% of the
dose administered during the glucarpidase course, because

During the HDMTX course during which patients
received glucarpidase, 7 patients experienced a grade 3 or
4 serum creatinine increase (>3 times the upper limit of
normal) (Table 2). All patients had at least a doubling of
serum creatinine from baseline. One patient developed
oliguria concomitantly with acute kidney injury, whereas
all other patients maintained urine output >1 mL/kg per
hour. One patient received hemodialysis for electrolyte
abnormalities. Two patients developed grade 4 neutropenia (absolute neutrophil count <500/mm3), and 1 patient
developed grade 3 neutropenia (absolute neutrophil count
500-1000/mm3). Four patients had a grade 3 infection
requiring intravenous antibiotics. One patient experienced grade 3 mucositis. There were no treatment-related
deaths.

Figure 2. The disposition of 20 patients who received glucarpidase is illustrated according to whether they were rechallenged
with HDMTX after they received glucarpidase, whether they received the full recommended HDMTX dose or a reduced dose for
the course immediately after glucarpidase, and whether the full recommended dose ever was given. An asterisk indicates that
HDMTX doses for patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia and patients with lymphoblastic lymphoma were targeted to a
steady-state concentration of 65 lM based on clearance of the previous HDMTX course. A full dose was defined as the administration of the recommended targeted dose.

the calculation of each recommended dose depended
heavily on the methotrexate clearance during previous
courses. One patient with osteosarcoma received the full
recommended 12 g/m2 HDMTX dose for the next course
after glucarpidase. All patients had serum creatinine values
return to the normal range for their age before they were
rechallenged with HDMTX. The median time to
HDMTX rechallenge, defined as the time elapsed
between the start of the HDMTX course in which glucarpidase was administered and the start of the next
HDMTX infusion, was 28 days (range, 18-70 days). All
patients who were rechallenged were admitted the evening
before the next HDMTX course for prehydration and had
the rate of intravenous hydration and subsequent leucovorin dosing adjusted by a clinical pharmacist.

hours (range, 66-268 hours). The 13 patients who were
rechallenged with HDMTX received a total of 39
HDMTX courses after glucarpidase (1-6 courses per
patient) (Table 3). These methotrexate doses ranged from
50% to 100% of the recommended dose. For all other
additional HDMTX courses after the initial rechallenge,
the median peak serum creatinine level was 0.6 mg/dL
(range, 0.4-0.9 mg/dL), or 22.5% over baseline values
(range, 0%-50%). All but 2 patients who were rechallenged either completed all recommended courses of
HDMTX or were scheduled to do so at the time of analysis. One patient experienced renal dysfunction and
delayed methotrexate elimination upon rechallenge with
HDMTX, and another patient experienced neurotoxicity
that was unrelated to renal dysfunction. None of the
patients required further glucarpidase with subsequent
HDMTX courses.

Figure 3. The range of methotrexate (MTX) plasma concentration (Conc.) is illustrated for patients during the high-dose MTX
(HDMTX) course in which they received glucarpidase (red), during the next HDMTX course after glucarpidase (green), and for
the expected range for the dose received (blue). Colored regions represent the range of MTX concentrations for (a) patients who
received a 24-hour infusion of 5 g/m2 of MTX or a dose targeted to an MTX steady-state concentration of 65 lM and (b) patients
who received a 4-hour infusion of 8 to 12 g/m2 of MTX. MTX doses may have been reduced for the first course after glucarpidase.
Each set of 2 graphs illustrates data for periods of (Left) 96 hours and (Right) 700 hours. The expected ranges for dose were
obtained from the pharmacokinetic data for previous cohorts of St. Jude patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia and
osteosarcoma.

resuming HDMTX therapy in patients who have received
glucarpidase for HDMTX-induced acute kidney injury.
HDMTX-induced acute kidney injury can cause prolonged elevation of systemic methotrexate concentrations
and potentially can cause serious toxicity.1 The cornerstones of prevention and control of HDMTX-induced
acute kidney injury are aggressive hydration and alkalinization. When these methods fail to prevent the occurrence
of acute kidney injury, glucarpidase provides a method of
reducing plasma methotrexate concentrations quickly and
safely. The incidence observed in our population (1.8%)
is similar to that previously reported in the osteosarcoma
population.7 Widemann et al20 reported that delaying the
administration of glucarpidase >96 hours from the start
of the HDMTX infusion may increase the risk of grade 4
and 5 toxicity. All of our 20 patients received glucarpidase
4328

within 96 hours (median, 45.9 hours; range, 26.3-95.0
hours) after the start of the methotrexate infusion. Renal
function eventually recovered to baseline in all patients,
and no patient died as a result of methotrexate toxicity.
It is known that the measurement of plasma methotrexate using the TDx analyzer overestimates the methotrexate concentration because of the cross reactivity of
methotrexate with its metabolite DAMPA.5,8 For research
purposes, methotrexate was assayed in a subset of our 20
patients by HPLC, and these results indicated that plasma
methotrexate was reduced >99% by glucarpidase (Fig. 1).
However, in the absence of an HPLC assay, commercial
methods can be used to guide the duration of leucovorin
rescue, because DAMPA metabolite levels become insignificant as the plasma methotrexate concentration
approaches 0.1 lM (Fig. 1).

High-Dose MTX After Glucarpidase/Christensen et al

Previous experience to guide the resumption of
HDMTX after glucarpidase administration for
HDMTX-induced acute kidney injury is limited to case
reports and 1 case series.6 In the largest group to date, 13
of our 20 patients who received glucarpidase were rechallenged with HDMTX at doses ranging from 50% to
100% of the full dose. In patients with leukemia, doses
ranged from 50% to 100% of the recommended
HDMTX dose. Three of 5 patients with leukemia who
tolerated a reduced dose subsequently received full recommended HDMTX dose. In patients with osteosarcoma,
rechallenge doses again ranged from 50% to 100% of the
recommended full dose. Two of these patients who were
rechallenged with a reduced HDMTX dose tolerated the
full dose during the next course, whereas 1 patient again
experienced delayed elimination and was not rechallenged
further. Two rechallenged patients had B-lineage lymphoblastic lymphoma and were treated according to the St.
Jude Total XV ALL protocol, in which the HDMTX dose
was individualized on the basis of systemic clearance. One
of these patients resumed the full dose of HDMTX immediately after glucarpidase, whereas the other resumed the
full dose after a single reduced-dose cycle.
Eleven of 13 patients who were rechallenged with
HDMTX tolerated the therapy well (Table 3). The clearance profile of methotrexate for the course immediately
after glucarpidase administration more closely resembled
that of the expected clearance of methotrexate (Fig. 3).
The median time to complete methotrexate excretion fell
from 355 hours during the course in which glucarpidase
was required, to 90 hours for the course immediately after
glucarpidase, and then to 72 hours for all subsequent
courses. In historic controls, the complete methotrexate
elimination time after HDMTX was 66 to 72 hours.
These results demonstrate that methotrexate elimination
recovers to baseline as renal function recovers.
In conclusion, the use of glucarpidase is a strategy to
effectively rescue patients with HDMTX-induced acute
kidney injury and is associated with complete renal recovery. The resumption of HDMTX after glucarpidase
administration was well tolerated, although close monitoring of both renal function and plasma methotrexate
levels was necessary.
