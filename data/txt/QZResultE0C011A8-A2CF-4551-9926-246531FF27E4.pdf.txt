ABSTRACT:
There is a growing body of evidence supporting the use of epigenetic therapies
in the treatment of multiple myeloma. We show the novel HDAC inhibitor CHR3996 induces apoptosis in myeloma cells at concentrations in the nanomolar range
and with apoptosis mediated by p53 and caspase pathways. In addition, HDAC
inhibitors are highly synergistic, both in vitro and in vivo, with the aminopeptidase
inhibitor tosedostat (CHR-2797). We demonstrate that the basis for this synergy is
a consequence of changes in the levels of NFκB regulators BIRC3/cIAP2, A20, CYLD,
and IκB, which were markedly affected by the combination. When co-administered the
HDAC and aminopeptidase inhibitors caused rapid nuclear translocation of NFκB family
members p65 and p52, following activation of both canonical and non-canonical NFκB
signalling pathways. The subsequent up-regulation of inhibitors of NFκB activation
(most significantly BIRC3/cIAP2) turned off the cytoprotective effects of the NFκB
signalling response in a negative feedback loop. These results provide a rationale
for combining HDAC and aminopeptidase inhibitors clinically for the treatment of
myeloma patients and support the disruption of the NFκB signalling pathway as a
therapeutic strategy.

INTRODUCTION

Histone deacetylases (HDACs) are one of the best
characterised components of the epigenetic machinery
and encompasses a family of 18 members [3]. A major
function of HDACs is to catalyse the removal of acetyl
groups from histone tails which, in concert with other
epigenetic mechanisms, promotes the condensation of
DNA into transcriptionally inactive heterochromatin
[4]. In addition to targeting histones, the de-acetylating
activity of HDACs also affects numerous non-histone
targets. These acetylated proteins or the ‘acetylome’
include transcription factors p53 [5, 6], STAT3 [7, 8], and
the NFκB family member p65 [9-11], a target that may
be of particular relevance in myeloma cells which are
recognised as being highly dependent on NFκB signalling
[12]. Furthermore, HDAC6 has been shown to regulate
the processing of misfolded proteins via the aggresome

Despite the recent introduction of novel therapies
for the treatment of the plasma cell malignancy multiple
myeloma, it remains an almost incurable disease with a
high rate of relapse. At relapse the clonal cells are often
resistant to standard therapies and there is a clinical need
to develop novel therapeutic combinations. Epigenetic
processes such as DNA methylation and regulation of
chromatin structure are now considered to make an
important contribution to gene regulation, oncogenic
transformation and survival of neoplastic cells in a wide
range of malignancies including myeloma [1, 2]. These
epigenetic changes can be targeted therapeutically and
there is a growing body of early data supporting the
clinical efficacy of epigenetic therapies in myeloma [2].

pathway [13, 14], a process that is particularly important
to myeloma cells which have to cope with a significant
load of unfolded immunoglobulin[15, 16]. These diverse
roles of HDACs imply that cell death resulting from their
inhibition is likely to be multi-factorial and depend upon
the selective activity of the inhibitor used against the
different HDAC family members.
Recently developed HDAC inhibitors, such as
vorinostat, panobinostat, and romidepsin have shown
some promising anti-tumour activities in multiple
myeloma but only modest effects in the clinical setting
[17-19]. Combination studies in a number of clinical trials
also support the use of HDAC inhibitors with other antitumour agents such as bortezomib [20], but dose limiting
toxicities are frequently observed and efficacy needs to
be improved. A better understanding of the mechanisms
of HDAC inhibitors is required to overcome the current
challenges in single and combination strategies, while new
HDAC inhibitors and novel combination strategies may
result in toxicity reduction and better patient outcomes.
In this study we describe the effects of a novel
HDAC inhibitor, CHR-3996, on myeloma cells. CHR3996 demonstrates HDAC inhibitory activity at low
concentrations with minimal activity against HDAC6
function and the aggresome pathway [21]. We show
that this HDAC inhibitor is highly efficacious against
myeloma cells, inducing apoptosis via its effects on the
acetylome, and go on to demonstrate that it is highly
synergistic when combined with the aminopeptidase
inhibitor tosedostat (CHR-2797) [22], which we have
previously shown to have potent anti-myeloma activity in
vitro and in vivo [23, 24]. Aminopeptidase inhibitors act
downstream of the proteasome, catalysing the breakdown
of proteasome generated peptides into their constituent
amino acids. However, unlike proteasome inhibitors, the
inhibition of aminopeptidases does not result in the toxic
build-up of misfolded/aggregated proteins, so they have
a different biological impact to proteasome inhibitors.
Inhibiting aminopeptidases has been shown to starve the
cell of essential amino acids and trigger the amino acid
deprivation response [22, 23]. The combination of these
compounds leads to rapid activation of NFκB signalling
and a subsequent induction of a negative feedback loop,
mediated via NFκB regulators such as BIRC3, resulting in
myeloma cell death.

the various cell lines treated with CHR-3996 ranged
from 30.3-97.6nM. In comparison to two commercially
available HDAC inhibitors, SAHA and Sodium Valproate,
CHR-3996 was shown to be effective at much lower
concentrations and was approximately 10-fold more
potent than SAHA and 10-thousand fold more potent than
Sodium Valproate (Supplementary Table 1). For further
experiments in two cell lines with different translocations,
H929 t(4;14) and RPMI-8226 t(16;22), both associated
in patients with poor prognoses and needing alternate
therapeutic strategies, were selected and treated with
CHR-3996. To ascertain whether CHR-3996 is cytostatic
or cytotoxic, these cell lines were treated with CHR-3996
and the percentage of cells undergoing apoptosis was
determined (Figure 1B). The percentage of viable cells
decreased to around 50% in both cell lines and there was
a concomitant increase in early and late apoptotic cells
indicating that CHR-3996 induces cell death. CD138+
plasma cells isolated from myeloma patients were also
sensitive in a WST-1 assay to CHR-3996 treatment at
doses comparable to MM cell lines (average=18nM)
(Figure 1C). CHR-3996 also induced apoptosis in
primary patient cells in a dose-dependent manner: 24
hours following treatment there was an increase in the
percentage of cells in early apoptosis and at 48 hours there
was more than a two-fold increase in the percentage of
both early and late apoptotic cells compared to untreated
cells (Figure 1D).

CHR-3996 induces apoptosis via p53-dependent
pathways and caspase activation
HDAC inhibitors have been widely reported to arrest
cell cycle progression and up-regulate cyclin dependent
kinase (cdk) inhibitors such as CDKN1A (p21) expression
[25]. To test whether CHR-3996 has similar effects in
myeloma cells, H929 and RPMI-8226 cells were treated
with CHR-3996 and PI binding was used to determine the
cellular DNA content (Figure 2A). There was evidence of
a G0/G1 block in cell cycle progression; the percentage of
H929 cells in G1 remained at 48%, whilst the percentage
of cells in S and G2/M phase decreased from 21 to 10%
and 22 to 3.5% respectively. Likewise for RPMI-8226
cells the percentage of cells in S phase fell from 30 to 25%
and G2/M from 26 to 16%. Additionally, both myeloma
cell lines demonstrated an increase in the percentage of
cells in the subG0/G1 fraction (H929 from 5.8 to 35.6%,
RPMI-8226 from 5.3 to 18.7%), indicating that drug
treatment induced apoptosis.
Apoptosis in response to CHR-3996 was shown
to occur mainly via caspase-dependent mechanisms
(Figure 2B). The pro-apoptotic DNase EndonucleaseG
was up-regulated, as was the p53 down-stream mediator
Noxa (Figure 2B). Treatment of H929 and RPMI-8226
cells led to the cleavage of caspase 9 with minimal

Figure 1: CHR-3996 inhibits the proliferation of myeloma cells and induces apoptosis. A. A panel of myeloma cell lines

were treated with a range of concentrations of CHR-3996 (i), SAHA (ii), or Sodium (Na) Valproate (iii) for 48 hours. The proliferation of
the cells was monitored by metabolic activity (WST-1 assay) and is shown as a percentage of untreated cells. The LC50 for each cell line
is shown in Supplementary table 1. B. H929 and RPMI-8226 cells were treated with CHR-3996 (250 nM and 100 nM respectively) for
8, 24, or 48 hours. Apoptosis was analysed by Annexin-FITC/propidium iodide (PI) staining and analysis by flow cytometry (AnnexinV
positive is defined as early apoptotic, AnnexinV and PI positive as late apoptotic) and by trypan blue exclusion. C. Primary CD138+ plasma
cells from three patients were treated with a range of concentrations of CHR-3996 and the proliferation measured by WST-1 assay. D.
Primary patient CD138+ plasma cells were treated with either 50 or 100 nM CHR-3996 over a time-course of 48 hours. The percentage
of cells undergoing apoptosis was determined by binding of AnnexinV and PI followed by analysis by flow cytometry. Results from a
representative patient are shown.

involvement of the extrinsic apoptosis mediator caspase
8. The demonstration of caspase 9 cleavage indicates
that activation of the proteolytic pathway is a hallmark
of CHR-3996 induced apoptosis. To further clarify the
role of caspases in cell death, H929 cells were pre-treated
with the pan-caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-FMK 1.5 hours
prior to exposure to CHR-3996. Following 24 hours
there was a dose-dependent increase in the percentage of
cells undergoing apoptosis in the presence of CHR-3996;
however this was largely inhibited by pre-treatment with
Z-VAD-FMK (Figure 2C). At the highest concentration
of CHR-3996 (750 nM) 35% of cells were apoptotic
whereas this was reduced to 13.9% following addition of
Z-VAD-FMK, only slightly higher than baseline levels of
apoptosis without CHR-3996 treatment (8.5%).

myeloma cell lines were grown in the presence of bone
marrow stromal cells. The bone marrow stromal cells
themselves did not show altered proliferation in response
to a range of CHR-3996 concentrations up to 2.5 µM
(Figure 3A), but the myeloma cell lines H929 and RPMI8226 remained highly sensitive to CHR-3996 showing no
difference in cell viability across a range of doses in the
presence or absence of bone marrow stromal cells (Figure
3B). Although CHR-3996 did not induce apoptosis in bone
marrow stromal cells, there was a significant reduction in
the levels of IL-6 and VEGF they secreted (Figure 3C-3D)
that decreased in a dose-dependent manner. Since IL-6 and
VEGF are secreted by both myeloma and stromal cells, we
studied the level of IL-6 and VEGF in co-culture media. In
untreated co-culture conditions, the variations observed in
cytokine secretion between co-culture samples reflect the
varied ability of different stroma cell samples to induce
cytokine production from MM cell lines. This observation
supports the hypothesis that myeloma survival is largely
dependent on the bone marrow microenvironment. Similar
reductions in levels of both cytokines were observed in
the culture media when bone marrow stromal cells were

disruption to aggresomes [13]. There was no determinable
effect of CHR-3996 on the levels of acetylated α-tubulin
or ubiquitinated proteins in myeloma cell lines H929 and
RPMI-8226 (Figure 4B), indicating low activity of this
compound against HDAC6. There was also no effect on
the chymotryptic proteasome activity (Figure 4C). In
contrast, Bortezomib, a well-characterised proteasome
inhibitor, effectively inhibited proteasome activity by
around 80% and concomitantly increased the levels of
ubiquitinated cellular protein in both myeloma cell lines
(Figure 4B-4C).

cgi?acc=GSE20405) (Supplementary Table 2).
Treating the cells with the HDAC inhibitor affected
the expression of numerous genes, a large proportion
of which were involved in the regulation of cell cycle.
Inhibitors of cyclin dependent kinases and genes mediating
DNA damage-induced cell cycle arrest increased in
expression, while genes stimulating initiation of mitosis
and progression of cell cycle decreased. There were
also changes observed in the level of expression of key
regulators of the NFκB signalling pathway BIRC3, CYLD,
TRAF1 and BCMA. The expression changes seen support
the presence of increased p53 signalling, as evidenced
by alterations in expression of p53 regulated genes, in
addition to which negative inhibitors of p53, such as
MDM2, decreased following HDAC inhibitor treatment.
Increases in the expression of key mediators of stress
signalling, such as PERK, CHOP and IRE-1 indicate the
cells experienced higher levels of endoplasmic reticulum
mediated cellular stress following HDAC inhibition.
The induction of apoptosis was reflected in increases in

PUMA, FOXO3 and APAF1, together with a decrease in
the anti-apoptotic protein BIRC5 (survivin). CHR-3996
appears to down-regulate the pro-survival Wnt signalling
pathway because inhibitors of Wnt signalling were more
highly expressed after exposure to this compound. There
is also evidence that the process of autophagy was upregulated as indicated by the increased expression of

LC3B, APG5 and -10. Interestingly, there were also
changes seen in the expression of chromatin modifying
enzymes including increased HDAC5 and -9, possibly a
reflection of the cells trying to overcome the deleterious
effects of the HDAC inhibitor.

CHR-3996 is synergistic with an aminopeptidase
inhibitor in vitro

when the aminopeptidase inhibitor was added prior to the
HDAC inhibitor (Figure 5A). Although in vitro studies
showed a more profound effect, sequential dosing was
not studied in vivo due to the pharmacokinetic properties
of the two compounds meaning daily administration of
both compounds was required, making sequential dosing
difficult.

Building effective clinical combinations in vitro is
an important aim of translational drug development and in
order to investigate whether CHR-3996 is more effective
as part of a combination therapy, H929 and RPMI-8226
cells were treated with CHR-3996 together with either
melphalan or bortezomib. A full Chou-Talalay analysis
with 16 points on the curve revealed that while there
was low level synergy with melphalan (a CI of around
0.7 in both cell lines), the combination of CHR-3996 and
bortezomib was not synergistic (a CI of 1.3 for both cell
lines). In a search for an agent giving rise to high level
synergy we went on to examine the combination with an
aminopeptidase inhibitor, tosedostat (CHR-2797), which
we have recently shown to have potent anti-myeloma
activity in vitro and in vivo [23, 24]. When CHR-3996 or
two other widely studied HDAC inhibitors (SAHA and
Sodium Valproate) were added to cell lines concomitantly
with tosedostat the agents were highly synergistic
(<0.7); an effect that became more profound when the
aminopeptidase inhibitor was added to the cells 24 hours
prior to the HDAC inhibitor (>0.4) (Supplementary Table
3). However, if the HDAC inhibitor was added prior to
the tosedostat a smaller degree of synergy was observed
and in some cases became antagonistic, suggesting the
aminopeptidase inhibitor is sensitizing the cells to the
effects of the HDAC inhibitor.

The combination of CHR-3996 with an
aminopeptidase inhibitor affects NFκB signalling
In order to understand the basis of the synergy we
have demonstrated, H929 cells were treated with CHR3996, tosedostat, or a combination of the two for 24 hours,
then RNA extracted for global gene expression analysis.
The largest fold changes in expression observed were
those of negative NFκB regulators BIRC3, IκBα, A20,
and CYLD (Table 1), suggesting that the combination
may effectively target the NFκB pathway. To further
investigate the effects of the HDAC and aminopeptidase
inhibitors on NFκB signalling, immunoblotting was
performed to analyse the phosphorylation status and
localisation of key proteins in this pathway. Exposure
of H929 cells to tosedostat alone and in combination
with the HDAC inhibitor led to the activation of the
canonical NFκB signalling pathway, demonstrated by
increased IκBα phosphorylation and p65 translocation
to the nucleus, and the non-canonical NFκB signalling
pathway, shown by the proteolytic cleavage of p100
into the active form p52 (and its subsequent nuclear
translocation) (Figure 5B). Treatment with CHR-3996
in isolation led to a modest increase in nuclear p65
(associated with decreased cytoplasmic levels of IκBα
rather than IκBα phosphorylation) and a small increase in
nuclear p52 detected, suggesting that the HDAC inhibitor
alone has minimal impact on canonical or non-canonical
NFκB activation (Figure 5B). Comparing tosedostat
alone with the combination, the presence of the HDAC
inhibitor led to a more rapid phosphorylation of IκB and
nuclear translocation of p65 and p52, consistent with the
faster activation of canonical and non-canonical NFκB
pathways. However, by 12 hours there was a significant
up-regulation of BIRC3/cIAP2 – an effect not seen with

CHR-3996 is synergistic with an aminopeptidase
inhibitor in vivo
Administration of CHR-3996 in a NOD/SCID
IL2R gammanull xenograft model effectively inhibited
tumour growth at doses that were well tolerated (Figure
5A). To interrogate whether the HDAC inhibitor and
aminopeptidase inhibitor were synergistic as observed
in vitro, doses of each agent were chosen that partially
inhibited tumour growth (CHR-3996 30 mg/kg, tosedostat
75 mg/kg). These compounds were co-administered over
a maximum of 28 days. Each agent in isolation slowed
tumour growth but completely blocked tumour growth

either compound alone – which was associated with
subsequent decreases in IκBα phosphorylation, p65 and
p52 nuclear translocation (Figure 5B). To further confirm
these data, a DNA binding assay was performed to
determine whether p65 and p52 detected in the nuclear
fraction represented active transcription factors. Verifying
the immunoblotting results, the HDAC inhibitor alone had
a very small effect of levels of nuclear p65 and p52, whilst
exposure to the aminopeptidase inhibitor increased the
amount of p65 (Figure 5Ci) and p52 (Figure 5Cii) able to
bind the NFκB consensus oligonucleotide sequence over
24 hours. When combined with the HDAC inhibitor the
amount of active p65 and p52 in the nucleus increased
more rapidly than following tosedostat treatment alone,
but declined following 8 hours of treatment, confirming
the results seen by immunoblotting.

it has oral bioavailability making it useful clinically and
early Phase I trial data show it is well-tolerated [21].
Combination studies also support the use of HDAC
inhibitors with other agents, with a number of studies
showing promising anti-tumour activities [20, 38].
Targeting the proteotoxic stress is a potential treatment
strategy in myeloma and combining bortezomib with
inducers of protein misfolding promotes apoptosis in
myeloma cells [40]. Previous laboratory investigations
have demonstrated a synergistic relationship between
various HDAC inhibitors – including tubacin [14], SAHA
[41], and LBH589 [32] – with the proteasome inhibitor
bortezomib. Like the majority of HDAC inhibitors these
inhibitors either have broad spectrum activity or, as in the
case of tubacin, activity specifically targeting HDAC6,
and, therefore, inhibit the aggresome pathway [42]. Like
bortezomib, they interfere with the cellular mechanisms
for dealing with misfolded proteins, providing a rationale
for their synergy [43]. The HDAC inhibitor described
here, CHR-3996, has very low HDAC6 inhibitory activity
therefore would not be expected to inhibit the aggresome
pathway. In keeping with this, it was not found to be
synergistic with bortezomib. A study of another HDAC
inhibitor with a similar low HDAC6 inhibitory activity,
R306465 [44], also described a lack of synergy between
these agents.
Interestingly, in this study we have described a
high degree of synergy both in vitro and in vivo between
CHR-3996 and the aminopeptidase inhibitor tosedostat
(CHR-2797). To further investigate the cellular basis of
the synergy between these HDAC and aminopeptidase
inhibitors we used expression profiling and found that
the combination particularly affects level of expression
of NFκB regulators. We have shown that while
exposure to the HDAC inhibitor had minimal effects
on p65 or p52 activation and nuclear translocation, the
aminopeptidase inhibitor alone and in combination with
the HDAC inhibitor strongly activates both canonical
and non-canonical signalling pathways. NFκB is a key
cancer driver and the activation of the NFκB pathway
is generally thought to be associated with increased cell
survival, opposing apoptosis in a wide range of cancers.
Targeting the NFκB pathway is shown to be an effective
strategy in both solid and haematological malignancies
[45, 46]. However recent data counter this contention
and indicate that, like our compounds, the anti-myeloma
agent bortezomib and other proteasome inhibitors also
activate NFκB signalling in myeloma cell lines [47].
Whether this increase in NFκB activity contributes to
the apoptotic process or is a cytoprotective response
triggered to protect the cell from programmed cell death
has not been elucidated. NFκB activation is a self-limiting
process mediated via a negative feedback mechanism;
activation of this pathway up-regulates the expression of
its own negative regulators. When the aminopeptidase and
HDAC inhibitors are combined the activation of NFκB

DISCUSSION
In this study we have shown that the HDAC
inhibitor, CHR-3996, has anti-myeloma activity at low
concentrations, leading to cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in
myeloma cell lines and primary patients cells. CHR-3996
induced apoptosis was shown to be largely dependent on
caspase activation and overcame the protective effects of
bone marrow stromal cells. Whilst no loss of bone marrow
stromal cell viability was observed, the amount of promyeloma cytokines IL-6 and VEGF secreted decreased
significantly. Numerous other HDAC inhibitors have been
shown to have anti-myeloma activities, including Sodium
Valproate [29], Sodium Butyrate [25], Trichostatin A
(TSA) [25], SAHA [30], FR901228 (depsipeptide) [31],
LBH589 [32], PXD101 [33], ITF2357 [34], KD5170 [35],
tubacin [14], and NVP-LAQ824 [36]. Many of these data
are in agreement with our results, showing that HDAC
inhibitors induce apoptosis in myeloma cells, however,
the mechanism for this remains controversial. The
HDAC inhibitors LBH589, NVP-LAQ824, and KD5170
demonstrated similar findings to CHR-3996 and were
found to induce cell death via activation of the caspase
pathway with the pan-caspase inhibitor protecting the
myeloma cell lines from apoptosis [32, 35, 36]. However,
the HDAC inhibitors SAHA and TSA were shown to
regulate cell death by caspase-independent mechanisms
[30, 37]. Apoptosis has also been linked to oxidative stress
and DNA damage [35], mitochondrial disruption [35, 37],
up-regulation and release of pro-apoptotic factors such as
Bax and NOXA and Bim [25, 37, 38], down-regulation
of anti-apoptotic factors [31, 37], and sensitisation to
TRAIL-induced cell death [30]. Levels of the cytokines
IL-6 and VEGF, secreted by the myeloma cells and the
surrounding bone marrow stromal cells, are reduced by
numerous HDAC inhibitors [25, 29, 30, 32, 39] which is
in line with results from our experiments. Importantly,
and in comparison to other HDAC inhibitors, CHR-3996
is potent, acting in the low nanomolar range. In addition

signalling is more rapid but is followed by increased
expression of the NFκB regulators IκBα, A20, CYLD, and
most markedly BIRC3. The strong induction of BIRC3 is
associated with a decline in the levels of phosphorylated
IκBα and active NFκB family members detectable in the
nuclear compartment. Based upon these results we suggest
that the presence of the HDAC inhibitor effectively turns
off the cytoprotective NFκB response initially triggered
by exposure to the aminopeptidase inhibitor, explaining
why they are more effective when co-administered. Our
data indicate that increased expression of NFκB regulators
have an anti-myeloma effect, and this is supported by the
high frequency of inactivating mutations found in these
regulators (BIRC3, Traf2/3 and CYLD) in myeloma
patients [48-51]. These mutations are associated with
high levels of NIK activation and non-canonical NFκB
signalling. Future work by gene expression profiling and
testing the effect of these molecules in patient samples
with such mutations would be useful to further confirm
the mechanism of synergy.
In conclusion, the HDAC inhibitor CHR-3996
has been demonstrated to have potent anti-myeloma
activity and is highly synergistic when combined with
the aminopeptidase inhibitor tosedostat (CHR-2797),
providing a good rationale for clinically combining
these agents. Based on this work a phase I dose finding
study of the two oral medications has been initiated.
The combination of these compounds leads to rapid
NFκB activation which is followed by induction of
a negative feedback mechanism, the up-regulated
expression of repressors of NFκB signalling, switching
the cytoprotective response off. This suggests that the
repressed expression of NFκB inhibitors like A20, CYLD,
IκBα and BIRC3 is an important mechanism of myeloma
cell survival, and confirms the central role of NFκB
signalling in myeloma pathogenesis.

Proteasome assay

Xenograft murine model

Cells were lysed on ice for 20 minutes in lysis
buffer (20mM TrisHCl, 150mM NaCl, 1mM EDTA, 1mM
EGTA, 1% Triton, supplemented with 1x protease inhibitor
cocktail (Roche, Germany). The protein concentration
was determined by BCA assay (Pierce, UK) and 25 µg
of protein was mixed with substrate for the chymotryptic
activity of the proteasome (Suc-Leu-Leu-Val-Tyr-AMC at
75 µM). The fluorescence (using 355nM excitation and
460nM emission wavelengths) was measured on a Mithras
LB940 plate reader (Berthold Technologies, Germany).
Data from each well was collected over a 1 second period,
repeating the measurement every 120 seconds for a total
of 48 measurements performed at 37ºC.

A breeding colony of NOD/SCID IL2R gammanull
(obtained from The Jackson Laboratory, USA) were
housed and monitored at the Biomedical Science Unit
at the Institute of Cancer Research. All experimental
procedures and protocols have been approved by local
ethical review at the Institute of Cancer Research and the
Home Office. The mice were inoculated subcutaneously
in the right flank with 2x106 H929 myeloma cells in 50 µL
RPMI-1640 and 50 µL MatrigelTM Basement Membrane
Matrix Growth Factor Reduced (Becton Dickinson). The
mice were assigned into the following four treatment
groups (10 animals per group): no treatment, tosedostat
75 mg/kg, CHR-3996 30 mg/kg, and tosedostat 75
mg/kg with concomitant CHR-3996 30 mg/kg. Both
compounds were administered daily beginning four
days after the tumour cells were inoculated; tosedostat
by intra-peritoneal injection and CHR-3996 per oral.
Caliper measurements of the longest perpendicular tumour
diameters (length) and width were performed every other
day to estimate the tumour volume using the following
formula representing the 3D volume of an ellipse: 1/2 x
(length) x (width)2.

Gene expression studies
RNA was extracted from cells with the RNeasy Plus
Mini kit (Qiagen, UK). RNA quality and quantity was
determined using a 2100 Bio-analyser (Agilent, USA). For
microarray experiments 100 ng total RNA was amplified
using a 2-cycle target biotin labelling kit (Affymetrix,
USA) and cRNA was hybridized to Human Genome U133
Plus 2.0 expression arrays. The arrays were washed on
an Affymetrix Fluidics Station 450 and scanned with a
Gene Chip Scanner 3000. Normalization and data analysis
was performed using dChip software (http://www.dchip.
org/). Supervised analysis was performed using dChip to
determine genes differentially expressed in the control (C)
or treated (T) cells. Comparison criteria used were: C/T
fold difference (greater or lower) is equal or greater than
2x mean difference T-C or C-T is greater than 100, p value
is less than 0.05.
