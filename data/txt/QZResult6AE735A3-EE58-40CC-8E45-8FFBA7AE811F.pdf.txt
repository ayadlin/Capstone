ABSTRACT
The B-cell receptor (BCR) signaling pathway has gained significant attention as
a therapeutic target in B-cell malignancies. Recently, several drugs that target the
BCR signaling pathway, especially the Btk inhibitor ibrutinib, have demonstrated
notable therapeutic effects in relapsed/refractory patients, which indicates that
pharmacological inhibition of BCR pathway holds promise in B-cell lymphoma
treatment. Here we present a novel covalent irreversible Btk inhibitor PLS-123 with
more potent anti-proliferative activity compared with ibrutinib in multiple cellular
and in vivo models through effective apoptosis induction and dual-action inhibitory
mode of Btk activation. The phosphorylation of BCR downstream activating AKT/mTOR
and MAPK signal pathways was also more significantly reduced after treatment with
PLS-123 than ibrutinib. Gene expression profile analysis further suggested that the
different selectivity profile of PLS-123 led to significant downregulation of oncogenic
gene PTPN11 expression, which might also offer new opportunities beyond what
ibrutinib has achieved. In addition, PLS-123 dose-dependently attenuated BCR- and
chemokine-mediated lymphoma cell adhesion and migration. Taken together, Btk
inhibitor PLS-123 suggested a new direction to pharmacologically modulate Btk
function and develop novel therapeutic drug for B-cell lymphoma treatment.

INTRODUCTION

cases are diagnosed per 100,000 people per year, and
B-cell lymphoma accounts for approximately 66% of these
patients. Patient prognosis has been significantly improved
by combination immunotherapy and rituximab; however,
approximately 1/3 of late-phase patients still develop
primary and secondary resistance to the chemotherapy [2].
Therefore, the development of new targeted drugs for the

B-cell lymphoma is characterized by the malignant
growth of B-lymphocytes in the lymph system and
comprises various subtypes with distinct pathological
characteristics, clinical features and prognoses [1]. In
China, approximately 5-6 new lymphatic malignancy

treatment of this debilitating disease is urgently needed.
The BCR signaling pathway has gained significant
attention owing to its essential role in the pathogenesis
of B-cell lymphoid malignancies [3]. BCR signaling
transduction is initiated upon stimulation of the BCR
complex, which is composed of surface immunoglobulin
and two associated proteins: CD79A (Igα) and CD79B
(Igβ). The CD79A and CD79B ITAM domains are
phosphorylated by the Src-family kinases upon
membrane-bound antigen stimulation, which triggers
the phosphorylation and activation of regulatory and
adaptor proteins, including Syk, Btk and B-cell linker
(BLNK). BCR-mediated phosphorylation of the Tyr551
residue in Btk results in a 10-fold increase in Btk’s
catalytic activity. Then, this form of Btk undergoes autophosphorylation at Tyr223 to become fully activated.
Once fully activated, Btk phosphorylates its substrates
phospholipase C-γ2 (PLC-γ2) leading to the induction
of downstream pathways, such as NF-κB, extracellular
signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and NF-AT, which regulate
B cell proliferation, differentiation, and migration [4].
Recently, several drugs targeting BCR signal, especially
the Btk inhibitor ibrutinib (PCI-32765), have clearly
demonstrated promising therapeutic effects in relapsed/
refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and B-cell
non-Hodgkin lymphoma (B-NHL) [5-7]. Ibrutinib is the
first selective and irreversible small-molecule Btk inhibitor
assessed in clinical trials for the treatment of B-cell
lymphoma. Ibrutinib interacts with the cysteine residue at
position 481 in Btk (Cys481), which is located at the rim
of the ATP-binding pocket. In a phase I, open-label trial,
ibrutinib demonstrated notable anti-lymphoma activities
and a good safety profile in B-cell malignancy patients.
The overall response rate (ORR) of evaluable patients was
60%, including a complete response (CR) rate of 16%,
which indicates that pharmacological inhibition of BCR
pathway holds promise in B-cell lymphoma treatment [8,
9].
Investigating the biological function of Btk, de
Rooij et al. reported that Btk activation is also regulated
via a negative regulation loop that inhibition of Btk
catalytic activity increases Tyr551 phosphorylation level
[10, 11]. Thus, one direction for next-generation Btk
inhibitors pursued by us was to inhibit both the catalytic
activity and the activation of Btk by upstream kinases.
By targeting both properties, these new inhibitors might
potentially downregulate BCR and other related signal
transduction pathways more effectively. Meanwhile,
the different selectivity profile of these inhibitors might
also offer new opportunities beyond what ibrutinib has
achieved. Based on this hypothesis, we recently developed
a novel series of covalent irreversible Btk inhibitors based
on a Type II scaffold [12]. Two noticeable features of
this series of inhibitors have emerged: (1) in contrast to
ibrutinib, which only inhibits Btk’s catalytic activity, these
new inhibitors exhibit a dual-action mode of inhibition for
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Btk catalytic activity and its own activation; (2) this series
of compounds presents a different selectivity profile from
ibrutinib, which demonstrated potent activity against ABL,
Blk, Bmx, Btk, EGFR, HER2, HER4, Lck, p38α, Rlk, Tec,
and VEGFR [13, 14]. Among these compounds, PLS-123
displayed impressive potency against Btk and gave IC50
values of 13 nM against Btk Tyr551 and PLC-γ2 Tyr1217
phosphorylation.
In this paper, we demonstrated that this novel Btk
inhibitor PLS-123 exhibited more potent anti-proliferative
effects than ibrutinib in multiple cellular and in vivo
preclinical models of B-cell lineage malignancy, including
14 kinds of cell lines, patients’ primary tumor cells and
mouse xenograft model. More importantly, the PLS123’s potent efficacy against B-cell lymphoma might be
attributed to effective apoptosis induction, dual-action Btk
inhibitory mode and alternative selectivity profile offered
additional anti-tumor mechanism. Collectively, a new
direction was suggested to pharmacologically modulate
Btk function and efficiently treat B-cell lymphoma.

RESULTS
PLS-123 inhibited the viability

of

B-cell

PLS-123 is a novel high selective Btk inhibitor with
an IC50 less than 5 nM (Figure 1A & 1B). The inhibitory
activities of PLS-123 on the proliferation of 17 types
of B-cell lymphoma cell lines were first analyzed using
the cell viability assay. PLS-123 demonstrated enhanced
anti-proliferative, dose-dependent effects compared
with ibrutinib in 14 of these cell lines without affecting
the viability of CD19+ B cells from healthy volunteers
(Figure 1C). The GI50 values of Btk inhibitors, which were
determined from dose-response curves, are presented in
Table 1. The DLBCL cell line OCI-Ly7 and FL cell line
WSU-NHL displayed the highest PLS-123 sensitivity
with GI50 values in the double-digit nanomolar range.
By contrast, the GI50 values for ibrutinib were in the
micromolar range for these cells. Moreover, PLS-123
also more effectively suppressed the viability of primary
tumor cells (Figure 1D). All these findings highlighted a
remarkable anti-tumor activity of PLS-123 in vitro.

PLS-123-mediated B-cell lymphoma cytotoxicity
is caspase-dependent
To investigate the mechanisms by which PLS123 induced stronger cytotoxic effects than ibrutinib in
malignant B cells, annexin V- and PI-stained apoptotic
cells were analyzed by flow cytometry in the PLS-123sensitive OCI-Ly7 cells. The percentage of annexin
V-positive and PI-negative apoptotic cells peaked

PLS-123 precisely regulates the activation and
catalytic properties of Btk, and results in greater
attenuation of the BCR activating pathway than
ibrutinib

24 hours after PLS-123 treatment (23.5%), whereas
ibrutinib resulted in apoptosis in only 9.9% of the cells
(Figure 2A). These findings correlated with the cell
viability results shown in Figure 1. Furthermore, Western
blotting analysis suggested that PLS-123 more strongly
activated cleaved caspase-3, -8 and -9 as well as PARP
compared with ibrutinib during apoptosis induction in
OCI-Ly7 and SU-DHL-2 cells (Figure 2B). To confirm
caspase-3 involvement in this apoptosis process, caspase-3
enzymatic activity was determined after treatment with
PLS-123 and ibrutinib for indicated period. As shown
in Figure 2C, the active form of caspase-3 was more
significantly increased upon treatment with PLS-123
compared with ibrutinib. Meanwhile, PLS-123-induced
caspase-3 cleavage was completely inhibited by the pancaspase inhibitor z-VAD-fmk, thereby demonstrating that
PLS-123 induced cytotoxicity against B-cell lymphoma
cells is caspase-dependent.
The role of Bcl-2 family proteins in the regulation
of caspase activation has been well characterized in the
mitochondrial apoptotic pathway. The expressions of Bcl2 family proteins were next analyzed by immunoblotting
analysis. As shown in Figure 2D, PLS-123 treatment of
malignant B cells resulted in dramatically decreased levels
of anti-apoptotic proteins, such as XIAP, Bcl-2, Bcl-xL
and Mcl-1. On the other hand, the pro-apoptotic protein
BAX was significantly upregulated, thereby suggesting
that PLS-123 could promote the apoptotic pathway via
regulation of protein targets within mitochondria.

GI50, PLS-123 (μM)

As a novel Btk inhibitor, possible impacts of
PLS-123 towards BCR signaling cascades were next
investigated by immunoblotting analysis. The upstream
BCR signal-activated kinases induce Btk phosphorylation
at the Tyr551 residue, thereby resulting in a 10-fold
increase in Btk’s catalytic activity. This activity is
followed by Btk auto-phosphorylation at Tyr223 and
activation of downstream substrates. Ibrutinib inhibits the
catalytic activities of Btk and the negative BCR pathway
feedback loop, resulting in amplified phosphorylation at
Tyr551 [11]. In our experiment, after 1 hour pretreatment
with both Btk inhibitors, DLBCL cell lines and primary
tumor cells were stimulated with anti-IgM to mimic
BCR/antigen encounters and activate the BCR signal
pathway. PLS-123 not only more significantly suppressed
Btk phosphorylation at Tyr223 compared with ibrutinib
but also reduced elevated Btk phosphorylation at Tyr551
(Figure 3A). Upon stimulation with anti-IgM, fully
activated Btk coordinates PLCγ2 phosphorylation, thereby
resulting in the activation of downstream cascades,
including the MAPK and AKT/mTOR signaling pathways.
Similar to inhibitory activity towards Btk phosphorylation,
Western blotting analyses demonstrated that PLS-123

also effectively reduced PLCγ2, ERK1/2, p38, AKT and
mTOR activation more than ibrutinib does (Figure 3B).
To further confirm the influence of PLS-123 towards
BCR signaling pathway, CCL3 and CCL4 chemokine
secretions from tumor cells after Btk inhibitor treatment,
which is highly regulated and correlated with the signal
activation of the BCR [15, 16], were measured via realtime PCR and ELISA. OCI-Ly7 cells were first pretreated
with Btk inhibitors for 1 hour before activating the BCR
signaling pathway to initiate CCL3 and CCL4 mRNA
transcription. As shown in Figure 3C, both chemokines’
mRNA and protein expressions were more dramatically
reduced by PLS-123 treatment compared with ibrutinib,
indicating that PLS-123 resulted in greater attenuation
of the BCR activating pathway than ibrutinib. More
importantly, all these results might also potentially account

inhibitor. To demonstrate this hypothesis, PTPN11 and Btk
knockdown effect on lymphoma cell viability as revealed
by siRNA transfection. This co-transfection produced
obvious anti-proliferative activity towards tumor cells,
suggesting that PLS-123 might suppress tumor growth
through combination Btk and PTPN11 inhibition (Figure
4E).

PLS-123 overcomes BCR- and chemokinemediated lymphoma cell adhesion and migration
B-NHL patients administered ibrutinib in clinical
trials display reduced lymphadenopathy accompanied by
substantial lymphocytosis, suggesting that the potential
anti-adhesion activity of ibrutinib triggers B-lymphoid
malignant cell mobilization from tumor tissues to the
peripheral blood. To investigate possible effects of PLS123 in active BCR- and chemokine-mediated adhesion,
we analyzed anti-IgM- and chemokine CXCL12-induced
adhesion to the extracellular matrix component fibronectin
and the cellular adhesion molecule VCAM-1 in Namalwa
cells. Compared with ibrutinib’s inhibitory effects, our
novel Btk inhibitor PLS-123 more significantly attenuated
anti-IgM- and CXCL12-mediated adhesion to fibronectin
and VCAM-1 in a dose-dependent manner (Figure 5A).
Moreover, CXCL12 and its cognate receptor CXCR4 axis
also appear to be crucial for migration and homing of
malignant B cells via activation of BCR signal pathway
[19]. In transwell culture system, PLS-123 also more
efficiently blocked neoplastic cells migration toward
chemokine CXCL12 through its dual-action inhibitory
mode of Btk activation (Figure 5B & 5C).

Gene expression profile of B-cell lymphoma post
PLS-123 treatment
Due to the different selectivity profile of PLS-123
from ibrutinib [14], global gene expression profiling was
needed to carry out to get a more comprehensive insight
into alternative anti-tumor mechanisms of this novel
Btk inhibitor. First, compared with vehicle treatment
control, Venn diagram illustrated these Btk inhibitors
top up- and down-regulated gene changes. Ibrutinib was
less efficient with 714 transcripts significantly down (<
-1.5 fold, p < 0.05) compared with 1061 for PLS-123.
Interestingly, approximately 71% of transcripts (508
genes) downregulated by ibrutinib were also contained
in the PLS-123 group (Figure 4A). Both inhibitors
commonly top downregulated representative genes were
illustrated by a heatmap in Figure 4B. Consistent with
results from immunoblotting analysis in Figure 3, PLS123 could efficiently downregulate BCR, AKT/mTOR and
MAPK related signaling pathway.
On the other hand, the different selectivity profile of
PLS-123 from ibrutinib might also contribute to distinct
gene expression signatures and offer new opportunities
beyond what ibrutinib has achieved. Volcano plots of 1441
genes changed in PLS-123 treatment alone (Down: 553
genes; Up: 888 genes) were then used to select additional
anti-tumor target of the novel Btk inhibitor. When filter
criteria were set for fold change < -1.5 and p < 0.001, 10
genes significantly decreased by PLS-123 were identified
in Figure 4C. The mRNA expression analysis of these ten
genes using real-time PCR further confirmed that PLS-123
led to significant downregulation of PTPN11 expression
that might be due to the different selectivity profile of this
inhibitor. As an important oncogenic gene in malignant
B cells [17, 18], the inhibition of PTPN11 expression
might also contribute to great efficacy of this novel Btk

PLS-123 induces anti-tumor activities in B-cell
lymphoma in vivo
The in vivo anti-tumor activity of the Btk inhibitors
was examined in SCID mice inoculated with OCI-Ly7
cells. When the tumor volume was approximately 100150 mm3, the mice were intraperitoneally administered
the indicated concentrations of the Btk inhibitors. Fifteen
days after administration, OCI-Ly7 tumor-bearing animals
treated with 5 or 10 mg/kg of PLS-123 and 20 mg/kg
ibrutinib resulted in significant effects blocking tumor
growth. Similar to previous results from in vitro models,
PLS- 123 also demonstrated more anti-growth effects than
ibrutinib at the same drug dosage of 10 mg/kg (p = 0.038).
Mice treated with 20 mg/kg of PLS-123 displayed the
strongest suppressive activities, and this dosage induced
45% tumor reduction without significant effects on body
weight (p = 0.418; Figure 6A & 6B).
To further evaluating the proliferation,
apoptosis and BCR signal status of tumor tissue post
administration of Btk inhibitors, Ki-67, TUNEL and
p-Btk immunohistochemistry staining was performed

treatment produced a more significant decrease of Ki67 and p-Btk expression than the same concentration of

also clearly observed post PLS-123 treatment, as indicated
by an increase in TUNEL staining. Meanwhile, total RNA
extracted from tumor tissues of PLS-123 20 mg/kg and

Pathway analysis of microarray data confirmed that PLS123 mostly down-regulated BCR, MAPK and PI3K-Akt
signaling pathway in vivo (Figure 6D). Collectively, all
these results confirmed our in vitro findings, in which
PLS-123 induced lymphoma cell death via inhibition of
BCR signaling and induction of apoptosis.

events through its catalytic ability and protein-protein
interactions. When ibrutinib was used, activated Btk
maintained at the Tyr551 phosphorylated stage and did not
come back to the resting form, thus it could still engage
into the signaling complexes or other functions through
protein-protein interactions. Kurosaki et al also reported
that phosphorylation of Tyr551, but not Tyr223, is the key
regulatory position for BCR signaling activation using
Btk-deficient DT40 cell line expressing Btk (Y223F) and
Btk (Y551F) mutation models [25]. Thus, in contrast to
ibrutinib, which only inhibits Btk’s catalytic activity
at Tyr223, our novel developed Btk inhibitor PLS-123
abolished Btk’s activation via transphosphorylation at
Tyr551 and subsequent autophosphorylation at Tyr223,
which resulted in a more concise and effective regulation
of BCR signal and significant anti-proliferative activities
in malignant cells. This dual-action inhibitory mode
of PLS-123 could be considered as a simultaneous
application of a Btk inhibitor and its upstream kinase
inhibitor to doubly control the BCR signal pathway. One
advantage of this approach is that it does not need to care
about which kinase (Lyn, Syk or both) is the primary Btk
activator(s).
Enzymatic activity screen showed that ibrutinib
is not a very selective inhibitor, but promising clinical
efficacy was observed in relapsed/refractory B-cell
lymphoma patients, indicating that pharmacological
effects through other pathways in addition to inhibition
of Btk may function here. Thus, it was very valuable
to present a new series of Btk inhibitors that has a
different mode of regulation and a different selectivity
profile to this field. The alternative selectivity profile
of our novel Btk inhibitor might offer new anti-tumor
mechanisms and potent inhibitory activities in a wider
range of B-cell lymphoma subtypes. In our experiment,
the microarray results demonstrated approximately 71%
of transcripts downregulated post ibrutinib treatment
was also similarly attenuated by PLS-123. Moreover,
the oncogenic gene PTPN11, which was significantly
decreased by PLS-123, was identified as an additional
anti-tumor mechanism of this novel Btk inhibitor. It is
reported that the hyperactivation and misregulation of
PTPN11 played an oncogenic role in various tumor types,
especially germinal center derived lymphoma [18, 26, 27].
In our study, the combination Btk and PTPN11 inhibition
may synergistically suppress growth of malignant B
cells (Figure 4E). This notion indicated that PLS-123’s
great efficacy and anti-proliferative effects in GCBDLBCL lymphoma might not only be simply attributed
to downregulation of BCR signaling pathway alone and
alternative selectivity profile provided downregulation of
PTPN11 expression should also be considered. However,
further experimentation is still needed to explore the
precise mechanism.

DISCUSSION
In this paper, we focused on the anti-tumor activities
of the novel Btk inhibitor PLS-123 in B-cell lymphoma.
PLS-123’s potent anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic
effects in a wide range of B-cell lymphoma subtypes
may be attributed to dual-action Btk inhibitory mode and
alternative selectivity profile provided additional antitumor mechanisms.

of the PI3K pathway [21]. Ibrutinib and our compound
PLS-123 are very potent Btk inhibitors, yet exhibit no
inhibitory role towards Burkitt lymphoma and normal B
cells, suggesting these compounds might not be efficient
targeted approaches towards tonic BCR signaling and Btk
is not essential for tonic BCR signaling. Some lymphoma
subtypes, such as ABC-DLBCL, FL, CLL and MCL,
maybe are more akin to rely upon chronic BCR signaling
[3, 22]. Ibrutinib has shown great efficacy in treating
MCL and CLL patients yet its anti-proliferative activity
is inferior to PLS-123. If these cell lines do rely more on
the chronic BCR signaling pathway, PLS-123 could have a
better therapeutic effect in the clinic. As already suggested
in the results section, the constitutively activated Btk and
PLCγ2 could be detected not only in non-GCB but also
in several GCB-DLBCL (Figure 3A, 3B and data not
shown). It is in accordance to literature reports that some
GCB-DLBCL relied on activated NF-κB, which indicated
that chronic active BCR signaling mechanisms might
involve in the pathogenesis of these patients [23, 24].
Thus, it is not surprising that the novel Btk inhibitor PLS123 exhibits anti-tumor activity in some GCB-DLBCL.
Btk is a member of Tec family non-receptor
protein-tyrosine kinases, which participates in biological

inhibited proliferation and induced apoptosis in CLL and
DLBCL via caspase activation [28-30]. In our study, we
found that PLS-123 efficiently induced the activation of
caspases and regulated Bcl-2 family members expression,
suggesting that PLS-123 potentially activated the
mitochondrial apoptotic pathway in a caspase-dependent
manner. Moreover, it is well demonstrated that the BCR
signaling pathway can sustain the expression of antiapoptotic proteins through activation of the PI3K/Akt
and MEK/ERK pathways [31], supporting the notion that
PLS-123 suppressed the expression of these proteins via
inhibition of downstream BCR-activating pathways.
The interaction of malignant B cells and surrounding
tumor microenvironment is thought to contribute to the
survival and progress of B-cell malignancies [32, 33]. The
encouraging clinical efficacy of ibrutinib not only results
from direct cytotoxic effects but also its inhibition of the
cellular adhesion and migration between tumor cells and
the surrounding microenvironment [34-37]. After ibrutinib
treatment, most CLL and MCL patients display a transient
increase in circulating lymphocytes and a reduction in
spleen and lymph node size, indicating the anti-adhesion
activity of ibrutinib shifts the malignant cells from the
infiltrated tissue to the peripheral blood. In our study, antiIgM and chemokine treatment increased the adhesion of
B-NHL cells to cellular substrates, such as fibronectin
and VCAM-1; this activity was dramatically inhibited
by PLS-123 in a dose-dependent manner (Figure 5A),
suggesting the essential impact of novel Btk inhibitor
towards crosstalk between malignant cells and the
microenvironment.
Collectively, our novel dual-action Btk inhibitor
PLS-123 suggested a new direction to pharmacologically
modulate Btk function and develop potentially therapeutic
drug for the treatment of B-cell lymphoma.

B-cell lymphoma biopsy specimens were collected
under a protocol that was approved by the Institutional
Review Board of the Peking University Cancer Hospital
& Institute, and informed consent was obtained from
all patients. Fresh biopsy specimens were cut into small
pieces and gently minced over a wire mesh screen to
create a cell suspension. Mononuclear cells were isolated
via density gradient centrifugation over Lymphoprep (Axis
Shield, Oslo, Norway). CD19+ primary tumor cells were
purified using negative selection with B-cell Isolation Kit
(Miltenyi Biotec, Bergisch-Gladbach, Germany). CD19+
cell purity was typically greater than 95% as determined
by FACS analysis (BD FACS Aria II, BD Bioscience, NJ,
USA).

(GSE65816 and GSE65817).

Real-time quantitative PCR

siRNA transfection

OCI-Ly7 cells were treated with Btk inhibitors
in the presence or absence of anti-IgM for 12 hours,
and total RNA was extracted via RNA TRIzol
Extraction (Life Technologies). The primer and
probe sequences of the target genes are listed as
follow: β-actin, 5′-CCTGGCACCCAGCACAAT-3′,
5′-GCCGATCCACACGGAGTACT-3′
and
5′-ATCAAGATCATTGCTCCTCCTGAGCGC-3′;
CCL3,
5′-GAGCCCACATTCCGTCACCT-3′,

and
5′-CCACTGCTGCCCTTGCTGTCC-3′;
CCL4,
5′-CAGCGCTCTCAGCACCAA-3′,
5′-AGCTTCCTCGCAGTGTAAGAAAA-3′
and
5′-CTCAGACCCTCCCACCGCCTGC-3′.

OCI-Ly7 cells were seeded on 24-well plates
in complete media on the day of the transfection.
siRNA
oligonucleotides
targeting
PTPN11
(5′-GAAGCACAGUACCGAUUUATT-3′),
Btk
(5′-GGCAGUAAGAAGGGUUCAATT-3′)
were
synthesized by Invitrogen and transfected to cells using the
LipofectamineTM RNAiMAX reagent (Life Technologies).
The efficiency of siRNA knockdown of target genes was
determined by Western blotting.

In vivo studies
Six- to eight-week-old male CB.17/severe combined
immunodeficiency disease (SCID) mice were inoculated
subcutaneously with 5 × 106 OCI-Ly7 tumor cells in 0.1
ml PBS for tumor development. Treatments were initiated
when the tumor volume achieved approximately 100-150
mm3. According to the dose of ibrutinib widely used in
vivo experiment [35], the mice were administered vehicle
or 5, 10 or 20 mg/kg of Btk inhibitors intraperitoneally qd
for 15 days. The tumor tissue samples were collected from
all the 6 groups at 4 hours after the last dosing. All animal
experiments were performed according to the guidelines
for the care and use of animals, which were approved by
the Peking University Cancer Hospital & Institute.

ELISA
CCL3 and CCL4 production from tumor cells
was detected using Human CCL3 and CCL4 Quantikine
ELISA Kits (R&D Systems).

Adhesion and migration assay
Namalwa cells pretreated with the indicated
concentrations of Btk inhibitors or vehicle were stimulated
with anti-IgM or CXCL12 for 30 mins, and then cells
were seeded into 96-well plates that were coated with
fibronectin (BD Biosciences) or VCAM-1 (Sigma). Thirty
minutes later tumor cells were washed twice with PBS
and adherent cells were measured using the Cell TiterGlo luminescent cell viability assay system. Migration
assays were performed in triplicate with transwell insert
chambers coated with VCAM-1. Namalwa cells treated
with Btk inhibitors or not in the upper chamber were
allowed to migrate towards lower compartment contained
CXCL12 (R&D Systems) for 4 hours. The migration of
control untreated cells in the presence of CXCL12 was
normalized to 100%.

Immunohistochemistry and Immunofluorescence
analysis
Immunohistochemistry stains for p-Btk were
performed in the department of pathology of Peking
University Cancer Hospital using the standard
streptavidin-biotin-peroxidase immunostaining procedure.
For Ki-67 immunofluorescence analysis, paraffin sections
were dewaxed, rinsed, and blocked with 2% BSA for 20
mins. Then slides were incubated with anti-Ki-67 antibody
for 2 hours and followed with fluorescein-conjugated
secondary antibodies for another 2 hours. DAPI was used
for nuclear counterstaining. Slides were mounted with
90% glycerol in PBS and visualized with a laser scanning
confocal microscopy (TCS-SP2, Leica Microsystems).

Microarray hybridization and gene expression
analysis
Sample processing, microarray hybridization and
gene expression analyses were performed using the
Affymetrix GeneChip System (Affymetrix, Santa Clara,
CA, USA). The biotinylated cRNA was fragmented and
hybridized to the GeneChip Human Genome U133 Plus
2.0 microarrays (Affymetrix). Pathway analysis was used
to identify the significant pathway of the differential genes
