ABSTRACT
New evidences have recently emerged from studies in yeast and in higher
eukaryotes showing the importance of nutrient balance in dietary regimes and
its effects on longevity regulation. We have previously shown that manipulation
of ammonium concentration in the culture and/or aging medium can drastically
affect chronological lifespan (CLS) of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, especially in amino
acid restricted cells. Here we describe that the CLS shortening under amino acid
restriction can be completely reverted by removing ammonium from the culture
medium. Furthermore, the absence of ammonium, and of any rich nitrogen source,
was so effective in extending CLS that no beneficial effect could be observed by
further imposing calorie restriction conditions. When present in the culture medium,
ammonium impaired the consumption of the auxotrophy-complementing amino acids
and caused in an improper cell cycle arrest of the culture. TOR1 deletion reverted
ammonium effects both in amino acid restricted and non-restricted cultures, whereas,
Ras2p and Sch9p seem to have only a milder effect in the mediation of ammonium
toxicity under amino acid restriction and no effect on non-restricted cultures. Our
studies highlight ammonium as a key effector in the nutritional equilibrium between
rich and essential nitrogen sources and glucose required for longevity promotion.

INTRODUCTION

concentration in culture media is sufficient to increase
replicative and chronological life span (CLS) [4-8].
Further studies have revealed that the major nutrientsignaling pathways TOR, SCH9 and RAS/AC/PKA are
involved in longevity regulation by glucose, promoting
cell division and growth in response to nutrients while
inhibiting the general stress response and autophagy [6, 9].
Manipulation of several single components of the
culture medium is known to extend CLS in yeast [2, 3,
10-12] and so in the past couple of years many medium
components have surfaced as aging affecting factors [1315]. Components of the culture media other than glucose,
such as amino acids [3, 10-12, 16] and factors like the
products of fermentation have also been implicated in the
regulation of CLS [17, 18]. Acidification of the culture
media mainly due to acetic acid and other organic acids
production negatively impacts CLS [18]. Ethanol is
another fermentative metabolite capable of inducing CLS
reduction in aged cells by yet unknown mechanisms [17,

The budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae is
a highly exploited model to study environmental and
genetic factors affecting longevity. The aging process is
conserved from yeasts to mammals, with several studies
showing that reducing growth factors/nutrients intake
has profound positive effects in extension of life span
and also improves overall health by delaying or reducing
aged-related diseases in mammals [1]. The manipulation
of well conserved nutrient-signaling pathways can be
accomplished by dietary restriction (DR), in which the
intake of nutrients, and not necessarily calories, is reduced
without causing malnutrition, or by caloric restriction
(CR) usually referring to a 20-40% reduction in calorie
intake [1]. In yeast, the vast majority of protocols for
CR are based on the decrease of glucose concentration
in the medium from the standard 2% to 0.5 or 0.05%.
[2, 3]. Studies using CR show that reducing glucose

same time, preferentially stimulating translation of GCN4
mRNA [27, 28].
In yeast as well as in higher eukaryotes, cells sense
amino acid levels by two conserved signal-transducing
kinases, the eIF2α kinase GCN2 and TOR kinase
[29]. Cells are capable of sensing not only absence of
individual amino acids but also the presence of more
adequate ones. In response to single amino acid depletion,
uncharged tRNAs accumulate and activate Gcn2p [30].
On the contrary, TOR kinase seems to respond to the
presence, rather than the absence, of specific amino acids.
Regulation of both GCN2 and TOR kinases in amino acid
sensing has been described as having a major impact on
dietary restriction longevity [29].
Our previous studies determined a role for
ammonium (NH4+), a good nitrogen source commonly
used by S. cerevisiae, as an extrinsic factor negatively
affecting the yeast longevity, the effect being positively
correlated with the concentration of NH4+ added to the
culture medium [31]. We further demonstrated that NH4+
toxicity during yeast aging in water depends on the
specific auxotrophy-complementing amino acid they are
deprived of, and provided new insights in the modulation
of CLS by NH4+, linking NH4+ toxicity to amino acid
limitation [32].
Herewith, our findings support the view that
the CLS shortening observed under auxotrophycomplementing amino acids restriction can be reverted
by removing the non-limiting good nitrogen sources
(NH4+ or glutamine in the present work) from the culture
medium and that the abundance of these non-limiting
good nitrogen sources also affects yeast CLS preventing
its expansion. Shortening of CLS in these conditions was
accompanied by the induction of replicative stress and by
an impairment of the essential amino acids consumption.
We further demonstrate that NH4+ is a necessary nutrient
for the beneficial effects of caloric restriction on longevity
to occur, highlighting the importance of a nutritional
equilibrium between several nutrients, other than glucose
alone, on longevity regulation.

19]. These products of fermentation are believed to act
as carbon sources and activate pro-aging pathways, thus
preventing cells from entering a CR state [13]. A recent
study postulates that not only individual components of
the medium but rather a nutritional balance of medium
composition, greatly affects yeast longevity [14].
The authors showed that a balance between glucose,
amino acids and yeast nitrogen base (YNB), played
a significant role in regulation of yeast CLS. The wellknown lengthening effect of CR on longevity seems to
be dependent on other nutrients in the medium, instead of
glucose alone. It further suggests that nutrient composition
is an important factor for longevity of budding yeast and
the three nutrients and their interactions play different
roles in the lifespan of different strains [14]. Furthermore,
new evidences have emerged linking DR to anti-aging
effects by elucidating how glucose and amino acids
threonine, valine and serine modulate stress and aging in
yeast cells [20].
Another pro-aging factor recently implicated on
yeast CLS is DNA replication stress that culminates in a
cell failure to arrest in G0/G1 phase, leading to replication
stress-induced genome instability and apoptosis [21].
DNA replication stress has also been reported as a major
cause of genome instability at early stages of cancer
[22]. Also a correlation between CLS extension and a
more efficient G0/G1 arrest was found in mutational
inactivation of conserved RAS, TOR and SCH9 nutrientsignaling pathways or in calorie restriction conditions [23,
24]. Other studies additionally revealed that starvation of
“natural” nutrients such as phosphate and sulphate leads to
an arrest in G0/G1 cell cycle phase of prototrophic cells,
while auxotrophic cells failed to arrest the cell cycle upon
starvation of essential nutrients (auxotrophic nutrients)
[25]. These findings clearly reveal a failure of auxotrophic
cells in regulating nutrient sensing in response to
starvation of essential nutrients [16]. Furthermore, limiting
levels of auxotrophy-complementing amino acids, in the
growth medium, induced an early arrest in G2/M phase,
negatively affecting chronological longevity and leading
to a premature aging phenotype [11].
In yeast, not all nitrogen sources are equally
preferred, being selected through the nitrogen catabolite
repression (NCR) mechanism also known as nitrogen
discrimination pathway (NDP) [26]. This pathway enables
yeast to repress genes that code for proteins required for
the use of poor nitrogen sources, when in the presence of
sufficient quantities of rich nitrogen sources like glutamine
[27]. Another major transcriptional regulatory system in
nitrogen metabolism is the general amino acid control
pathway (GAAC). The GAAC was first described as a
stress response pathway that, in reaction to amino acid
starvation, activates the protein kinase Gcn2p (general
amino acid control non-derepressible 2) to phosphorylate
the eukaryotic initiation factor-2 (eIF2p) reducing its
activity and thus lowering global translation while at the

RESULTS
The CLS shortening induced under auxotrophycomplementing amino acids restriction can be
reverted by removing ammonium or another nonlimiting good nitrogen source from the culture
medium
We have previously established that NH4+ at the
concentration commonly used in SD medium [0.5%,
(NH4)2SO4], is toxic for aging yeast particularly when
grown under amino acid restriction conditions, leading
to cell death in a concentration dependent manner, with a

significant increase in cell survival being observed when
the NH4+ concentration in the medium was decreased
to 0.01% [31]. We now pursued to investigate how the
CLS is modulated by the complete absence of NH4+,
with or without auxotrophy-complementing amino acids
restriction, and further evaluated the specificity of the NH4+
effect on the CLS by extending the studies to glutamine,
another good nitrogen source for the yeast S. cerevisiae.
Results presented in Figure 1A and 1B, showed that in
cultures with amino acid restriction (low concentrations
of auxotrophy-complementing amino acids – LAA
medium) and without NH4+ supplementation, cells did not
lose their viability during 25 days of CLS experiments,
maintaining it close to maximum value (100% CFU).
On the contrary, in the same media but in the presence
of NH4+ a rapid shortening of CLS was observed, with
no viable cells being detected after 3 days. Furthermore,
cells aged in the first condition (LAA medium, without
NH4+ supplementation) displayed a CLS that was almost

identical to the ones grown without amino acids restriction
(high concentrations of auxotrophy-complementing amino
acids – HAA medium), either in the presence or absence of
NH4+ (Fig. 1A and 1B).
In order to evaluate the specificity of the NH4+ effect
on the CLS shortening we replaced in the culture medium
NH4+ by glutamine. The results indicated that, like for
NH4+, cells grown in LAA medium with glutamine lost
viability fast displaying a very short CLS, as compared
with that of cells grown in LAA medium in the absence
of a good nitrogen source (Fig. 1A and 1B). Also and
importantly, for LAA medium, glutamine supplementation
resulted in a CLS shortening that was similar to the one of
LAA cells with NH4+ in the medium, suggesting that the
shortening effect in CLS is not specific of NH4+, rather
it appears that it may be induced by other non-limiting
good nitrogen sources like glutamine. Thus, these results
together strongly suggest that the CLS shortening that
takes place in SD medium with 2% glucose under essential

amino acids restriction is mainly due to the presence of
non-limiting good nitrogen sources in the culture medium
(NH4+ or glutamine, in the present work) since in their
absence no significant difference in CLS was observed
between cells cultured in HAA or LAA media. Therefore,
the CLS shortening effect described in SD medium with
0.5% of NH4+ sulphate and 2% glucose as being induced
by amino acid restriction [11] can be reverted by removing
the non-limiting good nitrogen sources from the culture
medium. These conclusions are valid both for buffered
(Fig. 1) and non-buffered SD medium (Fig. S1).

measurable at day 25 in 0.5% glucose medium, whereas
for 2% glucose no viable cells could be detected after day
3. On the other hand, for LAA medium without NH4+, no
extension of CLS was observed for cells grown in 0.5%
when compared with 2% glucose and, on the contrary, the
imposed caloric restriction was associated with a CLS
shortening (Fig. 1).
It should be highlighted that in LAA medium
with 0.5% glucose, the presence of NH4+ still induces a
much faster decrease in cell viability than in its absence,
suggesting that, independently of caloric restriction, NH4+
appears to be the major responsible for the observed CLS
shortening under amino acid restriction.
In short, data suggest that the caloric restriction
effect can be observed under amino acid restriction
conditions in the presence of NH4+, but not in its absence.
Therefore, this indicates that NH4+ mediates the required
nutritional signaling that allows the beneficial effect of
caloric restriction on longevity to occur, as described for
other set of nutrients [14].

The CLS extending effect of caloric restriction
attained by decreasing glucose concentration is
not observed in the absence of a non-limiting good
nitrogen source
As it was referred in introduction, the nutritional
balance of medium composition, greatly affects yeast
longevity and the effect of caloric restriction on longevity
may be dependent on other nutrients in the medium,
instead of glucose alone [14]. Herewith, we tested if this
nutritional balance requirement is also applied to NH4+
and therefore, if its effects on CLS are influenced by
differences in glucose concentrations in combination with
restriction or not of essential amino acids concentrations.
We started by measuring glucose consumption in media
with 2% glucose under the conditions used in previous
section. As it is shown by the results presented in Fig.
1A and Fig. 1B the sugar was totally depleted in media
with high amino acid concentrations (HAA medium),
with or without NH4+, although a delay of one day was
encountered in the latter medium. On the other hand,
glucose consumption was much slower in medium with
low amino acid concentrations (LAA medium), being
depleted only after 6 days in medium lacking NH4+, and
not being completely consumed for medium with NH4+
wherein a fast loss of cell viability occurred. Next, we
measured CLS in the same media, but imposing caloric
restriction by decreasing glucose concentration from 2%
to 0.5%. For all the conditions tested (LAA or HAA media
supplemented with 0.5% glucose, with and without NH4+,
pH 3.4 and 6.0) glucose was completely depleted before
the beginning of the aging period, day 0 (Fig. 1C and 1D).
Regarding the CLS pattern, the results showed that for
the HAA medium without NH4+, during the experimental
period of 21-26 days no significant differences were
observed in the CLS measured either in 2% or 0.5%
glucose at both pH values. In HAA medium with NH4+, for
0.5% glucose, comparatively with 2% glucose medium,
a slight extension in the CLS started to be observed after
day 18 (Fig. 1C) which is in agreement with expected
caloric restriction effect. As to LAA medium with NH4+,
decreasing the glucose concentration, from 2% to 0.5%,
strongly increased the CLS, cell viability being still
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

The majority of ammonium during aging is not
consumed and its presence in the medium is
associated with a decrease of the consumption of
the auxotrophy-complementing amino acids
To determine if the presence of NH4+ could be
affecting cell viability by impairing the use of auxotrophycomplementing amino acids, we assessed the NH4+ and
amino acid consumption during aging experiments in the
culture medium. Regarding NH4+, there were no major
differences for all the conditions tested (LAA and HAA
media with 2% or 0.5% glucose at pH 3.4 and pH 6.0) and
NH4+ was never completely consumed, remaining in the
medium during culture aging (Fig. 2). Next, we measured
by HPLC, under the same experimental conditions, the
medium content of the auxotrophy-complementing amino
acids in the presence and absence of NH4+. In HAA
medium, either with 2% or 0.5% glucose, in the presence
of NH4+ (Fig. 3A and 3C), from the three auxotrophiccomplementing amino acids (leucine, lysine and histidine)
only leucine was depleted from the medium after day 3
of the CLS experiment, at both pH values tested (Fig. 3A
and 3C, and Fig. S2). On the contrary, in HAA medium
without NH4+ either with 2% or 0.5% glucose, all three
amino acids were completely depleted at both pH values,
indicating that the presence of NH4+ seems to inhibit the
complete consumption of these amino acids. In LAA
medium pH 3.4, similar results were found, either with 2%
or 0.5% glucose, in the presence or absence of NH4+ (Fig.
3B and 3D). However, in LAA medium in the presence
of NH4+, poor amino acids consumption was noticed,
particularly for leucine that was fully consumed for most
conditions tested, except for LAA medium with NH4+ in
which a fast loss of cell viability occurred (Fig. 3). At

acids, although a delay in their consumption was detected
in comparison to pH 3.4 (Fig. S2 and Fig. 3).

of CLS in comparison to the wild type CLS (Fig. 4A) but
do not seem to mediate the toxic response to NH4+ as in
their absence the CLS of both deleted strains decreased
slower than in medium with NH4+. On the contrary, in LAA
medium with NH4+, but not its absence, Ras2p and Sch9p
appear to mediate cell death, an extension of CLS being
observed upon their deletion in comparison to the wildtype cells (Fig. 4B). As verified in the previous section for
the wild type cells, the absence of NH4+ in LAA medium
also significantly decreased the death phenotype induced
by NH4+ in these mutants, without however, presenting a
complete abolishment as observed for wild type cells (Fig.
4B). These results suggest that in amino acid restriction
conditions without NH4+, Sch9p and Ras2p are necessary
for cell survival. Tor1p does not specifically respond to
amino acid concentrations in medium, displaying an
extended CLS in both LAA and HAA medium (Fig. 4A
and 4B). However, Tor1p may be involved in mediating
NH4+-induced cell death in low amino acid concentrations,
presenting an extension of CLS upon its deletion.

PKA and TOR pathways regulate the NH4+induced CLS shortening during aging in culture
medium
We have previously shown that for cells aged in
water, that is under extreme caloric restriction, the toxic
effects of NH4+ are mediated by activation of PKA and
TOR and inhibition of SCH9 [31]. In order to unravel
which nutrient signaling pathways might be involved in
NH4+-induced CLS shortening in culture medium, where
other nutrients might also interfere with these signaling
pathways, tor1Δ, ras2Δ and sch9Δ cells were cultured in
medium supplemented with low and high auxotrophiccomplementing amino acids concentrations (LAA and
HAA media), buffered to pH 3.4. The results showed
that in HAA medium in the presence or absence of
NH4+, both ras2Δ and sch9Δ cells loose viability rapidly
in comparison to wild-type cells that do not present a
significant loss of cell viability under these conditions
(Fig. 4A). Hence, Ras2p and Sch9p seem to mediate
survival in response to favorable conditions of amino acids
(HAA medium) since their deletion resulted in a decrease

PKA pathway may inhibit Rim15p and consequently
compromise entrance in G0 state [33], we also assessed
whether NH4+ could be inducing replicative stress by
monitoring cell cycle progression by flow cytometry along
aging experiments under the different conditions tested
above.
The results from the cell cycle analysis demonstrate
that the percentage of cells in G0/G1 at stationary phase
was lower in the presence of NH4+ for cells cultured both
in medium with high or low amino acid concentrations
with 2% glucose, this value being particularly low for
LAA medium with NH4+, therefore indicating that the
presence of NH4+ inhibits a proper cell cycle arrest (Fig.
5A and 5C). In media lacking NH4+ (Fig. 5B and 5D),
either LAA or HAA, the percentage of cells in G0/G1
at stationary phase was close to 90% indicating a proper
arrest of the culture.
In cells cultured under calorie restriction conditions,
the presence of NH4+ inhibits a proper cell cycle arrest
only for cells cultured in medium with low amino acid
concentrations supplemented with NH4+, in medium
buffered to pH 3.4 or pH 6.0 (Fig. 6C and 7C). In medium
lacking NH4+ or with high amino acid concentrations and
NH4+ (Fig. 6A, 6B and 6D; Fig. 7A, 7B and 7D) cells
presented a proper arrest in G0/G1 phase. These results
show that there is a strong correlation between faster
loss of cell viability during aging and the inability of the
culture to enter G0/G1 and thus suggest the occurrence of

a replicative stress induced by NH4+.

DISCUSSION
The budding yeast S. cerevisiae is nowadays one
of the most exploited models to study the environmental
and genetic factors affecting longevity. Using this
model we have previously shown that manipulation of
NH4+ concentration in the culture and/or aging medium
can drastically affect chronological lifespan (CLS),
especially in amino acid restricted cells [31, 32]. In other
reports methionine restriction is described as prolonging
lifespan in yeast and mammalian cells [34, 35], recently,
being demonstrated that the difference in CLS extension
presented by EUROSCARF wild-type long-lived BY4741
strain and the short-lived BY4742 is due to the capacity of
biosynthesis of methionine presented by the latter strain
[36]. The results presented herewith provide evidence that
culturing S. cerevisiae in amino acid restriction conditions,
in the presence of a non-limiting good nitrogen source
(NH4+ and glutamine, in the present work) greatly reduces
CLS in association with replicative stress induction. The
CLS shortening is mainly due to the abundance of the
non-limiting good nitrogen source in the culture medium,
since in its absence no significant difference in CLS was
observed between cells cultured with or without amino
acid restriction (LAA or HAA media).

Evidence from several studies increasingly suggests
that not only caloric restriction but a balance of different
nutrients have a pivotal role in regulating lifespan [37].
In fruit flies DR-induced longevity was achieved by
reducing calories of the source of protein, yeast extract,
which provided greater lifespan extension than isocaloric
reduction of sucrose [38]. Similarly, addition of essential
amino acids to dietary restriction in sucrose plus yeastbased diet diminishes longevity extension [39]. In mice,
a current study establishes a ratio between carbohydrate
and protein that significantly affects longevity without
being influenced by total calorie intake, demonstrating
that increasing of the protein: carbohydrate ratio leads to
mTOR activation in association with low glucose and high
levels of circulating branched-chain amino acids [40]. In
our present work, the caloric restriction effect could be
observed under amino acid restriction conditions, but only
in the presence of NH4+, not in its absence. Furthermore,
in LAA medium under calorie restriction conditions, a
much faster decrease in cell viability is observed in the
presence of NH4+ than in its absence, indicating that NH4+
per si, independently of glucose concentration in the
medium during aging, is a major accountable for the CLS
shortening observed under amino acid restriction.
As concerns the influence of pH in aging, our
results show that buffering media not only to pH 6.0
(Fig. 1B) but also to pH 3.4 (Fig. 1A) largely extends
CLS in HAA media with or without NH4+ and in LAA
media without NH4+ (Fig. S1 and Fig. 1A). Buffering
LAA media in the presence of NH4+ to either pH 3.4 or
pH 6.0 had no measurable effect on CLS (Fig. 1A and
1B). This is in agreement with our previous work where
we showed that pH (between 2.8 and 7.0) did not have
a significant effect on NH4+-induced CLS shortening of
cells aged in water. In another study it was also shown
that buffering of aging cultures to pH 6.0 is sufficient to
increase CLS as compared to that measured at pH 3.0, an
effect that was attributed to the dissociation of acetic acid,
resulting in a decrease of the acetic acid concentration
in the undissociated form with increasing pH (the anion
acetate is prevalent at pH 6.0) [18]. Interestingly, our
results demonstrate that buffering media to a low pH
such as 3.4, where no significant differences in the acetic
acid protonated form are encountered as compared to the
unbuffered medium (medium pH after 96 hours in 2%
glucose SC medium is around 2.87 [18]), considerably
extends CLS suggesting that in our conditions acetic acid
does not seem to be involved in the CLS shortening.
A recent study demonstrated that S. cerevisiae
sequentially uses amino acids and NH4+, with no marked
differences in the order of assimilation of the nitrogen
compounds between strains tested, and that this sequential
use is largely determined by both the kinetic characteristics
and the regulation of the transporters of amino acids and
NH4+. The initial concentrations of these compounds did
not alter the order in which they were consumed, except
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

for arginine and NH4+ [41].
In our data, the majority of NH4+ was not consumed
in the two conditions tested (LAA and HAA) and its
presence in the medium was associated with a decrease of
the consumption of the essential amino acids. This effect
of NH4+ on the consumption of the essential amino acids is
more accentuated in LAA medium, particularly for leucine
which was associated with a drastic decrease of CLS
exhibited in this condition. The NH4+ concentration in
the culture medium has been described to influence NH4+
consumption patterns [41]. In our studies, the variances
encountered regarding nitrogen consumption could be due
to the NH4+ concentration [0.5%, (NH4)2SO4], the common
concentration present in laboratory culture media, as well
as to the use of auxotrophic strains that could present
alterations in nitrogen regulation.
About the involvement of nutrient signaling
pathways in CLS regulation in the conditions tested, our
results suggest that Ras2p and Sch9p seem to mediate
survival in response to favorable conditions of amino acids
(HAA medium) since its deletion resulted in a decrease
of CLS in comparison to the wild type CLS (Figure
4A), but they appear not to be involved on the toxic
response to NH4+ since the CLS of both deleted strains
decreased slower in the HAA medium lacking NH4+ than
in its presence. On contrary, in LAA medium with NH4+,
Ras2p and Sch9p seem to mediate cell death, with the
deficiency on these proteins resulting in an extension of
CLS in comparison to the wild-type cells. These results
may be correlated to other studies where NH4+ in the
presence of glucose triggers a rapid PKA activation via
Sch9p leading to fermentative growth and inhibiting a
stress resistance response [42, 43]. Interestingly, in LAA
medium without NH4+ these proteins adopt a pro- survival
role as demonstrated by the decrease in CLS extension
in comparison to wild type cells upon their deletion.
Both Ras2p and Sch9p have been involved in longevity
regulation with deletions of these genes extending CLS.
In our results, the two deleted strains were overall less
long-lived than the WT strain, in agreement with other
works where medium composition and strain background
influence longevity of these deleted strains [14, 44]. In
fact, Sch9p has been described as being more sensitive
to nutrients, including to NH4+, than other deleted strains
tested in medium with YNB and amino acids variations,
which had major influence on the CLS of the sch9Δ strain
[14, 31].
Additionally, Tor1p seems to mediate cell death
in low amino acid concentrations, both in the presence
and absence of NH4+. Amino acid sensing can occur
through two conserved signal transduction pathways,
the eIF2α (eukaryotic initiation factor 2α) kinase GCN2
(general amino acid control non-derepressible 2) and TOR
kinase [29]. In yeast, the GCN2-based GAAC response
is activated when individual amino acids are deficient,
on the other hand the presence of certain amino acids,
6519

Oncotarget

such as leucine, activates TORC1, increasing TORC1dependent phosphorylation of Sch9p [45, 46]. In this way,
the observed inhibition of total leucine depletion in the
presence of NH4+ in LAA medium (Fig. 3B) could lead to
an activation of the TOR pathway and to a rapid decrease
of the CLS. In contrast, the depletion from the medium
of an individual amino acid such as leucine, exhibited
in the other conditions tested (Fig. 3), could activate a
GCN2-based GAAC response, resulting in the observed
extended longevity (Fig. 1). A recent work in mammalian
cells has also demonstrated a parallel activation of the
GAAC pathway and mTOR deactivation in response to
serum/glutamine starvation. mTOR reactivation was
dependent on exogenous leucine and leucine transporter
up-regulation [47]. Our data showing interplay between
NH4+ and amino acids during yeast chronological aging
in the culture medium further suggest the GCN2 role
in longevity as a direct amino acid starvation response
activator. Further studies in yeast, to unravel ammonium’s
amino acid consumption inhibition and a possible role of
the amino acid sensing kinases GCN2 and TOR1, could
now be explored as a model to more complex systems.
A correlation between GCN2 and autophagy has
also been described for amino acid starvation conditions
where only auxotrophy-complementing amino acids are
capable of inducing an autophagic trafficking pathway
completely dependent on Gcn2p and Gcn4p, and distinct
from macroautophagy induced by total nitrogen starvation
[48]. Our findings suggest that the presence of a nonlimiting rich nitrogen source, like NH4+, in LAA medium
and the associated impairment of essential amino acids
consumption could be related with an inhibition of
macroautophagy and promotion of a lower autophagic
response induced by amino acid starvation which may
lead to a rapid loss of cell viability. This hypothesis is
supported by our previous results showing that autophagy
was not induced in a 24 hour amino acid-starvation
conditions versus a 24 hour nitrogen-starvation condition
[31].
The observed negative effect of NH4+ during aging
appeared to be associated with replication stress induction.
Actually the results from the cell cycle analysis indicate
that the presence of NH4+ inhibits a proper cell cycle
arrest for cells cultured both in medium with high or low
amino acid concentrations with 2% glucose (Fig. 5A and
5C) as compared with a proper arrest of the culture in the
same media lacking NH4+. In cells cultured under calorie
restriction conditions, the presence of NH4+ also inhibits a
proper cell cycle arrest but only for cells cultured in LAA
medium. These results are in agreement with previous
evidences showing that cells with auxotrophys fail to
coordinate proper cell cycle arrest upon starvation for
the respective auxotrophy while cells starved for natural
nutrients such as glucose, phosphate or sulfate achieve a
prompt cell cycle arrest [16, 25]. Our results now show
that the failure of auxotrophy-complementing amino acid
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

limited cells to enter proper cell cycle arrest is due to the
presence of NH4+ in the culture medium (and possible any
other rich nitrogen source). Also, the observed proper cell
cycle arrest for cells under caloric restriction in medium
with high amino acid concentrations and NH4+ (Fig. 7A)
strongly suggests that glucose as the limiting nutrient is the
main responsible for signaling entrance in G0 phase. This
is in line with previous results showing that yeast viability
and failure to commit to the cell division cycle depends on
which nutrient is limited first, based on a survival strategy
in the face of inadequate nutrition [16, 49].
In summary, our results indicate that NH4+ promotes
aging through the regulation of the same pathways as
the ones involved in glucose-induced aging and further
substantiate that the activation of these pathways is
cumulative. Consequently, excess of both nutrients highly
contribute to aging and decrease of only one of them
will alleviate signaling and promote longevity. However,
decreasing nutrient concentration in the medium is only
beneficial if the limiting nutrient can induce cells to
properly enter a G0 phase on its exhaustion. Furthermore,
the CLS shortening induced under auxotrophycomplementing amino acids restriction appeared to be
mainly due to the presence of a non-limiting rich nitrogen
source in the culture medium (NH4+ and glutamine, in
the present work) and that the abundance of NH4+ in the
medium could be affecting cell viability by impairing the
use of the essential amino acids. Moreover, the beneficial
effect of nitrogen restriction on CLS can only be observed
for NH4+ or non-essential amino acids like glutamine, but
not for the essential amino acids of the strain BY4742
used in the present work. The effect of rich nitrogen
source restriction seems to be particularly relevant if there
is simultaneous restriction of an essential amino acid.
Thus, considering the use of rich nitrogen sources, the
reduction in its abundance in the medium rather than the
nitrogen source specificity appears to be more important
for the extension of life span.
As a final remark, herewith we present for the first
time evidence supporting that NH4+ is a key determinant in
the nutritional balance required for the beneficial effect of
dietary restriction on longevity, therefore shedding light on
how nutrient balance of dietary regimes could also affect
longevity in higher eukaryotes.

METHODS
Strains and growth conditions
Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain BY4742 (MATa
his3Δ1 leu2Δ0 lys2Δ0 ura3Δ0) (EUROSCARF, Frankfurt,
Germany) and the respective knockouts in RAS2,
SCH9, and TOR1 genes, were used. For experiments
with stationary phase cells with or without restriction
6520

of auxotrophy-complementing amino acids (essential
amino acids), cells were cultured at 26 ºC, 150 rpm,
until stationary phase was reached, in defined minimal
medium (SD medium) containing 0.17% yeast nitrogen
base without amino acids and without ammonium sulphate
(Difco, BD), 2% or 0.5% D-glucose; supplemented with
or without ammonium sulphate (5 g/L) or glutamine (700
mg/L), and with low (10 mg/L histidine, 10 mg/L lysine,
60 mg/L leucine and 100 mg/L uracil) or high (50 mg/L
histidine, 50 mg/L lysine, 300 mg/L leucine and 100 mg/L
uracil) concentrations of essential amino acids. Citrate
phosphate was used for buffering medium to pH 3.4 (28.2
mM Na2HPO4 and 35.9 mM citric acid) or to pH 6.0 (64.2
mM Na2HPO4 and 17.9 mM citric acid). At stationary
phase, cell density was adjust to about 3.8 x 10 7cells/ml.
Viability of stationary 3 day old cultures was considered
to be 100% of survival and this was considered day 0
of the aging experiment. Cell viability was assessed by
Colony Forming Units (CFU) at day 0 (100% viability)
and in subsequent days, as indicated, of culture aliquots
incubated for 2 days at 30 °C on YEPD agar plates.

amino acids in the samples was performed in an automated
fashion using a Gilson 234 auto-injector. Mobile phases
were (A) aqueous solution of 175 mM Na2H2PO4 and 125
mM propionic acid, HPLC grade Acetonitrile and HPLC
grade water at pH 7.8 (40:8:52 by vol.) and (B) HPLC
grade acetonitrile, HPLC grade methanol and HPLC grade
water (30:30:40 by vol.)
