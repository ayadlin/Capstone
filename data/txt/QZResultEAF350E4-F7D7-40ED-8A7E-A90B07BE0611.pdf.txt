Selective Killing of Cancer Cells by Suppression
of Geminin Activity

Abstract
Eukaryotic cells normally restrict genome duplication to once
per cell division. In metazoa, re-replication of DNA during a
single S phase seems to be prevented solely by suppressing
CDT1 activity, a protein required for loading the replicative
MCM DNA helicase. However, siRNA suppression of geminin
(a specific inhibitor of CDT1) arrested proliferation only of
cells derived from cancers by inducing DNA re-replication and
DNA damage that spontaneously triggered apoptosis. None of
these effects were detected either in cells derived from normal
human tissues or in cells immortalized by a viral oncogene. To
induce these effects in noncancer cells required suppression
of both geminin and cyclin A, another cell cycle regulator.
Therefore, initiating DNA replication in some cancer cells is
limited solely by regulating the level of CDT1 activity with
geminin, whereas noncancer cells contain additional safeguards that prevent DNA re-replication. These results show
that inhibition of geminin activity could be used to selectively
kill cancer cells without harming other cells. [Cancer Res
2009;69(11):4870–7]

Introduction
DNA replication begins with assembly of prereplication complexes (preRC) at multiple sites throughout the genome as cells exit
metaphase (1). PreRCs are then assembled into preinitiation
complexes that are subsequently activated by protein kinases to
begin DNA synthesis (S phase; ref. 2). Once S phase begins, further
assembly of preRCs is prevented by phosphorylation, ubiquitination, and degradation of preRC proteins ORC1, CDC6, and CDT1,
and by geminin, a specific protein inhibitor of CDT1 activity unique
to metazoa (3, 4).
Eukaryotic cell division is regulated through multiple convergent
pathways to restrict genome duplication to once and only once each
time a cell divides (3, 4). When these pathways are subverted, random
reinitiation of DNA replication occurs throughout the genome before
mitosis, an event called DNA re-replication. This results in cells with
greater than 4N DNA content that are sensitive to drugs that
inactivate DNA damage response pathways (5–7). Therefore, if DNA
re-replication could be induced selectively in cancer cells, cancer cells
could be killed without harming normal cells.
An effective cancer therapy must target cancer cells without
harming noncancer cells. Over expression of geminin in cancer
cells does not prevent their proliferation (8–10), but inhibition of

preRC assembly either by overexpressing a nondegradable form of
geminin (9, 10), or by suppressing expression of Orc2, Cdc6, or
Mcm2 genes induces apoptosis. However, these treatments also
arrest noncancer cells in G1 phase (10–12). Cancer cells induce
apoptosis under these conditions by entering S phase with too few
licensed replication origins, a situation that increases the frequency
of stalled replication forks and thereby triggers the DNA damage
response of the cell (13). Unfortunately, noncancer cells that are
arrested in G1 phase by preventing preRC assembly will also
eventually undergo apoptosis because only cells arrested in a
quiescent G0 state are stable for prolonged periods of time. PreRC
assembly occurs during the mitotic anaphase to G1 phase
transition (1, 14). When the cell cycle is arrested before
phosphorylation of the retinoblastoma tumor suppressor protein
(Rb) and before the ‘‘restriction point’’ at which entry into S phase
becomes independent of serum mitogens, they undergo apoptosis,
although perhaps not as quickly as cancer cells (15, 16). This
difference between cancer and noncancer cells arises from the fact
that cancer cells can pass through the restriction point (G1-S phase
checkpoint) under conditions where noncancer cells cannot (17).
Thus, inhibition of origin licensing simply induces apoptosis more
quickly in cancer cells than in noncancer cells.
Here, we took the opposite tack in an effort to determine the
feasibility of a cancer therapy based on the spontaneous induction
of apoptosis in response to relicensing replication origins during
S phase. From yeast to mammals, relicensing of replication origins
during cell proliferation is prevented either by modification or
degradation of various preRC proteins (3, 13, 18). However, numerous
results suggest that the primary regulatory target in most, perhaps all,
metazoan cells is CDT1, a preRC protein that is required for loading
the MCM DNA helicase onto the replication origin. Overexpression of
CDT1 induces DNA re-replication in cells from mammals (19, 20),
flies (21), frogs (22–25), and plants (26), and siRNA depletion of
geminin induces DNA re-replication in cells from flies (27) and
mammals (5–7, 28). Moreover, deletion of the geminin gene results in
DNA re-replication in preimplantation mouse embryos (29, 30).
These results make a compelling case that CDT1 activity is the ratelimiting component for initiation of DNA replication in metazoa.
There are two ways to increase CDT1 activity in mammalian
cells: increase the amount of CDT1 protein or inactivate geminin.
Overexpression of CDT1 in mammalian cells has been reported
to induce DNA re-replication only in cells that lack p53 activity
(19, 20), but other studies conclude that overexpression of CDT1
does not induce significant DNA re-replication in mammalian
cells as long as the ATR checkpoint is intact (31). Moreover,
DNA lesions accumulate in primary cells even when CDT1
overexpression failed to induce re-replication, making all cells
with excess CDT1 sensitive to genotoxic stress (31). Thus,
overexpression of CDT1 does not seem to be a useful approach
to cancer therapy. Therefore, we considered the alternative
approach of increasing CDT1 activity by reducing geminin levels.

Selective Killing of Cancer Cells

Figure 1. Depletion of geminin induced DNA re-replication in colorectal cancer
cells (SW480 and HCT116) but not in normal colon cells (CCD 841 CoN and
FHC). The indicated cells were transfected with siRNA against either firefly
luciferase (siGL2) or human geminin (siGem). At 48 h posttransfection, cells
were harvested and stained either with propidium iodide to quantify their DNA
content by FACS analysis, or with DAPI to visualize their nuclei by fluorescence
microscope. The percentage of cells is given with greater than 4N DNA
content (FACS profiles) or with nuclei whose diameter is greater than twice that
of nuclei in siGL2 treated cells. Geminin and actin proteins were detected by
Western immunoblotting.

Remarkably, the response of mammalian cells to geminin
depletion was entirely cell type dependent. Depletion of geminin in
cells derived from cancers resulted in arrest of cell proliferation, DNA
re-replication, and apoptosis without addition of inhibitors of the
DNA damage response pathway. Depletion of geminin in immortalized cells or cells derived from normal tissues did not arrest their
proliferation and did not induce DNA re-replication. Moreover,
normal cells neither accumulated DNA damage nor expressed DNA
damage control genes. Normal cells responded to geminin depletion
such as cancer cells only when they were depleted of both geminin
and cyclin A, a protein required for cell cycle–dependent CDK
phosphorylation of preRC proteins. These and other results show that
regulation of CDT1 activity by geminin is rate limiting for initiation of
DNA replication only in certain cancer cells, and provide clear
evidence for the supposition that suppression of geminin activity
could be used to selectively kill cancer cells under conditions that do
not affect growth and proliferation of normal cells.

dermal fibroblasts D-1 and primary epidermal keratinocytes K-1 were
provided by Dr. Jonathon Vogel (National Cancer Institute/NIH, Bethesda,
MD). 786-O was provided by Dr. Marston Linehan (National Cancer
Institute/NIH, Bethesda, MD). D-1 cells were maintained in DMEM
supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. K-1 were maintained in
Keratinocyte Medium (ScienCell). MCF10A and H1299 cells were kindly
provided by Dr. Z. Sheng Guo (University of Pittsburgh Cancer Institute,
Pittsburgh, PA). H1299 cells were maintained in DMEM supplemented with
10% fetal bovine serum, and MCF10A cells were maintained MCF10A breast
cells were grown in a serum-free MEGM (Mammary Epithelial Growth
Medium) supplemented with a MEGM bullet kit (Lonza, cc3150).
siRNA. Short interfering oligoribonucleotides (Dharmacon) for luciferase
(siGL2) and cyclin A (siCCNA) were as previously described (6, 7). Three
siRNAs targeted against geminin RNA were siGEM (UGCCAACUCUGGAAUCAAA; ref. 7), siGEM2 (AACUUCCAGCCCUGGGGUUAU; ref. 28), and
siGEM3 (AAUCACUGGAUAAUCAGGAAU). Transfections were performed
with 20 to 50 nmol/L siRNA oligonucleotide duplexes using Oligofectamine
(Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. In brief, cells 50%
to 60% confluent were transfected twice (0 and 24 h later) for 4 h per
transfection before adding fresh medium and then harvested 48 h after the
first transfection, unless otherwise indicated.
Fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis. Fluorescence-activated
cell sorting was done on cells that were collected by trypsinization, fixed with
70% ethanol overnight at 4jC, then collected by centrifugation, stained in
50 ng propidium iodide/mL, 0.05% NP40, and 10 Ag RNase A/mL, and then
analyzed with a Becton Dickinson FACSCalibur using Cellquest software.
Protein detection. Western immunoblotting was done using Rabbit
antigeminin Geminin (FL-209; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), rabbit anti-actin
(A2066; Sigma), rabbit anti–glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase
(G9545; Sigma). Mouse anti-p53 (Sigma), rabbit anti-p53 phosphorylated at
serine15 (Cell Signaling), rabbit anti-p21 (C-19; Santa Cruz), and rabbit anticyclin A (H432; Santa Cruz) were used for immunoblotting. Rabbit antiHsCDT1 antibody was a gift from Dr. Anindya Dutta (University of Virginia
Medical School, Charlottesville, VA). Cells were washed twice in PBS and then
sonicated in radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer. Proteins were fractionated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose, and incubated with the
indicated antibodies. For immunofluorescence cells were fixed with 2%
paraformaldehyde in PBS for 10 min, permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100
for 10 min at room temperature, and then washed and mounted with solution
containing 4¶,6¶-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI; Vector Laboratories).
Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase–mediated dUTP nick end
labeling assay. Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase–mediated dUTP nick
end labeling (TUNEL) assays were performed according to manufacturer’s
instructions (Roche manual). Briefly, cells were washed thrice in PBS, and
fixed in freshly prepared 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 1 h at room
temperature, and then washed with PBS and permeabilized in 0.1% Triton
X-100 in 0.1% sodium citrate. Cells were then incubated with TUNEL reaction
mixture (Roche) for 60 min at 37jC in a humidified atmosphere in the dark.
After washing twice with PBS, cells were mounted in a DAPI solution (Vector
Laboratories). A positive control run in parallel consisted of permeabilized
cells that had been incubated with DNase I (1 U/AL) for 10 min at room
temperature to introduce DNA strand breaks before the TUNEL assay.

Results
Geminin depletion selectively induced DNA re-replication in
cancer cells. Previous studies (7) have shown that siRNA targeted
against geminin (siGem) can induce DNA re-replication in HCT116
cells derived from a colorectal carcinoma, as evidenced by
increased DNA content and the appearance of giant nuclei. To
determine whether or not this result was unique to these cells, their
response to siGem was compared with the response of three other
colon cancer cells (SW480, COLO 320DM, and DLD-1; Supplementary Table S1). In each case, geminin was reduced at least 10-fold
by siGem (Supplementary Fig. S3; Fig. 1). The fraction of cells
with greater than 4N DNA increased 7 to 11-fold within 2 days of

siGem transfection, as judged by FACS analysis, and the number
of giant nuclei detected by microscopy increased 14- to 25-fold
(Supplementary Fig. S3; Fig. 1). In total, from 30% to 50% the
cells in each population underwent DNA re-replication, a proportion equivalent to the population of cells in S and G2-M
phases of the cell cycle (those phases in which geminin is
present). In contrast, transfection with siRNA targeted against
firefly luciferase (siGL2), a gene not encoded by mammals, did
not affect these parameters.
To determine whether or not siGem had the same effect on
noncarcinogenic colon cells, the experiment was repeated with
cells derived from normal fetal colon tissue (CCD841 CoN and FHC
cells; Supplementary Table S1). Again, siGem reduced the level of
geminin protein in these cells at least 10-fold (Fig. 1). However, no
change was detected either in the fraction of normal colon cells
with greater than 4N DNA content, or in the fraction of normal
colon cells with giant nuclei (Fig. 1), Thus, geminin depletion
induced DNA re-replication in colorectal cancer cells but not in
their normal epithelial counterparts (summarized in Table 1).
To determine whether or not similar results would be obtained
with other tissues, the same experiment was carried out with
epithelial and fibroblast cells from breast, lung, kidney, bone, brain,
skin, and cervix (Supplementary Table S1). In each case, siGem
reduced geminin levels by f10-fold. Nevertheless, of the 10 cell
types derived from normal tissues, and the 13 cell types derived
from cancer tissues, only those cells derived from cancers were
induced to re-replicate their DNA upon geminin depletion

(Supplementary Figs. S1–S5; Table 1). Otherwise, no change was
detected either in the fraction of cells with greater than 4N DNA, or
in the fraction of giant nuclei. Surprisingly, two cells derived from
normal tissues but later immortalized by constitutive expression of
SV40 large tumor antigen (293T and hGOB 1.19) also were not
induced to re-replicate their DNA in response to geminin depletion.
Because 293T cells are tumorigenic but nonmetastatic (32), only
cancer cells seem to be sensitive to geminin depletion. However,
two skin melanoma cells (WM-266-4 and A375) as well as the
frequently studied cervix adenocarcinoma HeLa cells also were
resistant to induction of DNA re-replication in response to geminin
depletion. In contrast, cells derived from breast adenocarcinoma
(MCF7), lung carcinoma (H1299), kidney adenocarcinoma (786-O),
osteosarcoma (U2OS), and brain glioblastoma (U87 MG; Y98G)
were as sensitive to geminin depletion as were cells derived from
colon cancers.
Simply stated, cells derived from normal tissues, including those
that were subsequently immortalized by a viral oncogene, seemed
unaffected by geminin depletion, whereas cells derived from cancers
underwent DNA re-replication. Moreover, not all cells derived from
cancers were sensitive to siGem; cervix adenocarcinoma and skin
melanoma cells were as insensitive to geminin depletion as were
normal and immortalized cells. These results were obtained with
three different siRNAs directed against different sites within the
geminin structural gene (Supplementary Fig. S7). Thus, DNA rereplication in these cells resulted from increased CDT1 activity as a
consequence of reduced geminin activity.

Selective Killing of Cancer Cells

Figure 2. Geminin depletion suppressed cancer cell
proliferation and induced apoptosis. A, colon carcinoma
HCT116 cells were transfected with either siGem (n) or
siGL2 (5), harvested at indicated times posttransfection,
and the total number of cells was recorded. B, cells treated
as in A were subjected to Western immunoblotting for
geminin. C, the fraction of cells in A that remained attached
to the dish with giant nuclei was determined by fluorescent
microscopy. D, total cells (attached plus unattached) in A
were analyzed by FACS. Percentage with less than 2N
DNA content, and the percentage with greater than 4N
DNA content are indicated.

DNA re-replication suppressed cell proliferation by inducing
apoptosis. To determine the effect of DNA re-replication on cell
proliferation, HCT116 cells were transfected either with siGL2 or
with siGem and then harvested at various times posttransfection.
The population of cells transfected with siGL2 increased f350-fold
by 8 days with a doubling time of 18 to 20 hours, and geminin levels
in these cells remained constant (Fig. 2A and B). In contrast,
geminin levels were suppressed within 2 days of the first
transfection with siGem (Fig. 2B), and they did not begin to
proliferate (Fig. 2A) until their geminin levels were restored to
normal f6 days after the first transfection. Similarly, depletion of
geminin suppressed cell proliferation in cells derived from colon
adenocarcinoma (DLD-1), non–small lung carcinoma (H1299), and
mammary gland adenocarcinoma (MCF7), but not in five normal
cells (Fig. 4D).
The failure of geminin-depleted cancer cells to proliferate
resulted from induction of apoptosis. Two characteristics of
apoptosis are loss of cell adhesion and reduction in DNA content.
Cells with giant nuclei appeared within 2 days of siGem
transfection and then detached from the dish and disintegrated
(Fig. 2C). Because cells were cultured in the absence of siGem, their
place was taken by new cells that expressed geminin. FACS analysis
confirmed that geminin depletion induced DNA re-replication in
cancer cells within 2 days, but within 4 days, cells with >4N DNA
content disappeared, and cells with <2N DNA content took their
place (Fig. 2D). In contrast, cells transfected with siGL2 remained
typical of proliferating cell populations (Fig. 2D) and did not
accumulate cells with giant nuclei (Fig. 2C).
To confirm that siGem induced apoptosis in cancer cells,
geminin-depleted HCT116 cells were assayed both for nuclear DNA

www.aacrjournals.org

fragmentation and for a rounded cell morphology with blebbing,
two additional characteristics of apoptosis (33). Nuclear DNA
fragmentation was detected with the TUNEL assay in which
terminal deoxyribonucleotidyl transferase is used to label free
3¶-OH–terminated DNA fragments with fluorescein-conjugated
dUTP. HCT116 cells with giant nuclei were TUNEL positive,
whereas HCT116 cells with normal nuclei were not (Fig. 3A). This
was consistent with previous studies in which DNA strand breaks
were detected in cells undergoing DNA re-replication (6). TUNELpositive nuclei were not detected in HCT116 cells treated with
siGL2 (Fig. 3A). Cells with giant nuclei exhibited a rounded cell
morphology with multiple blebs, whereas cells with normal nuclei
did not (Supplementary Fig. S6).
Geminin depletion induces DNA re-replication in cancer cells,
regardless of the presence or absence of the tumor suppressor
protein p53, but p53+/+ cancer cells induce expression and
phosphorylation of p53, as well as expression of the CDK-specific
inhibitor p21 whose transcription is p53 dependent (Fig. 3B; ref. 7).
These events are part of the DNA damage response in mammalian
cells, as shown by treatment of cells with etoposide, a specific
inhibitor of topoisomerase II that induces DNA breaks (Fig. 3B).
Thus, induction of DNA re-replication by siGem in cells from
cancers resulted in apoptosis within 4 to 8 days posttransfection.
Geminin depletion did not affect normal cell proliferation.
Normal somatic cells typically proliferate slowly compared with
cancer cells. For example, normal breast AG11132 cells doubled
in 38 to 40 hours, whereas breast adenocarcinoma MCF7 cells
doubled in 30 to 32 hours. Normal colon FHC cells doubled in
39 hours, whereas colon carcinoma HCT116 cells required only 18
to 20 hours. Because differences in the time required for cell

division in mammalian cells reflect differences in the length of their
G1 phase, the absence of DNA re-replication in normal cells treated
with siGem may result simply from fewer S, G2, and M phase cells,
the only cells expressing geminin protein. In that case, normal cells
may simply require more time to respond to geminin depletion.
However, this was not the case.
The rate of proliferation for normal primary skin D1 fibroblasts
was not affected significantly by siGem relative to siGL2 (Fig. 4A),
despite the fact that geminin levels were reduced markedly in cells
transfected with siGem but not in cells transfected with siGL2
(Fig. 4B). Furthermore, recovery of geminin expression in D1 cells
transfected with siGem (Fig. 4B) followed the same time course as
observed with HCT116 cells (Fig. 2B). FACS profiles for both siGL2
and siGem-treated D1 cells were characteristic of proliferating cell
populations, and they exhibited no significant change in the
fraction of cells containing >4N DNA (Fig. 4C).
To determine whether or not normal cells accumulated DNA
damage in response to geminin depletion, each cell type was
treated with either siGL2 or siGem and then assayed for nuclear
DNA fragmentation. Under conditions that readily detected
TUNEL-positive cells in cancer cells treated with siGem, no
TUNEL-positive cells were detected in normal cells such as D1
(Fig. 3A), and other noncarcinogenic cells such as colon CCD841
CoN, lung WI-38, breast AG11132, and MCF10A (data not shown;
Fig. 4D). Moreover, the amount of p53 in normal cells was not
increased by geminin depletion and p53 was not phosphorylated.
Moreover, siGem did not induce expression of p21 (Fig. 3B).
Therefore, siGem did not induce genotoxic stress in normal cells
under conditions where it did so in cancer cells.
Sensitivity to siGem did not correlate with cellular levels of
either geminin or CDT1. The simplest explanation for why
geminin depletion induces DNA re-replication in cancer cells but
not in normal cells is that the ratio of CDT1 to geminin is increased
to a greater extent in cancer cells than in normal cells. To assess
this possibility, geminin and CDT1 protein levels were assayed
before and after geminin depletion in normal skin D1 cells and in
colon carcinoma HCT116 cells (Fig. 5). Geminin-depleted D1 cells
experienced a 3- to 4-fold decrease in CDT1, although the ratio of
CDT1 to geminin actually increased 5-fold. Similarly, geminindepleted HCT116 cells experienced at least a 10-fold decrease
in CDT1 (as previously reported; ref. 7), although with little, if
any, change in the CDT1/geminin ratio. Therefore, the ability
of geminin depletion to induce DNA re-replication in HCT116
cells, but not in D1 cells, did not correlate with increased CDT1
protein levels.
The levels of geminin and CDT1 protein were compared in other
cells as well. As expected, the levels of both geminin and CDT1
were f5-fold greater in colon cancer cells (HCT116, DLD-1,
SW480, and COLO320DM) than in normal colon cells (CCD841CoN
and FHC), and the ratios of geminin to CDT1 in each of these cells
was essentially unchanged (Supplementary Fig. S8A). As expected,
cell populations with high geminin levels contained a greater
proportion of cells in S and G2-M phases than cell populations with
lower geminin levels (Supplementary Fig. S8B). Normal skin D1
cells were similar to normal colon cells. Therefore, one would not
expect depletion of geminin to be more injurious to cancer cells
than to normal cells.
On the other hand, normal breast cells (AG11132, AG11134, and
MCF10A) exhibited higher geminin levels but lower CDT1 levels
than breast adenocarcinoma MCF7 cells (Supplementary Fig. S8A).
Again, these results were consistent with the relative fraction of

Cancer Res 2009; 69: (11). June 1, 2009

cells in S and G2-M phases (Supplementary Fig. S8B). Thus, a
simple correlation between geminin levels, geminin to CDT1 ratios,
and sensitivity to geminin depletion was not apparent. Normal
colon cells contained low levels of geminin, because they consisted
predominantly of G1 phase cells, and normal breast cells contained
high levels of geminin, because they contained a higher proportion
of proliferating cells, but neither cell type underwent DNA rereplication when transfected with siGem.
Induction of DNA re-replication in normal cells required
suppression of multiple regulatory pathways. Several different
but convergent pathways have been described that contribute to
restricting genome duplication to once each time a cell divides
(3, 4, 13). At least three of them involve CDK-dependent
phosphorylation of preRC proteins, and in metazoa, cyclin A is

Figure 3. Only cells that re-replicated their DNA experienced genotoxic
stress and apoptosis. A, colon carcinoma HCT116 cells were transfected with
either siGL2 or siGem. At 4 d posttransfection, cells not attached to the dish were
isolated by centrifugation and subjected to the TUNEL assay. HCT116 cells
treated with DNase I provided a TUNEL-positive control. Normal skin D1 cells
were treated likewise. B, the indicated cells were treated with either siGL2 or
siGem as in Fig. 1, and then subjected to Western immunoblotting for the
indicated protein (p53-P is p53 phosphorylated on serine 15). To show the
effects of genotoxic stress, p53+/+ HCT116 cells were treated with 3 Amol/L
etoposide (ETP ) for 16 h in parallel with HCT116 cells treated with the same
buffered solvent (DMSO). Longer exposures revealed p53 in HCT116 cells, and
shorter exposures confirmed that p53 levels in AG11132 and MCF10A cells
remained unchanged.

the principle activator of CDK activities that suppress DNA rereplication. To determine whether or not suppression of multiple
pathways induces DNA re-replication in normal cells, D1 cells were
treated with both siGem and siRNA-targeted against cyclin A
(siCcnA). Remarkably, this combination induced DNA re-replication in normal cells to an extent similar to that observed in
geminin-depleted HCT116 cells (Fig. 5). The response to depletion
of cyclin A alone in D1 cells was detectable but modest compared
with depletion of both cyclin A and geminin. Similar results were
obtained with normal breast (AG11132 and MCF10A) and colon
(CCD841 CoN) cells (Table 1). In contrast, the response to depletion
of both cyclin A and geminin in HCT116 cells was essentially the
same as with depletion of geminin alone. Therefore, DNA rereplication is prevented primarily by the ratio of geminin to CDT1
in HCT116 cells, whereas DNA re-replication in D1 cells is
prevented by cyclin A–dependent pathways as well as by geminin.
This conclusion was confirmed by changes in the levels of CDT1
and geminin in these experiments (Fig. 5). Depletion of cyclin A in
D1 cells did not affect the levels of either CDT1 or geminin,
whereas depletion of both cyclin A and geminin prevented loss of
CDT1 (Fig. 5), consistent with a critical role for CDT1 in DNA rereplication. However, although depletion of cyclin A did not affect
CDT1 and geminin levels in HCT116 cells, neither did it prevent
loss of CDT1 in geminin-depleted cells. Because neither siGem
nor siGem plus siCcnA increased the ratio of CDT1 to geminin in
HCT116 cells, elevation of CDT1 activity does not account for
DNA re-replication under these conditions. Both CDK and geminindependent pathways prevent DNA re-replication in normal cells,
whereas cancer cells rely primarily, if not exclusively, on geminin.

Discussion
Studies on cells from flies, frogs, plants, and mammals suggest
that CDT1 activity is the rate-limiting step in preRC assembly in
metazoa, and that geminin is the critical regulator of CDT1 activity
(reviewed in refs. 3, 18, 29, 30, 34–38). Nevertheless, exceptions have
been reported. Whereas geminin depletion induced DNA rereplication in some cancer cells (5–7), it did not do so in HeLa
(20, 39, 40), MCF10A (40), and 293T (41) cells. Moreover,
overexpression of both CDT1 and Cdc6 induced DNA re-replication
in some, but not all, lung carcinoma cells, and it did not induce
DNA re-replication in primary human and rodent cells, 293T cells,
HeLa cells, and other cervical carcinoma cell lines (19, 42). These
results suggested to us that CDT1 activity may be the rate limiting
factor for preRC assembly in rapidly proliferating cells such
cleavage stage embryos, preimplantation embryos, and cancer cells
but not in normal cells.
To test this hypothesis, siRNA targeted against the human
geminin gene was transfected into 23 different cell lines derived
from eight different human tissues (Supplementary Table S1;
Table 1). In six of these tissues, cells were derived from biopsies of
both cancers and normal tissues. Remarkably, all of the cells that
re-replicated their DNA had been derived from malignant cancers;
none were from normal tissues. Moreover, cells derived from
normal tissues that were later immortalized with SV40 T-antigen
(293T and hFOB 1.19) continued to proliferate normally even when
their geminin levels were reduced >10-fold. Similarly, three cell lines
derived from cancers (HeLa, WM-266-4, and A375) also were
insensitive to suppression of their geminin levels. We attribute these
effects to suppression of geminin synthesis, because all three of the

Figure 5. Normal cells prevent DNA re-replication through multiple
convergent pathways that are dependent on both geminin and cyclin A.
Normal skin D1 cells (A) and colon carcinoma HCT116 cells (B) were
transfected either with siGL2, siGem, siCcnA, or both siGem and siCcnA.
Cells were harvested at 2 d posttransfection and subjected to FACS analysis
to determine the fraction of cells with greater than 4N DNA content. The
same cells were subjected to Western immunoblotting to determine the
relative levels of cyclin A, CDT1, geminin, and Orc1. Protein levels were
quantified using Multi Gauge software (Fuji Film). Cdt1 and geminin protein
levels were normalized relative to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate
dehydrogenase (Gapdh), and then to either Cdt1 or geminin in siGl2-treated
cells.

siGem oligoribonucleotides tested suppressed geminin protein in
both cancer and noncancer cells, and either overexpression of a
nondegradable form of geminin (28), or cosuppression of both
CDT1 and geminin has been shown to prevent induction of DNA
re-replication by two of these same molecules (5, 7). These studies,
carried out under the same conditions using the same siRNAs,
show that whereas some cancer cells are sensitive to geminin
depletion, most primary and secondary mammalian cells are
insensitive. Therefore, drugs targeted specifically against geminin
activity should be excellent candidates to selectively induce DNA
re-replication in some forms of cancer without interfering either
with the function or proliferation of noncancer cells.
Previous studies reported that inhibition either of the ATM and
ATR protein kinases, or the CHK1 protein kinase 2 days after
siGem treatment of HCT116 cells rapidly induced apoptosis in cells
that had undergone DNA re-replication (7). Therefore, DNA rereplication induced by geminin depletion activates DNA damage
response pathways that prevent cells from entering mitosis until
the damage is repaired because suppression of this pathway

Cancer Res 2009; 69: (11). June 1, 2009

resulted in apoptosis. When these pathways are inhibited,
induction of apoptosis is immediate (6, 7). Here, we show that
induction of apoptosis occurs spontaneously within a few days of
siGem transfection without addition of protein kinase inhibitors.
Because siGem did not induce DNA re-replication, DNA damage,
or DNA damage response genes in either normal or immortalized
cells, it did not induce apoptosis. Normal cells continued to
proliferate. Therefore, inhibition of geminin activity should, in
principle, selectively kill cancer cells in vivo.
Induction of DNA re-replication by geminin depletion implies that
the level of Cdt1 activity is rate limiting for origin licensing, and that
a reduction in geminin results in an increase in Cdt1 activity.
However, suppression of geminin in either cancer or noncancer cells
resulted in a concomitant decrease of Cdt1 protein, the result of
ubiquitin-mediated degradation of Cdt1 when it is not bound to
geminin (43). Suppression of both geminin and cyclin A restored
Cdt1 protein levels to normal in noncancer cells and induced DNA
re-replication. Similar results have been reported with Drosophila
cells (27), and confirms the existence multiple, convergent pathways
that restrict genome duplication to once per cell division. For
example, CDT1 activity in humans is down-regulated during S phase
in three ways (3, 44, 45). It is phosphorylated by cyclin A:CDK2 and
then ubiquitinated by SCFskp2. It is also ubiquitinated by CDRDdb1 in
the presence of proliferating cell nuclear antigen, a protein that
stimulates DNA polymerase activity at replication forks and that also
binds to CDT1. Both reactions result in degradation of CDT1 by the
26S proteasome, although only SCF requires prior phosphorylation
of its substrate. Finally, geminin binds specifically to CDT1, thereby
inhibiting its activity while simultaneously protecting CDT1 from
ubiquitination and degradation. In addition to inactivation of CDT1,
cyclin A–dependent phosphorylation of Orc1 prevents it binding
to chromatin during mitosis, and cyclin A–dependent phosphorylation of Cdc6 affects its nuclear localization (3, 40). All of these
mechanisms could contribute to restricting genome duplication to
once per cell division in normal cells, but the fact that suppression
of geminin alone can induce DNA re-replication in some cancer
cells means that one or more of these pathways is inactive in
those cells.
Because geminin protects CDT1 from ubiquitin-dependent
degradation (43), suppression of geminin also reduced CDT1
protein levels in both normal and cancer cells. The fact that cancer
cells could still re-replicate their DNA under these conditions can
be attributed to the f10-fold excess of CDT1 (Supplementary
Fig. S8) and other preRC proteins (ref. 46)1 in cancer cells
compared with normal cells. The fact that suppression of
both geminin and cyclin A restored CDT1 levels in normal cells
but not in cancer cells (Fig. 5) suggests that normal cells use
the SCF pathway to degrade CDT1, whereas some cancer cells
use the CDR pathway. The fact that both cyclin A and geminin
prevent DNA re-replication in normal cells but only geminin prevents DNA re-replication in some cancer cells could be explained
if both SCF and geminin maintained CDT1 activity rate limiting
in normal cells, but only geminin maintained CDT1 activity rate
limiting in some cancer cells. However, this does not seem to be
the case, because overexpression of CDT1 fails to induce DNA rereplication in mammalian cells (19, 31). Therefore, either cyclin
A–dependent phosphorylation of ORC1 or CDC6 plays a role, or
