Abstract
mTOR is a highly conserved serine/threonine protein kinase that serves as a central regulator of cell growth,
survival, and autophagy. Deregulation of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway occurs commonly in cancer and
numerous inhibitors targeting the ATP-binding site of these kinases are currently undergoing clinical evaluation.
Here, we report the characterization of Torin2, a second-generation ATP-competitive inhibitor that is potent and
selective for mTOR with a superior pharmacokinetic proﬁle to previous inhibitors. Torin2 inhibited mTORC1dependent T389 phosphorylation on S6K (RPS6KB1) with an EC50 of 250 pmol/L with approximately 800-fold
selectivity for cellular mTOR versus phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K). Torin2 also exhibited potent biochemical
and cellular activity against phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase–like kinase (PIKK) family kinases including ATM (EC50,
28 nmol/L), ATR (EC50, 35 nmol/L), and DNA-PK (EC50, 118 nmol/L; PRKDC), the inhibition of which sensitized
cells to Irradiation. Similar to the earlier generation compound Torin1 and in contrast to other reported mTOR
inhibitors, Torin2 inhibited mTOR kinase and mTORC1 signaling activities in a sustained manner suggestive of a
slow dissociation from the kinase. Cancer cell treatment with Torin2 for 24 hours resulted in a prolonged block in
negative feedback and consequent T308 phosphorylation on Akt. These effects were associated with strong
growth inhibition in vitro. Single-agent treatment with Torin2 in vivo did not yield signiﬁcant efﬁcacy against
KRAS-driven lung tumors, but the combination of Torin2 with mitogen-activated protein/extracellular signal–
regulated kinase (MEK) inhibitor AZD6244 yielded a signiﬁcant growth inhibition. Taken together, our ﬁndings
establish Torin2 as a strong candidate for clinical evaluation in a broad number of oncologic settings where mTOR
signaling has a pathogenic role. Cancer Res; 73(8); 2574–86. 2013 AACR.

The mTOR is a highly conserved and widely expressed
serine/threonine kinase that is a member of the phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase–like kinase (PIKK) family, which includes the
serine/threonine kinases ATR, ATM, DNA-PK, and SMG-1 (1,
2). mTOR serves as a pivotal node in the PI3K/Akt/mTOR
signaling pathway, which senses growth factor and nutrient
signals and controls fundamental cellular processes such cell
growth, autophagy, translation, and metabolism (3, 4). Hyperactivation of this pathway through loss of negative regulators,
such as PTEN, or mutational activation of receptor tyrosine
kinases of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) is a frequent
occurrence in cancer (5). mTOR exists in at least 2 multiprotein
complexes, which are named mTORC1 and mTORC2 (6, 7).
mTORC1 contains mTOR, mLST8, and raptor as core
components and regulates cell growth, protein synthesis, and
autophagy through its downstream effectors, including S6K1,
4EBP1, and ATG13. mTORC2 consists of mTOR, mLST8,
rictor, PRR5, and SIN1 as core components and regulates cell
survival and actin organization through effectors such as Akt,
SGK1, and PKCa. Through its inclusion in these 2 protein
complexes mTOR functions both upstream of Akt through

PIKK Inhibitor Torin2 with Antitumor Activity

mTORC2-dependent phosphorylation of S473 located in the
hydrophobic-motif and downstream of Akt in the context of
mTORC1 (4).
Rapamycin, a Streptomyces-derived natural product that is
an allosteric inhibitor of mTORC1, has been critical to understanding the functions of mTOR (8). Rapamycin acts by forming a complex with the small 12 kDa protein FKBP-12, and
binding to the FRB domain of mTOR, acutely inhibiting
mTORC1 activity (9). Rapamycin does not acutely inhibit the
activity of mTORC2, although prolonged treatment can disrupt
its activity by destabilizing complex formation (10). Prolonged
suppression of mTORC1 also results in disruption of a negative
feedback loop and consequently results in hyperphosphorylation of Akt through activation of IRS1 and PI3K (11). Although
rapamycin was long thought to completely disable mTORC1
activity, a new class of ATP competitive mTOR inhibitors, such
as Torin1 and PP242, have revealed that many mTORC1
functions, such as phosphorylation of the 4EBP family of
translational repressors, are resistant to rapamycin (12–14).
Moreover, this new class of inhibitors also potently targets
mTORC2. Together, these features have generated hope that
the new generation of ATP-competitive mTOR inhibitors will
exhibit broader clinical efﬁcacy relative to the rapalogs.
Many members of this new class of ATP-competitive mTOR
inhibitors have been developed using previously identiﬁed
PI3K inhibitors as starting points. For example, LY294002, one
of the original and most frequently used PI3K inhibitors, is
structurally related to many dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitors,
including SF1126, GSK1059615, BEZ235, XL765, PKI-587, PF04691502, GSK2126458, and PKI-179, several of which have
been advanced into clinical trials (15–22). mTOR inhibitors
with little or no activity against PI3K, such as Torin1, PP242,
WYE354, and KU63794 have served as important research tools
to advance the basic understanding of the mTOR signaling
pathway and AZD8055, WYE-125132, INK-128, and OSI-027 are
currently undergoing clinical evaluation (23–28). Here, we
report detailed cellular and in vivo evaluation of Torin2, a
compound recently developed to overcome the pharmacologic
limitations of Torin1. Chemical proteomic proﬁling followed
by cellular pathway proﬁling shows that Torin2, unlike Torin1,
is also a potent inhibitor of ATR, ATM, and DNA-PK (29–31).
Torin2 displays dramatic antiproliferative activity across a
panel of cancer cell lines and elicited a combinatorial response
with the mitogen-activated protein/extracellular signal–regulated kinase (MEK) kinase inhibitor AZD6244 against genetically engineered mutant KRAS-driven lung tumors.

Materials and Methods
Inhibitors
Torin1 and Torin2 were prepared as previously described
(13, 29). AZD8055, PP242, and staurosporine were purchased
from Haoyuan Chemexpress Co. Acridine orange was purchased from Invitrogen.
ATP competition assay
Human mTORC1 complex was obtained as reported (12). In
vitro mTORC1 activity was assayed using the Lanthascreen

www.aacrjournals.org

time-resolved FRET assay (Invitrogen). Brieﬂy, mTORC1 was
incubated with serially diluted inhibitors (3-fold, 10 points) for
30 minutes in 5 mL of kinase buffer [25 mmol/L HEPES, pH 7.4, 8
mmol/L MgCl2, 6 mmol/L MnCl2, 4 mmol/L dithiothreitol
(DTT)] in a 384-well low-volume white plate (Corning). The
kinase reaction was initiated by the addition of an equal
volume of the kinase buffer containing 0.6 mmol/L GFP-labeled
4E-BP1 and 20 mmol/L ATP. After incubation at room temperature for 90 minutes, the reaction was stopped by the
addition of a 5 mL of solution containing 45 mmol/L EDTA
and 4.5 nmol/L Tb-labeled antiphospho-4E-BP1 (T46) antibody. After 30 minutes, the FRET signal between Tb and GFP
within the immune complex was read using an Envision plate
reader (PerkinElmer). Each data point was duplicated and IC50
values were calculated using Prism4 software (GraphPad). For
ATP competitiveness test, IC50 values were determined at a
range of ATP concentrations in duplicate.
Immunoblot assays
ATR, ATM, and DNA-PK cellular activity: HCT-116 Cells were
seeded in 6-well plates (0.5  106/well) and grown overnight.
After 1 hour of pretreatment with appropriate compounds at
37 C, culture media was removed and saved. For ATR assay, the
cells were treated with 50 mJ of UV radiation energy using
strata linker (10 gray Ionizing radiation for ATM and DNA-PK
assay). The culture media were added back to the cells and
incubated at 37 C. After 1 hour, cells were rinsed once with icecold PBS and lysed in ice-cold lysis buffer [40 mmol/L HEPES
(pH 7.4), 2 mmol/L EDTA, 10 mmol/L pyrophosphate, 10
mmol/L glycerophosphate, 1% Triton X-100, and 1 tablet of
EDTA-free protease inhibitors per 25 mL]. The soluble fractions
of cell lysates were then isolated by centrifugation at 13,000 rpm
for 10 minutes in a microcentrifuge. After the lysates from all
the plates were collected, the concentration of the protein was
normalized by Bradford assay. Fifty-microliter sample buffer
was added to the normalized lysates and boiled for 5 minutes.
Samples were subsequently analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. Results are shown in Fig. 1C–E.
Biochemical and cellular mTOR kinase assays
In vitro assay. mTORC1 was incubated with inhibitors
[0.5 mmol/L, 1% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)] in 5 mL of reaction
buffer (25 mmol/L HEPES pH 7.4, 8 mmol/L MgCl2 and 6
mmol/L MnCl2) for 1 hour at room temperature. Then, drug–
ATP competition was induced by the addition of 245 mL of the
reaction buffer containing 500 mmol/L ATP, 4 mmol/L DTT,
and 0.3 mmol/L GFP-4EBP1 (Invitrogen). The reaction mixture
was dispensed (10 mL, triplicate) into a low volume white plate
(Corning) and the kinase reaction was stopped at various times
with 5 mL of stop solution (Invitrogen). The stop solution (5 mL)
containing 4 nmol/L Tb-labeled p-4EBP1 (T46) antibody (Invitrogen) was added, then the FRET signal was read using
Envision (PerkinElmer) after 30 minutes of incubation. Results
are shown in Fig. 2A.
Cellular assay. HCT116 cells were treated with 100
nmol/L Torin2 or AZD8055 for 1 hour before they were
thoroughly washed out by 3 PBS and 1 Dulbecco's Modiﬁed
Eagle's Medium (DMEM) medium. Then cells were incubated

and analyzed by Western blot analysis using anti-LC3B and
anti-tubulin antibodies. Results are shown in Fig. 3C–E.
Fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis
Hela S3 cells were treated with Torin1, Torin2, or DMSO
control for 48 hours. Cells were trypsinized, washed once in
PBS, and ﬁxed overnight at 20 C with 80% ethanol in PBS.
Cells were washed 3 times with PBS. Finally, cells were resuspended in PBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100, 25 mg/mL propidium iodide (Molecular Probes), and 0.2 mg/mL RNase A
(Sigma) and incubated for 45 minutes at 37 C. Samples were
then analyzed and results are shown in Fig. 3F.
Tumor cell growth assay
All lung cancer cell lines (H2122, H358, H1792, A549, H441,
H1355, H460, H226, H1299, and H292) were purchased from
American Type Culture Collection (ATCC). Cells were cultured
in RPMI-1640 media with 10% FBS at 37 C with 5% CO2. A total
of 2,000 cells of each well were seeded in 96-well plate (BD
Falcon, #353936). After cells attachment, the drugs were added
into the plate and then incubated the cells for 72 hours. A total
of 10 mL/well CCK-8 reagent (DOJINDO, #CK04-11) was added
into 96-well plate and incubated cells for 2 hours. After
incubation, the 450-nm absorbance was measured by using
650 nm as reference. All data were calculated by GraphPad
Prism5 software to get IC50 of each drug.
All breast cancer cell lines (BT20, HS578T, MCF10A, MCF7,
MDAMB231, and SKBR3) were purchased from ATCC. Cells
were plated in 96-well microscopy plates (Corning) and plated
in recommended media at 3,000 cells per well. After 24 hours,
cells were treated with different concentrations of inhibitor and
incubated for 72 hours. Cells were ﬁxed in 2% paraformaldehyde for 10 minutes at room temperature and washed with PBST (PBS, 0.1% Tween 20). Cells were washed once in PBS-T, once
in PBS, and incubated in 250 ng/mL Hoechst 33342 (Invitrogen)

and 1:1,000 Whole Cell Stain (blue; Thermo Scientiﬁc) solution
for 15 minutes. Cells were then washed 2 times with PBS and
imaged in an imageWoRx high-throughput microscope
(Applied Precision). The images were analyzed using ImageRail
and the average GI50 of 6 experiments was calculated using
DataPﬂex (33, 34). Results are shown in Table 1.
Combination study
Human non–small cell lung cancer cell lines H226, H358, and
Calu-1 were grown in RPMI-1640/10% FBS/1% pen/strep/2
mmol/L L-glutamine at 37 C in a humidiﬁed incubator with 5%
CO2. To do combinational inhibition analysis, cells were plated
into 96-well plates at 2,000 cells per well in 100-mL medium
containing 4-fold serial dilution of AZD starting from 10 to
0.002 mmol/L and/or Torin2 starting from 0.2 to 0.04 mmol/L.
After 3-day incubation, viable cells were counted using celltiter-glo (Promega). All reactions were carried out in triplicate.
Results are shown in Fig. 4
Mice cohort and drug treatment
Mice harboring a conditional activating mutation Lox-StopLox-Kras (G12D) allele (35) were housed in a pathogen-free
environment at the Harvard School of Public Health (Boston,
MA) and were handled in strict accordance with Good Animal
Practice as deﬁned by the Ofﬁce of Laboratory Animal Welfare,
and all animal work was done with Dana-Farber Cancer Institute (Boston, MA) Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee approval. Mice were given Ad-Cre by nasal inhalation at 5
to 7 weeks of age to induce Kras G12D expression. After initial
imaging, the mice bearing tumor were given Torin2 (40 mpg)
or/and AZD6244 (25 mpg) garage daily. Torin2 was suspended
in saline; AZD6244 was reconstituted in 0.5% methylcellulose
(Fluka) and 0.4% polysorbate (Tween 80; Fluka).
MRI and PET/CT study
The mice were imaged by MRI biweekly to determine the
reduction in tumor volume during the respective treatments,

quantiﬁcation were reconstructed using 3D slicer software
(http://www.slicer.org; ref. 37). The early effects of singleagent (AZD or Torin2) or combined dual-agent treatments on
tumor glucose uses were studied in vivo using 2[18F]ﬂuoro-2deoxy-D-glucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET).
Each selected Kras tumor-bearing mouse underwent both
baseline and post-Rx FDG-PET imaging, the latter of which
was conducted after only 2 doses of respective single- or

PIKK Inhibitor Torin2 with Antitumor Activity

selective mTOR inhibitor (Fig. 1A; ref. 29). Biochemical kinase
assays with increasing ATP concentrations show that Torin2
inhibits mTOR in an ATP-competitive fashion (Fig. 1B). To
broadly survey the cellular targets of Torin2, we subjected the
compound to proﬁling using the Kinativ chemical proteomics
methodology (30). In this assay, the ability of Torin2 to protect
kinases and other nucleotide-dependent enzymes from labeling with an electrophilic ATP–biotin compound in cellular
lysates is measured using mass spectrometry. Kinativ proﬁling
provides the most comprehensive coverage currently available
for PIKK-family kinases, which bear the greatest homology to
the ATP-binding site of mTOR. Comparison proﬁling of Torin2
and Torin1 revealed that Torin2 exhibits an apparent IC50 of
less than 10 nmol/L against many PIKK family members
including mTOR, ATR, ATM, and DNA-PK as well as PI3Ka,
whereas Torin1 only strongly inhibits ATR, mTOR, and DNA-PK
(Table 2 and full list shown in Supplementary Table S1; ref. 40).
To determine which of these targets are inhibited in a
cellular context, we analyzed the phosphorylation status of
downstream substrates following cellular treatment. As
expected, T389 of S6K, a downstream target of TORC1, was
potently inhibited with an EC50 of 250 pmol/L and S473 of AKT,
a downstream target of mTORC2, was potently inhibited with
an EC50 of less than 10 nmol/L (Fig. 1C; ref. 13). Torin2 potently
inhibits T308 of Akt, a direct substrate of PDK1 and an indirect
substrate of PI3Ks, with an EC50 of less than 10 nmol/L. When
the mTORC2 contribution to Akt phosphorylation is abrogated
by introduction of a S473D mutant of Akt, the apparent EC50
against T308 is 200 nmol/L. This shows that Torin2 potently
blocks the phosphorylation of Akt at both T308 and S473 sites
and that the compound exhibits approximately 100-fold more
potent functional inhibition of mTOR relative to PI3K activity
(Fig. 1C and D and Supplementary Fig. S1). Torin2 inhibited the
cellular activity of ATR with an EC50 of 35 nmol/L as assessed
by phosphorylation status of S317 of Chk1 following exposure
of the cells to UV-induced DNA damage (Fig. 1E). Torin2
inhibited the cellular activity of ATM with an EC50 of 28
nmol/L as assessed by phosphorylation status of Chk2 following exposure of cells to 10 gray ionizing radiation. Torin2 also
inhibited DNA-PK with an EC50 of 118 nmol/L as assessed by
phosphorylation status of S2056 of DNA-PK following exposure

of cells to 10 gray ionizing radiation. In addition, torin2 shows
a dose-dependent sensitization of the ionizing radiation treatment of the human ﬁbroblast cell line AG01522, which is
presumably due to the inhibition of the ATM or DNA-PK
(Fig. 1F). The combined biochemical and cellular proﬁling
results establish that Torin2 is a broadly active pan-PIKK
family kinase inhibitor that most potently inhibits mTORC1
and mTORC2 at concentrations of less than 10 nmol/L but that
also inhibits ATR, ATM, and DNA-PK at concentrations of
between 20 and 100 nmol/L and that can inhibit PI3K at
concentrations above 200 nmol/L. In contrast, Torin1 only
exhibits moderate inhibition of DNA-PK (250 nmol/L) but is
inactive against other PIKK-family kinases.
Torin2 displays slow off-rate kinetics
Torin1 has previously been shown to display sustained
inhibition of mTORC1 in biochemical and cellular assays,
presumably as a result of slow dissociation from the complex
(40). The ability of Torin2 to inhibit mTORC1 kinase activity in a
time-dependent fashion showed that Torin2 exhibited sustained inhibition of mTORC1, similar to what has been
observed to Torin1 and in contrast to other ATP-competitive
inhibitors such as PP242 (Fig. 2A). After removal of drug, the
ability of mTORC1 to phosphorylate 4EBP1 was measured.
Under these assay conditions, Torin1 showed sustained inhibition of mTORC1 kinase activity for approximately 75 minutes
in contrast to PP242, which showed full recovery of activity
within this time. Treatment of cells with Torin2 for 1 hour
followed by "wash-out" (washing of cells and switching them
into drug-free media) showed that mTORC1 function—as
measured by the phosphorylation status of S6KT389—and
mTORC2 function—as monitored by the phosphorylation status of AktS473—required approximately 4 hours to recover,
whereas phosphorylation of both of these targets was regained
within 1 hour following treatment with another ATP-competitive mTOR inhibitor, AZD8055 (Fig. 2B and C; ref. 25). Interestingly, recovery of AktT308 phosphorylation, which is downstream of PI3K, displayed similar kinetics for both compounds
suggesting that Torin2 does not display prolonged inhibition of
PI3K. The results suggest that Torin2 displays prolonged kinetics for inhibition of mTOR in biochemical and cellular contexts.

Torin2 limits negative feedback reactivation of Akt
Prolonged treatment of cells with rapamycin is well known
to result in hyperphosphorylation of Akt as a result of inhibition of the S6K/IRS-1/Akt negative feedback loop (11). To
determine whether ATP-competitive mTOR inhibitors elicit
a similar response, we examined the ability of Torin2 and
AZD8055 to inhibit phosphorylation of AktT308, AktS473, and
S6KT389 over a 72-hour time course in HCT116 and HeLa cells
(Fig. 2D and E and Supplementary Fig. S2). Treatment with
Torin2 at 100 nmol/L was able to maintain strong suppression
of both mTORC1 (S6KT389) and mTORC2 (AktS473) throughout the time course, however, by 72 hours the phosphorylation
of AktT308 was partially (HCT116) or completely recovered
(HeLa). The data show that this feedback loop can reactivate
Akt as assessed by T308 phosphorylation status despite potent
inhibition of both mTORC1 and mTORC2. Treatment with 100
nmol/L AZD8055 also suppressed both mTORC1 and mTORC2
activity, however, the phosphorylation of T308 of Akt recovered
more quickly.
Torin2 inhibits proliferation of cancer cell, progression
of the cell cycle, and induces apoptosis and autophagy
Torin2 displays 2- to 3-digit nanomolar GI50s for inhibition of
proliferation of a diverse panel of cancer lines including lung,
breast, colorectal, and cervical (Table 1). In a 72-hour proliferation assay, Torin2 exhibits greater antiproliferative activity
relative to AZD8055 in all 5 tested cancer cell lines (Fig. 3A).
While the majority of tested cancer cell lines are potently
inhibited, we did ﬁnd 1 lung cancer cell line, Calu1, which was
relatively more resistant to both Torin2 and AZD8055. Both
Torin2 and AZD8055 could induce apoptosis as measured by
PARP cleavage at concentrations of 0.5 or 1 mmol/L in cells that
exhibited strong inhibition of proliferation (HCT116, Hela) but
much less in cells that were resistant (Calu 1 and H226),
whereas only Torin2 induced strong apoptosis in H358 (Fig.
3B).
Both rapamycin and AZD8055 are potent inducers of autophagy (24), and so we also asked whether Torin2 would affect
this process. The effect of Torin2 on autophagosome formation
in Hela cells was ﬁrst assessed by measuring the formation of
punctate acidic vesicles in the cytoplasm using acridine orange
as an indicator (Fig. 3C). A dose-dependent increase in punctate acridine staining was observed after 72 hours, consistent
with induction of autophagy. A dose-dependent increase of
LC3-1/II autophagosome markers was also observed in 5
different cell lines including HCT-116, Hela, Calu-1, H358, and
H226 (Fig. 3D and E). Cell-cycle analysis using ﬂow cytometry
showed that Torin2 induced a dose-dependent decrease in G1
cells and an increase in S-phase, sub-G1 phase cells, and cell
death (Fig. 3F and Supplementary Table S2).
Torin2 and the MEK inhibitor AZD6244 synergistically
suppress proliferation
Our cellular proﬁling results suggest that cell lines carrying
mutations in KRAS (such as H226, H358, and Calu-1) were
somewhat less sensitive to Torin2 than other lines. Given that
these lines show strong activation of the Ras/Raf/Mek/Erk
pathway, we investigated the potential combinatorial effect of

2582

Cancer Res; 73(8) April 15, 2013

Torin2 with the potent allosteric MEK inhibitor AZD6244 (41).
A 1:50 molar ratio of Torin2 to AZD6244 at concentrations that
inhibited both mTORC1 and MEK activity resulted in the most
differential growth inhibition relative to treatment with the
single agents (Fig. 4 and Supplementary Table S3).
Antitumor efﬁcacy of combined Torin2/AZD6244
treatment in a KRAS-driven model of lung cancer
The potent antiproliferative effect of the Torin2/AZD6244
combination in vitro suggested the possibility of similar efﬁcacy in vivo. To determine whether Torin2 inhibits mTOR in
vivo, we conducted a 2-day pharmacodynamics assay following
a single daily dosing of 40 mg/kg in a genetically engineered
KRAS mutant–driven lung cancer model (KRAS G12D model)
and monitored pS6K(T389), pAkt(T308), and p4EBP1(T37/46)
by immunohistochemistry. As expected, Torin2 strongly suppressed pS6K(T389) and p4EBP1(T37/46) and partly suppressed pAkt(T308). Treatment of mice with AZD6244 at 25
mg/kg resulted in a profound inhibition of pERK (41). Combined administration of Torin2 (40 mg/kg) and AZD6244 (25
mg/kg) showed strong inhibition of all pharmacodynamics
markers. Having established the ability to inhibit the intended
targets, we evaluated tumor size by MRI and pharmacodynamic markers after 4 weeks of treatment. Treatment with
neither Torin2 (40 mg/kg, every day) nor AZD6244 (25 mg/kg,
every day) alone resulted in a signiﬁcant inhibition of tumor
volume as determined by MRI. In contrast, the combination of
2 drugs showed signiﬁcant reduction in tumor growth (P <
0.0001; Fig. 5A and B). Moreover, PET-CT showed a clear
metabolic rate reduction in tumors treated with both compounds but not those treated with either compound alone
(Supplementary Figs. S3 and S4). Examination of pharmacodynamic markers following 4-week treatment revealed some
recovery of mTOR and MEK activity. In the Torin2 treatment
group, pS6K(T389) and p4EBP1(T37/46) levels showed some
recovery (Fig. 5C and D), whereas pERK1/2 levels was significantly increased. In the AZD6244 treatment group, the
pERK1/2 levels had slightly recovered. In addition, The
pCHK1(S345) of Torin2 group was slightly decreased indicating a inhibition of ATR kinase.

Discussion
We have described Torin2 as a potent orally bioavailable
mTOR kinase inhibitor with signiﬁcant selectivity over other
protein kinases. In cells, Torin2 showed more than 800-fold
selectivity against PI3K, approximately 100-fold selectivity
against ATR and ATM and 500-fold selectivity against DNAPK. Like other mTOR active site inhibitors, Torin2 causes rapid
dephosphorylation of rapamycin-sensitive mTORC1 substrates, such as S6K (T389), rapamycin-insensitive mTORC1
substrates, such as 4EBP1(T37/46), and mTORC2 substrates
such as Akt(S473). Consistent with these effects, Torin2 is a
potent inducer of phenotypes associated with mTOR inhibition, such as autophagy and, at higher concentrations,
apoptosis.
Similarly to other mTOR inhibitors, including rapamycin,
Torin2 also exhibited a bimodal effect on Akt activity. Acute

Liu et al.

inhibition of Akt S473 phosphorylation reduces recruitment to
the plasma membrane where PDK1 phosphorylates T308, a site
in the activation loop that directly regulates Akt kinase activity.
However, prolonged inhibition of mTORC1 de-represses a
feedback loop that ultimately leads to PI3K hyperactivation
(11). In this context, Akt is recruited to the plasma membrane
despite dephosphorylation at S473, and Akt phosphorylation at
T308 and kinase activity is reactivated to near normal levels.
These effects are likely to be directly mediated through dual
inhibition of mTORC1 and mTORC2 as the highly selective
ATP-competitive mTOR inhibitor AZD8055 has been reported
to exhibit the same bimodal effect on Akt activity (42). Nonetheless, the absence of phosphorylation at S473 is thought to
limit levels of Akt activity below a threshold required for
tumorigenesis (43). Thus, mTOR active site inhibitors may
permit Akt activity within physiologic bounds while preventing
the level of hyperactivation often observed with rapamycin and
related rapalogs.
Torin2 retains the slow off-rate kinetics that we previously
observed with Torin1, but not with other mTOR inhibitors.
This long residence is potentially desirable because it results it
sustained pharmacodynamics, which seem to compensate for
the relatively short half-lives of Torin1 and Torin2 in vivo
(13, 29). The recovery rate for Torin2 is, however, faster than
for Torin1. Torin1 suppressed S6K T389 phosphorylation for up
to 16 hours after removal of the drug, whereas Torin2 maintained suppression for only 4 hours (40). The difference was
somewhat surprising given that Torin2 is a structural analog of
Torin1, and molecular modeling indicates that both compounds use the same binding mode (13, 29). Moreover, both
Torin1 and Torin2 show similar EC50s for mTOR substrates in
cells, indicating that the difference in recovery times cannot be
explained simply by different afﬁnities for the binding pocket.
One possible explanation is that Torin1 induces a conformational change in the kinase that is energetically more difﬁcult
to recover from.
There currently exists signiﬁcant interest in the use of mTOR
inhibitors as anticancer therapeutics, as evidenced by efforts
from Wyeth, OSI, and Intellikine, etc. Like other mTOR inhibitors, Torin2 had broad efﬁcacy against a panel of cancer cell
lines although we were unable to associate any particular
genetic alteration with resistance or sensitivity. Indeed, we
identiﬁed only 1 cell line (Calu-1) that was markedly resistant.
In general, cell lines harboring mutations in KRAS were more
resistant to the effect of mTOR inhibition on proliferation,
consistent with previous reports (44). However, cell lines with
KRAS mutations exhibit a broad range of responses to mTOR
inhibitors, and therefore a single lesion is unlikely to determine
sensitivity. Analysis of a more comprehensive panel of tumor
cell lines may better clarify the spectrum of alterations that
determine sensitivity to the effects of mTOR inhibition.
We also asked whether Torin2 might synergize with other
anticancer treatments. Unlike Torin1, Torin2 at slightly higher
concentrations also targets the PIKK kinases ATM, ATR, and
DNA-PK, which is similar with PI3K/mTOR dual inhibitor
BEZ235 (45). Each of these kinases plays important roles in
the response to DNA damage. BEZ235 has been shown to
sensitize the chemotherapy treatment such as cisplatin due to

2584

the inhibition of ATR, and here we showed that torin2 can
sensitization of the ionizing radiation treatment in human
ﬁbroblast cells. In addition, we detected no synergy between
Torin2 and these treatments (data not shown). One explanation may be that the cell-cycle arrest caused by mTOR inhibition protects cells from DNA damaging agents, which tend to
act during S-phase. However, tumor cell lines that maintain
proliferation when treated with Torin2 alone, such as Calu-1,
may be more susceptible to combined treatment with DNAdamaging agents and deserve further investigation.
Previous work has indicated that molecules targeting the
Ras/MAPK pathway might also synergize with mTOR inhibition (46). Various combinations of inhibitors have been
reported to achieve better efﬁcacy in a range of cancer models
(46, 47) and some of these regimens are currently in clinical
trials for treatment of solid tumors such as PF04691502(PI3K/
mTOR)/PD-0325901(MEK) from Pﬁzer and GSK2126458(PI3K/
mTOR)/GSK1120212(MEK) (48) from GSK. Here, we tested the
efﬁcacy of Torin2 either alone or in combination with the MEK
inhibitor AZD6244 against a mouse model of lung cancer
driven by expression of KRASG12D-mutant allele. Despite
efﬁcacy against cell lines harboring similar mutations in
culture, neither Torin2 nor AZD6244 alone showed apparent
antitumor activity in this model as single agents. Short-term
treatment with either compound reduced target phosphorylation, such as pS6K(T389) for Torin2 and pErk1/2 for AZD6244
as determined by immunohistochemistry. However, a longer 4week treatment resulted in partial reactivation of the targeted
pathways. In tumors treated with Torin2, immunohistochemistry revealed increased levels of both pAkt(T308) and pS6K
(T389) relative to short-term treatment. Likewise, tumors
treated with AZD6244 exhibited partially recovered levels of
pERK. Both observations of pathway reactivation are consistent with previous reports and further the paradoxical but
increasingly common theme that prolonged inhibition of
individual signaling pathways leads to compensatory activation through secondary mechanisms.
In contrast to their single-agent efﬁcacy, 4-week treatment
of tumors with a combination of Torin2 and AZD6244 significantly reduced tumor volume. Moreover, this regimen prevented the reactivation of each pathway as observed when each
inhibitor was used alone. Why this occurs is unclear, as the
currently understood mechanisms for mTOR reactivation do
not involve the Ras/MAPK pathway, and vice versa. Thus, MEK
and mTOR may play complementary and unappreciated roles
in the reactivation of the other's signaling pathways. Nonetheless, the maintenance of pathway suppression is likely an
important contributor to the antitumor efﬁcacy of dual-inhibitor regimen. The dual mTOR/PI3K inhibitor BEZ235 also
synergized with AZD6244 in the same lung cancer model
(46). As Torin2 does not signiﬁcantly impair PI3K activity, our
results indicate that the mTOR-speciﬁc activity of BEZ235 is
key to its efﬁcacy in this model.
We have described Torin2 as a potent pan-PIKK kinase
inhibitor with signiﬁcant activity and selectivity against mTOR,
ATM, ATR, and DNA-PK and both in vitro and in vivo antitumor
efﬁcacy. As described previously for the dual mTOR/PI3K
inhibitor BEZ235, Torin2 potently synergized with the MEK

PIKK Inhibitor Torin2 with Antitumor Activity

inhibitor AZD6244 in a KRAS-driven model of lung cancer. The
efﬁcacy of Torin2 in this particular model is likely due mTOR
inhibition. However, the capacity of Torin2 to target other
PIKK kinases may prove useful in other contexts where mTOR
inhibition alone is ineffective, potentially in combination DNAdamaging therapies.
