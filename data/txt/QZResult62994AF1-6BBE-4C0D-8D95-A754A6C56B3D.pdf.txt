BACKGROUND: Little is known about the impact of direct-to-consumer advertising (DTCA) on appropriate versus inappropriate
prescribing. Aromatase inhibitor (AI) therapy for breast cancer provides an ideal paradigm for studying this issue, because AIs have
been the focus of substantial DTCA, and because they should only be used in postmenopausal women, age can serve as a simple
surrogate marker of appropriateness. METHODS: Data regarding national DTCA spending for the AIs were obtained from TNS
Multimedia; hormonal therapy prescription data were obtained from IMS Health. Time series analyses were performed to characterize
the association between monthly changes in DTCA spending for the AIs and monthly changes in the proportion of all new hormonal
therapy prescriptions represented by the AIs from October 2005 to September 2007. Analyses were stratified by age, considering
prescriptions for women  40 (likely premenopausal) to be inappropriate and those for women > 60 (likely postmenopausal) to be
appropriate. RESULTS: Monthly dollars spent on AI-associated DTCA varied considerably ($118,600 to $22,019,660). Time series
analysis revealed that for every million dollars spent on DTCA for the AIs, there was an associated increase 3 months later in the new
AI prescription proportion of 0.15% for all ages (P < .0001) and 0.18% for those > 60 years (P < .0001), but no significant change for
those  40 at any time from 0 to 6 months. CONCLUSIONS: DTCA for the AIs was associated with increases in appropriate prescriptions with no significant effect on inappropriate prescriptions, suggesting that DTCA may not foster inappropriate medication use for

INTRODUCTION
It seems evident that direct-to-consumer advertising (DTCA), which is the marketing of medications or medical services
directly to consumers through promotion in the lay media,1 must increase prescriptions, otherwise the marketing departments of pharmaceutical companies would not engage in this expensive practice. Indeed, the literature largely demonstrates that DTCA increases demand.2-7 For example, a Kaiser Family Foundation study found that for every 10%
increase in DTCA, there is a 1% increase in prescription drug spending.8 On the other hand, it is unclear whether this
increase is ultimately beneficial or harmful to patients. If DTCA causes previously undiagnosed, untreated, or improperly
treated patients to receive appropriate care, it is a valuable mode of health communication; if DTCA results in superfluous
or harmful new prescriptions, it is not.
Although determining the relative effect of DTCA on appropriate and inappropriate prescribing is the most critical
research question relating to DTCA, it remains largely unanswered. This is because it is exceedingly difficult to define
appropriate and inappropriate use in an easily measurable way for most medications advertised in this manner. For example, whereas one study found that higher levels of exposure to DTCA for HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors was significantly
associated with improvements in the likelihood of attaining cholesterol management goals for some patients (appropriate
use), the investigators were unable to define an inappropriate use.2 Indeed, such categorization would generally require
detailed data on the recipients of prescriptions, which would be very expensive to generate for a large sample.
In contrast, we identified a paradigm in cancer medicine that permits characterization of DTCA-associated appropriate and inappropriate uses of medication at the population level. The aromatase inhibitors (AIs) are a class of oral breast
cancer therapies that reduce the risk of cancer recurrence in postmenopausual women (appropriate use) but not in premenopausal women (inappropriate use), because they do not effectively suppress ovarian estrogen production.9-13 Because
age is a strong proxy for menopausal status,14-17 simply by knowing the age of a woman with breast cancer who has
received a prescription for an AI, we are able to classify with a reasonable level of certainty whether her treatment was

appropriate. It is important to note that unlike prior studies that have assessed the potential impact of DTCA on
whether to give any treatment, our paradigm focuses on
how DTCA may affect the choice of one treatment over
another for patients who are definitely going to be treated.
Fortuitously, 2 of the AIs (letrozole and anastrozole) have
been marketed aggressively with DTCA. In addition, the
only alternative therapy to AIs (tamoxifen) is appropriate
for premenopausal women, was the standard for both preand postmenopausal women before the AIs, and had not
been advertised with DTCA for many years before the AIs
became available.
We aimed to determine if increases in dollars spent
on DTCA for the AIs are associated with increases in new
prescriptions for the AIs. We were particularly interested
in comparing appropriate and inappropriate use. We
hypothesized that there would be a significant increase in
AI use associated with DTCA in all age groups, both for
older women for whom this treatment is appropriate, as
well as for younger, presumably premenopausal women
for whom such treatment is inappropriate. Importantly,
our second hypothesis assumes that premenopausal
patients who see AI DTCA will sometimes ask for the
medications, even if the advertisments specifiy that the
medications are not appropriate for them, and also that
their providers will sometimes mistakenly prescribe them.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
AI Advertising Content Analysis

To put our main analysis in context, we performed a brief
content analysis focusing on magazine advertisements for
the AIs that were in circulation during the study period.
Our methods have been described previously18; briefly,
we reviewed all unique DTCA for the AIs appearing in 3
patient-focused cancer magazines and a sample of selected
popular magazines in 2005 and 2006. We determined the
Flesch reading ease score (FRES) for the text in each advertisement (a score > or ¼ 65 is readable for the average
person). We also assessed the size of text devoted to benefits versus risks/adverse effects, as well as the content of
advertising appeals. Finally, we assessed whether the
advertisements stated that the AIs were for adjuvant breast
cancer treatment and whether they are only for use in
postmenopausal women.
Data Sources for the Main Analysis

We obtained data regarding dollars spent for DTCA for
the AIs from TNS Media Intelligence Incorporated’s
‘‘StrADegy’’TM database. The database records consumerdirected advertising (television, newspaper, radio,
1066

magazines, and Internet) appearing nationally and in the
largest 101 United States media markets. This data source
has been used extensively in prior research on
DTCA.2,3,5,19-21 The marketing data contained information on the medium and venue of the advertising for each
product, as well as dollars spent advertising the product at
both the national and local level based on DTCA volume
for that month. We used total dollars in advertising
spending in all national venues by month summed across
the 3 brands of AIs (anastrozole, letrozole, and exemestane) from July 2005 to June 2007 as our independent
variable. We chose to analyze advertising for all of the AIs
together rather than the individual brands separately,
because prior data has shown that DTCA for one medication in a class may be associated with increases in prescriptions for all members.7,19,22 We also queried the
StrADegy database for DTCA for tamoxifen, finding
none during the study period.
Data regarding monthly prescriptions for the AIs
and tamoxifen were obtained from IMS Health Incorporated, through their NPA Market DynamicsTM, a subset
of their National Prescription AuditTM database. We
chose the time period October 2005 to September 2007,
because it was many months after guidelines for adjuvant
AI use had been published (January 2005)13 and close to
the dates of US Food and Drug Administration approval
of adjuvant use for all 3 agents (anastrozole: September
2005; exemestane: October 2005; letrozole: December
2005). The NPA database, which has been used less frequently in DTCA research23 but more extensively in other
medication-related health services research,24-26 measures
prescriptions for pharmaceutical products dispensed from
retail pharmacies in the United States (27,000 pharmacies
at the time of the analysis). During the period of our analysis, it included more than 150 million unique de-identified patients, each of whose information was encrypted
and tracked longitudinally to account for patient travel or
address change. The database captured approximately
50% of all prescriptions nationally and then used a proprietary method to estimate nationwide volume. It was
updated weekly, maintained a 36-month rolling history,
and captured more than 1 million providers. Notably, at
the time of this analysis, the database did not include prescriptions from mail service pharmacies or long-term care
facilities.
For our analysis, we defined ‘‘new prescription’’ as
either a prescription that was completely new to a patient
or a new prescription for a patient who had received that
medication before, because we reasoned that in both cases,
a clinician had to make a decision to write or rewrite a
Cancer

prescription that could have been influenced by DTCA.
We excluded routine refills, because these did not require
clinician decision-making. In addition to type of prescription, the database included information on the age and
sex of the patient, and state where the prescription was dispensed (we collapsed these into Northeast, Midwest,
South, and West regions). It also provided the specialty of
the provider who wrote the prescription, determined
through an algorithm that includes data from the American Medical Association, the American Osteopathic Association, and the National Provider Index (updated
monthly). Notably, all of our analyses were restricted to
women, and we focused only on prescriptions written by
hematologists or oncologists in order to exclude the
uncommon use of the AIs for benign conditions (eg,
infertility).
Finally, to create a measure of physician-directed
marketing over the study time period, we reviewed all the
issues of The Journal of Clinical Oncology, a high-impact
journal with advertising that is read widely by oncology
clinicians, from October 2005 to July 2007. We counted
the size, position, and number of advertisements for the 3
AIs each month and multiplied them by the journal’s
commercial advertising rates to generate an aggregate
monthly amount of dollars spent. Although this amount
likely represents only a fraction of what was actually spent
on physician-directed marketing for the AIs each month,
we reasoned that month-to-month changes would likely
reflect changes in overall spending on physician-directed
marketing for the AIs.
Statistical Methods

We performed a time series analysis,27 comparing
monthly dollars spent on DTCA for the AIs with monthly
changes in the ‘‘new AI prescription proportion,’’
defined as:
ðNew

Rx0 s

ðNew Rx0 s for AIsÞ
for AIs þ New Rx0 s for tamoxifenÞ

The data from IMS Health provided aggregate categories
of prescriptions over time. We chose the above proportion as our primary outcome variable because it allowed
us to assess the association of DTCA with changes in AI
prescriptions while taking into account any temporal
changes in overall use of hormonal therapy for breast
cancer (represented by the denominator). It is important
to note, however, that the denominator of our measure
does not capture the population of all patients who may
be candidates for a prescription for hormonal breast

cancer therapy, but rather all prescriptions received by
patients who did in fact receive a prescription for one of
the types of hormonal therapy.
We fit time series models to test whether a statistically significant change occurred in new AI prescription
proportion associated with changes in monthly DTCA
spending for AIs. We made no assumptions about the
likely lag between the exposure and the outcome;
instead, we used the time series analysis to determine
the interval at which the maximum effect potentially
occurred. We modeled the relationship between the cost
of DTCA and the proportion of new AI prescriptions
over the 2-year study period in 3 groups: 1) women of
all ages; 2) women aged 40 years or less (a conservative
age estimate of premenopausal status); and 3) women
over 60 (a conservative age estimate of postmenopausal
status). We did not separately analyze the group of 41to 60-year-olds, because the appropriateness of AI use
in this group is less certain.
The first step was to ensure that the dollars spent on
DTCA for the AIs and proportion of new AI prescriptions
were stationary over time using the Box-Jenkins
approach.28 Autocorrelation plots of the monthly changes
in new AI prescription proportion were examined to
determine appropriate autoregressive moving average
models in the 3 age strata. Autocorrelation and partial
autocorrelation plots identified a first-order autoregressive, or AR(1), dependence structure in the dollars spent
monthly on DTCA for the AIs. In the second step, crosscorrelation functions (CCF) were used to identify how
many months a potential change in proportion of new AI
prescriptions may have occurred after DTCA, using
standard selection criteria.29,30 A final transfer function
model was fit to estimate the effect of DTCA on the proportion of new AI prescriptions, incorporating the preliminary results of the autoregressive moving average
structures and lag values.31 Model diagnostics checking
autocorrelation and cross correlation of residuals were
used to assess the fit of all 3 models. Finally, an independent series of linear regression models including AI prescription proportion at different time lags after DTCA
was fit to confirm the lag values suggested by the time
series analysis.
To assess the possibility that physician-directed marketing for AIs could be influencing the new AI prescription proportion, an analogous time series approach was
used to model the relationship between that proportion
and monthly cost of AI advertising in the Journal of Clinical Oncology over the 2-year period. We then fit stratified

linear regression models for the different age groups
including both dollars spent on DTCA as well as dollars
spent on Journal of Clinical Oncology advertising to determine if the effects on the new AI prescription proportion
of one could be accounted for by the other. All analyses
were carried out using SAS, version 9.1 (SAS Institute,
Cary, NC). Our analysis was submitted to the DanaFarber Office for Human Research Studies, which determined it was exempt from review.
RESULTS
We found 4 unique print advertisements for our content
analysis, 2 for anastrozole, and 2 for letrozole (there were
none for exemestane). Both products had appeared in cancer-related patient magazines such as Cure as well as popular magazines such as Good Housekeeping. On average,
slightly more text was devoted to benefits versus risk/
adverse effects (mean ratio ¼ 0.9), and all text was difficult to read (overall mean FRES below 40). Appeals using
clinical trial data were made in all 4, and all specifically
stated that patients must be postmenopausal to take an
AI. Finally, only 3 mentioned that the product was for use
in the ‘‘adjuvant’’ setting, but the remaining advertisement did state that it is used to prevent cancer recurrence.

Table 1 summarizes the characteristics of the prescription data used in our main analysis: new prescriptions
for the AIs plus tamoxifen, new prescriptions for the AIs
alone, and the new AI prescription proportion for the
entire study period (October 2005 to September 2007).
The total national market for new hormonal therapy prescriptions (new AIs plus new tamoxifen) written by hematologists and oncologists remained stable (approximately
180,000 per quarter). In contrast, the proportion of that
market made up by new prescriptions for the AIs
increased from approximately 61% to 68%.
The most common venues of DTCA for AIs were
national magazines and magazines included in Sunday
papers. For example, in the month with the highest spending on DTCA, 79.0% was spent on national magazines
and 20.8% on Sunday magazines. There was also considerable variation in monthly DTCA expenditures for the
AIs over time, with a high of $22,019,660 in October of
2005 and a low of $118,600 in January of 2007 (Fig. 1).
Time series analysis demonstrated that for every
million dollars spent on DTCA for the AIs during the
study time period, there was an associated increase in the
overall new AI prescription proportion of 0.15% after 3
months, a time period determined by the analysis itself.

In analyses stratified by age, there was an associated
increase of 0.18% for those over age 60, also after 3
months (representing approximately 118 new AI prescriptions per million dollars spent), but no significant change
associated with DTCA spending for AIs for those aged
40 years or less at any time from 0 to 6 months (Table 2).
Importantly, power analysis demonstrated that, with an
alpha of .05, there was 91% power to detect a similar difference of 0.18% in the monthly new AI proportion in
this younger age group, had it existed.
In linear regression models taking into account possible lags from 0 to 4 months, the only time periods that
were significant were a positive association at 3 months
for all ages (0.14% increase in new AI prescription proportion; P ¼ .0015) and at 3 months for age greater than

tion; P ¼ .0015). As in the time series analysis, DTCA for
AIs was not associated with new AI prescription proportion for those aged 40 years or less for any time period.
Notably, we found similar results when limiting the analysis to the period after January 2006 (excluding the large
spike in DTCA seen in October of 2005).
The second time series analysis examining the association between calculated Journal of Clinical Oncology
advertising dollars and new AI prescription proportion
revealed a significant decrease in new AI prescription proportion at a time lag of 0 months for those aged 40 years
or less (2.1%, P ¼ .039), with no significant effect among
those over 60 or for all ages combined. Finally, the results
of linear regression models that included both DTCA for
the AIs and Journal of Clinical Oncology advertising for the
AIs are shown in Table 3. In this combined model, we
found no significant effect of either type of advertising on
the new AI prescription proportion for those aged 40
years or less (although there was a trend toward a decrease
associated with Journal of Clinical Oncology advertising, P
¼ .07). In contrast, for those over 60 years of age, DTCA
for AIs had a significant positive effect (increase of new AI
prescription proportion of 0.12% for each million dollars;
P < .0001) but Journal of Clinical Oncology advertising of
AIs had no significant effect (P ¼ .45).
DISCUSSION
We expected to find that DTCA for the AIs increased
both appropriate and inappropriate prescriptions.
Instead, we found that increases in DTCA for the AIs
prompted prescriptions only in the patient population for

whom they were appropriate. Two mechanisms might
account for this finding. It is possible that the advertisements, which our content analysis revealed include statements about the need to be postmenopausal to receive AI
treatment, were perfectly successful targeted marketing,
defined as ‘‘marketing products/services for a specific segment rather than the whole market.’’32 More likely, the
required participation of physicians in the pathway
between a patient seeing an advertisement and actually
receiving a prescription functioned to selectively block the
effect of advertising-induced interest in these agents
among patients for whom they would be medically
inappropriate.
Much of our analysis hinges on our definitions of
appropriate and inappropriate. Indeed, it may be more
reasonable to consider AIs for those over 60 years of age as
‘‘not inappropriate’’ rather than ‘‘appropriate.’’ This is
because despite the recommendation, just before our
study period, of the 2005 American Society of Clinical
Oncology guidelines that ‘‘optimal adjuvant hormonal
therapy for a postmenopausal woman with receptor-positive breast cancer includes an aromatase inhibitor,’’13
some clinicians consider tamoxifen alone to be a reasonable alternative in that age group as well.13,33 In contrast,
although there are other potentially inappropriate uses
(eg, prescribing AIs to women whose cancer is not hormone receptor–positive), our ‘‘inappropriate’’ definition
of AIs for those aged 40 years or less is robust, because prescribing AIs to women who are likely still premenopausal
may not only fail to prevent breast cancer recurrence but
1070

may actually increase ovarian production of cancer-driving hormones such as estradiol.34
Most prior attempts at characterizing inappropriate
use driven by DTCA have not focused on the possibility of a
high-morbidity outcome such as cancer recurrence, but on
less devastating effects such as obtaining unnecessary screening tests35 or prescribing an expensive medication when
there is a cheaper alternative.36 One exception is a landmark
randomized trial that assessed the effects of DTCA on clinicians’ approach to severe depression, manipulating the
reported symptoms and DTCA-related medication
requests of patient-actors. The study found that DTCA
promoted appropriate use of antidepressants when they
were clinically necessary, but also promoted inappropriate
use of antidepressants when they were not.4 In contrast, we
found that DTCA promoted appropriate use of the AIs but
did not have an effect on inappropriate use. The difference
in our findings may be due to our methods (populationbased analysis versus randomized trial) or due to the type of
medication we studied, because DTCA effects may be governed by separate principles given the nature of oncologic
illness.37,38 Indeed, it is important to emphasize that our
results may not be generalizable to all DTCA, because the
AIs are specialized medications most often prescribed by
providers with high levels of expertise in their use.
Although we found no association of DTCA with
inappropriate prescribing, there may be other negative
effects of cancer-related DTCA that were not captured in
our study. For example, some of the cost to fund DTCA
may be passed on to patients who receive drugs marketed
in this manner, and DTCA may also have a negative
impact on the physician-patient relationship, such as
reducing patients’ confidence in their clinician.39,40 For the
AIs specifically, DTCA may also negatively impact the
time management of clinicians who have to explain to premenopausal patients that they are not candidates for AI
therapy. On the other hand, DTCA may also have positive
effects in addition to the increased demand for appropriate
medication use that we found, such as increases in high-priority diagnoses,41 fostering medication compliance,20 and
encouraging patients to communicate with their physicians.42 Such ancillary risks and benefits of DTCA are not
well-characterized and merit further study.
Although we could have found an effect of decreased
inappropriate prescribing due to increased patient awareness of AI prescribing indications, we did not. Clearly,
our content analysis demonstrated that DTCA for the AIs
did an adequate job of presenting indications for
treatment. It is interesting that neither DTCA nor physician-targeted advertising decreased the proportion of
Cancer

inappropriate prescriptions, even though the level of
patient and physician knowledge about appropriate prescribing should have increased. This may be due to lack of
patient awareness of AI DTCA; however, our prior survey
of breast cancer patients as to their DTCA awareness suggests that this is not the case (86.2% reported being
aware).39
Our analysis has limitations. First, our outcome
measure, namely, new AI prescription proportion, does
not truly characterize prescription use, because all patients
represented by its denominator necessarily received prescriptions. Thus, we are not able to shed any light on the
potential influence of DTCA on clinical decisions regarding whether to give an AI prescription or in which context
(eg, with or without chemotherapy, or for chemoprevention), just on which type of hormonal therapy prescription was given to those patients who received one.
Second, our prescription data excluded mail service pharmacies and long-term care facilities, and contained no information on breast cancer status or outcomes such as
recurrence of disease, survival, or the quality of physicianpatient discussions. Indeed, if a large number of patients
who were prescribed these agents by hematologists and
oncologists did not have breast cancer, our conclusions
about the effects of AI patient-directed advertising (which
was for adjuvant breast cancer use) would be different.
Third, although we attempted to account for other types
of AI marketing with our inclusion of advertisements in
the Journal of Clinical Oncology, this is admittedly only
one source of physician-directed journal advertising, and
it is also still possible that DTCA may be a marker for
other types of marketing such as physician detailing.
Finally, the US Food and Drug Administration approval of all 3 AIs for adjuvant use close to the start of our
study period was associated with a spike in DTCA, and
this approval, rather than the spike in DTCA, may have
been partially responsible for some of the pattern of
increased AI use observed. On the other hand, consensus
guidelines for the use of the AIs in adjuvant breast cancer
were in place well before they were specifically approved
for such use, and there is evidence that, at least at academic
centers, patients were receiving them as initial adjuvant
therapy several years before our study period.43 More
importantly, our results did not change appreciably with
the spike removed.
In conclusion, spending on DTCA for the AIs was
associated with an increase in appropriate prescriptions,
with no significant effect on inappropriate prescriptions.
Our data thus suggest that this controversial form of medical communication may not be harmful for certain classes
Cancer

of drugs such as cancer medicines. Indeed, in some situations, such as when an appropriate use is the only option,
DTCA may actually be beneficial. It is interesting to note,
however, that in cases where there is only one appropriate
treatment for a condition, DTCA is unlikely to be widespread. The converse is certainly true. For example, a
recent study found that the medications most highly
advertised directly to patients were for insomnia, gastrointestinal reflux disease, and hypercholesterolemia.22 For all
of these conditions, there are many appropriate treatment
options, so even if no inappropriate prescribing resulted
from their associated DTCA, the ultimate benefit of such
marketing for patients and society remains unclear.
