Summary

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Brain metastasis is an end stage in breast cancer progression. Traditional treatment options have
minimal efficacy, and overall survival is on the order of months. The incidence of brain metastatic
disease is increasing with the improved management of systemic disease and prolongation of
survival. Unfortunately, the targeted therapies that control systemic disease have diminished
efficacy against brain lesions. There are reasons to be optimistic, however, as emerging therapies
have shown promise in preclinical and early clinical settings. This review discusses recent
advances in breast cancer brain metastasis therapy and potential approaches for successful
treatment.

Breast cancer brain metastases are an increasing health care problem

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

The incidence of breast cancer brain metastases (BCBM) varies with the subtype of disease.
Whereas patients with estrogen receptor (ER) positive, human epidermal growth factor
receptor-2 (HER-2) negative tumors (70% of breast cancers) have a brain metastasis
incidence of 5–10%, those with triple-negative or HER2-positive tumors have an incidence
rate about 20% and 25–50%, respectively (Kennecke et al., 2010; Aversa et al. 2014). The
high incidence rate for patients with HER2-positive disease is likely due to several factors,
including the ability of HER2 to increase the proclivity of brain metastases (BM), but is
almost certainly due to the prolongation of survival resulting from anti-HER2 targeted
therapies (Brufsky et al., 2011b; Gori et al., 2007; Olson et al., 2013). As therapies for
systemic disease improve, incidence rates of BCBM are likely to rise. In the majority of
cases, treatment is palliative and mostly local, such as surgical resection, stereotactic

radiosurgery and/or whole brain irradiation (WBRT) (Eichler et al, 2011). Prognosis is
affected by various factors, including the number of BM, the presence of active extracranial
disease, the patient’s age and performance status, and the tumor subtype (Sperduto et al.,
2013; Sperduto et al., 2012). These factors also affect treatment regimens. Survival duration
varies between 4–6 months with WBRT to about 18 months with multimodal therapies
(Kocher et al., 2011). The poor prognosis with local therapies, and the fact that most patients
with BCBM display synchronous extracranial disease, underscores the need for better
systemic treatments with efficacy in the cerebral microenvironment. Over the last few years,
preclinical and clinical progress in the treatment of BCBM has led to novel hypotheses for
improving therapeutic outcome. This review focuses on these discoveries, separates those
confirmed in patients from those still pre-clinical, distinguishes between preventative and
treatment strategies, and suggests avenues for future investigation.

Can breast cancer brain metastases be prevented?

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Animal models of BM have provided insights into processes of the brain-metastatic cascade:
dissemination of metastasis-competent cells from the primary tumor, intravasation into the
blood circulation, active or passive migration towards the target organ, embedding into a
capillary bed and attachment to the endothelium, extravasation through the blood-brain
barrier (BBB), and expansion in the brain microenvironment (Figure 1) (Eichler et al.,
2011). Once arrested within the capillary bed of the brain circulation, metastatic cancer cells
come in contact with brain microvascular endothelial cells, which promote cancer cell
growth and invasion. Real-time imaging of a murine brain metastasis model showed early
extravasation and persistent contact with microvessels as necessary elements for
colonization (Kienast et al., 2010). A separate study identified the cell adhesion molecule L1
(L1CAM) as necessary for vascular co-option and, therefore, metastatic cancer cell survival
and tumor initiation in the brain microenvironment (Valiente et al., 2014).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

The majority of preclinical studies focus on early stages of BCBM. This is mainly due to the
fact that the knowledge gained from preclinical studies is limited to the models and
treatment methods employed. While models of spontaneous brain metastasis from intramammary implanted breast cancer cells exist, the majority of knowledge has been gained
from intracardiac, intracarotid, or intracranial injection models that forgo invasion and
migratory escape from the primary tumor environs. Multiple selection rounds of brain
metastatic lesions after mammary fat pad, intracarotid, or intracardiac injection have
generated “brain-seeking” clonal sublines. Gene expression analysis between brain-seeking
and parental lines identified genes involved in the early stages of the BCBM cascade. In
addition, the majority of studies involve treatments initiated before the establishment of
BCBM. Analysis of the initial steps of brain metastatic colonization revealed that
intravascularly injected cancer cells colonize the brain beginning at day 7–10 post injection
(Kienast et al., 2010; Lorger and Felding-Habermann, 2010). Treatment studies that begin
prior to colonization translate, clinically, into prevention studies. Table 1 summarizes salient
findings from preclinical prevention studies for each of the specific process of the brain
metastatic cascade (Figure 1). If preventative measures are to succeed in the clinic, methods
to identify predisposed patients are necessary, and this will entail identification of the
expression of relevant proteins in primary or systemic metastases of patient tissue (Table 1).

In addition to biopsy or resected tissue, circulating tumor cells (CTCs) have important
prognostic and therapeutic implications in the prevention setting. Zhang, et al. (Zhang et al.,
2013) identified a potential signature of BCBM in human CTCs that has the potential to
identify patients susceptible to brain metastatic disease.

Studies investigating the biology of established metastatic lesions and its interaction with the
microenvironment are beginning to provide important knowledge about brain colonization.
Once infiltrated into the brain tissue, breast cancer cells encounter a number of host cell
types, including pericytes, reactive glia, neural progenitor cells, neurons, and
oligodendrocytes. Although the survival of neurons is reduced by growing BM (Fitzgerald et
al., 2012), there are no studies implicating neurons, oligodendrocytes or pericytes in BM
formation. Pericytes are present in BM (Lorger and Felding-Habermann, 2010), and play a
significant role in the vasculature of primary brain tumors (Armulik et al., 2011; Cheng et
al., 2013). More is known about the role of astrocytes and microglia that surround and
infiltrate brain metastatic lesions (Fitzgerald et al., 2008; Lorger and Felding-Habermann,
2010). Analysis of human BCBM shows an abundance of activated astrocytes and microglia
around and within the lesion (Zhang and Olsson, 1995). The initial survival of brain
metastatic cells seems to depend on their ability to evade astrocyte-induced cell death
(Valiente et al., 2014). The cells that survive take advantage of the growth-permissive
microenvironment. Preclinical studies have begun to unravel the effect of the brain
microenvironment on cancer cells, including its ability to reprogram the gene expression
patterns of different cancer cell types (Park et al., 2011). Gene signature analysis revealed
alterations in pathways such as proliferation, cell death and metabolism in breast cancer
cells. Astrocytes, alone, can alter the gene expression of breast or lung cancer cells, and can
promote resistance to chemotherapy through activation of the endothelin axis (Kim et al.,
2011; Kim et al., 2014). Recent findings demonstrate that tumor cells can increase the
density of growth-permissive astrocytes by promoting the differentiation of neural
progenitor cells into astrocytes (Neman et al., 2013). Although the outcome of microglia
infiltration is less known, microglia activation is inversely correlated with the growth of
breast cancer cells in the brain (Louie et al., 2013). In summary, the brain microenvironment
clearly offers a unique milieu in which metastatic cancer cells can survive and proliferate.
Pathways altered by the microenvironment that mediate therapeutic resistance are beginning
to emerge. Furthermore, clinical BM tissue has been shown to contain carcinoma-associated
fibroblasts – not resident to the brain – that could play a significant role in colonization and
treatment resistance (Duda et al., 2010).
Despite major preclinical advances, the clinical role of prophylactic approaches for BCBM
is poorly investigated, and clinical features alone may not identify high-risk patients for BM
to justify the toxicity associated with prophylactic therapies. The identification of tissuebased risk signatures could help overcome this. Prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI) slowed
disease progression resulting in survival benefit in small-cell lung cancer (SCLC), providing
the rationale for application in BC. Currently, a randomized phase III trial is investigating
the potential of a prophylactic taxane/trastuzumab treatment alone or in combination with
PCI (Table 2). Published case series and retrospective analyses, however, indicate that PCI
and its benefit-to-risk ratio in BC patients at high risk for BM should be approached
critically (Huang et al., 2009). A phase III trial comparing the EGFR/HER2 kinase inhibitor

lapatinib plus capecitabine versus capecitabine alone in patients with locally advanced or
metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer that were previously treated with taxane-,
anthracycline-or trastuzumab-containing therapies revealed a significant reduction in the
number of cases with CNS involvement as the first site of progression. These results indicate
that the addition of the receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) inhibitor to chemotherapy can
improve the prevention of brain metastases (Cameron et al., 2008). In agreement with the
efficacy of this combination on preventing brain lesions, significant responses were
witnessed in patients with established disease (Bachelot et al., 2013).

BCBM can be diagnosed many years after the initial diagnosis of the disease. This should be
taken into consideration when investigating the role of prophylactic therapies. Recent
studies revealed that single cells or clusters of disseminated breast cancer cells might remain
quiescent for a long time. This latency can be induced by endothelial-derived
thrombospondin-1 suggesting the perivascular niche can regulate breast tumor dormancy
(Ghajar et al., 2013). The dormancy of disseminated breast cancer cells depends on the
histologic subtype (Aversa et al., 2014) and poses a major challenge for prophylactic
strategies, which may cause severe adverse effects. For example, cranial irradiation is
associated with acute, subacute and late/chronic toxicity. In the acute phase radiation
therapy can cause vasogenic edema, resulting in headache, nausea or neurologic deficits.
Subacute encephalopathy may appear up to 6 months post treatment and can progress into
chronic cerebral dysfunction. The latter can be irreversible and cause neurocognitive
deficits, leuko-encephalopathy, cerebral atrophy or even radiation induced necrosis (Dietrich
et al., 2008; Le Pechoux et al., 2011). Markers for neuronal injury can be detected in the
cerebrospinal fluid of patients after PCI, despite the moderate radiation doses used (Kalm et
al., 2014). Similarly, RTKs such as lapatinib can induce significant toxicities, including
cutaneous, gastrointestinal and hematologic side effects, as well as fatigue (Crown et al.,
2013). The long latency for BM makes the determination of the optimal time point for
initiation of PCI or prophylaxis using drugs difficult. This must be taken into account when
designing prophylactic clinical trials.

Is the brain microenvironment the Achilles’ heel of modern therapies?

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

The anti-HER2 antibody trastuzumab, one of the most widely prescribed targeted
therapeutics, is an essential component in the treatment of HER2-positive breast cancer.
Although trastuzumab is effective for systemic disease, its efficacy against BM remains
controversial. Differential sensitivity to trastuzumab between BM and mammary fat pad
tumors is unambiguous (Kodack et al., 2012). Meta-analysis of the phase III adjuvant trials
NSABP B31, NCCTG N9831, HERA and PACS 04 revealed a higher incidence for cerebral
metastasis after adjuvant treatment with trastuzumab (Olson et al., 2013). This is associated
with controlled systemic, extracranial disease (Bendell et al., 2003), supporting the
hypothesis that the enhanced risk for BM after adjuvant trastuzumab treatment is due to
improved systemic control. Clinical evidence for the efficacy of trastuzumab against
established BM is limited, mainly due to the lack of prospective data in this setting.
Retrospective analyses indicate a trend towards improved outcome (Bartsch et al., 2007),
however it remains unclear whether the benefit is due to improved systemic control or drug
efficacy against the cerebral lesions. In either case, the relative risk of the brain as the first

site of relapse is significantly increased in HER2-positive patients treated with trastuzumab
(Olson et al., 2013).

The limited efficacy of trastuzumab against BM is often attributed to an inadequate
penetration through the BBB. Based on its presumed ability to better penetrate the BBB than
trastuzumab, lapatinib, a small molecule kinase inhibitor of EGFR and HER2, was evaluated
in BCBM. Lapatinib exhibited efficacy in a preclinical prevention model of HER2overexpressing BCBM (Gril et al., 2008), leading to prospective clinical trials. In breast
cancer patients with HER2-positive BM that progressed after WBRT, lapatinib showed very
modest activity as a single agent (Lin et al., 2008; Lin et al., 2009). In one study of 39
patients, there was only 1 partial response (2.6%) at 16 weeks after lapatinib initiation;
meanwhile, 4 of 16 patients (25%) with non-CNS disease achieved a partial response, but
were eventually taken off due to CNS progression (Lin et al., 2008). In a separate study,
lapatinib monotherapy showed a response rate of 6% (15 of 237) in a similar subset of
patients (Lin et al., 2009). The success of lapatinib and capecitabine for systemic disease
along with its activity in preventing brain metastasis led to its inclusion in patients with
established BM. Interestingly, the addition of capecitabine to lapatinib increased response
rates to 20% (Lin et al., 2009). Consistent with this data, the combination of lapatinib and
capecitabine, before WBRT, in newly diagnosed BM (LANDSCAPE trial) revealed a CNS
objective response rate of 67% (Bachelot et al., 2013). Further analysis indicated that the
response correlated with a decrease in circulating tumor cells during treatment (Pierga et al.,
2013). The mechanism for the significant efficacy of the combination treatment regimen
remains unclear, but clearly capecitabine is active in this setting. As with trastuzumab, the
question of whether brain metastatic resistance to lapatinib monotherapy is due in part to a
lack of drug penetration remains unresolved, as this parameter has not been thoroughly
investigated in the clinical setting.

Blood-brain barrier: time to rethink its importance in treating BM?

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

The BBB and expression of BBB transporters are thought to diminish the concentration of
systemic therapy available to brain metastatic lesions (Deeken and Loscher, 2007).
However, the blood-tumor barrier (BTB) is leakier than the BBB and permits delivery in
brain lesions especially at later stages of disease (Murrell et al., 2014). The extent of BBB
disruption varies amongst tumor subtypes (Yonemori et al., 2010). Consistent with a
disrupted BBB, significant responses to chemotherapy are reported. Rosner et al. (Rosner et
al., 1986) found a brain specific objective response rate of 50% in 100 breast cancer patients
with symptomatic BM treated with a variety of chemotherapies. These findings were
supported in subsequent studies (Stemmler and Heinemann, 2008), and include activity of
capecitabine monotherapy, which was shown to achieve clinically relevant concentrations in
non-irradiated human BCBM (Morikawa et al., 2013). Despite these reports suggesting a
direct activity of chemotherapy in BM similar to what is observed in extracranial disease,
chemotherapy is generally prescribed secondary to surgery or radiotherapy.
Diminished cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) concentration, compared to plasma levels, was cited
as a mechanism of trastuzumab ineffectiveness due to an inadequate penetration through the
BBB (Stemmler et al., 2007). However, the CSF represents a separate compartment from the

brain parenchyma, separated from the parenteral circulation by the blood-CSF barrier and
from the brain parenchyma by the glia limitans. In support of inadequate trastuzumab
penetration as a reason for its ineffectiveness, increased delivery of trastuzumab via
phosphodiesterase inhibition-induced BBB disruption enhanced its efficacy in a murine
intracranial model (Hu et al., 2010). Consistent with the BTB being leaky, PET-based
clinical studies demonstrated an accumulation of trastuzumab in human BCBM despite its
high molecular weight (Tamura et al., 2013). It remains unclear, however, whether the
concentration of trastuzumab achieved in the BM setting is sufficient to slow tumor growth
(Lampson L.A, 2011). Recent clinical findings describing the efficacy of antibody-based
therapy in BCBM suggest sufficient concentrations are achieved in brain metastatic lesions
– these include bevacizumab (Lin et al., 2013; Lu et al., 2012) and trastuzumab-DM1
[(Bartsch et al., 2014; Krop et al., 2014; Yamamoto et al., 2012), see “Targeting the brain
microenvironment for successful therapy” and “Future approaches”]. As with trastuzumab,
the question of achieving an adequate concentration of lapatinib within the BM lesion
remains unanswered. In preclinical models, lapatinib accumulated in brain lesions at higher
concentrations than the normal brain, but at significantly lower levels than extracranial
disease (Kodack et al., 2012; Taskar et al., 2012). Still, the concentrations achieved were
significantly higher than its IC50 in vitro, and in our study led to significant inhibition of
HER2 phosphorylation and downstream signaling. Human data indicate clinically relevant
lapatinib concentrations are achieved in a number of BCBM, though a significant variation
amongst them exists (Morikawa et al., 2013).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Strategies to enhance the delivery of therapeutics into the CNS have been actively pursued,
and are beginning to undergo clinical evaluation. Radiation is known to disrupt the BBB
(Brown et al., 2005). Hence, the efficacy of trastuzumab, lapatinib, and/or bevacizumab in
combination with radiotherapy is currently being investigated in clinical trials (see Table 2).
Other approaches to physically breakdown the BBB include infusion of a hyperosmotic
agent, focused ultrasound, or treatment with bradykinin analogs (Eichler et al., 2011). One
concern about disruption of the BBB is the potential of allowing circulating cancer cells
more ready access to the brain parenchyma, thus potentially initiating new brain lesions.
Furthermore, chronic BBB breakdown is associated with the accumulation of serum proteins
and peripherally derived neurotoxic macromolecules, ultimately leading to neuronal
degenerative changes (Bell et al., 2010). In addition to BBB disruption, other methods have
been studied to enhance drug movement across the BBB. Taking advantage of the
endogenously expressed BBB receptor low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein
(LRP-1), peptide-chemotherapy conjugates were designed to achieve superior delivery into
preclinical brain metastasis models (Thomas et al., 2009). This class of agents is currently
being tested in phase II clinical trials (NCT01480583 and NCT02048059, Table 2.) Other
receptors that have been exploited for receptor-mediated BBB transcytosis include the
transferrin, insulin and insulin-like growth factor-1 receptors (Eichler et al., 2011).
Another issue that remains clinically unexplored is whether active drug efflux mechanisms
compromise the delivery of therapeutics in BM. While preclinical data indicate that pglycoprotein (p-gp) mediated efflux kinetics are similar between normal BBB and BTB
(Adkins et al., 2013), clinical data suggest p-gp expression in metastatic brain tumors is
similar to that of primary, extracranial tumors and decreased compared to primary brain

tumors (Gerstner and Fine, 2007). In a murine model, a non-p-gp substrate HER2/EGFR
kinase inhibitor displayed modest but significantly better control of brain tumors compared
with lapatinib (Nakayama et al., 2013), supporting the role of active drug efflux on
pharmacokinetics and efficacy. While inhibitors of p-gp and other BBB transporters have
increased drug concentrations in the murine CNS, knowledge of their efficacy on tumor
growth of BCBM is lacking.

Targeting the brain microenvironment for successful therapy

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

In preclinical models, BM from breast cancer exhibits higher microvascular density than
their respective primary tumors (Monsky et al., 2002). These data underscore the crucial role
of the microenvironment in shaping and defining biological properties of the tumor and
suggest that BM may be more reliant on blood vessels than primary tumors. Indeed,
angiogenesis is required for efficient colonization and growth of breast cancer cells in the
brain, as inhibiting vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) receptor activation reduces
brain metastatic growth of brain-tropic breast cancer cell variants through a reduction in
angiogenesis (Kim et al., 2004). Despite the lack of an overall survival benefit with the antiVEGF antibody bevacizumab (in combination with chemotherapy) in breast cancer patients
with extracranial disease (Brufsky et al., 2011a; Robert et al., 2011), case series suggest that
patients with BM may benefit from the addition of bevacizumab to systemic chemotherapy
(Yamamoto et al., 2012). Furthermore, preliminary data from phase II clinical trials show
objective response rates of up to 75% with the combination of bevacizumab and
chemotherapy (Lin, 2013; Lu YS, 2012). This is the subject of investigation in an ongoing
clinical trial in BCBM patients (http://www.clinicaltrials.gov identifier NCT01004172,
Table 2). These findings raise the questions of whether BM are more reliant on angiogenesis
than extracranial tumors and/or if the brain endothelium is more reliant on VEGF than the
systemic vasculature. While we hypothesize the increased vascularity of BM is due to
enhanced angiogenesis, it could also result from vessel co-option, a known mechanism of
resistance to anti-VEGF therapies in primary brain tumors (di Tomaso et al., 2011; Jain,
R.K. 2014). We will be better positioned to answer these questions as findings from the
clinical trials become available.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

The crosstalk between the HER2 and VEGF pathways provides a compelling rationale for
combined approaches with HER2 targeted agents and anti-VEGF drugs. Despite the lack of
a progression-free survival benefit with bevacizumab plus trastuzumab and docetaxel in
patients with HER2-positive locally recurrent or metastatic extracranial disease (Gianni et
al., 2013), there are reasons to be optimistic for this combination in the setting of BM. The
combination of trastuzumab or lapatinib with antibodies targeting VEGF receptor-2 was
very effective in preclinical BCBM models (Kodack et al., 2012), and preliminary analysis
of a phase II clinical trial of bevacizumab, trastuzumab, and carboplatin show objective
response rates of up to 75% (Lin, 2013; Lu YS, 2012). This study is currently ongoing
(NCT01004172, see Table 2), and will determine if a phase III trial is warranted.
Furthermore, the combination of anti-VEGF therapy and dual HER2 inhibition (trastuzumab
plus lapatinib) showed the best activity in preclinical models, and is well tolerated and active
in heavily pretreated patients, including those with brain lesions (Falchook et al., 2013;
Kodack et al., 2012).

Our studies have also shown that trastuzumab can induce vessel normalization in preclinical
models of HER2 overexpressing BCBM (Izumi et al., 2002), a feature that is associated with
improved tumor oxygenation and radiosensitization (Winkler et al., 2004). This finding
provides a rationale to combine trastuzumab with radiotherapy, and we await the results of a
completed phase II trial designed to test this combination (NCT01363986, see Table 2).

Future approaches for treating BCBM

NIH-PA Author Manuscript
NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Additional approaches focus on the use of novel targeting agents for BCBM. Recently the
novel antibody-chemotherapy conjugate ado-trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1) was approved
for the treatment of HER2-positive breast cancer. Approval was based on the prospective
phase III trial EMILIA, which revealed that T-DM1 was superior to lapatinib and
capecitabine in patients with disease progression after trastuzumab (Verma et al., 2012). If
reduced efficacy of trastuzumab in BM is not due solely to inefficient delivery, but instead
due to acquired or microenvironment-mediated activation of alternative signaling pathways,
T-DM1 would be expected to be effective in these patients. This hypothesis is supported by
preclinical findings (Askoxylakis et al., unpublished data), case reports (Bartsch et al., 2014)
and a subgroup analysis (asymptomatic brain metastases) in a randomized, open-label, phase
III trial of previously treated (physician’s choice) metastatic HER2-positive patients (Krop
et al., 2014). Furthermore, new generation ErbB family inhibitors, more potent and specific
than lapatinib (neratinib and afatinib), showed significant responses in single cases of
BCBM (Yap et al., 2010). Prospective clinical trials (NCT01494662 and NCT01441596)
investigating the efficacy of these drugs in patients with BCBM are currently accruing (see
Table 2). In addition, the elucidation of mechanisms of de novo or acquired resistance to
anti-HER2 therapy in systemic disease led to the evaluation of downstream HER2 signaling
inhibitors in BM, including the PI3K inhibitor BKM120 and the mTOR inhibitor
everolimus, either alone or in combination with trastuzumab (see Table 2). Furthermore, the
HER2 family member HER3, critical for HER2 downstream signaling, is enriched in human
BM compared to matched primary breast tumors (Da Silva et al., 2010). Indeed, inhibiting
HER3 activity enhances the efficacy of HER2-targeted therapies in preclinical models of
BCBM (Kodack et al., unpublished data). The role of immunotherapy in cancer treatment is
a subject of major interest in recent years, but not much is known with regard to BCBM.
Knowledge from other malignancies, such as the activity of ipilimumab in patients with
cerebral metastases from malignant melanoma (Margolin et al., 2012), suggests that immune
system modulation might be of promise, and emphasizes the necessity for studies in this
direction. Brain metastatic lesions from breast cancer contain activated microglia, and,
although the brain is considered immune privileged, preclinical studies clearly showed that
the peripheral immune system enters the brain parenchyma after CNS insult (Ousman and
Kubes, 2012). Indirect activation of NK cells, CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, through CpG
oligodeoxynucleotide treatment, prevented brain metastasis of murine breast carcinoma cells
injected into syngeneic mice, but failed to slow the growth of established BM (Xiong et al.,
2008).

Conclusions/Perspective
NIH-PA Author Manuscript
NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Better therapies for BCBM are needed. The efficacy of existing therapies, used for the
treatment of systemic disease, is largely unclear in patients with BM, mainly due to the fact
that the presence of BM served as an exclusion criterion for most prospective trials,
including the phase III studies TH3RESA, CLEOPATRA, and EMILIA. Therefore, to better
understand the efficacy of standard targeted therapies, patients with BM must be included in
clinical trials. Furthermore, analysis of clinical tissue to confirm preclinical data and
determine clinical evidence of suspected resistance mechanisms is necessary. While a
number of preclinical reports identify genes that mediate BM, most describe those necessary
for the initial steps of brain metastatic colonization. This provides essential information and
rationale for clinical applications on metastasis prevention; however, the central issue of
effective treatment of established BM remains open. In this respect there are unanswered
questions that need to be addressed: Is treatment resistance of BM due to a lack of drug
penetration into the brain lesion? Has the brain metastatic cancer cell evolved to evade the
same therapy to which its predecessors are sensitive? Does the brain microenvironment
provide factors that enable cancer cells to become resistant, and if so, what are these crucial
determinants of resistance? What is the role of intratumoral heterogeneity? How can
microenvironment-targeted therapies, such as anti-angiogenic or immunotherapy, improve
the therapeutic efficacy?

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Despite the lack of definitive answers to these questions, recent data provide some insight
that could drive future approaches. The reduced efficacy of antibody-based therapies in the
brain has been attributed to the decreased permeability through the BBB, however the
efficacy of bevacizumab or T-DM1 suggests adequate penetration of antibodies into the
brain metastatic lesion and encourages the investigation of other large molecule therapies in
the BM setting. If therapies are indeed achieving adequate concentrations within BM then
resistance could be attributed to non-pharmacokinetic mechanisms. Specific features of the
brain microenvironment and current biological aspects of the seed and soil hypothesis have
been implicated in treatment resistance. This seems, however, not to be a universal
phenomenon, but instead may be dependent on the nature of the parental lesion. Whereas the
majority of HER2-positive BCBM are resistant to targeted therapies, the response rates of
lung cancer or melanoma BM to EGFR or BRAF inhibitors, respectively, are similar to
extracranial disease (Lombardi et al., 2014). This suggests a unique crosstalk between the
brain microenvironment and biological features of breast cancer cells that need to be
investigated in further detail. Successful therapies may consist of combinatorial approaches
targeting the tumor stroma in addition to the cancer cell, while limiting neuronal damage.
Finally, intratumoral heterogeneity should be taken into account. Discordance between
primary disease and metastatic lesions has been described (Niikura et al., 2012). This
heterogeneity makes the interactions between tumor cells and the microenvironment more
complicated, and emphasizes the need to select an appropriate therapeutic strategy based on
characteristics of the metastases rather than the primary tumor. In conclusion, despite major
preclinical and clinical progress in the characterization, prevention and management of BM,
the multitude and complexity of the remaining questions to be answered will require a
tighter integration between bench and bedside.

Figure 1. Schematic of notable targets of BCBM formation identified in preclinical studies (see
Table 1)

Molecules are categorized based on the stage of the metastatic cascade in which it is
involved. Brain-tropic circulating tumors cells (CTC) may express a particular signature,
such as EpCAM-/HER2+/EGFR+/HPSE+/Notch1+ (Zhang et al., 2013). While drug
delivery into brain metastatic lesions is compromised by the BTB, the ease of access is
greater than in the normal brain (with an intact BBB). Methods used to enhance drug
delivery are also mentioned.

Outcome

SERPINs also mediate survival of
brain metastatic lung cancer cell
lines. L1CAM is a major vessel

Both stromal and tumor derived
Cathepsin blocked for effect.
VBY-999 not effective on
established brain metastases.
Increased expression in BM
clinical tissue.

Knockdown of FBP2 does not
reduce primary tumor growth.
Highlights microenvironmentspecific regulation of tumor
metabolism.

Spontaneous brain metastasis.
Trebananib improves BBB
integrity. Ang-2 is secreted by
endothelial cells.

Monotherapy does not
significantly decrease BM.
Effective on established BM.
Increased expression in BM
clinical tissue. Treatment study

Picropodophyllin used to block
IGF-IR in vitro but not in vivo.

High KLF4 expression is
inversely correlated with brain
metastasis-free survival. miR-7 is
downregulated and KLF4
upregulated in BM clinical tissue.

BMP-2 promotes differentiation
of NPCs into astrocytes.
Expressed in BM clinical tissue.

Evades efflux mechanism since
not a p-glycoprotein substrate.
Treatment study

HA conjugate increases delivery
of Paclitaxel into the brain by
bypassing p-glycoprotein
mediated efflux.
