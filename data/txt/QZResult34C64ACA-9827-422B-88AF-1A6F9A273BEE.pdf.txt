ABSTRACT
Objective and Methods: In this phase 1b study, patients with stage 4 or
unresectable stage 3 melanoma were treated with escalating doses of lenvatinib
(once daily) and temozolomide (TMZ) (days 1–5) in 28-day cycles, to determine the
maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of the combination. Dose Level (DL)1: lenvatinib
20 mg, TMZ 100 mg/m2; DL2: lenvatinib 24 mg, TMZ 100 mg/m2; DL3: lenvatinib
24 mg, TMZ 150 mg/m2. Adverse events (AEs) were recorded and tumor response
assessed per RECIST 1.0.
Results: Dose-limiting toxicity occurred in 1 of 32 treated patients (DL1); MTD was
not reached. The highest dose administered was lenvatinib 24 mg + TMZ 150 mg/m2.
Most common treatment-related AEs included fatigue (56.3%), hypertension (53.1%),
and proteinuria (46.9%). Overall objective response rate was 18.8% (6 patients),
all partial response; (DL1, n = 1; DL3, n = 5). Stable disease (SD) ≥ 16 weeks was
observed in 28.1% of patients (DL1 and DL2, n = 1 each; DL3, n = 7); 12.5% of
patients had SD ≥ 23 weeks. Single and repeat-dose pharmacokinetics of lenvatinib
were comparable across cycles and with concomitant TMZ administration.
Conclusion: Lenvatinib 24 mg/day + TMZ 150 mg/m2/day (days 1–5) demonstrated
modest clinical activity, an acceptable safety profile, and was administered without
worsening of either lenvatinib- or TMZ-related toxicities in this patient group.

(an  anti-PD1 receptor immune checkpoint inhibitor
monoclonal antibody). Median overall survival with standard
treatment is 7–15.9 months, and response rates range from
10.2% to 53% [3–8]. Unfortunately, some patients do not
respond, and most still develop recurrent disease.
Angiogenesis—the formation of new blood vessels—
is critical for tumor survival and progression [1, 2]. Genetic
aberrations associated with angiogenic signaling pathways
mediated by growth factors, including vascular endothelial
growth factor (VEGF), fibroblast growth factor (FGF),
and platelet-derived growth factor  (PDGF), have been
correlated with progression in metastatic melanoma [1, 2].

INTRODUCTION
Melanoma has one of the fastest increasing incidence
rates of any cancer [1, 2]. According to 2014 estimates,
there were 76,100 new cases of, and 9710 deaths from,
malignant melanoma in the United States. Approved
treatments for metastatic melanoma have only recently
demonstrated significant activity. These treatments include
ipilimumab (human cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen
4-blocking antibody), vemurafenib, dabrafenib (BRAF
inhibitors),  trametinib (MEK inhibitor), pembrolizumab
(anti-programmed cell death 1 antibody), and nivolumab

Dose-limiting toxicities and maximum
tolerated dose

Lenvatinib (E7080) is an orally active multikinase
inhibitor of VEGF-receptor (VEGFR) 1–3, FGF-receptor
(FGFR) 1–4, PDGF-receptor (PDGFR)-α, RET, and
KIT proto-oncogenes [9]. In phase 1 studies, lenvatinib
showed antitumor activity in solid-tumor patients at a
maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of 25 mg/day [10, 11].
Temozolomide (TMZ) is an oral chemotherapeutic agent
that shows evidence of response and similar efficacy
to that of dacarbazine in melanoma, but it is also able to
cross the blood–brain barrier, giving it a possible role in the
treatment of melanoma patients with brain metastases [12].
TMZ is metabolized through nonenzymatic pH-dependent
hydrolysis, and, therefore, has low potential for drug-drug
interactions [13]. The combination of an alkylating agent
and VEGF inhibitor has been previously proposed. In
in vitro studies and in vivo xenograft models of melanoma,
treatment with dacarbazine increased VEGF expression,
providing a potential resistance mechanism to monotherapy
[14, 15]. Preclinical data from a human melanoma xenograft
study that evaluated a combination of lenvatinib and TMZ
showed preliminary evidence of an additive efficacy (Eisai,
Inc.; data on file).
We report here the phase 1b results of a phase
1/1b study conducted to determine the MTD and
pharmacokinetic profile of lenvatinib when given once
daily in combination with TMZ as treatment for advanced
melanoma. The safety and tolerability of the combination,
tumor response, and potential biomarkers of efficacy of
this combination were also evaluated.

One dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) (grade 3
proteinuria) occurred in DL1. The MTD was not reached
because no patients experienced a DLT at the highest
combination dose (DL3). Investigators chose not to escalate
the lenvatinib dosage beyond 24 mg/day (the established
MTD for lenvatinib) or TMZ dose beyond 150 mg/m2 (the
conventional dose level when combined with other drugs).

Safety
The safety population was comprised of all
32 patients receiving at least 1 dose of study drug. Fatigue
(56%), hypertension (53%), and proteinuria (47%)
were the most commonly observed study-drug-related
toxicities (Table 2). The most common National Cancer
Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse
Events (version 3.0) grade 3 study-drug-related toxicities
in the overall study population were asthenia (13%),
hypertension (9%), fatigue (6%), hyponatremia (6%),
and proteinuria (6%), with most grade 3 toxicities seen in
DL3 (Table 2). Only 1 grade 4 drug-related toxicity (DL3;
myocardial infarction) occurred and was handled through
dose adjustment. Overall, 31.3% of patients experienced
only grade 1–2 toxicities. A total of 3 patients died during
treatment or within 30 days of last dose. All 3 deaths
appear to have been due to disease progression.

Pharmacokinetics

RESULTS

Overall, single-dose and repeat-dose PK parameters
of lenvatinib were comparable across cycles and with
concomitant TMZ administration (Supplementary Table 1).
Lenvatinib area under the concentration-time curve
extrapolation to time (AUC(0–τ)), area under the curve from
time 0 extrapolated to infinite time (AUC(0–inf)), and peak
plasma concentration (Cmax) were similar across the 3 cohorts
following single- and repeat-dose administration. Similarly,
the median time to peak concentration (tmax), terminal 1/2
life (t1/2), and clearance after oral administration (CL/F)
estimates for lenvatinib were independent of the dose of
lenvatinib or TMZ regimen. Following administration of
treatment on cycle 2 day 1, the median tmax ranged between
1 to 8 hours across the cohorts, and there was no apparent
accumulation upon repeated administration of lenvatinib
alone or in combination with TMZ (data not shown).

Patients
A total of 32 patients with metastatic melanoma
were enrolled across the 3 dose levels (DLs): DL1,
n = 6; DL2, n = 4; and DL3, n = 22. The demographics
and baseline characteristics for the overall study
population are summarized in Table 1. The median age of
patients was 57.5 years (range, 24–81). The majority of
patients (65.6%) had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology
Group (ECOG) performance score of 1, 62.5% were
male, and 84% had received at least 1 prior chemotherapy
regimen. Two patients, both in DL3, had previously
received ipilimumab. The BRAFV600E tumor mutation was
present in 7 (44%) of 16 evaluable patients and the NRAS
tumor mutation was present in 6 (50%) of 12 evaluable
patients.
Overall, 22 (68.8%) patients discontinued the
study due to progressive disease (PD) or clinical
deterioration (DL1, n = 4; DL2, n =  3; DL3, n = 15).
Additionally, 5 patients withdrew consent (DL1, n = 1;
DL3, n = 4), and 1 patient from each group discontinued
due to adverse events (AEs) AEs (DL1) and physician’s
decision (DL2). Three patients (9.4%) died either during
study treatment or within 30 days after last dose (DL1,
n = 2; DL3, n = 2).

Tumor response and duration of treatment
Patients in DL1 received a median of 3.0 (range 1.5)
cycles of both lenvatinib and TMZ, patients in DL2 received
a median of 3.0 (2.0, 4.0) cycles of lenvatinib and 2.5 (2.0,
4.0) cycles of TMZ, and patients in DL3 received a median
of 4.0 (1.0, 7.0) cycles of lenvatinib and 3.5 (1.0, 7.0) cycles
of TMZ. At the time of data cutoff, there were 4  partial
responses (PRs) observed, with 3 patients still undergoing

The combination therapy of lenvatinib and TMZ
generally had an acceptable toxicity profile in patients
with advanced melanoma, and it was given at the
highest level of DL3 without apparent worsening of
either lenvatinib- or TMZ-related toxicities. The most
common treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs)
considered related to study drug by investigators included
fatigue, hypertension, proteinuria, hypothyroidism, and
anorexia. The incidences of several TEAEs, including
hypothyroidism and thrombocytopenia (46.9% each), in this
combination study were higher compared with those in a
study of lenvatinib alone (15.6% and 13.0%, respectively).
This difference may be due to the combination treatment
(lenvatinib plus TMZ) or due to TMZ alone.
TMZ has a safety and efficacy profile similar to the
current standard of care, dacarbazine. A benefit of adding
TMZ to metastatic melanoma therapy may be its ability
to cross the blood-brain barrier [12]. Single-agent TMZ
has been associated with response rates of 0% to 29% in
patients with metastatic melanoma [12]. In combination
with interferon alpha, response rates of 13% to 23% have
been reported [12]. An uncontrolled phase 2 study of TMZ
in combination with sorafenib also demonstrated activity
in TMZ-naïve patients with melanoma, including patients
with brain metastases [16].
In the present study of TMZ and lenvatinib as
a combination therapy, we observed a best overall
response of PR in 18.8%, and SD ≥ 16 weeks in 28.1%
of the overall population. In addition, 4 patients in DL3
experienced durable SD ≥ 23 weeks. Best overall response
was not evaluable or censored in 4 patients. However, the
response rates observed with TMZ and lenvatinib in the
present study are lower than a 61% objective response rate
(44 of 72 patients) observed in patients with melanoma
receiving a combination of ipilimumab and nivolumab
[17], and lower than a 31.7% objective response rate (38 or
120 patients) observed in a phase 3 trial of nivolumab in
patients with metastatic melanoma whose disease had
progressed after previous treatment with ipilimumab, or
treatment with ipilimumab and a BRAF inhibitor if their
tumors harbored a BRAF V600E mutation [18].
Overall, in our analysis of pharmacokinetic
parameters, we found that the single-dose and repeat-dose
pharmacokinetics of lenvatinib were comparable across
cycles and with concomitant TMZ administration. Estimates
of t1/2, tmax, and CL/F for lenvatinib were independent of
the dose of lenvatinib or TMZ. The pharmacokinetics of
lenvatinib 24 mg in combination with TMZ was comparable
to that seen when lenvatinib was given as a monotherapy
and there was no evidence for accumulation upon repeated
administration of lenvatinib alone or in combination
with TMZ.
Angiopoietins are ligands of the endothelial cell
receptor soluble Tie-2 (sTie-2) and have crucial roles in
tumor angiogenic switches [1]. In malignant melanoma,
soluble angiopoietin-2 (sAng-2) levels are elevated and
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

may function as part of an autocrine Ang-2/Tie2 growth
loop. Circulating levels of sAng-2 have been correlated
with tumor load, disease stage, and overall survival [19].
The relationship observed between maximum tumor
shrinkage (MTS) and change in levels of Ang-2 in the
current study suggests that this angiogenic pathway may
be associated with the activity of lenvatinib.
The tumor gene mutation analyses performed in this
study indicated that BRAFWT status appeared to correlate
with better response to this combination treatment. No
clear correlation between response and NRAS mutation
status could be made. Due to the fairly small sample size
and exploratory nature of these biomarker analyses, these
findings should be further explored in larger ongoing
studies of lenvatinib.
In conclusion, the combination of lenvatinib
with TMZ had an acceptable toxicity profile and can be
administered without increase in toxicity of either agent.
This combination therapy demonstrated modest clinical
activity in a population of patients with unresectable
stage 3 or stage 4 melanoma. These results will be further
confirmed in ongoing phase 2 studies of lenvatinib in
advanced melanoma. Additional studies are also underway
to further explore the potential role of lenvatinib in
treatment of advanced or metastatic melanoma.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients
This was a phase 1/1b, open-label study
(NCT00121680) conducted at the University of Texas
MD Anderson Cancer Center and the Mary Crowley
Cancer Research Center. The main inclusion criteria
were: patients aged ≥ 18 years with a histological and/or
cytological confirmed diagnosis of advanced or metastatic
melanoma untreatable by standard therapies; melanoma
lesions amenable to biopsy; adequate renal, hepatic, and
hematologic parameters; and an ECOG performance status
of 0 or 1. Patients who were intolerant of TMZ or any
of its excipients, pregnant, required full-dose aspirin or
chronic nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, or were
untreated for or had unstable central nervous system
metastases were excluded.
The study was conducted in accordance with World
Medical Association Declaration of Helsinki and the
International Conference on Harmonization of Technical
Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for
Human Use guidelines. Prior to study participation, all
participants provided written informed consent. The
Mary Crowley Cancer Research Center and University of
Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center Institutional Review
Boards approved the study. A separate publication details
results of the monotherapy portion of the phase 1 study
of lenvatinib in solid tumors (including a melanoma
population).

levels of additional serum cytokine and angiogenic factors
(CAF), including Ang-2, sVEGFR1-3, sTie-2, PDGF-AB,
PDGF-BB, VEGFA, FGF4, VEGFD, hepatocyte growth
factor, FMS-related tyrosine kinase 3 ligand (FLT3LG),
and placental growth factor were evaluated. CAFs were
measured in house by Eisai.
Safety assessments were performed in each
cycle by physical examination, weekly blood pressure
monitoring, periodic measurement of vital signs and
electrocardiograms, ECOG performance status evaluation,
and regular monitoring of hematology, blood chemistry,
and urine values. All AEs and serious AEs were recorded.
Tumor assessments were conducted at baseline and
approximately every 8 weeks during treatment. Responses
were confirmed after ≥ 30 days using Response Evaluation
Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST), version 1.0 [20].
Tumor responses were assessed by computed tomography,
magnetic resonance imaging, or, in the case of skin lesions,
photography and clinical examination. Tumor responses
were classified as either complete response (CR), PR, SD,
or progressive disease (PD). SD was further stratified as
SD maintained for ≥ 7weeks and ≥ 16 weeks, and durable
SD was defined as SD maintained for ≥ 23 weeks.

This phase 1b study utilized a standard “3+3” doseescalation scheme to evaluate the MTD of lenvatinib in
combination with TMZ. Patients were treated in sequential
cohorts of escalating dosing of lenvatinib (continuous
once daily) and TMZ (days 1–5) in a 28-day treatment
cycle. The initial doses were lenvatinib 20 mg once daily
with TMZ 100 mg/m2/day for days 1–5 (DL1). Subsequent
doses were lenvatinib 24 mg with TMZ 100 mg/m2 (DL2)
and lenvatinib 24 mg with TMZ 150 mg/m2 (DL3).
DLTs were assessed once the first 3 patients completed
1 treatment cycle. Any of the following events was defined
as a DLT: any hematologic toxicity of grade 3 or higher;
any nonhematologic toxicity of grade 3 or higher, with the
exception of grade 3 hypertension that could be controlled
(via intensification of single agent antihypertensive
treatment or by adding a second antihypertensive); and any
failure to administer ≥ 75% of the study drugs during cycle
1 due to treatment-related toxicities. The MTD was defined
as the highest dose tolerated by a minimum of 5 out of the
first 6 treated patients.

Procedures

Tumor mutation analysis

Blood samples were collected on cycle 1, day 1
(C1D1) immediately prior to the first dose of lenvatinib
and at 0.25, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 5, 8, and 24 hours
following administration on C1D1 and day 1 cycle 2.
Additional samples were collected prior to lenvatinib
administration on days 8, 15, and 22 of cycle 1, as well
as on day 1 of cycles 3 and 4. Tmax, Cmax, Ctrough, AUC0-t,
CL (total body clearance from plasma), Vss (volume of
distribution at steady rate), and t1/2 were evaluated.
Pharmacodynamic assessments of lenvatinib
were conducted based on serum samples collected prior
to study drug administration and at 2 hours following
administration on C1D1, as well as prior to administration
on days 8, 15, and 22 of cycle 1. Serum samples were
tested for angiogenesis-related markers (MDS Pharma/
Clearstone Central Lab) and apoptosis-related (Pathway
Diagnostics/Quest) markers. These angiogenesisrelated markers were PDGF-homodimer BB, sTie-2
(receptor expressed by endothelial cells), angiopoietin-1
(Tie-2 ligand), soluble E-selectin (mediates leukocyte
and tumor cell rolling), and soluble c-kit. The apoptosisrelated markers assessed were cytochrome C (a measure
of intrinsic apoptotic pathway activation) and M30
neoantigen (caspase-cleaved cytokeratin-18, also a
terminal apoptotic product for epithelial-derived tumors).
sTie-2, angiopoietin-1, PDGF-BB, soluble e-selectin,
soluble c-kit, cytochrome C, and M30 were measured
by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. PDGF-BB was
assayed by Luminex Technology using Growth Factor
Buffer Reagent and a Human Custom Multiplex Antibody
Bead Kit from BioSource Invitrogen (Frederick, MD).
Pretreatment (baseline) and posttreatment changes in
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Paraffin-embedded tumor samples were macrodis­
sected using a dissecting microscope and analyzed for
BRAF and NRAS mutations at the Clinical Laboratory
Improvement Amendments-certified Molecular Diagnostics
Laboratory at MD Anderson using standard operating
procedures.

Statistical analysis
Baseline and demographic variables including age,
gender, race, height, weight, and ECOG performance
score were summarized using descriptive statistics.
Plasma concentrations of lenvatinib were analyzed and
summarized using descriptive statistics for the following
pharmacokinetic parameters: CL/F, AUC, Cmax, Ctrough, tmax,
and t1/2. Pearson and Spearman correlation coefficients
were calculated between pharmacokinetic parameters
and serum biomarkers at different time points compared
with baseline to examine the correlation between drug
exposure and biomarkers. Univariate and multivariate Cox
proportional hazards models and log-rank tests were used
to examine the relationship between PFS and baseline
(and change from baseline) concentrations in angiogenesis
and apoptosis biomarkers. Cumulative chi-square test
was used to examine the correlation between mutation/
serum biomarkers and best overall response. Pearson and
Spearman correlation coefficients were also calculated
between percent MTS (defined as percent change in sum
of longest diameter from baseline to nadir using RECIST
criteria) and serum biomarkers at different time points
compared with baseline.
