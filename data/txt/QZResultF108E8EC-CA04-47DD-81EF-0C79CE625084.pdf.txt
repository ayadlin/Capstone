ABSTRACT
Modulation and suppression of the host immune response by nematode parasites
have been reported extensively and the cysteine protease inhibitor (cystatin) is
identified as one of the major immunomodulator. In the present study, we cloned and
produced recombinant cystatin protein from nematode parasite Haemonchus contortus
(rHCcyst-2) and investigated its immunomodulatory effects on goat monocyte. rHCcyst-2
protein is biologically functional as shown by its ability to inhibit the protease activity of
cathepsin L, cathepsin B and papain. Immunohistochemical test demonstrated that the
native HCcyst-2 protein was predominantly localized at the body surface and internal
surface of the worm’s gut. We demonstrated that rHCcyst-2 could be distinguished by
antisera from goats experimentally infected with H. contortus and could uptake by goat
monocytes. The immunomodulatory effects of HCcyst-2 on cytokine secretion, MHC
molecule expression, NO production and phagocytosis were observed by co-incubation
of rHCcyst-2 with goat monocytes. The results showed that the interaction of rHCcyst-2
decreased the production of TNF-α, IL-1β and IL-12p40. However, it significantly
increased the secretion of IL-10 in goat monocytes. After rHCcyst-2 exposure, the
expression of MHC-II on goat monocytes was inhibited. Moreover, rHCcyst-2 could
up-regulate the LPS induced NO production of goat monocytes. Phagocytotic assay
by FITC-dextran internalization showed that rHCcyst-2 inhibited the phagocytosis of
goat monocytes. Our findings provided potential target as immunoregulator, and will
be helpful to illustrate the molecular basis of host–parasite interactions and search for
new potential molecule as vaccine and drug target candidate.

variety of organisms, including, invertebrates, vertebrates,
plants and even in protozoa [3, 4]. Previous researches
demonstrated that cystatins from various vertebrate species
are involved in biological processes, such as immune
system development, antigen presentation, epidermal
homeostasis, neutrophil chemotaxis during the mechanism
of inflammation and apoptosis [5–8].
The abomasal blood feeding nematode parasite
Haemonchus contortus (H. contortus), is an economical
challenge to the livestock industry worldwide, causes
severe infection that lead to anaemia, lethargy and even
death of the animal, mainly in young lambs [9, 10].
The gastrointestinal nematodes or parasites which exist
within tissues of their hosts continuously exposed to a

INTRODUCTION
The cystatins belongs to superfamily of enzymes
which consists of evolutionary tight-binding inhibitors to
form reversible complexes of papain-like cysteine proteases
[1]. Based on sequence motifs and the conserved domains,
cystatins are categorized into four subfamilies, the type
1 cystatins or stefins are cytoplasmic proteins lacking
of signal peptides, contrary to that type 2 cystatins are
secretory-type proteins, which exhibits signal peptides in its
structure. Whereas, third type of cystatin proteins also called
kininogens and fourth type of cystatin-like proteins named as
fetuins and histidine-rich proteins [2]. It has been evaluated
that proteins belong to the cystatins family are existing in a

range of immune effector mechanisms. To survive within
the host environment, parasites has to adopt a strategy
to manage within the immune responses by the release
of immunomodulatory constituents that halt effector
mechanisms or intermingle with the cytokine network
[11]. Both complexity of mammalian innate and adaptive
immune mechanisms and the long co-evolutionary
association during host-parasite interface, play a
considerable role in the number of molecular interactions
[12]. Many studies have been conducted in recent years,
which shown that cystatins from various nematode
parasites act as major immune modulators during host
parasite interactions [4, 13].
In the present study, a cystatin gene from H.
contortus was cloned and a recombinant protein was
produced to analyse its immune modulatory activity. We
found that the recombinant cystatin from H. contortus
(rHCcyst-2) significantly modulated goat monocyte
function in multiple aspects.

contains a conserved N-terminal glycine, QXVXG and
PW motifs and one disulfide bond in its structure, which
is highly conserved in most of the cystatin proteins such as
cystatin 2 (Figure 1). By using SMART analysis (Schultz
et al., 2000), a cystatin-like domain in the putative amino
acid sequence at position 22–137 was detected. Protein
sequence analysis for the predicted amino acid sequences
against all non-redundant databases by using BLASTP
revealed a significant similarity scores with members of
the cystatin type 2 families of nematodes. The protein
sequence analysis by using Signal P program detected a
clear signal peptide with predicted cleavage site between
amino acids 18 and 19.

Expression and purification of rHCcyst-2
The purified gene sequence that encodes a HCcyst-2
protein, was successfully inserted into the bacterial
expression vector pET32a, and confirmed by sequence the
sequence ligation into correct reading frame. The expressed
recombinant protein was detected as a double His 6 tagged
fusion protein with a predicted molecular mass of 34 kDa
(Figure 2A). Then the rHCcyst-2 protein expressed in a
soluble form was purified by affinity chromatography with
His·Bind®128 Resin Chromatography kit (Novagen) as per
manufacturer’s protocol. The purified protein product of
rHCcyst-2 was resolved on SDS-PAGE with estimated
purity more than 95 %.

Western blot analysis

Proteinase inhibition assays

To determine the exposure of HCcyst-2 protein to
the host immune system, serum from goats experimentally
infected with H. contortus was used as primary antibody
against rHCcyst-2. Immunoblot analysis detected that
rHCcyst-2 could recognized by the sera from goat
experimentally infected with H. contortus (Figure 2B).
These findings suggested that HCcyst-2 could interact
with host immune system during infection process.

The inhibitory effect of HCcyst-2 for its overlapping
target enzymes was investigated by using purified
recombinant cystatin against papain-like cysteine
proteases and caspase 1 as another family protease to
verify the target specificity of HCcyst-2. Our results
highlighted that rHCcyst-2 could efficiently halt papain
and cathepsin L activity, whereas rHCcyst-2 showed a
lesser effective role on the inhibitory activity of cathepsin
B and no inhibitory action with caspase 1 (Figure 4 and
Table 1).

Immuno-localization of HCcyst-2
A partial body section of an adult female worm
was used to detect HCcyst-2 protein localization through
immunohistochemical analysis, as shown in Figure 3.
HCcyst-2 protein and nuclei of cells fluoresced as red and
blue respectively. The antibody eluted from rHCcyst-2
bound predominantly to the body surface as well as in gut
surface of the worm’s body (Figure 3) and no labeling was
observed in control experiments.

Goat monocytes can uptake the rHCcyst-2
Goat monocytes were incubated with rHCcyst-2 and
the protein uptake by monocytes was investigated by an
immunofluorescence approach. As depicted in Figure 5,
the emission from the Cy3-labeled rHCcyst-2 was red,
the DAPI-labeled nuclei were blue and DiO-labeled cell
membrane was green. No fluorescence was observed under

MHC-I expression in response to different concentrations
of rHCcyst-2 protein, compared to the control buffer.

The alteration of secreted cytokine levels

The nitrate concentration of the culture supernatant
was significantly increased by serial concentrations of
rHCcyst-2 protein. Our results suggested that rHCcyst-2
could up-regulate the LPS induced NO production of goat
monocytes (Figure 8).

NO production

The ELISA method was used to detect the cytokines
expression level in goat monocytes. Our results showed
that rHCcyst-2 decreased the LPS induced production
of TNF-α, IL-1β and IL-12p40 whereas, rHCcyst-2
significantly augmented the IL-10 production in goat
monocytes at dose-dependent manner compared to the LPS
treated only (Figure 6). No significantly difference was
observed in the secretion of TGF-β1 at different groups.

Capacity of phagocytosis
Phagocytic capacity of goat monocytes after 48 h
treatment with different concentrations of rHCcyst-2 was
examined. As shown in Figure 9, rHCcyst-2 significantly
decreased the FITC-dextran uptake ability of goat
monocytes in a dose-dependent manner.

following the exposure to rHCcyst-2 were evaluated
(Figure 7). The MHC-II expression in cells treated with
rHCcyst-2 was significantly reduced at different protein

mammalian host [14]. There are several reports which
show the modulation of immune responses generated by
the nematode parasites that inhabit in the gastrointestinal
tract of their hosts [15, 16]. Cystatins associated with
nematode parasites infection, have been recognized as
significant immunomodulators [11]. The target cells
of cystatin-induced immunomodulation seem to be
monocytes, as depletion of monocytes from the PBMC
reversed the inhibitory effects of O. volvulus cystatin
[17]. In this study, we cloned a type 2 cystatin gene from
H. contortus, HCcyst-2, produced recombinant HCcyst-2
protein and examined its immunomodulatory effects on
goat monocytes.
In previous study, the characterization of various
cystatins, and their capacities to inhibit the activity of
cysteine proteases was evaluated. Our study showed that
a histidine-tagged fused protein (rHCcyst-2) could inhibit
the papain, cathepsin B and cathepsin L activity, and it
also declared a strong suppressive effect against papain.
The rHCcyst-2 showed comparatively lesser inhibitory
role against cathepsin B, this might be due to an blocking
loop that prevent the formation of substrate and inhibitor
complex at the active site of cathepsin B [18]. Previously,
many studies showed the absence of inhibitory action for
number of cystatins [15, 17, 19].
As compared to type 1 cystatins, the type 2
cystatins are secretion-type proteins that possess
signal peptides in its structure. Previously, Type 2
cystatins were demonstrated as excretory/secretory (ES)
products of parasites from Nippostrongylus brasiliensis,
Heligmosomoides polygyrus, Litomosoides sigmodontis

and Brugia malayi [12, 15, 20, 21]. In present study, we
found that rHCcyst-2 could be detected by the sera of
goats experimentally diseased with H. contortus and the
native HCcyst-2 protein was localized externally as well
as internal surface of the parasite’s gut. Helminths parasite
cystatins play immune modulating functions based on a
hypothesis that host monocyte/macrophage could uptake
parasite cystatins [22]. Further, we demonstrated that
goat monocyte could uptake rHCcyst-2 in vitro. All of
these results indicated that H. contortus type 2 cystatins
are excretory/secretory antigens capable to intermingle
with the host immune mechanisms during host-parasite
interactions. The continuous secretions and desired
concentrations of these ES molecules are suggested to
be a basic requirement for immunomodulatory functions.
However, how the HCcyst-2 accrues to the functional
concentration in vivo, and the real mechanisms or
pathways involved in host parasite interactions during
natural infection of H. contortus are worthy for further
studied. Besides of their inhibitory activity on proteases,
the nematode cystatins also exert substantial effect
on the host’s cytokines production. Previously, it was
investigated that filarial cystatins play a key role to induce
several cytokines expression levels which could lead antiinflammatory responses [11]. A previous investigation
showed an increased level of TNF-α response and IL-10
production in human PBMCs whereas, a decreased level
of the IL-12 cytokine was found in response to the O.
volvulus cystatin [17]. The antigen-specific expression
of IFN-γ and IL-4 was decreased in mice splenocytes
treated with rNbCys compared to mice treated with control

protein. The mice bone-marrow-derived dendritic cell
stimulated with Toll-like receptor ligand CpG, showed
decrease level of TNF-α and IL-6 cytokine expression in
presence of rHp-CPI. Our results showed that rHCcyst-2
decreased the LPS, induced production of TNF-α, IL-1β
and IL-12p40 in goat monocytes. However, rHCcyst-2
significantly induced the production of IL-10 in goat

monocytes in a dose-dependent manner compared with
LPS treated only. The cytokines profile modulated by
rHCcyst-2 contributes to induce an anti-inflammatory
environment which is favorable for the survival of worms.
NO being a non-cytokine based immune cellderived molecule has been suggested to involve in
majority of immune responses during parasitic infections

[23, 24]. Another important biological function of the NO
was demonstrated to regulate the innate immune response
against parasite protozoa in context of retard growth
and inhibition of invasion process into the host [25–28].
Apart from its diverse biological functions NO has been
suggested as an inhibitor for lymphocyte proliferation
in vitro and a key modulator for the regulation of
cytokines expression in various cell types [29, 30]. In
the present study, rHCcyst-2 significantly enhanced the
NO production by LPS treated goat monocytes. Previous
studies showed that the NO production in IFN-γ-activated
murine macrophages was substantially induced in various
members of the cystatin superfamily such as human
stefin B, rat T-kininogen and chicken cystatin [24]. This
possibility has not been shown for synthetic inhibitors like
E64; a natural cysteine protease inhibitors, to increase the
NO production [31]. Interestingly, cystatins superfamily
of nematodes compared to other members of the cystatin,
potentially up-regulate the NO production in IFN-γ
activated macrophages regardless the parasitic or freeliving state of parasites [4, 31, 32]. In previous study, the
decreased level of antigen-specific T cell proliferation
in a murine model of filariasis was associated with NO
production [33]. In several previous studies, it was
revealed that parasitic nematode cystatins can inhibit
antigen-specific T cell proliferation in vitro and in vivo
[20, 32, 34]. The up-regulation of NO production in LPS
treated goat monocytes in the presence of rHCcyst-2 might

suggest a T cell proliferation inhibition event, occurs
when HCcyst-2 released by parasites in parasitic stage.
However, we guess further study be needed.
The phagocytosis mechanism of the immune system,
largely depends upon an effective role of phagocytic cells
in the elimination of pathogen/disease causing agents
[35]. In this context the macrophages play an important
role because of their ability to engulf and kill pathogens to
cure disease [36]. In the present study, phagocytic capacity
of goat monocytes was decreased after treatment with
different concentrations of rHCcyst-2 in a dose-dependent
manner.
The cysteine proteases of lysosomes and endosomes
of antigen-presenting cells have been identified to
implicate in the maturation of MHC-II molecule as well
as progression of protein antigens. It has been suggested
that cathepsin S plays an vital role in the series wise
break down of invariant chain of proteolytic enzymes,
that protects the MHC-II molecule from premature
binding of antigen peptide and also involved in regulation
of intracellular trafficking of MHC-II molecule [37].
Meanwhile, cathepsin B and C are essential to promote
antigen peptides binding to the MHC-II peptide binding
groove [38]. A previous study reported that, cystatin
protein from Nippostrongylus brasiliensis in splenocytes
of mice had a negative effect on ovalbumin protein
processing by lysosomal cysteine proteases [15].
Additionally, the presence of cystatin of O. volvulus

for 48 h and incubated with FITC-dextran (1 mg/ml in RPMI1640) for 1 h at 37 °C. The FITC-dextran internalization of cells was analyzed
by flowcytometry and calculated as mean fluorescence intensity (MFI). The data are representative of three independent experiments (*p
< 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001).

caused a significant reduction of human leucocyte antigen
(HLA-DR) on human monocytes by 72 % to that of an
O. volvulus control protein. In the present study, we
demonstrated that rHCcyst-2 decreased the level of MHCII expression on goat monocytes. However, rHCcyst-2
showed no change in expression of MHC-I molecule in a
dose dependent manner.
In conclusion, our results showed that rHCcyst-2
could uptake by goat monocytes and exerts its
immunomodulatory effects on multiple aspects to facilitate
the immune evasion of H. contortus. These findings
provided insight into the interactive relationship between
parasitic nematode cystatins and host monocytes. It also
shed new light on the molecular mechanisms of helminthic
immune evasion. These findings may represent potential
target as immunoregulator, and will be helpful to illustrate
the molecular basis of host–parasite interactions and
search for new potential molecule as vaccine and drug
target candidate.

Cloning of HCcyst-2 and bioinformatics analyses

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Expression and purification of rHCcyst-2 in
Escherichia coli

Utilizing resources from online database, the open
reading frame (ORF) of cystatin-like gene (GenBank
accession number:CDJ82248.1) without signal peptide
sequence was amplified by reverse transcriptionpolymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) using designed
specific pair of primers (forward:5′-TAGAATTCTACAC
AGCAATGCTGGCTG-3′ and reverse: 5′-TACTCGAG
GACCTGCTCATCAGGACCA-3′), in which the EcoRI
and XhoI restriction sites respectively, were introduced
and are shown in italics here. Following ligation of the
obtained RT-PCR product with the pMD19-T vector
(Takara, Dalian, China) to form pMD-cystatin, the
cystatin fragment was cleaved from pMD-cystatin by
EcoRI and XhoI and subcloned into the corresponding
sites of pET32a vector (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA).
The accuracy of the insertion in the resulting plasmid was
confirmed by sequencing.

Ethics statement

The expression of the recombinant fusion protein in
E. coli BL-21 cells (DE3) was induced by Isopropyl-β-Dthiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) at a final concentration of 1
mM for 6 h at 37 °C in Luria-Bertini (LB) medium with
ampicillin (100 μg/ml). The histidine-tagged fusion protein
was purified from the supernatant of bacterial lysates using
the His·Bind®128 Resin Chromatography kit (Novagen)
according to the manufacturer’s instructions, and dialyzed
in phosphate buffered saline (PBS, pH 7.4) to remove
imidazole. The empty pET32a was used for producing
control histidine-tagged protein, which was expressed
and purified identical to the procedure for the cystatinhistidine-tagged fusion protein. The purity of the purified
rHCcyst-2 was analyzed by 12 % sodium dodecyl sulfate
polyacrylamide gelelectrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) followed
by Coomassie blue staining. Protein concentrations were
determined by Bradford method. LPS was depleted from
the rHCcyst-2 using Detoxi-Gel Affinity Pak pre-packed
columns (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA).
The concentrations of the recombinant proteins were
equalized to 1 mg/ml prior to LAL assay. Endotoxin levels
of the protein samples were measured by LAL gel clot
assay using a Pyrosate®Kit (Cape Cod Inc., East Falmouth,
MA, USA). The samples whose endotoxin content was
less than the sensitivity of the Pyrosate kit (<1EU per 1
mg of the recombinant proteins) were collected for the
subsequent experiments.

The experiment was conducted following the
guidelines of the Animal Ethics Committee, Nanjing
Agricultural University, China. All experimental protocols
were approved by the Science and Technology Agency of
Jiangsu Province. The approval ID is SYXK (SU) 20100005.

Parasites and animals
H. contortus strain (designated Nanjing 2005) was
originally obtained from Nanjing (Jiangsu Province,
China) and maintained by serial passage in 3-6 months
old helminths-free goats [39]. Third stage larvae (L3) used
for challenge were cultured from the feces of the monospecifically infected goats at 26 °C and stored in water at
a concentration of 2500 larvae/ml at 4 °C.
Local crossbred male goats (3-6 months old) from
the teaching and research flock at Nanjing Agricultural
University were housed indoors in pens containing six
goats per pen. The male goats were fed hay and whole
shelled corn and provided with water ad libitum. All goats
were dewormed twice at 2 week intervals with levamisole
(8 mg/kg bodyweight) orally at the time of housing to
remove naturally acquired strongyloides infection. After
2 weeks, fecal samples from each goat were examined
by microscope for helminths eggs, according to standard
parasitological techniques. Goats exhibiting no eggs were
used in the subsequent study and daily health observations
were performed throughout the experiment.
SD rats (body weight~150 g) were purchased
from Experimental Animal Center of Jiangsu, PR China
(Qualified Certificate:SCXK 2008-0004) and were raised
in a sterilized room and fed sterilized food and water.

Generation of polyclonal antibodies
The goat antisera used in western blot analyses were
collected from five goats experimentally infected with
H. contortus. The goats were raised in helminths-free
conditions and then orally challenged with 5000 infective

L3. One month later, the goat antisera were collected and
stored at −70°C until use.
To generate polyclonal antibodies against
rHCcyst-2, 0.3 mg of purified rHCcyst-2 was mixed with
Freund's complete adjuvant (1:1) and injected into SD rats
subcutaneously in multiple places, following the method
described by Wang et al. [40]. After the first injection,
rats were then boosted four times at 2-week intervals
with the same dose. The sera containing specific antirHCcyst-2 antibodies were harvested 10 days following
the last injection and the specific reactivity with rHCcyst-2
was checked by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay
(ELISA).

To calculate the inhibitory activity of the
recombinant protein, the concentration of rHCcyst-2
at which a 50 % inhibition of the proteolytic enzymes
activities achieved (IC50) was measured [41].
Recombinant protein was pre-incubated with each
enzyme in an assay buffer for 30 min. Then, 0.25 mM
of the protease-specific substrates was added to each well
and residual enzyme activity monitored. The histidinetagged protein was used as control. Enzymes used were as
follows: human cathepsin L (0.05 μM), human cathepsin B
(0.05 μM), human caspase 1 (0.05 μM) as well as papain
(0.15 μM). All of these enzymes were purchased from
Sigma Company. The assay buffer used consisted of 100
mM sodium acetate, pH 5.5, 100 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA,
1 mg/ml cysteine and 0.005 % TritonX-100. The substrates
purchased (Sigma company) were as follows: Z-Phe-ArgAMC-HCl for papain, cathepsin L and cathepsin B and
Ac-Tyr-Val-Ala-Asp-AFC for caspase 1. Fluorescence
intensity was monitored by SPECTRAFLUOR (TECAN,
Maennedorf, Switzerland) with the wave length pair of
360-460 nm for emission and excitation respectively.

Western blot analysis
Purified rHCcyst-2 (20 μg) was resolved on
12 % SDS-PAGE and transferred to Hybond-C extra
nitrocellulose membranes (Amersham Biosciences, UK).
Non-specific binding sites were blocked by immersing
the membranes in 5 % skim milk in Tris-buffered saline
(TBS) for 1 h at room temperature. The membranes were
then washed 5 times (5 min each) in TBS containing 0.1
% Tween-20 (TBST). Subsequently, the membranes were
incubated with the primary antibodies (antiserum from
goats experimentally infected with H. contortus) for 1 h
at 37°C (dilutions 1:100 in TBST). After being washed
5 times in TBST, the membranes were then incubated
with HRP-conjugated rabbit anti-goat IgG (Sigma, St.
Louis, MO, USA) for 1 h at 37°C (diluted 1:2000 in
TBST). Finally, the immunoreaction was visualized using
freshly prepared diaminobenzidine (DAB, Sigma) as a
chromogenic substrate after 5 min.

Isolation of goat monocytes
Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were
separated from heparinized blood with the standard Ficollhypaque (GE Healthcare, USA) gradient centrifugation
method and washed twice in PBS. Monocytes were
isolated by their adherence to plastic surface [42]. The goat
PBMCs were seeded in a 6 wells flat-bottom tissue culture
plates (Corning, USA) in cell culture medium RPMI 1640
(GIBCO, UK) containing 10 % heat inactivated fetal calf
serum (GIBCO, UK), 100 U/mL penicillin and 100 mg/
mL streptomycin (GIBCO, UK). Plates were incubated at
37 °C in a humidified atmosphere with 5 % CO2 for 1 h
[43]. Non-adherent cells were removed by washing twice
with PBS. The adherent cells were collected and adjusted
to a density of 1×106 cells/mL in cell medium at 37 °C in
a humidified atmosphere with 5 % CO2. Cell viability, as
determined by trypan blue dye exclusion was more than
95 % in all cases.

Localization of HCcyst-2 by
immunohistochemical study
Washed adult worms suspended in PBS were fixed
in 4 % formaldehyde-0.2 % glutaraldehyde in PBS for
90 min and then immersed in TISSUE-TeK® O.C.T.
compound (SAKURA, USA). They were snap frozen
in liquid nitrogen and stored at -20°C until required for
further processing. Cryostat sections of 10 μm thickness
were cut, washed with PBS, and treated for 60 min with
10 % normal goat serum in PBS to prevent non-specific
binding of antibodies. The sections were then incubated
with specific rat anti-rHCcyst-2 antiserum (1:100 dilution)
or normal rat serum (control) for 60 min at 37 °C, washed
15 min × 3 with PBS, and subsequently incubated for
60 min with Cy3 goat anti-rat IgG (ab6953, Abcam,
Cambridge, MA, USA). Finally, the sections were stained
with DAPI (Beyotime, Haimen, Jiangsu, China) to show
DNA. After washing with PBS, the specimens were
immersed in Anti-Fade Fluoromount solution (Beyotime),
which prevents fading of fluorescence during microscopic
examination.

Uptake the rHCcyst-2 by goat monocytes
Freshly isolated goat monocytes were seeded into
24-well plates with rHCcyst-2 (40 μg/ml). The nontreated cells were set as control. After incubation at 37 °C
for 30 min, cells were collected and washed twice with
ice-cold PBS. The IF analyses were performed on 4 %
paraformaldehyde-fixed monocytes (rHCcyst-2 treatment
and control) plated on 0.01 % poly-L-lysine-coated
slides). Then, cells were permeabilized by incubation
for 5 min in 0.5 % TritonX-100 in PBS, and were treated
with a blocking solution (2 % BSA in PBS) for 30 min to
reduce background staining. After sequential incubation

with specific rat anti-rHCcyst-2 antiserum (1:100 dilution)
for 2 h and incubation with Cy3 goat anti-rat IgG (ab6953,
Abcam) for 1 h, DIO and DAPI (Beyotime) were used for
plasma membrane and nucleus staining, respectively for
6 min each. Then, protein localization was determined by
observing the staining patterns with a 100×oil objective
lens on a laser scanning confocal microscope (LSM710,
Zeiss, Jena, Germany). Exposure conditions were applied
uniformly for each color channel. All procedures were
carried out at room temperature. Digital images were
captured using the Zeiss microscope software package
ZEN 2012 (Zeiss).

internalization of cells were analyzed by flowcytometry.
Cells were collected after treated with rHCcyst-2 for 48 h
and incubated with FITC-dextran (1 mg/ml in RPMI1640)
for 1 h at 37°C. Cells added with the same amount of
FITC-dextran and incubated at 4°C for 1 h were used as
the baseline of monocyte phagocytosis. After incubation,
cells were washed extensively to remove excess FITCdextran. The FITC-dextran internalization of cells were
analyzed by flowcytometry (BD Biosciences) using Cell
QuestSoftware and median fluorescence intensity (MFI)
was calculated.

Statistical analysis

Detection of cytokine secretion

Data are expressed as mean ± the standard deviation
of the mean. Statistical analysis for significant differences
was performed using an analysis of variance, the Student’s
t test for parametric samples (GraphPad Prism, USA).

To determine cytokine secretion, goat monocytes
were stimulated with LPS (100 ng/ml) for 72 h in the
presence or absence of rHCcyst-2. The supernatants were
collected and cytokine testing was performed by ELISA.
The levels of TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-10, IL-12p40 and TGF-β1
in supernatants were determined using commercially
available goat ELISA kits (Anoric, Tianjin, China).
The analysis was performed with the data from three
independent experiments.

Analysis of MHC molecule expression

FUNDING

The purified monocytes (0.5×106 cells/ml) were
incubated with different concentrations of rHCcyst-2
or equal volumes of control buffer for 24 h in complete
RPMI 1640 at 37 °C. Cells were then stained with the
monoclonal antibodies to MHC-I (MCA2189A647,
AbDserotec, BioRad Laboratories, CA, USA) and MHCII (MCA2226F, AbDserotec), and analyzed on a FACS
Calibur cytometer (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA,
USA). Results were expressed as the percentage of mean
fluorescence intensity (MFI) of control.

The project supports were provided by the “National
Key Basic Research Program (973 program) of China”

To determine nitric oxide production, goat
monocytes were stimulated with LPS (100 ng/ml) for
48 h in the presence or absence of rHCcyst-2. NO was
measured in the cell supernatants as nitrite using a NO
assay kit (Beyotime) according to the manufacturer’s
protocol. Briefly, a standard curve was prepared with
standard nitrite solutions in DMEM medium. The standard
solutions or cell supernatants were reacted with nitrate
reductase for 30 min in a 96-well plate, and then Griess
reagent I and Griess reagent II were added. After 10 min
incubation at room temperature, the absorbance at 540 nm
was read in a microplate reader (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA,
USA). The samples were assayed in triplicate.
