Abstract
Innovative molecular diagnostics deployed in the clinic
enable new ways to stratify patients into appropriate treatment
regimens. These approaches may resolve a major challenge for
early-phase clinical trials, which is to recruit patients who,
while having failed previous treatments, may nevertheless
respond to molecularly targeted drugs. We report the ﬁndings
of a prospective, single-center study conducted in patients with
diverse refractory cancers who underwent comprehensive genomic proﬁling (CGP; next-generation sequencing, 236 genes).
Of the 500 patients enrolled, 188 (37.6%) received either
matched (N ¼ 122/188, 65%) or unmatched therapy (N ¼
66/188, 35%). The most common reasons that patients were
not evaluable for treatment included insufﬁcient tissue, death,
or hospice transfer. The median number of molecular alterations per patient was ﬁve (range, 1–14); median number of
prior therapies, four. The most common diagnoses were ovar-

ian cancer (18%), breast cancer (16%), sarcoma (13%), and
renal cancer (7%). Of the 339 successfully proﬁled patients,
317 (93.5%) had at least one potentially actionable alteration. By calculating matching scores, based on the number of
drug matches and genomic aberrations per patient, we found
that high scores were independently associated with a greater
frequency of stable disease 6 months/partial/complete remission [22% (high scores) vs. 9% (low scores), P ¼ 0.024], longer
time-to-treatment failure [hazard ratio (HR) ¼ 0.52; 95%
conﬁdence interval (CI) ¼ 0.36–0.74; P ¼ 0.0003], and survival
(HR ¼ 0.65; 95% CI ¼ 0.43–1.0; P ¼ 0.05). Collectively, this
study offers a clinical proof of concept for the utility of CGP
in assigning therapy to patients with refractory malignancies,
especially in those patients with multiple genomic aberrations for whom combination therapies could be implemented.

Introduction

Importantly in this regard, an advancing pipeline of targeted
pharmaceuticals is becoming available to patients with cancer,
and many of these treatments are effective only in the presence
of speciﬁc abnormal signals.
Many patients are referred to phase I centers after having
failed multiple regimens. In part, because of the advanced
nature of the disease, as well as the emergence of resistant
clones of tumor cells, the response rates in traditional phase I
trials are on the order of 5%–10% (1, 2). Recent advances
demonstrate that, by obtaining a genomic "portrait" of the
patient's cancer, and matching patients whose tumors harbor
speciﬁc aberrations with cognate-targeted therapies, higher
response rates can be achieved in the heavily pretreated patient
with advanced cancer (3–5). Indeed, progression-free survival
(PFS) on matched phase I therapy may be better than on prior
lines of conventional, approved unmatched therapy (3, 6), and,
in some cases, responses may be so signiﬁcant that the drug is
afforded breakthrough status, a designation that is associated
with expedited review and approval by the FDA. Remarkably, in
2014, because of high response rates, the FDA-approved ceritinib, an ALK inhibitor, for patients with lung cancer and ALK
aberrations, after phase I testing (4, 7).
The purpose of the current study was to prospectively investigate the clinical utility of a broad, hybrid capture–based nextgeneration sequencing (NGS) assay in the phase I oncology
ecosystem, including determining the feasibility of performing

Comprehensive descriptions of genomic and other molecular alterations that deﬁne individual tumors are now possible.
Investigations to better determine the role of molecular diagnostics in helping clinical oncologists interrogate and prosecute
cancer on a patient-by-patient basis are therefore required.

Cancer Therapy Directed by Comprehensive Genomic Proﬁling

a comprehensive genomic proﬁle (CGP) on the routine biopsy
specimens of patients, as well as describing outcome parameters. Outcome variables included rate of stable disease (SD)
6 months/partial/complete remission (SD 6 months/PR/
CR), time-to-treatment failure (TTF), overall survival (OS), as
well as TTF on trial compared (TTF2) with the TTF of the
immediately prior therapy (TTF1) uninformed by genomics
(TTF2 vs. TTF1). In addition, because patients often have
multiple genomic alterations and receive combination drug
regimens (8), all of which could inﬂuence outcome, we also
investigated a novel, exploratory Matching Score that incorporated the number of matched agents given to a patient and the
number of gene alterations present in the tumor of that
individual.

Patients and Methods
Patient population and study design
Patients with advanced malignancies (N ¼ 500) were eligible to
enroll in this single-arm, nonrandomized study. Tissue analysis
could be done on archived tissue or fresh biopsies. Eligibility
criteria included Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG)
performance status 1 (9), tissue available for molecular testing, a
life expectancy of at least 3 months, and likely suitable to meet the
additional enrollment criteria speciﬁed in therapy protocols. The
study was designed as a navigation trial, where the physician
could use the CGP diagnostic, in the context of the patient's other
medical conditions and laboratory tests, to choose a therapy, such
as a clinical trial within the phase I program. The preplanned study
objectives were to determine the effect of CGP-based matching on
response rate, as well as other outcome parameters, and to assess
the feasibility of CGP in the clinical setting.
The hypothesis was that CGP-based matching would be feasible in a signiﬁcant subset of patients, and that CGP-matched
patients would do better than unmatched patients. The study was
planned for 500 patients enrolled. Because of the advanced nature
of the disease in the population assessed (associated with frequent, rapid decline in patient health), as well as the fact that
diverse cancers were included, it was assumed that only a fraction
of the patients would be treated, and there were thus no early
stopping rules. The study was not blinded; however, the degree of
matching between the aberrations present in the tumor and the
treatment chosen was evaluated at the end of the trial by a reviewer
blinded at the time of review to patient outcome. Information
about the molecular panel, targets, drugs, deﬁnition of matching
(direct and indirect), prognostic scores, the Matching Score,
outcome parameters assessed, and methods of analysis/statistics
are described, in detail, below and in Fig. 1 and Supplementary
Tables S1–S4; refs. 10–51). This study (NCT02437617) was
approved by the MD Anderson Internal Review Board, and all
patients gave informed consent.
Prognostic scoring system
Patients were assessed for prognostic features by previously
described prognostic classiﬁcations [the Royal Marsden Hospital
(RMH) and the MD Anderson Cancer Center (MDACC) scoring
system] that include the following factors: lactate dehydrogenase
(LDH) and albumin levels and number of sites of metastases
(RMH score; refs. 46, 49); RMH variables plus ECOG performance
status, and whether or not patients had gastrointestinal tumors are
part of the MDACC score (42).

CGP using a broad, hybrid capture–based next-generation
sequencing assay
Genomic alterations detected include base substitutions, insertions, deletions, copy number alterations, and selected gene
fusions (Foundation Medicine; Clinical Laboratory Improvements Amendment laboratory; ref. 48; see details in Supplementary Methods and Supplementary Table S1).
Standard biomarker assessments
Patients were assessed for other biomarkers as per standard of
care. For example, patients with breast cancer had assessments for
estrogen and progesterone receptors, as well as Her2 by IHC.
Analysis of data
Targets. The CGP panel was evaluated in the context of standard
of care. Therefore, a target could be a functionally active protein
(e.g., mutated or ampliﬁed BRAF product detected by CGP,
when targeted by a BRAF inhibitor), or a protein preferentially
expressed on tumor versus normal cells [estrogen receptor (ER)
targeted by a hormone modulator].
Matching. A drug was considered "matched" if the half maximal
inhibitory concentration (IC50) impacted the target at low nanomolar range (for small-molecule inhibitors) or if the target was the
primary one recognized by an antibody. We also performed
exploratory analyses that subdivided "matched" therapy into
"matched-direct" and "matched indirect" treatment (see below
and Supplementary Table S2). For actual match designations, and
additional information about the matching process, see Supplementary Table S3 (10–45).
Local rather than systemic therapy and transplant were considered inevaluable for matching. Matching designation was
conﬁrmed by one of the investigators (R. Kurzrock), who was
blinded at the time of designation to patient outcome.
Deﬁnition (matched-direct vs. matched-indirect therapy). Only
drugs that directly impacted the target were considered
matched-direct (Supplementary Table S2). Matched-direct therapy would include small-molecule inhibitors with an IC50 
100 nmol for the target, as well as antibodies whose primary
target was the aberrant protein or a differentially expressed
protein (see also Supplementary Methods).
Matching Score
It is now well known that advanced tumors have multiple
aberrations and that combination therapy is likely to be better
than monotherapy (8). Therefore, an exploratory scoring system ("Matching Score") was developed that divided the number of matched drugs by the number of aberrations. Under this
system, the higher the Matching Score, the better the match. The
score for each match (direct or indirect) was assigned a 1; no
match was a zero. If a drug directly impacted two targets present
in the patient, a 2 was given (example, a multikinase inhibitor
with potent activity against more than one target present in a
tumor); if two drugs each impacted a target directly in a patient,
a 2 was also given. If two drugs were given that impacted
directly (or indirectly) the same target in a patient, the number
2 was still given. If a patient had two mutations in the same
gene, it counted as one aberration. The Matching Score was
calculated by dividing the number derived from the direct and
indirect matches in each patient (numerator) by the number of

aberrations (denominator). For instance, if a patient harboring
six genomic aberrations received two drugs, one of which
matched an aberration directly and the other matched indirectly, the Matching Score would be 2/6 or 0.33. The Matching
Score was also examined, in a subanalysis, wherein "matched
direct" was given 1 point and "matched indirect" was given
either 0.5 or 0.75 points. In addition, high and low Matching
Score was constructed (dichotomized at the median) to examine its effect on treatment outcomes.
Outcome assessment
Patients who were lost to follow up or came off early (before
restaging) for insurance reasons were considered inevaluable
for SD 6 months/PR/CR; patients who came off early for toxicity were considered progressors. Patients who had not been
restaged at the date of data cutoff [six months after the date of
the last enrollment (August 4, 2014)] were considered inevaluable for SD 6 months/PR/CR. SD, PR, or CR was determined
as per the assessment by the treating physician.
TTF and OS were assessed by the method of Kaplan and
Meier, and the survival function between groups was compared
using a two-sided log-rank test.
TTF was the interval from the initial treatment to documentation of disease progression, death, or removal from study for any
reason (mostly toxicity), whichever occurred ﬁrst. Patients who
had not reached any of those endpoints at the date of data cutoff
(August 4, 2014) were censored on that date. If they had not
reached the endpoints at the time of being lost to follow up, they
were censored at the date of last contact.
OS was measured from the time of study enrollment.
Patients still alive (for OS) at the date of data cutoff, or the
date of last contact for patients lost to follow up, were censored
on that date.
TTF2 (that is TTF on therapy after enrollment) was also compared with TTF1 (last prior therapy before enrollment), hence
using patients as their own control (TTF2/TTF1; ref. 51).
Matched/unmatched was designated on the basis of the ﬁrst
trial after receiving the CGP result, except when patients were
unknowingly placed on a matched therapy at the time of or
after consenting, but before getting the CGP result. Local
therapy (hepatic arterial infusion, for example) and transplant
were considered inevaluable. For local therapy (but not for
transplant), the next therapy after the local therapy was the one
evaluated for TTF2; the therapy before the local was used for
TTF1. Other than this case, TTF2 versus TTF1 referred to the TTF
of therapy on study (TTF2) versus the TTF on prior therapy
(TTF1). All patients who received transplant as their ﬁrst therapy after molecular results were known were considered inevaluable for all outcome parameters. If a patient was knowingly
matched at the time of consent, the next therapy was evaluated
for SD 6 months/PR/CR, TTF, and OS, but the patient was
inevaluable for TTF2 versus TTF1. Patients whose immediate
prior therapy met one of the following criteria were considered
inevaluable for TTF2 versus TTF1: TTF1 not known; therapy was
local therapy (e.g., hepatic arterial infusion), matched therapy,
or transplant. However, they were evaluable for SD 6 months/
PR/CR, TTF, and OS. If the therapy immediately before the onstudy matched or unmatched therapy was immunotherapy,
that patient was inevaluable for all outcome parameters (SD
6 months/PR/CR, TTF, OS, TTF2 vs. TTF1) because of the
potential for delayed responses.

Statistical analysis
Patient characteristics were summarized using descriptive statistics. The c2 test or Fisher exact test, as appropriate, was used to
evaluate the associations between categorical variables and SD 6
months/PR/CR. The Mann–Whitney U-test was applied to compare the number of molecular alterations per person between the
matched and unmatched groups.
The main endpoints of the study were SD 6 months/PR/CR as
well as TTF, OS, and TTF2/TTF1. These endpoints were prospectively decided. No multiplicity correction was made or felt to be
necessary as these are classic endpoints. Multivariable logistic
regression was used to identify predictors of SD 6 months/
PR/CR. Kaplan–Meier estimates were computed for the time-toevent data. Log-rank test was applied for comparing the survival
curves between groups. The multivariable Cox proportional
hazards regression model was used to examine risk factors related
to TTF and OS, after adjusting for other factors (47). Covariates
included in the stepwise multivariate analysis were those with P
value <0.125 in univariate analysis. Only variables with P  0.10
in the multivariate analysis (and matched versus unmatched)
were included in the ﬁnal model. Frailty model applying to the
Cox regression was used to compare the TTF1 (TTF in the previous
treatment) and TTF2 (TTF in the current treatment) by assuming a
random effect on each patient to account for within patient
correlations. All statistical tests were two-sided, and P  0.05 was
considered statistically signiﬁcant. Statistical analyses were carried
out using SPSS (version 22.0; SPSS) and R (version 3.1.2;
R Foundation for Statistical Computing).

Results
Patient characteristics
Of the 500 patients enrolled, 188 (37.6%) were treated on
either matched [N ¼ 122/500 (24.4%); 68% of 188 treated
patients] or unmatched therapy [N ¼ 66/500 (13.2%); 32% of
188 treated patients; Fig. 1]. Ninety-seven percent (182/188) of
treated patients were evaluable for SD 6 months/PR/CR; all 188,
for TTF and OS (Fig. 1); and 74% (140/188) for TTF2 versus TTF1
[that is TTF on therapy after enrollment (TTF2) as compared with
prior TTF (TTF1)]. Of patients who were not evaluable for treatment, the most common reasons were insufﬁcient tissue, death, or
transfer to hospice (Fig. 1).
The median age of treated patients was 59 years (range, 19–82
years). Sixty-six (35%) were men. The median number of molecular alterations per patient was 5 (range, 1–14; Table 1); the
median number of prior therapies was four. The most common
diagnoses were ovarian cancer (18%), breast cancer (16%), sarcoma (13%), and renal cancer (7%). Many patients [123/188
(65%)] received combination regimens. Overall, if matching was
not considered, there was no difference in rates of SD 6 months/
PR/CR between those patients who received combination therapy
versus those that received monotherapy (17% vs. 13%; P ¼ 0.5).
Similarly, there was no difference in TTF or OS in these groups.
Of the 339 patients who had CGP (Supplementary Table S1 for
gene list) successfully performed, 317 (93.5%) had 1 potentially
actionable alteration.
Matching
Of the 122 patients on matched therapy, 110 were matched
on the basis of one or more alterations in their CGP analysis
(Materials and Methods and Supplementary Tables S2 and S3;

on non-CGP biomarkers [ER-positive, N ¼ 10; HER2 ampliﬁcation, N ¼ 1 (HER2-ampliﬁed by FISH, but not by CGP); and,
c-MET positivity by IHC, N ¼ 1]. Of the total number of
matches that occurred, 34 drugs were directed at a CGP biomarker; six, against a non-CGP biomarker.
Matched versus unmatched patients
Patient characteristics in the matched and unmatched cohorts
were generally well balanced as displayed in Table 1. Patients in
the unmatched group, however, had a higher incidence of gastrointestinal malignancy and lower serum albumin (both poor
prognostic factors) than matched patients. On the other hand,
unmatched patients also had a lower incidence of PI3K/Akt/
mTOR pathway abnormalities, fewer TP53 mutations, and fewer
molecular alterations than matched patients (all favorable prognostic factors; Tables 1 and 2). Matched versus unmatched
patients were balanced for both composite prognostic scores—
the RMH score (based on levels of albumin, and LDH, and
number of metastatic sites) and the MDACC scoring system
(based on RMH with tumor type, and ECOG performance status
as additional variables; Table 1; refs. 42, 46, 49).

Direct versus indirect matches
Table 2 shows that patients with direct versus indirect matches
(deﬁned in Supplementary Table S2 and Materials and Methods)
had numerically better TTF and OS, while SD 6 months/PR/CR
was numerically higher in the indirectly matched patients (all
statistically insigniﬁcant).
These results were similar when a second deﬁnition of direct
versus indirect match was used (direct ¼ impact on product of
genomic alteration or one effector removed or aberrantly
expressed protein or well-known functional effect such as PARP
inhibitors in the presence of BRCA mutation; indirect ¼ all other
matches).
Univariate analysis (Table 2 and Fig. 2)
Only lower number of prior therapies and high versus low
Matching Score (number of molecular matches per patient divided by number of molecular alterations per patient, dichotomized
at median; Materials and Methods for complete deﬁnition) were
signiﬁcantly associated with higher rates of SD 6 months/PR/
CR; matched versus unmatched therapy that was dichotomized
rather than given a Matching Score showed a trend towards
association with higher rates of SD 6 months/PR/CR.

TTF, the absence of PI3K pathway aberrations showed a trend
towards association with better TTF.
Fewer metastatic sites, lower number of prior therapies,
better ECOG performance status, higher albumin and lower
LDH levels, absence of PI3K pathway aberrations, and better
RMH or MDACC scores were also signiﬁcantly associated with
better OS; lower platelet counts, fewer number of molecular
alterations, and matched versus unmatched therapy [Fig. 2B; or
high vs. low Matching Score for matching (Fig. 2D)] showed a
trend towards association with better OS. The pattern was
maintained for TTF and OS when a three-tier stratiﬁcation
based on Matching Score was explored, demonstrating the
stepwise improvement in outcomes with increasing Matching
Score (Fig. 2E and F).

Comparison of TTF after enrollment to prior TTF (TTF2 vs.
TTF1)
Patients normally have a shorter TTF with each subsequent line
of systemic therapy. Furthermore, TTF with phase I drugs would
be expected to be shorter than TTF with conventional prior
therapy or non-phase I regimens. Patients in the various categories showed no signiﬁcant differences in prior TTF (TTF1) between
groups [matched versus unmatched; Matching Score high versus
low (or direct versus indirect matches; Supplementary Table S4)],
indicating that these patients were well balanced in their outcomes after last prior therapy. Table 3 shows that patients that
were unmatched or had a low Matching Score had a TTF2 that was
signiﬁcantly shorter than TTF1, as would be expected. In contrast,
there was no shortening of TTF2 vs. TTF1 in patients that were
matched or had a high Matching Score.
Multivariate analysis of factors independently associated
with rate of SD 6 months/PR/CR
Table 4 shows that the factors independently and signiﬁcantly predictive of higher rate of SD 6 months/PR/CR were
less number of prior therapies and a higher Matching Score.
Matched versus unmatched therapy (without scoring) showed
a trend that did not reach statistical signiﬁcance (P ¼ 0.06) for
association with a higher rate of SD 6 months/PR/CR.

albumin <3.5 g/dL (þ1) and number of metastatic sites of disease 2 (0) versus
metastatic sites of disease 3 (þ1; refs. 46, 49).
e
MDACC score included two additional variables to that of RMH score namely,
ECOG performance status <1 (0) versus ECOG performance status 1 (þ1),
and, nongastrointestinal tumor type (0) versus gastrointestinal tumor type
(þ1; ref. 42).

Multivariate analysis of factors independently associated
with TTF
Table 4 demonstrates that only matched versus unmatched
therapy and MDACC score predicted longer TTF (if instead of
MDACC score, its components with P < 0.125 in univariate
analysis were included in the initial multivariate analysis,
lower LDH, lower platelets, fewer prior therapies, and matched
versus unmatched predicted longer TTF). When the scoring
system was used, a higher Matching Score was also independently and signiﬁcantly associated with longer TTF (median ¼
3.4 months vs. 1.9 months; P ¼ 0.0003; Tables 2 and 4).

Only fewer metastatic sites, lower number of prior therapies,
better ECOG performance status, higher albumin levels, lower
LDH levels, lower platelet counts, matched versus unmatched
[Fig. 2A; or high versus low Matching Score (Fig. 2C)] and better
RMH (or MDACC score) were signiﬁcantly associated with longer
TTF (keeping in mind, that number of metastatic sites, albumin,
and LDH are part of both the RMH and MDACC score, and ECOG
performance status is in addition a part of the MDACC score); for

Multivariate analysis of factors independently associated
with OS
Table 4 shows that only absence of PI3K aberrations and better
MDACC score were associated with longer OS; in contrast, when
individual factors were analyzed instead of the MDACC score,
better performance status, lower LDH, higher albumin, absence of
PI3K pathway aberrations, and lower number of molecular alterations were associated with longer OS. Matched versus unmatched
therapy was not associated with OS. When the Matching Score was

used, and the MDACC Score included, the Matching Score showed
a trend toward association with OS (P ¼ 0.1). When the individual
factors were analyzed instead of the MDACC Score, a higher
Matching Score was independently and signiﬁcantly associated
with OS (P ¼ 0.05; Table 4).
Matching Score system for high versus low matching
In multivariate analysis, matched versus unmatched therapy
was independently associated with longer TTF, but showed only a
trend toward association with higher rates of SD 6 months/PR/
CR; there was no association with OS. In contrast, when the
Matching Score was used, a high Matching Score was independently associated with higher proportion of SD 6 months/PR/
CR, longer TTF, and OS (Table 4).
Because there was no signiﬁcant difference in outcomes with
direct versus indirect matches (Table 2), the Matching Score

www.aacrjournals.org

system applied one point for either direct or indirect matches.
However, other alternative scoring systems were also explored (1
point for direct matches and either 0.5 or 0.75 points for indirect
matches). The latter systems produced associations similar to
those of matched versus unmatched therapy or to the Matching
Score (1 point for direct and 1 point for indirect matches),
depending on the outcome parameter examined. Finally, the
analysis was run with the patients matched by non-CGP markers
removed (N ¼ 12, matched by ER or MET IHC or Her2 FISH alone
 four patients matched by CGP as well as a non-CGP marker),
and the main signiﬁcance values were unchanged.

Discussion
We report a prospective investigation of the clinical utility
of CGP (Supplementary Table S1) in matching patients with

targeted drugs. The study design was that of a navigational
trial, wherein the physician could choose therapy based on the
CGP diagnostic, in the context of the patient's comorbidities,
mirroring the situation in practice. Five hundred patients were
enrolled on the trial; 188 (37.6%) were treated [122/500
(24.4%) on matched, and 66/500 (13.2%) on unmatched therapy; Fig. 1]. All treated patients had advanced cancer (median
¼ four prior therapies in the metastatic setting). Matched and
unmatched patients were well balanced for the RMH and
MDACC prognostic scores (Table 1; refs. 42, 46, 49). The main
reasons for failure to be treated include inadequate tissue for
analysis and early death or worsening condition (Fig. 1). These
observations indicate that interrogating patients' tumors with
CGP, and prosecuting the actionable alterations, is feasible in
the refractory setting for a signiﬁcant subgroup of patients. As
a major reason for failure to be treated was death or deterioration due to progressive cancer, increasing the proportion of
treated patients will likely require moving CGP assessment to
an earlier line of therapy.
Importantly, as multi-gene panels have become available, it is
apparent that most patients have numerous alterations (median
¼ ﬁve alterations/patient in our study), indicating that customized combination therapy may be necessary (8, 50). For this
reason, we developed an exploratory Matching Score that divided
the number of matches by the number of molecular anomalies in
each participant's malignancy (Materials and Methods). Notably
our trial showed an independent and signiﬁcant association
(multivariate analysis) between a high Matching Score and a
higher rate of SD 6 months/PR/CR, as well as better TTF and

www.aacrjournals.org

OS (Table 4). Examining only "matched versus unmatched" as a
variable revealed an independent/signiﬁcant association between
matching patients to cognate therapy and TTF, and a trend for
higher rates of SD 6 months/PR/CR, but not OS. Therefore,
understanding and optimizing the impact of matching strategies
may require taking into account the need for and inﬂuence of
matched combination treatments (50), as well as the effect of
genomic complexity (8, 52).
The current trial is one of the ﬁrst prospective studies evaluating genomically driven medicine and using an advanced
CGP platform (N ¼ 236 genes). Several ﬁrst-generation studies,
as well as a randomized trial, have been completed. For example, Von Hoff and colleagues (51) reported 66 patients who
were proﬁled using protein biomarkers; 18 (27%) had a progression-free survival (PFS) ratio of 1.3 (95% CI, 17%–38%;
one-sided, one-sample P ¼ 0.007; PFS ratio referring to PFS on
biomarker-driven therapy versus prior PFS). Our group previously published the data from the PREDICT/IMPACT (observational, nonrandomized, navigational, non-NGS assay) trial,
which showed that of 1,144 patients analyzed, 460 (40.2%)
had one or more genomic alterations (12 single gene aberrations assessed per patient); in multivariate analysis, matched
therapy (N ¼ 175 patients treated) was an independent factor
predicting response and TTF (compared with the 116 patients
treated without matching; ref. 3). In the SHIVA study, patients
with heavily pretreated advanced tumors were randomized to
physician choice versus an algorithm of matched monotherapy,
heavily weighted towards hormone modulators or the mTOR
inhibitor everolimus in patients with hormone receptor or
PI3K/AKT/mTor signal anomalies, respectively, and outcomes
were not improved. (53) Our study differs from one or more of
these other trials in several ways, including the participation of
patients with diverse cancers, the use of NGS and matched
combination drug regimens, taking into consideration the number of alterations per patient, the prospective (albeit nonrandomized) nature of the study, the larger number of patients and
higher percentage (24.4%, N ¼ 122) who received matched
targeted therapy, and the inclusion of results from patients who
received either matched or unmatched treatment. The current
trial strengthens the ﬁndings from the previously published
studies above, other than the negative SHIVA study (53), supporting the feasibility of using molecular proﬁling in the
clinic and the improvement in outcomes noted with genomic
matching, especially when matched combinations rather than
matched monotherapy are used.
Several additional trials that use molecular proﬁling have
been initiated or are planned, including, but not limited to: (i)
WINTher (prospective, nonrandomized, navigation trial), an
international study to select rational therapeutics based on a
CGP platform (NGS, 236 genes; Arm A) and a tumor versus
normal transcriptomics comparison (Arm B; NCT01856296);
(ii) NCI-MATCH, a prospective, nonrandomized trial in diverse
tumors (solid cancers and lymphomas) that will determine
if targeted therapies for people whose tumors have speciﬁc
gene mutations will be effective regardless of their cancer
type (NCT02465060); (iii) LUNG-MAP, a prospective, randomized trial for patients with lung cancer (NCT02154490);
(iv) IMPACT2, a randomized study in diverse, metastatic malignancies (NCT02152254); and (v) TAPUR, a nonrandomized,
prospective trial using commercially available drugs used offlabel, sponsored by the American Society of Clinical Oncology.

There were several limitations to this study. Phase I drugs were
in the treatment regimens, some of which may not have engaged
the target well or had poor pharmacokinetics, and patients at all
dose levels were included in our analysis. Limitations such as
these might attenuate salutary impact on outcome parameters,
even with matching. On the other hand, this was not a randomized study, and there might be unknown biases, unaccounted for
despite the multivariate analysis, that positively inﬂuence outcome. Some patients were administered part or all their treatment
by physicians at home, who designated response, without a
centralized review. However, there is a paucity of evidence for
the contention that centralized review enhances validity. Another
limitation was that this was a navigation trial, and physicians
could choose the therapy for their patients. The choices were not
locked down and preassigned. Therefore, this approach limited
our ability to determine the beneﬁt of matching individual

mutations, as more than one drug could be chosen for any one
aberration, depending on physician preference, patient health,
and agent availability. Even so, the evaluation of the overall
strategy of molecular matching was feasible. Furthermore, this
design mimicked what would happen in practice, by authorizing
physicians to choose the optimal therapy for their patient based
on important factors such as comorbidities and patient inclination, rather than just CGP alone. It also permitted taking into
account the dynamic nature of the ﬁeld with rapid new discoveries. Study analysis was also constrained by the number of
patients that could not be given therapy on study (most frequently
because their condition declined). This was perhaps not unexpected, considering that a refractory population is generally
referred to a phase I clinic. Finally, the precise biologic impact
of some mutations such as those in the PI3K or MET pathway is
still a matter of debate and, in addition, it is possible that NGS

Cancer Therapy Directed by Comprehensive Genomic Proﬁling

based on archival tissue may not fully reﬂect the patient's disease
after chemotherapy or radiation, all of which may have attenuated
beneﬁt rates and merits being addressed in future trials (54).
In conclusion, the current prospective study demonstrated that
deploying CGP to assign therapy is feasible for a subset of patients
with heavily pretreated, metastatic cancer. Early drop out was
mainly due to deterioration or demise from cancer. With the
availability of expanded multi-gene NGS tests and an increasing
number of targeted drugs in the clinic, it has been reported that a
majority of patients (90%) will harbor genomic alterations that
are pharmacologically tractable, often by FDA-approved drugs,
albeit off label (55), a result consistent with our current observation that 93.5% of patients who underwent CGP had at least
one potentially actionable aberration. Increasing the proportion
of patients treated will require moving CGP testing earlier in the
disease and addressing the issues of medication access. Importantly, the median number of molecular alterations in our
patients was ﬁve, and many of our patients received combination
therapies. We therefore developed an exploratory Matching Score
that divided the number of matched drugs per patient by the
number of molecular alterations in their tumor. Notably, in
multivariate analysis, a high versus low Matching Score was
signiﬁcantly and independently associated with higher rates of
SD 6 months/PR/CR and longer TTF and OS (Table 4). Patients
who were unmatched or had a low Matching Score had a TTF on
protocol that was signiﬁcantly shorter than their last prior TTF
(Table 3), as would be expected with progressive lines of therapy
and administration of agents in the phase I setting; however, there
was no shortening of TTF on trial versus last prior TTF in patients
that were matched or had a high Matching Score. Utility of this
Matching Score will require further prospective investigations.
Taken together, these observations indicate that CGP can provide
information that is useful in the selection of treatment for patients
with cancer, and that tailored combinations of cognate therapies
may be needed to optimize beneﬁt.
