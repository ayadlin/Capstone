ABSTRACT
The goal of adjuvant (post-surgery) radiation therapy (RT) for breast cancer
(BC) is to eliminate residual cancer cells, leading to better local tumor control and
thus improving patient survival. However, radioresistance increases the risk of
tumor recurrence and negatively affects survival. Recent evidence shows that breast
cancer stem cells (BCSCs) are radiation-resistant and that relatively differentiated
BC cells can be reprogrammed into induced BCSCs (iBCSCs) via radiation-induced
re-expression of the stemness genes. Here we show that in irradiation (IR)-treated
mice bearing syngeneic mammary tumors, IR-induced stemness correlated with
increased spontaneous lung metastasis (51.7%). However, IR-induced stemness was
blocked by targeting the NF-κB- stemness gene pathway with disulfiram (DSF)and
Copper (Cu2+). DSF is an inhibitor of aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) and an FDAapproved drug for treating alcoholism. DSF binds to Cu2+ to form DSF-Cu complexes
(DSF/Cu), which act as a potent apoptosis inducer and an effective proteasome
inhibitor, which, in turn, inhibits NF-κB activation. Treatment of mice with RT and
DSF significantly inhibited mammary primary tumor growth (79.4%) and spontaneous
lung metastasis (89.6%) compared to vehicle treated mice. This anti-tumor efficacy
was associated with decreased stem cell properties (or stemness) in tumors. We
expect that these results will spark clinical investigation of RT and DSF as a novel
combinatorial treatment for breast cancer.

shown that BCSCs are radioresistant[4, 5]; but radiation
also can induce BCSCs, i.e., iBCSCs from nonstem breast
cancer cells [6]. In order to significantly improve the
efficacy and curability of RT for breast cancer, therefore,
novel therapeutic approaches are urgently needed to not
only eliminate radioresisitant pre-existing BCSCs, but
also block the formation of radiation induced new BCSCs
from nonstem BC cells. This study is a pre-clinical effort
to develop such a new treatment, for rapid translation into
clinical practice, that is scientific sound, simple, safe and
economic.
Following the first discovery that mature adult
cells can be reprogrammed to become pluripotent stem
cells (iPSCs) by introduction of a set of four stemness
factors (Oct4, SOX2, KLF4 and MYC) through retroviral
transduction [7], it has been shown that cancer stem
cells (CSCs) and relatively differentiated cancer cells
are subject to bidirectional conversion [8]. Stemness
gene-encoded transcription factors (TFs) play a central
role in the determination of stem cell states [7], with
specific transcriptional networks having essential roles
in sustaining the growth and self-renewal of embryonic
and neoplastic stem-like cells. The TFs Slug and SOX9
cooperatively determine mammary stem cell states in
both normal and malignant cells [9]. Moreover, the
overexpression in human cancers of reprogramming TFs
correlates with tumor progression and poor prognosis [10].
IR has been shown to reprogram differentiated cancer cells
into iBCSCs or liver CSCs through the re-expression or
upexpression of the stemness genes Oct4/SOX2/Nanog/
KLF4 and SOX2/OCT3/Oct4, respectively [6, 11].
There is compelling evidence showing that the
cells expressing elevated levels of intracellular aldehyde
dehydrogenase 1 (ALDH1) in human and mouse breast
cancer are BCSCs [12, 13]. The ability of enhanced
ALDH1 activity in these cells to eliminate genotoxic
aldehydes contributes to their radio- and chemoresistance. Research on the CSC area has been facilitated
by the ability to routinely detect and isolate CSCs by
flow cytometry analysis using the ALDEFLUOR reagent
to measure their ALDH enzymatic activity [6, 14].
Consequently, ALDH activity is widely used as a CSC
marker for many malignancies including leukemia, lung,
liver, bone, colon, pancreatic, prostate, head and neck,
bladder, thyroid, brain, and cervical cancer and melanoma
[15]. Moreover, we demonstrated that ALDH1A1 is not
only a marker but also a therapeutic target for CSCs [14,
16, 17].
DSF (Brand name: Antabuse) is an irreversible
pan-ALDH inhibitor; it inhibits all the currently
identified cytosolic and mitochondrial ALDH isoforms
[18, 19], resulting in accumulation of, in particular,
acetaldehyde, which causes unpleasant effects when
alcohol is consumed. As a result, DSF has been an FDA
approved drug for treatment of alcoholism since 1951
[20]. Studies have shown that in cells DSF converts to
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

diethyldithiocarbamate (deDTC) and that two molecules
of deDTC bind to one molecule of copper (Cu2+) to form
the Cu[deDTC]2 complex (DSF/Cu) [21-23]. Cu2+ is an
essential trace element for life [24] as it plays a crucial
role in redox reactions and generation of reactive oxygen
species (ROS) in human cells [25, 26]. It is known that
DSF/Cu is an effective proteasome inhibitor resulting
in inhibition of NF-κB [21, 27]. NF-κB is a key TF
governing the activation of many genes involved in stress
responses (e.g. IR), cell survival, apoptosis, inflammation,
and radioresistance [28]. These NF-κB regulated stemness
genes include ERBB2 [4], SOX9 [29], MYC [30] and
WNT [31]. We have, therefore, investigated using human
and mouse BC cell lines and a clinically relevant mouse
model whether DSF/Cu can block in vitro and in vivo the
IR-induced conversion of nonstem BC cells into iBCSCs
via downregulation of the NF-κB-stemness gene pathway
and enhance the efficacy of RT.

RESULTS
DSF/Cu effectively depleted pre-existing BCSCs
and radiation-induced BCSCs
Based on compelling evidence showing that
elevated ALDH activity in human and mouse BC cells is
a marker for BCSCs and iBCSCs [6, 12-14], in this study
we have identified these cells by flow cytometry analysis
of BC cells as ALDHbright cells, namely those ALDH+ cells
with twice the mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) of the
bulk ALDH+ cell population. We detected an increased
percentage of BCSCs in vitro following fractionated
irradiation (3.75 Gray (Gy) /day x 5 days) of BC cell lines
MDA-MB-231 (2.4 fold), SUM149 (1.4 fold) and UACC812 (4.6 fold) (Supplementary Fig. S1A). Within a range
of doses of fractionated irradiation (1-5 Gy/day x 5 days),
increased ALDHbright cells were detected in BC cell lines
(Supplementary Fig. S1B). The increased percentage of
BCSCs was caused by an increase in the absolute number
of BCSCs accompanied by a 50.5% decrease in total
cell number in irradiated cells vs. untreated cells, which
indicates that IR induced the formation of new BCSCs or
iBCSCs (Fig. 1A). The stem cell functional properties of
these BCSCs and iBCSCs were further supported by in
vitro formation of mammospheres (Fig. 1B) and increased
tumorigenicity of the in vitro irradiated BC cells compared
to untreated BC cells in mice (Fig. 1C). Treatment of cells
with DSF/Cu effectively depleted pre-existing (before
IR) BCSCs and iBCSCs (together referred to as BCSCs/
iBCSCs) (Fig. 1A, B, C), including those induced by IR
from nonstem ALDHneg cells, as evidenced using this cells
isolated by fluorescence-activated cell sorting in vitro
(Fig. 1D). In contrast, DSF/Cu or IR and DSF/Cu did not
exhibit toxicity on normal human mammary epithelial

induction of apoptosis and/or 2) obstruction of conversion
of nonstem BC cells into iBCSCs. It is known that DSF/
Cu is a potent inducer of apoptosis of BC cells through,
at least partially, upregulation of the pro-apoptotic ROSmitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) pathway [27].
We found evidence consistent with this, as p38 MAPK
was upregulated and additionally, we found activation of
the pro-survival AKT was inhibited in human BC UACC812 cells treated with a combination of IR and DSF/Cu.

The combination of in vitro treatment with IR
and DSF/Cu induced more potent apoptosis of BC
cells than either single treatment alone
We reasoned that the depletion of BCSCs/iBCSCs by
DSF/Cu could be due to a combination of mechanisms: 1)

injected subcutaneously (s.c.) into the right hind leg of 28 mice. On day 7, when the tumors reached 5 mm in diameter, mice were assigned
in a stratified randomized manner to 4 groups (n=7 per group) and the treatments were initiated. Group 1 (Vehicle control) was treated

of NF-κB in determining stem cell fates of irradiated BC
cells has never been investigated. Using two human and
one mouse BC cell lines, we detected significant increases
in vitro of stemness gene expression of ERBB2, SOX9,
and MYC at the mRNA and protein levels in irradiated
cells (Fig. 2A, B and Supplementary Table S2). In vitro
treatment of irradiated cells with DSF/Cu reduced the
expression of these stemness genes at the mRNA as well
as protein levels (Fig. 2A, B and Supplementary Table S2).
Additionally, we showed that the inhibitory effect of DSF/
Cu on stemness gene expression was NF-κB dependent, as
treatment with either the NF-κB inhibitor(NF-κBi) IMD0354 or siRNA knockdown of NF-κB (p65) expression
displayed similar stemness inhibition as measured by
gene expression and mammosphere formation (Fig. 2AC). In contrast, treatment with the ROS inhibitor (ROSi)
N-Acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) did not. ROS did not seem
to play a role in modulating the NF-κB- stemness gene
pathway, since the ROS inhibitor did not impact the ability
of either DSF/Cu, IMD-0354 or the NF-κB p65 siRNA to
inhibit the expression of stemness genes (Fig. 2A, B).

DSF/Cu blocked the IR-induced stemness via
downregulation of the NF-κB-stemness gene
pathway in vitro
As DSF/Cu has been shown to be an effective
proteasome inhibitor, that can result in inhibition of NFκB activity [21, 27]. We determined that DSF/Cu was able
to markedly inhibit IR-induced upregulation of NF-κB
(Supplementary Fig. S3). Studies have also shown that
NF-κB plays a major role in regulating the expression of
the stemness genes ERBB2 [4], SOX9 [29], MYC [30],
and WNT [31]. In this regard, we found potential NF-κB
binding sites in the promoter regions of WNT3 for human
and mouse (Supplementary Table S1). However, the role

DSF blocked IR-induced stemness in vivo resulting
in inhibition of both primary tumor growth and
spontaneous lung metastasis
To determine the impact of IR on stemness
in primary breast tumors, and whether DSF/Cu can
counteract IR-induced stemness in vivo, we used the 4T1
cell line-derived syngeneic BALB/c mouse tumor model,
which closely resembles human breast cancer and forms
spontaneous lung metastases [32]. Consistent with our in
vitro findings (Fig. 2A, B), IR increased stemness genes
ERBB2, SOX9, and MYC and WNT3 mRNA (1.21-4.52
fold) and protein expression (Fig. 3B-D, Supplementary
Table S3). Additionally, the number of mammospheres
formed from tumors obtained from IR-treated mice was
higher than the number obtained from tumors of mice
treated with vehicle, as measured using tumors obtained
from these groups of mice one day after the treatment was
completed (day 15) and at the end of the experiment (day
29). The increase at day 15 was 61.0%, and at day 29, it
was 84.2% (Fig. 3E, F). Although IR yielded a modest
reduction in primary tumor volume compared to the
vehicle control (20.1%) (Fig. 3A), strikingly, the high level
of IR-induced stemness correlated with a 51.7% greater
nodular area of spontaneous lung metastases compared
to the vehicle control (Fig. 4A). However, we found that
the combination of IR and DSF was significantly more
effective at suppressing primary tumor growth compared
to IR alone (74.2%), DSF alone (71.1%) or vehicle (79.4%
) treated mice on day 29 (Fig. 3A). It should be noted that
in contrast to in vitro experiments, that because a high
level of endogenous Cu2+ exists in tumor environments,
exogenous Cu2+ was not needed in these in vivo-based

in a syngeneic mouse model system. This surprising
and provocative finding was confirmed repeatedly in in
vivo experiments using the same mouse model (Fig. 4A,
B and data not shown). The significant increase in lung
metastasis in IR treated mice compared to vehicle treated
mice is likely attributed to IR-induced stemness (Fig. 3BF). Nevertheless, it is noteworthy that the inhibition of
primary tumor growth may also be a contributing factor
to significant decrease in lung metastasis in IR and DSF
treated mice compared to those treated with either IR or
DSF alone (Fig. 3A, Fig. 4A). When comparing IR and
DSF with DSF alone, it was shown that the products of the
four stemness genes at the mRNA level in day 15 tumors
were comparable in both groups but markedly reduced
compared to those detected in tumors of mice treated
with IR. However, in day 29 tumors, mRNA expression
of c-myc and WNT3 were reduced in both groups of mice
relative to the IR group, but ERBB2 and SOX9 mRNA
levels were significantly reduced only in the tumors of
mice treated with IR and DSF (Fig.3B, C). Of the four
stemness gene products analyzed in day 15 and 29 tumors
at the protein level, the expression of SOX-9 and c-myc,
but not ERBB2 and WNT3, was significantly lower in
the mice treated with the IR and DSF than DSF alone.
Furthermore, the number of mammospheres of tumors
treated with IR and DSF, however, was significantly lower
than that of tumors treated with DSF alone (Fig. 3E, F).
Therefore, it seems that SOX9 and c-myc might play more
dominant roles than ERBB2 and WNT3 in determining
tumor stemness in this tumor model.
Through investigation of the mechanism underling
the inhibition of stemness gene expression, we found
that DSF/Cu and NF-κB inhibitors, which both result in
a blockade of NF-κB signaling, prevented the formation
of iBCSCs. The downregulation of NF-κB signaling by
DSF/Cu or the NF-κB inhibitor or NF-κB p65 siRNA
knockdown significantly blocked IR-induced expression
of stemness genes ERBB2, SOX9, MYC and WNT3 (Fig.
2A, B). As a result of these events, markedly decreased
or depleted BCSCs/iBCSCs were detected using in vitro
and in vivo-based assays, namely ALDH activity as a
marker (Fig. 1A), mammosphere formation (Fig. 1B, D,
Fig. 2C ), tumorigenicity in vivo (Fig. 1C) , mammosphere
formation of digested primary tumor cells (Fig. 3E, F) and
spontaneous lung metastasis (Fig. 4A). The information
from our study contributes to our understanding of the
bidirectional conversion between iBCSCs and nonstem
BC cells and introduces the novel concept of blocking
the formation of iBCSCs as a result of IR. Although we
focused only on the NF-κB- stemness gene pathway
involving stemness genes ERBB2, SOX9, and MYC and
WNT3 in our present study, we suspect other stemness
genes or pathways may be involved as well in the process
of IR-induced stemness [6, 11]. It will be well worth
pursuing studies on this aspect of the BCSCs/iBCSCs
challenge to RT.

experiments for DSF efficacy [21, 33]. The higher
potency anti-tumor effect of the combinatorial therapy
of the mice was associated with a marked reduction of
stemness gene expression and mammosphere formation
in primary tumors compared to that of mice treated with
either IR or DSF alone or vehicle (Fig. 3B-F). On day
15, the combination of IR and DSF already resulted in a
reduction of stemness mRNA expression (4.13-6.25 fold)
and mammospheres (87.2%) compared to tumors treated
with IR alone (Fig. 3B, D, E, Supplementary Table S3).
This effect was sustained until day 29, when the tumor
diameter of control mice reached the upper allowable
limit of 1.5 cm (Fig. 3C, D, F, Supplementary Table S3).
The decreased expression of stemness genes (1.92-5.25
fold) was directly related to the functional properties of
BCSCs, as noted by the markedly reduced ability of the
treated tumor cells to form mammospheres (87.2%) (Fig.
3C, D, F, Supplementary Table S3). Relative to mice
treated with vehicle, DSF-treated non-irradiated mice
also exhibited a reduction of stemness gene expression
(1.88-6.24 fold on day 15; 0-2.73 fold on day 29) and
decreased mammosphere formation (60.2% on day 15;
64.8% on day 29) (Fig. 3B-F and Supplementary Table
S3). Clearly, the combination of IR and DSF eliminated
the majority of BCSCs/iBCSCs in vivo. Consequently, the
size of spontaneous lung metastatic nodules was reduced
89.6% in DSF-treated irradiated mice and 20.4% in DSF
treated non-irradiated mice, compared to mice treated with
vehicle (Fig. 4A). In sharp contrast, as previously noted,
there was a 51.7% increase in the size of spontaneous lung
metastatic nodules in irradiated mice compared to mice
treated with vehicle (Fig. 4A). Toxicity was not observed
in the mice enrolled in this study using body weight as an
indicator of drug-induced toxicity (Fig. 4B) [34].

DISCUSSION
RT uses high-energy radiation to kill cancer cells
and shrink tumors and is one of the major treatments for
breast cancer and other types of cancer with curative or
palliative intent [35]. However, radioresistant pre-existing
BCSCs, and as our paper describes, the presence of
radiation-induced BCSCs are challenging for a beneficial
outcome of RT as BCSCs are the root of cancer initiation,
progression, and metastasis [36, 37]. In an effort to
significantly improve the efficacy of RT for breast cancer,
we investigated and identified a way to target radioresistant
pre-existing BCSCs and block the formation of radiation
induced BCSCs with DSF/Cu. Our study shown here not
only confirmed independently the finding of radiation
induces BCSCs, first reported by F Pajonk’s group [6], but
also identified the role of the NF-κB-mediated stemness
gene pathway in the generation of IR-induced stem cells
from nonstem BC cells. In addition, we found that IR had
only a modest effect on controlling primary tumor growth
at the same time promoting spontaneous lung metastasis

RT plays a significant role in the management of
early stage, locoregionally advanced, and metastatic breast
cancer [38]. The combinatorial approach of RT with DSF/
Cu, in which Cu2+ is endogenously present in tumors, we
have described here provides a means to not only induce
apoptosis of radioresistant pre-existing BCSCs, but also
prevent the conversion of nonstem BC cells into radiationinduced BCSCs. It is worth noting that although addition
of Cu2+ to DSF is definitely needed for in vitro depletion
of BCSCs/iBCSCs (Fig. 1A, B, D) [27], exogenous copper
should not be administered in conjunction with clinical use
of DSF given the fact that many tumors including breast
cancer tissues contain high levels of copper compared
to normal tissues [39-44] and the beneficial effect of
the copper depleting agent tetrathiomolybdate (TM) on
reducing relapse in breast cancer patients[45]. Indeed, our
in vivo data confirmed that exogenous copper gluconate
administered orally (1mg/kg /day) with DSF(50 mg/kg/
day) and IR (20Gy, once) was significantly less effective
than DSF and IR without copper gluconate in inhibiting
primary tumor growth and lung metastasis in the 4T1
mouse model system (data not shown). Therefore, one
should be cautious on designing a clinical trial for cancer
treatment using DSF and copper together.
In summary, our study offers a solid foundation
for an immediate and practicable strategy of increasing
the efficacy and curability of radiation therapy for breast
cancer patients using a long established, safe and low
cost drug DSF. Moreover, our study i) introduces the
novel concept of blocking iBCSCs through targeting the
NF-κB-stemness gene pathway, ii) reports the finding
that IR, delivered locally to the primary mammary
tumors, promotes distant lung metastasis in mice, and iii)
contributes to a paradigm shift in understanding of the
importance of targeting CSCs and blocking the formation
of radiation induced CSCs in RT of cancers, and therefore
leading to the next generation of radiotherapy.

Flow cytometry and cell sorting

the X-tremeGENE siRNA Transfection Reagent (Roche)
following the manufacturer’s instructions. SignalSilence
Control siRNA (#6201; Cell Signaling technology) was
used as a control. Cells were then incubated for 48 hours
before initiating specified treatments.

Cells were collected and were then incubated with
ALDEFLUOR® reagent (Stem Cell Technologies), with
or without the ALDH inhibitor DEAB according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. ALDHneg cells were sorted
using a BD Biosciences FACSAria II cell sorter.

Western blotting analysis

Irradiation (IR)

Cells were plated in 6-well plates at a density of
2x105 cells/ well in 2 mL of complete medium and were
treated as indicated. Cells were collected and lysed in
lysis buffer (10 mM Tris–HCl (pH 8.2), 1% NP40, 1
mM EDTA, 0.1% BSA, 150 mM NaCl) containing 1/50
(vol/vol) of a protease inhibitor cocktail (Calbiochem),
or proteins were extracted from frozen mouse tumors by
homogenization in the presence of 1 mL of lysis buffer.
Western blotting for signaling-related proteins and proteins
of stemness genes was carried out as described [46]. The
investigators who analyzed the samples from the tumors
were blinded to the type of treatment received by the mice.

In vitro fractionated IR was performed on cells
plated in 6-well plates at a density of 2x105 cells/ well
in 2 mL of complete medium at 3.75Gy daily for 5 days
unless otherwise specified. In vitro a single dose of IR was
performed on cells plated in 6-well plates at a density of
2x105 cells/ well in 2 mL of complete medium at 10Gy. In
vivo, a single dose of 20Gy was delivered locally to each
mouse tumor. The Mark I Model 30 Cesium Irradiator (JL
Shepherd and Associates) was used for all IR experiments
in this study.

Cell proliferation and MTT assay

Mammosphere formation

Cells were plated in triplicate in 96-well plates at
a density of 2.5x103 cells/ well in 100 uL of complete
medium and were treated as indicated. Cell proliferation
was evaluated by an MTT assay at the indicated time
point. MTT assays were carried out as described [46].

Cells were plated in 6-well plates at a density
of 2x105 cells/ well in 2 mL of complete medium and
received fractionated irradiation. Twenty-four hours after
irradiation, cells were treated with DSF/Cu (2.5 µM/1 µM)
or 1 µM NF-κB inhibitor IMD0354 for an additional 24
hours. Mammosphere formation was performed by seeding
the cells (1000 cells/ well) in a 24-well ultra-low adherent
plate (Corning Incorporated) in 500 μL of mixed medium
containing 32% MethoCult medium, 20% MammoCult
basal human medium with a final concentration of 2%
MammoCult proliferation supplements (STEMCELL
Technologies), and 48% DMEM supplemented with final
concentrations of 100 pg/mL EGF, 50 ng/mL bFGF, 5 ng/
mL stem cell factor, 1x10-6 M hydrocortisone, and 5 μg/mL
insulin. The cells were cultured at 37°C in a 5% O2 and 5%
CO2 humidified atmosphere for 14 days. Mammosphere
pictures were taken using a Zeiss Inverted Fluorescence
Microscope on day 10 or 14. Numbers of mammosphere
were count on day 14. Mammosphere formation was also
performed by seeding (1000 cells/ well) in a 24-well ultralow adherent plate of the Fluorescence Activated Cell
Sorting (FACS) sorted ALDHneg cells or cells from a single
cell suspension collected from a disaggregated tumor.

Real-Time qRT-PCR
Cells were plated in 6-well plates at a density
of 2x105 cells/ well in 2 mL of complete medium and
were treated as indicated. Total RNA from all in vitro
experimental samples or frozen mouse tumors was
isolated using TRIzol (Life Technologies), and was
reverse transcribed using M-MLV reverse transcriptase
(Life Technologies) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. All samples within each experiment were
reverse transcribed at the same time. The resulting cDNA
was diluted to a concentration of 100 ng/mL in nucleasefree water and was stored in aliquots at –20°C until use.
Real-time qPCR using cDNA as a template with SYBR
green detection was performed using a LightCycler 96
system (Roche) with FastStart SYBR Green Master
Mix (Roche) and primers for each gene as shown in
Supplementary Table S4. Appropriate no-RT and nontemplate controls were included in each 96-well PCR
reaction, and dissociation analysis was performed at the
end of each run to confirm the specificity of the reaction.
Each gene expression level was normalized to mRNA
levels of the housekeeping gene r18S. Fold changes
of each gene’s expression was compared to that of the
untreated sample using the 2(-Delta Delta C(T)) method

Transfection with siRNA
MDA-MB-231 and SUM149 cells were plated in
12-well plates at a density of 4x104 cells/ well and 3.2x104
cells/ well in 0.5mL of complete medium, respectively.
Cells were transfected with 100 nmol Signalsilence NFκB p65 siRNA (#6261; Cell signaling Technology) using

was given by an oral gavage using an 18 gauge plastic
feeding tube (Solomon Scientific). When tumor diameters
from untreated mice reached 1.5 cm, all mice were
sacrificed. Primary tumors and lungs were collected for
further analysis.

Dual-Glo luciferase assay
MDA-MB-231 cells were plated in 12-well plates
at a density of 4x104 cells/ well in 0.5 mL of complete
medium and cultured for 24 hours, the pGL4.32[luc2P/
NF-κB-RE/Hygro] and pRL-SV40 vectors were cotransfected into adherent cells. After 24 hours, the
transfected cells were irradiated with a single dose of 10
Gy and were then treated with DSF/Cu (2.5 µM/1 µM)
or 1 µM IMD-0354 for 24 hours. A dual luciferase assay
was then performed with these cells using the DualGlo luciferase assay kit according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. NF-κB luciferase activity, normalized to
Renilla luciferase activity, was expressed relative to that
of the untreated cells, which was set at 1.0.

Samples preparations from primary mouse
tumors
For mammosphere formation assay: a non-necrotic
primary tumor tissue specimen from each mouse was
collected at the time of sacrifice, minced into 3x3 mm
pieces and digested with Collagenase IV (1mg/mL PBS)
(Worthington Biochemical Corp.) at 37°C for 1 hour.
A single cell suspension was obtained by filtering the
digested tumor through a 40μM cell strainer.
For total RNA and protein extractions: a nonnecrotic primary tumor tissue specimen from each mouse
was collected at the time of sacrifice, minced (3x3 mm)
and stored at -80°C for total RNA or protein extraction.
For IHC staining: the remaining non-necrotic tumor
tissue specimen from each mouse was collected at the time
of sacrifice and formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded
(FFPE). FFPE blocks were sectioned using MICROM
HM325 Rotary Microtome (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc).

In vivo tumorigenicity assay
In vitro, MDA-MB-231-luc-D3H1 cells were
fraction-irradiated at 3.75 Gy/day for 5 days and were
cultured for 24 hours followed by an additional 24 hours
with or without the treatment of DSF/Cu (2.5 µM/1 µM).
Three groups of NOD/SCID mice (n=4) were injected
i.p. with either untreated MDA-MB-231-luc-D3H1 cells,
irradiated MDA-MB-231-luc-D3H1 cells treated with
DSF/Cu, or only irradiated MDA-MB-231-luc-D3H1
cells. The same number of cells was used for each group,
with 2x106 cells in 25 μL RPMI 1640 and 25 μL Matrigel
injected i.p. in each mouse. Tumorigenicity measured as
tumor growth was monitored in each mouse every 3-4
days by bioluminescence image (BLI) and tumor burden
quantitated as photons/second.

Analysis of areas of lung metastasis
At the time of sacrifice, mouse lungs were collected
as described above for histological analysis of lung
metastasis. Four micron-thick formalin-fixed paraffinembedded (FFPE) sections of mouse lung tissue from
treated BALB/c mice bearing 4T1 cell tumors were stained
with Mayer’s Hematoxylin (Sigma-Aldrich) and Eosin Y
solution (Sigma-Aldrich) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. The areas of the metastatic nodules in 10
randomly selected high-power fields (200x magnification)
per section were measured and calculated by the SPOT
Advanced Imaging software (Diagnostic Instruments).
The research fellow who analyzed the lungs was blinded
to the type of treatment received by the mice.

In vivo syngeneic tumor model
Mouse BC 4T1 cells (5x105 cells/mouse) were
implanted subcutaneously in the thigh of right hind leg
of BLAB/c mice. Body weight and tumor volume were
measured twice per week. Tumor volume was measured
by digital calipers. Treatments were initiated on day
7 when the tumor developed and had an approximate
diameter of 5 mm. Mice were divided into 4 groups (n=7)
using a stratified randomization strategy, such that the
difference of mean tumor volumes was not statistically
significant between each group (P>0.5). Mice in group 1
were treated with olive oil (vehicle control, 200 µL) orally
from day 7 to day 14. Mice in group 2 were treated with a
20Gy irradiation on day 10. Mice in group 3 were treated
with oral administration of DSF (50 mg/kg/day) from day
7 to day 14. Mice in group 4 were treated with a 20Gy
irradiation on day 10 and oral administration of DSF (50
mg/kg/day) from day 7 to day 14. All oral administration

IHC staining
Four micron-thick tissue sections were
deparaffinized and subjected to antigen retrieval.
Following incubation with blocking buffer, slides were
incubated with anti-Neu, -SOX9, -c-myc, and -WNT3
Abs overnight. Sections were then rinsed with TBST,
followed by 45-minute incubation with the EnVision™+
Dual Link System-HRP goat anti-rabbit Ig (Dako). The
detection of staining signals was performed with the DAB
Peroxidase Substrate Kit from Dako, and the sections
were counterstained with hematoxylin. Staining results of

stemness gene protein were analyzed by two investigators
who were blinded to the type of treatment received by
the mice, by counting the positive cells in 10 randomly
selected high-power (200x) fields. Complete membrane
staining was considered as positive for Neu expression;
nuclear staining was considered as positive for SOX9
and c-myc expression, and cell membrane and cytoplasm
staining were considered as positive for WNT3 expression.

For in vivo tumor volumes, estimation of the
treatment group specific mean responses over time and
their comparisons were performed by using longitudinal
general linear mixed effects model with compound
symmetry error covariance structure. The subject level
intercepts were random, and both time effect and time
x treatments interactions were considered fixed effects.
The longitudinal treatment effects were compared by
comparing the treatment specific slopes by linear contrast.
For all other data analysis, averages, standard deviations,
and unpaired t-tests were calculated using Microsoft
Excel. In vitro data shown represent the mean ± SD of the
results obtained in at least three independent experiments.
In vivo data shown represent the mean ± SD of the results
obtained in each group. Differences between groups were
