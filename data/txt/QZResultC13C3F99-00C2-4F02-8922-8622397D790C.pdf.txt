ABSTRACT
CXCL4 and CXCL4L1, platelet-derived CXC chemokines, and their carboxy-terminal
peptides CXCL447–70 and CXCL4L147–70 previously displayed angiostatic and anti-tumoral
activity in a melanoma model. Here, we found CXCL447–70 and CXCL4L147–70 to inhibit
lymphatic endothelial cell proliferation in vitro. Furthermore, the angiostatic potential
of CXCL447–70 and CXCL4L147–70 was tested against different angiogenic stimuli (FGF1,
FGF2, FGF8, EGF and VEGF). Besides reducing FGF2-induced vascular endothelial cell
growth, CXCL447–70 and CXCL4L147–70 efficiently counteracted EGF. Consequently, we
considered their anti-tumoral potential in EGF-dependent MDA-MB-231 breast tumors.
In tumor-bearing mice, CXCL447–70 reduced tumor growth better than CXCL4L147–70. In
CXCL447–70-treated tumors significantly more intratumoral monocytes/macrophages
and dendritic cells were present and higher expression levels of CCL5 and IFN-γ were
detected by qPCR on tumor lysates. Because neither peptide was able to specifically
bind CXCR3A or CXCR3B, differential glycosaminoglycan binding and direct interaction
with cytokines (EGF and CCL5) might explain any differences in anti-tumoral effects.
Notably, CCL5-induced monocyte chemotaxis in vitro was increased by addition of
CXCL447–70 or CXCL4L147–70. Finally, CXCL447–70 and CXCL4L147–70 inhibited proliferation
of MDA-MB-231 cells. Our results suggest a tumor type-dependent responsiveness to
either CXCL447–70 or CXCL4L147–70 treatment, defined by anti-proliferative, angiostatic
and inflammatory actions, and substantiate their therapeutic potential.

cytokines play an important role in immunity as they
control activation and migration of particular subsets of
leukocytes. Chemokines have been implicated though
in a variety of other biological processes, including
angiogenesis [8, 9]. A distinction should be made
between angiogenic (mostly CC and ELR-positive CXC
chemokines) and angiostatic chemokines (mostly ELRnegative CXC chemokines). The latter group comprises
the CXCR3 ligands, namely CXCL9/Monokine induced
by interferon-γ (Mig), CXCL10/Interferon-γ-induced
protein 10 (IP-10), CXCL11/Interferon-inducible T-cell α
chemoattractant (I-TAC), CXCL4/Platelet factor-4 (PF-4)

INTRODUCTION
Angiogenesis, the formation of an ever more
branching network of blood vessels from a pre-existing
vascular network, has been established as a requisite
for successful tumor growth and cancer progression
[1, 2]. Anti-angiogenic therapy thus offers a promising
approach to tackle one of the leading causes of mortality
worldwide. However, classic anti-angiogenic therapeutics
have encountered important hurdles and interest in less
obvious targets, including inflammatory mediators such
as the chemokines, increases [3–7]. These chemotactic

and CXCL4L1/PF-4variant. These CXCR3 ligands inhibit
endothelial cell proliferation and migration, favoring the
delicate angiogenic balance to shift towards angiostasis
[10, 11]. In keeping with a long line of research within our
group, the focus of this study lies with the platelet products
CXCL4 and CXCL4L1. These non-allelic variants
are both secreted by activated platelets as 70 amino
acid-long mature proteins, differing only in 3 residues
situated near the carboxy-terminal end (Pro58→ Leu58,
Lys66→ Glu66, Leu67→ His67 for CXCL4→ CXCL4L1)
[12]. Despite the limited amino acid substitutions,
the extent to which these affect protein structure, and
subsequently biological function, is remarkable. As a
single replacement, the shift from leucine on position 67
in CXCL4 to histidine in CXCL4L1 causes the carboxyterminal helix to protrude into the aqueous space thereby
exposing the entire helix [13]. This unique carboxyterminal 3D-structure of CXCL4L1 correlates with a
decrease in glycosaminoglycan (GAG) affinity and a
more outspoken angiostatic potential [13]. CXCL4L1 was
demonstrated to inhibit both CXCL8- and basic fibroblast
growth factor (FGF2)-induced endothelial cell chemotaxis
more efficiently than CXCL4. However, CXCL4L1 is
less likely to form heterodimers or compete for GAG
binding [14–16]. Interestingly, carboxy-terminal peptides
of both CXCL4 and CXCL4L1 have been illustrated
to preserve the angiostatic and anti-tumoral potential
[17–19]. CXCL4- and CXCL4L1-derived peptides are
excellent probes to unravel the working mechanism of
these angiostatic chemokines. A better understanding
could benefit future therapeutic use of CXCL4, CXCL4L1
or their derived peptides. Here, we further explored the
qualities of the carboxy-terminal peptides CXCL447–70 and
CXCL4L147–70 as anti-tumoral agents, more specifically
against a human epidermal growth factor (EGF)-dependent
tumor cell line, MDA-MB-231. Our in vitro data support
the hypothesis that both CXCL447–70 and CXCL4L147–70
retain their angiostatic potential. Both peptides were
shown to inhibit proliferation of microvascular
endothelial cells, including lymphatic endothelial cells.
We also demonstrated MDA-MB-231 tumor cells to be
sensitive to the anti-proliferative effect of CXCL447–70 and
CXCL4L147–70 in vitro. Surprisingly, mostly CXCL447–70
exerted an anti-tumoral effect on EGF-dependent MDAMB-231 tumor growth in vivo.

and CXCL4L147–70 retained the ability to block
FGF2-induced endothelial cell motility and proliferation [19].
We investigated whether CXCL447–70 and CXCL4L147–70
counteracted other growth factors with similar efficiency.
A screening was performed on bovine aortic endothelial cells
(GM7373) as shown in Figure 1A. Consistent with previous
work [19], both CXCL447–70 and CXCL4L147–70 (0.4 µg/ml)
reduced FGF2-induced GM7373 proliferation to
28 ± 10% and 47 ± 4%, respectively. The peptides’ effect on
epidermal growth factor (EGF) stimulation also stood out
as CXCL447–70 reduced GM7373 proliferation to 74 ± 3%.
Remarkably, CXCL4L147–70 consistently inhibited EGF’s
mitogenic activity more efficiently, lowering EGF-stimulated
proliferation to 49 ± 1%.

CXCL447–70 and CXCL4L147–70 inhibit human
endothelial cell proliferation
Our preliminary proliferation screenings suggested
angiogenic EGF stimulation to be particularly sensitive
to addition of CXCL4L147–70. Interestingly, EGF does not
rely on glycosaminoglycans (GAG) as co-receptors to
exert its activity. Furthermore, though intact CXCL4 has
been reported to counteract this growth factor, its mode
of action has yet to be fully unraveled [20]. We examined
proliferation of human retinal microvascular endothelial
cells (HMVEC) when stimulated with EGF as opposed to
a combination of EGF and CXCL447–70 or CXCL4L147–70
(Figure 1B). As expected, EGF (3 ng/ml) stimulated
HMVEC proliferation in an MTT assay with a proliferation
index (PI) of 1.42 ± 0.08 (n= 7). Further addition of
CXCL447–70 caused the PI to drop dose-dependently
(PI= 1.13 ± 0.07, p= 0.015, n= 7; PI= 0.96 ± 0.06, p= 0.003, n= 7;
PI= 0.93 ± 0.07, p= 0.008, n= 6 at 0.3, 1 and 3 µg/ml,
respectively). Similarly, CXCL4L147–70 also significantly
reduced EGF-induced proliferation (PI= 1.17 ± 0.06,
p= 0.041; PI= 1.05 ± 0.07, p= 0.015; PI= 0.98 ± 0.13, p= 0.041
at 0.3, 1 and 3 µg/ml, respectively; n= 7).
As single stimulus (without growth factor
stimulation) CXCL447–70 and CXCL4L147–70 significantly
reduced baseline proliferation (Figure 1C). CXCL447–70
reduced proliferation to a PI of 0.77 ± 0.08 (p= 0.011,
n= 8) and 0.59 ± 0.09 (p= 0.001, n= 6) at 1 µg/ml and
3 µg/ml, respectively. Similarly, the PI was lowered to
0.86 ± 0.12 (p= 0.043, n= 8) and 0.70 ± 0.09 (p= 0.009,
n= 7) after stimulation with the variant CXCL4L147–70 at
1 µg/ml and 3 µg/ml, respectively. The effect of CXCL447–70
on constitutive HMVEC proliferation was more prominent
than that of CXCL4L147–70.

GM7373 cells were incubated with a range of mitogenic stimuli either in the presence or absence of CXCL447–70 or CXCL4L147–70
(both 0.4 μg/ml) for 24 h (A). Cell counts after incubation with one of the carboxy-terminal peptides were expressed as percentages (mean

experiments were included in this preliminary screening, no statistical significance was reached. HMVEC were stimulated with either
control medium (CO), CXCL447–70 or CXCL4L147–70 (both 0.1 to 3 μg/ml), combined with 3 ng/ml EGF (B) or as single stimuli (C) over the
course of 3 to 4 days. Afterwards plates were developed according to MTT assay protocol. Optical density was determined at 570 nm and
630 nm. The proliferation index in condition X (mean ± s.e.m.) represents the ratio of the calculated ΔOD570–630X over ΔOD570–630CO,

p21 downregulation in EGF-stimulated endothelial cells.
Therefore, we studied the effects of chemokine-derived
peptides on p21 levels and, with it, their ability to arrest the
cell cycle. Evaluation of the p21 content in HMVEC did
confirm CXCL447–70 and CXCL4L147–70 to counteract the
tendency of EGF to reduce p21 (Figure 2). EGF (20 ng/ml)
reduced intracellular p21 to 75.82 ± 3.69% (n= 9; p< 0.001)
compared to control-treated levels. Addition of the peptides
in combination with EGF restored p21 levels to control
levels (i.e. p21 levels in the cells treated with peptide plus
EGF were not statistically different from buffer-treated
cells). After adding 1, 3 or 10 µg/ml CXCL447–70, p21
levels were also significantly higher than those in HMVEC
stimulated solely with 20 ng/ml EGF (106.90 ± 15.12%,
p= 0.039, n= 6; 100.02 ± 8.67%, p= 0.039, n= 9; and 125.51
± 15.05%, p= 0.005, n= 5, respectively). Stimulation with

p21 levels to 115.06 ± 17.41% (p= 0.033, n= 5).

(n= 4). The variant peptide CXCL4L147–70 reduced the PI
less efficiently to 0.90 ± 0.05 (p= 0.312, n= 4), 0.82 ± 0.05
and 0.66 ± 0.04 (both p= 0.030, n= 4) at 0.3, 1 and
3 µg/ml, respectively.

CXCL447–70 and CXCL4L147–70 reduce
proliferation of MDA-MB-231 cells
While most of the anti-tumoral effects of CXCL4
and CXCL4L1 have been attributed to their angiostatic
potential, little attention has been paid to the direct antiproliferative effect they may exert on malignant cells
themselves [25]. We evaluated proliferation of MDAMB-231, EGF-dependent breast cancer cells lacking
estrogen and progesterone receptor expression as well
as human EGF-receptor 2 (HER2) amplification (triplenegative) [26, 27]. Our results show that CXCL447–70
and CXCL4L147–70 were able to significantly and dosedependently reduce MDA-MB-231 proliferation (Figure 4).
The PI was lowered to 0.87 ± 0.04 (p= 0.023, n= 7),
0.66 ± 0.04 (p< 0.001, n= 7) and 0.21 ± 0.05 (p< 0.001, n= 3)
at 0.3, 3 and 10 µg/ml of CXCL447–70, respectively
(all conditions tested in triplicate). This indicates that
high doses of CXCL447–70 have a potent direct antiproliferative effect on MDA-MB-231 cells. Increasing
doses of CXCL4L147–70 also reduced the PI to 0.78 ± 0.04,
0.76 ± 0.08 and 0.26 ± 0.04 (p< 0.001, n= 7 at 3 µg/ml;
p= 0.01, n= 7 at 10 µg/ml; and p< 0.001, n= 3 at 30 µg/ml,
respectively; tested in triplicate). We attempted to
corroborate these data by assessment of the intracellular
p21 content, yet found this p53-dependent signaling

CXCL447–70 and CXCL4L147–70 reduce lymphatic
endothelial cell proliferation
Only recently, the link between the angiostatic
CXCR3 ligands and lymphangiogenesis was recognized
[21–23]. As the lymphatic vasculature has been implied
to be an escape route for metastatic tumor cells, its
blockade offers an interesting new therapeutic perspective
[24]. Though proliferation of human dermal lymphatic
microvascular endothelial cells (HLEC) was not
responsive to EGF-stimulation (data not shown), baseline
proliferation was indeed sensitive to CXCL447–70 and
CXCL4L147–70 (Figure 3). CXCL447–70 reduced the PI to
0.70 ± 0.06 (p= 0.030), 0.69 ± 0.06 (p= 0.030) and 0.37

to drop upon EGF stimulation (20 ng/ml), were also evaluated in HMVEC stimulated with EGF combined with either CXCL447–70 (0.3 to
10 μg/ml) or CXCL4L147–70 (0.3 to 3 μg/ml). The ratio of p21: total protein content was calculated for cell lysates after 15h incubation with
various stimuli. Results (mean ± s.e.m.) are expressed relative to the p21 content after control treatment (100%; dotted line). n= 4 to 9;

through external examination (Figure 5), we noted a
distinct reduction in tumor volume in CXCL447–70-treated
versus vehicle-treated mice from 11 days after tumor
cell inoculation onward (24 ± 6 mm³ and 176 ± 56 mm³,
respectively; p< 0.001, both n=10). At early stages up
till around 20 days after tumor cell inoculation, the
CXCL4L147–70-treated mice also displayed significantly
smaller tumors than their vehicle-treated counterparts
(61 ± 23 mm³ on day 11, p= 0.007, n=10). However, after
25 days CXCL4L147–70 appeared less effective than

vehicle (CO), CXCL447–70 or CXCL4L147–70 (2.5 µg; 3×/week from day 3 onwards). The tumor volume was measured externally with calipers
thrice a week and calculated using the formula (4πab2)/3 in which a and b are the largest and smallest radius, respectively. Growth curves

CXCL447–70 in the treatment of MDA-MB-231 tumors. At
day 25, the mean tumor volume in the vehicle-treated mice
amounted to 1116 ± 149 mm³, whereas CXCL447–70 treatment
had efficiently reduced tumor growth with a mean tumor
volume of 438 ± 97 mm³ (p= 0.002, both groups n= 10). The
effect of CXCL4L147–70 was not statistically different from
the control group (719 ± 153 mm³, p= 0.121, n= 10).
Afterwards, 27 to 28 days after initial MDAMB-231 cell injection, masses and volumes of resected
tumors were compared among the different treatment
groups (Figure 6). Average tumor volume among vehicletreated animals amounted to 845 ± 177 mm³, whereas
after periodical intratumoral injection of CXCL447–70
average tumor volume was reduced to 308 ± 61 mm³
(p= 0.001, n= 10). Total tumor mass was also reduced from
1464 ± 277 to 523 ± 108 mg on average (p= 0.002, n= 10).
Administration of CXCL4L147–70 did not significantly alter
tumor volume, nor mass (647 ± 161 mm³, p= 0.256 and 953 ±
208 mg, p= 0.091, respectively; both n= 10) after 4 weeks.

However the angiostatic activity of neither CXCL447–70, nor
CXCL4L147–70 was reflected by a reduced vascularization
of the resected MDA-MB-231 tumors (data not shown).
This inconsistency between our observations in vitro and
in vivo evokes the question which alternative mechanisms
may contribute to the anti-tumoral impact of peptide
treatment as evidenced in the MDA-MB-231 tumor model.

Tumor inflammation in CXCL447–70- and
CXCL4L147–70-treated MDA-MB-231 tumors
Although the used SCID mice are characterized
by defective T-lymphocyte development, monocyte,
macrophage and NK cell populations have been
shown to be unaffected in this mouse strain. We
investigated possible changes in the immunological
tumor microenvironment as a consequence of
CXCL447–70 or CXCL4L147–70 treatment. Expression
levels of various macrophage markers [29–31] were
evaluated, all showing on average an elevated mRNA
expression in the CXCL447–70-treated group (Figure  7).
However, only F4/80 mRNA levels were significantly
higher within resected tumors of CXCL447–70treated mice compared to control mice (p= 0.008, n= 10;
Figure 7A). These data indicate that intratumorally
administered CXCL447–70 may favor local monocyte

CXCL447–70: 7.70 ± 1.58% F4/80+ cells, n= 9). Overall,
enhanced F4/80 mRNA levels indeed statistically
correlated to an increased number of intratumoral F4/80+
cells (r=0.322 and p=0.011) (Figure 7B). Additionally,
specific markers for M1 and M2 macrophage polarization
were evaluated. TGM2 (Figure 7C) and CD204
(Figure 7D) are both specific markers of the pro-tumoral
M2 phenotype, as opposed to F4/80 which is a general
macrophage marker. These M2 markers exhibited only
a modest increase after CXCL447–70 treatment. M1
markers IL-12 (Figure 7E) and NOS2 (Figure 7F) also
only modestly increased after CXCL447–70 treatment,
not reaching statistical significance. Nevertheless,
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

M1-related IL-12 upregulation seems more pronounced
than that of TGM2 or CD204. Collectively, these
observations suggest that the number of both M1 and M2
macrophages increases and that there is no dominance of
a specific subtype. No significant changes in macrophage
marker expression were observed in CXCL4L147–70versus vehicle-treated mice. Flow cytometric analysis of
the tumor stroma did, however, suggest that CXCL4L147–70
also recruited macrophages (CXCL4L147–70: 7.74 ±
1.35% F4/80+ cells, n= 9). In order to corroborate and
further explore the inflammatory effect of our peptides,
tumoral expression of the dendritic cell marker CD11c
was evaluated (Figure 7G). CD11c mRNA was also
more prominent in CXCL447–70-treated compared to

Interaction of CXCL447–70 and CXCL4L147–70
with EGF and CCL5

evaluated intratumoral expression of interferon-γ (IFN-γ).
This cytokine could promote endogenous expression of
the CXCR3 ligands CXCL9, CXCL10 and CXCL11,
which in turn are anti-tumoral, angiostatic chemokines
[11]. As shown in Figure 7H, IFN-γ mRNA was most
prominent following CXCL447–70 treatment. The
significantly elevated expression of the inflammatory
cytokine IFN-γ possibly promotes anti-tumoral immunity
(cytotoxicity, phagocytosis) thereby contributing to the
anti-tumoral effect of CXCL447–70 in vivo.

Following studies by Nesmelova et al. [33] and
von Hundelshausen et al. [34], we explored whether
CXCL447–70 or CXCL4L147–70 could also directly interact
with other cytokines. In view of the role of EGF in the
MDA-MB-231 breast tumor model, we first evaluated
the ability of either peptide to bind to this growth factor
(Figure 9). EGF heterodimerization assays revealed EGF
to retain both CXCL447–70 and CXCL4L147–70 equally well
in a dose-dependent manner. These findings may present a
plausible explanation for the direct anti-proliferative effect
of both peptides on the EGF-dependent MDA-MB-231
tumor cells in vitro.
On the other hand, qPCR analysis showed the
MDA-MB-231 tumor stroma to express muCCL5
(Figure  10A), a monocyte chemotactic chemokine.
Stromal CCL5 expression was significantly upregulated
in CXCL447–70-treated mice (p= 0.020, n= 7). MDAMB-231 cells themselves were also observed to express
CCL5 in vitro, particularly upon TNF-α stimulation (data
not shown). CCL5 has previously been described to
multimerize with intact CXCL4 [34]. Therefore, binding
assays were performed to corroborate a possible interaction.
We found that both CXCL447–70 and CXCL4L147–70 directly
and equally well interacted with CCL5 (Figure  10B).
Considering previous reports of CCL5/CXCL4 multimers
synergistically increasing monocyte attraction [34], we
verified whether the interaction between the peptides and
CCL5 could contribute to an enhanced monocyte influx into
the tumors. It was demonstrated that adding CXCL447–70
or CXCL4L147–70 to CCL5 in the lower compartment
of multiscreen chemotaxis chambers enhanced
transendothelial migration of monocytic cells. Similar
to the intact chemokines, CXCL447–70 more efficiently
stimulated monocytic cell chemotaxis compared to
CXCL4L147–70 (Figure 10C). These findings could explain
the observed changes in the tumoral leukocyte population
following peptide treatment.

Cellular receptors of CXCL447–70 and
CXCL4L147–70
We further tried to reveal the mode of action of
CXCL447–70 and CXCL4L147–70. First, we excluded that
either peptide still binds/activates one of the CXCR3
isoforms, the receptors for intact CXCL4 and CXCL4L1.
We performed binding assays using 3 to 3000 ng/ml
of NH2-terminally biotinylated peptides and could not
detect specific binding to transfected CHO/CXCR3A, nor
CHO/CXCR3B cells by flow cytometric analysis (data
not shown). Nor could we detect any calcium signal in
CXCR3A-transfectants after treatment with 2 µg/ml of
CXCL447–70 or CXCL4L147–70 (Supplemental Figure 1).
Furthermore, neither peptide (2 µg/ml) was capable of
inhibiting calcium signaling by intact CXCL10 (5 ng/ml),
added to the cells as a second stimulus 100 s after addition
of one of the peptides.
Next, we exploited surface plasmon resonance
(SPR) analysis to assess the capacity of CXCL447–70 and
CXCL4L147–70 to bind heparin immobilized to a BIAcore
sensorchip, a model that mimics the binding of proteins
to heparan sulphate proteoglycans associated to the cell
surface [32]. When increasing concentrations of the
two peptides were injected onto the heparin surface,
sensorgram overlays (not shown) allowed the calculation
of association (Kon) and dissociation (Koff) rates and of
Kd (as Koff/Kon ratio, Table 1). Also, equilibrium binding
data were used to generate the saturation curves shown in
Figure 8A and used to calculate a Kd value independently
from kinetic parameters (Table 1). Together, the data
indicate that CXCL447–70 binds to immobilized heparin
with high affinity (Kd= 16–72 nM) whereas CXCL4L147–70
showed a very limited ability to bind the immobilized
glycosaminoglycan (Kd= 1000–1200 nM).
We could confirm the results from the SPR analysis
in an alternative GAG binding assay performed in
microtiter plates coated with heparin (Figure 8B). Dilution
series of biotinylated CXCL447–70 and CXCL4L147–70 were
added to investigate heparin affinity. Also in this assay
less biotinylated CXCL4L147–70 peptide bound to the
heparin-coated plate compared to biotinylated CXCL447–70,
indicative of either a lower affinity of CXCL4L147–70 for
heparin or a different stoichiometry of interaction.

DISCUSSION
The chemokines CXCL4 and CXCL4L1 have
both been attributed anti-tumoral activity as a result of
angiostatic action, blockade of lymphatic vessel formation
and the attraction of anti-tumoral lymphocytes [21, 23,
35, 36]. CXCL4L1 is considered to be a more powerful
angiostatic and anti-tumoral agent than its homologue
CXCL4, despite their striking 96% sequence identity
[15, 35]. This functional difference has been linked to
a single amino acid replacement, causing CXCL4L1
to adapt a unique carboxy-terminal 3D-structure with
decreased affinity for GAGs [13]. However, the causal
link remains puzzling, considering that CXCL4’s capacity

to bind GAGs, via a carboxy-terminal motif, has actually
long been thought to be the main contributor to its
angiostatic potential [18]. Moreover, carboxy-terminal
peptides restricted to the last 24 amino acids of either
CXCL4 (CXCL447–70) or CXCL4L1 (CXCL4L147–70) have
been described to retain their anti-angiogenic and antitumoral properties [18, 19]. In an attempt to understand
the working mechanism of both chemokines and thereby
their future possible therapeutic applicability, we studied
the angiostatic and anti-tumoral potential of these peptides
more in depth. Interestingly, in the here studied MDAMB-231 breast cancer model, CXCL4L147–70 loses its
relative potency over CXCL447–70. This is in contrast with
a previous study by our group demonstrating beneficial
effects of CXCL4L147–70, but not of CXCL447–70, in the
treatment of B16 melanoma. The anti-tumoral activity of
CXCL4L147–70 was ascribed to inhibition of angiogenesis
and induction of apoptosis within the B16 melanoma
tumor tissue [19]. In the MDA-MB-231 model, the antitumoral activity of the peptides probably depends more on
the establishment of an anti-tumoral immune response and
direct inhibition of tumor cell proliferation.
To reveal the molecular mechanisms involved
we explored different possibilities, the first being
direct molecular interaction between CXCL447–70 or
CXCL4L147–70 and other cytokines (e.g. CCL5 and
EGF). This heteromultimerization could change the
receptor-activating properties of the cytokines. Second,
binding to GAGs was assessed, which might affect
kinetics of in vivo availability. GAG binding could
also cause displacement of other cytokines from GAGs
(decreasing cytokine receptor activation) or, on the
contrary, could improve GAG interaction (enhancing
cytokine activity). Finally, in addition to receptorindependent activities and GAG binding, a cellular
receptor might be involved.
Concerning direct cytokine ligand interactions,
both positive and negative interactions have been

www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

described for intact CXCL4 [33, 34, 37, 38] and its
carboxy-terminal peptide [39]. CXCL4 has been
demonstrated to counteract angiogenic VEGF and FGF2,
by direct molecular interaction (heterodimerization) or
GAG-displacement [37, 38]. In contrast, intact CXCL4
enhances monocyte chemotactic activity of CCL5
through heteromultimerization [34]. In this study we
chose two cytokines important in our breast cancer
model and verified interaction with CXCL447–70 and
CXCL4L147–70: EGF as growth factor for the tumor cells
and CCL5 as attractant of monocytes/macrophages. Both
peptides bound with similar efficiency to immobilized
EGF or CCL5. Furthermore, addition of CXCL447–70 or
CXCL4L147–70 to CCL5 in a monocyte transendothelial
migration assay increased monocyte chemotactic
activity. On the other hand, we could not demonstrate
binding or activation of CXCR3 by CXCL447–70 or
CXCL4L147–70 suggesting that either no cellular receptor
or a still unidentified receptor is activated. Alternatively,
because the 47–70 carboxy-terminal domain contains
the main GAG interaction site of CXCL4, we assessed
heparin affinity of both peptides. We confirmed already
published findings that CXCL447–70 still interacts with
heparin [18]. The heparin affinity of CXCL447–70 was
higher than that of CXCL4L147–70. We therefore expect
CXCL447–70 to be retained longer at the site of injection
and to exert its anti-tumoral activities over a longer
time period. Our findings could explain the apparent
difference between almost equal potency of the peptides
in vitro (Figures 1–4) compared to more outspoken antitumoral activity for CXCL447–70 in this in vivo breast
cancer model.
Perception of the role of the immune system in
tumor development has changed over time. Tumor
inflammation is indeed the seventh hallmark of malignant
disease, but the sizeable myeloid population present has
been mostly observed to take on a tumor-promoting role
rather than exert its protective, phagocytic and cytotoxic

function [40–42]. This shift could be attributed to the
phagocytes’ versatility and their ability to adopt distinct
phenotypes influenced by locally produced factors [43].
Rather than depleting the tumoral myeloid cell population,
it could be beneficial to tackle its polarization and to have
its pro-inflammatory actions complement anti-tumoral
treatment. Therapeutic reversion of the tumor-associated
leukocyte polarization could alter their impact on tumor
progression, favoring anti-tumor immunity. Previously,
CXCL4 has been reported to promote monocyte
survival and macrophage activation [44]. This fits with
the observed upregulation of macrophage markers in
CXCL447–70-treated tumors. The carboxy-terminal CXCL4
peptide could potentially maintain its effect on monocyte
survival and activation, thereby leading to an expanding
intratumoral macrophage population. As a single stimulus,
CXCL447–70 has been stated not to stimulate monocytic
THP-1 migration [19]. Interestingly however, as already
discussed, we revealed CXCL447–70 and CXCL4L147–70 to
be able to multimerize with the monocyte chemoattractant
CCL5, consequently enhancing migration of monocytic
cells in vitro. Especially because the in vivo angiostatic
effects were less prominent in this study, our results
suggest that the CXCL447–70-specific immunological effect
might be a driving force behind its in vivo induced tumor
growth retardation.
We did also confirm the conservation of angiostatic
activity for both carboxy-terminal platelet factor peptides
in vitro [17, 19]. Where our previous study has focused
on the inhibitory effect of the peptides on endothelial
cell migration, we now report anti-proliferative effects
of CXCL447–70 and CXCL4L147–70 on both blood and
lymphatic endothelial cells. Broadening the spectrum
of activity to include blockade of lymphangiogenesis
offers an interesting new therapeutic perspective as the
lymphatic vasculature has been implied to be an escape
route for metastatic tumor cells [21].
To date, anti-angiogenic therapy has not delivered on
expectations in cancer research. Where anti-angiogenesis
falls short, the immune system seems to play a critical
role. Alternative avenues need to be explored. Here, we
illustrate the anti-proliferative, angiostatic, inflammatory
and overall anti-tumoral actions of carboxy-terminal
peptides CXCL447–70 and CXCL4L147–70, which are in line
with the effects of the original full-length mature proteins.
However, the sum of their actions and eventual impact in
vivo appear to be tumor model-dependent. Such a tumordependent therapy responsiveness to treatment would have
important implications towards future therapeutic use of
CXCL4, CXCL4L1 and derived peptides. In conclusion,
this study illustrates, angiostatic chemokines such as
CXCL4, CXCL4L1 and their derived peptides could fit
the profile of multifunctional new anti-cancer therapeutics
perfectly.

Synthesis and purification of CXCL447–70 and
CXCL4L147–70
The human carboxy-terminally derived peptides
of  the chemokines CXCL4 and CXCL4L1, namely
CXCL447–70 and CXCL4L147–70, were synthesized by
fluorenyl methoxycarbonyl (Fmoc) chemistry on a P11
peptide synthesizer (Activotec, Cambridge, UK) and
purified by reversed phase chromatography as previously
described [19]. Side-specific coupling of biotin to the
N-terminus of the peptides was performed on the peptide
synthesizer by activating and coupling biotin-ONp
(Biotin p-nitrophenyl ester, Novabiochem, Darmstadt,
Germany) on the Fmoc-deprotected N-terminus with the
same program that was used for coupling the individual
Fmoc-amino acids. This results in exactly one biotin
group attached to the N-terminus of the peptide without
modification of the side chains of lysine residues. Peptide
purity, concentration and molecular mass were verified by
ion trap mass spectrometry (Bruker, Bremen, Germany).

Cell cultures
Preliminary tests were performed on fetal bovine
aortic endothelial GM7373 cells [45], obtained from
the N.I.G.M.S. Human Genetic Mutant Cell Repository
(Institute for Medical Research, Camden, NJ) and grown
in Eagle’s MEM containing 10% fetal calf serum (FCS).
HMVEC (Cell Systems, Kirkland, WA) and HLEC
(Lonza, Verviers, Belgium) were grown in endothelial
basal medium-2 (EBM-2) enriched with endothelial
growth medium-2 MV Bulletkit (Lonza), following the
manufacturer’s instructions. In order to investigate the
anti-tumoral effects of the chemokine-derived peptides,
the EGF-dependent tumor cell line MDA-MB-231 was
purchased from ATCC (Manassas, VA) and cultured in
DMEM (Lonza) with 10% FCS. Human acute monocytic
leukemia cells (THP-1) were cultured as previously
described [46].

Cell proliferation assays
MTT proliferation assay
First, HMVEC and HLEC were seeded at 5 × 103
cells/well in EBM-2 + 1% FCS in a 96-well plate, whereas
MDA-MB-231 were starved of growth factors overnight
by replacing their growth medium with DMEM (serumfree) prior to seeding the tumor cells at 15 × 10² cells/
well in DMEM + 1% FCS. As for the rest of the assay,
the same protocol applies to all cells. Once adherent,
cells were incubated with different concentrations of the

or in combination with recombinant human EGF (3 ng/ml;
R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) at 37°C/5% CO2. All
conditions were tested in triplicate or quadruplicate.
After 3 to 4 days, stimulation medium was removed and
a sterile MTT solution was added [0.04 g/100 ml thiazolyl
blue (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) in 20% PBS/80%
RPMI without phenol red (Lonza)] for 3 to 4 hours. The
formed formasan crystals were dissolved by replacing the
MTT solution with acidic propanol (0.04 M HCl, 0.1%
(v/v) Nondet P-40 in absolute isopropanol) and shaking
the plate, shielded from light, for 10 minutes. Optical
density (OD) was determined at 570 nm and 630 nm. The
obtained ODs were processed to proliferation indexes (PI),
expressed relative to appropriate buffer controls,
i.e. ΔOD570–630X over ΔOD570–630CO.

(endotoxin-free BSA; Sigma CatN° A8806) after
centrifugation of the cells at 200g for 10 min. Plates were
incubated at 37°C for 3 to 5 hours before quantifying the
amount of cells that migrated towards the chemokine
concentrations. For that purpose, we used the ATPlite
kit (PerkinElmer, Waltham, MA) allowing quantitative
luminescent detection of ATP, which is representative of
THP-1 cell counts in the lower wells. This reaction was
performed in a view white 96-well plate (PerkinElmer).
A chemotactic index (CI) was calculated, defined as the
ratio of luminescence after chemokine treatment and
luminescence after control treatment.

Intracellular p21 signaling assay
Signaling assays [23] were slightly adapted
to the signaling molecules of interest in this study.
HMVEC were stimulated with EGF (20 ng/ml) as a
single stimulus or in combination with the peptides
CXCL447–70 and CXCL4L147–70 (0.3 to 10 µg/ml)
in order to evaluate their impact on the cell cyclearresting p21. After 15 hours, the cells were washed
three times with ice-cold PBS to stop the stimulation
and lysis buffer [1 mM EDTA, 0.5% (v/v) Triton-X,
10 mM NaF, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM DTT in PBS; pH
7.2–7.4] supplemented with a protease inhibitor
cocktail (Sigma) was added. Cell residue was removed
from the collected lysates by centrifugation (4°C,
10 min, 1666g). Lastly, the intracellular p21 content was
determined by DuoSet® IC ELISA (cat n° DYC1047,
R&D Systems) while, in parallel, total protein content
was measured in a bicinchoninic acid (BCA) protein
assay (Pierce, Rockford, IL).

GM7373
cells were performed as described [47]. Briefly,
subconfluent cultures of GM7373 cells were seeded
in 96-well dishes at 65 × 10³ cells/cm². After 16 h,
cells were incubated in triplicate in fresh medium
containing 0.4% FCS plus FGF1 (30 ng/ml),
FGF2 (10 ng/ml), FGF8 (30 ng/ml), EGF (10 ng/ml),
VEGF (30 ng/ml), 12-O-tetradecanoyl phorbol
13-acetate (TPA, 10 ng/ml) or 10% FCS in the absence
or in the presence of 400 ng/ml of CXCL447–70 or
CXCL4L147–70. After 24 h, cells were trypsinized and
counted in a Bürker chamber. Data were expressed
as percentages of cell proliferation measured in the
presence of the mitogenic stimulus alone.

Transendothelial multiscreen chemotaxis assay

In vivo tumor experiment

Monocyte chemotaxis assays were performed
on 5 µm hydrophilic polycarbonate multiscreen-MIC
plates (Millipore) using the human acute monocytic
leukemia cells (THP-1). To promote efficient
synergy between CCL5 on one hand and CXCL4,
CXCL447–70 or CXCL4L147–70 on the other hand, the
upper compartment of these plates was coated with
a HMVEC monolayer. HMVEC were seeded on a
0.1% gelatin layer 24 hours prior to the chemotaxis
assay. The following day, dilutions of recombinant
human CCL5 (PeproTech, Rocky Hill, CT), natural
human CXCL4 (isolated from stimulated platelets
as previously described) [15], recombinant human
CXCL4L1 (isolated from baculovirus-infected Sf9 cells
as previously described) [23], synthetic CXCL447–70,
synthetic CXCL4L147–70 (both produced as described
above), or combinations thereof were added to the
lower compartment of the plate, in a volume of 150 µl.
After removal of the HMVEC medium, 0.35 × 106
THP-1 cells were added to the upper wells, resuspended
in phenol red-free RPMI + 0.1 g/100 ml BSA

SCID mice were bred in specific-pathogen-free
conditions in the Experimental Animal Breeding Facility
of the University of Leuven (KU Leuven) and fed sterilized
food and water. All animal experiments were conducted in
agreement with the Ethical Committee for Animal Care
and Use of the KU Leuven and executed under license
number LA1210243. 7- to 10-week-old SCID mice were
used throughout the experiments. MDA-MB-231 cells in
log growth phase (6 × 106 cells resuspended in 200 µl of
PBS) were injected subcutaneously (s.c.) on day 0 in the
right dorsal flank. Animals were treated by intratumoral
injection with control, 2.5 µg synthetic human CXCL447–70
peptide or synthetic human CXCL4L147–70 peptide three
times a week starting from day 3. The external tumor
volume was measured with calipers thrice a week and
calculated using the formula (4πab2)/3 in which a and b
are the largest and smallest radius, respectively. On day
27 or 28, mice were sacrificed and tumors were resected.
The exact tumor volume of the resected tumor, based on
three measured radii (a, b and c), was calculated by the

use of the High Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription
Kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Quantitative
polymerase chain reactions (qPCR) based on the TaqMan
principle were conducted to compare gene expression
between samples. Primers and probes (Table 2; Integrated
DNA Technologies, Haasrode, Belgium), were diluted to
the prescribed working concentrations in RNase-free water
and added to the reaction mix in a MicroAmp® fast optical
96-well reaction plate (Applied Biosystems), together with
50 ng sample cDNA per reaction. The actual thermocycler
program consisted of 2 minutes on 50 °C, 10 minutes on
95 °C and 40 cycles of 15 seconds on 95 °C followed by
1 minute on 60 °C. Analysis of the obtained CT was based
on the 2-ΔΔCT method, opting for 18S ribosomal 1 RNA as
an internal control [48].

Flow cytometric analysis of F4/80+ cells
For flow cytometry, single cell suspensions were
prepared from tumor biopsies using a MACS dissociator
(Myltenyi Biotec, Bergisch Gladbach, Germany) and
a mixture of collagenase A and dispase. Remaining cell
clumps were removed by passing the cell suspension
through a nylon cell strainer (70 µm mesh). Remaining
red blood cells were lysed in ACK lysis buffer
(0.15 M NH4Cl, 0.1 mM Na2EDTA, 10 mM KHCO3;
pH = 7.2). Subsequently monocytes were identified by
flow cytometry using specific antibodies, namely rat antimouse F4/80-PE antibody (eBiosciences, San Diego, CA).

SPR measurements were performed on a BIAcore
X100 instrument (GE-Healthcare, Milwaukee, WI).
Research-grade SA sensorchip was used. For the study

biotinylated at its reducing end and immobilized onto the
SA streptavidin-coated sensorchip. These experimental
conditions allowed the immobilization of 200 resonance

RBAP11H2R9 2011) and Associazione Italiana per la
Ricerca sul Cancro (AIRC grant n° 10396), as well as
by the Fund for Scientific Research of Flanders (FWOVlaanderen project G.0764.14 and G.0773.13), the
Interuniversity Attraction Poles Programme initiated by
the Belgian Science Policy Office (I.A.P. project P7/40)
and the Concerted Research Actions of the Regional
Government of Flanders (GOA13/014). The Hercules
foundation of the Flemish government provided funding
to purchase the LC-MS/MS equipment (AKUL/11/31).

GAG binding and heterodimerization assays in
96-well plates
GAG, EGF and CCL5 binding were quantified in
96-well plates following a similar protocol. GAG binding
was evaluated by immobilizing low molecular weight
heparin (Iduron, Manchester, UK) on EpranEx plates (BD
Biosciences), whereas EGF as well as CCL5 recombinant
human protein (R&D Systems and PeproTech,
respectively) was immobilized on high protein-binding
ELISA plates (Corning life sciences, Tewksbury, MA).
In brief, 25 μg/ml GAG [diluted in assay buffer 100 mM
NaCl, 50 mM NaAc, pH 7.2, and 0.2% (v/v) Tween-20],
2 µg/ml EGF or 50 ng/ml CCL5 (both diluted in PBS),
was coated overnight at room temperature on 96-well
plates. Plates were washed three times with either assay
buffer or 0.5% (v/v) Tween 20 in PBS and blocked at
37°C with buffer enriched with either 0.2% (w/v) gelatin
(heparin binding assay) or 0.1% (w/v) casein (EGF or
CCL5 binding assay). Subsequently, a dilution curve
of biotinylated CXCL4L147–70 and CXCL447–70 peptide
was pipetted on the plate and incubated at 37 °C to
allow interaction with heparin, EGF or CCL5. After
washing, retained biotinylated peptide was detected
by peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin. Peroxidase
activity was quantified by measuring the conversion of
3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine (Sigma-Aldrich) at 450 nm.

Ethical standards and conflict of interest
Design and execution of all experiments are
compliant with current legal requirements as stated by
Belgian law. The authors also declare that they have no
conflict of interest.
