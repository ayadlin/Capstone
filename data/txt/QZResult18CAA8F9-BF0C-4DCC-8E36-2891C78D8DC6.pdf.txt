ABSTRACT
A significant fraction of patients with lung adenocarcinomas harboring activating
epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations do not experience clinical benefits
from EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) therapy. Using next-generation sequencing,
we screened 739 mutation hotspots in 46 cancer-related genes in EGFR L858R-mutant
lung adenocarcinomas from 29 patients who received EGFR-TKI therapy; 13 had
short (< 3 months) and 16 had long (> 1 year) progression-free survival (PFS). We
discovered MLH1 V384D as a genetic variant enriched in the group of patients with
short PFS. Next, we investigated this genetic variation in 158 lung adenocarcinomas
with the EGFR L858R mutation and found 14 (8.9%) patients had MLH1 V384D;
available blood or non-tumor tissues from patients were also tested positive for MLH1
V384D. Patients with MLH1 V384D had a significantly shorter median PFS than those
without (5.1 vs. 10.6 months; P= 0.001). Multivariate analysis showed that MLH1
V384D polymorphism was an independent predictor for a reduced PFS time (hazard
ratio, 3.5; 95% confidence interval, 1.7 to 7.2; P= 0.001). In conclusion, MLH1 V384D
polymorphism is associated with primary resistance to EGFR-TKIs in patients with
EGFR L858R-positive lung adenocarcinoma and may potentially be a novel biomarker
to guide treatment decisions.

INTRODUCTION

tumors of a subset of patients with non-small cell lung
cancer (NSCLC) who responded dramatically to EGFR
tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) [2,3]. This discovery
has opened a new era of targeted therapy for NSCLC.
Nowadays, EGFR-TKIs are used as the standard first-line
therapy for patients with advanced lung adenocarcinoma
harboring activating EGFR mutations [4,5], and they
remarkably improve the survival and quality of life in
patients with these driver mutations [6].

Lung cancer has high incidence rates worldwide,
and its 5-year survival is dismal as most cases are
diagnosed at late stages. Chemotherapy, although with
limited efficacy, used to be the main treatment option for
patients with advanced lung cancer [1]. In 2004, somatic
mutations were reported to exist in the tyrosine kinase
domain of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) in

Drug resistance is a major obstacle in targeted cancer
therapy, and understanding the mechanisms of resistance is
pivotal for developing more effective treatment strategies.
Around 70% of patients with lung adenocarcinoma that
has activating EGFR mutations (mostly a small in-frame
deletion in exon 19 and a substitution mutation L858R)
display objective clinical response to EGFR-TKI treatment
[7-11]. However, despite the initial disease control, tumor
relapse is inevitably observed after a median of 9-14
months, indicating the development of acquired resistance
to EGFR-TKIs in these patients [7-9,11]. Studies have
identified different mechanisms of acquired EGFR-TKI
resistance, including a second-site EGFR T790M mutation
[12,13], MET amplification [14,15], PIK3CA mutations
[16], FGFR1 activation [17] , epithelial-to-mesenchymal
transitions and conversion to small cell carcinoma [16,
18-19]. On the other hand, ~30% patients with TKIsensitive EGFR mutations fail to demonstrate objective
tumor regression on initial EGFR-TKI therapy and are
defined as having primary or intrinsic resistance [7,9,11].
Some co-existing genetic variations have been implicated
in the mechanism of TKI insensitivity in EGFR-mutant
patients, including de novo presence of EGFR T790M or
MET amplification [20,21], KRAS mutations [22], loss of
PTEN [23], and a germline deletion polymorphism of BIM
[24]. However, the majority of resistant cases cannot be
explained by these variations and the mechanistic basis for
intrinsic EGFR-TKI resistance in patients supposed to be
responsive is still largely unknown.
In this study, we hypothesized that specific genetic
alterations may underlie the primary resistance to EGFRTKIs in lung adenocarcinoma harboring activating EGFR
mutations. Towards uncovering such genetic determinants
of treatment resistance, we performed next-generation
sequencing (NGS)-based mutation profiling of lung
adenocarcinomas with the EGFR L858R mutation from
patients who received EGFR-TKI therapy, and searched
for genetic variants/mutations that could differentiate
patients displaying primary resistance to EGFR-TKIs from
those having a durable response.

without the simultaneous presence of the T790M allele
that predicts EGFR-TKI resistance. Among the 46 genes,
KDR (which encodes for vascular endothelial growth
factor receptor 2) was the most commonly mutated gene
coexisting with EGFR L858R, regardless of the patient’s
treatment response. Mutation rates of ABL1, APC, and
PDGFRA were disproportionately high in the patient
with long PFS. In contrast, mutations in FGFR2 (K368E),
KRAS (G12D), MLH1 (V384D), and TP53 occurred more
often in patients with short PFS. Derepression of FGFR2
expression has been implicated in the mechanism for
rapidly acquired EGFR-TKI resistance in NSCLC cells
[12]. KRAS G12C is linked to poor outcomes of EGFRTKI therapy in NSCLC patients [13]. A study shows
higher p53 mutation rates in advanced-stage than in
early-stage lung cancers and suggests that the concurrent
occurrence of p53 mutations with EGFR mutations may
foster the development of therapeutic resistance [25].
However, the DNA mismatch repair gene MLH1 has not
been associated with EGFR-TKI resistance yet.

MLH1 V384D in patients with primary lung
adenocarcinoma
We examined the mutation status of MLH1 in a
larger set of EGFR L858R-positive lung adenocarcinomas.
A total of 158 tumors were subjected to MLH1 mutation
analysis by direct sequencing of PCR products. Fourteen
of the 158 tumors (8.9%) had a heterozygous T→A
change at nucleotide 1151 (Fig. 2A) which results in
the same V384D substitution in MLH1 as discovered in
NGS screening. We were able to analyze genomic DNA
from blood specimens of 4 patients and non-tumor tissue
specimens from 1 patient, and all of these samples were
tested positive for MLH1 V384D (as in Fig. 2A). Clinical
characteristics of patients with or without MLH1 V384D
were analyzed (Table 1), and no statistically significant
demographic differences between the two groups were
noted. We also performed sequencing analysis of MLH1
exon 12 in 51 EGFR-wildtype lung adenocarcinomas and
found a comparable incidence (4/51, 7.8%) of the MLH1
V384D allele.

RESULTS

Tumor response to EGFR-TKI

Forty-six-gene mutation profiles of EGFR L858Rpositive lung adenocarcinomas

A representative tumor with concurrent EGFR
L858R and MLH1 V384D mutations displayed primary
resistance to EGFR-TKI treatment (Fig. 2B). We evaluated
individual tumor responses to EGFR-TKIs in patients
whose tumors were of measurable sizes. Twenty-four
of the NGS-screened 29 patients were monitored, and
the tumor responses and PFS clustered correspondingly
(Fig. 3A); 5 of 10 (50%) patients with short PFS had
progressive disease whilst on EGFR-TKI treatment and
13 of 14 (92.9%) patients with long PFS had a partial

NGS was used to interrogate mutations within
hotspot regions of 46 cancer-related genes in lung
adenocarcinoma samples from 13 and 16 EGFR-TKItreated patients who had short (< 3 months) and long (>
1 year) PFS, respectively. Differential mutation patterns
were revealed in these two groups (Fig. 1 and more details
in the Supplementary Appendix). All 29 tumors were
confirmed to harbor the activating EGFR L858R mutation

response to EGFR-TKIs. Among the 4 patients with the
MLH1 V384D allele, 2 had progressive disease and 2 had
stable disease; none of the patients with partial response
carried the MLH1 V384D allele.
In the 158 patients examined for MLH1 mutations
by PCR and Sanger sequencing, 155 had measurable
tumors and their responses to EGFR-TKIs were monitored
(Fig. 3B). The overall response rate was 69.7%; 108, 39
and 8 patients achieved partial response, stable disease
and progressive disease, respectively. The response rates
for tumors with and without MLH1 V384D mutation were
50% and 71.6%, respectively (P= 0.088). MLH1 V384Dpositive tumors had a smaller size reduction in response to
EGFR-TKI treatment than that in tumors without the allele

(median size change -28.2% vs. -40.5%, P= 0.015, MannWhitney U test). The MLH1 V384D allele was overrepresented in patients with EGFR-TKI resistance. Only
11 of 155 (7.1%) EGFR L858R-positive tumors showed
disease progression under EGFR-TKI treatment, and 4
of these 11 (36.4%) had MLH1 V384D. Among the 144
tumors either showing a partial response or being stable
on treatment, only 10 (6.9%) were MLH1 V384D-positive.

47.4 months, 51 patients remained in use of an EGFR-

TKI and 107 patients (67.7%) had experienced PFS. The
overall median PFS was 10.5 months (95% CI, 8.1 to 12.8
months). Patients with the MLH1 V384D mutation had a
significant shorter PFS (median, 5.1 months; 95% CI, 1.5
to 8.7 months) than that of those without (median, 10.6
months; 95% CI, 8.8 to 12.5 months) (P= 0.001) (Fig.
4). Gender (male vs. female, P= 0.031) and the number
of prior chemotherapy (0 vs. ≥ 1, P= 0.002) were also
predictor variables for PFS. In the multivariate analysis
using the Cox regression model, only the number of prior
treatment (HR= 2.3, 95% CI, 1.4 to 3.8; in favor of none;
P= 0.001) and the MLH1 mutation status (HR= 3.5, 95%
CI, 1.7 to 7.2; in favor of no V384D mutation; P= 0.001)
were independent predictors for PFS.

of colon cancer and other malignancies. Recognition of
DNA damage by the MMR system is instrumental for
activation of the apoptosis cascade; therefore, cells with
MMR dysfunction may not properly induce apoptosis in
response to DNA damage. Indeed, dysfunctional MMR
has been implicated in the mechanism of resistance to
DNA-damaging chemotherapeutics such as cisplatin [27].
However, to our knowledge, MLH1 and other MMR genes
have never been linked to EGFR-TKI resistance.
Although many MLH1 variants are known [28,29],
only the V384 variant was identified in this study. MLH1
V384D was first identified in Chinese colorectal cancer
patients and shown to be a common (2.5-2.67% in normal
individuals) germline polymorphism in the East-Asian
population [29,30]. The detection of MLH1 V384D in
blood or non-tumor tissue samples of patients with EGFR
L858R-mutant lung adenocarcinoma also suggests that
it is not a somatic mutation but a germline mutation/
polymorphism. Similar to the reported 7.7% allele
frequency in Chinese colorectal cancer patients [30], we
found an incidence of MLH1 V384D around 7-8% in
tumors with wild-type or L858R mutant EGFR, suggesting
that MLH1 V384D may not be a mutation secondary to the
EGFR L858R mutation. Whether the presence of MLH1
V384D increases the rates of activating EGFR mutations
requires further investigation to determine.
The exact mechanism of how the MLH1 V384D
variant influences EGFR-TKI treatment response on
EGFR L858R-mutant tumors is not clear at present.
A few possible scenarios are hereby presented: i) The
MLH1 V384D variant is, at least partially, impaired
in its protein function, displaying decreased efficiency
in the interaction with its partner protein PMS2 and
showing reduced MMR activity in vitro [28,29]. As MMR

DISCUSSION
Our NGS-based multi-gene mutation profiling of
lung adenocarcinomas carrying the activating EGFR
mutation L858R has uncovered an MLH1 V384D allele
that is over-represented in a subset of tumors showing
primary resistance to EGFR-TKIs. We have validated the
disproportionately high occurrence of the MLH1 V384D
allele in patients showing poor response to EGFR-TKI
treatment, and demonstrated that MLH1 V384D is
associated with a shorter PFS.
MLH1 is a component of the cellular DNA
mismatch repair (MMR) machinery [26]. The MMR
system is responsible for the recognition and repair of
single-base mismatches and short insertions/deletions that
may arise during DNA replication and recombination.
Inherited mutations in the MMR system can cause
genomic instability and human diseases such as Lynch
syndrome; individuals with this syndrome are at high risk

Finally, we only included EGFR L858R-mutant tumors in
this study. Patients with L858R and those with another
prevalent EGFR-activating mutation, a small deletion in
exon 19, have different EGFR-TKI treatment outcomes
[36,37]. It is conceivable that these two different
activating EGFR mutations may not associate with the
same mechanism of primary resistance to TKIs.
In conclusion, this study has identified a novel
candidate for genetic predictor of primary EGFRTKI resistance in EGFR L858R-positive lung
adenocarcinomas. Patients with EGFR L858R-mutant
lung adenocarcinoma have inferior EGFR-TKI treatment
outcomes if they have a co-existing MLH1 V384D
variant. Future prospective clinical studies are warranted
to confirm the prognostic importance of MLH1 V384D, as
well as to define appropriate combinations of anti-cancer
therapeutics in treating tumors with concomitant existence
of EGFR L858R and MLH1 V384D alleles.

contributes to genome stability, cancer cells with MLH1
V384D may hence be prone to accumulating mutations
during cancer progression. This mutator phenotype could
facilitate the acquisition of additional driver mutations
in alternative proliferation or survival pathways, and
enable cancer cells to become resistant to EGFRtargeting therapies. ii) Activated EGFR can translocate
from cell membrane into the nucleus to execute several
important functions, including DNA repair [31]. EGFRTKI therapy inhibits the kinase activity and interferes
with nuclear translocation of EGFR, which may possibly
increase DNA damage. Because MLH1 is responsible for
recognizing DNA damage and activating the apoptotic
pathway, cells expressing the functionally impaired MLH1
V384D variant may not enter apoptosis efficiently and
thus still display unchecked proliferation under EGFRTKI treatment. iii) Besides mechanisms attributable to
MMR dysfunction, we cannot exclude the possibility that
MLH1 may have MMR-independent functions involved
in EGFR signaling or other proliferation or survival
pathways. Further investigation is warranted to elucidate
the principal mechanism underlying the MLH1 V384Dassociated EGFR-TKI resistance.
This study has important clinical implications.
Instead of discovering additional “driver” mutations, we
have identified a germline polymorphism associating with
primary resistance to EGFR-TKIs. The first implication of
this study is that: not only pathway-activating mutations in
tumors but also germline genetic variations in individuals
should be considered for molecular testing in the era of
“personalized therapy”. In line with this notion, both
tumor and blood samples should be archived to facilitate
future translational studies. Secondly, our findings suggest
that the combination of EGFR-TKIs with other anticancer therapeutics may be a rational treatment strategy
for patients with lung adenocarcinomas concurrently
harboring a somatic EGFR L858R mutation in the tumor
and a germline MLH1 V384D polymorphism. In fact,
combination therapy has been proved to be a successful
strategy to overcome other types of EGFR-TKI resistance
mechanism [32,33].
There are some limitations of this study. Firstly,
although all imaging studies were interpreted by two
independent reviewers who were not aware of patients’
molecular profiles, all clinical data were collected
retrospectively. Secondly, only a small number of
tissue samples were in adequate amounts for molecular
analysis during the study period; therefore, unintentional
selection bias might exist as it could not have been
prevented. Thirdly, although the NGS-based cancer panel
is a powerful tool for detecting hundreds of mutations,
this screening platform cannot identify certain genetic
alterations, such as gene amplification and rearrangement.
There exist examples of these types of genomic variations,
e.g., MET amplification and ALK rearrangement, which
are associated with EGFR-TKI resistance [14,34,35].

METHODS
Patients and study design
Patients were included if they had primary lung
adenocarcinoma harboring the L858R mutation without a
co-existing T790M mutation in EGFR and received their
first-time EGFR-TKI treatment at Taipei Veterans General
Hospital during the period from January 2009 to January
2013. Patients who had prior EGFR-TKI therapy or
received EGFR-TKI in combination with other anti-cancer
treatment were excluded. Patients who had adequate tumor
specimens for further molecular testing were enrolled.
This study was approved by the Institution Review Board
of Taipei Veterans General Hospital.
If tumors progressed within 3 months of the
initiation of EGFR-TKI therapy, we considered that the
treatment was clinically ineffective and that these patients
presented primary (or intrinsic) resistance. To discover
candidate genetic variations that may associate with
primary EGF-TKI resistance in EGFR mutant tumors, we
performed genomic profiling of EGFR L858R tumors from
16 patients with long (> 1 year) progression-free survival
(PFS) and 13 patients with short (< 3 months) PFS. NGS
was performed to screen through a cancer-related gene
mutation panel (Ion AmpliSeq Cancer Panel, Ion Torrent,
Life Technologies); 739 mutation hotspot regions within
46 key cancer-related genes from the COSMIC database
were examined. Distributions of genomic variants in
the two groups of patients were compared. Genes with
differential mutation status between two groups were
further investigated in a total of 158 EGFR L858R tumors
by PCR amplification and direct Sanger sequencing, and
the association of candidate variants with differential
tumor response to EGFR-TKIs was explored.
