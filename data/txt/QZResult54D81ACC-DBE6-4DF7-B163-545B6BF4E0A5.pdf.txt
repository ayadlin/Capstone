ABSTRACT
Inhibition of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)-inducing transcription
factors Twist and Snail prevents tumor metastasis but enhances metastatic growth.
Here, we report an unexpected role of a tumor suppressor tristetraprolin (TTP) in
inhibiting Twist and Snail without enhancing cellular proliferation. TTP bound to the
AU-rich element (ARE) within the mRNA 3′UTRs of Twist1 and Snail1, enhanced the
decay of their mRNAs and inhibited the EMT of cancer cells. The ectopic expression
of Twist1 or Snail1 without their 3′UTRs blocked the inhibitory effects of TTP on the
EMT. We also observed that TTP overexpression suppressed the growth of cancer
cells. Our data propose a new model whereby TTP down-regulates Twist1 and Snail1
and inhibits both the EMT and the proliferation of cancer cells.

INTRODUCTION

overexpression of Twist1 or Snail1 increases the invasive
and metastatic abilities of cancer cells by promoting the
down-regulation of E-cadherin and the induction of an
EMT [8–10]. However, EMT-inducing factors can also
inhibit the proliferation of cancer cells [11–13]. Thus,
once they reach distant sites, cancer cells need to downregulate the EMT-inducing factors to allow for metastatic
growth [13]. At the transcriptional level, the expression of
EMT-inducing factors is up-regulated by developmental
signal transduction pathways, such as transforming growth
factor β (TGF-β), Notch, and fibroblast growth factor [1].
However, even though several microRNAs have been
reported to inhibit Twist1 and Snail1 mRNAs [7, 14], little
is known about the post-transcriptional regulation of these
genes.
AU-rich elements (AREs) post-transcriptionally
regulate the expression of a variety of short-lived mRNAs
such as cytokines and proto-oncogenes [15]. The stability
of ARE-containing mRNAs is regulated by ARE-binding
proteins [16]. One of the best-characterized ARE-binding

The EMT is a normal developmental program
that promotes epithelial cell dissociation and migration
to different sites during embryogenesis [1, 2]. During
cancer progression, tumor cells often gain the ability
to activate the EMT to migrate away from the primary
tumor and invade the surrounding stromal tissues
[3]. During the EMT, cells down-regulate epithelial
markers such as E-cadherin and catenins [4] and express
mesenchymal markers including N-cadherin, vimentin,
and fibronectin [5]. The EMT process is induced by a
group of transcription factors including the zinc finger
factors Snail and ZEB and the basic helix-loop-helix
factor Twist [6]. As crucial EMT inducers, Twist1 and
Snail1 are up-regulated in many types of cancer and are
associated with the increased invasive behavior of cancer
cells [7]. Twist and Snail increase the pathogenesis of
several malignant neoplasms, predominantly by enhancing
invasiveness and metastatic behavior. The exogenous

proteins is tristetraprolin (TTP), which promotes the
degradation of ARE-containing transcripts [17, 18].
TTP expression is significantly decreased in various
cancers [19]. The decreased TTP expression correlates
with the increased expression of proto-oncogenes and
may contribute to cancer processes and the re-expression
of TTP induces growth inhibitory effects [20–22].
TTP expression is induced by p53 in cancer cells [23].
However, nearly all types of cancers have abnormalities in
the p53 pathway [24], which may explain the widespread
decrease in TTP in human cancers.
We show here for the first time that the expression of
TTP led to a decrease in EMT markers and the migration
of cancer cells. TTP did not decrease the mRNA stability
of EMT markers but enhanced the mRNA degradation
of the EMT inducers Twist1 and Snail1. The exogenous
expression of either Twist1 or Snail1 without the 3ʹUTR
recovered the expression of EMT markers and cell
migration. These studies thus indicate a novel signaling
pathway by which TTP inhibits EMT and cell migration
through the down-regulation of both Twist1 and Snail1 at
the post-transcriptional level. It has been reported that the
inhibition of EMT-inducing factors promotes growth in
cancer cells [13]. However, TTP did not promote cancer
cell growth but instead suppressed cellular proliferation
through the down-regulation of genes involved in cell
proliferation such as c-fos, CDC34, and VEGF. These
findings suggest that TTP serves as a negative regulator of
both metastasis and proliferation in cancer cells.

In order to determine whether TTP inhibits the EMT,
we selected two ovarian cancer cell lines: SKOV3 with
low TTP expression and NIH:OVCAR3 with high TTP
expression. These two cell lines showed differences in
cell morphology and motility. While SKOV3 showed
an extensively flattened and elongated leading-trailing
mesenchymal morphology, NIH:OVCAR3 showed a
small epithelial morphology (Figure 1B). In addition,
SKOV3 cells migrated faster than NIH:OVCAR3 cells
in the wound healing assay (Figure 1B). We tested the
effect of TTP overexpression on the EMT. SKOV3 cells
were transfected with pcDNA6/V5-TTP (SKOV3/TTP)
or the control pcDNA/V5 vector (SKOV3/pcDNA),
and we analyzed the levels of the EMT markers by
RT-PCR, Western blot, and immunofluorescent
staining. TTP overexpression in SKOV3 cells increased
E-cadherin but decreased N-cadherin and vimentin
(Figure 2A–2C). We also determined the effects of TTP
overexpression on cell morphology and migration using
a wound healing assay, and trans-well migration and
invasion assay. The ectopic expression of TTP induced
a transition from elongated mesenchymal morphology to
small epithelial morphology (Figure 2D, top). In both the
wound healing assay and trans-well migration assay, TTP
overexpression suppressed the migration and invasion
of SKOV3 cells (Figure 2D, middle and bottom). Next,
we determined the effects of TTP inhibition on the
EMT. NIH:OVCAR3 cells were transfected with siRNA
against TTP in order to inhibit the expression of TTP,
and we analyzed for the expression of EMT markers by
RT-PCR, Western blot, and immunofluorescent staining.
The inhibition of TTP by siRNA decreased the levels
of E-cadherin but increased the levels N-cadherin
and vimentin (Figure 3A–3C). The inhibition of TTP
enhanced cell migration in the wound healing assay and
the trans-well migration and invasion assay (Figure 3D).
Collectively, our data suggest that TTP suppresses EMT
in human ovarian cancer cells.

RESULTS
TTP suppresses the mesenchymal phenotype in
cancer cells
Previously, we reported that the overexpression of
TTP suppresses cellular proliferation by enhancing the
mRNA degradation of oncogenes [20,  25]. In addition,
we found that the cancer cells that overexpressed TTP
underwent a dramatic shape change, becoming smaller and
establishing more cell-cell contacts. This prompted us to
investigate the possible role of TTP in the regulation of EMT.
We first analyzed ovarian (SKOV3 and NIH:OVCAR3),
colon (HT29), and lung (H1299) cancer cell lines for the
expression of TTP, the epithelial marker E-cadherin, and
the mesenchymal markers N-cadherin and vimentin by
RT-PCR and Western blot. The NIH:OVCAR3 and HT29
cells expressed high levels of TTP and E-cadherin but low
levels of N-cadherin and vimentin (Figure 1A). In SKOV3
and H1299 cells, the levels of TTP and E-cadherin were
low but those of N-cadherin and vimentin were high. These
data suggest that TTP expression in these cancer cell lines is
positively correlated with the epithelial marker E-cadherin
but negatively correlated with the mesenchymal markers
N-cadherin and vimentin (Figure 1A).

TTP does not affect the mRNA stabilities of
EMT markers
TTP has been reported to control gene expression
by enhancing the degradation of target mRNAs [17, 18].
To determine whether TTP affects the stability of
E-cadherin, N-cadherin, or vimentin mRNA, the halflives of these mRNAs were calculated from the mRNA
levels measured by qRT-PCR in the SKOV3 cells
transfected with pcDNA6/V5-TTP or a control pcDNA6/
V5 vector. In both the control SKOV3/pcDNA and the
SKOV3/TTP cells, these mRNAs were stable for 6 h after
actinomycin D treatment (Supplementary Figure S1),
indicating that TTP does not directly affect the expression
of the EMT markers E-cadherin, N-cadherin, or vimentin
in cancer cells.

TTP destabilizes the mRNAs of the EMTinducing transcription factors Twist1 and Snail1

both Twist1 and Snail1 (Figure 4D, 4E, and Supplementary
Figure S3). To determine whether TTP controls the stability
of Twist1 and Snail1 mRNAs, the half-lives of their
mRNAs were calculated from the mRNA levels measured
by qRT-PCR in SKOV3/TTP and SKOV3/pcDNA cells.
In the control SKOV3/pcDNA cells, both Twist1 and
Snail1 mRNAs were stable for 6 h after actinomycin D
treatment. However, in SKOV3/TTP cells, the half-lives of
Twist1 and Snail1 mRNAs decreased to 1.47 h and 1.15 h,
respectively (Figure 5A and 5B). Collectively, these results
suggest that TTP down-regulates the expression of both
Twist1 and Snail1 in cancer cells.

The expression of EMT markers is induced by EMTinducing transcription factors such as Twist1, Twist2,
Snail1, Snail2, ZEB1, and ZEB2 [6]. Thus, we hypothesized
that TTP controls the expression of EMT markers by
inhibiting the expression of EMT-inducing transcription
factors. To test this hypothesis, we analyzed the expression
of these EMT-inducing transcription factors in SKOV3/
pcDNA and SKOV3/TTP by RT-PCR and Western blot.
TTP overexpression did not decrease the expression of
Twist2, Snail2, ZEB1, or ZEB2 (Supplementary Figure S2A
and S2B). Even though the expression of Snail2 decreased
in SKOV3/TTP, the stability of Snail2 mRNA was not
decreased by TTP overexpression (Supplementary Figure
S2C). However, the expression of Twist1 and Snail1 was
reduced in SKOV3/TTP cells compared with that in
SKOV3/pcDNA cells (Figure 4A–4C). H1299 cells
with ectopic expression of TTP also showed decreased
expression of both Twist1 and Snail1 (Supplementary
Figure S3). In order to confirm whether the expression of
Twist1 and Snail1 is controlled by TTP, we determined the
effect of TTP down-regulation on the expression of these
transcription factors. NIH:OVCAR3 and HT29 cells with
high level of TTP were used for this study. The inhibition
of TTP by siRNA (TTP-siRNA) increased the expression of

[26]. Analysis of the human Twist1 and Snail1 mRNA
3ʹUTRs revealed the presence of a class I ARE and a
class II ARE in Twist1 3ʹUTR and three class I AREs in
Snail1 3ʹUTR (Figure 5C and 5E). To determine whether

TTP binds to the AUUUA motif within the Twist1
and Snail1 mRNA 3ʹUTRs

TTP is mediated through their mRNA 3ʹUTRs, we used a
luciferase reporter gene linked to Twist1 3ʹUTR containing
ARE1 (the first ARE of Twist1 3ʹUTR, class II ARE) and
ARE2 (the second ARE of Twist1 3ʹUTR, class I ARE),
Snail1 3ʹUTR containing three class I AREs (ARE1, the
first ARE; ARE2 the second ARE; ARE3, the third ARE
of Snail1 3ʹUTR) , and oligonucleotides containing the
respective AREs of Twist1 and Snail1 3ʹUTRs: OligoTwist1 ARE1, Oligo-Twist1 ARE2, Oligo-Snail1 ARE1,
Oligo-Snail1 ARE2, and Oligo-Snail1 ARE3. We also
prepared luciferase reporter genes containing mutant
oligonucleotides with each AUUUA motif of the Twist1
and Snail1 3ʹUTRs (ARE-MUT, containing AUUUA
sequences substituted with AGCA). When SKOV3 cells
were transfected to overexpress TTP, luciferase activity
from Twist1 3ʹUTR, Oligo-Twist1 ARE1, Oligo-Twist1
ARE2, Snail1 3ʹUTR, and Oligo-Snail1 ARE3  was
inhibited; however, Oligo-Snail1 ARE1 and Oligo-Snail1
ARE2  did not respond to TTP (Figure 5D and 5F). In
addition, Oligo-Twist1 ARE1-MUT and Oligo-Snail1
ARE3-MUT did not respond to TTP (Figure 5D and 5F).
The results suggest that both the first and the second
AUUUA motifs within the Twist1 3ʹUTR and the third
AUUUA motif within the Snail1 3ʹUTR are responsible
for the destabilization of Twist1 and Snail1 mRNAs,
respectively, by TTP.

To determine the binding of TTP with the ARE of
the Twist1 and Snail1 3ʹUTRs, RNA EMSA was conducted
using a biotinylated RNA probe containing the wild-type
or mutant ARE1 of Twist1 or Snail1. The RNA probes
used for RNA EMSA were the same as those used for
the luciferase assay. Cytoplasmic extracts were prepared
from SKOV3/TTP cells and incubated with biotinylated
RNA probes containing the wild-type or mutant ARE1
of the Twist1 or Snail1 3ʹUTR. When RNA EMSA was
conducted using the wild-type ARE1 probe of Twist1 or
the wild-type ARE3 of Snail1, a dominant RNA-protein
complex was observed; however, the mutant ARE1 of
Twist1 and the mutant ARE3 of Snail1 failed to form
the complex. Complex formation was neutralized in the
presence of an anti-TTP antibody (Figure 5G and 5H).
These results demonstrate that TTP binds specifically with
the AREs of Twist1 and Snail1.
To confirm the binding between TTP with the
AREs of Twist1 or Snail1 3'UTR, the ribonucleoprotein
complexes containing TTP in NIH:OVCAR3 cells were
immunoprecipitated with anti-TTP or a control antibody.
Total RNA was extracted from the immunoprecipitates
and the presence of Twist1 or Snail1 mRNA was analyzed

by RT-PCR using PCR primers specific to the Twist1
3ʹUTR or Snail1 3ʹUTR. The amplified PCR product was
observed in immunoprecipitates obtained using anti-TTP
antibody (Figure 5I). PCR product was not also detected
in immunoprecipitates obtained using control antibody.
Taken together, these data strongly suggest that the
repression of Twist1 and Snail1 occurs through the binding
of TTP with the ARE of the Twist1 and Snail1 3ʹUTRs.

Based on our results, it was speculated that TTP controls
the expression levels of EMT markers through the downregulation of Twist1 and Snail1. To confirm this hypothesis,
we co-transfected SKOV3 cells with pcDNA6/V5-TTP

and pCMV/Flag-Twist1 or pCMV/Flag-Snail1, which do
not contain a 3ʹUTR. At 24-h post-transfection, cells were
analyzed for the expression of E-cadherin, N-cadherin, and
vimentin and for cell migration. The overexpression of Twist1
or Snail1 abrogated the effect of TTP on the expression of
E-cadherin, N-cadherin, and vimentin (Figure 6A and 6B).
In addition, the overexpression of Twist1 or Snail1 restored
the migration and the invasion of SKOV3 cells (Figure 6C).
These results indicate that TTP suppresses the EMT through
the down-regulation of the EMT inducers Twist1 or Snail1 in
cancer cells.

TTP-inducer inhibits EMT in cancer cells. Previously, we
have reported that the DNA-damaging agent doxorubicin
(DOX) induces the expression of TTP in a p53-dependent
manner [23]. Thus, we hypothesized that DOX induces
TTP expression, which in turn decreases the expression of
EMT markers. To test this hypothesis, we used p53 wildtype PA1 ovarian cancer cells instead of p53  mutant
NIH:OVCAR3 and SKOV3 cells. PA1 cells were treated
with DOX for 24  h and analyzed for the expression of
TTP and EMT markers. High concentration of DOX is
toxic to cells and thus we used low concentration of DOX
(0.3 μg/ml) to prevent DOX-induced cell death. As shown
in Supplementary Figure S6A, DOX treatment increased
the expression of TTP and E-cadherin but decreased the
levels of Twist1, N-cadherin, and vimentin. DOX treatment
did not decrease the mRNA stability of E-cadherin,
N-cadherin, and vimentin but enhanced the degradation of
Twist1 mRNA (Supplementary Figure S6B). In addition,
DOX treatment inhibited cellular migration in the wound
healing assay (Supplementary Figure S6C). These results
suggest that the TTP inducer DOX can inhibit the EMT in
cancer cells.

TTP level is high in the epithelium but low in the
mesenchyme of human tissues
Previously we reported that TTP level is high in
normal tissues but significantly reduced in tumor stage I
and remains at very low levels in advanced stages
of human colonic adenocarcinoma [20] and ovarian
adenocarcinoma [25]. Based on our results, it was
speculated that TTP level is high in the normal epithelium
but low in the normal mesenchyme. To confirm this
hypothesis, we determined the expression levels of TTP
in normal human ovarian tissues and colonic mucosa by
immunohistochemistry. Consistent with our hypothesis,
we found that, while normal ovarian tissues and normal
colonic mucosa demonstrated strong TTP staining of
the surface epithelium and the mesenchyme of normal
ovarian tissues and colonic mucosa was negative for TTP
(Supplementary Table S2 and Supplementary Figure S4).

TTP inhibits the growth of ovarian cancer cells
The inhibition of EMT-inducing factors has been
reported to promote cancer cell growth [13]. We tested
whether TTP overexpression enhances the growth of
cancer cells. Consistent with our previous reports [20, 25],
the ectopic expression of TTP inhibited the growth of
SKOV3 cells (Figure 7A). RT-PCR analysis revealed a
decreased expression of c-fos, CDC34, and VEGF in TTPoverexpressing SKOV3 cells (Figure 7B). On the contrary,
the inhibition of TTP by siRNA (Figure 7C) enhanced the
growth of NIH:OVCAR3 cells (Figure 7D). These results
indicate that TTP inhibits the expression of oncogenes as
well as the EMT-inducing factors Twist1 and Snail1 and
suppresses both the growth and metastasis of cancer cells.

TGF-β does not decrease the expression of TTP
in cancer cells
Transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) has been
reported to induce EMT in cancer cells [27] and induce
TTP expression [28, 29]. Thus, we tested whether TGF-β
induces EMT by modulating TTP expression in cancer
cells. We found that TGF-β inhibited the expression of
E-cadherin and enhanced the expression of Twist1, Snail1,
and N-cadherin in A549 cells (Supplementary Figure S5).
To determine whether these factors induce these
changes by inhibiting TTP, A549 cells were incubated
in the presence of TGF-β for 24 h and analyzed for the
expression of TTP. However, TGF-β treatment did not
decrease the expression of TTP (Supplementary Figure
S5A and S5B). In addition, we found that TGF-β treatment
did not enhance the mRNA stability of Twist1, E-cadherin,
N-cadherin, and vimentin (Supplementary Figure S5C).
These results suggest that TTP does not mediate the TGFβ-induced EMT in cancer cells.

DISCUSSION
Previously TTP has been reported to be involved
in tumor metastasis [30, 31]. However, the underlying
mechanism remains unknown. The present study identified
TTP, a RNA-binding protein that inhibits the EMT
in human cancer cells. TTP overexpression in human
cancer cells also increased the levels of the epithelial
marker E-cadherin but decreased the mesenchymal
markers N-cadherin and vimentin. Conversely, the
inhibition of TTP by siRNA decreased the E-cadherin
level but increased N-cadherin and vimentin levels. We
also observed that TTP overexpression suppresses cell
migration, while TTP inhibition enhances it. In normal
human tissues, the levels of TTP expression were high
in the epithelium but extremely low in the mesenchyme.
Together, this evidence leads us to propose that TTP is a
negative regulator of the EMT.

that TTP down-regulates Twist1 and Snail1 expression
in cancer cells, suggesting the possibility that TTP may
inhibit the expression of EMT marker genes through
enhancing the degradation of Twist1 and Snail1 mRNAs.
Here, we provided evidence supporting this hypothesis:
overexpression of TTP decreased mRNA stability and

TTP has been reported to inhibit gene expression
at the post-transcriptional level through enhancing the
degradation of ARE-containing mRNAs [17, 18]. If EMT
markers such as E-cadherin, N-cadherin, and vimentin are
target genes of TTP in cancer cells, TTP might decrease
the stability of the mRNA of these genes. However, we
found that TTP did not decrease the stability of these
mRNAs, bringing into question the identities of the
targets of TTP in regulating the EMT phenotype. The
expression of EMT marker genes is controlled by several
EMT inducers such as Twist1, Twist2, Snail1, Snail2,
ZEB1, and ZEB2 [6]. In this study, we demonstrated

the expression of a luciferase reporter gene containing the
3ʹUTR of Twist1 or Snail1. Our results indicate that TTP
down-regulates Twist1 and Snail1 expression at the posttranscriptional level by enhancing the degradation of their
mRNAs in order to inhibit EMT marker gene expression
and the EMT phenotype.
As crucial EMT inducers, Twist1 and Snail1 are
up-regulated in many types of cancer and are associated
with increased invasive behavior in cancer cells [7].
Twist1 and Snail1 are up-regulated by a wide range of
signaling pathways [1]. Among them, TGF-β is one of the
most prominent EMT-inducing cytokines that activate an
array of EMT inducers [32]. In this study, we demonstrated
that TTP inhibits the expression of Twist1 and Snail1 in
human cancer cells. TTP expression has been reported
to be inhibited in a variety of human cancer cells [19],
which may cause a high level of Twist1 and Snail1 to be
expressed in cancer cells. However, it is not likely that an
EMT inducer such as TGF-β is responsible for the low
TTP levels in cancer cells since TGF-β has been reported
to induce TTP expression [28,  29] and enhance TTP
activity [33]. In addition, we did not observe any changes

in TTP expression in the cancer cells that had undergone
an EMT upon stimulation with TGF-β. Previously, we
have identified p53 to be a key transcription factor in
inducing TTP expression in human cancer cells [23]. The
DNA-damaging agent doxorubicin has been reported to
induce the expression of TTP in p53 wild-type cancer cells
[23]. In this study, we observed that doxorubicin enhanced
the TTP level and decreased Twist1 and Snail1 levels
in p53  wild-type cancer cells. This suggests that the
re-expression of TTP inhibits the EMT through the downregulation of Twist1 and Snail1. Until now, it has been
reported that TTP expression is controlled by signaling
pathways involving phorbol ester, insulin, serum, and
other mitogenic stimuli [34–38]. Therefore, future studies
are needed to identify TTP inducers that contribute to the
down-regulation of EMT-inducing factors and metastasis.
Cancer cells undergoing EMT are often growtharrested since EMT-inducing factors can inhibit the
proliferation of cancer cells [11–13]. Thus, once reaching
distant sites, cancer cells need to down-regulate EMTinducing factors to allow for metastatic growth. The
underlying mechanisms, however, are largely unknown.

Cell migration and invasion assays

If TTP expression is enhanced during cancer progression,
it is possible that TTP is responsible for the deactivation
of EMT-inducing factors that support metastatic growth.
However, the enhanced expression of TTP has not been
observed during cancer progression [20, 25], suggesting
that TTP may not be responsible for the deactivation of
EMT-inducing factors to promote metastatic growth.
Here, we found that, in normal tissues, TTP level is high
in the epithelium but low in the mesenchyme. In this
normal epithelium, TTP may suppress the EMT through
down-regulation of EMT-inducing factors such as Twist1
and Snail1. However, the deactivation of Twist1 and
Snail1 may not lead to enhanced cellular proliferation
since TTP can inhibit growth through the down-regulation
of cancer-associated genes [39, 40]. Consistent with these
previous studies, we found that high levels of TTP induced
by ectopic expression or doxorubicin treatment inhibited
the proliferation of cancer cells. Collectively, our results
suggest that TTP in the epithelium suppresses the EMT
through the down-regulation of EMT-inducing factors
such as Twist1 and Snail1 without enhancing cellular
proliferation.
In conclusion, we determined that TTP suppresses
the EMT of human cancer cells through the destabilization
of Twist1 and Snail1  mRNAs. These findings, coupled
with recent evidence demonstrating the benefits of EMT
in cancer metastasis [1], suggest that pharmacologic
activation of TTP and/or the induction of TTP expression
may limit EMT and cancer metastasis. Therapeutic agents
that inhibit EMT have been proposed as a treatment option
against tumor metastasis [41]. However, such an approach
could promote metastatic growth when patients present
with circulating cancer cells. TTP can suppress both EMT
and cellular proliferation through the down-regulation
of EMT-inducing factors and cancer-related genes,
respectively. Thus, the TTP pathway could represent a new
therapeutic target to prevent both metastasis and cellular
proliferation.

A wound-healing assay was conducted using
a culture-insert (ibidi, 80209) according to the
manufacturerʹs instruction. After 24 h, the culture insert
was removed, leaving gaps (approx. 500 µm) in the sheets
of cells. The area devoid of cells was analyzed after 12 or
24 h using a Carl Zeiss microscope (OLYMPUS, CK30).
For the trans-well migration assay, cells were resuspended in serum-free medium and seeded into the
trans-well inserts of a 24-well plate (BD Biosciences,
#3422) for 24 h. The culture medium containing 10%
fetal bovine serum was placed in the lower chamber
as a chemoattractant. After incubation for 24 h, nonmigrated cells were scraped off the upper surface of the
membrane with a cotton swab. Migrated cells remaining
on the bottom surface were counted after staining with
crystal violet (0.5% in 20% methanol). The invasion
assay was performed under the same conditions using
growth factor-reduced matrigel-coated insert wells (BD
Biosciences, #356234). Values for cell migration or
invasion were expressed as the average number of cells
per microscopic field over four fields per one filter for
triplicate experiments, as described previously.

Plasmids, siRNAs, transfections, and dualluciferase assay
The pcDNA6/V5-TTP construct was described
previously [25]. The plasmid construct pCMV/FlagTwist1 was kindly provided by Dr. Kou-Juey Wu (Institute
of Biochemistry and Mol Biology, National YangMing University, Taiwan) and pCMV/Flag-Snail1  was
purchased from Addgene. Cells were transfected with
plasmid constructs using TurboFect™ in vitro transfection
reagent (Thermo Scientific, R0531).
Small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) against human
TTP (TTP-siRNA, sc-36760) and control siRNA (scRNA,
sc-44230) were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology
(Santa Cruz). 2 × 106 cells were transfected 24 h after
plating with 60 pmol siRNA using Lipofectamine™
RNAiMAX (Invitrogen) and were harvested after 48 h.
The expression levels of TTP or EMT marker mRNAs and
proteins were analyzed by RT-PCR or Western blot.
Full length of Twist1 3ʹUTR and Snail1 3ʹUTR
containing all AUUUA motifs of each 3ʹUTRs were PCR
amplified from cDNA of SKOV3 cells using the following
primer sets: Twist1–3ʹUTR-U, Twist1–3ʹUTR-D,
Snail1–3ʹUTR-U, and Snail1–3ʹUTR-D (Supplementary
Table  S1). Two oligonucleotides containing the first
(Oligo-Twist1 ARE1) and the second AUUUA pentamers
(Oligo-Twist1 ARE2) within the Twist1 3ʹUTR and three
oligonucleotides containing the first (Oligo-Snail1 ARE1),
second (Oligo-Snail1 ARE2), and third AUUUA pentamers
(Oligo-Snail1 ARE3) within the Snail1 3ʹUTR were

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell culture
Human ovarian (SKOV3, NIH:OVCAR3, PA1),
colon (HT29), and lung (H1299, A549) cancer cell
lines were purchased from the Korean Cell Line Bank
(KCLB-Seoul, Korea). Cells were cultured in RPMI1
1640 media, supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum
(WELGENE, Korea), and were maintained at 37°C in a
humidified at atmosphere of 5% CO2. To determine the
effect of TGF-β on TTP expression and the EMT, cells
were incubated with 10  ng/ml human TGF-β (Sigma,
SRP3170) for 24 h. For the induction of TTP, cells were
treated with 0.3  μg/ml Doxorubicin (DOX) (Sigma,
D1515) for 24 h.

IA, USA). Mutant oligonucleotides in which the AUUUA
pentamer was substituted with AGCA (Oligo-ARE
MUT) were also synthesized (Supplementary Table S1).
The oligonuclotides were ligated into the XhoI/NotI site of
the psiCHECK2 Renilla/firefly dual-luciferase expression
vector (Promega, Madison, WI, USA).
For the luciferase assays, 2 × 106 cells were
co-transfected with 0.5  μg various psiCHECK2-Twist1
3ʹUTR and psiCHECK2-Snail1 3ʹUTR constructs and
0.5 μg pcDNA6/V5-TTP using the TurboFect™ in vitro
transfection reagent (Thermo Scientific, R0531).
Transfected cells were lysed with lysis buffer and mixed
with luciferase assay reagent (Promega, 017757), and the
chemiluminescent signal was measured in a SpectraMax
L Microplate (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA, USA).
Firefly luciferase was normalized to Renilla luciferase in
each sample. All luciferase assays reported here represent
at least three independent experiments, each consisting of
three wells per transfection.

biotinylated RNA was combined with 5 μg of cytoplasmic
protein from cell extracts in binding buffer. For the
supershift EMSA, rabbit anti-human TTP polyclonal
antibody (Sigma, T5327) or control antibody (Sigma,
T3581) was added to the reaction mixture. After addition
of the antibodies, the reaction mixtures were incubated
overnight on ice and resolved on 5% non-denaturing
polyacrylamide gels in 0.5X Tris borate/EDTA buffer.
Gels were transferred to a nylon membrane (Hybond™-N+)
in 0.5x Tris borate/EDTA at 70V for 40 min. Transferred
RNAs were cross-linked to the membrane and detected
using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin
(LightShift™ Chemiluminescent EMSA kit) according to
the manufacturer’s instructions.

RNP immunoprecipitation assay
To determine the binding between TTP and Twist1
or Snail1 AREs, RNP immunoprecipitation assay was
conducted by modification of previously describe [25].
Briefly, cell suspension of NIH:OVCAR3was was
incubated in 1% of formaldehyde for 20 min at room
temperature. The reaction was stopped with 0.25 M of
glycin (pH 7.0), and cells were sonicated in modified RIPA
buffer containing protease inhibitors (Roche, Indianapolis,
IN, USA). RNP complexes were immunoprecipitated using
protein G-agarose beads preincubated with 1 μg of anti-TTP
(Sigma) or 1 μg of isotype control (Sigma, St Louis, MO,
USA). After crosslinking reversion at 70 oC for 45 min,
RNA was isolated from the immunoprecipitates and treated
with DNAse I (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA). cDNA was
synthesized from the RNA and Twist1 3ʹUTR and Snail1
3ʹUTR were amplified by PCR using Taq polymerase
(Solgent, Daejeon, Korea) and primers (Twist1 UPCCGCTCGAGCTGGCCTGCAAAAC, Twist1 DOWN-A

Cell viability/proliferation
For the MTS cell proliferation assay, cells were
plated in triplicate at 1.0 ×  104 cells/well in 96-well
culture plates in culture media. At 24 or 48 h after plating,
CellTiter 96® AQueous One Solution cell proliferation
assay (Promega, 3580) was added to each well according
to the manufacturerʹs instructions, and absorbance at
490 nm was determined for each well using a Victor 1420
Multilabel Counter (EG&G Wallac, Turku, Finland).
