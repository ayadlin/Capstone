ABSTRACT
While the molecular chaperone heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) is involved in a
multitude of physiological and pathological processes, its role relating to pulmonary
arterial hypertension (PAH) remains unclear. In the present study, we investigated
the effect in which HSP90 improves pulmonary arteriole remodeling, and explored
the therapeutic utility of targeting HSP90 as therapeutic drug for PAH. By Elisa
and immunohistochemistry, HSP90 was found to be increased in both plasma and
membrane walls of pulmonary arterioles from PAH patients. Moreover, plasma HSP90
levels positively correlated with mean pulmonary arterial pressure and C-reactive
protein. In a monocrotaline-induced rat model of PH, we found that 17-AAG, a HSP90inhibitor, alleviated the progress of PH, demonstrated by lower pulmonary arterial
pressure and absence of right ventricular hypertrophy. Immunohistochemical staining
demonstrated that 17-AAG improved pulmonary arteriole remodeling on the basis of
reduced wall thickness and wall area. The inflammatory response attributed to PH
could be attenuated by 17-AAG through reduction of NF-κB signaling. Moreover, 17AAG was found to suppress PDGF-stimulated proliferation and migration of pulmonary
artery smooth muscle cells (PASMCs) through induction of cell cycle arrest in the G1
phase. In conclusion, HSP90 inhibitor 17-AAG could improve pulmonary arteriole
remodeling via inhibiting the excessive proliferation of PASMCs, and inhibition of
HSP90 may represent a therapeutic avenue for the treatment of PAH.

INTRODUCTION

artery smooth muscle cells (PASMCs) in the medial layer
of pulmonary arteries may be among the most prominent
feature of PAH [3, 4].
Heat shock protein 90 (HSP90), an ubiquitous
chaperones, is involved in numerous physiological and
pathological processes, especially in cancers [5]. HSP90
plays important roles in cell division by regulating
maturation of signaling proteins including: kinases,
steroid hormone receptors and key oncogenic proteins
[6-8]. Recently, HSP90 inhibitor, 17-allylamino-17demethoxygeldamycin (17-AAG), was demonstrated

Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is clinically
characterized by pulmonary arteriole contraction resulting
in chronic elevation of pulmonary vascular resistance,
right ventricular remodeling, dysfunction and ultimately
failure [1, 2]. While the pathogenesis of PAH is not fully
characterized, pulmonary vasoconstriction, vascular
remodeling and in-situ thrombosis formation are believed
to represent central components of the pathobiology. It has
been reported that the extensive proliferation of pulmonary

Elevation of HSP90 levels in plasma and lung
tissue of patients with PAH

to attenuate formation of atherosclerotic plaques by
reducing inflammatory responses and suppress migration
and proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells [9, 10].
Herein, we detected the expression of HSP90 in CHD
patients with PAH, investigated the impact of 17-AAG
on pulmonary arteriole remodeling and PASMCs growth,
and explored the potential utility of HSP90 inhibitors as
therapeutic avenue for PAH.

It has been previously demonstrated that the level
of plasma Hsp90α positively correlates with tumor
malignancy [11]. Therefore, we evaluated HSP90α
expression in plasma from the three groups. Plasma
HSP90α levels were significantly higher in patients
with PAH as compared to CHD-only and control groups
(11.36±5.67 ng/mL vs 6.24±1.99 ng/mL and 6.17±2.98 ng/
mL, P < 0.05). There was no difference between CHD
and control groups (Figure 1A). Receiver Operating
Characteristic (ROC), applied on data from all donors,
demonstrated that HSP90α reflected strong separation
between PAH and non-PAH groups, with an area under
curve (AUC) of 0.864 (95% confidence interval 0.7900.939, Figure 1B). Correlation analysis between HSP90α
plasma content and clinical parameters was performed on
the PAH group. Spearman correlation test demonstrated
that plasma HSP90α level positively correlated with mPAP
(rs = 0.444, P < 0.05) and CRP (rs = 0.587, P < 0.01). No
associations with other clinical parameters were observed
(Figure 1C and Table S1). We also collected lung tissue
from CHD patients with PAH (n = 11) and normal lung
tissue from autopsy (n = 3). In CHD patients with PAH, a
thicker wall and cell proliferative medial membrane were
observed by hematoxylin-eosin staining in the pulmonary
arteriole. Immunohistochemistry analysis detected HSP90

RESULTS
Patients characteristics
Plasma from 27 CHD patients with PAH (3 patients
with atrial septal defects, 15 patients with ventricular
septal defects, 6 patients with patent ductus arteriosus, 2
patients with coronary artery fistula, 1 patient with doubleoutlet right ventricle with mitral atresia), 39 CHD patients
without PAH (all with left-to-right shunting), and 23
healthy control, were analyzed. Demographic, laboratory,
clinical, and hemodynamic data are summarized in
Table 1. Invasive hemodynamics was not obtained in
the control group. The majority of patients were WHO
functional Class I or Class II, and had not received any
pharmacological treatment. There were no significant
differences in the age or gender composition of the three
groups (P > 0.05).

patients with PAH, while no expression was observed in
normal lung tissue (Figure 1D). These results suggest that
HSP90 might be involved in the progress of PAH.

of pulmonary arterioles from MCT group in spite of the
overall reduction in the lung tissue (Figure S1). To test
whether inhibition of HSP90 impacted the development
of PH, we evaluated the effect of 17-AAG using a
monocrotaline (MCT)-induced PH rat model. While
no animals died during the modeling stage (3 weeks
after MCT injection), in the treatment stage (3 weeks
after 17-AAG injection) 80% of animals (24/30) died
of heart failure in the MCT group, while only 63.3% of
animals (19/30) died in the 17-AAG group (Figure 2A).
To understand the cause of these findings, right heart
catheterization was performed on the surviving rats from
each group. Compared with controls, rats in MCT group
exhibited significant increase in mPAP (Control group:

MCT group: 56.5±4.0 mmHg, P < 0.01). Treatment with
17-AAG significantly reduced the mPAP (35.70±4.43
mmHg, P < 0.05 vs MCT group) and RVSP (47.5±5.8
mmHg, P < 0.05 vs MCT group, Figure 2B). Histological
staining of right ventricle in the MCT group revealed
disorganized myocardial cells as compared to the control
group. Notably, 17-AAG treatment effectively alleviated
these structural changes (Figure 2C). The right ventricle
hypertrophy index in MCT group was significantly
increased compared with control group (0.482±0.05 vs
0.230±0.03, P < 0.01), but apparently fell in the 17-AAGtreated group (0.383±0.04, P < 0.05 vs MCT group, Figure
2D).

of the pulmonary artery’s tunica media and alveolar
septum, stenosis of the arterial lumen could be observed
in MCT group. Treatment with 17-AAG significantly
alleviated these changes (Figure 3A). Image J software
was used to measure the parameter of the pulmonary
arterioles, including the internal/external diameter and
the area of vessel/lumen (Table S2), to calculate the wall
thickness percentage (WT%) and wall area percentage
(WA%). When compared against the control group
(WT%: 10.97±3.34%, WA%: 20.61±5.85%), there were
remarkable increase on WT% (37.81±10.56%) and WA%
(60.30±11.94%) in the MCT group (P < 0.01 respectively).
However, 17-AAG treatment markedly reduced the
increase in both WT% (26.16±13.59%) and WA%
(50.07±9.55%) (P < 0.01 vs MCT group respectively),
although still remained significantly elevated compared
with those of the control group (P < 0.05 respectively,
Figure 3B).

Inhibition of HSP90 decreased inflammatory
signaling pathways in PH

Pulmonary arteriole remodeling is an important
element of the pathogenesis of PH. Therefore, microscopic
analysis of structure characteristic was performed on
paraffin sections of rat lung tissues after 6 weeks of MCT
injection. The pulmonary arterial walls in control group
presented clearly with high integrity and normal arterial
tunica media thickness. However, thickening and swelling

Considering the positive correlation between

Inhibition of HSP90 prevented PASMCs
proliferation and migration induced by PDGF-bb

TNF-α, and IL-1 levels were notably increased in the MCT
group (P < 0.01), while the levels approached baseline
in rats treated with 17-AAG (P < 0.05 vs MCT group
respectively, Figure 4A). We evaluated NF-κB signaling
and the expression of anti-inflammatory HSP70 on rat
lung tissues by immunohistochemistry. When compared
with the MCT group, 17-AAG-treated rats showed weaker
staining for NF-κB p65, and weaker nuclear staining for
phosphorylated NF-κB p65. It is confused that the staining
for HSP70 was also detected weaker in 17-AAG-treated
group (Figure 4B and Table S3). Nevertheless, these
results suggest that 17-AAG might suppress inflammation
by decreasing NF-κB signaling and upregulating of HSP70
expression in PAH.

Since excessive proliferation and migration of
PASMCs is a central pathologic feature of pulmonary
vascular remodeling in PH, we investigated the effect
of HSP90 inhibitor on PASMCs growth. Microscope
observation showed that PASMCs growth were
significantly inhibited in 17-AAG treated groups (Figure
5A). CCK-8 cell viability assay demonstrated an increase
of ~1.6-fold following 24-hours of PDGF-bb stimulation,
whereas 17-AAG caused a reduction irrespective of
stimulation (P < 0.01, Figure 5B). Western blot assay
also indicated that protein expressions of proliferating

by 17-AAG both in control and PDGF-stimulated groups
(Figure 5C). However, flow cytometry assay was unable
to detect any significant change in apoptosis induced by
17-AAG (Figure S2). Furthermore, 17-AAG-treatment
displayed a strong inhibitory effect on PASMCs migration

(Figure 5D). Taken together, these results suggest that
HSP90 inhibition can suppress proliferation and migration
of PASMCs, thereby improving pulmonary arteriole
remodeling of PAH.

expression

HSP90 and the co-chaperone adaptor CDC37. As such,
we assessed expression changes of these genes by realtime PCR and western blot analysis. While no significant
changes in mRNA levels were observed, CDK4 protein
levels significantly decreased after 17-AAG treatment
both in basal and PDGF groups (Figure 6B and 6C).
Correspondingly, the protein levels of CCND1 were also
significantly decreased in the 17-AAG-treated groups,
but similarly mRNA levels were unaffected (Figure 6D
and 6E). CDK4 co-chaperone adaptor CDC37 protein
expression was unchanged by 17-AAG treatment (Figure
S3). These results demonstrate that HSP90-inhibition
induced cell cycle arrest by modulating the stability of cell
cycle regulatory proteins.

HSP90 had been reported to impact the cell cycle
of VSMCs in atherosclerosis progression, and as such
we proceeded to investigate the impact of 17-AAGtreatment on cell cycle progression in PASMCs. Flow
cytometry analysis identified an increasing G1 phasecell population (70.5±3.5% to 81.8±5.2%, P < 0.05)
and decreased the S phase-cell population (25.9±2.2%
to 13.9±4.4%, P < 0.05) in 17-AAG-treated cells in a
PDGF-bb-stimulated environment. No significant changes
were induced by 17-AAG in the basal group (Figure 6A).
Progression of the cell cycle is strictly controlled by
cyclins and cyclin-dependent kinases, including cyclindependent kinase 4 (CDK4), which may be affected by

DISCUSSION

normal condition, and the PCNA expression was decreased
by 17-AAG in a control setting. The emergence of more
potent and water soluble derivative, such as 17-DMAG or
IPI-504, might improve the utility of HSP90 inhibitors as
therapeutic drug.
Given that HSP90 can be found in the extracellular
environment, the plasma HSP90α level positively
correlated with tumor malignancy and metastasis [11, 18].
Our results demonstrated that plasma HSP90αlevels were
elevated compared with those from CHD patients without
PAH and healthy controls. Moreover, HSP90α positively
correlated with mPAP and CRP. ROC analysis further
indicated that HSP90α might be a potential biomarker for
PAH diagnosis. It should be noted that plasma HSP90α
levels in PAH patients were still far less than those levels
observed in cancer patients.

It is well established that heat shock proteins are
involved in regulation of many signaling pathways, which
are crucial to normal development and the pathobiology of
numerous disease states. As such, application of a HSP90
inhibitors as therapeutic drugs for PAH treatment, might
affect other pathological and physiological processes, such
as oxidative stress or neoangiogenesis [14, 15]. Further
studies are required to clarify the value of HSP90 inhibitor
as a treatment avenue for PAH. Although clinical trials
in cancer patients had indicated that the combination of
HSP90 inhibitors with other drugs display acceptable
toxicity levels [16, 17], our results showed that 17-AAG
caused a remarkable reduction on PASMCs growth in

The inflammatory response plays an important
role in the development of PAH [19]. Our result from
clinical and animal experiments showed that 17-AAG
might reduce the inflammatory response in PAH by
inhibiting HSP90 activity. Although it was reported that
immunosuppression was invalid for PAH, our results
suggest that early anti-inflammatory treatment might
be effective for improvement of pulmonary arterioles
remodeling. However, whether the pulmonary benefit
observed after 17-AAG treatment was related to a
local or systemic effect remained unclear. Based on the
contribution of HSP90 to inflammation, the effect of
17-AAG treatment should be the systemic effect for the
pulmonary benefit.
The present work has led us to conclude that
HSP90-inhibition may represent an effective treatment
avenue for PAH therapy. Currently, HSP90 inhibitor
therapy is plagued by numerous challenges relating
to bioavailability, toxicity and stability. Moreover, the
molecular mechanisms and the drug sensitivity genes
have not been entirely elucidated. Development of more
efficient and specific HSP90 inhibitors would promise new
therapy strategy for many diseases in future.

subcutaneous injection of 17-AAG (30 mg/kg, Sigma)
every 2 days for 21 days after MCT injection. Similar
treatment schedules were used for mock (saline)-treated
control and MCT groups.
The animal work performed in this study was
approved by institutional review board of the local
university, and the experiment protocols were carried
out according to the guidelines for the care and use
of laboratory animals established by the US National
Institutes of Health.

Right heart catheterization
Rats were anesthetized intraperitoneally with chloral
hydrate (300 mg/kg). A PE-50 silicone catheter (0.9 mm
outer diameter) was introduced into the right jugular vein,
passing through right atrium, the tricuspid valve and right
ventricle, and into the pulmonary artery. A multichannel
physiologic recorder (BIOPAC) was connected to the
other end of the catheter. The position of the catheter
was determined by the typical wave form of the pressure.
The systolic pulmonary artery pressure (sPAP) and
diastolic pulmonary artery pressure (dPAP) were recorded
simultaneously.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Right ventricular hypertrophy index (RVHI)
Study populations

After measuring pulmonary vascular hemodynamics,
the rats were sacrificed by CO2 inhalation followed by
cervical dislocation. Tissues and organ (heart, lung, liver,
and kidney) were isolated. The right ventricle (RV) wall
was dissected from the left ventricle (LV) and ventricular
septum (S). The wet weight of the RV and LV+S was
determined respectively, and RVHI was calculated as the
weight ratio of RV/(LV+S).

All PAH patients enrolled in this study received
treatment for CHD at Department of Cardiovascular
Surgery or Department of Cardiology in Changhai
Hospital between July 2013 and February 2014. PAH
diagnoses was made following right heart catheterization,
and an evaluation of the diagnostic criteria as reported by
the 5th World Symposium in France in 2013 [2]. Patients
with cancer, infection, fever, trauma or stress were
excluded from this study. Age- and sex-matched CHD
patients without PAH (mPAP < 18 mmHg), and healthy
volunteers without history of cardiovascular disease were
recruited as a control group.
This study was carried out in accordance to the
principles of the Declaration of Helsinki and approved
by the Medical Ethics Committee in Shanghai Changhai
Hospital. Written informed consent was obtained from all
the participants prior to enrollment.

Wall thickness (WT) and wall area (WA)
The left lungs were embedded in paraffin after
fixation by 4% paraformaldehyde, and the sections (5 μm)

were stained with Hematoxylin-Eosin. Ten pulmonary
arterioles were examined for structural integrity using
Image J software. WT, WA, vessel diameter, the average
vessel area and lumen area were determined.

Immunohistochemistry

Animal model of PH

The deparaffinized and rehydrated sections were
incubated in warm citric acid/sodium citrate buffer (pH
6.0) for antigen retrieval. After blocking the endogenous
peroxidases, the sections were incubated with the primary
antibodies overnight followed by incubation with HRPconjugated secondary antibody. Negative controls using
the corresponding IgG for checking non-specific staining.

Ninety male Sprague-Dawley rats, weighing from
200 to 250 g, were randomly divided into three groups:
Control, MCT and 17-AAG groups. PH was induced by
a single subcutaneous injection of monocrotaline (MCT,
50 mg/kg, Sigma), while control rats were injected
with normal saline. In the 17-AAG group, rats were

Fisher’s exact test. The quantitative data was first
evaluated whether they followed the normal distribution
by the Shapiro-Wilk test. The data of non-normal
distribution was performed by Kruskal-Wallis test. The
data of normal distribution was further performed by
Levene’s test for homogeneity of variance analyses. Oneway ANOVA was performed to assess the homogeneity
of variance, and Kruskal-Wallis test was performed on
the data that did not meet the homogeneity of variance.
Relationship between levels of HSP90 and other clinical
parameters were analyzed by Spearman test. Receiver
operating characteristic (ROC) curves were established for
discriminating PAH patients from the ones with CHD. All
P-values are two-sided and less than 0.05 was considered
statistically significant difference.

Male Sprague-Dawley rats were sacrificed by CO2
inhalation followed by cervical dislocation. Pulmonary
artery smooth muscle cells (PASMCs) were obtained by
collagenase digestion of pulmonary artery and cultured
in Dulbecco modified Eagle medium supplemented with
10% fetal bovine serum. PASMCs (passage 4-6) were
seeded in plates, and stimulated by PDGF-bb (10 ng/mL)
with or without 17-AAG (1 μmol/L). Cells were harvested
after 24 hours for further observation and analysis.

Flow cytometry for cell cycle and apoptosis
For cell cycle analysis, PASMCs were fixed with
cold 70% ethanol, and incubated in staining solution
(20 μg/mL propidium iodide and 50 μg/mL RNase A
in phosphate-buffered saline) at room temperature for
30 minutes. For detection of apoptosis, PASMCs were
harvested and stained by Annexin V/propidium iodide
at room temperature for 15 minutes. All samples were
analyzed using FACSort flow cytometer and Cell Quest
Pro (BD).

PrimeScript RT reagent Kit (TAKARA) with oligo-dT
and random primer. Real-time PCR was performed on a
LightCycler 480 II quantitative PCR system (Roche) using
SYBR Green. Primers used in the amplification reaction
were in Table S3.

Protein was extracted from PASMCs by RIPA buffer
plus protease inhibitors. Normalized amounts of protein
(about 30 μg) was separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred
to the PVDF membrane. After blocking by 5% non-fat
milk in phosphate-buffered saline with 0.1% Tween 20, the
membrane was incubated with diluted primary antibodies
overnight followed by incubation with HRP-conjugated
secondary antibody. Proteins were visualized by ECL
Plus Western Blotting Substrate (Thermo Scientific) on
ImageQuant LAS500 (GE). α-tubulin was detected as
loading control.
