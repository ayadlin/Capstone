ABSTRACT
Uterine leiomyomas (UL) are the most prevalent symptomatic human tumors at
all and somatic mutations of the gene encoding mediator subcomplex 12 (MED12)
constitute the most frequent driver mutations in UL. Recently, a rapid loss of mutated
cells during in vitro growth of UL-derived cell cultures was reported, resulting in
doubts about the benefits of UL-derived cell cultures. To evaluate if the rapid loss
of MED12-mutated cells in UL cell cultures depends on in vitro passaging, we set up
cell cultures from nine UL from 40–50 year old Caucasian patients with at least one
UL. Cultured UL cells were investigated for loss of MED12-mutated cells. Genetic
characterization of native tumor samples and adjacent myometrium was done by
array analysis. “Aged” primary cultures without passaging were compared to cells
of three subsequent passages. Comparative analyses of the mutated/non-mutated
ratios between native tissue, primary cells, and cultured tumor cells revealed a clear
decrease of MED12-mutated cells. None of the tumors showed gross alterations of
the array profiles, excluding the presence of gross genomic imbalances besides the
MED12 mutations as a reason for the intertumoral variation in the loss of MED12mutated cells. Albeit at a lesser rate, loss of MED12-mutated cells from cell cultures
of UL occurs even without passaging thus indicating the requirement of soluble
factors or matrix components lacking in vitro. Identification of these factors can help
to understand the mechanisms of the growth of the most frequent type of uterine
leiomyomas and to decipher novel drug targets.

INTRODUCTION

mammalian species in particular in the region encoded
by the UL-hotspot region [8]. While UL-derived cell
cultures are a wide-spread model system for research into
the pathogenesis and behavior of the tumors [2, 9–11]
recent results challenge the usefulness of this model
for the group of tumors carrying MED12 mutations.
Contrary to the expectations a rapid loss of mutated cells
accompanied in vitro growth of UL-derived cell cultures
[12]. As a rule, the mutations were not even detectable
after early passages of in vitro growth resulting from
so far unknown mechanisms. One possible explanation
is a decreased growth potential resulting from in vitro
passaging. However, an in depth understanding of the

Uterine leiomyomas (UL) are the most prevalent
symptomatic human tumors at all constituting a major
public health problem [1, 2].
Nevertheless, there is a surprising gap of knowledge
on the pathobiology of these frequent tumors. Current
data strongly suggest that particular somatic mutations
of the gene encoding mediator subcomplex 12 (MED12)
constitute the most frequent driver mutations in UL
[3–7]. Mediator subcomplex 12 is a protein involved in
the organisation of the transcription machinery showing
a high degree of evolutionary conservation among

Further disappearance of mutated cells does not
require passaging but also occurred in “aging”
primary cultures

mechanisms leading to the disappearance of tumor cells
in vitro may help to uncover basic growth requirements
of MED12-mutated UL and as well as novel drug targets.
Thus, it is of pivotal interest to see if the disappearance
of mutated cells is a phenomenon linked to enzymatic
treatment of cells associated with passaging or occurs
independent of this artificial procedure. Accordingly,
we have performed a series of experiments aimed at a
comparison between cells of UL subjected to repeated
passaging and those that were kept in continuous
stationary primary culture.

As a next step, we were interested in monitoring
changes of the frequency of the MED12 mutated cells
during in vitro propagation. Therefore, we passaged
the “young” primary cultures of five tumors (UL 06/1,
UL 06/2, UL 07/1, UL 07/2, and UL 07/3) three times
followed by sequencing. In all cases continuous passaging
was accompanied by a further reduction of the peak ratio
compared to the native tissue (5/5 cases) as well as to the
primary culture (4/4 cases, no data of the primary culture
were available for UL 07/3) (Figure 2). In the first passages
the decline ranged between 60% and 80% compared to
the corresponding primary culture. In UL 06/1, UL 06/2
and UL 07/2 the mutation was clearly detectable in the
first passage but rapidly disappeared in passage 2 and 3.
In contrast, UL 07/1 showed an almost complete loss of
the mutated peak already in the first passage. As to further
passaging the MED12 mutation was almost undetectable
in three of the cases whereas it remained clearly visible
until passage 3 in UL 06/2. Moreover, the number of
passages where mutated cells were still detectable seems
to depend on their frequency in the primary culture.
Next we were interested to see if a simple “aging”
of the confluent primary cultures leads to a decrease of the
mutated cells. Accordingly, primary cultures of six tumors
were kept unpassaged after they had reached confluency.
During that time, medium was changed every 2nd or 3rd
day until they were harvested. Compared to the “young”
primary cultures “aging” of the primary culture resulted
in a reduced mutated/non-mutated peak ratio in all six
tumors (UL 06/1, UL 06/2, UL 07/1, UL 07/2, UL 12/1,
and UL 12/2) (Figure 3 and Supplementary Figure 4).
In two tumors (UL 12/1 and UL 12/2) “aging” primary
cultures were harvested and analyzed at two different
times of in vitro growth. The cells were harvested one
and two weeks after “young” primary cultures. In general,
both points in time revealed a decline in mutated to nonmutated peak compared to the “young” primary cultures.
While in UL 12/1 a loss of 60% and 80%, respectively,
was noted in both “aging” primary cultures, in UL 12/2
the ratio of mutated/non-mutated peaks was decreased to
30% and remained nearly unchanged. However, in neither
of the cultures the disappearance of mutated cells was
accompanied by clear changes of cellular morphology.

RESULTS
MED12 mutations were found in the majority of
tumors initially analyzed
Initially, cell cultures from nine UL derived from
five patients were set up for cell culture. The results of
MED12 mutation analyses revealed mutations of that
gene in seven of these tumors (Table 1). Histologically,
all seven tumors were typical UL. Of these one carried a
MED12 in-frame deletion and the others showed singlebase substitutions (Supplementary Figure 1). All mutations
detected were identical to those previously detected in
UL and heterozygous. Accordingly, Sanger sequencing
resulted in peaks corresponding to the non-mutated and
mutated alleles, respectively. For further evaluation it
was presumed that the “non-mutated peak” results from
the normal allele of the tumor cells as well as from the
two normal alleles of bystander cells not belonging to
the tumor cell population. Vice versa, the “mutated peak”
is considered to have originated exclusively from the
mutated allele of the tumor cells.

In most cases, a decrease of mutated cells was
noted even in the primary culture
First, six of these cases (UL 06/1, UL 06/2,
UL 07/1, UL 07/2, UL 12/1, and UL 12/2) were used
for a comparative analysis of the peak ratios between
native tissue and primary cultures. In case UL 07/3,
cells of the primary culture were not available for
analysis. Compared to the native tissue the relative
height of peaks corresponding to the mutated allele had
decreased in the primary cultures of 5/6 tumors (UL 06/1,
UL 07/1, UL 07/2, UL 12/1, and UL 12/2) investigated.
Nevertheless, a strong variation of the decrease was noted
that ranged between an almost complete disappearance of
the mutated peak seen in UL 07/1, a huge loss of 67%
to 77% in UL 07/2 and UL 12/2, and a slight decrease
of only 17% to 27% observed in UL 06/1 and UL 12/1,
respectively (Figure 1 and Supplementary Figure 3). In the
remaining case (UL 06/2), a moderate increase of the ratio
was noted in the primary culture.

Passaging of the cells accelerated the loss of
mutated cells
We hypothesized that the procedures necessary for
passaging did not cause but may accelerate the loss of
mutated cells from the cultures. To validate this assumption
we have compared the loss in “aging” primary cultures with

the corresponding cell cultures that had been passaged within
the same interval of time. For this comparison, five pairs
of 3rd passage cells along with their matching unpassaged
primary cultures of the same “age” were used. The results
show that in all five cell cultures investigated the loss
occurred indeed more rapidly when cells are passaged. While
the loss strongly varied between the tumors, in all these pairs
the amount of mutated cells in the “aged” cultures exceeded
that seen in the 3rdpassage cells of the same “age” (Figure 4).
Furthermore, in 3/4 cultures the ratio in the “aged” cultures
exceeded that observed in the cells of the 1st passage.

the surface of the culture vessels. Thus, one would expect
a high amount of mutated cells in the supernatant. To
address this question, we have isolated and sequenced
DNA from cells in the supernatant of unpassaged cultures
of two UL (UL 12/1 and UL 12/2) and compared with
their matching adherent cells. The results confirmed the
assumption that mutated cells are lost from the monolayer
by their detachment since the amount of mutated cells
in the supernatant clearly exceeded that found in the
corresponding monolayer (Figure 5 and Supplementary
Figure 5). Simultaneously, we analyzed four UL (UL 06/1,
UL 06/2, UL 07/1, and UL 07/2) and compared the DNA
from the cells in the passages with their matching cells
in the supernatants directly obtained after passaging.
Consistent with our experience a huge amount of mutated
cells was observed in the supernatant of the first passage
(Figure 6). Increasing the number of passages revealed
a decline of the “mutated” peak in the corresponding
supernatant which, however, always remained higher
than in the correlating passaged cells. Even if no evidence
of mutated cells in the passaged culture was noted, they
were still detectable in the corresponding supernatant. The
results indicate that the mutated cells are also lost from the
cell cultures due to their problems of re-attachment after
passaging.

The different rates of loss of mutated cells did
not correlate with the presence of genomic
imbalances in addition to the MED12 driver
mutations
While the decrease of mutated cells in vitro strongly
varied among the different tumors investigated no obvious
explanation for these differences was apparent. MED12
mutations in UL are known to coincide often with other
genetic aberrations as e.g. deletions of part of the long
arm of chromosome 7, rearrangements of the HMGA1
locus at 6p21 or trisomy 12 in a considerable percentage
of cases [4]. These alterations might influence the “in
vitro behavior” of MED12-mutated cells. Thus, aimed
at the question whether or not the differences are due to
secondary genomic gains and losses in addition to the
MED12 mutations we used CNV arrays for the analysis
of the native tumor samples along with their matching
myometrium on four UL (UL 06/1, UL 06/2, UL 07/1, and
UL 07/2) with MED12 mutations. In none of the tumors
investigated relevant alterations of the CNV profiles
became apparent when comparing the leiomyomas with
the corresponding normal tissue (Supplementary Figure 6).
Thus, the reasons for the different kinetics of the loss of
mutated cells still remain to be elucidated.

DISCUSSION
Despite novel approaches to shrink UL and to
improve tumor related bleeding [13, 14] still unmet
medical needs remain in the treatment of these tumors.
Factors influencing the growth of UL are of high interest
and often have been studied using cells grown in vitro
(e.g. see [15–17]) making in vitro cultures derived from
leiomyomas a widespread model system for research into
biology and treatment of UL (for review see [18]).
As to their molecular pathogenesis, a number of
recurrent genetic alterations confined to the ULs but not
present in their surrounding myometrial tissue have been
identified. For example, certain types of chromosomal
deletions and translocations are often detected in UL.
Among these, translocations involving chromosomal
bands 12q14-15 and deletions of part of the long arm
of chromosome 7 are most frequently seen and in the

carrying HMGA2 rearrangements can survive much
longer [12, 20]. The loss of MED12-mutated cells even
during early phases of in vitro culturing is a phenomenon
challenging many previous data obtained using cell
cultures as a model system for research into the biology
of UL. While it is reasonable to postulate that only the
mutated cells represent the tumor cell population, the
mechanisms underlying the observed loss of tumor cells
are not understood yet. On the other hand, the loss of
tumor cells, at least in part, may explain the rapid loss
of estrogen receptors and, albeit at a lower rate, loss of
progesterone receptors, repeatedly described for UL
cultures based on a decrease of mRNA as well as proteins
[9, 21]. This loss may, at least in part, result from the loss
of positive cells from the cultures rather than from the
transcriptional downregulation of the corresponding genes
as previously assumed. Also, it may explain the gradual
loss of cells with some types of cytogenetic alterations as
e.g. deletions of the long arm of chromosome 7 known not
rarely to co-exist with MED12 mutations which has been

former case the gene encoding HMGA2, a member of
the family of high mobility group proteins, has been
identified as the molecular target of the alteration which
becomes drastically up-regulated due to the chromosomal
rearrangement [19]. Nevertheless, the majority of UL do
not show any chromosomal alterations but mutations of
the gene encoding Mediator subcomplex 12 (MED12), a
protein involved in the organization of the transcription
machinery. In most of these cases only a singly base
exchange can be detected but small in-frame deletions
and duplications do occur as well. This latter type of
mutation occasionally can co-exist with chromosomal
alterations except for those targeting HMGA2 [3–7]
and clearly represents the most common type of driver
mutations in UL. In vitro cells with this type of driver
mutation recently were shown to coincide with a strictly
reduced growth capacity in vitro, leading to their rapid
disappearance in cell culture [12, 20]. In contrast, other
cells from the samples not carrying these mutations of
presumed non-tumorigenic origin as well as from tumors

presented in vitro and of three-dimensional cell cultures
on the disappearance of MED12-mutated cells.
As to the results of the present study we cannot
decide if the main reason for the disappearance of the
tumor cells is the lack of an appropriate matrix or of
growth factors supporting cellular proliferation. On the
other hand, growth of non MED12-mutated bystander cells
does clearly not depend on these requirements because
a rapid overgrowth of these latter cells can be noted. In
general, the relative amount of non-mutated cells likely
indicates that these cells are not solely derived from the
tumor vasculature but represent a considerable amount
of the “leiomyoma-stroma” as well. Cell cultures thus
represent an interesting source to investigate the growth
balance between tumor cells and non-tumorigenic cells
and its disturbances, respectively because they provide
an interesting system to identify factors that selectively
support the growth of tumor cells. In turn, these factors
may be of relevance for in vivo growth thus representing
possible therapeutic targets. Furthermore, threedimensional cell cultures [22, 26, 27] may become a
model system suitable to replace monolayer cultures if
these latter type of culturing turns out better to support the
growth of MED12-mutated cells.
While the reduced ability of the cells will therefore
lead to a re-evaluation of many data obtained in the
past it, at the same time, will open novel experimental
opportunities and designs. However, the results of
the present study show a strong variation in the rate
of loss of MED12 mutated cells which at this time has
no straightforward explanation like the presence of

observed in cultures obtained from UL (Sabine Bartnitzke,
personal communication).
Herein, we were able to show that the treatment of
cells during passaging, while accelerating their loss, does
not constitute the main reason for disappearing of the
mutated cells because the loss even occurs from stationary
“aging” cultures. There is no obvious explanation for the
strongly varying rate of loss in vitro but among other
possible reasons the type of MED12 mutation may play a
role. Nevertheless, also in general there is no explanation
for the loss of mutated cells but from our data presented
herein it can be concluded that comparably “simple”
explanations like e.g. a higher sensitivity of the tumor
cells against trypsin treatment do not apply. Basically, two
groups of explanations seem plausible.
First, it is reasonable to assume that certain soluble
environmental factors not available under in vitro
conditions used for the cell cultures are required for the
survival of the tumor cells. Among these critical factors
lacking in vitro may be growth factors and hormones.
For future studies it may be worth to re-address this
question by analyzing the decrease of MED12-mutated
cells depending on different culture media including those
supplemented with hormones.
Secondly, the in vitro growth could depend on rather
“physical” factors as e.g. the presence of extracellular
matrix (ECM). Interestingly, the relevance of ECM in
the growth of UL had been a matter of numerous studies
and therapeutical approaches targeting ECM have been
proposed repeatedly (e.g. [22–25]). Accordingly, future
studies should address the possible influence of ECM

Figure 4: Passaging of cells accelerated the loss of MED12-mutated cells compared to simple “aging”. In all UL the
quantification of mutated to non-mutated allele of MED12 mutation shows a decrease of MED12-mutated alleles in passage 3 (P3) compared

additional genetic abnormalities as e.g. deletions of the
long arm of chromosome 7 or trisomy 12 which are
known to accompany MED12 mutations in a considerable
percentage of cases. Vice versa, for further experiments
it should be determined if there is only an intertumoral
variation or if variation can be seen also between different
samples from the same tumor. In any case it indicates that
investigating large series of samples will be necessary to
identify factors contributing to a prolonged survival of
MED12-mutated cells in vitro. As to further experiments
on larger series it should be noted that obviously not cells
from all types of UL do require these factors essential
for the growth of the MED12-mutated cells in vitro. UL
harboring HMGA2 rearrangements leading to its strong
upregulation [12, 20] constitute the second largest genetic
subgroup of UL the cells of which can survive for many
passages under the normal culture conditions [12, 20].
Also, for further experiments aimed at supplementing
various factors, studies on the clonality of the cells should
accompany mutation analyses considering recent results
obtained on these lesions [28].

liquid nitrogen, the remaining third was stored in sterile
Hank’s solution supplemented with antibiotics (500 IU/ml
penicillin, 500 µg/ml streptomycin) for cell culturing.
Informed written consent was obtained from all patients
for genetic characterization of their tumors and use in the
present study, respectively, which had been approved by
the ethics committee of Ärztekammer Bremen.

Cell cultures
From tumor samples stored in Hank’s solution, cell
cultures were set up as described recently [29]. In brief,
the tissue samples were minced into small pieces and
treated with collagenase (200 U) for 4.5 to 6 h. Dissociated
cells were centrifuged and resuspended in culture
medium (RPMI 1640 supplemented with 20% FCS,
100 IU/ml penicillin and 100 µg/ml streptomycin). The
resulting cell suspension of each tumor was transferred
into three cell culture flasks and incubated at 37°C and
5% CO2. Cultured cells were enzymatically harvested as
“young” primary culture at confluency or passaged using
trypsin (0.05%) with a 1:2 split ratio when reaching 80%
confluency. “Aging” primary cultures were not passaged
but continuously supplied with medium after confluency.

S, Liu Y, Mittal K, Kong B, Kurita T, Wei JJ. MED12 and
HMGA2 mutations: two independent genetic events in
uterine leiomyoma and leiomyosarcoma. Mod Pathol. 2014;
27:1144–53. doi: 10.1038/modpathol.2013.243.

CNV (copy number variation) analysis was
performed using premade CytoScan HD Arrays
(Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA) consisting more than
2.4 million markers for copy number alterations and
approximately 750,000 markers for single nucleotide
polymorphisms (SNPs). Enriched gene coverage results
in a marker-base ratio coverage of 1/384 for ISCA, 1/553
for cancer genes, 1/486 for X-chromosomal genes, and
1/659 for 12,000 OMIM genes. The manufacturer’s
instructions were followed for labelling of 300 ng DNA,
and hybridization. After staining and washing using a
GeneChip Fluidics Station 450 (Affymetrix) the arrays
were scanned by an Affymetrix 3000 7G scanner and
analyzed through the Affymetrix Chromosome Analysis
Suite (ChAS) software (ChAS analysis files for the
CytoScan® HD Array version NA33). Numbering of map
positions was based on hg19 (NCBI Build 37 reference
sequence). Filter settings of copy number changes across
the genome were ≥ 25 kbp and marker count ≥ 30.
