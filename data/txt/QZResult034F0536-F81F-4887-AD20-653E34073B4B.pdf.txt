ABSTRACT
Bmi-1 is a transcriptional regulator that promotes tumor cell self-renewal and
epithelial to mesenchymal transition and its upregulation is associated with tumor
progression, AMPK is an intracellular fuel-sensing enzyme and plays important roles
in tumor cell growth and progression. Thus, the present study aims to examine
the regulation of Bmi-1 by AMPK. First, our data revealed that, as compared to
adjacent normal tissue, Bmi-1 was highly expressed in gastric cancer, whereas
phosphorylation of AMPK (p-AMPK) was reduced. Similar findings were observed in
lung adenocarcinomas and appeared that the expression of Bmi- 1 was correlated with
pathological grades of the cancer, where opposite changes were found in p-AMPK.
Second, Metformin, a pharmacological AMPK activator and anti-diabetic drug, or
ectopic expression of LKB1, diminished expression of Bmi-1 in cancer cells, an event
that was reversed by silencing LKB1. Third, knockdown of LITAF, previously identified
as a downstream target of AMPK, upregulated Bmi-1, associated with increased cell
viability, colony formation, and migration of cancer cells in vitro. Fourth, metformin
increased the abundance of miR-15a, miR-128, miR-192, and miR-194, which was
prevented by knockdown of LITAF. Accordingly, transfection of these individual
miRNAs downregulated Bmi-1. Altogether, our data for the first time suggest a
regulatory axis in cancer cells: AMPK upregulates LITAF, which in turn increases
miRNAs, leading to attenuation of Bmi-1 expression.

INTRODUCTION

epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) [5]. At the
transcription level, Bmi-1 cooperates with c-myc to
repress expression of tumor suppressor genes including
p16Ink4a and p19Arf, thereby preventing apoptosis and
stimulating cell proliferation [7]. By contrary, knockdown
of Bmi-1 results in cell cycle arrest and inhibition of cell
proliferation, but increased cell differentiation [8]. Recent
studies have shown that multiple microRNAs could
repress translation of Bmi-1 and thus block proliferation
and metastasis of tumor cells [9–13].
Adenosine 5′-monophosphate (AMP)-activated
protein kinase (AMPK) is an energy sensor and plays
an important role in cellular metabolism and

B-lymphoma Moloney murine leukemia virus
insertion region-1 (Bmi-1), a member of the Polycomb
transcription repressors, participates in various biological
processes, including embryonic development, organ
formation, tumorigenesis, and stem cell self-renewal
and differentiation [1]. Previous studies have shown
that Bmi- 1 protein is overexpressed in different types of
human cancers, such as lung [2], gastric [3], and breast
cancers [4] and leukemia [5, 6]. Thus, Bmi-1 is accepted
as an oncogene that alters cell cycle, senescence, and
apoptosis by promoting tumor cell self-renewal and

biosynthesis of macromolecules. AMPK is an important
effector of the tumor suppressor LKB1. Thus, a large
number of studies have shown that activation of AMPK
by pharmacological activators such as metformin,
5-amino-1-β-D-ribofuranosyl-imidazole-4-carboxamide
(AICAR) and salicylate lead to inhibition of cancer
cell proliferation or induce apoptosis [14]. In animal
studies, AMPK activation has been shown to inhibit
tumorigenesis. Several previous studies have reported
that AMPK is reduced in human cancer specimens,
suggesting a role in tumorigenesis and tumor
progression [15]. Indeed, in vitro studies have shown
that activation of AMPK activity by pharmacological
activators sensitizes cancer cells to chemotherapy [16].
Lipopolysaccharide-induced TNFa factor (LITAF)
appears to be a multifunctional small protein consisting
of 161 amino acids [17]. It has been characterized
as a transcription factor for inflammatory cytokines
in macrophages [18]. In response to LPS, LITAF
translocates into the nucleus and binds to a specific
element on promoters for proinflammatory cytokines
such as the TNFa promoter, where it interacts and
cooperates with STAT6(B) to activate their transcription
[19]. Interestingly, the sequence of LITAF is identical to
the Small Integral Membrane Protein of the Lysosome/
late Endosome (SIMPLE). Mutations of LITAF/SIMPLE
are associated with a genetic disease called CharcotMarie-Tooth disease type 1C (CMT1C), characterized
by demyelinating disorders of peripheral nervous
system [20–22]. The precise role for the mutated LITAF
in the pathogenesis of this genetic disease remains
enigmatic. It has been suggested that the mutants fail to
target membrane proteins for recycling and lysosomal
degradation, leading to the death of Schwann cells.
Another aspect of LITAF function is related to its effect
on cancer cells. We have recently identified LITAF as
a downstream target of AMPK [23]. The expression of
LITAF in prostate cancer cells is upregulated by activation
of AMPK and suppressed by a dominant negative mutant
of AMPKa1 subunit or its shRNA. Furthermore, silencing
of LITAF in prostate cancer cells promotes proliferation,
anchorage-independent growth, and xenograft tumor
development. Additionally, we found that LITAF
participates in transcriptional regulation of TNFSF15, a
pro-inflammatory cytokine and also a potent inhibitor of
tumor angiogenesis [23]. In line with this, recent studies
have documented that expression of LITAF promotes
apoptosis and differentiation of acute myeloid leukemia
cells [24] and that autophagy is suppressed in lymphoma
cells where LITAF was silenced by BCL6 [25].
In the present study, we attempted to examine
if AMPK regulates expression of Bmil-1 and explore
the underlying mechanisms. We found that expression
of Bmi-1 was increased whereas phospho-AMPK was
decreased in gastric cancer and lung adenocarcinoma
specimens. In cancer cells, we found that metformin
activated AMPK, concurrently with upregulation of LIFAF
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

and downregulation of Bmi-1. Interestingly, our data
showed that LITAF mediated the effect of metformin on
upregulation of miR-15a, miR-128, miR-192, and miR-194,
all of which suppressed expression of bmi-1. Altogether, our
data for the first time depicted a regulatory axis sequentially
tethering AMPK-LITAF-miRNAs-Bmi-1 in cancer cells.

RESULTS
Altered expression of Bmi-1 and p-AMPK in
gastric cancer tissues and lung cancer tissue
To explore the correlation between AMPK and
Bmi-1, we collected 66 paraffin-embedded gastric cancer
specimens and 65 lung adenocarcinoma specimens
from the Department of Pathology, the First Affiliated
Hospital of Nanchang University. The specimens were
obtained from patients under the consent who underwent
surgical resection. The specimens were sectioned and
examined by immunohistochemical (IHC) staining with
antibodies against p-AMPK (T172), a parameter of
AMPK activation, and Bmi-1. Figures 1 and 2 showed
representatives of IHC images. While phospho-AMPK
was localized in the cytoplasm, Bmi-1 protein was present
in the nucleus. In gastric cancer, the signal of p-AMPK
was lower in tumor (p < 0.001) and Bmi-1 expression
higher in tumor (p < 0.001) than that of adjacent normal
tissues (Table 1, Figure 1). Similarly, the expression
of Bmi-1 progressively increased while p-AMPK was
decreased along with increases in pathological grade of
lung adenocarcinomas; the order of intensity of p-AMPK
(T172) appeared to be stageI > stage II > stage III
(spearman correlation = −0.397, p < 0.05), while Bmi-1
expression was stage I < stage II < stage III (spearman
correlation = 0.389, p < 0.05) (Table 2, Figure 2). As in
the lung cancer tissue slides, we could not find adjacent
normal tissue, we could not compare p-AMPK between
normal and cancer cells in this study.

Negative regulation of Bmi-1 expression by
LKB1/AMPK
We assessed whether activation of AMPK exerts
a causative effect on downregulation of Bmi-1 in cancer
cells. First, we treated A549 cells, a lung adenocarcinoma
cell line, with metformin and examined the expression
of Bmi-1. We found that metformin increased
phosphorylation of AMPK at T172 and simultaneously
reduced the abundance of Bmi-1 (Figure 3A). Next, we
made stable cells by ectopic expression of LKB1 in SGC7901 cells, gastric cancer cell line in which endogenous
LKB1 was very low and by infection of LKB1 shRNA in
AGS, another gastric cancer cell line, and then measured
mRNA and protein of Bmi-1. Our results revealed that
ectopic expression of LKB1 diminished the levels of
Bmi- 1 mRNA and protein, while silencing LKB1 caused
an opposite change of both (Figure 3B–3E).

by shRNA and examined the effect on Bmi- 1 expression
and cell behavior. As shown in Figure 5, knockdown
of LITAF in A549 and AGS cells caused a marked
increase in mRNA and protein levels of Bmi-1. This
was associated with cell viability, colony formation,
and migration of A549 cells (Figure 6). These results
suggest that LITAF plays an inhibitory role in regulation
of Bmi- 1, which may contribute to inhibition of cancers
cell progression.

To identify components downstream of AMPK in
regulation of Bmi-1, we assessed if LITAF had a role.
We first examined if the expression of LITAF and Bmi-1
was altered by metformin treatment. Our results showed
that metformin upregulated LITAF and downregulated
Bmi-1 in SGC-7901 and AGC cells (Figure 4) as well
as A549 cells (data not shown). We then silenced LITAF

downstream effector of AMPK in regulation of tumor cell
growth; however, the mechanism by which it mediates
the tumor suppressive function remains to be determined
[23]. In the present study, we attempted to depict the
linear relationship of AMPK, LITAF and Bmi-1 in cancer
cells. We found that expression of Bmi-1 and p-AMPK
inversely changed in gastric cancer tissues; p-AMPK level
was reduced, whereas Bmi-1 expression was increased, as
compared to adjacent tissues. Additionally, similar trend
was found in lung adenocarcinoma specimens. Our findings
of opposite changes in p-AMPK and Bmi-1 are interesting;
however, further correlation analysis on these changes
did not show significance, which was possibly reflected
by insufficient number of samples used in this study.
Nevertheless, the trend of changes prompted us to perform
in vitro assays to delineate their relationship in cancer cells.
Our results showed that AMPK activation increased the
abundance of LITAF and concurrently reduced expression
of Bmi-1, while knockdown of LITAF upregulated Bmi- 1
and promoted aggressive behaviors of cancer cells.
Furthermore, metformin activation upregulated miR-15a,
miR-128, miR-192, and miR-194, which was abolished
by knockdown of LITAF. Transfection of these individual
miRNAs diminished the expression of Bmi-l. Therefore,

To decipher the mechanism by which LITAF
regulates growth of cancer cells, we performed miRNA
microarray analysis on the A549 cells where LITAF
was silenced as compared with the control counterpart
containing scrambled shRNA (Supplementary Table 1). We
identified many miRNAs that were differentially expressed,
among which miR-15a, miR-128, miR-192, and miR-194
were focused, as they were previously reported to regulate
Bmi-1 [10–12, 26]. These microRNAs were increased by
metformin, which was abolished by knockdown of LITAF
(Figure 7). To further address if any of these miRNAs
had a role in regulation of Bmi-1, we transfected each of
them into SGC 7901 and A549 cells and then examined
Bmi-1 expression. As shown in Figure 8, Bmi-1 was
downregulated by transfection of each individual miRNAs.

DISCUSSION
As a key factor in energy metabolism, AMPK is
being widely accepted as a metabolic tumor suppressor
[14]. Our previous study has identified LITAF as a

our data for the first time indicate a regulatory axis of
AMPK-LITAF-miRNA-Bmi-1.
Thus far, only a few reports have suggested
that LITAF is involved in tumorigenesis. For
example, LITAF is silenced by homologous deletion
in primary mediastinal lymphoma and by promoter
hypermethylation in germinal center lymphoma [27].
This work does not clearly delineate whether silencing
of LITAF in these lymphomas is a coincident or causeeffect event. However, several studies suggest that
LITAF may have a tumor suppressive role. First, LITAF
could be downregulated by oncogenic protein BCL6
and ectopic expression of LITAF elicits autophagy
[25]. Second, transfection of LITAF induces apoptosis
of acute leukemia cells [24]. Third, we have previously

shown that knockdown of LITAF promotes proliferation
and migration of prostate cancer cells [23]. One of the
underlying mechanisms is the induction of TNFSF15, an
important negative regulator of tumor angiogenesis. In
the current study, we extended our study to other cancer
cells and confirmed the inhibitory effect of LITAF on
malignant behaviors in A549 cancer cells. Furthermore,
we identified Bmi-1 as another downstream target of
LITAF. It is possible the tumor suppressive function of
LITAF is mediated by its transcriptional activity [23] and
its effect on autophagy [28].
Previous studies have demonstrated that
dysregulated expression of Bmi-1 contributes to tumor cell
self-renewal and EMT, critical steps for tumor progression
and metastasis [29, 30]. It has been shown that Bmi-1 is

regulated by miRNAs; for instance, miR-15a is able to
bind to 3′-UTR of Bmi-1 mRNA to inhibit translation [10],
miR-128 can inhibit Bmi-1 expression in drug-resistant
cancer cells [31], and miR-194 blocks cancer cell EMT
through inhibition of Bmi-1 expression [12]. All these
miRNAs are known to be tumor-suppressing factors
[10, 12], [31], [26].
In the present study, the concentration of metformin
used was 10 mM, which is far above the concentration
(20–40 μM) achieved by routine oral administration in
plasma of patients with type 2 diabetes [32]. It has been
recognized that the concentration of metformin required
for in vitro activation of AMPK is much higher than that
in vivo [33]. A possible explanation is that metformin
transporter varies on different cell types, which results
in different kinetics in activation of AMPK, as observed
differences in AGS and SGC-7901 cells (Figure 4).

When the expression of the transporter is low, the dose
of metformin or incubation time will need to increase for
optimal activation of AMPK. In most in vitro study, the
incubation time with metformin is shorter than in vivo
experiments to reach steady state concentration in plasma.
Our present study showed that metformin increases
the expression of these miRNA, which is abrogated by
silencing LITAF. Therefore, our study for the first time
demonstrates that Bmi-1 is downregulated by AMPK and
LITAF, an event possibly occurring through upregulation of
miRNAs (Figure 9). In sum, previous publications by us and
others support that LITAF functions as a tumor suppressor.
We have shown that LITAF acts as transcriptional factor to
activate transcription of TNFSF15, so as to inhibit tumor
angiogenesis [23]. Our present study revealed that LITAF
upregulates a set of miRNAs. It is our future work to
elucidate the mechanism underlying this regulation.

later, cells were harvested and extracts subjected to Western blot analysis of Bmi-1. Upper: graphs represent averages of scan densitometry

GeneChip Hybridization oven 640 at 48oC with rotation
(60 rpm). The hybridized samples were washed and
stained using Affymetrix fluidics station 450. The first
stain with streptavidin-R-phycoerythrin (SAPE) was
followed by signal amplification using a biotinilated goat
anti-streptavidin antibody and another SAPE staining
(Hybridization, Washing and Sataining Kit, Affymetrix,
Santa Clara, CA). Microarrays were immediately scanned
using Affymetrix GeneArray Scanner 3000 7G Plus
(Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA). Affymetrix miRNA QC
Tool software http://www.affymetrix.com/estore/browse/
products.jsp?categoryIdClicked=&productId=131558)
was used for summarization, normalization and quality
control of the resulting CEL files.

qRT-PCR
Total RNA from cells was isolated using a Trizol
reagent, and reversely transcribed into cDNA using
a FastQuant RT Kit according to the manufacturers’
instructions. qPCR analysis of gene expression was
conducted using the Quant SYBR Green PCR kit, as
described by protocols of the manufacturer. The primers
were listed in Table 4.

MTT assay
Briefly, cells were seeded into 96-well plates at a
density of 1500 cells/well and cultured for up to 72 h. MTT
solution was then added into cell culture and incubated
for additional 4 h. After that, the cell culture medium
was replaced by addition of 150 ml dimethyl sulfoxide
(DMSO), and optical density was measured at absorbance
rate of 490 nm using a SpectraMax M Series Multi-Mode
Microplate Reader (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA,
USA). Cell viability was then plotted in graph.

Wound healing assay
In brief, cells were seeded into 6-well plates
at density of 5×105 cells/well and grew to 100%
confluence and then a scratch was made across the
monolayer using a pipette tip. The cell culture plates
were washed briefly with phosphate buffered saline
(PBS) for 3 times and added fresh DMEM without
FBS and further incubated for 24 h. Images of the
cells were captured at the time of scratch and the end
of experiment. The distance of cell wound healing was
measured and migration rate calculated according to
equation: (R0h–R24h/R0h).

Statistical analysis
Chi-square test was used to compare the difference
of Immunohistochemistry results and spearman analysis
to examine correlations. Quantitative data between groups
were expressed as mean ± standard deviation (SD) and
analyzed by using t- test. A p value less than or equal to
0.05 was considered statistically significant.
