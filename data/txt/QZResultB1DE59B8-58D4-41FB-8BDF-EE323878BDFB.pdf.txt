Abstract
Previously, we showed that the bioactive green tea polyphenol
epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) inhibits growth in soft
agar of breast cancer cells with Her-2/neu overexpression.
Using gene expression profiling, here we show that EGCG
treatment of Her-2/neu–driven mammary tumor cells alters
the expression of key regulators in the epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) pathway, reducing invasive phenotype. Specifically, the epithelial genes E-cadherin, g-catenin,
MTA3, and estrogen receptor a (ERa) were up-regulated by
EGCG, whereas the proinvasive snail gene was down-regulated. Consistently, EGCG inhibited branching colony growth and
invasion in Matrigel. EGCG treatment similarly inhibited
invasive phenotype of mouse mammary tumor cells driven
by Nuclear Factor-KB c-Rel and protein kinase CK2, frequently
found overexpressed in human breast disease. Recently, we
identified the Forkhead box O transcription factor FOXO3a
as a major transcriptional regulator of ERA. Given the pivotal
role of ERA in preventing EMT, we hypothesized that the
activation of FOXO3a by EGCG plays an important role in the
observed reversal of invasive phenotype in ERA-positive
breast cancer cells. EGCG treatment activated FOXO3a.
Ectopic expression of a constitutively active FOXO3a overrode
transforming growth factor-B1–mediated invasive phenotype
and induced a more epithelial phenotype, which was dependent on ERA expression and signaling. Conversely, a dominant
negative FOXO3a reduced epithelial phenotype of ERA-low
breast cancer cells. These results identify, for the first time,
a role for FOXO3a in the inhibition of invasive phenotype
in breast cancer cells with active ERA signaling and elucidate
a novel mechanism whereby EGCG represses EMT of breast
cancer cells. [Cancer Res 2007;67(12):5763–70]

Introduction
Consumption of tea around the world is believed second only to
water, although the levels vary widely by country. Green tea is rich
in polyphenols, which have potent antioxidant properties. The
most abundant polyphenol in green tea is epigallocatechin-3 gallate
(EGCG). Many cancer epidemiologic studies have shown an inverse
association between green tea consumption and cancer incidence,
of which breast cancer risk reduction and tea consumption are
among the best characterized (1). For example, consumption of

green tea was closely associated with decreased numbers of axillary
lymph node metastases among premenopausal patients with stage
I and II breast cancer and with increased expression of
progesterone receptor and estrogen receptor a (ERa) among
postmenopausal women (2). An inverse correlation between
regular green tea consumption before breast cancer diagnosis
and the subsequent risk of recurrence has also been shown (3).
Studies using animal models have similarly shown a powerful
protective role of green tea against mammary gland malignancies.
Initial studies were done with chemical carcinogens. For example,
diets containing green tea catechins significantly increased survival
of female Sprague-Dawley (S-D) rats treated with 7,12-dimethylbenz(a)anthracene (DMBA) compared with those given regular
chow diet (4). In work from our group, S-D rats were given either
0.3% green tea or water as their sole fluid source and then treated
with DMBA. We observed a significant increase in mean latency to
first tumor, an approximate 70% decrease in tumor burden, and an
87% reduction in the number of invasive tumors per tumor-bearing
animal in the rat group drinking green tea (5). Similar protection
has been seen in other animal models of cancer, including those of
the prostate, skin, and lung (1). For example, oral infusion of a
polyphenolic fraction isolated from green tea significantly inhibited
prostate cancer development and increased survival in the
transgenic adenocarcinoma of mouse prostate (TRAMP) mouse
model (6). Furthermore, oral application of green tea polyphenols
resulted in markedly reduced tumor size in UV B–induced DMBAinitiated skin tumors in mice (7).
To begin to examine the molecular mechanisms of green tea
action, we have turned to cells in culture transformed by specific
oncogenes, e.g., Her-2/neu or ErbB2, the second member of the
epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor family or the Nuclear
Factor-nB (NF-nB) c-Rel subunit. Her-2/neu is overexpressed in
about 30% of human breast cancers and indicates poor prognosis.
Her-2/neu overexpression confers anchorage-independent growth
and invasion properties in vitro (8), and correlates with axillary
lymph node positivity and the presence of vascular invasion and
metastases in breast cancer patients (9). The gene expression
signature of Her-2/neu–transformed tumor cells shows high
expression of genes promoting proliferation, migration, invasion,
and metastasis and low expression of those promoting apoptosis
and immune response (10). Constitutive activation of the phosphoinositide-3-kinase (PI3K) to Akt/protein kinase B to NF-nB signaling
pathway has been implicated in the induction of growth and
transformed phenotype of Her-2/neu–overexpressing cells (11–13).
Of note, we observed that treatment of Her-2/neu–overexpressing
breast cancer cells with EGCG reduced PI3K, Akt, and NF-nB activity
and anchorage-independent growth (14).
Epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT), which has been
recognized for several decades as a critical feature of embryogenesis,

has more recently been shown to be relevant for cancer. During
EMT, cancer cells lose expression of proteins that promote cellcell contact such as E-cadherin and g-catenin and acquire
mesenchymal markers such as the zinc-finger transcription factor
Snail, vimentin, fibronectin, and N-cadherin (15, 16), which
promote cell migration and invasion (17). Recent work by several
groups has uncovered a signaling pathway that inhibits EMT in
cancer cells linked to ERa signaling. Transcription of MTA3, a
component of the histone deacetylase NuRD, is regulated by ERa
(16). In turn, NuRD represses transcription of the gene encoding
Snail, which represses E-cadherin gene transcription (18). Thus,
ERa plays a central role in the control of EMT. The expression
status of Her-2/neu and ERa correlate inversely in breast cancer
(19, 20). Reduced ERa activity in breast tumors is frequently
associated with a switch from an epithelial architecture to
induction of invasive growth (15, 16). We recently showed that
ERa synthesis is controlled by the Forkhead family transcription
factor FOXO3a, and that the activity of FOXO3a is greatly reduced
in Her-2/neu–driven cancers due to constitutive Akt kinase
activity (21). Because Her-2/neu–mediated activation of Akt was
repressed upon EGCG treatment (14), here we tested the
hypothesis that activation of FOXO3a by EGCG can revert invasive
phenotype of breast cancer cells that are ERa low. We show that
EGCG represses invasive phenotype of breast cancer cells driven
by Her-2/neu, as well by the NF-nB c-Rel subunit and protein
kinase CK2, via inducing FOXO3a, which activates the ERa to
E-cadherin pathway leading to an epithelial expression profile.
Thus, our studies elucidate, for the first time, a novel functional
role of FOXO3a as an important upstream mediator of the antiinvasive effects of ERa in breast cancer cells.

Materials and Methods
Cell growth and treatment conditions. The mouse mammary tumor
virus (MMTV)–Her-2/neu cell line NF639 (kindly provided by P. Leder,
Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA) was derived from a mammary gland
tumor and cultured as described previously (22). The rel-3875 line was
derived from a mammary adenocarcinoma with poorly differentiated large
cells that developed in the MMTV–c-rel mouse (23). The rel/CK2-5839 cell
line was derived from a mammary adenocarcinoma in the MMTV–c-rel 
MMTV-CK2a bitransgenic mouse (24). The NF639, rel-3875, and rel/CK25839 cells are invasive and express low levels of ERa (ref. 21 and see
below). NMuMG, which is an untransformed, immortalized mouse
mammary epithelial cell line, was cultured as described previously (25).
The MDA-MB-231 ERa-negative breast cancer cell line was grown as
described previously (24). EGCG, purchased from LKT Laboratories Inc.,
was dissolved in sterile DMSO. ICI 182,780 and transforming growth
factor-h1 (TGF-h1) were purchased from Tocris Cookson and R&D
Systems, respectively.
Plasmid constructs and transfection analysis. The expression vectors
for wild-type (WT) FOXO3a, constitutively active A3 FOXO3a mutant,
dominant negative FOXO3a (FOXO DN), and parental pECE vectors were
kindly provided by M. Greenberg and A. Brunet (Harvard Medical School,
Boston, MA; ref. 26). In the A3 mutant, three sites of Akt phosphorylation of
FOXO3a (T32, S253, S315) were mutated to alanine residues. The dominant
negative TM DDB FOXO3a mutant has a deletion in the DNA binding
domain and no longer binds to DNA; however, it still localizes in the nucleus
and may titer transcriptional coactivators away from endogenous FOXO,
thereby exerting a dominant-negative effect (27). The E-cadherin promoter
reporter vector contained 21 bp of the E-cadherin gene (28) subcloned
into the pGL3-Basic luciferase (Luc) reporter construct. The SV40
h-galactosidase (h-gal) reporter vector (23) was used to normalize
transfection efficiency. For reporter assays, cells were plated in 6- or
12-well plates, and 24 h later, cells were transfected, in triplicate, with

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (12). June 15, 2007

the indicated amounts of DNA using Fugene6 transfection reagent (Roche
Diagnostics Co.). Forty-eight hours after transfection, luciferase assays were
done as described previously (23).
Matrigel assay. Matrigel was diluted to a concentration of 6.3 mg/mL
with serum free medium (DMEM) and stored at 80jC. Before use, diluted
Matrigel was thawed on ice overnight. For the bottom layer, 200 AL of
Matrigel solution was added into a 24-well tissue culture plate and
incubated at 37jC for 30 min to allow the Matrigel to solidify. A single cell
suspension (5  103 cells/10 AL) was then mixed with 190 AL of Matrigel at
4jC and added to the solidified bottom layer. The plates were incubated at
37jC for 30 min to allow the Matrigel to solidify, and 500 AL complete
medium containing the appropriated concentration of EGCG or DMSO was
then added. Following incubation at 37jC for 5 to 7 days, the cell growth
was analyzed using a Zeiss Axiovert 200 M microscope.
Migration and invasion assays. Suspensions of 5105 cells were layered
in the upper compartment of a Transwell (Costar) on an 8-mm-diameter
polycarbonate filter (8 Am pore size) and incubated at 37jC for the
indicated times. For invasion assays, filters were precoated with 30 Ag of
Matrigel. Migration of the cells to the lower side of the filter was evaluated
with the acid phosphatase enzymatic assay using p-nitrophenyl phosphate
and OD410 nm determination.
Immunoblot analysis. Cells were rinsed with cold PBS and harvested
in lysis buffer [50 mmol/L Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 5 mmol/L EDTA (pH 8.0),
150 mmol/L NaCl, 0.5 mmol/L DTT, 2 Ag/mL aprotinin, 2 Ag/mL LP,
0.5 mmol/L phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5% NP40]. Whole cell extracts
were obtained by sonication, followed by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for
30 min. Samples were subjected to electrophoresis in an 8% or 10%
polyacrylamide-SDS gel and immunoblotting, as previously described (13).
Antibodies against ERa and vimentin were purchased from NeoMarker.
Antibodies against Snail (sc-10432) were purchased from Santa Cruz
Biotechnology. The E-cadherin and g-catenin antibodies were purchased
from BD Transduction Lab, and the h-actin (AC-15) and FOXO3a antibodies
were from Sigma and Upstate Biotechnology, respectively.
RNA preparation and reverse transcription-PCR analysis. Cultures
were washed twice with PBS, and total RNA was harvested using the
UltraspecII RNA isolation kit (Biotecx), following the manufacturer’s
instructions. The primers and annealing temperatures used for PCR are
as follows: E-cadherin 5¶-CAGCGTCAACTGGACCATTG-3¶ and 5¶CCACCGTTCTCCTCCGTAGA-3¶ at 65jC; MTA3 5¶-CAACCCAGCCTTCACATGAGT-3¶ and 5¶-TTCCACGGGAGAAAGTCCTG-3¶ at 65jC and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (Gapdh) 5¶-TCACCATCTTCCAGGAG-3¶
and 5¶-GCTTCACCACCTTCTTG-3¶ at 60jC. The cycle numbers for each gene
and RNA preparation from different cell types were determined to be in the
linear and quantitative range in pilot experiments. PCR products were
analyzed on 5% acrylamide gels run with 0.5 Tris-borate EDTA buffer and
stained with GelStar nucleic acid stain (Bio Whittaker Molecular
Applications).
Retroviral gene delivery. The cDNAs of human WT FOXO3a and the
A3 mutant and dominant negative FOXO3a (FOXO DN) were excised
from the pECE expression vector by HindIII and XbaI digestion and endfilled by Klenow enzyme. The blunt-end fragment was then ligated into
the SnaBI site of the pBabe-puro ecotropic retroviral vector (29), yielding
pBabe-puro-A3FOXO3a and pBabe-puro-dnFOXO3a, respectively. Phoenix
packaging cells were used for the generation of retrovirus, which were
selected with 500 Ag/mL hygromycin to increase Gag and Pol viral
protein expression. Briefly, P100 dishes of 80% confluent Phoenix cells
were transfected with 15 Ag of pBabe-puro-FOXO3a (A3 or DN) or
pBabe-puro along with 5 Ag of an Env-expressing vector. After 24 h, the
medium was changed, and cells were incubated for another 24 h at 32jC
to increase retrovirus half-life. Supernatants containing retrovirus were
then harvested, filtered, and transferred onto target cells in the presence
of 2 Ag/mL polybrene (Sigma). After 24 h, infected cells were washed,
selected with complete medium plus 4 Ag/mL puromycin for 4 days, and
expanded in medium containing 1 Ag/mL puromycin. As a positive
control, cells were infected with the pBabe-puro-GFP retrovirus,
indicating more than 90% efficiency in retroviral infection (data not
shown).

EGCG Induces FOXO3a and ERa to Reverse EMT

Results
Green tea polyphenol EGCG promotes a less invasive profile
of gene expression in Her-2/neu–overexpressing cells. To
further elucidate the molecular mechanisms whereby EGCG alters
Her-2/neu–mediated transformation, microarray analysis was done
with samples from two independent experiments (Affymetrix
Mouse 430A 2.0 chips). RNA samples from NF639 cells treated for
24 h with 60 Ag/mL EGCG showed an up-regulation of E-cadherin,
a-catenin, ERa, and MTA3 and a down-regulation of the
proinvasive master regulators Snail1 and Snail3 compared with
control DMSO-treated cells; whereas no differences were seen in
the expression of control housekeeping genes h-actin, glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate, peptidylprolyl isomerase A, or phosphoglycerate
kinase 1 (data not shown). To verify the findings with microarray,
NF639 cells were treated with EGCG or DMSO and total RNA
harvested and subjected to analysis for expression of E-cadherin
and MTA3 by reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR). EGCG treatment induced the expression of these two anti-invasive genes
(Fig. 1A). Furthermore, when protein extracts were probed for the
expression of E-cadherin, a substantial induction was observed
(Fig. 1B). Similarly, the epithelial marker g-catenin was induced,
whereas expression of Snail was decreased. EGCG treatment also

phenotype. A and B, NF639 cells were treated with 40 Ag/mL EGCG or carrier
DMSO for 48 h, and RNA and whole cell protein extracts were prepared. A , RNA
was subjected to RT-PCR for E-cadherin (E-cadh ), MTA-3 and Gapdh , which
confirmed equal loading. B, samples of whole cell protein extracts were
subjected to immunoblotting for E-cadherin, g-catenin, Snail, ERa, FOXO3a, and
h-actin, which confirmed equal loading. C, left, NF639 cells were grown in
Matrigel with addition of 40 Ag/mL EGCG or carrier DMSO for 5 d. The plates
were photographed by a Zeiss Axiovert 200M microscope using an Orca ER
camera at 50 magnification (Matrigel ). C, right, NF639 were plated at low
confluence in P100 plates and then treated with 40 Ag/mL EGCG or carrier
DMSO. After 4 d, the cells were photographed at a magnification of 50
(2D-Culture ). D, NF639 cells were treated with 40 Ag/mL EGCG or carrier DMSO
for 24 h, and then 5  105 cells were subjected to an invasion assay for 16 h.

induced expression of FOXO3a and its target gene ERa (Fig. 1B),
consistent with our previous findings (21). Thus, EGCG induces an
anti-invasive gene expression signature in the highly malignant
Her-2/neu–overexpressing NF639 breast cancer cells.
EGCG inhibits invasive phenotype of NF639 cells. One of the
hallmarks of invasive mesenchymal phenotype is the branching
colony formation in Matrigel. The Her-2/neu–overexpressing
NF639 cells, which grow effectively in soft agar (14), formed
branched colony structures with a highly invasive phenotype in
Matrigel (Fig. 1C, DMSO and data not shown). When 40 Ag/mL of
EGCG was added to the NF639 cells in Matrigel, the branched
structures were dramatically reduced (Fig. 1C, left). Similar data
were obtained upon treatment with 20 Ag/mL EGCG (data not
shown), which has little effect on growth of these cells (14).
Furthermore, the cells took on a more flattened, normal
morphology when grown on plastic (Fig. 1C, right). Lastly,
incubation with EGCG profoundly reduced the ability of NF639
cells to invade through Matrigel (Fig. 1D). Together, these data
indicate EGCG can reverse the mesenchymal characteristics of
Her-2–driven mammary cancer cells, promoting a less invasive
phenotype.
EGCG inhibits invasive phenotype of c-Rel– and CK2-driven
mammary cancer cells. Almost 90% of human breast cancers
contain active, nuclear c-Rel (30), which can play a causal role in
mammary tumorigenesis (23). The serine/threonine protein kinase
CK2, which has been implicated in basal NF-nB activity (31), is
overexpressed in most human breast cancers (32). We next tested
the effectiveness of EGCG on invasive tumor lines rel-3875 and
rel/CK2-5839 cells, which were derived from mammary tumors in
MMTV–c-rel transgenic, and MMTV–c-rel  MMTV-CK2a
bitransgenic mice, respectively. EGCG inhibited the ability of rel3875 and rel/CK2-5839 cells to form invasive colonies in Matrigel
(Fig. 2A, top) and induced a more normal, i.e., less elongated,
epithelial cell morphology (Fig. 2A, bottom). Similarly, invasive
colony formation of rel/CK2-5839 cells in Matrigel was inhibited
upon treatment with 20 Ag/mL EGCG for 1 day, which has no
effect on growth rate (data not shown). The effects of EGCG
treatment on expression of EMT genes were examined next.
Consistent with the morphologic changes, EGCG treatment very
effectively induced expression of epithelial markers E-cadherin
and g-catenin and reduced the level of Snail, the repressor of
E-cadherin gene transcription, in rel-3875 and rel/CK2-5839 cells
(Fig. 2B). Furthermore, EGCG treatment led to increased levels of
ERa in both lines (Fig. 2B). EGCG also profoundly inhibited the
ability of rel-3875 cells to invade through Matrigel (Fig. 2C), as
seen above with NF639 cells. Lastly, we assessed the ability of
EGCG to reverse the formation of invasive colonies by rel-3875
cells. After an initial 4 days in Matrigel, substantial invasive colony
formation was noted (Fig. 2D, day 0). At this time, either EGCG or
carrier DMSO was added, and the plates were incubated for an
additional 10 days. EGCG completely reverted invasive colony
formation, whereas continued growth of invasive colonies was
observed in the presence of carrier DMSO (Fig. 2D, day 10). Thus,
EGCG potently inhibits the invasive properties of breast cancer
cells driven by c-rel and c-relxCK2, reverting mesenchymal and
promoting a more epithelial phenotype.
EGCG induces FOXO3a, which reverses invasive phenotype.
Given the pivotal role of ERa in EMT and our findings that FOXO3a
is a major regulator of ERa gene transcription (21), we next
examined the effects of EGCG treatment on FOXO3a expression
in rel-3875 and rel/CK2-5839 cells. EGCG caused a substantial

Figure 2. EGCG inhibits invasive phenotype of rel-3875 and rel/CK2-5839 cells. A, top, rel-3875 and rel/CK2-5839 cells were grown in Matrigel with addition of
60 Ag/mL EGCG or carrier DMSO as control. After 5 d, the colonies were photographed, as above, at a magnification of 50 (Matrigel ). A, bottom, rel-3875 and
rel/CK2-5839 cells were plated at low confluence in P100 plates and then treated with 60 Ag/mL EGCG or carrier DMSO. After 3 d, the cells were photographed at a

(25 Ag) were subjected to immunoblotting for E-cadherin (E-Cad ), g-catenin (c-cat), Snail, ERa, FOXO3a, and h-actin. C, rel-3875 cells were treated with 40 Ag/mL
EGCG or carrier DMSO for 24 h, and then 5  105 cells were subjected to an invasion assay for 16 h. OD410 nm values correspond to cells that migrated to the

increase in FOXO3a in the two lines (Fig. 2B). To directly test the
role of FOXO3a in preventing invasive growth in Matrigel, NF639
cells were infected with either a retrovirus expressing a constitutively active form of FOXO3a (A3; ref. 26) or the empty pBabe
vector. The exogenous expression of FOXO3a was confirmed by
immunoblotting and led to an induction of E-cadherin protein
levels (Fig. 3A). Moreover, active FOXO3a reduced the level of Snail
protein, the transcriptional repressor of the E-cadherin gene
(Fig. 3A). When plated in Matrigel, the presence of pBabe had
minimal effects on the cellular phenotype as judged by the extensive
branched structures (Fig. 3B, top). Importantly, when A3 FOXO3aexpressing NF639 cells were grown in Matrigel, the branching
growth was completely blocked, resulting in the appearance of
tightly clustered cells. When grown on plastic, A3 FOXO3a
expression caused the cells to have a more epithelial morphology
(Fig. 3B, bottom), but the growth of the cells was only modestly
affected, suggesting that the reduced size of colonies in Matrigel
was not simply a result of inhibition of cell cycle progression.
Furthermore, ectopic A3 FOXO3a expression caused a substantial
decrease in migration of NF639 cells (Fig. 3C). These findings could
be further extended to the rel/CK2-5839 (Fig. 3D), consistent
with the observed decrease in levels of the master regulator of EMT
Snail (Fig. 3D, inset). Thus, sustained FOXO3a activity resulting from
the A3 constitutively active mutant reverts the invasiveness
conferred by the oncogenic inducers Her-2/neu and c-Rel/CK2.

FOXO3a prevents TGF-B1–induced EMT of NMuMG cells.
Another commonly used cell model to study induction of invasive
phenotype is the mouse mammary epithelial NMuMG cells, which
form a monolayer under normal growth conditions, but change to a
fibroblastic phenotype when treated with TGF-h1 (33). This model
was used to further assess the role of FOXO3a in EMT. NMuMG
cells, infected with a retrovirus expressing either WT FOXO3a, A3
FOXO3a, or the empty pBabe vector, were treated with 1 ng/mL
TGF-h1 for 48 h. The expression of the exogenous FOXO3a was
confirmed by probing the whole cell extracts with a FOXO3a
antibody (Fig. 4A). The expression of pBabe, WT, or A3 FOXO3a had
minimal effects on the appearance of the cells in the absence of
TGF-h1 (Fig. 4B, left), although an f20% reduction of growth rate
was observed with cells expressing A3 FOXO3a (data not shown).
However, when the cells were grown in the presence of TGF-h1,
the pBabe-expressing NMuMG cells appeared spindle shaped, a
hallmark of mesenchymal phenotype (Fig. 4B, right). Expression of
WT FOXO3a resulted in an increased number of flattened cells,
indicative of an epithelial phenotype; whereas almost all the cells
expressing A3 FOXO3a appeared flattened and epithelial in
morphology (Fig. 4B, right). The higher potency of A3 FOXO3a in
improving the epithelial appearance is consistent with the inability
of this FOXO3a mutant to be phosphorylated and thereby inactivated. In particular, treatment of NMuMG cells with TGF-h1
for 48 h resulted in an increase in inactive (phosphorylated) WT

FOXO3a (data not shown). Given the ability of A3 FOXO3a to
promote a more epithelial phenotype, we assessed its effects on
E-cadherin expression. TGF-h1 treatment resulted in a decrease in
E-cadherin levels in the pBabe cells (Fig. 4C), consistent with the

NMuMG cells were infected with either the pBabe-puro (pBabe), pBabe-puro-WT

selection with puromycin, whole cell protein extracts were prepared from the
indicated cells and subjected to immunoblotting for FOXO3a (FOXO ) and h-actin
(A ). Alternatively, cells were plated and then treated with 1 ng/mL TGF-h1 (+) or

After 5 d of selection with puromycin, cells were plated at low confluence
and treated with 1 ng/mL TGF-h1 (+) or its control solution 0.1% BSA in 4 mmol/L

immunoblotting for E-cadherin and h-actin.

altered cellular morphology (Fig. 4B). In contrast, E-cadherin
expression was higher in cells expressing A3 FOXO3a, and the levels
were maintained following TGF-h1 treatment (Fig. 4C). Hence,
functional FOXO3a reduces TGF-h1–mediated EMT of NMuMG
cells.
FOXO3a induces E-cadherin expression via ERA signaling.
We next hypothesized that ectopic expression of FOXO3a in
NMuMG cells activates the ERa to E-cadherin pathway. NMuMG
cells were transfected with vectors expressing the empty vector
pECE, WT, or constitutively active A3 FOXO3a. Whole cell protein
extracts were probed for the expression of E-cadherin (Fig. 5A).
Expression of both WT and A3 FOXO3a induced E-cadherin protein
levels, with the constitutively active A3 FOXO3a again being more
effective, consistent with our previous findings, demonstrating that
it more effectively induces ERa promoter activity and expression
than WT FOXO3a (21). Immunoblotting confirmed ectopic
expression of WT, and A3 FOXO3a was essentially equivalent,
and Coomassie blue staining of proteins showed equal loading
(Fig. 5A). In agreement with the increase in protein levels, RT-PCR
showed both WT and A3 FOXO3a increased E-cadherin mRNA
levels in transfected cells, with the A3 FOXO3a again leading to a

Figure 5. FOXO3a induces E-cadherin expression. A, NMuMG cells were transfected with empty vector pECE (EV ), WT, or A3 FOXO3a. Approximately 40 h after
transfection, cells were harvested, and whole cell protein extracts were prepared for immunoblotting for E-cadherin and FOXO3a. Coomassie blue staining (Staining ) of
the blot was used as a loading control because h-actin was run off the gel to achieve the separation of different phospho-FOXO3a species. B, NMuMG cells were
transiently transfected, in triplicate, in six-well plates with 0.5 Ag E-cadherin promoter-Luc vector, 0.5 Ag SV40-h-gal and 1 Ag empty vector pECE, WT, or A3 FOXO3a.
Forty-eight hours after transfection, luciferase activity was measured and normalized to h-gal activity. Inset, NMuMG cells were transfected with pECE (EV ), WT,
and A3 FOXO3a. Approximately 40 h after transfection, total RNA was prepared, and the mRNA expression of E-cadherin (E-Cad ) and Gapdh was assessed by
RT-PCR analysis. C, rel-3875 cells were transiently transfected, in triplicate, in 12-well plates with 0.1 Ag E-cadherin (E-cad ) promoter-Luc vector, 0.1 Ag SV40-h-gal,
and 0.3 Ag pBabe-puro-A3FOXO3a or pBabe-puro. Forty-eight hours after transfection, luciferase activity was measured and normalized to h-gal activity.

more substantial effect (Fig. 5B, inset). Next, we tested the ability of
the A3 FOXO3a protein to induce E-cadherin promoter activity.
Expression of the A3 FOXO3a led to a potent activation of the
E-cadherin promoter in both NMuMG (Fig. 5B) and rel-3875 cells
(Fig. 5C).
We next asked whether a dominant negative FOXO3a (FOXO
DN) can induce mesenchymal gene expression. Untransformed
NMuMG cells were infected with either pBabe or FOXO DN, and
whole cell extracts were analyzed. The dominant negative FOXO3a
reduced E-cadherin and g-catenin levels and increased the
expression of Snail (Fig. 6A). Expression of the dominant negative
FOXO3a similarly repressed E-cadherin protein level in rel-3875
and rel/CK2-5839 cells (Fig. 6B). Expression of ERa, a known target

of FOXO3a, was potently reduced by expression of the dominant
negative FOXO3a, confirming the efficiency of this mutant to block
FOXO3a activity (Fig. 6B). Thus, FOXO3a induces a gene expression
profile associated with a more epithelial phenotype in rel-3875 and
rel/CK2-5839 cells, which express low level of ERa, similar to
NF639 cells (ref. 21 and data not shown).
To test the role of ERa in FOXO3a signaling to E-cadherin
expression, two approaches were used. We first subjected the
prototypical ERa-negative MDA-MB-231 cancer cell line to similar
analysis. A3 FOXO3a failed to induce E-cadherin expression in
MDA-MB-231 cells (Fig. 6C). Immunoblotting confirmed FOXO3a
expression. We next tested whether inhibition of ERa blocks the
effects of FOXO3a on EMT in ERa-positive rel/CK2-5839 cells.

Figure 6. FOXO3a induces a more epithelial gene expression profile in ERa-low breast cancer cells. A, NMuMG cells were infected with pBabe-puro-dnFOXO3a
(FOXO DN ) or pBabe-puro ( ) retrovirus and selected for 4 d with puromycin. Whole cell protein extracts (15 Ag) were subjected to immunoblotting for E-cadherin
(E-cad ), g-catenin (c-caten ), FOXO3a (FOXO ), Snail, and h-actin. Positions of FOXO3a, FOXO3a DN, and non-specific bands (ns ) are as indicated. B, rel-3875
and rel/CK2-5839 cells, respectively, were transfected or infected with pBabe-puro-dnFOXO3a (FOXO DN ) or pBabe-puro ( ) retrovirus and selected for 4 d with
puromycin. Whole cell protein extracts (50 Ag for rel-3875 cells and 20 Ag for rel/CK2-5839 cells) were subjected to immunoblotting for E-cadherin, FOXO3a, ERa,
and h-actin. Positions of FOXO3a, FOXO3a DN, and nonspecific bands are as indicated. C, MDA-MB-231 cells were transfected with parental pECE (EV ) or A3
FOXO3a (A3) DNA. Approximately 40 h after transfection, whole cell protein extracts were prepared and subjected to immunoblotting for E-cadherin and FOXO3a.
Coomassie blue staining of the blot was used to control for equal loading because the gel was electrophoresed extensively to achieve better separation of
hypo- and hyperphosphorylated FOXO3a species, such that h-actin was run off the gel. D, rel/CK2-5839 cells were infected with pBabe-puro-A3 FOXO3a (A3) or
pBabe-puro (pBabe ) retrovirus. After 4 d of selection with puromycin, cells were plated and then treated with 1 Amol/L ICI 182,780 (ICI ) or vehicle ethanol (Cont ) for
48 h. Whole cell protein extracts (20 Ag) were subjected to immunoblotting for E-cadherin, g-catenin, ERa, FOXO3a, and h-actin.

EGCG Induces FOXO3a and ERa to Reverse EMT

Ectopic expression of A3 FOXO3a induced the levels of E-cadherin
and g-catenin, as well as ERa, as expected (Fig. 6D). The addition
of the antiestrogen ICI 182,780, which inhibits estrogen-dependent
ERa function (34) and decreases ERa protein levels (35), blocked
the activation of the E-cadherin and g-catenin genes by FOXO3a
(Fig. 6D). Taken together, these data indicate that FOXO3a confers
anti-invasive properties in breast cancer cells via an ERa-mediated
pathway.

Discussion
Here, we show for the first time a role for the Forkhead family
member FOXO3a in control of EMT of ERa-low breast cancer
cells. Recently, we identified two forkhead elements upstream of
ERa promoter B and showed that FOXO3a can potently activate
ERa gene transcription (21), which was confirmed by Madureira
et al. (36). Activation of FOXO3a and resulting enhanced ERa
signaling by EGCG promoted a less malignant phenotype of breast
cancer cells. ERa signaling has been shown to promote a more
epithelial phenotype via inhibiting synthesis of Snail, a repressor of
E-cadherin expression (16). ERa can induce synthesis of MTA3, a
component of the HDAC NuRD, which inhibits Snail gene
transcription. In the presence of active ERa signaling, we noted
that EGCG induced a more epithelial gene expression profile, i.e.,
increased expression of MTA3, E-cadherin, g-catenin while repressing Snail. Of note, FOXO3a inhibited the formation of invasive
colonies in Matrigel, invasive phenotype induced by TGF-h1 signaling, and reduced the ability of cells to migrate. In the absence
of ERa signaling, this movement of gene expression toward an epithelial phenotype did not occur. Hence, our studies place FOXO3a
upstream of ERa in the MTA3/NuRD pathway that represses the
expression Snail and thereby promotes a less invasive, more epithelial phenotype.
The ability of active FOXO3a to functionally promote a less
invasive phenotype via ERa signaling defines a novel aspect for
FOXO proteins as potential tumor suppressors. FOXO proteins
have been shown to induce cell cycle arrest, maintain genome
stability, and promote apoptosis largely by inducing p27, GADD45,
and BIM gene expression, respectively (27, 37, 38). In breast cancer
patients, inactive cytoplasmic FOXO3a expression correlates with
poor survival (39). Inhibition of FOXO3a increases tumorigenesis
in nude mice (39). Although the overall antitumor effect of FOXO3a
is likely mediated through the combination of mechanisms, our
data suggest that FOXO3a contributes through the activation of

the ERa/MTA3/E-cadherin pathway. Recently, it was reported that
FOXM1, another forkhead protein, interacts with FOXO3a and
cooperatively regulates ERa expression (36). It remains to be
determined how this interaction affects invasive phenotype.
The mechanism we report here extends the known ability of
EGCG to promote a more epithelial phenotype via its antioxidative
activity. Tumor cells produce large amounts of reactive oxygen
species (ROS), which leads to the induction of matrix metalloproteinases that promote invasion and metastasis (40, 41). The
antioxidative activity of green tea polyphenols was found to
potently inhibit many matrix proteinases (42–44). ROS scavengers
have been seen to inhibit FOXO3a induction (45), suggesting ROS is
capable of inducing FOXO3a. The observed activation of FOXO3a
by EGCG likely occurs via a mechanism that is independent of its
antioxidative activity. Interestingly, FOXO proteins have been
shown to protect from oxidative damage–induced apoptosis by
inducing the antioxidant enzymes MnSOD and catalase (46).
Whether induction of MnSOD by FOXO3a contributes to the
inhibition of an invasive phenotype remains to be determined.
In summary, our study offers a novel molecular understanding of
the observed anticarcinogenic effect of green tea. EGCG possesses
potent anti-invasive activity by activating the FOXO3a/ERa/MTA3/
E-cadherin pathway. Substantial anticarcinogenic effects have been
seen in studies in animal drinking doses comparable to 3 to 10 cups
daily (reviewed in ref. 1). Green tea extracts potently reduce (87%)
invasive phenotype of mammary tumors induced by DMBA in S-D
rats (5). Oral infusion of a polyphenolic fraction isolated from green
tea significantly inhibited prostate cancer development and
increased survival of TRAMP mice (6). A study in Japan has found
that drinking green tea, at the level used in these animal studies,
reduced the risk of recurrence in women with stage I and II breast
cancer (3). Thus, green tea and EGCG offer attractive antitumorigenic agents that can be easily and safely incorporated into daily
lives.
