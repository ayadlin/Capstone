Abstract
Medulloblastoma is the most common malignant brain tumor in children. This disease is heterogeneous and is
composed of four subtypes of medulloblastoma [WNT, Sonic Hedgehog (SHH), Group 3, and Group 4]. An
immediate goal is to identify novel molecular targets for the most aggressive forms of medulloblastoma. Polo-like
kinase 1 (PLK1) is an oncogenic kinase that controls cell cycle and proliferation, making it a strong candidate for
medulloblastoma treatment. In this study, pediatric medulloblastomas were subtyped in two patient cohorts
(discovery cohort, n ¼ 63 patients; validation cohort, n ¼ 57 patients) using NanoString nCounter analysis and
PLK1 mRNA was assessed. We determined that the SHH and Group 3 subtypes were independently associated
with poor outcomes in children as was PLK1 using Cox regression analyses. Furthermore, we screened a library of
129 compounds in clinical trials using a model of pediatric medulloblastoma and determined that PLK1 inhibitors
were the most promising class of agents against the growth of medulloblastoma. In patient-derived primary
medulloblastoma isolates, the PLK1 small-molecule inhibitor BI2536 suppressed the self-renewal of cells with
high PLK1 but not low PLK1 expression. PLK1 inhibition prevented medulloblastoma cell proliferation, selfrenewal, cell-cycle progression, and induced apoptosis. In contrast, the growth of normal neural stem cells was
unaffected by BI2536. Finally, BI2536 extended survival in medulloblastoma-bearing mice with efﬁcacy comparable with Headstart, a standard-of-care chemotherapy regimen. We conclude that patients with medulloblastoma expressing high levels of PLK1 are at elevated risk. These preclinical studies pave the way for improving
the treatment of medulloblastoma through PLK1 inhibition. Cancer Res; 73(22); 6734–44. 2013 AACR.

entails maximal safe resection, whole brain and spinal cord
radiation for children older than 3, and aggressive chemotherapy. The advances in medical treatments have improved
patient survival from 5% in the 1960s (1) to more than 70%
for the standard-risk disease (2, 3). Yet, the 5-year survival rate
for the high-risk disease is still dismal (16%–70%; ref. 3), and
almost all survivors will inevitably suffer from adverse, lifelong
consequences from treatment. These undesirable effects are
attributable to the detrimental impacts that surgical procedures, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy have on the developing
brain (4). Therefore, there is an imperative need to identify
novel therapeutics that could improve the cure rate while
avoiding harmful side effects.
Medulloblastoma can be divided into four different molecular subtypes, namely, WNT, Sonic Hedgehog (SHH), Group 3,
and Group 4. These subtypes were originally described on the
basis of differences in gene expression using cDNA microarrays
(5), which were subsequently substantiated by immunohistochemistry (IHC; refs. 5, 6). Microarrays are problematic
because they require fresh snap-frozen tissues, whereas IHC
is hindered by the subjectivity of scoring and differential
staining across laboratories. Recently, mRNA-based assays
have been developed using the Nanostring nCounter system

Pediatric Medulloblastomas Depend upon PLK1 for Growth

to avoid some of the problems associated with prior methods
of classiﬁcation (5). Advantages of NanoString are as follows: (i)
multiple genes are used to distinguish medulloblastoma subtypes, (ii) it is highly quantitative, and (iii) it does not require
an ampliﬁcation step, allowing for low-abundance genes to
be detected from formalin-ﬁxed parafﬁn-embedded (FFPE)
tissues.
The medulloblastoma subtypes differ not only in genetic
signatures but also in response to clinical therapy (7). In
studies of medulloblastoma in which adult and pediatric
patients were evaluated collectively, the WNT molecular
subtype was associated with the best prognosis, whereas
the Group 3 tumors fair the poorest. The SHH and Group 4
tumors correlate with intermediate outcomes in studies that
captured adult and pediatric patients (5, 8). However, it is
not known whether the risk associated with each subtype
holds true when the cohort is solely composed of pediatric
patients.
Extensive insights into the biology of the SHH pathway have
spearheaded signiﬁcant progress into the development of
related targeted therapies, notably to Smoothened (SMO) for
which there are several open clinical trials (9). There are
already reports of acquired resistance due to point mutations
in SMO (10), ampliﬁcation in GLI2 (11), and signaling through
the PI3K pathway (12). It is therefore possible that other signal
transduction pathways may provide alternative approaches
to the management of medulloblastoma. The identiﬁcation
of targeted therapies for Group 3 and Group 4 tumors also
remains a challenge. We provide clinical and preclinical evidence suggesting that Polo-like kinase 1 (PLK1) is a provocative
molecular target for pediatric medulloblastoma that transcends molecular subtypes.

Materials and Methods
Medulloblastoma patient cohorts
Primary medulloblastoma samples were obtained from
BC Children's Hospital (Vancouver, BC, Canada; discovery)
and The Hospital for Sick Children (Toronto, ON; validation).
In the discovery cohort, we obtained 75 tumor blocks from
patients diagnosed with medulloblastoma between 1986 and
2012. The samples included both primary and relapse specimens; however, only primary samples were assessed in this
study. Medical charts were reviewed and pertinent clinicopathologic data were recorded (R. Rassekh, K. O'Halloran,
and C. Foster). Patient ages ranged from 3 months to 16.8
years; a review of this cohort is shown in Supplementary
Table S1. Twelve of 75 patients were excluded from survival
analysis. Three patient samples were retrospectively found
to be misdiagnoses, and 9 other patients received a treatment regimen conﬂicting with the standard-of-care. Dr.
Michael D. Taylor from The Hospital for SickKids, University
of Toronto, generously provided the validation cohort of 61
patients with medulloblastoma (Supplementary Table S2).
Four of 61 patients were excluded from survival analysis for
the purpose of homogeneity of treatment. All tumors were
subtyped and the data were analyzed according to Northcott
and colleagues (13).

NanoString nCounter gene expression proﬁling
RNA was extracted from three 20-mm scrolls of FFPE tissue
using the Qiagen RNeasy FFPE Kit. Exactly 250 ng of RNA was
run for each patient sample and RNA quality was assessed
using Nanodrop spectrometry. A 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent
Technologies) was used to spot-check RNA quality in random
samples. Medulloblastoma cell lines were grown as tumorspheres, and subsequent mRNA analysis was performed in
a similar manner to the FFPE tissues. Analysis using the
nCounter Gene Expression system was conducted at the
Centre for Translational and Applied Genomics (BC Cancer
Agency, Vancouver, BC, Canada). A custom codeset synthesized by NanoString Technologies was designed, which included 22 medulloblastoma-speciﬁc subtyping gene probes (13)
plus other genes of interest that speciﬁcally included PLK1
(NM_005030.3). The recommendations outlined by NanoString
Technologies were all followed for sample preparation, hybridization, detection, scanning, and data normalization.
Gene expression and subtype assignment analysis
NanoString gene expression data were analyzed as previously described (8, 13–15). Cell lines (grown as neurospheres)
and xenograft tumor tissues were assigned subgroup classiﬁcation using the 72-patient cohort as a training set. Cutoff
points for PLK1 expression were assigned on the basis of z
score deviation from the mean expression of the cohort. PLK1
transcript counts fewer than 400 (per 250 ng patient RNA) were
considered low in expression. Heatmaps were generated using
unsupervised hierarchical clustering with average linkage
using Cluster version 3.0 and Treeview version 1.60.
Immunoﬂuorescence
Immunoﬂuorescence staining was performed on Daoy cells
according to the procedure we previously described (16).
Primary antibodies include a-tubulin (ab18251; Abcam), Pericentrin (ab28144; Abcam), anti-P-H2AXS139 (ab26350; Abcam),
and PARP (Cell Signaling Technology). Images were taken using
an Olympus FV10i confocal microscope on 60 magniﬁcation.
Drug library screen
The small-molecule–targeted therapeutic agents were synthesized, purity checked, and purchased from ChemieTek. The
Daoy cell line was seeded (3,000 cells/well) overnight and then
treated with 1 and 10 mmol/L for 72 hours. Cells were ﬁxed
in 2% paraformaldehyde and stained with Hoechst 33342
(1 mg/mL; Sigma-Aldrich. Analysis was done with the ArrayScan
high-content screening system (Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc).
Cell culture and tumorsphere growth
Daoy cells were obtained from the American Type Culture
Collection. Primary brain tumor cells were isolated from
BTX001 (SHH), BT006 (SHH), BT007 (SHH), BT008 (PNET),
BT014 (Group 4), BT274 (SHH), and BT025 (Group 4) and were
grown as neurospheres as previously described (17) using
Neurocult media (StemCell Technologies; ref. 18). All primary
cells were obtained through informed consent in abidance
with the respective research ethics board guidelines at British
Columbia Children's Hospital and The Hospital for Sick

Children. A single-cell suspension of Daoy and patient-derived
primary medulloblastoma cells (BTX001, BT274, BT014, and
BT025) were plated in tumorsphere assays as previously
described (18). Tumorspheres, plated in triplicate more than
50 mm, were quantiﬁed and photomicrographs were taken
after 6 days of culture.
Transfection and western blotting
siRNA transfections were performed using Lipofectamine
RNAiMAX (Invitrogen) as previously described (19). Immunoblotting was conducted using anti-PLK1 (Sigma-Aldrich),
anti-P-CDC25CSer198, anti-P-TCTPSer46, and anti-pan-actin
(Cell Signaling Technology). Band densitometry was measured
using ImageJ, v1.46r and normalized to actin.
Cell-cycle analysis
Cell-cycle analysis was done following 24-hour siRNA or
BI2536 treatment using ﬂow cytometry as described by Lee and
colleagues (2012) (18). Histone H3 phosphorylation was tested
as previously described using P-histone H3ser10 (Cell Signaling
Technology; ref. 20).
Annexin V staining and quantiﬁcation of cell growth by
Hoechst staining
Daoy cells were treated with 2.5 nmol/L BI2536 for 48 hours
and stained with Annexin V (Promega) as previously described (21). To evaluate the effect of PLK1 inhibition on cell
growth, Daoy or human neural stem cells (hNSC; H9, hESCderived, GIBCO) were also plated (3,000 cell/well) in 96-well
plates following previously outlined methods (19, 21).
In vivo evaluation of BI2536 compared with
chemotherapy
Xenografts from Daoy cell lines were injected into the right
frontal lobe of NOD-CB17-SCID mouse brains according to
Research Ethics Board–approved protocols (n ¼ 18). Mice were
injected with biologic replicates consisting of 106 single-cell
suspensions and randomly divided into three treatment groups
(n ¼ 6) following engraftment of orthotopic tumors: control
(0.1N HCl), chemotherapy (vincristine, cisplatin, and cyclophosphamide), and treatment (BI2536). Intraperitoneal injections were performed for delivery of all study-group agents. The
control group consisted of one weekly injection of 0.1N HCl for
4 weeks. The chemotherapy group modeled a Headstart protocol that consisted of one weekly injection of vincristine (1.05
mg/kg) and cisplatin (2.5 mg/kg) on day 1 followed by cyclophosphamide (0.0352 mg/kg) on day 2 for 3 weeks. The
treatment group consisted of one weekly injection of BI2536
(62.5 mg/kg, diluted in 0.1N HCl) for 4 weeks. The mice were
observed until they displayed obvious signs of neurologic
deﬁcits and appeared unwell. Tumors were removed at the
end of the study, FFPE, and stained with hematoxylin and
eosin. The histopathologic diagnosis of the tumors was evaluated by a pediatric neuropathologist (C. Dunham).
Statistical analysis
All quantitative data presented were analyzed as mean value

2D modeling of dimensionality reduction of the 22 subtyping
genes (8, 13) using Partek Genomics Suite (Partek). For the
tissue microarray, clinical survival analysis, and animal studies,
log-rank analysis was performed on the Kaplan–Meier curve to
determine statistical signiﬁcance of the results. Multivariate
survival analysis was conducted using Cox regression proportional hazards and a 95% conﬁdence interval (CI). All survival
analyses and the Spearman's rank correlation test were done
using SPSS version 20.0 statistical software (IBM). The number
of samples used and the respective P-values are listed in the
ﬁgure legends. The level of signiﬁcance for the in vitro cell
growth/death data was determined by a Student two-tailed
t test and the difference in PLK1 expression between subtypes
was assessed using one-way ANOVA ( , P < 0.05;  , P < 0.01).

Results
Medulloblastoma tumor samples were assigned molecular
subtype classiﬁcation using gene expression data and PAM class
predication statistical software (Supplementary Tables S3 and
S4). On the basis of these subtypes, patients with SHH and Group
3 tumors had high probabilities of relapse (Fig. 1A) and death
(Fig. 1B). Children with WNT or Group 4 tumors relapsed less
frequently and lived longer (Fig. 1A and B); this was also seen in a
separate validation cohort (Supplementary Fig. S1A and S1B).
In the discovery cohort, a heatmap of the patient gene expression illustrates the subtype distribution and includes the patient
tumors from which tissue specimens were collected for primary
cell culture (Fig. 1C). These data prompted us to address
whether there may be drugs in clinical trials for adult cancers
that would be beneﬁcial for combating SHH type tumors in
children; therefore, we subtyped four medulloblastoma cell lines
(ONS76, UW228, UW426, and Daoy). Using the 22 established
medulloblastoma subtyping genes from Northcott and colleagues (13), each of the cell lines clustered most similarly to the
SHH patient subgroup, following both hierarchical clustering
(Fig. 1C and Supplementary Fig. S1C) and PCA analysis (Fig. 1D).
This classiﬁcation was veriﬁed using PAM (PAM-SHH ¼ 1.0E þ
00; Supplementary Table S3) and was conﬁrmed again using
analysis in which the validation cohort acted as the data training
set (data not shown; refs. 13, 14). Subsequently, we conducted a
drug library screen in Daoy cells against 129 drugs, most of
which are in clinical trials. To be carried forward, compounds
had to meet speciﬁc criteria: (i) 70% growth inhibition, (ii)
activity at 1 mmol/L and more so with 10 mmol/L, (iii) potential
to cross the blood–brain barrier, (iv) currently in clinical trials,
and (iv) novelty. Initially, 11 of 129 compounds partially fulﬁlled
these criteria. Some compounds had shown toxicity in clinical
trials or were previously studied. Therefore, we chose to pursue
PLK1 because of its relative novelty as a target and the 90%
growth inhibition efﬁcacy demonstrated by the PLK1 inhibitor
group: BI6727, BI2536, and GSK461364 (Fig. 2A).
In patients, PLK1 levels were compared with normal cerebellum. PLK1 mRNA was higher in the vast majority of medulloblastoma than in normal cerebellum using the nCounter system
(P < 0.001; Fig. 2B and Supplementary Fig. S2A). There was
no signiﬁcant difference in PLK1 expression among the four
medulloblastoma subtypes (Supplementary Fig. S2B). The

mRNA expression of PLK1 was associated with higher rates of
relapse and poor survival as shown in a Kaplan–Meier univariate analysis (Fig. 2C). In the validation cohort, PLK1 mRNA
levels were also predicative of outcome (Fig. 2D). There was
no signiﬁcant difference in the overall survival outcomes or
PLK1 expression between the study cohorts (Supplementary
Fig. S2C).
Multivariate survival analyses of the discovery and validation cohorts are shown in Table 1 and Supplementary Table S5,
respectively. The variables identiﬁed as independent factors
affecting patient survival include presence of metastasis (HR,
3.920; 95% CI, 1.083–14.198), having an SHH medulloblastoma
(HR, 9.982; 95% CI, 1.587–62.765), a Group 3 medulloblastoma
(HR, 8.874; 95% CI, 1.778–44.283), and expression of PLK1 (HR,

7.286; 95% CI, 1.469–36.142). Likewise, having SHH medulloblastoma, Group 3 medulloblastoma, and expression of PLK1
were also signiﬁcant in the validation cohort (Supplementary
Table S5). Younger patients often do poorly as protocols for
children younger than age 3 avoid radiotherapy (22). This
brings us to question whether cases not receiving radiotherapy
had even worse outcomes (22). Age and radiotherapy treatment were signiﬁcantly associated with univariate survival
analysis, but were not independent prognostic markers in the
multivariate analysis. In addition, clinical characteristics such
as sex, extent of resection, and chemotherapy were not significant variables associated with survival in the log-rank test
(Table 1). Neither age nor radiotherapy was signiﬁcant in the
validation cohort (Supplementary Table S5).

Primary patient–derived medulloblastoma cells were obtained from surgical specimens and grown as tumorspheres
(BTX001, BT014, BT016, and BT025). RNA was extracted from
cultured tumorspheres and compared with matched FFPE
sections from the original tumor whereby their gene expression
was characterized using nanoString. Cultured primary cells
retained subtype and PLK1 expression patterns of the original
tumors. This is exempliﬁed with BTX001, BT016 (Fig. 3A), and
BT025 (Supplementary Fig. S3A). Interestingly, PLK1 mRNA was
higher in BTX001 than in normal cerebellum (CB) or hNSC by
qRT-PCR (Fig. 3B) and BI2536 BTX001 hindered self-renewal
upon serial passaging (Fig. 3C). In contrast, BT014 and BT025
cells were derived from Group 4 tumors that expressed low
levels of PLK1 (Fig. 3B and Supplementary Fig. S3B) and they
were not responsive to BI2536 (Fig. 3C and Supplementary
Fig. S3C). Importantly, the growth effects of hNSCs were negligible when screened with BI2536 as an in vitro evaluation for
the safety (Fig. 3D). Expression of PLK1 mRNA in additional

expression was also comparable with the primary medulloblastoma freshly isolated from patients (Supplementary Fig. S3D).
PLK1 inhibition with siRNA suppressed the Daoy growth by
approximately 90% in 72 hours (Fig. 4A and B). Deactivation of
PLK1 activity was conﬁrmed by downregulation of phosphorylation of its direct substrate, translationally controlled tumor
protein (TCTP), by approximately 80% (Fig. 4A; refs. 23, 24). PLK1
levels expressed in Daoy cells were similar to the levels found in
poor prognosis of patients with medulloblastoma (Supplementary Fig. S4A). Likewise, PLK1 protein and mRNA expression was
detected in two additional medulloblastoma cell lines ONS76
and UW426 (Supplementary Fig. S4A and S4B), which were
equally sensitive to PLK1 inhibition (Supplementary Fig. S4C).
As expected, BI2536 suppressed phosphorylation of the known
PLK1 substrates TCTP and CDC25C and reduced cell growth
with an IC90 of 5 nmol/L at 72 hours (Fig. 4B). BI2536 treatment
at 24 hours halted the cell cycle and caused G2–M arrest with
observable compromised cell cycle and division as shown by
immunoﬂuorescence staining (Fig. 4C and Supplementary Fig.
S4D). PLK1 inhibition in Daoy cells resulted in irregular centrosome duplication and separation with many cells appearing

polynucleated relative to control treatments (Fig. 4C and Supplementary Fig. S5). Both siPLK1 and BI2536 treatments induced
apoptosis at 48 hours (Fig. 4D) and self-renewal was abolished
with 10 nmol/L BI2536 (Supplementary Fig. S6A).
Daoy and two additional medulloblastoma cell lines
responded to chemotherapeutic agents (vincristine, cisplatin,
and etoposide) that are used for medulloblastoma treatment
(Fig. 5A and Supplementary Fig. S6B). Therefore, we used an
animal model to compare the in vivo efﬁcacy of BI2536 with the
conventional chemotherapy using a chemotherapy commonly
used in protocol. BI2536 delayed medulloblastoma tumor
growth and was comparable with standard-of-care chemotherapy protocols (Fig. 5B). It is important to note that the
histomorphology of the Daoy xenografts in our NOD-CB17SCID mice was also similar to large cell anaplastic (LCA)
medulloblastoma (Fig. 5C). This is consistent with a study

6740

Cancer Res; 73(22) November 15, 2013

reported by Shu and colleagues (25), in which the Daoy cells
were injected intracranially into Rag2 severe combined immunodeﬁcient (SCID) mice. LCA histology is often an indication of
poor survival in both SHH and Group 3 medulloblastoma (15).
The xenografts were then compared with patient-derived
medulloblastoma. Notably, their gene signature grouped with
patients with SHH subtype (Fig. 5D). The SHH stem cell gene
SOX2 (26) was consistently expressed, as was GLI2 another
transcription factor involved in SHH signaling.

Discussion
Children diagnosed with medulloblastoma were more likely
to relapse and die if their tumor was classiﬁed in either the
Group 3 or SHH subtype. This differs somewhat to previously
published studies reporting SHH as an intermediate prognosis
(5, 7) and we suspect that this could be due to differences in

the way patients are treated, such as avoiding radiotherapy
in younger patients and/or the composition of the patient
cohort. In our study, we only included pediatric medulloblastoma, whereas other reports also included adult tumors
(5). Furthermore, the SHH subtype in children and adults is
associated with different outcomes (15). One of the limitations of our study was the availability of fresh primary tumor
tissue from different subtypes. Although only SHH and
Group 4 tumors were available to culture during this study's
duration, we, nonetheless, hypothesize that our ﬁndings
have major clinical implications for many medulloblastomas, given that PLK1 overexpression is prevalent and cuts
across molecular subtypes. As we continue culturing incoming patient cells we will extend our study to test our ﬁndings
in more medulloblastoma.

PLK1 is an oncogenic kinase that confers a growth and
survival advantage in cancer cells through its central role in
mitosis (27). In multiple cancer models, PLK1 inhibition speciﬁcally eliminates the malignant cells while leaving the nonmalignant cells unharmed (28–30). Furthermore, PLK1 is highly
expressed in cancer cells but not in their normal cell counterparts (31, 32), rendering this kinase a particularly attractive
molecular target for cancer therapeutics. Our study tests the
PLK1 small-molecule inhibitor, BI2536, which has been evaluated in patients with cancer (33, 34). Various other small
molecule inhibitors to PLK1 have been designed and evaluated
in phase I/II clinical trials including BI2536, BI6727, Rigosertib,
and GSK461364 (35–39). None of these trials have speciﬁcally
addressed the possibility that PLK1 inhibitors may be beneﬁcial
for the treatment of brain tumors. Our group has demonstrated

that PLK1 inhibitors could be used to target glioblastoma
(18, 40) and another group has published data agreeing with
our ﬁndings in medulloblastoma (41, 42). We illustrate that
PLK1 is a promising drug target for medulloblastoma because
(i) it is highly expressed in tumors relative to normal brain
tissues and (ii) there are small molecule inhibitors that suppress
primary medulloblastoma cells and cell lines in vitro and in vivo.
In conclusion, patients that have tumors expressing very
high levels of PLK1 are considered to be at elevated risk for
relapse and death. Because there are several PLK1 inhibitors in
clinical trials for adult malignancies, we propose that these
drugs may also provide beneﬁt for selected patients with
medulloblastoma. In the future, it will be desirable to personalize the treatment of medulloblastoma by selecting patients
with high PLK1 using accurate, sensitive methods such as that
of the NanoString nCounter technology, in which subgroup
afﬁliation of tumors can be assigned rapidly and reproducibly
(13). Furthermore, we anticipate that PLK1 inhibitors may have
fewer detrimental side effects, as it is not expressed at high

levels in normal brain tissue. Therefore, it could be a great
improvement to many of the chemotherapies currently being
used that can often cause long-term adverse effects (43). These
preclinical studies pave the way for improving the treatment
of medulloblastoma through PLK1 inhibition.
