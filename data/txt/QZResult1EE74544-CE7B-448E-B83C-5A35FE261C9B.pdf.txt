BACKGROUND: Use of progression-free survival (PFS) as a clinical trial endpoint in first-line treatment of patients with metastatic urothelial carcinoma (UC)
is attractive, but would be enhanced by establishing a correlation between PFS and overall survival (OS). METHODS: Data was pooled from 7 phase 2
and 3 trials evaluating cisplatin-based chemotherapy in metastatic UC. An independent cohort of patients enrolled on a phase 3 trial
was used for external validation. Landmark analyses for progression at 6 and 9 months after treatment initiation were performed to
minimize lead-time bias. A proportional hazards model was used to assess the utility of PFS for predicting OS. RESULTS: A total of
364 patients were included in the initial cohort. The median PFS was 8.21 months (95% confidence interval 5 7.43, 8.39) and the median OS was 13.50 months (95% confidence interval 5 11.80, 15.67). In the landmark analysis, the median OS for patients who progressed at 6 months was 3.87 months compared with 15.06 months for those patients who did not progress (P <.0001) and the
median OS for patients who progressed at 9 months was 5.65 months compared with 21.39 months for those patients who did not
progress (P <.0001). A Fleischer model demonstrated a statistically significant dependent correlation between PFS and OS. The findings were externally validated in an independent cohort. CONCLUSIONS: PFS at 6 and 9 months predicted OS in this analysis of
patients with metastatic UC treated with first-line cisplatin-based chemotherapy and could potentially serve as endpoints in (randomC 2013 American Cancer Society.

INTRODUCTION
Metastatic urothelial cancer (UC) is a chemosensitive disease. With contemporary cisplatin-based combination chemotherapy, approximately 50% to 60% of patients will achieve an objective response to treatment and approximately 10% to
20% will achieve a complete response.1,2 Despite these relatively high response proportions in the context of other solid
tumors treated with cytotoxic agents, response durations in metastatic UC are generally short-lived, and median overall
survival is only approximately 14 months.2 Recent attempts to improve contemporary cisplatin-based regimens have
proven unsuccessful, with no advances in the efficacy of therapy in the past 30 years.3
The relatively high response rates achieved with first-line cisplatin-based chemotherapy in metastatic UC has created
a challenge with regard to appropriate endpoints for phase 2 trials exploring novel therapeutic regimens. A high barrier
must be overcome to detect a signal of enhanced antitumor activity (as measured by objective response rate) compared
with historical controls.4 At the same time, tumor response rate has not convincingly proven useful in selecting phase 2
regimens worthy of moving forward to definitive randomized trials in this clinical disease state, likely contributing to the
lack of progress in drug development.5
Alternatively, time-to-event endpoints, particularly progression-free survival (PFS) endpoints,6 may be preferable to
screen the activity of novel first-line treatment regimens in metastatic UC. PFS offers the potential to encompass an aspect

PFS and OS in Metastatic UC/Galsky et al

Each protocol required a histologic or cytologic diagnosis of UC. The pretreatment evaluations were similar among
the protocols and included a complete history and physical
examination and laboratory testing including a complete
blood cell and platelet count, renal function, and hepatic function. Imaging studies were performed at baseline and every 6
to 12 weeks on treatment, depending on the study. Response
assessments were performed by using either World Health Organization (WHO) criteria8 or Response Evaluation Criteria
in Solid Tumors (RECIST),9 and toxicity assessments were
performed by using either WHO criteria or the National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria.

of “disease control” not captured by focusing on tumor
shrinkage alone. Compared with overall survival (OS) endpoints, PFS endpoints generally occur months to years earlier, particularly when evaluated at a fixed time point,
shortening timelines for clinical trial completion, and also
minimizing the risk of possible benefits being diluted as
effective salvage regimens are introduced. There are multiple
barriers to drug development in advanced UC, including
inadequate funding and repeated difficulty with trial accrual
and/or completion,7 and one can only speculate whether
PFS-based endpoints could have identified active regimens
that have since been abandoned. However, such endpoints
may still facilitate more efficient drug development moving
forward. In this context, understanding the relationship
between PFS and OS, and establishing benchmarks of PFS
at fixed time points, is critical to inform future drug evaluation and clinical trial design. In this study, we explored these
issues in a pooled analysis of patients enrolled on phase 2
and 3 trials evaluating first-line, cisplatin-based, combination chemotherapy in metastatic UC.

Statistical Analysis

Individual patient data were collected from the principal
investigators of each trial. The primary endpoint for the
current analysis was OS, defined as the time from treatment initiation to the date of death from any cause, or
censored at the last follow-up. PFS was defined as the
time from treatment initiation until the time of disease
progression or death or was censored at the last follow-up.
Landmark analysis of PFS at 6 months and 9
months after treatment initiation was performed to minimize lead-time bias. These time points were selected on
the basis of the published historical median PFS of
patients with metastatic UC treated with first-line cisplatin-based chemotherapy.3 Patients who died before 6 or 9
months were excluded in the 6-month landmark analysis
or the 9-month landmark analysis, respectively, to provide
the most conservative estimate of effect.
The method of Kaplan and Meier was used to estimate the OS of patients stratified by disease progression at
6 or 9 months. A proportional hazards model was used to
assess the significance of progression at 6 or 9 months in
predicting OS when adjusted for prognostic factors.10,11
The proportionality assumption was met by graphically
assessing plots of log (2log[survival]) versus log of

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Inclusion Criteria

The initial cohort included 399 patients with unresectable
and/or metastatic urothelial carcinoma enrolled on 7
phase 2 and 3 trials exploring first-line, cisplatin-based,
combination chemotherapy from 1998 to 2011. A cohort
of 186 patients enrolled on a phase 3 study comparing
MVAC (methotrexate, vinblastine, doxorubicin, and cisplatin) with docetaxel plus cisplatin in patients with metastatic UC (patients enrolled from 1997 to 2002) was used
for external validation. The details of each trial are provided in Table 1 and have been presented or published
previously. Each study was approved by the institutional
review board at the participating institutions and
informed consent was obtained before treatment.

survival time. The case deletion method was used to handle missing values in all explanatory variables.
The correlation between PFS and OS was estimated
using the statistical model for dependence between PFS
and OS developed by Fleischer et al.12 The Fleischer
approach models the maximal independence between OS
and PFS by modeling the time to progression and OS as
independent events, and PFS is the minimum of time to
progression or OS. This maximal independence model,
with the hazard rate for time to progression (k1) independent of OS time, is further generalized so that the hazard rate for OS after progression (k3) is a different hazard
rate from the one experienced before progression (k2).

The standard errors of the correlation statistics were
estimated using the bootstrap method with 300 replications. The bootstrap confidence intervals were computed
based on the percentiles of the bootstrap distribution of
the statistic. For the landmark analysis, 300 bootstrap
samples were generated similarly at each landmark time
point.
RESULTS
Baseline Characteristics

Of the 399 patients in the initial cohort, 35 patients were
excluded due to either missing date of last follow-up
(n 5 11), date of treatment initiation (n 5 4), or progression status (n 5 20). Therefore, the study population consisted of 364 patients. At the time of the analysis, 292
patients had progressed and 255 had died. Of the 186
patients in the validation cohort, 5 patients were excluded
due to either missing progression status (n 5 4) or date of
progression (n 5 1). Therefore, the validation study population consisted of 181 patients. At the time of the analysis, 161 patients had progressed and 170 had died. The
baseline characteristics of patients in both cohorts are
detailed in Table 2.
Landmark Analysis

In the landmark analysis of the initial cohort, the median
OS for patients who progressed at 6 months, compared
with those patients who did not, was 3.87 months versus
15.06 months, respectively. OS was significantly better
for patients who were progression-free at 6 months (logrank test, P < .0001; Fig. 1A). For those who progressed
at 9 months, compared with those patients who did not,
the median OS was 5.65 months versus 21.39 months,
respectively. OS was significantly better for patients who

were progression-free at 9 months (log-rank test,
P < .0001; Fig. 1B). For patients who progressed at 6 and
9 months, compared with those who did not progress, the
hazard ratios (HRs) for death adjusted for known baseline
adverse prognostic factors (presence of visceral metastases
and performance status) were 2.49 (95% confidence
interval [CI] 5 1.55, 3.89) and 2.84 (95% CI 5 1.81,
4.24), respectively (Table 3). Bootstrap analyses performed at 6 months and 9 months produced very similar
HRs, confirming the validity of the results. In addition,
the findings were externally validated in an independent
cohort (Table 3).
Correlation Analysis

For patients in the initial cohort (n 5 364), the median
PFS was 8.21 months (95% CI 5 7.43, 8.39) and the median OS was 13.50 months (95% CI 5 11.80, 15.67).

Figure 1. Kaplan-Meier curves illustrate landmark analyses for
overall survival according to progression status at (A) 6
months and (B) 9 months.

The median postprogression survival for patients who
progressed prior to death was 5.09 months (95%
CI 5 4.27, 5.95). By using the Fleischer model, the estimated correlation between PFS and OS was 0.86 (bootstrap standard error of 0.001, 95% CI 5 0.82, 0.90). This
means that approximately 74% of the variability in OS
can be explained by PFS (bootstrap standard error of
0.002, 95% CI 5 0.67, 0.81).
DISCUSSION
There have been no improvements in the efficacy of firstline treatment for patients with metastatic UC since the
introduction of cisplatin-based combination chemotherapy regimens in the 1980s.2,3,13 The lack of progress in
this disease is almost certainly multifactorial, but may be
linked to disease biology, inadequate funding for research,

lack of interest from investigators and industry, and poor
accrual to clinical trials. Phase 2 efforts over the past few
decades have focused on small trials, with response rate as
a primary endpoint, which have been extremely difficult
to interpret with regard to a “go/no-go” decision, and
have not clearly moved the field forward.
The relatively high response rates, yet inadequate
response durations, achieved with cisplatin-based chemotherapy for metastatic UC suggest that time-to-event endpoints may be particularly well suited for studies in this
clinical disease state.6 The increasing integration of
“targeted” agents with potential cytostatic effects, into
conventional cytotoxic regimens, further underscores this
point. Use of PFS at a fixed time point (eg, 6-month PFS)
as an intermediate endpoint is ideally informed by
“benchmarking” of PFS from a large cohort of patients
treated with cisplatin-based combination chemotherapy
regimens and by understanding the relationship between
PFS and OS. The current analysis reveals a median PFS of
7.75 months (95% CI 5 7.06, 8.18) in a diverse
population of patients with metastatic UC treated with
cisplatin-based combination chemotherapy. In the landmark analyses at the 6- and 9-month time points, patients
who progressed had a 2.5- to 2.8-fold increased risk of
dying compared with patients at the same time point who
remained progression-free, even when controlling for
known prognostic factors. A significant positive relation
between PFS and OS was observed as demonstrated by
the Fleischer model (0.86).
These findings raise the important consideration of
whether 6- or 9-month PFS should be considered appropriate endpoints for phase 2 trials in chemotherapy-naive
patients with metastatic UC, and if so, in what context?
The use of PFS as an endpoint for phase 2 trials has been
proposed in multiple other malignancies.14-16 However,
there are clear limitations to the use of PFS in phase 2 trials, particularly with regards to the generally problematic
comparison with “historical controls.”
Two general strategies have been proposed to minimize these limitations.17 First, large data sets demonstrating that PFS has been highly reproducible in multiple
prior studies might provide sufficient justification for use
of PFS as an endpoint, even in single-arm phase 2 studies.
In the current study, analysis of the percentage of patients
progression-free at 6 and 9 months across the 8 clinical trials (spanning approximately 13 years) reveals relatively
similar findings, with overlapping confidence intervals,
though ample variation is observed to suggest that singlearm phase 2 trials could still be prone to misinterpretation
(Table 4).18 Importantly, concerns regarding comparisons

to historical controls are not unique to PFS endpoints and
similarly exist for single-arm trials in this clinical disease
state that have employed response rate as a primary endpoint. Second, randomized phase 2 trials can be considered to mitigate the risk of inadvertent selection bias.
Such trial designs, in an effort to build on cisplatin-based
first-line treatment regimens are attractive, but clearly
require greater patient and financial resources. Nonetheless, these resources are likely well invested if such designs
minimize the risk of inappropriately discarding an effective regimen or prevent initiation of a large, costly phase 3
program for an ineffective regimen.19

studies used WHO criteria whereas the other half used
RECIST, and the definitions for disease progression differ
slightly between these response assessment criteria. However, prior studies have shown that these different
response assessment systems are highly concordant,
including in the assessment of progression.20,21 Despite
these different assessment criteria, PFS was still highly correlated with OS and was externally validated in an independent data set. Although the data were initially
collected prospectively, this is a retrospective study pooled
from a series of diverse phase 2 and 3 trials exploring a variety of cisplatin-based treatment regimens. However, the
multiple regimens employed in this analysis potentially
increase the generalizability of the findings. The timing of
restaging assessments was not uniform across all studies,
but the landmark time points selected coincided with
restaging evaluation time points in 7 of the 8 studies
included, and the use of the landmark analyses mitigate
the impact of this heterogeneity.
The current study was not designed to, nor establishes, 6- or 9-month PFS as a surrogate for OS.22 However, there are statistical and operational differences
between intermediate and surrogate endpoints. Intermediate endpoints, events, or biomarkers that are early precursors to a given outcome need not necessarily fulfill the
statistical criteria for “surrogacy”22 to serve as useful tools
for screening the activity of regimens in the phase 2 setting
and prioritizing such regimens for definitive evaluation.
Surrogate endpoints, on the other hand, must fully capture the net effect of treatment on the clinical outcome of
interest and as a result, may substitute for such outcomes

in phase 3 trials as a basis for regulatory agency approval.
Several steps, as outlined by Prentice,22 would ultimately
be required to establish 6- and 9-month PFS as surrogate
endpoints, and prospective integration of this analysis
should be considered in future phase 3 trials. Notably,
prior simulations suggest that the short median survival
after progression observed in the current analysis makes
dilution of OS improvements due to postprogression
therapies unlikely in metastatic UC.23
The current study reveals that 6- and 9-month PFS
is highly correlated with OS in metastatic UC. Furthermore, this study provides benchmarks for 6- and 9-month
PFS endpoints for future clinical trial design. Phase 2
(randomized) trials, using 6- or 9-month PFS as a primary
endpoint, may overcome many of the limitations of
current phase 2 clinical trial design in patients with
chemotherapy-naive metastatic UC and better inform
“go/no-go” decisions in this clinical disease state moving
forward.
