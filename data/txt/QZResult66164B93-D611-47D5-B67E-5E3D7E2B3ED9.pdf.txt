Histone Methyltransferase MLL1 Regulates MDR1
Transcription and Chemoresistance

Abstract
The multidrug resistance 1 gene (MDR1) encodes P-glycoprotein (Pgp), a member of the ATP-binding
cassette (ABC) transporter family that confers tumor drug resistance by actively effluxing a number of
antitumor agents. We had previously shown that MDR1 transcription is regulated by epigenetic events such
as histone acetylation, and had identified the histone acetylase P/CAF and the transcription factor NF-Y as
the factors mediating the enzymatic and DNA-anchoring functions, respectively, at the MDR1 promoter. It
has also been shown that MDR1 activation is accompanied by increased methylation on lysine 4 of histone
H3 (H3K4). In this study, we further investigated histone methylation in MDR1 regulation and function. We
show that the mixed lineage leukemia 1 (MLL1) protein, a histone methyltransferase specific for H3K4, is
required for MDR1 promoter methylation, as knockdown of MLL1 resulted in a decrease in MDR1 expression. The regulation of MDR1 by MLL1 has functional consequences in that downregulation of MLL1 led to
increased retention of the Pgp-specific substrate DIOC2(3), as well as increased cellular sensitivity to several
Pgp substrates. Regulation of MDR1 by MLL1 was dependent on the CCAAT box within the proximal MDR1
promoter, similar to what we had shown for MDR1 promoter acetylation, and also requires NF-Y. Finally,
overexpression of the most prevalent MLL fusion protein, MLL-AF4, led to increased MDR1 expression. This
is the first identification of a histone methyltransferase and its leukemogenic rearrangement that regulates
expression of an ABC drug transporter, suggesting a new target for circumvention of tumor multidrug
resistance. Cancer Res; 70(21); 8726–35. ©2010 AACR.

Introduction
It has been well established that chromatin regulates gene
expression through the dynamic modifications of histone residues. The repertoire of histone modifications includes acetylation, phosphorylation, methylation, sumolation, and
ubiquitination; the complex interplay of these chromatin
modifications establishes a “histone code” that serves as a
recognition and recruitment signal for other transcriptionmodifying proteins, thereby dictating the structure and function of the chromatin fiber and contributing to the activation
or repression of specific genes (1–3).
Our laboratory has had a long-standing interest in the
transcriptional regulation of the multidrug resistance 1 gene
(MDR1) in response to both external and internal stimuli.
The MDR1 gene product, P-glycoprotein (Pgp), is the best
studied member of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) family

of transporters, which also includes the MDR-associated proteins (MRP) and the breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP;
refs. 4, 5). Pgp was first identified due to its overexpression in
drug-resistant tumor cells, where it functions as a broad
range drug transporter, thereby conferring resistance to
many important chemotherapeutic agents including vinblastine, doxorubicin, and paclitaxel (4, 5). In addition to its welldescribed role as a mediator of tumor drug resistance, it has
been found in normal human tissues and has been implicated in the response of cells to more general apoptotic stimuli
(6), in the biodistribution of drugs (7, 8), and in the transport
of natural substances, including peptides, phospholipids,
cholesterol, and steroids (4, 9, 10). Given its varied and critical roles in both tumor and normal cells, it is not surprising
that the expression of Pgp is highly regulated from inception
to degradation.
We had previously shown that a variety of signaling pathways that lead to MDR1 activation are integrated by a MDR1
enhancesome that is anchored to the promoter via the DNA
binding proteins NF-Y and SP1, which interact with an inverted CCAAT box (-82 to -73) and GC box (-56 to -42), respectively (11, 12). More recently, we and others have shown
that histones associated with the MDR1 proximal promoter
are acetylated in response to multiple inducers (11, 13), and
that this acetylation is dependent on the recruitment of the
histone acetyltransferase P/CAF to the MDR1 enhancesome
through interaction with NF-Y (11). In the present study, we

Regulation of MDR1 Expression and Function by MLL1

continued to explore the role of chromatin modifications in
MDR1 expression by interrogating a role for histone methyltransferases in the regulation of this gene. Histone methylation, like histone acetylation, occurs on lysine residues
within histone tails and also plays a role in the recruitment
of multiple transcriptional effectors to specific promoters
(2). Although there are several potential methylation sites
within histone tails, there is a very strong correlation between the degree of trimethylation on lysine 4 of histone
H3 (H3K4me3) at the 5′ ends of genes and their transcription rate, RNA polymerase II occupancy, and histone
acetylation (2, 14, 15).
Herein we show that MDR1 H3K4 methylation is dependent on the methyltransferase mixed lineage leukemia 1
(MLL1), as knockdown of MLL1 decreased the constitutive
expression of MDR1, increased cellular retention of Pgp substrates, and sensitized cancer cells to chemotherapeutic
agents. Notably, a MLL fusion protein expressed in some
forms of leukemia also induced MDR1 expression; current
studies are directed at querying a correlation between
MDR1 expression and the expression of MLL1 fusion proteins
in leukemias that harbor these translocations. This is the first
identification of a histone methyltransferase that regulates a
member of the ABC family of drug transporters, and provides
a potential new target for modulation of anticancer drug sensitivity/resistance.

Materials and Methods
Cell lines
HeLa cells (CCL2, a human cervical adenocarcinoma cell
line) were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection, and grown in DMEM supplemented with10% fetal bovine
serum (FBS; Atlanta Biologicals). Phoenix amphotropic cells
were a gift from Dr. Dan R. Littman (New York University,
NY) and were grown in DMEM containing 10% FBS. Cells were
frozen down at an early passage, and were checked routinely for
mycoplasm contamination. Parental HEK 293 and Jurkat cells,
293- and Jurkat-MLL-AF4 Tet-on cell lines were a gift from
Dr. Nancy J. Zeleznik-Le (Loyola University, IL). 293-MLL-AF4
cells were maintained in DMEM plus 10% FBS, 5 μg/mL blasticidin, and 100 μg/mL hygromycin. Jurkat-MLL-AF4 cells were
maintained in RPMI 1640 medium with 10% FBS, 10 μg/mL
blasticidin, and 200 μg/mL hygromycin. Expression of transgenes was induced using 1 or 2 μg/mL doxycycline (16). Parental 293 and Jurkat cells were maintained in the same media as
their sublines without blasticidin and hygromycin.
Plasmids and siRNA
pCXN2 plasmids expressing flag-tagged full-length MLL1
(f-MLL1) or MLL1 with deletion of its SET (catalytic) domain
(f-MLL1-ΔSET) were obtained from Dr. Jay Hess (University
of Michigan, MI). Empty vector was created by digesting
pCXN2-f-MLL1 with XbaI and BglII, followed by blunt-end religation of the resulting plasmid lacking MLL1 cDNA. The MDR1
promoter-luciferase constructs containing the full-length
MDR1 promoter (-1202/+118), the serial deletions, the
CCAAT-box mutant, the GC mutant, and the NF-Y dominant

www.aacrjournals.org

negative construct [NF-Y(DN)] have been previously described
(11, 12, 17). The siGenome SMARTpool MLL1 siRNA and SiControl nontargeting siRNA 1 were purchased from Dharmacon.
Transfection and luciferase assays
Lipofectamine 2000 and oligofectamine (Invitrogen) were
used to transfect plasmid and siRNA oligos, respectively, according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cells were lysed
and processed as recommended using the Luciferase Assay
System (Promega). Luciferase activity was normalized to protein concentration, which was determined using the Bio-Rad
Protein Assay, and to the luciferase activity of pGL2B empty
vector. Experiments were repeated in triplicate a minimum
of three times.
Western blot analysis
Cells were harvested in lysis buffer [50 mmol/L Tris-HCl
(pH 7.4), 100 mmol/L NaCl, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, and
0.5% NP-40] containing complete EDTA-free protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche). Protein lysates were separated by SDSPAGE and blotted with appropriate antibodies: MLLN (clone
N4.4) and MLLC (clone 9-12, Millipore), Pgp (C219, Abcam),
and α-tubulin (clone B-5-1-2, Sigma). Protein bands were
visualized on a Bio-Rad Chemidoc XRS using the ECL
Advance Western Blotting Kit (GE Healthcare).
MLL1 knockdown by short hairpin RNA
Short hairpin RNA (shRNA) against MLL1 (5′-GTGCCAAGCACTGTCGAAA-3′) and control scrambled shRNA (5′GCGCGCTTTGTAGGATTCG-3′) were cloned into the viral
vector pQCXIP gfp super forward, a gift from Dr. Liang Zhou
(Northwestern University, IL), as described previously (18,
19). Phoenix amphotropic cells were transfected with the retroviral constructs using calcium phosphate (20). Viral supernatants from transfected phoenix cells were used to infect
HeLa cells for two days before cells were subjected to puromycin selection at 0.6 μg/mL.
Chromatin immunoprecipitation
Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) was carried out
using the EZ CHIP kit (Millipore) following the manufacturer's instructions. Basically, chromatin cross-linked with 0.5%
formaldehyde was sheared to an average length of 500 bp
by sonicating 10 times with a 10-second pulse followed by
a 60-second recovery period at a setting of 5 in a Fisher Scientific 550 Sonic Dismembrator. Sheared chromatin was immunoprecipitated with anti-H3K4me3, rabbit IgG (Millipore),
or no antibody overnight at 4°C with rotation. Purified
DNA was subjected to PCR using MDR1 promoter-specific
primers P (forward: 5′-ACCTGTTTCGCAGTTTCTCG-3′;
reverse: 5′-CCTCTGCTTCTTTGAGCTTG-3′), MDR1 5′ coding
region-specific primers T (forward: 5′-AACTCTGCCTTCGTGGAGAT-3′; reverse: 5′-ATCCATTCCGACCTGAAGAG-3′),
GAPDH promoter-specific primers (provided in the kit), and
HoxA7 promoter-specific primers (forward: 5′-GAGCCTCCAGGTCTTTTTCC-3′; reverse: 5′-ACACCCCCAGATTTACACCA-3′). PCR products were visualized following 2.0% agarose
gel electrophoresis.

Regulation of MDR1 Expression and Function by MLL1

Results
MLL1 regulates MDR1 transcription
We and others have shown that histones associated with
the MDR1 gene are regulated by epigenetic changes, including
acetylation (11, 12) and methylation (13). Although the histone
acetyltransferase P/CAF has been shown to be responsible
for acetylation of MDR1 proximal promoter histones, the
methyltransferase responsible for creating the methylation
signature at the MDR1 locus is unknown. To investigate this
we surveyed the known human enzymes that have been shown
to trimethylate H3K4, including members of the MLL and
SET1/COMPASS families (15). MLL1, a member of the trithorax group of histone methyltransferases, is required for
normal development due to its role as the major regulator
of Hox gene transcription (21, 22). It is a 3,969-amino-acid
nuclear protein with a complex domain structure; the fulllength protein undergoes site-specific proteolysis to generate

a mature MLL1 protein consisting of a noncovalent heterodimer of two associated subunits: NH2-terminal MLLN (300 kDa)
and COOH-terminal MLLC (180 kDa; refs. 23, 24). Methylation
of H3K4 is mediated through a conserved SET domain within
the COOH terminus (25, 26). Although Hox genes were the first
identified and best studied direct targets of MLL1, this enzyme
has been found associated with a subset of other RNA polymerase II–occupied promoters (27–30).
To query a role for MLL1 in endogenous MDR1 transcription, a mammalian expression construct containing
flag-tagged full-length MLL1 (f-MLL1) or a MLL1 construct
containing a deletion of the SET domain (f-MLL1-ΔSET)
was transiently transfected into HeLa cells. Overexpression
of f-MLL1, shown at the levels of protein (Fig. 1A) and
mRNA (Fig. 1B), led to an ∼5-fold increase in MDR1
mRNA levels relative to cells transfected with empty vector
(Fig. 1B, compare left and right panels), with minimal effect on GAPDH mRNA level. Overexpression f-MLL1-ΔSET

A, MDR1 transcriptional activity was

had no discernible effect on MDR1 gene expression (date
not shown), indicating a requirement for MLL1 catalytic
activity in the regulation of MDR1 expression.
To verify the role of MLL1 in MDR1 transcription, f-MLL1 or
f-MLL1-ΔSET was cotransfected with a luciferase reporter
driven by the MDR1 promoter (pMDR1-1202-Luc; ref. 11). Promoter activity as measured by luciferase expression 24 hours
posttransfection indicated that MLL1 overexpression correlated with an approximately 6.5-fold induction of MDR1 transcription (Fig. 1C); this activation was dependent on the
presence of the SET domain, supporting a requirement for
MLL1 methyltransferase activity. ChIP analysis verified that
this f-MLL1–induced increase in MDR1 mRNA expression
was accompanied by ∼4-fold increase of H3K4me3 at the
proximal promoter region of the MDR1 gene (Fig. 1D), further supporting a role for MLL1 in MDR1 activation. Again,
overexpression of f-MLL1-ΔSET had no effect on the MDR1
promoter-associated H3K4me3 levels (data not shown).
Next, transient knockdown of MLL1 was performed in
HeLa cells and the effects on the MDR1 promoter were determined. Downregulation of MLL1 protein (>95%) with
MLL1 siRNA was accompanied by an approximately 5-fold
decrease in Pgp protein levels (Fig. 2A, left) as compared with

8730

Cancer Res; 70(21) November 1, 2010

nontargeting siRNA-transfected cells. RT-PCR analysis also
revealed an approximately 5-fold decrease in MDR1 mRNA;
GAPDH mRNA levels were unchanged (Fig. 2A, right). siRNAmediated MLL1 knockdown also decreased the expression of
the MDR1 promoter-driven luciferase reporter (>50%) relative
to what was observed following treatment with nontargeting
siRNA (Fig. 2B).
Finally, ChIP assays were performed to evaluate the effect
of MLL1 knockdown on the levels of H3k4me3 associated
with the MDR1 promoter. Retrovirus-mediated transduction
of a MLL1-specific shRNA stably reduced the expression of
MLL1 as compared with the control, scrambled shRNA
(Scr-shRNA; Fig. 2C). As shown in Fig. 2D, knockdown of
MLL1 by shRNA resulted in a 2- to 3-fold decrease of
H3K4me3 levels associated with the MDR1 promoter as well
as the HoxA7 promoter, which has been previously identified
as a MLL1 target gene (31). The GAPDH promoter-associated
H3K4me3 levels were unchanged in both MLL1 and scrambled shRNA–transduced cells (Fig. 2D). Taken together, these
data show that MDR1 transcriptional activation is accompanied by trimethylation of promoter-associated H3K4, and
that this methylation is mediated at least in part by catalytically active MLL1.

Regulation of MDR1 Expression and Function by MLL1

MLL1 regulation of MDR1 transcription involves NF-Y
MDR1 gene expression can be activated by a variety of
stimuli that converge on a region of the MDR1 proximal
promoter that we refer to as the MDR1 “enhancesome”
(32, 33). To determine whether MLL1 regulates MDR1 transcription through the MDR1 enhancesome, a series of MDR1
promoter deletion constructs were transiently cotransfected
with MLL1 into HeLa cells. Analysis of luciferase activity
24 hours posttransfection revealed that deletion of sequences from -1202 to -136 had no significant effect on
MDR1 transcriptional activation by MLL1. However, deletion
of sequences from -136 to -75 nearly abolished activation of
MDR1 by MLL1 (Fig. 3A).
The sequence between -136 and -44 encompasses an inverted CCAAT box and a GC-rich region, both of which have
been shown to be responsible for activation of the MDR1
promoter through interactions with NF-Y and Sp1, respectively (11, 12). To determine whether MLL1 activates MDR1

through either of these elements, f-MLL1 was cotransfected
with an MDR1 promoter construct mutated in either the inverted CCAAT box or the GC box. Luciferase activity determined 24 hours posttransfection revealed that the induction
of MDR1 transcription by MLL1 was dependent on the inverted CCAAT box (Fig. 3B), whereas the GC mutant had a
relatively minor effect on the induction of MDR1 by MLL1.
We and others have shown that the transcription factor
NF-Y binds to the inverted CCAAT box and mediates transcriptional activation of MDR1 (11, 12, 34). To investigate a
role for NF-Y in MLL1 regulation of MDR1 transcription,
NF-Y(DN), a dominant negative NF-Y expression construct
(35), was cotransfected with f-MLL1 and the pMDR1-1202Luc reporter into HeLa cells. Downregulation of NF-Y activity by the dominant negative protein led to a decrease in
MDR1 activation by MLL1, implicating NF-Y in this process
(Fig. 3B). Importantly, MLL1 knockdown did not affect the
expression of either NF-Y or Sp1 (Fig. 2C).

MLL1 regulates Pgp-mediated drug export and
drug resistance
Overexpression of MDR1 has been shown to confer resistance to a vast array of chemotherapeutic agents due to its
ability to increase drug efflux, thereby decreasing intracellular accumulation (4, 5). Our data showing that MLL1 can activate MDR1 expression suggests that MLL1 can modulate
drug transport and, hence, drug resistance. To examine the
functional consequences of MDR1 regulation by MLL1, the
effect of MLL1 knockdown on drug transport and cellular
drug sensitivity was examined. As shown in Fig. 4A, MLL1
knockdown by siRNA, and subsequent MDR1 downregulation, led to a marked increase in retention of DIOC2(3), a
highly specific Pgp substrate (36), as compared with cells
transfected with nontargeting siRNA. The retention of
DIOC2(3) in MLL1 knockdown cells was comparable with
that in mock-transfected cells treated with 22 μmol/L vinblastine, a competitive inhibitor of Pgp-mediated DIOC2(3)
efflux, confirming the specificity of this assay.
The increase in dye retention following knockdown of
MLL1 was also realized at the level of cellular sensitivity to
Pgp substrates. As shown in Fig. 4B, knockdown of MLL1 led
to a 5- to 15-fold increase in cytotoxicity to the Pgp drug sub-

strates paclitaxel, vinblastine, and daunorubicin. Notably,
there was no significant change in sensitivity to the nonPgp substrate methotrexate (IC50 = 16 ± 5.1 μmol/L for cells
transfected with nontargeting siRNA versus IC 50 = 11 ±
3.6 μmol/L for cells transfected with MLL1 specific siRNA,
data not shown). This minimizes the possibility that the
effect of MLL1 on drug sensitivity is due to a more general
effect on cell death pathways. Taken together, these data
confirm that differential expression of MLL1 can affect
MDR1 expression and in turn affect the sensitivity of cells
to Pgp substrates, effectively reversing drug resistance.
MLL1 is not involved in trichostatin A–induced
H3K4me3 of the MDR1 gene
Trichostatin A (TSA), a histone deacetylase inhibitor and
MDR1 transcriptional activator (11, 13), has been shown to
induce H3K4me3 within discrete regions of the MDR1 locus
(13). We repeated these experiments in Hela cells, with interesting results (Fig. 5). TSA induction of MDR1 expression in
HeLa cells (Fig. 5A) was accompanied by increased H3K4me3
level in the coding region only (PCR primers were targeted
493-687 nt downstream of the transcription starting site;
Fig. 5B). Knockdown of MLL1 resulted in a 2-fold decrease

of H3K4me3 level at the MDR1 coding region (Fig. 5C, compare lanes 1 and 4). However, treatment of MLL1 shRNA–
transduced cells with TSA induced similar increases in
H3K4me3 levels at the MDR1 coding region (Fig. 5C), suggesting that MLL1 is not involved in TSA-induced H3K4me3 of
the MDR1 locus.
The MLL-AF4 fusion protein regulates MDR1
transcription
The MLL1 gene is a frequent target for recurrent chromosomal translocations found in human acute leukemias (35,
37). Patients with MLL-rearranged acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) often have a particularly poor prognosis (38).
Remarkably, more than 50 translocation partners have been
identified and MLL-AF4 is one of the most frequent MLL rearrangements, accounting for 34% and 90% of pediatric and
adult MLL-translocation-bearing ALL, respectively (35). To
determine whether MLL fusion proteins could regulate
MDR1 expression during leukemogenesis, the effect of
MLL-AF4 on MDR1 expression was examined in 293 and Jurkat stable cell lines that conditionally express MLL-AF4 following doxycycline induction (16). MLL-AF4 mRNA was
expressed from 2 to 48 hours after doxycycline induction
as determined by RT-PCR, and peaked by 12 hours (data
not shown); therefore, 12 hours of doxycycline exposure
was used in subsequent studies. As shown in Fig. 6A,
MDR1 mRNA levels were increased up to 3-fold following
doxycycline treatment of 293-MLL-AF4 cells. Exposure of parental 293 cells to doxycycline did not affect MDR1 expression, supporting a role for MLL-AF4 in this event. Similar
results were seen in Jurkat-MLL-AF4 cells and their parental
counterparts (Fig. 6B). These data suggest a possible role for
MLL fusion proteins in the regulation of MDR1 transcription
during leukemogenesis.

upon MDR1 gene activation (11, 12, 34). Here we show that
NF-Y is also involved in the transcriptional regulation of
MDR1 by MLL1, although how this is accomplished is not
yet clear. In one scenario MLL1 may be recruited to the
MDR1 enhancesome by NF-Y, which has been shown to be
involved in the positioning of chromatin histone methyl
marks, and required for MLL complex recruitment and
H3K4 methylation on other CCAAT element–containing
promoters (40). Although we have not yet been able to show
a direct interaction between NF-Y and MLL1, we recognize
the technical difficulties with these studies and additional
experiments will be required to rule this out. Alternatively,
MLL1 could be recruited to the MDR1 promoter by other factors and subsequent H3K4 methylation may provide a mark
for recruitment of multiple transcriptional activators that
recognize and bind to this histone modification to facilitate
gene transcription (2, 15). Either scenario could explain our
data showing a requirement for NF-Y in MLL1-mediated
MDR1 activation; the interplay between these critical factors
is currently under investigation. Moreover, it should be noted
that >95% knockdown of MLL1 only partially decreased MDR1
H3K4me3 as detected by ChIP analysis. Therefore, the possibility remains that, although MLL1 is clearly involved in
MDR1 transcriptional regulation, other histone methylases
may also be required to achieve the full complement of
methylated residues.

Discussion
We have shown that histone methylation regulates MDR1
expression, and that the histone methyltransferase MLL1 is
involved in this regulation. Induction of MDR1 transcriptional activity by wild-type MLL1 is dependent on the SET domain, showing a requirement for the methyltransferase
activity of MLL1 for this effect. This is consistent with what
has already been shown for other MLL1 targets, such as Hox
genes (25, 26) that require H3K4 methylation for recruitment
of the basal transcription machinery and transcriptional initiation. It has been suggested that this requirement could be
more important for a subset of genes, including those lacking
TATA or other canonical core promoter elements (29, 39).
Interestingly, all of the human drug-related transporters examined to date, including MDR1, lack an appropriately positioned TATA box (32, 33), suggesting that recruitment of the
basal machinery to these genes could be enhanced by prior
methylation of H3K4 by MLL1.
The CCAAT box that we had previously identified as part
of the MDR1 enhancesome is required for MLL1 regulation
of MDR1 transcription (11, 12). We and others have shown
that the transcription factor NF-Y interacts with this element

Indeed, we have also shown that TSA induces H3K4me3
levels of the MDR1 gene through its coding region. This is
consistent with other reports showing that histone deacetylase inhibitors can induce specific increases in H3K4 methylation in many cell types (41, 42). What is interesting is our
observation that MLL1 is not required for TSA-induced
methylation of the coding region, suggesting a role for another methyltransferase in creating this methyl mark. MLL4,
a member of the MLL methyltransferase family, has been
identified as the major enzyme responsible for the addition
of H3K4me3 with histone deacetylase inhibitor treatment
(42). Whether MLL4, or another methyltransferase, is involved in TSA-induced H3K4me3 of the MDR1 locus in under investigation.
A particularly relevant finding in this study was that the
transcriptional regulation of MDR1 by MLL1 has functional
consequences. Knockdown of MLL1 leads to increased retention of a Pgp-specific dye as well as increased cellular sensitivity to the Pgp substrates paclitaxel, vinblastine, and
daunorubicin. This has greater significance considering that
many leukemias have a high prevalence of MLL dysregulation. In some cases, this is achieved through gene amplification (43), but in the majority of cases, MLL1 is found as part
of a chromosomal translocation (35, 37). An initially perplexing observation was that the MLL found in translocations
lacked the catalytic SET domain, yet was still capable of activating MLL1 target genes with no effect on H3K4 methylation (25). The current thinking is that at least a subset of
MLL fusion partners, including AF4, can recruit DOT1L, a
histone H3K79 methyltransferase, to activate target genes
and provoke leukemogenesis with enhanced H3K79me2 (35,
44–47). In this study, we showed that MDR1 expression is upregulated by MLL-AF4 with almost the same efficiency as
wild-type MLL1. Although the mechanism by which this oc-

curs is still under investigation, this is the first evidence that
MLL fusions may contribute to the regulation of drug resistance during leukemogenesis. Although there are some contradictory data, the expression and activity of MDR1 have
been identified as predictors of the treatment outcome in
childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia in many clinical
studies (48–50). To date, there have been no efforts to correlate MDR1 expression with the expression of MLL1 or MLL
fusion proteins. Our data suggest that the analysis of the impact of MLL1 fusion proteins on expression of MDR1 and
other drug transporters is warranted.
In conclusion, this is the first report of a histone methyltransferase involved in the regulation of an ABC drug transporter, and the first indication that translocations involved in
leukemogenesis may also impact drug resistance in this tumor type. Thus, MLL1 provides a novel target for epigenetic
therapy of cancer to circumvent multidrug resistance.
