ABSTRACT
The inhibitor of PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway, such as Rad001, has not shown
therapeutic efficacy as a single agent in prostate cancer. Arsenic trioxide induces
the autophagic pathway in prostate cancer cells. We identified Arsenic trioxide can
synergize with Rad001 to induce cytotoxicity of prostate cancer cells. Moreover,
we identified synergistic induction of autophagy and apoptosis as the underlying
mechanism. This enhanced autophagic cell death is accompanied by increased Beclin1
mRNA stability as well as upregulation of ATG5-ATG12 conjugate, Beclin1, and LC3-2.
Rad001 and ATO also can synergistically inhibit tumors in prostate cancer xenograft
animal model. These results identify and validate a novel mechanism to enhance and
expand the existing targeted therapeutic agent to treat prostate cancer.

INTRODUCTION

signaling pathways [10]. The Arsenic trioxide (ATO,
Figure 1B) has been administered by the FDA to treat the
acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) [11, 12]. Certain
studies showed a lot of solid tumors proliferation may
be suppressed with ATO treatment [13, 14]. However,
its severe side effects, hepatic toxicity, cardiac toxicity,
granulocytopenia, etc, may confine it therapeutic effect in
clinical practice.
In order to probe into the molecular mechanisms
of cell death, more and more studies have focused on the
autophagy and apoptosis. The autophagy is characteristic
of abundant autphagic vacuoles in the cytoplasm [15, 16].
The inhibition of PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway may induce
the autophagic cell death [16]. In the present study, we
probed into how the combination of Rad001 and ATO
synergistically induced the prostate cancer cells death and
inhibit the prostate cancer xenograft tumor proliferation.
We found that the combination treatment may induce both
autophagy and apoptosis in prostatic LNCaP and PC3 cell
lines. The LNCaP cells expressed the prostatic specific
antigen (PSA) and androgen receptor (AR), with features
characteristic of prostatic adenocarcinoma [17]. On the

Prostate cancer (PCa) is the most common cause
of cancer-related death in the United States [1–3]. The
early stages PCa may be cured by certain therapeutic
strategies such as radical surgery or radiation, but the
therapeutic effect for advanced and metastatic PCa is poor
[4, 5]. It has been reported that most PCa may evolve
into the castration resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) if the
patients with PCa underwent the castration [6, 7], whose
mechanisms may be attributable to the resistance to
Androgen Receptor (AR), increased expression of AR, AR
mutations/phosphorylation/splice variants [6]. Therefore,
it is necessary to develop and explore the effective and
novel therapies. It has been reported that the PI3KAKT-mTOR pathway is vital of importance for the PCa
progression [8, 9].
The Rad001 (Figure 1A) is one of the mTOR, the
PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway, specific inhibitors, which
may exert a negative effect on the PCa progression.
However, its therapeutic effect in the PCa is poor,
which may be attributable to activation of other bypass

other hand, the PC3 cells are negative for AR and PSA but
are positive for neuroendocrine markers, similar to human
prostate small cell carcinoma, representative of the most
late stage or aggressive prostate cancer [18]. The LNCaP
and PC3 prostate cancer cell lines appear to have different
sensitivities to the combinatorial treatment, which may
have clinical implications in the future studies. More
importantly, the combination of ATO and Rad001 can also
synergistically suppress xenograft model tumors growth.
Our studies suggest a seminal potential therapeutic
strategy for advanced and recurrence PCa in the future.

when the cells were administered with ATO or Rad001
alone. The ATO ED50 of LNCaP cell lines was 22.38 μM,
and the ED50 for Rad001 was 0.75 μM. For PC3 cells, the
ED50 for ATO and Rad001 were 24.45 μM and 0.70 μM,
respectively. However, for both PC3 and LNCaP prostate
cancer cell lines, the combination of ATO and Rad001
treatment resulted in more reduction of cell luminescent
units (Z-axis), compared with either ATO or Rad001 alone
treatment (Figure 3B). There was the significant synergism
of the combination of ATO and Rad001, according to the
combination index (CI) determined with the CalcuSyn
program (Figure 3C). When the LNCaP cells were treated
with 0.37 μM Rad001, the cell luminescence units reduced
to 13.62%; and 11.19 μM ATO treatment alone induced
32.23% reduction in cell luminescence units. However, the
reduction of cell luminescence units increased to 68.29%
(CI = 0.76) when treatment with two compounds. On the
other hand, when the PC3 cells were treated with 0.18 μM
Rad001, the cell luminescence units reduced to 15.67%;
and 6 μM ATO treatment alone induced 18.67% reduction
in cell luminescence units. However, the reduction of cell
luminescence units increased to 78.12% (CI = 0.57) when
treatment with two compounds.
According to Mixture–Algebraic analysis, the
combinations of two compounds with the wide range
of combinatorial concentrations have the synergism,
suggesting a large number of combination groups had the
synergistic reduction of cell luminescence units. According
to results of CalcuSyn software, we chose different drug
concentration for LNCaP and PC3 cell lines. The LNCaP
cell lines were treated with DMSO, 0.37 μM Rad001,
11.19 μM ATO and combinatorial ATO and Rad001 for
24 hrs. The PC3 cell lines were treated with DMSO, 0.35
μM Rad001, 12.00 μM ATO and combinatorial ATO and
Rad001 for 24 hrs. We performed luminescence units of
the cells after the drug treatment, there was a significant
decrease luminescence units in combinatorial group
compared with alone compound group in both LNCaP and

cleaved form of PARP was more up-regulated (Figure 4B),
compared with alone treatment. What’s more, the cleaved
form of Caspase-3 and caspase-3/7 activity were both
induced with the combination treatment (Figure 4B),
suggesting combination treatment activating the apoptotic
pathway. In order to quantification percent of apoptotic
cells, the flow cytometric assay was performed. The

of multiple or double membrane layers structure. The
Figure 5B showed the number of vacuoles cells were

Figure 3: The combination of Rad001 and ATO induced a synergistic reduction of cell number in prostate cancer cells.

The ATO can synergize with Rad001 to inhibit cell luminescence units in prostate cancer LNCaP and PC3 cells. For LNCaP cells, they
were treated DMSO (control), Rad001 (0.37 μM), ATO (11.19 μM), and their combination, for 24 hrs. For PC3 cells, they were treated
DMSO (control), Rad001 (0.35 μM), ATO (12.00 μM), and their combination, for 24 hrs. The cell survival was detected with Celltiter Glo
measurement (A). (B) A gradient dose of Rad001, ATO alone and the combination was used to detect cell survival as in Figure 3B (X-axis:
Rad001 µM, Y-axis: ATO µM, Z-axis: 1-luminescence-units%). (C) Normalised isobologram analysis showed synergistic interactions in
prostate cancer LNCaP and PC3 cell lines. Normalised isobologram assays were achieved with CalcuSyn software, which can perform the
drug does-effect calculation with the median effect method described by Chou TC (34). A large number of combination groups were below
the line, indicative of synergism, in the prostate cancer cells.

Taking together, the autophagy is synergistically induced
by the combination of ATO and Rad001 treatment in
prostate cancer PC3 and LNCaP cell lines, which may

increase, the half-life of Beclin1 mRNA was examined.
As shown in Figure 5B, the Beclin1 mRNA stability was
synergistically increased with the combination treatment
as compared to one compound treatment, suggesting
increased stability of Beclin1 mRNA may result in the
increase of Beclin1 mRNA.
What's more, we performed small interference RNA
to reduce the expression of Beclin1, and detected whether
its loss may exert impacts on cell death with combination

treatment. As shown in Figure 5C, the reduction of
Beclin1 protein led to a significant rescue of cell death
with the combinatorial compounds treatment. The percent
of cell death significantly decreased with the reduction
of Beclin1 protein (Figure 5C). These results suggest
the increase of cell death may result from the synergistic
induction of autophagy with the combination of ATO and
Rad001 treatment, and Beclin1 is induced with the two
compounds treatment.

they were treated DMSO (control), Rad001 (0.37 μM), ATO (11.19 μM), and their combination, for 24 hrs. For PC3 cells, they were treated

rescue the castration treatment [23]. Therefore, the
autophagy may be vital of importance in the progression
of PCa, and targeting its pathway may provide a novel
therapeutic approach for the treatment of PCa.
Goussetis DJ et al. showed ATO can induce
autophagy in the leukemia cells. Such induction of
autophagy seems to require activation of the ERK pathway
but AKT- mTOR pathway is unnecessary for activation of
autophagy [24]. Chiu HW et al. reported the ATO induced
apoptotic and autophagic cell death in human glioma cells
[12]. However its therapeutic index is severely weakened
by its significant clinical side effects. Our studies showed
that it may synergize with Rad001, which may provides
the novel therapeutic strategy. This synergistic therapeutic
approach may not only reduce the side effects but increase
the therapeutic effects. It also has been reported that
the combination of irradiation and ATO enhances the
cytotoxicity in the fibrosarcoma cancer cells via induction
of both apoptosis and autophagy [11]. However, it needs a

DISCUSSION
Endocrine therapy is one of the most common
therapeutic strategy for metastatic and advanced PCa for
many years. However, endocrine therapy, including the
novel drugs such as enzalutamide, acetate abiraterone, etc,
is palliative. A large number of patients will evolve into
hormone independent or CRPC stage eventually [19, 20].
The AR amplification, mutation, splice variants, etc, are
the most common mechanism of CRPC [6]. It has been
reported that the AKT-mTOR pathway exerts an important
role in a wide range of human cancers including PCa [21].
Xu Y et al. study showed the mTOR activity may be
enhanced with androgen and autophagy also is inhibited
by activation of mTOR pathway [22]. Farrow JM et al.
demonstrated that PCa cells can induce autophagy to

high concentration of the drug, which can cause significant
clinical side effects, severely limiting the therapeutic effect
of the ATO. Levine B et al. has showed that the autophagy
may be induced with combination of ATO and Rad001
treatment [16]. Therefore, we detected if the combination
of ATO and Rad001 synergistically induced the PCa cells
death via activating the autophagy pathway.
Our studies demonstrated combination of
Rad001and ATO induced PCa cells death through
synergistically activation both autophagy and apoptosis.
Apoptosis (programmed cell death) is considered as
to be an important approach of tumor suppression.
The autophagy get rid of aged or damaged materials
to maintain cellular homeostasis. The stress such as
chemotherapeutic compounds, nutrient starvation,
hormone treatment, etc , and pathological circumstances,
for example neurodegenerative disease, infectious disease,
cancer, etc, can induce the autophagy [25]. Although it has
been still unclear how the autophagy connect the apoptosis
to kill the cells. The apoptosis can be induced by the Atg5
protein, a cleaved form of the essential autophagy. On the
other hand, the autophagy may also be regulated with the
Bcl-XL and Bcl-2, antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family members.
The large number of studies have showed the apoptosis
and autophagy could be activated simultaneously in cancer
cells [26–31]. It has been reported that combination of
the GX15-070 and histone deacetylase inhibitor induced
the cell death through activation of both apoptosis and
autophagy [32]. Although the induction of autophagy by
Rad001 is not potent [33], we have demonstrated ATO
can synergize with Rad001 to induce autophagic and
apoptotic cell death in two prostate cancer cell lines. The
mechanism of the induction of autophagy by combination
of ATO and Rad001 is the result of increased stability of
Beclin1 mRNA. The combinational treatment strategy
may obviously inhibit the tumorigenesis in prostate
cancer LNCaP and PC3 cells, and the PC3 cells may
represent the most aggressive form of late stage PCa and
form of the CRPC [18]. Our studies may provide a novel
therapeutic strategy for recurrence, advanced PCa, CRPC,
which failed the both traditional (e.g., LHRH agonist, AR
blocker) and latest (e.g., acetate abirateron, enzalutamide)
forms of hormonal therapy.
In summary, we have identified that combination
of two compounds induces the synergistic cell death
in prostate cancer, thus potentially providing a novel
therapeutic possibility for advanced and recurrence
prostate cancer.

for 30 min on ice. The cells were centrifuged for 15min
at 4°C. The protein concentration in the supernatant
was determined with the Bradford assay (Bio-Rad).
Equal amount of protein was loaded on 8%, 15% SDS-­
polyacrylamide gels and transferred to polyvinylidene
fluoride (PVDF) membrane. The membrane was blocked
with nonfat dry milk for 30 min, incubated with primary
antibody in nonfat dry milk overnight, washed with PBS
for 30 min, incubated with secondary antibody for 1 hrs,
washed with PBS/0.1%Tween20 for 1 hrs and detected
with enhanced chemiluminescence (Pierce).

Caspase-3/7 activity analysis
Equal number of the LNCaP and PC3 cells was
seeded into the 96 wells plates. After 24 hrs LNCaP cells
were treated with DMSO (control), Rad001 (0.37 μM), ATO
(11.19 μM), or a combination of Rad001 (0.37 μM) and
ATO (11.19 μM), respectively, for 24 hrs. PC3 cell lines
were treated with DMSO (control), Rad001 (0.35 μM), ATO
(12.00 μM), or a combination of Rad001 (0.35 μM) and
ATO (12.00 μM), respectively, for 24 hrs. The caspase-3/7
activity was measured by the SensoLyte Homogeneous
AMC Caspase-3/7 Assay kit after reaction for 1 hrs. All the
experiments were carried out in the triplicates.

GFP-LC3 analysis
The cells were transfected with GFP-LC3 plasmid
using LipofectamineTM 2000 transfection reagent. After
24 hrs, the medium was changed, and the LNCaP cells
were treated with DMSO (control), Rad001 (0.37 μM),
ATO (11.19 μM), or a combination of Rad001 (0.37 μM)
and ATO (11.19 μM), respectively, for 24 hrs. The PC3
cell lines were treated with DMSO (control), Rad001
(0.35 μM), ATO (12.00 μM), or a combination of Rad001
(0.35 μM) and ATO (12.00 μM), respectively, for 24 hrs.
The cells were then fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for
30 min. The cells were washed twice with PBS and stained
with DAPI, and observed under a fluorescence microscope
(Eclipse 90i slide scope) with ×40 lens.

Analysis of apoptosis
After the cells were treated the DMSO, Rad001,
ATO or a combination of Rad001 and ATO for 24 hrs,
the LNCaP and PC3 cells were collected. The apoptosis
was quantified by FACS analysis (BD FACSDiva™
Software v6) with Annexin-V/7-AAD staining following
the manufacture’s guidelines. The percentage of Annexin
V positive cells was analyzed by FlowJo (Version 7.6.4).

Transmission electron microscopy
Prostate cancer LNCaP and PC3 cells were seeded
in 10 cm dishes and allowed to attach overnight. The cells
were treated with DMSO, Rad001, ATO and combination
of Rad001 and ATO for 24 hrs. Cells were fixed in icecold 2.5% electron microscopy grade glutaraldehyde (in
0.1 mol/l PBS (pH 7.3)), rinsed with PBS, postfixed in
1% osmium tetroxide with 0.1% potassium ferricyanide,
dehydrated through a graded series of ethanol (30–90%),

Quantitative real-time PCR was performed using SA
Biosciences RT2 Real-timeTM SYBR Kit with the following
parameters: 15 μl, 95°C for 8min for one cycle followed
by 43 cycles of 95°C for 15”/60°C for 60”.

the multiple compound dose-effect calculations were
performed. Combination index (CI) values of < 0.9, > 0.9
and < 1.2, > 1.2 was considered as synergistic, additive,
antagonistic effect, respectively. Statistical analysis was
performed by two-sided t test. P value less than 0.05 was
considered as the statistically significant. The statistical
significance of the tumor volumes of differences between
treatment and control groups mice were determined
by One-way ANOVA followed by the Dunnett’s test.
Statistical analyses on body weight were performed by
One-way ANOVA followed by Tukey’s test. The level of
significance was set at P < 0.05. Statistical calculations
were performed with the SPSS version 13.0.

Small interfering RNA transfection
3 × 103 of cells were seeded into the 96 wells plates
and transfected with siRNA (100 nM) by the Dharmafect
general transfection reagent. The combination of Rad001
and ATO was added to the cells for 24 hrs after transfection
followed by cell viability measurement. To determine the
knockdown efficiency of the siRNA, LNCaP and PC3
cells were seeded into the 12-wells plate followed by
transfection with Beclin1-siRNA and Control-siRNA,
respectively, and collected after another 24 hrs.

Six-week-old SCID (severe combined immuno
deficiency) mice were obtained from the Anhui Medical
University Division of Laboratory Animal Medicine. All
the mice were inoculated with 100 µl (50% Matrigel/PBS)
LNCaP cells suspension (6 × 106) to either dorsal flank with
25-gauge syringe. When the tumor size reached between 50
and 100 mm3, the mice were randomly divided into control,
Rad001, ATO and combination group, with 6 mice per
group. The Rad001 and ATO was delivered intraperitonealy
1 mg/kg/day and 2 mg/kg/day, respectively. The tumor sizes
were measured every 4 day with a caliper. These tumor
measurements were converted to tumor volume using the
formula (V = 0.52 × L × W2), where W and L are the smaller
and larger diameters. Animal body weight was also weighed
the same day when the tumors were measured. At the 44th
day, mice from four groups were all sacrificed; tumors were
dissected and collected. All the animal experiments were
conducted according to the protocol approved by the Anhui
Medical University Animal Research Committee (ARC).
