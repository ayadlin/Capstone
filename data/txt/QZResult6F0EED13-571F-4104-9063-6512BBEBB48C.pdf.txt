BACKGROUND: Erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESA) administered to cancer patients with anemia reduce the
need for blood transfusions and improve quality-of-life (QOL). Concerns about toxicity have led to more restrictive
recommendations for ESA use; however, the incremental costs and benefits of such a strategy are unknown.
METHODS: The authors created a decision model to examine the costs and consequences of ESA use in patients
with anemia and cancer from the perspective of the Canadian public healthcare system. Model inputs were informed
by a recent systematic review. Extensive sensitivity analyses and scenario analysis rigorously assessed QOL benefits
and more conservative ESA administration practices (initial hemoglobin [Hb] <10 g/dL, target Hb 12 g/dL, and
chemotherapy induced anemia only). RESULTS: Compared with supportive transfusions only, conventional ESA treatment was associated with an incremental cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained of $267,000 during a 15week time frame. During a 1.3-year time horizon, ESA was associated with higher costs and worse clinical outcomes.
In scenarios where multiple assumptions regarding QOL all favored ESA, the lowest incremental cost per QALY
gained was $126,000. Analyses simulating the use of ESA in accordance with recently issued guidelines resulted in
incremental cost per QALY gained of >$100,000 or ESA being dominated (greater costs with lower benefit) in the
majority of the scenarios, although greater variability in the cost-utility ratio was present. CONCLUSIONS: Use of ESA
for anemia related to cancer is associated with incremental cost-effectiveness ratios that are not economically attracC 2010

Anemia is common in patients with cancer and is associated with negative clinical outcomes. Treatment with erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESA) effectively increases hemoglobin and reduces the need for blood transfusions, improves
short-term disease-specific quality of life (QOL),1 and is preferred over transfusions by patients,2,3 but is costly. In addition, recent evidence indicates that traditional administration of ESA in patients with anemia related to cancer (ARC) is
associated with increased risk of mortality and adverse events.4-6
The conclusions of previous economic evaluations of ESA for the treatment of ARC have varied, although many
have concluded that it is generally not cost-effective.1,7,8 However, all previous analyses have evaluated use of this agent as
commonly used before recent guidelines from the American Society of Clinical Oncology/American Society of Hematology (ASCO/ASH), which recommend initiation of ESA when hemoglobin is <10 g/dL, a target hemoglobin of 12 g/
dL, and use in chemotherapy-induced anemia only.9 Guideline adherence is likely to result in lower cumulative ESA dose,
the major driver of costs. Furthermore, although increased risk of thromboembolic events and death have been reported
with traditional ESA use in this population,4-6 the risk of these events is less clear with more conservative ESA use. As such
uncertainty exists concerning the balance of costs, adverse events, and clinical benefit of ESA in this patient population.
Many patients and clinicians seek to use ESA because of its convenience, effectiveness in reducing transfusions, and

improvements in QOL. We sought to determine the costeffectiveness of ESA when used in a conventional fashion
and in accordance with ASCO/ASH guidelines.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Base case — conventional ESA use
A decision analytic model was constructed incorporating
healthcare resource utilization and health outcomes in
adult patients with ARC in adherence to published guidelines.10,11 Treatment strategies evaluated included treatment with conventional use of ESA compared with no
ESA, with supportive blood transfusion as required in either strategy. The population was based on characteristics
of subjects in randomized controlled trials of ESA for the
treatment of ARC identified in our systematic review,4
and summary measures from this review informed all
model inputs where data was available. The base-case
analysis considered subjects from all included studies, and
subsequent analyses focused on subjects enrolled in studies that met components of the ASCO/ASH guidelines.
The perspective was that of the Canadian publicly funded
healthcare system.
A short-term decision model was created incorporating events that may influence incremental costs and qual-

ity-adjusted life years (QALY) in this patient population
during the typical duration of treatment with ESA (Fig.
1). Long-term outcomes occurring during an additional
1-year time frame were evaluated in a secondary analysis
that considered mortality only (as no other differences in
long-term outcomes was found in the clinical review).
The risk of mortality during the short-term, probability of
blood transfusion, and starting and ending hemoglobin
values were based on weighted summary characteristics of
the control arms of studies included in the systematic
review (Table 1). Long-term annual mortality was estimated from 16 studies that assessed mortality beyond the
short-term treatment period (average follow-up duration
90 weeks).12-26 The weekly starting dose and duration of
treatment was based on the intervention arm of included
studies to define traditional ESA use. The cumulative
dose of ESA was inconsistently reported, but as the mean
weekly dose did not appear to differ from the weekly starting dose when both were reported,13,16,17,26-31 the weekly
dose was assumed to be constant over the duration of
administration.
The relative risk of mortality for all ESA during the
ESA treatment period was determined from the clinical
systematic review; 6 studies reported mortality in patients
who survived the short-term treatment period during an

additional 63 weeks,12-17 from which the relative risk of
mortality during the subsequent year was calculated (Table 1). The difference in the number of units (U) that
were transfused per subject between treatment arms was
determined from a meta-analysis of studies in the clinical
review. As the relative risk of transfusions was more commonly reported, this was incorporated in a secondary
analysis using expert opinion to estimate the total number
of units transfused for those who needed a transfusion.
The impact of thrombotic events was considered by
determining the baseline risk of thrombotic events in the
control arms of included studies, applying the relative risk
from the systematic review, and incorporating annual
costs of thromboembolic from literature sources.32 As the
true costs and consequences of thrombotic events in a cancer patient population are not well described, these were
included in sensitivity analysis only (favoring ESA in the
base case). The long-term infectious complications of
erythrocyte transfusion were not incorporated as previous
work suggests that the risk of blood-borne illness does not

3226

have a meaningful impact,1,33,34 and the risks are estimated to be very small given the current safety of the
Canadian blood supply.35-37
ESA use in ARC results in improvements in diseasespecific quality-of-life (QOL) measures (Functional
Assessment of Cancer Therapy, Linear Analogue SelfAssessment) compared with no ESA,1,4 although no
randomized clinical trials (RCTs) have used a preferencebased measure of QOL required for cost-utility analyses.
As such, we used the relation between achieved hemoglobin and utility score reported by Ossa2 that uses time
trade-off analysis to elicit utilities for anemia-related
health states in patients with cancer (Table 2). Various
health states were described based on a typical cancer
patient undergoing chemotherapy without anemia (hemoglobin >11.0g/L) as the reference health state, and
additional health states were described for various degrees
of anemia. All health-state descriptions were based on the
Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Anemia subscale and clinical literature, and health-state descriptions

were validated by 3 specialists in oncology and 6 cancer
patients who experienced anemia. Laypersons (n ¼ 110)
from the United Kingdom underwent face-to-face interviews where health states were described in detail, and
time trade-off methodology was used to derive utilities for
each of the anemia states. As the health status related to
cancer and its treatment was constant in all scenarios, we
assumed that incremental differences between the health
states were due to treatment of anemia only. This
approach values the health state of anemia related to cancer only, and it does not incorporate preferences as to how
anemia is treated.
This association between hemoglobin and QOL was
transformed into a linear relation to capture the potential
difference in QOL that would occur with small differences in hemoglobin (Fig. 2). Alternative associations of
hemoglobin values and QOL using untransformed data2
and utility estimates from ESA-manufacturer studies1
were considered in secondary analyses.
Initial hemoglobin was calculated from the control
and intervention arms in the included studies, and the
final achieved hemoglobin was calculated using the incremental change in hemoglobin achieved using ESA from
the systematic review (1.50 g/dL; 95% CI, 1.27-1.72; Table 1). Hemoglobin (g/dL) in the ESA arm tends to gradually increase after administration until the end of the
study period and may persist after this.1 As a result, the
incremental differences in hemoglobin at the end of ESA
use are likely near their greatest. For simplicity, and
because we did not have access to primary data to calculate
the area under the curve, we assumed that incremental
differences in hemoglobin and associated QOL would
occur immediately after the initiation of ESA and persist
throughout the treatment period (15 weeks). This
approach to estimating the utility scores is favorable to the
ESA strategy. We also tested the impact of the duration of

hemoglobin (and QOL) benefits persisting for 26 weeks
(15 weeks of treatment with 11 weeks after treatment1).
The cost of ESA was based on the cost of a 30,000 U
syringe of epoetin alpha from Alberta Blue Cross,38 and
the cost of 1 unit of erythrocytes for transfusion was taken
from literature sources.3,33,37 All costs were converted to
2008 Canadian dollars by using the consumer price index
for healthcare goods in Canada.39 No discounting was
performed given the short time horizon.
A 1-way sensitivity analysis was performed on model
parameters by using the 95% confidence interval, standard deviation, or interquartile range as appropriate. The
costs of ESA varied by 25%, and a range of estimates of
costs per unit of blood transfusion was considered (Table
1). An alternative approach to modeling reduction in
blood transfusion (applying a relative risk to the baseline
rate of transfusion) was also performed. In some circumstances, timely blood transfusion for outpatients may be
difficult to provide. This may result in an emergency
room visit or admission to hospital. Although this issue is
best addressed through assessment and modification of
healthcare service capacity, we assessed a scenario in which
all those who received a blood transfusion would be
admitted for 1 day (with per diem costs of $934 to $1330
based on local data, and utility of 0 [equivalent to death]
during hospitalization) in the model incorporating relative risk of transfusion. Finally, whereas mortality and
cost differences due to clinically significant transfusion
reactions are incorporated in the base case,37,40 we
assessed the impact of change in QOL, assuming an average of 3 days hospitalization (based on expert opinion) for
management with utility score of 0.

ESA use in accordance with ASCO/ASH
guidelines
The recently published ASCO/ASH guidelines recommend that ESA be used in patients with chemotherapyinduced anemia, started only when Hb is <10 g/dL and
the dose adjusted to achieve hemoglobin of 12 g/dL or
less.9 To estimate the cost-utility of this strategy, we
performed scenario analyses by identifying study populations approximating these elements. Subgroups were considered by using data from studies with 1) target Hb of
12 g/dL; 2) baseline Hb of <10 g/dL; and 3) target Hb
of 12 g/dL, starting Hb of <10 g/dL, and chemotherapy-induced anemia only. We determined the relative risk
(RR) of mortality and transfusion, initial hemoglobin,
and the starting and actual ESA weekly dose from these

studies (Table 3). Input from the base model were used
when data were not available from the included studies.

RESULTS
In the base case, we modeled a cohort of patients similar
to those identified in a recent systematic review.4 The average age of the cohort was 62 years, their mean initial hemoglobin was 10.4 g/dL, and 80% were treated with
chemotherapy. The type of cancer among patients in this
cohort was 21% hematological, 63% solid, and 17%
mixed malignancy. Compared with no ESA and supportive transfusion, treatment with epoetin resulted in incremental costs of $8643 and incremental benefits of 0.03
QALYs over 15 weeks, resulting in an incremental cost
per QALY gained of $267,000. During a 17-month time
frame, the ESA strategy was dominated with incremental
costs of $8643 and lower QALYs (0.086) compared
with the no ESA strategy.
The base-case results were robust in sensitivity analysis (Tables 4 and 5). By using the extremes of 95% confidence intervals for short-term and long-term mortality,
both favoring ESA, resulted in an incremental cost per
QALY gained of $101,000. A best-case quality-of-life scenario in which all assumptions favored the ESA arm over
the short-term led to an incremental cost effectiveness of
$125,000/QALY (Table 6). Making the assumption that
there is no increased risk of mortality or adverse events
with ESA did not significantly alter the results of the
QOL scenarios. Incremental cost per QALY gained
remained >$180,000 under the assumption that transfusion required 1 day of hospitalization, disutility for transfusion reaction, weekly dose and dose duration of epoetin,
and cost per unit of ESA (Table 5). Varying the cumulative dose and cost per unit of ESA had a larger quantitative
impact on results. Use of the most up-to-date Canadian
estimates of the cost of transfusing 1 unit of erythrocytes
(including collection, production, distribution, adminis-

3228

tration, and transfusion reactions)37 resulted in an incremental cost per QALY gained of $271,000/QALY.
To estimate the cost effectiveness of ESA use concordant with ASH/ASCO guidelines,9 model inputs from studies that met components of these guidelines were
summarized where available (Table 3). The initial and actual
dose of ESA was substantially lower than the base-case analysis, although infrequently reported. The results were quantitatively lower than the base case, but all exceeded $70,000/
QALY, and ESA was dominated (more costly with less benefit) in 3 of 10 models. It should be noted that because of the
poor quality of studies, inconsistent reporting, and wide
confidence intervals of the model inputs, there is considerable uncertainty in these estimates.

DISCUSSION
Recent evidence clearly demonstrates that increased risk of
mortality and adverse events are associated with conventional ESA use in patients with anemia related to cancer.4-6
A currently unanswered question facing clinicians and policy makers is whether the benefits in quality of life, on balance, outweigh risks and costs where the risk of adverse
consequences of ESA are attenuated or eliminated, which is
possible under more conservative ESA administration practices. Several Canadian provinces currently fund ESA for
the treatment of ARC when used according to the ASCO/
ASH guidelines, despite the lack of evidence to support this
practice.4 Our results suggest that treatment with ESA
remains economically unattractive even when used according to the ASCO/ASH guidelines41,42 —similar to the conclusions reached by previous economic evaluations
evaluating more liberal use of ESA.1,7,8
To our knowledge, no RCTs used a preferencebased measure of overall quality of life, which is required
to perform cost-utility analyses. This is especially important when considering strategies to treat anemia, as the
major benefit is in QOL. Disease-specific measures,
which are commonly used in clinical studies of cancer

not eligible for inclusion in the systematic review, the
magnitude of this improvement also met the MCID
threshold.45 Therefore, it appears reasonable to assume
that ESA may improve quality of life among cancer
patients, at least in the short term.
We used assumptions that may exaggerate the QOL
gains associated with differences in hemoglobin, favoring
the ESA strategy. In the base-case method of estimating
QOL, the difference in the utility score between the ESA
and the no ESA arm in surviving patients was 0.15. This
large difference in utility is far greater than the minimal
clinically important difference of 0.03 for the EQ-5D46
and is similar to the change in QOL that is associated with
a patient with end-stage kidney disease on dialysis who
receives a kidney transplant.47 Despite this possible overestimation of QOL in the ESA arm, the incremental costutility ratio (ICUR) remained >$100,000/QALY, even
in multiway sensitivity analysis.
We did not incorporate patient preferences with
respect to avoiding blood transfusion (travel, time requirement, intravenous administration, aversion to receipt of

3230

blood products) and avoiding the potential cyclic nature of
this treatment (gradually dropping hemoglobin followed by
a rapid rise with blood transfusion). However, 2 published
studies used willingness-to-pay (WTP) and discrete-choice
experiment (DCE) methods to estimate the value that participants place on these considerations. Ortega3 reported the
willingness-to-pay for ESA therapy (compared with no ESA
therapy) of $587 and $613 (1997 US dollars), respectively,
from patients who were receiving cisplatin or noncisplatin
therapy. By using DCE methods, Ossa2 elicited WTP from
laypersons in the United Kingdom of £368 (2004 British
pounds). These results indicated the preference of patients
and laypersons for ESA over transfusion only, although these
studies did not inform respondents of the increased risk of
adverse outcomes that have recently come to light. Regardless, incorporation of the monetary value of these preferences
would not result in meaningful changes in the conclusions,
suggesting that in private-payor systems, this treatment strategy would be unattractive.
We performed additional scenario analyses to simulate the use of ESA in accordance with the ASCO/ASH

criteria.9 However, very few studies met even individual
components of these guidelines, and the selective reporting
of outcomes might have introduced bias. In light of these
inherent uncertainties, we performed 10 analyses simulating the use of ESA in accordance with components of
ASCO/ASH criteria. In 3 of these analyses, ESA therapy
was dominated (more costly with less benefit than the no
ESA strategy); in 4 the incremental cost per QALY gained
was >$100,000/QALY; and none were <$70,000/QALY.
These analyses included scenarios where the mortality risk
was similar or lower than the no ESA strategy (and the cost
of thrombotic events were not considered). Overall, these
findings suggest that even with more conservative administration and dosing, ESA therapy for patients with cancer is
unlikely to be economically attractive when using a commonly accepted threshold of economic attractiveness.41,42
As in most economic evaluations, our models and
results are limited by the availability and quality of existing evidence. Our evaluation has been strengthened by its
rigorous methods and our state-of-the-art systematic
review. The lack of strong evidence on the incremental
changes in utility-based QOL was addressed by modeling
approaches and sensitivity analyses as described above.
The model did not incorporate other considerations that
may affect QOL, including cyclical hemoglobin values,
aversion to intravenous administration, and receipt of
human-blood products, but this was informally assessed
by using willingness-to-pay estimates from other sources.
This is the first economic evaluation to determine the
ICUR of ESA use in accordance with recently published
ASCO/ASH guidelines. Although considerable uncertainty
concerning the precise incremental costs and benefits of
ESA therapy in this subgroup remains, there is no evidence
to suggest that ESA is more economically attractive in this
subgroup than in any other. Finally, this economic evaluation considered subjects that were candidates for blood
transfusion. Specific subpopulations, such as those in
whom blood transfusions are difficult or unacceptable (ie,
iron overload, Jehovah’s Witnesses) and patients with poor
access to transfusion support, were not examined.
In summary, ESA use in patients with ARC does not
appear to be economically attractive, even when used in
the more conservative fashion recommended by current
guidelines. Available evidence suggests that using ESA to
treat ARC does not represent a good value for the money.
