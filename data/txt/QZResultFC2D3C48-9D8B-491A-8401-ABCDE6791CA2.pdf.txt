BACKGROUND: Patients with relapsed chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) often achieve response with chemoimmunotherapy but
have short remission durations. Studies have shown that patients with CLL have increased angiogenesis in the microenvironment; levels of proangiogenic growth factors such as VEGF and/or angiopoietin-2 are also elevated. Increased angiogenesis correlates with
poor outcome in CLL. Bevacizumab (B) is a humanized monoclonal antibody targeting VEGF-A. METHODS: In this study, we analyzed
whether a combination of bevacizumab with fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, and rituximab chemoimmunotherapy (FCR-B) could
improve outcomes in patients with relapsed CLL. Sixty-two patients were enrolled. The median age of the patients was 60 years
(range, 31-84 years) and 40% had received >1 prior therapy for CLL. Sixty-one patients were evaluable for toxicity, and 57 were evaluable for response. Six cycles were planned; 36 patients (59%) completed 4-6 cycles of the regimen. RESULTS: The overall response
rate was 79%, with 13 (23%) complete remissions (CRs), 8 nodular partial remissions (14%), and 24 partial remissions (43%). The median progression-free survival and overall survival rates were 13.5 and 45 months, respectively. Grade 3 or 4 toxicities included febrile
neutropenia (n 5 40), infections (n 5 21), thrombocytopenia (n 5 18) and anemia (n 5 9). CONCLUSIONS: Results with FCR-B were simC 2014 American

INTRODUCTION
Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is a clonal B-cell malignancy with a heterogeneous disease course. Chemoimmunotherapy is frequently used as frontline therapy in patients requiring treatment and produces high response rates and durable remissions. However, in relapsed patients subsequent response to chemotherapy-based regimens is less, and response
duration is significantly shorter.1,2 Advances in the understanding of CLL’s microenvironment, cell signaling, and molecular biology have helped in identifying novel therapeutic targets.3,4 Angiogenesis is one of the main mechanisms promoting the growth and metastasis of cancer cells.5,6 Studies have demonstrated evidence of active angiogenesis, elevated
angiogenic factors such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and angiopoietin-2 (Ang-2),7 overexpression of
VEGF receptors, and increased bone marrow microvessel density in CLL.8-13 Interaction of microvascular endothelial
cells with CLL cells promotes the proliferation of CLL cells in the lymph nodes and the bone marrow,14 enhances their
survival by NF-kappaB activation, and protects CLL cells from fludarabine-induced apoptosis.15,16 Furthermore, an
increased degree of angiogenesis, as documented by high bone marrow microvessel density and elevated levels of angiogenic factors in the blood, is associated with advanced clinical stage, shorter time to first treatment and shorter
progression-free survival (PFS) in patients with CLL.17,18 CLL cells express VEGF receptors and can also produce VEGF
under the influence of microenvironmental factors; in turn, CLL cells can promote endothelial cell proliferation.19-21 In
experiments in which CLL cells were cultured with exogenous VEGF, VEGF was shown to promote the levels of antiapoptotic proteins such as MCL-1.22
Bevacizumab is a recombinant humanized monoclonal antibody targeting VEGF. Clinical trials in patients with
metastatic solid tumors have shown that the addition of bevacizumab to chemotherapy can prolong the PFS.23-31 In a
randomized clinical trial, 402 patients with metastatic colorectal cancer were treated with irinotecan, 5-fluorouracil, and
leucovorin in combination with bevacizumab. The addition of bevacizumab to chemotherapy significantly improved the

progression-free survival, overall survival, and duration of
remission.24 Similar results were seen when bevacizumab
was combined with chemotherapy in patients with non–
small cell lung cancer, cervical cancer, ovarian cancer, and
metastatic breast cancer.25,28,31,32
Robak et al33 reported on the use of fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, and rituximab (FCR) as a treatment for
relapsed CLL in a randomized study that compared FCR
with FC. Eighty-two percent of these patients had been
previously treated with an alkylating agent, and only 17%
had received fludarabine. The FCR regimen demonstrated an overall response rate (ORR) of 70%, a complete
remission (CR) rate of 24%, and a median PFS of 30.6
months, with a median follow-up time of 25 months. We
earlier reported on the efficacy of FCR in relapsed patients
with CLL.34 Seventy percent of patients had received
prior fludarabine-based therapy, including 4 patients who
had been treated with FCR previously. The ORR was
74%, the CR rate was 30%, and the median PFS was 21
months, with a median follow-up time of 43 months.
Given the correlation with increased angiogenesis
and disease progression in CLL, we tested whether the
addition of bevacizumab to FCR could improve PFS in
patients with relapsed CLL.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
This study was approved by the institutional review board
of the MD Anderson Cancer Center (MDACC) and registered on www.clinicaltrials.gov with a trial identifier
number: NCT00448019. All patients provided informed
consent as per institutional guidelines and in accordance
with the Declaration of Helsinki. A total of 62 patients
were enrolled in this open-label, phase 2 trial from May
2007 through February 2010. All the patients had progressive CLL with an indication for treatment as per NCIWG criteria. Patients had relapsed, fludarabine-sensitive
(duration of response >6 months), or fludarabine-naive
CLL. Refractoriness to an alkylating agent was defined as
failure to achieve at least a partial remission (PR) with the
last alkylating agent–based treatment or progression
within 6 months of treatment. Patients were required to
have an adequate performance status (WHO/Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status 2) and
adequate organ function (serum creatinine 2 mg/dL,
total bilirubin 2 mg/dL, AST [SGOT] and ALT
[SGPT] 2 times the upper limit of normal). Prognostic
markers including CD38 status, presence or absence of
Zap-70, immunoglobulin heavy-chain variable gene
(IGHV) mutation status, standard metaphase cytogenetic
analysis, and fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH)

were performed on bone marrow at baseline in the majority of patients.
FCR Comparison Group

Patients enrolled at MDACC in a previously published
clinical trial of FCR as a therapy for relapsed CLL were
used as a historical comparison group (n 5 205).34 The
median follow-up time for the FCR cohort was 120
months (95% CI, 116-128 months).
Treatment Plan

FCR consisted of fludarabine (F) 25 mg/m2 IV and cyclophosphamide (C) 250 mg/m2 intravenously (IV) on days 24 for course 1 and days 1-3 for courses 2-6. Rituximab (R)
was administered on day 1 at 375 mg/m2 for course 1 and
500 mg/m2 for courses 2-6. Bevacizumab (B) 10 mg/kg IV
was given on day 3 of course 1 and day 2 of courses 2-6.
The basis for choosing bevacizumab 10 mg/kg every 4 weeks
was based on 10 mg/kg being the most commonly used
dose as well as 4 weeks being the established schedule of
FCR administration. Courses were repeated every 4 weeks
or longer depending on the recovery of neutrophil and platelet counts. Dose reductions for FC, but not R or bevacizumab, occurred if the patients experienced prolonged grade 3
or 4 hematologic toxicity or infections. Prophylaxis against
tumor lysis syndrome, herpes virus reactivation, Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia, and the use of myeloid growth factors were at the discretion of the treating physician.
Response Assessment

Patients were evaluated for response according to the
1996 NCI-WG response criteria at least 2 months after
their last course.35 Computed tomography scans were not
routinely performed for response assessment. Adverse
events and serious adverse events were documented
according to the Common Toxicity Criteria Version 2.0
(National Cancer Institute).
Statistical Considerations

The primary objective was to determine PFS and duration
of response to FCR-B in previously treated patients with
CLL. Secondary objectives were to assess the response
rates, CR rate, ORR, and safety of FCR-B. PFS was
defined as the time from the start of treatment to progression, which included treatment failure, relapse, or death.
Overall survival (OS) was defined as the time from the
start of treatment to the last follow-up date or death. The
distribution of continuous variables was summarized by
mean, standard deviation, and range. The distribution of
each categorical variable was summarized in terms of its
frequencies and percentages. Continuous variables were
3495

Original Article

compared between treatment groups by the Wilcoxon
rank sum test, and categorical variables were compared
between treatment groups by the Fisher exact test. The
Kaplan-Meier curve was used to estimate OS and PFS.
Log rank tests were used to compare time-to-event variables between groups. The Cox proportional hazard model
was used to evaluate the ability of the covariates to predict
PFS or OS. All computations were carried out in SAS version 9.1 and S-Plus version 8. Kaplan-Meier curves were
prepared by Graph Pad Prism version 6.0.

RESULTS
Patient Characteristics

Sixty-two patients with relapsed CLL were enrolled in this
trial. There were 49 men (79%) and 13 women (21%). The
median age was 60 years (range, 31-84 years). The median
number of prior regimens was 2 (range, 1-5). Five patients
(8%) were previously treated with FCR. Of the total of 62
patients, 11 (18%) were fludarabine and alkylating agent refractory, 1 (2%) was fludarabine refractory, and 3 (5%)
were alkylating agent refractory. Rai stage 3-4 disease was
present in 58% of patients. Unmutated IGHV was observed
in 83% of patients. Deletion 17p or deletion 11q FISH abnormality was detected in 16% and 44% of patients, respectively. Among the 62 patients, 28 patients (45%) have died,
with a median follow-up time of 40 months (95% CI, 3345 months). A total of 5 patients were not evaluable in the
FCR-B cohort, 1 patient went to hospice after 1 cycle
because of metastatic squamous cell cancer, 1 patient went
home after 1 cycle and did not return by choice, 1 patient
declined further treatment because of grade 3-4 nausea and
vomiting during first course, and 2 patients died, 1 due to
cardiac arrest and the other of an unknown cause. Two
patients who died early in the course of FCR-B had preexisting cardiac comorbidities. The patient who died of cardiac
arrest had a history of coronary artery disease, atrial fibrillation, and antianginal medications. The patient whose cause
of death was unknown was a heavy smoker and had a history
of coronary artery bypass surgery.
Table 1 shows the characteristics of the patients enrolled in the FCR-B trial compared with the patients
treated with FCR. A significantly higher proportions of
patients in the FCR-B trial exhibited an unmutated
IGHV gene, Zap-70 positivity, and del17p or del1q by
FISH analysis compared with those patients in the FCR
cohort (P < .05). The median number of cycles completed by patients in the FCR-B and the FCR trials was 4
and 5, respectively. Among the patients in the FCR-B
group, 27 (44%) completed all 6 cycles. In the FCR group

refractory and 2 (4%) were alkylating agent refractory.
Responses were evaluated at least 2 months after completion
of therapy to allow for recovery of peripheral blood counts.
Table 2 shows the overall response rate by pretreatment characteristics. The response rates with FCR-B included CR in
23% (13 of 57), nodular partial response (nPR) in 13% (8
of 14), and PR in 43% (24 of 43), for an ORR of 79% (45
of 57). Five patients who were not evaluable (8%) came off
the study early in the course of treatment. Two patients died
after cycle 2: 1 patient died of cardiac arrest, and 1 patient
died of an unknown cause. Three patients came off study after the first course: 1 went to hospice because of metastatic
squamous cell cancer, 1 patient withdrew consent after a significant infusion reaction to rituximab and grades 3-4 nausea
and vomiting during the first cycle, and 1 patient went home
and came off study by choice.
Patients with deletion17p by FISH also had a lower
ORR, as did the patients without del17p — 7% (4 of 57)
versus 72% (41 of 57), respectively (P 5 .03).
Response rates with FCR-B were similar to those
observed with FCR in relapsed patients with CLL: a CR
rate of 23% versus 30% and an ORR of 79% versus 78%,
respectively.

side effects were myelosuppression, infection, and nausea

(n 5 14), anemia (n 5 9), and nausea and vomiting
(n 5 5). Grade 3-4 toxicities observed in FCR-B were
similar to those seen in the historical cohort of patients
treated with FCR. In the historical cohort treated with
FCR, grade 3-4 pneumonia and sepsis were the most
common serious infections (n 5 46; 16%), and in
patients with FCR-B, grade 3-4 pneumonia and sepsis
were observed in 11 patients (18%). Potential
bevacizumab-associated toxicities36 included hypertension in 1 patient, gastrointestinal hemorrhage (without
perforation) in 2 patients, and rash in 2 patients. All these
toxicities were grade 1-2.
Progression-Free Survival

Progression-free survival (PFS) was analyzed among
patients receiving FCR-B and compared with that of the
historical cohort of patients who were treated with FCR.
Kaplan-Meier estimates of PFS according to treatments
(FCR-B vs FCR) are shown in Figure 1. The median PFS
was 13.5 months with FCR-B versus 21 months with the
FCR regimen (P 5 .05). Of note is that the FCR-B trial
included a higher proportion of patients with poor prognostic characteristics, including complex karyotype,
del17p or del11q, and unmutated IGHV compared with
those in the FCR trial (Table 1). These characteristics are
known to shorten the PFS seen with FCR. The median
PFS by response (CR, nPR, and PR) in FCR-B was 42,
22, and 12 months, respectively, whereas in the historical
cohort the corresponding values were 49, 29, and 15
months, respectively. Multivariate analysis showing factors correlating with PFS are shown in Table 4. Factors in
the multivariate model predicting for shorter PFS with
FCR or FCR-B included 3 cycles of therapy, alkylating
agent and fludarabine refractoriness, and deletion 11q or

pretreatment characteristics, treatment was not significant
in the multivariate analysis.
The impact of cytogenetics by FISH on PFS in
patients who received FCR-B was analyzed (Fig. 2). The
median PFS (in months) in patients with del17p, normal
FISH, del11q, and del13q were 3, 10, 17, and 22 months,
respectively (log rank P 5 .037). There were 3 patients
with trisomy 12, and only 1 has relapsed.
Overall Survival

Overall survival (OS) was analyzed among the patients
receiving FCR-B and compared with that of patients treated
with FCR. Kaplan-Meier estimates of OS according to treatment (FCR-B vs FCR) are shown in Figure 3. The median
OS was 45 months with the FCR-B regimen versus 49
months with the FCR regimen (P 5 .48). The median OS

FCR-B was not reached, not reached, and 34.3 months,
respectively, whereas in the historical cohort the corresponding values were 129, 100, and 42 months, respectively. Multivariate analysis showing factors predicting for overall
survival is summarized in Table 5. Pretreatment characteristics significantly associated with shorter OS included >2
prior therapies, 3 cycles of treatment, alkylating agent and
fludarabine refractoriness, del17p by FISH, and complex
karyotype. Of note, treatment with FCR-B or FCR was not
predictive of OS in the final Cox regression model (Table 5).
The impact of FISH categories on OS in patients
who received FCR-B was analyzed (Fig. 4). Patients with
del17p had inferior survival. The median OS (in months)
in patients in the del17p, normal FISH, del11q, trisomy
12, and del13q categories was 7.3, 33, not reached, 34.3,
and not reached, respectively (log rank P 5 .0015).

with CLL who are treated with chemotherapy can
occur because of clonal evolution of CLL cells,29 persistence of drug-resistant clones, presence of minimal
residual disease, and prosurvival signals to CLL cells
from the microenvironment. Antiangiogenic strategies
have involved treatment with a monoclonal antibody
against VEGF such as bevacizumab or aflibercept or
treatment with tyrosine kinase inhibitors such as sorafenib, sunitinib, or pazopanib in the treatment of various solid tumors. Various randomized clinical trials
have demonstrated that the combination of bevacizumab with chemotherapy in metastatic solid tumors can
improve progression-free and overall survival.30 The
relevance of angiogenesis in CLL progression generated
the rationale of adding bevacizumab to chemotherapy.
The primary objective of this trial was to assess the
outcome after the addition of bevacizumab to FCR in
relapsed patients with CLL. The results using FCR-B
were compared with the results of our previous trial of
FCR in relapsed CLL. The addition of the bevacizumab to FCR did not improve the PFS or OS. The
FCR-B regimen was similar to FCR in terms of
response rates (ORR and CR, 79% vs 78% and 23%
vs 30%, respectively). The FCR-B trial had a higher
proportion of patients with adverse prognostic features
such as unmutated IGVH, complex karyotype, del11q,
and del17p. The majority of the patients in the historical cohort did not have FISH data available and only
had karyotype analysis performed by conventional
cytogenetics. In the multivariate analysis the type of
therapy was not significant in predicting PFS or OS.

situ hybridization (FISH) cytogenetic categories (del17p,
del11q, negative FISH, trisomy 12, and del13q) in patients
receiving FCR-B (P 5.0015).

Similar to the FCR regimen, the FCR-B regimen did
not improve PFS or OS in patients with del17p.
Bevacizumab has been associated with cardiac and
vascular toxicities. These toxicities were observed in 10%35% of patients who received bevacizumab in combination with chemotherapy to treat various solid tumors. In
this study potential bevacizumab-associated toxicities
were mild — hypertension in 1 patient, gastrointestinal
hemorrhage (without perforation) in 2 patients, and rash
in 2 patients. This reduced toxicity in the current trial
may be explained by the less frequent dosing of bevacizumab — once every 2 weeks in other studies versus once every 4 weeks in the current trial.
Bevacizumab was also evaluated in other hematologic malignancies. In a randomized phase 2 trial in elderly patients with acute myelogenous leukemia, the
addition of bevacizumab to chemotherapy (317) did not
result in improved clinical benefit.37 In non-Hodgkin’s
lymphoma, the addition of bevacizumab to cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone
(CHOP) chemotherapy alone or to rituximab-CHOP did
not result in any benefit.38,39 In the only prior trial conducted with CLL patients, 12 patients with relapsed disease were treated with single-agent bevacizumab, and
none responded.40
A possible explanation for the lack of efficacy of bevacizumab in hematological malignancies compared with
solid tumors could be less dependence of hematological
malignancies on VEGF signaling and rapid adaptation of
malignant cells to VEGF inhibition.34 Other reasons for
the lack of improved PFS with FCR and bevacizumab
included that the status of angiogenesis (serum VEGF,
Ang-2 levels, amount of bone marrow, microvascular density, etc.) was not evaluated in patients before therapy. It is

possible that the addition of bevacizumab might be selectively useful for patients with increased levels of angiogenesis in the microenvironment.
In summary, adding bevacizumab to FCR in
patients with relapsed CLL did not improve outcomes,
and results were similar to those seen previously with
FCR.
