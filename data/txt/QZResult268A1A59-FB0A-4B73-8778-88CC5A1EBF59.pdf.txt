Activation of Toll-like Receptor 5 on Breast Cancer Cells by
Flagellin Suppresses Cell Proliferation and Tumor Growth
Zhenyu Cai, Amir Sanchez, Zhongcheng Shi, Tingting Zhang, Mingyao Liu, and Dekai Zhang

Abstract
Increasing evidence showed that Toll-like receptors (TLR), key receptors in innate immunity, play a role in
cancer progression and development but activation of different TLRs might exhibit the exact opposite outcome,
antitumor or protumor effects. TLR function has been extensively studied in innate immune cells, so we
investigated the role of TLR signaling in breast cancer epithelial cells. We found that TLR5 was highly expressed
in breast carcinomas and that TLR5 signaling pathway is overly responsive in breast cancer cells. Interestingly,
flagellin/TLR5 signaling in breast cancer cells inhibits cell proliferation and an anchorage-independent growth, a
hallmark of tumorigenic transformation. In addition, the secretion of soluble factors induced by flagellin
contributed to the growth-inhibitory activity in an autocrine fashion. The inhibitory activity was further
confirmed in mouse xenografts of human breast cancer cells. These findings indicate that TLR5 activation by
flagellin mediates innate immune response to elicit potent antitumor activity in breast cancer cells themselves,
which may serve as a novel therapeutic target for human breast cancer therapy. Cancer Res; 71(7); 2466–75.

(16, 17). Thus, the function and biological importance of TLRs
expressed on various tumor cells seem complex.
Unlike other TLR family members, TLR5 is not expressed on
mouse macrophages and conventional dendritic cells (DC).
Instead, TLR5 expression is high in intestinal epithelial cells
and lamina propria DCs (18, 19). It has been shown that TLR5
is highly expressed on gastric carcinoma cells (20, 21). Recent
evidence has shown that activation of TLR5 by its ligand
flagellin elicits potent antitumor activity and thus inhibits
colon tumor growth in vivo (21). In contrast, Sfondrini and
colleagues showed that early administration of flagellin at the
time of implanting mouse mammary cells resulted in
increased tumor growth (22). Thus, the different results of
these studies reveal the unique responses and susceptibilities
to flagellin stimulation in different cancer cells. To date, the
specific function and detailed mechanism of TLR5 signaling
pathways in breast cancer cells are still poorly understood.
Here, we report a comprehensive characterization of TLR5
expression and TLR5 signaling in human breast cancer cells
themselves. We found that TLR5 was highly expressed in
human breast carcinomas and TLR5 signaling was overly
functional in human breast cancer cells. Remarkably, triggering of TLR5 signaling pathway by flagellin in breast cancer
cells inhibits cell proliferation and elicits the potential antitumor activity in mouse xenografts of human breast cancer.

Materials and Methods

Toll-like receptors (TLR) are membrane-bound receptors
that play key roles in both the innate and adaptive immune
systems, particularly in inflammatory responses against
pathogen infection (1–3). These receptors are primarily
expressed on innate immune cells and recognize conserved
pathogen-associated molecular patterns (4–7). TLRs can also
recognize some endogenous ligands (8, 9). Activation of TLRs
might play a role in cancer progression and development (10,
11); however, activation of different TLRs might display completely different results. Several studies have shown that
activation of TLR4 signaling by LPS protects tumor cells from
immune attack and thus promotes tumor growth (12–14).
Triggering of TLR9 on cancer cells has been shown to protect
cancer cells against TRAIL (TNF-related apoptosis-inducing
ligand)-induced apoptosis and promote tumor cell proliferation (15). In contrast, activation of TLR3 induced an antiproliferative signaling in human breast cancer and melanoma

Antitumor Activity of TLR5 Signaling in Breast Cancer Cells

phospho-c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase [phospho-JNK (c-jun NH,
kinase)], phosphoTyr701-STAT1, phosphoTyr705-STAT3, STAT1,
STAT3, cyclin B1, cyclin D1, cyclin E2, and p21Waf1/Cip1 were
purchased from Cell Signaling Technology. Antibodies against
phospho-extracellular signal regulated kinase (ERK)-1/2,
ERK1, proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA; F-2), p27Kip1
(F-8), CDK2 (D-12), and TLR5 (H-127) were purchased from
Santa Cruz Biotechnology. An antibody to Gr-1 was purchased
from BD Pharmingen. An antibody to F4/80 was purchased
from AbD Serotec. Anti-human TLR5 (anti-hTLR5) immunoglobulin (Ig) A, which is a blocking monoclonal antibody
(mAb) to human TLR5, and matched human IgA isotype
control were purchased from InvivoGen. The plasmid construct expressing NF-kB luciferase reporter was described
previously (23). Human breast cancer tissue arrays (BRC711
and T082) including 75 individual breast cancer specimens
were purchased from US Biomax. Total RNA was isolated from
TRIzol Reagent (Invitrogen), and cDNA was prepared as
previously described (24).
Generation of TLR5 knocked down MCF-7 cells
The silencing vector–expressing siRNA targeting the human
TLR5 was obtained from InvivoGen (21).
Western blotting and luciferase assay
Tumor cells were starved with 1% FBS medium for 2 hours
to decrease the signaling background and then treated with
flagellin or other ligands for the indicated periods of time at
37 C. Immunoblotting with the appropriate antibodies was
performed as described previously (12). The luciferase assay
was conducted as described previously (24).
Immunofluorescence staining and
immunohistochemistry
Cells grown on a glass slide were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100. Slides were
washed with PBS and blocked with normal goat serum (1%)
plus 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) in PBS for 20 minutes at
room temperature. Slides were then incubated overnight with
primary antibodies (1:100) against TLR5 in 1 PBS with 1%
BSA. Samples were washed with PBS and incubated with
biotin anti-rabbit secondary antibody (1:200) for 1 hour. Next,
samples were washed with PBS and incubated with streptavidin–horseradish peroxidase conjugate solution for 20 minutes. After washing with PBS, the specifically bound antibodies
were detected using TSA Plus Fluorescence Systems from
Perkin Elmer. The slides were then rinsed and mounted with
DAPI (40 ,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole) mounting solution.
Images were analyzed with a Zeiss Axioskop-2 microscope.
Immunohistochemical analyses were performed with the ABC
Elite Kit.
Cytokine microarray analysis
RayBio Human Cytokine Antibody Array V was purchased
from Ray Biotech. MCF-7 cells were treated with flagellin (0.1
mg/mL) or PBS (control) for 24 hours. Then, supernatants were
collected and equal amounts of the supernatants were subjected to a human cytokine array, as previously described (21,

www.aacrjournals.org

25, 26). The cytokine expression was determined by measuring
the density of each spot, using TotalLab TL100 software.
Cell-cycle analysis
Fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) was performed
for cell-cycle analysis. Flagellin-treated or nontreated cells in
different days were detached with trypsin and stained with
FITC BrdU Flow Kit (BD Pharmingen). Flow cytometry was
performed by using a FACSCalibur system, and data were
analyzed with FlowJo software (Tree Star).
Soft agar colony formation
Breast cancer cells (5  103) were plated in 0.35% low
melting point agarose/growth medium onto 6-well plates with
a 0.6% agarose underlay. About 1.5 mL growth medium with or
without flagellin at indifferent concentrations was added on
the top of agarose, and the medium was changed every 3 to
4 days and incubated at 37 C in a humidified incubator for 14
days. At the end of the treatment, the cells were washed with
PBS and incubated in a solution of 0.005% crystal violet and
10% formalin for 10 minutes and then rinsed with water. The
integrated density of the colonies on each plate was determined using TotalLab TL100 software.
Xenograft model of human breast cancer
To establish breast cancer xenografts in nude mice, MDAMB-468 cells (5  106) were mixed with Matrigel and injected
under aseptic conditions into the mammary fat pads of nude
mice (n ¼ 6 for each group). For MCF-7 xenografts, ovariectomized mice were first implanted subcutaneously with 60-day
estradiol-releasing pellets (1.7 mg per pellet from Innovative
Research) before 24 hours of cell injection. Then, MCF-7 cells (2
 107) were mixed with Matrigel and injected into both fourth
mammary fat pads of ovariectomized athymic nude mice. For
peritumoral flagellin treatment, 10 days after injecting cells
into the mammary fat pads of nude mice, we administered
flagellin solution (1.0 mg in 50 mL) around the tumor site (1
injection/every 2 days for 3–4 weeks). For intravenous flagellin
administration, 1 month later, MDA-MB-468 xenografts were
fully established and each mouse was injected with flagellin
solution (2 mg in 100 mL) through the tail vein (1 injection/every
7 days for 6 weeks). The control group was injected with saline
solution by the same method. The tumor was monitored and
evaluated every 2 and 7 days for peritumoral and intravenous
flagellin administration, respectively. Tumors were measured
in 2 dimensions, and volume was calculated according to the
formula: V ¼ 0.5(length  width2).

Results
Expression of TLR5 in breast cancer
Although TLRs are mainly expressed and activated on
innate immune cells such as macrophages and DCs, TLRs
may be functional in other cell types. To investigate the
expression and potential function of TLR5 in breast cancer
epithelial cells, we performed immunohistochemical staining
on tissue arrays containing normal breast tissues and breast
carcinomas (n ¼ 75) with different subtypes, stages, and

localized only in the cytoplasm in MDA-MB-231 and MDAMB-435 cells (Fig. 1C). The expression of MyD88, which is a
critical adaptor protein in TLR5 signaling pathway, was also
detected in these breast cancer cell lines by Western blotting

grades. We found that TLR5 was expressed in normal breast
duct epithelium but not in the fibrofatty tissue of normal
breast samples (Fig. 1A). Of all the breast cancer tissues tested,
60 tumor samples (80%) were positive for TLR5 and the
majority of TLR5-positive cases were high-grade ductal carcinomas (Fig. 1A and Supplementary Table S1). Specifically,
TLR5 was highly expressed in most of invasive ductal carcinomas (IDC) and moderately expressed in medullary carcinomas and invasive lobular carcinoma (Fig. 1A). The staining
was localized in the cytoplasm and on the cell surface, which
was similar to the localization of TLR4 in ovarian cancer cells
(14). However, no staining of TLR5 was observed in breast
mucinous adenocarcinomas (Supplementary Table S1).
We then analyzed the expression of TLR5 in breast cancer
cell lines including MCF-7, MDA-MB-468, SKBR3, T47D, MDAMB-231, and MDA-MB-435 cells. Immunofluorescence confirmed the expression of TLR5 in these 6 cell lines (Fig. 1B).
Similarly to our observation on the tissue sections, TLR5 was
distributed both inside the cell and on the cell surface in MCF7, MDA-MB-468, SKBR3, and T47D cells. However, TLR5 was

Activation of TLR5 signaling pathway by flagellin in

We next asked whether TLR5 was also functional to
activate TLR signaling pathway in breast cancer cells. To
address this question, the 6 breast cancer cell lines were
transfected with a construct containing a luciferase reporter
under the control of NF-kB response element and stimulated
with the TLR5 natural ligand flagellin in different concentrations. As shown in Figure 2A, the NF-kB luciferase reporter activities in MCF-7, MDA-MB-468, SKBR3, and T47D
cells were increased in a dose-dependent manner after
challenging with flagellin. However, the other 2 cell lines,
MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-435, seemed to be unresponsive
to flagellin stimulation.

Antitumor Activity of TLR5 Signaling in Breast Cancer Cells

Figure 2. Flagellin activates TLR5dependent signaling pathway in
breast cancer cells. A, breast
cancer cells were transfected with
NF-kB reporter plasmid and
analyzed for luciferase activity
induced by indicated flagellin
doses. B, MCF-7 cells were
transfected with NF-kB reporter
plasmid and analyzed for
luciferase activity induced by
indicated flagellin doses in the
presence of anti-hTLR5 mAb or
human IgA control. C, MCF-7 and
knocked down (TLR5-shRNA)
cells were treated with flagellin
(0.1 mg/mL) by indicated time
points, and phosphorylation of
IkB, ERK, and JNK were analyzed
by immunoblotting with
phosphorylation-specific and
control antibodies. D, MCF-7 cells
were induced by flagellin (0.1 mg/
mL) for 6 hours for the expression
of cytokine mRNAs analyzed by
RT-PCR. E, equal amounts of
supernatant from control cells and
flagellin-stimulated MCF-7 cells
were used for human cytokine
microarray analysis (top).
Cytokines with significant
increase were measured by spot
intensity and presented as a ratio
to mock control (bottom). All data
are representative results of 3
independent experiments.

To verify that the activation of NF-kB following flagellin
incubation was due to TLR5 activation, we first preincubated
MCF-7 cells with an anti-TLR5 blocking antibody in different
concentrations and then challenged the cells with flagellin. We
found that the flagellin-induced NF-kB luciferase reporter
activity can be suppressed by anti-TLR5 blocking antibody
in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2B). Then, we further
established an MCF-7 tumor cell line stably expressing
TLR5 short hairpin RNA (shRNA; Supplementary Fig. S2).
The phosphorylation levels of IkB, ERK, and JNK after flagellin
stimulation were increased in MCF-7 wild-type cells but not in
the knocked down cells (Fig. 2C). We next asked whether
flagellin/TLR5 signaling pathway in MCF-7 cells can activate
the expression of cytokines and/or chemokines in canonical
TLR downstream signaling. Interestingly, we found that upon

www.aacrjournals.org

flagellin stimulation, there was a striking induction of TNF-a,
interleukin (IL)-1b, IL-6, and IL-8 mRNA in MCF-7 cells but
not in TLR5 knocked down cells (Fig. 2D). Thus, these data
collectively suggested that flagellin activated TLR5-dependent
signaling pathway in breast cancer cells. To further analyze
the profile of cytokines and chemokines induced by flagellin in
breast cancer cells, the flagellin-stimulated tumor cell supernatant was used for cytokine microarray. Flagellin substantially increased the production of several chemokines
including epithelial cell–derived neutrophil–activating peptide-78 (ENA-78), macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)3a, monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1), macrophagederived chemokine (MDC), IL-6, Gro-a, and osteoprotegerin
(Fig. 2E). Interestingly, the induced chemokines upon flagellin
stimulation are mostly involved in leukocyte recruitment (27).

Thus, activation of TLR5 by flagellin initiated TLR signaling
pathway transduction and induced the secretion of several
cytokines and chemokines in breast cancer cells.
Flagellin inhibits tumor cell proliferation and colony
formation in vitro
To investigate the role of flagellin/TLR5 signaling on tumor
cell proliferation, a BrdUrd (bromodeoxyuridine) incorporation assay was performed. MCF-7 cells were treated with
flagellin (0.1 mg/mL) for periods up to 3 days and the number
of BrdUrd-incorporated cells was determined daily by flow
cytometry. As shown in Figure 3A, the percentage of BrdUrdincorporated cells was decreased from 46% to 32% after 1 day
of flagellin treatment, suggesting that flagellin inhibited cell
proliferation. Moreover, after 2 and 3 days of treatment, the
percentage of BrdUrd-positive cells was further decreased and
maintained up to 13% of the cells. However, we could not
detect the population of cells in sub-G0/G1 phase (data not
shown), indicating that flagellin did not induce apoptosis.
To further characterize the effect of flagellin on tumor cell
proliferation, a colony formation assay was performed in
MCF-7 cells after challenging with flagellin with increased
concentrations. This experiment was designed to assay the
ability of cells to grow unattached to a surface and therefore
suspended in agar. Thus, it could be used to measure the
tumorigenicity of tumor cells. As shown in Figure 3B, the
colony formation ability of MCF-7 was significantly decreased
by flagellin in a dose-dependent manner. This phenomenon

2470

Cancer Res; 71(7) April 1, 2011

was TLR5 dependent because knocking down TLR5 in the cells
could block the suppressive activity of flagellin (Fig. 3C).
Flagellin also inhibited colony formation of MDA-MB-468,
SKBR3, and T47D cells in higher concentration (10 mg/mL;
Fig. 3D). However, for the other 2 flagellin nonresponsive cells
MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-435, no significant decrease of
colony number was observed even in the presence of flagellin
with the highest concentration. Thus, the activation of TLR5
by flagellin inhibited proliferation and colony formation of
breast cancer cells in vitro.
Soluble factors mediate the antiproliferation effect of
flagellin
To gain more insights into the molecular mechanism in the
antiproliferation effect of flagellin on breast cancer cells, we
analyzed the expression level of various proteins involved in
cell-cycle regulation upon flagellin treatment. We found that
the levels of cyclin B1, cyclin D1, and cyclin E2 were significantly decreased after flagellin treatment. A marginal increase
of the CDK inhibitor p27 was also observed at early stage of
flagellin treatment (Fig. 4A). To analyze whether treatment of
MCF-7 cells with flagellin results in the secretion of soluble
factors that might contribute in an autocrine fashion to the
growth inhibitory activity, cells were treated for 4 hours with
flagellin, washed, and replenished with fresh medium for
another 6 hours. Then, the medium was collected as conditioned medium. We found that conditioned medium from
MCF-7 cells treated with flagellin decreased the colony size in

comparison with the untreated control or the conditioned
medium from flagellin-treated TLR5 knocked down cells
(Fig. 4B). Thus, at least, in part, flagellin-induced soluble
factors mediate the antiproliferation effect on breast cancer
cells. To further investigate the molecular mechanisms in
activation of cytokine signaling by flagellin-induced soluble
factors in breast cancer cells, the phosphorylation levels of
STATs were analyzed by Western blotting after flagellin
treatment. As expected, the phosphorylation of STAT1 and
STAT3 was induced by flagellin in later stage, suggesting that
cytokine-induced signaling pathways were activated in breast
cancer cells (Fig. 4C). Thus, these data indicate that the soluble
factors induced by flagellin in an autocrine fashion are
involved in an antigrowth effect of flagellin on breast cancer
cells.
Activation of TLR5 by flagellin inhibits tumor growth in
vivo
To determine the effect of flagellin on tumor growth in vivo,
we first used MCF-7 breast cancer cell xenograft mouse model.
After the palpable tumors were established, the mice were
injected with or without flagellin solution (1.0 mg in 50 mL)
around the tumor site and administrated every 2 days. As
shown in Figure 5A, tumors in the control group increased
from 52  13 to 428  178 mm3 whereas tumors in the
flagellin-treated group increased only from 48  12 to 162 
35 mm3. The average weight of tumors from the control group
was 425  11 mg, whereas the average weight in flagellintreated group was only 168  5 mg (Fig. 5A), suggesting that
flagellin retarded tumor growth in the xenograft mouse breast

tumor model. Flagellin had no significant effect on the body
weight of mice, indicating low toxicity of flagellin at the test
dosage and conditions (data not shown). However, in the
mouse inoculated with TLR5 shRNA–expressing MCF-7 cells,
although the cells maintained similar growth rate in vivo
compared with wild-type cells, flagellin failed to inhibit tumor
growth in vivo (Supplementary Fig. S3), indicating that TLR5dependent antitumor activity is involved in this flagellin
response.
To gain more evidence with other breast cancer cells, we
established MDA-MB-468 xenograft tumor model, in which
the tumors are estrogen independent (28). Flagellin also
significantly retarded tumor growth and decreased tumor
weight when administrated with flagellin around the tumor
sites (Fig. 5B). To access the antitumor activity of flagellin in
mice with established larger tumor burden, we further allowed
MDA-MB-468 tumor to grow up to 80 to 100 mm3. Then, we
intravenously administrated flagellin at 2 mg per mouse and
injected every week. We found that the systemic administration of flagellin also inhibited tumor growth and decreased
tumor weight (Fig. 5C). Because systemic administration of
flagellin might also elicit apoptotic signaling and systemic
inflammatory responses in mice (29), we further analyzed the
potential toxicity of flagellin by intravenous administration.
Similar to a previous report, systemic administration of flagellin induced serum production of IL-6 in early time points.
However, the level of IL-6 returned to baseline level 24 hours
later (Supplementary Fig. S4A). Moreover, histologic examination of the livers and spleens revealed no obvious inflammation, necrosis, or fibrosis between control and treatment

spleen, lung, and heart weights, were unaffected in flagellintreated groups (Supplementary Fig. S4; data not shown). Thus,
these data collectively indicate that flagellin exhibits minimal
toxic effects in normal animals when systemically administered by intravenous injection at the test dosage.

examination of tumor sections revealed that tumor necrosis
and leukocytes infiltration were increased in the flagellintreated group. Moreover, immunohistochemical staining for
cell proliferation marker PCNA in tumor sections indicated
that although PCNA was noticeably higher in MCF-7 cellinjected mice, the expression of this protein was inhibited by
treatment of flagellin (Fig. 6B). To determine the infiltrated
cell type in flagellin-treated tumors, we performed immunohistochemistry with tumor xenografts by using antibodies
against neutrophil- and macrophage-specific marks (Gr-1
and F4/80, respectively). There were no obvious F4/80-positive
cells in tumor sections either from control or flagellin-treated
groups (Supplementary Fig. S5). However, Gr-1–positive cells

were significantly increased around necrotic areas of tumor
sections from flagellin-treated groups (Fig. 6B), indicating that
TLR5 activation by flagellin leads to increased neutrophil
infiltration in vivo. As neutrophils have been shown to exhibit
potent antitumor activity in tumor microenvironment (21, 30,
31), these data indicate that the increase of neutrophil infiltration could be an important mechanism for TLR5/flagellininduced antitumor activity in vivo.

Discussion
Recent evidence suggests that TLRs, key receptors in innate
immunity, play a role in tumorigenesis but different TLRs
exhibit either antitumor or protumor activities (11). In this
study, we investigated the expression and function of TLR5 in
breast cancer epithelial cells. We found that TLR5 was specifically expressed in the ductal epithelium of normal breast
tissues, implicating a role of TLRs in inflammatory responses
of the mammary tissue against pathogen infection (32). Interestingly, we also found that most of human breast cancer

www.aacrjournals.org

samples expressed TLR5 and there was an enhanced expression of TLR5 in some subtypes of breast carcinomas. Because
the endogenous ligands for TLR5 in tumors are not known, we
used flagellin, the natural ligand of TLR5, to examine the
activity of TLR5 signaling in breast cancer cells. Similar to
other reports in immune sentinel cells and fibroblasts (33, 34),
activation of TLR5 by flagellin in breast cancer cells induced
the secretion of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines.
It is worthwhile to note that not every breast cancer cell line
we tested was responsive for flagellin stimulation and there
was no simple correlation between TLR5 expression and
flagellin sensitivity in these breast cancer cell lines. Because
we also observed the differences in subcellular localization of
TLR5 between flagellin-sensitive and nonsensitive cell lines,
the surface localization of TLR5 in flagellin-sensitive cells
might explain why these cells are highly responsive for flagellin
stimulation, which is similar to other TLRs (35).
In fibroblasts and DCs, TLR5/flagellin signaling pathway has
been shown to promote cell proliferation and prevent apoptosis by inducing p27 degradation, which can be antagonized

by type I IFNs (33, 34). In contrast, our results show that
activation of TLR5 by flagellin in breast cancer cells inhibits
cell proliferation and anchorage-independent growth. As cellspecific TLR5 signaling might account for our different results,
we also observed significant decrease of cell cyclin proteins
with marginal increase of p27 levels in breast cancer cells upon
flagellin treatment. We found that flagellin-induced soluble
factors exhibited suppressive activity on tumor cell proliferation, suggesting that the effect of flagellin on cancer cell
proliferation is not primarily mediated by the direct intracellular mechanism of TLR5 as previously reported in fibroblasts
and DCs (33, 34). In these flagellin-induced soluble factors,
several factors such as MIP-3a and IL-6 have been shown to
inhibit proliferation of various types of cells including breast
cancer cells (36, 37). However, in other scenarios, these factors
have also been reported to promote cell proliferation and
tumor growth (38, 39). The different results are dependent
upon different cell types and different combinations with other
factors in tumor microenvironment (40). Moreover, we
observed flagellin-induced phosphorylation of STAT1 and
STAT3 in breast cancer cells at late stages, further suggesting
that cytokine-induced signaling pathways were activated in
breast cancer cells after flagellin treatment. As a key mediator
of cytokine-induced gene expression, STAT1 is activated by
many cytokines including type I and type II IFNs (41). While we
failed to detect the secretion of type I and type II IFNs upon
flagellin treatment for 24 hours (data not shown), the phosphorylation of STAT1 suggests that other factors may be
involved in cytokine-induced signaling pathway upon flagellin
treatment and initiate a unique TLR5-signaling pathway in
breast cancer cells to inhibit cell growth.
As a receptor highly expressed in intestinal epithelial cells,
including colon cancer cells, TLR5 has been shown to mediate
antitumor activity in a mouse xenograft model of human
colon cancer (21). Consistent with this study, our data show
that administration of flagellin in vivo retards tumor growth in
the xenograft mouse model of human breast cancer. As we
observed in vitro, flagellin induced secretion of endogenous
cytokines and chemokines including MIP-3a, ENA-78, GRO-a,
and MDC. These factors have been shown to attract monocytes, neutrophils, and lymphocytes to the site of infection
(23–27). In agreement with the report by Rhee and colleagues,

which showed that infiltration of neutrophils induced by
flagellin exert potent antitumor responses in a mouse xenograft model of human colon cancer, we observed increased
tumor necrosis and leukocyte infiltration upon flagellin treatment either by peritumoral or intravenous injection. Interestingly, a recent report also observed that flagellin induced
expression of several chemokines to recruit neutrophils and
monocytes in vitro in prostate cancer cells (42). Thus, these
data suggest that the flagellin-induced proinflammatory factors further recruit neutrophils at the tumor site to modulate
the growth of breast tumors.
Dynamic interaction between tumor and tumor microenvironment is essential for tumor growth, angiogenesis, and
metastasis (43). Activation of TLRs on tumor cells has been
shown to modulate tumor microenvironment and elicit proor antitumor activities. Manipulating TLR signaling to
enhance its antitumor effects in tumor microenvironment
has been investigated and reported by several studies (44, 45).
In this study, we identified that TLR5 was highly expressed and
activated in breast carcinomas and cancer cells. Furthermore,
we showed that activation of TLR5 by flagellin in breast cancer
cells modulate the production of proinflammatory cytokines
to elicit a potent antitumor activity in breast cancer, which
may serve as a novel therapeutic target for human breast
cancer therapy.
