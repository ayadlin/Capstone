Abstract
The mitotic checkpoint is a mechanism that arrests the
progression to anaphase until all chromosomes have achieved
proper attachment to mitotic spindles. In cancer cells,
satisfaction of this checkpoint is frequently delayed or
prevented by various defects, some of which have been
causally implicated in tumorigenesis. At the same time,
deliberate induction of mitotic arrest has proved clinically
useful, as antimitotic drugs that interfere with proper
chromosome-spindle interactions are effective anticancer
agents. However, how mitotic arrest contributes to tumorigenesis or antimitotic drug toxicity is not well defined. Here,
we report that mitotic chromosomes can acquire DNA breaks
during both pharmacologic and genetic induction of mitotic
arrest in human cancer cells. These breaks activate a DNA
damage response, occur independently of cell death, and
subsequently manifest as karyotype alterations. Such breaks
can also occur spontaneously, particularly in cancer cells
containing mitotic spindle abnormalities. Moreover, we
observed evidence of some breakage in primary human cells.
Our findings thus describe a novel source of DNA damage in
human cells. They also suggest that mitotic arrest may
promote tumorigenesis and antimitotic toxicity by provoking
DNA damage. [Cancer Res 2007;67(24):11487–92]

Introduction
Mitosis is often abnormal in cancer cells (1). Among the defects
observed is frequent prolongation of prometaphase, which can
occur when the spindle checkpoint arrests progression to anaphase
(1). Several studies have now identified genetic abnormalities that
provoke such arrest (2). Some of these, such as loss of hCDC4 or
overexpression of MAD2, have been causally implicated in cancer
(3, 4). At the same time, antimitotic chemotherapeutics that induce
prolonged mitotic arrest and ‘‘mitotic slippage,’’ a process whereby
prometaphase cells return to interphase without undergoing
anaphase, can also elicit subsequent cell death or growth arrest
(1). Therefore, evidence suggests that events occurring during
mitotic arrest influence tumorigenesis and the toxicity of
antimitotic chemotherapy. However, the nature of these events is
not well defined (1). Interestingly, Wong and Stearns (5) have
shown that human cells that had been presynchronized with

double thymidine and the mictrotubule depolymerizer nocodazole
later possessed foci of g-H2AX, the phosphorylated form of histone
H2AX that forms around sites of DNA breaks. We thus wondered
whether DNA breaks might be generated during mitotic arrest in
human cancer cells.

Materials and Methods
Cell lines and treatments. All cell lines were from the American Type
Culture Collection, except BG-1 cells, which were from C. Moreno (Emory
University, Atlanta, GA). Cancer cells were cultured in McCoy’s and IMR90
cells in DMEM. Cells were seeded at a density of 3  104/cm2 onto
fibronectin-coated dishes or slides 24 h before the experiments. Nocodazole,
paclitaxel, and monastrol were used at 200 nmol/L, 100 nmol/L, and
200 Amol/L, respectively, the minimum concentrations that inhibited cell
division (data not shown). Q-VD-OPh was used at 50 Amol/L, the minimum
concentration that inhibited apoptosis (data not shown). g-Irradiation was
done with a Cs-137 Gammacell. Stealth Select siRNAs targeted to CENP-E,
control siRNA, and LipofectAMINE RNAiMax were obtained from, and used
according to the instructions of, Invitrogen. All analyses were done 24 h after
transfection.
Immunodetection. For immunocytochemistry, cells were fixed with 2%
formaldehyde/PBS and permeabilized with 20jC methanol. Antibody
incubations were 1 h at room temperature, and DNA was counterstained
with Hoechst. Images were acquired with a Zeiss Axiovert 100M confocal
microscope, except images of cells with spontaneous spindle defects, which
were acquired with a Zeiss Axioskop 2 Plus microscope. For flow cytometry,
cells were harvested by trypsinization and fixed overnight at 20jC in 70%
ethanol. Antibody incubations were 1 h at room temperature, and DNA
was counterstained with propidium iodide. Data were acquired using a
FACSCalibur (Becton Dickinson) and analyzed with CellQuest. Immunoblotting was done as previously described (6). Antibodies used and image
quantification methods are detailed in Supplementary Methods.
Time-lapse imaging. Phase-contrast images of cells grown inside a
37jC, 5% CO2 chamber were automatically obtained at 6-min intervals in
multiple locations using an Olympus IX81 microscope. All images were
analyzed with Slidebook.
Cytogenetic analyses. Chromosome spreads were prepared using
standard cytogenetic techniques; DNA was stained with 4¶,6-diamidino-2phenylindole; and images were obtained with a Zeiss Axioskop 2 Plus
microscope. Scoring of chromosome aberrations was done according to the
classification of Savage (7).

Results and Discussion
To address whether human cancer cells acquire DNA damage
during mitotic arrest, we first examined nocodazole-arrested
HCT116 colon cancer cells for the presence of g-H2AX foci. During
36 h of treatment, nocodazole produced a transient increase in
mitotic index that peaked at 12 h and was followed by mitotic
slippage (Supplementary Fig. S1). Whereas control prometaphase
cells exhibited few g-H2AX foci, nocodazole-arrested prometaphase
cells showed a time-dependent increase in g-H2AX foci per cell
(Fig. 1A and B). A similar increase was observed after treatment

with the microtubule stabilizer paclitaxel and the Eg5 mitotic
kinesin inhibitor monastrol (Fig. 1A), indicating that agents that
induce mitotic arrest through different mechanisms also induce
g-H2AX foci. Notably, cells exposed to drug treatment, but not yet
in mitosis, displayed no increase in g-H2AX foci (Supplementary
Fig. S2), indicating that only cells that have entered mitosis exhibit
the response.
We next determined whether these g-H2AX foci recruit
additional proteins involved in the DNA damage response.
However, it has previously been shown in HeLa cells that whereas
g-H2AX foci form in irradiated mitotic cells, other DNA damage
response proteins are only recruited once cells return to interphase
(8). Because we also observed this lack of recruitment of DNA
damage response proteins in mitotic HCT116 cells (data not
shown), we examined the cells after 36 h of nocodazole treatment,
at which point virtually all cells had undergone mitotic slippage
(Supplementary Fig. S1). Indeed, these postmitotic cells had

increased g-H2AX foci (Fig. 1D), which recruited the DNA damage
response protein 53BP1 and a phospho-activated form of ATM
(pATM; Fig. 1C). Thus, g-H2AX foci acquired during mitotic arrest,
like those produced by g-irradiation, recruit other DNA damage
response proteins once cells have exited mitosis.
Pharmacologic induction of mitotic arrest is accompanied by
some degree of cell death in most cell lines, and g-H2AX formation
can participate in apoptosis (1, 9). We thus investigated whether
g-H2AX formed during mitotic arrest represents ongoing cell
death. Live-cell videomicroscopy indicated that <1% of cells died in
a 30-h period after release from a 6-h nocodazole arrest (Fig. 2B
and Supplementary Movie 1), whereas 25% of cells died if
continuously treated with the drug (Fig. 2B and Supplementary
Movie 2). Given that the average g-H2AX per cell is increased
2.5-fold after 6 h of nocodazole (Fig. 1B) but 99% of these cells
survive following drug washout, acquisition of g-H2AX foci must
precede any eventual commitment to cell death. Consistent with

DNA Damage and Mitotic Arrest

this, only cells with apoptotic nuclear morphology, which
comprised <10% of the total after 18 h nocodazole, exhibited
caspase-3 cleavage, cytoplasmic localization of cytochrome c, or
activation of BAX, whereas mitotic cells with normal nuclear
morphology and abundant g-H2AX foci displayed none of these
events (Fig. 2A). Moreover, in contrast to the g-H2AX foci seen in
mitotic cells, apoptotic cells exhibited a distinct g-H2AX staining
pattern at the periphery of apoptotic chromatin (Fig. 2A). Finally,
cotreatment of nocodazole-arrested cells with the caspase inhibitor
Q-VD-OPh (10) produced a 98% inhibition of apoptotic cells but
no inhibition of g-H2AX foci (Fig. 2C). Taken together, these data
indicate that whereas death indeed follows mitotic arrest in a
fraction of HCT116 cells, such death is neither the cause of nor the
obligatory conclusion to g-H2AX foci acquired during mitotic
arrest.
To explore the downstream consequences of this DNA damage,
we examined cells for the presence of acquired chromosome
aberrations. Whereas untreated cells harbored few spontaneous
aberrations (Fig. 3A), cells that were grown in drug-free medium for
20 h following release from an 18-h nocodazole arrest exhibited a
6-fold increase in the frequency of chromosome breaks (Supplementary table). The majority were of the chromosome type, such
as double minutes, acentric fragments, and dicentrics [Fig. 3, B
(bottom inset) and C (all insets)], consistent with g-H2AX data
indicating that breaks arise during mitotic arrest, and thus before
subsequent DNA replication. However, some chromatid-type

www.aacrjournals.org

aberrations were also observed (Fig. 3B, top inset), raising the
possibility that additional DNA lesions, such as single-stranded
breaks, base damages, or postreplication double-strand breaks,
might be acquired by the cells (7, 11). Notably, aberrations were
observed not only in tetraploid cells produced through mitotic
slippage (Fig. 3C) but also in near-diploid cells generated from cell
division following drug washout (Fig. 3B), indicating that breaks
occur even in cells that recover from transient arrest. Thus, DNA
breaks incurred during mitotic arrest manifest as structural
karyotype changes in subsequent cell cycles.
We next asked whether a genetic induction of mitotic arrest
might also provoke DNA damage. Because depletion of the
kinetochore protein CENP-E disrupts chromosome-spindle interactions and induces transient mitotic arrest in human cancer cells
(12–14), we examined HCT116 cells that had been transfected with
siRNAs against this protein. Consistent with previous reports,
CENP-E siRNAs produced an elevated mitotic index (Fig. 4B) and
aberrant mitotic figures (Fig. 4C, left) as compared with control
siRNA, indicating the induction of mitotic arrest. Moreover, CENPE–depleted prometaphase cells exhibited an increase in g-H2AX
foci (Fig. 4C). Thus, genetic induction of mitotic arrest, like that
elicited by antimitotic agents, provokes g-H2AX foci in HCT116
cells.
Interestingly, while carrying out g-H2AX immunocytochemistry,
we noticed that occasional untreated mitotic HCT116 cells bore
characteristics of prolonged mitotic arrest: a prometaphase

arrangement of chromosomes and abundant g-H2AX foci. We thus
wondered whether these cells might contain spontaneous spindle
defects, which can disrupt mitotic progression (15, 16). Of 4,000
mitotic cells examined, prometaphase cells with marked elevation
of g-H2AX foci comprised 2.2% of the total, and 69% of these
contained either monopolar or multipolar spindles (Fig. 4D). In
contrast, only 5.3% of prometaphase cells with minimal g-H2AX
foci contained mitotic spindle abnormalities. Thus, the frequency
of prometaphase g-H2AX elevation was increased 13-fold in cells
with spontaneous spindle defects (m2 P < 0.0001). Of note, prophase
cells with nascent monopolar or multipolar spindles did not
possess elevated g-H2AX foci (Supplementary Fig. S3), suggesting
that g-H2AX–intense mitotic cells acquire their foci during, and
not before, prometaphase. These data indicate that prometaphase
acquisition of g-H2AX foci can occur spontaneously in HCT116
cells and may arise during mitotic arrest provoked by spindle
abnormalities.
Finally, we explored the extent to which this phenomenon occurs
in other human cells. Of eight colorectal cancer lines (including
HCT116) exposed to nocodazole, six exhibited a g-H2AX increase
in some or most mitotic cells (Supplementary Fig. S4). Increased
g-H2AX was also observed in HeLa cervical cancer cells and BG-1
ovarian cancer cells (Supplementary Fig. S4). Thus, DNA damage
during mitotic arrest is a common occurrence in human cancer
cells. Additionally, we observed a modest g-H2AX increase in
IMR90 primary human fibroblasts (Supplementary Fig. S4),
suggesting that even nontransformed human cells can acquire
some DNA damage during mitotic arrest. However, the degree of
g-H2AX induction in primary cells was lower than in the majority
of cancer lines, suggesting that malignant cells may be more prone
to this damage.
Our study shows that many human cells acquire DNA damage
during mitotic arrest. While the mechanism responsible for this

damage remains an area for future work, our results have several
important implications. First, although unscheduled DNA breaks
are known to derive from sources such as replication, oxidative
stress, and exogenous mutagens (17), it was hitherto unknown that
such breaks could accumulate during mitotic arrest. As such, our
findings describe a novel source of DNA damage. Second, because
cancer cells frequently contain mitotic defects that induce arrest
(1, 18), and because DNA breaks can promote tumorigenesis (17),
our findings suggest that one way mitotic arrest may promote
tumorigenesis is through DNA damage. Along these lines, it is
interesting to note that inactivation of the tumor suppressor
hCDC4 and oncogenic overexpression of MAD2 are accompanied
not only by prolongation of mitosis and aneuploidy but also by
evidence of DNA damage (3, 4). Our results suggest that breaks
acquired during mitotic arrest could contribute to the damage
observed in these systems. In this way, mitotic arrest may be a
source of structural, as well as numerical, chromosomal instability
in human cells.
At the same time, this and other studies indicate that cells that
endure prolonged or complete inhibition of mitosis exhibit reduced
reproductive capacity (1). Indeed, although cell death was not the
compulsory fate of HCT116 cells that acquired damage during
mitotic arrest, we did observe subsequent death in a fraction of
cells. Given that g-H2AX foci increased with time of mitotic arrest,
and that the cytotoxicity of DNA damage is dose dependent, a third
implication of our findings is that extensive DNA damage imposed
by prolonged or complete inhibition of mitosis may promote cell
death or growth arrest. In this way, our data support and extend
the idea offered by Wong and Stearns (5) that the growth arrest
following pharmacologic induction of mitotic arrest ( formerly
known as the ‘‘tetraploidy checkpoint’’) may, at least in some
contexts, be a response to DNA damage. Moreover, this
consequence may have clinical implications: given the variable

degree of g-H2AX formed on drug-induced arrest in different cancer
cell lines, it is plausible that the sensitivity of a tumor to antimitotic
chemotherapy could be influenced by its propensity to sustain
DNA damage during mitotic arrest. By extension, efforts to identify
markers of this propensity might aid attempts to tailor antimitotic
chemotherapy to susceptible tumors, as is currently being tried with
markers of numerical chromosomal instability (19).
Lastly, our findings do not support a recent report that
microtubule-destabilizing agents elicit DNA breaks during G1
phase, and not mitosis (20). Although we do corroborate these

www.aacrjournals.org

authors’ finding that such agents induce breaks, our data indicate
that these breaks arise on mitotic chromosomes. This explains
why even cells that divide following mitotic arrest possess DNA
damage, and it indicates that some yet undefined property of
mitosis itself commonly confers vulnerability to DNA damage in
human cancer cells.
