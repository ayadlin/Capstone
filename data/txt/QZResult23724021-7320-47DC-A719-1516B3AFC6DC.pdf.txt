ABSTRACT
Through comprehensive comparison study, we found that ibrutinib, a clinically
approved covalent BTK kinase inhibitor, was highly active against EGFR (L858R,
del19) mutant driven NSCLC cells, but moderately active to the T790M ‘gatekeeper’
mutant cells and not active to wild-type EGFR NSCLC cells. Ibrutinib strongly affected
EGFR mediated signaling pathways and induced apoptosis and cell cycle arrest
(G0/G1) in mutant EGFR but not wt EGFR cells. However, ibrutinib only slowed
down tumor progression in PC-9 and H1975 xenograft models. MEK kinase inhibitor,
GSK1120212, could potentiate ibrutinib’s effect against the EGFR (L858R/T790M)
mutation in vitro but not in vivo. These results suggest that special drug administration
might be required to achieve best clinical response in the ongoing phase I/II clinical
trial with ibrutinib for NSCLC.

lymphoma (MCL), chronic lymphatic lymphoma (CLL),
diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), multiple
myeloma (MM), and acute myeloid leukemia (AML).
Recently it was approved for the clinical treatment of
MCL and CLL. [1–7] Ibrutinib has also been studied

INTRODUCTION
Ibrutinib (PCI-32765), an irreversible BTK kinase
inhibitor, has been extensively studied in a variety
of hematopoietic malignancies, such as mantle cell

in preclinical inflammation models. [8–10] Besides its
potent activity against BTK kinase, previous studies have
shown that ibrutinib may also potently inhibit BMX, BLK,
EGFR, and Her2 kianses. [10]
EGFR is a receptor tyrosine kinase that regulates
downstream signaling cascades such as PI3K/Akt/mTOR
and Ras/RAF/MEK/ERK etc. [11] Gain-of-function
mutations of EGFR such as L858R, exon 19 deletion
(Del 19), which account for around 90% of all EGFR
mutations, can lead to tumorigenesis. [12] First generation
EGFR inhibitors, such as Gefitinib and Erlotinib, have
exhibited great anti-tumor activity against the EGFR
(L858R) and EGFR (del 19) mutation- driven NSCLC.
[13] However, the efficacy of chronic treatment with
Gefitinib and Erlotinib is at best transient due to signaling
bypass resistance mechanisms such as Her2 and MET
amplification, or acquired EGFR gatekeeper T790M
mutation. [14, 15] This has encouraged the development
of second-generation EGFR inhibitors such as Apatinib
(BIBW2992), Neratinib and Dacomitinib, which
work through formation of a covalent bond with Cys797.
[16–18] However, due to the lack of selectivity between
the wt EGFR and mutant EGFR, these drugs showed doselimiting toxicities, which led to develop third generation
EGFR (T790M) inhibitors, such as WZ4002, CO-1686
and AZD9291. [19–22]
Recently ibrutinib has been reported to exhibit antitumor activities in EGFR mutant NSCLC and currently
under phase I/II clinical trial for the previously treated
NSCLC (NCT02321540). [23] Combining the previously
reported biochemical activity of ibrutinib against wt
EGFR and the fact that similar reactive cysteine residues
are located at the same positions in EGFR and BTK,
we performed a comprehensive comparison study of
ibrutinib against NSCLC in vitro and in vivo. We found

that ibrutinib exhibited selective anti-proliferation activity
against EGFR primary mutants (L858R, del19)-expressing
cancer cells but moderately active against drug induced
secondary gate-keeper T790M mutation and not active
against wt EGFR-expressing cells. [10] In addition,
ibrutinib exhibited superior selectivity between mutant and
wide type EGFR in comparison with clinical stage EGFR
inhibitors such as BIBW2992, CO1686 and AZD9291.
Ibrutinib could be effectively combined with MEK kinase
inhibitor GSK1120212 against the EGFR secondary mutant
(L858/T790M). However, these potent anti-proliferation
activities could not directly transform into PC-9 and
H1975 xenografts models. These results indicated that
ibrutinib might be a potential drug candidate for the
EGFR (L858R, del19) mutant driven NSCLC and a useful
candidate for combinatorial therapy aimed at overcoming
(L858R/T790M) resistance in NSCLC. But considering the
discrepancies observed between the in vitro and in vivo,
special administration design might be required to achieve
the best drug response in the solid NSCLC tumor.

RESULTS
Ibrutinib selectively inhibits the proliferation of
EGFR mutant NSCLC cancer cell lines
We first screened a panel of NSCLC cancer cell
lines and found that only mutant EGFR-expressing cell
lines, such as H3255 (EGFR L858R, GI50: 0.11 μM), PC-9
(EGFR Del 19, GI50: 0.05 μM), and HCC827 (EGFR Del
19, GI50: 0.063 μM), are sensitive to ibrutinib treatment.
(Table 1) A similar trend was observed with other EGFR
inhibitors, including BIBW2992, WZ4002, CO-1686,
AZD9291 and Gefitinib. Interestingly, the H1975 cell line
(EGFR L858R/T790M) was only moderately sensitive to

ibrutinib (GI50: 1.2 μM) compared with other EGFR T790M
mutation-targeting drugs. Unlike the other agents, ibrutinib
did not exhibit any inhibitory effect against wt EGFRexpressing cancer cell lines, which suggests a superior
selectivity window (Table 1). Intriguingly, a reversible
version of ibrutinib (PCI-R, structure shown in Fig. S1), in
which the acrylamide is replaced with a propionamide group,
lost most of the activity against these otherwise sensitive
cell lines. To further confirm the activity of ibrutinib against
mutant EGFR-expressing cell lines, we conducted colony
formation assays. The results demonstrated that for the
EGFR L858R/T790M mutant-driven H1975 cell line,
ibrutinib showed moderate anti-colony formation activity
(EC50: 604.7 nM), which is similar to that of CO-1686 (EC50:
605.8 nM). (Table S1 and Fig. S2A) WZ4002 showed the
strongest inhibitory activity (EC50: 12 nM) and AZD9291
exhibited less activity (EC50: 118 nM). AZD9291 exhibited
an EC50 of 2.5 nM against the PC-9 cell line. Ibrutinib and
WZ4002 showed similar efficacy (EC50: 16 nM and 11 nM
respectively), while CO-1686 exhibited an EC50 of 56 nM.
(Fig. S2B) AZD9291 demonstrated the strongest activity
against the HCC827 cell line (EC50: 1.2 nM). WZ4002 and
CO-1686 showed similar activities (EC50: 10 nM and 11 nM
respectively), while ibrutinib was relatively less potent
(EC50: 155 nM) (Fig. S2C) For H3255 cell line, AZD9291
displayed the strongest anti-colony formation activity (EC50:
5.5 nM). Ibrutinib and WZ4002 were moderately active
(EC50: 23.4 nM and 89 nM), whereas CO1686 was relatively
less active (EC50: 210.8 nM). (Fig. S2D)

The result showed that ibrutinib was most potent against
EGFR (L858R/T790M) (IC50: 9 nM), moderately potent
against EGFR (T790M) (IC50: 50 nM), however slightly
less potent against wt EGFR (IC50: 96 nM). (Table 2 and
Fig. S3) A similar activity trend was observed for WZ4002,
CO-1686 and AZD9291. (Fig. S3) Mass spectrum study
with EGFR(T790M) protein revealed that ibrutinib did
inhibit EGFR kinase through formation of a covalent
bond with Cys797 amino acid and further confirmed the
inhibitory activity loss with PCI-R compound observed
in Table 1. (Fig. S4) For auto-phosphorylation of
EGFR Y1068 in intact cell lines, ibrutinib exhibited an
EC50 of 23–58 nM in EGFR primary mutant cell lines
(PC-9, HCC827, and H3255) and relatively weaker
potency in EGFR L858R/T790M mutant cells (H1975:
EC50: 145  nM). (Table 3 and Fig. S5) Interestingly,
in the wt EGFR-expressing A431 cell line, the autophosphorylation of EGFR Y1068 was significantly
inhibited by ibrutinib (EC50: 49 nM), while WZ4002
(EC50: 1436 nM), CO1686 (EC50: > 3000 nM) and
AZD9291(EC50: 818 nM) were much less potent.
AZD9291 displayed the strongest inhibitory activities
against both the primary (L858R, Del19) and secondary
drug resistant mutations (L858R/T790M) EGFR Y1068
phosphorylation, and the best selectivity between the
drug resistant mutant and wt (EC50: 6 nM versus 818
nM). CO1686 was relatively less potent than AZD9291
and WZ4002, however still exhibited 100-fold selectivity
between drug-resistant mutant and wt EGFR Y1068
phosphorylation. These results of inhibitory activities
for EGFR Y1068 phosphorylation are in contrast to the
results observed in the anti-proliferation assay performed
with the A431 cell line (GI50: ibrutinib > 10 μM), which
suggests that there may be off-targets effects with
WZ4002 (GI50: 1.0 μM), CO1686 (GI50: 1.2  μM) and
AZD9291 (GI50: 0.096 μM) that contributed to the growth

inhibitory activity other than by inhibition of EGFR in
A431 cell line which require further more detailed study.
(Table 1) In addition, we found that auto-phosphorylation
of Y1173 is in general much more sensitive than Y1068
to all of the drugs which is in accordance with the fact
the phosphorylation of Y1068 phosphorylation is a
prerequisite for phosphorylation of Y1173. [24]

treatment for 22 days showed a tumor progression slow
down efficacy, though there was no significant difference
between the different dosages (25 mg/Kg, versus 50 mg/
Kg and 100 mg/Kg BID). (Fig. 2A) However, Gefitinib and
WZ4002, which have exhibited similar anti-proliferation
effect for PC-9 cells in vitro, almost completely suppressed
the tumor growth. In the H1975 xenograft mouse model,
23-day continuous (50 mg/kg BID) drug treatment also
slowed down tumor progression. Not surprisingly, Gefitinib
completely lost the anti-tumor efficacy and WZ4002 almost
completely suppressed the tumor growth. Again, a higher
dosage of ibrutinib (100 mg/Kg BID) did not improve
efficacy. (Fig. 2B)

Ibrutinib selectively affects mutant EGFR
mediated signaling pathways
We then investigated the effect of ibrutinib on EGFRmediated signaling in both ibrutinib- sensitive and ibrutinibinsensitive NSCLC cell lines. The results demonstrated
that ibrutinib potently inhibited both EGFR wt/mutant
auto-phosphorylation at Y1068. (Fig. 1A and Fig. S6) In
sensitive cell lines (H1975, PC-9, H3255, HCC827) it also
potently inhibited targets downstream of ERK. (Fig. 1A
and Fig. S7A) Interestingly, it significantly affected the
phosphorylation of Akt Thr308 and Ser473 in H1975 cells,
however not the other three mutant EGFR-expressing cell
lines. (Fig. 1A, Fig. S7B, S7C) Although it did not have
apparent enzymatic activity against PI3K kinase. (Fig. S8)
This is different from other reported third generation
EGFR inhibitors (WZ4002, CO1686 and AZD9291) that
can significantly affect the phosphorylation of AktS473
in L858R and del 19 mutant cancer cell lines. In addition,
in wt EGFR-expressing NSCLC cell lines, such as H460,
A549 and A431, none of the downstream mediators were
affected. (Fig. S6)

Ibrutinib and the MEK inhibitor GSK1120212
combinatorially suppress EGFR (L858R/T790M)
mutant H1975 cells proliferation
Considering ibrutinib only exhibited moderate
activity against drug acquired resistant mutant EGFR
(L858R/T790M)-driven H1975 cells, we sought to explore
a drug combination strategy to potentiate the growth
inhibitory efficacy of ibrutinib. The EGFR gatekeeper
mutant T790M causes drug resistance primarily due to
the increased binding affinity to ATP but not the canonical
steric hindrance. [25] Several different combination
strategies have been explored, such as EGFR monoclonal
antibody Cetuximab combination with EGFR inhibitor
Afatinib or BIBW2992, allele-specific DNAzyme cDzT
with EGFR inhibitor BIBW-2992, and MAPK signaling
pathway MEK inhibitor GSK1120212 combination
with  EGFR inhibitor CO1686. [26–28] Given the fact
that both in biochemical assays and cellular colony
formation assays ibrutinib and CO-1686 have similar
potencies against the EGFR T790M mutation, we then
tried to combine MEK kinase inhibitor GSK1120212 with
ibrutinib to see if it could potentiate the anti-proliferation
efficacy of ibrutinib. The results demonstrated that the
combination of Trametinib (used at around the GI50 of
1.1μM) with 1.1μM ibrutinib is able to effectively block
the growth of the cells. (Fig. 2C and Table S2) However,
the combination with ibrutinib (50 mg/Kg, BID) and
Trametinib (10 mg/Kg, BID) did not demonstrate
apparent combinatorial effect in H1975 tumor xenograft
model. (Fig. 2D)

Ibrutinb selectively inhibits EGFR mutant cells
lines cell cycle progression and induces apoptosis
We next investigated the effect of ibrutinib on
cell cycle progression. The FACS results showed that
ibrutinib could arrest H1975 cells in G0/G1 phase in
a concentration- and time-dependent manner, which
mimics the efficacy of WZ4002. (Fig. 1B) A similar effect
was observed in PC-9, HCC827 and H3255 cell lines.
(Fig.  1B and Fig. S9) However, neither ibrutinib nor
WZ4002 or CO-1686 could arrest cell cycle progression
in wt EGFR-expressing H460 cells. In addition, ibrutinib
also demonstrated a concentration- and time-dependent
induction of apoptosis in H1975 cells as evidenced by
PARP and Caspase-3 cleavage. This apoptotic effect was
also observed in PC-9 and H3255 cell lines, however not
in the H460 cell line. (Fig. 1C) These results again validate
that ibrutinib is effective against mutant EGFR-expressing
cells through induction of cell cycle arrest and apoptosis,
however not wt EGFR-expressing cells.

DISCUSSION
Interestingly, despite the preferred selectivity
between wt EGFR and EGFR L858R/T790M shown in
the in vitro biochemical assays, this trend did not translate
into the in-cell auto-phosphorylation assay by looking at
Y1068 site. This might be due to assay format differences,
since the biochemical assay examines the inhibitory
activity against downstream target phosphorylation

and in vivo might be due to the formulation problems
since we did not have access to the clinically used
formulation of the drug. However, the other reason might
be the unfavorable PK property of ibrutinib against solid
tumors since it has been primarily developed against the
leukemia (CLL) and lymphoma (MCL) cancers. If, then,
an alternative drug formulation, such as nanomaterialmediated controlled release, might be helpful to improve
the anti-tumor efficacy, which requires further detailed
study.
In summary, the anti-tumor progression efficacy
combined with the already clinically validated safety
profile during clinical testing as a BTK kinase inhibitor
makes ibrutinib a potentially useful drug candidate for
first line treatment of EGFR primary mutation- driven
NSCLC. The combination of ibrutinib with other
drugs as second line treatment option could also be

(here is a peptide substrate), while the auto-phosphorylation
assay examines the inhibitory ability to phosphorylate the
target protein (EGFR) itself. The other possibility is that in
biochemical assay the protein only comprises the kinase
domain while in the intact cells the EGFR is full-length.
The regulatory domain might play some roles in the protein
conformation and activities.
Although ibrutinib exhibited highly potent antiproliferation efficacy against PC-9 cells, it did not
completely suppress the PC-9 cell inoculated tumor
progression but only slowed down it. Furthermore, it did
not exhibit the dose-dependent efficacy among different
dosages in both PC-9 and H1975 cells mediated tumors.
However, with the similar formulation, Gefintib and
WZ4002 demonstrated much more superior anti-tumor
activities against PC-9 and/or H1975 tumor models. One
possible reason of this discrepancy between the in vitro

with wash buffer (40 mM Tris pH 7.9, 500 mM NaCl, 1%
Glycerol, 1 mM DTT), the beads were incubated overnight
with 5ml wash buffer containing 5ul of 5 mg/ml alphathrombin to remove GST tag. The eluted EGFR protein

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Inhibitors
Ibrutinib, BIBW-2992, W4002, CO-1686,
AZD9291, Gefinib and GSK1120212 were purchased
from Haoyuan Chemexpress Inc. PCI-R was synthesized
in the lab based on the procedure reported previously. [29]

ADP-Glo biochemical assay

Cell lines and cell culture

The ADP-Glo™ kinase assay (Promega, Madison,
WI) was used to screen Ibrutinib, WZ4002, CO1686, and
AZD9291 for its EGFR inhibition effects. The kinase
reaction system contains 4.95 μl EGFR (WT) (1.5 ng/
μl), EGFR (T790M) (6 ng/μl) or EGFR (T790M/L858R)
(1.5  ng/μl), 0.55 μl of serially diluted drug, and 5.5 μl
EGFR substrate Poly (4:1 Glu, Tyr) peptide (0.2 μg/μl)
(Promega, Madison, WI) with 40 μM ATP (Promega,
Madison, WI). The reaction in each tube was started
immediately by adding ATP and kept going for an hour
under 37°C. After the tube cooled for 5 minutes at room
temperature, 5 μl solvent reactions were carried out in
a 384-well plate. Then 5 μl of ADP-Glo™ reagent was
added into each well to stop the reaction and consume
the remaining ADP within 40 minutes. At the end, 10 μl
of kinase detection reagent was added into the well and
incubated for 30 minutes to produce a luminescence
signal. Luminescence signal was measured with an
automated plate reader (Perkin-Elmer Envision) and each
measurement was performed in triplicate.

The human cancer cell lines A549, A431, H3255,
H1975, PC-9, HCC827, H23, H460, A549, H358 and
H2122 cells were purchased from the American Type
Culture Collection (ATCC) (Manassas, VA, USA). H1975,
PC-9, HCC827, H23, H460, H358, H2122 and EGFR
mutant isogenic BaF3 cells lines were cultured in RPMI
1640 media (Corning, USA) with 10% fetal bovine serum
(FBS) and supplemented with 2% L-glutamine and 1%
penicillin/streptomycin. A549 and A431 were cultured
in DMEM media (Corning, USA) with 10% FBS and
supplemented with 2% L-glutamine and 1% pen/strep.
H3255 was cultured in BEGM media (LONZA, USA)
with 10% FBS and supplemented with 2% L-glutamine
and 1% pen/strep.

Proliferation studies
Cells were grown in 96-well culture plates
(2500–3000/well). For adherent cell lines, compounds of
various concentrations were added into the plates after
cells were cultured for 12 hours. Cell proliferation was
determined after treatment with compounds for 72 hours.
Cell viability was measured using the CellTiter–Glo
assay (Promega, USA), according to the manufacturer’s
instructions, and luminescence was measured in a multilabel reader (Envision, PerkinElmer, USA). Data were
normalized to control groups (DMSO) and represented
by the mean of three independent measurements with
standard error <20%. GI50 values were calculated using
Prism 5.0 (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA).

EGFR proteins purification for

CO1686 (0.3 μM) for 24 hours before cells were harvested
by trypsin and washed with cold PBS. The cells were fixed
in 70% cold ethanol and incubated at −20°C overnight then
stained with PI/RNase staining buffer (BD Pharmingen).
Flow cytometry was performed using a FACS Calibur (BD),
and results were analyzed by ModFit software.

(100% acetonitrile, 0.1% formic acid). The flow rate
through the column was 225 nL/min and the spray
voltage was 2.2 kV. The LTQ-Orbitrap was operated
in data-dependent scanning mode, with one full MS
scan (375–1600 m/z) in the orbitrap followed by MS/
MS scans of the 5 most abundant ions using the linear
ion trap with dynamic exclusion enabled. The MS data
was analyzed by Mascot v2.3.02 using a Uniprot Human
sequence database with two differential modifications:
Carbamidomethyl modification of 57.02146 on Cysteine
and ibrutinib modification of 440.1961 on Cysteine. For
the T790M mutant only, an additional “Thr to Met”
modification on Threonine was included. For each of the
wild-type and mutant samples, the LC-MS/MS analysis
was repeated twice with consistent results.

Signaling pathway effect examination
H1975, HCC827, PC9 and H3255 cells were
treated with serially diluted PCI32765, WZ4002 (1 μM)
for 4 hours. Cells were then washed with PBS and lysed
in cell lysis buffer. Phospho-EGF Receptor, PhosphoEGF Receptor (Tyr1068), Stat3, Phospho-Stat3 (Tyr705),
AKT, Phospho-AKT (Ser473), Phospho-AKT (Thr308),

Phospho-eIF4E (Ser209), 4E-BP1, Phospho-4E-BP1
(Thr37/46) antibody (Cell signaling Technology) were
used for immunoblotting.

Colony formation assay
The clonogenic activity of the cells was determined
by colony forming assays. Every six conditions of
drugs were analyzed (10 μM, 1 μM, 0.1 μM, 0.01 μM,
0.001 μM, DMSO). The cells (H1975, PC-9, HCC827,
H3255) were seeded at 600 cells/well in 2 ml medium
in 6-well plates. Cells were maintained in a humidified
5% CO2 incubator at 37°C for 10 days without changing
medium. After 10 days, the assays were stopped and the
cells were fixed with 3.5% formaldehyde and 70% ethanol
and subsequently stained with 0.02% crystal violet. The
total number of colonies exceeding 50 cells per colony
was counted and data were given as percentage with
respect to the controls.

Apoptosis effect examination
H1975 cells were treated with serially diluted
PCI32765, WZ4002 (1 μM) for 8, 18, 24 hours. H460
cells were treated with serially diluted PCI32765, WZ4002
(1 μM) for 48 hours. PC9, HCC827, H3255 were treated
with serially diluted PCI32765, WZ4002 (1 μM) for 24
hours. Cells were then washed in PBS and lysed in cell
lysis buffer. PARP, Caspase-3,GAPDH antibody (Cell
signaling Technology) were used for immunoblotting.

Mass spectrum experiment

Xenograft experiment

The purified EGFR protein (30 μg protein in
40  μL buffer of 50 mM Tris, 50 mM NaCl and 20
mM MgCl2) was incubated with DMSO or Ibrutinib
(50 μM) for 60 min at room temperature. The samples
were then subjected to in-solution trypsin digestion.
Briefly, the samples were denatured in 8 M urea
(160 μl of 10 M urea in PBS was added), reduced by
10 mM of dithiothreitol for 30 min at room temperature
(10 μl of 200 mM stock in water was added) and
alkylated by 20 mM iodoacetamide for 30 min at
room temperature in dark (20 μl of 100 mM stock in
water was added). The samples were diluted with
ammonium bicarbonate (25 mM, 570 μl) to 2 M urea
and  subjected to trypsin digestion (Promega; 4 μl of
0.5 μg/μl) overnight at 37°C in the presence of 2 mM
CaCl2. Digested peptide samples were desalted and
re-solubilized in 20uL Buffer A (95% water, 5%
acetonitrile, 0.1% formic acid). 2 uL of each sample
was analyzed by LC-MS/MS on a Velos Pro Orbitrap
Elite mass spectrometer (Thermo Scientific) coupled to
an Easy NanoLC. Peptides were eluted from the C18
column using a 30 min gradient of 2–75% Buffer B
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Xenograft models. 5 × 106 (PC-9) or 2 × 106
(NCI-H1975) cells (Per 100ul in PBS) were injected
subcutaneously into the right flanks of six-week-old
female Nude (Nu/Nu) mice (Charles River Laboratories).
Animals with 100 mm3 tumors were then randomized into
groups of 8~10 animals, and dosed twice daily (BID) with
Ibrutinib (25, 50, or 100 mg/kg/day) or administrated once
daily (QD) with Gefitinib (25 mg/kg/day) or WZ4002
(25 mg/kg/day) by oral gavage for about 3 weeks. Tumor
diameter was measured 3 times weekly. Tumor volumes
(V) were calculated by the equation (V = length × width
× width/2). ALL experiments and procedures followed
the guidelines of the Institutional Animal Care and Use
Committees of National Institue of Biological Sciences,
Beijing.
