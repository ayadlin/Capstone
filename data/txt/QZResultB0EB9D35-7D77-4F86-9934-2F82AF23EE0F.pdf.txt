Expression Required for Ovarian Cancer Chemoresistance

Abstract
Overexpression or ampliﬁcation of the RSF1 gene has been associated with poor prognosis in various human
cancers, including ovarian cancer. In previous work, RSF1 was identiﬁed as an ampliﬁed gene that facilitated the
development of paclitaxel-resistant ovarian cancer. In the present study, we further demonstrated that RSF1
expression inversely correlated with paclitaxel response in patients with ovarian cancer and the mouse xenograft
model. In addition, RSF1-overexpressing paclitaxel-resistant ovarian cancer cell lines were found to express
elevated levels of genes regulated by NF-kB, including some involved with the evasion of apoptosis (CFLAR,
XIAP, BCL2, and BCL2L1) and inﬂammation (PTGS2). In addition, ectopic expression of RSF1 using Tet-off
inducible SKOV3 cells signiﬁcantly enhanced NF-kB–dependent gene expression and transcriptional activation
of NF-kB. An RSF1 knockdown using short hairpin RNAs suppressed these same pathways. Moreover, pretreatment with NF-kB inhibitors or downregulation of NF-kB–regulated gene expression considerably enhanced
paclitaxel sensitivity in RSF1-overexpressing OVCAR3 and/or RSF1-induced SKOV3 cells. A coimmunoprecipitation assay revealed that RSF1 interacts with NF-kB and CREB-binding protein, a ubiquitous coactivator for NF-kB.
Recruitment of RSF1 to the NF-kB binding element in the PTGS2 and XIAP promoters was demonstrated by the
chromatin immunoprecipitation assay. Furthermore, hSNF2H, a well-known binding partner of RSF1, was
partially involved in the interaction between RSF1 and NF-kB. Taken together, these data suggest that RSF1
may function as a coactivator for NF-kB, consequently augmenting expression of genes necessary for the
development of chemoresistance in ovarian cancer cells. Cancer Res; 74(8); 2258–69. 2014 AACR.

Introduction
Ovarian cancer is the leading cause of death among gynecologic malignancies. Most patients present with advanced
stages (stages III–IV) due to the absence of clinically effective
screening methods (1). In these cases, combined treatment
with surgery and chemotherapy is necessary. First-line chemotherapy with platinum drugs and taxanes yields a response
rate of more than 80%; however, most patients will have a
recurrence (2). The recurrent cancers are frequently drug
resistant and are fatal in the majority of women. Chemotherapeutic resistance is one of the most important prognostic
factor for ovarian cancer (3).
RSF1, which is known as a histone-binding protein that
interacts with hSNF2H (SMARCA5), has been demonstrated to
play an important role in chromatin remodeling and tranAuthors' Afﬁliations: 1Department of Life and Nanopharmaceutical Science; 2Division of Molecular Biology, College of Pharmacy, Kyung Hee

scriptional regulation (4). Increasing evidence suggests that
the RSF1 gene is ampliﬁed and/or overexpressed in various
cancers, including ovarian (5), breast (6), bladder (7), esophageal (8), lung (9), colon cancer (10), and head and neck cancers
(11). Elevated levels of RSF1 are correlated with poor prognosis
(12). Inhibition of RSF1 was reported to reduce proliferation of
cancer cells (13), suggesting an important role for RSF1 ampliﬁcation and/or overexpression in the maintenance of cell
survival and growth. However, the molecular role of RSF1 in
cancer development and progression remains poorly understood. Previously, we found that RSF1 is frequently expressed
and upregulated in ovarian cancer cells (6). In addition, RSF1
has a role in mediating disease progression and aggressive
clinical behavior in patients with ovarian cancer (6, 14). It has
also been demonstrated that RSF1 contributes to paclitaxel
resistance, and the formation of the RSF1/hSNF2H complex is
required for inducing this phenotype (15). Interaction network
analysis using RSF1-regulated genes identiﬁed several molecular hubs in the functional network that may contribute to
drug resistance, including NF-kB and Akt (15). RSF1, also
known as hepatitis B X-antigen–associated protein (HBXAP),
was originally identiﬁed as a factor interacting with the hepatitis B virus (HBV)-X (HBX) protein (16). HBXAP/RSF1 was
found to increase HBV transcription in an HBX protein-dependent manner (17), and it was suggested at that time that
HBXAP/RSF1 regulates the transcriptional activity of NF-kB
(18, 19).

Involvement of NF-kB in RSF1-Induced Chemoresistance

NF-kB transcription factors are involved in disparate processes such as inﬂammation (20), growth and development
(21), and drug resistance (22). Many human cancers, including
ovarian cancer, possess high levels of constitutive NF-kB
activity, which can be further elevated by some anticancer
drugs and radiation (23). Indeed, an oncoproteomic analysis
study revealed that the NF-kB pathway is activated in recurrent ovarian carcinoma (24, 25). Activated NF-kB seems to
trigger a series of molecular reactions, including upregulation
of antiapoptotic protein-encoding genes (26) that induce
cancer chemoresistance. High NF-kB activity has been identiﬁed in drug-resistant cancer cells, and ectopic expression of
NF-kB can block anticancer drug-induced apoptosis (27–30).

Cell cultures
Ovarian cancer cells, including SKOV3, OVCAR3, and A2780
cells, were originally purchased from American Type Culture
Collection. The cell lines were authenticated by morphology,
growth characteristics, and DNA ﬁngerprinting. The short
tandem repeat DNA proﬁling was performed using the
AmplFLSTR Identiﬁler PCR Ampliﬁcation Kit at Korean Cell
Line Bank. Paclitaxel-resistant ovarian cancer cell lines
(SKOV3TR and OVCAR3TR) were generated by selecting the
viable SKOV3 and OVCAR3 cells 3 months after exposure to
paclitaxel (0.25–0.5 mmol/L). Cells were cultured in RPMI-1640
supplemented with 5% FBS, penicillin (100 U/mL), and streptomycin sulfate (100 mg/mL; Life Technologies). Paclitaxel,
MG132, and Bay 11-7082 were dissolved in DMSO. Further
dilutions were performed in cell culture media. DMSO was
used as a vehicle control throughout the study.
Gene expression and patient data
Patients in the Cambridge Translational Cancer Research
Ovarian Study 01(CTCR–OV01) had been recruited from 2002
to 2004 and had histologically conﬁrmed advanced (stages III

www.aacrjournals.org

and IV) epithelial ovarian cancer. All tissues had been biopsied
before start of neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Patients had been
randomly assigned to undergo either three cycles of carboplatin (AUC 7) or paclitaxel (175 mg/m2). Treatment response had
been estimated using serum CA125 levels after three cycles of
single-agent treatment. Treatment-sensitive patients were
deﬁned as those experienced more than a 50% decrease in
serum CA125 levels (5). The gene expression data from biopsies
was generated by using Affymetrix GeneChip human genome
U133A 2.0 platform and available from the National Center for
Biotechnology Information Gene Expression Omnibus database
(http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo; accession ID, GSE15622).
Animal xenograft studies
Five- to 6-week-old female BALB/c athymic nude mice (Orient-Bio Inc.) were inoculated subcutaneously with OVCAR3 cells
(1  106) resuspended in Matrigel (BD Biosciences). When the
tumors reached 80 to 100 mm3 in volume (approximately 14
days), the animals were randomly divided into four groups
consisting of at least three mice per group (day 0). Intratumoral
administration of RSF1 short hairpin RNA (shRNA; 10 mg/kg) or
control shRNA (10 mg/kg) was followed by intraperitoneal
injections of paclitaxel (10 mg/kg) or same volume of vehicle.
shRNA and paclitaxel were injected everyday for 14 days. The
length and width of the tumor mass as well as the mouse
weight were measured every 3 days and tumor volume was
calculated with the equation 1=2 ðlength  width2 Þ. At the
end of the experiment the animal were sacriﬁced, and the
tumor weights (g) were measured. Animal treatment and
maintenance were conducted in accordance with guidelines
approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee of Kyung
Hee University (Seoul, South Korea).
RSF1 inducible cell clones
The full-length RSF1 tagged with a V5 epitope tag at the
COOH-terminal was cloned into the Tet-off expression vector,
pTRE-hygro (Clontech). Parental SKOV3 cells were ﬁrst transfected with a tetracycline-controlled transactivator (tTA)
expression vector, and the tTA stable clones were selected by
G418 (300 mg/mL). The inducible RSF1 vector was then introduced into the SKOV3–tTA cells. Stable transfectants were
selected in 150 mg/mL hygromycin and then subsequently
maintained in culture medium containing 300 mg/mL G418,
150 mg/mL hygromycin, and 2 mg/mL doxycycline.
Cytotoxicity test
Cytotoxicity was estimated using the MTT assay. Cells were
seeded in 96-well plates at a density of 5  103 cells per well and
incubated for 24 hours. To examine the growth inhibitory effect
of paclitaxel, cells were treated with paclitaxel for 48 hours. The
optical density at 540 nm was determined using a microplate
spectrophotometer (Molecular Devices) to determine the cell
viability.
RNA isolation and real-time RT-PCR
Total RNA was prepared using Easy Blue kits (Intron Biotechnology), according to the manufacturer's instructions.
Total RNA (1 mg) was reverse transcribed into ﬁrst-strand

cDNA (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) following the manufacturer's procedure. The synthesized cDNA was used as a
template for PCR ampliﬁcation. Real-time PCR was performed
using a Thermal Cycler Dice Real Time PCR System (Takara Bio
Inc.). The primers used for SYBR Green real-time reverse
transcription (RT)-PCR were listed in Supplementary Table

the mean Ct of a control gene, GAPDH.

proteins were eluted with 30 mL of SDS–PAGE sample buffer
and boiled for 10 minutes. The eluted proteins were electrophoresed by 10% SDS–PAGE, transferred to PVDF membranes,
and probed with anti-RSF1, CBP, NF-kB p65 subunit, and
hSNF2H antibodies. The signals were visualized using an ECL
chemiluminescent system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech).
Following three washes in TBS-T, immunopositive bands were
visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence and exposed to
Image Quant LAS-4000 (GE Healthcare Life Sciences).

Western blot analysis
The cells were washed with ice-cold PBS and extracted in
protein lysis buffer (Intron Biotechnology). The protein concentration was determined by the Bradford assay. The cell
lysates were mixed with an equal volume of 5 SDS sample
buffer, boiled for 4 minutes and then separated on 10% to 12%
SDS–PAGE. After electrophoresis, the proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene diﬂuoride (PVDF) membranes. The
membrane was immunoblotted using speciﬁc primary antibodies at 4 C overnight. After washing, the signals were
detected with horseradish peroxidase–conjugated secondary
antibody for 1 hour and visualized using the ECL chemiluminescent system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Following
three washes in TBS-T, immunopositive bands were visualized
by enhanced chemiluminescence and exposed to Image Quant
LAS-4000 (GE Healthcare Life Sciences).

Chromatin immunoprecipitation assay
Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) was performed
using a ChIP Assay Kit, according to the manufacturer's
protocol (Upstate). Chromatin solutions were precipitated
using anti-p65 for 12 to 16 hours at 4 C. Antibody–protein
complexes were isolated by immunoprecipitation with blocked
protein A agarose and washed extensively. DNA was extracted
with phenol/chloroform, precipitated with ethanol and analyzed by PCR. The immunoprecipitated sample DNA was
compared with the input DNA. The primers used to amplify
a distinct region of the PTGS2 (COX2) promoter with putative
NF-kB–binding sites were 50 -CGA TGC TAA ACG ACG TCA
CAT TGT GCA-30 and 50 -CTC CAG AGC AGA ATG AGC TAC
AGA CAT-30 . The primers used to amplify a distinct region of
the XIAP promoter were 50 -CCC ATG CAC ACT TCC CAA CT-30
and 50 -TTC TCC CCC ATG GAT GTC CCA T-30 . PCRs were
performed for 25 to 30 cycles using a standard protocol. The
ampliﬁed products were subjected to 2% agarose gel electrophoresis and visualized by ethidium bromide staining and UV
irradiation.

Gene knockdown using siRNA and shRNA
Two shRNAs for RSF1 were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich
Co. hSNF2H-speciﬁc siRNAs and control siRNA were obtained
from Bioneer Technology. The cells were transfected with
shRNA or siRNA using lipofectamine (Invitrogen) according
to the manufacturer's suggested protocol. Brieﬂy, cells were
plated in 6-well culture dishes and allowed to attach and grow
for 24 hours before transfection. Each transfection mixture was
prepared by mixing the shRNA or siRNA with lipofectamine in
serum-free Opti-Modiﬁed Eagle Medium (Invitrogen). The
mixtures were incubated for 15 minutes at room temperature.
The transfection mixture was slowly added to the cells, which
were allowed to recover for an additional 24 hours before
experimental treatments.
Luciferase assay
The cells were transfected with the NF-kB–Luc reporter
plasmid (Clontech) using lipofectamine (Invitrogen) in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. Following incubation with the transfection reagent for 24 hours, cells were
lysed, and the luciferase activity was assessed using the dual
luciferase assay system (Promega) and luminometer (PerkinElmer Cetus).
Immunoprecipitation assay
Cells were lysed in a high-salt buffer. Equal amounts of
lysates were immunoprecipitated with 1 mg of the RSF1, NF-kB
p65, or CBP antibody and 30 mL of protein A agarose using
constant rotation overnight. Beads were washed with 10
mmol/L HEPES (pH 7.9), 1 mmol/L EDTA, 150 mmol/L NaCl,
and 1% Nonidet P-40 twice with 400 mL each. The precipitated

RSF1 expression and paclitaxel response in patients with
ovarian cancer and the mouse xenograft model
Through previous work, we determined that knockdown of
RSF1 sensitized ovarian cancer cells to paclitaxel, but not
carboplatin, and RSF1 was upregulated in paclitaxel-resistant
ovarian cancer cells and primary ovarian carcinoma tissues
(15). To further evaluate the clinical signiﬁcance of RSF1
expression for paclitaxel response, a correlation between
RSF1 expression and paclitaxel response was investigated in
patients with ovarian cancer and mouse xenograft models
(Fig. 1). We evaluated microarray expression data from a
prospective clinical trial (CTCR-OV01) in which patients were
randomized to paclitaxel monotherapy. Patients who showed
paclitaxel resistance had a signiﬁcantly higher expression of
RSF1 (P ¼ 0.02) compared with those who showed no paclitaxel
response (Fig. 1A). In addition, intratumoral administration of
RSF1 shRNA resulted in a signiﬁcant improvement in paclitaxel sensitivity in ovarian cancer xenograft-bearing mice
(Fig. 1B and Supplementary. Fig. S1). These data suggest that

increased levels of NF-kB–regulated genes in ovarian cancer
cells.

Enhanced expression of NF-kB–dependent genes in
paclitaxel-resistant ovarian cancer cells
To probe whether RSF1 expression is correlated with NFkB–dependent gene expression in ovarian cancer cells, we
performed Western blots on two groups of ovarian cancer cells,
parental cells (SKOV3 and OVCAR3) and their established
paclitaxel-resistant sublines (SKOV3TR and OVCAR3TR). As we
had previously reported, RSF1 protein levels were signiﬁcantly
higher in paclitaxel-resistant cells than their parental cells (15).
Importantly, RSF1-overexpressing paclitaxel-resistant cells
were found to express high levels of NF-kB–dependent genes
involved in the evasion of apoptosis (CFLAR, XIAP, BCL2, and
BCL2L1) and inﬂammation (PTGS2; Fig. 2A). In a parallel
experiment, real-time RT-PCR was used to determine whether
the increased expression of proteins from NF-kB–dependent
antiapoptotic and inﬂammatory genes was correlated with
levels of the corresponding mRNA (Fig. 2B). As with proteins,
the mRNA levels of NF-kB–dependent genes were higher in all
three of the RSF1-overexpressing paclitaxel-resistant sublines
compared with the respective parental cells. These results
suggest that elevated levels of RSF1, which is likely associated
with ovarian cancer paclitaxel resistance, is correlated with

RSF1 expression enhances NF-kB–dependent gene
expression in ovarian cancer cells
Next, we asked whether induction of RSF1 expression
enhanced the protein and mRNA levels of the antiapoptotic
and inﬂammatory genes we probed previously. We used Tet-off
RSF1 inducible SKOV3 ovarian cancer cells because they did
not harbor RSF1 ampliﬁcation or express a detectable level of
endogenous RSF1 (13). Western blot analysis of lysates from
these cells demonstrated that RSF1 protein was detected 12
and 24 hours after induction (Fig. 3A). Following induction of
RSF1 in these SKOV3 cells, elevated protein levels of NF-kB–
dependent genes were detected as well. RSF1 expression also
increased the mRNA expression of NF-kB–regulated genes
(Fig. 3B). To further investigate the role of RSF1 expression
in NF-kB–dependent genes regulation, we transfected
OVCAR3 cells with two independent shRNAs having satisfactory knockdown efﬁciency to reduce levels of RSF1.
OVCAR3 cells are known to harbor a high level of RSF1
ampliﬁcation and overexpression. As shown in Fig. 3C and D,
reduced RSF1 expression signiﬁcantly decreased the expression of inﬂammatory and antiapoptotic factors at both
protein and mRNA levels.

NF-kB activation by RSF1 is associated with paclitaxel
resistance in ovarian cancer
To investigate whether RSF1 regulates transcriptional
activity of NF-kB, we performed a luciferase assay using
an NF-kB response element–derived reporter (pNF-kB–
Luc). As shown in Fig. 4A, RSF1-induced cells showed
markedly increased luciferase activity compared with
RSF1-noninduced cells. In contrast, reducing RSF1 using
shRNAs led to a signiﬁcant decrease in the transcriptional
activity of NF-kB (Fig. 4B). However, we observed no signiﬁcant change in NF-kB mRNA levels after RSF1 induction
(Supplementary Fig. S2). Thus, these data suggest that RSF1
functions as a positive regulator for NF-kB transcriptional
activity.
Using NF-kB pathway inhibitors Bay 11-7082 and MG132, we
next investigated whether NF-kB activation by RSF1 is associated with RSF1-mediated paclitaxel resistance. Treating
RSF1-overexpressing OVCAR3 cells with the NF-kB inhibitor
before paclitaxel treatment was associated with a dramatic
increase of cell death (Fig. 4C). We also observed that RSF1
induction markedly inhibits SKOV3 cell death by paclitaxel, but
pretreating the cells with an NF-kB inhibitor signiﬁcantly
reduced the RSF1-induced paclitaxel resistance of the SKOV3
cells (Fig. 4D). Furthermore, to determine whether NF-kB–

2262

Cancer Res; 74(8) April 15, 2014

dependent genes are potentially involved in the paclitaxel
resistance of ovarian cancer cells, we investigated paclitaxelinduced cell death following transfection of siRNAs to knockdown XIAP, CFLAR, BCL2, BCL2L, PTGS2. As shown in Fig.
4E, the knockdown of any of the ﬁve genes led to a mild
increase in cytotoxic activity. In addition, simultaneous
targeting of the genes by selected siRNA combinations
showed enhanced cytotoxicity compared with the single
siRNA treatment. These data suggest that many of antiapoptotic and prosurvival genes regulated by the NF-kB
pathway may work together in RSF1-induced chemoresistance of ovarian cancer cells.
RSF1 interacts with NF-kB in chemoresistant ovarian
cancer cells
A previous study suggested that HBXAP colocalizes with NFkB in the nuclei of 293T cells (18). In this study, we examined
whether RSF1 and NF-kB interact with each other in ovarian
cancer cells using a coimmunoprecipitation assay. As shown
in Fig. 5A, inducing RSF1 expression increased the interaction
between NF-kB and RSF1. Interaction between RSF1 and NFkB was also observed in OVCAR3 cells overexpressing endogenous RSF1, but not in A2780 cells, which barely express RSF1.
An association between RSF1 and NF-kB was also apparent in a

addition, RSF1 was found to interact with CBP, which is a
ubiquitous coactivator for NF-kB in RSF1-induced SKOV3 and
OVCAR3 cells (Fig. 5C). Importantly, increased interaction

biologic signiﬁcance of the interaction in chemoresistant
ovarian cancer cells. We next performed a ChIP assay to further
conﬁrm the mechanism by which RSF1 regulates PTGS2 and
XIAP expression using transcriptional activation of NF-kB. As
shown in Fig. 6B, RSF1 binds to an NF-kB element in the PTGS2
and XIAP promoters of SKOV3TR cells. High binding of CBP to
an NF-kB element was also observed. These data indicate that
a RSF1 and CBP complex may increase PTGS2 and XIAP
transcription by enhancing NF-kB binding to the promoters
in chemoresistant ovarian cancer cells.
hSNF2H is involved in the interaction between RSF1 and
NF-kB in chemoresistant ovarian cancer cells
Previously, we showed that downregulation of hSNF2H or
disruption of the hSNF2H and RSF1 interaction enhanced
paclitaxel sensitivity in tumor cells with elevated RSF1 levels
(15). Thus, we investigated whether hSNF2H is associated with
the interaction between NF-kB and RSF1 in chemoresistant
ovarian cancer cells. A coimmunoprecipitation assay revealed
that NF-kB interacts with hSNF2H as well as CBP and RSF1 in
RSF1-induced SKOV3 and OVCAR3 cells (Fig. 7A). In addition,

suppressed the interaction between RSF1 and NF-kB in RSF1induced SKOV3 cells and paclitaxel-resistant SKOV3TR and
OVCAR3TR cells.

Discussion
Chemoresistance is the major clinical obstacle for the
treatment of patients with ovarian cancer, and a better
understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved in
this cellular protection is required to develop more successful therapies. Paclitaxel has been used as a front-line chemotherapeutic agent for several types of human cancer,
including ovarian cancer. However, the drug frequently
induces resistance, and the molecular mechanisms of resistance to paclitaxel remain poorly understood. Mounting
evidence indicates that PI3K/Akt and the NF-kB signaling
pathways are involved in development of cancer chemoresistance by regulating the expression of genes critical for cell
survival, thereby evading apoptosis (27–29). Indeed, paclitaxel has been demonstrated to induce constitutive NF-kB
activation and lead to chemoresistance in several human
cancer cells, including ovarian cancer (31–33).
Previously, we found that RSF1 was upregulated in paclitaxel-resistant ovarian cancer cell lines (15), and RSF1 immunoreactivity in primary ovarian carcinoma tissues correlated

with in vitro paclitaxel resistance. In addition, ectopic expression of RSF1 signiﬁcantly enhanced paclitaxel resistance of
ovarian cancer cells. Furthermore, cDNA microarray analysis
followed by interaction network analysis revealed that RSF1
altered expression of several genes and was associated with
several molecular hubs, including NF-kB, ERK (extracellular
signal–regulated kinase), and Akt. However, the precise molecular mechanisms of how RSF1 contributed to ovarian cancer
resistance remained poorly understood. Therefore, in our more
recent work described here, we focused on the pathways
regulated by RSF1 as a way to explore the potential mechanism
by which RSF1 induces chemoresistance. Among the molecular
hubs suggested by the previous ﬁnding (15), NF-kB has gained
more attention due to its importance in the regulation of
survival and antiapoptotic genes, which may contribute to
paclitaxel resistance. In addition, it is notable that HBXAP/
RSF1 has been shown to regulate the transcriptional activity of
NF-kB (17, 18). Therefore, it was reasonable to hypothesize that
inhibition of NF-kB or pathways regulated by NF-kB may be

potential targets of RSF1 in chemoresistant ovarian cancer
cells.
With recent advances in drug resistance, it has become
evident that defects in control of cell death and apoptosis are
strongly associated with chemoresistance (34, 35). The inhibitors of apoptosis proteins (IAP), including XIAP, suppress
apoptosis induced by both extrinsic and intrinsic pathways
through direct inhibition of effector caspases (caspases 3, 6, 7,
and 9), whereas the antiapoptotic members of the BCL2 family
antagonize the function of the proapoptotic members, such as
BAX. Indeed, upregulation of the antiapoptotic protein BCL2
and/or downregulation of proapoptotic BAX have been correlated with increased chemoresistance (36, 37). In addition,
inhibitors of caspases such as CFLAR (FLIP) and XIAP were
implicated as determinants of the chemosensitivity of ovarian
cancer (38, 39). NF-kB induces expression of some antiapoptotic BCL2 family proteins such as BCL2 and BCL2L1 (BCLX) as
well as inhibitors of caspases like CFLAR (FLIP) and XIAP
(40, 41). In the present study, we found a strong correlation

Involvement of NF-kB in RSF1-Induced Chemoresistance

CBP-speciﬁc antibodies. Lane 1, immunoprecipitation with indicated antibody in RSF1-noninduced SKOV3 cells; lane 2, immunoprecipitation with

between high levels of RSF1 in ovarian cancer and increased
expression of NF-kB–dependent genes involved in evasion of
apoptosis (CFLAR, XIAP, BCL2, and BCL2L1) and inﬂammation
(PTGS2). In addition, we found that RSF1 stimulates the
transcriptional activity of NF-kB but not mRNA expression
of the NF-kB. These data suggest that RSF1 induces survival
and antiapoptotic gene expression by regulating the transcriptional activity of NF-kB in ovarian cancer cells. Details of the
molecular mechanism through which RSF1 regulates this
transcriptional activity are poorly understood. Huang and
colleagues suggested that HBXAP regulates NF-kB–mediated
gene activation in normal 293T cells by inﬂuencing the DNA
binding activity of NF-kB (18). Additional studies are needed to
examine whether RSF1 increases the transcriptional activity of
NF-kB by enhancing DNA binding of NF-kB in chemoresistant
ovarian cancer cells.
Our observation that RSF1 can stimulate the transcriptional
activity of NF-kB is in agreement with other ﬁndings that

HBXAP/RSF1, both alone and in the presence of HBX, increases
NF-kB transcription in human liver cancer HepG2 cells (17). In
this study, we further tested the hypothesis that RSF-driven
increases in NF-kB–mediated gene expression might confer
paclitaxel resistance in ovarian cancer. Inhibition of the NF-kB
pathway using NF-kB inhibitors and siRNA of NF-kB–dependent genes signiﬁcantly increased paclitaxel sensitivity of
RSF1-overexpressing OVCAR3 cells and/or RSF1-induced
SKOV3 cells. These data suggest that involvement of the
NF-kB pathway in RSF1-induced paclitaxel resistance in ovarian cancer cells. Furthermore, coimmunoprecipitation assays
revealed interaction of RSF1 with NF-kB in RSF1-overexpressing ovarian cancer cells and paclitaxel-resistant cells.
Although RSF1 has been classiﬁed as a transcriptional
activator in HepG2 liver cancer (17) and in ovarian cancer
cells (on the basis of this work presented here), it is noteworthy
that HBXAP/RSF1 also acts as a transcriptional repressor for
NF-kB under different conditions. For example, upon TNF-a

stimulation, HBXAP/RSF1 alone repressed the TNF-a–induced
transcription activity of NF-kB in HepG2 cells, whereas HBXAP
became a super coactivator in the presence of HBX (17). In
human embryonic kidney 293T (HEK293T) cells, HBXAP/RSF1
repressed the transcriptional activity of NF-kB both in the
absence and presence of TNF-a stimulation (17, 18). These
observations indicate that HBXAP/RSF1 acts as either a transcriptional activator or repressor depending on the cell type
and/or the interactions with a transcription coactivator/mediator such as HBX. In this regard, we speculated that RSF1 may
interact with other transcription coactivators to stimulate NFkB transcription in ovarian cancer cells. NF-kB–dependent
gene expression involves a growing family of proteins termed
transcriptional coactivators, which most likely function by
facilitating or bridging the sequence-speciﬁc activators to the
basal transcriptional machinery and altering chromatin structure. In the work described here, we found that RSF1 interacts
with NF-kB and its ubiquitous coactivator CBP. It is generally
accepted that the p65 component of NF-kB binds to the
coactivator CBP and its structural homolog p300, resulting in
enhanced transactivation (42, 43). For example, phosphorylation of p65 by protein kinase A stimulates NF-kB–dependent
gene expression by enhancing the interaction of p65 with CBP
(44). Interestingly, a possible role for CBP in chemoresistance
has been reported. p300-regulated b-catenin signaling and NFkB–speciﬁc transcriptional activity have been reported to
induce ABCB1(MDR1) and BCL2L1 gene expression, which
facilitate chemoresistance in breast tumor cells (45). In addition, inhibition of CBP/catenin interactions leads to eradication of drug-resistant primary leukemia in combination with
conventional therapy (46). Overexpression of the CBP/p300interacting transactivator (CITED2) in cisplatin-resistant ovar-

2266

Cancer Res; 74(8) April 15, 2014

ian cancer cells has also been reported (47). Hypoxia-induced
tumor growth and resistance can be repressed by disrupting
the interaction between HIF1a and the p300/CBP coactivator
(48). In this study, no signiﬁcant differences in CBP expression
were observed between drug-resistant and parental cells (Supplementary Fig. S3). However, we demonstrated that RSF1
interacts with the ubiquitous NF-kB coactivator CBP as well as
NF-kB. In addition, ChIP assays revealed that RSF1 and CBP are
located on the consensus NF-kB binding element in the XIAP
and PTGS2 promoters with NF-kB in chemoresistant ovarian
cancer cells. These observations indicate that RSF1 might act as a
bridging factor that facilitates an interaction among NF-kB, CBP,
and a basal transcriptional complex, which, therefore, regulates
NF-kB–mediated antiapoptotic protein gene expression and
results in chemoresistance of ovarian cancer cells. Further
experimentation is required to conﬁrm this hypothesis.
The RSF1 protein partners with hSNF2H, also known as
SMARCA5, to form an ISWI (imitation switch) chromatin
remodeling complex (13). In this complex, RSF1 is known to
function as a histone chaperone to modulate DNA binding
activity of the RSF complex, whereas hSNF2H possesses nucleosome-dependent ATPase and helicase activities for DNA
unwinding. In previous studies, we demonstrated that hSNF2H
plays a role in the protumor functions of RSF1 in ovarian
cancer cells. hSNF2H knockdown had little effect on paclitaxel
response in the control SKOV3 cells that have a very low level of
endogenous RSF1 expression (15). However, downregulation of
hSNF2H or disruption of the hSNF2H and RSF1 interaction
enhanced paclitaxel sensitivity of tumor cells with RSF1 upregulation (15). These data suggest that hSNF2H may play a role
in paclitaxel resistance probably via the interaction with RSF1.
In this regard, we have investigated whether hSNF2H is

cells. Knockdown studies using hSNF2H siRNA revealed that
hSNF2H was only partially involved in the interaction between
RSF1 and NF-kB.
In summary, we have shown that RSF1 contributes to
paclitaxel resistance of ovarian cancer. RSF1 may function as
a coactivator for NF-kB, consequently augmenting expression
of genes necessary for the development of chemoresistance.
Furthermore, for the ﬁrst time, this study suggested a
molecular mechanism for RSF1-induced ovarian cancer
chemoresistance.
