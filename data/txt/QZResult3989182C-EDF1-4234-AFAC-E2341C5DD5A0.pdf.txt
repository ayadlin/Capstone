Abstract
AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), a biologic sensor for cellular energy status, has been shown to act
upstream and downstream of known tumor suppressors. However, whether AMPK itself plays a tumor
suppressor role in cancer remains unclear. Here, we found that the a2 catalytic subunit isoform of AMPK is
signiﬁcantly downregulated in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Clinicopathologic analysis revealed that
underexpression of AMPK-a2 was statistically associated with an undifferentiated cellular phenotype and
poor patient prognosis. Loss of AMPK-a2 in HCC cells rendered them more tumorigenic than control cells
both in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, ectopic expression of AMPK enhanced the acetylation and stability
of p53 in HCC cells. The p53 deacetylase, SIRT1, was phosphorylated and inactivated by AMPK at Thr344,
promoting p53 acetylation and apoptosis of HCC cells. Taken together, our ﬁndings suggest that underexpression of AMPK is frequently observed in HCC, and that inactivation of AMPK promotes hepatocarcinogenesis by destabilizing p53 in a SIRT1-dependent manner.

Introduction
AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), which functions as a
cellular energy sensor, occurs as heterotrimers composed of a,
b, and g subunits. The a-subunit serves as the catalytic subunit,
whereas the b- and g-subunits serve regulatory functions (1, 2).
As its name implies, AMPK is activated by increases in the
cellular AMP:ATP and ADP:ATP ratio caused by conditions of
metabolic stress, including hypoxia and nutrition depletion.
Recently, AMPK has been implicated in carcinogenesis
because of the ﬁnding that a well-known tumor suppressor,
LKB1, is an upstream activating kinase for AMPK (3, 4).
Furthermore, activation of AMPK was shown to induce a
p53-dependent G1 cell-cycle arrest, suggesting that AMPK
possesses tumor suppressor activity (5).
SIRT1 is an NAD-dependent protein deacetylase, originally
discovered in yeast, involved in gene silencing, telomere regulation, and extension of lifespan following caloric restriction
(6). It is predominantly localized in the nucleus, and deacetylates both histone and nonhistone proteins, such as p53,
FOXOs, and Ku70 (7). SIRT1 deacetylates p53 and inhibits

p53-mediated cell death following DNA damage, and SIRT1deﬁcient mice exhibit p53 hyperacetylation following DNA
damage (8). All of these observations suggest that SIRT1 is a
negative regulator of p53.
In the present study, we explored the role of AMPK in the
pathogenesis of hepatocelluar carcinoma (HCC). Using quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR), we found that the AMPK-a2
subunit was frequently underexpressed in human HCCs. Functional analysis showed that stable knockdown of AMPK-a2 in
HCC cells increased their tumorigenicity. Given loss of AMPK
induces HCCs, we observed that AMPK enhanced acetylation
of p53 through phosphorylation and inhibition of SIRT1 in HCC
cells, resulting in promotion of apoptosis. Thus, our study
provides new evidence for the tumor suppressor role of AMPK,
and suggests that activation of AMPK may present a potential
therapeutic target in HCC.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture and transfection
The human hepatoma cell lines, HepG2 and PLC/PRF/5,
were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection.
Human HCC cell line SMMC-7721 was a gift from the Shanghai
Institute of Biochemistry and Cell Biology, Chinese Academy of
Sciences (Beijing, China). Cells were maintained in Dulbecco's
Modiﬁed Eagle's Medium (DMEM) high-glucose medium (Life
Technologies) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated FBS
(JRH Biosciences) and 1 mmol/L sodium pyruvate. Cells were
transfected with DNA constructs using Lipofectamine 2000
(Invitrogen) according to manufacturer's protocol. For establishment of stable clones, PLC/PRF/5 cells were transfected
with shAMPK-a2 expression constructs, and were selected
with the antibiotic G418 (0.8 mg/mL) 48 hours after
transfection.

AMPK Inactivates SIRT1 to Stabilize p53

Annexin V apoptosis detection assay
Annexin V labeling was conducted with BD Pharmingen
Annexin V:PE Apoptosis Detection Kit I according to the
manufacturer's protocol. Cells were transfected with GFPtagged SIRT1 mutants and ﬂuorescein isothiocynate-positive
cells were gated for Annexin V/7-AAD labeling.

AMPK kinase assay
Kinase assays were conducted as described (9). The GSTAMPK catalytic domain was incubated with His-SIRT1 in
the AMPK kinase buffer (50 mmol/L HEPES, 0.02% BRIJ35,
pH7.0) in the presence of 10 mCi [g-32P] ATP. Proteins were
resolved by SDS-PAGE and radioactive signal visualized by
autoradiography.

Results
In vitro deacetylase activity assay
GST-p53 was acetylated in the presence of puriﬁed p300
protein (Enzo Life Science) and acetyl-CoA in acetylation
buffer [50 mmol/L HEPES pH 7.9, 1 mmol/L EDTA, 50 mg/mL
bovine serum albumin (BSA)]. The acetylated p53 was subjected to SIRT1 deacetylation in deacetylation buffer (50
mmol/L Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 137 mmol/L NaCl, 2.7 mmol/L KCl,
1 mmol/L MgCl2, and 1 mg/mL BSA), supplemented with 10
mmol/L NADþ (Sigma). Proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE,
and the level of p53 acetylation was visualized by probing with
anti-acetyl-p53(K382) antibody.

Underexpression of AMPK-a2 transcripts in HCC
To address the signiﬁcance of AMPK in human HCCs, we
examined the mRNA expression levels of the AMPK catalytic
subunit isoform, AMPK-a2, in HCCs using (qRT-PCR). We were
interested in AMPK-a2 because the allelic region of AMPK-a2,
that is chromosome region 1p31, has previously been reported to
be deleted in HCC (10, 11). Our results indicate that AMPK-a2 was
frequently underexpressed in HCCs (mean decrease 47.6%, 20 of
42 cases; P < 0.001) as compared with their corresponding
nontumorous livers (Fig. 1A). The reduced expression of
AMPK-a2 protein was conﬁrmed in some of the HCC samples
by Western blotting (Supplementary Fig. S1). In line with this
observation, at least 5 out of 9 HCC cell lines examined (Fig. 1B),
including SMMC-7721, Hep3B, HepG2, CL48, and Huh-7 cells,
had low expression of AMPK-a2 detected by Western blotting
suggesting that downregulation of AMPK is a frequent event in
HCC tissues and cell lines. To understand the signiﬁcance of
underexpression of AMPK-a2 in human HCC, we conducted
statistical analysis of the association of clinicopathologic

features with underexpression of AMPK-a2. This showed that
underexpression of AMPK-a2 (T/NT < 0.5) was signiﬁcantly
correlated with a poorer tumor differentiation classiﬁed
according to Edmonson grading (Table 1) and a poorer disease-free survival rate (Fig. 1C), indicating that underexpression of AMPK-a2 was associated with a poor prognosis for
patients with HCC.

DNA methylation and histone deacetylation are 2 major
epigenetic mechanisms that lead to gene silencing in cancer.
To investigate whether underexpression of AMPK-a2 is due to
epigenetic regulation, the HCC cell line HepG2, which shows no
detectable AMPK-a2 mRNA or protein, was treated with the
DNA methylation inhibitor, 5-aza-20 -deoxycytidine (5-Aza), or
the histone deacetylase inhibitor, trichostatin A (TSA). As
shown in Fig. 1D (i), treatment with TSA, but not 5-Aza,
signiﬁcantly induced the reexpression of AMPK-a2 transcripts,
indicating that the a2 promoter was repressed by histone
acetylation. To further conﬁrm the role of histone modiﬁcation
on AMPK-a2 expression, we conducted chromatin immunoprecipitation assays using anti-acetylated histone antibody.
HepG2 cells pretreated with TSA showed a large increase in
DNA fragments containing the AMPK-a2 promoter after
immunoprecipitation using anti-acetylated histone antibody,
as compared with unrelated antibody (anti-myc) control [Fig.
1D (ii)]. Collectively, these data suggested that an alteration of
histone acetylation might occur at the promoter region of
AMPK-a2, leading to its underexpression in human HCCs.
AMPK inhibited HCC cell growth
To explore whether AMPK is involved in HCC cell growth, we
treated HCC cell lines with various AMPK activators, such as
resveratrol, metformin, and phenformin, and conducted cell
proliferation and colony formation assays. As shown in Fig. 2A
and B, incubation of these AMPK activators with PLC/PRF/5
and HepG2 (Supplementary Fig. S2) cells suppressed cell
proliferation and colony formation in a dose-dependent manner. To rule out off-target effects of these pharmacologic
activators, DNA encoding AMPK-a2 was also transfected into
HepG2 cells and colony formation assays conducted. As
expected, HepG2 cells expressing AMPK-a2 formed far fewer
colonies than cells transfected with the empty vector or an
unrelated control gene (chloramphenicol acetyl transferase,
CAT), indicating that forced expression of AMPK-a2 suppressed the growth of HepG2 cells (Fig. 2C). To further characterize the tumor suppressor effects of AMPK-a2, the endogenous a2 in PLC/PRF/5 cells (which have a high AMPK-a2
expression level) was speciﬁcally knocked down using shorthairpin RNA (shRNA). Two stable clones (shAMPK#1 and
shAMPK#2) were isolated and the knockdown of AMPK-a2
conﬁrmed by immunoblotting (Fig. 2D). Consistently, the
proliferation rates of these stable knockdown clones were
signiﬁcantly higher than those of the vector control, and were
highest for shAMPK#2 cells, which have a greater degree of
knockdown of expression than shAMPK#1 cells. To assess
anchorage-independent growth and in vivo tumor growth of
the stable clones, we conducted assays of growth of cells in soft
agar and of xenografts in nude mice. Our data show that the 2
stable knockdown clones formed signiﬁcantly more, and larger, colonies than the vector control cells in the soft agar growth
assay (Fig. 2E) and that tumors generated from the stable
knockdown clone (shAMPK#1) exhibited a signiﬁcant
enhancement in the onset of tumor formation, faster growth
rates, and higher weights than those from the vector control
cells (Fig. 2F) suggesting that loss of expression of AMPK-a2
promoted tumor growth in vivo.

AMPK promoted the acetylation of p53
As the pharmacologic AMPK activator 5-aminoimidazole-4carboxamide-1-b-4-ribofuranoside (AICAR) has been reported
to regulate the cell cycle through the stabilization of p53 (5), we
wondered whether AMPK might regulate p53 to modulate
hepatocarcinogenesis. To explore the potential role of AMPK

GFP fused to an activated AMPK-a2 mutant (T172D) and the
phosphorylation of Ser20 and acetylation of Lys382 on p53 was
analyzed. Interestingly, overexpression of AMPK-a2 signiﬁcantly enhanced both Ser20 phosphorylation and acetylation

of p53 in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 3A). Previous studies
have suggested that AMPK regulates p53 by promoting the
phosphorylation at the Ser15 site. Thus, in vitro kinase assays
were conducted to evaluate whether AMPK directly phosphorylated p53. A glutathione S-transferase (GST fusion) of the
catalytic domain of AMPK-a2 [amino acids (a.a.) 1–312, GSTAMPK-CA) was used to phosphorylate wild-type p53 and
mutant versions in which Ser15 or Ser20 was mutated to
alanine (S15A and S20A mutants). As shown in Fig. 3B, AMPK
directly phosphorylated wild-type, S15A and S20A mutants of
p53 to a similar extent suggesting that while p53 is a substrate
of AMPK, Ser15 and Ser20 may not be direct phosphorylation
sites for AMPK.

acetylated p53; however, treatment with A769662 partially
reversed the effect of SIRT1 on p53 acetylation, in a dosedependent manner (Fig. 3C). To further conﬁrm that AMPK
blocks the SIRT1-mediated deacetylation of p53, a p53-dependent luciferase reporter assay was conducted by cotransfecting
SIRT1 with increasing amounts of constructs expressing the
activated form of AMPK-a2 (T172D). This showed that ectopic
expression of SIRT1 suppressed p53 transcriptional activity,
but also that expression of activated AMPKa2 inhibited the
suppressive effect of SIRT1 on p53 transcriptional activity (Fig.
3D). Taken together, these data support the hypothesis that
AMPK suppresses the deacetylase activity of SIRT1 to promote
p53 transcriptional activity.

AMPK suppressed SIRT1 deacetylase activity on p53
To investigate how AMPK promotes the acetylation of p53,
the potential regulation of the p53 deacetylase, SIRT1, by
AMPK was examined (12). HepG2 cells were cotransfected
with Myc-p53 and Flag-SIRT1 constructs, followed by activating AMPK using the selective AMPK activator, A769662. Coexpression of SIRT1 with p53 dramatically reduced the level of

AMPK directly binds to the deacetylase domain of SIRT1
To elucidate the mechanism by which AMPK inhibits SIRT1,
we examined the interaction of these 2 proteins using a
coimmunoprecipitation assay. As shown in Fig. 4A, GFPAMPK-a2, but not GFP alone, coprecipitated with Flag-SIRT1
in HEK293T cells cotransfected with DNAs encoding GFPAMPK-a2 and Flag-SIRT1. In addition, the interaction of

contains a threonine residue (Thr344) surrounded by a
sequence, which has a close similarity to a consensus AMPK
recognition site (refs. 13–15; although with aspartate at the
Pþ4 position rather than the preferred hydrophobic
residue; Fig. 5B). To conﬁrm phosphorylation of SIRT1 at this
threonine, Thr344 was mutated to alanine and the mutant used
in a cell-free kinase assay. While both the GST-AMPK-CAD and
heterotrimeric forms of AMPK robustly phosphorylated the
M2 mutant of SIRT1, this phosphorylation was completely
abolished with a T344A substitution in M2 (Fig. 5C). Consistently, a signiﬁcant reduction of SIRT1 phosphorylation by
GST-AMPK-CAD was also observed in a full-length SIRT1
carrying the T344A substitution (Fig. 5D). To test whether this
phosphorylation also occurs in intact cells, HEK293T cells
were transfected with DNAs encoding wild-type or a T344A
mutant of Flag-SIRT1, and treated with A769662. After immunoprecipitation of Flag-SIRT1, threonine phosphorylation was
determined. Treatment with A769662 signiﬁcantly increased
AMPK activity and enhanced the threonine phosphorylation
of wild-type SIRT1, but any effect with the T344A mutant was
not statistically signiﬁcant (Fig. 5E), implying that AMPK
activation induces the phosphorylation of SIRT1 primarily at
Thr344.

AMPK-a2 and SIRT1 was further conﬁrmed using a GSTafﬁnity pull-down assay, in which His-SIRT1 was pulled down
with GST-AMPK-CA (Fig. 4B) suggesting that these 2 proteins
interact in intact cells. Using confocal immunoﬂuorescence
staining, colocalization of SIRT1 and AMPK-a2 was observed
in the nuclei of HepG2 cells (Fig. 4C). To map the region of
SIRT1 that interacts with the AMPK-a2 kinase domain, 3
truncation mutants, that is, M1 (1–235), M2 (236–525), and
M3 (526–747) of SIRT1 were generated. Using the GST afﬁnity
pull-down assay, we showed that only the mutant M2, but not
M1 and M3, bound to GST-AMPK-CA (Fig. 4D), indicating that
the kinase domain of AMPK-a2 directly interacts with the
deacetylase domain of SIRT1.
AMPK phosphorylated SIRT1 at Thr344
Because AMPK is a serine/threonine kinase, we next tested
whether AMPK phosphorylates SIRT1 directly. In vitro kinase
assays were conducted using a puriﬁed GST fusion with the
activated AMPK-a2 catalytic domain (a.a.1–312 T172D, GSTAMPK-CAD) and full-length His-SIRT1. The result showed that
GST-AMPK-CAD phosphorylated SIRT1, but not another
member of the sirtuin family, SIRT2 (Fig. 5A). As a positive
control, we showed that GST-AMPK-CAD also phosphorylated
a known substrate (13), the catalytic domain of 3-hydroxy-3methyl-glutaryl coA reductase (HMG-CoA reductase; Fig. 5A).
Moreover, the region of SIRT1 phosphorylated by AMPK was
mapped to the M2 truncation mutant of SIRT1 (Fig. 5A). To
further delineate the AMPK phosphorylation site on SIRT1, the
amino acid sequence of the catalytic domain of SIRT1 was
compared with other known AMPK consensus phosphorylation sequences revealing that the catalytic domain of SIRT1

subcellular localization. On the other hand, previous structural studies have shown that amino acid residues 344–348
of SIRT1 are highly conserved among different species and
are involved in the binding of acetyl-p53 (16). Thus, we
hypothesized that the phosphorylation at Thr344 may abolish the interaction between SIRT1 and acetyl-p53. GSTafﬁnity pull-down assays were conducted using GST-p53 or
preacetylated GST-p53 to precipitate the wild-type, T344A,
or T344E mutants of SIRT1. As shown in Fig. 6C, both wildtype and T344A SIRT1, but not the T344E mutant, bound
strongly to acetylated p53, implying that the phosphorylation of SIRT1 at Thr344 abrogates the binding of SIRT1 to
acetylated p53. Thus, our results suggest that phosphorylation of T344 leads to a loss of SIRT1 deacetylase activity
towards p53 by attenuating the afﬁnity of SIRT1 for its
substrate p53.
Phosphorylation of SIRT1 at Thr344 inhibited
suppression of the transcriptional activity of p53
Because the phosphorylation of SIRT1 at T344 position
affects the afﬁnity of substrate binding, the effect of this
phosphorylation on p53 transcriptional activity was assessed
using p53 luciferase reporter assays. While wild-type and T344A
mutant SIRT1 was found to signiﬁcantly suppress p53 transcriptional activity in a dose-dependent manner; this suppression was abolished with the phosphomimetic T344E mutant
and the catalytic inactive H363Y mutant of SIRT1 (Fig. 6D).
Similar results were also observed in another HCC cell line,
SMMC-7721 (Supplementary Fig. S4B), suggesting that phosphorylation at Thr344 causes SIRT1 to lose its ability to suppress p53 activity. This was further supported by the observation that the T344E mutant had lost its ability to suppress the
transcription of target genes downstream of p53, including
p21CIP and Bax, upon etoposide treatment (Fig. 6E).
Thr344 phosphorylation of SIRT1 promoted apoptosis of
HCC cells
Because phosphorylation of SIRT1 at Thr344 enhances the
expression of p53 target genes, we analyzed whether the
effect on SIRT1 phosphorylation affects apoptosis of HCC
cells. SMMC-7721 cells were transfected with GFP-tagged
SIRT1 wild-type or mutant constructs, and apoptosis was
assessed using ﬂuorescence-activated cell sorting analysis.
GFP-positive cells were gated and counted for the apoptotic
cells that were Annexin V/7-AAD dual positive. As shown
in Fig. 6F, transfection with wild-type or T344A mutant
SIRT1 signiﬁcantly reduced etoposide-induced apoptosis
compared with the GFP control, whereas transfection with
the T344E mutant failed to rescue the etoposide-induced
apoptosis, showing that the T344E substitution prevented
the antiapoptotic effect of SIRT1. We next examined the
effect of the T344E mutant on HCC cell growth using a
colony formation assay. Forced expression of H363Y and
T344E mutants, but not the wild-type and T344A mutant, of
SIRT1 signiﬁcantly reduced the number of colonies formed
when compared with a vector control in HepG2 cells (Fig.
6G), indicating that T344E mutant suppressed HCC cell
growth. Taken together, these results show that phosphor-

ylation of Thr344 abolishes the antiapoptotic activity of
SIRT1 (Fig. 6H).

Discussion
As a downstream target of the tumor suppressor LKB1,
the role of AMPK in cancer is being extensively researched. The
LKB1-AMPK axis has been shown to be important in the
suppression of the mTOR signaling pathway, which regulates
cell proliferation and is hyperactivated in the majority
of solid tumors (17). However, the activation of AMPK in
LKB1-null non–small cell lung cancer cells can also induce
apoptosis, suggesting that alternative pathways can be
involved in the tumor suppressor effects of AMPK, independent of LKB1 (18). In this study, we explored the involvement
of AMPK in HCC development. Our results indicate that
AMPK is a potential tumor suppressor in human HCCs based
on 3 lines of evidence. First, AMPK-a2 transcripts, encoding
one of the catalytic subunit isoforms of AMPK, were signiﬁcantly downregulated in HCCs compared with corresponding
nontumorous liver tissue (Fig. 1A) and underexpression of
AMPK-a2 correlated with a poorer prognosis for the patients
(Fig. 1C and Table 1). Second, treatment with pharmacologic
activators of AMPK led to a dose-dependent inhibition of
cell proliferation (Fig. 2A) and colony formation (Fig. 2B) with
HCC cells indicating that activation of AMPK inhibits HCC
cell growth. Third, using HCC cells lines with stable knockdown of AMPK-a2, we showed that loss of AMPK-a2 enhanced
the tumorigenicity of HCC cells addressed by colony formation (Fig. 2C), cell proliferation (Fig. 2D), growth in soft agar
(Fig. 2E), or xenografts in nude mice (Fig. 2F). Thus, these data
strongly support the notion that AMPK-a2 is a tumor suppressor in HCC. As to how AMPK-a2 expression is downregulated in HCCs, we speculated that AMPK-a2 expression
may be repressed by promoter methylation, because a CpG
island was found in the promoter region of AMPK-a2 when
analysed using the software EMBOSS CpGPlot. Surprisingly,
however, our results indicate that treatment with a histone
deacetylase inhibitor, TSA, but not 5-Aza, restored the expression of AMPK-a2 in HCC cell lines expressing low levels of
endogenous AMPK-a2 (Fig. 1C and D). This suggests that the
AMPK-a2 promoter was suppressed by histone acetylation
rather than DNA methylation in HCC cells.
Activation of AMPK by AICAR has been shown to induce
cell-cycle arrest through the activation of the p53-p21 pathway
(5, 19). Furthermore, activation of AMPK is associated with the
phosphorylation of p53 at Ser15 and Ser20, which is coupled to
the acetylation of p53 at Lys382 (19, 20). Consistent with these
reports, we showed that overexpression of AMPK promoted
Ser20 phosphorylation and Lys382 acetylation of p53 (Fig. 3A).
However, our data suggested that AMPK did not directly
phosphorylate the Ser15 or Ser20 sites on p53 (Fig. 3B). One
possibility to explain this apparent discrepancy is that our
investigation was carried out using a direct in vitro kinase
assays, whereas previous studies were conducted in transfected cells; in the intact cells these sites on p53 might be
phosphorylated by another kinase downstream of AMPK. It is
worth noting that the sequences around Ser15 or Ser20 do not

AMPK Inactivates SIRT1 to Stabilize p53

match the previously identiﬁed consensus recognition motifs
for AMPK (14, 15).
Previous reports have shown that p53 is acetylated by
p300/CBP at Lys382 (21) and is deacetylated by histone
deacetylases (22). In this study, we showed that AMPK
promoted the acetylation of p53 by inactivating the class
III histone deacetylase SIRT1 by phosphorylation. We
showed that AMPK directly phosphorylated SIRT1 at a novel
site, Thr344, in cell-free assays and in intact cells, and that
activation of AMPK in SIRT1-transfected cells inhibited the
SIRT1-mediated deacetylation of p53 (Fig. 3C). To understand the mechanism by which AMPK regulates SIRT1,
we explored the potential effects of AMPK-a2 on the localization and phosphorylation of SIRT1, because these
mechanisms have previously been shown to play a role in
modulating the activity of SIRT1 (23–25). First, interactions
between AMPK-a2 and SIRT1 were clearly shown using
protein interaction assays in cell-free systems and in intact
cells (Fig. 4A and B) and the 2 proteins colocalised in the
cell nucleus (Fig. 4C). Second, the interaction was mapped to
the respective catalytic domains (Fig. 4D). Following these
observations, we hypothesized that AMPK might regulate
the activity of SIRT1 through direct phosphorylation. Using
a cell-free kinase assay, we showed that AMPK robustly
phosphorylates SIRT1 (Fig. 5A) and the site of phosphorylation was mapped to Thr344, which lies within the catalytic
domain of SIRT1. Although it has been reported previously
that there was no direct phosphorylation of SIRT1 by AMPK
(26), we clearly observed a direct phosphorylation using
various forms of puriﬁed AMPK in cell-free assays, as well
as in intact cells (Fig. 5E). One explanation for this discrepancy may be the different methodologies used. Nevertheless,
our ﬁndings strongly support the view that SIRT1 is a direct
target for AMPK.
Following the identiﬁcation of the AMPK phosphorylation
site on SIRT1, the effect of SIRT1 phosphorylation by AMPK
was studied through the generation of nonphosphorylatable
(T344A) and potentially phosphomimetic mutants (T344E).
Thr344 phosphorylation of SIRT1 did not affect its localization,
but had a large effect on the deacetylase activity of SIRT1,
both in cell-free assays and in intact cells. Our results show that
the phosphomimetic mutant (T344E) had very little p53 deacetylase activity, comparable with that observed with the
dominant-negative H363Y mutant of SIRT1 (Fig. 6A). Furthermore, the T344E mutant was incapable of deacetylating p53 on
treatment of HepG2 cells with etoposide, indicating that
phosphorylation at Thr344 inactivates the deacetylase activity of SIRT1 against p53 (Fig. 6B). It has been reported that
amino acid residues Thr344 to Asp348 of SIRT1 are highly
conserved among different species and are important for
the deacetylase activity (27, 28). Moreover, Ile347 of SIRT1,
which is in close proximity to Thr344, interacts with the acetyl
group of acetylated p53 (16), suggesting that phosphorylation
of Thr344 might directly interfere with SIRT1 substrate binding. Indeed, we showed that phosphorylation of Thr344 interrupts the interaction of SIRT1 with acetylated p53 as shown by
a GST afﬁnity pull-down assay (Fig. 6C). Although, our data
strongly indicates that Thr344 phosphorylation blocks SIRT1

www.aacrjournals.org

substrate binding, the possibility exists that this phosphorylation also affects its binding with the cofactor NADþ, as
this region of the protein also has extensive interactions with
NADþ (27, 29).
It has been well characterized that the acetylation status of
p53 plays an important role in its transcriptional activity
(21, 30). Consistently, we showed that the T344E substitution
silenced the ability of SIRT1 to suppress p53 transcriptional
activity in HCC cells, and promoted the transcription of the p53
target genes, p21CIP and Bax (Fig. 6E). Because p21CIP and Bax
are important proteins involved in induction of apoptosis (31,
32), we next showed that ectopic expression of the wild-type or
phosphorylation-defective T344A mutant of SIRT1, but not the
phosphomimetic T344E mutant, promoted etoposide-induced
apoptosis and inhibited cell proliferation in HepG2 cells (Fig.
6F and G). Thus, the ability of AMPK to phosphorylate and
inactivate SIRT1, and the subsequent activation of the p53dependent apoptotic pathway, suggested a possible mechanism for AMPK to inhibit tumor growth in HCC. Taken
together, these data are in line with the hypothesis that AMPK
mediates its tumor suppressive effect in HCCs by promoting
p53 acetylation.
Although 2 studies on cultured myotubes have shown a
positive inﬂuence of AMPK on SIRT1 in studies of metabolism
(26, 33), we have clearly shown a negative regulation of SIRT1
by AMPK in the HCC cancer model. Although there are
parallels between the roles of AMPK and SIRT1 in metabolic
regulation, their roles in cancer are distinct. One explanation
for these apparently opposing ﬁndings is that liver cell function
was examined in different contexts in the 2 studies. The LKB1AMPK pathway is implicated in p53-dependent senescence (5),
whereas SIRT1 promotes cellular senescence through the
inactivation of p53 (34). Our ﬁnding that AMPK inhibits the
activity of SIRT1 and reverses the suppressive effect of SIRT1
on p53 supports the idea that these 2 proteins have opposing
effect on p53 regulation. As we found that AMPK is frequently
downregulated in HCC, our model provided an explanation on
how the dysregulation of the AMPK pathway would promote
