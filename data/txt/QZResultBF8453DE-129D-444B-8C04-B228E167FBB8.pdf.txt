Abstract

Author Manuscript

Background—The standard of care for patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC) has
changed to favor targeted therapy over immunotherapy. Differences in patterns of progression
between patients treated with these 2 modalities, and the impact of disease stabilization on
outcome, were investigated.
Methods—Patients who progressed on first line antivascular therapy (AVT) or interferon were
identified, and their medical records reviewed.
Results—A total of 162 patients met inclusion criteria for this analysis. Patients in the AVT
group had better baseline performance status, fewer liver metastases, and more responses (CR +
PR) compared with the interferon group. Both groups were equally likely to develop distant
metastases; however, for patients in the AVT group, these new metastases were more likely to
arise in the setting of controlled disease at baseline sites (18% vs 4%, P = .012). There was no
difference in anatomic sites of progression between the 2 groups. Patients responding (CR + PR)
to AVT trended toward longer progression-free survival (PFS) compared with patients with stable
disease (SD) (P =.06). No difference between responders and SD was seen in the interferon group.

Author Manuscript

Conclusions—Patients with RCC treated with antivascular therapy were more likely to progress
at new sites in the setting of stable disease at baseline sites, suggesting that AVT may be more
effective at controlling existing sites of disease than it is at preventing new metastases. Patients
with SD on AVT had shorter PFS compared with responders (CR + PR). Whether this relationship
extends to overall survival requires further study.

The treatment landscape for metastatic renal cell carcinoma (RCC) has changed dramatically
in the past few years. Previously, the standard of care for patients with advanced disease was
cytokine therapy, such as high dose interleukin-2 (IL-2) or interferon-alpha. Although a
small percentage of durable complete responses (CRs) were seen with these therapies,
overall response rates were low, with modest improvement in progression-free survival
(PFS), and a small but consistent CR rate seen in patients who received high-dose IL-2.1,2

Author Manuscript

Recently, multiple new agents targeting the cell signaling pathways involved in
angiogenesis have made their way into the clinic. Among these are sorafenib, sunitinib,
bevacizumab, and erlotinib—agents which inhibit signaling by vascular endothelial growth
factor, platelet-derived growth factor, or both. In randomized controlled trials,
antiangiogenic agents have shown increased response rates and improved survival in
patients with RCC when compared with interferon.3-5
Despite these significant advances, none of these new treatments are curative, and the vast
majority of patients with RCC ultimately demonstrate progression of their disease while on
treatment. Although anatomic patterns of metastatic spread have previously been described
at first recurrence after resection, we are unaware of any published data describing patterns
of disease progression in patients on systemic treatment.6

Author Manuscript

Controversy exists about how best to measure clinical benefit in patients on targeted agents.
The Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) were published in 2000 to
standardize response assessment in cancer patients and to align disease regression with
clinical benefit.7 Unfortunately, not all diseases respond in the same manner to systemic
therapy. With the advent of targeted agents, the validity of RECIST has been called into
question. We sought to better understand the relationship between disease stabilization and
progression-free survival (PFS), an endpoint that has begun to gain acceptance as a valid
surrogate for treatment benefit in RCC patients treated with targeted therapy.
We report here the results of a retrospective evaluation of patients treated with interferonalpha and antivascular agents at M. D. Anderson Cancer Center, and comparatively assess
their patterns of relapse, and the relationship between commonly used outcome measures.

Materials and Methods
Patient Population
Data were collected on all eligible patients enrolled on 1 of 3 institutional review board
approved clinical trials conducted at M. D. Anderson Cancer Center between March 2002
and October 2007. This retrospective investigation was approved by the M. D. Anderson
Cancer Center internal review board and the requirement for informed consent was waived.
Study treatments included 1 of the following: sorafenib, sorafenib plus interferon, erlotinib,

bevacizumab plus erlotinib, or interferon alone at 1 of 2 candidate dose levels (0.5 million U
twice daily or 5 million U daily). Inclusion and exclusion criteria for all 3 trials were similar.
All trials required patients to have metastatic, measurable, histologically confirmed RCC.
Patients who had received prior anticancer therapy or who had known brain metastases were
excluded. The antivascular trials limited enrollment to patients with Eastern Cooperative
Oncology Group performance status (PS) of 0 or 1. The interferon study included patients
with PS of 0, 1, or 2. Patients with non–clear-cell RCC were included in the interferon trial
but excluded from the antivascular trials. Patients on the bevacizumab alone or in
combination with erlotinib study were required to have their primary kidney tumor in place
and be candidates for cytoreductive nephrectomy. Patients on the other 2 studies were
allowed regardless of prior nephrectomy status. There were no criteria in any of the studies
to exclude or include patients on the basis of their metastatic sites, with the exception of
brain metastases as described.

Author Manuscript

The following groups of patients were excluded from our analysis (see Fig. 1): patients who
had not yet progressed on study therapy, patients who changed therapies or who died before
disease progression, and patients in whom progression or sites of progression could not be
verified by imaging. In addition, patients treated with combination sorafenib and interferon
were excluded as they would fit in both categories of treatment used for comparison.

Author Manuscript

Data were collected prospectively in the M. D. Anderson genitourinary research database
describing baseline patient characteristics, toxicities, and response to therapy. Response to
therapy was defined as either complete response (CR), partial response (PR), stable disease
(SD), or progressive disease (PD) according to RECIST in all cases.7 PFS was defined as
time from date of enrollment to date of progression or last follow-up. Imaging reports
contained in the patients' medical records were retrospectively reviewed to determine sites
of metastases at baseline and at time of progression. New sites of disease were defined as
new organ sites as distinct from new metastases in a previously involved organ site. Organ
sites of metastases at baseline and at progression were classified into 8 categories: lymph
nodes, lung, bone liver, brain, skin, contralateral kidney/renal fossa, and other. The primary
tumor, when in place, was included in the assessment of RECIST response, but was not
considered a metastatic site for the analysis of patterns of metastatic spread.
Statistical Methods

Author Manuscript

Patient characteristics were summarized by treatment group. The difference in continuous
patient characteristics between the 2 treatment groups was assessed using Wilcoxon rank
sum test and chi-square test or Fisher exact test was used to assess the association between
patient categorical characteristics and treatment. Kaplan-Meier method was used to generate
PFS curves by response and by treatment. Log-rank test was used to assess the difference in
PFS among response groups and Bonferoni method was applied to adjust for the multiple
pair-wise tests. All computations were carried out using SAS (SAS institute, Cary, NC).

Results
Patient Characteristics
From March 2002 to October 2007, 238 eligible patients were enrolled in the 3 clinical trials
included in this analysis. Patients were separated into 2 groups: those enrolled on the
antivascular therapy trials, and those enrolled on the interferon trial. After exclusion criteria
were applied (Fig. 1), 162 patients, all of whom had progressed on study by April 1, 2008,
were determined to be eligible for this retrospective review. Of these, 15 were treated with
erlotinib and bevacizumab, 14 with bevacizumab alone, 31 with sorafenib, and 102 with
interferon at either intermediate or low dose.

Author Manuscript

All patients were assessed for sites of metastases at baseline and at progression as described.
Summary statistics of patient characteristics by treatment group are shown in Table 1.
Patients treated on the interferon trial were more likely to have hepatic metastases, poor
performance status, and lower response rates compared with patients treated with
antivascular therapy. Patients treated on the antivascular studies were less likely to have
lung metastases. Otherwise there was no significant difference between the 2 groups.
Response rates at measurable sites as defined by RECIST criteria were higher in the
antivascular therapy group compared with interferon. The most common sites of baseline
metastases in both groups were lung, lymph node, and renal fossa/contralateral kidney. In
addition to the common anatomic sites, 11 patients had baseline sites of metastases
categorized as “other”. Baseline sites coded as “other” were mainly visceral sites of disease
including pancreas and bowel.
Sites of Disease Progression

Author Manuscript

Patients in both groups were equally likely to develop metastases at new sites. However,
patients treated with antivascular therapy who progressed with metastases at new sites were
more likely to do so in the setting of controlled disease at existing sites, compared with
patients treated with interferon (P = .012) (Table 2). There was no significant difference
between the treatment groups when comparing rates of progression at old sites only, or
progression at both old and new sites concurrently.
The single most common anatomic site of disease progression in both groups was the lung,
with 50% of the patients in the interferon group and 66% of patients in the antivascular
therapy group showing either new lung metastases or growth of existing lesions. This
finding is not surprising, as the lung was the most prominent site of disease at baseline.

Author Manuscript

Patients treated with antivascular therapy were as likely to progress at any given anatomic
site as those treated with interferon (see Table 3). The most common sites of new disease
were the same for both groups: bone and lymph node. There was no difference in the
incidence of clinically significant brain metastases between the 2 treatment groups.
However, although patients with known brain metastases were excluded from all 3 clinical
trials, patients on the antivascular therapy trials were screened for brain metastases before
study entry with baseline brain imaging, whereas patients on the interferon trial were not.

Analysis of RECIST Endpoints

Author Manuscript

In the past 8 years, the response rate measured using RECIST has been used as a primary
endpoint in clinical trials.7 Because antivascular therapy is presumably working at the level
of the endothelial cell compartment, and is less likely to directly affect the epithelial
compartment, SD has been considered an indicator of treatment benefit. To assess the
significance of SD in the context of antivascular therapy, we compared the PFS rates of
patients responding to therapy (CR + PR) with those with SD or PD. Patients with CR or PR
to antivascular therapy trended toward longer PFS compared with patients with SD (P = .06)
(Fig. 2). No significant difference in PFS was observed between responders (CR + PR) and
patients with SD in the interferon group (Fig. 3). By definition, a statistically significant
difference in PFS existed between patients (with CR, PR,) or SD and patients with PD in
both groups.

Discussion
Targeted therapies have revolutionized the treatment of RCC over the past 5 years. Now that
these agents are widely used, there is a need to re-evaluate what we know about the behavior
of RCC in this new treatment setting. The current study was performed to compare
progression patterns of patients treated with antivascular targeted therapies with patients
treated with interferon, and to assess the impact of disease stabilization on patient outcomes.

Author Manuscript

We found that anatomic sites of progression were similar in both treatment groups and were
consistent with previously reported patterns of relapse in high risk localized disease after
nephrectomy.6,8 Of greater significance is the finding that patients treated with antivascular
therapy were significantly more likely to progress with new metastases in previously
uninvolved anatomic sites in the setting of controlled disease at existing sites. This pattern
was not seen in patients treated with interferon. Overall, we found the patterns of
progression in the interferon group similar to those previously reported for cytokine
therapy.9 Both groups were equally likely to progress at baseline sites alone, or to progress
at baseline sites with concurrent development of metastases in a new anatomic site. The
mechanism of action of the antivascular therapeutic agents investigated here—sorafenib,
erlotinib, and bevacizumab—involves targeting of multiple pathways with a variety of
proposed downstream effects. However, central to the mechanism of each is the effect on
decreasing and disrupting tumor vasculature.10,11 These results strengthen the theory that
antivascular therapy may be most effective at controlling established, vascularized tumors,
whereas micrometastases or infiltrative disease may be less responsive to the effects of these
targeted therapies.

Author Manuscript

This finding has significant implications in terms of how we conceptualize treatment for
RCC and how we combine these targeted agents therapeutically. Typically, we consider
systemic therapy as a means of “cleaning up” micrometastatic disease, while concurrently
treating macroscopic disease, a theory that underlies the concept of adjuvant therapy in solid
tumors. Our data suggest that targeted antivascular therapy may be better thought of as
extended local therapy, targeting established primary tumors and metastases. It would be of
interest to explore the combination of targeted therapies with treatments aimed at controlling
micrometastatic disease such as cytotoxics or experimental therapies with an antimetastatic

scientific rationale. These data also suggest caution in assuming that the efficacy of these
agents is ensured in patients with high-risk, resected, RCC. The results of ongoing adjuvant
studies are extremely important to define the scope of antivascular therapy.12 Neoadjuvant
targeted therapy has also been considered for RCC, and recent reports show that in select
patients treatment can downstage primary kidney tumors, making them more amenable to
surgery.13 In light of data presented here, neoadjuvant therapy for the purposes of
downstaging would be reasonable. However, use of such therapies in the neoadjuvant setting
with the hopes of decreasing the micrometastatic burden is open to debate.

Author Manuscript

On the basis of the evolving experience in treating a variety of solid tumors with newer
targeted therapies, many have called into question the entrenched practice of relying on
RECIST endpoints to describe disease response to these agents.14-16 Here we sought to
evaluate whether response, complete or partial as defined by RECIST, predicted superior
PFS compared with SD as similarly defined. We found a strong trend toward prolonged PFS
in patients with CR or PR as their best response to antivascular therapy, compared with
those whose best response was disease stabilization (Fig. 2). However, in patients treated
with interferon, response compared with SD did not affect PFS (Fig. 3). Further evaluation
with larger numbers of patients is needed to confirm these results, and to investigate the
appropriateness of using RECIST response as a surrogate for overall survival. In addition,
investigation is ongoing into the use of radiographic calculations other than tumor
measurements to describe disease response in solid tumors.17

Author Manuscript

There are some specific caveats that need to be raised about our analysis. The treatment
groups were somewhat unbalanced at baseline, with patients with poor performance status
and hepatic metastases clustered in the interferon group. This was due to the fact that poor
performance status patients were excluded from the antivascular trials. Patients in the
interferon group had lower response rates and higher rates of progressive disease compared
with patients treated with antivascular therapy. These results are expected based on what we
have learned from randomized clinical trials comparing interferon with various antivascular
therapies, but may be a result of the poorer baseline patient characteristics in the interferon
group. It is also not known whether the poorer baseline characteristics of the interferon
patient group biased our progression analysis. Future analysis with prognostically matched
groups may aid in answering these questions. Finally, this is a retrospective review subject
to the limitations of such an analysis. These results are hypothesis generating and should be
further investigated in a prospective manner before conclusions can be drawn.

Author Manuscript

In summary, we show that patients on antivascular agents will progress at new sites of
disease alone more frequently than patients on immunotherapy, while achieving superior
control at existing sites of disease. To improve therapy for RCC, we need to define and
abrogate the biological processes that promote the generation of new sites of disease, while
continuing to improve on the efficacy of existing tumoristatic treatments.
