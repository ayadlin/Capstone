ABSTRACT
Melanoma is a largely incurable skin malignancy owing to the underlying
molecular and metabolic heterogeneity confounded by the development of resistance.
Cancer cells have metabolic flexibility in choosing either oxidative phosphorylation
(OXPHOS) or glycolysis for ATP generation depending upon the nutrient availability in
tumor microenvironment. In this study, we investigated the involvement of respiratory
complex I and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) in melanoma progression. We show that
inhibition of complex I by metformin promotes melanoma growth in mice via elevating
lactate and VEGF levels. In contrast, it leads to the growth arrest in vitro because
of enhanced extracellular acidification as a result of increased glycolysis. Inhibition
of LDH or lactate generation causes decrease in glycolysis with concomitant growth
arrest both in vitro and in vivo. Blocking lactate generation in metformin-treated
melanoma cells results in diminished cell proliferation and tumor progression in mice.
Interestingly, inhibition of either LDH or complex I alone does not induce apoptosis,
whereas inhibiting both together causes depletion in cellular ATP pool resulting in
metabolic catastrophe induced apoptosis. Overall, our study suggests that LDH and
complex I play distinct roles in regulating glycolysis and cell proliferation. Inhibition
of these two augments synthetic lethality in melanoma.

INTRODUCTION

melanoma cells, owing to the BRAF mutation, depend
majorly on glycolysis for ATP generation, and exhibit
dysfunctional oxidative phosphorylation [6, 7]. Cancer
cells derive ATP, biosynthetic intermediates, and reducing
equivalents by unusually engaging in biochemical
pathways such as glycolysis, glutaminolysis, and the
pentose phosphate pathway [5]. Normal (non-cancerous)
cells derive ATP primarily through mitochondrial
OXPHOS; while cancer cells rely mainly on aerobic
glycolysis to generate ATP and glycolytic intermediates
those facilitate rapid growth [4, 5]. Enhanced lactate
generation has been correlated with aggressiveness
of cancer. Numerous studies have identified lactate
dehydrogenase (LDH), which catalyzes the conversion of
pyruvate to lactate, as the most consistent marker of the
aggressive and rapidly growing cancers [8-11]. LDH plays

Malignant melanoma is one of the most aggressive
forms of skin cancer with high metastatic potential
and resistance to many cytotoxic agents [1, 2]. Despite
extensive research and partial successes gained by the use
of currently available drugs there is no effective treatment
against malignant melanoma [1-3]. Melanoma cases are
increasing every year and account for about 75% of skin
cancer-related deaths worldwide [2, 3]. Poor response to
currently available therapeutic options and development of
resistance to therapy warrant exploration of new strategies
to treat melanoma.
Enhanced aerobic glycolysis is a characteristic
feature of many cancers [3-5]. It has been reported that

an important role in regulating glycolysis, maintaining
cellular redox state, mitochondrial physiology and tumor
maintenance [12]. Altered metabolism of cancer cell
can be associated with mitochondrial dysfunction which
involves inhibition of OXPHOS, increase in reactive
oxygen species (ROS) and promoting uncontrolled
growth, that in turn further supports the development of
a metastatic phenotype [13,14]. Respiratory complex I
is the largest and most complex enzyme which catalyzes
oxidation of NADH in electron transport chain [15].
Complex I plays important role in ATP generation in
normal cells and is a main site of ROS generation,
however, its role in tumorigenesis is largely unclear.
Most of the reports suggest that complex I activity is
suppressed in cancer cells and its inhibition promotes
proliferation and metastasis [16-18]. Conversely, it has
also been reported that melanoma cells display increased
OXPHOS function which causes drug resistance [19-21].
Owing to the metabolic flexibility in choosing various
metabolic pathways, particularly glutamine metabolism
[22], melanoma cells can escape from perturbation of a
molecule in a metabolic pathway [23]. Therefore, more
than one molecules of different metabolic pathways need
to be targeted for an effective and curative outcome.
Biguanides like metformin and phenformin are
known to inhibit respiratory complex I. Metformin, a
first line therapy for patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus
(T2DM), is a member of the biguanides and has been
recently discovered to have anti-tumorigenic activity [24,
25]. At physiological level, metformin exerts its biological
activity by decreasing hepatic glucogenesis, increasing
insulin sensitivity, elevating peripheral glucose uptake and
reducing absorption of glucose from the gastrointestinal
tract [26]. At the cellular level, metformin works primarily
by inhibiting mitochondrial complex I, which impedes
oxidative phosphorylation resulting in decreased ATP
level leading to activation of AMPK [27-30]. Moreover,
it has been shown that metformin decreases mitochondrial
respiration coupled with ATP generation, thereby causing
an increase in glycolysis [31, 32]. The anticancer action
of metformin has been shown in various cancers with
distinct mechanisms [33, 34]. However, role of metformin
in melanoma is not much clear. Unlike other cancer types,
metformin is shown to have both tumor promoting as
well as antitumor activity in melanoma [35-37]. Also,
metformin, in combination with BRAF inhibitors, has
been shown to suppress melanoma growth [38].
In the present study, with the speculation that
disrupting ATP generating routes by inhibiting complex
I and LDH together could be synthetically lethal to
melanoma cells, we used metformin or phenformin
and oxamate/dichloro acetate (DCA) to inhibit these
two enzymes using both cell and animal models. We
demonstrate that inhibition of complex I and LDH activity
have distinct impact on cell growth and proliferation.
Interestingly, inhibition of complex I by metformin further

promotes aerobic glycolysis resulting in enhanced tumor
growth in mice. Ablation of metformin-induced lactate
generation by using oxamate or DCA leads to cytostasis
and/or apoptosis in melanoma cells.

RESULTS
Metformin exhibits distinct in vitro and in vivo
actions on growth of melanoma
Metformin suppresses tumor growth by inhibiting
complex I which is influenced by glucose [30]. Moreover,
glucose is known to alter the activity of respiratory
enzymes [39]. Therefore, to explore the consequence(s)
of complex I inhibition and influence of glucose on action
of metformin on melanoma progression, we monitored
isograft/xenograft progression in streptozotocin (STZ)
induced hyperglycemic mice. We noted that metformin
promoted B16F10 derived isograft progression in
hyperglycemic mice as compared to untreated control
(Figure 1A, 1B and 1C). Also, metformin positively
influenced progression of tumor in normoglycemic
C57BL/6J mice (Figure 1D, 1E and 1F). Similarly, oral
administration of metformin promoted growth of A375
xenograft in hyperglycemic as well as in normoglycemic
NOD/SCID mice as compared to untreated control (Figure
1G, 1H and 1I).
To check the cellular and molecular events
associated with increased tumor progression, tumor
sections were examined for histopathological analysis.
High cell density and reduced necrosis were clearly
visible in the sections of both tumor types (B16F10
derived isograft as well as A375 derived xenograft)
from metformin administered mice (Figure 2A and 2B).
We noted that metformin enhanced proliferation and
progression of A375 derived xenograft was phenotypically
distinct as compared to the control tumor. This is
suggestive of a grade advancement of primary tumor,
evident by elongated morphology of nuclei compared
to rounded morphology in the control tumors sections
(unpublished information). Immunohistochemical staining
of the cell cycle regulatory protein cyclin D1 (Figure 2C)
was found to be higher in tumor section from metformin
administered mice. Further, we validated the enhanced
tumor growth by checking status of cell cycle regulatory
proteins by immunoblotting of tumor lysates. We found
that levels of molecules cyclin D1, CDK4, E2F1 and
PCNA were increased significantly in the tumor lysates
of metformin administered mice as compared to control,
while p21 level was diminished (Figure 2D). These results
indicate that metformin, irrespective of glycemic status of
mice, promotes melanoma growth by modulating cell cycle
regulatory proteins. Moreover, immunohistochemical
analysis of tumor sections strengthened this observation,

because metformin treatment enhanced protein levels
of CD31, an endothelial marker (Figure 2E and 2F),
and increased the serum level of VEGF (Figure 2G),
suggesting that metformin promotes angiogenesis in
melanoma tumors.
Next, we checked effect of metformin on the
growth and proliferation of melanoma cells in vitro.
In contrast to our in vivo findings, metformin treatment
resulted in growth suppression of melanoma cells in
vitro (Supplementary Figure S1A, S1B, S1C and S1D).
Thereafter, we investigated the impact of complex I
inhibition using metformin and phenformin on melanoma
cells growth as both of these inhibited complex I activity

(Supplementary Figure S2). We found that metformin
and phenformin caused growth arrest in melanoma
cells grown under high glucose. However, in presence
of low glucose, treatment with these agents resulted in
cell death (Supplementary Figure S3A, S3B, S3C and
S3D). It is likely that metformin mediated growth arrest
is due to reduction in glucose level and extracellular
acidification, of media (Supplementary Figure S4A and
S4B). Interestingly, replacing the medium after every
12 h with fresh medium containing 25 mM glucose
increased clonogenic survival upon metformin treatment.
As metformin-treated cells utilized glucose very rapidly
in comparison to the control; therefore, replenishment

level and pH thereby survival of cells in the presence of
metformin (Supplementary Figure S4C and S4D). These
results suggest that concentration of glucose available in
the culture medium influences metformin’s action.

increased tumor growth and proliferation [14-18]. As we
observed that metformin treatment caused acidification
of culture medium due to enhanced aerobic glycolysis
(Supplementary Figure 4A and 4B), we therefore
speculated that this might be the reason for cell growth
arrest. Thus, we measured level of glucose as well as
lactate in the spent culture medium collected from control
and metformin treated cells. Increased glucose utilization
(as evident by the presence of less residual glucose
in medium) and higher lactate level was detected in
metformin treated cells as compared to the control (Figure
3A and 3B).
To strengthen these findings, we further explored
the expression pattern and activity of some of the
proteins and enzymes involved in regulating glycolysis.

Inhibition of respiratory complex I activity
promotes aerobic glycolysis
Discrepancy in the outcome of metformin treatment
in vivo and in vitro prompted us to explore the cause for
the same. It is known that metformin exerts its action
primarily by inhibiting mitochondrial OXPHOS enzyme
complex I [27-29] and inhibition of complex I results in

We found that metformin increased protein levels of key
glycolytic molecules GLUT1, LDHA and ChREBP in
a concentration dependent manner (Figure 3C). These
results suggest that inhibition of complex I activity by
metformin could possibly enforce cancer cells to adopt
glycolytic route for ATP generation causing enhancement
in tumor progression in mice.
To evaluate whether glycolytic phenotype can
also be induced in vivo upon inhibition of complex I,
we first checked the level of glucose in serum collected
from mouse bearing tumor along with normoglycemic
mice treated or untreated with metformin. Significant
decline in the level of serum glucose was observed in
metformin administered normoglycemic, tumor bearing
mice (104.3 ± 13.7 mg/dl in C57BL/6J, and 134.0 ± 7.2

mg/dl in NOD/SCID) as compared to untreated control
(139.7 ± 16.3 mg/dl in C57BL/6J, and 168.0 ± 8.5 mg/dl
in NOD/SCID) (Figure 3D and 3E). Similarly, metformin
treatment caused reduction in serum glucose in tumor
bearing hyperglycemic mice (Met, 237.3 ± 30.0 mg/dl
in C57BL/6J, and 227.3 ± 12.3 mg/dl in NOD/SCID) as
compared to control (388 ± 31.5 mg/dl in C57BL/6J, and
409.3 ± 18.6 mg/dl in NOD/SCID mice) (Figure 3D and
3E). Secretion of lactate is a hallmark of glycolytic tumors.
Therefore, we checked lactate level which was found to be
very high in the serum of tumor bearing normoglycemic as
well as hyperglycemic mice administered with metformin
(Figure 3F and 3G). Elevated serum LDH is associated
with high grade aggressive tumors and poor prognosis
in case of metastatic melanoma [8-10]. Thus, serum

LDH activity was monitored and was found to be very
high in the serum collected from hyperglycemic and
normoglycemic mice administered with metformin as
compared to control (Figure 3H and 3I). Furthermore,
increased LDH activity was detected in tumor tissues of
metformin administered mice compared to the untreated
control (Figure 3J).

melanoma tumors, lactate generation was inhibited by
using LDH inhibitor oxamate and PDK1 inhibitor DCA.
We found that oxamate and DCA alone have inhibitory
effect on melanoma cell growth (Figure 4A, 4B and 4C;
Supplementary Figure S5). Reduced cell survival was
observed upon treatment with oxamate or DCA together
with metformin (Figure 4A, 4B and 4C). Similarly, other
well-known glycolytic inhibitors like phloretin (GLUT1
inhibitor), 2-deoxy-D-glucose (2DG), and iodoacetate
also restricted proliferation of melanoma cells treated
with metformin (Supplementary Figure S6A and S6B).
Enhanced glucose uptake through GLUT1 and increased
aerobic glycolysis through LDHA and PDK1 is the
hallmark of cancer cells. Therefore, we chose oxamate and
DCA over other glycolytic inhibitors.
Next, to check the long term survivability of

melanoma cells in the presence of metformin and oxamate/
DCA alone or in combination together, we performed
clonogenic survival assay. No surviving colonies were
detected in melanoma cells treated with oxamate and
metformin together (Figure 4D, 4E and 4F). Similar
results were also obtained in cells treated with metformin
and DCA together (Figure 4D, 4E and 4F). Subsequently,
we checked whether inhibition of these two enzymes
induced death in melanoma cells as evident by Annexin
V and PI staining. All these agents alone caused growth
arrest, but did not induce apoptosis. However, increased
apoptosis was detected in A375 and B16F10 cells treated
with oxamate/DCA together with metformin as compared
to single agent alone (Figure 5A and 5B). This observation
was further confirmed by immunoblotting for the apoptotic
markers PARP1, Bax and Bcl-2 (Figure 5C and 5D).
Increased PARP cleavage and Bax level while decreased

level of antiapoptotic protein Bcl-2 was detected in cells
treated with metformin and oxamate/DCA together as
compared to single agent alone (Figure 5C and 5D). These
results indicate that inhibition of complex I and LDH
together can promote induction of apoptosis.
Next, we have checked the impact of metformin
and oxamate/DCA either alone or in combination on
the survival of non-cancerous cells. We used three
different non-cancerous cell lines namely AML12 (mouse
hepatocytes), L6 (rat muscle cells) and MEF (mouse
embryonic fibroblasts) to test the effect of combination
treatment. Although, combination of metformin and
oxamate/DCA slackened the proliferation of these cells
(Supplementary Figure S7A, S7B and S7C), it did not
affect the cell viability (Supplementary Figure S7D),
indicating that this combination is effective in selectively
killing cancer cells.

imposes metabolic catastrophe

ATP levels by inhibiting substrate level phosphorylation
and OXPHOS respectively (Figure 6C). Also, a significant
decline in ATP level was detected in cells treated with
oxamate and metformin together (Figure 6C). Further,
to confirm the involvement of LDH in melanoma cell
growth and proliferation, knock down of LDHA (LDHAKD) was performed using specific siRNA (Figure 6D).
Increased cell death was observed in LDHA-KD cells
treated with metformin or phenformin (Figure 6E). A
significant reduction in glycolysis (as evident by decreased
glucose utilization and lactate secretion) and ATP level
was observed in LDHA-KD cells as compared to control
(Figure 6F, 6G and 6H). Moreover, decrease in glycolytic
rate as well as a sharp decline in ATP level was observed

To ensure whether oxamate and metformin cotreatment affects metabolism of melanoma cells, we
measured metabolic parameters in presence of these
inhibitors. Metformin treatment elevated glycolysis,
while oxamate treatment resulted in decrease in glucose
utilization and lactate secretion (Figure 6A and 6B).
Interestingly, glucose utilization and lactate secretion
was inhibited significantly upon treating cells with both
oxamate and metformin together (Figure 6A and 6B).
Additionally, both oxamate as well as metformin reduced

in LDHA-KD cells treated with either metformin or

that simultaneous inhibition of both complex I and LDH or

leading to growth arrest and cell death.

and oxamate together treated mice. We noticed that mice
administered with metformin developed larger tumor as
compared to the untreated control (Figure 7A, 7B and
7C). While in mice administered with oxamate, tumors
progressed at a slower rate than the untreated control as
well as in mice administered with metformin (Figure 7A).
Interestingly, we observed that oxamate retarded tumor
progression dramatically when administered together with
metformin as evident by reduction in tumor volume and
tumor weight (Figure 7A, 7B and 7C).
Further, to confirm whether abrogation of metformin
induced tumor progression by oxamate is a consequence
of reduction in aerobic glycolysis, we measured metabolic
parameters in vivo. Metformin administered mice had low
serum glucose, higher lactate and LDH levels in serum
as compared to control, whereas relatively higher serum

glucose and low lactate level were detected in the mice
treated with oxamate alone or metformin together with
oxamate (Figure 7D and 7E). Activity of LDH enzyme was
significantly diminished in the tumors excised from mice
treated with oxamate alone or metformin together with
oxamate (Figure 7F). Relatively very low level of ATP
was detected in the tumors of mice administered with both
oxamate and metformin together as compared to single
agent alone. However, we did not observe significant
changes in the protein levels of molecules regulating
glycolysis (Figure 7I). Importantly, no significant change
in body weight was detected in the mice receiving
combination treatment and no possible adverse side
effects or gross symptoms of generalized toxicity were
observed upon visual inspection (Supplementary Figure
S8A). Moreover, seemingly no pathological abnormalities
were observed in the vital organs like lung, liver, kidney
and heart of these mice (Supplementary Figure S8B).
These results suggest that this combination does not exert
generalized toxicity and effective in retarding tumor
progression in mice.

mice administered with metformin and growth rate varied
depending on glycemic status of mice (Figure 2D and 2E).
This observation concurs with recent report demonstrating
that metformin facilitates tumor progression of BRAF
mutant melanoma cells [35].
Disparity in the action of metformin on the
growth of melanoma cells in vitro and in vivo is likely
to be influenced by the availability of glucose and lactate
concentration which might influence its action. Metformin
inhibits cell growth and induces apoptosis under glucose
limiting conditions [43], while we noticed that in presence
of high glucose it causes growth arrest without affecting
cell death. We reasoned for this discrepancy that cancer
cells derive ATP via OXPHOS under metabolic stress,
whereas when glucose is abundant ATP is derived mainly
through glycolysis. Inhibiting complex I under high
glucose condition further promotes glycolysis resulting
in excess lactate generation, and occurrence of this
phenomena has been reported earlier [44]. Collectively,
these findings suggest that growth arrest induced by
metformin in melanoma cells in vitro is a consequence
of acidification of medium due to excess lactic acid
accumulation because of rapid utilization of available
glucose. Notably, metformin induced growth arrest can be
prevented by replenishing medium frequently to maintain
optimum growth conditions, as metformin treated cells
required more glucose to proliferate due to enhanced
aerobic glycolysis. This mimics in vivo condition wherein
probably rapid, constant circulation of access lactic acid
allows cancer cells to use more glucose which helps in
rapid proliferation. Moreover, lactate can also be utilized
by cancer cells in tumor [45, 46]. Additionally, it has
been reported that metformin induces angiogenesis via
elevating VEGF level [35, 47]. We report that inhibition
of complex I increases lactate production and it has been
previously suggested that the glycolytic switch enhances
angiogenesis [48, 49]. Our results show a positive
correlation between serum lactate and VEGF level in
mice administered with metformin. Therefore, it is likely
that metformin-enhanced tumor growth is facilitated by
lactate induced angiogenesis that can be mediated by
VEGF [48]. Furthermore, we observed increased level of
E2F1, an important cell cycle regulatory molecule, in the
tumors excised from mice administered with metformin.
In addition to promoting cell proliferation, E2F1 also
regulates many genes involved in glycolysis [50] which is
essential for rapid growth of cancer cells. Therefore, it is
likely that, E2F1 might play an important role in mediating
metformin-induced rapid tumor progression probably via
regulating aerobic glycolysis.
Glycolytic inhibitors such as 2-deoxy glucose,
lonimide, 3-bromopyruvate, DCA, and drugs interfering
with metabolic pathways have shown promising outcome
in suppressing tumor growth [40-42, 51-53]. In addition,
targeting lactate generation pathway is appealing
especially in glycolytic cancers [54, 55]. Melanoma cells

DISCUSSION
Cancer cells including melanoma cells divert huge
amount of carbon flux to glycolysis [5-7]. This helps
the cells to generate ATP and other building blocks for
rapid tumor growth [5]. Several reports suggest that
targeting metabolic pathways reduces tumor progression
and cell growth in vitro [40-42]. In the present study, we
demonstrate that metformin promotes melanoma growth
by elevating glycolysis owing to the inhibition of complex
I function, while inhibition of LDH causes growth arrest
in cells. Inhibiting lactate generation in melanoma cells
treated with metformin affects cell survival thereby
causing reduction in tumor progression (Figure 8).
Consequences of inhibiting complex I on growth
of cancer cells are not clearly understood though,
reports suggest that complex I inhibition leads to cellular
transformation and enhances cell growth [14-18].
Conversely, inhibition of complex I has also been reported
to retard tumor progression in mice [30]. These diverse
outcomes are likely to be dependent on the availability
of nutrients in the tumor microenvironment. It has been
reported that when glucose is available in abundance,
inhibition of complex I promote glycolysis and rapid
proliferation of cells, while it induces cell death under
metabolic stress conditions [43]. In this study, we observed
that inhibition of complex I by metformin promotes
melanoma tumor progression in mice.
While metformin has been shown to inhibit
proliferation of many cancer cells and also restricts tumor
progression of xenograft in mice [33, 34], it is known
to exert growth inhibitory as well as growth promoting
effects in melanoma [35-37]. Interestingly, we detected
that B16F10 and A375 derived tumors grew rapidly in

are metabolically glycolytic, thereby rely primarily on the
high activity of LDH for ATP generation [6]. Melanoma
cells overexpress LDH and high serum level often
correlates with poor prognosis and patient survival [3,
8-10]. Our results indicate that disrupting the conversion
of pyruvate to lactate profoundly affects proliferation of
melanoma cells. This is in agreement with the reports
that tumors of glycolytic cell types are more susceptible
towards inhibition of LDH-A with FX11 [56].
LDH plays an important role in metabolic
homeostasis and tumor maintenance [12, 57]. We
used oxamate and DCA to inhibit lactate generation
in melanoma cells. DCA is an orally deliverable small
molecule that has been used for treatment of lactic
acidosis, and restoration of OXPHOS functionality
by DCA has been shown to induce cell death [52, 53].
Moreover, DCA has previously been shown to reduce
lactate production and triggers apoptosis in melanoma

cells [58, 59]. Oxamate, an analog of pyruvate, is also
used to inhibit LDH. A recent study by Miskimins et
al., suggests that targeting complex I and LDH together
can be a promising strategy to halt growth of aggressive
cancers [60]. Concurrence with this, we also noticed
that preventing lactate generation and simultaneously
inhibiting complex I by oxamate/DCA or by LDH specific
siRNA and metformin respectively results in depletion
of cellular ATP pool. Decline in cellular ATP pool
evokes metabolic catastrophe which leads to apoptosis
in melanoma cells. Metabolic catastrophe-induced cell
death is considered as a promising strategy to halt cancer
progression [61]. Moreover, our study signifies the distinct
role of complex I and LDH in cell proliferation, and these
two constitutes ATP generating route either through
OXPHOS or substrate level phosphorylation respectively.
Blocking either of the enzymes alone does not induce
cell death as cells can switch to alternative pathway for

Figure 8: Schematic representation of synthetic lethality induced by combination of metformin and oxamate treatment
in melanoma. A. Inhibition of respiratory complex I by metformin or phenformin alone results in elevation of glycolysis owing to the

activation of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). Generation of building blocks and ATP exclusively through glycolysis helps in rapid tumor
growth. B. Targeting LDH or lactate generation by oxamate and DCA or by siRNA causes activation of OXPHOS and subsequent ATP
generation. However this leads to suppression of cell proliferation without inducing cell death. C. Blocking both the enzyme together
induces metabolic catastrophe owing to the depletion of cellular ATP pool. This leads to the initiation of apoptosis, and suppression of
tumor growth. Complex I and LDHA form a synthetically lethal pair in melanoma cells.

ATP generation. Whereas, simultaneously inhibiting both
of these two, induces apoptosis. This clearly indicates
that cells depend on the function of these two enzymes
which form synthetically lethal pair, which is a promising
phenomenon that can be employed for selective targeting
of melanoma cells [62, 63]. Given that E2F1 is involved
in regulating apoptosis [64], it is likely that the apoptosis
induced by the combination of metformin and oxamate/
DCA might involve E2F1. Metformin promotes apoptosis
in cancer cells via activating p53 [37]. However, in case
of melanoma, role of p53 is not clear. As the literature
suggests, p53 is non-functional in melanoma and its
levels are paradoxically elevated in advanced grades of
melanoma [65-67]. Previously, we have reported that
elevated level of p53 is associated with increase in tumor
growth [68]. Therefore, it is unlikely that p53 is involved
in apoptosis induced by the combination treatment and,
thus, more studies are needed to evaluate the functionality
of E2F1 and p53 in melanoma.
While using combinations of different drugs which
can synergistically promote cancer cell death, this may also
enhance toxicity to normal cell. Therefore, it is crucial to
access the impact of the combination treatment on normal
cells. Importantly, our data suggest that this combination
is effective in killing cancer cells both in vitro as well in
vivo, and has least impact on the survival of normal cells.
The differential sensitivity between melanoma and normal
cells due to metformin and oxamate/DCA combination can
be attributed to the fact that melanoma cells are highly
glycolytic and overexpress molecules involved in lactate
generation and secretion as compared to normal cells [3,
6-10]. Interestingly, in comparison to normal cells, cancer
cells display higher uncoupled mitochondrial respiration
[31]. Cancer cells upon treatment with metformin exhibit
greater compensatory elevation in glycolysis than normal
cells [31, 32], thus weighing the metabolic susceptibility
of cancer cells. Therefore, inhibiting LDH or lactate
generation/secretion suppresses cancer cell growth while
normal cells are least affected as sufficient ATP can still
be produced from OXPHOS because metformin is a
weak complex I inhibitor. As OXPHOS activity is higher
in normal cells as compared to the melanoma cells,
metformin and oxamate/DCA combination is likely to
have least adverse impact on respiration of normal cells.
Our study opens new avenues in targeting
metabolism of cancer cells and can be further implicated
in testing other clinically approved drugs known to
inhibit glycolysis along with metformin. The present
study suggests that any drug/inhibitor that blocks lactate
generation can be used in combination with metformin
for the better management and preventing tumor growth.
For example, rapamycin, a clinically approved drug is
shown to prevent lactate generation [69, 70]. Similarly,
it has been shown that inhibition of BRAF results in
suppression of glycolysis [6, 7]. Therefore, rapamycin
as well as BRAF inhibitors can be used along with
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

metformin to improve therapeutic outcome with reduced
side effects. Collectively, our results indicate that LDH
or other mechanism which control lactate generation
or secretion is critical for rapid melanoma progression
under OXPHOS-compromised conditions, and this can be
exploited as a suitable therapeutic target for controlling
growth of glycolytic cancer cells. More extensive studies
are needed to evaluate functionality of LDH and complex I
in other cancer models, and subsequently their implication
in cancer therapy in general.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Animal experiments
Mice were procured from Experimental Animal
Facility (EAF) at National Centre for Cell Science
(NCCS), Pune, India. Hyperglycemia in mice was induced
using STZ as previously described [71] with slight
modifications. Briefly, male C57BL/6J and NOD/SCID
mice were fasted for 6 h prior to intraperitoneal injection
of STZ (50 mg/kg) in 0.01 M citrate buffer (pH 4.4) for
three consecutive days. Blood glucose measurement was
performed by nipping the tail and applying blood on to a
glucose analyzer (Accu-Chek Active, Roche, Germany).
Mice having blood glucose value over 200 mg/dl were
considered as hyperglycemic. Tumor was induced by
injecting B16F10 (2 × 105) or A375 (1 × 106) cells in 100
µl sterile PBS subcutaneously at right flank of C57BL/6J
and NOD/SCID mice respectively. Tumor progression
was monitored regularly by measuring its size with a
digital caliper (Sigma, USA) following the appearance
of palpable tumors. Oral administration of metformin
on alternate days was initiated a week prior to tumor
challenge in hyperglycemic mice. Otherwise metformin
was given only after tumor reached to an optimum size
and the treatment was continued till the completion of
the experiment. At the end of the experiment, mice were
sacrificed; tumors were excised and stored in either
-80°C or in 10% formalin solution for further studies. In
another set of experiment, mice (C57BL/6J background,
male) were randomly divided into 4 groups following the
appearance of palpable tumor. To examine the outcome of
metformin treatment in combination with LDH inhibitor
oxamate, mice were given orally either metformin (200
mg/kg) or oxamate alone (500 mg/kg) or both together
on every alternate day. Tumor progression was regularly
monitored with a caliper. At the end of experiment, tumor,
muscle and liver tissues were excised, weighed and stored
in -80°C for further analysis. All animal experiments have
been performed as per the guidelines of the committee

(Nunc, USA) and allowed to grow for 24 h. Treatment
of metformin and other inhibitors were given for desired
time periods and concentrations. Cells were washed with
chilled sterile PBS and fixed with 3.7% paraformaldehyde
solution at room temperature for 10 min. These were then
permeabilized with 0.025% Triton X-100 in PBS for 10
min and subsequently blocked with 5% BSA in PBS for
1 h at 37°C. Cells were incubated with 1:100 dilutions of
primary antibodies in the blocking solution for 2 h at room
temperature and washed with TBST (TBS containing
0.05% Tween-20) at least five times before being
incubated with appropriate labeled secondary antibodies
(1:200) in blocking solution for further 1 h at room
temperature. After five washes with TBST, samples were
layered with mounting medium containing DAPI (Santa

Immunohistochemistry and histopathology

Cell lysate preparation and immunoblotting

Immunohistochemical and histopathology was
performed according to the Malvi et al. [72]. Briefly,
fine sections of tumor, and other organs were made
with microtome fixed on glass slides and parafinized.
For immunohistochemistry, slides were deparafinized
in xylene solution twice for 10 min, and subsequently
washed thrice with 100%, 95%, 70% and 50% ethanol.
Slides were again washed with distilled water followed
by washing with PBS for 5 min. For antigen retrieval,
slides were boiled in sodium citrate buffer (0.01 M, pH
4.5) in microwave oven for 10 min and allowed to cool at
room temperature for further 20 min. BSA or normal goat
serum (2%) was used for blocking in humidified chamber
or in cold box for 1 h. Slides were probed with desired
antibodies (1:100 dilution) in PBST (PBS containing
0.025% Tween-20) containing 0.01% BSA for 2 h at room
temperature or overnight at 4°C. Slides were washed with
PBST 4 times for 5 min, and were probed with compatible

water, dehydrated with absolute alcohol followed by
layering with mounting medium, and then analyzed for
the expression of desired molecules. For histopathology,
deparafinized slides were stained with hematoxylin and
eosin, and microscopic analysis for cell density, cellular
morphology, metastasis, cytotoxicity and necrosis was
performed by pathologists in a blinded manner at KEM
Hospital Pune, India.

Cells (5 × 102) were plated in 12 well plates for 24
h. Cells were treated without or with 25 mM or 50 mM
oxamate and 10 or 20 mM DCA along with metformin
and continued for further 48 h. Subsequently, medium
was replaced with fresh drug-free medium. Plates were
incubated for an additional 10-15 days at 37°C in CO2
incubator with medium change on every 2-3 days. Cells
were then fixed (3% paraformaldehyde and 0.02%
glutaraldehyde in PBS) and stained with 0.05% crystal
violet.

Cellular cytotoxicity and survival assay
Approximately 5 × 103 (B16F10) and 10 × 103
(A375 and SKMel28) cells were seeded in each well of
96 well tissue culture plates and allowed to adhere for
24 h at 37°C. Cells were treated as per the experimental
requirement and proliferation or viability was assessed
by MTT assay. MTT (50 µl, 1 mg/ml in DMEM without
phenol red) was added to each well and incubated for
4 h at 37°C. Formazan crystals were solubilized in 100
µl of isopropanol by incubating with shaking at room
temperature for 5 min. Absorbance was taken at 570 nm
using 630 nm as reference filter. Untreated cells were
considered as control (100% cell survival).

Glucose utilization assay
Cells (3 × 105) were cultured in DMEM containing
25 mM glucose. After 24 h, medium was replaced with
respective medium containing increasing concentration
of metformin (0.1 mM, 0.5 mM, 1 mM, and 2 mM) or
rotenone for 24 h and residual glucose present in the spent
medium was monitored using GOD-POD based glucose
assay kit (Spinreact, Spain) according to manufacturer’s
instructions. For measuring glucose utilization in the
presence glycolytic inhibitors, cells were treated with
50 mM oxamate, 100 µM phloretin, and 20 mM DCA,
either alone or together with 2 mM metformin or 100
µM phenformin. Consumed glucose was estimated by
subtracting the remaining glucose in the medium from
the initial concentration in control medium (450 mg/dl).
The experiments were performed at least in triplicate and
values were normalized to total number of cells.

Detection of apoptosis by annexin V staining
Cells were seeded at a density of approximately
3 × 105 cells in 35 mm plates and allowed to grow for
24 h. Cells were treated with or without oxamate and
DCA either alone or with metformin for 48 h or as the
experimental requirement. Cells were harvested by
trypsinization and processed for flow cytometry. Apoptosis
was detected by dual staining of Annexin V and PI using
apoptosis assay kit (BD Bioscience, USA) according to
manufacturer’s instructions.

Lactate estimation assay
Lactate concentration in spent medium collected
from the cells treated with or without metformin, oxamate
and other glycolytic inhibitors, was determined using
commercially available lactate estimation kit (Spinreact,
Spain) as per the manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly,
culture medium or serum was diluted in 0.9% saline up to
10 times and 10 μl of sample was added to each well of 96
well ELISA plate. 150 µl of reagent provided with kit was
added to each sample containing wells keeping unspent
medium and reagent alone as blank and absorbance was
recorded at 405 nm using a spectrophotometer (ThermoScientific, USA). Experiments were done at least in
triplicate and the final values were normalized with total
number of cells.

Cell cycle analysis
Cells were seeded at a density of approximately 3
× 105 cells in 35 mm plates and allowed to grow for 24
h. Cells were treated with or without metformin, oxamate
and other glycolytic inhibitors alone or together as
indicated for 48 h or as experimental requirement. Cells
were harvested by trypsinization and processed for flow
cytometry. Briefly, cells were washed with chilled PBS
and fixed in 70% ethanol on ice for 30 min. Following
RNase (200 μg/ml) treatment for 30 min at 37°C, 50 μg/
ml PI was added to cell pellet and incubated in dark for 30
min on ice. The fluorescence of PI was recorded through a
585 nm filter in a flow cytometer (FACS Calibur, Becton
Dickinson, California, USA). Data were analyzed using
Cell Quest Pro software for 10,000 cells.

fraction) was added to 700 µl of distilled water taken in
a 1 ml cuvette, followed by addition of 100 µl potassium
phosphate buffer (0.5 M, pH 7.5), 60 µl of fatty acid-free
BSA (50 mg/ml), 30 µl of KCN (10 mM) and 10 µL of
NADH (10 mM). Final volume was adjusted to 994 µl
using distilled water, mixed by inverting the cuvettes and
the baseline reading was acquired at 340 nm for 2 min.
Reaction was started by adding 6 µl of decylubiquinone
(10 mM, Sigma, USA) mixed properly by inverting the
cuvettes. Decrease in the absorbance at 340 nm was
followed for 10 min. Similar procedure was followed
for the calculation of complex I activity in presence 2
mM metformin and 100 µM phenformin. Rotenone (10
µM) was used as a positive control. Final values were
normalized with total cellular protein content.

Preparation of mitochondria rich fraction from
cells and tissues

Total cellular ATP measurement

Mitochondria rich fraction was prepared from
cultured cells and tumors or normal tissues as previously
reported [73]. Briefly, cells (1 × 106) were plated in 10
cm plate and were trypsinized following treatment with
the desired inhibitors for 24 h. Cell suspension was
subjected to three cycles of freeze-thawing in hypotonic
buffer (20 mM potassium phosphate). This suspension was
centrifuged at 50,000 rpm for 1 h to obtain supernatant rich
in mitochondria. Similarly, to isolate mitochondria from
tissues, frozen tissues were chopped into fine pieces and
homogenized in homogenization buffer (0.5 M Tris buffer
pH 7.5, 100 mM EGTA, and 250 mM sucrose), followed
by cyclic freeze-thaw procedure and centrifuged at 50,000
rpm for 1 h. Supernatant was collected as mitochondrial
fraction and used for the determination of mitochondrial
function and OXPHOS enzyme activity.

ATP level was measured by using commercially
available ATP bioluminescence kit (Roche, Germany)
according to manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, cells
were grown in the presence of indicated drugs. Cells
were harvested and lysed in 100 mM Tris-EDTA buffer
containing 0.01% NP-40 and boiled for 1 min followed by
thee freeze-thaw cycle. Luminescence was recorded for
blank as well as for samples. For measuring ATP generated
exclusively through OXPHOS and glycolysis, cells were
treated with oligomycin (10 µM) and oxamate or DCA
respectively with or without metformin. Experiments
were done in triplicate and repeated at least once, and final
values were normalized with total protein contents.

Statistics

Enzyme assays

Statistical analysis was performed using Sigma
Plot 12.0 (Systat Software Inc., CA, USA). Most of the
experiments were repeated at least once with minimum

represented as mean ± SD except for the indicated
experiments. Wherever required, either paired or unpaired,
two tailed student t-test was employed in the experiments
assuming unequal variance unless otherwise mentioned, to
calculate p-value. The values *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p
< 0.001 denote significant differences between the groups
(n > 3 at the least).

Cells were homogenized in hypotonic (20 mM)
potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.5) containing protease
inhibitor cocktail (Roche, Germany), vortexed and lysed
by three cycles of freeze and thaw procedure. For preparing
extract from tissues, tumor samples were chopped into fine
pieces and homogenized in homogenization buffer (0.1M
Tris, 0.1 M KCl, 350 mM EDTA and 1 M sucrose, pH 7.5)
using tissue homogenizer. Homogenates were clarified by
centrifuging at 10,000 rpm for 10 min at 4°C and kept on
ice until the assays are performed.
LDH activity assay: Lactate dehydrogenase activity
in cell lysates or tumor extract and serum was determined
using LDH activity assay kit (Spinreact, Spain) according
to manufactures instructions.
