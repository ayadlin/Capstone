Persistent Cyclooxygenase-2 Inhibition Downregulates
NF-κB, Resulting in Chronic Intestinal Inflammation in the
Min/+ Mouse Model of Colon Tumorigenesis
Adelaide M. Carothers, Jennifer S. Davids, Beatrice C. Damas, and Monica M. Bertagnolli

Abstract
Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibition prevents adenoma formation in humans and mouse models of colon
cancer. The selective COX-2 inhibitor celecoxib reduces COX-2 and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) expression and
adenomas in the intestine of Min/+ mice after treatment for several weeks, but prolonged treatment increases
PGE2 production, resulting in drug-resistant tumor formation and transforming growth factor β (TGFβ)–
dependent intestinal fibrosis. In this study, we examined pathways that regulate COX-2 expression and suppress chronic intestinal inflammation. We show that NF-κB signaling was inhibited in the ileum of Min/+ mice
receiving long-term treatment with celecoxib. This effect was associated with inhibition of TGFβ-associated
kinase-1 and IκB kinase α/β activities and reduced expression of the Toll-like receptor (TLR) 2 and TLR4 that
enhance colonic barrier function. Additionally, we observed reduced activities of protein kinases c-Jun
NH2-terminal kinase 1 and protein kinase A and transcription factor cyclic AMP–responsive element binding
protein, regulators of COX-2 expression, which cross-talk with NF-κB. In ileum subjected to long-term
celecoxib treatment, we noted relatively higher expression of COX-2, vascular endothelial growth factor,
and interleukin-1β in Paneth cells, whereas NF-κB and COX-2 were more strongly expressed by an expanded
population of stromal myofibroblasts. Our findings argue that celecoxib resistance is an acquired adaptation
to changes in the crypt microenvironment that is associated with chronic intestinal inflammation and
impaired acute wound-healing responsiveness. Cancer Res; 70(11); 4433–42. ©2010 AACR.

Introduction
Chronic inflammation promotes tumorigenesis by altering
the intestinal microenvironment in ways that both activate
the stroma and enhance epithelial cell growth and survival.
Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and its downstream prostaglandin, prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), are driving factors in colorectal
cancer (CRC) and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD; ref. 1).
COX-2 inhibition by nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs
(NSAID) effectively prevents the formation of precancerous
adenomas in humans (2).
We showed that responses to celecoxib in the intestine
change with the duration of treatment. Using the Apc-deficient
Min/+ mouse, a CRC model, we reported that resistance
occurred with long-term treatment (3). Short-term (3 wk) celecoxib treatment of these mice inhibited intestinal adenoma

formation, COX-2 expression, and PGE 2 production, but
long-term (5 mo) treatment accelerated tumor growth and
progression. Importantly, high levels of PGE2 and COX-2
expression recurred in tumors and nontumor mucosa of longterm–treated mice. Recently, we showed that long-term celecoxib treatment increased the number of COX-2–expressing
myofibroblasts in the ileum and resulted in transforming
growth factor β (TGFβ)–mediated intestinal fibrosis resembling patients with and rodent models of IBD (4).
The transcription factor NF-κB regulates inflammation
and plays a role in CRC promotion (5). NF-κB signaling is
activated by bacterial products, such as lipopolysaccharides
(LPS), and inflammatory cytokines, and its transcriptional
targets include the genes encoding COX-2, intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), vascular endothelial growth factor
(VEGF), and inflammatory cytokines interleukin-1β (IL-1β)
and tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα). NF-κB signaling is
needed to orchestrate wound-healing responses to acute intestinal injury, and its long-term inhibition is associated with
chronic intestinal inflammation (6, 7). NF-κB signaling positively regulates the expression of Toll-like receptors (TLR),
which, when activated, promote signals required for innate
immunity (8). Several studies showed the relevance of TLRs
to COX-2 expression. For instance, LPS-induced TLR4 activation caused NSAID-suppressible, NF-κB–dependent expression of COX-2 in enterocytes (8). In addition, several lines
of evidence link TLR signaling to intestinal tumorigenesis.

TLR signaling in response to gut microbial flora modulated
the number of tumors in Min/+ mice (9). Signal transduction from TLRs depends on the NF-κB upstream adaptor
MyD88, and TLR signaling-deficient MyD88−/−Min/+ mice
developed fewer intestinal tumors with reduced COX-2 expression than MyD88+/+Min/+ littermates (10). Importantly,
under conditions of tissue injury, MyD88 function was
required to position COX-2–expressing mesenchymal cells
around the base of crypts in the colon to stimulate enterocyte proliferation (11).
NF-κB is integrated with other pathways and activated by
inflammatory cytokines during wound healing to allow proper
temporal sequence and eventual termination of responses. For
instance, receptor binding of the cytokines TNFα, IL-1β, and
TGFβ activates TGFβ-associated kinase-1 (TAK-1) and subsequently NF-κB (12). Showing pathway cross-activation, TGFβ
enhanced IL-1β–mediated TAK-1 activity and IL-1β–activated
canonical TGFβ signaling (13). Consistent with the requirement of TLR signaling and NF-κB activity for homeostasis, inducible TAK-1 ablation in enterocytes caused colitis (14).
Whereas in certain contexts TGFβ induces NF-κB–dependent
COX-2 expression, it inhibits COX-2 activity in others (15).
Moreover, PGE2 both stimulates inflammation and promotes
wound-healing resolution. PGE2 elicits this negative feedback
by autocrine signals initiated from its G protein–coupled
receptors (EP2/4) that modulate intracellular cyclic AMP
(cAMP; ref. 16). In these circumstances, PGE2 induces cAMPdependent and protein kinase A (PKA)–dependent inhibition
of NF-κB and TGFβ signaling that limits inflammation (17, 18).
Intestinal wound-healing and inflammatory responses also
involve cross-talk between COX-2 and Wnt signaling, a crucial pathway for enterocyte proliferation and tumorigenesis
(19). Increased Wnt signaling stimulates enterocyte proliferation, allowing rapid coverage of surface lesions (20). PKA
activates the transcription factor cAMP-responsive element
binding protein (CREB), which positively regulates COX-2
expression (21) and also activates certain Wnt target genes
(22). PGE 2 stimulates Wnt signaling downstream of the
epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR); activity of this
receptor tyrosine kinase is constitutively increased in the
Min/+ mucosa relative to Apc+/+ littermates (23). Finally,
the mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) c-Jun NH2terminal kinases (JNK), which phosphorylate certain transcription factors, also promote COX-2 expression (24). After
specific MAPK kinase (MKK)–mediated activation, JNKs and
other MAPKs cross-talk extensively with the NF-κB pathway.
In the intestine of Min/+ mice, celecoxib resistance likely is
not intrinsic but rather is a reversible adaptation to targeted
therapy (25). Therefore, acquired resistance should alter the
microenvironment of the intestinal crypt composed of epithelial and mesenchymal cells. COX-2 expression in this
modified niche by any or all of its cell types then should exceed the bioavailable drug concentration. Here, we asked
what effects long-term COX-2 inhibition produced in pathways that regulate inducible COX-2 expression. We expected
to find changes in NF-κB activity and other pathways known
to promote COX-2 expression and chronic intestinal inflammation. A better understanding of the biology underlying this

type of drug resistance will inform the design of safer and
more effective CRC chemoprevention strategies.

Materials and Methods
Materials
C57BL/6J-Min/+ mice were purchased from The Jackson
Laboratory. Ten mice per treatment group were fed AIN76A diet (Research Diets) with/without celecoxib (1,500 ppm)
for timed intervals (3, 4). Antibodies are listed in Supplementary Table S1.
Immunohistochemical analyses
Immunohistochemistry used standard techniques (3); for
CD34, IL-1β, TLR2, TLR4, and VEGF, all solutions were prepared in Antibody Diluent (Invitrogen). Immunohistochemistry of control and treatment groups was performed in parallel.
Experiments were repeated using tissues from three different
mice of each treatment group. Quantitative analysis and cell
counting of immunohistochemistry used only well-oriented
crypt-villus units from nontumor ileum of three different mice
per treatment group and were performed by an investigator
blinded to treatment status. Twelve high-powered fields (120
crypt-villus units) for von Willebrand factor–positive (vWF+)
cell counting were analyzed per treatment group. For MPO+
cell counting, 50 crypt-villus units were analyzed per treatment group. For comparison of the mean number of NF-κB
p65+ myofibroblasts, simultaneous immunohistochemistry
for vimentin+ and p65+ cells was performed on serial sections,
and doubly positive cells were counted in 50 crypt-villus units.
Statistical evaluations used an unpaired Student's t test.
Immunoblotting
Ileum of Min/+ mice untreated or treated with celecoxib
for 4 days, 3 weeks, or 5 months was processed; lysates were
prepared; and immunoblottings were performed as described
(26). Total cell lysates from scraped small bowel mucosa
mainly reflect expression patterns in enterocytes because
they outnumber stromal cells by >100-fold (26). Immunoblottings were replicated three times. All experiments were repeated using tissues from two different mice of each
treatment group. For NF-κB, ImageJ software from the NIH
determined relative band intensities (27). Data were pooled
and quantitatively analyzed from three independently performed experiments for total versus active NF-κB p65. Band
intensity was normalized to the internal β-actin control and
then compared relative to the untreated control as a fold difference using the unpaired Student's t test (P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant).

Results
Long-term celecoxib treatment suppressed TLR–TAK1–NF-κB signaling in the ileum of Min/+ mice
NF-κB signaling in enterocytes shortly after injury induces the expression of cytokines that recruit myeloid cells
from the circulation to initiate healing (7). To learn the
effect of celecoxib treatment on NF-κB expression and

Chronic Celecoxib Treatment Inhibits NF-κB

activity, immunoblotting analyses were performed using lysates prepared from mucosa of the nontumor ileum of
Min/+ mice that were untreated versus celecoxib treated
(4 d, 3 wk, and 5 mo). Expression of total NF-κB p65
protein (filled columns) and its active form, NF-κB p65p-Ser536 (hatched columns), increased after 4 days of treatment but declined thereafter to amounts lower than were
found in untreated controls (Fig. 1A, left). Importantly,
NF-κB activity was significantly lower in animals treated
long term (P = 0.006). The active forms of IκB kinase
(IKK) α/β kinases phosphorylate the NF-κB inhibitor IκBα,
causing its turnover. Expression of these kinases was elevated after 4 days but decreased after 3 weeks. Sustained
inhibition of NF-κB p65 was confirmed by the reduced active IKKα/β levels in the long-term–treated lysate relative
to the untreated one. After 4-day treatment, IκBα expression was reduced, consistent with an initial NF-κB signaling induction. IκBα expression was increased in the
long-term–treated sample to a level that resembled the
untreated control. Confirming that IκBα expression in
the untreated lysate was similar in the long-term–treated
one, the amount of NF-κB p65 protein was not significantly different (P = 0.06).
Expression of ICAM-1 is NF-κB inducible in enterocytes
in vivo (7); the level of this proangiogenic protein was increased after 4-day treatment (Fig. 1B). NF-κB activity triggered by chemical wounding is known to cause signal
transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) activation (STAT3-p-Y705), stimulating enterocyte proliferation
and survival (7). In our model, active STAT3 was increased
in 4-day–treated Min/+ ileum relative to the untreated control but was decreased in samples from 3-week– and
5-month–treated mice (Fig. 1B). Consistent with STAT3 activation, its transcriptional target, suppressor of cytokine
signaling 3, was induced after 4-day treatment (Fig. 1B).
NF-κB signaling in enterocytes immediately after injury also induces the expression of cytokines that recruit myeloid
cells (macrophages and neutrophils) from the circulation
to initiate healing (7). We used an antibody for myeloperoxidase (MPO), a myeloid cell-specific marker to identify
these cells by immunohistochemistry. We found that
MPO+ cells were significantly increased in the lamina propria of Min/+ mice treated with celecoxib for 4 days relative to the control (Fig. 1C).
Recently, we reported that the number of COX-2–expressing
myofibroblasts was increased in ileum of Min/+ mice treated long term with celecoxib (4). Immunohistochemistry of
serial sections for NF-κB p65 and vimentin, a myofibroblastspecific marker, was performed on ileum of Min/+ mice
treated with and without celecoxib. Doubly positive cells
were counted. As observed previously, treatment of Min/+
mice for 3 weeks significantly reduced the number of
NF-κB p65+ myofibroblasts in the lamina propria, whereas
long-term treatment increased their number (Fig. 1D). The
nuclear expression of NF-κB p65 was not observed in crypt
enterocytes by this method.
Active TAK-1 (TAK-1-p-Thr180/187) phosphorylates IKKβ,
both stimulating NF-κB signaling and protecting enterocytes

against chronic inflammation (12, 14). Immunoblottings
showed that levels of total TAK-1 protein were invariant
with respect to treatment duration. However, levels of active
TAK-1 were inversely associated with the duration of celecoxib treatment. As expected, TAK-1-p-Thr 180/187 levels
correlated with those of IKKα/β-p-Ser176/180 (Fig. 2A). TAK1-p-Ser412 is a different isoform associated with a cAMPPKA–dependent pathway (28). Relative to the untreated
control, TAK-1-p-Ser412 expression also was decreased with
lengthened treatment time, suggesting a corresponding
decrease in PKA activity.
TLR4, TLR2, and NOD2 expression is NF-κB dependent
and enhances enterocyte barrier function (8, 10). Immunoblotting analysis of these receptors in the tissue lysates
showed that 3-week and long-term drug exposures reduced
TLR4 and TLR2 expression (Fig. 2B), whereas NOD2 expression was unchanged. Immunohistochemistry of serially
sectioned ileum showed differential staining of crypt base
enterocytes for TLR4 but low overall staining of the entire
crypt-villus unit for TLR2. Consistent with these results,
twice as much protein was needed to produce band intensities
for TLR2 that were similar to that of TLR4, indicating that
Min/+ enterocytes contain a lower level of TLR2 compared
with TLR4. In contrast, however, more stromal cells were positively stained for TLR2 at all treatment times relative to TLR4.
The complete treatment series are shown in Supplementary
Figs. S1 and S2. These results suggest that innate immunity
was reduced in long-term–treated Min/+ mice.
Long-term celecoxib treatment increased microvessel
density, the number of CD34+ vessels in the submucosa,
and VEGF expression in Paneth cells
Angiogenesis is an essential feature of intestinal inflammation, and short-term and celecoxib treatment is known to
produce antiangiogenic effects (29, 30). As further evidence
for chronic inflammation following long-term celecoxib
treatment, we examined the effect of celecoxib treatment duration on angiogenesis in the ileum of Min/+ mice. Using
antibody for the endothelial cell marker vWF to perform
immunohistochemistry, we counted the microvessel density
(MVD) in the ileum of study animals (Fig. 3A). MVD was
significantly reduced after 3-week treatment relative to
untreated mice but was increased after 5-month treatment.
This result correlated the inhibition of angiogenesis by shortterm celecoxib treatment with previously observed inhibition
of COX-2 and PGE2 expression and confirmed the opposite
effects after long-term treatment (3).
To confirm and extend this result, we performed immunohistochemistry for CD34, an endothelial progenitor cell
marker of new blood vessels. Overall CD34 staining of the
mucosa was low in short-term–treated but strong in longterm–treated Min/+ mice (Fig. 3B). Low-magnification
images best showed the staining intensity differences. Arrows
in the high-magnification images indicate CD34− vessels of
short-term–treated and CD34+ vessels of long-term–treated
Min/+ ileum. These results suggest that chronic exposure
to celecoxib promoted dynamic vessel remodeling. The entire
treatment series is shown in Supplementary Fig. S3.

Chronic Celecoxib Treatment Inhibits NF-κB

celecoxib exposure was associated with
reduced TLR2 and TLR4 expression and TAK-1
activity. A, immunoblottings examined
treatment time-dependent changes in
expression of TAK-1 versus its active isoforms.

VEGF is a key regulator of angiogenesis. Immunohistochemistry for VEGF expression in untreated and celecoxib-treated
ileum of Min/+ mice revealed positively stained enterocytes at
the base of crypts. Tissue sections are shown in two orientations. As in the case of TLR4 (Fig. 3C), VEGF-positive cells had
the appearance and localization of Paneth cells.
The number of Paneth cells and their expression of
IL-1β and COX-2 were modulated by the duration of
celecoxib treatment
Residing subjacent to the submucosa, Paneth cells are appropriately placed to modulate angiogenesis and were shown
to secrete other proangiogenic factors (31, 32). We therefore
examined the effect of celecoxib treatment time on these secretory enterocytes. Using immunohistochemistry to identify
the Paneth cell marker lysozyme, we counted the relative
number of positively stained cells (Fig. 4A) in treated and untreated tissues. Consistent with the known antiangiogenic
effect of celecoxib, the proangiogenic role of Paneth cells,
and our MVD data (Fig. 3A), treatment for 3 weeks reduced
the number of Paneth cells, whereas long-term treatment
increased their number relative to the control.
IL-1β, a potent inflammatory cytokine, is inducible by
NF-κB and can perpetuate NF-κB activation via autocrine
signaling. Production of active IL-1β requires processing in
lysosomes for secretion. Immunohistochemistry showed that
IL-1β was expressed in the secretory granules of Paneth cells,
implying that this cytokine is released into the lumen and

www.aacrjournals.org

acts on enterocytes (Paneth cells, stem cells, and progenitors) at the base of crypts (Fig. 4B, left). Immunoblotting
analysis also showed that expression of mature 17-kDa
IL-1β was increased by all celecoxib treatments relative to
the untreated control (Fig. 4B, right). Consistent with the
initial induction of NF-κB activity (Fig. 1A), overall IL-1β
expression in ileum was highest in the 4-day treatment
lysate. Finally, we found that COX-2 was also expressed in
Paneth cells of long-term–treated Min/+ mice. Figure 4C
shows 3-week– and 5-month–treated ileum cut in two orientations. By immunohistochemistry, COX-2 was more highly
expressed in Paneth cells (green arrows) and stromal cells
from long-term–treated mice when compared with those
treated short term. These results indicate that Paneth cells
of Min/+ mice contribute to celecoxib resistance and
modulate inflammation and angiogenesis.
Long-term celecoxib treatment suppressed alternate
pathways that cross-talk with NF-κB to activate
COX-2 expression
JNK1 and JNK2 phosphorylate transcription factors, are activated by a Ras-Rac1-MKK4 pathway, and stimulate COX-2
expression (33). By immunoblotting analysis, we evaluated
the relative expression of active MKK4 (MKK4-p-Ser80) and
JNK1/2 (JNK-p-Thr183/Tyr185) when compared with total
MKK4 and JNK1, respectively (Fig. 5A). The activity of
MKK4 was strongly reduced in the mucosa of Min/+ mice
after 5-month treatment but not the steady-state expression

of this protein. Overall expression of 42-kDa JNK1 declined
slightly with treatment duration; activity of this kinase was
reduced more severely. We did not pursue the possibility of
COX-2 expression via MKK7-JNK2 activity because of the low
intensity of the 54-kDa JNK2 band.

CREB is a transcription factor that promotes COX-2 expression (21). CREB transactivation requires phosphorylation
of Ser133 by PKA or other kinases. Immunoblotting analysis of
total CREB versus CREB-p-Ser133 levels in treatment samples
showed that activity of this regulator declined in parallel with

its overall expression (Fig. 5B). Because levels of PKAtargeted TAK-1-p-Ser412 were reduced in long-term–treated
versus untreated Min/+ mice (Fig. 2A), and PKA is a positive
regulator of CREB activity, we expected that celecoxib resistance would be associated with PKA inhibition. Of the three
PKA catalytic subunits, PKAβ was the predominant isoform
expressed in our mucosal lysates (data not shown). Active
PKAβ cat-p-Thr198 was reduced in mice treated with celecoxib for 3 weeks and longer. This result associated short-term
celecoxib-mediated COX-2 and PGE2 inhibition with a reduction of PKA activity and downstream NF-κB signaling, suggesting cross-talk between these pathways. Because the
level of PGE2 was increased but PKA activity remained low
after the 5-month treatment, chronic exposure of enterocytes
to celecoxib may have altered calcium signaling, as suggested

previously (16). Taken together, celecoxib resistance was associated with inhibition of pathways that stimulate COX-2
expression in most enterocytes but not in Paneth cells or
in stromal myofibroblasts. Moreover, associated with chronic
intestinal inflammation produced by long-term celecoxib
treatment was the suppression of signaling necessary for
acute wound healing.

Discussion
These data add to our previous findings, supporting the
hypothesis that short-term administration of celecoxib in
Min/+ mice is anti-inflammatory and tumor suppressive,
whereas long-term administration results in chronic inflammation and tumor promotion (3, 4). We showed that resistance to the antitumor effects of celecoxib in Min/+ mice
evolved by adaptations that altered enterocyte-stromal interactions and extracellular matrix (ECM) composition (3, 4).
Our present work revealed that NF-κB activation in small
bowel enterocytes of Min/+ mice occurred rapidly (4 d) after
initiating celecoxib treatment and induced a cellular program of NF-κB–dependent wound healing (Fig. 1A–C).
In contrast, long-term celecoxib treatment inhibited NF-κB
signaling in enterocytes, a condition associated with chronic
intestinal inflammation.
As indicated by the expression of target gene products
(VEGF, COX-2, and IL-1β), NF-κB signaling was upregulated
in Paneth cells and myofibroblasts of long-term–treated mice
(Figs. 1A and D and 4B and C). It is reasonable to propose
that Paneth cells and myofibroblasts produced the >2-fold increase in COX-2 expression in the mucosa of long-term–treated
Min/+ mice compared with controls to overcome the concentration of bioavailable drug in the stem/progenitor cell
compartment (3). The close apposition of myofibroblasts expressing COX-2 may also produce a physical barrier limiting
celecoxib bioavailability in the stem cell niche. In addition, it
is plausible that celecoxib resistance is limited to the crypt
base because this is where COX-2 cooperates with Wnt signaling. For instance, stem, progenitor, and Paneth cells maintain high levels of stabilized β-catenin to affect Wnt
signaling, and this oncoprotein can promote COX-2 gene
transcription and stabilize its mRNA (34, 35). Furthermore,
PGE2 stimulates enterocyte proliferation by transactivating
EGFR (19, 23), and COX-2 enhances Wnt signaling by increasing integrin-dependent adhesion to ECM (36, 37).
The increased number of Paneth cells in the celecoxibresistant Min/+ mucosa likely reflects enhanced survival of
these long-lived cells (Fig. 4A). Several other observations support a role for Paneth cells in this chronic inflammation model.
Paneth cells regulate the number and type of commensal microbes and limit pathogen contact with the mucosa (38).
These enterocytes exclusively express matrix metalloproteinase 7, an enzyme that both promotes tumorigenesis and inhibits chronic intestinal inflammation (39, 40). Germline
mutations predisposing to IBD modulate NF-κB signaling in
Paneth cells, as well as their relative number, survival, and
expression of inflammatory cytokines (41). To induce the
expression of defensins, Paneth cells activate NF-κB via a

Chronic Celecoxib Treatment Inhibits NF-κB

TLR2-NOD2-RIP2 pathway (42). The importance of this
pathway for the expression of defensins and survival signaling
was confirmed by the hypersensitivity to chemically induce
colitis displayed in mice bearing a conditional deletion of
NF-κB p65 in enterocytes (43). Finally, Paneth cells regulate
angiogenesis in the intestine during development and inflammation by secreting β-defensins and angiogenins (31, 32).
NSAIDs, including celecoxib, produce COX-2–independent
effects that are likely modulated by the duration of treatment
time. For instance, genome expression and proteome analyses
identified numerous changes in mRNA expression of nontumor
mucosa from familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) patients
treated with celecoxib for 1 year (44). COX-2–independent
pharmacologic effects were reported, including inhibition of
5-lipoxygenase and phosphodiesterase activities; suppression
of the latter caused increased intracellular levels of cyclic nucleotides and protein kinase G activity (45, 46). Interestingly,
IKKβ is a secondary pharmacologic target of celecoxib (47).
Here, we identified TAK-1 as the most upstream kinase in
the NF-κB pathway inhibited by long-term celecoxib exposure
(Fig. 2A). We showed that IL-1β was more highly expressed in
celecoxib long-term–treated relative to untreated Min/+ mice
(Fig. 4B). IL-1β overexpression was associated with chronic
intestinal inflammation after prolonged treatment of mice
with the selective IKKβ inhibitor ML120B (6). In addition,
we found that long-term celecoxib treatment inhibited IKKβ
activity (Fig. 1A), a result consistent with the essential role of
enterocyte-intrinsic IKKβ expression in maintaining intestinal homeostasis (48).
We do not yet know the extent to which the adaptive
processes here are present in FAP patients treated long term
with NSAIDs for prevention of colorectal adenomas. In addition, the relationship of this response to germline Apc mutation is not yet known, and studies of long-term NSAID
administration in animals that are wild-type at the Apc locus
are under way. Based on the results presented here, it may be
possible to maximize chemoprevention effectiveness while
limiting toxicity by using lower NSAID doses or by providing
drug holidays. Chemoprevention might also be achieved by
alternating NSAIDs such as celecoxib with other agents.
For example, statins inhibit isoprenoid synthesis, particularly
geranyl geranylpyrophosphate, thereby inhibiting RhoA and
its downstream kinase, ROCK (49). Statins also are direct

extracellular integrin antagonists (50). The statin simvastatin
showed anti-inflammatory effects in animal models of chemically induced colitis and tumor formation and inhibited
RhoA and induced NF-κB activities in doxorubicin-treated
colon cancer cells (51). Because we previously showed that
enterocytes of Min/+ mice constitutively maintain increased
RhoA activity, alternating cycles of celecoxib and simvastatin
may inhibit acquired resistance to celecoxib in this model. A
selective focal adhesion kinase (FAK) inhibitor may produce
a similar effect. For example, in nontransformed cells, FAK
activity is strictly integrin adhesion dependent. If celecoxib
resistance is associated with TGFβ signaling downstream
of integrin-ECM engagement, then a FAK inhibitor such as
PF-562,271 may enhance chemoprevention efficacy in combination with celecoxib.
In conclusion, the tissue-specific effects of chemopreventive NSAIDs such as celecoxib change over time. In association with an altered intestinal microenvironment, acquired
resistance may occur in nontumor IBD mucosa or premalignant adenomas, just as in invasive cancers (25). Signaling
pathway cross-activation may promote drug resistance (13).
The more selective the drug and the longer the treatment
time, the greater will be the pressure driving resistance. This
view is consistent with the model of dynamic reciprocity,
which posits that the microenvironment, especially the
ECM, exerts an influence on gene expression in epithelial
cells. Importantly, this type of drug resistance is reversible.
Our results emphasize that more comprehensive knowledge
of stromal-epithelial interactions, signaling cross-talk, and
negative feedback mechanisms operating during different
stages of inflammation and tumorigenesis is needed to
develop safe and effective CRC chemoprevention regimens.
