Abstract

Inhibition of kynurenine 3-monooxygenase (KMO), an enzyme in the eukaryotic tryptophan
catabolic pathway (i.e. kynurenine pathway), leads to amelioration of Huntington’s diseaserelevant phenotypes in yeast, fruit fly, and mouse models1–5, as well as a mouse model of
Alzheimer’s disease3. KMO is a FAD-dependent monooxygenase, and is located in the outer
mitochondrial membrane where it converts L-kynurenine to 3-hydroxykynurenine. Perturbations
in the levels of kynurenine pathway metabolites have been linked to the pathogenesis of a
spectrum of brain disorders6, as well as cancer7,8, and several peripheral inflammatory
conditions9. Despite the importance of KMO as a target for neurodegenerative disease, the
molecular basis of KMO inhibition by available lead compounds has remained hitherto unknown.
Here we report the first crystal structure of KMO, in the free form and in complex with the tightbinding inhibitor UPF 648. UPF 648 binds close to the FAD cofactor and perturbs the local active
site structure, preventing productive binding of the substrate kynurenine. Functional assays and
targeted mutagenesis revealed that the active site architecture and UPF 648 binding are essentially
identical in human KMO, validating the yeast KMO:UPF 648 structure as a template for structurebased drug design. This will inform the search for new KMO inhibitors that are able to cross the
blood-brain barrier in targeted therapies against neurodegenerative diseases such as Huntington’s,
Alzheimer’s, and Parkinson’s diseases.

There is great interest in the causative role of kynurenine pathway (KP) metabolites in
neurodegenerative disorders such as Huntington’s (HD) and Alzheimer’s diseases (AD)6.
Several of these metabolites are neuroactive: quinolinic acid (QUIN) is an excitotoxin10,11,
3-hydroxykynurenine (3-HK) generates free-radicals12, xanthurenic and cinnabarinic acids
activate metabotropic glutamate receptors13,14 and kynurenic acid (KYNA) is a
neuroprotectant6. KMO lies at a critical branching point in the pathway between the
synthesis of 3-HK\QUIN and KYNA (Figure 1a) and its activity plays a role in the
neurotoxic and neuroprotective potential of the pathway. In the brain, KMO is expressed at
low levels in neurons15 and is predominantly expressed in microglia1,16, the resident
immune cells of the CNS, suggesting a link between KMO function and inflammatory
processes in the brain.
Inhibition of KMO activity leads to amelioration of several disease-relevant phenotypes in
yeast, fruit fly, and mouse models1–5. Increased levels of KYNA relative to neurotoxic
metabolites appear critical for this protection. Restoring endogenous levels of 3-HK to fruit
flies lacking KMO activity eliminates this neuroprotection4, highlighting beneficial effects
of 3-HK reduction due to KMO inhibition. Additionally, pharmacological inhibition of
KMO is neuroprotective in animal models of cerebral ischemia17,18, reduces dystonia in a
genetic model of paroxysmal dyskinesia19, improves levodopa-induced dyskinesia in
parkinsonian monkeys20, and extends lifespan in a mouse model of cerebral malaria21.
Therefore, inhibition of KMO activity is an attractive therapeutic strategy for several acute
and chronic neurological diseases6.

Despite interest in targeting KMO only a few potent inhibitors are available, and none
appreciably penetrate the blood-brain barrier in adult animals3,22. One of these, UPF 648,
has an IC50 of 20 nM and provides protection against intrastriatal QUIN injections in
kynurenine aminotransferase (KAT II) deficient mice23. UPF 648 treatment also shifts KP
metabolism towards enhanced neuroprotective KYNA formation4,24, and ameliorates
disease-relevant phenotypes in a fruit fly model of HD4. That known inhibitors do not cross
the blood-brain barrier is an impediment to KMO-targeted drug discovery. KMO structures
in complex with tight-binding inhibitors are required to design small molecule inhibitors that
can penetrate the blood-brain barrier. With this in mind, we determined the crystal structure
of yeast KMO complexed with UPF 648. This enzyme-inhibitor structure can now be used
to develop new inhibitors of highly related human KMO.
We expressed full-length human KMO using the insect cell baculovirus system which
yielded small quantities (0.5 mg/L culture) of detergent-solubilised active KMO. The
recombinant form had similar kinetic constants to native KMO from pig liver
mitochondria25. UPF 648 binds tightly to recombinant KMO (Ki 56.7 nM). Poor stability
and low expression yields however, prevented crystallisation. We therefore turned to
Saccharomyces cerevisiae KMO, which is related to human KMO (38 % identity and 51 %
similarity). Expression of full-length Saccharomyces cerevisiae KMO yielded a protein
fragment (ΔKMO-396Prot) with a lower molecular weight than anticipated. Electrospray
ionisation mass spectrometry indicated proteolytic cleavage at residue 396. Subsequently,
we isolated a ΔKMO-394 (deleted in residues 394 to 460) version of the enzyme engineered
by site-directed mutagenesis (Supplementary Methods) to define the cleavage point prior to
crystallization (Figure S1; Table S1). The ΔKMO-394 enzyme was active (Figure S2, S3),
generated authentic 3HK in HPLC-based assays (Figure 1b) and was inhibited by UPF 648
(Ki 74 nM) with potency similar to that with human KMO (Figure 1b).
The structure of the proteolysed form of yeast KMO (ΔKMO-396Prot) was determined
using selenomethionine single anomalous diffraction (PDB codes 4J2W and 4J31). We also
solved structures of ΔKMO-394 to 1.85 Α̊ resolution. The final model contains residues

1-97 and 101-390 and the bound FAD cofactor. Both crystal forms contain a putative KMO
dimer in the asymmetric unit (Figure 2a). The KMO fold is similar to other flavin-dependent
hydroxylase structures26,27 with highest structural similarity to 2-methyl-3hydroxypyridine-5-carboxylic acid oxygenase28 (rmsd 2.3 Α̊ over 310 Cα, overall sequence
identity 16%, Q score 0.43, Z score 15.0). An overlay of individual KMO monomers reveals
significant variation in the position of the C-terminal α-helix, with most monomers showing
disorder beyond residue 380. The linker region following the second strand of the
antiparallel β-sheet involved in substrate binding is disordered with large variations in the
positions of residues 96-97 and 101-104. The relative position of the FAD-binding domain
and six-stranded antiparallel β-sheet domain is subject to minor variation, reminiscent of
domain motion coupled to substrate binding in other members of this family26.
In absence of substrate, flexibility in relative positioning of both domains flanking the KMO
active site is reflected also in distinct conformations observed for residues lining the active
site (Figure 2c). The re-face of the FAD is connected to solvent by a narrow water-filled
cavity that runs perpendicular to the active site cleft (Figure S4). A structural water is
located above the FAD C4a, mimicking the position of the C4a-peroxide intermediate
formed upon reaction with oxygen. The dimethylbenzene moiety of the FAD isoalloxazine
is protected from solvent by Lys 48 and the conserved residue Tyr 195 (Figure S4). In
absence of large protein rearrangements, this suggests a “waving flavin” motion as
demonstrated in other FAD-dependent mono-oxygenases29 is unlikely to occur in KMO
during turnover.

We were unable to obtain a KMO complex with kynurenine but succeeded in cocrystallising with UPF 648 (Table S3, PDB code 4J36). The asymmetric unit contains a
putative KMO dimer with one monomer containing UPF 648 bound in the active site,
adjacent to the FAD re-face (Figure 2b, Figure 3). The UPF 648 carboxylate is bound by
conserved residues R83 and Y97 while the aromatic dichlorobenzene moiety is flanked by
several hydrophobic residues (L221, M230, I232, L234, F246, P321, and F322), which are
conserved in many KMO enzymes. UPF 648 binding induced structural changes in the
enzyme, notably reorientation of the 321-325 loop flanking the re-side of the FAD. A minor
reorientation in the position of the six-stranded antiparallel β-sheet domain with respect to
the flavin binding domain is also evident. These changes result in increased disorder of the
C-terminal alpha-helix, which is only visible up to R359 (Figure 2b). Reorientation of the
321-325 loop is a consequence of the active site adapting to the presence of vicinal chloride
substituents in UPF 648, neither of which have a counterpart in kynurenine. To provide
sufficient space for both chlorides, F322 moves away from the active site, effectively
occupying a position previously taken by Y323. The P321-Q325 loop reorients to
compensate for the altered F322 position. This loop lines the postulated oxygen binding site
above the re-side of the FAD, which is effectively destroyed on binding UPF 648. Binding
UPF 648 was found to accelerate hydrogen peroxide formation by a factor of ~20-fold
compared to reactions in absence of UPF 648 (Supplementary Methods). This indicates a
destabilisation of the flavin C4a hydroperoxide intermediate formed in the natural catalytic
cycle of flavin monooxygenases in the presence of UPF 648 (Table S2).
The chemical similarity of UPF 648 and kynurenine allowed modelling of kynurenine in the
KMO active site (Supplementary Methods). Modelling suggests kynurenine is bound
similarly, but without effect on the P321-Q325 loop. The aromatic substrate moiety is
located in the conserved hydrophobic pocket (residues L221, M230, I232, L234, F246,
P321, and F322) on the re-face of the flavin (Figure 3). Additional polar contacts are formed
between the conserved Q325 and the kynurenine carbonyl group, and between the substrate
aniline nitrogen and the FAD O4. While the amino acid carboxylate is bound by R83 and
Y97, the amino group is devoid of direct interactions with protein in the model. An

additional salt bridge may be made between the kynurenine amine and the sidechain of Glu
102, which is located in a highly flexible region of KMO. However, this residue is often
replaced by a Gln in other KMOs (Figure S5), suggesting that this interaction is not critical
for enzyme activity. The model places the substrate C3 atom adjacent to the flavin C4a,
where it is poised to attack the flavin C4a peroxide intermediate (Figure 4a).

Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts

All residues implicated by the KMO:kynurenine model as being involved in kynurenine
binding are conserved across KMOs (Figure S5). We validated this model by mutating
residue Arg-83 (replaced by Ala-83 and Met-83) and performing inhibitor binding/kinetic
assays (Figure 4b). Enzyme activity is compromised following mutation (25% and <3% of
wild-type activity for Ala-83 and Met-83 KMOs, respectively) as predicted by the
KMO:kynurenine model. Mutation led to ~20-fold increase in Kd for the KMO-UPF 648
inhibitor complex, which implicates Arg-83 in inhibitor binding.
Elucidation of the KMO crystal structure in free form and in complex with an established
inhibitor is a major breakthrough for new KMO inhibitor design. This will permit docking
screens using virtual compound libraries that may ultimately identify novel inhibitor
scaffolds. Such studies will enable the design of new inhibitors that possess the selectivity
and affinity to open up new opportunities for therapeutic intervention. Critically, this should
inform the development of brain-penetrant KMO inhibitors. The KMO inhibitor Ro 61-8048
and prodrug JM6 have shown preclinical promise in animal models of
neurodegeneration2–4,16–20, but they do not appreciably penetrate the blood-brain barrier.
These compounds likely confer neuroprotection by inhibiting KMO in the blood, and
consequent active transport of kynurenine into the brain, ultimately yielding increased levels
of the neuroprotective metabolite KYNA3,30. As this neuroprotection appears to be
independent of KMO inhibition in the brain, and reduction of downstream neurotoxic
metabolite levels3, delivery of KMO inhibitors directly to the CNS should provide critical
additional therapeutic efficacy and broaden the scope of disorders amenable to targeting.

Crystallization and diffraction data collection

Crystals of Saccharomyes cerevisiae KMO were obtained using the sitting-drop vapour
diffusion technique. Details describing the crystallogenesis can be found in Supplementary
Methods. Diffraction data from Saccharomyes cerevisiae KMO crystals were collected from
single cryofrozen samples at the Diamond Light Source, Harwell, UK. A single-wavelength
anomalous dispersion (SAD) data set at the selenium edge was used for initial phase
determination. Data collection and refinement statistics are present in Table S3.

Cloning, expression and purification of human full-length kynurenine 3-monooxygenase
The gene encoding full length human kynurenine-3-monooxygense was synthesised

Cloning, expression and purification of Saccharomyces cerevisiae kynurenine 3monooxygenase
A synthetic gene (BNA4 UniProtKB accession number P38169) encoding Saccharomyces
cerevisiae kynurenine 3-monooxygenase was ‘codon optimised’ for overexpression in E.
coli (Genescript, Piscataway, NJ, USA). The gene was sub-cloned into pET15b and pET24b
(Merck, Whitehouse Station, NJ, USA) as a Nde I - Xba I fragment for over-expression in E.
coli strain BL21(DE3). A deletion variant of kynurenine 3-monooxygenase (Δ394BNA4)
and single amino acid variants of this deletion (Δ394BNA4-R83A and Δ394BNA4-R83M)
were generated by site-directed mutagenesis (Quikchange, Strategene, Agilent
Technologies, USA). Sense and anti-sense primers are shown in Table S1. Amplification
conditions were: denaturation at 95 °C for 30 s, followed by 16 cycles of amplification at 95
°C (30 s), 55 °C (60 s), 68 °C (7 min). PCR products were incubated for 1 h to digest
methylated template DNA and then transformed into XL1-Blue supercompetent cells
(Stratagene, Agilent Technologies, USA). Transformed bacterial colonies were isolated and
mutated genes were identified by DNA sequencing (MWG Eurofins) to verify presence of
desired, and lack of spurious changes, to the DNA sequence.

Transformed bacterial cells were grown overnight at 37 °C in Lysogeny Broth (LB; 0.75 L)
containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin. Cultures were grown at 37 °C to optical density ~0.3, and
the temperature was then reduced to 27 °C. Cells were induced (0.1 mM isopropyl β-Dthiogalactopyranoside; IPTG) and grown (16-20 h) at 27 °C. Cells were lysed in buffer A
(20 mM potassium phosphate, buffer pH 7.5, 10% glycerol, 300 mM NaCl, 50 μM FAD)
containing protease inhibitors. Soluble lysate was loaded onto a 5 mL HisTrap FF Ni
Sepharose 6 Fast Flow column (GE Healthcare) pre-equilibrated with buffer A. Protein was
eluted using a 50 – 250 mM imidazole linear gradient. Yellow fractions containing partially
purified KMO were pooled and diluted 10 times in buffer B (20 mM potassium phosphate
buffer, pH 7.5, 10% glycerol, 7mM 2-mercaptoethanol) to reduce salt and imidazole
concentration. Protein was subsequently loaded onto 10 mL blue Sepharose 6 fast flow
column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated with buffer B. The protein was eluted using a linear
gradient to 2.5 M NaCl prepared in buffer B. Fractions containing KMO were pooled and
diluted 10-fold in buffer B to reduce the NaCl concentration. Protein was concentrated and
chromatographed using a Superdex 200 10/300 GL column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated
with buffer C (25 mM ammonium acetate buffer, pH 7.0, 150 mM NaCl, 7 mM 2mercaptoethanol). Pure fractions were collected and stored at −80 °C.
Incorporation of selenomethionine into yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae KMO
Expression of selenomethione labelled protein was achieved by inhibiting methionine
biosynthesis shortly before induction of KMO expression by adding high concentrations of
isoleucine, leucine, phenylalanine, lysine and threonine to the cell culture. Transformed E.
coli cells containing the Saccharomyces cerevisiae KMO expression plasmid were grown in
LB media at 37 °C to late exponential phase, harvested and then re-suspended in M9
minimal media and grown until mid-log phase. At that point lysine, phenylalanine, threonine
(100 mg/l each), and selenomethionine, isoleucine, leucine, and valine (50 mg/l each) were
added to the culture and induced 15 min after addition of amino acids with 0.1 mM IPTG.
The culture was grown for 12-16 hours. Purification of selenomethionine incorporated

Enzyme Assays

Steady-state kinetic parameters for kynurenine 3-monooxygenase were obtained by initial
rate measurements of enzyme activity. KMO catalyses the NADPH-dependent
hydroxylation of L-kynurenine to 3-hydroxykynurenine and the enzymatic reaction can be
monitored by following the decrease in absorbance of NADPH at 340 nm. Rate assays were
carried out with 1 cm path length quartz microcuvette at 37 °C for human KMO and 30 °C
for Saccharomyces cereviseae KMO. Pure enzyme (0.2 - 1μM) was added to 200 μl
reaction buffer (20 mM potassium phosphate buffer, pH 8.0, 7 mM 2-mercaptoethanol)
containing different concentrations of NADPH and L-kynurenine (Sigma-Aldrich
Corporation) and the time-dependent absorbance change at 340 nm was recorded using a
using a UV-vis Cary Eclipse spectrophotometer (Agilent Technologies). Assays at each
reaction condition were performed in triplicate. Apparent Michaelis constants, Km, for Lkynurenine and NADPH were determined by varying the concentration of the first substrate
at a constant concentration of the second substrate and vice versa. Reaction data were fitted
to the standard Michaelis-Menten equation using Origin Software (OriginLab, Northampton,
MA).

KMO inhibition by UPF 648 was measured by following formation of the product 3
hydroxykynurenine by C18 reversed-phase HPLC. Enzyme (100 nM) was incubated at 37 °C
in 1 mL reaction buffer (20 mM potassium phosphate buffer, pH 8.5, 7 mM 2mercaptoethanol) with 2 mM NADPH, 500 μM L-kynurenine and different concentrations
(0 – 2 μM) of UPF 468. The reaction was stopped with 8 % trifluoracetic acid added at
different time points during the assay. Precipitated protein was removed by centrifugation,
and the supernatant was analysed by C18 reversed-phase HPLC equilibrated with 50 mM
ammonium acetate, pH 3.0, containing 1% methanol and 0.1% heptanesulfonic acid; elution
from the column was with 50 mM ammonium acetate, pH 4.5, containing 5% methanol and
0.5% heptanesulfonic acid, and monitored at 229 nm. 3-hydroxykynurenine was quantified
by comparison with a 3-hydroxykynurenine calibration curve. Each experiment was
performed in triplicate. Data were fitted to the Morrison equation (Equation 1):

concentration I, [E] is the enzyme concentration, [I] is the inhibitor concentration and Ki is

Ligand binding assays
Fluorescence emission measurements were performed using a Cary Eclipse Fluorimeter
(Agilent Technologies) to determine enzyme-ligand dissociation constants (Kd) for KMO
ligands, exploiting ligand perturbation of flavin (enzyme-bound FAD) fluorescence.
Excitation light was provided from a xenon light source and excitation and emission slit
widths were 5 nm. The perturbation in FAD fluorescence emission was followed at 520 nm
using an excitation wavelength of 450 nm and excitation spectra were recorded from 470 to
700 nm. L-kyn and UPF 648 were titrated into a 5 μM solution of KMO (20 mM potassium
phosphate buffer, pH 8, 50 mM NaCl and 7 mM 2-mercaptoethanol) at 25 °C. Dissociation
constants, Kd, were calculated by fitting data for the difference in fluorescence emission
measured for KMO-ligand complexes and free KMO at 520 nm divided by the maximum
emission versus the ligand concentration (Equation 2). This equation is a variation of

Hydrogen peroxide quantification
Measurements to observe the formation of hydrogen peroxide from the ΔKMO-394-UPF
inhibitor complex were performed using a horseradish peroxidase (HRP) assay. Steady-state
assays were performed as described above to calculate the NADPH consumption rate in the
presence and absence of an excess of UPF 648 (30 μM). KMO (5 μM) was incubated with
150 μM NADPH, 150 μM L-KYN, 400 μM o-dianisidine and ~5 units HRP in the presence
and absence of excess UPF 648. The rate of oxidation of o-dianisidine by H2O2, catalysed
by HRP, was monitored at 440 nm (Δε =11.600M−1cm−1 440 ). The rate of hydrogen
peroxide production was compared to the rate of NADPH consumption.
Crystallisation of Saccharomyces cerevisiae KMO

Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts

Initial crystals of Saccharomyces cerevisiae KMO (ΔKMO-396Prot & ΔKMO-396Prot-Se)
were obtained by mixing 200 nl of 14 mg/ml protein in 20 mM ammonium acetate, pH 7.0,
150 mM NaCl and 7 mM 2-mercaptoethanol (buffer A) with 200 nl of a reservoir solution
containing 0.1 M sodium acetate, pH 5.5, and 35 % isopropanol. A second, more readily
reproducible crystal form was obtained with ΔKMO-394 and ΔKMO–394-HIS−. In both
cases crystals were grown by mixing 200 nl of protein (buffer A) with 200 nl of a reservoir
solution containing 0.1 M imidazole, pH 7.8, and 11 % w/v polyethylene glycol 8K. The
UPF complex (ΔKMO-394-UPF) was also obtained as described above; however, prior to
setting the trays the protein was pre-incubated with 1 mM UPF for ~30 minutes. All trays
were incubated at 277 K, with crystals forming over a period of ~72 h.
Diffraction data processing, structure determination and refinement
X-ray diffraction data were collected at Diamond Light Source and subsequently integrated
and scaled using the program XDS31. Initial phases were obtained from a single SAD data
set (S1) collected at the selenium edge. Selenium sites were located using Phenix AutoSol32
yielding an electron density map that could be auto traced using Phenix AutoBuild33. The
resulting model was completed through iterative rounds of rebuilding in COOT34 and
refinement in Phenix35. All subsequent structures were solved by molecular replacement in
PHASER36 using this initial SeMet derived structure as the template. Structure validation
with MOLPROBITY37 was integrated as part of the iterative rebuild and refinement
procedure.
KMO-kynurenine modeling
NAMD software38 was used to perform all molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of the
kynurenine-KMO complex. Topology and parameters files for substrate and FAD were
obtained using Antechamber program39 using AM1-BCC charges40. The complex model

was then immersed in a periodic water box (TIP3) and neutralized by adding Na+ ions.
Several cycles of minimizations (steepest descent, 10 000 steps) and MD simulations (50K,
20 ps) were performed to equilibrate the model (backbone protein atoms were kept fixed).
Then MD simulations were performed (310 K, 1 ns) at a time step of 2 ps, with the protein
backbone restrained on the X-ray structure conformation. Individual snapshots were
extracted and minimized to assess the KMO-kynurenine interactions.

Panel A. The proposed KMO kynurenine hydroxylation mechanism based on the
Saccharomyces cerevisiae KMO:kynurenine model. Following hydroxylation, the
intermediate rearranges to form the 3-hydroxyl kynurenine product. Panel B. Enzymatic
activity comparison between wild type KMO and R83 mutants. Enzyme activity is
significantly reduced following mutation (< 29% and < 1% of wild-type activity for Ala-83
and Met-83 KMOs). Inset: Measurement of binding constant for KMO inhibitor UPF 648 by
ligand perturbation of flavin fluorescence emission. Titration of UPF 648 to 5 μM wild type
KMO (closed squares), R83M (closed triangles) and R83A (closed circles) mutants resulted
in perturbation of 520 nm fluorescence emission. Fluorescence changes at 520 nm as
function of UPF 648 concentration fitted to the Morrison equation yields an observed KD=
137.8 ± 8 nMfor wild type, KD= 3.1± 0.2 μM for R83M and KD= 3.2 ± 0.2 μM for R83A
enzymes. Error bars represent the standard deviation of three replica points.

Dissociation constant (KD) for the human KMO-UPF 648 complex could not be determined by fluorescence emission due to low KMO

expression yield.

2

Kinetic assays to calculate the inhibition (Ki app) of ScKMO variants by UPF648 could not be carried out because enzyme activity was

substantially compromised following mutagenesis. As an alternative, fluorescence emission measurements were performed to determine
dissociation constants (KD) by ligand perturbation of flavin fluorescence.
