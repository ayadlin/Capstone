Abstract
Tumor hypoxia is associated with resistance to antiangiogenic therapy and poor prognosis. The Siah E3
ubiquitin ligases regulate the hypoxic response pathway by modulating the turnover of the master proangiogenic
transcription factor hypoxia-inducible factor-1a (Hif-1a). In this study, we show that genetic deﬁciency in the
Siah family member Siah2 results in vascular normalization and delayed tumor growth in an established
transgenic model of aggressive breast cancer. Tumors arising in a Siah2/ genetic background showed increased
perfusion and pericyte-associated vasculature, similar to that occurring with antiangiogenic therapy. In support
of the role of Siah2 in regulating levels of Hif-1a, expression of angiogenic factors was decreased in Siah2/
tumors. Blood vessel normalization in Siah2/ tumors resulted in an increased response to chemotherapy and
prolonged survival. Together, our ﬁndings offer a preclinical proof of concept that targeting Siah2 is sufﬁcient to
attenuate Hif-1a–mediated angiogenesis and hypoxia signaling, thereby improving responses to chemotherapy.

Introduction
Angiogenesis in solid tumors is the result of the complex
interplay between several signaling pathways in the epithelial
and stromal fractions of tumors, which is triggered by an
increased demand for oxygen in the growing tumor. Given the
importance of the expansion of the vasculature in tumor
growth and metastasis, antiangiogenic therapy is regarded to
be a key approach to molecular-based cancer therapy (1). Early
work showed that VEGF-speciﬁc antibodies reduced tumor
growth and angiogenesis in 3 cancer models (2). Bevacizumab
(Avastin), a neutralizing humanized monoclonal antibody
against VEGF, and VEGF receptor (VEGFR) inhibitors including sunitinib (Sutent) and sorafenib (Nexavar), are approved
treatments for several cancers (3). VEGF and VEGFR inhibition
transforms the morphology of tumor blood vessel from tortuAuthors' Afﬁliations: 1Cancer Genomics and Genetics; 2Translational

ous and leaky to pericyte covered and elongated (1). However,
resistance to antiangiogenic treatment frequently occurs, with
tumors resuming growth despite VEGF or VEGFR inhibition
(4). The proposed reasons for tumor escape from treatment
include upregulation of alternate angiogenic molecules (either
acquired or preexisting), recruitment of proangiogenic cells
from the bone marrow, or tumor cell invasion along existing
vascular networks (5). An important experimental insight into
escape from antiangiogenic therapy comes from a mouse
model of pancreatic tumors treated with anti-VEGF antibodies
(6). The tumors that evade the blockade of the VEGF pathway to
induce angiogenesis upregulate several other proangiogenic
growth factors, including ﬁbroblast growth factor (FGF), platelet—derived growth factor (PDGF), and angiopoietins (Ang;
ref. 6). The induction of these proangiogenic factors has been
attributed to the cellular response to hypoxia (6).
Cells adapt to a hypoxic environment through upregulation
of hypoxia-inducible factor-1a (Hif-1a), which together with
the constitutively expressed Hif-1b protein, forms the Hif-1
transcription factor (7). Hif-1a protein turnover is controlled
largely through covalent protein modiﬁcation, including
hydroxylation by prolyl-hydroxylases (PHD-1, -2, and -3) on
Pro402 and Pro564 (8). The hydroxylated Hif-1a has increased
afﬁnity for the E3 ubiquitin–protein ligase complex, which is
composed of the von Hippel–Lindau tumor suppressor protein
VHL, elongin B and C, and cullin. After polyubiquitination, Hif1a is degraded by the 26S proteasome (8). Under hypoxia, Hif1a hydroxylation decreases due to reduced PHD abundance
and activity (8). We and others have shown that Siah proteins
polyubiquitinate PHDs under hypoxic conditions (9, 10), thereby targeting them for proteasomal degradation and allowing
unmodiﬁed Hif-1a protein to dimerize with Hif-1b. The role of

Siah2 Controls Neoangiogenesis and Responses to Chemotherapy

Siah proteins in tumor progression is becoming clearer (11–13).
Previously, we described that the loss of Siah2 reduces the
occurrence of aggressive neuroendocrine tumors and metastasis of prostate adenocarcinoma (14) and Siah2 is required for
melanoma metastasis through Hif-1 (15). Furthermore, a dominant negative version of Siah blocks oncogenic Ras signaling,
thereby reducing pancreatic and lung tumor growth (16, 17).
We have previously described that inhibition of Siah2 by using a
high afﬁnity blocking peptide that binds to its substrate recognition domain can reduce growth and vascular development
of tumors in a syngeneic and orthotopic breast cancer mouse
model (18). Importantly, we have shown that clinically, Siah2
protein expression is speciﬁcally increased in triple negative,
basal-like breast cancer (19). Here, we explore the growth and
vascularization of breast cancer in Siah2/ mice in a Polyoma
Middle T (PyMT) transgenic background. We show that tumor
growth is delayed in PyMT-Siah2/ animals. End-stage
tumors show reduced angiogenic factor expression, as well as
a vascular morphology resembling that seen following
anti-VEGF treatment. We observe higher perfusion of PyMTSiah2/ tumors, which are more sensitive to doxorubicinbased chemotherapy. Our ﬁndings are the ﬁrst to explore the
effect of targeting the upstream regulator of the hypoxic
response, Siah2, as an antitumoral strategy to achieve increased
efﬁcacy of conventional chemotherapy in an immune competent mouse model of cancer. This work has important implications for the utility of targeting this upstream regulator of
hypoxia, angiogenesis, and tumor cell survival.

Materials and Methods
Animals
PyMT-Siah2/ and PyMT-WT mice were generated by
crossing C57Bl/6 Siah2/ mice (20) with C57Bl/6 PyMTtransgenic mice (kindly provided by Carol MacLeod and Lionel
Hebbard, University of California, San Diego, San Diego, CA).
All procedures involving mice were conducted in accordance with NHMRC regulations on the use and care of experimental animals and were approved by the Peter MacCallum
Cancer Centre Animal Ethics Committee.
Measurement of tumor size
Mammary glands were palpated every other day, and once
apparent, the size of individual tumors measured with digital
calipers. Mice were culled when the tumor volume for all the
tumors in a mouse reached a total of 525 mm3 (end-stage).
Tumor volume was calculated as (p  length  width2/6).
Dissection and tissue extraction
Mice were culled and weighed, then the tumor dissected and
fractioned for further extraction of mRNA and protein, as well
as for histology [fresh frozen and 10% neutral-buffered formalin (NBF) ﬁxation]. Whole tissue samples of the mammary
gland, lung, liver, spleen, and spine were prepared in 10% NBF.
Primary cell isolation, cell culture
PyMT-positive cell lines were generated as published (21),
then further puriﬁed for the tumor epithelial population by
ﬂuorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) using EpCAM anti-

www.aacrjournals.org

bodies (eBioscience). The epithelial lineage of established lines
was conﬁrmed by FACS with EpCAM antibodies. Cell culture
was done as previously described (18).
Transplantable tumor model
A total of 5  105 PyMT-positive primary or established
cultured cell lines were injected into the fourth left mammary
fat pad of each recipient. The mice were then monitored at
least twice weekly and tumor progression recorded.
Mammary fat pad staining
Third and fourth left and right mammary glands were
carefully removed en bloc, laid ﬂat, ﬁxed, stained with Carmine
Red, and cleared in xylene.
Immunohistochemistry and immunoﬂuorescence
Serial sections were obtained from formalin-ﬁxed, parafﬁnembedded (FFPE) or optimal cutting temperature (fresh frozen)-imbedded tissues. Staining was done with antibodies for
CD31 (BD Biosciences Pharmingen; 550274), NG2 (Millipore;
AB5320), and smooth muscle actin (SMA, Dako; M0851)
according to manufacturers' instructions and as described
(18). Texas-red dextran injections were done as described
(22). Pimonidazole (PIM) staining was carried out as described
(23). Determination of CD31/NG2 colocalization and CD31/
PIM minimum distances was done with Metamorph software
in a semiautomated manner. Three to 4 random ﬁelds of view
per tumor were analyzed. Proliferation and apoptosis were
assessed by proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA, BD
Biosciences; 610665) and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase–mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL; Chemicon)
according to manufacturers' instructions. The positively
stained cells were counted in 5 ﬁelds per mammary gland and
expressed as percentage of total cells present.
Flow cytometric analysis
Third and fourth left and right mammary glands or endstage tumors were dissected, minced, and then subjected to
collagenase digestion before staining with APC-CD45, PE-F4/
80, and PE-Cy7-CD11b antibodies before resuspension in FACS
buffer containing 2% FBS and 1/100 dilution of 7-aminoactinomycin D (7-AAD). The samples were analyzed on a BD
FACSCanto II Loader machine.
Angiogenesis arrays, TIF
Tumor interstitial ﬂuid (TIF) was prepared as described (24).
TIFs were then probed with mouse angiogenesis antibody
proteome proﬁler array from R&D Systems according to
manufacturer's instructions.
Western blotting
Cells were treated, as indicated, lysed, and analyzed by
Western blotting as previously described (18).
mRNA extraction and qPCR
mRNA from cells or tissues was isolated by QiaShredder
(Qiagen) and RNeasy (Qiagen) kits according to the manufacturers' instructions.

Small animal PET and ultrasound

FAZA tracer was synthesized and labeled in a dedicated inhouse radiochemistry facility and injected into mice with 65
mm3 tumors in their third mammary gland. Three hours
postinjection mice were imaged on a prototype A-PET (Phillips
Mosaic) small animal positron emission tomography (PET)
scanner as described (25). A high-resolution small animal
ultrasound system (Visualsonics, Inc.) was used to examine
tumor vasculature and perfusion. In the 3-dimensional power
Doppler acquisition mode, 2-dimensional images were
acquired in 100-mm increments across the tumor and images
stacked to produce a 3-dimensional representation of the
tumor. Percentage of vasculature was then calculated as the
ratio of the number of colored voxels within the tumor volume
and the total number of voxels within the same volume.
Perfusion was evaluated in the centre slice of the tumor using
a destruction/replenishment technique using microbubbles as
described previously (26).
Clonogenic survival assay
Cells were treated with a range of doxorubicin concentrations for the indicated times before counting and plating. Cells
were ﬁxed, stained, and colonies of more than 50 cells were
counted.
Determination of doxorubicin concentrations in tumors
8 PyMT-WT tumor-bearing wild-type (WT) mice and 8
PyMT-Siah2/ tumor-bearing Siah2/ mice with tumor
volumes of 525 mm3 were injected with 5 mg/kg doxorubicin
3 hours before sacriﬁce. Doxorubicin concentration in tumors
was measured ﬂuorimetrically using an adaptation of the
method described previously (27). Frozen tumors were cut
into 3 parts and each slice extracted in 3 mL/0.75 mol/L HCl/
isopropanol per gram of frozen tissue, using metal beads and a
FastPrep 24 homogenising unit (MP Biomedicals; 4  30
seconds homogenization). Samples were clariﬁed by centrifugation at 14,000  g for 5 minutes and doxorubicin concentration in the supernatant measured using a POLARstar ﬂuorimeter, with excitation at 480 nm and emission at 610 nm.
Background ﬂuorescence from tumors without doxorubicin
was subtracted from all values. Doxorubicin concentrations
were converted to nanograms doxorubicin per gram of frozen
tissue.
Doxorubicin treatment of mice
Mice were tail vein injected twice weekly for 4 weeks with the
indicated doses when tumors reached 65 mm3. Animal weight
and tumor dimensions were assessed as described above.
Animals were culled when tumors reached 525 mm3.

Results
Loss of Siah2 delays tumor onset
We investigated the impact of Siah2 in breast cancer progression by generating mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV)PyMT transgenic mice on a Siah2/ background. Loss of Siah2
resulted in a signiﬁcantly increased time to tumor onset
compared with PyMT-WT animals (PyMT-WT, 81 days of age;

1696

Cancer Res; 72(7) April 1, 2012

PyMT-Siah2/, 121 days of age; P < 0.001; Fig. 1A). To
determine whether this delay can also be seen at earlier stages,
we next examined the mammary glands of mice before the
onset of palpable tumors. Mammary gland whole mounts (Fig.
1B and Supplementary Fig. S1A, S1C, and S1E) and histologic
analyses (Fig. 1C and Supplementary Fig. S1B and S1D) of 30-,
50-, and 70-day-old mice revealed that the difference in tumor
progression had already manifested at 50 days of age. The
mammary glands of PyMT-Siah2/ mice showed similar
tumor progression to PyMT-WT animals but the effects were
delayed by more than 3 weeks (Fig. 1B; graph). Therefore,
PyMT-Siah2/ mice at 90 days of age resembled PyMT-WT
mice of 70 days of age with regard to tumor burden and
histologic staging (Supplementary Fig. S1E compared with
Supplementary Fig. S1C, left). To determine whether the
differences in tumor onset could be associated with altered
mammary development in a Siah2/ background, we examined mammary fat pad morphology in young PyMT-negative
animals from both Siah2 genotypes. The timing of formation,
number, and morphology of the ductal tree was indistinguishable between Siah2/ and wild-type animals (Supplementary
Fig. S2), suggesting that the delayed onset of tumor formation
in mice was not a consequence of altered mammary
development.
While there was a trend toward longer time to ethically
allowed end point (525 mm3) in Siah2/ mice, this was not
statistically signiﬁcant (P ¼ 0.36; Fig. 1D). Although initially
delayed, once tumors became palpable in Siah2/ animals,
they grew rapidly (Fig. 1E). These data suggest that the initial
delay of tumor growth initiation in PyMT-Siah2/ mice is
associated with early events in tumor development but
compensatory changes allow accelerated growth of the
tumor.
Reduced stromal inﬁltration in Siah2/ breast tumors
Tumors in PyMT-WT mice were typically ﬂuid or blood
ﬁlled, had a high degree of stromal inﬁltration and large areas
of necrosis (Fig. 2A). Tumors from PyMT-Siah2/ mice were
strikingly different, consisting of large epithelial sheets, very
little ﬁbroblast inﬁltration, and minimal necrosis (Fig. 2A).
SMA, a marker of ﬁbroblasts and pericytes (28, 29), stained
large areas of stromal tissue in PyMT-WT tumors, whereas
PyMT-Siah2/ tumors displayed greatly reduced staining
(Fig. 2B and Supplementary Fig. S3).
To investigate the basis of the difference in tumor development in the PyMT-Siah2/ animals, we ﬁrst assessed PyMTderived oncogenic signaling in cells isolated from mammary
glands of 30-day-old PyMT-WT and PyMT-Siah2/ mice.
There was a similar level of PyMT gene expression in both
genotypes (Supplementary Fig. S4A). PyMT expression
induces, among other responses, the phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (Erk; ref. 30). The levels of
phosphorylated Erk varied between mammary glands isolated
from different 30-day-old PyMT-WT and PyMT-Siah2/
animals but there was no obvious difference between the 2
genotypes (Supplementary Fig. S4B). We also observed
no difference in the rates of apoptosis or proliferation in
mammary glands from 50- and 70-day-old mice as well as in

end-stage tumors (Supplementary Fig. S4C–S4F). Siah2 is a
member of the Siah ubiquitin ligase family, which also includes
Siah1A and Siah1B in mice. To assess whether the loss of Siah2
function in the PyMT-Siah2/ mice was compensated for by
increased expression of either Siah1A or Siah1B, thus enabling
tumor progression, the expression of these genes was examined in early mammary lesions and end-stage tumors.
We observed no difference in the expression of these 2 genes
in primary epithelial cells of 30-day-old PyMT-Siah2/ and
PyMT-WT mice or end point tumors (Supplementary Fig. S4G

Normalized tumor vasculature in PyMT-Siah2/ mice
We previously observed changes in the vasculature of syngeneic tumors in the presence of Siah substrate–binding
inhibitors (18). We therefore analyzed the vasculature in
end-stage tumors from both genotypes. While we observed
no difference in the overall amount of CD31-positive vessels in
the tumors (Fig. 3A and Supplementary Fig. S5A, data not
shown), the vessels of PyMT-Siah2/ tumors appeared less
tortuous and possessed slimmer lumen (Fig. 3A and Supplementary Fig. S5A). We therefore investigated the coverage of
the vessels by pericytes. Consistent with previous reports

(1, 31), we observed modest colocalization of pericytes with
endothelial cells in PyMT-WT tumors (Fig. 3B and Supplementary Fig. S5B). In contrast, PyMT-Siah2/ tumors showed
signiﬁcantly more pericyte coverage of endothelial cells (Fig.
3B and Supplementary Fig. S5B), which is characteristic of
more mature vessels (1).
To examine whether these different vessel phenotypes are
functionally diverse, we injected Texas-red dextran into the
blood stream of tumor-bearing mice. By this method, only
blood-carrying vessels are labeled (22). PyMT-Siah2/
tumors contain signiﬁcantly more blood-carrying vessels
compared with PyMT-WT tumors in both spontaneous and
transplanted tumor models (Fig. 3C, data not shown). To
further corroborate this observation, blood ﬂow and perfusion was assessed by high resolution 3-dimensional power
Doppler ultrasound (32). For this experiment, single large
tumors are required, rather than multiple foci occurring in
the spontaneous model. Therefore, tumor cells derived from
PyMT-WT and PyMT-Siah2/ mice were injected into the
fourth mammary fat pad of syngeneic mice (named PyMTWT/WT and PyMT-Siah2//KO, respectively). Tumors generated this way recapitulated the angiogenic, pericyte, and
stromal inﬁltration phenotypes observed in the spontaneous
model (data not shown). In tumors of similar size (150
mm3, Fig. 3D), PyMT-Siah2//KO tumors had a signiﬁcantly increased percentage of functional, blood-containing vasculature compared with those in PyMT-WT/WT tumors
(Fig. 3E). Furthermore, using replenishment kinetics following an ultrasound-induced destruction of microbubbles, we
observed signiﬁcantly elevated perfusion of the PyMTSiah2//KO tumors (Fig. 3F).

1698

Cancer Res; 72(7) April 1, 2012

To assess whether increased tumor perfusion impacted on
tumor-associated hypoxia, PyMT-WT and PyMT-Siah2/
tumors were investigated by small animal PET using the
hypoxia tracer 18FAZA. PyMT-Siah2/ tumors showed a trend
toward reduced hypoxia (Fig. 4A, P ¼ 0.09). The tissue localization of hypoxic areas was visualized using the hypoxia
marker pimonidazole, which accumulates preferentially in
areas of limited perfusion (25, 33). Costaining with pimonidazole and the vascular marker CD31 showed that in PyMTSiah2/ tumors, hypoxia was restricted to regions that were
predominantly distant from blood vessels (Fig. 4B and Supplementary Fig. S6A). In contrast, signiﬁcantly more regions of
hypoxia associated with blood vessels in PyMT-WT tumors,
consistent with the poor functional properties and transient
occlusion, associated with the vasculature of many solid
cancers (Fig. 4B and Supplementary Fig. S6; refs. 34, 35).
Therefore, whereas the overall number of CD31-positive
endothelial cells is similar in PyMT-Siah2/ and PyMT-WT
tumors, tumors developing in PyMT-Siah2/ mice contain
more functional vessels, resulting in increased perfusion in
both early and end-stage tumors.
Reduced proangiogenic growth factor production by
PyMT-Siah2/ tumors
We next aimed to determine the causes for the difference in
neoangiogenesis in PyMT-Siah2/ tumors. Hif-1–dependent
angiogenesis results in the recruitment of blood vessels from
existing vasculature (22), thus allowing rapid tumor growth.
Siah2 controls the abundance of the Hif-1a transcription factor
(9). Accordingly, Hif-1a–positive cells in end-stage tumors
were lower in PyMT-Siah2/ mice than in PyMT-WT mice
(Fig. 4C). Hif-1a is responsible for the induction of a wide range
of proangiogenic factors, including VEGF and angiopoietins
(36), and the phenotypes observed earlier suggest that the loss
of Siah2 in tumor cells causes an angiogenic normalization
phenotype similar to VEGF inhibition. We therefore assessed
the levels of VEGF and the VEGF receptors, Kdr (VEGFR2) and
Flt1 (VEGFR1), as well as several FGFs and angiopoietin
expression in the 2 tumor genotypes by qPCR. Expression of
these proangiogenic factors was either similar in both tumor
genotypes or signiﬁcantly reduced in PyMT-Siah2/ tumors
(Fig. 4D). These results showed that the previously described
hypoxia response–dependent proangiogenic pathway is largely

vessel formation, we used a proteomic approach to screen
for angiogenic factors secreted at elevated levels into the TIF
by PyMT-Siah2/ tumors. We found variations between
amounts and composition of angiogenic factors secreted from
tumors of the same genotype, attributable to the heterogeneity
of this model (37). However, we found that PyMT-WT TIFs
derived from both small (volume, 65 mm3) and end-stage
tumors consistently contained elevated levels of angiopoietin
1 (A6), CXCL16 (A9), CCN1 (B2), FGF-1 (B9), CCN3 (D11), and
PTX3 (E6; Fig. 4E and Supplementary Fig. S5C and Supplementary Table S1). We furthermore conﬁrmed that several
factors, including FGF-1 (B9) and angiopoietin 1 (A6), which
we found to be downregulated on a gene expression level in

due to reduced macrophage inﬁltration causing changes to the

To test whether the increased perfusion in the PyMTSiah2/ tumors is associated with enhanced sensitivity to
chemotherapy, we ﬁrst assessed the sensitivity of PyMT-WT

survival of PyMT-WT and PyMT-Siah2/ cells in the presence
of various doxorubicin concentrations is similar (113.9 nmol/L
for PyMT-WT cells compared with 107.2 nmol/L for PyMTSiah2/ cells; Fig. 5A), showing that cells of both genotypes
have similar sensitivity to doxorubicin in vitro. To measure
whether the vascular normalization described earlier results in
elevated tumor concentrations of chemotherapeutics in vivo,
doxorubicin was intravenously injected into tumor-bearing
mice 3 hours before determining drug concentrations. We
found that doxorubicin concentrations in PyMT-Siah2/
tumors are approximately 120% higher than in PyMT-WT
tumors (Fig. 5B). To assess whether the different drug concentrations results in changed efﬁcacy of doxorubicin on
established orthotopic tumors in the fourth mammary glands,
PyMT-WT and PyMT-Siah2/ tumors were grown to 65 mm3
then twice weekly treatment of doxorubicin was commenced.

PyMT-WT/WT tumors grew steadily, reaching 250 mm3 within
30 days (Fig. 5C). The treatment of PyMT-Siah2//KO tumorbearing animals with doxorubicin resulted in stable tumor
sizes that are signiﬁcantly smaller than in the PyMT-WT/WT
group (Fig. 5C). After cessation of the treatment, we followed
the tumor growth until end-stage (525 mm3) and observed
signiﬁcantly prolonged survival of PyMT-Siah2//KO mice
after treatment with doxorubicin compared with PyMT-WT/
WT mice (Fig. 5D; P < 0.05). Collectively, these data show that
the increased perfusion of PyMT-Siah2/ tumors results in a
signiﬁcantly elevated efﬁcacy of doxorubicin despite similar
resistance of PyMT-Siah2/ tumor cells in vitro.

Discussion
Malignant tumor progression past an initial "avascular
phase" requires new blood vessel formation once the tumor
grows beyond 500 mm in diameter (38). Hypoxia is a key
driver in the neoangiogenic process required to form a new
but inefﬁcient tumor-associated vasculature network (39).
While no single protein seems to be the master regulator of
neoangiogenesis, the loss or inhibition of VEGF or its kinase
receptors (VEGFRs) results in a normalization of the tumor
vasculature. As a normalized vasculature would lead to more
efﬁcient delivery of blood through tumor-associated vessels,
antiangiogenic therapy might result in higher sensitivity of
tumors to standard chemotherapy (40). This prediction has
since been veriﬁed in animal models in which VEGF or
VEGFR function has been attenuated. More recently, antiVEGF treatment of patients with glioblastoma has been
associated with improved tumor perfusion and enhanced
survival (41). Antiangiogenic therapy through EGFR inhibition with erlotinib was also shown to result in increased
sensitivity toward chemo- and radiotherapy (42). Similarly,
we ﬁnd in this study that the loss of Siah2 results in vascular
normalization, increased tumor perfusion, and elevated
sensitivity to doxorubicin-based chemotherapy (summarized in the schematic in Fig. 5E).
Although blocking proteins downstream of Hif-1a, such as
VEGF, is an attractive therapeutic approach, the clinical
success of antiangiogenic therapies has been limited. Hif-1
regulates a wider range of responses that allow cancer cells
to survive in hypoxic environments and it seems that targeting just a subset of these allows the emergence of bypass
mechanisms and restoration of tumor growth (6). In addition, inhibition of single Hif-1 targets may leave other
hypoxic responses, such as metastatic spread, uncontrolled
or enhanced, with unintended consequences for patients (43,
44). For these reasons, targeting the Hif-1a protein directly
represents a promising approach that should be explored in
more detail.
As a transcription factor, targeting Hif-1 activity directly is
difﬁcult and most drugs that inhibit Hif-1a activity do so by
altering other signaling pathway components that inﬂuence
Hif-1a stability (8). In addition, some chemotherapeutic drugs,
including doxorubicin, have been shown to block Hif-1 DNA
binding and therefore act as Hif-1a inhibitors (8). In this study,
we have explored an alternative pathway of inhibiting hypoxic

1702

Cancer Res; 72(7) April 1, 2012

response signaling by genetic targeting of the Siah2 ubiquitin
ligase, which regulates the abundance of PHD proteins under
hypoxia and therefore the stabilization of Hif-1a (9). In contrast to the inhibition of downstream proteins of the hypoxic
response pathway, we do not observe the upregulation of
alternate proangiogenic molecules or the recruitment of
proangiogenic cell lineages. Despite this, Siah2/ tumors start
growing after an initial delay. It is possible that this initial delay
in tumor growth represents a delayed induction of the angiogenic switch in these tumors or that the resulting vascular
normalization phenotype in Siah2/ tumors represents a
stage similar to that of normal angiogenesis of organs during
development. Alternatively, other proangiogenic factors,
which we did not detect in our approaches, might be in part
responsible for the differential timing of angiogenesis in
Siah2/ tumors. Importantly, macrophages have previously
been shown in the PyMT-driven mouse model to be essential
contributors of proangiogenic proteins to the tumor microenvironment and the ablation of macrophages results in a
delayed angiogenic switch (22). While we ﬁnd no differences in
macrophage inﬁltration into the Siah2/ tumors at early or
late stages, further work will deﬁne whether Siah2 plays a role
in angiogenic factor production in macrophages. With the
close resemblance to that seen in human disease, including
molecular pathway activation (i.e., Ras, PI3K, and Src signaling;
refs. 45–47) and biomarker expression (37), the PyMT-driven
breast cancer model can assist in the future to further deﬁne
the various roles of Siah2 in breast cancer progression.
Our ﬁndings, that the loss of Siah2 results in increased
tumor perfusion through vascular normalization, are in
accordance with previous work from our group and others
showing that blockade of Siah substrate binding (14, 15, 18)
and dominant negative Siah proteins (16, 17) have tumor
inhibiting properties in various cancer models. Siah inhibitors can be expected to inhibit several protumoral
responses, in addition to the hypoxic response pathway
(48), including Ras (16, 17, 49), estrogen receptors (50, 51),
and DNA damage signaling networks (13, 52). Inhibition of
Siah has been linked to Hif-1a–dependent and -independent
mechanisms (15, 17). However, untangling the relative contribution of inhibition to each of these pathways to attenuation of tumor growth is challenging (12).
We have previously generated the peptide-based Siah inhibitor PHYL (18, 53), which required stable expression in tumor
cells. Because of its peptide nature, it is not suitable for
assessing the systemic effect of Siah blockade on tumor
progression. Recently, vitamin K3 has been reported as an
inhibitor of Siah ubiquitin ligases, although with reasonably
low afﬁnity (54). Improving this Siah inhibitor further might
provide a novel antiangiogenic treatment option for solid
cancers in the future. In a recent study, we have shown that
Siah2 expression is correlated with triple negative, basal-like
breast cancer in patients (19). This type of breast cancer is
characterized by a strong hypoxic phenotype and inhibition of
Siah and therefore hypoxic response signaling, in combination
with standard chemotherapy, might provide a novel and
promising treatment approach in patients with these treatment-refractory tumors. As Siah-inhibitory drugs would result

in vascular normalization and elevated tumor perfusion, their
administration should ideally occur before application of
chemotherapeutic drugs. Vascular normalization has been
shown to generally improve oxygenation of tumors, providing a healthier environment for tumor growth (1). It is
thought that alleviation of hypoxia not only abrogates
continuous hypoxic signaling and the promotion of prosurvival mechanisms, but also reduces their drug resistance and
the selective pressure on tumor cells to metastasize (1, 3, 55).
It will be interesting to determine whether the reduction of
hypoxia signaling in Siah-inhibited tumors also results in a
less aggressive, less metastatic, and more drug-sensitive
phenotype. Thus, our experiments identify Siah as both a
valuable target for molecular therapy as well as an adjunct to
standard chemotherapy in breast cancer.
