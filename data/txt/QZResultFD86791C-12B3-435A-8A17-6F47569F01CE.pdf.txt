ABSTRACT
The complexity of the IGF-1 signalling axis is clearly a roadblock in targeting
this receptor in cancer therapy. Here, we sought to identify mediators of resistance,
and potential co-targets for IGF-1R inhibition. By using an siRNA functional screen
with the IGF-1R tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) BMS-754807 in MCF-7 cells we
identified several genes encoding components of the DNA damage response (DDR)
pathways as mediators of resistance to IGF-1R kinase inhibition. These included ATM
and Ataxia Telangiectasia and RAD3-related kinase (ATR). We also observed a clear
induction of DDR in cells that were exposed to IGF-1R TKIs (BMS-754807 and OSI906) as indicated by accumulation of γ-H2AX, and phosphorylated Chk1. Combination
of the IGF-1R/IR TKIs with an ATR kinase inhibitor VE-821 resulted in additive to
synergistic cytotoxicity compared to either drug alone. In MCF-7 cells with stably
acquired resistance to the IGF-1R TKI (MCF-7-R), DNA damage was also observed, and
again, dual inhibition of the ATR kinase and IGF-1R/IR kinase resulted in synergistic
cytotoxicity. Interestingly, dual inhibition of ATR and IGF-1R was more effective in
MCF-7-R cells than parental cells. IGF-1R TKIs also potentiated the effects of cisplatin
in a panel of breast cancer cell lines. Overall, our findings identify induction of DDR by
IGF-1R kinase inhibition as a rationale for co-targeting the IGF-1R with ATR kinase
inhibitors or cisplatin, particularly in cells with acquired resistance to TKIs.

metastasis of cancer cells (reviewed in [12]). IGF-1R and
Integrin cooperation has also been linked to epithelial-tomesenchymal transition (EMT), a key step in metastasis
[13] and to resistance to targeted therapies [14].
Several IGF-1R/IR inhibitors have been tested in
clinical trials, but these inhibitors have shown limited
efficacy [15, 16]. Despite these poor results, individual
responses of patients within these trials were often
striking. Figitumumab treatment led to a complete
resolution of pulmonary metastasis [17] and Ganitumab
treatment led to a 28 month sustained durable complete
response in a Ewing’s sarcoma patient [18]. However,
many other Phase II/III clinical trials, in particular
breast, lung and pancreatic cancers, have failed to show
clinical benefit in unselected patients. This is likely due
to the complexity of the IR/IGF-1R signalling axis,

INTRODUCTION
The Insulin/Insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor
(IR/IGF-1R) system is widely expressed, and while
Insulin signalling is central to glucose metabolism, IGF1 signalling has an essential role in regulating multiple
cellular pathways that govern cell fate, cell proliferation,
growth, and cancer progression [1–3]. The canonical
IGF signalling pathway recruited by the IRS scaffolding
proteins activates PI3-Kinase, Akt, and Ras, all of which
are potent oncogenes that are deregulated in many
cancers [4, 5]. The IGF-1R can also be recruited to sites
of focal adhesions to activate the FAK and MAP kinase
pathways and promote cell motility and invasiveness
[6–11]. Such dynamic cooperative signalling between
IGF-1R and Integrins may contribute to invasiveness and

compensatory mechanisms through other receptors,
and a lack of predictive tumour- and patient-selective
biomarkers of response [15, 16, 19]. Much effort is now
focused on understanding the cellular effects of IGF-1R
inhibition, the mechanisms of resistance and sensitivity,
the identification of reliable predictive biomarkers of
response, and testing options for combination with other
therapies [20]. Resistance to IGF-1R inhibition can be
mediated by compensatory up-regulation of the IR [21,
22] or Her2 Receptors [23] signalling pathways activated
by MEK [24]; or mTOR activity. Compensatory signalling
through IGF-1R can also mediate resistance to EGFR TK
inhibitors [25]. However, effective combination therapy of
IGF-1R inhibitors with chemotherapy or TK inhibitors has
not yet been demonstrated.
The possibility of combining IGF-1R inhibition with
induction of DNA damage by radiotherapy or cisplatinbased compounds is also being explored. Double or singlestranded breaks in DNA normally activate DNA damage
repair mechanisms in order to maintain genome stability.
These involve activation of the ataxia telangiectasia
mutated (ATM) and ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3-related
(ATR) kinases, which lead to cell cycle arrest and DNA
repair. Suppression of IGF-1R signalling has been shown
to enhance radiosensitivity and impair activation of ATM
[26], and to sensitize ovarian and colon cancer cells to
cisplatin [27, 28]. IGF-1R inhibition also enhances radiosensitivity in prostate cell lines due to impaired doublestranded DNA repair mechanisms [29]. Inhibition of ATR
has also been suggested as an attractive approach for
sensitization of tumour cells to DNA damaging agents.
However the impact of dual inhibition of ATR with RTKs
such as the IGF-1R has not yet been investigated.
The aim of this study was to identify mediators of
sensitivity or resistance to IGF-1R kinase inhibition. Using
a targeted RNAi screen we identified a number of genes
that sensitize cells to IGF-1R inhibition. Among these the
DNA damage and repair genes were strongly represented
suggesting they may be suitable targets for co-inhibition
with IGF-1R inhibition.

in order to determine a sub-lethal dose of inhibitor in these
cells, which was established at 30nM (Figure 1A). BMS754807 was found to inhibit phosphorylation of the IGF1R, and activation of the PI3-K and MAPK pathways in
response to IGF-1 (Supplementary Figure S1). Following
transfection with the siRNA library in 96 well plates, cells
were cultured for 24 hours and then incubated with vehicle
or BMS-754807 (30nM) for a further 48 hrs before cell
viability was assessed. The results were median-centred,
log transformed and normalized to scrambled siRNA.
Hits that affected cell viability with robust Z-scores of
at least +/- 1 mean absolute deviation (MAD) from the
scrambled siRNA were selected and carried forward for
pathway analysis, while hits with at least +/- 3MAD
were carried forward for validation studies (Figure 1B).
Pathway analysis of the hits using DAVID functional
annotation tool (http://david.abcc.ncifcrf.gov/content.
jsp?file=citation.html) indicated that inhibition of cell
cycle arrest and DNA damage and repair pathways
conferred sensitivity and in some cases resistance to
IGF-1R inhibition (Table 1). Included in these hits was
ATR (a key protein involved in DNA damage sensing
and response) that when suppressed robustly sensitized
MCF-7 cells to BMS-754807 cytotoxicity. The effects of
suppressing ATR with siRNA were further tested in the
ZR-75-1 ductal breast carcinoma cell line, which was
previously shown to be resistant to IGF-1R inhibition
(IC50 2μM for BMS-754807) [32]. Using two siRNAs
to suppress ATR expression in these cells we observed
that ATR knockdown significantly reduced colony
formation in the presence of BMS-754807 (Figure 1C).
Exposure of control cells to1μM of BMS-754807 reduced
colony formation to 75% of the untreated control, while
suppression of ATR produced a greater reduction in colony
formation (65% and 45%); indicating ATR contributes to
resistance to IGF-1R inhibition. These results confirm the
effects observed in the siRNA screen and overall indicate
that the DNA damage and repair response is engaged in
responses to IGF-1R inhibition.

IGF-1R inhibition induces DNA damage and
γ-H2AX accumulation

RESULTS

We were next interested to investigate the effects
of IGF-1R inhibition on the DNA damage response in
breast cancer cells. IGF-1R has previously been shown to
protect cells from DNA damaging agents [33, 34], and to
be critical for DNA repair by homologous recombination
following radiation in prostate cancer cells [29]. We first
observed that BMS-754807 caused a significant increase in
DNA damage along with activation of the ATR pathway,
as measured by the formation of γ-Histone2AX (γH2AX)
and phosphorylation of Chk1 on Serine 345 respectively
(Figure 2A). BMS-754807-induced DNA damage was
further verified by immunofluorescence labelling of distinct
γH2AX-containing foci that were visible in the nuclei of

SiRNA screen identifies potential biomarkers
and targets for IGF-1R inhibition
To identify potential mediators of sensitivity or
resistance to IGF-1R inhibition, we carried out a functional
screen with a customised siRNA library that was selected
to target 178 oncogenes or tumour suppressors (Figure 1).
BMS-754807 is a reversible ATP competitive dual IGF1R/IR inhibitor, with an IC50 ranging 100nM to 25μM
in breast cancer cell lines [30] and a recommended dose
of 100mg daily in patients [31]. MCF-7 cells were first
incubated with increasing concentrations of the IGF-1R/IR
kinase inhibitor BMS-754807 in colony formation assays

MCF-7 cells exposed to BMS-754807 (Supplementary
Figure S2). This induction of γH2AX in MCF-7 cells is
consistent with γH2AX induction by IGF-1R inhibition
and IGF-1R depletion observed in prostate cancer cells
[35]. Higher concentrations of BMS-754807 also induced
DNA damage (Figure 2B) leading to a four-fold increase
in γH2AX levels. Induction of γH2AX was significantly
reduced upon siRNA-mediated suppression of IGF1R expression (Supplementary Figure S3) and stable
suppression of IGF-1R using shRNA also induced γH2AX
(Figure 2C). Thus, inhibition or suppression of IGF-1R is
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

sufficient to induce DNA damage. Moreover, a second TKI
targeting the IGF-1R, OSI-906, which strongly suppresses
IGF-1 signalling in MCF-7 cells (Supplementary Figure S4)
was also shown to increase induction of γH2AX (Figure
2D). Inhibition of the PI3-K pathway, but not the MAPK
pathway led to a marked increase in γH2AX induction
(Figure 2E and 2F). It is therefore likely that the increase
in DNA damage induced by inhibition of the IGF-1R is a
result of decreased activity of the PI-3K pathway and not
the MAPK pathway. Overall, we conclude that suppression
of IGF-1R kinase activity or IGF-1R expression levels

is sufficient to induce the DNA damage and DNA repair
response pathways in breast cancer cells.

Combination of ATR and IGF-1R inhibitor
decreases clonogenic growth potential

Noting the potential therapeutic benefit of dual
inhibition of IGF-1R and ATR, we next investigated
whether the DDR contributes to resistance to the IGF1R inhibitor BMS-754807. An MCF-7 cell line that is
resistant to BMS-754807 was generated by exposure to
increasing concentrations of the inhibitor over time, until
cells were cultured in the presence of drug at a 500nM
concentration. The IC50 of these resistant cells (designated
MCF-7-R) was then compared to parental MCF-7 cells
and found to be more than 7 fold higher (Figure 4A). In
the presence of 500nM BMS-754807, parental MCF-7
cells induced apoptotic pathways leading to an increase in
the levels of cleaved PARP. However in the presence of a
similar concentration of inhibitor, MCF-7-R cells did not
show cleavage of PARP, indicating that these cells do not
undergo apoptosis when exposed to this concentration of
BMS-754807 (Figure 4B).
We next asked whether these resistant cells
exhibited γH2AX induction and activation of DNA
damage pathways. Parental MCF-7 cells were exposed to
500nM BMS-754807 and compared to MCF-7-R cells.
Parental MCF-7 cells demonstrated a large increase in
γ-H2AX and phosphorylation of Chk1compared to the
untreated controls (Figure 4C). Intriguingly, MCF-7-R
cells cultured in the presence of BMS-754807 retained
induction of γH2AX and phosphorylation of Chk1
similar to that observed in parental cells exposed to the
drug (Figure 4C). This indicates that IGF-1R inhibition
may still activate the DNA Damage repair pathways in
cells made resistant to IGF-1R kinase inhibition, and
suggests that MCF-7-R cells may be sensitive to IGF-1R
inhibition in the presence of the ATR inhibitor. To test
this concept further we examined whether dual inhibition
of IGF-1R and ATR could reverse some of the resistant
phenotype seen in these cells. Dual exposure to BMS754807 and VE-821 led to a visible reduction in colony
growth compared to either drug alone (Figure 4D), and
consistently led to a decrease in colonies across a range
of concentrations (Figure 4E). MCF-7-R cells appeared to
be clearly more sensitive to co-inhibition of IGF-1R and
ATR than parental cells. Drug synergy analysis indicated
that the relationship between the two drugs was strongly
synergistic within the ranges of 30-100nM BMS-754807
and 300-1000nM VE-821 (Figure 4F). These results
collectively indicate that MCF-7 cells resistant to the IGF1R inhibitor BMS-754807 continue to induce activation
of the ATR pathway in response to IGF-1R inhibition,
and given the lower CI values, are more sensitive to ATR
inhibition than their parental counterparts. Thus, IGF1R kinase inhibition combined with ATR inhibition may
have particular therapeutic benefit in cases of acquired
resistance to IGF-1R TKIs.

Since inhibition of the IGF-1R promoted a
pronounced accumulation of γ-H2AX (Figure 2) and
suppression of ATR sensitised cells to IGF-1R inhibition
(Figure 1), we next investigated whether dual inhibition
of IGF-1R and ATR would be effective. MCF-7 cells
were exposed to a range of concentrations of IGF-1R
TKI, to the selective ATR inhibitor VE-821 [36] or
to a combination of both agents. The effectiveness of
VE-821 in preventing ATR activation was confirmed
by pre-incubation of cells with VE-821 prior to UV
exposure (Supplementary Figure S5). Colonies were
then allowed to form for 10-14 days. Combining BMS754807 and VE-821 led to a visible reduction in colony
formation with concentrations of 10nM BMS-754807
and 100nM VE-821 (Figure 3A). This inhibition
of colony growth was notable across the range of
combinations with total loss of colony formation at a
concentration of 100nM BMS-754807 combined with
1000nM of VE-821 (Figure 3B). Synergy analyses with
the CompuSyn software [37, 38] indicated that the
Combination Index (CI) for BMS-754807 and VE-821
was just below 1. This suggests that the relationship
between the two drugs was additive-to-synergistic
between concentrations of 10 to 100nM BMS, and 100
to 1000nM VE-821 (Figure 3C).
Since the IGF-1R inhibitor OSI-906 also promoted
accumulation of γ-H2AX, we tested dual inhibition with
OSI-906 and VE-821 over a range of concentrations.
OSI-906 has been tested in clinical trials using 600mg
intermittent dosing, leading to a corresponding plasma
concentration of 1μM [31]. This also resulted in a more
pronounced reduction in colony formation compared
to cultures exposed to either agent alone (Figure 3D).
OSI-906 and VE-821 in combination consistently
decreased colony growth over the entire range of
drug concentrations (Figure 3E). Synergy calculations
indicated that the relationship between the two drugs
was additive for most concentrations, with only 50nM
and 500nM concentrations of each drug producing a
synergistic relationship (Figure 3F). The dual effect
of OSI-906 and VE-821 seemed less effective than
the dual effect of BMS-754807 and VE-821 together.
This is consistent with the observation that higher
concentrations of OSI-906 are required to totally
inactivate the kinase activity of the IGF-1R compared
with BMS-754807 (Supplementary Figures S1 and S4).
Overall the data indicates that the combined use of IGF1R and ATR inhibitors together is effective in reducing
colony growth with a relationship ranging from additive
to synergistic.

IGF-1R inhibition sensitizes breast cancer cells
to cisplatin

the IGF-1R and ATR, and the results of this study are
summarized in Figure 6. We propose that inhibition of
IGF-1R induces concurrent activation of the DNA damage
sensor ATR, knockdown of which is sufficient to sensitize
cells to BMS-754807. Importantly, in MCF-7 cells that
had acquired resistance to BMS-754807, the effects of
combining IGF-1R and ATR kinase inhibitors resulted
in more pronounced synergistic cytotoxicity than that
observed in sensitive cells. Interestingly, MCF-7-R cells
exhibited stronger synergy between BMS-754807 and VE821 than MCF-7 parental cells indicating that cells that are
resistant to BMS-754807 may be more sensitive to this
drug combination. This suggests potential for therapeutic
combination of these two agents in cancers with acquired
resistance to TKIs in the clinical setting. It may also be
possible that initial treatment with the combination may
prevent the emergence of IGF-1R inhibitor resistance by
selectively targeting ATR-activated clones.
IGF-1R inhibition has been found to delay both nonhomologous end-joining and homologous recombination
[29]. Therefore exposure to an IGF-1R inhibitor such
as BMS-754807 could delay DNA damage repair and
therefore ‘prime’ cancer cells for treatment with a DNA
damaging agent. This could make the cells more sensitive
to inhibition of ATR. Indeed, ATR inhibition preferentially
targets HR-deficient cancer cells [45]. Therefore therapies
which delay HR would be beneficial in combination
with ATR inhibitors. Indeed in prostate cancers cells,
suppression of RAD51, the recombinase that catalyses
the strand invasion step of HR, sensitises cells to IGF-1R
inhibition [35].
TKIs that inhibit the IGF-1R also inhibit the
homologous Insulin Receptor kinase, so it is possible that
some of the effects are caused by inhibition of IR activity.
However, our data herein and previous reports strongly
indicate that the effects are largely driven by IGF-1R
inhibition because suppression of IGF-1R is sufficient to
induce DNA damage [29, 35], and to prevent induction
of DNA damage by IGF-1R TKIs. This conclusion is
also supported by a study investigating the mechanism of
action of BMS-754807 where RNA profiling analysis was
used to compare its effects with those of IGF-1R knockout
[46]. The results indicated that although BMS-754807
inhibits both IGF-IR and IR, many of the gene expression
changes caused by BMS-754807 were due to IGF-IR
inhibition alone.
Inhibition of the PI3-K pathway appears to be
required for the effects of IGF-1R inhibitors in inducing
DNA damage. The AKT-PI3-K pathway has been linked
to sensitivity to IGF-1R inhibition whereby cells overexpressing components of the IGF-1R/PI3-K signalling
axis were more sensitive to IGF-1R inhibition [47, 48].
This effect may well be may be linked to induction of
DNA damage as observed in our study. Our data therefore
suggested that combining selective inhibitors of PI3-K
and ATR may also have synergistic therapeutic effects.

DNA damaging agents have a critical role in cancer
therapy, so we next investigated the effect of combining
IGF-1R inhibition and cisplatin in three breast cancer cell
lines MCF-7, ZR-75-1 and MDA-MB-231 using colony
formation assays. IGF-1R expression levels are different
in these cell lines (Figure 5A), with MCF-7 exhibiting
the highest IGF-1R expression followed by ZR-75-1 and
MDA-MB-231 cells, while all 3 cell lines are responsive
to IGF-1 stimulation as determined by phosphorylation of
AKT and ERK (Figure 5B-5D).
MCF-7, ZR-75-1, and MDA-MB-231 cells were
each exposed to BMS-754807 at 30nM, 120nM, or 300nM
in the presence of cisplatin at concentrations ranging from
0 to 1.0 μM. BMS-754807 significantly sensitized all
cell lines to cisplatin, reducing the IC50 from 496nM to
4nM in MCF-7 cells (Figure 5E), from 237nM to 52nM
in ZR-75-1 cells (Figure 5F), and from 841nM to 584nM
in the more resistant MDA-MB-231 cells (Figure 5G). A
similar effect was observed following siRNA-mediated
suppression of IGF-1R in MCF-7 cells, where the IC50
decreased from 410nM to 7nM (Figure 5H). These results
indicate that IGF-1R suppression enhances the potential of
cisplatin therapy in phenotypically distinct breast cancer
cell lines, and further indicates the benefit of combining
IGF-1R inhibitors with DNA damaging agents.
Overall, these results indicate that IGF-1R inhibition
may be effective in combination with cisplatin in breast
cancer cells that exhibit different levels of sensitivity to
either the TKI or cisplatin.

DISCUSSION
Many cancers have dysfunctional DNA repair
systems, enabling bypass of cell cycle arrest and continued
cell division with damaged DNA, which then renders these
cells more susceptible to extreme DNA damage caused
by chemotherapy and radiotherapy [39, 40]. Double or
single stranded breaks in DNA normally activate DNA
damage repair kinases, ATM and ATR to maintain genome
stability. The ATR inhibitor VE-821 has been shown to
significantly enhance the sensitivity of pancreatic cancer
cells to radiation and gemcitabine [41], to enhance the
sensitivity of ovarian cell lines to cisplatin, topotecan, and
veliparib [42], and to radiosensitize human promyelocyte
leukaemia cells [43]. In general it is considered that by
inhibiting this key component of the DNA damage repair
pathways, cancer cells are rendered more sensitive to
agents that cause DNA damage. Previous work has shown
that DNA damage sensed by ATM, a kinase related to
ATR, can induce IGF-1 expression to drive pro-survival
signals following chemotherapy or radiation [44].
Our results are, to our knowledge, the first to
provide evidence for the potential benefit of co-targeting

Figure 6: Schematic model for how dual inhibition of IGF-1R and ATR leads to increased cell death. (Left) IGF-1

binding to IGF-1R leads to phosphorylation and activation of the IGF-1R and recruitment of IRS-1 for the activation of the PI3-K pathway.
Following activation of PI3-K, AKT becomes phosphorylated on two key residues by PDK1 and TORC2. This allows for AKT to engage in
pro-survival signalling. When the IGF-1R-PI3-K-AKT pathway is active, cells are protected from the cytotoxic effects of chemotherapies
and can activate DDR and anti-apoptotic pathways to prevent cell death. (Right) In the presence of IGF-1R TKIs OSI-906 or BMS-754807,
activation of the IGF-1R and PI3-K pathway are inhibited and DNA damage is induced in the nucleus (γH2AX). In response to γH2AX,
ATR and other components of the DDR response are activated to repair DNA. However in the presence of VE-821, ATR cannot repair the
damaged DNA and cell death occurs.

Interestingly, a recent study in TNBC cell lines indicates
beneficial effects from combining an IGF-1R/IR inhibitor
(OSI-906) with a PI3K inhibitor (GDC-0491), which
indicates that PI3-K is activated independently of IGF-1R
activity [49].
Either IGF-1R kinase inhibitors or siRNA-mediated
suppression of IGF-1R expression is sufficient to sensitize
breast cancer cells to cisplatin treatment. Interestingly
MCF-7 cells exhibited the greatest increase in sensitivity
to cisplatin upon inhibition of the IGF-1R. This cell
line has the highest expression of IGF-1R among those
tested, and has been previously shown to be sensitive to
IGF-1R inhibition [30]. Though not a common therapy
for all breast cancers, cisplatin is being investigated for
use in triple negative breast cancers, in which IGF-1R
has been shown to have high activity [30]. The IGF-1R
pathway was observed to be up-regulated in microarray
analysis of Ovarian Cancer tissues while also inversely
correlating with survival [50]. Moreover, hyper-activation
of IGF-1R has been found to be essential for cisplatin
resistance in ovarian cancer [51]. This suggests that the
IGF-1R may be a potential co-targeting option for other
cancers such as ovarian cancer that are currently treated
with cisplatin. Despite much research there are currently
no reliable biomarkers available to predict response [19]
to IGF-1R inhibition. IGF-1R expression levels do not
appear to predict IGF-1R activity [52], and the differential
expression of signalling components in cancer cells that
modulate IGF-1R activity may contribute to sensitivity/
resistance to anti-IGF-1R therapies (reviewed in [12]).
This modulation has been attributed to differential
activation of PI3-K and MAPK pathway components [47,
48, 53, 54] as well as expression of alternative RTKs and
Integrin receptors [55–57]. It is likely that cancers that
are reliant on IGF-1R signalling will exhibit the greatest
benefit from co-targeting, which again highlights the lack
of biomarkers for IGF-1R activity as a key challenge.
In summary our study provides a mechanistic
rationale for the combination of IGF-1R or IGF pathway
inhibitor with ATR inhibitors or other DNA damaging
agents in breast cancer.

Cell culture, IGF-1 mediated stimulation of cells
and viability assays
MCF-7 and ZR-75-1 cells were maintained in
DMEM or RMPI medium, respectively, supplemented
with 10% foetal bovine serum and 10mM L-Glutamine and
5 mg/ml penicillin/streptomycin. Unless otherwise stated,
western blot analysis of whole cell lysates was conducted
from cells maintained in complete media with or without
appropriate treatments. For analysis of cell signalling in
response to IGF-1, cells were generally cultured at seeding
densities that allowed for an approximate 70% confluency
after 16 hours. Adhered cells were then washed three times
with serum-free media (DMEM with 10mM L-Glutamine)
and maintained in serum-free media for a total of 4 hours
followed by stimulation with 10ng/ml IGF-1 for 10
minutes.
Cell viability was assessed using Cell Titre Glo
(Promega, Madison, WI), which measures ATP. Cells were
seeded into 96 well plates, and 24 hrs later were incubated
with BMS-754807 for a further 48 hrs. Cells were then
lysed using Cell Titre Glo reagent and analysed using a
spectrophotometer.

Oncogene and tumour suppressor gene siRNA
library
Three independent siRNAs for each target tumour
suppressor or oncogene were arrayed in a 96-well
platform. MCF-7 cells were reverse transfected with
10nM siRNA for 24 hrs, after which cells were treated
with 30nM BMS or vehicle control for 48 hrs. Viability
was assessed using Cell Titre Glo as above. Results
were median-centred; log transformed and normalized to
scrambled siRNA controls. Hits with robust Z-scores of at
least +/- 1MAD from the scrambled siRNA were selected
and carried forward for pathway analysis, while hits with
at least +/- 3MAD were carried forward for validation
studies.
To suppress IGF-1R expression specifically, two
individual oligos targeting the IGF-1R were obtained from
Qiagen (cat # S100017521 and S102624552). A nontargeting oligonucleotide, Silencer Negative siRNA Control
#2 (AM4311) from Ambion (Cambridgeshire, UK) was used
as a Negative Control. Transfections were performed with a
final concentration of 20nM siRNA using RNAiMAX. For
siRNA transfection, cells were trypsinsed and re-suspended
in Penicillin/Streptomycin-free culture media. siRNA
oligonucleotides were diluted to a final volume of 162.5 μl
in OptiMem media. RNAiMAX transfection reagent (7.5 μl

and samples were incubated for 5 minutes. 300 μl of the
siRNA/RNAiMAX complex was pipetted to 1 well of a
6-well plate and 8.5 x 105 cells (in a final volume of 1.2ml)
were then added. Cells were allowed to adhere overnight
to the tissue culture plate, in the presence of the siRNA/
RNAiMAX complex. 24 hours post-transfection, the siRNA/
RNAiMAX complex was removed and cells were reseeded
for experiments. Suppression of IGF-1R was detected by
western blotting with anti-IGF-1R antibodies.

survival. For combination treatments with cisplatin, samples
were compared to BMS-754807 treatment alone (100%). All
graphs and IC50 calculations were generated using GraphPad
Prism software, and results are generally represented on
graphs in Log scale as a fraction of the untreated controls.

Preparation of cellular extracts and
western blotting
Cell lysates were generated using RIPA lysis
buffer (50mM Tris pH 7.4, 150mM NaCl, 1% NP40,
0.5% Sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% Sodium Dodecyl
Sulfate). Immediately prior to cell lysis fresh phosphatase
inhibitors, Sodium Orthovanadate (Na3VO4) (1mM),
β-Glycerophosphate (βGP) (1mM), and Sodium
Pyrophosphate (SPP) (2.5mM), and protease inhibitors
(Halt cocktail 1/100 dilution; AEBSF, aprotinin,
bestatin, E-64, leupeptin and pepstatin A) were added
to lysis buffer. Following incubation on ice for 20
minutes, nuclear and cellular debris were removed by
centrifugation at 14000 RPM for 15 minutes at 4°C.
Protein concentration was determined via Bradford
Assay utilising Bradford protein quantification reagent
at a wavelength of 595nm (Spectramax 384). Following
estimation of protein concentration, samples were
denatured by boiling for 5 minutes in 5X loading buffer
(2% w/v SDS, 8% v/v glycerol, 60mM Tris-HCL, pH6.8,
1.2% β-mercaptoethanol, and 0.2-0.4% Bromophenol
Blue) and equal amounts of protein were resolved by
SDS-PAGE and analysed by western immunoblotting.
Nitrocellulose membranes were then blocked for 1 hour
at room temperature in Tris-buffered saline containing
0.05% Tween 20 (TBS-T) and 5% Bovine Serum Albumin
(w/v). All primary antibody incubations were performed
overnight at 4°C, and secondary antibody incubations
were for 1 hour at room temperature. Alexa Fluor 680and 800-coupled anti-rabbit and anti-mouse secondary
antibodies (LI-COR Biosciences Cambridge, UK) were
used for detection with the Odyssey infrared imaging
system (LI-COR Biosciences, Cambridge, UK).

Stable suppression of IGF-1R
For stable suppression of the IGF-1R cells pGIPZ
shRNA scramble vector (catalogue ID RHS 4346) along
with pGIPZ IGFIR ShRNA-1 (RHS4430-98705133) and
pGIPZ IGFIR shRNA-2 (RHS 4430-98485874) were
transfected into MCF-7 cells. Briefly, MCF-7 cells were
seeded at a density of 1.2x 106 cells/10 cm tissue culture
dish, in Penicillin/Streptomycin-free medium. Eighteen
hours later, cells were transfected with relevant plasmids.
Solution A was prepared containing 10 μg DNA/10 cm
tissue culture dish diluted in OptiMem serum-free medium
to 400 μl in volume. Solution B was prepared containing
Lipofectamine 2000 at 20 μl per 10 cm tissue culture dish
diluted in OptiMem to 400 μl in volume. Both Solution A
and B were incubated at room temperature for 5 minutes
in the dark prior to mixing at a ratio of 1:1 and further
incubation at room temperature for 20 minutes. The cells
to be transfected were washed twice with OptiMem, prior
to addition of 800μl of the DNA/Lipofectamine in a dropwise fashion. 2.2ml of additional OptiMem was then added
to each plate. Following this, the transfected cells were
incubated at 37°C overnight. Selection of stable pools was
then immediately commenced in DMEM complete media
containing puromycin at a concentration of 0.5μg/ml. Drug
containing media was regularly replenished and selection
was deemed complete when all cells in the untransfected
control plate where dead (~6days).

Colony formation assays
Drug sensitivity was assessed using colony formation
assays. 2x103 (MCF-7 cell) and 4x103 (MCF-7-R cells) were
seeded into each well of a 6 well plate. 24 hrs later, cells were
incubated with varying concentrations of drug to determine
a concentration that was cytotoxic to approximately 50%
of the cells. For cisplatin and BMS-754807 combinations,
cells were treated with a concentration of drug that killed
approximately 30% of the cells. Cells were transfected with
siRNA for 24 hours prior to seeding in tissue culture plates
at low density and were allowed to grow for up to 21 days,
or until colony growth was visible in control wells. Colonies
were fixed in 95% Ethanol for 10 minutes and stained
with 0.05% crystal violet in 0.1% Ethanol for 30 minutes.
Colonies present were measured by infrared scanning using
Odyssey Scanning Equipment. IC50 values were determined
as the concentration that results in a 50% reduction in cell

Generation of BMS-754807 resistant MCF-7 cells
Parental MCF-7 cells were exposed to increasing
step-wise increments of BMS-754807 until cells were
proliferating successfully in the presence of each
increased drug concentration, and a resistant pool
had been generated. Cells were then permanently
maintained in cell culture medium containing 500nM
BMS-754807.

Statistical and drug relationship analysis
P values were calculated using Student-T-Test,
or where specified using 2way-ANOVA (P<0.05).
Quantification of drug synergism and antagonism were
conducted using CompuSyn Software.
