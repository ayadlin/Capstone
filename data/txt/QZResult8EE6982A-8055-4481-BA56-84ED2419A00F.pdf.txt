Abstract
BRAF mutations are associated with aggressive, less-differentiated and therapy-resistant colorectal carcinoma. However,
the underlying mechanisms for these correlations remain
unknown. To understand how oncogenic B-Raf contributes to
carcinogenesis, in particular to aspects other than cellular
proliferation and survival, we generated three isogenic human
colorectal carcinoma cell line models in which we can dynamically modulate the expression of the B-RafV600E oncoprotein.
Doxycyclin-inducible knockdown of endogenous B-RafV600E
decreases cellular motility and invasion in conventional and
three-dimensional (3D) culture, whereas it promotes cell–cell
contacts and induces various hallmarks of differentiated epithelia. Importantly, all these effects are recapitulated by B-Raf
(PLX4720, vemurafenib, and dabrafenib) or MEK inhibitors
(trametinib). Surprisingly, loss of B-RafV600E in HT29 xenografts does not only stall tumor growth, but also induces

glandular structures with marked expression of CDX2, a
tumor-suppressor and master transcription factor of intestinal
differentiation. By performing the ﬁrst transcriptome proﬁles of
PLX4720-treated 3D cultures of HT29 and Colo-205 cells, we
identify several upregulated genes linked to epithelial differentiation and effector functions, such as claudin-1, a Cdx-2
target gene encoding a critical tight junction component. Thereby, we provide a mechanism for the clinically observed correlation between mutant BRAF and the loss of Cdx-2 and claudin1. PLX4720 also suppressed several metastasis-associated transcripts that have not been implicated as targets, effectors or
potential biomarkers of oncogenic B-Raf signaling so far.
Together, we identify a novel facet of clinically applied B-Raf
or MEK inhibitors by showing that they promote cellular
adhesion and differentiation of colorectal carcinoma cells.

Introduction

initiating colorectal carcinoma, little is known about the
mechanisms underlying metastasis (1, 2). However, there is
a pressing need to better understand and target metastatic
colorectal carcinoma.
BRAF encodes a Ser/Thr kinase of the Ras/MEK/ERK pathway
and is mutated in various tumor entities. The most common
mutation, V600E, renders the kinase constitutively active and
occurs in 11% of colorectal carcinoma (3). BRAF mutations are
implicated as early "signature events" in the so-called serrated
pathway describing the progression from serrated adenoma to
colorectal carcinomas (2, 4). Importantly, BRAF-mutant colorectal carcinomas can be subdivided in two subgroups that
differ in terms of microsatellite stability (MSS) and clinical
outcome (5). The majority of BRAF-mutant colorectal carcinomas belong to the microsatellite instable (MSI) class, which
poses the lowest risk for relapse of all colorectal carcinoma
subtypes (6, 7). However, BRAF-mutant colorectal carcinomas
with MSS represents a very aggressive entity and forecast a poor
prognosis (8–10). Interestingly, BRAF-mutant colorectal carcinomas present with a distinct pattern of metastatic spread, in
particular peritoneal carcinomatosis, and a shorter overall
survival even after metastasectomy (11, 12).
The discovery of B-RafV600E has been translated into clinically
applied kinase inhibitors, such as vemurafenib or dabrafenib.
As single agents, they yield unprecedented responses in BRAFmutant melanoma (13, 14). However, such an efﬁcacy was not

Colorectal carcinomas are characterized by a series of (epi)
genetic alterations, including aberrant Wnt pathway activity
and gain-of-function mutations in the KRAS or BRAF protooncogenes. Compared with advances in deciphering the events

Oncogenic B-Raf Suppresses Epithelial Differentiation

observed in the small groups of 21 patients with colorectal
carcinoma treated with these compounds. Nevertheless, these
inhibitors still elicited partial responses and stabilized disease
in some patients (14, 15). Depending on their mutational
landscape, BRAF-mutant colorectal carcinoma cell lines display
differential sensitivity toward B-Raf or MEK inhibitors in tissue
culture and xenograft models (4, 13, 16–18). Thus, these
compounds still hold clinical promise, in particular if their
combination with other substances is considered and once the
complex pathology and genetic heterogeneity of colorectal
carcinoma are better understood. Indeed, combination strategies show efﬁcacy in preclinical colorectal carcinoma models as
they target more than one critical node for proliferation and
survival. These approaches prevent compensatory feedback
loops and crosstalk, which currently limit the use of B-Raf
inhibitors as single agents (4, 19–21). These preclinical drug
combinations initiated several clinical trials that are currently
ongoing (www.clinicaltrials.gov) and a ﬁrst case report further
demonstrates the utility of such combinations (22). However,
to interpret the effect of such combinatorial approaches, it is
necessary to obtain a more comprehensive understanding of
their effects as monosubstances. Herein, we characterize three
isogenic colorectal carcinoma cell line models in which BRafV600E can be dynamically modulated. We demonstrate that
B-RafV600E controls promigratory and proinvasive effectors and
suppresses hallmarks of intestinal differentiation. Importantly,
we report that clinically relevant B-Raf and MEK inhibitors
mimic the effects of B-RafV600E depletion, suggesting that they
promote a more differentiated and adhesive state, which in turn
might improve prognosis and drug response.

Materials and Methods
Tissue culture
Short tandem repeat–authenticated Colo-205 cells were purchased from CLS Cell Lines Service GmbH (Heidelberg, Germany) and cultured in RPMI-1640 with 10% FCS. Total passage
time was under 6 months. Caco-2 and HT29 sublines and associated recombinant DNAs were described previously (23). All
other lines were kindly provided by Stephan Feller (MartinLuther-University Halle-Wittenberg, Germany) and cultivated
like HT29 cells. Except for Colo-205, the identity of all lines was
conﬁrmed by SNP analysis (Multiplexion) in June 2014. Threedimensional (3D) cultures were set-up in their culture medium as
described previously (24). Details on cellular assays (clonogenic,
wound healing, migration, and invasion as well as cell-cycle
analyses) are described in Supplementary Data. Organotypic
collagen I assays were set-up as described previously (25).
Inhibitors and inducers
The following inhibitors were dissolved in DMSO: PLX4720
(Santa Cruz Biotechnology), dabrafenib, trametinib, vemurafenib (PLX4032), and geﬁtinib were purchased from Selleck
Chemicals. Doxycycline was used at 2 mg/mL (24).
Immunoﬂuorescence
Immunoﬂuorescence microscopy was conducted as described
previously (24) using the antibody manufacturers' instructions.
Topro-3 iodide was used as counterstain and bound primary
antibodies were detected using the secondary antibodies Alexa

www.aacrjournals.org

Fluor 488 goat-anti-mouse IgG and Alexa Fluor 488 goat-antirabbit IgG (Invitrogen).
Western blotting
Western blotting was performed as described previously
(23, 24). Detailed information on antibodies is provided in
Supplementary Data. Blotted proteins were visualized with a
Fusion Solo chemiluminescence reader and quantiﬁed using
FusionCapt software (Vilber Lourmat).
Rac1 pulldown
Pulldown assays were conducted as described previously (26).
PLX4720 or DMSO was added daily.
Xenografts
All procedures were carried out in accordance with local
animal ethics committees (G-12/34 and G-13/116). Subcutaneous xenografts were generated by injecting 1  106 HT29
cells (in 100 mL PBS) into severely immunocompromised
Rag2/;gc/ mice. Once tumors became measurable at d7,
mice were randomly distributed to treatment groups and
received doxycycline (2 mg/mL) via sucrose-supplemented
(35 g/L) drinking water or not. Inhibitors were applied by oral
gavage as indicated. Tumors were measured with calipers and
subjected to histologic processing. Formalin-ﬁxed and parafﬁnembedded xenograft tumors were cut (3 mm), deparafﬁnized,
subjected to standard operating procedures-driven antigen
retrieval and antibody staining (primary antibodies for CK20,
Cdx-2, PAS, Ki67, and secondary reagents according to routine
diagnostic procedures) in a DAKO autostainer.
RNA isolation and time-resolved microarray analysis
RNA was extracted using the Universal RNA Puriﬁcation Kit
(GeneMatrix) from Roboklon. RNA quality and integrity was
veriﬁed using the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer system (Agilent Technologies). Transcript proﬁling is described in detail in Supplementary Data. Gene-expression data are available at GEO using
the following link http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.
cgi?token¼edcfcmuszbudrst&acc¼GSE50791.
Statistical analysis
Quantitative data are presented as mean  SE. Multiple group
and pair-wise comparisons were performed by ANOVA or the
Student t test (two-tailed), respectively. A P value of 0.05 was
considered statistically signiﬁcant ( , P < 0.001;  , P < 0.01;
and  , P < 0.05). Unless noted otherwise, bar diagrams report
the mean of three independent experiments. Statistics of transcriptome data are described in Supplementary Data.

Results
Establishment of conditional B-RafV600E knockdown systems
To evaluate endogenous B-RafV600E for its contribution to the
phenotype of human colorectal carcinoma cell lines within an
isogenic background, we generated conditional cell line models.
For this approach, we chose two model cell lines, HT29 and Colo205. Both lines display MSS (Supplementary Table S1), and are
therefore likely derived from tumors belonging to the aforementioned high relapse risk subgroup. HT29 was generated from a
primary colonic adenocarcinoma (Dukes stage B) and represents a

"moderately differentiated" cell line characterized by growth in
epithelial sheets. HT29 cells express E-cadherin but lack tight
junctions (TJ; ref. 27). In contrast, the poorly differentiated Colo205 cells represent metastatic cells derived from ascites of a patient
with Duke's stage D colon carcinoma. Both lines were transduced
with a nonsilencing control or two pTRIPZ constructs (3_11 and
1_14) allowing the doxycycline-regulated knockdown of BRafV600E but not of B-Rafwt (23). All experiments in the main
ﬁgures were performed with the construct 3_11, key experiments
are also shown with 1_14 (Supplementary Data).

B-RafV600E enhances migration and suppresses the epithelial
function of colorectal carcinoma lines derived from primary
tumors
First, we evaluated the characteristics of HT29 cells in conventional two-dimensional (2D) culture following B-RafV600E knockdown. Commensurate with our ﬁnding that B-RafV600E knockdown strongly reduces MEK/ERK phosphorylation in HT29
cells (23), colony growth was impaired, and cells accumulated
in the G1-phase (Fig. 1A and B). However, neither gross morphologic changes nor a signiﬁcant increase in cell death were

Oncogenic B-Raf Suppresses Epithelial Differentiation

observed upon B-RafV600E knockdown (Supplementary Fig. S1A
and S1B). Nevertheless, B-RafV600E knockdown speciﬁcally
impaired migration (Fig. 1C). Conversely, ectopically expressed
B-RafV600E induced an elongated morphology, faster spreading,
and enhanced cell migration of Caco-2 cells, another line derived
from a MSS adenocarcinoma (Supplementary Fig. S1C–S1F).
This prompted us to analyze the expression of b-integrin subunits
in both cell lines. Indeed, B-Raf induced b1- and b4-integrin in
Caco-2 cells (Supplementary Fig. S1G), whereas B-RafV600E
knockdown and the vemurafenib tool compound PLX4720
slightly reduced b1-integrin levels in HT29 cells (Fig. 1D). Given
the link between Rac-GTPases and integrins, we next evaluated
the inﬂuence of oncogenic B-Raf on the activation of Rac-1 and its
splice variant Rac1b, which is linked to aggressive colorectal
carcinoma behavior (28). Knockdown of B-RafV600E did not affect
Rac1-GTP levels, but was accompanied by a signiﬁcant reduction
of Rac1b-GTP (Fig. 1D and E and Supplementary Fig. S2A).
The impact of cancer-associated mutations is increasingly studied using 3D tissue culture (24, 29). For example, Caco-2 cells are
widely used to study epithelial effector functions and form cysts in
3D culture. Their single lumen can be enlarged by cholera toxin
(CTX)–mediated increase in cyst ﬂuid volume, an event that
requires intact TJ and therefore reﬂects their functionality (29).
To study the relevance of B-RafV600E signaling for the behavior of
HT29 cells in 3D culture, single cells were seeded into Matrigel and
assayed similarly to Caco-2 cysts (Fig. 2A; refs. 23, 29). In sharp
contrast with Caco-2 cysts, CTX did not induce large lumina in
HT29 spheroids in untreated or doxycycline-treated nonsilencing
cells. Strikingly, spheroids with B-RafV600E knockdown reacted
toward CTX treatment with the formation of large lumina (Fig. 2B
and Supplementary Fig. S2B). Importantly, this phenotype was
reproduced by administration of PLX4720, vemurafenib, dabrafenib, and the MEK inhibitor trametinib (Fig. 2C and Supplementary Fig. S2C). In contrast, the EGFR inhibitor geﬁtinib
showed no effect on 3D morphology and lumen formation and
did not further enhance the effects in combination with PLX4720.
This indicates that inhibition of the B-Raf/MEK axis is necessary
and sufﬁcient for lumen formation and is not inﬂuenced by the
crosstalk between the EGFR and oncogenic B-Raf (19, 20). Thus,
depletion or pharmacologic inhibition of B-RafV600E enables
HT29 spheroids to respond to CTX with the formation of large
lumina.
Next, we analyzed the effect of B-RafV600E knockdown or
inhibition on signaling in 3D cultures. As conﬁrmed by Fig.
2D, induction of the V600E-speciﬁc shRNA strongly reduced BRafV600E expression as well as MEK/ERK phosphorylation, both of
which were not affected by CTX (Supplementary Fig. S2D).
Likewise, PLX4720 markedly reduced MEK phosphorylation
demonstrating potent B-Raf inhibition. However, ERK phosphorylation was mildly affected in PLX4720-treated cells compared
with those with B-RafV600E knockdown. Nevertheless, the comparable reduction of the well-established ERK target gene product
DUSP6, which integrates ERK activity over longer periods of time
(30), conﬁrms that PLX4720 had a long-lasting effect on ERK
activity. In fact, loss of DUSP6 could increase the half-life of pERK
in cells with B-RafV600E knockdown or inhibition explaining the
differential effects on pMEK and pERK levels. In any case, the
strong reduction in pMEK levels argues against the paradoxical
ERK activation described for B-Raf inhibitors (23). We exclude
waning PLX4720 concentrations in the long-term cultures as an
explanation for pERK persistence since readdition of PLX4720 1

hour before lysis did not further reduce pERK levels (Supplementary Fig. S2E).
In agreement with the unchanged E-cadherin staining, no
considerable alteration in E-cadherin expression was observed.
However, b1-integrin was again reduced in B-RafV600E–depleted
or –inhibited spheroids (Fig. 2D), which reﬂects our results of
Caco-2tet and HT29 2D cultures. Collectively, we show that
B-RafV600E increases the motility of HT29 and Caco-2 cells in
2D culture, controls promigratory molecules like Rac1b and
b1-integrin, and enables HT29 spheroids to respond to CTX with
lumina formation.
Loss of B-RafV600E signaling restores cell–cell adhesion of
metastatic Colo-205 cells and reduces their invasive potential
Next, we analyzed the effects of B-RafV600E knockdown or
inhibition in Colo-205 cells. In 2D culture, loss of B-RafV600E led
to a 3-fold increase in cell death (Supplementary Fig. S2F and
S2G). Within the time frame of this experiment, the cells maintained their typical "lymphocytic" morphology (Supplementary
Fig. S3A).
Subsequently, we analyzed the importance of B-RafV600E for the
3D phenotype of Colo-205 cells. Without doxycycline, Colo-205
cells containing either the nonsilencing or the V600E-speciﬁc
shRNA grew as loose clusters showing a weak and diffuse staining
of E-cadherin (Fig. 3A) and b-catenin (Supplementary Fig. S3B).
Importantly, B-RafV600E knockdown caused the formation of
compact spheroids with deﬁned membranous E-cadherin or
b-catenin localization. Analysis of 3D lysates revealed that Ecadherin was also increased on the protein level (Fig. 3B). This
suggests that B-RafV600E confers the dispersive phenotype of Colo205 cells in 3D culture and counteracts the function of adherens
junctions (AJ). Indeed, PLX4720 and the clinically relevant inhibitors vemurafenib, dabrafenib, or trametinib induced a highly
comparable "compaction" phenotype (Fig. 3C and D). However,
geﬁtinib did not provoke such an effect. Thus, the "compaction"
phenotype is speciﬁcally caused by loss of B-RafV600E expression,
activity or downstream signaling.
As p120ctn stabilizes AJ by blocking E-cadherin endocytosis (31), we addressed the subcellular localization of this
catenin relative in Colo-205 cells. In full agreement with our
hypothesis that B-RafV600E impairs AJs, membranous localization of p120ctn was markedly increased upon oncoprotein
knockdown or inhibition (Fig. 4A). This increase in membrane-associated p120ctn was correlated with its enhanced
phosphorylation at Y228, a marker for its incorporation into
AJs (31), in lysates from doxycycline- or PLX4720-treated
Colo-205 spheroids (Fig. 4B).
Next, we monitored additional signaling events in the lysates
from 3D cultures with B-RafV600E knockdown (Fig. 3B) or inhibition (Supplementary Fig. S3C). As seen for HT29 cells, doxycycline treatment markedly reduced B-RafV600E expression and
MEK/ERK phosphorylation. We also noted that Rac1b-GTP,
which is implicated as a negative regulator of E-cadherin–mediated cell–cell adhesion and as a promoter of cell motility (28), was
markedly reduced by B-RafV600E knockdown in 2D culture (Fig.
4C and D and Supplementary Fig. S3D). This prompted us to
analyze the effect of B-RafV600E on migration and invasion. This
showed that vemurafenib signiﬁcantly reduced both Transwell
migration and invasion (Fig. 4E and F). In a 3D organotypic
collagen I assay (25), Colo-205 cells with B-RafV600E knockdown
failed to invade the matrix, whereas their untreated isogenic

detectable in deep layers of the plug (Fig. 4G).
B-RafV600E inhibition induces a transcript signature correlated
with better clinical prognosis
Next, we performed a time-resolved microarray analysis to
investigate the transcriptome changes induced by B-Raf inhibition
(see Supplementary Fig. S4A and S4B and Supplementary Table
S2 for principal component/correlation analysis and a list of all
regulated genes, respectively). Although this analysis revealed cell
line–speciﬁc differences, about 130 PLX4720-responsive genes

220 Cancer Res; 75(1) January 1, 2015

were commonly up- or downregulated following drug treatment
in both cell lines (Fig. 5A). Looking at the 50 most up- or
downregulated genes, PLX4720 reduced ERK target gene transcripts such as FOS or IER3 within the ﬁrst 24 hours (Fig. 5B),
again demonstrating long-lasting ERK inhibition. Interestingly,
the ERK target gene ERBB receptor feedback inhibitor 1 (ERRFI1,
Mig-6; ref. 32) was signiﬁcantly downregulated in both cell lines
(Fig. 5B–D). Thus, attenuation of oncogenic B-Raf signaling
causes not only the loss of a rapid phosphorylation mediated
(19), but also of a delayed negative feedback loop silencing the
EGFR via the de novo synthesis of an EGFR inhibitor. Furthermore,

we observed a 2.2-fold downregulation of CDC25C (Supplementary Table S2). This phosphatase is also phosphorylated in a BRaf–dependent manner, and thereby responsible for the inefﬁcacy
of vemurafenib in many colorectal carcinoma lines (19).

augments AKT phosphorylation in 2D culture (19, 20), we next
analyzed the phosphorylation status of this kinase at its two key
regulatory sites. Similar to 2D tissue culture experiments (19),
phosphorylation of S473, an important residue for maximum
AKT activation, was increased in HT29 and Colo-205 spheroid
lysates. Interestingly, however, phosphorylation of T308, the
even more relevant phosphorylation site for AKT activity, was
not upregulated, suggesting that B-RafV600E rather suppresses
the mTORC2–AKT than the PDK1–AKT axis (Supplementary
Fig. S4C and S4E). These ﬁndings represent important details
for combination therapies involving antibodies or inhibitors
targeting the EGFR.
Importantly, both lines upregulate transcripts explaining the
drastic phenotypic changes observed in 3D culture upon loss of
B-RafV600E signaling (Supplementary Table S3). Indeed, many
of the top 50 upregulated transcripts (Fig. 5B), for example,
AKR1B10, CES, HPGD, RARRES1, TFF3, or TXNIP, are linked to
epithelial differentiation and effector functions (Supplementary Table S4). Moreover, the master transcription factor of
intestinal development and epithelial differentiation, Cdx-2,

224 Cancer Res; 75(1) January 1, 2015

was signiﬁcantly upregulated in Colo-205 and HT29 cells by
PLX4720 treatment at the transcript (Supplementary Table S2)
and protein level (Fig. 5C–E). As shown in Fig. 6A, this is also
reﬂected by the upregulation of various previously identiﬁed
Cdx-2 targets (33). For example, AMACR, a potential Cdx-2
target and marker for differentiated colorectal carcinomas, was
upregulated in HT29 and Colo-205 cells (Fig. 5B and E) and
also in three additional BRAFV600E-mutant colorectal carcinoma lines (Colo-201, LS411, and HDC135), which we used for
additional follow-up (Supplementary Fig. S4F). Furthermore,
the TJ components claudin-15 (CLDN15) and claudin-18
(CLDN18) were upregulated in Colo-205 cells following BRafV600E inhibition or knockdown. Interestingly, these claudins
were not prominently upregulated in HT29 cells, in which we
observed a signiﬁcant induction of claudin-1 (CLDN1; Fig. 5C
and D and Supplementary Fig. S5A–S5C). The reciprocal relationship between B-RafV600E and Cdx-2, claudin-1 and -18 was
further conﬁrmed in Caco-2tet cells, which spontaneously
differentiate with increasing conﬂuency. Here, these proteins
were upregulated in cultures transfected with the empty and

Oncogenic B-Raf Suppresses Epithelial Differentiation

B-Rafwt expression vectors, whereas B-RafV600E expression counteracted their upregulation (Fig. 5F).
Conversely, PLX4720 suppressed transcripts promoting migration and invasion. For example, b4-integrin (ITGB4), which was
induced by B-RafV600E in Caco-2tet cells and contributes to
colorectal tumor progression (34), was reduced in Colo-205 and
to a lesser extent in HT29 cells (Fig. 5C and D and Supplementary
Table S2). Furthermore, Fascin1 (FSCN1), a gene increasingly
implicated in metastasis (35), was downregulated at the transcript
level in Colo-205 and at the protein level in Colo-201, Colo-205,
and LS411 cells (Fig. 5B and E and Supplementary Fig. S4F). In full
agreement with a previous study linking Fascin1 to loss of
differentiation (35), HT29 cells lacked Fascin1 expression (Fig.
5E). Likewise, myoferlin (MYOF), a gene linked to breast cancer
progression (36) and metastasis of pancreatic carcinoma (37),
was downregulated in Colo-205 cells (Fig. 5B and Supplementary
Fig. S6A). B-Raf inhibition also altered the expression levels of
transcripts controlling proteolytic processes. For example,
ADAM19 and KLK3 were reduced in PLX4720-treated Colo205 cells. Likewise, SERPINE2, which represents a promoter of
tumor progression and metastasis in many tumor entities, was
downregulated in both cell types. Conversely, the protease inhibitor SPINK1, an inhibitor of invasive processes and marker for a
favorable prognosis in patients with colorectal carcinoma (38),
was upregulated in both cell lines (Fig. 5B and Supplementary Fig.
S6A). Importantly, our analyses also identiﬁed PLX4720-suppressed transcripts such as FGF19 and KIAA1199 (Fig. 5B–D and
Supplementary Figs. S4F and S6A). Both are discussed as markers
for poor prognosis in several entities (39, 40).
Furthermore, we identiﬁed transcripts in Colo-205 cells associated with stemness: PIWIL1, a critical epigenetic regulator
implicated in self-renewal of normal and cancer stem cells
(41), was strongly downregulated by PLX4720 (Fig. 5B and
Supplementary Fig. S6A). Interestingly, transcripts of two genes
controversially discussed as stemness markers, SMOC2 and
OLFM4 (42), were upregulated by PLX4720 (Fig. 5B and Supplementary Fig. S6A). However, the well-established markers of
intestinal crypts such as LGR5 and BMI (42) were not affected
by PLX4720 (Supplementary Table S2) arguing against the induction of stemness. In fact, both cell lines loose stemness-associated
transcripts following B-Raf inhibition (Supplementary Fig. S6B).
The diverse cancer-related processes affected by PLX4720 treatment are summarized in Fig. 6B.
Next, we compared the PLX4720 response of both cell lines
with clinical data, in which a 64–gene-expression signature for
BRAF-mutant colorectal carcinomas was established (9). We
mapped 57 of the 64 genes onto our transcriptome data,
illustrating the similarities of our 3D cell culture systems with
the in vivo transcriptomes of clinical colorectal carcinoma samples. By plotting the mean fold change after PLX4720 treatment
individually for both classiﬁer gene groups, a signiﬁcant differential gene regulation over time was observed (Fig. 6C). Importantly, this classiﬁer comprises several of the most-regulated
transcripts of PLX4720-treated spheroids such as SPINK1,
AMACR, CDX2, FSCN1, and PIWIL1. This demonstrates how
the in vitro transcriptome of both lines switches from a transcriptome reﬂecting BRAF-mutant colorectal carcinomas toward
one based on tumors lacking this mutation. Thus, many transcriptional alterations typically observed in clinical BRAFmutant colorectal carcinoma samples might be reversible by
pharmacologic intervention.

B-RafV600E suppresses hallmarks of intestinal differentiation in
vivo
To analyze the role of oncogenic B-Raf signaling in vivo, xenograft experiments with HT29 cells containing nonsilencing or
V600E shRNA constructs were performed. Doxycycline administration (starting at d7) stalled the growth of xenografts containing
the V600E-speciﬁc shRNA construct, whereas tumors in the doxycycline-treated nonsilencing group or in both untreated groups
grew exponentially (Fig. 7A and Supplementary Fig. S6C). Strikingly, B-RafV600E knockdown induced the formation of glandular
structures (Fig. 7B), which was further conﬁrmed by periodic acidSchiff (PAS) and Cdx-2 staining (2, 43, 44). Importantly, glandular differentiation was not observed in the three control groups
maintaining B-RafV600E expression. Doxycycline administration
to HT29/V600E shRNA carrying mice reduced the number of cells
expressing the proliferation marker Ki-67. In agreement with
earlier studies (16, 17), tumor regression was also observed in
mice treated with vemurafenib or trametinib (Fig. 7C). Furthermore, differentiated areas were observed in most vemurafenibtreated xenografts, albeit to various degrees (Fig. 7D). In agreement with the high efﬁcacy of MEK inhibitors in colorectal
carcinoma lines (16), glandular differentiation was more
advanced and visible in all trametinib-treated xenografts. In both
drug-treated xenograft groups, glandular differentiation was conﬁrmed by PAS and Cdx-2 staining. Importantly, glandular differentiation was not observed in any of the DMSO-treated xenografts. Thus, the differentiation-suppressing effect of B-RafV600E/
MEK/ERK signaling observed in vitro can be reproduced in xenografts in vivo.

Discussion
BRAFV600E confers a poor prognosis to patients with MSS
colorectal carcinomas (8–10) and increases peritoneal metastasis
(11, 12). However, the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying these correlations remain ill-deﬁned as most studies
addressed oncogenic B-Raf in terms of its impact on colorectal
carcinoma initiation by focusing on proliferation and survival
(4, 19). Furthermore, studies relied on the phenotypic comparison of cell lines or tumors with either wild-type or mutant BRAF
status, which, although insightful, only allows drawing conclusions of correlative nature. Here, we generated three conditional
human colorectal carcinoma cell line models, which allow us to
directly analyze the acute inﬂuence of B-RafV600E within an
isogenic setting. We demonstrate that B-RafV600E enhances migration and invasion, impairs cellular junctions and controls epithelial differentiation markers of prognostic relevance.
For example, B-RafV600E suppresses the function of TJ, a hallmark of intestinal epithelia. We demonstrate that reduction of
chronic B-Raf/MEK signaling induces large lumina upon CTX
exposure, suggesting an improved sealing of cell–cell contacts.
However, the expression and/or localization of critical TJ components or regulators, such as occludin, ZO-1 or scribble were not
altered (Supplementary Fig. S6D and S6E and data not shown).
This suggests that, in the presence of B-RafV600E, HT29 cells are
able to form rudimentary but "leaky" TJs in which not all critical
components are properly localized or expressed. Indeed, we
demonstrate for the ﬁrst time that B-RafV600E suppresses the
expression of three distinct claudins. In HT29 cells, knockdown
or inhibition of B-RafV600E upregulated the barrier forming and
sealing claudin-1. Conversely, B-RafV600E strongly reduces

Oncogenic B-Raf Suppresses Epithelial Differentiation

Interestingly, Colo-205 cells with B-RafV600E knockdown or inhibition upregulated the pore-forming claudin-15 and -18, which
contribute to cell–cell adhesion, and thereby fulﬁll a critical
function in gastrointestinal development (46). Thus, these claudins, together with the sequestration of p120ctn into the reformed
AJs (Fig. 4A and B), an event known to counteract the proinvasive
character of free p120ctn (31), might contribute to the compaction of Colo-205 spheroids.
But how does B-RafV600E suppress claudins? To our knowledge,
nothing is known about the mechanism regulating claudin-15
and -18 expression. Thus, our analyses connect these lessercharacterized claudins to B-RafV600E signaling. In contrast, there
is a controversy about the mechanisms underlying claudin-1
expression. For example, the NF-kB, Wnt-, and MEK/ERK pathways as well as Snail1, Cdx-1/2, and Gata-4 are implicated in
CLDN1 transcription (46, 47). Thus, our ﬁnding that claudin-1 is
strongly suppressed by endogenous B-RafV600E links its expression
to a clinically relevant oncogenic driver.
A major ﬁnding of our study is that the presence of B-RafV600E
suppresses CDX2 expression at the transcript and protein levels in
our three isogenic colorectal carcinoma cell line models. B-Raf or
MEK inhibition also induced Cdx-2 expression in MSS (HT29 and
Colo-205) and MSI (LS411 and HDC135) cells. Importantly, this
phenomenon was also observed in HT29 xenografts, which presented with Cdx-2–positive glandular epithelial structures upon
B-RafV600E knockdown or treatment with trametinib and, albeit to
a lesser degree, with vemurafenib. Cdx-2 represents a master
transcription factor regulating the differentiation, cell–cell adhesion, and polarity of intestinal epithelia (48), and indeed we
observe several Cdx-2 targets being upregulated by B-Raf/MEK
inhibition (Figs. 5B and 6A). The mechanisms controlling Cdx-2
expression are controversially discussed and implicate the Wnt,
Notch, JNK, and ERK pathways as well as epithelial–mesenchymal
transition regulators, epigenetic mechanisms, and the tumor
microenvironment (7, 43, 48, 49). Interestingly, knockdown of
Cdx-2 in Caco-2 cells disrupts cyst development (50), whereas its
ectopic expression in Colo-205 cells improved E-cadherin function and cell–cell adhesion in 2D culture (51). Thus, both studies
report phenocopies of experiments involving the ectopic expression or knockdown of B-RafV600E in Caco-2 cysts (23, 45) and
Colo-205 cells (Fig. 3), respectively. These striking parallels imply
that many aspects of the transformed phenotype evoked by BRafV600E are mediated by Cdx-2 loss. Our identiﬁcation of endogenous B-RafV600E as a Cdx-2 suppressor has clinical implications,
because its loss is observed at the invasive front and is implicated
in metastasis (43). Indeed, loss of Cdx-2 forecasts a poor prognosis and is frequently observed in right-sided colorectal carcinomas, which display a particularly high BRAF mutation rate
(2, 44, 52). Furthermore, loss of Cdx-2 expression in MSI and MSS
colorectal carcinoma tissue specimens is strongly correlated with
BRAFV600E and higher tumor grade (7, 53). Likewise, loss of
expression of the Cdx-2 target gene CLDN1, which we identiﬁed
as a B-RafV600E repressed gene, strongly predicts disease recurrence
and poor patient survival (54). Thus, our isogenic model systems
now provide a mechanism for the correlation between BRAF
mutation status, Cdx-2, and claudin-1 expression by showing a
dynamic and inverse relationship between B-RafV600E and the
expression of Cdx-2 and its targets such as CLDN1 and AMACR
(Figs. 5A and 6A). As Cdx-2 positively regulates a plethora of
differentiation markers (Supplementary Table S4), our study
suggests a mechanism for the aforementioned poor differentia-

tion status (1, 2, 11). The differentiation-suppressing effect of
oncogenic B-Raf is of particular interest in relation to recent
studies reporting a novel classiﬁcation system for colorectal
carcinomas based on gene-expression proﬁling (1, 2). These
studies show that BRAF-mutant colorectal carcinomas tend to be
less differentiated and often display a stem-like signature.
To our knowledge, we are the ﬁrst to describe the transcriptional
alterations induced by a B-Raf inhibitor in 3D cultures of two
colorectal carcinoma cell lines with an endogenous BRAFV600E
mutation. This identiﬁed transcripts associated with cellular
adhesion, invasion, and metastasis, which might represent potential prognostic colorectal carcinoma markers. Several of these
alterations at the transcript level were reﬂected at the protein
level, not only in the proﬁled HT29 and Colo-205 cells but also in
other colorectal carcinoma lines (Supplementary Fig. S4F). Some
of these transcripts are known from other tumor entities, but have
neither been implicated in colorectal carcinoma nor connected to
B-Raf signaling. For example, although Fascin1 has been implicated as a Wnt target gene in colorectal carcinoma (35), our data
show that B-Raf inhibition is sufﬁcient to block the expression of
this metastasis gene.
Furthermore, we identiﬁed B-RafV600E targets of ill-deﬁned or
unknown function. For example, KIAA1199 was signiﬁcantly
downregulated by B-Raf or MEK inhibition. KIAA1199 emerges
as a marker of poor prognosis in several tumor entities, including
colorectal carcinoma, but has never been linked to BRAF mutations before (39, 40, 55). Its activity as a promoter of cell
migration in noncolorectal carcinoma cell lines (55) ﬁts well to
the strong reduction of invasive behavior of Colo-205 cells with
inhibition or knockdown of B-RafV600E.
Thus, the identiﬁcation of the mechanisms and cooperating
signaling pathways by which oncogenic B-Raf suppresses differentiation and cell–cell adhesion represents a future task.
Collectively, we show that B-RafV600E inhibition reduces the
expression of transcripts associated with negative diagnostic
value and increases those forecasting a more favorable outcome. Moreover, the datasets derived from our dynamic isogenic experimental systems complement gene-expression studies based on the comparison of clinical and therefore heterogeneous tumor samples (1, 2, 9).
Our discovery that B-RafV600E inhibition improves cell–cell
adhesion by restoring AJs and TJs, impairs migration and invasion, and increases hallmarks of epithelial differentiation identiﬁes a novel facet of inhibitors targeting the B-Raf/MEK/ERK
pathway (Fig. 6B). Importantly, trametinib, which is part of
combination therapies trialed in colorectal carcinoma, yields the
same effects as B-Raf inhibitors in our 3D cultures and xenograft
experiments. This implicates MEK as a key mediator of the
differentiation suppression exerted by B-RafV600E. Although clearly beyond the scope of the present study, it would be interesting to
assess the sensitivity of our isogenic cell line models toward
conventional chemotherapy compounds, because differentiation
status is often correlated with drug responses. Taken together, our
study highlights the possibility for a novel therapeutic rationale
for using B-Raf/MEK/ERK pathway inhibitors in colorectal carcinoma and potentially other carcinoma entities. Thus, these drugs
could potentially limit metastasis, most likely, in combination
with conventional chemotherapy or other targeted therapy compounds such as EGFR or dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitors (4, 17–20).
Such combinations, which target various hallmarks of cancer, are
currently in clinical trials for colorectal carcinoma. It will be
