Abstract
The acquisition of drug resistance is a persistent clinical
problem limiting the successful treatment of human cancers,
including glioblastoma (GBM). However, the molecular
mechanisms by which initially chemoresponsive tumors develop therapeutic resistance remain poorly understood. In this
study, we report that Pol k, an error-prone polymerase that
participates in translesion DNA synthesis, was signiﬁcantly
upregulated in GBM cell lines and tumor tissues following
temozolomide treatment. Overexpression of Pol k in temozolomide-sensitive GBM cells conferred resistance to temozolomide, whereas its inhibition markedly sensitized resistant cells
to temozolomide in vitro and in orthotopic xenograft mouse
models. Mechanistically, depletion of Pol k disrupted homologous recombination (HR)-mediated repair and restart of
stalled replication forks, impaired the activation of ATR-Chk1
signaling, and delayed cell-cycle re-entry and progression.

Further investigation of the relationship between Pol k and
temozolomide revealed that Pol k inactivation facilitated
temozolomide-induced Rad17 ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation, subsequently silencing ATR-Chk1 signaling
and leading to defective HR repair and the reversal of temozolomide resistance. Moreover, overexpression of Rad17 in Pol
k-depleted GBM cells restored HR efﬁciency, promoted the
clearance of temozolomide-induced DNA breaks, and desensitized cells to the cytotoxic effects of temozolomide observed
in the absence of Pol k. Finally, we found that Pol k overexpression correlated with poor prognosis in GBM patients
undergoing temozolomide therapy. Collectively, our ﬁndings
identify a potential mechanism by which GBM cells develop
resistance to temozolomide and suggest that targeting the
DNA damage tolerance pathway may be beneﬁcial for overcoming resistance. Cancer Res; 76(8); 2340–53. 2016 AACR.

Introduction

alkylating drug temozolomide (1). Although these treatment
regimens have been shown to prolong survival, the prognosis
for patients with glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), the most
aggressive subtype, remains grim, with a median survival time
of approximately 14.6 months (2). Currently, temozolomide is
used as ﬁrst-line therapy for the treatment of GBM. However, the
durability of treatment response is frequently limited by development of drug resistance. Therefore, identifying novel mechanisms underlying acquired temozolomide resistance could provide
attractive novel molecular targets for GBM therapy.
Translesion DNA synthesis (TLS) is a major DNA damage
tolerance pathway that involves the recruitment of specialized
DNA polymerases to sites of stalled or collapsed replication forks
(3). Over the past decade, several specialized DNA polymerases
that catalyze TLS have been identiﬁed, including polymerase z
(Pol z), Pol k, Pol i, Pol h, and REV1. Most of these enzymes are
highly inaccurate and lack proofreading activity, which accommodate non-complementary bases in their active sites and allow
them to bypass a variety of DNA lesions caused by ionizing
radiation or DNA-damaging agents. Consequently, these lessstringent polymerases could potentially promote spontaneous
or DNA damage-induced mutagenesis (4). Increasing evidence
has shown that dysregulation of these mutagenic TLS polymerases
is frequently observed in a variety of cancers and could drive
genomic instability and tumorigenesis (5). Recently, it has been
reported that elevated levels of TLS components could enhance

Malignant glioma represents the most common and lethal
primary brain tumors in adults. The standard treatment of malignant glioma is multimodal, involving maximal surgical resection
followed by concurrent radiation and chemotherapy with the

Polymerase k Confers Temozolomide Resistance

DNA repair capacity, which allow cancer cells to acquire a drugresistant phenotype (6–9).
Pol k, encoded by the human DINB1 gene, lacks 30 –50 intrinsic
exonuclease activity and exhibits a high error rate when copying
undamaged DNA in vitro and in vivo (10, 11). Previous studies
have shown that Pol k expression was signiﬁcantly overexpressed
in non–small cell lung cancer, kidney cancer, and rectum cancer
(12–14). Moreover, overexpression of Pol k can directly promote
the emergence of a large spectrum of genetic alterations including
DNA breaks, loss of heterozygosity, and aneuploidy, thereby
contributing to genetic instability and tumorigenesis (15). Furthermore, ectopic Pol k expression leads to increased efﬁciency of
homologous recombination (HR), whereas knockdown of Pol k
triggers double-strand breaks (DSB) and render tumor cells more
sensitive to DNA-damaging drugs (15, 16). Our recent study has
demonstrated that Pol k is markedly overexpressed and associated
with adverse prognosis in patients with gliomas (17). However,
the role of dysregulated Pol k in GBM biology remains unknown.
In this study, we show that Pol k mediates HR repair and
temozolomide resistance in GBMs via Rad17-dependent activation of ATR-Chk1 signaling and may be leveraged as a novel
potential therapeutic target for GBMs, even in relapsed/refractory
settings.

Materials and Methods
Cell lines and reagents
The human GBM cell lines U87, A172, LN229, and LN118 were
purchased from the ATCC. The human GBM cell lines U251 and
T98 were obtained from RIKEN BioResource Center. All GBM cell
lines were validated in January 2012 by short tandem repeat DNA
ﬁngerprinting using the AmpFlSTR Identiﬁler kit according to the
manufacturer's instructions (Applied Biosystems). To maintain
authenticity of the cell lines, frozen stocks were prepared from
initial stocks, and every 3 months, a new frozen stock was used for
the experiments. Normal human astrocytes (NHA) were obtained
from Lonza and cultured in the provided astrocyte growth media
supplemented with rhEGF, insulin, ascorbic acid, GA-1000, Lglutamine, and 5% FBS. Primary cell lines that derived from GBM
surgical specimens were maintained in primary serum-free cultures
grown on laminin (18). Before each experiment, GBM cells were
cultured in DMEM, supplemented with 10% FBS, sodium pyruvate,
nonessential amino acids, L-glutamine, and a vitamin solution.
Patient tumors
Ten primary and the corresponding recurrent GBM patients
who received temozolomide therapy (each pair was from the
same patient) were all obtained from Department of Neurosurgery, the First Afﬁliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University
(Nanjing, China). One hundred and thirty-eight GBM patients
who underwent temozolomide treatment after surgery were
obtained from Department of Neurosurgery, the Second and
Fourth Afﬁliated Hospitals of Harbin Medical University (Harbin,
China), from 2002 to 2010. The histologic features of the specimens were independently examined by two neuropathologists
according to the WHO criteria. The clinicopathological and treatment characteristics of those patients are shown in Supplementary
Table S1 and Table S2. This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board and the ethics committee of Nanjing Medical
University and Harbin Medical University, and written informed
consent was obtained from all patients.

Results
Pol k is markedly upregulated in GBM cell lines and tumor
tissues after temozolomide treatment
First, we analyzed the levels of Pol k in normal human astrocytes (NHA) and six GBM cell lines (U87, U251, T98, A172,
LN229, and LN118) using qPCR and Western blot analysis,
respectively. Almost all of them, except A172, were found to
highly express Pol k in comparison with NHAs (Fig. 1A and
B). Previously, we and other groups have reported that TLS
polymerases can be activated by exposure to DNA-damaging
agents or ionizing radiation, thereby contributing to therapyinduced resistance (6, 19, 21).
To test whether Pol k could be induced upon exposure to
temozolomide, we examined the expression of Pol k mRNA and

2342 Cancer Res; 76(8) April 15, 2016

protein following temozolomide treatment. As shown in Fig. 1C,
the levels of Pol k mRNA and protein in U87 and T98 cells were
remarkably upregulated during the 32-hour post-incubation
period.
Next, we examined Pol k expression in 10 paired primary and
recurrent GBMs who were insensitive to temozolomide treatment.
As shown in Fig. 1D, the expression levels of Pol k in recurrent
samples were markedly increased compared with that in primary
samples. We further conducted an IHC analysis of Pol k and
observed a signiﬁcantly higher Pol k nuclear staining intensity in
the recurrent tumors compared with that in primary tumors (Fig.
1E). To control for cell line heterogeneity, we established two
primary cultured cell lines from the paired primary and recurrent
GBMs who showed the highest Pol k levels. We determined the
GBM-associated molecular markers, including the methylation
status of the MGMT promoter, the mutation status of the IDH 1
and 2, TP53 and K-Ras for the paired primary and recurrent GBM

Polymerase k Confers Temozolomide Resistance

cells in comparison to the original tumors. All of molecules and
their mutations were consistent between original tumor and cell
line pairs. Moreover, we analyzed cell viability and clonogenic
survival in two recurrent GBM cells after treating them with
temozolomide. The results revealed that both of the recurrent
GBM cells were resistant to temozolomide (Supplementary Fig.
S1) and showed signiﬁcant upregulation of Pol k (Fig. 1F and G).
We also detected the expression of MGMT, which is responsible
for temozolomide resistance, between the primary and recurrent
GBM cells. However, no differences were observed between the
cell line pairs (Fig. 1G), thus excluding the possibility that temozolomide resistance in recurrent GBMs is due to elevated expression of MGMT. Together, these results suggest that Pol k is
upregulated in GBM cell lines and tumor tissues upon temozolomide treatment, indicating a possible correlation between Pol k
and temozolomide resistance.
Pol k overexpression confers resistance to temozolomide
To determine whether Pol k is associated with temozolomide
resistance, we overexpressed Pol k in A172 cells (temozolomidesensitive cells lacking MGMT expression; Fig. 2A). We noted that
A172 cells expressing vector control had a signiﬁcant decrease in
colony-forming ability following temozolomide treatment,
whereas overexpression of Pol k in A172 cells signiﬁcantly rescued
the reduction of colony forming capacity by temozolomide (Fig.
2B). We also assessed apoptotic rate in A172 Pol k-overexpressing
cells or vector control cells in response to temozolomide. As
shown in Fig. 2C–E, a signiﬁcant reduction in number of apoptotic cells (Annexin V-PE/7-AAD or TUNEL-staining) with a
concomitant decrease in cleavage of caspase-3 was observed in
A172 Pol k-overexpressing cells compared with control cells.
These results indicate that Pol k overexpression protects temozolomide-sensitive GBM cells against temozolomide-induced
growth inhibition and apoptosis.
To examine whether Pol k confers resistance to temozolomide
in vivo, we subcutaneously injected A172 cells expressing Pol k or
vector control into immunocompromised mice. After conﬁrmation of GBM engraftment, mice were treated with temozolomide
(66 mg/kg/day) or placebo for 5 days per week for three cycles.
Mice injected with A172 cells expressing vector control had a
signiﬁcant decrease in tumor volume and weight when treated
with temozolomide, whereas tumor growth of temozolomidetreated xenografts overexpressing Pol k was almost not affected
(Fig. 2F–H). We also performed IHC analysis to verify cleaved
caspase-3 expression. Xenografts overexpressing Pol k had significantly decreased levels of cleaved caspase-3 upon temozolomide
treatment in comparison with control xenografts (Fig. 2I). Together, these ﬁndings indicate that Pol k overexpression contributes to
development of acquired resistance to temozolomide.
Pol k depletion sensitizes temozolomide-resistant GBM cells to
temozolomide
If gain-of-Pol k function could confer resistance to temozolomide in GBM cells, we asked whether loss of Pol k could cause
sensitization. We infected two temozolomide-refractory recurrent
GBM cells with three independent luciferase-encoding Pol k
shRNA or control shRNA. Altered expression of Pol k in recurrent
GBM1 and GBM2 cells was conﬁrmed by western blot analysis
(Fig. 3A). We chose shPol k-2 for the following study according to
its knockdown efﬁciency. After temozolomide treatment, Pol
k-depleted recurrent GBM1 or GBM2 cells showed a signiﬁcant

www.aacrjournals.org

reduction in colony-forming ability (Fig. 3B) and an increase in
apoptosis (Fig. 3C–E). Next, we investigated the role of Pol k
knockdown in the reversal of temozolomide resistance in vivo, 2.5
 105 luciferase-labeled Pol k-depleted recurrent GBM2 cells were
intracranially injected into NOD/SCID mice. The tumor-bearing
mice were treated with temozolomide (66 mg/kg/day) or vehicle
control for 5 days per week for three cycles. Tumor progression
was monitored using in vivo luminescence imaging. During 21day treatment, the control xenografts showed tumor progression.
In stark contrast, xenografts carrying Pol k-depleted recurrent
GBM2 cells displayed a signiﬁcant regression of tumor growth.
Representative images for luminescence images of tumor-bearing
xenografts and paralleled HE-stained orthotopic xenograft tumors
are given in Fig. 4A and B. Histologic analysis conﬁrmed that all
mice bearing tumors derived from Pol k-depleted recurrent GBM2
cells had a signiﬁcant decrease in Pol k expression (Fig. 4C). These
ﬁndings were further conﬁrmed by the survival curves, in which
temozolomide-treated Pol k-depleted xenografts exhibited signiﬁcantly increased survival as compared with temozolomidetreated control xenografts (Fig. 4D). Together, these data suggest
that inhibition of Pol k sensitizes temozolomide-refractory recurrent GBM cells to temozolomide in vitro and in vivo.
Pol k depletion induces a delay in HR-mediated DNA repair
Previous studies have reported that TLS polymerases may
accelerate DNA repair capacity and contribute to resistance against
multiple DNA-damaging agents (7, 8). Thus, we wondered
whether Pol k is involved in the repair of temozolomide-induced
DNA damage. Consistent with the previous ﬁndings (22, 23), we
found that Pol k displayed subnuclear foci formation in the
recurrent GBM2 cells after exposure to temozolomide (Fig.
5A). Pol k foci per cells gradually decreased to about 4 hours
and almost disappeared 12 hours after treatment. We next
knocked down endogenous Pol k in recurrent GBM1 and GBM2
cells with siRNA and employed the bromodeoxyuridine (BrdUrd)
comet assay to survey DNA repair progression. The detectable tail
moment almost disappeared after 12-hour temozolomide removal in control cells, indicating that DSB clearance was completed.
However, the process of DSB clearance was severely inhibited in
Pol k-depleted recurrent GBM1 and GBM2 cells 12 hours after
temozolomide withdrawal (Fig. 5B). These data suggest that cells
lacking Pol k were less able to repair temozolomide-induced DNA
lesions. To further investigate the role of Pol k in temozolomideinduced damage and repair process, we assessed the effects of Pol
k depletion on g-H2AX, a sensitive marker of DSBs, by counting
g-H2AX foci following temozolomide. Although the average
number of g-H2AX foci was similar in control siRNA and Pol k
siRNA cells within 30 minutes after temozolomide removal, the
number of g-H2AX foci in control siRNA cells began to decrease
within 2 hours after temozolomide removal, whereas Pol k siRNA
cells had a constantly high number of g-H2AX foci (Fig. 5D and E),
even at 12 hours, suggesting that Pol k knockdown delayed the
repair of temozolomide-induced DNA damage. We also performed the quantiﬁcation of g-H2AX using ﬂow cytometry to
conﬁrm this result. Consistently, Pol k siRNA cells had a much
higher percentage of active foci compared with control siRNA cells
from 2 to 12 hours after temozolomide withdrawal (Fig. 5F). In
addition, using immunoblotting assay, we observed persistence
of high levels of g-H2AX in Pol k siRNA recurrent GBM1 and
GBM2 cells but not cells transfected with control siRNA 12 hours
after the end of temozolomide treatment (Fig. 5C).

HR pathway is an evolutionarily conserved process that plays a
pivotal role in DSB repair and restart of stalled replication forks.
On the basis of the results that Pol k is required for DSB
elimination, we asked whether Pol k directly impacts HR repair,
we assayed for HR-mediated repair of an I-SceI–induced DSB, in
U87 cells, using a recombination substrate DR-GFP. We observed
a signiﬁcant 3-fold decrease in the number of GFP-positive cells
after Pol k depletion (Fig. 5G), indicating a speciﬁc defect in HR

2344 Cancer Res; 76(8) April 15, 2016

repair is, at least in part, due to the compromised Pol k function.
Moreover, we determined whether loss of Pol k is associated with
a defect in the restart of stalled replication forks using DNA ﬁber
technique. As shown in Supplementary Fig. S2A–S2C, knockdown of Pol k in U87 cells blocked replication-fork restart and
new origin ﬁring. Together, these data suggest that Pol k is
required for HR-mediated DSB repair and restart of stalled replication forks at the DNA damage sites.

Pol k depletion impairs ATR-Chk1 signaling pathway and
delays cell-cycle re-entry and progression
To explore the mechanism underlying Pol k-mediated HRmediated repair and temozolomide resistance, we examined
the expression of major HR-related proteins, including BRCA1,
BRCA2, and RAD51, in recurrent GBM1 and GBM2 as well as
U87 cells. However, the levels of these proteins were not altered
after Pol k knockdown (Supplementary Fig. S3A). Recent studies have shown that ATR-Chk1 and ATM/Chk2 pathways, two
primary kinase signaling cascades activated in response to DNA
damage, are involved in HR-dependent DNA repair and can
protect cells from DNA damage-induced cytotoxicity during
chemotherapy (24, 25). This prompted us to determine whether disruption of Pol k could affect the canonical ATR/Chk1 and
ATM/Chk2 signaling pathways. As shown in Fig. 6A, knock-

down of Pol k in recurrent GBM1 and GBM2 cells led to a
signiﬁcant decrease in the phosphorylation of Chk1 at Ser317,
at Ser345, and ATR at Ser428 with a concomitant increase in
g-H2AX levels 2 hours after temozolomide removal. However,
Pol k depletion did not affect ATM and Chk2 total protein
levels, and their phosphorylation status (data not shown).
Parallel experiments were performed in Pol k-depleted U87
cells treated with temozolomide, and similar results were
observed (Fig. 6A). ATR-Chk1 pathway is a critical regulator
of the cellular response to DNA damage and replication stress,
and interruption of this signaling may result in the impairment
of the S-phase checkpoint function and also abrogate G2–M
checkpoint activation (26). Thus, we wondered whether Pol k
could impact S or G2 checkpoint responses to temozolomideinduced DNA damage. After 2 to 12 hours of temozolomide

Polymerase k Confers Temozolomide Resistance

delays cell-cycle reentry and progression after the genotoxic
stress.
Pol k depletion increased temozolomide-induced Rad17
polyubiquitination and proteasomal degradation, leading to
ATR-Chk1 signaling inactivation, defective HR repair, and the
reversal of temozolomide resistance
ATR-dependent checkpoint signaling is mediated by protein
complex formation on damaged chromatin (27). Rad17 is phosphorylated by ATR, and the Rad17 phosphorylation facilitates
activation of Chk1 (28–30). Moreover, Claspin, together with
Plk1, is also an essential protein for the ATR-Chk1–dependent
activation of the DNA replication checkpoint response (31–33).
To conﬁrm the effect of the Rad17 phosphorylation by ATR, we
treated U87 cells with 1 mmol/L VE-821, a speciﬁc ATR inhibitor, 1
hour before 200 mmol/L temozolomide. Indeed, inhibition of
ATR by VE-821 resulted in a signiﬁcant reduction in the phosphorylation of Rad17 at Ser645 (Supplementary Fig. S4). We next
assessed the effect of Pol k depletion on the levels of Rad17 and its
phosphorylation at Ser645 as well as Claspin and Plk1. As shown
in Fig. 6B, knockdown of Pol k in recurrent GBM1 and GBM2 as
well as U87 cells markedly decreased the total levels and phosphorylation states of Rad17 two hours after temozolomide
removal, whereas the levels of Claspin and Plk1 were not altered
by silencing of Pol k. Consistent with the in vitro ﬁndings, the
expression of Rad17 and its downstream phosphorylation target
p-Chk1 (Ser345) were signiﬁcantly reduced in the tumor xenografts derived from Pol k-depleted cells compared with that in
control xenografts (Fig. 4D).
We next determined how Pol k affects Rad17 expression. To
that end, we ﬁrst performed qPCR to measure Rad17 mRNA
expression in control cells and cells with Pol k knockdown.
However, no signiﬁcant difference of Rad17 mRNA expression
was observed after Pol k depletion (Supplementary Fig. S5A), thus
ruling out the possibility that Rad17 expression was regulated at
the mRNA level by Pol k. It has been reported that Rad17mediated DNA damage response (DDR) is modulated by proteolysis (34). Thus, we sought to examine whether Pol k regulates
Rad17 protein stability in response to temozolomide-induced
DNA damage. As shown in Fig. 6C, Rad17 protein degradation
was induced by 200 mmol/L temozolomide for 8 hours, whereas
Pol k knockdown dramatically reduced the half-life of Rad17
from about 8 hours to less than 2 hours after cellular exposure to
temozolomide. Moreover, we treated U87 Pol k-depleted or
control cells with the proteasome inhibitor MG132 in the presence of temozolomide. As shown in Fig. 6D, MG132 restored the
expression levels of Rad17 and p-Rad17 (Ser645) in cells with Pol
k depletion. These data suggest that Pol k could regulate Rad17
protein stability via a proteasome-dependent pathway. It is
known that the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) promotes
the proteasomal degradation of target proteins. Thus, we asked
whether Pol k mediates temozolomide-induced Rad17 proteolysis via the UPS. U87 Pol k-depleted or control cells were transiently cotransfected with plasmids encoding Myc-tagged ubiquitin and HA-tagged Rad17, and incubated with 200 mmol/L temozolomide. Depletion of Pol k in U87 cells signiﬁcantly increased
the temozolomide-induced pattern of Rad17 protein levels with
drastic drop polyubiquitination compared with the control cells 2
hours after temozolomide withdrawal (Fig. 6E). Parallel experiments were performed in A172 cells overexpressing Pol k. We
found that overexpression of Pol k in temozolomide-treated A172

www.aacrjournals.org

cells resulted in a signiﬁcant decrease in the ubiquitination level of
Rad17 (Fig. 6F). Previous have shown that Rad17 phosphorylation contributes to stabilization of Rad17 (28). To determine
whether Pol k-induced stabilization of Rad17 involves phosphorylation, we constructed Ser645Ala and Ser645Asp phosphorylation site mutants of Rad17 and assessed their steady-state expression in the presence of Pol k. WT or mutant Rad17 was coexpressed with Pol k or vector in temozolomide-treated A172 cells
in the presence of MG132. We observed that the Rad17 Ser645Ala
or Ser645Asp mutant did not respond to Pol k-induced upregulation, whereas the WT Rad17 was upregulated by Pol k (Fig. 6G).
Moreover, we assessed the ubiquitination of Rad17 in the presence of Pol k and found that Pol k reduced the ubiquitination
level of WT Rad17 but not that of the Rad17 S148A or Ser645Asp
mutant in response to temozolomide (Fig. 6H). Thus, these data
suggest that Pol k regulates temozolomide-induced Rad17 ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation, and Rad17 phosphorylation at Ser645 is indispensable for Pol k-induced Rad17
stabilization.
To further determine whether Rad17 is involved in Pol k-mediated HR repair and temozolomide resistance, we overexpressed
Rad17 in Pol k-depleted recurrent GBM2 and U87 cells, and
reduced Rad17 expression in A172 Pol k-overexpressing cells. Pol
k-depleted recurrent GBM2 and U87 cells with ectopic expression
of Rad17 displayed signiﬁcantly higher levels of Chk1 phosphorylation at S345 and lower levels of g-H2AX 1 and 2 hours after
temozolomide withdrawal relative to control cells (Fig. 6I).
Moreover, forced expression of Rad17 restored the reduced HR
efﬁciency caused by Pol k depletion (Fig. 6K) and promoted the
clearance of temozolomide-induced DNA breaks (Fig. 6L). Conversely, knockdown of Rad17 in A172 Pol k-overexpressing cells
had lower levels of Chk1 phosphorylation at S345 and higher
levels of g-H2AX (Fig. 6J) as well as greater residual DNA damage
(Supplementary Fig. S5D). Consistent with the DNA repair assays,
overexpression of Rad17 rescued the effect of Pol k knockdown on
temozolomide-induced loss of clonogenic survival (Supplementary Fig. S5B) and apoptosis (Supplementary Fig. S5C), whereas
antagonizing Rad17 expression in A172 Pol k-overexpressing cells
rendered the resistant cells sensitive to temozolomide in vitro and
in vivo (Supplementary Fig. S5E–S5H). Together, these data suggest that inhibition of Pol k promotes temozolomide-induced
Rad17 polyubiquitination and proteasomal degradation, leading
to ATR-Chk1 signaling inactivation, defective HR repair, and the
reversal of temozolomide resistance.
Pol k overexpression correlates with Rad17, p-Chk1 (S345),
and g-H2AX (S139) protein levels and poor prognosis in GBM
patients receiving temozolomide therapy
To validate the association between Pol k and Rad17, p-Chk1
(S345) and g-H2AX (S139) in GBM patients, we performed IHC
staining of these four proteins on the tissue microarrays containing a cohort of 138 GBM patients receiving temozolomide therapy. A highly signiﬁcant correlation between Pol k and other three
proteins was observed in these GBM specimens. Tumors with high
level of Pol k tended to express high levels of Rad17, p-Chk1
(Ser345), and low levels of g-H2AX (S139), whereas tumors with
low level of Pol k tended to express low levels of Rad17, p-Chk1
(Ser345) and high levels of g-H2AX (S139; Fig. 7A and B). Finally,
we assessed whether Pol k levels are associated with temozolomide efﬁcacy. Kaplan–Meier survival analysis showed that
patients with high Pol k expression levels (n ¼ 75) had much

Polymerase k Confers Temozolomide Resistance

for temozolomide resistance in GBMs. We initially detected
paired primary and recurrent GBM patients who are insensitive
to temozolomide treatment and observed that Pol k expression
was substantially enhanced in recurrent temozolomide-refractory
GBMs than that in primary GBMs. Moreover, we showed that Pol
k mRNA and protein expression could be induced upon exposure
to temozolomide. Furthermore, ectopic expression of Pol k in
temozolomide-sensitive cells promoted acquired resistance to
temozolomide, whereas depletion of Pol k sensitized temozolomide-refractory cells to temozolomide in vitro and in patientspeciﬁc orthotopic GBM xenograft models. These data are further
supported by the ﬁndings that xenografts expressing low levels of
Pol k exhibited signiﬁcantly better survival when treated with
temozolomide compared with xenografts expressing high levels
of Pol k. Consistent with the above ﬁndings, the clinical datasets
from ours and TCGA demonstrate that GBM patients with low
level of Pol k would beneﬁt from temozolomide-based therapy.
Thus, our ﬁndings shed insight on the importance of Pol k in
temozolomide resistance and the applicability of Pol k as a
potential prognostic and predictive marker of response to temozolomide. Of note, a recent study has performed high-throughput
screening to identify inhibitors of Pol k (35). Although systemic
delivery of Pol k inhibitors into the brain crossing the blood-brain
barrier remains challenging, the effect of Pol k depletion on the
reversal of temozolomide resistance strongly suggests that further
efforts toward development of anti-Pol k therapeutics are fully
warranted.
Pol k could interact with other TLS polymerases, recruit them to
the site of DNA damage, and facilitate the bypass of a variety of
DNA lesions, such as ICLs (10, 11). Pol k has also been implicated
in the repair of DSBs (16). The results of a recent study showed
that overexpression of Pol k induced enhanced HR (15). However, the potential role of Pol k in modulating DSBs by HR
remains largely unclear. In the present study, we provide direct
evidence to demonstrate that Pol k is required for HR-mediated
DSB repair and restart of stalled replication forks at the DNA
damage sites. We discovered that Pol k could accumulate at DNA
lesions and form nuclear foci in drug-treated cells. Inhibition of
Pol k led to enhancement of H2AX phosphorylation and g-H2AX
foci formation as well as compromised HR repair and impaired
replication fork restart. We propose that Pol k overexpression may
improve the efﬁciency of HR, thereby contributing to the emergence of chemoresistant phenotype. On the basis of our ﬁndings
and other previous reports, Pol k may facilitate different DNA
repair programs including both TLS and HR repair in response to
DNA damage, possibly depending upon the type and location of
the lesion. Future studies are needed to address the initiation,
collaborative interactions and/or cross-regulation of these two
DDR pathways mediated by Pol k, and their active roles in
development of chemoresistance.
ATR is central to DDR and can be activated by a wide variety of
DNA events. When ATR is activated, it triggers a series of signaling
pathway and activates downstream cellular protein Chk1 (36). In
the absence of sufﬁcient ATR-Chk1 activity, DNA replication forks
tend to stall and eventually collapse (37). As a result, g-H2AX
accumulates and cell survival is impaired. Moreover, ATR-Chk1
pathway is a key early event during checkpoint signaling in
response to DNA damage. Indeed, the present study showed that
silencing of Pol k could disrupt the ATR-Chk1 checkpoint activation in response to temozolomide-induced DNA damage,
leading to delayed cell-cycle re-entry and progression. Rad17 is

www.aacrjournals.org

a critical DDR protein that serves as a major phosphorylation
substrate of ATR (28). The phosphorylation of Rad17 is required
for its interaction with Claspin, which mediates the ATR-dependent phosphorylation of Chk1 (29, 30, 38). Recent studies have
shown that dysregulation of Rad17 is associated with multiple
types of cancers (39–42). Overexpression of Rad17 could disrupt
cellular response to chemotherapeutic drug-induced DNA damage and favor tumor cell survival. Conversely, disrupting Rad17
expression or enhancing Rad17 proteolysis could shake tumor cell
genome stability and sensitize tumor cells to various chemotherapeutic drugs or ionizing radiation (34, 43). In our study, we
identiﬁed Pol k as a key regulator that mediates Rad17 stabilization via UPS-mediated proteolysis and found that Rad17 phosphorylation site at Ser645 is essential for Pol k-induced Rad17
stabilization. Importantly, we demonstrated that Pol k inhibition
might facilitate temozolomide-induced Rad17 polyubiquitination and proteasomal degradation, resulting in ATR-Chk1 signaling inactivation, defective HR repair, and the reversal of temozolomide resistance. In addition, we discovered that enforced
expression of Rad17 in Pol k-depleted cells signiﬁcantly reversed
the effect of Pol k knockdown on ATR-Chk1 signaling and HR
efﬁciency as well as clonogenic survival and apoptosis, whereas
abrogating Rad17 expression in Pol k-overexpressing cells rendered the resistant cells sensitive to temozolomide. Thus, our
ﬁndings unveiled the connection between Pol k-Rad17 proteolytic regulation and temozolomide resistance, which provide
novel insights into therapy-induced temozolomide resistance and
anti-GBM therapy.
Collectively, we showed that Pol k is critical in modulating HR
repair and temozolomide resistance in GBMs through Rad17dependent activation of ATR-Chk1 signaling. Our study not only
reveals a novel mechanism underlying acquired temozolomide
resistance but also has important implications in the development of treatment strategies for temozolomide-resistant GBMs.
