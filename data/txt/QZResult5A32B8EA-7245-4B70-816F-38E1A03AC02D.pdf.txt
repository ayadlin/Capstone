ABSTRACT
Insulin/IGF-1 signaling involves phosphorylation/dephosphorylation of serine/
threonine or tyrosine residues of the insulin receptor substrate (IRS) proteins and
is associated with hormonal control of longevity determination of certain long-lived
mice. The stimulation of serine phosphorylations by IGF-1 suggests there is insulin/
IGF-1 crosstalk that involves the phosphorylation of the same serine residues. By
this mechanism, insulin and IGF-1 mediated phosphorylation of specific IRS-1 serines
could play a role in longevity determination.
We used fibroblasts from WT and Ames dwarf mice to examine whether: (a)
IGF-1 stimulates phosphorylation of IRS-1 serines targeted by insulin; (b) the levels
of serine phosphorylation differ in WT vs. Ames fibroblasts; and (c) aging affects the
levels of these serine phosphorylations which are altered in the Ames dwarf mutant.
We have shown that IRS-1 is a substrate for IGF-1 induced phosphorylation of Ser307,
Ser612, Ser636/639, and Ser1101; that the levels of phosphorylation of these serines are
significantly lower in Ames vs. WT cells; that IGF-1 mediated phosphorylation of
these serines increases with age in WT cells. We propose that insulin/IGF-1 cross
talk and level of phosphorylation of specific IRS-1 serines may promote the Ames
dwarf longevity phenotype.

INTRODUCTION

regulation of genes targeted by the insulin/IGF-1-signaling
pathway may contribute to physiological conditions
supporting longevity [7]. Thus, in the Ames mouse, IGF-1
also regulates the insulin signaling pathway suggesting the
involvement of insulin/IGF-1 crosstalk interactions.
Phosphorylation
of
serine/threonine
(Ser/
Thr) or tyrosine (Tyr) residues of the insulin receptor
substrate (IRS) proteins regulate insulin signaling [10].
Phosphorylation of the IRS Ser residues inhibits Tyr
phosphorylation thereby serving as a physiological
negative-feedback control mechanism [11]. Insulin
stimulated Ser phosphorylation observed in hyperglycemia
[12] or in response to proinflammatory cytokines [13-16]
suggests this as the mechanism of acute and chronic stress
mediated insulin resistance [17]. Thus, the stimulation of
Ser/Thr phosphorylation of IRS-1 (and IRS-2), impairs
its association with the insulin receptor (IR) thereby
inhibiting insulin-stimulated Tyr-phosphorylation of both
IRS-1 and IR [13, 18-21]. Control of IRS-1 signaling is
thus achieved by the differential phosphorylation of Ser/

The extended lifespan of the Ames and Snell dwarf
mice is attributed to the attenuation of the insulin/IGF-1
signaling pathways [1, 2]. In these mice GH deficiency
reduces production and circulating levels of insulin and
IGF-1 [1, 3]. Reduced IGF-1 signaling affects insulin
sensitivity suggesting that crosstalk occurs between IGF1 and insulin signaling [4].
Control of mammalian aging by IGF-1is based on
the increased longevity of hypopituitary growth hormone
(GH)-deficient mice in which reduced IGF-1 expression
and peripheral levels are characteristics of increased
lifespan [5-7]. Subsequent studies of mice heterozygous
for the IGF-1R [IGF-1R(+/-)] provided direct evidence that
IGF-1 plays a role in controlling mouse longevity [8, 9].
Low levels of circulating IGF-1 are, therefore, a common
feature of several long-lived mouse models (Ames, Snell,
and IGF-1R(+/-)). Decreased mRNA and protein pool levels
of the hepatic IGF-1 axis in Ames mice suggest that the

Thr and Tyr residues. These phosphorylations are part of
the physiological processes of longevity determination as
well as the development of insulin and IGF-1 resistance.
Phosphorylation of IRS-1 on Ser307. Ser612, Ser636/639,
and Ser1101 negatively regulate several functions of IRS1 which include: a) phosphorylation of Ser309 which
uncouples IRS-1 from the insulin receptor (IR); decreases
tyrosine phosphorylation and increases degradation of the
IR; b) phosphorylation of Ser612 and Ser636/639 reduces the
IRS-1/PI3-kinase association [11].
Although insulin and IGF-1 signaling are initiated
by specific receptors there is considerable crosstalk
between these pathways [4, 14, 22]. This raises the
question of whether insulin/IGF-1 crosstalk involves the
phosphorylation of the same IRS-1 Ser residues. By this
mechanism, insulin and IGF-1 crosstalk could regulate
longevity and the development of insulin and IGF-1
resistance [13].
In past studies we demonstrated that fibroblast
cultures derived from young and aged Ames dwarf mice
maintain their in vivo characteristics of resistance to
mitochondrial generated oxidative stress [23]. Based
on these observations we used these cells to address
the question of whether: (a) IGF-1 stimulates the
phosphorylation of the same IRS-1 Ser residues that are
targeted by insulin; (b) the levels of Ser phosphorylation
differ in WT vs. Ames dwarf fibroblasts; and (c) aging
affects the levels and pattern of IGF-1 stimulated Ser

phosphorylations.
We propose that the results of our experiments
would provide information on the mechanism by which
IGF-1 participates in the regulation of insulin-GH
signaling and the determination of longevity.

RESULTS
Multiple physiological functions, including
longevity determination and insulin/IGF-1 resistance are
regulated by IRS-1signaling involving phosphorylationdephosphorylation of numerous Ser/Thr and Tyr residues.
In these studies we examined whether IGF-1 stimulates the
phosphorylation of IRS-1 Ser307, Ser612, Ser636/639 and Ser1101
residues that are known to be phosphorylated in response
to insulin treatment, whether these IGF-1 stimulated
phosphorylations in Ames fibroblasts are consistent with
decreased insulin/IGF-1 pathway activity associated with
longevity.

IGF-1 stimulates IRS-1 Ser307 phosphorylation in
young and aged wild type, and aged Ames dwarf
fibroblasts
The longevity of Ames dwarf [Prop1(-/-)]
mice is attributed to decreased levels of tissue and
circulating insulin and IGF-1[1, 3] and the differential

phosphorylation of IRS-1 Ser residues may be part of
the mechanism that regulates the altered insulin/IGF1 signaling that promotes longevity. To address this we
examined whether IGF-1 stimulates phosphorylation of
the same IRS-1 Ser residues that are insulin-stimulated.
The responses by the young Ames fibroblasts and their
age-matched WT controls to IGF-1 treatment indicate
that Ser307 phosphorylation is stimulated in WT fibroblasts
by ~6-fold at 15 minutes and ~10-fold at 30 minutes and
remains elevated up to 60 minutes of treatment (Figure
1A and 1B). On the other hand phosphorylation of Ser307
is severely attenuated in the Ames-derived fibroblasts
suggesting that these cells maintain the characteristic
decreased levels of insulin/IGF-1 signaling associated
with Ames longevity.
There is a ~14-fold increase in the endogenous
level of IRS-1 Ser307 phosphorylation in aged WT and
dwarf fibroblasts (Figure 1C, 1D). Furthermore treatment
with IGF-1 did not further enhance phosphorylation
of Ser307 in either the aged WT or Ames fibroblasts.
Thus, in both cell types the elevated endogenous levels
of Ser307 phosphorylation and the loss of response
of IGF-1 suggest significantly altered physiological
functions. The significant endogenous derepression of
Ser307 phosphorylation in both WT and Ames untreated
fibroblasts, and loss of response to IGF-1 are indicative of
major alterations of metabolic functions.
Interestingly, the aged Ames fibroblasts show a
decreased level of Ser307 phosphorylation at 15, 30, and

60 minutes after IGF-1 treatment suggesting that the
phosphorylation is responsive whereas the WT fibroblasts
are refractive in that they maintain the elevated level of
Ser307 phosphorylation (Figure 1C and 1D). These results
suggest that functions regulated and inducible by P-Ser307
persist in the WT controls, but are attenuated and transient
in the Ames dwarf cells.

IGF-1 stimulates IRS-1 Ser612 phosphorylation in
young and aged wild type, and aged Ames dwarf
fibroblasts
The G protein-coupled receptor kinase-2 (GRK2)
is a Ser/Thr kinase that upon endothelin-1 (ET-1)
stimulation associates with IRS-1 thereby promoting ET-1
mediated Ser612 phosphorylation and IRS-1 degradation
[24]. GRK2 thus plays a role in chronic ET-1 induced
insulin resistance by inhibiting IRS-1. Elevated GRK2
functions as a negative regulator of insulin action by
interfering with G protein-q/11α subunit signaling. Thus,
upon ET-1 activation, GRK2 associates with IRS-1 and
promotes ET-1 mediated IRS-1 Ser612 phosphorylation and
degradation which is associated with insulin resistance
[24]. Furthermore, the phosphorylation of Ser612 is
uniquely associated with ET-1 and GRK2 in myocardial
ischemic injury [24, 25]; type 2 diabetes [26]. obesity and
hypertension [26, 27].
Our results show that IGF-1 stimulates the
phosphorylation of Ser612 in WT fibroblasts whereas

the Ames fibroblasts do not respond to this treatment
(Figure 2A and 2B). On the other hand the level of IGF-1
stimulated Ser612 phosphorylation in aged WT is similar
to that of the young fibroblasts whereas phosphorylation
of the Ames fibroblasts is significantly derepressed,
although the level of expression is lower than that of
the WT response (Figure 2C and 2D). The endogenous
levels of Ser612 phosphorylation are thus increased in both
aged WT and Ames fibroblasts and IGF-1 induces further
phosphorylation in both cell types. There are, however,
significant differences between WT and Ames fibroblasts
in that (a) young Ames fibroblasts are resistant to IGF-1
stimulated phosphorylation and (b) the inducible level of
Ser612 phosphorylation in the aged WT is similar to that
of the young cells and c) the level of induction of the WT
cells remains elevated for 60 minutes, whereas in the Ames
cells it peaks in 5 minutes and declines rapidly (Figure 2C
and 2D).

to IGF-1 stimulated phosphorylation of Ser636/639 which
could result in the reduced mTOR/S6K1 signaling,
attenuation of protein synthesis and decreased insulin
resistance. This is a characteristic of longevity in models
ranging from nematodes to mice. On the other hand
Ser636/639 phosphorylation is strongly induced by IGF1 in both aged WT and Ames fibroblasts which is a
characteristic of insulin resistance (Figure 3C and 3D).
The phosphorylation in the dwarf fibroblasts decreases
significantly at 30 minutes and 60 minutes whereas such a
decrease is delayed in WT cells. The sustained vs. transient
phosphorylation of Ser636/639 is indicative of differences in
metabolic characteristics such as protein synthesis and
insulin resistance.

IGF-1 stimulates Ser1101 phosphorylation in
young and aged wild type and aged Ames dwarf
fibroblasts

IGF-1 stimulates Ser636/639 phosphorylation
in young and aged WT and aged Ames dwarf
fibroblasts

Infusion of amino acids into humans leads to the
activation of S6K1 phosphorylation of IRS-1 Ser1101,
a reduction of IRS-1 function and insulin resistance in
skeletal muscle [29]. Mutation of this site blocks the
ability of amino acids to suppress IRS-1 Tyr and Akt
phosphorylation [29]. Phosphorylation of IRS-1 Ser1101
is increased in livers of obese db/db and WT, but not
S6K(-/-) mice maintained on a high protein diet. Nutrient
dependent activation of S6K1 is thus associated with
insulin resistance in mice and humans in part via Ser1101

The Ser636/639 residues are involved in the
regulation of protein synthesis (mTOR, S6K, ERK) and
degradation [28]. Our data show a strong stimulation of
Ser636/639 phosphorylation in young WT mice whereas it
is virtually non-responsive in dwarf fibroblasts (Figure
3A and 3B). Thus, the Ames fibroblasts are refractory

in response to IGF-1 in the aged WT fibroblasts that does
not occur in the young cells.

phosphorylation [29].
Young WT fibroblasts exhibit a significant level
of endogenous phosphorylation of Ser1101 and treatment
with IGF-1 results in further increased phosphorylation
at this site (Figure 4A, 4B). The peak of phosphorylation
occurs ~15 minutes after treatment and decreases by ~60
minutes to the level of untreated cells suggesting a rapid
response to and recovery from IGF-1 treatment in young
WT fibroblasts.
The endogenous level of Ser1101 phosphorylation in
young Ames mice is ~3-fold lower than the corresponding
untreated WT cells (Figure 4A and 4B). Furthermore, IGF1 treatment of the Ames cells showed a slight increase in
Ser1101 phosphorylation at 15 minutes compared to the WT
and at 30- and 60 minutes the level of phosphorylation
decreases to the level of untreated cells.
Similar analyses of the aged WT and dwarf
fibroblasts show that the endogenous levels of Ser1101
phosphorylation are significantly lower compared to the
young cells, i.e., ~3-fold in WT and ~2-fold in dwarf cells
(Figure 4C and 4D). The IGF-1 treated WT and dwarf
cells showed a similar response after 5 and 15 minutes
of treatment; at 30 minutes, however, the phosphorylation
was ~5-fold higher than its endogenous level which is the
same as that seen in the young WT fibroblasts. These data
indicate that the induction of IGF-1 phosphorylation of
Ser1101 is delayed in the WT aged cells. Furthermore, there
is a rapid loss of P-Ser1101 by 60 minutes so that the level
of phosphorylation by the WT fibroblasts is the same as in

DISCUSSION
Using genetically identical young and aged WT and
Ames dwarf fibroblasts we have identified specific Ser
residues of IRS-1 that are substrates for IGF-1 stimulated
phosphorylations and are the same as those for insulin
stimulated Ser phosphorylation. We thus propose that
this may be a crosstalk mechanism by which circulating
IGF-1 participates in the regulation of insulin sensitivity
and plays an important role in the hormonal balance
between GH and insulin thus enabling them to regulate
the same metabolic pathways [4]. Importantly, the levels
of endogenous and inducible phosphorylation of Ser307,
Ser612, Ser636/639, and Ser1101 are significantly higher in
the WT fibroblasts suggesting that these epigenetic
alterations in the Ames mice control the unique serine
phosphorylation patterns that determine the physiological
conditions of IRS-1 signaling associated with longevity.
We thus propose that epigenetic changes associated with
the hormonal deficiencies of the Prop1(-/-) mutation are
stabilized and maintained in fibroblasts derived from these
mice [23, 30, 31]
The IGF-1 mediated phosphorylation of IRS-1
Ser307, Ser612, Ser636/639, and Ser1101 is attenuated in Ames
cells. Since these phosphorylations regulate multiple

signaling pathways and metabolic processes the overall
reduced levels of phosphorylation will, for example, affect
levels of protein synthesis, fatty acid metabolism, glucose
metabolism and stress response activity characteristic
of the long-lived Ames mice [30, 31]. This is consistent
with the reported specificities of Ser phosphorylation that
include both normal and disease-associated metabolic
functions. An interesting example is the phosphorylation
of Ser612 which is virtually absent in the fibroblasts from
young Ames mice. Since phosphorylation of IRS-1
Ser612 is a physiological characteristic of cardiovascular
pathology [25, 32], type 2 diabetes [26], obesity and
hypertension [26, 27], our data suggest that the high
levels of phosphorylation of Ser612 in young WT mice
may promote cardiovascular pathology and also serve as
a marker of this disease as well as of aging. Alternatively,
the virtual absence of Ser612 phosphorylation in young
Ames fibroblasts and rapid loss of P-Ser612-IRS-1 by
aged Ames fibroblasts suggests a decreased risk of
cardiovascular disease associated with longevity. The
fact that phosphorylation levels are significantly elevated
in fibroblasts from aged WT and dwarfs suggest that this
increased endogenous activity and strong stimulation
of phosphorylation may represent major age-associated
changes in the IRS-1 targeted metabolic functions.
There is a significant difference between the
induction of Ser307, Ser612, and Ser636/639 phosphorylation
in aged WT vs. aged Ames fibroblasts. For example, the
level of phosphorylation in aged WT fibroblasts remains
elevated up to 60 minutes whereas the phosphorylation
declines after 15-30 minutes in the age-matched Ames
fibroblasts. Thus, the WT-specific, sustained and elevated
level of phosphorylated IRS-1 Ser residues may be part of
the mechanism of inhibition of IRS-1 activity associated
with resistance to insulin/IRS-1. On the other hand,
although the Ames fibroblasts respond strongly to IGF-1,
the decrease of Ser phosphorylation suggests this rapid
recovery may be the mechanism that protects against the
consequences of IRS-1 hyperphosphorylation.
The insulin/IGF-1 and mammalian mTOR pathways
are highly conserved physiological processes that
protect against the development of the aging phenotype.
The multiple physiological consequences of IRS-1
phosphorylations are seen in increased activation of the
mTOR pathway along with enhanced phosphorylation of
IRS-1 at Ser307 and Ser636/639 that occur in animal models
of insulin resistance [30]. Thus, activation of the mTOR
pathway leading to the down-regulation of IRS-mediated
signals is a negative feedback mechanism which may be
involved in the development of insulin resistance [33, 34].
Reduced insulin/IGF-1 signaling extends lifespan in both
invertebrates and vertebrates [35, 36]. Thus, low levels of
insulin and/or IGF-1 signaling (together with high insulin
and IGF-1 sensitivity) are physiological characteristics that
support extended lifespan of the Ames mutants [37]. That
deletion of IRS-1 extends lifespan and increases resistance
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

to several age-related pathologies in male and female mice
is further support of this mechanism [9, 36]. These studies
suggest that reduced IRS-1 dependent signaling is a robust
mechanism for the modulation of mammalian lifespan.
It has been shown that the haploinsufficient IGF1R(+/-) mouse down regulates the principle pathways
stimulated by IGF-1 [8]. Embryonic fibroblasts derived
from Igf1r(+/-)mice showed a 50% reduction in IGF-1R
levels and a marked reduction in IGF-1 induced tyrosine
phosphorylation of its substrate, IRS-1. This suggests that
the down-regulation of IGF-1R in haploinsufficient mice
down-regulates the principal pathways stimulated by IGF1 and that the general decrease of IGF-1 via a decrease in
IGF-1R can increase mammalian lifespan [8].
Phosphorylation of IRS-1 Ser307 exemplifies a
common site that integrates heterologous inhibition of
insulin signaling by multiple factors (See Ref.15 for a
detailed Table). For example, Ser307 phosphorylation is
stimulated by insulin, IGF-1, TNFα [38], anisomycin
[36], fatty acids [39], amino acids [10] and C-reactive
protein [40]. Our studies suggest that IGF-1 may act
synergistically with these factors to promote Ser307
phosphorylation [41] and attenuation of IRS-1 and its
targeted downstream pathways, e.g., PI3K and MAPK
pathways [40, 42].
We propose that crosstalk between insulin and
IGF-1 signaling is mediated by the phosphorylation/
dephosphorylation of Ser/Thr and Tyr residues, and that
this is the mechanism of regulation of the major pathways
that target physiological functions associated with
longevity determination.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Isolation and treatment of Ames mouse tail
fibroblasts
The isolation of fibroblasts from young (3-6 mos)
and aged (21-24 mos) wild-type and Ames dwarf mice
has been described [23]. In this study, the fibroblasts at
passage 4 or 5 were plated in 100 mm2 cell culture dishes
(2x105 cells/dish) and cultured for 3 days in DMEM
medium containing 15% FBS. The day before treatment,
the medium was replaced with a medium containing
0.5% FBS. The recombinant human IGF-1 (Sigma) was
prepared in distilled H2O and filter sterilized. The IGF-1
stock solution (25 ng/ml) was diluted in DMEM medium
containing 0.5% FBS and the fibroblasts were treated
with IGF-1 at a final concentration of 2 ng/ml. The cells
were harvested and cytoplasmic and nuclear extracts were
prepared [23]. The protease and phosphatase inhibitors
were added to the extraction buffers prior to use [23]. The
protein concentration of the extracts was determined using
Bradford reagent (Bio-Rad).
