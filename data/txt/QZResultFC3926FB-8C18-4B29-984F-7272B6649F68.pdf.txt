BACKGROUND. Thalidomide is an antiangiogenic agent with immune modulating
potential. The objective of this study was to determine response rates among
women who were treated for recurrent ovarian cancer using topotecan with or
without thalidomide.
METHODS. Women were enrolled in this multicenter, prospective, randomized
phase 2 trial between April 2001 and July 2005. Eligible patients had recurrent
epithelial ovarian carcinoma with measurable disease or elevated CA 125 values.
Patients had received prior platinum-based chemotherapy. Treatment arms

received topotecan at a dose of 1.25 mg/m2 on Days 1 through 5 of a 21-day
cycle with or without thalidomide starting at a dose of 200 mg per day and then
increasing the dose as tolerated. Toxicity was graded according to the National
Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria. The chi-square test was used to
assess differences in response and toxicity, and the log-rank test was used to
compare Kaplan-Meier survival curves.

RESULTS. The analysis included 69 women (39 women in the control arm and 30
women in the thalidomide arm). Known prognostic factors, including platinum
sensitivity, were represented equally in each arm. The median thalidomide dose
was 200 mg per day. The overall response rate in the control arm was 21% (complete response [CR] rate, 18%; partial response [PR] rate, 3%) compared with 47%
in the thalidomide arm (CR rate, 30%; PR rate, 17%) (P 5 .03). The median progression-free survival for the control arm was 4 months compared with 6 months
in the thalidomide arm (P 5 .02). The median overall survival was 15 months in
the control arm and 19 months in the thalidomide arm (P 5 .67). Toxicities were
similar between groups.

CONCLUSIONS. The addition of thalidomide to topotecan for the treatment of
recurrent ovarian cancer appears to improve response rates, and the authors
believe that it warrants study through larger phase 3 trials. Cancer 2008;112:331–9.

varian cancer is the leading cause of death from gynecologic
malignancies and the fifth most common cause of cancer death
among women in the U.S.1 The development of new chemotherapy
options has improved the 5-year and 10-year survival for women
who are diagnosed with this disease; however, because an estimated
15,000 women die from ovarian cancer annually, there is a need for
new, more effective treatment options.

used widely in Europe until its teratogenic effects led
to its withdrawal from the market in 1961. Further
research has suggested that the teratogenicity of
thalidomide results from its ability to inhibit angiogenesis and neovascularization.2 It has been demonstrated that thalidomide inhibits basic fibroblast
growth factor-induced and vascular endothelial
growth factor (VEGF)-induced angiogenesis, stimulates the degradation of tumor necrosis factor a, and
reduces cellular values of interleukin 6 (IL-6) and IL12.3,4 The immune-modulating effects of thalidomide
include inducing the production of interferon g, IL-2
and IL-105 and enhancing cell-mediated immunity
through costimulation of T cells.6 Thalidomide alters
adhesion molecule expression7 and suppresses urokinase receptor expression.8 All of these mechanisms
have the potential to inhibit tumor growth, making
thalidomide an attractive agent for the treatment of
cancer.
The cytotoxicity of topotecan (GlaxoSmithKline,
London, U.K.) results from its binding to topoisomerase-1. By binding to and stabilizing topoisomeraseDNA complexes, topotecan induces double-strand
DNA breakage. Topotecan has been approved by the
U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the
treatment of recurrent ovarian cancer. There is some
evidence that topotecan has an inhibitory effect on
endothelial cells, inhibiting angiogenesis in vivo at
rates similar to TNP-470, another potent angiogenesis inhibitor.9
Based on the array of mechanisms of action
offered by thalidomide and topotecan and their antiangiogenic properties, we hypothesized that the
combination of these 2 drugs would be more effective in the treatment of recurrent or persistent
epithelial ovarian cancer than topotecan alone. To
test this hypothesis, we designed a prospective randomized trial to compare the response rates after
treatment with thalidomide and topotecan with the
response rates after treatment with topotecan alone
in women with recurrent epithelial ovarian, fallopian
tube, or primary peritoneal cancer.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Population
This study was coordinated by the University of
Minnesota Women’s Cancer Center, and patients
were recruited from this and 6 additional sites. The
institutional review boards at each site approved the
protocol. Participants had histologically diagnosed
epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer and, although primary pathology reports
were reviewed, we did not perform a central pathol-

ogy review of specimens from the initial diagnosis.
Eligible participants had 1 of the following diagnoses:
1) persistent cancer after primary chemotherapy with
a platinum- and taxane-based regimen or 2) their
first or second recurrence. To be enrolled at the
time of the second recurrence, patients had to have
platinum-sensitive disease (disease recurrence occurring >6 months after the completion of their initial treatment with a platinum- and taxane-based
regimen) and either must have developed disease
progression during treatment of this recurrence or
had to be within 6 months of completing their second course of platinum-based chemotherapy. Recurrent or persistent disease was diagnosed by physical
examination or an imaging study that identified disease measuring 2 cm or by a rising CA 125 value
that was above normal. Patients had to have adequate hematologic counts (hemoglobin 10 g/dL,
white blood cell count 3,000/mm3, platelets
100,000/mm3), normal renal function (creatinine
1.5 mg/dL) and liver function (serum bilirubin 2
mg/dL; aspartate and alanine aminotransferase
values and alkaline phosphatase value 2 times the
upper limit of normal), and a Gynecologic Oncology
Group performance status 2. Patients were ineligible if they had previously received topotecan or thalidomide, had a history of other malignancies (except
nonmelanoma skin cancer), were receiving immunotherapy or radiation therapy, or were of child-bearing potential. Patients had to be willing and able to
comply with the FDA-mandated System for Thalidomide Education and Prescribing Safety (S.T.E.P.S.)
program. Patients agreed to abide by the birth-control and pregnancy testing requirements of the
S.T.E.P.S. program.
Although the use of anticoagulants was not dictated by the protocol, the majority of patients (all
those who were treated at the University of Minnesota)
received warfarin at a dose of 1 mg per day while
they were on the protocol. When this trial was
initiated, anticoagulation was the standard of care at
our institution for women with subcutaneous intravenous ports. During the course of the study, this
policy changed; however, patients in this study were
continued on warfarin because of the reported risk
of thrombosis in cancer patients receiving thalidomide.

Treatment Plan
Women in the control arm received topotecan at a
dose of 1.25 mg/m2 intravenously as a 30-minute
infusion for 5 consecutive days every 21 days.
Although this is not the FDA-approved dose of topotecan, in the setting of recurrent ovarian cancer, this

reduced dose has been recommended for heavily
pretreated patients to decrease hematologic toxicity.10 In addition to topotecan at the dose described
above, patients in the experimental arm received oral
thalidomide starting at 200 mg per day. The thalidomide dose was increased by 100 mg per day every 14
days until patients experienced symptoms that we
believed were associated with thalidomide, including
severe constipation, somnolence, peripheral neuropathy, dizziness, rash, or nausea. In these situations,
the thalidomide dose was reduced by 100 mg per
day every 7 days until the side effect resolved. The
dose at which the patient no longer experienced side
effects was considered the maximum tolerated dose.
The maximum (not target) dose allowed was 800 mg
per day. All patients were given a bowel regimen consisting of dietary fiber, fluid intake, and laxatives to
avoid constipation.

Assessment
At each visit, patients had a physical examination, a
complete blood count with differential, platelet
counts, serum chemistries, and CA 125. Thalidomide
compliance was monitored by reviewing a patient diary at each visit. Patients were monitored for toxicity
before each cycle by completing a toxicity profile
and by physician/nurse assessment. In accordance
with the standard practice at the University of Minnesota,
tumor status was assessed after the third cycle of
topotecan. In the patients who had measurable disease, assessment was made by using the same modality that was used at the time of their enrollment.
Patients who were enrolled based on CA 125 were
assessed by computed tomography scan as well as
CA 125. Patients who had progressive disease after 3
cycles were removed from the protocol. Patients who
were removed from the trial continued to be followed for toxicity and survival data. Adverse events
were monitored by the principal investigator and the
Data Safety Monitoring Committee of the University
of Minnesota Cancer Center.
Endpoints
Our primary outcome was response, as determined
by the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors
(RECIST) criteria, in the patients who were enrolled
based on measurable disease.11 The use of CA 125 as
a measure of response in phase 2 trials was reviewed
by Guppy and Rustin.12 We used their criteria in the
current trial. For the patients who were enrolled
based on an elevated CA 125 value, a partial
response (PR) was defined as a 50% reduction in CA
125 when the value remained >30 U/mL if no new
disease was observed on imaging studies. A complete

333

response (CR) was defined as normalization of an
elevated CA 125 value with a reduction 50% from
the enrollment value, again, if there was no evidence
of new disease on imaging studies. Progressive disease was defined as an elevation of 25% in the CA
125 value. A CA 125 response was confirmed by
obtaining a repeat value within 60 days. Response
was assessed after the third and sixth courses of
topotecan or more frequently if warranted by symptoms or findings on physical examination. Secondary
outcomes included progression-free survival (PFS),
which was defined as the time from enrollment to
the diagnosis of progression of cancer, and overall
survival (OS), which was defined as the time from
enrollment to death. Toxicity was graded according
to version 2 of the National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria.

Statistical Analysis
Patients were assigned randomly to 1 of the 2 treatment arms at the time of enrollment. Prior to initiation of the trial, a computer-generated randomization
schedule was determined. Numbered cards designating the treatment arm were ordered according to the
list, and the cards were kept in opaque envelopes
and were not opened until the patient was registered
with the University of Minnesota clinical research coordinator. Randomization sequence was concealed
from investigators and staff. Neither the patients nor
the investigators were blinded to treatment arm.
Responses were assessed by radiologists who were
not a part of the trial and were blinded to treatment
arm.
Our trial included a heterogeneous population of
women with measurable disease or elevated CA 125
and with platinum-sensitive or platinum-resistant
disease. Therefore, we designed a randomized trial
that would allow us to assess better any relative difference in response rates. Then, these preliminary
data would be used as the basis for a larger phase 3
trial, perhaps in a more homogenous patient population, with traditional endpoints of OS or PFS. Our a
priori statistical analysis included a plan to compare
the 2 arms of this randomized phase 2 trial.
A preliminary report of single-agent thalidomide
for the treatment of recurrent ovarian cancer
described a response rate of 45%.13 That response
rate was based on changes in tumor size and CA 125.
In our sample size calculation, we used this response
rate as the expected response in our experimental
group. A large European study of women with recurrent ovarian cancer who received topotecan
described an overall response rate of 17%,14 and we
used that rate as the estimated response in our con-

trol group. Thus, accepting a type-1 error of 5% with
80% power, we would require 43 patients in each
treatment arm to detect the difference between an
overall response of 17% in the topotecan arm and
45% in the thalidomide/topotecan arm.
After a total of 50 patients were enrolled on the
protocol, an interim analysis was conducted on
response rate and toxicity of thalidomide. Using the
multiple testing procedure described by O’Brien and
Fleming,15 the level of significance for this interim
analysis was set at .005.
Toxicity was monitored on an ongoing basis. The
development of any grade 3 or 4 toxicity was considered an adverse experience. Stopping rules for toxicity were developed by using the FORTRAN program
BEST.16
All randomized patients who received at least 1
dose of topotecan or thalidomide were included in
the current analysis. The chi-square test was used to
determine whether the response proportions or toxicity differed between treatment arms. Log-linear
models were used to determine whether any of the
following factors were associated with response:
treatment arm, platinum sensitivity status, and criteria for enrollment (measurable tumor or elevated CA

125). Survival curves for PFS and OS were estimated
by using the Kaplan-Meier method and were compared between treatment groups by using the logrank test.

RESULTS
Between April 2001 and July 2005, 75 women, from 7
different research sites consented to participate in
this trial (accrual was terminated prematurely
because of financial restraints; after the 75th woman
was consented, no additional patients were enrolled
into this trial). Patients were followed for at least 6
months from the time of enrollment. Forty-one
women were randomized to receive topotecan alone;
of these, 2 women decided not to participate in the
trial before they received any medication, and they
were not treated by investigators associated with this
study. Thirty-four women were randomized to
receive thalidomide and topotecan; of these, 2
women worsened clinically before the initiation of
therapy and declined any further treatment, and 2
others withdrew before treatment. The final analysis
for response, survival, and toxicity included 39
women in the topotecan arm and 30 women in the

thalidomide/topotecan arm. The analysis included 4
women (2 in each arm) who either had protocol violations or did not receive full treatment according to
the protocol (Fig. 1).
The median number of completed cycles in both
treatment arms was 6. For patients in the experimental arm, the median thalidomide dose was 200 mg
per day (range, 100–600 mg per day). Dose escalation
was attempted in all patients. Seventy percent of the
patients received 200 mg or 300 mg per day for the
majority of their cycles. Two patients received 100
mg per day for the majority of their cycles; in both
patients, the dose reduction was caused by symptoms of fatigue and dizziness. The baseline demographics for the study participants are shown in
Table 1.
The overall response rate (CR 1 PR) for the
topotecan arm was 21% (8 of 39 patients) compared
with 47% (14 of 30 patients) for the topotecan/thalidomide arm (P 5 .036) (Table 2). Treatment arm,
platinum sensitivity status, and criteria for enrollment (measurable disease or elevated CA 125) were
each independent predictors of response. We used
the log-linear method to determine the odds of
response based on each predictor while controlling
for the other independent predictors. When controlling for other predictors of response, the patients
who were receiving topotecan and thalidomide were
10.4 times as likely to achieve a CR or PR (95% confidence interval [95% CI], 2.1–51.7; P 5 .004) as the
patients who were receiving topotecan alone. The
remaining predicting variables did not differ by study
arm. Those variables were platinum sensitivity (odds
ratio [OR], 36.4; 95% CI, 3.8–345.6 [P 5 .002]), plati-

Kaplan-Meier estimates of the median PFS for
women who were receiving topotecan was 4 months
(95% CI, 2.9–5.1 months) compared with 6 months
(95% CI, 4.2–7.7 months) for women who were
receiving topotecan with thalidomide (P 5 .02) (Fig.

and 18.8 months (95% CI, 13.9–33.1 months) for
women who were receiving topotecan and thalidomide (P 5 .67) (Fig. 3).
In the small subgroup of patients with platinumresistant disease, 1 of 11 women (9%) who were
receiving topotecan responded (CR 1 PR), and 3 of 9
women (33%) who were receiving topotecan and thalidomide responded. This subanalysis was performed

in the design of future clinical trials; the importance
of confirming this finding in larger clinical trials cannot be understated.
The only grade 3 or 4 toxicities experienced
by >20% of patients in either arm were considered
hematologic toxicities (Table 3). The rates of hematologic toxicities were similar except for grade 3 or 4
thrombocytopenia; which was observed with greater
frequency in women who were receiving thalidomide. None of the episodes of thrombocytopenia
resulted in dose reductions or dose delays. Hematopoietic growth factors were used in 24% of patients
in the control arm and in 31% of patients in the experimental arm. There also was similar use of granulocyte colony-stimulating factors (35% and 41% in
the control and experimental arms, respectively). Fatigue and somnolence were experienced at similar
rates in the control and experimental arms, although
somnolence was the primary symptom that lead to
dose reductions or prevented escalation of the thalidomide dose. The next most frequent toxicities that
lead to thalidomide dose reduction or preventing
escalation were lightheadedness or dizzy feelings,
neurotoxicity, and syncope. These were experienced
in 10% of women in the control arm and 33% of
women in the thalidomide arm, and the most frequent was grade 1 or 2 lightheadedness. Grade 1 or 2
constitutional toxicity was observed in 20 of 39
women (51%) who were receiving topotecan and in

dence of constipation and gastrointestinal toxicity
was similar between the arms. There was a trend toward increased incidence of peripheral neuropathy
and rash in women who were receiving thalidomide.
One patient was diagnosed with deep venous thrombosis (DVT); she was on the thalidomide arm at a
dose of 300 mg per day. The DVT was diagnosed in

Thalidomide and Topotecan in Ovarian CA/Downs et al.

her third cycle of chemotherapy and, during evaluation of the DVT, it was observed that she had disease
progression, and she was removed from the protocol.

DISCUSSION
The current findings support our hypothesis that the
response rate achieved with combination therapy
with thalidomide and topotecan is greater than the
response rate achieved with topotecan alone in
women with recurrent ovarian and primary peritoneal cancer. We observed an overall response of 47%
in the women who received topotecan and thalidomide. This compares with a response of 17% to
single-agent topotecan, a rate similar to that reported
in previous publications. In addition to improved
response, we observed a 2-month improvement in
disease-free survival. The observed 4-month improvement in OS was not statistically significant.
Patients who were receiving thalidomide were at
an increased risk for thrombocytopenia. There has
been a recent case report of isolated thrombocytopenia in a patient who was receiving maintenance thalidomide (200 mg per day) for multiple myeloma:
Within weeks of starting the maintenance dose, he
experienced grade 4 thrombocytopenia. The authors
of that case report suspect that peripheral platelet
destruction was the etiology of the thrombocytopenia.17 In our review, we did not identify other reports
of isolated thrombocytopenia in patients who were
receiving thalidomide.
Thalidomide is associated with an increased risk
of thromboembolic events, particularly when it is
used to treat hematologic malignancies and when it
is combined with dexamethasone. This risk does not
appear to be as great in patients with solid tumors,
and we did not observe an obvious increase in
thromboembolic events in our patients who received
thalidomide. Current guidelines do not recommend
the use of therapeutic or prophylactic anticoagulants
in patients with solid tumors.18 This may be particularly important considering the increased risk of
thrombocytopenia observed among the women in
our cohort who received thalidomide.
Early closure is a limitation of this study. Early
closure lead to an imbalance in the number of
patients in the treatment arms, and this imbalance
may have biased our analysis of PFS. Not meeting
our original accrual goal also may have limited the
precision of our estimates of overall response. Despite the smaller than planned accrual, we still
observed a significant difference in response between
treatment arms. We believe that this provides sufficient evidence that this regimen warrants further

337

study through larger phase 3 randomized trials in
women with recurrent ovarian cancer.
A second limitation is that there were no preclinical data to direct us in determining the optimal
thalidomide dose. Without this information, we may
have underestimated the potential impact of this
combination if higher doses of thalidomide would
have produced greater response rates.
Our patient population included women who
were diagnosed with recurrent disease by elevated
CA 125 levels without evidence of measurable disease. We believe that our randomized comparison
was adjusted for the finding that CA 125 response
occurs more frequently than measurable response.
The treatment arms contained similar proportions of
patients enrolled based on elevated CA 125 alone.
Although the numbers were small, the response rates
for the subgroups of patients enrolled based on
measurable disease and CA 125 alone mirrored the
overall response rates for each treatment arm (data
not shown).
To our knowledge, this is the first report in which
thalidomide has been combined with a cytotoxic
chemotherapy to treat ovarian cancer. Chan et al.
used single-agent thalidomide in a similar population and reported response rates of 18% based on
changes in the size of measurable disease and 47%
based on decreased serum CA 125 values.19 Eisen
et al. reported on a trial of low-dose thalidomide
(100 mg per day) in patients with advanced melanoma, renal cell carcinoma, breast cancer, and ovarian cancer. The highest response rate in their trial
was observed in patients with renal cell carcinoma
(17%), but no responses were observed in patients
with melanoma, breast cancer, or ovarian cancer. In
that trial, 1 of 19 women with ovarian cancer experienced stable disease for >3 months.20
Although to our knowledge there are few reports
of thalidomide use for ovarian cancer, it has been
studied in the phase 2 or 3 settings as a single agent
or in combination for the treatment of central nervous system tumors, renal cell carcinoma, prostate
cancer, and melanoma. Thalidomide has limited
activity in these cancers as a single agent; however,
its activity appears to be enhanced when thalidomide
is combined with certain cytotoxic agents. Three
reports described response rates from 5% to 12%
when single-agent thalidomide was used for the
treatment of glioblastoma or gliomas.21,22 However,
when thalidomide was combined with cytotoxic carmustine to treat gliomas, Fine et al. reported a
response rate of 24%.23 Single-agent thalidomide
trials in patients with prostate cancer have produced
response rates from 15% to 27%.24,25 In a rando-

mized trial of patients with recurrent prostate cancer,
investigators described a 50% reduction in the prostate-specific antigen level in 6 of 17 patients (35%)
who received docetaxel alone compared with 19 of
36 patients (53%) who received with docetaxel and
thalidomide.26
In a randomized trial of patients with metastatic
melanoma, investigators reported a response or disease stabilization in 20% of patients (95% CI, 10–
33%) who received temozolomide and in 25% of
patients (95% CI, 15–38%) who received temozolomide combined with thalidomide.25 Similar to our
results, those data suggest that combination therapy
with cytotoxic agents may be more effective than the
use of thalidomide as a single agent in the treatment
of solid tumors.
These clinical observations are supported by preclinical models demonstrating both the efficacy of
thalidomide and its synergy with cytotoxic agents. In
a xenograft model of melanoma, thalidomide
resulted in a 46% reduction in tumor growth compared with saline-treated animals. Furthermore, the
combination of thalidomide and darcarbazine
resulted in a 61% reduction in tumor size compared
with darcarbazine alone and in an additional 32%
reduction of tumor compared with thalidomide
alone.26
Kobayashi et al. described a murine model in
which thalidomide was combined with paclitaxel for
the treatment of ovarian cancer. Athymic nude mice
were injected with human ovarian cancer HRA cells
to create a model of intraperitoneal metastatic ovarian cancer. Compared with saline-treated animals,
there was a 25% reduction in tumor weight in animals that received thalidomide, and a 30% reduction
was observed in animals that received paclitaxel.
Although the combination of thalidomide and paclitaxel resulted in a 93% reduction in tumor weight,
the authors suggested that the broad mechanisms of
action attributable to the 2 agents, along with the
findings that both agents inhibited VEGF and
impaired angiogenesis, are the likely reasons for the
synergistic inhibition of ovarian cancer growth.27
To summarize, the results of the current study
have demonstrated that the administration of thalidomide and topotecan increases the response to
treatment in women with recurrent ovarian cancer.
Our preliminary data suggest that the thalidomide/
topotecan combination warrants evaluation through
a phase 3 trial that is powered to measure potential
differences in survival to assess the full potential of
this regimen. Our results also suggest that immune
modulators and antiangiogenic agents may be useful
therapeutically and should be studied in women

with recurrent ovarian cancer in combination with
traditional cytotoxic chemotherapy.
