Abstract
The NF-kB transcription factor family inﬂuences breast cancer outcomes by regulating genes involved in
tumor progression, angiogenesis, and metastasis. Dithiolethiones, a class of naturally occurring compounds
with cancer chemoprevention effects that have become clinically available, have been found to inhibit NF-kB
activity. However, the mechanism of this inhibition has not been identiﬁed, and the inﬂuence of dithiolethines on NF-kB pathway in breast cancer cells has not been examined. Here, we investigated the chemical
and biochemical effects of dithiolethione on NF-kB and downstream effector molecules in estrogen receptor–
negative breast cancer cells and murine tumor xenografts. The dithiolethiones ACS-1 and ACS-2 inhibited
NF-kB transcriptional activity. Interestingly, this inhibition was not due to H2S release or protein phosphatase 2A activation, which are key properties of dithiolethiones, but occurred via a covalent reaction
with the NF-kB p50 and p65 subunits to inhibit DNA binding. Dithiolethione-mediated inhibition of NF-kB–
regulated genes resulted in the inhibition of interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, urokinase-type plasminogen activator,
and VEGF production. ACS-1 also inhibited matrix metalloproteinase-9 activity, cellular migration, and
invasion, and ACS-2 reduced tumor burden and resulted in increased tumor host interactions. Together, our
ﬁndings suggest that dithiolethiones show potential clinical use for estrogen negative breast cancer as a
chemotherapeutic or adjuvant therapy. Cancer Res; 72(9); 2394–404. 2012 AACR.

Introduction
The NF-kB transcription factor family drives tumor progression and metastasis in many cancers by regulating genes
involved in inﬂammation, cellular survival, and proliferation
(1–3). In particular, NF-kB signaling is essential for estrogen
receptor–negative (ER) breast cancer tumorigenesis, progression, and metastasis (4–6). Furthermore, the role of NF-kB in
expressing proinﬂammatory cytokines and enzymes contribute to the strong correlation between inﬂammation and breast
cancer. Among the proinﬂammatory enzymes that are transcriptionally controlled by NF-kB are cyclooxygenase-2 (COX2) and inducible nitric oxide synthase (NOS2; ref. 2). COX-2 and

NOS2 expression in ER breast cancer is highly correlated with
poor patient prognosis (7, 8). The predictive value of NOS2 was
tumor-node-metastasis stage independent suggesting that NFkB activation of NOS2 may have a role in the initiation and
progression of the disease state (8). These ﬁndings, in addition
to many other reports, imply that pharmacologic targeting of
NF-kB activity may provide a unique mechanism to limit
cancer morbidity and mortality in patients with ER disease
(9–11).
Dithiolethione compounds, which are found in dietary
vegetables and are clinically available, have been reported to
inhibit NF-kB activity in multiple cell types and have been
shown to ameliorate the effects of lipopolysaccharide toxicity
in mice (12). This class of compounds has well-established
chemopreventive effects in humans. For example, 4-methyl-5(N-2-pyrazinyl)-1,2-dithiole-3-thione (oltipraz) increases aﬂatoxin metabolism and decreases the risk for aﬂatoxin-induced
hepatocellular carcinoma, while 5-[p-methoxyphenyl]-1,2dithiole-3-thione (anethole dithiolethione; ADT) is efﬁcacious
in limiting bronchial dysplasia in smokers (13, 14). Dithiolethiones exert their chemopreventive effects, in part, by
activating the Nrf2 transcription factor that binds to the
antioxidant response element on the promoter region of target
genes (15, 16), in addition to inhibiting the xenobiotic response
element, which is responsible for carcinogen activation (17).
Beyond activation of Nrf2, dithiolethiones increase the activity
of the tumor suppressor protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) that

Dithiolethiones Inhibit NF-kB in Breast Cancer

inhibits oncogenic Akt and c-myc signaling (18). Modiﬁed
nonsteroidal anti-inﬂammatory drugs (NSAID) such as diclofenac and valproic acid (VPA) with an ADT-like moiety and
have shown that these agents reduce lung cancer xenograft
volume and exhibit antiangiogenic properties (19, 20).
Because dithiolethione compounds exhibit multiple anticancer properties, the effects of ADT-like molecules (ACS-1,
ACS-2, and ACS-92) were investigated in ER breast cancer cell
lines and focused on NF-kB activity and target gene products
involved in tumor proliferation and metastasis. Previous
reports show opposite effects of dithiolethiones (ADT and
oltipraz) on NF-kB activation and DNA binding (21, 22) and
here a series of ADT-based ditholethiones (ACS compounds) is
examined in ER breast cancer cells. ADT-based dithiolethiones inhibited NF-kB activity by forming a covalent
modiﬁcation with NF-kB subunits to inhibit NF-kB binding
to its DNA consensus sequence. Furthermore, ACS-1 inhibited
the production of NF-kB–regulated molecules involved in
tumor progression and metastasis, such as interleukin-6 (IL6), IL-8, VEGF and urokinase-type plasminogen activator
(uPA). ACS-1 also inhibited the activity of matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9), which is involved in tumor metastasis.
Using a mouse xenograft model, ACS-2 drastically reduced
tumor burden and reduced tumor IL-6, IL-8, uPA, and VEGF.
These data suggest that dithiolethione compounds, which are
clinically available, may have beneﬁcial effects in ER breast
cancer chemotherapy.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture
Human breast adenocarcinoma cell lines MDA-MB-231 and
MDA-MB-468 (American Type Culture Collection, ATCC) were
cultured in Dulbecco's Modiﬁed Eagle's Medium (DMEM; Invitrogen) containing 10% FBS (Atlanta Biologics) and 100 IU
penicillin and 100 mg/mL streptomycin (Invitrogen). Cells were
cultured at 37 C in 5% CO2 and passaged 2 to 3 times per week.
Drs. Aldona Karaczyn and Joseph Verdi (Center for Molecular
Medicine, Maine Medical Center Research Institute) kindly
provided the MDA-MB-231 cells stably transfected with GFP,
which were cultured as described above. The cell lines have been
authenticated by short tandem repeat proﬁling (ATCC).
Statistical analyses
Data analyses were conducted with Prism 4 software
(GraphPad Software, Inc.). Statistical signiﬁcance was
achieved with P < 0.05. One-way ANOVA analyses with the
Dunnett posttest were compared with control values as indicated in ﬁgure legends. Tumor IL-6, IL-8, VEGF, uPA, and GFP
values were analyzed by unpaired t test with a 1-tailed P value.
Detailed Materials and Methods are available in Supplementary Data.

Results
Clinical association between NOS2 expression and NF-kB
activity
High tumor NOS2 expression is associated with a poor
outcome in ER breast cancer patients; more than 90% of

www.aacrjournals.org

the deceased patient within our cohort had elevated expression of NOS2 (8). In addition, high NOS2 expression results in
the upregulation of 44 genes in the tumors of these patients
(8). Genomic analyses reveal that most (31 of 44; 70%) of
these genes contain at least 1 NF-kB consensus sequences in
their respective promoter regions (Supplementary Table S1).
Also, NF-kB contributes to the expression of the basal-like
phenotype by nitric oxide (NO) as 48% (15 of 31) of genes
containing an NF-kB promoter sequence are known basallike signature genes (Supplementary Table S1 and Fig. 1A).
Overall 34% (15 of 44) of NOS2 associated genes have
both NF-kB promoter sequences and are basal-like markers
(Fig. 1A), suggesting that NO signaling, NF-kB activation, and poor patient outcomes may be mechanistically
linked. To investigate the role of NO on NF-kB activation,
ER MDA-MB-468 breast cancer cells were transfected
with an NF-kB luciferase reporter construct and treated
with the NO donor DETANO for 24 hours. A chemical NO
donor was used because these cell lines do not express NOS2,
and the use of DETANO allows for the generation of consistent and controlled NO concentrations. DETANO caused
a concentration-dependent increase in luciferase activity
compared with untreated control cells and similar to
TNF-a–treated positive control cells (Fig. 1B). Statistical
signiﬁcance was achieved at 0.5 and 1 mmol/L concentrations of the donor, which are the same concentrations that
signiﬁcantly increased IL-8 production and cell migration in
our previous report (8). These observations establish a
mechanistic link between NF-kB signaling, NO-mediated
inﬂammation, the basal-like phenotype, and ER patient
survival (Fig. 1C). Therefore NO is a physiologically relevant
stimulator of NF-kB activity in ER breast cancer patients
and targeting NF-kB activity may have beneﬁcial effects in
limiting this disease state.
Dithiolethiones inhibit NF-kB transcriptional activity in
ER breast cancer cells
The dithiolethiones used in this study are shown in
Fig. 2A. ACS-1 is the paraphenol analog of ADT. ACS-2 and
ACS-92 are formed from the conjugation of VPA and biotin,
respectively, with ACS-1 (12). As previously reported, these
compounds hydrolyze to release hydrogen sulﬁde (H2S;
ref. 12). ACS-1 in media containing 10% FBS rapidly released
H2S as measured by a selective electrode (Fig. 2B). To
measure the ability for ACS-1 and ACS-2 to inhibit NF-kB
transcriptional activity, MDA-MB-231 cells were transiently
transfected with an NF-kB luciferase reporter plasmid and
incubated for 18 hours with the compounds and TNF-a. In
addition to the dithiolethiones, the metabolites VPA and
the conjugate base of H2S, sodium hydrosulﬁde (NaSH), were
also examined in this assay. ACS-1 and ACS-2 inhibited
NF-kB–dependent transcription of luciferase similar to
untreated controls with an IC50 < 12.5 mmol/L, while VPA
and NaSH did not alter luciferase production at the concentrations examined compared with TNF-a controls
(Fig. 2C). These data indicate that the dithiolethione moiety
of these compounds, not metabolites (i.e., H2S and VPA), are
responsible for inhibiting NF-kB transcriptional activity.

ACS-1 does not alter IKK signaling or NF-kB nuclear
translocation
Dithiolethiones activate PP2A phosphatase activity (18).
PP2A negatively regulates NF-kB activity by dephosphorylating IKK-b (23). To examine the role of PP2A activity in
the ACS-1 inhibition of NF-kB, MDA-MB-231 cells were
treated with ACS-1 alone or with the PP2A inhibitor okadaic
acid (OA) for 2 hours before stimulation with TNF-a for
5 minutes. TNF-a stimulation resulted in marked phosphorylation of IKK-b, IkBa, and p65 (Fig. 3A). TNF-a–stimulated
cells pretreated with either ACS-1 alone or ACS-1 and OA
resulted in hyperphosphorylation of IKK-b, IkBa, and p65
indicating that ACS-1 does not inhibit NF-kB via increased
PP2A activity (Fig. 3A). The hyperphosphorylation of IKK-b
was also observed in cells treated with a range of ACS-1
concentrations while ACS-1 did not prevent the degradation
of IkBa in response to TNF-a after 30 minutes (Fig. 3B).
Using the NF-kB luciferase assay, ACS-1 inhibited NF-kB

transcriptional activity in the presence of OA, indicating
that PP2A activity is not involved in the inhibition of NF-kB
by ACS-1 (Fig. 3C). To examine whether ACS-1 altered the
kinetics of the NF-kB p50 subunit translocation to the
nucleus, MDA-MB-468 cells were treated with or without
50 mmol/L ACS-1 for 2 hours and then stimulated with
TNF-a. Cells were harvested at the indicated times and the
nuclear p50 content was analyzed by Western blot (Fig. 3D).
ACS-1 did not alter the rate of p50 nuclear translocation in
response to TNF-a suggesting that ACS-1 does not interfere
with the signaling cascade or nuclear localization of NF-kB
subunits involved in NF-kB activation.
ACS-1 inhibits NF-kB–DNA binding
Because ACS-1 did not alter NF-kB signal transduction or
nuclear translocation upon TNF-a stimulation, the effect of
dithiolethiones on NF-kB binding to DNA was investigated.
MDA-MB-468 cells were treated with ACS-1, ACS-2, ACS-92,

or NaSH for 2 hours before TNF-a stimulation and compared with untreated cells. Nuclear fractions were isolated
after 30 minutes of TNF-a stimulation and NF-kB binding
to its consensus DNA sequence was measured by gel shift
assay (Fig. 4A). TNF-a stimulation resulted in modest
increases in DNA oligonucleotide retardation compared
with untreated controls, which was eliminated upon incubation with unlabelled DNA. ACS-1, ACS-2, and ACS-92
inhibited NF-kB binding in a concentration-dependent
manner, however up to 50 mmol/L NaSH/H2S did not reduce
NF-kB binding, however modest decrease in binding was
observed at 100 mmol/L NaSH. These data indicate that
dithiolethiones inhibit NF-kB binding to DNA independent
of H2S release, consistent with NF-kB luciferase results

in Fig. 2C. Furthermore, 50 mmol/L biotin did not reduce
NF-kB binding to DNA indicating that the dithiolethione
moiety of ACS-92 is responsible for the inhibition of NF-kB
binding.
Because dithiolethiones inhibited NF-kB binding to its DNA
consensus sequence, the effect of ACS-1 to alter the DNAbinding ability of recombinant NF-kB subunits was further
examined. Recombinant human p50 or p65 (1 mg/100 mL) was
incubated with ACS-1 and DNA binding was measured using
an ELISA-based assay with immobilized NF-kB consensus
sequences. ACS-1 inhibited both p50 and p65 DNA binding in
a concentration-dependent manner as shown in Fig. 4B with an
apparent IC50 of approximately 250 nmol/L in this recombinant system.

streptavidin bond is commonly used for protein pull-down
experiments. MDA-MB-231 whole-cell lysate was treated with
ACS-92 or biotin for 10 minutes and bound proteins were
pulled down using streptavidin-conjugated beads. Western
blotting revealed that p50 was present in the cell lysate (load
lane) and was pulled down by ACS-92 but not by biotin alone,
indicating that the dithiolethione moiety physically interacts
with the NF-kB subunit (Fig. 4C). Similarly, p65 was also pulled
down by ACS-92, but not biotin (Fig. 4C). To explore the nature
of this interaction, a similar pull-down assay was conducted
with MDA-MB-231 whole-cell lysate and the bound protein
was eluted off the beads in loading buffer containing 5% 2mercaptoethanol (2-ME) or loading buffer alone. Both p50 and
p65 subunits were released from the ACS-92–conjugated bead
only in the presence of 2-ME (Fig. 4D), indicating that a
disulﬁde bond had been formed between the NF-kB subunit
and ACS-92, as summarized in Fig. 4F. In addition, ACS-92 did
not pull down p50 or p65 from cell lysates pretreated with Nethyl maleimide (Fig. 4D). Furthermore, MDA-MB-231 cells
were pretreated with the thiol-blocking agent iodoacetic acid
(IAA) followed by ACS-92 exposure and compared with
untreated cells. Whole-cell lysates were then incubated with
streptavidin beads and bound protein was eluted in the
presence of 2-ME. ACS-92 pull down of p50 and p65 was
measured by Western blot analyses. p50 and p65 were not
detected in untreated cells, indicating that the association
between NF-kB subunits and the streptavidin beads was not
nonspeciﬁc. Both p50 and p65 were pulled down from ACS-92–
treated cells, however, IAA pretreatment markedly decreased
the ability of ACS-92 to associate with and pull down p50 and
p65 subunits (Fig. 4E), indicating that protein thiols are
required for interaction with dithiolethiones as shown
in Fig. 4F. These data indicate that dithiolethione compounds
covalently interact with p50 and p65 via disulﬁde formation.

30 minutes of TNF-a stimulation. IKK-b (ser 180) phosphorylation and
total IkBa protein levels were measured by Western blot analysis and
compared with actin. C, serum-starved MDA-MB-468 cells transiently
transfected with NF-kB luciferase reporter construct were incubated
24 hours with TNF-a, ACS-1, and OA as shown. Luciferase activity was
measured and normalized to fold increase over untreated controls. Mean

subunit nuclear accumulation was measured by Western analysis of
MDA-MB-468 cells pretreated with ACS-1 or vehicle (DMSO) before

Dithiolethiones form disulﬁde bonds with NF-kB

Due to the inhibition of NF-kB–DNA binding by dithiolethiones, the direct chemical modiﬁcation of NF-kB subunit
by dithiolethiones was investigated. Biotin-labeled ACS-1

Dithiolethiones inhibit NF-kB–regulated target genes
involved in tumor inﬂammation and metastasis
Inhibition of NF-kB by dithiolethiones suggests that the
production of downstream target genes would also be decreased. NF-kB regulates the transcription of genes that
have roles in tumor progression and metastasis such as IL-6,
IL-8, VEGF, and uPA. Serum-starved MDA-MB-231 and
MDA-MB-468 cells were treated with TNF-a and ACS-1 for
24 hours. TNF-a treatment alone resulted in increased
expression of IL-6, IL-8, uPA, and VEGF compared with
untreated serum-starved controls. ACS-1 resulted in the
marked decrease in IL-6, IL-8, uPA, and VEGF secreted by
the TNF-a–stimulated cells (Fig. 5A). Cell viability after 24
hours was determined in ACS-1–treated cells by measuring
total cellular ATP levels. ACS-1 did not cause a signiﬁcant
decrease in cellular viability up to 100 mmol/L (Fig. 5B),
indicating that the decrease in IL-6, IL-8, uPA, and VEGF are
due to NF-kB inhibition and not due to cellular toxicity.
An NF-kB consensus sequence is present in the promoter
region of the MMP-9 gene, which is essential for tumor cell
metastasis. ACS-1 did not alter the secretion of MMP-9 by
MDA-MB-231 cells over a wide concentration range as shown
in Fig. 5C, suggesting that MMP-9 transcription is not

dependent on NF-kB. However, MMP-9 proteinase activity of
conditioned media was signiﬁcantly inhibited by ACS-1 as
determined by zymography and quantiﬁed by densitometry
(Fig. 5D and E). To examine a potential chemical mechanism of
this inhibition of MMP-9 by dithiolethiones, human recombinant pro–MMP-9 was incubated with ACS-92 or biotin and
pulled down as described above. ACS-92 was able to pull down
the latent form of MMP-9 while biotin did not, indicating that
the dithiolethione moiety covalently reacts with MMP-9 to
inhibit its proteinase activity (Fig. 5F).

MDA-MB-231 cell motility is regulated by NF-kB–mediated production of uPA (24). To examine the effects of ACS-1
on cell motility, MDA-MB-231 cells were seeded onto Transwell plates in serum-free DMEM containing ACS-1 and cells
were allowed to migrate toward 5% FBS chemotractant for

in cell migration consistent with NF-kB and uPA inhibition
(Fig. 6A). ACS-1 also inhibited MDA-MB-231 invasion

due to cell death or cytostasis, MDA-MB-231 cells were

represent the mean ( SD, n ¼ 6) and
are shown as percent of untreated
controls. C, MDA-MB-231 cells were
seeded between Matrigel layers and
incubated with or with out ACS-1 for
14 days and Matrigel outgrowth was
photographed (magniﬁcation, 10).
D, MDA-MB-231 cells were exposed
to ACS-1 for 24 hours and assessed
for colony formation. The clonogenic
survival is represented as the mean
number of colonies formed ( SD, n

untreated controls.

Tumors were allowed to grow for 10 days at which time ACS-2
(20 mg/kg) or DMSO (vehicle control) was administered by i.p.
injection 3 times per week for 5 weeks. ACS-2 was used for in
vivo studies due to the rapid metabolism and poor pharmacokinetics of ACS-1 in mice. After 5 weeks of drug administration, the mice were anesthetized and in vivo tumor GFP
ﬂuorescence was measured. The ACS-2–treated mice had a
marked decrease in tumor GFP ﬂuorescence compared with
the DMSO-treated mice as shown in Fig. 7A–D. After in vivo
GFP measurements, the mice were euthanized and the tumors
were resected. Tumor sections were homogenized and GFP
ﬂuorescence was measured in the tumor homogenate and
normalized to total protein content (Fig. 7E). Final tumor
volumes were not signiﬁcantly different between the 2 groups
(Fig. 7F). Although the gross tumor volume was not signiﬁcantly reduced by ACS-2, the ACS-2–treated tumors had
signiﬁcantly lower relative GFP ﬂuorescence than control
tumors (P ¼ 0.0001), indicating that the tumor burden was
reduced in the ACS-2–treated mice.
Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E)-stained tumor sections
reveal that ACS-2 (Fig. 7G) caused decreased mitotic index
compared with DMSO-treated mice (Fig. 7H). ACS-2 also
increased intracellular vacuoles consistent with the antiangiogenic properties of dithiolethiones including decreased
VEGF production and MMP-9 activity. Histopathology

examination of tumor sections revealed that ACS-2 induced
necrosis throughout the tumor mass and the host was
unable to clear the necrotic cells from the tumor. The
potential loss of the GFP ﬂuorescence in response to chronic
ACS-2 treatment was examined by treating MDA-MB-231GFP cells to ACS-2 for 30 days. Under these conditions, the
cells retained GFP DNA vector and MDA-MB-231-GFP ﬂuorescence was not quenched by ACS-2 (data not shown).
These data indicate that ACS-2 does not eliminate the GFP
gene, inhibit GFP protein production, or physically interfere
with GFP ﬂuorescence.
To measure the potential increase of host immune response in ACS-2–treated mice, whole-cell lysates were
prepared from homogenized tumors and the relative
amount of CD14 was analyzed by Western blotting and
normalized to hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase
(HPRT). Densitometric analysis show that ACS-2-treated
tumors had an increased mean content of the monocyte
marker compared with DMSO controls, however the
increase did not achieve statistical signiﬁcance (Fig. 7I).
However, tumor content of human IL-8, uPA, and VEGF were
signiﬁcantly reduced in the ACS-2–treated mice compared
with DMSO control mice (Fig. 7J–L), indicating that tumor
burden and NF-kB activity was reduced by dithiolethione
treatment.

Discussion
NF-kB has a central role in inﬂammation and cancer. The
proinﬂammatory protein NOS2 is a strong prognostic marker
in ER breast cancer, and its expression is transcriptionally
regulated by NF-kB activity (2, 8). Our data indicate that the

2402

Cancer Res; 72(9) May 1, 2012

product of NOS2 catalysis, NO, activates NF-kB signaling
forming a positive feedback loop to enhance inﬂammatory
signaling in ER breast tumors. These results indicate that the
aggressive basal-like phenotype is promoted in part by NOS2/
NO/NF-kB pathway activation (Supplementary Table S1
and Fig. 1). These observations further highlight the clinical

Dithiolethiones Inhibit NF-kB in Breast Cancer

signiﬁcance of developing agents that inhibit NF-kB activity for
the treatment of ER breast patients.
Dithiolethiones have chemopreventative effects in humans
(13, 15, 26), however the data shown here indicate that this
class of naturally occurring compounds may also have effects
in cancer chemotherapy and/or adjuvant therapy. The results
presented here establish dithiolethione compounds as inhibitors of the tumor-promoting NF-kB signaling pathway in
estrogen-negative breast cancer cells. A prototypical dithiolethione ADT has been found to inhibit NF-kB activation in
human T cells, however the mechanism of this inhibition has
not been determined (22). A unique feature of dithiolethiones is
their ability to release H2S. A ditholethione-modiﬁed NSAID
has been shown to limit lipopolysaccharide-induced inﬂammation and NF-kB activity and H2S release was proposed to be
responsible for the observed effects (12). H2S has been shown to
reduce NF-kB activation in astrocytes and microglia cells (27).
However, from the data presented here, it seems that H2S has
no role in inhibiting NF-kB activity in breast cancer cells
treated with dithiolethiones. Another report indicates that
H2S increases proinﬂammatory cytokine production by activating NF-kB (28). These seemingly contradictory ﬁndings
indicate that the effects of H2S on NF-kB signaling are dependent on context and cell type and that the physiology of H2S
needs further elucidation.
The mechanism of NF-kB inhibition by dithiolethiones is via
covalent thiol modiﬁcation of NF-kB p50 and p65 subunits.
This is consistent with other observations that NF-kB subunit
cysteine oxidation or alkylation inhibits DNA-binding functions (29, 30). We conclude that the electrophilic nature of the
dithiolethione moiety is responsible for the covalent modiﬁcation of NF-kB subunits and are functionally similar to
alkylating agents.
NF-kB is a molecular target for anticancer therapies because
of the effects of NF-kB target genes on tumor proliferation and
microenvironment (2, 9). NF-kB regulated genes involved in
tumor progression, angiogenesis, and metastasis include IL-6,
IL-8, uPA, VEGF, and MMP-9 (2, 3, 9, 24, 31, 32). The dithiolethiones studied here reduced IL-6, IL-8, uPA, and VEGF
secreted by ER breast cancer cells consistent with NF-kB
inhibition. We predict that dithiolethiones may inhibit other
cancer-related transcription factors and therefore we cannot
rule out that the effects on cytokine production are solely due
to NF-kB inhibition. We are in the process of examining and
identifying other signaling pathways and transcription factors
altered by dithiolethiones (such as AP-1 and b-catenin). Many
protumor signaling pathways exhibit cross-talk and redundancy that has made targeting single pathways difﬁcult. However, the inhibition of cytokine production is indicative of the
overall antitumor effects of these compounds. Furthermore,
ACS-1 treatment inhibited the activity but not the production
of MMP-9, which is critical for tumor cell migration and
invasion. The inhibition of MMP-9 activity is further characterized by the inhibition of both cellular migration and invasion by ACS-1 in a concentration-dependent manner. These
results highlight the potential numerous beneﬁts of NF-kB
inhibition by dithiolethiones with respect to breast cancer
chemotherapy or adjuvant therapy.

www.aacrjournals.org

Despite the profound in vitro effects of dithiolethiones on
NF-kB activity and downstream gene products, administration of ACS-2 (20 mg/kg) to mice with MDA-MB-231-GFP
tumors implanted into the mammary fat pad did not alter
total tumor volume compared with vehicle control mice
upon gross measurements. However, the tumor burden was
markedly decreased in mice treated with ACS-2 as inferred
from in vivo and ex vivo tumor GFP measurements suggesting that ACS-2 may reduce the potential surgical or radiation
ﬁelds and improve therapeutic margins. The potential loss of
the GFP gene or GFP ﬂuorescence quenching by ACS-2 was
examined, however the dithiolethione did not alter the
presence of the GFP gene or ﬂuorescence of GFP expressed
in the MDA-MB-231 cell line. Furthermore, histopathologic
examination indicates that ACS-2 resulted in increased
tumor cell necrosis in the absence of host clearance, reduced
mitotic indices, and reduced tumor angiogenesis. From
these observations, it seems that the dithiolethione altered
tumor proliferation and/or host immune response to the
tumor. Furthermore, tumor levels of NF-kB regulated IL-8,
uPA, and VEGF were signiﬁcantly reduced, indicating that
dithiolethiones inhibit NF-kB activity in vivo and contributes
to the reduced tumor burden observed. These results indicate that dithiolethione treatment induces an antitumor
effect by inhibiting NF-kB.
In summary, dithiolethione compounds have potential
use in ER breast cancer as a chemotherapeutic or adjuvant
therapy as these compounds inhibit NF-kB and downstream
inﬂammatory molecules that promote tumor growth and
metastasis. This novel feature of dithiolethiones, in addition
to the antiangiogenic and tumor suppressor PP2A activation
properties already reported (18, 20), indicate that this class
of compounds have multiple anticancer properties and can
be considered a potential multitargeted pharmaceutical.
Furthermore, these compounds result in no observable toxic
side effects in vivo, are naturally occurring in dietary cruciferous vegetables, and ADT is currently a clinically available drug.
