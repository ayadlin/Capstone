Drug Resistance

Abstract
Bcl-2 is phosphorylated on Ser70 after treatment of cells with spindle poisons. On the basis of effects observed in
cells overexpressing Bcl-2 S70E or S70A mutants, various studies have concluded that Ser70 phosphorylation
either enhances or diminishes Bcl-2 function. In the present study, the ability of phosphorylated Bcl-2, as well as
the S70E and S70A mutants, to bind and neutralize proapoptotic Bcl-2 family members under cell-free conditions
and in intact cells was examined in an attempt to resolve this controversy. Surface plasmon resonance indicated
that phosphorylated Bcl-2, Bcl-2 S70E, and Bcl-2 S70A exhibit enhanced binding to Bim and Bak compared with
unmodiﬁed Bcl-2. This enhanced binding reﬂected a readily detectable conformation change in the loop domain
of Bcl-2. Furthermore, Bcl-2 S70E and S70A bound more Bak and Bim than wild-type Bcl-2 in pull-downs and
afforded greater protection against several chemotherapeutic agents. Importantly, binding of endogenous Bcl-2
to Bim also increased during mitosis, when Bcl-2 is endogenously phosphorylated, and disruption of this mitotic
Bcl-2/Bim binding with navitoclax or ABT-199, like Bcl-2 downregulation, enhanced the cytotoxicity of paclitaxel.
Collectively, these results provide not only a mechanistic basis for the enhanced antiapoptotic activity of
phosphorylated Bcl-2, but also an explanation for the ability of BH3 mimetics to enhance taxane sensitivity.

Introduction
Bcl-2 family members regulate apoptosis by controlling
mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization (1, 2). In
particular, the proapoptotic multidomain Bcl-2 family members Bax and Bak are thought to directly permeabilize the outer
mitochondrial membrane. Bax and Bak are held in check by
binding to the antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family members Bcl-xL, Mcl1, Bcl-w, and A1 as well as Bcl-2 itself. These interactions are
further modulated by BH3-only proteins such as Bim, Puma,
Bid, Noxa, Bik, Bad, and Bmf, which are activated by various
cellular stresses and then facilitate apoptosis by neutralizing
antiapoptotic family members and, at least in the case of Bid,
Bim, and Noxa, by directly activating Bax and/or Bak.
Not all of the antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family members interact
equally well with Bax and Bak. Even though the ﬁrst article
describing Bak showed that it could be pulled down with Bcl-2
(3), subsequent studies have reported that Bak binds Mcl-1 and
Bcl-xL preferentially (4, 5). On the other hand, our previous

studies demonstrated an equilibrium dissociation constant of
150 nmol/L for the Bcl-2Bak complex and demonstrated
that a sizable fraction of the total cellular Bak in certain
lymphoid cell lines, particularly those with Bcl-2 overexpression, could be pulled down with endogenous Bcl-2 (6).
Additional experiments examined the potential role of
phosphorylation in the protective effects of Bcl-2. Early studies
not only identiﬁed Bcl-2 as a phosphoprotein (7) that is
preferentially modiﬁed during mitosis (8, 9), but also suggested
that paclitaxel treatment might inactivate Bcl-2 through this
posttranslational modiﬁcation (10, 11). In particular, it was
reported that Bcl-2 S70A protected cells better than wild-type
Bcl-2, raising the possibility that Bcl-2 Ser70 phosphorylation
inhibits Bcl-2 function (12). In contrast, other studies have
demonstrated that phosphomimetic mutants with glutamate
substituted at amino acids Thr69, Ser70, and Ser87 also exhibit
enhanced antiapoptotic effects, leading to the suggestion that
phosphorylation enhances the activity of Bcl-2 (13, 14).
Although it was suggested that these conﬂicting observations
might reﬂect context-dependent effects of Bcl-2 phosphorylation (15), the mechanistic basis for either the proposed inactivation of Bcl-2 or its hyperactivation by phosphorylation
remains unclear. Moreover, whereas several studies implicated
cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (CDK1) as at least one possible Bcl-2
kinase (8, 16), other studies reported an inability of CDK1 to
phosphorylate Bcl-2 in vitro (12, 17).
Previous studies have also shown that ABT-737 and navitoclax, which antagonize the effects of Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, and Bcl-w,
dramatically sensitize a variety of cells to the cytotoxic effects
of paclitaxel (18–22). These observations have led to at least
two trials of navitoclax/taxane combinations (http://www.

Bcl-2 Phosphorylation, Bak Binding, and Paclitaxel Resistance

clinicaltrials.gov/). Largely on the basis of correlations between
Bcl-xL expression and sensitivity to taxanes, it has also been
suggested that the synergy between paclitaxel and ABT-737 or
navitoclax reﬂects inhibition of Bcl-xL. The possibility that a
form of Bcl-2 present mainly during mitosis plays an important
role in taxane sensitivity has not been investigated.
To resolve these issues, the present study was designed to
determine whether phosphorylation inhibits or enhances the
antiapoptotic function of Bcl-2, to examine the mechanistic
basis for the altered Bcl-2 function, and to assess the impact of
Bcl-2 phosphorylation on anticancer drug sensitivity. Results of
this analysis demonstrated that phosphorylated Bcl-2 or the
S70E mutant not only bound Bak and Bim with higher afﬁnity
under cell-free conditions, but also sequestered more Bim and
Bak in intact cells, leading to enhanced protection against
apoptosis. Interestingly, the Bcl-2 S70A mutant afforded similar protection, supporting a model in which Bcl-2 phosphorylation drives Bcl-2 to a more active conformation rather than
providing a charge modiﬁcation required for interaction with a
phosphoepitope-directed binding partner.

Materials and Methods
Materials
Reagents were obtained from the following suppliers: CM5
biosensor chips and Polysorbate 20 from GE Healthcare, Q-VDOPh from SM Biochemicals, glutathione (GSH) and paclitaxel
from Sigma, GSH-agarose and trypsin-TPCK from Thermo
Scientiﬁc, navitoclax and ABT-199 from Chemietek, activated
CDK1/cyclin B complex from Millipore, Ni2þ-NTA-agarose
from Novagen, and allophycocyanin (APC)-conjugated Annexin V from BD Biosciences. Antibodies to the following
antigens were purchased from the indicated suppliers: Bcl-2
from Dako; Bax, Bim, Bcl-xL, Mcl-1, green ﬂuorescent protein
(GFP), and glyceraldehyde phosphate dehydrogenase from Cell
Signaling Technology; Bak and Ser70-Bcl-2 from Millipore; and
actin (goat polyclonal) and Puma (rabbit polyclonal) from
Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Anti-S peptide antibody was raised
in our laboratory as described (23). The 26-mer Bim BH3
peptide (RPEIWIAQELRRIGDEFNAYYARRVF) was generated
by solid-phase synthesis in the Mayo Clinic Proteomics
Research Center (Rochester, MN).
Protein expression and puriﬁcation
Plasmids encoding His6-tagged BakDTM (GenBank
BC004431; residues 1–186) in pET29b(þ) and glutathione Stransferase (GST)–tagged Bcl-2DTM have been described previously (6). cDNA encoding Bcl-2DTM (GenBank BC027258;
residues 1–219) was also cloned into pET29a(þ), generating
the Bcl-2DTM protein with a C terminal His6-tag. Plasmids
encoding Bcl-2 mutants were generated using site-directed
mutagenesis. All plasmids were subjected to automated
sequencing to verify the described alteration and conﬁrm that
no additional mutations were present.
To express tagged BakDTM or Bcl-2DTM, plasmids were
transformed into Escherichia coli BL21 by heat shock. After
cells were grown to an optical density of 0.8, 1 mmol/L
IPTG (isopropyl-l-thio-b-1-D-galactopyranoside) was added to

induce protein synthesis at 18 C for 24 hours. Bacteria were
then washed and sonicated on ice in TS buffer [150 mmol/L
NaCl containing 10 mmol/L Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) and 1 mmol/L
freshly added PMSF]. All further steps were performed at 4 C.
After His6-tagged proteins were applied to Ni2þ-NTA-agarose, columns were washed with 20 volumes of TS buffer
followed by 10 volumes of TS buffer containing 40 mmol/L
imidazole and eluted with TS buffer containing 200 mmol/L
imidazole. After GST-tagged proteins were incubated with
GSH-agarose for 4 hours, beads were washed twice with 20–
25 volumes of TS buffer and eluted with TS containing 20
mmol/L GSH for 30 minutes at 4 C.
Fast protein liquid chromatography
Bcl-2DTM-His6, either wild-type or mutant, was further
puriﬁed by fast protein liquid chromatography (FPLC) on a
mono Q column with buffer A (50 mmol/L Na2HPO4, pH 8.5)
and buffer B (50 mmol/L Na2HPO4, 1 M NaCl, pH 8.5). The Bcl2DTM-containing fractions were subjected to SDS-PAGE.
In vitro phosphorylation and mass spectrometry
To achieve a high degree of modiﬁcation, 100 mg puriﬁed Bcl2DTM-His6 was incubated with 5 mg puriﬁed CDK1/cyclin B
complex at 30 C for 2 hours in buffer containing 1 mmol/L ATP,
1 mmol/L MgCl2, 150 mmol/L NaCl, and 20 mmol/L HEPES (pH
7.4). Aliquots of the reaction mixture were subjected to SDSPAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose, stained with fast green, and
blotted with anti-phospho-Ser70-Bcl-2 or subjected to liquid
chromatography (LC) on an Agilent 1200 LC system coupled
with electrospray ionization and time-of-ﬂight mass spectrometry (MS) on an Agilent 6224 TOF mass spectrometer (Mayo
Clinic Proteomics Core Facility, Rochester, MN). Alternatively,
aliquots of the same sample were also subjected to trypsin
digestion followed by nano-LC/MS-MS using an Eksigent nanoLC-2D high-performance liquid chromatography system (Eksigent, Dublin, CA) coupled with a Thermo Scientiﬁc Orbitrap
Elite hybrid mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc, Bremen, Germany) to identify phosphorylation sites.
Trypsin digestion
After 2.5 mg Bcl-2DTM-His6 (wild-type, S70A, S70E) was incubated with 5 ng Trypsin-TPCK in HEPES buffer (150 mmol/L
NaCl, 20 mmol/L HEPES, pH 7.4) for 30 minutes at 30 C, the
reaction products were subjected to SDS-PAGE and stained with
Coomassie blue G-250. An aliquot of trypsin-digested Bcl2DTM-His6 S70A was subjected to liquid chromatography
coupled with electrospray ionization and time-of-ﬂight MS as
described above to identify the two tryptic cleavage fragments.
Surface plasmon resonance
Proteins for surface plasmon resonance (SPR) were further
puriﬁed by FPLC on Superdex S200, concentrated in a centrifugal concentrator (Centricon, Millipore), dialyzed against
Biacore buffer [10 mmol/L HEPES (pH 7.4), 150 mmol/L NaCl,
0.05 mmol/L EDTA, and 0.005% (w/v) Polysorbate 20] and
stored at 4 C for less than 48 hours before use.
BakDTM or 26-mer Bim BH3 peptide (24) was immobilized on a CM5 chip using a Biacore T200 biosensor.

inactivated FBS, 100 units/mL penicillin G, 100 mg/mL streptomycin, and 2 mmol/L glutamine (Medium A), and passaged
less than 3 months before being reinitiated from frozen stocks.
Ovcar5 and Ovcar8 cells from the National Cancer Institute
(Frederick, MD; ref. 25) or A2780 cells from T. Hamilton (Fox
Chase Cancer Center, Philadelphia, PA) were maintained at
less than 80% conﬂuence in Medium A without (Ovcar5 and
Ovcar8) or with (A2780) 10 mg/mL insulin. After cells were
treated with paclitaxel in the absence or presence of navitoclax or ABT-199 for 24 or 48 hours as indicated in the individual ﬁgures, cells were harvested for assays of apoptosis,
which were performed as previously described (6). All cell lines
were authenticated by short tandem repeat proﬁling in the
Mayo Advanced Genomics Technology Center, most recently
in July 2012 and April 2013.
To compare the ability of various Bcl-2 constructs to protect cells, log-phase K562 cells were transiently transfected
with plasmids encoding wild-type or mutant full-length
Bcl-2 (40 mg), together with plasmid-encoding enhanced
GFP (EGFP)-histone H2B (5 mg), using a BTX 830 square
wave electroporator delivering a single 320-V pulse for 10
ms. After incubation to allow transgene exposure, cells were
treated with drugs or solvents as indicated in the Figs. 4 and
5. At the completion of the incubation, cells were sedimented at 50 g, reacted with APC-conjugated Annexin V, and

analyzed on a Becton Dickinson FACS Canto II ﬂow cytometer (Becton Dickinson) using the following lasers and
ﬁlters: EGFP, 488-nm laser, 530/30 ﬁlter; APC, 633-nm laser,
660/20 ﬁlter. After collection of 20,000 events, APC-Annexin
V binding to the EGFP-positive cells was determined using
Becton Dickinson Cell Quest software.
To evaluate the effects of downregulating various Bcl-2
family members, log-phase K562 cells growing in antibioticfree medium were electroporated with previously described
siRNAs (6) targeting Bim, Puma, Bak, or Bax (1 mmol/L). To
knock down antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family members, we used
two previously described short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs)
against Bcl-2 or Mcl-1 (6, 26), Bcl-xL (shRNA #1) generated
by inserting the hairpin sequence of Huang and Sinicrope
(26) into the pCMS5A plasmid, or Bcl-xL (shRNA #2) from
Jin-san Zhang (Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN). The targeted
sequences were as follows: Bcl-2 #1: 50 -TGGATGACTGAGTACCTGAAC-30 , Bcl-2 #2: 50 -ATGGCGCACGCTGGGAGAACG-30 ; Bcl-xL #1: 50 -CAGGGACAGCATATCAGAG-30 , Bcl-xL
#2: 50 -GTGGAACTCTATGGGAACAAT-30 ; Mcl-1 #1: 50 -CGGGACTGGCTAGTTAAAC-30 , Mcl-1 #2: 50 -GATTGTGACTCTCATTTCT-30 . Beginning 24 hours after transfection, cells
were treated with paclitaxel and/or navitoclax as indicated
and assayed for Annexin V binding by ﬂow microﬂuorimetry
as described above.

Pull-down assays
Using a 240-V pulse for 10 ms, log-phase Jurkat cells growing
in antibiotic-free medium were transiently transfected with
plasmids encoding full-length Bcl-2 (wild-type, S70A or S70E)
fused at its N-terminus with the S peptide tag (6, 23). After 24
hours, cells were washed and lysed in CHAPS buffer [1%
CHAPS, 1% glycerol, 150 mmol/L NaCl, 20 mmol/L HEPES
(pH 7.5) containing 1 mmol/L freshly added PMSF, 10 mg/mL
leupeptin, 10 mg/mL pepstatin, 100 mmol/L NaF, 10 mmol/L
sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mmol/L sodium vanadate, and 20
nmol/L microcystin] at 4 C for 30 minutes. Following clariﬁcation at 14,000 g, the supernatants were incubated with S
protein-agarose for 24 hours at 4 C. Beads were then washed
four times with isotonic wash buffer containing 1% (w/v)
CHAPS; bound proteins were solubilized in SDS sample buffer,
subjected to SDS-PAGE, and probed with the indicated antibodies. Bound antibodies were detected (27) using peroxidasecoupled secondary antibodies and enhanced chemiluminescence reagents (Thermo). The resulting X-ray images were
imported into Photoshop on an Epson 4490 scanner, converted
into PICT ﬁles without contrast adjustment, and assembled
into ﬁgures in Canvas X.
To assess the effects of paclitaxel and navitoclax, K562 cells
stably expressing S peptide–tagged Bcl-2 at levels equal to
endogenous Bcl-2 were generated as previously described
(28). Following treatment with 25 nmol/L paclitaxel and/or
1 mmol/L navitoclax for 18 hours, cells were washed with PBS,
and lysed in CHAPS buffer. After lysates were clariﬁed, aliquots
containing 600 mg protein (assayed by the bicinchoninic acid

method; ref. 29) were incubated with S protein-agarose for pulldowns as described in the preceding paragraph.
Statistical analysis
Graphs show summarized results from three independent
experiments. Differences between treatments were analyzed
by ANOVA using StatView5 (SAS). All P values stated in
ﬁgure legends have been subjected to a Bonferroni correction (30).

Results
Bcl-2 Ser70 phosphorylation enhances Bcl-2/Bak and
Bcl-2/Bim interactions
To assess the potential impact of Bcl-2 phosphorylation,
puriﬁed Bcl-2 was treated with CDK1/cyclin B1 complex and
assayed for binding to immobilized Bak using SPR, a wellestablished method for studying protein–protein interactions
(31, 32). MS demonstrated that Bcl-2 was phosphorylated on
Thr69, Ser70, Thr74, and Ser87 by CDK1. Under the conditions of
the reactions, very little unmodiﬁed Bcl-2 remained (Fig. 1A
and Supplementary Fig. S1). After CDK1/cyclin B-mediated
modiﬁcation, SPR indicated that Bcl-2 bound to Bak equally
rapidly but dissociated more slowly than unmodiﬁed Bcl-2
(Fig. 1B). Compared with an equilibrium dissociation constant
(KD) of approximately 150 nmol/L for unphosphorylated Bcl-2
binding to Bak, phosphorylated Bcl-2 bound about 5-fold more
tightly, although an accurate KD could not be determined
because the binding reﬂected multiple different phosphorylated species.

Figure 3. Bcl-2 S70A and S70E both diminish drug-induced apoptosis. Beginning 24 hours after Jurkat cells were transfected with 40 mg pSPN or S peptidetagged Bcl-2 [wild-type (wt), S70A, or S70E] together with 5 mg plasmid encoding EGFP-Histone H2B, cells were treated with the indicated concentrations
þ
of etoposide for 7 hours (A and B) or tipifarnib for 72 hours (C), then stained with APC-Annexin V. The percentage of EGFP cells that were stained
with Annexin V is indicated at the right of each dot plot in A and summarized in B. Error bars in B and C,  SD of three independent experiments. B, right, cell
lysates were subjected to SDS-PAGE and probed with the indicated antibodies to conﬁrm equal expression of Bcl-2 constructs.

added for the indicated length of time in the continued presence of paclitaxel. Whole cell lysates were then subjected to SDS-PAGE and probed with the
indicated antibodies. C, 24 hours after K562 cells stably expressing S peptide-tagged Bcl-2 were treated with diluent, 25 nmol/L paclitaxel, 1 mmol/L
navitoclax, or 25 nmol/L paclitaxel þ 1 mmol/L navitoclax, cell lysates prepared in 1% CHAPS buffer were incubated with S protein-agarose to recover Bcl-2
complexes. After SDS-PAGE and transfer to nitrocellulose, pull-downs (lanes 1–4) and one ﬁfth of the inputs (lanes 5–8) were probed with the
indicated antibodies. D, 24 hours after K562 cells were transiently transfected with empty vector, PCMS5A-Bcl-2 shRNA, PCMS5A-Bcl-xL shRNA, or
PCMS5A-Mcl-1 shRNA (all with EGFP-histone H2B expression), cells were treated with paclitaxel for another 48 hours, and stained with APC-Annexin V.

indices of cells transfected with the constructs described in D, incubated for 24 hours to allow protein knockdown, and treated with paclitaxel or diluent for an

Further analysis demonstrated that mutation of Ser70,
a known site for phosphorylation by multiple kinases
(33, 34), to the phosphomimetic amino acid glutamate
also enhanced the afﬁnity of puriﬁed Bcl-2 for Bak (Fig.
1C–F). Interestingly, mutation of Ser70 to alanine had a

www.aacrjournals.org

similar effect (Fig. 1E), as indicated by the slower dissociation of Bcl-2 S70E and S70A from Bak (Fig. 1F). These
results raised the possibility that the effect of modiﬁcation
at this site does not require the introduction of a negative
charge.

Bcl-2 Phosphorylation, Bak Binding, and Paclitaxel Resistance

In further studies, the effect of these mutations on binding to
Bim, an important activator of apoptosis (35–37), was likewise
examined. Wild-type Bcl-2 bound to Bim with a KD of 7 nmol/L,
whereas Bcl-2 S70E and Bcl-2 S70A bound with KD of 0.1 and 1
nmol/L, respectively (Fig. 1G–I), again demonstrating that
modiﬁed Bcl-2 has a higher afﬁnity for the proapoptotic protein.
Loop mutations alter Bcl-2 conformation
Because Thr69, Thr74, and Ser87 are also phosphorylated by
CDK1 in vitro (Supplementary Fig. S1), we examined the impact
of mutating these residues to alanine or glutamate as well. As
shown in Supplementary Fig. S2, each of these mutations also
enhanced the binding of Bcl-2 to Bak under cell-free conditions. These results suggested that modiﬁcation at any of the
four sites is sufﬁcient to affect binding and, because the altered
function does not require introduction of a negative charge,
that altered function might reﬂect a process that is independent of the generation of a phosphoepitope at a particular
amino acid. Further experiments focused on Ser70, the most
intensively studied but also the most controversial phosphorylation site (see Introduction).
Because Ser70 is located in an unstructured region of the Bcl2 protein, this portion of the protein has been deleted in
previous constructs used to determine the Bcl-2 three-dimensional structure (18, 38, 39). Accordingly, it is impossible to
assess the detailed effects of Ser70 mutations on Bcl-2 conformation. On the other hand, while purifying Bcl-2 S70A and
S70E, we observed increased proteolysis of these proteins in
bacterial lysates compared with wild-type Bcl-2 (Supplementary Fig. S3A). Moreover, when FPLC fractions containing fulllength Bcl-2 S70A and S70E were subjected to limited proteolysis with trypsin, a procedure that has previously been used
to assess changes in protein conformation (40), increased
protease susceptibility was again observed (Supplementary
Fig. S3B). MS indicated that the Bcl-2 fragment arising from
this in vitro proteolysis has been preferentially cleaved at Arg68
(Supplementary Fig. S3C), providing evidence that Bcl-2 "ﬂexible loop domain" is in a conformation that is relatively
inaccessible to interaction with other proteins (as exempliﬁed
by trypsin) in wild-type Bcl-2 protein and is rendered more
accessible by the S70E and S70A mutations.
Ser70 modiﬁcation increases Bak binding and survival in
intact cells
To determine whether the changes in binding detected
under cell-free condition would also be observed in intact cells,
plasmids encoding wild-type Bcl-2, Bcl-2 S70A, or Bcl-2 S70E
were transiently transfected into Jurkat T-ALL cells, a cell line
chosen because prior studies have demonstrated the consti-

tutive presence of Bcl-2/Bak complexes in these cells (6). The
three constructs were expressed equally (Fig. 2A, lanes 6–8),
ruling out a major change in protein stability. Consistent with
the results in Fig. 1, increased amounts of Bak and, to a smaller
extent, Bim, were detected bound to Bcl-2 S70A and S70E
compared with wild-type Bcl-2 (Fig. 2A, lanes 3 and 4 vs. 2).
To determine whether the increased afﬁnity of Bcl-2 S70E for
Bak and Bim resulted in increased cellular protection, Jurkat
cells were transfected with empty vector, wild-type Bcl-2, or
S70 mutants along with EGFP-Bak or EGFP-BimEL. As indicated in Fig. 2B and C, and Supplementary Fig. S4, transfection
with EGFP-Bak induced apoptosis in 55%  7% (mean  SD, 3
independent experiments) of cells cotransfected with empty
vector. This was decreased to 40%  3% of cells by cotransfection with wild-type Bcl-2 but decreased further to 24% 
3% by cotransfection with Bcl-2 S70E. Protection by Bcl-2
S70A was similar. Likewise, cotransfected Bcl-2 S70E and
S70A protected cells more effectively than wild-type Bcl-2
when cells were transfected with EGFP-BimEL (Fig. 2C and
Supplementary Fig. S4). Similar effects were also observed in
other cells as well, including mouse embryo ﬁbroblasts
(Supplementary Fig. S5).
In further experiments, the ability of wild-type Bcl-2 versus
Bcl-2 S70E to protect from drug-induced apoptosis was
examined. When Jurkat cells were treated with 50 mmol/L
etoposide, an agent previously shown to trigger apoptosis
through the mitochondrial pathway (41), transfection with
wild-type Bcl-2 diminished the apoptosis from 43%  5% to
33%  4% of transfected cells, whereas Bcl-2 S70A and S70E
at similar levels (inset, Fig. 3B) further decreased apoptosis
to 23%  1% and 21%  2% of transfected cells (Fig. 3B).
Likewise, induction of apoptosis by the farnesyltransferaseinhibitor tipifarnib, an agent previously shown to induce
apoptosis in lymphoid cells in a Bim- and Bak-dependent
manner (41), was decreased more by Bcl-2 S70A and S70E
than by wild-type Bcl-2 (Fig. 3C).
Implications of Bcl-2 phosphorylation for paclitaxel/
navitoclax synergy
To further assess the impact of Bcl-2 phosphorylation, we
examined conditions where Bcl-2 is phosphorylated in intact
cells. In particular, treatment of K562 cells with 25 nmol/L
paclitaxel, which induced mitotic arrest of more than 60% of
the cells (Fig. 4A, left panel), caused near-maximal phosphorylation of Bcl-2 in situ (Fig. 4A, right panel). This paclitaxelinduced Bcl-2 phosphorylation rapidly diminished (Fig. 4B,
lanes 5–8) after addition of the CDK inhibitor ﬂavopiridol (42),
suggesting that CDK1 plays a role in this modiﬁcation in situ.
After paclitaxel treatment, increased Bak was detected in Bcl-2

immunoprecipitates (Fig. 4C, lane 2 vs. lane 1). Interestingly,
total cellular BimEL diminished in this assay (Fig. 4C, lane 6),
but the amount pulled down with Bcl-2 in paclitaxel-treated
cells was unchanged (Fig. 4C, lane 2 vs. lane 1), suggesting an
increase in afﬁnity for Bim as well.
To assess the potential importance of this Bcl-2/Bim and
Bcl-2/Bak binding, we examined the effect of Bcl-2 downregulation on paclitaxel-induced cell cycle changes and
apoptosis. In these studies, Bcl-2 shRNA markedly enhanced
the sensitivity of K562 cells to paclitaxel-induced apoptosis
(Fig. 4D and Supplementary Figs. S6 and S7) without any
discernible effect on paclitaxel-induced mitotic arrest (Fig.
4E). This sensitizing effect of Bcl-2 knockdown was particularly noticeable at low paclitaxel concentrations (Fig. 4D
and Supplementary Fig. S7). Similar effects were observed
with Bcl-xL shRNA (Fig. 4D and Supplementary Figs. S6 and
S7), suggesting that Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL both inhibit apoptosis
during paclitaxel treatment. In contrast, Mcl-1 shRNA had a
much more limited effect on paclitaxel-induced apoptosis.
In further experiments, we examined the action of navitoclax, a BH3 mimetic that displaces proapoptotic Bcl-2 family
members from Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL (43), in the absence and
presence of paclitaxel. Paclitaxel by itself induced little apoptosis in K562 cells (Fig. 5A and B). In contrast, navitoclax
markedly enhanced paclitaxel-induced apoptosis (Fig. 5A and
B) that was Bim and Bax dependent (Fig. 5C). Similarly, in
A2780 ovarian cancer cells, treatment with paclitaxel induced
little apoptosis by itself, as did navitoclax, whereas the combination induced apoptosis in just under half of the cells (Fig.
5D and E), consistent with previous reports that ABT-737 or
navitoclax sensitizes cells to paclitaxel (18–22). Similar sensitization was also observed in Ovcar5 and Ovcar8 cells (Supplementary Fig. S8).
To assess whether this sensitization reﬂected effects of
navitoclax on Bcl-2 or Bcl-xL, cells were treated with paclitaxel
in the absence or presence of the Bcl-2-selective BH3 agonist
ABT-199 (44). As indicated in Figs. 5F and G, ABT-199
enhanced the cytotoxicity of paclitaxel, although the effects
were somewhat smaller (Supplementary Fig. S9; also see Fig.
5G vs. Fig. 5B and D). Accordingly, it seems that the navitoclaxinduced sensitization to paclitaxel reﬂects, at least in part,
antagonism of Bcl-2, although effects of Bcl-xL were also
evident.

Discussion
The present results demonstrate that phosphorylated Bcl-2
as well as Bcl-2 S70E and S70A exhibit increased afﬁnity for the
proapoptotic proteins Bak and Bim. Consistent with these
observations, increased sequestration of Bak and Bim is
observed in cells transfected with Bcl-2 S70E or S70A as well
as in cells where Bcl-2 becomes endogenously phosphorylated
during paclitaxel treatment. The importance of this enhanced
binding between phosphorylated Bcl-2 and its proapoptotic
binding partners is demonstrated not only by the increased
ability of Bcl-2 S70E to protect against various chemotherapeutic agents, but also by the marked increase in paclitaxel
sensitivity observed when Bcl-2 is downregulated by shRNA.

These results contribute new insight into regulation of Bcl-2
and simultaneously provide an explanation for the incompletely understood synergy between paclitaxel and BH3
mimetics.
Previous investigations have found that Bcl-2 S70E affords
increased protection from cytokine withdrawal-induced apoptosis compared with wild-type Bcl-2 (13, 14). The mechanism
of this effect has been unclear. We have extended these results
to drugs such as tipifarnib and etoposide (Figs. 3B and C). Our
demonstration that Bcl-2 S70E, like phosphorylated Bcl-2,
exhibits enhanced binding to Bak and Bim (Fig. 1) provides
a mechanistic explanation for increased protection by Bcl-2
S70E relative to wild-type Bcl-2.
Previous studies also demonstrated that Bcl-2 is phosphorylated during mitosis (8–11). The molecular consequences of
this phosphorylation were not completely understood. Instead,
recent investigations focused on the role of Mcl-1 as a critical
regulator of apoptosis during mitosis (45). In particular, degradation of Mcl-1 by the E3 ligase FBWX7 was reported to be
critical for paclitaxel-induced apoptosis. On the other hand,
our results in K562 cells showed that Mcl-1 downregulation has
a limited effect on paclitaxel sensitivity (Fig. 4D and Supplementary Fig. S7). In contrast, Bcl-2 downregulation rendered
K562 cells much more sensitive to paclitaxel-induced apoptosis, particularly at low drug concentrations (Fig. 4D and
Supplementary Fig. S7). Further analysis demonstrated that
Bcl-2 from paclitaxel-treated cells pulls down proportionately
more Bak and Bim than Bcl-2 from interphase cells (Fig. 4C).
The increased afﬁnity of phosphorylated Bcl-2 for Bak and Bim
in vitro (Fig. 1) provides a potential explanation for these
observations.
In early descriptions of ABT-737 and navitoclax, impressive
synergy between these Bcl-2/Bcl-xL antagonists and paclitaxel
was reported (18, 43). We have likewise observed that navitoclax or ABT-199 increased paclitaxel-induced apoptosis in a
variety of cell lines (Fig. 5 and Supplementary Fig. S8). Furthermore, we have demonstrated that the killing by the paclitaxel/navitoclax combination is markedly diminished by Bim
knockdown (Fig. 5C). This synergy is not easily explained if
Mcl-1 is the principal regulator of survival during mitosis but is
readily explained if the mitotic phosphorylation of Bcl-2 renders this protein a particularly effective neutralizer of Bim and
Bak during mitosis.
Previous studies have shown that Bcl-2 S70A, containing an
alanine in place of Ser70, also protects cell from apoptosis (12).
On the basis of these observations, along with the assumption
that phosphorylation of Ser70 and replacement with alanine
would have the opposite functional consequences, it was
concluded that phosphorylation at Ser70 inactivates Bcl-2
(12). Accordingly, whether Ser70 phosphorylation enhances or
diminishes Bcl-2 function has been controversial. Importantly,
the effects of these modiﬁcations have not previously been
addressed using puriﬁed Bcl-2 under cell-free conditions. The
present study shows that Bcl-2 loop phosphorylation, replacement of Ser70 by glutamate, and replacement of Ser70 by alanine
all increase the afﬁnity of Bcl-2 for Bak and Bim under cell-free
conditions (Fig. 1) as well as the ability of Bcl-2 to sequester
these proteins in intact cells (Figs. 2 and 4C).

Bcl-2 Phosphorylation, Bak Binding, and Paclitaxel Resistance

If one assumes that phosphorylation alters Bcl-2 function by
altering the charge on Ser70, for example, by creating or
destroying a site used for interaction with a binding partner,
then the similar effects of alanine and glutamate substitutions
are difﬁcult to reconcile. On the other hand, if Ser70 is hydrogen
bonded to another residue in Bcl-2, then any alteration that
disrupts this hydrogen bond, including phosphorylation or
replacement of the serine, might exhibit the same effect.
Consistent with this latter model, we observed that S70E and
S70A mutations not only had similar effects on the afﬁnity of
Bcl-2 for binding partners (Figs. 1 and 2), but also altered the
conformation of the Bcl-2 ﬂexible loop domain in a similar
fashion, as indicated by protease accessibility at Arg68 (Supplementary Fig. S3). Although the Thr69, Thr74, and Ser87
phosphorylation sites (Supplementary Fig. S1) were not studied in as much detail, both glutamate and alanine substitutions
at these sites also enhanced afﬁnity for Bak (Supplementary
Fig. S2), the only binding partner examined. Once again the
similar effects of alanine and glutamate substitutions are
difﬁcult to reconcile with a model that requires phosphorylation of a speciﬁc amino acid but are readily explained if these
substitutions are affecting conformation of the Bcl-2 loop
domain. Because this ﬂexible loop domain has been deleted
from all Bcl-2 constructs previously examined by nuclear
magnetic resonance and X-ray crystallography, further structural studies are required to conﬁrm the model described
above and elucidate at the molecular level how these various
modiﬁcations produce the same functional consequences.
In summary, results of the present study provide the ﬁrst
mechanistic explanation for the enhanced antiapoptotic
effects of phosphorylated Bcl-2, demonstrate that endogenous
Bcl-2 exhibits higher afﬁnity for Bak and Bim when phosphor-

ylated during mitosis, and provide new insight into the previously observed synergy between BH3 mimetics and paclitaxel. Interestingly, Bcl-xL is also phosphorylated by CDK1 during
mitosis (46). Moreover, the Bcl-xL S62A mutant protects cells
better than wild-type Bcl-xL against cyclin B-induced toxicity
(46). Whether this phosphorylation reﬂects a similar mechanism for regulating Bcl-xL function during mitosis remains to
be determined.
