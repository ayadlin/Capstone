ABSTRACT:
Celecoxib, a COX-2 inhibitor and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug, can
prevent several types of cancer, including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Here we
show that celecoxib suppressed the self-renewal and drug-pumping functions in HCC
cells. Besides, celecoxib depleted CD44+/CD133+ hepatic cancer stem cells (hCSC).
Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and CD133 overexpression did not reverse the celecoxibinduced depletion of hCSC. Also, celecoxib inhibited progression of rat Novikoff
hepatoma. Moreover, a 60-day celecoxib program increased the survival rate of rats
with hepatoma. Histological analysis revealed that celecoxib therapy reduced the
abundance of CD44+/CD133+ hCSCs in hepatoma tissues. Besides, the hCSCs depletion
was associated with elevated apoptosis and blunted proliferation and angiogenesis
in hepatoma. Celecoxib therapy activated peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor
γ (PPARγ) and up-regulated PTEN, thereby inhibiting Akt and disrupting hCSC
expansion. PTEN gene delivery by adenovirus reduced CD44/CD133 expression in
vitro and hepatoma formation in vivo. This study suggests that celecoxib suppresses
cancer stemness and progression of HCC via activation of PPARγ/PTEN signaling.

INTRODUCTION

demonstrated in animal models of diethylnitrosamineinduced HCC [18] and Huh7 xenograft hepatoma
[19]. Both COX-2-dependent and COX-2-independent
pathways contribute to celecoxib-mediated HCC
chemoprevention [20]. However, the therapeutic efficacy
of celecoxib for HCC has not been tested in immunecompetent animals with orthotopic hepatoma. Thus,
this study investigated the therapeutic potential and
mechanism of celecoxib in rat Novikoff hepatoma induced
by US-guided implantation [21].

Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) accounts
for 70–85% of liver cancers and is one of the most
common malignancies worldwide [1]. Current HCC
therapies include surgery, liver transplantation,
chemotherapy, transarterial chemoembolization (TAE),
and radiofrequency ablation [2]. However, the overall
prognosis for HCC remains poor. Sorafenib, an inhibitor
of multiple kinases, including vascular endothelial growth
factor receptor (VEGFR), platelet-derived growth factor
receptor (PDGFR), and Raf kinases, is currently the only
target therapy for HCC [3, 4]. However, the high cost and
limited pro-survival effect of sorafenib warrant further
development of therapeutic alternatives for HCC.
Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) is an inducible
enzyme frequently found in inflammatory tissues and is
involved in carcinogenesis pathways in many organs. It
has been reported that COX-2 expression is correlated
with angiogenesis, invasion, relapse, chemoresistance,
and tumorigenesis in HCC [5]. Besides, a significant
correlation between COX-2 expression and active
inflammation in the adjacent non-cancerous liver is
associated with shorter disease-free survival in HCC
patients [6]. COX-2 promotes hepatoma cells growth
and inhibits cell apoptosis through Akt activation [7, 8].
Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), the major product of COX-2,
stimulates the proliferation, migration, and invasion in
hepatoma cells by activating β-catenin and Akt signaling
[9].
Cancer stem cells (CSCs), the rare and most
malignant subpopulations in tumors, are maintained
by indefinitely self-renew abilities and resistant to drug
therapy [10, 11]. CD133 is a universal marker of stem cells
and CSCs and CD133+ hepatic cancer stem cells (hCSCs)
tumor cells have been identified to exhibit properties of
CSCs in human HCC and mouse liver cancer [12-14].
Indeed, CD133+ hCSCs cells have higher expression
and increased activity of aldehyde dehydrogenase
(ALDH) to promote their tumorigenicity [13]. Moreover,
a recent study has indicated that high expression levels
of hCSCs biomarkers, including CD133 and CD44, are
correlated with tumor angiogenesis and poor prognosis of
HCC patients [15]. Though not fully elucidated, several
signaling pathways, including Akt and Wnt/β-catenin,
have been implicated in the CSCs maintenance [11].
Besides, inhibition of Akt signaling leads to decreased
CD133 and CD44 expression in HCC cells [16, 17].
Celecoxib, a selective COX-2 inhibitor and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), is widely
used for pain and inflammation. Celecoxib attenuates
Akt phosphorylation and induces growth inhibition
and apoptosis in HCC cells, which can be partially
reversed by ectopic COX-2 expression and PGE2 [8].
The chemopreventive effect of celecoxib has been

RESULTS
PGE2 from non-tumor tissues induces differential
distribution of liver cancer stem cells in Novikoff
hepatoma
Poorly differentiated HCCs expressed less COX2 than surrounding hepatocytes of non-tumor region
[22], and COX-2 expression in non-tumor tissue play a
positive role in relapse of HCC after surgery [6]. We first
examined COX-2 expression and the spatial distribution
of CD44+/CD133+ hCSCs in Novikoff hepatoma using
immunohistochemical and immunofluorescent analyses,
respectively. COX-2 immunostaining was primarily
localized in non-tumor hepatic tissues, but was only
minimally detected in Novikoff hepatoma. Moreover,
CD44+/CD133+ hCSC abundance was increased in
regions near COX-2-expressing non-tumor tissues
compared with regions that were farther away (Fig. 1A).
Based on the lack of COX-2 expression in hepatoma, it
was hypothesized that PGE2 originated from the COX-2expressing liver and promoted the generation of cancer
stem cells in Novikoff hepatoma. To test this hypothesis,
comparative analysis of COX-2 expression between N1S1 rat hepatoma cells and Clone-9 rat liver cells showed
that COX-2 mRNA and protein levels were significantly
higher in Clone-9 cells than in N1-S1 cells (Fig. 1B).
Additionally, COX-2-expressing Clone-9 cells secreted
significantly higher amounts of PGE2, whose production
was significantly inhibited by treatment with celecoxib
(Fig. 1C). PGE2 secretion was not detectable in N1S1. We then investigated whether conditioned medium
(CM) from Clone-9 cells, which contained a high PGE2
content, influenced the generation of hCSCs in N1-S1
cells. Flow cytometry analysis showed that co-culture
with CM from Clone-9 cells significantly enhanced the
abundance of CD44+/CD133+ hCSCs in N1-S1 cells
(Fig. 1D). This stimulatory effect was diminished in
CM from celecoxib-treated Clone-9 cells, indicating
that PGE2 has a stimulatory function in hCSC genesis.
Moreover, immunoblot analysis showed that incubation
with CM from Clone-9 cells elevated expression of CD44

of cancer stem-like cells in HCC cells

and CD133 in N1-S1 cells (Fig. 1E), whereas CM from
celecoxib-treated clone-9 cells upregulated CD44 and
CD133 to a lesser extent. These results suggest that PGE2
from hepatic tissues induces differential hCSC distribution
in Novikoff hepatoma.

We first evaluated the anti-neoplastic efficacy of
celecoxib in vitro by cell proliferation assay and colony
formation assay, respectively. Despite moderate inhibition
on cell proliferation (Supplementary Fig. 1A and B),

medium was incubated for 48 h to prepare control medium for N1-S1 co-culture. After N1-S1 cells were cultured in celecoxib-treated

celecoxib inhibited the oncogenic behaviors, including
invasiveness (data not shown) and anchorage-independent
growth (Supplementary Fig. 1C and D), in human Hep3B
and Huh7 cells respectively with a half-maximal inhibitory
concentrations (IC50) of 31.32 and 29.33 µM. We
subsequently investigated the influence of celecoxib on
hCSCs functions in HCC cells in the absence or presence
of PGE2. By using sphere formation assay to evaluate the
self-renewal capability of hCSCs [23], it was found that
celecoxib potently inhibited the basal or PGE2-stimulated
sphere formation in human (Huh-7) and rat (N1-S1) HCC

cells (Fig. 2A). To study the drug efflux functions of
hCSCs using side population (SP) analysis [24], it was
observed celecoxib also attenuated the endogenous and
PGE2-induced drug-pumping capability in N1-S1 cells
(Fig. 2B). Together, these results indicated that celecoxib
perturbs the hCSCs functions in HCC cells.
We then evaluated whether celecoxib affected the
abundance of CD44+/CD133+ hCSCs in hepatoma cells.
PGE2 is a potent stem cells regulator, and it can promote
stem cells function [25]. We also found that exogenous
PGE2 induced up-regulation of CD44 and CD133 hCSCs

marker in human Hep3B and Huh7 cells (Supplementary
Fig. 2). Flow cytometry analysis showed that celecoxib
significantly attenuated the PGE2-induced CD44+/CD133+
hCSCs in N1-S1 cells (Fig. 2C). Besides, celecoxib
treatment significantly decreased the CD133 and CD44
protein levels in PGE2-stimulated N1-S1 cells (Fig .2D).
To test whether CD133 overexpression could revert
the celecoxib-induced hCSCs depletion, we generated
CD133-overexpressing N1-S1 cells using retrovirus gene
delivery (Fig. 2E). These CD133-overexpressing N1S1 cells exhibited elevated expression of CSC markers,
including Sox2 and β-catenin, and enhanced self-renewal
ability. Nevertheless, celecoxib supply still significantly
abrogated the spheres formation of CD133-expressing N1-

S1 cells at low concentration (5 µM; Fig. 2F). Moreover,
combination of CD133 overexpression with excessive
PGE2 failed to rescue the celecoxib-induced suppression
of sphere formation in N1-S1 cells. Together, these results
indicate that celecoxib is an effective blocker of cancer
stem-like cells in HCC cells.

Celecoxib therapy perturbs the tumor progression

the chemopreventive effect of celecoxib for Novikoff

hepatoma in rats and found that a 17-day prophylactic
celecoxib program significantly reduced the size and
weight of Novikoff hepatoma compared with drinking
water-treated control (Supplementary Fig. 3A-C).
Subsequently, we investigated the therapeutic efficacy
of a 7-day celecoxib regimen for established Novikoff
hepatoma in rats by serial non-invasive CT and US
analysis (Fig. 3A-C). Both CT and US imaging analysis
revealed that celecoxib therapy perturbed hepatoma
progression. Quantification analysis of US-measured
hepatoma diameters showed that mean tumor size in
celecoxib-treated group was not significantly increased
(from 11.07 ± 4.30 mm on day 10 to 14.98 ± 10.16 mm
on day 18; n = 13) whereas mean tumor size in control
group was significantly increased within the same period
(from 11.31 ± 8.03 to 26.55 16.02 mm; p < 0.01, n =
13). Moreover, the size of celecoxib-treated hepatoma was
significantly smaller than that in control group (p < 0.05;

Fig. 3C).
According to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid
Tumours (RECIST) ver.1.1 [26], patients with an increase
of 20% or more in lesion size or those with new lesions
were regarded as having progressive disease (PD). Patients
with a change of lesion size ranging from an increase of
<20% to a decrease of <30% and with no new lesion
were stratified as having stable disease (SD). Patients
with a 30% or greater decrease in the target lesion were
regarded as achieving partial response (PR). Patients with
disappearance of the lesion were stratified as achieving
complete response (CR). RECIST analysis showed
that 84.62% (11/13) animals showed PD, and 15.38%
(2/13) animals showed SD in control group (Fig. 3D). In
celecoxib-treated group, 53.85% (7/13) animals showed
PD, 23.08% (3/13) animals showed SD, 15.38% (2/13)
animals showed PR, and 7.69% (1/13) animals showed
CR. Quantification studies of dissected hepatoma tissues

also confirmed that the weight and size of hepatoma were
significantly reduced in rats receiving celecoxib therapy (p
< 0.05 and p < 0.01; Fig. 3E).
By using Kaplan-Meier analysis, the survival
study indicated a 60-day celecoxib therapy significantly
increased the survival rate in rats bearing established
hepatoma (88.99% in celecoxib group versus 44.44% in
control; p < 0.05; Fig. 3F). These findings supported the
therapeutic potential of celecoxib in rats with pre-existing
hepatoma.

analysis showed that the immunostaining of CD133 and
CD44 was significantly reduced in celecoxib-treated
hepatoma compared with that in control (Fig. 4B). This
was consistent with the results of immunoblot analysis,
which showed a significantly decreased CD133 and
CD44 protein levels in celecoxib-treated hepatoma tissues
(Fig. 4C). Interestingly, prophylactic celecoxib regimen
also suppressed the expression of CD133 and CD44 in
tumor tissues (Supplementary Fig. 3D and E). Therefore,
celecoxib therapy attenuated the expression of hCSC
markers, thereby depleting the hCSC genesis in Novikoff
hepatoma.

than perturbing cancer stemness. By immunostaining
of Ki-67, an index of cell proliferation, it was observed
that celecoxib therapy significantly decreased the Ki-67positive proliferating cells in hepatoma tissues (Fig. 4D).
This was accompanied with an increment in TUNELpositive apoptotic cells (Fig. 4E). Since angiogenesis
is critical to the viability of cancer cells, we evaluated
the influence of celecoxib on neovascularization in
hepatoma tissues. It was noted that the CD31-positive,
neovascularized vessels were significantly reduced
in celecoxi-treated Novikoff hepatoma (Fig. 4F). A
recent study has indicated that CD133+ CSCs may give

rise to tumor endothelium, thereby contributing to
tumor vasculature and angiogenesis [27]. Interestingly,
immunofluorescence staining unveiled that the CD133+/
CD31+ vessels were significantly diminished in celecoxibtreated hepatoma (Fig. 4G).

Celecoxib induces PPARγ/PTEN activation to
disrupt Akt signaling and cancer stemness in
hepatoma cells.
Because Akt signaling is activated in CD133+
human HCC cells [16], we studied whether Akt pathway

was involved in celecoxib-induced suppression of hepatic
cancer stemness. Moreover, celecoxib has been reported
to stimulate PPARγ as well as PTEN, the endogenous
antagonist of Akt signaling, in hepatoma cells [20], we
investigated whether this signaling pathway affects
the therapeutic mechanism of celecoxib for Novikoff
hepatoma. Immunoblot analysis revealed that expression
of PPARγ and PTEN was significantly upregulated as well
as Akt was dephoshorylated in celecoxib-treated hepatoma
tissues (Fig. 5A). Likewise, immunofluorescence
analysis revealed the prominent increase in PPARγ
and PTEN expression in celecoxib-treated N1-S1 cells
(Fig. 5B). Immunoblot analysis further showed that
celecoxib-elicited PPARγ/PTEN upregulation and Akt
dephosphorylation were dose-dependent (Fig. 5C).
Pharmaceutical modulators of PPARγ signaling
were used to confirm the role of PPARγ in celecoxibinduced PTEN upregulation in hepatoma cells. Treatment

with rosiglitazone, a PPARγ agonist, increased the
endogenous and celecoxib-induced PTEN protein levels
in hepatoma cells (Fig.5D). In contrast, adding GW9662,
a PPARγ antagonist, attenuated celecoxib-induced PTEN
upregulation without affecting the basal PTEN levels (Fig.
5E).
To validate whether PTEN upregulation indeed
contributed to the inhibition of hepatic cancer stemness
and hepatoma growth, we employed adenovirus gene
delivery to achieve PTEN overexpression in hepatoma
cells. It was found that PTEN-overexpressing N1-S1 cells
not only showed attenuated Akt phosphorylation, but
also diminished CD133 and CD44 expression (Fig. 6A).
In animal study, Ad-PTEN-infected N1-S1 cells did not
led to hepatoma formation in rats (0/8), which whereas
was lower than tumor incidence in Ad-GFP (6/8) and
control (6/8) groups (Fig. 6B). Moreover, we also found
that Ad-PTEN gene delivery suppressed PGE2-promoted

sphere formation in human Huh-7 cells (Fig. 6C). In
immunoblot analysis, PTEN overexpression also reversed
PGE2-induced Akt activation and hCSCs marker upregulation in Huh7 cells (Fig. 6D). Because mammalian
target of rapamycin (mTOR) is downstream effector
of Akt, we utilized rapamycin, a mTOR inhibitor, and
found rapamycin also suppressed PGE2-stimulated sphere
formation in hepatoma cells (Fig. 6E). To validate the
role of PTEN in celecoxib-mediated stemness inhibition,
PTEN knockdown was performed using PTEN siRNA,
which significantly increased the expression of CD133
and CD44 (Fig. 7A), and enhanced the cancer stemness
in hepatoma cells in HCC cells (Fig. 7B). Besides, PTEN
silencing significantly attenuated the anti-stemness effect
of celecoxib in N1-S1 cells (from 90.50% inhibition
to 80.82% inhibition; p < 0.05) and Huh7 cells (from
82.84% inhibition to 51.41% inhibition; p < 0.01) cells.
These results indicate PPARγ/PTEN/Akt signaling plays
a crucial role in celecoxib-induced suppression of cancer
stemness and hepatoma progression.

colon cancer [31, 32], breast cancer [33] and leukemia
[34]. COX-2 can promotes HCC cell growth through Akt
activation [8], but the role of COX-2/PGE2 signaling in
hepatic cancer stemness has not yet been reported. In this
study, exogenous or non-tumor derived PGE2 promoted
tumor sphere formation and increment of SPCs and
CD44+/CD133+ hCSCs in HCC cells. It has been reported
that PGE2 can promote Akt signaling [9], and Akt signaling
also involved in CD133+ hCSCs regulaton [16]. From
upon evidences, non-tumor COX-2 can be as a target for
cancer therapy and prevention in advanced HCC.
Recently, lupeol, a triterpene from fruits and
vegetables, inhibited the self-renewal ability of liver
tumor-initiating cells (TICs) present in both HCC cell lines
and clinical HCC samples. Besides, PTEN upregulation
participates in lupeol-induced inhibition of CD133
expression, self-renewal and chemoresistance in hepatoma
cells [23]. It also been reported that NSAIDs suppress
cancer stem cells via inhibiting COX-2 and activating
PPARγ in colon cancer [35]. Celecoxib also up-regulates
PPARγ and PTEN, and PTEN is a negative regulator of
Akt activity. It has been reported that celecoxib increases
PPARγ expression and PTEN activity in wild-type and
COX-2-deleted Huh7 cells [20]. Besides, two putative
PPARγ binding sites within the PTEN promoter are
present approximately 15 and 13 kb upstream of the ATG
site [36]. In our study, rosiglitazone enhanced celecoxibinduced up-regulation of PTEN in N1-S1 cells, and
GW9662 attenuated celecoxib-induced up-regulation
of PTEN. This indicates that celecoxib can up-regulate
PTEN mediated activation and up-regulation of PPARγ
in hepatoma cells. Liver specific PTEN deletion promotes
CD133+ hCSCs in mice [37], and knockdown of PTEN
can up-regulate CD133 expression in hepatoma cells
[23]. We also found Ad-PTEN gene delivery suppressed
hCSCs marker expression and tumor initiating, and PTEN
knockdown up-regulated CD133 and CD44 in hepatoma
cells. In human Huh-7 cells, Ad-PTEN gene delivery
suppressed PGE2-induced Akt activation, CD133/CD44
up-regulation and tumor sphere formation. PTEN siRNA
transfection partially prevented the effect of celecoxib on
sphere formation in N1-S1 and Huh7 cells. This indicates
celecoxib-induced PTEN up-regulation is partially
involved in the suppression of hepatic cancer stemness.
PTEN is not only upstream regulator of Akt, recent
studies indicated other molecular such as Aurora A also
regulate Akt pathway [38]. mTOR (a  downstream effector
of Akt) is also highly activated in aggressive HCC, and
mTOR activation plays an important role in hepatoma cell
growth and development [39]. We also found rapamycin
(mTOR inhibitor) suppressed tumor sphere in Huh7 cells.
Moreover, PTEN/Akt signaling is also involved in CD44+/
CD133+ CSCs in other solid tumors, not only in liver
cancer [40]. Rapamycin also suppressed sphere formation
in other cancer [41].
In chemoprevention studies, a 17-day celecoxib

DISCUSSION
The present study demonstrates for the first time
that celecoxib is a potent inhibitor of cancer stemness
in HCC in vitro and in vivo. This is consistent with
a recent study that celecoxib inhibits tumor sphere
through CD133 downregulation in colon cancer [28].
Importantly, the anti-CSCs function of celecoxib could
not be reversed by exogenous PGE2 supply, implicating
COX-2/PGE2-independent pathway might be involved
in celecoxib-induced stemness suppression. This is
in accordance with previous studies showing COX2-dependent and COX-2-independent mechanism in
celecoxib-mediated inhibition of HCC growth [19, 20].
However, celecoxib alone inhibited the stemness-related
function without affecting the CD44+/CD133+ hCSCs,
implicating additional hCSC population were regulated
by celecoxib. We next validated whether PGE2-promoted
and celecoxib-inhibited self-renewal were through the
regulation of hCSCs surface markers in N1-S1 cells.
CD133 over-expression significantly promoted the sphere
formation, but the stimulatory effect of PGE2 on sphere
formation could not be observed in CD133-overexpressing
hepatoma cells, suggesting that CD133 up-regulation
participated in PGE2-induced cancer stemness. However,
CD133 overexpression failed to rescue celecoxib-induced
suppression of sphere formation, implicating CD133 is
might be a relatively downstream effector in celecoxibinduced stemness inhibition. Together, CD133 downregulation contributed to celecoxib-induced suppression
of PGE2-stimulated cancer stemness.
COX-2/PGE2 signaling regulates liver regeneration
[29] and stem cells [25], and signal regulation and the
pathway are similar for normal and cancer stem cells [30].

treatment potently suppressed tumor burden and tumor
weight in rats with Novikoff hepatoma. This is consistent
with a previous study showing that diethylnitrosamine
induced HCC [18]. Additionally, a preventive celecoxib
regimen inhibits CD44 and CD133 expression.
Therapeutic celecoxib can retard tumor growth and
inhibit CD44+/CD133+ hCSCs. Moreover, CD133+ CSCs
reportedly differentiate into endothelial cells in tumors
[27]. We also found that celecoxib therapy decreased
CD31+/CD133+ blood vessels in tumor tissues, indicating
the trans-differentiation potential of hCSCs. Suppression
of hCSCs may be involved in the inhibition of cell
proliferation and angiogenesis, as well as induction of cell
apoptosis in vivo following celecoxib therapy. hCSCs and
tumor microenvironments interaction is very important in
HCC progression [42], and cancer stemness also promotes
immunosppressive cells infiltration (tumor-associated
macrophages and regulatory T cells) [43, 44]. Immunecompetent orthotopic HCC model can provide a truest
stemness niches and tumor microenvironments, and it is
an advantage in stem cells biology and tumor immunology
studies. In this study, the dose and duration of celecoxib
therapy required to suppress cancer stemness is clinically
feasible because the pharmacokinetic of celecoxib
indicates that the serum celecoxib levels can reach up to
10 μM in rats after feeding at 30 mg/kg [45]. Moreover,
it has been recently reported that a 3-day treatment was
sufficient to downregulate CD133 expression in patients
with colon cancer [46]. This again supports that the
dosage of celecoxib used in our study is in the range of
physiological concentration, and celecoxib treatment
for 7 days is sufficient for suppressing an increase in
hCSCs during the short-term therapy. Given the lack of
hepatotoxicity and bone marrow suppression, celecoxib
therapy may constitute an adjuvant therapy for current
HCC therapeutic modalities. Although celecoxib therapy
fails to eradicate established HCC, further investigation
examining the potential of celecoxib as adjuvant therapy
for current HCC therapies such as surgery, TAE, target
therapy or chemotherapy is expected, particularly because
celecoxib is well tolerated in humans and shows an
excellent safety record and limited hepatic toxicity [47].
MK-2206 (a Akt inhibitor) has been reported that it can
synergize with convention chemotherapy in HCC [48].
Celecoxib inhibited Akt activation in this study, celecoxib
and chemotherapeutic drug combined therapy is maybe
a potential treatment for HCC in future. Liver fibrosis/
cirrhosis is often observed in HCC patients, celecoxib also
shows antifibrogenic effects in rats [49, 50], implicating
celecoxib should be considered to treat HCC or other liver
diseases in future.
We herewith proposed a model for celecoxibmediated inhibition of hCSC expansion in Novikoff
hepatoma (Fig. 7C). In the extrinsic pathway, celecoxib
reduces PGE2 production by inhibiting the activities of
COX-2 in inflammatory non-tumor tissues. In the intrinsic
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

pathways, celecoxib activates the PPARγ/PTEN pathway,
leading to perturbation of the PGE2-stimulated Akt
signaling. Because of such a dual function of celecoxib
in modulating cancer stemness, the therapeutic efficacy
of celecoxib for rat Novikoff hepatoma. Because of its
similar potency in repressing cancer stemness in human
HCC, our study advocates that celecoxib may be constitute
an alternative therapeutic agent in human HCC.
In conclusion, we found that celecoxib therapy
inhibits hCSCs expansion through both extrinsic and
intrinsic pathways; we identified a novel pathway for Aktsignaling regulation by PPARγ/PTEN, which involved, in
part, the intrinsic pathway regulating hCSCs. This is the
first study to evaluate the therapeutic efficacy and survival
analysis of celecoxib in orthotopic HCC. Celecoxib shows
a high potential for use in a monotherapy or adjuvant
therapy for treating HCC. Because limited therapeutic
options are available for treating HCC, celecoxib or
COX-2 inhibitors may present a promising alternative
for treating HCC. Future clinical studies are necessary to
validate the therapeutic potential of celecoxib for HCC
and other aggressive cancers.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell culture and drugs
N1-S1 (rat HCC), Clone-9 (rat hepatocyte), Hep3B
(human HCC) and Huh7 (human HCC) cells were from
American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) where they
were characterized by mycoplasma detection, DNA
Fingerprinting, isozyme detection and cell vitality
detection. All cell lines were immediately expanded
and frozen such that they could be restarted every 2 to
3 months from a frozen vial of the same batch of cells.
N1-S1 cells were maintained in RPMI-1640 medium
(Gibco, Bethesda, MD) containing 10% calf serum
(Hyclone). Clone-9 cells were maintained in F12K
medium (Gibco, Bethesda, MD) containing 10% fetal
bovine serum (Hyclone). Hep3B and Huh7 cells were
maintained in DMEM medium (Gibco, Bethesda, MD)
containing 10% calf serum. All the media for cell culture
were supplemented with 2 mM l-glutamine (Hyclone),
100 mg/mL streptomycin (Hyclone), and 100 U/mL
penicillin (Hyclone). All cells were maintained under
humidified conditions in 95% air and 5% CO2 at 37°C.
Celecoxib powder was from Pharmacia Corp (St. Louis,
MO). Celecoxib capsules (200 mg tablets; Celebrex)
were purchased from Pfizer (La Jolla, CA). GW9662,
rosiglitazone, verapamil, and rapamycin were purchased
from Sigma (St. Louis, MO). PGE2 was purchased from
Merck (Darmstadt, Germany).

with N2 supplement (Gibco), EGF (20 ng/mL;
PeproTech), and bFGF (20 ng/mL; PeproTech). To study
the effect of celecoxib or rapamycin on PGE2-promoted
sphere formation, cells were pretreated with PGE2 (1 μM)
in serum-free medium for 48h after serum starvation for
24 h. After PGE2 pretreatment, cells (5000 cells per well)
were seeded into an ultralow-attachment 6-well plate
(Corning Life Sciences, Lowell, MA) with or without
celecoxib (10 μM) or rapamycin (100 nM) treatment. After
7 to 10 days, the number of tumor spheres was evaluated
using light microscopy (Leica Microsystems). When cells
were infected with adenovirus (Ad-GFP or Ad-PTEN),
PGE2 (1 μM) was added at 12 h post infection, and cells
were treated in serum-free medium for 48 h before sphere
culture. When cells were transfected with siRNA, cells
were seeded into an ultralow-attachment 6-well plate with
or without celecoxib (10 μM) at 12 h post transfection.

To access the growth rates, cells (5×103/well) were
seeded in 96-well plates, and then cells were incubated
overnight in 95% air and 5% CO2 at 37oC before drug
treatment. After drug treatment for 48 hours, Alarmar
Blue reagent (10:1) (Invitrogen) was added and cells
were incubated at 37°C for 2 hours. Absorbance was
measured with an ELISA reader (Dynex Technologies,
Inc., Chantilly, VA) at 570-600 nm. Cell viability was
expressed as a percentage of absorbance in treated wells
relative to that of untreated (control) wells.

Colony formation assay
Hep3B and Huh7 cells (3000 cells per well) were
treated with celecoxib for 10 days, and cells were stained
with crystal violet and aggregates of more than 50 cells
were scored as colonies.

Side population cells (SPCs) analysis
After treatment with celecoxib (10 μM) or PGE2 (1
μM) in serum-free medium for 48 hours, cells (1 × 106
cells/mL) were incubated in DMEM/5% FBS containing
fresh Hoechst 33342 (final concentration 5 μg/mL;
Sigma-Aldrich) for 90 min at 37 °C. In some cases, cells
were incubated with the Hoechst dye in the presence of
verapamil (50 μM; Sigma-Aldrich) for reliable gating of
SPCs. After indicated treatment, cells were centrifuged
and resuspended in PBS containing propidium iodide (1
μg/mL; Sigma-Aldrich) for 5 min before flow cytometric
analysis (Becton Dickinson). The Hoechst dye was excited
with the UV laser at 351–364 nm, and fluorescence was
measured using a 515-nm side population filter (Hoechst
blue) and a 608 EFLP optical filter (Hoechst red). A 540
DSP filter was used to separate the emission wavelengths.
Data were collected and analyzed using the CellQuest
software (Becton Dickinson).

Real-time quantitative RT-PCR
Total RNA was extracted from cultured cells using
Trizol (Tel-Test Inc., Friendswoods, TX). Two micrograms
of total RNA was used for the reverse transcription
reaction with Superscriptase II (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA)
using oligo-dT and random primers. One twentieth of
complementary DNA generated was used as template for
real time PCR analysis. Amplification and detection were
done by a LightCycler DNA Master SYBR Green I kit
(Roche, Manheim, Germany) in a LightCycler Detection
System (Roche, Manheim, Germany). The PCR reaction
was carried out as follows: one cycle of 95 °C for 10 min,
45 cycles of 95°C for 15 s, 60 °C for 5 s, and 72 °C for 20
s. After amplification, a final melting curve protocol was
performed to determine the specificity of the PCR reaction.
The primer sequences were as follows: β-actin, (forward
primer: 5′-TCCTGTGGCATCCACGAAACT-3′; reverse
primer: 5′-GAAGCATTTGCGGTGGACGAT-3′); COX-2,
(forward primer: 5′-GGTGTATCCCCCCACAGTCA-3′;
reverse primer: 5′-CCAGG CACCAGACCAAAGAC-3′).

Retrovirus production and infection
Retrovirus vectors encoding CD133 was generated
by co-transfection of pCX-puro-CD133 with pVSV-G
(envelope) and pVSV-GP (packaging) plasmids in 293T
cells using lipfectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). N1-S1 cells
were infected with virus-containing medium for 24 hours
and stable expression clones were selected with 2 μg/ml
puromycin (Invitrogen) for 7 days.

PGE2 quantification:
Measurement of secreted PGE2 in culture
supernatant was done by competitive enzyme
immunoassay (EIA) kit (Cayman Chemical, Ann Arbor,
MI).

software (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA).

blocked with 3% hydrogen peroxide for 10 min and
subjected to antigen retrieval in 10 mM citrate buffer for
15 min in a microwave. The slides were incubated with
a 1:50 dilution of CD31, CD133 or CD44 antibody (all
from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA); or a
1:50 dilution of Ki-67 antibody (Cayman Chemical, Ann
Arbor, MI) at 4°C overnight. After the sections were
washed with PBS, they were incubated with horseradish
peroxidase/Fab polymer conjugate (polymer detection
system; Zymed Laboratories, South San Francisco, USA)
for 30 min and detected using diaminobenzidine (1:20
dilution; Zymed Laboratories, South San Francisco, USA).
For immunofluorescence detection of CD31, CD133,
and CD44 in a paraffin-embedded hepatoma section
of HCC, protein blocking was performed for 30 min in
10% fetal calf serum after antigen retrieval in 10 mM
citrate buffer for 15 min in a microwave. CD31, CD133,
and CD44 antibodies (1:50 dilution for all; Santa Cruz
Biotechnology) were applied to the sections, which were
then incubated at room temperature for 2 h, followed by
repeated washing with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS).
Next, tissue sections were incubated with Alexa Fluor 546or Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated IgG (Molecular Probes,
Eugene, OR) for 30 min at room temperature. After the
slides were mounted in mounting media (Dako, Glostrup,
Denmark), they were visualized under a fluorescence
microscope (Leica Microsystems, Schweiz, AG – CH).

Animal experiments
All experimental procedures were reviewed and
approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use
Committee before the study began, and we ensured that
all animals received humane care and that study protocols
complied with the institution’s guidelines. The US-guided
induction of Novikoff hepatoma in Sprague Dawley
(SD) rats was performed as previously described [21]. In
chemopreventive regimen, rats (n =12) were implanted
with N1-S1 cells on day 0, then divided into two groups
receiving saline (n = 6) or celecoxib (30 mg/kg/day; n
= 6) via oral route for 17 days, and sacrificed on day 18
for histological analysis. For therapeutic studies, rats (n
= 32) were implanted with N1-S1 cells on day 0. After
confirming HCC formation by US monitoring on day
10, rats (n = 26) were divided into two groups receiving
saline (n = 13) or celecoxib (30 mg/kg/day; n = 13) via
oral route for additional 7 days, and sacrificed on day 18
for histological analysis. For survival analysis, rats (n =
24) were used for induction of Novikoff hepatoma on day
0. After confirming HCC formation by US monitoring
on day 10, rats (n = 18) were divided into two groups
receiving saline (n = 9) or celecoxib (30 mg/kg/day; n =
9) via oral route for additional 60 days. In adenovirus gene
delivery study, N1-S1 cells were infected with adenovirus
vectors at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 200 for 24
h, implanted into rat under US guidance on day 0. The
hepatoma induction was determined after day 10.

Counting of CD44+/CD133+ hCSCs by flow
cytometry
After 10 μM celecoxib or 1 μM PGE2 treatment in
serum-free medium for 48 hours, cells were incubated
with CD44 and CD133 (1:100 dilution for both; both
were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology) antibodies for 30
min at room temperature and then washed 3 times with
PBS. Next, signals were detected using an Alexa Fluor
488- or 546-conjugated IgG (Molecular Probes). Then, we
used FACS Calibur flow cytometry (Becton Dickinson,
San Jose, CA) to determine the ratio of CD44+/CD133+
hCSCs. All the data were collected and analyzed using the
CellQuest software (Becton Dickinson).

Cell immunofluorescence analysis
After 10 μM celecoxib or vehicle treatment for
48 hours, cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for
10 min and stained with PPARγ, and PTEN antibodies
(1:50 dilution for all; all the antibodies were from Santa
Cruz Biotechnology), followed by an Alexa Fluor 488 or
546-conjugated IgG (Molecular Probes). The cells were
counterstained with DAPI and visualized using a confocal
microscope (Carl Zeiss, Jena, Germany). Quantification
was performed using the ImageJ software (NIH).

Histological analysis
For immunohistochemical analysis, paraffinembedded hepatoma tissue blocks were sectioned into
3-μm-thick slices and mounted on poly(lysine)-coated
slides. After the slides were deparaffinized, they were
