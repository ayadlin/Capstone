Abstract
Calcium signaling is important in many signaling processes in cancer cell proliferation and motility including
in deadly glioblastomas of the brain that aggressively invade neighboring tissue. We hypothesized that disturbing
Ca2+ signaling pathways might decrease the invasive behavior of giloblastoma, extending survival. Evaluating a
panel of small-molecule modulators of Ca2+ signaling, we identified caffeine as an inhibitor of glioblastoma cell
motility. Caffeine, which is known to activate ryanodine receptors, paradoxically inhibits Ca2+ increase by inositol 1,4,5-trisphospate receptor subtype 3 (IP3R3), the expression of which is increased in glioblastoma cells.
Consequently, by inhibiting IP3R3-mediated Ca2+ release, caffeine inhibited migration of glioblastoma cells in
various in vitro assays. Consistent with these effects, caffeine greatly increased mean survival in a mouse xenograft model of glioblastoma. These findings suggest IP3R3 as a novel therapeutic target and identify caffeine as a
possible adjunct therapy to slow invasive growth of glioblastoma. Cancer Res; 70(3); 1173–83. ©2010 AACR.

Introduction
Glioblastoma, the most frequent and malignant tumor in
the central nervous system, has a very poor prognosis, with a
median survival of only 1 year after diagnosis (1, 2). Total surgical removal of glioblastoma is rarely possible because of the
widespread infiltration of brain by neoplastic cells, and nearly all tumors will ultimately fail adjuvant therapy and recur.
Thus, the fundamental source of treatment failure is the insidious propensity of tumor cells to invade normal brain
structures (2, 3). A host of extracellular signaling molecules

activates glioblastoma cells to affect proliferation, motility,
and invasiveness. These signaling molecules include various growth factors, such as epidermal growth factor
(EGF) and platelet-derived growth factor, and G protein–
coupled receptor (GPCR) agonists, such as ATP, bradykinin,
lysophosphatidic acid (LPA), S1P, thrombin, and plasmin
(2). They in turn activate cell surface receptors, such as
EGF receptor (EGFR), PAR1, B2, P2Y, LPA, and S1P receptors (4–6), and modulate downstream effectors of the intracellular signaling pathway. An important consequence of
the intracellular signaling is an increase in intracellular
Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i), which is well known to be a
critical signal for gene expression, motility, differentiation,
and survival. Furthermore, many GPCRs are known to
transactivate and converge onto EGFRs in various cancer
cells (4), aberrantly exacerbating the Ca2+ signaling and
other signaling cascades.
Cancer cell migration depends mainly on actin polymerization and intracellular organization of various cytoskeletal
proteins, which are influenced by a variety of actin binding
proteins (7, 8). Regulation of actin binding protein activity is
mediated by second messengers such as phosphoinositides
and calcium (7, 8). Therefore, the precise mechanism of receptor-mediated Ca2+ increase in glioblastoma cells is an important factor for controlling proliferation, motility, and
invasiveness of these cells (9, 10). However, to date, only a
limited number of studies have been conducted with regard
to Ca2+ signaling in glioblastoma cells.
Caffeine, a well-known activator of ryanodine receptor
(RyR), has been reported to display anticancer effects (11, 12).
Caffeine and its analogues have diverse effects on pain,
Alzheimer's disease, asthma, cancer, diabetes, and Parkinson's

disease (13). Recent studies have shown that caffeine inhibits
metastasis in a mouse mammary tumor model and UV-induced
skin cancer in nude mouse (11, 12). Therefore, we investigated
the detailed Ca2+ signaling pathway of the glioblastoma cells
in response to various receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) and
GPCR agonists and examined the possible target of caffeine.

Materials and Methods
Human surgical tissue samples. All the fresh, surgically
removed tissue samples examined in this study were histologically diagnosed as glioblastoma according to WHO classification. The primary human glioblastoma cells and
astrocytes were obtained from brain tissue of the Brain Bank
of Seoul National University Hospital. This study was
approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB) of Seoul
National University Hospital (IRB approval H-0B05-036-243).
Cell culture. The primary human glioblastoma cells and
astrocytes from the Brain Bank of Seoul National University
Hospital were enzymatically dissociated to single cell from
mechanically dissected glioblastoma and temporal lobe tissues. The cells were then suspended in DMEM (Life Technologies) supplemented with 20% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Life
Technologies). Cultured human glioblastoma cell lines
(U178MG, U87MG, T98G, U373MG, and M059K) were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS, penicillin
(50 units/mL), and streptomycin (50 units/mL). wtEGFR
and ΔEGFR are the U87MG cell line that has a wild-type
EGFR or EGFRvIII (ΔEGFR) mutation, which causes a constitutively active tyrosine kinase activity. These cells were
maintained in the same medium containing 200 μg/mL
G418 as described previously (14–16).
Calcium imaging. For imaging, all cell lines were cultured
as monolayers on 12-mm glass coverslips coated with poly-Dlysine (Sigma). Glioblastoma cells were incubated with
5 μmol/L Fura-2 AM plus 1 μmol/L pluronic acid (Molecular
Probes) for 30 min at room temperature. External solution
contained 150 mmol/L NaCl, 10 mmol/L HEPES, 3 mmol/L
KCl, 2 mmol/L CaCl2, 1 mmol/L MgCl2, 22 mmol/L sucrose,
and 10 mmol/L glucose (pH adjusted to 7.4 and osmolarity to
325 mOsm). INDEC Imaging Workbench version 5.2.10 was
used for acquisition of intensity images and conversion
to ratios. Thrombin (Sigma), S1P (Sigma), LPA (Sigma),
TFLLR (Peptron), 2-methylthio-ATP (2-MT-ATP; Sigma), bradykinin (Sigma), and EGF (Sigma) were used as GPCR and
RTK agonists.
Scrape motility assay. All cell lines were grown as monolayers in 12-well culture plates in serum-containing medium.
Scrapes were made with a 10 μL pipette tip. After caffeine
(Sigma), thapsigargin (Tocris), and ryanodine (Tocris) were
added, plates were returned to the incubator. To prevent proliferation, 10 μmol/L fluorodeoxyuridine/uridine (Sigma) was
added. After incubation for 24 h, the cells were fixed in 4%
paraformaldehyde. The areas of repopulation of three 100×
fields within the scrape areas were determined, and the mean
percentage of scrape area wound closure was determined.
Matrigel invasion assay. Cell invasion was assayed using
Transwell inserts containing 8-μm pore size (Corning) in 24-

1174

well culture plates. For invasion assay, inserts were coated with
2 mg/mL basement membrane Matrigel (BD Biosciences).
Cells (1 × 105) in serum-free medium were plated onto the
upper side of insert, and complete medium was placed in
the lower chamber to act as a chemoattractant. After 24 h
of incubation at 37°C, the cells on the upper side of insert
were removed by wiping with a cotton swab. The cells that
migrated to the lower side of membrane were stained with
4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) and randomly photographed under microscope at ×200 magnification. The mean
number of untreated cells was considered as 100% invasion.
Each condition was duplicated, and five fields were randomly selected and counted for each assay. Caffeine, DPCPX
(Tocris), bicuculline (Tocris), and IBMX (Sigma) were added
at the time of cell plating.
Soft agar colony formation assay. Cells (1 × 104) were
seeded into six-well plates in a soft agar (0.3%) overlaying a
0.6% base agar. The solidified cell layer was covered with medium containing caffeine, which was replaced every 4 d. Cells
were incubated at 37°C for 14 to 17 d to allow colonies to develop. Afterward, colonies were stained with 0.05% cresyl violet
and photographed. Each experiment was done in triplicate.
Transfection. HEK 293T cells were transfected with plasmids carrying various inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor
(IP3R) subunits using Effectene Transfection Reagent (Qiagen)
according to the manufacturer's instructions. U178MG cells
were transfected with plasmids carrying green fluorescent
protein (GFP) or IP3R subtype 3 (IP3R3)–small hairpin RNA
(shRNA)–GFP by using electroporation. A single voltage
(1,100 V) was given for 30 ms by Microporator (Seltagen).
IP 3 uncaging. U178MG cells were colabeled with
200 μmol/L NPE-caged IP3R (Invitrogen) and 100 μmol/L
Oregon Green 488 BAPTA-2 (Invitrogen) by using electroporation. Colabeled U178MG cells were visualized using
Olympus FluoView FV1000 confocal microscope. Caged IP3
was uncaged by 50% of 405-nm laser for 100 ms. Increases
in fluorescence intensity over baseline within region of interest were analyzed using FluoView version 1.7a software.
Organotypic brain slice invasion model. Organotypic
hippocampal slice cultures were prepared and maintained
as described previously (17). Organotypic glioma invasion
model was followed by some modification of the procedure
as previously described (18). Briefly, DiI-stained U178MG
cells (∼5,000 cells) were gently placed on the slices in the
presence or absence of caffeine 6 d after slice preparation.
After 1 and 120 h, movement of the glioma cell in the slices
was detected with an inverted confocal laser scanning microscope (Zeiss LSM5, Carl Zeiss). ImageJ software (NIH) was
used to calculate the invasion area of DiI-stained cells. Invasion area (%) = (area of DiI-stained cells at 120 h/area of DiIstained cells at 1 h) × 100.
Tumor xenografts in nude mice. We used U87MG cell line
in the tumor xenograft models because this cell line has been
widely used due to their high tumorigenicity in nude mouse.
The U178MG cells did not show any tumorigenicity in nude
mouse in the initial attempts to establish xenograft model.
Five-week-old athymic mice (BALB/c nu/nu) were obtained
from Central Laboratory Animal, Inc. For the xenograft tumor

growth assay, U87MG cells (3 × 106/150 μL PBS) were injected
s.c. into the right flanks of the mice (n = 5–10 mice per group).
From the day 7 after injection and on, caffeine was given as
drinking water (1 mg/mL). The control animals were given distilled water. BALB/c nude mice bearing U87MG were randomized into two groups (control and caffeine; n = 13 per group) on
day 7 after tumor inoculation. Caffeine (1 mg/mL) was delivered orally on the day of randomization. Tumor size was measured weekly for 28 d with the use of caliper. Tumor size was
measured twice per week for 4 wk, and tumor volumes were
calculated by the following formula: volume = length × width2/2.
The effect of the caffeine was determined by the growth delay.
To investigate the effects of caffeine on the survival, an orthotopic implantation model was established with U87MG.
U87MG cells (2.5 × 105/5 μL PBS) were implanted by intracranial injections in the left frontal lobe at coordinates 2 mm
lateral from the bregma, 0.5 mm anterior, and 3.5 mm intraparenchymal. Caffeine (1 mg/mL) was given to mice from
1 wk before inoculation. Mice were monitored daily for general
appearance, behavioral changes, and neurologic deficits. Mice
were sacrificed when moribund. All protocols were approved
by the Gyeongsang National University Institutional Animal
Care and Use Committee. The survival data were analyzed by
log-rank Kaplan-Meier method using SigmaStat (version 3.0).
Caffeine concentration in serum and brain. After 2-wk
administration of caffeine through drinking water (1 mg/mL),
animals were sacrificed. Serum and brain tissue contents of
caffeine were measured by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) as previously described (19).
Microarray analysis. The microarray analysis was performed on tissue samples of 34 normal brain tissue from lobectomy patients and 51 glioma from human glioblastoma
patients. The detailed method is available in Supplementary
Materials and Methods.

Results
Ca2+ signaling in glioblastoma cells. We first examined
the effect of activating RTKs and GPCRs on Ca2+ signaling
pathway by performing Ca 2+ imaging experiments from
Fura-2 AM–loaded, cultured human glioblastoma cell lines
and acutely dissociated glioblastoma cells prepared from surgically removed tissue. A bath application of 100 ng/mL EGF
to cultured U178MG and U87MG glioblastoma cell lines
induced a robust [Ca2+]i increases (Fig. 1A). EGF induced
Ca2+ responses regardless of the status of EGFR—whether
it was wild-type or the constitutively active deletion mutant
ΔEGFR of U87MG cell line (Fig. 1A). U178MG cells also
showed robust Ca2+ responses by various GPCR agonists
(Fig. 1B). The acutely dissociated glioblastoma cells prepared
from surgically removed tissue (Fig. 1C) also showed robust
Ca2+ responses by TFLLR, EGF, and bradykinin (Fig. 1D).
These results show the functional expression of various RTKs
and GPCRs, whose activation leads to increases in [Ca2+]i.
We found that an increase in [Ca2+]i in these cells was contributed in part by a release of Ca2+ from intracellular release
pools and subsequently by a Ca2+ entry through the storeoperated channels (Supplementary Fig. S1A–C). The release

www.aacrjournals.org

of Ca2+ from intracellular stores was completely inhibited by
1 μmol/L U73122, an inhibitor of phospholipase C (PLC),
which produces IP3 by metabolism of phosphoinositol-4,5bisphosphate in response to an activation of GPCRs and RTKs
(Supplementary Fig. S1D). From these results, we concluded
that glioblastoma cells express various surface receptors that
are coupled to the common phosphoinositide pathway that
leads to Ca2+ release from intracellular stores and subsequent
Ca2+ influx through store-operated channels.
Caffeine inhibits IP3-mediated Ca2+ release. There are
two known ion channels primarily responsible for release
of Ca2+ from intracellular stores: IP3Rs and RyRs. Caffeine
has been classically known to induce a release of Ca2+ from
intracellular stores by opening RyRs, especially in muscle
cells and cardiac myocytes (13). Thus, we tested caffeine
along with other agents that enhance or disturb the Ca2+ release machinery in various assays for glioblastoma motility,
invasion, and proliferation. Contrary to our expectations, we
found that caffeine significantly and concentration dependently (1–10 mmol/L) inhibited the motility, invasion, and
proliferation of various human glioblastoma cell lines, including U178MG, U87MG, and T98G cells (Fig. 2A–C), while
minimally affecting the cell viability at this concentration
range (data not shown). This paradoxical effect of caffeine
was mimicked by other agents that are known to disturb intracellular concentration of Ca2+, such as 1 μmol/L thapsigargin (Fig. 2A), 10 μmol/L 2-aminoethoxydiphenyl borate,
20 μmol/L cyclopiazonic acid, and 50 μmol/L BAPTA-AM
(data not shown). However, 10 μmol/L ryanodine, an agonist
of RyRs at this concentration, did not show this inhibitory
effect on migration and invasion (Fig. 2A). Furthermore, the
blocking concentration of ryanodine at 100 μmol/L was not
able to inhibit the bradykinin-induced Ca2+ increase (Supplementary Fig. S1E). These results suggested that the mode of
action of caffeine might not be related to opening of RyRs.
Caffeine has been shown to inhibit adenosine receptors,
GABAA receptors, phosphodiesterase activity, and G2 checkpoint for repair of damaged DNA (13). We tested whether modulating these target molecules affects the invasiveness of
glioblastoma cells. The A1 adenosine receptor blocker DPCPX
(800 nmol/L), GABAA receptor blocker bicuculline (10 μmol/L),
and phosphodiesterase inhibitor IBMX (100 μmol/L) had no
significant effect on invasion (Fig. 2B, right), suggesting that
the mode of action of caffeine might be at other targets.
Caffeine has been also reported to inhibit IP3Rs without
affecting IP3 binding at millimolar concentrations (20), possibly by competing at the ATP binding site of IP3Rs (21).
Therefore, we tested whether caffeine can inhibit the increase in [Ca2+]i on activation of GPCRs and RTKs in cultured U178MG cells. We found that caffeine significantly
inhibited the bradykinin-induced, EGF-induced, and the
PAR1 agonist TFLLR–induced increase in [Ca2+]i (Fig. 3A
and B) in a concentration-dependent manner with halfmaximal concentration of 2.45 and 1.81 mmol/L for TFLLRand EGF-induced responses, respectively (Fig. 3B). This
inhibitory action of caffeine was not due to an inhibition of
store-operated channels (Supplementary Fig. S2A), a depletion
of Ca2+ stores (Supplementary Fig. S2B–D), or an activation of

effect was significantly inhibited in the presence of caffeine
(Fig. 3C), supporting the conclusion that caffeine directly inhibits IP3R-mediated Ca2+ release.
IP3R3 is required for caffeine sensitivity. We then tested
whether the inhibitory action of caffeine on Ca2+ responses
was also observed in other cell types. We found that a variety
of cell types displayed varying degree of inhibition of Ca2+ responses by caffeine, with the highest block in U178MG and the

lowest block in human astrocytes (Fig. 4A). To see if the degree
of block by caffeine is correlated with IP3R expression, we performed semiquantitative reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR)
for three subtypes of IP3R mRNA for each cell type (Fig. 4B).
Of the three subtypes of IP3R, expression of IP3R3 showed the
highest correlation with the percent block of Ca2+ responses
(coefficient of correlation r2 = 0.891; P < 0.001; Fig. 4B), suggesting that the effect of caffeine on Ca2+ increase might be linked

to the expression level of IP3R3. We also performed semiquantitative RT-PCR for the three subtypes of IP3R on glioblastoma
patient tissue samples and compared with normal tissue samples from lobectomy surgery. We found that glioblastoma tissue displayed on average >2-fold increase in expression of
IP3R3 mRNA compared with the normal tissue, whereas
IP3R2 mRNA was unchanged and IP3R1 significantly decreased
(Fig. 4C). This is consistent with the high percentage of block
of Ca2+ responses by caffeine in acutely prepared human glioblastoma cells (Fig. 4A). These results indicate that the expression of IP3R3 is significantly correlated with the inhibitory
action of caffeine on Ca2+ responses.
To confirm that the inhibitory action of caffeine on Ca2+
response is specific to IP3R3, we either overexpressed IP3R3

1178

into HEK 293T cells that normally lack IP3R3 or inhibited the
expression of IP3R3 using shRNA in U178MG cells that highly
express IP3R3. In HEK 293T cells heterologously expressing
IP 3 R3, the block percentage of TFLLR-induced Ca 2+ responses by caffeine was significantly increased compared
with the IP3R1- or IP3 R2-overexpressing HEK 293T cells
(Fig. 5A). To silence the IP3R3 mRNA in U178MG cells, we
first developed a shRNA that is specific to IP3R3 mRNA by
screening several candidate hairpin-forming oligomers, one
of which (candidate 3) selectively reduced the IP3R3 mRNA
expression without affecting mRNA levels for the other IP3R
subtypes (Supplementary Fig. S3A). Subsequent testing of the
shRNA on U178MG cells revealed that gene silencing of IP3R3
in U178MG suppressed the caffeine sensitivity of Ca 2+

responses in these cells (Fig. 5C; Supplementary Fig. S3B) but
not by the control vector containing GFP only (Fig. 5B; Supplementary Fig. S3B). Interestingly, gene silencing of IP3R3 in
U178MG caused a general reduction in TFLLR- or bradykinininduced Ca2+ responses (Fig. 5C), suggesting that IP3R3 is the
major Ca2+ release channels in these cells. These results indicate that IP3R3 is critical for the inhibitory action of caffeine.
Moreover, glioblastoma cells show aberrant increase in expression of this subtype (Fig. 4C), providing a potential target
for treatments aimed at altering glioblastoma migration and
invasion.
Next, we examined whether gene silencing by shRNA for
IP3R3 in U178MG cells would make these cells less sensitive
to caffeine in Matrigel invasion assay. As expected, gene silencing of IP3R3 by shRNA rendered these cells significantly

less sensitive to caffeine treatment in Matrigel invasion assay
compared with the GFP vector–expressing cells (P < 0.01,
t test; transfection efficiency, ∼30%; Fig. 5D). These results
indicate that IP3R3 confers caffeine sensitivity on invasion
of U178MG cells.
Caffeine inhibits invasion and increases survival rate.
To translate the results from the in vitro experiments, we examined the effect of caffeine on brain slices and in in vivo
animal models, in which local microenvironments could
compromise the effect of caffeine. In mouse brain slices in
culture, we placed 1 μL of DiI-labeled U178MG cells
(∼5,000 cells) in hippocampal region after 6 days in culture
and examined the radial progression of these cells to neighboring regions 5 days after the placement. We found that the
invasion of DiI-labeled U178MG cells was significantly lower

tumor mass compared with control mice at 35 days after implantation (Fig. 6C). In an intracranial xenograft model of
glioblastoma using U87MG cells, the same dose of caffeine
improved the survival of tumor-bearing mice (mean survival
time, 38 days) compared with control (mean survival time,
28 days; Fig. 6D). It has been reported that when caffeine
(0.44 mg/mL) was treated in the drinking water for 2 weeks,
serum concentration in mice was near 6 μg/mL (22), which
was approximately the same concentration in people drinking
two to five cups of coffee per day (23). Because the brain concentration of caffeine was highly correlated with serum concentration (19) and our experimental mice received 1 mg/mL
drinking water for >2 weeks, we predicted that the brain
concentration should be at least 6 μg/mL (equivalent to
0.03 mmol/L). We then directly measured the serum and
brain content of caffeine after caffeine treatment using

HPLC as previously described (19). The measured caffeine
concentrations were not very different from the predicted
values (serum content, 7.134 ± 1.089 μg/mL; brain content,
6.135 ± 0.368 μg/mL).
Molecules in Ca2+ signaling pathway are upregulated in
glioblastoma. To see if the molecules in the phosphoinositide and Ca 2+ signaling pathway in glioblastoma are
changed, we have performed genome-wide DNA chip microarray analysis on 51 tissue samples from glioblastoma patients and compared with 34 normal tissue samples from
lobectomy surgery (Supplementary Fig. S4A). We found that
most of molecules that are in the signaling pathway of
phosphoinositide production and Ca2+ release showed an
average of >2-fold increase in mRNA expression in glioblastoma patient samples. These include PAR1 (7.7-fold increase), EGFR (3.1-fold increase), PLCβ3 (1.4-fold increase),

PLCγ1 (1.4-fold increase), IP 3R3 (2.3-fold increase), and
TRPC6 (2.1-fold increase). However, RyRs did not show any
significant increase. The gene tree analysis also shows clusters
of genes related to upstream or downstream signaling pathway
whose expression is significantly increased (Supplementary
Fig. S4B). The enhanced Ca2+ signaling provides a source of
Ca2+ that is sensitive to caffeine and critical for motility, invasion, and possibly cell division of glioblastoma cells (Supplementary Fig. S4C).

Discussion
We have initially started with a simple hypothesis that inhibiting the Ca2+ signaling pathway would inhibit the invasive and motile behavior of glioblastoma cells. Similar to
normal glial cells, glioblastoma cells show robust Ca2+ increases on activation of various GPCR and RTK agonists
(Fig. 1). The major source of Ca2+ increase was found to be
the release of intracellular Ca2+ stores through IP3Rs and subsequent trigger of influx through the store-operated channels
on depletion of the intracellular stores (Supplementary
Fig. S1A and B). Of the three subtypes of IP3R, we found that
IP3R3 is overexpressed in various glioblastoma cell lines and
glioblastoma patient samples, whereas normal astrocytes
showed virtually no expression of IP3R3 (Fig. 4B and C). On
the other hand, IP3R1 was significantly decreased in glioblastoma tissues (Fig. 4C), making IP3R3 as the major contributor
of Ca2+ signaling in these cells.
IP3Rs are difficult to study especially due to the lack of
suitable inhibitors and subtype-specific blockers. We found
that caffeine paradoxically inhibited IP3R-mediated Ca2+ responses in a subtype 3–specific manner (Fig. 5). Using caffeine as a tool to inhibit IP3R3-mediated Ca2+ release, we
have shown that inhibiting IP3R3 effectively reduced the
migration, invasion, and survival of glioblastoma cells
(Fig. 2). The gene silencing of IP3R3 by shRNA also effectively
reduced the caffeine sensitivity of Ca2+ signaling and invasiveness in the Matrigel invasion assay (Fig. 5). Our results

are the first to show the involvement of IP3R3 in glioblastoma
Ca2+ signaling and invasion. Furthermore, we suggest that
IP3R3 can be specifically targeted for therapeutic intervention in glioblastoma patients with minimal influence on normal glial as well as neuronal functions.
Whether caffeine can directly affect the gating of IP3R3
channels is still unknown. However, according to previous
studies showing that caffeine can compete with ATP binding to IP3Rs (21) at millimolar concentrations (20), caffeine
could selectively bind to IP3R3 and affect the gating of
IP3R3. Further work is required to investigate the direct role
of caffeine on IP3R3 gating in comparison with other subtypes of IP3R.
In summary, our study provides IP3R3 as a novel therapeutic target for glioblastoma treatment. Our study also provides
new insights into the detailed molecular mechanism of caffeine action on migration and invasion of glioblastoma. The
apparent beneficial effect of caffeine suggested by our study
should trigger future investigations of the therapeutic potential for caffeine to treat this deadly disease that otherwise has
no cure.
