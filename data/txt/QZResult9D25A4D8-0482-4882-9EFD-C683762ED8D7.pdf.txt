BACKGROUND: Understanding of cancer outcomes is limited by data fragmentation. In the current study, the authors analyzed the
information yielded by integrating breast cancer data from 3 sources: electronic medical records (EMRs) from 2 health care systems
and the state registry. METHODS: Diagnostic test and treatment data were extracted from the EMRs of all patients with breast cancer
treated between 2000 and 2010 in 2 independent California institutions: a community-based practice (Palo Alto Medical Foundation;
“Community”) and an academic medical center (Stanford University; “University”). The authors incorporated records from the
population-based California Cancer Registry and then linked EMR-California Cancer Registry data sets of Community and University
patients. RESULTS: The authors initially identified 8210 University patients and 5770 Community patients; linked data sets revealed a
16% patient overlap, yielding 12,109 unique patients. The percentage of all Community patients, but not University patients, treated at
both institutions increased with worsening cancer prognostic factors. Before linking the data sets, Community patients appeared to
receive less intervention than University patients (mastectomy: 37.6% vs 43.2%; chemotherapy: 35% vs 41.7%; magnetic resonance
imaging: 10% vs 29.3%; and genetic testing: 2.5% vs 9.2%). Linked Community and University data sets revealed that patients treated
at both institutions received substantially more interventions (mastectomy: 55.8%; chemotherapy: 47.2%; magnetic resonance imaging: 38.9%; and genetic testing: 10.9% [P <.001 for each 3-way institutional comparison]). CONCLUSIONS: Data linkage identified 16%
of patients who were treated in 2 health care systems and who, despite comparable prognostic factors, received far more intensive
treatment than others. By integrating complementary data from EMRs and population-based registries, a more comprehensive underC 2013 American Cancer
standing of breast cancer care and factors that drive treatment use was obtained. Cancer 2014;120:103-11. V

INTRODUCTION
Advances in breast cancer diagnosis and treatment1-4 offer many effective options, and raise questions about the comparative effectiveness of different care pathways.5-7 National initiatives prioritize comparing the effectiveness of treatments in
diverse practice settings,8-10 requiring demographic and long-term follow-up data from their populations.11-13 Studies of
real-world cancer outcomes, outside of clinical trials, have been limited by the fragmentation and lack of detail in available
data. Population-based registries such as the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Program excel at tracking demographics and incidence, but lack essential details regarding treatments and diagnostic tests.14,15 Institutional electronic medical records (EMR) contain extensive treatment information; however, they are subject to a measurement bias
of unknown magnitude, namely the underreporting of care delivered outside the institution and its outcomes.
Linking EMR-derived data across health care systems offers the promise of more complete information, as well as
the challenge of disagreement between institutions, which may require laborious review of patients’ charts for resolution.

Original Article

We linked data from the EMRs of an academic medical
center and a multisite community practice in the same
catchment region. To provide a gold standard for patient
identification and treatment summaries, we also linked to
the statewide population-based California Cancer Registry (CCR; a SEER component).16 Our hypothesis was
that this 3-way data linkage would offer a practical and
scalable approach for identifying patients treated in more
than 1 health care system, and would provide information
concerning variability in cancer care that could not be
obtained otherwise.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Data Resource Environment

Our project (Oncoshare) began in 2009 to integrate data
from EMRs of Stanford University Hospital (SU) and the
Palo Alto Medical Foundation (PAMF). SU is an academic medical center; PAMF is a multisite community
practice located in Alameda, San Mateo, Santa Clara, and
Santa Cruz counties in California. SU (“University”) is
within 1 mile of the nearest PAMF (“Community”) site.
Community patients have health maintenance organization and fee-for-service insurance; University patients
have various insurance plans, including Medicaid.
Although inpatient care provided by Community physicians sometimes occurs in University facilities, the institutions are legally and financially separate, with
nonoverlapping staff. All research was approved by University and Community Institutional Review Boards and
the State of California Institutional Review Board (for use
of CCR data).
Clinical Data Extraction

We extracted data from University and Community
EMRs (Epic Systems, Verona, Wis) and from a University
warehouse for clinical data collected before Epic implementation in 2007. All University clinical systems data
since the mid-1990s reside in the Stanford Translational
Research Integrated Database Environment (STRIDE), a
warehouse and integration platform for research data
extraction and analysis.17 Real-time electronic data feeds
supply clinical information to STRIDE via Health Level
Seven International (HL7) technology; extract, transform,
and load processes out of Epic and into STRIDE occur
daily. STRIDE contains 1 terabyte of data in the form of
transcribed dictations and physicians’ text notes, billing
codes, laboratory and pharmacy orders, medication and
radiotherapy administration records, laboratory results,
and radiology and pathology reports. University chemotherapy data have been available from the Epic Beacon
104

provider order entry system since 2008. Community clinical data are housed in 3 EMR systems: Epic for everything except chemotherapy orders; IDX medical billing
software (GE Healthcare, Pittsburgh, Pa) for billing information; and IntelliDose (IntrinsiQ, AmerisourceBergen
Specialty Group, Burlington, Mass), an ancillary computer system dedicated to chemotherapy and used since
2000. To ensure uniform coding, chemotherapy data elements in each EMR were mapped to RxNorm,18 a standardized drug lexicon, and diagnostic test data elements
were mapped to National Cancer Institute codes.19 We
identified clinically important interventions, including
surgery, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy, and emerging
diagnostic tests (breast magnetic resonance imaging
[MRI], positron emission tomography [PET], and genetic
testing for BRCA1 and BRCA2 [BRCA1=2] mutations).
We excluded interventions occurring > 90 days before
cancer diagnosis.
CCR Data Addition

We requested CCR records, with all data fields including
age, race=ethnicity, tumor stage, tumor grade, histology,
receptors (estrogen receptor [ER], progesterone receptor
[PR], and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2
[HER2]), and treatment summaries (comprising reports
from any California institution of a patient having receiving surgery, chemotherapy, and=or radiotherapy) for all
patients with breast cancer treated at University and=or
Community facilities from 2000 through 2010. Census
block groups were geocoded based on patients’ residential
addresses at the time of diagnoses. The 3% of individuals
whose address could not be precisely geocoded were
assigned to a census block group within their county of
residence. We assigned neighborhood socioeconomic status (SES) using a previously developed and widely used
index that incorporates 2000 US Census data regarding
education, income, occupation, and housing costs, based
on selection via principal components analysis.20 We categorized this measure by quintiles based on the distribution
of the composite SES index across California. CCR and
EMR records were linked using names, social security
numbers, medical record numbers, and birthdates. All
personal identifying information was removed, and clinical encounter dates were randomly offset by 30 days
before research use of the data.21
Patient Cohort Identification

We defined cohorts representing all patients treated for
breast cancer at Community and=or University facilities
from January 1, 2000 through January 1, 2010. Eligible

patients were female, aged  18 years, and met at least 1
of the following criteria within the period: 1) the CCR
reported a breast cancer diagnosis and=or treatment at
Community and=or University facilities; and 2) University and=or Community billing records included a diagnostic code for breast cancer or ductal carcinoma in situ
(International Classification of Diseases, 9th revision
[ICD-9] codes 174.9 or 233.0), billed by a breast cancer
specialist (defined as a surgeon, medical oncologist, or
radiation oncologist). The treating institution was based
on clinician affiliation, not location; a Community surgeon operating at the University was coded as Community. Institution was determined first by EMR-based
billing records. Patients who had University records of
undergoing breast cancer-specific interventions (surgery,
chemotherapy, and radiotherapy) were coded as University, and likewise for Community, as confirmed by the
CCR. For patients lacking treatment records, the institution was defined by billing records for cancer-related diagnostic tests including PET and genetic testing, and if there
were no such records, by presence in University or Community internal tumor registries, which report to the
CCR. MRI was not used to determine treating institution
because before 2006 some Community patients visited
the University for MRI only. After generating separate
University and Community cohorts (defined hereafter as
“EMR-CCR cohorts”), we linked these 2 EMR-CCR
cohorts to identify patients treated at both institutions.
Quality Assurance and Analytical Cohort
Development

We validated and applied an algorithm to link records
across data sources.21,22 To ensure subjects’ eligibility, we
developed analytical cohorts, from which we excluded
patients lacking data regarding all of the following (considered essential for analyzing breast cancer care): stage of
disease, tumor receptors (ER, PR, and HER2), and any
diagnostic or treatment intervention. We applied more
stringent inclusion criteria for patients identified in
EMRs only but not in the CCR, because review of physicians’ notes and pathology reports in EMRs revealed that
many such patients had received breast cancer ICD-9
codes erroneously, often coincident with prophylactic
mastectomy or tamoxifen used for breast cancer risk
reduction. These stringent inclusion criteria were cancerspecific pathology data (stage and=or tumor receptors)
and treatments (chemotherapy and=or radiotherapy).
This algorithm was applied within each institution before
linking EMR-CCR cohorts, and to the overall cohort after
linkage.

Statistical Analysis

Patient characteristics, receipt of treatments, and diagnostic tests were tabulated before and after linkage of University and Community EMR-CCR cohorts. After linkage,
measures for patients treated at University, Community,
and both institutions (“Both”) were compared using the
chi-square statistic. All P values were 2-sided.
RESULTS
Analytical Cohorts

We identified a maximally inclusive University cohort of
8892 patients. Applying our eligibility criteria left 8210
patients (92.3%) in the University analytical cohort.
Repeating these steps, we identified a maximally inclusive
Community cohort of 6304 patients, and retained 5770
(91.5%) in the Community analytical cohort; adding
these cohorts produced an apparent total of 13,980
patients. Linked records from the University and Community EMR-CCR cohorts yielded a maximally inclusive
cohort of 13,238 unique patients, of whom we retained
12,109 (91.5%) in the combined analytical cohort
(Fig. 1).
Patient Characteristics Before and After EMRCCR Cohort Linkage

Before linking University and Community EMR-CCR
cohorts, University patients appeared to be younger, with
a lower SES and worse cancer prognostic factors than
Community patients (Table 1). Linked EMR-CCR
cohorts identified a third group of patients who were
treated at both institutions (defined hereafter as “Both”).
Both patients were significantly more likely to be Asian
(University-only, 14%; Community-only, 13.9%; and
Both, 17.2%) and of highest-quintile SES (Universityonly, 49.2%; Community-only, 64.6%; and Both,
75.2%). Both patients had intermediate prognostic factors, including age (< 40 years: University-only, 10.9%;
Community-only, 3.7%; and Both, 10%), stage (III or
IV: University-only, 13.6%; Community-only, 6.8%;
and Both, 10.2%), tumor receptor subtype (for the poorprognosis subtypes,23 HER2-positive or ER-, PR-, and
HER2 negative: University-only, 29.1%; Communityonly, 14.5%; and Both, 25.9%), and grade (grade 3:
University-only, 32.3%; Community-only, 19.8%; and
Both, 29.5% [P < .001 for each reported 3-way comparison]). As prognostic factors worsened, including decreasing age, increasing stage of disease, increasing grade, and
less favorable receptor subtype,24-26 an increasing percentage of Community patients (but not University patients)
fell into the Both category.

from EMRs, through providers’ notes and billing (Table
2). For example, CCR data identified approximately 95%
of all women with evidence from any source of having
undergone mastectomy, but institution-specific data identified only 25% to 50% of these cases. For women in the
Both category, the institution-specific data performed
better, reflecting a greater yield from combining EMRderived data from 2 institutions. For chemotherapy,
Community billing data offered somewhat more complete case finding than those from the University. Linked
University and Community EMR-CCR cohorts revealed
that the use of all interventions was highest among the
Both patients. For example, mastectomy use was 39.7%
for University-only, 30.5% for Community-only, and
55.8% for Both, and these data were similar for bilateral
mastectomy (University-only, 8%; Community-only,
5.2%; and Both, 13.2%). Figure 2 illustrates the differential use of MRI among patients in the University-only
(32.9%), Community-only (32.8%), and Both (66%)
categories by 2009 (P < .001 for each 3-way comparison).

(Bottom) University and Community combined.

DISCUSSION
To study breast cancer care beyond the walls of a single
institution, we linked state registry records with data
extracted from the EMRs of 2 health care systems, one of
which was community-based and one of which was
university-affiliated. This 3-way data linkage generated
unique insights. We found a 16% patient overlap between
nearby health care systems, which enables an estimate of
the magnitude of missing treatment information in
single-institution studies. We discovered a striking care
pattern, with Community patients increasingly likely to
be treated at both institutions as their cancer prognosis
worsened, and with Both patients receiving the most intensive intervention despite having intermediate cancer
prognostic factors. These findings illustrate how efforts to
compare outcomes across real-world settings must
account for measured and unmeasured risk factors and
patient preferences.
Previous studies have integrated complementary
databases, supplementing SEER-derived data with treatment details from Medicare claims27,28 and health maintenance organizations.29,30 This study’s novelty lies in
linking data from the EMRs of nearby yet independent
health care systems, anchored by data from the CCR, a
SEER component. We assessed data quality by reviewing
several hundred deidentified patient records and evaluating agreement between all sources; rare conflicts were
adjudicated by physician review.21,22 The 3-way linkage
identified the most informative source for each variable,

with the CCR being most informative regarding treatment use, and EMRs the only source of diagnostic test
data. Missing data were reduced by the 3-way linkage,
with Both patients having the most data available.
We encountered limitations in extracting research
data from EMRs. We extracted structured data from billing, drug ordering, and administration records, and performed simple natural language processing of diagnostic
reports, but many important concepts remain buried in
the unstructured paragraphs of the clinicians’ notes. These
include nuances of decision-making that lack representation elsewhere, notably physician recommendations and
patient preferences. EMRs also promise a wealth of clinical detail that cannot be obtained from administrative
databases or registries, including the images and reports of
radiologic examinations and genomic sequencing tests.
Some of this information can be extracted and encoded as
discrete data elements (for example, Breast ImagingReporting and Data System [BI-RADS] scores for mammogram and breast MRI), whereas identifying the determinants of treatment choices may require advances in
natural language processing. The accurate retrieval of such
specific patient information from unstructured, free-text
EMR notes remains an active area of research.31,32 Given
the unique potential of EMRs to enhance the understanding of cancer outcomes, studies to optimize the clinical
and research uses of EMRs should remain a high priority.33,34 Some limitations may be addressed through
EMR changes, with structured fields facilitating data
extraction; others require new data sources, including
patient-reported information.8,35 Bridging such gaps

should be a priority of emerging data integration initiatives.36,37 Health information technology is developing
rapidly, and the decade between 2000 and 2010 witnessed
the implementation of EMRs and complementary databases. EMR modules for clinical data exchange between
University and Community (Care Everywhere network;
Epic Systems) and between patients and physicians
(Patient Portal; Epic Systems) were activated in 2012, and
should enhance both clinical care and research. In the
future, standardized data representation models will facilitate the interoperability of digital health data between
institutions.
Patients in the Both category offer an intriguing
glimpse across health care systems. This category comprised 16% of patients, disproportionately representing
those with top-quintile SES and intermediate cancer
prognostic factors. Without information regarding physician referrals and patient preferences, we do not know
why patients accessed both systems, but the overrepresentation of sicker Community patients in the Both category
suggests tertiary center consultation on challenging cases.
The Both patients are remarkable for their significantly
greater use of every intervention studied, including mastectomy, chemotherapy, radiotherapy, MRI, PET, and
genetic testing. One explanation might be that
University-only and Community-only patients actually
accessed other health care systems, leading us to underestimate their test use; however, such potential underascertainment cannot explain treatment differences recorded in
the CCR, which aggregates statewide cancer data comprehensively because of mandated reporting. Previous studies
reported rising mastectomy rates38-42 despite a lack of survival benefit,4,43,44 and found correlations with an
increase in diagnostic testing.39,45,46 The high SES noted
among patients in the Both category might explain their
greater use of interventions that are usually considered
optional, such as MRI and bilateral mastectomy,25,47-50
but we lack information regarding other factors that may
drive use of these interventions, including family cancer
history and clinical trial participation. Assessing the value
added by specific interventions51-53 will require a deeper
understanding of the patient, physician, and health care
factors that shape the care patterns we observed.
Integrating breast cancer data from 2 EMRs and the
state registry proved feasible and informative, and broadened our understanding of care beyond what could be
achieved from just one or two data sources. This approach
offers insight regarding real-world treatment across health
care systems, which can advance comparative effectiveness
and outcomes research in oncology.
