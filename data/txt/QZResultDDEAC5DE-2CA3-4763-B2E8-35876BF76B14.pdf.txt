Abstract
Apoptotic evasion is a hallmark of cancer. We propose that some cancers may
evade cell death by regulating 3’-5’-cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), which
is associated with pro-apoptotic signaling. We hypothesize that leukemic cells possess
mechanisms that efflux cAMP from the cytoplasm, thus protecting them from apoptosis.
Accordingly, cAMP efflux inhibition should result in: cAMP accumulation, activation of
cAMP-dependent downstream signaling, viability loss, and apoptosis. We developed
a novel assay to assess cAMP efflux and performed screens to identify inhibitors.
In an acute myeloid leukemia (AML) model, several identified compounds reduced
cAMP efflux, appropriately modulated pathways that are responsive to cAMP elevation
(cAMP-responsive element-binding protein phosphorylation, and deactivation of Very
Late Antigen-4 integrin), and induced mitochondrial depolarization and caspase
activation. Blocking adenylyl cyclase activity was sufficient to reduce effects of the
most potent compounds. These compounds also decreased cAMP efflux and viability
of B-lineage acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) cell lines and primary patient
samples, but not of normal primary peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Our data
suggest that cAMP efflux is a functional feature that could be therapeutically targeted
in leukemia. Furthermore, because some of the identified drugs are currently used for
treating other illnesses, this work creates an opportunity for repurposing.

INTRODUCTION

The effect of intracellular cAMP (icAMP) elevation
is tissue/cell specific. In certain tumors, including
pituitary, adrenocortical and thyroid adenomas and
carcinomas, the cAMP/ protein kinase A (PKA) pathway
provides signals required for tumor development and/or
cell survival. In leukemias/lymphomas, cAMP elevation
can be pro-apoptotic, whereas in leukocytes/macrophages
it is reported to be anti-apoptotic (see Tables 1 and 2 in ref.
[3], [4]). Additionally, cAMP can have both pro- and antiapoptotic activity within the same cell depending upon
experimental conditions. icAMP compartmentalization
may also contribute to the complexity of signaling [5].

Apoptosis serves as a natural barrier to cancer
development, and targeting this cancer hallmark represents
an indispensable therapeutic strategy [1] . Apoptosis can
be induced via two major pathways, extrinsic and intrinsic,
and in acute myelogenic leukemia (AML) the latter can
be directly triggered by elevation of cAMP, which acts
synergistically with first-line antileukemic agents [2].
This creates a unique situation, where an additional
targetable pathway, previously unexploited by traditional
chemotherapeutics, may exist in AML cells [2].

Nonetheless, a significant body of literature suggests that
modulating the cAMP pathway provides a number of
promising targets for treating leukemia [6].
AML (IPC-81) and multiple myeloma cells undergo
rapid apoptosis after cAMP elevation [7, 8]. In S49 T-cell
lymphoma cells, apoptosis can be induced through a
cAMP/PKA-dependent pathway [9]. Increasing icAMP
by using cAMP analogues [10], adenylyl cyclase (AC)
stimulators [11], or phosphodiesterase (PDE) inhibitors
[12, 13] has been a focus of cancer therapeutics research
[3, 14]. This approach has been supported by the fact that
the concentration of cyclic nucleotides is elevated in the
plasma and urine of individuals with certain leukemias
[15, 16], and in some cases these levels correlate with
disease progression [16]. In this report, we hypothesize
that one mechanism for malignant cell apoptotic evasion
could be active efflux of cAMP [14]. Rather than relying
on PDEs to degrade icAMP, active cAMP removal from
the cytoplasm can provide a survival advantage. We
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

envision that cAMP efflux prevents an elevation of icAMP
that could trigger up-regulation of the Bcl-2 interacting
mediator of cell death (Bim/BCL2L11) protein [2, 17], or
down-regulation of the myeloid cell leukemia 1 (Mcl-1)
protein [8, 18]. Inhibition of cAMP efflux alone should
be sufficient to selectively trigger death in cells that rely
on this anti-apoptotic mechanism for survival. To test this
idea, we decided to identify drug-like compounds that are
capable of blocking cAMP efflux.
To identify “inhibitors of cAMP efflux” (ICE), we
developed and validated a novel assay for the detection
of cAMP efflux (in press), using a well characterized
model for AML known to efflux cAMP through ABCC4,
the multidrug resistance-associated protein-4 (MRP4)
transporter [19]. Next, we screened libraries composed
of biologically active substances and off-patent drugs.
We validated the “hits” in secondary assays that assessed
the compound effects on cell signaling, viability and
apoptosis. The ICE were also tested for their effects on

cAMP efflux inhibition and viability in B-lineage acute
lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) cells, primary B-ALL
bone marrow patient samples, and healthy human primary
blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). The most promising
compounds showed dose-dependent, selective inhibition
of leukemic cells vs. PBMCs. Our hypothesis was
further supported by measurements of cAMP-dependent
activation of downstream effectors after exposure to ICE
compounds. Because several identified ICE are FDAapproved drugs, our studies provide a potential path for
drug repurposing against leukemias.

cryptotanshinone, dihydroartemisinin, patulin, and
parthenolide were chosen for extended studies (Table 1).
The detailed screening data will be published elsewhere
(in press).

Correlation between ICE ability to block F-cAMP
efflux and viability loss
Next, we compared ICE efficacy for blocking
F-cAMP efflux with their ability to trigger loss of cell
viability (Figure 2). A strong positive correlation (r2
= 0.73) has been observed. The values for all six ICE
compounds and MK-571 control ranked in the same
order and were located within 95% confidence interval.
Moreover, the slope of the regression line was equal to 1.
This suggests that the relative potency of ICE in affecting
cell viability varies in parallel with the ability to block
F-cAMP efflux.

RESULTS
A screen for ICE identifies six potentially active
compounds
To identify ICE, we took advantage of a model
system where cAMP efflux is well studied: U937 cells,
which can actively extrude cAMP into extracellular
media [19]. In these cells, a rapid increase of cAMP efflux
can be triggered through the elevation of the icAMP
concentration using G-alphaS GPCR-specific ligands,
blocking PDE-dependent cAMP hydrolysis, and by other
pharmacological manipulations. The cAMP efflux is ATPand MRP inhibitor-dependent, and shRNA knockdown
has shown that the cAMP efflux is mediated by MRP4/
ABCC4. Moreover, an increase of icAMP was sufficient
to induce differentiation of U937 and other AML cell lines
[19].
To study cAMP efflux, we loaded U937 cells with
fluorescently tagged cAMP (F-cAMP). MK-571, (MRPs
selective inhibitor) [19], was used as a positive control.
Figure 1 shows that MK-571 down-modulated cAMP
efflux in a dose-dependent manner, with EC50 ~30 µM.
This value was very close to the IC50 previously reported
for MRP4/ABCC4 [20]. Thus, the fluorescent tag (Alexa
Fluor®488) did not significantly affect the ability of cells
to efflux cAMP nor of MK-571 to block this process.
These experiments served as the basis for a screen
to identify compounds that could block cAMP efflux.
F-cAMP-loaded U937 cells were screened against
compounds from the Prestwick Chemical Library (~1200
previously FDA-approved drugs) and the SPECTRUM
Collection (2320 compounds - 60% drugs, 25% natural
products, 15% bioactive components). The screen
identified 51 hits, which were tested in dose-response
to validate their activities (data not shown), yielding 7
potentially active ICE compounds: artemisinin, clioquinol,
quinalizarin, harmalol, cryptotanshinone, parthenolide,
and patulin. Three additional structurally-related
compounds (dihydroartemisinin, artemether, artesunate)
were also included for evaluation in secondary assays.
Based on further validation, only artesunate, clioquinol,

CREB/AFT-1 phosphorylation in response to ICE
Next, to evaluate whether reducing cAMP efflux
would result in an elevation of cytoplasmic cAMPdependent cell signaling, we studied the effects of ICE
on phosphorylation of cAMP-responsive element-binding
protein (CREB; Ser133) and activating transcription
factor-1 (ATF-1; Ser63), classical cAMP effectors that
activate target genes through cAMP response elements
(CRE). This pathway is also directly implicated in cAMPinduced apoptosis in leukemia [2]. All studied compounds
showed increased binding of anti-CREB (pS133) / ATF1 (pS63) specific antibodies as compared to vehicle
control (Figure 3). For two compounds (clioquinol and
parthenolide), the binding of antibodies was comparable
to the adenylate cyclase stimulator forskolin positive
control. Thus, ICE compounds can stimulate CREB/AFT1 phosphorylation.

VLA-4 deactivation in response to ICE
Another signaling pathway that in leukocytes
can be triggered by the elevation of cytoplasmic cyclic
nucleotides is the conformational deactivation of the
Very Late Antigen-4 (VLA-4, alpha4 beta1 integrin), an
adhesion molecule implicated in homing and retention
of early hematopoietic progenitors in the bone marrow.
The elevation of icAMP using G-alphaS GPCRspecific ligands, forskolin and by other pharmacological
manipulations results in rapid dissociation of the VLA4-specific ligand-mimicking probe, LDV-FITC [21]. We
studied the effect of ICE on VLA-4 deactivation using
the same previously characterized model system (Figure
4). Studied compounds triggered rapid dissociation of
LDV-FITC in U937 cells pre-activated through a non33962

three experiments is shown.

compounds or forskolin positive control (40 µM) or DMSO vehicle (third arrow). The use of the non-desensitizing mutant of FPR1 allows

the effects of parthenolide and patulin exceeded the
effects of the positive control, forskolin (Figure 4).
Cryptotanshinone induced rapid and reversible VLA-4
deactivation that looked similar to the effect of a cellpermeable cyclic nucleotide analog [22]. Thus, ICE
compounds were also capable of triggering an integrin
de-activation pathway, where the role of elevated cyclic
nucleotide concentration is critical [21, 22].

in the probe fluorescence was detected at 4oC, suggesting
that cell membrane integrity was well preserved and
passive probe leak had not occurred. This result suggests
that active cAMP removal cannot be detected in normal
PBMCs in the same time frame as in the AML model.

ICE induce apoptosis of U937 cells
The effect of ICE on U937 cell apoptosis after
overnight incubation has been studied using the
MultiCyt 4-Plex Apoptosis kit that reports four different
apoptosis endpoints: effector caspases 3 and 7 activation,
phosphatidylserine surface expression, mitochondrial
membrane depolarization and cell membrane integrity.
The ICE induced apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner,
and the EC50 values for all four apoptosis endpoints were
determined to range from 2-3 µM to several hundred
µM (Figure 7). The relative sensitivity of different
apoptosis endpoints reflected different consecutive steps
of the intrinsic pathway. Mitochondrial depolarization
and membrane damage were the most sensitive while the
effector caspase activation was the least. Cryptotanshinone
showed a very small effect on annexin-V binding and
caspase activation, even at the highest ICE concentrations.
These EC50s were excluded from further analyses (as
indicated by NC).
To simplify analysis, the data were color-coded
(heat map) according to the determined EC50 values
(Figure 7). The most potent compounds (EC50 values 1-10
µM) in the apoptosis assay were: patulin, parthenolide,
and dihydroartemisinin (white color). In addition, the
relative ranking was largely independent on the particular
endpoint. Mean EC50s calculated for each compound are
shown at the bottom of a heat map and indicate relative
potency of studied ICE. Thus, U937 cells treated with ICE
exhibited a dose-dependent increase in apoptosis.

Adenylyl cyclase inhibition reduces ICE-induced
cell viability loss
Because synthesis is a source for icAMP
accumulation, and soluble adenylyl cyclase (sAC) is
directly implicated in the mitochondrial pathway of
apoptosis, we studied how blocking the AC by the
selective sAC inhibitor, KH7, influences ICE effects.
Based on the data published by Kumar et al., 2009 [23],
we expected that blocking cAMP production would reduce
ICE potency (Figure 5A). In fact, we detected a significant
protective effect of KH7 on the cell viability loss induced
by the four most potent ICE compounds (Figure 5B). The
lack of effect for less potent ICE could be due to a lesser
effect on viability: KH7 displayed the most prominent
effect in samples where control viability was far below
50%. Thus, inhibition of sAC activity was sufficient to
reduce the effects of the most potent ICE.
Hence, compounds identified in an assay based
on blocking cAMP efflux can reduce cell viability, and
stimulate two signaling pathways that are each modulated
by elevation of icAMP, CREB phosphorylation and
VLA-4 deactivation. Moreover, blocking of sAC activity
prevented ICE-induced cell viability loss. These data are
consistent with an ICE molecular mechanism involving
elevation of icAMP. The accumulation of icAMP as the
result of decreased cAMP efflux in U937 cells was first
demonstrated by Copsel, et al. [19].

ICE decrease viability and show cancer cell
specificity

Normal primary peripheral blood mononuclear
cells (PBMCs) did not significantly efflux cAMP

Next, we tested the effect of ICE on the viability of
U937 cells and B-ALL cell lines (Table 2). On U937 cells,
several compounds were more potent than the positive
control MK-571 (Figure 8). In general, B-ALL cell lines
showed more sensitivity than the U937 cells to several of
the selected compounds. However, B-ALL lines showed a
decreased sensitivity to the two structurally related drugs:
artesunate and dihydroartemisinin. The EC50 values for the
ICE with each B-ALL line ranged from low nanomolar
to ~300 µM (Figure 8). It can be noted, however, that the
compounds, which consistently decreased viability ranked
in the same order across all six B-ALL lines: patulin,
parthenolide, clioquinol, cryptotanshinone.
To investigate the potential selectivity of the

According to our hypothesis, active cAMP efflux
represents a novel apoptosis evasion mechanism that
is activated in certain malignant cells, and normal
cells should lack this cAMP efflux ability. To test this
proposition, we compared F-cAMP efflux in U937 cells
and normal PBMCs (Figure 6). After 24 h incubation,
PBMCs loaded with F-cAMP retained ~80-90 % of the
probe fluorescence when incubated at 37 °C or at 4°C,
whereas U937 cells lost ~80 % of the probe fluorescence
only at 37 °C. A significant part of this loss was blocked by
incubation with efflux inhibitor MK-571, indicating active
participation of ABCC family transporters. No decrease

compounds, we compared ICE effects on cell viability in
leukemic and non-malignant cells (PBMCs from healthy
volunteers). The EC50 values indicated that for the most
potent of the tested compounds to be efficacious, PBMCs
required a concentration of at least an order of magnitude
higher than was necessary for the leukemic cell lines
(Figure 8, notice darker color-coding for PBMCs). This
difference was expected, since normal PBMCs do not
have an established system for cAMP efflux (Figure 6),
and therefore should be less sensitive to ICE.

at 4°C (passive leakage), the cells lost 20-60% of their
fluorescence from the initial F-cAMP loading. Incubation
at 37˚C (active efflux) resulted in F-cAMP removal that
ranged from ~60% to ~90%, with no apparent relationship
between 4°C and 37°C samples (Figure 9A). For example,
Nalm-6 and 697 cells showed dissimilar passive leakage,
but both cell lines exhibited similar active F-cAMP
removal abilities.
The cell lines also exhibited varied sensitivity to
MK-571, a control for transporter-dependent efflux. We
found a strong relationship between levels of F-cAMP
remaining in cells at 37°C, both alone and in the presence
of MK-571. Based on this parameter, cell lines could be
stratified into three groups, which indicated correlations
between ability to actively efflux cAMP and MK-571
inhibition of cAMP removal. Group 1: Sup-B15 and
MHH-Call3 removed ~60% of the F-cAMP by active
efflux, which was blocked completely by MK-571. Group

2: Reh and RS4;11 cells removed 75-80% of the F-cAMP
by active efflux, and ~30-40% with MK-571. Group 3:
697 and Nalm-6 cells removed > 90% of the F-cAMP
by active efflux, and 60-70% with MK-571 (Figure 9B).
Thus, the cell lines that effluxed F-cAMP poorly were
better inhibited by MK-571, and those that were efficient
in the removal of F-cAMP were less inhibited by MK571. This suggests that for cell lines in Groups 2 and 3, an
additional MK-571-insensitive mechanism participated in
the removal of F-cAMP.

To further establish the effectiveness of ICE in
reducing cancer cell viability, primary cells from six
B-ALL patients (Table 3) were tested ex vivo. The results
showed dose-dependent decreases in patient sample
viability after exposure to the compounds (Figure 11). To
verify the relative ranking of ICE, the mean EC50 values
for each compound were plotted against the mean EC50
values determined for all B-ALL cell lines. The result
indicated a strong correlation for most patient samples
(Figure 11B). This result suggests that the data obtained
using cell lines adequately reflect the relative compound
potency detected in patient samples, and therefore,
cell lines can be used to test ICE derivatives in future
medicinal chemistry applications.
Moreover, the overall shape of the dose-response
curves obtained for different patient samples revealed
an interesting pattern: the shape of the curves was more
patient-specific rather than compound-specific. For
example, in the samples from patients no. 1 and no.
5, we observed a significant increase in cell viability
vs. vehicle treated sample at lower concentrations of
dihydroartemisinin, clioquinol or parthenolide (see
points above the dashed line, Figure 11A). This behavior
was also evident in viability data from B-ALL cell lines
(Figure 8). These results are consistent with the report
that small or transient increases in icAMP can be antiapoptotic and therefore, can support cell survival [2, 3].
Under identical conditions, the same compounds elicited
no such effect in the samples obtained from patients no.

The primary cAMP transporter, MRP4/ABCC4,
is differentially expressed by leukemic cell lines
cAMP is primarily released by cells via the ABCC4
(MRP4) and ABCC5 (MRP5) transporters [24]. The
affinity of ABCC4 for cAMP is ~10-fold greater than
that of ABCC5 (km values of 44.5 µM and 379 µM,
respectively) [24, 25]. Therefore, we hypothesized that
the presence of ABCC4 on leukemic cells would correlate
with their ability to efflux F-cAMP. ABCC4 phenotypes
were determined for the B-ALL cell lines, and the number
of ABCC4-specific binding sites ranged from ~100 on
MHH-Call3 to ~104 on RS4;11 cells (Figure 10). However,
no apparent correlation between ABCC4 expression and
F-cAMP efflux were detected (compare Figure 9 and
Figure 10). This suggests that other transporters and/or
mechanisms may play additional roles in leukemic cell
removal of cAMP.

DISCUSSION

slopes of the dose-response curves are analyzed. It appears
that in some patient samples, the slopes are steeper than in
others. These data suggest that certain traits of a particular
patient sample play a significant role in the response to
different ICE compounds. It might be useful to correlate
genotypic and phenotypic profiles of patient samples with
these dose-response curve parameters. However, this will
require further studies with larger numbers of patient
samples with diverse genotypic and phenotypic profiles.

For many years, researchers have been eager to
develop methods to robustly modulate icAMP in cancer
cells, and all known steps of the cAMP-related signaling
pathway have been targeted [6]. Only recently, researchers
have realized that icAMP can be also modulated by cyclic
nucleotide efflux transporters. The finding that blocking
cAMP efflux or down-regulation of efflux transporters
can trigger cAMP elevation and downstream signaling

[19] has opened new avenues for developing a novel class
of anticancer therapeutics via inhibitors of cAMP efflux.
Analysis of the proteins capable of cyclic nucleotide efflux
also suggests notable possibilities.
The cAMP transporter ABCC4 has increased
expression in blood cancer cells as compared to normal
hematopoietic cells [26], and its expression decreases
significantly upon cell differentiation [27]. ABC
transporters are likewise upregulated in stem-like cells,
which may suggest that these cells require active removal
of cAMP or other structurally-related compounds in order
to remain in a pluripotent state, and that the metabolic
specificity of these cells requires active transport of
certain metabolites [28]. These cancer stem cells are
also associated with higher resistance to typical cancer
therapeutics [29]. However, our results for ABCC4expression did not define any clear correlations between
cAMP efflux and ABCC4 expression in the cell lines. It
is possible that other transporters capable of cAMP efflux
(ABCC5 or ABCC11 [25, 30]) are present, or that there is
a difference in the efflux capacity of different transporters.
This may indicate that the ability to inhibit cAMP transport
is substrate- or condition-dependent.

Of the active compounds identified in our screen
for ICE, the majority were sesquiterpene lactones:
parthenolide is derived from the feverfew (Tanacetum
parthenium) plant; artemisinin and dihydroartemisinin are
from Artemisia annua; and artesunate and artemether are
semi-synthetic artemisinin derivatives. Cryptotanshinone
is also plant-derived (Salvia miotiorrhiza), whereas
clioquinol is an antimicrobial hydroxyquinolone
derivative, and patulin is an antibiotic mycotoxin produced
by Aspergillus and Penicillium. These compounds have
been reported to exhibit anticancer activity in a number
of model systems (Table 4), and the reported anticancer
effects of these compounds were often similar to those
seen in our assays (Table 5). However, none of the
compounds has previously been reported to modulate
cyclic nucleotide efflux.
Artemisinin, dihydroartemisinin, artesunate and
artemether are currently used worldwide for the treatment
of malaria. Artemether is a component of the drug Coartem
manufactured by Novartis and approved by the US Food
and Drug Administration in 2009. Several ongoing clinical
trials of artemisinin derivatives to treat hepatocellular
carcinoma, breast cancer, cervical intraepithelial

neoplasia, as well as a trial evaluating “biological activity
of oral clioquinol in patients with relapsed or refractory
hematological malignancy” initiated by Dr. Mark Minden
from Ontario Cancer Institute Princess Margaret Hospital
in Canada, can be found on clinicaltrials.gov. Therefore,
these drugs have the highest potential to be repurposed
into current treatment regimens. Poor water-solubility
and bioavailability of parthenolide prompted medical
chemistry efforts to improve these characteristics [31].
However, since these drugs were identified from two
relatively small libraries totaling ~3500 compounds, we
envision that larger efforts to identify compounds capable
of blocking cAMP efflux may lead to better drugs. This is
especially important because of the unique signaling role

of cAMP in apoptosis.
As a messenger, cAMP plays significant regulatory
roles within cells. Multiple signaling mechanisms critical
for leukemogenesis can be down-modulated by cAMP. At
least two cAMP/PKA-related pathways can be involved
in the induction of cAMP-dependent apoptosis in cancer
cells: 1) the mitochondrial-mediated (intrinsic) pathway,
and 2) modulation of the NF-κB signaling pathway
(Figure 12). The pro-apoptotic intrinsic mechanism
promoted by cAMP depends upon PKA [17], which can
phosphorylate CREB, and results in transcription of the
apoptotic activator Bim/BCL2L11 [2]. cAMP modulation
of NF-κB can affect transcription of pro-survival genes
[32]. Our data suggest that inhibition of cAMP transport

Figure 12: Mechanisms for cAMP-dependent regulation of cell death. cAMP is produced by various pools of soluble and

membrane-bound adenylyl cyclases (sAC and AC). Blocking cAMP efflux with ICE (1) triggers several signaling endpoints that are related
to the modulation of pro-apoptotic and cell survival pathways. Here, we detected phosphorylation of CREB/ATF-1 (2), mitochondrial
depolarization (3), effector caspases 3 and 7 activation (4), and apoptosis (5) in the form of annexin-V binding and cell membrane
damage. Blocking adenylyl cyclase activity using selective inhibitor of soluble adenylyl cyclase (KH7) was sufficient to reduce effects
of most potent compounds. Various molecular mechanisms are implicated in effects of cAMP on apoptosis induction. In AML cells
pro-apoptotic protein Bim/BCL2L11 expression is up-regulated via CRE/CREB in a cAMP-dependent manner [2]. Induction of Bim
represents a crucial event in the cAMP-induced apoptosis in murine T-cell lymphoma and human acute leukemia [9]. cAMP is also shown
to inhibit MCL-1 protein transcription in human MM cells [8] or human B-precursor cells [18]. Relocalization of the cytosolic sAC pool
toward mitochondria leads to PKA activation and phosphorylation of the pro-apoptotic protein Bax that activates mitochondrial apoptotic
pathway [44]. Also, cAMP is implicated in a regulation of NF-κB action [32], which is a potential target in AML [45].

synthesized at AIBioTech. The selective inhibitor of
soluble adenylyl cyclase, KH7, was purchased from
Cayman Chemical Company (cat. 330676-02-3). All other
reagents and hit compounds for secondary assays were
from Sigma-Aldrich.
Cell lines, purchased from ATCC and DSMZ, were
cultured in RPMI-1640 medium supplemented with 2 mM
L-glutamine, 100 U/ml penicillin-streptomycin and 10%
heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS; 20% for MHHCall3), hereafter referred to as cRPMI, and incubated in a
humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2 at 37°C.

by ICE was able to elicit many of these effects.
Targeting cancer through a “pathway-dependent
approach” that consists of different means of elevating
cAMP is considered a viable option for novel therapeutic
development [6]. It appears that every potential step of
the pathway, including cAMP synthesis, degradation, and
downstream signaling, has been taken into consideration
to stimulate icAMP accumulation [6, 33, 34]. Classically,
cyclic nucleotide analogs or other cAMP-elevating agents
have been used to treat hematological malignancies by
slowing cell growth and differentiating cancer cells [14].
However, while modestly effective, these compounds
exhibit toxicity in non-cancerous tissues [35-37]. Our data
suggest that targeting cAMP efflux with small molecules
could be an efficient way to raise icAMP in certain types of
cancer, and this could potentially result in the development
of a new class of pathway-specific therapeutics. Because
increased cAMP efflux is not a typical trait of healthy cells,
the identified ICE exhibited specificity toward leukemic
cells. The relatively efficient targeting of cAMP transport
in cancers would directly depend on cell- or patientspecific characteristics and efflux ability. We anticipate
that identification of drugs that inhibit this transport could
allow for selective targeting of cancers that capitalize on
cAMP pathway modulation for survival, and this merits
further investigation into the effects of ICE on multiple
ABC transporters. The fact that the machinery responsible
for apoptotic evasion by cAMP efflux can also potentially
support the removal of structurally related chemotherapy
drugs (e.g., ara-C), and thus may contribute to multidrug
resistance [38-40], makes this work unusually promising.

PBMCs
Healthy PBMCs were obtained from volunteers.
Mononuclear cells were purified using Mono-Poly
resolving medium (MP Biomedicals, cat. 091698049)
according to manufacturer’s instructions. PBMCs were
resuspended in cRPMI and kept on ice prior to use.

Primary ALL patient samples
Bone marrow samples were acquired at diagnosis
from pediatric B-ALL patients. Mononuclear cells
were enriched by centrifugation in Ficoll-Paque (GE
Healthcare, cat. 17-1440-02) and aliquoted for storage
in liquid nitrogen until use. Samples were thawed in a
37°C water bath, resuspended in 20% FBS cRPMI, and
centrifuged to remove freezing medium. Cells were
resuspended in conditioned medium (DMEM, 10% FBS,
50 U/ml penicillin-streptomycin, 2 mM L-glutamine) from
HS-5 stromal cell cultures.

Cells were loaded with F-cAMP as described [41].
Briefly, cells were resuspended in a hypertonic solution
containing 10% polyethylene glycol 1000, 0.5 M sucrose,
and 250 µM F-cAMP in cRPMI without FBS, incubated 10
min at room temperature, washed, and then resuspended

2 min at room temperature to complete F-cAMP loading.
Cells were resuspended in cRPMI and equilibrated for 2 h
under normal culture conditions.
For testing cAMP efflux, an aliquot of loaded cells
was kept at 4°C to serve as control, and the remaining cells
were incubated in the presence of vehicle or compounds
overnight. Samples were evaluated using Accuri C6 or BD
FACScan flow cytometers (Becton Dickinson (BD)).

CA, USA) and/or Biotek Multiflo system (Winooski,
VT, USA). F-cAMP-loaded U937 cells (2000/well) were
seeded into 384-well polypropylene plates (Greiner BioOne 784201, Monroe, NC, USA). Cells were treated
with compounds (10 µM final concentration) from
the Prestwick Chemical Library (Illkirch, France) or
SPECTRUM Collection (MicroSource, Gaylordsville,
CT, USA) delivered by pintool (V&P Scientific, San
Diego, CA), at a final DMSO concentration of 1%.
Plates were foil-sealed with AlumaSeal 384™ (Excel
Scientific, Victorville, CA, USA), and incubated inverted
overnight. Sample plates were analyzed by CyAn flow
cytometers (Beckman-Coulter) configured with HyperCyt
high-throughput auto-sampler systems (IntelliCyt,
Albuquerque, NM, USA) using 488 nm excitation to
assess FL-1 (530/40) MFI levels.
Data were analyzed with HyperView software
(IntelliCyt) and time-gated to determine data from each
well. Wells with ≥ 50 events were evaluated for FL-1 MFI
values. Samples with MFI values ≥ 2 standard deviations
above the plate mean negative control values were
considered “hit” compounds.

Kinetic analysis of VLA-4 deactivation
Kinetic analysis of the binding and dissociation
of the LDV-FITC probe was described previously [42].
Briefly, flow cytometric data were acquired at 37°C while
the samples were stirred continuously with a stir bar (BelArt Products). First, U937 cells transfected with a nondesensitizing mutant of the Formyl Peptide Receptor FPR1
[43] were analyzed for 30-120 s to establish a baseline. The
FPR1 mutant triggers VLA-4 activation, which persists for
hundreds of seconds, allowing for integrin deactivation
to be detected. Next, the LDV-FITC was added and
acquisition was re-established. For cell activation, the
high affinity FPR-specific agonist (N-formyl-L-methionylL-leucyl-L-phenylalanyl-L-phenylalanine,
fMLFF)
was added at a saturating concentration (100 nM), and
acquisition was re-established. Finally, 40 µM of ICE,
forskolin (positive control) or vehicle (negative control)
were added. Acquisition was re-established, and data were
acquired continuously for up to 1024 s.
The concentration of the LDV-FITC probe used
in deactivation experiments (4 nM) was below the
dissociation constant (Kd) for its binding to resting VLA4 (low affinity state, Kd ~12 nM), and above the Kd for
physiologically activated VLA-4 (high affinity state, Kd
~1-2 nM). Therefore, the transition from low to high
affinity state led to increased binding of the probe. This
was detected as an increase in the median fluorescence
intensity (MFI). VLA-4 deactivation led to the dissociation
of the probe and decreased MFI [21].

Compound validation
To validate sample data and decrease the number
of false-positive hits, compounds were assayed in a
high-throughput dose response assay. Plates were set up
as in the HTS, with the exception that the plate formats
contained 10-well dose responses for each hit compound,
at final concentrations ranging from 30 µM to 4 nM.
For B-ALL cell lines, tests of hit compound
inhibition of cAMP efflux were conducted as in the HTS,
with compounds in 10-well dose responses ranging from
100 µM - 1.53 nM, at cell densities of 5000/well.
The dose response data were normalized for percent
response based on sample FL-1 MFI values in comparison
to untreated F-cAMP-loaded cells kept at 4°C overnight or
at time = 0, and were fitted by GraphPad Prism 5 software
(GraphPad Software, La Jolla, CA, USA) for sigmoidal
dose response with constrained hill slope = 1. Compounds
with S-shaped dose response curves and EC50 values less
than 3 μM were selected for secondary assays.

Viability
Cell viability was determined with the CellTiterGlo® Luminescent Cell Viability Assay (Promega). Greiner
655083 had 100 µL cRPMI +/- 4x104 cells/well, and dose
response curves of compounds ranged from 100 µM to
1.53 nM (1% DMSO). Wells with DMSO-only served as
negative controls. Samples were incubated overnight, and
the assay was completed according to the manufacturer’s
protocol. Plates were analyzed using a Victor3V™ 1420
Multilabel Counter (Perkin Elmer).
For primary ALL patient samples, media consisted
of 50% cRPMI, 50% conditioned DMEM from HS-5
stromal cell cultures and compounds. Cell densities ranged
from 28,000-68,000 cells/well, and plates were foil-sealed
prior to incubation.

Detection of CREB/AFT-1 phosphorylation in
response to ICE
Cells were suspended at 106 cells/ml in cRPMI and
incubated for 1 hour at 37oC with 20 µM ICE compounds
or forskolin (positive control). Negative control samples
were treated with DMSO at equal volume. Cells were
fixed with 20x volume of pre-warmed 1x solution BD
PhosflowTM Lyse/Fix Buffer (cat. 558049), incubated at
37°C for 10 minutes, permeabilized with BD PhosflowTM

samples were analyzed for FL-1 MFI. The calibration
beads were used to generate a linear regression, which
associated MFI to the antibody-binding capacity of the
beads. This regression was used to calculate the number
of antibody binding sites (ABS) per cell sample. For each
cell type, the calculated ABS for isotype control samples
were subtracted from ABS of the ABCC4 samples to
determine specific binding sites.

Cells treated with ICE and control samples were
incubated with 1 µg/ml of 7-AAD for 20-60 minutes
at 4°C on a rotator in the dark, and analyzed by flow
cytometry according to manufacturer instructions. Gates
were set on 7-AAD negative and positive events based on
histograms. Percent of 7-AAD negative events is shown.

Data analysis

Apoptosis

The kinetic data were converted to MFI versus
time using FCSQuery software developed by Dr. Bruce
Edwards (University of New Mexico). Analysis of
apoptosis was done using ForeCyt software (IntelliCyt).
Curve fits and statistics were done using GraphPad Prism
software version 5.01 (GraphPad Software), as described
in figure captions.

Apoptosis was determined using MultiCyt®
4-Plex Apoptosis Screening Kit (IntelliCyt, cat. 90053).
The kit provides four different apoptosis endpoints
that include effector caspases 3 and 7 activation,
phosphatidylserine surface expression, mitochondrial
membrane depolarization and cell membrane integrity.
The activation of caspases is detected using NucView™
488 Caspase3/7-specific substrate that exhibits increase
in fluorescence upon cleavage by activated enzyme.
Surface phosphatidylserine is detected by the binding of
labelled annexin-V. Another fluorescent dye accumulates
in intact mitochondria and upon mitochondrial membrane
depolarization it leaks into the cytoplasm and exhibits
a decrease in fluorescence. Cell membrane damage is
detected by the uptake of a proprietary DNA intercalating
agent analogous to 7-aminoactinomycin D.
384-well plates (Greiner 784201), pre-loaded with
5 µL cRPMI were stamped using a pintool with 100 nl
of DMSO-solubilized compounds from the 100-fold
concentrated stock solution. Next, 5 µL U937 cells (2 x
106/ml in cRPMI) were added to wells and mixed, and
plates were foil-sealed. Compounds (Table 1) were tested
in dose response at final concentrations ranging from
15.2 nM to 100 µM (1% DMSO final). Vehicle (DMSO)
was used as a negative control. After 24 h incubation
under culture conditions, the IntelliCyt MultiCyt
4-Plex Apoptosis Screening Kit was used according
to manufacturer’s protocol. The data were acquired
using iQue Screener Platform (IntelliCyt). Singlet cell
populations were analyzed for individual measures of
apoptosis, and gates were set based on control histograms.
