BACKGROUND. Therapy targeted against the vascular endothelial growth factor
(VEGF) pathway is a standard of care for patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma (RCC). The identification of patients who are more likely to benefit from
these agents is warranted.

METHODS. In total, 120 patients with metastatic clear-cell RCC received bevacizumab, sorafenib, sunitinib, or axitinib on 1 of 9 prospective clinical trials at the
Cleveland Clinic. Clinical features associated with outcome were identified by
univariate analysis; then, a stepwise modeling approach based on Cox proportional hazards regression was used to identify independent prognostic factors
and to form a model for progression-free survival (PFS). A bootstrap algorithm
was used to provide internal validation.

RESULTS. The overall median PFS was 13.8 months, and the objective response
according to the Response Criteria in Solid Tumors was 34%. Multivariate analysis identified time from diagnosis to current treatment \2 years; baseline platelet
and neutrophil counts [300 K/lL and [4.5 K/lL, respectively; baseline corrected
serum calcium \8.5 mg/dL or [10 mg/dL; and initial Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status [0 as independent, adverse prognostic factors
(PF) for PFS. Three prognostic subgroups were formed based on the number of
adverse prognostic factors present. The median PFS in patients with 0 or 1
adverse prognostic factor was 20.1 months compared with 13 months in patients
with 2 adverse prognostic factors and 3.9 months in patients with [2 adverse
prognostic factors.

CONCLUSIONS. Five independent prognostic factors for predicting PFS were identified and were used to categorize patients with metastatic RCC who received
VEGF-targeted therapies into 3 risk groups. These prognostic factors can be
incorporated into patient care and clinical trials that use such novel, VEGF-targeted agents. Cancer 2007;110:543–50.  2007 American Cancer Society.

enal cell carcinoma (RCC) is the tenth most common cancer in
the U.S., accounting for [38,000 new diagnoses and [12,800
deaths annually.1 Epidemiologic studies suggest a continued rise in
RCC incidence in the U.S.2 Although most patients with early-stage
RCC can be cured surgically, approximately 33% of patients present

tive.3 In addition, approximately 50% of patients who
undergo potentially curative surgery for less advanced disease can be expected to develop a recurrence with distant metastases.4 Five-year survival for
patients with de novo metastatic or recurrent disease
ranges between 0% and 20%.3,5
Many authors have identified clinical factors that
are associated with outcome in patients with metastatic RCC when they are treated with cytokines
(interferon, and interleukin), chemotherapy, or a variety of historic therapies. These schemas included tumor-, patient-, and disease-related factors, such as
performance status (PS), time from diagnosis to therapy, number of metastatic sites, visceral metastasis,
hemoglobin, calcium, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH),
inflammation markers, and others. Prognostic models have been derived from these factors and have
greatly improved patient prognostication and counseling.6–15
Recent advances in the understanding of the
biology of clear-cell RCC have established the importance of an inactivated von Hippel-Lindau
(VHL) gene and its role in the pathogenesis of sporadic clear-cell RCC. VHL gene alterations lead to
increased levels of hypoxia-induced factor a (HIFa)
and subsequent activation of several of the hypoxia-regulated genes.16,17 The overexpression of
vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and
other growth factors results in endothelial cell migration, tumor growth, and tumor angiogenesis.18,19
Consequently, VEGF inhibition has become an
attractive therapeutic target in patients with metastatic RCC.20 The inhibition of this pathway with
agents such as bevacizumab,21 sunitinib,22,23 and
sorafenib,24 has demonstrated significant antitumor
activity in advanced RCC.
Although these trials have enrolled patients
and/or have reported results according to existing
classification schemas, such schemas have been
developed from patients who were treated with
cytokines and/or chemotherapy, and it is unclear
whether the same factors reported previously are
relevant to patients who are treated with VEGF-targeted therapy. Because the vast majority of patients
who have advanced RCC currently are receiving
anti-VEGF therapy, the identification of relevant
clinical factors in the anti-VEGF era is warranted.
In the current study, clinical factors that were associated with outcome in a cohort of patients with
clear-cell RCC who were receiving anti-VEGF agents
were identified, and a prognostic model was constructed using progression-free survival (PFS) as an
endpoint.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients
We reviewed the records of patients with metastatic
RCC who were treated with anti-VEGF agents (bevacizumab, sunitinib, sorafenib, and axitinib [AG013736]) and who were enrolled onto Institutional
Review Board-approved clinical trials at the Cleveland Clinic Taussig Cancer Center between October
2003 and January 2006. The trials were composed of
3 phase 2 trials, 2 phase 3 trials, 2 randomized phase
2 trials, and 2 compassionate use studies. The 3
phase 2 trials included patients who were treated
with sunitinib,22 axitinib,25 and bevacizumab in combination with interleukin-2 (unpublished data). The 2
phase 3 trials included a randomized study of sunitinib versus interferon-a as first-line therapy23 and
randomized study of sorafenib versus placebo in
cytokine-refractory patients.24 The 2 randomized
phase 2 studies included bevacizumab with or without erlotinib26 and sorafenib versus interferon-a,27
both as first-line therapy. Finally, 2 compassionate
use studies included patients who were treated with
either sorafenib or sunitinib as part of 2 extendedaccess programs. Eligibility criteria for the trials were
fairly uniform and generally included the following:
histologic documentation of RCC; clinical or biopsy
evidence of metastatic disease; clear-cell component;
measurable disease; an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) PS of 0 or 1; adequate renal, hepatic, and bone marrow function; absent or
previously treated central nervous system metastasis;
no prior history of cancer (except basal cell carcinoma or carcinoma in situ of the cervix); absence of
significant cardiac disease; and no recent surgery.
Data collected included standard pretreatment
patient and disease characteristics, baseline biochemical parameters, first date of treatment, best
response to treatment, date of progression according
to Response Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria,28 date of death or last follow-up, and other factors previously reported as prognostic for survival in
patients with metastatic RCC (Table 1). C-reactive
protein data were not collected, because this information was not available for most patients. The Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC)10 and
Cleveland Clinic Foundation (CCF)14 risk groups
were applied to these data to investigate the applicability of these 2 models in patients with RCC
who received VEGF-targeted therapy. An objective
response was defined by RECIST criteria for all
patients.28 Overall survival was defined as the time
from initiation of treatment to the date of death or
last follow-up. PFS was defined from the initiation of

Statistical Analyses
PFS distributions were estimated using the KaplanMeier method.29 The correlations between survival
and the individual factors listed in Table 1 were analyzed using the log-rank test30 and the Cox proportional-hazards model.31 Clinical and pathologic
characteristics that, by nature, are categorical, such
as sex, and PS were analyzed using the log-rank test.
Biochemical parameters and other characteristics
that are measured on a continuum, such as age and
time from diagnosis to study entry, were analyzed as
continuous variables using the Cox proportionalhazards model and as categoric variables using the
log-rank test. The cut-off points used for categorizations were based on previously described cut-off
points in the literature and/or recursive partitioning.
The Cox proportional-hazards model with step-wise
variable selection was used to assess multiple factors
simultaneously. A significance level of .05 was used
as the criterion for determining variable entry and
removal from the model. For convenience only, the
categoric forms of continuous variables were included in the multivariable analyses. The proportionality assumption was assessed graphically using log
(2log) plots and quantitatively using the Z-statistic
proposed by Harrell.32 All tests of statistical significance were 2-sided. All data analyses were conducted

using SAS statistical analysis software (version 8; SAS
Inc., Raleigh, NC). Once a final model was determined, internal validation was performed using a
bootstrap procedure in which samples of 120
patients in size were generated randomly (with replacement) from the original study population (also
n 5 120 patients) and analyzed using the stepwise
logistic regression procedure described above. Five
hundred such samples were generated and analyzed,
and the frequency of each factor’s inclusion in the
resulting models was calculated. Factors that were
present in 50% of the models were considered significant and were used to build a final ‘‘bootstrapbased’’ model.

RESULTS
Patient Characteristics
One hundred thirty patients who had no prior history of treatment with anti-VEGF therapies who were
enrolled onto Institutional Review Board-approved
clinical trials between October 2003 and January
2006 were identified. Excluding patients with incomplete key data (n 5 2), patients who were treated on
more than 1 clinical trial (n 5 1), and patients with
pure nonclear-cell histology (n 5 7), in total, 120
patients were available for the current analysis. Table 2 lists the distribution of anti-VEGF agents used
by the cohort of patients. The majority of patients
(101 of 120 patients; 84%) were treated with either
sorafenib or sunitinib. Forty-five patients (37%)
received anti-VEGF therapy as their first-line treatment compared with 75 patients (63%) who received
previous nonanti-VEGF therapies. Seventy-one percent of patients were men, and 46% were aged [60
years. All patients had undergone prior nephrectomy,
which, in general, was an eligibility criterion for participation in these clinical trials. The majority of
patients had an ECOG PS of 0, and only 7% of
patients had central nervous system metastases.

ing for 39% of patients, grade was not included in
the multivariate analysis. Similarly, PFS was unaffected by prior systemic therapy (14.7 months vs
13.8 months for untreated vs previously treated
patients, respectively; P 5 .79), suggesting that exposure cytokines or chemotherapy does not have an
impact on subsequent response to VEGF-targeted
therapy (Fig. 2).

FIGURE 1. Overall progression-free survival.

Although an attempt was made to capture the nuclear grade of the primary tumor, complete information was not available on 39% of patients. Missing
grade was attributed mostly to the unavailability of
the original specimen for review (eg, surgery or biopsy done at an outside hospital, specimens [15
years since nephrectomy) or to the fact that some
specimens were obtained by cytologic aspiration.

Patient Outcomes
Overall, 34% of patients achieved an objective
response according to investigator-assessed RECIST
criteria (3 complete responses and 38 partial responses). Thirty-one percent of previously untreated
patients achieved a response (partial or complete)
compared with 36% of previously treated patients
(P 5 .69). Sixty-two patients (52%) have developed
disease progression, and 17 patients (14%) have died.
The overall estimated PFS is 13.8 months (95% confidence interval [95% CI], 10.7–19.0 months) (Fig. 1).
The median follow-up for the 58 patients who
remain progression free is 10.9 months (range, 4.1–32
months).
Univariate Analysis of Risks Factors for PFS
A number of clinical and laboratory variables were
associated with a worse PFS on univariate analysis,
as shown in Table 3. In addition, the MSKCC and
CCF models (comparing favorable-risk vs intermediate-risk vs unfavorable-risk groups) proposed for
previously untreated and treated patients, respectively, also were prognostic for PFS on univariate
analysis. Nuclear grade did not appear to have an
impact on PFS; however, it did have borderline significance. Because data for nuclear grade were miss-

Multivariate Analysis of Risks Factors for PFS
Although many factors were associated individually
with PFS on univariate analysis, only 6 factors were
identified as independent predictors of a poor outcome on subsequent multivariate analysis. With the
least favorable feature listed first, the following factors were identified: ECOG PS (1 vs 0), time from
diagnosis to current treatment (\2 years vs 2
years), abnormal baseline corrected serum calcium
(\8.5 mg/dL or [10 mg/dL vs 8.5–10 mg/dL), high
platelet count ([300 K/lL vs 300 K/lL), higher
absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ([4.5 K/lL vs 4.5
K/lL), and lower absolute lymphocyte count ([1.5
K/lL vs 1.5 K/lL). However, during internal validation using a bootstrap algorithm, lymphocyte count
came into a fairly small number of models (38%)
and, thus, was dropped from the final model (Table 4). It is noteworthy that neither the MSKCC risk
score nor the CCF risk score was associated with PFS
when it was considered in multivariate analysis.

Derivation of a Prognostic Model
Based on the magnitude of the parameter estimates
and the observation that their variances were similar,
it is convenient to combine these factors into a simple scoring system. By counting the number of unfavorable characteristics present (1 ‘‘point’’ for each
adverse prognostic factor, except for corrected serum
calcium \8.5 mg/dL or [10 mg/dL, which counts as
2 ‘‘points’’ because, according to Table 4, the magnitude of the associated regression coefficient is
approximately twice that of the other parameters), 3
distinct prognostic groups were identified. Patients
with 0 or 1 adverse prognostic factors (63 patients;
53%) have a median PFS of 20.1 months (95% CI,
19–22.3 months) and are considered a favorable-risk
group. Patients with 2 adverse prognostic factors (27
patients; 23%) have a median PFS of 13 months (95%
CI, 8.6–17.6 months) and are considered an intermediate-risk group. Finally, patients with [2 adverse
prognostic factors (30 patients; 25%) have a dismal
PFS of 3.9 months (95% CI, 1.8–7.2 months) and are
considered a poor-risk group (Table 5, Fig. 3).

DISCUSSION
Advances in the treatment of patients with metastatic
RCC and the introduction of novel agents targeting
the VEGF pathway make it necessary to identify the
contemporary clinical, laboratory, and molecular features that can be used to predict outcome. The current results demonstrate that prognostic factors and
models that were described previously and that often
are used prior to the availability of novel agents may
not be entirely applicable to patients with advanced
RCC who are starting VEGF therapy. This is important, especially because clinical trials evaluating
these novel compounds have stratified patients using
outdated models from the cytokine era. The suggested model has grouped patients into 3 risk groups
based on 5 readily available clinical prognostic variables. These can be incorporated readily into clinical
patient care and into stratification schema for future
clinical trials of these novel agents.
It is noteworthy that the median PFS of 13
months in patients with metastatic RCC who rec-

eived the VEGF-targeting agents was considerably
superior to that reported in prior series involving earlier therapies. This finding is supported by clinical
trials, which have indicated improved PFS with sunitinib, sorafenib, bevacizumab, and axitinib in
patients with advanced RCC.21,23–25 The absolute
value of PFS, however, must be interpreted in light of
the select group of patients with metastatic RCC who
are fit enough to participate in clinical trials at a specialized tertiary referral center for RCC.
Another finding of interest was the statistically
similar PFS of patients who received front-line
VEGF-targeted therapy for metastatic disease compared with patients who received VEGF-targeted
therapy as second-line treatment. This finding supports the hypothesis that the biology of RCC that
mediates response to VEGF-targeted therapy perhaps
may not be impacted adversely by prior exposure to
cytokine therapy.
In the current study, we identified additional
prognostic factors in patients with metastatic RCC,
such as high platelet and neutrophil counts. These

Clinical Factors in Metastatic RCC/Choueiri et al.

2 factors may be considered ‘‘inflammation markers.’’
Recently, it was demonstrated that thrombocytosis
was an independent, poor PF in a retrospective study
of 700 patients with metastatic RCC.33 Patients who
had elevated platelet counts had significantly shorter
survival than patients ho had normal platelet counts
(median survival, 8.4 months and 14.6 months, respectively; P <.001). The exact mechanism of thrombocytosis in association with RCC is unclear, although
this may be a reflection of an overproduction of
interleukins and other growth factors by the tumor.34
In turn, platelet overproduction can enhance the adherence and penetration of malignant cells through
the endothelial wall,35 and platelet granules contain
a variety of angiogenic factors, such as VEGF, platelet-derived growth factor, transforming growth factor
b, and others that have been implicated in various
steps of tumor progression.36,37
Similarly, increased an ANC was cited as an independent adverse risk factor in 2 metastatic RCC
prognostic models for patients who received treatment with cytokine-based regimens.12,13 Recently,
immunologic variables derived from blood (ANC)
and tumor analyses (intratumoral neutrophils and
CD57-positive natural killer cell counts) added significantly to prognostic models that were based on clinical risk factors only in patients who were treated
with interleukin-2-based regimens.38 Therefore, the
status of the immune system may exert a critical role
in the response to cytokine-based therapy. In the
current study, we observed that immune parameters
such as ANC continued to play an important role in
patient prognostication despite the presumed mechanism of action of VEGF-targeted agents. This finding supports other data demonstrating a potential
immunomodulatory effect of sunitinib in promoting
an immunostimulatory T-helper 1 bias and reducing
immunosuppressive T-regulatory cells.39 Further investigation of a potential immunostimulatory mechanism of VEGF-targeted agents is warranted.
This study had many limitations. First, patients
were treated with different VEGF-targeted agents,
and the relevance and application of our factors and
model may not be considered equal for all agents.
Alternatively, a heterogeneous group of anti-VEGF
agents may make these results more generalizable
for this class of agents in metastatic RCC. The implications and findings of our study will require external validation before they can have widespread
application. This study did not address or investigate
the prognostic value of molecular markers for this
disease, specifically, whether mutation or methylation of the VHL gene has prognostic implications. A
recent retrospective study suggested that the time to

549

progression on VEGF-targeted therapy may be prolonged in patients with VHL methylation or mutations that truncate or shift the VHL reading frame.40
The VHL status of tumor tissue from the current
cohort of patients is being analyzed to incorporate
these results into our proposed model. Prospective
investigation of clinical and molecular features in a
large number of patients with RCC will be required.
In summary, the current analyses identified 5
readily available clinical parameters that can classify
patients with metastatic RCC into 3 risk groups with
variable outcomes after they receive treatment with
VEGF-targeting agents. Further validation of this
model will help to identify which patients are most
likely to respond to such therapy and will allow the
appropriate application of treatment to those
patients who are most likely to benefit.
