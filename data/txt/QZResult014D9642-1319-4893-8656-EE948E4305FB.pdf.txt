ABSTRACT:
Purpose: Patients with advanced cholangiocarcinoma (CC) and gallbladder
carcinoma (GC) have few therapeutic options for relapsed disease.
Methods: Given the overall poor prognosis in this population and the availability
of novel targeted therapies, we systematically analyzed the characteristics and
outcomes for GC and CC patients treated on phase I trials with an emphasis on
targeted agents and locoregional therapies.
Results: Of 40 treated patients (GC=6; CC=34; median age, 60 years), 8 (20%)
had stable disease (SD) > 6 months, 3 (8%) partial response (PR), on protocols with
hepatic arterial drug infusion and anti-angiogenic, anti-HER-2/neu or novel MAPK/
ERK kinase (MEK) inhibitors. Median progression-free survival (PFS) on phase I trials
was 2.0 months (95% CI 1.7, 2.8) versus 3.0 months (95% CI 2.4, 5.0), 3.0 months
(95% CI 2.3, 4.6), and 3.0 months (95% CI 2.4, 3.9) for their first-, second-, and
last-line FDA-approved therapy. In univariate analysis, >3 metastatic sites, elevated
alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (>56IU/L), serum creatinine (>1.6mg/dL), and
CA19-9 (>35U/mL) were associated with a shorter PFS. Mutational analysis revealed
mutation in the KRAS oncogene in 2 of 11 patients (18%). The SD >6 months/PR
rate of 28% was seen with hepatic arterial infusion of oxaliplatin, and inhibitors of
angiogenesis, HER-2/neu or MEK.
Conclusions: The PFS in phase I trials was similar to that of the first, second,
and last-line therapy (P=0.95, 0.98, 0.76, respectively) with FDA-approved agents
given in the advanced setting, emphasizing a role for targeted agents in a clinical
trials setting as potentially valuable therapeutic options for these patients.

INTRODUCTION

arising from the epithelium of the gallbladder and hepatic
bile ducts, respectively.[1] CC is further stratified by
anatomic location, either intrahepatic or extrahepatic.
CC and GC are challenging diseases to diagnose given
their insidious evolution and lack of effective screening
modalities. With few cases (<10%) presenting as early
disease, most patients are initially diagnosed with

Cholangiocarcinoma (CC) and gallbladder
carcinoma (GC) are rare, but aggressive, biliary tract
malignancies characterized by their advanced stage at
diagnosis and high mortality. Though anatomically
neighbors, GC and CC are histologically distinct entities

epidemiological trends point towards an increasing
incidence and prevalence of CC and GC in East Asia,
Latin America and in western societies, particularly given
their association with hepatitis C infection, chronic nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and obesity.[5, 6] Current
Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved agents
used in unresectable CC and GC include gemcitabine,
capecitabine, cisplatin, oxaliplatin, fluoropyrimidines,
including 5-fluorouracil, or a combination of these agents,
although none are FDA approved primarily for use in
biliary tract cancers. [7, 8] Recent protocols combine
chemotherapy with radiation either in the preoperative
neoadjuvant setting or in the postoperative setting. Even
multi-agent chemotherapeutic approaches do not confer a
durable benefit in patients with metastatic and/or relapsed
disease, and fewer than 5% of patients survive 5 years
after advanced diagnosis.[9]
We embarked on this study to analyze the
characteristics and outcomes of patients with advanced CC
and GC with very aggressive biology referred for phase I
clinical trials at a major cancer center with an emphasis on
targeted agents to elicit early response signals.

We reviewed the characteristics and outcomes of
72 consecutive patients with GC and CC referred to the
Clinical Center for Targeted Therapy (Phase I Clinical
Trials Program) at MD Anderson Cancer Center starting
from November 2004. Eligibility criteria for participation
in phase I clinical trials included age >18 years, presence
of metastatic or unresectable disease, measurable disease
per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors
(RECIST) 1.0,[10] Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group
(ECOG) performance status (PS) of 0-1,[11] and a life
expectancy >3 months. Premenopausal women were
required to have a negative pregnancy test and patients
of childbearing potential to use contraception. Further
eligibility criteria varied according to the particular study
and all patients gave informed consent. This study and
all clinical trials were approved by the MD Anderson
Institutional Review Board.
After review of baseline clinical, laboratory,
radiologic and pathologic data during the initial
consultation, patients were enrolled on a phase I trial
based on scientific rationale and protocol availability.
After initiation of an investigational therapy, patients were
evaluated at 2- to 4- week intervals, based on the specific
protocol, with a medical history, physical examination,
comprehensive series of laboratory tests, and assessments
of toxicity and compliance. Restaging scans were done
every 6-8 weeks, depending on the protocol. Obstructive
cholestasis were managed according to the patients
performance status and clinical status by interventional
radiologist intervention or a stent placement by the gastrointestinal consult team.

Endpoints and Statistical Methods

Partial response (PR) was defined as a >30% decrease in
the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, excluding
complete disappearance of disease (complete response,
CR) and progressive disease (PD) was a > 20% increase.
Stable disease (SD) was defined as changes that did not
meet the criteria for a PR or PD. Waterfall plot analysis
according to RECIST is used to illustrate response.
Overall survival was measured from the date of
enrollment on a phase I trial until death from any cause
or date of last follow-up. PFS is defined as the time from
first day of treatment on a phase I trial to date when
treatment on the last phase I trial ceased due to disease
progression or death, but not toxicity. Patients still alive
(in case of survival analysis) and free of progression (in
case of PFS analysis) were censored at time of last followup. Toxicities were assessed using the National Cancer
Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse
Events, version per the protocol.[13] A P-value <.05 was
considered statistically significant. Statistical analysis was
performed using S-PLUS® 8.0 for Windows (Insightful
Corp.).

All statistical analysis was performed by our
biostatistician (K.R.H.). Descriptive statistics summarized
the patients’ characteristics. Cox proportional hazards
regression analysis was used to examine the association
between progression-free survival (PFS) since beginning
phase I therapy and the following variables measured at
the time of initial phase I consultation: age at diagnosis,
gender, ECOG PS, number of metastatic sites, number
of prior therapies, hemoglobin, lactate dehydrogenase
(LDH), platelet count, history of thromboembolism,
total bilirubin, aspartate aminotransferase (AST),
alanine aminotransferase (ALT), alkaline phosphatase,
serum sodium, serum creatinine, tumor markers
(carcinoembryonic antigen [CEA], carbohydrate antigens
[CAs] CA 19-9, CA 125, CA 27.29), presence of ascites,
serum albumin, and the Royal Marsden Hospital (RMH)
prognostic score (comprised of serum albumin <3.5 g/dL,
lactate dehydrogenase > upper limit of normal and > 2
metastatic sites).[12]
Best response was assessed using RECIST 1.0 every
2 cycles (6-8 weeks) of therapy as per the protocol.[10]

RESULTS

Therapy before patient inclusion in phase I trials
Overall, of the 40 patients enrolled on a phase I
trial, two patients had received no prior therapy because
of the unavailability of reasonable, conventional therapy
for the extent of their disease. The remaining 38 patients
had a median of 3 prior systemic therapies before referral
to the Phase I Clinic (range, 1 – 11). Fifteen patients
(38%) also underwent a prior surgical resection, whereas
13 (33%) received prior radiation and 3 (8%) had prior
chemoembolization.
The National Comprehensive Cancer Network
(NCCN) guidelines for unresectable gallbladder and
cholangiocarcinoma include a gemcitabine/cisplatin
combination therapy, fluoropyrimidine-based or othergemcitabine based regimen.[4, 14] For their first-line
treatment in the advanced/metastatic setting, 4 of 38
patients received experimental therapy on phase II trials
with a novel paclitaxel conjugate or a campotothecin
analog. The remaining 34 patients received a firstline regimen based on gemcitabine (N=24, 71%), a
fluoropyrimidine (N=7, 21%), or single-agent sorafenib
(N=3, 8%). As their second-line therapy in the advanced
disease setting, 36 patients received a regimen including
gemcitabine (N=17, 47%), a fluropyrimidine (N=16, 45%),
or a targeted agent (N=3, 8%); 2 patients did not received
a second line treatment and instead began phase I therapy.
All 38 patients were treated on a regimen based on FDAapproved drugs as their last antineoplastic therapy before
beginning a phase I trial; 58% received a fluoropyrimidinebased regimen (26% received fluoropyrimidine agents
in combination with platinum), whereas 23% received a

Patients Characteristics
Of the 72 patients with GC and CC referred to the
Phase I Clinical Trials program, 32 patients (30 CC and
2 GC) were not enrolled in a phase I clinical trial due to
deterioration of performance status (N=25), decision to
pursue alternate therapies including treatments closer to
home (N=6), and insurance denial (N=1). Forty patients
who participated in a phase I trial are included in this
analysis. Pretreatment characteristics at presentation to
the Phase I Clinic are summarized in Table 1. The median
age at diagnosis was 60 years (range, 41.4-73.6 years).
There were 23 women and 17 men. Thirty-one (78%)
were White, 5 (12%) were African American, and 4 (10%)
were Hispanic. Seven patients (18%) had an ECOG
PS of 0, 29 patients (72%) had a PS of 1 and 4 (10%)
patients a 2. Of the 40 patients treated, 6 had gallbladder
carcinoma, 4 had extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma and 30
had intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma; the tumor histology
for all 40 patients was consistent with adenocarcinoma.
The median number of metastatic sites was 3 (range 0-6).
The most common sites of metastases at time of phase I
referral were liver (90% of patients), lymph nodes (83%),
peritoneum (40%), retroperitoneum (38%) and lung
(38%). The median time from initial phase I consultation
to day one on a phase I trial was 16 days.

Response

Treatment

Six patients were not restaged prior to end of
cycle 2 due to clinical deterioration and early disease
progression. Of the 40 patients treated on clinical studies,
3 (8%) had a partial response (PR), 17 had stable disease
(43%) including 8 (20%) who had SD > 6 months, and
20 patients had progressive disease (PD) with a SD>
6 months/PR rate of 27.5% (Figure 1). The highest
rates of prolonged SD > 6 months/PR were observed
in patients treated with protocols that included hepatic
arterial infusion (HAI) of oxaliplatin or paclitaxel (7 of 17
patients treated on HAI regimens, 41%) or antiangiogenic
agents (9 of 24 patients, 38%) with 6 of those patients
receiving treatment that included HAI of oxaliplatin
combined with systemic bevacizumab (Figure 2; Table
3). A prolonged SD of 10.8 months was observed in a
patient with metastatic GC with HER-2/neu amplification
who was treated on phase I protocols, first combining
the anti-HER-2/neu antibody trastuzumab and the HER2/neu tyrosine kinase inhibitor lapatinib, and then with
trastuzumab and erlotinib. Prolonged SD lasting 9 months
was also seen in one patient treated on a first-in-human
trial using a novel MEK inhibitor.

Overall, patients were initially treated on 1 of 22
phase I clinical trials; of these trials, 8 patients received
therapy on six first-in-human trials with novel targeted
inhibitors against MEK, VEGF, gamma-secretase,
aurora kinase and the IGF-IR pathway. Of 40 patients,
30 (75%) were treated on a trial with combination
therapy of two or more agents while 10 patients (25%)
received treatment with a single agent. Seventeen (43%)
patients received locoregional treatment with direct
infusion of a cytotoxic agent into the hepatic artery; 24
(60%) received intravenous angiogenesis inhibitors,
of whom 13 (33%) received the antiangiogenic agent
in combination with hepatic arterial infusion therapy.
Fifteen (38%) patients received targeted agent(s) alone,
20 (50%) received targeted agent(s) in combination with
cytotoxic chemotherapy, and 5 (12%) received cytotoxic
chemotherapy alone. The median number of cycles
received was 2 (range 1 – 12). Six patients went on to

Survival and toxicities
For the 40 patients treated on phase I trials, the time
from diagnosis of advanced (metastatic) disease to primary
evaluation in the Phase I Clinical Center for Targeted
Therapy was 13.1 months. The median time from the
initial phase I consultation to day 1 of a trial was 16 days.
The overall median survival from day 1 on a phase I trial
was 4.2 months (95% CI 3.8 – 8.6 months). Median PFS
for 40 treated patients was 2.0 months (95% CI 1.8, 3.4) on
phase I clinical trials. Among these 40 patients, the median
PFS on their first-line and second-line prior therapies with
FDA-approved agents given in the advanced setting was
3.0 months (95% CI 2.4, 5.0) and 3.0 months (95% CI
2.3, 4.6), respectively. Median PFS on their last FDAapproved treatment before phase I referral was 3.0 months
(95% CI 2.4, 3.9). In comparison, the median PFS on
phase I therapy did not differ significantly from that on
their first-line or second-line FDA-approved agents given
for advanced disease or their last treatment prior to phase
I referral (P=0.95, 0.98, 0.76, respectively) (Figure 3A).
Data were also analyzed from the 32 patients who were
not enrolled on phase I trials and the PFS of their first-,
second-line, and last treatment with FDA-approved agents
prior to phase I referral (3.1, 2.4, 3.0 months, respectively)
also did not differ significantly from the PFS of the phase
I-treated patients.

Overall survival from enrollment on a phase I trial
to date of death is shown in Figure 3B. Among the 40
treated patients, 38 (95%) had died at the time of analysis.
The 90-day mortality was 38% with 25 patients alive at
3 months after beginning phase I therapy; the 6-month
mortality was 63% with 15 patients alive at 6 months
after beginning therapy on phase I trials. Importantly,
there was no treatment-related mortality. Two patients
treated on different combination regimens that included an
angiogenesis inhibitor experienced grade 3 gastrointestinal
bleeding, prompting a change of regimen, with overall
progression-free period of 10.8 and 16.8 months,
respectively, on their subsequent phase I trials. The only
other grade 3 toxicity that prompted removal from study
was the development of an arteriovenous fistula in one
patient due to the placement of the hepatic arterial infusion
catheter.

Indeed, Bendell and colleagues also demonstrated a PR
in cholangiocarcinoma treated with a MEK 1/2 inhibitor.
[17] Although KRAS mutations may sensitize a tumor to
MEK inhibitors,[18] the KRAS status of our patient with
prolonged stable disease on a novel MEK inhibitor was
unknown due to lack of tissue available for molecular
analysis.
Overall, the pattern of molecular aberrations seen
in GC and CC is slowly emerging. Somatic mutations of
KRAS, most commonly G12D and G13D, and PIK3CA,
most commonly E545K, along with deletion of p53 have
been reported in CCs; activating mutations in PIK3CA
have also been reported in 12.5% of patients with GC,
highlighting the therapeutic targeting potential of the
RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK pathway and PI3K/AKT/MTOR
pathway.[19, 20] It is conceivable that the responses
to MEK inhibitors seen in CC are due to the frequency
of KRAS mutations among these patients (13%).[20]
Most recently, tissue from 9 of 40 patients (23%) with
intrahepatic CC was shown to harbor mutations in the gene
encoding isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1).[21] The
clinical significance of this is not known, but one proposed
mechanism demonstrates that a heterozygous IDH1
mutation leads to elevated levels of hypoxia-inducible
factor subunit HIF-1alpha, thereby promoting tumor
development and suggesting that IDH1 may be a tumor
suppressor. We have recently shown that better response
rates, time to treatment failure, and overall survival are
associated with matching therapy to actionable mutations,
highlighting the importance of further assessment of this
strategy in these populations.[22]
Our analysis demonstrates that the PFS of phase
I therapy in our program is comparable to that of the
first-line, second-line and last prior treatment options
with FDA-approved agents for advanced disease. There
are several limitations to our analysis. First, a selection
bias exists within our patient population given that
the patients presented with widely metastatic disease
and the PFS on frontline therapies in this population,
particularly following treatment with the gemcitabine/
cisplatin combination, was shorter than that reported in
the pivotal phase III trial.[14] Such findings may suggest
a more aggressive tumor behavior that has yet to be
characterized among our patients. Second, a substantial
number of patients (32 of 72 referred patients, 44%) were
not enrolled on a phase I trial. This was due, for the most
part, to clinical deterioration, although the first-, second-,
and last line PFS among these untreated patients did
not differ from that of the 40 patients treated on a phase
I trial. Thirdly, we were unable to conduct an effective
multivariate analysis given the small sample size. Finally,
mutational analysis was only performed in a small subset
of patients due to the lack of tissue availability for testing.
Additionally, data on quality of life as an endpoint was not

the KRAS proto-oncogene. Of 11 tested patients, a KRAS
mutation was detected in the tumor of two patients with
cholangiocarcinoma, one in codon 12 and another in
codon 13.[15] A third patient’s gallbladder carcinoma
demonstrated FISH amplification of HER-2/neu (HER-2/
neu: CEP17 signal ratio: 6.49). This patient maintained
SD for 27 months with a HER-2/neu targeting agent prior
to progression; then, phase I therapy including HER-2/
neu targeting agents resulted in SD for an additional 10.8
months.

DISCUSSION
Treatment options for patients with advanced
unresectable GC and CC are limited given the poor
outcomes of even frontline therapies with FDA-approved
agents. Complete surgical resection remains the only
curative modality of therapy, offering benefit only for
patients with localized disease. The NCCN guidelines for
relapsed GC and CC highlight the limited clinical trial data
that can be used to define a standard regimen or definitive
benefit with an emphasis on clinical trial participation.[3,
16]
Approximately 44% of patients with CC and GC
referred for phase I trials were ineligible, mainly because
of poor performance status (ECOG PS 3 or greater).
Our analysis shows 28% of our patients achieved SD
> 6months/PR mainly with locoregional therapy with
hepatic arterial infusion and angiogenesis inhibitors,
suggesting that these modalities merit further investigation
in similar patients. Additionally, the fact that SD >
6months was seen with targeted therapies including a

collected and, given the poor prognosis of these patients,
an emphasis on quality of life measurements becomes
critical. Future clinical trials should include quality of life
as an important end point.
Predictors of shorter phase I PFS in univariate
analysis were a higher number of metastatic site (>3),
elevated serum ALT (>56 IU/L), elevated serum creatinine
(>1.6 mg/dL), and high CA19-9 (>35 U/mL). Overall, the
short PFS reflects the rather dismal outcomes of these
advanced GC and CC patients and emphasizes the need
for new approaches. Since 28% of our patients who were
able to enroll of a trial achieved SD > 6 months/PR mainly
on our trials with locoregional therapy, anti-angiogenic
agents, MEK and HER-2/neu inhibitors, these strategies
may merit further exploration.
