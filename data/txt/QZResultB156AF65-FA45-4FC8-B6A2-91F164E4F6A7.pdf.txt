Abstract
Neuroblastoma (NB) is the most common solid extracranial cancer of childhood. Amplification and overexpression of the MYCN oncogene characterize the most aggressive forms and are believed to severely downregulate MHC class I molecules by transcriptional inhibition of the p50 NF-κB subunit. In this study, we found
that in human NB cell lines, high MYCN expression is not responsible for low MHC class I expression because
neither transfection-mediated overexpression nor small interfering RNA suppression of MYCN affects MHC
class I and p50 levels. Furthermore, we identified NF-κB as the immediate upstream regulator of MHC class I
because the p65 NF-κB subunit binds MHC class I promoter in chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments,
and MHC class I expression is enhanced by p65 transfection and reduced by (a) the chemical NF-κB inhibitor
sulfasalazine, (b) a dominant-negative IKBα gene, and (c) p65 silencing. Moreover, we showed that the endoplasmic reticulum aminopeptidases ERAP1 and ERAP2, which generate MHC class I binding peptides, are
regulated by NF-κB, contain functional NF-κB–binding elements in their promoters, and mimic MHC class
I molecules in the expression pattern. Consistent with these findings, nuclear p65 was detected in NB cells that
express MHC class I molecules in human NB specimens. Thus, the coordinated downregulation of MHC class
I, ERAP1, and ERAP2 in aggressive NB cells is attributable to a low transcriptional availability of NF-κB, possibly due to an unknown suppressor other than MYCN. Cancer Res; 70(3); 916–24. ©2010 AACR.

Introduction
Neuroblastoma (NB) is the most common malignancy diagnosed in the first year of life. This tumor arises from neural
crest cells and shows a wide range of clinical outcomes ranging from spontaneous regression to therapy-resistant progression. Patients bearing aggressive NB tumors have survival
probabilities of <40% despite intensive chemoradiotherapy.
NB exhibits several genomic alterations, including MYCN
gene amplification; chromosomal deletions at 1p, 3p, and
11q; and chromosomal gain at 17q (1, 2). MYCN amplification
is consistently associated with high MYCN protein levels and
is regarded as a hallmark of poor prognosis and treatment
failure (3).

Like many other (proto)oncogene products (4), MYCN and
the highly homologous nuclear oncogene c-MYC have been
implicated in the downregulation of MHC class I (MHC I)
molecules in man (5–7) and rat (8–10), but some aspects
of this regulation remain controversial. In a rat NB cell
line, high levels of MYCN, obtained by the gene transfection,
have been shown to repress MHC I expression (8–10). However, such repression effect on MHC I expression has not
been detected on the MYCN transfection in a human NB cell
line (7).
In the B104 rat NB cell line, MYCN expression was shown
to downregulate the expression of p50, a subunit shared by
NF-κB and KBF1, two transcription factors of the NF-κB/Rel
family (8–10). NF-κB is well known to transactivate MHC I
heavy chains and their light chain β2-microglobulin (β2m)
by binding to the cis-regulatory promoter element called enhancer A (11, 12). However, no direct evidence that MYCN
impairs NF-κB/enhancer A interaction or MHC I expression
has been reported in human cells.
Moreover, it is unknown whether MYCN is involved, besides MHC I and β2m molecules, in the regulation of the
MHC I antigen-processing functions that are required for
MHC I expression.
In this respect, we have recently shown that malignant
transformation causes losses, gains, and imbalances in the expression of human MHC I and two antigen-processing gene
products: the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) aminopeptidases
ERAP1 and ERAP2 (13, 14). The concerted peptide-trimming

NF-κB Regulates MHC Class I and ER Aminopeptidases in NB

activity of ERAP1 and ERAP2 optimizes precursor peptides
for binding to MHC I molecules and shapes a normal T-cell
repertoire (15). We showed that altered expression of these
genes impairs, as expected, both peptide-trimming and
MHC I expression in tumor tissues and cultured tumor cell
lines (13, 14). Interestingly, MHC I and ERAP1 were coordinately expressed in normal and, to a lesser extent, neoplastic
cells and tumor lesions (13, 14). This raises the possibility that
MYCN affects the expression of these aminopeptidases and
consequently represses MHC I expression.
In this report, we show that not only MHC I but also
ERAP1 and ERAP2 are under the control of NF-κB through
enhancer A in human NB cells. However, none of these genes
is under the direct control of MYCN, and the low availability
of transcriptionally active NF-κB by itself explains the low
expression levels of ERAP1, ERAP2, and MHC I in NB cell
lines regardless of the levels of MYCN expression.

Materials and Methods
Tumor cell lines and reagents. Human NB cell lines, obtained from the American Type Culture Collection, grown in
RPMI 1640 with 10% FCS, were characterized by morphology
and HLA class I typing. SH-EP MYCN-ER and Tet-21/N cell
lines were kindly provided by Drs. B. Berwanger (Children's
Hospital, Medical Center, Marburg, Germany; ref. 16) and
M. Schwab (Johann Wolfgang Goethe-University, Frankfurt,
Germany; ref. 17), respectively. 4-Hydroxytamoxifen (4-OHT)
and doxycycline, both from Sigma-Aldrich, were used at
200 nmol/L and 10 ng/mL, respectively. Recombinant human
tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα; PeproTech) and IFNγ (R&D
Systems) were used at 50 ng/mL and 500 units/mL, respectively. Sulfasalazine and MYCN small interfering RNAs
(siRNA) were from Sigma-Aldrich. The p65 siRNAs were
from Cell Signaling Technology.
DNA constructs and transfections. Mutant IκBα (18) and
NF-κB p65 (kindly provided by Drs. M. Cippitelli, University of
Rome Sapienza, Rome, Italy, and M. Levrero, Rome Oncogenomic Center, Regina Elena Institute, Rome, Italy, respectively)
and the corresponding empty vectors were transfected using
Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). For p65 and MYCN silencing, cells were transfected with 100 nmol/L siRNAs or scrambled siRNA using Lipofectamine 2000.
Real-time PCR. Total RNA was extracted with Trizol reagent (Invitrogen) and retrotranscribed with SuperScript II
(Invitrogen). Reverse transcription and real-time PCR were performed as described (19). 18S RNA was used for normalization.
Antibodies. The A-LAP and 3F5 antibodies were raised
against ERAP1 and ERAP2, respectively (15, 20). MHC I was detected by Western blotting using R5996-4 (21) and by flow cytometry using W6/32 (22) and the HLA-A locus-specific TU155
(23). The antibodies to MYCN, p50, p65, and proliferating cell
nuclear antigen (PCNA) were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology.
Immunoblotting. Whole-cell and nuclear extracts obtained as previously described (13, 24) were quantified by
bicinchoninic acid assay (Pierce), resolved on 10% SDSPAGE, and electroblotted. Filters were probed with primary
antibodies followed by secondary peroxidase-coupled

antibodies. ERp57 and PCNA were used as loading control
of whole-cell and nuclear extracts, respectively.
Immunofluorescence and immunohistochemistry. MHC
I surface expression was determined by flow cytometry
with the indicated antibodies on a FACSCalibur (Becton
Dickinson). For detection of NF-κB nuclear translocation,
cells were grown on polystyrene glass slides, fixed in cold
methanol-acetone (2:1), blocked in 1% bovine serum albumin
and 0.5% goat serum, and stained with antibody to p65.
The cells were then washed with PBS, incubated with FITCconjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Vector), and counterstained
with the nuclear dye DRAQ5 (Biostatus). The cells were analyzed in a confocal microscope (Olympus FluoView FV1000).
Primary NB lesions were obtained on informed parental
consent and snap frozen in liquid nitrogen. Cryostat sections
(4 μm thick) were fixed either in cold absolute acetone and
stained by W6/32 to MHC I, or in acetone-methanol (1:1, v/v)
and stained by NF-κB p65 antibody. Staining was revealed by
a supersensitive immunohistochemistry kit (BioGenex), as
described (14).
Chromatin immunoprecipitation. Chromatin immunoprecipitation was performed as described (25) using the
NF-κB p65 monoclonal antibody. The immunoprecipitated
DNA was amplified by using specific primers. Primer sequences are listed in Supplementary Data.
Statistical analysis. Raw data were normalized as the percent of the highest value obtained for each assay. Regression
and significance were analyzed by the StatView software. A
P value of <0.05 was considered statistically significant.

Results
MYCN, MHC I, ERAP1, ERAP2, and NF-κB expression in
NB cell lines. Because MYCN is inversely correlated with
MHC I (8–10), and MHC I is positively correlated with ERAP1
expression in human cell lines of various lineages (13, 14), we
looked for expression patterns of MYCN, MHC I heavy chain,
ERAP1, and ERAP2 by Western blotting (Fig. 1A) and of cell
surface MHC I by flow cytometry (Fig. 1B) in a panel of human NB cell lines. Representative regression plots of normalized densitometric values of Western blotting and mean
fluorescence intensity values of flow cytometry are shown
in Supplementary Fig. S1A.
It was evident (Fig. 1A) that MHC I heavy chain and ERAP1
are expressed at high levels in the ACN, SH-EP, and SK-N-AS
cell lines and at low levels in the IMR-32, KCNR, LA-N-5, SKN-BE(2), SH-SY5Y, SK-N-SH, and SK-N-SY cell lines. This latter group of NB cell lines displayed a limited variability in
MHC I heavy chain and ERAP1 expression in spite of marked
differences in MYCN expression. Accordingly, regression
analysis of Western blotting data (Supplementary Fig. S1A)
revealed the inverse correlation between MYCN and MHC I
heavy chains (R2 = 0.27; P = 0.13). A similar inverse correlation was found between MYCN and ERAP1 (R2 = 0.23; P =
0.16). MYCN and cell surface MHC I also showed an inverse
correlation (R2 = 0.35; P = 0.07). However, none of these correlations reached the significance threshold. In contrast,
highly significant correlations were detected between ERAP1

This is consistent with the finding obtained for other human
cell lines (13). Any of MYCN, MHC I, and ERAP1 did not significantly correlate with ERAP2.
NF-κB has been known to be involved in MHC I expression
(11, 12) and the p50 NF-κB subunit has been claimed to directly correlate with MHC I expression in the rat B104 NB

as well as the p105 precursor, were assessed for the wholecell lysates in representative NB cell lines by Western blotting
(Fig. 1C). Densitometric data were analyzed for the correlation with those of MHC I heavy chain, ERAP1, and ERAP2

NF-κB Regulates MHC Class I and ER Aminopeptidases in NB

revealed that MHC I heavy chain correlated significantly with
p50 (R2 = 0.84; P = 0.01) and with p105 (R2 = 0.64; P = 0.05)
and that ERAP1 also correlates with p50 (R2 = 0.86; P = 0.008)
and p105 (R2 = 0.88; P = 0.006). Similar correlations were
found for cell surface MHC I with p50 (R2 = 0.92; P = 0.03)
and with p105 (R2 = 0.94; P = 0.001). On the other hand, no
significant correlations were found for p65 with any of MHC I
heavy chain, ERAP1, and ERAP2 and cell surface MHC I.
MYCN showed inverse and nonsignificant correlation with
p50 (R2 = 0.45; P = 0.14), p65 (R2 = 0.30; P = 0.26), and p105
(R2 = 0.57; P = 0.08).
Thus, MHC I, ERAP1, and the NF-κB p105 and p50 subunits are linked each other by statistically significant patterns
of coordinated expression, whereas their correlations with
MYCN were inverse and nonsignificant, and ERAP2 and
p65 behaved as completely independent variables.
MYCN does not regulate the expression of MHC I, ERAP1,
ERAP2, and NF-κB subunits in NB cell lines. To directly determine whether MYCN downregulates MHC I and NF-κB expression and affects ERAP1 and ERAP2 expression in human
NB cell lines, we induced rapid changes in the functional expression of MYCN in two MYCN-transfected NB cell line:
SH-EP MYCN-ER (16) and Tet-21/N (16). SH-EP MYCN-ER
carries 4-OHT–responsive MYCN transgene fused to a mutagen estrogen-responsive domain (ER), whereas Tet-21/N
carries a tetracycline-repressible MYCN transgene. The expression of MYCN is activated with 4-OHT treatment in
SH-EP MYCN-ER and suppressed with doxycycline treatment
in Tet-21/N. These two cell lines, untreated or treated with 4OHT or doxycycline, were tested by Western blotting for the
expression of MHC I, ERAP1, ERAP2, as well as NF-κB p105,
p50, and p65. MYCN expression was drastically activated
with 4-OHT treatment in SH-EP MYCN-ER, as indicated by
the strong upregulation of the known MYCN target gene
HMGA1 (high mobility group A1; ref. 26) determined by quan-

titative reverse transcription-PCR (qRT-PCR; Supplementary
Fig. S2), and drastically suppressed by doxycycline treatment
in Tet-21/N, as determined by Western blotting (Fig. 2B). In
spite of this clear change of MYCN expression, no noticeable
change was seen in any of MHC I heavy chain, ERAP1,
ERAP2, and NF-κB p105, p50, and p65 in both cell lines tested
(Fig. 2A and B). Furthermore, MYCN silencing by RNA interference in SH-SY5Y cells did not affect the levels of any of
MHC I, ERAP1, ERAP2, and NF-κB p105, p50, and p65 as
compared with the controls (Fig. 2C).
Thus, MYCN is not directly involved in the regulation of
MHC I, ERAP1, ERAP2, and NF-κB expression in NB cell lines.
Effect of TNFα on the expression of MHC I, ERAP1,
ERAP2, and NF-κB. The coordinated expression of MHC I,
ERAP1, and NF-κB indicates the possibility that ERAP1 is
regulated by the same transcription factor as MHC I (i.e.,
NF-κB). To address the regulatory role of NF-κB in the
MHC I and ERAP1 expression, NB cell lines that differ in
MHC I, ERAP1, and ERAP2 protein level were treated with
TNFα, a major inducer of NF-κB nuclear translocation, and
the NF-κB p50 and p65 subunits were assayed for the nuclear
extracts.
As shown in Fig. 3A, TNFα mediated detectable nuclear
translocation of both p50 and p65 subunits in SH-EP and
SK-N-AS that were high in constitutive MHC I and ERAP1
expression. This was associated by steady-state accumulation
of MHC I, ERAP1, and ERAP2 in SH-EP and MHC I and
ERAP1 in SK-N-AS (Fig. 3A) and also by surface enhancement
of MHC I molecules (Fig. 3B). These results were confirmed
at the mRNA level by qRT-PCR (Supplementary Fig. S3). The
observed enhancing effects of TNFα were not seen in other
NB cell lines that were low in MHC I, ERAP1, and ERAP2 expression (Fig. 3A and B).
To rule out that MYCN expression per se might cause the
difference in the responsiveness to TNFα treatment of NB

cell lines, the Tet-21/N cell line was treated with TNFα in the
presence and absence of doxycycline and tested for p50 and
p65 in the nuclear extracts. In spite of drastic MYCN repression, no changes were detected in either constitutive nuclear
expression or TNFα-mediated translocation of p50 and p65
(Supplementary Fig. S4).
Altogether, it seems that the availability of nuclear NF-κB
subunits correlates with MHC I, ERAP1, and ERAP2 levels in
all the tested NB cells regardless of MYCN expression and
that some factors other than MYCN repress nuclear translocation of NF-κB in NB cell lines.
NF-κB regulates MHC I, ERAP1, and ERAP2 in NB cell
lines. To explore further the relevancy of NF-κB to ERAP1
and ERAP2 expression, we used three different approaches:
(a) to inhibit NF-κB nuclear translocation with specific inhibitors, (b) to inhibit NF-κB expression by silencing p65 subunit expression with a p65-specific siRNA, and (c) to enhance
NF-κB p65 subunit by transfection of a p65 expression vector.
In the first approach (a), sulfasalazine, a chemical inhibitor
of nuclear NF-κB translocation, was shown to prevent nuclear translocation of p65 in SH-EP (Supplementary Fig. S5) and
SK-N-AS (data not shown) cells in a dose-dependent fashion.

920

Cancer Res; 70(3) February 1, 2010

At the optimal dosage, sulfasalazine treatment strongly reduced the constitutive and/or TNFα-induced expression of
MHC I, ERAP1, and ERAP2 in these cells (Fig. 4A). Furthermore, a stable SH-EP transfectant carrying an IκBα mutant
(M-IκBα) that is refractory to TNFα (18) was shown to be
drastically impaired in nuclear translocation of p65, as assessed by immunofluorescence in a time course experiment
(Supplementary Fig. S6), and in MHC I, ERAP1, and ERAP2
mRNA accumulation (Fig. 4B). The effect of the mutant IκBα
was specific because IFNγ enhanced the expression of MHC
I, ERAP1, and ERAP2 mRNA equally well in SH-EP cells transfected with both M-IκBα and the empty vector, whereas
TNFα enhanced expression of the tested genes less efficiently
in SH-EP cells transfected with IκBα than cell with the empty
vector (Fig. 4B).
In the second approach (b), p65-specific siRNA was shown
to knock down p65 and reduced MHC I, ERAP1, and ERAP2
expression in SH-EP cells, as assessed by Western blotting
(Fig. 4C).
In the last approach (c), five representative NB cell lines
that differ in MYCN, MHC I, ERAP1, and ERAP2 protein level
(Fig. 1A) were transfected with a vector bearing p65 cDNA
(p65) or the empty vector (pcDNA3) and looked for expression of p65, MHC I heavy chain, ERAP1, and ERAP2 by Western blotting and for cell surface MHC I by flow cytometry
(Fig. 4D). As shown in Fig. 4D, p65 transfection enhanced expression of p65 in all the tested NB cell lines. MHC I heavy
chain was enhanced in all the tested cell lines, particularly
well in SH-SY5Y, IMR-32, and SK-N-BE(2)c, except LAN-5,
whereas ERAP1 was clearly enhanced in SH-EP, SH-SY5Y,
and SK-N-BE(2)c. Flow cytometry of the four cell lines in
which p65 effectively upregulates MHC I heavy chain showed
that MHC I surface expression was fairly proportional to the
level of MHC I heavy chain in SH-EP and SH-SY5Y but not in
IMR-32 and SK-N-BE(2)c in which only a marginal increase
was noticeable (Fig. 4D). This poor surface MHC I expression
may result from impaired expression of some components in
MHC I–presenting machinery, such as β2m and TAP, other
than MHC I heavy chain.
These results indicate that NF-κB upregulates MHC I,
ERAP1, and ERAP2 in NB cell lines, and the low expression
of these genes is due to a low efficiency of NF-κB in activating target gene transcription, presumably consequence of a
poor constitutive NF-κB nuclear expression, and/or the nuclear translocation as suggested by the TNFα unresponsiveness in several tested NB cell lines (Fig. 3A).
Recruitment of NF-κB to ERAP1 and ERAP2 promoter
regions. Because NF-κB directly binds enhancer A elements
in the promoters of MHC I genes (27), we looked for similar
sequences in the promoter regions of ERAP1 (28) and ERAP2
(29). Enhancer A elements were detected in both promoters
at positions −79 and −14 and displayed 90% and 70% analogies with the canonical MHC I enhancer A sequence, respectively. Of interest, enhancer A elements were close to ISRE
sequences, as in MHC I genes (Fig. 5A).
To evaluate the recruitment of NF-κB to these promoter
regions, PCR primers were designed for the different gene promoters and ChIP assays were performed using an anti-p65

antibody to precipitate chromatin fragments from SH-EP
cells, either untreated or treated (1 hour) with TNFα. The
interleukin-8 (IL-8) gene promoter, a known target of NF-κB
(30), was used as a control. As shown in Fig. 5B, p65 specifically
binds all the tested promoters (lane 3), and the signal is strongly increased following TNFα stimulation (lane 5). Remarkably,
the increased recruitment of p65 to these promoter regions
results in the expected enhancement in surface MHC I expression as shown by flow cytometry with HLA-A–specific mAb
TU155 (Fig. 5C). These data show that ERAP1 and ERAP2
are regulated through the NF-κB/enhancer A pathway and
provide a molecular basis for the coordinated expression of
these genes with MHC I in NB cell lines.
Expression of MHC I and NF-κB in primary NB samples.
To determine whether the correlation between MHC I expression and the expression/nuclear localization of NF-κB
might also be observed in vivo, 32 primary NB lesions were
tested by immunohistochemistry. Like in previous studies

(31–34), no MHC I expression could be detected in the neuroblastic cell components. However, careful inspection revealed scattered W6/32-positive cells with distribution and
morphology reminiscent of gangliar cells (e.g., most differentiated neuroblastic cells) in eight tumors (Fig. 6A). Remarkably, only these cells displayed nuclear p65 staining (Fig. 6B).
These results suggest in vitro-in vivo analogies in MHC I regulation by NF-κB.

Discussion
Overexpression of MYCN has been shown to interfere with
the expression of MHC I by blocking the transcription of
p105 NF-κB precursor in a rat NB cell line (8–10). NF-κB is
a well-known transcription factor that binds a consensus regulatory region upstream of MHC I genes, known as enhancer
A (11). Although an inverse correlation between MYCN and
MHC I has been reported in human NB cell lines, a direct

10, 34), the present data clearly show that MYCN does not
regulate MHC I and NF-κB expression in human NB cell
lines. It will be of interest to assess the effect of MYCN on
MHC I expression in rat NB cell lines other than B104.
In addition, we confirm that NF-κB is a master transactivator of MHC I in NB because overexpression of the p65 NFκB subunit reverses the MHC I–low phenotype of NB cell
lines, and conversely, inhibition of NF-κB accumulation
and/or nuclear translocation by either chemical inhibitors
or overexpression of a dominant-negative IκBα gene causes
a reduction in MHC I expression both at steady-state level
and following TNFα treatment (Figs. 3 and 4). Moreover,
we provide evidence that NF-κB is the immediate upstream
regulator of MHC I expression in NB because it binds the
MHC I promoter directly and proportionally to constitutive
and TNFα-mediated activation (Fig. 5). Thus, whereas a direct involvement of MYCN in human MHC I expression may
be excluded, the involvement of NF-κB and the underlying
mechanism are clearly shown by the present data.
Herein, we distinguished two different NB cell phenotypes
depending on the constitutive activation of NF-κB: phenotype (a), NB cells that express high levels of nuclear p65
NF-κB and consequently high levels of NF-κB target genes,
such as MHC I molecules; phenotype (b), NB cells that express neither nuclear p65 NF-κB nor high levels of MHC I
molecules. These two cell phenotypes differ also in terms
of responsiveness to TNFα, suggesting that the two conditions, constitutively activated versus constitutively inactivated (and not TNFα-activable) NF-κB, are essential for
their survival.

MHC I expression in human NB cells has been questioned
by the observation that MYCN overexpression does not repress MHC I expression in the human SK-N-AS NB cell line
(7). In the present report, we confirm that MYCN is inversely
related to MHC I expression in human NB cell lines (Fig. 1)
but also show that it does not have a direct effect on either
the levels of MHC I molecules or the expression and nuclear

NF-κB Regulates MHC Class I and ER Aminopeptidases in NB

NF-κB is a transcription factor known to promote cell survival and induce apoptosis depending on cell type and context
(35). Two recent studies have focused on the importance of
NF-κB in the survival of NB cells (36, 37). They show that
NF-κB activity and function differ according to different NB cell
phenotype. In agreement with our data, they detect a constitutively active NF-κB in SH-EP and SK-N-AS cell lines (37) and a
constitutively inactive NF-κB in SH-SY5Y and IMR-32 cell lines
(36) and show that these conditions are required for the cell
survival because the NF-κB inhibition in the former, as well
as the NF-κB activation in the latter, induces apoptosis (36, 37).
To data, no evidence has been advanced about the identification of these two NB cell phenotypes in vivo. Herein, we provide
evidence that ganglion cells (e.g., the most maturating neuroblastic cells) selectively express high levels of MHC I molecules
and high levels of nuclear p65, whereas immature neuroblasts
express neither nuclear p65 nor MHC I molecules (Fig. 6).
During embryonic life, the development of the central and
peripheral nervous system is characterized by massive cellular death of still-immature neuroblasts before complete differentiation. It is possible that the lack of nuclear p65 in
immature neuroblast component of NB may represent the
fundamental requisite for survival of this cell type.
Finally, we show that changes in the expression and nuclear translocation of NF-κB similarly affect the peptidetrimming ERAP1 and ERAP2 enzymes. A molecular basis for
this coordinated downregulation is the presence in the promoters of these genes of functional NF-κB–binding enhancer
A sequences resembling those of MHC I genes. In the context
of the available evidence, this is to our knowledge the first
demonstration of a molecular mechanism underlying the coordinated downregulation of antigen-processing functions in

tumors at a single promoter site. Although under the control
of NF-κB, ERAP2 is not tightly coordinated with MHC I and
ERAP1, supporting our previous suggestion (13) that there are
additional ERAP2-specific regulatory factors.
It will be of interest to identify the NB gene repressor(s)
upstream of NF-κB responsible for the drastic reduction of
antigen-processing functions in neuroblastic cell types. This
putative repressor may eventually provide the missing link
between tumorigenesis and immune escape in NB.
