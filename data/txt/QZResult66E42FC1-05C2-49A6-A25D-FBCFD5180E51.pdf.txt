ABSTRACT
The tumor suppressor gene FBXW7 is deleted and mutated in many different
types of human cancers. FBXW7 primarily exerts its tumor suppressor activity by
ubiquitinating different oncoproteins including mTOR. Here we used gene transcript
profiling to gain a deeper understanding of the role of FBXW7 in tumor development and
to determine the influence of mTOR inhibition by rapamycin on tumor transcriptome
and biological functions. In comparison to tumors from p53 single heterozygous
(p53+/−) mice, we find that radiation-induced thymic lymphomas from Fbxw7/p53
double heterozygous (Fbxw7+/−p53+/−) mice show significant deregulation of
cholesterol metabolic processes independent of rapamycin treatment, while cell cycle
related genes were upregulated in tumors from placebo treated Fbxw7+/−p53+/−
mice, but not in tumors from rapamycin treated Fbxw7+/−p53+/− mice. On the other
hand, tumors from rapamycin treated Fbxw7+/−p53+/− mice were enriched for
genes involved in the integrated stress response, an adaptive mechanism to survive
in stressful environments. Finally, we demonstrated that the Fbxw7 gene signatures
identified in mouse tumors significantly overlap with FBXW7 co-expressed genes in
human cancers. Importantly these common FBXW7 gene signatures between mouse
and human are predictive for disease-free survival in human colon, breast and lung
adenocarcinoma cancer patients. These results provide novel insights into the role
of FBXW7 in tumor development and have identified a number of potential targets
for therapeutic intervention.

Mice that carry inactivated alleles of both Fbxw7 and p53
show acceleration of tumor development after radiation
exposure [19]. Mechanistically, it has been shown that
FBXW7 is essential for the ubiquitination of different
oncoproteins, including c-Myc [20, 21], c-Jun [22], CCNE
[23–25], different members of the Notch family [26–28],
Aurora-A [19, 29], and mTOR [30].
How does the decrease in FBXW7 function result in
tumor development? Deletion or mutation of the FBXW7
gene may result in impaired degradation of multiple
targets and their consequent accumulation, which may
cooperatively contribute to tumor development. Our
previous studies using mouse models showed that temporal
pharmacological inhibition of the mTOR pathway was
sufficient to suppress the tumor development contributed

INTRODUCTION
The human tumor suppressor gene FBXW7 encodes
an F-box protein, mutated and deleted in cancers from
a wide spectrum of human tissues, such as bile duct
[1], blood [2–5], bone [6], brain [7, 8], breast [9], colon
[10], endometrium [11], stomach [12], lung [13], ovary
[14], pancreas [15], and prostate [16]. The overall point
mutation frequency of FBXW7 in human cancers is
approximately 6% [1]. In the mouse, homozygous deletion
of the Fbxw7 gene leads to embryonic lethality, but
heterozygous mice develop normally [17, 18]. Although
they do not develop spontaneous tumors, radiation
exposure gives rise to different types of tumors, including
a range of epithelial cancers, albeit at low frequency.

by Fbxw7 loss, suggesting that the Fbxw7-mTOR pathway
plays a major role in this radiation-induced carcinogenesis
mouse model [31]. In this study, we used gene profiling
technology to elucidate the signaling pathways by which
Fbxw7 is involved, which could lead to identification of
new targets for therapeutic intervention.

SREBF1 and SREBF2 bind sterol regulatory sequences
in promoters of genes involved in sterol metabolic
processes. Our data suggests that loss of FBXW7 results
in up-regulation of cholesterol and sterol metabolism,
independent of the mTOR pathway. Consistent with this
finding are previous reports linking FBXW7 with SREBF
and a role for FBXW7 in regulating lipid metabolism in the
mouse liver [32, 33].

RESULTS

Upregulation of cell cycle related genes in
tumors from Fbxw7+/−p53+/− mice

Significant deregulation of cholesterol metabolic
processes in tumors from Fbxw7/p53 double
heterozygous mice

We next analyzed tumor transcript level changes
that were unique to the vehicle treated Fbxw7+/−p53+/−
mice (956 genes; Figure 1A). Network analyses showed
significant enrichment of cell cycle related genes
(Figure 2; p < 3.79E-02) consistent with the tumor
suppressor functions of Fbxw7 in cellular growth and
division pathways. Interestingly, we observed significant
enrichment of spingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) signaling
(Figure 2C; Supplementary Table S2). Cross-talk between
the S1P and mTOR pathways has been described and
our data suggests a role for FBXW7 in the S1P-mTOR
axis [34, 35]. Two representative examples of genes
upregulated in vehicle treated Fbxw7+/−p53+/− mice, but
not rapamycin treated Fbxw7+/−p53+/− mice are shown in
Figure 2D. Significant upstream transcriptional regulators
include TP53, TP73 and CCND1 (Table 1, Supplementary
Table S2; p < 1.83E-05). These results indicate that
radiation induced tumors that arise in a Fbxw7+/−p53+/−
background exhibit decreased latency mediated at least in
part through increased cell proliferation mechanisms, and
temporal rapamycin treatment delayed tumor development
through the inhibition of cell proliferation pathways. We
next addressed how rapamycin treatment after radiation
exposure can alter tumor transcript profiles.

We previously showed that loss of a single copy
of the tumor suppressor Fbxw7 significantly reduced
radiation-induced tumor latency in p53+/− mice [19].
Among its functions, depletion of FBXW7 alleviates
the inhibitory effect on mTOR signaling resulting in
activation of the mTOR pathway. Our previous study
showed that temporal inhibition of mTOR by rapamycin
significantly delayed tumor development in Fbxw7/p53
double heterozygous (Fbxw7+/−p53+/−) mice [31]. To
determine the molecular mechanisms associated with
these observations we transcriptionally profiled radiationinduced thymic lymphomas from rapamycin (n = 11)
and vehicle (n = 13) treated Fbxw7+/−p53+/− mice or
from vehicle treated p53 single heterozygous (p53+/−)
mice (n = 8) (Figure 1A; Supplementary Table S1 for
experimental details). In comparison to transcriptome
of thymic lymphomas from p53+/− mice, we found
1215 and 1235 mapped genes differentially expressed in
thymic lymphomas from vehicle and rapamycin treated
Fbxw7+/−p53+/− mice respectively (fold-change 1.3;
p < 0.05, Figure 1A), with 259 overlapping genes that
were differentially expressed independent of rapamycin
treatment (Figure 1A and 1B). We next computationally
mapped the overlapping 259 transcripts to biological
functions, pathways and upstream transcriptional
regulators using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA). As
expected, gene interaction network analyses confirmed
downregulation of Fbxw7 expression in Fbxw7+/− mice
(Figure 1C and 1E). Interestingly, we also observed
significant upregulation of SREBF2 (Figure 1C and 1E).
We validated these findings using an independent tumor
set from rapamycin treated p53 single heterozygous
(p53+/−) mice (n = 8). When we combined the transcript
data from this tumor set with the transcript data of
thymic lymphomas from vehicle treated p53+/− mice (n
= 8) significant fold-changes were found for FBXW7,
SREBF2 and HMGCS1 (Figure 1E) confirming our
results. Consistent with this observation, we found
significant enrichment of genes regulated by SREBF1 and
2 (Table 1, Supplementary Table S2; p < 7.22E-08) and
significant enrichment of pathways involved in cholesterol
metabolism (Figure 1D; Supplementary Table S2).

Upregulation of integrated stress response
genes in the tumors from rapamycin treated
Fbxw7+/−p53+/− mice
We analyzed transcript profiles of tumors isolated
from rapamycin treated Fbxw7+/−p53+/− mice. We found
976 transcripts differentially expressed in rapamycin treated
Fbxw7+/−p53+/− thymic lymphomas when compared to
p53+/− tumors (Figure 1A). We observed that the cell cycle
enrichment observed in vehicle treated mice was not present
in tumors that arose in rapamycin treated mice during tumor
development. In addition, we observed a shift in upstream
transcriptional regulators (Table 1, Supplementary Table
S2). We observed significant enrichment of genes regulated
by ATF4 and DDIT3 in tumors from rapamycin treated
mice (Figure 3; Table 1, Supplementary Table S2). These
regulators were not associated with transcript levels in
vehicle treated mice. ATF4 and DDIT3 upregulation are
indicative of activation of the integrated stress response

to accumulation of unfolded proteins in the endoplasmic
reticulum, amino acid starvation or oxidants. To determine
whether this response was dependent on loss of Fbxw7,
we compared transcript profiles of tumors from rapamycin
treated Fbxw7+/−p53+/− mice and rapamycin treated
p53+/− mice. We found that the transcriptional regulators
ATF4 and DDIT3 were not significantly associated with
transcript levels in tumors of rapamycin treated p53+/−
mice (Table 1, Supplementary Table S2) indicating that the

ATF4/DDIT3 regulated transcript response is dependent on
rapamycin exposure in an environment depleted of Fbxw7.

FBXW7 gene signatures are associated with
clinical outcome in human cancer
A cross-cancer analysis (cBioPortal, The Cancer
Genome Atlas) revealed that FBXW7 is frequently altered
in many cancer types including colon, breast and lung.

Loss of one copy of FBXW7 accounted for the majority of
alterations. We investigated if genes whose expression in
human tumors correlated with FBXW7 expression showed
overlap with the genes deregulated in the Fbxw7+/−p53+/−
mouse thymic lymphomas. Using cBioPortal, we generated
three lists consisting of 1103, 698 and 672 genes of which
expression levels positively correlated with FBXW7
expression in human colorectal adenocarcinoma, breast
cancer and lung adenocarcinoma, respectively [36, 37].
Interestingly, we observed a very significant overlap
between genes that are deregulated in Fbxw7+/−/p53+/−
mouse tumors and those that are co-expressed with FBXW7
in colon (66 genes; p = 3.3E-13), breast (36 genes; p = 1.0E05) and lung cancer (30 genes; p = 9.5E-05), respectively
(Figure 4A, 4C, and 4E). Given the role of FBXW7 as a
tumor suppressor gene we predicted that higher expression
of these overlapping and FBXW7 positively correlated
genes would have a good prognosis for patients. We tested
the association of transcript levels for the corresponding
FBXW7 gene signatures in colon, breast and lung cancer
patients, for which information on disease-free survival
and gene expression was available [38–40]. We defined

a score of FBXW7 gene signature for each patient as the
sum of the normalized expression intensities of all genes
in each signature. We then examined whether there was
a difference in disease free survival for the top 25% of
patients with highest and bottom 25% patients with lowest
sum expression. For all three tumor types, we observed that
patients with a higher score (top 25%) had significantly
increased survival compared to patients with a low score
(bottom 25%) (Figure 4B, 4D, and 4F). Taken together, our
results reinforce the role of FBXW7 as a tumor suppressor
and indicate that FBXW7 is a viable target for therapeutic
intervention.

DISCUSSION
In a mouse model of radiation-induced carcinogenesis
we showed that loss of a single copy of the tumor
suppressor FBXW7 significantly reduced tumor latency and
that temporal inhibition of mTOR pathway was sufficient
to suppress tumor development contributed by Fbxw7 loss
in this model, suggesting that Fbxw7-mTOR pathway plays
a major role. Here we used transcript profiling of radiation

induced thymic lymphomas to investigate the molecular
signaling pathways that contribute to tumorigenesis in
Fbxw7 heterozygous mice and their dependence on mTOR.
We observed significant enrichment of genes regulated
by SREBF1 and 2 (sterol regulatory element binding
transcription factors 1 and 2; SREBP1, SREBP2). The
FBXW7-SREBF axis has been proposed in mouse models
of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease [32, 33]. In this study
FBXW7 and SREBF1 were negatively correlated consistent
with our observation of increased expression of SREBF1
and downstream target genes in thymic lymphomas of
FBXW7 heterozygous mice. Phosphorylation of SREBF
has been shown to create a recognition site for FBXW7 and
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

subsequent degradation by the multiprotein SCF complex
[41]. Our results suggest that loss of FBXW7 results in
increased activity of SREBF contributing to tumorigenesis.
Interestingly, accumulating evidence has indicated that
SREBF1 proteins regulate tumorigenesis [42–45]. In
pancreatic cancer, increased expression of SREBF1 was
predictive of poor prognosis and depletion of SREBF1
resulted in suppression of tumor growth [46]. Rapamycin
treatment of cultured human adipocytes resulted in downregulation of gene expression of SREBF1 [47] suggesting
that the tumor promoting effects of the FBXW7-SREBF
axis is dependent on mTOR. Temporal inhibition of mTOR
by rapamycin in our mouse model resulted in delayed

In Fbxw7 heterozygous mice temporally treated
by rapamycin for ten consecutive weeks after radiation
exposure, we observed significant enrichment and
upregulation of ATF4 and DDIT3 indicative of activation
of the integrated stress response. Numerous challenges
to the endoplasmatic reticulum (ER) can cause the
accumulation of unfolded proteins in the ER resulting in
the unfolded protein response (UPR). Challenges include

tumor latency. Our transcript analyses, however, did show
the tendency to downregulation of SREBF1 in tumors from
Fbxw7 heterozygous mice treated with rapamycin compared
to vehicle control treated tumors (Figure 1D middle panel).
Taken together, our results provide further evidence for a
role of SREBF proteins in tumorigenesis through loss of
FBXW7 and indicates SREBF as a target for therapeutic
intervention in tumors with FBXW7 deregulation.

anoxia, amino acid starvation, glucose deprivation and
oxidants. The initial response to this stress is to restore
homeostasis promoting cell survival by increasing
expression of genes involved in protein folding and
degradation of misfolded proteins. When the initial
response fails, prolonged ER stress can result in apoptosis.
Our study shows upregulation of ATF4, one of the
mediating transcription factors of the UPR. Tumors often
grow under suboptimal conditions in an environment low
in oxygen and nutrients. Thus, it may not be surprising
that adaptation to ER stress is a determinant of tumor
progression [48, 49]. It should be noted that tumors of
Fbxw7 wild type, but otherwise isogenic mice concurrently
treated with rapamycin did not exhibit enrichment of this
response suggesting cross-talk between FBXW7 and
mTOR and ER stress. Recently, bidirectional cross talk
between mTOR and the UPR have been suggested with
mTOR functioning both upstream and downstream of ER
stress signals [50–52]. Inhibition of mTOR for example
increases cell viability during ER stress [53, 54]. Our data
suggests that temporal inhibition of mTOR by rapamycin
during early tumor development may result in persistent
ER stress in tumors that develop long after rapamycin
treatment. Further research is needed to clarify the role of
FBXW7 in the UPR and tumor development.

Data normalization was performed using
GeneSpring GX12.5 (Agilent Technologies). Signal
intensities for each probe were normalized to the 75th
percentile without baseline transformation. Genes that
were differentially expressed in thymic lymphomas
between vehicle and rapamycin treated Fbxw7+/−p53+/−
mice and p53+/− mice were identified by the unpaired
Student’s t-test with a p-value cut-off of less than 0.05
and a fold change criteria of more than 1.3. Gene lists
were annotated with biological functions using Ingenuity
Pathway Analysis (IPA), KEGG pathway analysis (http://
bioinfo.vanderbilt.edu/webgestalt/) and DAVID GO gene
ontology (http://david.abcc.ncifcrf.gov/; p ≤ 0.05).

Human cancer datasets and survival analysis
The list of genes that are co-expressed with FBXW7
in colon, lung and breast cancer were obtained from the
TCGA study at cBioPortal. The overlap between FBXW7
co-expressed genes and the set of genes deregulated in
Fbxw7+/−/p53+/− mouse tumors was used to test for
association with disease-free survival. Gene expression
microarray datasets of colon, lung and breast cancer
for which disease-free survival was available were
downloaded from the NCBI GEO website. Kaplan-Meier
plots were constructed and a long-rank test was used
to determine differences among disease free survival
according to a score of FBXW7 gene signature for each
patient as the sum of the normalized expression intensities
of all genes in each signature.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Mice, irradiation and rapamycin treatment
All animal experiments were performed at
Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory and the study
was carried out in strict accordance with the Guide
for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the
National Institutes of Health. The animal use protocol
was approved by the Animal Welfare and Research
Committee of the Lawrence Berkeley National
Laboratory. Detailed methods were described previously
[31]. Briefly, p53+/− and p53+/ − Fbxw7+/− mice were
generated by crossing p53−/− mice with Fbxw7+/− mice.
At 5 weeks of age, mice were exposed whole-body to a
single dose of 4 Gy X-ray irradiation. Mice were divided
randomly into two groups and treated with rapamycin or
placebo [31].
