Phosphorylation and Renal Tumor Growth in Response to
Pharmacologic Inhibition of the PI3K–AKT Pathway

Abstract
The PI3K–AKT pathway is hyperactivated in many human cancers, and several drugs to inhibit this pathway,
including the PI3K/mTOR dual inhibitor NVP-BEZ235, are currently being tested in various preclinical and
clinical trials. It has been shown that pharmacologic inhibition of the PI3K–AKT pathway results in feedback
activation of other oncogenic signaling pathways, which likely will limit the clinical utilization of these inhibitors
in cancer treatment. However, the underlying mechanisms of such feedback regulation remain incompletely
understood. The PI3K–AKT pathway is a validated therapeutic target in renal cell carcinoma (RCC). Here, we
show that FoxO transcription factors serve to promote AKT phosphorylation at Ser473 in response to NVPBEZ235 treatment in renal cancer cells. Inactivation of FoxO attenuated NVP-BEZ235–induced AKT Ser473
phosphorylation and rendered renal cancer cells more susceptible to NVP-BEZ235–mediated cell growth
suppression in vitro and tumor shrinkage in vivo. Mechanistically, we showed that FoxOs upregulated the
expression of Rictor, an essential component of MTOR complex 2, in response to NVP-BEZ235 treatment and
revealed that Rictor is a key downstream target of FoxOs in NVP-BEZ235–mediated feedback regulation. Finally,
we show that FoxOs similarly modulate the feedback response on AKT Ser473 phosphorylation and renal tumor
growth by other phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) or AKT inhibitor treatment. Together, our study reveals a novel
mechanism of PI3K–AKT inhibition-mediated feedback regulation and may identify FoxO as a novel biomarker
to stratify patients with RCC for PI3K or AKT inhibitor treatment, or a novel therapeutic target to synergize with
PI3K–AKT inhibition in RCC treatment. Cancer Res; 74(6); 1682–93. 2014 AACR.

Introduction
The PI3K–AKT signaling pathway plays a key role in linking
the extracellular growth factor stimulation to various cellular
processes, including cell growth, proliferation, survival, and
angiogenesis (1, 2). Activation of phosphoinositide 3-kinase
(PI3K) by growth factor binding to receptor tyrosine kinases
(RTK) results in phosphorylation of plasma membrane phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) to form PIP3. Subsequently, PIP3 recruits other downstream effector proteins to
the plasma membrane, prominent among which is the serine/
threonine kinase AKT. At the plasma membrane, AKT is

further activated through phosphorylation of Thr308 and
Ser473 by PDK1 and mTOR complex 2 (mTORC2). Once fully
activated, AKT phosphorylates other target proteins, including
the TSC1–TSC2 complex, and FoxOs (3). The TSC1–TSC2
complex inhibits mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1), which functions
to promote protein synthesis and cell growth. AKT-mediated
phosphorylation of TSC2 inhibits the TSC1–TSC2 complex
function, and thus activates mTORC1 signaling (4). FoxO
transcription factors mainly function to promote cell-cycle
arrest and apoptosis via regulation of diverse arrays of transcription targets. AKT phosphorylation of FoxOs leads to FoxO
sequestration in the cytoplasm and inactivates their transcription activities (5–8). Aberrant activation of this signaling
network has been observed in virtually all human cancers
(9–12). In particular relevance to this study, the recent data
from The Cancer Genome Atlas project revealed that the PI3K–
AKT pathway is altered in around 30% of renal cell carcinomas
(RCC; ref. 13).
RCC accounts for 3% of all malignancies in adults, and ranks
among the top ten cancers in the United States (14, 15).
Traditional chemotherapy, hormonal therapy, or radiation is
not effective in the treatment of advanced RCC. mTOR is a
validated therapeutic target in RCC, as mTORC1 hyperactivation has been observed in most human RCC samples (16–18),
and several clinical trials established the clinical beneﬁt of
mTORC1 inhibitors (19–21). However, the clinical response of

FoxOs Regulate Renal Tumor Suppression by PI3K–AKT Inhibition

RCC to mTOR inhibition has been modest, and most patients
with RCC receiving mTOR inhibitor treatment eventually
developed resistance (19–21), which may be associated with
mTORC1-mediated feedback regulation of the upstream PI3K–
AKT pathway. A number of studies have shown that, although
activated PI3K–AKT signaling promotes mTORC1 activation,
mTORC1 hyperactivation also leads to feedback shutoff of the
PI3K–AKT signaling (22–27). These observations suggest that
mTOR inhibitor treatment alone, while inhibiting mTORC1mediated protein synthesis and cell growth, also stimulates
PI3K–AKT-dependent survival and cell-cycle entry, which
might explain the relatively moderate impact of mTOR inhibitor in treating RCC (28).
These observations prompted ideas for inhibiting the
upstream PI3K–AKT pathway in the treatment of RCC as
well as other cancers (29). Indeed, a recent study (30) showed
that NVP-BEZ235, a PI3K and mTOR dual inhibitor (31),
induced more potent growth arrest and apoptotic responses
in RCC cells than did rapamycin, an mTOR inhibitor. Currently, NVP-BEZ235, or other drugs to inhibit the PI3K–AKT
pathway, including BKM120 and MK-2206, is being tested in
various RCC clinical trials. However, several studies conducted in the context of other cancers revealed that pharmacologic inhibition of the PI3K–AKT pathway induced new
compensatory activation of other oncogenic pathways,
including FoxO-mediated upregulation of RTK expression,
which might limit the clinical utilization of these inhibitors
in cancer treatment (32–37). However, whether and how
PI3K–AKT inhibition-mediated feedback regulation operates
in RCC remains undeﬁned.
In this study, utilizing mouse embryonic ﬁbroblasts (MEF)
and various renal cancer cells as model system, we investigated the underlying mechanisms of FoxO-mediated feedback regulation and the role of FoxOs in renal tumor
development in response to PI3K–AKT inhibition. We identify a novel feedback mechanism that FoxOs promote PI3K–
AKT inhibition-induced AKT Ser473 phosphorylation likely
via transcriptional upregulation of Rictor. Inactivation of
FoxOs results in more potent cell or tumor growth inhibition
in response to PI3K–AKT inhibition. These ﬁndings have
important implications on the treatment strategies of RCC
as well as other cancers.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture studies
786-O, UOK101, and RCC4 are human RCC cells, and are
described in our previous publication (18). These renal cancer
cells and human embryonic kidney cell line, HEK293T, were
obtained from American Type Culture Collection, and passaged for less than 6 months after receipt. They are cultured in
Dulbecco's Modiﬁed Eagle Medium (DMEM) þ 10% FBS.
Lentiviruses or retroviruses were produced in HEK293T cells
with packing mix (ViraPower Lentiviral Expression System,
Invitrogen) and used to infect target cells as per manufacturer's
instruction. FoxO1/3/4 L/L, RosaCreERT2 MEFs (18) were
isolated from E14.5 embryos by standard methods. Primary
FoxO1/3/4 L/L, RosaCreERT2 MEFs were treated with 200
nmol/L 4-hydroxytamoxifen (4-OHT) or vehicle for 4 days

www.aacrjournals.org

and then shifted to normal medium (DMEM þ 10% FBS) after
4-OHT treatment, resulting in FoxO wild-type (WT) and
knockout (KO) MEFs. To measure apoptosis, the cells were
stained by Annexin V kit as per manufacturer's instruction
(BD Biosciences) and then subjected to ﬂuorescence-activated
cell sorting analysis. Cell growth assay was conducted as
described in our previous publication (18).
Reagents
Lentiviral short hairpin RNA (shRNA) vectors targeting
human FoxO1 and FoxO3 were described in our previous
publication (18). Rictor retroviral vector and Lentiviral shRNA
vector targeting human Rictor were described in the previous
publication (38). NVP-BEZ235 was purchased from LC Laboratories. BKM120 was ordered from ChemieTek. MK2206 was
ordered from Selleck. 4-OHT was purchased from Sigma. The
following antibodies were used in this study: Vinculin (Sigma),
FoxO1 (C29H4), FoxO3 (75D8), phospho-FOXO1(Thr24)/
FOXO3(Thr32), S6, Ser240/244 phospho-S6, Rictor, AKT,
Ser473 phospho-AKT, Thr308 phospho-AKT, GSK3, phospho-GSK3, cleaved caspase-3, Ki-67, and ERBB3 (all from Cell
Signaling Technology).
Immunoﬂuorescence
Cells were cultured in chamber slides overnight and ﬁxed
with 3.7% formaldehyde in PBS for 10 minutes, followed by
permeabilization with 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS for 10 minutes.
Cells were then blocked for nonspeciﬁc binding with 10% goat
serum in PBS and 0.1% Tween-20 (PBST), and incubated with
the antibody against FoxO1 (1:300; Cell Signaling Technology)
or FoxO3 (1:300; Cell Signaling Technology) for 1 hour at room
temperature, followed by incubation with Alexa Fluor 594 goat
anti-rabbit immunoglobulin G (1:1,000, Invitrogen, A11012) for
30 minutes at room temperature. Coverslips were mounted
on slides using antifade mounting medium with 40 ,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI). Immunoﬂuorescence images
were acquired on a Zeiss Axio Observer Z1 ﬂuorescence
microscope. For each channel, all images were acquired with
the same settings.
Western blot analysis and fractionation
Tissues were lysed with radioimmunoprecipitation assay
buffer (20 mmol/L Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mmol/L NaCl, 1%
Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 1 mmol/L EDTA,
0.1% SDS) containing complete mini protease inhibitors
(Roche) and phosphatase inhibitor cocktail (Calbiochem).
Cultured cells were lysed with NP40 buffer (150 mmol/L
sodium chloride, 1.0% NP-40, 50 mmol/L Tris, pH 8.0)
containing complete mini protease inhibitors (Roche) and
phosphatase inhibitor cocktail (Calbiochem). Western blot
analyses were obtained utilizing 20 to 40 mg of lysate protein.
Fractionation of nuclear and cytoplasmic proteins was done
by using the NE-PER Nuclear and Cytoplasmic Extraction Kit
(Thermo) according to the manufacturer's protocol. After
fractionation, 30 mg of protein was used for Western blot
analysis of FoxOs in the cytoplasm and nucleus. a-Tubulin
and lamin-A were used as markers of cytoplasm and the
nucleus, respectively.

Quantitative real-time PCR and ChIP analysis
Total RNA was extracted from cells using RNeasy (Qiagen)
and ﬁrst-strand cDNA was prepared with High Capacity cDNA
Reverse Transcription Kit (Applied Biosystems, ABI). Real-time
PCR was performed using QuantiTect SYBR Green PCR kit
(Qiagen) or TaqMan Universal PCR Master Mix (ABI), and was
run on Stratagene MX3000P. Chromatin immunoprecipitation
(ChIP) experiment was performed using EZ-ChIP Kit (Chemicon) as per the manufacturer's instructions. The primer
sequences used in this study are described in Supplementary
Experimental Procedures.
Xenograft model
786-O cells infected with either control shRNA or FoxO1/
FoxO3 shRNA were injected subcutaneously into nude mice.
Once the tumor xenografts reached around 100 mm3, mice
were randomized into different groups (n ¼ 5/group) and
treated once daily by gavage with vehicle, NVP-BEZ235,
BKM120, or MK-2206 (30 mg/kg/d). Drugs were solubilized
in one volume of N-methylpyrrolidone (Sigma) and further
diluted in nine volumes of PEG 300 (Sigma). Bidimensional
tumor measurements were taken, mice were sacriﬁced after 20
days of treatment, and the tumors were excised for further
experiments.
Histology and immunohistochemistry
Tumor samples were ﬁxed in 10% neutral-buffered formalin
(Sigma) overnight, and washed once with 1 PBS and then
transferred into 70% ethanol and stored at 4 C. Tissues were
processed by ethanol dehydration and embedded in parafﬁn by
Histology Core Laboratory (MD Anderson Cancer Center,
Houston, TX) according to standard protocols. Sections (5
mm) were prepared for antibody detection and hematoxylin
and eosin staining. Immunohistochemical analysis was performed as previously described (18). The protein signal was
quantiﬁed by Image-pro plus 6.0 software (Media Cybernetics).
The immunoreactive signal, corresponding to the target
expression level, was calculated on the basis of the average
staining intensity and the percentage of positively stained cells.

Results
NVP-BEZ235 treatment-induced AKT Ser473
phosphorylation is signiﬁcantly compromised in
FoxO-deﬁcient cells
Our previous study showed that reactivation of FoxO1 or
FoxO3 in renal cancer cells induced potent cell-cycle arrest
and apoptosis (18). Paradoxically, in the same cell lines, we
observed that FoxO reactivation resulted in signiﬁcantly
increased phosphorylation of AKT (data not shown).
Because PI3K inhibition generally leads to FoxO activation,
we reasoned that FoxOs may also play a role in PI3K
inhibition-induced AKT reactivation. We ﬁrst tested this
hypothesis in the matched FoxO WT and KO MEFs generated by transient 4OHT or vehicle treatment of FoxO1/3/4 L/
L, Rosa26-CreERT2 MEFs. Consistent with ﬁndings described
in other cancer cell lines (33, 35), we observed that treatment
with 50 nmol/L NVP-BEZ235, a PI3K/mTOR dual inhibitor,
in WT MEFs led to transient decrease of AKT Ser473

1684

phosphorylation followed by resurgence of AKT Ser473
phosphorylation at later time points (Fig. 1A). NVP-BEZ235
treatment also signiﬁcantly decreased the phosphorylation
levels of AKT substrates such as FoxO and GSK3 (Fig. 1B),
and promoted FoxO translocation from cytoplasm to nucleus (Supplementary Fig. S1), conﬁrming the inhibition of the
PI3K–AKT pathway by NVP-BEZ235. Mirroring the resurgence of AKT Ser473 phosphorylation, the phosphorylation
levels of FoxO and GSK3 also resurged at later time points
upon NVP-BEZ235 treatment (Fig. 1B).
Notably, although FoxO deletion in MEFs did not signiﬁcantly affect the basal level of AKT Ser473 phosphorylation,
NVP-BEZ235–induced resurgence of AKT Ser473 phosphorylation as well as GSK3 phosphorylation at later time points was
signiﬁcantly reduced in FoxO KO MEFs (Fig. 1A and B and
Supplementary Fig. S2A). A dose-dependent experiment at 24
hours after NVP-BEZ235 treatment revealed that NVP-BEZ235
treatment increased AKT Ser473 phosphorylation at relatively
low dosages (less than 100 nmol/L) in WT MEFs, and the
increased AKT Ser473 phosphorylation was signiﬁcantly compromised in FoxO KO MEFs (Fig. 1C). In line with these data
from murine system, further experiments in human renal
cancer cells (Fig. 1D and E), including UOK101 (with high
expression of FoxO3 and low FoxO1 expression) and 786-O
cells (with high expression of both FoxO1 and FoxO3), conﬁrmed that knockdown of FoxOs similarly alleviated NVPBEZ235–induced AKT Ser473 phosphorylation.
We also examined the phosphorylation status of several
other key signaling molecules in the same experimental conditions. FoxO deletion or knockdown did not signiﬁcantly affect
the levels of S6 phosphorylation under NVP-BEZ235 treatment,
suggesting that FoxOs did not affect NVP-BEZ235 inhibition of
mTORC1 (Fig. 1A–E). We found that, in MEFs, 50 nmol/L NVPBEZ235 treatment did not lead to the initial suppression of
AKT Ser308 phosphorylation (Fig. 1A and Supplementary
Fig. S1B), whereas in UOK101 cells, the kinetics of AKT Thr308
phosphorylation in response to NVP-BEZ235 treatment is
similar to that of AKT Ser473 phosphorylation with initial
suppression followed by resurgence at later time points
(Fig. 1D). Regardless of the differential response of AKT Ser308
phosphorylation in different cell lines, we found that FoxO
deﬁciency did not affect AKT Ser308 phosphorylation under
NVP-BEZ235 treatment (Fig. 1A and D). Finally, consistent with
previous reports in other cell lines (33), NVP-BEZ235 treatment
increased extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) phosphorylation, and FoxO deﬁciency moderately increased ERK
phosphorylation under NVP-BEZ235 treatment (Fig. 1A and C),
which may relate to the documented feedback regulation
between the AKT and ERK pathways. Together, our data reveal
that FoxOs speciﬁcally promote AKT Ser473 phosphorylation
under NVP-BEZ235 treatment, and NVP-BEZ235 treatmentinduced AKT Ser473 phosphorylation is signiﬁcantly compromised in FoxO-deﬁcient cells.
FoxO deﬁciency promotes cell proliferation suppression
and cell death induction under NVP-BEZ235 treatment
AKT activation plays a major role in promoting cell proliferation and survival (3). We thus examined the impact of FoxO

deﬁciency on cell proliferation and survival under NVPBEZ235 treatment. As shown in Fig. 2A, FoxO deletion rendered
MEFs more sensitive to NVP-BEZ235–induced cell proliferation suppression. Although NVP-BEZ235 treatment at 50
nmol/L concentration did not induce obvious apoptosis in
WT MEFs, it signiﬁcantly increased apoptosis in FoxO KO
MEFs (Fig. 2B). It is important to note that, when applied at
very high dosage (more than 250 nmol/L), NVP-BEZ235 very
potently suppressed cell proliferation, and FoxO deﬁciency did
not affect high-dose NVP-BEZ235 treatment-induced cell proliferation arrest (Supplementary Fig. S3). In line with these data
from MEFs, further experiments conﬁrmed that knockdown of
FoxOs in various human renal cancer cells, although modestly
increasing cell proliferation, led to more potent cell proliferation suppression and apoptosis induction compared with
control shRNA-infected cells under NVP-BEZ235 treatment
(Fig. 2C–F). Together, our data strongly suggest that FoxO
deﬁciency promotes cell proliferation suppression and apoptosis induction in response to NVP-BEZ235 treatment, thus
rendering renal cancer cells more susceptible to NVP-BEZ235
treatment.

FoxO deﬁciency potentiates NVP-BEZ235–induced renal
tumor suppression in vivo
The data presented above in cell line studies prompted us to
further examine the roles of FoxOs in renal tumor growth in
response to NVP-BEZ235 treatment in vivo using the xenograft
model. To this end, we injected the same amount of 786-O cells
infected with either FoxO1/3 shRNA or control shRNA into
nude mice. Once the tumor xenografts reached 100 mm3,
mice were treated once daily with vehicle or NVP-BEZ235
(30 mg/kg/d) for additional 20 days, and the tumor samples
were collected for various analyses at the endpoint. In line with
the data from in vitro analyses (Fig. 2F), our in vivo experiments
revealed that, although FoxO knockdown moderately increased tumor size and weight in vivo, more dramatic decline
in tumor size and weight were observed in FoxO knockdown
tumor group compared with control group with NVP-BEZ235
treatment (Fig. 3A–C).
Further analyses of the tumor samples by Western
blotting (Fig. 3D) and immunohistochemical experiments
(Fig. 3E and F) conﬁrmed that NVP-BEZ235 signiﬁcantly
induced AKT Ser473 phosphorylation in renal tumor

samples obtained at endpoint (20 days after NVP-BEZ235
treatment), and that FoxO knockdown alleviated the
increase of AKT Ser473 phosphorylation induced by
NVP-BEZ235 treatment in tumors. FoxO knockdown also
potentiated NVP-NEZ235 treatment-induced apoptosis and
cell-cycle arrest in renal tumors, as evidenced by cleaved
caspase-3 and Ki-67 immunohistochemical analyses (Fig.
3E and F). It should be pointed out that FoxO knockdown
did not affect NVP-BEZ235–induced mTORC1 inactivation
as evidenced by S6 phosphorylation (Fig. 3D–F), which is
consistent with the in vitro data (Fig. 1A and C). Collectively, our data strongly suggest that, under NVP-BEZ235
treatment, FoxOs promote renal tumor growth likely
through its upregulation of AKT Ser473 phosphorylation,
and FoxO deﬁciency potentiates PI3K inhibition-induced
renal tumor suppression in vivo.

FoxOs upregulate Rictor expression under NVP-BEZ235
treatment
Both in vitro and in vivo studies presented above prompted
us to further dissect the underlying mechanisms by which
FoxOs regulate AKT Ser473 phosphorylation under NVPBEZ235 treatment. Previous studies showed that FoxOs mediate AKT or PI3K inhibition-induced upregulation of certain
RTKs, particularly ERBB3, in breast cancer cells (36), which
likely relates to FoxO-mediated AKT reactivation as shown in
our studies. However, we found that there was no appreciable
difference of ERBB3 expression levels between FoxO WT and
FoxO KO MEFs (Fig. 4A).
Because our data showed that FoxOs regulate AKT Ser473
phosphorylation, but not AKT Ser308 phosphorylation or S6
phosphorylation, in response to NVP-BEZ235 treatment (Fig.
1A–E), we reason that FoxOs may speciﬁcally regulate

mTORC2 function under NVP-BEZ235 treatment, as
mTORC2 is responsible for AKT Ser473 phosphorylation
(38). To this end, we examined the expression levels of
mTORC2 components under NVP-BEZ235 treatment. These
analyses revealed that NVP-BEZ235 treatment signiﬁcantly
induced the expression of Rictor, an essential component of
mTORC2, in WT MEFs, and that FoxO deletion in MEFs
abolished NVP-BEZ235–induced Rictor expression (Fig. 4A
and B). In line with this, FoxO knockdown attenuated NVPBEZ235–induced Rictor expression in both renal cancer cells
in vitro (Fig. 4C and D) and xenograft renal tumor samples in
vivo (Fig. 4E). FoxO knockdown did not affect ERBB3 expression in response to NVP-BEZ235 treatment in renal cancer

cells (Fig. 4C and D). Finally, ChIP analysis documented that
endogenous FoxO1 and FoxO3 can directly bind to the FoxObinding element identiﬁed in Rictor promoter region, and
NVP-BEZ235 treatment signiﬁcantly increased FoxO1/3
binding to FoxO-binding element in Rictor promoter (Fig.
4F and G). Taken together, our data suggest that, in response
to NVP-BEZ235 treatment, FoxOs directly bind to Rictor
promoter and upregulate Rictor expression, which likely is
responsible for the resurgence of AKT Ser473 phosphorylation at later time points under NVP-BEZ235 treatment. Our
data are also consistent with a previous report showing that
overexpression of FoxO is sufﬁcient to induce Rictor expression (39).

FoxOs Regulate Renal Tumor Suppression by PI3K–AKT Inhibition

Rictor mediates FoxO regulation of AKT Ser473
phosphorylation, cell proliferation, and cell survival in
response to NVP-BEZ235 treatment
Next we studied whether Rictor plays any causal role in FoxO
function in PI3K inhibition-mediated feedback regulation. To
this end, we examined whether reexpression of Rictor in FoxOdeﬁcient cells would rescue the decrease of AKT Ser473
phosphorylation, cell proliferation and survival under NVPBEZ235 treatment. As shown in Fig. 5A, reexpression of Rictor
in FoxO KO cells restored AKT Ser473 phosphorylation to WT
level under NVP-BEZ235 treatment. As expected, reexpression
of Rictor did not affect AKT Ser308 phosphorylation (Fig. 5A).
Accordingly, although reexpression of Rictor in FoxO KO cells
did not affect cell proliferation or apoptosis under vehicle

treatment condition, Rictor reexpression signiﬁcantly rescued
NVP-BEZ235–induced cell proliferation suppression and apoptosis induction phenotypes observed in FoxO KO cells (Fig. 5B
and C). In addition, we showed that knockdown of Rictor in
both UOK101 and 786-O renal cancer cells potentiated cell
proliferation suppression and cell death induction under NVPBEZ235 treatment (Supplementary Fig. S4). Together, our data
strongly suggest that Rictor is at least one key downstream
target of FoxOs to mediate NVP-BEZ235–induced feedback
regulation.
FoxOs modulate the feedback response on AKT Ser473
phosphorylation and renal tumor growth by other PI3K
or AKT inhibitors
In our data presented above, we use NVP-BEZ235 as a
pharmacologic means to inhibit the PI3K–AKT pathway. To
rule out the possibility that the effect is speciﬁc to NVPBEZ235, we also extended our experiments to other PI3K or
AKT inhibitors, including BKM120 (a pan-PI3K inhibitor) and
MK-2206 (an AKT inhibitor). First, we showed that FoxO KO
cells also exhibited signiﬁcantly reduced AKT Ser473 phosphorylation under the treatment of BKM120 (Fig. 6A) or MK2206 (Fig. 6B). In addition, our data from different cell lines,
including MEFs and renal cancer cells, showed that FoxO
deﬁciency similarly potentiated cell proliferation suppression
and cell death induction in response to either BKM120 to MK2206 treatment (Fig. 6C–J). Finally, we also examined the roles
of FoxOs in renal tumor growth in response to BKM120 or MK2206 treatment in vivo using the similar xenograft model
described above. As shown in Fig. 7A–F, our data showed that
FoxO knockdown potentiated BKM120 or MK-2206 treatmentinduced renal tumor suppression in vivo, which aligns well with
NVP-BEZ235 treatment data (Fig. 3A–C). Together, our data
strongly suggest that FoxO-mediated feedback regulation
described here results from the pharmacologic inhibition of
the PI3K–AKT pathway rather than a speciﬁc effect of NVPBEZ235 treatment.

Discussion

Figure 5. Rictor mediates FoxO regulation of AKT Ser473
phosphorylation, cell proliferation, and cell survival in response to
NVP-BEZ235 treatment. A, FoxO WT and KO MEFs with stable
expression of either empty vector (EV) or Rictor were treated with 0 or 50
nmol/L NVP-BEZ235 for 24 hours; cell lysates were then analyzed by
Western blotting. B, FoxO WT and KO MEFs with stable
expression of either empty vector or Rictor were treated with 0 or 50 nmol/L
NVP-BEZ235 for different days as indicated and subjected to cell
proliferation analysis. C, FoxO WT and KO MEFs with stable
expression of either empty vector or Rictor were treated with 0 or 50 nmol/L
NVP-BEZ235 for 24 hours. The apoptosis rates of the cells were
then detected by Annexin V staining assay.

The PI3K–AKT–mTOR pathway is hyperactivated in many
human cancers, including RCC. The moderate clinical beneﬁt
of the mTOR inhibitor observed in several human cancer
clinical trials and the mTORC1 inhibition-mediated feedback
activation of PI3K–AKT have prompted ideas for inhibiting the
upstream PI3K–AKT in cancer treatment (28). However, the
relief of feedback regulation and the resulting activation of
other oncogenic signaling pathways caused by PI3K–AKT
inhibition likely will limit the clinical utilization of such
inhibitors in cancer treatment.
Using NVP-BEZ235 as a pharmacologic approach to inhibit
PI3K, our study reveals a novel mechanism of PI3K inhibitioninduced feedback regulation in RCC cells, which involves
FoxO-mediated Rictor upregulation and AKT reactivation via
Ser473 phosphorylation. Speciﬁcally, our data show that,
although short-term treatment of NVP-BEZ235 leads to immediate PI3K–AKT inactivation and FoxO activation, long-term
treatment of NVP-BEZ235 leads to FoxO binding to Rictor

promoter and upregulation of Rictor expression, resulting in
the resurgence of AKT Ser473 phosphorylation likely via activation of mTORC2. Because NVP-BEZ235 is a PI3K/mTOR dual
inhibitor, it should also inhibit mTORC2. However, NVPBEZ235 treatment at low dosage (such as 50 nmol/L) likely
only partially inhibits the activity of mTORC2 (as well as PI3K).
We propose that NVP-BEZ235–induced Rictor upregulation
will offset the partial inhibitory effect of NVP-BEZ235 on
mTORC2, leading to resurgence of AKT Ser473 phosphorylation at later time points. When applied at very high dosage
(more than 250 nmol/L), we reason that the inhibitory effect of
NVP-BEZ235 on mTORC2 and PI3K is so potent that Rictor
upregulation will not be enough to offset it. In line with this
model, NVP-BEZ235–induced resurgence of AKT Ser473 phosphorylation was only observed at relatively low dosages of
NVP-BEZ235 (see Fig. 1C). In addition, the effect of FoxO
deﬁciency on NVP-BEZ235–induced renal cancer growth sup-

1690

Cancer Res; 74(6) March 15, 2014

pression was only observed at relatively low dosages of NVPBEZ235 (compare Fig. 2A with Supplementary Fig. S3). Because
drug treatment at high dosages is generally toxic to patients
with cancer, the observation from our study focusing on low
dosages is likely to be of clinical relevance. Finally, we extend
our data to other PI3K or AKT inhibitors, suggesting that FoxOmediated feedback regulation described here likely results
from the pharmacologic inhibition of the PI3K–AKT pathway.
Whether this mechanism contributes to the tumor recurrence
in patients with renal cancer receiving PI3K or AKT inhibitor
treatment awaits further investigation in the future clinical
trials.
Our data showed that FoxOs function to promote cell
proliferation and survival under pharmacologic inhibition of
the PI3K–AKT pathway, which is different from the antiproliferative and proapoptotic function FoxOs exert under
other stress conditions (5). Thus, FoxOs could play very

different functions by regulating different sets of transcriptional targets under different cell lineages or stimuli, which
is in line with a previous report (40). Consistent with this, we
found that FoxO deﬁciency did not affect the expression
levels of FoxO targets mediating apoptosis response, such as
Bim and p27, under NVP-BEZ235 treatment (Supplementary
Fig. S5).
Our data from both gain-of-function (Rictor reexpression
in FoxO-deﬁcient cells) and loss-of-function (Rictor knockdown in FoxO-proﬁcient cells) experiments identiﬁed Rictor as an important downstream target of FoxO to mediate
PI3K inhibition-induced feedback. It should be pointed out
that moderate overexpression of Rictor in FoxO KO cells
did not signiﬁcantly increase AKT Ser473 phosphorylation
under vehicle treatment condition (Fig. 5A), suggesting
that NVP-BEZ235-induced AKT Ser473 phosphorylation
may involve Rictor and other factors (which may be
regulated by PI3K inhibition via FoxO-independent
mechanisms). Clearly, the response to pharmacologic inhi-

www.aacrjournals.org

bition of the PI3K–AKT pathway may involve multiple
mechanisms. Our study strongly suggests that FoxO-Rictor
axis is at least one important mechanism involved in this
feedback regulation.
Similar to other targeted therapies, it is likely that only a
fraction of patients with cancer will respond positively to
PI3K–AKT inhibition therapy. Thus, it will be critical to
identify appropriate biomarker(s) that can be used to
stratify patients with cancer for PI3K–AKT inhibition treatment. Our study suggests that FoxO may serve as a novel
biomarker to stratify patients with renal cancer for PI3K or
AKT inhibitor treatment. Speciﬁcally, because FoxO-deﬁcient renal tumors are more sensitive to PI3K–AKT inhibition than FoxO-proﬁcient renal tumors, we propose that
patients with renal cancer with loss of (or low) FoxO
expression or activity will respond better to PI3K–AKT
inhibition than those with high FoxO expression or activity.
In addition, we propose that inhibition of FoxO (or key FoxO
targets involved in feedback regulation, such as Rictor) may

synergize with PI3K–AKT inhibition in renal cancer treatment. Our study thus challenges the current paradigm of
reactivating FoxO in cancer treatment based on FoxO generally being considered as a tumor suppressor. Finally,
because the PI3K–AKT pathway is also activated in many
other cancers, our data may provide important insights into
the treatment of other cancers.
