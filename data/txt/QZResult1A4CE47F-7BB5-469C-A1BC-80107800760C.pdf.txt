ABSTRACT
Gain-of-function mutations of FLT3 (FLT3-ITD), comprises up to 30% of normal
karyotype acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and is associated with an adverse prognosis.
Current FLT3 kinase inhibitors have been tested extensively, but have not yet resulted
in a survival benefit and novel therapies are awaited. Here we show that T-LAK celloriginated protein kinase (TOPK), a mitotic kinase highly expressed in and correlated
with more aggressive phenotype in several types of cancer, is expressed in AML but not
in normal CD34+ cells and that TOPK knockdown decreased cell viability and induced
apoptosis. Treatment of AML cells with TOPK inhibitor (OTS514) resulted in a dosedependent decrease in cell viability with lower IC50 in FLT3-mutated cells, including
blasts obtained from patients relapsed after FLT3-inhibitor treatment. Using a MV411-engrafted mouse model, we found that mice treated with 7.5 mg/kg IV daily for 3
weeks survived significantly longer than vehicle treated mice (median survival 46 vs 29
days, P < 0.001). Importantly, we identified TOPK as a FLT3-ITD and CEBPA regulated
kinase, and that modulating TOPK expression or activity resulted in significant decrease
of FLT3 expression and CEBPA phosphorylation. Thus, targeting TOPK in FLT3-ITD AML
represents a novel therapeutic approach for this adverse risk subset of AML.

and activates the autocrine stimulatory loop contributing
to the pathogenesis and aggressiveness of the disease
[14, 15]. Therefore, compounds that inhibit both mutant
and overexpressed wild type FLT3 in AML may provide
a more effective therapeutic strategy than compounds
that only target the kinase activity of the mutant FLT3.
Indeed, emerging small molecule inhibitor compounds
have been shown to interfere with the aberrant FLT3
TK activity and lead to arrest of leukemia growth [4].
Unfortunately the clinical impact of these compounds
has not yet fulfilled the promise, possibly due to their
insufficient inhibition of FLT3, lack of specificity, and
the rapid emergence of resistance mechanisms in addition
to pharmacokinetic limitations [16–19]. A recent study
indicates that an ERK signaling pathway is likely to play
a role in the mechanism of resistance to FLT3 inhibition
conferred by stroma and FL ligand [20]. Indeed, some

INTRODUCTION
Gain-of-function mutations of the tyrosine kinase
(TK) receptor encoding FMS-like tyrosine kinase-3
(FLT3) have been observed in approximately 30%
of cytogenetically normal acute myeloid leukemia
(AML). Of the FLT3 mutations, the internal tandem
duplication (FLT3-ITD) is associated with poorer
outcome [1–6]. The FLT3-ITD and overexpression
of FLT3 constitutively activate several pathways like
MAPK/ERK, PI3K/AKT, NF-κB and STAT5 [7–10],
and repress important transcription factors involved in
myeloid differentiation, PU.1 and CEBPA [7, 11, 12].
Thus, FLT3-ITD mutation results in both increased cell
proliferation and block of myeloid differentiation [12,
13]. In addition, overexpression of the FLT3-wt receptor
and its ligand (FL) occurs in a high proportion of AML

alternative approaches for targeting FLT3-mutated AML
have been focused on targeting downstream pathways
(ERK1/2, CDK1, STAT5) that are activated by FLT3-ITD
[11, 12, 21, 22].
T-LAK cell–originated protein kinase (TOPK) is
a serine-threonine kinase that is highly expressed in and
correlated with a more aggressive phenotype in several
types of cancer such as breast cancer, Ewing sarcoma,
and colorectal cancer [23–31]. TOPK is hardly detectable
in normal tissues except the testis and fetal tissues [32].
TOPK was found to be involved in cancer cell mitosis and
proliferation [23, 26, 33].
TOPK belongs to the mitogen-activated protein
kinase kinase (MAPKK) family, a major part of the RAS/
RAF/MEK/ERK signaling axis. The latter is known to be
activated in AML and targeting the different components
of this pathway has been extensively investigated [34, 35].
Furthermore, a positive feedback loop between TOPK
and ERK2 has been identified to promote development
of colorectal cancer [25]. TOPK was also reported to
increase cell migration by modulating a PI3K/PTEN/AKTdependent signaling pathway [36]. Recently, TOPK was
found to be upregulated in prostate cancer and associated
with tumor invasiveness likely via activating MMPs
and β-catenin pathway [37]. In addition, CDK1/Cyclin
B1 activates TOPK during mitosis, which subsequently
promotes cytokinesis [33, 38, 39]. Although TOPK was
also reported to be up-regulated in a variety of hematologic
malignancies including AML [40], TOPK expression and
function in AML has not been fully elucidated.
Because of the possible interplay between TOPK
and other molecular targets known to be involved in
leukemia such as ERK1/2, CDK1, and CyclinB1, we
hypothesized that TOPK might play some role in AML and
therefore may serve as a therapeutic target in this disease.
Here we demonstrate that targeting TOPK expression or
kinase activity results in suppression of FLT3 expression
and inhibition of CEBPA phosphorylation leading to
enhanced myeloid differentiation and remarkable in vitro
and in vivo anti-leukemia activity, particularly in FLT3ITD AML. We also identified a mechanistic network by
which TOPK is deregulated in AML that involves both
FLT3 and CEBPA, genes often mutated in AML and
that play a central role in leukemogenesis. Therefore we
conclude that TOPK represents a novel therapeutic target
for FLT3-ITD AML.

(Supplementary Table S1), as well as in primary leukemia
blasts from 12 patients with AML. TOPK protein was
highly expressed in the majority of AML cell lines, and
in 7 of 12 AML primary blasts; however TOPK was not
detected in peripheral CD34+ mobilized cells from healthy
donors (Supplementary Figure S1A and S1B).

TOPK knock-down results in decreased cell
viability and increased apoptosis
To investigate TOPK as a potential therapeutic
target in AML, we utilized a loss of function approach in
two AML cell lines that express relatively high levels of
TOPK protein (MV4-11, U937), and in the KG1 cells that
express a very low level of TOPK, as a control. TOPK
knock-down (Figure 1A) resulted in significant decrease
(approximately 60%; P < 0.001) in cell viability in
MV4-11 and U937 cells, while no significant effect was
observed in KG1 cells (Figure 1B). In addition, annexin/
PI staining assessed by flow cytometry showed that TOPK
knock-down resulted in a dramatic increase in apoptosis
in MV4-11 cells; less effect on apoptosis was observed
in U937 cells (Figure 1C). We also validated this effect
in MOLM13 cells that express high level of TOPK
(Supplementary Figure S2).

TOPK inhibitor OTS514 exhibits cytotoxic
activity in AML cells but not in normal
CD34+ cells
Having shown that TOPK knock-down resulted in
enhancement of apoptosis and decrease in cell viability,
we then examined whether targeting TOPK kinase activity
with a recently developed TOPK inhibitor OTS514 [41]
would result in a cytotoxic effect in AML cells. We treated
primary blasts obtained from 3 patients with AML with
different concentrations of OTS514, and found a dose
dependent decrease in cell viability in all three samples,
with an IC50 that ranged from 10–20 nM (Figure 2A).
To further investigate the cytotoxic effect of OTS514 in
AML, CD34+ cells obtained from a patient with AML
(AML-CD34+) and those from a healthy donor (normalCD34+) were treated with OTS514, and assessed for
colony forming ability. We found a significant decrease
in the number of colonies per well in AML-CD34+ cells
treated with 10 nM of OTS514 compared to untreated cells
(41 vs 73, P = 0.01) (Figure 2B). In contrast, no effect was
observed following 20 nM or 40 nM of OTS514 treatment
of CD34+ cells obtained from healthy donors (39 vs 36,
P = 0.67; and 34 vs 36 P = 0.57) (Figure 2C).

selected 10 AML cell lines that represent the different
molecular and cytogenetic aberrations (Supplementary
Table S1), and treated these cell lines with different
concentrations of OTS514. Variable sensitivity to the
TOPK inhibitor among the different cell lines was
observed. Interestingly cell lines that carried FLT3
mutations (MV4-11, MOLM13 and KOCL-48) revealed
significantly higher sensitivity to OTS514 than other cell
lines (Mann-Whitney U test; P = 0.016) (Figures 3A and

We further confirmed the activity of this compound
by annexin/PI staining in MV4-11 and MOLM13 cell lines
(carrying FLT3-ITD mutation and expressing relatively
high level of TOPK), U937 (FLT3-negative cell line
expressing TOPK), and KG1 cells (FLT3-wt with very
low expression of TOPK). When cells were treated with
40nM of OTS514 for 48 hours, we observed an 80% and
70% increase in apoptotic cell population in MV4-11 and
MOLM13 cells, respectively, but only a 40% and 10%
increase in U937 and KG1 cells, respectively (Figure 3B).

Consistent with these findings, cleaved caspase 3 was
observed in MV4-11 cells but not in THP-1 (FLT3-wt
with high expression of TOPK) or KG1, when these cells
were treated under the same dose and duration (Figure
3C). To further validate that FLT3-ITD mutated AML
cells are more sensitive to OTS514, we evaluated cell
cycle kinetics in MV4-11 and THP-1 cells treated with
20 nM of OTS514 compared with untreated cells. MV4-11
cells showed a drastic decrease (~98%; P = 0.003) in the
S phase by 24- and 48-hour treatment; while we observed
74% and 27% decrease in the S phase in THP-1 cells
(P < 0.001 and P = 0.02), respectively (Figure 3D and
Supplementary Figure S4).
The anti-leukemia activity of TOPK inhibition was also
validated in primary blast cells obtained from three patients
with AML with FLT3-ITD mutation who had relapsed after
treatment with a potent FLT3 inhibitor (AC220 [quizartinib])
(Supplementary Table S2, Figure 4A). Apoptosis measured
by annexin/PI staining was significantly increased (50–80%)
in primary blasts treated with 40 nM of OTS514 (Figure 4B).
Primary blasts obtained from an additional patient were
treated with one dose of either 20 or 40 nM of OTS514, and
leukemia cells were completely eradicated by apoptosis five
days later as shown in Figure 4C.

likely due to toxicity rather than leukemia progression
(Supplementary Figure  S5). We did not observe any
decrease in body weight in mice treated with OTS514
(Figure 4F). Importantly, we found that mice treated with
7.5 mg/kg IV every day for 3 weeks survived significantly
longer than the control mice (median survival 46 days vs
29 days, P < 0.001; Figure 4G).

Targeting TOPK downregulates FLT3 expression
in AML cells
To provide insights into the molecular mechanism
by which TOPK inhibition results in stronger growth
suppression in FLT3-ITD mutated AML cells in comparison
to FLT3-wt AML cells, we performed gene expression
microarray analysis in FLT3-ITD mutated MV4-11 cells
transfected with TOPK-siRNA or treated with OTS514,
compared with control MV4-11 cells. Genes involved
in cell cycle control such as CCNB1, CHECK1 and
CDC25A were among those most strongly downregulated.
Interestingly, FLT3 was also one of the genes that were
down-regulated in MV4-11 cells treated with OTS514 as
well as those transfected with TOPK-siRNA, compared
with the respective MV4-11 control cells. We validated
these findings by qRT-PCR (P = 0.01; Figure 5A) and also
demonstrated that TOPK knockdown reduced FLT3 protein
level in MV4-11 cells (Figure 5B). OTS514 treatment also
resulted in downregulation of FLT3 transcription in FLT3ITD mutated cells (Figure 5C). In addition, we found that
total and phospho-FLT3 protein levels were significantly
depleted in MV4-11 cells treated with the TOPK inhibitor
(Figure 5D). Likewise, we found that protein and
phosphorylation levels of STAT5, a FLT3-ITD downstream
target, were significantly reduced in MV4-11 and MOLM13
cells that were treated with 20 nM of OTS514 (Figure 5E).
To further confirm that the reduction of FLT3 protein by the
TOPK inhibitor in FLT3-ITD cells was caused by inhibition
of FLT3 transcription rather than enhancement of protein
degradation, we assessed FLT3 protein stability following
OTS514 treatment and found no significant difference in the
FLT3 protein level between MV4-11 cells co-treated with
cyclohexamide (CHX; an inhibitor of protein translation)
and 20 nM of OTS514 and those treated with CHX alone
(Supplementary Figure S6). Furthermore, the activity of
TOPK and FLT3 kinase were measured after incubation
of each recombinant protein with increasing concentrations
of OTS514. OTS514 at a concentration of 1.2 μM resulted
in more than a 10 folds higher kinase inhibition of TOPK
than that of FLT3 (Supplementary Figure S7).

TOPK inhibitor exhibits in vivo anti-leukemia
activity in a MV4-11 engraft NSG mouse model
Having demonstrated the high preferential activity
of TOPK inhibitor OTS514 in AML cell lines and
primary blasts with FLT3-ITD mutation, we attempted
to examine the in vivo activity of this compound using a
previously established FLT3-ITD engraft murine model
[42]. For pharmacodynamics study, five mice were
transplanted with 1.0 × 105 of spleen cells obtained from
MV4-11 transplanted NSG mice. Starting on day 13 after
engraftment, mice were treated with OTS514 (N = 3, 7.5
mg/kg IV) or vehicle (N = 2, same volume IV) daily for
4 days. Mice were sacrificed 24 hours after the last dose,
and spleens were obtained and weighed. Spleens obtained
from mice treated with OTS514 showed significantly lower
weight than spleens obtained from vehicle treated mice
(P = 0.037; Figure 4D and 4E). For survival analysis, six
mice were used for each with of the treatment groups.
Spleen cells (1.0 × 105) from the fifth generation of MV4-11
transplanted NSG mice were injected into NSG mice via
the tail vein. Treatment with OTS514 (7.5 mg/kg IV) or
vehicle (same volume IV) was given daily for 3 weeks
starting 10 days after engraftment. Mice were weighed
daily and checked for signs of dehydration, discomfort or
toxicity. Although one mouse in the treatment group died
after the 19th injection, the bone marrow of that mouse
had a normal appearance with red color unlike the white
bone marrow (leukemia infiltration) of two other vehicle
treated mice that died on the same day. This suggests
that the death of the OTS514-treated mouse was more

previous studies suggesting that promotion of granulocytic
differentiation by CEBPA is inhibited in FLT3-ITD
AML via ERK1/2- or CDK1-mediated phosphorylation
of serine-21 [22, 44], we examined whether CEBPA
phosphorylation is modulated by TOPK activity. To test
this, we first examined CEBPA phosphorylation following
TOPK inhibitor treatment in MV4-11 and MOLM13
cells. Interestingly, p-CEBPA was decreased by 24-hour
treatment of 20 nM of OTS514 (Figure 5F). To further
confirm that CEBPA phosphorylation is modulated by
TOPK activity, we utilized a loss of function approach.
MV4-11 cells transfected with TOPK-siRNA showed a
decrease in p-CEBPA compared with cells transfected with
control-siRNA (Supplementary Figure S8A). Similarly,
cells transfected with FLT3 siRNA showed a decrease in
p-CEBPA levels (Supplementary Figure S8B). Therefore,
we speculated that OTS514 might enhance myeloid
differentiation in FLT3-ITD positive AML cells. Indeed,
primary blasts obtained from three patients with FLT3ITD AML treated with OTS514 showed a significant
increase in CD11b, (Figure 5G; P < 0.01) suggesting an
increase in myeloid differentiation.

resulted in significant decreases of TOPK mRNA and
protein levels, less effect was observed in U937 (P <
0.001; Figure 6I and 6J).

CEBPA P30 contributes to TOPK upregulation
in AML
We also examined whether CEBPA contributes to the
network that regulates both TOPK and FLT3 expression
and explains the reciprocal relationship between the two
genes. Interestingly, knock-down of CEBPA in MV4-11
cells did not affect either TOPK or FLT3 expression levels
(data are not shown). On the other hand, CEBPA knockdown in THP-1 resulted in a moderate decrease of TOPK
and FLT3 mRNA and protein levels (Figure 7A and 7B).
CEBPA is expressed as a full-length 42kD protein (P42)
and a truncated 30kD isoform protein (P30). The P42
functions as a myeloid differentiation factor that inhibits
cell proliferation, whereas the truncated CEBPA(P30)
does not have this function [50]. Although P30 could bind
E2F, it does not inhibit E2F/MYC transcriptional activity
like P42 does [50]. Moreover, mice carrying engineered
CEBPA alleles that specifically express the P30 isoform
developed AML with complete penetrance [51]. Hence,
in order to explain the conflicting results of the CEBPA
knock-down experiment, we assessed the contribution of
the two CEBPA isoforms on TOPK and FLT3 expression.
Here, we utilized a gain of function approach in
THP-1 cells. We found that overexpression of P30 resulted
in a significant increase in TOPK (~5.3 fold increase,
P = 0.004) and FLT3 mRNA (~2.3 fold increase,
P = 0.038) and protein levels; whereas, no significant
effect was observed when cells were transfected with P42
(Figure 7C and 7D).

TOPK is activated in FLT3-ITD AML cells
Having shown that TOPK inhibition exhibits
preferential anti-leukemia activity in AML with FLT3ITD, we speculated that TOPK expression or kinase
activity is upregulated in FLT3-ITD cells compared to
FLT3-wt cells. To investigate this hypothesis, we treated
MV4-11 cells with 50 nM of FLT3 inhibitor (MLN518)
for 18 hours and assessed p-TOPK by western blot. We
found a decrease of p-TOPK and t-TOPK in these cells
compared to untreated cells (Figure 6A). Furthermore,
THP-1 cells (cells that express a high level of FLT3-wt but
not FLT3-ITD) treated with FL ligand exhibited a slight
increase in the levels of p-TOPK and t-TOPK (Figure 6B).
Cells treated with MLN518 for 18 hours at 50 and 100 nM
(concentrations that are effective in FLT3-ITD mutated
cells; Figure 6C) resulted in a significant decrease of total
TOPK in FLT3-ITD mutated MOLM13 cells, but not in
FLT3-wt U937 cells (Figure 6D). Additionally, we found
that TOPK mRNA and protein levels were significantly
decreased following FLT3 knock-down with FLT3 siRNA
in MV4-11 cells (P = 0.003; Figure 6E and 6F).
A previous study demonstrated that MYC and
E2F1 drive TOPK expression in high-grade malignant
lymphoma [45]. MYC is a critical target for CEBPA in
granulopoiesis [46] and MYC related genes were found
to be upregulated in FLT3-ITD compared with FLT3-WT
AML samples [47–49]. Thus, we speculated that FLT3ITD upregulates TOPK expression through MYC activity.
Indeed MYC expression level decreased significantly in
MV4-11 cells transfected with FLT3-siRNA in comparison
with cells transfected with control-siRNA (Figure 6G and
6H). Furthermore, MYC knockdown in MV4-11 cells

DISCUSSION
Here we have demonstrated that TOPK is highly
expressed in the majority of AML cell lines, and readily
detected in myeloblasts from patients with AML in 50%
of the cases examined. In contrast, TOPK expression was
barely detectable in CD34+ cells derived from healthy
donors. These results are consistent with previous data
showing that TOPK is upregulated in hematological
malignancies [40]. The finding of TOPK overexpression
in AML cells suggests that it serves as an important target
for drug development in this disease. Indeed, a loss of
function approach showed that targeting TOPK in AML
cells resulted in a significant decrease of the cell viability
and strong induction of apoptosis.
We have recently reported the in vitro as well as
in vivo antitumor effect of the small molecule inhibitor
OTS514 which is a highly specific and potent inhibitor
for TOPK kinase activity [41]. Here, we investigated
the growth-suppressive effect of this compound in
AML cells and found that OTS514 has significant

cells derived from healthy donors. Importantly, OTS514
showed impressive in vivo anti-leukemia activity in
an aggressive MV4-11 engrafted mouse model, with
significant extension of survival in mice treated with this
drug compared with the control mice group. In this study
we also identified FLT3-ITD as a possible predictive
molecular marker for TOPK inhibitor therapy. The ability
to distinguish a subset of AML patients likely to have a
benefit from this therapeutic approach early in preclinical
development is important in the design of future clinical
trials.
While most of the patients with AML with FLT3ITD achieve a transient remission, they often suffer
early relapse with emergence of treatment resistance
[2–5]. Currently, allogeneic transplant remains the
only curative option for these patients. Several FLT3
inhibitors (sorafenib, midostaurin (PKC-412), quizartinib
(AC220), crinolanib, MLN518, CEP-701, SU11248)
have been tested in preclinical and clinical studies, and
revealed biological activity and acceptable toxicity
(15, 16, 31–36), but their impact on clinical outcome
remains uncertain [52]. Several mechanisms have been
attributed to the insufficient clinical benefit of FLT3
inhibitors including pharmacokinetic challenges and
treatment-induced point mutations in the FLT3 gene that
render AML cells resistant to the FLT3 kinase inhibitors
[53, 54]. Unlike FLT3 inhibitors currently in clinical trials
which target the FLT3 kinase activity, the TOPK inhibitor
targets the expression of FLT3 in FLT3-ITD AML cells
and, therefore, may overcome the obstacles observed
with the FLT3 kinase inhibitors, including the emergence
of resistant clones that carry mutations in the kinase
domain, or the negative feedback mechanisms resulting
in the upregulation of FL ligand and FLT3 expression.
Interestingly, we demonstrated that the TOPK inhibitor
provides potent anti-leukemia activity, even in primary
blasts with the FLT3-ITD mutation obtained from patients
with AML who progressed after treatment with a potent
FLT3 inhibitor (quizartinib, AC220).
Our functional analysis of TOPK identified this
kinase as a novel downstream target of FLT3-ITD. TOPK
plays an important role in a network involving CEBPA,
a crucial transcription factor that is often mutated in
AML and responsible for granulocytic differentiation.
In FLT3-ITD AML, CEBPA differentiation activity is
blocked due to its phosphorylation on Ser21 mediated
by CDK1 [22]. This functional mechanism may explain
the higher sensitivity of FLT3-ITD cells to TOPK
inhibition. We have demonstrated that TOPK is another
modulator of the CEBPA activity in FLT3-ITD mutated
AML cells. Previously, p38MAPK and ERK1/2 were
also reported to phosphorylate CEBPA on Ser21, inhibit
CEBPA activity and granulocyte differentiation in
CD34+ progenitors [12, 55, 56]. The TOPK inhibitor,
however, did not affect p38MAPK or ERK1/2 activities
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

or expression levels (data are not shown), suggesting
that the role of TOPK on CEBPA phosphorylation
is independent of the ERK and MAPK pathways.
Alternative approaches to target FLT3-ITD AML cells
have focused on modulating pathways that are either
downstream of, or interacting with, a FLT3-signaling
pathway. Inhibitors of components like ERK1/2, CDK1,
STAT5 and PIM1 have been extensively investigated in
FLT3-ITD AML [10, 22]. In comparison with two other
approaches to target FLT3-ITD AML using either a FLT3
inhibitor (MLN518) or a CDK1 inhibitor (flavopiridol),
OTS514 was significantly more effective in reducing cell
viability at a lower IC50 than MLN418 and flavopiridol
(Supplementary Figure S9).
In conclusion, our study demonstrates that TOPK
is highly expressed in AML cell lines and in primary
leukemia cells from patients with AML, and serves as a
novel therapeutic target. Targeting TOPK with OTS514
showed a remarkable growth-suppressive effect in
vitro as well as in vivo in FLT3-ITD AML cells. This
preferential activity of OTS514 in FLT3-ITD is likely
due to the strong reduction of FLT3 protein expression
and the resulting downregulation of its downstream
targets (i.e., STAT5) in addition to the decrease of
CEBPA phosphorylation resulting from TOPK inhibition.
Importantly, we identify a network mechanism by
which TOPK is deregulated in AML involving both
FLT3 and CEBPA, both of which play a central role in
leukemogenesis. Inhibition of TOPK decreases CEBPA
P42 phosphorylation which then becomes available
to bind E2F1 and inhibits E2F1/MYC transcriptional
activity resulting in the decrease of TOPK expression, and
possibly FLT3 (Figure 7E). Our proposed mechanistic
FLT3/TOPK/CEBPA network identifies TOPK as a
valid therapeutic target in AML. Thus, targeting TOPK
represents a novel therapeutic approach particularly for
patients with adverse risk FLT3-ITD AML.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell lines and primary blasts for in vitro
experiments
AML cell lines (ATCC, Manassas, VA) were
cultured in RPMI medium supplemented with 10–20%
fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Life Technologies, Grand
Island, NY). Myeloblasts from patients with AML were
maintained in RPMI medium supplemented with 20%
FBS, and 1x StemSpan CC100 (StemCell Technologies,
Vancouver, Canada). Leukemia cells were obtained by
apheresis of blood or bone marrow samples collected
from patients treated at the University of Chicago (UC)
and stored in the UC Leukemia Tissue Bank. Informed
consent to use the tissue for investigational studies was
obtained from each patient according to UC institutional
guidelines.

was quantified by flow cytometry on a FACSCalibur
instrument [58].

Transient transfection of cells was performed
utilizing 1 nmol (the final concentration in the medium
was unclear) of siRNA and 100 ul Gene Pulser buffer per
reaction, and the cells were electroporated using the BioRad Gene Pulse Xcell (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) or Amaxa
Nucleofector Kit (Lonza, Basel Switzerland) according to
manufacturer’s instructions.

In vivo studies
To investigate the anti-leukemia activity of OTS514
in vivo, we utilized a previously reported FLT3-ITD
engraft murine model and detailed in the supplemental
materials [42].

RNA extraction, RNA expression quantification

Statistical analysis

Total RNA was extracted using Trizol reagent (Life
Technologies). TOPK, FLT3, MYC mRNA expression
in AML cells was measured using the ViiA 7 system
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Each
cDNA was synthesized using SuperScript III reagents
(Life Technologies,) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. Quantitative Real-Time PCR (qRT-PCR)
was performed using commercially available TaqMan
Gene Expression Assay primers and probes with the ViiA
7 system (Life Technologies). The expression levels were
normalized to B2M gene.

Mechanistic and biological experiments were analyzed
with paired and unpaired two-sided t-tests. P values < .05
were considered statistically significant. Experiments were
performed in triplicate (except for when patient blasts
were used, these experiment were done in duplicate when
possible), results were presented by Mean ± SEM. Percent
survival were calculated using Kaplan-Meier method and the
Log-rank test was used to compare the survival curves.
