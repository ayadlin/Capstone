Abstract
The mitotic kinase Aurora A is an important therapeutic target for cancer therapy. This study evaluated
new mechanism-based pharmacodynamic biomarkers in cancer patients in two phase I studies of MLN8054,
a small-molecule inhibitor of Aurora A kinase. Patients with advanced solid tumors received MLN8054 orally
for 7 consecutive days in escalating dose cohorts, with skin and tumor biopsies obtained before and after
dosing. Skin biopsies were evaluated for increased mitotic cells within the basal epithelium. Tumor biopsies
were assessed for accumulation of mitotic cells within proliferative tumor regions. Several patients in the
highest dose cohorts showed marked increases in the skin mitotic index after dosing. Although some tumors
exhibited increases in mitotic cells after dosing, others displayed decreases, a variable outcome consistent
with dual mechanisms of mitotic arrest and mitotic slippage induced by antimitotics in tumors. To provide a
clearer picture, mitotic cell chromosome alignment and spindle bipolarity, new biomarkers of Aurora A
inhibition that act independently of mitotic arrest or slippage, were assessed in the tumor biopsies. Several
patients, primarily in the highest dose cohorts, had marked decreases in the percentage of mitotic cells with
aligned chromosomes and bipolar spindles after dosing. Evidence existed for an exposure–effect relationship
for mitotic cells with defects in chromosome alignment and spindle bipolarity that indicated a biologically
active dose range. Outcomes of pharmacodynamic assays from skin and tumor biopsies were concordant in
several patients. Together, these new pharmacodynamic assays provide evidence for Aurora A inhibition by
MLN8054 in patient skin and tumor tissues. Cancer Res; 71(3); 675–85. 2010 AACR.

Introduction
The mitotic spindle is a validated anticancer target, against
which many small-molecule inhibitors have been tested. The
majority of these inhibitors have targeted b-tubulin, a structural component of the mitotic spindle. As tubulin also plays a
necessary role in nonmitotic processes, such as retrograde

neuronal transport, tubulin-targeted cytotoxics carry the burden of on-target toxicities such as peripheral neuropathy (1).
Newer antimitotic agents targeting enzymes specifically
involved in mitosis represent an alternative approach to
antimitotic therapy that promises a narrower spectrum of
on-target toxicities and the potential for antitumor activity
where traditional antimitotics are ineffective. One such class
of antimitotic agents targets the Aurora kinases: Aurora A,
Aurora B, or both (reviewed in refs. 2–6). Aurora A and Aurora
B are serine/threonine kinases that play essential roles in
mitosis.
Aurora A functions in centrosome separation, bipolar spindle assembly, spindle pole integrity, and chromosome segregation during mitosis (reviewed in refs. 7–12). Consistent with
the diverse roles of Aurora A kinase, perturbation of Aurora
A function in tissue culture or in mice leads to a complex
assortment of mitotic defects, including monopolar and
multipolar mitotic spindles, failure of chromosome alignment
at the metaphase plate, and chromosome missegregation
during anaphase and telophase (13–17). The spindle defects
that arise in cells lacking functional Aurora A lead to mitotic

arrest in metaphase, presumably mediated by the spindle
assembly checkpoint.
Evidence exists to support 2 alternative outcomes subsequent to arrest in metaphase. In some settings, mitotic arrest
is prolonged and leads to death directly out of prometaphase.
In others, the mitotic arrest is transient and is followed by
inappropriate passage through mitosis, which is accompanied
by chromosome segregation defects and then cell-cycle arrest
or death (18, 19). Such a diversity of terminal outcomes
following mitotic arrest occurs with multiple antimitotic
agents such as taxanes and KSP inhibitors (18, 19). In fact,
the diversity of terminal outcomes subsequent to the engagement of the spindle assembly checkpoint represents a challenge for incorporating pharmacodynamic readouts in
antimitotic drug development. For example, early attempts
to place taxane pharmacodynamics on a rational footing by
using the mitotic index as a predictive marker were abandoned after preclinical in vivo work showed weak (20) or
nonexistent correlations (21) between the degree of mitotic
arrest and tumor response. Similar observations were made in
patient tumor biopsies (22). If mitotic arrest were the sole
outcome induced by taxanes, a correlation between degree of
mitotic arrest and tumor response would be expected; the lack
of correlation is consistent with the dual mechanisms of
mitotic arrest and mitotic slippage induced by antimitotics.
Clearly, a more complete picture of the mechanism of action
of newer targeted antimitotic agents would help inform the
development and interpretation of pharmacodynamic markers of these agents.
This article describes in detail the phase I pharmacodynamic activity of MLN8054, a selective small-molecule inhibitor of Aurora A kinase (23). The pharmacodynamic strategy
for MLN8054 was challenged by the dual mechanisms of
mitotic arrest and mitotic slippage that occur upon Aurora
A inhibition. Therefore, a broad panel of pharmacodynamic
markers was developed on the basis of the diverse molecular
sequelae that occur subsequent to Aurora A inhibition with
MLN8054 (14). In addition to measuring mitotic and apoptotic
cell accumulation in patient skin and tumor biopsies, the
pharmacodynamic marker panel included mitotic cell chromosome alignment and spindle bipolarity. The incorporation
of these latter markers was critical, as the degree of chromosome alignment and spindle bipolarity decreases with Aurora
A inhibition regardless of whether a cell undergoes prolonged
mitotic arrest or a transient mitotic delay followed by mitotic
slippage. The goals of this phase I pharmacodynamic study
were 2-fold, (i) to gain an understanding of the behavior of a
new pharmacodynamic marker panel in a first-in-human
clinical setting and (ii) to evaluate modulation of the Aurora
A pathway in patient skin and tumor tissues with MLN8054
administration.

Materials and Methods
Clinical trial design
Two concurrent phase I trials were performed in patients
with advanced solid tumors to evaluate the dose-limiting
toxicities and maximum tolerated dose of MLN8054 adminis-

tered orally for 7 to 21 consecutive days; clinical findings are
described in detail elsewhere (24, 25). As a secondary objective,
these trials aimed to evaluate the pharmacodynamic effects of
MLN8054 on Aurora A inhibition in skin and tumor biopsies.
The C10001 study was performed at 3 clinical sites in the
United States, and the C10002 study was performed at 2 sites
in Spain. Dose escalation followed a standard phase I 3 þ 3
design. The information in this report was derived from
patients dosed with MLN8054 4 times daily (qid), with the
largest dose in the evening hours.
Blood samples
Blood samples for pharmacokinetic (PK) analyses were
drawn once at baseline and serially for the second dose on
day 7. Plasma was extracted from blood immediately and
stored at 70 C until analysis. Analysis of plasma samples
used a validated LC/MS/MS assay. The lower and upper limits
of quantification for the undiluted MLN8054 samples were 5
ng/mL and 2,500 ng/mL, respectively. Calculation of PK
parameters was performed using WinNonlin Professional
Version 5.2.
Skin and tumor biopsies
Skin and tumor biopsies were obtained from patients as
previously described (26, 27). Institutional Review Board
approval was obtained at all participating centers, and
informed consent for pharmacodynamic analysis was received
from patients who underwent biopsies. All samples were fixed
in 10% neutral-buffered formalin overnight and stored in 70%
ethyl alcohol before embedding in paraffin.
Histopathology assessment
Five-micrometer skin sections of formalin-fixed, paraffinembedded skin punch biopsies were deparaffinized and
stained by standard methods with hematoxylin and eosin
(H&E) using a Leica Autostainer XL (Meyer Instruments,
Inc.). Stained sections were evaluated for the presence of
mitotic and apoptotic cells within the basal epithelial layer
(BEL).
Skin mitotic index
Immunohistochemistry was performed on 5-mm sections of
formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded skin punch biopsies. Sections were stained using the Discovery XT automated slide
staining instrument (Ventana Medical Systems). After sections were deparaffinized with EZ Prep solution (Ventana
Medical Systems), antigen retrieval was completed with Cell
Conditioning 1 solution (CC1; Ventana Medical Systems).
Sections were stained with mouse anti-phospho-Ser/ThrPro, MPM-2 antibody (1:100; Upstate Biotechnology) and
rabbit anti-Phospho-histone H3 polyclonal antibody (1:25;
Upstate Biotechnology) for 60 minutes. The ARK Peroxidase
(DAKO Animal Research Kit, Dako) method was used to
prepare a working dilution of the MPM-2 antibody. Secondary
antibodies included Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated Streptavidin
(1:100; Molecular Probes) and Rhodamine-Red-X-AffiniPure
goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:25; Jackson Immunoresearch). To
reduce tissue autofluorescence, the slides were stained with

0.5% Sudan Black B (Sigma Aldrich) and mounted with DAPI
Vectashield Hard Set Mounting Medium (Vector Laboratories).
The number of mitotic cells within the BEL was counted
manually in a blinded fashion. The length of the BEL was
determined by acquiring skin biopsy images at low magnification (2 objective) using an automated microscope (Nikon
Instruments) with filter wheel (Sutter Instruments), XYZ stage
(Prior Scientific), CCD camera (Hamamatsu), and automated
slide loader (Prior Scientific) controlled by MetaMorph software (Molecular Devices). Measurement of the BEL was
performed using a touch pen and MetaMorph software to
manually draw a region on the image; calibrated lengths of
each sample were determined. The skin mitotic index was
calculated by determining the number of mitotic cells per
millimeter of BEL.
Tumor mitotic index
Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tumor biopsies were
sectioned at 5 mm. Sections were deparaffinized with xylene
and hydrated with ethanol washes; antigen retrieval was
performed with 0.01 mol/L of citrate buffer solution (pH
6.0) with a pressure cooker–heating source. Sections were
stained with mouse anti-Ki67, K-2 mouse monoclonal antibody (1:1; Ventana) and rabbit anti-phospho-histone H3 polyclonal antibody (1:25) for 60 minutes at room temperature.
Secondary antibodies included Alexa-488 Goat anti-mouse
(A11001, 1:100; Molecular Probes) and Rhodamine-Red-XAffiniPure goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:25; Jackson Immunoresearch). Slides were mounted with DAPI Vectashield Hard
Set Mounting Medium (H-1500; Vector Laboratories). Images
were captured using the previously described microscope
system (10 objective) and the mitotic index was determined
from the percentage of phospho-histone H3 (pHistH3) immunopositive cells within the Ki67-positive area using Metamorph Software.
Mitotic cell spindle bipolarity and chromosome
alignment
Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tumor biopsies were
sectioned at 5 mm and stained using the Discovery XT automated slide-staining instrument. Sections were deparaffinized
on the instrument with EZ Prep solution and antigen retrieval
was completed with CC1. Immunofluorescence staining was
performed using mouse anti-a-tubulin clone DM1A FITC
(fluorescein isothiocyanate)-conjugated antibody (1:100; Cell
Signaling) for 60 minutes. The previously described microscope system (40 objective) was used to acquire image
stacks (26 focal planes spaced 0.2 mm apart). The resulting
image stacks were deconvolved to remove out-of-focus information, the mitotic cells were identified, and 3-dimensional
(3D) reconstructions of the cells were generated using MetaMorph image analysis software. Five or six scorers reviewed
3D rotations of each mitotic cell in a blinded, randomized
order to characterize chromosome alignment (aligned vs. not
aligned) and spindle bipolarity (bipolar vs. not bipolar)
according to preestablished criteria. The majority call for
each spindle was used for further analyses; spindles for which

www.aacrjournals.org

no majority call existed were not included. The concordance
of all scorers (defined as the percentage of identical calls made
by all possible pairs of scorers) was greater than 85% for both
the chromosome alignment and spindle bipolarity and assessments. Misaligned chromosomes and the absence of properly
formed bipolar mitotic spindles are both hallmark phenotypes
of Aurora A inhibition (14, 16).
Exposure–response assessment of tumor
pharmacodynamics
Plasma concentrations of MLN8054 were measured from
patient blood samples to calculate steady-state areas under
the plasma concentration–time curve over the dosing interval
(AUC0–t) using noncompartmental methods, as described
previously (24, 25). For purposes of exposure–response assessments, steady-state average concentration [Css,avg, calculated
as the area under the concentration–time curve (AUC0–t)
divided by the length of the dosing interval] was used as
the independent variable in each patient with tumor pharmacodynamic data. The dependent variables were percentage
of pretreatment percentage of mitotic cells with aligned
chromosomes and percentage of pretreatment percentage
of mitotic cells with bipolar spindles. The distribution of
Css,avg of MLN8054 over the clinically tested dose range
(10–80 mg/d) was forecasted using SigmaPlot Version 11,
on the basis of the observed dose-normalized Css,avg data in
patients with steady-state PK measurements. To infer a
biologically active dose range for MLN8054, the exposure–
response relationship was viewed in the context of the dose–
exposure relationship.

Results
All patients enrolled in both the C10001 and C10002 trials
underwent approximately 3-mm skin punch biopsies for
pharmacodynamic analysis. Patients underwent 3 skin biopsies: on day 1 prior to the first daily dose; on day 7, 2 to 4 hours
before the second daily dose; and on day 7, 2 to 4 hours after
the second daily dose (Supplementary Fig. 1). The purpose of
these biopsies was to detect inhibition of Aurora A by
MLN8054 in proliferating basal epithelial cells. Assessment
of Aurora A inhibition in the skin biopsies relied on detecting
an accumulation of mitotic cells within the BEL by immunofluorescent staining of 5-mm skin sections for the mitotic
markers pSer10 Histone H3 (pHistH3) and MPM2, as well as
for DNA. A mitotic index in skin was determined by counting
the number of mitotic cells per millimeter length of the BEL. In
addition, the H&E-stained skin biopsy sections were evaluated
histopathologically.
In the C10002 trial, approximately 2 of every 3 patients in
each dose cohort underwent tumor biopsies. Biopsies were
obtained on day 1 prior to the first daily dose and on day 7, 2 to
4 hours after the second daily dose (Supplementary Fig. 1).
Aurora A inhibition in the tumor biopsies was assessed by
evaluating an accumulation of mitotic cells within proliferative tumor regions by immunofluorescent staining of tumor
sections for pHistH3, KI67, and DNA. The mitotic index was
evaluated in tumor biopsies by calculating the percentage of

total cells (nuclei count) that were mitotic (pHistH3 immunopositive) within the proliferative tumor regions (KI67
immunopositive) using automated image processing. In addition, mitotic cells within the tumor sections were assessed for
misaligned chromosomes and the absence of properly formed
bipolar mitotic spindles, which are both hallmark phenotypes
of Aurora A inhibition (14, 16). Preclinical studies in HCT-116
colon tumor-bearing immunocompromised mice demonstrated an exposure-related decrease in tumor mitotic cell
chromosome alignment and spindle bipolarity (Supplementary Fig. 2).
In order to assess tumor mitotic cells for chromosome
alignment and spindle bipolarity, sections underwent immunofluorescent staining for a-tubulin and DNA (Fig. 1A). Examples of mitotic cells from patient tumor biopsies with aligned
chromosomes/bipolar spindles, unaligned chromosomes/
bipolar spindles, and unaligned chromosomes/nonbipolar
spindles are shown (Fig. 1B).

70 mg/d of MLN8054 with qid dosing. The percentage of cells
with aligned chromosomes was examined in the predose and
day 7 biopsies (Fig. 2A). Sixty-eight percent of the mitotic cells
had aligned chromosomes in the predose biopsy, whereas 25%
of the mitotic cells had aligned chromosomes in the day 7
biopsy. A similar decrease was observed when evaluating the
percentage of bipolar spindles: 67% of the mitotic cells in the
predose biopsy had bipolar spindles, and this decreased to
23% in the day 7 biopsy (Fig. 2B). These tumor biopsies were
also evaluated for mitotic index, which increased from 6.8% in
the predose biopsy to 9.7% in the postdose biopsy (Fig. 2C).
This decrease in aligned chromosomes and bipolar spindles in
mitotic cells and increase in mitotic index in the tumor
biopsies after treatment with MLN8054 are outcomes consistent with inhibition of Aurora A. Skin biopsies from this
patient also demonstrated an increase in the number of
mitotic cells within the BEL (Fig. 2D and E). The mitotic
index increased from 0.13 in the predose biopsy to 3.72 and
3.04, respectively, in the 2 biopsies on day 7. In addition, when
evaluating H&E-stained sections, many mitotic figures could
readily be discerned in the day 7 biopsies, whereas these were
rarely observed in the predose biopsy (Fig. 2F). Moreover,

Figure 3. Skin mitotic index in patients with evaluable predose and day 7 biopsies. Mitotic cells (pHistH3 immunopositive) were counted in 2–4
5-mmol/L sections of each skin biopsy taken from patients enrolled in the C10001 (A) and C10002 (B) MLN8054 trials. The average number of
mitotic cells in the predose biopsy was subtracted from that of the day 7 biopsies (biopsy 1 and biopsy 2). Positive values represent an increase
in the mitotic cells in the day 7 biopsies relative to the predose biopsy, a phenotype consistent with Aurora A inhibition. The dose cohort in which each
patient belonged is shown.

several of these cells were histopathologically characterized as
being either preapoptotic or frankly apoptotic according to
morphologic features. The increase in the mitotic index along
with the appearance of apoptotic cells in the skin biopsies
after treatment with MLN8054 were outcomes consistent with
inhibition of Aurora A.
The skin mitotic index was assessed in all patients who had
evaluable predose and day 7 biopsies from the C10001 and
C10002 studies (n ¼ 67; Fig. 3A and B, respectively; Supplementary Table 1). For this evaluation, the mitotic index of the
predose biopsy was subtracted from the average mitotic index
of the day 7 postdose biopsies 1 and 2. Positive values reflect
an increased mitotic index in the postdose biopsies relative to
the predose biopsies (baseline). On average, the predose skin
biopsies contained 0.20 mitotic cells per millimeter of BEL.
When examining patients across both studies at all doses
within the qid dose cohort, there was a significant difference
in the predose biopsy mitotic index compared with the mean
of the day 7 postdose biopsies 1 and 2, which rose to 0.50
mitotic cells per millimeter of BEL (P < 0.0001; Supplementary
Table 2). Moreover, 48 of the 67 patients with evaluable

680

Cancer Res; 71(3) February 1, 2011

predose and postdose skin biopsies showed an increased
mitotic index. Nevertheless, the magnitude of this increase
varied greatly, and in certain cases, the increase may simply
have been due to baseline variation. Notably, in several
patients in the 2 highest dose cohorts of the C10002 study
(70 and 80 mg), there were robust increases in the mitotic
index in the day 7 biopsies relative to baseline. It is unclear
why similar effects were not observed in the C10001 study in
patients dosed in the 70 and 80 mg cohorts.
The tumor mitotic index was also evaluated for all patients
that had evaluable pre- and postdose tumor samples for this
assay (n ¼ 15; Fig. 4A). In the predose biopsies, the mitotic
index ranged between 0% and 9.4% (Supplementary Table 3).
Several patients demonstrated increased levels of mitotic cells
after MLN8054 dosing; however, the magnitude of these
increases varied considerably. In some patients, the mitotic
index also decreased after dosing. Moreover, when examining
the tumor mitotic index across all patients, there was no
difference in the predose biopsy mitotic index when compared
with the day 7 postdose biopsies (P ¼ 0.5614; Wilcoxon signed
rank test).

Figure 4. Tumor mitotic index and mitotic cell chromosome alignment and spindle bipolarity in patients with evaluable predose and day 7 tumor biopsies. A,
the mitotic index was determined from the percentage of pHistH3 immunopositive cells that were also Ki67 positive. The percent pHistH3-positive cells in the
predose biopsy were subtracted from that of the day 7 biopsy. Positive values represent an increase in the mitotic index in the day 7 biopsy relative to
the predose biopsy; a phenotype consistent with Aurora A inhibition. The percentage of mitotic cells with aligned chromosomes (B) and the percentage of
mitotic cells with bipolar spindles (C) in the day 7 biopsies were subtracted from those of the predose biopsy. Positive values represent a decrease in
the percent of mitotic cells with aligned chromosomes or bipolar spindles in the day 7 biopsy relative to the predose biopsy, a phenotype consistent with
Aurora A inhibition. The dose cohort in which each patient belonged is shown.

Mitotic cell chromosome alignment and spindle bipolarity
were examined in all patients that had evaluable pre- and
postdose samples of sufficient quality for this immunofluorescent based analysis (n ¼ 9/15 available paired pre- and
postdose biopsies). Unlike the changes in the tumor mitotic
index assay, unaligned chromosomes and the nonbipolar
spindles occur immediately after Aurora A inhibition in
mitotic cells and are therefore refractory to the complexities
that affect interpretation of the tumor mitotic index. In the
predose tumor biopsies, the percentage of mitotic cells with
aligned chromosomes varied considerably, and ranged
between 16% and 68% (Fig. 4B; Supplementary Table 4).
The percentage of mitotic cells with bipolar spindles ranged
between 25% and 67% (Fig. 4C; Supplementary Table 5).
Regardless of the baseline levels for mitotic cell–aligned
chromosomes and bipolar spindles, several patients (5/9
examined), notably those in the highest dose cohorts (60,
70, and 80 mg), had marked decreases in the percentage of
mitotic cells with aligned chromosomes and bipolar spindles
after 7 days of MLN8054 dosing.
For patients with evaluable pre- and postdose skin and
tumor biopsies for the multiple pharmacodynamic readouts
used in this study (n ¼ 9), chromosome alignment and spindle
bipolarity showed a strong concordance with each other
(Pearson r ¼ 0.95, P < 0.0001; Table 1). Tumor mitotic index
also correlated with the percent of mitotic cells with aligned
chromosomes (Pearson r ¼ 0.69, P ¼ 0.039), and spindle
bipolarity (Pearson r ¼ 0.80, P ¼ 0.0100). The correlation
between tumor and skin mitotic index is not significant
(Pearson r ¼ 0.46, P ¼ 0.21). It is interesting to note, however,
that patients in the lowest dose cohorts had no pronounced
effect in either the skin or tumor assays and the 2 patients with

large increases in mitotic index in skin also showed large
increases in tumor mitotic index.
Exploratory analysis of exposure–response relationships of
tumor pharmacodynamic effects was consistent with a steadystate, exposure-related decrease in the percentages of tumor
mitotic cells with aligned chromosomes (Fig. 5A) and bipolar
spindles (Fig. 5B). On the basis of the visual assessment of
underlying exposure–response relationships, a steep relationship between systemic exposure to MLN8054 and tumor
pharmacodynamic effects was observed. Near-maximal pharmacodynamic effects were observed at Css,avg of approximately 1,500 nmol/L or higher. Pharmacokinetic analysis in
all patients treated in the C10001 and C10002 trials (n ¼ 85)
permitted projection of the distribution of Css,avg over the
clinically tested dose range of 10 to 80 mg/d (Fig. 5C). When
the dose–exposure relationship was viewed in the context of
the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic assessments
(Fig. 5A and B), it appeared that doses of 50 mg/d or higher
provided steady-state exposures associated with pharmacodynamic effects in tumor tissue in greater than 50% of
patients. Approximately, 75% of patients treated in the 70to 80-mg/d cohorts would be expected to demonstrate tumor
pharmacodynamic effects following MLN8054 treatment.
However, the dose-limiting toxicities of somnolence and
transaminitis encountered in these trials (24, 25) precluded
achieving these pharmacodynamically active doses for multiple cycles of treatment.

Discussion
This is the first description of the biological effects of Aurora
A kinase inhibition in human tumor and skin specimens

obtained from patients with advanced solid tumors. A broad
panel of mechanistic biomarkers was used to demonstrate
Aurora A kinase modulation in patients treated with
MLN8054. The pharmacodynamic marker panel comprised
the mitotic index, a histopathologic assessment in skin biop-

sies; and the mitotic index, chromosome alignment, and spindle bipolarity analyses in tumor biopsies. In several patients
who had evaluable pre- and postdose skin and tumor biopsies,
there was a concordant response between all of these assays,
which was consistent with Aurora A kinase inhibition.
This report also marks the first use of the chromosome
alignment and spindle bipolarity biomarkers as a clinical
pharmacodynamic readout for antimitotics. In part due to
the challenging nature of the mitotic index, and in part due to
the historic use of the term cytotoxic to describe antimitotics,
myelosuppression has consistently been the pharmacodynamic readout described in clinical trials with this class of
drugs. A number of antimitotic agents have been developed in
the past decade with no pharmacodynamic readout other
than myelosuppression. Although myelosuppression has been
demonstrated to be associated with clinical efficacy (28, 29),
studies of alternate dosing schedules (e.g., with weekly taxanes
in breast cancer) have demonstrated the therapeutic value of
schedules that reduce myelosuppression without reducing
clinical response rates (reviewed in ref. 30). This suggests
that in at least some settings the PK/toxicity relationship for
myelosuppression may not always track with the PK/response
relationship. Thus, the development of the chromosome alignment and spindle bipolarity assays in patient tumor samples
provides a significant addition to the toolbox for evaluating
antimitotic drugs.
Caution was required in the interpretation of the results
from the assays used in this study, as the chromosome
alignment and spindle bipolarity assays were simultaneously
developed and deployed in this first-in-human trial for a firstin-class molecule. Two factors in particular provided a measure of confidence around the interpretation of the data. First,
the semi-quantitative nature of these assays (morphologic
assays with a binary readout) enabled us to minimize issues
of signal-to-noise and immunofluorescence staining variability. The scoring of the individual spindles was performed in a
randomized and blinded manner and was based on concordance between individual scorers. Second, the weight of
evidence approach enabled a composite picture of the behavior of multiple markers simultaneously. For the majority of
patients with tumor biopsies, there were no disagreements in
the direction of change among all 4 markers (Table 1).
Tumor cells undergoing a mitotic delay as a result of Aurora
A kinase inhibition would be expected to show defects in
chromosome alignment and spindle bipolarity (14, 16). However, defects in spindle bipolarity and chromosome alignment
may not necessarily be accompanied by a mitotic delay. As
was seen in the tumor mitotic index in patients treated with
MLN8054, considerable variability in mitotic index may occur
depending on the response of individual tumors to antimitotic
agents as well as the duration of target inhibition. Given these
complexities, the results of the tumor mitotic index in clinical
studies with patients with different tumor types were difficult
to interpret. However, a significant increase in the mitotic
index of some sequential tumor biopsies obtained from
patients treated with MLN8054 was observed, and this likely
occurred through Aurora A inhibition. The marker used for
determining the mitotic index in both skin and tumor biopsies

was histone H3 phosphorylated on serine 10 (pHistH3). In
cells, this phosphorylation is catalyzed by Aurora B. If
MLN8054 were inhibiting Aurora B, a decrease in pHistH3positive cells would occur, rather than an increase. Therefore,
at the exposures achieved in these phase 1 studies, MLN8054
has proven to be selective for Aurora A relative to Aurora B.
Unlike the changes in the tumor mitotic index assay,
unaligned chromosomes and nonbipolar spindles occur
immediately after Aurora A inhibition in mitotic cells and
are not influenced by the complexities that affect interpretation of the tumor mitotic index. Therefore, the incorporation
of the mitotic cell chromosome alignment and spindle bipolarity assays in this study improved our ability to gauge Aurora
A kinase inhibition in the tumor biopsies, as these readouts
are only assessed in mitotic cells and are therefore independent of the size of the mitotic fraction. Importantly, the
quantitative endpoints in these assays permitted exploration
of potential exposure–response relationships for the tumor
pharmacodynamic effects, thus enabling conclusions regarding the biologically active dose range. On the basis of these
analyses, pharmacodynamic activity of MLN8054 is expected
to occur at doses at or above 70 or 80 mg/d.
Preclinical work performed in vitro suggests that changes in
the mitotic index, spindle bipolarity, and chromosome alignment are necessary for the death or terminal arrest of cells
lacking functional Aurora A (14, 23). However, detection of
these outcomes demonstrating Aurora A inhibition may not
be sufficient for death or terminal arrest of cells. As such, the
magnitude and duration of the pharmacodynamic modulation
presented in this study cannot be interpreted as predicting
clinical efficacy for this molecule because of the necessary but
not sufficient nature of these pharmacodynamic biomarkers.

In fact, there was limited evidence for antitumor clinical
activity in the C10001 and C10002 trials (24, 25).
Nevertheless, the pharmacodynamic markers implemented
in this study have been used to answer the specific question,
‘Is Aurora A activity modulated in skin and tumor tissue from
patients treated with MLN8054?’ In that respect, the biomarker panel used in this trial provided clear evidence that Aurora
A was inhibited in patients treated with MLN8054. These
markers are now being implemented for the clinical evaluation of a second generation Aurora A kinase inhibitor
MLN8237, which is being tested in multiple phase 1 and 2
clinical trials in cancer patients.
