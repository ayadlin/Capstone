BACKGROUND: EZN-2208 is a water-soluble, polyethylene glycol drug conjugate of SN38, which is the active moiety of irinotecan. In
this study, the authors evaluated the tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), and activity of EZN-2208 in adult patients with advanced
solid tumors. METHODS: Patients in sequential cohorts (3 þ 3 design) received intravenous EZN-2208 at doses between 1.25 mg/m2
and 25 mg/m2 once every 21 days. RESULTS: Thirty-nine patients received EZN-2208. The median number of prior therapies was 2
(range, 0-10 prior therapies). Seventeen patients received prior irinotecan. Two maximum tolerated doses (MTDs) were defined: EZN2208 with (16.5 mg/m2) and without (10 mg/m2) granulocyte-colony–stimulating factor (G-CSF). The dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) was
febrile neutropenia. Two of 19 patients who were heterozygous for a polymorphism in the uridine diphosphate glucuronosyltransferase 1 family, polypeptide A1 (UGT1A1) gene (UGT1A1*28) developed DLTs (dose, 25 mg/m2 with G-CSF), and 2 patients who were
homozygous for UGT1A1*28 were treated without DLTs (dose, 5 mg/m2). PK analysis indicated a mean terminal half-life of 19.4  3.4
hours. Sixteen patients (41%) achieved stable disease, including 6 of 39 patients (15%) who had stable disease that lasted 4 months.
One patient with cholangiocarcinoma (no prior irinotecan) achieved a short-lived 32% tumor regression. Among 6 patients who had
stable disease that lasted for 4 months, 3 had received prior irinotecan, and 1 had KRAS-positive colorectal cancer. CONCLUSIONS:
EZN-2208 was well tolerated and produced stable disease that lasted for 4 months/unconfirmed partial responses in 7 of 39 heavily
pretreated patients (18%) with advanced solid tumors, including those who had failed prior irinotecan therapy. Cancer 2012;118:6144C 2012 American Cancer Society.

INTRODUCTION
Topoisomerase I inhibitors are a class of anticancer drugs whose mechanism of action depends on their ability to block
both deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) replication and transcription, resulting in apoptosis. Wall and Wani isolated the lead
compound in this class of drugs, camptothecin, from the Chinese bush Camptotheca acuminata.1 Two camptothecins
have been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for clinical use: topotecan (Hycamtin; GlaxoSmithKline
PLC, London, United Kingdom) and irinotecan (Camptosar, Pfizer, Inc., New York).
Irinotecan is approved for use in the treatment of advanced colorectal cancer, both as first-line therapy in combination with 5-fluorouracil and as salvage treatment in 5-fluorouracil-refractory disease. Despite its established anticancer activity, irinotecan has major limitations. First, irinotecan is a prodrug, which is cleaved at its bis-piperidine rings (which
impart water solubility), producing SN38, the active moiety of irinotecan.2 SN38 has 100-fold to 1000-fold more potent
in vitro cytotoxic activity compared with irinotecan.2 Only 3% to 4% of an injected dose of irinotecan is converted to
SN38 in the liver,2,3 and 55% is excreted as intact irinotecan in humans.3 Hence, little SN38 is created in the body.
A second limitation of irinotecan is that it is inactivated within minutes at physiological pH by the opening of its lactone E-ring. In particular, it is known that 24 hours after irinotecan infusion in humans, approximately 25% to 30% and
50% to 64% of irinotecan and SN38, respectively, are in the inactive form.4 Hence, if conversion to the inactive form of
the molecule was inhibited in the prodrug, the therapeutic benefit might be improved.

Phase 1 Study of EZN-2208/Kurzrock et al

A third limitation of irinotecan is the numerous
metabolites produced, such as 7-ethyl-10-(4-N-[5-aminopentanoic acid]-1-piperidino) carbonyloxycamptothecin
(APC) and 7-ethyl-10-(4-[1-piperidino]-1-amino)-carbonyloxycamptothecin (NPC), because of the oxidation
pathways. This process is mediated by CYP3A enzymes,
which results in potential drug-drug interactions.5
Because irinotecan has demonstrated clinical efficacy, albeit with substantial limitations, the development
of novel irinotecan analogs that can maintain good water
solubility, shift the equilibrium toward the active form of
the molecule, and reduce drug-drug interaction is a
rational objective. SN38 as a single agent has not been
used as an anticancer drug in humans because of its poor
solubility, which, however, can be vastly improved by
PEGylation.
EZN-2208 (polyethylene glycol [PEG]-SN38) is a
water-soluble PEGylated conjugate of SN38 that offers
potential therapeutic advantages over unmodified SN38
and irinotecan.6 EZN-2208 enables increased solubility,
parenteral delivery of SN38, longer circulating half-life,
higher exposure to the active drug (SN38), greater preservation of the active form at physiologic pH, and may
enhance the retention of molecules within tumors.7,8 In
preclinical studies, EZN-2208 was 10-fold to 245-fold
more potent than irinotecan in a panel of human tumor
cell lines.6 It is noteworthy that EZN-2208 exhibited
marked antitumor activity in animals that developed resistance to an 8-day course of irinotecan treatment and
outperformed irinotecan as second-round therapy in mice
that initially were sensitive to irinotecan.6 In addition,
EZN-2208 did not exhibit drug-drug interaction and had
prolonged circulation in the blood compared with irinotecan, resulting in greater tumor exposure.6,9 In the study
reported here, we evaluated the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), and preliminary evidence of activity
of EZN-2208 in patients with advanced malignancies.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Eligibility Criteria

To be eligible, patients had to be aged 18 years; have
measurable metastatic or advanced malignancies that were
not amenable to established forms of therapy; be willing
to be tested for uridine diphosphate glucuronosyltransferase 1 family, polypeptide A1 (UGT1A1) genotype; and
have an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 to 210 and adequate hematologic, hepatic,
and renal function. Patients who were pregnant or had
chronic enteropathies, symptomatic central nervous system tumor involvement, and unstable or uncompensated
Cancer

respiratory, cardiac, hepatic, or renal disease or any other
organ system dysfunction were excluded. Treatment with
P450 CYP3A4 enzyme-inducing anticonvulsant drugs
during and within 14 days of study day 1 and chemotherapy, immunotherapy, radiotherapy, and investigational
agents during and within 4 weeks of study day 1 and prior
wide-field radiotherapy (>25% of bone marrow) were
prohibited. Institutional Review Board approval and written informed consent were obtained before study-related
procedures were started. This trial is registered with ClinTrials.gov as National Clinical Trial NCT00520637.
Study Design

This phase 1, open-label study used a ‘‘3 þ 3’’ design
followed by an expansion phase. The starting dose, 1.25
mg/m2, was calculated based on 1-sixth of the maximum
tolerated dose (MTD) observed in beagle dogs. Escalation
by dose doubling was performed for 3 dose levels
(2.5 mg/m2, 5.0 mg/m2, and 10 mg/m2), after which a
modified Fibonacci escalation scheme (ie, dose increases
of 67%, 50%, 40%, and 33%) was used to guide dose
increases.11 ENZ-2208 was administered by intravenous
infusion with or without granulocyte-colony–stimulating
factor (G-CSF) for approximately 1 hour once every 21
days. Patients remained on study until disease progression, death, unacceptable toxicity, or withdrawal of
consent. Dose adjustments and/or delays were permitted
to allow for patient tolerability.
Patients who were homozygous for the UGT1A1*28
polymorphism were evaluated in separate cohorts starting
at 2 dose levels below the dose level of the cohort that was
being enrolled at that time; the MTD was not determined
for these patients. Dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) that
occurred in patients who were homozygous for
UGT1A1*28 were not used to establish the MTD in
patients who were not homozygous for UGT1A1*28.
Dose-Limiting Toxicity and Maximum Tolerated
Dose

DLT was defined as any of the following occurring during
cycle 1 that were treatment-emergent and possibly related
to EZN-2208: febrile neutropenia, grade 4 neutropenia
lasting 5 days, grade 4 thrombocytopenia, any grade 3
or 4 nonhematologic toxicity except grade 3 laboratory
abnormalities that were transient (<24 hours) and grade
3 or 4 nausea and vomiting. If 2 of 6 patients at a
dose level developed a DLT, then that dose level was considered to be above the MTD. The MTD was the next
lower dose level, provided that 1 of 6 patients in that
cohort developed DLT.

Evaluation of Safety

Adverse events were recorded for patients who received at
least 1 dose of EZN-2208. Severity was assessed according
to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology
Criteria for Adverse Events (version 3.0).
Physical examinations and vital signs were measured
before infusion on day 1 of each cycle. Electrocardiograms
were obtained during the first infusion at the following
time points: before infusion; 10 minutes before the end of
infusion; and 1 hour, 4 hours, and 24 hours after the end
of infusion. Subsequent electrocardiograms were obtained
during the study as clinically indicated. Regular monitoring of hematology and blood chemistry occurred weekly,
and urinalysis was performed at the beginning of each 21day cycle.
Pharmacokinetics

Plasma samples for PK characterization were collected
before infusion; 15 minutes after the start of infusion; 1
hour after the start of infusion (end of infusion); at 90
minutes, 2 hours, 4 hours, 8 hours, 24 hours, 48 hours,
72 hours, 96 hours, 120 hours, and 168 hours after the
end of infusion on day 1 of cycle 1; once on day 15 of
cycle 1; and before infusion on day 1 of cycle 2. The
EZN-2208 concentration was determined using a validated high-performance liquid chromatography method.6
Plasma concentrations of SN38 and glucuronidated
SN38 (SN38G) were determined by validated high-performance liquid chromatography using fluorescent detection.6 To determine the PEG-SN38 concentration,
plasma pH was raised to 8.0  0.5 with sodium carbonate
buffer, and the sample was incubated at 30 C for 24 hours
to liberate SN38 using ester bond hydrolysis. The sample
was then acidified with citric acid, extracted, and analyzed
for SN38 by high-performance liquid chromatography.
The concentration of PEG-SN38 was determined by subtraction of the free SN38 measured originally from the
total concentration SN38 using the hydrolysis method.
Data were analyzed using the nonlinear mixed-effect
modeling software program Monolix version 31s (available at: http://wfn.software.monolix.org [accessed May 8,
2012])12 using a population PK approach. Parameters
were estimated by computing the maximum likelihood estimator of the parameters without any approximation of
the model (no linearization) using the stochastic approximation expectation maximization algorithm combined to
a Markov Chain Monte Carlo procedure.13
A proportional model was used to describe the residual variability, and the between-subject variabilities (g)
were ascribed to an exponential model. Specific tests com6146

paring the log-likelihood, the Akaike information criterion, and the Bayesian information criterion were
performed to test different hypotheses regarding the final
model, the effect of covariate(s) on PK parameter(s), residual variability model (proportional vs proportional
plus additive error model), and structure of the variancecovariance matrix for the between-subject variability
parameters.
For SN38G, we developed a model to describe
SN38G time-courses and to derive apparent parameters
of free SN38G disposition. The infused SN38 dose and
SN38G were converted in molar units for this analysis,
assuming that 1 mol SN38 was metabolized to 1 mol
SN38G.
For SN38 and SN38G, the clearance and volume
parameters, thus, were apparent: (CL or Q)/Fm and (Vc
or VP)/Fm, where Fm is the unknown metabolic fraction,
CL is the elimination clearance, Q is the intercompartmental clearance, and Vc and Vp are central and peripheral volumes of distribution, respectively. The clearance
and volume are apparent because the true bioavailability
of SN38 and SN38G from their precursors, PEG-SN38
and SN38, respectively, is not known for the modeling.
UGT1A1 Genotype Assessment

The UGT1A1*28 genotype is associated with more toxicity after irinotecan.14 Patients who were homozygous for
UGT1A1*28 received 5.0 mg/m2 EZN-2280. Therefore,
we analyzed UGT1A1 polymorphisms. A blood sample
used to determine UGT1A1 genotype was collected from
each patient at baseline. One venous sample (5 mL) of
blood was collected into a tube containing potassium ethylene diamine tetraacetic acid. Genotyping for UGT1A1
was performed by polymerase chain reaction analysis
using the UGT1A1 GenotypR PCR/Capillary Electrophoresis Assay, which detects the 4 polymorphisms
*36(TA5), *1(TA6), *28(TA7), and *37(TA8) (Quest
Diagnostics Nichols Institute of Valencia, Valencia,
Calif).
Evaluation of Efficacy

Treatment efficacy was evaluated by computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging studies according to
version 1.0 of Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid
Tumors15 before treatment and every 6 to 8 weeks thereafter. Briefly, a complete response was defined as the disappearance of all lesions, a partial response was defined as
a reduction 30% in the sum of the greatest dimensions
of the lesions, stable disease was defined as a decrease
30% and an increase 20% in the greatest dimensions
of the lesions, and progressive disease was defined as an

RESULTS
Patient Characteristics

Thirty-nine patients were treated across 3 study centers in
the United States (The University of Texas MD Anderson
Cancer Center [Houston, Tex], Northwestern University
Feinberg School of Medicine [Chicago, Ill], and Albert
Einstein Cancer Center [Bronx, NY]). Demographics and
clinical characteristics at study entry are summarized in
Table 1. The median age of treated patients was 58 years
(range, 24-78 years); 23 patients (59%) were women, and
72% had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 1. The most common cancer type was
colorectal cancer (14 patients; 36%). Three patients each
(8% each) had breast, head and neck, and pancreatic cancers. The median time to treatment from initial diagnosis
of cancer was 2.5 years (range, 0.3-17 years). The median
number of prior therapies was 2 (range, 0-10 prior therapies). Seventeen patients (44%) had received prior
irinotecan.
Dose Escalation

Patients were enrolled sequentially into the following
EZN-2208 dose cohorts: 1.25 mg/m2, 2.5 mg/m2, 5.0
mg/m2, 10.0 mg/m2, 16.5 mg/m2, and 25.0 mg/m2. At
the 16.5 mg/m2 dose, 2 patients experienced a first-cycle
DLT of febrile neutropenia (Table 2). The protocol was
modified to allow prophylactic administration of myeloid
growth factors (G-CSF) during the first cycle, and further
dose escalation proceeded starting at the EZN-2208 dose
of 16.5 mg/m2. Therefore, 2 MTDs were defined: The
first MTD was determined in patients who were not
receiving prophylactic administration of G-CSF during
the first cycle, and the second MTD was determined in
patients who were receiving prophylactic administration
of G-CSF during the first cycle. Of the 39 treated
patients, 27 patients received EZN-2208 without firstcycle G-CSF according to the original protocol, and 12
patients received EZN-2208 with first-cycle G-CSF
according to protocol amendment. All 39 patients were
included in safety and efficacy evaluations.

Dose-Limiting Toxicities and Maximum
Tolerated Dose

The DLT was grade 3 or 4 febrile neutropenia, which was
reported in 2 of 6 patients who received 16.5 mg/m2
EZN-2208 without G-CSF and in 2 of 6 patients who
received 25 mg/m2 EZN-2208 with G-CSF. Therefore,
we determined that the MTD and recommended phase 2
doses for EZN-2208 were 10 mg/m2 without G-CSF and
16.5 mg/m2 with G-CSF. The MTD cohorts were
expanded to 10 patients and 6 patients, respectively, and
no further DLTs were observed.
Safety

All 39 patients received at least 1 dose of EZN-2208 and
were evaluated for safety. The most common toxicities
that likely were related to study drug were fatigue (41%);

alopecia, diarrhea, and nausea (33% each); neutropenia
(23%); and vomiting (21%). Most were reported in
patients who received EZN-2208 at doses 10 mg/m2
(Table 2). The most common drug-related toxicities with
a worst grade of 3 or 4 were neutropenia (18%) and febrile
neutropenia (10%). Treatment-emergent diarrhea was
reported for 13 patients and was grade 1 in 10 patients,
grade 2 in 2 patients, and grade 3 in 1 patient (this was
not considered a DLT by the investigator, because the
patient had been noncompliant about taking prophylactic
antidiarrheal medication).
UGT1A1 Polymorphisms

SN38 is inactivated by the addition of a glucuronide
moiety by UGT1A1, the activity of which is reduced in
individuals who have genetic polymorphisms like
UGT1A1*28.16,17 Patients who are heterozygous or
homozygous for UGT1A1*28 may have a lower than normal capacity to metabolize irinotecan and are at greater
risk for adverse effects associated with the use of standard
doses of irinotecan14 and, presumably, SN38. The
UGT1A1 genotype was *1/*28 in 18 patients (46%),
*1/*1 in 17 patients (44%), *28/*28 (homozygous) in
2 patients (5%), *1/*37 in 1 patient (3%), and *28/*36 in
1 patient (3%) (Table 1).
6148

The 2 patients who were homozygous for UGT1A1*28
received a dose of 5 mg/m2 EZN-2208. The toxicities that
were at least possibly related to study drug in these patients
were grade 2 fatigue (n ¼ 1) and grade 4 dyspnea (n ¼ 1).
Patients who were heterozygous for UGT1A1*28 received a
range of dose levels up to and beyond the MTD, and they
experienced the following toxicities, which were at least possibly related to study drug: grade 1/2 diarrhea, fatigue, nausea,
vomiting, onychoclasis, alopecia, constipation, headache,
anemia, dysgeusia, lymphopenia, leukopenia, neutropenia,
thrombocytopenia; and grade 3 or 4 leukopenia (n ¼ 1),
lymphopenia (n ¼ 1), neutropenia (n ¼ 1), febrile neutropenia (n ¼ 2), and thrombocytopenia (n ¼ 2).
Pharmacokinetics

Data for all 39 treated patients were included in the PK
analysis. PK parameters for SN38 are summarized by dose
level in Table 3. The terminal half-life for SN38 ranged
from 21.41 hours to 26 hours. The PK of plasma EZN2208 (PEG-SN38) and its active metabolite SN38 in
patients were described satisfactorily by a 2-compartment,
open model with linear elimination. Mean  standard
deviation PK estimates (Bayesian approach) for EZN2208, SN38, and SN38G are summarized in Table 4.
The overall mean terminal-phase elimination halflife of EZN-2208 after infusion was 19.4  3.4 hours

The elimination half-life is defined as V1*log(2)/CL.

(Table 4). The SN38 clearance was 11.2 L/hour. For
EZN-2208, a very high fraction of the area under the receiver operating concentration curve was associated with
the b phase, with a corresponding central volume of distribution that was rather small and close to the circulating
blood volume (Table 4). This suggests that the major part
of the parent drug is restrained in the circulation space
with weak tissue diffusion; whereas, for free SN38, the
volume of distribution is very high, indicating a significant tissue diffusion of the active metabolite (free SN38).
In a combined analysis of data from studies EZN2208-01 (ClincalTrials.gov identifier NCT00520637)
and
EZN-2208-02
(ClinTrials.gov
identifier
NCT00520390), 2 covariate effects on EZN-2208 PK
were significant, including a body-weight effect based on
allometric rule and patient sex (data on file; Enzon Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Piscataway Township, NJ). This indicates that EZN-2208 and SN38 clearances are lower in
women than in men (0.16 L/hour vs 0.24 L/hour). Moreover, there is a significant effect of serum creatinine concentration on the free SN38 clearance.

Efficacy

All 39 treated patients were included in the efficacy evaluation. Response data were available for 35 patients as follows: Thirty-three patients had at least 1 post-treatment
imaging evaluation, and 2 patients came off study early
for clinical progression. The remaining 4 patients were
not re-evaluated by post-treatment imaging studies for the
following reasons: withdrawal of consent (n ¼ 3) and
adverse event (dyspnea; n ¼ 1). These patients were considered treatment failures.
The best overall responses (n ¼ 39) are illustrated in
Figure 1. Sixteen of 39 patients (41%) achieved a best
response of stable disease, including 6 patients (15%) who
had stable disease that lasted for 4 months, with a longest duration of 8.5 months (this was a patient with sinonasal adenocarcinoma who received 25 mg/m2 EZN2208 plus G-CSF). One patient with cholangiocarcinoma
had a 32% tumor regression in target lesions; however,
the regression was transient. Among the 6 patients who
had stable disease that lasted for 4 months, 3 had
received prior irinotecan; and of those 3, 1 patient had

DISCUSSION
EZN-2208 administered as an intravenous infusion once
every 3 weeks was well tolerated at doses up to and including 10 mg/m2 without G-CSF and up to and including
16.5 mg/m2 with G-CSF. The primary DLTs were febrile
neutropenia. Irinotecan has significant side effects that
generally are attributed to SN38, including acute and
delayed, severe diarrhea and neutropenia.18 In the current
study, the most frequently observed drug-related toxicities
were fatigue (41%); alopecia, diarrhea, and nausea (33%
each); neutropenia (23%); and vomiting (21%). The
most common drug-related toxicities with a worst grade
of 3 or 4 were neutropenia (18%) and febrile neutropenia
(10%), and most occurrences were observed at doses of
10 mg/m2. Unlike irinotecan, patients who received
EZN-2208 did not exhibit dose-limiting diarrhea,
although diarrhea was present in 13 of 39 patients (33%).
Overall, a review of safety data did not suggest any unexpected safety signal, given that EZN-2208 carries SN38,
the active moiety of irinotecan.
It is believed that individuals who are heterozygous
or homozygous for the UGT1A1*28 allele are at increased
risk for adverse effects, especially neutropenia, after initia6150

tion of irinotecan treatment, because the UGT1A1*28 allele is believed to confer reduced UGT1A1-mediated
inactivation of SN38.18,19 Nineteen of the 39 treated
patients in our study had a UGT1A1 genotype that was
heterozygous for the *28 allele. Of these 19 patients, 4
had treatment-emergent toxicity consisting of grade 2 to 4
neutropenia (2 associated with fever at doses of 25 mg/m2
with G-CSF) that probably was related to study drug.
Two of 39 patients (5%) had a homozygous (*28/*28)
UGT1A1 genotype, and both of these patients received
EZN-2208 doses of 5 mg/m2. Neutropenia was not
observed in 1 of these patients. For the other patient, hematology laboratory results in the weeks after EZN-2208
administration were not available because of the occurrence of (probably drug-related) grade 4 dyspnea, which
resulted in early discontinuation of the study drug.
The PK of plasma EZN-2208 (PEG-SN38) and its
active metabolite SN38 in patients were described satisfactorily by a 2-compartment, open model with linear elimination. Two covariate effects were significant on EZN2208, including a body weight effect based on allometric
rule and patient sex. This indicates that EZN-2208 and
SN38 clearances are lower in women than in men. Moreover, there is a significant effect of serum creatinine concentration on the free SN38 clearance. The PK of EZN-2208
had a mean terminal-phase elimination half-life range of

21.41 to 60.28 hours after infusion and appeared to be
dose-dependent. The SN38 clearance was 6.1 L/hour.
In this heavily pretreated patient population
(including 17 patients who had previously failed irinotecan therapy), treatment with EZN-2208 was associated
with stable disease that lasted for 4 months in 6 patients
(15%; including 3 who had received prior irinotecan). In
addition, 1 patient with cholangiocarcinoma (who had
not received prior irinotecan) who received an EZN-2208
dose of 16.5 mg/m2 plus G-CSF achieved a short-lived
32% tumor reduction in target lesions.
In summary, EZN-2208 administered intravenously once every 3 weeks at 10 mg/m2 without G-CSF
or at 16.5 mg/m2 with G-CSF was well tolerated. The
results from the trial reported here are similar to preliminary data recently reported for another phase 1 trial of
EZN-2208 in which the study drug was administered as a
1-hour intravenous infusion weekly for 3 weeks per each
4-week cycle.20 In that study, EZN-2208 also was generally well tolerated in patients with advanced malignancies;
common side effects were nausea (49%), diarrhea and fatigue (44% each), alopecia (30%), neutropenia (28%),
and vomiting (28%). The DLT for EZN-2208 in that
study was neutropenia (with or without fever), and febrile
neutropenia also was our predominant DLT.
The current results indicate that further investigation of EZN-2208 in patients with solid tumors is warranted. Two phase 2 studies evaluating EZN-2208 in
patients with metastatic colorectal cancer and metastatic
breast cancer are ongoing.
