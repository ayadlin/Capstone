ABSTRACT:

The National Cancer Institute has announced 24 provocative questions on cancer.
Why do many cancer cells die when suddenly deprived of a protein encoded by an
oncogene? Can we extend patient survival by using approaches that keep tumors
static? Why are some disseminated cancers cured by chemotherapy alone? Can we
develop methods to rapidly test interventions for cancer treatment or prevention?
Can we use our knowledge of aging to enhance prevention or treatment of cancer?
What is the mechanism by which some drugs commonly and chronically used for
other indications protect against cancer? How does obesity contribute to cancer
risk? Here I try to answer these questions by linking the dots of existing knowledge.

INTRODUCTION

PQ-22: Why do many cancer cells die when
suddenly deprived of a protein encoded by an
oncogene?

As announced by the NCI director Harold E. Varmus,
answers to these perplexing questions will revolutionize
prevention and treatment of cancer. How does obesity
contribute to cancer risk? What is the mechanism by
which some drugs commonly and chronically used for
other indications protect against cancer? Can we use our
knowledge of aging to enhance prevention or treatment
of cancer? Can we develop methods to rapidly test
interventions for cancer treatment or prevention? Why are
some disseminated cancers cured by chemotherapy alone?
Can we extend patient survival by using approaches that
keep tumors static? Why do many cancer cells die when
suddenly deprived of a protein encoded by an oncogene?

What these questions have in common is that they
cannot be answered by a single experiment. Knowledge
from different fields needs to be brought together and
seemingly unrelated facts to be linked. Then predictions
can be tested by retrieving published data (virtual
experiments) [1, 2]. Here are answers to some questions.
Since the order of questions was arbitrary, I have rearranged questions, keeping the original numbers.

Oncogene addiction is dependence on oncogene,
even though this oncogene was not needed before its
activation [3-31]. For example, transfection of Bcr-Abl
renders HL-60 cells apoptosis-reluctant, resistant to
killing by most anti-cancer drugs [28, 32, 33]. In contrast,
the Bcr-Abl inhibitor imatinib kills Bcr-Abl-transfected
cells without affecting parental cells. Parental cells neither
have Bcr-Abl nor need Bcr-Abl to start with. So why
losing Bcr-Abl is detrimental but not having Bcr-Abl at all
is not. Bcr-Abl inhibits apoptosis and therefore some other
anti-apoptotic proteins become redundant. For example,
while Bcl-2 is over expressed in HL-60 cells, it is not
expressed in HL60/Bcr-Abl cells [34, 35]. (By the way,
this also explains why Bcl-2 (and p53) status does not
correlate with cell propensity to apoptosis (see [36-38]).
The Bcr-Abl addiction can be described by the dam
model [39]. Bcr-Abl is ‘a dam on the pro-apoptotic river’.
Pro-apoptotic molecules accumulate upstream of the
dam. For example, hyper-active caspase-9 was detected
in Bcr-Abl-expressing HL-60 cells [40]. When BcrAbl is suddenly removed, then apoptotic signals “flow”
downstream, causing a flood [39, 40].
Let us make a generalization: Activation or

over-activation of a pro-survival pathway may lead to
deactivation of an alternative (and redundant) pro-survival
pathway(s) because of redundancy (Figure 1, oncogene
addiction).
Now we can connect two dots: Oncogene addiction
(OA) and synthetic lethality (SL). Two genes are synthetic
lethal if mutation of either alone is compatible with
viability but mutation of both leads to death [19, 41-44].
At first glance, OA and SL are different phenomena. Yet,
the difference between OA and SL is the sequence of
events and … our knowledge about these events.
In synthetic lethality, gene B (or process B) is
inactivated first (Figure 1). This renders cell dependent
on gene A (or process A). In oncogene addiction, gene
A is overactivated first and gene B is inactivated later.
Oncogene addiction (OA) is a mirror image of synthetic
lethality (SL). The distinction between SL and OA depends
on our knowledge of the sequence of events. When we
introduce an oncogene, this is oncogene addiction. But
what about natural oncogene-dependent tumors. Is that
OA or SL? We cannot distinguish them. In other words,
OA is SL and vice versa, depending on our point of view.
For example, in OA gene A is known. In SL, we screen for
gene A using agents that toxic to such cells. (Note: instead
of gene, there might be a pathway or a process such as
glycolysis, oxidative or protetoxic stress [45-47]. We use
the word gene for brevity. )
In natural tumors, oncogene addiction is a
consequence of selection for resistance to restrictive,
growth-limiting conditions, when resistance is conferred
by oncogene A. Definition: oncogenic resistance is
resistance to cytostatic/cytotoxic agents based on
oncogenic alterations such as loss of p53 or expression of
Bcr-Abl, which renders cells both resistant and malignant
[48]). But then the oncogenic cell may lose redundant
pathway/gene B, therefore becoming addicted to oncogene
A. Thus, oncogene addiction (or synthetic lethality) and

oncogenic resistance are two sides of the same coin.

PQ-21: Given the appearance of resistance in
response to cell killing therapies, can we extend
survival by using approaches that keep tumors
static?
Will static drugs cause resistance? The answer is
yes. Anything that is cytostatic must select for resistance.
Sensitive cells get arrested, whereas rare resistant
cells selectively proliferate. But this does not preclude
successful therapy. Furthermore, selection for resistance
is a consequence of successful treatment that keeps
most cells static. In comparison, antibiotics (especially
cytostatic agents) effectively select for resistance in
bacteria. But still antibiotics are very useful. Compared
with bacteria, mutation rates and cell numbers and
mutation rate are relatively lower in cancer and resistant
cancer cells do not spread to new patients (so acquired
resistance always is acquired de novo).
While arresting sensitive cancer cells, static drugs
select for resistant cancer cells. So therapy that effectively
arrest tumor growth must select for resistance. Fortunately,
any anticancer drugs including static drugs can select
for resistance, only by causing therapeutic response due
to arresting or killing non-resistant cells. Unfortunately,
when resistance arises, resistant cancer cells tend to be
more malignant and aggressive. This is because resistance
can be oncogenic [48]. Therefore, therapeutic response
often does not prolong life of cancer patient [49].
But here is a solution. In resistant tumors, we
can select for drug sensitivity using antagonistic drug
combinations [50]. Antagonistic combinations may be
comprised of a toxic drug and a static drug that antagonizes
(blocks) the toxic drug. If cells are (or become) resistant
to the static drug, the toxic drug will kill them. Of course,
the entire combination selects for resistance but this is
resistance to the entire combination [50]. Yet resistance
to the entire combination can be achieved by selection
for sensitivity to the static drug. Such antagonistic
combinations selectively eliminate resistant cancer cells
in cell culture [51-56].
Furthermore, if normal cells are sensitive to a static
drug but resistant cancer cells are not, then resistant cancer
cells could be eliminated without toxic side effects. This
links two dots: (a) prevention of resistance by antagonistic
combinations and (b) protection of normal cells from
chemotherapy. Normal cells can be protected from cell
cycle-dependent chemotherapy by pre-treatment with
cytostatic agents [56-62] and also by agents that block
cell death selectively in normal cells [54, 63-68]. This
strategy was discussed in detail [69-72]. Most importantly,
drug combinations that selectively kill resistant cancer
cells, while sparing normal cells, can be designed using

currently available drugs [62, 71, 73].
So will static drugs cause resistance? The answer
is yes. But can they extend patient survival (despite
appearance of resistance). The answer is also yes. Yes,
if additional therapeutic modalities (such as antagonistic
combinations and protection of normal cells) will be used
in sequence [74].

endometrial.
Apoptosis is a marker of therapeutic response and
curable malignancies are prone to undergo apoptosis
in response to therapy [97-105]. (Note: it has been
emphasized that in most cancers apoptosis is not a
predictive marker of therapeutic response [106-109].
Apoptosis is not important for therapy of such cancers,
simply because these cancers are apoptosis-reluctant
[110, 111]. These are the same common cancers that are
not curable by chemotherapy alone. One may suggest that
these cancers are not curable exactly because apoptosis is
not a primary response to chemotherapy or in other words
because they are apoptosis-reluctant.
In contrast, curable disseminated cancers are
apoptosis-prone. Testicular germ cell tumors are unique in
their excellent response to DNA-damaging chemotherapy.
Hypersensitivity of testicular tumors to etoposide-induced
apoptosis is associated with functional p53 [112]. In
cancer with overexpressed Mdm2, nutlin-3a induces p53
and apoptosis [113]. Similarly, testicular cancer easily
undergo apoptosis in response to p53 induced by cisplatin.
Resistance to cisplatin is linked to p53 mutation [114,
115]. Relapsed tumors are resistant to therapy [116].
2. Curable cancers arise without lengthy selection
and progression. A few mutations may be sufficient for
dissemination of these particular cancers (see feature 3)
but they did not acquire resistance associated with tumor
progression.
A peculiar example of cancer-like condition
represents endometriosis, growth of normal endometrial
cells, resembling malignant processes, including invasive
growth and distant implantation. Oncogenic mutations
are absent or very rare [117]. Medulloblastoma, the most
common malignant brain tumor of children [118] has
lower genetic alterations compared to adult solid tumors.
3. Curable disseminated cancers arise from tissues
that “normally metastasize” (hematopoietic/lymphoid)
and invasive (the placenta) and highly proliferative. So
they can become disseminated with minimal number of
mutations and without tumor-progression.

PQ-19: Why are some disseminated cancers cured
by chemotherapy alone?
Let us first discuss why most disseminated cancers
are NOT cured by chemotherapy alone? First, common
cancers such as lung, colorectal, breast, prostate,
pancreatic, renal, thyroid cancers are age-related diseases,
which occur late in life. During lifespan pre-malignant
and malignant cells acquire mutations, undergo multiple
rounds of selection and replication [75-80]. Cancer cells
accumulate hundreds of mutations that render them
oncogenic, abolishing cell death and cycle arrest [78, 8192]. Not surprisingly, they are also intrinsically resistant
to chemotherapy. Furthermore, chemotherapy itself causes
selection for resistance, which is associated with more
malignant and aggressive phenotype and acceleration of
tumor growth [49, 93, 94].
Second, these cancers arise from normal tissues
resistant to therapy to start with. For example, side effects
of chemotherapy are not prominent in breast and lung
tissues compared with bone marrow. Why would breast
and lung cancer be more sensitive to chemotherapy
than bone marrow? Even further, apoptosis-avoidance
is a hallmark of cancer, so these cancer cells must be
even more resistant than their normal counterparts.
Not surprisingly, therapeutic window is low. (Note:
as we discussed, oncogenes confer resistance to some
chemotherapy on the cost of oncogene addiction, which
could be exploited for therapy).
Third, metastasis may require mutations beyond
those required for primary tumors [82]. These additional
oncogenic changes may contribute to resistance of
disseminated cancers. For example, in pancreatic cancer,
at least a decade separates the occurrence of the initiating
mutation and the birth of the parental, non-metastatic
founder cell. And at least five more years are required
for the acquisition of metastatic ability and patients die
an average of two years thereafter [95]. So cancer cells
undergo long selection for fitness and oncogenic resistance
[80, 96].
However, some cancers are highly sensitive to
chemotherapy. Examples include testicular cancer,
gestational choriocarcinoma, some lymphomas, childhood
malignancies such as Wilms tumors. These cancers share
three features.

such as lymphoid, testicular, embryonic and placental/

PQ-17: Since current methods to assess potential
cancer treatments are cumbersome, expensive,
and often inaccurate, can we develop other
methods to rapidly test interventions for cancer
treatment or prevention?
Although different cell culture methods can be
suggested, they probably would share something in
common: these rapid methods will be unaesthetic.
Currently, many methods are based on evenly plated
cells in relatively low cell densities. In control, cells are
beautifully healthy. It is easy to observe spectacular effects
of drugs that induce apoptosis and senescence. However,
almost everything in these methods is artificial. (the only

a. In the organism, cells exist in very high densities.
b. 21% oxygen used in cell culture does not exist in
the body, only in the air. In tumors oxygen levels are 0.
1-3%.
c. Cancer cells are usually cultured in high-glucose
DME, with levels of glucose 5 fold higher than blood
glucose levels.
d. In real tumors, levels of lactate are very high and
pH is low.
Yet, hypoglycemic/hypoxic condition in vitro
mimicking the tumor microenvironment markedly reduced
the efficacy of anticancer drugs [119]. In the high cell
density in hypoxia model, cancer cells lose viability due
to self-poisoning with lactic acid. Some anti-cancer agents
actually increase cell viability [120]. Overgrown, “yellow”
cell cultures in hypoxic conditions may mimic in vivo
environment.

factors [145-154]. Second, mTOR overactivation can
cause insulin resistance [155-159], which in turn leads
to a compensatory increase in insulin levels, which can
promote cancer. Third, signal-resistance, irresponsiveness
and loss of regenerative potential of the aging normal
cells create a selective pressure to bypass the need for
growth-signals and bypass cell cycle block. Unable to
respond to physiological stimuli, normal cells are in
disadvantage, unable to compete with premalignant cells.
Cells with oncogenic mutations and loss of cell cycle
control (due to mutations in p53, p16 and Rb) selectively
proliferate. In other words, due to irresponsiveness of
aging normal cells to mitogenic signals and decreased
regenerative potential of aging cells, there is a selective
advantage for transformed cells, which are autonomous
and lack cell cycle checkpoints. For example, declining
lymphoid progenitor fitness promotes aging-associated
leukemogenesis [160, 161]. I suggest that restoration of
signal-sensitivity and responsiveness of normal cells by
pulse (intermittent) treatment with rapamycin can abolish
selective advantage for cancer cells.
Thus, at least 3 mechanisms of how mTORdriven aging can contribute to cancer. This predicts that
suppression of aging of normal cells by rapamycin will
extend lifespan and delay cancer. In fact, numerous data
support this prediction (see PQ-5). Noteworthy, rapamycin
is not intended to directly affect cancer cells. It is intended
to suppress geroconversion (suppress aging of normal
cells). As a gerosuppressant, rapamycin will be used in
low doses and in pulses, thus precluding side effects [162,
163].
In summary, the incidence of common cancers
such as breast, prostate, colon, lung, pancreatic, gastric,
bladder and certain leukemias is increased with age.
Conditions that accelerate aging such as obesity also
accelerate cancer, whereas slow aging is associated with
delayed cancer. One can suggest that pharmacological
interventions that slow down organismal aging will delay
or prevent cancer. It was demonstrated that mTOR is
involved in cellular senescence, converting quiescence
into senescence (geroconversion). Importantly, mTOR is
involved in organismal aging and its inhibition extends
lifespan. Aging can be decelerated by rapamycin.

PQ-7: How does the lifespan of an organism affect
the molecular mechanisms of cancer development,
and can we use our deepening knowledge of aging
to enhance prevention or treatment of cancer?
What are cellular and molecular mechanisms linking
aging and cancer? And what is cellular aging?
In proliferating normal cells, growth factors (GF)
stimulate (a) cellular mass growth and metabolism and (b)
cell cycle progression. Cellular mass growth is balanced
by cell division. (Many signaling pathways that promote
mass growth and metabolism converge on mTOR, so
I will refer to them as the mTOR network or pathway).
In the absence of growth signals, the cell neither grows
nor cycles. This is quiescence [121, 122]. When the cell
cycle is blocked but mTOR is still active, then the arrested
cell becomes senescent [122-134]. mTOR renders cells
resistant to insulin and growth factors. As discussed in
detail, senescent cells are hypertrophic, hyperfunctional,
overactivated, pro-inflammatory and hypersecretory,
signal-resistant and lack the regenerative potential (the
inability to restart proliferation). Thus, mTOR converts
quiescence into senescence. This process could be
called gerogenic conversion or geroconversion [122].
Rapamycin slows down geroconversion. Rapamycin is a
gerosuppressant.
Furthermore, mTOR is involved in cell senescence
and stem cell exhaustion in the organism [135-140]. Also,
rapamycin reverses cellular phenotypes in HutchinsonGilford progeria syndrome cells [141]. Whereas calorie
restriction (CR) deactivates the nutrient-sensing mTOR
pathway [142], short-term CR suppresses cellular
senescence in the organism [143, 144].
There are 3 links between aging and cancer that are
in part mTOR-dependent.
First, senescent cells secrete pro-inflammatory
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

PQ-5: Given the evidence that some drugs
commonly and chronically used for other
indications, such as an anti-inflammatory
drug, can protect against cancer incidence and
mortality, can we determine the mechanism by
which any of these drugs work?
Some drugs commonly and chronically used for other
indications can protect against cancer. As announced by
NCI, elucidating the mechanisms by which these agents
work would be a major breakthrough in cancer prevention.
1355

Oncotarget 2011; 2: 1352 - 1367

Preclinical and clinical data suggest that certain
drugs used for diabetes, hypertension, atherosclerosis,
inflammation and immunossupression can protect against
cancer. These drugs include metformin, beta-blockers,
angiotensin-blockers, aspirin and rapamycin. Since
type II diabetes, hypertension, pro-inflammation and
atherosclerosis are all age-related diseases and conditions,
we can expect that these drugs may affect the aging
process. And since cancer is also an age-related disease,
conditions that slow down aging in turn delay or prevent
cancer. At doses used in the clinic for treatment of agerelated diseases, these accidental cancer-preventive agents
are relatively ineffective to treat cancer, implying that their
cancer-preventive effects are not due to targeting cancer
cells directly. Since the mTOR pathway is involved in
cellular and organismal aging and age-related diseases,
one can suggest that cancer preventive activities of
“accidental” drugs are in part due to suppression of aging.
Rapamycin decelerates geroconversion (conversion
of quiescence into senescence) in arrested cells [122-132].
Also rapamycin suppresses yeast aging and prolongs life
span in Drosophila and mice [164-183].
Finally, rapamycin prevents cancer in mice [178,
179, 184-192] and humans [193-196]. Given that mTOR
is the only one target of rapamycin, one can conclude that
inhibition of mTOR is sufficient to suppress aging and
delay cancer.
Metformin, an anti-diabetic drug, inhibits the
mTOR pathway [197-200]. Metformin and its analog
phenformin slow down aging, delay cancer and extend life
span in rodents [201-210]. Also metformin decreases the
risk of cancer in humans [206, 211-220].
Angiotensin-II-blockers. Inhibitors of angiotensin
II activity include ACE inhibitors (such as captopril and
lisinopril), which decrease angiotensin II production,
and angiotensin receptor blockers such as losratan.
Angiotensin-II-blockers
suppress
chemicallyinduced colon carcinogenesis in obese mice [221],
hepatocarcinogenesis in rats [222] and metastasis in mice
[222-224]. In humans, use of these drugs is associated
with a lower incidence of cancer occurrence [225, 226]. In
patients with renal transplantation, the use of angiotensinII-blockers is associated with a two-fold reduced risk of
skin cancers [227].
Angiotensin-II activates mTOR pathway and causes
cellular hypertrophy [228-236]. Therefore, angiotensinII-blockers, which prevent these effects, are indirect
inhibitors of mTOR.
Beta-blockers, which are used for therapy of
hypertension, prevent breast cancer [237-242]. There are
several publications that activators of beta-androgenic
receptors can activate the mTOR pathway [243-245].
Therefore, beta-blockers are expected too block mTOR
activation. This requires further investigations.
Aspirin decreases cancer incidence in humans

www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

[246-252]. As an anti-inflammatory agent, it decreases
an important hallmark of aging. The effect of aspirin on
gerogenic-signaling pathways such as mTOR needs to be
studied in the organism. In some cell models, salicylate
inhibits phosphorylation of S6, a downstream target of
mTOR/S6K [253].

PQ-1: How does obesity contribute to cancer risk?
Summary: The simplest answer is that obesity
promotes cancer by over-activating the nutrient-sensing
mTOR pathway, which is involved in obesity, aging and
cancer. Cancer is an age-related disease and accelerated
aging promotes cancer. High-calorie diet and obesity
activate mTOR, thus promoting aging and cancer.
Rapamycin increases lifespan in mice including cancerprone mice and prevents cancer in part by slowing down
aging. Given that rapamycin is a clinically approved drug,
it can be used in low doses to prevent cancer in obese
patients. Thus, one can suggest not only how obesity
contributes to cancer risk but also a therapeutic strategy
for cancer prevention.
How obesity and cancer might be linked
Many studies have documented an increased risk
of cancer incidence and mortality in individuals who are
obese [254-260]. What are mechanisms that underlie this
risk? There are causative and correlative links between
obesity and cancer.
Causative links: obesity promotes cancer
First, several factors secreted by the adipose tissue
can directly stimulate tumor growth. Second, obesity
causes hormonal changes such as insulinemia and insulin
promotes cancer. Third, as we will discuss, obesity can
accelerate aging and aging promotes cancer.
Correlative links: both obesity and cancer are
promoted by a common cause
First, aging is a major risk factor for cancer and is
associated with visceral obesity. Second, high-calorie
diet can promote both obesity and cancer. Yet, even these
correlative relationships are causative on a deeper level,
sharing a common molecular mechanism that links aging,
cancer and obesity. Thus, the same pathway (such as
mTOR) may be involved in aging, obesity and cancer per
se, as well as aging and obesity can mutually stimulate
each other (via the mTOR pathway) and both of them
play causative role in cancer (Figure 2). Pharmacological
inhibition of such a common pathway will prevent or
delay cancer. What are molecular changes induced by
obesity that actually promote cancer development?
Dot 1. Nutrients and insulin activate mTOR, whereas
calorie restriction (fasting) deactivates mTOR [142, 156,
261-266].
Dot 2. The mTOR pathway promotes obesity and is
activated in obesity [256, 261, 265, 268-272].
Dot 3. mTOR is involved in cellular aging [1221356

effects. It could be used for cancer prevention in obese
patients with multiple age-related pathologies and could be
combined with diet, physical exercise, aspirin, metformin,
beta-blockers, angiotensin-blockers and lipid-lowering
drugs. Then cancer can be delayed by staying young.

Noteworthy, basal (fasting) levels of mTOR activity is
increased in old mice [266].
Taken together (dots 1-3) these data predict that
obesity would accelerate aging and age-related diseases,
thus shortening life span. This prediction does not need to
be tested. It is too well known that: Obesity accelerates all
age-related diseases.

exactly the starting point (PQ-1).

slowing down the aging process. In fact, rapamycin
prevents cancer in mice [178, 184-192] and humans [193196].
