Abstract
The development of therapeutic strategies which induce
effective cellular antitumor immunity represents an important
goal in cancer immunology. Here, we used the unique features
of the genetically engineered Hgf-Cdk4R24C mouse model to
identify a combination chemoimmunotherapy for melanoma.
These mice develop primary cutaneous melanomas which
grow progressively and metastasize in the absence of immunogenic foreign proteins such as oncogenes or antigens.
Primary and metastatic tumors evade innate and adaptive
immune defenses, although they naturally express melanocytic
antigens which can be recognized by antigen-specific T cells.
We found that primary melanomas continued to grow despite
infiltration with adoptively transferred, in vivo–activated,
tumor-specific CD8+ T cells. To promote tumor immune
defense, we developed a treatment protocol consisting of four
complementary components: (a) chemotherapeutic preconditioning prior to (b) adoptive lymphocyte transfer and (c) viral
vaccination followed by (d) adjuvant peritumoral injections of
immunostimulatory nucleic acids. Lymphocyte ablation and
innate antiviral immune stimulation cooperatively enhanced
the expansion and the effector cell differentiation of adoptively transferred lymphocytes. The efficacy of the different
treatment approaches converged in the tumor microenvironment and induced a strong cytotoxic inflammatory response
enabling preferential recognition and destruction of melanoma cells. This combination chemoimmunotherapy caused
complete regression of advanced primary melanomas in the
skin and metastases in the lung with minimal autoimmune
side effects. Our results in a clinically highly relevant experimental model provide a scientific rationale to evaluate
similar strategies which unleash the power of innate and
adaptive immune defense in future clinical trials. [Cancer Res

Introduction
Powerful new strategies for the antigen-specific immunotherapy
of cancer have been developed in experiments with transplanted
mouse tumor cells. CD8+ T lymphocytes capable of specifically
recognizing and destroying tumor cells in vivo can be effectively
stimulated using a number of different vaccines including synthetic
MHC class I–binding tumor peptides, peptide-pulsed dendritic

cells, recombinant viral vectors, and genetically modified tumor
cells expressing immunostimulatory cytokines (1–4). However,
despite encouraging results in experimental models, each of these
vaccine approaches by itself showed only limited success in clinical
trials (5–11). Subsequent studies in mice using TCR-transgenic
mice and antigen-transfected transplantable tumor cell lines
revealed that self-tolerance (12), ignorance (13), and tumor-induced
immune suppression (14–16) could prevent immune cell–mediated
recognition and destruction of tumors and likely present barriers
for effective cancer immunotherapy in patients.
In order to increase the efficacy of antigen-specific tumor immunotherapy, vaccines have been combined with other treatment
modalities such as immunostimulatory monoclonal antibodies and
toll-like receptor agonists (17–20). An adoptive transfer of tumorspecific T lymphocytes also potently enhances antitumor immunity
(21, 22). The identification of appropriate combination treatment
protocols which can be successfully translated into the clinic has
become one of the major challenges in the field. Experiments with
transplanted mouse tumor cells have only been of limited
predictive value. This is best illustrated by the fact that tumor
vaccines with synthetic peptides and dendritic cells were highly
effective against transplanted tumors in mice (1, 2), but not against
primary tumors in patients (5, 6). Transplanted mouse tumor cell
lines vary greatly in their immunogenicity and interact with the
immune system in a different way when compared with primary
tumors evolving autochthonously in an immunocompetent host.
To overcome the experimental limitations of tumor transplantation, we established the genetically engineered Hgf-Cdk4R24C mouse
model for melanoma, a tumor entity of considerable interest to
tumor immunologists (23). This experimental system imitates the
expected clinical situation because individual Hgf-Cdk4R24C mice
sporadically develop primary cutaneous melanomas due to the
cooperative activity of deregulated receptor tyrosine kinase signaling
and impaired p16-dependent cell cycle arrest, two characteristic
pathogenetic features of human melanoma (23–28). Here, we used
the unique features of the Hgf-Cdk4R24C mouse melanoma model
to develop a highly effective combination chemoimmunotherapy
protocol. The sequential application of four complementary therapeutic approaches, i.e., chemotherapeutic preconditioning prior
to adoptive lymphocyte transfer and viral vaccination followed by
adjuvant peritumoral injections of immunostimulatory nucleic
acids, was able to promote strong cytotoxic inflammation in the
tumor microenvironment associated with complete regression of
advanced primary melanomas in the skin, disappearance of metastases in the lungs, and only minimal autoimmune side effects.

Materials and Methods
Mice and carcinogen treatment. C57BL/6 mice (H-2b) were purchased

previously (20). TCR-transgenic pmel-1 mice (21) were obtained from The
Jackson Laboratory. To enhance melanomagenesis, newborn mice were
painted once at day 4 of life with 40 Ag of 7,12-dimethylbenz(a)anthracene
(DMBA) in 10 AL of acetone. Animal experiments were performed at the
Central Animal Facility of the University Hospital Bonn in adherence to the
standards of German law for the care and use of laboratory animals.
Analysis of primary melanomas. Mice were inspected and photographed weekly. Growing melanocytic tumors >2 mm in diameter were
considered primary melanomas. Their sizes were measured using a vernier
calliper and recorded as mean diameter (in millimeters). Mice were
sacrificed when progressively growing melanomas exceeded 10 mm or
when signs of illness were observed. Autopsy was performed on all mice.
Regional lymph nodes and internal organs were inspected for visible
metastases and tumors harvested.
Tumor transplantation experiments. B16 cells were maintained in
DMEM supplemented with 10% FCS, 2 mmol/L of L-glutamine, 50 Amol/L of
2-mercaptoethanol, 100 IU/mL of penicillin, and 100 Ag/mL of streptomycin
(Invitrogen). Syngeneic C57BL/6 (H-2b) mice were challenged intracutaneously with 105 B16 melanoma cells. The tumor size was calculated
according to the formula, area = (length  width) in mm2. Mice with tumors
>100 mm2 were sacrificed. Experiments were performed in groups of five
mice and repeated at least twice.
Hgf-Cdk4R24C melanomas were serially transplanted by intracutaneous
injections of 2  105 viable tumor cells derived from one transplanted
melanoma. The tumor size was calculated according to the formula,
volume = (length  width2)  0.5 in mm3. Mice with tumors >2,000 mm3
were sacrificed. Experiments were performed with groups of five mice and
repeated twice.
Tumor treatment with adoptively transferred lymphocytes and
recombinant adenovirus. Pmel-1 TCR-transgenic mice recognize the
H-2Db–binding human gp100 (amino acids 25–33) peptide KVPRNQDWL.
Effector T cells cross-react with the mouse gp100 (amino acids 25–33)
peptide EGSRNQDWL (21). Pmel-1 mice expressed Thy1.1 to facilitate T-cell
tracking. For adoptive transfer, lymphocytes were isolated from lymph
nodes and spleens. The number of CD8+Vh13+Thy1.1+ TCR-transgenic
(pmel-1) T cells was determined by flow cytometry. Each treated mouse
received 2  106 pmel-1 T cells i.v. T cells were activated in vivo by one
i.p. injection of 5  108 plaque-forming unit recombinant adenovirus
expressing human gp100. Ad-gp100 was generated as described previously
(29), propagated on 293 cells, purified by cesium chloride density gradient
centrifugation and subsequent dialysis according to standard protocols.
Chemotherapeutic preconditioning and adjuvant innate immune
stimulation. Chemotherapy was performed by injecting mice i.p. with 2 mg
(100 mg/kg) of cyclophosphamide. The synthetic phosphothioate-stabilized
CpG oligodeoxynucleotide 1826 with the sequence 5¶-TCCATGACGTTCCTGACGTT-3¶ (‘‘CpG’’) was purchased from TIB Molbiol. Polyinosinicpolycytidylic acid (‘‘pIC’’) was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Treatment
of mice was performed by injecting 50 Ag of CpG DNA and 50 Ag of pIC
dissolved in 100 AL of PBS peritumorally every 3 to 4 d.
Histopathology, immunohistochemistry, and immunofluorescence.
Tumor samples were immersed in a zinc-based fixative (DAKO), embedded
in paraffin, and stained with H&E. Immunostaining was performed with the
rabbit pAb Pep7 against TRP1 (a kind gift from Vincent Hearing, NIH,
Bethesda, MD) or the rat monoclonal antibodies against CD45 (BD
PharMingen) and CD3 (Serotec) followed by appropriate fluorochromeconjugated or biotin-conjugated secondary antibodies and the LSAB-2 color
development system (DAKO). Heavily pigmented tumors were bleached
before staining (20 min at 37jC in 30% H2O2 and 0.5% KOH, 20 s in 1%
acetic acid, and 5 min in TRIS buffer).
Quantitative reverse transcription-PCR. Tumor samples were immediately snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen. Total RNA was isolated using TRI
Reagent (Sigma) and purified using RNeasy columns (Qiagen). RNA was
reverse-transcribed using Superscript II and oligo-dT18 primers (Invitrogen). PCR was performed with TaqMan assays [Bact Mm00607939_s1, Si
(gp100) Mm00498996_m1, Tgfb1 Mm03024053_m1, Cxcl2 Mm00436450_m1,
and Cxcl10 Mm00445235_m1] or with fast SYBR Green Master Mix (ABI)

Flow cytometry. Tumor tissue, spleens, and lymph nodes were
harvested, dissociated mechanically, incubated with 1 mg/mL of collagenase D (Roche) in PBS with 5% fetal bovine serum (Biochrom) for 30 min at
37jC and filtered through 70-Am cell strainers (BD Biosciences). Staining
was performed with fluorochrome-conjugated antibodies against CD45,
B220, CD8a, CD3, Vh13, CD90, B220, Gr-1, CD11b, CD11c, H2-Kb (all from
BD PharMingen), and IFN-g (eBioscience). For intracellular staining,
Golgistop and Golgiplug (BD Biosciences) were used according to standard
protocols. Data were acquired with a FACSCanto flow or a FACS LSRII flow
cytometry system (FACS Core Facility, Bonn, Germany) and analyzed with
FACSDiva (BD Biosciences) or FlowJo (TreeStar, V8.7.1) software.
Statistical analyses. Statistically significant differences were calculated
with the nonparametric Mann-Whitney U test using the SPSS 11 computer
program.

Results
Primary Hgf-Cdk4R24C melanomas avoid recognition and
destruction by tumor-specific T lymphocytes. We previously
reported that a treatment regimen consisting of recombinant
adenoviral vaccination against the melanosomal protein TRP2 in
combination with adjuvant peritumoral injections of TLR agonists
was only able to delay the growth of primary carcinogen-induced
melanomas in Hgf-Cdk4R24C mice (20). To further enhance cellular
antitumor immunity, we performed adoptive lymphocyte transfer
experiments using TCR-transgenic CD8+ T cells derived from pmel1 mice. Pmel-1 T cells recognize an H2-Db–binding peptide epitope
derived from the human melanosomal protein gp100. Effector
T cells cross-reacts with the slightly different mouse gp100 epitope,
which is naturally expressed by melanocytes and melanoma cells
(21). In our experiments, we took advantage of the early and
synchronous development of primary melanomas in Hgf-Cdk4R24C
mice following epicutaneous application of DMBA shortly after
birth. At an age of 70 days, all DMBA-exposed Hgf-Cdk4R24C mice
carry between 5 and 15 macroscopically visible primary cutaneous
melanomas with the largest tumors measuring between 4 and
6 mm in diameter. Tumor-bearing mice were randomly assigned to
treatment and control cohorts. The treatment cohort received an
adoptive transfer of pmel-1 T lymphocytes and a simultaneous
vaccination with recombinant Ad-gp100 (lymph/vacc, LV). The
treatment was repeated in surviving mice at an age of 91 days. Flow
cytometric analyses of splenocytes and circulating peripheral blood
mononuclear cells in individual LV-treated tumor-bearing mice
confirmed expansion and effector cell differentiation of transferred
pmel-1 T lymphocytes in vivo (Fig. 1A). Despite the presence of
large numbers of circulating tumor-specific effector T lymphocytes
in LV-treated mice, we observed that primary Hgf-Cdk4R24C
melanomas continuously grew similar to untreated control mice
(Fig. 1B).
Next, we investigated how primary tumors avoid recognition and
destruction by tumor-specific T lymphocytes. We sacrificed HgfCdk4R24C mice bearing primary tumors 10 days after the first LV
treatment. Immunofluorescence and flow cytometric analyses of
primary tumors from untreated control mice revealed only very
few infiltrating immune cells. In contrast, tumors from LV-treated
mice showed diffuse infiltration with CD45+ immune cells (Fig. 1C).

Histomorphologic, immunohistochemical, and flow cytometric
analyses of LV-treated tumors showed large numbers of infiltrating
CD3+ T lymphocytes in close contact with melanoma cells, including a significant percentage of CD8+Thy1.1+Vh13+ (pmel-1) effector
cells (Fig. 1D). Thus, primary Hgf-Cdk4R24C melanomas were principally accessible for tumor-specific T lymphocytes but escaped
their cytotoxic effector functions in the tumor microenvironment.

not shown).

strong expression of the melanocyte-specific protein gp100. Shortterm cultures of primary melanoma cells showed both spindleshaped and epithelioid morphologies which recapitulated their
growth pattern in vivo (Fig. 2A). These melanoma cells only
expressed very low levels of MHC class I molecules on their cell
surface which could be up-regulated following exposure to
recombinant IFN-a (Fig. 2B). IFN-g ELISPOT assays showed that
cultured melanoma cells could be recognized by pmel-1 effector
T lymphocytes in vitro as effectively as cultured B16 melanoma
cells. Tumor cell recognition could be significantly improved
following incubation with recombinant IFN-a (Fig. 2C).
Based on our previous experience with adjuvant injections of the
TLR agonists, CpG and pIC (20), we reasoned that the stimulation
of viral pattern recognition receptors which activate the type I IFN
system should promote the antitumor efficacy of adoptively
transferred pmel-1 T lymphocytes (30, 31). We initially evaluated
this hypothesis in parallel experiments using the transplanted B16
melanoma model in a rigorous 10-day treatment model in which
tumors were already macroscopically visible (Fig. 3A). Adoptively
transferred pmel-1 T lymphocytes and viral vaccination with
Ad-gp100 (LV) do not affect the progressive growth of advanced
B16 melanomas in this experimental setting (Fig. 3B). The
antitumor efficacy of adoptive lymphocyte transfer and viral
vaccination could be boosted by persistent stimulation of innate
immunity through adjuvant peritumoral injections of CpG and pIC
(LV + I) leading to considerably prolonged survival (Fig. 3B).
We previously showed that chemotherapeutic preconditioning
with cyclophosphamide enhances the efficacy of melanoma
vaccines (18). Cyclophosphamide also facilitates the expansion of
adoptively transferred T lymphocytes (32, 33). Strikingly, a
treatment protocol consisting of cyclophosphamide treatment
before adoptive lymphocyte transfer and viral vaccination followed
by adjuvant injections of CpG and pIC (C + LV + I) achieved
complete regression of large B16 melanomas (Fig. 3B). This com-

bination treatment protocol was much less effective without innate
immune stimulation (C + LV) or without adoptive lymphocyte
transfer (C + V + I), indicating that all four components were
required (Fig. 3B). Mice in the C + LV + I–treated groups remained
tumor-free for several months and showed only limited destruction
of melanocytes indicating preferential recognition and destruction
of malignant over normal melanocytic cells (data not shown).
In subsequent experiments, we treated established transplanted
Hgf-Cdk4R24C melanomas generated by serial transplantation of
primary tumors (Fig. 3C). Groups of mice with macroscopically
visible transplanted Hgf-Cdk4R24C melanomas received an adoptive
transfer of pmel-1 T lymphocytes and recombinant adenoviral
vaccination (LV) on day 14 or were left untreated. Established
transplanted Hgf-Cdk4R24C melanomas were not affected by the
LV treatment similar to advanced transplanted B16 melanomas
(Fig. 3D). However, treatment according to the C + LV + I protocol
also resulted in complete regression and long-term cure, demonstrating unequivocally that pmel-1 T cells are able to recognize and
destroy Hgf-Cdk4R24C melanoma cells (Fig. 3D).
Complete regression of primary cutaneous as well as
metastatic Hgf-Cdk4R24C melanomas. Having shown the efficacy
of our combination chemoimmunotherapy protocol against transplanted Hgf-Cdk4R24C melanoma, we also treated mice with
primary Hgf-Cdk4R24C melanomas. DMBA-exposed Hgf-Cdk4R24C
mice were again randomly assigned to different cohorts at an age
of 70 days at which time they carried multiple, macroscopically
visible primary melanomas. Strikingly, two consecutive C + LV + I
treatment cycles were able to cause the complete regression
of primary cutaneous melanomas (Fig. 4A and B). In a total of
30 mice treated in 8 independent experiments, we observed significantly prolonged survival (Fig. 4C). Control cohorts of tumorbearing mice received either cyclophosphamide and CpG/pIC
(C + I) or adoptive lymphocytes and viral vaccination (LV) only,
both of which slightly delayed tumor progression (Fig. 4C).

Next, we determined the effect of the C + LV + I treatment
protocol on metastatic disease. DMBA-exposed Hgf-Cdk4R24C mice
already carried spontaneous lung metastases at an age of 70 days
when treatment was started (Fig. 4D). In a cohort of five C + LV + I–
treated mice which showed complete regression of their DMBAinduced primary melanomas in the skin at an age of 135 days, we
did not find any metastases in the lungs. In contrast, lung metastases were found in almost all LV-treated and untreated mice at the
time of death (Fig. 4D). Thus, our combination chemoimmunotherapy not only caused the regression of primary cutaneous melanomas but also of spontaneous metastases in the lungs.
Cytotoxic inflammation in the tumor microenvironment.
Next, we investigated the effect of chemotherapeutic preconditioning and adjuvant innate immune stimulation on the number
and functional status of adoptively transferred pmel-1 T cells in
tumor-bearing mice. Cyclophosphamide treatment before adoptive
lymphocyte transfer and viral vaccination (C + LV) enhanced
the expansion of adoptively transferred pmel-1 T lymphocytes
(Fig. 5A). Additional adjuvant peritumoral injections of CpG/
pIC after adoptive lymphocyte transfer and viral vaccination (C +
LV + I) promoted their survival and supported their effector cell
differentiation as evidenced by an increase in the percentage of
lymphocytes capable of producing IFN-g (Fig. 5A). Experiments

with groups of mice bearing transplanted B16 melanoma analyzed
at different time points confirmed that chemotherapy and innate
immune stimulation cooperatively increased expansion, survival,
and effector differentiation of adoptively transferred pmel-1
T lymphocytes in vivo (*, P < 0.05; Fig. 5B).
The combined activities of the C + LV + I protocol converge in
the microenvironment of primary tumors. Quantitative RT-PCR
analyses 10 days after adoptive lymphocyte transfer in C + LV + I–
treated mice showed significantly increased expression of mRNA
coding for IFN-g, CXCL-10, perforin, and granzyme B (*, P < 0.05;
Fig. 5C) when compared with LV-treated mice. This correlated
with enhanced immune cell infiltration in C + LV + I–treated mice
(data not shown). Increased expression of the transcription factor
T-bet characteristic for a Th1-biased cytotoxic immune response
and decreased expression of the transcription factor Foxp3 characteristic for regulatory T cells was observed in both LV-treated and
C + LV + I–treated tumors. Histopathologic and immunofluorescence analyses revealed massive tumor cell destruction associated with dense infiltration of CD3+ T cells (Fig. 5D). Collectively,
these results show that the C + LV + I treatment strongly promotes
cytotoxic inflammation in primary melanomas.

of C + LV + I–treated mice which showed complete tumor regression for longer time periods. Starting at an age of 150 days, f2 months
after the second C + LV + I treatment cycle, these mice developed new
pigmented melanomas in their carcinogen-treated skin (Fig. 6A).
These new primary melanomas in successfully C + LV + I–treated
mice at an age of 200 days histomorphologically resembled those
observed in untreated mice at an age of 90 days with very little
immune cell infiltrate. Quantitative RT-PCR analyses of tumors
revealed increased expression of transforming growth factor-h and
CXCL-2 relative to IFN-g and CXCL-10, as well as decreased
expression of perforin, granzyme B, and T-bet (Fig. 6B). Interestingly,
we did not observe an increase in the expression of Foxp3 or an
increase in CD4+CD25+ T cells in these tumors which would indicate

Cancer Res 2009; 69: (15). August 1, 2009

the local activity of regulatory T cells (Fig. 6B and C). Again, most
immune cells within tumors showed a Gr1+CD11b+ phenotype which
corresponded to enhanced infiltration with granulocytes, frequently
in association with superficial ulceration (Fig. 6C; data not shown).
Importantly, we were able to detect a small but significant
population of CD8+Thy1.1+Vh13+ (pmel-1) T cells not only in the
spleens but also in the new pigmented cutaneous melanomas in all
investigated mice at an average age of 200 days, i.e., 3 months after
the second treatment cycle. These pmel-1 T cells could be
expanded to large numbers following a booster vaccination with
recombinant Ad-gp100 (Fig. 6D). Thus, adoptively transferred
pmel-1 T cells in C + LV + I–treated mice acquire memory status,
persist for an extended time, and can be efficiently restimulated

in vivo. Future experiments will have to reveal whether these
reactivated T cells are again capable of causing tumor regression.

Discussion
In our work, we identified a highly effective combination
chemoimmunotherapy which can reverse immune tolerance in
the tumor microenvironment and cause complete regression of
advanced primary and metastatic melanomas in a novel genetically
engineered tumor model. This model avoids the use of immunogenic foreign proteins as oncogenes or antigens (i.e. SV40 large

T antigen or Her-2/neu; refs. 34–41). Instead, tumors arise
autochthonously in the skin, grow progressively, and metastasize
spontaneously to draining lymph nodes and lungs because of two
nonimmunogenic genetic changes also observed in patients.
Although tumor cells express several melanocyte-specific lineage
differentiation antigens which can be potentially recognized by

continued to grow even in the presence of large numbers of in vivo–

immune tolerance, we combined adoptive lymphocyte transfer
and viral vaccination with adjuvant peritumoral injections of the
immunostimulatory nucleic acids, CpG and pIC, which activate
viral pattern recognition receptors of the toll receptor family (23,
30, 42). Persistent innate immune stimulation strongly enhanced
the therapeutic efficacy of adoptive lymphocyte transfer and adenoviral
vaccination. Chemotherapeutic preconditioning with cyclophosphamide, which has facilitated tumor treatment with adoptively transferred
lymphocytes for many years (43), further increased antitumor efficacy
leading to complete and long-term regression of advanced, macroscopically visible transplanted as well as primary melanomas. All four
complementary components of our treatment protocol were required
to achieve complete regression and long-term remission of large primary and transplanted melanomas.
Cyclophosphamide pretreatment and adjuvant injections of
immunostimulatory nucleic acids cooperatively enhanced both

the expansion as well as the cytotoxic effector cell differentiation of adoptively transferred pmel-1 T lymphocytes and
induced a strong cytotoxic inflammation in the tumor microenvironment. Cyclophosphamide has pleiotropic effects including the promotion of T-cell homeostatic expansion, inhibition of regulatory T-cell function, damage to the tumor vasculature, and functional alteration of tumor-infiltrating immune
cells (32, 33, 44). CpG and pIC activate the type I IFN system
through viral pattern recognition receptors (31). IFNs may be
involved in resurrecting the barriers to cancer development on
several levels. We show that IFN-a increases MHC class I expression on Hgf-Cdk4R24C melanoma cells and supports recognition by pmel-1 T cells. In addition, IFNs can also promote tumor
cell apoptosis, impair angiogenesis, counteract immunosuppression, prolong T-cell survival, and enhance cytotoxic effector functions in the tumor microenvironment (45–48).

Cure of Advanced Primary Melanoma

Of the potential mechanisms for tumor immune tolerance in primary Hgf-Cdk4R24C melanomas, we could rule out the local activity
of regulatory T cells or tumor-associated macrophages as these
cells were rarely found within primary tumors. Instead, myeloidderived suppressor cells may be involved because the majority of
tumor-infiltrating immune cells show a Gr1+CD11b+ phenotype. In
addition, we speculate that the well-known immunosuppressive
activity of hepatocyte growth factor and the distinct immunologic
properties of melanocytes might participate in inhibiting T-cell
effector functions in the tumor microenvironment.
All successfully C + LV + I–treated mice with complete tumor
regression eventually developed new primary DMBA-induced
melanomas which morphologically resembled those observed in
untreated mice. A detailed molecular and cellular analysis of the
tumor microenvironment indicated that the balance of cytokines
and chemokines had shifted back in favor of tumor progression.
Tumor growth occurred despite the presence of melanoma-specific
(pmel-1) memory T cells, which could be found both in secondary
lymphoid organs as well as in the tumor itself. These potentially
tumor-specific T cells could be efficiently reactivated in vivo with a
recombinant adenovirus booster immunization. The newly arising
primary melanomas apparently evaded the surveillance function by
pmel-1 memory T cells, presumably because they do not adequately
activate the innate immune system. The effect of the vaccineinduced T-cell memory response on tumor growth will have to be
determined in future experiments.
Interestingly, treated mice with complete tumor regression
showed only limited vitiligo-like fur depigmentation predominantly
at the site of tumors, although pmel-1 T cells can principally
recognize and kill all cells of melanocytic origin which express
the melanosomal protein gp100. This suggests that our combination chemoimmunotherapy promotes preferential recognition
and destruction of malignant over normal pigment cells. The

relative tumor selectivity may be conferred by combining the
antigen-specificity of T cells with the nonspecific action of chemotherapy and innate immune stimulation on both immune and
tumor cells. This may be an advantage over the use of high-dose
interleukin 2, which promotes the antitumor efficacy of adoptively
transferred lymphocytes with significant autoreactivity against
pigment cells (49).
Treatment protocols combining chemotherapy, total body
irradiation, adoptive lymphocyte transfer and vaccination strategies are currently evaluated in a large number of clinical trials. Our
results suggest that adjuvant innate immune stimulation using
immunostimulatory nucleic acids can also be a powerful approach
to enhance the therapeutic efficacy of adoptive lymphocyte transfer
and viral vaccination. The use of TLR agonists may even replace
total body irradiation because it has recently been reported that
this treatment modality depends on TLR triggering (50). The
unique experimental features of the genetically engineered HgfCdk4R24C mouse model, which faithfully portrays the biology of
melanoma in man, may help to facilitate the successful clinical
translation of effective strategies for combination chemoimmunotherapy against this deadly disease.
