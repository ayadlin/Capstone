Abstract
Mutational activation of the K-Ras oncogene is well established as a key genetic step in the development and growth of
pancreatic adenocarcinomas. However, the mechanism by
which aberrant Ras signaling promotes uncontrolled pancreatic tumor cell growth remains to be fully elucidated. The
recent use of primary human cells to study Ras-mediated
oncogenesis provides important model cell systems to dissect
this mechanism. We have used a model of telomeraseimmortalized human pancreatic duct-derived cells (E6/E7/st)
to study mechanisms of Ras growth transformation. First,
we found that human papillomavirus E6 and E7 oncogenes,
which block the function of the p53 and Rb tumor
suppressors, respectively, and SV40 small t antigen were
required to allow mutant K-Ras(12D) growth transformation. Second, K-Ras(12D) caused growth transformation
in vitro, including enhanced growth rate and loss of density
dependency for growth, anchorage independence, and invasion through reconstituted basement membrane proteins,
and tumorigenic transformation in vivo. Third, we determined that the Raf, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K),
and Ral guanine nucleotide exchange factor effector pathways
were activated, although extracellular signal-regulated kinase
(ERK) activity was not up-regulated persistently. Finally,
pharmacologic inhibition of Raf/mitogen-activated protein
kinase/ERK and PI3K signaling impaired K-Ras–induced
anchorage-independent growth and invasion. In summary,
our studies established, characterized, and validated E6/E7/st
cells for the study of Ras-induced oncogenesis. [Cancer Res

Introduction
The majority of pancreatic cancers arise from cells of ductal
origin, and one of the earliest genetic events in the progression of
these normal ductal epithelia to premalignant pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia is mutation of the K-Ras oncogene (1).
Mutational activation of Ras proteins is seen with high frequency
(90%) in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas (2). Hence, there has

been considerable interest in the development of Ras inhibitors for
pancreatic cancer treatment (3). However, despite our knowledge
of Ras regulation and signaling (4), exploiting that information for
defining effective approaches for blocking aberrant Ras function has
not been accomplished. This task has been complicated by the
realization that the mechanisms of Ras signaling important for
oncogenesis exhibit significant cell context differences and
therefore may be variable for different cancer types (5). Thus, there
remains a strong need for delineating the mechanisms by which
mutated Ras promotes and maintains pancreatic cancer growth.
K-Ras functions as a binary switch that cycles between an active
GTP-bound and inactive GDP-bound state, with active Ras binding
and activating a functionally diverse spectrum of downstream
effector proteins (4). K-Ras is mutated in pancreatic cancers,
leading to persistent effector activation. The best-characterized
effector pathway in Ras function is the Raf/mitogen-activated
protein kinase (MEK)/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)
cascade. However, B-Raf mutations are not commonly seen in
pancreatic cancers (6), and surprisingly, up-regulated ERK
activation was not seen in most pancreatic cancer cell lines or
patient tumors (7–9). Therefore, it is likely that other effector
pathways may also serve critical roles in Ras-mediated promotion
of pancreatic cancer growth.
Currently, four additional Ras effector families have been
implicated in Ras-mediated oncogenesis (4). Of these, the
phosphatidylinositol 3-kinases (PI3K), which activate the Akt
serine/threonine kinases, and the Ral small GTPase guanine
nucleotide exchange factors (RalGEF) have received the most
attention (4). Two other effector pathways (Tiam1 and phospholipase Cq) have also been implicated in Ras-mediated oncogenesis
(4), but their roles in pancreatic cancer growth have not been
determined. Finally, additional effectors are likely to contribute to
Ras-mediated oncogenesis. Therefore, to facilitate ongoing efforts
to target Ras signaling for pancreatic cancer treatment, a more
definitive determination of the role of specific effector pathways in
pancreatic cancer growth is needed.
Recent advances have established new experimental systems to
study pancreatic cancer and include the development of K-Ras–
driven mouse models for pancreatic cancer (10–13). Although such
models will surely provide powerful approaches for the dissection
of Ras-mediated oncogenesis, whether mouse models accurately
recapitulate human cancers remains to be fully validated (14).
Therefore, cell culture models remain an important complement to
mouse models. The advent of RNA interference (RNAi) has allowed
the further development of human tumor cell culture models to
study the mechanism of oncogenic Ras, and silencing of mutant
K-Ras function in pancreatic carcinoma cell lines has provided

Ras Transformation of Human Pancreatic Cells

further validation for the importance of continuous Ras function
for tumor cell maintenance (15, 16). However, an obvious limitation
of this approach is that established pancreatic carcinoma cell lines
harbor many unknown genetic lesions, including some that may
have been acquired during their long passage history in cell culture.
Another important breakthrough in the investigation of cancer
progression uses human primary cells to study the role of Ras in
malignant transformation (17). Weinberg et al. and others used
ectopic expression of the catalytic subunit of telomerase (hTERT)
and viral antigen inactivation of p53 and Rb tumor suppression
function to create unique in vitro systems for the study of cancer
(18–20). These genetically defined immortalized human cells are
sensitive to growth transformation by ectopic expression of
oncogenic forms of Ras. The well-defined nature of these cell
systems allows for the dissection of mechanisms of oncogenesis
caused by specific and discrete genetic events.
To date, several pancreatic cell systems have been described to
study Ras oncogenesis (21–26). Although Lohr et al. (22) generated
immortalized cells expressing SV40 large T antigen and mutant
K-Ras that formed contact-independent colonies in vitro and
orthotopic tumors in mice, these were of bovine and not human
origin. Tsao et al. (26) investigated human pancreatic ductal
epithelial (HPDE) cells immortalized with human papillomavirus
(HPV) 16 E6 and E7 oncogenes to inactivate p53 and Rb, respectively,
and further transformed these cells with mutant K-Ras. The
K-Ras–transformed HPDE cells formed tumors in nude mice but,
interestingly, showed no indication of in vitro transformation as
indicated by proliferation or contact-independent growth. Hence,
they concluded that additional genetic alterations were required for
full malignant growth transformation of HPDE cells. Therefore,
the need for well-defined genetic human cell culture models for
the study of Ras-mediated pancreatic cancer development remains.
The goal of our studies was to develop a novel human cell system
to study the mechanisms of K-Ras–mediated pancreatic cancer
development. Here, we report on the biological and signaling
consequences of K-Ras activation on an immortalized cell line
derived from pancreatic duct epithelia (E6/E7/st). Previous reports
indicate that pancreatic adenocarcinoma may in some cases arise
from acinar-to-ductal metaplasia (27–29) via a precursor intermediary. Our immortalized duct-derived cell line seems to represent a
population of this precursor (30). Similar to other human cell types,
ectopic hTERT expression and suppression of p53 and Rb function
were not sufficient to render these human pancreatic cells sensitive
to transformation by oncogenic K-Ras. Instead, the additional
introduction of SV40 small t (st) antigen was required for Rasmediated growth transformation. Ectopic expression of mutant
K-Ras at physiologic levels promoted anchorage-independent
growth and invasion in vitro and tumorigenic growth in vivo.
Sustained activation of MEK (but not ERK), Akt, and RalA was
associated with Ras transformation, and inhibitors of both the
Raf-MEK-ERK and PI3K effector pathways blocked the growth of
Ras-transformed E6/E7/st cells. These results establish E6/E7/st
cells as an important model cell system to delineate the signaling
mechanisms for Ras-mediated oncogenesis and growth of pancreatic ductal epithelial cells.

Materials and Methods
Cell line generation and characterization. Pancreatic duct-derived
cells were immortalized as described previously (23). Briefly, primary cell
cultures isolated from pancreatic ducts were sequentially infected with

www.aacrjournals.org

retroviral vectors to express human telomerase (hTERT) and the E6 and E7
proteins of HPV16 (Fig. 1). From this precursor cell line, a matched pair was
generated with or without expression of the constitutively activated K-Ras
(G12D) mutant (designated E6/E7 and E6/E7/Ras, respectively). Finally,
these two cell lines were infected with retrovirus to express viral SV40 st
antigen (designated E6/E7/st and E6/E7/Ras/st, respectively). The resulting
mass populations were maintained at 5% CO2 in M3:5 growth medium [4
parts high-glucose DMEM (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA) to 1 part M3F
(INCELL, San Antonio, TX) supplemented with 5% FCS].
To verify expression of ectopically introduced cDNA sequences, total RNA
was extracted from cells using standard Trizol (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA)
protocols and reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) was done using the
following sequences: K-Ras, 5¶-CTTGCTGAATTCCTGCTGAAAATGACTGAATATA-3¶ and 5¶-GCTACTCGAGGTATGCCTTAAGAAAAAAGTACAA-3¶;
h-actin, 5¶-CGGGACCTGACTGACTACCT-3¶ and 5¶-CAGCACTGTGTTGGCGTACA-3¶; E6, 5¶-GAACAGCAATACAACAAACCG-3¶ and 5¶-GCAACAAGACATACATCGACC-3¶; E7, 5¶-AGGAGGAGGATGAAATAGATGG-3¶
and 5¶-TGGTTTCTGAGAACAGATGGG-3¶; and SV40 st, 5¶-GAAGCAGTAGCAATCAACCC-3¶ and 5¶-GCTTCTTCCTTAAATCCTGGTG-3¶. PCR products
of K-Ras cDNA were digested with BccI to determine samples expressing
wild-type and mutant K-Ras. Visualization of K-Ras protein expression and
activation was done by pull-down assay using the glutathione S-transferase
(GST)-bound Raf-Ras-binding domain as described previously (31),
with expression of h-actin as a loading control (AC-15; Sigma-Aldrich,
St. Louis, MO).
Growth transformation assays. For analysis of anchorage-independent
growth, log-phase growing cells were trypsinized, and triplicates of 3  103
cells per well were suspended in enriched medium (supplemented with 10%
FCS) supplemented with 1.5% agar and plated onto the agar-coated six-well
plates. Standard medium (1 mL) was added to the top of the gelled matrix,
and colonies were grown for 21 days. Stock solution of inhibitors was
dissolved in DMSO (vehicle) and added to both the agar containing the
cells and the feeding medium at the following final concentrations:
MCP110/MCP122 (32), BAY 43-9006 (33), and LY294002 (Promega, Madison,
WI) at 10 Amol/L or U0126 (Promega) at 30 Amol/L. After 21 days in
culture, colonies were counted in five random three-dimensional fields per
well and photographed.
For tumorigenicity analysis, cells were injected into the flanks of
Hsd:Athymic Nude-Foxn1nu nude mice (Harlan, Indianapolis, IN) at seeding
densities of 0.2, 0.5, 1, or 2  106 cells per site. Tumor measurements were
taken by calipers thrice weekly over 8 weeks or until tumor burden reached 1
cm3. Tumor volumes were calculated by estimation of an ellipsoid using (4/
3)k(x/2)(y/2)(z/2), where x is length, y is width, and z is depth of the tumor.
Signaling protein expression and activation. Cells growing in log
phase were incubated for 24 h in starvation medium (normal medium
lacking serum but with 1 g/mL bovine serum albumin and 10 mmol/L
HEPES) before adding inhibitors for an additional 24 h. Western blot
analyses were done using primary antibodies against ERK1 and ERK2 (Cell
Signaling), phosphorylated ERK1/2 (Cell Signaling, Danvers, MA), phosphorylated MEK1 and MEK2 (Cell Signaling), MAPK phosphatase-2 (MKP-2;
Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), Akt (Cell Signaling), and
phosphorylated Akt (Cell Signaling). Pull-down assays to detect formation of
active GTP-bound RalA were done as described previously (34).
Migration assays. Cells grown to 90% confluence were starved as above
for 24 h. At t = 0, cells were treated with inhibitors of the Raf-MEK-ERK or
PI3K-Akt pathways as described above, and a wound was created by
scratching the monolayer of cells with a pipette tip (35). At 12 h, cells were
fixed and stained with Diff-Quik (Dade Behring, Newark, DE) and
micrographs were taken with a 40 objective.
For transwell migration assays, pancreatic-derived cells were starved
and treated with inhibitors as above for 24 h. Cells were suspended from
adherent cultures with 1 mL TrypLE trypsin-free dissociation solution
(Invitrogen) and counted. Twenty thousand cells were loaded into 500 AL of
starvation medium and inhibitors in the top well of BioCoat chambers that
contain growth factor reduced Matrigel extracellular basement membrane
over a polyethylene terephthalate membrane with 8 Am pores (BD
Biosciences, Bedford, MA). The bottom chamber contained the same

in immortalized human pancreatic
duct-derived cells. A, scheme for
immortalization and Ras transformation of
human pancreatic duct cells. As described
previously (23), ectopic expression of
hTERT was used to immortalize a primary
pancreatic duct cell culture to generate
hTERT-HPNE cells. These cells were then
sequentially infected with retroviral
constructs to express first the HPV
proteins E6 and E7 (E6/E7 ) and then
constitutively active K-Ras(12D). The
resultant stably selected E6/E7 and E6/E7/

encoding SV40 st to establish E6/E7/st
and E6/E7/Ras/st cells, respectively.

cells were established that stably

stably expressing SV40 st. The resulting
mass populations of cells were then

was used as a control for equivalent
mRNA. D, verification of the presence of
the mutant K-Ras gene and expression in

from mutant K-Ras(12D) (mut). Pull-down
analyses and Western blot analyses with

medium and inhibitor concentration. Cells were allowed to invade for
24 h before the Matrigel was removed, and invaded cells were fixed and
stained with Diff-Quik. Cells adhering to the bottom surface of the membrane were counted under microscopy.

Results
Human pancreatic duct-derived cell immortalization. From
previously established immortalized human pancreatic ductderived cells (23), we then stably introduced constitutively active
K-Ras(12D) into the E6/E7 cells (designated E6/E7/Ras) to create a
matched pair of cells (Fig. 1A). However, our analyses of the E6/E7/
Ras cohort found that these cells retained anchorage dependence
for growth and did not form colonies when suspended in soft agar
(Fig. 1B). Therefore, because studies with other human cell types
identified the requirement for SV40 st antigen function to facilitate
Ras transformation (19, 36, 37), we also established E6/E7 and E6/
E7/Ras cells stably expressing SV40 st, designated E6/E7/st and E6/
E7/Ras/st, respectively. We first did RT-PCR analyses to verify the

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (5). March 1, 2007

expression of each of the introduced genes in the matched cells
(Fig. 1C). To distinguish wild-type K-Ras (G12; wt) from mutant
K-Ras (G12D; mut), we PCR amplified DNA from the pair of cells
and then digested the K-Ras fragments with BccI. Although both cell
lines express wild-type endogenous K-Ras (Fig. 1D), only the E6/E7/
Ras/st cells expressed the mutant K-Ras(12D) transcript. Western
blot analyses showed that wild-type and mutant K-Ras cells
expressed similar levels of total K-Ras protein (Fig. 1D). However,
pull-down analyses illustrated that constitutive K-Ras-GTP activation was seen only in E6/E7/Ras/st cells. This result contrasts with
other human model cell systems described, where the ectopically
introduced Ras gene resulted in significant protein expression at
levels higher than is typically seen in human tumor cells. Thus, the
matched pair of E6/E7/st and E6/E7/Ras/st cells provided us with a
well-defined genetic model system to assess the biochemical and
biological repercussions of mutant K-Ras when expressed at
physiologic levels and without the potential confounding influences
of other unknown genetic changes inherent in tumor cell lines.

Ras Transformation of Human Pancreatic Cells

Expression of oncogenic K-Ras leads to aberrant growth but
not morphology. We next evaluated the growth properties of E6/
E7/st and E6/E7/Ras/st cells to determine the consequences of Ras
activation. Initially, we seeded the E6/E7/st and E6/E7/Ras/st cells
onto plastic to observe differences in morphology and growth
characteristics. At subconfluent densities, whereas cells expressing
mutant K-Ras(12D) showed a similar morphology to their wild-type
matched pair (Fig. 2A), oncogenic K-Ras(12D) expression caused a
loss of density-dependent inhibition of growth at confluent
densities (Fig. 2A, superconfluence). Whereas E6/E7/st cells formed
a confluent cobblestone monolayer reminiscent of other epithelial
cells, E6/E7/Ras/st cells continued to divide, forming multilayered
cultures. Consistent with this observation, we observed that E6/E7/
Ras/st cells showed both increased rate of growth and higher
saturation densities when compared to E6/E7/st cells (Fig. 2B). Our
results differ with a recent study that found that activated K-Ras
did not alter the anchorage-dependent growth properties of
immortalized pancreatic ductal epithelial cells (26).
In addition to differences in adherent cell proliferation, we also
investigated the role of oncogenic Ras expression on anchorageindependent growth. Whereas E6/E7/st cells did not form colonies
in soft agar, E6/E7/Ras/st cells showed spherical colony formation
within 1 week of seeding and robust proliferating colonies that
were visible to the naked eye within 2 weeks (Fig. 2C). Similarly,
E6/E7 cells expressing activated H-Ras(12V) or N-Ras(12D),
together with SV40 st, also formed colonies in soft agar, indicating
that all Ras isoforms could cause growth transformation (Fig. 1B).
Our observations are in contrast with another study that found that
activated K-Ras did not promote the anchorage-independent
growth of immortalized pancreatic ductal epithelial cells (26).
Finally, we determined if mutant K-Ras expression could alter
the tumorigenicity of E6/E7/st cells when introduced s.c. into nude
mice. Whereas E6/E7/st cells did not exhibit any tumor growth
when monitored for up to 54 days, E6/E7/Ras/st cells resulted in

palpable tumors within 1 week, and progressive tumor growth was
seen in all of the injected mice (Fig. 2D). Taken together with our
in vitro analyses, we conclude that constitutively active K-Ras
causes multiple changes in growth characteristics similar to those
attributed to mutant K-Ras in human pancreatic carcinoma cell
lines.
Oncogenic K-Ras(12D) activates multiple downstream
effector pathways. Although the Raf-MEK-ERK cascade is the
best-characterized effector pathway involved in Ras transformation
(4), previous studies found that ERK activity is not consistently
elevated in pancreatic carcinoma cell lines and that other effector
pathways may be important for Ras transformation (38). Therefore,
we next investigated whether three key effector pathways
important for Ras transformation are activated in E6/E7/Ras/st
cells.
We first determined if the Raf-MEK-ERK pathway is persistently
activated in E6/E7/Ras/st cells. Surprisingly, E6/E7/Ras/st and E6/
E7/st cells showed comparable low levels of phosphorylated,
activated ERK1/2. This contrasts with observations made in the
majority of cell models of Ras transformation, where ectopic
expression of mutant Ras causes persistent ERK activation (39, 40).
However, these data are similar to those reported for pancreatic
carcinoma cell lines, where elevated MEK, but not ERK, was seen
(9). We also found a significant increase in the phosphorylated
forms of MEK1 and MEK2. It has been reported previously that a
lack of ERK activation seen in pancreatic adenocarcinoma cell lines
was due to a concomitant increase in MEK-dependent MKP-2
activity (38). We too observed a modest increase in MKP-2
expression in E6/E7/Ras/st cells, which may contribute to the lack
of ERK activation seen in these cells (Fig. 3).
We next determined the activation of two other Ras effector
pathways. Compared with E6/E7/st cells, the mutant Ras-expressing counterparts showed elevated phosphorylated Akt levels
(Fig. 3). We used a pull-down assay with a GST fusion protein

54 d.

Figure 3. Ras activation of effector signaling pathways in
E6/E7/st cells. Serum-starved whole-cell lysates were
separated by SDS-PAGE, and Western blot analyses for the
phosphorylated and activated forms of ERK1 and ERK2, MEK1
and MEK2, and Akt were done. Pull-down analysis was done to
determine the level of activated RalA-GTP. Blot analyses
were also done to determine total MEK1/2, ERK1/2, Akt, RalA,
and MKP-2 protein expression, with blot analyses for h-actin to

carrying the Ral-GTP-binding domain of the Rlf RalGEF to quantify
the levels of activated RalA-GTP and found that E6/E7/Ras/st cells
showed greater activation of RalA when compared with E6/E7/st
cells (Fig. 3). Thus, at least two additional Ras effector pathways
known to promote Ras transformation are persistently activated in
E6/E7/Ras/st cells.
Raf-MEK and PI3K activation promotes Ras growth transformation of E6/E7/st cells. We next used pharmacologic
approaches to determine the contribution of specific effector
pathways to Ras transformation of E6/E7/st cells. First, we used
inhibitors that target different components of the Raf-MEK-ERK
pathway. MCP110 is an inhibitor of Ras interaction with Raf and
has been shown to block Ras transformation of NIH 3T3 cells (32).
The compound MCP122 is a weak Ras-Raf interaction inhibitor and
served as a negative control for MCP110. BAY 43-9006 (sorafenib)
was developed originally as an inhibitor of Raf kinases, although it
also has inhibitory activity for other protein kinases involved in
tumor angiogenesis (33). U0126 is a highly specific inhibitor of
MEK1- and MEK2-dependent activation of ERK. Second, we also
used LY294002 to block PI3K activity.
E6/E7/Ras/st cells were seeded in soft agar with growth medium
supplemented with vehicle (DMSO) or each inhibitor. Anchorageindependent colony formation was inhibited significantly by
treatment with MCP110 but not by MCP122 (Fig. 4A and B). A
similar level of reduction was seen with U0126 treatment, whereas
complete inhibition of colony formation was seen in BAY 43-9006–
treated cells. Thus, although the steady-state level of ERK activity
was not elevated in E6/E7/Ras/st cells, these results indicate that
the Raf-MEK pathway contributes to Ras-mediated anchorageindependent growth. Finally, LY294002 treatment also significantly
reduced soft agar colony formation, indicating that the PI3K-Akt
pathway also contributes to Ras-mediated anchorage-independent
growth.
Oncogenic K-Ras stimulates migration, which is blunted by
Raf pathway and PI3K inhibitors. Because Ras activation has
been shown to promote altered cell motility and increased invasion
in other cell systems, we wanted to use our model system to
investigate whether oncogenic K-Ras causes an increase in
pancreatic duct-derived cell motility. To assess migration, we did

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (5). March 1, 2007

a scratch wound-healing assay for E6/E7/st and E6/E7/Ras/st cells,
where a wound was created on 70% to 90% confluent monolayers
of serum-starved cells to stimulate migration. We then treated the
cells with the same inhibitors used in the contact-independent
growth assay. We lysed parallel plates of cells to observe signaling
protein activation for the Raf-MEK-ERK and PI3K-Akt pathways
by Western blotting. For both E6/E7/st and E6/E7/Ras/st cells,
migration from the border of the wound into the void occurred
rapidly over 12 h. Whereas the negative control MCP122-treated
cells showed similar rates of migration compared with DMSOtreated cells, cells treated with BAY 43-9006, MCP110, U0126, and
LY294002 were slowed in their ability to migrate (Fig. 5A and B). All
inhibitor treatments decreased motility of both cell types by 45% to
70%. That almost complete phosphorylated ERK inhibition by
U0126 did not change motility significantly from BAY 43-9006–
treated E6/E7/Ras/st cells (Fig. 5C) indicates that, although the
increased activity of the Raf-MEK cascade promotes the migration
of these cells, ERK phosphorylation is not required.
Oncogenic K-Ras(12D) induces an invasive phenotype. We
next investigated whether constitutively active K-Ras stimulated
the invasive properties of the E6/E7/st cells. For these analyses, we
compared the ability of E6/E7/st and E6/E7/Ras/st cells to invade
through Matrigel. In the absence of growth factor stimulation, E6/
E7/st cells did not invade through Matrigel, whereas E6/E7/Ras/st
cells migrated readily (Fig. 6A and B). Treatment with inhibitors of
the Raf-MEK-ERK pathway as well as PI3K all decreased the
invasive ability of E6/E7/Ras/st cells, with BAY 43-9006 causing
a complete block. Thus, the activities of both the Raf and the
PI3K effectors are involved in Ras promotion of E6/E7/st invasion
in vitro.

Discussion
The frequent mutational activation of K-Ras in pancreatic
cancers, when coupled with experimental mouse and cell culture
studies that show a critical role for Ras in pancreatic tumor
maintenance, provides strong validation for Ras as an important
target for novel therapies for pancreatic cancer (1). Complicating
the development of such therapies is the lack of a clear delineation

of the effector signaling mechanisms by which Ras drives the
transformation of pancreatic cancer cells. In addition to the RafMEK-ERK cascade, at least four other effector pathways have been
implicated in the oncogenic functions of Ras (4). Furthermore, it is
evident that cell context differences are seen with mechanisms of
Ras-mediated oncogenesis (5) and that observations made with the
classic rodent fibroblast models may not accurately predict what
Ras does in human epithelial tumor cells. In this study, we have
established and characterized a model cell system to study Rasmediated oncogenesis in pancreatic ductal cells. We showed that
ectopic expression of hTERT can immortalize pancreatic ductderived cells and although disruption of p53 and Rb tumor
suppressor function did not result in transformation of these
immortal cells, additional expression of the SV40 st antigen was
required for rendering primary pancreatic cells sensitive to Rasmediated transformation. We also showed that despite a lack of
elevated ERK activation in Ras-transformed E6/E7/st cells,
various inhibitors of the Raf-MEK-ERK MAPK cascade are
nevertheless effective in blocking the aberrant growth of Rastransformed E6/E7/st cells. Thus, we have validated E6/E7/st

cells as an important model cell system to evaluate Ras-mediated
oncogenesis.
Similar to other primary human cell types, we found that ectopic
expression of SV40 st was required to facilitate Ras growth
transformation in vitro (17). This need of st for Ras transformation
in a variety of human cell types argues that st function defines a
critical and general step in Ras-mediated oncogenesis. One
mechanism by which st may contribute to transformation involves
its interaction with and inactivation of the serine-threonine protein
phosphatase 2A (PP2A; ref. 41). Hahn et al. (42) showed that
suppression of PP2A B56g expression could substitute for SV40 st
to facilitate Ras transformation of human embryonic kidney
epithelial cells. Conversely, overexpression of PP2A B56g3 partially
reversed the tumorigenicity of these cells. Although PP2A has many
possible substrates, its role in tumorigenesis may involve
suppression of the function of the Myc transcriptional factor
oncogene. In support of this possibility, Counter et al. (43) recently
showed that the requirement for st could be replaced by expression
of a stabilization mutant of Myc. However, Hahn et al. (44) showed
that st function can be replaced by PI3K activation, and in our
system, the additive stimulation of PI3K by both constitutively
active Ras and st may drive the activation of this kinase beyond the
threshold necessary for transformation. Thus, our future analyses
will involve determining whether loss of PP2A function or gain of
Myc or PI3K function can also facilitate Ras transformation of E6/
E7/st cells and whether loss of PP2A function is important for
pancreatic cancer cell growth.
Our studies found that in contrast to other primary human cell
model systems for Ras transformation (17), overexpression of
mutant K-Ras protein was not required for growth transformation.
Previously, we have found that increased levels of oncogenic K-Ras
were not well tolerated in some nontransformed immortalized
human cells (e.g., MCF-10A breast epithelia).4 Additionally, others
have indicated that high levels of ectopic activated Ras protein may
result in premature senescence (45). Therefore, there may exist a
selection against cells overexpressing K-Ras(12D), leaving a
population of cells with moderate expression of constitutively
activated K-Ras. Thus, for our current model system, an important
advantage of E6/E7/st cells for studying mechanisms of Rasmediated oncogenesis is that artifactual observations due to Ras
overexpression will be avoided. This concern about Ras overexpression is emphasized by studies in mouse models where
endogenous K-Ras activation resulted in different cellular
responses when compared with ectopic expression of mutant KRas (46). Another important strength of E6/E7/st cells is that we
observed many of the growth transformation assays to represent
all-or-nothing phenotypes. This contrasts significantly with other
recently described human cell model systems (17), where the
immortalized cell population had already acquired properties of
growth transformation (e.g., growth in soft agar), and the
subsequent expression of activated Ras simply enhanced these
properties. We found that the immortalized E6/E7/st cells failed to
form both colonies in soft agar and tumors in nude mice and
showed no invasion through Matrigel. In contrast, E6/E7/Ras/st
cells showed very robust activities in all three assays. The potent
growth transformation caused by Ras in E6/E7/Ras/st cells
provides a very useful model system to identify both genetic and
pharmacologic attenuators of Ras-mediated oncogenesis.

Tsao et al. (26) recently described K-Ras transformation of
immortalized HPDE cells. Whereas activated K-Ras did cause
tumorigenic growth transformation, surprisingly, Ras-transformed
HPDE cells did not exhibit in vitro transformation properties as
indicated by the failure to show enhanced anchorage-dependent
or anchorage-independent growth. Although HPDE cells were
immortalized by E6 and E7 expression, no ectopic expression of
hTERT or SV40 st was done. Hence, the additional genetic
alterations used to generate E6/E7/st cells may account for the
ability of K-Ras to cause both in vitro and in vivo growth
transformation of pancreatic duct-derived cells. Alternatively, the
specific pancreatic cell precursor for the development of E6/E7/st
and HPDE cells may be different. Because both studies established
immortalized populations from pancreatic ductal tissue, it remains
possible that HPDE and E6/E7/st cells represent models for distinct
subsets of pancreatic cancers. We are currently evaluating HPDE
cells to address this possibility.
Our analyses of effector signaling found sustained activation of
Akt and RalA but not ERK. However, we did find elevated MEK
activation in E6/E7/Ras/st cells. These results mirror the situation
seen with K-Ras mutation-positive pancreatic carcinoma cell lines,
where MEK, but not ERK, activation was consistently seen. The
lack of ERK activation in pancreatic carcinoma cells was attributed
to increased expression of the MKP-2 phosphatase (38), and we
similarly saw an up-regulation of MKP-2 expression in E6/E7/Ras/
st cells. Thus, activated K-Ras does seem to cause persistent
activation of the Raf-MEK-ERK cascade, but a compensatory upregulation of MKP-2 to dampen the activity of this pathway may be

evident. Because hyperactivation of the Raf-MEK-ERK pathway can
be deleterious to cell proliferation, a mechanism to attenuate ERK
activity may be necessary to facilitate cell proliferation. The
importance of the Raf-MEK-ERK cascade in Ras transformation of
E6/E7/st cells is supported by the ability of mechanistically
different inhibitors of this signaling cascade to block cell growth.
For E6/E7/Ras/st cells, this transformation inhibition occurred
despite the fact that ERK phosphorylation was not reduced for BAY
43-9006 and MCP110 treatments. These data suggest that this
effector pathway is not simply a linear one and that signaling crosstalk is evident. Indeed, treatment of E6/E7/Ras/st cells with
inhibitors that target the Raf-MEK-ERK pathway (U0126, BAY 439006, and, to a lesser extent, MCP110) resulted in decreases in Akt
phosphorylation. BAY 43-9006 has been shown to have affinity for a
variety of other kinases, including platelet-derived growth factor
receptor, vascular endothelial growth factor receptors, Flt, and cKit (33), and although it is possible that the above data are due to
off-target action of these drugs, the fact that all three inhibitors,
which have different targets in this signaling cascade, caused
reduction of activated Akt lends credence to the hypothesis that
interaction between at least the Raf-MEK-ERK and PI3K-Aktmammalian target of rapamycin pathways is relevant in the Rasmediated transformation of human cells. The specificity of MCP110
was previously shown by the fact that this compound could block
Raf-1 activity and phenotypic transformation resulting from
oncogenic Ras activation but not ectopic Raf expression (32).
Thus, recently developed inhibitors of Raf and MEK may be
effective for pancreatic cancer treatment (47), but because we and

cells treated with inhibitors of Ras-Raf interaction (MCP110/MCP122), MEK1/2 (U0126), Raf kinase (BAY 43-9006), or PI3K (LY294002) were grown to 90% confluence
in serum starvation conditions. Plates were scratched, and after 12 h, cells were fixed, stained, and photomicrographed (A ) and quantified (B) by counting the number of
cells that had migrated into the void compared with t = 0 h (data not shown). C, E6/E7/st and E6/E7/Ras/st cell migration is dependent on ERK and Akt activity.
Parallel cultures similarly treated with the indicated drugs at the same concentrations for 12 h were lysed for Western blot analysis of phosphorylated and total MEK and
ERK proteins. Data are representative of two to five independent experiments.

inhibition may not be a reliable biomarker for monitoring patient

cells provides a powerful model system to address this question for
pancreatic cell oncogenesis. We did find that two other key Ras
effector pathways, the PI3K-Akt and the RalGEF-Ral axes, are
activated persistently in E6/E7/Ras/st cells. Interestingly, our
analyses of pancreatic carcinoma cell lines and patient tumors
found infrequent activation of Akt (8), whereas we did find Akt
activation in our cell system and PI3K inhibition did block Rasmediated growth transformation. In contrast to ERK and Akt, we
did find frequent activation of Ral GTPases (8). Our further analyses
of Ral GTPases found that RNAi suppression of Ral GTPase
expression impaired the soft agar growth and invasion in vitro and
tumorigenicity and metastatic growth in vivo for most pancreatic
carcinoma cell lines (7). Thus, our ongoing long-term studies
will evaluate the sufficiency and necessity of the RalGEF-Ral
pathway in Ras-mediated growth transformation of E6/E7/st cells.
In particular, we will determine if the related RalA and RalB
proteins contribute to tumorigenicity and metastasis, respectively,
as we have seen in pancreatic carcinoma cells. If we find a similar
important role for this effector pathway in E6/E7/st cells, it would
provide further validation of these cells for the study of Rasmediated pancreatic tumor cell growth.
In summary, our studies provide important justification for
the use of E6/E7/st cells in the study of Ras-mediated growth
transformation. Our validation of this model cell system adds to
the growing roster of primary human cell types that have been
developed using genetically defined steps to study oncogenesis.
Concurrently, we are also using RNAi approaches to silence mutant
K-Ras in pancreatic carcinomas to address similar questions. The
use of these two complementary cell culture models will provide
powerful model systems to delineate the key signaling mechanisms
by which mutant K-Ras causes and maintains growth transformation of pancreatic epithelial cells.
