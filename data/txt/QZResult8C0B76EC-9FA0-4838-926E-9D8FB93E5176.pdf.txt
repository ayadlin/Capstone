ABSTRACT
Backgrounds: Sarcopenia is known to be associated with poor clinical outcome
in patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). There is no consensus
concerning the optimal method to define sarcopenia in DLBCL.
Methods: We retrospectively reviewed 193 DLBCL patients treated with rituximab
plus cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone (R-CHOP) therapy.
Sarcopenia was classified by the region where the pretreatment skeletal muscle index
(SMI) was measured.
Results: Both the sarcopenia-L3 and sarcopenia-pectoralis muscle (PM) groups had
increased incidences of severe treatment-related toxicities and treatment discontinuation
compared with the non-sarcopenia-L3 and non-sarcopenia-PM groups, respectively. The
sarcopenia-L3 and non-sarcopenia-L3 groups had 5-year overall survival (OS) rates of
40.5% and 67.8% (p < 0.001), respectively. The sarcopenia-PM and non-sarcopenia-PM
groups had 5-year OS rates of 35.9% and 69.0% (p < 0.001), respectively. When the
sarcopenia-L3 alone and sarcopenia-PM alone groups were compared, there were no
differences in baseline characteristics, treatment toxicity, or survival. In multivariate
analysis, when compared with the non-sarcopenia-both group, OS was significantly
worse in the sarcopenia-both group (HR, 2.480; 95% CI, 1.284 – 4.792; p = 0.007),
but not in patients with either sarcopenia-L3 alone or sarcopenia-PM alone (p = 0.151).
Conclusions: L3- and PM-SMIs are equally useful to define sarcopenia, which is
related to intolerance to R-CHOP therapy and to worse survival in patients with DLBCL.
More prognostic information can be obtained when these two SMIs are combined to
define sarcopenia.

increased complete response (CR) rate and prolonged
survival, without a significant increase in toxicity, in patients
with DLBCL [1-4]. However, it is debatable whether
frail patients, who have an increased risk of treatment
complications, benefit from R-CHOP therapy because
pivotal randomized trials excluded these populations from
the analysis [1, 2, 4]. Furthermore, DLBCL patients with
significant comorbidities or poor performance status (PS)
are intolerant to R-CHOP therapy and have poor prognosis,
mainly due to treatment-related toxicities and frequent
cessation of treatment [5-7]. Recent studies have suggested
that alternative therapeutic strategies to the standard
R-CHOP regimen, such as dose modification, reduction
of chemotherapy cycles, and replacement of anthracycline
with other agents, showed a favorable toxicity profile with
acceptable survival rates in frail patients with DLBCL [812]. Therefore, clinical markers to identify patients who are
intolerant to standard R-CHOP therapy need to be developed
for individualized therapy in DLBCL patients.
Cancer cachexia is a multifactorial syndrome related
to systemic inflammation and adverse outcomes in patients
with cancer [13, 14]. Many studies have reported that
inflammatory markers and other biomarkers for cancer
cachexia can help to predict the prognosis and to improve
the performance of prognostic indices in DLBCL [1521]. Additionally, sarcopenia is known to be associated
with an increased risk of treatment-related toxicity and a
worse survival outcome in various solid tumors [22-26].
Unfavorable aspects of sarcopenia have also been evaluated
in patients with DLBCL. In a French study of 82 elderly
DLBCL patients treated with an R-CHOP or R-miniCHOP
regimen, sarcopenic patients had a higher revised
International Prognostic Index (R-IPI), more frequent
discontinuation of treatment, and a higher risk of death than
did non-sarcopenic patients [27]. In a Japanese study of 207
DLBCL patients who received R-CHOP or its derivative
regimen, male – but not female – sarcopenic patients had
worse progression-free survival (PFS) compared with
non-sarcopenic patients [28]. These two previous studies
used the L3 skeletal muscle index (L3-SMI), measured
by computed tomography (CT), to determine sarcopenia.
Recently, we demonstrated that sarcopenia, determined
by pectoralis muscle SMI (PM-SMI), was also strongly
associated with intolerance to treatment and with poor
prognosis in DLBCL patients who were treated with the
standard R-CHOP regimen [29]. In addition, we suggested
that the addition of sarcopenic status to IPI components can
improve the predictive power of IPI [29].
In this study, given the uncertainty about the
optimal SMI to define clinically meaningful sarcopenia
in DLBCL, we compared the characteristics and clinical
outcome between sarcopenic patients determined by L3SMI and those determined by PM-SMI who were treated
with standard front-line R-CHOP therapy. Furthermore,
the synergistic role of L3- and PM-SMIs as prognostic
markers was also investigated.

Patient population and characteristics
In total, 193 patients were included in the final
analysis. There were 116 patients in the non-sarcopeniaboth group. Of the remaining 77 patients with some
form of sarcopenia, 22, 30, and 25 patients were
classified into the sarcopenia-both, sarcopenia-L3 alone,
and sarcopenia-PM alone groups, respectively. When
the sarcopenic status was dichotomized according to
the type of SMI, 52 and 141 patients comprised the
sarcopenia-L3 and non-sarcopenia-L3 groups, and 55
and 138 patients comprised the sarcopenia-PM and
non-sarcopenia-PM groups, respectively. There were
no differences in L3-SMI between non-sarcopenia-both
and sarcopenia-PM alone groups (p = 0.132) and in PMSMI between non-sarcopenia-both and sarcopenia-L3
alone groups (p = 0.293). Both L3- and PM-SMIs were
significantly and weakly associated with BMI (R2 =
0.29, p < 0.001 and R2 = 0.04, p = 0.003, respectively;
Figure 1).
Baseline characteristics of patients are presented
in Table 1. Compared with the non-sarcopenia-L3
group, the sarcopenia-L3 group was associated with old
age, poor PS, B-symptoms, advanced Ann Arbor stage,
higher IPI, R-IPI, and National Comprehensive Cancer
Network-IPI (NCCN-IPI), and hypoalbuminemia. The
sarcopenia-PM group also had the adverse clinical
characteristics observed in the sarcopenia-L3 group,
except PS and Ann Arbor stage. When the sarcopenia-L3
alone and sarcopenia-PM alone groups were directly
compared, there were no differences in any of the
baseline characteristics.
It was found that the greater the sarcopenic status,
the worse the clinical status of patients. Considering
baseline characteristics such as age, PS, tumor stage,
and prognostic indices, the sarcopenia-both group had
the worst clinical features, while the sarcopenia-L3/
PM alone group had intermediate clinical features and
the non-sarcopenia-both group had the most favorable
clinical features.

Treatment-related toxicity and compliance
Comparisons of toxicity and compliance for
R-CHOP therapy between groups are described in Table
2. Compared with the non-sarcopenia-L3 group, the
sarcopenia-L3 group had more frequent grade 3 anemia
(28.9% vs. 14.9%, p = 0.027), grade 3–4 (34.6% vs.
18.4%, p = 0.017) and grade 4 (23.1% vs. 10.6%, p =
0.027) thrombocytopenia, grade 4–5 non-hematologic
toxicity (21.2% vs. 5.7%, p = 0.001), TRM (23.1%
vs. 3.6%, p < 0.001), and treatment discontinuation
(34.6% vs. 13.5%, p = 0.001). Similarly, the sarcopeniaPM group had more frequent grade 3 anemia (38.3%

were highest in the sarcopenia-both group, followed by the
sarcopenia-L3/PM alone group and the non-sarcopeniaboth group.

Treatment response
Data for treatment response were available for
180 of 193 patients (Table 1). In the analysis of all 193
patients, the CR rate was much lower in the sarcopeniaboth group than in the sarcopenia-L3/PM alone group and
in the non-sarcopenia-both group (50.0% vs. 65.5% vs.
85.3%, p < 0.001). When treatment response was assessed
in 159 patients, excluding 34 patients who discontinued
treatment due to reasons other than disease progression,

the difference in the CR rate was still significant between
the sarcopenia-both, sarcopenia-L3/PM alone, and nonsarcopenic groups, but the significance was lower (71.4%
vs. 83.3% vs. 92.2%, p = 0.043). There was no difference
in the CR rate between the sarcopenia-L3 alone and
sarcopenia-PM alone groups (p = 0.511).

sarcopenia-L3 alone and sarcopenia-PM alone groups, the
sarcopenia-L3/PM alone group, which comprised these
two groups, was used in further survival analyses. The
sarcopenia-both group had the worst PFS (5-year PFS,
19.1% vs. 52.4% vs. 68.5%, p < 0.001; Figure 3C) and OS
(5-year OS, 18.2% vs. 54.5% vs. 71.5%, p < 0.001; Figure
3D), followed by the sarcopenia L3/PM alone group and
the non-sarcopenia-both group.
In multivariate analysis adjusted for B-symptoms,
albumin status, and five factors of the IPI, having both
types of sarcopenia (i.e., the sarcopenia-both group but
not the sarcopenia-L3/PM alone group), was one of the
independent factors for worse PFS (HR = 2.166; 95%
CI: 1.146 – 4.095; p = 0.017) and OS (HR = 2.480; 95%
CI: 1.284 – 4.792; p = 0.007), compared with the nonsarcopenia-both group (Table 3).

Survival
The median follow-up durations were 58.4 and
52.4 months in all patients and in survivors, respectively.
The sarcopenia-L3 group had worse PFS (5-year PFS,
39.8% vs. 64.9%, p < 0.001; Figure 2A) and OS (5-year
OS, 40.5% vs. 67.8%, p < 0.001; Figure 2B) than did the
non-sarcopenia-L3 group. The sarcopenia-PM group also
had longer PFS (5-year PFS, 35.5% vs. 66.0%, p < 0.001;
Figure 2C) and OS (5-year OS, 35.9% vs. 69.0%, p <
0.001; Figure 2D), compared with the non-sarcopenia-PM
group.
When the sarcopenia-L3 alone and sarcopenia-PM
alone groups were compared, there were no differences
in PFS (p = 0.927; Figure 3A) or OS (p = 0.996; Figure

adipose triglyceride lipase leads to sarcopenia by causing
complete loss of white adipose tissue [14]. Another
study reported that IL-6 mediates sarcopenia in cancerassociated cachexia by activating FOXO3 and atrogin
[30]. Previous clinical studies reported that sarcopenia
leads to higher drug exposure, which results in an
increased incidence of dose-limiting toxicities in patients

with cancer [31-33]. Similarly, the present study showed
that sarcopenia was related to severe treatment-related
toxicities, frequent withdrawal from treatment with
consequential poor response rate, and worse survival in
patients with DLBCL. Sarcopenia was also associated
with factors indicative of poor nutritional status such as
hypoalbuminemia and low BMI. These findings were

identical in the sarcopenia-L3 and sarcopenia-PM groups.
Furthermore, there were no differences in any clinical
outcome between the sarcopenia-L3 alone and sarcopeniaPM alone groups.
An international consensus for cancer cachexia
proposes to use lumbar SMI determined by CT to define
sarcopenia [13]. In fact, numerous studies have used
L3-SMI to determine sarcopenia [24, 26-28, 33-36].
However, a recent study reported that the cross-sectional
area of the pectoralis muscle determined by low-dose
chest CT scan was significantly correlated with total
body skeletal muscle mass, as measured by bioelectrical
impedance analysis in healthy subjects [37]. The clinical
importance of sarcopenia determined by the pectoralis
muscle was assessed in respiratory tract disorders such
as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) [38]
and small cell lung cancer (SCLC) [25]. COPD patients
with lower pectoralis muscle area had more severe airflow
obstruction, worse exercise capacity, and poorer quality
of life than those with higher pectoralis muscle area
[38]. Male SCLC patients with sarcopenia determined
by PM-SMI were likely to have more TRM, frequent
early discontinuation of treatment, and poor prognosis
compared with those without sarcopenia [25]. Taken
together with these previous reports, the present study
more strongly supports our previous finding [29] that
sarcopenia determined by PM-SMI has an adverse impact
in patients with DLBCL. There is another advantage in
using the pectoralis muscle to determine sarcopenia in that
it can be easily measured due to its anatomical simplicity
[37, 38].
In subsequent analyses, we found that the extent
of sarcopenia could be classified more specifically when
both L3- and PM-SMIs were used together to determine
sarcopenia. Over 30% and 40% of the patients who met
the criteria for sarcopenia determined by both L3-SMI
and PM-SMI experienced TRM and had early treatment
discontinuation, respectively, in the present study. These
patients had a 2.5 times higher risk of death in multivariate
analysis adjusted for well-known prognostic factors,
compared to patients who met neither the criteria for
sarcopenia determined by L3-SMI nor those determined
by PM-SMI. In contrast, patients who met only one of
the criteria showed features intermediate between the
sarcopenia-both and non-sarcopenia-both groups in
terms of treatment-related toxicity and compliance with
treatment. Furthermore, their survival and level of SMIs
which did not meet the criteria for sarcopenia (e.g. L3SMI in sarcopenia-PM alone group) was statistically not
different with those of non-sarcopenia-both group. These
findings suggest that PM-SMI is not only an alternative
to L3-SMI but also has a complementary role to L3-SMI
in determining sarcopenia. Several previous studies also
proposed prognostic models that combine sarcopenia and
other clinical factors relevant to cachexia. When a score
combining sarcopenia and hypoalbuminemia replaced
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

sarcopenia alone as a prognostic factor in DLBCL, HR for
OS increased from 2.07 (sarcopenia alone) to 3.53 (higher
score) [27]. Another study performed in the same cohort
showed that sarcopenia and adipopenia can be integrated
to predict the prognosis more accurately, when compared
to the use of sarcopenia alone [39]. In metastatic renal cell
cancer, sarcopenic patients with lower BMI experienced
more dose-limiting toxicities from sunitinib therapy [26].
All of these findings imply that a more comprehensive
approach is needed to identify cachectic patients, instead
of identifying them using only sarcopenia determined by
L3-SMI alone. In addition, given that chest and abdominal
CT are routinely used in the initial assessment of patients
with DLBCL, our approach using both L3 -and PM-SMIs
to determine sarcopenic status is easily applicable in
clinical practice.
There is a debate regarding whether sarcopenia
is directly associated with poor response to anticancer
therapy. Sarcopenia results in a higher plasma
concentration of anticancer drugs [31, 32], which may
be related to better response to treatment [40]. A higher
rate of pathologic CR was reported in sarcopenic patients
compared with non-sarcopenic patients who were treated
with neoadjuvant chemotherapy for breast cancer [41].
However, early discontinuation of treatment owing
to severe toxicity may limit the efficacy of anticancer
therapy in patients with sarcopenia [40]. In patients
who received neoadjuvant chemotherapy for esophageal
cancer, the presence of sarcopenia did not affect the
rate of pathological chemotherapy response [42]. In
SCLC, objective response rate was not different between
sarcopenic and non-sarcopenic patients if patients who
experienced early discontinuation of treatment before
first response evaluation were excluded from the analysis
[25]. In the present study, treatment response became
worse according to the degree of sarcopenia. However,
the difference in treatment response became less
marked, with borderline significance after patients who
discontinued treatment due to potential treatment toxicity
or non-compliance were excluded from the analysis.
Therefore, we suggest that intensive supportive care may
be necessary to maximize and maintain the efficacy of
anticancer therapy in sarcopenic patients.
The main limitation of the present study was its
retrospective nature. This makes the results rather difficult
to interpret because of potentially inaccurate data collection,
selection bias between groups, and missing of clinically
important information such as the cell-of-origin subtype.
Although the relationship between the sarcopenic status and
the cell-of-origin has still not been confirmed, a previous
report showed that there was no association between these
two factors in patients with DLBCL [27]. Another limitation
is a small sample size, which may limit the generalizability
of findings. Therefore, the results observed in the present
study should be validated in prospective studies to
overcome the problems described above.

Definition of sarcopenia

In conclusion, we demonstrated that both L3- and
PM-SMIs can be equally used to define sarcopenia, which
is associated with intolerance to R-CHOP therapy and
poor prognosis in DLBCL patients. The use of only one
muscle index may not be enough to define sarcopenia.
Also, we expect that, when these two muscle indices are
considered together to assess sarcopenic status, treatment
in DLBCL patients can be more individualized.

The muscle mass area was divided by height,
and the values were reported according to the region
of measurement as L3-SMI and PM-SMI (cm2/m2).
Sarcopenia was defined as an SMI less than the muscle
region- and sex-specific-cut-off values suggested by Prado
et al. [34] and by our previous study [29] (L3-SMI: male,
52.4 cm2/m2; female, 38.5 cm2/m2; and PM-SMI: male, 44
cm2/m2; female, 31 cm2/m2). In this study, sarcopenia and
non-sarcopenia were categorized as follows:
Sarcopenia-L3 – sarcopenia indexed by L3-SMI,
regardless of PM-SMI (the rest are non-sarcopenia-L3);
Sarcopenia-L3 alone – sarcopenia indexed by L3SMI with a non-sarcopenic level of PM-SMI;
Sarcopenia-PM – sarcopenia indexed by PM-SMI,
regardless of L3-SMI (the rest are non-sarcopenia-PM);
Sarcopenia-PM alone – sarcopenia indexed by PMSMI with a non-sarcopenic level of L3-SMI;
Sarcopenia-both – both L3-and PM-SMIs at
sarcopenic levels;
Sarcopenia-L3/PM alone – sarcopenia-L3 alone or
sarcopenia-PM alone;
Non-sarcopenia-both – neither L3-SMI nor PM-SMI
at sarcopenic levels.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients
We retrospectively reviewed all consecutive DLBCL
patients who were treated with the standard front-line
R-CHOP regimen between January 2004 and October
2015 at Gyeongsang National University Hospital
(GNUH). Among them, patients whose baseline CT chest
and abdomen scans were available were included in this
study. Exclusion criteria were as follows: 1) younger
than 18 years of age, 2) front-line therapy other than the
R-CHOP regimen, and 3) transformation from another
type of lymphoma. This study was approved by the
Institutional Review Board of GNUH.

Muscle mass measurement

Clinical data

CT scans were performed using a 64-detector
CT (Brilliance-64; Philips Medical Systems, Best, The
Netherlands) with a detector configuration of 64 × 0.625
mm, a tube voltage of 120 kVp, a fixed tube current of 200
mAs, a pitch of 0.923, a gantry rotation time of 0.5 s, and
a smooth reconstruction (Philips “B”) filter. In the chest
CT, the whole lung was scanned, from the lung apex to
the diaphragm. In the abdominal CT, the whole abdomen
was scanned, from the diaphragmatic dome to the pubic
symphysis. The mass of the pectoralis muscle, including
the pectoralis major and minor, and the muscle mass of
the L3 region, including the abdominal wall, psoas, and
paraspinal muscles, were measured by one radiologist with
8 years of experience.
The measurement method was as follows. First,
reconstructed axial images with a 3-mm slice thickness
and 3-mm interval were analyzed at the levels of the
fourth thoracic and third lumbar vertebrae using CT
histogram software (the “X section” analysis tool of
Advantage Window 4.4; GE Healthcare). Second, the
region of interest was placed as the outermost border of
muscles using freehand manual drawing. Third, the area of
these muscles ranging from -29 to 100 HU was calculated
using CT histogram analysis. Then, the muscle mass was
calculated as the cross-sectional area. In the case of the
pectoralis muscle, the bilateral masses of the muscles were
measured separately and the two values were averaged.

Clinical data of patients were independently
collected using electronic medical record review
by two physicians (S-I Go and G-W Lee). Any
discordant data were carefully discussed among the
investigators. Baseline demographics, components of
IPI, and other clinical findings of DLBCL were reviewed.
Hypoalbuminemia was defined as serum albumin <
3.5 g/dL and elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH)
as serum LDH > 225 IU/L. Body mass index (BMI)
was calculated by dividing the weight in kilograms
by the height in square meters (kg/m2). Underweight
was defined as BMI < 18.5 kg/m2 according to Asian
standards [43]. Treatment response was evaluated
in available cases based on the revised International
Working Group response criteria [44]. Treatment-related
toxicity was assessed using the National Cancer Institute
Common Toxicity Criteria (ver. 4.0) [45]. Treatmentrelated mortality (TRM) was defined as mortality caused
directly by treatment at any time or as mortality resulting
from any cause other than lymphoma progression
within 30 days of the last cycle of R-CHOP. Treatment
discontinuation was defined as a minimum of six cycles
of R-CHOP for localized or advanced disease – and
three to four cycles of R-CHOP with involved-field
radiotherapy for localized disease – not being able to be
performed.

results of an open-label randomised study of the MabThera
International Trial (MInT) Group. Lancet Oncol. 2011; 12:
1013-1022.

Comparisons between two groups were performed
using the chi-square or Fisher’s exact test for categorical
variables and the Mann-Whitney U-test for continuous
variables, as appropriate. For ordinal data with three
categories (sarcopenia-both, sarcopenia-L3/PM alone,
and non-sarcopenia-both), the chi-square test for trend and
Kruskal-Wallis test were performed for categorical and
continuous variables, respectively. Correlations between
continuous variables were tested by Pearson’s correlation
coefficient. The median follow-up times were calculated
by the reverse Kaplan-Meier method [46]. Overall survival
(OS) was defined as the time from the beginning of
treatment to death from any cause or last follow-up. PFS
was defined as the time from the beginning of treatment
to first progression, death from any cause, or last followup. Kaplan-Meier curves for survival data were plotted
and compared via the log-rank test. Cox regression was
performed to calculate the hazard ratio (HR) for death
and disease progression along with its 95% confidence
interval (CI). Potentially significant variables (p < 0.10) on
univariate analysis were included in multivariate analysis.
A value of p < 0.05 was considered to be statistically
significant. All statistical analyses were conducted using
Stata software (ver. 14.0; Stata Corp., College Station,
Texas).
