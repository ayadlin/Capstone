Ifosfamide, Carboplatin, and Etoposide for Neuroblastoma
A High-Dose Salvage Regimen and Review of the Literature
Brian H. Kushner, MD; Shakeel Modak, MD; Kim Kramer, MD; Ellen M. Basu, MD, PhD;
Stephen S. Roberts, MD; and Nai-Kong V. Cheung, MD, PhD

BACKGROUND: The authors report a retrospective analysis of high-dose ifosfamide, carboplatin, and etoposide (HD-ICE) for patients
with refractory or relapsed neuroblastoma (NB). A major reason for using this regimen was the long time since patients received previous treatment with a platinum compound. The authors also summarized the published experience on ICE in patients with NB.
METHODS: Treatment comprised ifosfamide (2000 mg/m2 daily for 5 days), carboplatin (500 mg/m2 daily for 2 days), and etoposide
(100 mg/m2 daily for 5 days). Patients who had poor hematologic reserve (platelet count <100,000/lL) from previous therapy
received peripheral blood stem cells (PBSCs) after HD-ICE. Disease status before and after HD-ICE was defined according to International Neuroblastoma Response Criteria (expanded to include 123I-metaiodobenzylguanidine findings). Publications that were informative about ICE for NB were reviewed. RESULTS: Seventy-four patients received 92 cycles of ICE, including 37 patients who received
PBSC rescue. Grade 3 toxicities were rare: 1–3 patients had encephalopathy, mucositis, or gastroenteritis. Bacteremia was documented in 24 of 92 cycles (26%). The absolute neutrophil count reached 500/lL on day 17–30 (median, day 22) in patients who had
satisfactory hematologic reserve. Disease regressions (major and minor responses) were achieved by 14 of 17 patients (82%) with a
new relapse, 13 of 26 patients (50%) with refractory NB, and 12 of 34 patients (35%) who were treated for progressive disease during
chemotherapy (P ¼ .005). In the literature, patients received ICE at lower dosages and achieved major response rates >36% in phase
1 and 2 studies (in which less comprehensive staging evaluations were used) that involved resistant NB and >70% in induction for
newly diagnosed NB. CONCLUSIONS: HD-ICE is appealing as salvage treatment or consolidative therapy because of its anti-NB activity and the low risk of major nonhematologic toxicity. PBSC support is unnecessary for patients who had intact hematologic reserve.

INTRODUCTION
Standard chemotherapy for high-risk neuroblastoma (NB) includes dose-dense or dose-intensive and myeloablative regimens using alkylators, platinum compounds, topoisomerase-II inhibitors, and, most recently, the topoisomerase-I inhibitor topotecan.1 The most common salvage regimens for resistant NB combine topoisomerase-I inhibitors (topotecan,
irinotecan) with alkylators (cyclophosphamide, temozolomide),2-4 topoisomerase-II inhibitors (doxorubicin, etoposide),5,6 or both classes of drugs.7 For salvage purposes, in addition to regimens that combine a topoisomerase-I inhibitor
and an alkylator,8-11 we have used high-dose ifosfamide, carboplatin, and etoposide (HD-ICE).
The development of HD-ICE was based on several considerations. Most important, in patients with resistant NB, a
prolonged period has often passed since prior exposure to platinum compounds (which have excellent anti-NB activity);
this time gap is attributable to common use of the above-mentioned salvage regimens. Second, the combination’s lack of
cardiotoxicity, hepatotoxicity, and gastrointestinal toxicity is appealing, and there is little risk of undue morbidity (eg,
mucositis or nephrotoxicity).12-14 Third, ototoxicity is a concern in this patient population, but hearing is minimally
affected by carboplatin in nonmyeloablative doses. Finally, risks from myelosuppression were deemed acceptable with a)
standard supportive measures in patients who have adequate bone marrow (BM) reserve, or b) infusion of peripheral
blood stem cells (PBSCs) in patients who have poor hematologic reserve because of prior therapy. The overall toxicity profile supported the feasibility of high dosing, which carried promise of overcoming chemoresistance.15,16 In the current
report, we address the use of ICE for NB by presenting a large experience with a high-dose salvage regimen and a literature
review.

These included 1 patient who previously received HD-ICE for PD during therapy, 1 patient who received HD-ICE for both primary and secondary refractory
disease, and one patient who was treated twice (at separate time points) for secondary refractory disease.
b
These included 5 patients who received previous treatment for a new relapse, refractory disease, or consolidation and 1 patient who was treated twice (at

MATERIALS AND METHODS
This retrospective study covered all patients at Memorial
Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC) who received
HD-ICE for resistant, high-risk NB between October
2004 and March 2012 (Table 1). Like other MSKCC retrieval regimens,3,8-11 toxicity of major organs had to be
grade 2 (National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity
Criteria). In accordance with MSKCC rules, informed
written consents for treatment were obtained from guardians who understood each agent’s toxicities, the certainty
of pancytopenia with possible infection or hemorrhage,
and the risks of unforeseen toxicities. The guardians were
uniformly well versed in toxicity issues, given the prior intensive therapy received by all patients. An institutional
review board waiver was obtained for patient records.
Reasons for treating a given patient with HD-ICE
included: 1) extensive prior exposure to, and/or NB persistent or progressing after, cyclophosphamide-topotecan
or irinotecan-temozolomide; and 2) no recent (>6
months) treatment with a platinum compound (and
avoiding the toxicities of cisplatin). The patients were
grouped according to standard clinical subsets of chemoresistant disease (Table 1). Thus, the patients received
HD-ICE as treatment for: 1) a new relapse detected when
the patient was in remission and was not receiving chemo666

therapy; 2) refractory disease, including a) NB that
responded incompletely to induction (primary refractory
NB) but no prior progressive disease (PD) and b) relapsed
NB that responded incompletely to salvage therapy (secondary refractory NB); 3) PD detected while the patient
was receiving chemotherapy; and 4) consolidating a second or later complete response/very good partial remission (CR/VGPR).

Treatment

HD-ICE comprised ifosfamide 2000 mg/m2 (2-hour
infusion), with the same dosage of mesna (24-hour infusion) on days 1 through 5; carboplatin 500 mg/m2
(1-hour infusion) on days 1 and 2; and etoposide 100 mg/m2
(1-hour infusion) on days 1 through 5. Thus, the total
dosages were ifosfamide 10,000 mg/m2, carboplatin 1000
mg/m2, and etoposide 500 mg/m2.
Patients with poor hematologic reserve, defined
(like in other MSKCC studies9-11) as a persistent platelet
count <100,000/lL, received PBSCs as outpatients 72
hours after HD-ICE. Granulocyte–colony-stimulating
factor commenced 24 hours after either PBSC rescue or
completion of HD-ICE (in patients who did not require
PBSCs).

Extent-of-Disease Evaluations

Staging studies included 123I-metaiodobenzylguanidine
(123I-MIBG) scans and BM histology (aspirates and biopsies from bilateral posterior and anterior iliac crests). The
International Neuroblastoma Response Criteria17 were
expanded to include 123I-MIBG findings: CR indicated
no evidence of NB in all studies; VGPR, primary mass
reduced >90%, no evidence of distant disease, and normal catecholamines; partial response (PR), a decrease
>50% in measurable disease, an improved 123I-MIBG
scan in all lesions, and 1 positive BM site; mixed
response (MR), a decrease >50% in any lesion with a
decrease <50% in any other lesion and an 123I-MIBG
scan improved in some but not all sites; stable disease
(SD), a decrease <50% but an increase <25% in any
existing lesion; and PD, new lesion or an increase >25%
in a known lesion.
Literature Review

Standard search methods were used to identify publications that were informative about ICE for patients
with NB.
RESULTS
Patient Characteristics

The 74 patients (62% males) included 8 patients who
received treatment at 2 (n ¼ 7) or 3 (n ¼ 1) separate time
points (Table 1). All 74 patients had previously been
treated on group-wide or single-institutional high-risk
protocols. Prior treatment included ifosfamide in 7
patients (9%), high-dose cyclophosphamide (140 mg/kg
per cycle or 4200 mg/m2 per cycle) in 74 patients
(100%), high-dose carboplatin (>1000 mg/m2 per cycle)
and/or cisplatin (200 mg/m2 per cycle) in 69 patients
(93%; the other 5 patients received lower dose cisplatin or
carboplatin), and etoposide in 74 patients (100%).
Comparison of Response Rates by Group

Major responses (CR, VGPR, and PR) occurred in 9 of
17 patients (53%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 28%77%) who were treated for a new relapse versus 4 of 26
patients (15%; 95% CI, 4%-35%) who were treated for
refractory NB and 1 of 34 patients (3%; 95% CI, from
<1% to 15%) who were treated for PD that developed on
chemotherapy (P < .0005; exact test) (Table 2). Disease
regression (major responses and MRs) was documented in
14 of 17 patients (82%; 95% CI, 57%–96%) with a new
relapse versus 13 of 26 patients (50%; 95% CI, 30%–
70%) with refractory NB and in 12 of 34 patients (35%;
95% CI, 20%–54%) with PD who were receiving chemotherapy (P ¼ .005; exact test).

Details of Responses by Group

Among the 17 patients who were treated for new relapses
that occurred off chemotherapy (Table 1), the time from
prior chemotherapy to relapse was <12 months in 14
patients. The 9 major responses involved BM alone (n ¼
3), bones (MIBG scan; n ¼ 1), soft tissue alone (n ¼ 4),
and soft tissue plus BM (n ¼ 1). Four MRs involved soft
tissue masses, and 1 MR included CR in BM (Table 2).
Patients who were treated for refractory NB (Table
1) included 4 with NB that was resistant to induction (primary refractory disease); the others received HD-ICE for
relapsed NB that was resistant to salvage (secondary refractory disease). The 4 major responses (Table 2)
included 1 CR of NB in BM (by histology and MIBG
scan); 1 CR by MIBG scan; 1 PR with a CR in BM by histology and MIBG scan but an incomplete response of soft
tissue disease; and 1 PR with CR in BM and PR by MIBG
scan. The 9 MRs involved CR or PR in BM but
unchanged/improved MIBG scans (n ¼ 5), improved
MIBG scans (n ¼ 2), a decrease in soft tissue disease (n ¼
1), and a decrease >90% in catecholamines (n ¼ 1). SD
was seen in the 1 patient in this group who previously
received HD-ICE for PD on chemotherapy (with an
MR). Two patients in this group received HD-ICE twice
at separate time points for refractory disease: 1 patient had
SD of primary refractory disease and secondary refractory
disease (treated 12 months apart); and 1 patient had SD

and a PR, respectively, of secondary refractory disease
(treated 13 months apart).
All patients who received treatment for PD that
occurred on chemotherapy had a history of multiple
relapses except for 2 who had poor responses to induction
(Table 1). Evidence of anti-NB activity included 1 PR
(CR in BM, PR by MIBG scan); 12 MRs involving bone/
BM alone (n ¼ 6), bone/BM plus soft tissue (n ¼ 4), and
soft tissue alone (n ¼ 2); and stabilization of NB in bone/
BM alone (n ¼ 2), bone/BM plus soft tissue (n ¼ 4), and
soft tissue alone (n ¼ 3) (Table 2). In this group, 5
patients had received HD-ICE 12 to 24 months before
receiving it for PD; responses of their PD were MR (n ¼
3), SD, and continuing PD. One patient was treated twice
for PD on chemotherapy (6 months apart) and had an
MR and continuing PD, respectively.
Of 6 patients who received treatment to consolidate
a second CR or greater, 3 patients remained relapse-free
(and received other therapy) at 18 to 25 months.
Toxicity

Ninety-two cycles were administered: Patients routinely
received 1 cycle, but 5 patients received 2 cycles, and 2
patients received 3 consecutive cycles of HD-ICE. The
multiple cycles caused no cumulative nonhematologic
toxicity.
Modest acute toxicity (eg, grade 1-2 nausea) allowed
outpatient treatment, but only 4 cycles (1 with and 3
668

without PBSC rescue) did not involve an eventual hospitalization for infection (see below) or febrile neutropenia.
No cycle was truncated for metabolic reasons. Grade 3
toxicities involved encephalopathy that was self-limited
but prompted discontinuation of a cycle (n ¼ 2), mucositis (n ¼ 3), liver enzymes (n ¼ 3), and gastroenteritis (n ¼
1). Cardiac and renal function remained intact. There was
no hemorrhagic cystitis.
Myelosuppression was prolonged grade 4. Without PBSC support, absolute neutrophil counts reached
500/lL on day 17–30 (median, day 22), and platelets
were transfused through day 15–32 (median, day 22).
With the 37 cycles followed by infusions of PBSCs
(>0.8 million CD34-positive cells/kg), hematologic recovery was uncomplicated: absolute neutrophil counts
were 500/lL by postinfusion day 8–19 (median, day
11), and the last platelet transfusion was on postinfusion day 3–32 (median, day 13). Blood-borne bacterial
infections were documented in 24 of 92 cycles (26%),
including in 11 of 37 cycles (30%) with PBSC rescue.
One patient had grade 3 respiratory impairment from
metapneumovirus.

etoposide12 and ifosfamide plus etoposide (Table 3).13
One group studied carboplatin dose escalation with
fixed dosing of ifosfamide plus etoposide.18,19,21 Granulocyte-macrophage–colony-stimulating factor (GMCSF) did not ameliorate myelosuppression.22 Major
responses of resistant NB exceeded 50%. Similar
encouraging results were seen in the Pediatric Oncology
Group experience, first, with a phase 1 trial that also
investigated carboplatin dose escalation with fixed dosing of ifosfamide plus etoposide and, subsequently, with
a phase 2 trial of ifosfamide 6000 mg/m2, carboplatin
635 mg/m2, and etoposide 300 mg/m2.20 That dosing
was used in a phase 1 study of amifostine, but this chemoprotectant caused grade 3 and 4 toxicities.23 The
studies described above did not specify whether NB
responses included MIBG scans or BM findings.
In Children’s Cancer Group studies that used higher
dosing than previously reported in children (ifosfamide,
9000 mg/m2; carboplatin, 800 mg/m2; etoposide 500
mg/m2), GM-CSF/interleukin-3 fusion protein,24 GCSF,25 and interleukin-6 plus G-CSF,26 produced no hematologic benefit; and the large patient population
included only 2 cases of NB.27 The studies pointed to a
better response rate of refractory or recurrent sarcomas to
this ICE regimen compared with lower dose ICE or 2drug carboplatin-etoposide or ifosfamide-etoposide
regimens.27
Recently, ICE at dosages higher than in preceding
phase 1 studies a) was used as salvage, with major
responses in 24/64 (36%) patients treated for primary
refractory or progressive NB28; and b) was included in
induction regimens for patients with newly diagnosed NB
with responses defined according to International Neuroblastoma Response Criteria29-31 (Table 3). In previously
untreated patients, ICE achieved a >70% major response
rate.19,29 Elsewhere, ICE was incorporated into induction
after other combinations had been administered.30,31
Thus, Sung et al initially reserved ICE for NB that was resistant to combined cisplatin, etoposide, doxorubicin, and
cyclophosphamide (CEDC) for 5 cycles.30 Encouraging
results (not detailed) prompted a change to alternating
cycles of CEDC and ICE in induction. The report covered 52 patients; induction was followed by tandem transplantation, and the 5-year event-free survival rate was
62.1%  13.7%.
De Ioris et al enrolled 35 patients with newly diagnosed NB on a study with induction comprising highdose cyclophosphamide/topotecan (HD-Cy/To) for 2
cycles followed by ICE for 2 cycles (Table 3).31 Responses
were assessed immediately pre-ICE and post-ICE. AntiCancer

February 1, 2013

NB activity of ICE was evident by the following changes
compared with findings at diagnosis: The BM response
rate rose from 40% post-HD-Cy/To to 67% post-ICE;
tumor volume decreased from a mean of 57%  23%
post-HD-Cy/To to 74%  22% post-ICE; and the overall major response rate improved from 58% post-HD-Cy/
To to 90% post-ICE. Among the 14 patients with metastatic NB who had not achieved a major response postHD-Cy/To, 11 (79%) did so with ICE.
DISCUSSION
The large experience reported herein resulted from our
turning to HD-ICE in a variety of difficult clinical situations among the many NB patients who were referred to
MSKCC for salvage therapy. These patients typically have
relapsed on clinical trials or are ineligible for investigative
studies because of clinical problems, such as thrombocytopenia. In many of these patients, the long time gap from
prior exposure to a platinum agent, often because of salvage therapies that include topoisomerase-I inhibitors
(topotecan, irinotecan), supports integrating HD-ICE
into an aggressive treatment plan aimed at ablating refractory NB or controlling progressing NB.
ICE in lower dosages has activity against various
solid tumors,18-31 but it may be particularly suitable for
treating NB. Thus, NB is sensitive to all 3 components,
whereas other major pediatric solid tumors (eg, Ewing sarcoma) are relatively resistant to platinum compounds.
Combinations of 2 components of ICE (carboplatin plus
etoposide12 and ifosfamide plus etoposide13) have well
established anti-NB activity. The same holds for 2-drug
combinations of related agents, namely, cyclophosphamide plus carboplatin,32 cyclophosphamide plus etoposide,33 and cisplatin plus etoposide.34 Indeed, a literature
review (Table 3) amply documents the activity of ICE
against newly diagnosed as well as resistant NB and provides a broader context for this synergistically interacting
3-drug combination than our single-institution experience with HD-ICE. Comparisons of response rates
between HD-ICE versus lower dose ICE regimens in published reports are of limited value, because the latter do
not specify whether patients underwent BM tests and
MIBG scans.18,20-23
We previously reported that response to salvage
chemotherapy is significantly more likely in patients with
NB who are treated for a new relapse that occurs off therapy than in patients who are treated for NB that is persistent (ie, refractory) or progressing on treatment.9 Results
with HD-ICE are consistent with that observation as
regards major responses (CR/VGPR/PR; P < .0005) as
669

Original Article

well as disease regressions overall (major responses and
MRs; P ¼ .005). These statistical analyses were possible
because of the large study population (Table 1) and make
it clear that anti-NB activity may be erroneously overlooked if a novel treatment is assessed in subsets of
patients who are unlikely to respond to any therapy. However, even in patients who were treated for PD on therapy,
HD-ICE demonstrated anti-NB effects, with SD or better
in 22 of 34 patients (65%) (Table 2), including 3 patients
who received a second or third cycle of HD-ICE. Four
other patients also received 2 or 3 consecutive cycles
(Table 2). Because administering 2 or 3 consecutive cycles
of HD-ICE entailed no cumulative toxicity, multiple
cycles may be warranted in patients who have a response.
In devising HD-ICE, high dosing was chosen to
exploit the dose-response relation of NB and other tumors
to alkylators, including ifosfamide.15,16,27 Furthermore,
prior experience with lower dose ICE,18-30 or comparable
dosages of 2 components of ICE,12,13 confirmed that the
common extramedullary toxicities of ICE (hemorrhagic
cystitis and renal dysfunction) could be prevented or readily managed. Indeed, HD-ICE had modest nonhematologic side effects and produced no unforeseen toxicities in
our large series of patients who had NB that was resistant
to intensive and long-term therapy. Encephalopathy,
which is a well described toxicity of ifosfamide,35 aborted
only 2 of 92 cycles (2%) and was reversible with no
sequelae. The absence of nephrotoxicity justified both the
substitution of carboplatin for cisplatin and the use of
carboplatin with ifosfamide. An outpatient setting was
feasible because the manageable emetogenicity of each
agent plus the use of portable pumps for overnight
hydration/mesna.
The dose-limiting toxicity of ICE in past reports was
prolonged myelosuppression with no benefit from hematopoietic cytokines.22,24-26 The pancytopenia from HD-ICE
engendered no major clinical complications, infectious or
otherwise. That welcome finding was attributable in part to
the rarity of mucositis and other nonhematologic toxicities.
Bacteremia in 26% of the cycles is comparable to rates with
similarly myelosuppressive regimens.36,37
In patients who, when treated with HD-ICE, had
poor hematologic reserve (evidenced by thrombocytopenia) because of extensive prior treatment, including stem
cell transplantation after myeloablative chemotherapy or
recent 131I-MIBG therapy, PBSC rescue was received in
the outpatient clinic. Engraftment was uncomplicated,
and full hematologic recovery enabled patients to meet eligibility criteria for formal clinical trials. Collecting abundant PBSCs during induction has been recommended,38
670

because PBSC availability expands the range of salvage
options if NB proves resistant to standard treatments.
This point is evident in our current and prior reports on
salvage chemotherapy for NB8-11 as well as in experience
with 131I-MIBG therapy.39 PBSC support also has
allowed the investigation of novel submyeloablative
induction chemotherapy regimens against NB37,40 and
other solid tumors in children.36,41
We conclude that, in patients with high-risk NB,
turning to HD-ICE for salvage or consolidative therapy is
an attractive option because of noncross-resistance with
widely used retrieval regimens.2-7 The risk of excessive
morbidity from nonhematologic toxicity is low and therefore acceptable. PBSC support is unnecessary when hematologic reserve is intact.
