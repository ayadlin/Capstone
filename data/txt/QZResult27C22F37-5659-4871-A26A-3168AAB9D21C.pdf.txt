Abstract
Patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) face a dismal prognosis because of a lack of any
effective therapies. To address this situation, we conducted a preclinical investigation of the therapeutic efﬁcacy
of oligonucleotides directed against the oncogenic microRNA miR-221, which has been implicated in HCC. Of 9
chemistries evaluated, we determined that a 20 -O-methyl phosphorothioate-modiﬁed anti-miR-221 oligonucleotide was most effective at reducing proliferation in vitro. A cholesterol-modiﬁed isoform of anti-miR-221 (cholanti-miR-221) exhibited improved pharmacokinetics and liver tissue distribution compared with unmodiﬁed
oligonucleotide. Chol-anti-miR-221 signiﬁcantly reduced miR-221 levels in liver within a week of intravenous
administration and in situ hybridization studies conﬁrmed accumulation of the oligonucleotide in tumor cells
in vivo. Within the same period, chol-anti-miR-221 reduced tumor cell proliferation and increased markers of
apoptosis and cell-cycle arrest, elevating the tumor doubling time and increasing mouse survival. Taken together,
our ﬁndings offer a preclinical proof of efﬁcacy for chol-anti-miR-221 in a valid orthotopic mouse model of HCC,
suggesting that this targeted agent could beneﬁt treatment for patients with advanced HCC. Cancer Res; 71(24);

Introduction
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the third most common
cause of cancer death worldwide. Accounting for an estimated
549,000 deaths per year, it represents 10% of all deaths from
cancer (1). At its earliest stages, HCC is treatable by resection or
transplantation. Percutaneous ablation is an option in patients
who are afﬂicted with early HCC and who are not candidates
for resection or transplantation (2). Transarterial chemoembolization has been effective in patients with intermediate
stage HCC (3). Patients with HCC who are diagnosed with
advanced disease or whose cancer recurs following regional
therapy have a dismal prognosis. Doxorubicin chemotherapy
produces response rates of 10% to 15% with no survival
advantage (4). Combination therapy with cisplatin/interfer-

on/doxorubicin/5-ﬂuorouracil produced somewhat higher
response rates than single agent doxorubicin, however, at the
expense of signiﬁcantly higher toxicity (5, 6). New therapies for
HCC include epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitors (7)
and antiangiogenic compounds such as bevacizumab (8, 9) and
sunitinib (10). In a phase III trial, patients with advanced HCC
treated with the molecular targeted agent sorafenib, reported
an increase in survival of approximately 3 months (11). Clearly,
new agents must be developed to treat advanced HCC.
Extensive proﬁling studies over the past several years have
shown that various miRNAs are differentially expressed in HCC
and other types of cancers (12–20). miRNAs with increased
expression in the tumor often target tumor suppressors.
Differentially expressed miRNAs in HCC include miR-221,
miR-21, and miR-18 (increased expression in HCC) and miR122a, miR-199a , and miR-200 (reduced expression in HCC;
reviewed in refs. 21, 22). In the present study, we focused our
attention on miR-221 as a therapeutic target. miR-221 expression was increased in the HCC tumors compared with nondiseased and adjacent benign liver (12–14, 18, 20). In highly
aggressive HCCs, miR-221/-222 was among the most upregulated of all miRNAs studied (18). miR-221 targets a number of
key tumor suppressors including p27Kip1 (23–25), p57Kip2 (26,
27), phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN; ref. 28), a tissue
inhibitor of metalloproteinase-3 (TIMP3; ref. 28), and the DNA
damage-inducible transcript 4 (DDIT4), a modulator of the
mTOR pathway (18). miR-221 antisense oligonucleotides
reduced in vitro cell proliferation in HCC (18) and pancreatic
cancer (29).
Antisense oligonucleotides targeted to miRNA are effective
in mice (30, 31) and primates (32, 33). A human clinical trial

Antisense Inhibition of MicroRNA in Hepatocellular Carcinoma

using anti-miR-122 to treat hepatitis C infection has recently
been completed (Santaris Pharma, ClinicalTrials.gov). An issue
that has impeded the use of antisense oligonucleotides is the
delivery and cellular accumulation to the target organ. It is well
known that antisense and other oligonucleotides preferentially
accumulate in highly perfused organs such as the liver. Therefore, targeting the liver with anti-miRNA oligonucleotides
presents an ideal opportunity. Injection of 20 MOE antisense
oligonucleotides to the liver-speciﬁc miR-122 was effective at
miR-122 degradation, target gene upregulation and cholesterol
lowering in mice (30). Locked nucleic acid (LNA) antisense
oligonucleotides to miR-122 administered to monkeys resulted
in depletion of mature miR-122 and reduced plasma cholesterol levels (32). Primates dosed with LNA antisense to miR-122
had reduced hepatitis C virus viral load without evidence of
viral resistance or side effects (33).
The purpose of this study was to evaluate anti-miR-221
oligonucleotides as a potential therapeutic for HCC in mice.
Our goal was to show that anti-miR-221 oligonucleotides could
be delivered to liver tumors and be effective in modulating
miRNA expression and produce a functional effect on validated
targets in orthotopic human HCC xenografts. We purposed
that anti-miR-221 oligonucleotides would accumulate in the
HCC tumors, reduce endogenous miR-221 oligonucleotides,
modulate miR-221–related protein levels, and enhance the
survival of tumor-bearing mice. Our results show the successful accomplishment of these goals.

Materials and Methods
Cell lines
The PLC/PRF/5 cell line was purchased from American Type
Tissue Collection prior to 2005. The PLC/PRF/5 cells were
authenticated using short tandem repeat analysis in March,
2011 by Johns Hopkins University. Our analysis showed that the
cells were successfully authenticated. Cells were cultured in
RPMI-1640 medium with 10% FBS using standard conditions.
PLC/PRF/5 cells were stably transfected with luciferase (luc)
expressing construct to generate PLC/PRF/5-luc cells.
Oligonucleotides
miR-221 antisense and scrambled control oligonucleotides
were synthesized from Thermo Fisher. Oligonucleotides contained the natural nucleotides and phosphodiester bond or
were chemically modiﬁed to contain a phosphorothioate (PS)
linkage, 20 -OMe, 20 -F, LNA, 50 cholesterol, or a 30 inverted
deoxythymidine (idT; Supplementary Table S1). The oligonucleotides for the mouse studies were processed for in vivo work
by the manufacturer and include sterilization and testing for
endotoxin.
Antisense oligonucleotide transfection
The cells (1,200 cells per well) were plated 1 day before
transfection and the oligonucleotides were transfected using
Lipofectamine 2000 and Opti-MEM medium (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's protocol. Transfection efﬁciency
was measured using a DY547 ﬂuorescently labeled miR-16
oligonucleotide.

Cell proliferation assay
Cell proliferation assay was carried out using the reagent
WST-1 (Roche). Cells were seeded into 96-well plates at 1,200
cells per well. On the following day, the cells were transfected
with anti-miRNA oligonucleotides and allowed to incubate for
a predetermined time (e.g., 48 hours). Fifteen microliters of
WST-1 was then added to the cell culture medium and incubated for 2 hours. Sample absorbance was analyzed using a
microplate ELISA reader at 490 nm. All experiments were
carried out at least in triplicate.
Quantitative PCR of microRNA
The mature miRNA was quantiﬁed by quantitative PCR
(qPCR) using the TaqMan microRNA Assays (Applied Biosystems). The references gene was 18S rRNA. qPCR (10 mL
reaction) was carried out using 1 mL of a 1:50 dilution of cDNA.
Duplicate PCRs were carried out for each miRNA. The mean CT
was determined from the duplicate PCRs and the data were
presented using the comparative CT method.
Pilot pharmacokinetic studies
All animal experiments were carried out under protocols
approved by the Ohio State University Institutional Laboratory
Animal Care and Use Committee. Female C57BL/6 mice were
obtained from Harlan Sprague Dawley and maintained in a
clean room with a 12-hour light–dark cycle and provided food
and water ad libitum. A cholesterol-modiﬁed isoform of antimiR-221 (chol-anti-miR-221) and unmodiﬁed anti-miR-221
(non-chol-anti-miR-221) were freshly formulated with PBS and
administrated to mice through tail vein injection at the dose of
7.5 mg/kg. After administration, mice were euthanized at
various time points between 5 minutes and 36 hours with
carbon dioxide followed immediately by exsanguination via
cardiac puncture. Blood samples were transferred to lithium
heparin tubes and centrifuged at 6,000  g for 2 minutes. Liver
tissue was ﬂash frozen. Liver and plasma were stored at 80 C
until analysis.
qPCR of anti-miR-221 for pharmacokinetic analysis
To conduct the pharmacokinetic studies, we developed a
novel qPCR method to assay anti-miR-221 in plasma and tissue
(additional details provided in the legend to Supplementary
Fig. S1). Because the 30 cholesterol interfered with the reverse
transcription (data not shown), the cholesterol label was
moved to the 50 end of the oligo and in its place a 30 inverted
idT was added to inhibit 30 exonuclease activity. This compound is referred to here as chol-anti-miR-221 and is essentially identical to the antagomiR chemistry (31) with the
exception of the aforementioned changes to the 50 and 30 ends
of the oligo. To quantitatively assay the amount of anti-miR221 in mouse plasma and tissue homogenate samples, duplicate standard curves were produced in control plasma and
liver homogenate using 1 to 109 copies of anti-miR-221 oligo
per PCR (representative curves were shown in Supplementary
Fig. S1A and S1B). Two microliters of samples from standard
curves and mouse blood and liver homogenates was used to
synthesize the ﬁrst-strand cDNA as described in reference (34)
using primers and probes speciﬁc to the anti-miR-221 oligo.

Accuracy and precision of the PCR assay were determined for
both intra- and interruns. Coefﬁcient of variation is an indication of precision. The percentage relative error at three
concentrations of oligonucleotide, representing the entire
range of samples analyzed, was summarized in Supplementary
Table S2.
Pharmacokinetic analysis
Pharmacokinetic data analysis and modeling were carried
out using WinNonlin v.5.2 (Pharsight). Noncompartmental
analyses were completed with uniform weighting and linear
trapezoidal AUC calculations. For compartmental analysis, 2and 3-compartment models were used for non-chol-anti-miR221 and chol-anti-miR-221, respectively.
Western blot analysis
Protein was harvested using CellLytic MT (Sigma-Aldrich)
and 1 protease and phosphatase inhibitor (Pierce) using
standard techniques. Protein concentration was measured
using the BCA Protein Assay Kit (Pierce). Thirty micrograms
of total protein extract was separated on a 10% SDS-PAGE gel.
Blotting was carried out for p27Kip1, p57kip2, and PTEN (Santa
Cruz Biotechnology). b-Actin (Abcam) was used as the loading
control. Secondary horseradish peroxidase antibody was
detected using the ECL Western Blotting Analysis System
(Amersham Biosciences).

was carried out on the FFPE sections of tumor tissue as
described (36) and were blinded to the experimental conditions. Nuclear fast red was used as the counterstain. p27Kip1, Ki67, and cleaved caspase-3 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were
detected using standard immunohistochemistry techniques.
Colocalization analysis was carried out with the Nuance system from Cambridge Research Institute (Woburn, MA) according to their speciﬁcations.

Results
Evaluation of chemically modiﬁed anti-miR-221
The natural oligonucleotide chemistry (20 -OH and phosphodiester backbone) as well as 8 chemical modiﬁcations of the
anti-miR-221 and scrambled control oligonucleotides (Supplementary Table S1) were evaluated. The anti-proliferative activity of the modiﬁed anti-miR-221 or scrambled control oligos
was studied in PLC/PRF/5 cells following Lipofectamine transfection. The most effective chemical modiﬁcation at reducing
cell proliferation was the 20 -OMe, PS; reducing cell proliferation
by 25% at both the 48- and 72-hour time points (Supplementary

Northern blotting
Total RNA was isolated from the frozen mouse tissues using
TRIzol reagent (Life Technologies) or RNeasy Plus Mini kit
(Qiagen) following the manufacturer's protocol. Northern
blotting was carried out as previously described (35). LNA
probes speciﬁc to the mature miR-221 were purchased from
Exiqon.
Establishment of murine orthotopic HCC xenografts
Orthotopic tumors were established by the direct intrahepatic injection of PLC/PRF/5-luc cells (1,000,000 cells suspended in Matrigel) into the left hepatic lobe. Starting 10 to
14 days after orthotopic implantation, and every week thereafter, tumor burden was determined by bioluminescence
imaging using the IVIS200 Imaging System (Xenogen Corp.),
10 minutes after intraperitoneal administration of 150 mg/kg
body weight D-luciferin (Gold Biotechnology). Once bioluminescence exceeded 1  106 photons/s, mice were randomized
to receive either 60 mg/kg chol-anti-miR-221 (n ¼ 7) or chollabeled scrambled control antisense oligonucleotide (n ¼ 5) 3
days a week, for 2 weeks, intravenously. Body weight was
measured and bioluminescence imaging was carried out weekly for the ﬁrst 4 weeks. Tumor doubling time was calculated by
modeling the data to the standard equation for exponential
growth (At ¼ A0ekt). Mice were followed for 10 weeks and
survival curves analyzed using the Kaplan–Meier method.
In situ detection of miRNA and immunohistochemistry
LNA probes that hybridized to endogenous miR-221 and to
the miR-221 antisense oligonucleotide and 50 end–labeled with
digoxigenin were purchased from Exiqon. In situ hybridization

Fig. S2A and S2B). Because previous work showed that a
cholesterol end label was effective at increasing targeting and
uptake to the liver in vivo (31), all of the subsequent in vivo work
was carried out using a cholesterol-labeled 20 -OMe, PS antimiR-221 (chol-anti-miR-221), and cholesterol-labeled scrambled control oligos (Supplementary Table S1).
Pharmacokinetics of cholesterol and non–cholesterollabeled anti-miR-221
Pilot studies were completed to evaluate plasma pharmacokinetics and liver distribution of both chol-anti-miR-221 and
non-chol-anti-miR-221 in C57BL/6 mice. Figure 1 displays
concentration–time proﬁles and model ﬁts for the plasma and
liver data. Estimated noncompartmental pharmacokinetic
parameters are provided in Table 1. A comparison of the
chol-anti-miR-221 and non-chol-anti-miR-221 data indicates
the cholesterol modiﬁcation signiﬁcantly alters anti-miR-221
oligonucleotide pharmacokinetics. Figure 1A indicates a prolonged distribution phase of chol-anti-miR-221, resulting in
signiﬁcantly increased plasma area under the curve (AUClast
74.4 vs. 7.3 h mg/ml for chol-anti-miR-221 and non-chol-anti-

miR-221, respectively). This altered pharmacokinetic behavior
is reﬂected in the liver data (Fig. 1B), which indicates approximately 50-fold higher maximum concentrations (Cmax) and
AUCs of chol-anti-miR-221 than non-chol-anti-miR-221. The
modiﬁed pharmacokinetic properties of chol-anti-miR-221
show the cholesterol modiﬁcation achieves the desired effects
of increasing concentrations and prolonging exposures of the
anti-miR-221 in liver tissue.
Hepatic accumulation and activity of chol-anti-miR-221
in normal and tumor-bearing mice
C57BL/6 mice were injected via the tail vein with 7.5 mg/kg
of chol-anti-miR-221 3 times over a 10-day period; mice were
then sacriﬁced at days 11, 14, and 17. The amount of endogenous miR-221 in the whole liver was reduced by about 2-fold at
day 11, but the effect was short lived with no signiﬁcant change
in miR-221 levels at days 14 and 17 (data not shown). For this
reason we increased the dose to 30 mg/kg. C57BL/6 mice
injected with 3 daily doses of 30 mg/kg via the tail vein were
sacriﬁced on days 4 and 7 and the amount of chol-anti-miR-221
and endogenous miR-221 was assayed in whole liver. Both
qPCR and Northern blotting showed that chol-anti-miR-221
signiﬁcantly reduced the levels of endogenous miR-221 (Fig. 2A
and B). The reduction in endogenous miR-221 correlated with
increased accumulation of the chol-anti-miR-221 in the liver
(Fig. 2A and C). Endogenous miR-221 was reduced by 80% and
90% at days 4 and 7, respectively (Fig. 2A). The expression of 4
control miRNAs was not altered by the chol-anti-miR-221
treatment (Supplementary Fig. S3).
Mice bearing xenograft orthotopic tumors were injected via
the tail vein with 30 or 60 mg/kg of the chol-anti-miR-221 or
cholesterol-labeled scrambled control oligo for 3 consecutive
daily doses. Mice were sacriﬁced at days 4 and 7 and the
amount of endogenous miR-221 and chol-anti-miR-221 was
assayed in the tumor tissue. Similar to the effect in normal liver,
chol-anti-miR-221 produced a signiﬁcant reduction in the
endogenous miR-221 levels in the tumor (Fig. 3A and B). The
miR-221 levels in the cholesterol-labeled scrambled control
oligo treatment did not differ from that of the untreated
control (Fig. 3A and B). There was a trend between the
accumulation of chol-anti-miR-221 (30 mg/kg dose) and
endogenous miR-221 levels in the tumor between days 4 and
7; comparing the 30 and 60 mg/kg doses (day 7), endogenous

miR-221 decreased with increasing accumulation of chol-antimiR-221 (Fig. 3C). To determine if the chol-anti-miR-221
modulated 3 miR-221 target proteins, we assayed p27Kip1,
p57Kip2, and PTEN levels by Western blotting. Following 7 days
of treatment, the 60 mg dose of chol-anti-miR-221 increased
the p27Kip1, p57Kip2, and PTEN protein levels by 3-fold (Fig. 3D).
There was a slight increase in the p27Kip1 and p57Kip2 protein in
the cholesterol-labeled scrambled control oligo–treated
tumors (60 mg/kg) compared with the untreated control (Fig.
3D). To determine the degree of cycling cells, we carried out Ki67 staining on these tissues. Ki-67 staining was signiﬁcantly
reduced in the tumors of the mice treated with chol-anti-miR221 than those mice treated with cholesterol-labeled scrambled control (Fig. 4A and B; Supplementary Fig. S4).

To visualize the hepatic accumulation and activity of cholanti-miR-221, in situ hybridization was carried out in the liver
and tumors of orthotopic mice treated with both chol-antimiR-221 and cholesterol-labeled scrambled control oligo. Signiﬁcant accumulation of anti-miR-221 occurred in the tumors
(Fig. 4C) of mice 7 days after the initiation of therapy. The cholanti-miR-221 was predominately localized to the cytoplasm in
the tumor (Fig. 4C). Probing the tumors for endogenous miR221 showed a complete lack of miR-221 expression in the mice
treated with chol-anti-miR-221 (Fig. 4D) but not cholesterollabeled scrambled control oligo (Fig. 4D, insert). There is no
evidence of hepatocellular toxicity in the chol-anti-miR-221,
cholesterol-labeled scrambled oligo (Fig. 4E and F), or saline
control-treated mice (not shown). Colocalization studies
were carried out to determine the spatial expression of both
chol-anti-miR-221 and p27Kip1 protein. As described above,

Antisense Inhibition of MicroRNA in Hepatocellular Carcinoma

chol-anti-miR-221 was abundant in the tumors of the treated
mice (Supplementary Fig. S5A) as was expression of the p27Kip1
(Supplementary Fig. S5B). The intense yellow color in the
merged ﬁgure (Supplementary Fig. S5C) shows that p27Kip1
protein is increased in areas that contain high levels of cholanti-miR-221. There was a dose-dependent increase in the
active, cleaved form of caspase-3 in the chol-anti-miR-221–
treated tumors compared with cholesterol-labeled control
oligo (Fig. 5; Supplementary Fig. S6).
Anti-miR-221 treatment in orthotopic tumor xenograft
mice
To further study the efﬁcacy of chol-anti-miR-221, survival
studies were initiated. Nude mice implanted with PLC/PRF/5luc cells were examined for bioluminescence before the
beginning of the study. Mice bearing detectable bioluminescence (>1  106 photon/s) were randomized and then injected
3 times per week with 60 mg/kg of the chol-anti-miR-221- or
cholesterol-labeled scrambled control oligo for 2 weeks. There
was no discernable difference in either bioluminescence or
body weight among the treated and control groups at the
beginning of the study (Supplementary Fig. S7). Mice were
imaged weekly for 4 weeks. Chol-anti-miR-221 oligo increased
the tumor doubling time by 1.6-fold (P < 0.05; Fig. 6A and B).
Chol-anti-miR-221 treatment improved survival of the orthotopic tumor xenograft mice compared with the cholesterollabeled scrambled control (P ¼ 0.0470; Fig. 6C).

Discussion
In these studies, we showed the feasibility and therapeutic
efﬁcacy of selectively targeting a miRNA that is overexpressed
in HCC using antisense oligonucleotides. These observations
are novel for several reasons. First, a survival beneﬁt was
observed using intravenous administration of a therapeutic
agent in an orthotopic model of HCC. Useful preclinical
information is provided using a systemic therapy to directly
target intrahepatic tumors, an approach which is highly germane and relevant to human HCC. Next, antisense oligonucleotides were used to selectively target miRNA. Their use for
targeting miRNA has distinct advantages compared with their
use for targeting mRNA. Finally, these studies show the therapeutic efﬁcacy of targeting a single aberrantly overexpressed
miRNA, which may have multiple cancer-relevant targets.

Thus, they provide proof-of-principle for further development
of miRNA targeted therapies.

resulted in a survival advantage compared with mice exposed
to cholesterol-modiﬁed control oligonucleotides. These observations support an anti-tumoral effect of targeting miR-221,
one of the most consistently overexpressed miRNA in HCC.
Our observations show an increase in tumoral expression of
p27Kip1, p57Kip2, and PTEN by chol-anti-miR-221. These 3 cellcycle regulatory factors/tumor suppressors have been implicated in human HCC. Thus, alterations in these factors support
reduced tumor cell-cycle progression as a mechanism by which
chol-anti-miR-221 enhances survival of tumor-bearing mice.
Further support for this is provided by the signiﬁcant reduction
of Ki-67, increase in tumor doubling time and increased
cleaved caspase-3 in tumors treated with chol-anti-miR-221.
Given that a single miRNA may have multiple functional
targets, it is possible that other tumoral or systemic effects
of chol-anti-miR-221 could also contribute to the improved
survival. Further studies to elucidate and identify the mechanisms of increased survival with chol-anti-miR-221 are clearly
warranted, for example, the effect of chol-anti-miR-221 on the
formation of micrometastasis.
The feasibility of targeting miRNA to modulate metabolism
in the liver (30), or to achieve antiviral effects (37) has been
reported. Antitumor effects as a result of miRNA modulation
have been shown with the use of adenoviral vectors to overexpress miRNA such as miR-26 (38). Recently, it was shown
that antisense to miR-191 could reduce tumor weight in an
orthotopic mouse model of HCC (39). In contrast to these
studies, our study is the ﬁrst to our knowledge that shows a
survival advantage by directly targeting intrahepatic tumors
with anti-miRNAs. Our study provides useful preclinical information to guide further development of therapeutic strategies
using similar approaches in humans. We show here that
systemically administered naked oligonucleotides accumulate
in the normal liver and within liver tumors at very high levels.
Chol-anti-miR-221 was effective at reducing endogenous miR221 and altering miR-221 target proteins. Notably, chol-antimiR-221 was detectable (110–160 nmol/L) in the tumors of all 3
mice treated with chol-anti-miR-221 that survived for 10 weeks
(Fig. 6D). Our data parallel that of Krutzfeldt and colleagues,
who showed anti-miRNA regulation from a single dose of antimiRNA oligo 28 weeks following injection (31). The doses used

Mice were dosed via tail vein injection with 3 daily doses of 30 or 60 mg/kg of cholanti-miR-221 or cholesterol-labeled scrambled control (chol-SC). Mice were sacriﬁced 7 days after receiving the initial dose. Immunohistochemistry was
carried out to examine caspase-3 activity with anti-cleaved caspase-3 antibody. Sections were counterstained with H&E.

Figure 6. Chol-anti-miR-221 treatment in orthotopic tumor xenograft mice. Tumor-bearing mice were generated by injecting 1  10 cells of luciferase
expressing PLC/PRF/5 cells directly into the left hepatic lobe of an immunodeﬁcient mouse. Bioluminescence imaging was carried out weekly to monitor
tumor growth. Once the bioluminescence of tumor cells exceeded 1  106 photon/s, mice were randomized into 2 groups that received treatment with cholanti-miR-221 or cholesterol-labeled scrambled control oligo (chol-SC) at 60 mg/kg intravenously, 3 d/wk for 2 weeks. A, kinetics of in vivo tumor growth of
representative mice from each group receiving chol-SC or chol-anti-miR-221. Arrows indicate treatment points of oligos. B, tumor burden (photon count) and
tumor doubling time were calculated by injecting mice intraperitoneally with 150 mg/kg D-luciferin every 7 days following tumor injection and were imaged
using the IVIS Xenogen System. Treatment of chol-anti-miR-221 increased the in vivo doubling time for PLC/PRF/5 cells from 0.75  0.52 to 1.25  0.4 weeks
(mean  SD). C, cumulative survival curve of chol-anti-miR-221- and chol-SC–treated mice by the Kaplan–Meier method. Chol-anti-miR-221 treatment
improved survival of the orthotopic tumor xenograft mice (P ¼ 0.0470; log-rank test). D, chol-anti-miR-221 levels were determined by qPCR in the tumors of 3
mice treated with chol-anti-miR-221 that survived for 10 weeks. A black bar indicates mouse sacriﬁced 7 days after start of treatment. Open bars denote mice
sacriﬁced following 10 weeks of treatment.

here (i.e., 30 and 60 mg/kg) were similar to those used in
other in vivo studies for targeting liver (31). It may be
possible to reduce the dose by formulating the antisense
oligos into nanoparticles (40). Because miR-221 is increased
in a number of solid tumors including pancreas (41), non–
small cell lung cancer (28), glioblastoma (42), and thyroid
cancer (25), optimizing the delivery of antisense oligos may
be a useful approach to target tumors besides HCC. While
the 20 -O-methyl modiﬁcation used here dramatically
reduced nonspeciﬁc effects (43), the phosphorothioate backbone used in our study has been shown to have excellent
antisense activity but with sequence-independent effects on
cellular function (44, 45). For example, interaction of phosphorothioate oligos to cellular proteins such as basic ﬁbroblastic growth factor results in nonspeciﬁc effects (45). The
slight increase in p27Kip1, p57Kip2, and cleaved caspase-3 (Fig.
3D; Supplementary Fig. S6) in cholesterol-labeled scrambled
control-treated tumors might be because of sequence independent activity of the oligo backbone. Lowering the amount
of oligo is one possible way to minimize the nonspeciﬁc oligo
effects (44).
The choice of antisense oligonucleotides to miRNA as a
targeting strategy for liver cancer is attractive for several
reasons. Over the past 2 decades, major efforts have been

7614

Cancer Res; 71(24) December 15, 2011

directed to develop antisense as therapeutic agents by targeting mRNA, but with disappointing results. A drawback of
antisense has been inappropriate targeting and poor cellular
uptake in the target tissue. Our results corroborate what has
been known for many years; oligonucleotides accumulate in
highly perfused tissues such as the liver. Liver uptake is
enhanced by the presence of the cholesterol label. Unlike with
the design of antisense for mRNA, where the optimal antisense
is determined by screening dozens of potential oligos, antisense to mature miRNA is simply the reverse compliment of
the mature miRNA sequence. While siRNA has many useful
applications for gene knockdown, targeting miRNA with siRNA
is not practical. The cytoplasmic RISC complex that cleaves the
RNA target of siRNA would not be expected to cleave the
nuclear pri-miRNA. Targeting the loop region of pre-miRNAs
with siRNA required much higher doses of siRNA than what is
required for siRNA inhibition of mRNA (46). miRNA sponges
represents another option to inhibit mature miRNA levels (47),
however, these are vector-driven approaches. A more clinically
relevant scenario to interfere with the function of the mature
miRNA is to simply inhibit the mature miRNA with antisense
oligos.
Deregulation of miRNAs is consistently observed in human
cancers. Therefore, targeting aberrantly expressed miRNA is

logical and attractive if critical targetable miRNA can be
identiﬁed. The precise target gene effects of these interventions
are not readily elucidated because of the promiscuity of
potential miRNA targets. However, this does not preclude
modulation of miRNA as a therapeutic strategy when identiﬁable effects on tumor growth can be shown. Thus, the choice
of target miRNA is crucial, and careful validation is needed.
While our studies validate miR-221 as a suitable target, future
studies to determine the relative efﬁcacy of targeting miR-221
compared with other miRNAs that are aberrantly expressed in
HCC may be needed to identify the most optimal target miRNA
for further translation into clinical trials.
