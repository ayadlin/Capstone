BACKGROUND: The combination of fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, and rituximab (FCR) has produced improved response rates and
a prolonged survival in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). However, its therapeutic power is counterbalanced by significant hematologic toxicity. Persistent and new-onset cytopenia after the completion of FCR raise concern about disease recurrence, the development of therapy-related myeloid malignancies (TRMM), and infections. METHODS: A total of 207 patients with CLL
who achieved complete response, complete response with incomplete bone marrow recovery, or nodular partial remission were analyzed after frontline FCR therapy. RESULTS: Three months after the completion of therapy, 35% of patients had developed grade 2 to
4 cytopenia (according to Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events [version 4.0]). Factors found to be associated with cytopenia at 3 months after therapy were older age, advanced Rai stage disease, and lower baseline blood counts. Moreover, patients
with cytopenia were less likely to have completed 6 courses of therapy with FCR. At 6 months and 9 months after therapy, the prevalence of grade 2 to 4 cytopenia was 24% and 12%, respectively. No differences in progression-free survival and overall survival were
noted between cytopenic and noncytopenic patients or between patients with persistent and new-onset cytopenia. The prevalence
of TRMM was 2.3% and did not differ significantly between cytopenic and noncytopenic patients or between those with persistent
and new-onset disease. Late infections were more common in patients who were cytopenic at 9 months (38%) and were mostly bacterial (67%). CONCLUSIONS: Cytopenia after the completion of therapy is a common complication of frontline FCR that improves
over time, particularly for new-onset cases. The presence of persistent cytopenia (lasting up to 9 months after the completion of therapy) should not raise concern about CLL recurrence of the development of TRMM, but should encourage surveillance for bacterial

INTRODUCTION
The combination of fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, and rituximab (FCR) has changed the clinical course of patients
with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). A complete response (CR) rate of 44% to 72% and an overall response rate of
90% to 95% have been reported in the frontline setting, with significant survival improvement noted in comparison with
previously used regimens.1-4 Eradication of minimal residual disease was achieved in up to 49% of patients, with further
implications for outcome.5
However, this gain in response quality and duration has been associated with hematologic toxicity. Myelosuppression that persists at the completion of therapy has defined a new response class of CR with persistent cytopenia (CR with
incomplete bone marrow recovery [CRi]).6 Approximately 34% to 52% of FCR cycles were complicated by grade 3 or 4
neutropenia in the 2 large frontline studies published to date, and neutropenia was significantly more frequent with FCR
therapy than with the FC regimen in the German randomized trial.1,2 Major infections were reported in 2.6% of cycles1
and in 25% of patients.2 A small percentage of cycles were complicated by anemia (5%) and thrombocytopenia (5%-7%).
Analogous results were reported for previously treated patients.7-9 Hematologic toxicity was mostly drug related, with
infrequent autoimmune events reported.10

Original Article

Although there are substantial data regarding early
hematologic toxicity, to the best of our knowledge persistent cytopenia after FCR has been poorly investigated. In
a large study evaluating FCR, 19% of patients (most of
whom had advanced Rai stage disease) had cytopenia for
3 months after the completion of therapy, and 28% developed later-onset cytopenia.3 A higher prevalence (31%)
was reported in a retrospective analysis including both
untreated patients and those with recurrent-refractory
CLL.11 Persistent and new-onset cytopenia after FCR
have traditionally raised concern of an increased risk of
infection, CLL recurrence, and the development of
therapy-related myeloid malignancies (TRMM).12-18 For
the latter, a risk of 2.8% at 6 years was reported in what to
our knowledge is the most recent update of the original
FCR study.3
Given the unresolved questions surrounding this
subject, we conducted a post hoc=retrospective analysis of
patients prospectively enrolled in our original phase 2
study of frontline FCR and who developed persistent or
new-onset cytopenia after treatment.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Case Selection

The current study was a post hoc=retrospective analysis of
300 patients with CLL who were prospectively enrolled in
a phase 2 study of frontline FCR at The University of
Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston between
1999 and 2003. The clinic and laboratory features were
confirmed by review of the medical records. Laboratory
testing, including conventional cytogenetic analysis and
evaluation of the somatic mutation status of the immunoglobulin heavy chain variable region (IGHV) and expression of CD38 and ZAP70 (zeta-chain-associated protein
kinase 70), were performed as previously described.19-21
Fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis was not routinely available in the study institution at the time of accrual
and therefore was not included in the current analysis.
FCR therapy was administered according to the previously described schedule.1 The National Cancer
Institute-sponsored Working Group criteria were used to
initiate therapy and to classify treatment response.22 At
the time of the completion of therapy, antiviral prophylaxis was indicated for at least 1 year, but was left to the
discretion of the local physician. The use of growth factors
during treatment and after its completion was also at the
discretion of the local physician.
To limit the influence of residual CLL on observed
cases of cytopenia, only patients achieving CR, CRi, or
3806

nodular partial remission (nPR) 2 months after the completion of therapy were included in the analysis (269
patients). A complete blood count was available for 207
patients at 3 months (6 1 month) after day 3 of the last
cycle of therapy, in 191 patients at 6 months (6 1
month), and in 198 patients at 9 months (6 1 month).
Cytopenia was defined as grade 2 to 4 hematologic toxicity according to Common Terminology Criteria for
Adverse Events (version 4.0): an absolute neutrophil
count < 1.5 3 109=L, hemoglobin < 10 g=dL, and a platelet count < 75 3 109=L. Cytopenia that lasted from the
time of the 3-month evaluation was defined as persistent,
whereas cytopenia arising at 6 months or 9 months and
not described at the time of the previous evaluation was
defined as new-onset cytopenia.
All patients provided written informed consent.
Statistical Analysis

Progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS)
were calculated from the date of treatment to the date of
disease recurrence and death, respectively. Survival distributions were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method,
and univariate comparisons were made using the log-rank
test. Categorical and continuous variables were compared
using the chi-square or Fisher exact tests or the MannWhitney U test, as appropriate. All P values were 2-sided
and considered significant at < .05.
RESULTS
Cytopenia at 3 Months and Comparison With
Noncytopenic Patients

A total of 300 patients with CLL received frontline FCR
at the study institution between 1999 and 2003. Of these,
269 patients (90%) achieved a CR, CRi, or nPR 2 months
after the completion of therapy. A complete blood count
at 3 months after the completion of therapy was available
for 207 of these individuals (77%).
Seventy-two of the 207 evaluable patients (35%)
were found to have grade 2 to 4 cytopenia at 3 months; 32
patients (15%) had grade 2 cytopenia and 40 patients
(19%) had grade 3 to 4 cytopenia. Baseline and treatment
characteristics are shown in Table 1, along with a comparison with the characteristics of patients who were not
cytopenic at 3 months. Factors associated with the presence of cytopenia at 3 months were older age (P 5 .02),
advanced Rai stage disease (P 5 .01), and baseline neutropenia (P 5 .04), anemia (P 5 .04), and thrombocytopenia (P 5 .001). Baseline renal function did not appear
to differ significantly between the 2 groups (P 5 .63).

(P 5 .001).
Follow-Up at 6 Months and 9 Months

Follow-up complete blood count results were available in
191 patients at 6 months and in 198 patients at 9 months.
At 6 months, 45 patients (24%) had cytopenia: 20
patients (10%) had grade 2 cytopenia and 25 patients
(13%) had grade 3 to 4 cytopenia. Cytopenia was persistent from the time of the previous evaluation (3 months)
in 32 patients (71%) and of new onset in 13 patients
(29%). Grade 3 to 4 cytopenia was observed in 20 of the
32 patients with persistent cytopenia (63%) and 5 of the
13 new-onset cases (38%); 11 of the 13 new-onset cases
(85%) had a grade 1 cytopenia present at 3 months of follow-up.
Cancer

November 1, 2013

At 9 months, cytopenia was reported in 24 patients
(12%) and was grade 2 in 8 patients (4%) and grade 3 to
4 in 16 patients (8%). Cytopenia was persistent from the
previous evaluation (6 months) in 22 patients (92%) and
was of new onset in 2 patients (8%). Grade 3 to 4 cytopenia was reported in 16 of the 22 persistent cases (73%)
and both of the new-onset cases. Both patients with newonset cytopenia had grade 1 cytopenia at 6 months.
Progression-Free and Overall Survival

After a median follow-up of 114 months (range, 7-155
months), the median PFS for patients who were cytopenic
at 3 months was 135 months and the OS had not been
reached. No significant differences in PFS (P 5 .31) or
OS (P 5 .8) were observed between patients with cytopenia at 3 months and those without (Fig. 1). No differences
in PFS (P 5 .08) or OS (P 5 .46) were observed between
patients who were cytopenic at 6 months versus those who
were not (Fig. 1); among patients with cytopenia at 6
months, no statistically significant differences in PFS
(P 5 .84) or OS (P 5 .86) were observed between

persistent and new-onset cases. No differences in PFS
(P 5 .21) and OS (P 5 .71) were reported between
patients who were cytopenic at 9 months and noncytopenic patients (Fig. 1); among patients who were cytopenic at 9 months, no differences in PFS and OS were
reported between persistent and new-onset cases (P value
not significant [NS]). No significant differences in PFS
and OS were observed when patients with cytopenia at
any time were compared with patients without cytopenia
(P 5 .19 and P 5 .98, respectively).
TRMM and Infections

During follow-up, TRMM were observed in 2 patients
who were cytopenic at 3 months (2.8%) and in 2 patients
who were cytopenic at 6 months (4%); no cases of
TRMM were observed among patients who were cytopenic at 9 months. The prevalence did not differ significantly from that observed in patients who were not
cytopenic at 3 months (5 patients; 3.7%) (P value NS), 6
months (4 patients; 3%) (P value NS), and 9 months (7
patients; 4%) (P value NS). Among patients who were
cytopenic at 6 months and 9 months, no differences in the
incidence of TRMM were observed between patients with
persistent and those with new-onset disease (P value NS
for both). In addition, no differences in the incidence of
TRMM were reported when comparing patients who
were cytopenic at any time with those who were not
(P 5 .70).
During the years of remission, major (grade 3 or 4)
infections were observed in 15 patients who were cytopenic at 3 months (21%), 10 patients who were cytopenic
at 6 months (22%), and 9 patients who were cytopenic at
9 months (38%). When compared with noncytopenic
patients, the incidence of infections was significantly
higher for patients who were cytopenic at 9 months (38%
vs 14%; P 5 .009), but not for patients who were cytopenic at 3 months (22% vs 15%; P 5 .25) or 6 months
(22% vs 16%; P 5 .38). Infections reported for patients
who were cytopenic at 9 months were bacterial (6
patients), zoster reactivations (2 patients), and aspergillus
pneumonia (1 patient) and 3 patients had grade 2 to 4
neutropenia at the time of infection. The distribution of
infectious etiologies did not differ significantly when
compared with patients who were not cytopenic at 9
months (25%) (P 5 .26). Among patients who were cytopenic at 6 months and 9 months, no differences in infection rates were observed between persistent and new-onset
cases (P 5 .70 and P 5 .13, respectively). No differences
in infection rates were reported when patients who were
cytopenic at any time were compared with patients who

were noncytopenic at any time (P 5 .13). Most of the
major infections were reported within 18 months of the
completion of therapy and a plateau was reached after 48
months (Fig. 2).
DISCUSSION
Chemoimmunotherapy has changed the natural history
of CLL, producing a high overall response rate and
improved outcome. The predominant complication is
myelosuppression, with neutropenia being the most commonly observed hematologic adverse event.1,2 It is interesting to note that the addition of rituximab, an antiCD20 monoclonal antibody, to FC has significantly
increased the rate of neutropenia2,11 through a mechanism that is currently not well understood.2,9,23,24
Although there are substantial data regarding hematologic toxicity observed during FCR treatment, to our
knowledge few studies to date have analyzed features and
outcomes associated with persistent or new-onset cytopenia. Such cytopenias traditionally raise concern about
CLL recurrence, TRMM, and the risk of infections.
To minimize the role played by residual disease in
cytopenia, only patients who achieved CR, CRi, or nPR 2
months after completing therapy with FCR were included
in the current analysis. In the current study, 35% of evaluable patients had grade 2 to 4 cytopenia 3 months after
the completion of therapy. Persistent cytopenia was more
likely in older patients and in patients with lower baseline
counts, thereby highlighting the importance of bone

marrow reserve. There was no significant association
noted between cytopenia and renal function, although a
baseline creatinine level < 2 mg=dL was required for
patients to be enrolled in the protocol. It is interesting to
note that 40% to 60% of intravenous fludarabine is
reportedly excreted through the renal filter and a creatinine clearance < 80 mL=minute significantly increases
the risk of hematological toxicity.25 No association with
cytogenetic abnormalities was observed. However, only
conventional cytogenetic analysis was used in the current
study, and therefore whether differences could be
observed according to baseline fluorescence in situ hybridization abnormalities is not known.
The prevalence of cytopenia decreased from 35% at
3 months to 24% at 6 months and 12% at 9 months, with
a relative decrease in new-onset cases from 29% to 8%. It
is interesting to note that only 2 cases of new-onset cytopenia were observed at 9 months, making the latter a very
rare finding. No differences in PFS were observed
between patients with and those without cytopenia.
A potential correlation between FCR therapy and
TRMM has been reported previously, with the majority
of patients presenting with persistent cytopenia.15-18
However, no significant association between cytopenia
(both persistent and new-onset) after FCR and the incidence of TRMM was observed in the current study. It is
interesting to note that in the current study, the median
time from therapy initiation to the development of
TRMM was 42 months (range, 30 months-81 months).
Thus, cytopenia arising later than our observation time
could still raise concern for the development of TRMM.
In the most recent follow-up of the original FCR
frontline study, persistent neutropenia was reported in
19% of patients and late major infections in 9%3(it is
interesting to note that a threshold of 1 3 109=L was used
to define neutropenia, whereas a higher threshold,
1.5 3 109=L, was used in the current study); slightly
higher rates (31% and 10%, respectively) were observed
in a retrospective analysis of both previously untreated
patients and patients with recurrent CLL receiving
FCR.11 In the current analysis, only cytopenia observed at
9 months after the completion of therapy was found to be
associated with a higher risk of major infections, with no
differences noted between persistent and new-onset cases.
FCR treatment is also associated with prolonged lymphoid immunodeficiency,26 which makes it difficult to
strongly correlate late infections with persistent neutropenia. However, myelosuppression persisting up to 9
months may encourage surveillance for bacterial infections and prolonged antiviral prophylaxis. It is interesting
3810

to note that no cases of Pneumocystis infections were
observed in patients who were cytopenic at 9 months, despite the fact that these individuals were not receiving
prophylaxis.
In conclusion, myelosuppression after the completion of therapy is a common complication of frontline
FCR that improves over time, particularly for new-onset
cases. The presence of persistent cytopenia (lasting up to 9
months after the completion of therapy) should not raise
concern about CLL recurrence or the development of
TRMM but should encourage surveillance for bacterial
infections for an additional 9 months.
