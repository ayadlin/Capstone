ABSTRACT:
SERPINB3 (SB3) is a serine protease inhibitor overexpressed in several
malignancies of epithelial origin, including primary liver cancer, where it inhibits
apoptosis through poorly defined mechanisms. In the present study we analyze the
effect of SB3 on hepatoma cell death elicited by a panel of chemotherapeutic agents.
We report that SB3 shields cells from the toxicity of drugs with a pro-oxidant action
such as doxorubicin, cisplatin and EM20-25. The rapid rise in ROS levels prompted by
these compounds causes opening of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore
(PTP), irreversibly committing cells to death. We find that a fraction of SB3 locates
in mitochondrial inner compartments, and that this mitochondrial fraction increases
under conditions of oxidative stress. Mitochondrial SB3 inhibits ROS generation
and the ensuing PTP induction and cell death through an inhibitory interaction with
respiratory Complex I. These findings identify a novel mechanism of action of SB3
that contributes to tumor cell resistance to anti-neoplastic drugs

INTRODUCTION

can neutralize proteinases of the cathepsin family [11],
and in cancer cells it confers resistance to drug-induced
apoptosis by inhibiting lysosomal cathepsin proteases
[12]. However, under a variety of stress conditions
SB3 displays an anti-apoptotic function unrelated to its
proteinase inhibition activity [6, 13]. Indeed, SB3 protects
cells from exposure to radiation through an inhibitory
effect either on the MAP family kinase JNK [13] or on p38
[14]; in epithelial ovarian cancer cells exposed to cisplatin,
SB3 expression is associated with drug resistance and
poor progression-free survival [15], whereas it inhibits
the release of mitochondrial cytochrome c in squamous
cell carcinoma after treatment with TNF-α [16, 17] or with
DNA alkylating agents [18]. Moreover, SB3 expression
is associated with poor survival in patients with breast
cancer treated with anthracycline-based neoadjuvant
chemotherapy [19] and in patients with epithelial ovarian
cancer a high SB3 expression is a prognostic factor for
platinum resistance and shorter progression-free survival
[15]. Taken together, these observations suggest that SB3

Serpins (serine protease inhibitors) are inhibitors
of both serine and cysteine proteases [1] characterized
by a marked conformational flexibility, which allows to
control proteolysis in biological processes as diverse as
inflammation, blood coagulation and pressure regulation,
chromatin condensation, protein folding, and tumor
progression [2, 3]. Serpins can also act independently of
their protease inhibitory functions, e.g. as chaperones or
hormone transporters [4].
SERPINB3 (SB3), previously known as Squamous
Cell Carcinoma Antigen 1 (SCCA1), a member of the ovserpins/clade B serpin family [5], was originally purified
from squamous cell carcinoma of the uterine cervix [6].
SB3 is physiologically detected in the superficial and
intermediate layers of normal squamous epithelium and it
is overexpressed in neoplasms of epithelial or endodermal
origins such as lung cancer, head and neck cancer,
melanoma, and hepatocellular carcinoma [6-10]. SB3

could favor tumor cell survival under stress conditions,
even if the precise molecular mechanisms remain poorly
understood.
Most stress and survival signals converge on
mitochondria; these organelles are key players in cell
death regulation [20] and contribute in several ways to the
capability of escaping the lethal effects of stress stimuli
that hallmark neoplasms [21]. A key component of the
mitochondrial machinery that governs cell death is the
permeability transition pore (PTP), an inner membrane
channel whose stable opening constitutes a point of
no return in cell commitment to death, as it induces
mitochondrial depolarization and swelling with massive
release of Ca2+, and rupture of the outer membrane
with release of apoptogenic proteins. [22] A reduced
sensitivity of mitochondrial PTP to diverse stress stimuli
was described in in vitro and in vivo models of neoplastic
transformation [23, 24], implying that inhibition of
pore opening might be a strategy used by tumor cells
to avoid death. PTP can be induced by oxidative stress
[23, 25], and neoplasms are endowed with an enhanced
generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) compared
with non-tumor cells. This altered homeostatic redox
equilibrium is caused by several factors, one of the
most important being dysregulation of mitochondrial
respiratory chain complexes [26], which are the main
sites of ROS production in the cell [27]. Thus, in order
to set a novel homeostatic redox equilibrium, cancer

cells must boost anti-oxidant defenses, and any further
increase in ROS levels could overwhelm their residual
anti-oxidant capabilities, resulting in the unlocking of PTP
desensitization and in the selective killing of malignant
cells.
Here we show an unprecedented mitochondrial
localization of SB3, which binds respiratory Complex I,
down-modulating its activity both in basal conditions and
after cell treatment with pro-oxidant chemotherapeutics.
By blocking ROS generation at Complex I, SB3 abrogates
PTP opening and cell death induced by these drugs,
shielding tumor cells from death.

RESULTS
SB3 protects from cell death induced by
antineoplastic agents
In cancer cells, SB3 was reported to have an antiapoptotic activity under a variety of stress conditions [13,
14, 16, 17]. Thus, SB3 could contribute to the ability of
tumor cells to escape death. We chose human hepatoma
HepG2 and HUH7 cells, which do not show detectable
levels of endogenous SB3, as recipient cells to perform a
stable SB3 transfection (Fig. 1A and Fig. S1A). To assess
the survival role of SB3, we treated cells with a panel

of chemotherapeutics: cisplatin, doxorubicin, 5-fluorouracil, etoposide and actinomycin D. We found that SB3
expression protected hepatoma cells from the toxicity
of both cisplatin and doxorubicin in a dose-dependent
fashion, while it was not effective on cells treated with
5-fluoro-uracil, etoposide or actinomycin D (Fig. 1B-E
and Fig. S1B-C-F).

by cisplatin and doxorubicin (Fig. 2B and Fig. S1B and
S1E). Similar to SB3 expression, NAC could not protect
hepatoma cells from toxicity elicited by 5-fluoro-uracil,
etoposide or actinomycin D (Fig. S1C and S1F), which
indicates that these drugs do not induce oxidative stress,
and further support the hypothesis of an anti-oxidant role
of SB3.

SB3 prevents oxidative stress-induced cell death

Mitochondrial localization of SB3

Both cisplatin and doxorubicin elicit a rapid surge
of ROS, mainly from mitochondria, independently of their
effect as DNA damaging agents [28-31]. We therefore
hypothesized that SB3 could prevent cell death caused
by oxidative stress. Indeed, SB3 expression strongly
inhibited the increase in intracellular ROS levels prompted
by cisplatin (Fig. 2A) and doxorubicin (Fig. S1D).
Moreover, treatment of hepatoma cells with the antioxidant compound N-acetyl-cysteine (NAC) mimicked the
effect of SB3, in that it markedly inhibited both the ROS
surge (Fig. 2A and Fig. S1D) and death induction caused

One of the main sites of ROS production in the cell
is the mitochondrial respiratory chain, and mitochondria
contribute to the neoplastic process by regulating redox
equilibrium changes [27], energy metabolism [32] and
cell death [20]. We therefore evaluated the possibility
that SB3 could regulate ROS levels by directly
interacting with some mitochondrial components. In
keeping with this hypothesis, we found that a significant
proportion of SB3 was protected from digestion by
trypsin concentrations able to degrade proteins of
the outer mitochondrial membrane (Fig. 2C and Fig.

S1G), indicating that SB3 mainly locates in the inner
mitochondrial compartments; and that treatment with
cisplatin increased the mitochondrial fraction of SB3 (Fig.
2C). As a mitochondrial localization of SB3 was never
reported before, we checked for its subcellular distribution
in transgenic mice expressing SB3 in the liver [33] and
in other human cancer cell models, including H295R
adrenocortical carcinoma cells and SAOS-2 osteosarcoma
cells, confirming that SB3 localizes in the mitochondrial
matrix (Fig. 2D and Fig. S1G-H).

exposed to a train of repeated Ca2+ pulses, as accumulation
of Ca2+ into mitochondria induces the PTP. Since Complex
I is one of the main sites of superoxide production in the
cell [35], this experiment was carried out under conditions
that maximize the activity of respiratory chain Complex
I, i.e. in a buffer containing glutamate/malate. Our data
indicate that in HepG2 cells cisplatin sensitizes the PTP to
Ca2+ in a ROS-dependent way, as its effect is inhibited by
NAC; and, remarkably, that SB3 expression abrogates PTP
induction by cisplatin (Fig. 2E).
To gain further insights on the mechanisms by
which SB3 protects from PTP opening, we looked for
additional compounds that induce oxidative stress and
the ensuing PTP opening. The BH3 mimetic EM20-25, a
well-characterized PTP opener in several tumor cell types
[36], elicited a massive and fast death in HepG2 mock
cells, which was paralleled by a rapid increase in ROS
levels (Fig. 3A and 3B). When cells were pre-treated with
NAC, EM20-25 toxicity was totally abolished (Fig. 3A),
indicating the major involvement of oxidative stress in
the observed EM20-25 effect. Notably, SB3 expression
shielded HepG2 cells from both EM20-25 lethality and
from the ROS surge elicited by the drug (Fig. 3A and
3B). EM20-25 displayed a clear pro-oxidant effect also in

SB3 abrogates PTP opening induced by oxidative
stress
Taken together, these observations suggest that SB3
displays a protective function against oxidative insults
by impinging upon mitochondrial redox equilibrium.
Increased levels of mitochondrial ROS can lead to cell
death through opening of the PTP [23]. To test if SB3
shields cells from oxidative stress by inhibiting ROSdependent pore opening we performed a whole-cell Ca2+retention capacity (CRC) assay [34], which measures the
Ca2+ threshold for PTP opening in permeabilized cells

Complex I and the ensuing PTP opening.

SB3 interaction with Complex I

DISCUSSION

High levels of ROS can be generated in
mitochondria by compounds that modulate the activity
of respiratory complexes on the inner membrane. As we
found SB3 in inner mitochondrial compartments, we
investigated if it could directly interact with the respiratory
chain. Co-immunoprecipitations experiments revealed
an association between respiratory Complex I and SB3
both in HepG2-SB3 cells and in liver mitochondria of
SB3 transgenic mice (Fig. 4A and 4B). Importantly, the
physical association between SB3 and Complex I had
a functional effect, as the presence of SB3 markedly
inhibited the enzymatic activity of Complex I of both
cultured cells and mouse liver mitochondria (Fig. 4C and
4D).
Dysregulation of ROS generated by Complex I
could trigger an oxidative stress capable of opening the
PTP [37]. Indeed, the PTP opener EM20-25 strongly
increased Complex I activity, and SB3 totally blunted
Complex I induction by EM20-25 (Fig. 4C). Thus,
modulation of Complex I activity could have a key role
on redox equilibrium, and on PTP opening elicited by
oxidative insults. Accordingly, CRC experiments carried
out in a glutamate/malate buffer demonstrated that
EM20-25 induces the PTP in a ROS-dependent way, as
this induction was abrogated by NAC-dependent ROS
scavenging (Fig. 4E). Remarkably, SB3 expression had an
inhibitory effect on PTP induction that closely resembled
that of NAC (Fig. 4E). Taken together, these observations
indicate that SB3 protects cells from the lethal effects

In the present work we have characterized a novel
activity of SB3 that may have important implications in
the tumorigenic process. We have found that a fraction of
SB3 is located in the inner mitochondrial compartments,
where it binds respiratory Complex I and down-modulates
its activity. By a parallel inhibition of ROS generation at
Complex I, SB3 shields cells from the noxious effects of
oxidative stress, in particular from death-inducing PTP
opening caused by chemotherapeutic agents that also act
as pro-oxidants. Since SB3 is over-expressed in several
epithelial tumors [6, 7, 9] and in preneoplastic liver
lesions, [8] it can be considered an important component
of the anti-apoptotic machinery installed by neoplastic
cells to survive the variety of stress conditions they
encounter during malignant progression. In addition, the
recently described resistance to chemotherapeutics and
the poor prognosis of patients with both breast [19] and
ovarian cancer [15] over-expressing SB3 are in keeping
with the results of this study.
Beside the antiprotease activity, a high degree of
functional pleiotropy has been associated with SB3,
including involvement in tissue remodeling during fibrosis
associated to autoimmune diseases [6, 38], induction
of TGF-β [39, 40] and of the oncogene Myc [41] and
hepatocyte proliferation after partial hepatectomy [33].
Together with its anti-apoptotic activity, all these functions
of SB3 could contribute to neoplastic progression.
Indeed, inhibition of NK cell recruitment, and of NK
cell-induced apoptosis [1], could attenuate the anti-

tumor innate immunity response, which is consistent
with increased tumor infiltration by NK cells in in vivo
cancer models after SB3 inhibition [17]. Furthermore,
SB3 expression was shown to prompt tissue remodeling
and cell proliferation associated with increased β-catenin
accumulation, which could play a role in epithelial
mesenchymal transition [42] and invasion [43] of tumor
cells.
Notably, the SB3-mediated modulation of redox
that we report here could be part of this complex picture,
as ROS contribute in stimulating proliferation, invasion
and metastasis, and in inhibiting apoptosis [44]. Indeed,
ROS play complex and multiple roles in the tumorigenic
process. Several oncogenes increase ROS levels by
unbalancing the energy metabolism pathways of the
tumor cell, which can cause electron leakage during
oxidative phosphorylation and stimulate generation of
superoxide; and a surge in mitochondrial ROS stimulates
cellular proliferation and anchorage-independent growth
[45]. Nonetheless, tumor cells must reach a novel redox
equilibrium, to avoid an uncontrolled rise in ROS
levels that would trigger a feed-forward loop involving
a progressive rise in Ca2+ concentration, a further ROS
increase and eventually PTP opening and death [23,
25]. Neoplasms must therefore utilize several strategies
to maintain a locked PTP, e.g. by the association of
hexokinase II with mitochondria [34], or by signalling
conveyed by kinases [24], such as a mitochondrial
branch of an ERK/GSK-3β signalling axis [36]. In this
framework, tumor cells could exploit SB3 as a further
mechanism of defense from oxidative insults.
The diverse functions of SB3 are paralleled by
its multiple locations, as the protein can be found both
in nuclei and cytoplasm, and it can also be released
from tumor cells [3], acting through both autocrine
and paracrine pathways [42] and serving as tumoral or
prognostic marker [46]. Here we have identified a novel
site of SB3 expression in the mitochondrial matrix,
where it is involved in an unprecedented function, i.e.
protection from oxidative stress through interaction
with the respiratory Complex I. Notably, SB3 further
translocates into mitochondria following cisplatin
treatment, which suggests its recruitment as a component
of the mitochondrial anti-oxidant machinery. Most of the
ROS generated in intact mitochondria are contributed by
the NADH:quinone oxidoreductase activity of this enzyme
[35]. The importance of Complex I-dependent oxidants
is further highlighted by our recent observation that the
Gold(III)-dithiocarbamato compound AUL12 induces
neoplastic cell death by enhancing ROS generation at
Complex I, thus triggering multiple signalling pathways
that eventually lead to PTP opening [37]. The importance
of regulation of respiratory chain complexes in cancer
cells is becoming increasingly clear , as exemplified by the
recent observations that activity of Complex I is inhibited
in models of K-Ras-driven tumorigenesis [47], and that
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

down-regulation of Complex II by the mitochondrial
chaperone TRAP1 creates a pseudohypoxic phenotype that
promotes tumorigenesis [48].
Redox alterations are postulated to make neoplastic
cells particularly vulnerable to oxidants, and indeed
ROS generation contributes to the toxicity of a variety of
chemotherapeutics. Therefore, increased understanding
of the molecular mechanisms by which SB3 protects
tumor cells from oxidants has possible implications for
developing anti-neoplastic strategies that target the altered
redox equilibrium of SB3-expressing neoplasms.

METHODS
Ethics statement
Experiments with mice were authorized by the
Animal Care and Use Committee of the University of
Padova and carried out according to European guidelines.

Cell culture transfections and SB3-transgenic
mice
HepG2 cells were cultured in Minimum Essential
Medium (MEM; Sigma, St. Louis, Missouri) added
with 10% Fetal Bovine Serum (FBS; Invitrogen Life
Technologies, Carlsbad - California), glutamine 2 mM
(Sigma), MEM non essential amino acids (Sigma),
penicillin (100 units/ml), streptomycin (100 µg/ml;
Invitrogen), and were kept in a humidified atmosphere
of 5% CO2 at 37°C. Cells were stably transfected with a
vector carrying the full length human SB3 cDNA inserted
in a pCDNA3.1 vector, mock cells were obtained by
stable transfection with an empty pCDNA3.1 plasmid,
as described [42]. The study was carried out in C57BL/6
mice transgenic for human SB3 [33]. Mice were bred at
the Animal Care Facility of the Experimental Surgery
Division of the University of Padua.

Cell viability assays
To analyze viability after chemotherapeutic
treatments, HepG2 cells were plated in 96-well plate
(2x104 cells/well) and synchronized by a 24 hour FBS
depletion. FBS was then re-added in the medium at the time
of chemotherapeutic addition. Cell viability was assessed
either with a MTS assay or by flow cytometry analysis.
The MTS assay (CellTiter 96® AQueous One Solution;
Promega, Madison, Wisconsin) exploits an improved
tetrazolium compound, MTS (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2Htetrazolium, inner salt), that is reduced by dehydrogenase
enzymes of living cells into a formazan product whose

absorbance at 490 nm is directly proportional to
the number of viable cells. To perform colorimetric
measurements, cells were washed with PBS and then
a HBSS solution containing MTS was added. Plates
were incubated at 37°C for 1 h and read in a Multiskan
EX multiplate reader (Thermo Scientific, , Waltham,
Massachusetts). Flow cytometry recordings were
performed as described previously [49, 50] to detect
phosphatidylserine exposure on the cell surface (increased
FITC-conjugated Annexin-V staining) and loss of plasma
membrane integrity (propidium iodide staining, 1 µg/ml).
Samples were analyzed on a FACSCanto II flow cytometer
(Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, New Jersey). Data
acquisition and analysis were performed using FACSDiva
software (Becton Dickinson).

Anti-SERPINB3 rabbit polyclonal antibody was
from Xeptagen (Venezia, Italy); mouse monoclonal antiSERPINB3 (sc-21767), anti Grim19 (sc-271013) and
anti TRAP1 (sc-13557) antibodies, rabbit polyclonal
anti TOM20 (sc-11415), anti Bax (sc-493) and anti
Calnexin (sc-6465) antibodies were all from Santa Cruz
(Santa Cruz, California); mouse monoclonal anti CyP-D
antibody (AP1035) was from Calbiochem (Darmstadt,
Germany); mouse monoclonal anti GAPDH (MAB374)
was from Merck Millipore (Billerica, Massachusetts);
mouse monoclonal anti NDUFB8 (20E9DH10C12) and
mouse monoclonal anti Complex I Immunocapture kit
(ab109711) antibodies were from MitoSciences (Eugene,

ROS measurements

Preparation of mitochondrial extracts

To perform ROS measurements, cells were plated
as for cell viability assays; isolated mitochondria (200
µg/well) were resuspended in a buffer containing 250
mM Sucrose, 10 mM MOPS-Tris, 5 mM Glutamate,
2.5 mM Malate, 4 mM MgCl2, 1 mM Pi-Tris, at pH 7.4.
ROS levels were detected by using the probe 5-(and-6)chloromethyl-2′,7′-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate,
acetyl ester (CM-H2DCFDA, 1 µM; Molecular Probes,
Carlsbad, - California). Fluorescence (λ exc: 485 nm; λ
em: 538 nm) was recorded using a Fluoroskan Ascent FL
(Thermo Electron Corp.) plate reader.

To prepare mitochondrial extracts, either cells or
minced mouse livers were placed in an isolation buffer
(250 mM sucrose, 10 mM Tris/HCl, 10 mM EGTA/
Tris, pH 7.4 with phosphatase and protease inhibitors)
and homogenized at 4°C with an electrical glass-Teflon
potter. Mitochondria were then isolated by differential
centrifugation (three times, the first at 700 x g to eliminate
nuclei, plasma membrane fractions and undisrupted cells
and twice at 7,000 x g, all at 4°C, 10 minutes each to pellet
and wash mitochondria) in mitochondrial isolation buffer.
Protease digestion of isolated mitochondria was performed
in isolation buffer without protease inhibitors for 1 h at
4°C. After inactivating trypsin with a protease inhibitor
cocktail (Sigma), mitochondria were spun (18,000 x g for
10 minutes) and lysed.

Respiratory Complex I activity assay and Citrate
Synthase activity assay
The enzymatic activity of respiratory chain
Complex I was assessed on freshly isolated mitochondria
or permeabilized cells (40 µg of proteins per trace).
Samples were pre-incubated for 3 min at 37°C in a
buffer composed by potassium phosphate 25 mM pH
7.4, alamethicin 1 µM, BSA 3 mg/ml, sodium azide
(500 µM), 6.5 µM Coenzyme Q1. Reaction started after
the addition of NADH 10 µM and NADH consumption
was recorded spectrophotometrically as a decrease in
absorbance at a 340 nm wavelength for 5 minutes. The
Complex I activity was calculated as NADH consumption
assessing the difference of the trace slopes with or
without the Complex I inhibitor Rotenone 10 µM. Each
measurement of Complex I activity was normalized
for Citrate Synthase (CS) activity. Citrate formation
was spectrophotometrically measured as an increase in
absorbance at 420 nm wavelength in a buffer containing
100 mM Tris-HCl pH 8, 100 µM DTNB, 300 µM Acetyl
-CoA, 500 µM Oxaloacetate, at 37°C.

Western blot analyses and immunoprecipitations
Total cell extracts were prepared at 4°C in 140
mM NaCl, 20 mM Tris/HCl (pH 7.4), 5mM EDTA,
10% glycerol, and 1% Triton X-100 in the presence of
phosphatase and protease inhibitors (Sigma). All lysates
were kept for 30 minutes on ice and then cleared by
centrifugation at 4°C and 14,000 x g for 25 minutes.
Protein quantification was performed with BCA Protein
Assay Kit (Thermo Scientific-Pierce).
Immunoprecipitations were performed on 1 mg
of proteins extracted from total cell lysates and on 300
µg from isolated mitochondria cleared with protein
A-Sepharose (Sigma) for 1 h at 4°C. Incubation with
the primary antibody (1 µg per sample) was carried out
in agitation at 4°C for 16 hours. Western immunoblots
were carried out under standard conditions, and proteins
were transferred onto nitrocellulose Hybond-C Extra
membranes (Amersham, Uppsala - Sweden) and
visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (Millipore,
Milan, Italy).

of 5 mM Glutamate/2.5 mM Malate, 10 μM cytochrome
c, and of the Ca2+ probe Calcium Green-5N (1 µM; λ exc:
505 nm; λ em: 535 nm; Molecular Probes), which does
not permeate mitochondria. Cells were then exposed to
Ca2+ spikes, and fluorescence drops were used to assess
mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake using a Fluoroskan Ascent
FL (Thermo Electron Corp.) plate reader. PTP opening
was detected as a sudden and irreversible fluorescence
increase. The Ca2+ taken up by mitochondria before PTP
opening in the different experimental conditions was then
normalized to control conditions (dubbed as CRC0).
