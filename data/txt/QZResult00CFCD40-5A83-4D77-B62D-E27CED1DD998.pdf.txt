Abstract
Peptide drug conjugates offer a novel strategy to achieve controlled drug release.
This approach avoids the clinical obstacles of non-specific toxicity and overall drug
resistance of conventional cytotoxic agents, such as paclitaxel. MMP2 plays important
functions in tumour proliferation and metastasis. Herein, we conjugated the paclitaxel
with a hexapeptide which is specific recognized by MMP2 protein. The conjugate is
dissociated upon the MMP2 specific proteolysis at COOH terminal of hexapeptide,
PVGLIG.
The results clearly indicated that the PVGLIG-paclitaxel conjugate significantly
enhanced the tumor specificity against HT-1080 and U87-MG tumour cells. Our
finding suggested that the hexapeptide PVGLIG is capable to act as a controlled and
sustained drug carrier of paclitaxel for the treatment against tumour proliferation
and metastasis with high MMP2 expression.

Introduction

agents, including paclitaxel, doxorubicin, methotrexate
and so on [16, 17]. In contrast to the original therapeutic
approach of using small molecular inhibitors of MMPs,
these novel drug-targeting strategies resulted in an
improved therapeutic index and less toxicity [18–20].
In this study, a novel MMP2 specific hexapeptide
was screened out using phage display technology, and
then paclitaxel was conjugated. Initially, the antitumor
activities of conjugate were investigated in vitro and
in vivo. Data indicated that the conjugate possessed
specificity for various tumour cell lines and tumourbearing mice. In addition, the release of paclitaxel from
conjugate was analysed using LC-MS which is crucial to
overcome the main obstacle in the development of MMP2
associated drug candidate.

Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are well
known, as they play important functions in tumour
proliferation and metastasis [1–3]. In the past
decade, many studies have demonstrated that overexpression of MMP2 and MMP9 plays a vital role in
metastatic tumour cells, promoting tumour growth and
angiogenesis in the tumour, thereby providing nutrition
to the tumour through the newly generated vessels
[4–7]. In animals, MMP2 inhibitors prevented tumor
dissemination and the formation of metastases by antiangiogenic properties [8–12].
The specific protease activity of MMPs has made
it an attractive approach for controlling drug release.
The MMPs associated peptide drug conjugate (PDC) is
designed for enzymatically metabolized prodrugs, in
which therapeutic drugs are covalently bound to MMP
substrate peptides [13–15]. The prodrug is then dissociated
with the peptides by proteolysis of MMPs. Recently,
several MMP associated PDCs have been developed in
order to improve the tumor specificity of small chemical

paclitaxel was chemically linked to the COOH-terminus
in peptide (Figure 1). Mass spectrophotometry was
performed in order to monitor the reaction and to identify
the final product (Figure 1).
A clear understanding about the dissociation of
conjugate conjugate in vitro is necessary to ascertain
the appropriate dose of the conjugate in further animal
experiments. Initially, the conjugate was incubated with
MMP2 protein and the free paclitaxel was monitored.
Result indicated that the free paclitaxel was started to
release from conjugate 2 h after incubation with MMP2
protein. The concentration of free paclitaxel peaked to a

plateau at 4–12 h (Figure 2A). The dissociation pattern
of conjugate incubated with HT-1080 and U87MG cells
exhibited similar feature with that of incubation with
MMP2 protein, (Figure 2B). However, there is almost
none of free paclitaxel dissociated from conjugate with
in the 48 h incubation with Hep-2 and Hep G2 cell lines
(Figure 2B). The specificity of conjugate in HT-1080 and
U87MG tumor cells was derived from various expression
levels of MMP2 in cells.
In addition, the cellular MTT and scratch assays
were performed for evaluating the inhibition activity of
conjugate on tumor metastasis. From MTT assay, shown

was prepared containing an N-terminal Fmoc protection group in order to avoid the by-product. The Fmoc group is removed finally using
traditional protocol. The samples were analyzed for ascertain the intermediate and final product (1428.34) using mass spectrometry. Conditions:
Fmoc-PVGLIG was synthesized using solid phase peptide synthesis protocol and the purified product was then reacted with free paclitaxel.
The final product was purified by RP-HPLC with XBridge C18 silica column and ascertained by HPLC-MS.

in Table 1, result indicated that the conjugate exhibited
improved cell viability against HT-1080 and U87MG
tumor cells compared to paclitaxel control. In coincidence,
there were no remarkable differences observed from
Hep-2 and Hep G2 cell lines treated with conjugate or
paclitaxel alone.
As known, MMP2 plays a critical role in tumour
progression, tumour angiogenesis and metastasis; thus a
cellular scratch assay was performed for investigating the
metastasis inhibition of conjugate. In Figure 3, paclitaxel
exhibited anti-proliferative activity against almost all
tumour cell lines without any selectivity. However, the
metastasis inhibiting rate in HT-1080 and U87MG cells
followed treatment of conjugate was increased significantly
than that of paclitaxel (Panel A and B in Figure 3).
To evaluate the anti-tumour effect of conjugate and
free paclitaxel, the mice bearing with tumours derived

from either HT-1080 or U87MG cells were treated with
conjugate (15 mg paclitaxel/kg body weight/5 day) and
free paclitaxel (15 mg/kg body weight/5 day), respectively.
The antitumor activities were determined by monitoring
the animal survival rate during 30 days treatment. The
results in Figure 4 revealed that the administration of
conjugate significantly increased the survival rate of
experimental mice.
In summary, an MMP2 associated drug release
system was developed based on a novel MMP2 specific
peptide substrate in this study. The hexapeptide, PVGLIG,
was conjugated with paclitaxel at COOH-terminal of
peptide. This conjugate is capable to release paclitaxel for
its conventional cytotoxic activity upon the presence of
MMP2. This novel drug release system was considered
to increase the therapeutic index of paclitaxel due to the
enhanced specific targeting activity.

Figure 2: Paclitaxel dissociated from conjugate in MMP2 solution and various cell lines. (A) Concentration of released

paclitaxel from conjugate upon the MMP2 proteolysis (B) Concentration of released paclitaxel from conjugate incubating within various
cell lines. Legend: Result indicated that the presence of MMP2 enzyme induced the release of paclitaxel from conjugate significantly. The
conjugate initiated the drug release at 2 h after incubation with MMP2 and the level of dispatched paclitaxel peaked to plateau at 12 h
(Panel A). In addition, the conjugate was incubated with various cell lines and the released paclitaxel was monitored by HPLC-MS. Results
indicated that the conjugate showed different drug dissociation characterization in various tumor cell lines. The MMP2 over expression
tumor cells, HT-1080 and U87MG, induced the release of paclitaxel remarkably, compared with those from Hep-2 and Hep G2 cells
(Panel B). The data confirmed that conjugate exhibited the presumed MMP2 sensitive activity. Condition: Conjugate containing 100 µg
paclitaxel were incubated with MMP2 (5 µg) in PBS buffer, Ph 7.0 containing 100 µM ZnSO4 at 37°C for 48 h-experimental period. Various
cells were seed in 96-well plate, and conjugate containing 10 µg paclitaxel was titrated into each well for incubation at various experimental
periods. HPLC-MS was then employed to monitor the released free paclitaxel.

the original migration inhibition effect of free paclitaxel in HT-1080 and U87MG cells, the conjugates presented a 1.4-fold and 1.7-fold
increase on anti-migration activity, respectively. However, the conjugate failed to show anti-migration activity on Hep-2 and and Hep G2
cells those non-expressing MMP2. It was assumed that the inhibitory activity of conjugate on the cellular migrating phenotype is due to the
specific release of paclitaxel upon the presence of MMP2 enzyme. Condition: The HT-1080, U87MG, Hep G2 and Hep-2 cell lines were
plated in 6-well plates and cultured overnight respectively. The cell monolayer was scraped in a straight line with a sterile p200 pipette tip,
the debris were removed by gently flushed with PBS twice. After rinsing, 2.5 mL cell supernatant (supplemented with 5% FBS) containing
either paclitaxel or conjugate (final concentration of each treatment drug at 5 mg/ml) was covered on the scraped cells and then incubated
cells at 37°C, 5% CO2 for 24 hours. The distances of cellular edges were measured by using LEICA ICC50 HD microscopy (LEICA
Microsystems Ltd, Switzerland).

well) were seeded in 96-well plates and cultured at 37°C
and 5% CO2, respectively. Free paclitaxel or conjugate was
incubated with cells at final concentrations of 0.1, 0.5, 1,
5, 10 and 100 mg/ml. The MTT solution (5 mg/ml in PBS)
was titrated into each well after an incubation period of
either 24, 48 or 72 hours. A traditional MTT protocol was
performed, and cell viability was calculated.

Materials
Fmoc-amino acids and resins in this study were
purchased from GL Biochem Ltd. (Shanghai; HPLCpurified; purity > 99%, identified by mass spectra).
Paclitaxel was obtained from Demochem Co (Shanghai,
China). All other chemicals were obtained from SigmaAldrich unless otherwise noted. The human recombinant
MMP2 was purchased from Biomol International, Inc
(Plymouth, PA).

Scratch assay
The special function of MMP2 in cancer metastasis
suggests that halt of MMPs activity is capable to cease the
tumor cell metastasis. In this study, scratch assays were
conducted in order to investigate whether the conjugate
is able to inhibit the metastasis, given the increased
paclitaxel concentration surrounding the tumour cells
upon proteolysis by MMP2 specifically.
The HT-1080, U87MG, Hep G2 and Hep-2 cells
were seeded in 6-well plates and cultured overnight.
Following scraping of the cell layers in a straight line
by a sterile p200 pipette tip, the debris was removed in
two gentle rinses with PBS. Subsequently, 2.5 ml cell
culture containing either free paclitaxel or conjuagte
(final concentration at 5 mg/ml for paclitaxel) was plated.
After 24 hours in a cell incubator, the distances between
the two edges of the scratched cells were observed using
Leica ICC50 HD microscopy (LEICA Microsystems
Ltd, Switzerland). The apparent rate of inhibition was
calculated using the following formula: inhibition rate (IR)
= [(Distancetreated, 24 h - Distancetreated, 0 h) - (Distancecontrol, 24 h Distancecontrol, 0 h)]/Distancetreated, 0 h × 100.

Cell culture
The HT-1080, Hep G2 and MCF-7 cells were
cultured in DMEM (Gibco by Invitrogen, California,
USA) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Gibco
by Invitrogen, California, USA). The U87MG cells
were cultured in MEM (Gibco by Invitrogen, Carlsbad,
California, USA) and RPMI-1640 (Gibco by Invitrogen,
Carlsbad, California, USA) supplemented with 10% fetal
bovine serum (Gibco by Invitrogen, California, USA).
All cell lines were cultured at 37°C in an atmosphere of
5% CO2. 

Synthesis of peptide (Fmoc-PVGLIG) and
conjugate
The peptide was synthesized by solid-phase
synthesis using a CEM Liberty 1 peptide synthesizer. The
synthesized peptide was purified by reverse phase HPLC
equipped with a C18 column (XBridge, 5 mm particle size,
10 × 100 mm; Waters, USA). The purified sample was
evaluated by mass spectrometry. In brief, 12.5 mg EDCI
(66.1 mmol) and 8.8 mg HOBt (66.1 mmol) were titrated
into a paclitaxel solution (56.5 mg, 66.1 mmol) followed
by the addition of 2 mg DMAP after 15 minutes of stirring
under nitrogen atmosphere at ambient temperature. After
another 5 minutes of stirring, the peptide (77.5 mg,
99.7 mmol) was added and then stirred for 24 hours.
The reaction mixture was dried under reduced pressure
following piperidine treatment for the removal of Fmoc
group. RP-HPLC using an XBridge C18 silica column
(5 mm particle size, 10 × 100 mm; Waters, USA) was
employed to purify the peptide-drug conjugate using
acetonitrile:water as the mobile phase. A linear gradient
was applied; 0 min, 10% acetonitrile; 30 min, 90%
acetonitrile at 214 nm; the elution was collected and
analysed.

Drug release study upon MMP2 proteolysis
To determine whether the specific MMP2
proteolysis induced the release of paclitaxel or not, HPLCMS was employed to monitor the conjugate dissociation
at the presence of the MMP2. Free paclitaxel (100 mg)
or conjugate (paclitaxel amount is 100 mg) solution was
prepared in PBS buffer, pH 7.0, containing 100 mM
ZnSO4 in various concentrations, following MMP2 (5 mg)
titration. The release of free paclitaxel in the mixture at
different time points (2 h, 4 h, 8 h, 12 h and 24 h) was
monitored by RP-HPLC. A similar assay was also
performed in cancer cell lines over-expressing MMP2 and
in cancer cell lines without MMP2 expression.

the spray voltage at 4.5 kV. Nitrogen was used as the
sheath and auxiliary gas and set at 90 lb/square inch and
25 arbitrary units, respectively. The argon collision gas
pressure was set to 2.5 mTorr. The samples (50 ml) were
chromatographed at ambient temperature on the Oasis
HLB column. Solvent A was acetonitrile, and Solvent B
was 5 mM sodium trifluoroacetate in 0.1% aqueous formic
acid. The analyses were chromatographed with a 0.8 ml/
min flow rate with the following linear gradient: 0 min,
5% A; 0.5 min, 5% A; 5.5 min, 82% A. The gradient was
followed by a 1.0 ml/min rinse for 1.0 min with 100%
methanol and 30 s with 95% acetonitrile and by column
re-equilibration to the initial conditions. The flow was
diverted to the mass spectrometer for quantitative analysis.

ConclusionS

Six-week-old male BALB/c nude mice were
obtained from Shanghai Laboratory Animal Co., China
Academy of Sciences (Shanghai, China). Mice (weighing
16–20 mg) were housed in barrier facilities on a 12 h light/
dark cycle. Food and water were supplied ad libitum.
On day zero, two groups of mice were inoculated via
i.p. injection with HT-1080 and U-87MG tumour cells
(2 × 105) in 0.5 ml of RPMI1640. Treatment was initiated
after the tumour was allowed to grow to approximately
100 mm3 on the back of the mouse. This experimental
protocol is intended to mimic the clinical situation when

Paclitaxel is a widely used chemotherapeutic agent
in the clinical treatment of various solid tumor including
ovarian, breast, non-small cell lung, head and neck
cancers. However, the off-target toxicity of paclitaxel
restricted its clinical utility.
In this study, paclitaxel was successfully conjugated
with a hexapeptide which is recognized by MMP2
specifically, the interaction of hexapeptide and MMP2
enzymatic pocket showed in Figure 5. Consequently,
MMP2 enzymatically hydrolysed the hexapeptide and
