BACKGROUND: The treatment of patients with advanced or recurrent endometrial cancer remains problematic,
because chemotherapy and hormonal therapy have yielded low response rates and limited progression-free survival.
Because the combination of gemcitabine and cisplatin demonstrated synergism in preclinical studies, the authors
attempted to determine the efficacy and toxicity of this combination in women with advanced or recurrent endometrial cancer. METHODS: A prospective, single-institution, phase 2 study was performed in women with histologically
documented International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) stage III or IV or recurrent endometrioid
endometrial carcinoma. Gemcitabine at a dose of 1000 mg/m2 and cisplatin at a dose of 35 mg/m2 were administered intravenously on Days 1 and 8 of each 21-day cycle; because of myelosuppression, the protocol was revised to
gemcitabine at a dose of 900 mg/m2 and cisplatin at a dose of 30 mg/m2. Patients were treated until disease
progression, unacceptable toxicity, or complete response. RESULTS: A total of 21 patients were enrolled and received
a median of 5 courses of therapy (range, 1-9 courses). The median age at the time of study enrollment was 62 years
(range, 41-75 years). Of 20 evaluable patients, 2 (10%) had a confirmed complete response, 8 (40%) had a partial
response, 6 (30%) had stable disease, and 4 (20%) developed progressive disease. The median progression-free
survival was 7.5 months (range, 2.3-33.6 months), and the median overall survival was 18.2 months (range, 2.5-49.4
months). The development of toxicity mandated dose reductions in 16 of 20 patients (80%). Eighteen patients
experienced grade 3 or 4 toxic effects (graded according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events
[version 3.0]). CONCLUSIONS: The objective response rate of 50% noted with gemcitabine and cisplatin combination
chemotherapy merits the further development of this regimen in women with advanced or recurrent endometrial

Endometrial cancer is the most common gynecologic malignancy and the fourth most common cancer among

women in the United States, with 42,160 new cases and 7780 deaths estimated for 2009.1 Although most patients present
with early stage disease that is amenable to treatment, patients with advanced (stage III or IV, according to the newly
revised system by the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics [FIGO]) or recurrent endometrial cancer
have few therapeutic options. Radiotherapy, chemotherapy, and hormonal therapy have demonstrated only limited
success,2-20 and with the exception of platinum-based drugs, doxorubicin, and paclitaxel, most single agents have shown
little or insignificant clinical activity.4-7
Responses for single-agent cisplatin as primary therapy are reported to be approximately 20%. However, its activity
in subsequent lines of therapy is much lower.8,9 Likewise, response rates for single-agent carboplatin, doxorubicin, and

paclitaxel range from 17% to 37%.10-15 Although
response rates are generally higher for these agents when
used in combination (range, 30%-49%),12,13,16-18 toxicity is higher and the median progression-free survival
(PFS) and overall survival (OS) times remain short. The
regimen of paclitaxel, doxorubicin, and cisplatin has
demonstrated significant activity in patients with
advanced or recurrent endometrial cancer.16 When combined, paclitaxel and carboplatin also appear to have activity in these patients, with response rates reported to be as
high as 67%.19 A comparison trial of these 2 regimens is
currently underway in the Gynecologic Oncology Group.
These modest response rates combined with a median PFS of only 2 to 4 months warrant the continued
search for agents for use alone or in combination that
could improve the outcome of patients with advanced or
recurrent endometrial cancer.2-19 The combination of
gemcitabine and cisplatin has a definite biologic rationale,
because the synergism of these 2 agents measured by cytotoxic activity has been confirmed in human ovarian carcinoma, colon cancer, lung cancer, and squamous cell head
and neck cancer cell lines.20-24 Smith et al demonstrated
that gemcitabine and cisplatin have significant in vitro
activity in multiple endometrial cancer cell lines, with the
combination reported to be markedly synergistic compared with either agent alone.25 It is interesting to note
that the combination of gemcitabine plus cisplatin was
reported to have greater cytotoxic activity than the
combination of gemcitabine plus carboplatin.25 Furthermore, the combination of gemcitabine and cisplatin has
previously been used safely in other cancers,26-32 and
preclinical data have demonstrated synergism in both
platinum-sensitive and platinum-resistant endometrial
cancer cell lines.25 Clinical data suggest that gemcitabine
can reverse platinum resistance in patients with ovarian
and peritoneal cancers,33 and the mechanism of gemcitabine modulation of platinum resistance has been determined to occur predominantly through down-regulation
of the glutathione S-transferase (GST-1)/glutathione
pathway.34 These data support gemcitabine’s reversal of
platinum resistance in endometrial cancer and provide the
rationale for combining gemcitabine and cisplatin in the
treatment of patients with endometrial carcinoma.
Thus, the current study was designed to evaluate the
antitumor activity of a combination of gemcitabine and
cisplatin in patients with advanced or recurrent endometrial cancer and to determine the nature and degree of the
toxicity of this combination in this cohort of patients.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Eligibility
This study was conducted with Institutional Review
Board approval. Eligible patients had histologically documented primary FIGO stage III or IV or recurrent (any
stage) endometrioid endometrial carcinoma based on the
1988 FIGO staging system, and were unlikely to be cured
by surgery and/or radiotherapy. Patients with recurrent
disease were required to have pathologic confirmation,
and all patients were to have measurable disease, which was
defined as at least 1 lesion that could be accurately measured
in at least 1 dimension (longest dimension [LD]) at the time
of enrollment. At least 1 lesion must have been 20 mm
when measured by conventional techniques, including palpation, plain x-ray, or magnetic resonance imaging, or at
least double the slice thickness of helical computed tomography (4 mm-8 mm), with the thickness used for the baseline
examination duplicated at follow-up examinations.
Patients may have received an unlimited number of
prior chemotherapy agents, including platinum-based
therapy, but therapy must have been discontinued 3
weeks before study enrollment. Initially, patients who had
previously received cisplatin were excluded from study
participation, but once the basis for gemcitabine reversal
of platinum resistance was elucidated, the protocol was
modified to include them. Prior radiotherapy was
allowed, but 2 weeks must have elapsed from its
completion, and 6 weeks must have elapsed if radiotherapy involved the whole pelvis or >50% of the spine. Hormonal therapy may have been discontinued at any time
before enrollment. Preconditions for initiating protocol
therapy included the following values: platelet count
100,000/lL, an absolute neutrophil count (ANC)
1500/uL, serum creatinine 1.5 mg/dL (non-isotope
dilution mass spectrometry [IDMS]), serum glutamic
pyruvic transaminase 3 times the institutional upper
limit of normal, and total bilirubin 1.5 times the institutional upper limit of normal. Neuropathy (sensory and
motor) was required to be grade 1 according to the
Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events
(CTCAE) (version 3.0). Patients must have had a Zubrod
performance status of 0, 1, or 2. Patients must have recovered from the effects of recent surgery or radiotherapy and
were required to be free of significant infection.
Women were not eligible for study participation if
they had previously received gemcitabine; had a concomitant malignancy other than nonmelanoma skin cancer or
a prior malignancy other than endometrial carcinoma

within the last 5 years; had serous or clear cell carcinoma
or malignant mixed mullerian tumor of the uterus; had a

bine and 5 mg/m2 of cisplatin. The use of erythropoietinstimulating agents was allowed for grade 2 anemia.
Patients were treated until their disease progressed, toxicity was unacceptable, or complete response (CR) was
confirmed by repeat imaging 4 weeks after a documented CR.

Treatment Plan
Chemotherapy was administered in an outpatient setting.
On Days 1 and 8, patients received prehydration with 1 L
of normal saline (NS) with 20 milliequivalents (mEq) of
potassium chloride and 16 mEq of magnesium sulfate
intravenously (iv) over 2 hours (at 500 mL/hour) and iv
antiemetic and dexamethasone, followed by iv gemcitabine (at a dose of 1000 mg/m2 in 250 mL of NS over
1 hour) and cisplatin (at a dose of 35 mg/m2 in 500 mL
1/2 NS over 1 hour). Because myelosuppression necessitated dose reductions in the first 6 patients treated on the
protocol, the dose was reduced to 900 mg/m2 of gemcitabine and 30 mg/m2 of cisplatin. To receive therapy on
Day 8, patients must have had an ANC of 1000 cells/
mm3 and a platelet count of 75,000 cells/mm3; if these
levels were not met, the Day 8 infusion in that cycle was
eliminated. This cycle was repeated at 21-day intervals,
pending resolution of toxic effects. Weekly delays in
therapy were prescribed for specific patients to allow for
such resolution. However, patients with delays >2 weeks
were removed from study. Three weeks of therapy (2 weeks
of treatment and 1 week of rest) were considered as 1 course.

Response
Patients who received 1 course(s) of chemotherapy and
survived 4 weeks were considered evaluable for
response. Patients who received 1 course(s) of chemotherapy were considered evaluable for toxicity regardless
of the length of survival.
Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors
(RECIST) criteria were used to assess response. Briefly, a
CR was defined as the disappearance of all target and
nontarget lesions and the absence of new lesions, as documented by 2 disease assessments 4 weeks apart (documentation of CR with subsequent confirmation). A
partial response (PR) was defined as a 30% decrease in
the sum of the LDs of all measurable target lesions (using
the baseline sum of the LDs as the reference) and the
absence of the progression of nontarget lesions or the
development of new lesions, as documented by 2 disease
assessments 4 weeks apart. When the only target lesion
was a solitary pelvic mass measurable by physical examination but not radiography, a 50% decrease in the LD was
required for the patient to be considered to have achieved
a PR. Progressive disease (PD) was defined as a 20%
increase in the sum of the LDs of target lesions (using as the
reference the smallest sum of the LDs at any assessment) or
the appearance of new lesions within 9 weeks of study entry.
Unequivocal progression of existing nontarget lesions, other
than pleural effusions without cytological proof of neoplastic
origin, within 9 weeks of enrollment was also considered
PD. Responses required confirmation by imaging after an at
least 4-week interval. Stable disease was defined as any condition not meeting the above criteria for CR, PR, or PD. PFS
was measured from the time of enrollment until PD, and
OS was measured from the time of enrollment until death or
the date of last contact.

Assessment and Management of Toxicity
This study used the CTCAE (version 3.0) for defining
and grading specific adverse events. Dose reductions of
100 mg/m2 of gemcitabine and 5 mg/m2 of cisplatin were
required on Days 1 and 8 of each subsequent treatment
cycle for febrile neutropenia or grade 4 neutropenia
lasting 7 days; grade 4 thrombocytopenia; grade 2
peripheral neuropathy or renal dysfunction; grade 3
hepatic dysfunction, nausea, or vomiting; or other grade
2 nonhematologic toxicities, with a maximum of 2 reductions. A delay of up to 2 weeks was permitted for the resolution of toxicities to grade 1; if resolution was not
reached, the patient was removed from the study. Patients
were also removed for grade 2 gemcitabine-related
pneumonitis. Patients who had recurrent neutropenia
after treatment modifications were allowed prophylactic
granulocyte–colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF); subsequent recurrent grade 4 neutropenia required a second
dose reduction by an additional 100 mg/m2 of gemcita-

Study Design
This study was designed to estimate the activity of a
combination of gemcitabine and cisplatin and to evaluate
its toxicity in patients with measurable advanced or recurrent endometrial carcinoma. The objective response rate
(CR and PR) was the primary endpoint. A target objective
response rate of 20% was assigned, with a projected

4975

Original Article

accrual of a minimum of 10 patients and a maximum of
20 patients. A Bayesian stopping rule was used to monitor
the objective response rate during the trial. This rule
assumed a uniform prior distribution for the objective
response rate, which had a mean of 50% and a standard
deviation of 29%. The data from the trial were then used
sequentially to augment this prior distribution to calculate
the posterior probability that the objective response rate
was 20%. The trial would be stopped early if there was a
<10% chance that the objective response rate was 20%.
This regimen would be considered active if an objective
response were noted in 7 of the 20 patients (35%), yielding a 90% credible interval for an objective response rate
of 20.6% to 53.6%. Responses were sufficient to keep the
trial open without stopping enrollment. We estimated the
objective response rate with a 90% credible interval, and
we report the posterior probability that the objective
response rate was 20%.

RESULTS
Twenty-one patients were entered on this trial between
November 2004 and September 2009. One patient was
not evaluable for response or toxicity after transitioning to
comfort care without completing the first treatment cycle.
Patient characteristics are listed in Table 1. The median
age of the treated patients was 62 years (range, 4175 years). Of the 21 enrolled patients, 8 (38%) had
received prior radiotherapy alone, 3 (14%) had received
prior chemotherapy alone (1 patient was not evaluable), 6
(29%) had received prior radiotherapy and chemotherapy, and 4 (19%) had received neither radiotherapy
nor chemotherapy. The median number of treatment
courses administered to each patient during the study was
5 (range, 1-9 courses).
Of the 20 evaluable patients, 2 (10%) had a CR, 8
(40%) had a PR, 6 (30%) had stable disease, and 4 (20%)
had PD. The overall objective response rate was 50%. The
90% credible interval for the objective response rate was
32.8% to 67.2%. The posterior probability that the objective response rate was 20% was 99.9%. The median
PFS for all evaluable patients was 7.5 months (range, 2.333.6 months), and the median duration of response
among responders was 8.1 months (range, 5.7-14.0
months). In the 2 patients achieving a CR, the durations
of response were 33.6 months and 16.5 months, respectively, and both remained without evidence of disease at
the time of last follow-up. The median OS for all evaluable patients was 18.2 months (range, 2.5-49.4 months).

Figure 1 shows the PFS and OS for all patients. At the
time of last follow-up, 4 patients (20%) had no evidence
of disease, 4 patients (20%) were alive with disease, and
12 patients (60%) had died of disease.
Response rates appeared lower in patients who had
received prior therapy, but these changes did not reach
statistical significance. Eight of 12 patients (67%) who
had received no prior chemotherapy responded, compared with 2 of 8 patients (25%) who had received prior
chemotherapy (P ¼ .17, Fisher exact test). Similarly, 5 of
6 patients who had received no prior radiotherapy
responded, compared with 5 of 14 patients who had
received prior radiotherapy (P ¼ .14, Fisher exact test).
All 4 patients who were radiotherapy-naive and chemotherapy-naive responded to treatment. At the initial
dosing regimen of gemcitabine (1000 mg/m2) and cisplatin (35 mg/m2), all 6 patients required at least 1 dose
reduction because of toxicity. Three of the 6 patients had
received prior radiotherapy alone and 1 had received prior

radiotherapy and chemotherapy. After the protocol was
modified to lower starting doses of gemcitabine (900 mg/
m2) and cisplatin (30 mg/m2), 10 of 14 subsequent patients
required dose reductions because of toxicity. Of these
10 patients, 3 had received prior radiotherapy alone, 2 had
received prior chemotherapy alone, and 4 had received prior
radiotherapy and chemotherapy. In total, 16 of the 20
evaluable patients (80%) required dose reductions during
the study. In addition, 7 of the 20 patients (35%) required
G-CSF despite a level 1 dose reduction. Of the total of
112 cycles administered during the study, the Day 8 dose
was omitted in 12 cycles because of myelosuppression. In
total, 11 patients missed the Day 8 dose (10 patients in a
single cycle and 1 patient in 2 separate cycles).
Toxic effects, by grade, are listed in Table 2. Of the
20 evaluable patients, 11 had grade 3 or 4 neutropenia, 10
had grade 3 or 4 thrombocytopenia, and 7 had grade 3
anemia. Fourteen patients experienced a grade 3 or 4 nonhematologic toxicity. All patients had multiple toxicities.
The most common grade 3 or 4 adverse events included
hypokalemia (4 patients), fatigue (4 patients), and hyperglycemia (3 patients). In addition, 2 patients experienced
renal insufficiency, 1 patient had a pulmonary embolism,
and 1 patient required hospital admission for hematuria
related to thrombocytopenia. Despite this toxicity profile,
11 patients went on to receive subsequent myelosuppressive therapy, including chemotherapy with or without
targeted therapy in 7 patients and chemotherapy and
radiotherapy in 4 patients.

median duration of response of 8.1 months. These findings are well above the threshold for defining an active

agent, which was set in the current study as a response rate
of 20%, and suggest that the combination of gemcitabine
and cisplatin is among the most active of regimens
commercially available for women with advanced or
recurrent endometrial cancer.
The importance of these results is evident when considering the response rate and survival results observed
with the other active combination regimens for endometrial cancer. The combination of paclitaxel, doxorubicin,
and cisplatin has yielded a response rate of 57% and a
median OS of 32 months, but with substantial neurotoxicity and several treatment-related deaths reported.16
The regimen of paclitaxel and carboplatin has resulted
in a response rate of 67%, with 1-year and 3-year survival
rates of 82% and 33%, respectively.19 This new combination regimen of gemcitabine and cisplatin yields
comparable results and provides a viable treatment option
for patients with advanced or recurrent endometrial cancer.
Patients who had received no prior therapy appeared
to respond better than patients who had received either
radiotherapy or chemotherapy before study enrollment.
The sample size in the current study was too small to
achieve statistically meaningful comparisons between proportions, but the trend was noted. Future studies with
larger sample sizes may define the effects of prior therapy
on response in this patient population.
The hematologic toxicity reported in the current
study partially reflects the heavily pretreated patient
population. As noted, only 4 patients (19%) were chemotherapy- and radiotherapy-naive. The initial doses used
resulted in significant hematologic toxicity requiring
multiple dose reductions; therefore, the starting doses
were reduced to gemcitabine at a dose of 900 mg/m2 and
cisplatin at a dose of 30 mg/m2. The modified doses
appeared to be better tolerated in this pretreated population with compromised bone marrow function. However,
because 80% of patients in the current study required
dose reductions, including 10 of 14 patients who initiated
treatment at the modified dosage, and 35% of patients
required G-CSF after dose reduction for hematologic toxicity, lower the starting doses might be advisable when
using this regimen (eg, gemcitabine at a dose of 800 mg/
m2 and cisplatin at a dose of 25 mg/m2). This gemcitabine
dose is consistent with that used in treating patients with
recurrent ovarian cancer. Starting at a further dose reduction for radiation-exposed patients and prospectively
using G-CSF during the first cycle of therapy may help to
minimize toxicity and resultant treatment delays. An
alternate dosing regimen of gemcitabine and cisplatin on

4978

a biweekly schedule, as reported in patients with ovarian
cancer, represents another option.35
One potential advantage of this combination regimen is the limited nonhematologic toxicity: alopecia is
infrequent, other nonhematologic toxicities do not appear
to be debilitating, and hematologic toxicities can largely
be overcome by dose reduction and the use of growth
factors. For patients receiving chemotherapy for the palliation of advanced endometrial cancer, such factors associated with quality of life may be important to consider.
We believe that cisplatin is preferable to carboplatin
in combination with gemcitabine. Although gemcitabine
and carboplatin have been administered safely in combination and have been found to have activity in other
tumors,36-38 the combination of gemcitabine and cisplatin has been found to be more effective than gemcitabine and carboplatin in endometrial cancer cell lines.25
Although single institution studies tend to demonstrate higher response rates than multi-institutional trials,
these response data warrant further development of the
combination regimen of gemcitabine and cisplatin. A
novel direction of investigation for this doublet would
include combination with bevacizumab or another
biologic agent. In patients with advanced or recurrent
endometrioid endometrial carcinoma, gemcitabine and
cisplatin appear to be highly active with manageable toxicity and should be investigated in a larger, definitive trial.
