ABSTRACT:
5-Fluorouracil (5FU) and similar fluoropyrimidines induce covalent modification
of thymidylate synthase (TS) and inhibit its activity. They are often used to treat
solid cancers, but drug resistance and toxicity are drawbacks. Therefore, there is an
unmet need for a functional assay to quantify fluorouracil activity in tissues, so as to
individually tailor dosing. It is cumbersome to separately quantify unmodified and
5FU-modified TS using currently available commercial anti-TS antibodies because they
recognize both forms. We report here the first monoclonal antibody (FTS) specific
to 5FU-modified TS. By immunoblot assay, the FTS antibody specifically recognizes
modified TS in a dose-dependent manner in 5FU-treated cells, in cancer xenograft
tissues of 5FU-treated mice, and in the murine tissues. In the same assay, the
antibody is nonreactive with unmodified TS in untreated or treated cells and tissues.
Speculatively, a high-throughput assay could be enabled by pairing anti-TS antibodies
of two specificities, one recognizing only modified TS and another recognizing both
forms, to structurally quantify the TS-inhibiting effect of fluorouracil at a cellular or
tissue level without requiring prior protein separation. Such a development might
aid preclinical analytic studies or make practical the individual tailoring of dosing.

INTRODUCTION

and covalent bonds of the methylene group to both C-5
of FdUMP and N-5 of folate. Graded inhibition of TS
results in degrees of inhibition of DNA synthesis. FdUTP
can, in place of dTTP, incorporate into DNA and result in
DNA damage directly by mis-incorporation or indirectly
by stimulating DNA repair [4-6]. FUTP, in place of UTP,
incorporates into, and damages or impairs function of,
RNA [7-9].
Fluoropyrimidines are an essential component of
colorectal cancer chemotherapy [10], are also used to
treat other gastrointestinal cancers, breast cancer, and head
and neck cancers, and are often included in combination
chemotherapeutic regimens. Despite large numbers of
5FU-related clinical studies [11], there has been a little
done to individually tailor fluoropyrimidine dosage for
cancer therapy. The separate quantification of native
unmodified TS (TS-N) and TS-F after treatment could be
used to optimize dosing and tumor responses. Drake et.al,
used immunoblots (IB) to quantify total TS and TS-F [12].
Quantification of total TS, TS-N and TS-F was also done

TS catalyses the reductive methylation of
2-deoxyuridine-5-monophosphate
(dUMP)
to
2-deoxythymidine-5-monophosphate (dTMP) with
provision of a carbon donated by 5, 10-methylene
tetrahydrofolate (DMTHF) [1, 2]. dTMP is then converted
to dTTP for use in DNA synthesis. As a necessary
component of DNA replication, TS is an attractive target
for cancer treatment.
The anti-metabolite drug 5FU, a fluoropyrimidine,
and fluoropyrimidine analogues are used to inhibit
TS in cancer treatment [3]. Intracellularly, 5FU is
converted to active metabolites fluorodeoxyuridine
(FdUMP), fluorodeoxyuridine triphosphate (FdUTP), and
fluorouridine triphosphate (FUTP). FdUMP competes
with dUMP and, covalently with DMTHF, binds TS to
form a ternary complex (5FU-modified TS, TS-F) [1],
terminating its activity. The ternary complex consists of a
covalent bond between Cys198 of TS and C-6 of FdUMP

using radiochemicals [13-15]. These methods are tedious
at best, however.
To work toward a more facile quantification, we
developed a monoclonal antibody by using TS-F as the
immunizing antigen. By IB, the antibody specifically
recognized TS-F from 5FU-treated cell lysates and
from 5FU-treated cancer xenograft tissues. A plausible
moderate-term future goal would be to quantify separately
TS-N and TS-F in tissues by developing an assay that
used a nonspecific anti-TS antibody and a specific antiTS-F antibody, so as to permit clinical monitoring of
fluoropyrimidine cellular activity, expressed as measured
ratio of TS-F to the remaining TS-N.

of RKO cells transfected so as to express 3xFlag-tagged
TS. After these confirmations, the purified rTS-F was used
to immunize animals for antibody generation.

Development of monoclonal antibody
We screened more than 60 hybridoma clones from
mouse immunizations, but all murine clones failed to
recognize rTS-F specifically. Because the chemical
structures of folic acid, THF, and DMTHF are similar, and
because many commercial antibodies to forms of folic
acid are available, we reasoned that these antibodies might
cross-react with DMTHF, which is an adduct of, and thus
present in, TS-F. Immunoblotting, using various anti-FA
antibodies, however failed to detect the TS-F present in
5FU-treated RKO cells (Data not shown). We continued
our efforts by immunizing rats with rTS-F. From 16
rat hybridoma clones, one (FTS, rat IgG1) specifically
recognized rTS-F in ELISA. We selected the FTS clone
for expression and antibody purification.

RESULTS
Verifying the method of TS modification in vitro
It is known that cellular TS-F migrates slower than
TS-N in denaturing protein gels, by IB [16]. By IB using
anti-TS antibody (TS106), we also observed cellular TS-F
migrating slower than TS-N in the in vitro-modified RKO
cell lysate (Figure 1A). Results were compared with a
lysate of 5FU-treated RKO cells, in which TS-F migrates
slower than TS-N.
We produced rTS and modified it in vitro to form
rTS-F. In Coomassie-stained denaturing protein gels,
we observed rTS-F migrating slower than un-modified
rTS (rTS-N) (Figure 1B). This verified our in vitromodification of rTS to rTS-F. We also observed in vitro
modified rGST-TS-F migrating slower than unmodified
rGST-TS.
By IB using TS106, we observed slower migration of
rTS-F than rTS-N and, similarly, of rGST-TS-F than rGSTTS (Figure 1C). In an additional control, we observed the
presence of in vitro-modified 3XFlag-tagged TS in a lysate

Characterization of new monoclonal antibody
FTS
By IB, monoclonal antibody (moAb) FTS reacted
with rTS-F and not with rTS-N (Figure 2A). A commercial
TS106 antibody recognized both rTS-F and rTS-N. FTS
immunoreacted with TS-F from 5FU-treated RKO cells
and did not detect TS-N in un-treated cells (Figure 2A).
TS106 detected both forms of TS in RKO cells.
Phosphatase treatments of 5FU-treated RKO
cell lysate and rTS-F. CIP treatment of the lysate of
5FU-treated RKO cells abrogated the migration shift
characteristic of TS-F (Figure 3A), a shift demonstrable
using commercial anti-TS antibodies [17]. There was a
possibility that the covalent modification might remain
essentially intact after removal of the phosphate from

FdUMP, despite the conversion to a more rapid migration
speed. If this were the case, then one should perhaps
detect the faster migration of TS-F, when using moAb
FTS. Upon CIP treatment of lysates of 5FU-treated RKO
cells and of purified rTS-F, however, FTS did not detect a
faster migration of TS-F; rather, immunodetectable TS-F
merely decreased (Figure 2B). This observation confirms
the suggestion of Brody et. al, that TS-F may be unstable
after phosphatase treatment. The phosphate of FdUMP is
known to be ligated by four arginine residues and a serine
residue in the ternary complex. Removing the phosphate
might de-stabilize the ternary complex, perhaps driving
the reverse reaction.
Trypsin and endoproteinase AspN digestions of
rTS and rTS-F. Because phosphatase treatment rendered
the TS modification unstable, we wondered whether TS
modification were stable after proteolytic digestion. We
digested rTS and rTS-F using trypsin and AspN. By IB,
moAb FTS detected trimmed fragments of rTS-F (Figure
2C) after digestion with trypsin and AspN, suggesting
retention of the modification in partially digested rTS-F.
FTS detected in AspN digestion fragments smaller than
in trypsin digestion, perhaps due to the relative resistance
of rTS-F to trypsin digestion, which was described by
Galivan et. al [18].

both forms of TS. MoAb FTS detected only TS-F in 5FUtreated cells. The intensity of the FTS immunoreactivity to
TS-F was comparable to that of the rabbit anti-TS to TS-F.
Thus, 5FU activity in cell culture was reflected in both a
dose-response relationship and a time-dependence.
Competitions using 5FU, FUDR, and MTX. Using
the rabbit anti-TS, TS-F was detected by IB after 5FU
and FUDR treatments. The addition of methotrexate
during treatment abrogated detection of TS-F in 5FUtreated cells and in FUDR-treated cells, by IB using
the same antibody, as was shown previously [17] using
TS106. The FTS antibody did not detect TS-F in the
5FU+MTX-treated samples and reacted at low intensity
in FUDR+MTX-treated samples (Figure 3B). This result
confirmed the known interference affecting the 5FU or
FUDR modifications of TS caused by MTX [17, 19].

5-FU functional monitoring in vivo
Xenograft tissues. Given our proposed eventual goal
of monitoring the activity of 5FU in dosed patients, we
next sought to translate the demonstration to an in vivo
setting. We injected athymic nude mice with RKO and
MiaPaCa2 cells to develop xenograft tumors. We treated
tumor-bearing mice with various doses of 5FU, harvesting
tumors at one hour. By IB analysis of the tumors, we
observed findings similar to those of in vitro treatments.
Differences in 5FU activity were seen between the cancer
lines tested. As observed in cell culture, TS-F formation
in vivo was seen with lower 5FU doses in RKO than in
MiaPaCa2 xenografts (Figure 4). Higher 5FU doses drove
fractionally more TS conversion to the inactive TS-F form
in both tumor types. The rabbit anti-TS antibody detected
both forms of TS, seen as a higher TS-F:TS-N ratio with
use of higher 5FU doses. MoAb FTS detected only TSF, seen as increasing TS-F reactivity with higher 5FU
doses. Thus, 5FU activity was reflected in quantitative
differences paralleling a dose-response relationship and an
intrinsic difference between tumors from different origins.

5FU functional monitoring in vitro using moAb
FTS
Dose-response and time-dependent effects. We
treated RKO and MiaPaCa2 cells with different doses
(concentrations) of 5FU for 1h or 24h. By IB, RKO and
MiaPaCa2 cells differed in the proportions of TS present
in the TS-F form (Figure 3A). RKO cells formed TS-F
at a lower dose of 5FU than did MiaPaCa2 cells. The
ratio of TS-F to TS-N increased from 1h treatment to 24h
treatment, as seen at the lower dose range in both cell lines.
Higher 5FU doses caused more TS to be present as TS-F
in both cell lines. The commercial rabbit anti-TS detected

DISCUSSION

Mouse tissue and cells. From the xenograft
experiments, we also harvested kidneys. TS is expected
only in proliferating cells, and thus the detectable renal
TS protein levels were lower than in the tumors (Figure
4). TS-F was present in kidney tissues at one hour posttreatment. FTS detected TS-F in 5FU-treated animals
only. The rabbit anti-TS reacted with both TS-N and
TS-F of murine kidney. The level of TS-F, and the ratio
of TS-F to TS-N, were both dose-dependent. These results
were replicated in an independent xenograft-treatment
experiment. Separately, in 5FU-treated CT38 murine cells
in culture, FTS detected TS-F alone while the rabbit antiTS reacted with both TS-N and TS-F (Data not shown).

A new rat monoclonal antibody, FTS, recognizes
TS-F in 5FU-treated cells and tissues of human and mice.
Using FTS in immunoblot assays, we observed dosedependent responses of 5FU in cell lines and tissues. A
progression of the 5FU effect was observed over the time
elapsed, subsequent to dosing from 1h to 24h, RKO cells
being more sensitive than MiaPaCa2 cells. Additional
observations further supported the phosphate group
being required for stabilization of the ternary-complex,
as suggested by Brody et. al [17]. FTS detected smaller
products of rTS-F after proteolytic digestion.

Although 5FU metabolites target TS, RNA, and
DNA, we speculate that an immunoassay using paired
and differing antibody specificities to TS might permit
functional monitoring of the effectiveness of a dose of
5FU or response to 5FU in the clinic, obtaining samples
by biopsy or at the time of tumor resection. Quantification
based on IB, however, is tedious, requiring significant
sample mass, multiple-step processing, and time. Johnston
et. al used a chemiluminescence ELISA, for example, to
quantify native TS in tissues using TS106 [20]. A further
development, using two antibodies, one specific to TS
and second specific to TS-F, might permit a liquid-based
assay or other rapid automated assay to be developed for
small sample size. Using the separate quantification of TS
and TS-F, it would be possible to calculate a TS-F:TS-N
ratio as a cumulative measure of 5FU intracellular effect
over time. The FTS antibody may also aid biological
experimentations of the 5FU modification of TS in vivo
and in vitro, and aid comparisons of pharmacologic
analogues such as 5FU, capecitabine, FdUR, and FUR.

Cloning
Total RNA was isolated from RKO cells using
RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen). cDNA was synthesized
from total RNA using Superscript III cDNA synthesis
kit (Invitrogen) as per manufacturerâs instructions. From
cDNA, the TS gene coding sequence was amplified by
PCR using primers TYMS-F:5â-GTGGTGGAATTCTAT

final concentrations of 1mg/ml, 50Âµg/ml, and 50Âµg/ml,
respectively. To lyse bacteria, TritonX was added to a
final concentration of 1% and the mixture vortexed and
freeze-thawed thrice using liquid nitrogen. The lysate was
clarified by centrifugation at 14000g for 15min. NaCl was
added to the supernatant to achieve a final concentration of
0.5M, mixed well by pipetting. To isolate GST-tagged TS,
glutathione sepharose 4B was added and rotated end-overend at room temperature (RT) for 2h. The bound rGST-TS
slurry was washed three times with buffer A. Recombinant
GST-TS was eluted by incubating the slurry with 10mM
reduced glutathione in 50mM Tris-HCl. Alternately, to
elute recombinant GST-free TS (rTS), we incubated the
slurry with bovine thrombin and phosphate-buffered saline
(PBS) for 18hr at RT, pelleted the beads, and recovered
rTS in the supernatant. We quantified protein using the DC
protein assay (Bio-Rad).

supernatant was retained for protein studies.
In a separate experiment, RKO cells were treated
with 5FU or FUDR (each at 10ÂµM final concentration),
with or without methotrexate (25ÂµM final concentration).
After 24h treatment, cells were processed as above.

Phosphatase treatment
50Âµg of 5FU-treated RKO cell lysate protein was
treated with 50u of CIP for 1h at 37ÂºC. 50ng of rTS-F
was treated with 2.5u of CIP for 1h at 37ÂºC. At the end of
incubation, SDS loading buffer was added and samples
heated at 100ÂºC for 5min.

Proteolytic digestion
10Âµg of rTS or rTS-F was digested with trypsin or
AspN as 20:1 protein:enzyme ratio for 16h at 37Â°C. At
the end of incubation, SDS loading buffer was added and
samples heated at 100Â°C for 5min.

In-vitro modification of rTS and TS
We modified rTS based on the molar reaction ratios:
1 part rTS + 20 parts FdUMP + 112 parts DMTHF.
DMTHF was synthesized from THF as described [21],
omitting the purification of DMTHF. A mixture of rTS
and FdUMP incubated at RT for 1.5h. DMTHF was
added, incubating at RT in the dark for 2.5h. Reagents
were removed by filtration (3kD filter, Millipore) and
modified rTS (rTS-F) collected. An RKO cell lysate was
modified by adding FdUMP at 5ÂµM final concentration,
incubating for 30min at RT, adding DMTHF at 2.8mM
final concentration, and incubating in the dark at RT for
45min.

Protein gels and immunoblots
Protein gels and IB methods were as described
[22]. We used 4-12% or 10% Bis-Tris pre-cast gels
(Invitrogen). Coomassie staining of protein gels was
done as described [23]. For IB, 30Âµg of protein per well
was separated by elctrophoresis, gels were transferred to
PVDF membrane, blocked with 5% dry non-fat milk, and
probed with antibodies in 5% milk. After reaction with
secondary antibodies, membranes were developed using
chemiluminescence reagents (Thermo Scientific), and
signal was captured using film. Each experiment was
performed at least twice; representative data are shown.

Antibody generation
An attempt in mice to generate a TS-F-specific
monoclonal antibody was unsuccessful. rTS-F was
then used to immunize rats and generate a monoclonal
antibody. Hybridoma clones were screened for clone
expression based on enzyme-linked immuno sorbent assay
(ELISA) reactivity to rTS-F as compared to rTS (Creative
Diagnostics). One clone was verified by IB to be reactive
specifically to TS-F and not to TS-N upon testing TS
proteins from multiple sources (see below).

Xenograft experiments
Female athymic nude mice (Simenson Laboratories,
CA) were subcutaneously injected with RKO or
MiaPaCa2 cells at two flank sites. Each site was injected
with one million cells in Matrigel (BD Biosciences). Mice
developed xenograft tumors after three to four weeks.
Tumor-bearing mice were treated with 5FU intravenously
at doses of 0, 10, and 50mg/kg. Mice were euthanized
using carbon dioxide at 1h after injection. Tumors were
collected and snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen for storage at
-80ÂºC until analysis. The experiment was performed twice.

Cell line treatment
RKO and MiaPaCa2 cells were grown in 6-well
plates in DMEM (10%FBS, 1% pen/strep). Cells were
treated with 5FU at final concentration of 0, 0.4, 2, 10,
and 50ÂµM for 1h or 24h. At the end of the treatment, cells
were lysed using detergent (1% Triton X, 150mM NaCl,
50mM Tris-HCl, 1mM EDTA) and rotated for 30min at
4ÂºC. After pelleting by microcentrifugation for 10min, the
