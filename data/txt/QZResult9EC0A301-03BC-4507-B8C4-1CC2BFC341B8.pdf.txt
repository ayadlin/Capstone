Abstract
Colorectal cancer is associated with chronic inﬂammation and immunosuppression mediated by myeloidderived suppressor cells (MDSC). Although chemotherapy reduces tumor burden at early stages, it tends to have
limited effect on a progressive disease, possibly due to adverse effects on the immune system in dictating disease
outcome. Here, we show that patients with advanced colorectal cancer display enhanced MDSC levels and
reduced CD247 expression and that some conventional colorectal cancer chemotherapy supports the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. A FOLFOX combined therapy reduced immunosuppression, whereas a
FOLFIRI combined therapy enhanced immunosuppression. Mechanistic studies in a colorectal cancer mouse
model revealed that FOLFIRI-like therapy including the drugs CPT11 and 5-ﬂuorouracil (5FU) damaged host
immunocompetence in a manner that limits treatment outcomes. CPT11 blocked MDSC apoptosis and myeloid
cell differentiation, increasing MDSC immunosuppressive features and mouse mortality. In contrast, 5FU
promoted immune recovery and tumor regression. Thus, CPT11 exhibited detrimental immunoregulatory
effects that offset 5FU beneﬁts when administered in combination. Our results highlight the importance of
developing therapeutic regimens that can target both the immune system and tumor towards improved
personalized treatments for colorectal cancer. Cancer Res; 74(21); 6022–35. 2014 AACR.

Introduction
Colorectal cancer and certain other tumors are characterized
by chronic inﬂammation–induced immunosuppression mediated by proinﬂammatory cells and mediators (1–4), which
subvert the outcome of anticancer therapy. Myeloid-derived
suppressor cells (MDSC) are the main cell population causing
immunosuppression in numerous cancers including colorectal
cancer (3, 5–8). MDSCs are immature myeloid cells expanded in
the course of chronic inﬂammation, co-expressing Gr1þCD11bþ
in mice and CD11bþCD14CD33þ, LINHLA-DRCD33þ, or
CD14þCD11bþ in humans (6, 9).
Chemotherapeutic drugs commonly used to treat cancer,
including colorectal cancer, affect not only the tumor but also
the immune system, having a crucial impact on antitumor

responses and disease outcome (5, 10). Although chemotherapies combat the tumors and lead to their regression, the effects
on the tumor microenvironment and the immune system are
not clearly understood. Colorectal cancer is usually treated
with multiagent regimens, and in some cases, different drugs
that act via diverse mechanisms are combined as they may
have superior efﬁcacy and effectiveness when administered
jointly (11). The most common protocols for colorectal cancer
approved by the FDA are combined chemotherapies FOLFIRI
[folinic acid, 5-ﬂuorouracil (5FU), and CPT11] or FOLFOX
(folinic acid, 5FU, and oxaliplatin). Studies comparing between
these regimens indicated that in some cases FOLFOX is superior as it leads to higher overall survival rates (12, 13). However,
other studies have demonstrated equal efﬁcacy for these
treatments (14).
Even though chemotherapy for stage IV colorectal cancer
leads to tumor regression, in most cases, the survival time is
limited. We speculated that various drugs may differently
alter the immune status of patients with colorectal cancer,
thus affecting their therapeutic effectiveness. Monitoring the
immune status of patients with stage IV colorectal cancer,
before and following FOLFOX or FOLFIRI treatments,
revealed that before therapy the patients displayed a suppressed immune status as indicated by the elevated MDSC
levels and downregulated CD247, which is a key molecule
that "senses" immune functionality and regulates T-cell and
natural killer (NK) cell immune responses (15). During
chemotherapeutic treatments, while FOLFOX reduced

Adverse Effects of Chemotherapies on MDSCs in Colorectal Cancer

accumulation of circulating MDSCs that was accompanied
by upregulated CD247 expression, FOLFIRI displayed opposite effects, enhancing the suppressive environment.
To gain better understanding of 5FU and CPT11 adverse
effects on host immunity, we used a mouse colorectal cancer
model that mimics the human disease (1). Herein we show that
similar to the patients, colorectal cancer mice display an
immunosuppressive status. In assessing CPT11 and 5FU
monotherapies, we discovered that CPT11, but not 5FU,
increases immunosuppression by inducing MDSC insensitivity
to apoptosis, arresting their differentiation and retaining their
suppressive features. Moreover, 5FU þ CPT11 combined treatment displays harmful effects, resulting in a dysfunctional
immune response associated with cancer progression and
short survival, showing that CPT11 antagonizes the anticancer
activity of 5FU by exerting its detrimental immunoregulatory
effects. Our data suggest a signiﬁcant impact of a given
chemotherapeutic protocol on both the tumor and its immunosuppressive environment.

Patients and Methods
Patients
Peripheral blood samples were collected from 23 patients
with stage IV metastatic colorectal cancer before and every
2 months in the course of chemotherapy treatments. All
patients who were diagnosed with metastatic colorectal
cancer underwent surgery and were not previously treated
with chemotherapy. Twenty healthy donors were used as
controls. The samples were taken according to the Helsinki
approval and analyzed for the indicated immune biomarkers in a "blinded test," not knowing the therapy speciﬁcation. Following analyses completion, the speciﬁc treatment
regiments and clinical parameters were acquired from
medical records of the patients under the care of Dr. Ayala
Hubert at the Oncology department, Hadassah University
Medical Center Ein Kerem (Jerusalem, Israel) and correlation tests were performed.
Mice
Female C57BL/6 and BALB/c mice (aged 6–8 weeks) were
purchased from Harlan and were grown at the Hebrew University speciﬁc pathogen-free facility. All experiments were
done in accordance with preapproved institutional protocols.
Reagents
Azoxymethane and dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) were
purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and MP Biochemicals Inc.,
respectively.
In vivo mouse models for colorectal cancer and a tumorfree chronic inﬂammation
Mice were injected intraperitoneally with 10 mg/kg body
weight of AOM dissolved in physiological saline twice in 2
weeks' intervals. Two weeks later, 2% DSS was given in the
drinking water over 7 days, following by 14 days of regular
water (16). This cycle was repeated twice. Animals were
sacriﬁced and analyzed 3 weeks after the last treatment.

www.aacrjournals.org

To induce a pathology-free chronic inﬂammation, we used a
previously described protocol subjecting mice to heat-killed
Mycobacterium tuberculosis (BCG) treatment (17).
Chemotherapeutic drugs
In vivo efﬁcacy of chemotherapeutic FDA-approved drugs on
the immune status was determined under: (i) colorectal cancer
conditions: a day after the second DSS administration, chemotherapy treatment was applied intraperitoneally twice a
week in a 3-day interval for 3 weeks and (ii) chronic inﬂammatory tumor-free conditions: a day after the second BCG
injection, chemotherapy treatment was applied intraperitoneally twice a week. The chemotherapies were scaled according
to FDA-approved dosages: 5FU and CPT11 50 mg/kg each.
The chemotherapeutic drugs' ex vivo effects were tested on
MDSCs isolated from inﬂamed mice, using a magnetic column
separation system (Miltenyi Biotec), as previously described
(18). Two cycles of puriﬁcations, one with Gr1 antibodies
(Biolegend) and a second with CD11b antibodies (Biolegend),
were performed. The purity of the cell populations was more
than 95%. After puriﬁcation, cells were grown in tissue culture,
treated for 24 hours with 5FU and CPT11 at 1.25, 2.5, and 5
mmol/L concentrations for cleaved caspase-3 detection assay
and with 5FU, CPT11, and 5FU þ CPT11 (2.5 mmol/L each drug)
for nitric oxide (NO) and reactive oxygen species (ROS)
production assay.
In vivo depletion of MDSCs
For the MDSC depletion assay, at the same day of the second
DSS administration, CPT11-treated colorectal cancer mice
were administered intraperitoneally every 3 days with 0.5 mg
of anti-Gr1 mAb (RB6-8C5).
Carboxyﬂuorescein diacetate succinimidyl ester staining
and ex vivo T-cell proliferation assay
Splenocytes or puriﬁed T cells isolated by a magnetic
column separation system (Miltenyi Biotec) were labeled with
5 mmol/L carboxyﬂuorescein diacetate succinimidyl ester
(CFSE; Invitrogen) and subjected to T-cell receptor–mediated
activation as previously described (17).
Ex vivo myeloid cell differentiation
MDSCs were isolated from colorectal cancer and control
(normal) mice and cultured in the presence or absence of 10
ng/mL granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor
(GM-CSF; PeproTech) for 3 days. In some samples, 5FU and
CPT11 were added to the cells, with or without GM-CSF,
followed by phenotyping using ﬂow cytometry.
Flow cytometric analysis
Isolated mouse splenocytes and peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) were subjected to cell surface staining as previously
described (17), using the following antibodies (Biolegend):
ﬂuorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-labeled anti-Gr1 and antiCD11c; phycoerythrin (PE)-labeled anti-F4/80, anti-CD3e, and
anti-mNKp46; and biotinylated anti-CD11b detected with
streptavidin-Cy5. Intracellular staining for CD247 was performed as previously described (17) by using FITC-labeled

anti-CD247 or biotinylated anti-CD247 (lone H146), the latter
detected with streptavidin-Cy5. Foxp3 staining was performed
according to the manufacturer's instructions (Miltenyi Biotec).
Cleaved caspase-3 staining was performed using primary
rabbit anti-cleaved caspase-3 (Cell Signaling Technology,
Asp175) and secondary FITC-horse anti-rabbit antibody
(Thermo Scientiﬁc). For intracellular NO and ROS detection,
diaminoﬂuoresciein-2 diacetate (DAF-2DA) reagent (NOS 2001; Cell Technology) and aminophenyl ﬂuorescein (APF; 4011;
Cell Technology) were used, respectively, and determined by
ﬂow cytometric analysis.
For human whole blood cell phenotyping, intracellular staining of CD247 cells was performed by ﬁrst ﬁxing the cells with 1%
paraformaldehyde followed by washes and permeabilized with
0.1% saponin. Allophycocyanin-labeled anti-CD11b and antiCD3, PE-labeled anti-CD33, FITC-labeled anti-HLA-DR, and
anti-CD247 were used, all purchased from BD Pharmingen
and used according to the manufacturer's protocol. After
surface staining, cells were treated eBioscience-Step Fix/Lyse
solution according to the manufacturer's instructions. All
samples were analyzed using FACS Calibur with Cell Quest
software (BD).
Cell isolation from the colon
The preparation of single-cell suspensions from colons was
performed using a modiﬁed version of a previously described
protocol (19). Brieﬂy, isolated colons were washed with HBSS
5% FBS (Invitrogen), digested, minced, incubated for 15 minutes at 37 C, and epithelial cell suspension was washed with
RPMI. For lamina propria cells, the retained tissue was transferred to collagenase/DNAse (Roche Diagnostic Corporation)
solution, incubated for 1 hour at 37 C, ﬁltrated, and washed
with RPMI.
Quantitative PCR analysis
Total RNA was recovered from colon cells, splenocytes, or
isolated MDSCs and subjected to real-time PCR analysis as
previously described (17). The sequences of the oligonucleotides used are listed in Supplementary Table S1.
Western blot analysis
Cells isolated from the spleen or colon were analyzed by
Western blotting for the expression of various proteins
as previously described (17). The antibodies used for immunoblotting were: anti-S100A9, anti-S100A8, and anti-a-tubulin. Speciﬁc antibodies were detected by anti-rabbit or
anti-goat antibodies conjugated to horseradish peroxidase
(HRP; Jackson ImmunoResearch), followed by enhanced
chemiluminescence and exposure at blotting reader (BioRad software).
Histopathology and immunohistochemistry
Parafﬁn-embedded colon tissue sections were prepared
from colorectal cancer, colorectal cancer–5FU, or colorectal
cancer–CPT11–treated and control untreated mice and
stained with hematoxylin and eosin solution. For immunohistochemistry, after antigen retrieval, sections were incubated at
4 C with primary antibodies: anti-b-catenin (BD) and anti-Gr-1

(Biolegend). For immunohistochemical staining, universal
immunoperoxidase polymer for mouse tissues (414311F; Histoﬁne) was used, based on an HRP-labeled polymer conjugated
to anti-rat. After incubation for 30 minutes, slide staining was
completed by 3- to 5-minute incubation with DAB þ Chromogen (Lab Vision), followed by counterstaining with hematoxylin. As a control, samples were stained with each antibody
and reagent individually.
Statistical analysis
Statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism
5.04. Averaged values are presented as the mean  SEM. When
comparing two groups, statistical signiﬁcance was determined
using 2-tailed Student t test. When more than two groups were
investigated, an ANOVA was performed. Survival analyses were
assessed using the Fisher exact test.
For the human experiments, paired t test was used to
compare samples from the same patients before and after
FOLFOX or FOLFIRI treatment. Control and colorectal cancer
groups were investigated by ANOVA.

Results
FOLFOX and FOLFIRI therapies of patients with
colorectal cancer display opposite effects on
CD11bþCD33þHLA-DR myeloid cells and immune
status
Progression of colorectal cancer involves the development of
a chronic inﬂammatory and immunosuppressive milieu. We
therefore proposed that some chemotherapies may have limited beneﬁcial effects due to their harmful impact on the
patients' immune status. To verify this possibility, we ﬁrst
assessed the immune status of 23 patients with stage IV
colorectal cancer before a given chemotherapy in comparison
to 20 healthy donors. The percentage of CD11bþCD33þHLADR MDSCs in the patients' peripheral blood was signiﬁcantly
higher (12.65%  1.35%, P < 0.01) than in healthy donors (5.35%
 1.05%; Fig. 1A). Moreover, we found a signiﬁcant increased
production of both NO and ROS in MDSCs, as compared with
healthy donors (Fig. 1B), showing their immunosuppressive
features in the blood of patients with colorectal cancer. We also
found an inverse correlation between the percentage of circulating MDSCs and CD247 expression in the patients with
colorectal cancer (Fig. 1C), suggesting an impaired immune
status associated with the disease. To examine the impact of
FOLFOX and FOLFIRI on immune parameters of patients with
stage IV colorectal cancer, we followed the effects of these
drugs on the kinetics of MDSC levels and the association with
CD247 expression. All patients were treated with chemotherapy for at least 6 months. PBL analysis revealed decreased
levels of circulating MDSCs following FOLFOX treatments (Fig.
1D, left), which were associated with a tendency of upregulated
CD247 expression (Fig. 1D, right). In contrast, during the
course of FOLFIRI treatment of patients with colorectal cancer,
the MDSC percentage continuously increased, correlating with
CD247 downregulation (Fig. 1E). These results suggest an
adverse impact of the different chemotherapies on the immune
status of patients with colorectal cancer.

Adverse Effects of Chemotherapies on MDSCs in Colorectal Cancer

tumor progression (16). Histologic analyses of colons from
CPT11-treated colorectal cancer mice demonstrated not only
a loss of entire crypts and surface epithelial layer but also a
massive leukocyte inﬁltration into the mucosa (Fig. 2C). Importantly, immunohistochemical probing of MDSCs within the
colon revealed elevated levels in untreated and in CPT11treated but not in 5FU-treated colorectal cancer mice (Fig.
2D, top). The same correlation between MDSC accumulation
and the given treatment was also observed when testing tumors
in colons (Fig. 2D, bottom). Analysis of cells generated from the
colon lamina propria and epithelium depicted increased MDSC
numbers in the CPT11 treated as compared with untreated
colorectal cancer mice (Fig. 2E). A signiﬁcantly reduced MDSC
inﬁltration was observed in both the lamina propria and
epithelium following 5FU treatment (Fig. 2E and Supplementary Fig. S2A). Furthermore, a signiﬁcant reduction of NO
production was found in lamina propria and epithelial MDSCs
from 5FU-treated colorectal cancer mice (Fig. 2F), whereas after
CPT11 treatment, the NO levels remained elevated as compared with the colorectal cancer untreated mice. These results
strengthen the harmful effects of CPT11 supporting MDSC
accumulation and suppressive features at the tumor site.
CPT11 treatment increases systemic
immunosuppression and counteracts 5FU beneﬁcial
effects
We next investigated whether CPT11 and 5FU also differently affect the systemic immunosuppressive state.
Untreated, CPT11-, and 5FU þ CPT11–treated colorectal
cancer mice display stronger inﬂammatory response as
indicated by the enlarged spleen size as compared with
5FU-treated colorectal cancer or control mice (Fig. 3A) and
by the signiﬁcantly decreased MDSC numbers in spleens of
5FU-treated colorectal cancer mice as compared with those
of the untreated colorectal cancer mice or those treated with
CPT11 or 5FU þ CPT11 (Fig. 3B). Interestingly, none of the
monotherapies altered the high percentage of regulatory T
cells (CD4þFoxp3þTregs) observed in colorectal cancer mice
(Supplementary Fig. S3), showing that mainly MDSCs are
affected by 5FU and CPT11.
Moreover, we found that while MDSCs from 5FU-treated
colorectal cancer mice displayed a signiﬁcantly reduced NO
and ROS production, MDSCs from CPT11- or 5FU þ CPT11–
treated colorectal cancer mice displayed elevated levels, as
compared with untreated colorectal cancer mice (Fig. 3C). Ex
vivo studies showed that 5FU administration does not alter
NO or ROS production in puriﬁed cultured MDSCs, but the
addition of CPT11 or 5FU þ CPT11 to the medium resulted in
their elevation (Supplementary Fig. S4A), suggesting a direct
effect of the drugs on MDSC suppressive features. Both monocytic (CD11bþ Ly6Chigh Ly6G) and granulocytic (CD11bþ
Ly6Clow Ly6Gþ) cell populations showed increased NO (Supplementary Fig. S4B, left) and ROS (Supplementary Fig. S4B,
right) production upon CPT11 or 5FU þ CPT11 treatment.
However, the monocytic population displayed a more pronounced NO production, whereas granulocytic population
showed more ROS production (Supplementary Fig. S4A and
S4B). Thus, CPT11 supports the immunosuppressive environ-

ment when applied alone or in a combination with 5FU,
affecting the whole MDSC population.
We next evaluated the effect of the given chemotherapies on
the immune status and tested the function of the whole T-cell
population (Fig. 3D) and CD8þ T cells (Supplementary Fig.
S4C) from all experimental groups along with the expression
levels of CD247 in CD3þ (Fig. 3E) and in CD8þ T cells
(Supplementary Fig. S4D). The results revealed a decreased
T-cell proliferative ability following both CPT11 and 5FU þ
CPT11 treatments. In contrast, 5FU treatment of colorectal
cancer mice did not affect T-cell proliferation, as compared
with untreated colorectal cancer mice. Moreover, T-cell function was correlated with CD247 expression levels; low CD247
levels were obtained in T cells from colorectal cancer mice
untreated and treated with CPT11 or a 5FU þ CPT11 combination, whereas elevated levels were obtained upon 5FU
treatment. Similar results were found in T cells isolated from
the lamina propria and epithelium, inversely correlating
with the local generated immunosuppressive environment
(Supplementary Fig. S2B). Thus, CPT11 and 5FU adversely
affect not only the tumor but also the immune system, pointing
at the dominating harmful effects of CPT11 when combined
with 5FU.
CPT11 harmful effects on the host's immune function are
mediated via MDSCs
The observed MDSC elevation and increased tumor load in
CPT11-treated colorectal cancer mice (Figs. 2–4) suggest an
impact of CPT11 on MDSC-induced cancer progression. We
hypothesized that MDSC depletion could reduce CPT11 harmful effect on the immune status, thus enhancing the antitumor
effect. Indeed, in vivo MDSC depletion in CPT11-treated colorectal cancer mice (Supplementary Fig. S5) as indicated by the
negligible MDSC levels as compared with CPT11 and 5FU þ
CPT11–treated colorectal cancer mice (Fig. 4A) led to an
almost complete regression of the tumors (Fig. 4B). Moreover,
histopathologic analysis revealed a differentiated adenocarcinoma in the colons of colorectal cancer mice, CPT11-, and 5FU
þ CPT11–treated colorectal cancer mice, whereas only
few aberrant crypt foci and tumors were detected in colons
of 5FU-treated colorectal cancer mice and CPT11-treated
MDSC-depleted colorectal cancer mice (Fig. 4C). This pattern
indicates a beneﬁcial effect of 5FU that attenuates colorectal
cancer progression with a harmful contribution of CPT11,
supporting immunosuppression and tumor progression via
its effects on MDSCs. The daily recorded vitality and survival of
the mice show a rapid deterioration, with increased death rates
in colorectal cancer mice treated with CPT11 or 5FU þ CPT11,
as compared with the 5FU, or CPT11-treated MDSC-depleted
colorectal cancer mice, or even to untreated colorectal cancer
mice (Fig. 4D).
MDSCs are insensitive to apoptosis under CPT11
treatment but become susceptible after 5FU treatment
We next aimed to explore the mechanisms responsible for
the opposite effects of 5FU and CPT11 on MDSC accumulation.
These drugs could differently affect MDSC levels by changing
their sensitivity to apoptosis, as previously reported for 5FU

MDSCs from 5FU-treated colorectal cancer mice, similar to
that detected in MDSCs from control mice (Fig. 5A). In
contrast, following CPT11 or 5FU þ CPT11 treatment, MDSCs
displayed decreased cleaved caspase-3 levels, as in splenic
MDSCs of untreated colorectal cancer mice (Fig. 5A). Moreover, ex vivo studies revealed that 5FU but not CPT11 leads to
cleaved caspase-3 upregulation in puriﬁed cultured MDSCs in
a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 5B and C). Interestingly, 5FUinduced apoptosis was evident only in nondifferentiated
MDSCs (Fig. 5D) whereas dendritic cells (Fig. 5E) and macrophages (Fig. 5F) were insensitive, suggesting an exclusive effect
of 5FU on the immature myeloid cell population. We also found
that 5FU controls both monocytic and granulocytic puriﬁed

drugs did not affect the apoptotic state of other immune

Figure 4. CPT11 harmful effects supporting tumor progression are mediated via MDSCs. Colorectal cancer mice were subjected to 5FU, CPT11, or a 5FU þ

randomly separated into two groups; one group continued with CPT11 treatment, whereas the second group was treated with anti-Gr1 mAb for MDSC
depletion in addition to CPT11 treatment. Three weeks after the second DSS treatment, mice were sacriﬁced and PBLs (A) and colons (B and C) were analyzed.

Figure 5. 5FU and CPT11 directly and differently affect MDSC sensitivity to apoptosis. A, splenic MDSCs from each group were analyzed for the expression of
activated (cleaved) caspase-3 by ﬂow cytometric analysis, gating on MDSCs. To assess the direct effect of 5FU (B) and CPT11 (C) on cleaved caspase-3
expression, primary MDSCs isolated from spleens of colorectal cancer mice (n ¼ 6) were ex vivo incubated with various doses of the drugs for 3 days and
subjected to ﬂow cytometric analysis. To assess which cells are affected by the chemotherapeutic drugs, MDSCs isolated from spleens of colorectal cancer
mice were cultured ex vivo with 10 ng/mL of GM-CSF in the absence or presence of scaled doses (0, 1.25, 2.5, and 5 mmol/L) of 5FU or CPT11 for 3 days.

Cleaved caspase-3 levels were then evaluated on the primary MDSCs (D), differentiated CD11c CD11b dendritic cells (E), and F4/80 CD11b macrophages
(F). All experiments involved six mice per group and were repeated three times, yielding similar results. Graphs (means of triplicates  SEM, n ¼ 6) are

immature suppressive stage toward differentiated nonsuppressive myeloid phenotype (17). Indeed, 5FU treatment of
colorectal cancer mice resulted in a signiﬁcant shift toward
differentiated dendritic cells and macrophages (Fig. 6C) and
to matured antigen-presenting cells, shown by the induced
CD80 and MHCII expression (Fig. 6D). In contrast, CPT11
treatment blocked myeloid cell differentiation in vivo (Fig.
6C and D).
When testing the ex vivo direct effects of the drugs on GMCSF–mediated colorectal cancer–derived MDSC differentiation, we detected that, similar to the in vivo effects, CPT11
prevented cell differentiation after both 48 hours (data not
shown) and 72 hours (Fig. 6E) as compared with MDSCs
incubated with GM-CSF only. In contrast, 5FU enabled
MDSC differentiation to dendritic cells and macrophages
(Fig. 6F). Interestingly, ex vivo CPT11-mediated MDSC differentiation blockade was associated with increased mRNA
levels of the proinﬂammatory mediators TNFa (Supplementary Fig. S7B) S100A9 (Supplementary Fig. S7C), whereas
the 5FU-induced MDSC differentiation correlated with
decreased levels of these factors. Thus, 5FU directly affects
the differentiation pathway of MDSCs, whereas CPT11 exhi-

bits a differentiation blockade capacity when added to GMCSF–treated MDSCs.
5FU and CPT11 opposing effects on MDSCs are tumorindependent
To examine whether the immunoregulatory effects of 5FU
and CPT11 are tumor-dependent, we used a mouse model for
chronic inﬂammation and associated immunosuppression
(15), described in the Materials and Methods and Fig. 7A. The
5FU beneﬁcial and CPT11 harmful effects were similar to those
observed in the colorectal cancer model. 5FU signiﬁcantly
reduced MDSC levels (Fig. 7B and C and Supplementary Fig.
S8A) and NO and ROS production (Fig. 7D). Treatment with
5FU also elevated cleaved caspase-3 levels (Fig. 7E), as compared with inﬂamed-untreated mice. In contrast, CPT11 or
5FU þ CPT11 treatments induced opposite effects (Fig. 7B–E).
No changes in CD4þFoxp3þ Tregs percentage were detected
(Supplementary Fig. S8B), conﬁrming that these chemotherapies speciﬁcally affect MDSCs.
We next assessed whether the 5FU and CPT11 opposite
effects on MDSCs have different impacts on the host's immune
competence. Assessment of the drugs' effects on total T-cell

Adverse Effects of Chemotherapies on MDSCs in Colorectal Cancer

activity and speciﬁcally CD8þ T cells revealed a signiﬁcant
recovery of CD247 expression in the spleen and PBLs as well as
T-cell proliferation following 5FU but not CPT11 or 5FU þ
CPT11 treatments (Fig. 7F and Supplementary Fig. S8C and
S8D). Similar effects were also detected when analyzing NK
cells; downregulated CD247 expression detected in NK cells
from chronically inﬂamed mice was almost completely recovered upon 5FU but not CPT11 treatment (Supplementary Fig.
S8E). Because NK cell activity is mediated via natural cytotoxicity receptors (NCR), which associate with and depend on
CD247, we assessed NK cell in vivo function by monitoring the
clearance of adoptively transferred allogeneic cells. A complete
recovery of NK cell activity both in the spleen and PBLs was
detected following 5FU treatment (Fig. 7G), along with a
signiﬁcant decreased clearance of allogeneic cells after CPT11
or 5FU þ CPT11 treatments. These results indicate that 5FU
and CPT11 opposite effects on MDSCs are tumor-independent,
displaying a signiﬁcant impact on effector T-cell and NK cell
responsiveness under chronic inﬂammatory conditions.

Discussion
Colorectal cancer appears in most cases as adenocarcinoma
that develops from the lining of the large intestine (colon) and
rectum and is supported and progressed by chronic intestinal
inﬂammation as in patients with inﬂammatory bowel disease
(23–25). Despite the clinical progress in detection and treatment,
colorectal cancer remains one of the major causes of cancerrelated death. In inﬂammation-driven tumors, an immunosuppressive microenvironment, which is characterized by MDSC
accumulation within the tumor and periphery (1, 8, 17, 26, 27),
poses a serious obstacle in cancer chemotherapy, attenuating
the capacity of conventional drugs to evoke a robust antitumor
immunity.
In the present study, we highlight novel mechanisms
underlying the action of the commonly used 5FU and CPT11
chemotherapies, showing their effect not only on the tumor
but also on its immunosuppressive environment. Our initial
studies with patients with stage IV colorectal cancer show
that before treatment the patients displayed an immunosuppressive status indicated by elevated MDSC levels and
the downregulated CD247 expression, which is critical for
T-cell and NK cell activities. Moreover, we demonstrate that
while FOLFOX treatment of patients with colorectal cancer
led to a decrease in MDSC levels and a gradual upregulation
of CD247 expression, FOLFIRI had opposite and harmful
effects. Such adverse effects between drugs could have a
signiﬁcant impact on the overall antitumor response and
disease outcome. Our results were obtained using a limited
number of patients as an initial proof of concept. Randomized clinical studies using larger patient cohort should be
performed comparing these therapies to validate our initial
observations.
Recent data demonstrated that 5FU treatment leads to a
selective MDSC apoptosis and tumor regression in mice (20).
Hence, the harmful effects of FOLFIRI on the immune status
of patients with colorectal cancer suggested that CPT11
might have detrimental immunoregulatory effects that offset

www.aacrjournals.org

the anticancerous impact of 5FU when given together. This
was conﬁrmed by testing the effects of 5FU and CPT11 on a
colorectal cancer mouse model, showing that colorectal
cancer mice display immunosuppressive features, similar
to patients with colorectal cancer manifested by elevated
MDSC levels, impaired T-cell function associated with
downregulated CD247 expression. A comparison between
the effects of 5FU and CPT11 mono or combined 5FU þ
CPT11 therapies revealed that the overall effect of the CPT11
in both therapies was harmful; yielding a strong immunosuppression mediated via MDSCs and associated with a
rapid disease progression and decreased survival as compared with the beneﬁcial effects of 5FU alone. These results
suggest that CPT11 reinforces the immunosuppressive environment in colorectal cancer mice and patients and dominates the beneﬁcial effects of 5FU in the FOLFIRI regimen,
thus leading to an overall harmful effect.
Detailed analysis of the mechanisms underlying CPT11
and 5FU adverse effects and the affected pathways revealed
that in colorectal cancer mice, 5FU reduced MDSC levels,
both by inducing their apoptotic death and by enforcing
myeloid cell differentiation to mature macrophages and
dendritic cells. The former drug effect is associated with
elevated levels of cleaved caspase-3 and the latter involves a
decreased expression of the proinﬂammatory S100A8/9 proteins, known to induce MDSC differentiation arrest
(17, 22, 28). In contrast, treatment with CPT11 had opposite
effects on colorectal cancer–associated MDSCs. CPT11 also
directly affects MDSCs by boosting secretion of proinﬂammatory cytokines such as TNFa, which is a key MDSC
regulator, inducing their differentiation arrest via S100A8/9
and increasing their suppressive activity (17). Thus, in untreated and CPT11-treated colorectal cancer mice, but not in 5FUtreated colorectal cancer mice, multiple changes occur in the
tumor micro- and macroenvironments that directly enhance
tumor growth and support indirectly its progression by inhibiting antitumor immunity.
Immunosuppressive MDSCs that accumulate during colorectal cancer and upon treatment with CPT11 or a 5FU þ
CPT11 combination produce elevated levels of NO and ROS
that could induce DNA damage and formation of colonic
adenomas (29). In addition, S100A8/9 produced upon CPT11
treatment could interact with receptors for advanced-glycation end products (RAGE) and carboxylated glycans expressed
on colorectal cancer cells, thereby promoting activation of
MAPK and NF-kB signaling pathways. These, in turn, upregulate a cohort of proteins that promote leukocyte recruitment,
angiogenesis, tumor migration, and establishment of premetastatic niches in distal organs (28). Moreover, the generated
proinﬂammatory environment can affect Wnt/b-catenin signaling as reﬂected herein by nuclear accumulation of b-catenin
in tumors of untreated and CPT11-treated colorectal cancer
mice. The attenuated immunosuppression during 5FU treatment improves the therapeutic outcome as it enables the
generation of anticancer immunity and superior tumor
regression.
Our ﬁndings regarding the immunosuppression relief by
5FU are corroborated by a recent report demonstrating that

5FU does not induce ROS activation in MDSCs. In this study,
however, the authors also demonstrated that 5FU induces a
direct activation of the NLRP3 inﬂammasome through the
release of cathepsin B from lysosomes, leading to secretion of
IL1b, production of IL17, and tumor growth. NLRP3 activation
in the tumor microenvironment could diminish antitumor
immunity by facilitating migration of MDSCs to the tumor
site (30). Hence, multiple regulatory pathways of MDSC function are targeted by 5FU and the drug susceptibility of both the
tumor and its environment will dictate the therapy outcome;
5FU could accelerate IL1b secretion and inﬂammasome activation (5) as well as attenuate Treg activity and promote
autoreactive T-cell expansion (31). Herein, we show that even
though Tregs are elevated in both inﬂamed and colorectal
cancer mice, upon 5FU treatment, MDSCs and their suppressive activity are signiﬁcantly decreased. These effects were
sufﬁcient to improve T-cell and NK cell antitumor activities,
indicating that in the absence of MDSCs, other factors do not
necessarily worsen host immune function.
Taken together, we demonstrate that conventional measurements of chemotherapeutic effects on the tumor are
insufﬁcient to evaluate their curative effectiveness. Rather, it
is mandatory to assess the drug effects on the immune function
as well, as the combined impact on both the tumor and
immune system will dictate the disease outcome. We wish to
stress the signiﬁcance of MDSC-mediated immunosuppressive
environment and its sensitivity to chemotherapy in determining the most appropriate therapeutic regimen. While our study
alludes to patients with advanced disease, it may bear even
greater relevance to patients with colorectal cancer at earlier
stages when monitored before and following treatment. We
also suggest that by monitoring the host's immune function
using unique biomarkers as CD247 and MDSCs, the efﬁcacy of
a given treatment could be evaluated and modiﬁed accordingly
if required. Once MDSC-mediated immunosuppression is
detected, modalities leading to MDSC elimination, differentiation, or neutralization should be considered as auxiliary
therapy (32) in addition to the antitumor chemotherapy or

to the currently developing anti-colorectal cancer immune–
based treatments as speciﬁc tumor-inﬁltrating lymphocytes or
anti-CTLA4 and/or anti-PD1 antibodies (33, 34) that will
necessitate a functional immune system to gain efﬁcient
treatment efﬁcacies. Thus, a selection of appropriate antitumor combined therapy should lead to an improved design of
future cancer personalized treatments.
