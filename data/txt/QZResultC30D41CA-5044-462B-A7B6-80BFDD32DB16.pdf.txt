Abstract
Adoptive cell therapy with engineered T cells to improve natural immune response and antitumor
functions has shown promise for treating cancer. However, the requirement for extensive ex vivo manipulation of T cells and the immunosuppressive effects of the tumor microenvironment limit this therapeutic
modality. In the present study, we investigated the possibility to circumvent these limitations by engineering
Stat3-deficient CD8þ T cells or by targeting Stat3 in the tumor microenvironment. We show that ablating
Stat3 in CD8þ T cells prior to their transfer allows their efficient tumor infiltration and robust proliferation,
resulting in increased tumor antigen-specific T-cell activity and tumor growth inhibition. For potential
clinical translation, we combined adoptive T-cell therapy with a Food and Drug Administration–approved
tyrosine kinase inhibitor, sunitinib, in renal cell carcinoma and melanoma tumor models. Sunitinib inhibited
Stat3 in dendritic cells and T cells and reduced conversion of transferred FoxP3 T cells to tumor-associated
regulatory T cells while increasing transferred CD8þ T-cell infiltration and activation at the tumor site,
leading to inhibition of primary tumor growth. These data show that adoptively transferred T cells can be
expanded and activated in vivo either by engineering Stat3-silenced T cells or by targeting Stat3 systemically
with small-molecule inhibitors. Cancer Res; 70(23); 9599–610. 2010 AACR.

Introduction
Adoptive T-cell therapy has shown promise for cancer
therapy. Despite several recent advances, however, this treatment modality still faces a number of challenges. One major
challenge is that ex vivo expanded, antigen-specific T cells must
proliferate and preserve their effector functions and homing
abilities over many weeks prior to infusion into patients and
then remain active after infusion in order to generate therapeutic effects (1, 2). Even when T cells are engineered and
expanded for optimal tumor specificity and homing, the tumor
microenvironment plays a major role in determining the
success of immune-based therapy (3, 4). T lymphocyte populations within a tumor are heterogeneous, and infiltrating T cells

have been associated with either improved or poor prognosis,
depending on the type of T-cell population (5, 6). Antitumor
immune responses driven by effector T cells are limited by their
susceptibility to the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. The immunosuppressive effects are largely generated by
cytokines and other tumor-produced factors and by immune
cells within the tumor microenvironment such as myeloid
derived suppressor cells (MDSC) and regulatory T cells (Tregs;
refs. 7, 8). In addition, tumors can also express ligands, such as
PD-L1, for turning off T-cell antitumor effects (9).
Signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (Stat3)
acts as a point of convergence for several oncogenic signaling
pathways and is persistently activated in numerous tumors as
well as in various immune cells within the tumor microenvironment (4, 10, 11). By virtue of its ability to upregulate
expression of multiple factors that are upstream of Stat3,
the activity of Stat3 can be propagated from tumor cells to
diverse immune cells, and vice versa, creating a cross talk
between cancer cells and surrounding stroma (4, 11). Moreover, Stat3-regulated factors, such as vascular endothelial
growth factor (VEGF), interleukin-6 (IL-6), interleukin-10
(IL-10), and interleukin-23 (IL-23), among many others, promote tumor growth, angiogenesis, and invasion (12–14). Stat3
signaling in both tumor cells and the tumor-associated
immune cells plays an important role in promoting MDSC
and Tregs (4, 15). In addition to promoting expression of
immunosuppressive molecules, Stat3 negatively regulates
expression of immunostimulatory factors in both tumor cells
and myeloid cells, resulting in a microenvironment strongly

reducing immune recognition and response against tumors.
Our previous studies indicate that blocking Stat3 signaling
within the myeloid compartment enhances antitumor
immune responses through interruption of the immunosuppressive network that inhibits normal function of both adaptive and innate immunity (16, 17). However, whether Stat3
signaling within CD8þ T cells is inhibitory to their antitumor
effector functions remains unknown.
Sunitinib is an orally bioavailable oxindole small-molecule
tyrosine kinase inhibitor of vascular endothelial growth factor
receptor (VEGFR)-1, VEGFR-2, VEGFR-3, platelet-derived
growth factor receptor a (PDGFR)-a, PDGFR-b, and stem
cell factor (18). Growth inhibition of multiple implanted solid
tumors and eradication of larger, established tumors has been
shown in mouse xenograft models (19). Sunitinib therapy has
shown improved survival for patients with metastatic renal
cell carcinoma (RCC) and has become a front-line therapy for
the disease (20). Sunitinib has also shown antitumor efficacy
in multiple tumor types, indicating its multifaceted role in
tumor growth inhibition (21). Recent studies have evaluated
the role of sunitinib in modulating immune cells within the
tumor microenvironment. Sunitinib has been shown to inhibit
MDSC and Tregs in RCC patients (22, 23) and in mouse tumor
models (24, 25). In addition, sunitinib can inhibit Stat3, leading
to increased tumor apoptosis and decreased MDSC and Tregs
in tumor-bearing mice (26).
Although the role of Stat3 in both tumor cells, myeloid cells
and Tregs, in promoting the immunosuppressive tumor
microenvironment is well known, whether Stat3 signaling
within CD8þ T cells affects T-cell effector functions remains
unclear. Therefore, we investigated the feasibility of targeting
Stat3 in T cells to promote tumor infiltration and expansion of
transferred T cells and stimulation of T-cell functions. Our
results showed that these criteria can be met by either
transferring Stat3-deficient CD8þ-naive T cells or by systemic
sunitinib treatment to inhibit Stat3 signaling in conjunction
with T-cell transfer. These findings serve as a platform to
genetically modify T cells to block Stat3 prior to transfer and/
or to use effective direct or indirect Stat3 inhibitors to
modulate the tumor microenvironment to improve adoptive
T-cell immunotherapy.

monitored.
Animals
Stat3flox mice were provided by S. Akira (Laboratory of Host
Defense, World Premiere International Immunology Frontier
Research Center and Research Institute for Microbial Diseases,
Osaka University) and K. Takeda (Department of Molecular
Genetics, Medical Institute of Bioregulation, Kyushu University). C57BL/6 and BALB/c mice were purchased from the
National Cancer Institute. CD4Cre mice were purchased from
Taconic, OVA TCR (OT-I), GFPþ, Rag1/ and Rag2/ transgenic mice were purchased from the Jackson Laboratory.
FoxP3-GFP knock-in mice were provided by D. Zeng (Departments of Diabetes Research & Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation, Beckman Research Institute, City of Hope National
Medical Center). Mouse care and experimental procedures
were conducted under pathogen-free conditions in accordance
with established institutional guidance and approved protocols
from the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of
Beckman Research Institute at City of Hope National Medical
Center.
In vivo experiments and T-cell adoptive transfer
B16 or B16OVA melanoma cells (1  105) were injected
subcutaneously into Rag1/ or wild-type mice. Renca tumor
cells (2.5  106) were injected subcutaneously into Rag2/
mice. Mice received adoptive transfer of (8–10)  106 CD8þ T
cells 1 day prior or at days 5 or 6 after tumor challenge. CD8þ
cells were isolated from spleens and lymph nodes of donor
animals by magnetic beads enrichment using positive selection EasySep kits (StemCell Technologies) or MACS cell
separation system (Miltenyi Biotec). T cells were transferred
by retro-orbital injection. In experiments for in vivo Tregs
conversion, Rag1/ mice received 1  106 CD4þGFP cells
isolated from FoxP3-GFP knock-in C57BL/6 mice.
Sunitinib treatment
Sunitinib (SU11248; Sutent) was purchased from LC Laboratories or supplied by Pfizer Inc. Tumor-bearing mice received
sunitinib treatment at a dose of 30 to 40 mg/kg dissolved in
0.5% solution of carboxymethyl cellulose, administered orally
daily for up to 14 days.
Flow cytometry
Cell suspensions from lymph nodes and tumor tissues were
prepared as described previously (3) and stained with different
combinations of fluorochrome-coupled antibodies to CD4,
CD8, CD25, FoxP3, CD11c, CD11b, Gr1, phospho-Tyr705-Stat3
(BD Biosciences). Fluorescence data were collected on Accuri
C6 (Accuri Cytometers) or CyAn (Dako Cytomation, Inc.) and
analyzed using Cflow software (Accuri Cytometers) or FlowJo
software (Tree Star). For in vitro and in vivo experiments for
Tregs conversion, CD4þGFP cells were sorted using MoFlo
MLS cell sorter (Dako Cytomation, Inc.).
Immunofluorescence
Tumor tissue sections were fixated in 2% paraformaldehyde
and permeabilized in methanol. After blocking in PBS containing 10% goat serum and 2.5% mouse serum, slides were

incubated overnight with antibodies: rat anti-mouse CD4
(1:20; BD Biosciences) and rabbit anti-FoxP3 (1:500; Abcam).
Next day, the slides were washed and secondary antibodies
were applied for 1 hour (goat anti-rabbit, Alexa Fluor 488
labeled and goat anti-rat, Alexa Fluor 555, both 1:200; Molecular Probes).
Intravital multiphoton microscopy
Rag1/ mice bearing B16OVA tumors received adoptive
transfer of OVA-specific Stat3þ/þ and Stat3/ CD8þ cells (1.5
 107 of each) previously labeled with cell trackers (CMAC) or
OrangeCMTMR reagents (Molecular Probes) according to the
manufacturer's instructions. After 48 or 72 hours, mice were
anaesthetized with isoflurane/oxygen, followed by intravenous injection (via retro-orbital route) with dextran-fluoresceine (100 mg; Molecular Probes). Fifteen minutes later, tumor
tissues of mice were surgically exposed for intravital multiphoton microscopy (IVMPM) and imaged with an Ultima
Multiphoton Microscopy System (Prairie Technologies). For
recording fluoresceine and rhodamine emission signals, l ¼
860-nm excitation wavelength was used. Extracellular matrix
(ECM) was recorded using second harmonic generation (2HG)
using lexcit ¼ 890 nm. Band-pass filters optimized for and
rhodamine (BP l ¼ 570–620 nm), coumarin, and 2HG (BP l ¼
460/50 nm) were used for detection.
Enzyme-linked immunosorbent spot assay
To detect IFN-g or granzyme B enzyme-linked immunosorbent spot (ELISPOT) assay was conducted according to the
manufacture's protocols (Diaclone and R&D Systems, respectively). Briefly, 5  104 cells isolated from tumor draining
lymph nodes were cultured over night in the presence or
absence of peptides (SYMFECLE for B16OVA experiments and
p15E for B16 experiments, both at concentration of 10 mg/mL).
Peptide-specific IFN-g and granzyme B–positive spots were
detected following the manufacturer's protocol and manually
counted under the binocular.
In vivo CTL killing assay and proliferation assay
Splenocytes were harvested and split into 2 populations.
Target cell population was pulsed with 2 mg/mL of p15E
peptide for 2 hours at 37 C, followed by CFSEHi (10 mmol/L)
fluorescent labeling. The control cell population was not pulsed
but labeled with CFSELO (1 mmol/L). Equal numbers of CFSEHi
and CFSELO cells were mixed, followed by adoptive transfer
(intravenously) into B16 tumor-bearing animals. Each animal
received 2  107 cells. Cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) cytotoxic
effects (decrease of CFSEHi population) in mice that received
adoptive transfer of Stat3þ/þ or Stat3/ CD8þ cells (8  106)
were analyzed by flow cytometry (Accuri Cytometers). In
proliferation assay, tumor-bearing Rag1/ mice received
adoptive transfer of OVA-specific Stat3þ/þ or Stat3/ CD8þ
cells (1  107 of each) labeled with CFSE. CD8þ cells proliferation was analyzed 72 hours later by flow cytometry (Accuri
Cytometers).
In vitro Tregs conversion
CD4þGFP cells sorted from splenocytes isolated from
FoxP3-GFP knock-in C57BL/6 mice were cocultured with

www.aacrjournals.org

Renca tumor cells and irradiated CD11cþ cells for 72 hours.
Presence of CD4þGFPþ cells was checked by flow cytometry.
T-cells proliferation assay in vitro
About 1  105 cells per well of OVA-specific Stat3þ/þ and
Stat3/ CD8þ cells were cocultured with irradiated 5  104
CD11cþ cells in the presence of OVA peptide for 72 hours.
Eighteen hours before harvesting, cells were incubated in
medium containing 1 mCi of [methyl-3H]-thymidine (Amersham). Radioactivity was measured as counts per minutes
(cpm) on liquid scintilator (Wallac 1450 Microbeta, Perkin
Elmer).
Western blot analysis
Western blot analysis was conducted as previously
described (27).
Statistics
An unpaired t test and 2-way ANOVA were used to calculate
2-tailed P values to estimate statistical significance of differences between treatment groups. Statistically significant P
values are indicated in figures as follows: ***P < 0.001, **P <
0.01, *P < 0.05. Data were analyzed using GraphPad Prism
software.

Results
Ablating Stat3 within CD8þ cells allows in vivo
expansion and activation of infused T cells in
tumor-bearing lymphopenic host
Genetically engineering T cells prior to their infusion into
animals or patients has greatly facilitated the advancement
of adoptive T-cell transfer therapeutic modality (28). To test
whether Stat3 is a molecular target to inhibit in CD8þ T cells
before adoptive transfer, we first generated transgenic mice
lacking the Stat3 alleles in T cells. This was achieved by
crossing mice containing Stat3 alleles flanked by loxP sites
with mice carrying Cre-recombinase transgene under control of the CD4 promoter, which deletes loxP-flanked alleles
in both CD4þ and CD8þ T cells with very high efficiency.
These mice served as donors of naive T cells for adoptive
transfer into immunodeficient Rag1/ mice that lack both
T and B cells. Some of current adoptive T-cell therapy
protocols prior to T-cell infusion introduce chemo lymphodepletion alone or combined with radiation (29, 30). Adoptive transfer of Stat3/ CD8þ T cells before tumor
implantation significantly inhibited growth of poorly immunogenic B16 melanoma tumors in comparison with control
mice that received Stat3-positive T cells (Fig. 1A). In mice
receiving Stat3/ CD8þ T cells, tumor tissue was highly
infiltrated by CD8þ T cells (Fig. 1B, top). In addition to a
large increase in the total number of CD8þ T cell infiltrates,
the percentage of Trp2 antigen–specific T cells was also
increased (Fig. 1B, bottom, and Supplementary Fig. 1). To
further explore antigen-specific cytotoxic responses of transferred T cells, we conducted in vivo killing assay in Rag1/
mice bearing B16 melanoma tumor. Results from the assay
showed that Stat3/ CD8þ T-cell killing of p15E peptide–

response in vivo. To test this, we generated ovalbumin-specific
mice (CD8OVA TCR [OT-I]) with or without Stat3 gene ablation
in T cells. B16OVA-expressing tumor growth was significantly
inhibited in Rag1/ mice receiving adoptive transfer of
Stat3/ CD8þ OT-I T cells (data not shown). B16OVA
tumor–bearing mice that received Stat3/ CD8þ OT-I cells
could mount stronger antigen-specific T-cell responses after
OVA peptide restimulation than their Stat3þ/þ counterparts,
as shown by IFN-g and granzyme B ELISPOT (Fig. 1E, left and
right, respectively).
Tumor infiltration and proliferation of genetically
engineered Stat3/ CD8þ T cells in vivo
Although data shown in Figure 1B suggested that the lack of
Stat3 in CD8þ T cells leads to efficient T-cell tumor accumulation, this could be attributed to reduced tumor growth rate. To
directly assess whether inhibiting Stat3 in CD8þ T cells would
increase their ability to infiltrate tumors, we adoptively transferred Stat3þ/þ and Stat3/ OVA-specific CD8þ T cells mixed
at 1:1 ratio into the Rag1/ mice bearing B16OVA tumors. To
distinguish between the 2 populations in vivo, we labeled the
Stat3þ/þ and Stat3/ CD8þ T cells with distinct fluorescent
cell trackers before infusion into B16OVA tumor–bearing mice.
Intravital multiphoton microscopy analysis of tumors conducted at 48 and 72 hours postadoptive transfer indicated
enhanced accumulation of Stat3/ CD8þ OT-I T cells in
tumors (Fig. 2A). Flow cytometry to confirm the live microscopy imaging data showed significantly increased accumulation of Stat3/ CD8þ T cells inside the tumors after 48 hours
(Fig. 2B). This finding was further confirmed using Stat3þ/þ
and Stat3/ OVA-specific CD8þ T cells with reverse color
labeling (Fig. 1B).
Another major challenge facing adoptive T-cell therapy is
the need to expand the number of T cells ex vivo. We,
therefore, tested whether inhibiting Stat3 in transferred T
cells would allow them to proliferate in vivo in the tumorbearing hosts. Our in vivo experiments indicated that adoptively transferred Stat3/ CD8þ OT-I T cells proliferated
better both in tumor-draining and contralateral lymph
nodes (Fig. 2C). Experiments conducted in vitro confirmed
higher proliferative potential of Stat3/ OVA-specific CD8þ
cells as well as elevated IFN-g secretion after antigen-specific stimulation in the presence of tumor factors (Supplementary Fig. 2).

Targeting Stat3 systemically by sunitinib improves
T-cell therapy
Although genetic engineering of T cells prior to adoptive
transfer has been an important approach for T-cell therapy
(28), the availability of some Food and Drug Administration–
approved, small-molecule drugs with capacity to inhibit
angiogenesis, kill tumor cells, and modulate the tumor immunologic microenvironment, in part through Stat3 inhibition,
may lead to new paradigm for T-cell therapy. We therefore
tested in vitro whether sunitinib, which inhibits Stat3 (26),
could effectively inhibit the activation of Stat3 by tumorderived factors. Data shown in Figure 3A indicated that tumor
factor–induced Stat3 activation in CD8þ T cells was inhibited
by sunitinib. To assess whether sunitinib might improve
adoptively transferred CD8þ T-cell antitumor efficacy in vivo,
Rag2/ mice (Balb/c) with established syngeneic Renca
mouse RCC were given vehicle control or sunitinib 2 days
prior to T-cell transfer. Results from these experiments indicated that sunitinib treatment combined with CD8þ T-cell
adoptive transfer inhibited growth of Renca tumor significantly better than either treatment alone (Fig. 3B, left). Moreover, systemic treatment with sunitinib inhibited Stat3 activity
in tumor-infiltrating dendritic cells (DC), as shown by intracellular flow cytometry (Fig. 3B, right).
Inhibiting Stat3 activity by sunitinib led to increased tumor
infiltration and activation of the transferred CD8þ T cells in
tumor-draining lymph nodes (Fig. 3C, left and right, respectively). To assess whether the positive effects of sunitinib on
CD8þ T cells were at least partially through modulating Stat3
within CD8þ T cells, we combined sunitinib treatment with
adoptively transferred Stat3þ/þ and Stat3/ CD8þ T cells.
Subsequent analysis of CD8þ T-cell tumor infiltration and
activation suggested that systemic sunitinib treatment did
affect CD8þ T cells because treating mice receiving Stat3/
CD8þ T cells with sunitinib did not further significantly
enhance the T-cell functions (Supplementary Fig. 3).
We also combined sunitinib treatment with adoptively
transferring antigen-specific CD8þ T cells. C57BL6 mice with
progressively growing B16OVA tumor (4–6 mm in diameter)
were treated with either vehicle or sunitinib, followed by
adoptive transfer of naive OVA-specific CD8þ T cells. In mice
that received the combination of both antigen-specific T cells
and sunitinib, tumor growth was significantly reduced
(Fig. 4A). Moreover, sunitinib-treated mice showed an

increased number of activated total CD8þ T cells in tumors
(Fig. 4B). To distinguish the effect of sunitinib treatment on
the activation of host versus transferred antigen-specific T
cells, we conducted experiments similar to those shown in
Figure 4B but in GFPþ transgenic mice. Again, sunitinib
treatment caused increased infiltration of CD8þ T cells into
the tumor tissue and induced activation of both host and
transferred T cells (Fig. 4C).
In vitro analysis indicated that sunitinib can inhibit tumor
factor–induced Stat3 activity in CD8þ T cells (Fig. 3A). We

Sunitinib abrogates tumor-induced Treg cell

It has been shown that depletion of endogenous Tregs
prior to T-cell transfer can improve the outcome of T-cell
therapy (31). However, the tumor microenvironment can
continually convert non-Treg (CD4þFoxP3) T cells into
Treg (CD4þFoxP3þ) T cells even after initial depletion.

Although recent studies indicated that sunitinib treatment
diminished Treg cells in mouse tumor models and in RCC
patients (23, 25), whether sunitinib effects on Tregs were
indirect or through inhibiting Treg conversion remains
unknown. We have previously shown that sunitinib treatment was associated with a reduction in tumor Stat3 activity
and the number of Tregs in Renca murine tumor model (26).
In this study, we tested whether sunitinib, through inhibition
of Stat3 phosphorylation, hindered tumor-induced conversion of CD4þFoxP3 T cells into CD4þFoxP3þ Treg cells in
vitro and in vivo. Isolated CD4þFoxP3 (non–GFP-expressing) cells from FoxP3-GFP knock-in C57BL/6 mice that
express GFP under the control of the promoter of FoxP3
were cocultured with DCs and Renca tumor cells in the
presence of sunitinib or vehicle (DMSO). After 3 days in
culture, FoxP3 expression in CD4þ T cells was examined by
flow cytometry. In comparison with the control treatment,
sunitinib inhibited Treg conversion in a dose-dependent
manner (Fig. 5A). To evaluate the effects of sunitinib on

Stat3 signaling, we determined levels of Stat3 phosphorylation in CD4þ T cells by Western blot and flow cytometry. A
significant and dose-dependent inhibition of Stat3 activity in
CD4þ T cells treated with sunitinib was detected by both
methods (Fig. 5B, right and left, respectively).
To investigate the effect of sunitinib on Treg conversion in
vivo, sorted CD4þFoxP3 T cells from FoxP3-GFP knock-in
C57BL/6 mice were adoptively transferred into Rag1/ mice.
Mice were then challenged with B16 tumor cells. After tumors
grew 5 to 7 mm in diameter, sunitinib or control vehicle was
administered orally. To evaluate Treg conversion in tumors,
intravital multiphoton microscopy of tumors was used to
detect CD4þFoxP3þ T cells. FoxP3þ Treg cells were observed
in control group but absent in the sunitinib treatment group at
various time points (Fig. 5C). Because IVMPM evaluates only
the surface layers of the tumor tissue, we carried out immunofluorescence staining of tumor tissues, which confirmed a
reduction in CD4þFoxP3þ cells infiltrating tumors in the
sunitinib-treated group (Fig. 5D and Supplementary Fig. 3).

of various immunotherapies. For adoptive T-cell therapy, the

Targeting Stat3 in Adoptive T-Cell Antitumor Therapy

these obstacles facing adoptive T-cell therapy. We show that
genetically engineered Stat3/ CD8þ T cells can, without
any ex vivo expansion, efficiently proliferate, infiltrate, and
inhibit tumor growth. Furthermore, systemic treatment with
sunitinib, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor that affects Stat3 signaling pathway, can enhance adoptive T-cell therapy and
effectively inhibit tumor Treg conversion. These studies
provide direct evidence that blocking Stat3 in either T cells
prior to in vivo infusion or systemically in the tumor microenvironment before and/or during T-cell therapy allows in
vivo expansion and improved antitumor functions of the
transferred T cells in lymphopenic mice.
We and others have shown that Stat3 is a key oncogenic
transcription factor persistently activated in diverse cancer
cells and important for tumor cell survival. Stat3 is also
activated in tumor stromal immune cells and potently
immunosuppressive (16, 27). Multiple studies have shown
that Stat3 activity in both tumor cells and tumor-associated
myeloid cells plays a critical role in inducing immunosuppression and that targeted Stat3 gene ablation in myeloid
cells results in tumor DC activation, tumor Treg cell reduction, and heavy infiltration of CD8þ T cells in tumors, leading
to effective antitumor immune responses (4, 11). Several
recent studies further showed the feasibility of targeting
Stat3 in the tumor microenvironment to enhance various
immunotherapeutic methods (17, 32, 33). Related to current
study, it has been shown that targeting Stat3 systemically by
an experimental Jak inhibitor altered the tumor immunologic environment, leading to improved antitumor effects of
transferred CTLs (34). However, the potential direct effects
on T cells and Tregs by the Jak inhibitor were not assessed in
the study.
Our results show that ablating Stat3 in CD8þ T cells prior
to transfer allows more efficient T-cell tumor infiltration,
proliferation, and antitumor effector functions. Genetically
modifying selected T cells is a key part of current adoptive Tcell therapy, and several approaches to engineer T cells have
led to important advancement for the treatment modality
(30, 35). On the basis of our results, it may be highly desirable
to modify T cells to render the selected T cells Stat3 null
before infusion into patients. This can be achieved by
transducing T cells with retroviral and possibly other vectors
encoding either Stat3 siRNA or dominant-negative Stat3
mutant. Furthermore, it is likely that additionally silencing/inhibiting Stat3 in the genetically engineered T cells
with the capacity to home into specific tumor sites and/or
antitumor properties will improve current T-cell therapeutic

approaches. The improvements can possibly include shortened time for ex vivo expansion, resistance to the tumor
immunosuppressive effects, and better antitumor effector
functions.
Combining immunotherapy with other anticancer therapeutic modalities can potentiate its antitumor activity by
multiple mechanisms, including induced lymphodepletion,
activation of antigen-presenting cells, or elimination of immunosuppressive populations of cells infiltrating the tumor
microenvironment (29, 36, 37). Recent data have shown that
sunitinib can modulate immunosuppression within the tumor
microenvironment by decreasing MDSCs and Tregs (22, 23, 25,
26). Furthermore, we have shown that inhibition of Stat3
signaling by sunitinib is a mechanism for this activity that
leads to a reduction in angiogenesis, increased apoptosis, and
decreased tumor growth (26). Our results suggest that Stat3
activity not only is important for direct RCC response to
sunitinib through apoptosis but is also involved in the regulation of DC activation, MDSC infiltration, and Treg accumulation in the tumor tissue. Systemic treatment of RCC and
melanoma in immunodeficient mice combined with adoptive
transfer of naive CD8þ T cells significantly inhibited their
growth. Furthermore, adoptive transfer of Stat3-negative
CD8þ T cells enhanced the antitumor responses, indicating
the importance of inhibition of Stat3 signaling in all compartments of immune system.
Sunitinib treatment significantly improved antitumor
responses with adoptive transfer of antigen-specific CD8þ
T cells. This observation is in agreement with studies by
Ozao-Choy et al., who showed that sunitinib improved
antitumor responses when using tumor-specific CD4þ T
cells (25). Released factors such as TGF-b can convert
Th1 CD4þ T cells into Tregs, which actively suppress antitumor immune response (38). In this report, we show that
sunitinib treatment inhibits Stat3 phosphorylation and
abrogates tumor microenvironment-induced conversion of
CD4þ cells into Tregs both in vitro and in vivo. These
observations concur with recent studies that implicate
sunitinib Stat3 inhibition in the reduction of Tregs at the
tumor site (25, 39) and provide a potential mechanism
whereby Tregs not only are depleted by Stat3 inhibition
but their conversion is also blocked.
Enthusiasm for adoptive T-cell therapy remains high, and
as we better understand how to generate T cells with
improved specificity, durability, and cytotoxicity, we must
also determine appropriate and clinically feasible methods
to address immunosuppression within the tumor microen-

enhance adoptive T-cell therapy, at least partially, through
the inhibition of Stat3 signaling, with subsequent reversal of
immunosuppression at the tumor site. These results present
a paradigm that may be used in the clinic: blocking Stat3 in T
