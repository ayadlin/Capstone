Abstract
Cancer cells are characterized by the ability to grow in an
anchorage-independent manner. The activity of the nonreceptor tyrosine kinase, focal adhesion kinase (FAK), is
thought to contribute to this phenotype. FAK localizes in focal
adhesion plaques and has a role as a scaffolding and signaling
protein for other adhesion molecules. Recent studies show a
strong correlation between increased FAK expression and
phosphorylation status and the invasive phenotype of aggressive human tumors. PF-562,271 is a potent, ATP-competitive,
reversible inhibitor of FAK and Pyk2 catalytic activity with
a IC50 of 1.5 and 14 nmol/L, respectively. Additionally,
PF-562,271 displayed robust inhibition in an inducible cellbased assay measuring phospho-FAK with an IC50 of 5 nmol/L.
PF-562,271 was evaluated against multiple kinases and
displays >100 selectivity against a long list of nontarget
kinases. PF-562,271 inhibits FAK phosphorylation in vivo in a
dose-dependent fashion (calculated EC 50 of 93 ng/mL, total)
after p.o. administration to tumor-bearing mice. In vivo
inhibition of FAK phosphorylation (>50%) was sustained for >4
hours with a single p.o. dose of 33 mg/kg. Antitumor efficacy
and regressions were observed in multiple human s.c.
xenograft models. No weight loss, morbidity, or mortality
were observed in any in vivo experiment. Tumor growth
inhibition was dose and drug exposure dependent. Taken
together, these data show that kinase inhibition with an ATPcompetitive small molecule inhibitor of FAK decreases the
phospho-status in vivo, resulting in robust antitumor activity.

Introduction
A hallmark of cancer is the ability for cells to proliferate
regardless of adhesion to a substrate (1). Mounting evidence
suggests that focal adhesion kinase (FAK) plays an essential role in
the ability of cells to grow in an adhesion-independent manner (2).
FAK is a nonreceptor tyrosine kinase that transduces signaling
from a diverse group of stimuli (e.g., integrins, cytokines, chemokines, and growth factors) to control a variety of cellular pathways
and processes, including cell proliferation, migration, morphology,
and cell survival (3, 4). Consistent with these cellular functions and

implicating the importance of FAK in tumor progression,
exogenous expression of the tumor suppressor gene PTEN results
in dephosphorylation of FAK (5). FAK is found at elevated levels in
most human cancers, particularly as cancers transform into highly
invasive metastases (6). This makes disruption of FAK activity and
function an exciting and novel approach to targeted anticancer
therapy against virtually any solid tumor (7).
FAK is localized at sites of contact with the extracellular matrix
(ECM; focal adhesions) and serves to transduce signals from
integrin receptors and enhance signaling by growth factor
receptors (8, 9). The transmembrane integrin receptors are
important for linking the ECM proteins with the cellular actin
cytoskeleton and the nucleus to regulate cell morphology, tissue
architecture, and attachment-induced gene expression (10). FAK
activity enhances signaling of many receptor tyrosine kinases that
are themselves viable anticancer targets, such as insulin-like
growth factor receptor (IGF-IR) (11), the erbB family (12), and
angiogenesis receptors (13). Given that integrin signaling is
mediated through FAK catalytic activity (14), a small molecule
inhibitor of FAK could be considered a nonantibody approach to
inhibit integrin signaling. Interestingly, loss of FAK activity using
conditional knockout mice disrupted angiogenesis in late-stage
embryos but did not affect vasculogenesis (15), suggesting that FAK
inhibition may also result in an antiangiogenic effect (16). These
data are consistent with the role of FAK in signal transduction of
known angiogenic integrins as well as the fact that overexpression
of FAK in endothelial cells promotes angiogenesis (17, 18).
Pyk2 is the only other member of the FAK family with 48%
amino acid identity (19). However, the role of Pyk2 in tumorigenesis is not well-established. Although FAK is expressed in most
tissues and cell types, Pyk2 seems to have more limited tissue
distribution (hematopoietic cells, vascular smooth muscle, endothelium, spleen, kidney, and central nervous system; ref. 19). Unlike
the lethal FAK knockout (20), Pyk2 knockout mice develop
normally except that they exhibit defective macrophage migration
and have increased bone density (21). Interestingly and importantly
for prostate and breast cancer patients with or without bone
metastasis, dual FAK/Pyk2 inhibitors resulted in prevention of
bone resorption and increased bone formation while inhibiting the
growth of bone metastases (22, 23).1
PF-562,271 represents an unprecedented approach to treating
cancer through FAK inhibition. Moreover, FAK inhibition is

expected to affect both tumor and endothelial cells. With its novel
target and dual antitumor and antiangiogenesis mechanisms of
action, PF-562,271 offers the potential to enhance the current
armamentarium of cancer therapeutics as a single agent or in
combination with cytotoxics or other targeted agents.

Materials and Methods
Chemical synthesis. PF-562,271 was identified through a combination of
rational design, high throughput kinase activity screens, and structureactivity relationships as previously described (24).
Expression. The FAK catalytic domain (FAKcd) protein used for
crystallization experiments was expressed with an NH2-terminal 6XHistag and comprises residues 410 to 689 after thrombin cleavage (FAK
sequence with residue 410 changed from a Pro to a Gly). FAKcd was
expressed in Sf9 insect cells using the pFastBac expression vector
(Invitrogen Corp.).
Purification. Cell paste was resuspended in 400 mL buffer A [50 mmol/L
HEPES (pH 7.0), 500 mmol/L NaCl, 0.1 mmol/L Tris (2-carboxy-ethyl)phosphin-HCl (TCEP), and Complete, EDTA-free protease inhibitor cocktail
tablets (Roche Diagnostics)]. The cells were lysed and cell debris was
removed by centrifugation at 4jC for 35 min at 28,000  g. The supernatant
was incubated with Ni-NTA Superflow (QIAGEN GmbH) with gentle rocking
at 4jC for 1 h and then subjected to centrifugation at 700  g in a swinging
bucket rotor. The supernatant was discarded and the Ni-NTA resin
was resuspended in 20.0 mL of buffer A and transferred to an XK-16
column connected to a fast protein liquid chromatography (GE Healthcare
Bio-Sciences Corp.). The Ni-NTA resin was washed with five-column
volumes of buffer A and eluted off the column with a step gradient of
buffer A containing 300 mmol/L imidazole. The eluted fractions were
exchanged into buffer B [25 mmol/L HEPES (pH 7.0), 400 mmol/L NaCl, and
0.1 mmol/L TCEP]. After buffer exchange, high-activity thrombin (Calbiochem of Merck KGaA) was added to the pooled fractions at a 1:300 (w/w)
ratio and incubated overnight at 13jC to remove the NH2-terminal His-tag.
The reaction mixture was loaded back onto the Ni-NTA column equilibrated
with buffer A, and the flow-through was collected. The flow-through was
concentrated down to 1.7 mL and loaded directly onto a Superdex 200
HiLoad 16/60 prep grade column (GE Healthcare Bio-Sciences Corp.)
equilibrated with buffer C [10 mmol/L HEPES (pH 7.5), 200 mmol/L
ammonium sulfate, and 0.1 mmol/L TCEP]. The protein was stored frozen
in aliquots at 80jC in buffer C.
Crystallization. The FAKcd/PF-562,271 complex was crystallized using
hanging drop vapor diffusion in 24-well VDX plates (Hampton Research).
The protein was mixed 1:1 with reservoir solution containing 15%
polyethylene glycol 8K, 0.1 mol/L HEPES (pH 7.5), 0.2 mol/L (NH4)2SO4.
The concentration of PF-562,271 was 10 Amol/L. Crystals grew to 0.08 
0.08  0.02 mm over 3 to 5 d.
Data collection and structure determination. X-ray diffraction data
for FAKcd/PF-562,271 was collected on a FRE rotating anode X-ray
generator outfitted with a HTC image plate detector system (Rigaku/
MSC, Inc.). After transfer to a cryoprotectant consisting of 80% reservoir
solution + 20% ethylene glycol + 10 Amol/L compound, crystals were flash
cooled in liquid nitrogen. All images were processed using HKL2000 (25).
Data statistics are reported in Supplementary Data.
The FAKcd/PF-562,271 structure was determined by the molecular
replacement method, using the program MOLREP (26), using as a search
model a FAKcd monomer structure derived from an ongoing structurebased drug design program. Refinement of the structures was performed
using the program REFMAC (27), Arp/Warp (28, 29), and Xfit (30). Various
data, coordinate, and map manipulations were performed using programs
from the CCP4 suite (29).
Recombinant kinase assay and enzyme kinetics. All in vitro assays
used for identification of a FAK inhibitor have been previously described
(31). Briefly, purified-activated FAK kinase domain (amino acid 410–689)
was reacted with 50 Amol/L ATP and 10 Ag per well of a random peptide
polymer of Glu and Tyr, p(Glu/Tyr), in kinase buffer [50 mmol/L HEPES
(pH 7.5), 125 mmol/L NaCl, and 48 mmol/L MgCl2] for 15 min.

Cancer Res 2008; 68: (6). March 15, 2008

Phosphorylation of p(Glu/Tyr) was challenged with serially diluted
compound at 1/2-Log concentrations starting at a top concentration of
1 Amol/L. Each concentration was tested in triplicate. Phosphorylation of
p(Glu/Tyr) was detected with a general antiphospho-tyrosine (PY20)
antibody followed by horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated goat antimouse IgG antibody. HRP substrate was added, and absorbance readings
at 450 nm were obtained after addition of stop solution (2 mol/L H2SO4).
IC50 values were determined using the Hill-Slope Model. Broad kinase
selectivity profiling was performed in house and by using the
KinaseProfiler Selectivity Screening Service available through UpState
Biotechnology.2
Cell-based FAK phosphorylation assay. The GeneSwitch Inducible
System from Invitrogen was used for the cell assay (32). Stable A431
epithelial carcinoma clones were generated to express either wild-type V5tagged FAK protein or mutant FAKY397F V5-tagged protein under the
inducible regulation of mifepristone. Stable clones were grown in DMEM
10% fetal bovine serum, 750 Ag/mL Zeocin, and 50 Ag/mL Hygromycin. One
day before running the FAK cell ELISA, A431 FAK wild-type cells were
seeded in growth medium in 96-well U-bottomed plates. After 4 to 6 h at
37jC, 5% CO2, FAK expression was induced with 0.1 nmol/L mifepristone.
Uninduced controls were included. Anti-V5– or anti-FAK–coated plates
were blocked in 3% bovine serum albumin (BSA)/0.5%Tween for 1 h at
room temperature. Cells were treated with 1/2-Log serial dilutions starting
at a top concentration of 1 Amol/L for 30 min at 37jC, 5% CO2. Lysates from
cells treated with indicated concentrations of compound were prepared in
lysis buffer [50 mmol/L Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 1% NP40, 0.25% Na-deoxycholate,
150 mmol/L NaCl, 1 mmol/L EDTA, 1 mmol/L Na3VO4, 1 mmol/L NaF, and
protease inhibitors] and transferred to the anti-V5– or anti-FAK–coated
plates to capture total induced or total FAK protein. Antiphosphospecific
FAKY397 was used to detect autophosphorylated FAKY397 followed by
secondary reporter antibody. HRP substrate was added, and plates were
read at 450 nmol/L. IC50 values were determined using the Hill-Slope Model.
3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assays were
performed to determine compound cytotoxicity.
Animals for in vivo studies. Athymic female mice (CD-1 Nu/Nu, f20
grams) were used for all in vivo studies. Mice were obtained from Charles
River Laboratories and housed in specific pathogen-free conditions,
according to the guidelines of the Association for the Assessment and
Accreditation for Laboratory Animal Care, International. All in vivo studies
were carried out under approved institutional experimental animal care and
use protocols.
Ex vivo ELISA. Female athymic mice were injected with 1  106 U87MG
human glioblastoma cells on day 1. On day 9, when tumors were f300
mm3, the mice received compound or vehicle (5% Gelucire 44/14 in sterile
water; Gattefossé) p.o. For pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD)
analysis, blood and tumor samples were collected from each animal (n > 4
mice per group per time point) into heparinized vacutainers and liquid N2,
respectively, at the indicated times postdose. Blood and tumors were
harvested for evaluation of drug levels and tumor-associated phospho-FAK
and total FAK. Plasma concentrations of PF-562,271 were determined using
reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography with mass
spectrometric (MS/MS) detection. Tumors were homogenized in 1 mL
lysis buffer per 200-mg tumor [lysis buffer: 50 mmol/L HEPES (pH 7.5), 150
mmol/L NaCl, 1.5 mmol/L MgCl2, 1 mmol/L EDTA, 1% Glycerol, 1% Triton
X-100, 1.6 mmol/L Na3VO4, 10 mmol/L NaF, 25 mg/L Soy Bean Trypsin
Inhibitor, EDTA-free complete Protease Inhibitor Tablets], spun 5 min at
14,000 rpm, and the supernatant were aliquoted to 96-well polypropylene
plates on dry ice. Total protein concentration was determined using BSA
protein assay (Pierce). Ninety-six–well goat-anti-rabbit ReactiBind plates
(Pierce) were blocked with 100 AL per well cold blocking buffer (TBS, 0.1%
Tween 20, and 3% BSA) for 60 min on a plate shaker at room temperature.
The blocking buffer was replaced with 0.5 Ag anti-pFAK397 in 100 AL cold
blocking buffer per well and incubated for 60 min at room temperature with

agitation. Plates were washed with TBS-T (TBS, 0.1% Tween 20) before
addition of tumor lysate (500 Ag total protein in lysis buffer without
protease inhibitors) and incubated 2 h at room temperature with agitation.
Captured pFAK was detected with anti-FAK Ab and then incubated with
15 ng HRP–anti-IgG per well (in blocking buffer) for 30 min at room
temperature. The plates were washed as above and phosphotyrosine
quantitated using 3, 3¶, 5, 5¶-tetramethylbenzidine as described above. All
phosho-FAK inhibition data are analyzed by comparing PF-562,271–treated
tumors to vehicle-treated tumors.
Prediction of efficacious concentration. Blood and tumor samples
were collected at each time point postadministration of PF-562,271 for
determination of blood drug concentration and FAK phosphotyrosine
reduction. The relationship between compound concentration and FAK
phosphotyrosine reduction has been explored in pharmacologic models
(tumor-bearing athymic mice) with pooled experimental data from multiple
individual studies. FAK phosphotyrosine reduction correlates well with
blood concentrations of PF-562,271 in athymic mice and follows a simple
Emax pharmacodynamic model:
Emax  C
E¼
EC50 þ C
where E is the measured response (FAK phosphorylation reduction), E max
is the maximum response, EC 50 is the concentration of PF-562,271 required
for half-maximal reduction of FAK phosphorylation, and C is the blood
concentration of PF-562,271.
Tumor growth inhibition studies. All tumor cell lines were obtained
from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) and propagated by
standard tissue culture procedures in the medium suggested by ATCC.
Exponentially growing cells were trypsinized and resuspended in sterile PBS
and inoculated s.c. (1  106 cells per mouse in 200 AL) into the right flank of
mice. Animals bearing tumors of f150 mm3 in size were divided into
groups receiving either vehicle (5% Gelucire) or PF-562,271 (diluted in
vehicle), and dosed by p.o. gavage. Animal body weight and tumor
measurements were obtained every 2 d. Tumor volume (mm3) was
measured with Vernier calipers and calculated using the formula: length
(mm)  width (mm)  width (mm)  0.5. Percent growth inhibition was
calculated as previously described (33). For all tumor growth inhibition
experiments, 8 to 10 mice per dose group were used. A Student’s t test was
used to determine the P value.
Microscopy and immunohistochemistry of tumor apoptosis and
microvascular density. Mice bearing H125 tumors were treated for 3 d
with PF-562,271 (12–50 mg/kg, twice daily, p.o.). For microvascular density
analysis, mice bearing U87MG tumors were used and treated for 3 d with a
C4 sulfone derivative of PF-562,271 (50 mg/kg, daily, p.o.). After treatment,
tumors were excised and quick frozen in OCT medium. Seven-micrometer
sections were cut and processed for immunohistochemical detection of
apoptosis using a commercially available terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase–mediated dUTP nick-end (TUNEL) kit (ApopTag; Millipore) or
rat antimurine endothelial MECA32 Ab (antiendoglin; PharMingen). Tissue
sections were counter stained with hematoxylin or methyl green and
examined using a Zeiss Axiophot microscope at 20 with a reticule grid. All
discreet, positively stained apoptotic cells or vascular profiles, with or
without lumina, were counted in 10 (200) fields from multiple sections of
each tumor. Fields were randomly chosen throughout the entire section. For
each time point and dose, four mice were evaluated. A Student’s t test was
used to determine the P value.

Results
Synthesis and physical chemical properties. PF-562,271 is a
methane sulfonamide diaminopyrimidine that is Rule of 5
compliant, demonstrating favorable physical chemical properties
(Fig. 1). X-ray crystallographic analysis confirms that PF-562,271
binds in the ATP-binding cleft of FAK, forming two of the three
‘‘canonical’’ H-bonds between the inhibitor and main-chain atoms
in the kinase hinge region (Fig. 1B; for crystallographic details, see

www.aacrjournals.org

Supplementary Materials). The amino-oxindole moiety extends out
from the active site cleft along the hinge region backbone, where
the oxygen atom forms a hydrogen bond to the side chain of Arg
426. The amino-methyl pyridinyl sulfonamide group projects out
from the active site toward the activation loop region, forming
interactions with residues in the ‘‘Asp-Phe-Gly (DFG) motif ’’ of FAK
and inducing the formation of a short stretch of a-helix including
the residues around the ‘‘DFG motif ’’ (Fig. 1C). The primary driver
for this seems to be the favorable H-bonding interaction that is
established between one of the sulfonamide oxygen atoms and the
backbone NH of D564. Consistent with the fact that the FAKcd
used for X-ray crystallography was uniformly nonphosphorylated
(data not shown), the activation loop region of the kinase (residues
571–584) is completely disordered.
Inhibition of FAK tyrosine kinase activity, selectivity, and
autophosphorylation in intact cells. PF-562,271 is a potent ATPcompetitive, reversible inhibitor of FAK and Pyk2 kinase, with a IC50
of 1.5 nmol/L (0.7 ng/mL) and 13 nmol/L (7 ng/mL), respectively
(Table 1). This compound shows Michaelis-Menton kinetics,
consistent with it being an ATP-competitive and reversible inhibitor
of the enzyme (Fig. 1D). PF-562,271 was evaluated in a number of
kinase screens and panels and displays >100 selectivity against all
tested enzymes, except for some cyclin-dependent kinase (cdk)
cyclin complexes (Table 1). Although PF-562,271 was shown to be a
30- to 120-nmol/L (15.2 to 60.1 ng/mL) inhibitor of cdk2/E, cdk5/
p35, cdk1/B, and cdk3/E in recombinant enzyme assays, in cellbased assays evaluating the role of cdks, a 48-hour exposure of
3.3 Amol/L PF-562,271 was required to alter cell cycle progression
(Fig. 2). Furthermore, confirmatory studies failed to detect any
PF-562,271 inhibitory activity against cdk5/p35 enzyme. The cellbased assay exploits the mechanism of the GeneSwitch system to
exogenously control the expression and subsequent phosphorylation of FAK and the kinase-dependent autophosphorylation site at
residue Y397. PF-562,271 is potent in an inducible cell-based assay
measuring phospho-FAK with a IC50 of 5 nmol/L (2.5 ng/mL;
Table 1). Comparative cell assays suggest that PF-562,271 is f4-fold
less potent for Pyk2 than FAK (data not shown). These cell-based
data show an even greater selectivity for FAK (and Pyk2) relative to
other kinase targets (e.g., cdks). Therefore, PF-562,271 is an excellent
molecule to inhibit FAK activity in animal models of disease.
Inhibition of FAK phosphorylation in tumors. After demonstration of FAK inhibition and selectivity in vitro, the ability of
PF-562,271 to modulate FAK activity in vivo was evaluated using
tumor-bearing mice. As shown in Fig. 3A and B, p.o. administration
of PF-562,271 to tumor-bearing mice inhibited FAK phosphorylation in tumors in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Percent
inhibition of phosphorylated FAK is relative to vehicle-treated
control animals. Maximal pFAK inhibition of 78% was achieved
1 hour after a 33 mg/kg p.o. dose. However, in vivo inhibition of
FAK phosphorylation was sustained (>50%) for >4 hour with this
single p.o. dose. By contrast, although a 10 mg/kg dose approached
a maximal inhibition of 70%, >50% pFAK inhibition was only
sustained for <2 hour. FAK phosphorylation inhibition relative to
total blood concentration of PF-562,271 resulted in a calculated
EC 50 of 93 ng/mL (total; Fig. 3B).
Evaluation of in vivo efficacy, C max, or C ave. In an effort to
better understand the pharmacologic inhibition of FAK and the
relationship to tumor growth inhibition, experiments were
designed to evaluate different dosing regimens, i.e., daily dosing,
twice daily dosing, and continuous coverage using osmotic minipumps. These experiments allow the comparison between C max,

C ave, and C min and the relationship to attaining maximal efficacy,
providing the critical PK/PD linkage of FAK inhibition to antitumor
activity in these preclinical models. A direct comparison between
daily and twice daily dose while keeping the total daily dose
equivalent provides either a high C max with 4 hours of >50% target
inhibition or a lower C max but extended target inhibition (Fig. 3C;
Table 2). Whereas the 50 mg/kg daily dose resulted in a
C max of 157 ng/mL ( free), the corresponding tumor growth
inhibition was only 45% with 37% inhibition of pFAK after 15 days
of dosing in the PC-3M human prostate xenograft model. Contrast
these results to the 61% tumor growth inhibition and 27% pFAK
inhibition observed in the same model for the same number of
dosing days while splitting the dose to provide two daily doses of
25 mg/kg (still 50 mg/kg/day) and only reaching a C max of 25 ng/mL.
To further evaluate extended coverage/inhibition of the target,
osmotic mini-pumps loaded with PF-562,271 were implanted into
tumor-bearing mice (Fig. 3D; Table 2). In this case, the mini-pumps

Cancer Res 2008; 68: (6). March 15, 2008

only maintained 0.7 ng/mL ( free) blood levels but did so
continuously for 24 hours. This results in a lower overall inhibition
of FAK phosphorylation in tumors but for extended periods of
time compared with p.o. dosing (Table 2). Importantly, the tumor
growth inhibition using mini-pumps was identical to the 50 mg/kg
twice daily dosing regimen that resulted in a C max of 273 ng/mL
( free; Fig. 3D).
Breadth and amount of antitumor activity with p.o.
dosing. The pharmacokinetics, inhibition of phosphorylated
FAK, and antitumor efficacy of PF-562,271 was evaluated in
the following human s.c. xenograft models: PC-3M (prostate),
BT474 (breast), BxPc3 (pancreatic), LoVo (colon), U87MG
(glioblastoma), and H125 and H460 (lung; Table 2). Dosedependent tumor growth inhibition was observed in all models.
Maximum tumor inhibition for PC-3M, BT474, BxPc3, and LoVo
ranged from 78% to 94% inhibition for the group with
regressions in up to 50% of a given dose group (Table 2).

Pharmacology of a FAK Inhibitor, PF-562,271

Regressions were observed in PC-3M, BT474, BxPc3, and LoVo
models at doses of 25 to 50 mg/kg twice daily, corresponding
to C max ( free) ranges of 78 to 885 ng/mL, C ave ( free) of 14 to
40 ng/mL, and inhibition of phospho-FAK of 31% to 76% for
>4 hours. No weight loss, morbidity, or death was observed in
any tumor growth inhibition (TGI) experiment (up to 50 mg/kg
twice daily  29 days or 100 mg/kg daily  25 days). All data
are based on 6 to 10 animals per dose, and experiments were
completed at least twice. After dosing, animals were euthanized,
blood and tumor were analyzed for drug concentration (PK), and
tumors were evaluated for phospho-FAK (PD).
In vivo mechanism of action. The primary mechanism by
which FAK inhibits tumor growth is believed to be through the
induction of anoikis (i.e., anchorage-dependent apoptosis). To test
whether inhibition of FAK activity in tumors induces apoptosis,
mice bearing H125 lung xenografts were treated with PF-562,271
twice daily for 3 or 10 days to evaluate apoptosis or tumor growth
inhibition, respectively. Apoptosis cannot be evaluated at the end
of TGI experiments because tumors are too necrotic to obtain
reliable staining data. At a dose of 25 mg/kg, apoptosis was 2-fold
greater in treated tumors compared with vehicle-treated control
tumors on day 3 (Fig. 4). There was no increase in apoptosis at
doses of 12.5 mg/kg at day 3, although tumor growth was
inhibited 44% by day 10. FAK inhibition may also result in an
antiangiogenic effect due to its linkage to av integrin signal
transduction. As shown in Fig. 4D, U87MG tumors treated with a
PF-562,271 derivative (50 mg/kg, twice daily, p.o.) resulted in
f50% decrease in microvascular density after only 3 days of
treatment.

Discussion
In this report, we characterize the pharmacology of a selective
small molecule inhibitor of FAK, PF-562,271. These preclinical
pharmacology studies helped determine the appropriate utility of
this compound resulting in the advance to human clinical trails for
the treatment of cancer. PF-562,271 has been administered to >60
patients in the phase I setting. Although no objective responses
were reported, several patients have experienced prolonged disease
stabilization of 6 months or longer, including some beyond 1 year.
These include patients with a variety of tumor types including
sarcoma, renal, lung, lacrimal, and prostate cancers. Moreover,
patients have shown a metabolic response by 18 F-fluoro-2deoxyglucose–positron emission tomography (PET) scan criteria.
For example, one patient with stage IV ovarian cancer showed a
metabolic response by PET scan criteria, with a reduction in the
standardized uptake value signal of a splenic metastasis by 46%,
2 weeks after taking PF-562,271 (34).
Crystallographic analysis of PF-562,271 with the catalytic domain
of FAK combined with the Scatchard analysis confirms that the
compound binds in the ATP-binding pocket consistent with it
being an ATP-competitive and reversible inhibitor of FAK (35). The
most remarkable feature of the crystal structure of FAKcd/PF562,271 is the conformation of the residues comprising the
conserved ‘‘DFG motif,’’ which adopt a helical conformation. This
helical conformation is driven primarily by interactions between
the methane sulfonamide moiety and the backbone NH of Asp 564,
as well as hydrophobic interactions between the side chain of Leu
567 and the pyridinyl moiety of PF-562,271. In addition to
perturbing the conformation of the activation loop, this helix
forces the side chain of Asp 564 upwards and away from the ATPbinding cleft, where it interacts with the conserved Lys 454-Glu 471
salt bridge. This Lys-Glu salt bridge is a key feature of activated
protein kinases, correctly orienting the ‘‘C-helix’’ of the kinase and
establishing the proper orientation of the NH2- and COOH-terminal
loops for catalysis. Because Asp 564 is believed to play an
important role in catalysis by coordinating a Mg2+ ion and helping
to stabilize the h- and g- phosphates of Mg-ATP (36), the
repositioning of the Asp 564 side chain would presumably abolish
ATP binding by removing this critical interaction. In addition to
increased potency, this sulfonamide interaction pocket may explain
to some extent the exquisite selectivity of PF-562,271 for FAK
because the activation loop region is the most plastic and
idiosyncratic structure in the otherwise well-conserved protein
kinase topology. Finally, although helical segments in the activation
loop region have been seen in other protein kinases, including
CDK2, Src, Hck, MAP/ERK kinase (MAPK), and epidermal growth
factor receptor (EGFR; refs. 37–39), the structure reported here is
the first to include directly the catalytically important ‘‘DFG motif.’’
It will be interesting to determine if the DFG helix observed here
functions in an analogous manner to these other kinases in
contributing to an autoinhibited state of the enzyme.
PF-562,271 showed selectivity against a wide panel of kinases, as
well as nanomolar potency in a cell-based assay of FAK activity.
There have been previous reports of inhibitors with cross-reactivity
against FAK, but what distinguishes PF-562,271 from these other
inhibitors is the potency for FAK and the selectivity against other
kinases, especially IGF-IR, IR, and src (40). The moderate activity of
this compound against some cdks in recombinant kinase assays
was insufficient to translate into cellular effects expected of a cdk
inhibitor (41). Given that the no-effect concentration for inhibition

in vivo and in vitro IC50 (in vivo Cmax, 69 nmol/L; in vitro Cmax,
1 nmol/L), PF-562,271 is not considered to be a pharmacologically
relevant inhibitor of cdks in vitro or in vivo. When activated, FAK
becomes phosphorylated at Y397, which is a binding site for src; thus,
both catalytically active molecules are colocalized within focal

adhesions (42). Src, FAK, and integrin signaling have long been
implicated in cancer biology. Given the catalytic capacity of both FAK
and src (43), it is imperative that PF-562,271 is selective for FAK to
accurately elucidate the role of FAK and correctly interpret antitumor
effects. Because PF-562,271 (and a closely related compound, PF573,228) showed substantial kinase selectivity for FAK compared with

other kinases, it is now possible to dissect the specific role of FAK ATP
catalysis directly (31). More importantly, PF-562,271 has the appropriate pharmacologic properties for clinical testing in humans. This
molecule is not only an excellent tool for understanding the role of
FAK in vitro and in vivo but also the appropriate molecule to test the
hypothesis in the clinical disease setting.
A rigorous in vivo PK/PD evaluation was completed for PF562,271. The compound is well-absorbed with maximal blood levels
occurring between 30 minutes and 2 hours after p.o. administration. Maximal pharmacodynamic modulation occurs simultaneously with maximal pharmacokinetic exposure in the blood regardless
of dose or number of repeated doses. Measured PK is accurately
modeled using in vitro and in vivo calculation of absorption,
distribution, metabolism, and excretion, demonstrating a wellbehaved and predictable in vivo pharmacology.
The ability to modulate FAK phosphorylation after p.o.
administration of PF-562,271 was evaluated in multiple tumor
types, but for routine assessment, the U87MG model was used.
This was due to the robust and consistent growth of the tumor,
allowing for an efficient drug discovery platform, as well as the
elevated expression and activation of FAK in these tumor
xenografts. However, inhibition of phospho-FAK was observed in
every tumor model to varying degrees. TGI in the nonclinical

models was shown with both intermittent and sustained
exposures. It is interesting and clinically relevant to note that
transient maximal inhibition of FAK activity never provided the
greatest antitumor efficacy. This is clearly evident when twice
daily dosing is compared with daily dosing and most strikingly
shown when mini-pumps are used. Twice daily dosing and minipump experiments (steady state concentration) resulted in
greater TGI in multiple models compared with daily dosing
(equivalent total daily dose), suggesting C ave and the time above
the C ave are more relevant to efficacy than C max. These data
clearly show that the area under the curve for target modulation
and not maximal inhibition yields maximal antitumor efficacy.
This characteristic has been observed with other receptor
tyrosine kinase inhibitors (33). The mini-pump model also better
mimics the clinical dosing regimen, where repeated dosing will
result in a sustained steady-state exposure of the compound over
the entire dosing period (34).
PF-562,271 was evaluated in multiple tumor xenograft models to
show breadth of activity, although these models do not predict
clinical efficacy nor do they adequately represent the clinical tumor
types. The xenograft models were chosen due to increased FAK
expression and/or FAK activation (44–46). It is important to note
that although FAK expression and activation are elevated in these

models, tumor growth in these models is not primarily driven by
FAK expression nor due to activating mutations in FAK. Regardless
of the multitude of activated pathways (e.g., EGFR, PDGFR, VEGFR,
and src) and disrupted/inactive tumor suppressors (e.g., PTEN), PF562,271 showed robust antitumor activity as a single agent in every
model at well-tolerated doses achieving low to moderate blood
levels. Moreover, regressions were observed in most models with up
to 50% of a dose group resulting in regressions. This level of
antitumor activity was established for repeated dosing of up to 29
days with no decrease in body weight or animal activity,
demonstrating that PF-562,271 is very well-tolerated and potent
in these models.
The function of FAK as a transducer of integrin engagement is
well-established (3). Cells detached from matrix in vitro undergo
anoikis (attachment-mediated apoptosis) with a concomitant
decrease in FAK activity (1). To evaluate the molecular changes
associated with the inhibition of FAK in vivo and evaluate a
potential mechanism behind the dramatic antitumor efficacy, we
measured the amount of apoptosis after treatment with PF562,271. Consistent with the association of FAK signaling and
apoptosis (47), tumors had a significant increase in apoptotic
bodies after p.o. administration of PF-562,271 when compared
with vehicle-treated animals. Increased apoptosis was observed

with increased individual and cumulative dose, aligned with
pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic modulation of FAK
activity. Interestingly, on favorable sections, apoptotic vascular
cells could be identified (data not shown). Moreover, microvascular density was decreased by 50% in U87 tumors after FAK
inhibition, consistent with the linkage of FAK to avh integrin
signaling and previous reports of FAK expression in angiogenic
blood vessels (48). Therefore, although FAK inhibition is primarily
an antitumor approach, it should also be considered antiangiogenic. Induction of apoptosis occurred as early as 3 days of
dosing. At this time point, there is no obvious distinction in
tumor growth between vehicle- and PF-562,271–treated animals,
suggesting that apoptosis may be one of the earliest functional
changes after FAK catalytic inhibition in vivo. These results
suggest that inhibitors of FAK activity could limit tumor growth
and metastasis through induction of tumor and endothelial cell
apoptosis and inhibition of migration.
Broadly speaking, pharmacologic anticancer therapy consists of
cytotoxics and targeted agents (small molecules and biologics).
Unfortunately, the majority of patients treated with these agents
eventually progress. In addition, toxicities associated with these
agents often preclude adequate treatment. In this report, the
in vivo pharmacology of a highly selective and potent inhibitor of

FAK catalytic activity, PF-562,271, is described. The novel mode of
inhibition of FAK, characterized by the inhibitor-induced ‘‘DFG
helix,’’ resulted in profound antitumor activity across a wide variety
of tumor types while being well-tolerated. PF-562,271 showed wellbehaved pharmacology in vivo with a robust PK/PD relationship.
PF-562,271 shows the selectivity and pharmacology that has
allowed it to be a first in class inhibitor presently in clinical
testing for the treatment of cancer.
