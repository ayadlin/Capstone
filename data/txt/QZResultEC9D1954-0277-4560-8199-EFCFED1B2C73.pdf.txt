ABSTRACT
The receptor for the urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPAR) accounts
for many features of cancer progression, and is therefore considered a target for
anti-tumoral therapy. Only full length uPAR mediates tumor progression. Matrixmetallo-proteinase-12 (MMP12)-dependent uPAR cleavage results into the loss
of invasion properties and angiogenesis. MMP12 can be employed in the field of
“targeted therapies” as a biological drug to be delivered directly in patient’s tumor
mass. Endothelial Progenitor Cells (EPCs) are selectively recruited within the tumor
and could be used as cellular vehicles for delivering anti-cancer molecules. The aim
of our study is to inhibit cancer progression by engeneering ECFCs, a subset of EPC,
with a lentivirus encoding the anti-tumor uPAR-degrading enzyme MMP12. Ex vivo
manipulated ECFCs lost the capacity to perform capillary morphogenesis and acquired
the anti-tumor and anti-angiogenetic activity. In vivo MMP12-engineered ECFCs
cleaved uPAR within the tumor mass and strongly inhibited tumor growth, tumor
angiogenesis and development of lung metastasis.
The possibility to exploit tumor homing and activity of autologous MMP12engineered ECFCs represents a novel way to combat melanoma by a “personalized
therapy”, without rejection risk.
The i.v. injection of radiolabelled MMP12-ECFCs can thus provide a new
theranostic approach to control melanoma progression and metastasis.

INTRODUCTION

numerous solid tumors [1-4]. Endogenous levels of uPA
and uPAR increase with disease progression, correlate
with poor prognosis and therefore can be considered a
good target for anti-tumoral therapy [5]. This membraneassociated system has reached the higher level-ofevidence (level-1) ever for any biomarker in node-positive
breast cancer and is actually considered the main system
involved in tumor invasion and metastasis, as well as

Many data of the last decades have demonstrated
that the urokinase plasminogen activator system
(urokinase-type plasminogen activator, uPA; uPA receptor,
uPAR; uPA inhibitor type-1, PAI-1) plays a central role in
the progression, metastasis, angiogenesis and stemness of

in tumor angiogenesis [6]. uPAR is critical in invasive
properties of malignant cells since it is involved both
in extracellular matrix (ECM) degradation and in cell
adhesion through a “grip-and-go” mechanism [7]. uPAR
consists of 3 globular domains (D1, D2, D3) and is present
on the cell membrane both as a full-length and a truncated
molecule (D2+D3) which lacks the external uPA-binding
D1 domain. However, only full length uPAR is able to
mediate uPAR-dependent angiogenesis and invasion of
cancer cells. In fact, MMP12-dependent uPAR cleavage
impairs cell invasivity and angiogenesis [8-9] and uPAR
truncation by transient transfection of MMP12 in a subtype of EPC, termed “Endothelial Colony Forming Cells”
(ECFCs), resulted in inhibition of angiogenesis in vitro
and in vivo [10].
MMP12 is a metalloelastase first identified as a
protein secreted by macrophages [11]. MMP-12 shares
many features typical of MMPs including the capacity
to hydrolyze some extracellular matrix components
[12]. Even so, while MMPs commonly facilitate tumor
progression, MMP12 displays a controversial role in
cancer progression [13]. In fact, despite evidences about
correlation of tumor MMP12 with poor prognosis in
several tumors [14-16], there are growing evidences about
the “protective role” of MMP12, in tumor progression.
Notably, overexpression of MMP-12 is associated
with reduced tumor growth rates in mice, leading to a
favourable outcome [17]. Some authors showed that the
effect of MMP12 is determined by cell-type expression:
when expressed by host macrophages, it has a protective
effect, while when expressed by tumor cells it did not
[18]. These observations may possibly account for the
failure of clinical trials which rely on the use of broadrange MMP inhibitors [19-20]. Taken together these
data indicate that the role of MMP12 in human cancer
is still much discussed and that it depends on its specific
protein target and cleavage products. The anti-tumor and
anti-angiogenetic activity of MMP-12 is often ascribed
to the generation of angiostatin from plasminogen [2122]. Another potential target of MMP12 is uPAR, which
can be cleaved, thus abolishing uPA-induced endothelial
cell proliferation [23]. On these basis and on the above
mentioned results obtained in our laboratory [7-9],
MMP12 could be considered and used as a biological
drug thus opening a new anti-tumoral therapy focused on
uPAR cleavage. In this study we evaluated the possibility
to deliver MMP12 into tumor mass where it could cleave
uPAR of tumor cells and ECs.
Many studies suggest a role of Endothelial
Progenitor Cells (EPCs) in tumor vascularization and
metastasis [24]. EPCs are selectively recruited within the
tumor mass [25], the amount of circulating EPCs positively
correlates with tumor progression and their levels decrease
after chemotherapy [26]. Also, Mesenchymal stem cells
(MSCs) are able to support tumor angiogenesis and tumor
development by providing the matrix required for new
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

vessels and tumor cells scaffolding [27-28]. Due to their
capability to home within tumors, EPC and MSC can be
proposed to be used in the anti-cancer “cell therapy” as
cellular vehicles for delivering molecules inhibiting cancer
progression.
The aim of our study was directed to control the
progression of those tumor which heavily depend on
uPAR to perform invasion and metastasis. As tumor model
we utilized melanoma cell lines derived from patients with
cutaneous melanoma.
Here we used MSCs as tumoral promoters by
co-injecting them in mice together with cancer cells
to favour tumor development and showed that MSCs
promoted cancer development. On the other side, ECFCs,
engineered with a lentivirus encoding MMP12, have
been used as carriers of the anti-tumor uPAR-degrading
enzyme. We first demonstrated that intravenous injected
111
In-oxine labelled ECFCs are able to home into tumor
mass by exploiting the CXCR4/SDF1 axis. We also
demonstrated that the i.v. injected MMP12- engineered
“commandos ECFCs” were able to control melanoma
progression, angiogenesis and metastasis and, at the same
time, to cleave uPAR on tumor cells and endothelial cells
of the tumor microenvironment in human melanomas
transplanted in nude mice. Our results show that
administration of autologous 111In-oxine labelled MMP12lentiviral modified ECFCs can provide a theranostic
appoach to human melanoma progression and metastasis.

RESULTS
Role of tumor microenvironment on full length
uPAR-dependent invasivity of melanoma cells
We evaluated the correlation between uPAR
levels and the invasive properties of three different
melanoma cell lines (M14, Mewo, and A375). A375
cells displayed higher uPAR mRNA (Fig.1A) and protein
levels, as demonstrated by Western blotting analysis
and densitometric evaluation (Fig.1B) as well as higher
invasion activity compared to the other cell lines (Fig.1C).
In all the cell lines uPAR is mainly present in its biological
full length form and only a minor part is cleaved. On the
basis of these results, we chose A375 melanoma cells to
perform the following experiments. The invasive property
of melanoma cells is mainly uPAR-dependent and it is
inhibited in the presence of anti-uPAR R3 antibody, as
demonstrated in fig 1E, pictures 1 and 2. To investigate
the influence of the tumor microenvironment on uPAR
expression and invasiveness of A375 melanoma cells
we incubated melanoma cells with CM-MSC or CMECFC and we observed an increased uPAR expression
both at mRNA and protein levels (Fig.1D). Western
blotting analysis with the anti-uPAR R4 antibody,

which recognizes both full length and truncated uPAR,
demonstrated that the molecular form of upregulated
uPAR is mainly the native D1+D2+D3 molecule (Fig.1D).
Moreover, CMs treatment increased invasive properties of
melanoma cells in an uPAR-dependent manner (Fig.1E),
since CM-induced invasion was impaired by anti-uPAR
R3 antibody. We previously demonstrated that the full
length uPAR is required to perform invasion and that
uPAR cleavage by the matrix metalloproteinase 12
(MMP12) strongly decreased uPAR-dependent invasion
of tumor cells and endothelial cells [8-10]. Therefore, we
investigated whether CMs treatment affected MMP12
synthesis and, consequently, uPAR truncation. CMMSC and CM-ECFC treatment induced MMP12 down

regulation both at mRNA and protein level (Fig.2A),
which could account for the CM-dependent up-regulation
of the full length form of uPAR (Fig.1D) and the increased
invasiveness (Fig.1E) of A375 cells. In agreement with
these observations, treatment of A375 with MMP12
blocking antibody resulted in the disappearance of uPAR
cleaved fragment and enhanced full-length uPAR (Fig.2B)
as well as A375 invasiveness (Fig 2C). We observed the
same results also with CM-treated A375 cells, in which
the treatment with anti-MMP12 antibody induced upregulation of full length uPAR and the increased invasion
(data not shown). Afterwards, we transiently transfected
A375 melanoma cells with a MMP12 cDNA containing
vector (A375-MMP12) and analyzed their biological

characteristics with respect to empty vector transfected
cells (A375-EV). MMP12 transfection was effective in
upregulating MMP12 mRNA levels and in increasing
the release of active protein into the culture medium as
revealed by Western blotting analysis and by elastin
zymography (Fig.3A). Moreover, we demonstrated that
released MMP12 was able to cleave uPAR: by incubating
standard uPAR with CM from EV transfected cells (CMA375-EV) or from MMP12 tranfected cells (CM-A375MMP12) only CM-A375-MMP12 truncated standard
uPAR (Fig.3B). At the same time transfected A375
expressed the truncated form of uPAR on their surface,
revealed by Western blotting of cell lysates with the

specific anti-uPAR R4 antibody (Fig.3C). Moreover, the
invasive property of A375-MMP12, exhibiting cleaved
uPAR, was very low as compared to Matrigel invasion
of A375-EV, which displayed full length uPAR (Fig.3D).
To further evaluate whether MMP12-mediated uPAR
cleavage is responsible for inhibition of cell invasion,
we neutralized MMP12 in A375-MMP12 cells by using
anti-MMP12 antibody. In this experimental conditions
melanoma cells expressed full length uPAR (fig. 3C) and,
at the same time, the invasion property was completely
recovered (fig.3D). On the other hand, in the presence of
irrelevant IgG A375-MMP12 cells expressed truncated
uPAR and displayed a decreased Matrigel invasion.

Notably, MMP12-transfected A375 cells were
unable to respond to CM-MSC stimulation in terms of cell
migration when compared to A375-EV. This effect was
due to the release of active MMP12 by transfected cells,
which cleaved CM-MSC-up-regulated uPAR, as showed
by Western blotting of cell lysates (Fig. 3D, pictures 5 and
6).

We evaluated the expression of SDF1/CXCR4 system in
MSCs, ECFCs and tumor cells, as shown in Fig 4. PCR
analysis revealed that MSCs expressed high level of SDF1,
ECFCs expressed the related CXCR4 receptor, while
A375 cells expressed very low levels of both CXCR4 and
SDF1 genes (Fig.4A). Incubation of A375 with CM-MSC
or CM-ECFC up-regulated the expression of SDF1 and
its receptor (Fig. 4B). These results prompted us to use: i)
MSCs as tumoral promoters by co-injecting them in mice
together with melanoma cells and ii) ECFCs as carriers of
MMP12, which can be recruited within tumors following
the chemotactic gradient of SDF1 expressed by MSCs,
normally present in tumors, but also able to up-regulate
SDF1 expression in tumor cells [35]. Before in vivo
experiments, we evaluated whether the SDF1/CXCR4dependent ECFCs recruitment into tumor mass could be an

experimentally supported possibility, by performing ECFC
in vitro chemoinvasion assay upon addition of CMs in the
lower well of the migration chamber. CMs from A375
(CM-A375), from MSCs (CM-MSC) and from a coculture
of mixed (2:1) A375 and MSCs (CM-A375/MSC) were
prepared by maintaining the cells 24h in colture medium.
As shown in Fig.4D, CM-A375 induced a small increase
of ECFCs Matrigel invasion, while CM-MSC were more
effective. This effect was further strengthened by CM of
A375/MSC co-cultures. To elucidate the involvement of
SDF1/CXCR4 system, we performed in vitro Matrigel
invasion of ECFCs after SDF1 siRNA treatment of
MSCs (Fig.4C) or in the presence of CXCR4 blocking
monoclonal antibody, taking in account for the toxic
effect of CXCR4 siRNA. As a result of both treatments,
ECFCs invasion was strongly impaired, thus indicating
that ECFCs were recruited in vitro by SDF1 released by
MSCs and also by cancer cells, as demonstrated by the
inhibition of CXCR4/SDF1 in the co-colture experiments
(Fig.4D). On the basis of these results, we investigated
the in vivo role of MSC on tumor growth by injecting
1×106 viable A375 cells alone or together with 0.5x106
MSCs into CD-1 nude (nu/nu) mice, 6 to 8 weeks old (as
described in Materials and Methods). Tumor development
was monitored at regular intervals by measuring tumor
diameters. We observed a drastic increase of tumor growth
in the presence of MSCs co-injected with tumor cells (Fig.
4E) thus confirming a protumoral role of MSCs.

In order to deliver the anti-tumoral MMP12 into the
tumor mass, we produced a lentivirus encoding MMP12
and then we infected commandos ECFCs. We obtained
engineered ECFCs able to release the relevant molecule
(ECFC-MMP12) and ECFCs containing empty vector
(ECFC-MOCK). Occurred infection was evaluated by
PCR analysis of lysates and by Western blotting of the
medium. As shown in Fig.5A ECFC-MMP12 expressed
higher levels of MMP12 when compared to ECFC-MOCK,
both at gene and protein level. To study the enzymatic
activity of the released MMP12, we incubated standard
uPAR with CM ECFC-MMP12 or CM ECFC-MOCK in
the presence or absence of anti-MMP12 antibody and then
we evaluated full-length and truncated uPAR by Western
blotting analysis with anti-uPAR R4 antibody. CM ECFCMOCK did not cleave uPAR, whereas CM ECFC-MMP12
produced truncated uPAR (Fig 5B). Such truncation was
inhibited by anti-MMP12 antibody, but not by irrelevant
IgG. Moreover, MMP12 over-expression prevented
ECFCs capillary morphogenesis in a MMP12-dependent
manner, since this effect was reverted by anti-MMP12
antibody, while irrelevant IgG was ineffective (Fig.5C).
To evaluate the potential of MMP12 gene-modified
ECFCs as regard to uPAR-dependent tumor invasion and
angiogenesis we performed A375 Matrigel invasion and
capillary morphogenesis of control human microvascular
endothelial cells (HMVEC) in the presence of CM ECFCMMP12 or CM ECFC-MOCK. As shown in Fig.5D and
E, CM-ECFC-MMP12 impaired the invasion of A375 as
well as the capillary morphogenesis of HMVEC when
compared to CM-ECFC-MOCK, confirming a MMP12dependent anti-tumor and anti-angiogenic activity,
as it was reverted by anti-MMP12 antibody. In these
experiments we also demonstrated that the MMP12dependent anti-tumor and anti-angiogenetic activity were
related to the presence of the truncated form of uPAR. In
fact, the uPAR cleavage was reversed in the presence of
anti-MMP12 antibody (fig 5 D, on the right and E, on the
right).
As it is well known that MMP12 is able to cleave a
number of other substrates, we evaluated this possibility
in our experimental conditions. Some authors ascribed
the anti-angiogenic and anti-tumoral role of MMP12 to
the production of angiostatin from plasminogen. We did
not reveal any angiostatin production (data not shown).
To evaluate whether the invasion property of A375 in
the presence of CM-MMP12 was due to direct effects
of exogenously supplied MMP12 on Matrigel other than
uPAR cleavage, we incubated overnight the Matrigel
coated filter with CM ECFC-MOCK or CM ECFCMMP12 and then performed invasion assay of control

The in vivo recruitment of ECFCs into tumor
mass depends on SDF1-CXCR4 interaction.
To evaluate ECFCs homing into tumor mass in
vivo, 25 days after tumor cell implantation, when tumor
reached about 120 mm3 volume, mice were subjected to
intravenous injection of 2x106 ECFCs labelled with 60
μCi of 111In 8-oxyquinoline (oxine). After 24 hours from
administration, the scintigraphic imagine showed that
radiolabeled ECFCs were localized only in the tumor mass
(Fig 4F). To evaluate the involvement of CXCR4 in the
ECFCs recruitment, we performed the aforementioned in
vivo experiment in the presence of anti-CXCR4 antibody
to block the receptor on ECFCs cell membrane surface.
In this condition we observed the failure of ECFCs to
home into tumor mass, confirming the involvment of the
SDF1/CXCR4 system in the in vivo recruitment of ECFCs
(Fig. 4F). Homing efficiency has been evaluated using
the analysis software Vivid as described in material and
methods and expressed as uptake efficiency. We found
that ECFC intratumoral engraftment in control mice was
1.85% ± 0.2 compared to the muscle tissue controlateral
while, in the presence of  anti-CXCR4 antibody, the
uptake was significantly reduced to 0.6% ± 0.1 (Fig. 4F).

of full-length uPAR were evaluated in recovered tumor
mass by immunohistochemical analysis (Fig 6B). On
the basis of the use of FLAG expression vectors in the
construction of lentivirus, the presence of ECFCs was
estimated by using an anti-FLAG antibody while the
efficiency of uPAR cleavage was evaluated by a mAb
which recognizes only the full-length native form (uPAR
N-19, Santa Cruz). Anti-FLAG antibody stained tumors
explanted from mice injected with ECFC-MMP12 as well
as with ECFC-MOCK, thus demonstrating that engineered
ECFCs remained within tumor mass. The anti-uPAR
N-19 antibody stained only tumor cells of ECFC-MOCKtreated mice, while the staining was strongly reduced in
tumor mass of mice treated with ECFC-MMP12 (fig.
6B). These results demonstrated the MMP12-dependent
cleavage of full length uPAR, which is in agreement with
the inhibition of tumor growth by ECFC-MMP12 (Fig.
6A).
To evaluate the effect of MMP12-dependent uPAR
cleavage on tumor growth and on metastasis development
in tumor bearing mice, we injected ECFC-MMP12 or
ECFC-MOCK when tumor mass was evident in all the
mice injected with A375 cells and MSC. We observed
a significant decrease of tumor growth in mice which
received i.v. ECFC-MMP12, while in mice treated with

ECFC-MOCK the tumor continued to grow (Fig. 6C). At
the end of treatment tumor mass and lung were subjected
to histological analysis (Fig 6D). We demonstrated the
presence of injected ECFCs in tumor mass of all the mice
by using an anti-FLAG antibody. We also examined the
presence of full-lenght uPAR using the anti-uPAR N-19
antibody and angiogenesis by using anti-CD31 antibody.
Both antibodies stained only tumor cells of ECFC-MOCKtreated mice, while the staining was strongly decreased in
tumor mass of mice treated with ECFC-MMP12. These
results are indicative of a MMP12-dependent cleavage
of full length uPAR and the intratumoral angiogenesis
inhibition, which are in agreement with the inhibition of
tumor growth. We also examined the lungs to evaluate
the presence of metastasis. The ECFC-MMP12 treated
mice did not show any metastasis, while the control
mice exhibited a mean of 5-6 metastasis/lung, thus
demonstrating an anti-metastatic effect of injected ECFCMMP12.
In fig. 7 is shown a schematic representation of
our results: ECFC-MMP12 recruited in tumor mass, by
exploiting the CXCR4/SDF1 system, released the MMP12
anti-tumor uPAR degrading enzyme, thus impairing tumor
growth and angiogenesis.

Figure 7: Schematic representation of the concept of ECFCs as cellular vehicles delivering anti-tumor uPAR degrading
enzyme. ECFCs derived from cord blood, were transduced with lentiviral vectors encoding the matrix metalloproteinase 12 (MMP12).

Subcutaneous tumors were developed by direct co-injection of A375 and MSCs. Six days after tumor cells implantation, genetically
modified ECFCs labelled with 60 μCi of 111In 8-oxyquinoline (oxine) were injected intravenously into CD-1 nude (nu/nu). 24 hours later
the scintigraphic imagine showed that radiolabeled ECFCs were localized only in the tumor mass. High expression of SDF1 by tumour
cells and MSCs form a local gradient of the chemokine in the tumour region. CXCR4-expressing ECFCs are thus recruited to the tumour,
where they release active MMP12 enzyme which cleaves uPAR impairing angiogenesis and tumor growth.

DISCUSSION

nude mice could release such metalloproteinase into tumor
mass thereby controlling melanoma progression.
In this study we first confirmed that uPAR
levels correlated with tumor malignancy in different
melanoma cell lines and then we evaluated the role of
microenvironment on the invasive properties of melanoma
cells. We demonstrated that incubation of melanoma cells
with CM-ECFC or CM-MSC increased the invasion of
tumor cells, which depends on the up-regulation of full
length uPAR. This treatment also induced the downregulation of MMP12, which is in agreement with
full length uPAR-dependent tumor malignancy, thus
confirming a “protective role” of MMP12 in cancer
invasivity. To further verificate the role of MMP-12 in
inhibiting tumor invasion, we transiently transfected
A375 melanoma with MMP12 expression vector and
demonstrated that its consequent upregulation impaired
uPAR-dependent melanoma cell invasion.
It is known that EPCs recruitment into tumoral
tissues depends on the interaction of tumor chemokines
with related receptors expressed on EPCs. In particular,
CXCR4/SDF1 system plays a pivotal role in EPCs tumor
homing [45-48]. Herein, we demonstrated that ECFCs
express CXCR4 on their surface, while MSCs secrete large
amounts of SDF1. Moreover, melanoma cell incubation
with CM-ECFC or CM-MSC greatly up-regulated this
system. We have also shown that the in vitro invasivity of
ECFCs and in vivo ECFCs tumor homing depend on the
interaction between CXCR4 of ECFCs and SDF1 released
by MSCs and melanoma cells.
On the basis of these results, we used MSCs as
tumoral promoters by co-injecting them in mice together
with melanoma cells, with the aim of enriching tumor
microenvironment with SDF-1 molecular magnets able to
recruit ECFC-MMP12.
We engineered ECFCs with a lentivirus encoding
the uPAR-degrading enzyme MMP12 in order to induce
a lentivirus-dependent “gain of function” of MMP12
activity in ECFCs. This ex vivo manipulated ECFCs lost
the capacity to perform capillary morphogenesis in vitro
and, at the same time, acquired the anti-tumor and antiangiogenetic activity thus impairing invasion of melanoma
cells and the capillary morphogenesis of control ECs. In
vivo co-injection of melanoma cells with ECFC-MMP12
strongly inhibited tumor growth and, at the same time,
cleaved uPAR. These results are strongly suggestive of
an uPAR-dependent inhibition of tumor angiogenesis and
tumor spread. Finally, the i.v injection of ECFC-MMP12s
in melanoma bearing mice induced a significant decrease
of melanoma growth and inhibited the development
of lung metastasis. Immunohistochemical analysis of
tumor mass revealed that the delivered ECFCs remained
viable within implanted melanomas. Simultaneously,
we observed a lower amount of full length uPAR and
inhibition of angiogenesis. While confirming the data
obtained in vitro these results also indicate that the release

Tumor progression is characterized by increased
expression of uPA/uPAR system [7]. This system is finely
modulated: it is transiently expressed whenever cell
movement is required, as in inflammation, wound repair
and tumors, while its expression is low in normal quiescent
tissues. In the tumor microenvironment uPAR is expressed
not only in tumor cells but also in endothelial cells (EC),
fibroblasts, inflammatory cells (macrophages, neutrophils)
and in MSC thus becoming an attractive target for cancer
therapy [36, 37]. Our previous studies [8, 10]showed that
movement of endothelial and cancer cells depends on
the native full-lenght uPAR, and that truncation of uPAR
domain 1 by MMP12 results into the loss of their invasion
properties. In the last years a new idea about the role of
MMPs in cancer is emerging. Several MMPs, including
MMP12, display a protective effect by suppressing tumor
growth, thus accounting for the failure of clinical trials
which employed broad-range MMP inhibitors [17, 20].
Several strategies are emerging to target uPAR
[38, 40]. A new anti-cancer therapeutical strategy is the
“targeted therapy”, as opposed to traditional nonspecific
chemotherapy, thus reducing pharmacological side effects
and increasing the efficiency of the therapeutic approach.
Due to its activity, MMP12 can be considered a biological
drug to be used in targeted anti-uPAR therapy. To deliver
such molecules the so-called “cell-based therapies” are
becoming more relevant. Due to their capability to home
within tumors, MSC and EPCs are considered the best
candidates to be used as “Trojan Horses” carrying anticancer drugs [41-43].
EPCs play an important role in tumor vascularization
and metastatic transition either by their incorporation in
vessels or by supporting tumor angiogenesis via paracrine
secretion of proangiogenic cytokines. EPCs are selectively
recruited within the tumor mass [41]. The amount
of circulating EPCs positively correlates with tumor
progression and their levels decrease after chemotherapy
[26]. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are involved in
tumor growth by providing a stromal support and by
secreting angiogenic factors. Subcutaneous co-injection of
MSC and tumor cells exalts tumor progression [27, 28].
Moreover, over-expression of uPA-uPAR in tumors plays
an important role in recruitment of MSC in malignant
solid tumors [44].
Here we manipulated ECFCs, a sub-type of EPCs,
as cellular vehicle to deliver MMP12 into the tumor
mass with the aim to truncate uPAR both in endothelial
and tumor cells. We chose the solid tumor melanoma
because its distinctive features: it often affects patients <
60 years, its prognosis is mostly related to the thickness
of primary tumor in the skin and in its late phases (stage
IV) it is poorly responsive to conventional treatments.
We hypothesized that delivery of ECFCs engineered to
express MMP12 into human melanomas transplanted in

of MMP12 by engineered ECFCs recruited in the tumor
mass impairs tumor growth and metastasis mainly by
inhibiting uPAR-dependent angiogenesis and spread of
melanoma cells.
Many viral constructs have been designed to deliver
new therapeutic information into cancer cells, but none of
such viruses include an MMP12 construct. In this study
we suggest, for the first time, the employment of MMP12
as biological drug in the anti-tumoral cell-based therapy
in order to impair tumor angiogenesis and tumor invasion
of melanoma and of all those tumor which heavily depend
on uPAR to perform invasion.
Knowledge sprouting from these results indicate
the possibility to reduce tumour angiogenesis and
tumor progression in melanoma-bearing patients
through injection of autologous EPCs able to deliver the
MMP12 anticancer agent into tumor mass, which could
inhibit all the uPAR-dependent melanoma progression
characteristics. EPCs are a minor component of circulating
cells, but a series of methods are available for their
separation and ex-vivo expansion from human blood after
a proper stimulation of bone marrow [49, 50]. The use of
autologous ECFCs represent an effective melanoma tumor
treatment without rejection risk, that may cooperate with
standard therapy.
Results of this research have a translational
relevance and a potential impact for the health system
related to a better control of metastatic disease in
melanoma. An approach based on i.v. injection of MMP12engineered ECFCs, able to impair tumor progression
(therapy), and on the labelling of ECFC with 111In-oxine
for molecular imaging of primary and metastatic tumor
masses (diagnosis), provides a new and promising
MMP12 theranostic approach to human melanoma and to
future cancer medicine for all the tumor displaying uPARdependent cancer progression.

test the adipo- and osteo-differentiation capabilities. The
melanoma cell lines A375 and Mewo were obtained from
American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA) and
grown in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM)
with 10% FBS (Euroclone). M14 melanoma cells were
available in our laboratory.

Preparation of conditioned medium (CM-ECFC
and CM-MSC)
ECFC and MSC cells were seeded at density of 2.0
× 105 cells/ml in complete media into T-75 tissue culture
flasks and grown to approximately 80% confluency. Cells
were collected washed twice with phosphate-buffered
saline (PBS) and incubated overnight in 2% FCS medium.
Overnight condition media were collected and centrifuged
at 700 g at room temperature for 5 min to pellet cells. The
supernatant was collected and centrifuged at 2000 g at
4°C for 10 min to remove cell debris. The supernatant
representing ECFC-CM and MSC-CM was divided into
two aliquots one subjected for MMP12 detection and
the second aliquot was used for conditioning A375 cells.
In some experiments, conditioned medium (CM) was
prepared with MSCs pretreated with small-interferingRNA (siRNA) and negative control constructs obtained
from Riboxx Life Sciences/Euroclone (IBONI siRNApool, targeting human SDF1). siRNA constructs were
incorporated into RiboxxFECT transfection reagent
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Cells were
incubated for 48 hours with transfection mix.

quantitative PCR.

MATERIAL AND METHODS

Aliquots of culture media (20 µl) and lysates
(40μg) of A375 incubated for 24 hours with CM-ECFC
or CM-MSC, were subjected to Western blotting. The
primary antibodies were: anti-uPAR R3 (1:1000; mouse
monoclonal antibody, BioPorto Diagnostics), which
recognizes the full-length uPAR; anti-uPAR R4 (1:1000
mouse monoclonal antibody, BioPorto Diagnostics)
which reveals both the full-length and truncated form of
uPAR; anti-MMP12 (1:1000; rabbit polyclonal antibody,
Millipore) and anti-GAPDH (mAbcam 9484) as loading
control. After incubation with horseradish peroxidase–
conjugated donkey anti-mouse or anti-rabbit or antigoat IgG (1:10,000) for 1 hour, immune complexes were
detected with an enhanced chemiluminescence ECL
detection system (GE Healthcare). The membranes were
exposed to autoradiographic films for 1–10 minutes.
Total RNA was prepared using Nucleospin RNA II
(Macherey-Nagel), agarose gel checked for integrity, and

are reported in Table 1.

as described [10] in tissue culture wells coated with
Matrigel. ECFCs or HMVECs were plated (18x103/well)
in EBM-2 medium, supplemented with 2% FCS and
incubated at 37°C-5% CO2, under condition described
in Fig 5. Results were quantified at 6h by measuring the
percent field occupancy of capillary projections. Six to
nine photographic fields from three plates were scanned
for each point. Results were expressed as percent field
occupancy ± SD with respect to control fixed at 100%.

MMP12 transient transfection and uPAR cleavage
The cDNA-containing vector and the empty
plasmid (15 μg each of either pCDNA3.1 + MMP12 or
pCDNA3.1 alone; Invitrogen) were transiently transfected
into A375 cells using Lipofectamine Tranfection Reagents
(Invitrogen Co.)[10]. Briefly, 3.5×105 cells/well were
plated in six multiwell plates 24 hrs before transfection
and then complete medium was replaced. Expression of
MMP12 gene was measured by Real Time-PCR and the
level of released protein was analyzed by Western blotting
of culture medium.
To verify MMP12-dependent uPAR cleavage, 25
μg of recombinant human uPAR (R&D Systems) was
incubated overnight at 37°C with 15 μl of DMEM–2%
FBS or CM derived from empty vector or MMP-12
transiently transfected A375 or with CM derived from
ECFCs engineered to express MMP12. These experiments
were performed in the absence and in the presence of antiMMP12 antibody (10 μg/ml), as described [10].

Invasion assay and capillary morphogenesis.
Cells invasion was studied in Boyden chambers in
which the upper and lower wells were separated by 8 μm–
pore size polycarbonate filters coated with Matrigel (50
μg/filter; BD Biosciences). Cells (15×103) were placed in
the upper well, and invasion was performed for 6 hours
at 37°C-5% CO2 as previously described [8, 10]. A375
invasion was also evaluated either by adding CM-ECFC
or CM-MSC in lower well or after 24 hours preincubation
with DMEM–2% FCS, or with CMs-2% FCS. In some
experiments, invasion was performed in the presence of
2 μg/ml uPAR-neutralizing antibody R3 or anti-MMP12
polyclonal antibodies, or anti CXCR4 (R&D Systems)
or irrelevant IgG (Sigma). Some invasion experiments
were performed with the A375 transiently trasfected
with MMP12. In some chemoinvasion experiment
the filters coated with Matrigel were pre-incubated
overnight with CM ECFC MOCK and CM ECFC
MMP12. The day after the CM removed and untreated
A375 allowed to invade out of the matrix, across the
membrane.
In vitro capillary morphogenesis was performed

[31]. After electrophoresis, the gels were washed in 2.5%
Triton X-100 for 30 minutes and then incubated overnight
at 37°C in elastase assay buffer. Lysis of the substrate in
the gel was visualized by staining with Coomassie R-250

a calliper. Mice were sacrificed 25 days after tumor
cell implantation and tumor growth was estimated by
measuring the tumor volume determined by the formula:
(L x W 2 )/2, where L and W are the length and width.
For ECFCs tumor homing, ECFCs were resuspended
in medium containing 100 μCi of 111In 8-oxyquinoline
(oxine) (Perkin Elmer)/106 cells. After washing, 2-3x106
111
In 8-oxyquinoline (oxine) labeled cells were infused
intravenously into 12 tumor bearing nude mice. Six
tumor bearing mice were injected with labelled ECFCs
pre-incubated with anti-CXCR4 antibody (R&D Systems,
Minneapolis, MN; 10 μg/ml) and six mice were injected
with labelled ECFCs pre-incubated with irrelevant IgG
for 30 min. Animals were subjected to SPECT scan
using the microPET/SPECT/CT Trifoil Imaging [33].
Postlabeling viability exceeded 80%, and preliminary
experiments demonstrated adequate cell tracking. CT
scan was performed followed by the SPECT tomography,
starting at 30 min p.i. The CT/SPECT scan were acquired
as previously described [34]. The energy window was
set on the 111In photopeak ranging from 171 keV±10%
and at 245 keV±10%. Once the scanning session was
complete, animals were recovered in a housing unit and
monitored until awake. The fused images were visually
analyzed to detect the engrafted tumor mass or normal
tissue and regional SPECT activities were measured
using the analysis software Vivid (Gamma Medica-Ideas,
Northridge, CA) by delineating the region of interest
(ROI) of the tissue in the fused CT images. A similar ROI
was generated for the muscle tissue on the contralateral
side of the tumor. Tumor uptake efficiency (nTA) as
related to the ROI under evaluation, was obtained using
the following formula: nTA = TA-BA/BA, where TA is
tumor activity, BA is background activity measured in the
muscle tissue contralateral to the tumor and normalized to
injected activity. The same formula was used to evaluate
the uptake efficiency of different organs.
Evaluation of the therapeutic local effect of ECFCMMP12 on the tumor onset, were performed by coinjecting A375 cells and MSCs into 10 nude mice together
with 0.5x106 MOCK (5 mice) or ECFC-MMP12 (5 mice).
The animals were monitored daily and were sacrificed
after 18 days to evaluate tumor growth. The histological
analysis of tumor mass was performed as described below.
To evaluate the ECFC-MMP12 effect on in vivo
tumor progression, we injected melanoma cells with MSC
into nude mice and, after fifteen days, when the tumor mass
was evident, we performed i.v. injection of engineered 2
x 106 ECFCs, according to the following schedule: 8 mice
were treated with ECFC-MOCKs and 8 mice with ECFCMMP12s. The treatment was repeated after three and six
days and then tumor growth was followed by measuring
the tumor volume for five additional days, before the
tumour masses exceeded a size producing evident physical
discomfort. Removed tumors and lungs were fixed
overnight at 4°C in formalin (5% in PBS) for histological

To construct LvPGK-MMP12Flag, the MMP12-Flag
DNA sequence was amplified from the pCDNA3 plasmid
using primers containing BamHI and BsrGI restriction
sites (BamHI-5’cgggatcccgatggggaagtttcttc-3’ and BsrGI
5’ctgctactgctatttatcgcacatgtgc-3’) and subsequently cloned
in the lentiviral vector pRRLsin.PPT.hPGK.mcherry_pre
(kindly provided by dr Marco Erreni, Humanitas Clinical
and Research Center, Milan, Italy), replacing the mcherry
sequence. Similarly, the LvPGK-Flag control vector was
generated by synthesizing the Flag-tag sequence at 95°C
for 1 hour, using primers containing BamHI, ClaI and
BsrGI restriction sites (5’-cggga-tcccgtactacaaagacgatg
acgataaatagccatcgatggt-3’ and 5’-cgtgtacaccatcgatggcta
tttatcgtcatcgtctttgtag-tacgggatcccg-3’). All amplification
conditions were settled using the Phusion Hot Start II
high-fidelity DNA Polymerase (Finnzymes), according
to manufacturer’s instructions. Sequence integrity was
verified by standard sequence analysis (Primm srl,
Milan, Italy). The third-generation lentiviral vectors
were produced by transient transfection of 293T cells
according to standard protocols [32]. Briefly, subconfluent
293T-cells were co-transfected with 11,7 μg of the transfer
plasmid, 5 μg of packaging plasmid, 3.5 μg of envelope
plasmid and 5 μg of rev-expressing plasmid (ViraPowerTM
lentiviral packaging mix, Invitrogen) by Lipofectamine
(Invitrogen). After 16 h medium was changed, and 24
h later recombinant lentivirus vectors were collected,
filtered through 0.22-μm-pore-size cellulose acetate filters
and immediately used. To determine the maximum viral
efficiency, serial dilutions of freshly harvested conditioned
medium were used to infect 105 ECFC in a six-well plate
in the presence of Polybrene (8 μg/ml). After 24 hours
ECFC were incubated with complete medium, EBM-2
containing EGM-2 Single Quots (Lonza), and 48 h later
analyzed for infection efficiency, by Western blot.
