Abstract
B-lineage acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) arises by transformation of a progenitor (pre-B) cell. Cure
rates in adults remain low and treatment is complicated by support provided by the microenvironment to
the leukemic cells, indicating an urgent need to better understand the factors that promote their survival.
B-cell–activating factor (BAFF) and its receptor BAFF-R are important for survival and growth of mature
normal and malignant B cells but are not expressed on pre-B cells. Unexpectedly, all cells in the primary
Philadelphia chromosome (Ph)–positive and Ph-negative ALL samples tested were positive for high BAFF-R
cell surface expression. BAFF-R was fully competent to bind BAFF, and stimulation of the receptor activated
both the classic and the noncanonical NF-κB pathways. Recombinant BAFF supported survival of the ALL cells
in the absence of stroma, and it significantly attenuated the rate of apoptosis caused by exposure to nilotinib,
a drug used therapeutically to treat Ph-positive ALLs. Surprisingly, BAFF mRNA and protein were also
expressed in the same cells but BAFF was not shed into the medium. Our report is the first showing universal
expression of BAFF-R by pre-B ALL cells and opens the possibility of blocking its function as an adjuvant
therapeutic strategy. Cancer Res; 70(11); 4346–56. ©2010 AACR.

Introduction
Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is the most common
malignancy affecting children and is a major cause of mortality from hematopoietic malignancies in adults (1). The
t(9;22)(q34;q11) translocation, leading to the generation
of the Philadelphia chromosome (Ph), is the most common
cytogenetic abnormality in adult ALL and is associated with
a poor prognosis (2). The translocation moves ABL on chromosome 9 to BCR on chromosome 22 and results in the formation of a BCR-ABL fusion gene (3). The high incidence
of such unfavorable genetic alterations accounts for the
low overall cure rate in adult patients with ALL, and the

identification of new and more effective therapies remains
an urgent goal. To this end, a thorough understanding
of the survival signals and microenvironment contributing
to the establishment of the leukemic clone and its resistance
to therapy is required.
ALL develops by transformation of normal B-cell progenitors in the bone marrow. Pre-B ALL cells depend on bone
marrow stroma for in vitro proliferation and survival (4, 5).
Bone marrow stromal cells support leukemic cell growth
by the production of soluble factors such as CXCL12, interleukin-7, and Wnt proteins, as well as via cell-cell adhesion
mediated by molecules such as VLA-4/VCAM1 (6–8). Previously, we and others have shown that stroma exerts a protective effect that contributes to the poor response of leukemic
cells to chemotherapeutic drugs (9–11), and the examination
of the molecular nature of the protection provided by stroma
remains the focus of significant interest.
Several studies have shown that malignant B cells from
patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), non–
Hodgkin lymphoma B, and multiple myeloma express
abnormal levels of B-cell–activating factor (BAFF), which
protects these cells from spontaneous or drug-induced apoptosis (12–14). BAFF belongs to the tumor necrosis factor
(TNF) ligand family and either is displayed on the cell surface
or is released in a soluble form after cleavage from the
plasma membrane by a furin-like protease (15, 16). BAFF is
crucial for the survival, maturation, and differentiation of
normal B cells (17, 18).
The three known receptors for BAFF on B cells include
BCMA (B-cell maturation antigen), TACI (transmembrane
activator, calcium modulator, and cyclophilin ligand interactor), and BAFF-R/BR3 (BAFF receptor/BLyS receptor 3). Both

Functional BAFF-R in Pre-B ALL

BAFF and the related cytokine APRIL bind to TACI and
BCMA, whereas only BAFF binds to BAFF-R. The BAFF-R/
BR3 pathway in particular is crucial to the differentiation of
late primary B cells and survival of mature B cells (19, 20).
Interestingly, neoplastic B-lineage lymphocytes express not
only BAFF but also the receptors for BAFF, which, when ligated, can promote their cell survival in vitro (21).
BAFF-R expression was reported to be restricted to more
mature B cells, starting at the T1 transitional B-cell stage
(22). Thus, BAFF-R is not present on murine pro-B or
pre-B cells (20). In agreement with the proposed lack of significance of this receptor/cytokine for early B-cell development, mice lacking BAFF-R or BAFF have normal pro- and
pre-B-cell compartments (18, 19). Because Ph-positive ALL
cells typically represent transformed pre-B cells that do not
produce surface IgM, the BAFF-R/BAFF pathway would
not be anticipated to play a role in their survival or growth.
However, the expression of both BAFF and its receptor BAFFR in leukemias and lymphomas involving more mature
B-lineage cells prompted us to examine a possible role of
BAFF and its receptors in ALL. We here present evidence that
pre-B ALL is characterized by the abnormal expression of a
functional BAFF/BAFF-R pathway.

Materials and Methods
Human ALL cell culture
ALL cells used in this study are listed in Supplementary
Table S1. US7 and US7R were from one patient before and
after the patient developed drug resistance. US6 has a
t(7;14) translocation. TXL-2 and TXL-3 were from patients
at diagnosis. Primary viably frozen human ALL cells were
engrafted through tail vein injections into female NOD.
Cg-PrkdcscidIl2rgtm1Wjll/SzJ mice (The Jackson Laboratory).
Leukemia cells harvested from spleens were plated on irradiated OP9 feeder layers and grown in αMEM (Life Technologies), 20% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 1% L-glutamine,
and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. Murine OP9 (CRL-2749),
U937, and 293 were purchased from the American Type
Culture Collection. Viability of ALL cells collected from the
medium was determined by examining and manually counting total and trypan blue–excluding lymphoblasts, under
a microscope.
Expression studies
RNA was isolated using Trizol from ALL cells harvested
without stroma. First-strand synthesis used oligo(dT) as
primer. Primers for reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) of
BAFF-R, TACI, BCMA, BAFF, and β2-microglobulin have been
described (13). We used ELISA to detect soluble human BAFF
(Apotech Corp.) in ALL culture supernatant concentrated
using Amicon filters (Millipore).
We used a Becton Dickinson FACScan instrument for
fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis. Isotypematched antibody was used to verify staining specificity.
ALL cells were Fc blocked by treatment with 1 μg of human
IgG/105 cells for 15 minutes at room temperature before

staining. An Annexin apoptosis detection kit (BD Pharmingen) was used for detecting apoptotic cells.
For detection of NF-κB (p65 and p52), a nuclear extraction
kit (Imgenex) was used to separate nuclear and cytoplasmic
fractions. For Western blot BAFF, BAFF-R, and Pim-2 detection, 20 μg of cell lysates prepared in radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer containing 1 mmol/L phenylmethylsulfonyl
fluoride, 0.28 trypsin inhibitor units/mL aprotinin, 50 μg/mL
leupeptin, 1 mmol/L benzamidine, and 0.7 μg/mL pepstatin
were used.
Antibodies used in this study are described in detail in
Supplementary Table S2.
Isolation of mononuclear cells from ALL and normal
control bone marrow
Viably frozen bone marrow from a normal donor and a
patient with ALL was obtained from the National Disease
Research Interchange (Philadelphia, PA). Samples were
thawed, RBC lysis was performed, and the cells were pelleted.
Cells were suspended in PBS−/−, and mononuclear cells were
isolated by centrifugation on a Ficoll gradient (according to
Miltenyi Biotec). Peripheral blood mononuclear cells from
US.7R had been viably frozen directly from the patient. Mononuclear cells were incubated with CD19, IgM, CD10, and
BAFF-R antibodies. Cells were gated for the CD19+, IgM−,
CD10+ fraction and then examined for BAFF-R expression.
Statistical analysis
Results are shown as mean ± SD of at least three samples
each. For statistical comparison between groups, the Student's
t test was used, with a P value <0.05 considered significant.

Results
Human ALL cells express the BAFF receptor BR3
Primary cells from different B-lineage ALL patients were
passaged in NOD.Cg-Prkdc scid Il2rg tm1Wjll /SzJ mice using
previously published protocols (23). To culture these
cells ex vivo, we used OP9 stromal cells because we found
that murine embryonic fibroblasts (MEF), which we previously used to support the ex vivo growth of murine ALL cells,
failed to support the long-term growth of these human ALL
cells.
In initial experiments, we examined the human ALL cells
for mRNA expression using semiquantitative RT-PCR
for BAFF-R, TACI, and BCMA. Ramos and Jurkat cells were
used as positive and negative controls. To our surprise, as
shown in Fig. 1A, all of the four human ALL cells tested were
positive for BAFF-R and TACI. However, they showed very
weak or no expression of BCMA. To examine whether the detected mRNA resulted in production of substantial amounts
of cell surface receptors, flow cytometric analysis was done
on 12 different ALL samples. Surprisingly, all showed high
expression of BAFF-R (Fig. 1B; Supplementary Table S1). Remarkably, within the individual samples, >90% of the cells
were positive. Of the different ALL samples tested for the expression of TACI and BCMA, all were weakly positive for
TACI (Fig. 1B; Supplementary Table S1) but negative for

BCMA (Fig. 1B; Supplementary Table S1). Although 25% to
40% of the cells expressed TACI, the intensity of expression
was much lower compared with the BAFF-R expression on
these cells (Fig. 1B). Both Ph-positive and Ph-negative ALL
samples expressed BAFF-R (Supplementary Table S1).
Pre-B ALL cells isolated from fresh bone marrow and
peripheral blood of ALL patients express BAFF-R
The samples that tested positive for BAFF-R had all
been passaged in mice and then plated on stroma. We
therefore considered the possibility that passage in mice
had induced BAFF-R expression in the ALL cells. To address this question, we obtained uncultured fresh bone
marrow and peripheral blood and isolated mononuclear
cells from these ALL samples. We also obtained bone marrow from a healthy donor. We gated for CD19+CD10+IgM−

cells to identify pre-B cells and tested these for the expression of BAFF-R, TACI, and BCMA using flow cytometry.
Consistent with earlier reports, normal pre-B cells were
negative for expression of BAFF-R, BCMA, and TACI
(Fig. 2A). About 60% of the population of mononuclear
cells in the ALL patient's bone marrow consisted of
CD10+, CD19+, IgM− cells (data not shown). More than
50% of gated pre-B ALL cells from the bone marrow of
this patient (Fig. 2B) and from the peripheral blood of a
different patient (Fig. 2C) were positive for BAFF-R and
uniformly negative for BCMA and TACI expression
(Fig. 2B and C).
To confirm the expression of BAFF-R by noncultured
human ALL cells, we used Western blot analysis on lysates
made from independent peripheral blood lymphocytes of
two Ph-positive and three Ph-negative ALLs. As shown in

Figure 1. Human ALL cells cultured in vitro express BAFF receptors. A, semiquantitative RT-PCR on RNA from human ALL cells cultured on OP9

BAFF receptor expressed by ALL cells shows high
affinity toward its ligand BAFF
Early B cells can differentiate into more mature stages
when cocultured with feeder stromal layers (24, 25). Acute
myeloid leukemia cells (26) and CLL cells (27) were reported
to differentiate in vitro, and hence, we considered the possibility that the presence of stromal feeder layers had changed the
immunophenotype of the cells. However, all the human ALL

www.aacrjournals.org

cells tested retained their phenotype (CD19+CD10+IgM−) after
in vitro culture (TXL-2; Fig. 3A; similar data for the other samples; data not shown). We also examined the expression of
BAFF-R on different ALL cells growing in the absence of stroma for 5 days using flow cytometry. As shown in Fig. 3B, cells
remained positive for BAFF-R also in the absence of stroma.
We next asked whether the BAFF-R expressed by these
cells is functional. We used a specific monoclonal antibody (clone 11c1) in this experiment to detect cell surface BAFF-R on the ALL cells after incubating overnight
with 100 ng/mL recombinant BAFF. Due to spatial competition, the 11c1 anti–BAFF-R antibody is unable to bind

to B cells in the presence of high amounts of added recombinant BAFF (28). As shown in Fig. 3C, >90% of the
ALL cells that had previously been incubated with recombinant BAFF were negative for detection of BAFF-R with

this antibody; thus, the BAFF-R expressed by ALL cells
was occupied with BAFF. This indicates that the BAFF-R
expressed by ALL cells shows a high affinity toward its
ligand BAFF.
Expression of BAFF and its signaling in human ALL cells
We considered the possibility that the pre-B ALL cells
could also express the ligand for BAFF-R, BAFF. We first
evaluated the cells for BAFF mRNA by RT-PCR. As shown
in Fig. 4A, all four of the ALL cells tested were positive
for BAFF mRNA expression. BAFF is a member of the broader
family of TNF-like cytokines, existing as a membrane-bound
and as a secreted form. As shown in Fig. 4B, flow cytometry
analysis showed that the membrane-associated form of BAFF
was present on the surface of BLQ-1, US.7, and TXL-2. The
ALL cells were also evaluated for the presence of secreted
human BAFF by ELISA using conditioned medium collected
from ALL cell culture. However, we did not detect expression
of this form of human BAFF (data not shown). We also examined the expression of BAFF protein by Western blot. As
shown in Fig. 4C, BAFF was clearly present in the ALL cells.
BCMA and TACI signaling activates NF-κB through
the canonical pathway, whereas signaling through BAFF-R
was reported to activate both the canonical and the alternative pathways (29–31). We therefore examined intracellular signaling pathways induced by BAFF in the ALL cells.
In B cells, the BAFF-mediated activation of the alternative
NF-κB pathway involves processing of p100 to p52, with
subsequent translocation of p52 to the nucleus (31, 32).
When ALL cells incubated with BAFF for 20 hours were
separated into a cytoplasmic and a nuclear fraction, there
was a substantial (>8-fold) increase of processed p52 in
the nuclear fraction and a concomitant decrease of p100 in
the cytoplasm compared with non–BAFF-treated controls
(Fig. 4D, left).
Although most studies suggest that BAFF activates the
classic NF-κB pathway through TACI and BCMA (29), Enzler
and colleagues (33) reported that BAFF-R also contributes to
activation of the classic pathway. We therefore also examined nuclear levels of p65, which migrates to the nucleus
on activation of the classic NF-κB pathway. Compared with
control ALL cells without BAFF treatment, nuclear levels of
p65 were increased ∼2-fold after 30 minutes in the presence
of BAFF (Fig. 4D, right).

indicated for 16 h with or without recombinant human BAFF (100 ng/mL)
were examined for cell surface BAFF-R expression.

Effect of BAFF on growth of ALL cells
Primary ALL cells do not initially grow in culture without
stromal support and are prone to apoptosis in vitro due to
lack of proper survival signals. As mentioned above, we found
that MEFs did not support ALL growth in long-term culture.
However, OP9 bone marrow stromal cells were able to provide the required support to sustain the in vitro growth of
ALL cells in long-term culture (Fig. 5A). Interestingly, we
found that OP9 produced significantly higher amounts of
BAFF than MEFs (Fig. 5B). This suggested that the human
ALL cells require BAFF for long-term growth. To test this,
we cultured ALL cells in the absence of stroma and using
5% FBS, with or without recombinant BAFF. Viability of the

BCMA-Fc compared with human Ig–Fc.

ALL cells dropped under these stringent conditions, but
the presence of BAFF significantly delayed the decrease in
viability starting at day 7 of incubation (Fig. 5C, left). There
are no small-molecule inhibitors available to block BAFF-R
signaling. However, antibodies have been used to attempt
to block BAFF-R function. We therefore incubated the ALL
cells with a neutralizing BAFF-R antibody (5 μg/mL) for 9
days. Although there was only a partial inhibition of BAFFinduced NF-κB signaling in ALL cells by this antibody (data
not shown), there was a measurable reduction in cell viability
after 5 days of exposure to the neutralizing antibody as shown
in Fig. 5C (right).
An autocrine loop could be present on the ALL cells
because they express both BAFF and BAFF-R. To investigate this possibility, we incubated a Ph-negative and a Phpositive ALL with a human BAFF decoy receptor-Fc fusion

4352

protein, BCMA-Fc, which can neutralize the effect of human
BAFF (19). Interestingly, as shown in Fig. 5D, at day 5 in the
absence of stroma, there was a significant reduction in
cell viability in the presence of BCMA-Fc in comparison
with control human IgG-Fc–treated wells. Addition of human
recombinant BAFF reduced this inhibitory effect, indicating
a role of autocrine BAFF signaling in the survival of the
ALL cells.
Recombinant BAFF reduces drug-induced ALL cell
apoptosis
It has been reported that autocrine and paracrine BAFF signaling promotes the accumulation of non–Hodgkin lymphoma
B cells by attenuating apoptosis (14). BAFF also protected primary myeloma cells cultured with the patient's own bone marrow stroma from dexamethasone-induced apoptosis (13).

Functional BAFF-R in Pre-B ALL

Therefore, we investigated whether BAFF could protect ALL
cells from apoptosis induced by a chemotherapeutic drug. Nilotinib is a selective and potent Bcr/Abl tyrosine kinase inhibitor that is currently used to treat Ph-positive leukemias (34). To
exclude the possibility that nilotinib might affect the ability of
OP9 stroma to support ALL cell growth, we cultured a Ph-negative ALL (US.7) in the presence of nilotinib. Because nilotinib

is a Bcr/Abl tyrosine kinase inhibitor, it has no effect on Phnegative cells (34). As shown in Fig. 6A (right), neither viability
nor proliferation of US.7 cells growing over OP9 stroma was
affected by the presence of nilotinib, which indicates that
the capacity of OP9 stroma to support ALL growth is not affected by nilotinib. We then cultured Ph-positive TXL-2 ALL
cells in the presence of nilotinib with or without recombinant

BAFF for 10 days. At day 7, as expected, the total viable cell
number in wells treated with nilotinib had decreased
(Fig. 6A, left). However, there were significantly more viable
cells in the nilotinib + BAFF–treated wells, as is exemplified
in Fig. 6B. To examine the rate of cell death and apoptosis
induced by the drug, cells were collected at day 6 and stained
with propidium iodide (PI) and Annexin V. A significant reduction in the number of PI-positive and Annexin V–positive cells
was noticed in the presence of BAFF compared with the drug
alone–treated wells (Fig. 6C), indicating that BAFF reduced
the rate of apoptosis caused by the nilotinib treatment.
Although the effect of BAFF on in vitro B-cell survival is
mediated through the classic and alternative NF-κB pathways, each pathway makes a distinct contribution to the
expression of antiapoptotic genes. Activation of either
the classic or alternative pathway enhances expression of
the antiapoptotic proteins A1/Bfl1 and Bcl-XL, whereas induction of the prosurvival Pim-2 kinase exclusively depends
on the alternative pathway (33). Hence, we analyzed Pim-2
expression in the ALL cells treated with nilotinib or nilotinib
and BAFF. As shown in Fig. 6D, compared with nilotinib
only–treated cells, the addition of BAFF clearly induced the
expression of Pim-2, suggesting that the decreased apoptosis
of nilotinib-treated ALL cells in the presence of BAFF might
be mediated at least in part by upregulation of Pim-2.

Discussion
The cytokine BAFF is produced by a number of cell types, including monocytes, neutrophils, macrophages, dendritic cells,
and some subsets of T cells (17). Receptors for BAFF, however,
were initially thought to be restricted to more differentiated
B-lineage cells. Therefore, the expression of BAFF receptors
on transformed B-lineage lymphocytes in CLL was not entirely
unexpected. In contrast, based on BAFF-null and BAFF-R–null
mutants as well as other studies, it has been generally accepted
that precursor B-lineage cells do not express this receptor.
Our studies confirm that there is no expression of this receptor
in normal bone marrow pre-B cells. Interestingly, Rodig and
colleagues (35) also performed FACS on two pre-B ALL samples
and reported that these were negative for expression of BAFF-R.
Therefore, the prominent expression of the BAFF-R that we
detected on both Ph-positive and Ph-negative ALL samples
was unanticipated. In fact, all 12 samples that were tested by
us, including original ALL bone marrow and blood samples,
were BAFF-R positive, and BAFF-R was detected using both
Western blots and FACS analysis. We conclude that this receptor is an excellent tumor-specific marker that distinguishes
malignant pre-B cells from their normal counterparts.
We considered the possibility that BAFF-R expression
would be downregulated when the ALL cells lost contact
with stromal support, but BAFF-R expression was remarkably stable over time and remained even when stromal contact was removed for 5 days. The presence of BAFF-R on 50%
to 99% of all the cells in the individual samples suggests that
it has been selected for and has some important function.
Because BAFF-R promotes survival of normal B cells, it could
also provide a survival signal to the ALL cells. Indeed, a role

4354

Cancer Res; 70(11) June 1, 2010

for BAFF-R in the survival of neoplastic B cells, such as CLL,
lymphoma, and myeloma, has been reported (13, 36–38). We
provide evidence that the presence of BAFF-R on the pre-B
ALL cells similarly increases their survival, although viability
of ALL cells cultured with recombinant human BAFF alone
was not as high as that of cells cultured with OP9 stroma. This
was not unexpected because physical (cell-cell) contact is
known to constitute one component of the stromal support
to ALL and other leukemia cells (39). In addition, recombinant
exogenously added BAFF may not be qualitatively equivalent
to that processed by cells, such as that produced in significant
amounts by the OP9 cells.
In B cells, BAFF activates the classic and alternative NF-κB
pathways. Signals through BAFF-R mainly activate the alternative pathway, whereas the classic NF-κB pathway is stimulated through BAFF-R, TACI, and BCMA. Both mechanisms
of NF-κB activation play important roles in B-cell development and survival (33, 40–42). Interestingly, constitutive
NF-κB activation is a molecular signature that has been
reported in several malignant B-cell types, including ALL
cells (43, 44). We observed BAFF-induced degradation of
p100 to p52 and translocation of p65 to the nucleus in ALL
cells, suggesting that BAFF induces activation of both classic
and alternative NF-κB pathways also in ALL cells.
In vivo and in vitro studies have shown that BAFF signaling
increases the expression of antiapoptotic molecules and promotes cell survival, cell cycle progression, and proliferation of
B cells. Pim-2 is one of the antiapoptotic genes induced by
BAFF signaling in B cells (33, 45). We also measured BAFF-induced Pim-2 expression in ALL cells that were exposed to a
therapeutic drug, whereas the levels of Bcl-2 remained unchanged (data not shown). Because BAFF-induced long-term
survival of B cells with upregulation of Pim-2 depends only on
the alternative pathway (33), BAFF may provide protection
against drug-induced apoptosis through activation of the alternative NF-κB pathway.
The simultaneous expression of BAFF-R as well as that of
BAFF has been reported both in normal murine microglial
cells and on malignant human lymphoma cells (14, 36, 46).
Remarkably, we observed that the pre-B ALL cells also
expressed BAFF mRNA and protein, which points to the possibility of an autocrine BAFF signaling loop in these cells.
However, although the pre-B ALL cells expressed amounts
of BAFF detectable by Western blots in total cell lysates,
we did not detect soluble human BAFF in ALL cultureconditioned medium, with a detection level of <1 ng/mL. Interestingly, when we blocked human BAFF using a BCMA-Fc
decoy receptor, the survival of the ALL cells was reduced,
suggesting that the cell surface BAFF on the ALL cells provides an autocrine or paracrine BAFF survival signal.
Our data show that BAFF-R is a pre-B leukemia-specific cell
surface antigen that could be used for diagnostic purposes.
Moreover, inhibitors that block the BAFF/BAFF-R interaction
could be valuable specific therapeutic agents in pre-ALL. This
receptor-ligand combination is thought to play a role in autoimmune disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis (47), and different approaches to inhibit the interaction have been
reported (48). Unfortunately, to date, a potent inhibitor has
