BACKGROUND: Bevacizumab in combination with carboplatin and paclitaxel improves overall response
and survival in patients with advanced or recurrent nonsmall cell lung carcinoma. However, this drug is not
recommended in patients with squamous cell carcinoma or neoplasms with a dominant squamous component. Therefore, identification of squamous cell differentiation has therapeutic implications. In many instances, cytology is the diagnostic tool of choice; however, routine cytomorphology is limited in classification
of nonsmall cell carcinomas into squamous and nonsquamous subtypes. The aim of this study was to identify the value of p63 immunocytochemical analysis in this distinction. METHODS: Review of cytology
records identified 51 consecutive pulmonary specimens (16 fine needle aspiration samples, 15 washes, 12
brushes, and 8 lavages) with the diagnosis of nonsmall cell lung carcinoma (9 carcinomas with squamous
differentiation and 42 carcinomas without squamous differentiation). Histologically, they all proved to be
nonsmall cell carcinomas, 26 with squamous differentiation and 25 without squamous differentiation. p63
immunocytochemical stain was performed on archival alcohol-fixed Papanicolaou-stained cytology slides
using standard immunocytochemical methods. RESULTS: Twenty-three (88 %) of the 26 histologically proven squamous cell carcinomas were positive for p63 on cytologic smears. By using p63 immunocytochemistry, the authors detected 14 carcinomas with squamous differentiation not identified by cytomorphology.
Smears from all histologically proven carcinomas with squamous differentiation were positive for p63. Sensitivity of cytology for the detection of nonsmall cell carcinoma of lung with squamous differentiation
increased from 35% to 88% using p63 immunocytochemistry (P ¼ .001; McNemar test). The squamous component in 4 carcinomas was detected only in cytologic and not in corresponding histologic samples when
subsequent p63 immunostaining was performed. CONCLUSIONS: The authors concluded that p63 is a useful marker for the detection of nonsmall cell carcinomas of lung with squamous differentiation when used
in cytologic pulmonary samples. p63 immunocytochemistry significantly increases the sensitivity for the
identification of lung neoplasms with squamous differentiation from 35% to 88% (P ¼ .001). Therefore, p63

KEY WORDS: bevacizumab, nonsmall cell carcinoma, p63, squamous differentiation.

In the United States, lung cancer is the leading cause of

cancer-related death in both men and women.1 Approximately 85% are nonsmall cell carcinoma (NSCC). Traditionally, the distinction between small cell carcinoma and
NSCC had a considerable therapeutic implication2; however, the subclassification of NSCC into glandular and
squamous subtypes had no therapeutic impact. Recently,
target therapy has been successfully used in subtypes of
NSCC. Bevacizumab, a humanized variant of monoclonal
immunoglobulin G1 antibody, inhibits the biologic activity of human vascular endothelial growth factor.3 This
drug has been used for treatment of NCCA of lung.4-6 In
combination with chemotherapeutic agents such as carboplatin and paclitaxel, it has been approved as first-line
therapy for patients with unresectable, locally advanced,
recurrent or metastatic NSCC.4 In addition, erlotinib in
combination with bevacizumab is currently in study for
the treatment of pulmonary NSCC.7 Patients with pure
or partial squamous histology have an increased risk for
life-threatening pulmonary hemorrhage, some of which
may be fatal.4,8 Therefore, only patients with nonsquamous cell carcinoma or mixed subtypes of NSCC, if the
predominant cell type is nonsquamous, are eligible for
bevacizumab.4
The detection of a squamous cell component in
pathology samples is desirable for treatment selection.
In many instances, cytology is the only diagnostic tool.
Routine cytomorphology, however, is limited to subtyping NSCC into carcinomas with squamous differentiation (SqD) and without (NoSqD). p63, a member of
the p53 family, is normally expressed in squamous and
urothelial cells, basal layers of prostatic glands, breast,
and bronchial epithelia. Likewise, carcinomas of squamous and urothelial origin express this nuclear antigen.9
The aim of this study was to identify the value of p63
immunocytochemistry in distinction between SqD and
NoSqD in NSCC of lung when cytologic samples are
the only available diagnostic material in patients with
suspected lung cancer.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Slides from 51 consecutive patients with the diagnosis of
NSCC (9 SqD and 42 NoSqD) of lung based on cytologic
material (2003-2006) who had histological follow-up
were retrieved from the cytology files for this study (Table
1). The patient’s mean age was 63 years. There were 38
men and 13 women (ratio, 3:1). Sixteen samples were fine
needle aspirations, 15 were bronchial washings, 12 were
bronchial brushings, and 8 were bronchioloalveolar lavages. The corresponding histologic slides were reviewed
for comparison (26 NSCC with SqD and 25 NSCC with
NoSqD) (Table 1). P63 immunocytochemical stain was
performed on archival alcohol-fixed Papanicolaou (Pap)stained cytology slides without destaining.10 Initially, malignant cells were marked with diamond pen on the back
of the cytology slides for proper identification of the neoplastic cells. The slides then were stained with standard
immunocytochemical methods.10 Briefly, the slide’s glass
cover was removed; however, the selected cells that were
marked with diamond pen remained on the slides for easy
detection after the p63 staining. The slides then were
treated with 6% hydrogen peroxide for 3 minutes to block
endogenous peroxidase activity, followed by washing in
tap water for 2 minutes. Pressure cooker was used for antigen retrieval along with target retrieval solution (Dako,
S1699, Glostrup, Denmark). Avidin Biotin Blocking System (Szeged, Hungary) was used. Slides were incubated
with monoclonal p63 antibody (Dako, M7247), used at a
dilution of 1:50. Fast Green (1% cupric sulfate, for 1
minute) was used for counterstaining. Positive and
negative controls were used.

RESULTS
Only cells present in diamond-marked areas were evaluated for p63 staining. A strong and well-defined nuclear
staining was considered a positive reaction. Positive benign bronchial reserve cells serve as positive internal control in p63-negative carcinoma cases (Fig. 1). Twenty47

three (88%) of 26 histologically proven NSCC with SqD
were positive for p63 on cytologic smears (Table 2) (Fig.
2). All 9 cases with cytologic evidence of NSCC with SqD
were positive for p63. In 14 NSCCs, the neoplastic squamous component was only identified using p63 immunostaining. Four NSCC with SqD were detected only in
cytologic and not in corresponding histologic samples after p63 immunostaining (Table 2). Sensitivity of cytologic
methods for the detection of NCCC of lung with SqD
increased from 35% to 88% using p63 immunocytochemistry (P ¼ .001; McNemar test) (Table 3).

DISCUSSION
Cytologic distinction of NSCC of lung with SqD from
other neoplasms with NoSqD may not always be straightforward based solely on cytomorphologic findings,

especially in poorly differentiated neoplasms. Until
recently, this differentiation had an academic and not a
therapeutic implication, because all variants of NSCC
were treated with similar chemotherapy regimens with or
without combined radiation therapy. Bevacizumab, a
monoclonal antibody against vascular endothelial growth
factor, has been shown to benefit patients with a variety of
cancers.11 This drug, when combined with carboplatin
and paclitaxel in the treatment of selected patients with
NSCC of lung, has significant survival benefit, but has
been associated with increased treatment-related deaths.4
These complications may occur in particular in patients
with lung carcinomas with histologic evidence of squamous differentiation.4,8 When used in patients with
NSCC with NoSqD and good performance status, bevacizumab prolongs overall survival and progression-free
survival and improves response rate.4,8 Therefore, the
detection of squamous differentiation in cytologic samples is desirable.
Previous studies have been performed to evaluate
the usefulness of p63 in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded samples for the distinction of NSCC versus small cell
carcinoma of lung because of its implications in patient
management.12-14 In these studies, 97% to 100% of
NSCC with SqD stained positively with anti-p63, and
small cell carcinomas were negative for this antibody.
Cytologic samples including cell blocks,15 Pap-stained
smears,16 and destained preparations17 have also been
used to differentiate NSCC and small cell carcinoma of
lung using p63 immunocytochemical staining. Fewer
studies, however, have evaluated the usefulness of p63 in
subtyping lung NSCCs into SqD and NoSqD neoplasms
in paraffin-embedded tissue.13,14 We investigated the
usefulness of p63 in the identification of NSCC with SqD
using cytologic material, because in many instances cytology is the only available material for diagnosis. By using
p63 immunocytochemical analysis, the detection of

squamous differentiation in lung cytologic samples
increased significantly from 35% to 88% (P ¼ .001) in
our study. Routine cytology or using p63 immunostaining did not detect 3 lung adenocarcinomas with squamous
differentiation diagnosed by histology. These cases may
represent sampling error, because the squamous component was probably not present in the cytologic specimen.
Likewise, and also probably for sampling reasons, 4 carcinomas detected as NSSC with SqD by cytology using p63
immunocytochemical analysis could not be proven as
neoplasms with squamous histology in biopsy samples.
Excisional specimens were not available for the discrepant
group, because neoadjuvant chemotherapy modalities
were the treatment of choice, and lobectomies/pneumonectomies were not universally performed. The finding
that the surgical excision is not typically available for cases
of advanced NSCC underscores the potential significance
of improved diagnostic sampling provided by cytologic
specimens.
For practical interpretative reasons, we need to
emphasized that normal bronchial reserve cells may be
present in cytologic samples. They are naturally p63 positive,9 and therefore interpretation of p63 results should be
restricted to the cells in groups previously identified as
morphologically malignant and marked with diamond
pen. Immunocytochemical analysis for p63 may be used
in pulmonary cytologic samples with the diagnosis of
NSCC to detect squamous differentiation and improve
the therapeutic selection of patients. Finally, alcohol-fixed
Pap-stained slides may be used for immunocytochemistry
without postformalin fixation and destaining process.
