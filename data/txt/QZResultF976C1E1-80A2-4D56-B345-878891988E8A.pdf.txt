ABSTRACT
Statins (3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A [HMG-CoA] reductase
inhibitors) are well-established agents to treat hyperlipidemic states. Experimental
and epidemiological evidence further implies an anticancer effect of these
substances. This study investigates the mechanism underlying human lung cancer
cell death by lovastatin and the role of the prostaglandin (PG)-synthesizing enzyme
cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) in this process. In A549 and H358 lung carcinoma cells
the lipophilic prodrug lovastatin lactone led to a concentration-dependent decrease of
viability and induction of DNA fragmentation, whereas its HMG-CoA-inhibitory, ringopen acid form was inactive in this respect. Apoptotic cell death by lovastatin was
accompanied by high intracellular levels of the lactone form, by upregulation of COX2 mRNA and protein, as well as by increased formation of peroxisome proliferatoractivated receptor γ (PPARγ)-activating PGD2 and 15-deoxy-Δ12,14-PGJ2. Cells were
significantly less sensitive to lovastatin-induced apoptotic cell death, when the
expression or activity of COX-2 was suppressed by siRNA or by the COX-2 inhibitor
NS-398. Apoptosis by lovastatin was likewise reversed by the PPARγ antagonist
GW9662. Fluorescence microscopy analyses revealed a lovastatin-induced cytosolto-nucleus translocation of PPARγ that was inhibited by NS-398. Collectively, this
study demonstrates COX-2 induction and subsequent COX-2-dependent activation of
PPARγ as a hitherto unknown mechanism by which lovastatin lactone induces human
lung cancer cell death.

INTRODUCTION

Besides their use as cholesterol-lowering agents,
statins are currently considered and evaluated as potential
drugs for cancer therapy [2]. Accordingly, several
epidemiological studies have proven an association
between statin use and diminished cancer incidence
[3-5] as well as mortality [6]. In case of lung cancer, a
retrospective case-control study has found an association
of statin use for > 6 months with a 55% risk reduction
[7]. In addition, in vitro experiments with cancer cells
revealed statins to exhibit pronounced antiproliferative [8,
9], proapoptotic [10, 11], anti-invasive [12-14] and antiangiogenic effects [15-17].
However, conflicting data have been published
concerning the contribution of lactone and acid forms
to the anticancerogenic statin action. On the one hand,

Belonging to the most commonly prescribed drugs
worldwide, statins are therapeutically used to treat primary
and secondary hypercholesterolemia. Statins inhibit
3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA)
reductase, an early and rate-limiting enzyme of cholesterol
synthesis, thereby preventing the conversion of HMGCoA to mevalonate, and reducing the levels of mevalonate
and its downstream products. Statins are administered in
its active ring-open hydroxy-acid form (e.g., pravastatin,
atorvastatin) or as inactive lactone prodrugs (lovastatin,
simvastatin) with the latter group of drugs becoming
metabolized to a ring-open hydroxy-acid form that inhibits
HMG-CoA reductase activity (for review see [1]).

several studies have associated such effects with decreased
formation of the mevalonate downstream products
farnesyl pyrophosphate and geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate
by ring-open acid forms of statins. In fact, both products
are essential regulators of membrane localisation and
function of small G proteins [18] that confer mitogenic
[19], adhesive and invasive properties [20] of cancer
cells. On the other hand, the dogma of the ring-open form
being the sole active configuration of statins has been
challenged. Accordingly, lovastatin lactone was shown
to elicit growth inhibitory effects on human breast cancer
cells by inhibition of the proteasome, whereas pravastatin,
a ring-open and therefore direct HMG-CoA reductaseinhibitory statin with a structure and potency similar to
lovastatin acid, was inactive in both respects [21]. This
and sequential studies [22, 23] have raised the question
whether physicochemical properties (i.e., lipophilicity
that determines the ability to pass cellular membranes)
might explain the differential impact of statins on cancer
growth. However, despite the fact that lovastatin lactone
elicits proteasome inhibition [21-23], the exact mechanism
underlying its cytotoxic and proapoptotic action on cancer
cells is far from being understood.
In past years upregulation of the prostaglandin (PG)synthesizing enzyme cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) has
emerged as a proapoptotic mechanism shared by various
antitumorigenic compounds including chemotherapeutics
[24-27], cannabinoids [28-31], endocannabinoid-like
substances [32] as well as the analgesic celecoxib [33].
In this context, several studies indicated COX-2-derived
PGD2 and 15-deoxy-Δ12,14-PGJ2 (15d-PGJ2) to evoke COX2-dependent apoptosis by activating the transcription
factor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ
(PPARγ) [26, 29, 31, 33-36]. Notably, statins likewise
induce the expression of COX-2 [37-39] or activate
PPARγ [40] in a variety of cell types. However, a causal
link of these targets to statin-induced cancer cell apoptosis
has not been established so far.
The present study therefore investigates a potential
contribution and coordinated action of COX-2 and PPARγ
within the lovastatin lactone-induced apoptosis of human
lung cancer cells. Here we present evidence for a hitherto
unknown statin-induced proapoptotic pathway involving
initial upregulation of COX-2 and a subsequent activation
of PPARγ by de novo synthesized COX-2-dependent PGs.

exhibit concentration-dependent cytotoxic properties.
IC50 values of lovastatin lactone´s effect on viability
were 76.7 µM (A549) and 45.2 µM (H358), respectively.
Lovastatine lactone at 50 µM (A549) and 75 µM (H358)
elicited characteristic apoptotic features such as membrane
blebbing that were not observed in A549 and H358 cells
treated with equimolar concentrations of lovastatin
acid (Figure 1C, left side). In agreement with these
observations, additional apoptotic parameters such as
caspase-3 were triggered by lavostatin lactone, whereas
the acid form only faintly induced caspase-3 activation
in both cell lines (Figure 1C, right side, upper 2 blots).
To confirm the caspase-3-dependent apoptotic pathway,
we next analyzed cleavage of the DNA repair protein
and caspase-3 substrate, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase
(PARP). In line with the cleavage pattern of caspase-3,
the lactone form induced PARP cleavage to a much larger
extent than the acid form (Figure 1C, right side, blots in
line 3 and 4).
Quantification of DNA fragmentation as a further
apoptotic characteristic revealed a concentrationdependent DNA fragmentation by lovastatin lactone that
was not detectable in cells treated with lovastatin acid
(Figure 1D).

Extra- and intracellular concentrations of
lovastatin lactone and acid following incubation
of cells with either form
To determine the extent of extracellular and
intracellular hydrolysis of lovastatin lactone as well as
its uptake as unhydrolyzed lipophilic form, time-course
experiments with lovastatin lactone-treated A549 and
H358 cells were performed. Using the same experimental
setting, comparative experiments were carried out with
cells incubated with an equimolar concentration of
lovastatin acid.
As shown in Figure 2A, 2C, left, extracellular
lovastatin lactone measured in cell culture supernatants
became hydrolyzed to its open-ring acid form in a timedependent manner. However, profound concentrations
of lovastatin lactone were measured in cell lysates after
4 h, proving a substantial uptake of the lipophilic form
(Figure 2A, 2C, right). Intracellular lovastatin lactone
concentrations decreased over time reaching 2.9% and
0.2% of the 4-h value in A549 and H358 cells after a 48-h
incubation period (Figure 2A, 2C, right). By contrast,
HPLC analysis yielded low intracellular concentrations of
lovastatin acid, which did not rise concomitantly with the
time-dependent intracellular decrease of the lactone form.
Incubation of cells with the acid form of lovastatin
resulted in constant extracellular concentrations of this
compound and no measurable lactone levels in cell culture
supernatants of both A549 and H358 cells (Figure 2B, 2D,
left).

Impact of lovastatin lactone on COX-2 and
PPARγ expression

Remarkably, intracellular concentrations of the acid
(Figure 2B, 2D, right) were approximately in the same
range as the acid concentrations measured in lactonetreated cells (Figure 2A, 2C, right). Thus, lovastatin acid
was ranging between 0 and 0.5 µmol/g protein in A549
cells and between 0 and 0.3 µmol/g protein in H358
cells following treatment with the acid form (Figure 2B,
2D, right). In lactone-treated cells the acid form ranged
between 0.2 and 0.3 µmol/g protein (A549) and between
0.1 and 0.2 µmol/g protein (H358), respectively (Figure
2A, 2C, right).

In view of several studies indicating COX-2-derived
PGs to confer COX-2-dependent apoptosis by activating
the transcription factor PPARγ, the impact of lovastatin
lactone on COX-2 was assessed in A549 and H358 cells
next.
In fact, lovastatin lactone caused an upregulation of
COX-2 mRNA levels in a time-dependent manner (Figure
3A, 3B) with a rapid induction of COX-2 mRNA after a

in the medium and the cellular fraction by HPLC as described under Materials and Methods. For intracellular levels, lovastatin lactone and
acid levels determined by HPLC were normalized to the respective total cellular protein amounts. Lovastatin lactone and acid measured
in cell culture supernatants are presented as un-normalized raw concentrations. Values are mean ± SEM of n = 3 (A; B, left panel; D), n =

6-h (A549) or 4- and 8-h incubation (H358) and significant
increases at 48 h. To measure mRNA regulations at the
time of functional implications, i.e., loss of viability and
induction of apoptosis, the concentration-dependency
of this effect was evaluated following a 48-h incubation
with the substance, yielding a concentration-dependent
induction of COX-2 mRNA by lovastatin lactone (Figure
3C, 3D).
In line with this data, incubation of cells with
lovastatin lactone was associated with substantial
increases in COX-2 protein levels. In experiments
addressing the time-dependency of this action over a 48-h
incubation period, lovastatin lactone elicited increases of
COX-2 protein within 4 h in both cell lines (Figure 4A,
4B). A concentration-dependency of COX-2 upregulation
by lovastatin was observed in both A549 (Figure 4C) and
H358 cells (Figure 4D).
Finally, analysis of a potential time-dependent
alteration of PPARγ, the primary target of COX-2-

dependent PGs in evoking apoptosis, revealed no
significant alteration on the level of protein expression
(Figure 4A, 4B).

Impact of mevalonic acid on lovastatin lactoneinduced apoptotic cell death and COX-2
expression
To determine whether the lovastatin lactone-elicited
increases of DNA fragmentation and COX-2 expression
were due to inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase, both
effects were investigated in the presence of mevalonic
acid, the direct product of HMG-CoA reductase.
Mevalonic acid tested at 100 µM has been reported to
sufficiently block statin effects [11, 15, 17]. However,
mevalonic acid only partially prevented cytotoxicity
(Figure 5A), DNA fragmentation (Figure 5B) and COX-2

and H358 cells, even when used at a concentration of 500
µM. Mevalonic acid did not inhibit DNA fragmentation
itself (Figure 5B). A minor decrease of viability was even
observed in the presence of the 500-µM concentration in
A549 cells, which was, however, not found in H358 cells
(Figure 5A).

of cells with lovastatin lactone. To evaluate whether a
potential upregulation of PG production was causally
linked to increased COX-2 expression, these experiments
likewise included combined incubation of cells with
lovastatin lactone and the selective COX-2 inhibitor
NS-398. As shown in Figure 6A, 6B, lovastatin lactone
induced significant releases of PGE2, PGD2 and 15d-PGJ2
in both cell lines with all increases being sensitive to NS398.

Impact of lovastatin lactone on PG production

investigate the production of PGs through treatment

Impact of COX-2 and PPARγ on lovastatin
lactone-induced apoptotic cell death

transfection experiments were performed using siRNA
targeting COX-2. Transfection of cells with COX-2
siRNA was shown to interfere with lovastatin lactoneinduced COX-2 protein levels (Figure 8A, 8B, Western
blot images, lower panel) and significantly inhibited
toxicity (Figure 8A, 8B, histograms, upper panel) and
DNA fragmentation (Figure 8C, 8D) elicited by lovastatin
lactone in both cell lines.

To investigate a potential involvement of COX2 and PPARγ in lovastatin lactone-induced apoptotic
cell death, experiments using NS-398 and the PPARγ
antagonist GW9662 were performed. As shown in Figure
7, NS-398 and GW9662 inhibited both toxicity (Figure

lovastatin lactone in each cell line.
To further substantiate the role of de novo expressed

nuclear accumulation of PPARγ by lovastatin lactone was
significantly suppressed by the COX-2 inhibitor NS-398.
Furthermore, a complete reversal of lovastatin lactoneinduced cytosol-to-nucleus translocation of PPARγ was
observed when cells were coincubated with the PPARγ
antagonist GW9662 indicating PPARγ ligand crosslinking
to be involved in this response.
In a second approach, nuclear PPARγ protein levels
from A549 and H358 cells were investigated by Western
blot analyses of proteins in nuclear fractions. Again,
lovastatin lactone was found to increase PPARγ protein
levels in nuclear fractions with the respective upregulation
being sensitive to both NS-398 and GW9662 (Figure 9C).

activation [41-43], was inhibited by NS-398 suggesting
COX-2-dependent PGs generated through lovastatin
lactone treatment to induce the observed activation of
PPARγ. In line with this notion, another study from our
group has recently shown that exogenously added PGD2
and 15d-PGJ2 elicit PPARγ translocation and PPARγdependent apoptosis in A549 and H358 cells, whereas
PGE2 left both events virtually unaltered [33]. These data
are in good agreement with other studies demonstrating
anticancerogenic effects of PGD2 and 15d-PGJ2 to occur
via PPARγ [26, 29, 34-36].
Clearly, the concentrations of lovastatin lactone
causing COX-2 induction and DNA fragmentation
exceed plasma concentrations of lovastatine lactone,
which have been reported to reach a maximum of 0.02
µM after single-dose administration of 80 mg lovastatin
to human volunteers [44]. However, in a dose-escalating
trial of lovastatin in patients with advanced malignancies,
lovastatin administered orally every 6 h for 96 h in 4-week
cycles in doses ranging from 10 mg/m2 to 412 mg/m2
caused peak plasma bioactivity levels of 0.06 to 12.3 µM
[45]. In the same investigation, a dose-limiting toxicity
was not reached and there were no clinically significant
increases in creatine phosphokinase or serum hepatic
aminotransferases levels. Noteworthy, high intracellular
concentrations may be achieved in vivo through longer
exposure times. Accordingly, cancer patients receive
repeated treatment over weeks or months resulting in
cumulative effects of the respective chemotherapy or
radiation therapy [46, 47].
Concerning the upstream events conferring
increased COX-2 expression by lovastatin lactone, it

DISCUSSION
The present study demonstrates induction of COX-2
expression and subsequent activation of PPARγ by COX2-derived PGs as key events within the proapoptotic
action of lovastatin lactone on human lung cancer cells
(for summary see Figure 10).
There are several lines of evidence supporting
this pathway. First, lovastatin lactone caused a profound
upregulation of COX-2 mRNA and protein expression
in the lung cancer cell lines A549 and H358. Second,
treatment of both cell lines with lovastatin lactone
resulted in increases of PGE2, PGD2 and 15d-PGJ2 that
were sensitive to NS-398, thus indicating a functionally
active COX-2 enzyme. Third, specific inhibition of
COX-2 and PPARγ with small molecules suppressed
lovastatin lactone-induced apoptotic cell death. The same
pattern was observed, when COX-2 was suppressed
posttranscriptionally using an siRNA approach. Fourth,
lovastatin lactone-induced translocation of PPARγ from
cytosol to nucleus, an established marker of PPARγ

Figure 10: Proposed mechanism underlying the proapoptotic action of lovastatin lactone on lung cancer cells. Incubation

of lung cancer cells with lovastatin lactone results in profound intracellular levels of the unchanged lactone form. Lovastatin lactone induces
a profound upregulation of COX-2 mRNA and protein expression resulting in increases of PGD2 and 15d-PGJ2, two well-established
activators of the transcription factor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) that elicits apoptosis.

function, may play a role in this context. As a matter of
fact, inhibition of the proteasome has been associated with
upregulation of COX-2 expression [48, 49]. In case of the
proteasome inhibitors MG132, PSI-1 and lactacystin,
induction of COX-2 expression was shown to occur via
enhanced gene transcription rather than prevention of
protein degradation in diverse cells including A549 [49].
Our data indicating the lactone but not the acid
form of lovastatin to elicit apoptotic death of lung
cancer cells are in line with the work of Rao et al. [21]
that challenged the dogma of the ring-open form being
the sole active form of lovastatin. In this investigation
lovastatin lactone was shown to induce growth inhibitory
effects on human breast cancer cells by inhibition of
the proteasome, whereas pravastatin, a ring-open and
therefore direct HMG-CoA reductase-inhibitory statin
with a structure and potency similar to lovastatin acid,
did not elicit comparable effects [21]. In another study,
mevastatin, which is likewise a statin prodrug with closedring structure, induced degenerative changes and reduced
viability of differentiated murine neuroblastoma cells by
inhibiting proteasome activity, whereas pravastatin neither
affected degeneration and viability nor proteasome activity
[50]. However, apart from these studies substantiating our
observations, the cytotoxic action of the lactone form
toward cancer cells appears to be a cell type-dependent
phenomenon. Thus, in contrast to the data presented
here, lovastatin acid has been previously shown to elicit
apoptosis in various pediatric cancer cells and squamous
cell carcinomas, whereas the lactone form was inactive in
this respect [51].
A reason for the differential effects of lactone
and acid forms on viability may lie in their diverse and
variable uptake mechanisms by different cell types. In
this context it is worthy to note that lovastatin lactone is
almost three orders of magnitude more lipophilic than its
active ring-open hydroxy-acid form [1, 52]. As a matter
of fact, increased lipophilicity of the lactone is reflected
by its higher potential to cross cellular membranes nonselectively by passive diffusion as compared to its ringopen hydroxy-acid form [1]. As shown for hepatocytes,
lipophilic statins enter the cells by passive diffusion,
whereas hydrophilic statins require a carrier-mediated
uptake [1, 53].
In the present investigation HPLC analyses of
lovastatin lactone-treated cells revealed profound
intracellular levels of the lactone with initial
concentrations being 51- (A549) or 136-fold (H358) above
the corresponding intracellular concentrations of the ringopen acid form, the hydrolysis product of the lactone
prodrug. These data are in line with a study by Kumar
et al. [50] that even exclusively found the ring-closed
form of mevastatin in neuronal cells incubated with the
lipophilic prodrug. On the other hand, lovastatin lactone
was not detected in both A549 and H358 cells treated
with the acid form. On the basis of these data proving
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

a substantial uptake of the lipophilic prodrug form, it is
most likely that the lactone itself elicits COX-2 expression
and apoptotic response of lactone-treated cells. This view
is substantiated by the finding that virtually identical
intracellular levels of the acid form were measured in cells
treated with equimolar concentrations of either lactone
or acid. Thus, if these low intracellular lovastatin acid
levels, probably resulting from intracellular conversion,
were primarily responsible for apoptosis induction by the
lactone, incubation of cells with lovastatin acid should be
likewise expected to elicit apoptosis, which could not be
confirmed here.
In apparent contrast to these considerations,
mevalonic acid, the product of HMG-CoA-reductasecatalyzed reaction, was shown to suppress both apoptotic
response and COX-2 expression by the lactone. On the
one hand, these data imply at least to some extent a role
of HMG-CoA reductase inhibition in both actions of the
lactone. Thus, intracellular generation of active inhibitors
of HMG-CoA reductase, other than the ring-open hydroxyacid form, may contribute to the effects of lovastatin
lactone observed in this study. These metabolites may
derive from sequential oxidation and hydrolysis of the
respective lactone rather than from oxidation of the
active ring-open hydroxy-acid form (for review see [1])
and have been previously found to circulate in serum of
lactone prodrug-treated subjects [54-56]. On the other
hand, mevalonic acid may also interfere with events
prior to lovastatin lactone-induced COX-2 expression
and apoptosis. Accordingly, Rao et al. [21] have shown
that mevalonate abrogates the lovastatin lactone-induced
inhibition of the proteasome and G1 arrest. In line with
this notion, mevalonate completely abrogated apoptosis
by lactacystin, an established proteasome inhibitor [21].
A few years later, Kumar et al. [50] using neuroblastoma
cells were able to demonstrate that mevalonic acid lactone
completely prevents mevastatin-induced degeneration and
decreased viability by reducing the uptake of mevastatin
and by blocking its action on proteasome activity.
Collectively, this study demonstrates a hitherto
unknown proapoptotic mechanism of lovastatin lactone
comprising upregulation of COX-2 expression and
activation of PPARγ by de novo synthesized COX-2derived PGs. Moreover, our results challenge the widespread view of the acid form being the sole active form
of statins.

Cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with
10% heat-inactivated FCS, 100 U/ml penicillin and 100
µg/ml streptomycin. Cells were grown in a humidified
incubator at 37°C and 5% CO2. All incubations with
test substances were performed in serum-free DMEM.
Lovastatin lactone, NS-398 and GW9662 were dissolved
in DMSO and diluted with PBS. Maximal DMSO
content in experiments with substance combinations did
not exceed 0.2% (v/v) DMSO. As vehicle control PBS
containing the respective concentration of DMSO was
used. Salts of lovastatin acid and mevalonic acid were
dissolved in medium. Following resuscitation of frozen
cultures none of the cell lines was cultured longer than 6
months.

Western blot analysis
For Western blot analyses, A549 or H358 cells
were seeded in 6-well plates at a density of 2 x 105 cells
per well, grown for 24 h, and subsequently incubated
with vehicle or test substances for the indicated time
periods. Proteins were isolated and analysed as described
previously [26, 28, 29]. In brief, following incubation,
cells were washed with PBS, harvested and lysed in
solubilization buffer (50 mM HEPES, 150 mM NaCl, 1
mM EDTA, 1% (v/v) Triton® X-100, 10% (v/v) glycerol,
1 mM PMSF, 1 mM orthovanadate, 1 µg/ml leupeptin, 10

was achieved by optical scanning and quantifying
using the Quantity One 1-D Analysis Software (Biorad,
Munich, Germany). For quantification of cell lysates
all densitometric analyses were normalized to ß-actin.
Densitometric quantification of nuclear PPARγ was carried
out by normalization to lamin B1. Apoptosis parameters

chamber and grown for 24 h. Following incubation with
test substances or vehicle, cells were washed and fixed
in 4% (v/v) formaldehyde. Subsequently, fixed cells
were incubated with a PPARγ antibody (Biomol GmbH,
Hamburg, Germany) and a lamin A/C antibody (New
England Biolabs GmbH, Frankfurt/Main, Germany) for
detection of cell nuclei. Secondary antibodies were a goat
anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor® 555 labelled IgG for detection of
PPARγ and a goat anti-mouse Alexa Fluor® 488 labelled
IgG for detection of lamin A/C (Life Technologies
Corporation, Darmstadt, Germany). All antibodies were
diluted in PBS containing 0.3% (v/v) Triton® X-100 and
1% (v/v) FCS. Cells were observed under a fluorescence
microscope (Axio Scope.A1, Carl Zeiss Microscopy
GmbH, Jena, Germany). Shapes of nuclear regions were
merged to images of PPARγ-stained cells. Fluorescence
intensity of PPARγ within lamin A/C-positive spots was
quantified for 20 nuclei per sample. All images were
analyzed using ZEN 2012 software from Zeiss (Jena,
Germany).

Analyses of nuclear PPARγ by Western blot

Determination of COX-2-dependently synthesized
PGs

For Western blot analyses of nuclear PPARγ cells
were seeded in 10-cm dishes at a density of 2 x 106 cells
per well, grown for 24 h, and subsequently incubated
with vehicle or test substances for the indicated time
periods. Analysis of nuclear PPARγ was performed as
previously described [33] with slight modifications. In
brief, following incubation, cells were suspended in PBS
containing 6.2 mM NaF, 12.7 mM ß-glycerophosphate,
15.5 mM p-nitrophenyl phosphate and 0.84 mM sodium
orthovanadate. After a centrifugation step, pellets were
resuspended in 1 ml of a hypotonic buffer (20 mM
HEPES, pH 7.5, 5 mM NaF, 10 µM sodium molybdate,
0.1 mM EDTA). Afterwards, cells were allowed to swell
on ice for 15 min, and 50 µl of a 10% (w/v) Nonidet® P-40
solution was added to each tube. Following centrifugation
of the homogenate, supernatants were carefully rinsed,
and nuclear pellets were resuspended in 60 µl of complete
lysis buffer containing 50 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mM
NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1% (v/v) Triton® X-100, 10% (v/v)
glycerol, 0.5 mM DTT and 0.1% (w/v) SDS. Thereafter,
tubes were shaken on ice for 30 min and a debris spin
out was performed by centrifugation at 14,000 x g for 10
min. Supernatants were used for determination of nuclear
protein by Western blot as described under Western blot
analysis. As immunochemical characterisation of nuclear
origin the membranes were rehybridized using a lamin B1
antibody.

Cells seeded in 24-well plates at a density of 2 x
105 cells per well and grown for 24 h were preincubated
with NS-398 (1 µM) or its vehicle for 1 h. Thereafter,
cells were incubated with vehicle or lovastatin lactone
in the presence or absence of NS-398 for another 24 h.
The final volume of the supernatant was 300 µl per well.
Afterwards, cell culture media were removed and analyzed
for PGE2, PGD2 and 15d-PGJ2 using enzyme immunoassay
kits (PGE2, PGD2: Cayman Chemical, Ann Arbor, MI,
USA; 15d-PGJ2: Enzo Life Sciences). For indication of
percent control PG levels were normalized to whole cell
protein and subsequently expressed as percent of vehicle
control (100%).

Cell viability and DNA fragmentation
Cells seeded at a density of 5 x 103 cells per well in
96-well flat-bottom microplates (viability) or at 1 x 105
cells per well in 24-well plates (DNA fragmentation) and
grown for 24 h were used for incubations. Cell viability
and DNA fragmentation were analysed using WST-1
test and Cell Death Detection ELISAPLUS kit (both from
Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany) according to
the manufacturer´s instructions, respectively.

for 24 h. For determination of extracellular lovastatin,
500 µl of acetonitrile were added to 500 µl of medium.
The mixture was centrifuged for 7 min (20,000 x g)
before chromatographic analysis. For determination
of intracellular lovastatin, cells were trypsinized,
centrifuged, and lysed by addition of 255 µl of water
and sonification. An aliquot of 5 µl was used for
protein determination. Finally, 250 µl acetonitrile were
added for chromatographic determination using 25
µM mevastatin as internal standard. HPLC analyses
were performed using a Prominence system (Shimadzu
Deutschland GmbH, Duisburg, Germany) consisting of
two high-pressure binary gradient pumps (LC-20AD)
and a diode array detector (Nexera X2 SPD-M30A). The
chromatographic separation was carried out at 30°C on
a Multospher®120 column (RP 18, AQ-5µm, 250 x 3
mm, CS-Chromatographie Service GmbH, Langerwehe,
Germany) with a precolumn (RP 18, AQ-5µm, 20 x 3

a gradient elution using (A) 0.1% (m/V) trifluoroacetic
acid in bidistilled water and (B) acetonitrile: 34% A and
66% B, linear increase to 99% B in 15 min, holding for
4 min. The detection of the analytes was performed by
UV absorbance at 240 nm. As the samples, calibration
standards (0.1 up to 250 µmol/l) were likewise prepared
with bidistilled water for measurements of intracellular
lovastatin or with DMEM for extracellular lovastatin
concentrations.
