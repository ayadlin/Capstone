Abstract

Author Manuscript

The serine protease inhibitor, elafin, is a critical component of the epithelial barrier against
neutrophil elastase (NE). Elafin is downregulated in the majority of breast cancer cell lines
compared to normal human mammary epithelial cells (HMECs). Here, we evaluated the role of
elafin and NE on proliferation and tumorigenesis. Elafin is induced in growth factor deprived
HMECs as they enter a quiescent (G0) state, suggesting that elafin is a counterbalance against the
mitogenic effects of NE in G0 HMECs. Stable knockdown of elafin compromises the ability of
HMECs to maintain G0-arrest during long-term growth factor deprivation; this effect can be
reversed by re-expression of wild-type elafin, but not elafin-M25G lacking protease inhibitory
function. These results suggest that NE, which is largely contributed by activated neutrophils in
the tumor microenvironment, may be negatively regulating the ability of elafin to arrest cells in
G0. In fact when purified NE was added to elafin knockdown HMECs, these cells demonstrated
greater sensitivity to the growth promoting effects of purified NE. Activation of ERK signaling,
downstream of toll-like receptor 4, was essential to the mitogenic effect of NE on HMECs. These
findings were next translated to patient samples, and immunohistochemical analysis of normal
breast tissue revealed robust elafin expression in the mammary epithelium; however, elafin
expression was dramatically downregulated in a significant proportion of human breast tumor
specimens. The loss of elafin expression during breast cancer progression may promote tumor
growth as a consequence of increased NE-activity. To address the role of NE in mammary

Introduction

Author Manuscript

Elafin, an endogenous serine protease inhibitor, is an important component of the epithelial
shield against excessive neutrophil elastase (NE) activity (1). NE, a potent serine protease, is
normally synthesized in the bone marrow and sequestered within the azurophilic granules of
neutrophils. The major physiological function of NE is the intracellular destruction of
pathogens following phagocytosis at sites of infection (2). Activated neutrophils also secrete
NE into the extracellular environment. In this context, NE has important roles in the
antimicrobial, inflammatory, and wound healing responses. Under normal physiological
conditions, serine protease inhibitors, including elafin, rapidly quench NE activity,
contributing to the resolution of inflammation and preserving tissue integrity (3). Imbalance
between NE and its inhibitors is implicated in the pathogenesis of a wide range of diseases
characterized by excessive or chronic inflammation (4).

Author Manuscript

Elafin downregulation was observed in several inflammatory diseases, including acute
respiratory distress syndrome (5), inflammatory bowel disease (6), and acute lung injury (7).
In these studies, elafin downregulation correlates with increased NE activity and disease
progression. In mouse models, constitutive elafin overexpression protected against acute
lung injury (8), reduced pulmonary hypertension following chronic hypoxia (9), diminished
tissue destruction associated with experimental colitis (6), and improved heart function after
viral myocarditis (10) or myocardial infarction (11). The available evidence supports an
important role for elafin in suppressing NE-activity and mitigating the pathogenesis of
inflammatory disease.

Author Manuscript

Several studies suggest that loss of elafin-mediated control of NE activity is a feature of
malignant growth. Elafin downregulation was observed in poorly-differentiated compared to
well-differentiated squamous cell carcinomas (12, 13). Elafin expression is lost in melanoma
and breast cancer cell lines compared to normal melanocytes and human mammary
epithelial cells (HMECs) (14, 15). The transcription factor C/EBPβ is required for elafin
expression in HMECs. Accumulation of a truncated, dominant-negative isoform of C/EBPβ
accounts for elafin downregulation in breast cancer cell lines (16). We previously reported
that ectopic expression of elafin induced apoptosis in Rb negative and growth arrest in Rbpositive breast cancer cell lines (17), suggesting that elafin has tumor suppressive properties
in the context of breast cancer.
In the present study, we initially sought to understand the normal regulation and role of
endogenously expressed elafin in HMECs, as well as the consequence of elafin

downregulation on critical aspects of tumorigenesis. We observed dramatic upregulation of
elafin in quiescence (G0) HMECs, leading us to hypothesize that elafin is a critical
counterbalance against the mitogenic effects of NE. Using HMECs as a model system, the
results support a role for elafin in opposing the NE-induced proliferation. We observed
dramatic downregulation of elafin expression in patient-derived breast tumor specimens
compared to elafin expression in the normal mammary epithelium, suggesting compromised
control of NE-activity is indeed a feature of breast tumorigenesis. Finally, we investigated
the implications of deregulated NE-activity on tumor growth in the C3(1)TAg mouse model
of mammary tumorigenesis. In this model, NE knockout significantly reduced tumor growth
and proliferation. A therapeutic approach designed to restore appropriate control of NEactivity may lead to the inhibition of tumor growth in breast cancer patients.

Elafin is Highly Expressed in Quiescent HMECs

Author Manuscript

Primary (i.e mortal) 81N, 70N, and 76N HMECs were cultured under growth factordeficient conditions and harvested at 6-hour intervals for 48 hours to examine the expression
of endogenous elafin during growth arrest. DNA content analysis revealed that HMECs
were progressively arrested in G0/G1 phase. Complete arrest was observed between 24 and
36 hours of continuous culture (Figure 1A). Western blot analysis showed dramatic
upregulation of elafin over the growth factor deprivation time course (Figure 1B),
corresponding to the accumulation of HMECs in G0/G1 phase. Immunofluorescence
analysis of Ki67, which is specifically downregulated in quiescent (G0) cells (18), confirms
that growth factor deprivation induces G0 (and not G1) arrest in HMECs (Figure 1C). Elafin
immunofluorescence demonstrates increased cytoplasmic staining intensity following
growth factor deprivation (Figure 1D).
Elafin has primarily been characterized as a secreted protein; therefore we next examined
elafin levels in conditioned media by ELISA. The concentration of elafin in the conditioned
media of 81N, 70N, and 76N HMECs cultured in the presence of growth factors for 24
hours was 2.6–2.9 ng/mL. Significantly higher concentrations of elafin were observed in
HMECs cultured in growth factor-deprived medium: 4.0–6.3 ng/mL at 24 hours and 7.1–
11.5 ng/mL at 48 hours (Figure 1E).
Quantitative RT-PCR (qPCR) analysis revealed that elafin is highly induced at the mRNA
level under growth factor deprivation conditions, increasing 12- to 178-fold at 24 hours and
165- to 240-fold at 48 hours compared to the level of elafin mRNA in HMECs cultured in
growth factor-containing medium (Figure 1F).

Author Manuscript

Previously, we reported that accumulation of a truncated, dominant negative isoform of C/
EBPβ represses elafin expression in breast cancer cell lines (16). We next interrogated if C/
EBPβ elements in the elafin promoter are necessary for elafin upregulation in G0 HMECs by
luciferase reporter analysis of the elafin promoter. The results revealed that elafin
upregulation in HMECs was dependent on C/EBPβ sites 4 and 5, which we previously
identified (16) (Figure S1A). Lastly, in the immortalized HMECs 76NF2V, knockdown of

C/EBPβ (Figure S1B) prevented elafin upregulation following growth factor deprivation
(Figure S1C).
Rb-Deficient HMECs are Incapable of G0 Arrest and Fail to Upregulate Elafin

Author Manuscript

To determine if Rb-dependent G0-arrest is required for elafin expression, we examined a
panel of immortalized HMECs (19) that express both p53 and Rb (76NF2V), lack p53
(76NE6), or lack Rb and related pocket proteins (76NE7). Growth factor deprivation (GFD)
for 48 hours resulted in the downregulation of Ki67 in 76NE6 and 76NF2V cells but not
76NE7 cells (Figure 2A). Maintenance of Ki67 expression in growth factor-deprived 76NE7
cells confirmed that loss of the Rb checkpoint eliminates the ability of HMECs to arrest in
G0. 76NE6 and 76NF2V progressively arrested in G0/G1 over the 48-hour GFD time course
and upregulated elafin (Figure S2, A and B), similar to primary HMECs (Figure 1, A and
B). 76NE7 cells were incapable of elafin upregulation compared to 76NE6 and 76NF2V
cells (Figure 2B) and they arrested in the G2-phase (not G1 phase) of the cell cycle over the
48-hour GFD time-course (Figure S2A). Furthermore, immortalized HMECs
asynchronously proliferating or arrested in the G1-phase following treatment with lovastatin,
S-phase following treatment with aphidicolin, or G2/M phase following treatment with
nocodazole were unable to upregulate elafin compared to growth factor deprived, G0arrested 76NE6 and 76NF2V; Rb-deficient 76NE7 cells were unable to upregulate elafin in
response to any of the conditions examined (Figure 2C).

Author Manuscript

Similar results were obtained using the immortalized 81N HMEC system; Rb-deficient
81NE7 HMECs accumulated in the G2 phase of the cell cycle (Figure S2C) and cannot
upregulate elafin (Figure S2D) following GFD, compared to Rb-expressing 81NE6 and
parental 81N HMECs. Furthermore, Rb knockdown renders 76NF2V and 76NE6 incapable
of arrest in G0/G1 phase (Figure 2D) and elafin upregulation (Figure 2E) following GFD.
Taken together, these results demonstrated that Rb-dependent G0 arrest is required for elafin
upregulation in growth factor deprived HMECs, suggesting a role for elafin in growth
control.
Elafin Knockdown HMECs Circumvent G0 Arrest and Proliferate in the Absence of Growth
Factors

Author Manuscript

To examine the role of elafin in maintenance of G0 arrest, elafin was knocked-down in
76NE6 (Figure 3A) and 81NE6 (Figure S3A) HMECs and the kinetics of cell proliferation
were assessed under growth factor-deficient conditions (Figure 3B). Since FBS contains an
abundance of serine protease inhibitors, cells were cultured in media lacking supplemental
FBS. Both 76NE6 and 81NE6 elafin-knockdown cell lines exhibited modest but significant
growth factor-independent proliferation with doubling times between 66 and 81 hours, while
control cells exhibited complete growth cessation after only 24 hours in growth factordepleted medium (Figure 3C).
To verify the specificity of elafin knockdown and examine the importance of elafinmediated protease inhibition in this system, we complemented 76NE6 elafin-knockdown
cells with wild-type elafin (sensitive to shRNA downregulation), shRNA-resistant-elafin,
and shRNA-resistant-M25G-elafin (the M25G mutation inactivates the protease inhibitor

domain) (20) (Figures 3D and S3B). Elafin-knockdown 76NE6 cells demonstrated an
approximate doubling in cell number compared to controls following 144 hours of growth
factor deprivation (Figure 3E). Complementation of elafin-knockdown 76NE6 cells with
wild-type elafin, but not M25G-elafin, reduced cell number to the level of controls (Figure
3E). These experiments revealed a critical role of elafin-mediated protease inhibition in the
maintenance of G0 arrest.
Elafin Knockdown HMECs Demonstrate Enhanced Sensitivity to the Growth-Promoting
Effect of Exogenous NE

Author Manuscript

The inability of elafin-M25G to inhibit the growth factor independent proliferation of elafin
knockdown HMECs (Figure 3E) suggests a critical role for its deregulated protease activity.
Notably, the level of growth factor independent proliferation observed in elafin knockdown
HMECs was modest (Figure 3C) consistent with the relatively low levels of NE activity in
these cells (21). Since in the tumor microenvironment the majority of NE is contributed by
activated neutrophils (22, 23), we next interrogated the ability of exogenous NE to induce
the proliferation of elafin knockdown HMECs (Figure 4). In this experiment, elafinknockdown and control 76NE6 cells were growth factor deprived for 24 hours, and purified
NE was added directly to the media as described (24). Cell density was measured using the
MTT assay 48 hours after addition of NE (Figure 4A). Compared to controls, the elafinknockdown 76NE6 cells stimulated with NE at concentrations of 1–8 nM demonstrated
significantly greater sensitivity to the growth promoting effect of exogenous NE (Figure
4B).

Author Manuscript

The ability of NE to induce proliferation was dose-dependent. Elafin-knockdown 76NE6
cells were sensitive to the growth-promoting effect of 2 nM NE, whereas elafin-expressing
controls were not (Figure 4C). Complementation of elafin-knockdown 76NE6 cells with
shRNA-resistant-elafin, but not shRNA-resistant-M25G-elafin, attenuated proliferation
induced by 2 nM NE (Figure 4C). No differences were observed in this experiment between
groups not treated with NE because cell number was assessed following only 72 hours of
growth factor deprivation. [Significant differences in cell number were not seen in elafinknockdown HMECs until 120 hours of growth factor deprivation (Figure 3C).]
Pharmacological inhibitors of NE activity sivelestat and GW311616 inhibited NE-induced
proliferation in 76NE6 cells (Figure S4, A and B); further evidencing that the mitogeniceffect of NE is dependent on NE-activity and not contaminants in the NE preparation.
These findings provided evidence that elafin is an important component of the epithelial
shield against deregulated NE activity.

NE Induces Proliferation through TLR4-Dependent Activation of ERK Signaling
Microarray analysis identified differentially expressed genes between elafin-knockdown and
control 76NE6 cells following 0, 48, and 168 hours of growth factor deprivation (Figure
S5A). Upregulation of the immediate early response gene, EGR1, at the 48-hour time point
was of particular interest given the previously identified role of EGR1 in cell cycle re-entry
of G0-arrested HMECs (25, 26). We validated the upregulation of EGR1 in 76NE6 elafinknockdown cells by qPCR (Figure S5B).

The ERK signaling pathway is known to control EGR1 transcription (26). Addition of NE
(10nM) to growth factor deprived 76NE6 cells resulted in activation of ERK
phosphorylation that peaked within 15 to 30 minutes (Figure S6A). Upregulation of ERK
target genes EGR1 and FOS were observed 3 hours after the addition of NE to growtharrested 76NE6 cells (Figure S6B). Addition of the MEK1/2 selective inhibitor U0126 and
MEK1 siRNA effectively inhibited ERK phosphorylation following the addition of NE to
growth-arrested 76NE6 cells (Figure S6C) and consistently attenuated NE-induced
proliferation (Figure S6, D and E).

Author Manuscript

Given the rapidity of ERK activation following the addition of NE, we hypothesized that an
extracellular receptor mediates the mitogenic effect of NE on HMECs. TLR4 (27), PAR2
(28), and EGFR (29) have all been implicated in NE-induced ERK activation. We observed
that knockdown of TLR4 reproducibly abrogated ERK activation in growth factor-deprived
76NE6 and 81NE6 cells (Figure 4D) following the addition of 10 nM NE (sufficient to
overwhelm endogenous elafin and induce maximal proliferation in both 76NE6 and 81NE6
cells) and attenuated NE-induced proliferation (Figure 6E).
These findings suggested that the mitogenic activity of NE in quiescent HMECs is
dependent on TLR4-induced ERK activation.
Elafin is Downregulated in Breast Tumor Specimens Compared to the Normal Mammary
Epithelium

Author Manuscript

To examine the physiological relevance of elafin expression in human breast cancer, we
initially measured elafin protein levels in 36 breast cancer cell lines and found that elafin
expression was absent from all breast tumor cell lines examined as compared to 76NE6 cells
(Figure 5A).

Author Manuscript

Next, we translated these in vitro findings to patient-derived tissue specimens, where we
examined elafin expression by IHC in normal breast tissue from reduction mammoplasty
(n=15) and invasive breast carcinoma (n=202) using a highly specific monoclonal antibody
against elafin (Hycult, clone: TRAB/2F) (30). Based on the absence of elafin in breast
cancer cell lines, we hypothesized that elafin expression is downregulated in human breast
cancer specimens compared to the normal mammary epithelium. Supporting our hypothesis,
elafin was expressed within the epithelial compartment of the normal mammary gland
(Figure 5B), but was absent from the epithelial component of human breast tumors (Figure
5C). In some cases, infiltrating leukocytes in the tumor microenvironment expressed high
levels of elafin contrasting with the absence of elafin within the tumor epithelium (Figure
5C). Quantification revealed a significantly lower frequency of elafin positive cells in breast
tumors specimens compared the normal mammary epithelium (Figure 5D).
Our IHC analysis revealed that elafin was significantly downregulated in human breast
tumors, suggesting that the epithelial shield against NE-activity is compromised during
breast tumorigenesis.

NE Knockout Reduces Tumor Growth and Proliferation in the C3(1)TAg Model of TNBC

Author Manuscript

Next, we set out to understand the significance of deregulated NE-activity in a mouse model
of breast tumorigenesis. We hypothesized that deregulated NE is capable of promoting
breast tumor growth. Given the correlation between high levels of NE and ER/PR-negative
status (31), we chose to test this hypothesis in a mouse model of triple-receptor negative
breast cancer (TNBC). The C3(1)TAg mouse model has been shown to give rise to TNBC
and is molecularly similar to basal-like breast cancer in humans (32–35). C3(1)TAg mice
were crossed with the previously established NE knockout mice (2), both were maintained
in the FVB/N background (Figure S7).

Author Manuscript

C3(1)TAg x NE+/+ and C3(1)TAg x NE−/− cohorts were followed for tumor initiation and
growth was followed until the tumor exceeded the maximal allowable size based on the
requirements of the institutional review board. The doubling time of each tumor was
calculated by application of the exponential growth model. Tumors in NE−/− mice
demonstrated a significantly slower growth rate compared to tumors in NE+/+ mice (Figure
6A). To determine if the difference in the tumor growth rate was due to altered proliferation,
tumors were subjected to qPCR analysis of the proliferation markers Mki67 and Melk
(Figure 6B) and IHC analysis of BrdU incorporation (Figure 6C). The mRNA levels of both
Mki67 and Melk were significantly suppressed in C3(1)TAg x NE−/− genotype tumors
compared to C3(1)TAg x NE+/+ genotype tumors (Figure 6B). Significantly less BrdU
incorporation was observed in tumors arising in NE−/− genotype mice compared to tumors
arising in NE+/+ genotype mice (Figure 6D). IHC analysis of BrdU incorporation was also
performed on the contralateral mammary gland of tumor bearing mice (Figure 6E).
Quantification revealed significantly lower levels of proliferation in the mammary glands of
C3(1)TAg x NE−/− genotype mice compared to C3(1)TAg x NE+/+ genotype mice (Figure
6F). The results presented here are consistent with decreased proliferation in C3(1)TAg x
NE−/− genotype tumors compared to C3(1)TAg x NE+/+ genotype tumors. Overall, the data
presented here provides direct in vivo evidence that NE enhances tumor growth in a mouse
model of TNBC.

Discussion

Author Manuscript

In this study, we examined the regulation/role of endogenously expressed elafin and the
consequence of deregulated NE-activity on proliferation and tumor growth. Initially, we
observed that elafin is upregulated at the transcription level in G0 HMECs (Figure 1F),
which resulted in its intracellular accumulation (Figure 1B) and increased secretion into
conditioned media (Figure 1E). Elafin transactivation required the transcription factor C/
EBPβ (Figure S1) and Rb-dependent cell cycle checkpoint control (Figure 2). Rb and C/
EBPβ are essential to the control of proliferation and differentiation within the mammary
gland (36, 37). Physical interaction with Rb was previously shown to be critical for C/EBPβ
DNA binding (38) and may play a role in the regulation of elafin expression in HMECs. The
Rb and C/EBPβ pathways are commonly deregulated in human cancers, likely accounting
for elafin downregulation during breast tumorigenesis (16, 39)
The upregulation of elafin in G0 HMECs (Figure 1) suggested a role for elafin in normal
growth control. Elafin is an important component of the epithelial shield against excessive

NE activity (1). The conventionally understood role of deregulated NE activity in tumor
progression is promotion of cell invasion and metastasis through extracellular matrix
degradation and the cleavage of adhesion molecules (40). However, several NE-specific
substrates have recently been identified with important roles in cell proliferation. For
example, NE-mediated degradation of insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1) increased
phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) activity such that NE knockout reduced downstream Akt
activation and tumor cell proliferation in the loxP-Stop-loxP K-rasG12D mouse model of
lung cancer, (22). NE was also been implicated in cleavage of cyclin E into low-molecular
weight isoforms capable of hyperactivating cyclin-dependent kinase 2, enhancing cell
proliferation and inducing tumor formation in mouse models (41, 42).

Author Manuscript

We hypothesized that elafin is an important counterbalance against the mitogenic effects of
NE-activity. Elafin knockdown HMECs proliferated in the absence of growth factors
(Figure 3C). This effect could be ameliorated by reconstitution of wild type but not protease
inhibitor domain mutant elafin, suggesting that deregulated serine protease activity underlies
growth factor independent proliferation in elafin knockdown HMECs (Figure 3E). The level
of proliferation observed in elafin knockdown HMECs was relatively modest and only
evident following prolonged growth factor deprivation, consistent with the relatively low
levels of NE activity in this HMEC system (21). In the tumor microenvironment, the
majority of NE is contributed by activated neutrophils (23). To model this, we added
purified NE to the growth factor deficient culture medium of HMECs, resulting in a robust,
dose-dependent increase in cell proliferation. In this system, elafin knockdown HMECs
demonstrated increased sensitivity to the mitogenic effect of NE compared to elafin
expressing controls (Figures 4B).

Author Manuscript

In models of inflammatory disease, the addition of exogenous NE enhanced cell
proliferation both in vitro and in vivo (24, 43, 44). The concentrations of NE resulting in a
physiological response in vitro varies between studies; proliferation was induced in airway
smooth muscle cell by addition of 0.35–1.7 nM NE (44), in keratinocytes by addition of 0.1–
33 nM NE (24), and in lung fibroblasts by addition of 3.5–862 nM NE (29). In the present
study, the concentrations of NE utilized to induce proliferation in HMECs ranged from 1–10
nM, which is comparable to previously published studies. Possible explanations for the
variability in NE-concentration required to induce cell proliferation in vitro include:
differences in the source/activity of the NE, the sensitivity of the cell lines, and the
concentration of exogenous serine protease inhibitors in the culture medium.

Author Manuscript

In our HMEC system, we found that activation of the ERK signaling pathway (Figure S6A)
was required for the mitogenic effect of NE on HMECs (Figure S6D). This observation was
consistent with previous reports demonstrating the activation of ERK signaling following
addition of exogenous NE (29). NE-induced activation of TLR4 was previously reported
(27). In our HMEC model system, knockdown of TLR4 completely inhibited NE-induced
ERK activation (Figure 4D) and proliferation (Figure 4E). Breast tumor cell lines are known
to express TLR4 (45), suggesting that deregulated NE activity may be an important
endogenous activator of TLR4, downstream ERK signaling, and proliferation throughout
breast tumorigenesis. We have also examined the ERK signaling pathway is breast cancer
patients and find that NE positive tumor associated neutrophils correlate with the

phosphorylation of ERK effector p90RSK and Rb (not shown), recapitulating our cell line
data presented here.
In this study, we demonstrate for the first time that elafin is indeed downregulated during
breast tumorigenesis through IHC-analysis of patient-derived normal and malignant breast
tissue (Figure 5D). Our in vitro results suggest that loss of elafin eliminates a critical
counterbalance against the mitogenic effect of deregulated NE-activity. However, in vitro
studies fail to completely recapitulate the complex interactions between the tumor epithelial
and stromal compartments. We used the C3 (1) TAG mouse model to directly investigate the
role of NE in proliferation and found that, NE knockout in the C3(1)TAg mouse model of
mammary tumorigenesis suppressed proliferation (Figure 6D) and reduced the kinetics of
tumor growth (Figure 6A) compared to NE expressing controls.

Author Manuscript

Extensive experimental evidence has demonstrated that the ability of tumor cells to recruit
and manipulate non-malignant cell types, including leukocytes, governs their malignant
growth potential. The cellular constituents of the tumor stroma are not susceptible to many
of the selective pressures driving therapeutic resistance in tumor cells. Therefore therapeutic
modalities targeting critical microenvironmental mediators of tumor progression may yield
durable anti-tumor responses alone or in combination with existing therapies.
Pharmacological inhibitors of NE have been developed for the treatment of inflammatory
lung disease (46) and could be evaluated as a therapeutic approach to reduce breast tumor
growth.

blocked with 1.5% normal goat serum and incubated overnight at 4°C with primary
antibody: mouse monoclonal antibody to elafin (clone TRAB/2F; Hycult) diluted 1:200, rat
monoclonal antibody to BrdU (clone BU1/75 [ICR1]; AbD Serotec) diluted 1:1000, and rat
monoclonal antibody to Ly6G ([Gr-1] clone 1A8; BD Biosciences) diluted 1:1000. Slides
were developed using the VECTASTAIN Elite ABC Kit (mouse or rabbit IgG) followed by
DAB substrate (Vector) and counterstained with hematoxylin (DAKO). For BrdU and Ly6G
primary antibodies, biotin-conjugated rabbit-anti-rat secondary antibody (Abcam) was
substituted for the secondary goat anti-mouse antibody included in the VECTASTAIN kit at
a concentration of 1:2000. Evaluation was performed with a Leica DM light microscope
using the 40x optical lens. Image acquisition was performed using a SPOT Imaging
Solutions camera and SPOT Advanced software.

Mice

Author Manuscript

The generation of C3(1)TAg (32) and NE knockout (2) mice were previously described. The
NE knockout mice, originally in C57BL/6 were backcrossed to FVB/N strain of mice (same
as the C3(1)Tag) for 12 generations. Tumors arising in the C3(1)TAg x NE−/− and
C3(1)TAg x NE+/+ virgin female mice were measured bi-weekly using Vernier caliper.
Mice were sacrificed, according to institutional guidelines, when tumor reached the
maximum allowable size. Two hours prior to sacrifice the mice were injected
intraperitoneally with 100 mg BrdU/kg body weight. The tumor was excised, half was fixed
in formalin and paraffin embedding for IHC analysis and the other half was snap frozen in
liquid nitrogen for mRNA extraction. The contralateral mammary gland was fixed in
formalin and paraffin embedding for IHC analysis.
Statistical Considerations

Author Manuscript

All experiments were performed at least in triplicate. The results of each experiment are
reported as the mean of experimental replicates. Error bars represent the standard deviation
from the mean. If not otherwise indicated, pairwise comparisons were analyzed using the
unpaired 2-sided t-test (GraphPad Prism). For all tests, p<0.05 was considered significant.
