BACKGROUND. In men with prostate cancer, gonadotropin-releasing hormone
(GnRH) agonists increase fat mass, decrease insulin sensitivity, and increase
triglycerides, features that are shared with metabolic syndrome. To the authors’
knowledge, however, less is known regarding the effects of GnRH agonists on
other attributes of the metabolic syndrome.

METHODS. In an open-label prospective study, 26 men with recurrent or locally
advanced prostate cancer were treated with leuprolide for 12 months. Outcomes
included changes in blood pressure, body composition, lipids, adipocytokines,

by 36.4  5.9% from baseline to Month 3 and remained significantly elevated
through Month 12 (P < .001). Resistin and C-reactive protein levels did not
change significantly.

CONCLUSIONS. The term metabolic syndrome does not appear to adequately
describe the effects of GnRH agonists in men with prostate cancer. In contrast to
the metabolic syndrome, GnRH agonists increase subcutaneous fat mass, HDL
cholesterol, and adiponectin, and do not alter the waist-to-hip ratio, blood pressure, or C-reactive protein level. Cancer 2008;112:2188–94.  2008 American

infarction.1 Several mechanisms may contribute to the greater risk
for diabetes and cardiovascular disease during GnRH agonist therapy. GnRH agonists increase fat mass and decrease lean body
mass.2–4 GnRH agonists increase fasting plasma insulin levels5,6 and

related to insulin resistance.9,10 The National Cholesterol Education Program’s Adult Treatment Panel
(ATP III) and World Health Organization (WHO) have
defined the metabolic syndrome using distinct but
related criteria (Table 1).11,12 Other organizations
have presented similar but not identical definitions.
A recent cross-sectional study reported a higher
prevalence of the metabolic syndrome (as defined by
the National Cholesterol Education Program’s ATP
III) in 18 men receiving a GnRH agonist compared
with age-matched control groups of untreated men
with prostate cancer and men without prostate cancer.13 Although prospective studies have consistently
demonstrated that GnRH agonists increase fat mass,
decrease insulin sensitivity, and increase triglycerides, to our knowledge less is known regarding the
effects of GnRH agonists on other components of the
metabolic syndrome including waist circumference,
waist-to-hip ratio, and blood pressure. Similarly, little
is known concerning the effects of GnRH agonists on
other features of the metabolic syndrome including
characteristic alterations in fat distribution, adipocytokines, and markers of inflammation.
To better characterize the metabolic effects of
GnRH agonists in men with prostate cancer, we
prospectively evaluated changes in body composition, cross-sectional fat areas, and blood pressure
during androgen deprivation therapy with a GnRH
agonist. We also prospectively evaluated changes in
lipids, adipocytokines, and C-reactive protein. Our
results suggest that the term metabolic syndrome
neither adequately or accurately describes the metabolic effects of GnRH agonist in men with prostate
cancer.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Subjects
Subjects in these analyses were participants in a
previously reported randomized controlled trial to
compare the effects of leuprolide monotherapy with
bicalutamide monotherapy on bone mineral density
and body composition in men with recurrent or
locally advanced prostate cancer.14 We restricted the
current analyses to the 26 subjects assigned to leuprolide monotherapy because the intention of this
evaluation was to evaluate the metabolic effects of
standard androgen deprivation therapy with a GnRH
agonist. Except for changes in weight and percentage
fat mass from baseline to Month 12, none of these
prospective results has been reported previously.
Subjects with locally advanced or recurrent
prostate cancer were recruited between May 2000 and
May 2002. Men with bone metastases detected by
radionuclide bone scan were excluded. Men with a
Karnofsky performance status < 90, a history of hypogonadism, a history of growth hormone or anabolic
steroid use, Paget disease, hyperthyroidism, Cushing
disease, hyperprolactinemia, chronic liver disease, corrected serum calcium < 8.4 mg/dL or > 10.6 mg/dL, or
serum creatinine concentration > 2.0 mg/dL (177 lmol/
L) were also excluded. Men with prior neoadjuvant or
adjuvant hormone therapy were included if the interval
between completion of treatment and study entry
was > 1 year. Men were excluded if they had received
bisphosphonate, calcitonin, or glucocorticoid therapy, or
suppressive doses of thyroxine within 1 year.

Study Design
After the baseline visit, all 26 subjects received
leuprolide 3-month depot (Lupron Depot; TAP Pharmaceuticals, Deerfield, Ill) (at a dose of 22.5 mg intramuscularly every 3 months) for 12 months. Subjects
also received bicalutamide (Casodex; AstraZeneca,
London, UK) (50 mg by mouth daily) for 1 month
to prevent the potential disease flare associated
with the initial leuprolide administration. All subjects received calcium carbonate (500 mg daily), and
a daily multivitamin containing 400 IU of vitamin
D.
Subjects were evaluated at the Mallinckrodt
General Clinical Research Center at Massachusetts
General Hospital at baseline, 3 months, 6 months, 9
months, and 12 months. A serum sample was
obtained at each visit and stored at 2808C. Body
composition was measured by dual energy X-ray
absorptiometry at baseline, 6 months, and 12
months. Cross-sectional areas of the abdomen were
measured by quantitative computed tomography at

Board of the Harvard Cancer Center approved the
study. All subjects provided written informed consent. The study sponsors played no role in the study
design;, in the collection, analysis, and interpretation
of the data; or in writing of this report.

Outcomes
A research bionutritionist performed anthropomorphic
measurements. Fasting subjects were weighed wearing a hospital gown and no shoes. Body weight was
measured to the nearest 0.1 kg using a digital platform scale (Blue Bell BioMedical Model 500; SR
Instruments, Tonawanda, NY). Height was measured
to the nearest 0.1 cm using a wall-mounted stadiometer. Waist and hip circumference were also measured to the nearest 0.1 cm.
Lean mass and fat mass were determined by dual
energy X-ray absorptiometry with a Hologic QDR
4500A densitometer (Hologic, Waltham, Mass; software
version 11.2).
Cross-sectional areas of the abdomen, abdominal
subcutaneous fat, and intra-abdominal fat at the
level of the L4 vertebra were determined by quantitative computed tomography (GE Model I scanner;
General Electric Medical Systems, Milwaukee, Wis) as
described previously.3 Briefly, the total abdominal
area was determined from an outline of the torso
using image analysis software (General Electric
Advantage Windows Workstation, version 2.0). Two
contours were identified: the body perimeter and
deep fascia that delineates the back and abdominal
wall musculature. The abdominal subcutaneous
fat area was defined as the area between the 2 contours. Intra-abdominal fat was defined as the area
within the inner contour comprising all pixels with
attenuation coefficients between 250 and 2250
Hounsfield U.
Plasma adiponectin was measured using a quantitative sandwich enzyme immunoassay with a sensitivity of 0.246 ng/mL and intraassay and interassay
coefficients of variation of 2.5% to 4.7% and 5.8%
to 6.9%, respectively (R&D Systems, Minneapolis,
Minn). Resistin was measured using a quantitative
sandwich enzyme immunoassay with a sensitivity of
0.026 ng/mL and intraassay and interassay coefficients of variation of 3.8% to 5.3% and 7.8% to 9.2%,
respectively (R&D Systems). Serum cholesterol, lowdensity lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, high-density
lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, and trigylceride concentrations were measured by colorimetric enzymatic
assays on an automated clinical chemistry analyzer
with intra-assay and interassay coefficients of variation of 0.8% to 1.5% and 1.7% to 2.6%, respectively

Diagnostics, Exton, Pa).

Statistical Analyses
Changes in serum concentrations of lipids, adipocytokines, and C-reactive protein were evaluated using
repeated measures analysis of covariance.15 Longitudinal changes between baseline and 12-month values
for the other outcome measures were examined
using a 2-sided Student t test for paired data. Statistical analyses were performed using SAS statistical
software (version 8.1; SAS Institute, Cary, NC). Baseline values were reported as the mean  standard
deviation. Changes in outcomes were reported as the
mean  standard error. All P values were 2-sided and
values < .05 were considered statistically significant.

DISCUSSION
In this prospective study of men with locally
advanced or recurrent prostate cancer, androgen
deprivation therapy with leuprolide increased waist
circumference and tended to increase serum triglycerides, changes that are consistent with components
of the ATP III and/or WHO definitions of the metabolic syndrome. In contrast to the metabolic syndrome, however, leuprolide significantly increased
HDL cholesterol and did not significantly alter the
waist-to-hip ratio or blood pressure. Taken together,
these results suggest GnRH agonists result in a pattern of metabolic alterations that are distinct from
the metabolic syndrome.
Several other observations from the current
study also appear to distinguish the metabolic phenotype of GnRH agonist-treated men from the classic
metabolic syndrome. First, leuprolide preferentially
increased subcutaneous fat mass in our subjects,
whereas the visceral fat accumulation is more closely

associated with the metabolic syndrome.16 Second,
leuprolide was found to significantly increase adiponectin levels but cross-sectional studies have
reported that low adiponectin levels are associated
with features of the metabolic syndrome.17 Third,
leuprolide did not significantly alter C-reactive protein levels, whereas the metabolic syndrome is associated with elevation of C-reactive protein and other
markers of inflammation.18
Other prospective studies have reported that
GnRH agonists significantly increase fat mass2–4 and
increase fasting plasma insulin,5,6 a marker of insulin
resistance, in men with prostate cancer. Another
prospective study of nondiabetic men with prostate
cancer demonstrated that short-term treatment with
a GnRH agonist significantly decreased insulin sensitivity and increased glycated hemoglobin.7 Consistent with these results, a large population-based
study demonstrated that GnRH agonists are associated with a greater risk of incident diabetes in men
with prostate cancer.1 Thus, although GnRH agonists
are associated with obesity and insulin resistance,
central components of the metabolic syndrome, the
composite definition(s) of the metabolic syndrome
do not appear to effectively characterize the metabolic phenotype of men treated with a GnRH agonist.
The current study did not include testing for diabetes
and/or insulin sensitivity, although such additional
information would not alter our conclusions regarding the other features of the metabolic syndrome.
The observation that GnRH agonist treatment
increases adiponectin levels is in agreement with a
previous study of younger men without prostate cancer. In a prospective study of 28 healthy men ages 18
to 35 years, treatment with a GnRH agonist increased

Metabolic Changes in GnRH Therapy for Prostate CA/Smith et al.

serum adiponectin levels by 49% after 21 days.19 In
cross-sectional studies, low adiponectin levels have
been found to be associated with features of the
metabolic syndrome, including obesity, hypertension,
low HDL cholesterol levels, high triglyceride levels,
and insulin resistance.17 The correlation between
adiponectin and cardiovascular disease risk is controversial. Low adiponectin levels are associated with
prevalent cardiovascular disease.20–22 Some but not
all prospective studies of healthy individuals have
reported that higher adiponectin levels are associated
with a decreased risk of incident myocardial infarction in men and women.23–26 In contrast, a recent
prospective study reported that higher adiponectin
levels are associated with greater cardiovascular mortality in men.26 Further research is needed to evaluate the correlation between adiponectin levels and
cardiovascular outcomes in men receiving GnRH
agonists for the treatment of prostate cancer.
Similar to the estimated 74% prevalence of overweight and obesity reported in U.S. men aged 60
years,27 69% of our subjects had a baseline BMI >25
kg/m2. Consistent with the high prevalence of overweight and obesity, many of our subjects also
had > 1 components of the metabolic syndrome at
baseline. Although our subjects appear to be representative of the general population of older U.S.
men, somewhat different results might be observed
in prospective studies of men with a normal BMI.
Our study prospectively evaluated 26 subjects for 12
months. Larger studies with longer follow-up might
reveal small but statistically significant change(s) in
the waist-to-hip ratio, blood pressure, or C-reactive
protein levels that were not apparent in our prospective study. The observation that GnRH agonists significantly increase HDL cholesterol and adiponectin
levels and preferentially increase subcutaneous fat,
changes that are contrary to the metabolic syndrome, however, suggest that larger studies with longer follow-up are unlikely to alter our conclusion
that metabolic phenotype of men treated with GnRH
agonists is substantially different from the classic
metabolic syndrome. All subjects received bicalutamide for the first 4 weeks to block the potential flare
associated with initial GnRH agonist treatment and
this treatment may have contributed to the observed
metabolic changes. The current study did not have a
no-treatment control and some of the observed
changes may have also resulted from normal aging.
The practical use of the composite definition(s)
of the metabolic syndrome centers on its potential
value as a risk factor for cardiovascular disease. However, the metabolic syndrome is imprecisely defined
and appears to have limited independent value as a

2193

marker of cardiovascular disease risk.28,29 Given these
limitations and the distinct metabolic changes
described in the current prospective study, we
recommend that clinicians evaluate and treat individual cardiovascular disease risk factors without
regard for whether a prostate cancer survivor meets
the criteria for diagnosis of metabolic syndrome. In
addition, future research should focus on understanding the clinical implications of the distinct pattern of metabolic changes associated with GnRH
agonist therapy in prostate cancer survivors.
In summary, the classic metabolic syndrome is
characterized by visceral obesity, insulin resistance,
low HDL cholesterol, high triglycerides, elevated Creactive protein, and low adiponectin levels. In men
with prostate cancer, GnRH agonists increase fat
mass and waist circumference, decrease insulin sensitivity, and increase serum triglycerides. However, in
contrast to the metabolic syndrome, GnRH agonists
preferentially increase subcutaneous fat, increase
HDL cholesterol and adiponectin levels, and do not
change the waist-to-hip ratio, blood pressure, or Creactive protein levels. Additional research is necessary to better characterize the metabolic effects of
GnRH agonist treatment in men with prostate cancer
and to understand the implications for cardiovascular disease risk.
