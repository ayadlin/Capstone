ABSTRACT
In human cancers, miRNAs are important regulators of multiple cellular
processes, and aberrant miRNA expression has been observed, and their alterations
contribute to multiple cancer development and progression. Till now, little has been
known about the role of miR-204 in human glioblastoma (GBM). In the present
study, we used in-vitro assays to investigate the mechanisms of miR-204 in GBM
cell lines and 60 cases of GBM tissues. Here, we found that miR-204 expression is
downregulated in both GBM cell lines A172, U87 and U251 cells and GBM tissues as
compared with NHA cells and normal tissues (all p<0.001). In addition, the ectopic
expression of miR-204 suppressed A172 and U87 cell proliferation, migration and
invasion. Meanwhile, miR-204 over-expression extremely inhibited the protein
expression of ATF2. Notably, the enforced expression of ATF2 in A172 and U87 cells
with the over-expression of miR-204 attenuated the inhibitory effects of miR-204 on
proliferation, migration and invasion. In conclusion, our findings suggest that miR-204
suppressed cell proliferation, migration and invasion through inhibition of ATF2, thus,
miR-204 may function as a useful drug target in the treatment and diagnosis of GBM.

and translational levels [8-11]. The miRNAs are involved
in various cellular processes of cancer development,
including cell proliferation, differentiation, migration
and invasion [12-15]. Emerging evidence has identified
that the deregulation of miRNAs is related to initiation
of various cancers, such as bladder cancer, gastric cancer,
lung cancer, and breast cancer [16, 17]. Accumulating
studies showed that the deregulated expression of miR204 was observed in various cancers. For example, miR204 was reported to be significantly upregulated in most
pancreatic cancer [18]. Recently, miR-204 function as
a tumor suppressive miRNA and miR-204 expression
level is down-regulated in various human malignancies:
endometrial cancer [19], prostate cancer [20],
medulloblastomas [21], non-small cell lung carcinoma
[22, 23]. However, the expression and mechanism of miR204 in bladder cancer remain unclear.
In the present study, we investigated the potential
role of miR-204 in GBM cancer progression using invitro assays like RT-PCR and Western blot. We showed
that miR-204 is downregulated in clinically obtained

INTRODUCTION
Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is a grade IV
astrocytoma and the most lethal primary brain tumor
[1]. Astrocytomas are graded based on nuclear atypia,
mitosis, vascular endothelial proliferation and necrosis,
which define the diagnosis criteria of GBM [2]. GBM is
featured with a large degree of tumor heterogeneity and
easy invasion into surrounding tissues [3, 4]. The median
survival time for GBM is only 14.6 months with a 2-year
survival rate of 26%, although they have been remarkably
improved [5]. Although some potential drug targets have
been discovered, including transforming growth factor-β,
epidermal growth factor receptor, phosphatase and tensin
homolog etc, the lethality of GBM is not significantly
changed due to the efforts [6, 7]. Thus, there is still much
urgency for new and effective biomarkers to help find
more therapeutic targeted drugs.
The miRNAs are reported as a cluster of small, and
non-coding RNAs, and have the capacity of regulating
the expression of some genes at both the transcriptional

human GBM tissues. Moreover, we explored that miR204 plays a crucial role in cell proliferation, migration
and migration by directly targeting ATF2 in GBM cells.
Our data suggest a novel molecular mechanism of the
tumor suppressor activity of miR-204. Re-expressing
miR-204 and/or interfering with ATF2 function might be
a promising therapy strategy.

miR-204 overexpression resulted in significantly reduced
cell proliferation in both A172 and U87 cells (Figure 2b).
To figure out the role of miR-204 in GBM cell migration
and invasion, tranwell migration and invasion assay
was performed to assess the effects of miR-204 on the
migration and invasion capacity of A172 and U87 cells.
The tranwell assay revealed that miR-204 overexpression
repressed the migration and invasion capacity of A172 and
U87 cells compared with that of cells transfected with the
miR-NC control (Figure 3a, 3b).

RESULTS
miR-204 expression is reduced in GBM cell lines
and tissues

ATF2 is identified as a target of miR-204
A putative miR-204 binding site was detected at the
end of the ATF2 3’UTR according to previous reports.
Firstly, ATF2 expression was detected by real time PCR
and western blot in GBM cell lines (A172, U87, and
U251) and NHA cells. All GBM cell lines had higher
mRNA and protein expression of ATF2 than did the NHA
cells (Figure 4a, 4b). Accompanied by identification of
ATF2, the expression of MMP2 and MMP9 were also
detected, whose expression profile was consistent with
ATF2. In addition, in comparison with ATF2 mutationtype 3’UTR, the luciferase reporter activity was decreased
by approximately 40% in A172 cells or 45% in U87 cells
containing the ATF2 wild-type 3’UTR fragment (Figure
5a, 5b). Besides, we made a correlation analysis to
elucidate the negative association of miR-204 and ATF2
in A172, U87, and U251 cells.

miR-204 expression was detected by qRT-PCR in
GBM cell lines (A172, U87, and U251) and a normal
human brain cell NHA. All GBM cancer cell lines tested
had lower miR-204 levels than did the NHA cells (Figure
1a). Of 60 GBM samples, miR-204 was obviously downregulated compared with the adjacent normal tissues
(Figure 1b).

miR-204 inhibits GBM cancer cell proliferation,
migration and invasion
To figure out the role of miR-204 in GBM cell
proliferation, we generated miR-204-overexpressing
A172 and U87 cells by transiently transfecting cells with
miR-204 mimics. miR-204 expression was confirmed by
real time RT-PCR (Figure 2a). Our findings showed that

DISCUSSION

Enforced ATF2 attenuates the inhibitory effects
of miR-204

In this study, we examined both the regulation of
the ATF2 pathway by miR-204 in GBM, as well as its
functional significance. The miR-204 has been commonly
deregulated in various cancers. For example, miR-204 was
reported to be significantly upregulated in most pancreatic
cancer. Recently, miR-204 function as a tumor suppressive
miRNA, and miR-204 expression level is down-regulated
in endometrial cancer, prostate cancer, medulloblastomas,
non-small cell lung carcinoma. However, little is known
of its expression and potential function in GBM. Here, we
reported down-regulation of miR-204 and demonstrate its
role as a tumor suppressor in GBM. These finding also

To further elucidate the association between miR204 and ATF2, we conducted a transfection pcDNA3.1(+)ATF2 into miR-204-overexpressing A172 and U87 cells
to enhance the overexpression of ATF2 protein (Figure
6a). The CCK-8 proliferation assay showed that ATF2
overexpression enforced the proliferation potentials
of A172 and U87cells (Figure 6b). What is more, our
transwell assay also showed that ATF2 overexpression in
miR-204-overexpressing A172 and U87 cells enhanced
the migration and invasion capacity of A172 and U87 cells
in comparison with vector control (Figure 6c, 6d).

Figure 4: ATF2, MMP2 and MMP9 were up-regulated in GBM cell lines and NHA cells. The mRNA and protein level
of ATF2, MMP2 and MMP9 was measured in GBM cell lines using western blot. β-actin and GAPDH was used as an internal loading
control. The mRNA and protein expression level was calculated using Image J Pro software. Each bar represents the mean ± SD of three
independent experiments; *p<0.001, compared with NHA.

indicated that miR-204 is implicated in the development
of GBM.
Next, we further demonstrated that miR-204
inhibited ATF2 expression by targeting its 3'UTR,
indicating that ATF2 is indeed a direct target of miR204. Subsequently, we carried out western blot to testify
the overexpression of miR-204 could inhibit ATF2
protein expression. Some reports also identified ATF2
is a key signal molecule involved in cancer progression
and development [24, 25]. Here, we found that ATF2

overexpression reverses the inhibitory effects of overexpressed miR-204 on GBM cancer cell proliferation,
migration and invasion. Thus, the present data
demonstrates that miR-204 regulates ATF2 expression,
and thus over-expressed miR-204 functions as a tumor
suppressor in GBM progression.
Besides, we demonstrated that MMP2 and MMP9
were highly expressed in GBM cells, accompanied by
up-regulated ATF2 expression. According to reports,
MMPs act as a kind of calcium-dependent zinc-containing

invasion. a. Western blot analysis showed that transfecting the cells with ATF2 plasmids could up-regulate ATF2 expression. The
expression of ATF2 was normalized to that of β-actin. b. The proliferation capacity of miR-204-overexpressing A172 and U87 cells was
partially improved when cells were transfected with ATF2 plasmids in comparison with miR-NC. c, d. The migration and invasion of miR204-overexpressing A172 and U87 cells were effectively improved when cells were transfected with ATF2 plasmids. *p<0.001, vs. vector.

endopeptidases, and plays a crucial role in the remodeling
of organs and degradation of the matrix. Increase in matrix
metalloproteinases in different tumors and their correlation
with tumor invasiveness have been documented.
Meanwhile, ATF2 also has been reported to regulate the
tumor behaviors. Thus, it should be inferred that miR-204
affected proliferation, migration and invasion directly or
indirectly via inhibition of ATF2 to affect the expression
of MMP2 and MMP9.
In conclusion, our work demonstrates that miR-204
is frequently downregulated in patients with GBM, and
can be recommended as a potential tumor-suppressing
miRNA to inhibit GBM development and progression.
ATF2 regulated by miR-204 might also play an important
role in the regulation of malignant behavior of GBM.
Therefore our study provides a novel and promising
therapeutic target for GBM treatment.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Ethics statement

Western blot analysis

All of the patients provided written informed
consent. This study was approved by the Ethics Committee
of Fujian Medical University Affiliated Union Hospital,
and complied with the Declaration of Helsinki.

Total proteins were isolated from cells or tissues,
and protein concentrations were detected using the BCA
Assay Kit (Thermo Scientific). Protein samples were
separated by 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred onto
PVDF membranes (Millipore). The membranes were
blocked with 5% non-fat milk for two hours and then
incubated overnight at 4°C with the primary antibody,
including ATF2 (Cell Signaling Technology, 1:1000),
MMP2 (Cell Signaling Technology, 1:1000), MMP9
(Cell Signaling Technology, 1:1000) and β-actin (Santa
Cruz Biotechnology, 1:1000). Signals were detected
using the enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) luminol
reagent (PerkinElmer Inc.). β-actin was used as a loading
control.

GBM cell lines and tissues
Human glioblastoma cell lines A172, U251 and U87
were purchased from Cell Bank of the Chinese Academy
of Sciences (Shanghai, People’s Republic of China). All
these cells were cultured in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle’s
Medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum supplemented
with streptomycin (100 μg/mL) and penicillin (100 U/
mL). Primary GBM tissues and adjacent normal GBM
tissues (more than 3 cm away from the tumor) were
collected during surgery in Jinan Central Hospital. None
of the patients had received chemotherapy before surgical
resection.

miRNA mimic and inhibitor transfection

RNA isolation and quantitative RT-PCR

Functional consequences of aberrant miR-204
expression were studied by transiently transfecting miR204 mimic (Life technologies, Shanghai, China), and
corresponding negative controls miR-NC (GenePharma,
Shanghai, China) into cells. A172 and U87 cells were
seeded on a 24-well plate at 10,000 cells per well and
transfected 24 hours later with an miRNA mimics at
a final concentration of 10 nm using Lipofectamine
2000 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. At 48 hours after transfection,
A172 and U87 cells were harvested for western blot or
qRT-PCR analyses.

Total RNA was isolated from tissues and cell
lines using the miRNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen). The
miRNA Q-PCR Detection Kit (GeneCopoeia) was used
for quantification of miRNA levels according to the
manufacturer’s protocol. The protocol was conducted for
35 cycles at 95°C for 3 min, 95°C for 12 s, and 58°C for
30 s. The PCR amplification for the quantification of the
miR-204 and U6 was performed using TaqMan miRNA
Reverse Transcription Kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster
City, CA, USA) and TaqMan Human MiRNA Assay
Kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). The
following primers were used:

Luciferase reporter assay
The 3′-UTR sequence of ATF2 was amplified from
normal human genomic DNA and subcloned into the
pmirGLO luciferase reporter vector (Promega). Cells
(3.5 × 104) were seeded in triplicate in 24-well plates and
cotransfected with wild-type (wt) or mutant (mut) 3′-UTR
vectors and miR-204 mimics using Lipofectamine 2000.
After 48 h, A172 and U87 cells were assayed for luciferase
activity using the Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay System
(Promega) by following the manufacturer’s instructions.
The firefly luciferase activities were normalized to Renilla
luciferase activity. The firefly luciferase activity of the
cells that were transfected with miR-204 mimics or miRNC is represented as the percentage of activity relative to
that of cells that were transfected with negative controls.
All experiments were performed in triplicate.
