Abstract
In tumor-bearing hosts, myeloid-derived suppressor cells
(MDSC) and T regulatory cells (Treg) play important roles in
immune suppression, the reversal of which is vitally important
for the success of immune therapy. We have shown that ckit
ligand is required for MDSC accumulation and Treg development. We hypothesized that sunitinib malate, a receptor
tyrosine kinase inhibitor, could reverse MDSC-mediated
immune suppression and modulate the tumor microenvironment, thereby improving the efficacy of immune-based
therapies. Treatment with sunitinib decreased the number of
MDSC and Treg in advanced tumor-bearing animals. Furthermore, it not only reduced the suppressive function of MDSCs
but also prevented tumor-specific T-cell anergy and Treg
development. Interestingly, sunitinib treatment resulted in
reduced expression of interleukin (IL)-10, transforming
growth factor-B, and Foxp3 but enhanced expression of Th1
cytokine IFN-; and increased CTL responses in isolated
tumor-infiltrating leukocytes. A significantly higher percentage and infiltration of CD8 and CD4 cells was detected in
tumors of sunitinib-treated mice when compared with
control-treated mice. More importantly, the expression of
negative costimulatory molecules CTLA4 and PD-1 in both
CD4 and CD8 T cells, and PDL-1 expression on MDSC and
plasmacytoid dendritic cells, was also significantly decreased
by sunitinib treatment. Finally, sunitinib in combination with
our immune therapy protocol (IL-12 and 4-1BB activation)
significantly improves the long-term survival rate of large
tumor-bearing mice. These data suggest that sunitinib can be
used to reverse immune suppression and as a potentially
useful adjunct for enhancing the efficacy of immune-based
cancer therapy for advanced malignancies. [Cancer Res

Introduction
Immune therapies for cancer have been proposed and tested for
decades. However, these efforts have not translated into improved
overall long-term survival for advanced cancer patients. The
myeloid-derived suppressor cell (MDSC) is found to accumulate

in advanced tumor-bearing mice in organs such as the spleen, bone
marrow, and tumor itself as well as in the peripheral blood of
patients with various cancers, including breast, colon, pancreatic,
non–small cell lung, and head and neck cancers (1–3). These cells
are Gr-1+CD11b+ and are also CD115+. Our laboratory has previously
found that these MDSCs can induce CD4+CD25+Foxp3+ T regulatory
cell (Treg) in vitro and in vivo in murine cancer models (4, 5). MDSC
and Treg are both important in the establishment and promotion
of immune suppression. Several strategies have been devised to
prevent their function and decrease their accumulation (6–14).
Unfortunately, current strategies to effectively modulate MDSC (e.g.,
depletion, blockade of MDSC-secreted inhibitory factors, and
promotion of differentiation) and Treg function (e.g., depletion or
triggering of Toll-like receptor activation; ref. 15) are still under
investigation and may not control both MDSC and Treg immune
suppression function. Therefore, appropriate treatments to reverse
MDSC and Treg-mediated immune suppression to enhance the
efficacy of cancer immune therapies are necessary.
We have found that one of the candidate tumor-derived factors,
stem cell factor (SCF), is expressed by various human and murine
tumor cell lines. Mice bearing tumors with SCF small interfering
RNA knockdown had significantly reduced MDSC expansion and
restored proliferative responses of tumor-infiltrating T cells. In
addition, blockade of the SCF receptor (ckit) by anti-ckit
monoclonal antibody (mAb) prevented tumor-specific T-cell
anergy, Treg development, and tumor angiogenesis (5). Given this
role for ckit, we hypothesized that a clinically approved smallmolecule inhibitor of receptor tyrosine kinases that can interfere
with ckit signaling may have a novel role in reversing immune
suppression.
Sunitinib malate is an oral receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor
that inhibits some tumor growth. It is currently Food and Drug
Administration (FDA) approved for the treatment of gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST) that have failed conventional therapy
with imatinib mesylate and as the first-line treatment for
metastatic renal cell carcinoma (16–18). Sunitinib has shown
blocking effects on a variety of receptor tyrosine kinases, including
ckit, vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR2),
platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR), and Flt3 (19–21).
Sunitinib is well tolerated with acceptable toxicity and good
solubility, bioavailability, and protein-binding characteristics.
Because of the various targets of this multikinase inhibitor, we
tested whether sunitinib could decrease MDSC accumulation and
prevent T-cell suppression and whether sunitinib could be used
in combination with our existing Adv.mIL12 and 4-1BB ligand
(4-1BBL) immune therapy.
Furthermore, given the effect of sunitinib treatment on preventing MDSC accumulation and, therefore, Treg induction, we

tested whether treatment with the small molecule can alter the
tolerogenic tumor microenvironment and favor tumor-specific
T-cell activation.

Materials and Methods
Experimental mice and tumors. Congenic Thy-1.1+ BALB/c mice were
a gift from Dr. Richard Dutton (Trudeau Institute, Saranac Lake, NY), and
C57BL/6 and BALB/c mice were purchased from the National Cancer
Institute (Frederick, MD). Influenza hemagglutinin (HA)-specific I-Ed–
restricted CD4 T-cell receptor (TCR) transgenic mice (in BALB/c
background, Thy-1.2) were a gift from Dr. Constantin A. Bona (Mount
Sinai School of Medicine, New York, NY). OVA TCR transgenic (OT-II) mice
were purchased from The Jackson Laboratory. All animal experiments were
done in accordance with the animal guidelines of the Mount Sinai School
of Medicine.
Cell lines used were MCA26 (22) and LLC1 (Lewis lung carcinoma;
American Type Culture Collection). To establish a model in which tumor
antigen-specific T-cell responses can be tracked in vivo, an MCA26 line that
expresses influenza HA, HA-MCA26, was used as previously reported (4).
Peptide, antibodies, and immunostaining of tumor tissue. CD4 HA
peptide (110SFERFEIFPKE120) was purchased from Washington Biotechnology, Inc. OVA peptide (ISQAVHAAHAEINEAGR) was purchased from
AnaSpec, Inc. Mouse anti-Thy-1.2-biotin, mouse anti-Gr-1-allophycocyanin
(APC) or FITC, mouse anti-CD4 FITC, mouse anti-CD115-phycoerythrin
(PE) or APC, mouse anti-F4/80-FITC, mouse anti-CD11b-APC or FITC,
mouse anti-CD25-APC, mouse anti-Foxp3-PE, mouse anti-PD-1 APC, mouse
anti-PDL-1 PE, mouse anti-CTLA4 APC, mouse anti-CD19 PE, mouse antiPDCA-1 FITC, mouse anti-CD11c PE-Cy7, and isotype-matched mAbs were
purchased from eBioscience. Anti-ckit hybridoma (ACK2) was kindly
provided by Dr. Nakashima (Chubu University, Kasugai, Japan; ref. 23).
The full-length mouse 4-1BBL cDNA was obtained from pLXSHDm4-1BBL
(a generous gift from Dr. Lieping Chen, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN; ref. 24).
Recombinant adenoviral vectors, mouse model with liver metastases, and therapeutic protocol. The construction of Adv.mIL-12 has been
described previously (9). Metastatic colon cancer was induced as described
previously (25). At day 9 after tumor implantation, mice with liver tumors
that measured 8  8 to 12  12 mm2 were given 2.5  1010 viral particles
of Adv.mIL-12 or control DL312 (E1A-deleted control adenoviral vector)
intratumorally. The day following virus injection, mice were injected i.p.
with two 200 Ag doses of 4-1BBL, administered 3 d apart, followed by two
100 Ag doses of 4-1BBL 3 d apart. Sunitinib (0.015 mg/d) diluted in 300 AL
PBS or PBS alone was administered daily for a total of 4 wk.
Isolation of MDSC and tumor-infiltrating T cells. Mice with tumors
12  12 to 15  15 mm2 were sacrificed and the spleens, tibias, and femurs
were harvested. After lysis of RBCs, bone marrow cells and splenocytes were
fractionated on a Percoll (Amersham Biosciences) density gradient as
previously described (8, 26). Cells banding between 40% and 50% were
labeled as fraction 1, between 50% and 60% as fraction 2, and between 60%
and 70% as fraction 3.
Tumor-infiltrating leukocytes (TIL) were isolated from tumor tissues as
described previously (9). The purity of the sorted cells with >97% purity was
used in subsequent experiments.
Determination of total MDSC cell number. MCA26 tumor-bearing
mice with large tumors (7  7 to 10  10 mm2) were selected for treatment
with PBS or sunitinib (0.005, 0.010, or 0.015 mg/d) for 10 d. Splenocytes,
bone marrow cells, and TILs were harvested and stained with anti-Gr-1 and
anti-CD115 followed by flow cytometry. Absolute cell numbers were
determined by multiplying the percentage of Gr-1+CD115+ MDSC by the
total number of Percoll fraction 2 cells.
MDSC suppression assay. The suppressive activity of MDSC was
assessed in peptide-mediated proliferation assays of TCR transgenic T cells
as described previously (4). Briefly, splenocytes (1  105) from OT-II mice
were cultured in the presence of OVA peptides (1 Ag/mL) and serial
dilutions of irradiated (850 rad) MDSCs in 96-well microplates. [3H]thymidine was added during the last 8 h of 72-h culture.

Cytokine detection by ELISA. Cytokine concentrations in culture
supernatants were measured using mouse interleukin (IL)-10 ELISA kits
(R&D Systems) per manufacturer’s instructions.
Adoptive transfer experiments. HA-MCA26 cells (9  104; or neotransfected parental MCA26 cells as a control) were inoculated into Thy1.1+ BALB/c mice, and on day 8, the tumor size was confirmed to be 7  7
to 10  10 mm2. Thy-1.2+ congenic CD4 HA-specific TCR transgenic T cells
were enriched by MACS separation (Miltenyi Biotec) and adoptive
transferred via tail vein injection (5  106 cells per mouse) 9 d after tumor
implantation. Mice were sacrificed at day 10 after the adoptive transfer and
Thy-1.2+ T cells were recovered from spleen and lymph node cell sorting.
Proliferation assay. Sorted Thy-1.2+ or column-enriched T cells
(1  104) were cocultured with irradiated (2,500 rad) naive splenic cells
(4  103; as antigen-presenting cells) in the presence or absence of HA
peptide (5 Ag/mL) in 96-well microplates. [3H]thymidine was added during
the last 8 h of 72-h culture.
CTL assay. Thy-1+ T cells (effector cells) in tumors were purified, by
MACS (Miltenyi Biotec), from MCA26 tumor-bearing mice that had been
treated with PBS or sunitinib for 10 d and then incubated with MCA26
tumor cells (target cells) at 10:1, 5:1, and 2.5:1 ratios for 4 h. Supernatants
were collected from each well for measurement of lactate dehydrogenase
release (CytoTox 96 Non-Radioactive Cytotoxicity Assay kit, Promega).
Specific killing (%) was calculated as follows: % cytotoxicity = 100 
(experimental release
effector spontaneous release-target spontaneous
release)/(total target release target spontaneous release).
Reverse transcription-PCR and quantitative real-time PCR. Target
cells were homogenized in Trizol reagent (Invitrogen) and total RNA was
extracted. Reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) was used to determine
relative quantities of mRNA (One-Step RT-PCR kit, Qiagen) using 28 PCR
cycles. The intensity of each band was further analyzed by IQ Mac v1.2
software and quantitated using glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase
(GAPDH) as the internal control.
Primers were purchased from DNA Integrated Technologies and include
the following: internal control GAPDH, 5¶-GTGGAGATTGTTGCCATCAACG-3¶ (sense) and 5¶-CAGTGGATGCAGGGATGATGTTCTG-3¶ (antisense); Foxp3, 5¶-CAGCTGCCTACAGTGCCCCTAG-3¶ (sense) and 5¶-CATTTGCCAGCAGTGGGTAG-3¶ (antisense); CTLA4, 5¶-TTACTCTGCTCCCTGAGGACC-3¶ (sense) and 5¶-TTAAAGGTACCACTGCAGAAGG-3¶ (antisense);

PD-1, 5¶-TGCAGTTGAGCTGGCAATCAGG-3¶ (sense) and 5¶-TTTTGCCTTGGGGTGCAGGGA-3¶ (antisense); transforming growth factor-h (TGF-h),
5¶-TGCTACTGCAAGTCAGAGACG-3¶ (sense) and 5¶-AAGGTGTCTCAGTATACCACCAG-3¶ (antisense); IL-10, 5¶-CTCTTACTGACTGGCATGAG-3¶
(sense) and 5¶-CCTTGTAGACACCTTGGTCTTGGAG-3¶ (antisense); and
BAFF, 5¶-GTTTCACAGCGATGTCCTTG-3¶ (sense) and 5¶-CTTGTTCTGTTTCCTCTGGT-3¶ (antisense).
Statistical analysis. Statistical comparisons between groups were made
after presenting the data as means with SD and then applying the
Student’s t test. Survival data were analyzed using the log-rank test. For
samples with equal variance, the paired Student’s t test for equal variance
was used. For samples with unequal variance, the Wilcoxon signed rank
test was used for statistical analysis. P < 0.05 was considered to be
statistically significant.

Results
Dose-dependent decrease in the numbers of MDSC and Treg
in sunitinib-treated tumor-bearing mice. We tested whether
sunitinib, a clinically approved drug, could decrease MDSC
accumulation in MCA26 colon tumor-bearing BALB/c mice. On
day 10 after implantation, mice bearing hepatic metastatic colon
tumors (7  7 to 10  10 mm2) were treated with sunitinib daily
for 7 days at varying dosages. The maximum dose of 0.015 mg
was calculated to be the mouse equivalent of the 50 mg daily

human dose. Subsequently, the numbers of MDSC in various
tissues were assessed by flow cytometry. We found that the
absolute numbers of MDSC decreased in a dose-dependent fashion
in the spleen, bone marrow, and tumor (Fig. 1A). Because MDSC
can induce Treg development, we investigated whether sunitinib
treatment also affected the percentage of Treg in treated tumorbearing mice. The results indicate that although sunitinib
treatment did not change the overall percentage of CD4+CD25+
Foxp3+ Treg in the spleens of naive mice, it was able to significantly
decrease the percentage of CD4+CD25+Foxp3+ Treg in tumorbearing mice, from 11% to 5.07% (P < 0.014, paired t test; Fig. 1B).
These results indicate that sunitinib can decrease the number of
Gr-1+CD115+ MDSC and the percentage of Tregs in tumor-bearing
mice, suggesting that sunitinib may be able to modulate the
accumulation of MDSC and Treg.
Sunitinib can reduce the immune-suppressive activity of
MDSC from treated tumor-bearing mice. We further investigated whether sunitinib could functionally reverse MDSC-mediated
immune suppression. MDSCs were isolated from the spleens
of tumor-bearing mice with and without sunitinib treatment
(0.015 mg/d for 1 week). Percoll fraction 2 MDSCs were then
cocultured at varying ratios with OT-II (CD4 OVA TCR transgenic)
T cells in the presence of OVA. The MDSC from sunitinib-treated
mice exhibited significantly reduced suppressive activity compared
with MDSC from PBS-treated control tumor-bearing mice (Fig. 1C).

The effect of sunitinib on leukocyte infiltration and
expression of cytokines and costimulatory molecules in TILs.
To further understand the mechanisms underlying the reversion of
immune suppression mediated by sunitinib, we investigated
whether sunitinib treatment modulated the tumor microenvironment in treated mice. We isolated TILs from large tumor-bearing
mice (7  7 to 10  10 mm2 before the start of sunitinib treatment)
and screened for the expression of various cytokines and
costimulatory molecules, which have been implicated in tumormediated immune suppression, by RT-PCR. The results showed
that sunitinib treatment reduced the expression of IL-10, Foxp3,
PD-1, CTLA4, and BAFF (B lymphocyte-activating factor belonging
to tumor necrosis factor superfamily) but increased Th1 cytokine
(e.g., IFN-g) expression in isolated TILs (Fig. 2A, left). We then
investigated the effect of sunitinib treatment on CTL responses
against parental MCA26 tumors. T cells isolated from treated mice
were used in a direct ex vivo CTL assay. The T cells from sunitinibtreated mice exhibited stronger cytotoxic activity against MCA26
tumor cells when compared with PBS-treated mice (P = 0.009 at
E:T = 2.5:1, 22.90 F 0.19% versus 11.20 F 2.40%; P = 0.014 at E:T =

24.75 F 1.41% versus 5.90 F 3.67%; Fig. 2A, top right). IL-10
secretion by splenic T cells isolated from sunitinib-treated mice
was also significantly reduced to basal levels similar to those of
normal mice on stimulation by anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 (Fig. 2A,

Large (7  7 to 10  10 mm2) MCA26 tumor-bearing mice were treated with PBS or 0.015 mg/d sunitinib for 7 to 10 d. Left, mRNA was prepared from the isolated TILs
and RT-PCR analysis was done. Top right, T cells in the tumors of treated mice (three mice per group) were isolated and the cytotoxic activity against parental

bottom right). Real-time PCR was done to further quantitate gene
expression. This confirmed the previous results but also revealed
that sunitinib treatment led to a significant reduction in TGF-h
expression and an increase in IFN-g expression (Fig. 2B),
suggesting that sunitinib may modify the tumor microenvironment, resulting in a shift of cytokine and costimulatory molecule
expression profiles that may favor T-cell activation and Th1
responses.
Sunitinib can modulate the composition of immune cells
and the expression of costimulatory molecules in TIL. We
further identified and characterized the specific subsets of
leukocytes and costimulatory molecules expressed in the tumors
of sunitinib- or PBS-treated mice by flow cytometry. The
lymphocyte population in the tumor was gated and increased
from 9.64% in PBS-treated mice to 21.3% in sunitinib-treated mice
(Fig. 3A, top left). Among TILs, a reproducible increase in CD4+ and
CD8+ T cells ( from 11.7% to 13.2% and 6.78% to 15.6%, respectively;
Fig. 3A, bottom left) in the gated lymphocyte population was
observed. Furthermore, the total numbers of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells
in the tumor were also significantly increased (in average, 1.10 
105 in PBS-treated group to 1.59  105 in sunitinib-treated group
for CD4, P = 0.003, and 0.6  105 to 2.4  105 for CD8, P = 0.003;
Fig. 3B). A decrease in the percentage of pDC and MDSC ( from
34.8% to 22.5% and 53.9% to 39%, respectively) was also observed in
sunitinib-treated mice (Fig. 3A, top and bottom right). The average

www.aacrjournals.org

total numbers of MDSC and pDC in sunitinib-treated group were
reduced ( from 1.01  106 to 0.74  106, P = 0.013, for MDSC and
from 0.28  106 to 0.21  106, P = 0.017, for pDC; Fig. 3B).
Interestingly, the B-cell population was also decreased in sunitinibtreated mice from 0.22  106 to 0.19  106 (P = 0.059; data not
shown).
Importantly, sunitinib treatment also resulted in phenotypical
changes in the TILs. The expression of the negative costimulatory
molecules PD-1 and CTLA4 was significantly reduced after
sunitinib treatment (Fig. 3C). The mean fluorescence intensity
(MFI) of PD-1 was decreased from a mean of 1,176 to 704 (P = 0.02)
in Treg and from 267 to 170 (P = 0.027) in B cells. The CTLA4 was
also reduced from 334 to 238 (P = 0.015) in CD8 T cells and from
875 to 561.5 (P = 0.02) in Treg (Fig. 3C). Furthermore, PDL-1
expression was also significantly decreased by sunitinib treatment
(MFI of MDSC from 713 to 420, P = 0.025, and pDC from 1,191
to 577, P = 0.02; Fig. 3B). In addition, whereas there was a
significant decrease in MFI of PD-1 on Treg, that of CD8 and CD4
cells was not affected significantly. This indicates that sunitinib
treatment can modulate the composition of the immune cell
subsets and results in the down-regulation of negative costimulatory molecules at the tumor site.
Decreased Treg percentage and prevention of anergy
of tumor (HA)-specific T cells by blocking tyrosine kinase

tumor-specific T-cell anergy in a HA-MCA26 congenic tumorbearing model. The HA TCR transgenic T cells (Thy-1.2)
were adoptively transferred into HA-MCA26 tumor-bearing mice
(Thy-1.1) followed by treatment with sunitinib, anti-ckit, or PBS for
10 days. The average tumor weight from sunitinib-treated and
anti–ckit-treated mice was significantly decreased compared with
PBS controls (Fig. 4A). We further assessed the immune response of
those adoptively transferred T cells (Thy-1.2+) isolated from the
spleens of recipient Thy-1.1+ mouse. T cells from the PBS-treated
group had minimal proliferative response, whereas T cells from
non–tumor-bearing naive HA TCR transgenic mice had a significantly higher proliferative response. Thy-1.2+ T cells from both the
sunitinib and the anti–ckit–treated mice had significantly higher
proliferative responses compared with those from control PBStreated tumor-bearing mice (Fig. 4B). The percentage of transferred

Thy-1.2, CD4+CD25+Foxp3+ Tregs in the spleen was determined by
flow cytometry. Sunitinib treatment significantly decreased the
percentage of Tregs from 20.5% to 10.9% in the PBS controls
(combined reproducible experiments, P = 0.02), whereas a similar
decrease in Treg to 8.05% was observed in the anti-ckit antibody–
treated group (Fig. 4C). This suggests that sunitinib can prevent
tumor-specific T cells from becoming Treg in tumor-bearing hosts.
Because sunitinib malate can block not only the ckit receptor
but also VEGFR2, PDGFR, and Flt3, we further investigated
whether decreased MDSC in sunitinib-treated tumor-bearing mice
(7  7 to 10  10 mm2) was mediated by inhibition of ckitdependent signaling using a ckit mutant mouse strain (Wv/Wv).
After treatment of both wild-type and ckit mutant tumor-bearing
mice with sunitinib, we observed a significant decreases in the
populations of MDSC in the wild-type mice but not in the ckit

mutants (Fig. 5). The PBS-treated ckit mutants had lower numbers
of MDSCs, suggesting that ckit plays a role in the accumulation of
MDSC. In our prior publication, we have shown that monoclonal
anti-ckit blocking antibody can prevent MDSC accumulation (5).
Taken together, these results provide evidence that ckit is required
for MDSC accumulation and suggest that ckit may be the major
target of sunitinib.
Blocking tyrosine kinases with sunitinib can enhance
immunomodulatory therapies. To facilitate clinical translation
of this novel adjunct to immune-based therapies, we next
determined whether sunitinib could further enhance the therapeutic efficacy of our Adv.mIL-12 and 4-1BB immune activation
therapy. Mice with tumors ranging from 8  8 to 12  12 mm2
were randomly divided into various treatment groups. One day
after initiation of the immune modulatory therapy (intratumoral
IL-12 gene delivery by adenoviral vector + 4-1BB activation), mice
began treatment with 0.010 mg/d sunitinib for the first 7 days
followed by 0.015 mg/d for 21 days or PBS every day for 28 days
as a negative vehicle control. Long-term survival was followed. All
mice treated with control vector DL312 + control Ig were dead
within 30 days after tumor implantation. As shown in Fig. 6, the
long-term survival of mice treated with Adv.mIL-12 + 4-1BB
activation + sunitinib was significantly higher than Adv.mIL-12 +
4-1BB activation + PBS (P = 0.0177) or Adv.mIL12 + sunitinib (P <
0.0001). Adv.mIL-12 + 4-1BBL + PBS and 4-1BBL + sunitinib also
improved the long-term survival of treated mice when compared
with the control DL312 vector and PBS alone group. The results
indicate that sunitinib can be used to improve the therapeutic
efficacy of Adv.mIL12 + 4-1BB activation in an advanced tumor
setting in which immune-based therapy alone has previously been
shown to be significantly less efficacious. These in vivo results
suggest that sunitinib, an orally ingested FDA-approved receptor
tyrosine kinase inhibitor for renal cell cancer and GIST treatment,
may also be used in a novel way in the immune therapy realm as

www.aacrjournals.org

an adjunct to immune therapies to reverse the immune
suppression associated with advanced malignancies.

Discussion
Our proof-of-principle studies suggest a potential clinical
application for SCF/ckit blockade in the prevention of immune
suppression as a complement to existing immune-based cancer
therapies (5). Therefore, we sought to investigate the use of the
FDA-approved tyrosine kinase inhibitor, sunitinib, for translational
studies to determine its efficacy in our immune therapy protocol as
well as to investigate the role of tyrosine kinases in modulation of
tumor-associated immune suppression.
To our knowledge, this is the first study to show a significant
decrease in immune cells associated with suppression as well as an
increase in other immune cells, such as CD8+, CD4+ T cells in
tumor-bearing animals, providing evidence that sunitinib may be
efficacious when used in combination with various immune
therapeutic approaches. Our results suggest that sunitinib may
modulate the tumor microenvironment not only by decreasing
Treg and MDSC numbers in the tumor but also by down-regulating
cytokines, such as IL-10 and TGF-h, and important immune
suppressive costimulatory receptors, such as PD-1 and CTLA4
(Fig. 3C). In addition, sunitinib treatment can increase the
percentage of CD8+ T cells in our animal model and in the
peripheral blood of human patients while significantly decreasing
the percentage of MDSC, Treg, and pDC (data not shown). Although
the selectivity of sunitinib on MDSC could not be directly addressed
in our studies, we provided strong evidence that sunitinib did alter
the number of MDSC, suppressive activity of MDSC at a per-cell
level, immune profile, and tumor microenvironment. Our preliminary studies5 with a limited number of patient blood samples

Figure 5. MDSC in the tumor of wild-type or ckit
mutant (Wv/Wv) tumor-bearing mice with or without
sunitinib treatment. Large tumor-bearing mice were
treated with sunitinib or PBS for 10 d. The TILs were
then isolated and stained for Gr-1 and Ly-6C to identify
the MDSC. ckit Wv/Wv tumor-bearing mice had a lower
percentage of MDSC in the tumor when compared with
wild-type tumor-bearing mice. Sunitinib treatment did
not further decrease MDSC in the tumor, suggesting
that ckit is the direct target of sunitinib.

showed similar results, indicating that 1 week of sunitinib treatment
in metastatic cancer patients may substantially affect the composition of immune cells in the peripheral blood.
Although sunitinib is an inhibitor for multiple receptor kinases,
we have provided strong evidence that ckit may be directly
involved in the sunitinib-induced reduction of MDSC in the murine
model (Fig. 5). Our ongoing study using Flk2-deficient mice (27)
indicates that the FLK2 receptor does not play a critical role in the
effect of sunitinib in our tumor models.5 It is possible, however,
that the VEGFR2 inhibitory function of sunitinib can be synergistic
due to decreased blood vessel formation because MDSCs have been

implicated as having a direct role in tumor angiogenesis (28, 29)
and the regulation of VEGF bioavailability in tumors by the
expression of matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9; ref. 29). The
inhibitory effect of sunitinib on both VEGFR2 signaling and MDSC
accumulation may provide a possible double hit on tumor
angiogenesis.
Various strategies to modulate the suppressive functions of
MDSC in vivo have been investigated, including depletion of Gr-1+
cells with anti-Gr-1 antibody (7, 13). Treatment with monoclonal
anti-Gr-1 antibody led to decreased tumor growth in mice.
However, translation of this approach in humans may be difficult.

Immune Suppression, MDSCs, and Immune Therapy

Chemotherapeutic agents have also been considered, including
all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA), pyrimidine antimetabolite, and
gemcitabine (13, 14). Administration of a clinical dose to tumorbearing mice caused a selective elimination or reduction of MDSC
in the tumor (10, 14, 30, 31). However, ATRA has also been shown
to favor Treg development (32, 33). Other groups have attempted
to use a small-molecule approach, for example, the phosphodiesterase inhibitor sildenafil (34) or inhibitors for cyclooxygenase-2 or
MMP-9, to reduce the suppressive machinery or tumor-promoting
activity of the CD11b+Gr-1+ MDSCs (35–37). However, the additive
effects of those reagents in combination with an immune
therapeutic protocol and their effects on other critical immune
cell types need to be further evaluated.
In this report, we found that sunitinib decreased the number and
percentage of MDSC, Treg, and pDC (Figs. 1 and 2), thereby
abrogating tumor-associated suppression and working in a
synergistic manner with our immune therapy protocol in large
tumor-bearing mice. More importantly, when analyzing the
peripheral blood mononuclear cells from metastatic cancer
patients, we found significant differences in immune cell profiles
between samples collected before and after treatment with
sunitinib, suggesting an immune modulatory effect of sunitinib
in cancer patients.5 Recently, it has been shown that sunitinib
treatment promotes CD1c dendritic cell differentiation. However,
the effect of sunitinib on CD14+ myeloid suppressor cells in renal
cancer patients was not statistically significant after 4 weeks of
treatment (38). Finke and colleagues observed a significant
increase in Th1 response and diminished Th2 cytokine expression
after 4 weeks of sunitinib treatment. A decrease in the Treg
population was observed but not statistically significant in treated

renal cancer patients (39). In a recent report comparing two
tyrosine kinase inhibitors sorafenib and sunitinib, it was found that
sorafenib, but not sunitinib, exerted a negative effect on the ability
of dendritic cell to migrate and stimulate a T-cell response and
significantly reduced the induction of antigen-specific T cells (40).
Interestingly, the number of Treg was also reduced in the
peripheral blood of mice treated with sunitinib, consistent with
our results.
Our studies provide evidence in an in vivo animal model that
targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitors can be used in a novel
synergistic way to enhance the therapeutic efficacy of existing
immune-based therapies for metastatic cancer patients. Because
this patient group has few options that lead to prolonged survival,
our novel strategy to combat the immune suppression associated
with advanced metastatic tumors through the use of sunitinib
provides a new modality of more efficacious immune therapy
protocols.
