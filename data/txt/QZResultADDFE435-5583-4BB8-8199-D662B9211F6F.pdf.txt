ABSTRACT:
In the present report, we demonstrate that sub-lethal stress induced by
consecutive exposure to 0.25 µM arsenic (As3+) for six months can trigger
reprogramming of the human bronchial epithelial cell (BEAS-2B) to form cancer
stem cells (CSCs) without forced introduction of the stemness transcription factors.
These CSCs formed from As3+-induced sub-lethal stress featured with an increased
expression of the endogenous stemness genes, including Oct4, Sox2, Klf4, Myc, and
others that are associated with the pluripotency and self-renewal of the CSCs. Flow
cytometry analysis indicated that 90% of the CSC cells are CD61¯, whereas 100% of
the parental cells are CD61+. These CD61¯ CSCs are highly tumorigenic and metastatic
to the lung in xenotransplantation tests in NOD/SCID Il2rγ-/- mice. Additional tests
also revealed that the CD61¯ CSCs showed a significant decrease in the expression of
the genes important for DNA repair and oxidative phosphorylation. To determine the
clinical relevance of the above findings, we stratified human lung cancers based on
the level of CD61 protein and found that CD61low cancer correlates with poorer survival
of the patients. Such a correlation was also observed in human breast cancer and
ovarian cancer. Taken together, our findings suggest that in addition to the traditional
approaches of enforced introduction of the exogenous stemness circuit transcription
factors, sub-lethal stress induced by consecutive low dose As3+ is also able to convert
non-stem cells to the CSCs.

INTRODUCTION

West Bengal (India), and the southwestern regions of the
United States of America. Globally, more than 100 million
people are currently exposed to drinking water containing
As3+ that is above the maximum contamination level
of 10 ppb (0.13 μM, 10 μg/L) set by the World Health
Organization (WHO) [3].
The mechanisms of how As3+ exposure causes
human cancer have yet to be fully elucidated. Several
reports demonstrated that As3+ is a poor mutagen in classic
mutagenesis assays and indicated that the carcinogenic
effect of As3+ is most likely due to its ability to induce
oxidative stress responses that are linked to DNA
damage, protein degradation, and gene transcription
[2]. In addition, As3+ is able to induce the biogenesis of
microRNA-190 (miR-190) that is responsible for the
down-regulation of PHLPP. The down-regulation of
PHLPP leads to the sustained activation of Akt, a protein

Arsenic, especially the inorganic trivalent form
(As3+), has been classified as a group I human carcinogen
by the International Agency for Research on Cancer
(IARC), the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA),
and the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry
(ATSDR) [1]. Substantial evidence from epidemiologic
and experimental studies has clearly indicated that
long-term exposure to As3+, either from drinking water
contamination or air pollution, can cause cancers of the
skin, lung, liver, kidney, prostate, and bladder [2]. Despite
extensive studies and the implementation of new standards
to reduce the levels of As3+ exposure, environmental As3+
exposure is still a major concern of public health in many
areas of the world, such as areas in Bangladesh, China,
Chile, Argentina, Australia, Mexico, Taiwan, Vietnam,

kinase that is important for cell transformation and
tumorigenic angiogenesis [4]. Furthermore, other recent
studies showed that As3+ is able to activate a signaling
cascade from JNK and Stat3 to Akt-mediated EZH2
phosphorylation, which may be linked to the epigenetic
reprogramming of the genome and the malignant
transformation of cells [5]. Finally, As3+ had been shown
to be capable of converting normal stem cells into cancer
stem cells (CSCs) in several experimental settings [6, 7].
CSCs represent a small reservoir of tumor cells
that have the ability to self-renew and differentiate into
diverse cancer cell progeny that form the bulk of tumors
[8-10]. It is generally believed that CSCs are the major
contributors to the sustained growth, heterogeneity,
recurrence, metastasis, and therapeutic failure of
tumors [11]. Although the first evidence for CSCs was
documented in hematological malignancies, in which only
a small subset of cancer cells were capable of forming
new tumors when transplanted into immunodeficient mice
[12, 13], emerging evidence suggests that CSCs are also
responsible for the continued expansion of the malignant
cell population in solid tumors of the brain, breast, liver,
and prostate, among others. [14, 15]. The origin of CSCs
is currently a subject of extensive debate. It is becoming
evident that CSCs may be derived either from normal stem
cells or progenitor cells, which acquired the features of
malignant transformation in some types of cancer, or from
terminally differentiated cancer cells or normal cells due

to dedifferentiation in other types of tumors.
With most CSC studies focusing on the four
Yamanaka factors (Oct4, Sox2, Klf4, and c-Myc, hereafter
referred to as Myc), which are essential for the stemness
of embryonic stem cells (ESCs), stem cells (SCs), induced
pluripotent cells (iPSCs), and CSCs, the potential role of
extracellular stimuli, such as sub-lethal stress induced by
As3+, in CSC induction has been understudied, and its
relevance to cancer development has remained obscure.
In the present study, we demonstrate that As3+ is capable
of reprogramming bronchial epithelial cells into CD61¯
CSCs without enforced expression of the Yamanaka
factors. Furthermore, a consecutive low-dose As3+
treatment, which induced a sub-lethal stress of the cells,
induces a sustained activation of JNK, leading to elevated
expression of endogenous Myc, which may be critical for
epithelial cell reprogramming and CSC formation.

RESULTS
Sub-lethal stress induced by consecutive lowconcentration As3+ treatment triggers malignant

stress of the cells, for four to six months could induce
the transformation of the human bronchial epithelial cell
line BEAS-2B, as shown by the resistance of these cells
to As3+-induced cell death and anchorage-independent
growth in soft-agar [16]. Intriguingly, these transformed
cells also exhibited a reduced ability to generate reactive
oxygen species (ROS) in response to As3+. To expand
these previous observations, we detailed the changes in
morphology and tumorigenicity of these transformed cells.
Despite continued culturing and passaging of the cells for
several months, the parental cells that were cultured in
As3+-free medium showed typical morphological features
of epithelial cells, such as the cells were well-organized
in sheets of cuboidal cells that were closely attached
and exhibited an apico-basal polarity. In contrast, the
transformed cells induced by As3+ showed fibroblast-like
morphology with elongated, ramified and thin cell bodies
that resembled mesenchymal cells or mesenchymal stem
cells. Moreover, these transformed cells grew into multiple
layers and formed sphere-shaped foci and demonstrated
signs of loss of contact inhibition (data not shown). To
test whether these transformed cells were malignant and
tumorigenic in vivo in recipient mice, 1 × 106 parental and
transformed cells were separately inoculated into the nude
mice subcutaneously. Tumor formation could be detected
after as early as four days in all mice inoculated with the
transformed cells. After 17 days of injection, the average
diameter of tumors of the transformed cells rose to 1
cm. No single tumor was detected in the mice that were
inoculated with the parental cells after 17 days (Figures

1A and 1B). Collectively, these results suggest that the
transformed cells induced by the As3+-induced sub-lethal
stress are highly tumorigenic.

Transformed cells possess the characteristics of
CSCs
During the routine culture and passage of the
cells, we noted that many transformed cells generated
two distinct daughter cells with different sizes after
cytokinesis, which is indicative of the unequal distribution
of cellular components into two daughter cells due to
asymmetric division, a feature of the self-renewal of stem
cells or CSCs [17] (Figure 1C). Closer monitoring of
these unequally divided cells revealed that these cells are
the major sources of forming sphere-shaped cell clusters
(right panel, Figure 1C). To verify whether some of the
transformed cells were possibly CSCs that were able to
self-renew, we next transferred the parental cells and
transformed cells into ultralow-attachment six-well plates
containing tumorsphere formation medium. As depicted
in Figure 1D, the transformed cells remained viable and
formed tumorspheres after four to seven days of culture
in serum-free medium. Some of the transformed cells
formed giant spheres with a relatively smooth surface
(Figure 1D, right two panels). In contrast, no viable cells
or sphere-forming cells were observed among the parental
cells (left panel, Figure 1D). To further determine the
self-renewal capability of the sphere-forming cells, serial

tumorsphere passage assays were performed. We found
that the sphere-forming cells were enriched significantly
through serial passage (Figure 1E). To test for another
functional hallmark of self-renewal of the CSCs, we
conducted 3D tumorsphere assays by seeding the cells
in a Matrigel matrix to mimic the growth niche of CSCs.
Again, the transformed cells, but not the parental cells,
formed tumorspheres in this Matrigel matrix-based 3D
culture (Figures 1F and 1G).

The sphere-forming cells are tumorigenic in vivo
The transformed cells induced by As3+ were highly
tumorigenic in nude mice (Figures 1A and 1B). To
determine whether the sphere-forming cells mentioned
above were key contributors to the tumorigenicity of the
transformed cells, we injected 10,000 transformed cells
and sphere-forming cells into nude mice subcutaneously
and compared the tumor growth rates of the transformed
cells and the sphere-forming cells. The sphere-forming
cells formed tumors, but they were smaller than those
formed by the transformed cells (Figure 2A). Moreover,
the tumor formation by the sphere-forming cells
appeared to lag behind that of the transformed cells by
approximately one week. Following that lagging period, a
similar tumor growth rate was noted between the sphereforming cells and the transformed cells (Figure 2B). To
exclude the possibility that residual immunity, which

provides an unfavorable niche for CSC growth in nude
mice, might cause the delayed tumor occurrence of the
sphere-forming cells, we next inoculated the cells in
NOD/SCID Il2rγ-/- recipient mice. Again, the sphereforming cells formed smaller tumors than the transformed
cells after two weeks of inoculation (Figure 2C). We
speculated that this smaller tumor size and the delayed
tumor occurrence of the sphere-forming cells in both nude
mice and NOD/SCID mice might be a result of the resting
state of the sphere-forming cells because these cells were
cultured in a serum-free environment for one to two
weeks before they were injected. An additional possibility
is that this phenomenon was a reflection of the nature of
the CSCs, since relative to the bulk tumor cells, CSCs are
slower in cell cycle and proliferation. Indeed, when fewer
cells (500 or 100 cells) were injected and monitored for 35
to 45 days in NOD/SCID mice, a similar tumor incidence
rate was observed between the transformed cells and the
sphere-forming cells (Figure 2D). These results suggest
that the sphere-forming cells are the key transformed cells
in tumorigenesis.

stem cells (iPSCs) [18]. Furthermore, the state of the selfrenewal of CSCs is established by the core regulatory
circuitry of transcription factors for the pluripotency
of the ESCs [19, 20]. Accordingly, we determined
the mechanism underlying the key phenotypes, such
as sphere-forming and tumorigenicity in NOD/SCID
mice, of the transformed cells by comparing the global
transcription profiles of the transformed cells to those
of parental cells via microarray analysis. Unexpectedly,
we found that a majority of genes are downregulated
in the transformed cells (Figure 3A). We identified 227
genes that were upregulated and 2,369 genes that were
downregulated more than 5-fold in the transformed cells
compared to the parental cells. Gene ontology analyses
revealed that the population of upregulated genes was
enriched with genes associated with the stemness of stem
cells or CSCs (Figure 3B) and the Wnt signaling pathway,
whereas the downregulated genes were mostly associated
with the protein ubiquitination and DNA repair pathways,
such as DNA homologous recombination (HR), mismatch
repair, and nonhomologous DNA end joining (NHEJ)
(Figure 3B). Intriguingly, a group of genes important for
the mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS)
that linked to the generation of energy and ROS through
the tricarboxylic acid cycle on the respiration chain was
also highly down-regulated (Table 1). The expression of
some of the key genes was validated by quantitative realtime RT-PCR, which confirmed that, consistent with the
expression profiling by microarray analysis, genes such

Increasing evidence suggests that some aggressive

to embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and induce pluripotent

as Sox2, Klf4, PBX1, and Hoxd10 were upregulated,
whereas those critical for DNA repair, such as BRCA1,
BRCA2, MSH2, and RFC1, were downregulated in the
transformed cells (Figure 3C).
To further address the observation that the
transformed cells induced by As3+-induced sub-lethal
stress have the properties of CSCs, the protein levels
for the core regulatory circuitry of transcription factors
for self-renewal and pluripotency of the CSCs were
determined by Western blotting. In agreement with the
data from the microarray and PCR, we noted an increased
expression of Oct4, Sox2, Klf4, and Myc, the quartet
of transcription factors essential for the maintenance of
stemness of ESCs, iPSCs and CSCs, in the transformed
cells (Figure 3D). In addition, we also observed elevated
levels of TCF4, PBX1 and EBF3, which also contribute
to the function of ESCs or CSCs, in the transformed cells.
Nanog, another important transcription factor of the ESCs
or CSCs, is marginally increased in the transformed cells.

CD133, CD24, CD44, CD166, EpCAM (CD326),
CXCR4 (CD184), c-kit (CD117), and among others have
been identified as surface markers of CSCs isolated from
glioblastoma, breast cancer, pancreatic cancer, prostate
cancer, or hepatocellular carcinoma [15]. To investigate
potential CSC markers in the As3+-transformed cells, we
conducted fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS)
analysis for the expression of a panel of 15 stem/progenitor
cell markers for the transformed cells. Except for CD49f
and CD61, no other positive markers were detected
(Figures 4A and data not shown). When we compared the
expression of CD49f and CD61 between the parental cells
and the transformed cells, we found that approximately
90-99% of both the parental cells and transformed cells are
CD49f positive (data not shown). Thus, it is unlikely that
CD49f is a CSC marker in the transformed cells. There is
a significant difference in the percentage of CD61 positive
cells between the parental cells and the transformed cells.
Nearly 100% of the parental cells are CD61 positive
(CD61+). In contrast, only about 6-10% of the transformed
cells are CD61+ (Figure 4A), suggesting that more than
80% of the transformed cells are CD61― cells. It is
possible, thus, that these CD61― cells are potentially the
CSCs among the transformed cells. Examining the cell
morphology showed that the CD61+ cells in the population

The CSCs in the transformed cells are CD61―
A consensus on CSC surface markers has not
yet been reached. However, several markers, including

of the transformed cells exhibited a morphology typical
of epithelial cells, whereas the CD61¯ cells exhibited
features of mesenchymal-like cells (Figure 4B). Other
tests suggested that the CD61¯ cells are the cells capable
of forming tumor spheres (Figure 4C) and colonies in softagar (Figure 4D). As an additional measure to support the
hypothesis that the CD61¯ cells among the transformed
cells that were induced by consecutive low-concentration
As3+ treatments are CSCs, we evaluated the levels of
the key transcription factors and functional proteins that
are important for the stemness of CSCs. CD61¯ cells
expressed higher levels of Oct4, Sox2, Klf4, Myc, TCF4,
and PBX1 relative to the CD61+ cells or parental cells
(Figure 4E). Despite the fact that the CD61+ cells in this
experiment are isolated from the transformed cells through
FACS, these cells showed a similar expression pattern of
those selected markers to the non-transformed parental
cells.

an in vivo self-renewing capability.

CD61¯ CSCs are highly metastatic to the lung
CSCs are thought to be responsible for long-term
tumor growth and relapse. These cells have also been
viewed as the major source of metastasis of the tumors
from the original sites to distant organs. To determine
whether the CD61¯ CSCs are metastatic, we directly
introduced 50,000 CD61+ and CD61¯ cells into NOD/
SCID Il2rγ-/- mice by tail vein injection, respectively. The
mice receiving CD61¯ cells showed severe shortness of
breath 10 days after injection and had to be euthanized on
the 13th day after injection. The lungs of the mice injected
with CD61¯ cells were 3- to 4-fold larger than the lungs of
the mice injected with CD61+ cells (Figure 5C). Multiple
nodules of different sizes could be observed on surface
and interior lung tissues from the mice injected with
CD61¯ cells. Pathological and histological examinations
revealed a colonized growth of cancerous tissues within
the parenchyma of these lungs (Figure 5D). Ki67 staining
confirmed a high proliferation of the cancer cells in these
cancerous lesions (Figure 5E). No abnormality was
observed in the lungs from the mice injected with CD61+
cells. These data clearly suggested that the CD61¯ CSCs
are highly metastatic to the lung. Except lung metastasis,
no other metastatic signs were noted in the mice injected
with CD61¯ cells, possibly because of the short period of
observation.

The CD61¯ cell population is a prerequisite for
tumor initiation in vivo
To compare the tumorigenic capability of the
transformed cells with different CD61 statuses, a limited
dilution assay was performed. Initially, we injected
100,000 CD61+ and CD61― cells to the left and right
flanks of NOD/SCID Il2rγ/- mice, respectively. At 24 days
after injection, tumor volume was measured. The volume
of the CD61¯ cell-derived tumor was approximately 4to 5-fold larger than the tumor derived from the CD61+
cells (Figure 5A, left panel). To further confirm this
observation, we reduced the number of cells to 1,000 in
this assay and monitored tumor growth for 28 days. All
4 sites injected with CD61¯ cells developed a tumor. In
contrast, only 1 out of 4 sites injected with CD61+ cells
had a tumor, which had a much smaller size (Figure 5A,
middle panel). When 100 cells were inoculated at 55 days
after the injection, tumor mass was found only in the
injection sites of CD61― cells (Figure 5A, right panel).
No tumor was found in the injected sites of CD61+ cells
throughout the observation period.
One of the primary characteristics of CSCs is
the ability to self-renew in vivo, which allows them to
reconstitute tumors identical to the original tumor in
animals through serial xenotransplantations. To test the
self-renewal characteristic, the primary tumors from
the CD61¯ cells were dissociated to create single-cell
suspensions. One hundred CD61¯ cells that were isolated
by FACS from the tumors were serially transplanted to
secondary NOD/SCID Il2rγ/- mice. As indicated in Figure
5B, the CD61¯ cells from the parental xenografted tumors
were able to recapitulate the original CD61¯ cells and
form the second and third generations of the tumors,
indicating that the CD61¯ cells are truly CSCs that have

JNK-dependent Myc expression is central to the
As3+ sub-lethal stress-induced CSCs
Overwhelming evidence suggests that the
expression of Oct4, Sox2, Klf4, and Myc is the key for the
maintenance of ESCs, adult stem cells and CSCs. Enforced
overexpression of these quartet factors has been shown
to be sufficient to reprogram differentiated somatic cells
into iPSCs. We were interested in how sub-lethal stress
induced by consecutive low concentration As3+ treatments
of the cells triggers the formation of CSCs without the
introduction of any of the exogenous quartet factors.
For our initial studies, we focused on the possibility that
As3+ activates Oct4, Sox2, Klf4, and Myc, which are the
essential transcription factors for reprogramming, selfrenewal and pluripotency. To test this hypothesis, we
treated the parental cells, among which approximately
99% of the cells are CD61+, and the transformed cells,
among which approximately 90% of the cells are CD61¯,
with various concentrations of As3+ for 6 h. Analogous
to our earlier experiments indicated in Figures 3 and 4,
under basal conditions, increased expression of the quartet
factors can be observed in the transformed cells (Figure
6A). In the dose-dependence study, only Myc can be

induced by As3+ in both parental cells and the transformed
cells. No conclusive effect of As3+ on Oct4, Sox2 and Klf4
was observed in either parental cells or the transformed
cells (Figure 6A).
Our previous reports showed that As3+ is a potent
activator of JNK [21, 22], a protein kinase that has
been linked to Myc expression [23]. To mimic the cell
transformation procedure in which the cells were in
sub-lethal stress condition induced by constitutive lowconcentration As3+ treatment, we treated the cells with
0.25 to 2 µM As3+ for 72 h and then measured JNK
activation along with Myc expression. As shown in
Figure 6B, the activation of JNK by As3+ is correlated
with Myc expression. The role of JNK on As3+-induced
Myc expression was further confirmed by inhibition of
JNK activity through either JNK inhibitor or siRNAs
specifically targeting JNK1 or JNK2. As shown in Figure
6C, JNK inhibitor, SP600125, attenuated the level of Myc
protein significantly in the cells treated with As3+ (Figure
6C). In addition, As3+-induced Myc expression was
reduced in the cells where JNK1 or JNK2 was silenced by
siRNAs (Figure 6D).

are CD61low, although the statistical significance, p =
0.0095 is not as strong as that of the breast cancer patients
(Figure 7D). Together, these data clearly indicate that a
subset of human cancers have CD61low status that serves
as an important predictor of survival for patients with lung
cancer, breast cancer, and ovarian cancer.

DISCUSSION
By consecutive treatments of the human bronchial
epithelial cells with low concentrations of As3+ for six
months, which induced a sub-lethal stress of the cells, we
revealed reprogramming of these cells to form CD61¯
CSCs without the enforced expression of the exogenous
transcription factors essential for self-renewal and
pluripotency. In addition to the higher tumorigenicity and
metastasis as evident in studies of limited dilution, serial
xenotransplantation and intravenous injection of the cells
in NOD/SCID Il2rγ-/- recipient mice, we also demonstrated
that CD61 status is a prognostic factor for predicting the
overall survival of the lung cancer patients as well as the
patients with breast cancer or ovarian cancer. Furthermore,
our approaches of gene expression profiling and ontology
assays delineate some important and new features of the
CD61¯ CSCs, most notably, is the decreased expression of
genes that are prominent in several DNA repair pathways
and oxidative phosphorylation (Fig. 3 and Table 1).
As3+ is a well-known environmental human
carcinogen that is able to activate a number of intracellular
protein kinases and transcription factors that are involved
in cell growth, cell cycle, pro- or anti-apoptosis, and
malignant transformation [4, 5]. The current standard
of As3+ in drinking water established by both the World
Health Organization (WHO) and the Environmental
Protection Agency (EPA) of the United States of
American is less than 10 ppb (0.13 µM). However, more
than one hundred million people worldwide are still at
risk for exposure to drinking water with levels of As3+
exceeding 100 to 1,000 ppb (1.3 - 13 µM) [3]. A number
of epidemiology and case-control studies demonstrated a
strong association of environmental As3+ exposure, either
through drinking water contamination or air pollution,
to the increased incidence rate of human lung cancer
[25]. By analyzing As3+ levels in soils and the data of
cancer registries and statistics, recent studies by Putila
and Guo revealed a correlation between the sediment
levels of As3+ and human lung cancer, and concluded
that soil As3+ contributes to more then 5,000 lung cancer
cases annually in the US [26]. Mechanistically, As3+
was believed to be able to activate several oncogenic
intracellular signaling pathways that mediate malignant
transformation or carcinogenesis of the normal cells
induced by As3+ [27, 28]. It remains to be fully elucidated,
however, whether CSCs are involved in the As3+-induced
lung carcinogenesis.
The capability of As3+ in inducing CSCs was first

CD61low lung cancer correlates with the poorer
survival of the patients after tumor resection
The fact that CD61¯ cells have the characteristics
of CSCs, are highly tumorigenic and are metastatic to
the lung raised the possibility that CD61 status might
be important in the prognosis of patients with lung
cancer and other cancers. To explore whether there is a
correlation between the CD61 status and patient survival,
we performed an immunohistochemical analysis on panels
of a tissue microarray containing 100 archived human lung
cancer samples of different stages and histological types
using a CD61 antibody. Based on the strength of CD61
staining, we arbitrarily stratified human lung cancers into
a CD61 high group (CD61high) and a CD61 low group
(CD61low) (Figure 7A). We found no significant correlation
between CD61high or CD61low and lung cancer types or
stages (data not shown). However, as shown in Figure 7B,
the status of CD61 is a strong predictor of patient survival.
The CD61low was associated with shorter survival time of
the patient after tumor resection (p = 0.019 based on logrank test for trend). To gain additional insights into the
prognostic value of CD61, we also searched the KaplanMeier plotter database (www.kmplot.com) [24], focusing
on the CD61 gene expression level and the relapse-free
survival of breast cancer and overall survival of ovarian
cancer patients. Among the available data for total of
2,878 breast cancer patients, a lower expression of CD61
(1,479 patients) is a strong predictor of poorer relapsefree survival with a p-value of 8.3e-08 (Figure 7C). The
same conclusion was reached for the overall survival of
1,435 ovarian cancer patients, among which 718 patients

Some earlier studies suggested that stem cells
or CSCs are incapable of using OXPHOS for energy
metabolism due to poor development of the mitochondria
or decoupling of the respiratory chain in mitochondria
[36]. This notion can be supported by the observed
down-regulation of the genes in OXPHOS in the As3+induced CD61¯ CSCs in the present report (Table 1).
Under physiological conditions, cells use OXPHOS in
mitochondria for complete oxidation of glucose to generate
ATP as well as ROS. In OXPHOS, glucose is metabolized
to pyruvate that is channeled to tricarboxylic acid (TCA)
cycle for the maximal ATP production. However, stem
cells or CSCs are mostly resided in a hypoxic niche that
favors glucose metabolism through aerobic glycolysis
(also known as Warburg effect) to generate lactate in
cytoplasm. Thus, decrease of ROS in a given population
of cells is indicative of repressed OXPHOS and enhanced
glycolysis. The glycolysis and OXPHOS of the glucose
homeostasis are reciprocally regulated. For example, the
ROS generated from OXPHOS can inactivate the key
glycolysis enzymes, whereas NADPH generated from the
pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) of the glycolysis is a
powerful antioxidant against ROS. It is well-known that
ROS are potent inducers of tumor suppressor p53 that can
inhibit the activities of the stemness genes, such as Oct4,
c-myc, Sox2, Klf4, and Nanog [37]. In addition, higher
level of ROS may directly oxidize and inactivate these
stemness transcription factors. Furthermore, ROS are
highly capable of inducing DNA damage, differentiation
and apoptosis of the CSCs. Thus, low concentration of
ROS is critical for self renewal of CSCs by reducing
the sensitivity of CSCs to oxidative stress-induced
DNA damage and apoptosis. Many reports indicated
that the pluripotent status of stem cells or CSCs rely on
glycolysis [38, 39]. Several oncogenic growth signals,
such as, Hedgehog, STAT3, Akt, and c-Myc, can promote
glycolysis by inducing expression or activity of the ratelimiting enzymes in the glycolysis pathway that primes or
supports the stemness status induced by Oct4, Myc, Sox2,
and Klf4 [40, 41].
A number of studies indicate that there is a
hierarchical organization of tumor cells, in which
CSCs are at the apex and responsible for generating
differentiated progeny to repopulate cancer cells with high
heterogeneity [15]. Despite this, whether all cancers are
driven by CSCs is still a topic of intensive debate. A major
hurdle currently facing in CSC studies is the inconsistence
of CSC surface markers among several different types
of cancers. Although some surface markers, including
CD133, CD24, CD34, CD44, CD166, and EpCAM, have
proven to be useful for the isolation of subsets enriched
for CSCs in multiple types of tumors [14], a considerable
number of reports failed to detect these markers on certain
subpopulations of CSCs. Consistent with this notion, we
were also unable to detect these tentative markers on
the As3+-induced CSCs. However, we defined a specific

implicated in studies using in utero As3+ exposure in mice
by Waalkes and colleagues [29, 30], which showed that
fetal exposure to As3+ enhanced the susceptibility and
aggressiveness of skin tumors with an increased number of
CD34+ cells, the tentative CSCs. It was speculated that this
enhancement in skin carcinogenesis was resulted from the
effects of As3+ on embryonic stem cells and/or keratinocyte
stem cells. This assumption was compensatorily confirmed
by the fact that As3+ could convert non-transformed
prostate epithelial stem/progenitor cells and renal stem
cells into the CSCs [6, 7, 31, 32]. An additional evidence
to support this notion is from “whole-life” As3+ exposure,
which showed that parental exposure to As3+ prior to
breeding, during pregnancy and lactation increased tumor
formations in the offsprings [33]. A unique feature of these
tumors in offsprings, esp., for the lung adenocarcinoma
and hepatocellular carcinomas, is the overabundance of
the CSCs in these tumors.
The present report showed that As3+ can reprogram
non-stem cells into the CSCs. The compelling question
to be asked is how As3+, without assistance from the
overexpression of any of the required transcription factors,
activates a reprogramming process from a program that
normally promotes differentiation. Our biochemical data
indicated that As3+ appears to be unable to regulate Oct4,
Sox2 and Klf4 in both parental cells and the transformed
cells (Figure 6A), despite an increased expression of
Oct4, Sox2 and Klf4 in the transformed cells induced by
As3+. However, As3+ is highly capable of inducing Myc
expression in the parental cells as well as the transformed
cells (Figure 6A). Disruption of the JNK signaling by
either JNK inhibitor SP600125 or JNK specific siRNAs
prevented Myc induction by As3+ (Figures 6C and 6D).
Thus, it is very likely that sustained Myc induction by
As3+ sub-lethal stress plays central role in the formation
of CSCs.
Although the CSCs induced by As3+ showed
increased expression of the genes important for the
pluripotent and self-renewal of the CSCs, it is unexpected
that the expression of the majority of the genes is downregulated. Among these down-regulated genes, the most
important groups of genes are those involved in DNA
repair and OXPHOS (Fig. 3 and Table 1). At the present,
the DNA damage responses and repair capability in stem
cells or CSCs are poorly characterized. The finding of
massive down-regulation of the DNA repair genes may
implicate the nature of genomic instability of the CSCs. In
human breast epithelial cells and breast CSCs, it was found
that increased expression or activity of the EZH2 protein,
a key subunit of the Polycomb Repression Complex 2
(PRC2) that induces trimethylation of the lysine 27 on
histone H3, repressed most of the Rad51 paralog proteins
important for DNA HR repair [34, 35]. This is possibly
true for the As3+-induced CD61¯ CSCs, because an
increased expression of EZH2 protein was noted in these
cells (Chang et al, unpublished observation).

CD61¯ CSC population based on the expression of the
stem cell transcription factors, mesenchymal morphology,
tumorigenicity, and metastasis to the lung in NOD/SCID
Il2rγ-/- mice (Figures 4-5). CD61 has been previously
identified as a bona fide marker for the enrichment of
CSCs from HER2-induced breast cancer in mice [42]. A
heterogeneous expression of CD61 among a number of
human breast cancer cell lines has been recently reported
[43]. In the present study, we found that nearly 100% of
the parental cells and 6% of the transformed cells are
CD61+. Several tests clearly indicated that the CD61+ cells
are neither tumorigenic nor CSCs. In contrast, the CD61¯
cells possess CSC features in vitro and in vivo.
As3+ is one of the major non-tobacco carcinogens
associated with lung cancer of never smokers [44]. The
findings from the present study provide novel mechanistic
insights into lung carcinogenesis due to environmental
exposure to As3+ or other carcinogens. It has been widely
believed that an enforced introduction of the exogenous
quartet of transcription factors, including Oct4, Sox2,
Klf4, and Myc, is essential for the establishment of
iPSCs or CSCs from somatic cells. Most recent studies,
however, also revealed that mildly acidic conditions can
induce iPSCs from somatic cells, indicating that some
sub-lethal stimuli may able to trigger reprogramming
without assistance from the overexpression of any of the
required transcription factors [45, 46]. Our findings that
sub-lethal stress induced by consecutive low concentration
of As3+ treatment induces CD61¯ CSCs provided the
first evidence to support such notion. It is unclear, at the
present, whether the same mechanisms are involved in the
reprogramming of the cells in response to mildly acidic
conditions and As3+-induced sub-lethal stress. Additional
biochemical tests in our studies revealed that As3+ is
unable to regulate Oct4, Sox2 and Klf4 in both parental
cells and the CSC-like cells or the CD61¯ CSCs (Figure
6A), despite an increased expression of Oct4, Sox2 and
Klf4 in the latter cells induced by As3+. However, sublethal stress induced by As3+ is highly capable of inducing
Myc protein in the parental cells as well as CD61¯ CSCs
(Figure 6B). Thus, it is very likely that sustained Myc
induction by As3+-induced sub-lethal stress plays a central
role in the formation of CSCs. It is worth to test whether
this is true in other sub-lethal stress-induced generation of
the iPSCs or CSCs.

cells were treated with 0.25 µM NaAsO2 continuously
for six months. Cells cultured without As3+ treatment
for six months were used as parental cell control in all
experiments. Cell transformation was evaluated by
using in vitro soft agar colony-forming assay and in vivo
tumorigenicity experiment in athymic nude mice. For the
soft agar colony-forming assay, 1% agar was melted and
mixed with 2 × DMEM medium in a 1:1 ratio to produce
a supporting layer (0.5%) in a 6-well tissue culture plate
(1 ml/well). The bottom agar layer was allowed to solidify
at room temperature for 20 min. The top layer containing
0.3% agar (1 ml/well) was prepared by mixing stock agar
solutions with 5,000 cells in 2× DMEM medium and was
laid on the top of the bottom agar layer. Fresh DMEM
medium was added every 3 days. Three weeks later,
colonies were stained with a 0.05% crystal violet solution,
counted, and photographed under a microscope.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

The self-renewal capability of the transformed
cells was determined by an in vitro tumor sphere
formation assays. Briefly, 5,000 cells were seeded onto
ultralow-attachment 6-well plates (Corning life sciences,
Tewksbury MA) in serum-free DMEM/F12 (Invitrogen,
Grand Island, NY) medium containing 1× B27 supplement
(Invitrogen), 20 ng/ml EGF (Invitrogen) and 20 ng/
ml bFGF (Invitrogen). Fresh medium was added every
three days for two weeks. Tumor spheres were counted
and photographed using a microscope. For tumor sphere

Clonal formation assay
For holoclone assays, parental or transformed cells
were plated at a clonal density of 10 cells/well in 6-well
plate in DMEM medium with 10% FBS. Seven days later,
the holoclone numbers were counted using a microscope.

Flow cytometry analysis and fluorescenceactivated cell sorting (FACS)
The cells were dissociated, and one million
individual cells were resuspended in 100 µl of sorting
buffer (PBS containing 0.5% FBS, 2 mM EDTA) and then
stained with 20 µl of the indicated antibodies conjugated
with PE or FITC purchased from BD Biosciences (San
Jose, CA) for 30 min at 4°C. Antibodies against human
immunoglobulin conjugated to PE or FITC (BD) were
used as antibody isotype controls. The cells were washed
in PBS and centrifuged at 800×g for 2 min twice and then
resuspended in 500 µl sorting buffer. FACS analysis was
performed using CellQuest software (BD Biosciences).
The cells were sorted on the FACS Vantage SE/SORP with
a Diva flow cytometer (BD Biosciences).

In vitro Tumor sphere formation

passage assays, the primary spheres were dissociated
and reseeded in ultralow-attachment 6-well plates for the
second round of tumor sphere formation. All experiments
were performed in triplicate for each condition and were
repeated at least three times.

For the evaluation of tumorigenicity, 1 × 106 parental
or transformed cells were injected subcutaneously into the
flank of 6-week-old male BALB/c nude mice purchased
from the Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME). Tumor
size was measured on the indicated days with calipers, and
tumor volume was calculated based on the formula (width2
× length)/2. All animal procedures were preapproved
by the Institutional Animal and Care Use Committee
(IACUC) of the Wayne State University.

Western blot analysis
Cells were lysed in 1× RIPA lysis buffer containing
protease and phosphatase inhibitors on ice. Each sample,
containing 40 µg of protein, was resolved on a 4-12%
Bis-Tris Gel with MOPs Running Buffer and transferred
to PVDF membranes. The blots were then probed with
various antibodies. Horseradish peroxidase (HRP)conjugated secondary antibodies were used to detect the
specific immunoreactions. Blots were developed with an
enhanced chemiluminescence regent (Pierce) and exposed
to X-ray film. The following primary antibodies were
used: Oct4, Sox2, Klf4, c-Myc, Nanog, TCF4, PBX1,
EBF3, CD44, CD49f, E-Cad, KRT5, Fibronectin, p63,
Vimentin, β-catenin, EZH2, pEZH2, JNK, pJNK, Stat3,
pStat3, Akt, pAkt, Smad3, pSmad3s208, Actin, and GAPDH.
All antibodies were purchased from Cell Signaling
Technology (Danvers, MA), Abcam (Cambridge, MA), or
Santa Cruz Biotechnology, INC. (Santa Cruz, CA).

Transplantation assays using CSCs in NOD/SCID
Il2r-/- mice
To evaluate the tumorigenicity of the putative CSCs,
aliquots of 100 or 500 parental cells, transformed cells,
CD61+ cells, or CD61¯ cells were injected subcutaneously
into the flank of 6-week-old male NOD/SCID Il2r-/- mice
purchased from Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME).
The mice were euthanized on the indicated days, followed
by the removal of tumors. Tumor size was measured by
volume, as calculated based on (width2 × length)/2, or by
direct weighting. For the serial xenotransplantation of the
CSCs, the primary tumors or the secondary tumors that
were removed from NOD/SCID mice were dissociated
mechanically and enzymatically to generate single cell
suspensions for a subsequent injection into the new NOD/
SCID mice.

Gene expression profiling and real-time PCR
Total RNA was extracted from 1×107 parental cells,
As -induced transformed cells and tumor sphere-forming
cells using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) and dissolved in
diethyl pyrocarbonate-treated H2O to a final concentration
of 500 ng/µl. RNA integrity was determined by
electrophoresis. Gene expression profiling was performed
using the Human Gene 1.0 ST Array (Affymetrix). To
identify differentially expressed genes between the
parental cells, transformed cells and tumor sphereforming cells, data were uploaded to Partek® software
(version 6.6 Copyright © 2012 Partek Inc., St. Louis, MO)
using the Exon workflow. Quantile normalization, log2transformation, probeset summarization (median polish),
and background subtraction (RMA) were performed on
the data upon import. Exons were summarized to genes by
averaging exon expression across each gene. Differential
expression was calculated for each comparison by
performing an analysis of variance (ANOVA). Genes
with a change of at least ± 1.5-fold and an FDR-corrected
p-value < 0.05 are reported. Hierarchical clustering
(Euclidean Distance and Average linkage clustering) was
performed using the TM4 Microarray Software Suite’s
MultiExperiment Viewer V4.8. The gene expression
profiling data were validated by quantitative real-time
PCR, as reported previously.
