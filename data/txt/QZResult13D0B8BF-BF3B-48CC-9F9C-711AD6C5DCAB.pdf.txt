Abstract
Elucidating how cancer cells respond to antagonists of HER receptor family members is critical to understanding mechanisms of therapeutic resistance that arise in patients. In large part, resistance to such agents
appears to arise from deregulation of the phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt/mTOR pathway. mTORdependent phosphorylation of the translation repressor 4E-BP1 leads to its dissociation from eIF4E, thereby
causing an increase in the formation of the eIF4F complex, which also comprises eIF4G and eIF4A. In this study,
we show that trastuzumab, cetuximab, and erlotinib all decrease the formation of the eIF4F complex in breast,
colon, and head and neck cancer cells, respectively. Ectopic expression of eIF4E restores the trastuzumabdependent defect in eIF4F formation, renders cells resistant to the trastuzumab-mediated decrease in cell
proliferation, and rescues breast cancer xenografts from inhibition by trastuzumab. In breast tumor specimens, the
level of eIF4E expression is associated with the therapeutic response to a trastuzumab-based regimen. Together,
our findings suggest that formation of the eIF4F complex may be a critical determinant of the response to anticancer drugs that target HER2 and epidermal growth factor receptor. Cancer Res; 71(12); 4068–73. 2011 AACR.

Introduction
Targeting the members of the HER tyrosine kinase growth
factor receptor family, which have been implicated in the
development of many human cancers, has been intensely
pursued as a major therapeutic strategy in cancer. Specifically,
trastuzumab (Herceptin, Genentech), a Food and Drug Administration–approved, humanized, anti-HER2 monoclonal antibody that has become the standard of care in HER2-positive
breast cancer patients, blocks HER2-dependent activation of
intracellular signaling pathways such as the phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt/mTOR cascade, thus explaining its
antiproliferative and apoptotic functions (1). However, almost
half of the HER2-positive breast cancers show primary resistance to trastuzumab or become resistant following chronic
exposure to trastuzumab. This highlights the need to identify
predictive factors of response to trastuzumab therapy.

In most cases, the resistance can be explained by reactivation of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway (2, 3). One of the most
prominent downstream effectors of mTOR signaling is the
eukaryotic initiation factor 4E (eIF4E)–4E-BP1 axis (4). The
eIF4E eukaryotic translation–initiation factor, engaged with
eIF4A and eIF4G in the eIF4F complex, recognizes the 50 -cap
(m7GTP) structure present on all nuclear-transcribed mRNAs.
EIF4E controls the main rate-limiting steps of eukaryotic
translation involved in the recruitment of the small 40S
ribosomal subunit to mRNAs. EIF4E can bind hypophosphorylated 4E-BP1 with high affinity, impairing its ability to bind
eIF4G for the formation of an active eIF4F complex. mTORmediated phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 stimulates translation
through its dissociation from eIF4E (ref. 5; Fig. 1A).
Furthermore, because high levels of eIF4E and phosphorylated 4E-BP1 indicate poor prognosis in breast cancer (6–10),
we reasoned that the assembly of the eIF4F complex might be
important in understanding the trastuzumab-dependent
effects and, more generally, the effects of anticancer drugs
targeting the HER family.

oped CAL33-LTE by treating cells with increasing amounts of
erlotinib for 6 months (Supplementary Fig. S2). Although an
erlotinib-dependent decrease in both the phosphorylation of
4E-BP1 and the formation of the eIF4F complex was observed
in the CAL33 parental cell line, this effect was not seen in
CAL33-LTE cells with acquired resistance to erlotinib (Fig. 1D
and Supplementary Fig. S1B). These results indicate that
several drugs targeting at least 2 members of the HER family
of tyrosine kinase receptors (HER1 and HER2) may exert part
of their effects through the formation of the eIF4F complex.
To elucidate the role of eIF4F in the response to anticancer
drugs targeting the HER family members, we focused on
BT-474 cells. We attempted to restore the formation of the
eIF4F complex by ectopically expressing eIF4E, thereby titrating the dephosphorylated 4E-BP1 inhibitory protein generated
with trastuzumab treatment. Ectopic expression of a hemagglutinin (HA) epitope-tagged eIF4E in BT-474 cells [Fig. 2A;
compare BT-474 (WT) with BT-474 (4E) that express the HAtagged eIF4E] led to a loss in the trastuzumab-dependent
decrease in eIF4F formation, as revealed by the presence of the
same quantity of eIF4E-bound eIF4G in trastuzumab-treated
BT-474 (4E) cells as compared with untreated cells (Fig. 2B).
To investigate the effects of the trastuzumab-mediated
changes in eIF4F complex formation on translation of specific
mRNAs, we analyzed how these mRNAs are regulated in their
recruitment to polysomes because differential translation
usually involves a change in the number of ribosomes
bound to mRNAs. We focused on the CXCR4 mRNA whose

dose-dependent decrease in the hyperphosphorylated fastermigrating forms (b and g) of 4E-BP1 in both cell lines (Fig. 1B).
This effect was linked to a dose-dependent decrease in 4E-BP1
phosphorylation at serine 65 (Ser65; Fig. 1B).
Because dephosphorylation of 4E-BP1 was expected to
reduce the formation of the eIF4F complex, we examined
the integrity of eIF4F. Synthetic m7GTP-Sepharose beads (GE
Health Lifesciences) were used to capture eIF4E and its binding partners, eIF4G and 4E-BP1. Consistent with the trastuzumab-dependent dephosphorylation of 4E-BP1, the quantity
of eIF4E-bound 4E-BP1 was increased whereas the quantity
of eIF4E-bound eIF4G, that is, the formation of the active
eIF4F complex, was decreased in trastuzumab-treated cells
without any effects on the global quantity of these translationinitiation factors (Fig. 1C).
To explore the possibility that a reduction in eIF4F complex
formation occurs in a more general way when using anti-HER
drugs, we conducted experiments on 2 human colon cancer
cell lines, HCT-8 and HCT-116, that were, respectively, responsive and nonresponsive to cetuximab (Erbitux, ImClone), a
chimeric (mouse–human) monoclonal antibody directed
against the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR/HER1;
ref. 12). We found that 4E-BP1 was dephosphorylated (Supplementary Fig. S1A) and that eIF4F complex formation was
reduced in cetuximab-treated HCT-8, but not HCT-116 cells
(Fig. 1D). Furthermore, we used erlotinib, an EGFR tyrosine
kinase inhibitor, on the human head and neck tumor cell line
CAL33, which displays high EGFR expression (13). We devel-

increase in eIF4E expression was sufficient to counteract
the growth-inhibitory effects of trastuzumab in cell culture
as shown by analysis of the proliferation rates of BT-474 (WT)
and BT-474 (4E) cells (Fig. 3A). Consistent with these proliferation results, flow cytometric analysis revealed a reduction
in the ability of trastuzumab to block cells in the G1-phase of
the cell cycle in BT-474 (4E) cells, as compared with BT-474
(WT) cells (Fig. 3B). Notably, these data are supported by
recent findings showing that 4E-BP1 is a major effector of cell
proliferation and cell-cycle progression (15). The antitumor
activity of trastuzumab was further studied in a xenograft
model derived from BT-474 (WT) and BT-474 (4E) cells. As
expected from previous studies (16), trastuzumab treatment
resulted in suppressed tumor growth of BT-474 (WT) xenografts, as judged by measurement of the tumor volume

translation was shown to be regulated by trastuzumab (14).
Polysome gradients were prepared from untreated cells or
trastuzumab-treated BT-474 cells. Real-time reverse transcriptase (RT)-PCR analysis showed a trastuzumab-dependent
decrease in the presence of the CXCR4 mRNA, but not the
actin mRNA, in fractions containing translationally engaged
polyribosomes as compared with cytoplasmic extracts
(Fig. 2C); this is consistent with impaired formation of the
eIF4F complex. The distribution of the CXCR4 mRNA was not
regulated by trastuzumab in BT-474 (4E)–expressing cells
(Fig. 2C), showing that the translational status of this mRNA,
but not of the actin mRNA, is modified in BT-474 (4E) cells, as
compared with BT-474 (WT) cells.
We next analyzed the effect of trastuzumab on the growth
phenotype of the above-mentioned cell lines. The slight

(Fig. 3C), histologic examination, and Ki67/MIB1 immunostaining of the tumor (Fig. 3D). In contrast, the BT-474 (4E)
tumors poorly responded to trastuzumab (Fig. 3C and D).
These findings are consistent with a role of eIF4E, through
eIF4F complex formation, in the development of resistance to
trastuzumab.
These observations led us to investigate whether the
expression of eIF4E and/or the phosphorylation of 4E-BP1
could predict trastuzumab resistance in the clinical setting.
We, therefore, retrospectively analyzed initial tumor biopsy
samples from 53 patients presenting with HER2-overexpressing invasive breast carcinoma, using immunohistochemistry (Fig. 4A). These patients received trastuzumab-based
neoadjuvant treatment, and we analyzed the pathologic
response to neoadjuvant treatment on surgical specimens.
Pathologic response was not statistically correlated to the
initial clinicopathologic characteristics such as age, clinical
tumor size, Elston and Ellis histologic grade, or hormonal
receptor (estrogen and progesterone receptors) status
(Supplementary Table S2). Although the pathologic response
was not associated with the phosphorylation status of 4EBP1, it was statistically correlated to eIF4E expression in the
initial biopsy specimens, when considering both qualitative

(Supplementary Table S2; P ¼ 0.009) and quantitative
(Fig. 4B; P ¼ 0.0117) variables. High eIF4E expression in
initial tumor biopsy specimens was strongly associated with
a pIR. Indeed, 18 of 39 (46.2%) patients with tumors expressing high levels of eIF4E did not have a pCR, as opposed to
only 1 of 14 (7.1%) pIR in patients with tumors expressing
low levels of eIF4E.
In conclusion, our findings indicate that the expression of
eIF4E should be taken into account as a marker of resistance
to anti-HER therapies. EIF4E may become a promising
immunohistochemical surrogate marker of multiple
upstream defects such as PTEN loss, or activating mutations
in PI3K subunits. Furthermore, it may be worth considering
the combined use of trastuzumab and pharmacologic agents
targeting downstream players in the transduction cascade,
such as mTOR, to reverse trastuzumab resistance. Indeed,
data from a phase I clinical trial conducted on women with
HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer suggested that everolimus, an mTOR inhibitor, could overcome resistance to
trastuzumab (17). The observed benefit may be due to a
better efficiency in the dephosphorylation of 4E-BP1 and,
therefore, in the production of the eIF4E inhibitor. To
confirm this hypothesis, the expression status of eIF4E

and of phosphorylated forms of 4E-BP1 should be evaluated
in this series of tumors.
Because the observations described in this article
indicate that the formation of eIF4F is a critical determinant of the response to anticancer drugs targeting
both HER2 and EGFR, it may be of great interest to
develop anti-eIF4E therapies (18, 19) that may be used in
combination with anti-HER2/EGFR drugs in a selected
population of patients with high levels of eIF4E in their
tumors. The recently reported clinical study using ribavirin, a physical mimic of the m7 GTP cap, in patients
with acute myeloid leukemia (20) clearly highlights this
perspective.
