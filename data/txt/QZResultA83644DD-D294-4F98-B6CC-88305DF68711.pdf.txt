Abstract
Persistent unopposed estrogen stimulation is a central oncogenic mechanism driving the formation of type I endometrial
cancer. Recent epidemiologic and clinical studies of endometrial cancer have also revealed a role for insulin resistance,
clinically manifested by chronic inﬂammation. However, the
role of inﬂammation in estrogen-driven endometrial cancer is
not well characterized. In this study, we investigated the
association between inﬁltrating macrophages and estrogen
sensitivity in endometrial cancer. Evaluating tissue samples
and serum from patients with precancerous lesions or endometrial cancer, we found that tissue macrophage inﬁltration,
but not serum estradiol levels, correlated positively with endometrial cancer development. Furthermore, IL4/IL13-induced
CD68þCD163þ macrophages enhanced the proliferative

effects of estradiol in endometrial cancer cells by upregulating
estrogen receptor alpha (ERa), but not ERb. Mechanistic
investigations revealed that CD68þCD163þ macrophages
secreted cytokines, such as IL17A, that upregulated ERa expression through TET1-mediated epigenetic modulation of the ERa
gene. Overall, our ﬁndings show how cytokines produced
by inﬁltrating macrophages in the endometrial microenvironment can induce epigenetic upregulation of ERa expression,
which in turn sensitizes endometrial cells to estrogen stimulation. The concept that inﬂammation-induced estrogen sensitivity in the endometrium acts as a driver of type I endometrial cancer has implications for inﬁltrating macrophages as a
prognostic biomarker of progression in this disease setting.

Introduction

with no such exposure (2). In another study, Simon and colleagues showed no increased risk of endometrial hyperplasia and
carcinoma in 541 postmenopausal women undergoing treatment
with unopposed 10 mg estradiol vaginal tablets for 1 year (3).
These ﬁndings suggest that mechanisms other than unopposed
estrogen exposure may exist to promote the development of
estrogen-driven endometrial cancer.
Epidemiologic studies have revealed a strong association
between endometrial cancer and insulin resistance (IR) as
well as inﬂammation (4–7), and inﬂammation is one of the
most signiﬁcant clinical manifestations of IR (8). In agreement with this clinical ﬁnding, macrophage inﬁltration, a
speciﬁc manifestation of chronic inﬂammation, was found
to be positively correlated with development of many kinds
of cancers, including endometrial cancer (9, 10). The mechanism(s) involved in the association of inﬁltrating macrophages and cancer development is still unclear. Studies indicate that macrophages might be involved in regulation of sex
hormone receptors in hormone-related cancers: in prostate
cancer, inﬁltrating macrophages can upregulate androgen
receptor (AR) expression and enhance the oncogenic activity
of AR (11, 12), and in breast cancer, obesity-induced chronic
inﬂammation can activate estrogen receptor (ER) in cancer
cells (13). On the basis of the above ﬁndings, we hypothesized that inﬁltrating macrophages might be involved in the
development of endometrial cancer by regulating ER expression or activity in endometrial cells.

Unopposed estrogen exposure has long been regarded as the
main cause for type I endometrioid cancer (1). However, in a
recent 14-year-long cohort study that included 1,017 women with
an intact uterus and ages 50 to 69 years, Cherry and colleagues
found that the risk of endometrial cancer in women exposed to
long-term unopposed estrogen was no higher than that in women

Macrophages Increase Estrogen Sensitivity in EC

Macrophages are widely distributed innate immune cells
that play indispensable roles in the innate and adaptive
immune response to pathogens and in-tissue homeostasis.
There are different types of macrophages that play differing
roles in the development of cancer (14, 15). These include the
classically activated (M1) macrophage and the alternatively
activated (M2) macrophage subsets. M1 macrophages are
thought to have the ability to kill pathogens and tumor cells
by secreting high levels of proinﬂammatory cytokines (16). In
contrast, M2 macrophages, of which CD163, CD204, and
CD206 are the major markers, are reported to inhibit immune
response and promote cancer development (17). There are also
reports that subdivide M2 macrophages into different subtypes
(15–19). Because the exact subtypes and function of M2
macrophages remain unclear (20), we will only discuss in this
paper the role of CD68þCD163þ macrophages (CD68 is the
common marker for macrophages) in the progression of endometrial cancer.
There are several mechanisms involved in activation of ER,
including genetic mutations and epigenetic alterations (21);
and inﬂammation is reported to be involved in epigenetic
modulation. In gastrointestinal smooth muscle, cytokines take
part in epigenetic control of the smooth muscle phenotypic
switch (22). Inﬂammation (both pro- and anti-inﬂammatory
processes) is thought to mediate exercise-induced DNA methylation (23). Yet it is not clear whether macrophages can
activate ER through epigenetic modulation of secreted
cytokines.
In the present study, we evaluated the effects of CD68þ
CD163þ macrophages on estrogen-driven endometrial cancer
proliferation and further investigated the molecular mechanism
(s) underlying ER expression as regulated by CD68þCD163þ
macrophages.

Materials and Methods
Ethics statement
This study complied with the tenets of the Helsinki Declaration,
and was approved by the Medical Ethics Committee of the
Obstetrics and Gynecology Hospital of Fudan University (Shanghai, P.R. China, hereafter referred to as `Ob&Gyn Hospital'). All
patients signed an informed consent form before participating in
the study.
Patient collection and serum hormone analysis
We collected two groups of patients for serum hormone
analysis. The ﬁrst group was a total of 411 cases including
64 cases of disordered proliferative endometrium (DPE), 159
simple hyperplasia (SH), 65 complex hyperplasia (CH), 31
endometrial atypical hyperplasia (EAH), 53 endometrioid cancer, and 39 healthy controls. Patient information is seen in
Supplementary Table S1. Serum estradiol, progesterone, and
sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) levels were analyzed
among these patients. The second group was composed of 34
endometrial cancer patients and 34 age-paired healthy controls,
and serum estradiol levels were compared between them. "Agepaired" herein implies that every endometrial cancer patient
had one healthy control of the same age or at least within an
error range of no more than 1 year. Patient inclusion and
exclusion criteria are seen in Supplementary Materials and
Methods.

Serum estradiol and progesterone level were measured with
chemical luminex immunoassay (Beckman Coulter) and SHBG
with electrochemiluminescence assay (Roche).
Endometrial sample collection and IHC
Thirty cases of normal endometrium in the proliferative
phase, 34 hyperplasia, 16 EAH, and 40 endometrial cancer
cases were collected. Patient collection and information are
seen in Supplementary Material and Methods and Supplementary Table S2. Inclusion and exclusion criteria were the same as
mentioned above. Sections from the tissues were used for IHC
assessment of CD68 and CD163. Tissue microarray was also
generated from these tissue samples for IHC staining for IL17A,
ten-eleven translocation 1 (TET1), 5-hydroxymethylcytosine
(5-hmC), and ERa. Tissue microarray blocks were constructed
using a Manual Tissue Arrayer 1 (Beecher Instruments.) according to the manufacturer's instructions.
IHC and semiquantitative optical analysis was performed as
described previously (24) and seen in Supplementary Materials
and Methods. Primary antibodies to CD68, CD163, and IL17A
were purchased from Abcam, ERa and TET1 from Sigma-Aldrich,
and 5-hmC from Active Motif. Rabbit immunoglobulin G alone
was used as a negative control.
Cell culture and proliferation evaluation

BRL).
The human acute monocytic leukemia cell line (THP-1) was
purchased from the ATCC and cultured in RPMI 1640 (Gibco
BRL) with 10% FBS.
Cells were required to be starved in opti-MEM (Invitrogen)
without FBS for 18 to 24 hours before initiating the experiment.
The CCK8 kit (Dojindo) was used to evaluate cell proliferation
following the manufacturer's instructions.
Drug treatment
Starved cells reaching 80% conﬂuence were treated with
17b-estradiol (E2), IL17A, or the selective ER antagonist Fulvestrant (ICI 182,780), which were all purchased from Sigma-Aldrich.
Cells were treated with 109 M 17b-estradiol or 50 ng/mL IL17A
if not speciﬁcally indicated. IL6 and CXCL11 were purchased from
Pepro Tech, USA; IL10 and TGFb1 from Sigma-Aldrich. IL17
receptor (IL17R) antibody was from R&D Systems.
siRNA, plasmid construct, and transient transfection
The TET1 small interfering RNA (si-TET1; Dharmacon) was
transfected into HEC-1-A cells in the presence of Hiperfect transfection reagent (Dharmacon). The si-Con served as a transfection
control.
The plasmid pcDNA-ESR1 (ESR1 is the gene encoding ERa
protein, the plasmid was kept in our lab), pcDNA-TET1-ﬂag
(kindly provided by Prof. Zhao Shimin, Fudan University), or
pPB-TET1 plasmid (kindly provided by Prof. Shi Yujiang, Harvard

Total DNA was extracted using a QIAamp DNA Mini Kit
(QIAGEN). One mL DNA (500 ng/mL) was dropped on nitrocellulose membranes and irradiated by a UV lamp (2,000 w) for 15
minutes to cross-link DNA, and then incubated with 5-hmC
primary antibody (Abcam). Secondary antibody (Jackson) was
applied and detected by ECL regent, with methylene blue stain as a
loading control.

ANOVA were used for appropriate analyses. The P value was set to
0.05 (two-tailed) as the signiﬁcance test level. Each experiment
was repeated at least three times. Error bars indicated SD in the
graphs.

Results
Serum estradiol levels are not elevated in patients with
endometrial hyperplasic diseases or type I endometrial
carcinoma
Because long-term estrogen stimulation without progesterone protection is believed to be the main mechanism in the
carcinogenesis of endometrial cancer, we ﬁrst evaluated serum
estradiol levels in both healthy controls and patients with
various endometrial disorders, including DPE, SH, CH, EAH,
and endometrioid cancer (Fig. 1A1). We found that the serum
estradiol levels in patients with DPE, SH, CH, and EAH were
not different from those of normal controls. Serum estradiol
levels in endometrial cancer patients were lower than those in
the other groups. We further subdivided endometrial cancer
patients according to pathologic grade as endometrioid cancer
grade 1 (G1), grade 2 (G2), or grade 3 (G3; Supplementary Fig.
S1A1), and found that serum estradiol levels were lower in all
three endometrial cancer subgroups compared with that of
controls.

1356 Cancer Res; 76(6) March 15, 2016

We found a difference in the average age among groups of
patients studied, with that of endometrial cancer patients older
than the control group, and with the average age of CH patients
younger than that of the controls (Fig. 1B1 and Supplementary
Fig. S1B1). Because ovarian function is signiﬁcantly affected by
age, we stratiﬁed patients according to age to eliminate this
possible cause of bias. The results showed serum estradiol levels
as well as age distribution in endometrial cancer patients
between 25 years and 40 years were not different from other
groups (Fig. 1A2 and 1B2 and Supplementary Figs. S1A2 and
S1B2). Serum estradiol level in endometrial cancer patients
between 41 years and 55 years was lower than other groups
(Fig. 1A3 and Supplementary Fig. S1A3). However, the average
age of this group was still higher than in other groups (Fig. 1B3
and Supplementary Fig. S1B3).
To further eliminate possible bias caused by age and to conﬁrm
our ﬁndings, we analyzed another group of 34 endometrial cancer
patients and compared them with 34 age-paired healthy volunteers (Fig. 1C and Supplementary Fig. S1C). No signiﬁcant difference in serum estradiol levels was found between the two
groups.
The above ﬁndings indicated that serum estradiol levels
were not elevated in endometrial cancer and endometrial
hyperplasia patients. There are many factors affecting serum
estradiol activity; among them, serum SHBG is one of the
most important factors. SHBG can bind and deactivate serum
estradiol and lower the active circulating estradiol. We found
that serum SHBG was lower in EAH and endometrial cancer
groups compared with other groups (Fig. 1D and Supplementary Fig. S1D). But there were no signiﬁcant differences in E2/
SHBG ratios among any of the groups except for an increased
E2/SHBG ratio in the SH group (Fig. 1E and Supplementary
Fig. S1E).
A lack of progesterone protection is another key mechanism in
endometrial carcinogenesis. But we did not ﬁnd differences in
serum progesterone levels among patients in any of the groups
(Fig. 1F and Supplementary Fig. S1F).
Results of serum sex hormone analysis indicated that circulating estradiol was not elevated in patients with endometrial cancer
or its precancerous diseases. However, increased local estradiol
levels in endometrium or increased estradiol sensitivity of endometrial cells might be a key mechanism(s) in the carcinogenesis of
endometrial cancer. We thus focused on the possible mechanisms
of increased local estradiol sensitivity.
Macrophage inﬁltration is positively correlated with
development of endometrial hyperplasia and endometrioid
cancer
On the basis of the ﬁndings that macrophage inﬁltration is
correlated with cancer development (14, 15) and can upregulate
androgen receptor in prostate cancer (12), we hypothesized that
macrophage inﬁltration might play roles in enhancing estradiol
sensitivity in endometrium. Although M2 macrophages are
reported to facilitate tumor progression (29), the subtype and
function of M2 macrophage are far from clear (15–19). We
focused on CD68þ (macrophage-speciﬁc marker) and CD163þ
(possible M2 macrophage marker) macrophages only in this
study. Using serial sections of endometrial tissue samples, IHC
staining (Fig. 2A) showed that the inﬁltration pattern in different
endometrial lesion was similar between CD68þ cells and CD163þ
cells. CD68þ cells and CD163þ cells were found mostly in tissue

mesenchyme. And macrophages also presented in necrotic spot in
endometrial cancer lesion. Because necrotic spot presents only in
cancer lesion, we focused on the inﬁltrated macrophages in
mesenchyme only. Inﬁltration of CD68þ cells and CD163þ cells
increased gradually from normally proliferative endometrium,
hyperplasia to endometrial cancer, which was the highest in EAH
and endometrioid adenocarcinoma G1, and decreased when
the cancer lesions progressed to grade 2 and grade 3. Immunoﬂuorescence staining conﬁrmed that CD163-expressing cells in
endometrial lesion also express CD68 (Fig. 2B). These results
indicated that macrophage inﬁltration is positively correlated
with carcinogenesis of endometrioid adenocarcinoma, and most
of these macrophages are possible CD68þCD163þ M2 macrophages. The highest inﬁltration of CD68þCD163þ macrophages
in EAH and endometrioid adenocarcinoma G1 suggested that
CD68þCD163þ macrophages might play important roles in
helping endometrial cells attaining their malignant properties in
the early stage of carcinogenesis.

CD68þCD163þ macrophages enhance estradiol-driven
endometrial cancer cell proliferation
To test our hypothesis that inﬁltrating macrophages might play
roles in upregulating estradiol sensitivity in endometrium, we
asked whether CD68þCD163þ macrophages could enhance
estradiol-driven endometrial cancer cell proliferation.
We ﬁrst induced CD68þCD163þ macrophages from THP-1 cells
(Supplementary Materials and Methods and Supplementary Fig.
S2). Macrophages are terminally differentiated and cannot proliferate, so we cocultured CD68þCD163þ macrophages with endometrial cancer cells to evaluate whether they could stimulate proliferation of endometrial cancer cells. Two different endometrial
cancer cell lines, Ishikawa and HEC-1-A cells, were used and cocultured with CD68þCD163þ macrophages in different cell-number
ratios. As shown in Fig. 3A, CD68þCD163þ macrophages signiﬁcantly stimulated proliferation in both endometrial cancer cell lines.
We then asked whether CD68þCD163þ macrophages promoted endometrial cancer cell proliferation by secreting cytokines. We

cultured endometrial cancer cells with only conditioned medium
(CM) from CD68þCD163þ macrophages, and the results showed
that CM also elicited a positive and signiﬁcant effect on the
proliferation of both Ishikawa and HEC-1-A cells (Fig. 3B).
Consistent with the increased proliferation, the expression of
cyclin D1, an indicator of cell proliferation, was also upregulated
by CM in endometrial cancer cells in a time-dependent manner
(Fig. 3C).
To explore whether CD68þCD163þ macrophages were associated with estradiol sensitivity in endometrial cancer cells, we

analyzed the relative proliferative rates of endometrial cancer
cells in response to estradiol in the presence or absence of
CD68þCD163þ macrophage CM (Fig. 3D). We found that
although 17b-estradiol could stimulate Ishikawa cell proliferation, the proliferation was more signiﬁcant after adding CM. It
is notable because of the relatively weak expression of ERa in
HEC-1-A cells (Supplementary Fig. S3), that the proliferative
stimulation of estradiol alone on HEC-1-A cells was moderate
(Fig. 3D). However, the addition of CM signiﬁcantly enhanced
the effect of estradiol-driven proliferation in HEC-1-A cells.

In summary, our ﬁndings above showed that CD68þCD163þ
macrophages or their conditioned medium could enhance estradiol-driven endometrial cancer cell proliferation. This indicated
that CD68þCD163þ macrophages may be involved in the regulation of the estradiol-driven, pro-proliferative pathway in endometrial cancer cells, and that this might be achieved through
cytokines secreted by CD68þCD163þ macrophages. There might
be two possible mechanisms involved: (1) cytokines in CM
secreted by CD68þCD163þ macrophages upregulate ERa in
endometrial cancer cells; and (2) macrophages secrete estrogen
directly and promote endometrial cancer cell proliferation.
Because we found in HEC-1-A cells (Fig. 3D) that cellular proliferation was not stimulated signiﬁcantly even at high estradiol
concentrations (indicating that higher estrogen concentrations
might not be the key factor in promoting HEC-1-A cell proliferation), we now suggest that upregulated ERa expression might be
the key mechanism in promoting endometrial cancer cell proliferation after addition of CM from CD68þCD163þ macrophages.
ERa is an adaptor for CD68þCD163þ macrophage-enhanced,
estradiol-driven proliferation
To further investigate the molecular pathway(s) underlying
the proliferation stimulating effect of CD68þCD163þ macrophages on endometrial cancer cells and to elucidate the role of
ERs in this process, we treated endometrial cancer cells with the
selective ERa antagonist fulvestrant (ICI 182,780). We found

1360 Cancer Res; 76(6) March 15, 2016

that ICI was able to inhibit the effect of CD68þCD163þ
macrophages on estradiol-induced proliferation in both Ishikawa and HEC-1-A cells in both contact coculture manner
(Fig. 4A) and when the endometrial cancer cells were cultured
with CM of CD68þCD163þ macrophages (Fig. 4B), indicating
that CD68þCD163þ macrophages might promote estradioldriven endometrial cancer cell proliferation by activating ERs
in endometrial cancer cells.
To validate the effect of CD68þCD163þ macrophages on
activating ERs in endometrial cancer cells, we analyzed the
changes in ER expression in endometrial cancer cells upon the
addition of CM. Western blot analysis demonstrated that CM
of CD68þCD163þ macrophages caused an upregulation in
ERa expression but not in ERb expression in both Ishikawa
and HEC-1-A cells (Fig. 4C), and ERa expression was upregulated
in a time-dependent manner in response to the addition of CM
(Fig. 4D). In addition, overexpression of ERa in HEC-1-A cells
enhanced estradiol-driven proliferation, similar to the effects
of CM (Fig. 4E). Collectively, these results suggest that
CD68þCD163þ macrophages enhance estradiol-driven proliferation by increasing ERa expression in endometrial cancer cells.

proliferation of endometrial cancer cells makes us hypothesize
that such proliferative stimulation is mediated by cytokines
secreted by CD68þCD163þ macrophages. To screen for possible
cytokines that might mediate the proliferation-stimulating effect
of CD68þCD163þ macrophages on endometrial cancer cells, we
screened cytokines produced in CD68þCD163þ macrophages in
the presence of HEC-1-A cells or vice versa. We found that IL6,
IL10, IL17A, CXCL11, and TGFb1 were the cytokines stably
upregulated in both macrophages and HEC-1-A cells (Fig. 5A1
and 5A2).
To decide on the key cytokine promoting estradiol-driven
endometrial cancer cell proliferation, we further investigated the
effect of all the ﬁve cytokines on ERa and ERb expression in HEC1-A cells. Intriguingly, all ﬁve factors were able to upregulate ERa
but not ERb expression, and IL17A demonstrated the most
signiﬁcant effect (Fig. 5B). Western blot analysis conﬁrmed that
IL17A upregulated ERa expression in a time-dependent and dosedependent manner (Fig. 5C). The effect of IL17A on ERa expression and transcription was compromised when we blocked IL17R
with its speciﬁc antibody (Fig. 5D and Supplementary Fig. S4),
indicating that IL17A upregulated ERa in endometrial cancer cells
via IL17R.
To conﬁrm the premise that IL17A upregulation of ERa is
functional and can promote endometrial cancer cell proliferation, we used a cell proliferation test to see whether IL17A was
sufﬁcient to enhance estradiol-driven proliferation of endometrial cancer cells. As shown in Fig. 5E, both IL17A and a
physiologic concentration (109 mol/L) of estradiol could
stimulate the proliferation of HEC-1-A cells. This proliferation
was signiﬁcantly upregulated when cells were treated with
IL17A and 17b-estradiol in combination. We then overexpressed ERa in HEC-1-A cells by plasmid transfection and
found that the endometrial cancer cell proliferation was upregulated after ERa overexpression, and this cellular proliferation
was comparable with those treated with 17b-estradiol and/or
IL17A (Fig. 5F), suggesting that IL17A promotes HEC-1-A cell
proliferation by activating the ERa signaling pathway.
To conﬁrm this ﬁnding, we compared the activation of downstream cellular proliferation pathways after treatment with IL17A
or by overexpressing ERa. As shown in Supplementary Fig. S5,
IL17A treatment and overexpression of ERa activated the cellular
proliferation pathway PI3K/AKT and cyclin D1 expression to a
similar extent. Taken together, these ﬁndings conﬁrmed that
IL17A is involved in CD68þCD163þ macrophage-stimulated
endometrial cancer cell proliferation by regulating the ERa
pathway.
We then investigated the possible mechanism(s) involved
in upregulation of ERa by IL17A. We ﬁrst evaluated the effect of

IL17A on ERa transcription with or without estrogen stimulation,
and found that both IL17A and 17b-estradiol promoted ERa but
not ERb transcription in HEC-1-A cells, and that this effect was
most signiﬁcant when HEC-1-A cells were treated with IL17A and
17b-estradiol in combination (Fig. 5G). This indicated that IL17A
might promote ERa expression in endometrial cancer cells by
activating ERa gene (ESR1) transcription. We then investigated
possible mechanism(s) involved in IL17A upregulation of ESR1
transcription.
TET1-mediated 5-hydroxymethylation of the ERa gene
promoter is involved in IL17A upregulation of ERa expression
Abnormal DNA hydroxymethylation has been reported to
be involved in the development of various cancers (30).
We thereby used tissue microarray from clinical samples to
evaluate a potential relationship among IL17A, ERa expression,
and DNA hydroxymethylation. We evaluated TET1 and 5-hmC
as the two markers for DNA hydroxymethylation. TET1 is one
of the primary components of the ten-eleven translocation
5-methylcytosine dioxygenase family, and catalyzes the conversion of 5-methylcytosine (5-mC) to 5-hmC (31). Abnormal
TET1 expression has been associated with the development of
multiple types of cancer (30). 5-hmC, a modiﬁed cytosine
base that facilitates gene expression, is a critical epigenetic
marker of DNA hydroxymethylation (32). As is shown in Fig.
6A, there were parallel increases in the levels of IL17A, TET1,
5-hmC, and ERa when endometrial lesions developed from
hyperplasia, and progressed from EAH to endometrial cancer.
The immunostaining of IL17A, TET1, and 5-hmC showed the
highest expression in EAH; and when the lesions progressed
from endometrioid adenocarcinoma G1 to G3, the expression
of TET1 and 5-hmC (as well as IL17A and ERa) decreased. IHC
scores of the four markers were calculated by semiquantitative
optical analysis (Supplementary Fig. S6). There were positive
correlations between IL17A expression and TET1, 5-hmC, or
ERa (Fig. 6B).
To further investigate the role of hydroxymethylation in
IL17A-induced ERa expression, we measured the expression
change of TET1 in endometrial cancer cells treated with IL17A.
Western blot analysis revealed that IL17A upregulated TET1
expression in endometrial cancer cells in a time- and dosedependent manner (Fig. 6C). When endogenous TET1 in the
endometrial cancer cells was silenced by siRNA, the IL17Ainduced ERa mRNA as well as protein expression was attenuated (Fig. 6D). On the other hand, overexpression of TET1
enhanced ERa expression even without IL17A treatment (Fig.
6E). These ﬁndings suggested that TET1 is involved in IL17Ainduced ERa expression.

manners. TET1 expression was analyzed by Western blot. D, silencing TET1 compromises IL17A upregulation of ERa. HEC-1-A cells transfected with si-TET1/si-Con

We then asked whether IL17A promoted ERa gene transcription through hydroxymethylation of the ERa gene promoter by
TET1. We ﬁrst detected the global level of 5-hmC in endometrial cancer cells treated with IL17A, and dot-blot analysis (Fig.
6F) showed that global DNA hydroxymethylation was upregulated after IL17A treatment. To further conﬁrm the involvement
of TET1 in the epigenetic regulation of ERa expression, we
analyzed hydroxymethylation status of the ERa gene promoter
region in HEC-1-A cells by silencing or overexpressing TET1.
Primer for ERa gene promoter region was synthesized (Supplementary Table S3). HMeDIP assay (Fig. 6G) showed that
silencing TET1 by siRNA compromised ERa gene promoter
hydroxymethylation, whereas overexpression of TET1 in

IL17A promotes ERa gene transcription through hydroxymethylation of the ERa gene promoter by TET1.

Discussion
It is well documented that type I endometrial cancer is hormone
related, with unopposed estrogen stimulation as the primary
oncogenic mechanism. Type I endometrial cancer has clear precancerous stages, from DPE, hyperplasia, atypical hyperplasia,
and progresses onward to endometrial cancer; and estrogen
stimulation is involved in every step of endometrial cancer
development and progression (33, 34). Putting these unique
features of endometrial cancer to our advantage, we examined

both endometrial cancer and its precancerous diseases to seek a
better understanding of endometrial cancer development.
Serum hormone analysis showed that serum estradiol was not
elevated in endometrial cancer and hyperplasia patients or even
decreased in endometrial cancer patients after adjusting for age. In
addition, the protective factors against estrogen stimulation, such
as serum progesterone level, were not found to be decreased when
endometrial lesions progressed from hyperplasia to cancer. These
ﬁndings indicated that increased local estrogen sensitivity in
endometrium, rather than increased circulating estrogen levels,
might be the most important contributing factor to estrogendriven endometrial tumorigenesis.
Studies have shown the correlation of chronic inﬂammation
and endometrial cancer (4, 35). But the correlation of inﬂammation and endometrial hyperplasia is still unclear. We demonstrated that the inﬁltrating macrophages were present at early stages of
endometrial hyperplasia, and the degree of macrophage inﬁltration was positively correlated with the progression of endometrial
hyperplasia to cancer. The lack of an increase in circulating
estradiol levels and the presence of an increase in macrophage
inﬁltration strongly suggested that inﬁltrating macrophages in
endometrial lesions might contribute to the sensitization of
endometrial cells to estrogen stimulation.
The mechanism(s) of macrophage inﬁltration and development of endometrial cancer is still unclear. It was reported that
macrophages contribute to tumor development and progression by promoting cancer cell proliferation, invasion, metastasis, and angiogenesis; and by inhibiting cytotoxic T-cell
activity (36–38). In the present study, we proposed a model
of the relationship between the inﬂammatory microenvironment and estradiol-driven endometrial cancer cell proliferation
(Fig. 7). In brief, monocytes are recruited into endometrial
lesions and polarized into CD68þCD163þ macrophages. Inﬁltrating CD68þCD163þ macrophages upregulate inﬂammatory
cytokines in endometrial lesions, including IL17A. The latter
promotes TET1 expression in endometrial cancer cells. TET1mediated hydroxymethylation of the ESR1 gene promoter is
involved in IL17A-induced ERa expression. Elevated ERa levels
then increase estrogen sensitivity in endometrial cancer cells,
which in turn stimulates endometrial cancer cell proliferation
through the PI3K/AKT pathway.
It is interesting to note that we found in clinical samples
that the expression of TET1, 5-hmC, and ERa was the highest in
EAH and was then degraded gradually in endometrial cancer
from G1 to G3. We suggest that the TET1-related 5-hmC
modulation plays a role(s) in assisting cells in attaining cancerous properties under the stimulation of estrogen. When cells
gain this property, estrogen is no longer the primary engine
for cancer development, progression, and de-differentiation.
The cancer cells then turn to other more-common stimulators
for proliferation instead of estrogen. Our previous ﬁnding
that endometrial cancer cell proliferation depends more upon
the TGFa-EGFR pathway when cells lose progestrone receptor
and became progestin resistant, supports this hypothesis (39).
Such ﬁndings also suggest that higher expression of TET1 and 5hmC might be indicators of well-differentiated tumors, producing an improved prognosis.
Our data showed that IL17A was upregulated in both macrophages and endometrial cancer cells in the coculture system.
We suppose that inﬁltrating macrophages could upregulate
IL17A in both macrophages and endometrial cells, which

www.aacrjournals.org

caused elevated IL17A in the microenvironment, leading to
increased estrogen sensitivity in endometrium. It is possible
that IL17A produced by both macrophages and endometrial
cancer cells play roles in upregulating ERa in endometrial
cancer cells. However, exogenous IL17A was sufﬁcient to induce
ERa and blocking IL17 receptor reduced ERa expression in
endometrial cancer cells (Fig 5D), which indicates that IL17A
originating from macrophages alone is sufﬁcient to induce ERa
in endometrial cancer cells.
In this paper, we showed signiﬁcant upregulation of ERa
protein in endometrial cancer cells after IL17A treatment. Our
ﬁndings indicate that transcriptional mechanism plays role in
IL17A-driven ERa upregulation. Nevertheless, other mechanisms such as post transcriptional regulation might also be
involved. Studies have shown that ubiquitination regulation
is deeply involved in ER turn over (40), which guarantees
further study.
In conclusion, we found that increased estrogen sensitivity in
the endometrium might be one of the key mechanisms underlying estrogen-driven carcinogenesis of the endometrium. Inﬁltrating macrophages play important roles in increased local estrogen
sensitivity in endometrial lesion. Our ﬁndings provide a new
perspective into the carcinogenesis of endometrial cancer, and
contribute possible targets for the prevention and treatment of
endometrial cancer. The concept that inﬂammation-induced
estrogen sensitivity in the endometrium acts as a driver of type
I endometrial cancer has implications for inﬁltrating macrophages as a prognostic biomarker of progression in this disease
setting.
