ABSTRACT
Reliable biomarkers are required to predict the response to sorafenib.
We investigated genomic variations associated with responsiveness to sorafenib
for patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Blood samples from
2 extreme, 2 strong and 3 poor responders to sorafenib were subjected to wholegenome analysis. Then, we validated candidate genomic variations with another 174
HCC patients, and performed in vitro functional analysis and in silico analyses. Genomic
data of >96 gigabases/sample was generated at average of ~34X sequencing depth. In
total, 1813 genomic variations were matched to sorafenib responses in clinical data; 708
were located within regions for sorafenib-target genes or drug absorption, distribution,
metabolism, and excretion (ADME)-related genes. From them, 36 variants were within
the coding regions and 6 identified as non-synonymous single-nucleotide variants from
4 ADME-related genes (ABCB1, FMO3, MUSK, and SLC15A2). Validation genotyping
confirmed sequencing results and revealed patients genotype for rs2257212 in SLC15A2
showed longer progression-free survival (HR = 2.18). In vitro study displayed different
response to sorafenib depending on the genotype of SLC15A2. Structural prediction
analysis revealed changes of the phosphorylation levels in protein, potentially affecting
sorafenib-associated enzymatic activity. Our finding using extreme responder seems
to generate robust biomarker to predict the response of sorafenib treatment for HCC.

of cancer death worldwide. [1] Because this disease is
mostly diagnosed at an advance stage, potentially curative
therapies are effective in less than 30–40% of HCC
patients. [2, 3] While systemic therapies are indicated for
advanced HCC, no effective systemic therapy for patients

Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most
common types of cancers (with the highest prevalence
in the Asia-Pacific region) and the third leading cause

with advanced HCC existed until the development of
sorafenib therapy. Sorafenib is a multikinase inhibitor
that targets HCC angiogenesis, and it has been shown to
impart survival benefits (2.8 and 2.3 months, respectively)
on patients in Western and Eastern phase III randomized
controlled trials. [4, 5] These trials have established
sorafenib as a first-line treatment option for patients with
advanced HCC, who have sufficiently preserved liver
function. [2, 6]
Sorafenib is known to inhibit receptor tyrosine
kinases in cell membranes (e.g., vascular endothelial
growth factor receptors and platelet-derived growth
factor receptor-beta) and downstream intracellular serine/
threonine kinases (e.g., Raf-1, wild-type B-Raf, and
mutant B-Raf). These kinases are involved in tumor cell
proliferation and tumor angiogenesis. In a previous study,
sorafenib treatment resulted in dose-dependent inhibition of
cell proliferation and induction of apoptosis in human HCC
cells lines in vitro [7]; however, the precise underlying
responsible mechanisms remain largely unknown.
Two phase III clinical trials have shown that about
50–60 percent of the study subjects are non-responders to
sorafenib treatment, and reliable biomarkers are needed for
predicting treatment responses prior to therapy initiation.
[8, 9] In practice, identification of good responders to
sorafenib treatment may be critical for personalized
therapy for management of advanced HCC. Unfortunately,
no such reliable biomarkers or clinical factors currently
have been identified to date. In addition, understanding
the reasons for such differential responses is essential
as is identifying stratification factors such as tumor
molecular profiles and individual genetic differences in
drug metabolism.
To distinguish good responders to sorafenib
treatment from the poor responders, it is necessary to
identify genes or markers related to the sorafenib response.
However, conventional technologies such as massive
PCR amplification and Sanger sequencing are time
consuming and expensive; therefore, a single laboratory
cannot undertake such a study independently. Recently
developed molecular genetics technologies such as nextgeneration sequencing (NGS) are innovative research
tools for detecting genomic variations and are practical
methods for detecting mutations with high accuracy. [10]
In particular, whole-genome sequencing by NGS can be
used to detect all genomic variations in exons, introns,
and regulatory regions such as promoters and enhancers,
[11, 12] allowing a systemic approach to biomarker
identification. Consequently, challenges to identify genomic
variations associated with drug response is emerged by
analyzing the genome of exceptional responder by NGS.
[13] As an effort to this, The National Cancer Institute
(NCI) is funding for researches which are focused to
“super responder” with hope to further identify patients of
good responder using knowledge generated from super
responder.
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

In this study, we present the results of a
whole-genome sequencing analysis to identify sorafenibresponse markers and genes using the peripheral blood
of HCC patients treated with sorafenib. From the patients
who  were treated with sorafenib, we selected two
extraordinary responders who showed time-to-progression
(TTP) more than 38 months and two good responders.
With further three poor responder who showed less than
5 month  TTP, whole genome analysis was performed
followed by bioinformatics analysis to compare their
genomic variations. We identified genome-wide germline
variations associated with the response to sorafenib
treatment, especially in sorafenib-candidate targets and in
absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion (ADME)
genes. Furthermore, we discovered that non-synonymous
single-nucleotide variations (ns SNVs) in solute carrier
family 15 (H+/peptide transporter) member 2 (SLC15A2)
were functionally relevant to sorafenib metabolism by
in silico and in vitro functional study. This finding was
validated by genotyping of another 174 patients with HCC
which revealed statistically significant progression-free
survival (PFS) rate depending on genotype. This is the
first report of precise identification of SNVs as associated
with the extraordinary response to sorafenib treatment, and
our results may prove useful for classifying patients with
advanced HCC on the basis of outcomes from sorafenib
treatment.

RESULTS
Patients demographics
Table 1a shows the baseline demographics and
clinical characteristics of the seven enrolled patients
which were analyzed by whole-genome sequencing.
Five (71.4%) patients were male and HBsAg-positive.
Their median age was 60 years, and all were Child-Pugh
class A. The seven patients were at Barcelona Clinic of
Liver Cancer (BCLC) stages B (n = 4) and C (n = 3). The
median of maximum tumor size was 45 mm, and two
patients exhibited macrovascular invasion. According
to time-to-progression (TTP) with sorafenib treatment,
patients were arbitrarily classified into as being good
responders (n = 4, Nr. 1, 2, 3 and 4 in Table 1a) harboring
two extraordinary responders (Nr. 1 and 2) and poor
responders (n = 3; Nr.5, 6 and 7 in Table 1a). A validation
cohort (Table 1b) comprised 174 patients, with a median
age of 56 years (interquartile range [IQR], 49–63) and
84.5% were male. According to BCLC staging system,
the number of patients with stage A, B, and C HCC were
2 (1.2%), 35 (20.1%), and 137 (78.7%), respectively.
Twenty patients (11.5%) were administered sorafenib
as an initial treatment. The median overall survival
(OS) and PFS of the validation cohort was 11.0 months
(95% CI, 8.9–12.7) and 4.4 months (95% CI, 3.7–5.0),
respectively.

subclasses 2 and 3 were recessive models whereby “A” or
“B” homozygous alleles contributed to the good response
to sorafenib treatment. We uncovered 1813 SNVs that
were perfectly matched to one of these subclasses and
identified as being 100% associated (Supplementary
Table 5), 708 of which were located in the sorafenib target
candidate genes or sorafenib ADME candidate genes
(Supplementary Tables 6 and 7). Among the 708 SNVs, 36
variations were SNVs located in genomic regions, 15 of
which were located in the coding regions of nine genes
(Table 2), all confirmed as being true-positive variants
by Sanger sequencing. Thirteen of these 15 coding SNVs
were confirmed to be located in the drug responsivenessrelated genes, whereas two of them were candidates
as sorafenib target gene. Six coding SNVs were nonsynonymous, which cause amino-acid change and possibly
damage the functions of their encoded proteins, and
located in four genes: MUSK was a sorafenib target gene
candidate; ABCB1, FMO3, and SLC15A2 were ADME
genes (Fig. 1).

On average, >96 gigabase sequences per sample
were generated with a ~32X mapping depth minimum and
at a mapping rate of over 95% to the reference genome
(NCBI build 37, HG19; Supplementary Table 1). This
baseline value of whole-genome sequencing indicates
that we obtained sufficient qualified sequencing reads to
cover the entire genome. Using the final mapped bases,
we constructed a genomic profile database for detecting
SNVs, copy number variations, and structural variations.
For each sample, we identified approximately 0.6 – 0.8
million small indels and approximately 3.9 – 4.1 million
SNVs. The majority of these SNVs was located in the
intron, but a large proportion of SNVs was found in coding
regions and splicing sites—including missense, nonsense,
or frameshift mutations—which may cause functional
changes of affected genes (Supplementary Table 2). The
number of functional SNVs was approximately the same
for all samples without any significant difference between
good and poor responder. All data generated by whole
genome sequencing was deposited in public database
(NCBI SRA, Accession Nr. SRS 428124). Chip data
generated by the genome-wide Axiom array were used for
quality control of the identified SNVs (>99% concordance
rate for each samples; Supplementary Table 3).

Pathway analysis
To further investigate sorafenib-associated variations
at the pathway level, all variations were analyzed by gene
positioning in the functionally annotated KEGG database.
The genes that harbored 1813 genomic variations were
mapped in the KEGG pathways; significantly affected
pathways (P < 0.001) are displayed in Supplementary
Table 8. Interestingly, the outcome of the pathway analysis
was in accordance with that of the marker analysis, and
the drug metabolism pathway (including its components
such as FMO3 and ALDH3B1) were found to be the most
significantly affected. This suggests that these genetic
differences in the patients with HCC are involved in
mechanisms implicated in different responses to sorafenib
treatment.

Identification of sorafenib response-associated 
variations
Genetic pattern analysis was used to identify genetic
variations associated with drug responsiveness in the
genomes of patients. Seven patients were assigned into
two groups according to their sorafenib-responsiveness
(good or poor responders). Alleles different from the
human reference genome were coded as “A,” whereas
alleles found the same as the reference genome were
coded as “B.” This classification conferred four different
genetic patterns in the response to sorafenib treatment, as
shown in Supplementary Table 4. Subclasses 1 and 4 were
dominant models in which “A” or “B” alleles dominantly
contributed to the good sorafenib response, whereas

to validate the genomic variations in SLC15A2. From five
coding variants in SLC15A2 identified by NGS analysis,
we selected three non-synonymous SNVs (L350F, P409S,
R509K), which may cause functional alteration in the gene
product, and analyzed the genotypes for an additional
174 HCC patients (Table 1b). We obtained individual
genotypes of these three SNPs, which displayed complete
linkage disequilibrium (Supplementary Table 9). Because
of missing clinical data, we could only analyze PFS but
not TTP. However, upon analyzing the association between
genotypes and the PFS of these patients, we observed
that cohorts of patients with C/C genotype for rs2257212
(correspond to L350F) showed shorter progression-free
survival time compared to the group of patients with C/T
or T/T genotype (HR, 2.18; 95% CI, 1.15–4.15; P = 0.018)
as it was indicated by NGS analysis. The Kaplan-Meier
plot displayed significant genotype-dependent difference
for PFS of 174 patients (Fig. 2) which may be caused by
different drug responsiveness for sorafenib. Additional
analysis by pair-wise addition of SNPs in coding variants
to Cox proportional hazard model with SLC15A2 did not
significantly improve model predictability (data not shown).
Further, we analyzed the functional effect of a nonsynonymous variant in SLC15A2. For in vitro functional
analysis, we first identified the variant genotypes of
rs2257212(L350F) in several human HCC cell lines and
found that Hep3B, PLC/PRF5, and SNU182 possessed
the C/C, C/T and T/T genotypes, respectively (Fig. 3A).
Consistent with the results of whole-genome analysis and
validation study, the T variant of rs2257212 in SLC15A2
showed a better response to sorafenib than the C variant.

Although the proliferation of cell lines was inhibited by
sorafenib treatment in a dose-dependent manner, SNU182
cells that harbored the T/T genotype displayed a better
response to sorafenib than the Hep3B cells that harbored
the C/C genotype (Fig. 3B). Additional western blot
analysis showed similar SLC15A2 expression levels in all
three cell lines (Fig. 3C), suggesting that structural, rather
than expressional, changes were the cause of the function
aberration.

DISCUSSION
Cancer biomarkers predicting outcomes of drug
treatment may be used to assess the probability that a
patient will benefit from a particular regimen of cancer
treatment. [14] Previous biomarker response studies have
evaluated the correlation between plasma angiogenesis
biomarkers, alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) level or vascular
permeability-perfusion of dynamic magnetic resonance
imaging, and responses to sorafenib in patients with
advanced HCC. [15–17] However, finding reliable
biomarkers is not an easy task and none of biomarkers
are clinically applicable to date. Recent approaches
focusing comprehensive genome analysis of extraordinary
response patients give rise to hope to identify genomic
alterations associate with drug response. Especially,
two studies identified genomics alterations related to
drug responses by analyzing “outlier” responder in lung
cancer patients. [18,  19] Here, we analyzed four good
responder of sorafenib and one of them is extreme outlier
with more than 55 months TTP although disease stage

One other patient also showed extraordinary response
to treatment with more than 38 months TTP. Our study
represents the first effort to identify sorafenib-response
variations and related genes through whole-genome
analysis of HCC patients.
This study was conducted in a phase II clinical trial
setting (named COTSUN), whereby the safety and efficacy
of concurrent TACE and sorafenib in patients with HCC
was evaluated. [20] TACE used as a locoregional therapy
may not directly affect the sorafenib response and, in the
present study, clinical characteristics were well collected
and balanced between the good and poor responder
cohorts; hence, we used blood samples from prospectively
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

collected specimens from the COTSUN trial. Using blood
samples from such a study is more convenient than using
tumor specimens in terms of availability of biomarkers.
A total of 1813 genomic variations with 100%
association for sorafenib responsiveness was discovered
in this study. Among these, six non-synonymous SNVs
were located in one sorafenib target gene (MUSK) and
three ADME genes (ABCB1, FMO3, and SLC15A2),
which could be considered as the member of main causes
for sorafenib drug responsiveness, possibly by influencing
protein function. To the best of our knowledge, this is the
first to report suggesting that MUSK, ABCB1, FMO3, and
SLC15A2 could be indicative for the response to sorafenib
in patients with HCC. Among the four candidate genes
16455

Oncotarget

that we identified in this study, ABCB1 is a member
of the superfamily of ATP-binding cassette (ABC)
transporters. Interestingly, for Asian nasopharyngeal
carcinoma patients, polymorphisms in the ABCG2
and ABCB1 genes could be predictive markers of drug
(irinotecan) activity. [21] The FMO3 gene is a type of
flavin-containing monooxygenase, which is a member of
an important class of drug-metabolizing enzymes. [22–24]
Unfortunetly, the results from our validation set of patients
and in vitro study did not confirm a meaningful association
between these genes (ABCB1, FMO3) and the response
to sorafenib (data not shown). These may be caused by
marginal number of patients or multiple variations could
be associated simultaneously which should be further
analyzed.
The most interesting result of this study was the
identification of non-synonymous single nucleotide
variations in SLC15A2 as an important predictor of the
response to sorafenib treatment in patients with HCC.
SLC15A2 belongs to the family of proton-coupled
peptide transporters that is responsible for the absorption
of small peptides, as well as beta-lactam antibiotics and
other drugs. [25] In our whole-genome analysis, the
variations in this gene were found to be associated with
sorafenib responsiveness and this result was validated in
the practice-based cohort of 174 patients who were treated
with sorafenib (Fig. 2; Table 1b). Patients with the T/T or
C/T genotype displayed a significantly longer PFS than
did patients with C/C genotypes (P = 0.003) maybe caused
by better response to sorafenib. In the in vitro study,
the suppression of HCC cell proliferation by sorafenib
displayed greater dominance in SNU182 (an HCC cell line
that was T/T homozygous for SLC15A2) compared to that
in Hep3B (an HCC cell line that was C/C homozygous
for SLC15A2). Taken together, our findings indicate that
the functional impact of coding variants in SLC15A2 may
affect sorafenib metabolism and responsiveness.
When we consider the results of in vitro assays in
which similar SLC15A2 expression levels were observed
in cell lines with different genotypes, the functional
mechanism of the SLC15A2 variants should be related
not to the change of expression level but to the structural
changes caused by these variants. Although in silico
analysis for three-dimensional structure prediction did not
display substantial differences between both genotypes
(data not shown), computational analysis (pubmed  id:
15980458, kinasephos.mbc.nctu.edu.tw) of posttranslational modifications revealed that protein generated
from genes with variant genotypes (identified in good
responders) may have more potential phosphorylation
sites than wild type (identified in poor responders),
as shown in Supplementary Table 10. The increased
number of phosphorylation sites of SLC15A2 may
delay the dephosphorylation of the protein, contributing
to the longer activation required for SLC15A2, such
that it could participate more in the mechanism of the
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

sorafenib reaction. Together, patients with variant types
of SLC15A2 may possess advantages in the effectiveness
and responsive to sorafenib treatment because of the
increased stability of the SLC15A2 protein which should
be involved in the transport of this drug.
The analysis of gene-to-gene connection using
the  Liver hepatocellular carcinoma data in c-BioPortal
(http://www.cbioportal.org/public-portal/) showed  the
association of SLC15A2 with cystic fibrosis
transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) via
PDZ domain containing 1 or 3 (PDZK1 or PDZD3;
Supplementary Fig. 1). CFTR, a well-established
member of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter
superfamily, transport various molecules across
extracellular and intracellular membranes. Polymorphisms
of CFTR are known to be associated with benefit for
clinical evaluation. [26, 27] Also, molecular alteration of
PDZK1 may be associated with metabolic syndrome and
drug-resistance phenotype in multiple myeloma. [28, 29]
Additionally, many members of solute carrier family
were revealed, especially the organic cation transporter
OCT/OCT novel (OCTN) family. SLC22A4 (OCTN1)
and SLC22A5 (OCTN2) were linked with SLC15A2 via
PDZK1 and/or PDZD3. Interestingly, recent study reported
that the polymorphisms of these genes are associated with
prolonged TTP in unresectable gastrointestinal stromal
tumors treated with imatinib therapy. [30] Taken together,
the results of this network analysis provide additional
evidence for the functional relevance of SLC15A2 in the
response to sorafenib treatment.
SLC15A2 may transport many clinical and
experimental therapeutic compounds, including betalactams, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors,
5-aminolevulinic acid, bestatin, and pro-drugs such as
Val-acyclovir and Val-ganciclovir. [31, 32] Previous
reports have shown that different haplotypes of these
variants exhibited markedly different Km values for
glycyl-sarcosine (Gly-Sar). [33] Moreover, these
variants revealed ethnic disparities for which Caucasian
(0.371–0.500) and European (0.465–0.492) possessed
lower frequencies  of  the T allele in than the Asian
population did (0.744–0.800) [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.
gov/projects/SNP/]. These disparate frequencies may
provide one possible explanation for the differential
responses to sorafenib treatment vis à vis ethnicity.
Although validation with the independent cohort of this
study displayed a predictive significance to SLC15A2
genetic variation, further prospective clinical studies are
needed to confirm the predictive and/or prognostic values
of SLC15A2 genetic variation in responses to sorafenib
treatment.
In conclusion, we discovered genomic variants
and their genes that should be associated with sorafenib
responses for patients with HCC which could be used
as biomarkers for predicting the effectiveness of drug
responses. This is also the first report showing a significant

influence of the SLC15A2 genotype on the response to
sorafenib in patients with HCC; our results suggest
that SLC15A2 is a novel gene involved in sorafenib
metabolism. Although further prospective validation
and functional studies are needed, our results provide
the initial clues for classifying patients with HCC by
predicting the outcome of sorafenib treatment and for
tailoring individualized therapy for these patients.

DNA concentration were determined using an Agilent
2100 BioAnalyzer (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA, USA)
and quantified using a SYBR green qPCR protocol
on a LightCycler 480 (Roche, Indianapolis, IN, USA)
according to Illumina’s library quantification protocol.
Paired-end sequencing (2 × 100 bp) was performed on an
Illumina HiSeq 2000 by using HiSeq Sequencing kits

Read alignment and variation detection

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Next, 90-bp paired-end sequence reads with ~300-bp
inserts were aligned to the hg19 human reference genome
(NCBI build 37) by using a BWA algorithm1 ver. 0.5.9.
Two mismatches were permitted in the 45-bp seed
sequence. SAMtools were used to remove PCR duplicates
of the sequence reads, which may have been generated
during the library construction process. The aligned
reads were realigned at putative insertion/deletion (indel)
positions by using the GATK IndelRealigner algorithm
to enhance mapping quality. [37] Base quality scores
were recalibrated using the GATK TableRecalibration
algorithm.

Patients and specimen collection
The whole genome of seven patients was used for
NGS analysis. Six patients were selected from a cohort
of 50 patients with HCC, who were enrolled in a phase
II study of concurrent transarterial chemoembolization
(TACE) and sorafenib treatment. [20] Another patient
was selected from a patient cohort displaying a longterm (>48 weeks) response to sorafenib treatment. [34]
HCC was diagnosed by histological examination or
on the basis of clinicoradiologic criteria based on the
guidelines of the Korean Liver Cancer Study Group and
the National Cancer Center (NCC), Republic of Korea.
[35] A validation cohort was derived from 408 patients
with HCC who had been treated with sorafenib for greater
than a 6-week period between June 2007 and March 2012
at the NCC. [36] Fifty-seven patients who were lost to
follow up or who discontinued sorafenib treatment due to
non-medical issues were excluded. Out of the 351 patients,
blood samples were obtained from 174 patients and were
subsequently used for genotyping (Supplementary Fig. 2).
This study was conducted in accordance with the
Declaration of Helsinki and International Conference on
Harmonization-Good Clinical Practice. The study protocol
was approved by the Institutional Review Board at the
National Cancer Center (Goyang, Republic of Korea). All
patients provided us with their written informed consent to
undertake the study.

SNP and small indel analysis
Putative SNVs were called and filtered using the
UnifiedGenotyper and VariantFiltration commands in
GATK. The options used for SNP calling were a minimum
of 5 to a maximum of 200 reads in terms of mapping depth
with a consensus quality of 20, and the prior likelihood for
heterozygosity value of 0.001. To obtain small indels, the
dINDEL mode of the GATK UnifiedGenotyper was used.

Validation of SNVs by using genome-wide SNP
chips and Sanger sequencing
SNP genotyping to confirm the NGS data was
performed using an Axiom genotyping solution with an
Axiom Genome-Wide ASI 1 Array Plate (Affymetrix,
Santa Clara, CA, USA) and a reagent kit according to the
manufacturer’s protocol. Total genomic DNA (200 ng)
was used and the resulting data in the form of a DAT file
was automatically saved as a CEL file. The CEL intensity
file was normalized, and genotype calling was performed
using Genotyping Console 4.1 (Affymetrix) with
Axiom GT1 algorithms according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. The cutoff value for data quality control
was a DISHQC ≥ 0.82 for hybridization and a QC call
rate ≥ 97%.
Twenty-six SNVs, including 15 coding variations,
were validated by conventional Sanger sequencing using
dye-terminator chemistry. The sequences were analyzed
using an automatic sequencer ABI 3730 (Applied
Biosystems, Carlsbad, CA, USA). The target regions were
amplified by PCR followed by direct sequencing or were
cloned into TA vectors. Details of the PCR and sequencing
primers are provided in Supplementary Table 11.

Nucleic acid preparation and whole-genome
sequencing
Genomic DNA was extracted from patient
leukocytes by a MagAttract DNA Blood Midi Kit (Qiagen,
Inc. Valencia, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer’s
protocol. The DNA quality was assessed using a Nanodrop
spectrometer (Nanodrop Technologies, Wilmington, DE,
USA). An absorbance 260/280 value greater than 1.7 was
accepted for further analysis. Five micrograms of genomic
DNA was sheared using a Covaris S series ultrasonicator
(Covaris, Woburn, MA, USA). The fragments of sheared
DNA were then end-repaired, A-tailed, ligated to pairend adapters (Pair End Library Preparation Kit, Illumina,
CA, USA), and amplified by PCR according to the
manufacturer’s protocol. The quality of the library and

instructions. For western blot analysis, 30 μg of each cell
lysates was resolved on 4–12% NuPage gel (Invitrogen)
and then transferred onto Immobilon (Millipore, Billerica,
MA, USA). Immunoblotting was performed using an antiSLC15A2 primary antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology,
Santa Cruz, CA, USA) and anti-β-actin (Abcam,
Cambridge, MA, USA). Protein bands were detected using
WestZol (iNtRon, Gyeonggi, Republic of Korea).

Each SNV was mapped onto the UCSC gene table
according to its genomic features such as coding region,
untranslated region (UTR), and introns. Non-synonymous
SNV information was extracted by comparing UCSC (http://
genome.ucsc.edu/) reference gene information. Pathway
analysis was performed for the genes annotated to harbor
significant mutations by using the Kyoto  Encyclopedia
of Genes and Genomes (KEGG; 32, http://www.genome.
jp/kegg/) and Biocarta (http://www.biocarta.com/).
For structural analyses of variations in SLC15A2, RefSeq
NM_001145998 was used. Three-dimensional structures
were generated using Phyre 2.0 (http://www.sbg.bio.ic.ac.
uk/phyre2/html/page.cgi?id=index).
Post-translational
modification was analyzed using KinasePhos (kinasephos.
mbc.nctu.edu.tw). Integrative analysis for SLC15A2 with
publicly available data and pathways was performed by the
cBioPortal website (www.cbioportal.org).

CONFLICTS OF INTEREST
No conflicts of interest were declared.

To validate the candidate SNPs, 174 patients with
HCC who had been treated with sorafenib were genotyped
using the MassARRAY system (Sequenom, San Diego,
CA, USA) as previously described.[38] Progression-free
survival (PFS) was assessed by the Kaplan-Meier method,
and the association between generic polymorphisms and
risk for progression was assessed by Cox proportional
hazard model with adjustment by stage of hepatocellular
carcinomas. Hazard ratios and their 95% confidence
intervals (95% CI) were computed. Data analyses were
performed using STATA version 12.0 (Stata Corp, College
Station, TX, USA)

Validation and functional analysis of SLC15A2
Hep3B, PLC/PRF5 and SNU182 cells derived
from human HCCs were obtained from the Korean
Cell Line Bank (KCLB; Seoul, Republic of Korea) and
cultured in RPMI-1640 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA,
USA) with 10% (v/v) FBS and 100 U/mL penicillinstreptomycin at 37°C in 5% CO2. Genomic DNA was
extracted from cells using a MagAttract DNA mini M48
kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
For analysis of the SLC15A2 genotypes, genomic
DNA was amplified by PCR using SLC15A2 primers,
forward:
(5′-GGGTCTTGGGTGTAAATGGA-3′),
reverse:
(5′-CACACTTGGAGACCAGACGA-3′),
and  sequenced  as described above. For the MTT
assay, cells were plated in 96-well plates at a density of
1 × 104 cells/well and treated with sorafenib for 48 h in
RPMI-1640 medium. Next, the number of viable cells
was  measured by performing MTT assay (Promega
Fitchburg, WI, USA) according to the manufacturer’s
