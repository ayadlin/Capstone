Abstract
The effects of incorporating a biomarker-based (personalized or precision)
selection strategy on drug development timelines for new oncology drugs merit
investigation. Here we accessed documents from the Food and Drug Administration
(FDA) database for anticancer agents approved between 09/1998 and 07/2014 to
compare drugs developed with and without a personalized strategy. Sixty-three
drugs were included (28 [44%] personalized and 35 [56%] non-personalized). No
differences in access to FDA-expedited programs were observed between personalized
and non-personalized drugs. A personalized approach for drug development was
associated with faster clinical development (Investigational New Drug [IND] to New
Drug Application [NDA] submission; median = 58.8 months [95% CI 53.8–81.8]
vs. 93.5 months [95% CI 73.9–112.9], P =.001), but a similar approval time (NDA
submission to approval; median=6.0 months [95% CI 5.5–8.4] vs. 6.1 months [95%
CI 5.9–8.3], P = .756) compared to a non-personalized strategy. In the multivariate
model, class of drug stratified by personalized status (targeted personalized vs.
targeted non-personalized vs. cytotoxic) was the only independent factor associated
with faster total time of clinical drug development (clinical plus approval phase,
median = 64.6 vs 87.1 vs. 112.7 months [cytotoxic], P = .038). Response rates (RR) in
early trials were positively correlated with RR in registration trials (r = 0.63, P = <.001),
and inversely associated with total time of drug development (r = −0.29, P = .049).
In conclusion, targeted agents were developed faster than cytotoxic agents. Shorter
times to approval were associated, in multivariate analysis, with a biomarker-based
clinical development strategy.

INTRODUCTION

of biomarkers and streamlining of clinical trials were
major priorities for medical product development [5].
Incorporating biomarkers for treatment selection in cancer
therapy holds the promise of enhancing efficacy of new
treatments and improving the success of drug approvals
[6]. Indeed, we previously showed that the incorporation
of a biomarker-driven rationale for drug development
(personalized/precision therapy strategy) was associated
with improvements in response rate, progression-free and
overall survival for FDA-approved anticancer agents [7].
Considering the fragmentation of classic tumor
types into small subgroups and the recognition of new
molecular targets of rare tumors to be included in new

Recent improvements in the understanding of cancer
biology have posed new challenges for drug development in
oncology. Traditional tumor histologies are being sliced into
small molecular subsets, which are differentiated from each
other based on specific targets driving tumor growth [1–3]. In
addition, newly described genomic alterations are explaining
the pathophysiology of rare tumors [4]. Consequently, new
agents aiming to target these specific alterations are emerging
and entering the drug development pathway.
The March 2006 Food and Drug Administration
(FDA) critical path report stressed that the development

trials, it is expected that only small numbers of patients
may be suitable for clinical trials using a biomarker-based
approach. Hence, concerns about screen failures for
biomarker-based trials and recruitment hurdles for more
rare subsets of cancer exist, and theoretically may impact
the length of the development process for these drugs
[8, 9]. Nonetheless, the advancement of crizotinib to
drug approval in only three years after reporting ALK
rearrangement as a target in lung cancer [10], and the
approval of ceritinib (a next generation ALK inhibitor)
after phase I testing [11] suggests that a personalized
approach is feasible and perhaps more efficient.
The FDA has developed special programs to improve
drug approval timelines (Supplementary Table  S1).
One of the aims of these programs is to incentivize
the development of agents designed to treat rare and
life-threatening diseases, including molecular subtypes
of advanced cancers. Both crizotinib and ceritinib were
granted access to FDA-expedited programs, including
accelerated approval. Nonetheless, a prior study failed
to demonstrate faster drug development with expedited
programs [12], questioning the promise of these policies.
To date, little is known about the effects of incorporating
a biomarker-based rationale for the development of new
oncology drugs upon the length of drug development and
the role of FDA programs in this new drug development
paradigm. Herein, we performed a comprehensive
analysis of the development process of FDA-approved
drugs for advanced cancer between 09/1998 and 07/2014.
We aimed to compare the timeline of drugs developed with
or without a biomarker-based strategy and the influence of
access to FDA expedited programs.

type of registration trial were not different between
personalized and non-personalized drugs (Table 1).

RESULTS

Personalized therapy was associated with faster
clinical development

Access to FDA special programs
In order to speed the development and availability
of new drugs to treat serious conditions, the FDA has
developed expedited programs, including the Priority
Review, Fast Track Designation, Accelerated Approval
and Breakthrough Therapy Designation. We evaluated
the access of oncology drugs to at least one of these
programs. Overall, of the 63 drugs included in our analysis
only four drugs (axitinib, bosutinib, pazopanib and
trametinib) had no access to at least one of these programs.
Forty-eight drugs (76%) were granted Priority Review;
47(75%) received Fast Track designation; and 22(35%),
Accelerated Approval. Breakthrough designation was
created in July 2012, and hence only three approved drugs
included in our database (ibrutinib, obinutuzumab, and
ceritinib) were granted this designation. We compared
the access to each of the FDA special programs between
drugs developed under a personalized rationale versus
non-personalized drugs (Table 1). No differences in access
to these programs were detected between both groups.
The Orphan Drug Designation Program was created
to offer special funding conditions for drugs intended to
treat rare diseases, usually affecting less than 200,000
Americans, or when drugs were not expected to recover
the costs of development. Overall 42 drugs (67%) received
orphan drugs status. There was a trend for personalized
drugs to received orphan drug designation more frequently
(79% vs. 57% for non-personalized, P = .107).

Search results and characteristics of drugs

Clinical and approval phase were calculated for
included drugs (Supplementary Table S2). Arsenic
trioxide and decitabine were included only on approval
phase analysis due to absence of IND information.
Median duration of clinical phase of development was
75.4 months (N = 61 drugs, 95% CI 67.2–94.8) and
median approval time was 6.0 months (N = 63 drugs,
95% CI 6.0–7.8). Total time of clinical development (IND
submission to NDA/BLA approval) took a median of
85.2 months (95% CI, 74.3–108.0). Drugs developed
with a personalized strategy were associated with a faster
clinical development phase (median =58.8 months [95% CI
53.9–81.8] vs. 93.5 months [95% CI 73.9–112.9] P = .001),
but a similar duration of approval phase (median = 6.0
months [95% CI 5.5–8.4] vs. 6.1 months [95% CI 5.9–8.3],
P = .756) when compared with non-personalized drugs,
respectively (Figure 2). We also analyzed the influence of
drug or registration trial characteristics upon approval times
(Table 2). Although inclusion in an FDA special program
(Fast Track or Accelerated Approval) was numerically

We initially identified 81 FDA-approved drugs for
adult cancer treatment indications and 63 drugs were
selected for further analysis after applying selection
criteria as described in the methods section (Figure  1).
Twenty-eight drugs (44%) were developed in a
personalized fashion and 35 (56%) in a non-personalized
manner according to first NDA obtained (Supplementary
Table S3). All personalized drugs were classified as
targeted agents, while 21 (60%) of the non-personalized
agents were targeted and 14 (40%) were classified as
cytotoxic (all cytotoxics were non-personalized). More
personalized drugs had the initiation of their clinical
development (IND submission) during the contemporary
period of time (2001–2010) compared to non-personalized
drugs (75% of personalized drugs were developed between
2001 and 2010 while 42% of nonpersonalized drugs were
developed in this time frame; P = .0186). All the remaining
characteristics, including tumor type, year of approval,
approved schedule (monotherapy vs. combination) and

Response rates (RR) in early trials and drug
approval time

associated with a shorter total time of development
when compared with drugs not granted these conditions
(decreases of 19.9 months and 6.4 months in median
approval time, respectively) this was not statistically
significant. Inclusion in a Priority review program was
associated with a faster approval phase (6 months [95%
CI 5.5–7.0] vs. 9.9 months [95% CI 9.7–11.5] for drugs
with no priority, P = <.001); the total time of clinical
development was shorter, albeit not statistically significant
median = 77.5 versus 95 months; P = .41 (Table 2).
In the multivariate analysis, the class of drug
(targeted vs. cytotoxic) stratified by the development of
a drug under a personalized therapy strategy remained
as the only independent factor associated with a faster
drug development timeline (median = 64.6 (personalized
targeted) vs 87.1 (targeted non-personalized) vs. 112.7
months (cytotoxic) (P = .038) (Table 2).

We investigated whether the RR in phase I trials of
FDA-approved agents was correlated with total time of
clinical development. RR in all tumors included in a phase I
was inversely correlated with total time of drug development
(r = −0.29, P = .049, Figure 3A). A similar correlation
was detected when analyzing only the RR in the tumor of
interest (which subsequently received FDA approval for
the drug), although not statistically significant (r = −0.25,
P = .08, Figure 3B). We further investigated the correlation
between RR in early trials and RR in the registration trial
for each drug. Both RR in all tumors (r = 0.631, P < .001,
Figure 3C) and RR in the tumor of interest (r = 0.547,
P < .001, Figure 3D) were found to positively correlate with
RR in the respective registration trial of the drug.

DISCUSSION

showed that drugs developed under a biomarker-based (also
known as personalized or precision oncology) strategy
were associated with a significantly shorter clinical phase
of development (median = 58.8 months vs. 93.5 months for
non-personalized drugs, P = .001). Although FDA special
programs hold the promise to speed the development

One of the greatest challenges in oncology is to
deliver more efficient and safer drugs in a shorter time frame

program, the strategy for the development of a cancer drug
was still the most important factor to influence this process.
Our multivariate analysis revealed that targeted agents were
developed significantly faster when there was a biomarkerbased selection approach than when targeted agents were
given to unselected patients or as compared to cytotoxic
agents (P = .038).
	 A previous study by DiMasi and Grabowski
[13] reported that oncology drugs have more access
to FDA special programs than non-oncology drugs.
Consequently, median approval time (NDA/BLA
submission to final approval) was shorter for oncology
drugs (1.0 vs. 1.3 years). However, the authors described
a longer clinical phase of development for these drugs,
compared to non-oncology agents (7.8 vs. 6.3 years).
The current oncology drug development model is
characterized by high attrition rates and a substantial
lag time between different steps [8, 13] due to multiple
factors, including regulatory burden and difficulty with
designing definitive trials [14]. In addition, drugs have
been traditionally developed for cancer populations
selected solely by histology. In order to obtain regulatory
approval, large trials were designed to show a small, but
statistical significant clinical benefit in large groups [15].
As a consequence, longer clinical development, higher
costs, and a high failure rate of oncology drugs have led

to doubts regarding the sustainability of this approach for
drug development [8, 9].
Recently, efforts were made to improve the drug
development model and to reduce the failure rate of
oncology drugs, as well as to shorten the time for
drug development [5]. The recognition of molecular
abnormalities that characterize certain tumor types led
to the development of more specific targeted agents,
aiming to be more efficient in a biomarker-positive
population [16]. Consequently, incorporation of a
biomarker-driven strategy has been encouraged by some
regulatory agencies [1, 5]. Not surprisingly, our results
demonstrated a reasonable number of personalized drugs
(44%) among anticancer agents approved by the FDA
since 1998. In addition, over the more recent period of
approvals (from 2007 to 2014), drugs developed with a
biomarker-based rationale outnumbered those without
such a rationale (20 vs. 19 drugs).
It is well recognized that biomarker development
is also challenging. Inter and intratumoral heterogeneity
can compromise the widespread use of genetic and protein
biomarkers; technical challenges include the need for
analytical validation of tests and also finding samples
that are more feasible to be used; and clinical validation
of a predictive test often needs prospective studies [17].
Several practical strategies to facilitate biomarker

development have been proposed, including optimization
of pre-clinical models, early standardization of tests
and close mirroring of clinical drug development with
biomarker development [18]. This early introduction
of biomarker development during a drug development
timeline can improve the success, including a faster and
more efficient model.
The FDA has also expanded its expedited programs
to facilitate drug development. In agreement with
previous data [13], we report a high rate of access to
Priority Review (76%), Fast Track Designation (75%) and
Accelerated Approval (35%) for oncology drugs included
in our database. Although we could not detect differences
in access to these programs between personalized and
non-personalized drugs, a trend for receiving more orphan
drug status (79% vs. 57%, P = .107) was characteristic
of personalized drugs. We could not discern statistically
significant differences in time to approval for drugs that
had access to any one of the special FDA programs,
though each had a numerically shorter time to approval
(Table 2). Our finding that even accelerated approval was
not associated with a shorter development time mirrors the
findings from a prior study [12]. It is possible that drugs
chosen for accelerated approval pathway target a more
restricted cancer population. Thus, slow trial accrual may
counterbalance the benefit of approval based on surrogate
endpoints upon development timeline. Further, only four

drugs had no access to any special program; therefore
determining the effect of lack of access to special
programs was not possible. Of note, Priority Review
Status did shorten the time from NDA/BLA submission
to final approval (median = 9.9 to 6.0 months; P < .001);
overall median time from IND submission to approval
was 77.5 versus 95 months; P = .27. It is important to
note that only three drugs (ibrutinib, obinutuzumab and
ceritinib –all personalized) were approved under the
newly minted Breakthrough Designation, and, therefore,
more experience with this mechanism is needed to
determine its impact.
Targeted drugs that were developed for a molecularly
selected cancer population had some of the shortest clinical
development timelines. Examples are imatinib for chronic
myelogenous leukemia (CML; Bcr/Abl translocation)
(total clinical phase time = 36 months), ceritinib for
ALK-positive non-small cell lung cancer (total clinical
phase time = 42.7 months; approved after Phase I) and
dabrafenib for BRAF-positive melanoma (total clinical
development time = 47.1 months). All these drugs had
access to at least one FDA special program. Aiming to
obtain a large difference in a small patient group was
an important driver of their success. It is possible that
a higher clinical activity of biomarker driven drugs, as
previously demonstrated [7, 19, 20], could also explain
their faster clinical development. It is also interesting to

note that we could not detect differences in total approval
time if the drug approval was based on a randomized or
non-randomized trial (Table 2). Approving drugs based on
non-randomized trials was previously also demonstrated
to be safe [21].
Our analysis of drug development timelines was
restricted to the FDA database. It would be necessary
to determine if these results could be extrapolated to
other regulatory agencies (such as European Medicines
Agency and Health Canada), which could face similar
regulatory timelines [22]. The requirements for the
development process of molecularly-oriented treatments
are not well established for many agencies, and the
co-development of companion diagnostic tests and access

to expedited programs is a paradigm that is still evolving
[23, 24]. A global effort to harmonize the guidelines for
the development of personalized therapies may assist
international trials that could be needed for ultra-rare
populations.
Not surprisingly, we also showed that a higher
response rate in early trials correlated with shorter drug
development times. Moreover, responses in early phase
trials were positively correlated to responses in registration
trials. Since we did not include agents that failed to obtain
FDA approval, we cannot establish whether or not early
responses are a surrogate of drug success. Even so,
activity appears to be an important endpoint for phase I
trials. Indeed, high activity in dose expansions of phase I

approved (B) and total time of drug development (IND submission to NDA/BLA approval) in months. Total time of

development was inversely associated with response rate. Reported response rates in phase I trials in all tumors (C) and tumors in which
the drugs were eventually approved (D) and response rates in registration trials of the same drug. Phase I trials were matched to registration
trials as described in methods section and previously published. [31].

Data extraction

trials led to easier access to FDA expedited programs and
notably shorter approval times for crizotinib and ceritinib.
[11, 25] Both ceritinib (ALK inhibitor) and more recently
pembrolizumab (anti-PD-1) have been approved by the
FDA after Phase I testing [11, 26].
The approval of trastuzumab for Her-2 positive,
advanced breast cancer was an important factor in
triggering an era of biomarker-guided drug development.
Advances in molecular diagnostic and research techniques
are leading to more widespread acceptance of the concept
of precision oncology. Herein, we demonstrate that the
strategies that underlie precision oncology can also
hasten the clinical phase of drug development and time to
approval of new agents.

Data extraction was conducted independently by two
investigators (DFJ and MS) and any discrepancies were
resolved by consensus in frequent meetings in the presence
of the principal investigator (RK). As for drug development
information, we obtained data of IND submission,
first new drug application (NDA) or biologic license
application (BLA) submission and approval, and access
to FDA expedited programs (Supplementary Table S2).
We considered US clinical phase as the time between
first IND submission and NDA/BLA submission, and
approval phase as the time of first NDA/BLA submission
to approval [13]. Total clinical development time was
considered as the sum of clinical and approval phases.
From the clinical trials, we obtained information
about trial characteristics and efficacy, described as
response rates (RRs). Although responses are not the
main outcome considered by the FDA for drug approval,
they are available from phase I trials and could indicate
early activity [32]. Responses were recorded according
to the response criteria adopted in the trial: for solid
tumors, partial and complete responses as per Response
Evaluation in Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST) [33] or
World Health Organization Criteria (WHO) [34]; for
chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), major cytogenetic
responses; for multiple myeloma (MM), partial and
complete responses; for acute myelogenous leukemia
(AML), complete responses; and for lymphomas, partial
and complete responses by WHO criteria. We captured
responses in phase I trials for all cancer patients and for
patients with the cancer type that subsequently led to FDA
approval (tumor of interest). Lack of standardization for
reporting RR in phase I trials precluded the analysis of
dose levels upon responses.
For the purpose of our analysis, personalized
therapy, biomarker-based strategy, and precision oncology
were used interchangeably. We considered a therapy as
“personalized” when it met one of the following criteria:
a. Cognate biomarker used to select patients for
treatment OR
b. No cognate biomarker used, but at least 50% of
patients are known to harbor a cognate biomarker.
We classified as targeted, agents designed to
specifically impact signals in the cancer cell that are
abnormal or are differentially expressed compared to those
in normal elements.

Materials and Methods
Search strategy
To analyze various aspects of drug development
in oncology after the introduction of biomarker-based
therapies, we reviewed agents newly approved for the
treatment of advanced cancer by the FDA between
September 25th 1998 (FDA approval of trastuzumab
for metastatic Her2 positive breast cancer) and July
3rd, 2014. New molecular entities’ (NMEs) approvals,
package inserts and review documents were obtained
for analysis through the FDA website [27]. When
first investigational new drug (IND) application
information was not fully available in the FDA
documents, we also consulted the Federal Register
website for regulatory review process documents
related to patent restoration [28]. Information about
drug approvals and access to FDA expedited programs
were also compared with contemporary literature [29].
Information about registration trials was obtained
from the FDA original package inserts and original
publications were obtained through MEDLINE or ASCO
meetings’ website [30] (if the clinical trial was not yet
published). We concomitantly searched MEDLINE
for phase I trials for each of the agents selected from
the FDA database analysis. These trials were matched
with registration trials of the respective agent if they
evaluated a non-pediatric cancer patients and explored
either monotherapy (as FDA-approved) or the same
combination and schedule as described in the FDA
package insert; in addition, the phase I trial should
have started before the later clinical trial and included
similar patient populations of solid versus hematologic
malignancies [31]. We excluded agents approved
for pediatric cancer, supportive care, loco-regional
treatment, hormonal therapies, vaccines and agents
that already had been approved before search period or
discontinued in the US market.

Statistical analysis
Assessment of independent samples was done using
a Wilcoxon rank-sum test. The multiple linear regression
model for approval time contained only the independent
variables that were significant in the univariate analysis.

test. The correlations between response rate and approval
time were estimated using Spearman rank correlation
