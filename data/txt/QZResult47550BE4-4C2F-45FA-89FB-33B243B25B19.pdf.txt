ABSTRACT:

NFkB transcription factors play a key role in the survival and proliferation of many
kinds of B-cell tumors, including multiple myeloma (MM). It was shown that NFkB
activation in MM tumors results mainly from extrinsic signaling by APRIL and BAFF
ligands that stimulate receptors on normal plasma cells as well as on pre-malignant
monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) and MM tumors.
However, the mutations that occur during MM progression and that constitutively
activate NFkB would be expected to decrease dependence of tumor cells on the bone
marrow microenvironment. These mutations can activate the classical or alternative
NFkB pathways selectively, but usually both pathways are activated in MM. Significantly,
activation of either NFkB pathway leads to a similar response of MM cell lines. This
frequent activation of the alternative pathway distinguishes MM from other B-cell
tumors, which more frequently have mutations that are predicted to activate only the
classical NFkB pathway. Given the strong dependence of MGUS and MM tumors on NFkB
pathway activation, inhibition by a combination of targeting extrinsic signaling plus
both NFkB pathways appears to be an attractive therapeutic approach in MM tumors.

INTRODUCTION

MM, as defined by specific genetic and cytogenetic aberrations [2-4]. Early events distinguish two major categories of tumors that have a similar prevalence: hyperdiploid
and non-hyperdiploid [5, 6]. Hyperdiploid tumors rarely
have primary IgH translocations but usually have multiple
trisomies involving eight odd-numbered chromosomes.
By contrast, most non-hyperdiploid tumors have primary
IgH translocations that usually occur as a result of errors
in somatic hypermutation and IgH switch recombination
in germinal center B-lymphocytes. The dysregulation of a
Cyclin D gene is the unifying – perhaps initiating – event
that is common to all MGUS and MM tumors. Significantly, MM tumors that are hyperdiploid or have a t(11;14)
(CYCLIN D1) translocation have a better prognosis than

Multiple myeloma (MM) is a post-germinal center
tumor that has undergone extensive somatic hypermutation, antigen selection, and productive IgH switch recombination prior to homing to the bone marrow as a plasmablast
that displays a long-lived plasma cell (PC) phenotype in
this microenvironment. MM usually is preceded by nonIgM monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS), a premalignant tumor that progresses to
MM at an average rate of about 1% per year [1]. Both
MGUS and MM, until terminal stages, are located mainly
in the bone marrow.
There are several molecular subtypes of MGUS and

tumors that have t(4;14)(MMSET&FGFR3) or MAF translocations.
The molecular basis for the progression of MGUS to
MM is not understood. However, progression events that
can occur in all of the different molecular subtypes of MM
include: additional cytogenetic and epigenetic abnormalities, activating mutations of N- and K-RAS, AKT pathway
mutations, NFkB pathway mutations, p53 deletion or mutation, RB1 or p18CDKN2c inactivation, and MYC rearrangements[2, 6-10].
In addition to an accumulation of genetic aberrations
in MM cells, disease progression is mediated by evolving
crosstalk between different cell types within the BM. MM
cells can survive and proliferate in the BM microenvironment through their interactions with bone marrow stromal
cells (BMSC) and extracellular matrix. By binding MM
cells to BMSCs, adhesion molecules can activate intracellular signaling cascades in MM cells, and can increase
stromal cell secretion of cytokines involved in tumor cell
proliferation [11]. For example, IL6 production by BMSCs
is induced by MM cells [12]. Some of the growth and
survival factors produced in the BM microenvironment
include: IL6, IGF, HGF, VEGF, osteopontin, SDF1, B cell–
activating factor (BAFF), A proliferation-inducing ligand
(APRIL). Moreover, adhesion of MM cells to BMSCs
induces the release of different osteoclast activating factors
by stromal and myeloma cells [13]. The crosstalk among
the MM cells, osteoclasts, and stromal cells not only stimulates MM cell survival and growth, but also results in bone
destruction by osteoclasts [14, 15].
Of all the different signaling pathways activated in MM
cells by external stimulation, the NFkB pathway may be
one of the most important. Some factors that are produced
by BM cells, e.g., VEGF and IGF1, can indirectly activate
the NFkB pathway in PC and MM cells [11, 16]. More
importantly, it has been shown that BAFF and APRIL,
which can directly activate the NFkB pathway, are two of
the main survival factors for healthy PCs and MM cells
[17, 18]. They share two receptors, TACI and BCMA,
which activate the classical NFkB pathway, but BAFF also
can activate the alternative pathway through the BAFF-R
receptor.
Since myeloma tumors as well as many other B-cell
neoplasms use NFkB to achieve survival, proliferation and
resistance to anticancer drugs, inhibition of NFkB activation appears to be a very promising option for anti-cancer
therapies.

20]. There are two general pathways of activation – classical (or canonical) and alternative (Figure 1). Many different stimuli, including external signaling through B cell
receptors (BCR) and some tumor necrosis factor receptors
(TNFR), activate the classical NFkB pathway [19]. Following stimulation through TNFR-associated factors (TRAF5,
TRAF2), RIP and TAK1, IKKβ (which is part of an IKKαIKKβ-IKKγ complex) is activated and phosphorylates the
inhibitory subunits IkBα, IkBβ, and IkBε, leading to their
proteasomal degradation. As a result, NFkB homodimers
and heterodimers, comprised mainly of RelA, RelC, and
p50, accumulate in the nucleus. Classical RelA:p50 heterodimers are predominantly regulated by IkBα. Several
negative regulators, such as A20 (also known as TNFAIP3)
and CYLD, are also important for the classical NFkB
pathway. This pathway plays a major role in the control
of immune response and inflammation, and is required to
enhance the survival and proliferation of cells.
In the alternative pathway, NIK (NFkB-inducing kinase)
activates IKKα, which phosphorylates NFKB2. This results
in proteasomal removal of an inhibitory C-terminal IkBδ
domain, generating the p52 subunit, which leads to accumulation of p52/RelB heterodimers in the nucleus. The
alternative NFkB pathway, which is important in lymphoid
development and B-cell maturation [21], is stimulated by a
more restricted set of cytokines, including CD40L, LTαβ,
BAFF, RANKL (receptor activator of NFkB ligand), and
TWEAK (TNF-related weak inducer of apoptosis) [22-24].
Several recent reports indicate that the alternative NFkB
signaling is regulated mainly through the control of NIK
turnover, with TRAF3, TRAF2 and cIAP1/2 critically
involved in this process [25-28].
Importance of NFkB pathway for mature B-cells and
PC, and their tumors
To investigate mechanisms of activation of NFkB
in MM cells we created an NFkB index as a measure of
NFkB activity [29]. We used the average RNA expression
of eleven genes (nine of which are well known NFkB targets), that were down-regulated in MM cell lines (MMCLs)
treated with MLN120b (IKKβ inhibitor) or transfected with
antiNIK shRNA. The same 11 genes were up-regulated in
MMCL transfected with IKKβ or NIK genes that activate,
respectively, the classical and alternative NFkB pathways
[30].
As we recently showed [29] (Fig.3D), various stages of
normal human B cell differentiation have a different NFkB
index. With the exception of germinal center B cells, the
NFkB index was higher for mature B cells and B cells at
later developmental stages compared to immature B cells
and B cells at earlier developmental stages. The highest
NFkB index was found in PC, consistent with their dependence on extrinsic BM signals that increase NFkB activity

NFkB transcription factors and their signaling pathways
The NFkB family of transcription factors is composed
of NFKB1 (p50 and its precursor p105), NFKB2 (p52
and its precursor p100), RelA (p65), RelB and c-Rel [19,

[31]. In addition, the level of NFkB activity was shown to
be at a similarly high level in healthy and transformed PC,
although MM tumors with mutations in the NFkB pathway
had a somewhat higher NFKB index. In contrast, although
MMCLs with mutations in the NFkB pathway also had a
high NFKB index, MMCLs without apparent mutations in
the NFkB pathway had a substantially lower NFkB index
(Fig. 2) [29]. Together, these data suggest that NFkB activation results mainly from extrinsic TNFR signaling in
healthy PC, and most MGUS and MM tumors. Mutations
in the NFkB pathway in MM tumors presumably result in
less dependence on – and in some cases independence from
- extrinsic signals from the BM microenvironment.
Previously, it was shown that TACI-Fc, which acts as an
antagonist to BAFF and APRIL by binding these factors and
preventing them from interacting with TACI, BMCA, and
BAFF.R receptors, causes a marked decrease in the number
of normal murine BMPC. Strong dependence of MM
cells on external activation of NFkB has also been demonstrated in experiments with Atacicept (formerly TACI-Ig),
a recombinant fusion protein containing the extracellular,
ligand-binding portion of the receptor TACI and the modified Fc portion of human IgG1. Inhibition of BAFF and
APRIL using Atacicept in some MMCLs co-cultured with
supporting osteoclasts or dendritic cells resulted in reduced
myeloma cell growth and diminished clonogenic potential
[32-34]. In addition, the first clinical study of Atacicept in
MM patience demonstrated that about half of patients who
completed initial treatment were progression-free after
therapy [35].
It is notable that NFkB is important also in other kinds
of normal mature B cells (perhaps with the exception of germinal center B cells), and especially in several B cell neoplasms. For instance, gene expression profiling separated
Diffuse Large B Cell Lymphoma (DLBCL) into three gene
expression subgroups: Germinal Center B cell-like (GCB),
Primary Mediastinal B cell Lymphoma (PMBL) and Activated B Cell-like (ABC) [36-38]. These DLBCL subgroups
arise from different stages of normal B cell differentiation.
One significant difference among the DLBCL subgroups
is the constitutive activity of the NF-κB pathway in ABC
and PMBL but not GCB DLBCL, which is associated with
a better outcome. It was found, that ABC and PMBL cells
have high expression of known NFkB target genes when
compared with GCB DLBCLs. Moreover, inhibition of the
NFkB pathway using a dominant active form of IκBα, or a
dominant negative form of the IKKβ subunit, was toxic to
ABC DLBCL cell lines but not to GCB DLBCL cell lines
[36].

of healthy mature B-cells, and also is important in some
kinds of B-cell tumors derived from mature B-cells, it is
not surprising that mutations in the NFkB pathway are
common in many kinds of B-cell neoplasms. Various kinds
of NFkB pathway mutations have been found in Hodgkin's
lymphoma (HL) and non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (NHL),
including DLBCL, mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue
lymphoma (MALT.L), follicular lymphoma (FL), and
Waldenstrom’s Macroglobulinemia (WM).
The BCR pathway is required for cell survival in normal
B cells, and includes activation of the classical NFkB pathway. Classic HL, which is characterized by the presence
of Hodgkin and Reed-Sternberg cells, are derived from the
clonal expansion of a germinal centre B cell but often do
not express the BCR and other B-cell markers [39]. Perhaps, the high prevalence of NFkB abnormalities in HL is
able to compensate for survival mechanisms mediated in
the absence of a BCR. In any case, in HL [40] and other B
cell tumors several kinds of abnormalities have been found
in the protein complex that transduces NFkB activating
signals from the BCR. MALT1 was initially identified as
an oncogenic protein commonly expressed in a subset of
MALT.L. Early studies revealed that MALT1 binds to the
BCL10 protein [41]. Further experimental evidence suggested that BCL10 and MALT1 cooperate with Carma1
(CARD11) [42] to form a trimeric protein complex (CBM),
which is implicated in NFkB activation. This CBM complex can be recruited to the IKK complex, which leads to
IKKβ phosphorylation [43]. Moreover, MALT1 was found
to cleave human A20 (also called TNFAIP3) at Arg439,
generating two protein fragments that did not inhibit NFkB
activation [44]. Three recurrent translocations have been
identified in MALT.L: the t(11;18)(q21;q21) cIAP-MALT1
translocation, which is the most common; but also the
t(1;14)(p22;q32) and t(14;18)(q32;q21) translocations,
which place the Ig heavy chain enhancer upstream of the
BCL10 and MALT1 genes, respectively, causing de-regulated expression of each protein (reviewed in [45]). Patients
with the cIAP2–MALT1 translocation have a poorer clinical
prognosis than patients with other translocations [46-48].
This may be explained by results showing that cIAP2–
MALT1 fusions can more strongly activate the NFkB pathway in comparison to overexpression of either BCL10 or
MALT1. Significantly, RNA interference screens have
demonstrated that CARD11, BCL10 and MALT1, molecules are essential for NFkB activation and cell survival
in ABC DLBCL cell lines [49]. Furthermore, it recently
was shown that about 10% of ABC DLBCL have a mutant
form of the CARD11 BCR signaling adaptor, and that 18%
have mutated the first ITAM tyrosine of CD79B (a proximal BCR subunit) [50].
One of the most frequent abnormalities, which were
found in a wide range of B-cell neoplasms, is a loss of
function of the A20 protein, a key negative regulator of the

NFkB classical pathway. This negative regulator can be
inactivated by somatic mutations or deletions in MALT.L
(21.8%), HL of nodular sclerosis histology (33-44%),
ABC DLBCL (24.3%), PMBL-DLBCL (36%) and, to a
lesser extent, in FL, GCB DLBCL and WM [51-54]. It was
shown, that in A20-deficient cells, re-expression of A20
leads to suppression of cell growth and NFkB activity [52].
Several other genetic alterations that contribute to activation of NFkB have been described. Inactivating mutations or deletions of IkBα have been identified in 10 %
of HL [39, 55]. Furthermore, 20% of ABC DLBCL and a
smaller fraction of GCB DLBCL carry somatic mutations
in TRAF2, TRAF5, TAK1 and RANK genes [54]. Amplification of Rel on chromosome 2p14-15 has been detected in
HL (26%) and in a smaller proportion of PMBL-DLBCL,
FL and MALT.L [56, 57]. This mutation is associated with
high levels of nuclear c-Rel. Curiously, this amplification
occurs also in 16% of GCB DLBCLs, but cells with this
abnormality had largely cytoplasmic c-Rel [58] and do not
express NFkB target genes at higher levels than those with
a wild type c-Rel copy number [38].
Most genetic abnormalities in B-cell tumors result in
activation of the classical NFkB pathway (Fig. 1A), with
only two examples of mutations that would be predicted to
activate the alternative NFkB pathway. The first example is
structural alterations affecting the 3’ portion of the NFKB2
gene, which were found in some B-cell lymphoma [59,

60]. Although this is expected to specifically activate the
alternative pathway, the mutations eliminate the carboxyterminal sequences, which inactivate the IkBδ activity that
can be a significant inhibitor of the classical pathway. The
second example is biallelic inactivation of the TRAF3 gene
in 5% of WM [53], but also in B-cell NHL and chronic lymphocytic leukemia that have deletion del(14)(q24.1q32.33)
[61]. As described below, inactivation of TRAF3 results in
increased levels of NIK protein that activates the alternative NFkB pathway, but sometimes can also activate the
classical NFkB pathway. It remains to be determined if
activation of the classical NFkB pathway is the uniquely
important biological consequence of the NFkB pathway
mutations that have been found in B-cell tumors.
Mutations can activate either but usually both NFkB
pathways in MM
Mutations in eleven genes involved in regulation of the
NFkB pathway have been identified in 42% of MMCL, and
at least 17% of MM tumors (Fig. 1B) [29, 62]. Translocations or amplification was found to increase transcription
of five positive regulators, which include NIK and NFKB1
plus three TNFR (CD40, TACI, LTBR). In addition, there
was one example of a translocation that deleted a negative
regulatory region from NIK so that it was less susceptible
to proteasomal degradation. In contrast, deletions – often

B-cell tumors are indicated with dark green and red colors. Components within green boxes are TNFR that are over-expressed in
MMCL; but the significance of these two abnormalities remains to be clarified, i.e., FR4 MMCL has relatively low NFkB activity despite
increased expression of LTBR [30]; it is not confirmed that markedly increased TRAMP expression is the cause of increased NFkB
activity in the KMS-12BM and KMS-12PE MMCL.

unclear why TRAF3 mutations are predominant, but might
be explained – at least in part - by the presence of TRAF3
on chr14, one of the chromosomes lost most frequently
in MM, and particularly in non-hyperdiploid tumors [6].
By contrast, TRAF2 is located on chromosome 9, which
is usually trisomic in hyperdiploid tumors, and only infrequently become monosomic. In addition, inactivation of
TRAF2 might decrease activation of the classical pathway.
Previously, several groups have shown that regulation
of NIK protein levels is mediated by a TRAF2/TRAF3
interaction, which recruits a TRAF2-cIAP1/2 ubiquitin
ligase complex to a TRAF3-NIK complex and leads to the
cIAP1/2- mediated K48 ubiquitination of NIK that marks
it for rapid proteasomal degradation [26, 27]. The activation of some TNFR (e.g., CD40 and BAFFR) results in an
increased cIAP1/2-mediated K48 ubiquitination of TRAF3
that marks it for rapid proteasomal degradation, resulting
in stabilization and activation of NIK that is not recruited
to the TRAF2-cIAP1/2 complex. Mutations that inactivate
TRAF3, TRAF2 and cIAP1/2 result in stabilization and
activation of NIK, and consequent NFKB2 processing. The
level of NIK protein is much higher in MMCLs that have
inactivated either TRAF2 or cIAP1/2 than in MMCLs that
have inactivated TRAF3. We showed that TRAF3 is not
absolutely required for binding of TRAF2-cIAP1/2 to NIK
in MMCL, even though the cIAP1/2-mediated degradation
of NIK is substantially decreased in the absence of TRAF3.
We also demonstrated the binding of TRAF2 to NIK in
TRAF3 null MMCL, in contrast to the inability of others
to identify an interaction of TRAF2 and NIK in other kinds
of cells. It remains to be determined if some other protein
is required for interaction of TRAF2 with NIK in TRAF3
deficient MMCLs. One possibility could be TNAP, a protein that can physically interact with NIK, TRAF2, and

homozygous – and mutations, were shown to inactivate
five negative regulators of the classical (CYLD) or alternative (cIAP1&2, TRAF2, TRAF3, and NFKB2) NFkB pathways [30]. Only two of these eleven genes – NFKB2 and
TRAF3 – were found to have similar mutations or to be
inactivated in both MM and B-cell tumors (Fig. 1A and
above). In addition, different kinds of TRAF2 abnormalities
have been found in MM versus B-cell tumors. Some MM
tumors and MMCL have homozygous deletion of TRAF2,
which results in increased levels of NIK, the critical kinase
that activates the alternative NFkB pathway. By contrast,
Compagno [54] described missense mutations of TRAF2
that were associated with enhanced activation of the classical NFkB pathway in B-cell lymphoma. These results
are in accord with the idea that TRAF2 has two different
functions – activation of the classical NFkB pathway (Fig.
1A) and inactivation of the alternative NFkB pathway (Fig.
1B). One possible explanation for the different pattern of
mutations in MM and B-cell tumors is the absence in PC
and MM cells of a functional BCR that is a key target for
NFkB pathway mutations in B-cell tumors.
Based on studies with MMCLs, some of the NFkB
mutations in MM tumors and MMCLs activate mainly the
classical pathway (CYLD, NFKB1, TACI), and one mainly
the alternative pathway (NFKB2), but most activate the
alternative and to a lesser extent the classical pathway
(cIAP1/2, NIK, TRAF2, TRAF3, CD40) (Fig.2B). All abnormalities in this last group result in increased levels of NIK
protein, e.g., cIAP1/2, TRAF3 and TRAF2 are involved
in a complex that negatively regulates NIK protein stability. This latter group of mutations are overrepresented, a
result that is determined by the substantial prevalence of
TRAF3 mutations in both MMCLs (one third of mutations)
and MM tumors (>50% of mutations) [29, 30, 62]. It is

TRAF3, and that can suppress NIK kinase activity [63].
As indicated above high levels of NIK protein are able to
activate not only the alternative pathway, but also the classical pathway in most MM cell lines. Others have shown
that physiological or pathological increases in NIK expression in different type of cells can activate both pathways
by a NIK and IKKα dependent mechanism [64]. However,
it is not clear why there is a more severe defect in immune
function in mice defective for NIK compared to mice that
homozygously express kinase defective IKKα, and an even
lesser effect in mice that are null for NFKB2 [65]. It also
is surprising that a substantial IKKα shRNA knockdown
has no apparent effect on NFkB activity of either pathway
unless the residual levels of IKKα are sufficient for the
NFkB activity observed in the MMCL [29, 66].
Selective activation or inactivation of either the classical or the alternative NFkB pathway in many MMCLs,
respectively, increases or decreases the expression of all
eleven genes that were used to generate an 11-gene NFkB
index [29]. In addition, the long term effects of selective
activation of either the alternative or the classical NFkB
pathway demonstrated virtual identical changes in the
gene expression pattern and gene set enrichment analysis
(GSEA) on KEGG pathways in one MMCL, and similar albeit non-identical changes in a second MMCL [30].
The strong overlap of expression changes for activation of
either NFkB pathway in MMCLs may explain why either
pathway can be selectively activated by mutations in MM
tumors. By contrast, the preponderance of mutations that
selectively activate the classical NFkB pathway in B-cell
tumors might be due to different biological effects for
activation of the classical vs alternative NFkB pathway in
these tumors.

Since the prevalence of NFkB mutations seems to be
substantially higher in MMCLs compared to MM tumors,
it seems possible that NFkB mutations often represent
relatively late progression events, a conclusion that is supported by the heterogeneity of these mutations in some
MM tumors [62]. Therefore, although NFkB activation in
MM tumors results mainly from extrinsic signaling (Fig.
2 and above), the mutations that occur during progression
and that constitutively activate NFkB would be expected to
decrease dependence of tumor cells on the BM microenvironment (Fig.3).
The main features of NFkB activation in MM cells
appear to be a strong dependence on microenvironment
signals and a similar response to activation of either NFkB
pathway. Given the apparent importance of NFkB activation for the survival of the MM tumor cells, inhibition of
NFkB may be an attractive therapeutic approach.
NFkB inhibitors in MM therapy
The outcome of multiple myeloma has substantially
improved over the past decade, mainly due to recently
approved drugs, such as bortezomib, thalidomide and
lenalidomide. Increasing knowledge of the important role
of the NFkB pathway in MM suggests the potential for the
development of novel drugs that target this pathway.
Proteasome inhibitors, such as bortezomib or NPI0052, have excellent clinical activity in patients with multiple myeloma [67]. In MM, bortezomib modifies c-FLIP
levels, stabilizes pro-apoptotic members of the BCL-2
family, increases caspase activity, and inhibits the two
major pathways leading to NFkB activation [68, 69]. It
was shown that patients having MM tumors with a strong

64

www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget/

NFkB signature or with low level of TRAF3 RNA have
a better response to bortezomib [62, 70]. Moreover, MM
cells with low levels of TRAF3 showed resistant to dexamethasone treatment [62]. This might be explained, at
least partially, by the mechanism that controls NIK protein levels. Treatment of cells with dexamethasone induces
expression of IkBα, which inhibits the classical pathway,
and also cIAP, which might block activity of the alternative NFkB pathway. However, abnormalities of TRAF2,
TRAF3 or cIAP1/2, and also the downstream mutation of
NFKB2 might minimize the effect of increased cIAP1/2
and decrease the effectiveness of dexamethasone. Hence,
dexamethasone for treatment MM tumors that have mutations in genes regulating the alternative NFkB pathway
might not be favourable.
In principle, the NFkB pathway could be targeted in
MM tumors by blocking extrinsic activation of the pathway
mediated by factors produced in the BM microenvironment,
or by directly targeting intrinsic components of this pathway. As described above, the sequestration of BAFF and
APRIL ligands by TACI.Fc results in a substantial decrease
in normal murine BM PC. More importantly, an initial clinical trial treating MM patients with Atacicept (TACI.Ig)
showed that the treatment is well-tolerated and decreased
the amount of tumor in some patients [35]. To augment the
inhibition of extrinsic signaling, and especially for the significant fraction of tumors that have acquired mutations in
the NFkB pathway, it would seem useful to simultaneously
use agents that block intrinsic components of both the classical and alternative NFkB pathways.
A number of IAP antagonists that mimic the interaction
of SMAC (natural mammalian IAP antagonist) with IAPs
have been developed. It was demonstrated that SMAC
mimetics can promote apoptosis of various cancer cells
including MM [71-74]. At the same time, we described
that deletion of cIAP1/ 2 leads to strong activation of the
NFkB. It’s possible that inhibition of XIAP in MM cells
leads to induction of apoptosis, but inhibition of cIAP leads
to blocking of apoptosis. In any case, at this time use of
SMAC mimetics for treatment of MM seems of questionable value, at least without further studies.
In fact, several inhibitors of IKKβ kinase, a critical component of the classical NFkB pathway have been
developed. It has been shown that some of the IKKβ
kinase inhibitors efficiently prevented growth of myeloma
cells and induced apoptosis (even in the presence of bone
marrow mononuclear cells) through caspase activation [29,
66, 75]. Unfortunately, specific inhibitors of the alternative
NFkB pathway don’t exist at this time. In view of findings
that a substantial shRNA knock-down of IKKα kinase has
no effect on NFkB activity in MMCL, this may not be the
best molecule to target. Instead, NIK inhibitors would seem
to be a better target for drug development for the following
reasons. First, NIK is the key regulator of the alternative
pathway and is the ultimate target of most of the mutations
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget/

affecting the NFkB pathway in MM. Second, a knock-down
of NIK expression with anti-NIK shRNA can inhibit both
the alternative and classical NFkB pathways when both are
activated as a result of increased levels of NIK. Ultimately,
as they become available, combinations of NIK inhibitors,
IKKβ inhibitors, and Atacicept may provide an effective
therapeutic cocktail to target MGUS and MM tumors
