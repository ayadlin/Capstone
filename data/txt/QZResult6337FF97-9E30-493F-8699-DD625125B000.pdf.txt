Abstract
Bcl-2 is a central regulator of cell survival that is overexpressed in the majority of small cell lung cancers (SCLC) and
contributes to both malignant transformation and therapeutic
resistance. We compared primary SCLC xenografts prepared
from de novo human tumors with standard cell line–based
xenografts in the evaluation of a novel and highly potent
small molecule inhibitor of Bcl-2, ABT-737. ABT-737 induced
dramatic regressions in tumors derived from some SCLC cell
lines. In contrast, only one of three primary xenograft SCLC
tumors showed significant growth inhibition with ABT-737.
Explanations for this apparent dichotomy may include
relatively low expression of Bcl-2 in the primary xenografts
or inherent differences in the model systems. The addition
of etoposide to ABT-737 in the primary xenografts resulted
in significant decreases in tumor growth, underscoring the
clinical potential of ABT-737 in combination therapy. To
identify factors that may contribute to resistance to ABT-737
and related inhibitors, we isolated resistant derivatives of
an initially sensitive cell line–based xenograft. Acquired resistance in this model was associated with decreases in the
expression of the primary target Bcl-2, of proapoptotic partners of Bcl-2 (Bax and Bim), and of Bcl-2:Bim heterodimers.
Expression profiling reveals 85 candidate genes demonstrating consistent changes in gene expression with acquired
resistance. Taken together, these data have specific implications for the clinical development of Bcl-2 inhibitors for
SCLC and broader implications for the testing of novel anticancer strategies in relevant preclinical models. [Cancer Res

Introduction
Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer deaths for both men
and women in the United States (1). Small cell lung cancer (SCLC)
accounts for f15% of all lung cancer cases and is distinguished
from non-SCLC by its characteristic cellular appearance, rapid
proliferation, and early dissemination to metastatic sites. Platinumbased chemotherapy induces responses in up to 70% of newly
diagnosed SCLC and is the standard of care for this disease (2–4).
However, responses to first line chemotherapy are typically of short

duration, and the median survival from the time of diagnosis in
patients with extensive stage SCLC remains <1 year. New
approaches are needed in the management of SCLC.
Bcl-2 was the first identified member of a family of apoptotic
regulators which have at least one Bcl-2 homology domain in
common (5). Bcl-2 family members include antiapoptotic (prosurvival) proteins (e.g., Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, and Mcl-1), multidomain
proapoptotic proteins (e.g., Bax and Bak), and BH3-only proapoptotic proteins (e.g., Bim, Bid, Noxa, and Puma; ref. 5). Interactions
between and relative ratios of proapoptotic and antiapoptotic
Bcl-2 family members are key determinants of cellular sensitivity to
multiple cell death triggers, including many standard chemotherapeutic agents.
Increased expression of Bcl-2 has been reported in 73% to 90%
of SCLC cases and is associated with chemotherapeutic resistance
in SCLC cell lines (6–8). Overexpression of Bcl-2 can abrogate
chemotherapy-induced apoptosis in lung cancer cell lines (9).
Conversely, inhibition of Bcl-2 by an antisense oligonucleotide
results in cytotoxicity and regression of SCLC tumors in preclinical
models. Initial clinical trials combining standard chemotherapy
with an antisense oligonucleotide directed against bcl-2 mRNA
(G3139; oblimersen) in patients with SCLC, however, did not show
significant suppression of Bcl-2 protein levels in vivo (10). Consistent with inadequate target suppression, the addition of G3139
to standard chemotherapeutics did not result in improvements
in objective response or clinical outcome (11).
Investigators at Abbott Laboratories used a combination of nuclear magnetic resonance structure-based design, high-throughput
screening, and iterative lead compound optimization to identify
a family of high-affinity, high-potency small molecule inhibitors
of Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL (12). ABT-737, a Bcl-2/Bcl-xL inhibitor with
affinity in the nanomolar range, has shown activity against several
hematopoietic and solid tumor cell lines and xenografts (12–15).
Based on these observations, an orally bioavailable derivative
of ABT-737 is under early-phase clinical testing in patients with
both solid tumors and hematologic malignancies.
Most preclinical therapeutic assessment in solid tumors
(including all prior evaluation of ABT-737 efficacy) depends on
cancer cell lines established in vitro and analyzed in vivo as cell
line xenografts. Preclinical activity in cell line–based xenografts
have not consistently predicted clinical efficacy of drugs (16).
This failure of traditional models may be in part dependent on
selective pressures that favor establishment and maintenance of
cell lines as monolayers, in high glucose media and with the high
oxygen tension typically present in tissue culture. None of these
features is required for growth and spread of cancers in vivo.
Molecular characterization of glioblastoma multiforme has shown
that growth of primary glioblastoma multiforme tumor samples
in standard serum-containing media (DMEM + 10% FCS), as used

for many commercially available cell lines, induced significant
changes in gene expression and chromosomal alterations when
compared with the original patient samples (17). An alternate
model based on the direct transfer and propagation of human
tumors cells in immunocompromised mice, primary xenografts,
or heterotransplants promotes maintenance of tumor histologic
features, biological behaviors, and gene expression profiles that
closely resemble those of the parental tumor (18). These observations suggest that primary xenograft tumor models may
represent a better platform for preclinical therapeutic testing,
one that may be more predictive of ultimate clinical efficacy.
The aims of this study were to evaluate the activity of ABT-737 in
two distinct models of SCLC, traditionally cultured SCLC cell lines
with varying expression of Bcl-2, and primary SCLC xenografts
derived from chemotherapy-naive patients, alone and in combination with cytotoxic chemotherapy. Based on observations of tumor
recurrence and resistance in several of our xenografts, we have also
initiated studies to look at mechanisms of ABT-737 resistance. Data
on the efficacy of ABT-737 in SCLC cell lines and primary SCLC
xenografts and mechanisms contributing to resistance to ABT-737
have direct implications for the clinical evaluation of Bcl-2
inhibitors in patients with SCLC.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture and reagents. The human SCLC cell lines NCI-H82, NCIH146, NCI-H187, NCI-H209, and NCI-H345 were purchased from and grown
in media recommended by American Type Culture Collection (ATCC). The
H187-63AR derivative was isolated from a recurrent tumor as described in
this report and was grown in media conditions used for H187 cells. ABT-737,
obtained from Abbott Laboratories, was dissolved in DMSO for in vitro
experiments. To prepare ABT-737 for injection, the drug was first mixed
with propylene glycol, Tween-80, and D5W (pH 1.0), then sonicated, and pH
adjusted at 4 to 5. For all in vivo experiments, mice received i.p. injections
(200 AL) of ABT-737 at 100 mg/kg/d for 21 consecutive days. Etoposide
(Novaplus) was diluted in 1 PBS.
Cell viability assays. Cells were collected by centrifugation after
treatment with ABT-737 or DMSO. Cell pellets were resuspended in buffer
containing 1 PBS, 1% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 0.1% sodium azide and
2 Ag/mL propidium iodide. Cells were run on a FACSCalibur flow cytometer and analyzed using CellQuest Pro software (Becton Dickinson). To
calculate EC50 values, nonlinear regression with sigmoidal dose-response
curves (variable slope) was performed using GraphPad Prism version 4.00
for Windows (GraphPad Software). Assays were performed in triplicate.
Western blot. Whole-cell lysates were prepared in radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer supplemented with protease and phosphatase
inhibitors. Protein concentrations were determined by Bradford protein
assay (Bio-Rad Laboratories). Equal protein concentrations of each sample
were run on NuPAGE bis-Tris gels (Invitrogen) and electrophoretically
transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. Membranes were
blocked with TBS containing 5% skim milk and 0.1% Tween 20 and then
probed with antibodies against Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, Noxa, Bax, Bid, and Actin
(all at 1:1,000; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), Mcl-1 (1:1,000; BD PharMingen),
and Bim (1:1,000; Calbiochem). Blots were developed using enhanced
chemiluminescence kit (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
Immunoprecipitations. Whole-cell lysates were prepared in Triton
X-100 buffer (50 mmol/L Tris-HCl, 150 mmol/L NaCl, 5 mmol/L MgCl2,
1 mmol/L EGTA, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100). Total protein (400 Ag)
was precleared with 12 AL (of a 50% slurry) of protein A/G beads (Santa
Cruz Biotechnology). The cleared lysates were incubated overnight at 4jC
with protein A/G beads preexposed for 1 h to anti–Bcl-2 antibody (6C8,
PharMingen). Immunoprecipitates were then washed thrice with Triton
X-100 buffer and boiled in loading buffer (Invitrogen). Immunoblotting
was performed as described above.

Caspase-3/caspase-7 assay. SCLC cell lines were treated with ABT-737
at the indicated doses and assayed for caspase-3/caspase-7 activity.
Equilibrated caspase-Glo 3/7 reagent (Promega) was added to each well
after 24 h of treatment. Luminescence was measured using a Perkin-Elmer
Vision 3. Blank values were subtracted, and fold-increase in activity over
untreated cells was calculated. Assays were performed in triplicate.
SCLC cell line xenografts. Adult homozygous nude mice (Charles River
Laboratories) were s.c. injected with 5 to 8  106 cells suspended in PBS and
Matrigel (BD Biosciences). The nude mice were either injected bilaterally
(H82, H146, H187, H209, and H345) or unilaterally (H187-63AR). Once the
tumors reached z150 mm3, calculated as V = L  W 2 / 2, mice were treated
with i.p. injections of ABT-737 at 100 mg/kg/d or vehicle control. Serial
measurements were taken with a manual caliper. Tumor responses were
plotted with a nonlinear regression curve fit program (GraphPad Prism
version 4.00 for Windows, GraphPad Software).
Primary SCLC xenografts. Primary xenografts LX22, LX33, and LX36
were derived from patients with treatment-naive extensive stage SCLC. In
brief, tumor cells isolated from pleural effusion (LX22) or bronchoscopic
biopsy (LX33, LX36) specimens were prepared into single-cell suspensions,
mixed with Matrigel, and directly injected s.c. into NOD/SCID mice. All
primary xenografts were maintained solely in immunocompromised mice
by serial passaging. Primary xenografts were stained with H&E andCD56 at
various passages to verify that they consistently maintained SCLC histology
and cell surface staining characteristics.
For ABT-737 studies, freshly isolated primary xenograft tumors were
mechanically dissociated into single-cell suspensions; 1  106 viable cells
were resuspended in equal volumes of PBS and Matrigel and injected
s.c. in adult homozygous C.B-17/SCID mice (Charles River Laboratories).
Once the tumors reached z130 mm3 (average, 14 d), the mice were treated
with vehicle control, ABT-737 (100 mg/kg/d on days 1–21), etoposide
(12 mg/kg/d on days 1, 4, and 9), or a combination of ABT-737 and
etoposide.
Statistical analyses were performed for each primary xenograft
separately. Initial tumor volume measurements are summarized using
means, SDs, and ranges. Growth patterns were summarized graphically by
plotting the mean and SD for each treatment group over time. The rate of
growth is modeled using a log-linear random effects model. This model
takes into account the correlation between multiple measurements on each
mouse. The estimated growth rate per day is reported with 95% confidence
intervals. A conditional t test is used to compare etoposide, ABT-737, and
combination treatment with the control. A P value of <0.05 is considered
statistically significant.
Immunohistochemistry. Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tumors
were sectioned, dewaxed, and incubated in 10 mmol/L sodium citrate
(pH 8) for 20 min at 95jC for antigen retrieval. Sections were stained using
the Vectastain ABC system according to manufacturer’s instructions with a
rabbit anti-CD56 antibody (Chemicon). To assess for apoptosis, LX22
tumors were collected after five consecutive days of ABT-737 treatment.
The sections were prepared as described above and incubated with antiactivated caspase-3 antibody (Cell Signaling Technologies) and visualized
using an horseradish peroxidase–conjugated secondary antibody and 3,3¶diaminobenzidine reagent (Dako Envision+, Dako).
Illumina microbead array. Total RNA was extracted using the Trizol
reagent method (Invitrogen) and purified with RNAeasy columns (Qiagen).
RNA quality was assessed using an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent
Technologies). RNA samples were labeled according to the chip manufacturer’s recommended protocols. In brief, 0.5 Ag of total RNA from each
sample was labeled using the Illumina TotalPrep RNA amplification kit
(Ambion) in a process of cDNA synthesis and in vitro transcription. Singlestranded RNA (cRNA) was generated and labeled by incorporating biotin16-UTP (Roche Diagnostics GmbH) and hybridized to an Illumina Sentrix
Human Ref-8 Expression Beadchip (Illumina). The hybridized biotinylated
cRNA was detected with streptavidin-Cy3 and quantitated using an Illumina
BeadStation 500GX genetic analysis systems scanner.
Illumina gene set analysis. Two biological samples from each tumor
(H187 and H187-63AR) were hybridized to an Illumina BeadChip. Image
level analysis and preprocessing was performed using BeadStudio software

(Bead Studio Gene Expression Module Users Guide May 2006) according to
manufacturers recommendations. The preprocessing algorithm includes
outlier detection and produces an average expression value for each
oligonucleotide probe sequence. Data analysis and plotting of the
expression profiles was done using the R statistical platform (19) and the
Bioconductor bioinformatics software project (20). Preprocessed expression
values were transformed to a log scale and averaged over replicates for each
of the experimental conditions. Genes having log 2-fold changes >1 were
used to cluster samples for comparison and presentation.
Real-time PCR. RNA was isolated from H187-63AR and H187 tumors
by Trizol extraction. cDNA was prepared from using the Quantitect Reverse
Transcription kit (Qiagen). Predesigned and validated gene-specific probebased TaqMan gene expression assays for CEPBD, FZD9, GPX2, NELL1,
PRSS3, RTN1, and STMN2 (Applied Biosystems) were used for quantitative
PCR. h-Actin gene (ACTB) was used as a control. The accumulation of
amplicons during the reaction was detected by FAM Green (Applied
Biosystems). The data were analyzed using the Bio-Rad iQ5 (version 2.0)
software. Gene expression was analyzed from three parallel plates for each
group. Each sample was run in triplicate for an individual plate.

Results
Effect of ABT-737 on cell viability and caspase-3 activation
in SCLC cell lines. Western analysis of lysates from five SCLC cell
lines showed that H146, H187, H209, and H345 cell lines expressed
relatively high levels of the primary target of ABT-737, Bcl-2,
whereas the H82 cell line expressed very low levels of Bcl-2
(Fig. 1A). All five cell lines expressed similar levels of Bcl-xL. We
then assessed the effect of ABT-737 treatment on these five SCLC
cell lines. Cell lines were incubated in media containing 0.03 to
100 Amol/L ABT-737. The EC50 for each cell line was defined as the
dose of ABT-737 required to cause 50% loss in viability of cells
at 48 hours. Four of the five SCLC cell lines, H146, H187, H209,
and H345, had EC50 values ranging from 0.06 to 0.5 Amol/L.
The NCI-H82 cells were less sensitive to ABT-737, with an EC50 of
17.5 Amol/L (Fig. 1B).
To evaluate the target specificity of the responses seen in
sensitive and less sensitive SCLC cell lines, the ability of ABT-737 to
activate apoptosis in H146 and H82 cells was assessed by cleavage
of a DEVD-containing luminescent substrate. ABT-737 induced
significant caspase activation in H146 cells by 24 hours at a
pharmacologic dose (0.06 Amol/L) consistent with target inhibition

in Bcl-2–dependent cells (Fig. 1C). In contrast, at 24 hours, ABT-737
was unable to induce significant capase-3 activation in H82 cells at
100 Amol/L, a dose of >5  EC50, suggesting that the toxicity of
ABT-737 in H82 cells may be due to off-target effects.
Antitumor effect of ABT-737 on SCLC cell line xenografts.
We next wanted to assess the in vivo activity of ABT-737 against
xenografts derived from cell lines of differing in vitro sensitivities.
Nude mice bearing xenografts derived from the H82, H146, H187,
H209, and H345 SCLC lines were treated i.p. with ABT-737 or
control vehicle for 21 days (Fig. 2). H146 and H187 xenografts
rapidly regressed after the initiation of treatment with ABT-737. In
particular, H187 xenograft tumors regressed below the level of
detection by day 14, an effect which lasted for at least 7 days after
the completion of treatment (H187 data shown in Fig. 3A). H209
and H345 xenografts showed intermediate sensitivity to ABT-737,
with statistically significant decreases in growth rate and doubling
time. Consistent with the in vitro data, H82 xenografts were
resistant to the effects of ABT-737. Most H82 mice, regardless of
treatment arm, were sacrificed before completion of the planned
21-day treatment due to rapidly increasing tumor size and
ulceration.
A cell line derived from a recurrent ABT-737–resistant
tumor maintains moderate resistance in vitro and in vivo.
Acquired therapeutic resistance even after dramatic initial
response is a major clinical problem in the management of SCLC.
Treatment of H187 xenografts with ABT-737 resulted in evident
complete antitumor responses. However, with continued monitoring of treated animals, we observed that some of the tumors
recurred after the completion of therapy (Fig. 3A). To assess
whether these tumors were still ABT-737 sensitive, we re-treated
two mice with recurrent tumors with a second 21-day cycle of ABT737 (arrow). Both recurrent tumors continued to progress despite
treatment, consistent with acquired resistance to the drug. A cell
line, H187-63AR, was derived from one of these recurrent tumors
and maintained in vitro without ABT-737. In vitro, this derivative
cell line had an EC50 of 0.5 Amol/L, f5 higher than that of the
parental H187 cell line (data not shown).
To test whether H187-63AR cells maintained ABT-737 resistance
in vivo, nude mice were injected s.c. to establish H187-63AR
xenograft tumors. When the tumors reached z150 mm3, the mice

were randomized to receive vehicle or ABT-737 for 21 days. Nude
mice bearing parental H187 xenografts were treated in parallel.
H187-63AR control tumors grew at similar rates as H187 control
tumors, suggesting that changes mediating ABT-737 resistance
in this cell line did not alter basal tumor growth rates (Fig. 3B).
As seen previously, H187 tumors completely regressed within
2 weeks of starting ABT-737 therapy. ABT-737–treated H187-63AR
xenografts showed an intermediate phenotype, with a decrease in
growth rate but no tumor regression, consistent with acquired
resistance to the drug.
To identify putative determinants of acquired ABT-737 resistance, we first compared expression of Bcl-2 family members in
parental and resistant H187 tumors. Western analysis of tumor
lysates showed that the expression of Bcl-2, Bax, and particularly
Bim were decreased in the H187-63AR tumors relative to H187
tumors (Fig. 3C). Abundance of Bcl-2:Bim complexes has recently
been reported as a correlate of ABT-737 sensitivity in lymphoma
cells. To test whether there was a change in Bim association with
Bcl-2 in the resistant derivative, we performed immunoprecipitations on H187 and H187-63AR lysates using anti–Bcl-2 antibodies.
Consistent with the results in lymphoma lines, we found that H187-

Cancer Res 2008; 68: (7). April 1, 2008

63AR cells had significantly less Bim complexed with Bcl-2 than did
H187 cells (Fig. 3C).
As an initial probe for additional factors that may contribute
to ABT-737 resistance, we compared the gene expression profiles
of two independent H187-63AR–derived tumors with those of
parental H187 tumors by Illumina microbead array analysis (GEO
accession number GSE10003). A cutoff of at least a 2-fold change
in expression was considered to be a minimal change of
interest. This analysis defined a panel of 85 candidate genes that
seem to be significantly differentially expressed in parental versus
ABT-737–resistant derivatives of H187 (Fig. 3D; Supplementary
Table S1). From the list, we selected seven genes (CEBPD, FZD9,
GPX2, NELL1, PRSS3, RTN1, and STMN2) implicated in tumorigenesis and assessed their expression by quantitative PCR. Validating
the microarray data, we found that CEPBD, FZD9, NELL1, and
PRSS3 expression was decreased and that GPX2, RTN1, and STMN2
expression was increased in H187-63AR tumors compared with
H187 tumors (Supplementary data). Confirmation of the roles of
these candidate genes as factors contributing to ABT-737 resistance
will require cross-validation in independent models of acquired
resistance and individual gene expression cloning.

ABT-737 in Small Cell Lung Cancer Primary Xenografts

SCLC primary xenografts maintain characteristics of human
SCLC. The primary SCLC xenografts used in this study were serially
passaged in immunocompromised mice. H&E staining of the
tumors shows the tumors maintain morphologic characteristics of
SCLC (Fig. 4). Serially passaged tumors from all three primary
SCLC xenografts maintain consistent expression of CD56 (neural
cell adhesion molecule, an antigen expressed in the vast majority
of SCLC; ref. 21) as assessed by immunohistochemistry (Fig. 4) and
flow cytometry (data not shown).
ABT-737 induces apoptosis and exhibits synergistic effects
with etoposide against primary SCLC xenografts. To assess the
expression of Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL in three SCLC primary xenografts,
we performed Western analysis on lysates from freshly isolated
tumors. Compared with the H345 SCLC cell line, LX22, LX33, and
LX36 tumors express lower levels of Bcl-2, but comparable levels of
Bcl-xL and Mcl-1 (Fig. 5A). To evaluate whether ABT-737 was able
to induce apoptosis in primary xenografts, LX22 tumors were
harvested after five consecutive days of ABT-737 treatment and
stained for activated caspase-3 by immunohistochemistry. Despite

the relatively low levels of Bcl-2 in the LX22 xenografts, treatment
with ABT-737 resulted in activated caspase-3–positive cells in vivo
(Fig. 5B).
We next wanted to assess whether the dramatic antitumor
activity of ABT-737 seen in most standard cell line–based
xenografts would be reflected in a similar activity in the primary
xenograft model and further assess this activity compared with that
of a standard clinically available cytotoxic agent. C.B-17/SCID mice
bearing LX33 primary xenografts were treated with ABT-737,
etoposide, or vehicle control. Treatment with either etoposide or
ABT-737 caused similar decreases in tumor growth rate, but neither
resulted in prolonged antitumor response (Fig. 6A; Supplementary
Table S2). For studies in LX22 and LX36 primary xenografts, we
added a fourth arm, combination treatment with etoposide and
ABT-737. In LX22 primary xenografts, treatment with ABT-737 or
etoposide monotherapy resulted in minor, but statistically significant decreases in tumor growth and combination treatment
had a greater effect than either single agent (Fig. 6B). In LX36
primary xenografts, etoposide monotherapy caused a significant

early as 7 d after the completion of treatment. At day 76 (arrow), two mice were treated with a second cycle of ABT-737 at 100 mg/kg/d for 21 d. The H187-63AR cell line

decrease in tumor growth, but ABT-737 alone did not. The
combination of ABT-737 plus etoposide resulted in a statistically
significant decrease in tumor growth rate compared with control
(Fig. 6C). Taken together, these data show that the primary
xenograft tumors were less responsive to ABT-737 than most
xenografts derived from ex vivo SCLC cell lines.

Discussion
ABT-737 binds Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL with high affinity and has shown
single-agent efficacy against multiple myeloma, acute myeloid

leukemia, lymphoma, and solid tumor cell lines. It has also shown
activity in combination with standard therapy in human leukemia
and multiple myeloma models (22–24). We first evaluated ABT-737
efficacy in a panel of five SCLC cell lines and observed a range
of sensitivity in vitro and in vivo. Consistent with the known
mechanism of ABT-737, the H82 cell line which expresses very low
levels of Bcl-2 was relatively resistant to ABT-737 in vitro and
in vivo, and the cytotoxicity seen in this line at a high ABT-737 dose
was nonapoptotic. Given that H82 cells express Bcl-xL, which is also
inhibited by ABT-737, the growth of H82 may be Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL
independent. The remaining four cell lines expressed higher, closely
matched levels of Bcl-2. Among these four cell lines, we found that
in vivo antitumor efficacy correlated with in vitro EC50 data; H146
and H187 cells had the lowest EC50 values and completely
regressed with ABT-737 treatment in vivo. H209 and H345 cells
had higher, although still micromolar, EC50 values than did the
H146 and H187 cell lines and showed intermediate sensitivity to
ABT-737 in vivo.
As an approach to identifying mechanisms of ABT-737 resistance
in SCLC cell lines, we initiated studies to characterize recurrent,
ABT-737–resistant tumors derived from H187 SCLC xenografts.
A cell line established from one of these ABT-737–resistant tumors,
H187-63AR, maintained relative resistance to ABT-737 in vitro
and in vivo. Recent work in lymphoma cell lines showed that Bcl-2,
Bim, and Bax levels and Bcl-2:Bim and Bcl-2:Bax interactions
correlated with ABT-737 sensitivity. Of these associations, Bcl-2
expression and increased Bcl-2:Bim interactions, either of which
might signify cellular dependence on Bcl-2, were the strongest
predictors of ABT-737 sensitivity (25). We found that the H18763AR cells express lower levels of Bcl-2, Bax, and Bim than H187
cells. Furthermore, we found that H187-63AR cells had lower
abundance of Bim complexed with Bcl-2. Alterations in Bcl-2 family
members, particularly decreased Bim and Bcl-2–associated Bim,
may contribute to the ABT-737 resistance we observed in H18763AR–derivative cells.
We also used cDNA microarray analysis to identify 85 genes
whose expression was altered >2-fold between the parental and
ABT-737–resistant tumors. To validate the microarray data, we
confirmed differential expression of seven genes implicated in
tumorigenesis by real-time PCR. Consistent with the microarray

ABT-737 in Small Cell Lung Cancer Primary Xenografts

Figure 6. In vivo studies of ABT-737 or etoposide in LX33 primary xenografts (A ) or ABT-737, etoposide or combination of ABT-737 and etoposide in LX22 (B) and

data, we found up-regulation of GPX2, RTN1, and STMN2 and
down-regulation of CEBPD, FXD9, NELL1, and PRSS3. Further
characterization of these genes may aid in the identification of
factors that contribute to ABT-737 resistance and ultimately may
help predict response to ABT-737.
We expanded our preclinical studies to include a model system
not dependent on ex vivo selection of tumor cells for growth in
tissue culture. Several studies support the utility of primary
xenografts as a model system for prediction of clinical drug
efficacy. To date, ABT-737 has been evaluated in primary models
of hematologic malignancies, including multiple myeloma and
leukemia. ABT-737 was able to induce apoptosis in primary
multiple myeloma and primary acute myelogenous leukemia
(AML) samples treated ex vivo (13, 14). ABT-737 enhanced the
efficacy of dexamethasone, vincristine, and L-aspariginase in a
primary in vivo model of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (24).
A primary xenograft model of SCLC has not been previously
reported. We established three primary SCLC xenografts as a model
system to evaluate ABT-737 and other novel SCLC therapeutics. All
three primary xenografts were derived from therapy-naive SCLC
patients and maintained the histologic appearance and CD56
antigen staining patterns of SCLC.
In contrast to its efficacy against most SCLC cell line–based
tumors, ABT-737 did not cause regression of the primary SCLC
xenografts. Treatment with ABT-737 monotherapy, however, reduced the growth rate of LX22 tumors, which had the highest
expression of Bcl-2 among the three primary xenografts. ABT-737
did not show significant single-agent activity against the LX33
or LX36 primary xenografts. Our finding that cell line xenografts
were more sensitive to ABT-737 monotherapy than were the primary xenografts could be due to several factors, including relative
expression of and dependence on Bcl-2 or other Bcl-2 family
members and inherent characteristics of patient tumors selected
for growth in immunocompromised mice.
In contrast to published observations that Bcl-2 is expressed in
the majority of SCLC cases and SCLC cell lines, all three primary
xenografts in this study express low levels of Bcl-2. It is unlikely
that direct transfer of tumors cells into immunocompromised
mice selects for Bcl-2–independent tumors as Bcl-2 expression has
been shown in primary xenografts derived from other tumor types
(26–28). The three primary xenografts were derived from patients
with treatment-naive SCLC. This stands in contrast to most avail-

able SCLC cell lines, which are derived from multiply pretreated
disease. Evaluation of ABT-737 in additional primary SCLC
xenograft models derived from de novo as well as recurrent tumors
may help better define its potential role as monotherapy or in the
second-line setting.
It is likely that ultimate clinical utility of agents, such as ABT-737,
will require combination therapy with standard cytotoxic agents.
In addition to evaluating single-agent activity in the primary
xenograft model, we sought to test whether ABT-737 could enhance
the activity of etoposide, a first-line agent in the treatment of SCLC
and a potent inducer of apoptosis. In both primary xenografts
tested, LX22 and LX36, the combination of ABT-737 and etoposide,
caused statistically significant decreases in tumor growth rates
relative to control. That ABT-737 can enhance to the activity of
etoposide, even in low Bcl-2–expressing tumors, further supports
its potential for clinical use.
Expression of antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family members not inhibited by
ABT-737, in particular Mcl-1, has been implicated as a determinant
of ABT-737 resistance. Reduction of Mcl-1 by small interfering RNA
or targeted therapy can overcome ABT-737 resistance in multiple
in vitro models (29, 30). In SCLC cell lines chronically exposed to
ABT-737, ABT-737 resistance was associated with increased expression of Mcl-1 and decreased expression of proapoptotic Noxa (31).
As all three primary xenografts express Mcl-1, other agents to
consider in combination with ABT-737 could include Mcl-1–targeted
therapies. Sorafenib, a Food and Drug Administration–approved
agent in the treatment of renal cell carcinoma, has been shown to
decrease Mcl-1 in an AML model (32). Cisplatin, a first-line agent
in the treatment of SCLC, decreases Mcl-1 levels in human renal
tubular epithelial cells (33). The primary xenografts may serve as
representative models that test combinatorial therapies with agents
that down-regulate multiple members of the Bcl-2 family.
As an oral derivative of ABT-737, ABT-263 has recently been
introduced into phase I/phase II clinical trials; the identification of
determinants of sensitivity to this agent has significant clinical
implications. Preclinical studies of ABT-737 to date, including the
studies presented here, show ABT-737 efficacy against tumors which
express high levels of Bcl-2. Our work with primary SCLC xenografts
revealed that, in combination with cytotoxic chemotherapy, such as
etoposide, ABT-737 may have utility even in tumors which express
low levels of Bcl-2. Combinatorial therapy designed to inhibit
multiple members of the Bcl-2 family may be an interesting avenue

for future studies. Further evaluation of drug resistant derivative
tumors may provide information on factors and pathways that will
guide clinical development of the targeted Bcl-2 inhibitors.
