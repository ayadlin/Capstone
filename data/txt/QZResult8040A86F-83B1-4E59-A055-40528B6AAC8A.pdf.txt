BACKGROUND: The objectives were to compare infections during different intensities of therapy in children with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). METHODS: Subjects were children enrolled in Children’s Cancer
Group 2891 with AML. In phase 1 (induction), patients were randomized to intensive or standard timing. In
phase 2 (consolidation), those with a family donor were allocated allogeneic stem cell transplantation
(SCT); the remainder were randomized to autologous SCT or chemotherapy. This report compares infections between different treatments on an intent-to-treat basis. RESULTS: During phase 1, intensive timing
was associated with more bacterial (57.7% vs 39.4%; P < .001), fungal (27.4% vs 9.9%; P < .001), and viral
(14.0% vs 3.9%; P < .001) infections compared with standard timing. During phase 2, chemotherapy was
associated with more bacterial (56.5% vs 40.1%; P ¼ .005), but similar fungal (9.5% vs 6.1%; P ¼ 1.000) and
viral (4.2% vs 12.9%; P ¼ .728) infections compared with allogeneic SCT. No differences between chemotherapy and autologous SCT infections were seen. Fatal infections were more common during intensive
compared with standard timing induction (5.5% vs 0.9%; P ¼ .004). Infectious deaths were similar between
chemotherapy, autologous SCT, and allogeneic SCT. CONCLUSIONS: Prevalence of infection varies depending on the intensity and type of treatment. This information sheds insight into the mechanisms behind susC 2009 American Cancer

Infections are an important cause or morbidity and mortality for children with acute myeloid
leukemia (AML).1-5 These patients are at particularly high risk of infection, likely related to the intensity of their therapy and the therapy’s focus on the myeloid compartment, resulting in repeated
episodes of prolonged and profound neutropenia. In previous pediatric AML trials, 29% to 60% of
children experienced at least 1 microbiologically documented infection.2,4 Infections not only

contribute to mortality but also prolong hospitalization, compromise subsequent chemotherapy delivery,
affect quality of life, and increase healthcare
utilization.
We know clinically that children receiving different
intensities of chemotherapy will experience different frequencies of infectious complications. However, rarely are
different therapies administered to similar, contemporaneous populations with the same disease, and thus, it has
been difficult to understand whether therapy, disease,
host, or environmental characteristics are most influential
in infection risks. Understanding the prevalence and characteristics of invasive bacterial, fungal, and viral infections
according to different types of anticancer therapy in similar populations may shed insight into mechanisms behind
susceptibility and outcome of infections by different
pathogens.
Given this consideration, we wished to explore bacterial, fungal, and viral infections in children enrolled in
Children’s Cancer Group (CCG) 2891; in this protocol,
infection data were prospectively collected during treatment phases of differing intensity. This trial included a
randomization between intensive timing and standard
timing induction chemotherapy in phase 1. During phase
2, those with a suitable family donor were allocated to
allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT), whereas those
without a donor were randomized to autologous SCT or
chemotherapy. Therefore, the design of this trial allowed
us to examine, among comparable groups of patients,
how intensive timing affects the prevalence of infection
in phase 1 and how different types of treatment affect the
prevalence of infection in phase 2. We focused on microbiologically documented infections because these are the
most objective to classify. We hypothesized that the
prevalence of infections would be higher in intensive
timing versus standard timing during phase 1 and that
for phase 2, the prevalence of infection would be highest
for allogeneic SCT, given the intensity of conditioning
and contribution of graft-versus-host disease to infection
outcomes.
The objectives of this study were to compare the
prevalence and characteristics of microbiologically documented bacterial, fungal, and viral infections during different intensities of anticancer therapy in children with
AML enrolled in CCG 2891.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients
The patients included in this report were those enrolled in
CCG 2891.6,7 Children aged <21 years with newly diagnosed AML, and acute undifferentiated or biphenotypic
leukemia with evidence of myeloid differentiation, were
eligible. Patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia
became ineligible in April 1992. For this report, patients
with Down syndrome, AML as a second malignancy,
myelodysplastic syndrome, or isolated chloroma were
excluded. We also excluded 15 patients who started with
standard timing and whose protocol was changed to intensive timing when an analysis revealed the superiority of
intensive timing.
The specific therapy of this trial consisted of
2 phases of therapy. Phase 1 contained 4 cycles of induction chemotherapy. Initial treatment consisted of 2 cycles
of a 5-drug regimen of chemotherapy administered over
4 days: dexamethasone, cytarabine, 6-thioganine, etoposide, and rubidomycin (DCTER). Patients were randomized to receive the second cycle of DCTER either with
intensive timing after a 6-day rest period irrespective of
bone marrow status or hematological recovery, or to
standard timing in which bone marrow was examined on
Day 14. Those in whom the Day 14 marrow demonstrated good leukemia response had their second DCTER
administered when the blood counts recovered, whereas
those with >40% blasts on their Day 14 bone marrow
proceeded to the second DCTER at that time. The next 2
cycles of induction chemotherapy were then administered, which consisted of 2 cycles of DCTER given as either intensive or standard timing according to the initial
randomization. All patients in both arms received identical amounts of total induction chemotherapy. Those in
remission after 4 DCTER cycles with an appropriate family donor were allocated to allogeneic SCT. All others
were randomized between autologous SCT versus intensive chemotherapy. Intensive chemotherapy consisted of 4
courses of 3 chemotherapy regimens. Course 1 consisted
of high-dose, intensively timed cytarabine, and L-asparaginase; courses 2 and 3 consisted of 6-thioguanine, vincristine, cytarabine, cyclophosphamide, and 5-azacytidine;
and course 4 consisted of cytarabine, daunorubicin, etoposide, 6-thioganine, and dexamethasone (a modified
1101

DCTER). Collectively, either SCT or the 4 courses of intensive chemotherapy were referred to as phase 2. As only
course 1 was composed of intensive chemotherapy, the
description of infections during phase 2 chemotherapy
was limited to this course. Initially, the use of hematopoietic growth factors was not permitted except for granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor, which was
allowed for poor engraftment after SCT. However, in an
attempt to reduce infection outcomes, prophylactic granulocyte colony–stimulating factor was introduced in 1993
in a nonrandomized fashion. Results of this intervention
have previously been reported.8 Other than for these indications, the use of prophylactic colony-stimulating factor
was discouraged. All children received trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole prophylaxis against Pneumocystis jiroveci.
Either nystatin or clotrimazole troches were recommended for fungal prophylaxis.
Those allocated to allogeneic or autologous SCT
were conditioned using 4 days of oral busulfan and 4 days
of cyclophosphamide. For autologous SCT recipients,
bone marrow was harvested with 4-hydroperoxycyclophosphamide ex vivo purging. For allogeneic SCT recipients, graft versus host disease prophylaxis consisted of
15 mg/m2 of methotrexate on Day 1 followed by 10 mg/
m2 on Days 3, 6, and 11 and weekly until Day 100. This
trial was open to patient accrual from October 1989 to
May 1995.
The 2 main comparisons for this report were in
phase 1 between those randomized to intensive timing
and standard timing induction chemotherapy, and in
phase 2 between those with a matched family donor (allogeneic SCT) and those randomized to autologous SCT or
chemotherapy.7 These comparisons all were conducted in
an intent-to-treat fashion to overcome biases inherent in
an analysis by treatment received.

Outcomes and Potential Predictors
Infections were prospectively collected by the institutional
clinical research associates using a standardized data collection form. This report focuses on microbiologically
documented bacterial, fungal, and viral infections, which
were defined as any positive culture, although data managers were instructed not to report positive surveillance
cultures. Reporting of fungal infection was limited to
1102

microbiologically documented infections, because insufficient clinical information was available to classify fungal
infections according to the Mycoses Study Group/European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer
guidelines.9 Microbiologically documented infections
were considered in a fashion similar to that previously
described.4 Episodes with the same organisms within the
same phase of therapy were counted as different infections
if they occurred more than 7 days apart. In the case of
common contaminants such as coagulase-negative staphylococci and Gram-positive bacilli, insufficient clinical information was available to distinguish between likely
contaminants versus invasive infections and in this study,
positive cultures were included as infectious episodes.
Multiple organisms from the same child within the same
phase of therapy were considered separate infections.
Potential predictors of infection outcomes that were
examined were regimen assigned in induction (intensive
vs standard timing) and type of therapy in phase 2 (intensive chemotherapy during course 1, autologous SCT, and
allogeneic SCT). In addition, we examined age (at study
entry) and ethnicity as potential predictors of infections.
Because of the potential for an interaction between these
variables and treatment, we only performed these regressions in the intensive timing group for phase 1 and in the
course 1 chemotherapy group for phase 2.

Statistical Analysis
The number of infections was expressed as the prevalence
within a given phase of therapy, and it is a simple fraction
of the number of patients experiencing at least 1 given
infection compared with all patients undertaking the
same therapy. The time period at risk was during study
chemotherapy administration or SCT and did not include
time after removal from study for any reason, or relapse.
For most children, the time period at risk began on the
day chemotherapy was initiated and extended until the
day before initiation of the next course of chemotherapy
except for SCT. The follow-up period for SCT was
100 days after transplantation. The prevalence of infection between different treatment types was compared
using the chi-square test. To determine whether the number of infections varied according to age or ethnicity irrespective of type of therapy, the incidence (per 100 patient
days of therapy) of infection was modeled either using

Poisson or negative binomial regression depending
roughly on the observed variance (what is called overdispersion) of the average incidence rates. Effects were
expressed as the incidence rate ratio (IRR). The IRR
expresses the increase in risk of an outcome for a 1-unit
change in the covariate and can be considered analogous
to a relative risk. This analysis was restricted to those
randomized to intensive timing in phase 1 and those
randomized to chemotherapy in phase 2. The analysis of
infectious deaths by type of treatment censored patients at
relapse or death.
Statistical analyses were performed using SAS software (version 8.2, SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC.) or Stata
software (StataCorp. 2005 Stata Statistical Software
Releases 8, 9, College Station, Tex). All tests of significance were 2-sided, and statistical significance was defined
as P < .05.

RESULTS
A total of 872 patients were enrolled in CCG 2891.
Details of the demographics have previously been published.6 Of these 872 patients, 678 were randomized to
intensive versus standard timing induction, and 452 were

allocated or randomized to chemotherapy, autologous
SCT, or allogeneic SCT in phase 2. For the induction
question, 194 nonrandomized patients were allocated to
intensive timing when an analysis revealed better disease
outcome with intensive timing. The nonrandomized
patients are not included in the after analyses. Compliance
with randomization and allocation was excellent. Of the
subjects randomized to standard versus intensive timing
allocation, only 15 children did not receive the randomized treatment. Compliance with consolidation therapy,
either randomized or allocated, was 88% overall.
Table 1 illustrates the number of patients having at
least 1 bacterial, fungal, or viral infection during the specified phases of therapy and the most common species of
Gram-positive and Gram-negative infections during
phase 1 and phase 2 treatments. During phase 1, intensive
timing was associated with more bacterial infections compared with standard timing (57.7% vs 39.4%; P < .001).
We noted either significant or nonsignificant tendencies
for more infections during intensive timing with most
Gram-positive and -negative pathogens. In particular,
there was a significance increase in viridans group streptococcal infections associated with intensive timing induction. In contrast, infections with coagulase-negative
1103

Original Article

staphylococci and Staphylococcus aureus occurred at a similar frequency in the intensive and standard timing groups
(Table 1). Fungal infections also were more common in
intensive timing for both yeasts (19.0% vs 8.4%; P <
.001) and molds (11.7% vs 1.5%; P < .001). Finally, viral
infections occurred more frequently during intensive timing (14.0% vs 3.9%; P < .001). During intensive timing,
viral infections consisted of herpes simplex (n ¼ 25), rotavirus (n ¼ 6), cytomegalovirus (n ¼ 5), influenza (n ¼ 4),
herpes zoster (n ¼ 3), parainfluenza (n ¼ 3), adenovirus
(n ¼ 2), and respiratory syncytial virus (n ¼ 2). During
standard timing, viral infections consisted of herpes simplex (n ¼ 7), herpes zoster virus (n ¼ 3), influenza (n ¼
1), parainfluenza (n ¼ 1), and rotavirus (n ¼ 1).
Table 1 also demonstrates that during phase 2,
chemotherapy was associated with more bacterial infections (56.5% vs 40.1%; P ¼ .005) and more viridans
group streptococcal bacteremia (16.1% vs 2.7%; P <
.001) compared with allogeneic SCT. Conversely, chemotherapy and allogeneic SCT were associated with similar
risks of fungal infections (9.5% vs 6.1%; P ¼ 1.000) and
viral infections (4.2% vs 12.9%; P ¼ .728). We may have
overestimated infections in the allogeneic SCT arm,
because infections were collected to 100 days after SCT,
compared with the start of the next phase of treatment in
the chemotherapy arm. Thus, we also compared the incidence of infections per 100 days in chemotherapy relative
to allogeneic SCT recipients, and the same pattern of
greater infections with chemotherapy was seen (data not
shown). No differences between bacterial, fungal, or viral
infections were noted between phase 2 chemotherapy and
autologous SCT. The prevalence of infections during
phase 2 may be affected by the length of the reporting period for each type of therapy. In phase 2, the median duration of course 1 chemotherapy was 44 days (range, 1-253
days), whereas the median duration for autologous SCT
was 110 days (range, 20-162 days), and the median duration for allogeneic SCT was 111 days (range, 2-410 days).
The prevalence of infections during phase 2 chemotherapy, autologous SCT, and allogeneic SCT were not higher
in those who had received phase 1 intensive timing compared with those who had received standard timing (data
not shown).
Table 2 illustrates the affect of age on the risk of various infections during phase 1 and 2. During phase 1,
infections did not vary depending upon patient age. Con1104

versely, children aged >10 years had a higher risk of fungal infections in phase 2 (IRR, 2.763; 95% confidence
interval, 1.221-6.253; P ¼ .012). Table 3 demonstrates
that ethnicity had little impact on infections other than
black children having fewer fungal infections in phase 2
(IRR, 0.00; P ¼ .005).
Table 4 illustrates that there were 33 fatal infections.
Bacterial infections were responsible for 19 (58%) infection deaths, whereas molds were responsible for 11 (33%)
fatal infections. Table 5 illustrates the number of children
who died of infection according to intensity of induction
therapy (intensive vs standard timing) or type of consolidation (chemotherapy, autologous SCT, and allogeneic
SCT). In addition, infectious deaths in consolidation are
illustrated according to the type of induction received.
Infection deaths were significantly more common during
intensive timing in induction (5.5% vs 0.9%; P ¼ .004),
whereas deaths were similarly distributed between chemotherapy, autologous SCT, and allogeneic SCT (Table 5).

DISCUSSION
We found that in CCG 2891, a phase 3 pediatric AML
trial, more bacterial, fungal, and viral infections were associated with intensive timing compared with standard timing, and more infectious deaths were associated with
intensive timing. However, this increase did not occur
uniformly, and infections with Staphylococcus species
occurred at a similar frequency. In contrast to our
expected finding, more bacterial infections and more viridans group streptococcal bacteremia were associated
with phase 2 chemotherapy compared with allogeneic
SCT. We also found that Gram-negative organisms and
molds continue to contribute to fatal infections in pediatric AML.
Our data are unique for several reasons. We have
reported infection data for the largest cohort of children
with AML to date, and because of the design of the trial,
we have comparable groups of children treated with different intensities of therapy (intensive vs standard timing)
as well as different types of treatment (chemotherapy, autologous SCT, and allogeneic SCT). This design provides
an opportunity to gain insight into how the prevalence of
bacterial infection varies depending on treatment.
We found that the prevalence of infection was
higher with intensive timing compared with standard

timing induction, which was expected. However, during
phase 2, bacterial infections and viridans group streptococcal infections were less common with allogeneic SCT
compared with chemotherapy. Similar finds were seen
when infections only with alpha hemolytic streptococci
were examined on this same trial.10 The finding of more
infections with chemotherapy compared with allogeneic
SCT was surprising. It is possible that the risk of infection
is indeed greater with chemotherapy. However, other possible explanations for this finding include the use of antibacterial prophylaxis11,12 or hematopoietic colonystimulating factors during allogeneic SCT,13 because
these interventions can reduce the risk of infections. However, use of these interventions should have been minimal,
because the protocol discouraged prophylactic use of colony-stimulating factors during SCT, and the only antibiotic prophylaxis proscribed by the protocol was
trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Unfortunately, data on
these interventions were not collected. In addition,

because the difference in prevalence of infections in chemotherapy relative to allogeneic SCT appeared to be related
more to viridans group streptococci with chemotherapy,
this finding provides further evidence that high-dose
cytarabine is a specific risk factor for infections with viridans group streptococci, because all these types of consolidation would be expected to cause severe mucositis.10
Even with fewer infections occurring during allogeneic
SCT, the risk of treatment-related mortality was higher
with allogeneic SCT, which occurred in 14% of such
patients, compared with 4% in the chemotherapy arm
and 5% in the autologous SCT arm.7
Despite more fatal infections with intensive timing
induction, event-free survival at 3 years was significantly
better with intensive timing (42%  7%) compared with
standard timing (27%  6%; P ¼ .0005).6 Consequently,
the increased infectious deaths were offset by improved
disease control. Nonetheless, given a better understanding
of increased infections with intensive timing, strategies to

reduce those infectious deaths may continue to improve
survival associated with intensive induction treatment.
Some may argue that the findings from this study
are less important because therapy similar to CCG 2891 is
not currently commonly used to treat children with AML.
Although this is true, the principles of our findings of the
high risk of bacterial infections, the association between
the risk of infections and type of treatment, the role of
Gram-negative organisms, and predictors of infections
and infectious deaths should hold true for other trials as
well. Furthermore, many of the elements within CCG
2891 are used in many AML trials, including anthracycline-based cycles and the use of high-dose, often intensively timed cytarabine, thus emphasizing the rationale for
carefully examining the risk of infections during phase 2
chemotherapy in this report. Furthermore, this report is
important because we have very little knowledge about
risk factors for infection from randomized studies. Almost
1106

all of our knowledge is based on observational studies,
which may be difficult to interpret because of potential
biases and confounders. Given our findings, we believe
that prevention of invasive fungal infections should be a
priority, because more than a quarter of children during
intensive timing induction had a microbiologically documented infection. Second, prevention of invasive viral
infections also is important, because the risk increases
with intensity of therapy. Third, initial efforts to reduce
infections in patient with AML should be targeted at
chemotherapy recipients in addition to SCT recipients,
because those receiving chemotherapy are at higher risk of
such infections compared with those undergoing allogeneic SCT.
Our study has important limitations. For example,
we do not know whether children received antibacterial
prophylaxis (in addition to cotrimoxazole) and if so, what
type of prophylaxis they received. Patients who receive

infections with older children may in fact reflect an association between adverse outcomes and obesity. Finally, the
use of a specific form to collect information was newly
introduced for this study, and thus we may have underestimated the prevalence of infections if some infections
were not reported using this form.
In conclusion, the prevalence of infection varies
depending on the type of treatment, with the highest risk
of infections being associated with intensive timing induction and chemotherapy consolidation. These findings
provide insight into the mechanisms behind susceptibility
to infections in pediatric AML.
