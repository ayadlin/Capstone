ABSTRACT
Manipulation of metabolic pathways in hematological cancers has therapeutic
potential. Here, we determined the molecular mechanism of action of the metabolic
modulator dichloroacetate (DCA) in leukemic cells. We found that DCA induces the
AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK)/p53 pathway with increased efficacy in tumors
expressing wild type (wt p53). Clinically relevant, low concentrations of doxorubicin
synergize in vitro and in vivo with DCA to further enhance p53 activation and to block
tumor progression. Leukemia cell lines and primary leukemic cells containing mutant p53
are resistant to the above-described combination approach. However, DCA synergized
with the Hsp90 inhibitor 17-AAG to specifically eliminate these cells. Our studies
strongly indicate that depending on the p53 status, different combination therapies
would provide better treatment with decreased side effects in hematological cancers.

pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 1 (PDK1), can shift cellular
metabolism from glycolysis to glucose oxidation in a variety
of cell lines, including leukemic cells [6]. PDK1 inhibition
activates pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH), a key regulator
of glucose oxidation metabolism, causing a reduction in
lactate production and an increase in OXPHOS. DCA has
been used in medicine for over 30 years to treat metabolic
disorders, including lactic acidosis [7, 8]. Furthermore, DCA
has shown clinical efficacy for the treatment of glioblastoma
[9] and complete remission of a patient with non-Hodgkin’s
lymphoma was reported after self-administration of DCA
[10]. However, the mechanisms responsible for DCA-induced
tumor regression have not been clearly elucidated and the
effect of DCA in different tumors is still controversial [10–16].
The tumor suppressor gene p53 is emerging as
an important regulator of metabolic homeostasis. It

INTRODUCTION
Hematological malignancies, such as leukemia,
lymphoma and myeloma, affect blood, bone marrow
and lymph nodes. Although recent treatments have
significantly improved patient survival, many patients
will not respond to treatment or will develop resistance.
Therefore, novel therapeutic approaches are required [1].
Most cancer cells use elevated amount of glucose
for anabolic reactions and generate ATP through aerobic
glycolysis rather than via mitochondrial oxidative
phosphorylation (OXPHOS). This specific tumor cell
metabolism, which is called the Warburg effect [2], provides
growth advantages besides its role in anabolism [3] and is
also observed in leukemic cells of different origins [4, 5].

their side effects. We also found that associating
17-Allylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin (17-AAG),
a heat-shock protein (HSP) 90 inhibitor, with DCA
potentiates the apoptotic effect in leukemic cell lines
and primary tumor cells with mutant p53. Therefore,
this study provides two protocols for DCA-based
combinational therapy in hematological cancers based
on their p53 status.

promotes OXPHOS and inhibits glycolysis and thus
might hinder the Warburg effect in many cancers [17].
p53 stimulates metabolism by inducing the expression of
different metabolic genes, such as cytochrome c oxidase
2 (SCO2), glutaminase 2 (GLS2), p53 up-regulated
modulator of apoptosis (PUMA), glucose transporter
1 and 4 (GLUT1 and GLUT4) and TP53-induced
glycolysis and apoptosis regulator (TIGAR) [18]. p53
also increases AMPKβ1 and AMPKβ2 gene expression,
reinforcing the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK)
response [19]. AMPK, the main metabolic cell sensor,
is activated in conditions of energetic stress that deplete
the cell ATP supplies, such as nutrient deprivation,
or in response to oxidative stress caused by hypoxia
[20]. AMPK also phosphorylates and stimulates p53
transcriptional activity to initiate a metabolic cell cycle
checkpoint [21]. Their mutual regulation enhances their
tumor suppressive functions.
More than half of all human tumors harbor
mutations in the p53 gene that abrogate its DNA binding
and transactivation activity [22]. Substantial evidence
indicates that mutant p53 gain-of-function activity is
dependent on its de novo ability to activate gene expression
[23, 24]. Recently, it has been shown that mutant p53 can
bind to the AMPKα subunit and inhibit AMPK signaling
in head and neck cancer cells [25]. In hematological
malignancies, p53 mutations are less frequent (10–15%)
than in solid tumors, but are strongly associated with
poor survival, refractory disease and chemo-resistance
[26–29]. Moreover, p53 mutation rate increases during
disease progression and also in response to chemotherapy.
There is growing interest in the role of mutant p53 in
tumor invasion and metabolism because it can promote
tumor cell proliferation and might suppress other activities
of wild type (wt) p53, such as cell respiration and antioxidant response.
Hence, targeting cell metabolism, for instance with
DCA, could be a new promising strategy for treating
hematological cancers [1]. DCA effects in B-chronic
lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL) depend on p53 status
[30, 31], probably because DCA activates p53 at posttranscriptional levels [31]. DCA also exhibits toxicity
against B-CLL cells lacking wt p53 [30]. However,
how DCA activates wt p53 is unknown. Here, we
show that targeting tumor metabolism using DCA
could be a new effective approach for the treatment
of several hematological cancers and that its efficacy
depends on the tumor p53 status. DCA, through
AMPK phosphorylation, increases p53 transcriptional
activity and leads to p53-dependent G1 cell cycle arrest.
Moreover, p53 activates AMPK through a positive
feedback loop. We also show that combination of
DCA with genotoxic drugs, such as doxorubicin and
vincristine, can greatly improve DCA effectiveness by
further promoting activation of wt p53. This could allow
reducing the concentration of these drugs to minimize

RESULTS
DCA promotes p53 transcriptional activity and
causes cell cycle arrest in a p53-dependent manner
We previously showed that DCA, a small molecule
that inhibits PDK1 (a key regulator of the Warburg
effect), blocks aerobic glycolysis in leukemia cells
[6]. Here, we examined DCA effect on growth and
viability of three acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cell
lines (MOLM13, NB4 and HL60) and in two multiple
myeloma (MM) cell lines (MM1.S and U266) with
different p53 status (Supplementary Table S1). After
48 hours of incubation with increasing concentrations
of DCA, the number of cells was significantly reduced,
in a dose-dependent manner, in MOLM13 and MM1.S
cells (wt p53), but not in U266 cells (mutant p53) or
in HL60 cells, in which p53 was genetically ablated
(p53−/−). In NB4 cells (mutant p53), the cell number
was reduced only upon incubation with the highest
DCA concentration. Cell viability was not inhibited in
any of the cell lines under study (Figure 1A). We next
investigated DCA effect on the cell cycle by incubating
the three AML cell lines with 20 mM DCA for 48 hours.
Cell cycle distribution analysis showed that following
DCA treatment, the proportion of MOLM13 cells
(wt p53) in G1 was increased and the percentage of
cells in S phase was reduced compared to untreated
cells (Figure 1B). Conversely, in NB4 and HL60 cells
progression to S phase was not suppressed by DCA.
These results indicate that DCA induces G1 cell cycle
arrest and blocks cell proliferation in a p53-dependent
manner. Accordingly, DCA induced p53 transcriptional
activity only in MOLM13 cells (Figure 1C), leading to
up-regulation of p53 target genes involved in cell cycle
arrest (p21), regulation of p53 activity (MDM2) and
regulation of metabolism (GLS2 and AMPKβ1). Lower
DCA concentration (1–5 mM) could also increase Mdm2
and GLS2 mRNA levels, however we found that high
concentration of DCA (10–20 mM) are required to induce
a robust p53 response in AML cell lines (Supplementary
Figure S1). In summary, in AML cells harboring wt p53,
DCA activates p53 transcriptional activity, leading to p21
up-regulation and cell proliferation inhibition. Moreover,
the increased expression of metabolic regulators, such as
GLS2 and AMPKβ, indicates that DCA also activates the
p53-regulated metabolic response.

p53 is activated by AMPK in response to
DCA treatment

fluorescence, but the increase was higher in MOLM13
cells (Supplementary Figure S3A). AMPK-mediated
activation of p53 should contribute to the cell anti-oxidant
defenses by inducing the expression of several genes
involved in the anti-oxidant response, such as GLS2
[37–39]. Indeed, DCA incubation led to GLS2 mRNA
up-regulation only in MOLM13 cells (wt p53), but not
in p53 mutant cell lines (Figure 1C). These data suggest
that DCA-induced ROS production could be responsible
for the activation of the AMPK/p53 pathway. To verify
this hypothesis, we analyzed the effect of blocking
ROS production by N-acetyl cysteine (NAC) on DCAinduced AMPK/p53 pathway (Supplementary Figure
S3B). NAC treatment completely reversed DCA-induced
ROS production and significantly attenuated DCAinduced p53 transcription activity (Supplementary Figure
S3C). Moreover, western blot analysis indicated that
DCA-induced phosphorylation of p53 (S46), AMPK and
ACC was reduced or abrogated by NAC (Supplementary
Figure S3D).
To further investigate whether DCA induces
p53 activation via AMPK, we silenced AMPKα1 in
MOLM13 and p53+/+ HCT116 cells using two specific
siRNAs. AMPKα1 down-regulation reduced DCAinduced ACC phosphorylation and p53 phosphorylation
at S46 (Figure 2E and 3D). Moreover, it inhibited p53
transcriptional activity in both cell lines (Figure 2D
and 3D). These data indicate that DCA induces p53
phosphorylation at S46 and p53 transcriptional activity
via AMPK activation. Therefore, in order to confirm
the essential role of p53 on DCA-mediated inhibition
of proliferation, we utilized siRNA to attenuate p53
expression in p53+/+ HCT116 cells (Supplementary Figure
S4A and S4B). The knockdown of p53 expression was
demonstrated by quantitative RT-PCR (Supplementary
Figure S4B). Knockdown of p53 abrogates the effect of
DCA on proliferation (Supplementary Figure S4A) and
transcription (Supplementary Figure S4B). All these
results demonstrate that wt p53 is critical for DCAinduced inhibition of cell proliferation.

These data are consistent with previous studies in
solid tumors showing that DCA activates the p53 pathway
[9, 31, 32]; however, the underlying mechanism is unclear.
As activation of AMPK, the main cellular metabolic sensor,
leads to p53 up-regulation and G1 cell cycle arrest [21], we
asked whether AMPK could be involved in DCA effects
in wt p53 AML cells. Similarly to the AMPK activator
metformin [33, 34], DCA increased phosphorylation
of AMPKα at the activating residue T172 and also
phosphorylation, and thus inactivation, of acetyl-coA
carboxylase (ACC), the main AMPK substrate (Figure 2A).
ACC phosphorylation was significantly higher in MOLM13
cells (wt p53), than in NB4 (mutant p53) and HL60 (p53−/−)
cells (Figure 2B). In the MM cell lines, we also observed
a significant increase of ACC phosphorylation in MM1.S
(wt p53) compared to U266 (mutant p53) at 10 and 20 mM
DCA concentrations (Supplementary Figure S2A and S2B).
Moreover no increase in p53 and p21 protein levels was
detected in U266 in contrast to MM1.S (Supplementary
Figure S2A and S2B).
Activated AMPKα phosphorylates p53, but the
sites of this phosphorylation are unknown [21, 35]. DCA
reproducibly increased p53 expression and promoted p53
phosphorylation at S46 (Figure 2a and Supplementary
Figure S2) and S15 (Figure 2C). Moreover, time course
analysis of the effects of 20 mM DCA indicated that p53
phosphorylation at S46 preceded phosphorylation at S15
in MOLM13 cells (Figure 2C).
The different results obtained using wt and mutant
p53 AML and MM cell lines could be due to their
different genetic background. However, similar results
were obtained also using two isogenic colon cancer cell
lines (p53+/+ and p53−/− HCT116 cells) (Figure 3A). DCA
induced higher ACC phosphorylation in p53+/+ than in
p53−/− HCT116 cells (4.75- and 1.49-fold, respectively;
Figure 3A and 3B). Low DCA concentrations induced
p53 phosphorylation on S46, whereas relatively higher
doses were required to detected p53 phosphorylation at
S15 in p53+/+ HCT116 cells (Figure 3A). Moreover, DCA
inhibited proliferation of p53+/+ but not of p53−/− HCT116
cells (Figure 3C). Finally, DCA-induced AMPKβ upregulation was p53-dependent (Figure 3A), as observed
for the mRNA expression (Figure 1).
As DCA promotes reactive oxygen species (ROS)
production [16] and an increase in intracellular ROS levels
might activate AMPK [20], we measured ROS production
in AML cells before and after incubation with DCA. Both
NB4 (p53 mutant) and HL60 (p53−/−) cells had higher basal
ROS levels than MOLM13 (wt p53) cells (Supplementary
Figure S3A, upper panels), possibly due to the lack of p53
anti-oxidant function [36]. DCA treatment stimulated ROS
production in a time-dependent manner in all AML cell
lines, as determined by quantification of CM-H2DCFDA

OXPHOS activates AMPK
DCA is a metabolic drug that inhibits aerobic
glycolysis (the Warburg effect) and favors the oxidation
of pyruvate in mitochondria, fueling OXPHOS. When
glucose is no longer available, cells use alternative energy
substrates, such as glutamine (Gln). Gln oxidation, or
glutaminolysis, generates ATP through OXPHOS and
this pathway is functional in leukemic cells [40, 41]. We
thus asked whether culturing cells in OXPHOS medium
(glucose-free medium supplemented with galactose and
Gln [6, 40, 41]) would have similar effects as DCA on cell
proliferation and AMPK activation. DCA and OXPHOS
medium both blocked lactate production, the end-product
of aerobic glycolysis, as indicated by the decrease in

acidification of the culture medium (Figure 4A). The
reduction in lactate production by DCA is the result of
PDK inactivation and Pyruvate Dehydrogenase (PDH)
activation and shows that DCA-mediated PDK inhibition
is effective in the three AML cell lines. DCA had no effect
on oxygen consumption in NB4 and HL60 cells, while
it caused a decrease in MOLM13 cells (Supplementary
Figure S4C). This indicated that the primary effect of DCA
treatment is not a stimulation of oxygen consumption but
more a reduction of lactate production. An explanation
to the selective effect in MOLM13 cells could be that
they stop proliferate and need much less ATP, thereby
decreasing oxygen consumption. Indeed, both DCA and
OXPHOS medium decreased proliferation in wt p53
MOLM13 cells, but not in p53 mutant NB4 or p53−/−
HL60 cells (Figure 4D), indicating that this effect is
p53-dependent. Conversely, OXPHOS medium induced
AMPK phosphorylation and activation in MOLM13 cells
(Figure 4C and 4D). In addition, OXPHOS medium also
induced p53 phosphorylation at S46 (Figure 4C) and p53dependent increase in AMPKβ1 transcription (Figure 4E).
These data suggest that the metabolic change from
glycolysis to OXPHOS following incubation with DCA is
responsible for the activation of the AMPK/p53 pathway.

also stimulated tumor cell metabolism by promoting the
expression of AMPKβ1, GLS2 and SCO2.

DCA synergizes with the chemotherapeutic
drugs doxorubicin and vincristine
Many chemotherapeutic drugs currently used in
the clinic activate the p53 pathway, but also cause DNA
damage and many side effects. Combination therapy is a
strategy based on the use of multiple chemotherapeutic
drugs to efficiently activate p53 with reduced genotoxic
effects.
We thus tested in leukemic cell lines and primary
leukemic cells the anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic
effects of DCA alone or in combination with the
chemotherapeutic agents doxorubicin and vincristine.
In the AML and MM cell lines harboring wt p53
(MOLM13 and MM1.S), co-treatment with DCA and
low doses of doxorubicin or vincristine further reduced
the number of leukemic cells in comparison to each
drug alone (Supplementary Figure S6A). Conversely,
in p53 mutant and p53−/− cell lines both single-drug
and combination treatments had little effect on the cell
number (Supplementary Figure S6A). Overnight pretreatment with DCA followed by doxorubicin induced
apoptosis in MOLM13 cells (wt p53), but not in NB4
cells (mutant p53) (Supplementary Figure S6B). Similarly,
the combined treatment was more effective in reducing
tumor cell viability in primary leukemic samples obtained
from patients with B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia
(B-CLL) and B cell lymphoma harboring wt p53 than
each single drug (Figure 6A). Co-treatment led to higher
accumulation of p53 and of its transcriptional target p21,
which controls cell cycle progression (Figure 6B and
Supplementary Figure S7A), and also to significantly
stronger induction of the pro-apoptotic p53 target gene
PUMA (Figure 6C and Supplementary Figure S7B). These
results show that combination of DCA with non-toxic
doses of genotoxic agents could be an approach to induce
apoptosis in wt p53 tumor cells.
To test this in vivo, we engrafted wt p53 human
AML primary cells in non-obese diabetic/severe combined
immunodeficient (NOD/SCID)-interleukin-2 receptor
γ null (NSG) mice following our previous protocol [42,
43]. Mice with established tumors (day 80 post-graft)
were treated with low doses of doxorubicin, DCA or both
(Figure 6d and 6e). These treatments were not toxic in
non-grafted mice (data not shown). Doxorubicin treatment
reduced the proliferation of human AML cells compared
to untreated mice (control) only during the first 20 days
after the beginning of treatment. Indeed, this effect was
not detected at day 120 post-graft (i.e., 40 day after
the beginning of treatment). DCA alone did not show
any effect. Co-treatment with DCA and doxorubicin
significantly delayed tumor progression and the number of
circulating human AML cells was still significantly lower

DCA decreases tumor progression in
primary leukemic cells
We then validated our results using peripheral blood
and bone marrow samples from patients with different
hematological malignancies (Supplementary Table S1).
First, we used primary tumor cells from a patient with
B-cell lymphoma (BCL) (wt p53) that actively proliferate
in vitro (Patient 2). Alike MOLM13 cells, incubation
with DCA for 48 h induced cell cycle arrest in G1 in a
dose-dependent manner (Supplementary Figure S5A).
In addition, DCA did not inhibit tumor cell viability
(Supplementary Figure S5B). Analysis of tumor cells from
31 patients with different hematological malignancies
harboring wt p53 (Supplementary Table S1) confirmed
that incubation with DCA caused minor effects on cell
viability, similar to what observed in CD3+ T cells from
healthy donors (Supplementary Figure S5C).
We then examined p53 protein levels and
transcriptional activity following DCA incubation in
samples from MM, BCL and B-CLL patients (Figure 5).
We chose patients with high percentage of tumor blasts,
which allowed biochemical studies of rather homogenous
cell populations. Expression of p53 protein was increased
only in samples from patients harboring wt p53, but
not mutant p53 (Figure 5A). Similarly, DCA induced
AMPKβ1 mRNA expression (Figure 5B) and up-regulation
of the p53 target genes MDM2, p21, GLS2 and SCO2
(Figure 5B) only in patients’ tumor samples expressing wt
p53. Therefore, in these patient samples, in addition to the
induction of genes related to cell cycle arrest (p21), DCA

and our results support the finding that p53 activation by
metabolic stress is activated by AMPK [49]. Hence, AMPK
activation is required for p53-mediated growth suppression
and metabolic adaptation in response to DCA treatment.
Forcing leukemic cells to perform OXPHOS by
glucose deprivation and causing glutaminolysis have
similar effects as DCA treatment. Based on this result,
we suggest that the activation of the AMPK/p53 pathway
by DCA is the consequence of a metabolic change from
aerobic glycolysis to OXPHOS. This could be clinically
relevant because other drugs with similar metabolic effects
as DCA could elicit their effects through the mechanism
described in this study [1, 3]. Activation of p53 by DCA
not only promotes cell cycle arrest, but could also cause
further inhibition of glycolysis. Recent studies have shown
that p53 can stimulate energy metabolism of cells through
the activation of genes, such as GLS2 [38, 50] and SCO2
[51]. SCO2 is an essential regulator of the cytochrome
c oxidase complex (mitochondria complex IV) and
is induced by p53 to increase OXPHOS [51]. GLS2
stimulates oxidative energy metabolism by increasing
α-ketoglutarate production, mitochondrial respiration and
linked ATP generation. It has been proposed that GLS2
could also inhibit tumor cell growth, thus contributing
to p53 tumor suppressor role [38, 50]. In addition, GLS2
has an anti-oxidant function by decreasing ROS levels
to protect cells from oxidative stress and death [38].
DCA promotes mitochondrial OXPHOS, which is the
main source of endogenous ROS in the cells. ROS also
promotes AMPK phosphorylation and activation [20].
We demonstrated that ROS generated by OXPHOS are,
at least partially, responsible for the activation of the
AMPK/p53 pathway (Figure 8). ROS-mediated p53
activation could then induce the anti-oxidant response
through GLS2 expression up-regulation. Furthermore, loss
of p53 or the presence of mutant p53 is associated with
increased intracellular ROS production that contributes to
accelerate tumor progression [38, 39]. This could explain
the observed high basal ROS level in p53−/− and especially
in mutant p53 cell lines compared to wt p53 cell lines.
However, we do not rule out that other mechanisms could
contribute to AMPK activation, such as the increase of the
AMP/ATP ratio in response to glycolysis inhibition [52].
For our study, we have used DCA concentrations
similar to other groups; however the clinical concentration
in DCA-treated patient is unclear. The half-life of DCA is
<1 hour: it is not detectable in patients during the initial
treatments that can last the first 2 to 3 months [8, 9]. DCA
inhibits its own metabolism and serum concentrations
increase, eventually reaching a plateau, with plasma
concentrations around 0.3 mM [8]. Michelakis et al gave
50 mg/Kg/day of DCA to patients and obtained similar
values 0.44 ± 0.16 mM [9]. On average this could give
a DCA blood concentration of 5 mM. However, the
ultimate destination of the DCA that was not in blood
was unknown. In this manuscript we have observed that
DCA concentrations of 1 mM can induce some metabolic

compared to control at day 120 post-graft (Figure 6D and
6E). However, sixty days after the beginning of treatment
(day 140 post-graft), when mice were sacrificed, we did
not observe any difference between groups. Our results
show that low doses of DCA and doxorubicin cooperate in
blocking proliferation of human AML cells in vivo.

Synergistic effect of DCA with 17-AAG
Mutations in p53 are correlated with increased drug
resistance of tumor cells, making difficult to eliminate
them. In addition, mutant p53 possess oncogenic gain of
function activities involved in tumor progression, metastasis
and metabolism [23, 25, 44]. These tumors must be treated
using drugs that specifically inhibit mutant p53. The levels
of mutant p53 in several cancer cell lines are high due to its
binding to HSP90 that protects mutant p53 from MDM2mediated ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation. 17AAG is an HSP90 inhibitor that promotes degradation of
mutant p53 [45] with reported efficacy in primary leukemia
cells from patients with MM, AML and chronic lymphocytic
leukemia (CLL) [46]. We first compared its effect on viability
of several MM and AML cell lines with different p53 status,
but not in MOLM13 cells as they are very sensitive to 17AAG due to FLT3 expression [47, 48]. Incubation with 17AAG for 24 h decreased cell viability particularly in U266
and NB4 cells that harbor mutant p53 (Figure 7A). Moreover,
HSP90 inhibition by 17-AAG decreased p53 protein levels in
U266 and NB4 cells (Figure 7A, bottom panels), but had no
effect in MM1.S cells (wt p53). To decrease 17-AAG toxicity,
we then investigated the effect of associating 17-AAG at low
concentration with DCA. Like with 17-AAG alone, this drug
combination decreased p53 protein level only in leukemic
cell lines harboring mutant p53 (U266 and NB4) (Figure 7B).
However, lower 17-AAG concentrations were required when
used in combination with DCA. Similar results were obtained
using primary leukemic cells from two patients with BCL
harboring mutant p53 (Figure 7C). Finally, cell numbers and
viability were both significantly reduced in primary leukemic
cells from three patients with B-CLL harboring mutant p53
upon co-incubation with 17-AAG and DCA (Figure 7D). Cell
death, caused probably by apoptosis, was increased in tumor
cell lines expressing mutant p53 (Figure 7E).

DISCUSSION
Here, we show that DCA efficacy in several hemato­
logical cancers depends on their p53 status. Targeting tumor
cell metabolism with DCA leads to p53 accumulation,
increase in p53 transcriptional activity and p53-dependent
accumulation of cells in G1 phase only in leukemic cell lines
and primary leukemic cells harboring wt p53 (Figure 8).
DCA induces p53 phosphorylation through AMPK,
thus enhancing p53 effects on cell proliferation and
metabolism. In addition, p53 increases transcription of
AMPKβ, the regulatory subunit of AMPK. The AMPK/p53
positive feedback loop was previously described [19, 21]

Figure 8: Diagram describing the mechanism of how DCA efficacy depends on p53 status. A. DCA activates AMPK/
p53 pathway in response to oxidative stress. Wt p53 is phosphorylated and transcriptional activated by AMPKα leading to G1 cell cycle
arrest and inhibition of glycolysis. p53 also increases AMPKβ gene expression, reinforcing the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK)
response. B. DCA doesn’t stop proliferation in absence of p53 or presence or mtp53. mtp53 gain of functions could be involved in tumour
progression, drug resistance and inhibition of certain genes such as AMPK.
responses but not all. Consistent results were obtained with
concentrations between 5 and 20 mM. But it is important to
note that we treat cells for shorter periods of times (3 days)
than those used in clinic that can last several months or even
years. Hence, without knowing where the DCA is in vivo
and the half-life in vitro we can not compare both situations.
We found that DCA mainly inhibit proliferation rather
than inducing apoptosis in tumors with wt p53. This is in
agreement with results in other cell lines in which analysis
of cells incubated with DCA did not highlight induction of
apoptosis [16]. DCA did not have a significant effect on the
proliferation of cell lines or primary cells with mutant p53
or lacking p53, although we observed (data not shown) that
higher DCA doses and longer incubation times induced cell
death in p53−/− cells, as previously described [16].
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

At high doses DCA can induce neurological
complications in humans [14]. To avoid these toxic
effects, we propose to associate DCA with standard, antileukemic drugs, such as doxorubicin and vincristine.
These drugs are widely used to treat lymphoma, myeloma
and leukemia. Unfortunately, many tumors are resistant
or become resistant to these drugs, leading to treatment
failure or relapse. We found that extremely low, non-toxic
concentrations of doxorubicin and vincristine synergized
in vitro with DCA to reduce viability of primary leukemic
cells. Our results show that these drug combinations are
optimal to induce p53 accumulation and p53-dependent cell
cycle arrest and apoptosis. In addition, our results show that
DCA and doxorubicin synergize to inhibit proliferation of
human p53+/+ AML cells in vivo. However, this is transitory

Cancer Research (FIRC), Institute of Molecular Oncology
(Milan, Italy). All animal experiments were carried out
in accordance with national and international laws and
policies. For induction of acute leukemia in mice, 1 million
AML cells were injected intravenously (i.v.) through the
lateral tail vein in non-irradiated mice. At day 80, when
human cells reached 1% in blood, mice were separated in
four groups of four mice: control, doxorubicin (1.5 mg/kg,
3 doses i.v. from day 5 to day 7), DCA (50 mg/kg, 1 dose/
day by gavage, starting at day 1 for 16 consecutive days)
and DCA+doxorubicin as described above. At days 100,
120 and 140 post-graft, peripheral blood was collected from
the tail vein and the percentage of human AML cells was
analyzed by flow cytometry, as previously described [42].

and additional experiments with longer incubation times are
required to determine whether this treatment can effectively
and durably block tumor progression.
Conversely, all tumor cell samples from patients
with mutant p53 (n = 4) were resistant to DCA alone or
in combination with genotoxic drugs, suggesting that
the response to this treatment could be associated with
the tumor p53 status. In these patient samples and in p53
mutant cell lines, co-treatment with DCA and 17-AAG
was clearly more effective in inducing apoptosis than
single-drug treatments. 17-AAG promotes mutant p53
degradation by the ubiquitin proteasome pathway [45]. The
combination of 17-AAG and DCA strongly reduced p53
protein levels in p53 mutant cells and increased apoptosis
of tumor cells. At the present, it remains unclear how DCA
and 17-AAG synergize to reduce mutant p53 protein level.
Further studies are necessary to elucidate this effect.
Mutations in p53 are not equivalent to p53 loss.
Mutant p53 acquires new functions to drive tumor cell
migration, invasion and metastasis formation [53] and it
may also have opposite functions to wt p53 in the control
of metabolism. For instance, mutant p53 promotes aerobic
glycolysis by induction of type II hexokinase (HK2) gene
expression [54]. Our data suggest that mutant p53 may
limit the efficacy of DCA in blocking tumor progression
and are consistent with recent studies showing that mutant
p53 promotes cancer cell growth and metabolism by
inhibiting AMPK activation [25]. This provides a possible
mechanism for the observed resistance of mutant p53
tumor cells to DCA treatment. By promoting mutant
p53 degradation with the HSP90 inhibitor 17-AAG we
can increase DCA potency as a cancer therapeutic drug.
And vice versa, DCA can facilitate the clinical use of
17-AAG by decreasing the required concentrations and
consequently its side effects. This is clinically relevant
because, in hematological malignancies, p53 mutation
frequency increases with tumor progression to more
aggressive or advanced stages and it is strongly associated
with chemo-resistance and poor prognosis [26–29, 55].
In summary, we provide a new mechanism of action
of DCA through the AMPK/p53 pathway and provide
the proof of principle and the proof of mechanism that
depending on the p53 status, different combinatorial
therapies that include metabolic drugs, such as DCA,
will provide better treatment with decreased side effects.
Furthermore, our finding that suppressing mutant p53
could specifically induce apoptosis in hematological
cancers carrying p53 mutations, offers a potential new
therapeutic approach in relapsed patients.

Cell cultures
AML (MOLM13, NB4 and HL60) and MM (MM1.S
and U266) cell lines were cultured as previously described
[41]. MOLM13 and HL60 cells were kindly provided by
Dr. Bossis from the IGMM institute (Montpellier, France).
MOLM13 and MM1.S cells harbor wt p53, NB4 and U266
cells carry mutant p53 (R248Q and A161T, respectively)
and HL60 is a p53−/− cell line. p53+/+ and p53−/− HCT116
cells were cultured in low glucose (5 mM) DMEM
medium supplemented with 10% FBS. Bone marrow and
peripheral blood samples were obtained from patients
with different hematological diseases and healthy donors
after informed consent. Cells were purified by FicollHypaque (Sigma) density-gradient centrifugation. Primary
cells were seeded in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented
with 10% FBS, containing 10 ng/ml IL-6 for MM
(CD38+CD138+), 10 ng/ml IL-10 for BCL (CD5+CD19+)
or nothing for B-CLL (CD19+CD20+) samples. Cells were
grown at 37°C and 5% CO2 in a humidified atmosphere.
In summary all samples were grown in the approximately
physiological glucose concentration of 5 mM.

Reagents, siRNAs and transfection
DCA was purchased from Santa Cruz, 17-AAG was
from Selleck, doxorubicin and vincristine were obtained
through the University Hospital of Montpellier (CHU
Montpellier). All siRNA duplexes used for AMPKα1
knockdown were ON-TARGETplus modified siRNAs
(Dharmacon). p53 siRNA was a gift from Dr Xirodimas
and it was ON-TARGETplus SMARTpools (mixture of 4
siRNA) from Dharmacon. In HCT116 cells, transfection
of 30–50 nM siRNAs was carried out using Lipofectamine
RNAiMAX (Invitrogen) in Opti-MEM (Invitrogen),
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. MOLM13
cells (2 × 106 in 100 μl) were transfected with 300 nM
AMPKα1 siRNA, or control siRNA by electroporation
using the Gene Pulser Xcell™ Electroporation system
(Bio-Rad). Cells were harvested 24 to 72 h posttransfection.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
In vivo mouse experiments
In vivo experiments were carried out using 6 to
8 weeks/old NSG mice. Mice were bred and housed in
pathogen-free conditions in the animal facility of the

(Millipore) or using the Supersignal West Dura extended
duration substrate (Pierce). Chemiluminescent detection
was carried out using the Molecular Imager Gel Doc
XRS system (Bio-Rad). Band quantification was
performed using the Image lab software (Bio-Rad).
The P-ACC/ACC ratio is calculated by given the value
of 1 to untreated cells for each independent cell line
and reporting to this value the P-ACC/ACC ratio in
stimulated cells.

Cell viability and cell numbers were determined
using the Muse® Cell Analyzer (Millipore) or the trypan
blue exclusion method, as indicated. Analysis of apoptotic
cells (Annexin V assay) was performed using the Muse®
Cell Analyzer. In some experiments cells were incubated
in RPMI 1640 without glucose and supplemented with
10 mM galactose and glutamine (final concentration: 4 or
6 mM) to force cells to perform OXPHOS [40, 56].
Cell cycle analysis was performed using the Click-iT
EdU flow cytometry assay kit (Invitrogen, Molecular Probes).
For ROS detection, cells were incubated in PBS containing
10 μM DCFH2-DA or CellROX® Deep Red Reagent
(Invitrogen, Molecular Probes) for 30 min, and then washed
with PBS and immediately analyzed by flow cytometry.
The viability of primary tumor cells was
determined using the fluorescent marker 7-aminoactinomycin D (7-AAD) (Beckman). Different antibodies
(Beckman) against surface markers were used to identify
tumor cells: anti-CD5-PB, -CD19-PE and -CD20AlexaFluor750 for cells from patients with B-CLL, antiCD38-PE-Cy5.5 and -CD138-APC for cells from patients
with MM, anti-CD14-FITC, -CD33-APC and -CD34-PE
for cells from patients with AML, anti-CD33-APC and
CD34-PE for cells from patients with myelodysplastic
syndrome (MDS), anti-CD10-APCAlexaFluor750,
-CD19-PE or -CD19-PE and -CD20-AlexaFluor750 for
cells from patients with B-cell lymphoma, and anti-CD3APC for T lymphocytes from healthy donors. 1 × 106
cells were incubated with the corresponding antibodies
in PBS supplemented with 2.5% FBS at 37°C for
20–30 minutes. Cells were then washed, resuspended in
200–250 μl PBS with 2.5% FBS and analyzed using a
Gallios™ flow cytometer (Beckman Coulter). Data were
analyzed with the Kaluza software.
Number of cells means number of live cells and
viability is the number of live cells counted divided by
total cell counted (alive and dead cells). A decrease of
number of live cells could be due to a cell cycle arrest
and/or a decrease of viability. A decrease in viability is due
to an increase of cell death (e.g., apoptosis or necrosis).

RT-PCR and DNA sequencing
Total RNA was extracted using NucleoSpin
RNA isolation columns (Macherey-Nagel), reverse
transcription was carried out using random primers.
Quantitative PCR was performed as described
previously [57] with SsoADV SYBR Green qPCR
SuperMix (Biorad) and a CFX Connect™ Real-Time
qPCR machine (Biorad) with AMPKα1, AMPKβ1,
GLS2, MDM2 (P2), p21, SCO2 and actin primers.
All samples were normalized to β-actin mRNA levels.
Primer sequences are listed in Supplementary Materials
and Methods. p21, GLS2 and PUMA primers were
previously described [50]. For p53 sequencing, 1 μg of
RNA was reverse-transcribed using random primers.
One twentieth of the cDNA was amplified by nested
PCR using the appropriate primers [58]. PCR products
were separated on agarose gels. The major bands were
excised and sequenced. To determine the tumor p53
status, the entire open reading frame was sequenced
by Eurofins MWG Operon with the primers E67F (5′
-TTGCGTGTGGAGTATTTGGAT-3′) and MP9ER
(5′-TCTCCCAGGACAGCACAAACACG-3′).

Oxygen consumption
Mitochondrial oxygen consumption assays were
performed using the high-resolution respirometry system
Oxygraph-2k (Oroboros, Austria) as described previously
[59].

Statistical analysis
Statistical analysis was performed using the
Student’s t test: *p < 0.05; **p < 0.01; ***p < 0.001.
Values were expressed as the mean ± the standard error of
the mean (SEM).

Western blot analysis
Primary antibodies against phospho-AMPKα
(Thr172), AMPKα, AMPKβ, phospho-ACC (Ser79),
ACC, phospho-p53 (S15 and S46), p21 (12D1) and
β-actin were from Cell Signaling Technology. The
anti-p53 antibody (DO-1) was a gift from Dr Xirodimas.
Cell extracts were lysed in 2 × SDS sample buffer.
Proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to
nitrocellulose or PVDF membranes using the Trans-Blot®
Turbo™ Transfer System (Bio-Rad). Peroxidase-coupled
anti-mouse and anti-rabbit secondary antibodies were
used at a dilution of 1:10, 000 (Sigma). Bound antibodies
were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence
