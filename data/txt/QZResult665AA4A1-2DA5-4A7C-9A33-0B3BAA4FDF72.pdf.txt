Abstract
Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) infections are seen often in glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) tumors, but
whether the virus contributes to GBM pathogenesis is unclear. In this study, we explored an oncogenic role for the
G-protein–coupled receptor-like protein US28 encoded by HCMV that we found to be expressed widely in human
GBMs. Immunohistochemical and reverse transcriptase PCR approaches established that US28 was expressed in
approximately 60% of human GBM tissues and primary cultures examined. In either uninfected GBM cells or
neural progenitor cells, thought to be the GBM precursor cells, HCMV infection or US28 overexpression was
sufﬁcient to promote secretion of biologically active VEGF and to activate multiple cellular kinases that promote
glioma growth and invasion, including phosphorylated STAT3 (p-STAT3) and endothelial nitric oxide synthase
(e-NOS). Consistent with these ﬁndings, US28 overexpression increased primary GBM cell invasion in Matrigel.
Notably, this invasive phenotype was further enhanced by exposure to CCL5/RANTES, a US28 ligand, associated
with poor patient outcome in GBM. Conversely, RNA interference–mediated knockdown of US28 in human
glioma cells persistently infected with HCMV led to an inhibition in VEGF expression and glioma cell invasion in
response to CCL5 stimulation. Analysis of clinical GBM specimens further revealed that US28 colocalized in situ
with several markers of angiogenesis and inﬂammation, including VEGF, p-STAT3, COX2, and e-NOS. Taken
together, our results indicate that US28 expression from HCMV contributes to GBM pathogenesis by inducing an
invasive, angiogenic phenotype. In addition, these ﬁndings argue that US28–CCL5 paracrine signaling may
contribute to glioma progression and suggest that targeting US28 may provide therapeutic beneﬁts in GBM
treatment. Cancer Res; 71(21); 6643–53. 2011 AACR.

Introduction
Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is a beta-herpesvirus that
can cause life-threatening infections in human fetuses and
immunocompromised individuals. It is a major cause of congenital brain infection and disability in humans. Our laboratory
ﬁrst reported the association of HCMV infection with human
glioblastomas (GBM; ref. 1). These ﬁndings have been conﬁrmed by other groups (2), and clinical trials are currently
underway for the treatment of GBM with anti-HCMV agents
and immunotherapy approaches. A growing body of evidence

suggests that HCMV infection of malignant glioma does not
simply represent an epiphenomenon but rather expression of
HCMV gene products in tumor cells and the tumor microenvironment directly impacts tumor progression. Several HCMV
gene products have been found to have mutagenic and transforming potential (3). We previously showed that the HCMV
IE1 gene product promotes GBM mitogenicity by interfering
with Rb, p53, and AKT signaling pathways (4) and that HCMV
envelope glycoprotein B can directly activate oncogenic signaling pathways through activation of the PDGFR-a receptor
tyrosine kinase (5).
US28 is an HCMV-encoded G-protein–coupled receptor that
is a homologue of the human CCR1 chemokine receptor. US28
is constitutively active and may be further activated by binding
of several ligands: SDF-1, CCL2/MCP-1, CCL5/RANTES, and
CX3CL1/Fraktalkine (6). US28 has properties of a viral oncogene, because ectopic expression of US28 can induce a proangiogenic and transformed phenotype in vivo via activation of
the NF-kB and COX2 signaling pathways (7). A recent report
showed that US28 induces interleukin-6 (IL-6) and VEGF
through NF-kB activation, resulting in potent activation of
the STAT-3 transcriptional activator in NIH 3T3 mouse ﬁbroblasts (8).
We sought to determine whether US28 could (i) inﬂuence
early events that lead to gliomagenesis in neural precursor
cells and (ii) promote key oncogenic features in established

glioblastoma cells. We hypothesized that US28 expression in
neural precursor cells (NPC), possibly the glioma "cell of
origin", may promote the pathogenesis of GBM. We evaluated changes that occur in gene expression patterns and in
the angiogenic and invasion pathways in adult NPCs, when
infected by HCMV or overexpressing US28. Next, we assessed
the changes in the invasive and angiogenic phenotypes of
primary GBM cultures induced by US28 overexpression.
Finally, we conducted loss-of-function studies in human
GBMs persistently infected with HCMV to show the speciﬁcity of US28-induced pathogenesis.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture
U251 and U87 cell lines were obtained from American Type
Culture Collection (ATCC) and grown in DMEM/Ham's F-12 þ
10% FBS. Primary glioblastoma/neural precursor cell–derived
cultures were generated with tissue from surgical resections at
the California Paciﬁc Medical Center obtained according to the
Institutional Review Board–approved protocol. Tissues were
dissociated by enzymatic and mechanical dissociation as
previously described. Single-cell suspensions were cultured
with neural basal medium þ N2 supplement, 20 ng/mL epidermal growth factor (EGF), 20 ng/mL basic ﬁbroblast growth
factor, and 1 mg/mL laminin as previously described (9). For
ELISA for VEGF experiments and tube formation assays, cells
were cultured in the absence of FBS or growth factors at least
48 hours prior to media collection. The NPC cell line was
derived from the hippocampus tissue removed from a patient
with intractable epilepsy. Cells were characterized by immunoﬂuorescence and found positive for Nestin, GFAP, Tuj1, and
Olig2. All experiments were carried out on passages 2 to 5 from
the NPC culture. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells
(HUVEC) were obtained from Invitrogen and grown in the
complete endothelial cell growth media recommended by the
manufacturer.
US28 expression vectors
The Ad-US28 and Ad-Control adenoviruses were a gift from
Dr. Dan Streblow, Oregon Health & Science University. The
pcDEF-US28 plasmid was a gift from Dr. Martine Smit. The
US28 insert was excised from the pcDEF plasmid and cloned
into the pLXSN vector (4). Retroviruses were produced and
used to infect glioma cells as previously described by our
laboratory (4).
Viruses
The Towne and AD169 HCMV strains were obtained from
ATCC and grown in human embryonic ﬁbroblasts, as previously described (10). The TR virus strain was a gift from Dr. Lee
Fortunato, University of Idaho (Moscow, ID).
Knockdown experiments using siRNA to US28
US28 knockdown was achieved with 2 siRNA oligonucleotide
duplexes custom synthesized by Dharmacon. The sense
sequences for the 2 siRNAs are as follows: CGACGGAGUUUGACUACGAUU(1) and CUCACAAAUUACCGUAUU(2). Experi-

ments were carried out with each siRNA individually and the
2 duplexes were combined. As a negative control, nontargeting
control pool from Dharmacon (D-001810-10-05) was used. Effective protein knockdown was veriﬁed at 48 and 72 hours posttransfection and prior to functional assays, as described later.
Fluorescence measurements to quantify US28 expression
levels
Images were taken at ﬁxed exposure times with an Axio
Image Z2 microscope (Zeiss). The ﬂuorescence intensities,
from at least 100 cells, were quantiﬁed with ImageJ software;
plots representing cumulative distribution of mean pixel intensity for various conditions are shown. The Kolmogorov–Smirnov test was used to determine whether the measured differences were statistically signiﬁcant.
Expression proﬁling using the HCMV DNA array and the
Affymetrix Gene ST1 array
Total RNA was isolated and the quality veriﬁed as described
later for reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR). The RNA was
processed for microarray hybridization at the Center for
Applied Genomics, UMDNJ-New Jersey Medical School. The
HCMV arrays were printed and processed as described previously (11). Brieﬂy, the array contains 65-mer oligonucleotides
representing 194 predicted open reading frames (ORF) of the
HCMV strain AD169, 19 oligonucleotides for ORFs in the
Toledo strain that are not found in AD169, and 44 human
genes as controls. Total RNA (3 mg) was reversed transcribed to
cDNA using SuperScript II RT in the presence of cyanine-3
(Cy3) or cyanine-5 (Cy5) dUTP. The labeled cDNA was puriﬁed
and hybridized to the arrays at 58 C for 16 hours. The slides
were scanned with an Axon 4200AL scanner, and the images
were processed with GenePix Pro 6.1. A normalization factor
was calculated using 36 human control genes (11) by dividing
the median intensity of the Cy5 signal by the median intensity
of Cy3 signal of the controls. The data were normalized by
multiplying the Cy3 signal of each spot by the normalization
factor. The ratio of the Cy5 median intensity to the Cy3 median
intensity was determined for each spot and the average ratio
determined for the replicate spots. The accession number for
data from both Affymetrix and HCMV platforms is GSE31142.
HUVEC tube formation assay
Geltrex (Invitrogen #12760-013) was obtained from Invitrogen and thawed overnight at 4 C. One hundred microliters of
Geltrex per well was placed on the bottom of 24-well culture
dishes and allowed to solidify at 37 C for 30 minutes. HUVECs
were detached with EDTA and resuspended in endothelial cell
medium supplemented with various growth factors or conditioned media at 40,000 cells/200mL per well. Tubes were
allowed to form for 8 to 10 hours, and cells were visualized
with a Nikon Inverted Eclipse TE-2000E microscope, ﬁtted with
a CCD Cascade II camera. NIS Elements AR3.0 was used to
acquire images, which were further processed in Photoshop.
Statistical data analysis
Signiﬁcant differences were determined by ANOVA or the
unpaired Student t test, where suitable. Bonferroni–Dunn post

analysis of primary GBM cells that exhibit cytoplasmic and
membrane staining for the US28 antigen. Preincubation of the
primary antibody with excess US28 blocking peptide showed
speciﬁcity of immunostaining (Fig. 1B).
As shown in Fig. 1C, US28 expression was detected in
parafﬁn-embedded GBM biopsy specimens. Figure 1D shows
speciﬁcity of staining, using the US28 blocking peptide in
excess, as described earlier. Sections from the same sample
show abundant staining for VEGF (Fig. 1E) and COX2 (Fig.

inﬂammation in and around the US28-positive tumor cells.
Colocalization of US28 and VEGF in another case of primary
glioblastoma is shown in Supplementary Fig. S1. The speciﬁcity of the US28 antibody was established by comparing
immunostaining of cells that were mock-infected, HCMVinfected, or ectopically expressing US28 (Supplementary Fig.
S2). To conﬁrm that HCMV US28 mRNA was likewise

hoc analyses were conducted when appropriate. The values of
P < 0.05 deﬁned statistical signiﬁcance.

expressed in human GBM specimens, we carried out reverse
transcriptase PCR on RNA extracted from GBM biopsy
specimens from several different patients. Uninfected NPCs
showed no evidence of the ampliﬁed US28 gene product, or
another conserved HCMV gene product UL56 (Fig. 1G). In
contrast, we detected ampliﬁed US28 RNA transcripts in the
primary GBM biopsy specimens from several patients,
including a case found positive by immunohistochemistry
(shown in Fig. 1C–F). All ampliﬁed US28 reverse transcriptase PCR products were sequenced to conﬁrm speciﬁcity to
HCMV, and unique gene polymorphisms were identiﬁed in
several specimens, indicating that no cross-contamination
of laboratory or PCR specimen occurred (C-terminal
sequences alignment is provided in the Supplementary
Information). Additional GBM and control brain tissues
were immunostained for US28, COX2, VEGF, phosphoSTAT3 (p-STAT3), and endothelial nitric oxide (e-NOS; Supplementary Table S1). Of the 35 different brain tissues
screened, 53% were positive for US28 by reverse transcriptase PCR and 65% were positive by immunohistochemistry;
there was more than 90% concordance in the results showing US28 detection when both approaches were used (Supplementary Table S1).
HCMV infection of NPCs induces expression of US28 and
CCL5, which together promote glioma invasiveness
To understand the role HCMV US28 might play in gliomagenesis, we ﬁrst wished to ascertain that US28 is expressed
during HMCV infection of human adult NPCs, the purported
cells of origin of adult GBM. NPCs were infected with HCMV
[Towne and TR strains; multiplicity of infection (MOI) ¼ 1] or
mock infected. Total RNA was harvested at 72 hours, and
HCMV gene expression was assayed with a custom-made
oligonucleotide microarray representing all the predicted
ORFs for HCMV (11). The same samples were proﬁled with
human Affymetrix DNA arrays. As shown in Fig. 2A, US28 was
among the most abundantly expressed HCMV transcripts
following infection with either viral strain. Interestingly, one
of most upregulated human transcripts was the chemokine
CCL5/RANTES (Fig. 2B, arrow). Although US28 can act as a
constitutively active receptor, CCL5 is a bona ﬁde ligand for
US28 and can further stimulate US28 signaling, suggesting that
US28 and CCL5/RANTES coexpression might induce a potent
autocrine signaling loop. To determine whether expression of
CCL5 is a relevant biomarker for GBM, we analyzed the
REMBRANDT GBM database. We determined that CCL5
expression levels were inversely correlated with survival in
human glioblastomas (Fig. 2C). Analysis of previously characterized glioblastoma molecular subclasses (12) showed that
CCL5 expression levels are elevated in the "mesenchymal"
GBMs, characterized by poor patient outcome (ref. 12; Supplementary Fig. S3).
To assess the effects of US28 expression on glioma invasiveness, we carried out Matrigel invasion assays comparing
LXSN with US28-LXSN–transduced U251 and U87 glioma cells
and 2 primary glioma cultures, which had no detectable HCMV
transcripts. US28 overexpression resulted in an approximately
30% increase in the invasiveness of all glioma cell lines tested

6646

Cancer Res; 71(21) November 1, 2011

(Fig. 2D). The presence of 50 ng/mL recombinant human CCL5
in the bottom chamber further enhanced invasiveness of
glioma cells and primary GBM cultures by 50% to 60%, as
shown in Fig. 2D. These data show that CCL5, which is
upregulated by HCMV infection, can augment US28-induced
glioma cell invasion.
To establish the speciﬁcity of US28 effects on glioma cell
invasion, we used a siRNA approach to knockdown US28
expression in a well-characterized human glioma cell line,
U87 (13), persistently infected with HCMV (Supplementary
Fig. S4). US28 protein levels were measured by ﬂuorescence
intensity measurements of cells processed for US28 immunoﬂuorescence. US28 siRNA1 induced an approximately 40%
US28 knockdown, whereas siRNA2 induced approximately
60% US28 knockdown (Supplementary Fig. S5). When used
together, siRNA1þ2 induced approximately 80% US28 knockdown (Supplementary Fig. S5). We used a CCL5-neutralizing
antibody to distinguish between US28 constitutive activity and
the response to the CCL5 ligand secreted by human glioma
cells. Figure 2E shows that CCL5 levels were signiﬁcantly
(75%) inhibited in U87 cells by preincubation with a
CCL5-neutralizing antibody (20 ng/mL, 12 hours), regardless
of the presence of HCMV or US28. Although US28 KD had no
effect in uninfected U87 cells, Matrigel invasion of HCMVpositive U87 cells was inhibited by approximately 20% by US28
siRNA1 or 2 used alone and by 30% when the 2 siRNAs were
used together (Fig. 2F and Supplementary Fig. S5). Pretreatment with CCL5-neutralizing antibody inhibited glioma cell
invasion by approximately 30% to 35% and the use of both US28
knockdown and CCL5 neutralization did not further increase
this effect (Fig. 2F and Supplementary Fig. S5). US28 knockdown a primary GBM culture, conﬁrmed to be HCMV positive,
resulted in inhibition of tumor cell invasion by approximately
35%, both baseline and in response to CCL5 stimulation
(Supplementary Fig. S6).
US28 activates multiple oncogenic pathways
in human NPCs
To determine additional oncogenic pathways activated by
HCMV infection/US28 expression in NPCs, we used a phosphor-kinase human array (R&D Systems) embedded with
antibodies speciﬁc for multiple phosphoproteins (Fig. 3A and
B). Pathways associated with glioma progression and invasion,
including p-STAT3, AKT, ERK1/2, FAK, Src, and eNOS, were
signiﬁcantly activated by both whole virus infection and US28
overexpression in NPCs (Fig. 3C). Immunoﬂuorescence analyses of US28 overexpressing NPCs conﬁrmed upregulation of
COX2, VEGF, p-STAT3, and e-NOS (Fig. 3D). e-NOS levels,
which are elevated in gliomas, correlate with increased tumor
aggressiveness (14, 15). In addition to its proangiogenic role,
e-NOS mediates production of nitric oxide, which was shown
to induce the growth of glioma-initiating cells (16). This is the
ﬁrst report documenting that HCMV US28 induces e-NOS
activation, which contributes to glioma pathogenesis.
Using Western blotting and immunoﬂuorescence, we conﬁrmed that US28 induces p-STAT3 in neural precursor cells
(Supplementary Fig. S7). STAT3 activation is critical for NPC
malignant transformation toward a mesenchymal GBM

p-STAT3 may contribute to gliomagenesis. Consistent with a
recent report, we also found that US28 and p-STAT3 colocalize
in primary glioblastomas in situ (Supplementary Fig. S8),
which would explain why HCMV-positive glioma cells exhibit
activation of the STAT3 pathway, implicated in promoting
immunosuppression, maintenance of glioma stem cells, and
tumor progression (8, 18).

were measured in 4 different cell types (NPC, U251 and U87

sufﬁcient to induce equivalent levels of VEGF expression to
those found after whole HCMV infection, suggesting
that US28 may play a predominant role in the HCMVinduced VEGF secretion. Remarkably, NPCs, which are

US28 in persistently infected glioma lines. US28 knockdown
inhibited VEGF production and glioma cell–mediated angiogenesis as measured by HUVEC tube formation
assays. Figure 5A illustrates US28 and VEGF detection in
persistently infected U87 glioma cells before and after US28
knockdown. We used quantiﬁcation of immunoﬂuorescence
signals to measure the extent of US28 protein knockdown
(Fig. 5B and Supplementary Fig. S5). Cumulative distribution
of pixel intensity for immunopositivity illustrates that
approximately 80% of US28-positive cells lost their signal
after treatment with targeting US28 siRNA1þ2, conﬁrming
effective protein knockdown (Fig. 5B). A similar level of US28
knockdown was achieved in the 4121-HCMV–infected cells
following 72-hour treatment with targeting siRNA1þ2 (data
not shown). VEGF secretion was inhibited by US28 knockdown (Fig. 5B, bottom). Using ELISA, we determined that
VEGF levels (initially induced by HCMV) were inhibited by
35% in HCMV-infected U87 and primary glioma cells, following US28 knockdown using siRNA1þ2 (Fig. 5C). Each

microenvironment (Fig. 6G–L), suggesting that proinﬂammatory and proangiogenic signaling is, at least in part, initiated
and promoted by US28 expression in infected GBM cells.
Together with the other already described mechanisms, such
as activation of the IL-6–p-STAT3 pathway (8), and induction
of CCL5 (our data), HCMV US28 emerges as a key regulator of
GBM progression by enhancing tumor cell invasion and angiogenesis (Fig. 6M).

Discussion
Our laboratory ﬁrst identiﬁed and reported the presence of
various HCMV proteins in human glioblastoma. In this study,
we investigated the role of US28 in driving critical signaling
pathways supporting glioma growth such as invasion and
angiogenesis.
We carried out a systematic screening of human primary
glioma tissues and controls by immunohistochemical and
reverse transcriptase PCR/sequencing, which indicate that
approximately 60% of human GBMs are US28 positive by one
or more techniques. On the basis of these ﬁndings, we hypothesized that US28 expression in normal neural precursor cells
might promote gliomagenesis and that US28 expression in
established GBM cells could promote tumor angiogenesis and
invasion.
The experimental ﬁndings we present here support our
hypothesis. When we infected NPCs with either a laboratory
or clinical HCMV isolate, we detected US28 among the most
highly expressed HCMV genes. Furthermore, HCMV infection
of NPCs resulted in approximately 40-fold increase in CCL5
mRNA levels, which could further enhance US28-mediated
signaling in an autocrine manner because CCL5 binds and
activates US28 (19). CCL5 overexpression has been previously
associated with glioblastoma (20), and we determined that its
expression levels correlate with poor GBM patient outcome by
interrogating a public database.
Our data show for the ﬁrst time the existence of an
autocrine signaling loop in HCMV-infected or US28-expressing glioma cells that respond to CCL5 stimulation with
increased invasive behavior. Interestingly, this interaction
seems to be cell-type speciﬁc, as another study has shown
that macrophages expressing US28 migrate toward Fraktalkine (another US28 ligand) rather than CCL5 (21). In the
context of glioma-associated inﬂammation, US28 may therefore modulate multiple autocrine and paracrine loops, promoting an oncogenic tumor microenvironment. US28 overexpression also induced approximately 3-fold increase in
VEGF levels in both NPCs and GBM cells. Together, these
data indicate that US28 induces a proangiogenic and invasive phenotype both in malignant glioma cells and in NPCs.
To ascertain speciﬁcity of the proinvasive and proangiogenic
activities of US28, we carried out loss-of-function experiments in persistently infected glioma cells and a primary
glioma culture. We used the U87 glioma cell line bearing
well-deﬁned genomic alterations in conjunction with 2
custom-made siRNA duplexes used alone and in combination to asses the speciﬁcity of US28 effects. Our data show
that US28 knockdown signiﬁcantly inhibited GBM cell inva-

sion and secretion of biologically active VEGF in HCMVpositive gliomas. These results also suggest that targeting
US28 may have therapeutic beneﬁts for GBM patients.
Immunohistochemical analysis of biopsy specimens of
patients with glioma showing colocalization of US28 with
VEGF, COX2, p-STAT3, and e-NOS in situ suggests once again
that multiple US28-driven mechanisms contributing to the
aggressiveness of primary GBMs may exist. Our data add to and
corroborate recent reports indicating that HCMV US28 expression can promote oncogenesis. Maussang and colleagues have
shown that US28 expression can induce oncogenic transformation of 3T3 ﬁbroblasts, and this work was recently extended
upon by the demonstration that a critical mediator or the US28
oncogenic signaling pathway is NF-kB, whose activation drives
expression of VEGF and COX2 (22). Our data indicate that
biologically active VEGF is induced by US28 in neural precursors and glioma cells and that COX2 and VEGF are coexpressed with US28 in GBMs.
Slinger and colleagues recently showed that US28 expression
could be detected in human GBM specimens and that it
activates the IL-6–STAT3 signaling pathway in a ﬁbroblast
model system (8). Our data show for the ﬁrst time that US28
induces p-STAT3 activation in NPCs and documents colocalization of US28 and p-STAT3 in primary GBM cultures. A recent
report showed that expression of HCMV US28 in intestinal
epithelial cells led to high penetrance of adenocarcinomas in a
transgenic mouse model of intestinal neoplasia (23). These
tumors could be accelerated by coexpression of an US28 ligand,
CCL2. Consistent with these observations, our results show that
US28 increased glioma cell invasion, which was further
enhanced by the addition of another US28 ligand, CCL5, a
proinﬂammatory cytokine associated with aggressive GBMs.
Taken together, our data suggest that HCMV US28 may be a
critical factor in promoting the transformation of NPCs and the
invasive and angiogenic properties of established glioblastomas. Our results suggest that targeting speciﬁc HCMV proteins
(e.g., US28) in endogenously infected GBMs may disrupt
critical pathways and constitute a novel antitumor approach.
