BACKGROUND: Bevacizumab has recently been demonstrated to prolong overall survival when added to carboplatin
and paclitaxel for chemotherapy-naı̈ve patients with nonsquamous nonsmall-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, the
effects of combining bevacizumab with other standard, front-line, platinum-based doublets have not been extensively
explored. We designed this single treatment arm, phase 2 trial to determine whether the combination of carboplatin,
docetaxel, and bevacizumab is tolerable and prolongs progression-free survival of chemotherapy-naı̈ve patients with
advanced, nonsquamous NSCLC. METHODS: Forty patients were treated with up to 6 cycles of carboplatin (AUC 6),
docetaxel (75 mg/m2), and bevacizumab (15 mg/kg) on Day 1 every 21 days. Patients with an objective response or stable
disease received maintenance bevacizumab (15 mg/kg) every 21 days until disease progression. The primary endpoint
was median progression-free survival. Secondary endpoints included safety, response rates, and overall survival.
RESULTS: The median number of chemotherapy and maintenance bevacizumab cycles/patient was 6 and 2, respectively. Grades 3-5 adverse events included febrile granulocytopenia (10%), infections (13%), bleeding (13%), thrombotic events (13%), hypertension (5%), bowel perforation (5%), and proteinuria (3%). Median progression-free survival
was 7.9 months and median overall survival was 16.5 months. Partial responses were observed in 21 patients (53%),
and stable disease 6 weeks occurred in another 17 patients (43%), for a disease control rate of 95%. CONCLUSIONS:
Carboplatin, docetaxel, and bevacizumab were feasible and effective for front-line treatment of advanced, nonsquamous NSCLC. These data provide further evidence that bevacizumab may be used in combination with multiple

Angiogenesis plays a central role in nonsmall-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) carcinogenesis, through 1 of its key
mediators, the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Merrick et al demonstrated that VEGF expression levels in
bronchial epithelial cells of smokers progressively increase in low to high grade dysplasia.1 In patients with established
lung tumors, there is an association between high circulating levels or intratumoral overexpression of VEGF and poor
prognosis.2-6 VEGF may also facilitate pleural dissemination of lung cancers.7 In preclinical models of NSCLC, VEGF
blockade has been shown to inhibit angiogenesis,8 decrease tumor growth,9 stimulate apoptosis of cancer cells,9 and
enhance antineoplastic chemotherapy effects.10 Taken together, these data support the evaluation of anti-VEGF therapies
in patients with NSCLC.
Bevacizumab is a monoclonal, recombinant, humanized murine antibody targeted at vascular endothelial growth
factor (VEGF). In 2005, the Eastern Oncology Cooperative Group (ECOG) reported the results of the first randomized,
phase 3 trial of carboplatin and paclitaxel  bevacizumab in patients with chemotherapy-naı̈ve, recurrent or metastatic,
nonsquamous NSCLC (E4599). Median progression-free survival and overall survival increased from 4.5 and 10.3
months in the chemotherapy alone treatment arm, respectively, to 6.2 and 12.3 months in the chemotherapy plus

bevacizumab treatment arm (P < .05).11 These results led
to approval of the carboplatin, paclitaxel, and bevacizumab combination in this setting.
Although carboplatin and paclitaxel are commonly
used in the United States for front-line treatment of
patients with NSCLC (and have been considered the
standard backbone chemotherapy regimen in ECOG trials), several large, randomized, phase 3 trials have demonstrated similar efficacy of other chemotherapy agents (ie,
gemcitabine, docetaxel, and vinorelbine) combined with a
platinum salt.12-15 Fossella et al, for example demonstrated that carboplatin and docetaxel elicited a median
overall survival of 9.4 months compared with 9.9 months
for cisplatin and vinorelbine (P ¼ .657) in the randomized phase 3 TAX 326 study, with a superior quality of life
for the docetaxel-treated patients.15 The median progression-free survival was 4.7 and 5.1 months for carboplatin
and docetaxel versus cisplatin and vinorelbine, respectively (P ¼ .235).15 These results established platinumdocetaxel as a valid treatment option for chemotherapynaı̈ve, metastatic NSCLC.
Despite the similar outcomes observed with the use
of front-line combinations of platinum with paclitaxel,
gemcitabine, vinorelbine, or docetaxel, it was unknown
whether addition of bevacizumab to standard-of-care
doublets other than carboplatin and paclitaxel would
result in improved efficacy. Hence, we designed a single
treatment arm, phase 2 trial to determine whether the
combination of carboplatin, docetaxel, and bevacizumab
is tolerable and prolongs progression-free survival of
chemotherapy-naı̈ve patients with advanced, nonsquamous NSCLC, compared with historical controls.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

and imaging studies for assessment of evaluable lesions. If
all eligibility criteria were met, patients initiated treatment
with carboplatin (area under the curve [AUC] of 6) intravenously (IV) on Day 1, docetaxel (75 mg/m2) IV on Day
1, and bevacizumab (15 mg/kg) IV on Day 1. Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) support use was
not mandatory but was allowed for primary prophylaxis
of febrile neutropenia at the discretion of the treating
physician. Cycles were repeated every 21 days until disease progression, death, or intolerable toxicity. Blood
count, electrolytes, and liver function tests were
obtained before each cycle. Proteinuria (urine proteincreatinine ratio or dipstick urinalysis) was monitored every 2 cycles. Imaging studies for assessment of treatment
response were also obtained every 2 cycles. Chemotherapy (ie, carboplatin and docetaxel) delays, dose reductions, and discontinuation were implemented according
to standard criteria prespecified in the protocol. Bevacizumab dose reductions were not allowed. Bevacizumab
administration was delayed if patients experienced grade
3 nonpulmonary and noncentral nervous system hemorrhage (until resolution of the bleeding), grade 3 congestive heart failure (until resolution to grade 1), grade 3
proteinuria (until resolution to grade 2), and grade
2 bowel obstruction (until resolution of the obstruction). Bevacizumab was permanently discontinued in
the following cases: grade 3 hypertension not controlled
by medication or grade 4 hypertension; grade 2 pulmonary or central nervous system hemorrhage or grade
4 hemorrhage at any site; symptomatic grade 4 venous
thromboembolism; arterial thromboembolic event (any
grade); grade 4 congestive heart failure; grade 4 proteinuria, gastrointestinal perforation (any grade); and
wound dehiscence (any grade). Patients who required a
treatment delay 2 months (regardless of the reason)
were not permitted to restart bevacizumab. Six cycles of
chemotherapy plus bevacizumab were planned. Patients
who demonstrated stable disease (SD), partial response
(PR), or complete response (CR) to treatment continued on single-agent bevacizumab 15 mg/kg every
21 days until disease progression or intolerable toxicity.
Patients who discontinued chemotherapy before 6 cycles
of treatment were also allowed to continue on singleagent bevacizumab in the absence of progressive disease
(PD).
Study Endpoints and Statistical Analysis
The primary endpoint of the study was progression-free
survival, defined as the time from treatment initiation to

disease progression or death. We estimated the historical
median progression-free survival as approximately 4.5
months in patients treated with docetaxel and carboplatin,
based on the randomized phase 3 TAX 326 study.15 An
increase in median progression-free survival to 6.3 months
with the addition of bevacizumab would be considered
significant. Assuming a 1-sided type I error rate of 10%
and exponential progression-free survival, a study with 50
patients would have at least 81% power to detect the
aforementioned treatment effect. No interim analyses
were planned.
Secondary endpoints of the study included the
assessment of overall survival, disease control rate (CR þ
PR þ SD, defined by RECIST16), and evaluation of the
safety profile of this triple-agent regimen.
All patients who received at least 1 dose of the study
drug were analyzed for efficacy and toxicity endpoints.
Continuous variables are presented using median (range).
Categorical variables are summarized in frequency tables.
Time-to-event endpoints were computed using the
method of Kaplan and Meier.

RESULTS
Patient Characteristics
Between December 2005 and February 2009, 40 patients
were enrolled in the study. Their baseline characteristics
are described in Table 1. The trial was interrupted before
the planned 50 patients were enrolled because of slow
accrual after bevacizumab became commercially available
in the United States for NSCLC treatment.
Treatment Characteristics
A total of 363 cycles of treatment were delivered to all
enrolled patients and dose reductions were uncommon
(15% of the patients for docetaxel and/or carboplatin). The median number of chemotherapy þ bevacizumab cycles was 6 and the median number of
maintenance bevacizumab cycles was 2 (Table 2). GCSF support was used in 11 patients (28%) as primary
prophylaxis. The majority of patients (50%) discontinued the study drugs because of disease progression;
however, 12 patients (30%) required treatment discontinuation because of toxicities (5 patients with
thrombotic events, 2 patients with bowel perforation, 2
patients with hemoptysis, and 1 patient each with
hypertension, allergic reaction, and infection). Five
patients are still on treatment (Table 2).

Toxicity
Hematologic toxicities were common with grades 3-4
anemia, thrombocytopenia, and granulocytopenia occurring in 10%, 15%, and 33% of the patients, respectively.
Four patients (10%) had febrile granulocytopenia (Table
3). The most common grades 3-5 nonhematologic toxicities were infection (13%), hemorrhagic events (13%: 2
patients with hemoptysis, 2 patients with epistaxis, and 1
patient with pleural bleeding), and thrombotic events
(13%: 2 patients with deep vein thrombosis, 2 patients
with pulmonary embolism, and 1 patient with an ischemic cerebrovascular accident). Other grades 3-5 bevacizumab-related adverse events were seen at lower frequencies,
such as hypertension (5%), bowel perforation (5%), and
proteinuria (3%) (Table 3). Two patients had possible
treatment-related deaths: 1 patient died suddenly on Day
10, cycle 1 (no autopsy), and 1 patient died from an infection in a necrotic lung mass after 12 cycles of treatment
(at which point in time the patient also had disease
progression).

second patient had had prior episodes of blood mixed
with sputum before study entry, not meeting the protocol’s exclusion criterion of bright red blood of 1 to 2 teaspoons or more. The hemoptysis, however, was
exacerbated after 6 doses of bevacizumab. Both patients
were adequately treated with radiation therapy and discontinuation of bevacizumab.
Efficacy
Thirty-eight patients have completed more than 2 cycles
of treatment and are evaluable for response (2 patients discontinued treatment prematurely after 1 cycle of treatment because of sudden death and an episode of deep
venous thrombosis). A PR was observed in 21 patients
(53%, 95% confidence interval [CI], 37%-68%), of
which 20 were confirmed. SD 6 weeks occurred in
another 17 patients (43%), for an overall disease control
rate (CR þ PR þ SD) of 95% (95% CI, 88%-100%)
(Table 4). Median duration of response was 7.2 months
and median duration of stable disease was 6.0 months.
To date, 27 patients (68%) have had documented
disease progression and 23 patients (58%) have died. Five
patients (13%) are still on active treatment. The median
progression-free survival was 7.9 months (95% CI, 6.0-

11.1) (Fig. 1), indicating a statistically significant
improvement over the historical control (evidenced by the
lower boundary of the confidence interval above the historical median progression-free survival mark of 4.5
months). Median overall survival was 16.5 months (95%
CI, 13.6-31.2) (Fig. 1).

DISCUSSION
In this study, we demonstrated that treatment with the
combination of carboplatin, docetaxel, and bevacizumab
in chemotherapy-naı̈ve patients with advanced nonsquamous NSCLC was associated with a median progressionfree survival of 7.9 months and median overall survival of
16.5 months, which compares favorably to historical controls. Bevacizumab-related toxicities were observed and
included bleeding, thrombosis, hypertension, bowel perforation, and proteinuria, as well as an increased risk of
granulocytopenic fever.

Since the initiation of this study, in addition to
E4599, the results of other trials exploring the incorporation of bevacizumab to first-line platinum-based doublets
have been presented, including the randomized phase 3
AVAiL trial (cisplatin and gemcitabine  bevacizumab),17 as well as the single treatment arm phase 2 studies
of bevacizumab combined with carboplatin þ pemetrexed,18 oxaliplatin þ pemetrexed,19 and carboplatin þ
nanoparticle albumin-bound paclitaxel.20 Hence, in addition to E4599 and TAX 326, these trials provide additional toxicity and efficacy data with which our results
may be compared and contrasted.

Bleeding (including hemoptysis) has been associated
with bevacizumab treatment for NSCLC, even in patients
with nonsquamous histology. In E4599, grade 3 bleeding occurred in 22 of 427 bevacizumab-treated patients
(5.2%), with hemoptysis occurring in 8 patients
(1.9%).11 In AVAiL, grade 3 bleeding occurred in 28 of
the 659 bevacizumab-treated patients (4.2%), with
hemoptysis in 8 patients (1.2%).17 The incidence of
bleeding in our study was 13% (including hemoptysis in
5% of the patients), which may seem somewhat higher
than the previously reported experiences. However, the
small number of patients could have overestimated the
incidence of adverse events and precludes definitive conclusions on an increased bleeding risk with the carboplatin-docetaxel combination. Bleeding did not appear to be
secondary to low platelet counts, because only 1 episode
(epistaxis) occurred during grade 3 thrombocytopenia.
The rate of venous thromboembolic events (10%), arterial
thrombotic events (3%), hypertension (5%), bowel perforation (5%), and proteinuria (3%) were similar as previously observed in bevacizumab-treated groups in the
E459911 and/or AVAiL17 trials.
Bevacizumab has also been shown to modestly
increase the risk of chemotherapy-induced (febrile) granulocytopenia. In our study, 4 patients (10%) had febrile
granulocytopenia, compared with 5.2% and 2% of bevacizumab-treated patients in the E4599 and AVAiL trials,
respectively.11,17 The febrile granulocytopenia incidence
in the TAX-326 study was 3.7% in the docetaxel-carboplatin treatment arm.15 Despite the higher incidence of
febrile granulocytopenia, no fatal events were observed in
this trial, possibly attributed to the frequent use of
optional prophylactic G-CSF support (28%). This is in
contrast with 5 and 1 granulocytopenic fever-related
deaths in E4599 and AVAiL.11,17 Five patients (13%) in
our study developed grade 3 infections with the rates
comparable to the incidence of infection associated with
carboplatin and docetaxel alone in TAX 326 (11%).15
The toxicity profile outlined above highlights the
importance of adequate patient selection for bevacizumab
treatment. In our study, we observed 2 possible treatment-related deaths (in E4599, 15 of 417 bevacizumabtreated patients had treatment-related deaths).11 The
impact of bevacizumab on the incidence of adverse events
is further illustrated by a 30% rate of toxicity-related treatment discontinuation (in AVAiL, 26%-30% of bevacizumab-treated patients discontinued treatment because of
adverse events, compared with 23% of patients in the placebo treatment arm).17 Nonetheless, despite treatment-

2406

related complications, outcome measures overall were still
favorable in our study.
The present trial met its primary endpoint of
improving median progression-free survival compared
with the carboplatin-docetaxel treatment arm in the TAX
326 study (from 4.7 to 7.9 months).15 Moreover, the median progression-free survival in our study compares
favorably to E4599 (6.2 months)11 and AVAiL (6.5
months for the bevacizumab 7.5 mg/kg arm, and 6.7
months for the bevacizumab 15 mg/kg arm).17 The median overall survival (16.5 months) was also higher than
carboplatin and docetaxel alone (9.4 months in TAX
326),15 and 1 of the highest observed among other platinum-based regimens plus bevacizumab: 12.3 months (for
the carboplatin, paclitaxel, and bevacizumab treatment
arm in E4599),11 13.4-13.6 (for the cisplatin, gemcitabine, and bevacizumab treatment arms in AVAiL),17 14.1
months (for carboplatin, pemetrexed and bevacizumab,
phase 2),18 15.8 months (for carboplatin, nanoparticle albumin-bound paclitaxel, and bevacizumab, phase 2),20
and 16.7 months (for oxaliplatin, pemetrexed, and bevacizumab, phase 2).19
The greatest limitation of our study is that it is a single institution, single treatment arm, phase 2 trial with
only 40 patients. As such, comparison of efficacy endpoints achieved with other regimens may be highly biased
by patient selection. However, the promising progressionfree survival and overall survival observed in our cohort of
patients (especially when compared with E4599 and
AVAiL) may lead us to speculate whether there is a preferred platinum-based regimen to which bevacizumab
should be combined.
Docetaxel has been shown to inhibit endothelial cell
proliferation, migration, and capillary formation, thus
serving as an antiangiogenic agent by itself. VEGF confers
resistance of endothelial cells to docetaxel, which is overcome by the addition of an anti-VEGF recombinant
humanized monoclonal antibody to docetaxel, both in
vitro and in vivo.21 Paclitaxel has also been demonstrated
to have antiangiogenic properties (reviewed elsewhere).22
The antiangiogenic activities of docetaxel and paclitaxel
have been compared in preclinical models: Hotchkiss et al
demonstrated that human umbilical endothelial cells
(HUVECs) were more sensitive to docetaxel than paclitaxel in chemokinetic or chemotactic migration assays in
vitro23; Vacca et al demonstrated an enhanced inhibitory
effect of docetaxel compared with paclitaxel in the angiogenic phenotype of HUVECs in vitro (proliferation, chemotaxis, vessel morphogenesis) and in vessel formation in

the chick embryo chorioallantoic membrane angiogenesis
model in vivo24; and Grant et al demonstrated that compared with paclitaxel, docetaxel is approximately 10 times
more potent in inhibiting endothelial cell proliferation
and differentiation into tubes and in promoting endothelial cell death in vitro.25 Taken together, these results suggest that docetaxel might be a more effective
antiangiogenic agent than paclitaxel. When combined
with bevacizumab in the clinical setting, regimens containing docetaxel might achieve highest antivascular
effects and lead to enhanced response rates, progressionfree survival and overall survival than paclitaxel-based regimens, thus possibly explaining the favorable results
observed in this study when compared with E4599.
Future exploratory analysis of 2 large-scale studies may
further support this observation: ARIES is an observational treatment cohort study of first-line bevacizumab use
for NSCLC in the community. A preliminary report demonstrated that of the first 621 patients, 61% received carboplatin plus paclitaxel, and 12% received carboplatin
and docetaxel.26 ATLAS is a randomized study of maintenance erlotinib and bevacizumab versus bevacizumab
alone after first-line chemotherapy with bevacizumab.27
Subgroup analysis comparing the efficacy of the different
chemotherapies used in these studies might provide further evidence on what could be the preferential backbone
cytotoxic regimen to be used with bevacizumab. Although
strengthened by a large sample size, these analyses would
still be exploratory and would have to be tested in a
randomized setting, if appropriate.
In conclusion, this is the first reported study to use
the carboplatin, docetaxel, and bevacizumab combination. Our study demonstrated that the regimen is feasible
and effective as a first-line treatment for advanced, nonsquamous NSCLC cancer. Our data provide further evidence that bevacizumab may be used in combination with
multiple standard platinum-based doublets in this setting.
