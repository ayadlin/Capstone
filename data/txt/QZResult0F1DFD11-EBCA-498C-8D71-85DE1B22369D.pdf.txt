ABSTRACT
Targeted cancer therapy aims to disrupt aberrant cellular signalling pathways.
Biomarkers are surrogates of pathway state, but there is limited success in
translating candidate biomarkers to clinical practice due to the intrinsic complexity
of pathway networks. Systems biology approaches afford better understanding
of complex, dynamical interactions in signalling pathways targeted by anticancer
drugs. However, adoption of dynamical modelling by clinicians and biologists is
impeded by model inaccessibility. Drawing on computer games technology, we
present a novel visualization toolkit, SiViT, that converts systems biology models of
cancer cell signalling into interactive simulations that can be used without specialist
computational expertise. SiViT allows clinicians and biologists to directly introduce
for example loss of function mutations and specific inhibitors. SiViT animates the
effects of these introductions on pathway dynamics, suggesting further experiments
and assessing candidate biomarker effectiveness. In a systems biology model of Her2
signalling we experimentally validated predictions using SiViT, revealing the dynamics
of biomarkers of drug resistance and highlighting the role of pathway crosstalk. No
model is ever complete: the iteration of real data and simulation facilitates continued
evolution of more accurate, useful models. SiViT will make accessible libraries of
models to support preclinical research, combinatorial strategy design and biomarker
discovery.

INTRODUCTION

single-target-single-drug paradigm [4] in the face of three
major complexities: (1) the intrinsic complexity of pathway
networks, (2) unforeseen feedback effects, and (3) dynamical
adaptive changes in pathways when challenged by a drug.
Each of these complexities attracts different
challenges. Topological complexity is an essential
regulatory characteristic of cellular signaling pathways,
with signaling networks exhibiting such features as
pathway cross-inhibition, cross-activation, redundancy
and convergence [5]. Targeted therapies can impact these
regulatory processes resulting in system-scale changes to
behavior reaching beyond the targeted region in ways that
are difficult to predict [6]. Feedback in signaling networks

Targeted cancer therapy aims to disrupt aberrant
cellular signaling pathways. Drug targets are identified
within those pathways that should be functionally linked to
disease progression and have a disease specific biomarker to
predict or assess therapeutic response [1]. Such biomarkers
are thus surrogates of pathway state, but there has been
limited success in translating candidate biomarkers to
clinical practice [2]. Indeed only a tiny fraction of identified
potential biomarkers have been adopted into clinical practice
[3]. A key limitation to clinical translation of biomarkers
is rooted in a drug design process typically framed in a

likewise has a regulatory role, exerting either positive or
negative effects on cascade components [7]. Feedback loops
provide plasticity in signaling pathway behavior that can
enable cells to adapt to therapeutic insult [8]. Further, there
is a growing body of research to suggest that the strengths
of these regulatory mechanisms are not static: they are
dynamic over time in response to drug action [9] and so it
is likely that dynamic features of network signaling might
form the basis of drug targets rather than the network
components themselves [10]. These complexities and
dynamical adaptive changes may confer resistance to
drug therapy [11] and increasing evidence from clinical
studies that combination therapies offer a possible route to
address drug resistance [12, 13] and cell line studies point
towards the use of combination therapy to sensitize cells to
anti-cancer therapy [14].
In the face of this complexity, our representations
of signaling pathways and drug combinations have
become increasingly sophisticated, and there is a growing
opportunity for systems biology modeling to contribute to
experimental design and to unravel the mechanisms and
complexities of network functioning and combination
therapy design [15]. For example, in a recent theoretical
study of mono- and combination therapy to overcome drug
resistance to kinase inhibitors [16] based on thermodynamic
factors, the developed model is able to demonstrate both
resistance to single drug treatment for two inhibitors
when applied individually to the same kinase target and
the overcoming of that resistance when those inhibitors
are applied in combination. Further, through systematic
investigation into model dynamics a suggested mechanism
of action is identified, whereby the binding of one promoter
to an inhibitor introduces conformational change in another
promoter and this change provides a target for a second
inhibitor to act in combination.
The value of this and other systems biology models
depends on sophisticated model analysis and interpretation
of model complexities, including for example the
determination of system-scale control parameters such
as the transition from drug resistance to sensitivity [17]
and state space search optimization methods for model
parameter estimation [18]. Analytical methods such as these
are typically the working arena of theoreticians. Importantly,
biologists and clinicians with the pertinent domain expertise
are then dependent on such theoreticians to explore
model dynamics, and this is a relative barrier to effective
implementation of systems biology models into preclinical
and clinical stages of drug development.
To overcome this barrier, we present a new,
interactive, visualization and animation technology, SiViT
(Signaling Visualization Tool), to enable biologists and
clinicians to work directly with the model. SiViT allows
biologists and clinicians to directly introduce and visualize
the effects of changes in pathway dynamics in silico (for
example by introducing mutations or inhibitors) thereby
identifying unforeseen interactions, suggesting further
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

experiments where the model is incomplete and identifying
and assessing the possible effectiveness of candidate
biomarkers as read outs of pathway status after dynamical
adaptation. SiViT is generalizable and accessible, thus
supporting preclinical research, combinatorial strategy
design and biomarker discovery.
SiViT provides a single framework within which
models may be imported (in Systems Biology Markup
Language (SBML) format [19]) and their dynamics
animated. Model structure is automatically projected onto a
graph, with graph nodes representing entities in the network,
such as molecular species and drugs, and edges representing
node interconnections–the pathways. SiViT allows
interactive animation of both species concentrations and
signaling activity over time. These core features enable life
scientists to animate and probe the dynamics of a cellular
signaling model. Most importantly, SiViT allows domain
experts to interact with the model, be it by introducing
species mutations and/ or by adding specified (combinations
of) concentrations of drugs at specific times.
Beyond these features, SiViT facilitates comparison
of model dynamics in two different experimental regimes,
for example with and without drug intervention and/ or
under species mutation, through an easy to use menu
system. Comparisons between experimental regimes are
depicted using intuitive, color-coded animations. The result
is an interactive in silico exploration and discovery platform
to enable the life scientist to explore and exploit existing
SBML-format models of cellular signaling and drug action.
We illustrate these model features using as an exemplar the
cell signaling model and experimental regimes described in
detail in [20] and [21]. SiViT and supporting documentation
is available from the authors on request together with the
exemplar signaling model. SiViT requires a full installation
of MATLAB 2011b (www.mathworks.com) but will
automatically install all other required software.

RESULTS
Visualizing signaling networks with SiViT
The visualization created by SiViT is encapsulated in
a User Interface (Figure 1). SiViT automatically arranges
the model as a network where nodes are species and edges
are reactions, arranged according to a force-directed graph
algorithm [22] that optimizes layout. A play icon allows
visualization of model dynamics and is linked to a slider bar
that allows the user to manipulate the visualization forwards
and backwards in time.
The main window (Figure 1) depicts the signaling
network in response to a particular in silico experimental
regime (drug interventions, mutational status). The color
scheme depends on the configuration of SiViT. For a single
experiment SiViT shows the network in white. Each species
is shown as a node and species concentration is depicted
by the radius of a translucent sphere around that node
29658

Oncotarget

(see Figure 1, Inset 2). Importantly this radius will increase
and/ or decrease over the course of the simulation according
to the calculated concentrations from within the signaling
model. Reaction velocities among nodes are visualized in
a similar manner: edge thickness is a function of reaction
velocities and so increases and/ or decreases in line with
model dynamics.
Where two different experimental regimes are set
up for comparison, the visualization is tri-colored (white,
red, blue). Regimes are defined via the intervention
panel, and one regime is designated “Control”; the other
“Experiment”. For every time point the values of each node
and each edge in the Control and Experiment are compared.
If there is no difference between these values the node/
edge is white; if the Experiment value is higher or lower
than the Control value the node/ edge is colored red or blue
respectively, with intensity proportional to this difference.
The intervention panel (Figure 1, Inset 1) is a pop-up dialog
box that allows the introduction of known drugs and/ or
mutations. Drugs may be selected from a drop-down list
and both the dosage and timing of application of that drug
specified. For protein expression and catalytic activity
changes indicative of mutations, any species in the model
may be selected from a drop-down list and the protein

concentration level or kinetic constant and the time of
change in that concentration level or kinetic constant may
be specified. In this way, complex regimes with multiple
drugs and multiple mutations may be specified.
Additionally, and to illustrate the visualization of
other models with SiViT, we loaded the SBML model of
ERK signaling from [23]. In an exploration of the link
between cell fate and signaling dynamics model results
show that an increasing in one ERK isoform results in
a decrease in the other isoform. To demonstrate model
functioning we reproduced some key findings (see
Supplementary Figure S1).

Interactive animation of signaling responses to
combination therapies
Using the model of the PI3K/PTEN/AKT and RAF/
MEK/ERK signaling pathways developed in [20], [21] and
[17], we use SiViT to reveal the dynamic signaling response
to: (1) application of a growth inhibitor drug; (2) introduction
of a mutation in the network that is known to confer drug
resistance; (3) addition of a second drug to restore network
sensitivity, i.e. a combination therapy to overcome drug
resistance.

The computational model describes the signaling
response kinetics to heregulin, a growth factor that binds
with receptors in the Erbb family to induce HER3/HER2
receptor dimerization pHER23 (see model schematic in
Figure 2). This in turn stimulates tyrosine phosphorylation
that in turn drives intra-cellular signaling activity. This
signaling activity can be inhibited by receptor tyrosine
kinase (RTK) inhibitors, and we include one such inhibitor
in our model: pertuzumab (2C4 antibody). Pertuzumab
is designed to target HER2 to inhibit HER2 dimerization
with other Erbb family members, and especially formation

of the oncogenic HER2-HER3 dimer. This HER2-HER3
dimer can activate the PI3K/PTEN/AKT signaling pathway
that governs cell survival and so proliferation and tumor
growth. Pertuzumab thus acts to suppress activation of the
PI3K/PTEN/AKT cell survival pathway. Supplementary
Videos S2 to S4 and still Figure 3A–3D show the dynamical
response of this model visualized through SiViT, and show
the PI3K/PTEN/AKT pathway vertically downwards.
Supplementary Video S2 shows the addition of 30 nM
pertuzumab at the beginning of the simulation, and animates
the network dynamics in response to drug action compared

to network functioning without drug application. The drug
is added through a drop-down menu of available therapies,
with a standard dosage provided that can be edited, and the
drug is added at the current time point in the simulation by
default (also editable to allow for sequential application).
The first minute of simulation dynamics shows the early
network response to the addition of the drug (top left):
regions depicted with higher activity are the node in the
network representing the drug concentration and the HER2
node to which it binds. Additionally, increases in HER3
and HER3 bound with heregulin are observed (in red) since
HER2 inhibition limits HER2/HER3 dimerization and so
more HER3 is free.
SiViT highlights the impact of pertuzumab on
network signaling following drug action, and shows this
impact propagating along both PI3K/PTEN/AKT and RAF/
MEK/ERK pathways over time in Supplementary Video S1.
Figure 3A depicts the response of the signaling network to
30 nM pertuzumab after 1 minute compared with normal
functioning in the absence of pertuzumab. This reduction in
signaling activity was constant throughout the simulation:
Figure 3A shows the simulation after 10 minutes. The key
output from this pathway, AKT, is shown in the graph insert
in Figure 3A: SiViT analysis revealed an increase in AKT,
and so a decrease in active, phosphorylated AKT over the
10 minute simulation. Note the single node to the far left of
this pathway is the input node for a second drug.
Within this pathway, the PTEN-pPTEN cycle
response was time variant as shown in the Supplementary
Video S2: PTEN concentration level decreased over time
in normal functioning since activated PTEN, i.e. pPTEN,
increased. Following inhibition by pertuzumab those
species that would normally bind with PTEN were inhibited
(blue) and so PTEN levels reduced at a much slower rate.
Figure 3A shows no (notable) change in PTEN level after
1 minute; Figure 3B reveals the relative increase in PTEN
level following inhibition and the graph insert in Figure 3B
shows PTEN level over the whole simulation.
A similar time variant is observed in the RAF/MEK/
ERK signaling pathway. Figure 3A–3D shows the RAF/
MEK/ERK pathway across the top of the signaling network.
As a consequence of the reduction in input signal pHER23
following HER2 inhibition by Pertuzumab we observed a
reduction in signaling activity in the whole pathway at 1
minute (Figure 3A). At 10 minutes (Figure 3B) we observed
increases in signaling activity. Importantly, and in contrast
to PI3K/PTEN/AKT signaling, this represents a time lag in
signaling activity. The reduced input pHER23 slowed down
the rate but not the level of signaling in this pathway: at the
10-minute time point measured levels are then higher but
this is an artefact of differential phasing. These dynamics
can be observed in Supplementary Video S2.
Next we introduced a mutation, PTEN loss, into
the network associated with resistance to anti-cancer drug
therapy. PTEN loss was represented in the model by a 50%

www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

reduction in original PTEN level. Again we focused on AKT
signaling and the impact of PTEN loss on the effectiveness
of pertuzumab in inhibiting AKT signaling. Note that both
our model and experimental systems confirmed that PTEN
loss alone does not influence AKT activity. Supplementary
Video S3 shows the introduction of that mutation through
the Adjust Model section of the dialog box, and the resulting
network dynamics in response to pertuzumab compared
with a network response without this mutation. SiViT
reveals an increase in AKT signaling, shown in the edges
connected to the AKT node and these are visible from one
and a half minutes onwards. Supplementary Video S3 also
shows progressive decreases in the region surrounding
PTEN (lowest part of the network in Figure 3C) manifest
in the various PTEN complexes (see schematic in Figure 2),
with some nodes that would otherwise interact with PTEN
showing an increase due to lower levels of complex
formations. Figure 3C shows the effect of PTEN loss on the
efficacy of Pertuzumab compared with Pertuzumab action
in a network with no mutation. Figure 3C depicts a marked
decrease in the amount of AKT (see graph insert) over the
10-minute period, reflecting the increase in AKT signaling.
Finally, the decrease in MEK, pMEK and ppMEK is due to
cross-talk between the PI3K/PTEN/AKT and RAF/MEK/
ERK signaling pathways, e.g. lower levels of activating,
phosphorylated RAF.
We then restored network sensitivity to pertuzumab
following PTEN loss with the addition of a second drug,
the PI3K inhibitor LY294002. The combination therapy
of pertuzumab and LY294002 was identified via an
in silico perturbation analysis and subsequently confirmed
via in vitro experiments [17], to derive a control parameter
that governs the signaling response of the PI3K/PTEN/
AKT pathway to pertuzumab. This control parameter
encapsulates the ratio of PTEN to the product of active
PI3K and AKT, and so PTEN loss can be compensated for
by PI3K inhibition (or AKT inhibition). Supplementary
Video S4 and Figure 3D show the response of the mutated
network to this combination therapy compared to the normal
network response to pertuzumab. Note that in [17] we
reported on 5000 nM of LY294002; here we used SiViT to
explore the parameter space to identify a very close match to
AKT signaling in normal response to pertuzumab (see Inset
graph) with only 100 nM of LY294002. The down-regulated
region in Figure 3D at 10 minutes of simulation time occurs
because of the reduction in concentrations of PTEN (through
mutation) and PI3K (through drug action). Supplementary
Video S4 reveals the dynamics of this down-regulation,
and shows differential, increased down-regulation of the
PI3K/PTEN/AKT pathway after 1 minute compared to the
original sensitive network (Supplementary Video S2). This
difference is short-term and after approximately 7 minutes
there is no substantial difference between the original
sensitive network and this network where sensitivity has
been restored through combination therapy.

Dynamics of biomarkers of drug resistance

Supplementary Video S5 and Figure 4B show the
response of the signaling network to heregulin and 30nM
of Pertuzumab after 60 minutes compared with normal
functioning. The effect of pertuzumab is similar to the PE04
network of Figure 3A: SiViT analysis revealed an increase
in AKT, and so a decrease in active, phosphorylated AKT
over the simulation. Following inhibition by pertuzumab
those species that would normally bind with PTEN were
likewise inhibited (blue). Of note is the effect of pertuzumab
on signaling downstream of AKT (far right of Figure 4B).
Downstream AKT complexes were down-regulated; in
contrast, SiViT revealed upregulation in the MEK signaling
cascade that binds with PP2A. PP2A provides cross-talk
between AKT and MEK pathways, and it is this cross-talk
that drives upregulation of MEK-PP2A complexes. Downregulation of AKT causes an increase in availability of
PP2A, the levels of which remain largely constant following
pertuzumab, resulting in increased MEK-PP2A complexes.
The effect of this cross-talk becomes increasingly

In [24] we used a slightly modified version of
the model presented in Figure 2 and developed a global
sensitivity analysis (GSA) approach to support exploration of
the effect of adjusting multiple model parameters on signaling
pathway activity, with a particular focus on phosphorylated
AKT. Biomarkers of AKT signaling dysregulation were
determined based on those parameters that had the highest
levels of sensitivity for pAKT signaling levels. Figure 4A–4D
show the integration of GSA and SiViT analyses for the
identification and interpretation of biomarkers PDK1 and
PI3K. Figure 4A shows experimental results and model
predictions for phosphorylated AKT signaling dynamics in
OVCAR4 cell line in response to heregulin stimulation and
drugs targeting either HER2 growth receptor or the identified
biomarkers PDK1 and PI3K. Figure 4B–4D shows SiViT
visualizations of the OVCAR4 cell line for each experimental
condition in Figure 4A.

pronounced over the time course of the simulation as shown
in Supplementary Video S5. The Inset in Figure 4B shows
integrated pAKT signaling in response to heregulin the
presence (blue line) and absence (black line) of Pertuzumab
and these show good agreement with the blue (HRG+2C4)
and red (HRG) lines in Figure 4A respectively.
Figure 4C and 4D show the network response
to heregulin and either PDK1 inhibition with UCN-01
(Figure 4C) or PI3K inhibition with LY294002 (Figure 4D)
compared to the network response to heregulin. Figure 4A
shows PDK1 inhibition is less effective at reducing AKT
signaling than Pertuzumab. In addition to this single
measure, Figure 4C shows the effect of PDK1 inhibition on
the entire network after 60 minutes, and reveals markedly
less inhibition upstream of AKT compared with inhibition
by Pertuzumab. Down-regulation and upregulation of
the AKT and MEK signaling cascades respectively are
comparable with signaling activity following pertuzumab
and this is driven by the same PP2A cross-talk. Figure 4D
shows the effect of PI3K inhibition on the whole network.
Network response to PI3K inhibition is broadly similar
to Pertuzumab inhibition across the network, although

the down-regulation of the PI3K/AKT pathway is more
pronounced following PI3K inhibition. Insets in Figures 4C
and 4D show time course dynamics of the integrated pAKT
signaling in response to heregulin the presence (blue line)
and absence (black line) of PDK1 and PI3K inhibition
respectively, and these show good agreement with the purple
(HRG+UCN-01) and green (LY294002) lines in Figure 4A.

DISCUSSION
We have developed an interactive animation tool
that can import any suitably formatted dynamical model
written in SBML. SiViT is compatible with a wide range
of curated models stored on the open access EMBL-EBI
BioModels database (https://www.ebi.ac.uk). We provide
scripting that converts those models to a form executable
by the SimBiology toolbox. Models may be uploaded to
the BioModels database for curation and then used with
SiViT. Additionally, our software is open source and so
other researchers are able to provide bespoke conversion
scripts, in either Java or MATLAB, guided by our scripts
or otherwise.

SiViT allows a non-computational specialist user to
interrogate the possible effects of a drug, a combination of
drugs and the response of a biomarker to adaptive change
in the tumor cell. Biomarker elucidation in the context of
combination therapies attracts the challenge of searching
through a large state space of possible drug targets, pathway
status readouts, drug dosages and timings of application
in a problem domain characterized by non-linearities,
topological complexity and dynamic rewiring. Systems
biology models can capture some of that complexity as
exemplified in our consideration of signaling responses to
combination therapies. Computational search frameworks
can explore that state space in a focused, directed manner
as exemplified in our elicitation of biomarker dynamics.
SiViT affords observation of those complexities in a given
network and allows easy exploration of model dynamics
and sensitivities that can inform the search criteria crucial to
success of any computational search framework. SiViT can
make a direct contribution to complement existing efforts
in this arena of study.
For example, [25] describe a model for predicting
the impact of combination therapies on the RAS/PI3K
signaling network for a panel of cell lines with different
mutational status. They show how model analysis can
support the identification of combination treatments and
subsequently confirm the predictions from the model
in a xenograft system. A central issue raised is that only
particular combination treatments work for particular cells
and modeling can guide this challenging discovery process.
Complementary to such model analysis, our approach allows
biologists and clinicians to design in silico combination
treatments by adding drugs to different cell lines with
specified doses and mutations through a menu interface and
observing the impact on the signaling network.
Moreover, given a growing awareness that it is not
simply the mix of drugs that constitute a combination
therapy but also the scheduling of their application, SiViT
can support sequential application studies. For example,
[9] undertook a sophisticated combined experimental
and theoretical study of the sequential application of anticancer drugs. They noted that complexities in signaling
networks such as feedback and cross-talk make predicting
cellular responses to drug action difficult and especially
so in cancer cells since functioning is aberrant. This
difficulty is compounded for combination therapies. [9]
targeted triple negative breast cancers and showed that
EGFR inhibition prior to DNA damaging chemotherapy
(doxorubicin) sensitizes some cell lines to that damaging
agent. Analysis of gene expression profiles of cell lines
that were both sensitive and insensitive to time-staggered
EGFR inhibition followed by doxorubicin revealed marked
differences in genes including those linked to key survival
and inflammation pathways. Further proteomic analyses
revealed differences in pathways, including those linked
to survival, in cells sensitive to sequential combination
therapy. This response is explained in terms of a rewiring of
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

the signaling pathways to sensitize cells to doxorubicin as a
result of pre-treatment with EGFR inhibitor; co-treatment or
post-treatment did not sensitize cells.
The notion of pre-treating cells to promote
sensitivity to a second treatment seems intuitive, yet
other work highlights further complexities in sequential
combination therapy [26]. In this study a time-dependent
effect of PI3K/mTOR inhibition on doxorubicin-induced
apoptosis in neuroblastoma cells was observed. Posttreatment with the PI3K/mTOR inhibitor most sensitized
the cells to doxorubicin treatment; the sensitizing effect
was less pronounced in co-treatment and pre-treatment.
This observation reveals that the order of application of
combination therapy depends on context. SiViT provides
a platform that supports such contextual investigation.
Drugs can be added in any order, with each added at
an individually specified time and dose. Comparison
between different regimes, which could vary in timing and
or dose, allows in silico optimization of time-staggered
combination therapies.
Clearly, the identification of biomarkers and the design
of effective combination therapies are challenging and
require systematic experimental study informed by systems
biology modeling. We propose that SiViT provides a valuable
bridge between the fields of cell biology and computational
modeling, enabling cell biologists and clinicians to explore
available models of signaling pathways and drug actions in
an environment that does not require expert computational
modeling expertise, simply an awareness of the process of
modeling. Through our generalizable technology we seek
to promote the uptake of modeling by the biological and
clinical communities in support of preclinical research,
combinatorial strategy design and biomarker discovery.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
SiViT framework
SiViT comprises three major components: a controller
interlinking interfaces to both the user and to MATLAB for
model (re)calculation, and is implemented as a suite of Java
program files. Figure 5 depicts the overall structure of SiViT.
SiViT requires as external files the cellular signalling model
itself as implemented in MATLAB with the model structure
represented within a SBML scheme, a list of therapeutic
interventions (drug name and typical concentration) and an
optional set of 3D graphical object files (not shown).
Central to this architecture is the SiViT controller,
which has two major roles: to import both a specific
signaling model and a predetermined list of model
interventions; and to translate both user interactions with the
visualized model into updated parameter sets for MATLAB,
and model results into the visualized model. Optionally the
SiViT controller can import 3D graphical objects illustrating
each node (species) to enhance visual aesthetics (not shown
in Figure 5; see User Interface below).

Importing the model requires the reading in of the
SBML scheme that defines the model. Implemented using
the matlabcontrol (code.google.com/p/matlabcontrol/)
Java API to MATLAB, the SiViT controller establishes
a communication protocol to MATLAB in terms of
parameters and forms a software link in order to invoke
the MATLAB model, managed by the MATLAB interface.
The list of pre-defined therapeutic interventions is a file of
[drug name, dosage] pairs; note dosage (in nM) and time
of application can be modified through the User interface.
Note interventions not on this list can be introduced easily.
The algorithm describing SiViT operation is provided in
Supplementary Text S6.

species and reactions together with protein concentrations
and reaction velocities over time. Through the
matlabcontrol API the selected signaling model is executed
and the time series of results (concentrations, velocities)
updated. Any interventions added to the model through
the User interface are captured as user-generated events
and added to the parameter set for the signaling model.
When the SiViT controller detects a parameter set change
the MATLAB interface triggers recalculation of the model.
The computed model may then be queried through this
MATLAB interface for all species and reaction names, and
all protein concentrations and velocities over time. This
combination of intervention addition, model recalculation
and state variable query provide all the data to feed the
User interface.

Interlinking the MATLAB model and the User
interface is more complex. The User interface drives the
dynamics of this interlink. In summary, the loading of a new
model and changes to a model through the User interface
(see below) generate interface events that are passed to
the SiViT controller and converted into changes to the
parameter set for the MATLAB interface. The MATLAB
model is then (re)calculated and results passed back to the
SiViT controller via a data structure. This data structure
is then processed and passed to the User Interface for an
updated visualization. Note the User interface is able to
specify and then compare two different model regimes, and
in this case the SiViT controller manages two concurrent
data structures: one for each set of model results.
In more detail, the MATLAB interface is provided
with a data structure capturing the form of the parameter
set of the signaling model in terms of names of both

The User interface is shown in Figure 1 and
comprises a menu bar (upper top), time slider bar (lower
top), central viewing frame (main area) and intervention
panel (right). The menu bar allows the loading of a model
into SiViT, and saving of the visualized model image (.jpg)
at any point in the simulation. The interactive environment
allows zooming in/out and rotational control of the model to
support exploration and this combined with image saving,
provides a means to record model dynamics.
The loaded model is arranged on screen
procedurally, automatically accounting for the size and
topological features of the signaling network. The view
itself may be specified as 2D or 3D (allowing rotation
around axes). Within this high-level constraint the
spacing of the nodes is implemented as a force-directed

Figure 5: SiViT architecture. Interoperation of major components (rounded rectangles), external resources (rectangles) and key

interactions (arrows). Through the User Interface, users may select an SBML file containing the SBML scheme for the model, and load
that model into SiViT with an accompanying set of therapeutic interventions (a file of [drug name, dosage] pairs). SiViT then constructs a
model as defined by the SBML, passed as parameters to MATLAB, and captures all time series data computed by MATLAB, i.e. the results,
pertaining to all biomolecular species. The visualization is based on both the model structure, i.e. species and reactions as prescribed in
the SBML, and the results of model execution, i.e. species concentrations and reaction velocities over time. A user may make changes to
that model via the interface, e.g. by adding a drug at a prescribe time, and this generates an event that is translated into a change in model
parameters. This in turn results in a model recalculation, the results of which are passed back for re-visualization.

graph layout algorithm [22]. This algorithm seeks to
optimize the network structure such that edges are of
equal length and that edges do not intersect (in 2D or 3D
space as specified). In our implementation, and to provide
additional flexibility in layout choices, it is also possible
to constrain the layout algorithm such that the network is
arranged onto the surface of a sphere.
The time slider bar allows the user to move forwards
and backwards in time through simulation dynamics
simply by moving the slider between 0 and maxTime,
the maximum duration of the simulation. By pressing the
play icon to the left of the slider bar, the slider icon on this
bar will move from left to right automatically during the
simulation. The play function can also be paused, and the
slider moved by the user (forwards and backwards in time).
Finally, a small dialogue box to the right of the slider bar
allows modification of the speed of model animation.
The central viewing frame holds the signaling
network itself, and the detail of the visualization is
dependent on whether SiViT is being used to explore the
dynamics of a single experimental regime or compare two
different regimes. For a single experimental regime the
visualization is monochrome (white). Nodes in the network
depict species concentration: the radius of the sphere is
proportional to the species concentration and so varies in
line with model dynamics. If the optional 3D graphical
objects are imported the center of the node is a bespoke
volume image for that species; if not it is a yellow volume
image. Reactions are shown as inter-node connections, i.e.
graph edge, and edge thickness is proportional to reaction
velocities and so varies in accordance with model dynamics
over the course of the simulation.
