BACKGROUND: The management of brain metastases in patients with germ cell tumors remains controversial. The authors assessed
the outcome in this patient group after the introduction of GAMEC chemotherapy (14-day cisplatin, high-dose methotrexate, etoposide, and actinomycin-D with filgrastim support) and cessation of the routine use of cranial irradiation. METHODS: Data were
recorded prospectively from 39 patients with germ cell tumors and concurrent brain metastases who received treatment before and
after the advent of GAMEC after they relapsed on conventional cisplatin-based chemotherapy. Neurosurgery was offered to selected
patients. Radiotherapy generally was used only as a salvage therapy after chemotherapy failure. The primary outcome measure was
overall survival and was depicted using a Kaplan-Meier plot. RESULTS: The 3-year overall survival rates were 38% for the whole
cohort, 69% for those who presented with brain metastases at diagnosis (group 1), and 21% and 0% for those who developed metastases after initial chemotherapy (group 2) and while receiving chemotherapy (group 3), respectively. For the whole cohort, the median overall survival was 10.6 months (range, 5.5 months to not evaluable); and, for groups 1, 2, and 3 individually, the overall survival
was not yet reached (range, from 7.4 months to not evaluable), 6.2 months (range, 2.1-15.3 months), and 2.7 months (range, from 0.6
months to not evaluable), respectively. The 3-year survival rate for those who received GAMEC chemotherapy was 56% compared
with 27% for those who received chemotherapy pre-GAMEC. CONCLUSIONS: The prognosis for patients with germ cell tumors and
brain metastases seems less bleak than previously thought. It is possible to achieve long-term survival with chemotherapy alone.

INTRODUCTION
Germ cell tumors are among the most common cancers in young men.1 The prognosis for patients with advanced germ
cell tumors can be estimated according to the risk criteria set out by the International Germ Cell Consensus Classification.1 Patients with good-prognosis disease have a 5-year survival rate >90%, but this falls to approximately 50% for those
in the poor-risk group. Patients with nonpulmonary visceral metastases, which include brain metastases, fall into the
poor-prognosis group, but the 5-year survival rates for patients with brain metastases appears to be worse than the rates for
others within this group: 33% compared with 35% for those with bone metastases and 49% for those with liver metastases.1 Brain metastases occur in approximately 10% of patients who have advanced, metastatic germ cell tumors. They are
present in approximately 3% of patients at diagnosis, but autopsy studies indicate that this rises to 40% in patients who
die from the disease.2
In their retrospective review, Bokemeyer et al separated patients into 3 groups.3 Those who presented with brain metastases had the best prognosis (43%; group 1), those who developed metastases after the completion of chemotherapy had
a poorer prognosis (group 2), and those who developed metastases during chemotherapy had the worst prognosis (<5%;
group 3). A larger series reported similar overall survival (OS) rates in these groups but also identified an association
between improved outcomes and the receipt of cisplatin-based and ifosfamide-based treatments (2-year survival rate,
67%) or intravenous cisplatin, vincristine, and methotrexate (1 g=m2) with additional intrathecal methotrexate alternating
with actinomycin-D, cyclophosphamide, and etoposide at presentation (POMB=ACE).4
Several other small series reported an association between improved survival and the presence of solitary rather than
multiple brain metastases. All patients who did not achieve complete remission with chemotherapy went on to undergo
surgery and receive cranial irradiation.5,6 Most retrospective studies have used cranial radiotherapy in combination with

systemic chemotherapy to achieve the best outcome, but
no randomized controlled studies have defined the
optimal treatment for patients with brain metastases, and
treatment strategies vary.4,7,8 There have been suggestions
that chemotherapy alone might be as effective in
achieving complete remission and long-term survival in
patients with brain metastases, especially for those who
present with brain metastases at diagnosis. The
numbers are small, but the chemotherapy regimen
POMB=ACE, when supplemented with intrathecal methotrexate, led to 8 long-term survivors in a group of
10 patients.9 High-dose chemotherapy seems to provide
higher OS rates.
With concerns about the risk of late treatmentrelated toxicities associated with cranial irradiation, such
as cognitive decline in young long-term survivors, the routine use of cranial radiotherapy in patients with germ cell
tumors and brain metastases should be questioned,
although it remains part of the National Comprehensive
Cancer Network practice guidelines. The relatively small
number of patients with germ cell tumors and brain metastases creates difficulties for the design of prospective
studies, and retrospective studies remain important in
developing and optimizing treatment strategies for these
patients.
In this single-institution study, we report outcome
data for patients with advanced germ cell tumors and brain
metastases who received treatment between 1993 and
2012. Initially, treatment was with standard platinumbased chemotherapy (cisplatin or carboplatin with etoposide and bleomycin); however, later, 2 different regimens
were developed: GAMEC (14-day treatment with cisplatin,
high-dose methotrexate [8 g=m2], actinomycin-D, and etoposide with growth factor support10) and IPO (irinotecan,
paclitaxel, and oxaliplatin) consolidated with high-dose
chemotherapy for those who progressed after GAMEC.11
The introduction of these regimens coincided with a cessation in the routine use of cranial irradiation in patients who
presented with brain metastases or those who were treated
at first relapse with GAMEC. Therefore, we wished to
determine the outcome in this particular patient group
when routine cranial irradiation was stopped and a highdose methotrexate regimen, without the use of intrathecal
methotrexate, was introduced.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients

Between 1993 and 2012, 39 consecutive patients with
germ cell tumors and brain metastases who were treated at
1640

Barts Cancer Center, St. Bartholomew’s Hospital London, were identified from patient records. Seventeen
patients (44%) fell into group 1 (those who presented
with brain metastases), 16 patients (41%) fell into
group 2 (those who developed metastases after the completion of chemotherapy), and 6 patients (15%) fell into
group 3 (those who developed metastases during chemotherapy). The median patient age was 29 years (range,
20-53 years). Further patient characteristics are provided
in Table 1.
Thirty-seven patients were treated with primary
chemotherapy. Before the year 2000, patients received
standard cisplatin-containing chemotherapy regimens;
but, after the year 2000, patients received GAMEC either
as primary therapy (patients in group 1 or those patients
with International Germ Cell Consensus Classification
poor-prognosis disease) or as salvage therapy after relapse,
regardless of the presence or absence of brain metastases.
In terms of which group patients fell into, the demographics were comparable between those who received
treatment in the pre-GAMEC era and those who received
treatment in the GAMEC era. In total, 21 patients
received GAMEC, either at presentation (n 5 15) or after
relapse (n 5 6). Neurosurgery was offered to selected
patients, mainly those with solitary brain metastases
(n 5 9). Radiotherapy was reserved for patients who failed
salvage chemotherapy. Survival was calculated according
to the Kaplan-Meier method, and survival curves were
compared using the log-rank test.
Chemotherapy Regimens

The GAMEC regimen consisted of cisplatin 100 mg=m2
in weeks 1, 3, 6, and 8 plus 50 mg=m2 in weeks 2 and 4;
actinomycin D 1 mg=m2 in weeks 1, 3, 6, and 8; highdose methotrexate 8 g=m2 (with dose adjustments for renal impairment) in weeks 1, 3, 6, and 8; and etoposide
360 mg=m2 in weeks 1, 3, 6, and 8. The IPO regimen
consisted of oxaliplatin 100mg/m2 day 1, irinotecan
200mg/m2 day 1, paclitaxel 80mg/m2 day 1,8 and 15 every 21 days. The IPO regimen consisted irinotecan 200
mg=m2 on day 1; paclitaxel 80 mg=m2 on days 1, 8, and
15; and irinotecan 200 mg=m2 on day 1 repeated every 3
weeks for a maximum of 4 cycles with high-dose consolidation using carboplatin at an area under the receiver
operating characteristic curve of 21, topotecan 30
mg=m2, and thiotepa 500 mg=m2.
IPO followed by high-dose chemotherapy was used
as a salvage regimen if the primary therapy was GAMEC.
If there was evidence of progression on IPO but the
patient was deemed fit enough to proceed to high-dose

RESULTS
Outcome data are provided in Table 2. The 3-year median OS rate for the whole cohort was 38%, and it was
69% for group 1, 22% for group 2, and 0% for group 3
(Fig. 1). The median OS for the whole cohort and for

from 5.5 months to not evaluable [NE]), not yet reached
(range, from 7.4 months to NE), 6.2 months (range, 2.115.3 months), and 2.7 months (range, from 0.6 months

fatal cerebral herniation within 6 hours of starting chemotherapy despite the use of steroids in the 2 days preceding
chemotherapy. Three-year survival rates were 44% for the
27 patients who were treated after 2000 compared with
25% for those patients who were treated before the year
2000. The management of individual patients is detailed
in Figures 2-4.
Data surrounding the specific number of brain metastases were available for 38 of the 39 patients. Twenty
patients had a solitary brain metastasis and 18 patients had
2 metastases, and the long-term OS rates for these groups
were 51.5% and 25%, respectively (Fig. 3). In total, 9
patients underwent neurosurgery, including 6 patients who

had a solitary metastasis. Only 1 patient in group 1 underwent neurosurgery, and he achieved a cure. In group 2, 6 of
15 patients underwent neurosurgery, and 3 of those
patients were progression-free at 3 years; whereas 9 patients
did not undergo surgery, and all died within 16 months. In
group 3, 2 patients underwent neurosurgery, including 1
who had a single metastasis, and both patients died.
Regarding the pattern of failure 14 patients progressed overall. In 7 patients, progression was in the central nervous system (CNS) only—all of these patients had
more than 1 cerebral metastasis. In 1 patient who had a
single cerebral metastasis, progression occurred with the
development of meningeal deposits and multiple cranial
nerve palsies. In 5 patients, disease progression was
both in the brain and outside the CNS; 3 of these patients
only had a single cerebral metastasis. One patient with

Radiotherapy was offered to 11 patients, including 2
patients in group 1, 6 patients in group 2, and 3 patients
in group 3. It was never offered as an initial therapy and
only appears to have made a possible contribution to outcome in 2 patients. In both of those patients, there was no
evidence of progression in the brain before radiotherapy.
Eleven patients received high-dose chemotherapy,
including 5 patients in group 1 (see Fig. 2), and all have
remained alive. One patient received high-dose chemotherapy after failure on GAMEC, 3 received it after failure
on conventional-dose chemotherapy, and all have
remained progression-free. In 1 patient, high-dose chemotherapy failed; and combined bleomycin, etoposide, and

High-dose chemotherapy seemed particularly useful
on first relapse, specifically for patients who had failed on
GAMEC. The combination of GAMEC followed by IPO
and high-dose chemotherapy seemed to produce the
greatest overall responses. It is noteworthy that only 1
patient from group 1 achieved a cure using conventional
chemotherapy alone.
DISCUSSION
Germ cell tumors are uniquely chemosensitive and often
curable, even with advanced, metastatic disease.12 However, in other chemosensitive tumors, such as small cell
lung cancer, CNS recurrence occurs because of issues with

poor chemotherapeutic penetration through the bloodbrain barrier and can terminate a complete remission.12 It
is unclear whether the CNS represents a sanctuary site in
germ cell tumors, and the relevance of the blood-brain
barrier in the treatment of patients with brain metastases
remains controversial. Furthermore, there is no clear consensus regarding the optimal therapeutic strategy for these
patients, although several groups have recommended
treating solitary CNS metastases with either stereotactic
radiosurgery or surgical resection followed by cisplatinbased chemotherapy and treating multiple CNS metastases with whole-brain radiation therapy and concomitant
cisplatin-based chemotherapy.3,13 Others generally advocate treating with chemotherapy alone and then reevaluating with CNS imaging. If complete remission is
achieved, then additional treatment often is not advised,
and close follow-up is recommended. However, in the
context of small, residual CNS disease or a solitary lesion,
subsequent surgical excision or stereotactic radiosurgery
often is used. Whole-brain radiotherapy often is reserved
for highly symptomatic patients with large CNS metastases or for those with persistent or recurrent metastases. It
is noteworthy that, in patients who presented with brain
metastases at the time of germ cell tumor diagnosis, Fossa
1644

et al demonstrated that systemic chemotherapy had the
greatest impact on survival and that cerebral radiotherapy
did not significantly influence outcome. However, cerebral radiotherapy and neurosurgery appeared to represent
essential treatment modalities for patients in whom brain
metastases were diagnosed after induction chemotherapy.4 Nonetheless, the description of a group of patients
with newly diagnosed CNS germ cell tumors being successfully treated with chemotherapy alone provides evidence against there being a functional blood-brain barrier
in this disease.14 Furthermore, it appears that, in half of
patients, progression in the CNS is associated with concurrent progression outside the CNS, suggesting that systemic therapy should represent the mainstay of treatment
in this patient subgroup. In the remaining 50% of patients
who had progression within the CNS, many had more
than 1 metastasis; and the question of whether selective
radiation to these lesions may offer some benefit is clearly
relevant to these patients, particularly for areas of the
brain in which surgery is likely to lead to neurologic
deficit.
Our study included all patients with germ cell
tumors and concurrent brain metastases who were treated
at our center between 1993 and 2012. During that period,
Cancer

treatment for poor-prognosis disease, as well as salvage
therapy for relapse, was changed to GAMEC, an intensified, cisplatin-based regimen that incorporates high-dose
methotrexate. The doses used are far higher than those
used in the POMB=ACE schedule; and, because methotrexate can cross the blood-brain barrier, this regimen
may negate the use of intrathecal chemotherapy. We have
demonstrated that the introduction of high-dose methotrexate and the cessation of cranial irradiation across
patient groups do not appear to be associated with poorer
survival. It is interesting that the patients who progressed
after receiving GAMEC did not progress in the brain
alone, providing some evidence that, in these patients, the
blood-brain barrier may not be the cause of treatment failure and that cranial irradiation may not have affected
outcome. However, we also have demonstrated that highdose salvage chemotherapy in patients who relapsed with
brain metastases was clearly effective in some cases, and
this may relate to the finding that the drugs used in such
regimens can penetrate the blood-brain barrier at the
doses used, but not at the lower doses administered in previous lines of therapy. Furthermore, high-dose chemotherapy was able to rescue patients who had failed on
high-dose methotrexate in several cases. Whether the
combinations used were particularly important is unclear,
but the relative success post-GAMEC using 2 drugs with
known brain penetration (topotecan and thiotepa) is
encouraging.11
A weakness in the current prognostic scores is that,
for patients with brain metastases in whom relapse is
determined by rising tumor markers, physicians can never
be sure about the origin of such rises in markers. Furthermore, if there are persistent brain lesions, then it is not
always clear whether those lesions are active or necrotic.
Consequently, patients receiving whole-brain radiotherapy in this situation may be receiving it needlessly. The
role of radiotherapy given with curative intent remains
controversial, and there are increasing concerns about
long-term side effects, such as progressive, multifocal leukoencephalopathy with ataxia; concentration difficulties;
and sensory motor changes.12 The value of stereotactic
radiotherapy remains undefined; and, although it is likely
to lead to fewer long-term side effects, it may not treat
micrometastatic disease within the CNS, which is an important consideration if a blood-brain barrier is believed
to be present.
The 2 current prognostic systems based on the time
to development of brain metastases3 and the number of
metastases (single vs multiple) both were validated in this
series. Our data demonstrate a long-term survival rate of
Cancer

June 1, 2014

69% in patients who presented with brain metastasis
(group 1) and received first-line chemotherapy with
GAMEC, which is above those rates previously reported.
For our patients in group 2, the long-term survival rate
was 21%, which was similar to the rate reported by
others for patients who had brain metastases at initial
diagnosis.
At the time of this writing, 16 patients within this
study were free from disease progression, and 11 had
achieved this with chemotherapy alone. This suggests that
GAMEC can achieve long-term survival on its own, without the need for additional treatment modalities. The relative failure of initial conventional chemotherapy to
produce long-term survival in patients with brain metastases is disappointing. Many of these patients who were
treated before the year 2000 will have received doses of
etoposide and bleomycin that would be considered suboptimal today, and this may have accounted in part for the
poor initial outcome.
Cisplatin-based chemotherapy remains the standard of care for patients with brain metastases. However,
there are suggestions that high-dose chemotherapy or
high-dose methotrexate-based chemotherapy may be
superior regimes for these patients and that this strategy
may be responsible for the improved outcome described
for such patients in this study group. Large, systemic
analyses and prospective trials investigating the optimal
management of patients with germ cell tumors and brain
metastases are still lacking. The rarity of this clinical situation means that conducting large clinical trials in this
area is especially difficult, but such studies are required
so that treatment for these patients can be sufficiently
optimized.
