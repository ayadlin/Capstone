KDM4/JMJD2 Histone Demethylases: Epigenetic Regulators
in Cancer Cells
William L. Berry and Ralf Janknecht

Abstract
Lysine methylation is one of the most prominent histone posttranslational modiﬁcations that regulate
chromatin structure. Changes in histone lysine methylation status have been observed during cancer
formation, which is thought to be a consequence of the dysregulation of histone lysine methyltransferases or
the opposing demethylases. KDM4/JMJD2 proteins are demethylases that target histone H3 on lysines 9 and
36 and histone H1.4 on lysine 26. This protein family consists of three 130-kDa proteins (KDM4A-C)
and KDM4D/JMJD2D, which is half the size, lacks the double PHD and Tudor domains that are epigenome
readers and present in the other KDM4 proteins, and has a different substrate speciﬁcity. Various studies
have shown that KDM4A/JMJD2A, KDM4B/JMJD2B, and/or KDM4C/JMJD2C are overexpressed in breast,
colorectal, lung, prostate, and other tumors and are required for efﬁcient cancer cell growth. In part, this
may be due to their ability to modulate transcription factors such as the androgen and estrogen receptor.
Thus, KDM4 proteins present themselves as novel potential drug targets. Accordingly, multiple attempts are
under way to develop KDM4 inhibitors, which could complement the existing arsenal of epigenetic drugs
that are currently limited to DNA methyltransferases and histone deacetylases. Cancer Res; 73(10); 2936–42.

Introduction
Negatively charged DNA wraps around a core of positively
charged histones to allow for condensation of our genetic
material. The state of compaction changes following speciﬁc
alterations in histone posttranslational modiﬁcations. Acetylation and methylation are the two predominant covalent
modiﬁcations, where acetylation of a positively charged lysine
residue reduces the overall charge of a histone and generally
leads to the relaxation of chromatin and thereby enhanced
gene transcription. Methylation on arginine or lysine residues,
in contrast, does not alter the charge of histones and can have
repressive or activating consequences on gene expression,
depending on which particular arginine or lysine residue
becomes modiﬁed (1, 2).
Global as well as local changes in chromatin structure are
characteristic for tumors, suggesting that such epigenetic
changes are an underlying cause of cancer. Accordingly,

enzymes involved in histone modiﬁcation and also DNA
methylation may be viable drug targets. And indeed, histone
deacetylase and DNA methyltransferase inhibitors are already
approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the
treatment of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma and myelodysplastic
syndrome, respectively. However, targeting enzymes that
methylate or demethylate histones has not yet progressed to
standard clinical use (3).

JMJD Proteins
Not long ago, histone methylation was considered to be an
irreversible mark. This dogma was ﬁnally laid to rest upon the
discovery of the ﬁrst lysine-speciﬁc demethylase (LSD1) in 2004
(4). Human LSD1 and its only paralog, LSD2, demethylate
mono- and dimethylated histone H3 lysine 4 (H3K4) and
H3K9 through a FAD-dependent amine oxidation reaction.
The second known family of histone demethylases, the JMJD
(Jumonji C domain-containing) proteins, is composed of 30
members in humans based on the presence of the roughly 150
amino acid–long JmjC (Jumonji C) domain (5). However,
whereas most of the JMJD proteins have been proved to
demethylate H3K4, H3K9, H3K27, H3K36, or H4K20, the catalytic activity of several JMJD proteins remains to be uncovered. Notably, some JMJD proteins are predicted to have no
catalytic activity at all. Furthermore, it remains controversial
whether any JMJD protein can target methylated arginine
residues (6).
JMJD proteins use a different reaction mechanism compared
with LSD1/2. They act through a dioxygenase reaction mechanism requiring Fe2þ, O2, and 2-oxoglutarate to demethylate
histones. The true catalytic step is the hydroxylation of a lysine

regular start site (Fig. 1B). Moreover, the role of H3K36
methylation (and likely H3K9 and H1.4K26 methylation) is
not limited to transcription control but extends to alternative splicing, DNA replication, recombination, and repair (8).
Accordingly, modiﬁcation of the histone methylation status
due to changes in KDM4 activity may have profound effects
on the transcriptome and other nuclear processes and
therefore also on the initiation and progression of cancer.
Here, we focus on the potential oncogenic roles of the KDM4
proteins.

The Protagonist: KDM4A/JMJD2A
The most studied member of the KDM4 family is KDM4A/
JMJD2A, also sometimes called JHDM3A (JmjC domaincontaining histone demethylase 3A). Although KDM4A is
capable of demethylating H3K9 and H3K36, qualitative
and kinetic measurements indicate that it demethylates
H3K9me3 about 5-fold more efﬁciently than H3K36me3. In
addition, KDM4A is more efﬁcient in demethylating triversus dimethylated H3K9/H3K36 (9–12) and, even more
speciﬁcally, only demethylates trimethylated H1.4K26 (13).
An explanation for its substrate speciﬁcity was provided by
X-ray crystallographic structure analyses of KDM4A with
and without peptide substrates. These studies revealed that
amino acids surrounding lysines 9 and 36 on histone H3
primarily determine the binding speciﬁcity of KDM4A,

methyl group, thereby converting it to a hydroxymethyl moiety
that spontaneously disconnects from the nitrogen center
resulting in the release of formaldehyde. This reaction mechanism allows JMJD proteins in principle to demethylate tri-, di-,
and monomethylated lysine residues, whereas LSD1 and
LSD2 are prohibited from attacking trimethylated lysines
due to the requirement of a free electron pair on the methylated nitrogen (5, 6). One of the largest JMJD subfamilies that
has recently attracted much attention is composed of the
JMJD2A-D proteins (nowadays preferentially called KDM4AD, for K demethylase 4 A-D), which are capable of recognizing
di- and trimethylated H3K9 and H3K36 as well as trimethylated
H1.4K26 as substrates (Fig. 1A and 1B).
In general, H3K9 and H1.4K26 trimethylation are associated with transcription repression or heterochromatin formation, whereas H3K36 methylation has been perceived
with activating gene expression (1, 3). However, this situation may be more nuanced, as cross-talking with other
histone modiﬁcations inﬂuences the outcome of H3K9,
H3K36, and H1.4K26 methylation (7). Also, H3K36 methylation shifts from mono- to trimethylation from the promoter
to the end of transcribed genes. Thus, H3K36 trimethylation
perhaps inhibits gene transcription at the start site but
facilitates transcription elongation and prevents unwanted
transcription initiation within the body of the gene that can
negatively interfere with transcription initiation from the

whereas the space and the electrostatic environment in the
methyl group–binding pocket allow tri-/di- but not monomethylated lysine residues to position a methyl group productively toward the iron-containing catalytic center
(11, 14–16).
A major study focus on KDM4A has been in transcription
regulation, where it may either stimulate or repress gene
transcription. The latter function may involve association
with the nuclear receptor corepressor complex or histone
deacetylases (17, 18) or direct binding to a transcription
factor as observed for the p53 tumor suppressor (19), but it
remains unresolved whether this repressing function
requires KDM4A enzymatic activity. In contrast, KDM4A
formed complexes with both the androgen and estrogen
receptor (ER) and stimulated their activity, which was
dependent on KDM4A catalytic activity (20, 21). Accordingly,
depletion of KDM4A in ER-positive T47D breast cancer cells
decreased the expression of ER targets such as the c-Jun and
cyclin D1 oncogenes and led to reduced cell growth. Equally,
JMJD2A knockdown inhibited proliferation of ER-negative
MDA-MB-231 and ER-positive MCF7 breast tumor cells (22,
23), suggesting that KDM4A is critical for growth of both
ER-positive and -negative breast tumors. Consistent with an
oncogenic function of KDM4A, it is overexpressed at the
protein level in about 60% of breast tumors (21) and further
reports show KDM4A overexpression also at the mRNA level
in this cancer (24, 25). Likewise, KDM4A is overexpressed in
prostate (26) and lung cancer (ref. 27; see also Supplementary Table S1).
Similar to breast cancer cells, downregulation of KDM4A
in multiple colon cancer cell lines resulted in reduced cell
proliferation and furthermore increased apoptosis and
delayed the G2–M phase of the cell cycle (19). In U2OS
human osteosarcoma cells, KDM4A depletion resulted in
G0–G1 growth arrest, whereas senescence was induced in
normal ﬁbroblasts. On the other hand, overexpression of
KDM4A cooperated with the H-Ras oncoprotein in transforming human IMR90 ﬁbroblasts by suppressing Rasinduced senescence (27). However, no growth effect was
observed upon KDM4A overexpression or downregulation in
HeLa cervical carcinoma or 293T embryonal kidney cells,
although S-phase progression was accelerated by wild-type,
but not catalytically inactive KDM4A; seemingly, the S-phase
acceleration was neutralized by delays in other cell-cycle
phases (28). Together, these ﬁndings imply that KDM4A
overexpression will not generally stimulate tumor growth
but will only do so in certain organs or cell types. It remains
to be determined which circumstances allow KDM4A to
exert a pro-oncogenic function, for instance, the tissuespeciﬁc expression of cooperation partners.
Interestingly, overexpression of KDM4A, but not its H188A
catalytic mutant, in mouse NIH3T3 cells reduced recruitment of heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1) to pericentric
chromatin (10). Moreover, KDM4A overexpression reduced
binding of HP1g to chromatin during replication in 293T
cells concomitant with a more open chromatin structure. On
the other hand, depletion of HP1g led to increased chromatin accessibility early in S phase, suggesting that KDM4A and

2938

Cancer Res; 73(10) May 15, 2013

HP1g antagonize each other during DNA replication, which
may represent a possible mechanism for how KDM4A promotes DNA replication. This antagonism appears to be
conserved in the worm Caenorhabditis elegans, as loss of
its sole KDM4 homolog led to slower DNA replication and
this defect could be rescued by depletion of the C. elegans
HP1 homolog (28).
In the fruitﬂy Drosophila, HP1a associates with KDM4A and
stimulates its H3K36 demethlyation activity. Unlike mammalian KDM4A, the Drosophila homolog appears to be incapable
of demethylating H3K9, although this is controversial (29, 30).
Moreover, Drosophila KDM4A overexpression resulted in
HP1a spreading from the chromocenter into the chromosome
arms, and HP1a was shown to recruit KDM4A to a subset of
heterochromatic genes where it could demethylate H3K36me3
(29–31). Currently, it is unresolved whether and how the
interaction between HP1a and KDM4A affects DNA replication
in Drosophila. However, it appears that these 2 proteins antagonize each other in the modulation of Drosophila gene transcription (32).
KDM4A is endowed with a double plant homeodomain
(PHD) as well as a double Tudor domain (Fig. 1A). The latter
binds to di- and trimethylated H3K4 and H4K20 (33–35),
whereas the function of the KDM4A PHD domains has
remained unknown. H3K4 trimethylation is a hallmark of
active promoters and is normally mutually exclusive with
H3K9 trimethylation, which is a mark of inactive chromatin
(3). Thus, KDM4A may be recruited via the Tudor domains to
active gene promoters and guarantees that H3K9 and also
H1.4K26 become demethylated, which will amplify gene transcription by, for example, counteracting the binding of HP1 to
these epigenetic marks. Although not yet studied for KDM4A,
KDM4B is also part of the mixed-lineage leukemia 2 complex
that has H3K4 methyltransferase activity, pointing at a potentially Tudor domain–independent way that KDM4B and possibly KDM4A concurrently demethylate H3K9 whereas H3K4
becomes trimethylated (36).
An unexpected function of KDM4A (and apparently also
KDM4B) independent of its enzymatic activity was revealed
in the DNA damage pathway. Here, 53BP1 is recruited into
DNA damage foci and required to orchestrate the DNA
damage response. Both 53BP1 and the Tudor domains of
KDM4A competed for binding to dimethylated H4K20.
However, KDM4A became ubiquitylated by the E3 ligases
RNF8/RNF168 upon DNA damage and thereby marked for
degradation, allowing recruitment of 53BP1 to sites of DNA
damage (37). Thus, KDM4A overexpression could impair
DNA damage repair and induce genomic instability by
suppressing 53BP1 recruitment to DNA damage foci, another mechanism by which KDM4A possibly promotes tumorigenesis. In addition, KDM4A may affect DNA repair by
inhibiting the Tip60 acetyltransferase, which is involved in
the activation of the ataxia telangiectasia mutated kinase, a
key component of the DNA double-strand repair pathway.
Interestingly, Tip60 recognizes trimethylated H3K9 at DNA
double-strand breaks and is thereby activated, suggesting
that in this case, the catalytic activity of KDM4A is required
to demethylate H3K9me3 to exert an inhibitory effect on

Role of KDM4/JMJD2 Proteins in Cancer

Tip60-dependent DNA repair (38). The involvement of
KDM4A/KDM4B in DNA damage repair appears to be evolutionary conserved, as loss of C. elegans KDM4 led to more
DNA damage and altered progression of meiotic DNA double-strand break repair and heterozygous mutation of
KDM4B in Drosophila resulted in more sensitivity to UV
irradiation (9, 28, 39).

The Close Relatives: KDM4B/JMJD2B and
KDM4C/JMJD2C
KDM4B and KDM4C are structurally very similar to KDM4A
(Fig. 1A) and have the same target speciﬁcity and comparable
enzymatic activities in vitro (12, 13). However, earlier reports
indicated a much lower catalytic activity of KDM4B than other
KDM4 proteins (9, 40); it is currently unclear what the cause of
this discrepancy is, for instance, the use of differently sized
recombinant KDM4B proteins or dissimilar substrates to
measure catalytic activity. Phylogenetically, KDM4B and
KDM4C are present like KDM4A in all vertebrates studied,
whereas Drosophila has only 2 KDM4 homologs and C. elegans
just one (12).
Similar to KDM4A, KDM4B and KDM4C mRNA levels are
upregulated in breast tumors. Interestingly, KDM4B expression is higher in ER-positive than in ER-negative breast
tumors, whereas the opposite holds true for KDM4C (41–
43). In addition, KDM4B appears to be overexpressed in
triple-negative breast tumors (ref. 25; see also Supplementary Table S1). Like KDM4A, KDM4B formed complexes with
ER and stimulated transcription of ER target genes (36, 42).
Downregulation of KDM4B in ER-positive MCF7 or T47D
cells reduced cell proliferation and tumor formation in nude
mice, whereas no changes were reported for ER-negative
MDA-MB-231 cells upon KDM4B knockdown (36, 42, 44).
Further, KDM4C downregulation led to reduced proliferation of ER-negative HCC1954 and Colo24 breast cancer cells,
whereas its overexpression in nontransformed MCF10A cells
caused colony formation in soft agar and increased mammosphere formation, an indicator of cancer stem cells (41).
Notably, KDM4C is a target gene of the pluripotency factor
Oct4, and KDM4C downregulation induced the differentiation of embryonic stem cells (45), suggesting that KDM4C
overexpression is particularly important in cancer stem
cells. Collectively, KDM4C overexpression may contribute
to tumor formation in ER-negative breast tumors, whereas
KDM4B mediates neoplastic transformation of ER-positive
cells. The fact that KDM4B is an ER target gene (36, 42, 44)
lends further support to the view that KDM4B is involved in
the genesis of ER-positive tumors.
Also similar to KDM4A, KDM4C formed complexes with
and stimulated androgen receptor and promoted androgendependent growth of prostate cancer cells, thus implicating
KDM4C in prostate tumorigenesis (46). Evidence has
emerged that KDM4B and KDM4C are overexpressed in
prostate tumors and medulloblastomas (26, 47); in addition,
KDM4B is overexpressed in gastric, bladder, lung, and colorectal cancer and required for proliferation, colony formation ability, invasion, or survival of respective cell lines

www.aacrjournals.org

(refs. 48–50; see also Supplementary Table S1). Moreover,
the KDM4C gene was found to be translocated in mucosaassociated lymphoid tissue lymphoma, resulting in its overexpression (51). While all this furthers the notion of KDM4B
and KDM4C as oncoproteins, such evidence must be
regarded with caution, as KDM4B/C overexpression in
tumors may be a consequence rather than a cause of
tumorigenesis and changes of in vitro physiology upon
modulation of KDM4B or KDM4C levels in cancer cells are
no proof that KDM4B/C overexpression initiates or supports
tumor formation in the human body.
Maybe a more convincing case for KDM4C as an oncogene is present in primary mediastinal B-cell lymphoma and
Hodgkin lymphoma, where ampliﬁcation of the 9p24 chromosomal region has been found. KDM4C and the tyrosine
kinase JAK2 are encoded within this amplicon, and both
proteins are capable of epigenetic modulation, including
activation of the c-Myc oncogene. A potential mechanism is
the eviction of HP1 from the c-Myc promoter, as binding of
HP1 to trimethylated H3K9 or H1.4K26 would be inhibited
by KDM4C-dependent demethylation as well as by JAKmediated phosphorylation of H3Y41 that also suppresses
HP1 binding to chromatin. Moreover, inhibition of JAK2
and KDM4C synergized to kill primary mediastinal B-cell
and Hodgkin lymphoma cells (52). These genetic and
in vitro data combined provide a strong argument that, in
addition to JAK2, KDM4C is pro-oncogenic and a potential
drug target in these lymphomas. Notably, 9p24 ampliﬁcation has also been found in esophageal squamous cell
carcinomas, which coined the older name GASC1 (gene
ampliﬁed in squamous cell carcinoma 1) for KDM4C (53), as
well as in sarcomatoid carcinoma of the lung and desmoplastic medulloblastoma (54, 55), suggesting that KDM4C
may cooperate with JAK2 in many different tissues to
contribute to tumor formation.
Overexpression of KDM4A-C in the same cancer (e.g.,
prostate cancer) and similar physiologic functions in cancer
cells suggest that KDM4 proteins may conduct overlapping
functions. Moreover, the absence of obvious pathologic
phenotypes in KDM4B- as well as KDM4D-knockout mice
hints at redundancy within the KDM4 family (42, 56). However, KDM4 proteins can also behave differently. For
instance, hypoxia induced KDM4B and, to a lesser extent,
KDM4C transcription, whereas the KDM4A gene appeared
to be unaffected (57, 58). In fact, KDM4B was required for
increased transcription of many hypoxia-inducible genes in
colorectal cancer cell lines. Also, KDM4B was overexpressed
in colorectal cancer specimens that concurrently were positive for carbonic anhydrase 9, a marker of hypoxia, and
KDM4B overexpression was correlated with larger tumor
size and advanced clinical stage (50). In addition, KDM4C
bound to and stimulated hypoxia-inducible factor-1a, the
key transcription factor mediating the cellular response to
hypoxia (59). Therefore, KDM4B and/or KDM4C may help
tumors to thrive in a hypoxic environment. Another example
of differences among KDM4 proteins comes from the study
of the polycomb 2 protein (Pc2), which is associated with
heterochromatin formation and epigenetic silencing. Pc2

was shown to be dynamically methylated, and KDM4C was
the only member of the KDM4 family capable of demethylating Pc2. This demethylation of Pc2 led to the activation of
growth control genes, providing a distinct mechanism for
how KDM4C could facilitate tumorigenesis independent of
histone demethylation (60).

The Outlier: KDM4D/JMJD2D
KDM4D is unique within the KDM4 family in that it
lacks both the PHD and Tudor domains and thus is only
half the size of KDM4A-C (Fig. 1A). Phylogenetically, KDM4D
evolved recently, as it has only been found in placental
mammals (12). Bioinformatical analyses revealed the presence of 2 further human genes, KDM4E and KDM4F, whose
gene products are very similar to KDM4D. However, KDM4E
and KDM4F are most likely pseudogenes (9, 61). Furthermore, in contrast with KDM4A-C, KDM4D has a different
substrate speciﬁcity: It does not demethylate H3K36 owing
to several differences in its substrate binding cleft yet has
gained the ability to attack dimethylated in addition to
trimethylated H1.4K26 (9, 13, 62). Also, KDM4D attacks
H3K9me2 with similar efﬁciency as H3K9me3 and may, albeit
inefﬁciently, even demethylate H3K9me1 (11, 12, 63). Another difference of KDM4D is manifest in its association behavior: Whereas KDM4A and KDM4C homo- and heteromerize
among each other, KDM4D is only capable of forming
homomers (63).
Like KDM4A and KDM4C, KDM4D functioned as a coactivator of the androgen receptor (20). Also, like KDM4A,
KDM4D was required for colon cancer cell proliferation and
survival. However, in contrast with KDM4A being a repressor
of p53 transcriptional activity, KDM4D stimulated p53dependent gene expression (64). Whereas the stimulation of
the androgen receptor and colon cancer cell growth points to
a pro-oncogenic function, the role of KDM4D in activating
p53-dependent gene transcription would suggest the opposite, highlighting that further research is needed to resolve
the net effect, if any, of KDM4D in tumorigenesis.
Interestingly, the pro-inﬂammatory TNF-a induced KDM4D
expression in dendritic cells and macrophages. Moreover, the
ability of KDM4D to demethylate H3K9 was shown to be
involved in the TNF-a response (65). Therefore, KDM4D may
inﬂuence tumorigenesis not only in cancer cells but also
potentially in the tumor microenvironment and immune cells
by mediating inﬂammatory responses elicited by cytokines
such as TNF-a.

Therapeutic Implications and Perspective
Several lines of evidence suggest that enhanced catalytic
activity of KDM4 proteins is associated with cancer. If KDM4
proteins are indeed drivers of tumorigenesis, they represent
viable novel targets for cancer therapy. Many efforts are
under way or were already undertaken to design speciﬁc
KDM4 inhibitors, but their speciﬁcity and use as anticancer
drugs require rigorous preclinical testing in the future (66–
68). As a cautionary note, however, genetically engineered

2940

Cancer Res; 73(10) May 15, 2013

mouse models are needed to deﬁnitively prove that overexpression of KDM4 proteins is an underlying cause of
tumor formation. Also, such mouse models would represent
an invaluable tool for eventually testing KDM4 inhibitors
in vivo.
Apart from being histone demethylases, KDM4 proteins
are predicted to demethylate nonhistone proteins, and Pc2
was the ﬁrst such example (60). Many more nonhistone
proteins that are targeted by KDM4 proteins will likely be
discovered and thereby provide a deeper understanding of
how KDM4 proteins can contribute to cancer formation. Not
in the least, KDM4 proteins are dioxygenases and could
therefore hydroxylate lysine or asparagine residues, as
already shown for other JMJD proteins (6). Thereby, KDM4
proteins may regulate the function of a much broader
spectrum of proteins by affecting different kinds of posttranslational modiﬁcations. Also, as shown for the role of
KDM4A/B in the DNA damage response pathway (37) and
for many KDM4A target genes in Drosophila (32), there are
instances when KDM4 proteins act independently of their
enzymatic activity and thus inhibitors targeting their catalytic center would not completely shut down KDM4 biologic
activities. Another open question concerns the function of
the PHD domains in KDM4A-C: Do they, like the Tudor
domains, bind to speciﬁc histone modiﬁcations as observed
for other proteins (69), and how does this relate to the
function of KDM4 proteins?
Tumors often develop in a hypoxic environment, which is
a major limiting factor to their survival and proliferation.
Especially KDM4B is induced by hypoxia and involved in the
upregulation of hypoxia-inducible genes (44, 50, 57, 58).
Would inhibition of KDM4B therefore aggravate the
hypoxic tumor microenvironment, which could lead to
tumor necrosis? Also, as KDM4 proteins are O2-dependent
enzymes, is their catalytic activity suppressed by hypoxia
in tumors, and what physiologic consequences would that
have?
Finally, KDM4 proteins are 2-oxoglutarate–dependent
enzymes, so any perturbation of the endogenous 2-oxoglutarate pool will affect KDM4 activity. Or does overexpression of KDM4 deplete 2-oxoglutarate and thereby inhibit
other 2-oxoglutarate–dependent enzymes? It is known
that mutations of succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) and
fumarate hydratase (FH) found in various cancers impair
the Krebs cycle (Fig. 1C), leading to accumulation of
succinate that is an end-product inhibitor of JMJD proteins,
including KDM4A and KDM4D (70, 71). Moreover, cancerassociated mutations in isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH)
not only reduce the formation of 2-oxoglutarate but also
have gained a new catalytic activity of converting isocitrate to 2-hydroxyglutarate (Fig. 1C), which is an inhibitor
of KDM4 proteins (72). Thus, could KDM4 overexpression
be required in tumors to balance the inhibition of their
catalytic activity upon SDH, FH, or IDH mutation? Regardless, KDM4 activity appears to be intricately controlled by
the cancer metabolome, but an understanding of how this
will affect KDM4 function and cancer cells requires more
study.
