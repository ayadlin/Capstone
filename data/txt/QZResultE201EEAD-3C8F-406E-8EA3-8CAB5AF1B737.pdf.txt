BACKGROUND. A Phase II trial of irinotecan and cisplatin (IP) with early concurrent radiotherapy was performed in limited-disease small-cell lung cancer (LDSCLC) to evaluate the efficacy and toxicity.

METHODS. For untreated LD-SCLC patients, irinotecan (60 mg/m2, Days 1, 8, and
15) and cisplatin (40 mg/m2, Days 1 and 8) were repeated every 4 weeks for a
maximum of 6 cycles. Thoracic radiotherapy of 1.8 Gy/day was begun on Day 1
of the second chemotherapy cycle, up to a total of 45 to 54 Gy. Prophylactic
cranial irradiation (30 Gy in 10 fractions) was performed on patients with a complete response (CR).

RESULTS. Thirty-three LD-SCLC patients were enrolled. The median age was 60
years and 31 patients had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 to 1. Twelve (36.4%) patients had N3 disease. The response
rate was 87.9%, with a CR rate of 45.5%. At a median follow-up period of 27
months the median progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were
14.4 and 26.1 months, respectively, with 2-year PFS and OS rates of 26.8% and

mall-cell lung cancer comprises about 20% of all lung malignancies and chemotherapy, rather than surgery, plays a pivotal role
in the treatment. Limited-disease small-cell lung cancer (LD-SCLC)
is defined as a disease confined to 1 hemithorax, which is generally
regarded as potentially curable. For LD-SCLC, to date, concurrent
chemoradiotherapy based on an etoposide/cisplatin (EP) regimen
and early radiation treatment has been the standard protocol since
the early 1990s.1–5 In spite of the good response of tumors to chemoradiation, most patients still die as a result of systemic metastasis, with a median survival of 17–27 months and a 2-year survival
rate of 33% to 54%.4–7 Therefore, more effective systemic chemotherapy regimens are needed to improve patient outcomes for LDSCLC.
Irinotecan, a topoisomerase I inhibitor, showed a synergistic activity with cisplatin and seemed to be an active radiosensitizer in preclinical studies.8,9 Moreover, for extensive-disease small-cell lung

cancer (ED-SCLC), irinotecan was combined with cisplatin and showed a better survival than an EP regimen in a prospective Phase III randomized study.10
With this background, we conducted a trial of irinotecan and cisplatin (IP) with early concurrent chemoradiotherapy in order to evaluate the clinical
efficacy and toxicities in LD-SCLC.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Eligibility Criteria
LD-SCLC was defined as a tumor confined to 1 hemithorax where a primary tumor and regional nodes,
including ipsilateral supraclavicular nodes and contralateral hilar/mediastinal nodes, were included. Patients
with ipsilateral pleural effusion were regarded as LDSCLC and enrolled in this study. Patients with LDSCLC were eligible if the following criteria were met: 1)
age 18 years; 2) histologically or cytologically proven
SCLC; 3) Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG)
performance status of 2; 4) adequate bone marrow
(neutrophils 1.5 3 103/lL, platelets 100 3 103/lL,
and Hb 10.0 g/dL), renal (serum creatinine 1.5 3
upper normal limit), and liver function (serum bilirubin 1.5 3 upper normal limit and aspartate aminotransferase [AST] and alanine aminotransferase [ALT]
1.5 3 upper normal limit); 5) no previous chemo- or
radiotherapy; and 6) no history of other malignancies
excluding nonmelanoma skin cancer or carcinoma in
situ of the uterine cervix. All the patients were required
to provide written informed consent and this protocol
was approved by the institutional ethics committee.
Treatment Protocol
For pretreatment staging, chest x-ray, chest and abdominal computed tomography (CT) scan, and radionuclide bone scan were conducted within 4 weeks
before enrollment. Brain magnetic resonance imaging was performed only in symptomatic patients.
Irinotecan (60 mg/m2, 90-minute intravenous infusion on Days 1, 8, and 15) and cisplatin (40 mg/m2,
60-minute intravenous infusion on Days 1 and 8)
were administered every 4 weeks for a maximum of
6 cycles. Modifications of doses and dosing schedules were as follows: current chemotherapy was
omitted if grade 2 or worse hematologic toxicity
(neutropenia or thrombocytopenia) or grade 3–4
nonhematologic toxicity (eg, radiation pneumonitis
or esophagitis) was observed. The dose was reduced
at the subsequent week or cycle if hematologic toxicity was grade 3–4 or nonhematologic toxicity was
grade 2 or worse. In detail, when grade 3 or 4 hematologic toxicity was observed the next dose of irinotecan was reduced to 50 mg/m2 or 40 mg/m2, re-

spectively, with an unchanged dose of cisplatin. In
the case of grade 2–3 nonhematologic toxicity, the
next doses were reduced to irinotecan/cisplatin of
50/30 mg/m2. In the case of grade 4 nonhematologic
toxicity, the next doses were reduced to irinotecan/
cisplatin of 40/20 mg/m2.
Once-daily thoracic radiotherapy (TRT) of 1.8 Gy/
day was begun on Day 1 of the second chemotherapy
cycle, up to a total of 45 to 54 Gy. Postchemotherapy
treatment volumes were used for radiotherapy. The target volume included the lung tumor and involved
lymph nodes with a margin of 1.5 cm. Prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI) with a total of 30 Gy in 10 fractions was started in patients who achieved a complete
response (CR) within 2 weeks of completion of chemotherapy.
Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF)
was administered in the case of neutropenic fever.
Prophylactic G-CSF use was not permitted. Cholinergic symptoms including early diarrhea within 24
hours of irinotecan administration were treated with
atropine 1 mg intravenously. Loperamide was administered for late diarrhea 1 day to several days after
irinotecan administration in the following manner:
4 mg at the first onset of diarrhea, then 2 mg every
2 hours until diarrhea stopped for 12 hours.
Follow-up of the patients was performed at 1month intervals for the first year, at 3-month intervals for the second year, and at 6-month intervals
thereafter. Evaluations during these follow-up visits
included history taking, physical examination, complete blood count, biochemical profile, chest x-ray,
chest CT, abdominal CT scan, and bone scan.

Endpoints Evaluation
Response was assessed, using chest CT scan, abdominal CT scan, and/or bone scan after the first, third,
and sixth cycle of IP. Tumor response was classified
according to the Response Evaluation Criteria in
Solid Tumors11 as follows: CR, disappearance of all
target and nontarget lesions; partial response (PR), a
minimum of a 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions; progressive disease
(PD), a minimum of a 20% increase in the sum of
the longest diameter of target lesions, appearance of
1 or more new lesions, or unequivocal progression of
existing nontarget lesions; stable disease (SD), neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD. Patients who
achieved a response were required to take a confirmative CT scan at least 4 weeks later. Response duration was defined as the time from the first
documented day of response until disease progression or death. Progression-free survival (PFS) was

defined as the time from commencement of the treatment until disease progression or death. Overall survival (OS) was measured from the first date of the
treatment to death from any cause. Toxicity was
assessed weekly by history taking, physical examination, and complete blood count and monthly by biochemical profile and chest x-ray during the treatment.
The toxicity was graded based on the National Cancer
Institute’s Common Toxicity Criteria v. 3.0.12

Stastistical Considerations
The sample size was calculated by the Fleming single-stage design,13 based on an anticipated response
rate of 90%, threshold response rate of 65%, a 2sided significance level of 0.05, and a power of 0.8.
The minimum sample size was 28 and assuming a
10% of dropout rate, a final sample size was calculated to be 31 patients. All statistical calculations
were performed, using SPSS Windows program, v.
11.0 (SPSS, Chicago, Ill). Survival was estimated by
the Kaplan-Meier method. We measured the tumor
volumes before and after the first cycle of chemotherapy using CT scan and the paired t-test was used
for statistics.

RESULTS
Patients Characteristics
Thirty-three patients were enrolled in the study
between November 2002 and September 2005. The
median follow-up period was 27 months (range, 7.5–
41.4), as of April 20, 2006. All the patients had histologically confirmed small cell carcinoma with clinically limited stage. The median age was 60 years
(range, 38–76). Twenty-eight (84.8%) patients were
male. ECOG performance status was 0–1 in 31
(93.9%) and 2 in 2 (6.1%) patients. Twelve (36.4%)
patients had N3 disease: 9 had ipsilateral supraclavicular nodes involvement; 5 had contralateral hilar
nodes involvement; and 7 had contralateral mediastinal nodes involvement. Ipsilateral pleural effusion
was observed in 3 patients. The patient characteristics are summarized in Table 1.
Response
Of the 33 patients, 2 were not assessable for
response: 1 case was due to treatment-related death
and the other was removed from the study because
of the adverse event after the first cycle of chemotherapy without response evaluation. The response
rate was 87.9% (29/33 patients), with a CR rate of
45.5% (15/33 patients) according to the intent-totreat analysis. The median response duration was
13.1 months (95% confidence interval [CI]: 6.6–19.6).

Progression-Free and Overall Survival
At a median follow-up period of 27.0 months (range,
7.5–41.4), 17 of the 33 patients experienced disease
progression. The median PFS was 14.4 months (95%
CI: 10.3–18.5). The 1- and 2-year PFS rates were
54.1% and 26.8%, respectively. Over the same followup period, 16 of the 33 patients died and the median
OS was 26.1 months (95% CI: 9.0–43.2). The 1- and
2-year OS rates were 76.6% and 54.9%, respectively
(Fig. 1). Twelve patients died from disease progression and 2 from treatment-related sepsis and radiation pneumonitis, respectively. The remaining 2
patients died from treatment-unrelated bacterial
pneumonia and a traffic accident, respectively. Patients with N3 disease had lower 2-year PFS (0% vs
43.5% in patients without N3; P ¼ .093) and OS (40.0%
vs 65.5% in patients without N3; P ¼ .037) rates.
Toxicity Profiles
The dominating toxicity was neutropenia, of which a
grade 3–5 was observed in 81.8% (27/33 patients). The
most common grade 3–5 nonhematologic toxicities
were diarrhea (21.2%), anorexia (21.2%), and fatigue
(21.2%). Grade 3–5 radiation esophagitis and pneumonitis occurred in 6 (18.2%) and 3 (9.1%) patients,
respectively. There were 2 treatment-related deaths
from sepsis and radiation pneumonitis (Table 2).
Treatment Delivery and Dose Intensity
A total of 165 cycles of chemotherapy were delivered
and 20 (60.6%) of the 33 patients completed 6 cycles
of chemotherapy. Reasons for not completing chemotherapy were as follows: 5 disease progressions, 4

week and 20 mg/m2/week, respectively. The median
relative dose intensities for irinotecan and cisplatin
were 0.65 (range, 0.33–0.96) and 0.80 (range, 0.46–

received a dosage of only 750 cGy because of self-refusal. The remaining 3 patients could not receive
TRT due to early progression, death after first cycle
of chemotherapy, and self-refusal, respectively. PCI
was performed in 12 (80.0%) of the 15 CR patients.
Among the remaining 3 patients, 2 refused PCI and 1
died from radiation pneumonitis before PCI.

Patterns of First Failure and Salvage Chemotherapy
Among the 17 patients who had documented disease
progression, there were 5 locoregional failures alone,
5 distant metastases alone, and 7 both locoregional
and distant failures as the first failure. During the
whole follow-up period, brain metastasis occurred in
7 (21.2%) of 33 patients: 3 with PCI and 4 without
PCI (Table 3).
Twelve of the 17 patients who experienced disease progression received salvage chemotherapy.
Comparisons of Tumor Volumes at the Baseline
and After the First IP Chemotherapy
We compared tumor volumes at baseline and after
the first IP chemotherapy in 22 patients whose tumor
volumes could be measured by CT scan. Tumor
volumes were decreased in all but 1 patient after the
first IP chemotherapy. The median decrease of tumor
volume was 73.8% relative to the baseline volume
(P ¼ .000).

DISCUSSION
Topoisomerase I inhibitors and cisplatin showed
synergism in in vitro assays by increased interstrand
cross-linking (ICL), decreased DNA repair after ICL
formation, and enhanced topoisomerase I inhibitor
activity by cisplatin, as determined by the relaxation
of supercoiled DNA.8 Additionally, these 2 drugs do

not overlap in their dominating toxicities. As such,
combinations of these 2 drugs have been tested in
several clinical trials since the late 1990s.10,14,15
Although a recent confirmative Phase III trial16
reported a different result in contrast to a Japanese
study reported by Noda et al,10 regarding an IP regimen compared with EP regimen in ED-SCLC, we had
been encouraged to conduct this trial to evaluate irinotecan plus cisplatin with early concurrent TRT in
LD-SCLC based on the positive result of the study in
ED-SCLC at that time. We were further prompted by
a Phase I study that showed tolerability of the IP regimen with thoracic radiotherapy in LD-SCLC.17
The response rate (87.9%) and CR rate (45.5%) in
this study were similar or superior to rates in studies
using EP with TRT. Although this is a single-institution Phase II trial, the 2-year survival rate of 54.9%
with once-daily TRT is considerably more promising
over the previous results of the EP regimen-based
once daily or hyperfractionated concurrent radiotherapy studies (Table 4).4,6,15,18,19 Moreover, in this trial
patients with more advanced disease were included.
For example, patients with ipsilateral pleural effusion
and/or contralateral mediastinal nodes that had been
exclusion criteria in other studies4,6,15,18,19 accounted
for 24.2% of the total patient population in this
study.
Two Phase I trials of IP-based concurrent chemoradiotherapy have ever been reported: Yokoyama
et al.20 reported that they could not find a clinically
recommended dose of the IP regimen in unresectable stage III nonsmall-cell lung cancer because of
the toxicities such as leukopenia or diarrhea. In an
LD-SCLC trial reported by Oka et al.17 irinotecan/
cisplatin of 40/60 mg/m2 with split-course radiotherapy was recommended. In our study we did not

want to compromise the systemic dose of irinotecan/cisplatin in chemosensitive diseases such as
SCLC, just as with EP-based concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT). However, unlike the classic EPbased CCRT protocol, in which radiotherapy was
administered from the first cycle of chemotherapy,
we started with a full dose of IP chemotherapy, with
once-daily radiotherapy administered on the first day
of the second cycle of chemotherapy. This chemoradiotherapy schedule was aimed at reducing the tumor volume after the first cycle of chemotherapy.
Actually, tumor volumes decreased by a median of
73.8% relative to baseline volume after the first IP
chemotherapy and finally would lead to a decreased
radiation field and toxicity. Although hyperfractionated radiation has been a preferred strategy based
on a positive result in 1 large intergroup Phase III
study,6 TRT was administered once daily in this study
because the safety of hyperfractionated radiation
used concurrently with our IP regimen has not yet
been studied. Additionally, we adopted a strict dose
modification schedule so that we could continue the
radiotherapy to the end.
The median relative dose intensity was lower in irinotecan (0.65) vs cisplatin (0.80). The major reason for
irinotecan being delivered less than cisplatin was due
to neutropenia. However, TRT was completed in most
of the patients (87.9%). Although neutropenia was the
dominating toxicity, treatment-related death from
severe neutropenia was observed in only 1 patient. A
strict dose modification might improve this relatively
safe result. The rates of severe (grade 3) radiation
esophagitis (18.2%) and pneumonitis (9.1%) were comparable to the previous reports from EP-based concurrent chemoradiotherapy trials (Table 4).4,6,15,18,19

tively common, but was manageable in most cases
with antidiarrhetics.
Recently, an important association between genetic polymorphism in the uridine diphosphate glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) 1A1 and irinotecan
toxicity has emerged.21 UGT1A1 is known to inactivate the potent topoisomerase inhibitor SN-38, the
active metabolite of irinotecan.22 UGT1A1*28, a common polymorphism of UGT1A1, is significantly
higher in Caucasians than Asians.23 Therefore, the
toxicities of this regimen in the current study might
be more severe in Caucasians than Asian patients,
necessitating further trials for Caucasian patients.
Recently, a Phase II trial of irinotecan plus cisplatin
induction followed by concurrent twice-daily thoracic
irradiation with etoposide plus cisplatin chemotherapy
in patients with LD-SCLC was reported, with a promising efficacy (response rate, 97%; 2-year survival rate,
53.9%) and tolerability.15 Our study is the first Phase II
report that demonstrates that irinotecan/cisplatinbased chemoradiotherapy is also effective and tolerable in LD-SCLC.
In conclusion, IP with early concurrent radiotherapy was effective and tolerable in untreated LDSCLC.
