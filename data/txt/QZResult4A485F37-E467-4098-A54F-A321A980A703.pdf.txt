BACKGROUND. For patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the oral cavity, both
locoregional and distant recurrences are common, and an appropriate adjuvant
treatment modality has yet to be defined. Thus, there is an urgent need to identify novel molecular markers with potential prognostic and/or predictive value to
improve treatment outcome in these patients. This retrospective study was
designed to investigate the predictive and/or prognostic value of STAT1 activation
in squamous cell carcinoma of the oral cavity.

METHODS. STAT1 expression and subcellular localization was examined immunohistochemically on a tissue microarray of paraffin-embedded tumor specimens
from 89 patients who underwent surgical treatment in the period between 1980
and 1997. A nuclear staining score of greater than 35% was defined as high
STAT1 activation.

RESULTS. According to study criteria, 18% of analyzed tumor samples exhibited
high STAT1 activation. High STAT1 activation was associated with negative lymph
node status. Moreover, in the subgroup of patients who received chemotherapy,
high nuclear STAT1 staining in the tumor was associated with good prognosis.

CONCLUSIONS. This is the first report demonstrating the potential predictive
value of STAT1 activation status in patients with squamous cell cancer of the oral
cavity. If confirmed in large prospective trials, this molecular marker could help in
guiding therapeutic decisions in these patients. Cancer 2007;110:326–33.  2007

quamous cell carcinoma of the oral cavity, as a subgroup of
head and neck cancers, accounts worldwide for about 4% to 5%
of all carcinomas in men and 2% in women, with geographically
varying frequency.1,2 A high incidence of oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) has been reported in India,3 where chronic consumption of tobacco, especially the chewing of tobacco leaves, in
combination with alcohol abuse are essential etiological factors.4
Alcohol intake increases the permeability of the oral mucosa, which,
in turn, enhances carcinogenic effects of nitrosamines and polycyclic hydrogen contained in tobacco. Insufficient oral hygiene, chronic
pressure caused by dental prostheses, infection with papilloma virus, and chronic diseases (such as Plummer-Vinson-syndrome or
Lichen planus) are considered further etiological factors.5–7 Clinical
stage (according to American Joint Commission on Cancer TNM
classification) and tumor grade8 are established prognostic indicators for OSCC. Cervical lymph node metastases are rather common,

whereas distant metastases, involving especially the
lung, are seen in advanced stages of disease.9
Surgery is the primary therapy modality for both
early stage and locally advanced head and neck cancer, followed by radiotherapy.10 In the case of resectable OSCC, the use of adjuvant chemotherapy is
controversial: Some institutions propose the use of
neoadjuvant chemoradiation, whereas others follow
the surgery and/or radiotherapy alone concept.11,12
Established chemotherapy regimens contain a combination of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) with platinum-containing drugs, such as cisplatin and carboplatin.
During past years, various strategies combining
chemotherapy with radiotherapy were tested for their
capability to improve treatment outcome.13 In a
study on high-risk head and neck cancer patients,
chemotherapy in combination with radiation led to
significant improvement in local cancer control and
an increase in disease-free survival, but this combination failed to show an advantage in terms of overall survival.14,15 Improvements in local cancer control
with concurrent postoperative chemotherapy and
radiation therapy were described in some studies.16,17
However, a comparison of data that were obtained in
a nonrandomized study with OSCC patients treated
with surgery alone or adjuvant chemotherapy
revealed no evidence for improved cancer control or
disease-specific survival in patients who received adjuvant therapy.11,18 Similarly, a meta-analysis of adjuvant, neoadjuvant, and concomitant chemotherapy
for OSCC and other forms of head and neck cancer
revealed only a small survival benefit in favor of
chemotherapy.19 However, the heterogeneity of these
studies did not allow firm conclusions on this issue.
One hypothesis for the treatment of OSCC is that
only a fraction of patients with chemosensitive
tumors may benefit from chemotherapy. Responsiveness to chemotherapy may, in turn, depend on tumor phenotype. It would, therefore, be of interest to
find molecular markers that define this subpopulation of chemosensitive OSCC to specifically select
patients for adjuvant chemotherapy. The signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1) has
frequently been found to be constitutively activated
in a great variety of tumors,20 including head and
neck cancer,21,22 and has been implicated in triggering apoptosis and/or cell-cycle arrest.23 Effector
molecules that stimulate apoptotic action of STAT1
comprise the death receptor Fas,24 the death receptor
ligand TRAIL,25 2,5 oligoadenylate synthase, which
activates the tumor suppressor gene RNaseL,26 and
p21.22 Activation of STAT1 within the tumor can be
triggered by cell endogenous signaling pathways or
by autocrine or paracrine growth factors. Further-

more, STAT1 can be activated by immune cells that
secrete interferons, thus resulting in antitumor
immunosurveillance action.27 In this study, we investigated whether the activation status of STAT1 in
OSCC can serve as a predictive marker for response
to adjuvant chemotherapy.

MATERIAL AND METHODS
Patients
The study was conducted according to regulations of
the local ethics committee and Austrian Law. All
patients who underwent surgery between 1980 and
1997 at the Innsbruck Medical University Department of Maxillofacial Surgery and who had available
clinical follow-up data and tissue specimens from
the local pathology repository were included.
Seventy-nine (77.5%) were men, and twenty (22.5%)
were women. The median age was 63.3 years (range,
25.6 years–85.2 years). Fifty-five (61.8%) patients presented with the primary diagnosis of lymph nodepositive disease. Fifty-eight (64.0%) were classified
stage IV, 22 (24.8%) as stage III, 5 (5.6%) as stage II,
and 5 (5.6%) as stage I (Table 1). All patients underwent neck dissection and careful evaluation of

lymph-node status. The decision for adjuvant therapy was made according to individual considerations
based on performance status, patient compliance,
and clinicopathological features. Thirty-three (37.1%)
patients received 5-FU in combination with cisplatin
(25 patients), carboplatin (4 patients), and mitomycin
(4 patients) in 3 to 5 treatment cycles (Table 2).

Histopathology
All tumor samples were formalin-fixed, embedded in
paraffin, and stored at the local pathology repository.
From each tumor sample, a hematoxylin and eosinstained slide was prepared, by using routine methods, and then examined by light microscopy. Tumor
grade was assessed by 2 pathologists in a blinded
fashion by using standard pathology criteria. Low,
moderate, and high differentiation grade was
observed in 18 (20.2%), 47 (52.8%), and 24 (27%) of
patients, respectively.
Tissue Microarray (TMA)
For TMA construction, the pathologist (P.O.) used hematoxylin and eosin-stained slides from each tumor
block to select morphologically representative tumor
area. Tissue cylinders with a diameter of 2 mm were
punched from the marked tumor areas of each block
(donor block) and brought into a recipient paraffin
block (recipient block) by using a precision instrument (Manual Tissue Arrayer, MTA-1, Beecher Instruments, Sun Prairie, Wis). Three different TMAs were
constructed, each containing about 30 punches of
oral squamous cell carcinoma in a specific array pattern. Sections from these blocks were cut with a
microtome and mounted on TMA-specific, adhesivecoated, glass slides, which were used for immunohistochemical analysis.
Immunohistochemistry
The expression of STAT1 was determined by immunohistochemistry by using a rabbit polyclonal antibody directed against Stat1a p91 at a dilution of
1:100 (C-24, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz,

Calif). Sections measuring 5 mm were cut from recipient paraffin blocks, mounted on micro tissue arrayspecific, adhesive-coated, glass slides (Instrumedics,
St. Louis, Mo), deparaffinized, and rehydrated. Endogenous peroxidase was blocked with methanol
containing 3% hydrogen peroxide for 20 minutes.
Slides were then incubated with peroxidase-conjugated goat antimouse antibody (EnVision; Dako,
Vienna, Austria) for 60 minutes and treated with
chromogen diaminobenzidine in a solution containing 3% hydrogen peroxide. Finally, slides were counterstained with Mayer’s Hemalum solution and
rinsed with water. Representative micrographs of
tumors with predominant nuclear or cytoplasmic
staining of STAT1 are shown in Figure 1. As a positive
control for cells that contained a high proportion of
activated STAT1 in the nucleus, T47D mammary carcinoma cells were treated with 10 ng/mL human IFN
alpha (Preprotech EC, London, UK) for 20 minutes in
culture and compared with cells that remained
untreated and that contained only a small percentage
of nuclear STAT1. Cells were then washed with phosphate-buffered saline, scraped from the tissue plate,
formalin-fixed, embedded in paraffin, and processed
for immunohistochemistry in the same way as the
micro tissue array.

Evaluation of Slides
The fraction of cells with specific staining of the nucleus was determined as a measure for STAT1 activation. The sections were observed under a light
microscope individually by 2 pathologists who were
not aware of the clinical characteristics of the
patients. By using high magnification power (3400),
the 4 fields of each punched representative tumor
section were evaluated. In total, 50 tumor cells were
counted in each field. The percentage of immunoreactive tumor cells with nuclear staining ranged from
0 to 70%. The mean was determined as an optimal
cutoff value to separate high and low STAT1 activation categories, thus, tumors with STAT1 staining in
greater than 35% of the nuclei were considered to
exhibit high STAT1 activation, whereas those with
35% and less were scored as tumors with low STAT1
activation.
Statistical Methods
All calculations and the statistical analyses were performed by using the statistical software program
SPSS for Windows (SPSS, Inc. Chicago, Ill). Differences between groups were examined for statistical
significance by using the chi-square test. Survival
curves were calculated according to the method of
Kaplan and Meier. For this method, P values were

evaluated by the log-rank test for censored survival
data. Follow-up time was censored if the patient was
lost during follow-up. The significance of various parameters for survival was analysed by the Cox proportional hazards model. The final model adjusted
for tumor grade, clinical stage, lymph-node metastasis (positive vs negative), and STAT1 activation status.
Correlations between parameters were assessed
according to the Spearman nonparametric test. For
all analyses a P value of <.05 was defined as statistically significant.

RESULTS
The median overall survival in this study cohort was
20.8 months (range, 1 month to 245 months). Forty-

seven (52.8%) patients received adjuvant therapy. Tumor grade (P < .008) and clinical stage (P 5 .037),
but not STAT1 activation status (P 5 .108), were predictors of survival in the entire patient cohort. There
was a tendency toward longer survival for lymph
node-negative patients. However, in contrast to other
studies in head and neck cancer patients, this did
not reach statistical significance, which may be
because of the relatively small number of patients in
the study. In a multivariate Cox regression model,
only tumor grade was statistically significant (hazard
ratio [HR], 1.65; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.13–
2.39; P 5 .009). STAT1-activation was assessed by
immunohistochemistry as described in the Methods
section through evaluation of the percentage of cells
with nuclear STAT1. Sixteen (18%) of the analyzed tu-

mor samples were classified as tumors with high
STAT1 activation. Representative examples for the
immunohistochemical staining of tumors with either
low or high STAT1 activation are shown in Figure 1.
Characteristics of the study population segregated by STAT1 activation are shown in Table 1. Lowgrade tumors tended to have a higher rate of STAT1
activation and were associated with good prognosis.
High STAT1 activation was associated with negative
lymph node status (Table 1; P 5 .001). There was neither a positive nor a negative correlation between
epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) expression
levels, as determined in a previous study,28 and nuclear STAT1 levels (data not shown). This is in contrast to the findings with STAT3, where a positive
correlation between STAT3 activation and EGFR
expression has been described.29
We further evaluated the correlation of STAT1
activation with overall survival in different treatment
groups of patients who were receiving adjuvant
chemotherapy, radiotherapy, both treatment modalities, or no adjuvant therapy. The numbers of
patients in each of these subgroups are shown in Table 2. Strikingly, STAT1 activation was a significant
predictor for better survival in patients who received
adjuvant chemotherapy (HR, 0.3; 95% CI, 0.1–0.92;
P 5 .03). This suggests that the determination of
STAT1-activation status in the tumor enables identification patients who have an increased likelihood of
responding to chemotherapy. The correlation of

STAT1 activation and good prognosis was confined
to patients who were receiving adjuvant chemotherapy and was not observed for the group of patients
who were not receiving chemotherapy (Fig. 2). This
explains the lack of statistically significant correlations between STAT1 and survival in the entire
patient cohort (Table1).
When stratification for STAT1-activation status
was not applied, chemotherapy did not prove to be
of benefit to patient survival. This is in accord with
previous studies that have demonstrated no favorable effect of neoadjuvant chemotherapy on patient
survival.14 It should be noted that in the subgroup of
patients with low STAT1 activation, administration of
chemotherapy even slightly decreased overall survival. Although this effect did not reach statistical
significance, the results suggest that treatment of
patients with low STAT1 activation by chemotherapy
may be inefficient.

DISCUSSION
So far, decisions on therapeutic modalities for
patients with SCC of the oral cavity are mainly influenced by node status, histological features, local
extension, and patient performance status. However,
these clinicopathological parameters do not sufficiently predict response to chemotherapy. This has
promoted extensive investigation into a great variety
of tissue biomarkers for their suitability as molecular

STAT1 in Oral Squamous Cell Carcinoma/Laimer et al.

indicators of clinical outcome in patients.30 However,
an appropriate marker to predict response to chemotherapy has not been described so far.
In a high percentage of SCC of the head and
neck region (SCCHN), the EGFR is overexpressed in
an early stage of carcinogenesis.21 Stimulation of
EGFR by an autocrine TGF-a signal results in activation of STAT3.29 Sustained activation of the EGFR
pathway together with inactivation of the endogenous STAT3 inhibitor SOCS-3 by methylation31
appear to be important for the constitutive STAT3
activation found in the majority of SCCHN cancers.29
A preceding study at our institution revealed that
EGFR is also frequently overexpressed in the same
patient material described in our present study and
that high expression represents a prognostic marker
that predicts low overall survival.28 STAT3 activation
has been shown to be crucial for tumor growth in
animal models of SCCHN, and inhibition of STAT3
activity is an interesting therapeutic option.32–34
However, there are no data that suggest usefulness of
STAT3 as a marker to predict response to conventional chemotherapy in SCCHN patients.
In contrast to STAT3, STAT1 expression and activation are usually associated with growth inhibition
and apoptosis in tumors. This notion appears to also
be relevant for head and neck cancer: Higher STAT1
expression levels were found in well differentiated
compared with poorly differentiated tumors.35 Furthermore, as shown in our study, STAT1 activation
also was predominantly observed in tumors with a
high differentiation grade. Moreover, an important
role for STAT1 as a tumor suppressor in SCCHN carcinogenesis has been suggested by a recent study
that demonstrated decreased STAT1 expression as a
result of promoter methylation and a growth inhibitory effect of STAT1 overexpression in cell lines
derived from SCCHN.22 Finally, we show here that
patients with squamous cell cancer of the oral cavity,
who have retained STAT1 expression and exhibit
STAT1 activation in their tumor, respond better to
adjuvant 5-FU/platinum-based chemotherapy. By
contrast, without adjuvant chemotherapy, patients
with high STAT1 activation did not have significantly
better outcomes in terms of relapse of disease or survival. This suggests that high STAT1 activation can
sensitize the tumor to 5-FU/platinum-based chemotherapy.
Which molecular mechanisms are likely to be responsible for enhanced chemosensitivity of STAT1
positive cancer cells? One line of evidence indicates
synergism between proapoptotic signaling pathways
triggered by chemotherapeutic drugs and STAT1. In
tumor cell lines, type I interferons activate STAT1

331

and synergistically induce apoptosis with chemotherapeutic drugs such as 5-FU and doxorubicin.36,37
Most interestingly, apoptosis induction in SCCHNderived tumor cells lines by cisplatin was enhanced
after treatment of cells with the demethylating drug
azacytidine, which increased STAT1 and p21 expression.22 Furthermore, the actions of the topoisomerase
inhibitor CPT-11 (irinotecan) and the antifolate raltitrexed were shown to be dependent on STAT1
expression.38
Cell-cycle checkpoint pathways are another site
of interaction between STAT1 and chemotherapeutic
agents: Many chemotherapeutic drugs, including 5FU and platinum-containing compounds, act by
inducing DNA damage and genotoxic stress,39,40 and
they activate Ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM)triggered and Ataxia telangiectasia, Rad3-related
(ATR)-triggered cell-cycle checkpoint pathways as
part of their antitumor action.41 Activation of these
cell-cycle checkpoints promotes DNA repair of the
damaged cells. In case DNA repair is not possible,
these checkpoints initiate apoptosis to remove
damaged cells.39 Another report demonstrated that
STAT1 is required for the transcriptional up-regulation of 2 important mediators of ATM checkpoint
activation, 53BP1 and MDC1,42 suggesting the hypothesis that STAT1 can enhance the action of DNAdamaging drugs by its influence on the ATM checkpoint pathway.
A third intriguing explanation of why patients
with activated STAT1 in the tumor may benefit from
chemotherapy is its role as an immunomodulator:
STAT1 has been found to be an indicator and possible
mediator of response to immunotherapy.27 In accord
with this notion, loss of STAT1 activation in tumors
has been demonstrated to be part of an immune
escape mechanism of aggressive tumor variants.43
Because some chemotherapeutic drugs can augment
antitumor immune responses,44 it is tempting to
speculate that OSCCs with activated STAT1 respond
better to chemotherapy, because STAT1 signaling promotes immunosurveillance mechanisms. Patients
with low STAT1 expression of the tumor did obviously
not benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy with 5-FU
and platinum drugs (Fig. 2). This could be the result
of a defective ATM checkpoint pathway, requiring
STAT1 signaling,42 leading to an increased accumulation of drug-induced mutations. It remains to be seen
whether these patients experience a tumor. Indeed,
STAT1 knock-out mice are more likely to form tumors
in response to chemotherapeutic drugs.45
In summary, this is the first report of an investigation of the role of STAT1 activation for response to
5-FU/platinum adjuvant chemotherapy in patients

332

with OSCC. In our retrospective study, STAT1 activation was a potent predictor for response to chemotherapy. However, it has to be noted that treatment
protocols of included patients were not completely
uniform in terms of the use of platinum compounds,
and the number of patients who received adjuvant
chemotherapy was limited. We, therefore, conclude
that determination of STAT1 activation could be
potentially useful as a predictive clinical marker. The
hypothesis generated in the current study has to be
further validated by prospective, randomized, clinical
trials.
