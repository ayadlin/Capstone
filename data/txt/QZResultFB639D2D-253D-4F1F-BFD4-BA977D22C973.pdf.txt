Macro-autophagy is associated with drug resistance in various cancers and can function as an adaptive response to maintain cell
survival under metabolic stresses, including androgen deprivation. Androgen deprivation or treatment with androgen receptor (AR)
signaling inhibitor (ARSI), Enzalutamide (MDV-3100, ENZA) or bicalutamide induced autophagy in androgen-dependent and in
castration-resistant CaP (castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC)) cell lines. The autophagic cascade triggered by AR blockage,
correlated with the increased light chain 3-II/I ratio and ATG-5 expression. Autophagy was observed in a subpopulation of C4-2B
cells that developed insensitivity to ENZA after sustained exposure in culture. Using ﬂow cytometry and clonogenic assays, we
showed that inhibiting autophagy with clomipramine (CMI), chloroquine or metformin increased apoptosis and signiﬁcantly
impaired cell viability. This autophagic process was mediated by AMP-dependent protein kinase (AMPK) activation and the
suppression of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) through Raptor phosphorylation (Serine 792). Furthermore, small
interfering RNA targeting AMPK signiﬁcantly inhibited autophagy and promoted cell death in CaP cells acutely or chronically
exposed to ENZA or androgen deprivation, suggesting that autophagy is an important survival mechanism in CRPC. Lastly, in vivo
studies with mice orthotopically implanted with ENZA-resistant cells demonstrated that the combination of ENZA and autophagy
modulators, CMI or metformin signiﬁcantly reduced tumor growth when compared with control groups (Po 0.005). In conclusion,
autophagy is as an important mechanism of resistance to ARSI in CRPC. Antiandrogen-induced autophagy is mediated through the
activation of AMPK pathway and the suppression of mTOR pathway. Blocking autophagy pharmacologically or genetically
signiﬁcantly impairs prostate cancer cell survival in vitro and in vivo, implying the therapeutics potential of autophagy inhibitors
in the antiandrogen-resistance setting.

INTRODUCTION
Progression to castration resistance is almost universal in patients
with metastatic prostate cancer after a period androgendeprivation therapy. Castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC)
continues to account for >28 000 deaths each year in the
United States. Studies have demonstrated that persistent androgen receptor (AR) signaling remained the key driver in the
progression to CRPC. CRPC cells acquired the ability to activate AR
signaling either through AR gene ampliﬁcation, AR mutation,
constitutively active AR splice variants or increased intratumor
androgen production in the setting of androgen-deprivation
therapy. New generation of AR signaling inhibitors (ARSIs),
Enzalutamide (MDV-3100, ENZA), a small molecule with multiple
effects on androgen signaling, including blockage of testosterone
binding to AR, preventing AR nuclear translocation and DNA
binding, and interfering with co-activator recruitment, gave
patients who failed docetaxel a 4.8-month survival beneﬁt over
placebo in the AFFIRM Phase III trial.1 It is also known that not all
patients responded to the new generation of ARSIs and continued
to progress and die from the disease. Finding the mechanism of
resistance to the new ARSI therapy and aiming at delaying the

progression of CRPC has been the objectives of many laboratories,
including ours.
Numerous mechanisms of resistance or survival in which
prostate cancer cells use to counter the effects of androgen
ablation or antiandrogen therapy have been described.2 Autophagy or self-eating is a catabolic process that is activated in
response to stresses, allowing cells to use the lysosomal-mediated
degradation of cellular proteins and organelles to regenerate
energy. Autophagy is constitutively active in cells at a basal level
to help maintain cellular homeostasis by eliminating aged cellular
components. Cancer cells use autophagy to prolong their survival
under harsh conditions of metabolic stress in the tumor
microenvironment induced by chemotherapy, ionizing radiation,
nutritional starvation, oxidative stress or growth factor
deprivation.3 On the other hand, excessive or deregulated
autophagy can push the cells toward autophagic cell death or
type-II programmed cell death and is thought to have a role in
tumor suppression. Modulating autophagy has recently been
exploited as a molecular target to improve cancer therapy.
Regulation of autophagy involves multiple pathways: (1) under
nutrient-rich conditions, the phosphatidylinositol 3′ kinase (PI3K;

type I)/Akt pathway inhibits autophagy through the activation of
mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR); (2) under nutrient or
growth factor-deprived or hypoxic conditions, autophagy is
activated by the AMPK (AMP-dependent protein kinase) pathway,
leading to the upregulation of transcription of autophagy genes as
well as the suppression of mTOR/S6K/4EBP activity by phosphorylation of TSC2.4 The activation of AMPK as well as the suppression
of PI3K/AKT/ mTOR are the main triggers of autophagy induction,
leading to the multistep process of autophagosome formation
around cellular organelles targeted for degradation. The autophagosome then fuses with lysosomes where contents are degraded
into amino acid, fatty acid and nucleotides to be reused. The
autophagosome is formed by Atg5 and Atg12 conjugation, which
then recruits microtubule-associated protein light chain 3-II (LC3II) for insertion into autophagosome membranes. The LC3- eGFPtransgene has been exploited to provide a reliable visual marker
to detect autophagic process.4
Accumulating evidence showed that targeting autophagy alone
or in combination with chemotherapy has been effective at
enhancing cell death and improved the efﬁcacy of the cancer
therapies in a variety of cancer types.3 Our group has previously
shown that inhibiting autophagy enhances cell-killing effects of
Src inhibitors in CaP.5 We hypothesized that autophagy is a
survival mechanism that prostate cancer cells used to evade the
insult of androgen deprivation or antiandrogen therapy, including
the new generation of ARSI, ENZA. Inhibiting autophagy as a
molecular target could overcome resistance to ENZA therapy
in CRPC.
Previous studies by Jiang et al.6 demonstrated that knocking
down AR in LNCaP or CWR22Rv1 led to increased autophagy. Androgen deprivation in the setting of hypoxia also induced
autophagy.7,8 Most recently, Boutin et al.9 demonstrated that
androgen deprivation or treatment with bicalutamide in LNCaP
cells induced autophagy and inhibiting autophagy by small
interfering RNA (siRNA) to ATG-5 sensitized LNCaP cells to
bicalutamide-induced apoptosis. However, the mechanism of
antiandrogen-induced autophagy is still poorly understood. The
question of whether autophagy has an important role in
mediating resistance to the new ARSI ENZA has not been
elucidated in vitro or in vivo.
In the present study, we showed that blocking AR axis by
androgen deprivation or treatment with ARSI ENZA or bicalutamide induced autophagy in androgen-dependent and in CRPC cell
lines. Autophagy was observed in a subpopulation of C4-2B cells
that developed insensitivity to ENZA after sustained exposure in
culture. This autophagic process was mediated by AMPK
activation and the suppression of mTOR through Raptor
phosphorylation (Serine 792). Furthermore, siRNA targeting AMPK
signiﬁcantly inhibited autophagy and promoted cell death in CaP
cells acutely or chronically exposed to ENZA or androgen-deprived
culturing condition, suggesting that autophagy is an important
survival mechanism in CRPC. Lastly, in vivo studies with mice
orthotopically implanted with ENZA-resistant cells demonstrated
that the combination of ENZA and autophagy modulators clomipramine (CMI) or metformin signiﬁcantly reduced tumor growth
when compared with control groups.

RESULTS
AR signaling inhibition by ENZA induces autophagy in both
androgen-responsive and CRPC cells
To determine whether both androgen responsive (LNCaP) and
androgen insensitive (CWR22Rv1) cell lines undergo autophagy
during AR signaling inhibition by ENZA, both cell lines stably
introduced with LC3-eGFP were treated with 10 μM of ENZA.
LC3-I in cells is localized in the cytosol, but upon induction of
autophagy, it is lipidated into LC3-II and inserted into

autophagosome membrane and can readily be detected and
visualized by the prominent change from diffuse cytoplasmic to
bright, punctate ﬂuorescence in the cytosol as shown in Figure 1a.
Additional evidence of ENZA-induced autophagy in LNCaP and
CWR22Rv1 cells came from western blotting analysis as demonstrated by the signiﬁcant increase in the LC3-I to LC3-II conversion
(LC3-II/I ratio increased from 0.71 to 1.36) and the increased
expression of ATG 5, both have been used as reliable markers of
autophagy (Figure 1b).4 Flow cytometry was used to measure and
quantify increase of autophagosome formation upon ENZA
treatment as shown in Figure 1c. To model resistance to ENZA
in vivo, C4-2B cells were treated with ENZA at 20 μM for a period of
3 months and selected for cells that survived after this prolonged
drug exposure. ENZA-resistant C4-2B cells were examined for
the presence of autophagy using acridine orange staining and
western blotting analysis. As showed in Figure 1d, cells resistant to
chronic ARSI by ENZA displayed an increased level of basal
autophagy. C4-2B+R cells also harbored a higher LC3-II/I ratio than
the parental cells. These C4-2B+R cells retain the same T877A
mutation in AR as in their parental LNCaP line but not F876L
mutation as in the other spontaneous ENZA-resistant LNCaP cells
(data not shown).10 Transcriptome deep sequencing of parental
and ENZA-resistant C4-2B cells was carried out to examine
differential gene expression pattern that may be related to their
ability to survive under constant high exposure to ARSI. More
than 140 genes were upregulated and >100 genes were downregulated, (3 FPKM (fragments per kilobase of exon per million
mapped fragments) = 1 transcript/cell). Figure 1e showed examples of upregulated genes involved in autophagosome formation
as expected in the ENZA-resistant cells. Suppression of mTOR
signaling is also a major inducer of autophagy. We observed
several mTOR signaling genes that were differentially downregulated in the resistant cells when compared with the parental
cells (expression levels are expressed in FPKM with 3 FPKM = 1
transcript/cell).
AR signaling inhibition-mediated autophagy is a class effect
To answer the question whether ENZA-mediated autophagy is a
speciﬁc effect or can be seen with other ARSI therapy such
as bicalutamide, we subjected LNCaP and C4-2B cells to
both ENZA and bicalutamide treatment and examined for
autophagic induction. Figure 2a shows representative western
blotting analysis of LNCaP and C4-2B cell lines treated with
DMSO (dimethyl sulfoxide; vehicle control), 5 μM CMI, 10 μM ENZA,
combination of CMI and ENZA, 10 μM bicalutamide and a
combination of bicalutamide and CMI for 48 h, and cells treated
with 2 μM rapamycin for 4 h were used as a positive control. Both
ARSI agents elicited autophagy as indicated by the transition of
LC3-1 to LC3-II, comparable to that in the rapamycin-treated
positive control. Addition of the late autophagy inhibitor CMI arrested the fusion of autophagosome to lysosome to
the completion of autophagy and displayed even higher LC3-II/I
ratios. To make certain that autophagy was induced via AR
inhibition, PC3 cell line lacking detectable expression of AR were
subjected to similar treatment under serum-free and full medium.
As shown in Figure 2b, exposure of AR-negative PC3 cells to ENZA
had no effect on the LC3-I to LC3-II conversion, suggesting that
ENZA-mediated autophagy is speciﬁc to AR inhibition.
AMPK is activated by AR inhibition
The activation of AMPK and the suppression of PI3K/AKT/mTOR
signaling have been implicated in androgen deprivation-mediated
autophagy.7 To determine the predominate mechanism involved
in ARSI-mediated autophagy, we subjected C4-2B and LNCaP cells
to both bicalutamide and ENZA treatment and analyzed for
phosphorylated AMPK and AKT. As shown in Figure 3a, activation
of AMPK signiﬁcantly increased in cells treated with ARSI, whereas

FPKM (3 FPKM = 1 transcript/cell). Examples of genes involved in autophagosome formation and mTOR signaling are shown.

the level of phosphorylated AKT is minimally affected (data not
shown). We next evaluated AMPK phosphorylation in cells that
conferred resistant to ARSI, namely C4-2B and C4-2B+R cells.

was not observed in cells with diminished level of AMPK
expression as evidenced by the lack of green ﬂuorescence
punctate, compared with the bright punctate ﬂuorescence in
cells transfected with the scrambled control (Figure 4a). The same
cells were subjected to western blotting analysis using antiphospho-AMPK antibodies, verifying that AMPK is effectively
knocked down (Figure 4b).

Knockdown of AMPK in LNCAP and C4-2B cells blocks the
induction of autophagy
To prove the principle that activation of the AMPK pathway is
responsible to the induction of autophagy mediated by ARSI, we
used interference RNA to knock down the expression of AMPK in
C4-2B cells and subsequently treated them with ENZA. Autophagy

Figure 2. Antiandrogen-mediated autophagy is a class effect.
(a) Representative western blotting analysis of LNCaP and C4-2B
cell lines were treated with DMSO, 5 μM CMI, 10 μM ENZA,
combination of CMI and ENZA, 10 μM bicalutamide and a combination of bicalutamide and CMI for 48 h, and 2 μM rapamycin for 4 h
were used as a positive control. Cell lysates were harvested and
subjected to western blotting analysis using autophagy markers,
LC3-I and LC3-II. (b) Western blotting analysis of AR-negative PC3
cells treated with DMSO (vehicle control) and 10 μM ENZA in both
normal serum and serum-free conditions.

Cells with knockdown expression of AMPK were treated with
vehicle and ENZA and then probed for phosphorylated Raptor,
speciﬁcally detecting the phosphorylation of S792. As shown in
Figure 5a, in the presence of ENZA and intact AMPK expression,
phosphorylated Raptor level increased signiﬁcantly, resulting in
the consequential downregulation of pS6 and increased LC3-I to
LC3-II conversion, whereas p-AKT remained unaffected. When
AMPK was effectively knocked down, ENZA treatment did not
affect the phospho-Raptor or phospho-S6 levels. These observations also correlated with reduced ATG-5 expression and reduced
conversion of LC3-I to LC3-II. Hence, our data suggest the
interaction between AMPK activation and suppression of mTOR
via phosphorylation of Raptor at Serine 792 upon induction of
ARSI-mediated autophagy. To conﬁrm this interaction, we
performed co-immunoprecipitation assays by pulling down the
mTOR complex with anti-mTOR antibodies in the presence/
absence of AMPK and ENZA. As shown in Figure 5b, we could only
detect phospho-Raptor in the mTOR complex when AMPK was
activated by ENZA treatment. Phospho-Raptor was undetectable
in control conditions and when AMPK expression was knocked
down, indicating a direct interaction between AMPK activation
and mTOR suppression via phospho-Raptor in ARSI-induced
autophagy.
Knockdown of AMPK overcomes ENZA resistance
As AMPK signaling appeared to be the upstream to ARSI-induced
autophagy, we postulate that knocking down AMPK will
effectively deprive the CRPC cells of their ability to undergo
autophagy and promote apoptosis. LNCaP and C4-2B cells were
transiently transfected with siRNA targeting AMPK and treated
with ENZA. As shown in Figure 6a, cell cycle analysis using
ﬂuorescence-activated cell sorter indicated an increase in cell
death, represented by the increased cell population in Sub-G1

Figure 3. (a) AMPK is activated with AR blockage. LNCaP and C4-2B
cell lines were treated with DMSO, 5 μM CMI, 10 μM ENZA,
combination of CMI and ENZA, 10 μM bicalutamide and a combination of bicalutamide and autophagy inhibitor CMI for 48 h. Cell
lysates were harvested and subjected to western blotting analysis
using autophagy markers LC3-I and LC3-II and antibodies to
phospho-AMPK and total AMPK. (b) Androgen deprivation and
continuous androgen blockage by ENZA induces autophagy and
activates AMPK phosphorylation. Left panel shows representative
western analysis of C4-2B cells cultured under regular FBS

phase. Similar ﬁndings were observed in the androgen-deprived
condition. Next, we tested this hypothesis on ENZA-resistant cells
C4-2B+R. Data in Figure 6b showed enhanced cell killing when
AMPK was knocked down in the ENZA-resistant cells. The data
support the notion that once the upstream signal for autophagy
induction is suppressed, the ENZA-resistant cells become
re-sensitized to ARSI-induced cell death.
Inhibiting autophagy pharmacologically overcomes ENZA
resistance and enhanced therapeutic response in vitro and in vivo
using prostate xenograft mouse model
To provide an implication for therapeutic potential, we asked the
question whether blocking autophagy would overcome ENZA
resistance in vitro and in vivo. Clonogenic assays were used to
evaluate cell ability to form colonies in the presence of an
autophagy inhibitor CMI. CMI is an Food and Drug Administration
(FDA)-approved drug to treat depression and has been shown
to be a potent inhibitor of autophagy with little toxic affects both
in vitro and in vivo.14,15 Colony formation in cells treated with
ENZA or CMI alone was slightly reduced compared with control
but was markedly impaired in the combined treatment. Their
proliferative potential was also markedly reduced, based on the
size of the colonies as shown in Figure 7a. To address our
hypothesis that targeting autophagy could overcome resistant
to ENZA therapy in CRPC in an in vivo model, we used SCID
mice and orthotopically implanted ENZA-resistant cells into the
prostate. Prostate-speciﬁc antigen (PSA) level was monitored
until detectable around day 10, indicating tumor implantation.

and cell lysates were analyzed by immunoblotting with antibodies as indicated. Controls were treated with vehicle alone. β-Actin was
detected as the loading control. (b) Under similar condition, C4-2B cells were incubated with (+) or without ( − ) ENZA for 72 h after
transfection with siRNA, lysed and collected for immunoprecipitation (IP) with anti-mTOR antibody or with rabbit IgG as a control. Equal
amounts of IP complex were loaded and resolved by SDS–PAGE and probed for the presence of phospho-Raptor at Serine 792 in the mTOR/
Raptor immunocomplex with anti-phospho-Raptor polyclonal antibody, as shown in the bottom panel. The positions of heavy-chain (HC) and
light-chain (LC) IgG were also indicated. The knockdown of AMPK in the cell lysate was further veriﬁed by blotting the total lysate with antiphospho-AMPK antibody, as shown in the upper panel.

Treatments with control vehicles, CMI, ENZA and combination
were dosed daily. At the end of 6 weeks after surgery, tumors
were harvested and weighed. Mice treated with ENZA or CMI
alone showed a 28% and 23% decrease in tumor size
when compared with control mice, respectively. There were a
signiﬁcant reduction in tumor size by 91% in mice treated with
ENZA in combination with the autophagy inhibitor CMI when
compared with control mice, as shown in Figure 7b (P o0.001).

Because of the elevated interest of metformin also as an
autophagy modulator and its low toxicity and applicability, we
conducted another in vivo study replacing CMI with metformin.
Mice treated with ENZA or metformin produced marginally
reduced tumor sizes than the control mice, while those treated
with the combination of ENZA and metformin gave a drastic
78% reduction with a signiﬁcant difference (P ⩽ 0.01 by the
Student’s t-test).

DISCUSSION
The suppression of AR signaling continues to be important in
optimizing therapy to treat or delay CRPC progression. However,
CRPC cells are able to adapt and exploit survival mechanisms to
counter the effects of ARSI, thus rendering the therapy ineffective
after the initial response.10,16–18 In this report, we describe the
novel observation that CRPC cells resort to autophagy as an
escape mechanism to evade ARSI, even with the new generation
therapy, ENZA. Recent studies suggested that autophagy has a
pro-survival role in cells subjected to ARSI through AR knock
down, androgen deprivation or by bicalutamide in androgenresponsive cell line LNCaP.6,9,19 Our result is consistent with these
studies but also furthers the ﬁnding in other AR-positive CRPC
cells, including CWR22Rv1 and C4-2B. Furthermore, we report
CRPC cells that conferred ENZA resistance display a higher level of
autophagy than control cells, implicating that autophagy is not
only a survival mechanism but also is associated with chemoresistance. The autophagic cancer cells’ ability to evade apoptosis is
vital to drug resistance, but the mechanism remains speculative
and warrants further investigation.
Regulation of autophagy is complex and often involves
multiple pathways, including the suppression of PI3K/AKT/mTOR
and the activation of AMPK pathways through direct stimulation

of ULK1.20,21 Interaction between AMPK and mTORC1 upon induction of autophagy has been described previously in other cell
types.11,12 Speciﬁcally, active AMPK directly phosphorylates the
TSC2 tumor suppressor, resulting in the inactivation of Rheb and
sequential inhibition of the mTORC1 kinase.13 Alternatively,
activated AMPK can also directly phosphorylate Raptor (one of
the four subunits of the mTORC1 complex) at two conserved sites
Ser722 and Ser792 to suppress the mTORC1 complex.12 Raptor is
responsible for the recruitment of 4EBP1 and the p70 ribosomal S6
kinase (p70S6K1) to the mTORC1 complex.20,21 Boutin et al.9
reported that pAKT is slightly downregulated by 21 ± 18%,
whereas the phosphorylation of p70S6K downstream signal is
much more at 44 ± 23%.10 Previous reports suggested that when
AR axis is suppressed in the setting of Pten loss, prostate cells
resorted to reciprocal negative feedback to activate PI3K or
mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway to adapt and survive
and allow cancer to progress.22,23 However, in our experiments,
we did not see a signiﬁcant change of AKT signaling pathway, but
we saw a much more pronounced downregulation of the mTOR
downstream target, pS6. Neither was there a signiﬁcant change in
mTOR phosphorylation upon autophagy induction by ARSI (data
not shown). We hypothesize that the AKT pathway is not the
predominant regulator of ARSI-induced autophagy, whereas AMPK

activation has a signiﬁcant role. Interfering with AR signaling axis
here only elicits autophagy without PI3K crosstalk as phosphorylation of both AKT and mTOR was unaltered. In the current study,
we demonstrated that AMPK was clearly activated in ARSI-induced
autophagy. siRNA targeting AMPK prevented autophagy induction
when exposed to ARSI. We further showed evidence that AMPK
activation led to phosphorylation of Raptor at Serine 792 in the
mTOR complex resulting in the sequential suppression of its
downstream signaling, indicated by the reduced activation of pS6
in cells with ARSI-mediated autophagy. The mechanistic evidence
in this report suggested that targeting AMPK pathway could be an
important adjunct to prostate cancer therapy as illustrated in
Figure 8. Androgen-deprivation therapy using ARSI including
bicalutamide and ENZA may halt CaP progression even in CRPC
patients. Nonetheless, activation of AMPK mediated by ARSI may
provide the tumor cells a survival mechanism via autophagy that
leads to CRPC progression.

therapy when exposed to combination treatment with autophagy
inhibitor CMI. Autophagy inhibitors, particularly chloroquine and
3-methyladenine, have been shown to sensitize cancer cells to
tamoxifen, cisplatin, ionizing radiation or anti-angiogenic
treatment5,24–28 and have been used in numerous ongoing clinical
trials as adjunctive therapy or primary therapy for breast, lung,
prostate, pancreatic and skin cancer.3 Currently, the only FDAapproved agents that are able to inhibit autophagy are
chloroquine, an antimalarial drug, and its derivative hydroxychloroquine. One completed clinical trial using hydroxychloroquine suggested a survival advantage when added to conventional
treatment for glioblastoma multiforme, but the result was not
statistically signiﬁcant.29 The lack of signiﬁcance could be due to
small sample size or that hydroxychloroquine failed to sufﬁciently
inhibit autophagy in patients. There is a need for pre-clinical
investigation to develop and evaluate new autophagy inhibitors
as a therapeutic strategy in cancer beyond chloroquine. Here, we
reported that CMI, an FDA-approved antidepressant, is effective in
inhibiting autophagy and enhanced therapeutic response in
ENZA-resistant cells in vitro and in vivo using the orthotopic

xenograft model combined with ENZA. Complimentary to this
ﬁnding, we also tested metformin, the FDA-approved anti-diabetic
drug, using the same animal model. Both drugs increased the
efﬁcacy of ENZA for the CRPC cell line. Previous studies have
showed that metformin is a potent autophagy modulator
through AMPK and mTOR signaling.30–32 In addition, metformin
inhibited 2-deoxyglucose-induced autophagy in prostate cancer
cells.33 Treatment with metformin alone or in combination
with mTOR inhibitors have been shown to be effective in
melanoma, lymphoma and breast cancer.31,32,34 This combined
treatment, an equivalent to acute nutrient depletion may
activate the eukaryotic elongation factor 2 kinase (eEF2K) and
block mRNA translation elongation.35 Further exploring of the
AMPK–eEF2K axis in the ARSI-treated cells may be intriguing.
We provided an additional rationale for clinical trials using CMI
and metformin as alternatives to chloroquine in metastatic
prostate cancer. Furthermore, autophagic inhibition could also
have a role in enhancing therapeutic effects on bone metastasis.
Experiments are underway in our labs to study the effects of
autophagy inhibition in delaying or attenuating bone metastasis
in CRPC.
Most cancer therapies induce autophagy as a cytoprotective
stress response and subsequently lead to the attenuation of their
efﬁcacy. The lack of a complete or lasting response of most
monotherapies, including tyrosine kinase inhibitors, allosteric
mTOR inhibitor (Everolimus) or the latest generation antiandrogen, may be explained by the pro-survival function of autophagy.
The critical question is whether the dual roles of autophagy as
pro-survival or pro-death can both be exploited to improve cancer
therapy in advanced CRPC. At the same time, therapies that
induced excessive autophagy to trigger pro-death properties may
not be well tolerated by patients owing to increased dosage
requirement. Here, we provide preclinical data to support that
targeting autophagy could be an attractive option to exploit,
especially with autophagy modulators that has been proven to be
safe. Both CMI and metformin have been in clinical use since 1960,
with established safety records and well tolerated by patients. To
potentially give CRPC patients who progress while on ENZA
therapy a more durable response, combining a well-tolerated and
safe autophagy modulator with ENZA therapy maybe warranted in
a clinical trial.
Oncogene (2014) 4521 – 4530

In summary, our data support autophagy as an adaptive
response to ARSI and an important mechanism of resistance to the
new generation ARSI, ENZA. ARSI-mediated autophagy is dependent on the activation of AMPK pathway and the suppression of
mTOR downstream signaling via phosphorylation of Raptor.
Blocking autophagy pharmacologically or genetically signiﬁcantly
impairs prostate cancer cell survival in vitro and in vivo, implying
the therapeutic potential of autophagy inhibitors in the
antiandrogen-resistance setting.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell lines and reagents
LNCaP, CWR22Rv1 and PC-3 prostate cancer cell line was obtained from
the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA, USA). Cells were
cultured in RPMI supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and
penicillin–streptomycin (100 IU/ml and 100 μg/ml, respectively) or 5%
charcoal-dextran-stripped FBS (CS-FBS) and penicillin/streptomycin in 37 °C
and 5% CO2 atmosphere. LNCaP passage numbers o20 were used
throughout the study. All experiments with cell lines were performed
within 6 months of receipt from ATCC or resuscitation after cryopreservation. C4-2B cells were kindly provided and authenticated by Dr Leland
Chung, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, Los Angeles, CA, USA. The generation
of stably overexpressing eGFP-LC3 fusion gene in LNCaP, CWR22Rv1 and
PC3 cells (LNCaP-eGFP-LC3, CWR22-eGFP-LC3 and PC3-eGFP-LC3, respectively) were described previously.2

Cell cycle analysis
In each experiment, a sample of 10 000 cells was subjected to DNA
staining with propidium iodide to evaluate cell cycle distribution, using
ﬂow cytometry analysis. Brieﬂy, cells were trypsinized, washed and ﬁxed
in phosphate-buffered saline with 1% formaldehyde for 10 min and
subsequently stained with propidium iodide for analysis by a FACScan
system and CellQuest program (Becton Dickinson, San Jose, CA, USA).
LNCaP and C4-2B cells transfected with AMPK siRNA (Ambion, Foster City,
CA, USA) or negative control (scrmbl) were treated with ENZA the next day
and harvested 72 h post transfection for FACScan analysis for sub-G1
content.

Generation of ENZA-resistant CaP cells and RNA deep sequencing
ENZA-resistant LNCaP C4-2B cells were established via culture in media
containing increasing dosage of ENZA up to 40 μM over a 4-month period.

HG Nguyen et al
Cells were then maintained in medium containing 20 μM of ENZA. Total
RNA was extracted from C4-2B ENZA-resistant cells (C4-2B+R) and parental
cells (C4-2B-WT) and then submitted for deep RNA sequencing and
bioinformatics analysis on Illumina HiSeq 2000 (DNA Technologies Core at
the UC Davis Genome Center, using the Illumina sequencing platforms
(HiSeq 2500), Sacramento, CA, USA): 100-bp, paired end sequencing
multiplexed 4 samples/lane. The levels of genes expression are expressed
in FPKM where 3 FPKM = 1 transcript/cell.

Cell extraction, immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting
Cell lysates were collected in radio-immunopreicipitation assay buffer
and subjected to western blotting analysis (40 μg/lane) as described
previously.36,37 For immunoprecipitation, 500 μg of soluble protein was
ﬁrst incubated with primary antibodies for 2 h at room temperature and
further incubated overnight at 4 °C after addition of 25 μl of protein A/GSepharose beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA, USA). The
immunoprecipitated proteins were properly washed and separated by
SDS–PAGE (sodium dodecyl sulfate–polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis)
western blotting analysis. The following antibodies were used in this study:
β-actin (Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO, USA), ATG-5 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), phospho-Src (Tyr416), Src, LC3, phospho-Akt (Ser473), Akt, phosphomTOR (Ser2448), mTOR, phospho-S6 (Ser235/236), S6, phospho-AMPKα
(Thr172), phosphor-Raptor (Serine 792), and AMPKα (Cell Signaling
Technology, Beverly, MA, USA).

Fluorescent microscopy
LNCaP-eGFP-LC3, CWR22Rv1-eGFP-LC3 and PC3-eGFP-LC3 were seeded on
coverslips and treated with 10 μM ENZA for 48 h or 2 μM rapamycin for 4 h as
positive control, followed by 4% paraformaldehyde ﬁxation and mounting
with SlowFade with 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA,
USA). eGFP-LC3 and acridine orange staining for autophagosomes were
examined under a × 40 lens (excitation, 488 nm; emission, 535 nm).

Clonogenic assay
LNCaP and C4-2B cells and C4-2B+R (ENZA resistant) were treated with
DMSO (vehicle control), 5 μM CMI, 10 μM ENZA and a combination of CMI
and ENZA and used clonogenic assay to evaluate the cells' ability to form
colonies as we described elsewhere.36,37 In brief, cells were treated with
1 × trypsin for 5 min in a 37 °C incubator and pipetted several times so that
most cells were in single-cell forms. Five thousand cells were plated on to a
35-mm six-well plate. The covering medium was changed every 2 or 3 days
during culture. After 20 days, cultures were ﬁxed and stained with crystal
violet solution (10% acetic acid, 10% ethanol and 0.06% crystal) and then
visualized using an Olympus IX70 microscope (with × 4 and × 40 objectives). The number of colonies formed was counted for each well,
approximately containing more than three cells to be counted. The
average of counts from three random ﬁelds for each well was taken as the
colony number.

In vivo tumor biology
Animal studies were conducted in accordance with institutional ethical
guidelines for the care and use of experimental animals. In all, 1.5 × 106 C42B+R (ENZA resistant) cells co-suspended with 30% matrigel were injected
orthotopically into male SCID mice. The PSA level was checked every 7
days, and treatment began when PSA ﬁrst become detectable, indication
tumor implantation. Sixteen mice were randomly divided into four groups
and treated with control vehicle, CMI (10 mg/kg/day), metformin (300 mg/
kg/day) and ENZA (25 mg/kg/day) or the combinations of Enza+CMI
and Enza+metformin via esophageal gavaging. At the end of 6 weeks,
mice were killed, and their prostates were collected for weight and
pathological analyses. PSA levels were determined by PSA (human) ELISA
kit (Abnova, Taipei, Taiwan).

Statistical analysis
Data are shown as the mean ± s.d. All were from at least three independent
experiments and subjected to paired t-tests and three-way analysis of
variance. P o0.05 was considered signiﬁcant.
