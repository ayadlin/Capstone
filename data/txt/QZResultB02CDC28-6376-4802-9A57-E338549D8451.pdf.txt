BACKGROUND: Survival benefit of cytoreductive surgery combined with hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemoperfusion was demonstrated by a prospective randomized trial for colorectal peritoneal carcinomatosis. Because of a
recent substantial improvement in chemotherapy, the authors analyzed treatment options of colorectal carcinomatosis in the current era. METHODS: Consecutive patients with colorectal carcinomatosis treated by cytoreductive surgery combined with hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemoperfusion from 2001 to 2007 were included. The control
group patients with carcinomatosis received contemporary chemotherapy alone. Overall survival was the primary
endpoint. RESULTS: All patients underwent systemic chemotherapy. The cytoreductive surgery combined with hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemoperfusion group (n ¼ 67) was similar to the control group (n ¼ 38) in sex, tumor grade,
site of tumor origin, T status, and N status. The control group was, however, older (59 vs 51 years; P<.001). Median
survival measured from the diagnosis of peritoneal disease was longer with cytoreductive surgery combined with
hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemoperfusion (34.7 months vs 16.8 months; P<.001). Presence of liver metastasis was
a significant negative predictor of survival (hazard ratio, 2.13). CONCLUSIONS: The authors concluded that 1) contemporary chemotherapy is associated with prolonged survival among patients with carcinomatosis as compared with
historical controls, and 2) addition of cytoreductive surgery combined with hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemoperfusion to modern chemotherapy regimens may significantly prolong survival. Cytoreductive surgery combined with
hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemoperfusion and systemic chemotherapy are not competitive therapies, and they

Peritoneal carcinomatosis from colorectal cancer has been historically associated with poor survival ranging from 5

to 7 months, and few therapeutic or palliative options.1-4 These patients more than many other cancer patients suffer from
significant and disabling symptoms as a direct result of local tumor progression. As a result, development in this field has
largely focused on innovative surgical approaches in an attempt to control or palliate the locoregional progression in the
absence of systemic extraperitoneal disease. Multiple institutional5-9 and multi-institutional series10,11 have suggested
improved survival with cytoreductive surgery and hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemoperfusion. Nevertheless, these were
cohort studies with no internal controls; comparison was made to historical controls.
To our knowledge, there are only 2 published studies on cytoreductive surgery combined with hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemoperfusion for colorectal carcinomatosis with internal controls: a Dutch prospective randomized trial12
and a French case-control retrospective study.13 In the former, significantly prolonged median survival was observed in
the group receiving cytoreductive surgery combined with hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemoperfusion and systemic
chemotherapy (12.6 vs 22.3 months; P ¼ .032), as compared with the best systemic chemotherapy alone.12,14 Given the

standard of care during the enrollment period, however, a
majority of the patients in this randomized trial received
only 5-fluorouracil as the best systemic chemotherapy
option. A more recent French retrospective multi-institutional study demonstrated median survival of 23.9
months in the standard group versus 62.7 months in the
hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemoperfusion group
(P<.05).13
Although there are several cohort reports on cytoreductive surgery combined with hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemoperfusion for colorectal carcinomatosis from
US institutions,8,9,15 no comparative study with internal
controls has yet been published. In addition, available
data on treatment of peritoneal carcinomatosis did not
result in widespread acceptance, despite endorsement
from field leaders16 and a recent favorable meta-analysis.17 Another prospective randomized trial may put this
issue to rest. Given patient preferences, however, it is
likely that any future trial will fail to accrue, as evidenced
previously.5 Hence, we believe it is important to report
high-volume institutional results until another prospective trial is conducted.
Therefore, we set out to evaluate the contribution of
cytoreductive surgery combined with hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemoperfusion to survival in patients with
carcinomatosis in the modern chemotherapy era. We
compared our experience with cytoreductive surgery combined with hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemoperfusion
for colorectal carcinomatosis against a contemporary
cohort of patients receiving systemic therapy but no cytoreductive surgery combined with hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemoperfusion at our institution.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
We analyzed 105 patients with peritoneal carcinomatosis
of colorectal origin diagnosed between 2001 and 2007.
The primary outcome measure was survival measured
from the diagnosis of peritoneal carcinomatosis. This
study received approval from the University of Pittsburgh
Institutional Review Board. Cytoreductive surgery combined with hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemoperfusion
was performed at 2 closely related institutions by the same
physician team. The unique setup of the University of
Pittsburgh Medical Center Cancer Centers Network connects the main institution with >40 network community
sites covering a geographic area of >200 miles around
greater Pittsburgh. The centralized registry allows analysis
of all patients treated within this large network. Therefore,

we were able to construct a control group with confirmed
carcinomatosis from patients who either refused cytoreductive surgery combined with hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemoperfusion treatment or referral, or were never
referred because of logistic or geographical issues.
Patient Selection and Data Collection
Sixty-seven consecutive patients underwent cytoreductive
surgery combined with hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemoperfusion procedure and systemic chemotherapy for
metastatic colorectal cancer. The control group was
selected by a review of the institutional multihospital cancer registry and consisted of 38 patients. Control group
inclusion criteria were 1) asymptomatic peritoneal carcinomatosis of colorectal origin; 2) aggressive systemic
chemotherapy; and 3) primary tumor removed, but did
not undergo cytoreductive surgery with hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemoperfusion. Control group exclusion
criteria included 1) poor performance status, 2) intent for
supportive care only, and 3) unresectable carcinomatosis
volume as judged by computed tomography (CT) scan
review. The diagnosis of peritoneal carcinomatosis in the
control group was verified by a surgical procedure or by
the development of obvious evidence of carcinomatosis
on CT scan. Presence of limited liver involvement (superficial lesions only) was allowed in both groups. Demographics, tumor characteristics (grade, TNM stage, and
site of original tumor), chemotherapy treatment, and survival outcome were analyzed.
Surgical Approach
Our standard operative approach is described in detail
elsewhere.7 Briefly, a midline laparotomy was followed by
complete adhesiolysis, omentectomy, and selective peritonectomy in all patients. Cytoreductive surgery with resection of tumor masses and/or organs then followed, with
the objective of rendering patients with no visible disease.
Hyperthermic chemoperfusion was achieved using a
closed abdomen perfusion technique with 3 L of perfusate
containing 30 mg mitomycin C for the first hour followed
by an additional 10 mg for 40 more minutes using a
roller-pump heat exchanger perfusion machine (ThermoChem HT-1000, ThermaSolutions, Melbourne, Fla).
This was followed by a reconstruction phase and laparotomy closure.
Statistical Analysis
To examine baseline differences in the data, a t test and
chi-square tests were performed. The 2-sample Student t

3757

Original Article

test was used to determine whether there was a significant
relationship between age and group (control vs cytoreductive surgery combined with hyperthermic intraperitoneal
chemoperfusion). Chi-square tests were used to determine
whether there were any significant relationships between
group and the following categorical variables: sex, tumor
grade (grade I/II vs grade III), site of origin (colon vs rectum), liver lesion (absent vs present), and prior treatment
with oxaliplatin, irinotecan, and biological agents.
Survival was measured from the date of diagnosis of
peritoneal disease to the date of last follow-up or death
and was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Logrank tests were performed to examine the univariate associations between survival and clinical variables. Cox proportional hazard models were built using all variables with
P <.2 in univariate testing. Other variables that were felt
to be important10,18 predictors of survival were also investigated, such as chemotherapy agents, tumor grade, and
metastatic versus nonmetastatic status at presentation.
Because tumor grade violated the proportional hazard
assumption, both grade-stratified and unstratified models
without tumor grade were created. Statistical significance
was assumed at .05.

RESULTS
There was no statistical difference between the groups in
distribution of sex, tumor grade, site of origin (colon vs
rectum), and T and N classification of the original tumor.
However, the control group was older (mean 59 years in
the control group vs mean 51 years in the hyperthermic
intraperitoneal chemoperfusion group; P<.001), had a
higher proportion of patients who were diagnosed with
carcinomatosis at their initial presentation (76% vs 42%;
P<.001), and had a higher proportion of patients with
liver lesion (35% vs 15%; P ¼ .014).
All patients received systemic chemotherapy. There
were no differences between the 2 groups in administration of 5-fluorouracil and irinotecan, but the control
group was less likely to receive oxaliplatin (47% vs 78%;
P ¼ .001) and biological agents (bevacizumab and/or
cetuximab, 18% vs 59%; P<.0001). Six patients in the
cytoreductive surgery combined with hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemoperfusion group received a suboptimal
debulking (R2), but remained included in the study.
Median survival measured from the diagnosis of
peritoneal disease was longer with cytoreductive surgery
combined with hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemoperfusion (34.7 months vs 16.8 months; P<.001; Fig. 1).

control group are shown. Chemo indicates chemotherapy.

Besides cytoreductive surgery combined with hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemoperfusion, only chemotherapy
with biological agents and absence of liver metastasis were
associated with survival advantage in the univariate testing
(Table 1). Sex, tumor grade, site of primary tumor origin
(colonic vs rectal), and presence of carcinomatosis at initial cancer diagnosis (stage I-III vs stage IV/carcinomatosis) were not associated with survival.
Multivariate Cox proportional hazards modeling
was performed on all patients with available data. Tumor
grade was the only variable that violated the proportional
hazard assumption. On detailed analysis, there is some
evidence that tumor grade affects survival, particularly at
early times. Conversely, tumor grade is not a confounder,
because it is not associated with cytoreductive surgery
combined with hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemoperfusion treatment.
Therefore, 3 Cox proportional hazard regression
models were developed, where the latter 2 represent sensitivity analysis and point to the robustness of the results.
There were 91 cases available for the first model, which
included significant predictor variables from univariate
testing (Table 2). Tumor grade lacked the predefined
entry P value and consequently was not included in this
model. Delivery of cytoreductive surgery combined with
hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemoperfusion was a
significant predictor of survival after adjusting for all other
variables. Presence of liver metastasis was a negative
significant predictor of survival, and its effect size was
comparable to that of cytoreductive surgery combined
with hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemoperfusion.

a
Factors found to be associated with survival were CS-HIPEC, the presence of a liver lesion, and systemic chemotherapy with a biologic agent.

Carcinomatosis from rectal primary tumors portends a
substantially worse prognosis than that from a colon primary tumor. Age and the presence of carcinomatosis at
initial presentation of cancer were not predictive of survival. Moreover, chemotherapy with oxaliplatin or a biological agent was also not a predictor of survival.
We attempted to include tumor grade as a variable
in the analysis. Because tumor grade did not follow the
proportional hazard assumption, the second model was
stratified on tumor grade. There were 75 cases with data
available for this analysis: 51 patients in stratum 1 (grade
I-II) and 24 patients in stratum 2 (grade III, Fig. 2). Each
group has a distinct baseline hazard function, but common values for the coefficients.19 The relative effect of
each predictor is assumed the same across strata. The pres-

Cancer

ence of liver lesion(s) was the only significant predictor of
survival in the model (Table 3).
To further investigate the effect of missing values for
tumor grade, we developed a third model. This model
included 91 cases, and contained all variables from the
first model plus a dummy variable for whether grade was
reported. There was no substantial change of covariate values, and the regression coefficient for the dummy variable
was not statistically significant (data not shown).

DISCUSSION
Great progress in treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer
has been noted since the turn of the millennium, with median survival exceeding 20 months. Nevertheless, cure
with chemotherapy remains rare, and prospectively
observed 5-year survival in participants of trials is 1.1%.20
Colorectal carcinomatosis has been associated with particularly poor prognosis, with median survival traditionally
reported to be around 6 months.1-4
Cytoreductive surgery and intraperitoneal chemotherapy have been successfully used in ovarian cancer and
are increasing reported in colorectal carcinomatosis.
Many authors have reported encouraging survival of
patients with peritoneal carcinomatosis from colorectal
cancer treated with cytoreductive surgery combined with
hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemoperfusion.7-11,21,22
However, these studies compared cytoreductive surgery
combined with hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemoperfusion to historical controls, and some were performed
before the widespread availability of modern chemotherapy regimens. Similarly, in the only randomized trial
demonstrating an advantage to cytoreductive surgery
combined with hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemoperfusion, 5-fluorouracil alone was the dominant chemotherapy regimen. Introduction of irinotecan, oxaliplatin, and
bevacizumab has been well documented to lead to
improvement of median survival among those with previously untreated metastatic colorectal cancer and good performance status.23,24 It remains undefined whether these
improvements can be extrapolated to patients with peritoneal carcinomatosis. Nonetheless, it is reasonable to
assume a positive effect of present-day chemotherapy on
peritoneal carcinomatosis. Indeed, in this contemporary
series we observed a median survival of 16.8 months
among those in the control group, with peritoneal carcinomatosis from colorectal cancer treated by best systemic
chemotherapy alone. This represents a substantial
improvement as compared with traditionally cited

historical controls.1-4,12 Longer median survival of 23.9
months has been recently reported among French patients
with asymptomatic colorectal carcinomatosis treated with
modern chemotherapy alone.13 Our data support that 1)
contemporary chemotherapy is associated with prolonged
survival among patients with carcinomatosis as compared
with historical controls, and 2) addition of cytoreductive
surgery combined with hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemoperfusion to modern chemotherapy regimens significantly prolongs survival in selected patients.
Beyond the Dutch prospective randomized trial and
the current report, there is only 1 additional study of
cytoreductive surgery combined with hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemoperfusion in colorectal carcinomatosis
with internal controls. Elias et al examined patients with
asymptomatic colorectal carcinomatosis treated by modern chemotherapy versus those treated by cytoreductive
surgery combined with hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemoperfusion.13 The cytoreductive surgery combined with
hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemoperfusion cohort
received oxaliplatin 460 mg/m2 30-minute hyperthermic
intraperitoneal chemoperfusion after cytoreduction and
survived significantly longer (62.7 vs 23.9 months;
P<.05). Our protocol uses traditional mitomycin C (40
mg total dose over 100-minute perfusion) and resulted in
comparatively shorter survival of 34.7 months. Although
these 2 studies cannot be directly compared, oxaliplatin
may be superior to traditional mitomycin C for intraperitoneal application. Nevertheless, both the French13 and

3760

our study support superiority of cytoreductive surgery
combined with hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemoperfusion therapy for a select population of patients with
peritoneal colorectal carcinomatosis as previously demonstrated by the randomized trial.12,14 In the context of survival analysis, it is necessary to point out major
methodological differences in calculating survival times;
comparative retrospective studies, such as the study of
Elias et al13 and the present study, calculate survival from
the diagnosis of peritoneal carcinomatosis. In contrast,
single-arm observational studies8,10 calculate survival
from the cytoreductive surgery combined with hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemoperfusion procedure, whereas
the randomized trial measured survival since
randomization.12,14
We recognize several inherent limitations to this
type of study and have attempted to limit bias in the analysis. First, we excluded patients with poor performance
status and supportive care only. We required presence of
initially asymptomatic carcinomatosis and at least 4 cycles
of chemotherapy for inclusion in the control arm. Because
performance status affects survival, this approach limits
selection bias toward poor-performance patients entering
the control group. Second, to avoid lead-in bias, we
elected to report survival measured from diagnosis of peritoneal carcinomatosis for the purpose of comparison
between the groups. Because selection of control group in
retrospective studies always has to be presumed as biased,
we took special precautions to limit the selection bias.
This resulted in a relatively limited number of control
cases. Similarly, Elias et al13 collected a limited number of

their control cases among 5 large cancer centers. The
unique setup of our institution (a network of cancer centers) permits for analysis of data from many cancer centers
and allowed us to construct our control group in a similar
fashion to that of Elias et al.13
We investigated the prognostic value of certain predictors. The prognostic usefulness of tumor grade in colorectal carcinomatosis is poorly elucidated, and remains
controversial. In agreement with others,18 the survival difference by tumor grade was not significant in this study.
On the contrary, worsening prognosis was associated with
a higher tumor grade in pooled analysis.10 Baseline hazard
functions for tumor grade were not proportional in this
cohort. Therefore, the effect of tumor grade on survival
was difficult to evaluate in multivariate models. Hopefully, future studies will explain the interaction of tumor
grade, other clinical variables, and role of cytoreductive
surgery combined with hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemoperfusion in the treatment of peritoneal carcinomatosis from colorectal cancer. It is also interesting that rectal
origin of carcinomatosis had a highly negative impact on
survival in 1 of our multivariate models. Although Verwaal et al observed 5.6 months shorter median survival
among patients with a rectal primary tumor, their observation did not reach statistical significance.12 Similarly,
others reported no survival difference between rectal and
colonic origin of peritoneal carcinomatosis.10 Lastly, we
chose to allow the presence of concurrent liver metastases
in both of our cohorts. Negative prognostic effect of liver
lesion has been observed in this study and by others,10,11
but contrary reports are equally available.4,25

A multidisciplinary approach to metastatic colorectal cancer is rapidly evolving. Surgical treatment of hepatic26,27 and/or pulmonary28 metastases is considered
appropriate in selected patients. It remains interesting
that although no prospective randomized trial has ever
been conducted to evaluate the efficacy of liver resection
for colorectal liver metastases, this therapy is recognized
worldwide as a standard of care for colorectal liver metastases. Direct retrospective comparison of cytoreductive
surgery combined with hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemoperfusion and liver resection for colorectal liver metastases suggests that both bring a similar magnitude of
survival benefit29,30 to selected patients with stage IV
disease.
Cytoreductive surgery combined with hyperthermic
intraperitoneal chemoperfusion may be associated with
survival benefit in selected patients with peritoneal carcinomatosis from colorectal cancer. This benefit appears to
be preserved even among patients with modern chemotherapy. It is important to note that cytoreductive surgery
combined with hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemoperfusion and systemic chemotherapy are not competitive
therapies, but rather complementary techniques. This
analysis supports that cytoreductive surgery combined
with hyperthermic intraperitoneal perfusion has a role in
the multidisciplinary approach to patients suffering from
colorectal carcinomatosis.
