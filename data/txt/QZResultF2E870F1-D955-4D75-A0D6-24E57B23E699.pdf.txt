BACKGROUND: Randomized trials have shown that androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT) improves survival for men with
intermediate-risk prostate cancer treated with radiotherapy (RT). The benefit of ADT to patients with favorable intermediate-risk
prostate cancer treated with modern dose-escalated RT is unknown. This study evaluated the effectiveness of ADT on survival of men
with favorable intermediate-risk prostate cancer treated with dose-escalated RT. METHODS: This study was a retrospective cohort
analysis of men with favorable intermediate-risk prostate cancer from 2004 to 2007 in the National Cancer Data Base. Favorable
intermediate-risk disease was defined as 1 adverse risk factor (prostate-specific antigen level of 10-20 ng/mL or Gleason score of 7)
and clinical T1/T2 prostate cancer. All patients were treated with primary dose-escalated RT (75.6 Gy or RT with a brachytherapy
boost). Overall survival was analyzed with propensity score adjustment and Cox multivariate modeling. RESULTS: The study included
18,598 patients. The use of ADT decreased from 43.5% in 2004 to 39.5% in 2007. The propensity score–adjusted survival analysis
demonstrated similar 8-year overall survival for men treated with dose-escalated RT and ADT and men treated with RT alone (77.7%
vs 78.4%). ADT was not associated with improved survival in any age or comorbidity subgroup. In a sensitivity analysis using Cox multivariate modeling, the receipt of ADT was not associated with overall survival (hazard ratio, 0.99; 95% confidence interval, 0.91-1.07;
P 5 .768). CONCLUSIONS: Adding ADT to modern dose-escalated RT was not associated with improved survival for patients with
favorable intermediate-risk prostate cancer. The applicability of the survival benefit seen in older trials to modern patients is unclear.
Because of the morbidity associated with ADT, dose-escalated RT alone for patients with favorable intermediate-risk prostate cancer

INTRODUCTION
Randomized trials conducted in the 1980s and 1990s demonstrated that the addition of androgen-deprivation therapy
(ADT) to radiotherapy (RT) improves overall survival for patients with aggressive prostate cancer.1-3 Most of the published trials involved patients with high-risk or locally advanced disease,1-3 and these results firmly established the combination of RT with ADT as a standard of care for these patients.4 On the other hand, the role of concurrent ADT with RT
for patients with intermediate-risk prostate cancer is controversial. Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) 94-08
was a randomized trial that included 1979 patients with early prostate cancer; patients were treated either with RT to 66.6
Gy or with RT with 4 months of ADT. Among the intermediate-risk patients, the 10-year overall survival rate was 54%
with RT and 61% with RT and ADT.5 Whether this modest absolute survival benefit applies to modern intermediate-risk
patients is unclear. First, standard radiation doses are now much higher (75.6 Gy or higher) than those used in the RTOG
trial (66.6 Gy), and this likely mitigates some of the observed benefit from ADT. Furthermore, intermediate risk encompasses a wide range of patients with different degrees of disease aggressiveness and prognoses; it is now commonly accepted
that a subset of patients with favorable intermediate-risk disease according to clinical characteristics have more favorable
outcomes than the patients studied overall in the randomized trials.6 It is controversial whether these favorable
intermediate-risk patients benefit from the addition of ADT to modern dose-escalated RT; this debate is further fueled by
the increasing awareness of potential long-term morbidity associated with ADT.7

ADT had to have been initiated before or on the first date of radiotherapy
to be considered concurrent. This criterion was applied only to patients
who received ADT.

Demonstrating the current clinical uncertainty, the
National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN)
guidelines recommend dose-escalated external-beam RT
with or without short-term ADT (for 4-6 months) as
treatment options for intermediate-risk prostate cancer.4
To provide evidence to inform this debate, the goal of this
current study was to examine whether the addition of
ADT to modern dose-escalated RT improves overall survival for patients with favorable intermediate-risk prostate
cancer. We used data from the National Cancer Data
Base (NCDB), a large nationwide cancer registry that
includes approximately 70% of cancer patients from
across the United States.8
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Data Source

The NCDB is jointly maintained by the American
College of Surgeons and the American Cancer Society8
and collects data from approximately 1500 Commission
on Cancer–accredited cancer centers across the United
States. It is by far the largest cancer registry in the United
States. Data elements include the following: patient-level
demographic information (age, race, and insurance status), regional-level (US postal zip code) education
and household income, cancer disease characteristics
(prostate-specific antigen [PSA] level, Gleason score, and
clinical stage), Charlson/Deyo comorbidity score, and
treatment details (including dates, radiation doses, and
2342

the use of ADT). Regional-level data were derived from
the year 2000 US census. This study was exempted by the
Institutional Review Board.
Patient Cohort

Men diagnosed with prostate cancer (and no other prior
cancer) between 2004 and 2007 were included to allow at
least 5 years of potential follow-up time for all patients so
that overall survival could be evaluated. Before 2004, the
NCDB did not contain sufficient information to ascertain
the prostate cancer risk category. Men with distant or
nodal metastases at diagnosis and those with locally
advanced disease (clinical stage T3 or T4) were excluded.
Intermediate-risk prostate cancer was defined on the basis
of the PSA level, biopsy Gleason score, and clinical T stage
with the NCCN guideline definition.4 Favorable
intermediate-risk patients were defined as patients with
only 1 adverse risk factor (PSA level of 10-20 ng/mL or
Gleason score of 7). This was similar to previously published definitions.6,9,10 Included patients were all treated
with dose-escalated RT, which was defined as externalbeam RT to a dose of 75.6 Gy per NCCN guidelines,4 or
a combination of external-beam RT with a brachytherapy
boost. No patients underwent prostatectomy before RT.
ADT had to have been initiated before or on the first date
of RT treatment to be considered concurrent. An inclusion schema is shown in Table 1. The final analytic cohort
consisted of 18,598 patients.
Statistical Analysis

The change over time in the proportion of patients who
received ADT was reported, and statistical significance
was evaluated with the Cochran-Armitage test for trend.
Baseline patient characteristics were summarized by
treatment modality (RT or RT with ADT). Overall survival was evaluated with Kaplan-Meier analysis, and unadjusted hazard ratios were reported. Propensity scores were
computed with logistic regression models to account for
potentially clinically relevant factors such as patient age,
race, regional income and education, insurance status,
year of diagnosis, type of treatment facility, geographic
region, comorbidity (Charlson/Deyo score), PSA group
(10 vs 10.1-20 ng/mL), clinical T stage, and Gleason
score. The propensity score model also included interaction terms for age with comorbidity, PSA, T stage, and
Gleason score because age is a strong determinant of not
only treatment but also the survival outcome.
Our primary analysis was a propensity score weight–
adjusted overall survival comparison of patients who
received RT alone and patients who received RT with

comorbidity score to discern whether an overall survival
benefit could be seen in different patient groups.
For a sensitivity analysis, we constructed multivariate Cox proportional hazards models to examine whether
the addition of ADT was significantly associated with
overall survival. Hazard ratio estimates were adjusted for
the same potentially relevant factors used in the computation of propensity scores. For all the statistical analyses, 2sided P values were calculated, with a level < .05 considered statistically significant. All statistical analyses were
performed with SAS 9.4 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC).
RESULTS
Unadjusted and propensity score–adjusted patient cohort
characteristics are summarized in Table 2. Before the propensity score adjustment, differences were observed
between the 2 comparison groups in insurance status,
treatment facilities, geographic regions, and Gleason
scores. After the adjustment, these differences were eliminated. In the adjusted model, the median follow-up for
patients treated with RT alone was 75.0 months (interquartile range, 63.7-89.3 months), and for patients
treated with RT and ADT, the median follow-up was
75.6 months (interquartile range, 63.6-89.0 months).
The concurrent use of ADT with RT across the
United States decreased over time (P < .001). In 2004,
43.5% of patients received ADT concurrently with doseescalated RT. This decreased to 43.4% in 2005, 42.6% in
2006, and 39.5% in 2007.
In the unadjusted patient cohort, the receipt of
ADT with RT was associated with a higher risk of death
(hazard ratio, 1.09; 95% CI, 1.01-1.17; P 5 .029).
2344

Propensity score–adjusted overall survival results for
the entire cohort are shown in Figure 1, with survival
curves superimposable for RT and RT/ADT patient
groups. The 5-year overall survival rate was 89.6% (95%
CI, 89.0%-90.3%) for RT alone and 90.1% (95% CI,
89.4%-90.8%) for RT with ADT; the 8-year results were
78.4% for RT (95% CI, 77.2%-79.6%) and 77.7% for
RT with ADT (95% CI, 76.3%-79.2%). Adjusted survival
curves for patient subgroups by age and comorbidity are
shown in Figures 2 and 3. In no subgroup was there a significant difference in overall survival between patients
treated with RT alone and patients treated with RT and
ADT. That is, overall and stratified inverse probability–
weighted Cox regression analyses did not show any significant difference in survival between patients who received
RT alone and those who received RT with ADT (Table 3).
A Cox proportional hazards model revealed a consistent result (Table 4). There was no significant association between receiving ADT and overall survival (hazard
ratio, 0.99; 95% CI, 0.91-1.07; P 5 .768). On the other
hand, a higher comorbidity score, age, and stage were all
associated with increased mortality. For a sensitivity analysis, an additional Cox multivariate model was constructed, to which “brachytherapy boost” was added as a
covariate; this did not change the finding that ADT was
not associated with improved survival (hazard ratio for
ADT vs no ADT, 0.98; P 5 .596).
DISCUSSION
This study of 18,598 patients from a large nationwide
cancer registry demonstrated no overall survival benefit
from the addition of ADT to dose-escalated RT among
modern patients with favorable intermediate-risk prostate
cancer. This study directly addresses a current area of controversy to inform clinical decisions, and it provides evidence from the largest study to date.
Whether modern patients receiving dose-escalated
RT benefit from concurrent ADT is unknown. This is
reflected in published guidelines,4 which recommend either dose-escalated RT alone or dose-escalated RT with
concurrent short-term ADT for intermediate-risk prostate
cancer. Furthermore, a currently enrolling randomized
trial (RTOG 0815) is directly comparing dose-escalated
RT and ADT with dose-escalated RT without ADT
(NCT00936390), and this signifies equipoise and the importance of this clinical question. However, overall survival results from this trial may not be available to inform
clinical decision making for another decade. In the meantime, data are needed to inform clinical decisions, but

almost no published studies have directly examined the
question asked by the current study.
The debate about ADT centers around several
issues. First, prior randomized trials using lower dose RT
demonstrated relatively modest survival benefits from
concurrent ADT.1,5 Modern dose-escalated RT is likely
to make this overall survival benefit even smaller or possibly completely eliminate the benefit from ADT. Second,
Cancer

the harms of ADT have been increasingly described over
the past few years and include cardiovascular morbidity,
fatigue, sexual dysfunction, and bone loss12; with this
increasing awareness of the potential tradeoffs of ADT,
any potential survival benefit has to be balanced against
these morbidities. Three, there is an increasing acknowledgment of the heterogeneity of intermediate-risk prostate cancer; with favorable intermediate-risk behaving

more like low-risk disease and therefore identifying a
group of patients least likely to derive benefit from adding
ADT to dose-escalated RT. Indeed, our finding that less
than half of these patients received ADT (with ADT use
decreasing over time) demonstrates the manifestation of
these considerations in clinical practice across the United
States.
A prior randomized trial suggested that the overall
survival benefit conferred by ADT (added to conventional/lower doses of RT) in intermediate-risk patients
may be seen primarily in those with minimal comorbidity; patients with moderate to severe comorbidities
may not derive a survival benefit from the addition of
ADT to RT.1 A recent long-term update of this study
no longer found a significant overall survival benefit
from ADT.13 The current study evaluated this question
directly by stratifying patients according to their
2346

Charlson/Deyo comorbidity scores in a subgroup analysis. Importantly, our results showed that among
patients with favorable intermediate-risk prostate cancer, even those patients who had minimal comorbidity
did not appear to benefit from the addition of ADT to
dose-escalated RT. However, it is notable that the
Charlson-Deyo score does not specifically capture functional status, cardiac risk factors, or life expectancy,
which are important considerations in this patient population. Our study extends findings from the prior
clinical trial and fills a current knowledge gap: even in
healthy patients, avoiding ADT for favorable
intermediate-risk disease treated with modern doseescalated RT could be a reasonable option. This option
may be further strengthened when one weighs the morbidities that are associated with ADT10 against a lack
of a significant benefit in this patient population.
Our search of the literature found several studies
examining the potential benefit of ADT in the setting
of dose-escalated RT specifically for patients with favorable intermediate-risk prostate cancer. In the singleinstitution study by Bian et al,14 302 patients with
favorable intermediate-risk prostate cancer were retrospectively analyzed, and no improvement was seen in
failure-free survival. These results are consistent with
those from our study, but the prior study was smaller
and had a less representative patient population, and
overall survival was not examined. Additional retrospective studies have similarly demonstrated that the addition of ADT to dose-escalated RT does not improve
prostate cancer outcomes.15,16
There are multiple strengths and limitations of our
study. One limitation is the retrospective design and
potential for confounding. We tried to minimize this by
performing propensity score–weighted analyses and also
constructing Cox multivariate models for a sensitivity
analysis. For example, we included the year of diagnosis in
multivariate models to account for changes in treatment
techniques over time and differences in follow-up for the
patient cohorts. The consistency of our findings through
multiple analytic methodologies strengthens the validity
of our conclusion that ADT does not improve survival for
patients with favorable intermediate-risk prostate cancer
in the setting of modern dose-escalated RT. On the other
hand, no randomized trial data are currently available to
inform this specific (clinically relevant and controversial)
question. It is possible that with longer follow-up, a difference in survival might be observed between patients who
receive ADT and patients who do not receive ADT,

although in the current study, there was no evidence of a
survival difference even in later years of follow-up.
A limitation of the NCDB is the lack of some specific data elements that would have been useful to this
study. This includes a lack of information on recurrence
and cancer-specific survival, which are clinically relevant
endpoints. However, it should be noted that assessing biochemical recurrence in a setting of ADT (for 1 of the 2
comparison arms) is difficult because of the direct effect
of testosterone suppression on PSA measures, which can
linger for years after the cessation of ADT.17 The NCDB
does not contain information pertaining to toxicity from
treatment, which is not considered in the current analysis.
We feel that an overall survival comparison, which was
performed in this study, is perhaps the most informative
for patients and their physicians. Another data element
that would have been useful is the percentage of biopsy
cores containing cancer; this is prognostic for disease-free
survival.18 However, we are not aware of any large
population-based data set that contains this information
for patients treated during the years of this study. The
NCDB also lacks information regarding the type of ADT
used and the duration of ADT. The duration of ADT is
an important consideration when one is evaluating
the risks and benefits of adding ADT to RT. Several
randomized trials have compared short-term ADT with

long-term ADT with RT for prostate cancer.19-21 However, these trials included a mixture of patients with locally
advanced, high-risk, and intermediate-risk disease, so it is
unclear whether the benefit of long-term ADT over shortterm ADT applies to the subset of patients with favorable
intermediate-risk prostate cancer treated with modern
dose-escalated RT.
An important strength of this study is the large sample size of NCDB patients. The NCDB includes approximately 70% of incident cancers in the United States, with
the majority of patients treated in the community. Thus,
the current study informs patients and physicians about
the effectiveness of ADT for favorable intermediate-risk
patients, whereas future reporting of clinical trial data will
show the efficacy of ADT in select patients treated in controlled settings. Another strength related to large sample
size was the ability to perform subgroup analyses by age
and comorbidity score; this more comprehensively
addresses the question of the potential benefit of ADT in
clinically relevant patient populations. Subgroup comparisons can be more difficult in clinical trials because of the
limited sample size and power of subgroups.
In conclusion, using a broad United States–based
cohort, this study showed that among patients with favorable intermediate-risk prostate cancer, the addition of
ADT to modern dose-escalated RT was not associated

relevant and directly informs a current area of significant
controversy. Until results from randomized trials are
available, this study represents the largest to date for
informing patients and physicians on the effectiveness of
ADT in this patient population.
