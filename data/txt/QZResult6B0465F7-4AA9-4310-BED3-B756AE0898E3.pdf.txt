BACKGROUND: Several studies have demonstrated that abnormal levels of nuclear matrix protein 22 (NMP22) are
associated with bladder cancer and have led to the approval of NMP22 as a urinary biomarker by the US Food and
Drug Administration. Nonetheless, the clinical significance of NMP22 remains unclear. The objective of this study was
to use decision analysis to determine whether NMP22 improves medical decision-making. METHODS: The current
study included 2222 patients who had a history of nonmuscle-invasive bladder cancer and current negative cytology.
The authors developed models to predict cancer recurrence or progression to muscle-invasive disease using voided
NMP22 levels, cystoscopy, age, and sex. Clinical net benefit was calculated by summing the benefits (true-positives),
subtracting the harms (false-positives), and weighting these values by the threshold probability at which a patient or
clinician would opt for cytoscopy. RESULTS: After cystoscopy, 581 patients (26%) had cancer identified. The NMP22
level was associated significantly with bladder cancer recurrence and progression (P < .001 for both). The use of
NMP22 in a model with age and sex was associated with better patient outcomes than performing cystoscopy on
everyone and produced threshold probabilities > 8% for recurrence and > 3% for progression. Only offering cystoscopy to those who had a risk > 15% reduced the number of cystoscopies by 229 while missing only 25 cancer recurrences per 1000 men with negative cytology. The current study was limited by its multicenter design.
CONCLUSIONS: For clinicians who would perform a cystoscopy at a threshold of 5% for recurrence or 1% for progression, NMP22 did not aid clinical decision-making. For less risk-averse clinicians who would only perform a cystoscopy
at a threshold probability >thinsp;8% for recurrence or > 3% for progression, NMP22 helped to indicate

Bladder cancer represents an important cause of morbidity and mortality. In 2010, once again, it is the second most

common genitourinary cancer in the United States, with a projected 70,530 new cases and 14,680 deaths.1 Currently, it is
estimated that there are > 500,000 men and women alive in the United States who have a history of bladder cancer. At the
time of initial diagnosis, approximately 70% of patients have cancers confined to the epithelium or the subepithelial connective tissue. These cancers usually are managed with endoscopic resection and the selective use of intravesical therapy.
The recurrence rate for these tumors ranges from 50% to 70%, and between 10% and 15% progress to muscle-invasive

disease over 5 years.2,3 Disease recurrence may occur
locally or in the upper urinary tract even after several
years, necessitating life-long surveillance.
The expense of cystoscopy and inadequate sensitivity of cytology have led to a search for noninvasive urinary
markers. An ideal bladder tumor marker would allow
accurate monitoring of patients with a history of bladder
cancer, early identification of recurrence, and prevention
of disease progression. An accurate marker also would
have the potential to replace, delay, or complement cystoscopy and/or cytology in the monitoring of patients
with bladder cancer. An ideal bladder cancer monitoring
test would be noninvasive, objective, and easy to perform
and interpret with high sensitivity and specificity, and it
would provide an immediate or rapid result. Although
most of the urine-based tests remain investigational, a few
have been approved for clinical use based on clinical trials.
Thus, as of January 2010, 6 tests, including 1 for nuclear
matrix protein 22 (NMP22), have been approved by the
US Food and Drug Administration for the monitoring of
patients with nonmuscle-invasive bladder cancer. However, there is significant heterogeneity in performance
characteristics of NMP22 that may affect its predictive accuracy when evaluating cancer recurrence and progression
in different populations.4 For a molecular marker to be
clinically useful, first, it needs to provide information that
is more useful than clinical variables alone. We have demonstrated that urinary levels of NMP22 improved the
ability of a nomogram that included urine cytology, age,
and sex to predict urothelial carcinoma of the bladder recurrence and progression by a statistically and clinically
significant margin.5 However, it is unclear whether this
increase in accuracy and risk assessment translates into
improved patient outcomes. Indeed, an improvement in
predictive accuracy, although necessary, is not sufficient
to assess whether using the marker in practice actually
would benefit patients. The substantial human and financial resources necessary for randomized trials make such
an evaluation impractical for most biomarkers. Decisionanalytic techniques often can be used instead of trials. The
key point of decision analysis is that the consequences of
clinical decisions, such as an increased number of
unnecessary cystoscopies, are incorporated into the analyses. Decision analysis allows investigators to weight the
relative value of the benefits (true-positives) to the harms
(false-positives) and, thus, incorporate the consequences
of a clinical decision.6,7 The objective of the current study
was to use decision analysis to determine whether
NMP22 improves medical decision-making for patients

on surveillance for nonmuscle-invasive urothelial carcinoma of the urinary bladder.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients
All studies were performed after approval was obtained
from a local human investigations committee and in accordance with an assurance filed with and approved by
the Department of Health and Human Services, as appropriate. Informed consent was obtained from each patient.
This study included 2739 patients who presented with
histologically confirmed bladder urothelial carcinoma
without evidence of muscle invasion (stages Ta, T1, and/
or carcinoma in situ).5 Because a positive urinary cytology
result almost always would be followed by cytoscopy, we
restricted our cohort to the 2222 patients who had negative cytology results.
All patients underwent office cystoscopy and urinary
cytology evaluation and had voided urine levels of
NMP22 measured. Patients were included in the study at
various stages of surveillance. Patients who had suspicious
cystoscopy findings were evaluated with transurethral
biopsies and/or resection of suspicious lesion(s). All histology slides were reviewed by a genitourinary pathologist
who was blinded to patients’ clinical data. The 1997
TNM classification and the 1998 World Health Organization grading systems were used. Urinary NMP22 levels
were quantified according to the recommendations of the
test manufacturer (Matritech Inc., Newton, Mass).
Statistical Methods
We created 2 logistic regression models to predict bladder
cancer recurrence. The first model included only patient’s
age and sex, and the second model also included the
NMP22 level. A separate logistic regression model was
created to predict progression to invasive disease, which
we defined as T1 or greater, using NMP22, age, and sex
(age and sex alone were not predictive of disease progression). In all models, NMP22 was entered as a continuous
variable with restricted cubic splines at the tertiles to allow
for a nonlinear relation with risk.
We used decision curve analysis to determine
whether incorporating NMP22 levels into the statistical
model improved patient outcomes. Decision-curve analysis is a method for evaluating the clinical net benefit of
prediction models in which the benefits (true-positives)
are added and the harms (false-positives) are subtracted.
The weights assigned to true-positives and false-positives

are derived from the threshold probability of the outcome.
In the current study, we defined the threshold probability
as the minimum probability of bladder cancer recurrence
or progression at which a patient (or clinician) would opt
for cytoscopy. For example, if a patient would opt for
cytoscopy with a 10% risk of bladder cancer relapse but
would forgo the cytoscopy with only a 9% risk, then the
threshold probability was 10%. Because the threshold
probabilities can vary from patient to patient, the net benefit is calculated across a range of probabilities. For the
outcome of bladder cancer relapse, we chose 5% to 20%
as the range of plausible threshold probabilities; for the
outcome of bladder cancer progression, the range of
threshold probabilities chosen was lower (1%-10%). All
analyses were conducted using the Stata software package
(version 10; StataCorp, College Station, Tex).

RESULTS
Table 1 lists the characteristics of the 2222 patients who
underwent cystoscopy after a negative cytology result. Of
these patients, 581 patients (26%) had disease recurrence;
and, among these, 234 patients (40%) experienced disease
progression (T1 and higher). Patients who experienced
disease recurrence tended to be older (median age, 70
years vs 66 years) and had higher NMP22 levels (median,
8.5 ng/mL vs 3.8 ng/mL) than the patients who did not
experience disease recurrence.
On multivariate analysis, the NMP22 level was associated significantly with disease recurrence and progression (P < .001 for both) (Table 2). Figure 1 provides a

for age and sex. The probability of disease recurrence and
progression increases with increasing NMP22 levels.

NMP22 levels. Both prediction models are similar to the
‘‘cystoscopy for all patients’’ strategy at low threshold
probabilities, as expected. The prediction model that
includes age, sex, and NMP22 has the highest net benefit
at threshold probabilities > 8%. At a threshold probability of 8%, the net benefit of 0.001 can be interpreted as
identifying 1 additional patient with disease recurrence
per 1000 patients without an increase in the false-positive
rate (unnecessary cystoscopy) compared with the strategy
of treating all patients.
Table 3 illustrates the clinical implications of performing a cystoscopy based on the predicted risk of recurrence. The results indicate that offering cystoscopy only to
patients who have a risk  15% or to patients who are
identified from a model that includes NMP22, age, and
sex would reduce the number of cystoscopies by 23%
(229 per 1000 men with negative cystoscopy) while missing 25 cancer recurrences, and 3 of those recurrences
would be classified as T2 or greater. The same risk threshold from a model without NMP22 would avoid only 8%
of cystoscopies (75 per 1000 men) and would miss 5
recurrences, including 1 that was T2 or greater.
Despite a large improvement in predictive accuracy,
the full prediction model offers only a small clinical net
benefit over the ‘‘cystoscopy for all patients’’ strategy, and
only at threshold probabilities > 8%. This result probably

is because of the high prevalence of bladder cancer recurrence among patients who had negative cytology (26%).
When the outcome of interest was bladder cancer
progression, the range of threshold probabilities was
lower, because few patients would forgo a cytoscopy given
a moderate risk of disease progression. Figure 3 indicates
that, for threshold probabilities > 3%, there is a clinical
net benefit from using the prediction model that includes
NMP22 levels, age, and sex over a ‘‘cystoscopy for all’’
strategy. Table 4 lists the clinical implications of basing
the decision to undergo cystoscopy on various risk thresholds. Offering cystoscopy only to those with a risk  2%
from a model that includes NMP22, age, and sex would
reduce the number of cystoscopies by 12%, but this would
miss 3 cancer progressions. Using a higher threshold of
5% would avoid a greater number of cystoscopies (362
per 1000 men with a negative cystoscopy) while missing
only 9 cancer progressions, of which 2 would be T2 or
greater.

demonstrate that the marker is related significantly to outcome or is statistically significant in a multivariate model
that includes the standard clinical and pathologic factors.
Nor is it sufficient to demonstrate that the biomarker
improves predictive accuracy of over that of clinical and

2896

pathologic factors. In the current study, we used decisioncurve analysis to evaluate the implications of using
NMP22 in clinical practice.
In agreement with our previous findings,5 we
observed that the addition of NMP22 improves the accuracy of a base model that includes age and sex to predict
bladder cancer recurrence and progression by a statistically and clinically significant margin. The addition of
NMP22 increased the predictive accuracy of the base
model by 20.8% for disease recurrence and by 43% for
disease progression.
Although we demonstrated that NMP22 can
increase the predictive accuracy of the base model, our
previous study did not address whether this increase in accuracy translated into improved medical decision-making
or patient outcomes. Indeed, an improvement in predictive accuracy, although necessary, is not sufficient to assess
whether using a biomarker in practice actually would benefit patients. Establishing the clinical relevance of a biomarker test for guiding therapy decisions requires
demonstrating that it can classify patients into distinct
subgroups with different recommended management.
Predictive accuracy (ie, AUC) does not account for the
prevalence of the disease in the specific population. In
addition, sensitivity and specificity are given equal weight,
although missing bladder cancer is more harmful than an
unnecessary cystoscopy.
We observed that NMP22 helps in making decisions about immediate versus delayed cystoscopy if the
threshold for conducting a cystoscopy is a  8% risk of

disease recurrence or a  3% risk of disease progression.
For a very risk-averse clinician who would perform a cystoscopy even if, for instance, a patient had a 5% risk of recurrence or a 1% risk of progression, NMP22 would not
add any clinical benefit, and the optimal strategy would
be to offer cystoscopy to every patient at risk.
In conclusion, our results indicated that NMP22
measured in urine can help predict the results of cystoscopy in patients who are receiving surveillance for a history of nonmuscle-invasive bladder cancer. A multivariate
model that includes NMP22 can distinguish the patients
who should be advised to undergo cystoscopy and from
those who may be advised to defer cystoscopy until there
is stronger evidence of malignancy. Decisions regarding
immediate versus deferred cystoscopy on the basis of
NMP22 are likely to lead to better patient outcomes than
performing cystoscopy in everyone or using age and sex
alone to select patients for cytoscopy.
