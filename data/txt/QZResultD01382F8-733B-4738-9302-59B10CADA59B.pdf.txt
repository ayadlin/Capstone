Abstract
We have previously shown that talactoferrin-alfa (TLF), a
recombinant human lactoferrin, is an immunomodulatory
protein that is active against implanted tumors, both as a
single agent and in combination with chemotherapy. In this
study, we show that talactoferrin is active against autochthonous tumors in a transgenic mouse line, which is more
analogous to human cancers, and identify key mechanistic
steps involved in the anticancer activity of oral TLF. BALB/c
mice transgenic for the rat neu (ErbB2) oncogene (BALBneuT) treated with oral TLF showed a significant delay in
carcinogenesis, with 60% tumor protection relative to vehicletreated mice at week 21. Oral TLF also showed tumor growth
inhibition in wild-type BALB/c mice implanted with neu+
mammary adenocarcinoma, with one third displaying a longlasting or complete response. Oral TLF induces an increase in
intestinal mucosal IFN-; production and an increase in
Peyer’s patch cellularity, including expansion of CD8+ T
lymphocytes and NKT cells, and the enhancement of CD8+ Tcell cytotoxicity. In IFN-; knockout mice, there is an absence
of the TLF-induced Peyer’s patch cellularity, no expansion of
CD8+ T lymphocytes and NKT cells, and loss of TLF anticancer
activity. TLF antitumor activity is also lost in mice depleted of
CD8+ T cells and in CD1 knockout mice, which lack NKT
activity. Thus, the inhibition of distant tumors by oral TLF
seems to be mediated by an IFN-;–dependent enhancement of
CD8+ T- and NKT cell activity initiated within the intestinal
mucosa. [Cancer Res 2007;67(13):6425–32]

Introduction
In recent years, immunotherapeutic approaches to treating
cancer, with either adoptive transfer of immunity or stimulation of
the endogenous immune system, have shown increasing promise.
Talactoferrin-alfa (TLF), an immunomodulatory agent currently in
late-stage cancer clinical trials, acts through a novel mechanism of
action. Talactoferrin is a recombinant human lactoferrin (rhLF)
produced by fermentation in Aspergillus (1). Lactoferrin is an
important endogenous immunomodulatory protein, belonging to
the transferrin family of iron-binding glycoproteins (2). Endogenous lactoferrin is broadly distributed within the body and is found
in exocrine secretions (e.g., milk, tears, and saliva; ref. 3) and in
neutrophil-specific granules (4). Orally administered human
lactoferrin (hLF) has been shown to have anti-infective and
anticancer activity in animal models (5). hLF has been shown to

enhance host protection against a broad range of infections (6–8).
We have previously shown that oral TLF inhibits the growth of
implanted tumors at distant sites (9) and potentiates the antitumor
activity of cisplatin (10). However, little is known about the
anticancer and immunomodulatory activity of oral TLF against
autochthonous tumors. In this study, we examined the influence of
oral TLF on spontaneously arising mammary carcinomas in rat neu
(ErbB2) transgenic mice. This transgenic mouse model bears
mammary carcinomas that become evident after the progressive
stage of tumorigenesis, thereby providing a relationship between
the tumors and surrounding tissue (11). We show that oral TLF has
antitumor activity in transgenic mice.
Orally administered hLF has been shown to have systemic
immunostimulatory effects including (a) stimulation of Th1
cytokine response in splenocytes and lymph node cells (12–14),
(b) boosting of effector activity in peritoneal macrophages and
splenic natural killer (NK) cells (15), and (c) enhancement of
leukocyte numbers in blood and lymphoid tissues (16).
Oral TLF primarily targets the intestinal epithelial cells and
intestine-associated immune system (17) and is not absorbed
systemically (18–21). Oral lactoferrin also enhances interleukin-18
(IL-18) production (10, 19), a cytokine with pleiotropic effects on
immune cell activation and function (22). However, the effect of
oral lactoferrin on the intestinal and systemic immune system has
not been fully elucidated.
Here, we show in wild-type BALB/c mice bearing implanted
neu+ mammary adenocarcinomas that chronic oral TLF triggers
significant tumor inhibition, and one third of treated mice display a
long-lasting or complete response. Oral TLF seems to initiate an
immune activation in the gut and the gut-associated lymphoid
tissue (GALT). This results in an IFN-g–dependent increase in
number of NKT cells and CD8+ T lymphocytes in small intestinal
Peyer’s patches and systemic CTL activity. By using knockout or
immunodepleted mice, we have observed that TLF anticancer
activity is IFN-g dependent and requires CD8+ T lymphocyte and
NKT cell activity.

Materials and Methods
Mice. Virgin female BALB/c mice transgenic for rat neu oncogene
expressed under the control of mouse mammary tumor virus promoter
(BALB-neuT mice; ref. 23), wild-type BALB/c mice, BALB/c mice IFN-c gene
knockout (BALB-IFNgKO; ref. 24), and CD1 gene knockout (BALB-CD1KO;
ref. 25) were bred in our animal facility. Mice were randomly assigned to
control and treatment groups and were treated concurrently. Mammary
glands of BALB-neuT mice (23) and the challenge site of wild-type and KO
BALB/c mice (26) were inspected at weekly intervals to note tumor
appearance. Tumor masses were measured with caliper in two perpendicular diameters in a blind fashion to determine the longest diameter.
Progressively growing masses (>2-mm mean diameter) were regarded as
tumors. In BALB-neuT mice, tumor multiplicity was calculated as the

cumulative number of incident tumors per total number of mice and
reported as mean F SE (23). Mice were treated according to the European
Union guidelines. CD8 lymphocyte depletion was done by i.p. injections of
0.2 mL of HBSS containing 500 Ag anti-CD8 monoclonal antibody (mAb;
TIB-105 hybridoma, Lyt-2; American Type Culture Collection) or vehicle,
1 day before and 2, 5, 8, 11, 14, and 17 days after tumor challenge (day 0).
Flow cytometry of residual blood collected 3 days after the last injection
showed that CD8+ T cells were decreased to a level below 1 in 5,000 cells.
Cell line and tumor challenge. TUBO cells are a cloned line generated
from a BALB-neuT mouse mammary gland carcinoma and express large
amounts of neu protein (11). TUBO cells were cultured in DMEM with
20% fetal bovine serum (FBS). Mice were challenged s.c. in the left flank
with 0.2 mL of a single suspension of a minimal lethal dose of TUBO cells
(1  105) in HBSS (27) and monitored for 105 days. At the end of this period,
tumor-free mice were classed as survivors, whereas those with tumors were
sacrificed. Mice with a tumor mass exceeding 10 mm in mean diameter
were sacrificed for humane reasons.
TLF administration. TLF was provided in a phosphate-buffered solution
[6 mmol/L sodium phosphate monobasic monohydrate, 9 mmol/L sodium
phosphate dibasic heptahydrate, 50 mmol/L sodium chloride (pH 7.0 F
0.5)] at a concentration of 100 F 10 mg/mL. It was stored frozen at 20jC
before dosing. Mice were randomly divided into experimental groups and
treated orally by gavage with TLF (1,000 mg/kg, 3 mg/m2) or vehicle. In
mice with implanted tumors, TLF administration occurred once daily,
5 days per week for 3 weeks, except when otherwise specified. In the
transgenic mice experiments, TLF was administered once daily, 5 days per
week, 3 weeks on and 1 week rest. TLF administration was started on week
6 and continued until week 30.
Counts and flow cytometry of Peyer’s patch cells. Three days after
oral TLF ingestion, mice were sacrificed, and the first three Peyer’s patches
of small intestinal epithelium were collected, and a single-cell suspension
was obtained and counted in a blind fashion using a Burker’s chamber. Cells
(3  105) excluding trypan blue (Life Technologies/Invitrogen) were stained
immediately with mAb anti-CD8a phycoerythrin (PE)–conjugated (Cedarlane), anti-CD49b PE (PharMingen), and anti-CD3 FITC (PharMingen). After
30 min of incubation at 4jC, the cells were washed in Dulbecco’s modified
PBS supplemented with 0.1% sodium azide and 2% FBS and analyzed with a
CyAn ADP machine (DakoCytomation) using Summit 4.2 software
(DakoCytomation).
In vivo cytotoxicity assay. In vivo cytotoxicity assay was done as
previously described (28). Briefly, a single-cell suspension of 10  106 naive
spleen cells (Spc) per milliliter was labeled with two different concen-

trations (0.5 Amol/L, CFSE low or 5.0 Amol/L, CFSE high) of the fluorescent
dye CFSE (Molecular Probes). Spc labeled with 5.0 Amol/L were also pulsed
with the dominant 9-mer 63-71 peptide of the protein product of rat neu
oncogene with H-2Kd restriction element (29) for 1 h at room temperature.
The two Spc populations were mixed together in equal amounts and
injected i.v. into control and treated mice that had received or did not
receive TUBO cells s.c. Mice were sacrificed 48 h later, and single-cell
suspensions from spleens were processed individually to evaluate CFSE high
and CFSE low cells by CyAn ADP (DakoCytomation). Specific cytolytic
activity was calculated as follows: 100  (percentage CFSE low cells
percentage CFSE high cells) / percentage CFSE low cells (28).
IFN-; production and intracellular staining. Small intestinal epithelial
tissue was collected and homogenized as described by Kuhara et al. (30).
Briefly, a known weight of small intestinal tissue was placed in a lysis buffer
consisting of PBS, 1% NP40, 0.5% Na deoxycholate, and 0.1% SDS containing
10 mg/mL of phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, a general protease inhibitor
(Sigma-Aldrich). The tissue was mechanically homogenized, and the
suspension was centrifuged at 15,000 rpm for 10 min. The clear supernatant
was collected in 100-AL aliquots and stored at 80jC until use. An ELISA kit
(R&D Systems) was used to determine the IFN-g content of the aliquots.
The Peyer’s patches were incubated for 30 min at 4jC with directly
conjugated FITC anti-CD8 (Cedarlane). The cells were washed with
Dulbecco’s modified PBS with 0.1% sodium azide and 2% FBS. Cell pellets
were resuspended in 1 mL of Fix/Perm (eBioscience), and the samples were
incubated overnight at 4jC. After two washes with Permeabilization buffer
(eBioscience), the samples were incubated at 4jC with 2 AL of Fc receptor
blocker (PharMingen) for 15 min followed by PE anti-IFN-g (PharMingen)
for 30 min. The cells were washed twice before conducting flow cytometric
analysis. Single- and double-stained samples were used for instrumentation
setup. Flow cytometric analysis was done with a CyAn ADP machine
(DakoCytomation) using Summit 4.2 software (DakoCytomation).
Statistics. Differences in tumor incidence were evaluated with the MantelHaenszel log-rank test. Tumor multiplicity, number of positive cells at flow
cytometry, and ELISA were analyzed using the Student’s t test (two tailed).

Results
Oral TLF inhibits autochthonous carcinogenesis in neu
transgenic mice. The neu transgenic mice used in this study have
a 100% penetrance of mammary carcinogenesis. Mammary cells
overexpressing neu first manifest atypical hyperplasia by about
4 weeks of age. In week 7, the hyperplastic condition progresses to

multifocal preneoplastic lesions (11). At least one carcinoma (>2-mm
mean diameter) is palpable in each untreated control mouse by week
21 (Fig. 1A), and by week 31, a tumor mass is palpable in all 10
mammary glands (Fig. 1B). Oral TLF (3 mg/m2) significantly delayed
cancer progression, extending both the mouse disease-free survival
and reducing tumor multiplicity (Fig. 1A and B).
Oral TLF inhibits the growth of implanted neu+ tumors.
BALB-neuT mouse autochthonous mammary carcinogenesis is an

inexorable but slow process and requires about 20 weeks to become
clinically evident (11). In contrast, implantation of neu+ TUBO cells
in wild-type BALB/c mice is a more rapid process. Implantation of a
100% lethal dose of neu+ TUBO cells results in the formation of a
tumor mass (>2-mm mean diameter) in about 3 weeks (26). Even in
the more rapidly growing TUBO model, TLF showed anticancer
activity (Fig. 2). In the vehicle-treated control mice, the tumors grew
steadily, and all 14 mice were sacrificed by day 54 due to large tumor

lymphoid cells in Peyer’s patches (D ; groups of six mice) nor induced an expansion of CD8+ T cells (E) and CD49b+/CD3+ cells (F ). Over six mice per group
were individually evaluated.

outgrowth (Fig. 2). By contrast, a markedly delayed growth of TUBO
tumor was evident in about half of the mice receiving oral TLF. In
27% of them, 105 days after challenge, the tumor masses were <3-mm
mean diameter. This unique finding shows that oral TLF inhibits
tumor proliferation, and that its effect persists for over 3 months
after completion of dosing.
Peyer’s patch reactivity associated with TLF administration.
Oral TLF has been shown to have several immunologic effects (31),
and we have tried to characterize the key mechanisms that play a
critical role in inhibiting TUBO challenge. Because the GALT is an
important target for oral TLF, we evaluated the cellularity of Peyer’s
patches in tumor-challenged mice after 3 days of TLF treatment.
The number of cells in the Peyer’s patches increased by about a
third (Fig. 3A), suggesting a high proliferative activity following TLF
administration. Although the relative percentage of B220+ B cells,
CD4+ T cells, and CD49b+ cells only slightly changed (data not
shown), the percentage of CD8+ T cells (5; Fig. 3B) and CD49b+/
CD3+ NKT cells (2.5; Fig. 3C) increased substantially when
compared with controls. The absolute number of CD8+ T cells was
0.5 to 1  105 in control mice and increased to 2.7 to 4.5  105 in
TLF-treated mice, whereas that of CD49b+/CD3+ NKT cells
increased from 1.3 to 2.3  104 to 4.3 to 7.2  104. No significant
increase in CD8+ T-cell numbers was observed in mesenteric lymph
nodes and spleen (data not shown).
Both CD8+ T and NKT cells are required for TLF-activated
tumor inhibition. As CD8+ T lymphocytes and NKT cells are
important effectors involved in immune-mediated killing of cancer
cells (32, 33), we assessed whether these TLF-activated cell
populations play a significant role in the inhibition of TUBO cell
tumors. BALB/c mice either remained untreated (Fig. 4C) or were
depleted of CD8+ cells through i.p. administrations of anti-Lyt-2
hybridoma (TIB-105 hybridoma) before TUBO cell challenge and
during TUBO cell growth (Fig. 4A). Oral TLF no longer showed any
antitumor activity in the CD8+ T cell–depleted mice. A similar loss
of TLF anticancer activity was observed in BALB/c mice KO for the
CD1d gene, which is required for NKT cell development (ref. 31;
Fig. 4B).
To confirm the role of CD8+ T lymphocytes in the anticancer
response induced by oral TLF, we did an in vivo CTL assay. In vivo
cytotoxicity was evaluated in both naive BALB/c mice treated for
2 weeks with TLF only and mice challenged with TUBO cells 2 days

after the beginning of TLF administration. TLF alone did not
enhance the cytotoxic response against the dominant rat neu
peptide (Fig. 4D). Following TUBO cell challenge, an anti-neu
cytotoxic response was evident and was enhanced when the TUBO
challenge was combined with TLF treatment.
Importance of IFN-; in TLF-activated antitumor resistance.
Because IFN-g is a key cytokine involved in early immune events,
we examined the effect of oral TLF on IFN-g production. When
mice were treated with TLF for 24 h, there was a 3-fold increase in
intestinal IFN-g (Fig. 5A). There was also an increase in CD8+ T
cells with intracytoplasmatic IFN-g in the Peyer’s patches (Fig. 5B).
These data suggest that IFN-g plays an important role in the
immunostimulatory events leading to oral TLF anticancer activity.
We used IFN-g KO mice to confirm the role played by IFN-g in
mediating TLF anticancer activity. In the BALB-IFNgKO mice, the
TLF-induced increase in Peyer’s patch cellularity is no longer
evident, and the proportion of CD8+ T cells and CD49b+/CD3+ NKT
cells is no longer increased (Fig. 3D–F). Furthermore, the
anticancer activity mediated by oral TLF is also absent in BALBIFNgKO mice (Fig. 4C).

Discussion
Our investigations have shown that oral administration of TLF
significantly inhibits both the development of tumors in neu
transgenic mice and the growth of neu+ implanted tumors. In an
early event, oral TLF triggered the release of IFN-g by the intestinal
mucosa lymphocytes. This was followed by an IFN-g–dependent
increase in Peyer’s patches cellularity and an expansion of CD8+ T
cells and CD49b+/CD3+ NKT cells. The critical role played by IFNg,
NKT cells, and neu-specific CD8+ T lymphocytes in mediating TLF
anticancer activity was shown using knockout mice, mice depleted
of CD8+ T cells, and an in vivo cytotoxicity assay.
We have previously reported antitumor activity of oral TLF against
a range of implanted tumors in mice (10). Furthermore, TLF has also
shown apparent anticancer activity in human clinical trials
including phase I/II clinical trials with a range of solid tumors (19)
and phase II trials in renal cell cancer (34) and non–small-cell lung
cancer (35). In the present study, we have also assessed the ability of
oral TLF to inhibit the chronic but inexorable progression of
autochthonous mammary lesions. BALB-neuT mice are transgenic

Figure 6. Outline of early events involved in oral TLF antitumor activity. Oral TLF interacts with TLF receptors expressed on epithelial cells of the gut and infiltrating
lymphoid cells, thus inducing the secretion of IL-18 (15) and IFN-g, an increase in Peyer’s patches cellularity, including CD8+ T and NKT cells, and a subsequent
systemic immunostimulation (15). Oral TLF anticancer activity seems to be related to increases in IFN-g, CD8+ T cells, and NKT cells as indicated by loss of TLF
anticancer activity in knockout and immunodepleted animals. Moreover, either directly or through the induction of downstream cytokines, TLF may trigger the maturation
of dendritic cells. TLF matured dendritic cells loaded with tumor antigens may, thus, play an important role in the specific activation of CD8+ T-cell cytolitic activity and
act as a critical link between innate and adaptive immune response mechanisms boosted by TLF.

for the rat neu transforming oncogene under the transcriptional
control of the long terminal repeat sequence of the mammary tumor
virus. The virgin BALB-neuT female mouse provides one of the most
aggressive models of neu mammary carcinogenesis with autochthonous mammary tumors that spontaneously develop in situ and
are hence much more analogous to human cancers than implanted
tumors. These mice develop mammary carcinomas in all their
mammary glands with 100% incidence. The atypical mammary
hyperplasia condition is generated by cells overexpressing neu and
is first evident at 4 weeks of age. It progresses to multifocal preneoplastic lesions around week 7, and multiple invasive carcinomas
are pathologically detectable in each mammary gland by week 22
(36, 37). This progression is accompanied by the accumulation of
CD4+CD25+Foxp3+ T regulatory cells in the draining lymph nodes
and mammary lesions (28) and suppressive immature myeloid cell
expansion in the blood and spleen (38). Oral TLF provided
protection against tumor development in this autochthonous model,
with a 20% increase in median tumor-free survival. Because neuinduced mammary carcinogenesis in this transgenic model is very
similar to tumor progression in humans, TLF may be of value in
inhibiting the progression of early cancerous lesions in patients
in addition to its promise in treating established tumors (34, 35).
Cancer patients are usually immunosuppressed, with the tumor
itself often generating immunosuppressive factors. Chemotherapy
itself further damages immunologic function along with the other
adverse events resulting from toxicity to rapidly growing cells.
Because oral TLF does not manifest systemic adverse effects (it has
been administered to over 475 people without a single drug-related

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (13). July 1, 2007

serious adverse event), it promises a more favorable efficacy/
toxicity trade-off than conventional chemotherapy. In addition,
oral lactoferrin has been shown to help protect against common
adverse events associated with chemotherapy including cytopenias
(39) and gut toxicities (40).
Immunotherapeutic approaches have been viewed as an
important additional modality in treating cancer, and restoration
of immune function could help responders remain disease-free for
extended periods of time. Unfortunately, approved approaches
including IL-2 and IFN-g infusion have been associated with
limited efficacy and high toxicities. Because the complex immune
system requires multiple humoral and cellular factors acting in
concert to induce effective immunostimulation, it is not surprising
that infusion of individual cytokines have limited efficacy.
Furthermore, to achieve physiologically relevant concentrations
of cytokines within the immune system, extremely high systemic
levels are required, resulting in the severe toxicities associated with
cytokine administration. In contrast, as expected with an orally
administered protein, TLF is not systemically bioavailable (19, 21).
Instead, TLF acts in the gut and GALT, the largest immune organ in
the body and a physiologically relevant site of lactoferrin activity. In
this work, we have identified some of the early steps involved in the
ability of TLF to induce systemic anticancer activity through
immunostimulation at the GALT.
We have previously shown that oral TLF induces IL-18
production within intestinal mucosa (10). In this work, we
examined changes in other key cytokines and immune cells.
Considering that IL-18 stimulates production of IFN-g (41), a

cytokine with great immunomodulatory activity, the finding that
IFN-g is a key early cytokine required for oral TLF anticancer
activity was not unexpected. There was a marked increase in IFN-g
production in the intestinal mucosa and CD8+ T cells in Peyer’s
patches, and the TLF-induced increases in small intestinal Peyer’s
patch cellularity and CD8+ T and NKT cells numbers were
abolished in IFN-g knockout mice. The importance of these events
was further supported by the loss of TLF antitumor activity in mice
deficient in IFN-g, NKT cells, and CD8+ T cells, consistent with the
role played by these mediators. CD8+ T lymphocytes are known to
be key cytotoxic effector cells mediating tumor killing and
following polyclonal activation in the gut; CD8+ T lymphocytes
may be expected to migrate to distant tumor draining lymph nodes
and tumors to mediate tumor killing. Present data showing that
TLF treatment leads to the generation of an enhanced cytotoxic
activity against neu suggest that when cytotoxic T cells are
activated by xenogeneic neu peptides, TLF enhances their specific
cytotoxic activity. This enhancement may result from a direct
activity of TLF on antigen poised CD8+ T cells. However, recent
observations suggest that TLF also induces dendritic cell
maturation.3 TLF-differentiated dendritic cells loaded with tumor
cell antigens may migrate to lymphoid organs (e.g., Peyer’s patches
and lymph nodes) and present neu peptides to CD8+ T cells.
Alternatively, CD8+ T cells polyclonally triggered by TLF in Peyer’s
patches may receive effective differentiation signals from antigenpulsed dendritic cells maturated in the presence of TLF or TLFinduced downstream cytokines (Fig. 6).
Although CD8+ T cells are required for tumor inhibition, the loss
of the protective activity of TLF in BALB-CD1KO mice suggests
that NKT cells are also necessary for the antitumor effect of TLF.
NKT cells may act as both effector and regulatory cells (42). NKT
cells migrating to and accumulating within tumors play an effector
role, whereas circulating NKT cells are also regulatory (43). The key
role that NKT cells assume in the antitumor reaction triggered by

TLF is not surprising as it mirrors the powerful antitumor activity
displayed by NKT cells triggered by a-galactosylceramide (33). On
the other hand, the disappearance of TLF-elicited protection
against neu+ tumors in mice lacking either CD8+ T or NKT cells
shows that these two cell populations with markedly different
specificity are both required.
The characterization of these mechanisms fits in well with
previous data suggesting IL-18 and IFN-g release, along with T and
NK cell activation, as possible key events in the antitumor activity
of oral TLF (10, 30). It is not surprising to observe the role of TLF in
innate and adaptive immunity because this is consistent with the
physiologic role of lactoferrin. Transgenic mice expressing human
lactoferrin exhibited enhanced Th1 immune polarization (13).
Furthermore, lactoferrin found in colostrum and milk has been
shown to play an important immunomodulatory role, including
helping to establish the GALT and strengthen the Th1 axis
systemically.
TLF is a promising new immunomodulatory molecule with a
novel mechanism of action. The molecule seems to be safe and well
tolerated and has exhibited anticancer activity against renal cell
cancer, non–small-cell lung cancer, and other tumor types in
preclinical work and in phase I/II and phase II human clinical
trials. In this work, we identify some of the early events involved in
TLF-induced immunomodulation and link them to TLF anticancer
activity. Additional work is under way to identify additional critical
roles that may be played by TLF, including dendritic cell
maturation and enhancement of the cross-presentation of tumor
antigens to CD8+ T cells.
