Abstract
Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

The relative contribution of the effector molecules produced by T cells to tumour rejection is
unclear, but interferon-γ (IFNγ) is critical in most of the analysed models1. Although IFNγ can
impede tumour growth by acting directly on cancer cells2,3, it must also act on the tumour stroma
for effective rejection of large, established tumours4,5. However, which stroma cells respond to
IFNγ and by which mechanism IFNγ contributes to tumour rejection through stromal targeting
have remained unknown. Here we use a model of IFNγ induction and an IFNγ–GFP fusion
protein in large, vascularized tumours growing in mice that express the IFNγ receptor exclusively
in defined cell types. Responsiveness to IFNγ by myeloid cells and other haematopoietic cells,
including T cells or fibroblasts, was not sufficient for IFNγ-induced tumour regression, whereas
responsiveness of endothelial cells to IFNγ was necessary and sufficient. Intravital microscopy
revealed IFNγ-induced regression of the tumour vasculature, resulting in arrest of blood flow and
subsequent collapse of tumours, similar to non-haemorrhagic necrosis in ischaemia and unlike
haemorrhagic necrosis induced by tumour necrosis factor. The early events of IFNγ-induced
tumour ischaemia resemble non-apoptotic blood vessel regression during development, wound
healing or IFNγ-mediated, pregnancy-induced remodelling of uterine arteries6–8. A better
mechanistic understanding of how solid tumours are rejected may aid the design of more effective
protocols for adoptive T-cell therapy.

The contribution of T-cell effector molecules to tumour rejection has mainly been studied in
models of low tumour burden with little tumour stroma1,9. For IFNγ -mediated effects,
various cell types have been suggested as targets, such as the cancer cells themselves,
macrophages, fibroblasts, monocytes or endothelial cells10–18. Most cells of the body
express the IFNγ receptor (IFNγR). IFNγ inhibits neoangiogenesis and prevents the
development of tumours from inoculated cancer cells12,13, but the effects of IFNγ on blood
vessels of large established tumours are poorly understood. As human cancers are usually at
least 1 cm in diameter when they are first detected, studying the effects of IFNγ on the
vasculature of such tumours is clinically relevant. We transduced the fibrosarcoma cell line
MCA313, derived from a methylcholanthrene-treated IFNγR-deficient C57BL/6 (IFNγR−)
mouse, with a retrovirus allowing doxycycline (dox)-mediated regulation of IFNγ
expression (MCA313IFNγ-IND)19,20 (Fig. 1a). MCA313IFNγ-IND cells produced IFNγ upon
treatment with dox (around 87 ng ml−1), but not in its absence (Fig. 1b). When IFNγ was
induced in large MCA313IFNγ-IND tumours in immunocompromised Rag-deficient (Rag−)
mice, serum levels reached a peak of around 10 ng ml−1 48 h after dox administration (Fig.
1c). Induction of IFNγ in two- to three-week-old large MCA313IFNγ-IND tumours in
C57BL/6 wild-type mice led to tumour regression, macroscopic and microscopic necrosis,
and loss of tumour endothelial (CD31+) cells (Extended Data Fig. 1a–c). Tumour regression
was observed in wild-type but not in IFNγR− mice (Extended Data Fig. 1a).
MCA313IFNγ-IND tumours grew with similar kinetics and regressed similarly upon IFNγ
induction in wild-type and Rag− mice, indicating their low immunogenicity (Extended Data
Fig. 1a). To determine whether dox-induced IFNγ levels were comparable to those achieved
by antigen-specific T cells that rejected established tumours of a similar size, we treated
Rag− mice bearing 16.113 adenocarcinomas with CD8+ T cells, which are specific for SV40
large T antigen expressed by 16.113 cells (TCR-I T cells), and determined IFNγ serum

levels 3–7 days after T-cell transfer. On day 4, around 13 ng ml−1 IFNγ was detected (Fig.
1c) and tumours were subsequently rejected (Extended Data Fig. 1d). Thus, IFNγ
expression in large MCA313IFNγ-IND tumours was comparable to that of effector T cells
during tumour rejection and was sufficient to induce tumour regression, when only tumour
stroma, and no cancer cells, could respond to IFNγ. Similarly, IFNγ induction in large
IFNγ-insensitive 16.113-999IFNγ-IND adenocarcinomas resulted in tumour regression and a
reduction in tumour endothelial cells (Extended Data Fig. 1e–g).

To identify the target stromal cells of IFNγ, we generated mice with exclusive IFNγR
expression in defined cell types. In these mice, the Ifngr1 transgene is linked to a GFP
reporter gene by an internal ribosome entry site (IRES) and separated from a ubiquitous
promoter by a Cre-recombinase-excisable stop cassette (pCAGloxPStoploxP-IFNγ R-IRESGFP, denoted hereafter as PIG mice; Fig. 1a, Extended Data Fig. 2a). The mice were crossed
to IFNγR− mice to inactivate the endogenous Ifngr1 gene (PIGΔIFNγR). Expression of the
Cre recombinase in fibroblasts from PIGΔIFNγR mice led to IFNγR (CD119) and GFP
expression (Extended Data Fig. 2b). IFNγ exposure caused upregulation of major
histocompatibility complex I (MHC-I) comparable to wild-type fibroblasts, demonstrating
the function and tight regulation of IFNγR (Extended Data Fig. 2c). We generated
PIGΔIFNγR × CMV-Cre mice, in which expression of Cre recombinase is ubiquitously driven
by the human CMV promoter (PIGCMV-Cre mice). Most stromal cells of MCA313IFNγ-IND
tumours grown in PIGCMV-Cre mice were GFP+, as analysed for CD11b+ (myeloid), F4/80+
(macrophages), CD31+ (endothelial) and FAP+ (mesenchymal) cells (Extended Data Fig.
2d). Most cells in the peripheral blood (T cells, B cells, natural killer cells, CD11b+, CD11c+
and GR1+ cells) were GFP+ (Supplementary Table 1a). No GFP+ cells were detected in
MCA313IFNγ-IND tumours of PIGΔIFNγR mice (Supplementary Table 1b, Extended Data
Fig. 2e). Dox-induced IFNγ expression in large MCA313IFNγ-IND tumours in PIGCMV-Cre,
but not in PIGΔIFNγR mice, induced necrosis, loss of endothelial cells and tumour
regression, indicating that the model allowed the identification of the stromal targets of
IFNγ (Fig. 1d–i).

As (Tie2+) macrophages not only support neo-vascularization in tumours21, but also secrete
anti-angiogenic cytokines in response to IFNγ14,15, we analysed PIGΔIFNγR mice with Cre
expression driven by the lysozyme promoter (PIGLys-Cre mice), with exclusive IFNγR
expression in cells of the myeloid lineage (Supplementary Table 1a). In MCA313IFNγ-IND
tumours, most CD11b+ and F4/80+ cells, but not CD31+ or FAP+ cells, were GFP+ and
therefore responsive to IFNγ (Extended Data Fig. 3a). IFNγ induction in established
MCA313IFNγ-IND tumours of PIGLys-Cre mice did not induce necrosis, reduce numbers of
endothelial (CD31+) cells or delay tumour growth (Fig. 2a–c). Thus, exposing exclusively
myeloid cells in established tumours to IFNγ does not lead to cancer regression.
We generated PIGΔIFNγR mice expressing FSP-Cre (PIGFSP-Cre mice) in which one fourth of
tail fibroblasts and most haematopoietic cells, but not endothelial cells, were GFP+ and
therefore expressed IFNγR (Extended Data Fig. 3b, Supplementary Table 1a). In
MCA313IFNγ-IND tumours, CD11b+, F4/80+ and FAP+ cells, but not CD31+ cells, had
recombined, as indicated by GFP expression (Extended Data Fig. 3c). IFNγ induction in
established MCA313IFNγ-IND tumours of PIGFSP-Cre mice did not lead to macroscopic

necrosis, microscopic endothelial cell loss or tumour regression (Fig. 2d–f). To confirm that
IFNγ signalling in T cells does not contribute to blood vessel reduction, we reconstituted
Rag− or Rag−IFNγR− mice with wild-type splenocytes and induced IFNγ in established
MCA313IFNγ-IND tumours. In T-cell-reconstituted Rag− recipients, but not Rag−IFNγR−
recipients, endothelial cell numbers were reduced after IFNγ induction (Extended Data Fig.
3d). Thus, response to IFNγ by tumour-associated fibroblasts, T cells or haematopoietic
cells was not sufficient for IFNγ-induced tumour necrosis or regression.

We next analysed mice with selective IFNγR expression in endothelial cells using PDGFBCreER-IRES-GFP mice. Because these mice, in which recombination is tamoxifen-inducible
in PDGFB+ cells, and PIGΔIFNγR mice both carry GFP reporter genes, recombination was
analysed in tamoxifen-treated PDGFB-CreER-IRES-GFP × Rosa26-RFP mice bearing large
MCA313IFNγ-IND tumours. Around 75.4% of tumour endothelial cells (CD31+CD146+) had
recombined, indicated by RFP expression (Extended Data Fig. 4a, b). To avoid confounding
effects by endogenous IFNγ (Extended Data Fig. 4c–g), experiments were performed in
PIGΔIFNγR × PDGFB-CreER-IRES-GFP × IFNγ− (PIGPDGFB-Cre-ΔIFNγ) transgenic mice,
which are deficient in IFNγ and IFNγR expression and allow selective induction of IFNγR
expression in endothelial cells. GFP was almost exclusively expressed in tumour endothelial
cells and faithfully monitored IFNγR expression (Extended Data Fig. 5a, b). The few GFP+
CD11b+ cells that were present did not respond to IFNγ with inducible nitric oxide synthase
induction (Supplementary Table 1b, Extended Data Fig. 5c). IFNγ induction in large
MCA313IFNγ-IND tumours in tamoxifen-treated PIGPDGFB-Cre-ΔIFNγ mice induced necrosis,
disappearance of endothelial cells and tumour regression (Fig. 2g – i). Following regression,
tumours slowly resumed growth (Fig. 2i). However, these tumours contained large central
necrotic areas with viable cells at the rim (Extended Data Fig. 5d, e). As opposed to
endothelial cells without IFNγ induction, endothelial cells in tumours exposed for around 50
days to IFNγ were mostly GFP−, suggesting a strong selective pressure against IFNγRexpressing endothelial cells (Fig. 2j). In line with this assumption, tumours grown for 50–
100 days in PIGPDGFB-Cre or PIGCMV-Cre mice still produced inducible IFNγ in vitro
(Extended Data Fig. 5f). After five days of IFNγ exposure, endothelial cells
(CD31+CD146+) in MCA313IFNγ-IND tumours of all of the mice investigated in this study
were reduced by 80–90% only in tumours from mice containing endothelial cells that could
respond to IFNγ (Fig. 2k). To determine whether T-cell-derived IFNγ similarly affects
endothelial cells, Rag− mice bearing 16.113 tumours were treated with IFNγ-competent or
IFNγ-deficient TCR-I CD8+ T cells. Five days after T-cell transfer, we found a significantly
lower number of endothelial cells in tumours treated with wild-type T cells than in those
treated with IFNγ-deficient T cells (Extended Data Fig. 1h). IFNγ R responsiveness by
tumour endothelial cells was necessary and sufficient for necrosis and tumour regression.
We intravitally imaged the same area of tumours that were growing behind a glass window
over several days22. To better assess the kinetics of vascular regression by IFNγ, a doxinducible Ifng-GFP fusion gene was introduced into plasmacytoma J558L cells
(J558LIFNγ–GFP-IND), which are resistant to cytotoxic effects of IFNγ and TNF (see
below)23. To monitor cancer cells, J558LIFNγ-GFP-INDcells additionally expressed the
fluorescent (cerulean) protein. J558LIFNγ–GFP-IND cells produced around 104 ng ml−1
biologically active IFNγ–GFP (Fig. 3a, b) and could be visualized by intravital microscopy

(Supplementary Videos 1, 2). Its induction in established J558LIFNγ–GFP-IND tumours
growing in Rag− mice led to tumour regression (Extended Data Fig. 6a). Large vascularized
J558LIFNγ–GFP-IND tumours growing behind a window were imaged for 6 days following
dox application. A GFP signal was observed 24 h after IFNγ–GFP induction, and vascular
density decreased with a loss of smaller blood vessels and thinning of larger vessels (Fig.
3c). At 48 h, blood vessels further decreased and were undetectable by 96 h of dox
treatment. As shown by loss of cerulean signal, cancer cells were destroyed subsequent to
blood vessel regression (Fig. 3d, Extended Data Fig. 6b). DiD-labelled erythrocytes, injected
before imaging, did not leak from the tumour vessels during the entire longitudinal imaging.
Instead, the blood flow ceased with progressing vessel regression (Supplementary Video 3),
showing that IFNγ induces tumour ischaemia.

We performed similar experiments with TNF, which is usually produced simultaneously
with IFNγ by activated T cells. We generated cerulean+ J558LTNF-GFP-IND cells with an
inducible TNF-GFP fusion protein. J558LTNF-GFP-IND cells produced 368 pg ml−1
biologically active TNF–GFP upon dox application (Fig. 3e, f). Induction of TNF–GFP in
established J558LTNF-GFP-IND tumours growing in Rag− mice led to tumour regression
(Extended Data Fig. 7a). Imaging revealed notably different changes caused by TNF–GFP
compared to IFNγ-GFP. The TNF–GFP signal was observed after 24 h and blood vessels
did not become thinner but, if anything, wider (Fig. 3g, Extended Data Fig. 7b). By around
36 h after TNF–GFP induction, the blood vessels burst and DiD-labelled erythrocytes leaked
into the tumour tissue (Supplementary Video 4); cancer cells decayed following vessel burst
(Fig. 3h). In J558LTNF-GFP-IND tumours, erythrocytes were dispersed throughout the tissue
48 h after TNF–GFP induction, whereas in J558LIFNγ-GFP-IND tumours they remained
within blood vessels (Extended Data Fig. 8a, b). Necrosis caused by IFNγ was induced by
ischaemic shutdown of perfusion rather than by bursting of the blood vessels as was
observed for TNF.

Endothelial cells in kidney and spleen of wild-type mice 5 days after dox treatment were
unaltered (Extended Data Fig. 9a), indicating a relative selective effect on the (activated)
tumour vasculature. Gene expression profiling of normal kidney and tumour endothelial
cells revealed 1,500 differentially expressed genes. After IFNγ induction, the expression of
356 genes changed in kidney and 42 in tumour endothelial cells. Only 17 genes were
exclusively regulated in tumour endothelial cells (Extended Data Fig. 9b). Activated
endothelium occurs physiologically, for example, during development, pregnancy-induced
vascular remodelling and wound healing. In PIGPDGFB-Cre-ΔIFNγ mice and wild-type mice
with elevated IFNγ levels from small MCA313IFNγ-IND tumours, wounds did not heal in
contrast to IFNγ R− mice, suggesting a selective effect of IFNγ on activated endothelium
(Extended Data Fig. 5g, h). To further elaborate on this hypothesis, we determined the gene
expression profile of IFNγ -exposed endothelial cells of MCA313IFNγ-IND and
J558LIFNγ-GFP-IND tumours as well as 16.113 tumours treated by adoptive T-cell therapy
(Extended Data Fig. 9c, Supplementary Table 2). Endothelial cells from all three tumours
showed strong similarity in regulated genes. Genes associated with immune regulation and
migration, for example, CXCL10 and CXCL11 (Extended Data Fig. 9c, Supplementary
Table 2), were highly regulated. It is well-established that CXCL10 has anti-angiogenic

unexpected that the tumour endothelial cells produce CXCL107,14–16.

We did not observe apoptosis-associated genes to be highly regulated in IFNγ-exposed
endothelial cells (Supplementary Table 2). Rather, IFNγ-exposed endothelial (ERG+ or
CD31+) cells in MCA313IFNγ-IND tumours gradually decreased over a period of 5 days
(Extended Data Fig. 10a – e). Although the total cleaved caspase 3+ (CC3+) area increased
(Extended Data Fig. 10f), the number of CC3+ endothelial cells did not (Extended Data Fig.
10c). Endothelial cells significantly decreased not only in necrotic but also in vital tumour
tissue (Extended Data Fig. 10b). Reduction in endothelial cells preceded decrease in
collagen IV (Extended Data Fig. 10g – i). NG2+ pericytes did not decrease (Extended Data
Fig. 10j, k), and we did not observe reduced co-localization with endothelial cells (Extended
Data Fig. 10l). Therefore, we assume that primarily pericyte-uncovered endothelial cells
disappeared during the first 5 days of IFNγ exposure. IFNγ exposure led to rapid rounding
and condensation of CD31+ and VE-cadherin+ endothelial cells in MCA313IFNγ-IND
tumours, similar to that observed for regressing blood vessels during the ovarian cycle24,25
(Extended Data Fig. 10m). In line with earlier studies on physiological blood vessel
regression25, electron microscopy showed that the vessels were more frequently occluded
upon IFNγ exposure (Extended Data Fig. 10n, o). IFNγ also induced profound
morphological changes of human umbilical vein endothelial cells in vitro without indication
of apoptosis (Extended Data Fig. 9e, Supplementary Video 5). In the J558L model, we
confirmed reduction of endothelial (ERG+ or CD31+) cells by IFNγ –GFP fusion protein
(Extended Data Fig. 6c – g) and found that TNF–GFP did not significantly change
endothelial cell numbers during the first five days of cytokine exposure (Extended Data Fig.
7f, g). Collectively, we observed a process, which involves lumen collapse/ vessel occlusion
and progressive disappearance of first small and then large calibre vessels. These
characteristics of controlled blood vessel regression suggest that IFNγ induces changes in
the tumour vasculature similar to those observed during physiological blood vessel
regression. Irf4, upregulated by IFNγ in tumour but not normal endothelial cells (Extended
Data Fig. 9b, c, Supplementary Table 2), has not been reported to be induced by IFNγ in
(tumour) endothelial cells and was induced in vitro by IFNγ in mouse endothelial cells
(Extended Data Fig. 9f). Endothelial cells in large MCA313IFNγ-IND tumours two days after
IFNγ induction in Irf4-deficient mice revealed a more pronounced vessel reduction
(Extended Data Fig. 9g, h) and an increased number of apoptotic endothelial cells compared
to those in wild-type mice (Extended Data Fig. 9i, j), reminiscent of the protective role of
IRF4 for neurons in ischaemia26.

We showed that ischaemia, a pathological reaction, is beneficial in anti-tumour responses.
Both, IFNγ and TNF destroy tumour blood vessels, yet by different mechanisms and with
different consequences. IFNγ released by tumours did not lead to systemic toxicity in mice
with selective IFNγ R expression on endothelial cells, as observed in wild-type mice, which
is compatible with the observation that IFNγ, unlike TNF, does not induce necrosis in
combination with bacterial products in the normal skin27. The early events induced by IFNγ
in tumours resemble blood vessel regression in development, wound healing, ovary cycle
and pregnancy-induced uterine vascular remodelling, the latter being regulated by
IFNγ6–8,24,25. In conclusion, IFNγ and TNF, simultaneously produced by effector T cells,

together have a strong effect on tumour blood vessels: (1) TNF bursts the tumour vessels and
allows extravasation of infiltrating cells, and (2) IFNγ helps to prevent relapse by keeping
the tumour in an ischaemic state, similar to that observed when these cytokines are targeted
selectively to the vasculature28.

METHODS
Expression vectors

Author Manuscript

To construct the PIG (pCAGloxPSTOPloxP-IFNγR-IRES-GFP) plasmid, the IRES-GFP
sequence from pMIG29 was excised with HincII. The resulting fragment was ligated into the
blunt-ended KpnI site of pHMGmGIFR30 resulting in pHMG-mIFNγR-IRES-GFP. To
replace the lacZ gene of pCAGloxPSTOPloxPZ31 with the IFNγR-IRES-GFP fragment,
pCAGloxPSTOPloxP-Z was digested with BamHI, treated with Klenow fragment and
thereafter the lacZ gene was excised by digestion with NotI. Next, the IFNγR-IRES-GFP
fragment was excised from pHMG-mIFNγR-IRES-GFP using SmaI and NotI and was
ligated into pCAGloxPSTOPloxP to generate pCAGloxPSTOPloxPIFNγ(R-IRES-GFP.
The retroviral vector plasmid for inducible IFNγ expression, pMOV-IFNγ, has been
previously described19. To obtain pMOV-IFNγ-GFP and pMOV-TNF-GFP, cDNA
sequences encoding for GFP-tagged mIFNγ or mTNF, including a glycine-serine-linker
(G4S)3 that is located between the cytokine and the GFP gene (replacing the cytokine 3′
untranslated region), were de novo synthesized by GeneArt (Regensburg, Germany). The de
novo synthesized sequences (IFNγ–GFP: 1,230 bp, TNF–GFP: 1,470 bp) contained NotI
and SalI sites for ligation into NotI and SalI sites of pMOV.1-T2.

PIG mice were generated by excising the pCAGloxPSTOPloxPIFNγR-IRES-GFP expression
cassette using KpnI and NotI. The 8,891 bp fragment was gel purified and injected into the
pronucleus of fertilized C57BL/6 oocytes. C57BL/6, IFNγR− (strain number 003288),
IFNγ− (strain number 002287), Rag1− (strain number 002216), Rag2− (strain number
008449) (referred to as Rag−) and CMV-Cre mice (strain number 006054) were obtained
from the Jackson laboratories. TCR-I mice32 are transgenic for a T-cell receptor specific for
SV40 large T, epitope I, and were obtained from Jackson laboratories (strain number
005236) and crossed to a Rag− genetic background. FSP-Cre mice33 were provided by E. G.
Neilson (Northwestern University, Feinberg School of Medicine, Chicago) and were
backcrossed for 10 generations to the C57BL/6 genetic background. Lys-Cre mice34
backcrossed to C57BL/6 genetic background (N10) were obtained from S. Fillatreau
(German Centre for Rheumatology Research, Berlin). PDGFB-CreER-IRES-GFP mice35
were backcrossed for 10 generations to the C57BL/6 genetic background. To obtain mice
with cell-type-specific expression of the IFNγR, PIG mice were crossed to the respective
Cre strain (CMV-Cre, Lys-Cre, FSP-Cre, PDGFB-CreER-IRES-GFP) and to IFNγR− mice.
PIGΔIFNγR × PDGFB-CreER-IRES-GFP were further crossed to IFNγ− mice. Mice used in
experiments were heterozygous for the PIG and Cre alleles and homozygous for the IFNγR−
(and IFNγ−) allele. Rosa26-tdRFP mice were generated on the C57BL/6 genetic
background36 and were crossed to PDGFB-CreER-IRES-GFP mice. Irf4− mice37 were

backcrossed for 10 generations to the C57BL/6 genetic background. Irf4WT/− and Irf4− were
obtained by breeding Irf4− male and Irf4 WT/− female mice. Male and female mice aged
between 6–24 weeks were used and matched in experiments. All animal experiments were
conducted in accordance with institutional, state, and federal guidelines and with permission
of the local animal ethics committee of the LAGeSo, Berlin. Effect and sample size
estimates were done and included in animal experiment applications. At any signs of illness
(lethargy, hunched posture, scruffy coat, social isolation, inactivity or weight loss) mice were
taken out of the experiment. All animals used for experiments are reported. No
randomization was performed and the investigators were not blinded to allocation during
experiments and outcome assessment.
Genotyping

Author Manuscript

The PIG transgene was identified by PCR with primers specific for the stop cassette
(chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene) 5′-CAGTCAGTTG CTCAATGTACC-3′ and 5′ACTGGTGAAACTCACCCA-3′ and the GFP gene 5′-AAGTTCATCTGCACCACCG-3′
and 5′-TCCTTGAAGAAGATGGTGCG-3′. The endogenous IFNgr1 gene was detected
with a forward primer specific for exon 4: 5′-ATGCAACGGTTTCCACCCCC-3′, and a
reverse primer in intron 4: 5′-CCAGT CATAGCCGAATAGCC-3′. IFNgr1− gene was
detected with a forward primer specific for exon 4 (as above) and a reverse primer specific
for the neomycin resistance gene 5′-CCACCTCAGCACTGTCTTCA-3′. IFNγ− mice were
genotyped using the primers: oIMR6218 5′-CCTTCTATCGCCTTCTTGACG-3′,
oIMR8284 5′-AGAAGTAAGTGGAAGGGCCCAGAAG-3′ and oIMR8285 5′AGGGAAACTGGGAGAGGAGAAATAT-3′. Rosa26-RFP mice were genotyped by PCR
using primers 5′-AAGACCGCGAAGAGTTTGTCC-3′, 5′TAAGCCTGCCCAGAAGACTCC-3′ and 5′-AAGGGAGCTGCA GTGGAGTA-3′. The
PDGFB-CreER-IRES-GFP transgene was detected using primers 5′GCCGCCGGGATCACTCTCG-3′ and 5′-CCAGCCGCCGTCGC AACTC-3′. All other
Cre-transgenic mice (Lys-Cre, FSP-Cre and CMV-Cre) were genotyped by using the generic
Cre-PCR from the Jackson labs with the primers: oIMR1084 5′GCGGTCTGGCAGTAAAAACTATC-3′ and oIMR1085 5′GTGAAACAGCATTGCTGTCAC TT-3′. The genotypes of Rag− and TCR-I mice were
confirmed by flow cytometry of peripheral blood mononuclear cells staining for T cells and
B cells. The genotype for PIG × CMV-Cre, Lys-Cre, FSP-Cre, PDGFB-CreER-IRES-GFP
was confirmed by flow cytometry assessing GFP. Irf4− mice are unable to generate IgM,
therefore lack of serum IgM (determined by ELISA) classified Irf4− animals.

and 16.113-999IFNγ-IND cells were generated by retroviral transduction with pMOV-IFNγ
by standard procedures19. Cells were cloned by limiting dilution and selected for optimal
IFNγ induction and no expression in the absence of dox. J558L is a BALB/c-derived
plasmacytoma cell line. J558LTNF-GFP-IND and J558LIFNγ-GFP-IND cells were generated by
retroviral transduction of J558L cells with pMOV-IFNγ-GFP or pMOV-TNF-GFP, cloned
and selected as described above. J558LTNF-GFP-IND and J558LIFNγ-GFP-INDcells were

additionally transduced with the retroviral vector pMFG-cerulean22. B16-F10 is a mouse
melanoma cell line isolated from C57BL/6 mice and L929 is a fibrosacroma cell line derived
from a C3H/An mouse. 16.113 is a carcinoma cell line derived from the colon of LoxP-Tag
mice38. 16.113-999 is an IFNγ-insensitive variant of 16.113 cell line39. All cell lines
mentioned above were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium with 10% FCS. Send.1 cells are
polyoma middle T antigen immortalized endothelial cells from blood vessels of the skin.
Send.1 cells were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM) with 20%
FCS. Fibroblasts were generated by cutting tail skin into small pieces and digesting them
overnight in DMEM, 20% FCS containing collagenase II (1 mg ml−1) and dispase (1 mg
ml−1) at 37 °C. Digestion was stopped by changing the medium (DMEM, 10% FCS). To
generate immortalized fibroblasts from PIG mice, primary fibroblast cultures were
transfected with the plasmid pCMV-Tagori40 and with the plasmid pBabe-puro using
Lipofectamine 2000 (Life Technologies), according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
Transfected fibroblasts were selected using 1 (µg ml−1 puromycin. To rule out bacterial
products synergizing with TNF, J558L cells were tested for the presence of mycoplasma by
PCR using the primers: 5′-TGCACCATGTGTCACTCTGTTAACCTC-3′ and 5′GGGAGCAAACAGGATTAGATACCCT-3′. No commonly misidentified cell line was used
in the study. MCA313 are fibrosarcoma, J558L plasmocytoma and 16.113 are carcinoma
cells that were distinguished by morphology in cell culture. No other authentication was
used.
Culture and imaging of HUVECs

Donor-pooled human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs; PromoCell, GmbH) were
cultured in Endothelial Growth Medium 2 (Lonza, Ltd) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions for a maximum of five passages. For immunofluorescence and time lapse
experiments, cells were plated on 18-mm coverslips or in Nunc Laboratory-Tek chambered
coverglass 1.5 (ThermoFisher Scientific, Inc.) coated with 10µg ml−1 bovine plasma
fibronectin (Sigma-Aldrich, Co. Llc., F1141). Cells were treated with recombinant human
IFNγ (PeproTech) every 24 h for a total of 4 days. To stain actin filaments for live cell
experiments, 250 nM SiR-Actin was added to the cells 1 h before the start of the imaging.
For immunofluorescence analysis of HUVECs, cells were fixed and permeabilized for 1 min
with 0.3% glutaraldehyde (EM Grade, Electron Microscopy Sciences), 0.25% Triton X-100
in cytoskeleton buffer (CB: 10 mM MES, pH 6.1, 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM EGTA, 5 mM
glucose, 5 mM MgCl2) followed by a second fixation step with 2% paraformaldehyde
(Electron Microscopy Sciences) in CB for 10 min. The sample was quenched with 0.1%
NaBrH4 for 7 min and washed three times with PBS for 10 min. The sample was incubated
in blocking buffer (3% BSA in PBS) for 1 h and stained overnight with rabbit polyclonal
anti-human VE-cadherin antibody (Abcam, ab33168) in blocking buffer. The sample was
then incubated for 1 h with donkey anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to Alexa Fluor 647 and 250
nM phalloidin conjugated to Alexa Fluor 488 (ThermoFisher Scientific, Inc.). Samples were
mounted in Abberior Mount Solid mounting media (Abberior, GmbH). Imaging of HUVECs
was performed on LSM 780 confocal microscope with Plan Apochromat 63 × NA 1.4 Oil
objective (Carl Zeiss). Time-lapse series with reflection-based autofocus were acquired
using a custom-written Visual Basic macro (A. Politi and J. Ellenberg, EMBL Heidelberg),

2 × 105 MCA313IFNγ-IND, J558LTNF-GFP-IND, J558LIFNγ–GFP-IND or 16.133–999IFNγ-IND
cells per ml were cultured for 48 h without or in the presence of 10, 50, or 100 ng ml−1 dox
(Sigma Aldrich). Culture supernatants were analysed by IFNγ- or TNF-specific ELISA
according to the manufacturer’s (OptEIA; BD Biosciences) recommendation. TNF
biological activity of the TNF–GFP fusion protein was analysed by an L929 cytotoxicity
assay. L929 cells were seeded at 3.5 × 104 cells in 96 wells in RPMI, 2% FCS and cultured
overnight. Then, 2 µg ml−1 actinomycin D (Sigma Aldrich) and recombinant TNF
(Peprotech) or TNF-GFP in concentrations as indicated were added in fresh medium (RPMI,
2% FCS) and incubated for 24 h. Thereafter, fresh XTT (sodium,2,3,-bis(2-methoxy-4nitro-5-sulfophenyl)-5-[(phenylamino)-carbonyl]-2H-tetrazolium) solution was added,
incubated for 4 h, and absorbance was measured at 450 nm. For each concentration, three
replicates were tested per plate. To evaluate the bioactivity of the IFNγ–GFP fusion protein,
106 B16-F10 cells were cultured in 5 ml RPMI 1640 medium 10% FCS containing either
recombinant IFNγ or IFNγ–GFP at a concentration of 1 ng ml−1. After 48 h, MHC-I
upregulation was analysed by flow cytometry. Blood samples were collected from the facial
vein using a sterile lancet. Blood was allowed to agglutinate and then centrifuged for 20 min
at 4°C. Serum samples were aliquoted and stored at −80 °C. To determine serum IFNγ
levels, 20 µl of 1:5 diluted serum was analysed using the cytometric bead array from
eBioscience (Procartaplex) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
Tumour experiments

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

106 MCA313IFNγ-IND cells, 16.113–999IFNγ-IND, J558LTNF-GFP-IND or J558LIFNγ–GFP-IND
cells were injected subcutaneously into the right flank of the mice. Tumours were measured
2–3 times weekly in three perpendicular diameters using a calliper, and tumour volume was
calculated using the ellipsoid volume formula (π /6 × a × b × c). According to the animal
application approved by the local ethics committee (LAGeSo Berlin), animals were taken
out of the experiment, if tumours reached an average diameter of 1.5–2 cm. In none of the
experiments, a tumour reached a larger size. Mice with tumour necrosis were observed daily
and monitored for humane endpoint criteria (lethargy, hunched posture, scruffy coat, social
isolation, inactivity or weight loss), and these exclusion criteria were not detected in any
case. Dox was continuously administered by adding 1 mg ml−1 dox to light-protected
drinking water (supplemented with 20 mg ml−1 glucose). Tamoxifen was administered in
chow at 400 mg kg−1 (TAM400, LASvendi) three days before tumour cell transplantation as
indicated. Before mice were exposed to tamoxifen chow, they were administered for 10 days
soy-free chow from LASvendi to exclude effects from phytoestrogens.
In experiments described in Fig. 1f and Extended Data Fig. 1a (left panel), dox was
administered in 48 h intervals (48 h on dox, 48 h on water). In intravital imaging
experiments, dox was administered by daily bolus injection of 10µg i.p. For adoptive T-cell
therapy, 106 16.113 cells were subcutaneously injected into Rag− mice. When tumours were
established (approximately 500 mm3), mice received 107 TCR-I T cells from Rag− × TCR-I

mice i.v. per animal at the indicated time point. In the experiment described in the Extended
Data Fig. 1h, T cells from C57Bl/6 or IFNγ− mice were transduced with a retroviral vector
to express the TCR-I T cell receptor. Five days after ATT with 106 TCR-I-transduced T
cells, tumours were isolated and after tissue digestion the number of endothelial cells was
analysed by flow cytometry.
For experiments in Extended Data Fig. 3d, Rag− mice or Rag−IFNγR− mice were
reconstituted with 2 × 107 splenocytes from wild-type mice. Two weeks after T-cell transfer,
106 MCA313IFNγ-IND cells were injected and when tumours were established (846 ± 263
mm3), IFNγ was induced. Five days after IFNγ induction, tumours were isolated and, after
tissue digestion, endothelial cells (CD31 and CD146 double positive cells) from 107 tumour
cells were analysed by flow cytometry.

Author Manuscript

Potential immunogenicity of transgenes used in this study was excluded by experiments
showing that MCA313IFNγ-IND tumours grew and regressed after IFNγ induction with the
same kinetics in wild-type and Rag− mice (Extended Data Fig. 1a) and, furthermore, cells
expressing the rtTA protein were not eliminated even after 100 days in fully
immunocompetent mice (Extended Data Fig. 5f). Scale bars for tumour pictures were
inserted based on the calliper measurements of the day the picture was taken.
Wound healing experiments

Author Manuscript

106 MCA313IFNγ-IND cells were injected subcutaneously into the right flank of indicated
mice. After one week (tumour size approximately 50 mm3), mice were anaesthetized, and a
wound of 5 mm in diameter was made on the back of the mice using a biopsy punch. For the
first 48 h, analgesia was administered. Mice were inspected every day. The wound healing
process was recorded by taking photos and by measuring the diameter of the wound in two
perpendicular axes using a calliper.
Gene expression analysis

Author Manuscript

Tumour endothelial cells (CD31+CD146+) were isolated by fluorescence-activated cell
sorting into RNAzol. cDNA was synthesized from ~ 500 pg total RNA according to the
standard Affymetrix protocol GeneChip WT Pico Kit (P/N 902623) by using the Affymetrix
T7 RNA polymerase promoter which is attached to random primers. Pre-IVT was performed
with 12 amplification cycles. Then, ss-cDNA was fragmented and biotin-labelled according
to Affymetrix recommendations. Fragmented cDNA (3.8 µg) was hybridized to MOGENE
2.0 ST arrays. Arrays were washed and stained in the Affymetrix Fluidics Station 450 and
further scanned using the Affymetrix GeneChip Scanner 3000 7G. Software: Affymetrix
GeneChip Command Console Version 4.0. The image data were normalized and quality
controlled with the Affymetrix Expression Console Software Version 1.4. The microarray
data were deposited in the GEO data repository under the accession number GSE94504.
The bioinformatics analysis of the gene expression data was carried out with R
BioConductor, to quantify the gene expression changes and normalize array intensity values
for the comparison between the samples we used ‘rma’ function from ‘oligo’ package (target
= ‘probeset’ parameter was used). Manufacture’s probe identifiers were converted to mouse
gene names with ‘mogene20stprobeset.db annotation. After background subtraction and

log fold changes are computed from the average across replicates. For MCA313IFNγ-IND
data from 24 h and 48 h after induction were so consistent that they could be regarded as
replicates (data not shown). Differential expression analysis was carried out with limma’
package by computing moderated t-statistics and Benjamini–Hochberg adjusted P values.
Number of replicates analysed were: MCA313IFNγ-IND, 0 h, n = 3; MCA313IFNγ-IND, 24 h,
n = 2; MCA313IFNγ-IND, 48 h, n = 2; J558LIFNγ–GFP-IND, 0 h, n = 3; J558LIFNγ–GFP-IND,

Longitudinal imaging using window chambers

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

The procedures for surgical implantation of window chambers and longitudinal imaging are
detailed elsewhere22. In brief, window chambers were implanted into mice, and mice were
injected with 106 cancer cells. 13–18 days later, dox administration was started and
continued throughout the experiment. For microscopic analysis, mice with window
chambers were anaesthetized using isofluorane. The window was fastened to the main stage
of the microscope using a custom-made holder. The microscope (Leica SP5 II TCS Tandem
scanner 2-photon spectral confocal with 4 × and 20 × 0.45 LWD IR objectives from
Olympus) has a heated chamber for maintaining body temperature. The software and x–y
motorized stage allow returning to memorized positions within the window at later times.
For visualization of the tumour vasculature and blood flow, mice were injected with 1,1dioctadecyl-3,3,3, 3-tetramethylindodicarbocyanine perchlorate (DiD)-labelled red blood
cells. In brief, red blood cells were obtained from the peripheral blood of Rag− mice and
labelled with DiD (Invitrogen) for 30 min at 37°C. After three washes with PBS, DiDlabelled red blood cells were injected intravenously. Absorption and fluorescence emission
maxima of DiD are 644 nm and 665 nm, respectively. The optical penetration of tissue
typically ranged between 100–150 µm. The acquired images were analysed using Fiji41.
Intravital two-photon microscopy
24 h before imaging procedure, 10 µg dox was injected i.p. in 100 µl PBS. In vivo
multiphoton microscopy (IVMPM) of J558LIFNγ-GFP-IND tumours engrafted in Rag− mice
was performed while mice were anaesthetized with isoflurane. For IVMPM, an Ultima
Multiphoton Microscopy System was used (Prairie Technologies). For imaging GFP, the
excitation wavelength was set to l = 890 nm. Band-pass filters optimized for GFP (BP l =
525/50 nm) were used for detection. Collected single plane images were assembled to a 3D
stack for each tumour in silico using Amira 3D software.

Flow cytometry

Author Manuscript

To analyse peripheral blood mononuclear cells, blood was taken from the facial vein using a
sterile lancet. Erythrocytes were lysed using ACK lysis buffer (BD Biosciences). To exclude
dead cells from analysis, 7-AAD or the fixable viability dye eFluor 450 were used. For
staining of tumour stroma cells, tumours were isolated, cut into small pieces and digested for
1 h in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10 mg ml−1 collagenase II, 10 mg ml−1 dispase and
10 µg ml−1 DNase I. Cells were washed in PBS and filtered over a 40 µm nylon mesh. Fcreceptors were blocked with anti-CD16/32 blocking antibodies. To analyse tumour
endothelial cells, we used an integrated magnetic enrichment, using anti-PE magnetic
microbeads that were added to the sample of PE-positive cells (stained with CD31-PE-Cy7/
CD146-PE) and were directly enriched before FACS analysis, as suggested for analysis of

material were stained with CD45.2, CD31, CD146 and live/dead cell exclusion. For IFNγR
(CD119) staining, a biotin-labelled anti-CD119 (2E2) antibody in combination with
streptavidin-APC was used, the signal was subsequently enhanced by amplification using
the FASER Kit-APC (Miltenyi Biotec) using streptavidin-anti-APC antibodies. Control
staining was done without the primary antibody. For intracellular staining of IRF4, anti-IRF4
monoclonal antibody (Biolegend 646408) and the transcription factor staining kit

For isolating macrophages, tumours were cut into small pieces and digested as described
above. Cells were washed in PBS and filtered over a 40 µm nylon mesh and labelled with
anti-mouse CD11b MACS beads (Miltenyi Biotec). CD11b cells were purified by magnetic
cell sorting (purity was > 90%). 4 × 105 CD11b cells were seeded in 12-well tissue culture
plates. Cells were stimulated with 250 U ml−1 IFNγ for 24 h. The nitrite ion was measured
in a Griess diazotization reaction using Griess reagent system (Promega) according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. In brief, 50 µl of medium was mixed with 50 µl of sulfanilamid
solution and incubated for 10 min protected from light. Next, Griess reagent (N-(1naphthyl)ethylenediamine) was added and incubated for another 10 min protected from
light. Thereafter, absorbance was measured at 540 nm. Nitric oxide concentration was
determined using the optical density value from the Nitric oxide standard curve and medium
without standard (blank) was set as detection limit.

Tumour tissues were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (Sigma Aldrich) containing 10% m/w
sucrose overnight, incubated overnight in PBS-sucrose solution (25% m/w) and embedded
in OCT-tissue tech (Sakura). 5 µm sections were mounted on slides. Slides were treated with
0.2% galantine (Sigma Aldrich) and 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS and additionally blocked
with antibody diluent (Dako) for 1 h at room temperature. All antibody staining were
performed in Dako antibody diluent solution. Primary antibodies were incubated overnight
at 4 °C. After three washes with PBS, secondary antibodies were added for 1 h together with
Hoechst 33342 (Sigma Aldrich) at room temperature. Negative controls were generated by
staining with the secondary antibodies and Hoechst 33342 only. After staining, the slides
were covered with slowfade (Life Technologies) and analysed with ObserverD.1 or LSM710
confocal microscopes (Zeiss). Haematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining was performed on 5µm paraffin-embedded tissue sections. After deparaffinization and rehydration, sections
were stained with haematoxylin (Gill no. 2) and eosin, covered with histomout and
examined under an OberserverD.1 microscope with Zen software. For evaluation of
erythrocytes, eosin fluorescence signals were captured and at least 60 high magnification
fields from 3–4 tumours were analysed for each experimental group. Analysis was
performed using ZEN software (Zeiss), ImageJ (version 1.49) or Imaris.
For VE-cadherin staining of tumour vasculature, tissue sections were fixed using 2%
paraformaldehyde in PBS for 15 min at room temperature followed by three washes for 5

rinsing in PBS and one wash for 5 min with PBS. Blocking solution (PBS containing 10%
goat serum and 2.5% mouse serum; Sigma) was used for 1 h at room temperature before
staining procedure was started using anti-CD31 and anti-VE-cadherin (eBioscience
14-1441-82) diluted 1:50 in blocking solution incubated on tissue sections over night at 4 °C
in a wet chamber. Secondary antibodies diluted 1:100 in blocking solution containing
Hoechst 33342 were incubated for 2–3 h at room temperature. Mowiol was used as
mounting medium after three finalizing washing steps with PBS for 5 min at room
temperature.
Statistics

Author Manuscript

No statistical methods were used to predetermine sample size. To estimate the effect size for
those experiments not involving animals and presented in the paper, one pilot experiment
was performed. Then, usually a second experiment powered on what was observed in the
pilot experiment was performed to attain significance and to test reproducibility. Data
generally met the assumptions of the tests performed. The variance was in general similar
between the groups that were being statistically compared and data met the assumptions of
the tests. Statistical analysis was performed with GraphPad Prism 5.0. When comparing two
groups, if not indicated otherwise, we used the two-tailed Mann-Whitney U-test. When
comparing more than two groups, we used the one-way ANOVA. P values less than 0.05
were considered as significant, *P < 0.05, ** P < 0.01 and ***P < 0.001.

a, Experimental system consisting of IFNγR− cancer cells, MCA313, with dox-inducible
IFNγ expression (MCA313IFNγ-IND) and transgenic mice with inducible IFNγR expression
in defined cell types (PIG mice: Cre/LoxP-excision of stop-cassette allows CAG-promoterdriven expression of IFNγ R and GFP on an IFNγR− genetic background). b, Doxdependent IFNγ expression by MCA313IFNγ-IND cells in vitro (ELISA, mean and s.d. of
three experiments). c, Similar IFNγ serum peak levels produced by MCA313IFNγ-IND (but
not MCA313, triangles) tumours (peak day 2 after dox, tumours 790 ± 260 mm3, filled
circles) and CD8+ T cells during rejection of 16.113 tumours (peak day 4 after adoptive Tcell therapy (ATT), tumours 584 ± 153 mm3, filled squares), mean ± s.e.m. d-f, Dox-induced
IFNγ expression in MCA313IFNγ-IND tumours of PIGCMV-Cre mice leads to necrosis (d; n =
2). e, f, Blood vessel reduction (n = 2) within 120 h (e) and tumour regression after dox
application at a tumour size of 613 ± 467 mm3 (f). Combined data of two experiments. g-i,
No effect as in d-f in control PIGΔIFNγR mice. Scale bars, 0.5 cm (d, g). i, Dox at a tumour
size of 562 ± 65 mm3. Combined data of two experiments. The number of mice, replications
and sample size for each experiment are shown in Supplementary Table 3.

a-f, Following IFNγ induction in MCA313IFNγ-IND tumours of PIGLys-Cre (a-c) and
PIGFSP-Cre (d-f) mice, no necrosis, changes in blood vessel density (120 h after dox) or
tumour regression was observed. c, f, Dox at a tumour size of 616 ± 183 mm3 and 599 ± 175
mm3, respectively. Combined data of two experiments. g-j, To induce CreER-mediated
recombination in endothelial cells, PIGPDGFB-Cre-ΔIFNγ mice received tamoxifen. g, h,
Necrosis (g) and reduction (h) in blood vessels 120 h after IFNγ induction. i, Tumour
growth is delayed after IFNγ induction (right panel) in MCA313IFNγ-IND tumours (519 ± 30

day 21, tumour size differs significantly (**). j, Flow cytometry of tumour endothelial cells
(CD31+CD146+) of tumours depicted in i, shows that most endothelial cells in untreated
tumours (approximately day 20) are GFP+, while most endothelial cells are GFP− in tumours
after 48 ± 5 days IFNγ exposure. k, 107 tumour cells of indicated mice without (open bars)
and 120 h after IFNγ induction (black bars), were analysed for CD31+CD146+ cells using
flow cytometry. Scale bars, 0.5 cm (a, d, g). Data are mean ± s.d., **P <0.01 and ***P <
0.001. The number of mice, replications and sample size for each experiment are shown in
Supplementary Table 3.

a, IFNγ–GFP induction in cerulean+ J558LIFNγ–GFP-IND cells 48 h after dox, analysed for
IFNγ (ELISA, left y axis and open bars) and GFP (flow cytometry, right y axis and black
bars). Mean ± s.d. of three experiments. b, Upregulation of MHC-I on B16-F10 cells by
IFNγ–GFP is comparable to recombinant IFNγ. Cells cultured with (black line) or without
(dotted line) 1 ng ml−1 IFNγ (left panel) or IFNγ–GFP (right panel), were analysed for
H-2Kb/H-2Db expression (representative of two experiments). c, The same area of
J558LIFNγ–GFP-IND tumours established for 12–14 days behind a glass window in Rag−
mice was repeatedly imaged over several days following dox. Shown: cancer cell viability
(cerulean+, 1st row), IFNγ–GFP expression (2nd row), vascular density (bright field, 3rd
row) and blood flow (DiD-stained erythrocytes, 4th row) (see also Extended Data Fig. 6,
Supplementary Video 3). d, Quantification of changes in J558LIFNγ–GFP-IND tumour signal
and blood vessel area over time. e, TNF-GFP induction in cerulean+ J558LTNF-GFP-IND cells
