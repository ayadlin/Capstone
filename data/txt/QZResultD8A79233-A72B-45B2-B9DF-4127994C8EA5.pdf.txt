Abstract
Members of the 90-kDa heat shock protein (HSP90) family are
known to bind and stabilize intermediates in a wide variety of
cell signaling pathways and contribute to their dysregulation
in cancer. An important intracellular cofactor for HSP90 is
Cdc37, a protein with a broad role in fostering the activities of
protein kinases. By targeting Cdc37 using RNA interference,
we have shown that the loss of Cdc37 function induces
irreversible growth arrest in androgen receptor-positive and
-negative prostate carcinoma cells. In contrast to HSP90directed agents, Cdc37 targeting seems to affect cancer cells
through a distinct mechanism and does not significantly
deplete the intracellular levels of most known HSP90 client
proteins. Instead, Cdc37 depletion inhibits cellular kinase
activity and flux through growth-promoting signal transduction cascades. We show that the loss of Cdc37 leads to reduced
activity of the Erk, Akt, mTOR, and androgen-induced pathways. We have also discovered synergistic interactions
between Cdc37 inactivation and the HSP90-inhibitory anticancer drug 17-(allylamino)-17-demethoxygeldanamycin
(17AAG). These interactions involve enhanced degradation
of proteins essential for growth and inhibition of 17AAGinduced expression of the antiapoptotic HSP70. Thus, Cdc37
is essential for maintaining prostate tumor cell growth and
may represent a novel target in the search for multitargeted
therapies based on the HSP90 chaperone system. [Cancer Res

Introduction
The heat shock proteins (HSP) are the products of a diverse
family of genes whose main function is to fold polypeptides into
functional configurations (1). These proteins, characterized by such
molecular chaperone activity, are highly conserved throughout
evolution (2). Although many HSPs are induced primarily during
cell stress, a number are ubiquitously expressed in all cell types.
Among these is HSP90, which represents 1% to 2% of total cellular
protein and is found in complexes with numerous protein cofactors
or co-chaperones (3).
One important HSP90 co-chaperone whose functions are just
now being described is Cdc37. First identified in yeast as a cell
cycle protein, recent studies indicate a role for Cdc37 in targeting

protein kinases to the HSP90 complex (4). Thus, in normal tissues,
Cdc37 interacts with newly translated protein kinases, promoting
their maturation and recruitment to HSP90 complexes. However,
when Cdc37 is overexpressed, novel or cryptic properties emerge,
and the protein can perform a number of additional functions both
in concert with and independently of HSP90 (5). Analysis of clinical
samples has shown abundant expression of Cdc37 in prostate
carcinoma compared with relatively low levels in normal prostatic
epithelium (6). Indeed, Cdc37 overexpression is sufficient to induce
prostatic dysplasia in mice (6). This attribute is unique among the
HSP90 co-chaperones and may be related to the fact that Cdc37 is
the only such molecule to play an essential role in cell cycle
regulation (7). At the molecular level, Cdc37 binds to a conserved
motif located within the catalytic domains of a large number of
protein kinases including molecules whose functions are commonly dysregulated in cancer, such as the Raf-1, Akt, Aurora B,
epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and platelet-derived
growth factor receptor kinases (8–12). Although the repertoire
of Cdc37 clients is largely restricted to protein kinases, one
exception exists, which is of considerable relevance to prostate
cancer: its activating function in androgen receptor signaling
(13). Of further consequence for the biology of malignant cells,
many Cdc37 binding partners are key signaling pathway intermediates that become activated in cancer by changes such as
mutation, overexpression, and overactivation; although these
changes render such proteins prone to aggregation, the elevated
levels of Cdc37 in cancer cells may serve to chaperone the unstable
states of these clients and maintain them in an active form that
permits a role in mediating the autonomous growth characteristic
of many cancers (14).
The current strategy of targeting the HSP90 chaperone system
for cancer treatment is attractive in permitting simultaneous
inhibition of multiple oncoproteins without the accumulating
toxicity of using multiple therapies. Numerous HSP90 inhibitors
have been developed, including the ansamycins, that specifically
inhibit the intrinsic ATPase activity of HSP90 (15). Effective
ansamycin derivatives have been isolated, including 17-(allylamino)-17-demethoxygeldanamycin (17AAG) that has recently
completed several phase I clinical trials (16–23) and is now
undergoing evaluation in phase II. Initial results are encouraging,
although problems were noted with formulation and hepatotoxicity. Although the strengths of HSP90 inhibitors in cancer therapy
include their versatility in inhibiting a wide range of oncogenic
pathways, these qualities may also contribute to some complications of treatment because HSP90 is essential for a range of
indispensable functions in normal tissues. Targeting Cdc37
represents a potential alternative to direct HSP90 inhibition that
may offer greater specificity (due to its elevated expression in
cancer) and an improved side effect profile. Additionally, Cdc37
may be an attractive target in tumor types such as androgenindependent prostate cancer that currently lack highly effective
therapies.

Cdc37 Targeting in Prostate Cancer

In this study, we have examined the role of Cdc37 in the growth
of human prostate cancer cells. We show that depletion of Cdc37
using RNA interference leads to irreversible growth arrest in a
range of AR and AR+ prostate cancer cells and sensitizes them to
treatment with HSP90 inhibitors. Growth inhibition after Cdc37
depletion seems to involve the inhibition of growth-dependent
protein kinase activity. In AR+ cells, however, Cdc37 depletion also
leads to the loss of AR transcriptional activity, and Cdc37 targeting
may exert a proportion of its effects through ablation of androgendependent gene expression. Our studies further indicate that Cdc37
plays a qualitatively different role in prostate cancer growth compared with that of HSP90, fostering kinase activity rather than
protecting client proteins from proteolysis. When we combined the
targeting of Cdc37 and HSP90, we observed strong additive cytotoxicity, evidence for their contrasting mechanisms in cell regulation and suggestive of potential joint uses in cancer treatment.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture. LNCaP, Du145, and PC3 cells were obtained from the
American Type Culture Collection. LNCaP-HP was developed in-house by
repeated passage of LNCaP cells until they developed the ability to grow in
low androgen conditions. Du145 and PC3 cells were cultured in DMEM
(Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and penicillin/
streptomycin cocktail. LNCaP and LNCaP-HP were grown similarly but in
RPMI 1640 (Invitrogen). Cells were grown in a humidified incubator
maintained at 37jC with 5% CO2. Each of these malignant prostate
carcinoma cell lines showed increased levels of Cdc37 expression compared
with normal prostatic epithelium (Supplemental Fig. S1).
Virus production and transduction. Cdc37 small hairpin RNA (shRNA)
and control plasmids were purchased from Open Biosystems. All pLKO.1
plasmids were developed by the RNAi consortium. Packaging and envelope
plasmids were obtained from Addgene. To produce virus, pLKO.1 plasmids,
the packaging plasmid psPAX2, and the envelope plasmid pCMV-VSVg were
simultaneously transfected into 293FT cells (Invitrogen). Eighteen hours
after transfection, cells were re-fed DMEM + 30% fetal bovine serum. Virus
containing media was subsequently removed in two aliquots at 24 and
48 h and frozen at 80jC.
Virus transduction was completed by adding the appropriate amount of
virus-containing media and 8 Ag/mL hexadimethrine bromide to growth
media containing nonattached cells. Upon completion of transduction and
attachment 24 h later, virus-containing media was removed and replaced
with fresh media containing 2.5 Ag/mL puromycin. Transduced cells were
selected for at least 2 days before use. Transduction efficiencies typically
exceeded 95% in most cell types. The following TRC designated plasmids
were tested: TRCN0000116632 (5¶-CCGGGCCCATTCAAGTCTCTGCTTTCTCGAGAAAGCAGAGACTTGAATGGGCTTTTTG-3¶), TRCN0000116633
(5¶-CCGGCGGCAGTTCTTCACTAAGATTCTCGAGAATCTTAGTGAAGAACTGCCGTTTTTG-3¶), TRCN0000116634 (5¶-CCGGCCGGCAGTTCTTCACTAAGATCTCGAGATCTTAGTGAAGAACTGCCGGTTTTTG-3¶),
TRCN0000116635 (5¶-CCGGCCAGACAATCGTCATGCAATTCTCGAGAATTGCATGACGATTGTCTGGTTTTTG-3¶), and TRCN0000116636 (5¶-CCGGGACAGCCAATTACCTGGTCATCTCGAGATGACCAGGTAATTGGCTGTCTTTTTG-3¶). It was determined that TRCN0000116633 did consistently better
than the other clones in repeated experiments in all cells tested and is
heretofore referred to simply as ‘‘Cdc37 shRNA’’.
Antibodies and reagents. 17AAG was obtained from Assay Designs.
Puromycin and RNase A were obtained from Sigma Aldrich. Normal
prostate lysate was obtained from ProSci. The following antibodies
were purchased from Cell Signaling Technologies: Akt, phospho-Akt
(Ser473), Aurora B, phospho-Gsk3h (Ser9), Gsk3h, phospho-p90RSK (Ser380),
p90RSK, phospho-p42/44 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK;
Thr202/Tyr204), p42/44 MAPK, phospho-S6 ribosomal protein (Ser235/236),
and S6 ribosomal protein. Antibodies to Raf-1 and h-actin were purchased
from Sigma Aldrich. Anti-Cdc37 was purchased from Abcam. Horseradish

www.aacrjournals.org

peroxidase (HRP)–conjugated secondary antibodies were purchased from
Invitrogen. Pan-HSP70 antibody was created in-house as previously
described (24).
Cell counting and colony formation assays. For cell counting assays,
200,000 cells were plated in 10-cm dishes in triplicate and grown as
described for the indicated time periods. Cells were trypsinized and
counted thrice per data point on a hemocytometer excluding dead cells
with trypan blue (total of nine counts per time point). For colony assays, an
appropriate amount of cells were plated in six-well plates (each data point
in triplicate) and grown as described for 9 to 14 days until visible colonies
were seen. Cells were then fixed in cold methanol, stained with 1% crystal
violet, and washed in dH2O. Colonies containing >50 cells were then scored
by a blinded observer.
3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assays
and data analysis. Four thousand to 6,000 Cdc37-knockdown and control
cells were plated in triplicate into 96-well plates containing serial dilutions of
the drug. Cells were incubated for 4 days, after which Cell-Titer 96 Aqueous One
solution (Promega) was added per manufacturer’s instructions. Absorbance
was read on a plate reader, background was subtracted, and survival was set
relative to wells containing no drug. Sigmoid curves were fitted to collected
data using SigmaPlot X (Systat). Statistical analysis was also conducted using
SigmaPlot.
Cell transfection and reporter assays. All cells were transfected using
Fugene-HD reagent (Roche) per manufacturer’s instructions. The HSP70Bluc reporter has been previously described (25). The ARE-luc reporter has
also been previously described (26). HSP70B-luc/ARE-luc and pCMV-h-Gal
were co-transfected into cells 24 h before treatment. Upon assay
completion, cells were harvested and lysed in 1 reporter lysis buffer
(Promega) and then assayed with Promega’s luciferase or h-Gal assay kits
per manufacturer’s instructions.
Real-time reverse transcription-PCR. Total RNA from cultured cell
lines was isolated from cells using the RNeasy purification kit (Qiagen).
Normal prostate RNA was purchased from Clontech. Reverse transcription
was done on 1 Ag of RNA using iScript (Bio-Rad). Primers used for Cdc37
were forward: 5¶-GGGAGCAGAAAGACAAGACC-3¶, reverse: 5¶-GTGGACGTTGTCTGACAGGT-3¶ and, for h-actin, were forward: 5¶-AAAAGCCACCCCACTTCTCT-3¶, reverse: 5¶-CTCAAGTTGGGGGACAAAAA-3¶. Real-time PCR
was done in triplicate using an ABI 7300 (Applied Biosystems) and iQ SYBR
green master mix (Bio-Rad). Data was directly analyzed with ABI provided
software using the ddCT method. Relative Cdc37 levels were normalized to
h-actin levels.
Western blot analysis. Protein from harvested cells was lysed in
1 radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer (Boston Bioproducts) supplemented with 1 protease cocktail (Roche). Protein sample concentration
was determined using the detergent-compatible protein assay (Bio-Rad).
Twenty to 60 Ag of protein was prepared in 1 SDS-PAGE sample buffer
and run on a 4% to 12% polyacrylamide gel (Boston Bioproducts). Gels
were transferred to Immobilon-P polyvinylidene difluoride membranes
(Millipore) using a Bio-Rad wet transfer apparatus. Membranes were
blocked in 5% nonfat milk or bovine serum albumin for 1 h and then probed
with various antibodies according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies were visualized using enhanced
chemiluminescence (ECL) reagents (Boston Bioproducts) and X-ray film.
Quantitation was done using ImageJ software (27) and graphed using
Microsoft Excel 2007.

Results
Cdc37 is overexpressed in prostate cancer cell lines and is
necessary for proliferation. We aimed to examine the role of
Cdc37 in growth and survival of prostate carcinoma cells using
RNA interference to deplete intracellular concentrations. Figure 1A
shows the effectiveness of a range of shRNAs in reducing Cdc37
in cells expressing either low (HeLa) or high (Du145) Cdc37 concentrations. A number of these constructs proved effective, and
we selected one (116633, see Materials and Methods) that was
packaged into lentiviral vectors and used to infect a number of

harvesting and assay of Cdc37 levels by immunoblot. Each Cdc37 shRNA-bearing virus reduced Cdc37 levels compared with control shRNA viruses with clone number
116633 showing the greatest depletion of Cdc37 in repeated experiments. B, effects of Cdc37 depletion by RNA interference on prostate cancer cell growth.
Du145 (circles ) and PC3 cells (triangles ) were transduced with Cdc37 shRNA virus116633 (closed shapes ) or control virus (open shapes ) and selected with puromycin
for 7 d. Two hundred thousand cells were then plated in 10-cm dishes in triplicate (day 0), and a fraction were harvested and counted by trypan dye exclusion at each
indicated time point. Points, means; bars, SD. C, Western blot analysis of protein levels in cells transduced with Cdc37 shRNA virus (day 0) and selected with

immunoblot. All experiments in this study were done at least twice with reproducible findings.

prostate carcinoma cell lines. Infection with shRNA-containing
lentivirus inhibited the growth of PC3 and Du145 cells, whereas
a control virus containing a scrambled sequence was ineffective
(Fig. 1B). Cdc37 levels in the shRNA-treated cells are subsequently
indicated in Fig. 1C (top) and show a progressive decline to
essentially undetectable levels by day 6. Total growth inhibition was
also observed in the androgen-dependent LNCaP cell line after
Cdc37 depletion. Infection of LNCaP cells with shRNA targeting
Cdc37 virus led to a complete loss of ability to form colonies in our
colony growth assays (data not shown).
Cdc37 knockdown inhibits multiple signaling pathways. We
next investigated molecular changes ensuing from Cdc37 depletion
that could potentially mediate the growth inhibition shown in
Fig. 1B. One of the mechanisms by which HSP90 inhibitors reduce
cancer cell growth is by triggering degradation of HSP90 client
proteins, many of which are arrayed along key growth-promoting
and antiapoptotic pathways (28). We therefore examined levels of
some HSP90/Cdc37 client proteins after Cdc37 depletion. However,
in contrast to the known effects of HSP90 inhibition, Cdc37
depletion did not markedly reduce the levels of the majority of
these proteins as judged by the immunoblot assay (Fig. 1C). The
levels of the protein kinases EGFR, Raf-1, Akt, Aurora B, and cell
division kinase 4 (CDK4), which are almost completely depleted by
growth-inhibitory concentrations of HSP90 drugs, were not
markedly affected over the 6-day course of the experiment.
(Exceptions were a small reduction in Aurora B levels seen in
PC3 cells and a marginal reduction in EGFR levels in both lines).

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (24). December 15, 2007

It is quite striking that after 6 days of shRNA expression, when
Cdc37 is essentially undetectable, these HSP90 client proteins are
still present (Fig. 1C). Similar experiments with control virus
showed no change in Cdc37 levels or client levels (data not shown).
Because Cdc37 depletion only marginally affects the concentrations of its client proteins, we next asked whether cell growth
inhibition might result from inhibition of the enzymatic activities
of these protein kinases rather than their destabilization and
destruction. We therefore examined whether Cdc37 targeting
inhibits flux through mitogen-induced protein kinase cascades
that regulate prostate cancer growth. To examine multiple
intermediates in network signaling, we used antibodies that detect
phosphorylation at regulatory sites on such kinases rather than
enzymatic activity itself. Such phosphorylation is, in most cases,
directly correlated with activity. We examined protein kinases and
their substrates that are intermediates in two main pathways of
mitogenic signaling, including the Erk/MAPK pathway (Erk itself,
p90-RSK, S6) and the Akt pathway (Akt itself and S6). Cdc37
knockdown and control cells (Du145 and PC3) were serum starved
overnight and then briefly incubated in medium containing either
30% serum (mitogenic stimulation) or serum-free controls for
10 min before being harvested, lysed, and assayed by Western blot
for multiple phospho-proteins (Fig. 2A and B). In Du145 cells, with
a characteristically active Erk/MAPK pathway, Cdc37 depletion
inhibited serum-induced phosphorylation of p42/44 MAPK as well
as the downstream effector kinase p90RSK while not markedly
affecting the levels of P42/44MAPK or RSK. In PTEN null PC3 cells,

Cdc37 Targeting in Prostate Cancer

in which enhanced Akt activity plays a major role in growth, Cdc37
depletion eliminated basal phosphorylation of Akt as well as
serum-induced phosphorylation. These effects were also apparently
fed down through the mTOR pathway as indicated by reduced
basal and serum-stimulated phosphorylation of the S6 ribosomal
protein. There also seems to be constitutive phosphorylation of
p90RSK in PC3 cells, and these levels were also reduced by Cdc37
inhibition. Thus, although Cdc37 targeting does not markedly alter
the levels of HSP90 clients, it does inhibit flux through key kinase
cascades presumably through the loss of the chaperoning power
of Cdc37 and prevention of complete kinase maturation. Of
interesting note is the fact that the addition of growth factors
seems to moderately increase the detectable levels of Cdc37 in the
control cells, although the exact mechanism behind this is not
entirely clear and is currently under investigation.
To further investigate the role of Cdc37 in intracellular signal
transduction, we examined the phosphorylation state of inter-

mediates along the Akt pathway after mitogenic stimulation with
epidermal growth factor (EGF). PC3 cells were serum starved
overnight and then incubated with 25 ng/mL recombinant EGF
(Fig. 2C and D). Control cells exposed to EGF showed rapid flux
through the Akt pathway, whereas cells depleted of Cdc37 exhibited
a blunted response to EGF, with only a brief spike of Akt phosphorylation, which was quickly dissipated. These effects of Cdc37
inactivation seemed to be amplified downstream in the kinase
cascade as evidenced by drastically reduced levels of phosphoGSK3, a direct target of Akt, and phospho-S6, a downstream target
of the mTOR pathway. It should also be noted that in both these
experiments, serum deprivation seemed to induce minor but
apparent decreases in several kinases in Cdc37-depleted cells not
observed in cells growing in full medium.
Our experiments indicate that Cdc37 inhibition has a profound
effect on signal transduction propagated through protein phosphorylation cascades. We have concentrated in these experiments

probed sequentially with antibodies to Cdc37, p90RSK, phospho–S380-p90RSK, Akt, phospho–S-473-Akt, p42/44MAPK, phospho–T202/Y204-p42/44, S6, and

on mitogenic signaling, although it is anticipated that protein
kinases involved in other aspects of cell regulation such as cell
cycle progression and other processes will also be affected by
Cdc37 loss.
Cdc37 also inhibits androgen signaling in androgenresponsive prostate cancer cells. Androgen receptor-positive
LNCaP cells are dependent on many of the signaling pathways that
we show above are blunted by Cdc37 depletion in other cell lines
(Fig. 2); such effects are therefore likely to contribute to decreased
growth after Cdc37 depletion in LNCaP cells. However, the
dependence of LNCaP cells on androgens for growth may also
make them vulnerable. AR is the only known non-kinase client
described for Cdc37, and Cdc37 participates in AR signaling as
shown in previous experiments using a forced-expression system
(13). Therefore, we next investigated the effects of Cdc37 targeting
on AR function in LNCaP cells. Indeed, depletion of Cdc37 induced
a cell morphology characteristic of androgen-dependent prostate
carcinoma undergoing androgen depletion (29)—the acquisition
of a neuroendocrine-like phenotype (Fig. 3A, left) characterized by
the formation of filamentous pseudopodia and dendrite-like
intercellular connections. Although cells infected with Cdc37
shRNA-expressing virus exhibited this morphology, transduction
of nontargeting control virus had no marked effect on LNCaP cell
morphology (Fig. 3A, right). Thus, Cdc37 targeting mimics some of
the morphologic effects of androgen depletion.
We next examined the molecular effects of Cdc37 depletion on AR
function in LNCaP cells. We first investigated androgen-dependent
transcription using a reporter construct containing an androgen
receptor element (ARE) promoter coupled to the luciferase gene.
This experimental promoter contains three copies of the full-length
promoter from the psa gene arranged in tandem. Although the
androgen, dihydrotestosterone (DHT), strongly activated this psa
promoter-reporter construct when transfected into LNCaP cells,
depletion of Cdc37 significantly reduced these transcriptional
responses to androgenic stimulation (Fig. 3B). We also examined
the effects of Cdc37 depletion on expression of the native psa gene
by measuring the concentration of intracellular PSA protein by
immunoblot assay. Exposure to DHT caused a dose-dependent
increase in PSA levels in control cells. However, Cdc37 knockdown
markedly reduced PSA levels both in unstimulated cells and after
exposure to DHT (Fig. 3C). Thus, AR and androgen-dependent
transcription are targets in growth inhibition by Cdc37 depletion.
Cdc37 knockdown sensitizes cells to the HSP90 inhibitor
17AAG. As our previous experiments suggested that Cdc37 and
HSP90 have distinct mechanisms for kinome maintenance and for
fostering cell growth, we next examined the potential of combining
Cdc37 targeting with HSP90 drugs. Combination of Cdc37 targeting
with the HSP90 inhibitor 17AAG was highly effective in inhibiting
the growth of PC3 and DU145 cells (Fig. 4A). Serial dilution 3-(4,5dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay indicates that Cdc37 knockdown sensitizes both cell lines to
killing by 17AAG by nearly a full log (Fig. 4A). Additive inhibition of
growth by HSP90 targeting drugs and Cdc37 depletion was then
confirmed by colony formation assay (Fig. 4B). Cdc37 depletion
markedly sensitized both DU-145 and PC3 cells to 17AAG and led
to a profound loss of clonogenicity.
Because 17AAG acts primarily by promoting the degradation of
HSP90 client proteins, we next examined whether Cdc37 targeting
might modulate these effects of HSP90 inhibition. We therefore
treated Cdc37 knockdown and control cells with increasing doses
of 17AAG and investigated the effects on protein kinase levels by

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (24). December 15, 2007

Western blot (Fig. 4C). Akt, a well-characterized HSP90/Cdc37
client, undergoes dose-dependent degradation in response to
increasing doses of 17AAG. However, these effects were greatly
potentiated in cells depleted of Cdc37, and quantitative loss of the
protein occurred (Fig. 4C). Thus, although Cdc37 depletion does
not in itself cause marked depletion of client proteins, it does
potentiate client protein loss when HSP90 is inhibited by 17AAG.
We also examined another potential pathway through which
Cdc37 depletion might lead to potentiation of cell killing by 17AAG.
We investigated one of the known pathways of resistance to HSP90
inhibitors, the induction of HSP70 by chemical inhibitors of HSP90
(30). HSP70 mediates resistance to treatment-induced death
pathways through its inhibitory effects on intracellular caspase
cascades (14). We therefore measured HSP70 levels in prostate
cancer cells treated with HSP90 inhibitors with or without Cdc37
depletion (Fig. 4C). We used the antibody Ab46-4 that detects a
number of HSP70 family members, including the constitutive
protein HSC70 that migrates with an apparent M r of 73 kDa and
the stress-inducible 72-kDa isoform HSP72, which is also present at
basal levels in prostate cancer cells (31). In cells depleted of Cdc37,
both baseline and 17AAG-stimulated levels of the HSP72 isoform
are greatly reduced, although expression of the more slowly
migrating HSC70 is not affected (Fig. 4C). The induction of HSP72,
which occurs even with low doses of HSP90 inhibitors, is prevented
at each dose of 17AAG in the Cdc37-depleted cells. The constitutive
HSC70 is unaffected under all conditions (Fig. 4C).
To determine additional mechanisms by which Cdc37 ablation
decreases HSP72 induction by 17AAG, we next examined whether
Cdc37 depletion affects HSP70 transcription. HSP70 induction
through HSP90 inhibition involves the transcription factor HSF1
(heat shock factor 1), a sequence-specific factor that regulates
expression of HSP genes through response elements in their
promoters (HSE; ref. 31). For these experiments, we employed a
promoter-luciferase reporter construct based on the HSP70B gene,
an HSP70 family gene that is activated by HSF1 with high
specificity. Transcription of HSP70B was strongly induced by
17AAG, as expected from previous studies (Fig. 4D). However,
following Cdc37 depletion, we observe significantly reduced basal
HSP70B activity as well as inhibition of the induced transcriptional
activity in cells treated with increasing doses of 17AAG (Fig. 4D).
This inhibitory effect of Cdc37 depletion on the induction of HSF1
activity was most clearly observed in Du145 cells, but could also be
seen in PC3 cells at high doses of 17AAG. Thus, Cdc37 seems to be
required for the trans-activation of HSF1 by 17AAG. Our studies
therefore suggest that sensitization of cells to 17AAG by Cdc37
depletion involves at least two mechanisms, including increased
loss of proteins required for growth and survival and inhibition of
induction of antiapoptotic protein HSP72.

Discussion
These studies indicate that Cdc37 is essential for growth and
survival of both AR+ and AR human prostate carcinoma cells
and suggest the possibility of targeting Cdc37 for treatment of
prostate cancer. Because the majority of prostate tumors and
cell lines have elevated levels of Cdc37 (Supplementary Fig. S1),
which seem essential for their growth, these studies suggest a
strategy for selective inhibition of prostate cancer growth.
Loss of Cdc37 seems to inhibit prostate tumor cell growth
through mechanisms that contrast with those that accompany
growth inhibition by HSP90 targeting (Figs. 1 and 2). Our finding

that Cdc37 depletion does not induce global degradation of its
clients was unanticipated because the widely reported effects of
HSP90 inhibitors on tumor growth invoke such a mechanism. Our
studies are also somewhat in discord with those employing model
systems to study Cdc37 in other species such as yeast and
Caenorhabditis elegans, which indicate that Cdc37 depletion can
reduce the levels of some clients (32, 33) and others in Drosophila
SL2 cells, which show that depletion of Cdc37 leads to decreased
levels of Aurora B (10). However, previous experiments in human
cancer cells accord with our findings and show that inhibition of
the HSP90/Cdc37/client protein complex did not lead to Aurora B
degradation in some tumor types (10). Species and tissue differences in the precise intracellular roles of Cdc37 may thus exist.
It has been shown in normal mammalian cells that Cdc37 is
responsible for recruiting newly formed kinases to the HSP90

machinery (4). However, in a background characterized by Cdc37
overexpression and overloading of HSP90 seen in many malignant
cells, this paradigm may be perturbed, and cryptic functions for
Cdc37 may be exposed. The elevated expression of Cdc37 observed
in cancer cells leads to partial chaperoning of client proteins
independently of HSP90 and the rescue of cells containing lethal
kinase mutations (34). In addition, only a small proportion of the
overexpressed Cdc37 molecules are found in complexes with
HSP90. Thus, in a setting where the HSP90 system is overworked by
the increased concentrations of unstable proteins characteristic of
cancer, overexpressed Cdc37 may function by buffering essential
kinases in an active state with reduced input from HSP90. Indeed,
Cdc37 seems to be especially important for kinase maturation (35).
In this study, Mandal et al. showed that functional Cdc37 promotes
optimal kinase activity for a number of clients without affecting the

overall levels of these proteins. Hinz et al. also recently reported
that Cdc37 is important for the maturation and enzymatic
competence of IKK complexes, but is not necessary for their
assembly or stability (36).

Our studies also suggest that AR-dependent prostate cancer cells
may be sensitive to Cdc37 loss (Fig. 3). Heightened sensitivity may
reflect the elevated Cdc37 levels in these cells (Supplementary
Fig. S1) and the dependence of AR function on Cdc37 (Fig. 3).

Cdc37 Targeting in Prostate Cancer

A regulatory role for Cdc37 in optimal androgen signaling was anticipated from previous investigations in yeast model systems (13).
However, our study is the first to show the requirement for Cdc37
in AR signaling and prostate cancer cell growth. Optimal AR
activation requires the input of a number of protein kinases, and
decreased AR activity after Cdc37 depletion may involve targeting
such kinases. However, given previous publications suggesting
direct interaction of Cdc37 with AR, it is likely that inhibition of
AR-dependent transcription involves both Cdc37 binding to AR
and the indirect effects of the protein kinase targeting mentioned
above (13, 37). Because the bulk of early prostate cancers are
androgen responsive, Cdc37 inhibition could be an effective
therapy for this subgroup and might be developed into a therapy
aimed at preventing the conversion of early-stage tumors into more
difficult to treat metastatic androgen-independent types.
The distinct properties of Cdc37 and HSP90 in fostering client
protein activity may underlie the ability of Cdc37 targeting to
sensitize tumor cells to HSP90 inhibition (Fig. 4). The finding that
Cdc37 depletion amplifies the effects of HSP90 inhibition was
initially unanticipated because HSP90 and Cdc37 perform cooperative/overlapping functions. However, in cells depleted of Cdc37,
the recruitment of protein kinases to HSP90 complexes might be
maintained through alternative co-chaperone interactions, including a possible role for Harc, a structural homologue of Cdc37 (38).
Thus, despite the overtaxing of the HSP90 system in many cancers,
cells may retain the residual ability to compensate for the loss of
Cdc37 and prevent complete degradation of clients through parallel
folding pathways. However, without the high levels of Cdc37
needed for kinase maturation and other molecular chaperone
functions in cancer cells, clients evidently become exquisitely
sensitive to HSP90 inhibition (Fig. 4C).
Our findings that HSF1 activity and HSP70 synthesis require
Cdc37 and are inhibited by Cdc37 depletion offer further rationale

for combined targeting of Cdc37 and Hsp90 (Fig. 4). HSF1 regulates
expression of HSP27 and HSP70, which are potent and versatile
inhibitors of both programmed cell death and treatment-induced
killing (14). HSF1 activity depends on signaling through the
phosphoinositide-3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathway and the Ras/ErkMAPK cascades (39). However, key intermediates in both these
pathways are degraded in the presence of HSP90 inhibitors, and
they are unlikely to be the major effectors in this case. We have
previously found that Cdc37 directly interacts with HSF1.1 Cdc37
may therefore participate in the release of HSF1 from HSP90
complexes, an essential step in HSF1 activation (40). Loss of HSP70
induction may contribute to the increased 17AAG-induced killing
in Cdc37-depleted cells (Fig. 4). Because increased levels of HSP70
and other HSPs contribute to the development of HSP90 inhibitor
resistance in cancer, combining HSP90 drugs with Cdc37 depletion
might be an attractive clinical option.
Overall, therefore, Cdc37 depletion irreversibly inhibits the
growth of prostate carcinoma cells, significantly affecting both
AR+ and AR cells. The effects of Cdc37 depletion seem to involve
both inhibition of growth-dependent signaling cascades and
antagonism of AR function. The effectiveness of Cdc37 depletion
in inhibiting growth of a wide range of prostate carcinoma cells
suggests a potentially novel treatment strategy for prostate cancer
through the pharmacologic development of Cdc37 inhibitors.
