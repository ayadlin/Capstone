ABSTRACT:
Doxorubicin-based chemotherapy represents one of the most effective ways in
combating human cancers. However, its clinical use is limited by severe side effects.
Selenocystine (SeC) is a natural available selenoamino acid with novel anticancer
efficacy. In this study, we used SeC to sensitize HepG2 human hepatocellular
carcinoma (HCC) cells to DOX, and to achieve anticancer synergism in vitro and in vivo.
Treatment with DOX dose-dependently reduced HepG2 cell viability through initiating
cell apoptosis and strong G2/M phase cell cycle arrest. Mechanistic studies indicated
that this sensitization of SeC to DOX was achieved by triggering inactivation of ERK
and AKT and DNA damage through reactive oxygen species (ROS) overproduction.
Pretreatment with inhibitors of ERK and AKT markedly enhanced combined treatmentinduced cell killing, indicating that combined treatment-induced HCC cell killing
with ERK- and AKT-dependent manner. Furthermore, inhibition of ROS effectively
attenuated combined treatment-induced DNA damage and inactivation of ERK and
AKT. Additionally, xenograft hepatocellular carcinoma growth was also effectively
inhibited by combined treatment through induction of cell apoptosis in vivo. Taken
together, our results suggest that the strategy to use SeC and DOX in combination
could be a highly efficient way to achieve anticancer synergism against HCC.

INTRODUCTION

frequently fatal [6-8]. Increasing studies proved that the
proposed mechanisms of anti-malignancy effects of DOX
ascribe to intercalation into DNA leading to inhibition
of synthesis of macromolecules, generation of reactive
oxygen species, DNA binding and DNA cross-linking
and DNA damage by inhibition of topoisomerase II, and
eventually induce apoptosis or/and cell cycle arrest [7, 9,
10]. Due to drug resistance and the severe side effects,
single-agent chemotherapy is no longer appropriate for
treating human tumors. Recently, combination (rather
than single-agent) chemotherapy has been found to be
a superior treatment strategy [1, 11-13]. Hence, much
effort has been made to identify chemo-sensitizers, that
is, agents that are able to augment efficiency of anticancer
drugs and simultaneously overcome multi-drug resistance
(MDR) and side effects [14-16].

Human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the fifth
most frequent neoplasm worldwide and the third leading
cause of cancer-related mortality [1-4]. To date, systemic
chemotherapeutic treatment is ineffective against HCC
cells, due to the resistance to apoptosis and severe sideeffect to normal tissues [5]. Therefore, new therapeutic
strategies are urgently needed. Doxorubicin (DOX), an
anthracycline antibiotic, is one of the most effective and
widely used chemotherapeutic agent for treatment of
human various malignancies, including metastatic breast
cancer, lymphomas and sarcomas, as well as other human
neoplasms [6, 7]. Nevertheless, the most common adverse
effects limiting the clinical use of DOX are cardiotoxicity
and even heart failure that carry a poor prognosis and are

Selenium (Se), as an essential mineral trace
element, is of much importance to animals and humans
[17]. Much evidences demonstrates that supplement of Se
can effectively reduce cancer risk [18-20]. Additionally,
recently studies indicated that Se has a potential to increase
the efficiency of cancer therapy where in combination
with other anticancer drugs [21, 22]. For instance, Li et
al reported that selenium can synergizes MCF-7 human
breast cancer cells to DOX-induced apoptosis through
modulation of phosphorylated AKT and its downstream
substrates [21]. However, the apoptotic mechanism
induced by Se-compounds remains elusive, especially this
synergistic effect of Se combination treatment.
Selenocystine (SeC) is a naturally available
selenoamino acid, which exhibits broad-spectrum antiproliferative activity against several human tumor
cells through oxidative stress-mediated apoptosis [23].

Despite this potency, SeC showed less toxic to HK-2
human normal cells, indicating the splendid selectivity
of SeC and predicting the potential application in cancer
chemoprevention [23, 24]. Moreover, we just reported
that SeC can synergize auranofin-induced apoptosis in
MCF-7 human breast cancer cells through triggering
ROS-mediated DNA damage by triggering thioredoxin
reductase (TrxR) [25]. In this study, we evaluated the
ability of SeC to synergize the inhibitory action of DOX
in HCC cells, and mechanistic investigation elucidated
that SeC as a potential chemo-sensitizer can dramatically
enhances DOX-induced cell killing against HCC cells
in vitro and in vivo by triggering ROS-mediated DNA
damage. Our study indicates that the strategy to use SeC
and DOX in combination could be a highly efficient way
to achieve anticancer synergism.

RESULTS

SeC for 48 h or with DOX for 24 h alone inhibited the
cell growth in dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1A and B).
Interestingly, combined treatments of the cells with SeC
and DOX significantly enhanced cell growth inhibition
(Fig. 1C, D and Fig. S1A). For instance, treatment of
HepG2 cells with 10 µM SeC for 48 h or with 100 nM
DOX for 24 h reduced cell viability by 13.8 % and 7.2
%, respectively. Nevertheless, combination of 10 µM
SeC (pretreatment for 24 h) with 100 nM DOX (cotreatment for another 24 h) significantly decreased the
cell viability by 38.8% (Fig. S1A), implying that SeC
effectively enhanced DOX-induced growth inhibition
against HepG2 cells. Cell morphological change further
confirmed the growth suppressive effect on HepG2 cells
(Fig. S1B). Additionally, the interaction mode between
SeC and DOX was examined by interaction index (γ) by
isobologram analysis. Preliminary studies found that the
IC50 value of SeC and DOX alone is 46.4 μM and 2.9 μM,
respectively. Moreover, treatment of cells with 20 μM
SeC in combination with 0.5 μM DOX displayed 50%
cell killing. Therefore, the interaction index was γ=0.6<1,
meaning that the combined effects between SeC and DOX
was strongly synergistic.
DOX is an auto-fluorescent agent, allowing the
visualization of its intracellular presence by fluorescence
microscopy. To investigate the synergetic effect of SeC and
DOX, intracellular accumulation of DOX was examined
by detecting the intracellular fluorescence of DOX in
HepG2 cells after treatment with SeC or /and DOX. As
expected, HepG2 cells after treatment with 100 nM DOX
alone showed weak red fluorescence in the nuclei (Fig.
1E). However, the intracellular fluorescence of DOX
in HepG2 cells after pretreatment with 10 μM SeC was
remarkable higher than that of DOX treatment alone (Fig.
1E and F). The enhanced fluorescence intensity of DOX
further confirmed this conclusion that, SeC pretreatment
enhanced DOX uptake in HepG2 cells (Fig. 1 F). Taken
together, these results indicate that SeC enhances DOXinduced cell killing ability through enhancing its cellular
uptake.

Screening experiments were performed to ascertain
the time and dose of SeC with DOX for the combined
treatment in HepG2 cells. Treatment of HepG2 cells with

arrest.

and DOX (100 and 200 nM) resulted in a enhanced cell
apoptosis compared with that of SeC and DOX alone, as
reflected by the increase in sub-G1 peaks (Fig. 2B, C).
Furthermore, DOX-induced G2/M-phase cell cycle arrest
was blocked at S-phase by SeC (Fig. 2E, F). Enhanced cell
apoptosis induced by combined treatment was confirmed
by caspase-3 activity using substrate Ac-DEVD-AMC.
As shown in Fig. 2D, pretreatment of HepG2 cells with
SeC significantly enhanced the DOX-induced activation of
caspase-3 from 103.6% (DOX), 106.8% (SeC) to 139.5%
(combination). Taken together, these results suggest that
SeC can act as an enhancer to sensitizes DOX-induced
HepG2 cell killing by induction of apoptosis and cell cycle
arrest.

whether MEK/ERK and PI3K/AKT signaling involved in
combined treatment-induced HCC cell growth inhibition,
western blotting method was employed to detect ERK
and AKT expression in vitro using phosphorylated
antibodies. As shown in Fig. 3A, treatment of HepG2
cells with SeC and DOX alone both slightly inhibited
the phosphorylation of ERK (Thr 202/Tyr 204) and AKT
(Ser 473). However, pretreatment of HepG2 cells with
SeC significantly enhanced DOX-induced inactivation
of ERK and AKT (Fig. 3A). To further evaluate the role
of SeC, a time course effect of SeC on ERK and AKT
expression was assayed. As expected, exposure of HepG2
cells to 10 μM SeC for indicated time resulted in a notable
down-regulation of ERK and AKT expression in timedependent manner (Fig. 3C), indicating that SeC can act as
an inhibitor of ERK and AKT to synergize DOX-induced
HepG2 cell growth inhibition. Based on the importance of
ERK and AKT, two inhibitors of ERK (U0126) and AKT
(LY294002) were used to determine combined treatmentinduced HepG2 cell killing. The MTT assay suggested
that pretreatment with inhibitors only for 1 h obviously
enhanced combined treatment-induced cell growth
inhibition against HepG2 cells (Fig. 3B). Pretreatment

ERK and AKT pathways contribute to the
combined treatment-induced growth inhibition
against HepG2 cells.
Accumulated evidences indicate that HCC cell
activation by different factors is known to increase
MEK/ERK and PI3K/AKT signaling [26]. To examine

of the cells with inhibitors of AKT (LY294002) and
ERK (U0126) for 1 h effectively enhanced the combined
treatment-induced dephosphorylation of ERK and AKT
(Fig. 3 D and E). These results all indicated that combined
treatment reduced HepG2 cell viability with ERK- and
AKT-dependent manner. SeC as inhibitors of ERK and
AKT signaling synergizes DOX-induced growth inhibition
against HepG2 cells.

of ROS as early event in regulating cell apoptosis or/and
cell cycle arrest. Abundant intracellular ROS may cause
DNA damage and activate down-streamed signaling
pathway. Therefore, combined treatment-induced DNA
damage was also detected using two DNA damage
markers, phosphorylated p53 (Ser 15) and phosphorylated
histone (Ser 139). As shown in Fig. 4B, treatment with
SeC and DOX alone both triggered DNA damage, as
convinced the up-regulated phosphorylated level of p53
and histone. However, combined treatment caused more
severe DNA damage (Fig. 4B). Moreover, the combined
treatment-induced DNA damage was further confirmed
by DAPI staining. As shown in Fig. S3, pretreatment
of HepG2 cells with SeC significantly enhanced DOXinduced chromatin condensation. Synergistic induction
of DNA fragmentation by SeC and DOX was further
confirmed by PI flow cytometric analysis, as evidenced
by the increase of Sub-G1 peak (Fig. 2). We speculated
the possibility that overproduced ROS induced by SeC
transfered into nucleus to enhance DOX-mediated DNA
damage. For further evaluation of ROS, two thiolreducing antioxidant, glutathione (GSH) and N-acetylL-cysteine (NAC), were introduced to examine the role
of intracellular ROS in combined treatment-induced cell
death. As shown in Fig. 4C, pretreatment with 5 mM NAC

SeC enhances DOX-induced DNA damage
through ROS overproduction.
DOX is reported to produce ROS as a part of its
anticancer mechanisms [9]. Our previously proved that
SeC can induced several human cancer cells apoptosis
through ROS-mediated oxidative damage [23]. Hence, we
asked whether SeC could enhance the ROS accumulation
induced by DOX. As expected, SeC treatment alone
caused apparent ROS overproduction in time-dependent
manner as convinced by the enhanced green fluorescence
intensity (Fig. S2). SeC pretreatment significantly
enhanced DOX-induced ROS generation in timedependent manner, and the ROS generation was observed
as early as 5 min (Fig. 4A), indicating the significance

reversed the combined treatment-induced reduction of
cell viability to 75.6% and 86.2%, respectively (Fig.
4C). In addition, GSH supplement effectively suppressed
combined treatment-induced DNA damage and attenuated
the inactivation of ERK and AKT (Fig. 4D), revealing the
importance of ROS in DNA damage and regulation of
ERK and AKT pathways.

SeC amplifies the therapeutic effect of DOX in
vivo.
To evaluate the synergetic effect of SeC and DOX
in vivo, immuno-deficient nude mice bearing HCC tumor
xenografts were employed to investigate the therapeutic
effect of SeC in combination with DOX. As expected, after
14 days’ administration, treatment of SeC and DOX alone
both slightly inhibited HCC tumor xenografts growth.
However, HCC tumor xenografts growth in rude mice
was more effectively inhibited by combined treatment
with SeC and DOX in vivo. For instance, combined
treatment with SeC and DOX significantly inhibited the
tumor volume (Fig. 5A, B) and tumor weight (Fig. 5C),
but not affected body weight of mice (Fig. 5D). The in
vivo mechanistic studies revealed that combined treatment
inhibited tumor xenografts by induction of AKT and ERK
inactivation and triggering DNA damage (Fig. 6 A), which
were consistent with the results in vitro. Furthermore,
several cell markers using IHC methods further confirmed
that combined treatment triggered cell apoptosis (cleaved
caspase-3 staining), inhibited angiopoiesis (CD31
staining), activated p53 phosphorylation (Ser15-p53
staining) and inhibited tumor xenografts cell proliferation
(Ki67 staining) (Fig. 6B). Statistic analysis of the protein
expression levels by Leica QW550 software further
confirmed this anti-tumor effect in vivo (Fig. S4). Taken
together, these results all indicated that SeC synergizes
the therapeutic effect of DOX in vivo by DNA damagemediated p53 phosphorylation.

or GSH for 2 h effectively prevented HepG2 cells from
combined treatment-induced cell growth inhibition. For
instance, combination treatment of SeC (10 µM) with
DOX (100 nM) decreased the cell viability to 59.9%.
However, pretreatment of cells with 5 mM NAC or GSH

DISCUSSION
In the present study, we validated for the first time
that SeC synergizes DOX-mediated HepG2 cell killing in
vitro and in vivo and the possible mechanisms. The results
show that DOX inhibited the growth of HepG2 cells by
induction of G2/M cell cycle arrest, and SeC induced
growth inhibition against HepG2 cell through S-phase
arrest and cell apoptosis. However, combined treatment
with DOX and SeC significantly inhibited the growth of
HepG2 cells by dual-cell cycle arrest and enhanced cell
apoptosis. Inhibition of HepG2 cells induced by combined
treatment was associated with increased ROS generation,
DNA damage, and inactivation of ERK and AKT pathway.
DOX as one of the most effective chemotherapeutic
agent was widely used for treating human various

malignancies [6-8, 20]. Nevertheless, the side effects,
especially the severe cardiotoxicity, badly limited its
clinical usage. In the present study, we used SeC, a low
cytotoxic agent, to synergize the therapeutic effect of
DOX, and the result suggested that the combined treatment
effectively induced the HepG2 cell killing. Meanwhile, the
combined strategy reduces the effective dosage of DOX
(only 100 nM), but enhance the pharmaceutical effect of
DOX, which has the potential to minimize/reverse the side
effects and multi-drug resistance (MDR) of DOX with
promising application in clinic.
Induction of cell apoptosis or/and cell cycle arrest
by chemo-preventive and chemotherapeutic agents in
cancer cells is an effective strategy to halt tumor growth
[27]. The tumor suppressor p53 is a cell cycle checkpoint
protein that contributes to the preservation of genetic
stability by mediating either cell cycle arrest or apoptosis
in response to DNA damage [28, 29]. The major molecular
sensors, including ATM, ATR, and DNA-PK, can be
recruited in response to DNA damage, accompanied
by the activation of p53 and downstream pathway [3032]. Finally, activated p53 can cause cell cycle arrest or
apoptosis to repair/eliminate the damaged cells [33-37].
In the present study, treatment with DOX and SeC alone
both triggered the phosphorylation of p53 and histone,
indicating that DOX and SeC both induced DNA damage.
Combined treatment resulted in enhanced DNA damage,
as convinced by increased expression of p53 and histone.
Activation of p53 in response to DNA damage finally
induced apoptosis and cell cycle arrest in HepG2 cells.
Recent studies found that the Ras/Raf/MAPK and
PI3K/AKT/mTOR are two activated pathways in HCC
cells [26, 32, 38-40]. The PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling
pathway plays a pivotal role in HCC and is activated in 3050% of HCC cases [26]. Therefore, searching for effective
inhibitors targeting these signaling pathway or their
components represents a promising therapeutic strategy
recently. In this study, we showed that the combined
treatment with SeC and DOX notably decreased ERK
and AKT phosphorylation in cancer cells. Furthermore,
pretreatment of the cells with inhibitor of ERK and AKT
significantly enhanced the combined treatment-induced
cell killing, indicating that ERK and AKT pathway both
contributed to combined treatment-induced growth
inhibition against HepG2 cells. The results indicated that
SeC as potential inhibitors of ERK and AKT showed
promising application in treating human hepatocellular
carcinoma.
Human tumor cell killing by chemotherapy agents
was usually ascribed to the accumulation of intracellular
ROS [41]. Overproduction of intracellular ROS may
attack cellular membrane lipids, proteins, DNA and cause
oxidative injury, and finally result in reduction of cell
cycle arrest or/and cell apoptosis to repair or eliminate
the damaged cells [42]. DOX is known to produce ROS
as a part of its anticancer mechanisms [9]. Our previous
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

studies found that SeC could induce several human cancer
cell apoptosis by induction of ROS generation [23].
Consistent with expected results, we confirm that DOX
and SeC treatment alone both caused significant ROS
accumulation. Although ROS generation was greater in
SeC-treated cells, combination of DOX with SeC further
enhanced ROS overproduction.
In view of ROS production, we performed the
western blotting method to assess DNA damage using
specific phosphorylated antibody, Ser 15-p53 and Ser
139-histone, both DNA damage markers. The results
showed that SeC and DOX pretreatment alone both
slightly caused DNA damage in HepG2 cells, as convinced
by the up-regulation of Ser 15-p53 and Ser 139-histone.
Although DNA damage level was higher in SeC-treated
cells, combination treatment with DOX and SeC resulted
in severer DNA damage in HepG2 cells. However,
blocking of ROS production with
ROS scavengers, GSH and NAC, both thiolinducing antioxidants, effectively prevented HepG2
cells from combined treatment-mediated cell killing.
Moreover, elimination of ROS by GSH also significantly
attenuated phosphorylation of histone and inactivation
of ERK and AKT, indicating that ROS act as a early
mediator in regulating DNA damage and ERK and AKT
pathway. These results provided a possibility that, SeC
inside the cells may oxidize intracellular thiol-containing
antioxidant agents. Addition of GSH and NAC not only
eliminated ROS, but also replenished intracellular stores
of endogenous thiol-containing antioxidants. Our previous
studies have already confirmed the conclusion that, ROS
as upstream mediator can regulation the phosphorylation
of ERK and AKT. Meanwhile, addition of GSH
effectively inhibited ROS generation and suppressed the
dephosphorylation of ERK and AKT [34]. Taken together,
our results suggest that ROS overproduction lead to the
induction of DNA damage, and inactivation of ERK and
AKT, leading to the activation of caspase-3 to induce
apoptosis and cell cycle arrest.
In summary, we combined DOX with SeC to
enhance HepG2 cell killing by induction of apoptosis and
cell cycle arrest through ROS-mediated DNA damage.
We also demonstrated the synergistic effect of DOX/
SeC combination on suppression of tumor growth in vivo
using a xenograft tumor model. Our results suggest that
combining low dose of DOX with suboptimal dose of SeC
can serve as a potential combination therapy for treatment
of human hepatocellular carcinoma with the potential to
minimize/eliminate the side effects associated with high
doses of DOX.

1×106 HepG2 cells in 100 μL serum-free medium were
subcutaneously injected into the right oxter of mice.
When average tumor volume reached about 50 mm3

after 1 week, mice were randomly divided into four
groups (8 mice/group): Group 1 for PBS as control;
Group 2 for 5 mg/kg SeC; Group 3 for 2 mg/kg DOX;
Group 4 for 5 mg/kg SeC + 2 mg/kg DOX. Drugs were
injected every other day, caudal vein, from the first day
until the fourteenth day (7 times). At the termination of
the experiments, tumors were harvested, photographed
and weighed. Tumor dimensions were measured with
calipers and the volume was calculated using the formula:
volume = l×w2/2, with l being the maximal length and w
being the width. A portion of the tumors from control and
treated animals was used for preparation of tumor lysate
used in further analysis. Another portion of tumors were
removed, ﬁxed in 10% buffered formalin, embedded
with parafﬁn and sectioned. The 4-μM sections were
stained with hematoxylin and eosin staining (HE) for
histological observation. Protein expression in sections
was examined by immunohistochemical (IHC) methods.
All animal experiments were approved by the Animal
Experimentation Ethics Committee.

Statistical analysis.
Experiments were carried out at least in triplicate
and repeated three times. All data were expressed as mean
± S.D. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS
statistical package (SPSS 13.0 for Windows; SPSS, Inc.
Chicago, IL). The difference between two groups was
analyzed by two-tailed Student’s t-test. The difference
between three or more groups was analyzed by one-way
analysis of variance multiple comparisons. Differences
with P<0.05 (*) or P<0.01 (**) was considered statistically
significant. Bars with different characters are statistically
different at P<0.05 level. The interaction mode between
SeC and Dox was analyzed by the interaction index which
is based on “isobologram analysis” [34, 43]. The index,
denoted by γ, is deﬁned by the isobolar relation: a/A +
b/B = γ, where A and B are the doses of SeC and DOX
used, which give 50% cell killing, and a and b are the
combination doses that produce the same activity. The
quantities in equation are obtained from the dose response
curves of drugs A, B, and the combined treatments. If γ=1,
the interaction is additive; if γ<1, it is synergistic; if γ>1,
it is antagonistic.
