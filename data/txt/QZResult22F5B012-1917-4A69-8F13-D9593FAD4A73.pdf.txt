BACKGROUND: Increasing evidence shows chemotherapy in combination with vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) inhibition is
a clinically active therapy for patients with metastatic melanoma (MM). METHODS: A phase 2 trial was conducted in chemotherapynaive patients with unresectable stage IV MM who were randomized to temozolomide (200 mg/m2 on days 1 through 5) and bevacizumab (10 mg/kg intravenously on days 1 and 15) every 28 days (Regimen TB) or nab-paclitaxel (100 mg/m2, or 80 mg/m2 postaddendum 5 secondary to toxicity, on days 1, 8, and 15), bevacizumab (10 mg/kg on days 1 and 15), and carboplatin (area under the
curve [AUC] 6 on day 1, or AUC 5 post-addendum 5) every 28 days (Regimen ABC). Accrual goal was 41 patients per regimen. The
primary aim of this study was to estimate progression-free survival rate at 6 months (PFS6) in each regimen. A regimen would be
considered promising if its PFS6 rate was > 60%. RESULTS: Ninety-three eligible patients (42 TB and 51 ABC) were enrolled. The majority of patients had M1c disease (20 TB and 26 ABC). The median PFS and overall survival times with ABC were 6.7 months and 13.9
months, respectively. Median PFS time and median overall survival with TB were 3.8 months and 12.3 months, respectively. The most
common severe toxicities ( grade 3) in both regimens were cytopenias, fatigue, and thrombosis. Among the first 41 patients enrolled
onto each regimen, PFS6 rate was 32.8% (95% confidence interval: 21.1%-51.2%) for TB and 56.1% (90% confidence interval: 44.7%70.4%) for ABC. CONCLUSIONS: The addition of bevacizumab to nab-paclitaxel and carboplatin shows promising activity despite tolC 2012 American Cancer Society.

INTRODUCTION
Melanoma affected approximately 60,000 people in the United States in 2010,1 with approximately 8000 deaths.1 Until
very recently, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) had only approved 2 drugs, dacarbazine (5-(3,3-dimethyl-1triazenyl)imidazole-4-carboxamide [DTIC]) and interleukin-2 (IL-2) for clinical use in patients with metastatic melanoma (MM).2,3 In 2011, two new agents received FDA approval for MM: ipilimumab (anti-CTLA4 antibody) and
vemurafenib (BRAF V600E inhibitor). Both agents were approved in the United States based on completed phase 3

VEGF Inhibition for Stage IV Melanoma/Kottschade et al

clinical trials demonstrating superior survival endpoints
of overall survival (OS) or progression-free survival (PFS).
In the case of ipilimumab, an OS advantage was observed
over that of a peptide vaccine (gp100)4 and in the case of
vemurafenib, a PFS advantage was observed over that of
DTIC.5,6
Over the past several years, our research team has
engaged in an effort to assess the clinical utility of combinational therapeutics involving cytotoxic chemotherapy
and inhibitors of angiogenesis in patients with MM. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) has been shown
to play a significant role in the natural history of malignant melanoma.7,8 In particular, the role of VEGF
appears in the context of melanoma therapy with cytotoxic agents. Laboratory evidence demonstrates that malignant melanocytes exposed to conventional cytotoxic
agents (DTIC) dramatically up-regulate VEGF production.9,10 Thus, the addition of a VEGF-blocking agent in
the context of systemic chemotherapy for MM may yield
antitumor benefits beyond those of chemotherapy alone.
Bevacizumab is a recombinant humanized murine
monoclonal antibody to VEGF-A that blocks the binding
of VEGF-A to its receptors, thereby inhibiting its biologic
activity.11 In 2009, we reported that the combination of
bevacizumab with paclitaxel and carboplatin for patients
with MM resulted in modest clinical benefit in a singlearm phase 2 clinical trial.12 A randomized comparison of
paclitaxel/carboplatin/bevacizumab (PCB) to paclitaxel/
carboplatin (PC) in patients with MM reported a trend
toward a survival benefit of PCB over PC,13,14 even
though the study did not reach its primary objective of
statistically significant PFS advantage in the PCB arm.
Thus, in an effort to improve on these observations, we
sought to identify a more effective chemotherapy regimen
that, in combination with bevacizumab, would yield
greater clinical benefit. As such, we conducted a randomized phase 2 clinical trial in chemotherapy-naive patients
with MM to assess the antitumor activity and safety profiles of nab-paclitaxel (Abraxane; Celgene, Summit, NJ)/
bevacizumab/carboplatin (ABC) and temozolomide/bevacizumab (TB) regimens.
MATERIALS AND METHODS:
This phase 2 clinical trial randomized previously
untreated patients with MM to either regimen TB (temozolomide 200 mg/m2 orally on days 1 through 5 and bevacizumab 10 mg/kg intravenously [IV] on days 1 and 15
of a 28-day cycle repeated until disease progression) or
regimen ABC (nab-paclitaxel 100 mg/m2 IV on days 1, 8,
and 15, bevacizumab 10 mg/kg IV on days 1 and 15, and
Cancer

carboplatin at area under the curve [AUC] of 6 IV on day
1, of a 28-day cycle until disease progression). A stratified
randomization procedure was employed (when both regimens were open to enrollment) using Eastern Cooperative
Oncology Group performance status (PS) and M substage
(M1a,b,c) to assign patients in equal number to the 2 regimens. The primary aim of this study was to independently
assess the antitumor activity and safety profile of each regimen. The study was not designed to compare efficacy
between the 2 regimens. The approach of conducting 2
concurrent phase 2 clinical trials (with randomization) in
1 study was done to streamline the protocol development
process, eliminate potential selection bias, and ensure consistent evaluation and surveillance. This study was conducted as a multi-institution cooperative group trial
through the North Central Cancer Treatment Group
(NCCTG). All patients provided signed informed written
consent. This study was approved by the institutional
review boards of all participating institutions.
The study data safety monitoring plan included
criteria for suspending enrollment to any given regimen
for an unacceptable toxicity. For a given regimen, if 2 or
more of the first 5 patients enrolled or 30% or more
thereafter developed  grade 3 (Common Terminology
Criteria for Adverse Events [CTCAE], version 3.0) nonhematologic or hematologic toxicity (excluding grade 3
neutropenia or thrombocytopenia) possibly, probably, or
definitely related to treatment, enrollment would be suspended and a trial recommendation would be formulated
and submitted for review to the Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program/National Cancer Institute (CTEP/NCI) and
institutional review boards. Under these conditions, enrollment to regimen ABC was suspended from June 22, 2009
to August 14, 2009, when 9 of the first 28 patients
randomized to regimen ABC developed severe thrombosis
(3 patients), hypertension (2 patients), dyspnea and fatigue
(2 patients), hemorrhage (1 patient), and oral mucositis (1
patient). The study was amended to reduce the starting
dose of both nab-paclitaxel and carboplatin to 80 mg/m2
and AUC 5, respectively.
Enrollment to regimen TB closed prior to that of regimen ABC due to suspension of accrual to regimen ABC, secondary to toxicity. As regimen ABC closed in on its accrual
goal of 41 patients, proper notice was sent to the memberships stating that enrollment would close in 3 weeks. An
unexpected jump in accrual rate occurred, leading to 52 total
patients being enrolled to this regimen. The 23 patients who
were enrolled to regimen ABC after addendum 5 was put
into place will be referred to as the ‘‘post-addendum 5’’
patients (postadd5) for the purposes of this report.

Eligibility

Eligible patients had to be  18 years of age with unresectable, histologically confirmed MM. Additional eligibility
criteria included measurable disease by the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST, version 1.0);
ECOG PS of 0 or 1; adequate hematologic, renal, and hepatic function; life expectancy of  4 months; and no
prior chemotherapy for MM. Exclusion criteria included
prior exposure to taxanes, agents disrupting VEGF activity in the adjuvant setting; peripheral neuropathy  grade
2; major surgical procedure, open biopsy, or significant
trauma  4 weeks prior to randomization; brain metastases per magnetic resonance imaging (MRI); active infection requiring parenteral antibiotics; poorly controlled
hypertension; New York Heart Association Class II-IV
congestive heart failure; serious cardiac arrhythmia; myocardial infarction or unstable angina ( 6 months); clinically significant peripheral vascular disease; deep venous
thrombosis or pulmonary embolus within  1 year; need
for full-dose anticoagulation therapy; active bleeding or
known condition that carries a high risk of bleeding; nonhealing wound; history of abdominal fistula, gastrointestinal perforation, or intra-abdominal abscess within  6
months; central nervous system disease (primary brain tumor, vascular abnormalities); stroke or transient ischemic
attack ( 6 months); uncontrolled seizures; radiographically documented invasion of adjacent organs (duodenum, stomach) or tumor invading major blood vessels,
known to be positive for human immunodeficiency virus
or have hepatitis. Women who were pregnant or breast
feeding were also not eligible for participation.
Assessments

Within 14 days of registration, patients underwent a complete physical examination, assessment of performance
status, complete blood counts with differential, comprehensive metabolic panel (including lactate dehydrogenase), urinalysis for proteinuria, and tumor assessment by
conventional computed tomography (CT), spiral CT, or
MRI. Within 28 days of registration, patients underwent
MRI of the brain (CT if MRI was not able to be performed) to assess for the presence of brain metastasis.
Prior to each cycle of treatment, patients underwent a
physical examination, toxicity assessments (CTCAE, version 3.0) and laboratory (urine and blood) testing. Tumor
status was assessed every 8 weeks until progression
(RECIST, version 1.0). All patients received standard
supportive care, including antiemetics, antibiotics, transfusions, and growth factor support as clinically
appropriate.
588

For patients on regimen TB, treatment was held on
day 1 of the cycle if their absolute neutrophil count
(ANC) was < 1500 mm3, platelet count (PLT) was <
75,000 mm3 or the patient experienced > grade 3 nonhematologic toxicity. Once blood counts recovered to above
these levels and/or other nonhematologic adverse events
resolved to  grade 1, patients were eligible for re-treatment at a lower dose level of temozolomide (reduction of
50 mg/m2/day). There were no dose reductions allowed
on either regimen for toxicities related to bevacizumab. If
a patient had a toxicity that was felt to be related to bevacizumab, further dosing was held or discontinued based on
the specific toxicity. Treatment could be held for up to 4
weeks.
For patients on regimen ABC, treatment was held
on day 1 of the cycle if ANC < 1500 mm3; PLT <
75,000 mm3;  grade 2 AST, alkaline phosphatase, or peripheral neuropathy; or any other  grade 3 nonhematologic toxicity. Patients could be retreated at a lower dose
level (20% dose reduction of nab-paclitaxel and carboplatin decreased by 1 AUC). As with regimen TB, there were
no dose reductions allowed for toxicities related to bevacizumab. If a patient had a toxicity that was felt to be related
to bevacizumab, patients were to have their dose held or
discontinued based on the specific toxicity. Treatment
could be held for up to 4 weeks.
Statistical Analysis

The primary endpoint for evaluating each regimen was
the 6 month progression-free survival rate. Under the
assumption that all 41 patients randomized to a given regimen will be followed at least 6 months (or until death), a
1-sided a ¼ 0.10 one-sample test of proportions will have
a 90% chance of detecting that the true 6-month PFS rate
with that regimen is at least 60% when the true 6-month
PFS rate for the regimen is greater than 40%. If any
patients were lost to follow-up within 6 months of registration, the 6-month PFS rate would be estimated using
the Kaplan-Meier method. If a patient died without documentation of progression, the patient was considered to
have progressed at death.
Quantification of Plasma VEGF Levels

Plasma levels of VEGF-A and VEGF-D were measured
using Duoset antibodies from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN) as per manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, 96well plates were coated overnight at 4 C with capture
antibodies at 1.0 lg/mL and 2.0 lg/mL for VEGF-A and
VEGF-D, respectively. The plates were washed and
blocked for 1 hour at room temperature with reagent diluent, and 50 lL of undiluted plasma was added to wells in

duplicate and incubated for 2 hours at room temperature.
The plates were washed with phosphate-buffered saline
and 0.5% Tween-20, and 100 ng/mL VEGF-A and 200
ng/mL VEGF-D biotinylated detection antibodies were
added for 1 hour at room temperature and was followed
by incubation with a streptavidin horseradish peroxidase
complex. Color was developed with tetramethylbenzidine

RESULTS
Patient Characteristics

Ninety-five patients (regimen TB: 43 patients; regimen
ABC: 52 patients) were enrolled into this trial between
August 15, 2008, and January 12, 2010 (Table 1). One
patient randomized to regimen TB was found ineligible at
the time of registration due to brain metastasis. One
patient assigned to regimen ABC withdrew consent prior
to study treatment. Therefore, regimen TB included 42
patients (57.1% male) aged 25 to 82 years (median age,
57 years). Regimen ABC included 51 patients (56.9%
male) aged 22 to 83 years (median age, 57 years). The
characteristics of the patients were well balanced between
the treatment regimens (Table 1).

abdominal hemorrhage (n ¼ 1). Two patients died while
on study treatment, including a 72-year-old woman with
bone metastases previously treated with radiation who died
during cycle 1 from complications of bone marrow suppression and a 47-year-old woman who died during cycle 1 due
to rapid disease progression. The reasons for treatment discontinuation among the remaining 36 patients are disease
progression (n ¼ 32), refusal (n ¼ 3), and other medical
condition (n ¼ 1).
Regimen ABC

At the time of this report, all but 1 patient had discontinued study treatment. The median number of cycles
administered is 4 cycles (total > 310 cycles; range, 1 to >
33). The most common severe ( grade 3) toxicities
reported included: neutropenia (49%), leukopenia
(27%), thrombocytopenia (20%), anemia (20%), fatigue
(16%), and thrombosis (12%) as shown in Table 2.
Twelve patients (8 pre-addendum 5 and 4 post-addendum 5) discontinued study treatment due to the following
 grade 3 adverse events: thrombosis/thrombus/embolism (preadd5 ¼ 5 patients; postadd5 ¼ 1 patient) neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, with renal failure
(preadd5 ¼ 1 patient), pleural effusion and pancreatitis
(preadd5 ¼ 1 patient), thrombocytopenia (preadd5 ¼ 1
patient), infection (postadd5 ¼ 2 patients), and persistent
fatigue (postadd5 ¼ 1 patient). The reasons for treatment
discontinuation among the other 38 patients were disease
progression (n ¼ 28), patient refusal (n ¼ 3), desire for alternative therapy (n ¼ 6), and unacceptable treatment
delay secondary to Port-A-Cath placement (n ¼ 1).
Clinical Efficacy
Regimen TB

All but one patient (who refused further follow-up) were
followed for a minimum of 16 months or until death. At
last contact, 3 patients were alive without disease progression, 5 patients were alive with disease progression, and
34 patients had died of their disease.
Among the first 41 eligible patients randomized to
TB, the Kaplan-Meier estimate for the 6 month PFS rate
was 32.8% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 21.1%51.2%); thus, ruling out a 6-month PFS rate of 60% or
more. Considering all 42 eligible patients randomized to
Regimen TB, the tumor response rate (TRR) was 23.8%
(95% CI: 12.1%-39.5%), with 9 partial responses and 1
complete response. The median PFS and OS times were
estimated to be 3.8 months (95% CI: 3.0-6.2 months)
and 12.3 months (95% CI: 9.3-15.3 months), respectively (Fig. 1).

Figure 1. Survival and progression curves are shown for Regimen A.

Regimen ABC

All 51 patients were followed for a minimum of 16.5
months or until death. At last contact, 4 patients were
alive without disease progression, 9 patients were alive
with disease progression, and 37 patients had died of their
disease.
Among the first 41 eligible patients randomized to
ABC, the Kaplan-Meier estimate for the 6-month PFS rate
was 56.1% (90% CI: 44.7%-70.4%), thereby not excluding a 6-month PFS rate of 60% or more. Considering all
51 eligible patients randomized to Regimen ABC, the overall 6-month PFS rate was 54.9% (90% CI: 42.8-70.4%)
with a PFS6 in the preadd5 and postadd5 cohorts of 60.7%
(90% CI: 47.3%-78.0%) and 47.8% (90% CI: 33.4%68.4%), respectively. There were 17 partial responses and
no complete responses, yielding an overall TRR of 33.3%
(95% CI: 20.8%-47.9%). The TRR among the preadd5
and postadd5 cohorts was 35.7% (95% CI: 18.6%-55.9%)
and 30.4% (95% CI: 13.2%-52.9%), respectively.
The overall median PFS time was estimated to be
6.7 months (95% CI: 5.6-9.5 months). In addition, the
median PFS in the preadd5 and postadd5 cohorts was 9.4
months (95% CI: 5.7-11.6 months) and 5.4 months
(95% CI: 3.1-8.8 months), respectively. The overall median OS was estimated to be 13.9 months (95% CI: 10.717.5 months). Finally, the preadd5 and postadd5 OS rates
were 14.5 months (95% CI: 9.9-22.0 months) and 13.8
months (95% CI: 6.5-18.7 months), respectively (Fig. 2).
Changes in Plasma VEGF-A and VEGF-D Levels

Serial measurements of plasma VEGF-A and VEGF-D
levels were obtained prior to each treatment as well as at
time of progression. Bevacizumab is a primarily VEGFA–neutralizing antibody, and we sought to understand
whether its use affected the levels of VEGF-D as well.
Emerging evidence suggests that VEGF-D plays a central

role in intratumoral endothelial cell survival.15 Our data
demonstrated that among the 30 patients on regimen
TBand 44 patients on regimen ABC who had at least 1
postregistration determination of VEGF-A and VEGF-D,
there were decrements in VEGF-A levels in a majority of
the patients after 1 cycle of treatment (Fig. 3). However,
changes in VEGF-A or VEGF-D levels during treatment
did not correlate with clinical response to treatment.

Figure 2. Survival and progression curves are shown for Regimen B.

DISCUSSION
The current study trial was primarily built on the findings
from our previous phase 2 trial of nab-paclitaxel and carboplatin (study N057E) that reported a median PFS time
of 4.3 months and median OS of 11.1 months among
chemotherapy-naive patients, and 4.2 months and 10.9
months, respectively, among those previously treated.16
Toxicities encountered included nausea, vomiting, peripheral neuropathy, and cytopenias necessitating the
lower starting doses of nab-paclitaxel and carboplatin. In
the current trial, the addition of bevacizumab to nabpaclitaxel and carboplatin (ABC regimen) shows promising activity in both PFS (6.7 months) and OS (13.9
months) despite tolerability issues, relative to N057E as
well as historical benchmarks of other therapies for MM

tested in the National Cancer Institute Cooperative
Groups.17 Notably, the initial dosing schedule of nabpaclitaxel 100 mg/m2 IV on days 1, 8, and 15, carboplatin
at AUC of 6 IV on day 1, and bevacizumab 10 mg/kg IV
days 1 and 15 of a 28-day cycle induced higher incidence
of cytopenias, fatigue, hypertension, nausea, thrombosis,
and neuropathy than expected, which required lower
starting doses of nab-paclitaxel and carboplatin to 80 mg/
m2 and AUC 5, respectively. Although there was some
difference in PFS (9.4 months for the preadd5 group and
5.4 months for the postadd5 group), OS was largely unaffected (14.5 months for preadd5 and 13.8 months for
postadd5). The ABC regimen of our current study also
compares favorably to 2 prior phase 2 studies evaluating
bevacizumab combinations with paclitaxel and carboplatin, which demonstrated median PFS and OS times in the
5- and 12-month range, respectively.12,13
In this study, we also evaluated the utility of the
addition of bevacizumab to temozolomide (regimen TB),
a commonly used chemotherapeutic agent in MM. The
TB regimen resulted in a median PFS time of 3.8 months,
which is similar to the median PFS of 4.2 months
reported by von Moos et al,18 thus confirming their observation. The TB regimen was well tolerated in both trial
populations.
In conclusion, the last several years have witnessed a
tremendous effort in developmental therapeutics for
MM, resulting in the FDA approval of 2 new agents, ipilimumab and vemurafenib, in 2011.5,19 Our current study
found that the addition of bevacizumab to nab-paclitaxel
and carboplatin (regimen ABC) shows promising activity
in terms of both PFS and OS that is comparable to that of
ipilimumab and vemurafenib. Toxicity on this regimen
was somewhat higher than was seen on the TB arm with
more grade 3 toxicities, but with careful monitoring, this
is still a generally acceptable safety profile. Its place in the
treatment armamentarium for metastatic melanoma
should be explored in the phase 3 clinical trial setting.
