Abstract
Constitutive activation of the mitogen-activated protein
kinase (MAPK) pathway is implicated in the development
and progression of many human cancers, including melanoma. Mutually exclusive activating mutations in NRAS or BRAF
have been identified in f85% of melanomas, and components
of this pathway have been developed as molecular targets for
therapeutic intervention. We and others have shown that
inhibition of this pathway with specific small molecule MAPK/
extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase (MEK) inhibitors
induces a wide range of apoptotic responsiveness in human
melanoma cells both in vitro and in vivo. To define the
molecular mechanism underlying variable apoptotic sensitivity of melanoma cells to MEK inhibition, we examined the
expression and subcellular localization of Bcl-2 family
members in a comprehensive set of human melanoma cell
lines. Whereas the proapoptotic protein Bim was activated
and localized to the mitochondrial membrane in all cell
lines regardless of apoptotic sensitivity, Bmf activation and
cytosolic translocation was exclusive to sensitive cells. In
resistant cells, Bmf remained sequestered to the cytoskeleton
through dynein light chain 2 (DLC2) binding. Overexpression
of Bmf in resistant cells did not enhance apoptosis, whereas
expression of mutant BmfA69P, which has decreased binding
to DLC2, promoted cell death. Expression of BmfA69P mutants
possessing the Bcl-2 homology 3 (BH3) domain mutation
L138A, which impairs BH3 interactions, did not enhance
apoptosis in resistant cells. RNA interference targeting Bim
and Bmf provided protection from apoptosis induced by
MEK inhibition. These results show a novel role for Bmf in
promoting apoptosis and provide insight into the mechanism
of apoptotic resistance to MEK inhibition in melanoma.

Introduction
Skin cancer is the most common malignancy in the United
States, representing nearly one third of all newly diagnosed
cancers. Melanoma accounts for only 4% of all skin cancers but
is responsible for 79% of skin cancer deaths (1). During the last
20 years, the incidence of melanoma has more than tripled in
Caucasian Americans with an estimated 62,480 new cases
diagnosed in 2008 (1). Melanoma is the most common cancer in

men and women of ages 20 to 29 years and the leading cause of
cancer death in women between the ages of 25 to 29 years.4 In 1940,
the lifetime risk of developing melanoma was 1 in 1,500, which
contrasts sharply with current estimates of 1 in 614 (1). Currently, the
alkylating agent dacarbazine (DTIC) is the only Food and Drug
Administration–approved chemotherapeutic agent for treating melanoma. Clearly, current therapies used to treat metastatic melanoma
are inadequate, as the 5-year survival rate has remained at <15%
for decades with over 8,000 deaths annually (1). With mutually
exclusive mutations in NRAS and BRAF, this pathway is constitutively
activated in most cases of sporadic malignant melanomas (2) and
several clinical trials of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)/
extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) kinase (MEK)–targeted
therapies in melanoma have focused on exploiting the dependence
of these tumors on MAPK signaling. Additionally, f50% of those
with BRAF mutations also have AKT3 amplification or PTEN loss,
resulting in deregulation of AKT signaling (3).
Recent in vitro data suggest that MAPK and AKT signaling
promotes melanoma cell survival through the regulation of Bcl-2
protein family members (4–6), which are essential regulators of the
apoptotic pathway. The antiapoptotic members Bcl-2, Bcl-XL,
Mcl-1, Bcl-w, and Bfl-1 each possess four domains termed Bcl-2
homology (BH) domains and are often overexpressed in many
cancer types, including melanoma. They regulate the release of
cytochrome c from the mitochondria by sequestering proapoptotic
Bcl-2 family members. The proapoptotic members fall into two
subgroups: those containing BH1-BH3 domains (Bak, Bax, and Bok)
and those possessing BH3 domains only (Bad, Bim, Bmf, Bik, Hrk,
Bid, Puma, and Noxa). Upon release from antiapoptotic members
(e.g., Bcl-2), Bax and/or Bak oligomerizes to induce release of
apoptosis-promoting proteins (including cytochrome c) from the
mitochondrial intermembrane space. In response to various deathpromoting stimuli, BH3-only members are activated by multiple
means, including posttranslational modification, transcriptional upregulation, and subcellular localization (7). BH3-only proteins exhibit
selective binding affinities for antiapoptotic Bcl-2 proteins; therefore,
activation of two or more can enhance apoptosis depending on the
repertoire of antiapoptotic proteins that are present (8).
Increasing evidence suggests that BH3-only members act as
sentinels of cellular stress throughout a cell and are regulated by
components of the RAS/MAPK and/or phosphatidylinositol
3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT pathways. BAD is a proapoptotic BH3-only
member of the Bcl-2 family of proteins that heterodimerizes with
and antagonizes prosurvival proteins, such as Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL.
This interaction triggers the release of cytochrome c from the mitochondria, which activates a caspase cascade leading to apoptosis
(7). Several kinases, including AKT, p70S6K, PKA, c-Jun NH2 kinase
(JNK), and RSK (a direct downstream target of ERK), have been

shown to phosphorylate and inactivate BAD, thereby promoting
survival (4, 9–13). In pancreatic cancer cells, RSK activates the
transcription factor cAMP-responsive element binding protein,
which promotes survival by increasing the expression of the
antiapoptotic proteins Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, and Mcl-1 (14). The proapoptotic
protein Bmf is transcriptionally repressed by both the RAS/MAPK
and PI3K/AKT pathways in breast cancer cells (15). In addition, ERK
directly phosphorylates the proapoptotic protein Bim, which leads to
its rapid degradation via the proteasome pathway (16, 17).
In this study, we classified a comprehensive panel of human
melanoma cell lines as either sensitive (z30% cell death) or
resistant (V30% cell death) to MEK inhibition to determine the
mechanism of resistance to cell death in this context. After MEK
inhibition, we compared the expression, activation, and subcellular
localization of Bcl-2 family members between resistant and
sensitive cell lines to identify potential differences.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture. Human melanoma cell lines C8161 (18) and CHL-1 [wildtype (wt) BRAF and NRAS; ref. 19], A375, C32, CACL, LOX-IMVI, M14-Mel,
MALME-3M, SK-MEL-5, SK-MEL-28, UACC-62, and UACC-257 (BRAF
mutants),5 and SK-MEL-2, SK-MEL-103, and SK-MEL-147 (NRAS mutants)
were cultured in RPMI 1640 (Life Technologies) supplemented with 5% fetal
bovine serum (Hyclone). Human neonatal epidermal melanocytes (Cascade
Biologics) were maintained in Medium 254 supplemented with melanocyte
growth factors (Cascade Biologics).
Reagents. The MEK inhibitor CI-1040 (PD184352) was obtained from
Pfizer Global Research and Development. PD98059, an additional MEK
inhibitor, was purchased from Cell Signaling Technology. The BH3 mimetic
ABT-737 along with an inactive control molecule was acquired from Abbott.
The caspase inhibitors Z-VAD-FMK, Z-DEVD-FMK, and Z-IETD-FMK were
purchased from Becton Dickinson. Drugs were dissolved in DMSO,
aliquoted, and stored at 20jC.
Drug treatments and cell viability. All cell viability assays were
initiated 24 h after melanocyte or melanoma cell line seeding and were
carried out for the times indicated. Single-treatment dosing with CI-1040
(2 Amol/L) was based on titration studies examining phosphorylated ERK
levels and minimal melanocyte toxicity. PD98059 required a daily dosing
schedule of 20 Amol/L to inhibit ERK phosphorylation. DMSO-treated
controls were vehicle control samples that were treated with an equal
volume of DMSO. Cell viability and apoptosis were verified by multiple
methods, including ViaCount (Guava Technologies), Annexin V binding
(Guava Technologies), cell cycle analysis with propidium iodide staining
(Roche), and 4¶,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole staining, as previously described
(5). Samples were prepared as per the manufacturers’ specifications at select
time points and assayed promptly. Experiments were done in triplicate, and
data are presented as mean F SE.
Subcellular fractionation. Initial mitochondrial and cytosolic fractionation was carried out with M14-MEL and SK-MEL-28 cells over 0, 48, and
72 h after CI-1040 treatment using a commercially available mitochondrial
isolation kit (Pierce). Subsequent cytosolic fractional isolations for
additional cell lines were carried out in a similar manner using the nuclear
and cytosolic fraction kit (BioVision) over multiple time points. Each
protocol was followed as per the manufacturers’ instructions, with the
exception of transferring the cell pellets to 2-mL microcentrifuge tubes after
the first centrifugation followed by washing the cell pellets thrice therein
with ice-cold PBS to adequately remove residual trypsin.
Western blotting. For direct immunoblot analysis, adherent and
nonadherent cells from each plate or well were lysed in SDS sample buffer
and boiled before SDS-PAGE. Protein concentration was determined using
the Bio-Rad Dc Protein Assay (Bio-Rad) as per the manufacturer’s

5

specifications. Typically, 30 Ag of protein were loaded per well in 4% to
20% gradient polyacrylamide gels (Invitrogren) and transferred onto
nitrocellulose (Bio-Rad). Equal volumes of 2 SDS sample buffer was
added to native lysates from subcellular fractions, followed by boiling and
SDS-PAGE, followed by immunoblotting. For a complete list of all
antibodies used, see supplementary data.
Stable Bmf and Bim constructs. V5 NH2 terminal–tagged and wt Bmf
and Bim were cloned from M14-Mel cells by reverse transcription–PCR
(RT-PCR) into pCR8/GW/TOPO (Invitrogen) and sequence verified with
Genbank NM_033503 for Bmf and Genbank NM_138621 for Bim. PCR-based
site-directed mutagenesis was used to generate Bmf mutants. Through
LR Clonase reactions (Invitrogen), these genes were then recombined into
a Gateway-compatible modified lentiviral vector, pDEST-FG12-cmv, for
subsequent expression analysis. The pDEST-FG12-cmv vector has been
described (20). This vector also harbors an independent GFP reporter gene,
allowing easy detection of infection efficiency. Lentiviral production and
infections were carried out as previously described (21). Viral gene delivery
was confirmed by Western blot analysis. Details regarding primer sequences,
cloning strategies, and lentiviral infection are available upon request.
Stable prosurvival Bcl-2 family member constructs. HA NH2
terminal–tagged and wt Bcl-xL and Bfl-1 were cloned from normal human
epidermal melanocyte (NHEM) cells by RT-PCR into pCR8/GW/TOPO
(Invitrogen) and sequence verified with Genbank NM_009743 for Bcl-xL
and Genbank NM_004049 for Bfl-1. Bcl-2 and Mcl-1 cDNAs (Origene) were
PCR amplified and cloned into pCR8/GW/TOPO (Invitrogen) and sequence
verified with Genbank NM_000633 for Bcl-2 and Genbank NM_021960 for Mcl1. These genes were then recombined into the pDEST-FG12-cmv lentiviral
vector using LR clonase (Invitrogen) for subsequent viral production,
infection, and stable expression (21). Infection efficiency was verified by
GFP expression, and gene expression was confirmed by Western blot analysis.
Primer sequences and cloning strategies are available upon request.
Stable Bmf and Bim short hairpin RNA constructs and Bad short
interfering RNA. Short 19-bp to 22-bp Bmf (Genbank NM_033503
nucleotides 326-344, 116-134, 213-235, and 393-414) and Bim (Genbank
NM_138621 nucleotides 436-454 and 820-841) specific oligos (IDT) were
annealed and cloned into the lentiviral vector KH1-LV (22), which contains an
H1 promoter and independent GFP expression driven by a ubiquitin C
promoter. An additional scrambled short hairpin RNA (shRNA) was designed
and used as a control. Subsequent viral production and infection efficiency
was verified by GFP expression, whereas stable shRNA potency was
determined by Western blot analysis. Short hairpin oligo sequences and
cloning strategies are available upon request. SMARTpools (5 Amol/L;
Dharmacon) targeting Bad were electroporated (200 V, 750 AF in Opti-MEM
medium) into 5  106 melanoma cells using a Gene Pulser II (Bio-Rad), and
knockdown was verified by Western blot at the times indicated.
RT-PCR analysis. RNA was isolated (Invitrogen) from CI-1040–treated
and untreated melanoma cell lines over times indicated. RT (Invitrogen) of
1 Ag of total RNA was followed by 25 cycles of PCR using glyceraldehyde-3phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) and Bmf specific primers (IDT). The
following primers were used to generate 425-bp (GAPDH) and 254-bp
(Bmf) fragments: GAPDH Fwd primer 5¶-CTACCCACGGCAAGTTCAAT-3¶,
GAPDH Rev primer 5¶-TACTCAGCACCAGCATCACC-3¶ and Bmf Fwd
primer 5¶-GGCTATCGGCTTCCTCTCCC-3¶, Bmf Rev primer 5¶-TCACCTAGGGCCTGCCCC-3¶.

Results
Melanoma cell lines exhibit variable sensitivity to the MEK
inhibitor PD184352 (CI-1040; Fig. 1A). It has been reported that
the response of melanoma cells to MEK inhibition is largely due to
BRAF (sensitive) and NRAS (resistant) mutation status (23, 24). To
define the mechanism underlying the variable apoptotic response
of melanoma cells to MEK inhibition, 15 human melanoma cell
lines, along with NHEM cells, were treated with the highly specific
small molecule MEK inhibitor CI-1040 (25, 26). NHEM and
melanoma cells that possess wt NRAS and BRAF are resistant

to the apoptotic effects of MAPK inhibition, whereas variable
apoptotic sensitivity was not significantly different between BRAF,
BRAF/PTEN, and NRAS mutant cell lines (Fig. 1A). CI-1040 potently
inhibited ERK phosphorylation for the duration of the study
(Fig. 1B). Although baseline phosphorylated ERK levels were
variable, there was no correlation between cell death and ERK
activation. CI-1040 promotes G1 cell cycle arrest in NHEM and
melanoma cells, followed by significant apoptosis in sensitive
melanoma cells by 72 hours (Fig. 1C).
Melanoma cells exhibit variable sensitivity to the BH3
mimetic ABT-737. It was previously reported that inactivation

www.aacrjournals.org

of the BH3-only protein Bad by MAPK signaling promotes
survival in melanoma cells (4). The small molecule BH3-mimetic
ABT-737 mimics Bad by binding to the same subset of Bcl-2
prosurvival proteins Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, and Bcl-w, but not Mcl-1 or Bfl-1
(27). Unlike Bad, however, ABT-737 cannot be inactivated by MAPK
signaling. Therefore, ABT-737 functions in a similar manner as
constitutively active Bad and was used to further evaluate the role
of Bad in promoting apoptosis in melanoma cells. ABT-737 dosing
was determined by single-agent titration ranging from 100 nmol/L
to 5 Amol/L on 10 melanoma cell lines for 72 hours. The
enantiomer (the stereoisomer having the mirror image of the

dimethylaminoethyl group) was used as a loss-of-function control
(27). The range wherein the enantiomer had negligible cytotoxic
effects and ABT-737 induced varying degrees of cytotoxicity was
between 1 and 2.5 Amol/L for most of the cell lines (Fig. 2A and
data not shown). Single and combination treatments with ABT-737
and the MEK inhibitor PD98059 were carried out with a final
concentration of 2.5 and 20 Amol/L, respectively. As a control, 2.5
Amol/L enantiomer was also tested, and the resulting cytotoxicity
was subtracted from the corresponding ABT-737–induced cytotoxicity. DMSO was used as a control for PD98059. ABT-737 exhibited
significant single-agent activity in many of the cell lines with >50%
cell death in CHL-1 and SK-MEL-103 (Fig. 2A). However, the
sensitivity profile for ABT-737 did not mirror that of the MEK
inhibitors. The CHL-1 cell line was highly resistant to MEK
inhibition but was sensitive to ABT-737, and the M14-MEL cell line
was highly sensitive to MEK inhibition but relatively resistant to
ABT-737. Whereas this shows that the apoptotic machinery is
intact and resistance to MEK inhibition is not due to defects in
the apoptotic pathway (e.g., loss of bak or bax functionality), it

suggests that cell death induced by MEK inhibition is not
mediated by the BH3-only protein Bad.
Apoptosis of melanoma cells induced by MEK inhibition
does not require the BH3-only protein Bad. To further examine
the requirement of Bad in apoptosis induced by MEK inhibition,
M14-MEL and MALME-3M cells were transfected with synthetic
short interfering RNA (siRNA) SMARTpools to specifically reduce
Bad expression by RNA interference (RNAi). Expression of Bad was
assessed by immunoblot analysis over time after transfection.
Levels of Bad protein were effectively reduced at >90% in both cell
lines by 120 hours posttransfection compared with the levels
expressed in cells transfected with the control siRNAs (Fig. 2B).
Cells were treated with CI-1040 48 hours after transfection and
assessed for cell death after 72 hours of treatment (120 hours after
transfection). Loss of Bad expression reduced apoptosis by only
f1.2-fold in both cell lines, suggesting that Bad is not required for
apoptosis induced by MEK inhibition in melanoma cells (Fig. 2B).
MEK inhibition leads to a dramatic increase in Bim levels
in all cell lines regardless of apoptotic sensitivity. To further

tightly regulate cell survival, in a subset of both sensitive

analysis of apoptotic regulatory factors in eight melanoma cell
lines treated with CI-1040 for 72 hours was carried out to
determine if alterations in any of these proteins correlated with
apoptotic sensitivity. Although expression of prosurvival factors
was highly variable among these cell lines, there was no correlation between expression and cell death (Fig. 3). Furthermore,
MEK inhibition did not affect the expression of Bcl-xL or Mcl-1.
Interestingly, Bcl-2 expression was increased in response to

MEK inhibition in several cell lines, but this expression did
not correlate with resistance. Additionally, IAP expression did
not influence apoptotic sensitivity (Fig. 3). High expression of
the proapoptotic multidomain proteins Bax and Bak was observed, suggesting that there is no disconnection with proximal death effectors in these melanoma cell lines. Upon MEK
inhibition, p53 responsive proapoptotic proteins Noxa and Puma h
expression is reduced in several cell lines (Fig. 3). ERK directly
phosphorylates and targets Bim for proteolytic degradation
(17), and as expected, inhibition of MEK and subsequent inhibition of ERK leads to a dramatic increase in Bim levels
(Fig. 3). Interestingly, active Bim is present in all cell lines in

response to MEK inhibition regardless of the amount of cell
death induced.
Comparative compartmental analysis between a sensitive
and resistant cell line reveals differences in Bmf localization.
Cellular localization of Bcl-2 family members may be more relevant to cell survival than overall expression, as many of these
proteins are inactivated through sequestration. To interrogate
possible differences between a CI-1040–sensitive (M14-MEL)
and CI-1040–resistant (SK-MEL-28) cell line, subcellular fractions
were collected from untreated and CI-1040–treated cells over time
and compared by immunoblot (Fig. 4A). Bim rapidly accumulates
to the outer mitochondrial membrane in both cell lines, but
cytosolic accrual of Bmf was exclusive to the sensitive M14-MEL
cell line (Fig. 4A). Analysis of whole-cell lysates revealed that
expression of Bmf remains relatively constant over time in each
cell line (Fig. 3). Whereas nearly all Bcl-2 family members were
analyzed in this context, only Bmf localization was dramatically
divergent. Further compartmental analysis of Bmf localization

in additional cell lines with variable apoptotic sensitivities revealed
that Bmf cytosolic localization correlated exquisitely with cell
death (Fig. 4B). Resistant cell lines, such as C8161 and SK-MEL-28,
retain Bmf in the cytoskeletal compartment. Conversely, Bmf is
released into the cytosolic fraction, which is proportional to levels
of apoptosis, in CI-1040–sensitive cell lines (Fig. 4B). Interestingly,
MEK inhibition results in enhanced Bmf transcription in melanoma cells, regardless of mutation status or apoptotic sensitivity
(Fig. 4C).
Apoptosis of melanoma cells induced by MEK inhibition
requires the BH3-only proteins Bim and Bmf. To further define
the roles of Bim and Bmf in promoting apoptosis, shRNAs were
stably expressed in melanoma cells using a lentiviral-mediated
approach. The KH1-LV lentivirus (22), which coexpresses GFP
driven by the UbC promoter, was VSV-G pseudotyped and used to
infect the sensitive cell line M14-MEL. Because Bim is not
detectable when MEK is active, levels of Bim were assessed in
the presence of MEK inhibition. Infected M14-MEL cells were

one shRNA target was used, but a pool of three shRNAs reduced
Bmf protein levels by 64% compared with the levels expressed in
cells infected with the control shRNA lentivirus (Fig. 5A). Reduced
expression of either Bim or Bmf dramatically reduced CI-1040–
directed apoptosis in these cells (Fig. 5A), whereas reduction of
other BH3-only proteins, such as Bad or Bid, did not (Fig. 2B and
data not shown). These data provide compelling evidence that both
Bim and Bmf are required for promoting apoptosis in response to
MEK inhibition in melanoma cells.
CI-1040–directed apoptosis shows partial caspase
dependence. Truncated Bid, an effector of the extrinsic apoptotic
pathway, was present in M14-MEL (Fig. 4A) and other sensitive cell
lines (data not shown) during active apoptosis. To determine the
relative contribution of the extrinsic pathway in promoting
apoptosis induced by MEK inhibition, caspase inhibitors with
differing specificities were used. The pan caspase inhibitor Z-VADFMK and the caspase-3–directed Z-DEVD-FMK provided doseresponsive protection from CI-1040–induced apoptosis (Fig. 5B),
whereas Z-IETD-FMK, the caspase-8 inhibitor, did not. This
suggests that apoptosis is primarily driven by the intrinsic pathway
and is dependent on caspase activation. In support of this, Bid
RNAi (data not shown) had no effect on CI-1040–induced apoptosis
in the three cell lines examined.
Bmf A69P confers CI-1040 sensitivity to resistant SK-MEL-28
cells. To assess the effect of Bim, Bmf, and BmfL138A overexpression
in M14-MEL and SK-MEL-28 cells, viral-mediated delivery was
done using the FG12-CMV lentivirus (20). Viral delivered V5 NH2
terminal–tagged Bim and Bmf or HA NH2 terminal–tagged Bcl-xL
and Mcl-1 in either cell line was expressed at high levels (Fig. 6A).
Despite high expression levels, neither Bim nor Bmf (wt or mutant)
overexpression induced cell death in either cell line in the absence
of CI-1040. Overxpression of Bim or Bmf had little overall effect on
cell death in the sensitive M14-MEL cell line (Fig. 6). Altering
critical amino acids in the BH3 domain (L138A) in Bmf diminishes
its ability to promote apoptosis (28). Overexpression of Bmf or
BmfL138A had no effect on cell death in SK-MEL-28 or M14-MEL
cells (Fig. 6). Release of Bmf from cytoskeletal components, such
as dynein light chain 2 (DLC2), is crucial for Bmf to promote
apoptosis (28, 29). To promote Bmf disassociation from DLC2, we
generated Bmf A69P(28) and Bmf A69P/L138A mutants and evaluated
their effect on cell death in response to MEK inhibition.
Overexpression of either Bmf mutant in the absence of CI-1040
had no effect on cell death (Fig. 6), but upon MEK inhibition, only
BmfA69P dramatically enhanced apoptosis in resistant SK-MEL-28
cells to a level comparable with the sensitive cell line M14-MEL
(Fig. 6A and B). Increased amounts of cleaved poly(ADP-ribose)
polymerase (PARP), an indicator of caspase-3 activation and
apoptosis, was observed in CI-1040–treated SK-MEL-28 cells
expressing BmfA69P compared with the same cells expressing wt
Bmf and was comparable with CI-1040–treated M14-MEL cells
(Fig. 6A). BmfA69P and BmfA69P/L138A mutants each localize to the
cytosolic fraction in SK-MEL-28 cells (data not shown), but the
BH3 domain impaired BmfA69P/L138A mutant does not promote
apoptosis. Therefore, the apoptotic effects of Bmf require
cytoskeletal disassociation and an intact BH3 domain.

Prosurvival Bcl-2 family member overexpression and
antagonism affect melanoma survival. To evaluate the contribution of Bcl-2 prosurvival members in resistance to MEK inhibition, lentiviral vectors (21, 22) were used to deliver and express
Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, Bfl-1, and Mcl-1. Overexpression of any of these
proteins in the sensitive cell line M14-MEL resulted in significant protection from apoptosis induced by CI-1040 at 72 hours
(Fig. 6 and data not shown). PARP cleavage was not observed in
Mcl-1 or Bcl-xL overexpressing cells (Fig. 6). Expression of Bcl-xL
in additional sensitive cell lines A375 and MALME-3M efficiently
abrogated apoptosis (data not shown). Apoptosis induced by MEK
inhibition is significantly enhanced by RNAi-mediated reduction in
Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, or Mcl-1 levels in SK-MEL-103 and SK-MEL-147 cells
(21). This shows that these cell lines can effectively disseminate
intrinsic apoptotic signals when the protective effects of Bcl-2
prosurvival members are removed. However, because no correlation between endogenous expression (Fig. 3) and apoptotic

sensitivity was observed, it is unlikely that these proteins are
responsible for the variable sensitivity to MEK inhibition observed
in melanoma cells (Fig. 1A).

Discussion
By analyzing a large panel of melanoma cells with varying
sensitivity to MEK inhibition, we have identified a role for the
proapoptotic BH3-only protein Bmf in promoting cell death in
response to MEK inhibition. Striking differences in Bmf activation
and localization distinguished sensitive and resistant cell lines
exquisitely. Unlike Bmf, Bim translocation to the outer mitochondrial membrane occurred in all melanoma cell lines regardless of
sensitivity or resistance to MEK inhibition. Interestingly, both Bmf
and Bim are necessary but not sufficient to promote significant
apoptosis. These data suggest that strategies that induce the
activation of additional proapoptotic proteins or those designed to
abrogate the protective effects of most of the prosurvival proteins
are more likely to achieve success in combination with MEK
inhibition in melanoma.
There has been considerable debate regarding the mechanism
underlying variable apoptotic sensitivity of melanoma cells to MEK
inhibition, most notably NRAS or BRAF mutation status. Recently,
it was reported that the IC50 values of current generation MEK
inhibitors were substantially lower in BRAF mutant melanoma cell

lines compared with those harboring activating NRAS mutations,
suggesting that mutation status is predictive of response (24). We
analyzed the apoptotic response of an inclusive melanoma cell line
panel in the presence of complete MEK inhibition for the duration
of our studies (Fig. 4B). The results show that the apoptotic
sensitivity of melanoma cells correlates with Bmf subcellular
translocation in response to MEK inhibition regardless of NRAS or
BRAF mutation status. Interestingly, treating this cell line panel
with doses of CI-1040 that resulted in only modest reductions in
ERK phosphorylation yielded no cell death even in the most
sensitive cell lines (data not shown). Additionally, removal of CI1040 treatment after 24 hours allows all cell lines to completely
recover and avert cell death. Recent evidence indicates that Bim
is quickly phosphorylated and degraded in response to MAPK
reactivation (16). Collectively, it is essential to completely block
MEK/ERK signaling for a significant amount of time (e.g., 48–
96 hours) to elicit efficient cell death. However, the most resistant
cell lines (e.g., C8161 and SK-MEL-28) remain viable even after
144 hours of continuous MEK inhibition (data not shown).
A recent study using the MEK inhibitors U0126 and CI-1040
found that, whereas phosphorylated ERK may be a valid marker for
assessing MEK inhibition, it did not correlate with inhibition of
melanoma cell growth or BRAF mutational status (18). A separate
study using anthrax lethal toxin–induced MEK inhibition reported
that melanoma cells harboring mutant BRAF are more sensitive

Bmf Mediates Apoptosis Induced by MEK Inhibition

compared with those containing mutant NRAS. However, there
were exceptions to this finding, as two mutant BRAF cell lines,
SK-MEL-5 and A2058, had similar levels of sensitivity as the NRAS
mutant cells and a cell line for wt BRAF, SK-MEL-31, was highly
sensitive to MEK inhibition (23). In addition, SK-MEL-5 and SKMEL-28 are highly resistant to apoptosis induced by anthrax lethal
toxin (5), which is similar to what we observed with CI-1040.
Previous studies have suggested that inactivation of the BH3-only
protein Bad by MAPK signaling promotes survival in melanoma
cells and that interfering with this signaling may represent a tumorspecific target (4). Our findings indicate that Bim and Bmf, but not
Bad or Bid, are functionally required to induce apoptosis after MEK
inhibition. It has previously been reported that Bim, Bid, and Puma
bind all of the prosurvival proteins, whereas the remaining BH3only proteins are more restricted. Whereas Bad and Bmf were
reported to only interact with Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, and Bcl-w (30), recent
data suggests that Bmf can also interact with Mcl-1 and Bfl-1, albeit
with different affinities (8, 31). Furthermore, Bmf was first identified
in a screen for binding partners to Mcl-1, and the BH3 domain in
Bmf is most similar to that in Bim (28).
Several studies have described a role for Bim and Bmf in cell
death mediated by specific processes. For example, Bmf has
been reported to play a role in apoptosis mediated by histone
deacetylase inhibitors (32) and both Bim and Bmf are implicated in
the cell death response to transforming growth factor-h (33) and
arsenic treatment (34). In addition, Bim and Bmf play key roles in
mammary epithelial anoikis and morphogenesis (15). Here, we
show that Bim and Bmf mediate cell death in response to MEK
inhibition in melanoma. Interestingly, RNAi targeting either Bim or
Bmf is sufficient to rescue cells from cell death in some models,
whereas reduction in both proteins is required to significantly
suppress apoptosis in other systems. These discrepancies are likely
due to differences in cell types and/or expression of prosurvival
Bcl-2 family members.
Expression of the p53-responsive BH3-only protein Puma has
been reported to be reduced during melanoma progression and low
Puma expression correlates with poor prognosis (35). Whereas no
significant difference in Puma expression was observed between
cell lines, loss or reduced expression occurred over the CI-1040
treatment time course (Figs. 2 and 3). Additionally, expression of
another p53-responsive BH3-only protein Noxa is dramatically
reduced or lost upon CI-1040 treatment. Taken together, these data
suggest that these proteins play little or no role in sensitivity or
resistance to MEK inhibition, as their expression is reduced upon
MEK inhibition. However, it is probable that these active BH3-only
proteins are responsible for apoptosis induced by ABT-737.
Two distinct models of how BH3-only proteins induce apoptosis
have been proposed (36, 37). Whereas it is accepted that Bax or Bak
are required for cell death, it is unclear whether BH3-only proteins
activate Bax or Bak directly or indirectly. Our results are consistent
with the direct activation model that requires a functional activator
(Bim) and sensitizer (Bmf) BH3-only pair to induce apoptosis. Bim
activation occurs rapidly and robustly upon MEK inhibition in all
cell lines examined regardless of the level of apoptosis induced

(Figs. 3 and 4), but cell death occurs only when an additional BH3only member (Bmf) is concurrently active. Bim and Bmf RNAi data
are supportive of this model, because reducing the expression of
either one dramatically blocks cell death (Fig. 5A). Bim binds to
and antagonizes all Bcl-2 prosurvival members, whereas Bmf binds
to a smaller subset with different affinity (8). Further investigation
may distinguish which model, if either, is correct.
Our results suggest that a MEK-independent mechanism of
retaining Bmf in the cytoskeletal compartment (e.g., DLC2) is
lacking in the sensitive melanoma cell lines and is a major
contributing factor to apoptosis that is directed by MEK inhibition.
Several kinases, including JNK1 (MAPK8), have been implicated in
the regulation and sequestration of Bmf to DLC2 (38). Combined
targeting of these kinases or upstream components with MEK
inhibition may expand the utility of MAPK as a therapeutic target.
Single-agent MEK inhibition must be nearly complete to initiate
apoptosis in even the most sensitive cell lines. Results from earlyphase clinical trials have shown that tolerable doses of current
generation MEK inhibitors PD 0325901 and AZD6244 reduce
phosphorylated ERK levels at f84% and f79%, respectively
(39, 40). Additionally, the greatest tumor reduction (70%) in a
melanoma patient, whose tumor contained an NRAS mutation, had
undetectable phosphorylated ERK levels in the tumor after
sustained daily AZD6244 treatment (39). Complete and sustained
MEK inhibition is unlikely to be achieved unilaterally in vivo due to
an increase in frequency and severity of side effects upon dose
escalation and bioavailability of these inhibitors in organs in which
melanoma commonly metastasizes (e.g., brain and liver). Therefore,
by understanding the mechanism driving cell death in response to
MEK inhibition in melanoma, logical combinatorial therapies can
be developed. Consistent with this idea, a novel BH3 mimetic,
TW-37, which binds Mcl-1, Bcl-xL, and Bcl-2, in combination with
CI-1040, showed synergy in a MEK inhibitor–resistant melanoma
cell line in vivo (21). Despite its inability to antagonize Mcl-1, which
all of the melanoma cell lines examined express (Fig. 3), ABT-737
had a relatively high single-agent activity in this panel of melanoma
cell lines, and when combined with a less potent MEK inhibitor
(PD98059), cell death was enhanced (Fig. 2). Our results provide
new insights into how MEK inhibition induces apoptosis in
melanoma cells. Future studies will determine the mechanism by
which Bmf remains sequestered in melanoma cells resistant to
MEK inhibition.
