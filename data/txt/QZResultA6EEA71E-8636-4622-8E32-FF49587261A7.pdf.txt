DUSP1 Phosphatase Regulates the Proinﬂammatory Milieu
in Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma
Xiaoyi Zhang1, J. Madison Hyer2, Hong Yu1, Nisha J. D'Silva3, and Keith L. Kirkwood1

Abstract
DUSP1 is a dual-speciﬁcity phosphatase that regulates mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase activity.
Studies have associated loss of DUSP1 expression with certain cancers, but there has been no report of a
mechanism by which this supports tumor progression. In this study, we found DUSP1 mRNA and protein
decreased in human head and neck squamous cell carcinoma tissues compared with adjacent nontumor
controls. To evaluate the impact of this difference, we compared the susceptibility of Dusp1-deﬁcient mice with
oral squamous carcinogenesis induced by 4-nitroquinoline 1-oxide. Dusp1-deﬁcient mice displayed enhanced
disease progression, characterized by advanced onset, histologic stage, and tumor burden. In a syngeneic model
of tumor progression, subcutaneous injection of EO771 cells formed faster-growing tumors in Dusp1-deﬁcient
mice, an effect abrogated by inhibition of p38 MAP kinase with SB203580. Histologic and quantitative
assessments demonstrated increased inﬂammation and deregulated chemokine and cytokine expression in
Dusp1-deﬁcient tumor tissues. Speciﬁcally, proinﬂammatory cytokine IL1b was elevated. IL1b production was
recapitulated ex vivo in primary bone marrow–derived macrophages from Dusp1-deﬁcient mice. Together, our
results clearly establish the role of Dusp1 as a tumor suppressor gene that regulates cancer-associated
inﬂammation. Cancer Res; 74(24); 7191–7. 2014 AACR.

Introduction
Inﬂammatory cells and their secreted products inﬂuence
cancer cell growth, angiogenesis, tissue remodeling, and more
(1). Chronic inﬂammation is known to enhance neoplastic
processes, as in gastrointestinal and hepatocellular carcinomas (2). However, in other tumor types including head and
neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), studies have identiﬁed immunosuppressive states characterized by inﬁltrating
regulatory T and myeloid-derived suppressor cells (3). This
dichotomy between enhanced protumorigenic inﬂammation
and suppressed antitumor immunity highlights the need to
understand complex functions of inﬂammatory cells in the
tumor microenvironment and identify therapeutic targets in
these distinctive pathways.

pathways by dephosphorylating p38 and JNK MAPKs (4).
Dusp1-deﬁcient mice are highly susceptible to immune challenge, such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in sepsis and inﬂammatory bone loss models, due to prolonged MAPK activity and
exuberant cytokine production (5, 6). In bladder, prostate, and
colon cancers, Dusp1 expression is elevated in early stages of
disease, but lost in a majority of poorly differentiated and
metastatic tissues (7). In the present study, we assess the
impact of Dusp1 deﬁciency in a murine model of carcinogen-induced oral cancer. Tumor progression was also
enhanced in a syngeneic subcutaneous injection of breast
cancer cells, rescued by p38 inhibition. Increased susceptibility
and disease burden of Dusp1-deﬁcient mice, in addition to
development of a highly inﬂammatory microenvironment,
suggest DUSP1 plays a key role in negatively regulating
tumor-associated inﬂammation, in part through expression
of the inﬂammatory cytokine IL1b. To our knowledge, this is
the ﬁrst study to demonstrate a tumor suppressive role of
DUSP1.

Materials and Methods
Animal models
Protocols were approved by Medical University of South
Carolina (MUSC) Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Male and female Dusp1/ and Dusp1þ/þ mice of
C57/129 mixed genetic background, ages 6- to 8-week-old,
and weighing 18 to 22 g were treated with 4-nitroquinlone 1oxide (4NQO), as previously described (8). Animals were
euthanized at week 32 or when greater than 20% weight loss

was documented. Dusp1/ and Dusp1þ/þ mice backcrossed to C57BL/6 background for 10 generations were
used for subcutaneous syngeneic tumor cell injections. Mice
ages 6 to 8 weeks received 5  105 EO771 cells in 100 mL PBS
in a subcutaneous injection over the right ﬂank. Tumor
volume (l  w2/2) was measured with digital calipers every
two days, and animals were euthanized if tumor size
exceeded 1,500 mm3. After tumors reached >50 mm3 (day
7), animals received daily intraperitoneal injections of 5
mg/kg SB203580 or dimethylsulfoxide vehicle.
Histologic and FACS analyses
Formalin-ﬁxed parafﬁn-embedded tissues were used for
histology and immunohistochemistry. Two pathologists,
blinded to experimental group, evaluated sections for
pathology and inﬂammation. Inﬂammation was scored on
a 0 to 4 scale [0, normal mucosa; 1, minimal inﬂammation
(occasional scattered granulocytes and leukocytes); 2, mild
inﬂammation (scattered granulocytes with occasional inﬁltrates); 3, moderate inﬂammation (scattered granulocytes
with patchy inﬁltrates); and 4, severe inﬂammation (multiple extensive areas with abundant granulocytes and
marked inﬁltrates)], as previously described (9).
Immunohistochemistry was performed in EDTA antigen
retrieval buffer, as previously described (6), using antibodies against CD11b (Abcam), F4/80 (Abcam), and Ly6G
(Novus Biologicals). DAB-positive cells in tumor-positive
ﬁelds of view were acquired at 10 magniﬁcation and
quantiﬁed using Viziopharm acquisition and analysis software, and expressed as the number of positive cells in each
histologically deﬁned area. Single-cell suspensions were
generated from spleen and cervical lymph nodes from
tumor-bearing mice for ﬂow cytometry. Cells were stained
according to manufacturer's protocol against CD11b-APC,
Ly6C-FITC, Ly6G-Paciﬁc Blue, and F4/80-PE with at least
10,000 events analyzed by Miltenyi MACSQuant cytometer
and software.
Primary bone marrow–derived macrophage isolation
Bone marrow cells were obtained from 8- to 12-week-old
mice, as previously described (6). Macrophages were primed
with LPS from Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans
(strain Y4, serotype B) followed by treatment with ATP or
nigericin (Sigma-Aldrich), as previously described (10).
Human tissue samples
Snap-frozen tissues from patients with HNSCC were
acquired from MUSC Hollings Cancer Center Tissue Biorepository, according to protocols approved by MUSC Institutional
Review Board. Tissue pathology and tumor percentage within
representative frozen sections were veriﬁed by Biorepository
research pathology.
Western blotting
Tissue and cell lysates were processed as previously
described (11). Primary antibodies were directed against
DUSP1 (Millipore), caspase 1 p20 (Millipore) and p10 (Santa

Cruz Biotechnology), IL1b (Abcam), GAPDH, and a-tubulin
(Cell Signaling Technology). Secondary antibodies were horseradish peroxidase–conjugated anti-rabbit antibodies (Cell Signaling Technology).
Gene expression
Gene expression was determined using probe-primer TaqMan sets for delta-delta Ct calculations: Ptprc, IL1b, Gapdh,
16s rRNA, DUSP1, and ACTB. The nCounter analysis system
(NanoString Technologies) was used to quantify gene expression in a custom panel. Each sample proﬁle was normalized
to geometric mean of four reference genes, Eif4a2, Oaz1, Ncln,
and Gfra2, chosen for lowest variance across experimental
samples.
Statistical analyses
For matched human tissues, a paired t test was performed.
When comparing effect of genotype, a two-sample t test was
performed using the Satterthwaite method for unequal
variances, Mann–Whitney U test in absence of normal
distribution, or pooled method for all other comparisons.
For distributions of categorical scores, a Fischer exact test
was used. A repeated measures mixed model, with random
intercept and time effect, was used to test effect of genotype
on weight gain and inhibitor treatment by genotype interaction. Survival analyses (event ¼ tumor volume  1,500
mm3) with Kaplan–Meier estimates were performed using a
log-rank test. Adjusted P values using Tukey–Kramer multiple comparisons method are provided when comparing
least square mean estimates. All analyses were performed
using SAS 9.4.

Results and Discussion
DUSP1 expression is decreased in HNSCC samples
DUSP1 mRNA and protein expression were lost in human
oral squamous cell carcinomas compared with adjacent nontumor control tissues (Fig. 1A and B). These ﬁndings were
consistent with reports of DUSP1 downregulation or loss in
other cancers (7). Expression of the proform of IL1b, an mRNA
previously identiﬁed in salivary exosomes from patients with
oral cancer (12), was also elevated in eight of the eleven pairs of
HNSCC tissues (Fig. 1B).
Dusp1 deﬁciency enhances susceptibility to carcinogeninduced oral cancer
The development of cancer results from the interplay
between genomic alterations, such as those induced by
carcinogen exposure, and a supportive tumor microenvironment. To understand how DUSP1 deﬁciency alters oral
cancer development and progression, wild-type and Dusp1deﬁcient mice were subjected to a carcinogen-induced oral
cancer model, previously optimized to generate heterogeneous oral lesions that evolve into squamous cell carcinomas (8). This model has been described as generating little
inﬂammation with low levels of COX-2 expression and
stromal inﬁltrate in C57BL/6 mice at the time of invasive
SCC development (8, 13). However, these studies propose an

inﬂammatory microenvironment develops in response to
carcinogen-induced oral tumorigenesis, enhanced by Dusp1
downregulation, to promote disease progression. Although
Dusp1-deﬁcient mice are more susceptible to innate
immune activation in sepsis and other models of acute
inﬂammation (5, 6), its phenotype in tumorigenesis is not
well deﬁned.
Animals were exposed to 4NQO, a surrogate for chronic
tobacco exposure, in drinking water for 16 weeks, and
monitored for development of oral lesions (Fig. 2A).

Change in weight, as an estimate of disease burden, was
reduced in Dusp1-deﬁcient mice over time (Fig. 2B). Wildtype mice continued to gain weight, from 10 to 15 weeks,
whereas weight gain in Dusp1-deﬁcient mice stopped
by 10 weeks, likely due to increasing tumor burden.
Disease onset was accelerated in Dusp1-deﬁcient mice by
2 to 3 weeks (Supplementary Fig. S1). No difference in
weight gain was noted in Dusp1-deﬁcient mice in vehicle
treatment group compared with wild-type controls (Supplementary Fig. S2). At 32 weeks, signiﬁcant elevation of

Wild-type mice lesions were distributed across the spectrum of hyperplasia, dysplasia, and in situ and invasive
squamous cell carcinomas, whereas the majority of Dusp1deﬁcient lesions were invasive squamous cell carcinomas
(Fig. 2D).

Dusp1 deﬁciency enhances tumor-associated

Enhanced leukocyte abundance was observed, both histologically and by Ptprc gene expression in Dusp1-deﬁcient
mice (Fig. 3A). Nanostring analysis of tumor tissues did not
reveal signiﬁcant perturbations in markers of cellular inﬁltrate but suggested increased M2 macrophage polarization

DUSP1 Regulates Inﬂammation in HNSCC

(Supplementary Fig. S3). Ex vivo analysis of primary bone
marrow–derived macrophages from Dusp1-deﬁcient mice
did not reveal an intrinsic defect in M1 polarization or
predilection toward M2 polarization (data not shown).
Notably, mRNA levels of cytokines and chemokines Il1b,
Vegf, Cxcl1, Cxcl2, Ccl2, and receptor Ccr5 were highly
elevated in Dusp1-deﬁcient tissues, suggestive of predominantly monocyte-macrophage inﬁltrate (Fig. 3B). Immunohistochemistry of tumor tissues identiﬁed a signiﬁcance
increase in Ly6G-positive inﬁltrates with a trend toward
increased Cd11b-positive cells, and no difference in F4/80
expression (Fig. 3C). Flow cytometry analysis of spleen and
draining lymph nodes identiﬁed similar increases in Cd11bpositive cells with Ly6C and/or Ly6G expression.
To determine whether stromal Dusp1 deﬁciency enhances
tumor progression, subcutaneous injections of the syngeneic
breast adenocarcinoma EO771 cell line were implanted in
wild-type and Dusp1-deﬁcient female mice. Analysis of
microarray datasets of human breast cancer tissues revealed
patients, stratiﬁed into low DUSP1 expression, had signiﬁcantly decreased progression-free survival (Supplementary
Fig. S4). Tumors in Dusp1-deﬁcient animals grew more
rapidly than in wild-type animals, an effect abrogated by
treatment with the p38 inhibitor SB203580 (Fig. 3D). Furthermore, survival was signiﬁcantly decreased in Dusp1deﬁcient animals, rescued by inhibitor treatment (Fig.
3D). Inhibitor treatment did not have a signiﬁcant effect
on tumor growth or survival in wild-type animals. These
data demonstrate Dusp1 expression has a crucial tumor
suppressive role in regulating stromal p38 MAPK activity
and suggest downstream effects of its loss in HNSCC and
other cancers are mediated through increased expression of
inﬂammatory mediators.
Dusp1 deﬁciency increases IL1b expression
A pair of tumor tissues from Dusp1-deﬁcient and wildtype mice, matched for histologic stage and inﬂammation
score, were analyzed by targeted qPCR array to assess
expression levels of 89 cytokines, chemokines, and receptors.
The initial screen showed Il1b elevated 70-fold in the Dusp1deﬁcient sample (data not shown), then validated by qPCR
in a larger set of tissues (Fig. 4A). Western blot analyses of
caspase-1 and Il1b demonstrate high levels of both protein
proforms, likely secondary to increased inﬂammatory inﬁltrate and Il1b transcript abundance in Dusp1-deﬁcient mice
(Fig. 4B). A strength of 4NQO exposure is its mirroring of
human cancer progression from hyperplasia to invasive
squamous cell carcinoma. In this model, Dusp1-deﬁcient
mice demonstrate accelerated tumorigenesis with increased
inﬂammation and provide ﬁrst evidence for a mechanistic
link between loss of DUSP1 expression and advanced disease
progression. Although a panel of increased cytokines and
chemokines was identiﬁed by qPCR and Nanostring analyses, IL1b may be a major contributor, particularly in HNSCC
as previously suggested in patient and in vitro studies
(14, 15). The broad impact of Dusp1 deﬁciency on tumor
progression in this model highlights the utility in identifying
an upstream regulator of protumorigenic inﬂammatory

response for therapeutic targeting with greater impact than
biologics against a single cytokine.
Treatment of primary bone marrow–derived macrophages from Dusp1-deﬁcient mice with LPS (100 ng/mL)
resulted in signiﬁcantly increased levels of Il1b mRNA
(Fig. 4C). Despite the striking level of procaspase-1 detected
in Dusp1-deﬁcient tumor tissues, no signiﬁcant elevation of
caspase-1 expression or cleavage product was detected
in primary cultures (Fig. 4D). This discrepancy may be due
to differences in cellular constituents of tumor tissues
between wild-type and Dusp1-deﬁcient mice, as suggested
by the increased numbers of inﬂammatory cells by histologic scoring and immunohistochemistry (Fig. 3), which can
be normalized in ex vivo culture systems of primary
macrophages.

Conclusions
Loss of DUSP1 expression has implications on biologic
activities of many tumor cellular constituents, which are
not fully dissected in these experiments. A recent survey of
over 400 human HNSCC tissues revealed highly elevated
p38 MAPK activity in nearly 80% of cases, with signiﬁcant
impact on cancer cell growth, lymphangiogenesis, and
angiogenesis in xenograft studies (16). Immunohistochemistry of 4NQO-induced tumors in both wild-type and Dusp1deﬁcient mice shows the same trend of elevated expression
of phospho-p38 but not ERK1/2 nor SAPK/JNK MAPKs
in tumor epithelial tissues (Supplementary Fig. S5). No
differences in phospho-p38 staining were seen in wild type
of Dusp1-deﬁcient tumor despite altered MAPK activity
and expression in immunoblots of whole tissue lysates
(Supplementary Fig. S6), suggesting a more critical role
of MAPK signaling in supporting stromal and immune
cells. Furthermore, in a syngeneic model, inhibition of
p38 by SB203580 signiﬁcantly decreased tumor cell growth
in Dusp1-deﬁcient mice but not wild-type animals. Differential contributions of DUSP1 signaling in inﬁltrating
immune cells versus supporting stromal cells, such as
ﬁbroblasts and endothelial cells, must be addressed in
future studies.
Although numerous reports have identiﬁed downregulation
of DUSP1 across diverse tumor tissues, this is the ﬁrst study to
demonstrate a tumor suppressive role. Results from these in
vivo and ex vivo studies also highlight a mechanism for upregulation of proinﬂammatory cytokine Il1b in oral cancer,
previously shown to be elevated as mRNA in salivary exosomes
(12) and secreted protein (14). Using a model mimicking
genetic heterogeneity of human HNSCC following long-term
carcinogen exposure, these ﬁndings support Il1b's role as
potential biomarker. Additional work must be done to address
its impact on disease progression.
In light of cytokine and chemokine ﬁndings discussed
above, implications of these studies may extend well
beyond HNSCC, as DUSP1 expression has been shown to
be dysregulated in other cancers, such as breast, and may
be predictive of response to targeted therapies, such as
cetuximab (7, 17). Genomic studies have not identiﬁed a

hypermethylation in over 80% of oral cancer tissues (18).
Pharmaceutical intervention to induce DUSP1 expression,
with rosiglitazone and mapracorat, is currently being
explored in vitro with promising results (19, 20). In summary, results presented here demonstrate for the ﬁrst time

7196

Cancer Res; 74(24) December 15, 2014

that DUSP1 plays an important role within the tumor
microenvironment, regulating key cytokines such as Il1b.
Downregulation of DUSP1 leads to enhanced disease progression. Thus, restoring DUSP1 expression represents a
promising target of pharmacologic intervention and merits
further investigation as a suppressor of tumor-promoting
inﬂammation.
