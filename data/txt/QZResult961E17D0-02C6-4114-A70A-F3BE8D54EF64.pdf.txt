ABSTRACT
Malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) is a very aggressive form of cancer with
a poor diagnosis and prognosis. The first line treatment for MPM is a combination of
cisplatin and Pemetrexed, which displayed limited efficacy and severe side effects.
The naturally occurring compound phenethyl isothiocyanate (PEITC) previously
showed interesting anti-tumor properties on several cancer cell lines. We thus aim
at evaluating PEITC used alone or in combination with cisplatin in order to improve
MPM treatment.
Nine MPM cell lines and primary mesothelial cells (PMC), co-cultured or not with
M2 macrophages present in MPM microenvironment, were used to assess PEITC and
cisplatin anti-tumor properties. Compounds were used alone or in combination.
Both PEITC and cisplatin were cytotoxic on MPM cells in a dose dependent
manner. We herein showed that PEITC-induced cytotoxicity was due to the generation
of reactive oxygen species. Moreover, we showed that cisplatin-PEITC combination
allowed the potentialization of both compounds’ cytotoxic effects and prevented
the emergence of resistant MPM cells. Interestingly, PMC were not sensitive to
the combination. Finally, we showed that M2 macrophages did not alter the antitumor properties of the combination. Cisplatin-PEITC combination thus represents a
promising strategy to induce a selective toxicity towards malignant cells.

INTRODUCTION

half of the patients respond to the combination [6]. It is
thus necessary to find new therapeutic approaches to treat
MPM.
It has now been described for many years that
frequent consumption of cruciferous vegetables reduces
the incidence of cancer [7]. The active compounds
primarily responsible for those cancer chemopreventive
properties were described to be the glucosinolates [8-9],
which are substituted B-thioglucoside N-hydroxysulfates
synthesized by the plant from 8 amino acids. However, the
inhibition of carcinogenesis seems to rather be attributable
to some of their breakdown products: the isothiocyanates
(ITCs) [10].
ITCs anticarcinogenic properties mechanisms

Malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) is an
aggressive neoplasm affecting the mesothelial surfaces
of pleural and peritoneal cavities [1] mainly arising from
a chronic exposure to and inhalation of asbestos [2]. Its
aggressiveness and critical health care matter mainly
arise from its late diagnosis and poor prognosis (less
than a year after diagnosis). The first line treatment for
MPM lies in the combination of cisplatin with an antimetabolite: the Pemetrexed (Alimta). There are several
clinical trials relating this combination to treat MPM [34], that lead to better response compared to cisplatin alone
[5]. However, this improvement remains modest and only

of action are still under investigation but it is now
established that it stems from their ability to disrupt
multiple carcinogenic process step. They were shown to
reduce genetic damage, inhibit genetically damaged cell
proliferation thanks to the induction of apoptosis and cell
cycle arrest, but were also involved in malignant cells
differentiation [11-12]. These anti-tumor effects may be
due to the generation of Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS)
that was previously reported to be one of Benzyl ITC
(BITC) mechanisms of action [13-14].
In animal models, more than 20 ITCs were shown
to inhibit carcinogenesis induced by several chemical
carcinogens [11,15]. In human, it has been reported that
those vegetables are good protective agents against several
kinds of cancer: colorectal [16], lung [17] and possibly
prostate cancers [18]. Among all ITCs, it was shown in
vivo that Phenethyl Isothiocyanate (PEITC) was able to
reach the highest plasma concentration after oral ingestion
[19], at a micromolar dose range. Interestingly, micromolar
doses of PEITC applied to animal and cell culture
models were shown to prevent cancer, through several
mechanisms that still need to be further investigated
[10,20]. We thus wondered whether combining cisplatin
with PEITC could be of potential therapeutic benefits for
patients suffering from MPM, and if it could lead to less
side effects and more specificity on cancer cells.
For these purposes, we focused on the anti-tumor
properties of PEITC alone or in combination with cisplatin
on a large collect of MPM cell lines freshly established
from patients’ pleural effusions in our laboratory. We
demonstrated for the first time that PEITC is cytotoxic
for MPM cells through ROS production. Moreover,
cisplatin-PEITC combination allowed potentialization
of both compounds’ cytotoxic effects and prevented the
emergence of resistant MPM cells. Interestingly, healthy
primary mesothelial cells (PMC) were not sensitive to the
combination. Finally, the presence of M2 macrophages did
not change the anti-tumor properties of the combination.
Our results suggest that cisplatin-PEITC combination
could be of great interest for MPM treatment.

in PEITC-induced cell death. Indeed, ROS production
would be inhibited by NAC treatment. Cell cytotoxicity
with PEITC treatment was increased in a dose-dependent
manner, and PEITC had a similar potency on all cell
lines. The IC50 value was 7.4 ± 0.2µM for MPM cell lines
(Figure 1A). PEITC-induced cytotoxicity was inhibited by
a co-treatment with NAC, suggesting the implication of
ROS production in this effect.
Then, PEITC-induced ROS in MPM cells was
investigated to determine whether it could be part of the
mechanisms involved in cytotoxic effects on cancer cells.
Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) has very strong oxidizing
properties and was used as a positive control for ROS
production. Cell death induction was measured with
Annexin-V cells staining (Figure 1B). ROS production
was assessed by flow cytometry thanks to cells preincubation with the CM-H2DCFA specific fluorescent
probe (Figure 1C).We observed, in a dose-dependent
manner, that PEITC-induced ROS generation was
consistent with PEITC-induced cell death in all tested cell
lines (Figure 1B and C). In the presence of NAC, ROS
generation and cell cytotoxicity were decreased, strongly
suggesting the causative link between ROS generation and
PEITC-induced cell death. As a control, H2O2 was shown
to induce apoptosis and ROS production in MPM cells.

Cisplatin increases MPM cells cytotoxicity partly
in a ROS dependent manner
Several studies demonstrated the implication of an
oxidative stress generation in cisplatin cytotoxic effects
[24]. Thus, cisplatin dose-response experiments were
carried out on the same three MPM cell lines previously
tested. All cell lines were sensitive to cisplatin in a dose
dependent manner. The IC50 value was 1.8 ± 0.21mg/L
for MPM cell lines (Figure 2A). Treatment with NAC
decreased cisplatin-induced cell cytotoxicity on all tested
cell lines, arising from the possible induction of ROS by
cisplatin.
To confirm the implication of an oxidative stress in
the cytotoxic effect of cisplatin, we similarly investigated
whether cisplatin induced-cell death is related to a ROS
production and inhibited by NAC (Figures 2B and C).
However, cisplatin-induced cell death did not entirely
correlate with a production of ROS. Indeed, although
almost 40% of cells died from a treatment with the highest
concentration of cisplatin (25mg/L) (Figure 2B), yet no
production of ROS was detected (Figure 2C). Cells cotreated with cisplatin (25mg/L) and NAC seemed to be
more resistant to death than those untreated with NAC:
almost 40% of cells died with cisplatin alone while
about 23% of MPM cells died with the combination.
As a control, H2O2 induced ROS production and MPM
cell death. H2O2 effects were totally inhibited by a cotreatment with NAC, demonstrating its efficacy to block
ROS-induced cell death.

RESULTS
PEITC increases MPM cells cytotoxicity through
ROS production
PEITC was previously demonstrated to exert
cytotoxic effects on tumor cells by increasing ROS
intracellular level [23]. In order to evaluate the antitumor
properties of PEITC, cell cytotoxic assays were conducted
on three MPM cell lines: Meso4, Meso11, Meso152,
treated with increasing doses of PEITC alone or in
combination with NAC, a powerful antioxidant amino
acid. NAC was used to highlight the implication of ROS

Cisplatin-PEITC combination potentiates their
cytotoxic effect through enhanced DNA damage

Both compounds were used alone or in combination on
MPM cells seeded in 96 well plates. Three concentrations
of PEITC were evaluated, and cisplatin concentration
(0.8mg/L) was used to trigger approximately 40%
of cell death (Figure 4A). MPM cell lines died in a
dose dependant manner for all PEITC concentrations.
Cell death was significantly enhanced with combined
compounds after 72h at all PEITC concentrations. It was
the most obvious with the 6µM PEITC concentration, as
there was almost 80% of cell death with the combination,
when each compound alone only induced about 40%
of cell death. Cisplatin-PEITC combination cytotoxic
effect on MPM cells was also assessed over 10 days
using a clonogenic assay (Figure 4B). Cells were seeded
at a small density and treated for 10 days with PEITC
and cisplatin alone or in combination. Previous doseresponse experiments allowed us to choose an appropriate
concentration for each compound that would not trigger
more than 35% of cell death, in order to be able to
observe a possible potentialization of both compounds
effect with the combined treatment. After 10 days of
treatment, cells were fixed and stained with crystal violet
to obtain images and quantification of cell proliferation.
The results shown in the figure 4B are representative of
three independent experiments conducted on two MPM
cell lines. Results obtained in the six experiments are
provided individually as supplementary data (Figure S3).
For both cell lines, PEITC and cisplatin increase cell death
compared to untreated cells. PEITC is more potent than

Studies carried out on other cancer types such as
non-small cell lung cancer, ovarian, testicular or cervical
cancer demonstrated the implication of DNA damage in
cisplatin and PEITC cytotoxic effects [25-26]. We herein
evaluated on MPM cells the combination cisplatin-PEITC
on DNA damage by looking at the phosphorylation on
serine 139 of histone H2A.X (P-H2A.X), a specific marker
for DNA damage [27] (Figure 3 and additional figure
S2). No DNA damage was triggered by PEITC alone,
according to P-H2A.X staining, in any cell line. While no
DNA damage was observed in MPM cells after cisplatin
treatment alone, combination of cisplatin with PEITC
strongly enhanced P-H2A.X signal. This result suggests
a potentialization of both compounds’ effect on DNA
damage, indeed triggering more lesions than compounds
used alone. Combination of cisplatin with PEITC would
thus potentiate their apoptotic effect through DNA
damage.

Cisplatin-PEITC combination enhances MPM
cytotoxicity and prevents the generation of
resistant cells
Cisplatin and PEITC cytotoxic effects after 72h of
treatment were assessed using Uptiblue viability assay.

cisplatin while the combination of both compounds leads
to a clear potentialization of PEITC and cisplatin effects.
This result suggests that the combination of cisplatin
with PEITC potentiates their cytotoxic effect on MPM
cells. Furthermore, the effect of PEITC and cisplatin on
MPM cells viability over time was assessed over nine
days in order to establish a kinetic of both compounds
used alone or in combination (Figure 4C). Viability
was measured after 3, 6 and 9 days of treatment and
showed that cisplatin-PEITC combination significantly
potentiated both compounds’ cytotoxic effects. After 3
days of combined treatment, there was about 34% viable
cells while compounds alone led to approximately 60%
of viable cells. At day 9, there were about 28% viable
cells with cisplatin alone and 47% with PEITC. However,

cisplatin-PEITC combination led to less than 5% viable
cells after 9 days of treatment, thus suggesting a strong
synergy when both compounds were combined. Indeed,
the combination not only led to a significant increase of
cell death but more importantly prevented the emergence
of chemoresistance, making of this strategy a good
candidate to treat reluctant cancer such as MPM.

Cisplatin and PEITC combination is well
tolerated by primary mesothelial cells
Aiming at evaluating the toxicity of cisplatinPEITC combination on healthy cells, PMC were treated
with cisplatin and PEITC alone or in combination for

treatment. Values represent the mean ± SEM of three independent measurements on three distinct MPM cell lines. * p<0.05.

Cisplatin-PEITC combination is toxic on MPM
cells in the presence of M2 macrophages while
remaining safe for primary mesothelial cells

72h. Microscopy pictures (Figure 5A) and viability assay
(Figure 5B) showed that PMC were not affected by either
compounds alone or combined. Moreover, a comparison
between MPM and PMC clearly illustrates the safety of
our strategy for healthy cells while inducing almost 100%
MPM cell death (Figure 5C). This experiment suggests
that the combination could be injected in pleural cavities
with no side effect on cells of healthy pleura.

The tumor microenvironment is much different
than the physiological one, and it is now well known
that a number of factors can play an important role in
the development of the tumor and in the efficiency of
the treatment. As an example, M2 macrophages are cells
present in the microenvironment of many cancer types,
including mesothelioma, and have been described as
enhancers of tumor cell proliferation [28]. Moreover,
macrophages are cells that constitutively produce ROS
[29], they could thus be envisioned as potentially harmful
if combined to a compound also generating ROS. We
thus evaluated the cytotoxic effect of cisplatin-PEITC
combination on MPM and PMC in the presence of
macrophages (Figure 7). A differentiation experiment
was carried out from monocytes in order to obtain M2
macrophages that were phenotyped by Flow Cytometry
prior to their seeding at several concentrations in 96 well
plates (Figure S4), in co-culture with MPM or PMC. The
following day, cells were treated with cisplatin 0.8mg/l in
combination with PEITC at 4µM or 6 µM for 72h. The
results show that the combination was toxic on MPM cells
no matter which concentration of PEITC considered, in

Additional MPM cell lines are also sensitive to
Cisplatin-PEITC combination
The absence of cisplatin-PEITC toxicity on PMC
led us to compare the sensitivity of six additional MPM
cell lines from our biocollection (Figure 6). Half of MPM
tested cell lines (Meso13, Meso34 and Meso56) displayed
a strong resistance phenotype to cisplatin or PEITC after
the second treatment repetition. Cytotoxic effect and cell
death were significantly enhanced by combining both
compounds, but their kinetics were variable according to
each cell line. Indeed, combination best efficiency was
observed at day 3 for Meso47, 56 and 76 and at day 6 for
Meso13, 34 and 96. However, for all cell lines, combining
both compounds significantly improved their cytotoxic
effects, compared to compounds alone, indeed leading to
less than 10% of viable cells after 9 days of treatment.

the presence or not of M2 macrophages. As previously
observed, the combination was safe on PMC for both
concentrations of PEITC. Even though the presence of
macrophages seemed to sensitize PMC to the combination
with the highest concentration of PEITC, the combination
of cisplatin with 4µM of PEITC remained safe whereas

allowed us to prove that the combination cisplatin-PEITC

metabolite [3-4]. Although this combination showed
greater results than drugs used alone, the benefit for
patients remains insufficient. The investigation of new
therapeutic strategies to approach this thoracic malignancy
thus became a necessity.
ITCs, arising from the hydrolysis of glucosinolates
contained in cruciferous vegetables, are well known for
their anti-carcinogenic properties [10]. Growth of several
kinds of cancer cells was shown to be inhibited by ITCs:
leukemia [30-31], prostate cancer [32], breast cancer [3334], colorectal cancer [35] etc. PEITC, a member of ITCs
family, was described as an important anti-carcinogenic
compound in humans [10,20]. Using MPM cell lines
established in our laboratory from patients’ pleural fluids,
we demonstrated for the first time that these cells were
sensitive to this compound. Furthermore, we showed that
PEITC-induced MPM cell death by apoptosis was fully
dependent on ROS production.

DISCUSSION
Treatment of MPM represents a major public health
challenge given its aggressiveness, poor prognosis after
diagnosis and more importantly its lack of effective
curative therapies. The first line treatment consists in
a combination of cisplatin with the Pemetrexed anti-

However, the benefit of MPM first line treatment is
insufficient and needs to be improved. A previous study
demonstrated an interesting potentialization of cisplatin
effect when combined to PEITC in a model of lung cancer
[36]. This study suggested that PEITC could be a good
candidate to improve the effect of cisplatin on MPM cells.
We first characterized the effect of cisplatin on
our MPM cell lines. We observed a dose dependent
toxicity of cisplatin through apoptosis induction partly
dependent on an oxidative stress, as demonstrated by
the use of NAC. We then demonstrated that PEITCinduced cytotoxic effects were entirely mediated through
oxidative stress generation in cells, while there was more
than this mechanism involved in cisplatin-induced cell
death mechanisms of action. Although a couple of studies
recently investigated the impact of cisplatin-PEITC
combination on other cancer types [37-38], our work
focuses for the first time on MPM, and brings new insights
for a better approach of this incurable disease. Healthy
and malignant mesothelioma models had previously
been investigated using similar strategies acting on the
induction of an oxidative stress alone or in combination
with cisplatin, confirming the relevance of these strategies
[39-40]. However, we here in showed for the first time that
cisplatin-PEITC combination significantly enhanced MPM
cell death, potentiated DNA damage and more importantly
is safe for healthy cells and prevents the emergence of
resistant cells.

Cisplatin-PEITC combination showed a decrease
of cell viability after 72h of treatment. Moreover, a
clonogenic assay carried out over 10 days on MPM cells
confirmed that the combination led to a potentialization of
both compounds’ cytotoxic effect. Although cisplatin and
PEITC showed interesting anti-tumor activity after 72h
when used alone, repeated treatments led to the apparition
of resistant cells characterized by a loss of compounds’
efficacy to increase cell cytotoxicity over time. Indeed,
we observed, in more than half of MPM tested cell lines,
a decrease of sensitivity or a resistance towards each
molecule. This could explain the poor therapeutic benefit
of cisplatin on MPM patients and could also suggest
that PEITC used alone would have limited efficacy for
its clinical use. The mechanisms of action of these two
molecules were already described and mainly result
in the formation of DNA damage [25-26]. Our results
confirmed the adaptive capacities of tumor cells to this
class of chemotherapeutic-induced lesions. However,
DNA damage induced by cisplatin or PEITC is of different
nature thus implying the involvement of distinct pathways
of the DNA damage response (DDR) for cells to bypass
those lesions. MPM patients sensitivity to cisplatin was
previously correlated to mRNA expression of the excision
repair cross-complementation group 1 (ERCC1) involved
in the nucleotide excision repair (NER) pathway [41].
ROS production in cells acts by different mechanisms to
damage DNA bases, but mainly affects guanine that gets

transformed into 8-oxo-2’deoxyguanosine (8-oxoG) [42].
The main DNA repair mechanism involved to remove
ROS-induced DNA lesions is the base excision repair
(BER) pathway [42]. Therefore, we hypothesized that
by combining cisplatin with PEITC, both BER and NER
pathways would be activated. The possibility to raise
resistant cells would thus be limited due to the difficulty
for a cell to set up two pathways of the DDR at the same
time. Our results demonstrated that all tested cell lines
were sensitive to cisplatin-PEITC combination, reaching
less than 5% of viable cells after three repetitions of
treatment. We thus showed a correlation between cisplatinPEITC cytotoxicity and DNA damage potentialization
triggered by the combination, as illustrated by the
recruitment of the phosphorylated histone H2A.X to the
DNA [27]. These last results therefore demonstrated that
the DDR machineries were overwhelmed, preventing the
generation of resistant cells.
Interestingly, cisplatin-PEITC combination induced
absolutely no toxicity on PMC while the same treatment
induced MPM cell death. By performing repetitive
treatments over nine days, we also demonstrated that
the combination prevented the emergence of resistant
tumor cells. Indeed, we confirmed that the combination
was efficient on nine MPM cell lines while more than
half of them became resistant to drugs used alone. These
results suggest that cisplatin-PEITC combination could
be an interesting strategy to treat MPM using a local
administration regarding its lack of toxicity on PMC. The
higher sensitivity of MPM cells to the combined treatment
compared to PMC probably results from the capacity
of PMC to support mild and severe oxidative stress,
thanks to gluthatione redox cycle and catalase-mediated
protection [43]. Usually, these anti-oxydant pathways are
altered in malignant cells and associated with an increased
metabolic activity. These changes lead to a higher level
of ROS in malignant cells compared to healthy cells,
which contribute to promote oncogenic properties such as
generation of resistant cells to conventional therapies but
also to sensitize cells to strong oxidative stress [42]. This
combination already demonstrated its efficacy on breast
cancer [37] and leukemia cells [44] while displaying no
toxicity on their healthy counterpart, suggesting a good
tolerability of healthy cells towards cisplatin-PEITC
combination.
The tumoral microenvironment plays an important
role in the development of the tumor and several actors are
involved [45]. Among all cells present in the environment
of the tumor, macrophages are of significant importance
and have been described as enhancers of tumor cell
proliferation [28]. Moreover, macrophages are cells that
constitutively produce ROS [29], which could be of harm
if added to a compound also generating ROS. We thus
investigated the effect of cisplatin-PEITC combination
on MPM and PMC in co-culture with macrophages.
We showed that cisplatin-PEITC was toxic on MPM
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

cells for both concentrations of PEITC. The presence of
macrophages did not modify the sensitivity of MPM cells
to the combination. Moreover, although the strongest
concentration of PEITC (6µM) combined to cisplatin
led to a higher sensitivity of PMC to the combination,
we showed that cisplatin combined to PEITC at 4µM
was toxic on MPM cells while remaining safe for PMC.
The highest sensitivity of PMC to cisplatin combined to
the highest concentration of PEITC thus confirms the
importance of the microenvironment in the toxicity of
the treatments. However, for a dose of cisplatin-PEITC
highly toxic on MPM cells, we demonstrated here that this
combination remains safe on PMC.
Therefore, a local administration of cisplatinPEITC combination in pleural cavity could be a promising
strategy to induce selective toxicity towards malignant
cells. Altogether, cisplatin-PEITC combination would
enhance cancer cell death compared to compounds used
alone and prevent the emergence of cell resistance, while
remaining safe for PMC.

CONCLUSION
The combination of cisplatin with the natural
compound PEITC induces a strong MPM cell death, while
remaining safe for PMC, with limited emergence of cell
resistance compared to drugs used alone. Therefore, this
combination could represent a promising strategy for the
treatment of MPM.

Determination of cell viability
Cell viability was monitored using Uptiblue reagent
(Interchim) as previously described [22]. Cells were
seeded in 96-well plates at a density of 5x103cells/well for
MPM cells in culture medium for 24h. Then compounds
were added for an additional 72h and Uptiblue reagent
(5%, v/v) was then added to the culture medium for 2h
at 37°C. Fluorescence was measured at 605nm after a
green epi illumination excitation using a ChemiDoc™ MP
imaging system (Biorad). Quantification was performed
using ImageJ 1.41o software. For kinetic experiments,
culture medium containing Uptiblue was replaced by
medium with or without drug for 72h and the procedure
for cell viability measurement was repeated twice. Results
were expressed as percentage of untreated cells.

Co-culture assay
MPM and PMC were co-cultured with M2
macrophages and treated with cisplatin and PEITC
alone or in combination for 72h. Three MPM cell lines
were used: Meso4, 11 and 152, seeded in a 96 well plate
at a density of 5.103 cells/well. According to cell rate
proliferation, primary mesothelial cells were seeded at a
density of 2.104 cells/well in order to create a cell layer
similar to the physiological conditions. M2 macrophages
were obtained from monocytes that were differentiated
with a treatment with M-CSF (50ng/ml). As a control,
a fraction of monocytes was also treated with GM-CSF
(20ng/ml) to obtain M1 macrophages. After 5 days, both
M-CSF and GM-CSF-treated monocytes were harvested
and characterized by flow cytometry using CD14-FITC
and CD163-APC staining. M2 macrophages were seeded
in co-culture with MPM or PMC at two concentrations:
100 and 10 macrophages per well. 24h after seeding, cells
were treated with cisplatin at 0.8mg/l in combination with
PEITC at 4µM or 6µM for 72h. Cell viability was then
measured using Uptiblue counting reagent as described
above. Fluorescence was measured at 605nm after a green
epi illumination excitation using a ChemiDoc™ MP
imaging system (Biorad). Quantification was performed
using ImageJ 1.41o software.

Detection of Reactive oxygen species
Cells were seeded at a density of 1x106cells/well in
12 well plates. 24h after seeding, cells were washed once
with PBS and incubated for 30min at 37°C with the CMH2DCFA probe (Life Technologies), resuspended in PBS
at a final concentration of 5µM, washed once with PBS and
treated with Cisplatin or PEITC alone or in combination.
24h after treatment, cells and their supernatant were
harvested and analyzed by flow cytometry (FACSCalibur;
Becton Dickinson). Ten thousand events were collected
and analyzed with the FACS Flowjo Software (Tree Star
Inc).

Detection of apoptosis
Cells were seeded at a density of 1x106cells/well in
6-well plates and treated with indicated concentrations.
After 24h, floating and adherent cells were combined,
labeled using Annexin V-allophycocyanin (APC) (Becton
Dickinson) following the manufacturer’s instructions,
and analyzed by flow cytometry (FACSCalibur; Becton
Dickinson). Ten thousand events were collected and
analyzed with the FACS Flowjo Software (Tree Star Inc).

Microscopic experiments
Cells were seeded in culture medium on glass
coverslips at a density of 5x104cells/well in 12 well plates.
24h later, drugs alone or in combination were added for
additional 24h. Cells were washed twice with PBS and
fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS, 15min at room
temperature. Cells were permeabilized with 0.05% Triton
X-100 (Merck) /0.05% Tween-20 (Sigma-Aldrich) in
PBS (5min) and incubated with anti-γH2A.X (phospho
S139) antibody at 1µg/ml (Abcam) in PBS/1% BSA for
1h. Cells were washed twice with PBS and incubated
with a DyLighttm 633 conjugated secondary antibody
(Thermo Scientific) for 1h. After an additional PBS wash,

Clonogenic assay
Two MPM cell lines were used to assess their effect
on MPM cells proliferation: Meso4 and Meso152. This
assay requires cells that grow in colonies, which was not
the case of the third cell line used over this study for the

cell nuclei were stained with 1µg/ml Hoechst (SigmaAldrich) (5min). Coverslips were mounted in ProLong®
Gold (Molecular Probes) and fluorescence was visualized
using the Axiovert200M microscopy system (Zeiss, Le
Pecq, France) with ApoTome module (X63 and numerial
aperture 1.4).
