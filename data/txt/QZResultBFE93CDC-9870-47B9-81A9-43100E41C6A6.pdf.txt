Acquired drug resistance constitutes a major challenge for effective cancer therapies with
melanoma being no exception. The dynamics leading to permanent resistance are poorly
understood but are important to design better treatments. Here we show that drug exposure,
hypoxia or nutrient starvation leads to an early innate cell response in melanoma cells resulting in
multidrug resistance, termed induced drug-tolerant cells (IDTCs). Transition into the IDTC state
seems to be an inherent stress reaction for survival toward unfavorable environmental conditions
or drug exposure. The response comprises chromatin remodeling, activation of signaling cascades
and markers implicated in cancer stemness with higher angiogenic potential and tumorigenicity.
These changes are characterized by a common increase in CD271 expression concomitantly with
loss of differentiation markers such as melan-A and tyrosinase, enhanced aldehyde dehydrogenase
(ALDH) activity and upregulation of histone demethylases. Accordingly, IDTCs show a loss of
H3K4me3, H3K27me3 and gain of H3K9me3 suggesting activation and repression of differential
genes. Drug holidays at the IDTC state allow for reversion into parental cells re-sensitizing them
to the drug they were primarily exposed to. However, upon continuous drug exposure IDTCs
eventually transform into permanent and irreversible drug-resistant cells. Knockdown of CD271
or KDM5B decreases transition into the IDTC state substantially but does not prevent it. Targeting

IDTCs would be crucial for sustainable disease management and prevention of acquired drug
resistance.

INTRODUCTION
Over decades of research and development, acquired drug resistance has always been a
major challenge for cancer treatment. The advent of molecular targeted therapies provides
improved and less toxic options, whereupon generic drugs were replaced by more specific
therapeutic inhibitors. This approach showed promising results in multiple cancers including
BRAF-mutated melanomas.1 Acquired drug resistance, however, remains a major obstacle2
in the path of sustainable disease management or long-term survival.

Author Manuscript

Opposed to earlier models of permanent drug resistance, recent studies have suggested that
phenotypic plasticity is a key factor to the emergence of a transient drug-resistant state,
which is reversible in nature by timely drug holidays3,4 exemplified in the case of BRAF
inhibitors. It is unknown whether phenotypic plasticity is due to selection of a subpopulation
of cells as described by various reports4–6 or whether it could be a generic stress-induced
response of melanoma cells to a stressful environment.

Author Manuscript

In this study we tested whether melanoma cells are capable of exhibiting a generic stress
response that could explain the phenotypic plasticity contributing to drug resistance. While
approaching this question we observed that melanoma cells are capable of exhibiting an
early innate response to stressful environments. This innate response not only allows cells to
exert multidrug tolerance, but in addition provides them with highly tumorigenic properties.
On continuous drug exposure IDTCs experience transition into permanent drug resistance
reversing into a parental cell-like state.

RESULTS
Exposure of melanoma cells to sublethal drug concentrations leads to multidrug tolerance

Author Manuscript

An increasing amount of literature in cancer biology suggests that drug-resistant
subpopulations exist in parental cells and are selected during treatment. If this paradigm
holds true, a small group of cells should consistently survive the exposure to different drugs.
To test this hypothesis, we exposed 1 × 106 mutant BRAF WM164 metastatic melanoma
cells to various concentrations of the BRAF inhibitor PLX4032 (250 nM, 500 nM, 1 and 10
μM) for a period of 12 days. The surviving number of cells calculated in relation to the
absolute number of cells seeded at the beginning ranged from 4.51% (±0.35) at 10 μM to
99.5% (±1.48) and 156.5% (±13.43) at 500 and 250 nM, respectively, indicating that at 250
and 500 nM of PLX4032 no significant selection pressure was exerted on the parental
population (Figures 1a and b). On the basis of the small number of cells surviving 10 μM
PLX4032 we argued that if only a small number of cells were resistant to PLX4032, then the
majority of cells surviving lower concentrations of PLX4032 should be eliminated if
exposed to higher concentrations of the drug. Therefore, WM164 cells exposed to 250 or
500 nM of PLX4032 for 12 days were exposed to 10 μM PLX4032 for additional 12 days.
Contrary to what might be expected, cells exposed to low concentrations of PLX4032

became tolerant toward the higher concentration of the drug. The entire cell population
survived the exposure to 10 μM and no significant increase in cell death was observed
(Figures 1a and b). This suggests that low and moderate drug concentrations initiate an early
adaptive response in the surviving cell population, which subsequently confers tolerance to
higher drug concentrations. Real-time cell cycle imaging using WM164-FUCCI cells (Haass
et al.)7 suggested an almost complete G1 arrest at concentrations from 500 nM on after 12 h
of drug exposure pointing to an immediate growth inhibition that continued for 12 days
indicating that no particular outgrowth of any subpopulation occurred (Supplementary
Figure S1). Melanoma cells undergoing this early adaptive response were termed ‘induced
drug-tolerant cells’ (IDTCs).

Author Manuscript

We then determined whether the exhibited drug tolerance of IDTCs was specific for
PLX4032 or applicable to other drugs as well. IDTCs generated within 12 days from 250
and 500 nM PLX4032 WM164 cells were further exposed to the MEK inhibitor
GSK1120212 (50 nM) or cisplatin (30 μM) for 2 days. The IDTCs showed an even
significantly lower sensitivity to the second drug, suggesting that a multidrug tolerant state
is achieved within the first 12 days (Figure 1c). This experiment was repeated with the
BRAF-mutated A375 malignant melanoma cell line at 100 and 250 nM PLX4032, for which
similar results were obtained (Figures 1d and e). Interestingly, a 7-day drug holiday was
sufficient to re-sensitize the cells to both PLX4032 and GSK1120212 (Figure 1f). This
suggests a drug-induced transition and reversible resistance rather than selection of a
preexisting population. Cells surviving high concentrations of PLX4032 also showed similar
characteristics (data not shown).
Characterization of IDTCs

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

To understand the drug tolerance to PLX4032 exhibited by IDTCs, western blot analyses of
the key melanoma survival pathways MAPK-ERK and AKT were carried out. WM164
IDTCs showed highly active ERK, MEK and AKT signaling (Figure 2a). Time point
analyses monitoring the transition of WM164 to IDTCs following exposure to 500 nM
PLX4032 revealed that both phosphorylated AKT and MEK-ERK activation occurred on
day 8 after exposure, which further peaked on day 12 (Supplementary Figure S2A). IDTCs
were subjected to whole-genome-wide gene expression analysis and expression profiles
were compared with the parental population. Substantial differences in global gene
expression between WM164 parental and IDTCs were observed (Supplementary Figure
S2B). For example, a significant increase in expression of various melanocyte progenitor
and proposed melanoma stem cell markers such as CD271 and SOX108 along with CD44,
SOX2, and the EMT inducer SOX49 was observed in IDTCs. They also showed increased
expression of various drug efflux genes such as ABCB5,10 ABCA5,11 ABCB812 and
ABCB413 (Supplementary Figure S2C, Supplementary Table 1A). WM164 IDTCs generated
et al also showed a loss of differentiation markers such as melan-A14 and tyrosinase15
(Figure 2b) suggesting that exposure to stress is inducing an undifferentiated state.
High expression of CD271 was confirmed by flow cytometry in 500 nM PLX4032-generated
IDTCs compared with parental cells (Figure 2c). Expression levels of CD271 correlated
with drug concentration and time of exposure (Supplementary Figure S2D). Drug-induced

CD271 expression was verified in multiple melanoma cell lines exposed to different drugs
including chemotherapy like cisplatin strongly supporting the idea of a generic phenomenon
(Supplementary Figures S2E and H). In addition, we observed that CD271+ve IDTCs
originate from different subpopulations of parental cells under drug exposure and
subsequent drug holidays lead to loss of CD271 expression (Supplementary Figures S3A
and E). WM164 IDTCs also exhibited an increase in ALDH activity, which is another
proposed marker for cancer stemness16,17 (Figure 2d). The increase in ALDH activity was
confirmed in A375 IDTCs (Supplementary Figure S2I). We then determined whether the
IDTC state also encompasses an altered chromatin state. Microarray analyses revealed the
upregulation of genes linked to epigenetic remodeling, particularly the H3K27 (KDM6A,
KDM6B) and H3K4 (KDM1B, KDM5A, KDM5B) demethylases (Supplementary Table 1B,
Supplementary Figure S2J). Both loss of H3K4me3 and an increase in H3K4 demethylases
have been previously reported to induce multidrug tolerance in cancer. In melanoma, the
H3K4-demethylating enzyme KDM5B in particular has been demonstrated to be a key
marker for a slow cycling subpopulation contributing to drug tolerance.5,6 In order to assess
the activity of this marker, a KDM5B promoter construct tagged to Ds red was employed in
WM164 melanoma cells. WM164 IDTCs carrying the Ds red construct showed a high level
of activity compared with the parental cells (Supplementary Figure S2K). Accordingly,
analyses of H3K4 and H3K27 methylation revealed a downregulation of H3K4me3 and
H3K27me3 in IDTCs, whereas there was an increase in H3K9me3 (Figure 2e). The global
chromatin modification with loss of H3K4me3 and a gain of H3K9me3 has been associated
with transcriptional silencing18,19 and pathway analysis of microarray data confirmed a
downregulation of transcription and replication pathways (Supplementary Figure S4A,B) in
the IDTC population, suggesting a slow cycling semiquiescent state. Altogether, our results
point to a state of chromatin remodeling guiding cells to an undifferentiated state as a
characteristic of the IDTC transition.
To test whether the increase in CD271 might also be observed in vivo, xenograft tumors in
SCID mice previously induced by subcutaneous injection of BRAF-mutant 451Lu
melanoma cells were treated with a low dose (30 mg/kg) of PLX4720 (BRAF inhibitor). The
dosage did not substantially influence tumor growth (Figure 2f). Tumors harvested
following 2 weeks of low-dose treatment showed an increase in CD271 expression,
suggesting a transition to the IDTC state similar to what was observed et al (Figure 2f).
Further investigations in two matched patient samples pre- and post therapy with either
vemurafenib or chemotherapy showed increased numbers of CD271+ve cells after
treatment, with the majority of CD271+ve cells being located in close proximity to tumor
blood vessels (Figure 2g).

IDTCs show high angiogenic and tumorigenic properties
To test for functional characteristics of WM164, IDTCs parental cells and IDTCs were
plated at 50, 500 and 5000 cells/well in ultralow attachment plates without drug exposure for
a period of 7 days, to probe for their capability to form spheroids. IDTCs but not parental
cells grew as melanoma spheroids at a significantly higher rate, even when plated at 50 cells
per well, for which parental cells failed to initiate spheroid formation (Figure 3a). On the
basis of these observations we tested the tumorigenic potential of IDTCs in vivo using a

xenograft NOD.CB17-Prkdcscid/J mouse model by injecting 50, 500 and 5000 cells per site
of either WM164 IDTCS or parental cells. Palpable tumors at IDTC-injected sites were
observed within 20 days for both 500 and 5000 cells, whereas tumor development was
delayed by more than a week at the sites where parental cells were injected (Figure 3b).
Tumor volumes from parental cells were also found to be significantly lower than for IDTCgenerated tumors especially when injected at a low cell number. These results suggest that
IDTCs have an enhanced tumorigenic potential under drug-free conditions. The high
tumorigenic property of IDTCs prompted us to investigate the angiogenic signature.
Conditioned medium from parental cells and IDTCs was probed for multiple angiogenic
factors using an angiogenesis array. IDTCs secreted high levels of angiogenin,
angiopoietin1, angiopoietin2, artemin, epidermal growth factor (EGF), endocrine gland
derived vascular endothelial growth factor (EG-VEGF), hepatocyte growth factor (HGF)
and insulin-like growth factor binding protein 2 (IGFBP2) (Figure 3c). These et al results
were corroborated by staining tumor tissue from our xenografts with CD31, to detect vessel
formation. IDTC tumors showed increased vessel formation compared with parental tumors
(Figure 3d) indicating that the expression of angiogenic factors by IDTCs leads to increased
vascularization. Together, the studies indicate that the transition of parental cells to IDTCs is
accompanied by an increased angiogenic potential further supporting the occurrence of
increased tumorigenicity.
Exposure to stress-inducing environments such as hypoxia or nutrient starvation
generates an IDTC-like phenotype

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

The formation of IDTCs based on exposure to different drugs made us ponder whether
environmental factors usually present in the tumor microenvironment, such as hypoxia or
nutrient starvation, might also instigate their formation. WM164 cells were exposed to
moderate (5% O2) or pronounced hypoxic (1% O2) conditions for a period of 12 days. At
1% O2 significant cell death was observed (survival percentage 36.5 (±3.74) %),
corresponding to high concentrations of PLX4032, but no reduction in the number of viable
cells was found at 5% O2 (122.5 (±9.1) %; Figure 4a). Equivalent to drug exposure,
moderate hypoxic conditions evoked tolerance toward exposure to 1% O2 mimicking an
IDTC state. The experiments were repeated under glucose-starving conditions, whereupon
WM164 cells were subjected to low glucose at 1 mg/ml or no glucose media for a period of
12 days. In the absence of glucose the entire parental population died within 12 days,
whereas at 1 mg/ml most of the cells survived (95.15 (±1.9) %). In addition, cells surviving
the low-glucose condition were found to be tolerant if immediately switched to no glucose
media over 12 days (Figure 4b). The cells surviving moderate hypoxia and low glucose were
probed for characteristics observed in drug-induced IDTCs. An increase in CD271
expression and ALDH activity was observed in WM164 cells exposed to both conditions
(Figures 4c and d). A375 cells exposed to 5% O2 also showed an increase in CD271 and
ALDH activity (Supplementary Figure S5A). Reverse transcription–PCR analysis of
WM164 hypoxia and low-glucose-exposed cells revealed an increase in ABCB5, the stem
cell marker OCT4 and KDM5A expression under both conditions (Supplementary Figure
S5B). The expression of other markers seems to be context-dependent, as an increase of
KDM5B was only observed under hypoxic conditions and SOX10 only in cells exposed to
low glucose (Supplementary Figure S5C). Invariably, both 5% O2 and lowglucose-exposed

cells displayed increased ERK and AKT phosphorylation (Figure 4e), along with a loss of
H3K4me3 and H3K27me3 as well as a gain of H3K9me3 (Figure 4f). The increase in ERK
phosphorylation in IDTCs resulting from exposure to a BRAF inhibitor was thought to be a
drug-related response bypassing BRAF signaling, as previously reported.20 Rather, this
signaling pattern appears to be the same in cells arising from exposure to hypoxic and lowglucose conditions, suggesting a generic response contributing to ERK activation.

Author Manuscript

As the expression of specific markers found in drug-induced IDTCs was analogous to cells
evolving under hypoxic or lowglucose conditions, we further probed whether these cells
exhibit multidrug tolerance by exposing them to PLX4032 (10 μM), GSK1120212 (50 nM) or
cisplatin (10 μM; Figure 4g). Low caspase 3 activities were found for cells pre-exposed to
hypoxic or lowglucose conditions compared with parental cells, indicating the acquisition of
a phenotype conferring tolerance toward multiple drugs. Similar results were obtained in
A375 cells exposed to 5% O2 (Supplementary Figure S5D). These data suggest that an
IDTC-like state can be urged by common microenvironmental factors such as hypoxia or
low nutrient availability, which points to a general early innate response to persistent
hazardous conditions.
CD271 or KDM5B knockdown limits the efficiency of transition into an IDTC state

Author Manuscript

Previous reports on targeting tolerant subpopulations have suggested combination strategies
involving inhibitors of IGF-1R, the AKT pathway or the HDAC inhibitor TSA, eradicating a
preexisting slow cycling multidrug-tolerant population.4 We tested these strategies on
PLX4032-induced WM164 IDTCs, as well as on IDTCs from 5% hypoxia and low glucose
by exposing these cells to a combination of PLX4032 with OSI906 (IGF-1R inhibitor),
Ly294002 (Pi3K/AKT inhibitor) or TSA. Regardless of the treatment combination, IDTCs
consistently showed a high tolerance toward treatment when compared with parental cells
(Figure 5a). Accordingly, exposure of already established IDTCs over 12 days to the same
drug combinations did not result in a notable effect on survival; rather, the combination
seemed to induce a minor reduction in growth rate (Supplementary Figure S6A).

Author Manuscript

These results prompted us to look for alternative approaches to target IDTCs. The increased
CD271 expression as a characteristic marker of IDTCs suggested a potential new target that
could resensitize cells, similar to what has been reported for KDM5B in eliminating a slow
cycling melanoma population.6 Indeed, stable knockdown of either CD271 (WM164 sh
CD271) or KDM5B (WM164 sh KDM5B) in the parental cells increased their sensitivity to
single or combination strategies compared with control short hairpin RNA (shRNA)transduced WM164 cells exposed to single or combined treatments (Figure 5b). More
durable effects were observed in the case of prolonged exposure over 12 days to different
concentrations of PLX4032, whereupon the number of surviving cells was substantially
reduced in WM164 shCD271 and WM164 shKDM5B cells, even at 250 and 500 nM (Figure
5c). Despite the considerable cell death observed in CD271 and KDM5B knockdown cells
upon exposure to single or combined drug strategies, the reminiscent population,
unexpectedly, invariably displayed drug tolerance similar to that of IDTCs rising from the
control shRNA transduced parental cell population (Figure 5d). This was also true for a
combination of PLX4032 with oligomycin A, which affects the mitochondrial survival

pathways and has been reported to eradicate slow cycling cells.6 The expression of CD271
and KDM5B was analyzed in the surviving WM164 shCD271 and WM164 shKDM5B
IDTCs to ensure that the results observed were not due to inefficient knockdown of protein
or loss of shRNA expression (Supplementary Figures S6B and C). The silencing of KDM5B
could favor the occurrence of a presumed subpopulation of tolerant cells lacking KDM5B
expression. To test this WM164 shKDM5B-transduced cells were labeled with a Ds red
KDM5B promoter. The WM164 shKDM5B IDTCs also showed higher KDM5B promoter
activity (Figure 5e), suggesting that no distinct subpopulation of cells that naturally lack
KDM5B expression was selected during the process.

Author Manuscript

Altogether the results suggest that several combined treatment strategies that have been
reported so far to eliminate multidrug-tolerant cells cannot fully eradicate the IDTC
population, rather they are more effective in increasing cell death in the parental population
before transition into IDTCs.
IDTCs activate multiple signaling pathways allowing rewiring of signaling and tolerance to
targeted inhibitors

Author Manuscript

Our observation that IDTCs remain insensitive to multiple drugs, even after targeting the
pathways they depend upon, is intriguing. Hence, the impact of drugs in cell signaling was
monitored by exposing PLX4032-generated IDTCs to a combination of PLX4032 and
GSK1120212, as they showed a high level of MEK phosphorylation. As expected, exposure
to GSK1120212 completely inhibited MEK phosphorylation on days 3, 6 and 12 (Figure
6a). However, it was interesting to note that ERK phosphorylation was only partially
inhibited by GSK1120212 indicating that ERK phosphorylation is not exclusively wired
through MEK phosphorylation in IDTCs. Moreover, GSK1120212-induced downregulation
of ERK phosphorylation only lasted for few days since ERK phosphorylation was reestablished in IDTCs on day 12 (Figure 6a).

Author Manuscript

The phenomenon of rewiring in IDTCs subsequently resulting in drug tolerance was tested
for PI3K/AKT and HDAC inhibitors as well. To this purpose, IDTCs were exposed to a
combination of PLX4032 along with either the PI3K inhibitor Ly294002 or the HDAC
inhibitor TSA for a period of 12 days and cells were harvested for analyses on days 3, 6 and
12. When Ly294002 was used in combination with PLX4032, a downregulation of AKT
signaling on days 3 and 8 was achieved, but on day 12, a reactivation of signaling was
observed (Figure 6b). HDAC inhibitors have been reported to increase H3K4me3 expression
levels that has been linked to transcriptional activation of promoters18 and to decrease
H3K9me321 a transcriptional repressor.19 Therefore, expression levels of these two markers
after exposure of IDTCs to TSA (100 nM) were determined. On day 3, an increase in
H3K4me3 and loss of H3K9me3 was observed, whereas on continuous exposure for 12
days, expression levels of H3K4me3 and H3K9me3 reversed to IDTC levels before
exposure to TSA (Figure 6c). These results suggest that IDTCs have a unique capability to
rewire through multiple signaling cascades in order to regain their innate IDTC state.
To test for activation of multiple signaling pathways, WM164 parental and IDTC cell
lysates were subjected to reverse phase protein array (RPPA) analyses. Compared with the
parental cells, a significant increase in activation of ATM (pS1981),22 EGFR (pY1068),23

FGFR (pY653),24,25 YAP (pS127),26 FAK (pY397)27 and SRC (pY416)28 was found in
IDTCs, all of which have been reported to be potential activators of both ERK and AKT
signaling (Figure 6d, Supplementary Table S2). IDTCs also showed an increase in PKCA
expression and pS657 phosphorylation, which has been shown to induce AKT and ERK
activation29 and activation of the mTOR pathway, a common downstream target of AKT,
ERK and PKCA signaling. Correspondingly, RPPA analyses also showed an increase in
RAPTOR and mTOR expression along with an increase in mTOR pS2448 phosphorylation
(Figure 6e). Further, as suggested by immunoblotting RPPA analysis also confirmed the
upregulation of AKT and ERK phosphorylation along with upregulation of the antiapoptotic protein BCL-2 (Figure 6f). These results underscore the extent of signaling
pathways involved in rendering IDTCs drug tolerant.

IDTCs undergo transition into a permanent drug resistant state under prolonged drug
treatment

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

Reversible drug-induced plasticity has been recently reported followed by the emergence of
permanent drug resistance.3 Hence, we hypothesized that persistent drug exposure would
lead to a loss of the transient IDTC state leading to a shift toward a permanent resistant state.
WM164 IDTCs were maintained in 500 nM PLX4032 over 90 days and their CD271
expression was monitored on days 12, 23, 58 and 90. Interestingly, the CD271 expression
gradually increased from days 12 to 23 but then declined on day 58. After 90 days of
continuous drug exposure, the cells completely lost their CD271 expression suggestive of an
altered phenotype (Figure 7a). There was also a concomitant decrease in ERK and AKT
phosphorylation and JARID1B expression (Figure 7b) along with an increase in cell
proliferation (Supplementary Figure S7A). These cells were termed WM164 PLX-R
(Resistant). To test whether WM164 PLX-R also account for a nonreversible drug-resistant
phenotype and to determine their multidrug-tolerant properties, WM164 PLX-R, IDTCs
reversed to the parental state by drug holidays (58 days PLX4032 exposure followed by 45
days drug holiday; 58d IDTC-Rev), and IDTCs were probed for multidrug tolerance by
exposing them to PLX4032 (10 μM), GSK1120212 (50 nM), Cisplatin (30 μM), Adrucil (25
μg/ml) and Docetaxel (20 nM). Both the 58d IDTC-Rev and the WM164 PLX-R cells were
found to be sensitive to different drugs, suggesting a loss of multidrug tolerance as opposed
to IDTCs (Figure 7c). The only difference between WM164 PLX-R and 58d IDTC-Rev
cells was their regained sensitivity toward high concentrations of PLX4032 (10 μM). WM164
PLX-R cells displayed no significant increase in caspase 3 activity in contrast to 58d IDTCRev cells suggesting that WM164 PLX-R cells exert an acquired drug resistance state
toward PLX4032. In addition, a reduced tumorigenic potential for WMM164 PLX-R was
also observed in xenografts if compared with WM164 IDTCs, although the cells showed a
slightly increased tumor growth than parental cells (data not shown; Figure 7d).
Our results suggest that a profound decrease in CD271 expression under persistent drug
exposure characterizes a state of permanent resistance to the specific drug. The reason for
this transformation is currently unknown, as a mutational analysis of 409 oncogenes (Ion
AmpliSeq Comprehensive Cancer Panel) on parental, IDTCs generated after 58 days and
WM164 PLX-R cells did not yield any evidence for de novo mutations to trigger a new
phenotype (data not shown). However, rewiring of signaling pathways as a mutation-

independent mechanism leading to permanent resistance has been previously described.30
Further, we tested whether the WM164 PLX-R cells retained the capacity to exhibit the
primary response by exposing the resistant cell populations to a new drug in order to reinduce an IDTC state. WM164 PLX-R cells were exposed to the MEK inhibitor
GSK1120212, which caused the re-induction of CD271 (Supplementary Figure S7B),
indicative of an IDTC-like phenotype.

DISCUSSION

Author Manuscript

This study shows that melanoma cells have an innate ability to survive persistent hostile
conditions such as drug exposure, hypoxia or nutrient starvation, by exhibiting an early
innate response. The primary innate response also induces a multidrug-tolerant state as a
primary step preceding acquired drug resistance. The transition from parental cells into
IDTCs would provide a buffer period allowing them to accumulate mutations and epigenetic
changes for a later permanent gain of drug resistance.

Author Manuscript

The stress response induces a global chromatin remodeling shifting the cells into a slow
cycling state. Loss of H3K4me3 has been reported in a subpopulation of pre-existing cells in
the parental population contributing to drug resistance;4 however, their mode of origin so far
is unknown. Our study indicates that the formation of this population could be a direct
stress-related response. CD271 expression and the loss of melanoma antigens, another
characteristic feature of the IDTC population, leads to resistance in patients subjected to
adoptive T-cell transfer therapy suggesting a broader generic mechanism behind this
process.31 Upregulation of CD271 has also been reported to be inducible by interferon γ in
melanoma cells.32 However, forced overexpression of CD271 alone was not sufficient to
induce the transition of parental cells while the molecule being still important for the
formation of IDTCs as observed in this study. This suggests that IDTC formation could be a
product of interrelation between multiple individual components including CD271
upregulation, histone modification and increased activity of multiple signaling pathways.

Author Manuscript

Accordingly, we observed that the combined strategies including the use of HDAC, IGF1R,
Pi3K/AKT inhibitors4 and oligomycin A targeting mitochondrial survival pathways,6 along
with the primary drug, exert a higher potential to eliminate the parental population before
transition into IDTCs, whereas IDTCs by themselves showed an elevated tolerance even
toward these combined exposures. The study suggests that multiple factors contribute to the
transition and maintenance of the IDTC state and from these observations it is tempting to
speculate that the burden of signaling is distributed between multiple pathways unlike the
parental BRAF mutant cells, which seem to be primarily dependent on BRAF-driven ERK
signaling. Further, persistent drug exposure seems to trigger a transition from IDTCs to a
permanently resistant fast-growing cell population, which shows characteristics similar to
parental cells, however, being resistant to the drug they were primarily exposed to.
Transposing this concept to the in vivo situation would mean that IDTC-like cells are almost
certainly present in the tumor because of adverse conditions imposed by the tumor
microenvironment and improper drug kinetics. Hence, continuous administration of drugs
would inevitably lead to the emergence of multidrug-tolerant IDTCs that upon prolonged

exposure might lead to permanent drug resistance. Employing an intermittent dosing is a
timely concept, which has already been shown to delay the emergence of resistance to
BRAF inhibitors.33 This concept needs further investigation along with combination
therapies, for example, targeting CD271, KDM5B or HDAC, which might result in a
continuous switching between parental and the IDTC state, with each transition gradually
reducing the tumor burden thereby leading to chronicity.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Generation of IDTCs

Author Manuscript

IDTCs were generated by exposing cancer cells to PLX4032, cisplatin, low glucose or
hypoxic conditions for a minimum of 12 days. RPMI media supplemented with 2 mM LGlutamine, 2 × Penstrep and 5% fetal calf serum were used to maintain the cells. Lowglucose media was made by mixing RPMI normal media in a 1:4 ratio with RPMI media
without glucose. Hypoxic experiments were performed in a hypoxic work station facility
from Biospherix (Model Nr.: G300CL, BioSpherix, Lacona, NY, USA) at the Ludwig
Boltzmann Institute for Lung Vascular Research, Medical University of Graz, Austria. The
media were replenished every third day for the period of the experiments.
Gene expression analyses
Gene expression analyses were carried out as previously reported34 by the Core Facility for
Molecular Biology at the Centre of Medical Research at the Medical University of Graz,
Graz, Austria. For details please see supplemental methods.
RPPA analysis

Author Manuscript

Cell lysates were probed with antibodies by a catalyzed signal amplification (CSA)
amplification approach and visualized by DAB colorimetric reaction. Slides were scanned
and the density was quantified by an Array-Pro Analyzer (TECAN, Maennedorf,
Switzerland). For details please see supplementary methods.

total ERK as loading control. (c) WM164 58d IDTC-Rev, WM164-resistant (Resistant) and
WM164 IDTCs (40-day old; IDTC) exposed to PLX4032 at 10 μM (PLX10), GSK1120212
(50 nM), cisplatin (30 μM), Adrucil (25 μg/ml) and docetaxel (20 nM) for 48 h and the
percentage of caspase 3-positive cells was analyzed by flow cytometry. Error bars represent
the s.d. from the mean. (d) Tumor volume after subcutaneous injection into NOD.CB17Prkdcscid/J mice at 50 (n = 3), 500(n = 4) or 5000(n = 4) cells of WM164-resistant or 500
nM IDTC cells. The tumor volume was measured at indicated time points.
