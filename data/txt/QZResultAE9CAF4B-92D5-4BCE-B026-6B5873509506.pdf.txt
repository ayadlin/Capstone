ABSTRACT
Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors (ICIs) are improving the survival of cancer
patients, however only the 20-30% of treated patients present clinical benefits.
Toxicity represents the major cause of reduced dosage, delayed drug administration
and therapy discontinuation. Hence in the context of multiple treatment possibilities,
the identification of predictive markers of response and toxicity is a challenging
approach for drug selection in order to obtain the best clinical benefit while
minimizing the side effects. The loss of the protective function of intestinal barriers
that interacts with the environment measured as increased intestinal permeability
and the changes occurring in the microbiota composition have been proposed as a
mechanism potentially explaining the pathogenesis of immune related toxicity.
In this review we discuss the new perspectives on the involvement of PD-1 and
PDL-1 in the cross talk between gut microbiota and immune fitness and how gut
microbiota impacts on the efficacy of anti-PD-1 and anti-PDL-1 treatments in cancer.

INTRODUCTION

“exhaustion”. Recent findings have defined the function of
some receptors that negatively regulate T cell activity and
promote exhaustion[2].
The intuition that targeting these receptors could
dramatically influence T cell activity was originally
of James P. Allison in his pioneer studies on cytotoxic
T-lymphocyte antigen 4 (CTLA-4) inhibitory receptors.
The idea was that if the negative regulation of T cells
could be blocked, T cell responses would be expanded
and sustained long enough to eliminate cancer [3][4].
The other important insight was translating the target
from the cancer cell and its antigenic/genomic repertoire
to the immune system unregarding the type of tumor and
the antigens expressed. Several antibodies to different
immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) where then generated
and tested in preclinical setting. They demonstrate
capacity to unleash existing T cells in a unspecific mode,
thus breaking the tolerance against self and non self
neoantigens associated with the tumor and permitting the

In the last years the modulation of immune
checkpoint network is becoming an important therapeutic
strategy for anti-cancer treatments. The activation of
immune system able to kill the tumor represents the goal
of cancer immunotherapy [1].
In anti-tumor immune response T lymphocytes
represent the major components. The optimal recognition
of the antigen induces a specific activation of T cells,
followed by the acquisition of the effector function. It
is particularly significant the differentiation of a specific
subset of T cells, the cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs),
that are able to lyse target cells. In cancer, such as in
chronic viral infection, the long exposure to the antigen
leads to a dysfunction of T cells; in particular these cells
lose their proliferation ability and progressively the
capability to release cytokines, to eliminate pathogens and
to kill target cells. This condition represents the state of

expansion of effector T cells able not only to recognize but
also to destroy the tumor. Initial clinical trial results were
exciting, ICI therapy led to tumor regression and improved
survival in a subgroup of metastatic melanoma, lung
carcinoma, renal cell carcinoma and lymphoma patients.
Clinical trials are currently exploring combination
therapies. The first ICIs approved by FDA are directed
against the CTLA-4, programmed death receptor-1 (PD1) and programmed death receptor-1 ligand (PD-L1) [5] .
A distinguishing feature that was observed since the
first report of ICI anti-CTLA-4 treatment in metastatic
melanoma patients is the observation that the responding
patients showed durable complete responses. The response
is maintained for a long time after the end of the treatment
and long time survivors up to ten years and cured patients
are now a reality [6] .
Several factors appear to governate the efficacy
of these treatments. Pre existing endogenous natural or
induced anti tumor immunity is one of the variables that
has been associated with increased response. Interference
with inhibitory pathways in the effector T cells and
concomitant removal of immune-suppressive cells such
as Treg cells are also dominant mechanisms of enhanced
anti-tumor activity [7]. Oncologists have now tested the
powerful potential of ICI treatment in cancer. Activated
T cells unleashed from negative brakes are able to rapidly
find target tumor cells, kill also significant tumor burden
and maintain memory and control of recurrences. In order
to proceed with novel combination of ICI and integration
of these novel treatments with chemo/radiotherapy and
target therapies, oncologists are now focalizing attention
and research efforts on the management of novel array of
immune related toxicities. The new side effects described
for ICI treatments are in fact mainly immune related
and autoimmunity classified, distinct from chemo and
molecular targeted therapy and they have challenged
greatly medical oncologists [8] . The most common
toxicity observed included: diarrohea, colitis, thyroid
disfunction, hypofisitis, liver disorder, dermatologic event
and lung disorder. Altough these immune related side
effects have become maneageable to some extent by the
use of corticosteroid therapy, new predictive indicators
of response and toxicity are necessary to improve the
management and the compliance to immunotherapy.
In this setting among all the fields that are being
explored, the study of the microbiome is showing
interesting results mainly for two reasons, one comes
from recent studies that have addressed the critical role
that microbiome appears to have in the development
of inflammation, cancer and in the integrity of mucosal
immunity and the protection against pathogens. Second
the high frequency of the severe diarrhea and colitis
affecting ICI treated patients confirming a role of gut
microbiome and suggesting possible microbiota influence
on the therapeutic activity/toxicity of ICI immunotherapy.
In this review we discuss the new perspectives on

the involvement of PD-1 and PDL-1 in the cross talk
between gut microbiota and immune fitness and how gut
microbiota impacts on the efficacy of anti-PD-1 and antiPD-L1 treatments in cancer.

PD-1/PD-L1 AXIS: IMMUNOLOGICAL
AND CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS
PD-1 receptor, also called CD279, represents one
of the most important target for immunological therapy.
It is an inhibitory receptor expressed by activated T
lymphocytes, B cells, natural killer T cells (NKT) and
Treg cells [9]. PD-1 is a member of the CD28 co-receptor
family [10] and has a key role in the modulation of T cell
function in peripheral tissue, recognizing PD-L1 and PDL2. Both these ligands are expressed on antigen presenting
cells (APCs); in addition PD-L1 is present also on the
surface of several cells of lymphoid and non lymphoid
tissue and it is expressed by tumor cells [11]. The function
of PD-1 is mainly regulated by its cytoplasmatic domain,
containing an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory
motif (ITIM) and an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based
switch motif (ITSM). When PD-1 recognizes its ligand,
this interaction induces the phosphorylation of the tyrosine
residue in ITSM, recruiting the tyrosine phosphatase
SHP2 that induces the dephosphorylation and inactivation
of Zap70 in T cells, down regulating TCR signaling
activation. Therefore PD-1 down regulating T cell activity,
affects negatively immune response. When in tumor
microenvironment PD-1 binds PD-L1, T cell function is
attenuated, so that T lymphocytes become unable to target
tumor cells. Hence anti-tumor response results strongly
restrained and tumor evasion favored. Initially the role
of PD-1 in modulating T cell activity was described in
chronic viral infection. It was shown that during chronic
infection of LCMV all specific CD8+ T cells expressed PD1, instead during acute infection this receptor has not been
detected on LCMV-specific memory CD8+ T cells. [12].
Since the interaction between PD-1/PD-L1 can be blocked
by monoclonal antibodies, these are now considered
novel therapeutic approaches to unleash the anti-tumor
immune response. In fact it has been strongly suggested
that immune evasion of cancer can be favored by the
expression of PD-1 by tumor infiltrating lymphocytes
(TILs) along with the expression of PD-L1 by tumor cells
[13]. Many studies have shown that blockade of PD-1 or
PD-L1 restores T cell function, induce an increase of IFNγ
[14] and a decrease of immune suppressive cell subsets,
such as MDSCs [15]. In fact PD-1 and PD-L1 blocking
represents an extremely efficient approach in controlling
tumor growth by changing the dynamic of the tumor
microenvironment. Currently different monoclonal anti
PD-1 and anti-PD-L1 antibodies are in development for
the treatment of advanced disease; they include Nivolumab
(OPDIVO, anti-PD 1) [16-23], Pembrolizumab (Keytruda,
anti-PD-1) [24-34], Atezolizumab (anti PD-L1)[35-36] ,

Durvalumab (anti-PDL-1)[37-38] and many others. These
agents while are revolutionizing cancer patients care[39] ,
have a precise pattern of toxicity, that can be classified as
immune related. It is important today to understand better
the variability observed in patient outcomes together with
strategies to improve efficacy and identify parameters to
select responsive patients. Microbiota could represent
one physiological mechanism that can influence and
modulate response to ICI treatments. The involvement of
gut microbiota in the outcome of anti cancer therapy and
the role of immune response create new questions from a
preclinical and clinical standpoint in the cancer field [40] .

production of Th17 and Th1 cells [63], demonstrating
that bacteria modulate chemotherapeutic drug efficacy.
Furthermore in tumor bearing mice the perturbation of
intestinal microbiota caused by antibiotics treatment is
associated with the reduction of synthesis of cytokines
and the decreasing effect of both CPG- oligonucleotides
immunotherapy and chemotherapy. It was demonstrated
that microbiome is also with inflammation modyfing the
expression of gene involved.[64]. In this study the authors
show that different microbiota profiles are associated
with the TNF response. In particular the presence of
Ruminococcus ( Gram negative), and Alistipes ( Grampositive) is involved in TNF production , while an
enriched Lactobacillus microbiota correlates with the fail
of response.
Thus microbiota may have a crucial role in
influencing cancer treatment efficacy and considering
the close interaction with immune system it’s reasonable
to supposed its influence in response to ICIs or other
immunotherapies.
In fact recently Vetizou et al. [65] demonstrated
that germ free or antiobiotics treated mice had poor
benefit from anti-CTLA-4 therapy and showed also
that anti-CTLA-4 therapy can modify the composition
of microbiota. Moreover a recent study established that
microbiota composition enriched in Bacteroides phlilym
can prevent the onset of immune colitis in patients treated
with anti-CTLA-4 (Ipilimumab) [66]. This data support
the idea that microbiota modifying immune response
could influence the response of both chemotherapy
and immunotherapy (Table 1).[67-72] Furthermore the
microbiota profiles already studied in IBD and liver
diseases could be useful to stratify cancer patients treated
with ICIs [73-80].

MICROBIOME AND CANCER
Gut microbiota complexity and behaviour
deserve the definition of tissue organ, as introduced and
thoroughly discussed by Burcelin and collaborators [41], a
major immunological organ which means metabolic organ,
that influences different pathways of whole metabolism.
Therefore the intricacy of microbiota components,
metabolic functions and signaling control of the host
leads to revise the concept of gut-host relationship in term
of gut-microbiota-host network. In particular there is a
close relationship between the acquisition of microbiome
and the maturation of immune system during ontogeny.
Intestinal homeostasis is then maintained through an
efficient and interacting immune network that permits
tolerance to the microbiota while allowing responsiveness
to invading pathogens. Different members of the
microbiota and their components have been demonstrated
to interact with specific immune components influencing
the synthesis of regulatory cytokines.
The final decision towards tolerance vs reactivity is
the result of integrated signals from the microbiota and
immune/non immune cells in the local microenvironment
[42] . The perturbation of gut microbiota, called intestinal
dysbiosis, is involved in many pathological mechanisms.
Recent studies demonstrated the associations between
microbiota profiles and the development of adiposity,
diabetes, dyslipidemia and other inflammatory conditions.
[43-48]
The close association between cancer susceptibility
[49-61], responsiveness to cancer therapy and microbiome
has just been investigated. Infact it was shown that the
production of IL-17 in response to change of microbiota
composition is associated to rapid progression of colorectal cancer. Furthermore enteric bacterial genes
metabolizing estrogens could modify the risk to develop
hormone positive breast cancer in postmenopausal
women. [62]
Recentely
it
was
demonstrated
that
cyclophosphamide changes composition of microbiota and
induces traslocation of bacteria (Lactobacillus jonsoniii
and Enterococco hirae) in secondary lymphoids organ,
like spleen and mesenteric lymph nodes, stimulating the

MICROBIOME AND PD1-PD-L1 AXIS
It’s known that PD1-PDL1 axis plays a key role in
the regulation of immune system and that immunotherapy
is more efficient in T cell inflamed tumors rather than in T
cell deficient tumors. Recent data support the hypothesis
that microbiota shapes innate and adaptive immune
system influencing PD-1-PD-L1 axis. In particular Sivan
et al compared melanoma growth in mice derived from
two different mouse facilities (JAX and TAC) harboring
different intestinal microbiota but genetically similar
[81]. They observed an higher rate of melanoma growth
in TAC mice and a better response to PD-L1 treatment
in JAX mice. Moreover the investigated the relationship
between microbiota and immune cells demonstrating that
Bifidobaterium seems to positively influence the number
of activated antingen-presenting cells. Moreover the
administration of Bifidobacterium to TAC mice improves
tumor control and IFNγ production. Surprisingly the
authors demonstrated that the combination of modulation
of microbiota with anti-PD-L1 antibody improved tumor

control. These data are very exciting because strongly
suggest that different species can activate or conversely
inhibit immune response.
Moreover the microbiota influences the development
of regulatory T cells in mice, in particular germ free
mice showed a lower amount of suppressive Foxp3+
Treg cells in the gut and the colonization of Clostridium
species or Bacteroides fragilis stimulates the induction
of suppressive Foxp3+ Treg cells in the intestine of these
mice [82]. Furthermore neonatal human CD4+ T cells can
be converted into Foxp3+ Treg cells by Staphylococcus
aureus.
In fact S.aureus increases the expression of PD-L1
on APCs, and this is linked to the APCs ability to induce
Foxp3+ Tregs. The interaction between PD-L1 and PD-1,
expressed on T cells, prevents the TCR signaling within
T cells, which leads to differentiation into Foxp3+ Tregs.

These data demonstrate a significant role of
specific gut bacteria in influencing immune system and
response to cancer therapies. But it’s equally true that the
gut microbiota is itself modulated by immune response.
In fact intestinal microbiota plays a crucial role in the
development of gut immune system representing one of the
first barrier against pathogens. Germ free mice presented
reduced Pejer’s patches, levels of immunoglobulin
A, intraepithelial lymphocytes and production of
antimicrobial peptide. It was also demonstrated that
recolonization with healthy mouse commensal microbiota
can correct the immune deficiency.
Fargarsan showed that PD-1-/- mice have a
significant alteration in microbiota composition
(reduction of anaerobic bacteria, of Bifidobacterium
and Bacteroidaceae, increase in Enterobacteriaceae
and at the general level, increase in members of the

Erysipelotrichaceae, Prevotellaceae, Alcaligenaceae and
TM7 genera incertae sedis) and it’s supposed to be caused
by a decreased capacity of IgA of binding bacteria[83].
Thus PD-1 is strongly associated with the maturation of
antibody to maintain the integrity of intestinal mucosal
barrier [84] .
One accredited hypothesis, proposed by Rescigno
speculates that the immune system can be manipulated to
alter gut microbiota composition. In this way microbiota
could be induced to be less pro-inflammatory (i.e. more
diverse and with a reduced level of innate immune
activators), thus reducing susceptibility to inflammation
or minimizing the progression of the damage [85-90].

There is no conflict of interest.

The main challenge today for the oncologists is to
fully utilize the potential of ICI treatment in order to treat
and cure the majority of patients, to limit the immune
related events and toxicity and to better understand the
dynamics of response to treatment. It is conceivable that
in a very short time ICI treatment will be proposed for
all tumors and in earlier setting in the different protocols.
In this review we outline several recent findings that
could help to draw a roadmap of clinical and laboratory
criteria to help the oncologist in designing more efficient
protocols of ICIs treatment (Figure 1). We hypothesize
that the identification of different microbiome profiles
(for example Bifidus enriched or Bacterioides enriched)
could help us to establish classes of patients responders
or at major risk to develop high grade toxicities. To better
define the profile of our patients we could also consider the
nutritional status and immune repertoire. The possibility of
intervention is attractive. In fact diet, use of probiotics,
prebiotics and antibiotics or stool transfer that can change
microbiota profile, drugs that can modulate mucosal
permeability and homeostasis as well as pretreatment
immunotherapy/chemotherapy to increase the specific
anti tumor T cell compartment are some of the strategies.
We are today dealing with oncology treatments that have
moved the attention from the tumor to the patients immune
system and the multiple intersecting immunity regulatory
networks. The further understanding of these mechanisms
and the relation with clinical outcome will be the key
for the development of protocols and guidelines for ICI
treatment with maximized curative potential.
