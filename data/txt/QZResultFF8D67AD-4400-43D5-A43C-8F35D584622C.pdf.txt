BACKGROUND: Paclitaxel interacts with microtubules to exert therapeutic effects. Molecules that affect
microtubule activity, such as bIII-tubulin and stathmin, may interfere with the treatment. In this study, the
authors analyzed bIII-tubulin and stathmin expression in ovarian tumors and examined their associations
with treatment response and patient survival. METHODS: The study included 178 patients with epithelial
ovarian cancer who underwent cytoreductive surgery followed by platinum-based chemotherapy; of these
patients, 75 also received paclitaxel. Fresh tumor samples that were collected at surgery were analyzed for
messenger RNA expression of bIII-tubulin and stathmin using real-time polymerase chain reaction analysis.
Associations of these molecules with treatment response, disease progression, and overall survival were
evaluated. RESULTS: High stathmin expression was associated with worse disease progression-free and
overall survival compared with low stathmin expression. This association was independent of patient age,
disease stage, tumor grade, histology, and residual tumor size and was observed in patients who received
platinum plus paclitaxel, but not in patients who received platinum without paclitaxel, suggesting that
stathmin expression in tumor tissue may interfere with paclitaxel treatment. Similar effects were not
observed for bIII-tubulin, although high bIII-tubulin expression was associated with disease progression
among patients who received platinum without paclitaxel. No associations were observed between treatment response and tubulin or stathmin expression. Expression levels of bIII-tubulin and stathmin were correlated significantly. CONCLUSIONS: High stathmin expression predicted an unfavorable prognosis in
patients with ovarian cancer who received paclitaxel and platinum chemotherapy. This finding supports the
possibility that stathmin may interfere with paclitaxel treatment, leading to a poor prognosis for patients

experience disease progression.2,3 Intrinsic and acquired
drug resistance contribute to poor clinical outcomes;
more research is needed to elucidate their mechanisms.
Proposed mechanisms for tumor resistance to platinum
and paclitaxel include molecular and genetic changes in
DNA repair genes,4 multidrug resistance genes,5,6 apoptotic regulatory genes,7,8 and microtubule stability and
dynamics.9,10 Recently, several studies have indicated that
excision repair cross-complementation group 1 (ERCC1),
a DNA repair gene, is a predictive marker for platinumbased chemotherapy.11,12 Our previous research also
produced similar results among patients with ovarian
cancer who received platinum without paclitaxel. However, for patients who received both platinum and paclitaxel, the effect of ERCC1 was not observed.13 Thus,
molecular and genetic factors that may influence patient
response to paclitaxel also should be considered and
investigated.
Microtubules are dynamic a/b-tubulin heterodimers that function in cell division, intracellular transport, maintenance of cell shape, and cellular motility.14
Paclitaxel induces mitotic arrest and cell death when it
binds and stabilizes b-tubulin in microtubules.15 Identification of the paclitaxel binding site in b-tubulin has led to
the hypothesis that structural alterations in this protein
may contribute to paclitaxel resistance.16 Over expression
of 1 isotype, bIII-tubulin, has been associated with paclitaxel resistance in mammalian cell lines17 and with poor
survival in patients with ovarian cancer.18 Stathmin is
another protein that may play a role in paclitaxel resistance, because it regulates microtubule dynamics by
preventing tubulin polymerization and promoting microtubule destabilization and disassembly.14 High stathmin
expression has been observed in paclitaxel-resistant ovarian cancer cell lines19 and has been associated with tumor
progression and poor prognosis in hepatocellular carcinoma20 and oral squamous cell carcinoma.21 However,
few clinical studies have examined the role of stathmin
expression in the treatment and survival of patients
with ovarian cancer. In the current study, we evaluated
bIII-tubulin and stathmin messenger RNA (mRNA)
expression in ovarian tumors that were collected from
patients who received platinum-based chemotherapy with
or without paclitaxel. We speculated that high levels of
bIII-tubulin and stathmin expression would adversely
affect patient response to chemotherapy involving

paclitaxel and would be associated with poor survival
outcomes.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study Patients
A clinical study of ovarian cancer was conducted in the
Gynecologic Oncology Unit at the University of Turin in
Italy between October 1991 and February 2000. From a
consecutive series of 212 patients who were diagnosed
with primary epithelial ovarian cancer, we identified 178
patients who received postoperative platinum-based
chemotherapy with or without paclitaxel. The median age
of patients at surgery was 57.4 years (range, 26-82 years).
Thirty-three of 178 patients (18.5%) were diagnosed with
stage I disease, 12 patients (6.7%) had stage II disease,
120 patients (67.4%) had stage III disease, and 13 patients
(7.3%) had stage IV disease. Disease staging was classified
according to International Federation of Gynecology and
Obstetrics criteria.22 On the basis of World Health Organization (WHO) criteria,23 histologic tumor types
included serous, endometrioid, mucinous, clear cell, and
other epithelial tumors. For data analysis, tumor histotypes were grouped into serous (43.3%; n ¼ 77) and nonserous (56.7%; n ¼ 101). Most patients (68%; n ¼ 121)
had grade 3 tumors (poorly differentiated), and a few
patients had grade 2 tumors (19.1%; n ¼ 34) and grade 1
tumors (12.9%; n ¼ 23). Debulking results, which were
evaluated after surgical cytoreduction, were optimal for
87 patients (48.9%) and suboptimal (residual lesions >1
cm) for 91 patients (51.1%). This study was approved by
an ethical review committee at the University of Turin,
and all patients provided consent to participate.
After surgery, all patients received platinum-based
chemotherapy: 75 patients also received paclitaxel
(42.1%), whereas 103 patients were treated without paclitaxel (57.9%). For patients who were treated between
1991 and 1995, cisplatin 75 mg/m2 and cyclophosphamide 750 mg/m2 were used every 3 weeks for 6 cycles as
the standard of care except for patients who had allergic
reactions or medical contraindications and patients who
were on experimental protocols. From 1996 to 2001, after
the introduction of paclitaxel as a standard of care, the
treatment was changed to paclitaxel 175 mg/m2 (3 hours
infusion) and carboplatinum at an area under the

concentration time curve of 5 or 6, every 3 weeks for 6
cycles. Patient response to chemotherapy was evaluated 1
month after the last cycle of treatment through clinical examination, imaging, and serum CA-125. For measurable
disease, treatment response was assessed according to
WHO criteria.24 A complete response (CR) required the
complete disappearance of all measurable lesions, whereas
a partial response (PR) was defined as a reduction 50%
in the size of measurable lesions. Stable disease (SD) was
defined as a decrease <50% or an increase 25% in the
size of measurable lesions, and progressive disease (PD)
was defined as either an increase >25% in the size of
measurable lesions or the appearance of new lesions. For
nonmeasurable disease, progression was defined as a doubling of CA-125 from the upper limit of normal.25 For
data analysis, patients who had a PR, SD, and PD were
grouped together as poor responders and were compared
with patients who had a CR. Of the 178 patients in the
study, 71.9% (n ¼ 128) had a CR to treatment, and
27% (n ¼ 48) had poor response, which included 36
with PRs, 4 patients with SD, and 8 patients with PD.
Two patients (1.1%) had no information on treatment
response. Patients were followed from surgery through
June 2001 for survival outcome. The median overall survival, which we defined as the time between the date of
surgery and the date of either death or last contact, was
37.5 months (range, 0.6-114.1 months). The median
disease progression-free survival from the date of surgery
to the date of first local recurrence, distant metastasis,
death without recurrence, or last contact was 19.8
months (range, 0.6-108.8 months). During follow-up,
92 patients (51.7%) experienced disease progression;
among them, 67 patients died, and 25 patients survived
for the duration of the study. Of the 86 patients (48.3%)
without disease progression, 18 patients died without
remission, and 68 patients survived for the duration of
the study.
Tissue Analysis
Fresh tumor samples were collected during surgery. The
specimens were snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored
at 80 C until analysis. Representative samples from
each tissue specimen were examined in frozen section by 2
pathologists to confirm tumor content; the content of tumor cells in these specimens ranged between 80% and
90%. RNeasy Mini Kits (QIAGEN Inc., Valencia, Calif)

were used to extract total RNA from 20 mg of tissue that
was pulverized manually in liquid nitrogen. RNA (5 ng)
was reverse transcribed to complementary DNA (cDNA)
using SuperScript First-Strand Synthesis System for
reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (PCR)
(Invitrogen Corp., Carlsbad, Calif). Quantitative realtime PCR was performed to determine levels of stathmin
and bIII-tubulin mRNA expression in each tumor sample
by using glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase
(GAPDH) as an endogenous control. Plasmids that contained cloned sequences of stathmin, bIII-tubulin, and
GAPDH were used as the standards for quantitative PCR.
The primers for cloned sequences were designed online
(available at: http://www.idtdna.com accessed on March
11, 2009) and were ordered from Integrated DNA Technologies, Inc. (Coralville, Iowa). The primer sequences
were: AAA TGG CTG CCA AAC TGG AAC GT (stathmin forward), GCT TCA GTC TCG TCA GCA GGG
TC (stathmin reverse), ACA GCA GCT ACT TCG
TGG AGT GGA TC (bIII-tubulin forward), GTC TTC
GTA CAT CTC GCC CTC TTC C (bIII-tubulin
reverse), GAA GGT GAA GGT CGG AGT C (GAPDH
forward), and GAA GAT GGT GAT GGG ATT TC
(GAPDH reverse). Purified PCR products (3 lL) were
ligated to pGEM-T Easy Vector and incubated at 4 C
overnight (Promega Corp., Madison, Wis). The ligation
products (5 mL) were transfected into 50 lL of subcloning efficiency DH5 alpha competent Escherichia coli cells
(Invitrogen Corp.). After overnight incubation at 37 C,
plasmid DNA was purified using the QIAprep MiniPrep
Kit (Qiagen Inc., Valencia, Calif), and the purified plasmid was digested by EcoR1 to confirm the size of the
inserted DNA. After measuring the concentration of purified DNA, gene copy numbers were calculated according
to the following formula: (concentration  volume)/(size
of DNA insert  660) 
(6.02  1023). Cloned DNA templates were serially
diluted to contain copy numbers ranging from 1.0  108
to 1.0  1012 per lL.
Quantitative real-time PCR was carried out using
the ABI 7500 real-time PCR system (Applied Biosystems
Inc., Foster City, Calif). The PCR reaction solution (25
lL) contained 5 ng/lL cDNA, 12.5 lL Power SYBR
Green PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems Inc.), and a
pair of primers at a final concentration of 5 lM for stathmin, bIII-tubulin, or GAPDH. Thermal cycling

expression was not correlated with these clinical features,
but high stathmin expression was associated with high
bIII-tubulin expression (P < .001). Stathmin expression
in ovarian tumors was greater than bIII-tubulin in ovarian
tumors (1.29 vs 0.06) (Table 2). Like the results shown in
Table 1, stathmin and bIII-tubulin expression did not differ by disease stage (stage I/II vs stage III/IV) or tumor
grade (grade 1/2 vs grade 3) (Table 2). In addition, expression levels did not differ according to the presence or absence of residual tumor or according to debulking results
(optimal vs suboptimal) (Table 2). Stathmin expression,
however, was greater in nonserous tumors than in serous
tumors (2.01 vs 0.90; P ¼ .007), but no difference

Patients who had a CR versus a poor response to
treatment did not have different stathmin or bIII-tubulin
expression levels (Table 2). Survival analysis, however,
indicated that different levels of stathmin expression were
associated with disease progression-free survival and overall
survival (Table 3). Patients who had high stathmin levels
had an elevated risk of disease progression and death compared with patients who had low stathmin expression levels. The hazard ratio (HR) was 2.43 (95% confidence
interval [CI], 1.41-4.19) for disease progression and 2.77
(95% CI, 1.53-5.04) for death, and the trend linking
increasing stathmin levels with risk also was statistically significant for both outcomes (P  .001) (Table 3). Furthermore, an analysis stratified by treatment indicated that
these associations applied only to patients who received
both platinum and paclitaxel. The strength of the association was substantial in these patients; the HRs reached as
high as 4.87 (95% CI, 1.69-14.05) and 7.81 (95% CI,
2.32-26.25), respectively (Table 3). Similar survival differences were not observed for patients who received platinum without paclitaxel. These analyses were adjusted for
patient age, disease stage, tumor grade, histology, and residual tumor size. Kaplan-Meier survival curves indicated
that platinum and paclitaxel-treated patients who had medium or high stathmin expression had worse progressionfree survival (Fig. 4, top) and overall survival (Fig. 5, top)
than patients who had low expression, but no differences
were observed for patients who received platinum without
paclitaxel (Fig. 4, bottom; Fig. 5, bottom).
Although bIII-tubulin expression also was associated
with survival outcome, the association was observed only

DISCUSSION
Recently, much attention has been given to the connection between microtubule dynamics and paclitaxel resistance, underscoring the importance of proteins that
interact with microtubules, including stathmin and bIIItubulin.9,10 Previous studies linked elevated levels of
stathmin to paclitaxel resistance in ovarian,19 breast,26
and lung cancer cell lines,10 but few investigated the role
of stathmin expression in paclitaxel resistance in vivo. In
the current study, we examined the association between
stathmin and clinical outcome in patients with ovarian

cancer who received platinum-based chemotherapy with
and without paclitaxel. It is noteworthy that, in our study,
stathmin expression was not related to treatment response
but was associated with disease progression and overall
survival. After adjusting for patient age, disease stage, tumor grade and histology, and residual tumor status, the
risk of disease progression and death was elevated significantly in patients who had high stathmin expression, and
the association was more evident in patients who received
both platinum and paclitaxel, but not in patients who
received platinum without paclitaxel. This discrepancy in
association by paclitaxel treatment suggests that this
drug’s therapeutic effect may be affected by the level of
stathmin expression.
Patient response to cancer treatment has been considered an early prognostic indicator, based on the
assumption that patients who initially respond well to
treatment will have better survival outcomes.27 However,
early favorable response to treatment does not always
translate into long-term survival benefits; patients with
similar response to initial treatment can experience differCancer

ent survival over time. The relation between treatment
response and survival also varies from study to study
because of inconsistent clinical definitions and protocols
for treatment and evaluation of response.28 In the current
study, treatment response was evaluated 1 month after
patients received chemotherapy. It is possible that the
treatment response was assessed too soon to be relevant to
survival outcomes. Additional complexity in clinical and
pathologic variations among patients also may have contributed to our inability to detect associations between
stathmin and treatment response, although stathmin was
related to survival outcomes.
Although adding paclitaxel to platinum-based
chemotherapy as first-line treatment has improved patient
survival, the improvement is limited. Some patients who
initially respond to the treatment still develop drug resistance and eventually die of the disease. Thus, understanding the molecular mechanisms that are responsible for
paclitaxel resistance is critical to further improving the efficacy of chemotherapy. Paclitaxel is an antitumor agent
which is believed to exert its cytotoxic effect through

FIGURE 5. Kaplan-Meier overall survival curves according to
stathmin levels: (Top) Among the patients who received both

stabilizing microtubules. Paclitaxel can enhance the polymerization of tubulin and bind directly to b-tubulin to
disturb the formation of mitotic apparatus, leading to mitotic arrest and cells death.15 Conversely, stathmin is a
microtubule-destabilizing protein that regulates microtubule dynamics by preventing tubulin polymerization and
promoting microtubule disassembly during cell cycle progression.14,29 Thus, up-regulation of stathmin expression
may disturb microtubule stabilization and thereby may
overcome the effect of paclitaxel on microtubule polymerization. In addition to its role in microtubule dynamics,
stathmin is involved in the regulation of cell proliferation,
differentiation, and cell motility, which also may affect tumor progression.30,31
Our findings suggest that stathmin mRNA expression is a strong predictor of ovarian cancer survival after
standard platinum and paclitaxel treatment. This finding
may be explained by several plausible mechanisms, and
paclitaxel resistance is 1 of the possibilities. Previously, it

was demonstrated that 2 paclitaxel-resistant ovarian cancer
cell lines had stathmin overexpression, implicating stathmin involvement in tumor response to paclitaxel treatment.19 In addition, overexpression of stathmin in breast
cancer cell lines decreased microtubule polymerization and
caused cell cycle arrest at G2 phase, markedly reducing the
binding ability of paclitaxel to microtubules.26 In the same
breast cancer cells, inhibition of stathmin by RNA interference induced microtubule polymerization, promoted cell
cycle progression from G2 to M phase, and increased cell
sensitivity to paclitaxel, suggesting the involvement of
stathmin in the efficacy of antimicrotubule therapies.32
Recent experiments demonstrated that stathmin suppression plus taxol exposure had stronger inhibitory effects
than either 1 of the factors on prostate cancer cell proliferation and angiogenesis, presenting further evidence that
stathmin may interfere with the therapeutic effect of taxol
on cancer cells.33,34 Our observation of an association
between stathmin expression and ovarian cancer survival

supports the notion that stathmin may be involved in tumor resistance to paclitaxel therapy. Disease traits, such as
tumor aggressiveness and metastatic potential, may affect
stathmin expression. Although we did not detect a significant association between stathmin expression and clinical
or pathologic factors, previous studies have linked stathmin expression to tumor grade, clinical stage, disease progression, and poor prognosis in breast and lung cancers,
suggesting that the effect of stathmin may be more global
than a specific interaction with paclitaxel would
suggest.35,36
In the current study, we also observed that bIII-tubulin expression was associated with ovarian cancer survival,
but the association was limited to progression-free survival
among patients who received platinum without paclitaxel.
Although we predicted that bIII-tubulin expression would
be associated with survival for all patients, it is interesting
to note that inconsistent associations also were observed in
previous studies. Previously, bIII-tubulin expression was
identified as a prognostic factor for patients with various
forms of cancer. The overexpression of bIII-tubulin has
been associated with poor survival in patients with gastric
cancer,37 breast cancer,38 nonsmall cell lung cancer,39 and
ovarian cancer.18 However, a recent study of patients with
cervical cancer was unable to detect any significant association between bIII-tubulin expression and treatment
response or survival.40 Prior research also has linked
bIII-tubulin overexpression with paclitaxel resistance in
patients with breast cancer,41 nonsmall cell lung cancer,42,43 and ovarian cancer.44 In vitro studies have suggested that high bIII-tubulin expression may contribute to
paclitaxel resistance by reducing microtubule assembly
and preventing paclitaxel from suppressing microtubule
dynamics.9,45 Although bIII-tubulin overexpression has
been associated with paclitaxel resistance in prostate cancer
cells46 and ovarian cancer tumors,47 no association could
be detected in ovarian cancer xenografts.17 These conflicting findings and the null results observed in our study suggest that the role of bIII-tubulin expression in paclitaxel
resistance, treatment response, and survival should be
examined further in vitro and in vivo.
Although the underlying mechanism remains
unknown, our study has suggested that stathmin mRNA
expression is an important prognostic indicator for
patients with ovarian cancer who are treated with paclitaxel and platinum chemotherapy. In this study, high levCancer

els of stathmin were associated significantly with shorter
disease progression-free and overall survival. These findings suggest that stathmin may interfere with platinum
and paclitaxel treatment, and they highlight the clinical
importance of investigating the effect of this molecule on
paclitaxel treatment in patients with ovarian cancer.
