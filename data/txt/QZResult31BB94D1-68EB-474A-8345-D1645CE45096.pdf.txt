Abstract
Chorein encoded by VPS13A (vacuolar protein sorting-associated protein 13A)
is defective in chorea-acanthocytosis. Chorein fosters neuronal cell survival, cortical
actin polymerization and cell stiffness. In view of its anti-apoptotic effect in neurons,
we explored whether chorein is expressed in cancer cells and influences cancer cell
survival. RT-PCR was employed to determine transcript levels, specific siRNA to
silence chorein, FACS analysis to follow apoptosis and Western blotting to quantify
protein abundance. Chorein transcripts were detected in various cancer cell types. The
mRNA coding for chorein and chorein protein were most abundant in drug resistant,
poorly differentiated human rhabdomyosarcoma cells. Chorein silencing significantly
reduced the ratio of phosphorylated (and thus activated) to total phosphoinositide 3
kinase (PI-3K), pointing to inactivation of this crucial pro-survival signaling molecule.
Moreover, chorein silencing diminished transcript levels and protein expression of
anti-apoptotic BCL-2 and enhanced transcript levels of pro-apoptotic Bax. Silencing
of chorein in rhabdomyosarcoma cells was followed by mitochondrial depolarization,
caspase 3 activation and stimulation of early and late apoptosis. In conclusion,
chorein is expressed in various cancer cells. In cells with high chorein expression
levels chorein silencing promotes apoptotic cell death, an effect paralleled by downregulation of PI-3K activity and BCL-2/Bax expression ratio.

Introduction

autosomal recessive genetic disease [4-9] characterized
by progressive hyperkinetic movement disorder,
cognitive dysfunction, behavioral abnormalities, chronic
hyperkalemia and variable acanthocytosis of red blood
cells [5, 10]. Gene-targeted mice lacking chorein display
erythrocyte shape changes [11], apoptosis of neurons [12]
and behavioral abnormalities [12].
Chorein expression is not restricted to brain and
erythrocytes, but is observed in diverse further tissues
[13-15]. Chorein in blood platelets participates in the
regulation of secretion and aggregation [15]. Moreover,
chorein expressed in endothelial cells contributes to the
regulation of endothelial cell stiffness [14]. Clearly, much

Chorein is a powerful regulator of cytoskeletal
architecture and cell survival [1]. The protein interacts
with phosphoinositide-3-kinase (PI3K)-p85-subunit and
probably sensitizes the PI3K-p85-subunit to tyrosine
phosphorylation [1-3]. Presumably by up-regulation of
PI3K activity chorein leads to activation of Rac1 and
PAK1, triggers polymerization of cortical actin, fosters
phosphorylation of Bad, and counteracts mitochondrial
depolarization [1]. Loss-of-function mutations of VPS13A
(vacuolar protein sorting-associated protein 13A), the gene
encoding chorein, lead to chorea-acanthocytosis (CA), an

protein.
In view of the anti-apoptotic effect of chorein, we
explored whether chorein is expressed in tumor cells and,
if so, whether it modifies the survival of those cells. To
this end, the chorein transcript and protein levels were
determined in several tumor cells. As a result, chorein
is expressed in some tumor cells with highest transcript
levels found in ZF rhabdomyosarcoma cells. The impact
of chorein on the survival of those cells was elucidated by
chorein silencing and subsequent analysis of apoptosis and
apoptotic signaling.

of those cells. As illustrated in Fig.1A, chorein is
expressed in several tumor cell lines. mRNA coding for
chorein was predominantly transcribed in drug resistant,
poorly differentiated ZF rhabdomyosarcoma cells (Fig.
1A). Other cancer cell lines such as the human colon
carcinoma CaCo2 cells expressed significantly lower
levels of chorein (Fig. 1A). The differences in chorein
transcript levels between ZF rhabdomyosarcoma cells
and CaCo2 cells were paralleled by similar differences in
protein expression. Accordimg to both, Western-blot and
confocal scanning analysis chorein protein expression was
markedly higher in ZF rhabdomyosarcoma cells than in
CaCo2 cells (Fig, 2). According to confocal microscopy
chorein protein is mainly localized in the cytoplasm (Fig.
2B).
In order to determine the functional significance
of chorein, the chorein transcription has been suppressed
by silencing. The silencing efficacy is shown in Fig. 1A,

Suppl. Figs 1A and 2A. Fig. 1C illustrates the impact
of chorein silencing on PI-3K phosphorylation. In ZF
rhabdomyosarcoma cells chorein silencing decreased
the ratio of phosphorylated to total PI-3K significantly,
implying chorein sensitive phosphorylation of this crucial
pro-survival signaling molecule. For comparison, chorein
silencing had little effect on PI-3K phosphorylation in
CaCo2 cells (Suppl. Fig. 1B).
Additional experiments addressed the impact of
chorein on the expression of anti-apoptotic protein B-cell
lymphoma 2 (BCL-2) and of pro-apoptotic protein Bax.
As illustrated in Fig. 3A, chorein silencing significantly
decreased the BCL-2 (Fig. 3A) and increased the Bax
(Fig. 3B) transcript levels in ZF rhabdomyosarcoma cells.
Furthermore, chorein silencing decreased the BCL-2
protein abundance in ZF rhabdomyosarcoma cells (Fig.
3C).
Caspase 3 activity was determined to elucidate
whether chorein influenced apoptotic signaling. As
illustrated in Fig. 4A, chorein silencing significantly

enhanced caspase-3 activity in ZF rhabdomyosarcoma
cells, an observation pointing to triggering of apoptosis.
In line with this observation, chorein silencing of ZF
rhabdomyosarcoma cells was followed by significant
mitochondrial depolarization (Fig. 4B). Mitochondrial
depolarization reached statistical significance already 24
h after chorein silencing and persisted throughout 72 h
(Suppl. Fig. 2C).
Apoptosis was evidenced from Annexin V and
propidium iodide binding. As illustrated in Fig. 5A, B,
chorein significantly enhanced the percentage of ZF
rhabdomyosarcoma cells in early or late apoptosis. In
contrast, chorein silencing of Caco2 cells (Fig. Suppl.
Fig. 1A), which express only low levels of chorein
(demonstrated in Fig. 1A) had almost no effect on
apoptosis of these cells (Fig. 6A,B).
Additional experiments addressed the effect of
separate and combined chorein silencing and treatment
with the cytotoxic drug Doxorubicin (500 nM). As shown
in Suppl. Fig. 3, both, chorein silencing and doxorubicin

spleen and brain [13]. Apparently, function and survival
of neurons and skeletal muscle cells are particularly
dependent on chorein [5, 10]. According to the present
observations, some tumor cells similarly depend on
chorein expression for survival. A more detailed analysis
is expected to disclose chorein sensitive functions and
survival of further cell types.
In view of the present observations, the lack
of chorein in chorea-acanthocytosis may confer
some protection against the development of specific
malignancies. It is tempting to speculate that
pharmacological interference with the interaction between
chorein and PI3K may enhance the susceptibility of
chorein rich tumor cells to treatment. PI3K inhibitors
are effective in the treatment of malignancy but create
considerable side effects due to disruption of the multiple
PI3K dependent cellular functions [27, 64]. Chorein
inhibition would not be expected to completely disrupt
PIK3 signaling and compromise function and survival
only of those cells expressing high levels of chorein and
depending on chorein sensitive PI3K signaling. Along
those lines complete lack of chorein in patients suffering
from chorea-acanthocytosis requires decades to generate
clinically relevant disorders [4-9].
In conclusion, the present observations reveal a
novel function of chorein, i.e. the stimulation of tumor
cell survival. Future studies will be required to define the
impact of chorein expression on malignancy and therapy
resistance of defined malignancies.

treatment are followed by triggering of apoptosis.
However, the combined treatment with chorein silencing
and doxorubicin did not lead to further significant increase
of apoptosis (Suppl. Fig. 3A middle). Chorein silencing
did not significantly modify FITC dextran uptake (Suppl.
Fig. 4).

Discussion
The present study discloses a completely novel
regulator of tumor cell survival, i.e. chorein, the protein
which is defective in patients with chorea-acanthocytosis.
We show that chorein is expressed in several tumor
cell lines with particularly high expression in ZF
rhabdomyosarcoma cells. We further show that survival
of those cells, but not of colon carcinoma cells with low
levels of chorein expression is highly sensitive to the
presence of chorein.
The present study further sheds some light on the
mechanisms accounting for the impact of chorein on
tumor cell survival. Chorein interacts with PI3K [2, 3]
and chorein silencing decreases the phosphorylation of
the PI3K-subunit-p85 in ZF rhabdomyosarcoma cells.
The effect of chorein on PI3K is an example of “protein”
addiction, whereby sudden abrogation of an anti-apoptotic
protein causes apoptosis due to activation of caspases [1619]
PI3K signaling counteracts apoptosis of a wide
variety of cells including cancer cells [20-34] and
neurons [35-38]. The present observations further reveal
that chorein silencing stimulates the transcription of
Bax, which is a powerful stimulator of apoptosis [39].
Chorein silencing further inhibits both, the transcription
and protein expression of BCL-2, a potent inhibitor of
apoptosis [40, 41]. The present study did not address
the mechanisms accounting for altered BCL-2 and
Bax expression following chorein silencing. At least
in theory, the effect may again involve PI3K signaling,
which leads to inhibition of FOXO transcription factors,
powerful regulators of BCL-2 and Bax expression
and activity [42-44]. Bax and BCL-2 are effective by
influencing mitochondrial potential [45]. Accordingly,
chorein silencing triggers mitochondrial depolarization.
The stimulation of apoptosis by chorein silencing further
involves activation of caspases, apoptosis executing
enzymes [46-54].
Besides its effect on cell survival, chorein stabilizes
the cortical actin filament network [1] thus influencing
cell shape, exocytosis, membrane blebbing and receptor
function [1, 55-63]. It remains to be shown whether the
effect of chorein on actin cytoskeleton impacts on cell
motility.
In view of the extra-cerebral expression and
functions of chorein, chorea-acanthocytosis is a systemic
disease presumably affecting a wide variety of functions.
Chorein expression is particularly high in testis, kidney,

Materials and Methods
Cells
Chorein transcript levels were determined
in ZF rhabdomyosarcoma cells (established at the
Children’s Hospital Tuebingen from a multifocal,
alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma of an eight year old girl)
UW228-3 medulloblastoma cells (kindly provided by S
Pfister, DKFZ Heidelberg) CaCo2 (ATCC, USA.) colon
carcinoma cells, 451Lu melanoma (kindly provided by T.
Sinnberg, Dermatology Tübingen), HF normal dermal skin
fibroblasts (Promocell) and MCF-7 breast carcinoma cells
(from ATCC, USA). All cells were seeded at 3x105 cells/
ml and grown for 48 h before RNA isolation in DMEM
high glucose medium (Gibco) containing 10% FBS and
1% penicillin/streptomycin.

Silencing of chorein
ZF rhabdomyosarcoma cells and CaCo2 cells
were grown in DMEM high glucose medium (Gibco)
containing 10% fetal bovine serum and supplemented
with 1% penicillin/streptomycin under standard culture

concentration was determined using the Bradford assay
(BioRad, München, Germany). Thirty µg of protein
were solubilized in sample buffer at 95ºC for 5 min.
The samples for chorein detection were separated by
NuPAGE® Novex® 3–8% Tris-Acetate gels (Life
Technologies, Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA) in a
Tricine-Tris buffer. For the remaining proteins a 10% SDSPAGE in a Glycine-Tris buffer was used. After separation
proteins were electro-transferred onto PVDF membranes
for 90 min and blocked with 5% non-fat milk or 5% BSA
in TBS-0.10% Tween 20 at room temperature for 1 h.
Then, the membranes were incubated with appropriate
primary antibodies: anti-PI-3K p85 antibody (1:1000,
Cell Signaling), anti-phospho-PI-3K p85 (Tyr458)/ p55
(Tyr199) antibody (1:1000, Cell Signaling), anti BCL-2
antibody (1:1000, Cell Signaling), anti-VPS13A-antibody
(1:1000,Sigma-Aldrich, Germany) and anti-GAPDH
antibody (1:2000, Cell Signaling) at 4°C overnight. After
washing (TBST), the blots were incubated with secondary
anti-rabbit (1:2000, Cell Signaling) antibody for 1 h at
room temperature. Antibody binding was detected after
additional washes (TBST) with the ECL detection reagent
(Amersham, Freiburg, Germany) and quantified with
Quantity One Software (BioRad, München, Germany).
To assign the right protein size we used Protein-Marker V
(Peqlab, Erlangen, Germany) and HiMark™ Pre-stained
Protein Standard (Life Technologies, USA).

conditions (37°C, 5% CO2). Cells (1 x 105) were seeded
in 6 well plates 24 h before transfection. The cells were
subsequently transfected with validated siRNA for
VPS13A (chorein) (ID# s23342, Ambion, Darmstadt,
Germany) or with a negative control siRNA (ID#4390843,
Ambion) using siPORT amine transfection agent
(Ambion) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. The
efficiency of silencing was checked by RT-PCR (Figs. 1B,
Suppl. Fig. 1A, and Suppl Fig. 2A).

Cytostatic treatment
Not silenced and chorein silenced (48 h) ZF cells
were treated with 500 nM Doxorubicin (Sigma-Aldrich,
Germany) for 24 h under standard culture conditions
(37°C, 5% CO2).

RT-PCR
To determine transcript levels, total RNA was
isolated 24 h, 48 h and 72 h after transfection using the
Trifast Reagent (Peqlab, Erlangen, Germany). Two µg
RNA was reverse-transcribed using oligo(dT)12-18 primers
and GoScript Reverse Transcriptase Kit (Promega)
according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Quantitative
real-time PCR was performed with the BioRad iCycler
iQTM Real-Time PCR Detection System (Bio-Rad
Laboratories) using GoTaq Sybr Green Master Mix
(Promega). The reaction was applied in a final volume of
20 µl containing 2 µl of cDNA under following conditions:
an initial incubation at 95°C for 5 min, 40 cycles at 95°C
for 15 s, 59°C for 20 s and 72°C for 30 s. Specificity of the
PCR products was verified by melting curve analysis. The
subsequent primers were used (5’→3’ orientation):
VPS13A fw: AGTGGGACGACGTCTGTACAC
VPS13A rev:AGTTCTCATCTTCTGGCTTCAG
BCL-2 fw: TGGATGACTGAGTACCTGAACCG
BCL-2 rev: TGAGCAGAGTCTTCAGAGACAGC
BAX fw: ACTGGACAGTAACATGGAGCTG
BAX rev: AGCCCATGATGGTTCTGATCAG
GAPDH fw: TGAGTACGTCGTGGAGTCCACTG
GAPDH rev: GGTGCTAAGCAGTTGGTGGTG
The mRNA expression levels of the respective genes
were normalized to the expression levels of GAPDH in
the same cDNA sample. Relative quantification of gene
expression was calculated according to the ΔΔCt method.

FACS analysis
To determine the apoptotic response we used
the Annexin V Apoptosis Detection Kit (MabTag,
Germany). After silencing cells were harvested from the
6 well plates by treatment with trypsin-EDTA (SigmaAldrich, Germany) for 10 min and washed once with
cell culture medium. After a further wash with PBS and
centrifugation at 1600 RPM for 3 min at RT cells were
suspended in 100 µl binding buffer containing Annexin
V -FITC and propidium iodide and incubated for 20
min in the dark at RT. In the following the cells were
washed once, resuspended in 200 µl binding buffer and
measured immediately using the BD FACS Calibur (BD
Biosciences, USA). For Doxorubicin treated cells TOPRO®-3 Iodide (1:1000, Life Technologies, USA) was
used instead of propidium iodide.
Active caspase-3 was estimated utilizing CaspGlow
Fluorescein Active Caspase-3 Staining Kit (BioVision,
USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. After
detaching and one wash with cell culture medium cells
were suspended in 300 µl of complete DMEM (Gibco,
USA) including 1 µl of FITC conjugated inhibitor
of active Caspase-3 (FITC-DEVD-FMK). After 1h
incubation and two washes with supplied wash buffer,
cells were resuspended in 300 µl of wash buffer and
analyzed by flow cytometry (BD FACS Calibur, BD
Biosciences, USA).

Western blotting
To quantify protein abundance, cells were washed
twice with ice cold PBS and suspended in 200 μl icecold RIPA lysis buffer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA)
containing Halt Protease and Halt Phosphatase Inhibitor
Cocktail (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA). The protein

was measured by incubating 105 cells in 10 ng/ml JC9
(Life Technologies, USA) in the dark for 10 min at 37o
C. The cells were washed once in PBS at 1600 g for 3
min. A potential-dependent shift of fluorescence emission
from 525 nm (FL1) to 590 nm (FL2) in the mitochondria
was measured immediately by flow cytometry (BD FACS

FITC-dextran uptake was measured after 2 hours
incubation with FITC-conjugated dextran (500 µg/ml,
Sigma-Aldrich, Germany) in serum free DMEM medium
at 37°C and on ice (background). The intake was stopped
by adding ice-cold PBS to the cells. After three washes
with ice-cold PBS, cells were re-suspended in 200 µl of
PBS and analyzed by flow cytometry (BD FACS Calibur,
BD Biosciences, USA). For the calculation, mean
fluorescence values of the samples incubated on ice were
subtracted from corresponding values incubated at 37°C.
