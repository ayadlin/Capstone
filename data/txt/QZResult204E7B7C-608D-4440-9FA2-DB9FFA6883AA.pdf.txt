BACKGROUND: Approximately 50% of all patients with primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL) are aged
65 years; however, this group is relatively understudied, and to the authors’s knowledge, optimal treatment for older
patients is not well defined. METHODS: This was a retrospective review of PCNSL patients aged 65 years who were
treated at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center between 1986 and 2008. A multivariate analysis of demographic
and clinical variables on prognosis and receipt of treatment was performed. RESULTS: One hundred seventy-four
patients between the ages of 65 and 89 years were identified; there was a slight predominance of women (52.9%).
One hundred forty-eight patients were treated with chemotherapy at the time of diagnosis (98% with methotrexatebased therapy) and 31 of these patients also received whole-brain radiotherapy (WBRT). Sixteen patients received
WBRT alone. A radiographic response to chemotherapy was noted in 76% of patients. Ninety patients developed disease progression after initial treatment; 74 received salvage therapy and 48% of these patients responded to salvage
treatment. The median overall survival was 25 months (range, 18-33 months), and the 3-year survival rate was 36%.
Approximately 20.1% of patients were alive for 11 years. WBRT was delivered more frequently before 1998, and
patients with a history of prior malignancy were less likely to receive WBRT. Age and performance status were identified as the most important predictors of survival. Treatment-related neurotoxicity at 2 years was strongly associated
with receipt of WBRT (P ¼ .0002). CONCLUSIONS: PCNSL in the elderly remains sensitive to methotrexate-based
chemotherapy and aggressive treatment may be warranted both at the time of diagnosis and disease recurrence.

Primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL) is a rare form of extranodal non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL)

confined to the brain, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), spinal cord, leptomeninges, or eyes. PCNSL accounts for <5% of NHLs
and approximately 3% of all primary brain tumors.1 Although rare, the age-adjusted incidence in the United States has
increased substantially over the past several decades.2 Much of this increase was attributed initially to younger patients
with human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immune deficiency syndrome; however, the incidence in this specific population has been decreasing due to the development of active antiretroviral drugs.3 Despite this, the incidence remains
high among immunocompetent older patients.4 Moreover, patients aged >60 years account for approximately half of all
those diagnosed with PCNSL, making the elderly a priority in the development of improved therapeutic strategies.
In untreated patients the prognosis is poor, with a median survival of 3 to 4 months.5 Whole-brain radiotherapy
(WBRT) alone usually results in a median survival of approximately 12 months, and in patients aged >60 years, the median is only 7.6 months.6 Multiple prospective studies using chemotherapy in combination with WBRT have shown
improved median survivals of 30 to 60 months.7-15 However, prolonged survival was accompanied by a high rate of

neurotoxicity, particularly in the elderly.16 Recent trials
have suggested that older patients treated with methotrexate-based chemotherapy and deferred WBRT can achieve
high response rates and comparable survival without neurotoxicity, but a shorter progression-free survival.8,14,17,18
Despite these advances, prognosis remains worse in
the elderly than in younger patients, even when the same
treatment regimen is used in both populations. Age and
performance status have been identified as the 2 most important prognostic factors, with age 50 years conveying a
worse prognosis.19 Age is the strongest prognostic factor,
and in some series exerts a stronger effect on survival than
treatment regimen.20 In addition, therapeutic advances
have not been translated into widespread community practice, particularly among older patients. In a prior study
using data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End
Results (SEER) cancer registry linked with Medicare
claims, we found that only 80% of patients aged 65 years
with newly diagnosed PCNSL received any treatment.21
Only 43% of treated patients received any chemotherapy,
whereas 36% received WBRT alone. Furthermore, advancing age was associated with less therapy and increasing use
of WBRT alone, a suboptimal therapeutic approach.18
Balancing treatment efficacy with toxicity is particularly challenging in elderly patients with PCNSL. In this
study, we attempt to characterize the prognostic factors of
treatment and outcome of a large cohort of older patients
treated at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center
(MSKCC).

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study Design
The MSKCC institutional database was used to identify
patients with PCNSL diagnosed between January 1,
1986, and December 31, 2008. Inclusion criteria
included histologically confirmed PCNSL and age 65
years at the time of diagnosis. The date of the surgical procedure leading to a definitive pathologic diagnosis was
used as the date of diagnosis. Data were collected by chart
review. We examined the impact of demographic variables on the probability of receiving chemotherapy,
WBRT, or both. Response to treatment was defined as
complete disappearance of all contrast-enhancing lesions
on magnetic resonance imaging or computed tomography
when the patient was no longer receiving glucocorticoids
(complete response [CR]) or a 50% decrease in enhancing disease on stable or decreasing doses of glucocorticoids
(partial response [PR]). This retrospective study was
approved by the MSKCC Institutional Review Board.

Statistical Analyses
Demographic and clinical variables studied included
patient sex, age, Karnofsky performance score (KPS), year
of diagnosis, marital status, CSF total protein, deep brain
involvement, serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level,
hemiparesis, and history of prior cancer. Age at diagnosis
was analyzed as a categorical variable. Age trends were
assessed using an ordinal age at diagnosis variable. The
following variables were dichotomized in the analysis:
CSF total protein, KPS, serum LDH, and year of diagnosis. The year 1998 was used as the cutpoint for year of diagnosis because we had eliminated the routine use of
WBRT in the initial treatment of older patients by that
time. Therapy included any chemotherapy treatment, any
radiation treatment, and a combined variable of having
been treated with both chemotherapy and RT. Unadjusted logistic regression models were used to analyze demographic and clinical predictors of receipt of treatment.
Multivariate logistic regression models were used to analyze those demographic and clinical predictors of receipt
of treatment that were univariately significant at the a
<.10 level. The association between clinically defined
neurotoxicity and WBRT was examined in a landmark
analysis at 2 years from diagnosis. Neurotoxicity events
occurring after 2 years, as well as patients who were not
alive and followed for 2 years, were not included in the
analysis. The selection of 2 years was based on the median
overall survival of the cohort. A landmark analysis was
performed to ensure that those included in the analysis
had sufficient follow-up to develop neurotoxicity without
death as a competing event.
Overall survival was examined from the date of diagnosis to date of death or last follow-up. Univariate Cox
proportional hazards models were fit to analyze predictors
of survival. A multivariate Cox proportional hazard model
was used to analyze predictors of survival that were univariately significant at the a <.10 level. All statistical analyses were performed using SAS statistical software
(version 9.1; SAS Institute Inc, Cary, NC).

RESULTS
Patient Characteristics
One hundred seventy-four patients aged 65 years who
were diagnosed with PCNSL between 1986 and 2008
were included (Table 1). The median age at diagnosis was
72 years (range, 65-89 years); there was a predominance
of women (52.9%). Most patients were diagnosed before
1998 (62.6%), and a majority of patients were married

Predictors of Treatment
Significant univariate predictors of receipt of chemotherapy were age at diagnosis, year of diagnosis, and deep
brain involvement. Patients who were diagnosed in 1998
and later were more likely to receive chemotherapy (odds
ratio [OR], 3.4; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 1.38.7) as were patients with deep brain involvement (OR,
4.6; 95% CI, 1.2-17.3). There was also a trend noted with
age in which older patients were more likely to receive
chemotherapy (P ¼ .07). In the multivariate analysis for
predictors of chemotherapy treatment, only deep brain
involvement was found to be significant (OR, 4.5; 95%
CI, 1.1-17.7), adjusting for age at diagnosis and year of
diagnosis.
Significant univariate predictors of receipt of RT
included age at diagnosis, year of diagnosis, marital status,
deep brain involvement, and history of prior cancer.
Patients were significantly less likely to receive RT if they
were older, diagnosed in 1998 or later, unmarried, had
deep brain involvement, or had at least 1 prior cancer. In
the multivariate setting, those patients who were diagnosed in 1998 or later were less likely to receive RT (hazard ratio [HR], 0.2; 95% CI, 0.1-0.5) as were those with
at least 1 prior cancer (HR, 0.2; 95% CI, 0.1-0.9). Marital
status remained of borderline significance (P ¼ .06) as did
a trend for age (P ¼ .06). Other results for the analyses of
predictors of PCNSL treatment can be seen in Table 3.
Survival Analysis
The median overall survival for the entire cohort was 25
months (95% CI, 18-33 months) (Fig. 1). The 3-year survival rate was 36% (95% CI, 29%-44%). Ninety patients
(52%) developed disease progression with a median time
to disease progression of 24 months (95% CI, 15-30
months); 74 of these 90 patients (82.2%) received salvage
therapy, 53 received chemotherapy alone, 14 received

Toxicity
Acute treatment-related toxicity was not collected prospectively in all patients. However, NCI CTCAEv 3.0
grades 3 and 4 nephrotoxicity related to high-dose methotrexate was noted in 13 of the 145 patients treated (9%);
this is a minimal incidence. There was no grade 5
nephrotoxicity.
There were 77 patients alive 2 years from diagnosis.
Eighteen (23%) developed neurotoxicity, 67% of whom
received RT. This is in contrast to 55 patients who survived 2 years and never developed neurotoxicity, 18% of
whom received RT (P ¼ .0002). There were 4 patients
alive at 2 years who developed neurotoxicity after that
timepoint and whose neurotoxicity events were excluded.

RT, and 7 received both. Radiographic response (CR þ
PR) was noted in 48% of patients receiving salvage treatment. Thirty-nine patients were alive at a median followup of 34 months, and their treatment was comparable to
the group as a whole. Thirty-five (89.7%) of these patients
were diagnosed before 1998 and represent long-term survivors; these 35 patients were 20.1% of the entire cohort.
Age at diagnosis and KPS were found to be the only 2 significant predictors of overall survival in the univariate
analysis (Table 4). In the multivariate model, increasing
age demonstrated a significant trend (P ¼ .03) toward a
greater probability of death. Patients with a KPS 70
were significantly less likely to die (P <.0001).

DISCUSSION
The results of the current study demonstrate that vigorous
therapy of elderly patients with PCNSL can produce prolonged survival in a significant percentage. The data from
the current study represent a selected patient population
that may not reflect the elderly population in the community; however, nearly 10% of our patients were aged 80
years and nearly 40% had a KPS of 60 at the time of diagnosis. Despite these clinical features, 96.5% of our patients
received therapy, which is a much higher percentage than
noted in the SEER-Medicare cohort or the general British
Columbia population, most likely reflecting our vigorous
approach to these patients.21,22 Furthermore, 83% (145 of
174 patients) were treated with high-dose methotrexate. In
general, treatment was well tolerated and the majority
responded. Even at the time of disease recurrence, 48% of
patients responded to salvage therapy. These data demonstrate that many elderly patients can, and should, receive a
treatment regimen comparable to that which is often reserved for younger patients.
Age is the most influential prognostic factor in
PCNSL and invariably affects treatment decisions.19,21,23
The SEER-Medicare data indicated that 20% of all older
patients are not treated at all.21 In a large populationbased study in British Columbia, 10.7% of all PCNSL
patients seen in that province between 1990 and 2003
received steroids only and no definitive treatment; the majority were older patients.22 Furthermore, when treatment
was administered, it was often suboptimal. WBRT was
the sole therapy for 36% of patients in the SEER-Medicare database, 17% received chemotherapy alone, and
26% received both.21 The median survival of the SEERMedicare cohort was 7 months, comparable to the 7.6

months achieved with WBRT alone in patients aged 60
years.6,21 Outcome is superior when chemotherapy is part
of the initial treatment plan. In a comparably aged population, high-dose methotrexate-based chemotherapy with
or without WBRT achieved a median overall survival of
29 months in those patients aged >60 years, which is similar to the 25-month median survival noted in our
cohort.18
The majority of patients in our elderly cohort
received chemotherapy alone as initial treatment. Approximately 83% of our total population and 98% of those
who received any chemotherapy received methotrexate (at
a dose of 3.5 g/m2). This reflects the aggressive approach
of a tertiary referral center accustomed to using high doses
of chemotherapy for this disease despite the poor performance status of many patients. For many older patients, it
has been well demonstrated that methotrexate-based regimens are tolerable and effective.24-27 One study demonstrated no significant difference between methotrexate (at
a dose of 4 g/m2)-related toxicities in patients aged 60
years versus those aged <60 years.26 Similarly, a recent
retrospective review of patients aged 70 years who were

4610

treated with high-dose methotrexate (at a dose of 8 g/m2)
demonstrated that this regimen was well tolerated and
produced radiographic response rates of >90%, and that
few patients required discontinuation of chemotherapy
for toxicity.27 Although numerous studies have demonstrated the efficacy of methotrexate-based regimens, to the
best of our knowledge no phase 3 trial has been conducted
to date to demonstrate the superiority of any particular
regimen. However, methotrexate appears to be well tolerated in the elderly, supporting its use in these patients.
The late complications of combined modality therapy, namely neurotoxicity and dementia, were first recognized in the late 1990s. The results of the current study
demonstrated significantly less use of WBRT in patients
treated in 1998 or later. Despite this trend, the year of
treatment appeared to have no effect on survival, suggesting that chemotherapy alone may be a good choice for the
initial treatment of PCNSL in the elderly. Radiographic
responses, time to disease progression, and overall survival
were found to be similar to the results of prior studies
using methotrexate-based regimens.12,17,18,24,25,27 Recent
data suggest that consolidation with low doses of RT after

immunochemotherapy may improve upon survival without the risk of neurotoxicity.28,29 However, longer followup and additional studies are needed.
Other than year of diagnosis, few sociodemographic
characteristics were found to predict treatment. Married
patients were more likely to receive both chemotherapy
and RT, which was also found in the SEER-Medicare
dataset, perhaps suggesting that patients with strong social
support are more likely to receive aggressive therapy. Our
sample size was relatively small and may not have been
powered to detect small but significant associations
between other patient characteristics and treatment

The current study has several limitations, including
the inherent biases of a retrospective study. Other important variables including treatment toxicity, quality of life
measures, and detailed neurocognitive assessments on all
patients were not available. Referral and treatment practice biases are almost certainly inherent in this single-center cohort. Nonetheless, this study reflects a relatively
large group of older patients with a rare disease, specifically examining patterns of care, prognostic factors, and
outcomes of specialized treatment practices as they apply
to the elderly PCNSL population.
Although outcome is worse in older patients with
PCNSL, that should not preclude the use of aggressive
therapy because the majority of patients respond and
improve clinically. The patients in the current study
cohort had a favorable time to disease progression, and
greater than half responded to salvage therapy. Clinical
trials aimed at this population are crucial to improving
outcomes associated with this disease, and patients should
be referred to institutions with an interest in PCNSL for
inclusion into these studies.
