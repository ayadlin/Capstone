ABSTRACT
Chemotherapy is the main treatment for patients with breast cancer metastases,
but natural alternatives have been receiving attention for their potential as novel antitumor reagents. Amplexicaule A (APA) is a flavonoid glucoside isolated from rhizomes
of Polygonum amplexicaule D. Don var. sinense Forb (PADF). We found that APA has
anti-tumor effects in a breast cancer xenograft mouse model and induces apoptosis
in breast cancer cell lines. APA increased levels of cleaved caspase-3,-8,-9 and PARP,
which resulted from suppression of MCL-1 and BCL-2 expression in the cells. APA also
inactivated the Akt/mTOR pathway in breast cancer cells. Thus, APA exerts a strong
anti-tumor effect on breast cancer cells, most likely through induction of apoptosis.
Our study is the first to identify this novel anti-tumor compound and provides a new
strategy for isolation and separation of single compounds from herbs.

INTRODUCTION

antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and anti-cancer properties
[9–12] in several human cancers [13, 14]. The tumor
suppressive effects of flavonoids are mediated through
the induction of apoptosis and cell cycle arrest that results
from interference with key intracellular signaling pathways
[15, 16]. The rhizomes of Polygonum amplexicaule D. Don
var. sinense Forb (PADF) are considered to be a restorative
food in some areas of China. Earlier studies demonstrated
that PADF has anti-tumor activity [6], and we previously
found that the primary anti-tumor components of PADF
were the total flavonoids [7]; however, it is unclear if and
how PADF effects breast cancer.
Here we used a new protocol to isolate the polar
compounds amplexicaule A (APA) and B (APB) from
the n-butanol fraction of PADF. APA and APB are
flavonoid glucosides first isolated from Comastoma
pedunculatum and Clausena lansium, respectively [17, 18],
but up to now there have been no reports on their
biological activities. In this study, we show that APA
induces apoptosis, which likely contributes to the anticancer actions of PADF. The apoptosis-inducing activity of
APA is associated with the downregulation of MCL-1 and
BCL-2 proteins and activation of caspases-3, -8 and -9.

Breast cancer is the most commonly occurring
malignancy and the second leading cause of cancer-related
death among women world-wide [1]. In the U.S., there are
about 230,000 new cases each year in women and about
2,300 new cases in men [1, 2]. In China, approximately
30 in every 100,000 women will develop breast cancer
in their lifetime, and this proportion is rising as the
disease becomes more common in younger patients [3, 4].
Surgery is the first choice for breast cancer therapy;
however, chemotherapy is still used as the main treatment
for women whose cancer has spread outside the breast and
axilla. All chemotherapy protocols currently in use have
side effects. Therefore, new drugs with fewer side effects
could have major impacts on breast cancer therapy.
Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) has become an
important source of diverse therapeutic agents [5]. Natural
products can serve as the origins of novel antitumor and
immune stimulating reagents [6, 7]. TCM therapies are
often multiple components, multiple targets and multiple
activities, like the combination chemotherapies used in
cancer treatment [6–8]. For example, flavonoids exhibit

We also found that APA suppresses the phosphorylation
of Akt, thereby inactivating the Akt/mTOR pathway and
relaying apoptosis signaling. Our data demonstrate that
APA extracted from PADF has anti-tumor effects on breast
cancer via induction of apoptosis. Our findings suggest that
APA may be a novel, natural treatment for breast cancer.

In addition to body weight (Supplementary Tables 1–4)
we also examined serum indicators of hepatic and renal
functions (Supplementary Figure 5 and 6), and blood
counts in these mice (Supplementary Table 7), and
found no differences between APA treatment groups and
controls.

RESULTS

APA inhibits proliferation of human breast
cancer cells

The molecular structure of the two compounds

To understand the mechanism underlying APA’s
anti-tumor actions, we examined the effects of APA on
cell proliferation. Human breast cancer cell lines MCF-7
and MDA-MB-435 and human fibroblasts were treated
with various concentrations of APA. After treatment, cell
viability was examined using a MTT assay. Treatment
with APA inhibited tumor cell viability in a dosedependent manner while having very little effect on the
proliferation of fibroblast cells (Figure 3A). These results
suggest that APA specifically inhibits the proliferation of
tumor cells but not normal cells. To further demonstrate
the antiproliferative activity of APA, we carried out a
clonogenic assay. APA inhibited the clonogenicity of MCF-7
and MDA-MB-435 cells in a dose-dependent manner
(Figure 3B). About 70% inhibition of colony formation was
observed at 40 μM of APA (Figure 3C and 3D).

PADF (Figure 1A) is a plant growing in the area of
Enshi, Hubei province, China. The root part (Figure 1B) of
the plant was prepared for isolation of total flavonoids. The
detail protocol for isolation and separation is described in
the methods. Two peaks showed in the Fraction Fe of the
total flavonoids from PADF on High Performance Liquid
Chromatography (HPLC) flow (Figure 1C). The two
compounds (compound-1 and compound-2) were further
isolated through semi-prepared HPLC separation. They were
confirmed as two distinctive compounds by spectroscopic
methods, including: infrared (IR), ultraviolet (UV), mass
spectroscopy (MS), proton nuclear magnetic resonance
(1H-NMR), carbon-13 nuclear magnetic resonance
(13C-NMR) and heteronuclear multiple-bond correlation
spectroscopy (HMBC). The two compounds were named
Amplexicaule A (APA) and Amplexicaule B (APB),
respectively. Their molecular structures are identified as
3-o-[α-L-rhamnopyranosyl-(1-6)- β-D-Galactopyranose]5,7,3′,4′-tetrahydroxy flavonoid (Figure 1D) [19] and
6-C-glucose-5,7,3′,4′-tetrahydroxy flavonoid (Figure 1E)
[20] with molecular formulas of C27H30O16 and C21H20O11,
respectively.

Apoptogenic effects of APA on human breast
cancer cells
To determine whether the antiproliferative effects of
APA is associated with the induction of apoptosis, tumor
cells treated with APA were sorted via flow cytometry
following Annexin V/7-AAD staining (a marker of
apoptosis). Figure 4A shows the representative flow
images in MLF-7 cells. APA increased the percentage
of apoptotic cells in both MCF-7 and MDA-MB-435
lines in a dose-dependent manner as compared with
vehicle treatment (Figure 4B). As caspases are important
regulators of apoptosis [21], to further confirm APAinduced apoptosis, we assessed the effects of APA on
caspase activation. Treatment of tumor cells with APA
resulted in an elevation of the cleaved form of PARP, as
well as caspases-3, -8, and -9 in a dose-dependent manner
(Figure 4C), indicating that APA may induce apoptosis
through activation of these molecules.

The in vivo anti-tumor effects of APA in a breast
cancer xenograft mouse model
In order to explore the anti-tumor effects of APA
and APB, we first tested their effects in vivo with MCF-7
or MDA-MB-435 xenograft mouse models. As shown in
Figure 2A and Supplementary Tables 1 and 2, APA had an
inhibitory effect on tumor mass in both the MCF-7 and
MDA-MB-435 xenograft models (p < 0.01), compared
to saline treatment. In contrast, APB had no tumorsuppressive activities in vivo. We further tested APA at
various doses using Capecitabine Tablets, a conventional
anti-breast cancer drug, as a positive control. Tumor
masses in the 50 and 150 mg/kg groups of APA treatment
were less than that of non-treatment groups (p < 0.05 or
P < 0.01) without obvious body weight changes in the
mice (Figure 2B, 2C and Supplementary Tables 3 and 4),
indicating that APA suppresses tumor growth in a dosedependent manner. Although the Capecitabine Tablets had
a higher tumor inhibitory rate, the average body weight of
the Capecitabine treated mice was also decreased (p < 0.05)
compared to saline treatment (Supplementary Table 3).

APA decreases MCL-1 and BCL-2
To further understand how APA induces apoptosis,
we measured the expression of the BCL-2 family proteins,
a group of proteins that regulate the anti- and pro-apoptotic
processes [22]. APA treatment down-regulated MCL-1 and
BCL-2 proteins in both MCF-7 and MDA-MB-435 cells
(Figure 5A). In addition, there was a slight increase in
Bax expression following APA treatment (Figure 5A). As

MCL-1 was down-regulated in the cells treated with APA,
we next sought to demonstrate the functional significance
of MCL-1 in APA-induced apoptosis. We transfected
MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells with a MCL-1 expression
vector and then tested the effects of APA on tumor cell
viability and apoptosis. Cells transfected with an empty
vector were used as controls. Expression of MCL-1
blocked APA-induced cytotoxic effects on MCF-7 and
MDA-MB-435 cells and blocked apoptosis, as evidenced
by the near absence of cleaved PARP in MCL-1 overexpressing cells (Figure 6B). These results suggest that
downregulation of MCL-1 is necessary for APA-induced
apoptosis in breast tumor cells.

phospho-mTOR, and phospho-P70 S6 kinase, but did not
alter total Akt protein (Figure 7A). Our results indicate that
APA suppresses the activation of Akt/mTOR pathways.

APA induces cytotoxicity in primary breast
tumor cells
Finally, we assessed the effects of APA on
cytotoxicity of primary tumor cells from breast cancer
patients. After 2 days of APA treatment the number of
viable cells was reduced in a dose-dependent manner
(Figure 8A). APA treatment at a dose of 100 ng/mL also
reduced p-AKT, MCL-1, and BCL-2 expression in these
cells (Figure 8B). These data demonstrate a cytotoxic
effect of APA on primary breast cancer cells acting
through the same mechanism as in breast cell lines.

APA inactivates the Akt/mTOR signaling
pathway

DISCUSSION

Flavonoid and its metabolites act upon the Akt/
mTOR pathway. In order to understand the upstream signals
responsible for APA-induced apoptosis, we examined the
effect of this compound on Akt/mTOR signaling. We found
that treatment with APA decreased levels of phospho-Akt,

Flavonoids are the main components responsible
for anti-tumor activity in plant extracts. The method we
used to extract total flavonoids is well established, as was

described by Wallace and Burong [23, 24]. We previously
isolated total flavonoids from PADF using basic water
extraction followed by acidic precipitation, and reported
that the extracts had anti-tumor effects [7]. We have now
used a new strategy to further isolate single compounds
from PADF, structurally identified the isolated compounds
and screened them for their anti-tumor activities. Using
this approach we found that a single compound is
responsible for the anti-tumor effects of PADF.
In the isolation process, we first extracted the
PADF with 95% ethanol, after which the total extract
was further separated based on the polarity of the
compounds into petroleum ether, ethylacetate, n-butanol
and aqueous fractions. We tested the anti-tumor effects
of the extracted fractions and found that the n-butanol
fraction had strong anti-tumor effects against breast

cancer cells. The n-butanol fraction was then further
separated using semi-prepared HPLC, and two single
compounds (APA and APB) were obtained. We identified
their molecular structures, and found that both are polar
flavonoid glycosides. We further found that APA but not
APB exerts anti-tumor effects by inducing apoptosis,
which may be due to APA has stronger polarity. We
also examined the molecular mechanisms underlying
APA-induced the apoptosis and found that APA induces
apoptosis by inactivating Akt, suppressing MCL-1 and
BCL-2 expression, and activating capases-3, -8, and -9
(for a model, See Supplementary Figure 1). Our study not
only identifies the single compound in PADF responsible
for anti-tumor effects, but also provides a new strategy and
protocol for isolation of single compounds with anti-tumor
activities from herbs.

Plant-derived chemicals are drawing increasing
attention as sources of therapeutic reagents, in part due to
their lower toxicity toward the host [7, 25]. In our study,
the weights of transplanted tumors collected from the
APA-treated group were smaller than those from the saline
control group. APA treatment suppressed breast cancer cell
proliferation and induced apoptosis in a dose-dependent
manner. These data clearly demonstrate the in vivo tumor
suppressing activity and in vitro apoptosis-inducing
activity of APA against breast cancer cells. Importantly,
APA had no effect on normal fibroblasts in vitro, nor was
there an effect on body weight in the xenograft mouse
model. In addition, the parameters of routine blood
examination and indicators of hepatic and renal function
were all within the normal range after APA treatment in the
mouse model. Taken together, these observations suggest
that APA, at the dosages used in our study, exhibited few
side effects on host animals. This finding is also consistent
with our earlier report on the effects of total PADF extract,
which was shown to be nontoxic [7].
Many anti-tumor chemicals exert their antiproliferative
effects by inducing apoptosis [26, 27]. In this study, we also
observed that APA inhibited tumor cell proliferation by
inducing apoptosis. Apoptosis results from the activation of
cascade of caspases, a family of proteases comprising the
central component of the proteolytic system in the apoptotic
process [21]. We found that APA induced cleavage of
caspases-3, -8 and -9 and also resulted in PARP cleavage,
another apoptosis-related event, possibly catalyzed by
caspase-3. These results indicate that APA exerts its antitumor effects by inducing apoptosis in breast cancer cells.
The mitochondrial apoptosis pathway is an important
means of inducing cell death, and flavonoids have been
reported to activate mitochondrial apoptotic signaling
[14, 28, 29]. As critical inhibitors of the mitochondrial
apoptotic pathway [30], BCL-2 family proteins bind to
the outer membrane of mitochondria and prevent release
of cytochrome c [31]. APA treatment reduced BCL-2
levels in MCF-7 and MDA-MB-435 cells, suggesting
downregulation of BCL-2 family proteins contribute
to the promotion of apoptosis by APA. Notably, APA
treatment also led to downregulation of MCL-1, a prosurvival member of the BCL-2 family [32]. These results
suggest that APA-induced downregulation of MCL-1
plays an essential role in the APA-induced tumor cell
apoptosis.
The Akt/mTOR pathway is important for the
regulation of cell proliferation, growth and apoptosis
[33, 34]. Flavonoid and its metabolites interact with
Akt/mTOR, affecting its function [35, 36]. Molecular
similarity analysis showed that APA strongly affects
Akt activation (data not shown). Moreover, our data
demonstrate that APA inhibits Akt/mTOR and P70 S6k
in breast cancer cells. Flavonoids-induced Akt/mTOR
inactivation is also reportedly responsible for suppression
of BCL-2 and MCL-1 [14, 37]. We hypothesize that
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

APA-induced inactivation of Akt/mTOR pathways is
responsible for the downregulation of BCL-2 and MCL-1
in the treated cells, which triggers apoptosis.
Finally, we observed that APA exerts antiproliferative
effects through inactivation of Akt and suppression of
BCL-2 and MCL-1 in primary cancer cells from breast
cancer patients. These data further support the notion that
APA could potentially be an effective therapeutic agent for
the treatment of breast cancer.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Extraction and purification of amplexicaule A, B
Rhizomes of Polygonum amplexicaule D. Don
var. sinense Forb (PADF) were collected in Enshi, Hubei
Province, PR China and identiﬁed by Dr. Dingrong
Wan’s laboratory, College of Pharmacy, South-Central
University for Nationalities, China. Voucher samples
(No. SC-2012187) were deposited at the Herbarium of
Medical Plants located in the College of Pharmacy, SouthCentral University for Nationalities. The dried root tubers
of PADF (10 kg dry weight for each lot) were extracted
with 95% alcohol three times at room temperature. The
combined solution was filtered and concentrated under
reduced pressure to produce 95% ethanol extract. The EtOH
extract was suspended with a solution of water:MeOH
(1:9) and successively extracted with petroleum
ether, ethylacetete, and n-butanol. The yield of 95%
ethanol extract and extractive fractions were weighed and
dried to constant weight, and kept in a desiccator. The
respective yields were: ethanol extract fraction 1.185 kg,
petroleum ether fraction 35.3 g, ethyl acetate fraction 490.0 g,
n-butanol fraction 402 g, and residuary water fraction
258.0 g. The n-butanol fraction was repeatedly separated
by normal phase silica gel column and eluted with a
Chloroform: Methanol step gradient (1:9, 2:8, 3:7……9:1)
to obtain 7 fractions (Fr A to Fr G). Fraction D was separated
by Reverse-silica gel (YMC Co. Japan) column and eluted
with methanol-water in the same step gradient to generate
7 fractions (Fr Fa to Fg). Fe (120 mg) was separated by
semi-preparative HPLC. For HPLC, the mobile phase was
acetonitrile:water (28:72) mixture and the semi-preparative
column was Super Co. Inc. Waters S Spheripor ODS
(particle size 5 μm, diameter 10 mm, length 250 mm). Flow
rate was set at 1.5 ml/min, and injected 100 μL at a time; the
detection was performed at 254 nm. The temperature of the
column oven was set at 35°C (Figure 1). Two compounds
(compound-1 15 mg and compound-2 10 mg) were obtained
and named. They were identified by spectrum methods
(including IR, UV, MS, 1H-NMR, 13C-NMR and HMBC).

Patients’ samples
Ten breast cancer tissue specimens were obtained
from patients with breast cancer stage IV at Renmin
18527

Hospital of Wuhan University, PR, China. Informed consent
was obtained from the patients and the study was approved
by the ethics committee of Renmin hospital of Wuhan
University, PR, China and ethics committee of SouthCentral University for Nationalities, Wuhan, PR China.

To establish a transplanted tumor model, 1 × 107 of MCF-7
cells (Viable cells > 95%) were injected subcutaneously
into the back of the nude mice using a 22-gauge needle.
Strict aseptic technique was followed. The mean volume
of the implanted tumors at the time of inoculation was
about 5 mm3, without differences among groups. The
mice were randomly divided into several groups as
described in the text, with 10 mice per group. Drug
administration began 3 days later. The positive control
group received Capecitabine Tablets (CBT) at a dosage
of 10 mg/kg. The vehicle control group received 0.9%
normal saline with DMSO. The drugs were administered
by intraperitoneal injection for 10 days at different
doses (mg/kg/day) as indicated in Figure 2A and 2C.
All mice were then euthanized and the segregated tumors
were weighed immediately.

Tumor cell preparation
Tumor cells were isolated from sterile tumor
specimens (surgical biopsy, malignant effusion, or
surgery tumor tissues) as previously reported [38, 39].
To be evaluable, each specimen had to achieve at least
90% pure tumor cell content morphologically [38, 39] and
90% viability by trypan blue exclusion. The resulting cells
were cultured in a reported media [38] and treated with
indicated dose of APA at a concentration of 2 × 105 cells/ml
for 2 days. Then cell viability was analyzed with
MTT and cell lysates were prepared for western bot as
described below.

Cell viability assay
The cytotoxic effect of APA on tumor cells was
determined using 3-(4, 5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,
5-diphenyltetrazoliumbromide (MTT) staining (28).
Briefly, 5 × 103 cells/well were plated in 96-well
plates with 100 μL of culture medium for 24 h and
then exposed to different concentrations of APA.
After 72 h, the culture medium was replaced with
100 μL of fresh medium including 0.5 mg/mL MTT.
Following 4 h of incubation 37°C, this medium was
removed, and 100 μL of DMSO was added to each
well to dissolve the purple formazan crystals. The
color reaction was quantified using an automatic
plate reader (Bio-Tek Instrument Inc, Winooski, VT)
at 570 nm. The half maximal inhibitory concentration
(IC50) (in μM), which represents the concentration of the
drug that lowers the cell number by 50%, was calculated
from the concentration-response curve. Each experiment
was repeated three times (n = 3), and the average
IC50 shown.

Reagents and antibodies
Amplexicaule A, B (purity = 99.5%) were dissolved
in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO; Sigma, St. Louis, MO)
at concentration of 250 mg/ml, and stored at –20°C.
Polyclonal antibodies against MCL-1, BCL-2, BAX,
cleaved-caspase-3, -8, -9, cleaved-PARP, phospho-Akt,
Akt, phospho-mTOR, phospho-P70 S6k and β-actin
were purchased from Cell Signaling (Beverly, MA).
Horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated anti-rabbit
immunoglobulin G (IgG) was purchased from Abcam
Biotechnology (USA). All cell culture media and other
reagents were purchased from Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA).
Western blot reagents were obtained from Pierce
Biotechnology.

Cells, animals and animal experimentation
MCF-7 and MDA-MB-435 cells were obtained
from ATCC and cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s
medium (Gibco, Grand Island, NY) supplemented with
10% fetal bovine serum (Gibco, Grand Island, NY),
100 U/mL penicillin, and 100 μg/mL streptomycin,
and maintained in a humidified atmosphere of 5%
CO2 at 37°C with 2 passages weekly. All cultures were
monitored routinely and found to be free of contamination
by mycoplasma or fungi. All lines were discarded after
3 months and new lines propagated from frozen stocks.
Female Kunming nude mice (18–22 g), aged
5–6 weeks, were purchased from the Experimental
Animal Center, Institute of Health and Epidemic
Prevention (Wuhan, China). Mice were housed in a
standard specific pathogen free (SPF) environment.
All the animal experimental procedures were approved
by the Animal Care and Use Committee of SouthCentral University for Nationalities (Wuhan, China).

Clonogenicity assay
This assay was carried out as previously reported
(28). Briefly, 1 × 103 cells/plate were plated in 3.5-mm
flat-bottom plates with 2 mL of culture medium for 24 h
and then exposed to different concentrations of APA.
After 7 days of incubation in a humidified atmosphere of
5% CO2 at 37°C, the supernatant was discarded and the
cells were washed with PBS before 1 mL crystal violet
solution [0.5% (w/v) in methanol] was added in each plate.
Plates were incubated under shaking for 10 min at room
temperature. After washing 3 times with tap water, the
plates were air dried at room temperature. Colonies were
photographed and counted using ImageJ imaging software
(NIH). Three independent experiments were performed,
and each experiment was carried out in triplicate.

Western blot analysis
Cells were lysed in the M-PER mammalian protein
extraction reagent (Thermo Scientific) supplemented with
a protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche, Indianapolis, IN) at
room temperature for 5 min, followed by centrifugation
at 14,000 × g for 10 min. Protein concentrations of cell
lysates were measured using the Bio-Rad DC assay
reagent (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). Proteins (10–20 μg)
were resolved by SDS-PAGE and then transferred to
polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membrane (BioRad, Hercules, CA). The PVDF membranes were
incubated with the respective antibodies in 3% BSA/
TBST at 4°C overnight, followed by incubation with
secondary antibody at room temperature for 1 h. Protein
signals were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence
method, according to the manufacturer’s protocol.
Statistical analysis
All presented data and results were confirmed by at
