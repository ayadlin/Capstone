SUMMARY

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Breast cancer initiating cells (BCICs), which can fully recapitulate the tumor origin and are often
resistant to chemo- and radiotherapy, are currently considered as a major obstacle for breast cancer
treatment. Here, we show that BIKDD, a constitutively active mutant form of proapoptotic gene,
BIK, effectively induces apoptosis of breast cancer cells and synergizes with lapatinib. Most
importantly, BikDD significantly reduced BCICs through co-antagonism of its binding partners
Bcl-2, Bcl-xL and Mcl-1, suggesting a potential therapeutic strategy targeting BCICs.
Furthermore, we developed a cancer-specific targeting approach for breast cancer that selectively
expresses BikDD in breast cancer cells including BCICs, and demonstrated its potent antitumor
activity and synergism with lapatinib in vitro and in vivo.

growth of new tumors, and are currently considered as a major obstacle for cancer therapies
(Gupta et al., 2009; Li et al., 2008; Park et al., 2009; Yu et al., 2007). Breast cancer initiating
cells (BCICs), identified by Clarke MF et al. in an enriched CD44+/CD24− subfraction of
cells, form mammospheres in suspension culture and are often resistant to chemo- and
radiotherapy (Al-Hajj et al., 2003; Dontu et al., 2003; Li et al., 2008; Yu et al., 2007).
Although lapatinib has been shown to be able to stabilize this small population of BCICs in
the clinic (Li et al., 2008), there are no drugs currently available that can effectively reduce
BCICs in patients. Moreover, due to the resistant nature of BCICs to chemo- and
radiotherapy, treatments using these conventional methods have been shown to increase the
BCIC population from 9% to 74% in tumors of the treated patients, and the loss of
responsiveness of BCICs to these treatments will eventually lead to tumor relapse (Li et al.,
2008; Yu et al., 2007). Therefore, it is imperative to develop anticancer drugs targeting
BCICs.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

One key mechanism that accounts for chemo-resistance in cancer initiating cells is low
susceptibility to apoptosis (Park et al., 2009). For example, evasion of apoptosis through
deregulated mitochondrial apoptosis machinery is essential for tumor initiation and
progression, enabling cancer cells to undergo unchecked proliferation, maintain survival,
and acquire drug resistance (Datta et al., 1999; Fesik, 2005; Hanahan and Weinberg, 2000;
McCubrey et al., 2006; Mills et al., 2008). The Bcl-2 family is the primary regulator of the
mitochondrial apoptosis pathway and is classified into three subgroups according to their
Bcl-2 homology (BH) domains: the multidomain antiapoptotic subgroup (Bcl-2, Bcl-xL,
Bcl-w, Mcl-1, Bfl-1/A1), the multidomain proapoptotic subgroup (Bax, Bak), and the BH3only proapoptotic subgroup (Bid, Bim, Bad, Bik, Noxa, Puma, Bmf, Hrk) (Certo et al.,
2006). An intricate balance of members within these three subgroups of Bcl-2 family
determines the outcome of death signals. Interestingly, several reports have indicated that
Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL, which are antiapoptotic members of the Bcl-2 family, may be involved in
the survival of leukemia and glioblastoma cancer initiating cells (Domen and Weissman,
2000; Konopleva et al., 2006; Liu et al., 2006).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Unlike normal cells, expression of proapoptotic members and their antiapoptotic
counterparts are often mismatched to bypass apoptosis in breast cancer cells. For instance,
Bcl-2, Bcl-xL and Mcl-1 are overexpressed in breast cancer cells which is correlated with
high tumor grade and poor prognosis of breast cancer patients (Ding et al., 2007; Hamilton
and Piccart, 2000; Olopade et al., 1997; Silvestrini et al., 1994). In addition, overexpression
of Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, and/or Mcl-1 has also been implicated in the development of drug
resistance in the clinic after chemotherapy such as paclitaxel, doxorubicin, cisplatin, and
bortezomib (Bauer et al., 2005; Ellis et al., 1998; Gomez-Bougie et al., 2007; Oltersdorf et
al., 2005; Tabuchi et al., 2009; Teixeira et al., 1995; van Delft et al., 2006). Since the overall
expression pattern of Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, and Mcl-1 appears to inversely correlate with apoptotic
response following drug treatment, an antagonist that targets all of these antiapoptotic
proteins would be expected to have the greatest proapoptotic efficacy and a broader and
more effective application in different breast cancer cells. However, it is not yet clear
whether this approach will be applicable to BCICs, which are a major determinant for tumor
recurrence due to their resistant nature to traditional therapies.
Lapatinib, a dual EGFR/HER2 small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor, is one of the drugs
currently used in the clinic for treating HER2-positive breast cancer patients, which
stabilizes but does not reduce the BCIC population in patients (Geyer et al., 2006; Li et al.,
2008). To achieve their clinical efficacy, anti-HER2 drugs such as trastuzumab and lapatinib
greatly depend on their ability to promote apoptosis in cancer cells through HER2 inhibition.
For instance, despite inhibition of p-EGFR, p-HER2, p-Erk1/2, and p-Akt, an inoperative
apoptosis machinery renders breast cancer cells ineffective to trastuzumab or lapatinib-

induced apoptosis (Burris et al., 2005; Mohsin et al., 2005). The acquired resistance of
breast cancer cells to lapatinib has been attributed to overexpression of Bcl-2 and Mcl-1,
suggesting that lapatinib-induced apoptosis requires inactivation of antiapoptotic Bcl-2
family proteins (Martin et al., 2008; Xia et al., 2006).
To develop a therapeutic approach that can promote apoptosis in breast cancer including
BCICs and enhance treatment efficacy of lapatinib, we used a mutant form of BH3-only
proapoptotic protein Bik (BikDD), in which the mutations T33D and S35D were made to
mimic the constitutively phosphorylated form with enhanced binding affinity to its multiple
binding partners Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, Bcl-w, and Mcl-1 (Chen et al., 2004; Day et al., 2006; Li et
al., 2003; Xie et al., 2007; Zou et al., 2002). We first examined the role of BikDD targeting
BCICs compared to individual knockdown or co-silencing of Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, and Mcl-1
using shRNAs. Further, we examined the therapeutic effect of BikDD driven by engineered
breast cancer-selective promoter and in combination with lapatinib in breast cancer cells,
including BCICs.

RESULTS
BikDD effectively induces apoptosis in breast cancer cells and reduces the CD44+/CD24−
population, mammosphere formation, and cancer initiation activity

NIH-PA Author Manuscript
NIH-PA Author Manuscript

To examine the proapoptotic effect of BikDD, a potent mutant form of the proapoptotic Bik
(Chen et al., 2004; Day et al., 2006; Li et al., 2003; Xie et al., 2007; Zou et al., 2002) in
BCICs, we infected breast cancer cells using a pLOVE lentivirus system as described
(Blelloch et al., 2007), with the pLOVE vector carrying the BIKDD gene or a empty control
vector. Cells that were infected with viruses carrying BIKDD significantly induced apoptosis
in MDA-MB-468 cells. Specifically, using cell number counting, MTT and clonogenic
assays, we showed that expression of BikDD significantly inhibited the growth and
clonogenicity of MDA-MB-468 cells compared with the vector control (all p<0.01, Figure
1A). We further found that apoptotic bodies were present in large numbers in BIKDDinfected, but not vector control-infected cells (Figure 1B, left panel), and a high level of
cleaved PARP, which is indicative of apoptosis, was detected in BIKDD-infected cells via
immunoblotting analysis (Figure 1B, right panel). Interestingly, expression of BikDD
reduced the CD44+/CD24− population to 29% of the control in addition to the proapoptotic
effect in total population of MDA-MB-468 cells described above (p<0.01, Figure 1C).
Consistent with previous studies (Gupta et al., 2009; Li et al., 2008), chemodrugs such as
paclitaxel increased this CD44+/CD24− population by almost 3-fold (p<0.01, Figure 1C).
Consequently, BikDD decreased mammosphere formation of MDA-MB-468 parental cells
to 13% compared with the control vector (p<0.01, Figure 1C bottom left). Next, we
examined whether BikDD can block mammosphere formation of mammosphere-selected
tumor cells. We found that BikDD expression via lentivirus infection reduced the number of
re-formed mammospheres of MDA-MB-468 mammosphere cells that was acquired from
MDA-MB-468 parental cells through mammosphere formation culture in vitro (p<0.01,
Figure 1D). Likewise, reduction of CD44+/CD24− population and numbers of
mammosphere formation by BikDD was also found in BT474 human breast cancer cells
(Figure 1E). Similar results were also obtained from MCF7/HER2 cell line (data not shown).
In addition to human breast cancer cell lines, we also examined the effect of BikDD in
patient and mouse MMTV-Neu transgenic primary breast tumor cells. First, we examined
the killing effect of BikDD in radiation-treated patient primary breast tumor cells. As shown
in Figure 2A, patient primary breast tumor cells post radiation therapy contained 29.25% of
CD44+/CD24− population. Under BikDD treatment, the percentage of CD44+/CD24−
population was reduced to 9.75%, i.e. 33% of the control (or 67% inhibition, Figure 2A).
BikDD also decreased the mammosphere formation of these primary breast tumor cells to

25% of the control (or 75% inhibition, Figure 2B). We also obtained similar results from
primary cell culture of another patient breast tumor xenograft model in which patient breast
tumor specimen was directly passaged in nude mice and showed that the CD44+/CD24−
population was reduced to 49% of the control (Figure S1A). In addition, we also examined
the killing effect of BikDD in MMTV-Neu primary tumor cells that were obtained from
MMTV-Neu NDL2-5 transgenic mouse (Siegel et al., 1999). We found that BikDD also
significantly reduced the percentage of either CD24+/CD29+ (Figure 2C, top) or CD24+/
CD49f+ (Figure 2C, bottom) populations, which are biomarkers for mouse breast stem cells
(Liu et al., 2007; Shackleton et al., 2006; Stingl et al., 2006). BikDD was also able to block
the mammosphere formation of MMTV-Neu primary tumor cells and dramatically reduced
the number of formed MMTV-Neu primary mammospheres obtained by mammosphere
culture (both p<0.01, Figures 2D and 2E). Thus, these results suggest that BikDD not only
induces apoptosis in breast cancer cell lines but also eliminates the CD44+/CD24−
population and mammospheres in primary breast cancer cells.

Next, we asked whether BikDD also inhibits cancer initiation activity. To this end, we first
selected for mammospheres from MDA-MB-468 parental cells (referred to as “1°
mammosphere cells”), and then the 1° mammosphere cells were infected with lentivirus
expressing BikDD or vector control. Two days after infection, the survived cells were
typsinized, counted, and injected into NOD/SCID mice with the indicated numbers of cells
(Group B). In this experiment, only 500 1° mammosphere cells were sufficient to induce
tumor formation (Figure 2F). In contrast, the 1° mammosphere cells survived after BikDD
treatment exhibited a significant reduction in tumorgenicity (Group B), suggesting that
BikDD treatment reduced the BCIC population. To ensure this phenomenon can be observed
in the secondary transplants (Al-Hajj et al., 2003; Dick, 2003; Haase et al., 1995; Lapidot et
al., 1996), we harvested the tumor tissues from the vector-control group (since virtually no
tumor was developed in the BikDD-treated group) to isolate primary tumor cells, and
selected for mammospheres (referred to as “2° mammosphere cells”). Again, these 2°
mammosphere cells were infected with lentivirus expressing BikDD or vector-control. Two
days after infection, the survived cells were trypsinized, separated into single-cell
suspension, counted, and then injected into NOD/SCID mice with indicated numbers of cells
(Group C). As shown in Figure 2F, these 2° mammosphere cells from the vector-control
group still maintained their ability to induce tumor in mice with only 500 cells. However,
the 2° mammosphere cells survived after BikDD treatment no longer produced tumor
(Group C). Together, these results suggest that the selected mammosphere cells maintained
their cancer initiation activity by secondary transplants (vector-control group), and BikDD
expression in those selected mammosphere cells significantly inhibited their cancer
initiation activity, most likely by reduction of BCIC population.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Furthermore, in order to address whether BikDD can inhibit cancer initiation activity during
an in vivo tumorigenicity assay, we adopted a gene therapy protocol (described in details
later in Figure 6C), which allows us to assay the cancer initiation activity from tumor
xenografts growing in mice after BikDD treatment. To this end, we treated mice bearing
MDA-MB-468 tumor xenografts with control vector-liposome or VISA-claudin4-BikDDliposome complexes. After treatment stopped, we harvested tumor tissues from mice,
created a single-cell suspension, and then passaged them into new animals with indicated
numbers of cells (Figure S1B). We found tumor cells from mice treated with VISAclaudin4-BikDD-liposome complexes also demonstrated significantly reduced
tumorigenesis in new animals compared to that from mice treated with vector-controlliposome complexes. Specifically, no mice developed tumor in BikDD-treated groups that
received 104 and 105 cells isolated from tumor of the VISA-claudin4-BikDD-treated mice
(Figure S1B). In addition, we also observed a reduction in CD44+/CD24− population and
the number of mammosphere formed upon in vivo VISA-claudin4-BikDD treatment

(Figures S1C and S1D). Taken together, these results indicate that BikDD indeed eliminates
BCICs under a gene therapy setting.

Co-silencing of multiple Bcl-2 antiapoptotic members mimics the proapoptotic effect of
BikDD in BCICs

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

In our previous work, BikDD was shown to have enhanced binding affinity to Bcl-2
antiapoptotic proteins such as Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL compared with the wild-type Bik (Li et al.,
2003). Therefore, we examined the effect of its major binding partners including Bcl-2, BclxL and Mcl-1 in BCICs using an shRNA knockdown approach. Interestingly, co-silencing
Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, and Mcl-1 reduced the CD44+/CD24− population to 25% of the control
MDA-MB-468 cells (Figure 3A) and consequently decreased mammosphere formation of
MDA-MB-468 cells to 10% of the control (Figure 3B). However, we found that individual
knockdown of each of the three molecules only had a partial killing effect in CD44+/CD24−
population and number of mammoshperes, suggesting that Bcl-2 antiapoptotic proteins may
have functional redundancy in the BCIC survival (Figures 3A and 3B). When BikDD was
expressed by infection in these cells as described above (Figures 1A and 1B), we showed
that it reduced CD44+/CD24− population and mammosphere formation to 27% and 10%,
respectively, compared with vector control group, which is comparable to the killing effect
of co-silencing its three major binding partners Bcl-2, Bcl-xL and Mcl-1. Furthermore,
BikDD did not enhance the killing effect against BCICs post co-silencing of all three
molecules (Figure S2). The specificity of shRNAs against these three molecules was
validated by immunoblotting (Figure 3C), supporting that the reduction in CD44+/CD24−
population and number of mammospheres were indeed due to the loss of these protein
expression. Similar results were also obtained from another set of shRNAs against these
three antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins (see Supplemental Information and also data not
shown), in order to exclude the off-target issue of shRNAs. We also carried out the same
experiment in BT474 cells and showed similar results to that of MDA-MB-468 described
above (data not shown). Taken together, we determined that efficient induction of apoptosis
in BCICs requires silencing of all three antiapoptotic Bcl-2 proteins, which suggests that coantagonism of multiple Bcl-2 antiapoptotic proteins by BikDD may have a better killing
effect against BCICs than targeting individual antiapoptotic proteins, which is likely due to
their functional redundancy in the survival of BCICs.
The engineered VISA-claudin-4 promoter is robustly and selectively activated in breast
cancer cells in vitro and in vivo

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

To explore BikDD gene therapy, we search for an expression vector that allows BIKDD
gene to selectively express in breast cancer cells. In our previous work, we developed a
transcriptional targeting vector “VISA” (VP16-GAL4-WPRE integrated systemic amplifier)
based on an engineered expression vector, which can enhance a cancer-specific promoter
activity by several hundred-fold and prolong duration of gene expression without loss of its
cancer specificity. This system has been successfully applied in pancreatic, lung, and
ovarian cancer preclinical models (Sher et al., 2009; Xie et al., 2009; Xie et al., 2007). In
this study, we also utilized this powerful targeting approach to express BikDD in breast
cancer cells under a promoter that is activated in breast cancer cells.
By comparing the mRNA expression level between breast cancer and normal tissues in the
public SAGE and cDNA microarray libraries, we identified several candidate promoters
including claudin-4, fatty acid synthase (FASN), MMP1, and StarD10 (Figure S3A). After
compared their promoter activities in multiple breast cancer cell lines, we found that the
claudin-4 promoter exhibited highest activity among all other promoters tested. Moreover,
this promoter had little activity in normal cell lines and several cancer types (Figure 4A),
suggesting its selectivity for breast cancer.

Although the claudin-4 promoter was selectively expressed in breast cancer cells, its activity
level was only about 1–4% of CMV promoter activity (Figure S3B). Therefore, we
integrated the claudin-4 promoter into the VISA system (Figure 4B). Indeed, the engineered
VISA-claudin4-Luc vector showed robust luciferase activity in almost all of the 13 breast
cancer cell lines tested and was comparable to or higher than that of the CMV promoter
(Figure 4C). In addition, its activity was nearly silent in normal cell lines compared with that
of the CMV promoter (Figure 4C), which further supports its breast cancer selectivity.
Moreover, the expression ratio of luciferase from VISA-claudin4-Luc to CMV-Luc at day 5
was consistently higher than at day 2 in the five breast cancer cell lines tested (Figure 4D),
suggesting that the prolonged duration of gene expression from the VISA vector, which was
likely due to the presence of WPRE, an RNA stabilizing element, in the VISA system as
reported previously (Xie et al., 2007).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

To further examine the breast cancer-specific expression in vivo, we treated mice with
CMV-Luc or VISA-claudin4-Luc plus DOTAP/Cholesterol liposome as the gene delivery
system via tail vein injection at a single dose of 2.5 mg/kg in 4T1 tumor-bearing syngeneic
mice (Templeton et al., 1997; Xie et al., 2007). The mammary tumors were inoculated in the
fourth inguinal mammary gland to prevent overlapping signals from lung and heart in which
CMV promoter was highly activated. We found that the luciferase activity of VISAclaudin4-Luc was selectively localized in the tumor region, while the CMV-Luc activity was
primarily observed in the lung with weak signals in the tumor area after 48 hours (Figure
4E). This result was further confirmed by examining these individual organs, which
demonstrated that the signal of VISA-claudin4-Luc was indeed from the tumor itself and not
from other organs (Figure 4F). Collectively, we conclude that the VISA-claudin4-Luc vector
is robustly and selectively expressed in breast cancer cells both in vitro and in vivo.
The VISA-claudin4-BikDD expression efficiently inhibits breast cancer cells growth in vitro
and in vivo and has less toxicity than CMV-BikDD

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

To investigate the therapeutic efficacy of BikDD, we incorporated BIKDD into VISAclaudin4 vector (Figure 5A) and examined its inhibitory effect on cell growth in a panel of
breast cancer and normal cell lines. Compared with CMV-BikDD, VISA-claudin4-BikDD
demonstrated comparable or stronger inhibitory effects on cell growth of different breast
cancer cell lines (Figure 5B). In contrast, it had virtually little or no effect on the growth of
human normal cell lines MCF10A, 184A1, and WI38 (Figure 5B). This killing effect was
unlikely a result of non-therapeutic component of the VISA system such as GAL4/VP2
synthetic transcription factor because VISA-claudin4-Luc has virtually no effect on the
growth of breast cancer cells (Figure 4C and data not shown). Thus, VISA-claudin4-BikDD
efficiently and selectively killed breast cancer cells in vitro, consistent with the luciferase
expression data (Figure 4C).
To evaluate the antitumor efficacy of VISA-claudin4-BikDD in vivo, we tested one
syngeneic mouse breast tumor and multiple human breast tumor orthotopic xenograft
models. First, we used the 4T1-Luc syngeneic mouse mammary orthotopic model and found
that both CMV-BikDD and VISA-claudin4-BikDD, at 0.75mg/kg, twice per week for 3
weeks, greatly reduced 4T1 tumor growth and prolonged mouse survival in vivo (Figures
5C–E, both p<0.01). Consistently, both CMV-BikDD and VISA-claudin4-BikDD
effectively reduced tumor growth and prolonged mice survival in a human breast orthotopic
xenograft model (Figures 5F and 5G, both p<0.01). Notably, VISA-claudin4-BikDD
suppressed tumor growth and prolonged mice survival more significantly than CMV-BikDD
(Figures 5D, 5F and 5G, both p<0.05).
Similar results were also obtained from other breast cancer orthotopic models such as
MCF7/HER2, BT474, and MDA-MB-468 (see later in Figure 6C, all p<0.05). In addition,

expression of BikDD mRNA containing the WPRE RNA stabilizing element is readily
detectable and can be distinguished from endogenous wild-type Bik in tumor tissues of
MCF7/HER2 and BT474 xenograft models after VISA-claudin4-BikDD treatment but not in
untreated mice (data not shown), indicating that expression of the therapeutic gene in the
tumors after treatment. We also found that VISA-claudin4-BikDD produced less toxicity
compared with CMV-BikDD in vivo (Figure 5H), without obvious changes in AST, ALT,
and BUN as determined by liver and kidney functional assays, respectively (Figure S4).
These results indicate that VISA-claudin4-BikDD efficiently inhibited tumor growth of
breast cancer xenografts in vivo.
The VISA-claudin4-BikDD synergizes with lapatinib in EGFR+/HER2+ breast cancer cell
lines in vitro and in vivo

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

As previously reported, the clinical efficacies of anti-HER2 agents such as lapatinib and
trastuzumab are greatly limited by either inoperative apoptosis machinery or overexpression
of Bcl-2 antiapoptotic proteins following lapatinib treatment that may be improved by
inactivation of Bcl-2 antiapoptotic proteins (Burris et al., 2005; Martin et al., 2008; Mohsin
et al., 2005; Xia et al., 2006). Therefore, we examined whether BikDD or inhibition of Bcl-2
antiapoptotic members may enhance the therapeutic effect of lapatinib in breast cancer cells.
In this study, we found that VISA-claudin4-BikDD effectively sensitized BT474 and MDAMB-453 (HER2+), and MDA-MB-468 and BT20 (EGFR+) cells to lapatinib (Figure 6A, see
also Figures S5A and S5B for EGFR/HER2 expression and combination index). It should be
mentioned there was virtually no added killing effect under the combination of VISAclaudin4-BikDD plus lapatinib in the EGFR−/HER2− MCF7 human breast cancer cell line
or in MCF10A normal human mammary epithelial cell line (Figure 6A). The lack of
sensitization of VISA-claudin4-BikDD to lapatinib in MCF7 is most likely due to low
expression of EGFR and HER2 (Figure S5A) while the lack of activity in the normal cell
lines is most likely due to the absence of VISA-claudin4 expression activity in normal cells
(Figure 4C). Moreover, we determined that this is not a result of low transfection
efficiencies since all cell lines tested using the electroporation method had similar GFP
expression level (data not shown).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

We further examined whether inactivation of Bcl-2 antiapoptotic proteins by siRNAs
sensitized EGFR+/HER2+ breast cancer cells to lapatinib. We found that co-silencing of
Bcl-2, Bcl-xL and Mcl-1 indeed sensitized EGFR+/HER2+ breast cancer cells to lapatinib
that was comparable to BikDD alone, which surpassed individual knockdown of them
(Figure 6B, top) but not in EGFR−/HER2− MCF7 cell line (Figure 6B, bottom left).
However, when HER2 was expressed in the MCF7 cells (Wang et al., 2004), co-silencing of
these three Bcl-2 antiapoptotic members was able to sensitize the cells to lapatinib again
(Figure 6B, bottom right), suggesting that co-antagonism of Bcl-2, Bcl-xL and Mcl-1 by
three specific siRNAs or BikDD alone can overcome the functional redundancy of Bcl-2
antiapoptotic proteins and synergized with lapatinib.
The sensitization effect of VISA-claudin4-BikDD plus lapatinib treatment was further
supported by the enhanced expression level of cleaved PARP (a major apoptosis signal)
under combinational therapy. Combination treatment of VISA-claudin4-BikDD plus
lapatinib enhanced the expression level of cleaved PARP in HER2+ MCF7/HER2 and
EGFR+ MDA-MB-468 cells to about 44.9% or 162.8% more than either single treatment
alone using both VISA-claudin4-Luc and pUK21 plasmid as negative controls (Figure S5C).
These results suggest that the enhanced proapoptotic effect under a combination of VISAclaudin4-BikDD plus lapatinib may contribute to their synergistic effects on the growth of
EGFR+/HER2+ breast cancer cells.

To further examine the therapeutic efficacy of VISA-claudin4-BikDD plus lapatinib
combination in vivo, we treated mice bearing HER2+ BT474 human breast cancer xenografts
with VISA-claudin4-BikDD and/or lapatinib. Lapatinib was administered orally at a dose of
50 mg/kg every other day, and VISA-claudin4-BikDD was intravenously injected as
indicated by arrows in Figure 6C. VISA-claudin4-BikDD or lapatinib alone significantly
inhibited tumor growth compared with the vector alone group (Figure 6C, both p<0.05).
However, the combination treatment of VISA-claudin4-BikDD plus lapatinib demonstrated
even much better therapeutic efficacy than single-agent treatment of either VISA-claudin4BikDD or lapatinib alone (Figure 6C, both p<0.05). A more significant synergy between
VISA-claudin4-BikDD and lapatinib was observed when MDA-MB-468 cells was
transfected by VISA-claudin4-BikDD once before transplanted into nude mice, followed by
lapatinib treatment every other day (p<0.01, Figure S5D). Similar results were also obtained
from EGFR+ MDA-MB-468 orthotopic xenograft model and HER2+ MCF7/HER2 human
breast cancer orthotopic xenograft model (Figure 6C, both p<0.05). Thus, targeted
expression of VISA-claudin4-BikDD sensitized breast cancer cells to lapatinib in vitro and
in vivo and provided additional benefit when combined with lapatinib, ensures that normal
cells or tissues are spared from its potent proapoptotic effect.

In addition, we also explored whether VISA-claudin4-BikDD can sensitize breast cancer
cells to other clinical used drugs since Bcl-2 antiapoptotic proteins have been shown to
contribute to the development of drug resistance following chemotherapy (Ellis et al., 1998;
Oltersdorf et al., 2005; Tabuchi et al., 2009). Among them, we found that VISA-claudin4BikDD also sensitized multiple breast cancer cell lines to paclitaxel in vitro including the
EGFR−/HER2− MCF7 human breast cancer cell line (Figure S5E). However, it should be
mentioned that BikDD sensitized the HER2+ SKBr3 human breast cancer cell line to
lapatinib but not paclitaxel (data not shown), suggesting that the combination of VISAclaudin4-BikDD plus lapatinib may have potential benefits in EGFR+ or HER2+ breast
cancer cells while the combination of VISA-claudin4-BikDD plus paclitaxel may be more
useful for EGFR−/HER2− breast cancer cells.
VISA-claudin4-BikDD treatment efficiently reduces CD44+/CD24− population even after
paclitaxel treatment and markedly attenuates tumor growth at off-therapy stage

Next, we examined the activity of engineered VISA-claudin4 promoter in BCICs. To
determine if VISA-claudin4 vector could drive gene expression in BCICs, we used VISAclaudin4-Luc to measure its promoter activity. As shown in Figure 7A, luciferase expression
of VISA-claudin4-Luc in the CD44+/CD24− population and mammoshpere cells of MDAMB-468, MCF7/HER2, MDA-MB-435, BT549, and HBL100 breast cancer cell lines was
comparable or even higher compared with the total population, indicating the engineered
claudin4 promoter is activated in BCICs, even in claudin-low cell lines (Figure S6). Next,
we examined the therapeutic effect of BikDD in MDA-MB-468 tumor orthotopic xenograft
mouse model. MDA-MB-468 tumor-bearing mice were treated with empty vector, lapatinib,
paclitaxel, VISA-claudin4-BikDD, and VISA-claudin4-BikDD plus lapatinib or paclitaxel.
Consistent with the in vitro data, BikDD treatment significantly reduced the percentage of
CD44+/CD24− population of MDA-MB-468 tumor to 48% compared to vector control (set
as 100%) while paclitaxel treatment increased this population by about 3-fold as expected at
day 26 of last treatment (both p<0.05, Figure 7B). Interestingly, BikDD blocked the
expansion of the CD44+/CD24− population under paclitaxel treatment (p<0.01, Figure 7B).
A reduction in the CD44+/CD24− population in VISA-claudin4-BikDD or VISA-claudin4BikDD plus paclitaxel at day 26 led to significant tumor growth inhibition compared with
paclitaxel alone after drug cessation from day 26 to day 49 (off-therapy stage) with a growth
rate ratio determined from the relative slope of the tumor growth curves of 0.44, 0.45, and
1.45, respectively (Figures 7C and 7D). The relative slopes were determined by measuring

the slope of tumor growth curves in each group during the off-therapy stage from day 26 to
day 49 (calculated from the exponential trendlines in Microsoft Excel) compared to control
vector (Figure 7D). 49 days after first drug treatment, VISA-claudin4-BikDD plus paclitaxel
exhibited better tumor growth suppression compared with VISA-claudin4-BikDD alone
(p<0.05, Figure 7C left). We also found similar results from combination treatment of
VISA-claudin4-BikDD and lapatinib (Figures 7B–D). Collectively, these results indicate
that BikDD driven by VISA-claudin4 vector potently reduced the CD44+/CD24− population
in vivo even after chemotherapy and efficiently attenuated tumor growth after cessation of
drug treatment, suggesting that VISA-claudin4-BikDD treatment may serve as a potential
therapeutic approach to kill BCICs, which is considered as a major barrier for breast cancer
treatment.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Taken together, the current study suggests a potential therapeutic approach for breast cancer
treatment by showing: 1) BikDD effectively reduced BCICs through co-antagonism of its
major binding partners Bcl-2 antiapoptotic proteins; 2) the engineered VISA-claudin4
promoter was selectively activated in breast cancer cells including BCICs; 3) targeted
expression of BikDD driven by VISA-claudin4 vector demonstrated potent anti-tumor
activities in multiple syngeneic and orthotopic mouse models, synergized with lapatinib and
paclitaxel, and attenuated tumor growth at off-therapy stage by reducing BCICs. Therefore,
it is worthy of moving VISA-claudin4-BikDD into a clinical trial, which will provide
potential benefit in breast cancer patients by triggering apoptosis in both non-BCICs and
BCICs.

DISCUSSION
There is increasing evidence to support that conventional cancer therapies which are able to
kill the bulk of differentiated cancer cells within tumors have failed to eliminate cancer
initiating cells (Gupta et al., 2009; Park et al., 2009). Residual cancer cells such as BCICs
will reform new tumor and eventually lead to tumor relapse in patients. At present, there are
no effective treatments available for treating BCICs in the clinic, which are urgently needed
for relapsed breast cancer patients. However, it is worth mentioning that Gupta et al.
recently identified a compound that can specifically kill BCICs (Gupta et al., 2009). Thus,
agents as such which can target BCICs are worthy of moving into clinical trials.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

In this study, we found that antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family of proteins play an important role in
maintaining survival of BCICs, and elimination of these chemo-resistant cancer initiating
cells required co-antagonism of Bcl-2 antiapoptotic proteins either through BikDD
expression or co-silencing of Bcl-2, Bcl-xL and Mcl-1 (Figures 1–3). We have provided
evidence to show that co-antagonism of Bcl-2 antiapoptotic proteins via BikDD not only
markedly reduced BCICs, but also effectively killed non-BCICs in multiple breast cancer
cell lines, which surpassed knockdown of them individually. Since multiple Bcl-2
antiapoptotic members were redundantly and highly expressed in several breast cancer cell
lines including BT474 and MDA-MB-468 (Figure S5A), this could explain why coantagonism of Bcl-2 antiapoptotic proteins had better therapeutic effect than inhibition of
them individually. Inhibition of the CD44+/CD24− population and mammosphere formation
by BikDD expression in patient and mouse primary tumor cells suggests its potential clinical
therapeutic value. Moreover, the killing effect of BikDD against BCICs is likely mediated
through co-inhibition of the three major binding partners Bcl-2, Bcl-xL and Mcl-1 because
BikDD did not further enhance the killing effect against BCICs post co-silencing of these
three molecules which were validated in both MDA-MB-468 and BT474 cell lines (Figure
S2).

Practically, it would be advantageous to develop a breast cancer therapy that can target
breast cancer cells including BCICs through inhibition of antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family of
proteins. To this end, we engineered a breast cancer targeting VISA-claudin4 vector to
express the therapeutic gene selectively in breast cancer cells including BCICs. Although
claudin-4 protein were reported to be expressed in breast tissue during lactation and other
cancer types (Hewitt et al., 2006), the expression level of claudin-4 was significantly lower
in breast normal tissues compared to breast cancer according to the data obtained from the
public SAGE and microarray database (70:1200 ratio), which was further supported by other
studies (Kominsky et al., 2004; Soini, 2004). In addition, we also examined its promoter
activity in claudin-low cell lines that have been shown to correlate with BCICs (Hennessy et
al., 2009; Kuo et al., 2009; Neve et al., 2006). This 1100-bp truncated fragment of claudin-4
promoter, which was originally cloned from claudin-low MDA-MB-435 cells, exhibited
comparable or higher activity in claudin-low subtype compared with luminal and basal A
subtypes, with little expression in normal breast cancer cell lines (Figure S6). Moreover, it
still processed comparable promoter activities in the CD44+/CD24− population and
mammosphere cells compared with parental cells after constructing it into the VISA system
even in the claudin-low subtype breast cancer cell lines (Figure 7A), suggesting that this
region of the claudin-4 promoter is an excellent candidate for transcriptionally-targeted
breast cancer therapy.

Next, we demonstrate significant antitumor activities of VISA-claudin4-BikDD in a mouse
syngeneic and multiple human orthotopic xenograft breast cancer models in vitro and in vivo
(Figures 5C–G, and Figure 6C), which strongly suggest its feasibility for breast cancer
treatment. For breast cancer treatment, anti-HER2 drugs such as lapatinib and trastuzumab
have been widely used in HER2+ breast cancer patients (Geyer et al., 2006; Li et al., 2008).
However, their clinical efficacy appeared to be limited by inoperative apoptotic machinery
or overexpression antiapoptotic members of Bcl-2 family proteins after drug treatment
(Martin et al., 2008; Xia et al., 2006). Indeed, BikDD sensitized HER2+ breast cancer cells
to lapatinib, which was mimicked by co-inhibition of antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins by
three combined siRNAs but not individually. Moreover, BikDD also sensitized EGFR+
breast cancer cells to lapatinib, which has been reported to be less effective under lapatinib
treatment compared with HER2+ cells (Konecny et al., 2006). In addition to that, we also
found that BikDD can sensitize multiple breast cancer cell lines to paclitaxel including
EGFR−/HER2− MCF7 cells (Figure S5E), suggesting that the combination of VISAclaudin4-BikDD plus paclitaxel may provide some benefits in EGFR−/HER2− breast cancer
cells. Thus, the evidence shown here greatly supports our notion that apoptosis-promoting
agents like BikDD delivered by the VISA-claudin4-vector would be expected to provide
additional therapeutic benefits to lapatinib treatment in EGFR+/HER2+ breast cancer cells
and may be potentially used for EGFR+/HER2+ breast cancer patients following our
pancreatic VISA-based targeting vector (Xie et al., 2007), which is in the process of being
moved into human clinical trials.
Moreover, we demonstrated that the engineered VISA-claudin4 promoter was activated in
the CD44+/CD24− population and mammosphere cells (Figure 7A) (Casagrande et al.,
2011). BikDD treatment not only significantly reduced the BCIC population of MDAMB-468 in vitro and in vivo but also dramatically blocked the CD44+/CD24− population
expansion under paclitaxel treatment while paclitaxel alone greatly enhanced this population
after drug treatment (Figures 1C and 7B). Of note, BikDD was also able to reduce the
CD44+/CD24− population and mammosphere formation in radiation-treated patient breast
tumor cells (Figures 2A and 2B). Reduction of CD44+/CD24− population by BikDD or its
combination with paclitaxel or lapatinib greatly attenuated tumor growth at off-therapy stage
from day 26 to day 49 post first drug treatment (Figures 7C and 7D). These results strongly
suggest that BikDD can eliminate BCICs, even after chemotherapy, and VISA-claudin4Cancer Cell. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2012 September 13.

BikDD gene therapy may provide an effective strategy to inhibit breast tumor growth
including BCICs.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

In summary, our study uncovered the important role of Bcl-2 antiapoptotic proteins in the
survival of BCICs, and co-inactivation of antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins is required to
reduce BCICs and sensitize EGFR+/HER2+ breast cancer cells to lapatinib, suggesting a
potential therapeutic strategy targeting BCICs. As it has been shown that non-BCICs can
also transit into BCICs at a significant rate under certain condition (Gupta et al., 2009), it
would be advantageous to develop such a therapeutic agent that can target both population
of breast cancer cells. By using our newly developed VISA-claudin4-BikDD for treating
breast cancer, it is likely that therapeutic efficacy will be enhanced and potential side effects
prevented as we have shown that BikDD targets both non-BCICs and BCICs and
demonstrates virtually no toxicity in normal cells.

EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
Patient primary tumor specimen

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Patient breast tumor specimen was collected within 1 hour after surgery under the guidelines
approved by the Institutional Review Board at MD Anderson Cancer Center, and written
informed consent was obtained from patients in all cases at time of enrollment. The tumors
were minced into small pieces, and were digested by collagenase/hyaluronidase for 3–16
hours (Stemcell Inc. #07912). Cells were further cultured in Matrigel-coated 6-well plate
using MEGM complete medium (Lonza/Clonetics, #cc-3051).
In vivo mouse models
All animal procedures were conducted under the guidelines approved by the Institutional
Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) at MD Anderson Cancer Center. Female BALB/
cA normal and athymic mice (Harlan laboratories Inc, Houston, TX) were used as hosts for
tumor xenografts. Mice were divided according to the mean value of tumor volume or
photon signals in each group. For MCF7/HER2 and BT474 cell lines, 17β-estradiol with
biodegradable carrier-binder (Innovative Research of America, Sarasota, FL) was inoculated
under the mice skin 3 days before tumor injection. Lapatinib was administered orally at 50
mg/kg every other day (Scaltriti et al., 2007). Paclitaxel was injected intravenously at 3 mg/
kg every other day. VISA-claudin4-BikDD plus liposome mixture was injected
intravenously at 0.75 mg/kg as indicated by arrows in the figures. Tumor was measured
twice weekly with a caliper, and tumor volume was calculated by the formula: π/
6×length×width2.

SIGNIFICANCE
The Bcl-2 family of proteins is essential for tumorigenesis and development of resistance
to chemotherapies. However, in this study, we uncovered an important role of Bcl-2
antiapoptotic proteins in the survival of BCICs. Due to the functional redundancy of
Bcl-2 antiapoptotic proteins, co-inhibition of these proteins is required to optimally
reduce BCICs and sensitize breast cancer cells to lapatinib. We also demonstrated that
inactivation of multiple Bcl-2 antiapoptotic proteins by their proapoptotic partner,
BikDD, through an expression vector selective for breast cancer produced a profound
killing effect and synergized with lapatinib in animal models. Taken together, the current
study provides a therapeutic strategy worthy of future clinical trials, with extra benefit for
breast cancer patients by triggering apoptosis in BCICs.

Figure 1. BikDD effectively reduced the CD44+/CD24− population and mammosphere formation
of breast cancer cells

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

(A) MDA-MB-468 cells were infected with lentivirus containing BIKDD or vector alone,
and were analyzed by cell numbers, MTT and clonogenicity assays (setting at 100% in
vector group). (B) Cells were imaged, and were immunoblotted by N-terminal Bik antibody
and cleaved PARP antibody, respectively. Scale bar indicates 10 μm. (C) 200,000 MDAMB-468 cells were analyzed by flow cytometry 7 days post infection or paclitaxel treatment
once at 1.0 μg/ml dose using fluorescent-conjugated CD44 and CD24 antibodies. The data
represent the mean of three independent experiments. For mammosphere formation assay,
indicated cells were used and the mammospheres was counted under microscope with size
≥100 μm. (D) MDA-MB-468 mammospheres established as above were infected with
lentivirus containing either vector alone or BIKDD, and the number of re-formed
mammospheres were counted within 7 days. Scale bar indicates 50 μm. (E) BT474 cells
eliminated the CD44+/CD24− population and mammosphere formation of BCICs. All error
bars indicate SD.

Figure 2. BikDD significantly reduced the BCICs of patient and mouse MMTV-Neu primary
tumor cells and blocked in vivo tumorigenesis of mammosphere cells

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

(A–B) patient primary breast tumor cells were isolated from radiated-patient primary tumor
after surgery, as described in experimental procedures. After BikDD treatment, cells were
subjected to FACS analysis. 3,000 cells were used for mammosphere formation, and
mammospheres were counted with size at >100 μm. (C) Mouse MMTV-Neu primary tumor
cells were isolated from primary tumor in MMTV-Neu transgenic mouse and subjected to
FACS analysis using either mouse CD24+/CD29+ (top) or CD24+/CD49f+ (bottom)
fluorescent-conjugated antibodies after BikDD treatment. (D) For mammosphere formation,
5,000 cells were used and mammospheres were counted with size >100 μm. (E) MMTVNeu primary mammospheres were treated with either vector alone or BikDD via lentivirus
infection, and mammospheres were counted after reformation. Scale bar indicates 50 μm.
(F) Indicated numbers of parental MDA-MB-468 cells and mammosphere cells with or
without BikDD treatment, were inoculated into the mammary fat pad of NOD/SCID mice,
and mice were monitored for the next months for tumorigenesis. All error bars indicate SD.

Figure 7. BikDD treatment efficiently reduced the CD44+/CD24− population of MDA-MB-468
mammosphere-induced tumors in mice, while VISA-claudin4-Luc was activated in BCICs

(A) BCICs from MDA-MB-468, MCF7/HER2, MDA-MB-435, BT549 and HBL100 cells
isolated by either FACS sorting or mammosphere culture, were transient transfected with
VISA-claudin4-Luc, with pRL-TK as internal control. The luciferase signal was measured in
each population of unsorted parental cells and BCICs, normalized with DNA concentration
of firefly/renilla luciferase to exclude the potential different transfection rate. The
percentage of the luciferase signals as compared with unsorted total population (setting at
100%) was presented. (B) The CD44+/CD24− population of MDA-MB-468 tumor in the
different groups were determined at Day 26 (the day of last drug treatment). The P-values
shown were obtained by comparison with the control group. (C) For off-therapy study, we
monitored tumor growth in different group after treatment stopped at Day 26 post first drug
treatment, and the tumor growth rate (slope) of off-therapy stage (day 26 to day 49) was
calculated by exponential trendline in Excel software (D). All error bars indicate SD. See
also Figure S6.
