Treatment of Small-Cell Lung Cancer in
Elderly Patients
Athanasios G. Pallis, MD, PhD1; Frances A. Shepherd, MD2; Denis Lacombe, MSc1; and Cesare Gridelli, MD3

Small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) represents 15% to 20% of all lung carcinomas. Approximately 30% to 40% of these
cases are diagnosed in patients older than 70 years of age. Staging of SCLC classifies patients as having either limited or extensive-stage disease. The standard treatment for limited-stage disease is platinum-based chemotherapy,
combined with external-beam thoracic radiotherapy, whereas platinum-based regimens alone represent the standard
of care for extensive-stage disease. In the elderly population, treatment of SCLC is more challenging given the
decline in physiological organ reserve and the presence of comorbidities. The majority of data are drawn from retrospective studies, which are likely to suffer from selection bias. However, limited prospective data are available to
guide treatment decisions in that special population. Nonetheless, these data demonstrate that standard approaches
are feasible in carefully selected elderly patients. The purpose of this article is to review the currently available

KEYWORDS: SCLC, elderly, age, elderly specific trials, chemotherapy, radiotherapy.

Lung cancer remains the leading cause of cancer-related death in both men and women in Western countries.1 Smallcell lung cancer (SCLC) represents approximately 15% to 20% of primary lung carcinomas. The incidence of SCLC has
decreased during the last 2 decades probably as a result of decreased tobacco use.2 SCLC is characterized by a rapid doubling time, a propensity for early dissemination, significant sensitivity to chemotherapy and radiotherapy, and development of drug resistance during the course of disease.3 Staging of SCLC is based on the Veterans Administration Lung
Study Group system, which classifies patients as having either limited-stage (disease that is limited to 1 hemithorax, with
hilar and mediastinal nodes that can be encompassed within 1 tolerable radiotherapy portal) or extensive-stage disease.3
As a result of an increasing life expectancy, the elderly population is experiencing a rise in the incidence of lung carcinoma. Data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) registry indicate that about 32% of newly
diagnosed SCLC cases occur in patients older than 70 years of age, whereas approximately 10% of cases are diagnosed in
patients older than 80 years of age.4 On the basis of these observations, it is clear that SCLC represents a significant health
problem in the elderly.
The cutoff point at which an adult is considered ‘‘elderly’’ has not been well defined. Usually, 70 years of age is considered a reference point and is commonly used in clinical trials in oncology.5 Available literature notes that several agerelated physiologic changes occur, especially at or around age 70 years, which increase the risk of chemotherapy-induced
toxicity; hence, age 70 years is widely accepted as the cutoff for elderly specific analyses. However, many studies have used
a lower age cutoff. Another important issue in the interpretation of results of clinical trials conducted with elderly patients
is the inclusion or not of the so-called ‘‘very old’’ patients, who are those aged 80 years or older. The number of these ‘‘very
old’’ individuals who will be diagnosed with lung cancer is going to increase in the next few years.6 However, treatment
decisions should be based on physiological rather than chronological age.
Despite the high incidence of SCLC in the elderly population, elderly patients are frequently under-represented in
clinical trials that are evaluating new cancer treatments.7 Indeed, statistically significant under-representation of the elderly
was noted in registration trials for all cancer treatments except breast cancer hormonal therapies, and this underCorresponding author: Athanasios G. Pallis, MD, PhD, EORTC Headquarters, EORTC-ETF, Avenue E. Mounierlaan, 83/11, B-1200 Brussels, Belgium; Fax: (011) 32

representation was even more pronounced for patients 70
years or older.8 As a result, the applicability of the results
of these trials to the elderly population is limited because
physiologic changes associated with the aging process and
the presence of comorbidities may have an impact on cancer treatment tolerability and outcome.5
The purpose of this review is to focus on the management of SCLC in the elderly population. The issues
that will be covered are radiotherapy and chemotherapy
for limited-stage and extensive-stage SCLC.
Search Strategy and Selection Criteria
A bibliographic search of the Medline database was
conducted by using the keywords small-cell lung cancer,
elderly, chemotherapy and radiotherapy, and chemoradiotherapy. The search was limited to articles written in English. Only data from phase 3 trials or phase 2 trials were
incorporated. Studies with subgroup analysis of treatment
efficacy for elderly patients and retrospective analyses
comparing elderly patients with nonelderly counterparts
were included. The Medline search was supplemented by
a manual search of meeting abstracts (World Conference
on Lung Cancer, European Society of Medical Oncology
Annual Congress, American Society of Clinical Oncology
Annual Meeting, and European Lung Cancer Conference) as well as reference lists of original and review
articles.
Management of Limited-Stage SCLC
The standard of care for patients with good performance
status and limited-stage disease is combined concurrent
chemoradiotherapy. Patients should receive 4 to 6 cycles
of a platinum-based chemotherapy doublet combined
with early (with Cycle 1 or 2) radiotherapy.9,10
Combined chemoradiotherapy for elderly SCLC
patients

A retrospective analysis of SCLC (both limited and
extensive stages) patients included in clinical trials in a
French region from 1981 to 1994 did not demonstrate
that age was an independent prognostic factor for survival.11 Conversely, a recently published retrospective
analysis of the SEER database examined the outcome of
patients with limited-stage SCLC.12 In the multivariate
analysis, patients were divided into 3 age groups (<60,
60-69, and 70 years of age), and older age was associated
with a statistically significant increase in mortality hazard.
Owonikoko et al analyzed the SEER database for lung
cancer outcome during the period 1988 to 2003.4 Almost

48,000 cases of SCLC were evaluated. The overall survival
rate at 5 years was lower in the very elderly group of
patients (80 years of age). However, it should be noted
that this group of patients was less likely to receive local
therapy (radiotherapy) than younger patients, and 47% of
these patients did not receive any kind of local therapy.
Overall outcomes for patients who received local therapy
were comparable to those of younger patients.4 Finally, a
retrospective review of 174 patients with limited-stage
SCLC was reported by Ludbrook et al.13 Patients were divided into 3 age groups: <65 years (n ¼ 55; 32%), 65-74
years (n ¼ 76; 44%), and 75 years (n ¼ 43; 25%).
Increasing age was significantly associated with fewer
diagnostic scans. Combined modality chemoradiotherapy
(CRT) was given in 86%, 66%, and 40% of patients ages
<65, 65-74, and 75 years, respectively (P < .0001).
Thoracic irradiation use was comparable among the age
cohorts (P > .05). Advancing age was significantly associated with less intensive chemotherapy regimens, fewer
cycles, and lower total doses (P < .05). Prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI) was used in 41 patients, only 3 of
whom were aged >70 years. Positive outcomes, in terms
of overall response rates, significantly decreased with
advancing age (overall response rates of 91%, 79%, and
74% in age cohorts <65, 65-74, and 75 years of age,
respectively; P ¼ .014). Treatment toxicity and relapse
patterns were similar across the age cohorts. Overall
2-year survival rates were significantly lower with advancing age, 37%, 22%, and 19%, respectively for age cohorts
(P ¼ .003), with corresponding median survivals of 17,
12, and 7 months. Conversely, on multivariate analysis,
age and Charlson comorbidity scores were not significantly associated with treatment response and survival.
Furthermore, a retrospective, age-specific subgroup analyses of a Spanish hospital database by Jara et al indicated
that outcome measures, namely toxicity, overall response
rate, progression-free survival, and overall survival, did
not differ significantly among age groups (<70 and 70
years of age).14 Several other retrospective studies evaluated the impact of age on treatment and outcome in
SCLC (Table 1).13-17 In all of these studies, elderly
patients received less intensive treatment in terms of
chemotherapy dose or number of cycles.13-17 Radiotherapy was either less intensive in the elderly (dose reductions, less frequent use)14 or comparable between younger
and elderly patients.13 For toxicity, some studies reported
higher toxicity for the elderly cohort,16 whereas others did
not.13-15 For overall survival, the results are conflicting, as
some studies reported similar survival between young and

Optimizing radiotherapy

The addition of radiotherapy (RT) to platinumbased chemotherapy offers a 5% benefit in 3-year survival18; however, this benefit is mainly confined to
younger patients (<55 years of age), with a trend toward
an adverse outcome in patients 70 years of age or older.18
The North American Intergroup Trial 0096 demonstrated that hyperfractionated (twice daily) accelerated
radiotherapy offers a survival benefit compared with conventional daily fractionation (both radiotherapy arms in
combination with 4 cycles of combined cisplatin and etoposide), although at a cost of increased toxicity, especially
esophagitis.19 The issue of increased toxicity has raised
concerns about the feasibility of this approach in elderly
SCLC patients.
A retrospective age-specific analysis of the Intergroup 0096 trial was reported by Yuen et al.20 Of the 381
patients enrolled in the original study, 50 (13%) were age
70 years or older. There was a trend toward higher 5-year
overall survival for younger patients (<70 vs 70 years of
age; 22% vs 16%, respectively; P ¼ .05). Response rate

.18), time to local failure, and duration of response did
not differ among age groups. Severe hematologic toxicity
(grade IV-V, <70 vs 70 years of age; 61% vs 84%,
respectively; P < .01) and fatal toxicity (<70 vs 70 years
of age; 1% vs 10%, respectively; P ¼ .01) occurred more
often among older patients, and there were no differences
in the incidence of nonhematologic toxicities.
Quon et al reported a combined, retrospective
analysis of 2 randomized trials (BR.3 and BR.6) of the
National Cancer Institute of Canada Clinical Trials
Group.21 BR.3 randomly allocated patients to RT at a
dose of 25 Gy in 10 fractions or 37.5 Gy in 15 fractions. In BR.6, RT at a dose of 40 Gy in 15 fractions
was given concurrently with chemotherapy with randomization to either the early (Cycle 2) or late (Cycle
6) radiation. A total of 665 patients entered these 2 trials. Of these, 608 patients were eligible for analysis. The
number of patients younger than age 70 years was 520,
and 88 patients were aged 70 years or older. There was
no difference between the 2 age groups in the proportion of patients who completed RT, although patients
70 years of age were less likely to complete high-dose
RT. There was no difference between the 2 age groups
in the time to complete RT, mean dose delivered, or in
the incidence of acute and late treatment-related toxicities. No statistical difference in response rate, local

relapse rate, or overall survival was seen between
younger and older age groups.
Finally, Schild et al reported results of a retrospective
analysis of a North Central Cancer Treatment Group
phase 3 trial.22 This trial compared chemotherapy (cisplatin and etoposide) plus either twice-daily RT (BIDRT) or
once-daily RT (QDRT). The trial failed to show any difference between these 2 treatment arms.23 The original
study enrolled 263 patients; 54 of them were 70 years of
age. Elderly patients experienced significantly more toxicity (grade IV pneumonitis, <70 vs 70 years of age; 0%
vs 6%, respectively; P ¼ .008) and treatment-related
deaths (<70 vs 70 years of age; 0.5% vs 5.6%, respectively; P ¼ .03). Despite the higher incidence of treatment-related morbidity and mortality for elderly patients,
there was no significant survival difference. The 2-year
and 5-year survival rates were 48% and 22% for younger
patients compared with 33% and 17% for older patients
(P ¼ .14).
However, it should be noted that this evidence
comes from retrospective studies, which are likely to suffer
from selection bias, and the conclusions may not be representative of the entire elderly population but only of
patients considered eligible for such an aggressive treatment as combined chemoradiotherapy.
Elderly specific approaches

An elderly specific phase 2 trial evaluated a regimen
of carboplatin (400 mg/m2 on Days 1 and 29) and oral
etoposide (50 mg/m2, Days 1-21 and 29-49) combined
with accelerated hyperfractionated radiation at a dose of
1.5 Gy twice daily (to a total dose of 45Gy) in 72 SCLC
patients 70 years of age or older and with limited stage disease.24 Treatment was well tolerated with grade III thrombocytopenia being the most frequent toxicity, and only 1
patient developed grade IV toxicity. The overall response
rate was 75% with 57% of the patients achieving complete response. Overall survival was 15 months and 5-year
survival 13%. The authors concluded that this was a tolerable and active regimen deserving further study.
Another phase 2 study reported by Murray et al25
included both elderly, infirm, and noncompliant patients.
Patients were treated with 1 cycle of combined cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and vincristine followed 3 weeks
later by 1 cycle of cisplatin and etoposide; both regimens
were administered at full conventional doses. Radiotherapy was administered concurrently with the second chemotherapy cycle (20 to 30 Gy). The overall response rate
was 89%, median was overall survival 54 weeks, and 5-

year survival was 18%. Unfortunately, the results were
presented for the entire group of patients and not separately for the elderly subgroup. There were 3 treatmentrelated deaths.
Management of Extensive Stage SCLC
Combination chemotherapy regimens are the backbone
of treatment for patients with extensive-stage SCLC. The
addition of RT does not improve survival.3,9 The combination of cisplatin and etoposide remains the most widely
used regimen.3 The addition of a third drug, substitution
of etoposide by irinotecan, use of higher chemotherapy
doses, changes in the schedule of chemotherapy cycle, duration of chemotherapy and maintenance approach, and
the use of alternating chemotherapy regimens have all
failed to improve the results.3
A Spanish randomized phase 3 trial has compared the standard cisplatin and etoposide doublet
with a high-dose epirubicin and cisplatin doublet in
patients with both limited- and extensive-stage disease.26 This trial enrolled 338 patients <70 years of
age and 64 patients 70 years of age.27 In younger
patients with limited-stage disease, a higher time to
progression (36 weeks vs 32 weeks; P ¼ .004) and
overall survival (47 weeks vs 42 weeks; P ¼ .005)
were observed, whereas there was no difference in
patients with extensive-stage disease. No significant differences were observed when the toxicity profiles of
each group were compared except for a higher rate of
febrile neutropenia observed in the elderly group with
extensive-stage disease (<70 vs 70: 4.6% vs 8.8%; P
¼ .01). In the subgroup of patients with limited-stage
disease, elderly patients received less total cisplatin
(dose, 401 vs 508 mg/m2; P ¼ .01), and less treatment delays were reported (10 days vs 15 days; P ¼
.05). The authors concluded that age was likely to be
a negative prognostic factor for the overall survival of
elderly patients with limited-stage disease and that it
was related to a greater dose reduction.
Substitution of carboplatin for cisplatin

Cisplatin-based regimens offer a survival benefit in
SCLC patients when compared with regimens without
cisplatin.28,29 However, the toxicity of cisplatin remains a
serious clinical problem. Nausea and emesis are often
severe and delayed, and neurotoxicity, renal toxicity, and
ototoxicity are significant and dose-related. Conversely, in
terms of nausea, vomiting, and renal toxicity, carboplatin
has a more favorable toxicity profile when compared with

cisplatin30 and may make platinum-based treatment
more feasible in elderly patients who, because of cardiopulmonary comorbidities and renal insufficiency, may
not be candidates for cisplatin. Furthermore, given the
practical advantage of carboplatin in terms of ease of
administration, it could be argued that the small benefit
achieved with cisplatin relative to carboplatin may not justify its use in clinical practice particularly in extensivestage disease where cure is not the goal.
A recently published phase 3 trial compared a carboplatin and etoposide doublet to split doses of cisplatin and
etoposide in elderly or poor-risk patients.31 Patients were
randomly allocated to carboplatin AUC5 (Day 1) and
etoposide 80 mg/m2 (Days 1-3) or to cisplatin 25 mg/m2
(Days 1-3) and etoposide 80 mg/m2 (Days 1-3). Both regimens were given with granulocyte-colony–stimulating
factor support in a 21-28–day cycle for 4 courses. A total
of 220 patients were randomized. No significant differences were observed between the 2 arms in terms of grade
III/IV toxicity, with only the exception of thrombocytopenia, which was more pronounced in the carboplatin
arm. Similar overall response rates, time to progression,
and overall survival were observed between the 2 treat-

1196

ment arms. The authors concluded that carboplatin-based
regimens can be considered as an alternative. Unfortunately, results were not reported separately for the elderly
subgroup of patients.
Several phase 2 trials have evaluated carboplatinbased treatment in elderly SCLC patients (Table 2).
Although the majority of these studies reported encouraging results,32-35 with response rates similar to those
observed with cisplatin-based treatment, Larive et al36 and
Gridelli et al37 reported disappointing results with low
response rates and significant hematological toxicity. In
addition, these results observed in elderly patients have
not been compared with corresponding results in younger
patients.
Attenuated treatment for elderly patients

Several phase 2 trials (Table 3) have evaluated the
role of attenuated treatment (single-agent treatment, RT
alone, and best supportive care) in elderly SCLC patients;
however, this approach is considered suboptimal, after the
results of 2 phase 3 studies demonstrated significantly better results for combination therapy.38,39 A retrospective
report presented the results of ‘‘intensive’’ chemotherapy
incorporating vincristine, cyclophosphamide, and doxorubicin (OCA regimen) versus less rigorous regimens (eg,
single-agent chemotherapy, planned dose reductions,
radiotherapy only). ‘‘Intensive’’ therapy was administered
to 32 elderly SCLC patients, ‘‘less rigorous’’ treatment to
34 patients, and 6 received no active treatment. Although
‘‘intensive’’ treatment was associated with a higher overall
survival rate, the overall survival difference was not significant, and toxicity was substantially increased with
‘‘intense’’ treatment.40 However, the OCA regimen is not
considered optimal nowadays. Similarly, Dajczman et al
reported that although there was a significant association
between advanced age and ‘‘suboptimal’’ treatment (BSC,
fewer chemotherapy cycles, smaller doses used), no

significant overall survival difference was observed
between younger and ‘‘optimally’’ treated patients compared with elderly and ‘‘suboptimally’’ treated patients.17
Conversely, Shepherd et al41 reported that elderly SCLC
patients who were treated with optimal chemotherapy (either cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and vincristine, or
etoposide and cisplatin) had substantially higher overall
survival compared with patients treated with ‘‘suboptimal’’ treatment (no therapy, RT alone, less than 3 cycles
of chemotherapy).
Elderly specific approaches

A prospective phase 2 trial where 95 elderly (70
years of age) patients were randomized to a full-dose cisplatin and etoposide regimen plus G-CSF support (cisplatin 40 mg/m2, Days 1-2, and etoposide 100 mg/m2, Days
1-3 every 3 weeks, plus lenograstim 5 mg/kg Days 5
through 12 every 3 weeks) or to an attenuated-dose cisplatin and etoposide regimen (cisplatin 25 mg/m2, Days 1-2,
and etoposide 60 mg/m2, Days 1-3 every 3 weeks).42 Fulldose chemotherapy was associated with a higher response
rate (69% vs 39%) and longer survival (41 weeks vs 31
weeks). Treatment was well tolerated in both groups;
hematological toxicity was more pronounced in the fulldose arm with 12% of patients developing grade III/IV
hematological toxicity versus 0% for patients in the attenuated-dose arm.
A low-dose combination of cisplatin, doxorubicin,
vincristine, and etoposide (PAVE regimen) was tested by
Westeel et al43 with very encouraging results (response
rate 92% in limited-stage disease, 87% in extensive stage
disease; median overall survival, 16.2 and 10.8 months for
patient with limited-stage and with extensive-stage disease, respectively).
An interesting prospective study by Di Maio et al
evaluated 2-drug combinations of gemcitabine with either
vinorelbine, etoposide, cisplatin, or carboplatin (G-STEP
program).44 The gemcitabine with vinorelbine, gemcitabine with etoposide, and gemcitabine with cisplatin regimens were rejected because of lack of activity. Twenty
patients received gemcitabine (1000 mg/m2 Days 1 and

Cancer

March 1, 2010

8) and carboplatin (AUC3.5) with a response rate of
60%. The authors’ conclusion was that the gemcitabine
with carboplatin combination seemed promising and warranted further investigation.
Platinum-free treatment

Platinum-free regimens have been evaluated by
Hainsworth et al45 (weekly docetaxel and gemcitabine
combination) and Bonn et al46 (vindesine with etoposide)
in patients with extensive-stage SCLC. Although both
regimens were well tolerated, they possessed only modest
activity. Furthermore, these results have not been compared with platinum-based approaches or to corresponding results in younger patients (Table 4).
Prophylactic Cranial Irradiation
Prophylactic Cranial Irradiation (PCI) in patients with
limited-stage47 and extensive-stage disease48 results in a
reduced risk of symptomatic brain metastases and
improved survival. Considerations have been raised that
PCI could be related to neuropsychological impairments
and abnormalities.49 There is a complete lack of data concerning the role of PCI in elderly SCLC patients. Therefore, the use of PCI in elderly SCLC should take into
account the estimated absolute benefit, life expectancy,
treatment tolerance, presence of neurocognitive comorbidities and patient preferences.

DISCUSSION
Aging is associated with several physiologic changes in
organ function that could alter drug pharmacokinetics
and have an impact on cytotoxic chemotherapy tolerability and toxicity.50 Another important issue is that
aging is associated with a significant prevalence of
comorbid diseases. Comorbidities have a significant
impact on patient performance status and may have an
impact on patient ability to tolerate treatment, both of
which may be contraindications for cancer treatment
or may influence overall survival.51 When evaluating
elderly patients, it is very important to effectively select
those patients who are suitable for treatment.

1197

Review Article

Treatment decisions should be based on physiological
rather than chronological age.52 Aging is a highly individualized process, and all the changes that occur cannot be predicted on the basis of chronological age
alone. One possible approach, besides clinical evaluation, is to try to predict functional status and toxicity
on the basis of biological biomarkers.53 Although several biological parameters have been used to predict
functional status and outcome in elderly patients, none
have been prospectively validated.53 Comprehensive
Geriatric Assessment (CGA) is one of the procedures
developed to evaluate elderly patients’ functional status
for the purpose of improving treatment outcomes. The
CGA estimates a patient’s functional status, the presence of comorbidities, mental status and emotional
conditions, social support, nutritional status, polypharmacy, and the presence or absence of geriatric syndromes.54,55 Data concerning CGA and its ability to
detect covert health problems in the elderly cancer
population are consistent, suggesting that CGA procedures should be used more frequently in everyday clinical practice. Furthermore, CGA also shows promise in
identifying health parameters linked to severe treatment-related toxicity in oncologic patients.56 Information obtained is additional to that of chronological age
and performance status.57 However, although CGA
clearly reveals extra information, and the International
Society of Geriatric Oncology (SIOG) recommends a
CGA-based approach to elderly cancer patients, CGA
is man-power intensive and a time-consuming procedure. The feasibility of implementing it in daily or ordinary clinical practice remains a challenge, and the
best form of CGA for cancer patients remains to be
defined.58
Small-cell lung cancer represents a significant health
problem in the elderly population. There is a clear need
for prospective, elderly specific trials for this disease.
Much of the data currently available are based on age-specific retrospective analyses of trials that have enrolled
patients without an age limit. These trials, however, are
highly likely to suffer from selection bias, as only elderly
patients considered ‘‘healthy enough’’ would have entered
those studies. Results from clinical trials conducted in
younger patients cannot be extrapolated to the general elderly population. Elderly patients have more comorbidities and tend to tolerate aggressive chemotherapy,
radiotherapy, or combined-modality treatment less well
than their younger counterparts. Thus, prospective, elderly specific clinical trials are mandatory to provide evi-

1198

dence-based recommendations for the treatment of this
special population.
