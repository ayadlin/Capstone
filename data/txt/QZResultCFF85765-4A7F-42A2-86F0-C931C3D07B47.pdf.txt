The degree of posttranslational modifications of tubulin is
dependent on the developmental stage of the tissue (10–13).
Posttranslational modifications of mouse embryo brain tubulins
are low and comparable with nonneuronal HeLa cell tubulin
modifications. However, during mouse development, the degree of
brain tubulin modification strongly increases; in particular, the
expression of h-tubulin isotypes, which changes qualitatively and
quantitatively (10). Similarly, isolated neurons from fetal mouse
brain in primary cultures undergo neuronal development and
reveal increased posttranslational tubulin modifications, including
polyglutamylation, acetylation, and detyrosination (14). These
effects can also be mimicked in nerve growth factor (NGF)induced outgrowth of rat pheochromocytoma PC12 neurites in vivo
(15–17).
Microtubule polymerization and depolymerization are required
for mitosis and neuronal functions. The dynamics of microtubules
in mitotic spindles and the subsequent chromosome segregation
are affected by all microtubule inhibitors inducing cell cycle arrest
(G2/M arrest; ref. 18). Microtubules accumulate in axons in
response to paclitaxel, whereas Vinca alkaloids induce spiralization
of axon microtubules, and it is thought that the role of
microtubules in axon transport and neurite elongation contribute
to the toxicity of microtubule inhibitors (19). Disruption of axonal
microtubules results in peripheral sensory-motor neuropathy,
which is one of the most common side effects associated with
Vinca alkaloids (e.g., vincristine) or taxane (e.g., paclitaxel)
treatment and is often a limiting factor in their utility as a
treatment of neoplastic diseases (20–24).
Recently, a novel microtubule inhibitor, indibulin, was
identified in a cell-based screening assay. Indibulin has shown
potent antitumor activity in preclinical models but seems not to
affect neuronal microtubules. Neurotoxicity that is normally seen
with other microtubule inhibitors was not observed with
indibulin (25). In the present study, the mechanism of action
and the absence of neurotoxicity of indibulin were investigated
in more detail.

Abstract
Microtubule inhibitors interfere with microtubule dynamics,
causing cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. These effects are
responsible for the chemotherapeutic activities of members of
the taxane and Vinca alkaloid families in oncology. Unfortunately, a major side effect of the taxanes and Vinca alkaloids
is the development of peripheral neuropathies. Indibulin
(N-[pyridin-4-yl]-[1-(4-chlorbenzyl)-indol-3-yl]-glyoxyl-amid;
D-24851; ZIO-301), a novel synthetic small molecule microtubule inhibitor, destabilizes microtubules and has antitumor
activity but does not exhibit neurotoxicity in preclinical
animal studies. In the present study, it has been found that
indibulin is able to discriminate between highly posttranslationally modified tubulin present in mature neuronal microtubules, and less-modified tubulin present in immature
neuronal or nonneuronal microtubules. Vincristine and
colchicine act on either tubulin equally well. The binding site
of indibulin on mature neuronal microtubules seems to be
inaccessible due to the posttranslational modifications, a
theory that is supported by the observation that indibulin did
not disrupt the integrity of highly modified microtubules
present in neurites of pheochromocytoma (PC12) cells. The
specificity of indibulin for unmodified microtubules seems to
be dependent on the pyridyl moiety of indibulin because
derivatives that have the pyridyl moiety replaced are not able
to discriminate between highly and less-modified tubulins.
The observed broad antitumor activity of indibulin and
the lack of central and peripheral nervous system toxicity in
preclinical studies make it a promising candidate for
development as a cancer treatment. Indibulin is currently in
phase I clinical trials. [Cancer Res 2009;69(1):171–7]

Introduction
The involvement of microtubules in a wide variety of cellular
structures and processes led to the multitubulin hypothesis of
tubulin diversity and distinct microtubule structures within a cell.
Most eukaryotic cells express multiple isotypes of a- and htubulins, and this diversity is further enhanced by posttranslational
modifications of tubulins (1–3). In addition to a- and h-tubulin
isotypes, the microheterogeneity includes a variety of g, y, q, ~, eta,
and FtsZ family members (4). The posttranslational modifications
of the different isotypes include acetylation, phosphorylation,
polyglutamylation, detyrosination, and polyglycylation (1, 2). This
tubulin microheterogeneity is much higher in neuronal cells than
in other cells (5–9).

Materials and Methods
Materials and Cell Lines
Indibulin (N-[pyridin-4-yl]-[1-(4-chlorbenzyl)-indol-3-yl]-glyoxylic acid
amid; Baxter Oncology GmbH) was synthesized as described (25). Other
chemicals including vincristine, vinblastine, colchicine, and tubulin antibodies anti–a-tubulin (Clone B-5-1-2), anti–acetylated-a-tubulin (Clone
6-11B-1), anti–tyrosinated-a-tubulin (Clone TUB-1A2), anti–htubulin (Clone
TUB 2.1), anti–h-tubulin I, II isotypes (Clone JDR.3B8), and anti–h-tubulin
III isotype (Clone SDL.3D10)? were purchased from Sigma. Cy3-conjugated
and peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibodies were obtained from
Dianova. Rat pheochromocytoma (PC12) cells were purchased from
American Type Culture Collection (CRL-1721) and Chlamydomonas
reinhardtii (CW15) was a gift from D. Sültemeyer (University of
Kaiserslautern, Kaiserslautern, Germany).

centrifugation at 20.000 g for 15 min, supernatant (Flagella extract) was
dialysed against TDSA buffer (pH 7.5; 10 mmol/L Hepes, 5 mmol/L MgSO4,
1 mmol/L DTT, 4% Sucrose). Deflagellated cell bodies were washed with
2 pellet volumes of HMDS-buffer [10 mmol/L Hepes, 5 mmol/L MgSO4,
1 mmol/L DTT, 4% sucrose (pH 7)] and centrifugation (2,000 rpm, 5 min).
After resuspension in HM-buffer cells [10 mmol/L Hepes, 1 mmol/L MgSO4,
1 mmol/L DTT, 100 mmol/L GTP, 500 Amol/L PMSF, 240 mmol/L sucrose,
0.2% Nonidet-P40 (pH 6.8)], bodies were lysed by sonification (intensity 70%,
10 cycles, 1 min each). Finally, cell debris was separated by centrifugation
(20,000 g, 30 min). Treatment of tubulin with flagella extract from
Chlamydomonas reinhardtii (CW15). Calf brain tubulin (1.8 mg) was
polymerized in the presence of GTP (1 mmol/L) for 20 min at 37jC.
Subsequently, 1 mmol/L Acetyl-CoA and 0.25 mL flagella extract was added
and mixture was incubated for 1 to 1.5 h at 37jC. Samples were put on ice for
1 h and then centrifuged at 20,000 g at 4jC for 30 min. Supernatant was
analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting.
Treatment of tubulin with cell body extract from Chlamydomonas
reinhardtii (CW15). After addition of GTP (1 mmol/L) bovine brain tubulin
(17.5 Ag/AL) in PEM buffer [100 mmol/L PIPES-NaOH, 1 mmol/L EGTA,
1 mmol/L MgSO4 (pH 6.6)] was incubated for 10 min at 37jC in a total
volume of 100 AL to allow tubulin polymerization. Subsequently, 150 AL of
cell body extract from Chlamydomonas reinhardtii in HM-buffer [10 mmol/
L Hepes, 1 mmol/L MgSO4, 1 mmol/L DTT, 100 mmol/L GTP, 500 Amol/L
PMSF, 240 mmol/L sucrose, 0.2% Nonidet-P40 (pH 6.8)] was added and the
mixture was incubated for 0 h to 4 h as indicated. Subsequently samples
were centrifuged (20,000 g, 4jC, 30 min) and the pellets were resuspended in
PEM buffer. Suspensions were placed on ice for 1 h to depolymerize
microtubules. After centrifugation (20,000 g, 4jC, 30 min) tubulin was
recovered in the supernatant and used in the tubulin polymerization assay
as described (27).

Purification of Tubulin from Bovine Brain
Tubulin was purified from bovine brain as previously described (26).
Bovine brain (ages 12–18 mo) was obtained directly after slaughter and
stored in ice-cold PEM-buffer [100 mmol/L PIPES-NaOH, 1 mmol/L EGTA,
1 mmol/L MgSO4 (pH 6.6)]. Large blood vessels and meninges were
removed. Cerebral cortex (600 g) was mixed in a commercial blender with
PEM-buffer containing 0.1% 2-mercaptoethanol (900 mL), in 2 lots for 4 s
each at low speed. The suspension was homogenized in a Teflon-in-glass
homogenizer (2 passes at 1,700 rpm; Potter S., B. Braun Biotech
International) the homogenate centrifuged [12,000 rpm (GSA rotor), 2jC,
90 min], and the supernatant incubated with 1 mmol/L GTP at 37jC
for 30 min under gentle shaking. It was then transferred into 250 mL
centrifuge bottles and carefully underlayered with 30 mL of a freshly
prepared sucrose solution, warmed to 37jC (PEM buffer containing 10%
sucrose and 1 mmol/L GTP). After centrifugation (11,000 rpm, 37jC,
45 min), the pellet was resuspended in ice-cold PEM buffer (2.5-fold pellet
volume) and incubated on ice for 30 min while being homogenized in a
Teflon-in-glass-homogenizer. After additional centrifugation (18,000 rpm,
2jC, 30 min), the supernatant was incubated with 1 mmol/L GTP (37jC,
20 min) and centrifuged again (18,000 rpm, 30 min, 37jC). The pellet was
frozen in liquid nitrogen for storage. The frozen pellet was rapidly thawed,
resuspended in 4 mL ice-cold PEM buffer, and transferred in a Teflonin-glass-homogenizer followed by incubation on ice for 45 min. Every
15 min, the suspension was homogenized with 5 passes. The homogenate
was then centrifuged in 1.5 mL tubes (15,000 rpm, 40 min, 2jC) and the
supernatant used directly in the tubulin polymerization assay or stored at
80jC.

Tubulin Polymerization Assay
The assay was basically performed according to Bollag and colleagues
(27). Tubulin heterodimers (10 Amol/L) from calf brain (Sigma or tebu-bio
GmbH) or bovine brain (purified as described above) were incubated with
compounds as indicated in PEMT buffer [100 mmol/L PIPES-NaOH,
1 mmol/L EGTA, 1 mmol/L MgSO4, and 0.05% Triton-X-100 (pH 6.6)]
containing 1 mmol/L GTP at 37jC for 1 h. Samples (75 AL) were transferred
to a 96-well Millipore Multiscreen Durapore hydrophilic 0.22-Am pore size
filtration plate that had been previously washed with 200 AL PEM buffer
[100 mmol/L PIPES-NaOH, 1 mmol/L EGTA, 1 mmol/L MgSO4 (pH 6.6)]
under vacuum. Microtubules recovered on the filters were stained with
50 AL of Amido Black solution [0.1% naphtol blue black (Sigma), 45%
methanol, and 10% acetic acid] for 2 min. Unbound dye was removed under
vacuum by 2 additions of 200 AL of destaining solution (90% methanol and
10% acetic acid). The microtubule-bound dye was then eluted by incubation
with elution solution (25 mmol/L NaOH, 0.05 mmol/L EDTA, and 50%
ethanol) for 10 min. The elution solution was then transferred to a 96-well
plate and the absorbance measured at 600 nm.

Culture and Differentiation of PC12 Cells
PC12 cells were seeded in Collagen R–coated (Sigma) 6-well plates
(7.5  104 cells per well). NGF-S7 (Sigma) was added in a final concentration
of 100 ng/mL. Media (including NGF) were changed every second day. After
the day 5 cultivation of PC12 cells, the compounds were added to the media
for 24 h and the cells were subsequently subjected to indirect
immunofluorescence staining.
Indirect immunofluorescence microscopy. Cells were incubated with
different compounds as well as DMSO (control) for 24 h and then extracted
for 3 min with ice-cold 0.5% Triton-X-100 in PHEM [60 mmol/L PIPES,
25 mmol/L Hepes, 10 mmol/L EGTA, 2 mmol/L MgCl2 (pH 6.9)] containing
10 Ag/AL paclitaxel (this treatment removes unassembled tubulin while
preserving microtubules). The cultures were then fixed by the addition of
PHEM containing 8% paraformaldehyde and 0.3% glutaraldehyde at 4jC for
10 min. The cells were washed thrice with PBS. After incubation with
blocking solution (PBS containing 2% FCS and 1% bovine serum albumin)
for 30 min, microtubules were visualized using a mouse monoclonal
antibody against acetylated a-tubulin (1:1,000; Sigma) and a Cy3-conjugated
goat anti-mouse antibody (1:1,000), and a cooled AT200 charge-coupled
device camera system (Photometrics Ltd.). Fluorescent images were further
processed using Fluoro-Pro module for Image-ProPlus.

Preparation of Flagella and Cell Body Extract from
Chlamydomonas Reinhardtii (CW15)
Cell body extract from Chlamydomonas reinhardtii (CW15) was prepared
as previously described (28, 29). Cells were centrifuged for 5 min at
2,000 rpm and resuspended in ice-cold 10 mmol/L Tris-HCl (pH 7.0)
containing 5% sucrose and adjusted to 5 to 6  108 cells/mL. While stirring
the suspension pH was decreased from 7.0 to 4.5 by adding acetic acid
(0.5 N). Within 30 s flagella became detached from cell bodies. After
detachment, pH was immediately adjusted to 7.0 by adding KOH (0.5 N).
Aliquots of 10 mL of the suspension were transferred into 15 mL tubes and
underlayered with 10 mmol/L Tris-HCl (pH 7.0), containing 25% sucrose. Cell
bodies were separated from flagella by centrifugation twice through 25%
sucrose (10 min at 3,000 rpm). Interphase and 5% sucrose containing flagella
were pooled and centrifuged at 31.000 g for 20 min. The pellet was
resuspended in 50 mL HM-buffer (pH 6.8; 10 mmol/L Hepes, 1 mmol/L
MgSO4, 1 mmol/L DTT, 0.1 mmol/L GTP, 0.5 mmol/L phenylmethylsulfonyl
fluoride (PMSF), 0.24 mol/L Sucrose, 0.2% Nonidet-P40) and incubated on
ice for 15 min to disrupt the membranes. After centrifugation, a pellet
containing the axonema was resuspended in 50 mL HM buffer (pH 6.8)
containing 0.66 mol/L NaCl and incubated on ice for 30 min. After

Generation of Indibulin-Resistant Cell Line
The indibulin-resistant subline of mouse leukemia L1210 cells (L1210/
indibulin) was generated by long-term adaptation in a medium with
stepwise increasing concentrations of indibulin. Expression of acetylated
and tyrosinated tubulin was analyzed by Western blotting using the
monoclonal antibodies, Clone 6-11B-1 and Clone TUB-1A2, respectively.

Indibulin Does Not Interact with Mature Neuronal Tubulin

Figure 1. Effect of indibulin on polymerization of purified tubulin derived from different developmental stages of bovine brain. A, purified calf brain tubulin and purified
bovine brain tubulin were incubated with GTP and DMSO or with GTP and 1 Amol/L of either Vincristine, Vinblastine or Indibulin, or 10 Amol/L Colchicine in
DMSO. The concentrations of the compounds used in A were based on the minimal concentration that is sufficient to reach the plateau of the inhibition (maximum
inhibition) of bovine brain tubulin polymerisation. See also B. Six independent experiments were performed and corresponding results were comparable. In total, six
preparations of bovine brain tubulin, one preparation of calf brain tubulin, and six batches of commercially available calf brain tubulin from different providers were
examined. B, purified tubulin was incubated with GTP with DMSO alone (100% polymerization) or with different concentrations of vincristine, colchicine, or indibulin.
Polymerized microtubules were separated from heterodimeric tubulin by filtration and recovered on 0.22-Am pore-size filters in a 96-well plate. Subsequently,
microtubules were stained with naphthol blue black, and bound dye was quantified. Inhibition of polymerisation and IC50 values were analyzed using GraphPadPrism
software and were determined from two independent experiments for each compound. Results were comparable.

was inhibited by indibulin in a dose-dependent manner, with an
IC50 value of f0.25 Amol/L and a maximal level of inhibition of
90%. In contrast, polymerization of mature tubulin from bovine
brain was only inhibited up to a maximum of 25%. Vincristine or
colchicine inhibited polymerization of tubulin by f95% to 100%
regardless of the origin of the tubulin (Fig. 1B). The IC50 values for
vincristine and colchicine differed only slightly for bovine or calf
brain tubulins, indicating that these compounds cannot discriminate between tubulins derived from the different sources.

(ages 12 to 18 months; mature tubulins) were used. Tubulins were
allowed to polymerize in the absence or presence of indibulin,
vincristine, vinblastine, or colchicine, and microtubule polymers
were separated from tubulin heterodimers by filtration, as
described (27). All compounds tested completely inhibited calf
brain tubulin polymerization. In contrast, polymerization of mature
tubulin from bovine brain was inhibited only partially by indibulin
but was fully inhibited by Vinca alkaloids and colchicine (Fig. 1A).
As shown in Fig. 1B, polymerization of purified calf brain tubulin

Figure 3. Analysis of calf and bovine microtubule preparations. Microtubules of
calf (C ) and bovine (B ) brain preparations were subjected to SDS-PAGE and
Western blotting using anti–a-tubulin (Clone B-5-1-2; a ), anti–acetylated-atubulin [Clone 6-11B-1; Acetyl.(a)], anti–tyrosinated-a-tubulin [Clone TUB-1A2;
Tyr.(a) ], anti–h-tubulin (Clone TUB 2.1; b) anti–h-tubulin I, II isotype (Clone
JDR.3B8; bI,II ) and anti–h-tubulin III isotype (Clone SDL.3D10; bIII ).

microtubule-associated proteins from microtubules was also
observed at the high salt concentrations present in the flagella
extract (data not shown). The more effective approach, therefore,
was to deacetylate bovine brain tubulin using a cell body extract of
Chlamydomonas reinhardtii containing tubulin-specific deacetylase
(TDA; ref. 30). Bovine brain tubulin was incubated with TDA for up
to 4 hours, preparations were assayed for polymerization at
different time points in the presence or absence of vincristine or
indibulin. Vincristine blocked tubulin polymerization regardless of
the length of treatment with the extract, whereas the extent of
inhibition by indibulin increased with increasing deacetylation;
after 4 h of TDA treatment, indibulin had completely blocked
polymerization of the deacetylated tubulin derived from bovine
brain (Fig. 4). These results indicate that removing the acetyl-group
in a-tubulin restores the ability of indibulin to inhibit neuronal
tubulin polymerization. However, it cannot be excluded that other
tubulin modifications may also occur during the deacetylation
process.
The effect of different inhibitors on neurite outgrowth of
pheochromocytoma (PC12) cells. The PC12 neurite-outgrowth
assay is a suitable and reliable model for predicting the
neurotoxicity of various compounds (15–17, 33). Microtubules in

In general, inhibition of tubulin polymerization by indibulin
ranged from 82% to 100% when using different preparations of
tubulin from calf brains and ranged from 25% to 65% when using
different preparations from bovine brains regardless of whether
they were from different commercial providers or whether they
were prepared in our own laboratory.
Closely related indibulin analogues in which the pyridyl residue
of indibulin is substituted with 8-methyl-quinol-6-yl (D-69429) or
with benzyl alcohol (D-51138) inhibited polymerization of bovine
brain tubulin equally well, and similarly to vincristine and
colchicine (Fig. 2). Both analogues showed slightly less antitumor
activity compared with indibulin in vivo and in vivo (data not
shown).
Characterization of calf and bovine derived tubulin preparations. Posttranslational modifications by acetylation or detyrosination of a-tubulins occur during murine brain development
(10, 11). To investigate microheterogeneity of tubulin derived from
calf and bovine brain in more detail, calf and bovine brain tubulin
preparations were subjected to SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Western
blotting, using antibodies to different tubulin isotypes and
posttranslational modifications. As shown in Fig. 3, a-tubulin and
all types of h-tubulin (h I/h II- and h III-tubulin) were present in
nearly equal amounts in both calf and bovine brain preparations of
tubulin. Acetylated a-tubulin, mostly of neuronal origin, was
abundant in bovine brain but much less abundant in calf brain.
Detyrosinated a-tubulin were higher in bovine than in calf brain.
This indicates that posttranslational modifications such as
acetylation and detyrosination of tubulins may influence the
inhibitory activity of indibulin.
An attempt was made to test whether the ability of indibulin to
inhibit polymerization of calf brain tubulins would be lost if calf
brain tubulins were acetylated. Calf brain tubulins were treated
with an extract containing a-tubulin–specific acetyl-transferase
isolated from flagella of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii (30–32). The
test could not be completed, however, because the high salt
concentrations necessary for the acetylation reaction effectively
inhibited polymerization in all preparations tested. Dissociation of

treatment with cell body extract from Chlamydomonas reinhardtii (CW15).
Purified bovine brain tubulin was incubated with extracts of Chlamydomonas
reinhardtii (CW15) cell bodies. At indicated times, aliquots of treated tubulin were
incubated with GTP with DMSO alone or with indibulin or vincristine at
concentrations of 1 Amol/L in DMSO. Polymerized microtubules were separated
from heterodimer tubulin and quantified as described in Fig. 1A . The y -axis is

independent experiments were performed and corresponding results were
comparable.

microscopy. As shown in Fig. 5A (control), neurites of PC12 cells
form a network of axons of different diameters. When treated with
colchicine, the axons lose their uniform shape and, instead, take on
an irregular, dotted structure (Fig. 5B). Similar effects were seen in
cells treated with the indibulin derivative D-69429 (Fig. 5D). In
contrast, neurites of indibulin-treated PC12 cells retained their
structure and integrity, similarly to control cells (Fig. 5C).
To directly visualize microtubules within neurites, cells were
stained with an antibody that recognizes the acetylated a-tubulins
that are present in neurites but not in cell bodies (15). In control
cells (DMSO treated), microtubules stained strongly and were
highly organized (Fig. 5A). Cells treated with indibulin retained
their highly organized microtubule structure in neurites similarly
to untreated controls. This observation indicates that indibulin
does not affect the stability of neurite microtubules (Fig. 5C). In
contrast, treatment with either colchicine (Fig. 5B) or the indibulin
analogue D-69429 (Fig. 5D) resulted in disruption of neuronal
microtubules and strongly reduced the staining of acetylated
tubulins, confirming that these compounds depolymerize microtubules within neurites. These data support observations made
previously in rats where indibulin had no central nervous system
toxicity and had no effect on peripheral nerve conductance velocity
(25). D-69429 exerted neurotoxicity in the preclinical animal
models similarly to other microtubule inhibitors (data not shown).
Characterization of indibulin-resistant cell line. L1210/
indibulin is an indibulin-resistant cell line derived from the mouse
leukemia L1210 cell line by long-term adaptation to increasing
concentrations of indibulin. As cells adapted to higher concentrations of indibulin (80 nmol/L to 200 nmol/L), levels of acetylated
a-tubulins and detyrosinated tubulins increased (Fig. 6). The
indibulin-sensitive L1210 leukemia cell line contained a low level of
acetylated a-tubulin and detyrosinated a-tubulin (DMSO control;
Fig. 6). These results are compatible with acetylation of tubulin
being a major cause of the resistance of L1210/indibulin to
indibulin. The only acetylation site of a-tubulin is Lys40 (34);
therefore, modification of Lys40 might prevent indibulin from
accessing its binding site.

Discussion
Indibulin (D-24851) was previously shown to have broad
antimitotic activity against a variety of human tumors (25).
Indibulin seemed to cause G2/M arrest by destabilizing cellular
tubulin, as shown in HeLa and SKOV-3 cells by indirect
immunofluorescence. Previously, HeLa cells were shown to contain
only a few tubulin isotypes and modifications compared with the

Figure 5. Effect of indibulin and D-69429 on stability of acetylated a-tubulin
in neuronal dendrites of PC12 cells. Treatment of PC cells with DMSO was used
as a control (A). PC12 cells were exposed to different compounds at
concentrations corresponding to twice the IC50 obtained from the inhibition of
proliferation of PC12 cells using 2,3-bis[2-methoxy-4-nitro-5-sulfophenyl]-2Htetrazolium-5-carboxanilide inner salt assay and GraphPAD Prism software.
Respective concentration of the compounds were 0.24 Amol/L colchicine (B ),

subjected to indirect immunofluorescence using antiacetylated tubulin antibody
or phase-contrast microscopy.

neurites, axons, and dendrites of nerve cells have cell-specific
posttranslational modifications that are distinct from nonneuronal
microtubules (7). Particularly, a-tubulins are highly acetylated in
established neurites (15). Outgrowth of PC12 neurites was induced
by neuronal growth factor for 5 to 6 d followed by treatment with
indibulin, its derivatives, or with colchicine for 24 h (2  IC50 for
each compound). Cells were fixed and visualized by phase contrast

Indibulin was added stepwise at the concentrations indicated. Aliquots of L1210
cells were lyophilized and proteins subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western
blotting with monoclonal antibodies against acetylated or tyrosinated tubulin. The
initial IC50 for indibulin was 80 nmol/L and increased to >340 nmol/L after
stepwise selection for indibulin resistance.

deacetylation activity, Chlamydomonas reinhardtii extract might
also catalyze other tubulin modifications, for example, the addition
of tyrosine to detyrosinated tubulin (29). Therefore, other posttranslational modifications of tubulin, in addition to acetylation,
could play a role in determining its sensitivity to indibulin. In
addition, acetylation and detyrosination of nonneuronal cellular
a-tubulin can be induced through the adaptation of L1210 leukemia
cells to high indibulin concentrations in vitro, suggesting that these
tubulin modification are associated with indibulin resistance.
It is conceivable that the a-tubulin binding site of indibulin
overlaps with the Lys40 position of a-tubulin. The amino group of
Lys40 may interact directly with the pyridyl moiety of indibulin.
Therefore, acetylation of this amino group could interfere with
indibulin binding. When the pyridyl moiety was replaced by
8-methyl-quinol-6-yl (D-69429) or by benzyl alcohol (D-51138), the
tubulin binding activity was not affected by acetylation of Lys40,
and the indibulin derivatives were unable to discriminate between
tubulins derived from nonneuronal tissue or immature neurons
versus mature neurons. It seems that highly modified mature
neuronal microtubules are protected from the destabilizing effect
of indibulin but are sensitive to the indibulin derivatives as well as
to colchicine and Vinca alkaloids. These findings correlate with
previous findings in animal models where indibulin did not cause
the neurotoxicity associated with the other tubulin binders such as
D-69429 or Vinca alkaloids (25).
Indibulin is a novel tubulin binder with cytotoxic activity
comparable with that of taxanes and Vinca alkaloids, but it lacks
the neurotoxicity associated with other tubulin binders in
preclinical models. Its inability to prevent tubulin polymerization
in mature neuronal tubulin, possibly because acetylation of Lys40
of a-tubulin prevents binding, is unique. The resulting lack of
neurotoxicity observed in preclinical models positions indibulin as
a promising chemotherapeutic agent. Indibulin is orally available
and is currently being tested for safety and clinical activity in
Phase 1 studies.

high number found in tubulin isolated from mouse brain (10).
Highly modified microtubules are primarily present in neuronal
tissue, with the degree of modification dependent on the
developmental stage of the tissue (8–13). For example, mouse
neuronal tissue contains highly acetylated tubulin, whereas liver,
heart, spleen, testis, and kidney tissues contain only low levels (34).
Moreover, modifications of nonneuronal tubulin and tubulin
derived from mouse embryos are relatively low, whereas the
degree of modifications, including polyglutamylation, strongly
increases during development of the animals (10, 14). Thus in
general, it seems that nonneuronal tumors would be expected to
contain less posttranslational modifications of tubulin than normal
neuronal tissue. As described previously, indibulin does not seem
to cause the neurotoxicity that normally occurs with other
microtubule inhibitors (25). The present studies were, therefore,
mainly focused on an investigation of the effects of indibulin on
neuronal tubulins to elucidate the molecular basis for the lack of
neurotoxicity of indibulin in vivo. We show here that indibulin can
discriminate between highly posttranslationally modified and lessmodified microtubules.
As observed previously in mice, rats, and guinea pigs in which
brain tubulins from older animals are more extensively modified
posttranslation than in young animals, the tubulins from calf brain
(age 2–6 months; before sexual maturity) and bovine brain (age 12–
18 month) also differ in their degree of acetylation and
detyrosination of a-tubulins. a-Tubulins derived from bovine brain
were shown to be more highly acetylated and detyrosinated than
those from calf brain. The levels of modification seemed to
correlate with sensitivity to indibulin: polymerization of highly
acetylated and detyrosinated tubulins from mature bovine brain
was not affected by indibulin, whereas polymerization of the lessmodified tubulins from calf brain was inhibited by indibulin.
Consistent with the above findings, the integrity of microtubules
in PC 12 neurites that contain highly acetylated a-tubulins (Fig. 5B)
was not affected by indibulin (15). In contrast, colchicine and an
indibulin derivative, neither of which discriminates between
neuronal and nonneuronal cellular tubulins, disrupted the
microtubule structure in these neurites. Thus, acetylation of
a-tubulins in the neurites of both the PC12 cells and in mature
bovine brain seems to make them resistant to the effect of
indibulin. The only acetylation site of a-tubulin, Lys40, is acetylated
(35), and it is possible that modification of this amino acid might
prevent indibulin from accessing its binding site.
This hypothesis is supported by the observation that indibulin is
able to inhibit polymerization of mature bovine brain tubulin as
deacetylation progresses during incubation with an a-tubulin–
specific deacetylase enzyme present in an extract from cell body
Chlamydomonas reinhardtii (29, 30). However, in addition to its
