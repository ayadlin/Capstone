BACKGROUND. The authors evaluated whether the duration of androgen suppression (AS) after the completion of hormone therapy (HT) was associated with the
risk of prostate cancer-specific mortality (PCSM) and all-cause mortality (ACM).

METHODS. The study cohort was comprised of 220 men who received radiation
therapy (RT) and 6 months of HT for prostate cancer between 1996 and 2005.

RESULTS. An increasing duration of AS was associated with a decreased risk of

lower cumulative incidence estimates of PCSM (P 5 .04) if the duration of AS
plus the length of HT administration was 2 years compared with <2 years. After
a median follow-up of 6.1 years, the respective 5-year estimates were 0% and
38%.

CONCLUSIONS. The duration of AS after 6 months of HT was associated with the
risk of PCSM and ACM. This duration could be used to identify men who have
prostate cancer with Gleason scores from 8 to 10 in whom 6 months of HT produces long-term testosterone suppression, which may provide the cancer-specific
survival benefit observed with long-term HT. Cancer 2007;110:1723–8.  2007

andomized trials have documented a prolongation in the time
to prostate cancer-specific mortality (PCSM)1,2 and all-cause
mortality (ACM)2 when 6 months of hormone therapy (HT) and
external-beam radiation therapy (RT), compared with RT alone,
were used to treat men with higher risk prostate cancer based on a
prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level > 10 ng/mL, Gleason score (7–10),
and/or 2002 American Joint Commission of Cancer (AJCC)3 clinical
T (tumor) category (T2b–T4). Therefore, the use of RT and 6 months
of HT has become a treatment option for men with higher risk
prostate cancer. For men who have prostate cancer with Gleason
scores from 8 to 10, however, another standard of care is to administer 2 to 3 years of HT with RT based on the results of prospective
randomized trials4,5 that compared long-term HT with no HT4 or to
short-term HT.5

Prior investigators6–8 have reported longer times
to return serum testosterone levels to noncastrate or
normal levels after the discontinuation of HT in older
men versus younger men, with the time to return to
the baseline testosterone level (BTL) longer than the
time to normalization of the testosterone level across
all age groups.9 Moreover, the return to the BTL parallels the resolution of hypogonadal symptoms,7–9
suggesting that, until a man returns to his BTL, he is
androgen-suppressed. What remains unknown is
whether there is an association between the time to
PCSM and ACM and the length of time that the testosterone level remains below the BTL after the completion of HT. Given the growing evidence regarding
the metabolic side effects of HT with respect to endocrine,10 cardiac,11–13 and bone14 disorders, particularly in men of advanced age, this information would
be of particular importance. Specifically, if the risk of
PCSM decreases significantly as the duration of testosterone suppression increases, then the duration of
testosterone suppression may be useful in identifying
men who have prostate cancer with Gleason scores
from 8 to 10, in whom a 6-month course of HT may
provide the cancer-specific survival benefit associated with long-term HT.5 Therefore, the objective
of the current study was to evaluate whether the duration of androgen suppression (AS) after the completion of HT is associated significantly with time to
PCS and ACM in men who received RT and 6 months
of HT for prostate cancer.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patient Selection, Staging, and Treatment
Between February 1996 and march 2005, BTLs and
follow-up testosterone levels were collected on 220
men who received RT and 6 months of HT for prostate cancer with at least 1 higher risk feature at a
main member or affiliate Harvard Hospital. The PSA
and BTL were obtained within 14 days of the initiation of HT. A higher risk feature was defined as a
PSA level > 10 ng/mL, or a Gleason score 7, or
2002 AJCC clinical T category3 T2b. All biopsy material underwent review by a single pathologist who
had expertise in genitourinary cancers. Prior to study
entry, men had a bone scan and a computerized tomographic or magnetic resonance imaging scan of
the pelvis and were excluded if they were diagnosed
as hypogonadal or had radiographic evidence of regional or distant metastatic disease. A summary of
the pretreatment baseline characteristics of the 220
men who comprised the study cohort is listed in Table 1. All men read and signed an approved Internal
Review Board consent form prior to study entry.

The RT technique that was used in the current
study has been described previously.2 HT consisted
of 2 3-month injections of a luteinizing hormonereleasing hormone (LHRH) agonist (leuprolide acetate) or goserelin and a nonsteroidal antiandrogen
(oral flutamide at a dose of 250 mg every 8 hours or
oral casodex 50 mg once daily). Leuprolide acetate
was delivered intramuscularly every 3 months at a
dose of 22.5 mg. Goserelin was administered subcutaneously every three months at a dose of 10.8 mg.
The nonsteroidal antiandrogen was discontinued on
the 85th day after the administration of the second
3-month preparation of the LHRH agonist.

Testosterone Suppression and PCa Death/D’Amico et al.

Follow-up and Determination of the Cause of Death
The median follow-up for the 220 men in the study
cohort was 6.1 years (interquartile range [IQR], 3.8–
7.7 years), and follow-up was initiated on the last
day of HT and concluded on January 15, 2007 or the
date of death, whichever came first. No patient was
lost to follow-up. Follow-up occurred every 3 months
for 2 years, every 6 months until 5 years, and
annually thereafter. At baseline and within 1 week
before to follow-up, a total serum testosterone level
was obtained using the Bayer assay (Tarrytown, NY),
which has a normal range for men aged 18 years
from 280 ng/dL to 1100 ng/dL, in addition to a PSA
level. HT consisted initially of an LHRH agonist,
which was delivered for life when the PSA level
reached 10 ng/mL in men who experienced PSA failure. The cause of death was determined by the
attending physician who followed the patient from
study entry until death. To record prostate cancer as
the cause of death, there had to be documented, hormone-refractory, metastatic prostate cancer and evidence that the PSA level was rising at the time of the
last follow-up visit despite the use of multiple second-line hormone maneuvers and cytotoxic chemotherapy before death. There were 25 deaths, and 12
of those deaths were from prostate cancer.
Statistical Methods
Calculation of the duration of AS
The duration of AS was defined as the difference in
months between the date when the testosterone level
reached or exceeded the BTL and the last day of the
6-month course of HT. The last day of the 6 months
of HT corresponded to the 85th day after the administration of the second 3-month preparation of the
LHRH agonist. The median and associated 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs)15 of the duration of AS
were calculated within each predefined age strata.
Men whose testosterone level did not reach the BTL
were right censored on the date of last follow-up or
death, whichever occurred first.
Association of the BTL and age with the duration of AS
Logistic regression16 was used to evaluate whether
the covariates of the BTL and age at the end of HT
were associated significantly with whether or not a
man’s testosterone level returned to baseline. A Cox
proportional-hazards model17 was used to assess
whether the same covariates were associated with
the duration of AS in men whose testosterone level
returned to the BTL. Both covariates were considered
as continuous variables for the purpose of the multivariable regression analyses. The adjusted odds ratio
(AOR)18 and the hazards ratio (AHR)17 for return to

1725

the BTL and the duration of AS, respectively, with
associated 95% CIs and P values were calculated for
each covariate.

Association of the duration of AS with death from
prostate cancer and death from any cause
For men whose serum testosterone level returned to
the BTL, Gray19 and Cox17 regression analyses were
used to evaluate whether the duration of AS was
associated with the time to PCSM and ACM, respectively, adjusting for known prognostic factors. Time
zero was defined as the date of return to the BTL.
Prognostic factors included the PSA level, biopsy
Gleason score, clinical tumor category, and (for the
endpoint of ACM) age on the date that the testosterone level reached or exceeded the BTL. For the purposes of univariate and multivariate analyses, the
duration of AS, PSA level, and age were considered
as continuous variables. Gleason scores from 8 to 10,
a Gleason score of 7, and the 2002 AJCC clinical T3
tumor category3 were evaluated as categorical variables, and the baseline groups were men with Gleason score 6 and a clinical T1 or T2 tumor category,
respectively. For all categorical variables, the cut-off
points selected were made prior to examining the
data based on established strata.4
For all regression analyses, the assumptions of
the Cox and Gray models were tested and met. The
unadjusted HR and the AHR16,17,19 for PCSM and
ACM, with associated 95% CIs and P values, were
calculated for each covariate. For the purpose of
illustration, estimates of the time to PCSM and ageadjusted20 ACM estimates stratified at approximately
an 18-month duration of AS were calculated and are
displayed graphically. By selecting 18 months as the
cut-off point for comparing survival estimates, men
were stratified into those with 2 years of testosterone suppression (ie, 18 months of AS and 6 months
of HT) versus < 2 years of testosterone suppression.
Justification for the 2-year cut-off point arises from 2
prospective randomized trials4,5 that established at
least 2 years (ie, from 28 months to 3 years) of HT
and RT as a standard of care for men with high-risk
prostate cancer. A cumulative incidence21 and
Kaplan-Meier (KM)22 methodology were used to calculate estimates for PCSM and ACM, respectively. Ksample23 and the log-rank24 test were used to compare the temporal distribution of these respective
estimates. To ensure that the PSA and BTL followed
a normal distribution, these values were log-transformed. R statistical software (version 2.1.1; R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria)
was used for all calculations pertaining to the Gray
regression and cumulative incidence estimates. SAS

RESULTS
Duration of AS
After 6 months, 12 months, 18 months, 24 months,
and 36 months, we observed that 16%, 38%, 55%,
68%, and 81% of men, respectively, had a return of
testosterone levels to the BTL with a median AS duration of 15 months (IQR, 7–24 months), as shown in
Table 1. Of all men in the study, 19 men (9%) did not
experience a return to the BTL after a median followup of 7.5 years (IQR, 6.2–8.4 years) and a minimum
follow-up of 4.8 years after the completion of HT.
Increasing age at the end of HT was associated significantly with a decreased rate of return to the BTL
(AOR, 0.74; 95% CI 0.55–0.99; P 5 .04) whereas a
higher BTL was not associated with an increased rate
of return (AOR, 2.2; 95% CI, 0.10–48.1; P 5 .62). An
increasing value of the BTL was not associated significantly (AHR, 1.2; 95% CI, 0.7–2; P 5 .45) with the duration of AS; whereas advancing age at the
completion of HT was associated with the duration
of AS (AHR, 0.95; 95% CI, 0.92–0.98; P < .001) with a
median of 12 months (95% CI, 5–18 months), 14
months (95% CI, 9–18 months), and 16 months (95%
CI, 12–18 months) for men ages 60 years, 61 to 64
years, and 65 years, respectively.
Association of the Duration of AS With Death From
Prostate Cancer and Death From Any Cause
Table 2 illustrates a significant association between an
increasing duration of AS and a decreased risk of PCSM

(AHR, 0.89; 95% CI, 0.82–0.96; P 5 .003) adjusting for
the PSA level (AHR, 1.1; 95% CI, 0.5–2.4; P 5 .85), for
Gleason scores from 8 to 10 (AHR, 7.7; 95% CI, 1.2–
48.4; P 5 .03), for a Gleason score of 7 (AHR, 1.4; 95%
CI, 0.1–14.4; P 5 .77) and for clinical T3 disease (AHR,
0.94; 95% CI, 0.1–6.5; P 5 .95). Similarly, after adjusting
for these prognostic factors and age at the time of
return to the BTL (AHR, 1.1; 95% CI, 1.02–1.2; P 5 .01),
the risk of ACM decreased significantly (AHR, 0.94; 95%
CI, 0.89–0.98; P 5 .007) as the duration of AS increased.

PCSM and ACM Estimates
Twelve men (5.5%) experienced PCSM, including 1
man with a Gleason score of 6, 3 men with a Gleason
score of 7, and 8 men with Gleason scores from 8 to
10. Table 2 shows that only the covariates of duration
of AS and prostate cancer with Gleason scores from
8 to 10 were associated significantly with the time to
PCSM on multivariable analysis. The impact of these
2 covariates on the time to PCSM is illustrated in
Figure 1. Specifically, significantly higher estimates of
PCSM (P 5 .04) were observed in men with Gleason
scores from 8 to 10 who had a duration of testosterone suppression <2 years (6 months of HT plus 18
months of AS) compared with men who had a duration of testosterone suppression 2 years. For men
with Gleason scores from 8 to 10, the 5-year cumulative incidence estimates of PCSM were 38% (95% CI,
17%–59%) versus 0% (95% CI, 0%-0%) if the effective
duration of testosterone suppression was <2 years
compared with 2 years, respectively.
Table 2 shows that only the covariates duration
of AS and age were associated significantly with all-

cause survival in multivariable analysis. The impact
of these 2 covariates on the time to ACM is
illustrated in Figure 2. In particular, the age-adjusted
K-M estimates of overall survival and the ageadjusted ACM estimates were significantly higher
(P 5 .04) in men who had a duration of testosterone
suppression <2 years compared with all others. At 5
years, these estimates were 19% (95% CI, 11–27%)
and 7% (95% CI, 0–16%, respectively.

DISCUSSION

FIGURE 1. This graph shows 100% 3 (cumulative incidence estimates;
see Gaynor et al., 199321) of prostate cancer-specific mortality after return
to the baseline testosterone (T) level (BTL) subsequent to 6 months of hormone therapy for the 51 men who had prostate cancer with a Gleason score
from 8 to 10 and a measurable total duration of testosterone suppression
2 years compared with all others (K-sample P 5 .04; see Gray, 198823).

FIGURE 2. This graph shows 100% 3 [1 2 (age-adjusted Kaplan-Meier
estimates [see Kaplan and Meier, 195822] of overall survival)] after return to
the baseline testosterone (T) level (BTL) subsequent to 6 months of hormone
therapy for the 201 men who had a measurable total duration of testosterone suppression that was 2 years compared with all others (age-adjusted
log-rank P 5 .04; see Klein and Moeschberger, 200324).

In the current study of 220 men who received RT and
6 months of HT for higher risk prostate cancer, a significant association was observed after adjusting for
known prognostic factors between the duration of AS
and the risk of PCSM and ACM. The current study
also validated the previously described association
between advancing age and a longer duration of AS
after the discontinuation of HT.6–8
The clinical significance of the current study is
for men who have prostate cancer with Gleason
scores from 8 to 10, for which the accepted standards of care are to administer from 6 months to 3
years of HT with RT based on the results of prospective randomized trials.1,2,4,5 The results of the current
study provide evidence to support the use of the duration of AS after 6 months of HT as a way to identify
men who have prostate cancer with Gleason scores
from 8 to 10 who may achieve the cancer-specific
survival benefit associated with longer term use of
HT.5 Specifically, as illustrated in Figure 1, of the 51
men who had prostate cancer with Gleason scores
from 8 to 10, the 5-year estimates of PCSM were 0%
in 19 men and 38% in 32 men if the duration of testosterone suppression (6 months of HT administration plus the duration of AS) was 2 years compared
with 2 years, respectively. Therefore, what appears
to be relevant when deciding how to manage an
individual patient is the length of testosterone suppression and not simply the length of HT administration. Because it was observed that men of advancing
age in this study and others6–8 experienced longer
intervals of AS after a 6-month course of HT, and
because older men are more likely to experience the
metabolic side effects of HT,10–14 an opportunity to
maximize the therapeutic ratio of HT may exist.
Several points require further discussion. First,
the median duration of AS observed in this study
was 15 months, which was longer than the 4 months
(16.6 weeks) reported in a prior study6 in which 80
men received 6 months of HT. This difference may
be explained by the older median age of the men (69
years vs 66 years) and use of the time to return

(TTR) to the BTL, rather than the TTR to the lower
limit of normal for testosterone, in the current study
compared with the prior study,6 respectively. Second,
in a prior report,9 men with a median age of 65 years
had a median TTR to the BTL of 13.6 months after a
single, 3-month administration of an LHRH agonist,
similar to the results in the current study. Third, it is
clear that an intermittent HT approach would be less
costly and more likely to preserve quality of life.25
However, it remains to be studied in the setting of a
randomized trial whether this approach will produce
an equivalent survival to continuous HT, especially
in a man who rapidly returns his testosterone level
to baseline after completing the initial 6 months of
HT. Finally, in this study, we did not examine the
association of duration of AS and PCSM and ACM in
men who were hypogonadal at baseline. Further
study is needed for this population of men.
In conclusion, the duration of AS after RT and 6
months of HT increases as men age and is associated
with the risk of PCSM. This duration could be used
to identify men who have prostate cancer with Gleason scores from 8 to 10, in whom 6 months of HT
produces long-term testosterone suppression, which
may provide the cancer-specific survival benefit
observed with long-term HT.
