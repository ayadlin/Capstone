BACKGROUND: Despite advantages in terms of cancer control and organ preservation, the benefits of chemotherapy and radiation
therapy (CTRT) may be offset by potentially severe treatment-related toxicities, particularly in older patients. The objectives of this
study were to assess the types and frequencies of toxicities in older adults with locally or regionally advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) who were receiving either primary CTRT or radiation therapy (RT) alone. METHODS: With Surveillance,
Epidemiology, and End Results cancer registry data linked with Medicare claims, patients who were 66 years old or older with locally
advanced HNSCC, were diagnosed from 2001 to 2009, and received CTRT or RT alone were identified. Differences in the frequency of
toxicity-related hospital admissions and emergency room visits as well as feeding tube use were examined, and controlling for demographic and disease characteristics, this study estimated the impact of chemotherapy on the likelihood of toxicity. RESULTS: Among
patients who received CTRT (n 5 1502), 62% had a treatment-related toxicity, whereas 46% of patients who received RT alone
(n 5 775) did. When the study controlled for demographic and disease characteristics, CTRT patients were twice as likely to experience an acute toxicity in comparison with their RT-only peers. Fifty-five percent of CTRT patients had a feeding tube placed during
or after treatment, whereas 28% of the RT-only group did. CONCLUSIONS: In this population-based cohort of older adults with
HNSCC, the rates of acute toxicities and feeding tube use in patients receiving CTRT were considerable. It is possible that for certain
older patients, the potential benefit of adding chemotherapy to RT does not outweigh the harms of this combined-modality therapy.

INTRODUCTION
Head and neck cancer is the fifth most common cancer worldwide with an estimated annual global incidence of more
than 533,000 cases.1 In the United States, almost 53,000 people are diagnosed each year, and 30% to 40% of patients will
die of their disease.2,3 The majority of patients (60%) present with locally or regionally advanced disease, and squamous
cell carcinoma is the most common histology. Forty-three percent of incident cases and 57% of deaths occur in patients
who are 65 years old or older.4
Over the past 2 decades, combined-modality treatment with chemotherapy and radiation therapy (CTRT) has
gained widespread acceptance as numerous studies have demonstrated improved locoregional control and survival in comparison with radiation therapy (RT) alone.5-15 Despite these advantages, the benefit of CTRT may be offset by acute and
often severe treatment-related toxicities, particularly among older patients and those with comorbid medical conditions or
a poor performance status.4,16-19 As a result, 40% to 50% of patients who receive CTRT do not receive the planned number of chemotherapy cycles, and this inevitably reduces the dose intensity and the delivery of optimal regimens.20 This
is of particular concern for patients who are 70 years or older, for whom there may be little benefit from adding chemotherapy to RT.11 Furthermore, the development of chronic and late toxic effects such as speech impairment, dysphagia,
and feeding tube dependence can have a long-term detrimental effect on a patient’s quality of life.4,19,21

Original Article

Although cisplatin-based chemotherapy is the best
studied and most established chemotherapeutic agent,
newer targeted radiation-sensitizing regimens may offer
similar benefits with less toxicity.22,23 Cetuximab, an epidermal growth factor receptor antibody, was approved for
concurrent use with RT after its efficacy, in comparison
with RT alone, was demonstrated in a large randomized
trial.24 That study found no increase in common RTassociated toxic effects, and a subsequent analysis found
no difference in quality-of-life scores between the treatment arms.25 As a result, the use of cetuximab combined
with RT may be replacing RT alone in older, sicker
patients.26 To date, most studies comparing CTRT and
RT alone have focused on oncologic outcomes. Less attention has been paid to the early and late adverse effects of
these treatment approaches. Our objectives were to evaluate the nature and frequency of early toxicities and feeding
tube use in a cohort of older adults with locally or regionally advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinoma
(HNSCC) who received primary CTRT or RT alone.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Data Source

The primary data source was Surveillance, Epidemiology,
and End Results (SEER) cancer registry program records
linked with Medicare claims. SEER, sponsored by the
National Cancer Institute, is a consortium of populationbased cancer registries covering approximately 28% of
Americans in selected states and geographic areas. SEER
collects information about the site and extent of disease,
the first course of cancer-directed therapy, and sociodemographic characteristics for all newly diagnosed cancers,
which are actively followed for the date and cause of
death.27 Medicare is the primary health insurer for 97%
of the US population aged 65 years and older and covers
inpatient hospital care (part A) and outpatient care and
physician services (part B).27 The SEER-Medicare files
were used in accordance with a data use agreement
between the National Cancer Institute and the Centers
for Medicare and Medicaid Services. This study was
reviewed by the institutional review board at the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center and was deemed
exempt from informed consent requirements.
Study Cohort

We identified Medicare beneficiaries who were 66 years
old or older with a pathologically confirmed primary
diagnosis of locally advanced HNSCC arising in the
oropharynx, hypopharynx, or larynx between January 1,
2001 and December 31, 2009. The cohort was limited to
2084

patients with stage III or IV M0 disease as defined by the
American Joint Commission on Cancer criteria.28
Patients were classified as receiving primary CTRT if they
had any claim for RT, at least 1 claim for chemotherapy,
and no cancer-directed surgery within 6 months of their
diagnosis. Patients who had at least 1 claim for RT and no
claims for chemotherapy or cancer-directed surgery were
categorized as receiving primary RT. We excluded
patients enrolled in a Medicare managed care plan (health
maintenance organization) and those who did not have
continuous, complete Medicare coverage from 1 year
before diagnosis through death or the end of follow-up.
Patients diagnosed only at the time of death who had a
history of another malignancy or who had metastatic disease at diagnosis were also excluded.
Outcomes

The primary endpoint was defined as any hospitalization
or emergency room (ER) visit for a diagnosis suggestive of
an adverse effect of chemotherapy or RT. Acute toxicities
included oral complications, hematological complications, gastrointestinal complications, dehydration, deep
venous thrombosis or pulmonary embolus, infection,
fever, cardiac complications, and constitutional symptoms or nonspecific complications of treatment.16,17,29-31
Acute toxicities in these categories were identified by relevant diagnosis and procedure codes in the 6 months
following the date of first treatment. Feeding tube placements were evaluated before and after treatment initiation. Long-term feeding tube use was based on claims for
nutritional support in the durable medical equipment file
or on claims for subsequent feeding tube placement at 1
and 2 years after the initial tube insertion.
Covariates

Demographic characteristics included patient age, sex,
race, geographic location, marital status, and residence in
a metropolitan versus nonmetropolitan county. Median
income in the census tract of residence was used as a
marker of socioeconomic status. Disease characteristics
included the tumor site, clinical tumor stage, lymph node
involvement, and year of diagnosis. Comorbidity was estimated with a modification of the Charlson comorbidity
index based on inpatient, outpatient, and physician claims
in the year before the HNSCC diagnosis.32,33
Statistical Analysis

Unadjusted associations between the type of treatment
and patient characteristics were examined with chi-square
statistics. We estimated the frequency of hospital

regression was used to estimate the impact of chemotherapy on the likelihood of a hospitalization or ER visit associated with acute toxicity, and we controlled for
demographic and disease characteristics. The CochranArmitage trend test was used to evaluate changes over
time in the proportion of all patients receiving CTRT versus RT and the proportion of patients with a hospitalization or ER visit for an acute toxicity. All analyses were
performed with SAS 9.2 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC).
RESULTS
Characteristics of the Cohort

We identified 2277 patients with locally advanced
HNSCC: 66% received CTRT, and 34% received RT
alone (Table 1). The CTRT group was younger and was
more likely to be white, be married, and have a comorbidity score of zero. A greater proportion of the RT group
had laryngeal cancer (55%) versus the CTRT group
(39%), whereas a greater proportion of CTRT patients
had oropharyngeal cancer (47% vs 33%). Over the study
period, the proportion of patients diagnosed with oropharyngeal cancers increased from 34% to 49%, whereas the
proportion diagnosed with laryngeal cancer decreased
from 52% to 42%. A greater proportion of patients were
diagnosed with T3 disease versus T4 disease (36% vs
24%), and this was relatively consistent across treatment
groups (Table 1). There was a decline in the percentage of
patients diagnosed with T4 disease over the study period
(from 26% to 17%), but the proportion of patients diagnosed with T3 disease increased (from 32% to 39%).

(P < .0001; Fig. 1).
Hospitalizations and ER Visits for Early
Toxicities

Sixty-two percent of patients receiving CTRT had a hospitalization or ER visit for 1 or more diagnoses suggestive
of an acute adverse effect, whereas 46% of patients who
received RT alone did (Table 2). Some diagnoses had
greater specificity for chemotherapy use than others. In
particular, patients who received CTRT were more likely
to have a hospitalization or ER visit for gastrointestinal
and hematological toxicities in comparison with their
peers who had RT only.
Controlling for important demographic and disease
characteristics, we found that CTRT patients were twice
as likely to experience any toxicity (Table 3). The CTRT
group was 3 times more likely to have a hospitalization or
ER visit for a gastrointestinal toxicity or hematological
toxicity and twice as likely to experience fever, dehydration, and oral complications. An examination of the
impact of treatment (CTRT vs RT) on the odds of any
toxicity-related hospitalization or ER visit showed an

Acute toxicity was defined as any hospitalization or emergency room visit
for a primary or secondary diagnosis within the specified category suggestive of an adverse effect of chemotherapy or RT within 6 months of a
patient’s first treatment claim. Examining the impact of treatment (CTRT vs

who experienced acute treatment-related toxicities
increased from 40% to 49% over the study period,
whereas the proportion of patients with acute toxicity in

Feeding Tube Use

Seventy-four percent of the CTRT group had a feeding
tube placed at any time after diagnosis, whereas 50% of
RT-only patients did (Table 4). After the initiation of
cancer-directed therapy, 54% of CTRT patients had a
feeding tube, whereas 32% of RT patients did; 40% of
CTRT patients had claims for enteral nutritional support,
whereas 19% of RT-only patients did. Fifteen percent of
CTRT patients and 6% of RT-only patients had a claim
for nutritional 1 year after tube placement. Among those
who had protracted feeding tubes, a greater proportion of
RT-only patients had a skilled nursing facility claim, which
is indicative of posttreatment rehabilitation, in comparison
with CTRT-only patients (44% vs 33%, P < .002).

benefit of CTRT versus RT alone is supported by evidence from numerous studies, the combined-therapy
approach has been associated with poor treatment tolerance and reduced compliance with prescribed dose intensities in certain settings.11,22,34 The type and severity of
treatment-associated toxicity depend on the scope and intensity of the treatment modality, but evidence suggests
that older patients are more susceptible to both early and
late adverse events.4,19
In our population-based study, patients who
received CTRT were more than twice as likely to experience a hospital admission or ER visit for a diagnosis suggestive of an adverse event in comparison with patients
who received RT alone. Moreover, patients in the older
age groups and patients with greater comorbidities were
significantly more likely to experience a toxicity in comparison with younger healthier patients. This is concerning because of the increasing use of CTRT versus RT in
older, sicker patients.26 In fact, it has been reported that
before 2006, both age and comorbidity were significant
predictors of CTRT use, with younger, healthier patients
more likely to receive CTRT. In recent years, however,
these factors are no longer predictors.26 Although it is
thought that this could be due to the approval of the less
toxic monoclonal antibody cetuximab in 2006, our results
suggest that older, less healthy patients are still predisposed to concerning treatment-related toxicities.

their combination.35 Mucositis is one of the most significant and dose-limiting acute toxicities associated with
RT, and patients may develop oral pain, dysphagia,
weight loss, and the need for feeding tubes as a result of
this complication.16,19 A systematic review found that the
incidence of severe mucositis was 34% in patients who
received RT alone and 43% in patients who received concurrent CTRT.16 In the current study, patients who
received CTRT were significantly more susceptible to oral
complications in comparison with those who had RT
only (30% vs 18%), and the proportion of patients with
severe mucositis was notably different (12% vs 3%). Our
results are similar to those of at least 1 other study in
which mucositis severe enough to warrant a hospital
admission was present in 10% of patients receiving
CTRT.18 Rates of mucositis-related hospitalizations were
similar in younger and older patients receiving CTRT.4
In addition, it is widely appreciated that the oral complications among patients receiving CTRT leads to phlegm
accumulation and gagging. This may explain the notable
proportion of CTRT patients who experienced gastrointestinal complications in comparison with RT-only
patients (10% vs 3%). Nausea and vomiting are also common side effects of many chemotherapy regimens and particularly those containing cisplatin.
After the initial treatment period, poor swallowing
function can remain a persistent problem for a nonnegligible fraction of patients who receive CTRT and those
who receive RT only.19 In our population-based cohort of
older patients, 56% of those who received CTRT had a
feeding tube inserted during or after treatment, whereas
33% of those who had RT alone did. At 1 and 2 years after
the initial tube placement, the proportion of CTRT
patients dependent on a feeding tube was almost 3 times
that of the RT-only group. Although we could not
measure the impact of feeding tube use on quality of life,
these patients likely had poor functional outcomes related
to the inability to eat by mouth. Despite these findings, a
significantly greater proportion of patients in the RT-only
group had posttreatment rehabilitation. CTRT patients
are at high risk for acute and late-effect dysphagia, one
of the critical sequela of this being aspiration. Available
data indicate that swallowing rehabilitation can improve
outcomes, and although the data are limited, early intervention appears to be superior to any delays in
treatment.36
Between 2003 and 2007, we observed a notable
increase in the proportion of patients in the RT-only
group who had an acute toxicity. It was during this time
period that CTRT use, which had remained relatively
2088

stable previously, began to increase, and there was a
corresponding decline in the use of RT alone. If treatment
with RT only was increasingly reserved for the frailest
patients, then this group would represent those most susceptible to the toxicities of treatment and hence most
likely to have hospital admissions or ER visits for an
adverse event.24 Alternatively, RT techniques, dosing, and
schedules may have evolved during the specified time period, and this may have resulted in a greater risk of
treatment-associated toxicity.37
Several limitations of our analysis should be noted.
First, in the absence of detailed clinical information, we
were unable to define chemotherapy and RT dosages or to
determine whether patients received a full course of therapy.38,39 Second, we identified only patients with acute
complications severe enough to warrant a hospital admission or ER visit. Thus, our analysis likely underestimates
the total incidence of most toxicities.40 In addition, we
could not accurately distinguish induction chemotherapy
from the typical course of concurrent CTRT. Although
we were able to control for important patient and tumor
characteristics, there may have been residual confounding
by unmeasured factors, such as pretreatment functional
status, other risk factors for chemotherapy-related adverse
effects, and patient and physician preferences. Finally, it
was not possible to determine the location of treatment,
which may have affected the degree of on-treatment
supportive care received.
In conclusion, in this population-based cohort of
older adults with HNSCC, the rates of acute toxicities and
feeding tube use in patients receiving CTRT were considerable. Although the survival benefit associated with
CTRT is well established in younger patients, it is not clear
whether the benefit of adding chemotherapy to RT exceeds
the risk of toxicity associated with this therapy in certain
older patients. Risk-stratified approaches may improve
overall outcomes in HNSCC by directing more aggressive
treatment modalities to patients with a greater likelihood
of benefit and a greater ability to tolerate side effects. Such
strategies would reduce the use of combined-modality
therapy in those who are least likely to benefit from it and
least able to tolerate it, spare them unnecessary toxicity,
and reduce costs to the patient, the payer, and society
at large.
