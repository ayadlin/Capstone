Abstract

Author Manuscript

Calcineurin inhibitors such as cyclosporin A (CsA) are the mainstay of immunosuppressive
treatment for organ transplant recipients. Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the skin is a major
complication of treatment with these drugs, with a 65–100 fold higher risk than in the normal
population1. By contrast, the incidence of basal cell carcinoma (BCC), the other major
keratinocyte-derived tumour of the skin, of melanoma and of internal malignancies increases to a
significantly lesser extent 1. Here we report that genetic and pharmacological suppression of
calcineurin/NFAT function promotes tumour formation in mouse skin and in xenografts, in
immune compromised mice, of H-rasV12 expressing primary human keratinocytes or keratinocytederived SCC cells. Calcineurin/NFAT inhibition counteracts p53-dependent cancer cell
senescence thereby increasing tumourigenic potential. ATF3, a member of the “enlarged” AP-1
family, is selectively induced by calcineurin/NFAT inhibition, both under experimental conditions
and in clinically occurring tumours, and increased ATF3 expression accounts for suppression of
p53-dependent senescence and enhanced tumourigenic potential. Thus, intact calcineurin/NFAT
signalling is critically required for p53 and senescence-associated mechanisms that protect against
skin squamous cancer development.

The selectively increased risk of SCC formation in CsA-treated patients1 suggested that that
calcineurin signalling, central to keratinocyte growth/differentiation control 2–4, plays an
intrinsic role in keratinocyte tumour suppression. Mice with keratinocyte-specific deletion of
the calcineurin B1 gene (CnB1), essential for calcineurin activity 3, exhibited increased

susceptibility to chemically-induced carcinogenesis, with decreased latency, higher
incidence and size of tumours, and earlier malignant conversion (Fig. 1a, Suppl. Fig. 1).

Author Manuscript

To assess the relevance of these findings to human skin, primary human keratinocytes
(HKCs) were infected with an oncogenic H-rasV12-transducing retrovirus, followed by skinreconstitution grafting assays onto immune compromised (Scid) mice. In control mice, HrasV12-expressing HKCs produced an acanthotic epithelium with normal pattern of
differentiation. In CsA-treated mice, grafted cells gave rise to tumours with disordered
proliferation and histopathological features of moderately to poorly differentiated SCC (Fig.
1b; Suppl. Fig. 2a). Similar results were obtained by cell injection at the dermal-epidermal
junction, i.e. a location approximating that of malignant skin tumour formation. Rasexpressing HKCs formed only differentiated epidermal cysts in control animals, while, in
animals treated with CsA or the unrelated calcineurin inhibitor FK506, they produced highly
cellular lesions with decreased differentiation (Fig. 1c, Suppl. Fig. 2b). Similar lesions were
produced by H-rasV12-expressing HKCs with siRNA-mediated knock-down of the CnB1
gene (Fig. 1c, Suppl. Fig. 2c), and in mice treated with a calcineurin/NFAT inhibitory
peptide (VIVIT)5, versus control scrambled peptide (VEET) (Suppl. Fig. 2d–f).

Author Manuscript

Cutaneous SCCs are characterized by mutation and/or decreased expression of p53, but only
10–20% have ras mutations6, raising the question of the relevance of the present findings for
cancer cells without ras activation. Nucleotide sequencing showed that SCC12 and SCC13
cells, two independent lines from cutaneous SCC with poorly aggressive properties 7, have
wild type ras genes and, as reported 8,9, single p53 missense mutations. Up-regulation of
endogenous p53 in these cells still induces “canonical” effectors like p21WAF1/Cip1 10,
possibly through an indirect mechanism like the reported ability of mutant p53 to bind and
titrate p6311,12, a negative regulator of p21 expression and senescence in keratinocytes13,14.
Injection of SCC12 and SCC13 cells at the dermal-epidermal junction resulted in
differentiated cysts. By contrast, in mice treated with CsA or VIVIT, or as a consequence of
p53 knockdown, SCC cells formed highly cellular and moderately differentiated infiltrating
tumours (Suppl. Figs.3,4a).

Cancer cell senescence is a failsafe mechanism against tumour development15 which can be
associated with increased expression of terminal differentiation markers16. Staining for
senescence-associated β-galactosidase activity (SA-β-Gal)17 was positive in lesions formed
by ras-expressing HKCs or SCC13 cells in control but not CsA-treated mice (Fig. 1d, Suppl.
Fig. 5a). This was paralleled by differences in Ki67 and K1 differentiation marker
expression (Suppl. Fig. 6). Similarly decreased SA-β-Gal staining was found in tumours
formed by ras-expressing HKCs with knockdown of CnB1 or, as predicted from the
literature, of p53, a key mediator of oncogene-induced senescence15 (Fig. 1e, Suppl. Fig.
5b). Senescence was also suppressed in tumours formed by SCC13 cells with p53
knockdown (Suppl. Fig. 4b,c).
Ras induced senescence of cultured cells was also counteracted by CsA or VIVIT treatment
and p53 knockdown (Suppl. Fig. 7a–c). Induction of terminal differentiation markers was
similarly suppressed (Suppl. Fig. 7d). Paralleling these changes and consistent with previous
reports15, oncogenic ras expression caused increased p53 protein levels, without effects on

transcription (Suppl. Fig. 7e). Importantly, calcineurin/NFAT inhibition counteracted the ras
effects suppressing p53 expression not only at the protein but also mRNA level (Suppl. Fig.
7e).

Author Manuscript

In HKCs and SCC cells, p53 gene transcription is under negative control of the AP-1
complex, specifically c-Jun and c-Fos10. Real time RT-PCR and immunoblotting showed
that c-Jun and c-Fos levels were unaffected by CsA or VIVIT treatment of HKCs. By
contrast, expression of ATF3, a member of the “enlarged” AP-1 family previously
connected with SCC progression18, was sharply up-regulated (Fig. 2a, Suppl. Fig. 8a). ATF3
expression also increased after Calcineurin B1 or NFATc1 knockdown (Fig. 2b; Suppl. Fig.
8b,c), and in SCC13 cells treated with CsA or VIVIT (Suppl. Fig. 8d). Enhanced ATF3
expression in CsA- or VIVIT-treated keratinocytes was paralleled by increased binding of
the ATF3 protein to specific oligonucleotide sequences of the p53 promoter containing
intact, but not mutated, ATF3 binding sites (Suppl. Fig. 8e). Increased ATF3 expression in
CsA-treated keratinocytes was suppressed by retrovirally expressed constitutively active
NFATc119 (Fig. 2c, Suppl. Fig. 8f). The kinetics of NFATc1 knockdown and ATF3 upregulation were highly correlated (Suppl. Fig. 8g), and induction of ATF3 by CsA or VIVIT
occurred to similar or greater extent when protein synthesis was inhibited (Fig. 2d).
Consistent with ATF3 being a direct target, chromatin immunoprecipitation assays showed
binding of endogenous NFATc1 to two distinct regions of the ATF3 promoter harboring
NFAT binding sites, such binding being abolished by NFATc1 knockdown or CsA
treatment (Fig. 2e, left panel). In intact human epidermis, we also detected NFATc1 binding
to the ATF3 promoter comparable to a well established NFATc1 target, the calcipressin
gene (RCNA1)20 (Fig. 2e, right panel).

Author Manuscript

CsA treatment caused ATF3 up-regulation and p53 down-modulation also in human skin
explants and tumour xenografts (Suppl. Fig. 8h,i). Increased ATF3 and decreased p53
expression was also observed in SCCs from CsA-treated patients versus untreated patients,
together with decreased senescence (Fig. 2f, Suppl. Fig. 9). Increased ATF3 expression in
SCCs from CsA-treated patients was further confirmed by tissue array/
immunohistochemical analysis of a cohort of tumour biopsies (Fig. 2g). Nucleotide
sequence analysis of p53 in 5 SCCs from CsA-treated patients revealed missense mutations
affecting the DNA binding domain and/or polymorphisms associated with cancer
development (72 Pro/Arg substitution) similar to those in the general patient population
(www-p53.iarc.fr).

Author Manuscript

Functionally, ectopic ATF3 expression, at levels comparable to those occurring in SCCs
from CsA-treated patients (Fig. 2f), blocked expression of p53 and senescence-associated
genes (Fig. 3a,b). Conversely, ATF3 knockdown induced these genes, counteracting the
CsA and VIVIT effects (Fig. 3c,d, Suppl. Fig. 10). In vivo, ectopic ATF3 promoted
tumourigenicity of H-rasV12-expressing HKCs and SCC cells, produced aggressive tumours
with reduced senescence as those caused by calcineurin/NFAT inhibitors (Fig. 3e,f; Suppl.
Fig. 11a,b,e). Conversely, ATF3 knockdown overcame the tumour promoting effects of
these compounds and restored senescence (Fig. 3g,h; Suppl. Fig. 11c,d).

Senescence serves to restrict tumourigenic potential of cells15. To test whether calcineurin
inhibition exerts opposite effects, H-rasV12-expressing HKCs were sorted for elevated
integrin α6 and low CD71 levels (α6bri CD71dim cells), enriching for cells with high self
renewal potential21. In culture, response of α6bri CD71dim cells to VIVIT and CsA
treatment, in term of ATF3 and p53 levels, was similar to that of total unsorted populations
(data not shown). To assess their in vivo behaviour, H-rasV12-expressing α6bri CD71dim
cells were injected in serial dilutions, together with constant amount of normal HKCs, into
NOD/SCID interleukin-2 receptor gamma chain null (Il2rg(−/−)) mice22. Addition of
matrigel allowed retention of injected cells in well identifiable “nodules”. Histological
analysis of nodules from control mice at 1 month after injection showed that H-rasV12expressing HKCs injected in low number formed only a few keratinized cysts with limited
cellularity. By contrast, in nodules recovered from CsA-treated mice there was a striking
number of “proliferative centers”, composed of keratinocytes with elevated Ki67 positivity
(Fig. 4a,b; Suppl. Fig. 12). When injected in higher number, H-rasV12-expressing HKCs
formed highly keratinized and poorly proliferative cysts in control mice, while in CsAtreated animals they gave rise to overt tumours (Fig. 4c). Similar results were obtained with
sorted H-rasV12- and ATF3- expressing HKCs versus controls (Fig. 4b,c).

Author Manuscript

Established cancer cell lines, including SCC cells, also contain distinct sub-populations with
different growth/tumourigenic potential23,24. SCC13 cells plus/minus increased ATF3
expression were sorted for elevated integrin α6 and low CD71 levels (cells) or for
expression of CD133, a cell surface marker of putative cancer stem cell populations,
including keratinocyte-derived24. Sorting resulted in >20 fold enrichment of tumourigenic
cells. As few as 500 sorted SCC13 cells overexpressing ATF3 produced detectable tumours,
while larger numbers of control cells were required (Fig. 4d; Suppl. Fig. 13a).
Histologically, even the lowest number of ATF3-expressing cells produced highly cellular
tumours with poor differentiation, while control cells formed differentiated cystic lesions
(Fig. 4d,e, Suppl. Fig. 13a,b).
In further testing, as little as 1000 freshly dissociated cells from tumours formed by HrasV12-expressing HKCs in CsA-treated mice gave rise to secondary tumours, while
substantially higher cell numbers were required in control mice (Fig. 4f). Similar results
were obtained with H-rasV12-expressing HKCs or SCC13 cells plus/minus increased ATF3
expression (Fig. 4f,g). Histologically, secondary tumours formed in CsA-treated mice or by
ATF3-expressing cells were highly cellular and poorly differentiated, while those under
control conditions consisted, as the primary tumours, of differentiated cysts (Fig. 4f,g,
Suppl. Fig. 14).

Many regulatory pathways, including calcineurin/NFAT2–4,25, play both growth-promoting
and -suppressing functions, depending on cell type and context. An impact on tumour
growth has been recently attributed to calcineurin via indirect effects on angiogenesis26,27.
The intrinsic double negative genetic pathway that we have uncovered here is based on
calcineurin/NFAT suppression of ATF3, a negative regulator of p53. The resulting impact
on keratinocyte cancer cell senescence versus growth is of likely clinical significance for the
many patients under treatment with calcineurin inhibitors as immunosuppressants1, and may
be of relevance for other cancer types where altered calcium signalling plays a role28.

Methods summary
Multistep skin carcinogenesis assays were performed with mice with keratinocyte-specific
deletion of the CnB1 gene (CnB1loxP/loxPxK5-CrePR1)3 in parallel with Cre-negative
controls (CnB1loxP/loxP). Keratinocyte grafting assays were performed as previously
described29. Intradermal tumourigenicity assays were adapted from hair follicle
reconstitution assays30. Detailed conditions for these assays as well as chromatin
immunoprecipitation, immunoblotting, immunofluorescence, senescence β-galactosidase
staining, biotinylated DNA pull down assays, and sorting can be found in the Method

Suppl. Fig. 12a,b. d and e, sorted α6briCD71dim populations of SCC13 cells plus/minus
ATF3 overexpression were injected in the indicated numbers into Scid mice. Shown are
quantification of the results and representative histological images. Experimental conditions
were the same as with CD133 sorted cells (Suppl. Fig. 13). f and g, Cells dissociated from
tumours formed by Ha-rasV12-HKCs in mice plus/minus CsA treatment, or with ATF3
overexpression (f) or from tumours formed SCC13 cells plus/minus ATF3 overexpression
(g) were injected in decreasing numbers into secondary recipient mice (Scid), with tissue
retrieval 4 weeks later. For representative images and experimental conditions see Suppl.
