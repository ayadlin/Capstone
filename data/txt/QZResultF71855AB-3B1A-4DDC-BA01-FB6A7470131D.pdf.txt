ABSTRACT
Gastric cancer is the third leading cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide.
Chemotherapy is frequently used for gastric cancer treatment. Most patients with
advanced gastric cancer eventually succumb to the disease despite some patients
responded initially to chemotherapy. Thus, identifying molecular mechanisms
responsible for cancer relapse following chemotherapy will help design new ways to
treat gastric cancer. In this study, we revealed that the residual cancer cells following
treatment with chemotherapeutic reagent cisplatin have elevated expression of
hedgehog target genes GLI1, GLI2 and PTCH1, suggestive of hedgehog signaling
activation. We showed that GLI1 knockdown sensitized gastric cancer cells to CDDP
whereas ectopic GLI1 expression decreased the sensitivity. Further analyses indicate
elevated GLI1 expression is associated with an increase in tumor sphere formation,
side population and cell surface markers for putative cancer stem cells. We have
evidence to support that GLI1 is critical for maintenance of putative cancer stem
cells through direct regulation of ABCG2. In fact, GLI1 protein was shown to be
associated with the promoter fragment of ABCG2 through a Gli-binding consensus site
in gastric cancer cells. Disruption of ABCG2 function, through ectopic expression of
an ABCG2 dominant negative construct or a specific ABCG2 inhibitor, increased drug
sensitivity of cancer cells both in culture and in mice. The relevance of our studies to
gastric cancer patient care is reflected by our discovery that high ABCG2 expression
was associated with poor survival in the gastric cancer patients who underwent
chemotherapy. Taken together, we have identified a molecular mechanism by which
gastric cancer cells gain chemotherapy resistance.

respond to chemotherapy but cancer eventually relapses.
Therefore, chemotherapy resistance becomes a major barrier
to achieve effective gastric cancer treatment. Thus, finding
novel strategies to sensitize cancer cells to chemotherapy
will significantly improve gastric cancer patient survival.
Chemotherapy in gastric cancer is generally
used as multimodality treatment, such as perioperative
and adjuvant chemotherapy [7, 8]. The common
chemotherapeutical agents for gastric cancer include
cisplatin (CDDP), 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) or its oral

INTRODUCTION
Although gastric cancer is the third leading cause
of cancer-related death worldwide [1–4], our basic
understanding of gastric cancer falls behind that of many
other cancer types. Clinically, gastric cancer is treated by
surgical resection with chemotherapeutic interventions as
major options [5]. Even with an increased enrollment rate for
chemotherapy of gastric cancer, the overall median survival
remains between 15 to 17 months [6]. Patients initially

combinations include ECF (epirubixin, cisplatin and
5-FU), 5-FU plus either cisplatin or docetaxel (or
irinotecan) with radiation [9, 10]. The mechanisms
underlying chemoresistance in gastric cancer are not
entirely known, but the following mechanisms have been
reported: decreased intracellular drug accumulation and/
or increased drug efflux, increased nucleotide excisionrepair activity, evasion of apoptosis, activation of several
signaling pathways and the existence of putative cancer
stem cells. Another theory for chemosensitivity is the
cancer stem cell hypothesis: a small percentage of cancer
cells, the residual cancer cells or the putative cancer stem
cells, are resistant to chemotherapy-mediated cell killing,
and become the source for cancer relapse. If the regulatory
mechanisms for maintaining this cell population are
discovered, agents disrupting the mechanisms may be used
to develop novel strategies to treat gastric cancer.
There are a number of signaling pathways involved
in regulation of drug resistance, including the hedgehog
pathway [11–15]. Hedgehog signaling is an important
pathway for embryonic development, tissue patterning, cell
differentiation, cancer development and drug resistance
[16–18]. In the last few years, hedgehog signaling is
reported in regulation of drug resistance in several types
of cancer including ovarian, prostate and pancreatic cancer
[11, 15, 19–21]. In hedgehog signaling active cells, the
hedgehog ligands (Shh, Ihh or Dhh) bind to PTCH1,
allowing smoothened to signal to the downstream GLI
transcription factors, which then turn on the target genes
[18]. Target genes of hedgehog signaling include GLI1,
PTCH1 as well as other molecules involved in regulation
of cancer cell function, such as ABCG2 [22]. ABCG2 is an
important transportor and functions in maintenance of the
stem cell population through side population regulation.
In this study, we report a novel mechanism underlying
drug resistance in gastric cancer. We found that treatment of
gastric cancer cells with the chemotherapeutical drug CDDP
often results in elevated hedgehog (Hh) signaling which is
associated with an increase in putative cancer stem cell
markers. We further investigated the functional significance
of Hh signaling and ABCG2 in cultured cells and in mouse
models. The relevance of our findings to gastric cancer
patients was further examined in human specimens.
These findings may lead to novel strategies to improve the
effectiveness of chemotherapy in gastric cancer.

cell lines N87 and AGS were used in our initial studies. We
predicted that the residual cells with intrinsic drug resistance
to chemotherapy will survive following drug treatment, and
the responsible genes will be up-regulated. As a first step,
we measured the IC50 of CDDP in gastric cell lines from the
inhibition rate of cell viability by different concentrations of
CDDP (Figure 1A and 1B). We then treated cells with CDDP
at the IC50 dose for 48 hr and examined the candidate gene
expression. Previous studies indicate many candidate genes
involved in regulation of residual cancer cells or putative
cancer stem cells, such as Hh, Wnt and Notch signaling
molecules [26–28]. As shown in Figure 1C, we found that
target genes for the Hh signaling pathway, GLI1, GLI2 and
PTCH1, were significantly induced in CDDP-treated N87
cells. Similar results were also obtained from AGS cells
(Figure 1D). In contrast, we did not observe significant gene
expression changes in DKK1, JAG2 or CTGF, molecules
involved in Wnt, Notch and Hippo/YAP signaling (Figure
1C and 1D, Supplementary Figure 1).
Like Wnt and Notch signaling, Hh signaling plays
an important role in embryonic development, and is also
critical for maintenance of putative cancer stem cells
or residual cancer cells [26, 29, 30]. We thus examined
expression of several putative cancer stem cell markers
[31–38] following CDDP treatment in N87 cells.
There are a number of factors involved in regulation of
putative cancer stem cells [39–43]. For example, the side
population is often enriched in stem cells and cancer
stem cells, and ABCG2 is the major gene regulating side
population [44]. Sox2 is another important factor involved
in regulation of putative cancer stem cells [45]. Through
real-time PCR analysis, we found high expression of
ABCG2 following drug treatment (Figure 1C). This
phenomenon did not appear to be cell line specific because
similar results were also observed in AGS cells (Figure
1D). In contrast, SOX2 expression was not significantly
changed (Figure 1C and 1D).
These results indicate that elevated Hh signaling
may be responsible for maintenance of residual cancer
cells (or putative cancer stem cells or tumor initiating
cells) following chemotherapeutic drug treatment in
gastric cancer.

Significance of GLI1 expression for intrinsic
drug resistance in gastric cancer cells
To evaluate the functional relevance of Hh signaling
for the intrinsic drug resistance in N87 and AGS cells, we
first knocked down GLI1 expression by expressing GLI1
shRNAs in both cell lines, and then determined the IC50
for CDDP. We found that down-regulation of GLI1 in
N87 cells (Figure 2A) reduced the IC50 by nearly half
(Figure 2B). The IC50 value was also reduced by GLI1
knockdown in AGS cells (Figure 2C and 2D). Additional
experiments in IC50 measurement and tumor sphere
formation indicate that knocking down both GLI1 and GLI2
has similar effect as GLI1 knockdown (Supplementary

tumor sphere formation), suggesting that the feed-forward
loop exerted by GLI1 is the major factor for regulation of
putative cancer stem cells. Thus, GLI1, the focus for the
rest of our study, appears to be critical for drug resistance
in gastric cancer cells.
Furthermore, we determined whether elevated Hh
signaling is sufficient to drive drug resistance in gastric

cancer cells by ectopic expression of GLI1 in N87 and
AGS cells, and examining their IC50 values for CDDP.
We discovered that ectopic GLI1 expression in both N87
and AGS cells significantly increased the IC50 value
(Figure 2E-2H).
Taken together, we found that the GLI1 expression
level is highly associated with chemosensitivity in gastric
cancer cells. While down-regulation of GLI1 decreases

cancer stem cell maintenance, we detected the putative
cancer stem cell population in gastric cancer cells using
three methods.
First, we measured tumor sphere forming efficiency
from N87 cells with GLI1 shRNAs, ectopic GLI1
expression or the control cells. Tumor sphere formation
efficiency is a known biological readout of cancer stem
cells [46]. We found that GLI1 knockdown significantly
reduced the size of tumor spheres (Figure 3A). GLI1
shRNA expression also reduced the tumor sphere forming
efficiency (Figure 3A, with the control ~38 spheres /2000
cells and Gli1 knockdown cells 29 spheres/ 2000 cells, P =
0.032). Conversely, ectopic expression of GLI1 increased

the IC50, ectopic expression of GLI1 increases the
CDDP IC50.

Regulation of the putative cancer stem cell
population by GLI1
Previous studies have revealed heterogeneous cell
populations even within the established cell lines [31–38],
and our experiments with CDDP treatment studies also
suggest that a subset of cells (e.g. putative cancer stem
cells) are more resistant to drug treatment, and that GLI1
may play an important role in maintenance of this cell
population. To directly test the role of GLI1 for putative

the tumor sphere forming efficiency (Figure 3C, with the
control ~32.5 spheres/2000 cells and GLI1 expressing
cells 80 spheres/ 2000 cells, P = 0.034). It thus appears
that high GLI1 expression increases the tumor sphere
forming efficiency.
Second, we also detected side population of cancer
cells after GLI1 alteration. Side population is a functional
assay for the transporter ABCG2, and is a well-known
readout for stem cells and putative cancer stem cells [47–
49]. We found that GLI1 shRNA reduced the side population
by 40% (Figure 3B) whereas ectopic GLI1 expression
increased the side population by 100% (Figure 3D).
Third, we also detected cell surface marker
expression following alteration of GLI1 levels. Since

there are no consensus cell surface markers for putative
cancer stem cells in gastric cancer, we examined changes
in the following markers: CD24, CD33, CD44, CD90
and CD133 that are reported in the literature [31–38].
We did not see significant changes in CD24, CD44 and
CD33 in our experiments. However, we found that GLI1
knockdown significantly reduced expression of CD90
and CD133 (Supplementary Figure 4A/B) whereas
ectopic GLI1 expression increased expression of CD90
(Supplementary Figure 4C/D). Although CD44 was
reduced by GLI1 shRNAs and was reportedly regulated by
hedgehog signaling [50], the decrease in our experiments
did not reach statistical significance.

Taken all the data together, we concluded that GLI1
expression is an important factor for maintenance of the
putative cancer stem cell population as indicated by tumor
sphere forming efficiency and side population. While
GLI1 knocking down reduces the putative cancer stem
cell population, ectopic expression of GLI1 increases this
population.

After promoter analysis, we discovered a GLI1binding consensus site [18] in the promoter of ABCG2
(Supplementary Figure 5C), suggesting that ABCG2 may
be a transcriptional target of GLI1 molecules. We performed
ChIP analysis [51] following ectopic expression of GLI1
in N87 and AGS cells (Supplementary Figure 5A and
5B). Supplementary Figure 5C showed the 9 base pairs
sequence of the potential GLI1 binding site within the
ABCG2 promoter. Our data indicate that ectopically
expressed GLI1 protein (with MYC tag) can be pulled
down with the ABCG2 promoter region encompassing
the GLI1 binding site (Supplementary Figure 5D and
5E) whereas the control IgG does not pull down the
fragment. Similarly, MYC antibodies did not pull down
the fragment in cells without ectopic GLI1 expression.
These results suggest that GLI1 may directly regulate
ABCG2 expression by transcriptional regulation, which
is consistent with a previous report in lymphomas [52].
Next, we evaluated the functional relevance of
ABCG2 for regulating drug sensitivity. We used two

Because ABCG2 is responsible for exclusion of
Hoechst 33342 dye and the subsequent side population, we
tested whether GLI1 directly regulate ABCG2 expression.
Through real-time PCR analysis, we found that while
GLI1 shRNAs significantly reduced ABCG2 expression by
half, ectopic GLI1 expression induced ABCG2 transcript
by 100% (Figure 4A). Similarly, treatment with CDDP
increased expression of ABCG2 (Figure 1C and 1D) and
the side population (Figure 4B).

methods to reduce ABCG2 function. First, we used a
truncated form of ABCG2, which has a dominant negative
effect on the endogenous ABCG2 gene function [53], and
found that ectopic expression of this truncated form of
ABCG2 reduced the IC50 of CDDP by half (Figure 5A),
which was associated with reduced side population (Figure
5B and Supplementary Figure 6A) and a decrease in CD90
expression (Supplementary Figure 6B). Similarly, when
an ABCG2 inhibitor FTC [54] was used, we observed
a significant reduction in the IC50 (Figure 5C), sphere
formation (Figure 5D) and side population (Figure 5E,
Supplementary Figure 6C). Conversely, we found that
overexpression of ABCG2 increased the IC50 for CDDP
(Figure 6A), which was associated with an increase in
side population (Figure 6B), sphere formation (Figure
6C and Supplementary Figure 6D) and CD90 expression
(Supplementary Figure 6E).
The effect of ectopic ABCG2 expression on the
IC50 of CDDP was very similar to that GLI1 expression,
suggesting that ABCG2 may be the major mediator for
regulating drug sensitivity in gastric cancer. In consistent
with our hypothesis, ectopic expression of ABCG2 had

no significant effects on expression of GLI1, GLI2 and
PTCH1 in both N87 and AGS cells (Supplementary Figure
7), further confirming that hedgehog signaling is upstream
of ABCG2 in our experiment system.

Therapeutic effects of CDDP in ectopic
expression of GLI1 xenograft model
To determine the relevance of our in vitro studies
to therapeutic implication, we tested the effects of CDDP
on the subcutaneous mouse model using N87 cells with
alterations in GLI1 and ABCG2. GLI1 was ectopically
expressed in N87/pLNCX/GLI1 cells while GLI1
expression was knocked down in N87/shGLI1 cells. A
truncated form of ABCG2 was expressed in N87/pBabe/
TM5-6 cells. As shown in Figure 7A and 7B, CDDP
treatment reduced the tumor significantly in the N87
control group. In contrast, ectopic GLI1 expression in N87
cells did not respond to CDDP treatment whereas GLI1
shRNA expression sensitized tumors to CDDP treatment.
Blockage of ABCG2 function, via ectopic expression of a
dominant negative construct ABCG2/TM5-6, made N87

gastric cancer cells more sensitive to CDDP treatment
(Figure 7B). Tumors formed from the cells expressing
shGLI1 or TM5-6 reduced the tumor size significantly
following CDDP treatment (Figure 7D and 7E). In
contrast, tumors formed from the cells with ectopic GLI1
expression were not significantly affected by CDDP (in
compared with the N87 control group, Figure 7C). These
results are consistent with the in vitro studies, further
confirming that the levels of GLI1 and ABCG2 expression
determine the sensitivity of gastric cancer cells to CDDP
treatment.

(Figure 8A). We found that positivity of ABCG2 staining
was significantly correlated with clinicopathological
parameters. As shown in Table 1, the presence of ABCG2
was higher in poorly differentiated gastric cancer
specimens in comparison with well-differentiated ones
(Figure 8B, P = 0.0005). There was no difference in the
correlation between ABCG2 expression and gender, age,
tumor size and tumor location (see Table 1 for details).
Among these 180 gastric cancer patients, 170 cases were
available with the follow-up information. As Figure 8C
shown, higher ABCG2 expression in gastric cancer was
correlated with a shorter overall survival, indicating that
high ABCG2 expression in the tumor predicts a poor
outcome in chemotherapy in gastric cancer patients.
Because there are no GLI1 antibodies suitable for
immunohistochemistry in paraffin-embedded tissues,
we took the advantage of the CTGA data to test whether
higher GLI1 transcript level is correlated with cancer
relapse or patient survival in those patients who underwent
chemotherapy. In a cohort of 415 cancer specimens, we
found that 7 out of 12 (>50%) patients with high GLI1
transcript had relapsed cancer whereas 102 out of 310
patients with low GLI1 expression had relapsed cancer.
In addition, patients with high Gli1 expression had worse

Higher ABCG2 expression in gastric cancer
patients with poor prognosis
We went further to find the relevance of our data to
gastric cancer patients by correlating ABCG2 expression
in the tumor with the survival of patients who underwent
chemotherapy using CDDP. The expression level of
ABCG2 was analyzed by immunohistochemistry in
180 cases of gastric cancer patients who underwent
chemotherapy. According to our criteria (see Materials
and Methods), 62% (111/180) of gastric cancer specimens
were positively stained with anti-ABCG2 antibodies

disease-free survival (Supplementary Figure 9). These
results suggest that the GLI1-ABCG2 signaling axis is
associated with poor outcomes of the gastric cancer patients.
From all these data, we conclude that activation
of Hh signaling, through regulation of ABCG2, plays
an important role in regulation of drug sensitivity in
gastric cancer. We predict that the novel strategies aimed
at reducing GLI1 expression or interrupting ABCG2
function, together with CDDP-based chemotherapy,
should improve the survival of gastric cancer patients.

very low (< 5%) [1]. Although the regulatory mechanisms
for chemotherapy resistance in gastric cancer have been
reported in the last 10 years [55], very little data have been
linked the mechanisms to patient survival. Our results
indicate that the GLI1-mediated regulation of ABCG2
is an important mechanism responsible for maintenance
of the residual cancer cells (or putative cancer stem
cells) in gastric cancer following treatment with CDDP,
a major chemotherapeutical drug. We have data to show
that knocking down GLI1 (Figure 2 and Figure 3) or
inhibiting ABCG2 functions (Figure 5), sensitizes cancer
cells to chemotherapy in cultured cells (Figure 2-6) and in
mice (Figure 7). More importantly, we have shown that
higher GLI1/ ABCG2 expression is associated with poor
survival of gastric cancer patients who underwent CDDPbased chemotherapy (Figure 8 and Supplementary Figure

9). Since inhibitors for GLI1 and ABCG2 are already
available, we predict that these agents, together with
CDDP-based chemotherapy, will improve gastric cancer
patient survival.
Like Wnt and Notch signaling pathways, Hh
signaling is known to be a critical regulator for embryonic
development, and is involved in maintenance of the cancer
cell stemness in a number of cancer types [18, 26, 29, 30,
56]. There are several reports on association of Hh signaling
with drug resistance [13, 56, 57], but the molecular link is
often not known. Yoon et al reported a link between Hh
signaling and CD44 expression in a number of cell lines
through sphere formation studies, which was shown to be
associated with cisplatin resistance in gastric cancer [50].
While we have confirmed regulation of CD44 by GLI1
expression, we found that GLI1 affects ABCG2 more

dramatically, with little effects on CD44 (Supplementary
Figure 4). Furthermore, we demonstrated that inhibition
of ABCG2 by expressing a truncated ABCG2 molecule or
addition of a specific inhibitor, sensitizes cancer cells to
CDDP treatment (Figure 5). We found that the ligands, Shh
and Ihh, were not significantly altered by CDDP in N87 and
AGS cells (Supplementary Figure 8), suggesting that upregulation of GLI1 in these cells was not caused by liganddependent signaling. This implies that the SMO inhibitors,
with two already approved by FDA for basal cell carcinoma
treatment [58], will not be effective in sensitizing gastric
cancer cells to chemotherapy. It will be interesting, though, to
reveal the molecule mechanisms by which GLI1 expression
is induced in cancer cells with intrinsic tolerance of CDDP,
which may provide additional strategies to sensitize gastric
cancer cells to chemotherapy. Targeting ABCG2 will be a

more feasible strategy to improve the sensitivity of gastric
cancer cells to chemotherapy. Although ABCG2 is known
to be responsible for transporting several types of small
molecules, such as ions, dyes and some chemotherapeutical
drugs, CDDP transport in and out of cells is not affected by
ABCG2 [59, 60], further confirming that ABCG2 expression
may represent a subset of cell population (side population)
with cancer cell stemness.

cells were maintained in RPMI-1640, while HEK293T
cells were cultured in DMEM, supplemented with 10%
FBS, 100 U/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin at
37°C in a humidified environment containing 5% CO2.
Exponentially growing cells were used for experiments.

Cell viability and chemosensitivity assay
Cells (2000/well for AGS, 4000/well for N87) were
seeded into 96-well plates and stained at the indicated
time point using alamarBlue (Thermo scientific, FL,
USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The
optical density measured at 530/590 nm was used as an
indicator of cell viability. For chemosensitivity assay, the
medium was replaced by fresh medium with or without

CA, USA) (5, 10, 25, 50, 100 μM). Cell viability assay
was performed after 48 hrs of treatment [61–63]. Six
wells were counted for each drug concentration and at
least three independent experiments were performed.
The half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) value
was defined as the concentration that resulted in a 50%
reduction in cell growth compared with growth of the

(diluted at 1:10000, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa
Cruz, CA, USA) and goat anti-rabbit-HRP/goat antimouse-HRP (diluted at 1:10000, Thermo scientific)].
Detection was performed with ECL Western blotting
detection kit (Thermo scientific) as described previously
[64, 66].

Flow cytometry analyses

Plasmids construction, lentiviral and retroviral
infection

Single cells were dissociated using Accutase®
(Gibco, CA, USA) and re-suspended in PBS containing
10% FBS. The cells were incubated with fluorescenceconjugated antibody against human CD24, CD33,
CD44, CD90, CD133 and ABCG2 (all from Biolegend,
CA, USA) for 30min at 4°C. After washing, cells were
analyzed on FACSCalibur or FACSCanto II (Beckton
Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA) [66].
For side population assay, single cells were resuspended at 1 × 106/ml in DMEM with 2% FBS and
10 mM HEPES, stained with Hoechst 33342 dye (final
concentration 5 μg/ml, Invitrogen) and incubated at
37°C for 90 min with shaking. The cells were washed
with ice-cold HBSS with 2% FBS and 10 mM HEPES,
spined down at 4°C and re-suspended in ice-cold HBSS
containing 2 μg/ml propidium iodide (PI, Invitrogen). An
aliquot of cells was used as a negative control by adding
ABC transporter inhibitor fumitremorgin C (FTC, 10 μM,
Calbiochem) and incubated at 37°C for 30 min before
addition of Hoechst 33342.

The plasmid pLNCX/GLI1 (with a Myc tag) was
previously constructed in our laboratory [51] and pLKO.1/
shGLI1 and their corresponding control plasmid pLKO.1/
shCtrl were from the Broad Institute. Expression plasmid
pSIN4/ABCG2 was purchased from Addgene (#25983).
The ABCG2/TM5-6 plasmid was kindly provided by Dr.
Jian-ting Zhang at Indiana University School of Medicine,
and subcloned into pBabe using EcoRI and BamHI to
obtain pBabe/TM5-6 (with Myc tag) [53].
To generate GLI1 knockdown, ABCG2 and TM56 overexpression cells, AGS and N87 cells were infected
with lentivirus containing pLKO.1/shGLI1, pSIN4/
ABCG2 and pBabe/TM5-6, respectively. Lentiviral
packaging plasmids PRRE, RSV/REV and CMVG were
co-transfected into HEK293T cells using Lipofectamine
3000 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) for virus
production and infection as previously described [64].
Twenty-four hours after infection, cells were selected with
1 μg/ml puromycin (Sigma, St Louis, MO, USA) or 1 mg/
ml G418 (Invitrogen).

Sphere formation assay
Cells were re-suspended in sphere formation
medium (Neural Basal medium with 1× B-27, 20 ng/ml
of EGF, 10 ng/ml of βFGF and 5 μg/ml of heparin), and
plated on ultralow attachment 24-well plates with 2000
cells each well (Corning, Lowell, MA, USA) as described
previously [67]. Sphere formation medium was changed
every other day. After 7 days, spheres were counted and
taken photos, or cells were dissociated with Accutase®
and used for other experiments. The sphere forming
efficiency was calculated by counting the number of
spheres formed from 2000 cells.

Reverse transcriptase and real-time PCR
Total RNA was isolated from cells using TRIzol
reagent (Sigma) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. One microgram of total RNA was reverse
transcribed into cDNAs using the First-Strand Synthesis
Kit (Roche, Indianapolis, IN, USA). The abundance of
transcripts in the cDNA samples was measured by realtime PCR with specific probes as instructed from the
provider and previously described [65, 66]. All probes
for real-time PCR were purchased from the Applied
Biosystems.

Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay

Western blot analysis

ChIP was performed as previously described
[51]. In brief, cells at 80% confluence were cross-linked
with formaldehyde (Sigma) at room temperature for
15 min. Formaldehyde was neutralized by addition of
125 mM glycine for 5 min. The cells were collected by
centrifugation and rinsed in cold phosphate-buffered
saline. The cell pellets were collected by centrifugation
and then re-suspended in sonication buffer (1% SDS, 10
mM EDTA, 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.1, 0.5 mM PMSF,

Cells were lysed in cell lysis buffer (50 mM Hepes,
pH 7.4, 2 mM EDTA, 100 mM NaCl, 1% Glycerol, 1%
Triton X-100) containing protease and phosphatase
inhibitors. After separation by SDS-polyacrylamide
gel electrophoresis and protein transfer onto PVDF
membrane. Antibodies were used to incubate with the

and 100 ng of leupeptin and aprotinin/ml) and incubated
on ice for 20 min. The samples were sonicated on ice
with an Ultrasonics sonicator at setting 10 for 20-second
pulses to yield an average length of 500-1000 bp for
genomic DNA. The chromatin solution was pre-cleared
with the addition of protein A/G plus agarose beads
(from the Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc.) for 30 min
at 4°C. Prior to use, the protein A/G plus agarose beads
were blocked with sheared herring sperm DNA (1 μg/
μl) and bovine serum albumin (1 μg/μl) for at least 4 hr
at 4°C. 10% of the supernatant was saved as total input,
and the rest was immunoprecipitated with 5 μg of normal
anti-mouse IgG (Biolegend), 5 μg of Myc-tag mouse
monoclonal antibody (Cell signaling technology) or 5 μg
of anti-Histone H3 polyclonal antibody (Biolegend) at
4°C overnight, and then incubated with protein A/G plus
agarose beads for 1 hr. Immunoprecipitates were washed
twice in TE buffer (10 mM Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 1 mM EDTA,
1 mM PMSF), once with Low Salt Wash buffer (0.1%
SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mM EDTA, 20 mM Tris-Cl, pH
8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM PMSF), twice with High Salt
Wash buffer (0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mM EDTA,
20 mM Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 500 mM NaCl, 1 mM PMSF),
once with LiCl Wash buffer (0.25 M LiCl, 1% NP-40,
1% Sodium deoxycholate, 1 mM EDTA, 10 mM TrisCl, pH 8.0, 1 mM PMSF) and three times in TE buffer.
Immunoprecipitates were eluted in Elution buffer (50 mM
Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 10 mM EDTA, 1% SDS, 200 mM NaCl)
and incubated at 65°C for 30 min. DNA was purified by
extraction with phenol/chloroform and precipitated with
1/10 volume of 3 M NaOAc (pH 5.3) and 2.5 volumes of
ethanol. The DNA fragment was amplified by PCR using
primers flanking the promoter region 1000 bp upstream.
Primers used to PCR-amplify the ABCG2 gene chromatin
were 5’-ATCCCATTCACCAGAAACCA-3’ and 5’–
CGAACGGAATGAACCAGAGT-3’ resulting in a product
size of 205 bp. Primers used to PCR-amplify 18s as an
internal control were 5’-CAGCCACCCGAGATTGAGC-3’
and 5’-TAGTAGCGACGGGCGGTGTG-3’ resulting in a
product size of 252 bp.

removed, weighted and fixed in 10% buffered formalin for
further analysis.

Immunohistochemistry (IHC)
Two ninety-dot tissue arrays were purchased from
Shanghai Outdo Biotech Company (Shanghai, China).
Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded sections were
deparaffinized by xylene, rehydrated in ethanol and boiled
in 10 mM citrate buffer (pH 6.0) for 30 min for antigen
retrieval. Endogenous peroxidase was blocked by 3% H2O2
for 10 min for immunoperoxidase labeling. Sections were
then incubated at 4°C overnight with primary antibodies
against rabbit anti-ABCG2 (1:100, Abcam, Cambridge,
UK). Incubation with corresponding secondary antibody
(ImmPRESS universal peroxidase reagent, Vector Lab,
CA, USA) and the peroxidase-antoperoxidase complex
was visualized by DAB kit (ImmPACT DAB Peroxidase
Substrate, Vector Lab), as previously described [68]. Two
individuals (B.Y. and J.X.), who had no prior knowledge
of the clinical pathologic data of the patients, examined
the stained sections independently. Positive membrane
ABCG2 staining was assessed by the intensity of stained
cells and determined in two categories (negative and
positive). The staining intensity was classified from 0 to
3+ as follows: 0, no staining; 1+, < 25% of the section was
stained; 2+, 26% - 50% of the section was stained; 3+, >
50% of the section was stained. Scores of 1+, 2+ and 3+
were considered to be positive.

Statistical analysis
Data are presented as mean ± SD. from at least three
independent experiments. IC50 values of CDDP were
calculated with the GraphPad Prism software. Survival
data were analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method with a
log-rank test for comparison of survival curves. Statistical
comparisons between two groups were performed using a
two-tail unpaired t-test or the chi-square test, with P values
of < 0.05 indicating statistically significant difference.
