ABSTRACT
Vitamin D receptor (VDR) is a member of the nuclear receptor (NR) superfamily
of ligand-activated transcription factors. Activated VDR is responsible for maintaining
calcium and phosphate homeostasis, and is required for proper cellular growth,
cell differentiation and apoptosis. The expression of both phases I and II drugmetabolizing enzymes is also regulated by VDR, therefore it is clinically important.
Post-translational modifications of NRs have been known as an important
mechanism modulating the activity of NRs and their ability to drive the expression
of target genes. The aim of this mini review is to summarize the current knowledge
about post-transcriptional and post-translational modifications of VDR.

INTRODUCTION

only three isoforms (two are made by alternative splicing,
one by polymorphism in translation initiation codon) of
VDR were discovered in human cells or cell lines (Figure
1B). The most emerging form is VDRA consisting of 427
amino acids (48 kDa). Second isoform, called VDRB1,
is elongated on N-terminal domain about 50 amino
acids (477 amino acids; 54 kDa) by start site (ATG) in
exon 1d (VDRA has start site in exon 2) and was found
in human kidney, intestinal and kidney epithelial cell
lines [5, 8]. This elongation enables different reaction to
ligands (calcitriol or lithocholic acid) in diverse types of
tissue, suggesting that VDRA and VDRB1 activation is
ligand- and tissue-specific [9, 10]. Third isoform forms
due to the FokI polymorphism of VDR. FokI (defined by
the restriction enzyme) is present at translation initiation
codon and results in a formation of shorter VDR that has
higher transcriptional activity than full length VDR [11].
Vitamin D receptor is activated by calcitriol,
formation of which is initiated in the skin. UV-B radiation
converts 7-dehydrocholesterol into previtamin D3, which
is quickly transformed into vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol,
it can be taken from diet). Another dietary available
form, vitamin D2 (ergocalciferol), then follows the same
metabolic fate as vitamin D3. Vitamin D (D represents
D2 or D3) is hydroxylated on position 25 by microsomal
P450 enzymes (CYP27A1, CYP2R1, CYP2J2, CYP2J3
and CYP3A4) to 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D]

The vitamin D receptor (VDR; NR1I1) was
discovered in 1969 as a protein activated by the hormonal
form of cholecalciferol 1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3
(1,25(OH)2D3 or calcitriol) [1]. Today it is known that the
VDR is a member of the superfamily of nuclear steroid/
thyroid hormone receptors present in the cytoplasm and
nucleus. Earlier observations describing VDR as a receptor
with predominant nuclear localization were disproved by
using a fluorescently labeled ligand [2] and this was later
confirmed by confocal microscopy [3]. Following ligand
binding, the VDR forms a heterodimer with retinoid X
receptor (RXR; NR2B1) and regulates the expression
of genes via binding to vitamin D responsive element
(VDRE; short nucleotide sequence with direct, everted or
inverted repeats) found in their regulatory regions. Vitamin
D receptor gene is located on chromosome 12. The precise
physical localization in the centromeric region 12cen-q12
was confirmed by fluorescent in situ hybridization in 1999
[4].
The gene consists of 14 exons of approximately
100 kb and can be divided into two main regions (Figure
1A). The first exon is located in the promotor region and
has six variants (a - f) important for alternative splicing
of VDR. Exons 2 - 9 present in the coding region are
common for all 14 known transcripts [5-7]. To this date,

mostly in human liver. Due to the stability in blood and
a long circulating half-life lasting 2 weeks, 25(OH)D is
widely accepted as an indicator of vitamin D status [12].
Normal physiological level (vitamin D sufficiency) is
defined as 25(OH)D > 30 ng/ml (75 nmol/L) and vitamin
D deficiency as 25(OH)D < 20 ng/ml (50 nmol/L) [12].
25(OH)D is biologically inactive and must be converted
in the kidneys by 25(OH)D-1α-hydroxylase (CYP27B1)
into 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D [1,25(OH)2D], active form
of vitamin D. The overall schema of synthesis is clearly
and representatively presented in other papers [13, 14].
Regarding the dietary sources of vitamin D (D2 or D3),
older study demonstrated 1.7-times greater efficacy for
vitamin D3 then vitamin D2 in maintaining the 25(OH)D
status [15]. However, recent research brought the proof
that vitamin D2 is equally effective [16]. Moreover,
binding affinities of 1,25(OH)2D2 (ergocalcitriol) or
1,25(OH)2D3 (calcitriol) to VDR or transactivation
potencies on target genes are almost comparable [17, 18].
VDR is involved in bone and calcium homeostasis,
cell differentiation, immunomodulation and control
of other hormonal systems [19]. The role of VDR in
immunity was reported in many clinical studies. High
doses of vitamin D helped to prevent illness caused
by influenza [20, 21] or other respiration infections

[22]. There are also evidences suggesting that vitamin
D supplementation can increase the effects of antituberculosis cure. Indeed, 1,25(OH)2D enhances innate
immunity by increasing the expression of antimicrobial
peptides including cathelicidin, a peptide involved in
elimination of Mycobacterium tuberculosis [23, 24].
Moreover, VDR positively stimulates the expression of
gene for phospholipase C-γ1 (PLC- γ1) in naive human
T-cells. This gene plays a key role in classical T-cell
antigen receptor signaling and T-cell activation [25].
The importance of vitamin D was demonstrated even
on muscle strength predominantly in the elderly people
[26] or femoral whole-bone strength in older men [27].
Furthermore, it has been shown that 1,25(OH)2D has
anticancer effect against prostate [28, 29] and breast
cancers [28, 30].
As in many other genes, there were described
polymorphisms in the promotor and coding gene regions
of VDR as well. For instance, Fang et al. found haplotype
alleles in promotor region and in the 3´-untranslated
region (3´-UTR), which are strongly associated with an
increased risk of bone fracture being independent on age,
sex, height, weight or bone mineral density of subjects
[31]. Recently, it was reported the relationship between
FokI polymorphism of VDR and susceptibility to chronic

14 exons, six of them being variants of exon 1, which participates on alternative splicing. Exons 2-9 are common to all known VDR protein
isoforms. B. Schematic demonstration of VDR protein composition. Most common variant of VDR is called VDRA. It consists of exons 2-9
and has 427 amino acids (AA). VDRB1 variant is elongated on N-terminal domain by two exons (1d and 1c) and has 477 AA. Truncated

periodontitis [32], AIDS disease [33] or more active
immune system for the shorter FokI-VDR variant [34].
A separate chapter is a role of VDR in cancer.
On the one hand, it was demonstrated that vitamin D
supplementation possess anti-cancer activity in mouse
xenografts of breast and prostate cancer [28] and that
epidermal growth factor receptor mutant lung cancer
is a vitamin D-responsive disease [35]. In addition,
epidemiological studies usually find inverse relationship
of vitamin D status and risk of breast cancer. However, in
general, the results are often conflicting, which is expected
to be due to the differences in methods for selecting cases
and controls, dietary intake data collection tools and
referent time period [36]. On the other hand, recent metaanalysis found an association between FokI polymorphism
and the susceptibility to prostate cancer in Caucasian
population [37]. Thus, VDR status can be a double-edge
sword in relation to cancer.
However, the different effects of VDR action in
diverse types of tissues cannot be explained just by
polymorphisms of VDR, splicing variants or tissue
specific environment. Thus, post-transcriptional and posttranslational modifications (PTMs) of VDR can represent
another level of VDR activity regulation.

11q24.1 and 21q11.2 [40]. It was demonstrated, that region
11q23-24 is frequently deleted in breast, lung and ovarian
cancers [41, 42] and the chromosomal region 21q11-21 in
breast, esophagus, ovary, lung and stomach cancers [43].
Mature miR-125b binds to miR-125b recognition
element (MRE 125b; highly conserved sequence found
among species) in target mRNAs and regulates their
amounts or attenuates translation without implication on
mRNA. MRE125b is located in the 3´-UTR in human
VDR site from +1786 to +1813 (Figure 2) with the
core sequence of CUCAGGG (essential sequence for
the binding of the miR-125b to the mRNA) [40]. Mohri
et al. demonstrated a negative influence of miR-125b
overexpression on VDR protein level (40 % reduction of
protein in contrast to untreated cells), with no effect on
VDR mRNA level. Vice versa, after reduction of miR125b, VDR protein level was increased by 130%, but still
without any effect on mRNA level [40]. This increase of
VDR may result in the augmentation of the antitumor
effect of calcitriol in cancers mentioned above.
However, it is an interesting fact that this miRNA
targets the mRNA of CYP24, a VDR-regulated gene
responsible for metabolic degradation of 1,25(OH)2D. In
the study by Komagata et al., it was found that increased
expression of miR-125b resulted in the decreased CYP24
protein and CYP24-mediated enzymatic activity [44].
Thus, possible effect of CYP24 inhibition and calcitriol
treatment in case of breast cancer patients may bring
synergistic benefits.
Another miRNA with a direct effect on the VDR is
miR-27b. Increased level of miR-27b (with transfected
miR-27b mimic) resulted in the lower level of VDR
protein (miR-27b targets 3´-UTR of VDR) (Figure 2), with
no effect on mRNA of VDR in human lung fibroblasts
(MRC-5) cells [45]. Reduced level of miR-27b (with miR27b inhibitor) caused opposing effects, but still without
any change in VDR mRNA level. Moreover, by employing
luciferase reporter assay it was demonstrated that miR-27b
directly targets 3´-UTR of VDR [45].

POST-TRANSCRIPTIONAL
REGULATION OF VDR BY MIRNA
MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of short (about 22
nucleotides) non-coding RNAs with wide gene regulatory
activity, which causes complementary mRNA degradation
or translation repression via binding to the 3´-UTR of
mRNA [38]. They are necessary for ensuring fundamental
processes in the human body and their deregulation has
been associated with several diseases, including cancer
[39].
The first investigated miRNA regulating VDR is the
mature miR-125b produced from two precursors (miR125-b1 and miR-125-b2) localized in chromosome regions

Figure 2: Schematic representation of human VDR mRNA with miRNAs binding sites at 3´-UTR. Both miRNAs bind to
3´-UTR, which results in the decreased VDR protein.

POST-TRANSLATIONAL
MODIFICATIONS (PTMS) OF VDR

Furthermore, the influence of VDR on protein Dicer
essential for the maturation of pre-miRNA to miRNA
is also worth mentioning. The VDRE was found in the
promoter region of Dicer gene. Upon binding of VDR/
RXR to VDRE, the amount of Dicer was increased on both
levels, mRNA and protein. However, upregulation of Dicer
was observed only at high concentration of 1,25(OH)2D (1
mM) [46]. Among the most affected miRNAs were miR22 (miR-22 regulates telomerase necessary for many types
of cancer), miR-296-3p and miR-498. All three miRNAs
are involved in anticancer actions and were upregulated
[46]. Nevertheless, this finding has probably no serious
implication in clinical practice since serum 25(OH)
D levels above 150 ng/mL are considered as vitamin D
intoxication [47]. Moreover, due to the tight control of
1,25(OH)2D formation, serum levels similar to that used
in the study mentioned [46] are not reachable.

Phosphorylation
Phosphorylation is the addition of phosphoryl
group (PO32-) to a molecule (in our case to VDR).
It plays a significant role in proteins regulation by
altering their function and activity. The first enzymatic
phosphorylation of proteins was described in 1953 by
Burnett and Kennedy, who used radioactively labeled
ATP (adenosine triphosphate) to demonstrate a new
type of enzymatic action [48]. Several members of the
steroid/thyroid hormone receptor superfamily are known
to be phosphorylated, including glucocorticoid receptor
[49], estrogen receptor [50] or thyroid hormone receptor
[51], and VDR is not an exception. The first evidence of
phosphorylated VDR came in 1985. It was demonstrated
that 1,25(OH)2D stimulated the phosphorylation of
VDR in mouse fibroblast 3T6 cells [52] and the same
mechanism was observed for chicken VDR [53].
Several years later, it was discovered that serine at

Figure 3: Full length VDR protein has five main parts essential for its function: DNA binding domain allows DNA
binding; nuclear localization signals direct the receptor into the nucleus; hormone/ligand-binding domain allows
ligand binding; dimerization domain is necessary for heterodimerization with RXR and transactivation domain
interacts with coactivators. Phosphorylation of S208 has direct influence on VDR heterodimerization, while phosphorylation of S51
attenuates transcription activity. Sumoylation of K91 and phosphorylation of S182 have negative effect on VDR transcription activity.
Phosphorylation of S222 has positive effect on VDR activity. There are indirect proofs that potential ubiquitination site on position K399
target VDR to degradation (* = indirect proof) and this effect is protected by calcitriol via suppression of so far unknown ubiquitin E3
ligase. CDK11p58 promotes VDR ubiquitination with subsequent repression of VDR activity and stability.

position 51 (in sequence RRS51MKRK located between
the two zinc fingers) in VDR is a substrate for protein
kinase C-β (PKC-β) (Figure 3) [54]. A point mutation
(serine to glycine; AGC to GGC) in this region led to
abolished PKC-β-catalyzed phosphorylation compared
with the phosphorylation in wild-type VDR (in vitro
and in vivo). Moreover, this amino acid change resulted
in the decreased transcriptional activity of the VDR
after 1,25(OH)2D treatment (10 nM for 48 h). This data
suggested positive role of phosphorylation at serine 51
in 1,25(OH)2D-dependent transcriptional activation of
VDR since de-phosphorylation, which can be equalized
to phospho-deficient mutation, resulted in the decrease of
VDR activity. Other tested serine residues (Ser119 and
Ser125 changed to glycine and alanine, respectively) were
not confirmed as phosphorylation sites of PKC-β [54].
Furthermore, the type of amino acid seems to be
very important as it was revealed by Hsieh et al. two years
later [55]. Replacement of serine with glycine (S51G),
aspartic acid (S51D, mimic negative charge) or threonine
(S51T) led to the decrease of transcription activity (by
65%, 90% and 55%, respectively) compared to the wild
type VDR in 1,25(OH)2D-treated cells [55], i.e. no matter
of phospho-deficient of -mimic mutation introduction.
Moreover, VDR mutant with alanine (S51A) eliminated
PKC-β phosphorylation but completely retained wild-type
VDR transactivation capacity and its binding ability to the
VDRE (only S51A and S51T mutants were confirmed to
form complex with the VDRE on the observable level).
Moreover, incubation of E. coli-expressed VDR with
PKC-β elicited significant decreased ability to bind
into the VDRE [55]. This observation brings the proof
that phosphorylation at position serine 51 has negative
influence on VDR transcription activity. However, it is
important to keep in mind that purified VDR from E. coli
has no other post-translation modifications (sumoylation,
ubiquitination or other phosphorylations) which can play
together an important role in VDR transcription activity
or ability to bind into the VDRE. This also suggests that
the secondary structure of region around serine at position
51 is more important for function of VDR than the
phosphorylation itself. Probably, delicate balance among
amino acids charges in this area located between two zincfingers of DNA-binding domain is essential.
Interestingly, PKC-β was found to be positively
regulated by VDR. Treatment of HL-60 cells (human
promyelocytic leukemia cell line) with 1,25(OH)2D
resulted in a 4.2-fold increase of mRNA PKC-β and
3.8-fold increase in its transcription rate [54, 56]. This
suggested positive autoregulatory loop for increased
activity of VDR by 1,25(OH)2D.
Another serine phosphorylation is described at
position 208. Unlike serine at position 51 (Figure 3),
this phosphorylation is caused by casein kinase II (CKII) localized in sequence NLDLS208EEDSDD, typical

www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

CK-II consensus recognition site, and it is enhanced
by 1,25(OH)2D [57, 58]. Replacement of serine with
glycine led to a slightly decreased 1,25(OH)2D-stimulated
transcriptional activity [59]. It corresponds to the fact
that phosphorylation at this site is not obligatory for
VDR action as at position 51 [54, 59]. Mechanism of
positive effect of phosphorylation at position 208 was
discovered later. Barletta et al. found that response of
VDR to 1,25(OH)2D was enhanced by okadaic acid
(phosphatase inhibitor), not due to up-regulation of VDR
or enhanced VDR-RXR interaction with the VDRE, but
by stimulation (3- to 4- fold) of protein-protein interaction
between VDR and DRIP205 (a subunit of the vitamin
D receptor-interacting protein) [60]. These results were
later confirmed by another research group which clearly
demonstrated positive effect of phosphorylation at position
208 for DRIP205 [61]. This data indicated a specific role
for both phosphorylation sites.
The first evidence dealing with the involvement
of protein kinase A (PKA) in ligand-dependent VDRmediated transactivation was reported in 1993 [62].
Phosphorylation of human VDR co-transfected into COS7 cells with PKA led to PKA-dependent attenuation of
1,25(OH)2D-induced transcriptional activity after 24h
[62]. The similar results were obtained for HeLa and Saos2 cell line. Significant decrease of 1,25(OH)2D-stimulated
VDR transcription activity was found in the presence
of 8-bromoadenosine cyclic 3´,5´-monophosphate (8
bromo-cAMP; activator of PKA, resistant to degradation
by cyclic AMP phosphodiesterase) in above mentioned
cell lines with co-transfected VDR and reporter gene
construct. In the HeLa and Saos-2 cell lines, the effect of
1,25(OH)2D was suppressed to 61% and 78% after 36 h,
respectively [63]. However, point mutations in possible
PKA phosphorylation sites (serine 172 and threonine 175,
both replaced by glycine) resulted in no change of VDR
response to 1,25(OH)2D [63]. Four years later, serine at
position 182 was discovered as a target of PKA (Figure
3) in the sequence SGDS182SSSCSDHC. Phosphorylation
at this position has negative impact on heterodimerization
with RXR and results in the decreased transactivation
by 1,25(OH)2D [64]. Despite of evidence about negative
influence of PKA mediated phosphorylation, Huening
et al. provided the proof about positive effect of PKA
on rat VDR [65]. Parathyroid hormone or cAMP (both
activators of PKA) up-regulated VDR and augmented
the 1,25(OH)2D-dependent induction of CYP24A1 and
osteopontin after 9 h treatment in UMR-106 cell line
(rat osteosarcoma). Induction of inducible cAMP early
repressor, serving as dominant negative regulator of
cAMP-induced transcription, repressed enhancement by
PKA activators [65]. This data show different regulation
between human and rat VDR. This may not be so much
surprising since BLAST analysis between human (NP
001017535.1) and rat (NP 058754.1) VDR shows only

90.31% identity in amino acid sequence.
Another kinase involved in the regulation of PTMs
of VDR and in clear relationship to cancer is ATM (ataxia
telangiectasia mutated). This DNA-damage response
kinase is recruited to DNA double strand breaks where it
phosphorylates H2A histone family member X (H2Ax).
However, in 2011 it was demonstrated that mutation
of putative phosphorylation sites of VDR (serine 208
and 222) impaired the ability of ATM to enhance VDR
transactivation activity [66]. Moreover, since ATM kinase
was induced by 1,25(OH)2D, the positive feedback loop
between carcinogens or oncogene stress and cancer
prevention by vitamin D was suggested.
So far, this is the complete list of known kinases
affecting VDR activity with identified or putative
phosphorylation sites, by the end of 2016. However, there
exist indications that other kinases could play a part. For
instance, researchers found that activated c-Jun N-terminal
kinase 1 (JNK1) physically and functionally interacts
with VDR and positively regulates VDR expression at
transcriptional and translational level resulting in the
increased 1,25(OH)2D-mediated inhibition of colon
cancer cell proliferation (HT29 cell line) [67]. Besides
colon cancer, it was demonstrated that JNK1 cooperates
also with p38 (another mitogen-activated protein kinase),
activating VDR and increasing 1,25(OH)2D-dependent
growth inhibition in breast cancer cells (MCF-7) [68]. This
finding could be clinically important, since a widespread
used sweetener sorbitol, an activator of JNK, is taken by
many people from diet every day [69]. On the other hand,
this might cancel the vitamin D-prevented amyloid-beta
cytotoxicity [70], a pathological marker of Alzheimer’s
disease, due to the induced amyloid precursor protein
(APP) phosphorylation by activated JNK in neurons [71].
Thus, tissue-specific phosphorylation of VDR can have
beneficial as well as adverse impacts.

the absence of ligand. On the other hand, in the presence
of cycloheximide, ligand-bound VDR was degraded
twice slower (half-life approximately 8 h) compared
to ligand-free VDR (half-life approximately 4 h) [73].
While other receptors, such as aryl hydrocarbon receptor
(AhR), estrogen receptor (ER) or mineralocorticoid
receptor (MR), are targeted for degradation by ubiquitinproteasome machinery in the presence of ligand [75-77],
1,25(OH)2D positively regulates amount of VDR protein
(without altering to mRNA) in human keratinocytes by
slowing down VDR degradation [78]. The same effect of
protection by 1,25(OH)2D was observed in osteoblasts
(hFOB, ROS 17/2.8 and primary mOSB cell lines) [79]
and human CD4+ T Cells [80] but not in intestine cell lines
(Caco-2, HT29, LS174 and mDuo) [79].
It seems that the main principle of this protection
is heterodimerization with RXR and translocation to the
nucleus after ligand binding. 1,25(OH)2D-bound VDR
without the possibility of translocation (mutations in
nuclear localization signal; R49W/R50G and K53Q/
R54G/K55E) or heterodimerization (mutations in
the dimerization interface; M383G/Q385A), is thus
a target for polyubiquitination and 26S proteasomemediated degradation [79]. The sequence required for
polyubiquitination of VDR is possibly localized between
amino acid residues 403 and 410 (CLSFQPEC), since
deletion of this region diminished polyubiquitination of
VDR in transfected Cos-1 cells [79]. However, there is no
lysine residue required for covalent ligation of ubiquitin by
E3 ligase within this sequence. Consequently, researchers
assumed lysine on position 399 (Figure 3) as a possible
target of an E3 ligase.
Recently, it has been shown that cyclin-dependent
kinase 11, a 58 kDa protein (CDK11p58), is an interacting
partner of VDR. Upon binding to VDR, CDK11p58
promotes VDR ubiquitination (Figure 3) leading
to decreased level of protein and repressed VDRdependent transcriptional activation. This data suggested
CDK11p58 as a negative regulator of VDR activity and
stability. However, the exact mechanism of promoting
ubiquitination is still unclear [81].

Ubiquitination
The modification of the VDR by the covalent
attachment of one or more ubiquitin molecules is termed
ubiquitination. These small proteins (8.5 kDa) act
usually as a recognition signal for 26S proteasome. The
ubiquitin-proteasome pathway is the major route for the
selective degradation of short-lived regulatory proteins in
eukaryotic cells [72].
The first evidence about proteasome-mediated
degradation of VDR was brought in 1998 [73]. It was
shown that activation function 2 (AF-2; ligand-dependent
domain localized on C-terminus of VDR (Figure 3) [73,
74]) domain of human VDR interacts with suppressor
for gal 1 (SUG1, component of the 26S proteasome) in
ROS17/2.8 cell line (rat osteosarcoma). This interaction
targets VDR for proteasome-mediated degradation.
Treatment with 26S proteasome inhibitors (MG132, betalactone) increased steady-state level of the VDR protein in

Sumoylation
Small Ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) is a family
of small proteins covalently attached to lysine residues of
other proteins in cells to modify their activity and function
in process called sumoylation. This mechanism, essential
for genome stability, was identified in mammals, where
SUMO was found to be covalently linked to the RanGTPase activating protein (RanGAP1) [82, 83]. Several
members of the nuclear receptor superfamily were also
identified as targets of sumoylation, for example - estrogen
receptor (ER) [84], androgen receptor (AR) [85], pregnane
X receptor (PXR) [86] and peroxisome proliferatoractivated receptor gamma (PPAR-γ) [87], with significant

impact upon their function as transcriptional activators.
The first identification of VDR as a target of
SUMO2 (in humans were confirmed 4 isoforms of SUMO
differing in amino acid sequence [88]) was demonstrated
in 2012 [89]. Sumoylation of VDR is facilitated by protein
inhibitor of activated STAT 4 (PIAS4) having E3-ligase
activity and serving as a potent inhibitor of transcriptional
response to 1,25(OH)2D [89]. Thus, sumoylation results in
the decreased transcriptional activity of VDR. Moreover,
it was found that sentrin/SUMO specific protease 1
and 2 (SENP1 and SENP2) can reverse modifications
of VDR by SUMO2. This led to potentiated ligandmediated transactivation of VDR. These fine-tuning
effects are cell line-dependent. While the most achieved
potent modulatory effects were described in Caco-2 and
HEK-293 cells, the 1,25(OH)2D signal in MCF-7 cells
was unaffected by tested SENP [90]. The same research
group identified lysine 91 (localized in potential site II
(non-consensus) acceptor site; VDR lacks a true SUMO
consensus sequence) as a minor SUMO acceptor site
within VDR [90].

indicating blockage of translation rather than increased
mRNA degradation. However, more experiments are
required to elucidate the regulation of VDR via miRNAs
and to show correlating effects of miRNAs decrease with
increased sensitivity to 1,25(OH)2D anticancer activity.
Thus, monitoring the level of miRNAs mentioned above
could be used as a biomarker in order to justify vitamin
D supplementation for supportive treatment in anticancer
therapies. Additionally, searching for the therapeutics
decreasing the expression of these miRNAs might
be useful for sensitization of cancers for consequent
vitamin D treatments. This was reported for celecoxib, a
nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) capable of
restoring the level of miR-29c, which is downregulated
in gastric cancer tissues. Increased expression of miR-29c
induced apoptosis in gastric cancer cells via suppression
of oncogene Mcl-1 [95].
To this date, only three major post-translational
modifications of VDR (phosphorylation, sumoylation
and ubiquitination) have been demonstrated. The last two
modifications were identified recently and it will take more
time for precise understanding how these modifications
affect the VDR activity or biology. Other PTMs, such as
acetylation, glycosylation, palmitoylation or methylation
have not been proven in VDR protein yet. However, some
of these modifications were demonstrated in other nuclear
receptors, including AR, liver x receptor (LXR) or ER-α
[92, 96, 97].
Since VDR holds many posts in human biology,
deciphering the role of PTMs in context of proper VDR
signaling or improved pharmacotherapy is crucial. Some
of the modifications like sumoylation, ubiquitination or
acetylation take place on nitrogen atom of lysine residue.
Thus, these PTMs create interface for protein binding as
a “gain of function” mechanism and may modulate the
protein function, such as of protein-protein interaction,
DNA binding, transcriptional activity, stability and
subcellular localization. In addition, they greatly alter
the electrostatic properties of a protein by neutralizing
the positive charge of the lysine residue. Furthermore,
they disrupt a formation of hydrogen bonds on lysine
side-chains. Moreover, type of binding for instance to
either lysine 48 (K48) or lysine 63 (K63) in ubiquitin
determines either a recognition signal for 26S proteasome
degradation (K48) or a molecular platform for proteinprotein interaction or receptor trafficking (K63) [98].
Possible benefits of knowledge of this type of
PTM could be found among patients with plasmablastic
lymphoma or myeloma cells. It was demonstrated that
vitamin D inhibited the growth of these cells and that
FokI variant of VDR displayed greater growth inhibition
[99]. Since inhibition of proteasome increases the VDR
protein together with higher stability of VDR in the
presence of ligand, especially multiple myeloma (MM)
patients, treated with proteasome inhibitor bortezomib,
might greatly benefit from vitamin D supplementation.

Acetylation
Reaction that introduces an acetyl functional group
into a molecule is termed acetylation. It is common
modification in most nuclear receptors, including PXR
[91], AR or ERα [92]. Surprisingly, there is no clear
proof of VDR protein acetylation to this date. Indirect
evidence was brought by Stone et al., who demonstrated
potentiation of VDR activity by resveratrol, NADdependent deacetylase sirtuin-1 (SIRT1) activator [93].
Resveratrol and 1,25(OH)2D have synergistic effect
on VDR-RXR heterodimerization and VDR-mediated
transcription. Comparison of wild-type VDR and ligandbinding domain mutant VDR has shown that response to
1,25(OH)2D was severely depressed, while the response to
resveratrol was only moderately attenuated. This implies
an indirect effect of resveratrol to VDR [93]. Moreover,
phylogenetic analysis of PXR and VDR suggests that
lysine residue in VDR protein equivalent to lysine 109
in PXR might undergo acetylation similarly as it was
demonstrated in PXR [91].

DISCUSSION
This review provides basic information about posttranscriptional and post-translational modifications of
the VDR. It is surprising, that transcription factor, which
regulates more than 1000 genes [94], has not been well
studied in this research area.
In the case of post-transcriptional regulation,
only two miRNAs regulating the amount of VDR were
found. Interestingly, both miRNAs can reduce VDR
on the protein level with no effect on the mRNA level,

Moreover, this supplementation could mitigate peripheral
neuropathy observed in 25(OH)D-deficient MM patients
[100].
Genetic polymorphisms affect most of the genes,
making VDR gene no exception. These changes in the
core DNA sequence may result in the different amino acid
sequence in final protein. Consequently, this may affect
resulting behavior of VDR as it was observed in the case
of mutated serine 51 [54, 55]. In addition, different levels
of VDR expression as well as PTMs-creating enzymes in
different tissues may highlight the importance of these
PTMs in physiology/pathology of particular tissue. This
seems to be true especially for cancer. It was demonstrated
that carcinogens- or DNA double strand breaks-triggered
ATM kinase positively stimulates activity of VDR, which
in turn induces ATM gene expression [66]. This creates a
positive feedback loop and contributes to chemopreventive
mechanism of vitamin D. Thus, genotyping the patients
with cancer for mutations at serine residues 208/222 of
VDR might be used for exclusion of these patients from
vitamin D-directed anti-cancer therapy.
Another example represents the Alzheimer’s
disease (AD), in therapy of which some studies suggested
protective role of vitamin D [101, 102]. Moreover, it
was demonstrated that vitamin D prevented amyloidbeta cytotoxicity, one of the major components of AD
pathology, in primary cortical neurons [70]. This opens a
new strategy in treatment or at least in slowing down the
progression of this disease. Moreover, the sensitization of
this process could be achieved by development of specific
PKA inhibitors, especially those targeting catalytic (Cβ) or
regulatory subunit (RIIβ) of PKA, which are expressed at
high levels in nervous system [103].
In general, the field of PTMs of VDR represents
great knowledge that can be used for understanding of
physiological impact of this receptor. Moreover, this
knowledge can be used at least for preventive purposes of
some pathological states. However, every step we make
leads us to a new unexplored territory that is usually not
much clear in terms of consequences it may have. Many
studies must be conducted in order to better understand
all the connections and consequences between posttranscriptional/-translational modifications of VDR and
its activity.
