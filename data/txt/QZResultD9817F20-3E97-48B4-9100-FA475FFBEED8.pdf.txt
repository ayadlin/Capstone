Abstract
The transcription factor CCAAT/enhancer binding protein-A
(C/EBPA) is involved in the control of cell differentiation and
proliferation, and has been suggested to act as a tumor
suppressor in several cancers. By using microarray analysis,
we have previously shown that hypoxia and estrogen downregulate C/EBPA mRNA in T-47D breast cancer cells. Here, we
have examined the mechanism by which the down-regulation
by hypoxia takes place. Using the specific RNA polymerase II
inhibitor 5,6-dichlorobenzimidazole-1-B-D-ribofuranoside, the
mRNA stability was analyzed under normoxia or hypoxia by
quantitative reverse transcription-PCR. Hypoxia reduced
the half-life of C/EBPA mRNA by f30%. C/EBPa gene
promoter studies indicated that hypoxia also repressed the
transcription of the gene and identified a hypoxia-responsive
element ( 522; 527 bp), which binds to hypoxia-inducible
factor (HIF)-1A, as essential for down-regulation of C/EBPA
transcription in hypoxia. Immunocytochemical analysis
showed that C/EBPA was localized in the nucleus at 21% O2,
but was mostly cytoplasmic under 1% O2. Knockdown of
HIF-1A by RNAi restored C/EBPA to normal levels under
hypoxic conditions. Immunohistochemical studies of 10 tumor
samples did not show any colocalization of C/EBPA and
glucose transporter 1 (used as a marker for hypoxia). Taken
together, these results show that hypoxia down-regulates
C/EBPA expression in breast cancer cells by several mechanisms, including transcriptional and posttranscriptional
effects. The down-regulation of C/EBPA in hypoxia is
mediated by HIF-1. [Cancer Res 2008;68(7):2158–65]

Introduction
The CCAAT/enhancer binding protein (C/EBP) transcription
factors belong to a six-member family (a, h, g, y, q, and ~) of
leucine-zipper DNA-binding proteins, which are involved in cell
cycle regulation and differentiation in various cell types. C/EBPa,
the founding member of the C/EBP family, regulates the
transcription of several target genes in the mammary gland and
in some other tissues such as adipose tissue, liver, and peripheral
blood mononuclear cells (1). C/EBPa induces cell differentiation

and slows down proliferation by stabilization of p21/WAF1,
resulting in inhibition of cyclin-dependent kinase activity and
E2F-mediated transcription (2–6), and it has been shown that
C/EBPa expression is down-regulated in breast cancers (7, 8).
Reduced C/EBPa expression or C/EBPa gene mutations have also
been associated with cancer of the lung, breast, and skin and
myeloid leukemias (7, 9–11), and C/EBPa has been shown to
function as a tumor suppressor (12, 13).
We have previously shown that both hypoxia and estrogen
down-regulate C/EBPa mRNA levels in T-47D breast cancer cells
using DNA microarrays (14). Both estrogen and hypoxia have
profound effects on cancer cell growth. Hypoxia is commonly
found in solid tumors and is able to profoundly alter the expression
of a wide range of genes, leading to a dedifferentiated, more
aggressive phenotype as well as therapy resistance (15, 16). The
cellular response to hypoxia is mainly mediated by hypoxiainducible factor 1 (HIF-1), a heterodimer composed of HIF-1a and
HIF-1h (also known as aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator; refs. 17, 18). Whereas HIF-1h is constitutively expressed,
HIF-1a is tightly regulated by the oxygen concentration and
determines the activity of HIF-1. HIF-1a is overexpressed in
biopsies of several human cancers including breast cancer (19).
Whereas the effects of hypoxia on angiogenesis and cellular
metabolism have been well characterized, the mechanism through
which it alters cellular differentiation and cell cycle control is
poorly understood. We hypothesize that one possible mechanism
is the down-regulation of critical transcription factors such as
C/EBPa.
The aim of the present study was to examine the mechanism(s)
through which the hypoxia-induced down-regulation of C/EBPa
takes place. Using quantitative reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR),
electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA), Western blots, C/EBPa
promoter activity studies, and small interfering RNA (siRNA)
knockdown of HIF-1a, we show that hypoxia down-regulates
C/EBPa in T-47D breast cancer cells through multiple mechanisms.
Most notably, down-regulation of C/EBPa under hypoxia was
found to occur by transcriptional repression mediated by HIF-1a.

Materials and Methods
Cell lines and cell culture. The estrogen receptor–expressing human
breast cancer cell lines T-47D (ATCC HTB-133) and MCF-7 (ATCC HTB-22)
were maintained at 37jC, 5% CO2 in DMEM (Invitrogen) supplemented
with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 0.1 Amol/L insulin (Sigma-Aldrich),
0.5 Ag/mL fungizone (Squibb), 100 units/mL penicillin, and 100 Ag/mL
streptomycin (Invitrogen). Twenty-four hours before exposure to hypoxic
conditions, the medium was replaced with medium without phenol red and
steroids (achieved by charcoal-filtering of FBS; this medium was used for all
experiments, hereafter referred to as ‘‘experimental medium’’). Cells used

in biochemical studies were grown to 40% to 60% confluence in 100-mm cell
culture dishes or in six-well plates. The volumes of cell culture media used
during hypoxia experiments were 8 mL for cells grown in 100-mm cell
culture dishes and 2 mL/well for cells cultured in six-well plates.
Desferrioxamine and hypoxia treatment. Hypoxia was achieved by
placing the cell culture dishes in a RSBiotech MiniGalaxy A Oxygen (O2)
control incubator, kept at 1% O2, 5% CO2, 94% N2, 37jC, and constant
humidity. All oxygen concentrations reported are nominal oxygen concentrations, representing the oxygen concentration in the cell culture
atmosphere. For transfection experiments, we used the iron chelator
desferrioxamine at a final concentration of 100 Amol/L to mimic
hypoxia.
Transcriptional inhibition and mRNA stability assay. The transcription inhibitor 5,6-dichlorobenzimidazole-1-h-D-ribofuranoside (DRB; Sigma)
was added directly to T-47D breast cancer cells cultured in experimental
medium (stock solution, 100 mmol/L in DMSO; final concentration,
100 Amol/L; ref. 20). The cells were then exposed to hypoxia (1% O2) for
1, 2, 4, or 8 h. At these time points, the cells were harvested for PCR analysis
of C/EBPa mRNA levels.
Quantitative real-time RT-PCR. Total RNA was extracted from breast
cancer cell lines with NucleoSpin RNA II kit (Macherey-Nagel EURL). Firststrand cDNA was generated with iScript cDNA Synthesis kit (Bio-Rad
Laboratories), and real-time PCR was carried out with the iCycler iQ System
(Bio-Rad) using iQ SYBR Green Supermix (Bio-Rad) according to the
manufacturer’s instruction. All PCRs were done in duplicate. The sequences
of the HIF-1a and C/EBPa primers were designed with Oligo Analyzer 1.0.2
(Kuopio University, Finland) based on human HIF-1a and C/EBPa mRNA
sequences, respectively, as follows: HIF-1a, forward 5¶-TGCTAATGCCACCACTACC-3¶ and reverse 5¶-TGACTCCTTTTCCTGCTCTG-3¶; C/EBPa,
forward 5¶-CCTTGTGCAATGTGAATGTGC-3¶ and reverse 5¶-CGGAGAGTCTCATTTTGGCAA-3¶. The primers of vascular endothelial growth
factor (VEGF) and RPL13A were as follows: VEGF, forward 5¶CTTTCTG CTGTCTTGG GTG -3 ¶ a nd rev e rs e 5¶-ACTTCGTGATGATTCTGCC-3¶; RPL13A, forward 5¶-CCTGGAGGAGAAGAGGAAAGAGA-3¶
and reverse 5¶-GAGGACCTCTGTGTATTTGTCAA-3¶. Up-regulation and
down-regulation of HIF-1a, VEGF, and C/EBPa were determined by the
2 DDCt method (21) and normalized to RPL13A levels. The results are given
as relative fold increase or decrease compared with cells cultured under
normoxia.

Plasmids and transient transfection. Firefly luciferase reporter
plasmids containing various regions of the CEBPa promoter (C/EBPluc-576,
C/EBPluc-416, C/EBPluc-119, and C/EBPluc-76) and the control plasmid
without the C/EBPa promoter (pXP1-luc; ref. 22) were kindly provided by G.J.
Darlington (Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX). Three new plasmids
were generated from C/EBPluc-576 by mutating three HIF consensus
sequences in this region [hypoxia-responsive element (HRE)-1 Mut, HRE2
Mut, HRE3 Mut] with QuickChange II Site-Directed mutagenesis kit
(Stratagen) according to the manufacturer’s recommendations. The primers
used to mutate the sites are the following: HRE1 Mut-F, GAGATCAGAGCTAGGAG ATCTAGAG C C AC CG CGCTC AG; HRE1 Mut-R ,
CTGAGCGCGGTGGCTCTAGATCTCCTAGCTCTGATCTC; HRE2 Mut-Fm

CCCCGCTGCTCTGCGCTTACGCCTCCCCGGGACGCGG; HRE3 Mut-R,
CCGCGTCCCGGGGAGGCGTAAGCGCAGAGCAGCGGGG. The PCR was
done using the C/EBPluc-576 plasmid as DNA template and Pfu Ultra
polymerase for 18 amplification cycles (denaturation at 95jC, 30 s; annealing
at 55jC, 1 min; elongation at 68jC, 7 min). The amplification product was
incubated with DpnI, a methylated DNA–specific enzyme, to digest the
parental DNA template. Using a heat shock transformation, the plasmid was
introduced into pXL1-blue competent bacteria, which were selected with
ampicillin.
Transient transfection of plasmids was carried out with the Lipofectamine 2000 transfection reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, 24 h before transfection, 4  105 T-47D cells
were seeded in experimental medium in six-well plates. Plasmids (3 Ag)
were transfected under normoxia (21% O2) with 8 AL of Lipofectamine for
6 h before the transfection medium was replaced. After 16 h, cells were
exposed to hypoxia (1% O2) or to desferrioxamine (100 Amol/L) for 24 h.
After harvesting, cell extracts were assayed for luciferase activity by using
firefly D-luciferin (Euromedex) as a substrate and measuring luminescence
in a Berthold(a) CliniLumat luminometer. Transfections were done in
duplicate and the activity of the firefly luciferase was normalized to the

protein levels of the samples (assessed by Bio-Rad detergent-compatible
protein assay).
siRNA transfection. Stealth RNAi (Invitrogen) targeted to HIF-1a or
siRNA oligonucleotides directed toward HIF-1a ligated into the pTer vector
were transiently transfected into T-47D cells to knock down HIF-1a gene
expression. To construct pTer-HIF, gene-specific oligonucleotides were
chosen as previously described (23). The HIF-1a oligonucleotides targeted
nucleotides 1,521 to 1,541 of the HIF-1a mRNA sequence (NM001530) and
were as follows: forward, 5¶-CUGAUGACCAGCAACUUGAdTdT-3¶; reverse,
5¶-UCAAGUUGCUGGUCAUCAGdTdT-3¶. The sequences were ligated into
the pTer vector that had been digested with EcoR1 and Xho1.
For knockdown of HIF-1a, T-47D cells were seeded 24 h before
transfection in six-well plates (4  105 per well, for transfection with stealth
RNAi) or in 10-cm cell culture dishes (2  106 per dish, for transfection with
pTer-HIF) in experimental medium. Transfections were done in serumfree Opti-MEM transfection medium with 150 pmol RNAi and 5 AL of
Lipofectamine for 5 h for stealth RNAi, or with 10 Ag plasmid and 25 AL
of Lipofectamine for 24 h for pTer-HIF. The transfection medium was
then replaced with experimental medium, and the cells were incubated for
16 h to allow time for HIF-1a knockdown. The T-47D cells were then exposed
to hypoxia (1%) for 24 h. Controls were transfected with the scrambled
siRNA or the empty vector pTer. BLOCK-iT Fluorescent Oligo (Invitrogen)
was used to monitor the efficiency of the stealth RNAi transfection.
Protein extraction, subcellular fractionation, and Western blot
analysis. Total protein extracts were used for most of the experiments
done. Cells were placed on ice and washed with PBS without Ca2+ and Mg2+
and subsequently lysed in cold lysis buffer containing 90 mmol/L Tris-HCl
(pH 6.8), 3% SDS, and 15% glycerol.
To assess the C/EBPa content in nuclear and cytosolic extracts,
subcellular fractionation was done as previously described (24). Equal
amounts of protein (30–40 Ag) were separated on 7.5% (HIF-1a) or 10%
(VEGF and C/EBPa) SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred onto
nitrocellulose membranes (Perkin-Elmer). Actin and lamin B were used as
controls for loading and cellular fragmentation and were done in parallel on
10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. After blocking with 0.2% casein (I-Block
reagent, Tropix) in PBS with 0.1% Tween 20, the membranes were incubated
overnight at 4jC with the primary antibodies specific for C/EBPa (rabbit
polyclonal, 1:1,000; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), HIF-1a (mouse monoclonal,
1:1,000; Novus Biologicals, Inc.), VEGF (rabbit polyclonal, 1:1,000; Santa Cruz
Biotechnology), actin (rabbit polyclonal, 1:1,000; Sigma), and lamin B
(mouse monoclonal, 1:1,000; Oncogene Research Products). Blots were

washed and incubated with antimouse or antirabbit antibodies conjugated
to alkaline phosphatase (1:20,000; Tropix) for 1 h at room temperature, and
subsequently washed and revealed with CDP Star chemoluminescence
reagent (Perkin-Elmer).
EMSAs. We performed EMSA to determine whether HIF-1a could bind
to the C/EBPa promoter. The consensus binding site for HIF-1a, the
putative HRE sequences in the C/EPBa promoter (HRE1, HRE2, HRE3, and
HRE4), and their mutated counterparts (HRE1 Mut and HRE2 Mut) were
synthesized and used as oligonucleotide probes for EMSA (Table 1). Probes
were obtained by annealing the coding and noncoding strands and labeling
the duplex molecules with the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I in the
presence of [a-32P]dCTP (>3,000 Ci/mmol; 1 Ci = 37 GBq).
First, EMSA was done to assess binding of the HRE and the putative HRE
sequences to nuclear extract from T-47D cells maintained at 21% O2 or at
1% O2. Reactions were carried out as previously described with 10 Ag of
nuclear extract and 0.1 ng of each radiolabeled oligonucleotide probe (25).
Binding specificity was assessed by (a) competitive EMSA, by incubating
the radiolabeled putative HRE sequences with nuclear extracts from
hypoxic T-47D cells in presence of 10- or 100-fold excess of unlabeled
consensus HRE oligonucleotide; and (b) antibody competition, by
preincubating nuclear extracts with 4 and 8 Ag of rabbit polyclonal
HIF-1a ODDD antibody for 2 h on ice before incubating with HRE1 and
HRE2 probes for 30 min at room temperature. Eight micrograms of purified
polyclonal rabbit IgG were used as negative control and were similarly
treated. Complexes were resolved by electrophoresis as described above,
then dried and autoradiographed with PhosphoImager.
EMSA was also done to assess binding of wild-type and mutated HRE1
and HRE2 to nuclear extract from T-47D cells maintained at 21% O2 or at 1%
O2. After electrophoretic separation of nonshifted and shifted oligonucleotide probes, results were quantified with PhosphoImager (ImageQuant
software). This experiment was paralleled with the detection of nucleoprotein complexes with the same oligonucleotides as nonradioactive probes and
the same concentration of nuclear extracts. After electrophoretic separation,
nucleoprotein complexes were electrotransferred onto nitrocellulose sheets,
which were probed with a rabbit polyclonal HIF-1a ODDD antibody
(provided by Dr. Jacques Pouyssegur, CNRS UMR 6543, Centre Antoine
Lacassagne, Nice, France) diluted at 1:1,000. Detection was carried out with
antirabbit antibodies conjugated to alkaline phosphatase (1:20,000; Tropix),
and subsequent revelation with CDP Star chemoluminescence reagent
(Perkin-Elmer).
Patients and immunohistochemical study. Ten ductal breast carcinoma samples, obtained from patients surgically treated for breast cancer in
the gynecologic oncology department of Georges Pompidou European
Hospital were studied. Samples were formalin fixed, paraffin embedded,
and stained with H&E. Breast carcinomas were classified according to the
Scarff-Bloom-Richardson (SBR) breast cancer grading system modified by
Elston and Ellis (26). All these tumors express estrogen receptor (Table 1). An
immunohistochemical study was done on freshly cut 4-Am serial sections
with estrogen receptor monoclonal antibody (NCL-ER-6F11/2; Novocastra),
glucose transporter 1 (Glut-1) polyclonal antibody (used as a marker for
hypoxia; DAKO), and C/EBPa polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Positive controls consisted of normal breast tissue for estrogen receptor
and C/EBPa antibodies and red blood cells for Glut 1 antibody.
Immunocytochemistry studies. T-47D cells were seeded at a density of
4  104/mL of experimental medium in a four-well Lab-Tek II chamber
slide. The cells were then incubated for 24 h under 21% O2 or 1% O2. Cells
were washed with PBS, fixed on ice with 4% paraformaldehyde-PBS for
15 min, and permeabilized for 5 min in 0.1% Triton-PBS followed by three
PBS washes. Nonspecific sites were saturated with 5% bovine serum
albumin-PBS for 30 min before exposure for 1 h to an anti-C/EBPa goat
polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology; 1:250 dilution in 1% donkey
serum-PBS). Negative controls were obtained by omitting the primary
antibody. The cells were washed twice in PBS-Tween and incubated for
1 h with donkey anti-goat IgG Alexa 488 (1:600 in PBS; Molecular Probes,
Invitrogen). Cell nuclei were counterstained with 4¶,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI). After final rinses in 0.1% PBS/Tween and PBS, slides were
mounted with Vectashield containing DAPI (Vector Lab) and fluorescence

was assessed by fluorescence microscopy combined with confocal analysis
in a Nikon Labophot 2 equipped with a FITC filter.
Proliferation and cell cycle analysis. T-47D cells were cultured under
1% O2 or 21% O2 in experimental medium for 24 h before harvesting for
fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis of S-phase fraction. Bromodeoxyuridine (BrdUrd; 10 Amol/L) was added to the cultures for pulse labeling of
S phase 20 min before harvesting. The cells were then trypsinized, fixed
in 70% ice-cold ethanol for 3 h, and labeled with propidium iodide. Cell
cycle progression was analyzed by dual-parameter flow cytometry with a
FACSCalibur flow cytofluorometer (Becton-Dickinson Biosciences) and
CellQuest Pro software (BD Biosciences). The proliferative index (PI; ref. 27)
and S-phase fraction (SPF) were calculated using the following formulas:
SPF = [S / (G0-G1 + S + G2-M)]  100, and PI = [(S + G2-M) / (G0-G1 + S +
G2-M)]  100.
Statistical analysis. Mann-Whitney U test was used to compare the
mean C/EBPa mRNA relative levels in cells cultured under normoxia and
hypoxia. For all other studies, means of treatment groups were compared
with one-way ANOVA. When the ANOVA showed that there were significant
differences between the groups, Dunnett’s test or Bonferroni’s test was used
to identify the sources of these differences. P V 0.05 was considered
statistically significant.

Results
Hypoxia reduces C/EBPA expression in breast cancer cells.
Using quantitative real-time RT-PCR, we found that hypoxia
significantly reduced C/EBPa mRNA levels in T-47D and MCF-7
breast cancer cells by f60% (Fig. 1A). The down-regulation of
C/EBPa mRNA levels was paralleled by a similar decrease in
C/EBPa protein in both cell lines (Fig. 1B).
Hypoxia decreases C/EBPA mRNA stability. C/EBPa mRNA
stability in T-47D cells cultured under hypoxia or normoxia was
examined after treatment with the transcriptional inhibitor DRB
(Fig. 2). Half-lives of C/EBPa mRNA were estimated by exponential

regression. Hypoxia reduced the half-life of C/EBPa mRNA by
f30% [105 F 6.67 minutes (r 2 = 0.96) for 21% O2 and 74.34 F
4.44 minutes (r 2 = 0.99) for 1% O2; P < 0.05; Fig. 2].
Hypoxia and desferrioxamine reduce the transcriptional
activity of the C/EBPA promoter. The effect of hypoxia and
desferrioxamine on the regulation of C/EBPa transcription was
investigated by transfecting T-47D cells with a reporter plasmid
coupled to different fragments of the C/EBPa promoter (Fig. 3A).
Cells transfected with C/EBPluc-576 displayed an f40% reduction
in luciferase reporter activity under hypoxia when compared with
normoxic controls (P < 0.001; Fig. 3B). Desferrioxamine caused a
similar but less potent effect (P < 0.01). In cells transfected with the
smaller promoter fragments (C/EBPluc-416 and C/EBPluc-119),
luciferase activity was not influenced by hypoxia or desferrioxamine. The smallest promoter fragment, C/EBPluc-76, did not give
any measurable luciferase activity when transfected into cells even
under normoxic conditions and was not used for the studies of
hypoxia effects (Fig. 3A).
EMSAs. Analysis of the C/EBPa promoter sequence (available
in the human genome database Ensembl) revealed the presence
of four putative binding sites for HIF-1a in the 576/ 416
region, here referred to as HRE1, HRE2, HRE3, and HRE4
(see Fig. 4A).The ability of the putative HREs found in the 576/
416 region of the C/EBPa promoter sequence to bind to nuclear
extracts prepared from T-47D cells maintained at 21% O2 or at 1%
O2 was assessed by EMSA analysis. A consensus HRE was used
as a control for all experiments.
A shifted complex was observed for the HRE, HRE1, HRE2, and
HRE3 sequences when incubated with nuclear extracts from cells
cultured under hypoxic conditions (Fig. 4B). In some cases, a
shifted band was also observed after incubation with extracts from
cells cultured under normoxia; however, these bands were always

weaker than those observed in the corresponding hypoxic
conditions. In contrast, a little oligonucleotide shift was observed
for HRE4 under either condition. The binding specificity of the
sequences was investigated by competition experiments. The five
sequences, including the consensus sequence, were incubated with
excess (10- or 100-fold) unlabeled HRE. All sequences showed
decreased binding after incubation with extracts from cells
cultured under hypoxia in the presence of increasing amounts of
competitor (10- to 100-fold; Fig. 4C).
HRE1 is critical for down-regulation of C/EBPA promoter
activity in hypoxia. Additional reporter plasmid constructs
carrying C/EBPa promoter fragments mutated in each of the
three HREs that were found to bind to HIF-1a (HRE1, HRE2, or
HRE3) were prepared and the promoter activity of these fragments
was assessed under normoxia or hypoxia after transfection into
T47-D cells.
Mutation of the HRE3 site did not alter the effect of hypoxia, and
therefore this site was not studied further. When HRE2 was
mutated, basal activity was slightly increased and the effect of
hypoxia was even more pronounced than in the wild-type

fragment. Interestingly, mutation of the HRE1 site resulted in a
complete loss of the hypoxia effect (Fig. 4D). Subsequently, EMSA
analysis was carried out with mutated HRE1 and HRE2 sequences,
which were compared with the corresponding wild-type sequences.
To investigate whether HIF-1a was present in the nucleocomplex, we tested if HIF-1a antibodies could supershift it. When HRE,
our positive control, was used as a probe, the HIF-1a ODDD
antibody (applied at dilutions of 1:10 and 1:5) was able to inhibit
the formation of the nucleocomplex but did not supershift it
(Supplementary Fig. S1A, lanes 3 and 4), probably because the
binding of the antibody to nuclear HIF-1a prevented it from
binding to DNA. The same result was observed for HRE1 and HRE2
(respectively lanes 8, 9 and 13, 14 for HRE1 and HRE2). Polyclonal
rabbit IgG (lanes 5, 10, and 15) used at 1:5 dilution did not affect
the complex formation. Taken together, these results suggest the
presence of HIF-1a in the shifted complexes.
We next assessed the binding of mutated HRE1 and HRE2 to the
nuclear extracts. As seen in Supplementary Fig. S1B (higher panel),
mutations in the HRE1 and HRE2 sequences caused considerably
decreased binding of nuclear extract from cells cultured under

the presence of four putative binding sites for HIF-1a in the 576/ 416 region, here referred to as HRE1, HRE2, HRE3, and HRE4 (underlined ). B, EMSA was done
with 0.1 ng of radiolabeled HRE and wild-type HRE1, HRE2, HRE3, and HRE4 oligonucleotides in the presence of 10 Ag of nuclear extracts from cells maintained

hypoxic conditions (Supplementary Fig. S1C). The oligonucleotideprotein complexes were then transferred onto nitrocellulose
membranes and shift-Western blot analysis was done with a specific HIF-1a antibody. The results showed the presence of HIF-1a
bound to the wild-type sequences (HRE, HRE1, and HRE2) after
incubation with nuclear extracts of cells cultured under hypoxic
conditions, whereas no bands were present when the cells had
been cultured under normoxic conditions. No HIF-1a immunoreactive band was observed for the mutated HRE1 Mut and a weak
band was detected for HRE2 Mut, showing that mutation of HRE1
and HRE2 considerably abolishes or decreases binding of HIF-1a to
these sequences (Supplementary Fig. S1B, bottom).
HIF-1A knockdown restores C/EBPA levels in T-47D cells
cultured under hypoxia. Next, we investigated whether HIF-1a
silencing with stealth RNAi would affect the down-regulation of
C/EBPa observed in breast cancer cells cultured under hypoxia.
Silencing of HIF-1a in T-47D cells cultured under hypoxia led to
complete restoration of C/EBPa mRNA levels when compared with
cells grown under normoxia (Fig. 5A, left). HIF-1a knockdown by
stealth RNAi led to a reduction in HIF-1a mRNA levels by 70% to
80%, showing knockdown efficiency (Fig. 5A, middle). HIF-1a
silencing also reduced VEGF induction under hypoxia (Fig. 5A, right).
Silencing of HIF-1a also prevented the down-regulation of
C/EBPa protein levels in T-47D cells (Fig. 5B, top). Furthermore, in
cells where HIF-1a was silenced with stealth RNAi, the induction of
HIF-1a in hypoxia was greatly reduced, and hypoxia could no
longer increase VEGF protein levels, showing the efficacy of HIF-1a
silencing on the protein level (Fig. 5B).
The experiment was repeated in T-47D cells transfected with
plasmid siRNA targeted to HIF-1a (pTer-HIF). Again, we observed
restitution of C/EBPa mRNA and protein levels, reduced HIF-1a
mRNA and protein levels, and reduced induction of VEGF in cells

transfected with siRNA targeted to HIF-1a cultured under hypoxic
conditions (Supplementary Fig. S2).
Immunohistochemistry. Immunohistochemical study was
done for C/EBPa and Glut-1 (a marker of hypoxia) on 10 tumor
samples, all of which were estrogen receptor positive (Supplementary Fig. S3A). Two SBR2 tumors had a homogeneous pattern of
C/EBPa immunostaining with >50% immunostained cells. Two
tumors (SBR2 and SBR3) presented a heterogeneous pattern of
C/EBPa immunostaining with 10% to 15% immunostained cells.
Finally, six of the ten tumors were C/EBPa negative or very weakly
positive (<10% immunostained cells). These six tumors were
composed of the three SBR1 tumors, two of the five SBR2 tumors,
and one of the two SBR3 tumors. Glut-1 membrane immunostaining (5–20% of immunostained cells) was encountered in four
tumors, all measuring at least 20 mm. This percentage of Glut1–positive tumors in breast cancers was in agreement with
previous reports (28). Comparison of C/EBPa and Glut-1
expressions showed that positive Glut-1 areas were always
associated with negative C/EBPa areas (Supplementary Fig. S3B
and C) except in one case in which positive Glut-1 expression was
associated with some weakly positive C/EBPa cells (tumor sample
10). These observations on tumor samples are in agreement with
the negative effect of hypoxia on C/EBPa gene expression.
Hypoxia modifies the subcellular localization and protein
level of C/EBPA. Immunocytochemistry experiments were done
to determine the subcellular localization of endogenous C/EBPa
proteins under different conditions. As seen in Fig. 6, the localization of C/EBPa was highly regulated by oxygen concentration.
C/EBPa was mainly nuclear under normoxia (Fig. 6A) but
relocated to become mostly cytoplasmic under hypoxia (Fig. 6B).
C/EBPa protein levels were also assessed in the nuclear and
cytoplasmic fractions of cells cultured under normoxia or hypoxia

by Western blots (Supplementary Fig. S4). The C/EBPa protein
levels were slightly increased in the cytosol and markedly
decreased in the nuclear fraction of hypoxic cells as compared
with control cells, confirming the relocalization of this protein to
the cytosol in hypoxia.
Proliferation and cell cycle analysis. A small but significant
increase in cell proliferation was observed in cells cultured under
1% O2 for 24 hours when compared with cells cultured under
normoxic conditions (Supplementary Table S1). Furthermore, cell
cycle progression analysis showed a small but significant increase
in the percentage of cells found in S and G2-M phases after
24 hours of culture under hypoxic conditions as compared with
normoxic culture conditions. The proliferative index was thus
increased from 38.85 F 0.86 in normoxia to 42.67 F 0.64 in hypoxia,
indicating mildly increased proliferation of cells cultured under
short-term hypoxic conditions.

Discussion
Hypoxia is common in solid tumors and up-regulates several
target genes involved in angiogenesis, anaerobic energy metabolism, cell survival, cell invasion, and drug resistance, thereby
contributing to the progression of a more malignant phenotype
and to increased resistance to radiotherapy and chemotherapy (29).
In the present study, we have shown that the transcription factor
C/EBPa, which is involved in cellular differentiation and cell cycle
control, is also a target of hypoxia regulation. This regulation could
play a role in cancer progression and resistance to therapy.
In the present study, we have shown that hypoxia caused a
robust reduction in C/EBPa mRNA and protein levels in both
T-47D and MCF-7 breast cancer cells. Therefore, we examined the
mechanisms responsible for the down-regulation of the C/EBPa
gene expression by hypoxia. One mechanism is the decreased
stability of C/EBPa mRNA in hypoxic cells. Previously, hypoxia has
been shown to reduce mRNA stability of other genes with different
half-lives such as MCP-1 (half-life of 35 minutes; ref. 30) and
endothelial nitric oxide synthase (half-life of 13 F 2 hours; ref. 31).
The second effect of hypoxia is a decrease in promoter activity,
which seems to be mediated by a HRE sequence and HIF-1a.
Indeed, both EMSA analysis and mutational functional studies led

Cancer Res 2008; 68: (7). April 1, 2008

us to focus on two putative responsive sequences called HRE1 and
HRE2. Binding of both sequences to nuclear proteins was increased
in hypoxia. Shift-Western blot analysis and antibody competition
experiments suggested that these sequences could bind to HIF-1a,
and this binding was shown to be disrupted in mutated HREs.
Mutation of HRE2 (GCGTCC), which is a conserved HRE, did not
reduce the effect of hypoxia on luciferase activity. However, when
HRE1 (an imperfect reverse HRE sequence) was mutated, the
negative effect of hypoxia was disrupted. This result shows that the
HRE1 sequence of the C/EBPa promoter, located between 522 and
527 bp upstream of the transcription start site, is responsible for
the HIF-1a–mediated down-regulation of C/EBPa in hypoxia.
Next, we investigated whether down-regulation of C/EBPa in
hypoxia could be prevented by knocking down HIF-1a with stealth
RNAi or with a siRNA plasmid targeted to HIF-1a. We found that in
cells where HIF-1a was silenced, hypoxia-induced down-regulation
of C/EBPa was completely inhibited. This finding confirms that
HIF-1a is responsible for the down-regulation of C/EBPa seen in
T-47D breast cancer cells cultured under hypoxia. Our results are in
agreement with previous studies in adipocytes and leukemic cells,
where hypoxia and desferrioxamine reduced C/EBPa levels (32, 33).
However, in those studies the contribution of HIF-1a was not
assessed.
To assess the relevance of the present data to breast cancer, we
examined 10 tumor samples from patients who had undergone
surgery for ductal breast carcinoma to determine C/EBPa and
hypoxia status. We found that C/EBPa is less expressed in highergrade tumors, which is in agreement with a recent study by Gery
et al. (7). Most importantly, colocalization of Glut-1 and C/EBPa
was not observed in any of the samples examined, except in one
sample in which the expression of C/EBPa was very low. Although
there are several limitations to this study due to the small sample
size, the fact that no colocalization of Glut-1 and C/EBPa was
observed is consistent with the hypothesis that hypoxia leads to
down-regulation of C/EBPa.
Hypoxia also altered the cellular distribution of C/EBPa in T-47D
cells and relocated this protein mainly to the cytosol. Both the
reduction in C/EBPa protein and its relocation to the cytosol could
act in concert to decrease the functional activity of this protein in
the nucleus. These observations seem to be particularly relevant in

Hypoxia Down-regulates C/EBPa

light of the study by Gery et al. (7). These authors showed that
C/EBPa was down-regulated in a large number of breast carcinoma samples compared with normal tissue. They further showed
that the localization of this factor shifted from a nuclear localization in normal epithelial cells to a mixed cytoplasmic and nuclear
localization in cancer cells. The extranuclear localization of
C/EBPa in T-47D cells driven by hypoxia suggests an inactive state
of this transcription factor. Moreover, it has been shown that hypoxia
leads to a dedifferentiated phenotype in ductal carcinoma in situ
and in breast cancer cell lines (16), a finding that is in line with
the reduction of C/EBPa expression shown in the present study.
C/EBPa induces growth arrest and terminal differentiation
in vitro and in vivo in various cells types, including breast cancer
cells (5–7, 34, 35). C/EBPa may also interact with p21WAF1/CIP1/sdi1 ,
an important regulatory protein, to bring about cell cycle arrest (4).
Interestingly, we have observed a decrease in p21 protein levels in
T-47D cells cultured under hypoxia.10 Because p21 is crucial for
the orderly progression of the cell cycle, one possible consequence
of its down-regulation by hypoxia is the modulation of cell
proliferation, which we have indeed observed in T-47D cells. These

results suggest that short-term hypoxia moderately favors cell
proliferation, and are in line with the down-regulation of the cell
cycle control factors C/EBPa and p21.
In conclusion, the findings of the present study show that
hypoxia leads to down-regulation of C/EBPa in breast cancer
cells by several mechanisms, including transcriptional repression
mediated by HIF-1a binding to a HRE in the C/EBPa promoter
and posttranscriptional effects such as reduced stability of C/EBPa
mRNA and altered cellular distribution of C/EBPa protein.
All these mechanisms can contribute to the decreased functional
activity of this transcription factor. The down-regulation of
C/EBPa in hypoxic regions of high-grade ductal breast carcinomas
indicates that this finding could have physiopathologic relevance,
and justifies further examination of C/EBPa as a possible
therapeutic target in breast cancer.
