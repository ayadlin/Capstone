ABSTRACT
Allopurinol is widely used for hyperuricemia and gouty arthritis, but is associated
with cutaneous adverse drug reactions (CADRs). Recently, HLA-B*58:01 allele was
identified as a strong genetic marker for allopurinol-induced CADRs in Han Chinese.
However, the magnitude of association and diagnosis value of HLA-B*58:01 in
allopurinol-induced CADRs remain inconclusive. To investigate this inconsistency,
we conducted a meta-analysis of 21 pharmacogenetic studies, including 551 patients
with allopurinol-induced CADRs, and 2,370 allopurinol-tolerant controls as well as
9,592 healthy volunteers. The summary OR for allopurinol-induced CADRs among
HLA-B*58:01 carriers was 82.77 (95% CI: 41.63 – 164.58, P < 10−5) and 100.87 (95%
CI: 63.91 – 159.21, P < 10−5) in matched and population based studies, respectively.
Significant results were also observed when stratified by outcomes and ethnicity.
Furthermore, the summary estimates for quantitative analysis of HLA-B*58:01 allele
carriers in allopurinol-induced CADRs screening were as follows: sensitivity, 0.93
(95% CI: 0.85 – 0.97); speciﬁcity, 0.89 (95% CI: 0.87 – 0.91); positive likelihood
ratio, 8.24 (95% CI: 6.92 – 9.81); negative likelihood ratio, 0.084 (95% CI: 0.039
– 0.179); and diagnostic odds ratio, 98.59 (95% CI: 43.31 – 224.41). The AUSROC
was 0.92 (95% CI: 0.89–0.94), indicating the high diagnostic performance. Our
results indicated that allopurinol–SCAR is strongly associated with HLA-B*58:01,
and HLA-B*58:01 is a highly speciﬁc and effective genetic marker for the detection
allopurinol-induced CADRs, especially for Asian descents.

is well tolerated with gastrointestinal discomfort being the
most frequent complaint. However, allopurinol causes
a variety of cutaneous adverse drug reactions (CADRs)
ranging from milder form, such as maculopapular eruption
(MPE), to severe cutaneous adverse reactions (SCARs)

INTRODUCTION
Allopurinol, a structural analog of hypoxanthine, is
an effective xanthine oxidase inhibitor that has been wildly
used as antihyperuricemic agent [1]. In general, allopurinol

including drug-induced hypersensitivity syndrome (HSS),
Stevens–Johnson syndrome (SJS) and toxic epidermal
necrolysis (TEN) [2]. Although SCARs rarely occur, the
mortality rate ranges from 5 - 10% in SJS, 10% in HSS,
and increases to 30 – 40% in TEN [2–4].
Allopurinol-induced CADRs is regarded as a
complex process with interaction between environmental
and genetic factors related to drug metabolism and
immune responses. Environmental factors such as
cigarette smoking, alcohol abuse, drug-drug interactions,
pre-existing diseases (e.g., diabetes, chronic kidney
disease), and viral infections have been already well
studied so far [5]. To investigate the relationship between
human leucocyte antigen (HLA) genetic markers and
CADRs induced by allopurinol, recent pharmacogenetic
studies have shown HLA-B*58:01 allele as the most
strong association signal for allopurinol-induced CADRs
[6–8]. However, inconsistent findings were subsequently
reported [9, 10]. Individual study may have failed to detect
difference due to inadequate statistical power, phenotypic
heterogeneity, multiple hypothesis testing, and publication
bias. Besides, accumulated evidences have been reported
in recent years and there is a need to reconcile these
data. Furthermore, HLA-B*58:01 genotyping is a costprohibitive test for routine clinical practice, which are
mainly used in medical research rather than in clinical
practice [11]. Moreover, uncertainty still persists about
the clinical performance of HLA-B*58:01 genotype
for diagnosing of SCARs caused by allopurinol. Here,
we conducted a comprehensive meta-analysis from all
eligible pharmacogenetic studies to assess the association
of HLA-B*58:01 allele in the development of allopurinolinduced CADRs and to evaluate the diagnosis value of
CADRs.

information on allopurinol exposure duration. Most
studies (except for the study by Ye et al [14] and study
by Zeng [15]) specified the diagnostic criteria for SJS and
TEN cases [29, 30]. The main study characteristics were
summarized in Supplementary Table S1. Additionally,
only the general population data from the study by Hung
et al [7] were used in the overall comparison [7] as for
sample overlapping.

Overall association of HLA-B*58:01 with
allopurinol-induced CADRs risk
Table 1 shows the summary of the meta-analysis for
HLA-B*58:01 and allopurinol-induced CADRs. Overall,
the HLA-B*58:01 allele showed a strong association
with the risk of allopurinol-induced CADRs in matched
studies (OR = 82.77, 95% CI: 41.63 – 164.58, P < 105
; Figure 1) and population-based studies (OR = 100.87,
95% CI: 63.91 – 159.21, P < 10-5; Figure 2). When only
the severe form of CADRs were considered, a significant
increased risks of allopurinol-induced SCARs for carrier
of the HLA-B*58:01 allele were detected for matched
studies and population-based studies with OR of 92.06
(95% CI: 59.54 – 142.32, P < 10-5) and 108.39 (95%
CI: 73.73 – 159.36, P < 10-5), respectively. In addition,
signiﬁcantly increased risk for SJS/TEN was observed
among studies using matched control (OR = 79.01, 95%
CI: 44.23 – 141.12, P < 10-5), and population-control
(OR = 106.48, 95% CI: 65.66 – 172.66, P < 10-5). When
all included studies were stratiﬁed based on ethnicity,
significantly increased risks of allopurinol-induced
CADRs among HLA-B*58:01 carrier were found both in
Asians and Caucasians (Table 1). For multiple testing, all
associations remain significant after Bonferroni correction.
Statistical amount of between-study heterogeneity was
found (I2 values > 50%); we therefore conducted a metaregression analysis which showed that the study size may
be the source of heterogeneity (P < 0.05). By contrast,
source of controls, study quality, age, sex, allopurinol
dosage and exposure duration were not correlated with
the overall ORs (P > 0.05). To further explore sources
of heterogeneity between individual studies, Galbraith
plot analyses were used and 2 studies were identified
(Supplementary Figure S2).
MPE and EEM have been considered to be
distinct from SJS/TEN, the overall association between
HLA-B*58:01 carriers with MPE and EEM is much
weaker than SCARs caused by allopurinol. Overall,
the random-effect OR of the HLA-B*58:01 for MPE
and EEM was 29.33 (95% CI: 5.89 – 145.98, P < 10-4;
Supplementary Figure S3) and 12.95 (95% CI: 2.30-72.85,
P = 0.004; Supplementary Figure S4), respectively.
Under recessive genetic model, we further analysed
the gene dosage effect of HLA-B*58:01 on -CADRs
induced by allopurinol. The distribution of HLA-B*58:01
genotypes among CADRs cases and tolerant controls

RESULTS
Literature selection and studies characteristics
The flow of our literature search is shown in
Supplementary Figure S1. We identified 308 records
after searching different databases. After reviewing the
title and abstracts, 287 records were excluded. After fulltext review, the remaining 21 studies [7–10, 12–28] were
included in our study, with 12,513 individuals in total,
including 551 patients with allopurinol-induced CADRs.
The 11,962 individuals without allopurinol-induced
CADRs were included in these studies as control groups,
which comprised 2,370 allopurinol-tolerant controls
from 16 matched studies and 9,592 healthy volunteers
or general populations from 13 studies. Most studies
were conducted among East Asian populations, 2 studies
examined individuals of white race [16, 24], and 1 studies
evaluated multi-ethnic populations [27]. Ten studies
reported the allopurinol dosages data [7, 9, 14, 15, 17, 20–
23, 28], while 9 studies [7, 9, 17, 20–23, 25, 28] provided

speciﬁc drug-gene interaction, and thus improves safety
before drug administration is a real challenge. Quantitative
synthesis of data from single study, meta-analysis with
sufﬁcient power is helpful to address this issue [31]. The
present meta-analysis of 21 pharmacogenetic studies,
involving 12,513 individuals provided evidence regarding
the casual relationship between HLA-B*58:01 carriers and
the development of allopurinol-related CADRs; while the
association of HLA-B*58:01 allele with with allopurinolinduced MPE or EEM was much weaker.
We observed significant heterogeneity between
studies and conducted subgroup analyses and metaregression to investigate the potential sources. In
fact, ethnicity was identified as a potential source of
heterogeneity and the effect estimates in Asians (OR range
from 73 to 152) was much stronger than that in white
populations (OR range from 39 to 64). Thus, differences
in genetic background could influence the response to
allopurinol. Indeed, the HLA-B*58:01 allelic frequency

DISCUSSION
Because of the rareness of serious adverse drug
reactions, pharmacogenetic studies were underpowered to
detect modest differences on small sample sizes. Obtaining
adequate numbers of cases with adverse drug reactions for

is much higher in Asians (10 – 15%) than Europeans (1
– 3%) [32]. Due to limited allopurinol-induced CADRs
patients investigated in Caucasians, it’s possible that
different effect estimates among ethnic groups might
arise simply by chance as for insufficient statistical
power. Therefore, more studies with large sample size
are warranted to validate the effect of HLA-B*58:01 on
allopurinol-induced CADRs among difference ethnic
populations. To check the influence of individual study,
sensitivity analysis was performed and showed robust
associations even when the largest study was removed.
The area under ROC serves as a global measure
of diagnostic performance. According to the suggested
guideline for interpretation of area under ROC [33],
HLA-B*58:01 had high diagnostic accuracy (0.9 <
AUC < 1) for detection of allopurinol-induced CADRs.
The DOR combines sensitivity and speciﬁcity as one
indicator for diagnostic accuracy [34]. In overall analysis,
HLA-B*58:01 also showed a high diagnostic performance
with a DOR of 90.12. The likelihood ratios are more

clinically meaningful indicators [35]. The summary PLR
was 8.24 suggesting about 8.3 times higher chance of a
allopurinol-induced CADR case to be identified from a
positive result for HLA-B*58:01 testing, which was not
high enough to be used as a robust diagnostic indicator
of allopurinol-induced CADRs. While a negative result
for HLA-B*58:01 screening means allopurinol-tolerant
control only have 8.6% of probability to develop
CADRs. These values indicated that a negative result of
HLA-B*58:01 allele could be used as a justiﬁcation to
deny allopurinol-induced CADRs.
As lacks of sufficient evidence about the costeffectiveness of HLA-B*58:01 typing, and the conflicting
results reported, screening HLA-B*58:01 before
allopurinol administration is still a remaining issue.
Recently, Jung et al. [6] reported that genetic screening
test could help to identify HLA–B58:01–positive patients
and thus improve safety of allopurinol treatment. More
recently, a large cohort study further demonstrated the
usefulness of prospective HLA-B*58:01 genotyping

for prevention of SCARs induced by allopurinol [36].
Furthermore, two cost-effectiveness studies conducted
among Koreans and Thais indicated that HLA-B*58:01
screening before allopurinol treatment is a more cost
effective intervention than benzbromarone or febuxostat as
an alternative medication [37, 38]. However, Dong et al.
reported that allopurinol treatment for chronic gout without
HLA-B*58:01 genetic tests remain the optimal strategy
from a cost–effectiveness perspective in Singapore [39].
With the development of new technologies and decreasing

cost of genetic testing, HLA screening could implement
widely and cost effectively in near future.
The detailed pathogenesis mechanisms of CADRs
caused by allopurinol remain unknown. Accumulated
evidence suggested that T-cell-mediated immunologic
response play a central role in CADRs. Through
interactions with class I HLA-restricted antigen-presenting
cells (APC) and T-cell receptor, CD8-positive cytotoxic
T cells believed to trigger an immunologic reaction of
SCARs [40]. In vitro study by Lin et al. demonstrates

MATERIALS AND METHODS

that only APC with HLA-B*58:01 allele present strong
cytotoxicity against CD8 + T lymphocytes collected from
patients with allopurinol–caused CADRs [41].
Some limitations of the study must be addressed
to prevent misinterpretation of our ﬁndings. First,
substantial heterogeneity was detected and study-level
data did not allow us to further explore potential sources
of heterogeneity. Second, most cases of allopurinolinduced CADRs were of Asian origin, and results from
Caucasian populations may be biased. Third, only singlefactor estimates were available and we failed to provide
results with further adjustment of potential confounders.
For stratiﬁed analyses investigating HLA-B*58:01 with
MPE and EEM, very few patients were available. Thus,
selection bias is inevitable and the results may be easily
over inﬂated. Large studies are needed to address these
issues.
Taken together, our meta-analysis from 21
pharmacogenetic studies summarizes the strong correlation
of allopurinol-related CADRs with HLA-B*58:01 allele,
especially among Asians. Our findings suggested that
screening for HLA-B*58:01 may be helpful in allopurinolinduced CADRs detection because of its high level of
diagnostic accuracy.

Data sources and search strategy
Pharmacogenetic association studies published
before July 2016, on HLA-B*58:01 and CADRs in patients
treated with allopurinol were sought by computer-based
searches, scanning of the reference lists of all relevant
studies and review articles, hand searching of relevant
journals. Systematic search of the literature in EMBASE,
PubMed, clinicaltrials.gov, The Cochrane Library,
Web of Knowledge, MEDLINE, IPA (International
Pharmaceutical Abstracts), CINAHL (Cumulative Index
to Nursing and Allied Health Literature), and HuGENet
(Human Genome Epidemiology Network) used keywords
relating to the HLA-B (e.g., “Human leukocyte antigen”)
and allopurinol in combination with CADRs (e.g.,
“drug adverse reaction”, “maculopapular exanthema”,
“hypersensitivity syndrome”, “Stevens Johnson
syndrome”, “toxic epidermal necrolysis”, and “erythema
exudativum multiforme”). No restriction was imposed on
the language and the year of publication. Furthermore,
citations in the retrieved articles were hand-searched to
identify additional relevant reports. The titles and abstracts

topic of interest.

of heterogeneity was undertaken by meta-regression
analysis using ethnicity, sample size, source of controls,
age, sex, allopurinol dosage and exposure duration as
covariates [46]. Subgroup analyses by ethnicity (Asians,
and Caucasians) and clinical outcomes (SCARs, SJS/TEN,
MPE, and EEM) were also performed to seek for potential
sources of between-study heterogeneity. Furthermore,
the Galbraith plot was used to identify the outliers
contributing toward heterogeneity.
Sensitivity, specificity, diagnostic odds ratio (DOR),
positive likelihood ratio (PLR), and negative likelihood
ratio (NLR) with corresponding 95% confidence intervals
(CI) were calculated for each matched study. Metaanalysis of diagnostic test evaluations was performed
using standard methods under random-effects model [47].
Hierarchical summary receiver operating characteristic
(HSROC) curves were also plotted to graphically present
the results [48]. The area under the curve (AUC) results
are considered excellent for AUC values of 0.9 – 1.0, good
for values of 0.8 – 0.9, fair for values of 0.7 – 0.8, and
poor for values of 0.6 – 0.7.
To assess the stability of results, one-way sensitivity
analyses were performed by removing each individual
study in turn from the total and reanalysing the remainder.
Small study effects, such as publication bias, were
assessed by inspecting the funnel plots for asymmetry and
Egger’s linear regression test, as well as Deeks’ test [49–
51]. Since the P-values of less than 0.05 were considered
signiﬁcant, alpha was ﬁrstly set at 0.05, and the HolmBonferroni method was used to control the type I error in
multiple comparisons with an alpha of 0.0056 (0.05/9).
Statistical analyses were carried out using the STATA
software version 11.0 (Stata Corporation, College Station,
TX, USA).

Selection criteria and quality assessment
Two investigators (R.W and Y.J.C) independently
assessed abstracts and titles retrieved from the
comprehensive searches for eligible study. Studies
included in the current meta-analysis had to meet all
the following criteria: (a) original papers containing
independent data, (b) investigated the relationship between
HLA-B*58:01 and allopurinol-induced CADRs, (c)
reported sufficient data for estimating an odds ratio (OR)
with 95% confidence interval (95% CI), sensitivity and
specificity. Exclusion criteria were as follows: (a) caseonly studies, (b) duplicated studies using the same case
series, and (c) reviews, editorials, comments, reports from
scientiﬁc sessions or discussions. A procedure known as
‘Newcastle–Ottawa Scale (NOS)’ has been used to assess
the quality of included observational studies. Details are
published elsewhere [42].

Data extraction
Information was carefully extracted from all eligible
publications independently by the two reviewers according
to a ﬁxed protocol. First author, study design, year of
publication, ethnicity, eligibility criteria, diagnosis and
phenotypic definition for CADRs patient demographics,
CADRs type, dosage of allopurinol and duration of use,
genotyping method, HLA-B*58:01 status among cases and
controls, results of Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) in
the control group, and sensitivity and specificity data were
collected from eligible studies. Review reports from the
two were then compared to identify any inconsistency, and
differences were resolved by further discussion among all
authors.

The data from each study was divided into two

CADRs vs. allopurinol-tolerant patients; allopurinolinduced CADRs vs. healthy controls without allopurinol
exposure or subjects obtained from the population
database. The strength of the association between the
presence of HLA-B*58:01 in at least 1 allele [43] and
allopurinol-induced CADRs was estimated using crude
odds ratios (ORs), with the corresponding 95% confidence
intervals (CIs). The heterogeneity across individual
studies was measured by the Cochran’s Q test and the
inconsistency index (I2) [44]. A random-effects model,
which is usually more conservative, was used to calculate
the pooled ORs [45]. Quantitative assessment of sources
