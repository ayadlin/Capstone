invasion, and metastasis, which is required for proper nourishment
and removal of metabolic wastes from tumor sites (1–3). Advances
in this field are leading to novel treatments for many cancers (4).
Angiogenesis is initiated by cell proliferation and migration in
response to chemotactic agents, such as vascular endothelial
growth factor (VEGF), which is expressed and generated by most
cancer cell types and is a potent proangiogenic factor that
functions in tumor vascular development (5). VEGF exerts its
biological effects by binding to its receptor tyrosine kinases,
expressed on endothelial cells. The biologically relevant VEGF
signaling events are mediated mainly via VEGF receptor 2
(VEGFR2; ref. 6). Activation of VEGFR2 leads to the activation of
various downstream signal transduction proteins, including
extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK), protein kinase C, Src
family kinase, focal adhesion kinase (7, 8), and phosphoinositide
3-kinase/AKT/eNOS pathway. Raf/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)/ERK kinase (MEK)/ERK signaling pathway mediated
by VEGF mainly regulates cellular proliferation and survival and
has been the focus of cancer chemotherapy because of its relevance
in tumor angiogenesis and carcinogenesis (9).
Cellular functions of the Rho family of small GTPases, including
RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc42, have been shown to regulate a vast
spectrum of biological functions, including cell actin cytoskeleton,
cell polarity, and migration (10, 11), which are all involved in tumor
angiogenesis and metastasis (12). In addition, Rho GTPases have
also been implicated in the control of gene transcription (13) and
in cell cycle progression, cell growth, and proliferation (14, 15).
Because Rho proteins are key regulators of angiogenesis, drugs
targeting Rho GTPase signaling pathways are potential pharmacologic and therapeutic agents (10).
A variety of polyphenolic substances, particularly those present in
dietary and medical plants, are hypothesized to exhibit a preventive
effect on cancer (16). Morelloflavone is a bioactive biflavonoid
from Garcinia dulcis, which is a traditional herb medicine belonging
to the Guttiferae family and is widely distributed in Thailand,
Philippines, and other Southeast Asian countries. It has been
documented that morelloflavone shows significant antiviral activity
against HIV-1 in phytohemagglutinin-stimulated primary human
peripheral blood mononuclear cells (17), exerts inhibitory function
in human secretory phospholipase A2, and ameliorates 12-Otetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate–induced ear inflammation and
carrageenan-induced paw edema in mice (18). However, whether
morelloflavone has any functions in tumor angiogenesis and cancer
prevention has not been reported yet.
In this study, we examined how morelloflavone inhibited
tumor angiogenesis by targeting key signaling pathways and genes.
Our results show that morelloflavone could significantly inhibit

Abstract
Morelloflavone, a biflavonoid extracted from Garcinia dulcis,
has shown antioxidative, antiviral, and anti-inflammatory
properties. However, the function and the mechanism of this
compound in cancer treatment and tumor angiogenesis have
not been elucidated to date. In this study, we postulated that
morelloflavone might have the ability to inhibit angiogenesis,
the pivotal step in tumor growth, invasiveness, and metastasis.
We showed that morelloflavone could inhibit vascular
endothelial growth factor (VEGF)–induced cell proliferation,
migration, invasion, and capillary-like tube formation of
primary cultured human umbilical vascular endothelial cells
in a dose-dependent manner. Morelloflavone effectively
inhibited microvessel sprouting of endothelial cells in the
mouse aortic ring assay and the formation of new blood
microvessels induced by VEGF in the mouse Matrigel plug
assay. Furthermore, morelloflavone inhibited tumor growth
and tumor angiogenesis of prostate cancer cells (PC-3) in
xenograft mouse tumor model in vivo, suggesting that
morelloflavone inhibited tumorigenesis by targeting angiogenesis. To understand the underlying mechanism of morelloflavone on the inhibitory effect of tumor growth and
angiogenesis, we showed that morelloflavone could inhibit
the activation of both RhoA and Rac1 GTPases but have little
effect on the activation of Cdc42 GTPase. Additionally,
morelloflavone inhibited the phosphorylation and activation
of Raf/mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signalregulated kinase (ERK) kinase/ERK pathway kinases without
affecting VEGF receptor 2 activity. Together, our results
indicate that morelloflavone exerts antiangiogenic action by
targeting the activation of Rho-GTPases and ERK signaling
pathways. These findings are the first to reveal the novel
functions of morelloflavone in tumor angiogenesis and its
molecular basis for the anticancer action. [Cancer Res

Morelloflavone Inhibits Tumor Angiogenesis
in 1 mL ECGM (supplemented with 0.5% FBS and 4 ng/mL VEGF) with
various concentrations of morelloflavone. After 4 to 6 h of incubation at
37jC, 5% CO2, endothelial cell tubular structure formation was quantified
by calculating the tube length of high-power fields (HPF; 200) with
Olympus inverted microscope, and inhibition percentage was expressed
using untreated wells as 100%.
Aortic ring assay. Aortic ring assay was performed as previously
described with some modifications (21, 22). Forty-eight–well plates were
covered with 100 AL Matrigel (supplemented with growth factor) at 4jC and
incubated at 37jC, 5% CO2 for 30 min. Aortas isolated from mice were
cleaned of periadventitial fat and connective tissues and cut into 1- to
1.5-mm-long rings. After being rinsed five times with endothelial cell–based
medium, the aortas were placed on the Matrigel-covered wells and covered
with another 100 AL Matrigel. After these aortic rings were cultured for 24 h,
the medium was replaced with or without morelloflavone. After 4 d of
incubation, the microvessel growth was quantified by taking photographs
with Olympus inverted microscope. After images were acquired, the
outgrowth area was delineated and measured with the Pro Plus software
(Media Cybernetics).
Matrigel plug assay. Matrigel plug assay was performed as described by
Yi and colleagues (22). In brief, Matrigel (0.5 mL/plug) with no VEGF or
morelloflavone, VEGF (4 ng/mL) but no morelloflavone, and VEGF (4 ng/
mL) and different concentrations of morelloflavone in liquid form at 4jC,
respectively, was injected s.c. in the midventral abdominal region of 5- to
6-wk-old C57BL/6 mice (n = 5 each group). After 7 d, the mice were
sacrificed and the plugs were removed. Each group had four to five Matrigel
plugs. The Matrigel plugs were fixed and embedded with paraffin. The 5-Am
sections were stained with H&E staining. The number of erythrocyte-filled
blood vessels in HPF (200) was counted (plug number, 4–5).
Xenograft mouse model. Xenograft mouse model assay was performed
as described by Yi and colleagues (23). The 5- to 6-wk-old severe combined
immunodeficient (SCID) male mice (ordered from NIH) weighing f20 g
were divided with five mice per group. PC-3 cells were s.c. injected (2  106
per mouse) into the mice. After the tumors had established (f50 mm3), the
mice were s.c. injected with or without 8 mg/kg morelloflavone everyday.
The mice body weight and tumor sizes were recorded everyday and the
tumor sizes were determined by Vernier caliper measurements and
calculated as length  width  height. After 15 d, mice with tumors not
greater than 1.5 cm in diameter were sacrificed.
Histology and immunohistochemistry. Tumors were removed and fixed
with HistoChoice MB (Molecular Biology) tissue fixative (Amresco) and
embedded with paraffin. Specific blood vessel staining was performed on the
5-Am sections with blood vessel staining kit (von Willebrand factor, Chemicon
International). Images were taken with Zeiss Axioskop 40 photomicroscope.
The number of blood vessels was counted (plug number, 4–5).
GST-PBD pull-down assay. GTPase activation assay in the cells was
performed by GST-PAK1 or GST-RBP pull-down assays as described by Guo
and colleagues (24). Briefly, HUVECs were starved overnight with 0.1% FBS
medium. Cells were washed and pretreated with different concentration
of morelloflavone (5, 10, and 20 Amol/L) for 30 min and then stimulated
by 50 ng/mL VEGF for 1 h. After that, cells were washed with cold PBS
and lysed on the dish in radioimmunoprecipitation assay (RIPA) buffer.
About 500 Ag protein extracts were used for various pull-down assays. GTPbound Rac1 or Cdc42 was pulled down using the GST-PBD of PAK1
immobilized on glutathione beads. GTP-bound Rho was pulled down using
the GST-RBP immobilized on glutathione beads. The amount of active
Rac1, Cdc42, and Rho (GTP-bound form) was detected by Western blot
using specific antibodies against Rac1, Cdc42, and Rho (Santa Cruz
Biotechnology).
Western immunoblotting. To determine the effects of morelloflavone
on VEGF-dependent Raf/MEK/ERK pathway phosphorylation, HUVECs
were first starved with 0.1% FBS medium for 12 to 14 h. After being washed
with new fresh medium, cells were pretreated with or without different
concentrations of morelloflavone for 30 min and then stimulated with
50 ng/mL VEGF 20 min for ERK pathway phosphorylation. The whole-cell
extracts were prepared by RIPA buffer supplemented with different kinds of
proteinase inhibitors. Specific antibodies were used for different Western

VEGF-stimulated endothelial cell proliferation, migration, invasion,
tube formation, and tumor angiogenesis by targeting Rho family
proteins, especially the activation of Rac1 and RhoA activities, and
by interfering with the Raf/MEK/ERK pathway, leading to the
suppression of tumor growth and tumor angiogenesis.

Materials and Methods
Cell lines, cell culture, and reagents. Morelloflavone was kindly
provided by Dr. Fujise, 98% by TLC/high-performance liquid chromatography. A 10 mmol/L solution of morelloflavone was prepared in DMSO,
stored at 20jC and protected from light, and then diluted as needed
concentrations in cell culture medium. Primary human umbilical vascular
endothelial cells (HUVEC) were a kind gift from Dr. Xinli Wang
(Cardiothoracic Surgery Division, Michael E. DeBakey Department of
Surgery, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX; refs. 19, 20). HUVECs
were cultured in endothelial cell growth medium (ECGM):M199 medium
(Life Technologies, Invitrogen) supplemented with 20% fetal bovine serum
(FBS; Hyclone Laboratories), 20 Ag/mL bovine endothelial cell growth factor
(Roche), 0.1 mg/mL heparin (Sigma), 15 mmol/L HEPES buffer, penicillin
(50 IU/L), streptomycin (50 mg/L), NaHCO3 (44 mmol/L), and 50 Ag/mL
amphotericin B at 37jC under a humidified 95%:5% (v/v) mixture of air and
CO2. The human prostate cancer cell line (PC-3) was purchased from the
American Type Culture Collection and cultured in RPMI 1640 supplemented
with 10% FBS. VEGF165 was obtained from NIH Experimental Branch.
Matrigel was purchased from BD Biosciences, and mitomycin C was
ordered from Roche.
Cell viability assay. HUVECs and PC-3 cells (2  104 per well) were
treated with or without VEGF (4 ng/mL) and different concentrations of
morelloflavone for 24 h. Cell viability was determined by 3-(4,5dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium, inner salt (MTS) method, following the manual of CellTiter
96 Aqueous One Solution Cell Proliferation assay (Promega) with
VERSAmax microplate reader (Molecular Devices).
Flow cytometry fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis. HUVECs
(1  106) were treated with different concentrations of morelloflavone for
24 h and then collected and performed in a fluorescence-activated cell
sorting (FACS) flow cytometer (BD Sciences) with propidium iodide
staining. The percentages of cell population at G0-G1 and G2-M phases
were observed.
Migration assay. HUVECs were allowed to grow into full confluence in
six-well plates precoated with 0.1% gelatin (Sigma) and then incubated with
10 Ag/mL mitomycin C for 2 h to inactivate HUVEC proliferation. After that,
cells were wounded by pipette tips and washed with PBS. ECGM
supplemented with 0.5% FBS was added into well with or without
4 ng/mL VEGF and different concentrations of morelloflavone. Images
were taken after about 8 to 10 h of incubation at 37jC, 5% CO2. The
migrated cells were quantified by manual counting and percentage
inhibition was expressed using untreated wells at 100%. Three independent
experiments were performed.
Transwell migration assay. The Transwell (Corning, Inc.) was coated
with 0.1% gelatin for 30 min in cell incubator. The bottom chambers
of Transwell were filled with ECGM with 0.5% FBS supplemented with
4 ng/mL VEGF, and the top chambers were seeded inactivated 4  104
cells per well HUVECs (pretreated with mitomycin C) in 100 AL ECGM
(0.5% FBS) plus different concentrations of morelloflavone. After 8 to 10 h of
migration, the cells on the top surface of the membrane (nonmigrated cells)
were scraped with a cotton swab and the cells spreading on the bottom
sides of the membrane (invasive cells) were fixed with cold 4%
paraformaldehyde for 30 min. After that, those migrated cells were stained
with hematoxylin. Images were taken using Olympus inverted microscope
and invasive cells were quantified by manual counting. Percentage
inhibition of invasive cells was quantified and expressed based on untreated
control wells.
Tube formation assay. Matrigel (growth factor reduced) was thawed at
4jC, and each well of prechilled 24-well plates was coated with 50 AL
Matrigel and incubated at 37jC for 45 min. HUVECs (4  104) were added

Activator protein-1 luciferase reporter assay. Luciferase reporter
assay was described by Mitchell and colleagues (25). 293T cells were seeded
in 24-well plates with DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS. After cells were
60% confluent, reporter gene constructs were transfected using Lipofectamine reagent according to the manufacturer’s protocol (Invitrogen).
Luciferase activity of protein lysates was measured following the
manufacturer’s protocol (Luciferase Assay System, Promega). To normalize
the differences of transfection efficiencies, all cells were transfected with
pRSV-h-gal control vector (Promega). h-Galactosidase levels were then
measured following the manufacturer’s protocol (Galacto-Light Plus). All
luciferase experiments were performed in triplicate and repeated thrice.

morelloflavone in vitro, we examined the inhibitory effects of
morelloflavone on cell viability in both HUVECs and PC-3 prostate
cancer cells using MTS assay. Morelloflavone significantly inhibited
VEGF-induced endothelial cell viability from 5 Amol/L and with
half-maximal inhibition at 20 Amol/L (Fig. 1B). However, under
normal HUVEC culture condition (20% serum), morelloflavone can
significantly inhibit cell viability at a much higher concentration
with a half-maximal inhibition at 80 Amol/L (Fig. 1C), indicating
that morelloflavone is more effective in angiogenesis disease
condition. As a control, we also performed the cell viability assays
with culture medium containing 0.5% DMSO. Our data indicate
that 0.5% DMSO has no effect on cell growth, proliferation, and
viability (data not shown). To examine whether morelloflavone
regulated cell cycle progression, we performed FACS and the result
revealed that morelloflavone induced a depletion of cells in
the G0-G1 phase, from 82.06% to 50.23%, and a concomitant
accumulation of cells in G2-M phase, from 12.57% to 29.99%
(Table 1). These data suggested that morelloflavone could arrest
endothelial cell proliferation. Furthermore, we examined the
inhibitory effect of morelloflavone on human prostate cancer cells
and the results showed that the half-maximal inhibition of PC-3
cells was over 100 Amol/L (Fig. 1D), suggesting that morelloflavone
is more effective in regulating the proliferation of HUVECs than
that of cancer cells.

Results
Morelloflavone is more effective in inhibiting cell viability
in HUVECs than in PC-3 cancer cells. Morelloflavone is a
bioactive biflavonoid from G. dulcis with a molecular weight of
556.4732 g/mol (Fig. 1A). To assess the antiangiogenic property of

Morelloflavone Inhibits Tumor Angiogenesis

Figure 2. Morelloflavone inhibits
VEGF-induced migration, invasion, and
tubular structure formation of endothelial
cells. A, morelloflavone inhibits HUVEC
migration. HUVECs were allowed to grow
into full confluence in six-well plates and
inactivated with 10 Ag/mL mitomycin C for
2 h. Cells were wounded with pipette and
treated with or without 4 ng/mL VEGF and
different concentrations of morelloflavone
in ECGM supplemented with 0.5% FBS.
After incubation, the migrated cells
were quantified by manual counting.
B, morelloflavone inhibits the invasion
of HUVEC. HUVECs were seeded in
the upper chamber of Transwell and
treated with different concentrations of
morelloflavone. The bottom chamber was
filled with ECGM supplemented with VEGF.
After about 8 to 10 h, the invasive HUVECs
passed through the membrane and were
quantified by counting the cells that
migrated onto the membrane.
C, morelloflavone inhibits VEGF-induced
tube formation of HUVECs. HUVECs were
placed in the 24-well plates coated with
Matrigel at the density of 4  104 per well.
After 4 to 6 h, cells were fixed and
tubular structure was quantified by
manual counting of HPFs (200).
Columns, mean from three different

*, P < 0.05; **, P < 0.01 versus VEGF alone.

Morelloflavone inhibits vessel sprouting ex vivo and
angiogenesis in vivo. To confirm that morelloflavone inhibits
angiogenesis ex vivo, we examined the effect of the compound on
the sprouting of microvessel from aortic rings. As shown in Fig. 3A,
growth factors in Matrigel can dramatically induce microvessel
sprouting, whereas addition of morelloflavone significantly
antagonizes microvessel sprouting using the aortic ring assay. At
5 Amol/L, morelloflavone can inhibit almost all microvessel
sprouting in the assays comparing with the control group (Fig. 3A).
To determine the effects of morelloflavone on VEGF-induced
angiogenesis in vivo, we performed the mouse Matrigel plug assay
to analyze how morelloflavone regulated VEGF-induced angiogenesis in the presence or absence of morelloflavone (2 and 10 Amol/L,
respectively) using 5- to 6-week-old C57BL/6 mice. After 7 days, the
Matrigel plugs were removed. The plugs containing VEGF alone
appeared dark red after being fixed (Fig. 2B, VEGF). The vessels
were abundantly filled with intact RBCs, indicating the formation
of a functional vasculature inside the Matrigel via angiogenesis
induced by VEGF. In contrast, the color of Matrigel plugs
containing VEGF plus morelloflavone groups, especially the group
with 10 Amol/L morelloflavone, was significantly pale, indicating
less blood vessel formation (Fig. 2B, VEGF + MF). The number of
neovessels was analyzed and quantified after being H&E stained
(Fig. 3C). Morelloflavone at 10 Amol/L strongly inhibited the vessel
number and the formation of microvessels. Together, these results
indicated that morelloflavone was capable of suppressing VEGFinduced neovessel formation in vivo.
Morelloflavone inhibits tumor angiogenesis and tumor
growth in vivo. Tumor angiogenesis provides oxygen, nutrients,

Morelloflavone inhibits VEGF-induced migration, invasion,
and capillary structure formation of endothelial cells. Cell
migration is critical for endothelial cell to form blood vessels in
angiogenesis and thus is necessary for tumor growth and
metastasis. The effects of morelloflavone on the chemotactic
motility of HUVECs were measured by wound-healing migration
assay and Transwell cell invasion assay. As shown in Fig. 2,
morelloflavone inhibits VEGF-induced HUVEC migration in a
concentration-dependent manner. Morelloflavone significantly
inhibited HUVEC migration at 1 Amol/L in scratching cell assays
(Fig. 2A), whereas the compound inhibited HUVEC invasion at
10 Amol/L in Transwell assays (Fig. 2B). Although angiogenesis is
a very complex process, tube formation of endothelial cells is one
of the key steps (26). To examine the potential effects of
morelloflavone on the tubular structure formation of endothelial
cells, we investigated how morelloflavone affects HUVEC tube
formation using two-dimensioned Matrigel assay. When HUVECs
were placed on the growth factor–reduced Matrigel, elongated
and robust tube-like structures were formed after incubation in
the presence of VEGF (Fig. 2C). The ability of endothelial cells to
form tubular structures was assessed in the presence or absence
of different concentrations of morelloflavone by calculating the
length of tubes with an inverted photomicroscope. As shown in
Fig. 2C, 10 Amol/L morelloflavone inhibited 50% tube formation
of HUVECs on Matrigel and 50 Amol/L morelloflavone can
completely inhibited the formation of tubular structures. These
results showed that morelloflavone could block VEGF-induced
in vitro angiogenesis by inhibiting cell migration, invasion, and
tube formation.

structure formation mainly through activation of its cell surface
receptor KDR/Flk (VEGFR2; refs. 6, 28). To understand the
molecular mechanism of morelloflavone-mediated antiangiogenic
properties, we examined whether different concentrations of
morelloflavone could inhibit the activation of VEGFR2 using
HTScan VEGFR2 kinase assay kit according to the suggested
methods (Cell Signaling Technology and Perkin-Elmer Life
Sciences). We found that morelloflavone had no effect on VEGFR2
activation up to 10 Amol/L (Fig. 5A), suggesting that morelloflavone may inhibit angiogenesis by regulating downstream
signaling molecules of VEGFR2.
Previous reports have suggested that VEGF-induced endothelial
cell migration is mediated by many signaling molecules, including
the Rho family of small GTPases (12, 29). To test whether
morelloflavone exerted antiangiogenic actions through inhibition
of Rho GTPases, we examined how morelloflavone regulated the
activation of RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc42 by glutathione S-transferase
(GST) fusion protein pull-down assays using specific GST fusion
protein-binding domains for activated small GTPases (GTP-bound
forms), respectively. As shown in Fig. 5B, morelloflavone could
significantly reduce the amounts of active RhoA and Rac1
GTPases in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 5B). On the other
hand, morelloflavone had little effect on the activation of Cdc42
(Fig. 5B). Half-maximal effects were obtained at f5 Amol/L.
Together, these data suggest that the inhibitory effects of
morelloflavone on the activation of RhoA and Rac1 GTPases might
contribute to the antiangiogenic effects of the compound in
HUVECs, especially the migration and invasion of HUVECs.
Morelloflavone inhibits the ERK signaling pathway in
endothelial cells. The Raf/MEK/ERK pathway is well known to

and main routes for tumor growth, invasiveness, and metastasis
and acts as a rate-limiting step in tumor progression (27). To
determine the effect of morelloflavone on tumor angiogenesis and
tumor growth at nontoxic dosage, we use a xenograft mouse
prostate tumor model. PC-3 prostate cancer cells were injected
(2  106 per mouse) into the 5- to 6-week-old SCID male mice.
After the tumors had established (f50 mm3), the mice were
injected with or without 8 mg/kg/d morelloflavone everyday. As
shown in Fig. 4A, tumors in control group increased from 51.18 F
2.24 to 1,143.93 F 75.60 mm3, whereas tumors in morelloflavonetreated group increased only from 53.80 F 1.24 to 237.40 F 26.75
mm3. The average weight of tumors from the control group was
0.272 F 0.166 g, whereas the average weight in morelloflavonetreated group was only 0.116 F 0.183 g (Fig. 4B), suggesting that
morelloflavone strongly inhibited tumor growth in xenograft
mouse prostate tumor model. To further investigate whether
morelloflavone inhibited tumor angiogenesis, we stained the solid
tumor sections with blood vessel staining kit. Our results indicated
that the average number of blood vessel in control group was
18.60 F 1.47/HPF, whereas the average blood vessel number in
morelloflavone-treated group was only 8.6 F 0.90/HPF (Fig. 4C),
indicating that morelloflavone significantly inhibited tumor
angiogenesis. However, morelloflavone (8 mg/kg/d) had little effect
on body weight at the concentration tested in the xenograft mouse
prostate tumor model (Fig. 4D), suggesting little toxicity of the
compound at the tested concentration. The observed mouse body
weight decrease in control group was probably due to the tumor
burden compared with the morelloflavone-treated group.

Morelloflavone Inhibits Tumor Angiogenesis

Figure 4. Morelloflavone inhibits tumor
angiogenesis and tumor growth in vivo.
A, morelloflavone inhibits solid cancer
growth in xenograft prostate cancer mouse
model. Prostate cancer cells (PC-3) were
injected (2  106 per mouse) into the
5- to 6-wk-old SCID male mice. After the
tumors had established (f50 mm3), the
mice were injected with or without
8 mg/kg/d morelloflavone. After 15 d, mice
were sacrificed and tumors were removed
and photographed. Tumor sizes in control
group and morelloflavone group were
calculated and shown in A. Tumors in
control group increased from 51.18 F 2.24
to 1,143.93 F 75.60 mm3, whereas
tumors in morelloflavone-treated group
increased only from 53.80 F 1.24 to
237.40 F 26.75 mm3. B, solid tumors in
morelloflavone-treated group were
significantly smaller than the control group.
The average weight of tumors from
control group was 0.272 F 0.166 g,
whereas that of morelloflavone-treated
group was 0.116 F 0.183 g. C, effects of
morelloflavone on tumor angiogenesis in
xenograft mouse model. Solid tumors were
fixed with HistoChoice MB tissue fixative
and embedded with paraffin. The 5-Am
sections were stained with specific blood
vessel staining kit and the blood vessel
number was calculated. The average
vessel number in control group was
18.60 F 1.47/HPF (magnification, 200),
whereas the average blood vessel number
in morelloflavone-treated group was
8.6 F 0.90/HPF. D, morelloflavone has
little effect on mouse body weight. No
significant difference between
morelloflavone-treated group (8 mg/kg/d)
and the control group. Columns, mean

Discussion

be involved in endothelial cell proliferation and cell survival,
important in angiogenesis. To investigate whether morelloflavone
could suppress the activation of ERK cascade in tumor
angiogenesis, we examined the phosphorylation and activation
of the protein kinases and transcription factors involved in ERK
signaling pathway (Fig. 5C and D). Our results indicated
that morelloflavone at concentration of 10 Amol/L could
significantly inhibit the phosphorylation of protein kinases
involved in the activation of ERK signaling pathway induced by
VEGF, including pSer338-c-Raf, pSer217/221-MEK1/2, and pThr202/
Tyr204-pERK1/2 (Fig. 5C). All these kinases can be down-regulated
by morelloflavone with a concentration-dependent manner (Fig.
5C). The downstream protein kinase of ERK, p90RSK, was also
significantly inhibited by morelloflavone in a concentrationdependent manner (Fig. 5C), suggesting that morelloflavone
exerted its antiangiogenic activity by targeting ERK-regulated
downstream gene expression. To further confirm the transcriptional regulation of morelloflavone on ERK-mediated gene
transcription, we examined how morelloflavone affected the
activation of activator protein-1 (AP-1), a key downstream
transcription factor of MAPK pathway in cancer development
and angiogenesis (30). Our results showed that 5 Amol/L
morelloflavone could strongly decrease the transcriptional activity
of AP-1 in the AP-1 luciferase reporter assays (Fig. 5D), indicating
that morelloflavone can inhibit the ERK-mediated AP-1 transcriptional activity in endothelial cells.

In recent years, substantial effort has been dedicated to
identifying anticancer agents that can be used to either prevent
insurgence of primary tumors or prevent tumor relapse. Current
interest is focusing on the beneficial health effects of phytochemicals (e.g., flavonoids; refs. 31, 32) because this kind of plant
polyphenols has been found to influence some steps in cancer
angiogenesis (31) beyond their traditional use. Morelloflavone is a
bioactive biflavonoid from G. dulcis; however, little information is
known about its functions in tumor angiogenesis and tumor
growth. In this study, we report the novel biological functions of
morelloflavone as an inhibitor of tumor angiogenesis by inhibiting
Rho GTPases and ERK signaling pathways. Our research comprehensively focuses on the inhibitory effects of morelloflavone on
endothelial cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and capillary
structure formation in response to VEGF. Furthermore, we show
that morelloflavone can inhibit ex vivo and in vivo angiogenesis
and tumor angiogenesis in xenograft mouse prostate tumor model.
Unlike those widely used anticancer agents that have adverse
effects (33) or severe cytotoxicity to induce cell apoptosis in
modern cancer chemotherapy, morelloflavone presents low
cytotoxicity but with outstanding antiangiogenic actions. FACS
analysis indicates that morelloflavone is weak to induce sub-G0
distribution in both HUVECs and prostate cancer PC-3 cell lines
(results not shown). In SCID mouse model, we also found that

Figure 5. Morelloflavone inhibits VEGF-induced activation of Rho GTPases and the phosphorylation of ERK pathway. A, morelloflavone has no effect on VEGFR2
activation. Effect of morelloflavone on VEGFR2 activation was analyzed by a specific VEGFR2 inhibition assay. Points, mean (n = 3); bars, SE. B, morelloflavone
inhibits RhoA and Rac1 GTPase activation, whereas it has little effect on Cdc42. HUVECs were pretreated with various concentrations of morelloflavone for
30 min before being stimulated with 50 ng/mL VEGF for a certain time. After that, cells were washed with cold PBS and lysed on the dish in RIPA buffer. GTP-bound
active RhoA was pulled down using the GST-RBP fusion protein immobilized on glutathione beads and detected with anti-RhoA antibody. Active GTP-bound
Rac1 or Cdc42 was pulled down using the GST-PBD fusion protein of PAK1 immobilized on glutathione beads and the active Rac1 and Cdc42 were detected with
anti-Rac1 and anti-Cdc42 antibodies. C, effects of morelloflavone on the phosphorylation and activation of Raf/MEK/ERK pathway at different concentrations.
Phosphorylation and activation of different protein kinases in Raf/MEK/ERK pathway were examined by specific antibodies, including pSer338-c-Raf antibody, pSer217/221MEK1/2 antibody, pThr202/Tyr204-ERK1/2 antibody, and pSer380-p90RSK antibody. D, morelloflavone inhibited AP-1 activity. AP-1 reporter gene construct was
transfected into 293T cells, and then the transfected cells were treated with different concentrations of morelloflavone for 24 h. The relative activity was measured by the
luciferase assay as described in Materials and Methods. Columns, mean of AP-1 luciferase activities calculated from three independent experiments; bars, SE.

extravasations and distant metastasis (37, 38). In addition, in
endothelial cells, both Rac1 and RhoA activation lead to stress
fiber formation and increased focal adhesion (29). Rac1 is required
and sufficient for the activation of endothelial cell haptotaxis and
VEGF-stimulated chemotaxis (29, 39). Therefore, turning off these
molecular switches or interfering with their functions by
depressing these small GTPase activities can reverse the cell
proangiogenic motility and migration (12). We found that
morelloflavone could depress the RhoA and Rac1 GTPase
activation with concentration-dependent manner. In agreement
with the above results, the motility of endothelial cells triggered by
VEGF n our ex vivo and in vivo assays can be significantly inhibited
by morelloflavone at low concentrations, suggesting that small Rho
GTPases are rational molecular targets of morelloflavone for
modulating angiogenesis in endothelial cells.
One of the key cell signaling pathways involved in cell
proliferation, survival, and tumorigenesis is the Raf/MEK/ERK
pathway (12, 40–43). This pathway links extracellular signals
directly to nuclear transcription factors and regulation of gene

morelloflavone (8 mg/kg/d) did not affect the body weight of
the mice but showed significant inhibitory effects on solid
tumor growth and tumor angiogenesis. Thus, we assume that
morelloflavone may be a novel anticancer agent with limited
toxicity. In most cases, morelloflavone effectively induces cell
growth inhibition of cultured tumor PC-3 cells at concentrations
over 80 Amol/L. In contrast, morelloflavone sufficiently inhibited
VEGF-induced angiogenic responses only at or <10 Amol/L in
ex vivo and in vitro angiogenesis assays. Such concentration has
little effect on endothelial cell viability. Because VEGF is a major
inducer for the formation of tumor vasculature (34, 35), our results
show that morelloflavone inhibits tumor growth in vivo via their
antiangiogenic activity at a much lower concentration and much
earlier than their cytotoxicity effects on tumor cells.
The Rho family of small GTPases, including RhoA, Rac1, and
Cdc42, as part of the Ras superfamily, is a molecular switch and
involved in almost every stage of tumor progression and tumor
angiogenesis (10, 12, 36). Coordinated activation of individual Rho
GTPase is required for cancer cells to successfully complete the

expression (44). Our results illustrated that morelloflavone could
significantly inhibit the activation of Raf/MEK/ERK protein kinases
in a concentration-dependent manner with the effective concentration of 10 Amol/L. Moreover, morelloflavone can suppress the
activation of ERK downstream transcription factors, such as
AP-1 and p90RSK, which regulate gene expression involved in
angiogenesis (30, 45). These results are consistent with the
antiproliferation functions of morelloflavone by inducing a
depletion of endothelial cells in the G0-G1 phase and a concomitant
accumulation in G2-M phase. Taken together, our studies indicate
that morelloflavone is a potential inhibitor of tumor angiogenesis
by targeting the Rho GTPase and ERK signaling pathways.
