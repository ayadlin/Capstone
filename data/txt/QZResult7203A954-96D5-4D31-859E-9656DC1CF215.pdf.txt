BACKGROUND: INNO-406, a dual v-abl Abelson murine leukemia viral oncogene homolog (Abl)/v-yes-1 Yamaguchi
sarcoma viral-related oncogene homolog (Lyn) tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI), has demonstrated specific Lyn kinase
inhibitory activity with no or limited activity against other sarcoma (Src) family member kinases. Several breakpoint
cluster region (Bcr)-Abl kinase domain mutations are sensitive to INNO-406 in vitro, including mutations that involve
a phenylalanine-to-leucine or phenylalanine-to-valine substitution at codon 317 (F317L and F317V, respectively). In the
current study, the authors evaluated the use of INNO-406 in patients with Philadelphia (Ph) chromosome-positive
chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) or acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) after imatinib resistance or intolerance.
METHODS: A dose-escalation study was conducted at a starting dose of oral INNO-406 30 mg once daily. Cohorts
of at least 3 patients were treated at each dose level until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) was reached. Twicedaily dosing also was evaluated. Therapy was allowed to continue for a maximum of 24 months. RESULTS: INNO-406
was administered to 56 patients with imatinib resistance (n ¼ 40) or intolerance (n ¼ 16). Other previous treatments
included nilotinib (n ¼ 20 patients), dasatinib (n ¼ 26 patients), and dasatinib/nilotinib (n ¼ 9 patients). Common
mutations at the time of study entry included a tyrosine-to-histidine substitution at codon 253 (Y253H) (n ¼ 6
patients), a glycine-to-glutamic acid substitution at codon 250 (G250E) (n ¼ 4 patients), a threonine-to-isoleucine
substitution at codon 315 (T315I) (n ¼ 4 patients), and F317L (n ¼ 3 patients). Of 31 patients with CML in chronic
phase who received INNO-406, the major cytogenetic response rate was 19%. No responses were observed in
patients who had CML in accelerated phase, CML in blastic phase, or Ph-positive ALL. The dose-limiting toxicities
(DLTs) at an INNO-406 dose of 480 mg twice daily were liver function abnormalities and thrombocytopenia.
CONCLUSIONS: INNO-406 had anti-CML efficacy in a heavily pretreated study population. On the basis of the classic
determinations of both DLT and MTD, the recommended phase 2 dose of oral INNO-406 was 240 mg twice daily.

Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is a hematopoietic stem cell disorder in which 95% of patients display a reciprocal translocation between chromosomes 9 and 22. The resulting Philadelphia (Ph) chromosome abnormality yields a
fusion gene that encodes a constitutively active breakpoint cluster region (Bcr)-v-abl Abelson murine leukemia viral
oncogene homolog (Abl) tyrosine kinase and is considered essential for the pathophysiology of CML.1,2
In the United States, about 5000 individuals are diagnosed with CML each year.3 Historically, the 5-year survival
rate for patients with CML in chronic phase (CML-CP) was approximately 40%.4 Since the introduction in 2001 of the
first specific Bcr-Abl tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) imatinib mesylate, the estimated 5-year to 7-year survival rates for

newly diagnosed patients with CML-CP have increased to
>90%.5-8 Thus, as patients with CML live longer, prevalence of the disease is expected to increase over the coming
years.
The success of imatinib demonstrates that specific
inhibition of Bcr-Abl kinase has clinical benefits in the
treatment of CML. However, based on the findings from
a 5-year follow-up assessment, imatinib resistance occurs
at a rate of approximately 4% per year.7,8 It is believed
that resistance is caused by of 3 main mechanisms: 1)
increased expression of Bcr-Abl; 2) Bcr-Abl mutations;
and 3) the development of Bcr-Abl–independent resistance pathways, such as the activation of v-yes-1 Yamaguchi sarcoma viral-related oncogene homolog (Lyn)
kinase.6,9,10 In patients with Ph-positive acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) and in those with CML in accelerated phase (CML-AP) or blastic phase (CML-BP),
imatinib treatment often fails to achieve high rates of
complete cytogenetic response; these patients frequently
develop resistance to therapy and disease recurrence. In
20% to 55% of such patients, treatment resistance can be
attributed to the emergence of clones with mutant forms
of Bcr-Abl, which exhibit a decreased sensitivity to imatinib. More than 60 mutant forms of Bcr-Abl have been
detected,11-14 the most common of which include a glutamic acid-to-lysine substitution at codon 255 (E255K), a
threonine-to-isoleucine substitution at codon 315
(T315I), and a methionine-to-threonine substitution at
codon 351 (M351T). Mutants have various degrees of
imatinib resistance15-17; thus, more potent Bcr-Abl inhibitors or dual Abl/Lyn inhibitors may improve treatment
results.
INNO-406, a dual Abl/Lyn TKI, may be an effective treatment for certain leukemias (Ph-positive CML
and ALL). INNO-406 was developed to overcome imatinib resistance.11,12 Unlike other second-generation TKIs,
INNO-406 demonstrates specific Lyn kinase inhibitory
activity with no or limited activity against other sarcoma
(Src) family member kinases. Numerous Bcr-Abl kinase
domain mutations are sensitive to INNO-406 in vitro,
including phenylalanine-to-leucine or phenylalanine-tovaline substitution at codon 317 (F317L and F317V,
respectively). INNO-406 is 25 to 55 times more potent
than imatinib against the Bcr-Abl–positive leukemic cell
lines K562 and KU812 and against BaF3 cells that over
express unmutated Bcr-Abl (BaF3/um). Autophosphorylation of unmutated Bcr-Abl also is inhibited more
potently by INNO-406 than by imatinib. In vivo,
INNO-406 is at least 10 times more potent than imati-

nib.18,19 Chemically, INNO-406 is a 2-phenlaminopyrimidine with structural resemblance to both imatinib and
nilotinib. The molecular structure of INNO-406 is illustrated in Figure 1. The current phase 1, open-label, nonrandomized, dose-escalation study was conducted at 6
international sites from July 17, 2006, to November 28,
2007, to determine the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetic profile, and clinical activity of oral INNO-406
administered daily to adult patients with Ph-positive
CML or ALL after they developed imatinib resistance or
intolerance.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients
Patients with Ph-positive leukemias, including CML-CP,
CML-AP, CML-BP, and Ph-positive ALL, who had
developed imatinib resistance or intolerance were
included in the trial. The definitions of imatinib resistance
and intolerance were described previously.20-23 Imatinib
resistance was classified as either hematologic (white cell
count 15,000 cells/mm3 documented on 2 occasions
separated by at least 2 weeks) or cytogenetic (>35%
Ph-positive cells in the bone marrow after at least 1 year of
therapy or an absolute rise in the percentage of Ph-positive
cells of 30% over the best response). Imatinib intolerance
was defined as the presence of any toxicity that prevented
patients from receiving therapy (grade 3 or 4 toxicity or
persistent grade 2 toxicity according to the National
Cancer Institute [NCI] Common Terminology Criteria
for Adverse Events, version 3.0 [CTCAE v3.0]). Patients
with resistance or intolerance to other second-line TKIs,
such as dasatinib or nilotinib, also were included. Definitions of CML phases were reported previously.20-23
To be enrolled in the study, patients had to be aged
18 years, to have an Eastern Cooperative Oncology
Group score of 0 to 2, and to have normal cardiac,

hepatic, and renal functions. Women who were enrolled
in the study could not be pregnant or lactating. Patients
were not allowed to have received chemotherapy within
1 week or imatinib within 3 days before the start of the
trial. Exceptions included hydroxyurea administration as
indicated clinically before and during the first 21 days of
treatment and corticosteroids up to 48 hours before the
first study dose. Patients with comorbid states, such as
opportunistic and/or uncontrolled systemic infections,
impaired gastrointestinal function, psychiatric disorders,
and/or sustained toxicity from prior therapies, were
excluded from the study along with patients who had a
history of another primary malignancy of clinical significance that required intervention.
The study protocol was reviewed and approved by
institutional review boards at each study site. Patients
were required to provide written informed consent.
Study Design and Therapy
The primary objective of this phase 1 study was to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and doselimiting toxicity (DLT) of INNO-406. Secondary
objectives included the evaluation of response, safety, and
pharmacokinetic parameters.
The starting dose of INNO-406 was 30 mg and was
administered orally once daily. This dose is equal to 10%
of the 30 mg/kg dose level that was used in a previous
4-week rat toxicity study in which no deaths occurred
(data on file).24 In the absence of a CTCAE v3.0 grade 2
or higher drug-related toxicity, the dose of INNO-406
was escalated by 100% in cohorts of at least 3 patients. If
grade 2 drug-related toxicity occurred, then the INNO406 dose was increased by 50% until the MTD was
reached. The INNO-406 doses that we evaluated were 30
mg, 60 mg, 120 mg, 240 mg, and 480 mg once daily and
then 120 mg, 240 mg, and 480 mg administered orally
twice daily. Because all patients in the 480-mg twice-daily
cohort experienced toxicities, a twice-daily cohort
between the 240-mg and 480-mg twice-daily cohorts was
evaluated; this intermediate cohort received 360 mg twice
daily. Once the MTD was determined, up to 20 patients
in each of the 3 CML phases and up to 20 patients with
Ph-positive ALL were treated at that dose.
Intrapatient dose escalation of INNO-406 was permitted in patients who had a suboptimal response to
INNO-406 therapy only after the next dose level had
been documented as safe. A suboptimal response was
defined as a failure to achieve either a hematologic
response after 1 month or a major cytogenetic response

after 6 months of therapy. This was based on observations
that failure to achieve an early hematologic response or
major cytogenetic response after 6 months to 12 months
was associated with a worse outcome.22,23
At each step, the investigators evaluated the relevant
risks and benefits of continued study participation for
each patient. No more than 2 dose reductions were
allowed before the patient was withdrawn from the study
unless continuing was considered in the patient’s best
interest.
Patients were removed from therapy or further
assessment when they developed disease progression, of
their physician decided that a change in therapy was in the
patient’s best interest, or by patient’s request. Other reasons for removal of patients from the study were continued unacceptable toxicities despite optimal dose
reduction, noncompliance, and pregnancy.
Adverse events were graded using CTCAE v3.0 criteria. Disease response was assessed at specified intervals
according to disease-specific response criteria.
Other Assessments
Response criteria were described previously.21 A complete
hematologic response was defined as a normal white blood
cell count with normal differential and platelet counts
<450  109/L and no signs or symptoms of leukemia,
including no splenomegaly. A cytogenetic response was
defined as complete (0% Ph-positive cells), partial (1%35% Ph-positive cells), or minor (36%-95% Ph-positive
cells). A major cytogenetic response included complete and
partial cytogenetic responses (ie, 35% Ph-positive cells).
The incidence, severity, duration, causality, seriousness, and types of adverse events; physical examination
changes; vital signs; and clinical laboratory results were
recorded and tabulated. Standard pharmacokinetic and
pharmacodynamic parameters were determined, together
with the coefficient of variation of INNO-406 concentrations, to guide decision making with regard to dose level
and frequency. Patients were evaluated for both complete
and partial hematologic and cytogenetic responses. Mutational analyses were performed as detailed previously.22,23

addition to imatinib, most patients had previously
received other TKIs, including dasatinib (n ¼ 26
patients), nilotinib (n ¼ 20 patients), and dasatinib/nilotinib (n ¼ 9 patients). Forty-six patients had failed at least
2 TKIs (imatinib and dasatinib or nilotinib); 9 of 46
patients had failed all 3 TKIs (imatinib, dasatinib, and
nilotinib), and 10 of 56 patients failed only imatinib.
Fourteen patients (25%) were resistant to dasatinib, and
12 patients (21%) were intolerant of dasatinib. Seventeen
patients (30%) were nilotinib resistant, and 3 patients
(5%) were nilotinib intolerant. The median duration of
CML was 84 months (range, 4-267 months). Median
durations of INNO-406 treatment were 3.7 months
(range, 1-12 months) for the overall study group and 4.4
months (range, 1-12 months) for the subgroup with
CML-CP. All 17 patients who received 240 mg twice
daily after determination of the MTD had CML-CP.

2668

Safety
INNO-406 was tolerated well, and the once-daily dosing
cohorts that received 30 mg to 480 mg were treated without developing DLTs. After pharmacokinetic analyses
suggested that twice daily dosing might be beneficial,
twice daily dosing cohorts were initiated beginning with
120 mg twice daily. At a dose level of 480 mg twice daily,
DLTs, including elevations of transaminases and thrombocytopenia, were observed. Transaminase elevations also
were noted at an INNO-406 dose of 360 mg twice daily;
these included grade 3 alanine aminotransferase (ALT)
elevations in 4 patients and grade 3 aspartate aminotransferase (AST) elevations in 2 patients. Then, 17 patients
were enrolled at 240 mg twice daily as part of a protocolspecified expansion cohort, which was limited to patients
with CML-CP.
In the 17 patients who received INNO-406 240 mg
twice daily, transaminase elevations were observed but
were less severe. No patients had drug-related grade
3 AST elevations, and only 1 patient had a drug-related
grade 3 ALT elevation. Drug-related grade 2 ALT elevations occurred at the 240-mg twice-daily dose level in
9 patients, and a grade 2 AST elevation developed in
1 patient. The elevated transaminase levels that were
observed at 240 mg twice daily resolved when INNO-406
dosing was withheld temporarily and then resumed at a
lower dose. On the basis of these results, an INNO-406
dose of 240 mg twice daily is proposed for phase 2 studies.
In addition to elevated transaminases, the other
most common drug-related grade 3/4 adverse event noted
was thrombocytopenia (Table 2). When both drugrelated and nondrug-related thrombocytopenic events
were considered, 2 and 3 patients experienced grade 3 and
4 thrombocytopenia, respectively, including 1 patient
who initiated INNO-406 treatment with pre-existing
grade 4 thrombocytopenia. Platelet counts recovered
when INNO-406 was withheld and then resumed at a
lower dose.
This study incorporated a planned central evaluation of electrocardiograms (ECGs) during the first cycle
of therapy to assess for QT prolongation. During this period of intense monitoring, the corrected QT (QTc)
according to the Bazett formula increased to grade 2 in 4
patients, and the QTc according to the Fridericia formula
increased to grade 2 in 1 patient. Only 1 patient, who
entered the study with a waiver because of a prolonged
QTc, developed a QTc >500 msec during this routine
monitoring after Cycle 1. The patient experienced no further events after discontinuing INNO-406.

patients with CML-AP, CML-BP, or Ph-positive ALL.
Major cytogenetic responses were noted in 6 patients with
CML-CP. Three patients had a complete cytogenetic
response to INNO-406, including 1 patient on the
120-mg once-daily schedule, 1 patient on the 120-mg
twice-daily schedule, and 1 patient on the 240-mg twicedaily schedule. The remaining 3 patients had a partial
cytogenetic response to INNO-406, including 2 patients
on the 240-mg twice-daily schedule and 1 patient on the
480-mg twice-daily schedule. None of the 6 major cytogenetic responders had baseline cytogenetic clonal evolution. Thus, 4 of the major cytogenetic responses occurred
in patients who received INNO-406 doses 240 mg
twice daily. This represents a major cytogenetic responses
rate of 11% (6 of 56 patients) for all patients enrolled and
a rate of 19% (6 of 31 patients) for patients with CMLCP. For the patients who had major cytogenetic
responses, the pretreatment regimens and the associated
reasons for changes in therapy are listed in Table 4, which

(Cmax ¼ 487 ng/mL) standard deviation (SD) was 1.3
 0.5 hours.
Pharmacokinetic analyses performed in the entire
study population also demonstrated an increase in Cmax
with increasing INNO-406 doses for both once-daily and
twice-daily dosing. The half-life was relatively short; mean
(SD) half-lives for twice daily dosing on Day 1 and Day
15 were 1.99  0.817 hours and 2.28  0.751 hours,
respectively. For twice-daily dosing, the mean (SD)
accumulation factor was 2.73  4.96. The Cmax and the
area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) were
dose-proportional; however, dose proportionality for the
AUC was not demonstrable with twice-daily dosing.

Pharmacokinetics
Illustrative of the pharmacokinetic data observed in the
full analyses, the pharmacokinetic parameters of INNO406 in the 240-mg twice-daily cohort are presented. This
cohort was selected based on clinical safety and efficacy
evaluations that took events at the higher doses into consideration. Figure 2 indicates that the accumulation of
INNO-406 was observed on Day 15 for both the 360-mg
and 480-mg twice-daily cohorts. For the 240-mg twice-

DISCUSSION
In this phase 1 study of INNO-406, a novel, potent, dual
Bcr-Abl/Lyn TKI, we evaluated once-daily dose levels
ranging from 30 mg to 480 mg and twice-daily dose levels
ranging from 120 mg to 480 mg. The DLTs observed
included liver dysfunction and myelosuppression. The
proposed INNO 406 dose scheduled for a phase 2 study is
240 mg orally twice daily, a dose that was based on the
classic determinations of DLT and MTD from phase 1

Mutational Analyses
Mutational analyses performed at the central laboratories
revealed mutations in 22 of 49 patients (45%). Common
mutations included a tyrosine-to-histidine substitution at
codon 253 (Y253H) in 6 patients, a glycine-to-glutamic
acid substitution at codon 250 (G250E) in 4 patients,
T315I in 4 patients, and F317L in 3 patients.

response rate of 19%. Of all 56 patients who were treated
on this study, 71% were resistant to imatinib, and 29%
were intolerant of imatinib. In addition, 26 patients experienced resistance to or intolerance of dasatinib, and 20
patients experienced resistance to or intolerance of nilotinib. In the majority of patients, therefore, previous treatment with multiple Bcr-Abl TKIs had failed. Because
many patients in this study were being treated in the
third-line setting, a lower response rate would be expected
compared with that achieved in the second-line setting
represented by the dasatinib and nilotinib studies.
In the current study, no responses were observed in
patients who had CML-AP, CML-BP, or Ph-positive
ALL. Major cytogenetic responses were noted in 6
patients with CML-CP. Four of those responses occurred
in patients in the cohort that received a starting INNO-

406 dose 240 mg twice daily. This represents a major
cytogenetic responses rate of 11% (6 of 56 patients) for all
patients enrolled and a rate of 19% (6 of 31 patients) for
patients with CML-CP. Major cytogenetic responses have
been reported in 40% to 45% of patients with CML-CP
who were treated in the second-line setting with dasatinib
or nilotinib.21-23 It is unclear what response would be
expected with dasatinib or nilotinib in a study population
that included both second-line and third-line setting
patients.
Myelosuppression and pleural effusions are serious
adverse events observed with dasatinib, and myelosuppression and liver dysfunction have been observed with
nilotinib.21,24 These events were observed infrequently
with INNO-406. Therefore, the safety profile of INNO406 is unique, offering a potential advantage in the treatment of patients who have developed toxicities during
treatment with other Bcr-Abl TKIs. It is noteworthy that
a planned central evaluation of ECGs during the first
cycle of INNO-406 therapy revealed only 1 patient with a
QTc >500 msec; this patient, who had an elevated QTc
at baseline, entered the study with a waiver.

Mutational analysis revealed mutations before the
start of INNO-406 in 22 of 49 patients who were analyzed (45%). Among these were 4 patients who had
T315I mutations, which are known to confer resistance to
imatinib, dasatinib, and nilotinib. None of the 4 patients
who had T315I mutations responded to INNO-406.
Outcomes of CML treatment have improved dramatically since the introduction of imatinib. The rising
incidence of imatinib resistance and intolerance has
resulted in the need for alternative agents. Nilotinib, dasatinib, and bosutinib are second-generation TKIs that have
been developed to overcome imatinib resistance.11,12 All
3 agents have similar efficacy with slightly different
adverse effect profiles. There is a need for additional
agents that are more potent than both imatinib and the
existing second-generation TKIs. Because patients are
being treated longer, they are cycling more commonly
through different treatment regimens.
This study demonstrated that INNO-406 is tolerated at a dose of 240 mg twice daily. Lower dose schedules
also may be equally effective and deserve further evaluation. Further studies will be needed to achieve a better
evaluation of the efficacy of INNO-406 in patients who
have developed resistance to or intolerance of imatinib
and/or other TKIs.
