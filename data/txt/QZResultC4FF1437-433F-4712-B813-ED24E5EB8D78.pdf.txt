BACKGROUND: The current study was performed to report the long-term results of a trial comparing concurrent chemotherapy and
radiotherapy (CCRT) with surgery and adjuvant radiotherapy (RT) in patients with stage III/IV nonmetastatic head and neck squamous cell carcinoma. METHODS: Patients with stage III/IV resectable head and neck squamous cell carcinoma were randomized to
surgery followed by RT or CCRT. The trial was halted prematurely due to poor accrual. Human papillomavirus status was tested on
archival material using polymerase chain reaction sequencing. RESULTS: Of the total of 119 patients, 60 patients were randomized to
primary surgery (S arm) and 59 patients were randomized to CCRT (C arm). Human papillomavirus status was tested in 75 patients,
and only 3 were found to be positive. The median follow-up for surviving patients was 13 years. Analysis of the entire cohort demonstrated no statistically significant difference in overall survival and disease-specific survival (DSS): 5-year rates were 45% versus 35%
for overall survival (P 5.262) and 56% versus 46% for DSS (P 5.637) for the S arm and C arm, respectively. Analysis by subsites indicated that this difference favoring the S arm was mainly driven by survival data among patients with cancers of the oral cavity and
maxillary sinus. For patients with oral cavity cancer, survival was significantly better in those who underwent primary surgery compared with CCRT; the 5-year DSS rate was 68% versus 12% for the S arm and C arm, respectively (P 5.038). For patients with cancers
of the maxillary sinus, the 5-year DSS rate was 71% for patients on the S arm and 0% for patients on the C arm (P 5.05). CONCLUSIONS: These long-term results demonstrate a significant advantage for primary surgery in patients with cancers of the oral cavity or
maxillary sinus, providing strong support for primary surgery as the main modality of treatment for these subsites. In other subsites,
CCRT and surgery with adjuvant RT were found to demonstrate similar efficacy for survival in patients with advanced resectable

INTRODUCTION
The management of patients with locally advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) has undergone several
major paradigm shifts in the last 2 decades. Early interest in the combined use of chemotherapy and radiotherapy (RT) was
stimulated by the landmark Veterans Affairs and European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC)
studies, both of which compared chemoradiotherapy (CRT) with primary surgery for patients with cancers of the larynx and
hypopharynx.1,2 At the same time, there was much interest in the use of concurrent CRT for head and neck cancers including
nasopharyngeal cancers, and this study was undertaken to determine whether CRT can replace surgery in patients with head
and neck cancer regardless of subsites, keeping the surgical arm as the gold standard control.3 The slew of trials that ensued
supported the belief that concurrent CRT was superior to induction CRT in a range of subsites in which organ preservation
was critical, but to the best of our knowledge none of these included a surgical arm as a control.4,5
The discovery that a significant percentage of oropharyngeal cancers were associated with the human papillomavirus
(HPV)6,7 has led to studies demonstrating that HPV positivity confers a better prognosis compared with HPV-negative

status.7 As a result, there has been a call for the deescalation of therapy and renewed interest in primary
surgery as the mainstay of treatment and surgical staging
of disease. This surgical strategy has been further supported by the advent of new endoscopic techniques, the
introduction of transoral laser and robotic surgery, modern perforator flap techniques, and our increasing understanding of tumor biology and concepts of functional
surgery; surgery as a primary modality is certainly gaining
ground in many of the head and neck subsites.
Despite these changes, the fact remains that there is
a paucity of evidence of either level 1 or 2 that compare
with surgery on 1 arm of a prospective study. In 2005, we
published the results of SHN01, which demonstrated that
concurrent chemotherapy is comparable to surgery followed by adjuvant RT in patients with AJCC stage III/IV
nonmetastatic HNSCC, after a median follow-up of 5.6
years.8 The objective of this trial was to determine
whether concurrent chemotherapy was superior to the
prevailing conventional treatment at that time, namely
surgery and adjuvant RT, with survival as the endpoint.
The trial was stopped prematurely due to the difficulties
in accruing patients. We now report the long-term survival update, describe patterns of failure, report results of
HPV typing, and analyze outcomes by tumor subsite.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
The current study was conducted to compare concurrent
chemotherapy and RT versus upfront surgery followed by
adjuvant RT in patients with nonmetastatic stage III/IV
HNSCC. Details regarding eligibility criteria, randomization and treatment, follow-up, and statistical considerations have previously been reported in the initial
publication.8 The more important details are briefly summarized below.
Patient Population

The trial was open to all newly diagnosed patients with
histologically proven, resectable, nonmetastatic stage III/
IV HNSCC (excluding that of the nasopharynx and salivary glands) who had a good Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status (0 or 1) and adequate bone
marrow, hepatic, and renal function.
Randomization and Treatment

After recruitment, patients were then randomized to either of the 2 treatment arms: the standard arm (S arm)
consisting of radical surgery and adjuvant RT or the experimental arm consisting of combination chemotherapy
with cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil and concurrent RT
1600

(CRT; C arm). Randomization was stratified according to
primary tumor site (oral cavity/oropharynx, larynx/hypopharynx, others) and lymph node status (lymph node positive vs lymph node negative).
Patients on the S arm underwent radical resection of
the primary tumor with comprehensive neck dissection
(removing levels 1-5) for unilateral or bilateral disease as
needed, followed by adjuvant RT given to primary tumor
and upper neck at 2 gray (Gy) per fraction for 5 days per
week to a total of 60 Gy in 30 fractions over 6 weeks.
When lymph node disease was present, the lower neck
was treated with a total dose of 50 Gy in 25 fractions over
5 weeks. In patients with positive surgical margins, the
dose to the area at risk was brought up to 70 Gy using
reduced volumes. Patients on arm C received 2 cycles of
chemotherapy comprising cisplatin at a dose of 20 mg/m2
on day 1 and 5-fluorouracil at a dose of 1000 mg/m2 on
day 1, both given as continuous intravenous infusion for
96 hours on days 1 and 28 of the RT course. The total
dose of RT given to the primary tumor and upper neck
was 66 Gy in 33 fractions over 6.5 weeks whereas involved
lymph nodes received at least 60 Gy. Patients with lymph
node disease classified as at least N2 at the onset were
scheduled to undergo elective neck dissection 4 to 6 weeks
after CRT regardless of response. Salvage surgery was performed for patients with persistent or recurrent disease.
Follow-Up

After completing treatment, patients were followed
monthly for the first year, every 2 months for the second
year, every 3 months for the third year, and every 6
months up to 5 years and yearly thereafter for life.
Ethical Considerations

This study was approved by the ethics committee of the
respective local participating institutions. Written
informed consent was obtained from each patient. The
data safety monitoring committee reviewed the trial at 1
year and 5 years after the initiation of the study, and
advised early termination of the trial at the time of the second review due to poor accrual.
HPV Genotyping

Paraffin specimens from patients were obtained from the
tissue bank in the pathology department of each respective
study institution. Only specimens from patients who provided written informed consent for tissue use for research
and follow-up data were recovered and used. DNA was
extracted from 10 mm-thick slices of formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded HNSCC samples using the QIAamp

DNA Mini Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, Calif) according to the
manufacturer’s protocol. The area sectioned for DNA
extraction was examined and confirmed to have at least
60% tumor content by a board-certified pathologist
(J.H.). Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification of
genomic DNA was performed as described using HPVspecific primers to amplify the L1 region.9 Tumors
deemed to be positive for HPV underwent further genotyping by direct Sanger sequencing of PCR amplicons.
Statistical Analysis

Overall survival (OS), disease-specific survival (DSS),
locoregional recurrence-free survival (LRFS), and distant
recurrence-free survival (DRFS) were calculated using the
Kaplan-Meier method and the log-rank test was used to
compare differences between treatment arms. Subgroup
analyses were also performed based on different tumor
subsites for the oral cavity, oropharynx, hypopharynx, and

larynx. All subgroup analyses were compared based on
actual treatment received rather than assigned treatment.
All statistical analyses were performed using SPSS statistical software (version 21; IBM Corporation, Armonk,
NY). For all statistical tests, a P value <.05 was deemed
statistically significant.
RESULTS
Patient Cohort

From August 1996 to February 2002, a total of 119
patients were randomly assigned to the 2 treatment arms:
surgery followed by adjuvant RT (S arm) or concurrent
CRT (C arm). A total of 60 patients were randomized to
the S arm and 59 patients were randomized to the C arm
(Fig. 1). One patient on the C arm was ineligible due to
confirmed adenocarcinoma histology. Six patients were
lost to follow-up but were included in analyses for the period during which they were observed. The median

follow-up was 13 years (range, 0.5-14 years). Baseline
patient characteristics were comparable between both
groups and are summarized in Table 1. Based on PCR
genotyping, tumor tissue was obtained from 75 patients
in this cohort, only 3 of whom were positive for HPV. All
3 patients had tumors arising from the tonsils (2 patients
on the C arm and 1 patient on the S arm), and were confirmed to be positive for the HPV-18 subtype (data not
shown). Approximately 16.7% of the patients on arm S
(10 of 60 patients) and 31% of the patients on arm C (18
of 59 patients) failed to adhere to trial protocol, the details
of which are summarized in Figure 1.
Survival Analysis

At the time of last follow-up, 92 patients (45 patients on
arm S and 47 patients on arm C) had died. There were 29
patients with locoregional disease recurrence (13 patients
on arm S and 16 patients on arm C) and 27 patients with
distant metastasis (17 patients on arm S and 10 patients
on arm C). Analysis of the entire cohort demonstrated
that there was a difference in outcome between both treatment arms, but this was not statistically significant. The
1602

5-year OS rates were 45% versus 35% (P 5 .262) and the
DSS rates were 56% versus 46% (P 5 .637) when comparing the S and C arms, respectively (Figs. 2a and 2b).
LRFS and DRFS rates demonstrated similar trends but
the difference was not statistically significant between the
2 treatment arms (P 5 .462 and .134, respectively) (Figs.
2c and 2d).
Subset analyses demonstrated that the main subsites
that accounted for this difference in survival favoring primary surgery were in tumors arising from the oral cavity
and maxillary sinus. There were significant differences in
outcome noted between the 2 treatment arms for both
subsites. For the oral cavity, survival was significantly better in patients who underwent surgery and RT compared
with the CRT group. The 5-year DSS rates were 68% for
the S arm versus 12% for the C arm (P 5 .038) (Fig. 3a).
Similarly, rates of distant metastasis were higher among
patients on the C arm, with 5-year DRFS rates of 50%
compared with 92% for patients on the S arm (P 5 .05)
(Fig. 3b). However, no statistically significant difference
was observed in locoregional disease recurrence rates
between the treatment arms (P 5 .355) (Fig. 3c),
although there may have been a trend favoring the S arm.
In the subgroup of patients with tumors in the maxillary
sinus, the DSS and LRFS rates were also found to be significantly different between both treatment arms (Figs. 4a
and 4b, respectively) (P 5 .05). The 5-year DSS and
LRFS rates were 0% and 0% among patients on the C
arm and 71% and 86% among patients on the S arm,
respectively. Only 1 patient from each arm among those
in the maxillary sinus subgroup developed distant disease
recurrence. No significant difference was observed
between the treatment arms (P 5 .306).
There were no differences noted between the treatment arms with regard to cancers of the oropharynx, larynx, and hypopharynx (see online supporting
information).
Second primary malignancies (3 lung cancers, 3
colorectal cancers, 1 esophageal cancer, and 1 pancreatic
cancer) developed among a total of 8 patients (6.7%) (4
patients [6.7%] from arm S and 4 patients [6.8%] from
arm C). No statistically significant difference was detected
between the treatment arms (P 5 .645).
DISCUSSION
Despite changing paradigms, there is still much debate
regarding the optimal treatment strategies for patients
with HNSCC. Primary surgery has undergone a recent revival with the advent of newer surgical techniques and a
better understanding of tumor biology. In contrast, CRT

provides an attractive organ-preserving alternative if survival outcomes are similar. Although survival remains the
gold standard of treatment outcomes, several other considerations have to be made for the population of patients
with HNSCC, among whom smoking and alcohol consumption are pervasive: the likelihood of developing a second primary malignancy with limited treatment options,
late toxicities associated with radical RT, and quality-oflife issues.10-13

that were planned and was designed to demonstrate the
superiority of non-surgical treatment at a time when concurrent CRT was popular. However, the study was prematurely terminated for poor accrual mainly due to the
study design. Designing a study with such contrasting
arms as radical surgery and nonsurgical therapy led to the
majority of eligible patients opting for a nonsurgical
approach outside of the study. This notwithstanding,
our 10-year update is timely because no similar trial has
since been conducted, and in the current era of minimally
invasive transoral resections with microscopy, lasers, and

the surgical robot, it is imperative to establish the role of
surgery in the primary treatment of patients with
HNSCC.
The first important conclusion to be drawn from the
current update is that there appears to be either no difference in outcome or a slight advantage favoring primary
surgery plus RT compared with concurrent CRT. The 5year OS rate was 45% in the S arm compared with 35%
in the C arm (P 5 .262). This result has important implications in several settings. First, in patients in whom
chemotherapy is contraindicated, including the elderly or
1604

patients with renal impairment, the inability to treat these
individuals with concurrent CRT can be circumvented
using the alternative of surgery plus adjuvant RT. This is
particularly relevant in patients with locally advanced
tumors of the oropharynx, hypopharynx, and larynx, in
whom organ preservation strategies have traditionally
been used. Second, and perhaps more controversially, surgery plus RT may provide a reasonable alternative to deescalating therapy in patients with locally advanced
HNSCC with a good prognosis. This is particularly true
for those with HPV-associated oropharyngeal cancers,

although data from this trial cannot be used to draw this
conclusion because there were only 3 patients who were
classified into this subgroup.
The second major conclusion comes from the
subsite analysis performed herein. This is the likely explanation for why the outcome data for the entire
cohort favored primary surgery, and in which the role
of primary surgery in SCC of the oral cavity (and, to
a lesser extent, the paranasal sinus) can be defined. In
our subgroup analysis of the former group, improved
outcomes were starkly observed in those patients
treated with surgery compared with those treated with
CRT. The 5-year DSS rate was 68% among patients
on the S arm compared with a mere 12% among
patients on the C arm. Head and neck oncologists
have traditionally been reluctant to use CRT as primary therapy for patients with tumors of the oral cavity, citing reasons such as the higher risk of early and
late RT complications due to the anatomic limitations
of the oral cavity and the ineffectiveness of RT if
bone invasion is present. Nonetheless, National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines rank surgery
and multimodality treatment such as CRT as equal
options in the primary management of patients with
locally advanced oral SCC. To the best of our knowledge, the current study is the only level 2 evidence
supporting the superiority of surgery (with postoperative RT) compared with CRT as the primary modality
of treatment in patients with oral SCC. There have
Cancer

May 15, 2015

been several retrospective studies that have suggested
improved outcomes from primary surgery with adjuvant RT compared with CRT. For example, Gore
et al recently reported data from 2 institutions with
differing practices, in which improved survival was
found in the group of patients with oral cancer who
had undergone surgery and adjuvant RT.14 In other
retrospective studies examining the efficacy of primary
CRT in patients with T4 oral cancer compared with
historic controls, similar outcomes were achieved but
with significantly higher rates of late toxicities, especially osteoradionecrosis, noted among patients on the
CRT arm.15,16
Proponents of CRT have always cited the promise of
providing better systemic tumor control, although this
has not been demonstrated, even in an extensive metaanalysis.17 Surprisingly, the results of the current study
suggest that DRFS was better in patients treated on the
surgical arm than those treated on the CRT arm
(P 5 .05), in which the 5-year distant metastasis rates
were 50% for the C arm compared with only 8% for the S
arm. Although this may appear to be counterintuitive, it is
possible that surgery mitigates the emergence of aggressive
radioresistant clones that may account for the metastatic
phenotype.
In the current study, patients with SCC of the maxillary sinus treated on the S arm were found to have
improved DSS compared with those treated on the C
arm. Better locoregional control was also observed in
1605

Original Article

surgically treated patients. It is important to note that the
number of patients in this subgroup was small (10
patients in total: 3 on the C arm and 7 on the S arm) and
care has to be taken when interpreting these results. To
our knowledge, due to the lower incidence of SCC of the
maxillary sinus, few studies that address the role of CRT
have been performed to date and the results were
mixed.18,19 The development of second primary malignancies is a significant cause of mortality in patients with
HNSCC. The rate of second primary malignancies in the
current study cohort was 6.7% (8 patients), of which onehalf were from the upper aerodigestive tract. This is relatively low compared with the rates of 9% to 23.1%
reported in previous studies.13,20,21
There are several major issues with the current study.
First is the finding that the study was terminated prematurely due to poor accrual, which is a common problem
faced by many randomized studies of patients with head
and neck cancer. This results in a trial that is underpowered to conclusively state that the 2 modalities are equivalent. Second, the subgroup analyses were not planned
and, not surprisingly, numbers were small. However, the
differences noted in the outcome favoring surgery and adjuvant RT in patients with tumors of the oral cavity and
maxillary sinus do make us cautious in recommending
concurrent CRT as a viable alternative to our patients in
routine practice. It is important to note that the observation that no differences were observed in the traditional
organ conservation sites such as the larynx, hypopharynx,
and oropharynx despite the small sample size does lend
some level of credibility to the results observed in patients
with tumors in the oral and maxillary subsites. Third, in
the current study, postoperative adjuvant therapy was
only focused on RT and not concurrent CRT because this
trial was conducted before the landmark studies by Bernier et al and Cooper et al, which each were published in
2004.22,23
Although treatment outcomes are comparable
between patients treated with CRT and those treated with
surgery followed by adjuvant RT, there are risks and benefits to each treatment modality. CRT is an acceptable
option in selected groups of patients with oropharyngeal,
laryngeal, and hypopharyngeal disease sites with the view
of organ preservation without compromising survival.
This option should not be recommended for patients
with tumors in other sites except within the context of
unresectability. Although often disfiguring with resultant
compromise of upper aerodigestive tract function, surgery
and adjuvant RT with the addition of concurrent cisplatin
in the presence of high-risk pathological features (positive
1606

surgical resection margins and/or extranodal extension)
remains the standard of care in these other sites.
