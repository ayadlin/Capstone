ABSTRACT:
Hyperactivation of Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase is
prevalent in human lung cancer and its inhibition by the tyrosine kinase inhibitors
(TKIs), including gefitinib and erlotinib, initially controls tumor growth. However,
most patients ultimately relapse due to the development of drug resistance. In this
study, we have discovered a STAT3-dependent Akt activation that impairs the efficacy
of gefitinib. Mechanistically, gefitinib increased association of EGFR with STAT3,
which de-repressed STAT3 from SOCS3, an upstream suppressor of STAT3. Such a
de-repression of STAT3 in turn fostered Akt activation. Genetic or pharmacological
inhibition of STAT3 abrogated Akt activation and combined gefitinib with STAT3
inhibition synergistically reduced the growth of the tumor cells. Taken together, this
study suggests that activation of STAT3 is an intrinsic mechanism of drug resistance
in response to EGFR TKIs. Combinational targeting on both EGFR and STAT3 may
enhance the efficacy of gefitinib or other EGFR TKIs in lung cancer.

INTRODUCTION

failure [2]. Several resistance mechanisms, such as EGFR
T790M secondary mutation that leads to a higher ATP
binding capacity, and MET amplification resulting in an
aberrantly activated alternative pathway that bypasses
the inhibited EGF receptors, had been discovered. Such
resistance mechanisms occur in about 50% and 30% of
resistant cases, respectively [3, 4]. However, the resistance
mechanisms remain to be elucidated in at least 30% of
all resistant cases. In addition, 2nd generation EGFR TKI
(afatinib) aiming to overcome the EGFR T790M mutation
has failed to show the expected clinical efficacy [5, 6].
Taken together, these previous studies implicate some
other underlying mechanisms, such as nononcogenic or
oncogenic dependent drug resistance [7, 8], existing alone
or simultaneously with currently identified alterations of
the EGFR signaling, may play an important role in the
development of EGFR TKI resistance.
Signal transducer and activator of transcription-3
(STAT3) belongs to a protein family of transcription factor
which are essential for cellular functions. Activation of
STAT3 is determined by phosphorylation at tyrosine 705
residue and strengthened by phosphorylation at serine 727
residue [9-11]. Classically, two categories of pathways

Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related
mortality worldwide [1]. Lung cancer can be histologically
classified into small cell lung cancer (SCLC) and nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC), and the latter subtype
constitutes 80% of lung cancers. Among all NSCLC
patients, about 25% are estimated to harbor “activating
mutations” in sequences encoding the epidermal growth
factor receptor (EGFR) that causes a constitutive activation
of the EGFR signaling pathway and thus provides tumor
cells with an increased abnormal growth advantage. In
order to target this abnormal hyperactivation, selective
agents such as EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs)
had been developed, some of which, including gefitinib
and erlotinib, had been approved by FDA for treatment
of NSCLC [1]. This type of drugs selectively bind to
the ATP binding pocket of the phosphorylation sites on
the EGFR tyrosine kinase domain, thus suppress EGFR
activation and block downstream signaling pathways.
Gefitinib has shown measurable efficacy at early stage
of treatment, but patients become insensitive to this drug
after 6 to 9 months, which finally leads to treatment

are mediating STAT3 tyrosine phosphorylation, one is
receptor tyrosine kinase signaling, including EGFR,
the other one is cytokine-signaling pathway, including
IL-6/Janus-activated kinases (JAK) [9]. Accumulating
evidence has demonstrated that aberrant expression and
activity of STAT3 is implicated in both carcinogenesis and
development of drug resistance in several cancer types,
including NSCLC [10-15], suggesting that STAT3 may
contribute to resistance to EGFR TKI treatment in lung
cancer.
In this study, we have demonstrated that in human
lung cancer cells, gefitinib treatment induces, rather
than suppresses STAT3 activation as extrapolated from
traditional EGFR signaling orthodox. We have further
demonstrated that gefitinib not only promotes the
direct interaction between EGFR and STAT3, which
is needed for STAT3 activation, but also affects the
upstream regulators of STAT3 in a dose-dependent
manner. Low dose of gefitinib suppresses SOCS3 only
while high dose inhibits both SOCS1 and SOCS3. As a
result, activated STAT3 restores activation of Akt that
was initially inhibited by gefitinib. Akt is an oncogenic
protein kinase that is largely associated with cell survival
and proliferation [16, 17]. Restoration of Akt activation
eventually reduces sensitivity of the lung cancer cells to
EGFR interruption. Extensive cell proliferation studies
show that simultaneous inhibition of STAT3 sensitizes
the cancer cells to gefitinib-induced repression of cell
growth. Taken together, our data have suggested that
gefitinib-induced STAT3 activation and subsequent Akt
recovery may act as a novel mechanism of primary and
possibly acquired resistance against gefitinib in NSCLC.
Accordingly, combinational targeting of STAT3, Akt and
EGFR may prevent or reverse drug resistance of EGFR
TKI-based therapy in the lung cancers.

without notable recovery in the later time points (Fig.
1A), which is consistent with previous reports [17, 19].
Gefitinib treatment shows relatively limited effects on
the activity of ERK and p38 mitogen-activated protein
kinase (p38), even when the cells were treated with a
higher concentration of gefitinib of up to 8 μM. These data
suggest that the recovery of Akt activation at the later time
points of gefitinib treatment is not a result of the recovered
activation of the upstream kinases, such as PI3K and JNK.
To determine whether this Akt recovery following
gefitinib treatment is a common phenomenon among the
lung cancer cell lines, we also evaluated Akt activation
in two additional NSCLC cell lines, NCI-H2023
and NCI-H2126, both of which are derived from
adenocarcinoma lung cancer. As indicated in Fig. 1B,
a similar later time Akt recovery as what had been
noted in A549 cells was observed in both NCI-H2023
and NCI-H2126 cells treated with gefitinib. However,
a subtle difference in Akt recovery were measured
among these different lung cancer cell lines, e.g., while
both NCI-H2126 and A549 showed a clear later time
recovery of Akt phosphorylation at threonine (T) 308
(pAktT308) and serine (S) 473 (pAktS473) (Figs. 1B and 2B),
NCI-H2023 exhibited recovery of pAktT308 only following
gefitinib treatment. No recovery of pAktS473 was noted in
NCI-H2023 cells. This difference possibly resulted from
different gene mutation status among these cell lines.
Although all of these cells express high level of the wildtype EGFR, both A549 cells and NCI-H2126 cells also
harbored active mutations of Kras oncogene [20, 21].

Akt recovery is not due to re-activation of the
EGFR by gefitinib.
EGFR has been viewed as one of the key upstream
kinases responsible for growth factor-induced Akt
activation [22]. To determine whether the recovery of
Akt activation is due to failed inhibition of EGFR by
gefitinib at the later time points, we measured the levels of
internalization and phosphorylation of EGFR in response
to gefitinib. In immunofluorescent staining assay, gefitinib
treatment induced a fast and sustained internalization of
the EGFR (Fig. 2A). Treatment of the cells with 4 μM
gefitinib, a gradual translocation of the EGFR from cell
membrane to intracellular vesicles and finally randomly
distributed at the perinuclear area was observed, indicating
a constitutive and effective inhibition of the EGFR by
gefitinib.
To further validate the inhibitory effect of gefitinib
on EGFR, we next measured the phosphorylation status
of the EGFR in the cells treated with gefitinib. Again, the
time course studies had demonstrated a rapid recovery
of Akt phosphorylation in both serine 473 (S473) and
threonine 308 (T308) residues within 6 h following
the initial inhibition, esp. in the cells treated with 4

RESULTS
Gefitinib inhibited Akt initially followed by a
recovery of Akt activation at the later time points.
Activation of EGFR has been linked to the prosurvival signaling pathways, including Akt, STAT3
and RAF/MEK/ERK mitogen-activated protein kinase
(MAPK) [16-18]. To monitor the effect of EGFR inhibition
on these downstream pathways, we performed time course
studies in the A549 cells treated with gefitinib, a selective
inhibitor of the tyrosine kinase site in the catalytic domain
of EGFR. The Akt activation was inhibited by gefitinib at
the earlier time points (0.5 to 2 h). However, the inhibited
Akt activation was gradually recovered at the later time
points (4 to 6 h) (Fig. 1A). In contrast, gefitinib showed
a sustained inhibition on the upstream kinases of Akt,
including PI3K and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK),

activation in gefitinib-treated cells.

μM gefitinib (Fig. 2B). Semi-quantification of the Akt
phosphorylation suggested about 40-60% recovery of Akt
activation at the 4 to 6 h time points of gefitinib treatment
(Fig. 2C). However, there is no similar recovery pattern
of EGFR phosphorylation following gefitinib treatment.
At both 4 and 8 μM gefitinib treatments, phosphorylation
of Y1068 and T669 of EGFR was substantially inhibited
from the earlier to later time points (Fig. 2B). These data,
thus, suggest that the Akt recovery is not a result of failed
inhibition of EGFR by gefitinib either.

It has been well-documented that STAT3 signaling
pathway contributes to Akt activation in response to a
number of extracellular and intracellular signals [25].
More recently, STAT3-Akt activation loop has been
uncovered in lung epithelial cells [26-28]. Based on that
rationale, we hypothesize that gefitinib-induced STAT3
activation is responsible for the sequential recovery of
Akt phosphorylation. To test that, we co-treated cells with
Sttatic, a STAT3 inhibitor, which potently down regulates
its phosphorylation without affecting the total amount of
STAT3. As shown in the Figs.4A and 4B, when STAT3
function is inhibited, the recovery pattern of Akt is also
eliminated even when EGFR is hyperactivated possibly
by the treatment of STAT3 inhibitor, Sttatic. In addition,
Sttatic co-treatment does not exhibit significant inhibitory
effects on ERK and P38 phosphorylation at the same time
(Fig. 4B), suggesting that Akt recovery is specifically
dependent on STAT3 function. In order to exclude the
potential off-target effects of the chemical inhibitor, we
further employed a siRNA-based gene silencing strategy
to confirm the above observation. When the cells were
transfected with STAT3 specific siRNA, siSTAT3, the
total amount and activity of STAT3 are reduced, and the
recovery pattern of Akt is eliminated, although the basal

STAT family proteins, STAT3 in particular, play an
essential role in EGFR-mediated cellular responses [16].
Emerging evidence has demonstrated that hyperactivation
of STAT3 contributes to carcinogenesis in a variety of
cancer types and disruption of the STAT3 signaling
decreased tumor growth [23, 24]. Inhibition of EGFR
by gefitinib is supposed to be able to down regulate
the subsequent STAT3 activity. However, time course
test showed that gefitinib treatment, in fact, induces
STAT3 activation in A549 cells (Fig. 3). After exposure
to gefitinib at both 4μM and 8μM, a rapid increase of
phosphorylation of STAT3 in tyrosine 705 residue (Y705)
was observed and the intensity of which is not affected
by different doses of gefitinib. Interestingly, the trend of
gefitinib-induced STAT3 activation is accordant with the
recovery pattern of Akt after gefitinib treatment, indicating
potential interaction between these two pathways (Fig.3)

level of Akt phosphorylation is elevated. In contrast,
the cells transfected with control siRNA or without
transfection show no inhibitory effects on either STAT3
activation or the Akt recovery (Figs.4C & 4D).

Since gefitinib has been shown to induce STAT3
activation and subsequent Akt recovery (Fig.2 and Fig.3),
we went to assess the anti-tumor efficacy of combinational
inhibition of EGFR and STAT3. A549 cells were exposed
to dose-dependent treatment of gefitinib (2-16μM) in
combination with STAT3 inhibitor (5μM) for 24 h and
48 h, respectively, before cell viability was examined
and analyzed. As shown in Fig.6, combinational STAT3
inhibition significantly fortifies the anti-cell growth effects
of gefitinib in lung cancer cells compared to the group
of gefitinib alone (P<0.01 in both tests). These results
indicate that combinational targeting of STAT3 may be an
effective method to overcome the intrinsic insensitivity to
EGFR TKI therapy of lung cancer cells.

Gefitinib promotes physical binding of STAT3 to
EGFR.
Prompted by the activation of STAT3 by gefitinib,
we then sought to identify the mechanism of how gefinitib
activates STAT3. In receptor tyrosine kinase-dependent
signaling, STAT3 activation is increased by binding
to certain STAT3 docking sites on EGFR c-terminal
domains [29]. To determine the direct physical interaction
between STAT3 and EGFR, immunoprecipitation assay
was performed. As shown in Fig.5A, gefitinib treatment
induced a stronger binding of STAT3 to EGFR when
identical amount of total protein is used for pull down
by anti-STAT3 antibody. Another fundamental signaling
pathway leading to STAT3 activation is cytokine pathway
in which STAT3 is activated by Janus Kinase (JAK)
family proteins, which is negatively regulated by the
suppressor of cytokine signaling proteins (SOCS), such
as SOCS1 and SOCS3. In order to identify the potential
role of the regulators in cytokine-activated pathway, we
carried out another time course study to determine the
levels of the SOCS proteins. Level of SOCS3 is reduced
in cells treated with 4μM and 8μM gefitinib, while
significant reduction of SOCS1 is observed in 8μM group
only (Fig. 5B), suggesting that gefitinib is able to inhibit
SOCS proteins in a manner of dose-dependency, which
accounted for an alternative mechanism contributing to
gefitinib-induced STAT3 activation.

successful cure of NSCLC via EGFR TKI-based therapies
since it occurs in almost all NSCLC patients including
those initially sensitive to EGFR targeting therapy
after 6-9 months treatment. The subsequent relapse and
progression of disease finally leads to treatment failure.
The fact that abnormalities leading to resistance to
gefitinib frequently overlap and that efforts aiming to
overcome defined resistance mechanisms show limited
efficacy both in vitro and in vivo, indicating possibilities
of other mechanisms which are crucial for occurrence and
maintenance of resistance against EGFR TKI in NSCLC
[5]. Explorations into such mechanisms are of scientific
and clinical significance.

It has long been believed that EGFR TKIs, such
as gefitinib, function through selectively binding to
the tyrosine kinase domain on EGFR and suppressing
its major downstream pro-survival and anti-apoptosis
signaling pathways, including STAT3, Akt and ERK
[16, 17, 19]. In this study, however, we highlight the
gefitinib-induced STAT3 activation in NSCLC cell lines
A549, NCI-H2023 and NCI-H2126, which is against the
classic knowledge of tyrosine kinase-dependent pathway
of STAT3 activation [16]. In addition, based on previously
defined STAT3-Akt axis in lung epithelial cells [26], we
have further demonstrated that phosphorylation level of
Akt substantially recovered rapidly from initial inhibition
within 6 hours after gefitinib treatment and this process
is dependent on the synchronous gefitinib-induced STAT3
activation. Considering the pivotal role of STAT3 and
Akt in anti-apoptotic machinery [23, 25, 30, 31], our
study answers, at least partly, why certain types of lung
cancer cells are resistant to gefitinib-induced cell death.
Moreover, this notion has been further substantiated by
the cell viability assay using combinational inhibition of
EGFR and STAT3. Even slight inhibition (5μM) of the
latter can significantly enhance the anti-tumor efficacy of
gefitinib, especially at low doses, indicating a promising
synergistic strategy to control resistance to gefitinib. On
the other hand, this study also sheds light on the acquired
resistance of gefitinib. It is likely that lung cancer cells
take advantage of or even strengthen this gefitinib-induced
STAT3-Akt axis through long term exposure to gefitinib
in order to gain resistance to it. This hypothesis is partly
confirmed by the observation that STAT3 is hyperactivated
in tyrosine 705 residue in gefitinib-resistant lung cancer
cell line derived from wild type A549 cells [32]. Increased
STAT3 phosphorylation has also been observed in EGFR
mAb treatment-resistant cell models of head and neck
squamous carcinoma (HNSCC) and bladder cancer [33].
Furthermore, gefitinib-induced STAT3-Akt axis defined in
this study also provides explanation for the mechanism
of dramatic efficacy of combinational suppression of
STAT3 or subsequent Akt/mTOR in overcoming acquired

suggested an amplified expression of the wild-type EGFR
is more frequent in prevalence yet associated with less
sensitivity to gefitinib treatment. The results of this study
have revealed a new mechanism of resistance to gefitinib,
especially in cells with an overexpressed wild-type
EGFR. In the future, the role of gefitinib-induced STAT3Akt activation loop needs to be further tested among
the NSCLC cells with different EGFR statuses, which
will provide deeper insights into our knowledge of drug
resistance in NSCLC and provide valuable information to
optimize anti-tumor therapy in lung cancer patients.

resistance in both in vitro and in vivo lung cancer models
receiving EGFR TKI-based therapy [34-36].
Activation of STAT3 is achieved from both receptor
tyrosine kinase pathway, including EGFR-centered
signaling, and cytokine signaling pathway, for instance,
Interleukin-6/JAK/STAT3 pathway [9]. In an effort to
explore the mechanisms underlying gefitinib-induced
STAT3 activation, we demonstrate that gefitinib not only
promotes the direct binding of EGFR and STAT3 but
also, surprisingly, affects the receptor tyrosine kinaseindependent pathway of STAT3 activation. Multiple
tyrosine residues on the cytoplasmic region of EGFR,
including Y1068, Y1086 and Y1045, have been identified
as docking sites where STAT3 uses its SH2 and DNAbinding domains to interact with EGFR and gets activated
[29]. In agreement with such notion, our study shows that
gefitinib treatment is able to directly promote the physical
interaction between EGFR and STAT3, and thus regulates
STAT3 activity in A549 cells. More interestingly, we
have also revealed that gefitinib down regulates another
important upstream regulator of STAT3, the SOCS family
proteins. As shown in Fig. 5, gefitinib at 4μM is able to
reduce the level of SOCS3, while higher concentration
(8μM) is required to more effectively suppress both
SOCS1 and SOCS3, suggesting that gefitinib also induces
STAT3 activation by altering cytokine signaling of its
activation. Considering SOCS proteins are also recruited
by certain regulatory region of EGFR, extending from
Y1114 to E1172, to block STAT3 activation [29], reduced
SOCS proteins by gefitinib may also abrogate the intrinsic
inhibitory effects of EGFR on STAT3.
The STAT3 activation and the subsequent Akt
recovery may be one of the key mechanisms of therapyinduced tumor progression in the lung cancer patients
who received EGFR TKI treatment. Both STAT3 and
Akt are important protein kinases contributing to either
oncogenic or nononcogenic chemodrug resistance that
fosters generation of the cancer stem cells or selection of
the fast growing cancer cells [7, 8]. At the present, there
is limited evidence showing that gefitinib resistance is
resulted from reprogramming of the cancer cells to form
cancer stem cells that not only replenishes the tumor mass
but also causes clonal shifts of the cancer cells from drug
sensitive cells to drug resistant cells. Thus, future studies
are much needed to determine whether the gefitinib
resistant lung cancer cells have the features of the cancer
stem cells. Considering the facts that both STAT3 and Akt
are critical kinases for the self-renewal and pluripotency
of the cancer stem cells [37, 38], it is plausible to combine
gefitinib with agents that target STAT3 and Akt to prevent
gefitinib resistance and the faster relapse of the tumors.
In NSCLC, differences in mutation status of
EGFR, including “activating mutations” and secondary
mutations, and preference in dependence of EGFR
signaling, are fundamental factors determining sensitivity
to gefitinib [19, 39-41]. Established evidence has
