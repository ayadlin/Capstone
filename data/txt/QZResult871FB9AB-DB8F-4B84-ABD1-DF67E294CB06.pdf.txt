Abstract
The transmembrane serine protease hepsin is one of the most
highly upregulated genes in prostate cancer. Here, we investigated its tumor-promoting activity by use of a mouse orthotopic prostate cancer model. First, we compared the tumor
growth of low hepsin-expressing LnCaP-17 cells with hepsinoverexpressing LnCaP-34 cells. After implantation of cells into
the left anterior prostate lobe, LnCaP-34 tumors not only grew
faster based on increased serum prostate-specific antigen levels but also metastasized to local lymph nodes and, most remarkably, invaded the contralateral side of the prostate at a
rate of 100% compared with only 18% for LnCaP-17 tumors.
The increased tumor growth was not due to nonspecific gene
expression changes and was not predicted from the unaltered
in vitro growth and invasion of LnCaP-34 cells. A likely explanation is that the in vivo effects of hepsin were mediated by
specific hepsin substrates present in the tumor stroma. In a
second study, mice bearing LnCaP-34 tumors were treated
with a PEGylated form of Kunitz domain-1, a potent hepsin
active site inhibitor derived from hepatocyte growth factor activator inhibitor-1 (Kiapp 0.30 ± 0.02 nmol/L). Treatment of established tumors with PEGylated Kunitz domain-1 decreased
contralateral prostate invasion (46% weight reduction) and
lymph node metastasis (50% inhibition). Moreover, serum
prostate-specific antigen level remained reduced during the
entire treatment period, reaching a maximal reduction of
76% after 5 weeks of dosing. The findings show that hepsin
promotes invasive prostate tumor growth and metastasis
and suggest that active site-directed hepsin inhibition could
be effective in prostate cancer therapy. [Cancer Res 2009;

Introduction
Hepsin is a member of the type II transmembrane serine protease family (1, 2) and was identified as one of the most highly upregulated genes in prostate cancer (3–8). Immunohistochemical
staining revealed strong expression in late-stage tumors and metastatic bone lesions (9, 10), suggesting a role of hepsin in tumor
progression. Moreover, based on gene expression analysis, hepsin
has also been implicated in ovarian cancer (11), renal cell carcinoma (12, 13), and endometrial cancer (14). However, it has

proven difficult to clarify the role of hepsin in tumorigenesis.
In vitro studies with different types of tumor cells yielded
conflicting results on the role of hepsin in cell proliferation
(9, 15, 16). Similarly, results from tumor xenograft studies were
inconsistent, showing tumor-promoting as well as tumor-inhibiting activities (17, 18).
Perhaps the most compelling in vivo study arguing for a tumorigenic activity of hepsin in prostate cancer came from Klezovitch
and colleagues (19, 20). The authors found that overexpression of
hepsin in a mouse model of nonmetastatic prostate cancer promoted primary prostate cancer progression and metastasis to several organs. Intriguingly, hepsin overexpression was associated
with disruption of basement membranes, suggesting that hepsin
activity might be linked to degradation of basement membrane
components. This view is consistent with biochemical studies,
which identified several hepsin substrates that are functionally
linked to basement membrane degradation and cell motility, such
as pro–hepatocyte growth factor (pro-HGF), pro–urokinase-type
plasminogen activator (pro-uPA), and laminin-332 (21–23). Of
note, uPA colocalized with hepsin in metastatic bone lesions of
prostate cancer patients (10), suggesting that hepsin may contribute to the formation of active uPA in bone lesions. Based on its prostate cancer–specific expression and potential role in tumor
progression, hepsin has become an interesting candidate gene for
early prostate cancer detection (24) and therapeutic intervention.
Hepsin enzymatic activity is potently inhibited by Kunitz-type
inhibitors including HGF activator (HGFA) inhibitor (HAI)-1 (21)
and by various serpins (25). Whereas most inhibitors lack specificity, HAI-1 appears to have a rather narrow specificity profile. Of
17 serine proteases examined thus far, HAI-1 mainly inhibited
hepsin, matriptase, HGFA, trypsin, and prostasin (26–29). Structural and functional studies showed that whereas the substrate
specificity of HAI-1 is completely contained in the NH2-terminal
Kunitz domain-1 (KD1; ref. 29), other HAI-1 domains can negatively regulate the binding affinity (30). Thus, KD1 by itself is a
significantly better hepsin inhibitor than HAI-1 extracellular domain (29), raising the possibility to harness its potency and specificity to inhibit hepsin in vivo.
Toward this aim, we generated a PEGylated form of KD1 (KD1-PEG)
with improved plasma half-life to neutralize hepsin activity in a mouse
orthotopic prostate cancer model with hepsin-overexpressing
LnCaP-34 cells. An initial in vivo study indicated that hepsin overexpression strongly promoted invasive growth in the contralateral side
of the prostate associated with increased serum prostate-specific
antigen (PSA) levels and periaortic lymph node metastasis. All these
effects were markedly reduced by a 7-week treatment with the potent
hepsin inhibitor KD1-PEG. The implications on the role of hepsin
in prostate cancer and as a therapeutic target are discussed.

Materials and Methods
Reagents and proteins. The synthetic p-nitroanilide substrates S2765
(DiaPharma FXa substrate) and S2444 were from DiaPharma. Pro-uPA
was from Fitzgerald Industries Int. Pro-HGF, KD1, and hepsin were recombinantly expressed and purified as described (29, 31, 32). Murine HGFA fulllength cDNA was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection
(mx85g08.r1). The cDNA encoding the protease domain of murine HGFA
(coding for Val370-Ser653) was fused to the gp67 leader sequence at the
NH2 terminus and a (Ala3-His8x)-tag was added to the COOH-terminal
Ser653. This construct was inserted into a baculovirus expression vector and
expressed in High Five cells and purified as described for human HGFA (27).
Expression, purification, refolding, and PEGylation of KD1. KD1 (residues 246-303 of HAI-1B) with an additional NH2-terminal poly-histidine
leader sequence was expressed in Escherichia coli, purified, and refolded as
described previously (29). Purified KD1 was dialyzed against 50 mmol/L
K2HPO3 (pH 6.5; PEGylation buffer) overnight at 4°C. KD1 was mixed with
the PEGylation reagent (average MW 28,737 Da; SUNBRIGHT MEGC-30TS;
NOF) at a molar ratio of 1:1.5 (KD1:PEG) and incubated for 90 min in PEGylation buffer. The reaction was stopped by acidification. Clarified solution was loaded onto a HiTrap-SP column equilibrated with 50 mmol/L
sodium acetate (pH 5.5). Proteins were eluted using a six-step gradient
0.15 to 0.7 mol/L NaCl in buffer A and fractions were analyzed by SDSPAGE. Fractions containing mono-PEGylated KD1 were pooled and stored
at 4°C. The concentration of KD1-PEG was determined by the BCA method
(Pierce) and calculated based on the protein content of KD1 (MW 8,919 Da).
Cell proliferation assay. LnCaP-17 and LnCaP-34 cells (32) were seeded
at 1,000 per well in a 96-well plate and cultured in serum-supplemented
RPMI 1640. At 0, 3, 6, and 8 days, 20 μL Alamar Blue (Invitrogen) was added
and cells were quantified according to the manufacturer's instruction. Results were normalized to day 0 and expressed as the mean ± SD of six wells.
Matrigel invasion assay. The assay was done essentially as described
by Xuan and colleagues (9). DU-145, LnCaP-17, and LnCaP-34 cells (1.5 ×
105 per well) were added into 24-well Matrigel-coated Fluoroblok invasion
inserts (BD Biosciences) with serum-supplemented medium in the lower
chamber. After 48 h at 37°C, cells that migrated to the lower side of the
filter were stained with 10 μmol/L Yo-Pro-1 (Invitrogen) and quantified
by measuring fluorescence intensity on a Spectramax-M5 microplate reader
(Molecular Devices).
Enzymatic assay with synthetic substrate. KD1-PEG and KD1 were
incubated with 0.25 nmol/L hepsin in HEPES [20 mmol/L HEPES
(pH 7.5), 150 mmol/L NaCl, 5 mmol/L CaCl2, and 0.01% Triton X-100] for
40 min. S2765 (0.2 mmol/L) was added and increase in absorbance at
405 nm was measured on a kinetic microplate reader (Versamax; Molecular
Devices). The obtained rates (mOD/min) were converted into μmol/L
p-nitroanilide/min by use of a standard curve and fitted to a four-parameter
equation (Kaleidagraph version 3.6; Synergy Software; n = 4). The Kiapp values
were calculated by fitting the data to the equation of for tight-binding
competitive inhibition systems (33, 34).
Pro-uPA activation assay. KD1-PEG and KD1 in HEPES were incubated with hepsin (1 nmol/L) for 40 min and pro-uPA (100 nmol/L) was
added. At 45 s intervals, the reaction was stopped by addition of
667 nmol/L HAI-2, which specifically inhibits hepsin but not uPA (32).
S2444 (uPA substrate) was added and increase in absorbance at 405 nm
was measured. uPA concentrations were calculated from an uPA standard
curve and plotted as a function of time to give the linear rates of uPA generation (nmol/L uPA/min). Data were fitted to a four-parameter equation
(Kaleidagraph version 3.6) to calculate the IC50 values (n = 3-4).
Pro-HGF activation by cell surface–expressed hepsin. Confluent
LnCaP-34 cells in 48-well plates were incubated with KD1 and KD1-PEG
in serum-free RPMI 1640/0.1% bovine serum albumin for 15 min at 37°C
before addition of 125I-labeled pro-HGF (0.01 mg/mL) prepared as described
(31). After 3 h at 37°C, aliquots were removed and analyzed by SDS-PAGE
(4-20% gradient gel; Invitrogen) followed by exposure to X-ray films.
Orthotopic prostate cancer model with LnCaP-17 and LnCaP-34
cells. LnCaP-17 and LnCaP-34 cells (32) were washed and resuspended
in PBS for prostate injection. Eight- to 10-week-old male SCID/bg mice

were anesthetized i.p. with ketamine (80 mg/kg) and xylazine (10 mg/kg),
shaved, and cleaned with iodine and 70% ethanol. A lower midline abdominal incision was made and the prostate was exteriorized. LnCaP-34 cells
(5 × 105) in 50 μL PBS (LnCaP-34 group; 21 animals) or LnCaP-17 cells
(LnCaP-17 group; 20 animals) were implanted into the left anterior lobe
of the prostate and the abdominal incision was sutured. Animals received
a single dose of buprenorphine following surgery to alleviate pain. Body
weights were measured daily and serum samples for PSA measurements
were obtained by orbital bleeding and stored at −20°C. After 16 weeks, animals were euthanized with CO2 inhalation and prostate tumors were surgically removed, weighed, and cut along the midline to yield the right
(contralateral side) and left (ipsilateral side) halves of the prostate. During
the study, 2 animals of the LnCaP-17 group and 3 animals of the LnCaP-34
group died of unknown causes, resulting in 18 animals of each group for
final analysis. Portions of the tumor were snap-frozen for RNA analysis.
Sections of the right and left tumor side were cut perpendicular to the midline for H&E staining and histologic inspection. For ex vivo bioluminescence imaging, the lung, liver, spleen, rib cage, as well as all enlarged
periaortic lymph nodes were removed and incubated with 25 mg/mL D-luciferin
(Invitrogen) in PBS. Organs were imaged using a cooled intensified CCD system to visualize luciferase signal indicative of metastatic lesions. Positive bioluminescence imaging signals were confirmed by histology.
Orthotopic prostate cancer model with KD1-PEG inhibitor. The
same model was used, except that only LnCaP-34 cells were used for prostate injection. After 6 weeks of tumor growth, the tumor-bearing mice were
identified by measuring PSA serum levels and by in vivo bioluminescence
imaging. Mice maintained under isofluorane anesthesia were injected i.p.
with 200 μL of 25 mg/mL D-luciferin followed by imaging on a CCD system.
Animals were divided into the control group (n = 16) and treatment group
(n = 12), both groups having similar PSA levels and body weights. KD1-PEG
in PBS or PBS (control group) was administered daily (10 mg/kg i.p.) up to
week 14. Body weights were monitored and no significant changes were
found between the groups. One animal of the control group died during
the experiment and was not included in the final analysis. At 14 weeks,
animals were euthanized and tumors and enlarged lymph nodes were removed. Ex vivo bioluminescence imaging of the excised lymph nodes was
done as described above, and metastatic prostatic tumor cells in the lymph
nodes were confirmed by histology. Primary tumors were cut along the
midline and the contralateral and ipsilateral side of prostate tumors were
weighed and processed for histology.
Quantification of PSA. Serum PSA levels were measured by use of a human PSA ELISA kit (Anogen). PSA concentrations in culture medium were
measured after treating LnCaP-17 and LnCaP-34 cells for 24 h with 1 μmol/L
KD1 or KD1-PEG in serum-supplemented RPMI 1640. The results were normalized to cell numbers and expressed as the mean ± SD of three experiments.
Histology. Histologic examination of prostate tumors and other tissues
was done at the conclusion of in vivo studies. Tissues were fixed in neutralbuffered formalin and processed for paraffin embedding. Morphologic analysis was done on H&E-stained 4-μm-thick sections by a pathologist (H.K.).
Pharmacokinetic measurements of KD1-PEG and KD1. Eight- to
10-week-old male SCID/bg mice were injected i.v. with 0.5 mg KD1 or
KD1-PEG protein. After 2, 4, 8, 24, 48, and 96 h, blood samples were taken
by cardiac puncture (two mice per time point) and the prepared plasma
was stored at −20°C. Plasma samples were incubated with murine HGFA
(which, unlike hepsin, is active in plasma) in 20 mmol/L HEPES (pH 7.5),
150 mmol/L NaCl, and 0.5 mg/mL bovine serum albumin for 45 min. After
addition of S2765 (0.5 mmol/L), the absorbance increase at 405 nm was
measured. Inhibitor concentrations in each sample were calculated from
standard curves with purified KD1-PEG and KD1. The concentration versus
time curve was best described by a two-compartment elimination profile of
the form C(t) = A*exp[-ln(2)*t/T1/2α] + B*exp[-ln(2)*t/T1/2β], with an iterative 1/y2 weighting scheme (WinNonlin version 5.0; Pharsight).

cells was indistinguishable from that of LnCaP-17 cells (Fig. 1A). This
result contrasts with an earlier study by Srikantan and colleagues
(16) showing that hepsin overexpression resulted in reduced LnCaP
cell proliferation. Therefore, we tested additional LnCaP clones with
hepsin expression levels that ranged between those of LnCaP-34 and
LnCaP-17 cells. However, none of these clones showed altered cell
proliferation (data not shown). It is conceivable that hepsin expression levels of LnCaP cells used by Srikantan and colleagues (16) were
higher than in our LnCaP-34 cells; in the absence of quantitative hepsin overexpression/activity data on their cell line, we are unable to
assess potential reasons for the different results.
Furthermore, compared with the prostate cancer cell line
DU-145, Matrigel invasion of LnCaP-17 cells was low (12%) and

not statistically increased in hepsin-overexpressing LnCaP-34 cells
(14%; P = 0.7; Fig. 1B). Also, PSA production by LnCaP-34 cells remained unaltered from LnCaP-17 cells (Fig. 1C). This suggested that
hepsin overexpression did not affect cellular function in vitro.
Effects of hepsin overexpression on tumor growth and
metastasis in an orthotopic model of prostate cancer. LnCaP
cells were injected into the left anterior lobe of the mouse prostate
and tumors as well as metastatic lesions were analyzed after
16 weeks. The LnCaP-34 group had a higher tumor occurrence compared with the LnCaP-17 group (78% versus 61%) and significantly
increased tumor weights (1.8-fold; Fig. 2A). After week 9, serum PSA
levels increased at a much higher rate in the LnCaP-34 group reaching 2.4-fold higher levels than the LnCaP-17 group at week 16 (Fig. 2B).

The results of the study are summarized in Supplementary Table S2.
There was a good correlation between tumor weight and PSA levels
(Supplementary Fig. S1). Histologic examination of tumor lesions
showed poorly differentiated adenocarcinomas with areas of hemorrhage and necrosis (Fig. 2C and D). The majority of LnCaP-17 tumors
were confined to the ipsilateral (left) side of the prostate, where tumor
cells were injected at the start of the study. Only 18% of tumors
showed invasion into the contralateral (right) side of the prostate;
the majority of animals had a normal-appearing contralateral side
of the prostate without any detectable tumor cells (Fig. 2C). In contrast, all of the LnCaP-34 tumors (14 of 14) showed invasion and
growth of tumor in the contralateral side of the prostate (Fig. 2D).
We performed immunohistochemical staining for E-cadherin and vimentin on contralateral prostate tumors to determine if epithelial-tomesenchymal transition played a role in the increased invasiveness of
hepsin-expressing LnCaP cells. Contralateral tumors showed the
same phenotype as ipsilateral tumors and showed membranous
staining for E-cadherin and lack of staining for vimentin (Supplementary Fig. S2), indicating the absence of epithelial-to-mesenchymal
transition. Furthermore, no differences in tumor morphology, particularly at the tumor-stroma interface, were noted between ipsilateral
and contralateral tumors. Although the staining was done on tumors
established in the contralateral prostatic lobe, we consider it unlikely
that tumors will exhibit epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition as they
transverse the midline but then revert back to the original phenotype
once a discrete tumor mass has formed.
Both LnCaP-17 or LnCaP-34 cells were engineered to express luciferase at comparable levels (32), allowing us to apply ex vivo bio-

luminescence imaging for detection of metastatic lesions in local
lymph nodes, lung, liver, spleen, and rib cage. Metastatic lesions
were only found in periaortic lymph nodes and occurred in 29%
of the tumor-bearing mice in the LnCaP-34 group (Supplementary
Fig. S3) but were absent in the LnCaP-17 group (Supplementary
Table S2). These results suggested that hepsin overexpression endowed LnCaP-34 cells with increased invasive capacity.
Hepsin RNA levels in LnCaP-34 tumors remained high compared
with LnCaP-17 tumors (Supplementary Table S3), comparable with
the results from cell culture experiments. Expression of other
genes, including the related proteases matriptase and prostasin,
as well as HAI-1, HGF, Met, uPA, and uPA receptor, were similar
in both tumor groups. Comparable results were obtained with the
corresponding mouse genes (Supplementary Table S4). Due to the
disappearance of mouse prostate epithelium in the LnCaP tumors,
the mouse epithelial-specific genes (e.g. matriptase, prostasin, and
HAI-1) were almost undetectable. However, mouse stromal genes
such as uPA and HGF and their cognate receptors uPA receptor
and Met were markedly expressed in both groups (Supplementary
Table S4), consistent with the presence of mouse stroma in LnCaP
tumors (Fig. 2C and D). In agreement with increased vascularization in areas of tumor growth, expression of the endothelial cell
marker PECAM was increased in both tumor groups (Supplementary Table S4). There was no difference between tumor groups in
the expression of the proliferation marker human and mouse cyclin D1 (Supplementary Tables S3 and S4).

has a short plasma half-life. Therefore, KD1 was PEGylated with
29 kDa PEG chains by use of lysine coupling chemistry. A structural
model of the KD1/hepsin complex indicated that three surfaceexposed lysine residues of KD1 were available for PEGylation.
They were located outside the binding interface, suggesting that
attached PEG chains may not substantially interfere with hepsin
inhibition by KD1 (Fig. 3A). Purified mono-PEGylated KD1 (KD1PEG) inhibited hepsin with a Kiapp of 0.3 ± 0.02 nmol/L, similar to
KD1 with a K iapp of 0.4 ± 0.02 nmol/L (Fig. 3B). Furthermore,
KD1-PEG inhibited the rates of uPA formation in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 3C) with an IC 50 value of 0.8 ±
0.11 nmol/L, similar to KD1 (IC50 0.6 ± 0.03 nmol/L; data not
shown). Both KD1-PEG and KD1 inhibited pro-HGF activation
by LnCaP-34 cells with similar potencies (Fig. 4A and B). At the
fully inhibitory concentration of 1 μmol/L, neither KD1-PEG nor
KD1 affected the production of PSA by LnCaP-34 cells (Fig. 4C).
Most importantly, KD1-PEG displayed dramatically improved
pharmacokinetic properties. In contrast to the rapidly clearing
KD1 (below detection at 1 h), KD1-PEG plasma levels could be
measured up to 96 h (Fig. 4D) with T1/2α of 3 h and T1/2β of 54 h,
comparable with a recently published multi-PEGylated Kunitz domain inhibitor of plasmin (35). As drug levels of KD1-PEG decreased ∼50-fold in the first 24 h, a daily dosing regimen of
10 mg/kg was selected for efficacy experiments.
Effects of KD1-PEG on invasive tumor growth and metastasis.
LnCaP-34 cells were implanted into the left anterior prostate lobe
and the tumors were allowed to grow for 7 weeks before treatment.
Histologic examination showed that all tumors were still confined to
the ipsilateral side of the prostate (tumor weight 0.26 ± 0.02 g; n = 9)
without invasion of the contralateral prostate. KD1-PEG was administered daily from weeks 7 to 14. The trough serum levels of KD1-PEG
ranged from 122 ± 33 to 180 ± 57 nmol/L (Supplementary Fig. S4),
although some samples were below the assay detection limit (2 of
6 at week 8 and 1 of 6 at weeks 10 and 12). This indicated that the
majority of treated animals were exposed to KD1-PEG levels expected to substantially inhibit hepsin activity.
At the end of the study, the contralateral prostate tumors of the
control group were almost the size of the ipsilateral prostate tumors (Fig. 5A), averaging 83% of the ipsilateral tumor weight

(Fig. 5B). KD1-PEG reduced the weights of contralateral prostate
tumors by 46% (P < 0.05; Fig. 5A and C) and this effect was relatively independent on the ipsilateral prostate size (Fig. 5D). In one
animal, the contralateral prostate was actually completely tumorfree (Fig. 5D, asterisk, and Fig. 5A, bottom). KD1-PEG had no effect
on the left prostate tumor weight (0.37 ± 0.05 g for controls versus
0.38 ± 0.05 g for KD1-PEG), which may not be surprising, because
its average weight only increased ∼1.5-fold compared with week 6.
KD1-PEG also strongly suppressed serum PSA levels during the
entire experiment (Fig. 6A). One week of dosing already resulted in
reduced PSA levels, and at weeks 12 and 14, PSA level reduction
reached 76% (P < 0.05) and 63% (P < 0.05), respectively. In addition,
lymph node metastatic lesions occurred in 10 of 15 control animals
but only in 4 of 12 KD1-PEG–treated animals, a reduction of 50%
(Fig. 6B).

Discussion
Despite the strong association of hepsin with prostate cancer
based on expression analysis of large numbers of patient samples,
a functional role of hepsin in promoting prostate cancer has been
difficult to demonstrate. A possible reason is that commonly used
mouse xenograft tumor models lack the appropriate prostatespecific microenvironment. This could be of considerable importance, because the epithelial surface-expressed hepsin is ideally
located to communicate with the stromal environment, for example,
by processing stroma-specific substrates by its surface-exposed protease domain. Based on these considerations, we established an
orthotopic prostate cancer model, which showed accelerated
growth of the hepsin-overexpressing LnCaP-34 tumors resulting in
almost a doubling of tumor weights compared with the low hepsinexpressing LnCaP-17 tumors. This can be attributed to the ability of
the LnCaP-34 tumors to invade the contralateral side of the prostate
leading to contralateral tumor weights that approached those of the
ipsilateral side.
The increased tumor growth was not predicted from in vitro assays showing that hepsin overexpression neither increased the invasive capacity nor cell growth. This observation rather points to
the potential involvement of tumor stromal components in the
hepsin pathway. Specifically, the hepsin-dependent contralateral
invasion and growth likely involved degradation of extracellular
matrix and basement membranes. In this regard, gene expression
analysis showed that genes implicated in degradative and invasive
pathways, such as murine uPA and HGF, were expressed in the tumor stroma and could potentially serve as substrates for human
hepsin on tumor cells (21, 22, 32). There is similarity to the expression of HGF and uPA in human prostate cancer in that both proteins are expressed in the tumor stroma and have been implicated
in tumor progression (36–38). In addition, hepsin was shown to
degrade laminin-332, a key component of basement membranes
(23). Therefore, it is possible that hepsin-stromal substrate interactions contributed to the locally invasive growth of LnCaP-34 tumors and, perhaps, also to the formation of metastases in
periaortic lymph nodes.
Our results support a role of hepsin in tumor progression, in
good agreement with conclusions drawn from a genetic mouse
model study with prostate-specific overexpression of mouse hepsin
(19). However, our orthotopic model showed that hepsin overexpression also resulted in invasive tumor growth leading to increased final tumor weight and elevated PSA levels, whereas
tumor growth was not increased in the study by Klezovitch and

colleagues (19). It is possible that, in this latter study, hepsindependent effects on primary tumor growth may have been masked
by the fast SV40 T antigen–driven tumor growth, whereas our orthotopic model may be more amenable for detecting such effects due to
the relatively slow growth of LnCaP tumors and the availability of a
distinct prostate compartment (the contralateral side of the prostate) for tumor expansion.
Targeting the protease active site is the most direct and common strategy to neutralize protease activity. Here, we used the
relatively specific hepsin inhibitor KD1 to examine whether neutralizing hepsin enzymatic activity could suppress tumor progression. Because of the inherently short plasma half-life of Kunitz
domain inhibitors, as exemplified by aprotinin (Trasylol), we produced the mono-PEGylated KD1-PEG having greatly improved
pharmacokinetic properties. As predicted from a structural model,
the attachment of a PEG moiety to KD1 did not reduce its inhibitory potency as determined by various enzymatic assays. The
KD1-PEG inhibition study was designed to specifically investigate
the effects of neutralizing enzymatic activity during the progressive
stages of tumor growth. Based on serum PSA levels, the onset of
hepsin inhibition was rapid and persisted throughout the entire
treatment period, suggesting strong effects on viable tumor mass.
Concordantly, the contralateral prostate tumor weights were significantly reduced, suggesting that KD1-PEG effectively suppressed
the hepsin-specific pathways that promoted invasion and growth
in the contralateral prostate. However, KD1-PEG did not significantly reduce ipsilateral prostate tumor and overall tumor weights,
which may be explained by the fact that, before KD1-PEG treatment, they had already reached 70% and 43%, respectively, of their
final weights. This would also imply that hepsin inhibition was primarily effective in suppressing invasion and subsequent growth
rather than reducing preexisting tumors. Consistent with this interpretation, KD1-PEG also interfered with the ability of tumors to
form metastatic lesions in periaortic lymph nodes.
A caveat with using KD1-PEG as hepsin inhibitor in our tumor
model is that KD1 is not completely hepsin-specific. Therefore, we
cannot formally rule out the possibility that it also inhibited pro-

tease substrates, which underwent hepsin-dependent activation
during tumor progression. Such putative protease substrates may
be localized to the tumor stroma and/or on the tumor cell surface.
It is, however, important to note that KD1-PEG had strong effects
on contralateral growth and metastasis, two endpoints that are entirely dependent on high hepsin expression in the tumor. Therefore, when considering potential KD1-PEG “off-target” effects
contributing to its inhibitory activity, it is clearly within the context of a hepsin-driven pathway. Only the use of a highly specific
inhibitor could provide absolute clarity. In this respect, protein engineering strategies have been developed for increasing Kunitz domain specificities (39) and should be applicable to KD1. Alternative
approaches are the use of highly specific anti-hepsin antibodies (9).
The suppression of hepsin-driven tumor progression by KD1PEG indicates that targeting the hepsin active site could be a
promising strategy for prostate cancer therapy. As with any therapeutic intervention, these approaches will carry the risk of adverse
effects. Until recently, hepsin deficiency, and thus therapeutic neutralization of hepsin activity, was perceived as safe, because hepsindeficient mice displayed an apparently normal phenotype (40, 41).
However, a recent study by Guipponi and colleagues (42) showed
that these mice were severely hearing-impaired. Although this was
likely the result of an irreversible developmental defect without any
bearing on the adult organism, it nevertheless adds a cautionary
note to therapeutic anti-hepsin strategies.
