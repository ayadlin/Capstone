BACKGROUND: Gene expression profiling (GEP) testing can help to predict the risk of cancer recurrence and guide decisions about
adjuvant chemotherapy for breast cancer (BC). However, no prior US studies have evaluated the relation between GEP testing and
the use of adjuvant chemotherapy by women treated in a general oncology practice. METHODS: Eligible patients were women under
the age 65 of years who were newly diagnosed with their first stage I or II, hormone receptor–positive BC between 2006 and 2011
(n 5 9405). This retrospective study was conducted with a data set consisting of registry data, health claims data, and GEP testing
results. The distribution of GEP test results was reported in terms of the risk of recurrence predicted, and logistic regression was used
to assess the association of test results with chemotherapy use, with adjustments made for multiple patient characteristics. RESULTS:
The proportions of tested women with low, intermediate, and high recurrence score results were 51%, 39%, and 10%, respectively.
Among these women, 11%, 47%, and 88%, respectively, received adjuvant chemotherapy. There was a significant, positive linear relation
of assay scores with chemotherapy use within the low and intermediate subgroups after adjustments for all other factors (adjusted
odds ratios, 1.17 and 1.20, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Adjuvant chemotherapy use after GEP testing is generally consistent with the
recommended test interpretation for women with a high or low predicted risk of recurrence. Chemotherapy use in the intermediaterisk group increased with Recurrence Score values, and evidence from ongoing randomized trials may help to clarify whether this
finding reflects optimal interpretation of GEP test results. These results demonstrate the principle that genomic testing, on the basis
of research establishing its utility, can be applied appropriately in general practice in accordance with guideline recommendations.

INTRODUCTION
Genomic and personalized medicine offers the promise of tailoring cancer treatments to an individual’s tumor characteristics and potentially maximizing effectiveness and minimizing side effects. One recent genomic technology for breast cancer (BC) is the 21-gene Recurrence Score test (Genomic Health, Inc, Redwood City, Calif). This tumor gene expression
profiling (GEP) test is based on a tumor’s 21-gene signature and is used to predict the risk of cancer recurrence and the
likely benefit of adjuvant chemotherapy.1 Historically, practice guidelines have recommended that women diagnosed
with early-stage, estrogen receptor (ER)– or progesterone receptor (PR)–positive BC should receive adjuvant chemotherapy with primary surgical therapy to reduce the risk of recurrence.2,3 Although randomized clinical trials have demonstrated modest survival advantages for such women receiving adjuvant chemotherapy,4 it can also result in significant
short- and long-term side effects and decrements in quality of life.5
The 21-gene BC assay provides women and clinicians with a Recurrence Score result that, combined with other
prognostic variables, can be used to identify women with early-stage, hormone receptor–positive disease who might

benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy or who might not
significantly benefit from chemotherapy and thus could
safely avoid its possible side effects.2,3 The test’s incorporation into US practice guidelines is based on several prospectively conducted studies of archived tumor samples
and large observational cohorts that support the validity
and utility of the test for hormone receptor–positive,
early-stage BC patients.6-10
The assay’s “value added” to well-established clinical
biomarkers may not be as widely accepted in general practice pending the outcome of ongoing prospective randomized trials. Furthermore, an estimated 35% to 40% of
women tested have an intermediate risk of recurrence.
The cost-benefit tradeoffs of chemotherapy are less certain
for this group.11 Nearly universal coverage by Medicare
and private insurers and studies documenting an increasing use of testing in academic institutions suggest that
patient awareness of testing has been increasing.12-14
However, few large-scale studies have assessed the effects
of GEP testing on the patterns of prescribing chemotherapy in general US oncology practices, which include both
academic and nonacademic settings, with the latter often
called community oncology practices.
To address this gap, we evaluated the association of
GEP testing with the 21-gene Recurrence Score with
chemotherapy use among women under the age of 65
years who were diagnosed with early-stage, hormone receptor–positive BC between 2006 and 2011 in 5 states
participating in one of the largest US commercial health
plans (California, New York, Kentucky, Ohio, Georgia).
We investigated whether the dissemination of GEP testing was associated with an overall change in adjuvant
chemotherapy use in women eligible for testing that was
consistent with guideline recommendations.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Data Sources

We created a new linked research database consisting of 5
state cancer registries containing clinical variables linked
with claims data maintained by HealthCore, Inc (Wilmington, Del), an independent subsidiary of Anthem, Inc,
which is an independent licensee of the Blue Cross and
Blue Shield Association in the 5 states. We then linked the
Recurrence Score results for all tested cases in our linked
sample through collaboration with Genomic Health, patent holder for the Oncotype DX 21-gene assay and provider of all testing in the United States. The participating
registries, HealthCore, and Georgetown obtained all necessary institutional review board and Health Insurance PortCancer

ability and Accountability Act approvals for this linkage.
More details of the data linkages are available online as
supporting information.
Study Participants

A total of 16,064 women between the ages of 24 and 64
years who were diagnosed with BC from January 2006
through December 2011 according to tumor registry data
and were successfully linked with HealthCore claims were
assessed for eligibility. We selected those women diagnosed with their first invasive BC (14,710). We excluded
893 cases with information missing for the stage at diagnosis or ER/PR status. From the remaining women, we
identified 9444 women diagnosed with stage I or II, ERpositive and/or PR-positive BC. We removed 39 women
who had less than 6 months of follow-up to ensure accurate ascertainment of adjuvant chemotherapy, and this left
9405 women available for analysis.
Study Measures

The primary outcome of this study was the receipt of any
guideline-recommended chemotherapeutic agent after
surgical resection that was initiated within 6 months of
the primary surgery. The Recurrence Score values were divided into low (<18), intermediate (18-30), and high
groups (>30) as defined in the original clinical validation
studies for the assay.9
From registry data, we obtained the age at diagnosis;
race/ethnicity; year of diagnosis; histological grade; and
ER, PR, and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2
(HER2) status. Staging was created with the American
Joint Committee on Cancer Collaborative Stage (version
7). The HER2 status was defined with standard Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results algorithms.15 We
grouped 33 tested women with HER2-borderline results
with HER2-negative cases. There were women with an
unknown HER2 status (40%) because 3 of the 5 registries
did not collect this data element before 2010. Using
HealthCore claims data, we ascertained the presence of 31
individual comorbid health conditions from the Elixhauser
index16 that were diagnosed as early as 2 years before the
BC diagnosis and as late as the month of diagnosis.
Statistical Analysis

We examined the distribution of Recurrence Score results
according to all sociodemographic and clinical variables
with the chi-square test. We then assessed the relation
between Recurrence Score and the use of chemotherapy
among tested women. In 3 logistic regression models, we
evaluated the association between Recurrence Score as a

proportions of women categorized in the low-, intermediate-, and high-Recurrence Score groups were 51%,
39%, and 10%, respectively. Fewer women between the
ages of 24 and 39 years had low Recurrence Score values,
and more had high scores, in comparison with women
between the ages of 40 and 59 years at diagnosis. More
black women than white women had high and intermediate Recurrence Score results. The hormone receptor status, HER2 status, and histological grade were significantly
associated with Recurrence Score results. For example,
39% of women with either ER- or PR-negative disease
had high Recurrence Score values, whereas just 7% of
those with both ER- and PR-positive disease did; 36% of
women with poorly or undifferentiated tumors had high
Recurrence Score values.

respectively. Figure 1 shows the relation between the Recurrence Score result and the receipt of adjuvant chemotherapy

and high-risk score ranges. There is an increasing sigmoidal relation between Recurrence Score and the receipt of
chemotherapy. Within the low-risk group, chemotherapy
use extended from less than 5% for women with Recurrence Score values of 5 or less to 15% to 20% among
women with values of 15 to 17. For the intermediate-risk
group, there was a more linear relation between results
and chemotherapy, with 35% to 40% of women with values from 18 to 23 getting chemotherapy and with more
than 60% of women with values from 24 to 30 getting
chemotherapy. Among those with a high Recurrence
Score, the use of chemotherapy was less variable, with its
frequency ranging from 80% to 100%. We observed similar patterns of increasing use of chemotherapy with increasing Recurrence Score when we compared subgroups with
node-positive disease and node-negative disease.
Having positive lymph nodes was associated with
greater chemotherapy use in low- and intermediate-risk
women (see Supporting Table 1 [see online supporting
information]). We found no difference in the use of adjuvant chemotherapy between women with micrometastatic lymph node involvement (N1mic) and women with
cancer in 1 to 3 lymph nodes (N1). We combined these
2 categories for subsequent analyses.

All women were diagnosed with stage I or II, estrogen receptor– and/or progesterone receptor–positive cancer. Two logistic regression models (one for the
low-Recurrence Score group and the other for the intermediate Recurrence Score group) were used to calculate adjusted odds ratios, with the receipt of adjuvant chemotherapy used as the dependent variable and with all listed sociodemographic and clinical characteristics used as independent variables. Statistically significant odds ratios are bolded. We evaluated the following independent variables in a preliminary model but excluded them from the final models
because they were not statistically significantly associated with adjuvant chemotherapy use: diagnosis year, marital status, state of residence at diagnosis,
urban location versus rural location, median household income, out-of-pocket pharmacy cost, and prior cancer other than breast cancer.
The models excluded cases categorized as “other or missing race” (n 5 17) and/or “missing histological grade” (n 5 63).

We examined the receipt of chemotherapy in each
Recurrence Score group separately (Table 2). The Recurrence Score value was strongly and positively associated
with chemotherapy receipt in both the low- and
intermediate-risk groups after adjustments for all other
covariates (adjusted odds ratios, 1.17 [95% confidence
interval, 1.09-1.25] and 1.20 [95% confidence interval,
1.15-1.26], respectively). We observed a substantial
decline in the use of chemotherapy with increasing age at
diagnosis in both groups. In the low-risk group, other factors positively associated with the use of chemotherapy
were positive nodes and a higher stage. In the
intermediate-risk group, a higher stage, a worse histological grade, and comorbidity were associated with more frequent use of adjuvant chemotherapy after adjustments. In
4066

the intermediate-risk group, non-Hispanic black women
were less likely to receive chemotherapy than white
women (adjusted odds ratio, 0.22; 95% confidence interval, 0.08-0.60). In the high-Recurrence Score group,
none of these factors were associated with chemotherapy
receipt (model not shown).
Impact of GEP Testing on Overall Use of
Adjuvant Chemotherapy

Overall, 40% of the cohort of women eligible for GEP testing (n 5 9405) received adjuvant chemotherapy in 2006;
this declined to 34% in 2010 and 2011 (P < .001). This
declining trend in chemotherapy by calendar year was also

untested women to receive chemotherapy if they had been
diagnosed with stage I disease, whereas the reverse association was observed for stage II after adjustments for all

other factors (Fig. 3). We observed the same but slightly

DISCUSSION
To our knowledge, this is the largest population-based
study of GEP testing effects on the use of adjuvant chemotherapy reflecting general practice settings. We found that
adjuvant chemotherapy use usually followed recommended GEP testing guidelines. There was a strong association between low and high Recurrence Score results
and the avoidance and use of adjuvant chemotherapy,
respectively. It is reassuring that 89% of the tested women
in these 2 groups were managed consistently with the test
result interpretation.
In the group with less certainty regarding the value
of adjuvant chemotherapy (women with intermediate
Recurrence Score values), less than half (47%) received
chemotherapy. Other important factors associated with
risk, such as younger age, higher stage, and higher tumor
grade, were independently associated with the receipt of
adjuvant chemotherapy in this group. A prospective clinical trial of node-negative women with intermediate
Recurrence Score results (Trial Assigning Individualized
Options for Treatment [TAILORx]) is designed to
address the efficacy of chemotherapy in women with
Recurrence Score values from 11 to 25, but results are still
pending.17
A systematic review of more than 4000 women who
received testing in mostly academic institutions found a
distribution of 49%, 39%, and 12% for patients in the
low-, intermediate-, and high-risk groups, respectively,
and this is similar to what we observed.13 Our finding that
women under the age of 40 years had a somewhat larger
proportion of high Recurrence Score values than older
women is consistent with prior reports showing that the
average risk of recurrence for women under the age of 40
years is somewhat higher than that for older women.18
Our finding that more black women tended to have
higher risk disease is consistent with a prior study reporting that black women were twice as likely to be at high
risk of recurrence than white women.19
We observed previously unreported patterns of
chemotherapy use within the low- and intermediateRecurrence Score groups, with increasing use of adjuvant
chemotherapy with rising scores. There was a strong, linear, positive relation between the Recurrence Score value
and the receipt of adjuvant chemotherapy after adjustments for all other factors. This finding suggests that
oncologists and patients are basing chemotherapy decisions on test results in this tested subgroup in a manner
4068

that is largely consistent with the recommended test interpretation. The increasing use of adjuvant chemotherapy
among low-risk women also demonstrates the clinically
appropriate interpretation that a higher score merits more
consideration of adjuvant chemotherapy. This pattern
suggests that oncologists are using the entire range of
scores within the low-risk group combined with risk factors to guide treatment decisions. Our findings of intragroup variation in chemotherapy use may also be partly
explained by some oncologists using Recurrence Score
value ranges to define risk groups different than the ranges
that we used for this study. For example, the TAILORx
trial adopted an Recurrence Score range of 11 to 25 as intermediate risk for randomization to chemotherapy (or
not), whereas women with a score less than 11 are considered low-risk and may consider forgoing chemotherapy.17
A secondary objective of that trial is to assess the benefits
of therapy for patients at each value in this range to potentially determine a more precise cut point when chemoendocrine therapy is superior to endocrine therapy alone.
We found consistently higher chemotherapy use in
women with low or intermediate Recurrence Score values
who had a higher risk of recurrence based on established
risk factors. Some of these differences were large in absolute terms but not statistically significant in our adjusted
analysis, in part because of small sample sizes. For example, we observed a more than 3-fold higher rate of chemotherapy use (statistically significant) in women with lowrisk, node-positive disease versus low-risk, node-negative
disease.
We found no significant differences in adjuvant
chemotherapy use among women with N1mic disease versus those with N1 disease. We initially compared these
groups because women with N1mic disease, but not N1
disease, are included in practice guidelines for consideration of testing. Adjuvant chemotherapy use was higher
with increasing Recurrence Score values in all women
with node-positive disease. This finding indicates that
chemotherapy administration in tested women is consistent with practice recommendations, regardless of nodal
status. There are validation data supporting the potential
utility of the assay in some patients with frank N1 disease.20,21 A prospective randomized trial is underway to
assess the efficacy of chemotherapy in women with positive nodes.22
Our study cohort included 78 women with HER2positive disease (women who should not be assayed according to guidelines). It is possible that these women were
purposely tested outside guidelines, but we speculate that
this was more likely due to uncertainty about the initial
Cancer

HER2 determination or to the 21-gene Recurrence Score
test being ordered before the availability of HER2 results.
The inclusion of these 78 selected cases assayed for HER2
likely explains why we did not observe any association
between HER2 status and chemotherapy use in Table 2.
We explored whether several nonclinical factors were
associated with testing and chemotherapy use. We found
only 1 statistically significant factor associated with chemotherapy use: black women with intermediate-risk disease
were significantly less likely to receive adjuvant chemotherapy than white women with intermediate-risk disease. This
finding is novel but may not suggest the existence of a
health disparity because there is less certainty about the
benefit of adjuvant chemotherapy for those with intermediate Recurrence Score values. Our finding is based on only
29 black women with intermediate Recurrence Score values, and further confirmation is required in larger cohorts.
We observed a statistically significantly declining
trend in adjuvant chemotherapy use in the entire eligible
cohort. This decline is consistent with the literature, which
suggests that approximately 33% of tested women have a
change in treatment recommendations after 21-gene
Recurrence Score testing.13 Most studies show a shift in
recommendations from chemohormonal therapy to hormone therapy alone.23,24 We detected significant but differential associations of test use on chemotherapy use
according to both the stage at diagnosis and the ER/PR status. These findings likely reflect strong selection factors for
test use related to prognosis. Some oncologists may be
more inclined to test stage I patients whom they were considering for chemotherapy, such as younger patients or
those with higher grade tumors, and not order tests for
patients whom they intend to treat with hormone therapy
alone on the basis of more favorable clinicopathologic features or patient aversion to chemotherapy. However,
because only 25% of our study cohort underwent the
21-gene Recurrence Score test, it is unlikely that we could
detect the specific impact of 21-gene Recurrence Score testing on overall trends in chemotherapy use. Although GEP
testing was increasing, there was also accumulating evidence that many ER-positive, node-negative patients might
be treated effectively with hormone therapy alone.25
Our study has several limitations. We were unable to
account for potentially important patient factors such as
health status and risk factors for complications from chemotherapy. Statistical adjustments cannot fully account for
these missing variables. Second, we studied just 1 GEP
test, the 21-gene Recurrence Score test. However, there is
more accumulated validation evidence for the 21-gene
Recurrence Score test versus other available GEP tests, and

it is specifically endorsed by the most cited US practice
guidelines.2,3 Finally, our study may have limited generalizability because our sample was limited to women less
than 65 years old with commercial health insurance. However, test use is less common in women over the age of 65
years, primarily because older women are far less likely to
receive adjuvant chemotherapy.26 However, our study also
is the largest for this age group and thus greatly expands
the understanding of the practice of community oncologists because prior studies of GEP testing and treatment
have been mostly conducted in academic settings.
In conclusion, tumor genome testing has become an
increasing research focus for identifying ways to better tailor cancer treatments to optimize patient survival and
minimize side effects. We found that in women with
early-stage BC who undergo GEP testing and who are
identified as low- or high-risk, adjuvant chemotherapy
use after testing is generally consistent with the recommended test interpretation for women with a high or low
predicted risk of recurrence. Chemotherapy use in the
intermediate-risk group increased with Recurrence Score
values, and evidence from ongoing randomized trials may
help to clarify whether this finding reflects optimal interpretation of GEP test results. These results demonstrate
the principle that genomic testing, on the basis of research
establishing its utility, can be applied appropriately in
general practice in accordance with guideline recommendations. However, it is important to clarify that our results
showed appropriate GEP test interpretation only when
the test had been ordered. In our eligible cohort, we
observed that less than 30% of eligible women were
tested. Thus, a critical issue is understanding when and
why the GEP test is not ordered and further ensuring that,
with increasing use of GEP tests, physicians continue to
apply test results correctly.
