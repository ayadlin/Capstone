Abstract
Human breast cancer (HBC) cell growth suppression by
okadaic acid (OA) was previously found to involve elevated
expression of oncogenes c-myc and c-fos and apoptosis. Since,
c-Myc influences diverse pathways of cell growth, we hypothesized that elevated levels of c-Myc are involved in HBC
growth suppression. Here, we investigated whether induction
of c-Myc by OA or protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide
contributed to HBC growth inhibition and the mechanisms
involved. OA, cycloheximide, or the chemotherapeutic drug
Taxol suppressed HBC cell growth. However, OA or cycloheximide treatments over 6 or 10 h, respectively, induced c-Myc
expression. Depletion of c-Myc, on the other hand, resulted in
enhanced HBC cell viabilities when exposed to OA or
cycloheximide, but not by Taxol. OA induced c-myc transcription by targeting an 80-bp region from positions 11 to +70,
relative to the P1 transcription start of mouse c-myc
promoter. Gel mobility shift assays revealed binding of HBC
cell nuclear proteins to the OA-responsive c-myc promoter
fragment, whereas binding of one complex was elevated in the
case of the OA-treated or cycloheximide-treated HBC cell
nuclear extracts. Database search revealed presence of a
consensus sequence for zinc finger protein gut-enriched
Kruppel-like factor (GKLF) in OA-responsive region of the
c-myc promoter. Mutation of GKLF consensus sequences
abrogated OA responsiveness of the c-myc promoter, and OA
treatments caused enhanced expression of GKLF in HBC cells.
Thus, OA-dependent attenuation of HBC growth is accomplished, in part, by zinc finger transcription factor GKLFmediated enhanced transcription of c-myc. [Cancer Res

Introduction
The myc oncogene plays a central role in proliferation and
malignant transformation of human and animal cells by influencing diverse pathways of growth, differentiation, genomic stability,
cell cycle control, and apoptosis (1, 2). The three myc genes N-myc,
L-myc, and c-myc are differentially expressed in mammalian
development. The c-Myc, however, is the most potent in effecting
cellular transformation, as well as causing lymphoid tumors in the
transgenic mice (3). The c-myc gene is transcribed as three mRNAs
that give rise to c-Myc1, c-Myc2, and c-MycS proteins. The 62-kDa
c-Myc2 protein is the major form with the N-terminal transactivation domain that contains two regions called Myc homology

boxes I and II, which are highly conserved among members of myc
family. The carboxyl terminus of the c-Myc proteins contains a
basic region and a helix-loop-helix/leucine zipper (HLH/LZ)
domain. The HLH/LZ domain functions in heterodimerization of
c-Myc with another transcription factor Max that serves as an
obligate heterodimeric partner for both the Myc and Mad families
of proteins. The Myc/Max heterodimer binds to the c-Myc
consensus sequence called E-box present in the regulatory regions
of the c-Myc target genes (1, 4).
The c-Myc regulates cell cycle, in principle, by activating genes
that are positive regulators of the cell cycle, as well as
concomitantly suppressing expression of growth inhibitory genes.
For example, c-Myc stimulates transcription of genes, such as
cyclins D1, D2, E, and A; cdk4, e2f1, e2f 2, cdc25A, and b; etc. (ref. 1
and references therein). However, only cdk4, e2f 2, and cyclins D1
and D2 contain canonical E-box sequences in their regulatory
regions. Thus, E-box–independent mechanisms are likely used by
c-Myc to activate expression of its target genes. On the other hand,
c-Myc suppresses transcription of growth inhibitory genes, such as
gadd45, cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors p21WAF1/CIP1 and
p27 Kip1 (ref. 1 and references therein). The cellular transformation
by c-Myc is thought to be the consequence of its aberrant or
genetically altered expression. The role of c-Myc in transformation
is further highlighted by the fact that it regulates expression of the
human telomerase transcriptase (hTERT) gene through the E-box
sequences located in the promoter of the hTERT gene (5, 6).
Moreover, estrogen activates hTERT, in part, via its activation of
expression of c-Myc (6), whereas Mad causes transcriptional
suppression of hTERT (7). Thus, c-Myc–dependent transformation
may be attributed to its aberrant expression coupled with its
induction of the positive regulators of cell cycle and concomitant
suppression of the growth inhibitory genes.
Expression of c-Myc is regulated at transcriptional, posttranscriptional, as well as posttranslational levels. Multiple pathways,
including Ras signaling, are known to regulate c-Myc expression at
posttranslational level by modulating its phosphorylation at
specific residues during cell cycle progression (8). At the late G1
phase of the cell cycle, the phosphorylated c-Myc is targeted by
protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) that results in enhanced dephosphorylation of c-Myc and its subsequent degradation by ubiquitinmediated pathway (8). Inhibition of PP2A by agents such as okadaic
acid (OA2; a specific inhibitor of PP1 and PP2A), on the other hand,
interferes with dephosphorylation of c-Myc, resulting in its elevated
expression (9). Although global inhibition of PP2A often results in
enhanced transformation of cells (10), exposure to OA has also been
shown to inhibit cell growth in part by stimulating apoptosis
(11, 12). However, the precise nature of the pathways targeted by
OA and potential role of c-Myc in OA-dependent cell growth suppression signaling remain to be elucidated.
A number of studies have indicated involvement of c-Myc in cell
growth inhibition pathways, including apoptosis. However, the

translational elongation, and protein synthesis, whereas Taxol
inhibits cell growth in part by targeting microtubule assembly,
resulting in inhibition of mitosis, cell cycle arrest, and apoptosis
(14, 15). All of these agents attenuated HBC cell growth, whereas
only OA or cycloheximide caused elevated expression of c-Myc. We
speculated that elevated expression of c-Myc serves as one of the
triggers leading to cell growth suppression by agents, such as OA or
cycloheximide. Our investigation revealed that depletion of c-Myc
abrogated the growth inhibitory effects of OA or cycloheximide,
but not Taxol. OA targets zinc finger transcription factor gutenriched Kruppel-like factor (GKLF) to stimulate c-myc, which, in
turn, contributes to HBC growth inhibition. Because cell growth
signaling pathways are target of many current anticancer therapies,
identification of regulators of c-Myc–dependent growth suppression signaling, such as GKLF, has potential to facilitate development of strategies for effective targeting of breast cancer.

Materials and Methods
mechanisms underlying growth suppression by c-Myc are yet to be
fully defined. The c-Myc–dependent apoptosis concerns mainly the
systems in which its expression has been induced by transfection,
viral infection, or promoter-driven transgene methodologies (13).
Both p53-dependent, as well as independent, pathways have been
suggested in c-Myc–induced apoptosis in different experimental
systems. To further define the role of c-Myc in cell growth
suppression, we used human breast cancer (HBC) cells in
conjunction with OA. Additional agents, such as cycloheximide,
as well as chemotherapeutic Taxol, that target cellular pathways
different from that of OA were also used to investigate involvement
of c-Myc in suppression of cell growth induced by these agents.
Cycloheximide-dependent growth inhibitory effects involve targeting of peptidyl transferase activity of the 60S ribosome, blocking of

cells were cultured in RPMI media supplemented with 10% FBS. Cells were
plated either in a 100-mm dish at a density of 2  106 cells per dish or in sixwell tissue culture plates at a density of 2  105 cells per well. The cells were
transfected with phosphorylated Rous sarcoma virus-h (pRSV-h), which
encodes for h-galactosidase, in combination with different luciferase
constructs (see below), and h-galactosidase and luciferase activities were
measured essentially as described (17). In addition, MDA-MB-468 HBC cells
were transfected with a plasmid encoding c-Myc antisense, and stable
sublines were isolated and characterized as detailed before (16).
RNA isolation and Northern and Western blot analyses. Logarithmically growing cells were either untreated or treated with OA, Taxol, or
cycloheximide. The cells were then harvested, cellular RNAs were isolated,
and 20 Ag of each of the RNAs were analyzed by Northern blot analyses, in
conjunction with radio-labeled cDNA probes, essentially as described (17).
In addition, both the floating and adherent cells were harvested and lysed,
and the protein extracts were analyzed by Western immunoblotting with
anti–c-myc antibody (PharMingen) and subsequently with anti-actin
antibody (Sigma Biochemicals), essentially as per the manufacturer’s
guidelines and our previously described protocols (18).

measuring the ‘‘enrichment factor’’ indicating the level of apoptosis,
essentially by the manufacturer suggested formula and our previously

Flow cytometric analysis. Flow cytometric analysis of DNA content was
done to assess the cell cycle phase distribution as described previously (19).
Normally growing parental wild-type, the vector plasmid pcDNA3 transfected, or c-Myc–antisense clone 3 and clone 6 sublines were independently
stained for DNA content using propidium iodide. After staining, cells were
analyzed on a Becton Dickinson FACScan cytometer. The data were
analyzed using the multicycle program from Phoenix Flow Systems.
Plasmids and cDNA probes. The plasmids having mouse c-myc
promoter ( 1,100 to +580, 424 to +580, 140 to +340, and +70 to +160
relative to the P1 transcription site) driving luciferase reporter gene (20) were
kindly provided by Dr. George Stark of the Cleveland Clinic. The plasmid
pcDNA3-Myc containing the entire c-Myc-2 open reading frame has been
described before (16). The c-Myc promoter subfragments were PCR amplified
using the plasmid 1,138 to +580 Luc as template, and a combination of
oligos Myc 5 (5¶ CTCCCCGGGCTCCCGAGTTCCCAAAGCAG 3¶; sense oligo
from positions 140 to 120) and Myc 7 (5¶ CTCCTCGAGTACTACAGCGAGTCAGAAAA 3¶; antisense oligo from positions +156 to +175) or Myc 6
(5¶ CTCCCCGGGGCGGCCGAGGACCCCTGGCT 3¶; sense oligo from positions 11 to +10) and Myc 7. The XmaI plus XhoI cut PCR products were
ligated into pGL2-Basic (Promega) vector plasmid to obtain 140 to +175 Luc
and 11 to +175 Luc constructs. In addition, c-myc promoter fragment from
positions 11 to + 70 was PCR amplified using oligo Myc 6 in combination
with oligo Myc 8 (5¶ CTCAAGCTTCCCTTCAGGAGGCAGGAG 3¶; antisense
oligo from positions +55 to +72), digested with XmaI plus HindIII, and ligated
into vector plasmid pBSK to obtain pBSK–c-Myc clone 1. Next, mutations in
the GKLF consensus sequence were introduced by a PCR-based strategy. A
65-nucleotide primer, Myc 9 (5¶ CTCAAGCTTCCCTTCAGGAGGCAGGAGGGGAGCTGAGATTTTTTTATCGGACCCGGCAGCTGAGA 3¶; antisense

using oligos Myc 6 and Myc 9 was then subcloned into vector plasmids pBSK
to obtain pBSK–c-Myc (mut) clone 1. The inserts of pBSK–c-Myc clone 1 and
pBSK–c-Myc (mut) clone 1 plasmids were then subcloned into pGL2promoter plasmid (Promega) to obtain 11 to +70 (wt) SV40-Luc and 11 to
+70 (mut) SV40-Luc constructs, respectively.
In addition, a 310-bp GKLF cDNA fragment was PCR amplified using
reverse transcribed RNA from MDA-MB-468 HBC cells and a combination
of oligos GKLF-1 (5¶ AGAGAATTCAGTATTTTTTACTTTTCACAC 3¶; sense
oligo from positions 1,777 to 1,806; ref. 21) and GKLF-2 (5¶ AGGGAATTCTGGTCTTCCCTCCCCCAAC 3¶; antisense oligo from positions 2,061 to
2,088; ref. 21). The PCR DNA was digested with EcoRI and cloned into vector
plasmid pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) to obtain pcDNA3-GKLF clone 1. Further,
a 48-bp subfragment of p21WAF1/CIP1 3¶ untranslated region (UTR; positions
+892 to +939; ref. 23) was generated by synthesizing 52-mer each of the
sense and antisense oligos. These oligos were phosphorylated by using T4
polynucleotide kinase and annealed, and the double-stranded subfragment
was subcloned into vector plasmid pBSK to obtain pBSK-WAF clone 42.C.12.
All the plasmids used in this report were sequenced to confirm the validity of
the inserts and are summarized in Table 1. The 310-bp GKLF cDNA fragment
of pcDNA3-GKLF clone 1 plasmid was excised by digestion with EcoRI, gel
purified, and subsequently used as radio-labeled probe for Northern blot
hybridization.
Gel electrophoretic mobility shift assays. The c-myc promoter
fragment from positions 11 to +72 was radiolabeled by end-filling using
Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase and [a-32P]dCTP, followed by its
purification on G-50 sephadex spin column. Nuclear protein extracts from
untreated, as well as OA-treated or cycloheximide-treated, HBC cells were
prepared, DNA-protein binding was carried out in vitro, and DNA-bound
complexes were analyzed by gel electrophoretic mobility shift assays as
described before (17, 24, 25). The specific competitor DNA consist gel-

purified c-myc promoter fragment from positions 11 to +72, whereas the
nonspecific competitor DNA consist 48-bp gel-purified p21WAF1/CIP1 3¶ UTR
fragment of plasmid pBSK-WAF clone 42.C.12. The binding reactions were
electrophoresed onto 5% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels, the gels were
dried at 60jC, and DNA-protein binding was visualized by autoradiography.

Results
OA and cycloheximide enhance c-myc expression in HBC
cells. Agents such as OA, cycloheximide, or Taxol attenuate growth
of diverse cell types in part by causing apoptosis (11, 12, 14, 15). To
investigate mechanisms of HBC growth suppression by these
agents, HBC cells were exposed to 120 nmol/L OA, 0.7 mmol/L
cycloheximide, or 30 Amol/L Taxol for varying periods of time,
followed by determination of cell viability using MTT assay.
Treatments with OA for 6 h, cycloheximide for 10 h, or Taxol for
36 h resulted in f80% loss in viability of HBC cells (Fig. 1A–C). The
loss of cell viability by these agents was due, in part, to apoptotic
cell death as evidenced by fragmented cell nuclei of the treated
cells (not shown), suggesting that apoptosis contributes to reduced
cell viabilities by each of the agent. Next, HBC cells were treated
with either 120 nmol/L OA for 6 h or 0.7 mmol/L cycloheximide for
10 h. Untreated, as well as treated, cells were then harvested, and
total RNAs were isolated and analyzed by Northern blot
hybridization to determine c-myc expression. Treatments with
OA or cycloheximide caused increased expression of c-myc mRNA
(Fig. 1D, lanes 3, 4, 7, and 8), consistent with our observations of
elevated c-myc levels by OA in the ER-negative MDA-MB-435 (17)

and ER-positive MCF-7 HBC cells (not shown). Treatments with
Taxol, however, failed to increase c-myc mRNA levels in HBC cells
(not shown). Data in Fig. 1 suggest that, although all the agents
used in this study suppressed growth of HBC cells, c-Myc
expression was likely associated with HBC cell growth inhibitory
effects of OA or cycloheximide.
c-Myc expression plays a role in HBC growth suppression by
OA or cycloheximide. Whether elevated levels of c-Myc play a
role in inhibition of HBC cell growth by OA or cycloheximide was
investigated by using c-Myc antisense sublines that express
reduced levels of c-Myc. Two sublines, c-Myc antisense clone 3
and clone 6 that express 50% reduced levels of c-Myc when
compared with their vector-transfected or wild-type counterparts
were isolated and characterized by us before (16). Given that
c-Myc targets diverse pathways of cell cycle control, we first
determined whether loss of c-Myc causes alterations in cell cycle
progression of c-Myc antisense sublines. These sublines, along
with their wild-type or vector-transfected counterparts, were
subjected to flow cytometric analysis after labeling with
propidium iodide. Reduced expression of c-Myc did not alter
cell cycle phase distribution, as well as DNA content of c-Myc
antisense HBC cells (not shown). Next, we determined whether
loss of c-Myc interferes with the growth inhibitory effects of OA,
cycloheximide, or Taxol. Wild-type MDA-MB-468 HBC cells, the
vector pcDNA3 clone 1, or the c-Myc antisense clones 3 and 6
HBC sublines were independently treated with either 120 nmol/L
OA for 6 h, 0.7 mmol/L cycloheximide for 10 h, or 30 Amol/L
Taxol for 36 h, and their viabilities were determined by MTT
assays. As expected, each of the agents caused up to f80% loss
of viability of wild-type or vector-transfected HBC cells. In
contrast, treatments with cycloheximide or OA, but not with
Taxol, failed to significantly reduce viabilities of c-Myc antisense
cells (Fig. 2A–C). The failure of OA to attenuate viability of c-Myc
antisense HBC cells was due, in part, to the reduced apoptosis

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (21). November 1, 2007

when compared with OA-dependent apoptosis in the vectortransfected controls (Fig. 2D). Data in Fig. 2 indicate that loss of
c-Myc interferes with HBC growth inhibitory effects of OA.
The extent levels of c-Myc contribution to growth inhibitory
effects of OA was investigated next by using c-Myc antisense clone
3 and clone 6 HBC cells. These cells were either untreated or
independently treated with 120 nmol/L of OA for various periods of
time, followed by determination of their viabilities. As shown in
Fig. 3A and B, OA treatments for periods of 6 and 12 h resulted in
minimal, statistically insignificant loss in their viabilities when
compared with the viabilities of their untreated counterparts.
Exposure to OA for periods of >18 h, however, resulted in
significant loss of their viability, to the extent that only f20% or
less viable cells were present when OA treatments were extended to
36 and 48 h of time periods (Fig. 3A and B). Whether growth
suppression of c-Myc antisense cells by OA over 36 to 48 h of time
periods involves c-Myc expression was investigated by Western
immunoblot analyses. Wild-type HBC cells or their vector-transfected counterparts were either untreated or treated with OA for
6 h, whereas c-Myc antisense sublines were either untreated or
treated with OA for 12, 36, and 48 h. The Western blot analysis
revealed that although 6-h treatments with OA caused elevated
expression of c-Myc in the wild-type or the vector-transfected HBC
cells, exposure of c-Myc antisense cells to OA for 12 h failed to
increase c-Myc levels. The c-Myc antisense cells that were exposed
to OA for 36 or 48 h, on the other hand, displayed elevated levels of
c-Myc (Fig. 3C and D). The data in Figs. 2 and 3 suggest that
increased expression of c-Myc is involved in OA-dependent HBC
growth inhibition, whereas loss of c-Myc interferes with growth
inhibitory effects of OA.
OA targets c-Myc expression, in part, by transcriptional
mechanisms. Because OA induced c-Myc mRNA (Fig. 1D), as well
as protein (Fig. 3C and D), we speculated that this increase in
c-myc expression was due, in part, to transcriptional mechanisms.

Cell Growth Suppression by c-Myc

To test this possibility, we used various c-myc promoter constructs
listed in Table 1. HBC cells were transfected with various c-myc
promoter constructs in combination with h-galactosidase expression plasmid. First, the plasmids 1,138 to +580 Luc, 424 to +580
Luc, 140 to +340 Luc, 140 to +175 Luc, 11 to +175 Luc, and +70
to +164 Luc were separately transfected into MDA-MB-468 HBC
cells. In certain cases, f40 h posttransfection, the cells were
treated with 120 nmol/L OA for 6 h, and both the controls and
treated cultures were harvested and assayed for luciferase
activities. All the constructs, except +70 to +164 Luc, elicited
f2.5-fold to 3.5-fold increase in the luciferase activities in the
presence of OA (Fig. 4A and B), suggesting that 11 to +70 region
of mouse c-myc gene harbors OA-responsive elements. The OA
responsiveness of the 11 to +70 c-myc promoter subfragment was
further evaluated by using additional HBC, as well as colon
carcinoma HCT-116 and prostate carcinoma PC-3, cells. First,
various HBC cells were transfected with the 11 to +175 Luc
construct, and luciferase activities in the absence or presence of
OA were determined. As expected, OA caused f3-fold to 5-fold
increase in luciferase activities of 11 to +175 Luc construct
(Fig. 4C). Whether OA also stimulates c-myc promoter in HCT116 and PC-3 cells was investigated next. The plasmids 11 to
+175 Luc or +70 to +164 Luc were transfected in these cells, and
luciferase activities in the absence or presence of OA were
determined. Consistent with our data in Fig. 4B, OA stimulated
activity of 11 to +175 Luc plasmid in these cells (Fig. 4D). Data in

Fig. 4 strongly suggest that OA targets c-myc promoter sequences
within positions 11 to +70 in a cell type–independent fashion.
OA and cycloheximide target HBC nuclear protein(s) that
specifically interact with OA-responsive c-myc promoter
sequences. HBC cells were either untreated, treated with
120 nmol/L OA for 6 h, or treated with 0.7 mmol/L cycloheximide
for 10 h, and the nuclear protein extracts were prepared as in
Materials and Methods. Gel electrophoretic mobility shift assays
were used to investigate binding of HBC nuclear proteins in vitro
with the OA-responsive region of the c-myc promoter. As shown in
Fig. 5, the 11 to +72 subfragment binds multiple complexes
present in the nuclear extracts of all the HBC cells (lanes 2, 4, 5, 7, 8,
10, 11, 13, 14, 16, 17, and 19). The DNA-protein(s) binding was
competed away by 200-fold molar excess of the unlabeled doublestranded 11 to +72 DNA fragment (lanes 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, and 18),
whereas the binding could not be competed away by a 200-fold
molar excess of double-stranded 48 bp of cDNA p21WAF1/CIP1
3¶ UTR (positions 892–939; ref. 23) subfragment (lanes 4, 7, 10, 13,
16, and 19). Increased binding of a high molecular weight complex
(location denoted by * in Fig. 5) was noted in the case nuclear
protein extracts obtained from HBC cells treated with either
120 nmol/L OA (A, lanes 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, and 19; B, lanes 5 and 7) or
with 0.7 mmol/L cycloheximide (B, lanes 11 and 13). The data in
Fig. 5 suggest that OA or cycloheximide cause enhanced binding
of specific HBC nuclear proteins to the OA-responsive c-myc
promoter sequences.

OA-responsive c-myc promoter sequences. Preparation of
the nuclear proteins, their binding with radio-labeled

7, 11 to 13, and 17to 19, and (B), lanes 5 to 7, were derived
from the HBC cells treated with 120 nmol/L OA for 6 h,

c-myc promoter (underlined, bold block

mutant GKLF cis sequences. B, HBC cells
were transfected with the indicated
luciferase constructs in combination with
pRSV-h. Approximately 40 h after
transfections, the cells were either
untreated ( OA ) or treated with
120 nmol/L OA (+OA ) for 6 h,
and luciferase and h-galactosidase
activities were measured as in Materials
and Methods. The luciferase activities were
expressed as light units and normalized to
h-galactosidase activities expressed as
absorbance. Columns, means of three
independent experiments expressed
relative to luciferase activities obtained
from untreated controls, which were
arbitrarily defined as 1; bars , SE. C, HBC
cells were either untreated (lane 1), treated
with 120 nmol/L OA for 0.5, 1, 2, 4, and
6 h (lanes 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6, respectively),
followed by RNA extraction and Northern
blot hybridization with radiolabeled GKLF
cDNA probe as in Materials and Methods.
Ethidium bromide stain of the RNA gel
is also shown to assess RNA loading,
as indicated by the signals for 28S and 18S
rRNAs.

OA increases c-myc expression, in part, by targeting GKLF.
Database search revealed the presence of a consensus sequence for
zinc finger transcription factor GKLF in the OA-responsive 11
to +70 c-myc promoter subfragment (Fig. 6A). Whether GKLF
consensus sequences are involved in OA-dependent increase in
c-myc promoter activities in HBC cells was investigated next. The
plasmids SV40-Luc (pGL2-Promoter, Promega), 11 to +70 (wt)
SV40-Luc, or 11 to +70 (mut) SV40-Luc in combination with
plasmid pRSV-h were independently transfected into MDA-MB-468
HBC cells. The cells were either untreated or treated with 120
nmol/L OA for 6 h, followed by assays for luciferase and hGal
activities. OA caused f2.0-fold increase in luciferase activities of
11 to +70 (wt) SV40-Luc, whereas no significant increase in
luciferase activities was noted for either SV40-Luc or 11 to +70
(mut) SV40-Luc (Fig. 6B), suggesting that OA stimulates c-myc
promoter, in part, by targeting GKLF consensus sequences. The
zinc finger transcription factor GKLF was revealed as a target of OA
by Northern blot analysis, wherein MDA-MB-468 HBC cells treated
with 120 nmol/L OA for 6 h were found to have increased levels of
GKLF mRNA (Fig. 6C). Together, the data in Fig. 6 strongly suggest
that elevated expression of c-myc by OA involves the zinc finger
transcription factor GKLF.

Discussion
We have previously observed that submicromolar doses of OA
stimulated c-myc expression in HBC cells (17). Here, we tested a
hypothesis that cellular level of c-Myc is a critical regulator of
signaling pathways regulating cell growth, and expression of c-Myc
beyond a threshold may cause growth suppression of the target cells.

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (21). November 1, 2007

By using HBC sublines that express antisense mediated reduced
levels of c-Myc (16), we show that loss of c-Myc interferes with their
growth attenuation by OA. Although, depletion of c-Myc did not
cause alterations in the cell cycle phase distribution or the DNA
contents of these cells, prolonged exposure to OA, nevertheless,
resulted in elevated c-Myc and their growth suppression (see Fig. 3).
These observations support a compelling argument that expression
of c-Myc beyond a threshold likely attenuates HBC cell growth.
Given that OA is also a tumor promoter and activates activator
protein (AP-1)–mediated signaling in different cell types, including
HBC cells (ref. 17 and references therein), it is conceivable that OA
stimulation of c-myc transcription entailed aberrant induction of
pathways used by mitogenic stimuli. In this context, c-myc
transcription was found to be regulated by Src kinase using Racdependent pathway (26, 27), by a KH domain protein FKB that
binds an element 1.5 kb upstream of the c-myc promoter (28), by
growth factor pathways involving mitogen-activated protein kinase
(MAPK) signaling, by transcription factors, such as nuclear factornB (NF-nB), E2Fs (ref. 29, and refs. within), or by cytokine signaling
pathways that converge on transcription factors, such as signal
transducers and activators of transcription (STAT; ref. 20 and
references therein). OA-stimulated c-Myc expression in HBC cells,
independent of the transcription factors AP-1, NF-nB, E2F-1, FKB,
or STATs, is supported by the fact that the OA-responsive c-myc
promoter sequences lack consensus elements for any of these
transcription factors. Furthermore, expression of wild-type extracellular signal-regulated kinase 2 (ERK2) or STAT3 (20) proteins
failed to enhance transcriptional activity of 11 to +175 Luc
construct in the presence of OA (not shown). In addition, HBC cells
transfected with 11 to +175 Luc construct that were either treated

Cell Growth Suppression by c-Myc

with OA, a combination of OA and 30 Amol/L PD98059
(pharmacologic inhibitor of MAP/ERK kinase 1) or OA and
25 Amol/L SB203580 [pharmacologic inhibitor of p38 stressactivated protein kinase (SAPK) a/h; ref. 30], also failed to show
differences in activation of c-myc promoter (data not shown). Thus,
OA stimulation of c-Myc in HBC cells is likely independent of
signaling pathways involving STAT3, ERK/MAPK, or p38/SAPK.
Since p38 SAPKs are expressed as multiple isoforms, including p38
a, h, g, and y, and SB203580 has been shown to selectively inhibit
p38 a/h isoforms only (ref. 30 and references therein), it remains to
be determined whether p38 isoforms g and y or c-Jun-NH2-kinase
(JNK) family of SAPKs are involved in stimulation of c-myc
transcription by OA in HBC cells.
Overexpression of c-Myc in the absence of survival signals (such
as growth factors) causes apoptosis (31–34). The induction of
apoptosis by c-Myc involves p53-dependent, as well as independent, pathways (13), including ADP ribosylation factor pathway and
stimulation of cytochrome c release (35, 36). Expression of c-Myc
destabilizes mitochondrial integrity in part by functionally
cooperating with Bax to induce apoptosis, as well as potentiates
the mitochondrial pathways of apoptosis by acting upstream of
apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 in the p38 signaling cascade
(37, 38). In the cells with defective intrinsic apoptosis signaling, cMyc expression sensitizes cells to TRAIL-mediated cell death, in
part, by blocking NF-nB activity (39). Since OA or cycloheximide,
while targeting distinct intracellular signaling by inhibiting PP1/
PP2A or protein synthesis pathway, respectively, causes elevated
expression of c-Myc and cell growth inhibition, it is unclear
whether and to what extent c-Myc in turn targets mitochondria
involving interactions with proteins, such as Bax and cytochrome c
release to promote apoptosis. Nevertheless, since the HBC cells
used in this report possess a mutant nonfunctional p53 (40), OAmediated or cycloheximide-mediated effects likely involve p53independent pathways. Our findings are also consistent with a
study describing a role for c-Myc in DNA damage–induced
apoptosis of a small cell lung cancer cell line independent of the
involvement of p53 (41). A moderate increase in expression of

c-Myc, as well as proapoptotic protein Bax, was noted when the
small cell lung cancer cell line POGB was exposed to the DNAdamaging agents, such as doxorubicin (200 ng/mL) for 18 to 48 h or
g-radiation (8 Gy) for 18 h (41). Although, doxorubicin causes
apoptosis in HBC cells, it, nevertheless, does not induce c-Myc and
Bax proteins.6 The extent OA-dependent or cycloheximidedependent HBC growth inhibition uses DNA damage pathways is
unclear. Apoptosis-inducing stimuli, such as UV and Taxol, have
been found to activate JNK, which, in turn, regulated c-Myc–
mediated apoptosis involving phosphorylation of c-Myc at Ser62
and Ser71 in NIH3T3 cells (42). In addition, oncogene Ras-mediated
phosphorylation of c-Myc at Ser62 has been implicated to regulate
c-Myc stability in the initial stages of cell proliferation (8, 43).
Whether additional posttranslational mechanism(s) are used by OA
to regulate c-Myc expression is a subject of our ongoing studies.
Previously, we found that OA-dependent c-myc expression was
accomplished, in part, by posttranscriptional mechanisms using
adenosine-uridine rich elements (ARE) present in the 3¶ UTR of the
c-myc mRNA (17). OA caused increased binding in vitro of a novel
f75 kDa HBC cell cytosolic protein to c-myc 3¶ UTR sequences
containing AREs. This report shows that OA up-regulates c-Myc by
transcriptional mechanisms involving enhanced binding of HBC
cell nuclear proteins to the OA-responsive elements of the c-myc
promoter (Figs. 4 and 5). Together with our current findings
demonstrating involvement of GKLF in regulating c-Myc expression, our studies not only highlight a pathway regulating complex
OA-dependent growth suppression mechanisms in cancer cells but
also reveal a mediator of signaling with potential to serve as target
for design and development of efficacious anticancer therapeutics.
