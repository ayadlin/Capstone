BACKGROUND. This study was conducted to describe clinicians serving women in
the National Breast and Cervical Cancer Early Detection Program (NBCCEDP)
with regard to demographic and practice characteristics and their usual practices
in cervical cancer screening and abnormal cytology management, as well as
human papillomavirus (HPV) test use.

METHODS. The authors analyzed data from a nationally representative survey
conducted in 2004 of providers practicing 7 specialties that commonly offer cervical cancer screening. The program providers were compared with nonprogram

women age <30 years.

CONCLUSIONS. As of mid-2004, program providers served racially and ethnically
diverse, low-income patients who are at high risk for cervical cancer compared
with nonprogram providers, as intended by this program. Because many providers offered on-site colposcopy, used LBC, and used HPV tests for patients with
abnormal cytology results, they are well equipped to reduce the risk of cervical
cancer. Many program providers used the HPV test for reasons that were not
approved of by the FDA or reimbursed by the NBCCEDP. The results of this survey have informed training materials for program providers, reimbursement policies for LBC and HPV tests, and interventions to discourage inappropriate HPV
testing. (See editorial on pages 000–000, this issue.) Cancer 2007;110:1024–31.

n the U.S., the incidence of cervical cancer is highest among lowincome women, who generally are also less likely to undergo
screening and to get appropriate follow-up of abnormal Papanicolaou (Pap) tests. The National Breast and Cervical Cancer Early
Detection Program (NBCCEDP), administered by the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), helps low-income, uninsured

women gain access to screening and diagnostic services for breast and cervical cancer through cooperative agreements with state and territorial health
departments, tribes, and tribal organizations. The
NBCCEDP gives priority to women with incomes up
to 250% of the federal poverty level who have never
or rarely been screened and have no other coverage
for screening. Since its inception in 1991, nearly 2
million women have been screened through the
NBCCEDP (hereafter called the program), and 61,000
precancerous cervical lesions and 1200 cases of cervical cancer have been detected.1
Each program grantee is responsible for establishing a network of providers that are willing to
serve low-income women with a reimbursement
structure capped at Medicare rates. In general, decisions by the program concerning which services to
reimburse have been consistent with recommendations of the U.S. Preventive Service Task Force
(USPSTF) regarding the age at which to begin Pap
testing, how often to screen, and the populations for
which a Pap test may not generally be needed (eg,
women who have undergone a hysterectomy).2–4
Since 1996, the program has reimbursed both conventional and liquid-based cytology (LBC) at the
Medicare rate for conventional cytology, and since
2002 the program has reimbursed human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA tests (Hybrid Capture 2; Digene
Diagnostics, Gaithersburg, MD) to identify women
who merit immediate colposcopy to evaluate results
from cytologic findings of atypical squamous cells of
undetermined significance (ASC-US). The U.S. Food
and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the HPV
test for this use in 1999,5 and this indication is supported by guidelines of the American Society of Colposcopy and Cytopathology (ASCCP), the American
College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG),
and the CDC.6–8 Providers can order an HPV test
before and contingent on an ASC-US result via reflex
testing (using residual cells from LBC media or using
a separate HPV specimen collected with conventional cytology) or by recalling patients after the
ASC-US result. In 2003, the FDA approved the HPV
test for use as an adjunct to cytology to screen
women aged 30 years to identify persistently HPVinfected women who merit more frequent cytologic
screening.5 This test use was supported as an option
by some organizations such as ACOG and the American Cancer Society (ACS), but not by others such as
USPSTF.4,7,9,10 At the current time, the program does
not reimburse HPV testing when used as an adjunct
to cytology for screening.
Although 1 small qualitative study performed in
2001 examined resistance to extending screening

intervals for cytology among program physicians,2 to
our knowledge no national survey has compared the
characteristics of program providers with those of
providers who do not participate in the program in
terms of their demographic characteristics, the characteristics of their patients, their screening practices,
or their abnormal cytology management practices.
State program directors have suggested that newer
technologies such as LBC and HPV testing are less
likely to be available to women eligible for the program, creating a 2-tiered system in which both providers and women believe that their care is of a
‘‘different’’ standard than that given to women with
private insurance. Moreover, certain states are unable
to recruit providers and laboratories into the program because they do not reimburse LBC at the
Medicare rate for conventional cytology.11 To determine whether screening practices for cervical cancer
differed by participation in the program, we analyzed
a national sample of program and nonprogram providers surveyed in mid-2004.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Because there is no registry of program providers, we
relied on data from a confidential mail survey of 7
clinical specialties that commonly offer cytologic
screening. The survey methods have been described
in detail previously.12,13 This survey included a random sample of family and general practice physicians (FP), internists (IM), obstetrician/gynecologists
(OB/GYN), adolescent medicine physicians (Adol),
nurse practitioners (NP), physician assistants (PA),
and certified nurse midwives (CNM).
We restricted our analyses to the 2980 respondents who indicated they worked 8 hours/week in
outpatient settings, provided routine checkups,
reported that at least 20% of their patients were ages
13 to 65 years, and offered Pap tests. Participation in
the program was determined by the following question: ‘‘Do you provide cervical cancer screening to
low income women for your states or federal Breast
and Cervical Cancer Early Detection Program?’’ We
excluded those who were ‘‘not sure’’ (n 5 607)
because we wanted to compare clinicians who
clearly indicated they were program providers with
clinicians who clearly indicated they were not. We
then classified providers into 3 types: OB/GYN physicians, primary care physicians (FP, IM, and Adol),
and midlevel providers (CNM, NP, and PA). We
defined HPV test use that was not consistent with
FDA-approved indications for cervical cancer screening or management of abnormal cytology results: to
screen for cervical cancer instead of a Pap test; as a

FIGURE 1. Participation in the National Breast and Cervical Cancer Early Detection Program (NBCCEDP) by specialty, 2004 National Provider Survey. The
survey was limited to 2980 clinicians who provided Papanicolaou tests: 333 family or general medicine practitioners, 220 internists, 293 adolescent medicine
specialists, 463 obstetricians/gynecologists (OB/GYN), 591 nurse providers, 622 certified nurse midwives, and 458 physician assistants.

primary screening test for HPV infection; and to
check the HPV infection status of patients with anogenital warts, patients with other sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), or the sex partners of
patients with other STDs, anogenital warts, or abnormal Pap tests. Because patients may have requested
an HPV test for FDA-approved or nonapproved reasons, we did not classify HPV test use due to patient
request as a nonapproved reason. We defined urban
and rural practice sites using zip code data and 2000
Rural-Urban Commuting Area codes.14
We conducted descriptive analyses of provider
demographic and practice characteristics, weighted
for provider specialty and nonresponse, using SAS
software (version 9; SAS Institute, Inc, Cary, NC). We
then compared these characteristics by program participation and provider type using SUDAAN software
(version 9; Research Triangle Institute, Research Triangle Park, NC) to calculate 95% confidence intervals, Student t tests, and chi-square tests for
between-group and within-group comparisons. In all
analyses, a 2-tail P of <.05 was considered statistically significant.

RESULTS
The overall response rate after adjusting for clinicians/
providers who were deceased, retired, or ineligible, and
undeliverable surveys was 82%. The response rate varied by specialty, with a 59% response rate for IMs, a

68% response rate for FPs, a 79% response rate for
Adols, an 81% response rate for OB/GYNs, an 86%
response rate for PAs, a 95% response rate for CNMs,
and a 96% response rate for NPs.
Based on the 2980 providers analyzed, we estimated that 28% of providers (95% confidence interval [95% CI], 26–30%) participated in the program,
52% (95% CI, 49–54%) were not participants, and
21% (95% CI, 18–23%) were not sure or did not indicate whether they participated. This third group was
excluded, leaving 2373 providers for further analyses.
Participation in the program varied markedly by specialty. Among midlevel providers, greater than half of
NPs (52%), greater than one-third of CNMs (35%),
and nearly one-third (28%) of PAs participated.
Among physicians, greater than one-quarter of OB/
GYNs participated, which was a higher proportion
than we found for the other specialties (IM: 23%; FP:
24%; and Adol: 14%) (Fig. 1). Thus, midlevel providers were more likely than physicians to participate
in the program.
Compared with nonprogram providers, program
providers were significantly more likely to be female
(Table 1). Among primary care physicians and midlevel practitioners (but not among OB/GYNs), program
providers were more likely to be female (Table 1).
Program providers, especially primary care physicians, were more likely to be black than nonprogram
providers. Overall, program providers were significantly less likely to have practiced for 10 years or

Program providers were significantly more likely to
work in multispecialty group practices (31% vs 18%)
and to practice in rural communities (32% vs 19%),
and they were significantly less likely to work in the
South (23% vs 38%) and more likely to practice in
the Midwest (30% vs 22%). Overall, program providers were more likely to see patients who are adolescent, female, black, Hispanic, or insured by Medicaid
(Table 2); program providers were also significantly

more likely than nonprogram providers to have provided prenatal care within the past year.

Screening Guidelines and Practices
The guidelines for screening and management most
commonly rated as somewhat or quite valuable by
program providers were those from their specialty
professional organization followed by ACOG, the
CDC, the ACS, the American Medical Association
(AMA), and the health system in which they worked.

Chi-square reflects a comparison of specific row characteristic compared with other row characteristics combined by program status.

Compared with nonprogram providers, significantly
more program providers rated the CDC materials as
valuable (70% vs 59%).
On average, program and nonprogram providers
performed a similar number of Pap tests within the
last year, but program providers saw significantly
more women with abnormal or borderline Pap tests
and were more likely to have onsite colposcopy available (57% vs 40%) (Table 2). Midlevel providers performed a significantly higher number of Pap tests
and saw significantly more patients with abnormal
Pap tests than their nonprogram counterparts.
Among program providers, OB/GYNs performed a
higher volume of Pap tests and saw more patients
with abnormal or borderline cytology compared with
other clinicians.
Program providers were less likely to use LBC as
their sole method for cytology (57% vs 68%), but
were more likely to use both LBC and conventional
cytology (19% vs 11%) (Table 3). Among all providers,

OB/GYNs were more likely than primary care or midlevel practitioners to use LBC alone for screening.
Overall, program providers were significantly
more likely than nonprogram providers to have
ever ordered or collected HPV tests for any reason
(70% vs 64%). This pattern was observed among
midlevel and primary care providers but not among
OB/GYNs, in whom the trend was reversed (Table
3). Among program providers, OB/GYNs were significantly more likely than providers in other specialties to have ever used the HPV test for any
reason.
Approximately one-fifth of providers had ever
used HPV tests as an adjunct to a Pap test for
screening. No differences were noted by program
participation or across specialties among program
providers. However, program OB/GYNs were significantly less likely than nonprogram OB/GYNs to use
HPV testing as an adjunct to cytology. Among the
program providers who used the HPV test for this

status of patients with anogenital warts or other sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) or the sexual partners of patients with other STDs, anogenital warts, or abnormal Pap test results.

reason (n 5 205), fewer reported usually/always
using HPV tests for patients aged 30 years (33%)
(FDA-approved use) than for patients aged <30 years
(45%) (Non-FDA-approved use) (Table 3).

Practices for managing abnormal cytology results
Among all providers, approximately two-thirds of
both program (66%) and nonprogram (62%) providers had ever ordered the HPV test contingent on
abnormal Pap smear results (reflex testing or recalling patients) (Table 3). Among program providers,
OB/GYNs were more likely than providers in other
specialties to use HPV tests for this reason. Nevertheless, program OB/GYNs were significantly less likely
than nonprogram OB/GYNs to report such use.
Among the 1616 providers who had ever used
the HPV test for managing patients with abnormal
cytology results, the proportions usually/always using
the HPV test for ASC-US cytology did not appear to
vary significantly by program participation. In addi-

tion, of the subset of providers (n 5 1539) who had
seen patients with ASC-US cytology and HPV test
results, program and nonprogram providers were
equally likely to recommend prompt colposcopy for
those patients with ASC-US cytology who had a positive HPV test (96% vs 94%) (data not shown), an
indication approved by the FDA and recommended
by national guidelines. A smaller proportion of both
program and nonprogram providers recommended
prompt colposcopy for those patients with ASC-US
cytology and a negative HPV test (29% vs 26%; data
not shown). Program OB/GYNs were significantly
more likely than nonprogram OB/GYNs to recommend prompt colposcopy (24% vs 13%) for such
patients, even though this practice is inconsistent
with guidelines recommending repeat cytology and
HPV testing instead of colposcopy.
Among program providers who had ever used
the HPV test for patients with an abnormal or borderline Pap test, approximately two-thirds usually/

always used the HPV test for patients with higher
grade screening Pap test abnormalities of atypical
squamous cells suspicious for high-grade squamous
intraepithelial lesion (HSIL) (ASC-H), low-grade
squamous intraepithelial lesion (LSIL), and HSIL–
practices that are not FDA approved or currently
recommended by national organizations to triage
patients to colposcopy (Table 3). HPV testing practices for these higher grade cytologic abnormalities
did not differ significantly by program participation.

HPV Testing for Reasons Not Approved by the FDA
Equal proportions of program and nonprogram providers had ever used the HPV test for any of the 5
non-FDA–approved reasons examined (54% vs 55%)
(Table 3). In addition, similar percentages of program
and nonprogram providers had ever used the HPV
test in response to a patient’s request (60% vs 57%).
Midlevel providers in the program were significantly
more likely than nonprogram midlevel providers to
have ordered HPV tests because of a patient’s request
(61% vs 52%).

DISCUSSION
To our knowledge, the current study is the first
national survey of 7 specialties that commonly provide Pap tests that characterizes provider demographics, practices, and cervical cancer screening
and abnormal cytology management patterns, and
compares providers who participate in the NBCCEDP
with providers who do not participate. This survey
shows that in mid-2004, at least one-third of Pap test
providers in the U.S. cared for women served in the
program. Midlevel providers were more likely than
physicians to participate in the program and >50%
of NPs and nearly one-third of CNMs and PAs participated.
Program providers are well poised to serve those
women at the highest risk for cervical cancer in the
U.S.15 because they were more likely than nonprogram providers to serve racially/ethnically diverse,
uninsured, publicly insured, and rural patients. In
addition, program providers were more likely than
nonprogram providers to be female, midlevel practitioners, and racial/ethnic minorities, and to practice
in the public sector or rural settings. These characteristics are associated with a better delivery of preventive and screening services, especially to racial
and ethnic minority patients.16,17 Unfortunately, program providers were less likely to practice in the
South, where cervical cancer rates are highest,15 sug-

gesting a need to increase the program’s reach in this
region.
Many program providers saw patients aged <18
years and provided prenatal care as well as treatment
for STDs. Such visits would offer opportunities to
provide information regarding the prevention of cervical cancer, HPV infection, and other STDs; and vaccines against HPV to female adolescents and young
women.18 Their fairly up-to-date knowledge of the
materials and guidelines of national organizations
that have issued screening and abnormal cytology
management guidelines, including the CDC (the
program’s sponsor), may support accurate patient
education. Previous analyses identified key gaps in
HPV knowledge12 that should be stressed in efforts
to educate program providers–that the majority of
genital HPV infection clears spontaneously, that HPV
genotypes associated with warts and cancer usually
differ, and that anogenital warts do not increase the
risk of cancer.
Although Pap test volume did not differ significantly by program participation, program providers
of all types were less likely than nonprogram providers to use LBC as their sole cytology method. This
is likely due to the fact that until 2007, the program
did not reimburse LBC unless it was billed at the
Medicare rate used for the conventional Pap test. In
fact, survey data showing that the majority of U.S.
providers use LBC supported the NBCCEDP’s new
policy to reimburse LBC at the allowable Medicare
rate. Among program providers, OB/GYNs were
more likely than midlevel practitioners or primary
care physicians to use LBC alone and to use HPV
tests for FDA-approved indications. These differences may result from a greater knowledge of HPV
or HPV tests, the unique practice focus of OB/
GYNs, or targeted commercial marketing. If programs want to increase the use of LBC or HPV tests,
they should prioritize all 3 provider types and
should address possible disincentives to HPV testing. These include outdated HPV knowledge, access
to onsite colposcopy, uncertain or limited reimbursement, or a lack of testing experience or counseling resources.
Program providers tended to have more patients
with abnormal Pap tests compared with nonprogram
providers, but fortunately they were also more likely
to have access to onsite colposcopy, which facilitates
the prompt follow-up of abnormal cytology. This
likely is correlated to preferential NBCCEDP recruitment of providers with onsite colposcopy. We found
that many program providers used HPV tests for
patients with ASC-US cytology, a finding that is most
likely due to reimbursement for this indication and

HPV and Pap Testing Among CDC Program Providers/Saraiya et al.

awareness of recommendations by the CDC and
other national organizations.
Three unexpected findings call for interventions
to align practice with guidelines. First, some program
providers, including OB/GYNs, who had the highest
volume of patients with abnormal or borderline Pap
results, recommended colposcopy to patients with
ASC-US cytology and HPV-negative tests, a practice
that contrasts with FDA approvals and current guidelines.6 Conceivably, program OB-GYNs with onsite
colposcopy may advise colposcopy for all patients
with ASC-US cytology, regardless of HPV infection
status, if they are concerned that low-income or
underinsured patients may not return for repeat
cytology. If colposcopy is advised regardless of HPV
status, reflex HPV testing is unnecessary. Second,
many program providers used HPV tests for patients
with screening cytology results of higher grades than
ASC-US, a practice that is not approved by the FDA
because colposcopy is recommended regardless of
HPV status for these higher grade lesions. Third,
many program providers used HPV tests for reasons
unrelated to cervical cancer screening or abnormal
cytology management. These ‘‘off-label’’ uses may
lead to inappropriate clinical care, undue patient
anxiety, and inappropriate spending. In response, the
CDC is educating program providers regarding
appropriate HPV test use, why ‘‘off-label’’ testing
lacks clinical value and may have adverse consequences for testing, and current test reimbursement
policies.19,20
It was not surprising that only 21% of program
providers used HPV tests as an adjunct to cytology
for screening. During the survey, this test indication
had been approved by the FDA and was endorsed by
only 2 national organizations for just over a year and
was not reimbursed by the program. Therefore, the
survey did not examine how HPV test results might
influence subsequent Pap testing intervals, which is
the rationale for this indication. Future studies
should examine the influence of HPV testing on subsequent Pap testing intervals and clinical outcomes,
specifically whether HPV testing can reduce unnecessary screening among HPV-negative women with
normal Pap smears who are at very low risk of developing high-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia.
Currently, the NBCCEDP does not reimburse the
HPV test as an adjunct to cytology for women aged
30 years because such use trades off testing for
higher prevalence HPV versus lower prevalence
abnormal cytology, and the risks, benefits, and costs
of this indication remain uncertain.11,19 Because data
regarding the prevalence of HPV infection in program-eligible women with normal cytology results

1031

are lacking, questions remain concerning the number
of patients with positive HPV tests with normal cytology that such HPV testing would yield and the
impact on follow-up rates, as well as program and
patient costs. Introducing HPV testing as an adjunct
to cytology also would require educating patients
and providers about HPV epidemiology, the correlation between HPV and cervical cancer, and the benefits and shortcomings of HPV testing, as well as
appropriate educational methods for communicating
complex information to low-literacy patients. The
NBCCEDP will review its reimbursement policy after
studies of the impact of HPV testing on clinical outcomes and acceptability are completed.21–23
Strengths of the survey include its large, nationally representative sample and a high response rate,
and weighting for nonresponse, which make the analyzed subsets of providers fairly representative of all
providers in these specialties. We also surveyed midlevel providers, who provide many program services
but often are overlooked in provider surveys. However, several factors limited the survey. First, we
excluded providers who did not know whether they
participated in the program, possibly because they
were not directly involved with third-party payors or
because NBCCEDP funds were integrated into more
general women’s health programs with different
names. Second, respondents did not indicate
whether their practices differed by patient program
eligibility and this may have influenced LBC and
HPV testing practices. Differences would be minimized if providers were not aware of patient program
eligibility when ordering services or did not differentiate practices by coverage, as studies of Pap
screening intervals suggest.2 Finally, as with all surveys, reported practices may not reflect actual practices, which may be more accurately documented in
medical records or billing data.

Conclusions
The results of this survey demonstrated that
NBCCEDP providers are well poised to serve lowincome women who are at high risk for cervical cancer. These clinicians have experience with underinsured and uninsured women in rural areas, provide a
high volume of screening and management of abnormal cytology results, have good access to onsite colposcopy, use new cytology and HPV tests, and are
aware of materials and guidelines from national
organizations regarding screening and the management of abnormal cytology results. Nevertheless,
interventions with physicians and midlevel providers
are needed to address gaps in knowledge, ensure
access to new types of technology for cytology and

HPV testing when appropriate, and discourage the
use of HPV tests that are not approved by the FDA or
reimbursed by the program. Interventions such as
training, tools to support clinical decision making,
provider feedback, and enforcing HPV test reimbursement only for FDA-approved reasons should be
initiated to strengthen the program, ensure higher
quality services to its clients, and reduce inappropriate spending.
