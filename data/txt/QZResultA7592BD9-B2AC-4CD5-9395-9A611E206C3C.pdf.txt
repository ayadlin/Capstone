ABSTRACT
Hypoxia promotes neovascularization, increased tumor growth, and therapeutic
resistance. The transcription factor, hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (HIF-1α), has been
reported as the master driver of adaptation to hypoxia. We previously identified
the sphingosine kinase 1/sphingosine 1-phosphate (SphK1/S1P) pathway as a new
modulator of HIF-1α under hypoxia. Taking advantage of a monoclonal antibody
neutralizing extracellular S1P (sphingomab), we report that inhibition of S1P
extracellular signaling blocks HIF-1α accumulation and activity in several cancer cell
models exposed to hypoxia. In an orthotopic xenograft model of prostate cancer,
we show that sphingomab reduces hypoxia and modifies vessel architecture within
5 days of treatment, leading to increased intratumoral blood perfusion. Supporting
the notion that a transient vascular normalization of tumor vessels is the mechanism
by which sphingomab exerts its effects, we demonstrate that administration of the
antibody for 5 days before chemotherapy is more effective at local tumor control
and metastatic dissemination than any other treatment scheduling. These findings
validate sphingomab as a potential new normalization agent that could contribute to
successful sensitization of hypoxic tumors to chemotherapy.

isoform, which produces S1P from sphingosine [6]. Once
generated, S1P is exported by specific transporters such as
spinster 2 (Spns2) [7–9], to exert paracrine or autocrine
effects as a ligand for five high-affinity G protein-coupled
receptors (S1P1–5), with specific effects dictated by the
predominance of S1P receptor subtypes expressed [10].
Alternative GPCR-independent signaling of S1P also exist
[11] with recent findings demonstrating direct modulation
of several intracellular proteins [12, 13].
In cancer, S1P metabolism is often found to
be dysregulated directing attention to the SphK1/
S1P signaling pathway as a target for anti-cancer drug
discovery [14–16]. In a number of solid tumors, high

INTRODUCTION
Sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) is a bioactive
sphingolipid metabolite regulating pleiotropic activities
such as proliferation, survival, migration, inflammation
or angiogenesis [1–4]. The S1P content in cells is low
and is kept under control through a delicately regulated
balance between its synthesis and its degradation. The
balance between the intracellular levels of S1P and its
metabolic precursors, ceramide and sphingosine, has
been suggested to be a switch determining whether a cell
proliferates or dies [5]. The predominant regulator of this
ceramide/S1P balance is the sphingosine kinase-1 (SphK1)

SphK1 expression correlates with a significant decrease
in survival rate in patients [17–20]. The S1P produced
by SphK1 is widely appreciated as a general growthlike factor and a potent protector against apoptosis
induced by cytotoxic agents and other therapies in
various cancer cell and animal models [14]. S1P is also
thought to be as pro-angiogenic as basic fibroblast growth
factor and Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF)
in promoting the development of vascular networks
in vivo [21–24]. A number of preclinical studies have
shown that pharmacological inhibition of SphK1 could
be efficacious in decreasing tumor size or sensitize to
chemo- or radiotherapy [25–28]. Interestingly, the anticancer activity of an anti-S1P monoclonal antibody
(sphingomabTM) [29], which neutralizes S1P and inhibits
its extracellular signaling, provides evidence of the
importance of exogenous S1P in mediating tumor growth
and metastatic potential [23, 30, 31].
Hypoxia is a reduction in the normal level of
tissue oxygen tension and occurs in many pathological
conditions including cancer [32] where it contributes
to the development of an aggressive phenotype and a
poor prognostic in patients [33]. As a tumor develops,
the diffusion distance from the existing vasculature
increases resulting in hypoxia, which in turn drives the
overexpression of angiogenic factors such as VEGF,
leading to the formation of a new vasculature in an attempt
to provide adequate supply of oxygen and nutriments [34,
35]. Somewhat paradoxically, such unleashed angiogenesis
generates a highly disorganized and immature vascular
network with impaired transport characteristics resulting
in spatial and temporal inadequacies in delivery of
oxygen, thereby exacerbating tumor hypoxia and fuelling
a self-reinforcing vicious cycle [36, 37]. As a result of
the leakiness of tumor vessels, impaired blood flow and
interstitial hypertension interfere with the delivery of
therapeutics reducing their efficacy while promoting the
escape of cancer cells [37–41]. At the cellular level, the
activation of the transcription factor hypoxia-inducible
factor 1 (HIF-1) [42], has been identified as a master
regulator of the response of cancer cells to hypoxia,
triggering the expression of multiple target genes
contributing to angiogenesis, treatment failure, invasion/
metastasis, altered metabolism and genomic instability
[32, 43].
Given its central role in tumor progression
and resistance to therapy, targeting hypoxia-induced
angiogenesis represent an attractive strategy in cancer
centered on two molecular targets, HIF-1 and VEGF
[44–46]. As the direct inhibition of a transcription factor
is a challenging task [47], targeting upstream signaling
pathways leading to HIF-1 activation or downstream
effectors regulated by HIF-1 such as VEGF may
represent a more practical strategy and a wide range of
pharmacological approaches have been proposed including
the targeting of the SphK1/S1P signaling [48, 49]. Indeed,
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

we previously identified SphK1/S1P signaling as a new
canonical modulator of HIF-1 activity under hypoxic
conditions owing to a decreased proteasome degradation
of HIF-1α subunit mediated by the Akt/GSK3β pathway
in various cancer cell models [50]. Because Akt signaling
can be activated by Gi-coupling of all subtypes of S1P
receptors [10] and because S1P has been shown to be
released from hypoxic cells [51, 52], we have explored the
effects of the neutralization of extracellular S1P with antiS1P monoclonal antibody sphingomab, currently under
clinical development [15]. The goal of this study was to
demonstrate preclinical proof of concept in mice bearing
orthotopic prostate tumors that sphingomab could reduce
intratumoral hypoxia and associated vascular network
malfunction by enhancing blood perfusion to significantly
improve delivery and efficacy of docetaxel, the standard
chemotherapy for prostate cancer.

RESULTS
Extracellular S1P regulates HIF-1α level under
hypoxia in several cancer cell lineages
We previously identified SphK1 as a modulator
of HIF-1α as a key mediator of the adaptive response to
hypoxia in multiple cancer cell models [50]. These studies
led us to propose a strategy for controlling tumor hypoxia
and its biological consequences [48]. To substantiate that
inhibition of the SphK1/S1P pathway could represent a
pertinent idea, we evaluated the relevance of inhibiting
the extracellular S1P signaling with regard to HIF-1α
accumulation under hypoxia in cancer cells. We took
advantage of a monoclonal antibody (mAb), sphingomab,
that binds to and neutralizes extracellular S1P [23, 29]. As
shown in Figure 1A, sphingomab inhibited accumulation
of HIF-1α in a concentration-dependent manner in human
PC-3 prostate cancer cells. The ability of the anti-S1P
mAb to inhibit HIF-1α accumulation was tested in two
other models, including the lung adenocarcinoma cell line
A549, and the glioblastoma cell line U87. A similar dosedependent action of the anti-S1P mAb on HIF-1α content
was observed in these models (Figure 1A). S1P is mainly
produced intracellularly by SphK1 and exerts its paracrine/
autocrine effects by being secreted into the tumor
microenvironment. Spinster 2 (Spns2) has been recently
suggested to be the primary transporter in the release
of S1P [7–9, 53, 54]. When PC-3, A549 and U87 cells
were treated with Spns2-specific siRNAs, the expression
of Spns2 protein decreased to less than 10–20% of the
control with two different siRNAs tested (siSpns2a and
siSpns2b) (Figure 1B). The transient knockdown of Spns2
using these two different siRNAs was associated with a
significant inhibitory effect on HIF-1α accumulation under
hypoxia (Figure 1C). Importantly, the decrease of HIF-1α
protein content by Spns2 targeting was markedly reversed
when cells were exposed to S1P (Figure 1D). These results

analyzed by immunoblotting with an anti-HIF-1α antibody. For all experiments, similar results were obtained in at least three independent
experiments, and equal loading was monitored using antibody to α-tubulin.

agree with the data in Figure 1A and demonstrate that
extracellular S1P released from cancer cells is critical to
regulate HIF-1α accumulation under hypoxia, regardless
of the experimental conditions (10% FBS in Figure 1A
versus serum free conditions in Figure 1D).

21 days after implantation of human GFP-overexpressing
PC-3 in nude mice, the histology of the tumor was
consistent with poorly differentiated prostate cancer (data
not shown) and animals were treated every other day for
up to 9 days with 50 mg/kg sphingomab or the isotypematched IgG control by i.p. administration. Blood and
primary tumors were collected from animals sacrificed at
Day 0 or after 3, 5, 7 and 9 days of treatment with anti-S1P
or IgG control antibodies. The excised tumors were first
evaluated for immunohistochemical analysis of HIF-1α
expression. As shown in Figure 2A, anti-HIF-1α-labeled
sections showed a marked decrease in staining of tumor
cells in mice treated for 5 days with the anti-S1P mAb.
A highly significant reduction of the number of HIF-1αpositive cells in tumor sections was observed from 5 to 7
days of treatment (P < 0.0001) but returned to the control
value at 9 days suggesting a transient effect of the antiS1P mAb (Figure 2B). Western blot analysis on tumor

anti-S1P mAb we used is under clinical development,
the antibody’s ability to inhibit HIF-1α accumulation
and transcriptional activity in vivo was tested in an
orthotopic model of prostate cancer using the PC-3 cell
line, because hypoxic response is largely dependent on the

subcutaneous models [55]. As previously reported [25, 56],

lysates collected at Day 5 confirmed the marked decrease
of HIF-1α protein expression when animals were treated
with anti-S1P mAb in all samples examined (Figure 2C).
GLUT-1-stained sections revealed that inhibitory
effect of the anti-S1P mAb was not restricted to HIF1α protein accumulation but was also correlated with
an inhibition of its transcriptional activity (Figure 2D).
The treatment with anti-S1P mAb led to more than 50%
inhibition of GLUT-1 expression as early as 5 days of
treatment up to 9 days with a maximal effect seen at
Day 7 (Figure 2E). In addition, animals treated with
the anti-S1P mAb had significantly reduced levels of
circulating proangiogenic human VEGF (hVEGF)
produced by the PC-3 xenografts (Figure 2F). Collectively
these in vivo data demonstrate that S1P neutralization not
only downregulates HIF-1α content but also decreases the
expression of GLUT-1 and the secretion of VEGF, two
main factors depending on HIF-1α transcriptional activity.

As noticed for VEGF level and intratumoral hypoxia
markers, the effect of sphingomab was evident after 5 days
of treatment and maintained overtime (up to 9 days). To
examine whether the morphological vessel normalization
obtained by neutralizing S1P could translate into a
functional vasculature, blood perfusion was assessed by
a non-invasive real-time imaging using high frequency
ultrasound to allow for longitudinal study on the same
animal [57, 58]. At different times after administration of
anti-S1P mAb or control IgG, the slope and magnitude
of microbubble contrast agent influx was measured to
quantify the blood flow in vessels (Figure 4C and 4D). In
anti-S1P mAb-treated mice, tumor perfusion significantly
augmented as early as 5 days of administration, peaked
at Day 7 (over 3-fold increase), then returned to basal
level by Day 13 (Figure 4C and 4D). Collectively, these
results showing the reduction in tumor hypoxia and
enhanced vascular flow when S1P is neutralized support
the notion that a transient “vascular normalization” [41] is
the mechanism by which anti-S1P mAb exerts its effects,
an effect which could enhance the efficacy of cytotoxic
agents (see below).

Neutralization of S1P is associated with
decreased intratumoral hypoxia, vascular
remodelling and increased blood flow

Anti-S1P mAb’s direct effects on tumor cell
proliferation and apoptosis

We previously observed that neutralization of S1P
was associated with a reduction in the release of the
potent vascular permeability factor VEGF from tumors,
validating the sphingomab as an antiangiogenic agent
[23]. We therefore analyzed effects of the antibody
on the vasculature of orthotopic PC-3 tumor using
immunohistochemical expression of CD34 as biological
marker of angiogenesis. In agreement with the in vivo
effect formerly reported in a subcutaneous A549 model
[23], immunohistochemical analysis indicated a marked
decrease in microvessel density in mice treated with the
anti-S1P mAb throughout all the experiment time course
(Figure 3A and 3B). The remaining vessels seemed to be
opened indicating that “immature” vessels were likely
preferentially eliminated (Figure 3A). The treatment with
the anti-S1P mAb was accompanied by a marked reduction
of intratumoral hypoxia as measured by pimonidazole
staining, an effect that was significant as early as 5 days
of treatment with a persisting effect that peaked at Day 7
(Figure 3C and 3D).
We next determined how hypoxia and neoan­
giogenesis were antagonized by the anti-S1P mAb. We
first evaluated the architecture and the functional status
of tumor vasculature. Because perivascular pericytes play
a critical role in vessel maturation and stabilization [37],
a double staining for pericytes (α-smooth muscle actin
or α-SMA) and endothelial cells (CD34) was performed
to quantify the extent of pericyte coverage. A significant
increase of the number of α-SMA-positive intratumoral
blood vessels was found in tumor-bearing animals treated
with anti-S1P mAb, demonstrating the characteristic
development of more mature vessels (Figure 4A and 4B).

www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

S1P is a well-established proliferative and antiapoptotic mediator [5, 59], the ability of anti-S1P antibody
to alter cell proliferation and death of PC-3 xenograft was
also evaluated. The Ki67 proliferation marker was used
to estimate the fraction of viable cells undergoing active
proliferation within the tumor. Anti-S1P mAb-treated
tumors exhibited a notable decrease in cell proliferation
rate that was evident after 5 days of administration
(Figure 5A and 5B). Tumor cell death was assessed by
the activation of the apoptotic executioner caspase-3.
In agreement with previous reports showing that S1P
inhibits activation of caspase-3 [23, 60], the treatment
with anti-S1P mAb was associated with increased
apoptosis as reflected by the increased level of cleaved
caspase-3 (Figure 5C and 5D). These data suggest that the
proliferative and protective antiapoptotic effects of S1P
are mitigated when extracellular S1P is neutralized by the
anti-S1P antibody.

Anti-S1P mAb-induced vascular normalization
sensitizes to chemotherapy in established
orthotopic PC-3/GFP tumors in mice
Hypoxia plays a central role in tumor resistance to
therapy including chemotherapy [45] and preclinical and
clinical data support and offer a rationale of why a therapy
aimed at increasing blood flow should result in improved
drug delivery [39, 40]. We hypothesized that the vascular
normalization period we observed with the anti-S1P

mAb (optimal time of 5 to 9 days) offers an opportunity
for enhanced response to docetaxel, the standard of care
for the treatment of metastatic prostate cancer [61, 62].
To this end, we relied on an orthotopic model of PC-3
cells overexpressing GFP, growing in their native milieu
and leading to a local regional growth and spontaneous
distant metastasis dissemination within five weeks that
could be monitored by fluorescence imaging [56]. The
therapeutic relevance of anti-S1P mAb-induced increase in
transient vascular normalization (or oxygenation window)
to docetaxel was investigated by varying the sequence of
anti-S1P administration and chemotherapy (Figure 6A).
In the first therapeutic approach, tumor-bearing
mice were treated with anti-S1P mAb (50 mg/kg every
other day) for a 5-day oxygenation window prior to 5 mg/
kg docetaxel (Arm 2) or with a classical combination of
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

anti-S1P mAb and docetaxel administered at the same time
(Arm 3). Significantly smaller tumors (mean = 455 mm3)
were seen in animals treated with 5 mg/kg docetaxel alone
(Arm 5) (Figure 6B and 6C). Interestingly, administration
of anti-S1P mAb alone (Arm 4) was not accompanied
with a statistical reduction of primary tumor volume
(mean = 724 mm3) as compared to IgG-treated control
animal (Arm 1, mean = 1010 mm3) and the combination
of S1P mAb with docetaxel administered at the same
time (Arm 3, mean = 373 mm3) did not significantly
sensitize to docetaxel alone (Arm 5) (Figure 6B and
6C). Clearly, the greater effect on primary tumor growth
occurred when anti-S1P mAb was administered 5 days
before docetaxel treatment (Arm 2, mean = 144 mm3).
Supporting the notion that chemotherapy response could
be optimum when docetaxel is given when after vascular

normalization is achieved by anti-S1P mAb treatment,
we demonstrated in Figure 6 that a significant difference
(P = 0.0156) was observed between Arm 2 (anti-S1P mAb
prior to docetaxel) and Arm 3 (anti-S1P mAb coincident
with docetaxel) (Figure 6B and 6C). In addition to
demonstrating an effect of antibody treatment on tumor
volume, our fluorescent model allowed us to monitor
metastatic dissemination in order to determine effects
of the anti-S1P mAb on metastatic potential (Table 1).
Although no treatment was able to significantly prevent
lymph node tumor involvement (Table 1), we found a
marked decreased in the volume of periaortic lymph
nodes when anti-S1P mAb was combined to docetaxel
(Figure 6D and 6E). As shown in Table 1, the anti-S1P
mAb administration given before chemotherapy markedly
reduced the total number of metastases (average per
animal: 3.8) by comparison with isotype antibody controltreated Arm 1 (average per animal: 7.8). The effect of on
primary tumor growth was thus consequently paralleled
by a significant limitation of metastasis dissemination
when anti-S1P mAb was given for 5 days before initiating
chemotherapy.

To rule out that improved therapeutic outcome
caused by the sequential dosing (Arm 2) was not a mere
reflection of the longer administration of anti-S1P mAb
when compared to the classical combination treatment
without pre-treatment (Arm 3), a second therapeutic
approach was conducted with additional scheduling
conditions (Supplementary Figure 1A). Treatments were
initiated at Day 21 rather than Day 26 and compared to the
sequential normalization treatment (Arm 2). Surprisingly,
starting docetaxel treatment earlier did not improve the
efficacy with regard to tumor growth (Arm 6 versus Arm 5)
(Supplementary Figure 1B). When docetaxel was given
as early as 21 days post-implantation in combination with
anti-S1P mAb (Arm 8), there was no significant difference
in terms of therapeutic efficacy compared to the 26-day
conditions (Arm 3), implying that an extra 5-day duration
of treatment did not matter (Supplementary Figure 1B).
Importantly, the sequential scheduling (Arm 2) was always
superior to all the others (Arm 3 or Arm 8) in terms of
therapeutic efficacy (Supplementary Figure 1B).
In sum, these data suggest mechanistically that the
anti-S1P mAb treatment leads to improved chemotherapy

characterized by improved connection between adjacent
endothelial cells, increased ratio of pericyte-covered
vessels, improved association between endothelial cells
and pericytes, and reduced hypoxia [41]. Importantly, the
accompanying period of enhanced oxygenation known
as the “normalization window”, ranging in general from
few days in mice models [41] to several weeks in some
patients [81], corresponds to a period of enhanced chemo
or radiosensitivity in treated tumors [40, 41, 75, 80].
Lastly, the most compelling support for the benefit of
vascular normalization is its benefit on progression-free
and overall survival rates in patients [81–84].
We recently identified the SphK1/S1P signaling as
a new modulator of HIF-1α accumulation and increased
activity under hypoxia, through activation of the Akt/
GSK3β pathway [50, 85]. It was recently reported that
direct addition of S1P to thyroid cancer cells stimulate Akt
signaling under normoxic conditions [86]. Because Akt
is activated by Gi-coupling of all subtypes of GPCR S1P
receptors [10], and because S1P is secreted by hypoxic cells
[51, 52], we analyzed the effects of the neutralization of
extracellular S1P with the anti-S1P mAb, sphingomab [15].
Here we report for the first time that sphingomab inhibits
HIF-1α accumulation and activity under hypoxia in various
cell models (prostate, lung, glioma). This was a consequence
of the secretion of S1P by hypoxic cells since knock-down
of the S1P transporter Spns2 blocked the activation of HIF1α, an effect that was reversed by the addition of S1P.
In an orthotopic prostate cancer animal model,
we characterized the time course of morphological and
functional changes in the vasculature of the tumor as well
as intratumoral hypoxia in response to treatment with
sphingomab. We demonstrated that S1P neutralization
created a less hypoxic environment as shown by the marked
decreased in HIF-1α expression and activity (concomitant
decrease in GLUT-1 expression), and secretion of VEGF
from the tumor. As a result, vascular remodelling occurred
as demonstrated by decreased microvessel density and
vessel morphological changes namely increased coverage of
pericytes. As previously reported for anti-VEGF strategies in
other preclinical models [75–77], the anti-S1P mAb was able
to normalize intratumoral vasculature after a period (from
5 to 9 days) of treatment. Measurements of tumor blood flow
and perfusion assessed by high resolution 3-dimensional
power Doppler ultrasound [57, 58] demonstrated a
transient improvement in tumor perfusion. Finally and
most importantly, we established that the transient vascular
normalization window induced by sphingomab created an
optimal time frame for the administration of docetaxelbased chemotherapy with enhanced efficacy. Indeed, the
therapeutic relevance of sphingomab-induced increases in
tumor oxygenation to chemotherapy was investigated by
varying the schedules of sphingomab and chemotherapy.
Clearly, a greater benefit on both primary tumor and
metastasis dissemination took place when sphingomab was
administered 5 days prior docetaxel treatment.

response when administered for a short period of
time before the commencement of chemotherapy, as a
consequence of antibody-induced vascular normalization.
In addition to efficacy studies described above, we
conducted a toxicology study at the end of the experiment
described in Figure 6 designed to evaluate how well the
antibody was tolerated in mice. All biochemical and
complete blood count (CBC) and serum chemistry markers
were within normal range (Supplementary Figures 2 and 3).
A statistically significant leukopenia was noted only
in mice treated with the combination of anti-S1P mAb
and docetaxel, which was mainly the consequence of a
significant reduction in total circulating lymphocytes as
reported previously [23, 29, 63].

DISCUSSION
Hypoxia is a hallmark of solid tumors driving
the production of angiogenic factors to establish a
new vascular network [35, 37]. In contrast to healthy
tissues, hypoxia-triggered overexpression of VEGF
and other pro-angiogenic factors in tumors leads to a
structurally and functionally abnormal vasculature, which
further aggravates hypoxia setting up a vicious cycle
promoting tumorigenesis and metastatic potential [36,
37]. Anatomically, tumor vessels are dilated, tortuous,
and saccular with chaotic patterns of interconnection
and branching [64]. Unlike a normal vasculature where
stable endothelial cells are connected by adherens
junctions including vascular endothelial (VE)-cadherin
[65], VEGF causes VE-cadherin destabilization hence a
loosening of endothelial cell association [66]. Moreover,
pericytes, normally positioned around and interacting
with endothelial cells to prevent vessel leakage are
absent or loosely attached [67, 68]. The mechanisms for
abnormal pericyte behavior in tumors are manifold, but
include VEGF as a negative regulator [69, 70]. Taken as
a whole, the structural weaknesses of tumor vessels, by
contributing to a porousness vasculature phenotype, have
adverse consequences notably dissemination of tumor
cells [71, 72] and impaired drug delivery and efficacy [39,
40]. For these reasons, strategies aimed at restoring tumor
vasculature to a more normal state are a matter of the
utmost importance as the improvement of vessel structure
and function may delay progression and improve delivery
and efficacy of chemotherapeutics [41]. Because VEGF
is primarily accountable for this haphazard vasculature,
it was hypothesized by Rakesh Jain that mopping up
excess of VEGF, rather than destroying vessels, would
prune away some abnormal vessels and remodel the
remaining ones resulting in a more mature vasculature [73,
74]. Over the years, a wide array of preclinical [75–77]
and clinical [78–81] studies have provided evidence to
support this postulate, showing that judicious treatment
with anti-VEGF agents results in transient enhancement
of vascular function termed “vascular normalization”

Interestingly S1P has originally been shown to
stabilize blood vessels in development and homeostasis
through S1P receptor subtype 1 (S1P1) by promoting the
formation of VE-cadherin-containing adherens junctions
in endothelial cells [21, 87, 88]. Supporting this notion,
the loss S1P1 in retinal endothelial cells results in vessels
displaying poor blood flow and vascular leakage [89].
In addition, vessel coverage by pericytes is also directed
by the activity of S1P1 receptor in endothelial cells [90,
91] by trafficking and activating N-cadherin involved in
endothelial cell/pericyte interactions [92]. Our findings that
neutralization of exogenous S1P with sphingomab leads
to vascular maturation in hypoxic tumors are somehow
counterintuitive to the undisputed role of S1P1, one of its
main cognate receptor. Surprisingly it has been reported
that S1P could increase vascular permeability similar to
VEGF, the canonical vascular permeability factor [93]. The
mechanism of action would involve the activation of the
S1P2 subtype S1P receptor. This observation was extended
to in vivo model of vascular permeability in the rat lung, in
which the S1P2 antagonist JTE013 significantly inhibited
H2O2-induced permeability [93]. In vitro and in vivo
models of inflammation-induced vascular permeability
confirmed the role of S1P2 [94]. These studies indicate
that the relative expression of S1P1 and S1P2 receptors
in a specific vascular bed would determine the response
to S1P. Noteworthy, in vivo studies have shown that S1P2
expression is markedly enhanced under hypoxic stress in
pathological angiogenesis of the mouse retina, establishing
its essential role in pathological neovascularization [95].
Further supporting a critical role for S1P2 signaling in
mediating vascular permeability, the addition of exogenous
S1P to normoxic endothelial cells also induce the
activation of HIF-1α and subsequent rise in VEGF release,
suggesting a potential amplification of VEGF signaling
[96]. Lastly, S1P2-deficient (S1p2-/-) mice implanted with
lung or melanoma cells displayed increased number of
maturated and functional tumor vessels, showing increased
pericyte coverage [97]. In summary, one might speculate
that the balance between S1P1 and S1P2 receptors in the
endothelium could be modified by hypoxia, with a shift
toward higher S1P2 expression hence increasing vascular
permeability. Neutralization of S1P produced by hypoxic
tumor cells by sphingomab could have a direct impact on
vessels by switching off S1P2-mediated vascular leakage,
a mechanism reminiscent of the effect of bevacizumab on
VEGF. In addition, neutralization of S1P through inhibition
of HIF-1α could impact the cancer cell compartment
by reducing intratumoral hypoxia and its undesirable
consequences (including VEGF overproduction), while
sensitizing tumor cells to cytotoxic agents as S1P is a wellestablish anti-apoptotic agent [5].
The extent of intratumoral hypoxia seen in the
prostate cancer context is comparable to that seen in
other cancers [98]. Since the seminal study conducted by
Folkman’s group showing that angiogenesis correlates
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

with metastasis in invasive prostate cancer [99], numerous
reports have confirmed an association between prostate
cancer aggressiveness and increased microvessel density,
greater irregularity of the vessel lumen and smaller vessels
[100]. In a prostatectomy cohort of patients (n = 572) with
clinically localized prostate cancer with 20 years of followup, men with the most irregularly shaped vessels were 17.1
times more likely to develop lethal disease several years
after diagnosis [101]. These data clearly suggest that the
morphologic characteristics that reflect the pattern and
maturity of the growing vascular network could represent
valid indicators of neoangiogenesis, cancer aggressiveness,
and metastatic potential in prostate. In patients with
metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer, VEGF levels
are independent predictors of overall survival [102]. These
data supported the hypothesis that VEGF inhibition may
enhance current therapies in metastatic prostate cancer.
However, the failure of two recently published phase III
trials [103, 104] based on combination regimens associating
docetaxel with anti-VEGF strategies (bevacizumab or
aflibercept) underline our limited understanding of the
therapeutic targets being explored and poor preclinical
investigation. No preclinical data to lend support to the
combination of docetaxel and anti-VEGF approaches have
been reported in the literature, and the vast majority of
phase II trials have used non-randomized designs [105].
Despite the fact that these large trials have produced
disappointing results with docetaxel-based combined antiVEGF therapies, the notion that reduction of hypoxia and
improvement of functional vascularization could sensitize
to a therapeutic regimen has been successfully suggested
in prostate cancer. Evidence exists that diminution of
intratumoral hypoxia [106, 107], reduction of VEGF
production [108] and improved functional vascularization
[109] during androgen deprivation (ADT) would be
accountable for the improved clinical outcome and patient
survival observed in phase III clinical trials of short-term
neoadjuvant ADT before radiotherapy [110, 111].
In view of these data supporting that only a
neoadjuvant approach (ADT) could successfully sensitize
to a therapy in prostate cancer, our preclinical findings
may have clinical implications. Improvement in blood
perfusion leading to better drug delivery or increased
tumor oxygenation offers a rationale as to why S1P
neutralization might perhaps be started prior to cytotoxic
therapy (chemo- or radiotherapy) and continued through
this therapy. Non-invasive imaging techniques are
currently available in the clinic that could be used to assess
tumor vascularity (i.e. DCE MRI) and/or oxygenation such
as PET scanning with hypoxia sensitive tracers [79, 81, 82,
84, 109]. Hence, our findings encourage further clinical
studies to assess whether optimized scheduling of antiS1P treatment provide evidence for vessel normalization
in cancer patients to identify those who might be benefit
from a combination therapy with cytotoxic agents or
radiotherapy.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Animals

Chemicals, reagents and kits

Male NMRI/Nu (nu/nu) 6-wk-old mice were
obtained from Elevage Janvier (Le Genest Saint Isle,
France). Mice were housed in a barrier facility of highefficiency particulate air-filtered racks. At 7–8 wk of age,
the animals were used in accordance with the principles
and procedures outlined in Council Directive 86/809/
EEC. The Institut Fédératif de Recherche Bio-médicale
de Toulouse Animal Care and Use Committee approved
all animal studies.

Culture medium and serum were from Invitrogen
(Villebon sur Yvette, France). The murine monoclonal
anti-S1P antibody, Sphingomab, and its isotype-matched
mAb control, LT1017, were generated as described
previously [29]. S1P was from Avanti Polar Lipids
(Alabaster, AL). Docetaxel was purchased from SigmaAldrich (St. Louis, MO). hVEGF plasma levels were
quantified using a human VEGF Quantikine ELISA kit
(RαD systems, Lille, France) according to manufacturer’s
instructions, respectively.

Blood and plasma samples
Blood samples were analysed using the ABX Micros
60 Hematology Analyzer and analytical parameters were
determined in plasma by routine laboratory methods using
an autoanalyzer (Cobas Mira+), Plateforme phenotypage
ANEXPLO (Toulouse, France).

Cell lines
Human prostate cancer PC-3 and lung carcinoma
A549 cell lines were obtained from DSMZ (Braunschweig,
Germany). Human U87 glioblastoma cells were from
ATCC-LGC Standards (Molsheim, France). Cells were
cultured in RPMI 1640 containing 10% fetal bovine
serum at 37°C in 5% CO2 humidified incubators. Cell
lines were routinely verified by the following tests:
morphology microscopic examination, growth curve
analysis and mycoplasma detection (MycoAlertTM, Lonza,
Basel, Switzerland). All experiments were started with
low-passaged cells (<15 times). Hypoxia (0.1% O2, 5%
CO2, 94.5% N2) was achieved using an In Vivo2 hypoxic
workstation (Ruskinn Technologies, Bridgend, UK).

Immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence
Staining was conducted on paraformaldehyde
(PFA)-fixed and paraffin-embedded tissue using 5 μm
sections. Intratumoral hypoxia was assessed using a
commercially available HypoxyprobeTM-1 kit for the
detection of tissue hypoxia (Hypoxyprobe Inc., Burlington,
MA). Pimonidazole hydrochloride was given at a dose
of 60 mg/kg in 0.9% saline via intraperitoneal injection
one hour before euthanasia, and orthotopic tumors
were harvested and fixed in 4% PFA. Details regarding
antibodies, dilutions, and antigen-retrieval methods used
are provided in Supplementary Table S1.

siRNA-mediated knockdown of Spns2
Cancer cells were transfected with 90nM of each
specific MISSION predesigned small interfering RNA
(siRNA, Sigma-Aldrich) using Lipofectamine 2000
reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. Aleatory sequence scrambled siRNA was
from Eurogentec (Angers, France). Details of each specific
MISSION predesigned siRNAs are provided below:
human Spns2 siRNAa: 5′-CGCUCAUGCUCUGCCCU
UUdTdT-3′; and human Spns2 siRNAb: 5′-CACUCAUC
CUCAUUCUGGUdTdT-3′.

Orthotopic implantation of PC-3/GFP prostate
cancer cells, and in vivo fluorescence imaging
Intraprostatic human prostate cancer xenografts
were established in nude mice by surgical orthotopic
implantation. Mice were anesthetized by isoflurane
inhalation and placed in the supine position. A lower
midline abdominal incision was made, and a 20 μL
tumor cell suspension (1 x 106 cells) was injected into the
dorsal lobe of the prostate using a 30-gauge needle and
glass syringe. The surgical wound was closed in 2 layers
with 4–0 Dexon interrupted sutures. All procedures were
performed with a dissecting microscope. Autopsy and in
vivo fluorescence imaging were conducted as previously
detailed [56].

Western-blot analysis and antibodies
Mouse HIF-1α (BD Biosciences, Le Pont de Claix,
France), rabbit anti-Spns2 (Sigma-Aldrich) were used as
primary antibodies. Western blot assays were conducted
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Proteins were
visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence detection system
(Pierce, Brebières, France) using antirabbit or antimouse
horseradish peroxidase–conjugated IgG (Bio-Rad, Hercules,
CA). Equal loading was confirmed by probing the blots with
the mouse anti-tubulin antibody (Sigma-Aldrich, clone
DM1A). Densitometry quantitation was determined using
Image J software (NIH, Bethesda, MD).

Student’s t test. The frequencies of metastases between
two groups were compared using Fisher’s exact test.
Differences in the number of metastases per mouse
were examined using a nonparametric Wilcoxon - Mann
Whitney test. All statistical tests were two-sided and the
level of significance was set at P < 0.05. Calcula­tions were
done using Instat (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA).

This was operated with a Vevo 2100 linear array based
high-frequency ultrasound imaging system (VisualSonics,
Amsterdam, The Netherlands) and subsequent release of
Nonlinear Contrast Imaging Mode. This allowed to assess
the tumoral responses to anti-angiogenic drugs, even
in absence of change in tumor size. The Micromarker
Contrast Agent was delivered as a bolus injection
intravenously (tail), and a time versus intensity curve is
generated. The perfusion curve kinetics is an exponential
limited by a maximum. The initial slope is proportional to
the flow velocity and the maximum value of the plateau
is proportional to the vascular fractional volume. The
product of these two values gives a measure of the true
perfusion. The perfusion model is defined as:
