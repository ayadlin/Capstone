ABSTRACT
A 71-year-old man was diagnosed with T-Large granular lymphocytic
(LGL) leukemia, which usually represents a relatively indolent clinical
course. While the clinical manifestation of this patient we report herein
was aggressive with lasting fever, splenomegaly and hemophagocytic
lymphohistiocytosis (HLH). T-cell immunophenotype was CD3+CD4-CD8-CD5CD7-TCRαβ+. After comprehensive evaluation, an adjusted chemotherapy
regimen CEOP (cyclophosphamide, vincristine, etoposide, prednisone) with
etoposide, a potential effective regimen for HLH was administrated to the
patient. Although he received intensive regimen, the patient showed drug
resistance and disease progression with central nervous system (CNS)
involvement during treatment and showed only transiently response to
intrathecal methotrexate, cytarabine and dexamethasone. Therefore,
considering the refractory elderly patient with fragile physical condition,
metronomic regimen T-PEPC (oral administration of thalidomide, prednisone,
cyclophosphamide, etoposide and methylhydrazine) was recommended,
which refers to the frequent even daily administration of cytotoxic drugs at
comparatively low doses with minimal or prolonged drug-free breaks. The
patient responded well to this treatment and remained symptom-free for
8-month follow-up. To our knowledge, this is the first case of reporting this
unique immunophenotype of dual CD4-/CD8- with aggressive clinical course
and CNS involvement that successfully treated with metronomic regimen,
suggesting that low dose metronomic regimen could be a better option for
elderly patient with aggressive T-LGL leukemia.

INTRODUCTION

killer LGL (NK-LGL) leukemia subtypes [2]. The typical
phenotype of T-LGL leukemia is CD3+/TCR-αβ+/CD4-/
CD8+/CD57+/ CD16+ [3]. Usually, T-LGL leukemia is
a clinically indolent disease and it represents the most
common LGL disorder in western countries, according
to 85% of all cases [4, 5]. Herein, we describe a unique
case of 71-year-old male patient with aggressive T-LGL
leukemia, who failed to respond and progressed with CNS
involvement during induction chemotherapy and achieved
durable disease control with metronomic regimen.

Large granular lymphocytic(LGL) leukemia is
a rare T or NK clonal lymphoproliferative disorder,
whose clinical presentation is dominated by a variety of
autoimmune disorders including pure red cell aplasia,
Sjogrens Syndrome and rheumatoid arthritis (RA) [1].
According to the world health organization (WHO)
classification, LGL leukemia can be divided into CD3
(+) T-cell LGL (T-LGL) leukemia and CD3 (-) natural

CASE REPORT

a recurrence of systemic symptoms and intermittent
dizziness two weeks after discharge, then he readmitted
to our hospital. CT scan of brain indicated no spaceoccupying lesions , but cerebrospinal fluid test showed that
cell count was 540 /μl, Pandy test was positive, protein in
cerebrospinal fluid was 0.95g/L, hypercellular fluid was
infiltrated with mononuclear cells which presented with
abundant cytoplasm and azurophilic granules (Figure
3), with its immunophenotype in accordance with bone
marrow, the diagnosis of T-LGL leukemia with CNS
involvement was confirmed. The patient relieved of
dizziness after intrathecal injection of methotrexate,
cytarabine and dexamethasone was administrated but
recurrence of dizziness occurred only three days later.
Given that the disease progressed with CNS involvement
during chemotherapy and the patient with fragile physical
condition, intensive intravenous chemotherapy was
not appropriate. Into this embarrassing situation, oral
metronomic regimen T-PEPC (oral administration of
prednisone 40mg, cyclophosphamide 50mg, etoposide
50mg, methyhydrazine 50mg, thalidomide 100mg every
day) targeted both malignant cells and microenvironment
was considered to control progressive disease with low
toxicities. About one month after receiving T-PEPC
regimen, body temperature of the patient returned to
normal range and a significant improvement in abdominal
pain was achieved. The latest follow-up CBC test revealed
WBC: 3.5×109/L, lymphocyte%: 38%, Hb: 109g/L, PLT:
290×109/L without CNS symptoms and normal size
of spleen, and the patient remained symptom-free at
8-month follow-up. This study was approved by the ethics
committee of the the First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing
Medical University.

A 71-year-old man who presented with persistent
left-sided abdominal pain and hyperpyrexia for two months
was admitted into local hospital. Complete blood cell
(CBC) revealed white blood cell (WBC) count 12×109/L,
lymphocyte%: 78.34%, hemoglobin (Hb) 107g/L and
platelets 100×109/L, lactate dehydrogenase(LDH) level
was 627 U/L, virologic profile demonstrated HbsAg(-),
HbsAb(+), HBeAb (+), HBcAb (+) and EBV DNA <
5000/ml. A contrast-enhanced computed tomography
(CT) scan of the chest and abdomen showed obvious
splenomegaly without lymphadenopathy. Bone marrow
aspirate reflected increasing mature lymphocytes
suggesting lymph proliferative disorders. During local
admission, the patient received symptomatic treatment
including antibiotics and glucocorticoid, but no response
was observed. The patient subsequently was transferred
to our hospital for further diagnosis and treatment.
Physical examination showed massive splenomegaly
without general enlargement of the lymph nodes, ECOG
was 4 points. The CBC revealed WBC: 16.61×109/L,
neutrophil: 0.93×109/L, Hb: 70g/L, PLT: 55×109/L,
ferritin level was 608.70ng/mL and soluble CD25 was
7245 IU/ml. Bone marrow aspirate and biopsy showed
lymphocytosis of LGL cells which represented medium to
large cells with eccentric nuclei and abundant cytoplasm
containing course azurophilic granules, accounting for
23% (Figure 1). Immunohistochemistry analysis of bone
marrow showed malignant cells that were CD3 (+), CD56
(-), TIA1 (+), granzyme B (-). Flow cytometry illustrated
abnormal T-cell immunophenotype was CD3+CD4CD8- CD5-CD7-, TCRαβ+ and further 24 subtypes of
the variable region families of β chain was less than 30%
which is an indirect proof of T cell clonality abnormality.
TCR gene rearrangement by PCR was positive for
TCR β and γ (Figure 2), STAT3 mutation identified
by Sanger sequencing was negative. Chromosomal
alterations detected by conventional cytogenetics showed
49, XY, +5, +13, +14, -16, der (16), +22 [4cp]/46, XY
[6]. And the patient, therefore, with typical cellular
morphology, monoclonal immunophenotype and TCR
gene rearrangement, a diagnosis of T-LGL leukemia
was established. Besides T-LGL leukemia, the patient,
with prolonged fever, pancytopenia, splenomegaly,
hyperferritinemia and increasing level of sCD25 which
also reached diagnostic criterion of HLH-2004 protocol
of hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis. Considering
the patient ,with awful physical condition, pursued an
aggressive clinical course with HLH, intensive regimen
CEOP (cyclophosphamide with a dose of 750mg/m2
d1, vincristine 2mg d1, etoposide 100mg/m2 d1-d3,
prednisone 60mg/m2×d for five days) instead of oral MTX
plus prednisone was recommended. After two cycles of
chemotherapy, the patient was discharged from the
hospital without fever and abdominal pain. But he showed

DISCUSSION

feature, unique immunophenotyping by flow cytometry
and T cell clonality demonstrated by TCR rearrangement
plus clinical presentation, could make a definite diagnosis
of T-LGL leukemia.
Recently, Hanna L.M. et. al [14] reported mutations
in the signal transducer and activator of transcription 3
gene (STAT3) were found in 31 of 77 patients (40%) with
LGL leukemia, recurrent mutational hot spots included
Y640F, D661V, D661Y,N647. Among them, the most
frequent mutation hot spots were Y640F and D661V.
Besides, STAT3 mutation was also found in CLPD-NK
cohorts. Comparison of clinical characteristics of these
patients showed that neutropenia and rheumatoid arthritis
were more common among patients with a STAT3
mutation. Besides, patients with STAT3 mutations also
tended to need more treatments like corticosteroids,
cyclosporine, cyclophosphamide or red blood cell
transfusion [15], suggesting that aberrant STAT3
signaling underlies the pathogenesis of this disease.
Thus STAT3 can be served as an auxiliary diagnosis tool
of classifying LGL leukemia as true T-cell leukemia or
hyperreactive or persistent T-cell response. STAT3 was
only found in the T-cell (CD8+) fraction, and expression
analysis demonstrated that patients with or without STAT3
mutations had many common overexpressed STAT3 genes
[16]. STAT3 mutation status of this patient is negative,
which may be related to atypical immunophenotyiping of
CD3+CD4-CD8-.
To our knowledge, this is the first case that
reported a patient of T-LGL leukemia with phenotype of
TCRαβ﹢CD3+CD4-CD8- presented with an aggressive
clinical course and CNS involvement during intensive
treatment. A vast majority of patients (80%-90%) with
T-LGL leukemia showed a CD3+ CD4-CD8+ CD57+
CD56- CD28-,TCRαβphenotype [17], while CD4- CD8usually accompanied with TCR γδ, but had a favorable
survival of 85% at 3 years [18]. To our knowledge,

Granular lymphocytes are normally accounted for
10%-15% of peripheral blood mononuclear cells with
abundant cytoplasms and azurophilic granules [6]. The
diagnosis of LGL leukemia is based on chronic LGL
peripheral blood expansion ( > 2×109/L), usually lasting
for more than 6 months with typical morphological
characteristics. Semenzato et al [7] studied 11 patients
with chronic granular lymphocytosis that did not meet the
criteria for LGL leukemia, namely, all patients had a LGL
peripheral blood expansion less than 2×109/L, however, the
clinical and laboratory features of these patients are similar
to those patients with LGL cells greater than 2×109/L.
Besides, immunphenotype, TCR gene rearrangement
and follow-up clinical course of these patients all meet
the diagnosis of LGL leukemia. Thus, current diagnosis
of LGL leukemia could be refined as 1) chronic LGL
peripheral blood expansion (mostly 2-20×109/L), usually
lasting for more than 6 months , while 25%-30% patients
with circulating LGL cells less than 0.5×109/L need
assistant diagnosis with immunophenotype and TCR
gene rearrangement. 2) Classical immunophenotype
mostly CD3+CD8+CD57+TCRαβCD3+CD4+CD8-CD57+
TCRαβ+, CD3+CD4-CD8-CD57+TCRγδ+. 3) T-cell
clonality demonstrated by rearrangement of TCRγ gene
using PCR or vβ-expression via flow cytometry [7-8]. 4)
Clinical presentation like cytopenia, splenomegaly and
rheumatoid arthritis etc. More importantly, diseases like
HIV infections, post-splenectomy, allogeneic bone marrow
transplantation, or solid organ transplantation could
present with benign LGL cells proliferations with similar
morphology [9-12]. After the widespread availability of
TCR and flow cytometry, it became much accurate to
distinguish the LGL leukemia as a neoplastic disease or
reactive lymphocytosis [13]. According to current criteria,
the patient we reported, with typical morphological

T-LGL leukemia is a rare lymphoproliferative disorder
of mature cytotoxic CD3+ lymphocytes with a clinical
indolent course and a median survival of 10 years [8, 19,
20]. Aggressive clinical course usually exists in NK-LGL
leukemia, another type of LGL leukemia, while NK cells
do not express CD3 or TCR, whose TCR genes are not
rearranged [21]. Of course, T-LGL leukemia can present
with a severe systemic illness that is rapidly progressive
and resistant to treatment but with a phenotype of CD3+
and CD56+, which is separate from the usual CD3+,
CD56- T-LGL leukemia [22] Aggressive T-cell LGL
leukemia is supposed to arise from clonal evolution of
indolent T-cell LGL leukemia but it is more like a de novo
development [23, 24].The patient in our case is also the
typical CD3+CD56-, with a unique phenotype variants
of dual CD4-/CD8-,while it commonly accompanied
with γδ+ T-cells [25]. Therefore, whether TCRɑβ with
phenotype variants of dual CD4-/CD8- could lead to an
aggressive clinical course and resistant to intravenous
chemotherapy warrants further investigation, besides, we
should exclude other aggressive LGL leukemia, that’s why
we studied STAT5b status in this patient, and the result is
negative . As we know, STAT5b is a vital regulator in the
proliferation, differentiation and survival of tumor cell and
other aggressive lymphoid maligancies harboured STAT5b
mutations. The result ,which to some extent, made our
case more complicated.
The clinical presentation of indolent T-LGL
leukemia embodies about one third as asymptomatic
and two thirds symptomatic with neutropenia resulting
in an increased frequency of bacterial infection, anemia,
thrombocytopenia, splenomegaly and autoimmune
conditions like rheumatoid arthritis, pure red cell
aplasia, immune thrombocytopenia purpura, and the
prognosis of these individuals is usually favorable with
immunosuppressive regimen [26]. Aggressive T-LGL
leukemia is relatively rare with clinical features including
cytopenia, acute B symptoms such as fever, night sweats,
weight loss and hepatosplenomegaly [27, 28] . The patient
we reported herein pursued an aggressive clinical course
with high fever, splenomegaly, and increasing process
with CNS involvement during intravenous chemotherapy
but without any indications of autoimmune conditions.
Since the etiology of T-LGL leukemia is not clear
and no prospective clinical trials have been reported, thus,
treatment recommendations are based on case reports
and retrospective studies [6]. Most patients are treated
with low dose immunosuppressive therapy regarding the
indolent clinical course, which include single agents like
methotrexate, oral cyclophosphamide or cyclosporine
and often combine with prednisone, and the treatment
only started in those patients with severe neutropenia,
anemia or rheumatoid arthritis (RA) [8]. Since prednisone
can temporarily improve neutropenia, MTX has been
an effective treatment for RA and cyclophosphamide
has been preferentially used in LGL leukemia patients
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

with pure red cell aplasia [29, 30]. Besides, such
immunosuppressive agents, like purine analogue (e.g.
fludarabine in combination with dexamethasone) have had
impressive response rate and Alemtuzumab (Campath),
as a monoclonal antibody against CD52 is served as an
effective therapy for LGL leukemia mostly with PRCA
[31]. Furthermore, recent findings suggested that patients
harboring the Y640F mutation in STAT3 respond better
to methotrexate. For this patient we report herein, with
aggressive clinical presentation, intravenous injection of
CHOP-like chemotherapy may be a better option [32], but
unfortunately, intravenous CEOP chemotherapy didn’t
achieve a satisfactory outcome, and disease progression
with CNS involvement occurred during treatment.
Considering the patient who has got aggressive disease
with poor physical condition, could not sustain further
intravenous chemotherapy, metronomic regimen T-PEPC,
as an alternative was administrated.
The term metronomic chemotherapy was originally
coined in an editorial published in 2000 by Hanahan et al.
[33] , referring to the frequent, even daily administration
of cytotoxic drugs at comparatively low doses with
minimal or prolonged drug-free breaks [34] . As it can
maintain modest and acceptable toxicity profiles plus
lower cost resulting from fewer side-effect associated
expenditures and the usage of inexpensive oral drugs
such as cyclophosphamide compared with maximum
tolerated dose (MTD) regimens, have gained an increasing
popularity nowadays [35]. Furthermore, methyhydrazine
and thalidomide can infiltrate through the blood brain
barrier, which can control potential CNS infiltration.
This patient remained symptom-free and hematologic
remission in the latest follow-up for more than 8 months,

irregular shaped nuclei in cerebrospinal fluid. (WrightGiemsa stain, ×1, 000).

which suggests a better control of both systemic and
CNS diseases. Taken together, this is the first case of
aggressive T-LGL leukemia with phenotype of TCRαβ
and CD4-/CD8- which shows a CNS involvement during
chemotherapy and responded well to T-PEPC metronomic
regimen, suggesting that metronomic regimen should be a
better treatment option for such patients.

CONFLICTS OF INTERESTS

T-LGL leukemia usually is an indolent disease.
Here we reported a patient of aggressive T-LGL
leukemia accompanied with a unique immunophenotype
of CD3+CD4-CD8- CD5-CD7-TCRαβ+, and clinical
manifestations were lasting fever, splenomegaly and HLH
symptom. The patient therefore started a chemotherapy
of CEOP but pursued a disease progression and CNS
involvement during treatment. Thus T-PEPC metronomic
regimen was administrated as an alternative, considering
the elderly patient with fragile physical condition. The
patient gained a satisfactory outcome with such treatment
and remained 8-month symptom-free. Therefore, from
this case, we can conclude that T-LGL leukemia patients
with unique TCRɑβ, and phenotype variants of dual CD4-/
CD8- may pursue an aggressive clinical course and for
elderly patient that cannot sustain an intensive intravenous
chemotherapy, a relatively moderate chemotherapy like
metronomic regimen should be recommended.
