ABSTRACT:
While new drugs aimed at BRAF-mutated cancers are entering clinical practice, cells
and tumors with activating Ras mutations are relatively resistant to those and quite
a few other anti-cancer agents. This inspires the effort to reverse this resistance or
to uncover new vulnerabilities in such resistant cancers. IPA3 has been originally
identified as a small molecule inhibitor of p21-activated protein kinase 1 (PAK1), a
candidate therapeutic target in human malignancies. We have tested a battery of
melanoma and colon carcinoma cell lines that carry mutations in BRAF, NRAS and KRAS
genes and have observed that those with NRAS and KRAS mutations are more sensitive
to killing by IPA3. Genetic manipulations suggest that the differential response depends
not just on these oncogenes, but also on additional events that were co-selected
during tumor evolution. Furthermore, sublethal doses of IPA3 or ectopic expression
of dominant-negative PAK1 sensitized Ras-mutated cells to GDC-0897 and AZD6244,
which otherwise have reduced efficiency against cells with activated Ras. Dominantnegative PAK1 also reduced the growth of NRAS-mutated cells in confluent cultures,
but, unlike IPA3, caused no significant toxicity. Although it remains to be proven that
all the effects of IPA3 are exclusively due to inhibition of PAK1, our findings point to
the existence of selective vulnerabilities, which are associated with Ras mutations and
could be useful for better understanding and treatment of a large subset of tumors.

INTRODUCTION

components of MAP kinase cascade. BRAF gene
product is targeted by several of such compounds [1,
2] and is abnormally activated in various cancers,
including approximately half of all human melanomas
[3-5] (discussed in [6]). Selective reliance on BRAF
activity by cancer, but not the normal cells, makes BRAF
inhibitors relatively safe and efficient against a subset of
melanomas, which are hardly amenable to conventional
chemotherapy[7]. Unfortunately, a significant subset of
melanomas and the majority of other tumors are initially
BRAF-independent, while BRAF-mutated cancers
eventually develop resistance in the course of therapy [7].
For example, resistance may arise from mutations in Ras
oncogenes [8] which, apparently, supply a signal that is
equivalent to, but is independent of, BRAF mutations.
This sustains the interest to discover BRAF-independent
vulnerabilities in these malignancies.

Discovery of unique vulnerabilities in cancer
cells has emerged as a major starting point for anticancer drug development. Serendipitous discovery of
cancer-specific toxins is now supplemented, if not yet
supplanted, by targeted development of small molecule
modulators of specific biochemical functions. Synergistic
advances in cancer genetics and in general knowledge
of cellular metabolism and signal transduction produce
the ever-growing list of desirable therapeutic targets.
The corresponding small molecule inhibitors, either
empirically discovered or rationally designed, are
currently transiting from pre-clinical pipelines into the
armamentarium of clinical oncology.
A prominent example of this phenomenon is
the emergence of candidate drugs that target various

P21-activated kinases or PAKs are a family of
evolutionary conserved enzymes that were originally
identified as downstream effectors of Rho GTPases.
Group I PAKs, which include PAK1, PAK2 and PAK3,
have the same general architecture, but distinct and,
occasionally, opposite biological roles. PAK1 in particular
has been associated with a variety of pathological
conditions, including cancer (reviewed in [9]). PAK1 is
an intermediate in several pathways, whose perturbation
is known to be oncogenic. For example, it is known to
be downstream of Rac1 [10], which, in turn, is activated
by oncogenic Ras proteins. PAK1 function has been
directly implicated in several aspects of Ras-mediated

transformation, at least in some rodent cell lines [11,
12]. PAK1 is also affected by PI3K pathway [13-18]
and, possibly, directly interacts with protooncogene Akt
[15, 18]. Among PAK1 targets are Raf proteins [19, 20],
which may explain PAK1 connection to MAPK cascade.
Finally, PAK1 has been implicated in several antiapoptotic mechanisms, as well as in the control of various
metabolic processes (reviewed in [9]). Overexpression or
activation of PAK1 has been reported in a large number
of malignancies and, not surprisingly, this kinase is
recognized a potential target for cancer therapy. A notable
step in that direction was a search for the inhibitors of
the interaction of PAK1 with its activator molecules [21].

Although the main discovery of this study, a compound
designated IPA3, does not have chemical properties
suitable for clinical use, it became an affordable and
convenient tool to manipulate PAK1 activity in cell culture
models (e.g. [22-26]), because it allows one to quickly
probe the dependence of various phenomena on PAK1.
In the current study, we have examined the differential
effects of IPA3, either alone or in combination with some
other MAPK cascade inhibitors, on cancer lines with
known mutations in Ras and BRAF genes.

generally, mutually exclusive occurrence of these changes
[27, 28]. NRAS is the most commonly mutated Ras
family member in melanoma, KRAS is predominantly
mutated in colon cancer, while BRAF mutations are found
in either malignancy. While either of these mutations may
lead to hyperactivation of the MAPK cascade, they are
likely to differ in the spectrum of additional changes
inflicted on the affected cell. In turn, this may result in
selective pressure to acquire different secondary mutations
and on differential dependence of various otherwise
normal cellular factors. Thus, each of these mutations may
create its unique pattern of vulnerabilities and resistances
to potentially cytotoxic impacts.
We examined five melanoma lines, three of which
were BRAF- and two NRAS-mutated, and four colon
carcinoma lines, of which three were KRAS- and one

RESULTS
Genetic data suggests that mutations in Ras and
BRAF oncogenes are somewhat equivalent during the
early stages of tumor development. This is inferred from,

BRAF-mutated. The cells were treated with various
doses of IPA3 and the response was recorded by
microphotography and by methylene blue staining and
extraction method (Figure 1A, B and C). We observed that
Ras-mutated cells, either melanomas or colon carcinomas,
were killed by the doses of IPA3, which affected the
morphology, but were hardly the viability of BRAFmutated cells of similar origin. In fact, we have repeatedly
seen that low doses of IPA3 had a small stimulating effect
on proliferation of some BRAF-mutated cell lines (Figure
1B and C, and unpublished). Overall, all BRAF-mutated
lines were more resistant than any of the Ras-mutated
ones, indicating a significant (p<0.02 by Mann-Whitney
test) difference between these two groups of cell lines.
The connection between oncogenic Ras and such
downstream effectors as ERKs is believed to be principally
mediated by CRAF kinase, which, in turn, supports the
activity of ERK activators, MEKs. However, other Raf
kinases, such as BRAF, could still be present in the same
cell. Although some functions of CRAF and BRAF are
similar, the contribution of BRAF to growth and survival
of such cells is expected to be overshadowed by that of
Ras/CRAF axis. This is best attested by insensitivity of
such cells to BRAF inhibitors. We have examined whether

IPA3 treatment affects the response of Ras-mutated lines
to BRAF inhibitor GDC-0879[29]. As expected, two
NRAS-mutated melanomas showed little response even
to relatively high doses of the drug (Figure 2A and B).
In fact, the doses of 2.5µM and 5µM of GDC-0879 are
much higher that the IC50 for BRAF-mutated lines ([29]
and Figure 3A). Remarkably, in the presence of otherwise
sublethal doses of IPA3, addition of the BRAF inhibitor
to otherwise resistant cells had a pronounced suppressive
effect, indicating that the two compounds cooperate.
In a reciprocal experiment, ectopic expression of
activated NRAS protected cells from BRAF inhibitor
GDC-0879 (Figure 3A), but failed to make them sensitive
to IPA3 (Figure 3B). We concluded that the distinct
response to the latter compound is, at least in part, dictated
by co-selected mutations rather than by different direct
effects of BRAF and Ras oncogenes.
We used a dominant-negative form of PAK1 (PAK1K299R) as an alternative way of affecting the function
of PAK1 in Ras-mutated cells. In comparison with an
empty vector, PAK1-K299R sensitized cells to GDC0879 (Figure 4A), AZD6244 (an inhibitor of MEK 1
and 2) (Figure 4B) and IPA3 (Figure 4C). In contrast to
IPA3, PAK1-K299K did not exhibit a noticeable cytotoxic

or cytostatic effect under normal culture conditions.
However, it reduced the growth of SK-MEL-103 (NRAS
mutant) in confluent cultures (Figure 5A-C). While the
control cells after reaching confluence continued uniform
growth as a multilayer culture (Figure 5B), a large
fraction of cells transduced with PAK1 mutant appeared
contact-inhibited and only a lesser fraction continued
proliferation and formed foci (Figure 5C). Of note, we
have previously observed the ability of PAK1-K299K to
reduce transformed phenotype, but not the viability, of
cells transduced with an oncogenic variant of Akt [13].

Differential sensitivity to IPA3 in Ras-mutated cell
lines and the ability of this compound, even in sublethal
concentrations, to sensitize these cells to other impacts
point to an important vulnerability, which might be
clinically explored in a single-agent or combined therapy.
The biochemical basis of the difference in drug response
between BRAF- and Ras-mutated cells remains unclear.
Our observations suggest that this phenomenon is not a
direct consequence of the activation of these oncogenes:
when we attempted to transfer the oncogenes between the

BRAF or CRAF inhibition.
The same transgene also sensitized to IPA3 itself,
which would be expected if the two impacts target the
same biochemical process. Sensitization to AZD6244
(aka Selumetinib) is in particular important, as it points
to an avenue of increasing the efficacy of the compound,
which is currently entering clinical practice. This may be
especially interesting in the view of the earlier reports that
Ras-mutated cells are, generally, more resistant to MEK
inhibitors than the BRAF-mutated ones [31, 32], and
this trend is seen upon clinical use of AZD6244[33]. The
effect of PAK1-K299R on the response to the inhibitors
of MAPK cascade is not surprising, since PAK1 has been
implicated in regulation of and in direct interaction with
various components of this pathway[13, 19, 20, 34, 35].
In addition, PAK1 has been implicated in various modes
of protection from apoptosis [36-40], and a reduction in
such an activity may have contributed to the observed
sensitization phenomena, although at the doses and
treatment times used in our experiments AZD6244 and
GDC-0897 are predominantly cytostatic (data not shown).
It is important to note that expression of PAK1K299R did not recapitulate the pronounced toxicity of
IPA3. The most trivial explanation for our results is that
the expression of the transgene varied between individual
infected cells and, on average, was insufficient to achieve
complete inhibition of the endogenous PAK1. This may
explain why confluent cultures of those cells appeared
more heterogeneous according to the measurements of cell
density (Figure 5A) and visual appearance (Figure 5C).
Another possibility is a difference in the ability of IPA3
and PAK1-K299R to suppress different Group I PAKs
or the proposed kinase-independent functions of PAK1

fluorescence, arbitrary units

cell lines, the status of IPA3 resistance did not follow the
transgene. It is tempting to speculate, that a PAK1-like
function is critical to these cancers, but in Ras-mutated
cells the signal to PAK1 originates directly from Ras, while
BRAF needs a cooperating event to achieve the same goal.
Assuming that the cooperating event is IPA3 insensitive,
this hypothesis agrees with our observations, although
alternative explanations are possible as well. The scenario,
in which genetic events that provide alternative solutions
to the same hurdle in the early cancer development steer
the evolution of the disease into significantly different
paths, is well-known from other systems (e.g. [30])
An important issue in this and other works that
utilize IPA3 is how specific this compound is. Its original
characterization included a diligent study of more than
two hundred other kinases, of which only a handful were
affected [21]. However, the few that were inhibited, along
with PAK2 and PAK3, which are also susceptible to
IPA3, have credible connections to cancer and cell death
(discussed in [9]). In this regard, the experiments with
alternative modes of PAK1 inhibition become important. A
recent paper reported concordant toxicity of IPA3 and an
anti-PAK1 shRNA in a number of cell lines [26], arguing
in favor of IPA3 specificity.
In our experiments, dominant-negative PAK1
resembled IPA3 in that it was able to sensitize Ras-mutated
cells to a BRAF inhibitor. Although GDC-0897 is very
specific against BRAF-mutated cells [29], we cannot rule
out that the observed effect is due to a residual activity of
GDC-0897 against CRAF . The issue of BRAF inhibitors
having some potency against CRAF is well recognized for
clinically used compounds[2], and the observed activity
of IPA3 may be significant if it proceeds either through

[41]. Nevertheless, it is impossible to completely rule out
that the difference between the effects of the dominantnegative PAK1 and IPA3 is, at least in part, due to some
unknown PAK1-independent activity of the latter.
An unbiased genetic screen [42] for the events that
protect cells from the toxicity of IPA3 may be warranted
in order to uncover critical molecular events, either PAK1
dependent or not, that are triggered by this compound in
cancer cells. Identification of such events would be an
important aid in developing new and, hopefully, clinicallyapplicable compounds with an IPA3-like effect on cancer
cells. As PAK1 itself has clearly emerged as a target for
cancer therapy (discussed in [9, 43]), the knowledge of
the ways, in which otherwise sensitive cells may gain
tolerance to inhibitors of this kinase, is likely to rise in
clinical significance.
