Abstract
Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a highly aggressive
tumor subtype lacking effective prognostic indicators or therapeutic targets. Mitochondrial function is dysregulated frequently in cancer cells to allow for adaptation to a harsh tumor
microenvironment. Targeting mitochondrial biogenesis and
bioenergetics is, therefore, an attractive therapeutic strategy. In
this study, we performed quantitative proteomic analyses in
human parental and metastatic breast cancer cell lines to
identify mitochondrial proteins involved in TNBC metastasis.
We found that single-strand DNA-binding protein 1 (SSBP1)
was downregulated in highly metastatic breast cancer cells.
Moreover, SSBP1 downregulation promoted TNBC cell metas-

tasis in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, SSBP1 loss decreased
mitochondrial DNA copy number, thereby potentiating calcineurin-mediated mitochondrial retrograde signaling that
induced c-Rel/p50 nuclear localization, activated TGFb promoter activity, and TGFb-driven epithelial-to-mesenchymal
transition. Low SSBP1 expression correlated with tumor progression and poor prognosis in patients. Collectively, our
ﬁndings identiﬁed SSBP1 as a novel metastasis suppressor and
elucidated the mechanisms by which dysregulated mitochondrial signaling contributes to metastatic potential, providing
potential new prognostic indicators for patients with TNBC.

Introduction

getic and biosynthetic states of mitochondria communicate
with the nucleus through mitochondrial retrograde signaling
to modulate signaling pathways and transcriptional circuits to
meet the requirements of cancer cells. Thus, the discovery of
novel biomarkers involved in this pathophysiologic process can
provide broad new insights into the mechanisms of tumorigenesis and tumor progression.
In our previous study, the highly metastatic cell line MDA-MB231HM was developed from parental MDA-MB-231 cells by in
vivo selection in mice. Accordingly, MDA-MB-231HM cells exhibited increased invasiveness to the lungs compared with parental
MDA-MB-231 cells. Another highly bone-metastatic cell line,
MDA-MB-231Bo, which was previously isolated via in vivo selection and also had stronger lung metastasis capacity compared
with MDA-MB-231 cells (Supplementary Fig. S1A), was obtained
from Dr. Toshiyuki Yoneda (The University of Texas, Houston,
TX; refs. 10, 11). Because of the similar genetic background of
these cells, they provide a unique model for identifying candidate
metastasis-associated biomarkers and potential therapeutic targets for TNBC. To discover mitochondrial biomarkers that may be
associated with TNBC progression, we thoroughly investigated
the mitochondrial proteome proﬁle of the MDA-MB-231 cell line
series. Using iTRAQ-labeling technology followed by nanoscale
high-performance liquid chromatography (nano-HPLC)-MS/MS,
we identiﬁed single-strand DNA-binding protein 1 (SSBP1) as a
differentially expressed protein associated with the metastatic
potential of TNBC.
SSBP1 (also known as mtSSB) exists in eukaryotic mitochondria (12). cDNA analysis revealed that SSBP1 is translated as a
148-amino acid polypeptide, and the ﬁrst 16 amino acids are

Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a highly aggressive
tumor subtype associated with poor prognosis. TNBC tumors
are generally larger in size and of a higher grade, often have
lymph node involvement at the time of diagnosis and tend to
more frequently affect younger patients (1–6). However, the
absence of well-deﬁned molecular targets for this tumor subtype makes TNBC treatment challenging (7–9). As the major
energy and metabolite source in cells, mitochondrial function is
often dysregulated in cancer, and there is growing interest in
understanding how altered mitochondrial function may be
targeted to inhibit tumor progression. The modiﬁed bioener-

SSBP1 Suppresses Triple-Negative Breast Cancer Metastasis

proposed to be removed after the import of this protein into the
mitochondria, resulting in a mature protein consisting of 132
amino acids (13). SSBP1 is distinct from nuclear SSB and plays an
important role in mtDNA replication, recombination, and repair
by binding to single-stranded mtDNA. SSBP1 has been shown to
stimulate the DNA polymerase activity of pol g in humans
(14, 15) and the unwinding activity of human mtDNA helicase
(16). In addition, SSBP1 stimulates strand-displacement DNA
synthesis promoted by the combined action of mtDNA helicase
(17). Recently, it has been reported that SSBP1 is associated with
human cancer. The level of SSBP1 protein correlates with the
aggressiveness of human osteosarcoma cells, suggesting a link
between mtDNA replication and cancer progression (18). SSBP1
has also been identiﬁed as a novel binding partner of the tumor
suppressor p53 in mitochondria biophysical measurements (19).
In this study, we show for the ﬁrst time that SSBP1 is a suppressor
of TNBC metastasis.

Materials and Methods
iTRAQ-nano-HPLC-MS/MS analyses
The cell lysates of parental MDA-MB-231 and highly metastatic
MDA-MB-231 (MDA-MB-231HM and MDA-MB-231Bo) breast
cancer cells were quantiﬁed using a Bradford assay, labeled with
iTRAQ-labeling reagents (Applied Biosystems), and digested with
trypsin. The resulting peptides were fractionated with a Waters
ultra-performance liquid chromatography device, and the fractions were then separated by nano-HPLC (Eksigent Technologies)
on a secondary reverse-phase (RP) analytical column. A Triple
TOF 4600 mass spectrometer (MS) was operated in informationdependent data acquisition mode to automatically switch
between MS and tandem MS (MS/MS) acquisition. MS/MS spectra were extracted and charge state deconvoluted using an MS Data
Converter from AB Sciex.
Cell culture
All breast cancer cell lines, normal breast MCF10A cells and
HEK 293T cells were obtained from the Shanghai Cell Bank, Type
Culture Collection Committee of Chinese Academy of Science
(Shanghai, China) in 2014, and they were authenticated using
short tandem repeat proﬁling by the cell bank. These cell lines
were conserved in our laboratory and subjected to routine cell line
quality examinations (e.g., morphology, Mycoplasma) by HD
Biosciences every 3 months. The cells for experiments were
passaged for less than 6 months. The MDA-MB-231Bo cells,
obtained from Dr. Toshiyuki Yoneda (The University of Texas,
Houston, TX) were cultured in ATCC-formulated Leibovitz L-15
medium supplemented with 10% FBS, 100 IU/mL penicillin, and
100 mg/mL streptomycin. The remaining cell lines were maintained in complete growth medium as recommended by the
manufacturers.
Study population
This study involved 250 breast cancer patients with a diagnosis of pathologically invasive ductal breast cancer with
a follow-up period of at least 5 years. The diagnoses were
veriﬁed by two independent pathologists in the Department
of Pathology of the Fudan University Shanghai Cancer Center
(FDUSCC). Samples were collected from these patients in the
Department of Breast Surgery of FDUSCC from August 2001 to
March 2006. This study was approved by the Ethics Committee

www.aacrjournals.org

of FDUSCC, and each participant signed an informed consent
document.
Tissue microarrays, IHC staining, and IHC variable evaluation
Tissue microarrays (TMA; Supplementary Table S1) were constructed from archival formalin-ﬁxed, parafﬁn wax-embedded
samples of carcinomas obtained from the 250 breast cancer
patients described above. Tissue cylinders with diameters of 2 mm
were punched from a previously marked tumor area in each block
(donor block) and inserted into a recipient parafﬁn wax block,
resulting in a 10  10 array. Tissue samples from all 250 patients
were punched twice into the microarray to compare staining
patterns in different areas of the same tumor. The brief details
of IHC staining, and IHC variable evaluation are described in the
Supplementary Methods.
Quantitative real-time PCR
Total RNA was extracted with the TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen)
and reverse transcribed using the PrimeScript RT Reagent Kit
(Perfect Real-Time; TaKaRa Biotechnology). Subsequently, realtime PCR was performed with SYBR Premix Ex Taq (TaKaRa Bio)
using an ABI Prism 7900 instrument (Applied Biosystems).
mtDNA content was measured by real-time PCR using speciﬁc
primers for the mtDNA-encoded cytochrome oxidase I and nuclear DNA-encoded GAPDH.

SSBP1 shRNAs and the negative control were purchased from
GeneChem and expressed in the GV248 backbone. The target
sequences are as follows:
shRNA-1: 50 -AGTTTGGTTCTTGAAAGAT-30 ;
shRNA-2: 50 -TGGCACAGAATATCAGTAT-30 .
Lentivirus packaging and infection
Brieﬂy, 293T cells were cotransfected with lentiviral vectors and
the packaging vectors PCDH (or GV248), psPAX2 and pMD2G.
Forty-eight hours after transfection, the viral supernatants were
collected, ﬁltered, and concentrated by ultracentrifugation. Polybrene (Sigma-Aldrich) was added at a working concentration of 8
mg/mL. The cells were incubated with virus for 12 hours, and then
medium containing FBS was added. Twenty-four hours later, the
infected cells were subjected to selection with 2 mg/mL puromycin
for 1 week.
Western blot analysis
Whole-cell lysates were generated using Pierce T-PER (Tissue
Protein Extraction Reagent; Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc Inc.) containing protease inhibitor cocktail tablets (Roche) and phosphatase inhibitors (Roche). In total, 30 mg of the cell lysates
were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene
ﬂuoride membranes (Pall). The membranes were blocked in
5% milk or 5% BSA, and then incubated with various primary
antibodies followed by the appropriate horseradish peroxidase–conjugated secondary antibodies. Immunoreactive bands
were identiﬁed using enhanced chemiluminescence, according
to the manufacturer's instructions, and quantiﬁed by densitometry. The antibodies used in this study are listed in Supplementary Table S2.
Transwell assays
Cells (5  105 for the migration assay and 1  106 for the
invasion assay) were plated in the top chamber of a non-coated
membrane or Matrigel-coated Transwell chambers (BD Biosciences) in medium without FBS. Medium supplemented with
serum was used as a chemoattractant in the bottom chamber. The
cells were incubated for 15 to 20 hours, and cells that did not
migrate through the pores were removed with a cotton swab. The
cells on the lower surface of the membrane were stained with
methanol and 0.1% crystal violet and then counted.
Calcineurin activity
Calcineurin activity was measured using a calcineurin activity
assay kit (Millipore) according to the manufacturer's instructions.
Brieﬂy, total phosphatase activity in cellular extracts was measured by incubation with a calcineurin-speciﬁc RII phosphopeptide substrate in the presence or absence of EGTA. The detection of
free phosphate release is based on the malachite green assay in the
presence of EGTA, which was subtracted from the total activity to
obtain calcineurin-speciﬁc phosphatase activity.
Measurement of mitochondrial membrane potential
Tumor cells plated in phenol red–free growth medium were
treated with 1 mg/mL JC-1 dye for 30 minutes at 37 C and
analyzed by FACS. Red or green JC-1 ﬂuorescence signals were
resolved by detection in the FL1 and FL3 channels, respectively.
Loss of mitochondrial membrane potential was measured by a
reduction in the red/green ﬂuorescence intensity ratio.

Measurement of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species
Mitochondrial-speciﬁc superoxide production was measured
by labeling live cells with MitoSOX-Red (Invitrogen). Cells were
incubated with 5 mmol/L MitoSOX-red for 20 minutes at 37 C in
serum-free DMEM, washed twice with Dulbecco PBS, and then
immediately analyzed by FACS.
Phosphoprotein proﬁling with the Phospho Explorer
antibody microarray
The Phospho Explorer antibody microarray, which was
designed and manufactured by Full Moon Biosystems, Inc., contains 1,318 antibodies. Each antibody has two replicates that are
printed on a coated glass microscope slide together with multiple
positive and negative controls. The antibody array experiment was
performed according to an established protocol.
Immunoﬂuorescence
MCF10A-stable cell lines grown on coverslips were ﬁxed with
4% paraformaldehyde for 30 minutes at room temperature,
permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 for 5 minutes at 4 C, and
incubated with primary antibodies for 2 hours at 37 C. The slides
were then incubated with Alexa 695–conjugated (red; Abcam) or
Alexa 594–conjugated (red; Invitrogen) secondary antibodies for
40 minutes at room temperature. Images were captured with a
confocal laser microscope (Leica TCS SP5 II). At least 100 cells
were analyzed for each group.
Metastasis assays in nude mice
All animal work was performed in accordance with the guidelines of the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of
Fudan University under approved protocols. In total, 5  105 cells
were washed in PBS and injected intravenously into female BALB/c
nude mice (n ¼ 6) to study lung metastasis activity. Noninvasive
bioluminescence imaging was performed to quantify the metastasis burden in target organs using an in vivo imaging system.
Luciferase assay
In the luciferase reporter assays, HEK 293T cells were seeded in
96-well plates at a density of 1  104 to 2  104 cells per well and
cultured for 24 hours followed by cotransfection with c-Rel or the
expression control vector at 150 mg/well; TGFb luciferase constructs of different promoter lengths at 150 mg/well; or the
promoter control vector pGL3-basic with 7.5 ng/well of the
control Renilla luciferase reporter construct pRL-TK (Promega).
After 48 hours, luciferase assays were performed as recommended
by the Dual-Glo Luciferase Assay System (Promega) detected by a
SynergyHT Multi-Mode Microplate Reader (BioTek) at 595 nm.
Primers for plasmid construction are listed in Supplementary
Table S3.
Chromatin immunoprecipitation
After incubating with 1% formaldehyde at room temperature
for 10 minutes, the cells were pelleted and resuspended in 200
mL of lysis buffer (1% SDS; 10 mmol/L EDTA; 50 mmol/L TrisHCl, pH 8.0). The cell lysates were then sonicated (Sonics &
Materials, Inc.) until the DNA was cleaved into fragments of
200 to 500 bp. These extracts were immunoprecipitated using
anti–c-Rel or normal mouse IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology,
Inc.), and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) experiments
were performed using the EZ–Magna G Chromatin

Immunoprecipitation Kit (Millipore, Merck KGaA) according
to the manufacturer's instructions. Subsequently, PCR for the
TGFb promoter was performed using speciﬁc primers, which
are listed in Supplementary Table S4.
Statistical analyses
Results are reported as the mean  SD or the mean  SEM as
indicated in the ﬁgure legends. The results were analyzed using the
SPSS 16.0 software (SPSS) and PRISM 5.0 (GraphPad Software
Inc.). Comparisons of quantitative data between two groups were
analyzed with the Student t test (two-tailed; P < 0.05 was considered signiﬁcant). The c2 test was used to compare qualitative
variables. Cumulative survival time was calculated using the
Kaplan–Meier method, which was analyzed using the log-rank
test. Univariate and multivariate analyses were based on the Cox
proportional hazards regression model. P values <0.05 were
considered signiﬁcant.

Results
Identiﬁcation of SSBP1 as a downregulated gene in highly
metastatic breast cancer cells
Using the iTRAQ-labeling method with our model system,
we analyzed MDA-MB-231 (human breast cancer) cell and its
derived highly metastatic sublines MDA-MB-231HM and MDAMB-231Bo (Fig. 1A). Our analysis spanned two pairs of cell
lines allowing for overlapped comparisons of mitochondrial
proteins from matched parental and derivative cell lines. To
generate mitochondrial proteins based on quantitative abundance data, we considered proteins upregulated or downregulated at least 1.5-fold in highly metastatic variants as compared
with their matched, parental cell lines. This analysis yielded
quantitative mitochondrial proteins consisting of 50 and 66
proteins for the 231HM/231 and 231Bo/231 comparisons,
respectively (part of results showed in Supplementary Table
S5). We focused our interesting candidate on one protein
SSBP1, which is signiﬁcantly downregulated in MDA-MB231HM and MDA-MB-231Bo cells compared with the parental
MDA-MB-231 cells (Fig. 1B and Supplementary Fig. S1B–S1E).
In addition to these two metastatic breast cancer cell lines, a
panel of breast cancer cell lines was also evaluated to observe
the general trend of SSBP1 gene expression. In accordance with
the iTRAQ results, SSBP1 mRNA expression was generally
observed in luminal breast cancer cells (MCF-7, T47D, and
ZR-75-30), which are considered weakly metastatic cell lines,
but SSBP1 was downregulated in basal-like breast cancer cells
(BT549, MDA-MB-468, and MDA-MB-231). In particular, the
highly metastatic cell lines (MDA-MB-231HM and MDA-MB231Bo) had greater decreases in SSBP1 expression levels
(Fig. 1C). In addition, Oncomine expression analysis revealed
SSBP1 downregulation in various human cancers (Fig. 1D). We
also studied the prognostic value of SSBP1 using an online
Kaplan–Meier plot for survival analysis. For the entire cohort of
patients and patients with basal-subtype tumors, low SSBP1
expression had a negative impact on relapse-free survival (Fig.
1E). However, SSBP1 expression did not correlate with relapsefree survival for patients with ER-positive and Her-2–positive
breast tumors (Fig. 1E). Furthermore, patients in The Cancer
Genome Atlas (TCGA) cohort with stomach adenocarcinoma
and SSBP1 gene alterations had notably shorter lifespans than
those with stomach adenocarcinoma without an SSBP1 gene

alteration (Supplementary Fig. S2A). Taken together, these data
suggest that SSBP1 may play an oncogenic role in multiple
cancer types, making it worthy of further investigation.
Loss of SSBP1 promotes breast cancer cell migration and
metastasis in vitro and in vivo
To further investigate the role of SSBP1 in tumor migration
and metastasis, we used three breast cancer cell line models
(MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-468, and MDA-MB-231Bo) for
in vitro Transwell migration and in vivo metastasis studies. First,
we used two independent shRNAs targeting SSBP1 in MDAMB-231 and MDA-MB-468 cells. An empty vector (shCon)
served as control. Western blot analysis demonstrated that
both shRNA constructs strongly reduced SSBP1 protein levels
(Fig. 2A). Furthermore, we generated an SSBP1 stably overexpressing MDA-MB-231Bo cell line (Fig. 2A), and the results
demonstrated that SSBP1 knockdown in MDA-MB-231 and
MDA-MB-468 cells signiﬁcantly promoted cell migration and
invasion in Transwell assays (Fig. 2B–E). Using a complementary inverse approach, elevated SSBP1 expression suppressed
the invasion ability of MDA-MB-231Bo cells in an invasion
assay (Fig. 2F and G).
Next, to examine whether SSBP1 affects invasion and metastasis in vivo, we constructed mouse models. We labeled SSBP1
knockdown MDA-MB-231 cells and SSBP1 stably overexpressing
MDA-MB-231Bo cells with a retroviral construct expressing a
GFP/luciferase fusion protein (20), and tumor cell colonization
and outgrowth in the lungs were monitored by noninvasive
bioluminescent imaging (BLI) 6 weeks after the intravenous
delivery of cells into the nude mice. Our results demonstrated
that low SSBP1 expression signiﬁcantly increased lung metastasis
in vivo, and the lung metastasis-promoting effect was reversed after
SSBP1 overexpression in MDA-MB-231Bo cells (Fig. 2H and I and
Supplementary Fig. S2B). These ﬁndings conﬁrm our hypothesis
that low SSBP1 expression promotes breast cancer cell metastasis
in vitro and in vivo.
Downregulation of SSBP1 induces mitochondria retrograde
signaling
As SSBP1 is essential for mtDNA replication (14, 15), we
hypothesized that SSBP1 downregulation would reduce the
mtDNA content in cells. First, we assessed the relative mtDNA
copy number by speciﬁc primers. We found that compared with
control cells, the mtDNA copy number in MDA-MB-231
shSSBP1#1 and MDA-MB-468 shSSBP1#1 cells was signiﬁcantly
decreased without obvious differences in the ampliﬁcation of the
GAPDH nuclear gene (Fig. 3B). Furthermore, MDA-MB-231Bo
cells had a greater decrease in mtDNA copy number compared
with the parental MDA-MB-231 cells (Fig. 3A), indicating that the
mtDNA copy number is associated with tumor metastasis. Next,
to determine whether the reduced mtDNA content potentiates
mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and loss
of the mitochondrial membrane potential (Dym), we examined
the level of mitochondrial ROS generation and Dym in MDA-MB231 and MDA-MB-468 cells. As shown in Fig. 3C and D, there was
a signiﬁcant increase in mitochondrial ROS generation and Dym
loss in SSBP1-downregulated cells. In addition, it showed that all
these downstream changes similarly generated when mtDNA
copy number was reduced in MDA-MB-231 cells by treated
with ethidium bromide (EB). We used 30 ng/mL of EB, which
is the concentration required for partial depletion of mtDNA

(Supplementary Fig. S3A). The mtROS levels and p-SMAD3 levels
were increased markedly in "mtDNA-reduced" MDA-MB-231
cells (MDA-MB-231 EB; Supplementary Fig. S3B and S3C).
Accordingly, the "mtDNA-reduced" cells acquired increased
migratory capacity (Supplementary Fig. S3D).
Dysfunctional mitochondria involved in increased ROS production and Dym loss in mammalian cells can trigger changes
in mitochondrial Ca2þ signaling, reducing the energetic drive
for mitochondria Ca2þ import and increasing the cytosolic
Ca2þ concentration, thus activating calcineurin (21). For these
reasons, we assessed the role of SSBP1 in calcineurin activation

956 Cancer Res; 76(4) February 15, 2016

and found that SSBP1 downregulation played a role in increased
calcineurin activity in both MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 cells
(Fig. 3E). Conversely, SSBP1 overexpression in MDA-MB-231Bo
cells decreased calcineurin activity (Fig. 3E). Taken together, these
results indicate that SSBP1 loss activates the calcineurin-dependent
mitochondrial retrograde signaling pathway in breast cancer cells.
Knockdown of SSBP1 induces c-Rel/p50 nuclear localization
and activates TGFb promoter activity

the enhanced metastasis due to decreased SSBP1 expression, we

surveyed potential signaling pathways using a phospho-antibody
microarray technique. Analysis of the array revealed the induction
of several key components of the NF-kB and TGFb/SMAD pathways as a result of SSBP1 depletion, including NF-kB-p105/p50
(phospho-Ser893), NF-kB-p105/p50 (phospho-Ser337), SMAD2
(phospho-Ser467), and SMAD3 (phospho-Ser204; Fig. 4A). As

shRNA induced the inactivation of IkBb (Supplementary Fig.

subunit of calcineurin) overexpressing MDA-MB-231 cells as
positive controls. Results showed that addition of CCCP and
overexpression of CnA caused reduced cytoplasmic IkBb levels
and increased nuclear c-Rel/p50 levels, which was similar as
transfection with SSBP1 shRNA. In addition, more results showed
that all these changes could be reversed by FK506, a calcineurin
inhibitor (23). FK506 treatment was used as a control to ascertain
the role of shSSBP1-induced calcineurin activation in IkBb reduction and c-Rel/p50 nuclear translocation. The addition of FK506
resulted in restoration of IkBb and decreased c-Rel/p50 in both
cells transfected with SSBP1 shRNA and CnA (Supplementary Fig.
S3E and S3F).
Moreover, as a result of SSBP1 downregulation, MDA-MB231 and MDA-MB-468 cells produced higher amounts of TGFb
protein and mRNA. In contrast, SSBP1 overexpression inhibited TGFb production in MDA-MB-231Bo cells. Thus, we
hypothesized that the c-Rel–p50 complex could activate TGFb
transcription. To investigate this possibility, we performed
ChIP assays of SSBP1-downregulated MDA-MB-231 cells followed by PCR of the conserved TGFb promoter region encompassing the consensus c-Rel–binding motifs. Chromatin immunoprecipitates from the c-Rel antibody were enriched for the
TGFb promoter region compared with those precipitated with
an IgG control, conﬁrming that this region contains a c-Rel–
binding site. To further identify the role of SSBP1 depletion in
regulating TGFb promoter transcription, a DNA fragment
between 1,033 and þ316 relative to TGFb transcription start
site (TSS) was cloned into a pGL3-Basic plasmid to yield pGL3–
TGFb recombinant vector delivering TGFb promoter (Fig. 4D
and E). Results showed that sequence constructs P1, P2, and P3
increased the luciferase activity in 293T cells, but sequence P4
remained the luciferase activity similar as the control, indicating that c-Rel was able to increase the transcriptional activity of
the TGFb promoter by binding to the region located between
500 and þ316 upstream of the TSS (Fig. 4F). These ﬁndings
conﬁrm that the loss of SSBP1 induces c-Rel/p50 nuclear
localization, leading to increased TGFb transcription.
SSBP1 regulates TGFb signaling and TGFb-induced epithelialto-mesenchymal transition
Analysis of the antibody array revealed the induction of several
key proteins within the TGFb–SAMD pathway as a result of SSBP1
depletion. We next investigated the effects of SSBP1 modulation
on key components of the TGFb–SMAD pathway and found the
elevated production of TGFb and increased phosphorylation of
SMAD3 (S423þS425), a key mediator of TGFb signaling, in both
MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 SSBP1-deﬁcient cells (Fig. 5A–
C). In contrast, SSBP1 overexpression in MDA-MB-231Bo cells
markedly reduced TGFb secretion and downregulated p-SMAD3
protein levels (Fig. 5A–C). Moreover, we examined the expression
of other components of the TGFb pathway, including TGFb

receptor 1 (TbR1) and SMAD7, but no changes were observed
(Fig. 5C).
TGFb stimulates the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition
(EMT), migration, invasion, and metastasis of breast cancer cells.
MCF10A cells are a classical in vitro EMT experimental model
(24, 25). MCF10A cells with stable SSBP1 depletion have typical
EMT characteristics. Western blot and immunoﬂuorescence assays
demonstrated that SSBP1 deﬁciency resulted in lower E-cadherin
expression and higher N-cadherin and ﬁbronectin expression. Of
note, treatment with GW788388 and MitoTEMPO, an inhibitor of
TGFb/SMAD3 signaling and mitochondrial ROS, respectively
(26–28), mitigated the effects of SSBP1 deﬁciency on the cell
invasive ability and EMT (Fig. 5D–G). In addition, it showed that
EMT phenotype changes similarly generated when mtDNA copy
number was reduced in MCF10A cells by treated with EB. And
treatment with MitoTEMPO reversed the effects of EB on EMT in
MCF10A-EB cells (Supplementary Fig. S3G). Furthermore, qRTPCR analysis of MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 cells after
shRNA-mediated SSBP1 knockdown indicated that SSBP1 depletion was required for the efﬁcient induction of metastasis-related
TGFb target genes, such as IL11, PTHrP, Snail1, and Snail2.
Together, these results suggest that SSBP1 depletion potentiates
TGFb/SMAD signaling and TGFb-driven EMT.
Low SSBP1 expression correlates with SMAD3 activation and
poor clinical outcome
To determine the clinical relevance of the above ﬁndings in
advanced human cancers, we ﬁrst analyzed the Oncomine database and found that SSBP1 is downregulated in various human
cancers (Fig. 1D). On the basis of these data, downregulation or
loss of SSBP1 may be an early event in tumorigenesis that contributes to metastasis. In addition, using the cBio database (29),
patients with stomach adenocarcinoma and SSBP1 gene alterations have shorter lifespans than those with stomach adenocarcinoma without an SSBP1 alteration in the TCGA cohort.
In light of our observations, we sought to determine whether
SSBP1 and p-SMAD3 levels correlated with breast cancer
patient prognosis. We examined the expression of SSBP1 and
p-SMAD3 in TMAs containing 250 breast tumor specimens
by immunohistochemical analysis (Fig. 6A). Of note, patients with low SSBP1 expression were signiﬁcantly associated
with histologic grades (grades III and IV; P ¼ 0.01, Pearson
c2 test; Fig. 6B) and lymph node metastasis (P ¼ 0.009;
Fig. 6B). Importantly, low SSBP1 expression and high
p-SMAD3 expression, alone or combined, correlated with
worse disease-free survival (Fig. 6C–E). Moreover, univariate
analysis indicated that low SSBP1 expression at diagnosis was
associated with a higher risk for disease relapse (Table 1).
Additional multivariate COX analysis exhibited a similar
trend as the univariate analysis (Table 1). Finally, we tested
the correlation between SSBP1 and p-SMAD3 expression in the

use of SSBP1 for prognostic stratiﬁcation of patients with

SMAD-dependent TGFb signaling.

breast cancer cells, which initiates the calcineurin-mediated mitochondrial retrograde signaling pathway to alter nuclear gene
expression. The importance of retrograde signaling has been
demonstrated for changes in mitochondrial Ca2þ signaling and
mitochondrial ROS production (30). Decreases in mitochondrial
membrane electrochemical potential reduce the energetic drive
for mitochondria to import Ca2þ, disrupting Ca2þ homeostasis in
the cytoplasm (21, 31). Numerous studies have supported a role
for mtDNA defects in tumorigenesis in a wide range of human
cancers (32–36), but the upstream regulators of mtDNA alteration remain largely elusive. Here, our data demonstrate that
SSBP1 downregulation regulated mtDNA content, activated

mitochondrial retrograde signaling, and drove EMT in breast
cancer cells. This ﬁnding led to the identiﬁcation of SSBP1 as a
novel mitochondrial biomarker for breast tumor progression.
The TGFb–SMAD pathway has been shown to play a role in
tumor progression and EMT. Tumor cells normally secrete
abundant TGFb, which is the most potent inducer of EMT in
epithelial cancers and promotes cell invasion and metastasis
(37, 38). TGFb exerts its effects through the activation of its
receptor and phosphorylated major effector SMADs (SMAD2/
SMAD3) translocate to the nucleus to activate EMT (39).
Although substantial data have clariﬁed the downstream
molecular networks that trigger EMT through TGFb, the regulatory controls of the oncogenic functions of TGFb have not
been well elucidated. More importantly, elucidation of the
regulatory controls governing the function of TGFb is critical
for the design of novel therapies targeting the oncogenic arm of
the pathway. Our data show that SSBP1 loss results in calcineurin-mediated mitochondrial retrograde signaling, which
plays a causal role in inducing c-Rel/p50 nuclear localization
and activating TGFb transcription. These results indicate that
SSBP1 may serve as a novel negative regulator of TGFb–
SMAD3-driven EMT.
When activated, EMT is thought to be a driver of invasion and
metastasis in different types of epithelial cancers and to potentiate
cancer cell resistance to current chemotherapies (40). The results
from MCF10A cells with SSBP1 downregulation are consistent
with the induction of a mesenchymal transdifferentiation program. Loss of SSBP1 in MCF10A cells results in a partial EMT
morphology change, including the upregulation of ﬁbronectin
and N-cadherin, well-known markers of early EMT induction.
Thus, cumulative results indicate that SSBP1 loss may play an
early role in the induction of EMT.
In addition, using Oncomine expression analysis, we showed
that SSBP1 undergoes a copy-number reduction in many human
cancers, including breast cancer, suggesting that the potential
importance of SSBP1 in initiation and progression is not limited
to breast cancer. On the basis of data from the TCGA cohort,
patients with stomach adenocarcinoma and SSBP1 gene alterations have shorter lifespans than those with stomach adenocarcinoma without an SSBP1 alteration. Moreover, p-SMAD3 levels
correlated with SSBP1 levels in our breast cancer TMA, further
validating that SSBP1 plays an essential role in the control of
TGFb–SMAD pathways. Furthermore, low SSBP1 expression is
closely associated with breast cancer metastasis in mouse cancer
models. TMAs of samples from breast cancer patients revealed
that low SSBP1 and high p-SMAD3 expression correlated with
poor prognosis. Our results suggest that further studies should

www.aacrjournals.org

examine the potential clinical utility of SSBP1 and p-SMAD3 as
prognostic biomarkers for aggressive disease.
In summary, using a combination of in vivo and in vitro
functional metastasis assays and extensive clinical correlation
analysis, we provide compelling evidence that SSBP1 is a
tumor suppressor involved in breast cancer and provide a
novel paradigm for SSBP1-mediated activation of mitochondrial retrograde signaling, increased TGFb transcription, and
subsequent TGFb–SMAD3-driven cell invasion and cancer
metastasis (Fig. 6H). In contrast, in the presence of SSBP1,
TGFb secretion decreases, and the oncogenic TGFb–EMT signaling is restrained. In recent years, many studies have demonstrated that various TGFb antagonists have partial success in
clinical trials (41, 42). Our ﬁndings that SSBP1 deﬁciency
promotes invasion and metastasis, whereas its overexpression
restricts this process provide insights into mechanisms and
strategies for the therapeutic intervention of the TGFb pathway
and cancer metastasis.
