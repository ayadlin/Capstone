Prognostic Factors for Survival in
Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma
Update 2008*
Ronald M. Bukowski, MD

A variety of prognostic factor models to predict survival in patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma
have been developed. Diverse populations of patients with variable treatments have been used for these
analyses. A variety of clinical, pathologic, and molecular factors have been studied, but current models use
predominantly easily obtained clinical factors. These approaches are reviewed, and current approaches to

The incidence of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is increasing worldwide,1 and currently, it is expected that
more than 220,000 new cases will be reported, with approximately 39,000 cases being diagnosed in the
United States.2 If detected early, RCC can be treated surgically, and 5-year survival rates approaching 85%
can be achieved for patients with organ-confined disease (stages T1, T2, and N0).3 In reality, 40% to 50%
of patients develop metastatic disease. Twenty percent to 30% present with metastases, and 20% to 30%
relapse distantly after curative nephrectomy (20%-30%).3 Treatment options for these patients are limited, and expected 5-year survival is approximately 10%.3
Metastatic RCC (mRCC) is generally resistant to chemotherapy and hormonal therapy and marginally sensitive to immunotherapy. The importance of mutations in the VHL gene and the resulting overexpression of the proangiogenic protein vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in RCC have been
recognized,4 and therapy targeting the VEGF-VEGF receptor signaling pathway is now the standard of
care. Five new agents, sorafenib5 and sunitinib malate6 (inhibitors of multiple tyrosine kinases), bevacizumab7 (a monoclonal antibody binding all the isoforms of VEGF A), and temsirolimus8 and everolimus9
(mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitors), have recently received or will soon receive regulatory approval by either the Food and Drug Administration or the European Medicines Agency.

Despite these advances, mRCC remains incurable.
The poor outlook for these patients combined with a variable natural history makes understanding and identifying
factors that affect outcome an important consideration for
patient care and the development and evaluation of new
treatments for this disease. At the design stage of comparative studies, they can be used to stratify patients to ensure
treatment arm balance, improve treatment comparisons,
and aid sample size calculations. During analysis, adjustment for known prognostic factors can clarify differences
between the treatments and assist in determining whether
they are altering the natural history of mRCC. Finally,
understanding the influence of biomarkers on prognosis
can assist drug development and aid in the design of new
targeted therapies.

Prognostic Factors in Patients With mRCC
Prognostic factor analyses in patients with mRCC have
focused on survival as the primary endpoint, because it is
well defined and objective, as well as being the ultimate
determinant of clinical benefit. In some recent reports,
however, objective tumor regression or progression-free
survival (PFS) has been used as a surrogate of clinical
benefit.
Retrospective analysis of untreated and previously
treated patients with mRCC has identified clinical characteristics that can be used to categorize patients into groups
with differences in prognosis. Most analyses have included
patients receiving cytokines and/or those refractory to this
therapy. The development of a new treatment paradigm
for patients with advanced RCC includes a variety of targeted agents; therefore, recent analyses have been conducted on this patient population to determine whether
similarities in prognostic factors exist.
2274

Demographic and Clinical Factors
Multiple studies assessing demographic and clinical predictors of survival in mRCC have been conducted.10-12 These
reports have focused on patients treated in clinical trials
and have used various methods, such as multivariate analysis and occasionally internal and/or external validation.
Table 1 outlines various factors examined in these reports.
The Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group
(ECOG)13 performance status (PS) is a subjective measure
of overall well-being. Although subjective, it is a clinical
factor consistently identified as an independent predictor
of survival.14-16 Patients with mRCC can present with a
variety of constitutional symptoms, including weight loss,
fatigue, fever, decreased appetite, and musculoskeletal
pain, which are generally correlated with PS. Leibovich
et al17 found a constellation of symptoms, including
weight loss, decreased appetite, musculoskeletal pain,
respiratory symptoms, gastrointestinal disturbances, sweats,
and rashes, but not PS, to have prognostic importance.
Laboratory abnormalities, including anemia, hypercalcemia, liver dysfunction, neutrophilia, thrombocytosis,
and elevated markers of inflammation, are present in
patients with advanced RCC. The most consistent finding
is an association between proinflammatory markers
(erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein level,
ferritin level, a1-antitrypsin level) and decreased survival.18-21
Hypercalcemia, generally defined as a corrected
(free) serum calcium level above 10 mg/dL, has also been
identified as an independent predictor of poor survival by
Motzer et al15,22 and Mekhail et al16 The prognostic value
of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and serum alkaline phosphatase has been evaluated, but results are variable. Neves
et al,10 Mekhail et al,16 and Donskov von der Maase,23

using a cutoff of 1.5 times the upper limit of the laboratory’s reference range, and Atzpodien et al19 and Wittke
et al,24 using cutoffs of 220 to 240 U/L, all found elevated
LDH levels to independently predict poor survival.
Hematologic parameters, including anemia and
neutrophil, lymphocyte, and platelet counts, have also
been assessed. Anemia has generally been defined as a hemoglobin value below the lower limit of the laboratory’s
reference range. In the reports by Motzer et al15 and
Mekhail et al,16 anemia as defined was found to be an independent predictor of survival. Thrombocytosis has been
less frequently evaluated and may also be related to
inflammation and elevated levels of interleukin 6. Suppiah et al25 identified a pretreatment platelet count
>400,000 cells/lL as prognostic for poor survival in a
database study of 700 previously untreated patients,
whereas Negrier et al20 found no such association in multivariate analysis, although thrombocytosis was prognostic
in univariate analysis.
A variety of disease-related factors, including sites of
metastases, disease-free intervals, and tumor burden, have
also been assessed. Common sites of metastatic spread in
RCC include the lungs, lymph nodes, liver, bone, and
brain.3 The impact of specific sites of metastatic disease
on survival, tumor burden (number of involved sites), and
tumor aggressiveness (interval between diagnosis and the
development or treatment of metastatic disease, called the
disease-free interval [DFI]) has been extensively studied.
Most investigators assessing these features have reported
them to be independent predictors of survival.
Several studies have identified various sites of metastatic disease to have prognostic significance; however, the
number of involved sites appears to be a good surrogate
for these individual sites. In multivariate analysis, the
number of metastatic sites appears to be a strong independent prognostic factor.10,11,14,16,26-28 The definitions
used, however, have varied. Most investigators have
included all involved sites; however, some have restricted
the count to specific organs. The estimated increased risk
of death due to more extensive disease ranged from 24%
to 286%, an effect most likely related to the variable definitions used but also to changes in imaging technologies
introduced during the past 30 years.29
As with tumor burden, DFI has been determined in
a variety of ways. Most studies have defined prognosis in
terms of the DFI being less than or greater than 1

year,11,12,15,16,20 2 years,14,26,28 or 3 years,19 or measured
on a continuum.30 Despite these variations, these studies
have consistently demonstrated an increased risk of death
for patients with short DFI.
Cytoreductive nephrectomy in patients with synchronous metastatic disease appears to improve outcome
in prospective randomized trials.31 Retrospective analyses
by Landonio et al,26 Fyfe et al,30 and Stadler et al32 also
found a history of nephrectomy to be associated with
improved survival.

Memorial Sloan-Kettering Prognostic Model
In view of the number of previous reports assessing prognostic factors, use of a single model that can be easily
applied is desirable. For previously untreated patients, an
initial prognostic model was developed at Memorial
Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center15 (MSKCC) and later
validated and expanded at the Cleveland Clinic16 (Fig. 1).
Five clinical characteristics, plus 2 additional independent
prognostic factors,15,16 were identified. The MSKCC
prognostic criteria have been used in recent phase 3 clinical trials of sorafenib, sunitinib, temsirolimus, and bevacizumab plus interferon for patient stratification.
In previously treated patients, low Karnofsky PS
(<80%), low serum hemoglobin level, and high corrected
calcium level were identified as risk factors. Prognostic
groups were defined as zero risk factors (favorable risk), 1
risk factor (intermediate risk), and 2 or 3 risk factors (poor
risk), with median overall survival times of 22.1 months,
12 months, and 5 months, respectively.22 These models
use a variety of clinical and laboratory factors, but tumorassociated and molecular markers have not been incorporated. Currently, the widespread use of this model in clinical trials, and the fact it has been validated externally,
make it the standard prognostic factor model in patients
with metastatic disease. The patients included had received
either cytokine therapy or chemotherapy, and therefore,
patients treated with kinase and/or VEGF inhibitors have
also been examined to assess prognostic factors.

standard of care for patients with metastatic RCC.

FIGURE 1. Prognostic factor models in treatment-naive patients with renal cell carcinoma are shown. Patients are from the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center15 and the Cleveland Clinic Taussig Cancer Center.16 Favorable risk (FR), intermediate risk (IR),
and poor risk (PR) groups are illustrated. Adverse risk factors identified include performance status <80%, lactate dehydrogenase level 1.5 times or more the upper limit normal, corrected calcium level >10.0 mg/dL, disease-free interval <1 year, and hemoglobin level less than the lower limit normal.

Choueiri and colleagues33 recently reported clinical factors in 120 patients treated with sunitinib, axitinib, bevacizumab, or sorafenib. A total of 63% of patients had
received prior therapy and histologically contained clear
cell components. The PFS was examined, and the median
for the group was 13.8 months. Multivariate analysis
identified the following independent adverse prognostic
factors: time from diagnosis to current therapy <2 years,
neutrophil >4.5 K/lL, platelets count >300 K/lL,
ECOG PS >0, and corrected calcium level <8.5 mg/dL
or >10.0 mg/dL. Three subgroups were then identified: 1
or fewer factors, 2 factors, 3 or more factors, with respective median PFS times of 20.1, 13.0, and 3.9 months. In
the future, incorporation of biomarkers and tumor-associated factors in such models will be necessary.
In addition, Escudier et al34 reported an analysis of
prognostic factors in 300 patients with cytokine refractory
mRCC treated in a randomized blinded trial comparing
2276

an aqueous shark cartilage extract (AE-941, Neovastat), a
putative angiogenesis inhibitor, with a placebo. The median overall survival and PFS times were 12.6 and 2.0
months, respectively. The factors associated with shorter
survival were 2 or more metastatic sites, DFI of 2 years or
less, high alkaline phosphatase level, LDH level of 1.5 or
more times the upper limit of normal, and abnormal corrected serum calcium level. Patients with 0, 1, 2, or 3 or
more adverse factors had median survival times of 15.6,
11.7, 8.5, and 3.5 months, respectively.

Tumor-associated and Pathologic Factors
Pathologic features, such as nuclear grade, DNA ploidy,
and histologic subtype, have been assessed as potential
prognostic factors. In unselected series of patients with
RCC, nuclear grade is frequently identified as a strong
independent predictor of survival (Zisman et al,35 Frank
Cancer

May 15, 2009

Prognostic Factors for RCC Survival/Bukowski

et al,36 and Patard et al37). Once RCC metastasizes, however, there is little evidence that grade affects survival.16,17,21,32 Tumor grade has been criticized because it
is subjective, and variability among pathologists has been
recognized.38 This has led to use of more quantitative
measures to describe the size of the nuclei and/or their
shape. Many of these parameters are correlated with histopathologic factors, such as stage and grade, and in univariate analyses with survival.39-41
Studies evaluating DNA ploidy have reported that
patients with aneuploid tumors have a poor prognosis
compared with patients with diploid tumors,42 whereas
others have found no association between ploidy and outcome.43 The possibility that tumor heterogeneity and variability in samples assessed42,43 are responsible for these
discrepancies is acknowledged.
A retrospective analysis by Patard et al37 of more
than 4000 patients with RCC seen at multiple institutions
demonstrated a clear trend in outcome based on histologic
subtype in univariate analysis. Considering all patients,
those with clear cell tumors had an estimated 5-year survival rate of 64% compared with 70% for patients with
papillary tumors and 84% for patients with chromophobe
tumors (P < .001). These differences were not apparent
once adjustments were made for the effects of TNM stage,
nuclear grade, and ECOG PS. Mani et al44 and Leibovich
et al17 both identified the presence of sarcomatoid features
as an independent predictor of poor outcome. Mekhail
et al16 identified any non-clear cell histologic subtype
(mostly papillary) as being a poor prognostic factor.

Molecular Prognostic Factors
A variety of molecular markers have also been assessed in
patients with mRCC, including chromosomal abnormalities, expression of various hypoxia-related molecules, and
VHL gene mutations. The use of tissue microarray technologies for expression profiling of molecules and proteins in tumor specimens has allowed investigators to
screen large numbers of potential molecular prognostic
factors. This method has led to investigations of markers
associated with cell cycle regulation, tumor proliferation
and growth, cellular adhesion, and angiogenesis; however,
relatively few studies have focused on mRCC.
One example of an investigation in mRCC is a study
by Vasselli et al45 of 58 patients in which complementary
Cancer

DNA microarrays were used to identify prognostic subgroups of patients based on global expression patterns in
primary tumors. On the basis of this approach, 2 groups
of patients with significant differences in survival (18.2 vs
5.9 months; P < .05), based on the expression patterns of
45 genes, were identified. In addition, vascular adhesion
molecule 1 was identified as the most predictive marker.
Patients with high levels had significantly better survival
times than those with low levels.
Kim et al46 used a tissue array composed of samples
from 150 mRCC patients with clear cell tumors who
underwent nephrectomy before treatment with immunotherapy to assess with immunohistochemical analysis 8
markers previously reported as associated with the development and progression of cancer. The markers evaluated
included Ki67, p53, gelsolin, vimentin, epithelial cell adhesion molecule, carbonic anhydrase IX (CAIX), CAXII,
and phosphatase and tensin homologue deleted from
chromosome 10 (PTEN). Adjusting for the effects of T
stage, nuclear grade, and ECOG PS, CAIX, p53, PTEN,
and vimentin were all found to be independent prognostic
factors for survival, with high expression levels of CAIX
and PTEN and low levels of p53 and vimentin being associated with improved outcome. Atkins et al47 likewise
found CAIX expression determined by immunohistochemical analysis to be an independent predictor of survival in a study of 66 mRCC patients treated with
interleukin-2. In contrast to these results, Leibovich
et al48 studied CAIX expression in 730 primary tumors
using immunohistochemical analysis; 97% of tumors
expressed CAIX, with the least frequent expression seen in
papillary (23.2%) and chromophobe (4.2%) cancers. In
tumors with low CAIX expression (85% of tumor cells),
the risk of death was increased by 14% (P ¼ .381).
Expression of CAIX was not identified in normal renal parenchyma but was found in gastric mucosa, pancreatobiliary epithelium, and small intestinal crypts. In this study,
81 patients had synchronous metastatic disease. In this
group, 24 of 81 tumors had low CAIX expression, which
was not associated with the risk of death after adjusting
for nuclear grade and ECOG PS. In the future, gene array
studies of treated and untreated patients will be required
to assess the relationship of various genes to outcomes,
such as PFS, disease-free survival, and survival.
The frequency of VHL mutations in sporadic RCC
has been estimated as 60% to 80%. The association of any
2277

Original Article

VHL mutation with outcome has been examined by
several groups.
A recent report by Choueiri et al49 investigated the
frequency of VHL gene mutations and hypermethylation
in 123 patients receiving VEGF-directed therapy (sunitinib, sorafenib, axitinib, bevacizumab). The frequency of
VHL mutations in the primary tumors was 46%, with
17% having hypermethylation of the promoter region.
When overall response rates and median PFS were examined, no significant differences emerged.
Conclusions
A variety of clinical factors have been studied as potential
prognostic factors in mRCC; however, their role as independent predictors of prognosis is difficult to assess. Studies have examined different factors and used variable
definitions, codings have varied, and different patient populations have been investigated. To address this issue, an
international consortium of researchers developed a comprehensive database of approximately 4000 previously
untreated patients who were entered into controlled clinical
trials. The goal of this effort is to define a single, validated
prognostic model for survival in mRCC that is based on
clinical factors.50,51 The results of this study are pending.
In addition to ‘‘classic’’ factors, new molecular-based
technologies are leading to a better understanding of the
underlying biology of RCC and are helping to identify
new prognostic factors. As discussed herein, several
genetic factors appear to be correlated with outcome.
Their value as independent prognostic factors requires
confirmation by examining them in relatively homogeneous groups of patients and in conjunction with the classic
prognostic factors in future studies. Currently, the
MSKCC prognostic model remains the standard.

OPEN DISCUSSION
The questions and discussion below follow from the oral presentation given at the Third Cambridge Conference on Innovations and Challenges in Renal Cancer and do not correspond
directly to the written article, which is a more general review.
Discussion After Dr. Ronald M. Bukowski’s
Presentation.
Michael Atkins: I always thought that the transaminitis and thrombocytosis that you get in kidney cancer
2278

were mediated by cytokines, such as IL-6, which may also
be associated with both immune suppression and more
rapid disease progression. One would wonder whether
there is some sort of mutation or gene expression signature
that leads specifically to IL-6 or such other factors and
whether that is something that could potentially be teased
out through transcriptional profiling or genetic studies.
Dr. Bukowski: The idea would be to use large-scale
expression profiles of tumors to see if you can tease out
those kinds of factors and whether any of them really
come out of the analyses. VEGF is something that you
can measure, so it is something that you can apply.
Robert Figlin: In clear cell cancer, what is the biology that would explain the difference in the circulating
VEGF levels in different groups of patients with the same,
relatively similar genetic abnormalities?
William Kaelin: There are 2 scenarios. One is
where different VEGF levels reflect different tumor burdens; however, another way to have different VEGF levels
is the same tumor burden, but 1 tumor is really pumping
out VEGF and the other tumor is not. There also may be
systemic effects, acute-phase responses, and other cytokine
effects that are indirectly leading to VEGF, which may
not even be tumor derived, but that is speculative.
Dr. Bukowski: But it may not be VEGF alone. Certain other data within the patient population may have to
be taken into context.
Dr. Kaelin: An important biological question is
whether tumors that are VHL null and putting out a lot of
VEGF are going to be intrinsically more sensitive than
tumors that are not. I do not think we know the answer
yet, and maybe we have some evidence that is negative.
Dr. Bukowski: The change in VEGF level was
something that was then looked at as a predictor, but that
does not provide prognostic information.
Dr. Figlin: It is one thing to call something a prognostic factor; it is another thing to call something a predictive factor. We have not yet shown any of this in a
prospective randomized trial to be predictive. These are
hypothesis-generating factors in a predictive way going
forward.
Dr. Bukowski: Certainly, the Memorial Sloan-Kettering prognostic factor model is valid because it works in
prospective trials, but the VEGF issue now is 1 that we
will have to relook at once we have teased it out of these
recent data sets.

Prognostic Factors for RCC Survival/Bukowski

Dr. Atkins: We have multiple different treatment
strategies for this disease, so how can we identify what is
the right initial treatment strategy based on this type of information? The other point is whether we can identify
clinical factors associated with poor prognosis and the biologic or molecular features within the tumor that are responsible for those clinical factors. You are going to get
more ‘‘bang for your buck’’ if you are inhibiting a pathway
that is associated with poor prognosis rather than inhibiting 1 that is associated with good prognosis.
Dr. Bukowski: Are analyses most appropriate in the
postsurgery population, because that is where the molecular data will give us a handle on tumor behavior without
the intervention of a drug?
Christopher Wood: We have found in our proteomics studies that there are really dramatic changes in the
platelet proteome between patients with renal cell carcinoma versus normal patients and also dramatic changes in
patients before nephrectomy versus after nephrectomy. I
would not dismiss some of these acute-phase reactants.
There may be something that is very tumor promoting in
the platelets.
Bernard Escudier: Based on your initial work, what
is the best parameter to monitor in the blood? Is it VEGF,
HIF, IL-5, or another protein?
Dr. Kaelin: We are looking to see if some of
the proteins we detect in conditioned media of VHL-null
carcinoma cells might potentially be biomarkers, but
again we are encountering some of these same issues:
Are you simply monitoring tumor burden or are you
interrogating the molecular biology of that particular
tumor?
Brian Rini: Do you think there are differences in
different types of VHL mutations?
Marston Linehan: A kind interpretation would be
that maybe the VHL wild-type clear cell carcinomas are
engaging the same pathways. The unkind interpretation
would be that VEGF biology is not really linked to the
clinical activity of these agents.
Dr. Rini: Is it possible that different VHL mutations
would differentially affect the pathway and impact
response?
Dr. Linehan: Absolutely. Certain truncating mutations of VHL are far more tumorigenic than many of the
point mutations. We are also starting to find out that
some of these mutations affect HIF and independent
Cancer

May 15, 2009

pathways such as the NFjB pathway, which could potentially be important.
Sabina Signoretti: We have obtained some gene
expression data on VHL wild-type and VHL mutant clear
cell carcinomas. The gene signature of the HIF pathway is
not significantly different between VHL mutant tumors
and most of VHL wild-type tumors. However, we should
explore more carefully whether the levels of activation of
the pathway are different between the 2 groups.
Dr. Figlin: The field has been dominated by assessing the genetic changes occurring in this disease, but we
also have to remember that there are also nongenetic
changes. How does one translate that into the clinic?
Dr. Escudier: VHL disease is probably 1 of the best
models because at least the genotypic abnormality is well
defined.
Dr. Linehan: What we are so struck by is the powerful driver of the genotype: where the mutation is, what
kind of mutation it is, and so on.
Dr. Kaelin: Another issue is that the renal medulla
is 1 of the few tissues in a mammal that is hypoxic at rest.
An intriguing speculation is that these cells are wired
differently because they have to be able to survive in a
hypoxic environment. Some wonder whether this might
somehow be related to the sensitivity of the kidney to cancer development following VHL loss.
Dr. Figlin: If you look at the pathology of renal cell
carcinoma, it clearly looks like it has hypoxic zones even if
it does not.
Dr. Atkins: Yes, but in patients with VHL disease,
there is likely less necrosis in their kidney tumor specimens and less evidence of hypoxia.
Ivan Pedrosa: We have not measured hypoxia in viable tissue for clear cell tumors, but we have looked at tumor
necrosis on MR imaging and what we have found is that
necrosis for clear cell was highly correlated to tumor size.
