Abstract

Author Manuscript

Consistent with the role of microRNAs (miRNAs) in down-regulating gene expression by
reducing translation and/or stability of target mRNAs1, the levels of specific miRNAs are
important for correct embryonic development and have been linked to several forms of cancer2-4.
However, the regulatory mechanisms by which primary miRNAs (pri-miRNAs) are processed first
to precursor miRNAs (pre-miRNAs) and then to mature miRNAs by the multiprotein Drosha and
Dicer complexes5-8, respectively, remain largely unknown. The KH-type splicing regulatory
protein (KSRP) interacts with single strand AU-rich elements (ARE)-containing mRNAs and is a
key mediator of mRNA decay9,10. Here, we show that KSRP also serves as a component of both
Drosha and Dicer complexes and regulates the biogenesis of a subset of miRNAs. KSRP binds
with high affinity to the terminal loop (TL) of the target miRNA precursors and promotes their
maturation. This mechanism is required for specific changes in target mRNA expression that
affects specific biological programs, including proliferation, apoptosis and differentiation. These
findings reveal an unexpected mechanism that links KSRP to the machinery regulating maturation
of a cohort of miRNAs, that, in addition to its role in promoting mRNA decay, independently
serves to integrate specific regulatory programs of protein expression.

We analysed by mass spectroscopy the immunopurified Dicer-containing complex11 and
identified, amongst others, KSRP (Supplementary Fig. 1a), a highly conserved nucleocytoplasmic RNA-binding protein regulating distinct steps of mRNA life (12,13 and
Supplementary Fig. 1b-d). KH domains 3 and 4 of KSRP (KH3-4) are required to promote

ARE-containing labile mRNAs decay9,10. Coimmunoprecipitation revealed that KSRP is an
integral component of the Dicer complex in HeLa cells (Fig. 1a). Upon Dicer knock-down—
induced (Supplementary Fig. 2a) pre-miRNAs upregulation, an anti-KSRP antibody
immunoprecipitated pre-let-7a14 (Fig. 1b). Recombinant KSRP directly interacted with prelet-7a-1, and KH3-4 accounted for the RNA high affinity binding (Supplementary Fig. 3a).
Interestingly, KSRP interacted with the TL of pre-let-7a-1 (TL-let-7a-1) while did not
associate with either single- or double-stranded mature let-7a (Fig. 1c) with KH3-4
accounting for KSRP binding to TL-let-7a-1 (Supplementary Fig. 3b).

Author Manuscript

We titrated the protein with increasing amounts of TL-let-7a-1 and TL-let-7a-1 with
increasing amount of protein while monitoring the binding by NMR and CD, respectively.
KH3-4 binds to TL-let-7a-1 with a 1:1 stoichiometry and ~50 nM Kd (Supplementary Fig.
3c) while single KH3 and KH4 domains bind to TL-let-7a-1 with ~500 nM and ~ 40 μM Kd,
respectively (Supplementary Fig. 3d, e). In contrast to TNFα ARE interaction10, KH3
recognises a specific site in the TL-let-7a-1 and contributes most of the binding affinity in
the KH3-4-RNA interaction, while KH4 plays an auxiliary role. Comparison of the chemical
shift changes undergone by KH3 amide resonances upon RNA binding in the isolated KH3
and within the two-domain KH2-3 and KH3-4 constructs showed that the bound position of
the resonance affected by TL-let-7a-1 binding is the same whether or not KH2 or KH4 are
present (Fig. 1d and Supplementary Fig. 3f). NMR spectra showed that the position of
nearly all of the resonances of the RNA-bound KH3 is the same for the TL-let-7a-1 and the
entire pre-let-7a-1 (Supplementary Fig. 3g).

Author Manuscript

Our recent work indicated that KH3 recognises short G-rich stretches with high specificity
and affinity15. The TL-let-7a-1 presents two GGG triplets, thus supporting the idea that
KH3 docks KSRP on a specific site and that KSRP-prelet-7a-1 recognition takes place using
a very different mode and a considerably higher affinity compared with ARE mRNA
targets10,16. Mutational analysis of TL-let-7a-1 revealed that the 5' GGG triplet accounts
for high affinity binding to KSRP (Fig. 1e).
KSRP knock-down in both HeLa and NIH-3T3 cells (Supplementary Fig. 2b, c) abrogated
the endogenous let-7a-mediated post-transcriptional silencing of a reporter construct
containing six let-7a binding sites (let-7a6XBS) (Fig. 2a). Importantly, KSRP knock-down
inhibited the effect of both transfected pri- and pre-let-7a-1 on let-7a6XBS reporter but left
transfected mature let-7a function unaffected (Fig. 2b and Supplementary Fig. 4a, b).
Control AUF1 knock-down (Supplementary Fig. 2d) had no effect (Fig. 2a, b).

Author Manuscript

Recombinant KSRP increased the processing activity of Dicer (Fig. 2c) while KSRP
immunodepletion from 293T extracts (Supplementary Fig. 2e) removed the pre-let-7a-1
processing activity (Supplementary Fig. 4c) leaving unaffected mature let-7a
(Supplementary Fig. 4d). Finally, immunopurified KSRP-containing complexes specifically
processed pre-let-7a-1 into mature let-7a (Supplementary Fig. 4e-g).
To investigate whether all pre-miRNAs are regulated by KSRP, we performed miRNA
microarray analysis. Transient KSRP knock-down in HeLa cells significantly reduced (>1.5
fold) the expression of 14 miRNAs (Supplementary Fig. 5a) and reduced by 1.2-1.5 fold the

expression of additional 20 miRNAs (Supplementary Table I). Northern blot analysis in both
HeLa and NIH-3T3 cells confirmed that let-7a, miR-26b, miR-20, miR-106a, miR-21, and
miR-16 were reduced by 40-70% upon KSRP knock-down while miR-23b and miR-24 were
unaffected (Fig. 2d; Supplementary Fig. 5b-e, and data not shown). UV-crosslinking and in
vitro processing experiments showed selectivity of KSRP binding and KSRP-induced
processing for those miRNAs whose expression was regulated by KSRP (Supplementary
Fig. 6a-c, and data not shown). Interestingly, the TL-miR-21 does not contain any GGG
triplets but displays two potential nonoptimal binding sites for KSRP KH3 and KH4
(Supplementary Fig. 6d; 15). Mutation of the two G residues in the GUUG 5' element
abrogated KSRP interaction while mutation of the 3' GG doublet only reduced the binding
affinity (Supplementary Fig. 6d).

Author Manuscript

To investigate the function of TL-KSRP interaction, we utilized chimaeric pre-miRNAs
with swapped loop sequences. KSRP knock-down did not affect the expression of a reporter
containing let-7a binding sites when a chimaeric pre-let-7a-1 comprising the TL of miR-23b
was expressed in HeLa cells (Fig. 2e). Conversely, expression of a reporter containing
miR-23b binding sites was impaired by KSRP knock-down in HeLa cells expressing a
chimaeric pre-miR-23b containing the TL of let-7a-1 (Fig. 2f, Supplementary Fig. 6e).

Author Manuscript

Since pre-miRNA accumulation induced by KSRP knock-down was low in comparison to
that induced by Dicer knock-down (Supplementary Fig. 7a) and KSRP knock-down
increased the levels of pri-let-7a-1 and pri-miR-21 (Supplementary Fig. 7b), we
hypothesized an involvement of KSRP in pri-miRNA processing. KSRP
coimmunoprecipitated with Flag-tagged Drosha and DGCR8 (Fig. 3a) and anti-KSRP
antibody immunoprecipitated pri-let-7a-1 and pri-miR-21 but not pri-miR23b, pri-miR-24,
and pri-miR-17 (Fig. 3b and Supplementary Fig. 7c). Endogenous, transfected and
recombinant KSRP specifically interacted with pri-let-7a-1 (Supplementary Fig. 8a-c).
Immunopurified KSRP-containing complexes processed pri-let-7a-1 similarly to Droshacontaining immunopurified complexes (Supplementary Fig. 9a). Either stable or transient
KSRP knock-down in 293T, HeLa, and NIH-3T3 cells reduced the pri-let-7a-1 processing
(Supplementary Fig. 9b-d) leaving unaffected the processing of pri-miR-23b
(Supplementary Fig. 9b right panel and data not shown). Addition of recombinant KSRP to
293T shKSRP extracts restored pri-let-7a-1 processing while KSRP overexpression in 293T
cells strongly increased pri-let-7a-1 processing (Fig. 3c and Supplementary Fig. 9e).

Author Manuscript

We explored the possibility that KSRP favours the association of the enzymatic complexes
with select miRNA precursors. Indeed, KSRP knock-down abrogated the interaction of
Drosha with pri-let-7a-1, and pri-miR-21 (Fig. 3d) and strongly reduced the binding of Dicer
to pre-Let-7a-1 and pre-miR-21 (Fig. 3e). In contrast, KSRP knock-down did not affect the
interaction of the same pri-miRNAs and pre-miRNAs with either DGCR8 or TRBP
(Supplementary Fig. 10a and data not shown)5,11.
KSRP knock-down increased mRNA levels of two let-7 targets, NRAS and MYC (17,18,
Supplementary Fig. 10b), and specificity was established because cotransfection of mature
let-7a abolished this effect (Supplementary Fig. 10c, d). Furthermore, KSRP knock-down in
U2OS osteosarcoma cells reduced the expression of mature let-7a, significantly upregulated

cell proliferation19 (Fig. 4a, and data not shown), and reduced the anti-proliferative effect of
transfected pri-let-7a-1 but not of mature let-7a (Fig. 4a, Supplementary Fig. 11a). Similarly,
KSRP knock-down prevented the pri-miR-16-1—induced apoptosis20 while did not affect
the activity of transfected mature miR-16 (Supplementary Fig. 11b, c). Recently, an
essential role of select miRNAs (miR-1, miR-133a, miR-206) in C2C12 myoblasts
differentiation has been reported21,22. KSRP knock-down in C2C12 reduced the maturation
of “myogenic” miRNAs (Supplementary Fig. 12a-c). KSRP interaction with pri-miR-206,
pri-miR-1-1, and pri-miR-1-2 was increased by pro-differentiative stimuli (DM,
Supplementary Fig. 12d). Finally, KSRP knock-down inhibited the miR-206-induced downregulation of direct target mRNAs, including Connexin 43 and DNA pol α22, impairing
C2C12 differentiation (Supplementary Fig. 12e, f).

Author Manuscript

Recently, four papers8,23-25 demonstrated that the maturation of let-7 is blocked by Lin28
in undifferentiated embryonic stem cells and P19 cells. We observed that KSRP interacts
with pri-Let-7g in P19 cells upon retinoic acid-induced differentiation (Fig. 4b). Lin28
knock-down in undifferentiated P19 cells induced let-7g expression while concomitant
KSRP knock-down abolished this effect (Fig. 4c) suggesting that, upon Lin28 knock-down,
KSRP promotes let-7g precursors maturation. Similarly, upon P19 differentiation, Lin28
expression is abrogated8,23-25 thus allowing KSRP to promote processing of let-7g
precursors. This is also compatible with the recently reported mechanism of action of
Lin2826. We suggest that TL is a pivotal structure where miRNA processing “activators”
(e.g. KSRP) as well as “repressors” (e.g. Lin28) function in a coordinated way to convey
proliferating, apoptotic or differentiating cues into changes of miRNA expression (Fig. 4d).

Author Manuscript

In conclusion, KSRP is a key regulator of the processing of a sizeable subset of miRNA
precursors based on its high affinity binding to their TL. The TLs of the majority of KSRPregulated microRNAs (let-7-a, -b, -c, -d, -f, -i, and miR-196a) contain short G-rich stretches
of at least 3 Gs that represent the optimal binding site for KH315. However, the TLs of the
other KSRP target miRNAs contain instead two sequential or isolated Gs and our data on
KSRPTL-miR-21 interaction show that a significant, albeit different, contribution to the
binding is provided by both Gs motifs (Supplementary Fig. 6d). These data underscore the
adaptability of the protein to a broad range of single-strand RNA sequences15,16.

Author Manuscript

Upon binding, KSRP could optimise the positioning/recruitment of both the miRNA
precursors processing complexes through protein-protein interactions (Supplementary Fig.
13a-c). The RNase sensitivity of KSRP—exportin-5 (Exp5), interaction suggests that KSRP
is associated with the terminal loop of target miRNA precursors during nucleo-cytoplasmic
transit (Supplementary Fig. 13a). Sequential immunoprecipitation experiments indicate that
at least two pools of miRNA precursors exist, one associated with processing complexes
including KSRP and the other associated with processing complexes that do not include
KSRP (Supplementary Fig. 14). For example, Caceres and coworkers27 reported that
hnRNPA1 binds to the TL of miRNAs whose processing is not affected by KSRP.
Altogether, our findings uncover an additional level of complexity for miRNA-dependent
regulation of gene expression that contributes to the modulation of different biological
programs.

METHODS SUMMARY
Ribonucleoprotein complexes immunoprecipitation (RIP)
RIP was performed as previously described by Chen et al28 with minor modifications.
Briefly, cells lysates were immunoprecipitated with either Protein A- or ProteinA/ProteinGSepharose-coupled antibodies at 4° C overnight. Pellets were sequentially washed with the
following buffers: Buffer I (0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mM EDTA, 20 mM Tris-HCl,
pH 8.1, 150 mM NaCl); Buffer II (0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mM EDTA, 20 mM TrisHCl, pH 8.1, 500 mM NaCl); and Buffer III (0.25 M LiCl, 1% NP-40, 1% deoxycholate, 1
mM EDTA, 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.1). Total RNA was prepared using Trizol®,
retrotranscribed using random primers and amplified by PCR. The primer sequences are
detailed in Supplementary Table II.

METHODS
Identification of Dicer-interacting proteins by liquid chromatography tandem mass
spectrometry (LC-MSMS) analysis

Author Manuscript

Anti-Dicer mAbs 33, 73, and 83 and control mAbs11 were crosslinked to Protein G
Sepharose 4 Fast Flow (Amersham Bioscience) and used to purify Dicer complexes from
HEK293T (293T) cytoplasmic extracts (S1011). Coimmunoprecipitates were washed five
times with lysis buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl [pH 7.5], 300 mM NaCl, 0.5% NP-40, 2.5 mM
MgCl2). Proteins were separated by 10% SDS PAGE. Protein containing gel fragments,
were digested with trypsin according to Schrimpf et al29 and analysed by LC-MSMS (LCQ
Deca XP, Thermo 7 Finnigan). Proteins were identified using Turbo Sequest and MASCOT,
searching SwissProt database restricted to human proteins. A protein was considered as
identified, if at least two peptides were in the first rank, concerning the correlation of
experimental with theoretical data, with an ion score greater than 25. Peptides with ion
scores between 20 and 40 were peer reviewed for their quality of alignment. No KSRPspecific peptides were identified in immunoprecipitations with isotype-control mAbs.
NMR and CD spectroscopy

Author Manuscript

All CD spectra were recorded on Jasco J-715 spectropolarimeter (Jasco) equipped with a
PTC-348 Peltier temperature-control system. RNA binding was monitored by adding
increasing amounts of protein to 2 μM TL-let-7a-1 RNA in 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 100
mM NaCl, 0.5 mM TCEP. A temperature of 5 °C was chosen to optimise the signal change
upon protein binding. The integral of the signal between 255 and 265 nm was fitted against
the protein concentration using in house programs previously described30 and the values of
the Kds were extracted. All NMR spectra were recorded on Bruker Avance spectrometers
operating at 600 and 700 MHz 1H frequencies fitted with a supercooled probe. The spectra
were processed with the NMRPipe package31 and analysed with Sparky32. Solutions of 25
μM 15N- labeled samples of KH3, KH4 and KH3-4 in 10 mM Tris-HCl buffer, 50 mM
NaCl, 1 mM TCEP, pH 7.4, were titrated with TL-let-7a-1 RNA oligonucleotides. 15N-1H
HSQC spectra were recorded at each point of the titration at 27 °C. Amide chemical shift
changes as a function of protein/RNA ratio were fitted to obtain the Kd values for the
complexes using in-house software as described by Martin et al30. Weighted average values

(Δδ15N)2/10]1/2 and used to map TL-let-7a-1 binding on a MolMol-generated molecular
surface33.
Preparation of RNA substrates and in vitro processing assays
For pri-miRNAs processing assays, total cell extracts were prepared in 50mM Tris-HCl [pH
8.0], 150 mM NaCl, 0.5% Triton X-100, 1X Complete®, 10% glycerol) from either HeLa or
293T cells and incubated (typically 40 μg per 25 μl reaction at 37° C for the indicated times)
with in-vitro synthesised and uniformly labeled pri-miRNA (5 fmol) in processing buffer
containing 100 mM KCH3COOH, 2 mM Mg (CH3COOH)2, 10 mM Tris-Cl (pH 7.6), 2 mM
DTT, 10 mM creatine phosphate, 1 μg of creatine phosphokinase, 1 mM ATP, 0.4 mM GTP,

KSRP KH3, KH4 and KH3-4 proteins were obtained as previously described10. Briefly,
15N labelled proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3), as His-GST-fusion
protein and initially purified using nickel affinity chromatography according to the
manufacturer instructions. The His-GST fusion tags were then cleaved with TEV protease
and removed using a second nickel affinity step. Proteins were further purified and buffer
exchanged by gel filtration (Superdex 75 16/60 column, Pharmacia). Protein purity (always
>95%) was assessed using SDS-PAGE and Coomassie blue staining. Protein quantification
was achieved by a combination of spectrophotometry using predicted extinction coefficients
and ninhydrin analysis of protein hydrolysates. All RNA oligonucleotides were chemically
synthesized (Dharmacon).

Figure 2. KSRP regulates pre-let-7a-1 processing and controls the expression of select miRNAs

Author Manuscript

a, KSRP knock-down reduces the effect of endogenous let-7a on the activity of pGL3let-7a6XBS. Student's t-test: * p-value < 0.05, ** p-value < 0.01. b, KSRP knock-down
reduces the effect of either prilet-7a-1 or pre-let-7a-1, but not of mature let-7a, on pGL3let-7a6XBS activity. * p-value < 0.05. c, recombinant KSRP increases the processing
activity of recombinant Dicer on pre-let-7a. d, Analysis of total RNA from either control
(siCtrl), KSRP, or Dicer knock-down HeLa cells. e, f, KSRP knock-down does not reduce
the effect of a chimaeric pre-let-7a-1 comprising the TL of miR-23b on the activity of
pGL3-let-7a6XBS (e) while impairing the effect of a chimaeric pre-miR-23b comprising the
TL of pre-let-7a-1 on the activity of pGL3-miR-23b3XBS (f). * p-value < 0.05. All data are
presented as mean ± s.d. (n=4).

Figure 4. KSRP affects let-7-regulated cell proliferation and is involved in Lin28-regulated
maturation of let-7g in P19 cells

Author Manuscript

a, KSRP knock-down increases proliferation while inhibits the antiproliferative effect of
transfected prilet-7a-1 but not of mature let-7a in U2OS cells. * p-value < 0.05, ** p-value <
0.01. b, KSRP interacts with pri-let-7g only in differentiated P19 cells. c, Lin28 knock-down
in undifferentiated P19 cells induces the expression of let-7g. Concomitant Lin28 and KSRP
knock-down abolishes let-7g expression. f, A model for KSRP-dependent regulation of
processing of select miRNA. All data are presented as mean ± s.d. (n=4).
