BACKGROUND: Ipilimumab is a monoclonal antibody that antagonizes cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen-4, a negative regulator of the immune system. The authors report on advanced refractory melanoma patients treated in a compassionate
use trial of ipilimumab at the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center. METHODS: Patients with advanced refractory melanoma were treated in a compassionate use trial with ipilimumab 10 mg/kg every 3 weeks for 4 doses. Those with evidence
of clinical benefit at Week 24 (complete response [CR], partial response [PR], or stable disease [SD]) then received ipilimumab every 12 weeks. RESULTS: A total of 53 patients were enrolled, with 51 evaluable. Grade 3/4 immune-related adverse
events were noted in 29% of patients, with the most common immune-related adverse events being pruritus (43%), rash
(37%), and diarrhea (33%). On the basis of immune-related response criteria, the response rate (CR þ PR) was 12% (95%
confidence interval [CI], 5%-25%), whereas 29% had SD (95% CI, 18%-44%). The median progression-free survival was 2.6
months (95% CI, 2.3-5.2 months), whereas the median overall survival (OS) was 7.2 months (95% CI, 4.0-13.3 months).
Patients with an absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) 1000/lL after 2 ipilimumab treatments (Week 7) had a significantly
improved clinical benefit rate (51% vs 0%; P ¼ .01) and median OS (11.9 vs 1.4 months; P < .001) compared with those with an
ALC <1000/lL. CONCLUSIONS: The results confirm that ipilimumab is clinically active in patients with advanced refractory melanoma. The ALC after 2 ipilimumab treatments appears to correlate with clinical benefit and OS, and

KEYWORDS: ipilimumab, melanoma, lymphocyte, compassionate use, trial.

Melanoma is 1 of several cancers whose incidence has increased in the past several decades.1 In the metastatic setting,

therapy is toxic and relatively ineffective.2-4 Most trials have reported objective responses in <15% of patients, which tend
to be short-lived. In fact, a clear survival benefit for chemotherapy has yet to be demonstrated. The notable exception is
treatment with high-dose interleukin-2 (IL-2), which has a similarly low response rate and serious toxicity but does lead to
durable complete responses in a small subset of patients. As such, more effective therapy is urgently needed.
Cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen-4 (CTLA-4) is a coinhibitory molecule expressed by activated T cells and a subset
of regulatory T cells.5-7 CTLA-4 is of primary importance in maintaining immune homeostasis by down-regulating T-cell
signaling to inhibit the CD28-B7 costimulatory pathway, limiting T-cell responses, and contributing to tolerance to selfantigens.8,9 Therefore, blockade of CTLA-4 is thought to prevent down-regulation of T cells and can potentiate immune
responses against antigens expressed on tumor cells.10-13

Original Article

Ipilimumab is a fully human immunoglobulin G1
monoclonal antibody that blocks CTLA-4. In several
phase 1 and 2 trials, it has been found to produce objective
and durable tumor responses in several tumor types, notably melanoma.14,15 A group of mechanism-based side
effects, termed immune-related adverse events, occur in
patients treated with CTLA-4–blocking antibodies. The
induction of this organ-specific inflammation underscores
the importance of CTLA-4 in restraining the immune system under normal circumstances. The immune-related
adverse events can be controlled using corticosteroids,
according to simple algorithms. Interestingly, the frequency of clinical benefit has been observed to be higher
in patients having immune-related adverse events, and the
use of corticosteroids and other immunosuppressive
medications does not interfere with sustained tumor
immunity.16
In this article, we report on 51 evaluable patients
with advanced melanoma treated in a compassionate use
trial of ipilimumab at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer
Center (MSKCC). These were heavily pretreated patients
who did not qualify for other clinical trials and were
expected to have a poor prognosis. In addition to
communicating a large single-institution experience with
ipilimumab, which largely corroborates findings of multiinstitutional trials, we also propose that the absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) after the first 2 treatments may be a
useful biomarker to identify patients who are unlikely to
benefit from ipilimumab therapy. Given the occurrence
of immune-related adverse events in a significant number
of patients and the sometimes long time interval required
to obtain clinical benefit, a simple biomarker for identification of patients with low chance for benefit represents
an important goal.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Eligibility Criteria
Eligibility criteria included unresectable stage III and IV
melanoma, with all histology confirmed at MSKCC.
Patients had experienced progression of disease (PD) or
intolerance to at least 1 prior systemic therapy (except for
ocular primary tumor patients, who were required to have
local control of their disease), with the last therapy administered 28 days before trial entry (with the exception of
palliative radiotherapy). All patients were 18 years old
and were required to have essentially normal bone marrow
and organ function and an Eastern Cooperative Oncology
Group (ECOG) performance status of 2. Patients with

1768

primary ocular or mucosal melanomas were eligible, as
were those with brain metastases. Exclusion criteria
included prior therapy with ipilimumab or eligibility for
another ongoing trial of ipilimumab. The protocol was
reviewed by the MSKCC Institutional Review Board
(IRB), and all patients gave informed consent. Additional
blood samples were obtained for immune function correlative assays under a separate IRB-approved procurement
protocol.
Treatment Plan
Ipilimumab (MDX-010) was provided by Bristol-Myers
Squibb (Plainsboro, NJ). During the induction phase, it
was administered at 10 mg/kg intravenously over 90
minutes every 3 weeks for 4 doses (on Weeks 1, 4, 7, and
10). Patients completed the induction phase unless they
developed clear clinical deterioration or unacceptable toxicity (refractory grade 3 immune-related adverse event).
After induction ipilimumab, patients were re-evaluated at Weeks 12 and 24. Those without unacceptable
toxicity and with evidence of clinical benefit at Week 24
(defined as complete response [CR] or partial response
[PR] or stable disease [SD]) received maintenance ipilimumab 10 mg/kg every 12 weeks. Patients continued on
therapy until PD, death or unacceptable toxicity occurred.
Patients off therapy continued to be observed until death
or until they were lost to follow-up.
Evaluation at Baseline and During Treatment
Pretreatment evaluations included a complete history and
physical examination, routine laboratory testing, and
imaging of measurable disease. Before each ipilimumab
administration, patients underwent repeat laboratory testing and were monitored for toxicity, which was graded
according to National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (version 3.0).
Patients underwent repeat radiographic imaging at
Weeks 12 and 24 and before each subsequent dose of
maintenance ipilimumab. Because responses to ipilimumab may follow an atypical pattern from cytotoxic
chemotherapy, recently proposed immune-related
(immune-related) response criteria were used for clinical
decision-making.17,18 These criteria represent an amendment to the modified World Health Organization
(WHO) criteria so that the appearance of new lesions
does not automatically constitute PD. Instead, the total
tumor burden is calculated by summation of the product
of the perpendicular diameters of new and previously
measurable lesions. An immune-related CR occurs when

all measurable disease disappears, an immune-related PR
occurs when there has been >50% but <100% decrease
in tumor burden, immune-related SD occurs if there has
been 50% decrease or 25% increase in tumor burden,
and immune-related PD occurs if the tumor burden
increases by >25%.

Statistical Analysis
Any patient who received at least 1 ipilimumab treatment
and had at least 1 follow-up evaluation was eligible for
analysis. As this was a compassionate use trial, there was
no specific target accrual. Univariate analyses of clinical
characteristics and outcomes, including response proportion (CR þ PR) and clinical benefit rate (CR þ PR þ
SD) at Week 24, were assessed using the chi-square test.
Kaplan-Meier survival distributions were estimated to
assess progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival
(OS). The log-rank test was used for comparison of survival distributions.
To determine whether the ALC after the first and
second ipilimumab treatments, respectively, was associated with improved survival, a landmark analysis was performed in which OS was defined as the time from 3 and 6
weeks, respectively, after treatment start (approximately
the time of each post-treatment complete blood count
[CBC]) to the date of death or last follow-up. This was
done to correct for patients who died before they underwent repeat CBC measurements.19 A Cox proportional
hazards model was fit to adjust for baseline lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels when further examining the association of ALC on OS.

RESULTS
Demographics
From October 2007 through September 2008, 53
patients have been enrolled. Two patients are unevaluable;
1 patient was lost to follow-up after receiving 1 dose of
ipilimumab, whereas the other patient received chemotherapy between ipilimumab doses. Patient demographics
are summarized in Table 1.
The median age of patients was 62 years (range, 3886 years). Approximately 64% were men, and 85% had
an ECOG status of 0 to 1. Patients had relatively
advanced disease as assessed by baseline LDH; 32% had a
baseline LDH >2 the upper limit of normal.
Most patients were heavily pretreated; the median
number of prior systemic therapies was 2 (range, 0-6
therapies). Approximately 93% had received prior cyto-

regimens), and 43% had also received therapy with investigational agents, such as small molecule inhibitors (eg,

respectively, of patients had received adjuvant interferon-a
and high-dose IL-2 in the metastatic setting, whereas 7%
had received prior vaccine therapy in either the adjuvant
or metastatic setting.
Toxicity
There were no treatment-related deaths, although 8 of 51
(16%) evaluable patients died within 30 days of their last
dose of ipilimumab. Toxicities seen on this trial were
largely consistent with the known toxicities of anti–
CTLA-4 therapies in a population with advanced cancer.

a
Toxicities were graded according to National Cancer Institute Common
Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (version 3.0).

4 toxicities noted in >20% of patients are listed in
Table 2.
Treatment-related grade 3 to 4 hematologic toxicity
was noted only in 1 patient (2%), a 47-year-old man who
had previously developed pancytopenia on temozolomide
therapy, considered an idiosyncratic reaction. After receiving the third dose of ipilimumab, he developed grade 4
neutropenia and thrombocytopenia and grade 2 anemia.
Bone marrow biopsy revealed a hypercellular marrow
with an infiltrate of lymphocytes and plasma cells, along
with granuloma formation. He received filgrastim, intravenous methylprednisolone, intravenous immunoglobulin, infliximab, and finally cyclosporine. His blood counts
eventually recovered but, presumably because of the 4week period of neutropenia and immunosuppression
therapy, he subsequently developed Fournier gangrene,
requiring extensive surgical debridement. Fortunately, he
has since recovered from all toxicities.
In terms of nonhematologic toxicities, a constellation of immune-related adverse events related to the inhibition of negative regulation by CTLA-4 was observed.
The most common immune-related adverse events were

1770

grade 1 to 2 pruritus in 22 (43%) patients and rash in 19
(37%, 1 grade 3) patients. Diarrhea was noted in 17
(33%) patients, with 8 (16%) patients experiencing grade
3 diarrhea. Five (10%) of these patients were also found to
have colitis by colonoscopy. Other serious immunerelated adverse events included grade 3 to 4 aspartate aminotransferase/alanine aminotransferase elevation secondary to noninfectious hepatitis in 4 (8%) patients, adrenal
insufficiency in 2 patients (4%, 1 grade 2 with evidence of
hypophysitis on magnetic resonance imaging and 1 grade
3) patients, grade 2 conjunctivitis in 2 patients, and grade
4 lipase elevation secondary to pancreatitis in 1 patient.
One patient developed grade 2 hypothyroidism without
other evidence of endocrine dysfunction that may have
been treatment related.
Overall, 15 of 51 (29%) patients developed 1 or
more grade 3 to 4 immune-related adverse events. Seven
(14%) patients discontinued therapy because of immunerelated adverse events.
Clinical Responses
On the basis of the immune-related response criteria, we
noted a pattern of response that was atypical for that of cytotoxic chemotherapy. One (2%) patient experienced an
immune-related PD before experiencing immune-related
SD. Twelve (24%) patients experienced prolonged
immune-related SD as their best response, with a median
time to progression of 8.4 months.
The objective response rate (RR) was 12% (4
immune-related CRs and 2 immune-related PRs; 95%
confidence interval [CI], 5%-25%). Of the patients with
immune-related CRs, 1 patient had completed radiation
therapy just before study entry and experienced a CR after
ipilimumab therapy in lesions that were within and outside of the radiation field. Another patient underwent
resection of the only site of residual metastatic disease after
experiencing a CR at other metastatic sites and has since
maintained a CR. A third patient (who experienced grade
4 hematologic toxicity as described above) underwent
resection of pelvic lymph nodes that comprised the only
site of residual metastatic disease (at the time of a colostomy reversal) and was found to have achieved a pathologic CR. Characteristics of these patients are presented in
Table 3; representative radiographic images of a patient
with a CR are shown in Figure 1.
Fifteen (29%; 95% CI, 18%-44%) patients experienced immune-related SD as their best response, whereas
the remaining 30 patients (59%) experienced immunerelated PD/death. As the decision to continue maintenance

ipilimumab was based on an assessment at Week 24, we
also calculated the clinical benefit rate at Week 24, which
was 33% (95% CI, 21%-48%).
Although patients with and without high-grade
immune-related adverse events experienced objective
response, there appeared to be a correlation between the
development of grade 3 to 4 immune-related adverse
events and clinical response. Patients with grade 3 to 4
immune-related adverse events had a significantly higher
clinical benefit rate at Week 24 (9 of 15 [60%] patients vs
8 of 36 [22%] patients; P < .01) compared with those
with grade 2 immune-related adverse events. There was
also a borderline significant trend toward an increased
objective RR in patients with grade 3 to 4 immune-related
adverse events (4 of 15 [27%] vs 2 of 36 [6%]; P < .05).
Survival
The median PFS of all 51 patients was 2.6 months (95%
CI, 2.3-5.2 months). The median OS was 7.2 months
(95% CI, 4.0-13.3 months). There were no significant
differences in OS when patients were stratified by known
prognostic factors in melanoma: baseline LDH, number
of prior systemic therapies, and cutaneous versus mucosal/ocular primary tumors.
Biomarker Evaluation: ALC
We sought to correlate ALC at different early time points
with the rate of clinical benefit at Week 24 and OS. ALC
values at different time points are shown in Figure 2. We
stratified patients based on a cutoff of 1000/lL (high
ALC) versus <1000 cells/lL (low ALC). Kaplan-Meier survival curves based on the ALCs at baseline and after 1 and 2
ipilimumab doses, respectively, are shown in Figure 3.
When patients were stratified based on their baseline
ALC, there was a nonsignificant trend toward an
increased rate of clinical benefit at Week 24 for patients

Cancer

with a high versus low ALC (10 of 21 [48%] patients vs 7
of 30 [23%]; P ¼ .07). There was also a borderline significant trend toward improved OS for the high ALC group
(median OS, 13.3 months vs 5.1 months; P ¼ .06). This
trend remained after adjusting for baseline LDH (P ¼
.06). The 6-month and 12-month OS were 76% versus
43% and 53% versus 25%, respectively, when stratified
by high versus low ALC (Fig. 3A).
When patients were stratified by their ALC after 1
ipilimumab dose (obtained 3 weeks later on the day of
their planned second ipilimumab dose), there was a nonsignificant trend toward increased clinical benefit at Week
24 for high versus low ALC patients (16 of 39 [41%]
patients vs 1 of 10 [10%]; P ¼ .07). Patients with a high
ALC after 1 ipilimumab dose did have significantly
improved OS (median OS, 7.9 months vs 1.8 months; P
< .01). This trend remained after adjusting for baseline
LDH (P < .01). The 6-month and 12-month OS were
66% versus 10% and 44% versus 10%, respectively, by
high versus low ALC (Fig. 3B).
Finally, we stratified patients by their ALC after 2
ipilimumab doses (obtained 3 weeks later on the day of
their planned third ipilimumab dose). Patients with a
high ALC had a significantly higher clinical benefit rate at
Week 24 compared with those with a low ALC (17 of 33
patients [51%] vs 0 of 8; P < .01) as well as improved OS
(median OS, 11.9 months vs 1.4 months; P < .0001).
This trend remained after adjusting for baseline LDH (P
< .0001). The 6-month and 12-month OS rates were
75% versus 0% and 47% versus 0%, respectively, by high
versus low ALC (Fig. 3C).

our objective RR of 12% (as adjudicated by the proposed
immune-related response criteria) is very comparable to
the objective RRs of 5.8% to 15.8% adjudicated by standard modified WHO criteria that are reported in other
phase 2 trials. These trials also reported CR þ PR þ SD
rates of 27.1% to 35.1%, similar to our immune-related
CR þ immune-related PR þ immune-related SD rate of
41%. Finally, grade 3 to 4 immune-related adverse events
were noted in 20% to 38.6% of patients in these trials,
consistent with the rate of 29% we describe here.

CTLA-4 antibody, were recently published.23 This trial
reported an objective RR of 9% by Response Evaluation
Criteria in Solid Tumors criteria, a CR þ PR þ SD rate
of 39% to 41%, and a grade 3 to 4 toxicity rate of 13% to
27%. Median time to progression was about 1.9 months,
with median OS of 9.97 to 11.53 months. With the
exception of the longer OS reported in this trial, which
was likely because of the enrollment of only treatment-naive patients with relatively low LDH, and despite the caveats of comparing different phase 2 trials, these results are
otherwise strikingly similar to ours. Certainly, the median
OS of 7.2 months that we report in our heavily pretreated
patients also compares favorably to standard first-line
therapies for melanoma, such as temozolomide or
dacarbazine.24
In this study, results were reported according to
immune-related response criteria because these were used
for clinical decision making. When we also evaluated
responses using traditional modified WHO criteria, we
noted strong agreement between both criteria. As might
be expected, the only discrepancies occurred when 2
patients who were adjudicated to have immune-related
SD would have experienced PD by the modified WHO
criteria because of the development of new metastatic
lesions (which increased the total tumor burden used in
the immune-related criteria by <25%). As such, there was
no change in the objective RR or best response rate of SD
or PD. There was a slight difference in the Week 24 CR þ
PR þ SD rate of 30% (15 of 51 patients) versus the Week
24 immune-related CR þ immune-related PR þ
immune-related SD rate of 33% (17 of 51 patients), as
well as a small change in the median PFS by modified
WHO versus immune-related criteria (2.5 vs 2.6 months,
respectively).
Our results suggest that patients who develop grade
3 to 4 immune-related adverse events are more likely to
experience clinical benefit at Week 24 compared with
those with no or mild immune-mediated toxicity. These
results are consistent with prior reports25-27 and are also
biologically consistent with the belief that CTLA-4 blockade acts in a nonspecific fashion to de-repress the immune
system, resulting in the frequent but not absolute cooccurrence of antitumor effect and autoimmune-like toxicity. Of note, the median number of ipilimumab treatments that patients with grade 3 to 4 immune-related
adverse events received (which was 4) was identical to the
median number of treatments patients with grade 2
immune-related adverse events received. The comparable
duration of therapy suggests that the increased grade 3 to

1773

Original Article

4 immune-related adverse event rate in patients with clinical benefit was not likely to be because of increased exposure to ipilimumab.
Remarkably, our analysis shows that the ALC correlates strongly both with clinical benefit and OS. The
ALCs obtained at baseline and after 1 ipilimumab treatment appear to be prognostic, but these early ALCs may
be more of a reflection of the extent of prior therapy and
tumor burden. However, the suggestion that a low baseline ALC may be associated with poorer OS does have
implications for the sequencing of therapy in future trials
that combine ipilimumab with chemotherapy.
The ALC obtained after the second ipilimumab
dose appears to be a particularly informative biomarker.
None of 8 patients with an ALC <1000 cells/lL experienced clinical benefit at Week 24; these patients also had
statistically and clinically significantly inferior OS compared with patients with an ALC 1000 cells/lL. There
was a difference in objective RR between both groups
(18% vs 0%), but this was not statistically significant (P ¼
.33), possibly because of the small number of objective
responses that were noted in this trial.
The relatively small number of patients in this trial
precluded us from performing a detailed multivariate
analysis, although the ALC remained a significant prognostic marker when we controlled for baseline LDH.
Nevertheless, the observation that other prognostic factors
(number of prior therapies and the primary site of the tumor) were not correlated with OS suggests that the ALC
does represent an independent biomarker.
There is a strong biological rationale that the ALC
value is correlated with benefit from ipilimumab because
it directly blocks CTLA-4 expressed on various lymphocyte populations. Presumably, a threshold ALC of 1000
cells/lL reflects the underlying capacity of the immune
system to be adequately activated by ipilimumab to mediate clinically meaningful antitumor effects. Our observation also complements recent data indicating that the rate
of change of ALC with ipilimumab therapy is positively
associated with the CR þ PR þ SD rate.28 In particular,
the observation from this larger data set that patients
whose ALCs drop after initiation of ipilimumab have a
0% CR þ PR þ SD rate is consistent with our observation that a minimum ALC level may be required for
patients to derive clinical benefit from ipilimumab.
Overall, these data have strong implications for clinical practice, as they suggest that the approximately 20%
of patients with an ALC <1000 cells/lL will not benefit
from additional ipilimumab therapy. Such patients could

1774

be spared the potential toxicity of further therapy and
could be switched to an alternative treatment plan.
In conclusion, this report of patients with advanced
melanoma treated at MSKCC in a trial of compassionate
use ipilimumab is consistent with other phase 2 evaluations of anti–CTLA-4 antibodies. Furthermore, our
results suggest a single ALC measurement obtained after 2
ipilimumab treatments is strongly predictive of clinical
response to ipilimumab. A larger retrospective multivariate review and prospective validation of this biomarker are
to be strongly considered, as they have the potential to
identify patients who are unlikely to benefit from ipilimumab therapy, while benefiting those who are likely to
benefit.
