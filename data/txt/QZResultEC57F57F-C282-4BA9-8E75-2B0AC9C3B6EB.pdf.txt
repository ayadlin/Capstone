BACKGROUND: Treating the octogenarian and nonagenarian patients who have acute myeloid leukemia
(AML) with intensive chemotherapy is controversial. Several models to predict outcome were proposed,
including the use of a comorbidity index. However, it is unclear whether the Charlson comorbidity index
(CCI) or the hematopoietic cell transplant comorbidity index (HCTCI) is more sensitive. METHODS: The
authors analyzed their experience with 92 patients aged 80 years who had AML. Patients’ pretreatment
characteristics and their treatment outcomes were recorded. RESULTS: All patients were offered intensive
treatment; 59 patients (64%) were treated intensively with a variety of regimens, whereas 33 patients
(36%) elected to receive supportive care. The CCI and the HCTCI had similar predictive ability for outcome
in both groups. A multivariate analyses of prognostic factors identified near-normal albumin (48% of
patients; 1-year survival rate, >27%) as a favorable factor for the whole cohort, age <83 years (47% of
patients; 1-year survival rate, >25%) and nonmonocytic morphology (75% of patients; 1-year survival rate,
>26%) as favorable factors for the intensively treated cohort, and bone marrow blasts <46% (50%
of patients; 1-year survival rate, >19%) as a favorable factor for patients who received supportive care.
CONCLUSIONS: This retrospective analysis was developed to assist in treatment decisions for octogenarian
and nonagenarian patients with AML. The findings will need validation in a prospective study. Cancer

Prognostic Model for 80 AML/Harb et al

The treatment of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in

patients aged 60 years is controversial, and the majority
of these patients probably do not undergo intensive treatment.1-4 A recent systematic review of the literature of
large population-based investigations analyzed clinical trials that included >40 patients.3 In a total of 36 AML trials that involved 12,370 patients with a median age of 70
years, the median overall survival (OS) approached 30
weeks for intensively treated patients, whereas the median
survival for patients who received best supportive care
alone or best supportive care and nonintensive therapy
was 7.5 weeks and 12 weeks, respectively. The complete
remission (CR) rate after induction therapy was 44%;
and, for the patients who achieved a CR, age no longer
influenced prognosis.3 We were interested specifically in a
subset of elderly patients with AML, those aged 80
years, because we have a significant number of these
patients; and, to the best of our knowledge, very few
articles have concentrated specifically on this age group.
Four different groups have addressed treatment outcomes of patients aged 80 years with AML.5-8 In those
reports, the CR rate after induction ranged between 20%
and 37%; however, only a few patients survived beyond 1
year. Each of the 4 groups attempted to define the precise
risk factors that could be used as prognostic tools to identify the subgroup of patients who would benefit from
induction regimens and those who should be offered supportive care. Whereas Mori and colleagues7 emphasized
the importance of karyotype as a risk factor, Wahlin and
colleagues6 assigned risk groups based on karyotype, the
presence of an antecedent hematologic disorder, and leukocytosis. DeLima and colleagues5 observed that poor
performance status and low albumin were significant risk
factors in very elderly patients with AML. However, a
more recent analysis from the same group8 in a larger
cohort of patients revealed that karyotype, performance
status, antecedent hematologic disorder, and the use of
laminar air-flow rooms all were important prognostic factors. Those studies included between 24 and 82 patients
with AML aged 80 years, and none of assessed the role
of comorbidities on the outcome of these elderly patients.
Comorbid illness was defined in the 1960s by Feinstein9 as a distinct additional clinical entity that has
existed or may occur during the clinical course of a patient
with a primary disease. Specifically in cancer, comorbid
illnesses have led to minimal enrollment of cancer patients

onto clinical trials and often have led to substandard treatment. The Charlson comorbidity index (CCI) was developed in 198710 and was validated in many types of
cancers. It takes into consideration 19 medical conditions
and assigns a different weight to each. The total score is
between 0 and 4: The higher the score, the worse the outcome.11 It recently was demonstrated that the CCI is an
independent predictor of CR in patients with AML aged
70 years.12 The hematopoietic cell transplantation
comorbidity index (HCTCI) was developed by Sorror
and colleagues13 to predict the outcome of patients who
undergo blood and bone marrow transplantation; it is an
adapted and more developed version of the CCI with a
score from 0 to 11. The HCTCI recently was used to
assess patients with AML aged 60 years.14,15 Whereas 1
study14 indicated that the HCTCI was predictive of early
death and event-free survival (EFS), the other study15 did
not. It is noteworthy that no comparison was done
between the 2 scoring systems (CCI and HCTCI) in
patients with AML.
Patients aged 80 years are a precarious group of
patients, because they are beyond the life expectancy in
the United States (77.8 years).16 There is a clear need to
help clinicians and other healthcare providers decide
when to offer intensive approaches and when to refer
patients to supportive care and/or hospice.17 Therefore,
for the current study, we analyzed our institutional experience with these patients to define their prognosis based on
pretreatment factors.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patient Characteristics
Adults who had a diagnosis of AML at aged 80 years
were evaluated at the Roswell Park Cancer Institute
between 1991 and 2007. Patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia were excluded from this analysis. We
recorded patients’ age, sex, performance status, albumin,
lactic dehydrogenase level, white blood cell count, morphology (monocytic [including myelomonocytic, monoblastic, and monocytic] vs nonmonocytic), including the
presence of extramedullary disease, bone marrow and peripheral blood blast percentages, CD34 and CD56 positivity of leukemic blasts, karyotype (either favorable and

curve20 was computed for a variety of survival-based outcomes (eg, 3-month survival). The ROC curve is constructed through calculation of the sensitivity and
specificity associated with all possible cutoffs of the individual test scores. The area under the ROC curve (AUC)
is a measure of the predictive power of a given variable
and, thus, is a measure of the diagnostic accuracy of each
test in terms of predictability of outcome. The 2 AUCs
were derived from the same set of patient data; therefore,
the measures themselves are correlated, so that testing was
based on the use of bootstrap methodology, which incorporated this information. The bootstrapping algorithm
involved resampling of the sample pairs. A nominal significance level of .05 was used. The estimated OS distributions were obtained using the Kaplan-Meier method for
binary variables. By using this distributional estimate,
summary descriptive statistics, such as the median survival, were obtained. Statistical assessment of observed differences in the survival distributions of different groups of
interest was done using the log-rank test. Cox proportional hazards models were used to assess the effect of
study variables on OS in both univariate and multivariate
analyses.

Response Criteria

RESULTS

Hematologic CR was defined according to previously
established criteria.19 OS was defined as the interval
between the day of diagnosis for supportively treated
patients or the first day of treatment for intensively treated
patients and death. Patients were censored at the date they
were last seen alive. Disease recurrence after CR was
defined by the appearance of peripheral blood blasts,
>5% leukemic cells in bone marrow aspirates, or the development of extramedullary leukemia.

In total, 92 patients were analyzed. All patients were
offered intensive treatment without waiting for karyotype
analysis, and treatment decisions were made within 24 to
48 hours from diagnosis. Fifty-nine patients (64%) were
treated intensively on a variety of regimens (Table 1), and
33 patients (36%) elected to receive supportive care. The
patients’ characteristics are described in Table 2; except
for age and karyotype, the characteristics were similar
between the 2 groups. Extramedullary disease was identified in 5 patients (2 patients had central nervous system
involvement of extramedullary disease, and 3 patients had
extramedullary disease at other sites); only 2 of these
patients had monocytic morphology. Their response to
treatment and OS are shown in Table 3. Because patients
were evaluated after 1991, we compared the outcome by
time (both dichotomous and continuous). There was no
statistical difference in outcome according to the time of
patient accrual among the whole cohort, those who
received intensive treatment, and those who received supportive treatment (P ¼ .2140, P ¼ .2623, and P ¼ .8369,

Statistical Analyses
Descriptive statistics, such as frequencies and relative frequencies, were computed for all categorical variables.
Numeric variables were summarized using simple descriptive statistics, such as the mean, median, standard deviation, range, etc. The medians were used as cutoffs for
analyses. A variety of graphic techniques also was used to
display data. To compare the CCI and the HCTCI, the

respectively). There also was no significant difference
between intensively and supportively treated patients with
regard to OS (Fig. 1A), although patients who achieved
CR had a longer survival (median survival, 39.5 weeks)
than patients who did not (median survival, 9.3 weeks)

ROC curves were constructed for both the CCI and
the HCTCI to examine the sensitivity and specificity of
the comorbidity index scores in the prediction of 3-month
survival (Fig. 2). The AUCs (0.564 for the CCI and 0.501
for the HCTCI) did not differ statistically (P ¼ .35). Both
comorbidity indexes had poor diagnostic accuracy.

This retrospective analysis of octogenarian and nonagenarian patients with AML represents our attempt to
define the pretreatment characteristics that will predict
who will benefit from treatment. It is noteworthy that, in
our analyses, we detected 4 different prognostic variables:
albumin for the whole cohort, age and nonmonocytic
morphology in the intensively treated patients, and bone
marrow blast count in the supportively treated patients.
This study could be criticized for the relatively small
number of patients; however, to the best of our knowledge, this is the largest single-institution cohort of patients
with AML aged 80 years. The importance of a singleinstitution approach should be underscored here, because
all patients were offered a uniform treatment approach by
a relatively small group of physicians and were cared for
by the same mid-level practitioners, nurses, social worker,
case manager, and psychologist.
The current study also may be censured for the long
period of accrual (16 years). However, because AML

treatment has not changed significantly in the last 2 decades,21 and because we did not detect any difference in outcome by time-to-accrual to this retrospective analysis, we
believe that the time period does not impact this analysis.
The age difference between the intensively treated
and supportively treated patients is intriguing. It may represent patient and/or physician choice. It is possible that
the ‘‘younger’’ octogenarians preferred intensive treatment. Similarly, attitude disparities among us, the physi-

cians, and our support staff unknowingly may have
affected decision making when we discussed treatment
options with the ‘‘older’’ octogenarians and nonagenarians.22 Such quibbles also were raised at the other end of
the age spectrum with regard to treating young adults
with acute lymphoblastic leukemia.23 Prospectively analyzing patient and physician attitudes may help answer
questions about the role of the patient versus the physician
in decision making about treatment assignment.
The difference in karyotype between the intensively
and supportively treated patients was unexpected, especially because we did not wait for cytogenetic results
before offering treatment to our patients. We propose to
evaluate this question prospectively.
Our results about similar outcomes between intensively and supportively treated patients differ from the
results reported by other groups. Specifically, in the study
by Lowenberg et al,24 randomizing patients between intensive induction therapy and supportive care demonstrated a significantly longer survival duration for the
intensively treated patients. However, the median age in
that study was 72 years, and the cohort included only a
dearth of patients 80 years old. Similarly, in 3

retrospective studies,25-27 longer survival was reported for
intensively treated patients compared with supportively
treated patients, although all of those studies included
only a few patients aged 75 years. Conversely, our
results are in line with 3 other retrospective studies,28-30
which demonstrated only a marginal, if any, advantage in
OS for intensively treated patients. Finally, our study
included the largest number octogenarian and nonagenarian patients.
Performance status was a predictor of outcome in
most studies of patients with AML aged 60 years,1,8,31
but not in all such studies.24 Because most studies concentrated on sexagenarians and older patients, the role of performance status in the patients with AML aged 80 years
will need to be evaluated prospectively.
It was somewhat disappointing to realize that neither the CCI nor the HCTCI had any predictive value in
this patient population despite the finding that 24% of
patients had a CCI of 0 (8% had a HCTCI of 0).
Although 1 group of investigators reported that the CCI
was predictive of CR,12 the HCTCI was described as predictive of early death and EFS by 1 group,14 but not by
another group.15 None of those studies concentrated on
the patients aged 80 years. The scoring variability
between the CCI and the HCTCI is inherent within the
different systems. Both systems were developed for other
purposes; thus, the lack of predictability suggests that a
new system for analyzing the role of comorbidities in this
age group needs to be devised.
Several groups of investigators have demonstrated
that karyotype has prognostic significance in patients with
AML aged 80 years.6-8 One possibility for the discrepancy between our results and others may be the system
used to define intermediate versus unfavorable karyotype
cohorts. We used the Cancer and Leukemia Group B system,18 and we also separated the patients into 2 groups:
favorable and normal karyotype versus all others (data not
shown). Neither method resulted in a significant value to
predict outcome. Thus, the finding that karyotype lacked
predictability power here may reflect the relatively smaller
size of the intensively treated cohort compared with the
other groups.
Three of the outcome predictors, albumin, age, and
bone marrow blast count, were identified previously as
statistically significant in elderly patients with AML. Albumin had prognostic value in elderly patients with AML

according to at least 1 additional group.5 Its role in predicting outcome may be related to its relation to the
patients’ nutritional status and their hepatic function. It is
noteworthy that albumin was an outcome predictor in
several other malignancies.32,33 Age is a well known prognostic factor in all patients with AML and specifically in
the elderly.8 Similarly, at least 1 group of investigators
observed that bone marrow blasts had prognostic significance in elderly patients with AML.34 The percentage of
bone marrow blasts may reflect disease activity; patients
with higher blast counts may have more aggressive disease.
Finally, our data demonstrate that patients with nonmonocytic morphology had a better outcome among the
intensively treated patients. It also worth noting that, in
contrast to previous published data,35,36 extramedullary
disease was less common in the patients who had monocytic morphology in this age group. If the current results
can be reproduced in wider patient cohorts in a prospective manner, then these 4 variables may be helpful in
assigning treatments to patients aged 80 years with
AML.
Recently, it was demonstrated that low-dose cytarabine was beneficial for supportively treated patients.37
None of our patients received this treatment modality.
Furthermore, the new term, ‘‘unfit for intensive treatment,’’ was not coined until recently.8 This term describes
those patients with an 8-week mortality that exceeds 50%.
It includes not only induction death/treatment toxicity but
also lack of efficacy of a particular approach. Our current
model, if confirmed prospectively, could identify octogenarian and nonagenarian patients with normal albumin
levels and nonmonocytic morphology as those who may
be ‘‘fit for chemotherapy’’ despite their advanced age.
The question remains which treatment to offer
patients with AML aged 80 years who are fit for chemotherapy. Several new drugs are currently in development,
eg, clofarabine, cloretazine, decitabine, and arsenic trioxide. Their role will be determined in the next few years,
when the clinical trials will be completed. In the interim,
we recommend enrolling all octogenarian and nonagenarian patients with AML onto clinical trials.
In summary, this retrospective study defined prognostic groups among intensively treated and supportively
treated octogenarian and nonagenarian patients with
AML. If the results are confirmed in prospective studies,
then physicians, allied care support staff, and patients
