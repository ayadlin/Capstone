Abstract
Interleukin-13 (IL-13) receptor A2 (IL-13RA2), a high-affinity
IL-13 binding subunit and a tumor antigen, is amplified
in a variety of human tumor cell lines and tumors in vivo.
By cDNA microarray, we have shown that gene transfer of
human and rat adrenomedullin (AM) up-regulates IL-13RA2
in a human prostate tumor cell line. Here, we show that
IL-13RA2 mRNA and protein are also up-regulated in PC-3
prostate tumor cells by recombinant AM (rAM) and human
synthetic AM peptide in a dose-dependent manner in vitro
and in vivo in mouse prostate tumor model. The 8- to 10-fold
up-regulation of IL-13RA2 by rAM or AM peptide in prostate tumor cells in vitro and in vivo increased their sensitivity to IL-13PE cytotoxin consisting of IL-13 and a truncated
form of Pseudomonas exotoxin. Immunodeficient mice with
established prostate tumors transfected with AM or treated
with AM peptide showed reduction in tumor size by intratumoral administration of IL-13PE in a dose-dependent manner. At the highest dose (three 100 Mg/kg/d every alternate
day), >70% reduction of tumor size was observed compared with controls (P V 0.01). These results indicate that
two completely unrelated hormones (AM and IL-13) are
closely related to each other and that we have identified a
novel role of AM in sensitizing certain types of prostate
tumors to IL-13R–directed therapeutic agent. [Cancer Res

Introduction
Interleukin-13 (IL-13) is a pleiotropic immune regulatory cytokine and the receptors for this cytokine are overexpressed on a
variety of human cancer cell lines and primary tumors derived
from renal cell carcinoma, malignant glioma, ovarian carcinoma,
acquired immunodeficiency syndrome–associated Kaposi’s sarcoma, and head and neck tumors (1–7). IL-13 receptors (IL-13R) are
composed of two prominent proteins termed IL-13Ra1 (also
known as IL-13Ra¶) and IL-13Ra2 (also known as IL-13Ra; refs. 8,
9). IL-13 binds to IL-13Ra1 chain with low affinity, whereas it binds
to IL-13Ra2 chain with high affinity. After binding to IL-13Ra1

chain, IL-13 recruits the predominant IL-4 binding protein (IL-4Ra)
for signaling (1, 2, 9–11). IL-13Ra2 chain was shown to neither recruit any chain nor mediate signal transduction (12, 13).
However, this chain is internalized after binding to ligand (10).
Recent studies have shown that IL-13Ra2 mediates signaling
through activator protein-1 pathway in murine macrophage cell
line (14).
To target IL-13Rs, recombinant fusion proteins composed of
IL-13 and a truncated form of a bacterial toxin, Pseudomonas
exotoxin (IL-13PE38QQR and IL-13PE38), have been developed
(15, 16). This immunotoxin is highly cytotoxic to tumor cells that
express high levels of this receptor (5, 15, 17–21). Based on these
studies, four phase I/II clinical trials were completed to determine
the safety and tolerability of this agent in patients with recurrent
glioblastoma multiforme (22).
Previous studies have shown the potential role of adrenomedullin (AM) in prostate carcinoma by generating a stably
transfected human prostate carcinoma PC-3 cell line (23). AM, a
potent hypotensive 52–amino acid amidated peptide, is a pluripotent factor isolated from renal pheochromocytoma tumors (24).
Later studies identified the presence of AM in both human- and
rat-derived prostate tissues, prostate carcinoma, and prostate
cancer cell lines (25). AM is a tumor promotion factor (26, 27) and
causes vasodilatation and bronchodilation, control hormone
secretion, and renal homeostasis and regulates cell growth in cells
derived from benign and malignant tumors (26, 28, 29).
To study the molecular mechanism of growth control in human
prostate carcinoma by AM, we did cDNA microarray analysis of a
PC-3 cell line transfected with AM. We identified f100 genes that
were up-regulated and involved in regulating cell cycle arrest,
apoptosis, cytoskeleton, cell adhesion, the extracellular matrix,
immune function, and transcription (30). Interestingly, we observed
that IL-13Ra2 mRNA and protein were highly up-regulated (4- to
25-fold) as a result of AM gene transfer. However, the mechanism
through which IL-13a2 is up-regulated is not known. It is also not
known whether AM could up-regulate IL-13Ra2 in vivo and
sensitize tumor to IL-13PE immunotoxin. It will be equally
of interest to know if a synthetic peptide for AM could up-regulate
IL-13Ra2 chain in vitro and in vitro.
In the present study, we have investigated the effect of purified
recombinant AM (rAM), synthetic AM peptide, or gene transfection
of AM on IL-13Ra2 in prostate cancer cells in vitro and in vivo in a
mouse model. The biological function of up-regulated IL-13Ra2
protein was examined in a xenograft model of human prostate cancer. AM gene–transfected prostate carcinoma cells formed tumors
in athymic nude mice, which were subsequently treated with
IL-13PE immunotoxin, and the tumor growth was measured.
A dramatic decrease in tumor size was observed.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture and reagents. PC-3 prostate cancer cell line was purchased from the American Type Culture Collection and maintained in
RPMI 1640 containing 10% fetal bovine serum (Biowhittaker), 1 mmol/L
HEPES, 1 mmol/L nonessential amino acids, 100 units/mL penicillin, and
100 Ag/mL streptomycin (Biowhittaker).
rAM and AM peptide. rAM was expressed from a clone of the PC-3
cell line after stable transfection of full-length AM (see Supplementary
Materials and Methods for details). Synthetic AM (1-52) peptide was
purchased from Bachem Labs and used after its reconstitution in sterile
protease-free water.
Western blot analysis for AM detection. For Western blot analysis,
10 AL of cell-free supernatants obtained from parental, mock-transfected
(vector alone), and AM gene–transfected (AM stable transfected) PC-3 were
boiled for 5 min in SDS sample buffer [2% SDS, 50 mmol/L Tris-Cl (pH 6.8),
0.1% bromphenol blue, 10% glycerol], electrophoresed, transferred on
polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Bio-Rad), and immunoreacted with
anti-AM antibody (Bachem Labs) in TBS-Tween 20 buffer for 2 h at room
temperature. Immunoreactive bands were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham).
Recombinant cytokines and toxins. Recombinant chimeric fusion
protein IL-13PE38 (IL-13PE immunotoxin or IL-13PE) was expressed in
Escherichia coli and purified to >95% homogeneity in our laboratory as
described previously (15, 16). Recombinant IL-4 and IL-13 were also produced
as described (31). Recombinant IL-2 was a kind gift from Chiron Corp.
RNA extraction and reverse transcription-PCR. Total RNA was
extracted using the RNeasy RNA extraction kit (Qiagen) as per the
manufacturer’s instructions. The optimal reverse transcription-PCR
(RT-PCR) conditions for IL-13Ra2 chain (32) and AM and the primers
used in the amplification technique have been described previously (23).
Real-time RT-PCR analysis for IL-13Ra2 and h-actin was done using a
Bio-Rad Real-time iQ5 after designing gene-specific primers. The relative
fluorescence intensity was determined by dividing the intensity of IL-13Ra2
mRNA band by the intensity of h-actin band and expressed as a ratio of
relative fluorescence units (RFU; refs. 15, 30). The experiments were done
in quadruplicate.
IL-13R binding studies. Recombinant human IL-13 was labeled with
125
I (Amersham Research Products) using IODO-GEN reagent (Pierce)
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The specific activity of the
radiolabeled cytokine was estimated to range between 40 and 120 ACi/Ag of
protein. Binding experiments were done as described elsewhere (11).
Immunofluorescence assay. Twenty thousand cells were cultured in the
presence or absence of rAM in a chambered glass slide (Lab-Tek, Nalge
Nunc International) for 48 h under similar conditions as described earlier
(6). Additional three washes with PBS were included to remove culture
medium that contained AM or mock supernatant. This step minimized the
possibility of interference of exogenous AM in the assay. In some
experiments, PC-3 cells were preincubated with neutralizing rabbit antiAM antibody (1:100 dilution; a generous gift from Dr. Ouafik, IFR Jean
Roche, Marseille, France) for 1 h and subsequently cultured in the presence
of rAM or AM peptide for an additional 48 h to evaluate the specificity of
AM in up-regulation of IL-13Ra2. For controls, PC-3 cells were incubated
with an equal quantity of rabbit serum in parallel. Indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFA) was done for IL-13Ra2 and AM protein expression as
described above.
Cytotoxicity assay. The cytotoxicity of IL-13PE was determined as
described previously (17). For blocking experiments, the tumor cells were
preincubated with IL-13, IL-4, or IL-2 (2 Ag/mL) for 45 min before addition
of IL-13PE. The cells were maintained for 5 more days and then viable cell
population was measured by trypan blue exclusion dye technique.
Tumor xenograft studies. PC-3 cells transfected with AM- or mocktransfected or control (5  106) were injected s.c. in the right flank of male
athymic nude mice. When PC-3 control tumor xenografts reached a size of
20 F 4 mm2 within 1 wk, 100 ng AM peptide was injected intratumorally to
avoid any systemic adverse side effects every alternate day three times in
three sides of the tumor. Forty-eight hours after the last treatment, the

Cancer Res 2008; 68: (22). November 15, 2008

animals were sacrificed and tumors were excised and preserved for
detection of IL-13Ra2 mRNA by real-time RT-PCR and IL-13Ra2 protein by
immunohistochemical (IHC) techniques.
To determine the sensitivity of PC-3 tumors to IL-13PE after upregulation of IL-13Ra2 by AM transfection, IL-13PE (50 and 100 Ag/kg) or
PBS/0.2% human serum albumin (vehicle) was injected intratumorally
when the tumor size has reached 20 F 3.2 mm2. Animals with vector only–
transfected PC-3 cells served as controls. Treated and control animals were
followed for 5 wk, at which point the experiment was terminated due to
large tumor burden in control groups. The average values of three
independent experiments were calculated and expressed as mean F SD.
Statistical analysis. An unpaired two-tailed t test was used to detect
significant difference between experimental and corresponding control
groups using JMP software package (Brooks/Cole-Thompson Learning).
P values of V0.05 were considered significant.

Results
Expression of AM mRNA and immunoreactive protein in
stable transfected PC-3 tumor cells. The PC-3 cell line stably
transfected with AM gene transcribed mRNA and translated and
secreted AM protein in the cell-free supernatant. Real-time PCR
showed a significant increase in mRNA expression (P < 0.01) and
protein (see Supplementary Fig. S1A and B). The AM protein
from two different AM clones immunoreacted with a highly specific antibody and showed a single band of f6 kDa in the Western blot analysis. Cell-free supernatants from either PC-3 parental
or vector only–transfected PC-3 cells (mock transfected) did not
show a positive band for AM. As the band intensities for AM
protein at a seeding density of 0.5  106 cells per flask in four
independent experiments were identical for clone AM1, we used
this seeding density in all of our experiments to maintain consistent AM expression.
AM enhances IL-13RA2 expression in vitro and in vivo.
AM peptide was added to tumor cell cultures at various concentrations every alternate day and incubated for 3 days to
examine the effect of synthetic AM peptide on IL-13Ra2 mRNA
expression. By real-time RT-PCR studies, IL-13Ra2 mRNA expression was increased in a dose-dependent manner and approximately
7- to 8-fold increased expression was observed in treated cells
compared with untreated PC-3 cells (P < 0.01; Fig. 1A). Similar to
mRNA, protein for IL-13Ra2 was also increased by AM peptide
treatment (Fig. 1B).
For in vivo regulation, PC-3 tumor cells were injected s.c. in
immunodeficient animals. Eighteen days later, some tumors
received 100 ng AM peptide intratumorally, whereas some tumors
were injected with excipient. As shown in Fig. 1C, AM significantly
up-regulated IL-13Ra2 mRNA expression. Similar to in vitro study,
AM peptide up-regulated IL-13Ra2 mRNA expression by about
7- to 8-fold (P < 0.001). Expression of b-actin mRNA remained
uniform and unchanged in this tumor cell line, which indicated
that AM did not alter the transcription of all genes.
To examine whether gene-transfected tumor cells maintained
expression of IL-13Ra2 mRNA in vivo when these cells were s.c.
injected to develop tumors, we determined mRNA expression in
PC-3 AM and PC-3 mock tumors by real-time RT-PCR. As shown
in Fig. 1D, PC-3 AM explant tumors maintained significantly high
level expression of IL-13Ra2 mRNA 35 days after implantation
(P < 0.001). PC-3 control or mock-transfected tumors did not show
any up-regulation of receptor mRNA.
AM-transfected and control tumor cells were also analyzed
for protein expression for AM and IL-13Ra2. As shown in Fig. 2A,
PC-3 cells showed an intense immunofluorescence staining for

IL-13Ra2 Regulation by AM in Prostate Cancer

Figure 1. Up-regulation of IL-13Ra2 mRNA and protein by AM in vitro and in vivo. A, total RNA from PC-3 or PC-3 control or PC-3 cells treated with various
concentrations (50–500 ng/mL) of AM peptide was analyzed by real-time RT-PCR. RFU of IL-13Ra2 and b-actin was calculated and normalized from three independent
experiments. The data are statistically significant (**, P < 0.01). B, AM peptide–treated PC-3 cells were immunostained by IFA for IL-13Ra2 protein detection.
IL-13Ra2 mRNA expression by real-time PCR was evaluated in PC-3 xenograft tumors treated with AM peptide from three independent experiments (C) and in
AM-transfected PC-3 tumors compared with PC-3 or PC-3 mock–transfected tumors (D ). The results are statistically significant (***, P < 0.001).

IL-13Ra2 in green and AM protein in red in a stable PC-3 cell line
transfected with AM. Approximately 90% of the cells were positive
for AM and 82% were for IL-13Ra2 in a stable transfected PC-3 cell
line. Similar to real-time RT-PCR results, mock-transfected cells
showed a basal level for AM and IL-13Ra2. When two images were
merged, IL-13Ra2 and AM showed a yellow immunofluorescence in
68% of AM-transfected cells (Fig. 2A), indicating that both red and
green immunofluorescent proteins (AM and IL-13Ra2) were colocalized. The remaining cells may have a minimal overlap of the two
colors or these proteins coexpressed at levels below the detection
limit of the assay. These results indicate that prostate tumor cells
express IL-13Ra2 protein at a basal level and AM treatment upregulates its transcription and translation in treated cells.
To examine the specificity of IL-13Ra2 up-regulation by AM,
PC-3 tumor cells were preincubated with AM neutralizing antibody

or isotype control antibody for 45 minutes before treatment with
AM peptide or rAM and RT-PCR assay was done for IL-13Ra2
As shown in Fig. 2B, rAM and AM peptide up-regulated IL-13Ra2
mRNA compared with control cells. Neutralizing antibody to AM
decreased expression of IL-13Ra2 mRNA induced by rAM as well as
AM peptide. However, isotype control antibody had no effect.
The specificity of IL-13Ra2 up-regulation in AM-treated PC-3
cells was also evaluated at protein levels (Fig. 2C). PC-3 cells
were incubated with AM in the presence of either neutralizing
antibody to AM or isotype IgG control. The cells were then immunostained with either AM antibody or IL-13Ra2 antibody to detect
the level of expression of these two proteins. Neutralizing antibody
to AM decreased not only AM protein expression but also IL-13Ra2
protein levels. In contrast, isotype control IgG did not decrease
expression of AM or IL-13Ra2 protein.

Radiolabeled binding and competition study. Based on RTPCR and immunofluorescence results, we predicted that radiolabeled IL-13 would specifically bind to AM gene–transfected PC3 cells. Therefore, binding studies were done using 125I-IL-13 in
PC-3, PC-3 mock, and four clones of AM-transfected PC-3 cells. As
shown in Fig. 2D, only four clones of PC-3 AM cells bound 125I-IL13 at high levels (P < 0.001). Total 125I-IL-13 binding was inhibited
by excess of unlabeled IL-13 indicating specificity of IL-13
binding. PC-3 control or mock-transfected cells showed no
specific binding.
In vivo regulation of IL-13Ra2 by AM. To investigate
regulation of IL-13Ra2 by AM in vivo and IHC and in situ
hybridization (ISH) studies were performed on paraffin-embedded

tissue sections obtained from PC-3 mock–transfected and PC-3
AM–transfected tumors. PC-3 AM tumor explants showed
moderate immunostaining for IL-13Ra2 compared with weakly
positive staining (F) in isotype sections or PC-3 mock explants (see
Supplementary Fig. S2A). Percent positive fields were found to be
58% in PC-3 AM tumors and 8% in PC-3 mock tumor sections.
Isotype control sections did not show any appreciable fluorescence
and served as a negative control in the IHC assay. ISH for IL-13Ra2
mRNA was a more sensitive assay and indicated that IL-13Ra2
mRNA was overexpressed in AM xenograft tumors compared with
mock tumor tissues. A sense riboprobe for IL-13Ra2 gene served as
a negative control in ISH experiments, which did not show any
staining (see Supplementary Fig. S2B).

Figure 2. Specificity of up-regulation of IL-13Ra2 by AM peptide and rAM. A, PC-3 cells were stained with either isotype control or polyclonal antibody to AM or
monoclonal antibody to IL-13Ra2 as described in Materials and Methods. AM was detected using TRITC-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG to develop red fluorescence,
whereas IL-13Ra2 was detected using FITC-conjugated anti-mouse IgG green fluorescence. The colocalization of both proteins in all three tumor cell lines was
analyzed by merging the same field for TRITC- and FITC-immunostained red and green fluorescent tumor cells. Magnification, 400. B, RNA was extracted from
AM peptide–treated PC-3 cells in the presence of AM antibody or isotype IgG and RT-PCR analysis was done for IL-13Ra2 mRNA expression. b-Actin expression
was used as a housekeeping gene. RNA from H9 cells served as negative control and PM-RCC as positive control for IL-13Ra2 expression. C, PC-3 cells were
treated with AM in the presence or absence of antibody to AM or isotype IgG. The cells were stained with anti-AM and anti-IL-13Ra2 antibody. Magnification, 400.
D, receptor binding assay was done in PC-3, PC-3 mock, and AM-expressing PC-3 clones by incubating with 125I-IL-13 (black columns) or with 200 cold IL-13
(white columns ) for competition. Bound CPM was measured in the cell pellet on a gamma counter. Columns, mean of duplicate determination; bars, SD. The
experiment was repeated thrice. The values are statistically significant (***, P < 0.001).

IL-13Ra2 Regulation by AM in Prostate Cancer

Enhanced sensitivity of AM-PC-3 tumor cells to IL-13PE
in vitro and in vivo. To determine the functional activity of
overexpressed IL-13Ra2 protein by AM in tumor cells, we tested
the cytotoxic activity of IL-13PE by measuring cell viability in control, AM-transfected, and AM peptide–treated PC-3 prostate tumor
cell lines. Tumor cell lines were incubated in the presence of
different concentrations of IL-13PE and cell viability was measured
after 5 days in treated and untreated control tumor cells. IL-13PE
was only slightly cytotoxic to PC-3 parental and mock-transfected
control cell lines. However, AM peptide treatment of PC-3 cells
resulted in a significant decrease in cell viability compared with
untreated control cells (P < 0.05; Fig. 3A). Similarly, in AMtransfected PC-3 cells, a significant decrease in cell viability
(P < 0.01) was observed by IL-13PE treatment (Fig. 3B). The IC50
(concentration of IL-13PE that decreases 50% cell viability) was
f5.0 ng/mL in PC-3 AM–transfected cells compared with PC-3
mock cells (>1,000 ng/mL; Fig. 3B). This increase in sensitivity
was highly specific to IL-13PE as only IL-13 but not IL-4 or IL-2
could block the cytotoxic activity of IL-13PE in PC-3 AM–
transfected cells (data not shown).
To determine the significance of up-regulated IL-13Ra2 chain
in vivo in mouse model of human prostate cancer, PC-3, PC-3
mock–transfected, and AM-transfected prostate tumor cells were
s.c. implanted in nude mice. Beginning day 12 of implantation,
tumors were treated with 100 ng AM peptide every alternate day
for 3 days, and then 2 days later, some tumors were injected with
IL-13PE (50 or 100 Ag/kg/d) every alternate day for 3 days. Mice
bearing mock tumor or AM-transfected tumors were intratumorally injected with IL-13PE (50 or 100 Ag/kg/d) every alternate
day for 3 days and followed for tumor growth. As shown in Fig. 4A,
both doses of IL-13PE decreased AM-treated tumor growth
significantly compared with excipient treated mice (P < 0.05).
In sharp contrast, IL-13PE did not have any effect on growth of
mock-transfected tumors (Fig. 4B). All mice showed similar growth
of tumors whether treated with 50 or 100 Ag/kg/d IL-13PE or
excipient control.

IL-13PE also caused significant inhibition of AM-transfected
tumor growth in a dose-dependent manner (P < 0.05 and 0.01,
respectively; Fig. 4C). At the highest dose (100 Ag/kg/d), the tumor
size remained smaller at all time points of monitoring compared
with 50 Ag/kg IL-13PE dose. At day 29 after IL-13PE treatment,
tumor size in treated group (38 F 4.0 mm2) was f75% lower
compared with excipient treated tumor (220 F 18.0 mm2; P < 0.01).
PC-3 tumors in control groups increased to 220 F 18.0 mm2 in size
at day 45, at that time the experiment was terminated due to large
tumor burden in control group.

Discussion
We show that exogenous AM protein or a synthetic peptide upregulates IL-13Ra2 mRNA and protein in prostate tumor cells
in vitro and in vivo in an animal model of human prostate tumor.
IL-13a2 overexpression by AM was highly specific as neutralization of AM by antibody diminished IL-13Ra2 mRNA and protein
levels. Interestingly, overexpression of IL-13Ra2 protein by AM
sensitized tumor cells to an exclusively selective receptor–directed
cytotoxic agent such as IL-13PE. IL-13PE immunotoxin mediated
enhanced cytotoxicity to prostate tumor cells in vitro when treated
with AM peptide or stably transfected with AM gene. This
cytotoxicity was highly specific as an excess of IL-13 but not IL-4
or IL-2 neutralized IL-13PE–mediated cytotoxicity. Similar to
in vitro studies, IL-13PE also mediated antitumor effects against
AM peptide–treated or AM-transfected PC-3 tumors in vivo. These
results provide proof of principle that AM-regulated IL-13Ra2 gene
makes a functional receptor on tumor cell surface in vivo for
receptor-directed therapy by IL-13PE. Partial response to this
approach in >70% of AM-transfected PC-3 tumor-bearing mice may
be improved by designing effective delivery of this immunotoxin
in tumor.
The mechanism of up-regulation of IL-13Ra2 chain by AM in
prostate tumor cells is not known. Preliminary studies indicate
that AM directly interacts with IL-13Ra2 gene and that AM

of AM peptide (100 and 250 ng/mL) for 48 h. Cells were then treated with various concentrations of IL-13PE for 20 h. Cell viability was measured after 5 d using trypan
blue exclusion assay in hemocytometer. Points, mean percent viable cells; bars, SD. Untreated cells served as control. The experiment was repeated thrice and
statistically significant differences (P < 0.05) were compared with control and AM-treated PC-3 cells. B, PC-3 control, PC-3 mock–transfected, and PC-3 AM–
transfected tumor cells were incubated with various concentrations of IL-13PE. The viable cells were counted after 5 d. Points, mean percent viable cells; bars, SD.
Untreated cells served as 100% control. The results are statistically significant (**, P < 0.01).

Figure 4. Antitumor activity of IL-13PE in AM-treated or
AM-transfected PC-3 prostate tumors. A, nude mice were
implanted with 5  106 PC-3 tumor cells s.c. When tumors were
established, AM peptide at a fixed dose (100 ng/kg) was injected
directly into tumors every alternate day for three injections. Two
days after AM treatment, these tumors were then injected with two
different doses of IL-13PE (50 and 100 Ag/kg) every alternate day
for 3 d. Tumor sizes were measured. Points, mean of six animals

stabilizes IL-13Ra2 transcripts and prolongs its translation. In
addition, it has been shown that human tumor cell lines that
express the IL-13Ra2 chain are highly susceptible to the
cytotoxic effect of IL-13PE in vitro and in vivo in animal models
of human cancers (10, 19). However, tumor cell lines that
expressed low levels of IL-13R were dramatically less sensitive to
this targeted cytotoxin (33). We later showed that when tumor
cells were transfected with IL-13Ra2 chain, they showed
enhanced sensitivity to IL-13 cytotoxin compared with wild-type
or mock-transfected tumor cells (34, 35). As normal immune
cells, endothelial cells, or other cells do not express IL-13Ra2, IL13 cytotoxin is slightly or not cytotoxic to these cells (17, 32).
These observations suggest that IL-13Ra2 chain provides a
unique target for receptor-directed cancer therapy and combination of pretreatment with AM followed by IL-13 cytotoxin
therapy may lead to better antitumor activity.
It is possible that pretreatment of host with AM may also upregulate IL-13Ra2 in normal cells, leading to toxicity to IL-13
cytotoxin administration. However, in vivo administration of AM
in tumors did not cause toxicity in animals. It is to be noted that
rAM or AM peptide does not seem to induce IL-13Ra2 expression
in cells that do not naturally express this chain (results not
shown). Most normal cells, such as B cells, T cells, monocytes,
and endothelial cells, do not express basal levels of IL-13Ra2
chain (1, 2, 5). Similar to normal immune cells, other prostate
cancer cell lines, such as DU145 or LNCaP, also do not express

basal levels of IL-13Ra2 chain and therefore do not show upregulation of IL-13Ra2 and sensitivity toward IL-13PE. Lack of
constitutive expression of IL-13R expression in prostate cancer
cell lines may represent heterogeneity in IL-13R in prostate
cancer. In this regard, our results are similar to previous studies,
which showed that IL-13Ra2 chain is not expressed by all tumors.
Thirty percent to 72% of head and neck, ovarian, and brain tumor
samples express high levels of IL-13Ra2 chain, whereas others
express none or modest levels of IL-13Ra2 chain (2, 5, 6, 15, 17,
18, 21, 36). Although a large number of prostate cancer samples
need to be evaluated for IL-13R expression, our results suggest
testing IL-13R expression in clinical biopsy samples before
enrolling subjects in clinical trials involving AM-directed and
IL-13R–directed cytotoxin/immunotoxin or gene therapies. Based on the knowledge of basal level expression of IL13R, we may be able to predict ‘‘a priori’’ which patients will
respond to IL-13R–targeted therapy and which patients will not.
Future studies will address these important issues. In addition, we
are studying other tumor types in which AM can up-regulate IL13Ra2.
In conclusion, we have identified AM, a new class of tumor
sensitizer for IL-13R–targeted anticancer therapy, in certain types
of prostate cancers. IL-13R–directed therapy may be useful in
prostate cancers with low expression of IL-13Ra2 after AM
treatment followed by IL-13PE cytotoxin-based therapy. Finally,
as recent studies have identified IL-13Ra2 chain as a tumor
