Abstract
Low serum levels of adiponectin are a high risk factor for
various types of cancer. Although adiponectin inhibits
proliferation and metastasis of breast cancer cells, the
underlying molecular mechanisms remain obscure. In this
study, we show that adiponectin-activated AMPK reduces the
invasiveness of MDA-MB-231 cells by stimulating dephosphorylation of AKT by increasing protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A)
activity. Among the various regulatory B56 subunits, B56; was
directly phosphorylated by AMPK at Ser298 and Ser336, leading
to an increase of PP2A activity through dephosphorylation of
PP2Ac at Tyr307. We also show that both the blood levels of
adiponectin and the tissue levels of PP2A activity were
decreased in breast cancer patients and that the direct
administration of adiponectin into tumor tissues stimulates
PP2A activity. Taken together, these findings show that
adiponectin, derived from adipocytes, negatively regulates
the invasiveness of breast cancer cells by activating the tumor
suppressor PP2A. [Cancer Res 2009;69(9):4018–26]

Introduction
Obesity is an independent risk factor for the development of
breast cancer. Increasing evidence suggests that adipose tissue may
play an important role in regulating breast cancer progression and
distant metastasis (1). The aberrant production of adipokines,
adipose tissue secreting cytokines, plays an important role in the
pathogenesis of obesity-related breast carcinogenesis. Some
adipokines, including leptin, heparin-binding epidermal growth
factor, and collagen VI act directly on breast cancer cells to
stimulate their proliferation, invasiveness, and malignancy (2).
Several recent studies have shown that low serum adiponectin is
highly associated with obesity-related cancers, including endometrial, breast, prostate, and gastric cancers. In addition, breast
tumors in women with low serum adiponectin levels are more
likely to show an aggressive phenotype and adiponectin suppresses
the metastasis of breast cancer cells (3).
Many reports show that inactivation of AKT by dephosphorylation, which plays a key role in tumor suppression, occurs
concomitantly with the activation of AMPK. For example, the two
AMPK-activating drugs, phenformin and 5-aminoimidazole-4carboxamide-1-h-D-ribofuranoside (AICAR), inactivate AKT by

dephosphorylation (4). A mammary carcinogenesis inhibitor, 2deoxyglucose, also activates AMPK and inactivates AKT in MDAMB-468 human breast cancer cells (5). Deguelin, a lung cancer
chemopreventive agent, induces activation of AMPK and inactivation of AKT (6). Although many reports show concomitant AMPK
activation and AKT inactivation, little is known about how the
activated AMPK is able to inactivate AKT.
Protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) is a major cellular serine/
threonine phosphatase that plays important roles in cell proliferation and cell transformation (7–10). For example, PP2A blocks
entry into mitosis (11), inactivates the antiapoptotic protein Bcl-2
in Jurkat cells (12), and destabilizes the c-Myc oncoprotein by
dephosphorylating Ser62 (13). The evidence of an antitumor role for
PP2A was supported by the identification of alterations in PP2A
subunits in human cancers. Many alterations in the gene encoding
the Ah subunit have been identified, primarily in human lung and
colorectal cancers (14, 15). In addition, mutations (16) and reduced
expression of the Aa subunit have been reported in human tumors
(17) and in the MCF-7 breast cancer cell line (18). In addition to
alterations of the A subunits, many alterations to the tumor
suppressor activity mediated by the PP2A B56 subunit have been
reported. A truncated B56g1 isoform has been identified in a
metastatic clone of the mouse B16 melanoma cells, BL16 (19). This
truncation prevents a critical interaction between B56g-containing
PP2A and p53, resulting in a decrease in tumor suppressor activity
(20). B56g-containing PP2A also inhibits Wnt signaling through hcatenin degradation in Xenopus (21). B56a directs PP2A holoenzymes to c-Myc, resulting in a reduction of c-Myc levels (22). In this
study, we examine the ability of AMPK, activated by adiponectin to
activate PP2A by phosphorylation of its B56 subunit, which in turn
suppresses invasiveness by inactivating AKT.

Materials and Methods
Reagents and plasmids. Plasmids encoding AMPK-DN were obtained
from Dr. Juhun Ha (Kyunghee University). Plasmids encoding AMPK-WT
and AMPK-CA were obtained from Dr. David Carling (MRC Clinical
Sciences Centre). B56a, B56h, B56g, and B56y were amplified by pfu PCR
from a human brain cDNA library and subcloned into the pCMV-tag2B
expression vector. The S261A, S298A, S336A, and S298A/S336A B56g1
mutants were generated using a mutation primer and subcloned into the
pCMV-tag2B expression vector.
Invasion and proliferation assay. The ability of cells to migrate
through Matrigel-coated filters was determined using modified 24-well
Transwell cell culture chambers. Cells were seeded at a density of 1  104
per well and treated with 20 Ag/mL adiponectin for the indicated times.
Cells that subsequently invaded the lower chamber of each plate were
labeled with calcein-AM (Molecular Probes) and measured with a Wallace
1420 Victor3 plate reader (Perkin-Elmer) at an excitation of 485 F 10 nm
and an emission of 520 F 10 nm. For the proliferation assay, cells were
seeded in 12-well plates at a density of 1  105 per well and subsequently

treated with 20 Ag/mL adiponectin. The numbers of viable cells at different
time points were determined by manually counting cells that did not stain
with trypan blue dye.
Horizontal migration assay. The EZ-TAXIScan (Effector Cell Institute)
was used to detect real-time horizontal migration of MDA-MB-231 cells.
Adiponectin-pretreated MDA-MB-231 cells were placed into the single hole
and DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum was placed into the contrahole. A charge-coupled device camera was used to record the migration of
the cells toward the DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum. Moving cells
in a fixed gate were counted using the TAXIScan Analyzer.
Preparation of conditioned medium and zymography. Subconfluent
cells were washed three times with serum-free medium and cultured for
24 h in the absence or presence of 20 Ag/mL adiponectin. The conditioned
medium was collected and clarified by centrifugation and then concentrated by a Centricon centrifugal filter (Millipore). Gelatinolytic activity in
the conditioned medium was analyzed by zymography.
Immunoblot analysis. Analyses of cell lysates were done as described
previously (23). Phospho-AMPK, phospho-AKT (Cell Signaling), and
phospho-PP2Ac (Abcam) antibodies were used. Levels of phosphorylation
were quantified relative to h-actin or a-tubulin.
AMPK, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, and PP2A phosphatase
activity assay. Transfected cells were lysed and incubated with antiPP2Ac antibody for 2 h. After the addition of 30 AL agarose A-beads,
lysates were further incubated for 2 h at 4jC. Immunoprecipitates were
washed three times with AMPK kinase reaction buffer (Cell Signaling).
The immunoprecipitates were resuspended in 50 AL AMPK kinase
reaction buffer containing 50 ng recombinant AMPK kinase, 0.16 ACi 32Plabeled ATP, and 250 Amol/L ATP followed by incubation for 30 min at
room temperature. The reactions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Autoradiographs were visualized with a FLA-3000G Three-Laser Imaging
System (Fujifilm). Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) activity was
assayed with the PI3K ELISA kit (Echelon Biosciences) in accordance

with the manufacturer’s instructions. PP2A activity was determined using
a serine/threonine phosphatase assay system in accordance with the
manufacturer’s protocols (Promega). Cells were briefly lysed with a
phosphatase lysis buffer [20 mmol/L HEPES (pH 7.4), 10% glycerol, 0.1%
NP-40, 30 mmol/L h-mercaptoethanol, 1 mmol/L EGTA] and measured
for phosphatase activity using a PP2A-type specific buffer [50 mmol/L
imidazole (pH 7.2), 0.2 mmol/L EGTA, 0.03% h-mercaptoethanol, 0.1 mg/
mL bovine serum albumin]. Free phosphate, generated from a synthetic
phosphothreonine peptide RRA(pT)VA specific for PP2A, was quantified
by measuring molybdate/malachite green/phosphate complex at 600 nm.
EGTA and EDTA were included in the lysis buffer to inhibit PP2B and
PP2C, respectively. Okadaic acid was used to confirm the specificity of
these reaction conditions.
Subcellular fractionation. Cells were treated with 20 Ag/mL adiponectin for 30 min and membrane fractions were obtained as described
previously (24).
Tumor formation. Female BALB/c mice (6 weeks old; Dae Han Biolink)
were subcutaneously injected with 1.2  104 4T1 adenocarcinoma cells in
the right anterior mammary region. BALB/c mice bearing 4T1 murine
mammary tumors were intratumorally injected with 100 Ag recombinant
adiponectin and 0.2 mg of the AMPK activator AICAR on day 14 after initial
implantation of the 4T1 cells. Primary tumors were collected and subjected
to further analysis 8 h after the injection.
Small interfering RNA preparation. The following small interfering
RNA (siRNA) sequences were designed and purchased from Samchully

Subjects. Tumor and normal tissue samples were collected from patients
with newly diagnosed breast cancer with the patients’ consent. Patients
were surgically treated at the Young Dong Severance Hospital.
Statistical analysis. Data (mean F SE) were statistically analyzed using
an unpaired t test. P < 0.05 was considered a significant difference.

Results
Adiponectin suppresses metastasis of MDA-MB-231 cells. To
determine the direct effects of adiponectin on the invasiveness of
breast cancer cells, we performed invasion assays with MDA-MB231 cells. The invasiveness of MDA-MB-231 cells was significantly
reduced 24 h after treatment with adiponectin, but statistically
significant inhibition of proliferation was not observed at the same
time (Fig. 1A). One caveat to this study is that previous work has
shown that adiponectin induces apoptosis of MDA-MB-231 cells.
We therefore tested if adiponectin-mediated apoptosis is respon-

sible for the observed decrease in invasiveness. Our data show that
adiponectin induces apoptosis in only 3% of the cells (Supplementary Fig. S1) but suppresses invasiveness by 33%, indicating that a
reduction in proliferation and an increase in apoptosis induction
are responsible for only a small percent of the decrease in
invasiveness induced by adiponectin. We next tested whether
adiponectin could induce migration. The migration of cells in the
presence of adiponectin was directly visualized using the EZTAXIScan, which monitors the real-time horizontal movement of
cells. This analysis showed that the migration of adiponectinpretreated MDA-MB-231 cells was dramatically inhibited compared
with control cells (Fig. 1B).
To understand the detailed molecular events that underlie the
inhibition of invasiveness by adiponectin, we examined the
expression levels of metastasis-associated genes. Treatment with
adiponectin greatly reduced the expression levels of the

AMPK Inhibits AKT by Increasing PP2A Activity

Figure 3. Effect of adiponectin on the subcellular localization of PP2A. A, cells were pretreated with 250 nmol/L okadaic acid and an invasion assay was done in
the presence of 20 Ag/mL adiponectin and 250 Amol/L AICAR. Mean F SE of three independent experiments. **, P < 0.01. B, cells were transfected with 3 Ag
constitutively active AKT (CA-AKT ) or constitutively active AMPK (CA-AMPK) expression plasmids. Immunoprecipitations using an anti-PP2Ac antibody were done on
cell lysates 24 h after transfection. Interactions between PP2A and AKT or AMPK were analyzed using immunoblot analysis (top ). Cells treated with adiponectin
and okadaic acid for 30 min were lysed and then subjected to an immunoprecipitation using anti-AKT antibody. Interactions between AKT and PP2Ac were examined
by immunoblot analysis using 2% input and 20% immunoprecipitation samples (bottom ). C, cells were treated with okadaic acid or adiponectin for 30 min and
endogenous localization of PP2A was examined by confocal microscopy. Images were quantified by FV300 analysis. *, P < 0.05, **, P < 0.01 versus control. D, cells
were treated with adiponectin, okadaic acid, or both. Membrane fraction was obtained 30 min after treatment and subjected to immunoblot analysis.

metastasis-promoting gene uPA, whereas the mRNA expression
of TIMP-2, a metastasis-suppressing gene, was significantly
increased (Fig. 1C). Zymography analysis also showed that the
activities of matrix metalloproteinase-2 and -9 were markedly
inhibited by treatment with adiponectin (Fig. 1D).
Adiponectin stimulates dephosphorylation of AKT
through AMPK. To decipher the signal transduction pathway
involved in the inhibition of invasion, changes in phosphorylation patterns of kinases were analyzed. Phosphorylation of p38
was slightly increased, whereas phosphorylation of AKT1/2 and
GSK3h was significantly inhibited by adiponectin treatment
(Supplementary Fig. S2). In addition, adiponectin time-dependently increased AMPK phosphorylation and decreased AKT
phosphorylation (Fig. 2A). To determine whether AKT dephosphorylation is due to AMPK activation, AKT phosphorylation
was examined after treatment with AICAR, an AMPK activator,
and compound C, an AMPK inhibitor. Like adiponectin, AICAR
stimulated dephosphorylation of AKT, whereas compound C
blocked AMPK phosphorylation and AKT dephosphorylation by
adiponectin (Fig. 2B). These results indicate that AMPK

activation is associated with adiponectin-induced AKT dephosphorylation.
To test whether adiponectin-activated AMPK inhibits AKT
phosphorylation through the inhibition of PI3K (the upstream
activator of the AKT signaling pathway), PI3K activity was
measured in cells treated with adiponectin, AICAR, and compound
C. Adiponectin and AICAR failed to inhibit PI3K activity, indicating
that AMPK-induced AKT dephosphorylation is not mediated by the
suppression of PI3K activity (Supplementary Fig. S3).
Adiponectin-activated AMPK increases PP2A activity. To
examine whether PP2A is associated with AKT dephosphorylation,
PP2A activity was measured. PP2A activity was greatly increased in
cells treated with adiponectin or AICAR for 30 min (Fig. 2C). Next,
cells were treated with the PP2A inhibitor okadaic acid to examine
whether PP2A activation is indeed involved in AKT dephosphorylation. Interestingly, okadaic acid completely blocked adiponectinmediated AKT dephosphorylation of Ser308 and Ser473, whereas it
did not affect phosphorylation of AMPK (Fig. 2D). To investigate
whether the increase in PP2A activity is indeed involved in the
inhibition of invasion, cells were pretreated with okadaic acid

30 min before adiponectin treatment. Figure 3A shows that PP2A
blocked the inhibitory effect of adiponectin on invasiveness. These
results imply that PP2A is an important signaling molecule
involved in the adiponectin-mediated suppression of invasiveness.
Because adiponectin-activated AMPK increases the activity of
PP2A and the resulting PP2A causes the dephosphorylation of AKT,
we examined whether AMPK and AKT directly interact with PP2A.
An immunoprecipitation using an anti-PP2Ac antibody was done
in lysates from cells overexpressing constitutively active AMPK and
AKT. The precipitates were then analyzed by immunoblot.
Phospho-AMPK and phospho-AKT were detected in the immunoprecipitates (Fig. 3B, top). To examine whether adiponectin
increases the interaction between endogenous AKT and PP2Ac, a
pull-down was done on adiponectin-treated cell lysates with an
anti-AKT antibody. The level of PP2Ac in the precipitate was then
determined. Adiponectin increased the interaction between
endogenous AKT and PP2Ac, which could be inhibited with
okadaic acid (Fig. 3B, bottom).
Adiponectin regulates membrane localization of PP2A
activity. Because PP2A function is regulated by localization,

PP2A localization was examined. Adiponectin treatment leads to
the translocation of PP2A from the nucleus to the cytosol and
plasma membrane, whereas PP2A remains in the nucleus with
okadaic acid treatment (Fig. 3C). This result indicates that the
translocation of PP2Ac to the cytosol may substantially contribute
to the enhancement of the AKT dephosphorylation caused by
adiponectin.
To further characterize the effect of adiponectin on the
differential localization of PP2A, membrane fractions were
examined in cells treated with adiponectin in the presence or
absence of okadaic acid. The treatment of adiponectin markedly
increased membrane localization of PP2A. However, treatment
with adiponectin and okadaic acid prevented the adiponectininduced membrane localization of PP2A (Fig. 3D).
AMPK stimulates the dephosphorylation of the PP2A
catalytic subunit leading to increased activity. Phosphorylation
of Tyr307 on PP2Ac decreases its phosphatase activity (25).
Therefore, it was expected that adiponectin-activated AMPK might
stimulate the dephosphorylation of PP2Ac at Tyr307, resulting in an
increase of phosphatase activity. To test this possibility, the level of

AMPK Inhibits AKT by Increasing PP2A Activity

by AMPK. A, cells were transfected with
3 Ag FLAG-tagged B56g-expressing
vector. Phosphorylation levels of PP2Ac
and AKT were examined using immunoblot

immunoprecipitates were treated with
50 ng recombinant AMPK and 32P-labeled
ATP to examine phosphorylation of
B56g (bottom ). B, cells were transfected
with various B56g mutants and
immunoprecipitated using anti-FLAG

phosphorylation levels of B56g. C,
phosphatase activity of PP2A was

phospho-PP2Ac was measured in adiponectin-treated cells. As
expected, adiponectin stimulated the dephosphorylation of PP2Ac.
Cotreatment of cells with okadaic acid and adiponectin inhibited
dephosphorylation of PP2Ac and also blocked AKT dephosphorylation, but AMPK activation was not affected by the phosphorylation status of PP2Ac (Fig. 4A). These results indicate that
adiponectin-induced dephosphorylation of PP2Ac increases PP2A
phosphatase activity, resulting in dephosphorylation of AKT.
Adiponectin-mediated increase in phosphatase activity is
impaired by the knockdown of B56B, B56;, and B56D isoforms
of PP2A. PP2A is a trimer composed of a catalytic C subunit, a
scaffold A subunit, and multiple regulatory B subunits that are
thought to influence enzyme activity, substrate specificity, and
subcellular localization. It is therefore possible that AMPK
regulates PP2A activity through modification of the regulatory B
subunit. Among the B subunits, the B56 subunit is known to play
an antioncogenic role in cancer (26), so we determined which B56
isoform was related to adiponectin-mediated PP2A activation.
siRNAs to various B56 isoforms were designed, and their efficiency
was determined by reverse transcription-PCR (Supplementary
Fig. S4). Next, cells were treated for 30 min with adiponectin after
the transfection of each B56 isoform siRNA. Adiponectin-mediated
AMPK phosphorylation was not impaired in the absence of all B56
isoforms, whereas adiponectin-mediated dephosphorylation of
AKT and PP2Ac was significantly impaired in the absence of
B56g and B56y expression (Fig. 4B).
To examine if impaired phosphorylation by PP2Ac also affected
its activity, phosphatase activity was measured after treatment with
adiponectin in cells treated with siRNA to the B56 isoforms.
Knockdown of B56g and B56y showed no resulting increase in
PP2A activity with adiponectin, whereas knockdown of B56a and
B56h expression did not affect adiponectin-increased PP2A
activity. Knockdown of B56g and B56y expression decreased even
basal PP2A activity (Fig. 4C). This result implies that B56g and
B56y expression is necessary for adiponectin-mediated PP2A
activation.
AMPK directly phosphorylates B56 isoforms. We hypothesized that AMPK may phosphorylate the B56g and B56y isoforms,

www.aacrjournals.org

which in turn stimulate PP2A activity. To test this possibility,
AMPK phosphorylation sites on the B56 isoforms were predicted
using a the NetPhos 2.0 server. Several AMPK consensus sequences
(27) were present in B56h, B56g, and B56y, whereas the B56a
subunit does not have an AMPK phosphorylation site. The B56h
subunit has two predicted potential sites, and the B56g and B56y
subunits have three sites (Supplementary Table S1). To determine
whether these predicted sites are indeed phosphorylated by AMPK,
overexpressed FLAG-tagged B56g was immunoprecipitated and
incubated with recombinant AMPK and isotope-labeled ATP. As
predicted, B56g was phosphorylated by AMPK (Fig. 5A). To predict
the exact phosphorylation site of B56g, S261A, S298A, and S336A
mutants were generated and subjected to an in vitro phosphorylation assay. S298A and S336A mutants of B56g were partially
phosphorylated. Thus, a S298A/S336A double mutant was generated. The level of phosphorylation in the S298A/S336A double
mutant was completely blocked, indicating that AMPK phosphorylates both S298 and S336 residues (Fig. 5B). To determine if PP2A
activity is affected by B56g mutants, PP2A activity was measured in
cells overexpressing B56g mutants. Expression of the S298A/S336A
double mutant failed to increase phosphatase activity compared
with expression of the wild-type form (Fig. 5C).
Adiponectin increases PP2A activity in vivo. We wondered
whether adiponectin levels and PP2A activities were decreased in
human breast tumor tissues. The level of adiponectin was
significantly decreased in the serum of patients (Fig. 6A), and
PP2A activities were dramatically reduced compared with that of
adjacent normal tissues (Fig. 6B). Next, we wondered whether the
direct administration of adiponectin into a tumor mass would
increase PP2A activity in a murine mammary tumor model. Thus,
intratumoral administration of adiponectin was done 14 days after
initial implantation of 4T1 murine mammary tumor cells into
syngeneic BALB/c mice. PP2A activity within the adiponectininjected tumor mass was measured 8 h after the intratumoral
administration. PP2A activity increased within the adiponectininjected tumor masses (Fig. 6C), consistent with the result seen in
the breast cancer cell line. The phosphorylation levels of PP2Ac and
AMPK were also evaluated. The phosphorylation level of PP2Ac

decreased and the phosphorylation level of AMPK increased in
adiponectin-injected tumor mass (Fig. 6D), indicating that
adiponectin was indeed able to increase PP2A activity through
AMPK activation in vivo.

Discussion
Although it has not yet been determined if the decreased
production of adiponectin is a cause or a result of breast cancer
growth, it is conceivable that tumor cells may grow well and gain
metastatic potential more easily in an environment in which
adiponectin is decreased because adiponectin suppresses the
metastasis and proliferation of cancer cells through AKT
inactivation. However, the molecular mechanism underlying this
process is not fully understood. Recently, it was shown that AMPK,
activated by energy depletion, phosphorylates IRS-1 at Ser794,
leading to the inhibition of AKT through suppression of PI3K (28).
In this study, however, our data clearly showed that AMPK
activates PP2A, which directly inactivates AKT by the dephosphorylation of Thr308 and Ser473 without affecting PI3K activity,
indicating that AMPK is able to suppress AKT function by either an
IRS-1-dependent or a PP2A-dependent pathway. In addition to
AKT suppression by AMPK-activated PP2A, there is another
possible mechanism by which AMPK affects AKT activity. The
mammalian target of rapamycin complex (mTORC) 2 phosphorylates AKT at Ser473 (29, 30), and the TSC2 complex is required for
AKT phosphorylation by mTORC2 (31). Because AMPK phosphor-

ylates and activates TSC2, it is possible that adiponectin-activated
AMPK affects the activity of AKT through the regulation of
mTORC2 activation. Therefore, it remains to be determined if
adiponectin-activated AMPK is able to regulate mTORC2 activity
through TSC2 phosphorylation.
In contrast to the AMPK-mediated regulation of AKT activity,
AKT is also able to regulate AMPK function. AKT increases the
production of ATP through accelerated aerobic glycolysis in
tumors (32, 33), leading to the increase in intracellular ATP level,
which in turn decreases AMPK activity. Moreover, AKT and AMPK
reciprocally regulate mTORC1 activity through the differential
phosphorylation of TSC2. In the presence of growth factors, AKT
phosphorylates TSC2, leading to an increase in mTORC1 activity,
resulting in the activation of the ATP-consuming pathway. In low
nutritional conditions, AMPK phosphorylates TSC2 at a different
site, leading to the suppression of mTORC1 activity, resulting in the
activation of the ATP-producing pathway. The bidirectional
communication between AMPK and AKT plays an important role
in the regulation of cellular energy balance. Therefore, the
disruption of AMPK and AKT crosstalk may play a critical role in
the deregulation of cell cycle or tumor progression. The complete
understanding of bidirectional communication between AMPK and
AKT may uncover a potential therapeutic target.
Our data show that the phosphorylation of B56g by AMPK
increases dephosphorylation of PP2Ac at Tyr307, leading to the upregulation of PP2A activity. This result may be explained by the
autodephosphorylation of PP2A (25, 34). That is, AMPK-mediated

AMPK Inhibits AKT by Increasing PP2A Activity

phosphorylation of B56g affects phosphotyrosyl phosphatase
activity, causing an increase in the basal level of protein tyrosine
phosphatase activity of PP2A (35–38). However, we cannot
completely exclude the possibility that phosphorylated B56 recruits
a tyrosine phosphatase or phosphotyrosyl phosphatase activator
into the entire PP2A complex, which is responsible for the
dephosphorylation of PP2A at Tyr307. A complete picture of the
mechanism of PP2A autodephosphorylation remains to be
elucidated. In addition to the regulation of PP2A activity by the
modification of catalytic subunits, it has also been reported that
PP2A activity can be regulated by the modification of regulatory
subunits. Various kinases including extracellular signal-regulated
kinase, protein kinase A, and calcein-AM kinase II have been shown
to phosphorylate PP2A regulatory subunits (39–43). Our data show
that AMPK phosphorylates Ser298 and Ser336 residues of the B56g
isoform. Among B56 subunits, B56a has no AMPK consensus site,
and B56h has no consensus site corresponding to Ser298 residue of
B56g isoform. Moreover, the level of B56h expression is much lower
than that of other subunits in MDA-MB-231 cells (Supplementary
Fig. S3). This may explain why knockdown of B56a and B56h does
not markedly affect adiponectin-mediated increase of PP2A activity
(Fig. 4C). In addition to AMPK sites, B56g has additional
phosphorylation sites that could be simultaneously phosphorylated. Elucidating the effect of multiple phosphorylations by various
kinases on B56 isoforms will be important for understanding the
physiologic role of PP2A as a signal integrator of various stimuli,
including growth factors and nutrients in different cellular
contexts. Several reports support the tumor-suppressive role of
the B56g isoform. Overexpression of B56g partially reverses the

tumorigenic phenotype of lung cancer cells (26) and reduces the
abundance of h-catenin protein through inhibition of APC-axin
formation, leading to destabilization of the h-catenin protein (44).
B56g1- and B56g3-containing PP2A holoenzymes also directly
dephosphorylate p53 at Thr55, leading to the inhibition of cell
proliferation and transformation (20). The work presented here
lends additional support to a tumor-suppressive role of B56g by
showing that adiponectin-activated AMPK phosphorylates B56g,
leading to the reactivation of the tumor suppressor PP2A, which in
turn reduces the metastasis of breast tumor cells.
In summary, we show for the first time that adiponectinactivated AMPK directly phosphorylates a B56g regulatory subunit,
leading to the activation of PP2A, and that AMPK-activated PP2A is
required to suppress AKT. Therefore, we propose that reactivation
of PP2A tumor suppressor activity by adiponectin is a promising
novel therapeutic strategy for treating cancer.
