BACKGROUND: Scarce systematic trial data have prevented uniform therapeutic guidelines for T-cell prolymphocytic leukemia (TPLL). A central need in this historically refractory tumor is the controlled evaluation of multiagent chemotherapy and its combination
with the currently most active single agent, alemtuzumab. METHODS: This prospective multicenter phase 2 trial assessed response,
survival, and toxicity of a novel regimen in previously treated (n ¼ 9) and treatment-naive (n ¼ 16) patients with T-PLL. Induction by
fludarabine, mitoxantrone, and cyclophosphamide (FMC), for up to 4 cycles, was followed by alemtuzumab (A) consolidation, up to
12 weeks. RESULTS: Of the 25 patients treated with FMC, 21 subsequently received alemtuzumab. Overall response rate to FMC was
68%, comprising 6 complete remissions (all bone-marrow confirmed) and 11 partial remissions. Alemtuzumab consolidation increased
the intent-to-treat overall response rate to 92% (12 complete remissions; 11 partial remissions). Median overall survival after FMC-A
was 17.1 months and median progression-free survival was 11.9 months. Progression-free survival tended to be shorter for patients
with high-level T-cell leukemia 1 oncoprotein expression. Hematologic toxicities were the most frequent grade 3/4 side effects under
FMC-A. Exclusively in the 21 alemtuzumab-consolidated patients, 13 cytomegalovirus reactivations were observed; 9 of these 13 represented a clinically relevant infection. CONCLUSIONS: FMC-A is a safe and efficient protocol in T-PLL, which compares favorably to

INTRODUCTION
T-cell prolymphocytic leukemia (T-PLL) is the most frequent mature T-cell leukemia in Western countries. Patients typically present with markedly elevated and exponentially rising leukocyte counts along with splenomegaly, lymphadenopathy, hepatomegaly, skin lesions, or effusions.1 T-PLL is commonly associated with genomic aberrations involving
chromosomes 14, 8, or 11.2 Rearrangements at the 14q32.1 region, found in the majority of cases, lead to abnormally
high and protracted expression of the T-cell leukemia 1 (TCL1) oncogene.3,4
T-PLL shows a marked resistance to conventional chemotherapy. Only 30% to 45% of patients primarily respond
to alkylating agents, including CHOP (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, prednisone), and slightly improved

results are noted for purine nucleoside analogs such as
pentostatin or fludarabine.5 Furthermore, notoriously
early relapses are poorly controlled by conventional second-line chemotherapies. As a result, patients with T-PLL
generally have a dismal prognosis with a fraction of < 5%
surviving 5 years.3,4 Therefore, novel therapeutic options
and optimizations of available modalities are urgently
needed. However, due to the low disease incidence, data
from systematic, especially prospective, trials as a basis for
informed treatment decisions are extremely rare.
Alemtuzumab (A) has demonstrated response rates
of 50% to 75% and is considered the most active single
agent in T-PLL.6-8 Data from chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), although only distantly related to T-PLL, implicate that when added to fludarabine, alemtuzumab can
synergistically improve response rates,9,10 or overcome
fludarabine resistance.11 A response benefit of cyclophosphamide in combination with fludarabine is firmly established,12 and favorable results have been also reported for
fludarabine plus cyclophosphamide combined with
mitoxantrone (FMC) in patients with relapsed/refractory
CLL.13,14
On the basis of these data and the central question
whether a multiagent chemotherapy regimen can add
benefit to single alemtuzumab in the treatment of T-PLL,
we investigated the efficacy and safety of FMC followed
by alemtuzumab (FMC-A) in T-PLL. The sequential
design enabled us to separately assess the fludarabinebased chemotherapy component prior to alemtuzumab.
In this first prospective trial of a combined polychemotherapy-plus-immunotherapy designed for T-PLL, we
report a very favorable efficacy and toxicity profile of the
FMC-A regimen.

Group performance status (ECOG PS) of 0-3, and  2
prior treatments. Patients who had received pretreatment
with fludarabine alone or in combination with cyclophosphamide or mitoxantrone as well as pretreatment with
alemtuzumab were not included. Additional exclusion criteria included human immunodeficiency virus infection
and Coombs-positive, active hemolysis. All patients gave
written informed consent according to local guidelines.
Tumor samples were obtained in adherence to the Declaration of Helsinki.
Treatment Schedule

Patients initially received 2 cycles of FMC consisting of
fludarabine phosphate given at 25 mg/m2 per day intravenously (iv) on days 1 through 3, mitoxantrone at 8 mg/m2
per day iv on day 1, and cyclophosphamide at 200 mg/m2
per day iv on days 1 through 3 to be repeated on day 28.
Patients showing response at restaging after 2 cycles were
scheduled to receive 2 additional FMC cycles up to a total
of 4 and were given alemtuzumab within 1 to 3 months
after FMC completion. Patients with stable disease (SD)
or those who progressed after 2 cycles of FMC received
alemtuzumab immediately. Alemtuzumab was administered iv at 3 mg on day 1. If well-tolerated, the dose was
escalated to 10 mg on day 2 and to 30 mg on day 3, with
all 3 doses as infusion for 2 hours. All patients then
received alemtuzumab at 30 mg iv 3 times weekly as consolidation for a maximum of 12 weeks. Patients received
an oral Pneumocystis jiroveci prophylaxis (trimethoprim at
800 mg/sulfamethoxazole at 160 mg twice daily [bid] 3
times/week) and a herpesvirus prophylaxis (valacyclovir at
500 mg bid) starting at chemotherapy initiation. Weekly
cytomegalovirus (CMV) monitoring was recommended.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Tumor Cell Analysis at Study Inclusion

Eligibility Criteria

Besides standard immunophenotypic panels (above),
expression of TCL1 protein in leukemic cells isolated
from peripheral blood was evaluated before treatment initiation by Western blot and/or flow cytometry as
described.3,4 T-PLL cells were isolated by Ficoll-Paque
Plus (GE Healthcare) centrifugation. The aberrant clone
comprised at least 80% of WBC as indicated by flow
cytometry. For semiquantitative estimation of TCL1
expression, densitometric data (ImageJ software; National
Institutes of Health) from scanned blots were normalized
to glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH,
1:500; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or b-actin (1:2000;
Sigma-Aldrich) expression. An established fluorescence in
situ hybridization (FISH) probe set detected defined chromosomal aberrations.16

This open-label, nonrandomized, phase 2 trial recruited
from 23 centers throughout Germany and Austria during
November 2001 to February 2007. It included patients
with a confirmed diagnosis of T-PLL based on World
Health Organization criteria.3,15 For that, clinical data,
laboratory features, cytomorphology, cytogenetics, and
immunophenotyping were integrated. The latter had to
include both an informative immunophenotype3,4 as
determined by flow cytometry from peripheral blood as
well as an unequivocal decision by a panel of reference
pathologists based on the initial bone marrow (BM) biopsies taken from all patients.

Evaluation of Treatment Response

Response criteria followed those of the National Cancer
Institute–sponsored Working Group on CLL.17 Beyond
that, we more stringently defined here a complete remission (CR) at any stage of treatment as follows: no signs of
organ infiltration or lymph node enlargements as per careful physical examination and ultrasound studies as well as
a normalized lymphocyte count, and in addition, confirmation of lack of an aberrant T-cell population by a BM
biopsy with immunohistochemical evaluation by a panel
of reference pathologists; detection thereof, but fulfillment of all other CR-criteria resulted in the designation of
‘‘partial remission’’ (PR). Continuous molecular (polymerase chain reaction [PCR]-based) minimal residual disease monitoring as well as flow cytometry on the BM
aspirates were not uniformly performed. However, for all
CRs they were a requirement to be inconspicuous. In
addition to the published recommendations,17 response
assessment included computed tomography (CT) scans in
76% of patients; 5 with both thoracic and abdominal
scans, 6 with only thoracic, and 8 with only abdominal
scans.
Statistical Methods

Following an intent-to-treat (ITT) principle, primary
study endpoints were response rate, number of severe
adverse events, and number of life-threatening infections.
Secondary endpoints included progression-free survival
(PFS) and overall survival (OS). OS was measured from
the time of trial inclusion, as done in most other series
(Table 3 ), and PFS was recorded from the time of FMC
initiation until event or last follow up. The Kaplan-Meier
method was used for the analysis of time-to-event.
RESULTS
Patient Characteristics

During November 2001 through February 2007, a total
of 25 eligible patients entered the study. Their major presenting features and baseline tumor cell characteristics are
summarized in Table 1. The median age was 66 years
(range, 36-78 years) with a total of 5 patients (20%) aged
more than 70 years. A comorbidity scoring was not protocol procedure. ECOG PS at trial entry was  2 in 26% of
patients. As the most common disease-specific characteristic, all patients presented with elevated leukocyte counts
(median 120,000/lL). In addition to a thorough physical
examination, imaging procedures as initial staging and as
follow-up included a CT scan in 12 patients as well as
chest x-ray and ultrasound studies in 13 patients. The median size of enlarged lymph nodes (in 15 patients) was 2.3

histologically confirmed. No other extranodal/extramedullary manifestations, eg, in liver or lung, including pleural effusions were reported.
Sixteen patients (64%) received FMC as their firstline therapy, whereas 9 of 25 (36%) had received various
prior therapies such as low-dose prednisone (1 of 25; SD),
cytarabine (1 of 25; no response [NR]), vincristine (1 of
25; SD), single course of cyclophosphamide (1 of 25;
PR), single course of cyclophosphamide with prednisone
(1 of 25; PR), single course of CHOP (1 of 25; progressive
disease [PD]), 6 CHOP (1 of 25; PR), 4 cycles of 20 chlorodeoxyadenosine (2-CdA; 1 of 25; NR), and leukapheresis (1 of 25; SD). Except for the 2 patients who either had previously received 4  2-CdA or 6 CHOP
and who had to recover prior to inclusion, all other
patients entered the study immediately after their single
course of the aforementioned ineffective therapies.
Treatment Exposure

A total of 90 cumulative FMC cycles with a median of 4
cycles (range, 1-5 cycles) per patient were administered;
one patient received 5 cycles FMC. A total of 133 weeks
of alemtuzumab at the 3  30 mg level were administered.
The median time between last FMC and start of alemtuzumab consolidation was 35 days (range, 16-116 days).
Median duration of alemtuzumab therapy was 5 weeks
(range, 2-14 weeks). The median total dose of alemtuzumab was 343 mg (range, 6-1033 mg). The duration of
alemtuzumab consolidation was as follows: at least 12
weeks (one with 14 weeks) in 5 (24%) patients; 7, 6, and
5 weeks in 2 (9.5%) patients each; 4 weeks in 7 (33%)
patients; 3 weeks in 1 (5%) patient; and 2 weeks in 2
(9.5%) patients. Reasons for premature (< 12 weeks) and
permanent termination of alemtuzumab consolidation in
these 16 patients were: isolated prolonged leukopenia
(n ¼ 3) and thrombocytopenia (n ¼ 3), or their combination (n ¼ 3), or in association with CMV reactivation
(n ¼ 6), and myocardial infarction (n ¼ 1). Four patients
did not receive alemtuzumab after FMC: 1 of them was
excluded from the study after 2 cycles of FMC due to adenoma of the pituitary gland, 1 patient did not receive
alemtuzumab consolidation in CR at the discretion of the
local investigator, 1 patient was referred to allogeneic
blood stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT) while in CR,
and 1 experienced PD with early death (see Fig. 1A).
Treatment Response and Survival

Treatments were initiated after a median of 1.6 months after
diagnosis, which was not significantly different between
therapy-naive versus previously treated patients (P ¼ .803;
Table 1). The overall response rate (ORR) to FMC inducCancer

June 15, 2013

tion was 68% (17 of 25 patients: 6 CR, 11 PR; Fig. 1A). A
total of 21 patients went on to receive alemtuzumab consolidation of which 95% (20 patients) achieved a CR or a PR,
increasing the ORR to 92% (23 of 25 patients) in an ITT
analysis (12 CR, 11 PR) and eliminating the statistical tendency (P ¼ .054) of more frequent major responses in the
treatment-naive subset than in pretreated patients after
FMC induction. Four of the 6 patients in confirmed CR as
determined by BM immunohistochemistry, flow cytometry, and PCR-based analysis after FMC remained in such a
CR after alemtuzumab; the other 2 did not receive further
consolidation for reasons indicated in the section above on
‘‘Treatment Exposure.’’ Ten of 11 patients with PR after
FMC received alemtuzumab consolidation; of these, 3
improved to CR and 7 remained in PR. Of the 6 patients
with SD after FMC, 3 achieved a CR and 3 improved to a
PR with alemtuzumab. Only 1 patient in PD after 2 courses
FMC immediately received alemtuzumab, but the disease
continued to progress. One patient progressed under FMC
before administration of alemtuzumab.
At database closure in November 2009, after a median observation time of 37 months, 5 patients were alive
(absolute survival range of 2.7-60.4 months). Twenty
patients had died, 18 due to PD, 1 of secondary malignancy, and 1 of potential treatment toxicity (see below).
Median PFS for all 25 patients was 11.9 months (95%
confidence interval [CI] ¼ 9.3-14.6; Fig. 1B), remaining
the same when the small number of 4 patients who did
not receive alemtuzumab consolidation was excluded.
Median PFS was 12.9 months for patients in CR as compared with 10.4 months for patients achieving a PR as
their best response after FMC-A or at least FMC (4 cases).
Median OS was 17.1 months (95% CI ¼ 12.1-22.1
months; Fig. 1B) for all patients and did not markedly differ between the response groups of CR and PR (19.2 versus 17.1 months, respectively). There were no significant
differences in ORR, OS, and PFS between the subsets of
previously treated versus treatment-naive patients or
according to the time from diagnosis to trial entry. As for
survival (above), there also was no difference in major
response durations between the small subcohorts of
patients according to alemtuzumab consolidation
(P ¼ .964): 18.9 months for the 4 without any alemtuzumab, 18.8 months for those 16 with less than 12 weeks of
consolidating alemtuzumab, and 20.8 months for the 5
patients with full-schedule consolidation.
Adverse Events

Relevant events were counted on a single-event cumulative
basis. Mild toxicities were common. For FMC, there were

34 events of grade 1/2 leukocytopenia and 32 events of grade
1/2 thrombocytopenia. Grade 1/2 nonhematological toxicity under FMC included 1 episode each of peripheral limb
ischemia, peripheral edema, and arthralgia. After administration of alemtuzumab, early (< 24 hours from infusion)
grade 1/2 side effects were skin reactions and chills (4 cases
each). Late, non–infusion-related minor toxicities after alemtuzumab were nonmalignant pleural effusion (n ¼ 1), minor
bleedings (n ¼ 2), vertigo (n ¼ 2), oral mucositis (n ¼ 2),
and mild (local) infections (n ¼ 5). A total of 6 grade 1/2
cytopenias after alemtuzumab were recorded.

Overall, severe (grade 3/4 or 5) non–CMV-related
side effects were recorded as 59 and 76 for the FMC and
A part, respectively (Table 2). Hematological toxicity was
the predominant event in both the FMC and the A component. Granulocytopenias accounted for 10% of the cumulative overall grade 3/4 events after FMC and for 16%
after alemtuzumab. In an individual-patient–based analysis, neutropenia of grade 3/4 was observed in 12 of 25
(48%) of all patients, in 5 patients during induction phase
with FMC, and in 7 patients during subsequent alemtuzumab consolidation. Grade 3/4 thrombocytopenias

increased from 12 events under FMC to 15 events under
alemtuzumab. When attempting to attribute toxicities to
alemtuzumab exclusively, one has to consider the carryover by the FMC component into the consolidation
phase. Therefore, we analyzed hematological toxicities in
3 subsets of patients with respect to the number of weeks
of alemtuzumab administration, including those patients
receiving no alemtuzumab at all as a reference (see supplemental table S1). There was no significant difference in
the rate of toxicities between these (small-sized) groups.
None of the 4 patients receiving FMC alone experienced a
side effect of neutropenia of grade 3/4.
A total of 8 non–CMV-related systemic infections/
pneumonia were observed. All 5 events during FMC were
observed without neutropenia; the 3 events during alemtuzumab were associated with neutropenia of Common
Toxicity Criteria grade 3/4. The mostly toxicity-related
reasons for discontinuation of alemtuzumab consolidation are indicated in the section above on ‘‘Treatment
Exposure.’’
CMV reactivations were observed in 13 patients and
were confined to the subset of those who received alemtuzumab (see supplemental table S2). Although 4 patients
were asymptomatic, 9 patients had a clinically apparent
CMV infection mostly presenting with fever. One patient
developed a febrile CMV pneumonitis about 6 months after alemtuzumab cessation, which required hospitalization with ventilator assistance and treatment with
gancyclovir and anti-CMV immunoglobulin G with subsequent full recovery. Overall, in 9 of 25 (36%) patients, a
Cancer

June 15, 2013

grade 3/4 CMV-related infection was observed, all during
the alemtuzumab phase; in 7 of these, it was associated
with neutropenia. It is thus conceivable that the clinical
relevance of the grade 3/4 neutropenia during alemtuzumab might be influenced by the previous treatment with
FMC.
Overall, 2 patients died during therapy for reasons
unrelated to PD: 1 from secondary cancer and 1 from cardiac arrest. The latter was potentially directly related to
therapy. This patient experienced symptomatic coronary
heart disease after the third FMC cycle and received a
fourth cycle of FMC resulting in a PR. During subsequent
alemtuzumab consolidation, the patient experienced a
supraventricular tachycardia following the first administration of 3 mg alemtuzumab iv, but recovered and
received a second dose. However, after the administration
of the third dose, the patient went into cardiac arrest and
died. No autopsy was done. The patient’s history revealed
the presence of diabetes mellitus and coronary heart disease at the time of study entry, but the severity of disease
was not deemed sufficient for study exclusion.
Patients With Prolonged Survival

Seven (28%) patients survived longer than a much-cited
30-month period (see supplemental table S3).3,4,7 Their
PFS and OS were 24.1-60.4 months (median, 37.6
months) and 30.5-60.4 months (median, 49.6 months),
respectively. At last follow-up, 4 of them were still alive,
with 2 in CR and 2 in PR. Only 2 of them had therapy
prior to FMC-A, namely prednisone and 4  2-CdA.
Post–FMC-A management of these 7 long-term survivors
was as follows (none received FMC as retherapy): no further therapy (n ¼ 2), alemtuzumab (n ¼ 3) or bendamustin (n ¼ 1) at first relapse, and allo-SCT after salvage of
PD (n ¼ 1). This last patient was, at last follow-up, alive
at 22.1 months after SCT (OS, 59.7 months). Overall,
allo-SCT was performed in 5 of 25 patients (in 3 at first

one of them was a long-term responder with an OS of

the observation period.
FISH and TCL1 Oncoprotein Analysis

FISH analysis revealed the characteristic prevalence of
chromosomal aberrations (Table 1), of which none
showed a significant correlation with presenting features,
treatment response, or survival. In 72% of patients, the
typical chromosome 14 abnormalities were detectable.

positive, 1 negative) confirmed that the sources of the
TCL1 signals were T cells. One additional case was categorized as TCL1-positive based on flow cytometry only.
Categorized according to TCL1 intensity (densitometric
cutoff of > 0.5 TCL1/b-actin), the presence of TCL1
protein at high levels was detected in 12 of 20 (60%) of
samples, which was associated with shorter PFS in
response to FMC-A (10.6 versus 24.8 months median in
TCL1-negative cases, P ¼ .05; Fig. 2). TCL1 was detected
at any levels in 17 of 21 (81%) cases. Thus, weak TCL1
protein expression (ratio < 0.5 by Western blot and a
small [< 20%] population of TCL1-positive cells) was
found in 4 patients. Similar to previous findings,18 there
were discordances between detectable TCL1 rearrangements and protein expression. We found among the 8
TCL1-dim/negative cases (Western blot category) 4 cases
with 14q32 region rearrangements by FISH. In 2 patients
with strong TCL1 expression in tumor cells, there was no
14q32 locus aberration.
DISCUSSION
Mostly due to its low incidence, very few controlled trials
have been published on T-PLL. The discouraging results
of CHOP as initial therapy and the heterogeneous
descriptions of experimental salvage approaches demonstrated that better regimens for T-PLL are urgently
needed.5 Information on the efficacy of novel front-line
protocols is often only available from small and/or retro2264

spective series. In this study, we sought to address the activity of FMC polychemotherapy with alemtuzumab in
T-PLL in a prospective multicenter phase 2 trial. We present encouraging data from FMC induction followed by
alemtuzumab consolidation in 25 patients, in which an
ORR of 68% to FMC was increased to 92% after alemtuzumab, and in which response duration is improved over
historical series.
Table 3 summarizes efficacy data of published series.
A first improvement over CHOP-based protocols came
with the introduction of purine analogs, of which deoxycoformycin (DCF, pentostatin) became the best-studied,19,20 but with single-fludarabine showing activity as
well.21 Alemtuzumab was later impressively demonstrated
to be superior to DCF in response induction, even when
applied in the second-line setting, including in DCF failures.6 Subsequently, single-agent alemtuzumab induced
an ORR of 76% in 39 pretreated T-PLL patients7 and a
51% ORR in 76 relapsed patients from a multicentric
program.8 Although many relapsed patients can achieve a
second CR after repeated alemtuzumab, it became
obvious that even these improvements did not broadly
translate into long-term remissions. Combinations of
alemtuzumab with simultaneous DCF did not seem to
produce significant increases of ORR and survival in pretreated patients over alemtuzumab alone.22
Fittingly, Dearden et al report on an ORR of 91%
following single iv administration of alemtuzumab in

their subset of previously untreated patients.23 Although
data on alemtuzumab duration in this cohort were not
indicated, their ORR compares to our 92% ORR. The
higher CR/PR ratio in their study (81%/10% versus
48%/44% in this study) is likely due to our very stringent
requirement of a trephine-biopsy confirmed CR. Followup times differ between both series, and the seemingly
slight superiority of the FMC-A survival data has to be
carefully adjusted for toxicities in order to derive the most
ideal scheduling of alemtuzumab and a chemotherapy
component. A very important message from the study by
Dearden et al is that the iv route of alemtuzumab is superior to its sc administration.23
In light of the few comparable studies, our data overall indicate that FMC polychemotherapy may add to historical response rates and also may provide a survival
benefit (Table 3) without increasing toxicity (see below).
However, critically, FMC may also compromise the intensity of subsequent alemtuzumab and trials of optimized scheduling/dosing (ie, concomitant FMC-A) will
have to address this limitation. Cautions also have to be
raised when comparing a limited number of mostly small,
nonuniform (eg, extent of pretreatment, length of followup), single-center, and nonrandomized series. In our
study 16 patients (64%) were treatment-naive and a substantial proportion of our pretreated patients received
rather mild cytoreductive regimens prior to study inclusion (see Results section) for reasons of temporarily
reduced performance status and bridging towards trial
entry. In our series, both median PFS (11.9 months) and
OS (17.1 months, measured here from the time of trial
inclusion as in most published series) for the whole group
showed no differences between the CR and PR subsets of
Cancer

June 15, 2013

major responses and also no differences between the previously treated versus treatment-naive cohort. A limiting
factor in interpreting this is the naturally low sample size.
However, although our results could indicate that FMCA produces high and slightly more durable responses irrespective of a prior therapy other than fludarabine or alemtuzumab, it remains a concern that the majority of
patients eventually relapse, regardless of the quality of
response. This is in agreement with the 2 largest series of
the alemtuzumab era.7,8 Taking these and our data together, the median duration of a response after alemtuzumab with or without chemotherapy can currently be
estimated to be less than 1 year. This urgently calls for
more efficient first-line strategies as well as for improved
consolidation.
There are patients with T-PLL who have long-lasting remissions or extended survival. Dearden et al
reported 9 previously treated patients (23%) who were
alive at 29 months after alemtuzumab monotherapy.7 A
certain added benefit to an alemtuzumab backbone by
high-dose therapy, in particular with allo-SCT, is implicated (ie, median OS improvement from 20 to 33
months) in response-selected patients.24 In our series, 7
(28%) patients show durable responses and long-term OS
of 30.5 to 60.4 months (median, 49.6 months) (see supplemental table S3). This was associated with off-protocol
allo-SCT in only 1 patient. Although it is unclear whether
this added survival is attributable to the FMC component
versus patient selection or SCT toxicity, our data strongly
indicate that a substantial patient subset, that is yet to be
better defined, responds durably even without intensified
SCT protocols. This might be a reflection of a biologically
more indolent or treatment-sensitive disease. It is
2265

Original Article

therefore important to define underlying strata already at
diagnosis to discern and assign the remainder of patients
to allo-SCT protocols.25 Because there are initially
chronic courses in T-PLL, a central question to be
addressed in this context is the individually most optimal
timing of treatment initiation.
Although TCL1 oncoprotein expression was associated here with differences in PFS, it likely is not the only
determinant of a more aggressive or refractory course.
However, among currently accessible clinical and molecular parameters, it has shown its superior value as a marker
for a prognostically poorer, more proliferative, subset of
cases and is, in concert with cytogenetic/FISH data, also a
highly valuable tool to differentiate T-PLL from other
leukemic T-cell tumors.3,4
FMC-A has limited side effects, which are comparable in incidence and severity to other studies using alemtuzumab combinations in T-PLL and CLL.7,8 As expected,
the vast majority of patients here experienced leukopenias/neutropenias and thrombocytopenias. Both, asymptomatic CMV reactivations and clinically relevant CMV
infections were observed (Table 2 and supplemental table
S2). This corresponds to the usual toxicity seen with alemtuzumab and warrants regular CMV monitoring and preemptive therapy.26 Grade 3/4 hematologic toxicity and
CMV reactivation were the major reasons for early alemtuzumab cessation. It is conceivable that the FMC component contributes to the tendency of a slightly higher
toxicity of subsequent alemtuzumab treatment, with
respect to symptomatic neutropenias or the clinical severity of CMV reactivations.
One patient of this study suffering from preexisting
coronary heart disease died following a cardiac arrest after
receiving the third dose of alemtuzumab. There is
reported significant cardiac toxicity under alemtuzumab,
for example, in conjunction with FCD chemotherapy in 2
of 37 (5.2%) patients with peripheral T-cell lymphoma27
or as monotherapy in 4 of 8 (50%) patients with Sézary
syndrome.28 In the latter study, these patients had no previous history of cardiac disease, but were pretreated with
an anthracyclin. Our patient received no therapy prior to
FMC-A. In similar patient collectives, however, alemtuzumab induced no such events.7,8,23 Mechanistic explanations for cardiac adverse events following alemtuzumab
are provided by a cytokine release syndrome or a myocardial dysfunction in association or independent of ischemia, ie, via lysis of normal or malignant T cells infiltrating
the heart.29,30 We conclude that cardiac toxicity after
alemtuzumab therapy, although very rare, is a concern
and requires stringent risk evaluation at study inclusion
2266

and tight monitoring, especially with preexisting cardiac
conditions and combinations of chemotherapy plus alemtuzumab. It is unresolved to which extent the treated disease itself, cardiac comorbidity, and substance
combinations (ie, anthracyclins, fludarabine) play a role
in alemtuzumab-associated cardiac toxicity.
In conclusion, FMC-A is a feasible treatment regimen for T-PLL with an efficacy that compares favorably
to historic data. However, despite an ORR of 92%, one of
the highest response rates reported so far, the duration of
remission and the median OS of 17.1 months still remain
just marginally better than in comparable series. This
emphasizes the urgent need for efforts on optimizing the
efficacy of T cell–active compounds and on betterinformed stratifications for SCT.25
