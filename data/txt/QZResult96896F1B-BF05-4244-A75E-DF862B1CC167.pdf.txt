BACKGROUND: High-dose cytarabine (HiDAC) is safe and very effective in younger patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML), but it generally is not well tolerated in the elderly. METHODS: The authors explored the safety and tolerability of a modified HiDAC induction regimen consisting of 6 daily doses of cytarabine at 2 g/m2 in combination
with 3 daily doses of daunorubicin at 45 mg/m2 in 59 consecutive patients aged >60 years who had de novo AML
diagnosed between July 1996 and February 2005. RESULTS: The median patient age was 68 years (range, 60-86
years). The regimen was well tolerated. Infections were common and occurred in 39% of patients, but cerebellar toxicities occurred in only 7% of patients and were reversible. The day-30 induction-related mortality rate was 10%. Overall, 69% of patients achieved complete remissions (CR), and 80% received up to 3 consolidations with HiDAC. The
median follow-up for surviving patients was 53 months (range, 17-114 months). The median overall survival was 15.3
months (range, 1-114 months), and the relapse-free survival was 13.8 months (range, 1-113 months). Survival for
patients who achieved CR was 27 months (range, 2-114 months). CONCLUSIONS: The modified HiDAC regimen was
well tolerated in patients aged >60 years with AML and was associated with low induction mortality and high rates
of CR. Nevertheless, these high remissions still were associated with poor overall outcomes. Cancer 2012;118:428–33.

The incidence of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) increases with age.1 In the United States, the median age of patients

with AML is 67 years at diagnosis, and the age-adjusted incidence is 15.9 per 100,000 for those aged >65 years compared
with 1.7 per 100,000 for those aged <65 years (Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results data, 2003-2007).1 Outcomes in older patients (aged >60 years) are poor because of chemotherapy-related toxicity and inherent, resistant
disease.2 Indeed, it is estimated that the median overall survival (OS) of patients with AML aged >65 is months, and
the 2-year survival rate is <10%.3
The achievement of complete remission (CR) appears to be a prerequisite to long-term survival.4 However, the
degree of toxicity to which patients should be subjected to achieve CR remains a topic of debate. Ongoing clinical trials
are incorporating comorbidity scores to assist in this complex decision.5-7
High-dose cytarabine (HiDAC)-containing regimens are effective and well tolerated in younger patients with AML8
but generally are poorly tolerated in patients aged >60 years.9-12 Estey et al reported less neurotoxicity using intermediate
dose cytarabine (500 mg/m2 every 12 hours for 9-25 doses).13 In an attempt to reduce HiDAC-related toxicities and

preserve antileukemic activity in this patient population,
we tested the safety and efficacy of a modified HiDAC
regimen in which cytarabine was administered daily at 2
g/m2 per dose for 6 consecutive days. This report focuses
on the safety and tolerability of this regimen in patients
with de novo AML aged 60 years.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients
The patient population consisted of adults aged 60 years
with histologically confirmed and previously untreated
AML who were referred for induction chemotherapy at
Emory University between June 1996 and February
2005. Patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia were
excluded. Repeat bone marrow biopsy or institutional
review of outside material was performed for all patients
who were diagnosed at another institution. The diagnosis
of AML initially was defined according to the FrenchAmerican-British Cooperative Group14 and, later,
according to the World Health Organization classification: ie, documentation of 20% myeloid blasts in blood
or bone marrow.15 Patients with secondary AML, defined
by the presence of an antecedent hematologic disorder, or
who had received prior chemotherapy or radiation to treat
a pre-existing malignant or benign condition received alternative regimens and, thus, are not included in this
report. Cytogenetic abnormalities were classified as favorable, intermediate, unfavorable, or unknown according
to South West Oncology Group (SWOG) criteria.16
Patients were either enrolled on or treated according to an
institutional phase 2 clinical trial. This study was
approved by the Emory University Institutional Review
Board.
Treatment
Modified HiDAC induction therapy consisted of 2
planned courses of intravenous cytarabine given at a dose
of 2 g/m2 daily over 4 hours for 6 consecutive days in
combination with 3 days of daunorubicin (45 mg/m2)
administered on days 2 through 4. Patients without blast
clearance based on the day-14 bone marrow biopsy (>5%
blasts in bone marrow with >15% cellularity) received
the second induction course beginning between days 15
and 22 or after resolution of nonhematologic toxicities
from the first induction. Patients who achieved CR after 1
cycle received the second course upon recovery of counts
and resolution of toxicities from the first course of therapy. Patients who did not achieve CR after 2 inductions

were offered alternative therapies. All patients who
achieved CR after induction received a first HiDAC and
daunorubicin consolidation followed by risk-adapted
consolidation. Patients who were considered unfit for
transplantation and those who had favorable cytogenetics
received 2 courses of HiDAC at 2 g/m2 intravenously
daily for 6 consecutive days. Fit patients with intermediate-risk cytogenetics were offered an autograft; those with
unfavorable cytogenetics and a suitable donor underwent
allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.
Patients received supportive care according to institutional standards. Patients’ demographic data (age, sex),
disease-related information (histology, white blood cell
[WBC] count at diagnosis, cytogenetics), response to
therapy, bone marrow biopsy results at days 14 and 30,
relapse, and survival information were collected.
Response Criteria and Statistical Methods
Disease status was assessed using criteria developed by a
workshop sponsored by the National Cancer Institute and
revised by the International Working Group.17 CR was
defined as the recovery of counts (absolute neutrophil
count 1000/mcL and platelet count 100,000/mcL)
with a normocellular bone marrow and <5% blasts.
Relapse-free survival (RFS) was calculated from the date
of remission to the date of relapse, last contact, or death.
OS was calculated from the time of diagnosis to the time
of death or last contact. RFS and OS were estimated by
using the Kaplan-Meier method. A Cox proportionalhazards model was used to estimate the unadjusted and
adjusted effects of prognostic factors (age, cytogenetics,
presenting leukocyte count, and the number of comorbidities) on RFS and OS. The significance level was set at P
¼ .05 for all analyses. The SAS statistical package (version
9.2; (SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, NC) was used for data
management and all statistical analyses.

RESULTS
Patient Characteristics
Between July 1996 and February 2005, 59 consecutive
patients aged 60 years with newly diagnosed, previously
untreated, de novo AML received modified HiDAC
induction chemotherapy as described above. The median
patients age was 68 years (range, 60-86 years), and 20
patients (34%) were aged >70 years. Cytogenetic abnormalities were favorable in 7% of patients, intermediate in
61%, unfavorable in 25%, and unknown in 7% (Table
1). The median leukocyte (WBC) count at presentation

55 of 59 patients (93%) and are listed in Table 2.
Safety and Tolerability
Regimen-related toxicities are listed in Table 3. Infection
was the most common toxicity (39%) and led to the death
of 4 patients during induction and 4 during consolidation. Central nervous system toxicity, including cerebellar
toxicity (n ¼ 4) and bleed or stroke (n ¼ 2), occurred during induction in 6 of 59 patients (10%). Cerebellar ataxia
was reversible in all patients. Six patients (10%) died by
day 30, and 5 patients died between days 30 and 60, for a
60-day mortality rate of 19%. Day-30 and day-60 mortality rates were not affected by age; specifically, no difference was observed between patients aged <70 years or
>70 years. Causes of death by day 60 included sepsis (4
patients), pneumonia (2 patients), intracranial hemorrhage or stroke (2 patients), and progressive disease (3
patients).
Efficacy
Overall, 41 of 59 patients (69%) achieved CR after 1
induction (n ¼ 36; 88%) or 2 inductions (n ¼ 5; 12%).
Eighteen patients with primary resistant disease received
alternative therapies and died. Of the patients who
achieved first CR postinduction, 33 of 41 (80%) received

or 3 courses (n ¼ 10) of HiDAC, and 6 underwent hematopoietic stem cell transplantation in first CR (5 autologous and 1 allogeneic, matched-sibling donor
transplantation). The remaining 8 patients in first CR did

Survival
The median follow-up for surviving patients was 53
months (range, 17-114 months). Overall, the median survival for the entire cohort was 15.3 months (range, 1-114
months) (Fig. 1), and the median OS for patients who
achieved CR was 27 months (range, 2-114 months). It is
noteworthy that all 4 patients who had favorable cytogenetics achieved remission, and their median survival was
39 months (range, 4-74 months).

Figure 1. This Kaplan-Meier curve illustrates overall survival in
patients aged 60 years with acute myeloid leukemia after
high-dose cytarabine induction.

Figure 2. This Kaplan-Meier curve illustrates recurrence-free
survival in patients aged 60 years with acute myeloid leukemia after high-dose cytarabine induction.

RFS for the entire cohort was 13.8 months (range, 1113 months) (Fig. 2). Among the 23 patients who
relapsed, 15 patients (65%) received salvage therapy with
modified HiDAC (n ¼ 5); azacitidine (n ¼ 2); gemtuzumab ozogamicin (n ¼ 5); etoposide/mitoxantrone (n ¼
1); and combined cytarabine, topotecan, and gemtuzumab
ozogamicin (n ¼ 2); and 5 of 15 patients (33%) achieved a
second CR, including 1 patient w ho underwent allogeneic
hematopoietic stem cell transplantation in second CR.
Prognostic Factors
Univariate analysis indicated that neither age, nor WBC
count, nor cytogenetics was associated with CR; whereas
age influenced RFS, and cytogenetics influenced both
RFS and OS. Cytogenetics independently predicted RFS
and OS in multivariate analyses. The number of comorbidities (0, 1, 2, or >2) did not affect outcomes (Table 4).

DISCUSSION
The treatment of older patients with AML is among the
most challenging dilemmas for hematologists. In addition, currently, there is no commonly accepted standard
of care for this patient population, and there is no reliable
comorbidity scoring system to help identify patients who
may tolerate induction chemotherapy. Low-dose arabinosylcytosine is an accepted standard treatment for older
patients with AML in Europe based on the results from a
randomized trial that demonstrated higher remissions
(18% vs 1%) and improved survival (median, 80 weeks vs
10 weeks) with low-dose arabinosylcytosine compared with
hydroxyurea.4 Previously, Menzin et al reported a median
survival of 7 months for patients who received any type of
‘‘chemotherapy’’ compared with 1 month for those Medicare recipients who received supportive care alone.3
In patients aged 60 years, standard antileukemic
induction chemotherapy (anthracycline plus cytarabine
100-200 mg/m2 daily for 7-10 days) yielded CR rates
ranging between 38% and 48% with a 30% average early
(30-day) mortality rate (Table 5). Given the rising incidence of AML concurrent with the aging population,
recent efforts have focused on developing single agents
(hypomethylating agents, clofarabine, cloretazine) and
reduced-intensity combination regimens.19,20 It is noteworthy that these single-agent regimens have yielded CR
rates and survival comparable to those produced with
combination therapies19 but with lower induction-related
mortality and regimen-related toxicities in this vulnerable
population.
Our single-institution experience with the use of a
modified HiDAC induction for patients with de novo
AML aged 60 years had a high rate of CR with an early
mortality rate of 10% by day 30 and <20% by day 60.
Patients aged >60 years were offered an aggressive regimen based on the subjective impression in the treating
physician that these patients could tolerate intensive
induction. These high remission rates were not affected by
age or cytogenetics and compare favorably with previous
reports (Table 5). A recent report described the outcomes
of patients with AML aged 70 years (median age, 74
years) who received various intensive cytarabine-based
regimens (up to 2 g/m2 daily). In that study, 45% of
patients achieved CR, and OS was 4.6 months. The early
mortality rates were 26% and 36% at 4 weeks and 8
weeks, respectively.11
Despite the presence of comorbidities in 93% of our
patients, the induction mortality was surprisingly low
(10% by day 30 and 19% by day 60) compared with

previous reports in older patients with AML who received
induction chemotherapy. Cerebellar toxicity was a main
concern when this regimen was conceived given a reported
rate of up to 32% by the Cancer and Leukemia Group B
in patients aged >60 years who received HiDAC consolidation.9 In our cohort, 7% of patients developed reversible cerebellar ataxia, which led to discontinuation of
HiDAC in 1 patient. This relatively low incidence may
have been related the to lower cumulative daily doses of
cytarabine in our modified regimen.
In the current study, physician’s subjective impression of the tolerability of this regimen, based on overall
performance status, was the main criteria for enrollment.
Therefore, despite the presence of comorbidities in 93%

432

of patients, patient selection biases may have influenced
the results of this analysis. In addition, modern molecular
prognostic factors, such as fms-related tyrosine kinase 3
and nucleophosmin 1, were not available or known at the
time these patients were treated. These factors may be useful in determining the prognosis for older patients with
AML.21,22
In summary, the modified HiDAC regimen
described in this report was well tolerated in patients aged
>60 years with de novo AML despite the presence of
comorbidities and was associated with high CR rates
(69%). However, these high CR rates were short-lived,
suggesting that alternative consolidations are worth
exploring.
