Management of Patients With HER2-Positive
Metastatic Breast Cancer
Is There an Optimal Sequence of HER2-Directed Approaches?
Amelia B. Zelnak, MD, MSc1; and Kari B. Wisinski, MD2

The successful development of therapies targeting the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) has altered the natural progression of disease among patients with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer. The monoclonal antibody trastuzumab was the first
HER2-directed agent and it was associated with significantly improved outcomes for patients. Subsequently, other HER2-directed
agents such as the monoclonal antibody pertuzumab, the tyrosine kinase receptor inhibitor lapatinib, and the immunoconjugate trastuzumab emtansine were developed to overcome resistance to trastuzumab and provide additional treatment options for patients.
Recent data have demonstrated that the use of these HER2-directed agents improves outcomes. However, with the emergence of
new HER2-targeted agents, the optimal sequencing of treatment remains unclear. Ongoing research is investigating new HER2 combinations, the role of sequencing, novel HER2-directed agents, and combinations with other targeted agents to overcome resistance.

INTRODUCTION
Breast cancer is the most common cancer in women, and the second-leading cause of cancer-related mortality among
women. Despite improvements in early detection and treatment, nearly 40,000 women in the United States were estimated to die of metastatic breast cancer in 2013.1 Among patients diagnosed with breast cancer, approximately 20% will
have overexpression of the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2), a transmembrane tyrosine kinase receptor
that belongs to the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) family. The normal function of HER2 is to regulate cell
growth and survival, as well as adhesion, migration, differentiation, and other cellular responses. HER2 overexpression
was historically associated with a poor clinical outcome.2 However, the addition of HER2-directed therapy has significantly improved the outcomes for patients with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer. This review focuses on the
HER2-directed agents currently available in clinical practice for patients with metastatic disease, and the literature regarding optimal sequencing of these agents.
HER2-Directed Agents
Trastuzumab

Trastuzumab (Herceptin; Genentech, San Francisco, Calif), a humanized monoclonal antibody targeted against HER2,
was to our knowledge the first HER2-directed agent available for use in the treatment of patients with metastatic HER2positive breast cancer.3 Trastuzumab binds to subdomain IV of the extracellular domain of the HER2 receptor. Several
mechanisms of action have been supported by the literature, including antibody-dependent, cell-mediated cytotoxicity;
blocking HER2 cleavage; and inhibiting ligand-independent activation of downstream signaling pathways. The addition
of trastuzumab to taxane-based chemotherapy significantly improved time to disease progression and overall survival
(OS), leading to the approval of trastuzumab for the first-line treatment of patients with metastatic HER2-positive breast
cancer by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 1998.4 Although subjects on the control arm were allowed to
cross over to trastuzumab at the time of disease progression, the median OS was improved from 20.3 months to 25.1

months. The main toxicity associated with trastuzumab
has been an increased risk of symptomatic congestive
heart failure or asymptomatic reductions in left ventricular ejection fraction, as well as a low risk of infusion
reactions.
Despite the clinical success of trastuzumab as a single
agent5 or in combination with chemotherapy6 or endocrine therapy7 in treating first-line metastatic disease,
patients still develop disease progression. Progression may
be caused by the development of resistance to either trastuzumab or to chemotherapy. Continuing treatment with
trastuzumab beyond disease progression in combination
with an alternative chemotherapeutic agent has demonstrated benefit. The German Breast Group (GBG) 26/
Breast International Group (BIG) 03-05 trial compared
capecitabine with capecitabine in combination with trastuzumab in patients with metastatic breast cancer who
had developed disease progression while receiving trastuzumab. Patients were permitted to receive up to 1 line of
therapy in the metastatic setting. The continuation of trastuzumab demonstrated an improvement in the response
rate and progression-free survival (PFS). An OS advantage
was not observed in this trial, possibly due to its closure
before the completion of accrual and the large number of
patients in the control arm who received subsequent
HER2-directed agents.8 Currently, continued HER2directed therapy is considered the standard of care.
Lapatinib

The development of tumor resistance to trastuzumab led
to the development of alternative approaches to block signaling through the HER2 pathway. Lapatinib (Tykerb;
GlaxoSmithKline, London, UK) is an orally active, reversible, dual tyrosine kinase inhibitor of EGFR (HER1) and
HER2. Lapatinib was initially approved by the FDA in
2007 in combination with capecitabine for the treatment
of patients with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer
whose disease progressed while receiving trastuzumabbased chemotherapy. The approval was based on results
from a phase 3 clinical trial that demonstrated that the
addition of lapatinib to capecitabine significantly
improved the median time to disease progression when
compared with capecitabine alone (8.4 months vs 4.4
months; P < .001).9
The MA.31 trialrandomized 652 patients between
lapatinib and trastuzumab in combination with taxanebased therapy in the first-line setting. The median PFS
was inferior in the lapatinib arm compared with the trastuzumab arm (8.8 months vs 11.4 months) (hazards ratio
[HR], 1.33 [95% confidence interval (95% CI), 1.0618

1.67]; P 5 .001).10 Although this first-line study favored
trastuzumab, lapatinib has also been studied in combination with trastuzumab in patients with trastuzumabrefractory metastatic breast cancer. Patients were heavily
pretreated, receiving a median of 3 prior trastuzumab regimens for metastatic disease. The combination of trastuzumab and lapatinib demonstrated improved clinical
benefit (24.7% vs 12.4%; P 5 .01) and PFS compared
with lapatinib alone (12.1 weeks vs 8.1 weeks;
P 5 0.008).11 Longer follow-up also demonstrated a median OS advantage of 4.5 months.12 The most common
adverse events observed with lapatinib were diarrhea, rash,
nausea, vomiting, and fatigue. The incidence of cardiac
toxicity in a pooled analysis of > 3600 patients treated
with lapatinib on 44 clinical trials did not demonstrate a
significant increase in cardiac events compared with control arms (1.6% vs 0.7%).13
Pertuzumab

Pertuzumab (Perjeta; Genentech) is a humanized monoclonal antibody that binds to the extracellular domain of
the HER2 receptor at a different epitope than trastuzumab.14 Activation of the HER2 pathway is initiated by
dimerization of HER2 with other receptors in this family,
such as HER3 and HER1. Although binding of pertuzumab to subdomain II of the HER2 receptor also stimulates antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity, its
synergy with trastuzumab has primarily been demonstrated through its ability to block the potential escape
pathways through HER3/HER2 and HER2/HER2 dimerization.9 The combination of trastuzumab and pertuzumab results in more comprehensive blockade of signaling
through the HER2 pathway, resulting in enhanced antitumor activity in tumor models.15
As a single-agent after disease progression while
receiving trastuzumab-based therapy, pertuzumab has
shown limited clinical activity.16 However, in a phase 2
trial of patients with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer who developed disease progression while receiving
prior trastuzumab-based therapy, the combination of pertuzumab and trastuzumab demonstrated an objective
response rate of 24% and a clinical benefit rate of 50%.
The median PFS was 5.5 months.17 In the first-line setting, the Clinical Evaluation of Pertuzumab and Trastuzumab (CLEOPATRA) study compared the combination
of trastuzumab, pertuzumab, and docetaxel with the use
of trastuzumab and docetaxel alone. The primary endpoint of median PFS was improved from 12.4 months to
18.5 months by the addition of pertuzumab (HR, 0.62;
P < .001).18 OS was also found to be improved, with the

median not yet reached in the pertuzumab arm at the time
of last follow-up and an OS of 37.6 months reported in
the placebo group (HR, 0.66; P 5 .0008).19 It is interesting to note that approximately one-half of the patients in
the study had received no prior adjuvant chemotherapy
and only 10% had received prior adjuvant trastuzumab.
Additional analysis of the CLEOPATRA trial demonstrated a similar magnitude of benefit among patients
receiving pertuzumab, regardless of whether they had previously received (neo)adjuvant trastuzumab.20
Overall, pertuzumab has been reported to be well
tolerated in clinical trials. The observed rates of grade 3 or
greater (National Cancer Institute’s Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version 3.0) diarrhea and
febrile neutropenia were higher in the CLEOPATRA
study compared with the pertuzumab arm. The rate of
asymptomatic or symptomatic left ventricular cardiac dysfunction was not increased by the addition of pertuzumab. Based on the results of the CLEOPATRA trial,
pertuzumab in combination with trastuzumab and docetaxel was approved by the FDA in 2012 for the first-line
treatment of patients with metastatic HER2-positive
breast cancer. The National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines currently recommend the combination of
pertuzumab, trastuzumab, and a taxane as the preferred
regimen for the first-line treatment of patients with
HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer.21
Trastuzumab Emtansine

Trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1) (Kadcyla; Genentech)
is an immunoconjugate that combines trastuzumab with
the microtubule-targeting agent emtansine (DM1; a derivative of maytansine). Trastuzumab is stably linked to DM1
with a nonreducible thioether linker.22 Previously, maytansines had been investigated as potent antimitotic agents,
similar to vinca alkaloids, in the prevention of microtubule
assembly. However, a poor therapeutic window limited
their initial development. This was overcome by conjugation with the monoclonal antibody trastuzumab, thereby
allowing for targeted intracellular drug delivery.23
Early-phase clinical trials of T-DM1 in patients with
HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer whose disease
progressed after treatment with HER2-directed therapy
demonstrated promising clinical activity. A single-arm
phase 2 trial of T-DM1 among 112 patients who had
received a median of 5 prior regimens in the metastatic
setting demonstrated an objective response rate of 25.9%
and a median PFS of 4.6 months.24 In contrast to this
study, in which approximately 60% of patients had
received lapatinib, a phase 2 trial performed among 110
Cancer

January 1, 2015

patients who had received a median of 8.5 prior regimens
including lapatinib demonstrated an objective response
rate of 34.5% and a median PFS of 6.9 months.25
The EMILIA studywas a randomized phase 3 trial
comparing T-DM1 with lapatinib plus capecitabine in
patients with HER2-positive advanced breast cancer who
had received prior treatment with trastuzumab in combination with a taxane. Approximately 61% of patients in the
EMILIA trial had received no lines or 1 line of therapy in
the metastatic setting. Approximately 84% of patients had
received trastuzumab in either the metastatic setting, earlystage setting, or both; 16% of patients had received trastuzumab only in the early-stage setting. The primary endpoint of median PFS was 3.2 months longer in the group
receiving T-DM1 (9.6 months vs 6.4 months; P < .001).
OS was also found to be significantly better with T-DM1
compared with lapatinib plus capecitabine (30.9 months vs
25.1 months; P < .001).26 Based on the positive results of
the EMILIA trial, T-DM1 was approved by the FDA in
2013 for the treatment of patients with metastatic HER2positive breast cancer who received prior therapy with trastuzumab in combination with a taxane.
The results from the randomized phase 3 Th3RESA
trial comparing T-DM1 with a treatment of the physician’s choice were recently presented. The 602 patients
included in the trial had received a median of 4 prior
chemotherapy regimens in the metastatic setting, including trastuzumab and lapatinib. The median PFS was significantly higher with T-DM1 compared with a
treatment of the physician’s choice (6.2 months vs 3.3
months) (HR, 0.53 [95% CI, 0.42-0.66]; P < .0001).27
Based on the promising results observed in patients who
had received prior treatment in the metastatic setting, a
randomized phase 2 trial comparing T-DM1 with docetaxel plus trastuzumab was performed among 137 patients
in the first-line setting. The median PFS was significantly
higher with T-DM1 compared with docetaxel plus trastuzumab (14.2 months vs 9.2 months; HR, 0.59 [95% CI,
0.36-0.97]).28 MARIANNE, a phase 3 trial comparing
T-DM1, T-DM1 plus pertuzumab, and trastuzumab plus
a taxane in the first-line treatment of patients with metastatic HER2 positive breast cancer, is currently ongoing.
Intracellular delivery of the cytotoxic agent DM1 to
HER2-overexpressing cells minimized the toxicity noted
in other tissues. The most common adverse events associated with T-DM1 were thrombocytopenia and an elevation of liver enzymes. The majority of patients were able
to continue on treatment after dose modification for grade
3 or 4 events. Cardiac toxicity was comparable to treatment with trastuzumab.

Review Article

Figure 1. Schematic for human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-directed agents is shown. HER2 is a transmembrane
tyrosine kinase receptor. Homodimerization or heterodimerization leads to phosphorylation of the intracellular tyrosine kinase
domain, inducing cell proliferation and survival. Once phosphorylated, the HER2 receptor activates phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase
(PI3KK), which then leads to the activation of the enzyme Ak transforming factor (AKT), inducing cell survival. HER2 also activates the rat sarcoma (RAS) enzyme, which then activates mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), inducing cell proliferation.
Trastuzumab is a monoclonal antibody directed against HER2. Pertuzumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody that binds to
the dimerization domain of the HER2 receptor at a different epitope than trastuzumab. T-DM1 is an immunoconjugate that combines trastuzumab with the microtubule-targeting agent emtansine. Lapatinib and neratinib are oral tyrosine kinase inhibitors of
epidermal growth factor receptor (HER1) and HER2. BKM120 is an oral PI3K inhibitor. MK-2206 is an oral selective inhibitor of
AKT. Everolimus is an orally available mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitor.

Special Consideration for Patients With
Hormone Receptor-Positive, HER2-Positive
Disease

For patients whose tumors are hormone receptor (estrogen
receptor and progesterone receptor) -positive and HER2positive, non–chemotherapy-based approaches with dual
targeting of these pathways have also been studied. The addition of trastuzumab to first-line therapy with anastrozole has
demonstrated improved PFS (4.8 months vs 2.4 months;
P 5 .0016).7 Likewise, the addition of lapatinib to first-line
therapy with letrozole also improved clinical benefit and
PFS (8.2 months vs 3.0 months; P 5 .019).29 The addition
of HER2-directed therapy with either trastuzumab or lapatinib to endocrine therapy should be considered as a lowertoxicity first-line treatment for patients without symptomatic metastases or visceral crisis.30 Although the combination of lapatinib plus letrozole offers the advantage of being
an oral regimen, it is also associated with increased gastrointestinal toxicity due to the increased incidence of diarrhea.

Optimal Sequencing of HER2-Directed Agents

The incorporation of HER2-directed therapy has led to
significant improvements in response rates and OS for
patients with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer
(Fig. 1). The CLEOPATRA trial, in which patients
received dual antibody therapy with trastuzumab and pertuzumab in combination with docetaxel, demonstrated a
superior median PFS and OS, thereby establishing this as
the current standard of care for the first-line treatment of
patients with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer
(Table 1).18,19 Preliminary reports from ongoing studies
evaluating the dual antibody combination with paclitaxel
suggest this is a safe and effective combination as well.31
Several ongoing clinical trials will potentially impact
the optimal sequencing of therapy. The MARIANNE
trial compares T-DM1, T-DM1 plus pertuzumab, and
trastuzumab plus a taxane in the first-line setting. This
study was designed before the results of the CLEOPATRA study, and therefore the control arm of a taxane

plus trastuzumab does not contain pertuzumab. Although
it is exciting to consider a nontraditional chemotherapy
approach for the first-line treatment of patients with
HER2-positive breast cancer, many questions are likely to
result from this study. Comparisons of outcome between
patients treated on the T-DM1 and T-DM1 plus pertuzumab arms with the currently preferred first-line regimen
of docetaxel, trastuzumab, and pertuzumab will be challenging. Furthermore, if T-DM1 alone is determined to
be the best approach, the role of second-line pertuzumab
and trastuzumab with chemotherapy combinations will
also need to be evaluated. Currently, there are limited
data regarding the use of pertuzumab outside of the firstline setting and reimbursement may be challenging.17
Multiple treatment options are available at the time
of disease progression after first-line therapy (Table 2).8,9,24
Cancer

January 1, 2015

Before the FDA approval of T-DM1, patients typically
received subsequent lines of chemotherapy in combination
with trastuzumab or capecitabine and lapatinib in combination. Decisions regarding the sequencing of therapy typically took multiple variables into account such as prior
toxicities, ease of scheduling, and patient preference. The
EMILIA trial clearly demonstrated that T-DM1 was superior and less toxic than the combination of capecitabine
and lapatinib. The National Comprehensive Cancer Network currently recommends that T-DM1 should be the
preferred second-line regimen after disease progression
occurs during treatment with pertuzumab, trastuzumab,
and taxane-based therapy.
To the best of our knowledge, there are currently no
data regarding the role of continued trastuzumab after disease progression occurs while patients are receiving

treatment with a taxane with pertuzumab and
trastuzumab-based therapy in the first-line setting and TDM1 in the second-line setting. Extrapolation from prior
studies suggests that patients should continue to receive
HER2-directed therapy.8 However, more research is
needed to understand the mechanisms of resistance to
these newer HER2-targeted agents and to better define
the best approach in this setting. The optimal sequencing
for later lines is also unclear. Trastuzumab has been combined with several cytotoxic agents such as vinorelbine,
capecitabine, eribulin, liposomal doxorubicin, and gemcitabine in clinical trials, and has demonstrated clinical efficacy.32-35 Patients who prefer an oral regimen could opt
for therapy with capecitabine plus lapatinib. A nonchemotherapy option would include lapatinib with trastuzumab.11 In the absence of evidence establishing the optimal
sequence of therapy in the third-line or later setting,
patients and their physicians should weigh their options
and the potential side effects of therapy.
New HER2-Directed Agents Currently in
Development

Neratinib (Pfizer, New York, NY) and afatinib are orally
available, irreversible, tyrosine kinase inhibitors of EGFR
(HER1) and HER2 receptors. Early-phase clinical trials
have demonstrated their clinical activity as a single
agent.36-38 Neratinib has also been combined with trastuzumab, paclitaxel, and vinorelbine with promising results,
with response rates of 38% to 41% reported.39,40 Diarrhea has been the most frequently observed toxicity, and
has been managed with antidiarrheal medications and
dose reductions. A phase 2 trial comparing neratinib
monotherapy with lapatinib plus capecitabine was unable
to demonstrate the noninferiority of neratinib. The median PFS was 4.5 months on the neratinib arm and 6.8
months on the lapatinib plus capecitabine arm (HR, 1.19;
95% CI, 0.89-1.60).37 There are several ongoing clinical
trials with afatinib and neratinib, including a phase 3
study comparing the combination of neratinib and capecitabine with lapatinib and capecitabine.
Other novel HER2-directed therapies currently in
development include antibodies directed toward HER3 as
single agents and in combination with HER2-directed
therapy, radioimmunotherapy with trastuzumab, and vaccines targeting the HER2 protein.
The majority of the focus of drug development for
patients with HER2-positive breast cancer has now shifted
to combinations targeting the mechanisms of resistance.
Resistance to trastuzumab-based therapy affects most
patients with metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer. Acti22

vation of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Ak
transforming factor (AKT)/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway is common in patients with HER2positive breast cancer. The Cancer Genome Atlas Network
reported that 39% of patients with HER2-positive breast
cancer harbor a PIK3CA mutation.41 Furthermore, activation of this pathway has been associated with resistance to
HER2-based therapies42 and agents targeting this pathway
can reverse this resistance in preclinical models.43
Clinical data are emerging to support these laboratory
findings. In the CLEOPATRA trial, PIK3CA mutations
were associated with a poorer prognosis in both treatment
arms.18 The addition of everolimus, an orally available
mTOR inhibitor, to HER2-directed therapy demonstrated
encouraging activity in both phase 1 and 2 clinical trials.44,45 A randomized phase 3 clinical trial (BOLERO-3)
evaluating the addition of everolimus to trastuzumab plus
vinorelbine in heavily pretreated patients with HER2positive metastatic breast cancer demonstrated significant
improvements in PFS (7.0 months vs 5.8 months;
P < .01), although this was somewhat modest in terms of
clinical benefit. Longer follow-up is needed to evaluate OS
in this trial.46 BOLERO-1 is an ongoing trial evaluating
the addition of everolimus to first-line therapy with trastuzumab and paclitaxel. Whether mTOR inhibition will be
more important in overcoming acquired resistance to trastuzumab or will play a role in the first-line setting will be
important to define from these studies.
AKT and PI3K inhibitors also are being studied in
combination with trastuzumab and lapatinib. A phase 1
study of MK-2206, an oral selective inhibitor of AKT, in
combination with trastuzumab demonstrated that the combination was safe and clinical activity was observed in heavily
pretreated patients.47 An ongoing phase 1 study of MK-2206
in combination with lapatinib was also recently completed
(NCT01245205). BKM120 (buparlisib) is an oral PI3K inhibitor that has been studied in a phase Ib study in combination with trastuzumab. The combination was tolerable at the
single-agent maximum tolerated dose of buparlisib and clinical activity was observed in patients with trastuzumabresistant disease.48 Multiple other PI3K inhibitors or dual
PI3K/mTOR inhibitors also are being studied in combination with trastuzumab, lapatinib, and T-DM1.499
Conclusions and Future Directions

The development of HER2-directed agents, including trastuzumab, pertuzumab, lapatinib, and T-DM1, has significantly improved long-term outcomes for patients with
HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer. Currently, trastuzumab, pertuzumab, and taxane-based therapy are

setting and beyond, several options are recommended,
including lapatinib in combination with capecitabine or
trastuzumab or other trastuzumab-based combinations with
chemotherapy (Figure 2). Novel HER2-directed agents are
in various stages of clinical development. Results from
ongoing clinical trials of currently available agents and novel
agents could impact the optimal sequencing of HER2directed therapies in the metastatic setting (Table 3). The
evolving use of HER2-directed therapies in the setting of
early-stage disease, such as the recent FDA approval of pertuzumab for neoadjuvant therapy, could also impact the
choice of first-line therapy in the metastatic setting.
