Abstract
Rho-associated kinase (ROCK) signaling plays a fundamental
role in regulating cell morphology, adhesion, and motility.
Aberrant expression of ROCK is related to tumor metastases
and poor clinical outcome. Here, we show that ROCK expression is increased in metastatic human mammary tumors and
breast cancer cell lines compared with nonmetastatic tumors
and cell lines. Overexpression of ROCK confers a metastatic
phenotype on the nonmetastatic MCF-7 cell line. Inhibition
of ROCK activity, by either a specific ROCK inhibitor
(Y27632) or ROCK-targeted small interfering RNAs, reduces
cell migration and proliferation in vitro and metastasis to
bone in vivo using a novel “human breast cancer metastasis
to human bone” mouse model. Expression of the c-Myc–
regulated miR-17-92 cluster is shown to be elevated in metastatic breast cancer cells compared with nonmetastatic cells
and diminished by Y27632 treatment. Furthermore, blockade
of miR-17 is shown to decrease breast cancer cell invasion/
migration in vitro and metastasis in vivo. Together, these
findings suggest that augmented ROCK signaling contributes
to breast cancer metastasis. The effects of ROCK on tumor cell
invasion/motility and growth may derive from regulating
cytoskeletal actin-myosin contraction and modulating the
c-Myc pathway, including c-Myc–dependent microRNAs.
Inhibition of ROCK or the pathway it stimulates, therefore,
may represent a novel approach for treatment of breast
cancer metastases. [Cancer Res 2009;69(22):8742–51]

Introduction
Breast cancer is by far the most common cancer among women
and the fifth most common cause of cancer death worldwide.
Although the primary tumor often causes significant morbidity,
metastasis to distant organs accounts for >90% of breast cancer–
related mortality. The underlying mechanisms responsible for
breast cancer metastasis have not yet been elucidated. Additionally, there is little in the way of metastasis-specific therapy. Members
of Rho small GTPases play a role in regulating cell morphology,
growth, apoptosis, and motility. The Rho-associated kinases
(ROCK), of which there are two isoforms, ROCK1 and ROCK2 (here
called ROCK), are principal mediators of Rho small GTPases.
ROCK is implicated in the regulation of breast cancer metastasis.
A clinical study showed that increased expression of ROCK corresponds to late-stage tumors and metastases and is negatively

correlated with overall survival in breast cancer patients (1). Overexpression of ROCK enhances invasion/migration in breast and
other tumor cells in vitro (2, 3). Correspondingly, both the expression of a dominant-negative ROCK and the exposure of cells to a
ROCK inhibitor suppress cancer cell invasion/migration in vitro
and in vivo (4, 5).
MicroRNAs (miRNA) are small, noncoding RNAs that negatively
regulate gene expression. miRNAs can regulate tumor development, progression, and metastasis by functioning as either oncogenes or tumor suppressors. The c-Myc–regulated miR-17-92
cluster functions as a potential human oncogene (6). It is overexpressed in different types of tumors, including breast, prostate, and
lung cancers, and in hematologic malignancies (7–9). Forced overexpression of miR-17-92 in a mouse model of B-cell lymphoma promoted disease onset and progression (10).
In the current study, we investigate ROCK-induced molecular
events that may be responsible for breast cancer metastases using
in vitro assays and the murine “human breast cancer metastasis to
human bone” model in which breast cancer cells metastasize from
the orthotopic site (11). ROCK inhibition by either a specific ROCK
inhibitor or ROCK-specific small interfering RNAs (siRNA) can suppress breast cancer cell growth and migration in vitro and decrease
metastasis to bone in vivo. Inhibition of ROCK signaling therefore
may prove to be a promising strategy for prevention of breast cancer metastasis.

Materials and Methods
Human breast cancer specimens, cell lines, and cell culture. Human
mammary tumor cDNAs were purchased from Origene. Human breast cancer cells were cultured as described previously (11, 12).
Animal experiments. All animal experimental procedures were approved by the Tufts University Department of Laboratory Animal Management and Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Experimental
setup was similar to the methods described previously (11) and depicted
in Fig. 1. Beginning on the second day after breast cancer cell injection, one
group of mice received i.p. injection of Y27632 (Sigma; 8 mg/kg in 100 μL
PBS) every other day for 10 weeks. Control mice received PBS.
Cell proliferation, ROCK activity, wound-healing, and Transwell
migration assays. Breast cancer cells were serum-starved for 24 h and then
cultured in medium with 1% fetal bovine serum with or without Y27632 at
10 μmol/L followed by MTT-based proliferation (Roche) and ROCK activity
(Cyclex) assays according to the manufacturer's protocols and a woundhealing assay as described previously (13). Transwell migration was assessed
according to the manufacturer's instructions (Corning). Cells on the filters
were visualized by 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (Molecular Probes).
FITC-conjugated phalloidin staining. Breast cancer cells were cultured in medium containing 1% fetal bovine serum with or without 10
μmol/L Y27632 for 24 h. Then, cells were fixed by formaldehyde and
washed with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS. Primary tumor tissues were fixed
in formalin and then processed for paraffin-embedding and sectioning.
FITC-conjugated phalloidin (Molecular Probes) was used to label F-actin.
Cell nuclei were counterstained with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole.

miRNA microarray analysis. miRNA isolation kits (Ambion) were used
to isolate total RNA with enriched miRNAs from cells. miRNA microarray
analyses were done by LC Sciences as described previously (14). Those with
fold change > 2 or <-2 and P values < 0.05 (t test) were considered as differentially expressed miRNAs.
siRNA and miRNA molecule transfection. Prevalidated siRNA molecules were synthesized by Qiagen. Two sets of siRNAs were used to target
different regions of the mRNAs for ROCK1/ROCK2 or c-Myc. Anti–miR-17
molecules were obtained from Ambion. The small RNA transfection was
done according to the manufacturer's protocols.
In vivo administration of anti–miR-17 molecules. Tumor tissues
(0.02 g) derived from MDA-MB-231 cells were implanted underneath
mouse mammary fat pads in our model. Two weeks later, when primary tumors reached ∼75 mm3, 50 μL anti–miR-17 or scrambled control
RNA molecules diluted in PBS (2 mg/mL) were injected into tumors.
The anti–miR-17 and scrambled control RNAs were synthesized as
described previously (15). Mice (n = 5) received injections every other
day for 2 weeks.
Western blot, flow cytometry, and quantitative reverse transcriptionPCR analyses. These analyses were done as described previously (16–19).
Antibodies and primers used in the study are listed in Supplementary
Table S1 and S2.
Statistical analysis. Two-tailed Student's t test was used to analyze experimental data; P < 0.05 determined statistical significance. All results are

Results
ROCK expression in breast cancer. To investigate the potential role of ROCK signaling in regulation of breast cancer metastasis, we assessed the expression of ROCK in human breast cancer
specimens and cell lines. The expression of ROCK1 and ROCK2,
particularly ROCK1 (>2-fold, P = 0.057), is increased in metastatic
human mammary tumors (from patients with nodal metastasis)
compared with nonmetastatic tumors (node-negative; Fig. 1A;
Supplementary Fig. S1A). Further, the expression of ROCK1 and
ROCK2 is increased in late-stage tumors compared with early-stage
tumors (Supplementary Fig. S1A). Additionally, both ROCK1 and
ROCK2 (particularly ROCK1) are markedly elevated in the tumorigenic and metastatic cell lines, MDA-MB-231, 2287 (12), 1833 (12),
SUM1315, and BP2,5 compared with the tumorigenic but nonmetastatic cell lines, MCF-7 and SUM149 (Fig. 1B; Supplementary Fig.
S1B). As a result, ROCK kinase activity is significantly increased
in metastatic cells compared with nonmetastatic cells (Fig. 2A;
Supplementary Fig. S1C). These observations suggest that overexpression of ROCK may contribute to the metastatic features of
breast cancer cells.

ROCK has been shown to phosphorylate the regulatory myosin
light chain (MLC), which enhances its binding to F-actin (20).
Consistent with the increased ROCK1 and ROCK2 and elevated
ROCK activity (Fig. 1; Supplementary Fig. S1), the amount of phosphorylated MLC (p-MLC) is greatly increased in MDA-MB-231 and
SUM1315 cells compared with MCF-7 cells in vitro (Figs. 1B and
2D). MYH9, nonmuscle myosin heavy chain-IIA, is an essential
component of the cell motor system in eukaryotes and involved
in the regulation of cell morphology, motility, and division (21).
For the first time, we observed that the expression of MYH9 is
significantly increased in MDA-MB-231 and SUM1315 compared
with MCF-7 (Fig. 1B). The combined effect of increased p-MLC
and MYH9 may lead to enhanced stabilization of the F-actin
meshwork and augmented actin-myosin–mediated contraction in
MDA-MB-231 and SUM1315 cells and thereby contribute to the
metastatic phenotypes of these cells.
Using a mouse model of “human breast cancer metastasis to human bone” (Fig. 1C; ref. 11), we observed increased ROCK1 and
ROCK2 and MYH9 expression in metastatic MDA-MB-231 and
SUM1315 cells in human bone cores compared with cells from

primary tumors at the orthotopic site (mammary fat pads) as
shown by quantitative reverse transcription-PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis (P < 0.05; Fig. 1D). The overexpression of ROCK1 and ROCK2
and MYH9 in bone-residing metastatic cells indicates their potential role in promoting breast cancer bone metastasis. Collectively,
increased levels of ROCK appear to confer enhanced metastatic
capability on breast cancer cells.
Effects of the ROCK inhibitor on cell motility/migration and
proliferation. To test whether inhibition of ROCK can reduce
breast cancer cell motility and migration, we used the ROCK inhibitor, Y27632 (22), to carry out several in vitro experiments. Consistent with previous reports (23, 24), ROCK activity was reduced
∼50% in MCF-7, MDA-MB-231, and SUM1315 cells on treatment
with Y27632 (Fig. 2A), suggesting that Y27632 is effective in repressing ROCK activity. Y27632 significantly reduces cell migration
from cytodex beads by 30% to 40% in MDA-MB-231 and
SUM1315 cells (P < 0.05; Supplementary Fig. S2A). Moreover, a
wound-healing assay showed that Y27632 inhibits cell motility in
MDA-MB-231 (Fig. 2B) and SUM1315 (data not shown) cells.
Consistent with previous reports (22, 25), we observed disassembly

Figure 3. Regulation of c-Myc by ROCK. A, Western blot analyses of c-Myc and HSPC111 in breast cancer cells. B, relative expression of c-Myc in metastatic
breast cancer cells harvested from human bone cores compared with cells from primary tumors by qRT-PCR (n = 3-4). C, Western blot analyses of c-Myc and p-c-Myc in

for 24 and 48 h in the bottom blots. D, c-Myc level on ROCK siRNAs in SUM1315 cells. The bar graph shows the ROCK activity on ROCK1 and ROCK2 silencing
for 48 h (n = 4). The levels of ROCK1/ROCK2, p-MLC, c-Myc, and p-c-Myc were examined by Western blot analyses with ROCK1 and ROCK2 siRNAs.
*, P < 0.05, compared with corresponding cell types in primary tumors in B and controls in D.

of actin fibers and reduction of stress fiber formation, with the
density of actin meshwork reduced in these cells on Y27632
treatment (Fig. 2C; Supplementary Fig. S2B). Additionally, Y27632
repressed proliferation in all three cell lines by ∼25% (P < 0.05;
Fig. 2D; Supplementary Fig. S2C), corresponding to previous
reports describing its effects in other cell types (26).
As observed by others (25), p-MLC is greatly decreased on
Y27632 treatment in breast cancer cells (Fig. 2D), indicating that
the reduction of ROCK activity by Y27632 leads to attenuation of
its downstream targets. For the first time, we observed that
the level of MYH9 is reduced by Y27632 in breast cancer cells
(Fig. 2D), although the mechanism remains unknown. Whether
MYH9 is a direct or an indirect downstream target of ROCK
signaling will be examined in future studies. Decreased p-MLC
and MYH9 likely alter cell morphology and impair motility in
breast cancer cells after Y27632 treatment.
ROCK-c-Myc pathway in breast cancer cells. To gain insight
into the mechanism whereby ROCK inhibition decreases cell motility and proliferation, we considered the potential downstream
targets of ROCK. Ingenuity Pathway Analysis was used to identify
the potential network regulated by ROCK signaling; c-Myc is
predicted to be a downstream target of ROCK (Supplementary
Fig. S3A). Previous studies also suggest that ROCK is implicated

www.aacrjournals.org

in the regulation of c-Myc (25, 27, 28). c-Myc plays a pivotal role
in modulating cell division and transformation (29, 30), and clinical
studies have shown a strong association between overexpression of
c-Myc and tumor metastasis (31–33). In our study, the c-Myc level
was significantly increased in MDA-MB-231 and SUM1315 cells
compared with MCF-7 cells in vitro (Fig. 3A; Supplementary Fig.
S3B and C). In addition, c-Myc was increased in both metastatic
SUM1315 and MDA-MB-231 cells harvested from human bone
grafts compared with the same cell types from primary tumors
in our mouse model (P < 0.05; Fig. 3B). Overexpression of c-Myc
in MDA-MB-231 and SUM1315 cells and human bone core–residing
metastatic breast cancer cells is consistent with their prometastatic phenotype (12, 34) and indicative of the role of c-Myc in
facilitating breast cancer cell metastasis from the primary site to
bone. A recent study showed that Y27632 induces a significant
reduction of c-Myc in Rho Q63L-transformed fibroblasts (25).
Similar to this observation, we observed reduced c-Myc in
MDA-MB-231 and SUM1315 cells with Y27632 treatment in vitro
(Fig. 3C). The level of p-c-Myc, the activated form of c-Myc, was
determined by Western blot analysis using an antibody that recognizes c-Myc protein singly or doubly phosphorylated at
Thr 58 and Ser 62 or both. p-c-Myc is greatly decreased in
SUM1315 cells 24 and 48 h after Y27632 treatment (Fig. 3C),

consistent with previous reports (27, 28). To confirm the hypothesis that ROCK activity contributes to c-Myc phosphorylation and
its protein level, we knocked down the expression of both ROCK1
and ROCK2 using prevalidated siRNAs. The levels of ROCK1 and
ROCK2 are reduced by ∼98% and 60% by siRNAs, respectively, and
the ROCK activity and the amount of p-MLC are significantly reduced (Fig. 3D). On reduction of ROCK activity, the levels of c-Myc
and p-c-Myc are significantly decreased (Fig. 3D).
A direct c-Myc target, HSPC111, was reported to be overexpressed in breast cancer and is associated with poor prognosis
(35). Although its role in breast cancer development and metastasis
has not been defined, it was shown to influence cell proliferation
(35). The HSPC111 level is dramatically increased in MDA-MB231 and SUM1315 compared with MCF-7 (Fig. 3A) and may have
a regulatory role in breast cancer metastasis.

c-Myc–regulated miR-17-92 cluster in breast cancer cells.
To further delineate the ROCK/c-Myc pathway, we investigated
the role of miR-17-92 (Fig. 4A) in breast cancer growth and motility. A microarray analysis of miRNAs was done using SUM1315,
MDA-MB-231, and MCF-7 cells as described in Materials and
Methods and Supplementary Fig. S4. The transcription of miR17-92 is directly regulated by c-Myc. As c-Myc expression is increased in MDA-MB-231 and SUM1315 cells compared with
MCF-7 cells and in metastatic breast cancer cells in human bone
cores compared with cells from primary tumors, we would expect
elevated expression of miRNAs in this cluster in MDA-MB-231 and
SUM1315 cells and in metastatic breast cancer cells in human bone
cores. Indeed, microarray analysis showed a 2- to 6-fold increase of
expression of miR-17, miR-19a, miR-20a, miR-19b, and miR-92-1 in
both MDA-MB-231 and SUM1315 cells compared with MCF-7 cells

lines was validated by endpoint and qRT-PCR (Fig. 4B; Supplementary Fig. S5). The miR-17-92 expression was also elevated in human
bone core–residing metastatic breast cancer cells compared with

Of miRNAs in the miR-17-92 cluster, miR-17 in particular
has been shown to modulate cell proliferation and apoptosis
(15, 36, 37), and anti–miR-17 molecules abolish the growth of

that anti–miR-17 molecules diminish cell proliferation by 35%
and 24% in MDA-MB-231 and SUM1315 cells, respectively (P <
0.05; Supplementary Fig. S6A). Moreover, anti–miR-17 molecules
reduced cell motility by 40% to 50% in a Transwell migration
assay (P < 0.005; Fig. 4D; Supplementary Fig. S6B). We found
no significant effect on apoptosis with addition of anti–miR-17
molecules based on an analysis of flow cytometry using FITCAnnexin V and propidium iodide stains (data not shown).
Together, the fact that miR-17-92 expression is elevated in
metastatic breast cancer cells and the observation that miR-17
is involved in the regulation of cell proliferation and motility

suggest that this cluster may contribute to the tumorigenic
and metastatic features of breast cancer cells.
Overexpression or inhibition of ROCK signaling in breast
cancer in vivo. To determine the role of ROCK in vivo, we investigated the effect of enhancement and inhibition of ROCK activity
on metastases using a mouse model of breast cancer metastasis to
bone (11). First, we overexpressed the ROCK kinase in nonmetastatic MCF-7 cells (described in Supplementary Data). Elevation
of ROCK activity conferred a metastatic phenotype on MCF-7
cells: ROCK-overexpressing MCF-7 cells metastasized to mouse
hind limbs (67%), livers (67%), and human bone cores (33%;

Inhibition of ROCK Signaling Suppresses Breast Cancer Metastasis to Bone

Fig. 5A; Supplementary Fig. S7). This finding is in striking contrast
to vector-control MCF-7 cells, which developed no metastases (Fig. 5A;
Supplementary Fig. S7), and consistent with the well-documented
observation that MCF-7 cells exhibit no metastatic propensity
(38). Then, we examined the effects of a ROCK inhibitor (Y27632)
and ROCK1 knockdown by short hairpin RNAs (described in Supplementary Fig. S8) on breast cancer metastasis to human bone cores
and the mouse skeleton. All mice remained healthy for the duration
of the experiment; no clinical or pathologic signs of toxicity from
Y27632 were observed, similar to previous reports (22, 39). All mice
developed tumors at the injected mammary fat pad sites, consistent
with our previous results (11). As shown in Supplementary Fig. S9A,
the average weight of primary tumors in Y27632-treated mice was
reduced, but not significantly (P > 0.05), compared with vehicletreated mice, consistent with a mild effect of Y27632 on cell proliferation in vitro (Fig. 2D; Supplementary Fig. S3C). Metastases to
human bone cores were fewer in Y27632-treated mice (5 of 14,
36%) than control mice (8 of 12, 67%; Fig. 5B) as shown by luminescent imaging using the Biophotonic Imager machine (40). All (6 of 6)
control mice developed bilateral hind limb metastases (for a total of
12 involved hind limbs). In the Y27632-treated mice, 6 of 7 had metastases (3 had bilateral and 3 had unilateral hind limb metastases
for a total of 9 involved hind limbs); 1 had no metastases in either
hind limb. Thus, the overall frequency of metastasis to mouse hind
limbs in Y27632-treated mice was reduced by 36% (12 of 12 versus 9
of 14) compared with controls (Fig. 5C). Moreover, the mass of metastatic tumors in the mouse skeleton (reflected by photon flux,
photons/s) was also diminished by 77% in Y27632-treated mice compared with controls (P < 0.05; Fig. 5C). ROCK1 short hairpin RNAs
also decreases the frequency of breast cancer metastases to human
bone cores and the mouse skeleton (Fig. 5; Supplementary Data).
To ascertain the efficiency of i.p. injection of Y27632 in diminishing ROCK activity in the primary tumors, we performed a ROCK
kinase assay using tissue lysates from primary tumors. The ROCK
activity in tumors from Y27632-treated mice was decreased by 42%
(P < 0.05) compared with the controls (Fig. 5D), corresponding to
the effect observed in vitro (Fig. 2A). The phosphorylated level of
the direct substrate of ROCK, MLC, was significantly diminished in
tumors from Y27632-treated mice (P < 0.001; Fig. 5D) in parallel to
the in vitro observation (Fig. 2D). Additionally, we observed diminished density and looser structure of the actin meshwork in primary tumors from Y27632-treated mice by FITC-conjugated
phalloidin staining (Supplementary Fig. S9B), which was similar
to our in vitro observations (Fig. 2C). The ROCK activity in tumors
of ROCK1-short hairpin RNA mice was reduced by 24%, and p-MLC
was also decreased (P < 0.05; Fig. 5D).
Anti–miR-17 molecules diminish breast cancer metastasis
in vivo. To examine the effect of miR-17 silencing on metastasis
in vivo, we administrated anti–miR-17 molecules intratumorally into primary tumors generated from the tumor implants (derived
from MDA-MB-231 cells). Two weeks after anti–miR-17 molecule
injection, the growth of primary tumors was not affected
(Fig. 6A). The frequency of metastasis to human bone cores was
reduced by 50% compared with a scrambled control (Fig. 6B).
Although breast cancer cells metastasized to all hind limbs in both
the control and anti–miR-17-treated groups, the mass of metastatic tumors in anti–miR-17-treated mice was greatly reduced
compared with controls (Fig. 6B). Additionally, the frequency of
metastasis to lungs was also reduced by 50% (Fig. 6B). miR-17
was recently shown to target the type II transforming growth
factor-β receptor (TβR2; ref. 41). Consistent with this finding, we

observed a great increase of TβR2 in vitro and in vivo on treatment
with anti–miR-17 molecules (Fig. 6C). TβR2 was recently reported
to be a metastasis suppressor: deletion of TβR2 in breast cancer
cells recruits Gr-1 +CD11b+ cells that facilitate metastasis (42).
Corresponding to this report, in the current study, we observed a
significant decrease of Gr-1+CD11b+ cells in primary tumors treated with anti–miR-17 molecules (Fig. 6D), suggesting an important
role of miR-17-mediated TβR2 signaling in regulating metastasis.

Discussion
The ability of cancer cells to detach and become motile requires
enhanced actin meshwork-dependent adhesion and actin-myosin
contraction. ROCK plays a central role in these processes. Phosphorylation of MLC by ROCK is the key mechanism for actinmyosin–based contraction, increasing the assembly of filamentous
myosin heavy chains and promoting the binding of myosin and
F-actin (43, 44). The net effect of ROCK activation is to enhance
actin cytoskeleton and to increase actin-myosin–dependent force
generation. Increased ROCK is correlated with poor clinical outcomes and late-stage tumors (1). The expression of ROCK1 in primary breast cancer tumors that give rise to metastases is much
greater than in tumors that do not give rise to metastases (1).
In the current study, we found that expression of both ROCK1
and ROCK2 (particularly ROCK1) is greatly increased in metastatic
human mammary tumors compared with nonmetastatic tumors
and in metastatic breast cancer cells compared with nonmetastatic cells in vitro. ROCK expression is significantly increased in
the metastatic breast cancer cells harvested from human bone
grafts compared with cells at the orthotopic sites in our mouse
model. In addition, we showed that overexpression of ROCK converts classically nonmetastatic MCF-7 cells into cells with metastatic capability. Taken together, our data confirm the crucial
role of ROCK in promoting breast cancer metastasis.
Many studies have shown that c-Myc is amplified and/or
overexpressed in breast cancer (34, 45), particularly in late-stage/
high-grade tumors and metastatic tumors (31–33). Its aberrant
expression appears to be a clinical prognostic marker for recurrence and adverse outcomes in breast cancer patients (46, 47).
In the current study, the significant increase of c-Myc expression
in metastatic breast cancer cells in vitro and in vivo suggests a role
of c-Myc in breast cancer metastasis. As shown previously, ROCK
increases the stabilization of c-Myc protein via phosphorylation in
RhoA-transformed kidney epithelial cells (28). Thus, the reduction
of c-Myc via ROCK inhibition by either Y27632 or ROCK siRNAs
could be due to the degradation of this protein because of
decreased phosphorylation. Increased baseline c-Myc in these metastatic cells may be due to high endogenous levels of ROCK activity. Further, a reduction of c-Myc level may explain the resultant
attenuated cell proliferation by ROCK inhibition in vitro. Together,
our observations support a link between ROCK and c-Myc. As c-Myc
is downstream of many signaling pathways and its regulation is
complex, involving transcriptional regulation and post-translational
modifications (48), ROCK may be one of its regulators. Meanwhile,
the possibility of an autocrine loop between ROCK and c-Myc is
excluded, as ROCK levels are not significantly changed after c-Myc
silencing (Supplementary Fig. S3D). However, thus far, a direct interaction between ROCK and c-Myc has not been shown.
Coupled to increased c-Myc, miR-17-92 expression is increased
in metastatic breast cancer cells in vitro and in vivo. Moreover,
miR-17-92 expression is significantly attenuated by treatment with

Y27632. Because this cluster is transcriptionally regulated by c-Myc
(6), which is targeted by ROCK (25), the attenuation of miR-17-92
expression by Y27632 treatment suggests a direct link between
ROCK signaling and miRNA regulation. Among the miRNAs in this
cluster, miR-17 has been shown to modulate cell proliferation by
targeting CDKN1A/p21 (15, 36), an inhibitor of cell cycle progression (49). We observed that anti–miR-17 molecules reduce cell
proliferation and lead to the upregulation of p21 mRNA in MDAMB-231 and SUM1315 cells (data not shown), consistent with
effects observed in B-cell lymphoma (36) and neuroblastoma cells
(15). Importantly, we show for the first time that anti–miR-17 molecules reduce breast cancer cell migration in vitro and metastasis
in vivo. The in vivo administration of anti–miR-17 molecules for
2 weeks greatly represses metastases without significant effect
on primary tumor growth.
One potential mechanism responsible for miR-17–promoted
metastasis is regulation of TβR2, a target of miR-17 (41). Here,
we show that anti–miR-17 molecules significantly upregulate
TβR2 and diminish the Gr-1+CD11b+ cell population in primary
tumors. The recruitment of Gr-1+CD11b+ cells in breast cancer
tumors was recently shown to facilitate metastasis via the SDF1/CXCR4 and CXCL5/CXCR2 axes (42). Taken together, these findings indicate that this cluster contributes to the regulation of
breast cancer tumor growth and metastasis, and its expression is
dependent on ROCK signaling.
In line with the effects of Y27632 on cell motility and migration
in vitro, Y27632 significantly reduces metastases to human bone
cores (by 46%) and mouse skeleton (by 36%) as well as the mass
of metastases in the mouse skeleton (by 77%). Y27632 competes
with ATP for binding to the catalytic domain of ROCK (50), leading

to inhibition of the kinase. The dose of Y27632 used in our experiment (8 mg/kg) is ∼3 times lower than that used in a similar study
(assuming the average body weight of each mouse is 40 g; ref. 5);
however, the reduction of ROCK activity is equivalent. This observation suggests that inhibition of ROCK activity by Y27632 reaches
a limit possibly due to saturation of the binding of Y27632 to the
ROCK catalytic site. Although suppression of metastasis by Y27632
is shown in our investigations, little effect on primary tumor mass
was observed, implying that Y27632 and ROCK inhibition, in general, may have a metastasis-specific effect.
Collectively, ROCK may enhance the metastatic propensity of
breast cancer cells by stabilizing the actin cytoskeleton, enhancing actin-myosin contraction, and promoting the c-Myc pathway,
including transcription of c-Myc–regulated miRNAs (Supplementary Fig. S10). Inhibition of ROCK-mediated signaling appears to
be a promising and potentially specific approach to suppress
breast cancer metastases.
