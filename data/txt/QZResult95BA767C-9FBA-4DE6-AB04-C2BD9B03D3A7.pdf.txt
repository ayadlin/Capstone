Abstract
Author Manuscript

The discovery of microtube structures that link tumour cells in some invasive brain tumours
reveals how these cancers spread, and how they resist treatment.
Hardly any diagnosis is as distressing as that of a primary brain tumour. These tumours,
often known as gliomas, are a varied group that originate from immature stem cells or from
glial cells, which support and protect neuronal networks throughout the brain1. Gliomas
proliferate uncontrollably, destroying surrounding brain tissue and causing profound
neurological damage. They are responsible for around 14,000 deaths each year in the United
States alone2, and are almost always deadly, owing to their resistance to radiation therapy
and ability to infiltrate healthy brain tissue. In a paper online in Nature, Osswald et al.3 shed
light on what confers these destructive abilities.

Gliomas have long frustrated neurosurgeons4, because cancerous cells invade the
surrounding brain before diagnosis is possible, making surgical removal of these tumours
inefficient. The tumours move into the brain through extracellular spaces5, often following
the outside of blood vessels or nerve tracts — in contrast to most other cancers, which
disseminate through the blood or lymphatic systems. The invading cells must be killed if
treatment is to be successful, and so patients typically undergo aggressive radiation therapy
in combination with chemotherapy.

Many gliomas, including the most malignant varieties, resist both radiation and
chemotherapy. But a small subgroup called oligodendrogliomas, which harbour deletions in
two chromosomal regions dubbed 1p and 19q, respond well to radiation treatment and carry
a more favourable prognosis6. Osswald and colleagues set out to determine what accounts
for this difference in radiation sensitivity.
The authors labelled patient-derived glioma cells taken from a variety of tumours before
transplanting them into the brains of mice. Using in vivo microscopy, they visualized tumour
growth and invasion for up to one year through a window implanted in the animals’ heads.
Invading glioma cells without the 1p and 19q co-deletion extended long, thin, contractile
processes into the surrounding brain tissue. The researchers called these structures tumour
microtubes.
The microtubes were rich in the proteins actin and myosin, which are known7 to propel
neuronal growth cones (structures at the tips of developing neurons that project out to seek

other cells with which to connect). Some microtubes explored, and eventually invaded, the
healthy brain. By contrast, others contacted neighbouring tumour cells, forming cytoplasmic
bridges between adjacent cells (Fig. 1). This effectively turned the cells into a single
organismal unit (a syncytium). The connections between microtubes from each tumour cell
were formed by cytoplasm-filled pores called gap junctions, composed of hexameric Cx43
proteins.

What advantage might the tumour gain from growing as a single organismal unit? Osswald
et al. found that cells of the syncytium were highly resistant to radiation therapy. In
unconnected cells, radiation caused an increase in intracellular calcium-ion levels that
triggered cell death. But in cells of the syncytium, Ca2+ levels remained more stable,
presumably because the extra Ca2+ was distributed among all cells. Furthermore, when the
nucleus of a connected cell was ablated by laser, the neighbouring cell extended a microtube
into the affected tissue to deliver a newly synthesized cell nucleus, thus replacing the dead
neighbour with a newly nucleated cell — a remarkable feat. The connected cells can thus be
thought of as forming a neighbourhood watch group, protecting one another by sharing toxic
exposure and even going as far as replacing dead neighbours with part of themselves.
These results indicate that those gliomas that are sensitive to radiation should not be part of a
protective neighbourhood. Indeed, when Osswald et al. analysed human biopsies from
oligodendrogliomas, fewer than 1% contained microtubes and Cx43 expression was almost
absent. The authors also found that microtubes and Cx43 were lacking when they
transplanted oligodendroglioma-derived cells harbouring the 1p and 19q co-deletion into
mice.

Because microtubes are at the heart of the glioma network, the authors next searched for
genes that regulate microtube formation. Through Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (a computeraided method for detecting genes linked to biological traits), they identified Gap-43 as a
candidate. The GAP-43 protein aids neuronal migration and the formation of neural growth
cones during development8. It was prominently expressed on the invading tips of tumour
microtubes, and was conspicuously absent in 1p and 19q co-deleted tumours. Moreover,
forced expression of GAP-43 in oligodendroglioma-derived transplants produced highly
invasive tumours that acted in protective, microtube-connected networks and resisted
radiation. Thus, GAP-43 seems to mediate tumour-microtube formation.

This carefully executed study advances our understanding of brain-tumour growth. For
instance, it is now clear that the gap junctions formed by Cx43 are central to the success of
glioma neighbourhoods. This protein has been thought to act as a tumour suppressor,
preventing cell division in cancers, including gliomas9. By contrast, Osswald and
colleagues’ findings imply that tumour growth is enhanced by the presence of Cx43. This
difference can be reconciled when one considers the organism-like growth of the syncytium
— in this scenario, the connected cells protect and support one other, allowing the tumour
mass to grow even when exposed to radiation.
Although the authors hypothesize that the sharing of Ca2+ confers resistance to radiation,
many other mechanisms could be at work. Gap junctions allow the passage of many

macromolecules between cells, including ATP, amino acids and even microRNAs. One
molecule deserving of consideration is the antioxidant glutathione, which readily permeates
gap junctions to directly protect cells from radiation damage7.
From a therapeutic perspective, Cx43 is a challenging pharmacological target. The protein is
expressed throughout the body, and is required both for glial transport of cellular
metabolites, signals and waste products, and to ensure that heart cells contract in synchrony.
Drugs that block Cx43 have been used to heal chronic skin ulcers in humans10 and to
enhance the effectiveness of the chemotherapeutic drug temozolamide in treating gliomas in
mice11. However, Osswald and colleagues’ discovery that GAP-43 is responsible for
establishing glioma networks might point to a more effective target for combating these
destructive cancers.

Osswald et al.3 report that, in some types of brain tumour, structures called microtubes
connect tumour cells, allowing them to act as a single, organism-like unit. Tumour
microtubes facilitate invasion into healthy brain tissue. They permit the spread of toxic
molecules such as calcium ions (Ca2+) that build up during radiation therapy, allowing the
whole unit to share the burden of toxicity. Furthermore, if tumour tissue is surgically
removed, newly synthesized nuclei donated by tumour cells can travel down the microtube
to the cell-free site to form new tumour cells.
