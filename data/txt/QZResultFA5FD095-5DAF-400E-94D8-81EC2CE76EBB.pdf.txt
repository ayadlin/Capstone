through Cep55

Abstract
Failure of cytokinesis results in tetraploidy and can increase
the genomic instability frequently observed in cancer. The
peptidyl-prolyl isomerase Pin1, which is deregulated in many
tumors, regulates several processes, including cell cycle
progression. Here, we show a novel role for Pin1 in
cytokinesis. Pin1 knockout mouse embryonic fibroblasts show
a cytokinesis delay, and depletion of Pin1 from HeLa cells also
causes a cytokinesis defect. Furthermore, we provide evidence
that Pin1 localizes to the midbody ring and regulates the final
stages of cytokinesis by binding to centrosome protein 55 kDa
(Cep55), an essential component of this ring. This interaction
induces Polo-like kinase 1–mediated phosphorylation of
Cep55, which is critical for the function of Cep55 during
cytokinesis. Importantly, Pin1 knockdown does not enhance
the cytokinesis defect in Cep55-depleted cells, indicating that
Pin1 and Cep55 act in the same pathway. These data are the
first evidence that Pin1 regulates cytokinesis and may provide
a mechanistic explanation as to how pathologic levels of Pin1
can stimulate tumorigenesis. [Cancer Res 2009;69(16):6651–9]

Introduction
Cytokinesis is the final step of cell division in which the
cytoplasms of the two prospective daughter cells are separated
(reviewed in ref. 1). It is a multistep process that starts with the
ingression of the plasma membrane, mediated by the actomyosin
ring, and ends in abscission, which is controlled by the midbody
ring (2, 3). Failure of cytokinesis results in tetraploid cells, which
display increased chromosomal instability and are more tumorigenic compared with diploid cells (4).
The peptidyl-prolyl isomerase Pin1 is a member of the
evolutionary conserved family of peptidyl-prolyl isomerases and
regulates a diverse array of cellular processes such as cell cycle
progression and cellular stress responses (reviewed in ref. 5). Pin1
contains an NH2-terminal WW domain that is important for
protein-protein interactions and a COOH-terminal isomerase
domain that catalyzes the isomerization of substrates between
the cis and trans configuration, thereby inducing a conformational
change. Originally, Pin1 was shown to bind to a plethora of mitotic
phosphoproteins that are phosphorylated on phosphoserine- and
phosphothreonine-proline motifs (6–8). More recently, Pin1 has
also been shown to regulate nonmitotic proteins, such as FoxO

transcription factors and the tumor suppressor protein p53 (9–11).
These findings together led to the notion that Pin1 may be a
molecular timer of the cell cycle (12). Not surprisingly therefore,
Pin1 expression is abnormal in the majority of tumors (13).
Centrosome protein 55 kDa (Cep55) is a mitotic phosphoprotein
that localizes to the centrosome during mitosis and translocates to
the midbody ring during cytokinesis (14–16). Cep55 acts during
this last stage of cell division by regulating membrane fission and
fusion events near the midbody ring to allow abscission (16–18).
We previously reported that both overexpression and knockdown
of Cep55 cause cytokinesis defects, that is, a delay in completion of
abscission (also referred to as midbody arrest) and an increase in
the number of multinucleated cells (14). Notably, Cep55 is
overexpressed in a large number of tumors (19, 20) and is one
of 70 proteins in a chromosomal instability signature (21),
suggesting that aberrant expression of Cep55 could contribute to
tumorigenesis.
Cep55 is phosphorylated by the mitotic kinase Cdk1 on S425 and
S428, both of which are followed by a proline residue (14). These
two phosphoserine-proline motifs, which are conserved among
mammals, make Cep55 a potential Pin1 substrate. Cep55 is also
phosphorylated on S436 by Polo-like kinase 1 (Plk1) in a manner
dependent on the phosphorylation of S425 and S428. Notably,
phosphorylation of Cep55 on S436 is absolutely required for the
function of Cep55 during cytokinesis (14).
Although almost 20 years ago loss of the Saccharomyces
cerevisiae homologue of Pin1 was shown to result in multibudded
yeast (22), a phenomenon that is indicative of a cytokinesis defect,
a role for Pin1 in cytokinesis of mammalian cells has not been
shown to date. Here, we provide data indicating that Pin1 regulates
the final stages of mammalian cytokinesis. Cells lacking Pin1 and
cells that have low levels of Pin1 display cytokinesis defects.
Moreover, we show that Pin1 localizes to the midbody ring and that
it interacts with Cep55 in a manner dependent on phosphorylation
of Cep55 on S425 and S428. We show that functional Pin1 is
required for subsequent phosphorylation of Cep55 by Plk1 on S436.
Finally, we show that the midbody ring component Cep55 is a
major substrate of Pin1 for its function during cytokinesis. These
findings provide a new mechanism controlling cytokinesis that may
have implications for cancer initiation and/or progression.

Results
Pin1 regulates cytokinesis. As mutation of the yeast homologue of Pin1, Ess1, results in multibudded cells, we set out to study
a possible role for Pin1 in cytokinesis of mammalian cells. To this
end, we used previously described (10) Pin1 knockout MEFs
(Pin1 / MEFs; see Supplementary Fig. S1) and followed the
progression of these cells and MEFs expressing Pin1 (Pin1+/+)
through mitosis and cytokinesis by time-lapse microscopy. Pin1 /
MEFs displayed cleavage furrow ingression and midbody formation; however, these cells took twice as long to complete
cytokinesis ( from furrow ingression to midbody abscission)
compared with Pin1+/+ MEFs (Fig. 1A and B; see Supplementary
Movies S1 and S2). Subsequent immunofluorescence analysis of
fixed cells stained with anti-a-tubulin antibody revealed an f2fold higher number of dividing cells that were undergoing
cytokinesis (i.e., in midbody stage) in Pin1 / MEFs relative to
Pin1+/+ MEFs (Fig. 1C), supporting the above time-lapse results.
Moreover, overall, f7% of the Pin1 / MEFs displayed midbody
arrest and multinucleation, indicative of a cytokinesis defect,
compared with f2.5% for the Pin1+/+ MEFs (Fig. 1D). Together,
these data suggest a role for Pin1 in a late stage of cytokinesis.
As a complementary approach, we used a previously described
siRNA duplex against Pin1 (9) to deplete it from HeLa cells (see
Supplementary Fig. S2). In accordance with the cytokinesis
phenotype of Pin1 / MEFs, Pin1-depleted cells also displayed a
f2-fold delay in cytokinesis compared with control siRNA–
transfected cells (Fig. 2A and B; see Supplementary Movies S3
and S4). Moreover, Pin1 depletion resulted in an f3-fold increase
in the number of cells with a cytokinesis defect, that is,
multinucleated cells or cells arrested at the midbody stage
(midbody arrest; Fig. 2C). Subsequent analysis of exclusively
cytokinetic cells revealed that a majority of Pin1-depleted cells
were arrested at the midbody stage, characterized by decondensed
chromatin and interphase-like morphology, whereas most of the
cytokinetic control siRNA–treated cells displayed condensed
chromatin and rounded morphology (Fig. 2D; see Supplementary

Fig. S4). Notably, expression of a FLAG-Pin1 construct that is
insensitive to the Pin1 siRNA (Pin1-SM) reverted the phenotype
induced by the knockdown of Pin1 (Fig. 2D). We attribute the
phenotype of Pin1-depleted cells to prolonged cytokinesis due to
an abscission defect that allows the cells to adopt an interphase
(nonrounded) morphology. Importantly, the partial (f50–60%)
knockdown of Pin1 we obtained in HeLa cells as visualized by
Western blotting and immunofluorescence microscopy (see
Supplementary Figs. S2 and S3) was essential to minimize the
induction of adverse (pre-)mitotic defects documented previously
with profound depletion of Pin1 in these cells (6, 27) and therefore
allowed us to follow cells into cytokinesis. At the same time, we feel
that this partial knockdown precluded a strong siRNA-induced

cytokinesis defect. In agreement with this assumption, a second
siRNA against Pin1 (25), which caused a more profound
knockdown of Pin1, prevented the majority of cells recovering
from a nocodazole-induced mitotic arrest.1 Nevertheless, when
analyzing cells that reached cytokinesis, we observed a cytokinetic
phenotype similar to that induced by the first Pin1-specific siRNA
duplex (see Supplementary Figs. S4 and S5). Taken together, we
conclude that Pin1 plays a role in cytokinesis and we hypothesize
that Pin1 acts on a substrate that functions in resolution of the
midbody/abscission.

Pin1 interacts with Cep55 in vivo and in vitro. One candidate
protein that is involved in abscission (17, 18) and that contains two
potential Pin1 interaction motifs is Cep55 (see Supplementary
Fig. S6). We thus analyzed whether Pin1 interacts with Cep55 by
performing coimmunoprecipitations in 293T cells overexpressing
both proteins. Remarkably, the interaction between Pin1 and Cep55
was detected in mitotic (nocodazole arrested) cells but not in an
asynchronous population of cells (Fig. 3A). Furthermore, a mutant
form of Pin1 that lacks enzymatic activity also interacted with
Cep55 with a similar efficiency (see Supplementary Fig. S7),
consistent with earlier reports that isomerase-defective Pin1
mutants retain the ability to interact with substrates (28, 29).

Cancer Res 2009; 69: (16). August 15, 2009

Importantly, we could also detect an association between
endogenous Cep55 and FLAG-Pin1 (Fig. 3B). Taken together, these
data indicate that Pin1 binds to Cep55 in vivo during mitosis.
The putative Pin1 interaction motif of Cep55 consists of
phosphorylated S425 and S428, both of which are followed by a
proline (14). To confirm the interaction between Pin1 and Cep55
in vitro and to determine whether this interaction depends on these
mitosis-specific phosphorylation sites in Cep55, we performed GST
pull-down experiments. FLAG-tagged wild-type Cep55 in mitotic
extracts interacted with GST-Pin1 but not with GST alone or GSTPin1-W34A (a WW domain mutant that cannot interact with
phosphorylated substrates; Fig. 3C). Moreover, GST-Pin1 bound only

Pin1 Regulates Cytokinesis

weakly to the Cep55-S425/428A (serine mutated to alanine) mutant
compared with wild-type Cep55 and Cep55-S436A. Notably, the
slow-migrating band representing the phosphorylated wild-type
Cep55 protein was clearly enriched in the GST-Pin1 pull-downs
compared with the fast-migrating band representing Cep55 not
phosphorylated on S425 and S428 (compare total lysate and pulldown samples). In agreement with Pin1 interacting with phosphorylated Cep55, phosphatase pretreatment of mitotic extracts lowered
the amount of Cep55 that was pulled down with Pin1 in vitro (see
Supplementary Fig. S8). Together, these data indicate that Pin1
binds to Cep55 during mitosis in a manner dependent on
phosphorylation of S425 and S428 in Cep55.
Previous studies clearly showed that Cep55 localizes to centrosomes during mitosis and then translocates to the midbody ring
during cytokinesis (14–16). As Pin1 interacts with Cep55 in mitotic
cells, we determined whether Pin1 displays a similar localization
pattern. To this end, we performed immunofluorescence staining of
HeLa cells. In analogy with a previous report (30), we did not observe
Pin1 staining at the centrosomes in mitotic cells. However, we found
Pin1 staining at the midbody ring during cytokinesis (Fig. 3D). This
staining was specific as it was undetectable in Pin1-depleted cells.
Moreover, FLAG-Pin1 also localized to the midbody ring (see
Supplementary Fig. S9), reinforcing our findings that Pin1 is
recruited to the midbody ring during cytokinesis. Taken together,
these data strongly indicate that Pin1 binds to phosphorylated
Cep55 during mitosis and cytokinesis and suggest that these
proteins may cooperate to regulate the final stages of cell division.
Pin1 enhances Plk1-mediated phosphorylation of Cep55.
The interaction of Pin1 with Cep55 phosphorylated on S425 and
S428 shown here (see Fig. 3C) and the requirement of these two
phosphorylation events for Plk1-dependent phosphorylation of
Cep55 on S436, shown by us previously (14), led us to investigate
whether Pin1 regulates the phosphorylation of Cep55 on S436. To

assess this possibility in detail, we generated a rabbit polyclonal
phospho-specific antibody against phosphorylated S436 of Cep55.
To check the specificity of this antibody, we probed immunoprecipitates from 293T cells overexpressing wild-type Cep55 or
different phosphorylation site mutants with this antibody.
Consistent with dependence of S436 phosphorylation on prior
phosphorylation on both S425 and S428 (14), the phosphomimic
S425/428E mutant was strongly recognized by this phosphospecific antibody, whereas the S425/428A and S436A mutants
showed very weak or absent reactivity (Fig. 4A). To confirm that
Plk1 is the kinase responsible for phosphorylation of Cep55 on S436
(14), we immunoprecipitated FLAG-Cep55 from mitotic HeLa cells
with or without specific knockdown of Plk1. Plk1-depleted cells
displayed considerably lower levels of S436 phosphorylation
compared with control siRNA–treated cells (Fig. 4B), reinforcing
our previous findings that Plk1 phosphorylates Cep55 on S436 (14).
To analyze the kinetics of phosphorylation of Cep55-S436 during
cell cycle progression, Western blotting was performed on lysates
from synchronized HeLa cells. Phosphorylated Cep55-S436 was
almost undetectable at the G1-S boundary under thymidine block
and at the indicated times up to 8 hours after release. The
phosphorylation of Cep55-S436 was maximal 10 hours after release
from the block when the cells had entered mitosis (Fig. 4C). This
phosphorylation but not Cep55 protein levels diminished in the
next 4 hours during which cells progressed into the G1 phase of the
cell cycle. These data suggest that phosphorylation of Cep55-S436,
but not the protein itself, is lost around completion of cytokinesis.
Furthermore, these results imply that Plk1-mediated Cep55-S436
phosphorylation occurs early in mitosis when Cep55 is localized
at the centrosome and is still present during execution of cytokinesis when Cep55 is localized at the midbody ring. Indeed,
immunofluorescence microscopy analysis with the same antibody
revealed a signal on the centrosome from early mitosis to

anaphase, which then translocated to the midzone and subsequently to the midbody ring during cytokinesis (Fig. 4D).
Interphase cells as well as mitotic cells depleted of either Cep55
or Plk1 showed negative reactivity for the phospho-S436-Cep55
antibody (see Supplementary Fig. S10), showing that the antibody
specifically detects Cep55 phosphorylated on S436 by Plk1 during
mitosis and cytokinesis. Because the phosphorylation of Cep55 on
S436 does not seem to be important for its localization at the
midbody ring as shown previously (14) and in this study (see
Supplementary Fig. S11), we propose that this phosphorylation
event mediates the recruitment of one or more other proteins
involved in the regulation of cytokinesis. We are currently
investigating this possibility further.
We next tested whether Pin1 regulates phosphorylation of Cep55
on S436. To this end, FLAG-Cep55 was immunoprecipitated from

siRNA, and immunoprecipitates were analyzed using the phosphoS436-Cep55 antibody. Depletion of Pin1 resulted in a significant
reduction of Cep55-S436 phosphorylation (Fig. 5A). As Pin1 can
activate Cdk1 under certain circumstances (31, 32), we sought to
exclude the possibility that Pin1 regulates Cep55-S436 phosphorylation indirectly by enhancing phosphorylation of S425 and S428.
To this end, we compared the mobility shift of Cep55, which is
caused by Cep55-S425 and S428 phosphorylation (see Fig. 3C and
ref. 14), in Pin1-depleted and control cells and this remained
unaffected (Fig. 5B), indicating that Pin1 acts through a different
mechanism. This alternative mechanism does not seem to involve
a direct action at the level of Plk1, as Pin1 depletion had no
effect on Plk1 expression and its nocodazole-induced mobility shift
(Fig. 5B). We next studied the possibility that Pin1 regulates
binding of Plk1 to Cep55. Notably, expression of wild-type Pin1, but
not a Pin1 mutant (W34A) that cannot interact with substrates,

induced the binding between Plk1 and Cep55 (Fig. 5C). Moreover,
expression of an isomerase mutant form of Pin1 did not enhance
the interaction of Plk1 with Cep55 (see Supplementary Fig. S12).
These data indicate that both the integrity of the WW domain and
the isomerase activity of Pin1 are essential for the Plk1-Cep55
interaction. Taken together, we conclude that Pin1 binds to and
likely isomerizes Cep55 phosphorylated on S425 and S428, thereby
allowing Plk1 to bind to and phosphorylate Cep55 on S436.
Pin1 acts through Cep55 to regulate cytokinesis. Because
Pin1 plays a role in cytokinesis and regulates phosphorylation of
Cep55 on S436, which is important for abscission (14), we next
investigated whether Pin1 acts through Cep55 in regulating
cytokinesis. To this end, we depleted Pin1 and/or Cep55 from
HeLa cells (see Fig. 6C) and quantified the number of cells that
showed a midbody arrest (as in Fig. 2D). Knockdown of Pin1
resulted in a f2-fold increase in the number of cells showing a
midbody arrest (Fig. 6A), in agreement with observations in Fig. 2D
and Supplementary Fig. S4. Consistent with our previous report
(14), knockdown of Cep55 also increased the number of midbodyarrested cells. Importantly, knockdown of Pin1 in Cep55-depleted
cells did not result in a further increase in the number of cells that
showed a midbody arrest, indicating that Pin1 acts in the same
pathway as Cep55. In addition, when we counted the number of

observed that knockdown of Pin1 only increased the number of
cells with a cytokinesis defect in cells that expressed normal levels
of Cep55 (Fig. 6B), reinforcing the notion that Cep55 is an
important substrate of Pin1 acting in cytokinesis.

Discussion
In this study, we show that the peptidyl-prolyl isomerase Pin1
plays a role in cytokinesis. Pin1 localizes to the midbody ring, binds
to the midbody ring component Cep55, and regulates the final
stages of cytokinesis. Strikingly, cells that have no or low levels of
Pin1 display cytokinesis defects that, albeit weaker, are similar to
those seen in Cep55-deficient cells (i.e., delayed abscission and
failure of cytokinesis resulting in multinucleation). In support of a
direct interaction, siRNA-mediated knockdown of Pin1 expression
in Cep55-depleted cells does not further enhance the cytokinetic
defects of these cells. We further show that two phosphorylated
serines (S425 and S428) in Cep55 and the WW domain of Pin1 are
required for their interaction. Functional Pin1, but not a bindingor isomerase-defective mutant of Pin1, then enhances binding of
Plk1 to Cep55. Consistent with this, in Pin1-deficient cells, Cep55 is
hypophosphorylated on the Plk1 site S436, phosphorylation of
which is critical for proper execution of cytokinesis.
These findings suggest the following model (Fig. 6D): Pin1 binds to
Cep55 on mitotic entry when Cep55 is phosphorylated on S425 and
S428 by the trans conformation-specific and proline-directed kinase
Cdk1. This phosphorylation event itself probably induces a
conformational change to the cis conformation (5, 33). Subsequent
binding of Pin1 to Cep55 reverses this effect by inducing cis/trans
isomerization of Cep55, resulting in enhanced binding of Plk1 to
Cep55 to enable Plk1-mediated phosphorylation of Cep55 on S436
and completion of cytokinesis. As Pin1 binding to Cep55 occurs
during mitosis and because Pin1, like Cep55, localizes to the midbody
ring during cytokinesis, we propose that Pin1 tips the cis/trans
balance of Cep55 throughout mitosis and cytokinesis toward the
conformation that allows Plk1-mediated phosphorylation of Cep55S436. This conclusion is reinforced by our finding that phosphorylation of S436 is detectable throughout mitosis and cytokinesis.
We noted that the phenotype induced by Pin1 depletion occurs at
the same stage of cytokinesis as that caused by knockdown of Cep55
(i.e., at abscission) but that it is weaker. The latter could be explained
by the fact that Pin1 is an enzyme whose role is to accelerate the
conformational change of its substrates from cis to trans. This
conformational change is most likely only somewhat slower when
Pin1 levels are reduced by f2-fold. So, in many cells, such a depletion
of Pin1 may only delay cytokinesis as opposed to blocking it.
Pin1 has been shown to bind to Plk1 directly through its NH2terminal WW domain and as such could recruit Plk1 to Cep55
(34–36). However, as Pin1 isomerase mutants are capable of
interacting with Cep55 and Plk1 (35, 37) and because such a
mutant does not increase binding of Plk1 to Cep55, we conclude
that Pin1 enhances the interaction between Cep55 and Plk1 by
isomerizing Cep55 and not by recruiting Plk1. Although this is not
direct evidence of a catalytic role of Pin1 in promoting a
conformational change in Cep55, notably, Pin1 isomerase activity
is required to promote Plk1 binding to Cep55.
The Plk1-dependent phosphorylation of S436 in Cep55 is
important for normal execution of cytokinesis (14), although the
precise role of this phosphorylation event remains unclear at
present. We have shown that phosphorylation does not seem to be
required for the recruitment of Cep55 to the midbody ring and the
structure of this ring is not visibly disrupted in cells expressing
Cep55 phosphorylation site mutants (S425/S428A and S436A). We
therefore propose that phosphorylation of Cep55 may mediate the
interaction of Cep55 with other proteins that play a critical role in
regulation of cytokinesis, possibly in membrane fission and/or
fusion events involved in abscission. We have tested this possibility

Cancer Res 2009; 69: (16). August 15, 2009

by studying the previously described direct interaction between
Cep55 and Alix/AIP1 (17, 18). Whereas we could confirm the
interaction of Alix to Cep55, we did not observe a difference in
binding of Alix to wild-type Cep55 and the phospho-mutant Cep55S436A (data not shown). We are currently pursuing other
possibilities.
Cdk1 and Plk1 phosphorylate a plethora of substrates involved in
mitosis and/or cytokinesis. Interestingly, several of these substrates
are shared between Cdk1 and Plk1. For example, Cdc25C is
phosphorylated by Cdk1 in early mitosis, which enhances
subsequent Plk1-mediated phosphorylation that also occurs on
mitotic entry (38). Cep55 is similarly regulated by Cdk1 and Plk1.
Interestingly, Pin1 also interacts with Cdc25C and regulates its
activity through isomerization (31). It would therefore be of
particular interest to determine whether Pin1 modifies substrates
of Cdk1 other than Cep55 for subsequent phosphorylation by Plk1.
Moreover, several proteins that play a role in cytokinesis, such as
ECT2, MKLP1, MgcRacGAP, and PRC1 (39–42), have potential Pin1
binding motifs. We thus cannot exclude the possibility that, besides
functioning through Cep55, Pin1 might execute its cytokinetic role
also via one or more of these proteins.
As Pin1 is deregulated in many cancers (13) and because
cytokinesis defects can cause tumor formation (4), our findings
may provide a mechanistic link between aberrant expression of
Pin1 and cancer. Notably, in most tumors with deregulated Pin1
expression, Pin1 levels are higher compared with normal tissue.
Therefore, the findings as reported here could indicate that downregulation of Pin1 only causes a cytokinesis defect in specific
cellular backgrounds. Alternatively, as observed for other proteins
involved in cytokinesis such as Cep55, where both overexpression
and down-regulation can lead to defective cytokinesis, it is possible
that up-regulation of Pin1 also gives rise to a cytokinesis defect.
This defect could eventually lead to aneuploidy and aggressive
tumor growth. Consistent with this, overexpression of Pin1 has
been linked to poor prognosis (43, 44).
In summary, our findings provide mechanistic insight into a
previously unappreciated role for Pin1 in cytokinesis. Furthermore,
our findings add to the notion that Pin1 might be a molecular
timer of the cell cycle by including cytokinesis in the list of cell
cycle phases/events that are regulated by Pin1 (12). Strikingly, we
show the existence of a Cdk1-Pin1-Plk1 axis in which Pin1 binds to
proteins containing Cdk1 phosphorylation sites and promotes their
phosphorylation by Plk1. As aberrant cytokinesis seems to be an
early event in tumorigenesis, basic knowledge about proteins that
play a role in the regulation of cytokinesis may lead to the
development of novel cancer therapeutics.
