BACKGROUND: The authors conducted a phase 1/2 study of tipifarnib in combination with idarubicin and cytarabine
(IA) in 95 patients with previously untreated acute myeloid leukemia (AML) or high-risk myelodysplastic syndrome.
METHODS: Induction consisted of idarubicin 12 mg/m2 a day on days 1-3, cytarabine 1.5 g/m2 intravenously continuously daily on days 1-4 (days 1-3 if age 60 years), and tipifarnib, with the first cohort (n ¼ 6) receiving 200 mg orally
twice a day and all others receiving 300 mg twice a day for 21 days every 28 days. Consolidation consisted of 5
courses of idarubicin 8 mg/m2 a day on days 1-2, cytarabine 0.75 g/m2 a day on days 1-3, and tipifarnib 300 mg twice
a day for 14 days every 4-6 weeks. Maintenance with tipifarnib 300 mg twice a day for 21 days every 4-6 weeks was
continued for 6 months. RESULTS: With a median follow-up of 33 months, 61 patients achieved complete remission
(CR) (64%), and 9 achieved complete remission with incomplete platelet recovery (CRp) (9%). The median duration
of CR was not reached. Median overall survival was 17 months. The most common grade 3 adverse events were gastrointestinal toxicities, liver dysfunction, and skin rash. Compared with historical IA, IA and tipifarnib showed a better
CR duration (P ¼ .04) and a trend toward a higher CR rate in patients with chromosome 5/7 abnormalities. CONCLUSIONS: The combination of IA and tipifarnib is safe and active. Further studies exploring different dosages and

KEYWORDS: acute myeloid leukemia, tipifarnib, combination, myelodysplastic syndrome, farnesyl transferase inhibitor.

The backbone of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) therapy remains centered on cytarabine in combination with an
anthracycline such as idarubicin or daunorubicin. Approximately 50% to 70% of patients achieve complete remission
(CR), but most will relapse and succumb to their disease or associated complications.1-3 Patients with high-risk myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS; defined by marrow blasts >10%) are also frequently treated with AML regimens, hypomethylating agents, and/or allogeneic stem cell transplantation. However, they have a poor outcome, with a median survival of 12
months or less.4-9 Therefore, new therapies and more effective treatment regimens are needed.
Farnesyltransferase inhibitors are a novel class of anticancer agents that competitively inhibit farnesyltransferase
(FTase), an enzyme that catalyzes the transfer of a farnesyl moiety to the C-terminal cysteine residue of substrate proteins.10 A host of intracellular proteins, substrates for prenylation via FTase, play a role in the growth and proliferation of
AML cells.11 Interruption of prenylation may prevent substrates from being functional, which, in turn, may result in the
inhibition of cellular events that depend on the function of those substrates. Tipifarnib is an orally available, nonpeptidomimetic farnesyltransferase inhibitor (FTI) with significant in vitro antitumor activity across a wide range of tumors.12
Tipifarnib has shown clinical activity in myeloid malignancies including in those in elderly patients with AML, high-risk

MDS, and myeloproliferative disorders.13-18 In a phase 1
study in patients with refractory leukemias, tipifarnib
induced a response rate of 29%, including 2 CRs.15 The
treatment was generally well tolerated, with the major toxicities consisting of mild to moderate myelosuppression,
nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea at the maximum tolerated
dose (MTD) of 600 mg twice daily. In a phase 2 study
using 600 mg twice a day for 21 days every 4 weeks in previously untreated elderly patients and those with refractory
or relapsed AML, a CR rate of 14% was reported.17 In
patients with MDS treated at 600 mg twice a day for 28
days every 6 weeks, a response rate of 30% was reported.16
The favorable toxicity profile, antileukemic activity,
and novel mechanism of action of tipifarnib make it
attractive for use in combination therapy. Several studies
had suggested a synergy between tipifarnib and chemotherapeutic agents, and FTIs have been suggested to
inhibit multidrug resistance, a common mechanism of resistance to chemotherapy in AML, particularly among the
elderly.19,20 In vitro studies showed that the antiproliferative effects in human AML cells are additive when tipifarnib is combined with cladribine or fludarabine21 and
synergistic when tipifarnib is combined with bortezomib22 or daunorubicin,20 possibly reflecting, in the latter
case, competitive inhibition of P-glycoprotein.
The goal of the current study was to investigate the
combination of tipifarnib with an established induction
therapy regimen of idarubicin and cytarabine in patients
with AML and high-risk MDS.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study Group
Previously untreated adults with AML (defined by 20%
blasts) or high-risk MDS (>10% blasts) ages 15 to 70 years
were eligible after informed consent was obtained according to institutional guidelines. Previous therapy with
hydroxyurea (but no other chemotherapy) and hematopoietic growth factors was allowed. Additional eligibility
criteria were: 1) Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group
(ECOG) performance status 0 or 1; 2) adequate liver function (serum bilirubin 2 mg/dL, alanine aminotransferase
[ALT] or aspartate aminotransferase up to 2.5  the upper
limit of normal) and renal function (serum creatinine 2
mg/dL); 3) ability to take oral medication; 4) absence of
the chromosomal translocation t(15;17); 5) absence of any
active and uncontrolled infection or any other severe concurrent disease; and 6) no known allergy to imidazole
drugs. Nursing and pregnant women were excluded. Ap-

proval for the study was granted by the institutional review
board of The University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer
Center. The study was conducted in accordance with the
basic principles of the Declaration of Helsinki.
Treatment Schedule
The treatment plan consisted of induction therapy with
cytarabine 1.5 g/m2 over 24 hours daily on days 1-4 (age
<60 years) or days 1-3 (age 60 years) and idarubicin
12 mg/m2 intravenously over 1 hour daily on days 1-3.
Patients achieving a response received consolidation with
5 additional courses every 4-6 weeks with cytarabine 0.75
g/m2 over 24 hours daily for 3 days and idarubicin 8 mg/
m2 intravenously over 1 hour daily for 2 days. Tipifarnib
was given twice a day for 21 days during induction therapy, for 14 days with each course of consolidation, and as
a single agent for maintenance therapy for 3 weeks every
4-6 weeks for 6 courses.
Tipifarnib was given at a dose of 200 mg orally twice
a day for the first 6 patients to determine tolerability and
at the target dose of 300 mg orally twice a day during
induction, consolidation, and maintenance to all other
patients after no unexpected toxicity was identified in
patients treated at the lower dose. Toxicity was graded
according to the NCI Common Terminology Criteria
version 3.0. During induction therapy, patients who experienced grades 3-4 extramedullary toxicities, prolonged
myelosuppression, or life-threatening myelosuppressionrelated complications and who were not in CR after
1 course received a second induction course at 2 dose
level. Patients who experienced grade 2 extramedullary
toxicities received the second course at 1 dose level (Table 1). Patients who developed toxicity requiring dose
reduction at the lowest dose level of tipifarnib were taken
off the study. Patients who showed no significant antitumor effect after 2 courses were taken off the study. During
consolidation, the dose of chemotherapy treatment in
subsequent courses was reduced by 25% for grades 3-4
extramedullary toxicities, or for severe life-threatening

1237

infections. The dose of tipifarnib was similarly reduced to
the next lower dose, that is, 200 or 100 mg twice a day.
The pretreatment evaluation included history, physical examination, complete blood count (CBC) with differential and platelet count, a complete chemistry survey, and
marrow aspiration with cytogenetic analysis. Follow-up
studies included CBC, differential, and platelet count as
well as chemistry profile every 4-7 days during remission
induction and every 1-4 weeks during maintenance therapy.
Marrow aspiration and cytogenetics (if abnormal at start)
were performed on days 21-28 and then an aspiration every
1-2 weeks as required until CR, then every 3-6 months in
year 1. Supportive measures for optimal medical care were
provided throughout the study and included admission to a
laminar air flow room for the duration of the induction for
patients 50 years old, use of prophylactic antibiotics, and
irradiated blood-product support as indicated.
Response Criteria
A CR required bone marrow blasts 5% and recovery of
normal hematopoiesis with an absolute neutrophil count
(ANC) of 1  109/L or more and platelet count of 100 
109/L or more in addition to disappearance of all clinical
or radiologic evidence of disease. CRp had similar criteria
to CR but with platelet counts from 20 to <100  109/L.
Partial response (PR) required blood recovery as for CR
but with both a decrease in marrow blasts of 50% and
25% abnormal cells in the marrow.
Statistical Analysis
The trial objectives were to assess the safety and tolerability of tipifarnib when used in combination with idarubicin and cytarabine as initial therapy for patients with
AML. To further assess the possible impact of adding tipifarnib, results were compared with a historical cohort of
patients treated with the same chemotherapy but without
tipifarnib. The impact of clinical features on outcome was
an exploratory endpoint.
Because this combination had not been used before,
an initial cohort of 6 patients was first treated at a reduced
dose of tipifarnib. Once the lower-dose tipifarnib combination was determined to be safe, patients were treated
with the target dose (ie, 300 mg twice a day) to a maximum
of 90 patients. The target dose would start accrual if grades
3-4 toxicity attributable to tipifarnib was observed in fewer
than 2 of the 6 patients treated at the 200-mg twice-daily
dose. Patients who were eligible for the trial and received
any dose of idarubicin, cytarabine, or tipifarnib were
included in estimating CR rates and were counted as treat-

1238

ment failures if response could not be assessed for any reason. Duration of CR and overall survival were estimated
according to the Kaplan-Meier method. CR duration was
dated from the start of CR to first evidence of recurrence.
The efficacy and toxicity profile of this combination were
compared with the historical M. D. Anderson experience
with 108 consecutive patients having the same inclusion
criteria and treated with the same chemotherapy without
tipifarnib between 2001 and 2005.
For the phase 2 portion of the study, the design was
adapted to account for patient characteristics. The trial
would be terminated after the first 45 patients were evaluated if 20 or fewer CRs were observed. With the trial
continuing to maximum accrual of 90 patients, the combination regimen would be recommended for further
study in this group of patients if at least 58 CRs were
observed. The probability that the combination would be
recommended under the assumption of a CR rate of 74%
was .91. Outcome by other disease characteristics was
assessed in a descriptive manner.

RESULTS
Study Group
A total of 95 patients were enrolled in the study: 6 at the
lower dose and 89 at the target tipifarnib dose of 300 mg
twice a day. The patient characteristics are summarized in
Table 2. The median age was 50 years (range, 17-61
years). Sixty-three patients (66%) had an ECOG performance status of 1. There were 82 patients with AML as
defined by the World Health Organization classification
(20% blasts as the cutoff between AML and high-risk
MDS). Forty patients (42%) had antecedent hematologic
disorders prior to their diagnosis, for a median of 2
months (range, 1-108 months). More than half the
patients had abnormal karyotypes, which included abnormalities of chromosomes 5 and/or 7 in 19 patients (20%),
translocation t(8:21) in 2 (2%), inversion 16 in 3 (3%),
and other abnormalities in 29 (31%). Of 83 patients
whose marrow samples were tested for FLT3 abnormalities, 13 (16%) showed internal tandem duplications
(ITDs), and 6 (7%) showed mutations in aspartic acid residue 835 (D835) of the tyrosine kinase loop (2 patients
had both mutations).
Response and Outcome
Sixty-one patients (64%) achieved CR and 9 (9%) CRp,
for an overall response rate of 74%. Twenty-one patients
(22%) had resistant disease, and 4 (4%) died during

26% (Table 3). Of 41 patients with diploid cytogenetics,
30 (73%) had CR and 4 (10%) CRp (OR, 83%). The CR
rate was 58% (11 of 19) in patients with abnormalities of
chromosomes 5 and/or 7 and 55% (16 of 29) in those
harboring other cytogenetic abnormalities. The CR rates

unfavorable cytogenetic analysis. Seventeen patients had
abnormalities of FLT3 in the form of ITDs and/or D835.
CR rates were 67% (44 of 66) in FLT3 wild-type patients
and 76% (13 of 17) in those with FLT3 mutations.
Three patients (1 diploid and 2 abnormal cytogenetics) who failed to achieve CR following the first induction
course received a second induction with identical doses
and schedules of tipifarnib and IA; none of them achieved
CR. Median time to CR was 30 days (range, 21-71 days)
for all patients, 29 days (range, 21 to 60 days) in the diploid group, and 34 days (range, 23-71 days) in the abnormal cytogenetic group. Median time to CRp was 31 days
(range, 18-67 days).
Four patients (4%) died during the first induction
course. One patient (age 43 years) had an acute myocardial infarction, followed by congestive heart failure, and
died on day 8 of the induction course. A 28-year-old
patient had sepsis, with disseminated intravascular coagulopathy, and died on day 11. One 52-year-old patient
developed a diffuse alveolar hemorrhage and probable
fungal pneumonia and died on day 27. One patient (age
44 years) had concomitant bacterial and fungal septicemia
that led to multiple organ failure; he died on day 55 before
recovering his counts.
Overall, 70 patients received a total of 152 courses
of consolidation therapy. Seventeen patients received only

1 cycle of consolidation, 9 received 2, and 26 received 3 or
more, with 19 completing all 5 planned cycles. The main
reasons for not completing consolidation chemotherapy
as planned were allogeneic stem cell transplantation (n ¼
18), treatment toxicities (n ¼ 14), and disease relapse (n
¼ 13). Seventeen patients received a total of 82 courses of
maintenance therapy with tipifarnib at a median dose of
100 mg twice a day (range, 100-200 mg twice a day), for
a median of 5 months (range,1-8 months). Of the 17
patients, 8 remained in remission for 50þ months (range,
45 to 64þ months), whereas 9 patients relapsed after a
median of 18 months (range, 12-34 months), 5 of whom
later died after a median of 22 months (range, 14-34
months). Eighteen patients (median age, 52 years; range,
34-60 years) received consolidation therapy with allogeneic stem cell transplantation: 16 in CR and 2 in CRp.
Five of them (28%) had chromosome 5 or 7 abnormalities
compared with 14 of 77 (18%) who did not receive transplantation (P ¼ .16). Of the 18 transplanted patients, 6
(33%; 1 with chromosome 7 abnormality) were alive 22þ
months (range, 11 to 33þ months) after transplantation,
5 (28%) relapsed and died, and 7 (39%) died in CR or
CRp of transplant-related complications.
With a median follow-up of 33 months (range, 2350 months), 27 of 61 patients who achieved CR (44%)
were still in remission (6 after transplant). The median
remission duration for all patients who achieved CR was
not reached (range, 1 to >49 months). In contrast,
patients who achieved CRp had a median remission duration of only 3 months (range, 1-35 months). Median
overall survival for the intent-to-treat population was 17

Side Effects
No grades 3-4 tipifarnib-related toxicities were observed
among the first 6 patients enrolled in the phase 1 portion
of the study and who received tipifarnib 200 mg twice a
day; therefore, the dose of tipifarnib was increased to 300
mg twice a day and was given to 89 patients enrolled in
part 2 of the study. Table 4 summarizes the toxicities
observed with the combination therapy during induction.
The most frequently observed side effects were diarrhea,
nausea and vomiting, skin rash, mucositis, and hyperbilirubinemia. Tipifarnib was held for a median of 5 days
(range, 0-18 days) during induction therapy. Fifty-three
patients (56%) had tipifarnib dose reductions during
induction, 21 (40%) during consolidation, and 3 (18%)
during maintenance. The most common causes for treatment interruption and dose reduction were gastrointestinal toxicities, prolonged myelosuppression, and sepsis.
During consolidation, the median time to neutrophil recovery (ANC 1  109/L) was 26 days (range, 0-64 days)
and for platelet recovery (100  109/L) was 37 days

grades 3-4 during maintenance therapy were uncommon.
Median time to next course was 43 days (range, 15-161
days) during consolidation and 32 days (range, 24-154
days) during maintenance. Tipifarnib was given at a dose
of 200 mg twice a day in 96 of the 152 cycles of consolidation (63%) and in 44 of the 83 cycles of maintenance
(53%) and at 100 mg twice a day in 31 cycles of consolidation (20%) and in 23 cycles of maintenance (28%).
Comparison With Historical Patients
Receiving Idarubicin and Cytarabine
We compared the efficacy and safety of tipifarnib-based
combination with historical experience at M. D. Anderson using the same chemotherapy without tipifarnib in
matched patients (by age and year of treatment) receiving
idarubicin and cytarabine therapy (Table 5). The objective response rates were similar. There was a trend for
higher CR rates in favor of patients with chromosome 5
and 7 abnormalities treated with the tipifarnib-based
combination (58% vs 19%; P ¼ .054), but there was no
effect on survival (P ¼ .12). The median number of consolidation courses for patients who achieved CR treated
with chemotherapy was 3 (range, 1-5), compared with 4
(range, 0-4) for those in the historical control group.
There was a better median complete remission duration
(CRD) with the tipifarnib-based combinations: the median CRD was not reached for patients treated with tipifarnib-based combinations and was 13 months with
chemotherapy alone (P ¼ .04); the 18-month CRD rates
were 54% and 38%, respectively (Fig. 2). Median overall
survival rates were 17 versus 13 months; the 18-month

survival rates were 48% and 41% (P ¼ .27; Fig. 3).
Patients receiving tipifarnib-based combinations had a
higher rate of grades 3-4 diarrhea (35% versus 8%; P <
.001). The 6- and 12-week mortality rates were 3% and
12%, respectively, with the tipifarnib-based therapy versus 8% and 16%, respectively, with chemotherapy alone
(P ¼ .27).

days every 28-day cycle, reported CR rates of 4% in
patients with refractory disease and 14% in elderly
patients with previously untreated AML.17-23 In this
study, using tipifarnib 300 mg orally twice a day in combination with idarubicin and cytarabine, a CR rate of
64% was achieved with an acceptable safety profile. Median survival was 17 months, and median CR duration
was 19 months.
Overall, this study did not demonstrate any significantly increased antileukemia activity with the addition of
tipifarnib. Except for a possible trend toward more durable responses with the tipifarnib-based combination compared with historical controls, the CR and survival rates
were not different from what would be expected with
chemotherapy alone. In our study, the dose of tipifarnib
was 300 mg twice a day, lower than the MTD identified
in the phase 1 trial (600 mg twice a day given for 21 days
every 28 days), and in more than 50% of the consolidation courses, tipifarnib was reduced to 100-200 mg twice
a day. A recent report found no apparent increase in
response rate with higher tipifarnib doses when used as a
single agent; therefore, the benefit of a higher dose intensity is unclear.24 Despite the possible trend for more durable responses, the role of tipifarnib and the contribution
of the extended therapy during consolidation and maintenance can only be assessed in a randomized trial.
Other studies have failed also to demonstrate a considerable benefit of tipifarnib used alone or in combination with chemotherapy. Brandwein et al failed to show a
significant benefit by adding tipifarnib to chemotherapy.25 In their study, the combination of tipifarnib, given
at a dose of 600 mg twice a day for 10 days per cycle, and

conventional ‘‘3 þ 7’’ induced an objective response rate
of 54% in previously untreated patients with AML ages
60 years and older; this rate was not significantly different
from what was obtained with chemotherapy alone. A
phase 3 randomized trial in patients with AML aged 70
years and older randomized to tipifarnib versus best supportive care did not show a survival advantage for tipifarnib. The CR rate in that study was only 8%.26
Although the response rates to tipifarnib as a single
agent may be independent of the cytogenetic risk group,17
the CR rate in the present study for patients with adverse
risk cytogenetics (58%) was higher than the response rate
of 19% in patients treated with identical chemotherapy in
the historical cohort. This is in line with a previous report
from Brandwein et al, who reported a response rate of
57% in patients receiving tipifarnib-based combination
versus 30% in patients treated with standard induction
regimen.25 Karp et al also reported that tipifarnib maintenance may benefit patients with secondary AML and
adverse cytogenetics; the CRD was longer in patients who
received tipifarnib maintenance therapy compared with
that in the historical control (HR, 0.11; P ¼ .02).27 Based
on these observations, patients with adverse cytogenetics
might be a subset in whom further exploration of tipifarnib-based chemotherapy combinations may be warranted.
Furthermore, Raponi and colleagues have identified and
validated a 2-gene expression ratio, RASGRP1/APTX, that
has predictive utility in both newly diagnosed and
relapsed or refractory AML treated with tipifarnib.28 The
stratification with this classifier significantly predicts for
improved overall survival that is independent of other
prognostic factors including a previously described
genomic signature. Similarly, in 11 patients with
relapsed/refractory mantle cell lymphoma treated with
tipifarnib, the RASGRP1/APTX gene expression ratio was
higher in the responder, whereas AKAP13 expression was
higher in the nonresponders.29 This gene analysis was not
available for the present study, but it is possible that
patients could be selected this way in future studies to
identify those most likely to benefit.
The combination regimen was well tolerated. The
major toxicities were gastrointestinal, including transient
liver test abnormalities, nausea and vomiting, diarrhea,
and mucositis. Except for diarrhea, the toxicities were not
substantially more than those observed with standard
chemotherapy alone. Gastrointestinal toxicities were
frequently seen with tipifarnib single-agent therapy,
although this was observed at higher doses.15 In a recent
phase 1 study combining tipifarnib and standard

induction therapy in elderly patients, more severe gastrointestinal toxicities were reported at a dose of 600 mg
twice a day.25 Although myelosuppression is a common
toxicity of tipifarnib, there was no significant prolonged
myelosuppression, and the median time to neutrophil and
platelet recovery was comparable to that observed with
standard chemotherapy alone. There was no increase in
the 6- and 12-week mortality rates.
In summary, the results of this study suggest that the
combination of idarubicin, cytarabine, and tipifarnib in
patients with AML and high-risk MDS can be safely
administered. A possible benefit of this combination
among patients with high-risk cytogenetic abnormalities
deserves additional investigation.
