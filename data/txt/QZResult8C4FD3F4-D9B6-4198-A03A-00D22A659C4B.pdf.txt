Abstract
The aggressive course of pancreatic cancer is believed to reflect its unusually invasive and metastatic nature, which is associated with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) overexpression and NF-κB activation.
MicroRNAs (miRNA) have been implicated in the regulation of various pathobiological processes in cancer,
including metastasis in pancreatic cancer and in other human malignancies. In this study, we report lower
expression of miR-146a in pancreatic cancer cells compared with normal human pancreatic duct epithelial
cells. Reexpression of miR-146a inhibited the invasive capacity of pancreatic cancer cells with concomitant
downregulation of EGFR and the NF-κB regulatory kinase interleukin 1 receptor–associated kinase 1
(IRAK-1). Cellular mechanism studies revealed crosstalk between EGFR, IRAK-1, IκBα, NF-κB, and MTA-2,
a transcription factor that regulates metastasis. Treatment of pancreatic cancer cells with the natural products
3,3′-diinodolylmethane (DIM) or isoflavone, which increased miR-146a expression, caused a downregulation of
EGFR, MTA-2, IRAK-1, and NF-κB, resulting in an inhibition of pancreatic cancer cell invasion. Our findings
reveal DIM and isoflavone as nontoxic activators of a miRNA that can block pancreatic cancer cell invasion
and metastasis, offering starting points to design novel anticancer agents. Cancer Res; 70(4); 1486–95. ©2010 AACR.

Introduction
Pancreatic cancer is an aggressive malignancy with one of
the worst outcomes among all cancers. For all stages combined, the 5-year relative survival rate is only 5% (1). The high
mortality of pancreatic cancer could be partly due to the ability of pancreatic cancer cells to acquire invasive characteristics during the early stages of carcinogenesis. Thus, most
patients diagnosed with pancreatic cancer are unresectable
and usually die from metastatic disease even after treatment
with existing therapies. Therefore, there is a dire need for understanding the molecular mechanism(s) involved in the aggressiveness of pancreatic cancer and its high propensity for
metastasis, and further novel approaches are needed for developing novel therapeutic strategies for the inhibition of tumor
aggressiveness and metastasis so that the patients diagnosed
with pancreatic cancer could be treated with better outcome.
It has been reported that overexpression of epidermal
growth factor receptor (EGFR) and activation of NF-κB are
common in pancreatic cancer (2, 3). Elevated expression
of EGFR and its ligand correlates with large tumor size,
advanced clinical staging, and decreased survival period in
pancreatic cancer (4). The constitutive activation of NF-κB,
which regulates important genes and thereby affects many

cellular processes, is also known to contribute to the aggressive behavior of pancreatic cancer (3, 5). However, the molecular mechanism(s) involved in the overexpression of EGFR
and activation of NF-κB in pancreatic cancer have not been
fully elucidated.
Recently, emerging evidence indicates the critical role of
microRNAs (miRNA) in the regulation of various biological
and pathologic processes, including metastasis (6). These
small, noncoding molecules elicit their regulatory effects by
imperfectly binding to the 3′ untranslated region of target
mRNA, causing either degradation of mRNA or inhibition
of their translation to functional proteins (7). The expression
of miRNAs has been recognized as integral components of
many normal biological processes involving cell proliferation,
differentiation, apoptosis, and stress resistance (8). More importantly, it has been recently suggested that aberrant upregulation or downregulation of specific miRNAs and their
targets in various types of cancer is associated with the development and progression of cancer (9–11). Moreover, miR-146a
has been found to be lost in metastatic prostate cancer (12),
and its expression reduces the metastatic potential of breast
cancer cells through repression of interleukin 1 receptor–
associated kinase 1 (IRAK-1) and subsequent inhibition of
NF-κB activity (13, 14). In addition, miR-146a could target
EGFR based on predicted base pairing by using miRBase analysis (15). Therefore, it is important to unravel the relationship
between miR-146a and the signaling of EGFR and NF-κB. It is
also important to find novel agents that could regulate miR146, EGFR, and NF-κB, and that could be useful for the inhibition of pancreatic cancer progression and metastasis.
We have previously found that dietary compounds, including isoflavone genistein and 3,3′-diindolylmethane (DIM),
could enhance the antitumor activity of chemotherapeutic
agents through the inhibition of NF-κB (16, 17). However,

the precise molecular mechanisms by which these dietary
compounds regulate NF-κB have not been fully elucidated. In
this study, we assessed the expression pattern of miRNAs in the
normal pancreatic duct epithelial cells and pancreatic cancer
cells. We also investigated whether the treatment of pancreatic
cancer cells with either B-DIM (BioResponse formulated DIM
with greater bioavailability) or G2535 (a mixture of genistein
and other isoflavones) could alter the expression of miRNAs
and their targets that are involved in the processes of invasion and metastasis. We found that B-DIM and G2535 could
inhibit invasion of pancreatic cancer cells through the induction of miR-146a and with corresponding downregulation of its
targets, including IRAK-1/NF-κB, EGFR, and metastasisassociated protein 2 (MTA-2), suggesting that reexpression of
specific miRNA by nontoxic “natural agents” could be a useful
strategy for the treatment of pancreatic cancer in the future.

Materials and Methods
Cell lines, reagents, and antibodies. Colo357 and Panc-1
pancreatic cancer cells were maintained in DMEM (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/
mL penicillin, and 100 μg/mL streptomycin in a 5% CO2 atmosphere at 37°C. Human pancreatic duct epithelial (HPDE)
cells were obtained from M.D. Anderson Cancer Center (a
generous gift of Dr. Paul J. Chiao) and cultured in keratinocyte serum-free medium supplied with 5 ng/mL of epidermal
growth factor and 50 μg/mL of bovine pituitary extract (Invitrogen; ref. 18). The cell lines have been tested and authenticated in core facility Applied Genomics Technology Center
at Wayne State University. The method used for testing was
short tandem repeat profiling using the PowerPlex 16 System
from Promega. B-DIM (BioResponse; known as BR-DIM and
referred to as B-DIM with higher bioavailability in vivo; ref.
19) was generously provided by Dr. Michael Zeligs (BioResponse LLC, Boulder, CO) and was dissolved in DMSO to
make a 50 mmol/L stock solution. Isoflavone mixture
G2535 (70.54% genistein, 26.34% diadzin, and 0.31% glycitein,
manufactured by Organic Technologies and obtained from
the NIH) was dissolved in DMSO to make a stock solution
containing 50 mmol/L equivalent to genistein. The concentration of isoflavone we described in this article all refer to
the concentration of genistein in the isoflavone mixture. The
EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor erlotinib was a generous gift
from OSI Pharmaceuticals. Anti-EGFR (Cell Signaling), anti–
phospho-EGFR Tyr992 (Cell Signaling), anti–IRAK-1 (Santa

www.aacrjournals.org

Cruz Biotechnology), anti–MTA-2 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti–NF-κB p65 (Millipore), anti-IκBα (Cell Signaling),
anti–phospho-IκBα (Cell Signaling), and anti–β-actin (Sigma) primary antibodies were used for Western blot analysis.
RNA isolation. Total RNA was extracted by using the
mirVana miRNA Isolation Kit (Ambion, Inc.) following the
protocol provided by the manufacturer. Briefly, Colo357
and Panc-1 cells were treated with 25 μmol/L B-DIM or
25 μmol/L G2535 for 48 h. Control cells received 0.05%
DMSO. Then, the pancreatic cancer cells from each condition
and the HPDE cells were subjected to RNA extraction following the procedure we reported previously (20).
miRNA array and data analysis. Five micrograms of each
total RNA sample from HPDE, Colo357, and Panc-1 cells were
sent to a service provider for completion of the miRNA arrays
(LCSciences). In LCSciences, the total RNA samples were enriched for microRNAs and the miRNA arrays were performed
on μParaFlo microfluidic chips (version 10.0), each of which
has a miRNA probe region with multiple repeat regions that
detect 711 miRNAs. Multiple control probes are also included
on the arrays for assessing various chip and assay qualities,
such as uniformity and specificity. Chips were scanned and
the signal intensity data were obtained. Then, the data was
analyzed by subtracting the background and normalizing the
signals to balance the intensities of transcripts in normal, cancer, control, and treatment samples so that differential expression ratios can be calculated. The ratio of the two sets of
detected signals, such as normal and cancer and control
and treatment, was calculated. The t test was also performed
to calculate the P value. The predicting target genes for various miRNAs were also analyzed using computerized analysis.3
miRNA real-time reverse transcriptase-PCR. To verify
the alteration in the expression of miR-146a that was found
in miRNA array analysis, we conducted real-time miRNA reverse transcriptase-PCR (RT-PCR) analysis using miR-146a
TaqMan MicroRNA Assay Kit (Applied Biosystems) following
the procedure we reported previously (20).
Real-time RT-PCR using mRNA. Real-time RT-PCR analysis was also conducted to measure the expression of EGFR in
pancreatic cancer cells with and without 25 μmol/L B-DIM
or 25 μmol/L G2535 treatment following the procedure we
reported previously (20). The t test was also performed to
calculate the P value for EGFR mRNA and miR-146a data.

secondary antibody conjugated with peroxidase (Bio-Rad).
The signal was detected using the chemiluminescent detection system (Pierce). The signal of each target protein expression was scanned and quantified by using AlphaEaseFC
(Alpha Innotech). The ratios of detected target proteins
against β-actin were calculated, with standardization of the
ratio of each control to the unit value.
Reexpression and inhibition of miR-146a in pancreatic
cancer cells. Colo357 and Panc-1 cells were seeded in sixwell plates and transfected with miR-146a, miRNA-negative
control, anti–miR-146, or anti–miR-negative control (Ambion) at a final concentration of 20 nmol/L using DharmaFect Transfection Reagent (Dharmacon). After 3 d of
transfection, the cells were split and transfected repeatedly
with the miRNA or anti-miRNA every 3 to 4 d for indicated
periods of time. Total RNA from each samples were then extracted using the Trizol reagent (Invitrogen). One microgram
of RNA was subjected to RT-PCR using the High Capacity
RNA-to-cDNA Kit (Applied Biosystems) and SYBR Green
PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems) as described earlier.
Total proteins from each sample were also extracted and
subjected to Western blot analysis as described previously.
Cytoplasmic and nuclear proteins were also extracted
and subjected to Western blot analysis and electrophoretic
mobility shift assay (EMSA).
Inhibition of EGFR expression by siRNA in pancreatic
cancer cells. Colo357 and Panc-1 cells were seeded in a
six-well plate (1.2 × 105 cells per well) and incubated at
37°C for 24 h. The cells were then transfected with EGFR siRNA
(Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or control RNA duplex by DharmaFect Transfection Reagent (Dharmacon) for 72 h. Then,
the total, cytoplasmic, and nuclear proteins were extracted.
The proteins were subjected to Western blot analysis.
Electrophoretic mobility shift assay. EMSA was conducted to measure the DNA-binding activity of NF-κB in
miR-146a–transfected or B-DIM and G2535-treated Colo357
and Panc-1 cells. Briefly, after transfection or treatment,
nuclear proteins from each sample were extracted and
subjected to EMSA following the standard procedure we reported previously (17).
Invasion assay. The invasive capacity of Colo357 and Panc1 cells with miR-146a or anti–miR-146 transfection or after
different treatments were tested by using BD BioCoat Tumor
Invasion Assay System (BD Biosciences) according to the
manufacturer's protocol with minor modification. Briefly,
Colo357 and Panc-1 cells were transfected with miR-146a or
anti–miR-146 for 5 d as described above and/or treated with
25 μmol/L B-DIM or 25 μmol/L G2535 for 2 d. Then, the
transfected or treated Colo357 and Panc-1 cells (5 × 104) with
serum-free medium were seeded into the upper chamber of
the system. Bottom wells in the system were filled with complete medium. After 24 h of incubation, the cells in the upper
chamber were removed, and the cells that invaded through
the Matrigel matrix membrane were stained with 4 μg/mL
Calcein AM in Hanks buffered saline at 37°C for 1 h. Then,
fluorescence of the invaded cells was read in ULTRA

Results
Pancreatic cancer cells showed downregulation of
miR-146a, and treatment of pancreatic cancer cells with
B-DIM and G2535 showed increased expression of miR146a. To investigate the difference in miRNA expression
between normal HPDE and pancreatic cancer cells, we conducted a miRNA array. The results from miRNA array were
validated by miRNA RT-PCR analysis. By miRNA array and
RT-PCR, we found that the expression level of miR-146a in
HPDE cells was higher than that in Colo357 and Panc-1 pancreatic cancer cells (Table 1; Fig. 1A), suggesting that pancreatic cancer cells had lower expression of miR-146a compared
with normal cells. Importantly, we also found that the miR146a expression was upregulated on 25 μmol/L B-DIM or
25 μmol/L G2535 treatments of Colo357 and Panc-1 cells
(Table 1; Fig. 1B and C). These results suggest that miR-146a
could be an inhibitory molecule for cancer development and
progression, and that B-DIM and G2535 could inhibit the progression of pancreatic cancer through induction of miR-146a
expression. Because miRNAs regulate expression of target
genes, we further tested the expression of miR-146a target
genes after reexpression or inhibition of miR-146a by transfection studies in pancreatic cancer cells.
Reexpression of miR-146a led to the inhibition of EGFR
signaling in pancreatic cancer cells. To investigate the role
of miR-146a in the regulation of cellular signaling, we transfected Colo357 and Panc-1 cells with miR-146a pre-microRNAs and cultured for a period of up to 9 d. We found
that the reexpression of miR-146a in the Colo357 and Panc1 cells resulted in the downregulation of EGFR both at the
mRNA and protein levels (Fig. 2A and B). Importantly, we
found that phosphorylated EGFR at Tyr992, which is responsible for the binding of the Src homology 2–containing phosphotyrosine phosphatase and positively affects receptor
tyrosine kinase signaling (21), was also downregulated after
miR-146a transfection (Fig. 2B). To confirm the effects of
miR-146a on EGFR, we transferred anti–miR-146 into pancreatic cancer cells and found that inhibition of miR-146 increased the levels of EGFR and p-EGFR (Fig. 2B). These
results suggest the inhibitory effects of miR-146a on EGFR
signaling. Because miR-146a could also regulate the expression of IRAK-1, which could activate NF-κB signaling, we in-

1490

Cancer Res; 70(4) February 15, 2010

vestigated the effects of miR-146a on IRAK-1/NF-κB signaling
pathways.
Reexpression of miR-146a led to the inhibition of IRAK1/NF-κB signaling and MTA-2 expression in pancreatic
cancer cells. After we transfected miR-146a into Colo357
and Panc-1 cells, we found that the reexpression of miR146a also caused downregulation of IRAK-1 expression in
the pancreatic cancer cells (Fig. 2C). Moreover, the level of
NF-κB was also decreased after miR-146a transfection (Fig.
2C), suggesting that miR-146a could regulate IRAK-1/NF-κB
signaling. Interestingly, we found that miR-146a inhibited the
expression of MTA-2 (Fig. 2D), which is one of the computerized predicted miR-146a target genes and associated with
cancer cell invasion and metastasis, suggesting that our findings are highly novel. These results were also confirmed by
the observations that the expression of IRAK-1, NF-κB, and
MTA-2 was upregulated by anti–miR-146 (Fig. 2C and D). Because we observed the upregulation of miR-146a after B-DIM
and G2535 treatment, we further investigated whether the
treatment of pancreatic cancer cells with B-DIM and G2535
could achieve similar effects as seen with reexpression of
miR-146a by transfection experiments.
B-DIM and G2535 treatment suppressed EGFR, IRAK-1/
NF-κB, and MTA-2 in pancreatic cancer cells. By RT-PCR
and Western blot analysis, we found that 25 μmol/L B-DIM
or 25 μmol/L G2535 inhibited the expression of EGFR at mRNA
and protein levels in Colo357 and Panc-1 cells (Fig. 3A and B).
Moreover, B-DIM and G2535 decreased the level of phosphorylated EGFR at the Tyr992 site in Colo357 and Panc-1 cells (Fig.
3B). Similar to the effects of miR-146a reexpression, B-DIM and
G2535 also decreased the expression of IRAK-1, NF-κB, and
MTA-2 in Colo357 and Panc-1 cells (Fig. 3C and D). These results suggest that the downregulation of EGFR, IRAK-1, NF-κB,
and MTA-2 by B-DIM and G2535 could be mediated through
the upregulation of miR-146a as seen earlier (Fig. 1B and C).
Because EGFR and IRAK-1 could alter the activity of NF-κB,
we further investigated the relationship between EGFR,
IRAK-1, NF-κB, and MTA-2 as presented below.
Cross-regulation between miR-146a, EGFR, IRAK-1,
IκBα, NF-κB, and MTA-2. As shown in Fig. 4A, the reexpression of miR-146a inhibited the expression of cytoplasmic
EGFR and decreased the level of cytoplasmic phosphorylated
IκBα and nuclear NF-κB, whereas the expression of cytoplasmic IκBα was increased after miR-146a transfection. To confirm whether these effects of miR-146a were mediated
through the downregulation of EGFR, we conducted EGFR
siRNA silencing experiments. We found that downregulation
of EGFR by EGFR siRNA also caused increased levels of cytoplasmic IκBα and decreased the levels of cytoplasmic
phosphorylated IκBα and nuclear NF-κB (Fig. 4A). Interestingly, we also found inhibition of MTA-2 expression by EGFR
siRNA (Fig. 4B). These results suggest that there are crossregulations between EGFR, IκBα, NF-κB, and MTA-2 signaling. More importantly, we found that B-DIM and G2535 also
increased the level of cytoplasmic IκBα and decreased the
level of cytoplasmic EGFR, phosphorylated IκBα, and nuclear
NF-κB (Fig. 4C). By EMSA, we observed that the NF-κB DNAbinding activity was inhibited by the reexpression of

Regulation of miR-146a by B-DIM and Isoflavone

miR-146a, and similar findings were also obtained by the
treatment of pancreatic cancer cells with B-DIM or G2535
(Fig. 4D), which is consistent with our data obtained from
Western blot analysis. These results suggest that the inhibition of NF-κB by B-DIM and G2535 could be partly mediated
through the upregulation of miR-146a and subsequent downregulation of EGFR. Because EGFR, NF-κB, and MTA-2 all are
associated with invasion and metastasis in cancer cells, we
tested the invasive capacity of Colo357 and Panc-1 cells after
reexpression or inhibition of miR-146a by transfection studies as well as after treatment of pancreatic cancer cells with
B-DIM and G2535.
miR-146a transfection or B-DIM and G2535 treatment
inhibited pancreatic cancer cell invasion. By invasion assay, we found that the invasive capacity of Colo357 and
Panc-1 cells was significantly inhibited by the reexpression
of miR-146a either by miR-146a transfection or by the treatment of pancreatic cancer cells with B-DIM or G2535 (Fig. 5A
and B). However, anti–miR-146 increased the invasion of
pancreatic cancer cells and restored invasive capacity of pancreatic cancer cells treated with B-DIM and G2535 (Fig. 5A
and B). We further treated pancreatic cancer cells with
erlotinib, one of the EGFR inhibitors, after miR-146a or anti–
miR-146 transfection and found that the level of miR-146 influenced the inhibitory effect of erlotinib, B-DIM, and G2535
on cell growth (Fig. 5C), suggesting the relationship between miR-146a and EGFR. These results clearly suggest
that B-DIM and G2535 could inhibit invasion and metastasis
of pancreatic cancer cells, which is in part due to the upregulation of miR-146a, and subsequent downregulation of EGFR,
NF-κB, and MTA-2 signaling.

Although recent years have witnessed the deregulated expression of miR-146, which has been implicated both in the
development of various cancers and in the negative regulation of inflammation induced through the innate immune response (22, 23), controversies exist regarding the effects of
miR-146a on cancer development and progression. The elevated miR-146a levels has been found in papillary thyroid
carcinoma (23) and cervical cancer (24), whereas reduced
miR-146a expression was associated with hormone-refractory
prostate cancer (12). In our study, we found lower levels of
miR-146a in pancreatic cancer cells compared with normal
HPDE cells, although we recognize that HPDE cells may
not be a perfect control for comparing miRNA expression
with pancreatic glandular cancer cells. Most importantly,
we found that the reexpression of miR-146a could reduce
the invasive capacity of both Colo357 and Panc-1 pancreatic
cancer cells, suggesting that the regulated expression of miR146a and its targeted genes could be exploited for designing
novel strategies for the treatment of pancreatic cancer in the
future. Our finding is consistent with recent reports showing
that upregulation of miR-146a inhibited cancer cell metastasis
in breast (13, 14, 25) and prostate (12) cancers. These results
collectively suggest that miR-146a could exert its critical
effects in the later stages of cancer rather than the initial

stage, and thus it is tempting to speculate that novel strategies by which one could induce higher levels of miR-146a in
cancer cells could be useful for suppressing tumor progression by inhibiting invasion and metastasis.
The molecular mechanism(s) involved in the miR-146a–
mediated inhibition of metastasis are still unclear. From our
results, we believe that miR-146a inhibits invasion and metastasis partly through the regulation of EGFR and NF-κB signal-

ing (Fig. 5D). From the Sanger database, it has been found
that EGFR and MTA-2 are predicted targets of miR-146a.
Hurst and colleagues recently reported that miR-146a and
miR-146b downregulated the expression of EGFR and inhibited breast cancer metastasis (14); however, how EGFR regulates cancer metastasis is unknown. In our study, we found
that the reexpression of miR-146a by transfection suppressed
the expression of EGFR and MTA-2 in pancreatic cancer cells.

Figure 4. miR-146a or EGFR siRNA
transfection increased the level of IκBα (A)
and decreased the levels of EGFR, p-IκBα,
NF-κB, and MTA-2 (B) in pancreatic cancer
cells. B-DIM (25 μmol/L) or isoflavone
(25 μmol/L) treatment increased the level of
IκBα and decreased the levels of EGFR,
p-IκBα, and NF-κB in pancreatic cancer
cells. EMSA (D) showed that NF-κB
DNA-binding activity in pancreatic cancer
cells was inhibited by the reexpression of
miR-146a or the treatment of cells with
25 μmol/L B-DIM or 25 μmol/L isoflavone.

Regulation of miR-146a by B-DIM and Isoflavone

Figure 5. Invasion assay showed that the reexpression of miR-146a by transfection studies or by the treatment of pancreatic cancer cells with 25 μmol/L
B-DIM or 25 μmol/L isoflavone significantly inhibited the invasion of pancreatic cancer cells through the Matrigel matrix membrane. However, inhibition
of miR-146 increased the invasion of pancreatic cancer cells and restored the invasive capacity of cells treated with B-DIM and G2535. A, Panc-1 cells;

Li et al.

Furthermore, downregulation of EGFR by siRNA could also
decrease MTA-2 expression, suggesting their cross-talks.
MTA (metastasis-associated gene or protein) is a newly discovered family of cancer gene that is associated with tumor
progression and metastasis (26). MTA-2 could deacetylate
and inactivate the tumor suppressor p53 protein (27). High expression of MTA-2 was associated with more aggressive behaviors of ovarian epithelial cancer (28). Therefore, miR-146a
could directly inhibit the expression of MTA-2 or indirectly
downregulate MTA-2 through the inhibition of EGFR, leading
to the suppression of cancer cell invasion and metastasis as
partly supported by our results (Fig. 5D). Moreover, it has been
reported that EGFR could regulate NF-κB signaling (29); thus,
miR-146a could indirectly downregulate NF-κB signaling by
suppressing EGFR, resulting in the inhibition of cancer cell invasion and metastasis. However, further in-depth mechanistic
studies are warranted based on our exciting results.
NF-κB is activated in a wide array of human cancers, and it
is thought to be involved in promoting invasion, angiogenesis, and metastasis in various cancers (30, 31). It has been
reported that NF-κB could be activated by IRAK-1 (32, 33),
which is a target of miR-146a (13). Therefore, miR-146a–
mediated inhibition of invasion could be through the downregulation of IRAK-1 and subsequent inactivation of NF-κB.
Indeed, we found that the expression of IRAK-1 was significantly inhibited by miR-146a transfection. We also observed
increased levels of cytoplasmic IκBα and decreased levels of
cytoplasmic phosphorylated IκBα and nuclear NF-κB after
reexpression of miR-146a or EGFR siRNA transfection, suggesting that miR-146a could regulate IκB/NF-κB signaling
through the inhibition of both IRAK-1 and EGFR (Fig. 5D).
Our results are also consistent with the findings reported
by other investigators showing that IRAK-1 could inhibit
IκBα, leading to the activation of NF-κB (32, 33), and that
EGFR or Her-2/neu are known activators of NF-κB through
the phosphorylation of IκBα mediated through Akt (34) and
the degradation of IκBα by calpain (35). Therefore, the inactivation of NF-κB could be another molecular mechanism by
which miR-146a inhibits cancer cell invasion and metastasis.
The inhibition of cancer cell invasion and metastasis should
be an important strategy for the successful treatment of pancreatic cancer, and thus any novel strategies by which the invasive and metastatic ability of pancreatic cancer cells could
be inhibited should be useful for improving the devastating
outcome of patients diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. We
and others previously reported that isoflavone and DIM (nontoxic natural agents) could inhibit invasion and metastasis of

prostate, breast, ovarian, and bladder cancer cells (36–41);
however, the molecular mechanism(s) involved has not been
fully elucidated. The data presented in this article showed, for
the first time, that the nontoxic natural agents such as B-DIM
and isoflavone could upregulate the expression of miR-146a,
which in turn downregulate the expression of EGFR, MTA-2,
IRAK-1, and NF-κB, resulting in the inhibition of invasion of
pancreatic cancer cells (Fig. 5D). These results clearly suggest
that instead of reexpression of miR-146a by transfection
studies, one could simply treat pancreatic cancer cells with
nontoxic natural agents that will result in the induction of
miR-146a expression. Thus, we believe that such a strategy
could be useful for the inactivation of multiple genes downstream of miR-146a toward pancreatic cancer therapy, especially because EGFR-targeted therapy (gefitinib, erlotinib, or
antibodies to EGFR) has essentially failed in clinical trials.
In conclusion, our results clearly show that B-DIM and isoflavone could upregulate miR-146a and inhibit cancer cell invasion, which was in part due to downregulation of EGFR
and NF-κB, the molecular targets that are commonly activated in pancreatic cancer. These results suggest that further
in vivo studies and clinical trials are needed to establish
whether these agents could also be useful in combination
with conventional chemotherapeutics or conventional
targeted agents for the treatment of pancreatic cancer for
which there is no effective and curative therapy.
