ABSTRACT
There is an urgent need to refine the prognostic taxonomy of HER2+ breast
carcinomas and develop easy-to-use, clinic-based prediction algorithms to distinguish
between good- and poor- responders to trastuzumab-based therapy. Building on
earlier studies suggesting that HER2+ tumors enriched with molecular and morphoimmunohistochemical features classically ascribed to basal-like tumors are highly
aggressive and refractory to trastuzumab, we investigated the prognostic and
predictive value of the basal-HER2+ phenotype in HER2-overexpressing tumors. Our
retrospective cohort study of a consecutive series of 152 HER2+ primary invasive
ductal breast carcinomas first confirmed the existence of a distinct subgroup
co-expressing HER2 protein and basal cytokeratin markers CK5/6, the so-called basalHER2+ phenotype. Basal-HER2+ phenotype (≥10% of cells showing positive CK5/6
staining), but not estrogen receptor status, was significantly associated with inferior
overall survival by univariate analysis and predicted worsened disease free survival
after accounting for strong prognostic variables such as tumor size at diagnosis in
stepwise multivariate analysis. In the sub-cohort of HER2+ patients treated with
trastuzumab-based adjuvant/neoadjuvant therapy, basal-HER2+ phenotype was
found to be the sole independent prognostic marker for a significantly inferior time
to treatment failure in multivariate analysis. A CK5/6-based immunohistochemical
fingerprint may provide a simple, rapid, and accurate method for re-classifying women
diagnosed with HER2+ breast cancer in a manner that can improve prognosis and
therapeutic planning in patients with clinically aggressive basal-HER2+ tumors who
are not likely to benefit from trastuzumab-based therapy.

In women with early-stage breast cancer, adjuvant use
of the anti-HER2 monoclonal antibody trastuzumab reduces
recurrence risk when added to standard chemotherapy [1,
2]. However, not all cases of HER2+ breast tumors derive
similar benefit from trastuzumab because a significant
number of patients develop disease recurrence. At
present, clinicians rely on established markers of HER2
expression for selecting patients for adjuvant trastuzumab
or neoadjuvant pertuzumab-trastuzumab therapy i.e.,
immunohistochemical express­ion at the 3+ level or FISH
ratio of 2 or greater [3]. Biomarkers to identify those
patients who are not likely to benefit from trastuzumab
would be clinically useful, allowing patients to pursue
other therapeutic options. A predictive biomarker to
classify a subgroup of patients with HER2+ tumors that
are particularly resistant to trastuzumab could be especially
important in the adjuvant setting, where the effectiveness of
a given therapy in an individual patient cannot be assessed.
Unfortunately, the identification of a robust clinical or
molecular predictor of adjuvant trastuzumab benefit,
including HER2 itself, has proven challenging [4–8].
Earlier work by Harris et al. [9], demonstrated that
a particular HER2+ tumor phenotype overexpressing
genes associated with the basal-like phenotype, including
higher expression of basal cytokeratins (CKs), was more
frequent in the non-responding group of patients receiving
pre-operative trastuzumab than in the responding group.
Building on these pioneering findings and considering
that trastuzumab sensitivity is notably restricted to
luminal-HER2+ breast cancer cell lines, whereas all basalHER2+ cell lines exhibit inherent primary resistance to
trastuzumab [10], we recently proposed that a basal CK
surrogate definition of HER2+ breast carcinomas might
define subgroups of patients likely to display resistance
to trastuzumab-based therapy. Although published data on
HER2+ and basal phenotype are limited, the longstanding
assumption that HER2+ and basal-like breast cancers
are mutually exclusive entities is open to dispute. While
the first molecular portraits of breast tumors using DNA
microarrays suggested that breast carcinomas with a basal
phenotype are HER2 non-amplified [11], subsequent
refined analyses tended to include HER2-amplified
tumors branching close or included in a bona fide basallike subclass [12–15]. Beyond microarray-based gene
profiling studies, the so-called basal-HER2+ subtype has
been also identified by immunohistochemical biomarker
profiles. When Laakso et al. segregated basal-like breast
cancers based on immunohistochemical expression of
basal CKs, those tumors with low basal CK expression
were likely to have HER2 overexpression [16]. Similarly,
Liu et al. described a small group of hormone receptornegative tumors simultaneously expressing HER2 and
basal markers [17]. Both studies found that patients
with the basal-HER2+ subtype had a significantly worse
prognosis than those with basal-like and HER2+ tumors.
Bhargava et al. [18] and our own group [19] observed that
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

many morphological and immunohistochemical features
classically ascribed to basal-like tumors, including
large geographic necrosis and lymphoid infiltrate,
are commonly seen in basal-HER2+ tumors. Bagaria
et al. [20] have recently confirmed that when luminalHER2+ (ER-positive and basal CK-negative), HER2+
(ER-negative and basal CK-negative) and basal-HER2+
(ER-negative and basal CK-positive) were correlated
with clinicopathological features and overall survival,
the basal-HER2+ subtype was associated with the worst
prognosis.
Collectively, the results from these studies strongly
support the notion that the basal-HER2+ phenotype may
delineate a distinct entity of biologically-aggressive
breast carcinomas; however, whether the basal-HER2+
phenotype also has clinical utility as a predictive
marker of resistance to trastuzumab-based therapy
remains to be clarified. Beyond confirming that the
basal-HER2+ phenotype can predict worse diseasefree and overall survival, we have also evaluated
whether immunohistochemical-based identification of
the basal-HER2+ phenotype can predict resistance to
trastuzumab-based adjuvant therapy, which may have
crucial implications for patients originally identified as
suitable for trastuzumab based solely on their HER2+
phenotype. We show here that a simple CK5/6-based
fingerprint using a 10% positivity cutoff, allows the
re-classification of HER2+ tumors in a manner that
improves prognosis and therapeutic planning in a subclass of patients with clinically aggressive basal-HER2+
tumors that are not likely to benefit from trastuzumabbased therapy.

RESULTS
Clinicopathological features
Breast cancer tissue sections of 154 consecutive
patients with HER2-overexpressing primary invasive ductal
breast cancer were evaluated for expression of ER and
CK5/6 by IHC: 89 (58%) tumors were luminal-HER2+,
39 (26%) tumors were HER2+, and 24 (16%) tumors were
basal-HER+ (Table 1). Representative examples of HER2+
breast carcinomas expressing basal epithelial CK markers
(CK5/6) are shown in Figure 1.
Patients with basal-HER2+ tumors were more
likely to have larger tumors (P = 0.011) and recurrence
(P = 0.007) than those with luminal-HER2+ and HER2+
tumors. There were no differences in age at diagnosis,
tumor size, nodal status, and tumor grade between patients
with luminal-HER2+ and HER2+ tumors. There were
no differences in the use of adjuvant trastuzumab and
chemotherapy across the three HER2+ groups. Patients
with luminal-HER2+ tumors were more likely to receive
hormone therapy than patients with HER2+ and basalHER2+ tumors (P < 0.001) (Table 1).

Overall survival (OS)

95% confidence interval 1.88–8.79; P < 0.001). Neither ER
nor nodal statuses were statistically significant prognostic
factors of 5-year OS. When variables correlating with
univariate survival at p < 0.20 were later included in
multivariate Cox regression analysis (Table 3), the basallike phenotype lost its independent value for predicting
OS. In multivariate analysis, only age at diagnosis and
tumor size remained independent predictors of OS.

The 5-year Kaplan-Meier estimate of OS was 69%
for patients with basal-HER2+ tumors, as compared
with 82% for patients with luminal-HER2+ and 78%
for HER2 + tumors (Figure 2). No statistical differences
were found in 5-year estimated OS between patients with
luminal-HER2+ tumors and those with HER2+ tumors.
Upon stratification of basal-HER2+ to underlying CK5/6
expression, the 5-year Kaplan-Meier estimate of OS was
54% for patients with basal 2-HER2+ tumors (Figure 2),
whereas the estimate of OS in patients with basal 1-HER2+
tumors (82%) was not statistically different to CK-negative
(luminal-HER2+ and HER2+) HER2+ patients.
We utilized Cox’s proportional-hazards regression
model to assess OS (Table 3). Univariate analysis revealed
that the presence of the basal-like phenotype was a
significant predictor of a worse 5-year OS (hazard ratio
2.36, 95% confidence interval 1.18–4.75; P = 0.0159).
Upon stratification of basal CK5/6 expression pattern,
univariate analysis revealed that a positive CK5/6 staining
in ≥ 10% of the HER2+ breast cancer tissue sections (but
not a positive CK5/6 < 10%) predicted a significantly
worse prognosis in terms of 5-year OS (hazard ratio 4.07,
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Disease-free survival (DFS)
The 5-year Kaplan-Meier estimate of DFS was 52%
for patients with basal-HER2+ tumors, as compared with
77% for patients with luminal-HER2+, and 68% for HER2
+ tumors (Figure 3). No statistical differences were found
in 5-year estimated DFS between patients with luminalHER2+ tumors and patients with HER2+. Notably,
upon stratification of basal-HER2+ to underlying CK5/6
expression pattern, the 5-year Kaplan-Meier estimate of
DFS was as low as 27% for patients with basal 2-HER2+
tumors (Figure 3), whereas the estimate of DFS in patients
with basal 1-HER2+ tumors (75%) was not statistically
different to those with basal CK-negative (luminal-HER2+
and HER2+) HER2+ patients.

*1 proportional hazard assumption for the Cox model has been checked
We utilized Cox’s proportional-hazards regression
model to assess DFS (Table 4). Univariate analysis
revealed that the presence of the basal-like phenotype
was a significant predictor of a worse 5-year DFS (hazard
ratio 2.05, 95% confidence interval 1.04–4.04; P = 0.037).
Upon stratification of basal CK5/6 expression pattern,
univariate analysis revealed that a positive CK5/6 staining
in ≥ 10% of the HER2+ breast cancer tissue sections (but
not a positive CK5/6 < 10%) predicted a significantly
worse 5-year DFS (hazard ratio 4.17, 95% confidence
interval 1.96–8.98; P < 0.001). Neither ER nor nodal
statuses were statistically significant prognostic factors
of 5-year DFS. Importantly, when variables correlating
with univariate survival at p < 0.20 were later included
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

in multivariate Cox regression analysis (Table 4), the
presence of the basal 2-HER2+ phenotype (i.e., a positive
CK5/6 staining in more than 10% of the HER2+ breast
cancer tissue sections) retained its independent value for
predicting a worse outcome in terms of DFS (hazard ratio
2.44, 95% confidence interval 1.05–5.67; P = 0.037).
In multivariate analysis, tumor size also remained an
independent predictor of a worse DFS.

2.07–14.35; P < 0.001). Remarkably, after accounting for
prognostic variables correlating with univariate survival at
p < 0.20 (Table 5), tumor size and the presence of the basal
2-HER2+ phenotype (i.e., a positive CK5/6 staining in ≥
10% of the HER2+ breast cancer tissue sections) retained
their independent value for predicting a worse prognosis in

We finally assessed the prognostic significance

might constitute a predictor of a worse course in terms
of time to treatment failure (TTF) (Table 5). Univariate
analysis revealed that tumor size, node status and the
presence of a basal-like phenotype predicted a significantly
worsened TTF (Figure 4). Upon stratification of basal
CK5/6 expression pattern, univariate analysis revealed
that a positive CK5/6 staining in ≥ 10% of the HER2+
breast cancer tissue sections (but not a positive CK5/6
< 10%) was a significant predictor of worse outcome in

*1 proportional hazard assumption for the Cox model has been checked
stratification of basal CK5/6 expression pattern, univariate
analysis confirmed that a positive CK5/6 staining in ≥
10% of the HER2+ breast cancer tissue sections (but not
a positive CK5/6 < 10%) was a significant predictor of
worse outcome in terms of TTF in trastuzumab-treated
patients (hazard ratio 7.49, 95% confidence interval 1.41–
39.70; P = 0.018). More importantly, a positive CK5/6
staining in ≥ 10% of the HER2+ breast cancer tissue
sections remained the sole independent factor predicting
a worse outcome of trastuzumab-treated patients in terms
of TTF in multivariate Cox regression analysis (hazard
ratio 6.80, 95% confidence interval 1.39–33.36). KaplanMeier estimates of TTF confirmed that patients with basal
2-HER2+ tumors did not benefit from adding trastuzumab
to chemotherapy (Figure 5).

This complexity makes the establishment of optimal
cutoffs nearly impossible and the validation of the
eight-gene classifier, if applied arbitrarily, could
lead to misclassification of HER2+ patients and thus
inappropriate treatment recommendations [22]. Using
molecular profiling to investigate the variable prognosis
and response to therapy of HER2+ tumors, Staaf et al.
[23] identified a 158-gene HER2-derived prognostic
predictor (HDPP) that improved the stratification of good
and poor prognosis for both OS and distant metastasis-free
survival in both the HER2-enriched molecular subtype
and the basal-like subtype, which are assumed to be
mutually exclusive breast cancer entities. When applied
to a small HER2+ group of patients preoperatively treated
with trastuzumab, the HDPP signature correlated with
the occurrence of trastuzumab resistance. Although the
sample size was insufficient to form any conclusion, it
should be noted that when formerly analyzing this data
set, Harris et al. [9] posited that “HER2-overexpressing
tumors with a basal-like phenotype” were more likely to
be intrinsically resistant to pre-operative trastuzumab.
Here, we present evidence that immunohistochemical
reclassification of HER2+ breast cancer tumors by basal
CK5/6 expression might be sufficient to significantly
improve prognosis and trastuzumab-based therapeutic
planning.

DISCUSSION
Currently available gene expression signatures
cannot identify HER2+ subgroups of good- and poorresponders to trastuzumab. In an ambitious attempt to
address the need for a predictor of trastuzumab benefit,
Pogue-Geile et al. [8] developed an eight-gene model able
to stratify HER2+ tumors into a discontinuous distribution
of patients within 3 different subsets of “extraordinary”,
“moderate”, and “no apparent” benefit from trastuzumab.

Figure 5: Kaplan-Meier TTF curves of HER2+ patients treated with trastuzumab-based therapy when stratified by
ER status, HER2 phenotype, and CK5/6 phenotype.
Previous morpho-immunohistologic studies [15–19]
have shown that a subgroup of HER2+ tumors consistently
demonstrate several features classically ascribed to
basal-like tumors, including poor differentiation, highgrade, geographic necrosis, pushing margins of invasion,
syncytial arrangement of tumor cells, ribbon- or festoonlike, squamous metaplasia, stromal lymphocytic infiltrates,
high mitotic index, and p53 positivity. Importantly, these
basal-HER2+ breast carcinomas show immunoreactivity
for the basal epithelium cytokeratin marker CK5/6, which
at times appears as a uniform or almost uniform positive
staining that fully mimics the pattern of pure basal-like
breast carcinomas, but often displays checkerboard-type
intratumoral heterogeneity. Here we confirm that the basalHER2+ phenotype defined by the immunohistochemical
expression of basal CK5/6 is associated with aggressive
disease and adversely impacts survival in HER2+ breast
cancer patients. In our series, there were no statistically
significant differences in OS and DFS between patients
with ER-positive luminal-HER2+ tumors and ER-negative
HER2+ tumors. However, the basal-HER2+ phenotype
was significantly associated with inferior OS by univariate
analysis and, after accounting for strong prognostic
variables such as tumor size at diagnosis in stepwise
multivariate analysis, the presence of the basal-HER2+
phenotype, but not ER status, also predicted significantly
worsened DFS when a positive CK5/6 staining in ≥ 10%
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

of the HER2+ breast cancer tissue sections was registered
as a diagnostically relevant positive reaction.
Our findings might not only have important
implications for prognosis, but also for therapy. The simple
and specific CK5/6 fingerprint using a 10% cutoff allows
the re-classification of HER2+ tumors into a sub-class of
basal 1-HER2+ tumors (<10% of cells showing positive
CK5/6 staining), which appear to be prognostically
indistinguishable from HER2+ tumors, and a sub-class
of clinically aggressive basal 2-HER2+ tumors (≥10%
of cells showing positive CK5/6 staining) which will
likely be unresponsive to trastuzumab-based adjuvant/
neoadjuvant therapy. While acknowledging that our
study is small and exploratory and the data on adjuvant/
neoadjuvant trastuzumab are limited in size (approximately
45% of HER2+ patients) and maturity (median follow-up
is approximately 4 years for patients treated with adjuvant
trastuzumab), the fact that the use of adjuvant/neoadjuvant
trastuzumab and chemotherapy did not greatly differ
between patients with HER2+ and basal 2-HER2+ tumors
together with the strong association between the basal
2-HER2+ phenotype and worsened survival and shorter
time to trastuzumab-based treatment failure, strongly
suggest that immunohistochemical identification of the basal
2-HER2+ phenotype may be used as a predictive marker
of primary refractoriness to trastuzumab. Accordingly, the
co-expression of well-known basal-like molecular features,

including expression of the anti-apoptotic protein survivin,
the dynamic emergence of the CD44+CD24-/low breast cancer
stem cell (CSC) immunophenotype, or the occurrence of
epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) phenomena,
occurs exclusively in HER2+ breast cancer cells exhibiting
primary resistance to trastuzumab [10, 19, 24–30].
The a priori characterization of distinct biological
HER2+ breast cancer subgroups associated with poorer
prognosis and resistance to trastuzumab-based adjuvant/
neoadjuvant therapy using DNA microarrays is not
currently feasible for large-scale clinical applications.
In this setting, immunohistochemical staining of basal
CK5/6 can be a useful surrogate to predict inferior
survival and poorer responses to trastuzumab-based
therapy. In our hands, a CK5/6-based fingerprint using
a 10% positivity cutoff allows the rapid re-classification
of HER2+ tumors in a manner that improves prognosis
and therapeutic planning in a sub-class of patients with
clinically aggressive basal-HER2+ tumors who are
unlikely to benefit from trastuzumab-based adjuvant
therapy (Figure 6). It is tempting to suggest that
CK5/6-defined basal-HER2+ tumors might be viewed as
an immunohistochemical algorithm, analogous to EMT
and CSC-like gene signatures and likely contributes to
the poor outcomes in basal-HER2+ tumors [31–36].
Although larger retrospective studies should be conducted
to unequivocally determine whether basal-HER2+ tumors
are differentially enriched with cells combining EMT/CSC
phenotypes, it is noteworthy that the sole re-classification
of ER-/HER2+ tumors by the expression of the core EMT
transcription factors SNAI2 (SLUG) and TWIST [37]
using the on-line Kaplan-Meier plotter (http://kmplot.
com/) [38, 39], was sufficient to predict a significantly
inferior relapse free survival (RFS) and distant metastasis
free survival (DMFS) in the EMT-like/HER2+ patient
cohort (Figure 7).
There is an urgent need to generate a more
definitive taxonomy of HER2+ breast carcinomas as
well as molecular forecasting signatures to be validated
prospectively and in samples from trastuzumab-based
clinical trials. Our current findings lend support to
forthcoming prospective studies aimed to validate
the concept that identification of CK5/6-positive
immunophenotypes within HER2+ breast carcinomas may
be a rapid and accurate method for identifying intrinsic
subgroups of biologically aggressive tumors likely to
display resistance to trastuzumab ab initio in women
diagnosed with HER2+ cancer.

with HER2-overexpressing primary breast cancer between
June 2000 and February 2014. The study was limited to
the most common breast cancer histology, i.e., invasive
ductal cancer, to allow for more accurate prognostication.
The investigators irreversibly anonymized (stripped of
any link to the original patient) all the tissues and existing
data in such a manner that subjects cannot be identified,
directly or through identifiers linked to the subjects.

Immunohistochemistry (IHC) and classification
Primary tumor size according to pathological
analysis was classified according to the Seventh Edition
of the AJCC Cancer Staging Manual. A board-certified
specialty-trained breast pathologist (E. L. B.) reviewed
immunohistochemical (ER, HER2) stainings from 154
consecutive patients with HER2-overexpressing primary
invasive ductal breast cancer. Approximately 30% of
the study cohort was previously checked for receptor
expression, which was undertaken as an internal quality
control measure to confirm that the ER and HER2 status
of patients at the time of performance of this study was
in agreement with that initially rendered at the time of
diagnosis. No noticeable differences were encountered
when ER and HER2 IHC staining was scored using
criteria from published guidelines. The cutoff for ER
immunoreactivity was 10% positive tumor nuclei
irrespective of intensity. HER2 expression status was
considered positive if immunostaining was scored as 3+
(i.e., strongly positive in > 10% of cancer cells by IHC)
according to HercepTest criteria. For an equivocal result of
HER2 2+ (i.e., moderately positive in > 10% of cancer cells
by IHC), HER2 expression status was considered positive
if fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) assay revealed a
HER2:chromosome-17 amplification ratio of > 2.2.
Paraffin-embedded tissue sections from HER2+
tumors were immunostained with CK5/6 (clone D5/16B4,
Dako; 1:50 dilution) antibody. Antigen retrieval was
performed using Tris-EDTA pH 9 for 30 minutes. Analysis
was carried out by a board-certified pathologist (E. L.
B.), who scored the basal CK5/6 staining on a scale of
0–2: 0, no staining; 1, < 10% of cells showing positive
staining; and 2, ≥ 10% of cells showing positive. A
CK5/6 score greater than 0 originally defined a positive
basal phenotype. Tumors were then classified as luminal/
HER2+ subtype (ER positive and basal CK5/6 negative),
HER2+ subtype (ER negative and basal CK5/6 negative),
and basal-HER2+ subtype (ER negative and basal CK5/6
positive) (Figure 1).
The current study is reported according to the
Reporting Recommendations for Tumor Marker
Prognostic Studies (REMARK). Laboratory personnel
who were blinded to clinical data and outcomes performed
all IHC assays. Assay results were interpreted and scored
by a pathologist (E. L. B.) who remained blinded to
clinical data.

equality of the survival functions. Cox’s proportionalhazards regression model was used to identify statistically
significant predictors of OS, DFS, and TTF and the
proportional hazard assumption was validated. In such
models, the covariate function is proportional to the
hazard or mortality and, therefore, positive coefficients
indicate a shorter survival with increasing value of the
covariate. P values of less than 0.05 were considered to be
statistically significant.

All statistical data analyses were performed using
IBM SPSS version 21.0 (IBM Corp. 2012) and R software
environment (http://www.r-project.org/). Data collected
included date of birth, date of diagnosis, tumor size, tumor
grade, lymph node status, receipt of adjuvant therapy
(hormone, trastuzumab, and chemotherapy), site and
date of recurrent disease, and date of death. Proportions
observed among categorical variables were compared
using the chi-squared test or Fisher’s exact test. The
Mann-Whitney U test was used to test for differences in
continuous variables. Survival functions were estimated
for disease-free survival and overall survival using the
product-limit method of Kaplan and Meier. Overall
survival (OS) was calculated from the date of diagnosis
to the date of death. Disease-free survival (DFS) was
calculated from the date of initial diagnosis to the date
of recurrence or death, whichever came first. Patients
not experiencing an event were considered censored at
the date of last contact. Time to treatment failure (TTF)
was calculated from the date of therapy initiation to the
time of first evidence of failure, i.e., disease progression,
recurrence or death. Inference on survival functions
among subgroups was based on the log-rank test for the
