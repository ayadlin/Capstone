Abstract
Since cancer cells depend on glucose more than normal cells, we compared the effects of low carbohydrate
(CHO) diets to a Western diet on the growth rate of tumors in mice. To avoid caloric restriction–induced effects,
we designed the low CHO diets isocaloric with the Western diet by increasing protein rather than fat levels
because of the reported tumor-promoting effects of high fat and the immune-stimulating effects of high protein.
We found that both murine and human carcinomas grew slower in mice on diets containing low amylose CHO
and high protein compared with a Western diet characterized by relatively high CHO and low protein. There was
no weight difference between the tumor-bearing mice on the low CHO or Western diets.
Additionally, the low CHO-fed mice exhibited lower blood glucose, insulin, and lactate levels. Additive
antitumor effects with the low CHO diets were observed with the mTOR inhibitor CCI-779 and especially with
the COX-2 inhibitor Celebrex, a potent anti-inflammatory drug. Strikingly, in a genetically engineered mouse
model of HER-2/neu–induced mammary cancer, tumor penetrance in mice on a Western diet was nearly 50% by
the age of 1 year whereas no tumors were detected in mice on the low CHO diet. This difference was associated
with weight gains in mice on the Western diet not observed in mice on the low CHO diet. Moreover, whereas only
1 mouse on the Western diet achieved a normal life span, due to cancer-associated deaths, more than 50% of the
mice on the low CHO diet reached or exceeded the normal life span. Taken together, our findings offer a
compelling preclinical illustration of the ability of a low CHO diet in not only restricting weight gain but also
cancer development and progression. Cancer Res; 71(13); 4484–93. 2011 AACR.

Introduction
More than 80 years ago, Otto Warburg found that most
cancer cells, unlike normal cells, rely more on glycolysis than
oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) to meet their energy
needs, even under normoxic conditions (1). He postulated that
this "aerobic glycolysis" was due to irreversible defects in
mitochondrial respiration (2). However, whereas some studies
have linked mitochondrial mutations to cancer (3), a causal

role for these mutations seems to be relatively rare (4), and, in
most cases, glycolysis in tumors seems reversible (5). Importantly, because glycolysis is far less efficient at generating ATP,
most cancer cells require higher levels of glucose than normal
cells to proliferate and survive, and this is why the glucose
analog, 18fluorodeoxyglucose, is capable of detecting the
majority of human tumors via positron emission tomography
(PET; ref. 6).
The current consensus to explain why tumor cells prefer
aerobic glycolysis is that even though it is far less efficient than
OXPHOS at generating ATP, yielding only 2 ATPs/glucose
rather than 34 ATPs/glucose, it does not catabolize glucose
completely to CO2 for ATP but instead uses the carbon chains
as building blocks for nucleic acid (i.e., ribose), protein (i.e.,
alanine, etc.), and lipid (i.e., citrate) syntheses, all of which are
essential for cell proliferation (7). This likely explains why
increased glycolysis is not exclusive to solid tumors, but also
occurs in leukemias (8) and some rapidly growing normal
cells, such as clonally expanding T cells (9). Also, glycolysis, via
its pentose phosphate pathway offshoot, provides NADPH,
which generates glutathione, an important intracellular reducing agent that prevents intracellular reactive oxygen species–
induced death in cancer cells (10). In addition, glycolysis leads
to the secretion of lactic acid, which can decrease the extracellular pH from 7.4 to 6.0 within a poorly perfused tumor, and

Low Carbohydrate, High Protein Diets Slow Tumor Growth

this promotes metastasis by inducing normal cell death,
angiogenesis, extracellular matrix degradation, and the inhibition of tumor antigen-specific immune responses (11). So, as
long as cancer cells can obtain high levels of glucose, a high
glycolytic rate provides sufficient ATP, even under hypoxic
conditions, for tumor cell survival and proliferation (12).
Thus, we investigated whether low carbohydrate (CHO),
high protein diets could sufficiently decrease blood glucose
(BG) in mice to slow tumor growth. To prevent caloric
restriction (CR)-induced effects, we had isocaloric diets prepared, in which we compensated for the low CHO content by
raising protein levels. We chose high protein rather than high
fat because of the reported tumor-promoting effects of high
fat (13, 14) and the established benefits of amino acid supplementation (15, 16).

Materials and Methods
Mice and tumor cell injections
Five- to 8-week-old C3H/HeN and Rag2M mice, from
Simonsen Laboratories or bred in-house, were housed 2 to
4 mice/cage in high-top Allentown cages on static racks, with
2 times per week bedding changes. Unless otherwise stated, 2
 105 murine squamous cell carcinoma VII (SCCVII) cells
(from James W. Evans, Threshold Pharmaceuticals, South San
Francisco, CA in 2005), cultured in vitro in RPMI þ 10% fetal
calf serum þ 50 U/mL penicillin and 50 mg/mL streptomycin,
were injected subcutaneously (s.c.) into the backs of shaved
C3H/HeN mice. Similarly, 8  106 human colorectal carcinoma (HCT-116) cells (from ATCC in 2002 and not passaged
for more than 6 months before use) were injected into Rag2M
mice. Tumors were measured 2 to 3 times per week by using
manual calipers, and their volumes were determined by the
formula—(Length  Width  Height)  p/6—except for the
Rag2M study, where the following formula was used—(Length
 Width  Width)/2.
Female NOP mice, which express a HER2/Neu-Ovalbumin
fusion protein under the mouse mammary tumor virus
(MMTV) promoter and expressing the Trp53 minigene (17),
were put on Western (5058) or 15% CHO diets at 8 weeks of
age and monitored for tumor development. They were sacrificed when tumors were palpable (with subsequent confirmation by necropsy) or when age-associated idiopathic
dermatitis developed.
Measurement of blood glucose, insulin, and lactate
BG was measured via tail vein by using a OneTouch Ultraglucose meter and LifeScan test strips. Insulin and lactate
levels were determined by ELISA (Mercodia; #10-1247-01) and
lactate assay kits (BioVision; #K607-100), respectively, using
plasma from CO2-euthanized mice.
Reagents
All diets (Table 1) were from TestDiet. Unless otherwise
stated, diets were switched 7 days before tumor implantation.
Celebrex (Pfizer) was formulated into the diets by TestDiet.
CCI-779 (LC Labs) was diluted from a 100% ethanol stock into
the vehicle (5% Tween-80 þ 5% PEG400 in PBS) used for

intraperitoneal injections into mice at 1.5 mg/kg on days 4 and
7 after tumor implantation. All other reagents were from
Sigma Chemical Co., unless otherwise stated.
Statistical analyses
GraphPad Prism (GraphPad Software, Inc.) was used for
statistical analyses. Briefly, tumor sizes and ELISA results were
tested for statistical significant differences by using a 1-tailed t
test, and regressions were tested by using the Spearman rank
correlation and F tests. A log-rank (Mantel–Cox) test was used
to determine the significance of the difference between the
survival curves in the spontaneous tumor study. Numbers
were considered statistically significant if P value was 0.05 or
less, unless otherwise stated.

Results
Tumors grow slower in mice on an 8% CHO, 69%
protein, 23% fat (8% CHO) diet, but the mice lose weight
As it is well established that most human and murine tumors
take up more glucose than normal tissues (6), we asked if we
could decrease BG levels sufficiently, by decreasing dietary
CHO, to significantly reduce tumor growth rates. We considered this possible because no-CHO ketogenic diets (NCKD)
have recently been shown to reduce tumor growth rates in mice
and rats (18). However, as it would be extremely difficult for
humans to maintain such a NCKD, we asked if a more
moderate, CHO-reduced diet could decrease BG levels and
reduce tumor growth rates. To test this, we first designed a
mouse diet containing 8% CHO (% of total calories consumed),
because this level is used in the Atkins diet (19). However, we
kept fat levels in the range of a Western diet (23%) rather than
the 50% used in the Atkins diet because of the tumor-promoting effects of high fat (13, 14), and raised the level of protein
instead (Table 1). Comparing the effect of this diet, given ad
libitum, with an isocaloric Western diet (TestDiet 5058; Table 1)
on BG levels in nontumor bearing Rag2M mice revealed that
BG, indeed, dropped significantly after 4 to 7 days on the 8%
CHO diet to a new, stable plateau (Fig. 1A), in keeping with
previous reports showing that BG drops within 7 days on a
ketogenic diet (20). Interestingly, this drop was more pronounced in male mice, consistent with the reported BG buffering effects of estrogen (21). On the basis of these results, we
carried out the majority of our studies with male mice.

In our first tumor studies, we acclimatized 5- to 6-week-old

week, then injected s.c. SCCVII cells and monitored tumor
growth. As shown in Figure 1B, tumors in the mice on the 8%

4486

CHO diet grew significantly slower, with the mean tumor size
of the 8% CHO group (130.9  21.76 mm3) being less than half
that of the 5058 group (364.3  85.01 mm3) at 16 days after
tumor implantation. Also, BG levels in the 8% group were
significantly lower (Fig. 1C). Similar results were obtained in
Rag2M mice injected with human colorectal cancer cells
(HCT-116 cells; data not shown).
Although mice on 8% CHO diet had slower growing tumors,
they lost weight, weighing, on average, 20% less than mice on
5058 diet (Fig. 1D). This was consistent with the mice eating
less than the 5058 group (data not shown), likely because the
8% CHO pellets were significantly harder to chew. This confounded our results because CR, which is known to cause cells
to switch, via AMPK activation, to OXPHOS to generate more
ATP for survival (22), has been shown to slow tumor growth
(23). Thus, we could not rule out the possibility that the slower
tumor growth rates were due to the effects of CR rather than
to reduced dietary CHO.
A 15% high amylose CHO, 58% protein, 26% fat (15%
CHO) diet reduces both fasting and constitutive BG
To prevent CR, we formulated a new diet consisting of
15.6% CHO, 58.2% protein, and 26.2% fat. Instead of sucrose,
which was in our 8% CHO diet, this diet contained cornstarch
with 70% amylose because it allowed for a pellet consistency
similar to 5058, and because amylose is digested more slowly
than sucrose or amylopectin (in 5058), which results in less
pronounced postprandial BG and insulin spikes (24). We
found that mice ate this chow at the same rate as 5058,
and that, after a short fasting period, it did not increase BG
to the same extent as 5058, two hours after feeding (Fig. 2A).
Moreover, mice on this 15% CHO diet had lower constitutive
BG levels than mice on the 5058 diet (Fig. 2B).
Tumors grow slower in mice on the 15% CHO diet
without weight loss
We then compared SCCVII tumor growth in C3H/HeN mice
on the 15% CHO versus 5058 diets and found that tumors grew
significantly slower in the 15% CHO group, with an average
volume of 321.0  79.79 mm3 versus 542.9  78.80 mm3 in the
5058 group, 16 days after implantation (Fig. 2C). Significantly,
there was no difference in caloric intake (data not shown),
average body weight (Fig. 2D, left), or rate of weight gain
(Fig. 2D, right) between these diet groups.
We also compared the effect of this 15% CHO diet with 5058
on the growth of HCT-116 tumors in Rag2M mice and found
that 15% CHO mice had significantly smaller tumors, with a
mean size of 255.6  10.50 mm3 versus 401.7  35.21 mm3 in
the 5058 group, 21 days after tumor implantation (Fig. 2E).
Once again, there was no difference in the average body weight
or rate of weight gain between the 2 groups (Fig. 2F).
A 10% CHO diet slows tumor growth more than a 15%
CHO diet without significant weight loss
To see if we could further reduce tumor growth rates by
decreasing dietary CHO levels even more, we tested another
isocaloric diet containing 10% high amylose CHO, 64% protein,
and 26% fat (Table 1). Comparing tumor growth in male C3H/

HeN mice, we found that tumors in mice fed this 10% CHO diet
were significantly smaller (572.3  215.7 mm3) than those on
5058 (1153.0  108.0 mm3), 22 days postimplantation
(Fig. 3A). This difference was more pronounced than with
the 15% CHO diet and on par with the 8% CHO diet. As
expected, the BG of mice on the 10% CHO was lower than
those on 5058 (Fig. 3B). Even though the mice on the 10% CHO
diet gained weight throughout the study and ate the same
amount of food (data not shown), their average body weight at
the end was slightly (7%) lower (Fig. 3C), raising the concern
that the smaller tumors in the 10% CHO group might be
because of a smaller body size. To investigate this, we carried
out a meta-analysis of pooled data from 3 independent
experiments and found no significant positive correlation
between body weight and tumor size for either the 5058
(Fig. 3F, left) or 10% CHO groups (Fig. 3F, right). This indicated
that, within the range of mouse weights tested, smaller body
sizes were not related to smaller tumors. Nonetheless, we
cannot say with absolute certainty that the slightly lower

weights of the 10% CHO-fed mice had no impact on tumor
size.
Low CHO diets cause a drop in plasma insulin and
lactate
To gain some insight into how the low CHO diets were
reducing tumor growth rates, we measured plasma insulin
levels and found that all the low CHO diets reduced plasma
insulin, with the 8% and 10% CHO having a more marked
effect than the 15% CHO diet (Fig. 4A). As high BG triggers
insulin release from pancreatic b-cells, and the released
insulin then enhances cellular uptake of BG via insulin receptor-mediated upregulation and activation of glucose transporters (25), these insulin results suggest that low CHO diets
can reduce insulin-mediated glucose uptake into tumor cells.
Consistent with this and our hypothesis that glucose supply is
related to tumor growth, we found a positive correlation
between plasma insulin levels and tumor size (Fig. 4B). We
also compared plasma lactate levels in 5058 versus 10% CHO

mice and found the 5058-fed mice had significantly higher
lactate levels (0.713  0.03 mmol/L versus 0.572  0.03 mmol/
L; Fig. 4C), consistent with reduced glycolysis in the low CHOfed mice. Once again, we found a positive correlation between
plasma lactate levels and tumor size (Fig. 4D).
Low CHO diets act additively with known cancer
therapeutic agents to reduce tumor growth
Having shown that the 10% and 15% CHO diets slowed
tumor growth without significant weight loss, we asked if they
might be additive with known cancer therapeutic agents. To
test this, we first compared the growth of SCCVII (Fig. 5A, left)
and Lewis lung carcinoma (data not shown) tumors in mice
on the 10% CHO or 5058 diets  the mTOR inhibitor, CCI-779,
and found that, in both, combining the 10% CHO diet with
CCI-779 resulted in an additive effect, with a negligible effect
on mouse weights (Fig. 5A, right). Most exciting, however,
were the results obtained with the 15% CHO diet containing
the COX-2 inhibitor, Celebrex. Not only was tumor growth

4488

Cancer Res; 71(13) July 1, 2011

significantly reduced with the 15% CHO diet containing 1 g/kg
Celebrex, but the overall slope of the tumor growth was lower
(Fig. 5B, left). Once again, there were negligible effects on
mouse weights (Fig. 5B, right), and although the Celebrextreated mice weighed slightly less than the mice not treated
with Celebrex, they did not fall outside the range tested in the
meta-analysis, suggesting that the effect of Celebrex was not
related to lower body weights.
The 15% CHO diet reduces the incidence of tumors in a
spontaneous mouse model of breast cancer
We then asked if our low CHO diets could reduce cancer
incidence in a spontaneous cancer model by using female NOP
mice, which express a dominant-negative allele of p53 and the
HER2/Neu oncogene under the control of the MMTV promoter, thus mimicking human breast cancers (17). These mice
have a 70% to 80% chance of developing mammary tumors
over their lifetime (17). Mice were switched onto the 15% CHO
or 5058 diets when they reached adulthood (8 weeks), and,

9 weeks later, we found that BGs were significantly low in the
15% CHO group (Fig. 6A, left). Interestingly, whereas the
weights were stable in both groups after 8 to 9 weeks on
the diets, they were consistently low in the 15% CHO group
(Fig. 6B), which is not unexpected, given that long-term low
CHO diets reduce body mass (26). Also, plasma insulin levels,
taken at death, were significantly low in the 15% CHO group
(Fig. 6C). Importantly, as shown in Figure 6D, at 1 year of age
almost half the mice on 5058 had developed tumors compared
with none in the mice on the 15% CHO diet. Furthermore, 70%
(7 of 10) of mice on 5058 developed tumors during their life
span, with only 1 reaching normal life expectancy, whereas
less than 30% (3 of 11) of the mice on the 15% CHO diet

developed tumors, with more than half reaching or exceeding
normal life expectancy. Of note, in the 5 mice on the 15% CHO
diet that exceeded normal life spans, only 1 had kidneys that
showed above-normal levels of protein in the urine (data not
shown). These long-term mouse studies suggest that this 15%
high amylose CHO, 58% protein, 26% fat diet is both safe and
efficacious.

Discussion
To exploit the fact that cancer cells rely more heavily on
glycolysis than normal cells, we designed low CHO, high
protein diets to see if we could limit BG and tumor growth.

In designing our diets, we wanted to avoid NCKDs because of
the difficulty in achieving long-term compliance with no CHO
diets in potential future human studies (27) and because
Masko and colleagues recently reported that a 10% or 20%
CHO diet slows tumor growth as effectively as NCKDs (27).
Following early studies with 8% CHO diets, using 10% and 15%
CHO, high protein diets in which 70% of the CHO was in the
form of amylose, we found that, compared with a Western
diet, they were indeed capable of reducing BG, insulin, and
lactate levels and, importantly, in slowing the growth of
implanted murine and human tumors, with little or no effects
on mouse weight.
We assessed the effects of our low CHO diets in both murine
tumor-bearing immunocompetent mice and human tumorbearing immunocompromised mice, because immune status
has been shown to influence tumor growth (7), but found that
low CHO diets slowed tumor growth to a similar extent
without any difference in tumor-associated immune cell
composition between the low CHO and 5058 groups (data
not shown). Of note, Venkateswaran and colleagues recently
found that CHO reduction (from 45% to 10%) slowed the
growth of LNCaP xenografts and attributed this to reduced
insulin like growth factor I (IGF-I) levels (28). Interestingly, we
detected no changes in IGF-I levels in mice on our low CHO

diets, unless there was CR (e.g., with our 8% CHO diet; data not
shown). Our findings suggest that although IGF-I reduction
may be a relevant mechanism in some models, low CHO
diets may also slow tumor growth in an IGF-I–independent
manner.
Given the antitumor effects of ketones and ketosis (29), we
measured plasma b-hydroxybutyrate and found that tumorbearing mice on our 10% diet as well as NOP mice on our 15%
CHO diet for many months had b-hydroxybutyrate levels
similar to mice fed with Western diet (<5 mg/dL; Supplementary Fig. S1), and substantially less than those reported for
mice on NCKDs (15 mg/dL; refs. 27, 30). This is consistent
with very recent studies showing that ketosis requires high
dietary fat (31) and suggests that ketosis does not contribute
to the slower tumor growth we observe with our low CHO
diets.
We also found that our low CHO diets were additive with
the tumor suppressive effects of CCI-779 and Celebrex. Related
to this, while it has been shown that COX-2 is overexpressed in
many human cancers, and that Celebrex may be beneficial in
preventing/slowing colon, breast (32), and prostate cancers
(33, 34) by blocking both omega-6 fatty acid-induced inflammation(33) and tumor-induced angiogenesis (35), high-dose
Celebrex has cardiovascular side effects (36). As our low CHO

diets show additive effects with Celebrex, it might allow for a
lower, safer dose of Celebrex, without loss of therapeutic
efficacy (37).
Although our work strongly suggests that cancer can be
treated and/or prevented by limiting BG, some caution must
be exercised in extrapolating our results to humans. This is
because, while fasting BG levels have been shown to be
significantly reduced in cancer patients on a low CHO diet
(38), they may not be reduced as much as in mice (39). On the
contrary, substantial postprandial reductions in BG have been
reported in humans on low CHO diets (24, 38, 40, 41). Given
that postprandial BG in humans is elevated for up to 2 hours
after a meal and we typically eat 3 or more meals a day, it is
very likely that a low CHO diet will significantly reduce the
daily area-under-the-curve BG exposure. In keeping with this,
it has been reported that low GI meals greatly reduce the BG
area-under-the-curve compared with high GI meals in
humans (40) and that reducing the CHO content of meals
in mild diabetics from 55% to 20% reduces the BG area-underthe-curve by 36%, which is similar to what we see with our
mice (41). Also, our low CHO studies with human HCT-116
cells in Rag2M mice and low CHO studies with other human
tumors (42) suggest that there are no inherent differences
between human and mouse cancer cells in their response to
BG levels. Consistent with the notion that reducing BG in

www.aacrjournals.org

humans can be beneficial, there is a wealth of epidemiologic
evidence showing a clear association between BG and/or
insulin levels (which are determined by BG levels) and the
incidence of human cancers (43–49). Thus, although our
studies were conducted, out of necessity, with mice, the fact
that human BG can be significantly reduced with low CHO
diets and the association of many cancers with high BG levels
suggest that our findings are very likely relevant to human
cancers as well, particularly in cancers that have been associated with higher baseline BG and/or insulin levels, such as
pancreatic (43, 44), breast (45), colorectal (46), endometrial
(47, 48), and esophageal cancers (49).
In addition to these cancers, a low CHO diet may also be
beneficial in early-stage prostate cancer, even though it is not
typically detectable by PET (50). This is because the metastases of these tumors kill the patients and, given the pivotal
role of lactate in promoting metastasis (11), our low CHO diets
could significantly reduce metastasis by reducing tumorassociated lactate levels. In fact, we have preliminary data
suggesting that a low CHO diet plus low dose Celebrex
profoundly reduces the lung metastasis of orthotopically
implanted 4T1 tumor cells (manuscript in preparation).
In terms of macronutrient composition, even though
high protein has been shown to promote satiety (19)—thus
reducing obesity, BG, and insulin levels—and enhance both

antitumor immunity, through amino acid supplementation,
and life span (15, 16, 51), we were concerned, based on the
literature (52–54), that high protein levels might cause
kidney damage. More recent data, however, suggest that
this may only occur in individuals with existing chronic
kidney disease (52, 55) and that in normal people, the
increase in glomerular filtration rate and kidney cellularity
that occur with long-term high protein consumption may be
a normal response (52). Consistent with this, we found that
while the 5 long-lived NOP mice on our 15% CHO diet had
larger than normal kidneys (data not shown), only 1 had
elevated urinary albumin. Moreover, because they lived
beyond the normal life span of C57BL/6 mice on a Western
diet, we can infer that the overall health of the mice was not
adversely affected. In humans, most epidemiologic studies
examining high protein diets and cancer progression have
been confounded by not taking into account protein source,
fat content, and red meat consumption. This is important
because high fat increases cancer risk (56) and plant protein
seems to decrease whereas animal protein increases cancer
mortality (57). Interestingly, colonic cancer-inducing
damage caused by red meats may be avoided with high
amylose, low CHO diets (58). These studies suggest that
macronutrient sources and combinations are very important
and that testing them through highly controlled studies,
such as those achieved with mice, represents a powerful
approach to this question.

Our study, herein, shows that a high amylose containing low
CHO, high protein diet reduces BG, insulin, and glycolysis,
slows tumor growth, reduces tumor incidence, and works
additively with existing therapies without weight loss or
kidney failure. Such a diet, therefore, has the potential of
being both a novel cancer prophylactic and treatment, warranting further investigation of its applicability in the clinic,
especially in combination with existing therapies.
