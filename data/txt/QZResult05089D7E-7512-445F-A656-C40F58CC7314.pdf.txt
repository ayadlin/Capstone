ABSTRACT
Risk assessment for prostate cancer is challenging due to its genetic
heterogeneity. In this study, our goal was to develop an operational framework to
select and evaluate gene variants that may contribute to familial prostate cancer
risk. Drawing on orthogonal sources, we developed a candidate list of genes relevant
to prostate cancer, then analyzed germline exomes from 12 case-only prostate
cancer patients from high-risk families to identify patterns of protein-damaging
gene variants. We described an average of 5 potentially disruptive variants in each
individual and annotated them in the context of public databases representing
human variation. Novel damaging variants were found in several genes of relevance
to prostate cancer. Almost all patients had variants associated with defects in DNA
damage response. Many also had variants linked to androgen signaling. Treatment
of primary T-lymphocytes from these prostate cancer patients versus controls with
DNA damaging agents showed elevated levels of the DNA double strand break (DSB)
marker γH2AX (p < 0.05), supporting the idea of an underlying defect in DNA repair.
This work suggests the value of focusing on underlying defects in DNA damage in
familial prostate cancer risk assessment and demonstrates an operational framework
for exome sequencing in case-only prostate cancer genetic evaluation.

gene mutations of high penetrance that occur in a small
number of families, but also low or moderately penetrant
alterations that are more common, and which may interact
in individuals to promote disease [4–7]. While a few
genes such as BRCA2 and HOXB13 are definitively linked
to prostate cancer risk in specific patient populations
[8–10], a greater proportion of prostate cancer risk may
be associated with common alleles of low-to-intermediate
penetrance or private alleles in families contributing to

INTRODUCTION
Prostate cancer (PCa) is the most common
noncutaneous cancer and the second-leading cause of
cancer-related death in men in the United States [1]. Prior
studies have shown that family history, such as a brother
or father with PCa or relatives affected at an early age, is a
major risk factor [2, 3]. A growing consensus in the field is
that inherited factors for PCa are heterogeneous, involving

cancer risk. While panel testing may be useful in detecting
some of these variants, it is difficult to design a panel that
adequately captures the rapidly increasingly number of
rare variants associated with multiple forms of cancer.
With the cost of DNA sequencing rapidly decreasing,
analysis of exome and genome data is becoming an
alternative approach. However, given the computational
complexity of assessing the many rare variants found
in every individual [11, 12], particularly if multiple
independent variants may be interacting to produce
risk [13], it is important to employ a robust analytic
pathway grounded in understanding of the physiological
basis of the disease.
In addition to genetic heterogeneity of prostate
cancer susceptibility, another common scenario in clinical
cancer risk evaluation that impacts the assessment of
genetic variants is a “case-only” presentation for genetic
testing [14]. This may arise when a patient presents
for cancer risk evaluation with small family structure,
limited family history information, and limited access to
specimens from other affected relatives due to death or
other causes. In this situation, the ability to clarify cancer
susceptibility of genetic variants using family history or
by testing a DNA sample from one or more informative
blood relatives (affected or unaffected with cancer) is not
possible. Such prostate cancer pedigrees will often be
characterized by other cancers, raising the possibility that
some inherited variants may be risk factors for multiple
cancer types. In the clinical cancer risk assessment setting,
novel pathway-based approaches to identifying at-risk
individuals and families are greatly needed.
In this study, we have tested the hypothesis that
germline exome data from individuals with prostate
cancer and a family history of one or more cancer types
would be enriched in damaging variants falling into
two classes. The first class includes variants in genes
associated with defects in the DNA damage response
(DDR) pathway, reflecting the growing recognition that a
number of genes implicated in PCa risk, such as BRIP1,
MSH2, MSH3, CHEK2, and PALB2, have general function
in contributing to early genomic instability in multiple
cancers [15–19]. Of particular relevance to prostate
cancer, the androgen receptor has been found to regulate
a suite of DDR genes, including some that promote
resistance to radiotherapy in prostate cancer in part by
promotion of non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) repair
[20]. The related second class of variants includes those in
genes of sex hormone metabolism previously implicated
as relevant to the pathogenesis of non-familial prostate
cancer [21], including those that regulate androgen
signaling by various mechanisms. Here we present data
on specific pathways analysis of exomes of a group of
case-only prostate cancer patients who underwent clinical
genetic evaluation for inherited cancer risk based on
personal and/or family cancer features. We identify likely
predisposing variants in every case, with a particular
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

bias towards evidence of DDR-impairing defects in most
cases. Based on this work, we perform functional testing
that directly demonstrated increased sensitivity to DNA
damaging agents in lymphocytes from prostate cancer
patients bearing predicted DNA damaging alleles. This
work begins to develop an operational framework for
exome sequencing in case-only prostate cancer genetic
evaluation.

RESULTS
Development of a high value list of
candidate genes
To meet the goal of developing an operational
framework for assessing case-only patients, we developed
a comprehensive, hypothesis-based candidate gene list
for particular scrutiny (Supp. Table S1). To this end, we
integrated top scoring candidates from a number of existing
sources that collated genes based on orthogonal selection
criteria (Table 2). The primary hypothesis for this purpose
was that rare variants leading to defects in DDR would be
important in predisposition for general cancer risk, while the
secondary hypothesis was that rare variants damaging genes
associated with androgen signaling or prostate function
would provide a bias for cancer in the prostate.
To identify a relevant candidate set we queried
the Wood group website, which maintains an updated
comprehensive list of genes linked to DNA damage
response [35]. This list was extended with genes described
by Polkinghorn and colleagues, who have noted a subset of
DNA repair genes specifically regulated by the androgen
receptor (AR) [20] (see Figure 2A). The Human Protein
Reference Database (HPRD) [36] provided lists of genes that
interacted physically or functionally with the well-validated
risk factor BRCA1, as well as the AR. Providing broader
context relevant to AR signaling, several recent studies have
provided lists of genes mutated at appreciable frequencies
in sporadic prostate cancer [37, 38], including castration
resistant prostate cancer [39]. The TARGET database
(Tumor Alterations Relevant for Genomics-Driven Therapy)
[38] provides a broader list of genes of clinical value for
cancer treatment, based on their roles as tumor drivers.
Sun and colleagues developed a list of single nucleotide
polymorphisms (SNPs) affecting sex hormone metabolism,
some of which showed significant or near-significant linkage
to prostate cancer aggressiveness at diagnosis [21].
Finally, as a tertiary hypothesis, we also considered
that non-rare variants, or variants in genes linked to cancers
other than prostate, might contribute to prostate cancer risk in
some circumstances. Typically, a threshold of 1% for a minor
frequency allele (MAF) is used to filter out non-rare variants
as insignificant in the absence of clear clinical indication
of phenotypic effect [14]. However, a growing body of
evidence suggests that cancer risk reflects the interaction of
multiple predisposing factors [13, 40, 41], suggesting such

had reported being white and non-Hispanic: Table 3
describes the frequency of each variant in the subset
of ~30,000 European non-Finnish individuals of the
Exome Aggregation Consortium (ExAC) database; these
frequencies were in agreement with those reported in an
independent (ITMI) cohort of 634 white non-Hispanic
individuals who denied a personal or family history of
cancer (Supp Table S4). Thirty alterations identified
in the prostate cancer patients in this study were
found in fewer than 20 individuals in the ExAC database
(< 0.0003%), with 10 alterations never previously
reported. In addition, a number of non-rare variants in
genes relevant to cancer risk (e.g. in BRCA1, PALB2,
BLM, and others) were detected in a significant number
of individuals.

Identification of genetic variants in the prostate
cancer patient cohort
Focusing on this candidate list, we analyzed rare
single nucleotide variants (SNVs) causing missense
mutations, frameshift or nonsense mutations predicted to
result in early truncation of protein and short in-frame
insertions or deletions (indels) (Supp Tables S2, S3).
SNVs were only considered further if they passed
an initial test in which multiple predictor algorithms
indicated the variant would disrupt protein function (see
Methods and Supp Table S2 for comprehensive analysis).
Table 3 summarizes the significant variants found
in each of the 12 patients (with extended information
in Supp Table S4). All variants listed in Table 3 passed
Sanger validation. Each patient had variants affecting
3 to 7 genes on the candidate list. All 12 patients

cohort, with 11/12 patients having at least 1 affected gene
in this category, and 5/12 having 2 or more. These genes
included PALB2 (also known as FANCN), APTX, BLM,
BRCA1, CTBP1, DDB2, FANCA, FANCL, MBD5, MSH3,
NEIL3, RAD51D, RAD54L2 (also known as ARIP4), SP1,
TP53BP1, UBE2D3, UBE2V2 (also known as MMS2).
Many of the proteins encoded by these genes interact to
mediate DNA repair functions (Figure 2B, 2C)
For some patients, a single variant seemed likely
to pose substantial risk, such as the frameshift variant
E1002Tfs*4 in PALB2 found patient 129748. This
patient was diagnosed at age 41, with a father who was
also diagnosed with prostate cancer at age 67. PALB2
truncating mutations have been detected in patients with
Fanconi’s anemia and various cancers [18], including
prostate [15]. Importantly, PALB2 p.E1002Tfs*4 lacks
part of the WD40 repeat domain (amino acids 853–1186)

known to mediate protein interactions with key proteins
involved in homologous recombination (HR) such as
BRCA2 and RAD51 [42, 43]. Potentially magnifying
the effect of the PALB2 truncation, this patient also has a
mutation (p.R101Q) predicted to damage in the ubiquitin
conjugating enzyme UBE2V2, identified as a factor
required for avoidance of UV damage [44], with expression
of UBE2V2 linked to prognosis in breast cancers following
treatment with DNA damaging therapies [45].
Some patients had suggestive combinations of
rare variants. For example, patient 117939 has three
independent mutations likely to directly impact DNA
damage response: FANCL p.T367Nfs*13, MSH3
p.I929T, and RAD54L2 p.I730F (Figure 2B). FANCL is
an E3 ubiquitin ligase of the Fanconi Anemia (FA) core
complex. The mutation T367Nfs*13 produces a protein
with premature truncation and three novel amino acids at

the C-terminus, and has been described in an FA patient
[46]. This mutation produces a hypomorphic mutation
with only partial correction of mitomycin C sensitivity
and chromosomal defects [46]. MSH3 heterodimerizes
with MSH2 to mediate mismatch repair; variants in MSH3
have been associated with risk of some forms of cancer,
including prostate [47, 48]. Importantly, crosstalk between
FA and MSH2/MSH3 in the mismatch repair pathway
has been well documented, with the two operating as
redundant DNA damage sensors [49–51]. RAD54L2/
ARIP4 is a DNA helicase that binds the AR, and
modulates AR-dependent transactivation in a promoterdependent manner, and has been linked to a role in DNA
repair [48, 52, 53]. I730 is just downstream of one of the
three LXXLL motifs, also known as nuclear boxes, that
mediate protein-protein interactions.
In some cases, combinations involving non-rare
variants of DDR genes were suggestive. Patient 124604,
diagnosed with prostate cancer at age 43, has a pedigree
that shows cases of prostate cancer over 3 generations.
This patient carries 3 non-rare missense variants in genes
involved in DDR: BLM p.P868L, PALB2 p.G998E, and
FANCA p.S1088F. BLM encodes a 3′-5′ DNA helicase
which functions in maintenance of genomic stability, with
inactivating mutations associated with a progeria, Bloom
Syndrome (BS). BLM p.P868L has been characterized
as an allele that is unlikely to cause BS, but causes
partial loss of function manifested by an intermediate
sensitivity to hydroxyurea [54], and has been associated
with increased rectal cancer risk [55]. Interestingly,
an uncle of patient 124604 had colorectal cancer. The
PALB2 p.G998E variant in this patient was reported at
a similar frequency of ~ 10% in a population of BRCA1and BRCA2-negative male breast cancer patients in
Northern Italy as was observed in healthy individuals [56].
A similar high rate of occurrence in normal populations
was observed for FANCA p.S1088F (9/97 in breast cancer
cases vs 11/94 in controls) [57]. However, the assortment
of three independent alleles affecting DNA repair in the
pedigree of this patient may have an additive effect, given
the involvement of all three proteins in related DNA repair
pathways (Figure 2B).
In a similar case, Patient 112940 had a rare variant
causing a stop at amino acid 56, eliminating function of
APTX (aprataxin), involved in the repair of multiple forms
of DNA breaks and implicated in therapeutic response
in cancer [58–60], and a second rare variant (p.F460C)
damaging NEIL3, a DNA glycosylase involved in the
base excision repair pathways that protects cells from
genotoxic stress and has been associated with prostate
cancer risk [61, 62]. Interestingly, this patient as well as
3 other unrelated individuals (Patients 117197, 126002,
and 129413) all had the same non-rare variant in BRCA1,
p.Q356R, which some prior studies have linked to prostate
cancer risk [63]; an observed incidence of 33%, versus
the expected incidence of this variant should be 9%,
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

based on ExAC. Like patient 112940, the other patients
also possessed multiple additional candidate rare variants
affecting DNA damage response and/or genes related
to androgen function. Patient 129413 had a mutation
disrupting TP53BP1 (p.I455_P456del, predicted to be
deleterious by PROVEAN), TP53BP1 competes with
BRCA1 for directing proteins down the non-homologous
end joining (NHEJ) versus homologous recombination
(HR) repair pathway (Figure 2C) [64–67]; in the context
of impaired TP53BP1, or other DDR defects, and as
discussed further below, the BRCA1 variant may have a
more deleterious effect.
In some cases, patients have mutational profiles
in which disruption of DDR and AR signaling is closely
linked. For example, patient 125671 has an in-frame
deletion (p.R47del) in the AR-interacting protein DDB2:
the R47 residue mediates high affinity binding of DDB2
to damaged DNA [68, 69]. This patient also has an S221N
variant predicted to be highly deleterious (Figure 3A) in
AKR1C1, a member of an enzyme family that controls
concentrations of active androgens and other steroidal
hormones, regulates trans-activation of AR in the prostate,
and has been shown to regulate resistance to the antiandrogen enzalutamide, recently approved for treatment
of castration resistant prostate cancer [70, 71].
Patient 123136 comes from a family with a high
burden of cancer, with a sister affected with melanoma and
breast cancer, father with lung cancer, and mother with
colon cancer. This patient has a rare variant (p.P421L) of
CtBP1, a coregulator of BRCA1, which has been linked
to risk of prostate cancer [72, 73]. Activation of the
AR regulator HIPK2 (Homeodomain-Interacting Protein
Kinase 2) [74] by genotoxic stress triggers apoptosis in
part through phosphorylation of CtBP1, which causes
CtBP1 degradation [75]; loss of this signaling could
plausibly cause predisposition to multiple forms of cancer.
P421L destroys the HIPK2 phosphorylation site on CtBP1.

Other classes of variants
In addition to the selected examples described above,
rare variants were identified in all of the categories of
interest from the candidate list. Due to space limitations,
all profiles cannot be fully detailed. However, some
observed allelic combinations are of interest, particularly
in regard to androgen availability and AR-dependent
transcription. Consideration of these variant combinations
may be particularly important in suggesting a possible
explanation for why mutations in the DDR machinery,
which theoretically could increase risk of any type of
cancer, could result in a familial predilection for prostate
cancer.
As selected examples, two patients, 129547 and
117939, had disruptive mutations in NRIP1 (also known as
RIP140), a co-receptor for estrogen, androgen, and other
classes of nuclear hormone receptor. Disruption of NRIP1
39621

Oncotarget

function has been reported to lead to hyperactivation of
AR signaling [76], and variants in NRIP1 have been linked
to risk in breast, endometrial, and other cancers [77, 78].
Interestingly, patient 129547 also has a rare variant
affecting a second AR co-repressor, NCOR2 (also known
as SMRT) that limits AR signaling [79], while patient
117939 has a rare variant in an alternative AR cofactor,
RAD54L2 (also known as androgen receptor interacting
protein 4, ARIP4) [80]. These variant pairs may interact
to de-repress AR signaling in these two patients. Another
patient, 117197, has a frameshift variant (Q1340Rfs*43)
in EFCAB6 (also known as DJBP), which encodes
a protein that recruits histone-deacetylase (HDAC)
complexes to repress AR-dependent transcription [81]; the
variant eliminates the HDAC-interaction domain. Patient
124604, noted above as having 3 variants in DDR-related
proteins (BLM, PALB2, and FANCA), has a family with
prostate cancer over 3 generations. This patient also has
a splice site-disrupting variant in CRISP3 (cysteine-rich
secretary protein 3). Expression of CRISP3 is prostatespecific, and CRISP3 is up-regulated in a subset of
prostate cancers [82], especially prostate cancer with the
TMPRSS2-ERG fusion gene [83]. Mis-splicing due to the
G/A mutation in 6:49700908 would destroy the CRISP
domain (pfam: 08562), which allows CRISP3 to regulate
ryanodine receptor Ca2+ signaling. Interestingly, ExAC
data indicates the position is multi-allelic with another
allele (T) mainly represented in African populations.
A major function of the prostate is in production
of glycoproteins, including PSA, that support sperm
production, and changes in glycosylation are associated
with prostatic neoplasms [84] and response to androgen
treatment [85]. Among a number of variants in genes
linked to glycosylation defects (PAPSS2, ATP6V0A2,
ALG13, MGAT2, B3GAT3, DOLK), the variant in
PAPSS2 seems the most interesting. This variant
(p.P454L; Figure 3B) is strongly predicted to destroy
the catalytic function of PAPSS2, a kinase and ATP
sulfurylase that catalyzes two sequential reactions to
synthesize PAPS, the sulfate source for sulfation of the
androgen precursor didehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA).
Of particular relevance to prostate cancer, two mutations
in PAPSS2 have been reported as causing androgen excess
via complete (W362Cfs*3) or partial (G270D) disruption
of DHEA sulfation [86].

and gender-matched individuals without a cancer diagnosis
or a family history of cancer. Immunofluorescence
was used to assay the formation of DSB-associated γ
(phospho)-H2AX foci in cells with and without treatment
with the DNA polymerase inhibitor aphidicolin or the
topoisomerase II inhibitor etoposide. Under baseline
conditions without drug treatment, the patient and control
groups were statistically indistinguishable (p = 0.746)
(Figure 4A). However, treatment of cells with low doses of
aphidicolin (p = 0.0337) or etoposide (p = 0.007) revealed
significant differences in γH2AX induction between cases
and controls, with a higher magnitude of induction seen in
prostate cancer patients (Figure 4B). Receiver operating
characteristic (ROC) curve analysis for the combination
of both treatments indicated specificity and selectivity of
observed differences were 87% (Figure 4C).

DISCUSSION
With the growing availability of powerful
technologies for genomic analysis, cancer risk assessment
is at a key point of potentially benefitting from advances
in sequencing. Some large families with detailed family
cancer history are in the unambiguous situation of
having a well-defined mutation in a highly penetrant
gene. However, a significant proportion of families
have limitations in family cancer history information,
making exploratory studies such as this one useful in
defining strategies for potential clinical evaluation. In
this study, we have focused most effort on the analysis
of defects in DDR in case-only individuals with prostate
cancer and strong family cancer history. This approach
has identified variants or variant combinations in almost
every patient assessed that have the potential to alter
response to DNA damage, with findings further supported
by direct demonstration of elevated expression of γH2AX
following administration of DNA damaging stimuli. In the
group of patients we examined, variants often occurred
in combinations that would be predicted to interact to
weaken DDR, and typically each variant was unique to the
individuals investigated. These findings suggest that DDR
defects may play a role in prostate cancer predisposition,
similar to other hereditary cancers such as breast [87] and
colorectal [88]. Two recent studies identified a high burden
of germline mutations affecting DDR genes in somatic
prostate cancers [89–91].
This study also suggests that non-rare variants
affecting DDR may play a role in prostate cancer risk
upon further study. For example, in the cohort analyzed
here, 33% of patients had the same non-rare p.Q356R
variant in BRCA1. BRCA1 p.Q356R is an example of
a variant that has a frequency of minor allele over 5%
and an increased odds ratio for breast cancer over 1.5 in
carriers. In a study on association between prostate cancer
risk and SNPs in a 200 kb area around the BRCA1 gene,

Functional defects in response to DNA damaging
agents in the lymphocytes of patients of prostate
cancer patients with familial risk
Given the strong implication of defects in genes
involved in DNA repair as causative factors for numerous
classes of hereditary cancer, these genes were of particular
interest. PBLs were available for 9/12 patients, allowing us
to assess whether the response of these cells to low doses
of DNA damaging agents differed from those of 10 age

the strongest link was for BRCA1 p.Q356R [63], with the
R allele preferentially transmitted to men affected with
prostate cancer before the age of 50. Mechanistically,
Q356 is of particular interest as it is located in the
MRE11/RAD50/NBS1 (MRN) domain, required for
interaction with RAD51, p53, ZBRK1, SWI/SNF,
BRAP2, ATPase, and Importin α [92]. Q356R disrupts
the interaction between BRCA1 and ZBRK1, eliminating
the transcriptional co-repressor function of BRCA1 [93],
leading to upregulation of such BRCA1 target genes as
angiopoietin-1 (ANG1), which promotes angiogenesis

and proliferation [94]. In a study of 931 PCa patients,
13 independent variants of uncertain significance were
identified in the MRE11/RAD50/NBS1 domain including
Q356R [15]. Our data raises the idea that BRCA1 Q356R
may be significant in the context of other variants that
weaken DDR.
DDR genes are active in many tissues; hence, the
fact that the patients analyzed developed prostate cancer
as well as multiple other cancers in their families may
reflect the contribution of multiple modifier variants. Our
candidate approach also considered variants predicted to

of progesterone to the less potent 20α-hydroxyl-pregn-4-ene-3-one. The reaction is NADPH dependent with an obligatory requirement for
the cofactor to bind before the steroid substrate can bind to form the central complex. The progesterone is maintained in a steroid binding
site at H222; an H222I mutation decreases the Km value for NADPH 95-fold [102]. Here, AKR1C1 (PDB code: 1MRQ) is shown with
bound steroid 20alpha-hydroxy-progesterone, and the cofactor, NADP+ in ball-and-stick representation with cyan carbons, and orange
phosphorus atoms. S221 and adjacent catalytic residue H222 of AKR1C1 are shown with magenta sticks. S221 is involved in 2 hydrogen
bonds (shown with cyan thin lines) with adjacent residues and one with the NADP+ cofactor. Though predicted to be benign by several
conservation based servers, the S221N substitution disrupts the hydrogen-bonding network required to maintain the catalytic active site
configuration. B. Shown are the PAPSS2 kinase domain in green, PUA (PseudoUridine synthase and Archaeosine transglycosylase) domain

influence signaling by androgens and other hormones, or
prostate-specific functions such as control of glycosylation
and a number of damaging rare variants were also found in
these genes in the sequenced probands. Our data suggests
these gene pathways are worth following as genomic
characterization of prostate and other hereditary tumors
advances.

An important issue is how to determine if detected
germline variants are indeed functional to inform cancer
risk assessment. Recent studies have reported that
evaluations of the germline DNA of “normal” individuals
identifies a surprisingly high burden of variants that
would seem to be predisposing to cancer and other
diseases [11, 95]. Furthermore, variants may be detected

in genes that are not expressed in the prostate or affected
tissue [96–98]. These points highlight the need for
functional studies to follow-up on detection of germline
variants. In this study, the functional testing of patientderived PBLs has supported the idea that responses to
DNA damage in prostate cancer patients differ from
those found in age and gender-matched controls. This
approach can potentially be extended using systematic
cell-based functional assays for phenotyping of missense
alleles [99].
Ultimately, these results suggest that future
strategies for risk assessment may involve a diagnostic
algorithm in which high-risk patients initially are
tested for well-validated, high penetrance variants,
using standard panel-based screens. If initial testing
fails to identify causative mutations, exome-testing
focusing on cancer-relevant processes, supported by
functional testing for defects in the process, may be a
useful alternative approach that should be evaluated
in a prospective setting. Another potentially valuable
aspect of such broader testing may be implications for
patient treatment. Identifying a variant that renders the
cell dependent on a specific pathway may create an
opportunity for synthetic lethality, as in the example of
BRCA mutations and PARP inhibitors [100]. Broader
approaches for functional assessment of germline
variants are also needed to better inform cancer risk
assessment and recommendations.

Exome sequencing of germline DNA was performed
by Ambry Genetics (Aliso Viejo, CA) at 30X average
coverage using a VCRome kit (Roche Nimblegen,
Madison WI) for library preparation, indexing and
100 bp paired end processing using the HiSeq platform
(Illumina, Hayward, CA). Human hg19 reference-guided
alignment and variant calling were done using the Illumina
CASAVA software pipeline. Heuristic filtering processes
were applied to remove variants that fall into non-coding
regions, with synonymous effect, or common variants
found in the 1000 genomes, dbSNP or Exome Sequencing
Project (ESP) database. The Ambry Variant Analyzer
(AVA™) produced candidate mutation short lists of rare
variants by restricting to variants fitting a dominant/
recessive model of inheritance, as well as listing variants
associated with hereditary and somatic cancers, regardless
of frequency (i.e., including non-rare variants).

Development of a high value list of
candidate genes
The candidate gene list (Supp Table S1) was
assembled from the sources listed in Table 2. Genes
collected from various sources were prescreened for possible
aliases by using G-convert from G-profiler (http://biit.cs.ut.
ee/gprofiler/gconvert.cgi) in batch mode to ensure use of
official gene symbols with  Entrez ID numbers. Manual
curation using (http://www.genenames.org/) from the
Human Genome Organization (HUGO) Gene Nomenclature
Committee (HGNC) was done when G-convert did not
return information. PCAP, PCA3 and HPC6, which were
listed as loci relevant to prostate cancer by at least one
source, were not included as they fall under the HGNC locus
type “phenotype only”, indicating the causative gene has
not been identified. Non-coding transcripts such as PCAT4,
5 and 6 and pseudogenes were excluded.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
A flowchart for the analysis in the study is provided
in Figure 1.

Patient selection
Case-only prostate cancer patients included in this
study (n = 12) had undergone evaluation for inherited
cancer risk. Each participant had a strong family
cancer history as shown in Table 1, with either multiple
first-degree or second-degree relatives with prostate or
other cancers. The mean age at prostate cancer diagnosis
was 57.8 years (range 41–68 years). Fifty-eight percent
had Gleason score > = 7, and 25% had advanced stage
disease (T3). Hereditary cancer syndromes evaluated
in these families included hereditary breast-ovarian
cancer (HBOC), Lynch syndrome (LS), and hereditary
prostate cancer (HPC) [22–24]. No pathogenic mutations
were identified from sequencing the following genes:
BRCA1, BRCA2, MLH1, MSH2, PMS2, MSH6, and
HOXB13. These patients had consented to the FCCC Risk
Assessment Program Registry, which allowed further
research genomic sequencing. All patients reported being
white, non-Hispanic. Peripheral blood DNA from these
12 prostate cancer patients was sent to Ambry Genetics
for exome sequencing.

Variant selection
By analysis through its AVA™ filtering software,
Ambry produced lists of rare variants (defined as
frequency less than 1% in the general population) for each
patient. From these combined lists, 84 single nucleotide
variations (SNVs) with more than 3 reads, Q score above
25 and leading to non-synonymous changes at the protein
level in candidate genes were extracted. Variants leading
to non-synonymous changes in encoded proteins were
selected if they received scores indicating a proteindamaging function with at least 3 of 5 in silico predictors
(PolyPhen-2 with HumDiv as model classifier [25],
SIFT [26], PROVEAN [27], MutationAssessor [28], and
MutationTaster [29]). The conversion of the calls made
by each predictor into neutral vs. non-neutral was made
using an approach that integrates different predictive
algorithms [12]. For PolyPhen-2, “probably damaging”

12 DNA samples isolated from peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs) of 12 patients with prostate cancer were sent to Ambry Genetics for
exome sequencing. Data analysis included identification of the rare variants in 826 genes selected as described in Table 2 and validation by
Sanger sequencing of the variants that scored non neutral by at least 3 in silico predictors. Two variants (in AKR1C1 and PAPSS2) were
further characterized by molecular modeling. PBLs were also used to assess the response to DNA damaging agents.

MutationAssessor, “high” and “medium” were considered
non-neutral. For MutationTaster, “disease causing”
and “disease causing_automatic” were considered nonneutral and “polymorphism” and “polymorphism_
automatic” neutral. “Damaging” (SIFT) and “deleterious”
(PROVEAN) were considered non-neutral while
“tolerated” (SIFT) and “neutral” (PROVEAN) were
considered neutral. For MutationTaster, 0.99 was used as
cut-off in the disease_causing category.
In-frame deletion (Indel) variants were
characterized with PROVEAN and MutationTaster.
Indels that had a length divisible by 3 and caused amino
acid insertion/deletion (also called 3N indels) were
also analyzed with SIFT-Indel (http://sift-dna.org) [30].
Variants associated with possible splicing defects were
also selected. Mutalyzer 2.0.4 (http://mutalyzer.nl/)
was used to ascertain that the variants were described
according to the Human Genome Variation Society
(HGVS) nomenclature, effectively matching described
amino acid and nucleotide coordinates to the GRCh37/
hg19 assembly [31].

For analysis of structural consequences of
missense variants, models of PAPSS2 and AKR1C1
were generated. All molecular display figures were
prepared with the UCSF Chimera software [32]. While
the N-terminal kinase domain is of known structure
(2AX4), a full-length model of PAPSS2 was generated
with Biological Assembly Modeler [33] based on the
closest homolog of known structure, PAPSS1 (PDB code
1XNJ, 77% identity, 87% similarity), and compared
with a previously deposited model [34]. An alternate
template structure (2QJF) was superposed to extract the
placement of the substrate and product molecules, (ADP
and Adenosine-5′-phosphosulfate). For the variant in
AKR1C1, the structure with PDB code 1MRQ was used.

Lymphocyte cell preservation, culture, and
analysis of DNA damage response (DDR)
Peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs) were
available from 9/12 of the exome sequenced patients
and 10 age-matched and gender-matched individuals
without a cancer diagnosis or a family history of
cancer. Control samples were obtained from the FCCC
Biosample Repository Facility. For analysis of DDR,
cells were cultured in RPMI-1640 containing 15% fetal
bovine serum (HyClone Laboratories, Logan, UT), 2 mM
L-glutamine (Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY),
50  μM 2-mercaptoethanol (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis,
MO), 0.2 units human recombinant insulin (Sigma)
per ml, 50 units penicillin and 50 mg streptomycin
per ml (complete RPMI), and then stimulated with
phytohemagglutinin (PHA)-M (Life Technologies,
Grand Island, NY) and recombinant human interleukin
2 (IL-2) (NCI Preclinical Repository) for 72 hours. Cells
were then treated with vehicle, 10 μM aphidicolin or
25 μM etoposide, and fixed in paraformaldehyde 2 hours
later. For immunofluorescence, cells were allowed to
attach to poly-d-lysine-coated 96-well plates, stained with
anti-γH2AX antibody (#05–636, Millipore, Temecula,
CA). Sixteen images per well were acquired at 20X
(with each image acquired in 2 channels to detect γH2AX
with TRITC and total DNA with DAPI) utilizing the
ImageXpress micro automated microscope (Molecular

Variant verification
The Exome Aggregation Consortium (ExAC)
website, Cambridge, MA (version 0.3) (http://exac
.broadinstitute.org/) was used to assess the frequency
of the selected variants in the general population or in
a particular ethnic group. The ExAC data set contains
information on 60,706 unrelated individuals sequenced
as part of various disease-specific and population genetic
studies, approximately 50% of who are of European
non-Finnish ancestry. A second independent group of
controls, referred to as ITMI genomes and representing
an extension of the set initially described in [11],
consisted of 634 white non-Hispanic individuals who
denied a personal or family history of cancer. For all
variants with predicted protein-damaging consequences,
primers flanking the variation were designed to amplify
a product of ~200 to 400 base pairs. After digestion with
ExoSap-IT (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA), the PCR
product was sent to Genewiz (South Plainfield, NJ) for
Sanger sequencing.
