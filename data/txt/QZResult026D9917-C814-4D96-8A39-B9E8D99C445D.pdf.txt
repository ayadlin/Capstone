nfortunately, epithelial cancer of the ovary remains one of the
most frequently fatal gynecologic malignancies, with a 5-year
survival rate of only 29% to 50%.1–3 Many prognostic indicators
have been proposed besides histological type, including age, grade
of differentiation, number of mitosis, stage of disease, residual tumor after surgery, and level of cytoreduction. Although many studies have indicated that the prognosis of ovarian carcinoma is
mainly based on the stage of disease,1,4,5 histological type and grade
are also considered to be important factors in determining prognosis and treatment choice.1,2,6 Grading is perhaps as important as tumor staging and may be superior to classiﬁcation of histologic type
as a prognostic factor.3,7 The high-grade lesions, even at low stage,
need particular attention because they are more aggressive than
low-grade counterparts in the same low stage.2 Histological type,
however, may be superior in predicting tumor responsiveness to
chemotherapy.7 Platinum-based chemotherapy is widely accepted
as the best ﬁrst-line therapy, but published data indicate8 that serous adenocarcinomas of the ovary have a better prognosis and better sensitivity to the above-mentioned therapy compared with clear
cell carcinomas. Other studies show that mucinous carcinomas and
carcinosarcomas are also less responsive to platinum-based chemotherapy.9,10
In this issue of Cancer, Storey et al.11 report on their 20-year,
single-institution experience with a detailed comparison of pureendometrioid and pure-serous subtypes of ovarian epithelial carcinoma, including stage-for-stage survival and response rates to platinum-based chemotherapy. The report is based on their experience
with 1545 patients with ovarian cancer, including 270 pure-endometrioid and 659 pure-serous adenocarcinomas. The clinicopathologic
characteristics including overall survival, stage-for-stage median
progression-free survival, and cause-speciﬁc median survival were
compared. Independent predictors of survival (histologic type,
debulking status, disease stage) after platinum-based chemotherapy
were examined by using multivariate analysis. Their surgical
approach was similar to that used in the United States with the
exception of lymphadenectomy, which was not routinely performed.
These investigators found that endometrioid tumors presented
more often with early disease (stages I and II, 50% vs 17%, respectively; P < .001), had less ascites, and had better performance status,
both overall and for stage II and stage III disease. More endometrioid tumors overall were optimally debulked (71% vs 45%; P < .001),

but there was no difference according to stage.
Objective, as well as Ca125 (an ovarian cancer
marker used as an indicator of response to chemotherapy and disease remission) response rates were
not signiﬁcantly different, but median progressionfree survival was better for patients with endometrioid tumors (24 months vs 13 months; P < .0001)
as well overall median survival (48 months vs 22
months; P < .0001). This relation remained for stage
II and stage III disease and for moderately and
poorly differentiated tumors. There were no signiﬁcant differences between the 2 histologies for stage I
or IV disease. Patients with concurrent endometrioid
ovarian and endometrial malignancies had a survival
advantage compared with those with ovarian carcinoma alone. Story et al. concluded that despite similar response rates to platinum-based therapy,
endometrioid histology is associated with better survival compared with serous tumors, even with stage
III or when poorly differentiated. After patients
received platinum-based chemotherapy, the histological type, along with debulking status and FIGO
stage, was an independent predictor of survival.
Story et al. also concluded that endometrioid histology is associated with a better survival compared
with serous histology regardless of response to therapy. On the basis of the ﬁndings of this study, the
chemotherapeutic response of endometrioid ovarian
cancer does not appear to differ sufﬁciently from
that of serous tumors.
It is worth mentioning that this is the ﬁrst study
to be large enough to allow investigation of the effect
of histological type in patients treated with ‘‘modern’’
therapy, including platinum-based chemotherapy.
Their study conﬁrms ﬁndings of several previous
smaller studies1–3,12 that endometrioid histology is
associated with improved survival when compared
with serous histology. However, it excludes so-called
mixed epithelial carcinomas. Published data indicate
the critical importance of a serous component in
mixed epithelial tumors (endometrioid mixed with
either papillary serous carcinomas or undifferentiated carcinomas), as the presence of even a small
component—as little as 10%—of more aggressive serous or undifferentiated morphology appears to
adversely affect prognosis.13,14 Thus, when dealing
with high-stage tumors, thorough sampling becomes
very important, as high-stage pure-endometrioid
adenocarcinomas are reportedly uncommon.14
There has been recent interest in reassessing
how epithelial ovarian carcinomas are classiﬁed and
graded. Whereas Storey et al. used the established
FIGO (International Federation of Gynecology and
Obstetrics) system, recent studies have proposed

2109

other histological grading schemes. Two newer proposals are signiﬁcant in this regard. The Silverberg
grading system incorporates nuclear grading and architectural and mitotic scoring, analogous to the
Nottingham score, in invasive breast carcinomas.7
When applied to a series of ovarian carcinomas from
a single institution to evaluate its prognostic signiﬁcance in relation to other predictive factors, it
yielded prognostically relevant information.15 A 2tier system proposed by Malpica et al. is based primarily on the assessment of nuclear atypia with the
mitotic rate as a secondary feature. There is good
correlation with both the Silverberg and the FIGO
grading systems, but Malpica et al.’s system uses
only 2 diagnostic categories and is based on deﬁned
criteria that are easy to follow; it may well improve
reproducibility.16 The use of such schema may aid in
the development of different therapeutic strategies
for low-grade versus high-grade tumors, as low-grade
tumors appear to be biologically different, as they
express signiﬁcantly higher levels of estrogen and
progesterone receptors, and E-cadherin, whereas
high-grade tumors tend toward increased expression
of MMP-9, BCL1, p53, and Ki-67, with robust MMP-9
positivity in the stromal component.17
Recent molecular studies have suggested that
epithelial ovarian cancers arise through distinctly different oncogenetic pathways, and morphology alone
may not be sufﬁcient to determine the tumor’s nature. Multiple molecular changes, including activation of proto-oncogenes and inactivation of tumor
suppressor genes, are involved in the development
of human ovarian cancer. Several studies have
demonstrated frequent PTEN alterations in endometrioid adenocarcinomas,18–20 supporting the view
that these tumors develop along a fundamentally different pathway from those of serous and mucinous
ovarian tumors. PTEN mutations are detected not
only in the endometrioid type, but also in serous
and mucinous types of ovarian cancer, suggesting
that the PTEN gene plays an important role in the
development of a diverse subset of histological types
of ovarian tumors, although it is possible that
another tumor-suppressor gene in the close vicinity
of the PTEN gene is also inactivated.21 Studies have
shown that frequent KRAS oncogene activation and/
or overexpression are speciﬁc for mucinous tumors,
including carcinomas and adenomas, and suggest a
mucinous differentiation, rather than a malignant
transformation.22–24 Inactivation or mutation of p53
is detected in 30% to 40% of ovarian carcinomas,
more frequently seen in serous carcinomas, and suggests that p53 mutations may be directly involved in
malignant transformation.23–25 DCC and FHIT altera-

tions are also rather frequent,23 and gain of FGF3/4
and CCNE1 is found in all serous adenocarcinomas.26
Recently, a dualistic model of ovarian carcinogenesis has been proposed, which suggests that lowgrade and high-grade (conventional) serous carcinomas arise via different pathways; the former progressing along adenoma-borderline tumor-carcinoma
sequence involving mutations in KRAS and BRAF,
and the latter from alterations in surface epithelial
inclusion involving mutations of TP53 and dysfunction of BRCA1 and/or BRCA2.22,27,28 In other words,
the P53 expression status (normal vs aberrant)
divides serous ovarian carcinomas into 2 distinct
subtypes: one with a relatively good prognosis and
the other with a particularly poor outcome.29 These
molecular pathways may be responsible for sensitivity or resistance to platinum-based chemotherapy. In
their study, Storey et al. indicate that platinum
response rates in endometrioid and serous tumors
were similar, thus suggesting that p53 gene status
may not be an important determinant of platinum
response.11 Other studies, however, have shown that
P53 alterations correlate signiﬁcantly with resistance
to platinum-based chemotherapy, early relapse, and
shortened overall survival in ovarian cancer
patients.30
Clinicopathologic studies such as that of Story
and his colleagues are important. However, in the
case of epithelial ovarian carcinoma, the story has
just begun, and the addition of molecular data and
its interplay with reﬁned histological criteria are
likely to lead to signiﬁcant changes in how we view
and treat these tumors in the not-too-distant future.
