Redundancy: A Critical Obstacle to Improving
Cancer Therapy
Orit Lavi

Abstract
A system characterized by redundancy has various elements
that are able to act in the same biologic or dynamic manner,
where the inhibition of one of those elements has no signiﬁcant
effect on the global biologic outcome or on the system's dynamic behavior. Methods that aim to predict the effectiveness
of cancer therapies must include evolutionary and dynamic

features that would change the static view that is widely accepted. Here, we explore several important issues about mechanisms
of redundancy, heterogeneity, biologic importance, and drug
resistance and describe methodologic challenges that, if overcome, would signiﬁcantly contribute to cancer research. Cancer

Introduction

upstream elements). One of the major obstacles to improving
cancer therapy is the cell's ability to compensate for a targeted
gene/pathway. There are many examples indicating that redundancy serves as a resistance mechanism with clinical implications. For instance, several different ABC transporters can confer
resistance to the same drugs, so inhibitors, such as cyclosporin,
must target all of these transporters to be effective in reversing
transporter-related multidrug resistance (12). Another example
of treatment is traditional chemotherapy with broad-spectrum
cytotoxic drugs. Those cytotoxic drugs aim to increase the
apoptosis rate through accumulation of damage to DNA and
other cell structures such as membranes and microtubules.
Although, in general, chemotherapy has the most positive
results as a therapy for disseminated cancer, it increases the
tumor-cell rates of genetic and epigenetic alterations, and can be
predicted to increase the heterogeneity and evolution of resistance in the remaining cells (13). A third type of promising
therapy is immunotherapy, which in many cases is used to treat
advanced cancers with high alteration rates. For certain cases,
this type of treatment should be the ﬁrst treatment and not the
last (14, 15). Developing optimized treatment protocols that
incorporate these three main treatment approaches to capture
the cancer dynamics features (such as the network structure with
its random and/or acquired dynamic changes) would be valuable tools. Here, we explore several underlying problems and
suggest approaches to overcome those obstacles.

For more than a decade, researchers have accepted the fact that
studying the various components of a system alone is not sufﬁcient to understand the complexity involved. A more holistic
system perspective has now been widely adopted for biology and
cancer research (1–4). Computational approaches that span
the ﬁelds of mathematics, statistics, computer science, and theoretical physics offer models to describe or to predict unknown
features of a system, as either data-driven or theory-driven methods (5–8). According to George E.P. Box, a British mathematician
and professor of statistics at the University of Wisconsin, "All
models are wrong, but some are useful" (9). This assessment is
especially relevant in cancer studies, due to the dynamic behavior
of such a quickly evolving and adapting system. To develop a
useful protocol that optimizes predictions about cancer treatments, an integrated approach that includes the strengths and
conclusions from various relevant disciplines should be
considered.
Choosing drugs for cancer therapy is a challenging task.
Several targeted drugs are currently available or have been tested
in clinical trials. Some drugs target a speciﬁc altered gene, such as
everolimus, which targets mammalian target of rapamycin
(mTOR). However, other drugs target several genes and pathways, such as sorafenib, which targets BRAF, FLT3, PDGFRB
tyrosine kinase, VEGFR2 tyrosine kinase, VEGFR3 tyrosine
kinase, and c-KIT tyrosine kinase. However, many cancer drugs
fail or underperform due to the evolving redundancy mechanisms related to their targeted genes or pathways (10, 11). In
addition, efﬁciently targeting pathways is problematic, because
it is unclear whether it is better to identify pathway targets by
level of expression or by their location in the pathway (e.g.,

The Underlying Problems
A robust cellular system
The cellular system has an amazing capacity to survive and
adapt to numerous extreme conditions, even in its normal state.
There are many examples of robust cellular behaviors involving
reversible or irreversible changes induced by different signals
(such as temperature shocks and amino acid starvation, ref. 16;
or by gene knockouts, refs. 17–19). However, one of the most
impressive complex behaviors of a cell can be seen in cancer,
where tumor cells survive through different resistance mechanisms given diverse treatments (20). In general, there are two key
homeostasis mechanisms by which even normal cells can robustly
regulate a perturbation or a stress signal: redundancy and a speciﬁc

Mechanisms of redundancy. Redundancy in biology is a problem known and considered for many years; however, it is essentially unsolved. Unfortunately,
this familiar problem is still at the core of many cancer-related open questions that must be addressed. Redundancy occurs at many levels, such
as at the genetic level (e.g., two TFs bind to a shared promoter), at the level of biochemical function (e.g., cross-talk among pathways composed of several
redundant interactions and variables), and at the level of biologic function (e.g., three different ways to efﬂux a drug from a cell). These different
levels have not previously been well enough deﬁned to be addressed, mainly due to the lack of data and an inadequate understanding of how
cancer cells compensate in each of these levels. Today, with advances in technology that enable the collection of different types of high-throughput
datasets from a patient and with new computational methods that have been designed to integrate "big-data" sets into a meaningful representation of
a patient's information, we have a good opportunity to make a renewed effort to ﬁnd creative ways to solve this fundamental problem.

dynamic structure that is constructed by feedback loops. Understanding these two systematic mechanisms is a critical step in
cancer study due to their fundamental functions as the central
system regulators. Both mechanisms are common to serve the
purpose of homeostasis mechanisms; however, the redundancy
(and compensation), in its global deﬁnition, is a more systematic
way to overcome perturbation problems, and thus will be the
subject of this perspective.
Redundancy as an evolutionary mechanism of robustness
The cellular system is a spatiotemporal nonlinear dynamic
system that has an underlying architecture guided by universal
principles. One such principle is that this system includes
redundant elements that can compensate for one another.
Redundancy has been widely addressed in cellular research
(21–27). In its global description, redundancy describes a
scenario in which different elements may potentially act in
the same biologic or dynamic manner, where the inhibition of
one of these elements has no signiﬁcant effect on the global
biologic outcome or on the system's dynamic behavior. Elements may refer to the fundamental variables or subsystems
that construct the system. The elements are redundant with
respect to a given function, and not necessarily concerning all of
their activities. The redundant elements can compensate for
one another either because they function simultaneously or act
as a backup mechanism that is activated only given a stress
signal. To maintain a regulated cellular system that functions
consistently despite routine noisy signals, the cellular system
must intrinsically include redundancy mechanisms at many
levels. It is clear that not all redundant elements act in the same
exact way, but they may compensate for one another to some

www.aacrjournals.org

extent, even at the cost of inaccuracy concerning timing or
concentration of their targets. However, to maintain its controlled growth in its normal setting, the cellular system also
includes key elements that can stop the cell cycle or, in certain
extreme cases, even initiate death, depending on the stress
intensity.
There are many examples of redundancy in biology, such as in
developmental biology (27, 28) and immunology (23). Redundancy occurs naturally at many cellular levels (Fig. 1). The most
studied level is the genetic level (24, 25). One example is when
two or more transcription factors (TF) share targeted genes, such
as E2F1-3. The E2F family regulates a wide range of cellular
processes, including DNA replication, mitosis, the function of
DNA damage checkpoints, DNA repair, differentiation, and
autophagy (29). It was shown that only the combined loss of
the E2F1-3 TFs eliminates the ability of mouse embryonic ﬁbroblasts to enter S phase (30). A second well-known level concerns
biologic function, where different elements participate in the
same pathway, with shared effects on the pathway. Experiments
in a mouse germline that perturbed all cyclins and cyclin-dependent kinases (Cdk) that govern the G1 phase of the cell cycle have
revealed that much of fetal development occurs normally in their
absence. Thus, most of these elements can be compensated for by
others, such as when Cdk2 compensates for Cdk4, 6, and 1, due to
their redundant functions in cell-cycle feedback loops (31). A
third level of redundancy concerns biochemical function, where at
least two elements share a common biochemical feature. For
instance, the multidrug transporters ABCB1, ABCC1, and ABCG2
share many substrates (32). Even elements from different genetic
families may share a biochemical feature, such as ABCG2 and
RLIP76 (33).

Cancer and drug resistance
Cancer cells are characterized by numerous alterations related to processes critical to their survival. These alterations
deregulate the cell-cycle checkpoints, growth, and apoptosis.
There are many mechanisms of drug resistance, through which
a cell avoids or overcomes a drug. Among them are decreased
drug uptake, increased drug efﬂux, activation of detoxifying
systems, activation of DNA repair mechanisms, evasion of
drug-induced apoptosis, etc. (20). Moreover, the heterogeneity
of cancer cells due to biologic redundancy mechanisms ensures
that many perturbed cells already have acquired resistance
before treatment. Treatments of advanced disease are largely
ineffective, mainly due to the lack of understanding of mechanisms responsible for the development of the cancer and the
basis of therapy-resistance mechanisms. Having a system that
can robustly function to promote survival despite the existence
of many redundant elements, with a dysfunctional cell-cycle
regulation mechanism, makes the development of multidrug
resistance in a cancer cell a very likely event.

New Methodologic Directions for Finding
Better Solutions
Given a mathematical description, one can reveal the therapyrelated redundancy mechanisms and uncover ways to overcome
those obstacles. Here, we explore several important issues, presenting open methodologic questions and challenges that, if
answered, would contribute to cellular studies, and speciﬁcally
to cancer research.

Emphasizing redundancy mechanisms in modeling
How can we systematically ﬁnd and characterize a redundant
element? In general, there are several computational and mathematical approaches to directly/indirectly address redundancy
mechanisms, given a speciﬁc dataset type, where each emphasizes
different aspects of the problem. Using those methods, one can
determine the redundancy level of an element, and ﬁnd the types
or circumstances of biologic elements that are more likely to be
redundant or that could develop redundancy. Moreover, natural
cell-to-cell variations occur among cells due to the redundant
elements. However, the cellular system includes regulatory
mechanisms to control these variations. Using these methods,
one can reveal the different types of regulation mechanisms that
limit these cellular differences in a population of cells. Here, we
mention three types of analysis and propose to expand the study
of redundancy mechanisms using these methods:
1. Networks and graph theory help to describe relationships
between every pair of components, where the components
could be genes, proteins, metabolites, etc. The relationships
could include physical interactions, correlations, mutual
information, etc. The network could be as complex as we need
it to be, e.g., a weighted multilayered network that describes
the ﬂow of information between genomic, proteomic,
metabolomic, etc. layers. Redundancy in a network, for
instance, can be expressed by the redundant paths that start at
one node and end at another, by the redundant nodes in a
process that are part of several layers in a multilayered
network, by redundant feedback loops or even redundant
modules (34). The main strength in this description is the
ability to study the global and local properties of a network, to

810 Cancer Res; 75(5) March 1, 2015

reveal the redundant components, and to study their impact
on those network properties.
2. Any spatiotemporal process can also be described by dynamic
system theory, e.g., by a system of differential equations,
where its elements change as a function of time and space. The
dynamics of a very complex system, such as the cell cycle, can
include many redundant feedback loops or even redundant
dynamic subsystems that act on the same variable (35). The
major strength in such a modeling approach is to deﬁne the
global dynamic structure of the system based on its dynamic
subsystems, and to understand the dynamic signiﬁcance of
each redundant component. A component could be a
subsystem, not just a speciﬁc variable, depending on the level
of simplicity.
3. Redundancy is also hidden in multiple data sources. There are
many computational methods (mainly, machine learning
techniques) that reformulate the system's high
dimensionality such that all of its elements can be
mathematically described by fewer essential elements. For
instance, a commonly used linear method is principal
component analysis.
Current advances in whole-genome sequencing and other
"omics" technologies, along with the developments of many new
computational and statistical integration methods, have resulted
in some success in translating cancer "omics" data into therapeutics and diagnostics (36–38). Clearly, the integration of different
data types that incorporate redundancy mechanisms should
be included in the design of new experimental, computational,
and mathematical models to have a better description of the
various systems that contribute to cancer evolution, progression,
and survival.
How can one predict an effective combination therapy in an evolving
system? An important concept in combination therapy is drug
synergy (39–41). One of the most common deﬁnitions of drug
synergy is that the effects of several drugs in combination are
greater than those of a single drug. Although, in general,
synergy is difﬁcult to predict, predicting synergy in drugresistant cells adds another level of complexity to cancer
modeling. In drug-resistant cells, synergy not only is a function of the connectivity in known static cellular networks but
also includes the evolution of new cross-talk that forms an
evolving resistance network based on the alteration rate of
those cells. The robustness characteristic of such a network
could be based on the degree of redundancy. Redundant
elements compensate for mutated or targeted genes and may
create new gene/pathway cross-talk that gives a cancer cell the
ability to overcome the effects of treatment. Given the robust
survival mechanisms of a cell, and the known mechanisms of
multidrug resistance, what would be a better approach to
predict an efﬁcient combination therapy? Most system-level
studies on this issue have focused on developing methods to
maximize the damage in the cancer-cell network, mainly by
studying the network topology and dynamics, neglecting the
impact of evolving redundancy mechanisms and their relation
to cancer progression and resistance development (42, 43).
Therapeutic strategies that can be applied to minimize the
effectiveness of evolving redundancy mechanisms should
yield better survival outcomes.
In addition, intratumoral heterogeneity increases the complexity of the cancer problem. Intratumoral heterogeneity refers to

Redundancy: A Critical Obstacle to Improving Cancer Therapy

genetic and nongenetic differences between cancer cells originating within the same tumor. In many cases, cells with different
alterations can achieve the same drug sensitivities and cellular
rates. Thus, an open question is how to reduce cell-to-cell variations in a way that includes information about alterations that
have a direct impact on the resistance level, cancer dynamics, and
survival of a cell. This type of study can include the effects of the
development of redundancy mechanisms and deepen our understanding by studying the roles of different mutations/epimutations in the evolving redundancy mechanisms. Methods that aim
to predict the effectiveness of combination therapies must include
some evolutionary and dynamic features that would change the
static view that we currently hold.
Can functional importance of an element be correlated to redundancy level in cancer cells? Interesting evolutionary theories (mainly between species) related to redundancy mechanisms have been
proposed. For example, genetic redundancy, on the one hand,
might be considered as suppressing evolvability, but, on the other
hand, it also promotes adaptation by allowing duplicated genes to
evolve distinct functions (44). If an element is known to be
redundant, does that imply biologic importance? Studies of
Escherichia coli and yeast reveal opposite relationships between
the functional importance and redundancy level of a reaction in a
metabolic network, concluding that redundant reactions in their
network are probably not kept as backups (22, 45). A study of the
plasticity of genetic interactions in metabolic networks of yeast
also supported this view, and concluded that functional redundancy offers a uniﬁed framework for the evolution of environmental adaptation and mutational robustness (26). All of these
studies were performed on metabolic networks of noncancer
cells, with speciﬁc biologic and computational assumptions and
limitations, where the "importance" was mainly reﬂected by the
level of the network connectivity. As mentioned above, there are
different system descriptions that are possible to model a cellular
process (e.g., dynamical system), to deﬁne redundancy level (e.g.,
genetic, biologic function, or biochemical function), and to
estimate the importance of an element in that system. Speciﬁcally
concerning cancer cells, the functional importance of a protein
could also be deﬁned by its different contributions to the cellular
network structure and to the system dynamics in a cancer cell at

different levels of resistance, or in a cell at different stages of cancer
progression. Thus, an open question remains, if "importance"
refers to the element's contribution to cancer progression or
evolution, can functional importance of an element be correlated
to redundancy level?

Conclusions
One of the greatest challenges in studying the biology of cancer
and in formulating an effective treatment for cancer is not just
acknowledging the disease heterogeneity, but also evaluating and
predicting rapid changes to different heterogeneous distributions
over time and space. The cancer research community has already
taken initial steps toward interdisciplinary research, yet the
remaining gaps between the disciplines call for a revolutionary
rethinking of the approach. Several computational approaches
can be applied to describe and to quantify biologic regulations,
heterogeneity, redundancy, drug resistance, and functional
importance. It would be useful to deﬁne and study each of these
terms based on their contribution to the tumor network structure,
in addition to the system dynamics that includes the cellular rates.
Moreover, treatment protocols that schedule and optimize combinations of different treatment approaches (e.g., targeted drugs,
chemotherapy, immunotherapy, radiotherapy) as a holistic personalized approach based on the evolving tumor dynamics features, would potentially lead to better responses in the clinic.
