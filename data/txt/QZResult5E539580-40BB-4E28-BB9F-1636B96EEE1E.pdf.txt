ABSTRACT
Liposarcoma is one of the most common histologic types of soft tissue sarcoma
and is frequently an aggressive cancer with poor outcome. Hence, alternative
approaches other than surgical excision are necessary to improve treatment of welldifferentiated/dedifferentiated liposarcoma (WDLPS/DDLPS).
For this reason, we performed a two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE) and
matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry/mass
spectrometry (MALDI-TOF/MS) analysis to identify new factors for WDLPS andÂ DDLPS.
Among the selected candidate proteins, gankyrin, known to be an oncoprotein, showed
a significantly high level of expression pattern and inversely low expression of p53/
p21 in WDLPS and DDLPS tissues, suggesting possible utility as a new predictive
factor. Moreover, inhibition of gankyrin not only led to reduction of in vitro cell growth
ability including cell proliferation, colony-formation, and migration, but also in vivo
DDLPS cell tumorigenesis, perhaps via downregulation of the p53 tumor suppressor
gene and its p21 target and also reduction of AKT/mTOR signal activation. This study
identifies gankyrin, for the first time, as new potential predictive and oncogenic factor
of WDLPS and DDLPS, suggesting the potential for service as a future LPS therapeutic
approach.

INTRODUCTION

the following three categories: atypical lipomatous
tumor or well differentiated LPS (ATL-WDLPS LPS) /
dedifferentiated LPS (DDLPS), myxoid/round cell LPS
and pleomorphic LPS [2] based on clinicopathological
and molecular genetic characteristics. Both WDLPS and

Liposarcoma (LPS) is the most common soft
tissue sarcoma subtype and accounts for at least 20 %
of all sarcomas in adults [1]. LPS can be subtyped into

expression in DDLPS cell lines. Our data using in vitro
proliferation, colony formation, and migration, as well as
in vivo tumor cell proliferation and tumorigenesis assays,
suggest the importance of gankyrin. These results support
the possibility that gankyrin is a possible molecular
therapeutic target for the treatment of WDLPS and
DDLPS patients.

DDLPS are characterized as containing ring-shaped or
giant-rod chromosomes with amplified 12q13-q21 regions
[3, 4]. The mouse double minute 2 (MDM2) gene is the
most frequently amplified gene in WD/DDLPS (almost
100 % incidence). The cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (CDK4)
gene is amplified in more than 90 % of cases. MDM2 and
CDK4 are useful factors in the differential diagnosis of
WDLPS and DDLPS [5, 6]. However, amplification and
overexpression of MDM2 and CDK4 does not distinguish
WDLPS from DDLPS [7]. Moreover, DDLPS is a
biphasic neoplasm in which one component is WDLPS
and the other component is a non-lipogenic sarcoma of
varying histological grade. This histological subtype
behaves more aggressively than WDLPS and has an
estimated 5-year disease-specific survival of 44 %, which
is less than the 93 % for WDLPS [8]. The local recurrence
rate for retroperitoneal DDLPS tumors reaches 80~90 %
in most series and distant metastatic relapse is observed in
up to 30 % of cases [9, 10]. Therefore, although MDM2
and CDK4 appear to share a common genetic background,
the etiologies of WDLPS and DDLPS are unclear and may
be different.
Gankyrin (also called PSMD10) protein (hereafter
gankyrin) consists of 7 ankyrin repeat domains and was
initially identified as a component of the 26S proteasome
[11]. Gankyrin can interact with various proteins, such as
MDM2, CDK4, retinoblastoma protein (pRb), NF-kB,
and RhoGDI [11-15]. Therefore, through these proteinprotein interactions, gankyrin enhances cell proliferation,
cell cycle progression and anti-apoptotic activity [16-18].
Gankyrin also appears to function as an oncoprotein at
high protein levels [12, 13]. Gankyrin is expressed at high
levels in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) compared to in
normal hepatic tissue [19], which suggests that gankyrin
may have an important role in the early stages of human
hepatocarcinogenesis [20]. Although these reports suggest
the importance of gankyrin in cell proliferation and
tumorigenesis, the precise molecular function of gankyrin
in liposarcomagenesis remains unknown.
Previous studies using gene expression profiling
in liposarcoma have focused on comparing liposarcoma
subtypes with normal adipose tissue [21, 22], usually
without a comparative analysis of WDLPS and
DDLPS protein levels in their respective progression
and dedifferentiation signatures. Herein, we utilized a
proteome analysis approach incorporating 2-dimensional
electrophoresis (2-DE) to identify new factor for WDLPS
and DDLPS. This approach demonstrated that gankyrin
expression was observed in WDLPS and DDLPS and it
was higher in DDLPS than in WDLPS tissues, suggesting
that gankyrin may serve as a specific molecular signature
for WDLPS and DDLPS. We also found that p53 and p21
were significantly downregulated in DDLPS tissues in
concordance with gankyrin protein expression. Moreover,
downstream signaling through Akt/mTOR activation was
also significantly decreased by inhibition of gankyrin

RESULTS
Comparison of well-differentiated liposarcoma
(WDLPS) and dedifferentiated liposarcoma
(DDLPS)
Fourteen LPS surgical specimens were prepared for
proteome analysis. The clinical characteristics of the LPS
patients are shown in supplemental table 1 (10 male and
4 female patients; average age of 54.2 years). The LPS
subtypes in this proteome analysis consisted of WDLPS
(n=4), DDLPS (n=4), and DDLPS containing WDLPS
components (WD/DDLPS; n=6). The histological features
of the LPS samples were confirmed with H&E staining,
LPS marker expression (MDM2/CDK4), and MDM2FISH analysis (Fig. 1A) prior to proteomic analysis. Twodimensional electrophoresis (2-DE) analysis with WD/
DDLPS samples (Fig. 1B) was used to compare protein
expression levels in WDLPS and DDLPS. A total of 10
protein spots were selected from the 2-DE results based
on the relative intergroup expression levels. There were 5
protein spots up-regulated in both WDLPS (spot numbers
1~5) and in DDLPS (spot numbers 6~10) (Fig. 1B). To
identify the expressed proteins, the selected spots were
analyzed by MALDI-TOF-MS. The spots were identified
based on the sequence coverage, and each protein spot was
given a suggested gene name (Table 1). The five protein
spots that were increased in WDLPS were identified as
vimentin, ATP synthase subunit beta (ATP5B), isoform 1
of heat shock cognate 71 kDa protein (HSPA8), isoform
1 of polymerase I and transcript release factor (PTRF),
and annexin A2 isoform 1 (ANXA2). The five upregulated
proteins in DDLPS were identified as Desmin, isoform
gamma-B of fibrinogen gamma chain (FGG), myosin
light chain 3 (MYL3), apolipoprotein A-I (APOA1) and
PSMD10 26S proteasome non-ATPase regulatory subunit
10 (Gankyrin). These results suggest that LPS subtypes
exhibit different patterns of protein expression at various
differentiation stages. Therefore, different protein pools
may play important and distinct roles in LPS biological
functions.

Dominent expression of gankyrin protein in
dedifferentiated liposarcoma (DDLPS)

DDLPS (Fig. 2C). The expression of p21, which is a
direct downstream target of p53, was consistent with
p53 expression (Fig. 2C). Gankyrin expression was then
evaluated by immunohistochemistry in WDLPS and
DDLPS specimens. As shown in figure 2D, gankyrin
expression was positive in the nucleus and cytoplasm of
DDLPS tissues but was negative in normal adipose tissue
(AT) and WDLPS tissue. This result was also consistent
with the gankyrin expression level determined by western
blot analysis. These results suggest that gankyrin might
be a dominant protein for DDLPS. Additionally, gankyrin
expression may be related to p53 regulation in DDLPS.

To determine the specific expression of candidate
proteins in LPS tissues, we tested the expression levels
of these proteins in the WDLPS and DDLPS components
of WD/DDLPS specimens (n=5). We found that gankyrin
was significantly upregulated in the DDLPS component of
WD/DDLPS specimens at both the RNA level (Fig. 2A)
and protein level (Fig. 2B). Furthermore, the upregulation
of gankyrin was detected in WDLPS (n=4) and DDLPS
(n=4) specimens (Fig. 2C). Gankyrin is known to regulate
the degradation of p53 and to function as a proto-oncogene
in hepatocellular carcinoma through interaction with
MDM2. Therefore, the expression levels of MDM2,
CDK4, p53 and p21 proteins were investigated to confirm
whether gankyrin regulated p53 in WDLPS and DDLPS
tissues. Although most LPS samples exhibited high
levels of MDM2 and CDK4 expression, the variation
of MDM2 and CDK4 protein levels in WDLPS and
DDLPS were not significantly different. However, the
protein level of p53 was significantly higher in WDLPS
than in DDLPS and exhibited an inverse correlation
with the expression of gankyrin in both WDLPS and

Association between gankyrin expression and
patient prognosis
We next determined whether gankyrin expression
was associated with WDLPS and DDLPS patient
recurrence, metastasis and survival. Tissue microarrays
(TMA) of WDLPS (n=123) and DDLPS (n=81) were
prepared from 204 patient specimens and then examined
by gankyrin immunostaining. Gankyrin expression levels
were divided into four scoring grades (score 0 ~ 3), and
the 204 LPS samples were divided into two groups: low-

score (score 0-1) and high-score (score 2-3; Fig. 3A).
Basal gankyrin expression was significantly higher in
WDLPS and DDLPS (197 of 204 samples > score 0) than
in normal adipose tissue. The proportion of high-score
DDLPS (84.0 %) was also higher than that of WDLPS
(50.4 %; P<0.001, Table 2). The high expression levels of
gankyrin correlate with the likelihood of either recurrence
(P=0.001) or metastasis (P=0.009, Table 2) of WDLPS and
DDLPS. Moreover, although the prognostic significance
of gankyrin is not easily derived in the DDLPS samples
when overall survival of WDLPS and DDLPS patients
were analyzed separately (Supplemental Fig. 2), KaplanMeier analysis revealed that WDLPS and DDLPS patients
in the gankyrin high-score group exhibited significantly
shorter survival rates than those of patients in the lowscore group (p < 0.001, Fig. 3B). These results suggest
that gankyrin expression is useful for determining the
clinicopathological characteristics of WDLPS and
DDLPS.

Additionally, p53 and p21 were significantly increased by
the inhibition of gankyrin expression and showed a pattern
similar to that observed in DDLPS tissues (Fig. 2C).
These data suggest that a major function of gankyrin may
be to downregulate p53 via MDM2. Moreover, as might
be anticipated by the inhibition of gankyrin expression,
activated forms of AKT and mTOR (p-AKT and p-mTOR)
were decreased. The phosphorylated form of p70S6k1, an
mTOR downstream target involved with cell proliferation,
was also diminished by shGankyrin expression in DDLPS
cell lines (Fig. 4F). Taken together, these observations
support the possibility that highly expressed gankyrin
protein may participate in regulating the inhibition of p53
and AKT/m-TOR activation in DDLPS.

Gankyrin
inhibition
reduces
tumorigenesis of LPS cells in vivo

To elucidate the role of gankyrin in DDLPS
tumorigenesis in vivo, we established a local xenograft
tumorigenesis model in immunodeficient NSG mice. The
LPS246 and SW872 DDLPS cell lines with shControl
and shGankyrin were used as tumorigenesis models.
Although the tumorigenesis ability of DDLPS cell lines
varied, in vivo tumorigenesis in the shControl (shControl
#2) and shGankyrin groups (shGankyrin #4) showed
significantly decreased tumor size (Fig. 5 A and D),
volume (Fig. 5 B and E) and weight (Fig. 5 C and F).
Furthermore, the results of the H&E and IHC staining
demonstrated that gankyrin expression in xenograft tissues
was properly visualized in the shControl and shGankyrin
groups (Fig. 5 G and H). Ki-67 expression is indicative
of tumor cell proliferation and revealed a positive
correlation with gankyrin expression in each xenograft
tissue sample. Taken together, these results suggest a
functional significance for gankyrin expression in DDLPS
tumorigenesis in vivo.

Effect of gankyrin inhibition on the proliferation
of LPS cell lines
The molecular role of gankyrin has been previously
reported in several types of cancers, especially HCC [15,
24, 25]. Because the biological role of gankyrin in DDLPS
has not been previously reported, we evaluated gankyrin
expression in the LPS246 and SW872 DDLPS cell lines.
Consistent with the results obtained from DDLPS tissue,
gankyrin was highly expressed in all DDLPS cell lines
compared with the U2OS and MG63 osteosarcoma cell
lines (Fig. 4A). We established endogenous gankyrinsilencing in each DDLPS cell line using the lentiviral
shRNA system (Fig. 4B). The inhibitory role of gankyrin
expression was confirmed at both the mRNA and protein
levels, and its functional significance was also validated
by colony forming unit (CFU) assays (Supplemental
Fig. 1). Both LPS246 and SW872 DDLPS cell lines
had significantly decreased cell proliferation, colony
formation and migration ability following downregulation
of gankyrin expression (Fig. 4 C and D). These results
suggested that gankyrin may play an important role in
promoting DDLPS cellular proliferation in vitro.

DISCUSSION
LPS is the most abundant soft tissue sarcoma. Due
to the low incidence of soft tissue sarcoma, only a few
studies have identified robust target for optimal treatment
strategies in this disease [10, 26-29]. Genetically, WD/
DDLPS and pleomorphic LPS have varying degrees
of chromosomal instability with heterogeneous and
complex karyotypes [4, 30]. Most karyotypically
complex liposarcomas have amplification of the 12q14
chromosome region that includes MDM2 and CDK4 gene
[6, 7]. It was previously reported that MDM2 and CDK4
inhibition decreases the proliferation of LPS cell lines
in vitro [31], and targeting these proteins are an ongoing
clinical research strategy [32]. Moreover, because WDLPS
and DDLPS respond modestly to systemic chemotherapy
[33], the need to identify novel molecular targets for LPS

Functional target of gankyrin in DDLPS cells
After evaluating the inhibitory effect of gankyrin
expression in DDLPS cell lines, immunoblot assays
were performed to identify the signaling modules that
affect cell proliferation, colony formation and migration.
The expression of MDM2 and CDK4 were tested
after gankyrin inhibition. Although both proteins bind
gankyrin, after gankyrin inhibition, the expression levels
of MDM2 and gankyrin were markedly reduced, whereas
the expression of CDK4 was not changed (Fig. 4E).

therapy is critical. Several groups have performed tissue
microarray and genomic analyses in an attempt to identify
aberrantly regulated genes important to LPS generation.
These genes include ZIC1, TOP2A, and AURKA, which
have high expression levels across the liposarcoma
spectrum [21-23]. Although DDLPS is more aggressive
and has higher rates of metastasis and recurrence than
WDLPS [34], both diseases have very similar cytogenetic
features.
In this study, we examined the gankyrin expression
level (Fig. 2) of 14 WD and/or DDLPS tissues (Table
1) after 2-DE and MALDI-TOF analysis. As shown in
Figure 2, gankyrin is highly expressed in DDLPS and
DDLPS sub-components at the mRNA and protein levels.

However, the gankyrin expression levels in the WDLPS
component of WD/DDLPS specimens (Fig. 2B) were
slightly higher than those in WDLPS tissues (Fig. 2C,
gankyrin IB). Accordingly, the WDLPS and DDLPS
sub-components of WD/DDLPS specimens were usually
physically separated after surgical resection when the LPS
tissues were prepared for subsequent analysis (Fig. 1A).
The imprecise identification of WDLPS and DDLPS subcomponents during surgical excision may have contributed
to some ambiguity in the separation of WDLPS and
DDLPS. Moreover, other reports have demonstrated that
the WDLPS sub-component of WD/DDLPS is molecularly
similar to the DDLPS fraction of the tumor and that it may
only be distinguished from pure WDLPS via CGH array,

gene expression profiling, and similar molecular strategies
[35, 36]. For this reason, the detection of additional protein
expression levels related to gankyrin was performed using
pure WDLPS and DDLPS tissues rather than WD/DDLPS
specimens (Fig. 2C).
It is already known that p53 and Rb communicate
via crosstalk pathways. Thus, we investigated the
role of gankyrin and its possible relationship to these
tumor suppressor molecules that impact cancer cell
proliferation and survival. It is known that gankyrin
expression is associated with the regulation of p53 and
Rb in HCC [13]. However, it has also been reported
that gankyrin positively regulates Î²-catenin signaling
independent of p53 in HCC cell lines [37]. Moreover, in
osteosarcoma cell lines, the knockdown of Rb enhances
p53 destabilization in a gankyrin-dependent manner [12].
We observed that p53 and p21 were inversely correlated
with gankyrin expression in WDLPS and DDLPS tissues.
However, the expression of CDK4 as an LPS marker
protein appears to be unrelated to gankyrin expression
(Fig. 2C). Furthermore, Rb was not universally detected
in our panel of WDLPS and DDLPS tissues (data not
shown). This finding suggests that gankyrin expression
corresponds strongly to p53 but not Rb expression in
WDLPS and DDLPS tissues. Previous studies have shown
that the downregulation of gankyrin induced apoptosis in
HCC cells bearing wild-type p53 [12] and that p53 gene
mutation is important in a variety of human cancers [3840]. We also examined mutations of the p53 gene (Exon
2~11) in 14 LPS tissues using genomic DNA sequencing.
Although the number of LPS tissues examined was not
sufficient to reach definitive conclusions, no mutations of
p53 were found in our 14 LPS tissues (data not shown).
Gankyrin expression levels have been positively
associated with metastatic potential and are negatively
associated with patient overall survival in hepatocellular
carcinoma, esophageal squamous cell carcinoma,
gastric cancer and colorectal cancer [19, 24, 25, 41].
However, to date, there have been no reports on the
function of gankyrin in LPS. We verified that gankyrin
overexpression correlated with tumor location, recurrence,
metastasis (p=0.008, p=0.001 and p=0.009, respectively;
Table 2) and overall survival (p<0.001; Fig. 3B) using
immunohistochemical staining of gankyrin in a TMA of
patient-derived WDLPS and DDLPS tissues (n=204; Fig.
3A). When we separately analyzed the overall survival of
WDLPS and DDLPS based on gankyrin expression levels
(Supplemental Fig. 2), gankyrin did not predict overall
survival in the DDLPS samples (p-value = 0.782), whereas
it predicted a slightly increased overall survival in WDLPS
samples (p-value = 0.047). These results demonstrated
that no significant prognosis in terms of overall survival
in DDLPS in contrast with WDLPS. Additionally, these
results suggest that a simple evaluation of gankyrin may
not allow for an accurate prediction in the prognosis
of LPS patients. However, although the prognostic
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

significance of gankyrin is not easily verified in the
DDLPS samples, these results demonstrated that gankyrin
expression is useful indicator for the clinicopathological
characteristics of WDLPS and DDLPS.
In HCC, the serine-threonine kinase Akt
is considered a key factor in tumor survival and
angiogenesis [42, 43]. Moreover, gankyrin may have a
protective function in ER-stress-induced cell apoptosis
via AKT phosphorylation and may contribute to HCC
invasiveness and metastasis[18, 44]. Although aberrant
Akt activation is a factor underlying leiomyosarcoma
and WDLPS proliferation and tumorigenesis [45, 46],
the role of gankyrin-mediated Akt signaling in LPS
remains uncertain. We performed knockdown of gankyrin
expression using a shDNA-expressing lentiviral system
(Supplemental Fig. 1) based on previous reports in other
cancers [24, 41, 44] to elucidate gankyrin functional affects
in DDLPS cell lines. In the DDLPS cell lines LPS246 and
SW872, gankyrin expression was greatly inhibited by
shGankyrin viral infection (Fig. 4B). Using the LPS246
cells, we found that the levels of p-Akt, p-mTOR and
p70S6K1 were reduced in gankyrin knockdown cell
lines after confirmation of gankyrin, p53, p21, MDM2,
and CDK4 expression. Moreover, gankyrin knockdown
led to a reduction in cell proliferation, colony formation,
and cell migration ability in vitro (Fig. 4 C and D) and
reduced tumor formation in vivo (LPS 246: 017~03.45
g vs. 2.01~3.99 g, 120~455 mm3 vs. 2000~5115 mm3;
SW872: 0.01~0.016 g vs. 0.12~0.35 g, 1~9.37 mm3 vs.
48~200 mm3; Fig. 5). These results strongly support the
possibility that gankyrin may be an important oncogene
in DDLPS.
In conclusion, we have demonstrated that gankyrin
is dominantly expressed in DDLPS. Furthermore, high
levels of gankyrin may positively correlate with the
oncogenesis of liposarcoma and might be useful as a
potential clinical predictive factor in WDLPS and DDLPS.
Although further studies are needed to elucidate the
mechanism(s) of gankyrin in LPS regulatory processes,
these investigations suggest that gankyrin might also serve
as a novel therapeutic target for WDLPS and DDLPS
treatment.

Fourteen patients who were diagnosed with
WDLPS, DDLPS and WD/DDLPS and treated at
Samsung Medical Center between September 2009 and
May 2011 were evaluated for this study. Informed consent
was obtained from all patients. The project was approved
by the Samsung Medical Center institutional review board
(Seoul, Korea). LPS and normal adipose tissues were

for 15 min. Vertical SDS-PAGE was run with laboratorymade homogenous 10 % acrylamide gels in an Ettan
DALTII apparatus (Amersham Biosciences). The gels
were stained with coomassie blue, and image analysis was
performed using the Image Master 2-D Platinum software
(Amersham Biosciences) according to the protocols
provided by the manufacturer.

Tissue microarray (TMA)
TMAs containing 204 human WDLPS and DDLPS
tissues were prepared. TMA construction and clinical
information were approved by the University of Texas
MD Anderson Cancer Center (UTMDACC) IRB. Tissue
sections 5 Âµm thick were cut from TMA blocks and used
for immunohistochemical staining. The quantitative
analysis of LPS samples was conducted by assigning a
score depending on the overall gankyrin staining intensity
(0: no staining, 1: low intensity, 2: moderate intensity, 3:
high intensity). The staining scores were assigned by a soft
tissue pathologist (Alexander J Lazar).

Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time
of flight mass spectrometry/mass spectrometry
The protein spots of interest were excised manually
from the preparative gels, destained in 50 mM NH4HCO3/
acetonitrile (50:50) and dried by vacuum centrifugation.
To rehydrate the tissues, the gel pieces were incubated
in 100 mM ammonium bicarbonate and 10 mM DTT
for 1 h at 56Â°C. Alkylation was performed in 100 mM
ammonium bicarbonate and 55 mM iodoacetamide for 40
min at room temperature in the dark. After dehydration
in acetonitrile, the gel pieces were dried and digested
with sequencing grade trypsin (enzyme:substrate (w/w)
ratio > 1:20) (Promega) at 37Â°C overnight in 50 mM
ammonium bicarbonate. After a repeated process of
hydrationâdehydration and sonication, the resulting
tryptic peptides were dissolved in 0.5 % trifluoroacetic
acid (TFA) solution. The peptides were then desalted
using a ZipTipC18 (Millipore) tip. The peptides were
eluted directly onto the MALDI target with an Î±-cyano-4hydroxy-cinnamic acid (CHCA) matrix solution (10 mg/
ml CHCA in 0.5 % TFA/50 % acetonitrile (1:1, v/v). All
mass spectra were acquired in reflection mode by a 4700
Proteomics Analyzer (Applied Biosystems).

Histological and immunohistochemical (IHC)
staining
Formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded tissues
were stained with hematoxylin and eosin for histological
observation and analyzed by IHC staining. Briefly, heatinduced antigen retrieval was performed using 0.01 M
sodium citrate buffer in a microwave for 15 minutes.
After quenching of endogenous peroxidase and blocking
in 3 % goat serum, the tissues were incubated with
primary polyclonal anti-gankyrin antibody (Santa Cruz
Biotechnology), anti-Mdm2, anti-CDK4 (Invitrogen) and
anti-Ki-67 (Dako). After three TBST washes followed by
secondary antibody, peroxidase activity was detected with
32-diaminobenzidine-tetrahydrochloride (DAB, Dako).
Negative and positive controls were used to establish the
specificity of these reactions.

Cell culture
HEK293T (human embryonic kidney 293T) cells,
SW872 (DDLPS cells), U2OS and MG63 (osteosarcoma
cells) were purchased from the American Type Culture
Collection. Human DDLPS cell lines LPS246 and
primary LPS cells were isolated and cultured as previously
described. The cells were then used for FISH analysis
[23]. The cells were maintained in DMEM-high glucose
media with 10 % fetal bovine serum (FBS), 100 units/
ml penicillin plus 100 Î¼g/ml streptomycin (1X P/S) and
incubated at 37 Â°C in 5 % CO2.

2-Dimensional gel electrophoresis and image
analysis
LPS tissues were resuspended in lysis buffer (8 M
urea, CHAPS, 0.5 % IPG buffer pH 3-10), and disrupted
using an ultrasonicator before centrifugation. The protein
separation was performed in duplicate for each sample.
For each sample, 1 mg of protein was loaded on an IPG
strip (18 cm, pH 3â10 nonlinear) that was rehydrated
overnight. Isoelectric focusing (IEF) was performed using
the following parameters with the Multiphor II system
(Amersham Biosciences): 500 V for 1 h, 1000 V for 1 h,
5000 V for 1 h, 8000 V (gradient) for 1 h, and finally, 8000
V for a total of 45 kV h. After IEF, the IPG strips were
immediately equilibrated in 10 ml equilibration solutions
(50 mM TrisâHCl, pH 8.8, 6 M urea, 30 % glycerol, 2
% SDS, 0.002 % bromophenol blue) with gentle shaking

MDM2 FISH analysis
FISH was performed with cells isolated from WD/
DDLPS tissue using a MDM2 probe (Kreatech) that was
specific for the centromere region of chromosome 12q15.
Briefly, 10 Î¼l of probe or probe-mix per 22 x 22 mm was
applied to the field to fix the cells. The cells were covered
by a glass cover slip and sealed with Fixogum or Rubber

Center. The sample was denatured and probed on a hot
plate at 75Â°C for 5~10 min. The cells were incubated
overnight at 37Â°C in a humidified chamber. The slides
were washed in 1x wash buffer (2x SSC/0.1 % Igepal)
at room temperature and dehydrated in 70 %, 85 % and
100 % ethanol for 1 min each. After air drying at room
temperature, 15 Î¼l of DAPI counterstain (LK-095A) was
applied and the preparations were covered with a glass
cover slip. Microscopy was performed, and 200 nuclei per
slide were counted.

Total RNA was extracted from LPS tissues with
Trizol reagent (Invitrogen). cDNA was synthesized
with superscript III and oligo(dT) (Invitrogen)
according to the manufacturerâs instructions. PCR
products were normalized using Î²-actin amplification.
The primer sequences and expected sizes are shown
below. The human gankyrin forward primer was 5âGCAACTTGGAGTGCCAGTGAA - 3â, and the reverse
primer was 5â- TCACTTGAGCACCTTTTCCCA - 3â, and
generated a product of 198 bp. The human Î²-actin forward
primer was 5â-CTACGTCGCCCTGGACTTCGAGC
3â,
and
the
reverse
primer
was
5â-GATGGAGCCGCCGATCCACACGG - 3â, and
generated a 420 bp product. PCR amplifications were
performed as follows: 30 cycles of 60 s at 94 Â°C, 60 s at
55 Â°C and 60 s at 72 Â°C. The PCR products were analyzed
in 1 % agarose gel.

Gene knockdown by shRNA lentivirus
Lentivirus plasmid vectors pLKO.1-puro and
pLKO.1-puro containing MISSION shRNA targeting
gankyrin (shGankyrin) or non-targeting shRNAs
(shControl) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Five
distinct sequences per gene were assessed for knockdown
(clone #0: TRCN0000290090, #1: TRCN0000290021,
#4: TRCN0000058074, #5: TRCN0000058075, #7:
TRCN0000058077). The shControl sequence is not
known to target any human genes (SHC002) and served
as a negative control. The infectious viral supernatants
were collected in viral harvest medium 24 hours after
transfection. To knockdown gene expression, the cells
were infected with lentivirus using 8 Î¼g/ml polybrene
(Sigma-Aldrich) to increase infection efficiency. The
infected cells were selected with 1.5~3.0 Î¼g/ml puromycin
(Sigma-Aldrich). Gankyrin knockdown was measured by
RT-PCR and immunoblot assays.

Immunoblot assay
Immunoblot assays were performed using standard
methods. Briefly, total protein (10~25 Î¼g) from LPS
tissues and cells was separated by SDS-PAGE and
transferred onto PVDF membranes. The membranes were
blocked with 5 % nonfat dried milk or 5 % BSA and then
blotted with relevant primary antibodies. HRP-conjugated
secondary antibodies were detected using an enhanced
chemiluminescence (ECL) kit (Ab Frontier). The
antibodies used in these studies are as follows: Gankyrin,
p53, p21 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), Mdm2 (Invitrogen),
CDK4 (Invitrogen), PI3K, AKT, phospho-AKT, m-TOR,
phospho-m-TOR, p70S6 Kinase, phospho-p70S6 Kinase
(Cell signaling), and Î²-actin (Sigma).

Colony formation and cell proliferation assay
To examine colony formation, 500 cells per well
were plated into 6-well plates and grown in DMEM-high
glucose medium for 10 days. The cells were then stained
with 0.5 % crystal violet solution for 30 min at room
temperature. Pictures were digitally captured, and the
number of colonies was counted. Cell proliferation was
counted every day after seeding cells (5x104) for 4 days.

Establishment of an in vivo tumorigenesis mouse
model
LPS246 (2Ã106) and SW872 (1Ã107) cells were
subcutaneously injected into 6-week-old NSG mice
(each n=10). The mice were sacrificed 6~8 weeks after
implantation. Xenograft explants of tumor tissues were
confirmed by histological and immunohistochemical
staining.

Migration assay
Polycarbonate filters with 8-Î¼m pores (Becton
Dickinson Labware) in 24-well tissue culture plates
were used for modified Boyden chamber migration
assays. The lower chamber compartments contained
DMEM supplemented with 1 % fetal bovine serum as
a chemoattractant. The cells (5x104) were seeded in the
upper well and incubated at 37 Â°C. After incubation, filters
were fixed with acetic acid and stained with 0.2 % crystal
violet. The absorbance was measured at 650 nm with a
microplate reader (Molecular Devices Corporation).

Statistical Analysis
The chi-squared test or the Fisherâs exact test was
used to compare categorical variables. The survival rates
were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method, and
the survival curves were compared using log-rank tests.
Statistical analyses were performed with PASW Statistics
18 software (IBM Corporation, Armonk, NY).
