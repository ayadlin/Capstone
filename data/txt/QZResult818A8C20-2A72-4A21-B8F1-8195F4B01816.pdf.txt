Abstract
Preexisting and acquired resistance to epidermal growth factor
receptor (EGFR) inhibitors limits their clinical usefulness in
patients with advanced non–small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).
This study characterizes the efficacy and mechanisms of the
combination of gefitinib or erlotinib with OSU-03012, a
celecoxib-derived antitumor agent, to overcome EGFR inhibitor resistance in three NSCLC cell lines, H1155, H23, and A549.
The OSU-03012/EGFR inhibitor combination induced pronounced apoptosis in H1155 and H23 cells, but not in A549
cells, suggesting a correlation between drug sensitivity and
basal phospho-Akt levels independently of EGFR expression
status. Evidence indicates that this combination facilitates
apoptosis through both Akt signaling inhibition and upregulation of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress–induced,
GADD153-mediated pathways. For example, ectopic expression
of constitutively active Akt significantly attenuated the
inhibitory effect on cell survival, and small interfering RNA–
mediated knockdown of GADD153 protected cells from
undergoing apoptosis in response to drug cotreatments.
Furthermore, the OSU-03012/EGFR inhibitor combination
induced GADD153-mediated up-regulation of death receptor
5 expression and subsequent activation of the extrinsic
apoptosis pathway. It is noteworthy that the ER stress response
induced by this combination was atypical in that the
cytoprotective pathway was not engaged. In addition, in vivo
suppression of tumor growth and modulation of intratumoral
biomarkers were observed in a H1155 tumor xenograft model
in nude mice. These data suggest that the concomitant
modulation of Akt and ER stress pathways with the OSU03012/EGFR inhibitor combination represents a unique
approach to overcoming EGFR inhibitor resistance in NSCLC
and perhaps other types of cancer with elevated basal Akt
activities. [Cancer Res 2008;68(8):2820–30]

of lung cancer cases, is initially responsive to chemotherapy;
however, drug-resistant disease ultimately recurs, resulting in a
poor prognosis for these patients (2, 3). Efforts to develop novel
therapeutic strategies for this disease have led to the approvals of
gefitinib and erlotinib, small-molecule inhibitors of epidermal
growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase, as third-line
therapies for the treatment of patients with advanced NSCLC.
Optimism surrounding these targeted agents, however, is tempered
by the occurrence of drug resistance that limits their efficacy to
10% to 30% of NSCLC patients (3–6). Extending the clinical
usefulness of these EGFR inhibitors to the majority of NSCLC
patients who are typically unresponsive will require the elucidation
of molecular mechanisms leading to this drug resistance.
Although aberrant overactivation of EGFR can lead to the
development and progression of human cancers, activating defects
in downstream signaling components can have similar consequences by bypassing normal EGFR-mediated regulation of cell growth
and survival. Indeed, functional defects of Ras, Raf, PTEN, and Akt
are frequent features of many types of human cancers (7, 8). In lung
cancer, overactivation of Akt secondary to loss of PTEN function is
well documented (9–11), and recent data indicate a role for
hyperactivated phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt signaling
in the resistance to EGFR inhibitors in NSCLC (12–14). These
findings suggest that simultaneous inhibition of EGFR and PI3K/
Akt pathways may be an effective therapeutic strategy to sensitize
resistant NSCLC tumors with aberrant PI3K/Akt signaling to the
growth inhibitory and apoptotic effects of the EGFR inhibitors.
OSU-03012, a novel celecoxib derivative that is devoid of
cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitory activity, potently induces
apoptosis and growth inhibition in cancer cells in association with
phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase-1 (PDK-1) inhibition
and subsequent inactivation of Akt and downstream survival
signaling pathways (15–17). Recently, the induction of endoplasmic
reticulum (ER) stress was also implicated in the antineoplastic
effects of OSU-03012. Yacoub et al. (18) observed ER stress
responses that were well-correlated with apoptosis in OSU03012–treated glioblastoma cells, a finding consistent with the
strong association between ER stress and apoptosis previously seen
in cells treated with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs,
including celecoxib (19). In the present study, we attempt to
exploit the multiple antitumor activities of OSU-03012 by testing
the hypothesis that treatment with gefitinib or erlotinib in
combination with OSU-03012 will overcome resistance to EGFR
inhibitors in NSCLC cells through inhibition of Akt signaling and
induction of ER stress responses. Our data show that apoptosis
induced by the drug combination in gefitinib/erlotinib–resistant

EGFR Inhibitors Combined with OSU-03012 in NSCLC

NSCLC cells expressing high Akt activity involves alterations in
survival pathways downstream of both Akt inhibition and ER stress
induction, and that these effects are observed in an in vivo
xenograft model of EGFR inhibitor–resistant NSCLC in association
with suppressed tumor growth.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture and reagents. The human NSCLC cell lines A549
(adenocarcinoma), NCI-H1155 (large cell carcinoma), and NCI-H23 (adenocarcinoma) were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection, and
maintained in the suggested complete growth medium. Gefitinib, erlotinib,
and celecoxib were prepared from commercial Iressa, Tarceva, and Celebrex
tablets, respectively, by solvent extraction followed by recrystallization. OSU03012 was synthesized according to the procedures previously described
(15). For in vivo studies, erlotinib and OSU-03012 were prepared as
suspensions in vehicle (0.5% methylcellulose, 0.1% Tween 80 in sterile
water) for oral administration to tumor-bearing immunocompromised mice.
LY294002 was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Information on antibodies
used in the study is provided in Supplementary Materials and Methods.
Cell viability analysis. A549 and H23 cells were seeded into 96-well
plates (5,000 per well), incubated overnight, and treated as indicated for
24 h. Nonadherent H1155 cells (10,000 per well) were directly suspended in
drug-containing medium, and incubated for 24 h. Control groups received
DMSO vehicle (0.1%, final concentration). After treatment, cells were
incubated in medium containing 0.4 mg/mL 3-[4,5-dimethyl- thiazol2-yl]-2,5-diphenyl-2H -tetrazolium bromide (MTT; TCI America) or
3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxy-phenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)2H-tetrazolium (MTS; Promega) at 37jC for 1 h. Reduced MTT was solubilized in DMSO for determination of absorbance at 570 nm. Absorbance of
reduced MTS was directly measured in the reaction medium at 490 nm.
Flow cytometry. Drug-treated cells were analyzed for apoptosis, cell
surface expression of DR5 protein, and caspase-8 activity by flow cytometry.
A549 and H23 cells were seeded into six-well plates (2  105 per well),
incubated overnight, and then treated as indicated. H1155 cells (4  105)
were directly suspended in drug-containing medium. For assessment of
apoptosis, cells were collected and stained with Annexin V–Alexa Fluor 488
and propidium iodide according to the vendor’s protocols (Molecular
Probes). For determination of DR5 expression, cells were incubated in PBS
containing phycoerythrin-conjugated antibodies against the extracellular
domain of DR5 for 30 min at room temperature. For measurement of
caspase-8 activity, cells were incubated with the fluorogenic caspase8 substrate, 1r-z (AnaSpec), for 20 min. Analyses were performed using a
FACSCalibur fluorescence-activated cell sorter (Becton Dickinson Immunocytometry Systems) equipped with CellQuest software.
Western blot analysis. Cell lysates were prepared using acidic lysis
buffer (pH 3.4) containing 50 mmol/L bis-(hydroxyethyl)-piperazine, 8 mol/L
urea, and 2% CHAPS. Equivalent amounts of proteins were resolved by SDSPAGE and then transferred to nitrocellulose membranes for immunoblotting
as described previously (20). For immunoblotting of biomarkers in xenograft
tumors, tumor-tissue homogenates were prepared and immunoblotting was
done as described previously (21).
Semiquantitative reverse transcription-PCR. Total RNA was isolated
using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) and chloroform extraction. The firststrand cDNA was synthesized using the iScript cDNA synthesis kit (Bio-Rad)
according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Reverse transcription and PCR
were performed in a Peltier thermal cycler (PTC-200, MJ Research) using
the following primers:
DR5 gene: 5¶-GCCTCATGGACAATGAGATAAAGGTGGCT-3¶/5¶-CACAATCTCAAAGTACGCACAAACGG-3¶.
b-actin gene: 5¶-ACACTGTGCCCATCTACGAGG-3¶/5¶-AGGGGCCGGACTCGTCATACT-3¶.
Ectopic expression of constitutively active Akt. The pcDNA3.1(+)/
ca-Akt plasmid containing cDNA encoding the constitutively active,
hemagglutinin-tagged, mutant (T308D/S473D) mouse Akt-1 (CA-Akt) was

provided by Dr. Matthew D. Ringel (The Ohio State University, Columbus,
OH; ref. 22). Cells were transfected using program A-023 of the AMAXA
Nucleofector system according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
Stable clones expressing the fusion protein were selected from transfected
cells using medium containing 250 Ag/mL geneticin (Invitrogen-Life
Technologies).
GADD153, DR5, and PDK-1 expression knockdown. Knockdowns of
GADD153 and DR5 expression were achieved by transfection with the
human DDIT3 SMARTpool small interfering RNA (siRNA) reagent (Dharmacon) and the human DR5 siRNA reagent (Santa Cruz Biotechnology),
respectively. Suppression of PDK-1 expression was achieved by transfection
with the HuSH 29mer short hairpin (shRNA) constructs against human
PDPK1 (OriGene Technologies). Cells (2  106) were mixed with 250 nmol/L
DDIT3 siRNA, 100 nmol/L DR5 siRNA, or 4 Ag of the shRNA expression
constructs and then nucleofected as described above.
Analysis of DR5 gene promoter activity. The pDR5Pro plasmid
containing a cDNA sequence encoding the modified firefly luciferase driven
by the DR5 promoter was constructed by PCR amplification of the 5¶
flanking region ( 8 to 329) of the DR5 gene from the genomic DNA of
H1155 cells and cloning into a pGL3-basic vector (Promega). Mutations
were introduced into the wild-type GADD153-binding sequence of the DR5
promoter using a site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) to generate the
pDR5Pro-GADD153mt plasmid. Both plasmids were sequenced to confirm
the fidelity of construction. The sequences of primers used for plasmid
construction and mutagenesis are provided in Supplementary Materials and
Methods. H1155 cells were cotransfected with the pDR5Pro or pDR5ProGADD153mt plasmid and a Renilla luciferase vector by nucleofection. Cells
were treated at the indicated drug concentrations for 12 h, and then assayed
for luciferase activities that were measured in a MicroLumatPlus LB96V
luminometer (Berthold Technologies). The firefly luciferase activity was
normalized to that of Renilla luciferase.
Transmission electron microscopy. H1155 cells (4  105 per well; sixwell plates) were treated with DMSO, a combination of 3 Amol/L OSU-03012
and 6 Amol/L gefitinib, or 5 Amol/L thapsigargin as a positive control for 8 h.
Cells were then fixed in a solution containing 8% paraformaldehyde, 5%
glutaraldehyde, 1% tannic acid, and 30 mmol/L sodium cacodylate for 1 h.
The fixed cells were suspended in a buffered solution containing 1% osmic
acid for 1 h, followed by dehydration in a graded ethanol series, washing
with acetone, and embedding into EPON epoxy resin. Ultrathin sections
(60–80 nm) were prepared on an ultramicrotome and double-stained with
uranyl acetate and lead citrate. All sections were examined and photographed with a Philips EM300 transmission electron microscope.
In vivo studies. Six-week-old female NCr athymic nude mice (National
Cancer Institute) were group-housed under conditions of constant
photoperiod (12 h light/12 h dark) with ad libitum access to sterilized
food and water. All experimental procedures using these mice were
performed in accordance with protocols approved by the Institutional
Animal Care and Use Committee of The Ohio State University.
Each mouse was inoculated s.c. with 5  105 H1155 cells in a total
volume of 0.1 mL serum-free medium containing 50% Matrigel (BD
Biosciences). As tumors became established (mean starting tumor volume,
108.5 F 8.6 mm3), mice were randomized to four groups (n = 10) that
received the following treatments: (a) methylcellulose/Tween 80 vehicle, (b)
OSU-03012 at 100 mg/kg body weight per day, (c) erlotinib at 100 mg/kg/d,
and (d) OSU-03012 plus erlotinib each at 100 mg/kg/d. Mice received
treatments by gavage (10 AL/g body weight) for the duration of the study.
Tumors were measured weekly using calipers and their volumes calculated
using a standard formula: width2  length  0.52. Body weights were
measured weekly. At terminal sacrifice, complete necropsies were
performed on all mice and tumors were harvested. A portion of each
tumor was frozen in liquid nitrogen for Western blotting analysis and the
remainder was fixed in 10% formalin for immunohistochemical staining of
relevant biomarkers. All other tissues were fixed in 10% formalin for
histopathologic examination. Blood from three to four mice from each
group was submitted to The Ohio State University Veterinary Clinical
Laboratory Services for evaluation of serum chemistry and hematologic
variables.

Histopathologic evaluation and immunohistochemistry. Formalinfixed tumor and visceral tissues from mice were embedded in paraffin by
routine procedures. H&E-stained, 4-Am sections of major organs from three
animals per group were evaluated microscopically by a veterinary
pathologist. The expression of relevant biomarkers in representative
sections of tumor tissues was detected by immunohistochemical staining
using specific primary antibodies and the EnVision Plus staining kit (Dako)
according to the supplier’s instructions. The proliferation and apoptotic
indices, as determined by proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) and
cleaved caspase-3 immunostaining, respectively, were calculated as the
number of immunopositive cells  100% divided by the total number of
cells per 400 field.
Statistical analysis. The JMP5.0.1 software package (SAS Institute) was
used to perform all data analysis. In vitro data were analyzed by the
Student’s t test. Survival analysis in the in vivo study was performed by the
Kaplan-Meier method and log-rank test. Differences were considered
significant at P < 0.05.

Results
OSU-03012 enhances EGFR inhibitor–induced apoptosis in
gefitinib/erlotinib–resistant NSCLC cells that express high
levels of phosphorylated Akt. The effects of OSU-03012, gefitinib,
and erlotinib on cell survival were assessed in three different
gefitinib/erlotinib–resistant NSCLC cell lines—H1155, H23, and
A549. As expected, erlotinib and gefitinib were weak inhibitors of
viability in all three cell lines with IC50 values >10 Amol/L (Fig. 1A).
In contrast, H1155, H23, and A549 cells were sensitive to the effects
of OSU-03012, which caused dose-dependent reductions in cell
survival (Fig. 1A) and in levels of phosphorylated Akt (Fig. 1B).
Moreover, these cell lines exhibited differential sensitivities to the
cytotoxic effects of OSU-03012 (IC50 values of 3.5, 5.3, and 9.1 Amol/L
for H1155, H23, and A549, respectively) that correlated with their
relative basal levels of phosphorylated Akt (Fig. 1A), which was
highest in the most sensitive cell line, H1155, and lowest in the least
sensitive cell line, A549.
To assess the effect of cotreatment with OSU-03012 and EGFR
inhibitors on cell survival, cells were exposed to individual agents or
a combination of OSU-03012 with gefitinib or erlotinib at a fixed
concentration ratio of 1:2. Flow cytometric analysis of phosphatidylserine externalization as revealed by Annexin V staining showed
that cotreatment with OSU-03012 enhanced the ability of EGFR
inhibitors to induce apoptosis in H1155 and, to a lesser extent,
H23 cells (Fig. 1C and D). For example, in the presence of 3 Amol/L
OSU-03012, representing its IC20 as a single agent in H1155 cells,
the extent of apoptosis induction by 6 Amol/L gefitinib or erlotinib
increased from <5% to 40% relative to the DMSO vehicle control
(Fig. 1C). In contrast, the combination treatments caused only
modest elevations in the numbers of A549 cells undergoing apoptosis, which were much lower than the striking increases in apoptosis
seen in the combination-treated H1155 and H23 cells (Fig. 1D).
Interestingly, the differential sensitivities of these three cell lines to
the OSU-03012/EGFR inhibitor combination were well correlated
with basal Akt activity, but not with endogenous levels of wild-type
EGFR, which is expressed in all of the cell lines used (Fig. 1A; ref. 23).
The combination of OSU-03012 and EGFR inhibitor induces
the concomitant inhibition of Akt signaling and up-regulation
of GADD153. To clarify the mechanism by which OSU-03012
enhanced the antitumor activities of the EGFR inhibitors, we
examined the Akt phosphorylation status in treated H1155, H23,
and A549 cells (Fig. 2A). Although treatment with 3 Amol/L OSU03012 or 6 Amol/L gefitinib or erlotinib alone for 8 hours failed to
notably affect levels of phospho-Akt in H1155 cells, the combina-

tion of OSU-03012 with either EGFR inhibitor (concentration ratio,
1:2) reduced the phosphorylation level of Akt in a dose-dependent
manner (top left). The responses of H23 cells to single-agent
treatments and to the OSU-03012/EGFR inhibitor combination
were similar to those of the H1155 cells, except that reductions in
phospho-Akt levels were not observed until 24 hours of treatment
(bottom panels). The A549 cells were also sensitive to the
suppressive effect of the combination treatment on phospho-Akt
levels (top right), although they were much less sensitive to
apoptosis induction by the combined treatment than the other two
cell lines (Fig. 1D). To more directly assess the role of PDK-1/Akt
pathway inhibition in the apoptotic activity of the OSU-03012/
EGFR inhibitor combination, apoptosis was evaluated in H1155
cells treated with EGFR inhibitor alone or in combination with
either the PI3K inhibitor LY294002 or shRNA-mediated knockdown
of PDK-1. Figure 2B (left) shows that, although the combination of
erlotinib with 20 Amol/L LY294002 reduced phospho-Akt to a level
comparable with that of the erlotinib/OSU-03012 combination, the
induction of apoptosis was significantly less than that resulting
from the erlotinib/OSU-03012 treatment. Similarly, EGFR inhibitor
treatment of H1155 cells in which Akt was inactivated by shRNAmediated PDK1 knockdown failed to induce apoptosis as the OSU03012/EGFR inhibitor combination did in mock-transfected cells
(Fig. 2B, right). Knockdown of PDK-1, however, significantly
intensified apoptosis induced by OSU-03012 treatment in combination with EGFR inhibitors. Together, these findings suggest that,
in addition to Akt signaling, another mechanism governs the
sensitivity of NSCLC cells to apoptotic induction after combined
treatment with OSU-03012 and erlotinib or gefitinib.
In light of evidence that OSU-03012 induces ER stress responses
in glioblastoma cells (18), we evaluated the effects of OSU-03012,
gefitinib, and erlotinib alone and in combination on the expression
of GADD153, a well-recognized ER stress-inducible transcription
factor. As shown in Fig. 2A, all three drugs up-regulated GADD153
in H1155 and H23 cells but not in A549 cells. Notably, this elevation
of GADD153 expression was dramatically intensified in H1155 and
H23 cells after treatment with the indicated drug combinations,
but again not in A549 cells. Moreover, the expression of cyclic
AMP–responsive element binding protein 2 (CREB2), a positive
transcriptional regulator of the GADD153 gene that is also
associated with the ER stress response, paralleled that of GADD153
after the combination treatment in all three cell lines, suggesting
an ER stress–induced, CREB2-mediated mechanism for GADD153
up-regulation in the responsive H1155 and H23 cells (Fig. 2C, right).
The ER stress response usually includes a cytoprotective
function that is mediated through the up-regulation of chaperone
proteins, such as GRP78 and GRP94 (Fig. 2C, left; ref. 24). It is
noteworthy that the ER stress response elicited by the OSU-03012/
EGFR inhibitor combination was atypical in this regard in that it
failed to induce the cytoprotective arm of the response as indicated
by the unchanged expression levels of these chaperone proteins in
treated NSCLC cells (Fig. 2C, right).
Taken together, these findings suggest that the concomitant
suppression of Akt signaling and up-regulation of GADD153
expression underlies the sensitivity of H1155 and H23 cells to the
apoptogenic effects of OSU-03012/EGFR inhibitor combinations. To
corroborate this premise, we assessed the protective effects of
ectopic expression of the constitutively active, T308D/S473Ddouble mutant Akt (CA-Akt) and siRNA-mediated knockdown of
GADD153 expression against the antitumor activity of OSU-03012/
EGFR inhibitor combinations in H1155 cells. As shown in Fig. 3A,

the H1155 stable transfectants with highest CA-Akt expression
levels (clones 3 and 4; top left) were partially, yet significantly,
protected from the apoptotic effects of OSU-03012/EGFR inhibitor
combinations after 24 hours of treatment compared with the
empty vector transfectants (P < 0.05; bottom left and right).
Moreover, this protective effect of CA-Akt was also reflected in the
phosphorylation status of the Akt substrate, GSK3h, in that the
reduction in phospho-GSK3h observed after OSU-03012/EGFR
inhibitor treatment was prevented in the CA-Akt transfectants
(Fig. 3A, top right). Similarly, flow cytometric analysis revealed that
siRNA-mediated suppression of GADD153 levels substantially
reduced the number of H1155 cells undergoing apoptosis in
response to cotreatment with OSU-03012 and gefitinib (Fig. 3B).
The combination of OSU-03012 with EGFR inhibitors
induces GADD153-mediated up-regulation of death receptor
DR5 expression and activates the extrinsic apoptosis pathway.
The GADD153 protein is a well-documented regulator of DR5 gene

expression (25, 26). Consequently, the effects of the OSU-03012/
EGFR inhibitor combinations on DR5 expression at both the mRNA
and protein levels were determined in H1155 cells. As revealed by
reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) analysis, treatment with OSU03012 in combination with either gefitinib or erlotinib for 12 hours
dose-dependently elevated DR5 mRNA levels (Fig. 4A, top panels).
These results were consistent with flow cytometric data showing
increased numbers of H1155 cells expressing elevated amounts of
cell surface DR5 protein after 24 hours of treatment (Fig. 4A, bottom
panels).
To establish the involvement of GADD153 in the drug-induced
transcriptional up-regulation of DR5 gene expression, assays using
luciferase reporter genes driven by the DR5 promoter containing
either the wild-type or a mutated GADD153-binding sequence were
performed. As expected, wild-type DR5 promoter activity was
significantly elevated in H1155 cells treated with the OSU-03012/
EGFR inhibitor combinations (Fig. 4B). In contrast, mutation of the

GADD153 binding sequence eliminated this drug-induced activation of the DR5 promoter, strongly indicating that the upregulation of GADD153 expression in H1155 cells after treatment
with the OSU-03012/EGFR inhibitor combinations mediates the
associated elevation of DR5 expression.
Next, we sought to establish a link between this drug-induced,
GADD153-mediated up-regulation of DR5 expression and the
apoptogenic activity of the OSU-03012/EGFR inhibitor combina-

tion in NSCLC cells. Because up-regulation and activation of death
receptors is associated with the initiation of cancer cell apoptosis,
even in the absence of exogenous ligands (25–29), we first assessed
indicators of the extrinsic apoptosis pathway as evidence of active
DR5 signaling in drug-treated cells. Using a fluorogenic substrate of
caspase-8, flow cytometry revealed enhanced caspase-8 activity in
H1155 cells treated with OSU-03012 in combination with EGFR
inhibitor for 24 hours, compared with those treated with each drug

caspase-8 activity was accompanied by enhanced cleavage of Bid
(bottom). In addition, siRNA-mediated knockdown of DR5 prevented the up-regulation of DR5 mRNA expression observed in
H1155 cells after OSU-03012/EGFR inhibitor treatment and
significantly reduced the percentage of treated cells undergoing
apoptosis (Fig. 4D). Together, these findings support a mechanistic
framework for the induction of apoptosis in gefitinib/erlotinib–
resistant NSCLC cells by OSU-03012/EGFR inhibitor combinations
in which the ER stress–inducible transcription factor, GADD153, is
induced, leading to up-regulated DR5 expression and stimulation
of apoptosis.

with OSU-03012 and erlotinib, both alone and in combination, each
at 100 mg/kg body weight per day, or with vehicle. Tumor growth
was assessed by survival analysis with survival time defined as the
time for tumors to reach a volume of 1,200 mm3. As shown in
Fig. 6A, the combination treatment significantly prolonged survival,
i.e., delayed tumor growth, compared with all other treatments
(P < 0.05). The estimated mean survival time of mice administered
the OSU031012/erlotinib combination was >30 days, whereas the
mean survival times of the other groups were <18 days. Moreover,
mice tolerated all of the treatments without overt signs of toxicity
as indicated by general observations of health, maintenance of
body weight, and unremarkable hematology and serum chemistry
findings. Centrilobular hepatocellular hypertrophy was observed in
mice from both groups receiving OSU-03012 treatments. Aside
from this change, which we have reported previously (32), no
significant lesions were detected in any tissues from animals
subjected to histopathologic examination. To correlate these
in vivo antitumor effects with mechanisms identified in vitro,
intratumoral biomarkers of drug activity were assessed by
immunohistochemistry and immunoblotting of tumor homogenates. As shown by both techniques, the combination treatment
markedly reduced levels of phospho-Akt and elevated levels of
GADD153 within tumors (Fig. 6B). In addition, immunohistochemical evaluation of PCNA revealed diminished proliferation within
tumors from all treatment groups compared with control tumors,
whereas assessment of cleaved caspase-3 indicated elevated
apoptosis in tumors from mice treated with OSU-03012 alone
and in combination with erlotinib (Fig. 6C).

Discussion
In this study, we show that combining erlotinib or gefitinib with
OSU-03012 potently induces apoptosis in EGFR inhibitor–resistant
NSCLC cells. Moreover, we provide evidence that sensitivity of
these resistant NSCLC cells to this combinatorial approach
correlates with their endogenous levels of phospho-Akt, involves
Akt inhibition, and enhances apoptotic signaling downstream of ER
stress induction.
Hyperactive Akt signaling has been associated with resistance to
EGFR inhibitors in NSCLC, suggesting that combined inhibition of
Akt and EGFR signaling represents a rational and promising
strategy for overcoming this resistance. Our findings support this
contention by showing that treatment of the EGFR inhibitor–
resistant H1155 and H23 cell lines with OSU-03012 in combination
with gefitinib or erlotinib severely reduced cell survival and
enhanced apoptosis in association with diminished phosphorylation of Akt. Moreover, enforced expression of a constitutively active
Akt partially but significantly attenuated these inhibitory effects on
cell survival, thereby validating Akt signaling as an antitumor target
for this drug combination.
Recently, the antitumor activity of OSU-03012 was shown to
include the induction of ER stress responses (18). Here we show
that, individually, OSU-03012, gefitinib and erlotinib induced ER
stress in H1155 and H23 cells as indicated by the nominal upregulation of GADD153. To our knowledge, this is the first report
describing the modulation of ER stress–related pathways by
erlotinib and gefitinib. In cells treated with the OSU-03012/EGFR
inhibitor combination, this elevation of GADD153 expression was

markedly augmented and was associated with increased levels
of CREB2, an ER stress–inducible transcriptional regulator of
GADD153 expression, and ultrastructural changes indicative of ER
stress.
Although the precise molecular mechanism by which these
agents, individually and particularly in combination, induce this ER
stress response remains incompletely characterized, our data

suggest that the effects of gefitinib and erlotinib are independent
of EGFR inhibition as indicated by unchanged EGFR autophosphorylation in H23 cells treated with erlotinib at concentrations
sufficient to enhance GADD153 expression (Supplementary Fig. S1).
Plausible candidates for the off-target effects of gefitinib and
erlotinib include proteins potentially involved in ER stress
formation, such as HSP90, Lyn, and Fyn, which have been reported

to directly interact with gefitinib (33). Our data also indicate this
induction of ER stress to be independent of PDK-1 inhibition, as the
suppression of Akt signaling with either the PI3K inhibitor
LY294002, or the siRNA-mediated knockdown of PDK-1 could not
fully mimic the apoptotic effects of OSU-03012 in combinations
with EGFR inhibitors. Disruption of ER calcium homeostasis is a
well-documented stimulus for ER stress (34). Consequently, we
examined changes in intracellular calcium concentrations in
response to treatments with OSU-03012 and gefitinib alone and in
combination. A rapid and markedly amplified increase in intracellular calcium concentration was observed after the combination
treatment (Supplementary Fig. S2). This finding is reminiscent of
that reported for celecoxib, from which OSU-03012 is derived, in
prostate cancer cells in which the inhibition of ER Ca2+-ATPases
was implicated (35). Moreover, treatment with the OSU-03012/
erlotinib combination induced the phosphorylation of protein
kinase regulated by RNA-like ER kinase (PERK) and its substrate
eIF2a in the responsive H1155 and H23 cells (Supplementary
Fig. S3), thereby providing a putative mechanistic link between drug
treatment and GADD153 up-regulation. Based on these findings,
we hypothesize that perturbation of ER calcium homeostasis is the
upstream trigger for activation of PERK/eIF2a signaling, leading to
further induction of ER stress responses in cancer cells treated
with the OSU-03012/EGFR inhibitor combination. More thorough
investigation of this potential mechanism is under way.
Although the precise mechanism by which these agents induce
ER stress responses remains undetermined, data from knockdowns of GADD153 and death receptor DR5, and DR5 promoter
analysis provide strong evidence for a mechanistic link between
GADD153 up-regulation and the apoptogenic effects of OSU03012/EGFR inhibitor combinations through activation of the
extrinsic apoptosis pathway. Moreover, it is noteworthy that the
combination treatments did not up-regulate the cytoprotective
chaperones typically associated with ER stress, a finding that
distinguishes OSU/EGFR inhibitor combinations from the wellestablished pharmacologic inducers of ER stress, thapsigargin
and tunicamycin.
Celecoxib at supraphysiologic doses induces apoptosis in
association with up-regulated expression of ER stress–inducible
proteins (19, 36) and death receptor DR5 (37) in a variety of cell
types, including NSCLC cells. Our findings using therapeutically
achievable concentrations of OSU-03012, a COX-2–inactive celecoxib derivative, suggest that its ability to trigger ER stress
represents another COX-2–independent activity in addition to
PDK-1/Akt signaling inhibition. The rationale of dual inhibition of
COX-2 and EGFR as a therapeutic approach has led to recent phase
I trials of celecoxib/EGFR inhibitor combinations for the treatment
of head and neck cancer and NSCLC (38, 39). Evidence presented
here suggests that OSU-03012 represents a feasible alternative in
such combinations through its potent COX-2–independent effects
on both Akt signaling and ER stress–mediated apoptotic pathways.
The in vivo efficacy of the OSU-03012/erlotinib combination was
shown in a H1155 tumor xenograft model in which tumor growth
was significantly inhibited in association with diminished phospho-

Akt and elevated GADD153 levels within tumors and in the absence
of limiting toxicities.
In the current study, the EGFR inhibitor/OSU-03012 combinations were assessed in vitro at a fixed 2:1 ratio using 6 and 3 Amol/L
concentrations, respectively, which were selected for proof-ofprinciple mechanistic studies based on the results of preceding
dose-range experiments (Figs. 1D and 2A). Although the 6 Amol/L
concentration used for the EGFR inhibitors is greater than the
average steady-state plasma levels of gefitinib and erlotinib
achieved in cancer patients (40–45), this concentration is within
the range of reported peak plasma concentrations for erlotinib
(44, 46–48). Moreover, induction of apoptosis, GADD153 expression, and DR5 expression were still observed after treatment with
the erlotinib/OSU-03012 combination at the lower doses of 4 and
2 Amol/L, respectively.
Based on our findings, parallel suppression of Akt signaling and
ER stress–mediated up-regulation of GADD153 expression underlies the sensitivity of H1155 and H23 cells to cotreatment with OSU03012 and EGFR inhibitors. However, A549 cells were found to be
extremely insensitive to the OSU-03012/EGFR inhibitor combination. The differential responsiveness among these cell lines to this
combination, as well as to OSU-03012 alone, was strongly
correlated with basal levels of phosphorylated Akt, but not with
wild-type EGFR expression level. The more sensitive cells, H1155
and H23, exhibited much higher levels of phospho-Akt, likely due to
a nonsense mutation in the PTEN gene (49, 50), whereas A549
contained the lowest level. This finding suggests a greater
dependence of H1155 and H23 cells on Akt signaling for survival
and resistance to EGFR inhibitors. Alternatively, the OSU-03012/
EGFR inhibitor combination may engage additional apoptotic
pathway(s) in the sensitive H1155 and H23 cells that are not
induced in A549 cells. Our results suggest that ER stress is this
alternative pathway as A549 cells failed to generate an ER stress
response after the combination treatment. Moreover, the finding
that Akt activity is a determinant of responsiveness to this drug
combination is clinically significant in that it may provide a means
of selecting patients with EGFR inhibitor–resistant NSCLC tumors
that are more likely to respond to this strategy.
The data reported here offer evidence for the efficacy of a
unique, combinatorial approach to overcome EGFR inhibitor
resistance in NSCLC. This strategy targets both the Akt signaling
pathway and the ER stress response, which underlies its potent
in vitro and in vivo antitumor effects and suggests its viability as a
therapeutic strategy for the treatment of EGFR inhibitor–resistant
NSCLC.
