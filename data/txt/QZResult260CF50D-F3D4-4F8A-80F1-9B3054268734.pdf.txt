The Use of Anticoagulants Improves
Biochemical Control of Localized Prostate
Cancer Treated With Radiotherapy
Kevin S. Choe, MD, PhD1; David Correa, BS1; Ashesh B. Jani, MD2; and Stanley L. Liauw, MD1

BACKGROUND: Substantial experimental evidence suggests that anticoagulants (ACs) may inhibit cancer growth
and metastasis, although the limited data from clinical trials have been inconsistent. The potential antineoplastic
effect of ACs was investigated in patients who received radiotherapy for localized prostate cancer. METHODS: The
study cohort consisted of 662 patients with adenocarcinoma of the prostate who received radiotherapy (RT) with curative intent. Among those 622 men, 243 (37%) were receiving ACs (warfarin, clopidogrel, and/or aspirin). All patients
received external-beam RT, permanent seed implantation, or a combination of both. Prostate-specific antigen (PSA)
values were monitored for biochemical control of disease. RESULTS: At a median follow-up of 49 months, the biochemical control rate at 4-years was significantly better in patients who received ACs at 91% compared with 78% in
patients who did not receive ACs (P ¼ .0002). The distant metastasis rate at 4 years also was reduced in the AC
group compared with the non-AC group (1% vs 5%; P ¼ .0248). In subgroup analysis, the improvement in biochemical
control was significant only for patients with high-risk disease. Along with Gleason score, T classification, and initial
PSA, the use of AC therapy was associated independently with improved biochemical control in multivariate analysis.
CONCLUSIONS: AC therapy was associated with an improvement in biochemical control in patients with prostate
cancer who received RT with curative intent. The effect was most prominent in patients who had high-risk disease.

The association between cancer and the coagulation system is widely recognized. Cancer patients develop thromboembolism more frequently than noncancer patients,1,2 and patients who are diagnosed with idiopathic venous thrombosis are
at increased risk of subsequently developing cancer.3,4 There are substantial experimental data to suggest that the coagulation system may modulate multiple cancer pathways, such as tumor proliferation, angiogenesis, host immunologic
defense, and metastasis.5-10 In turn, there has been interest in the use of anticoagulants, such as warfarin and aspirin, as antineoplastic agents. Clinical studies have been limited and have resulted in inconsistent conclusions.11-17
The first randomized study to investigate the anticancer effect of anticoagulants was conducted by the Veterans
Administration.14 They studied the impact of warfarin in addition to standard therapy on survival in several solid cancer
types, including lung, colon, head and neck, and prostate. They reported no survival differences in all cancer types studied,
except in small cell lung cancer. Most patients in that study had disseminated disease at the time of enrollment. In another
study from Sweden, 854 patients with newly diagnosed venous thromboembolism were assigned randomly to receive either 6 weeks or 6 months of warfarin therapy.18 At a mean follow-up of 8 years, those who received warfarin for 6 months
were less likely to develop cancer than those who received it for 6 weeks. The difference was noted mainly in the development of urogenital cancers, especially prostate cancer. Although the mechanism by which warfarin may reduce cancer incidence was unclear, those investigators postulated that the prolonged exposure of warfarin may have reversed a
hypercoagulable state necessary for cancer growth or spread. In this manner, warfarin may inhibit the growth of microscopic tumors that are too small for clinical diagnosis. The potential antineoplastic effect of warfarin was corroborated by

a subsequent, large, population-based study with
>130,000 patients that, again, demonstrated a reduction
in cancer incidence with warfarin use.19 The study also
suggested that the effect may be most pronounced in prostate cancer.
Similar to warfarin, there is clinical evidence that aspirin also inhibits tumor growth. A prospective study of
662,424 adults demonstrated a significant association
with aspirin use and a decrease in mortality from colon
cancer.17 Another large cohort study of 146,113 patients
demonstrated that daily use of aspirin was associated with
reduced risks of overall cancer and specifically prostate
cancer among men.16 To further investigate the potential
antineoplastic effect of anticoagulants in prostate cancer,
we reviewed the biochemical outcomes of patients with
prostate cancer who received anticoagulation (AC) and
definitive radiotherapy (RT).

MATERIALS AND METHODS
The current study included patients with nonmetastatic
adenocarcinoma of the prostate who received treatment
with definitive RT at the University of Chicago, Pritzker
School of Medicine from 1988 to 2005. Included patients
had at least 2 years of potential follow-up and no prostatectomy as a component of treatment. Forty-five patients
had no documented list of medications, and they were
excluded. Patients were assigned to the AC group if they
had listed warfarin, clopidogrel, or aspirin on the medication list at the time of initial consultation or follow-up visits. Six hundred sixty-two patients were included, and 243
of those patients were in the AC group. Review of these
patients was undertaken with approval from the hospital’s
institutional review board.
Patient and disease characteristics are listed in Table 1. The median age of the entire group was 69 years.
The median initial prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level
was 8.4 ng/mL (range, 0.6-242.1 ng/mL). Patients were
categorized with low-risk, intermediate-risk, or high-risk
disease according to the National Comprehensive Cancer
Network classification.20 Low-risk disease was defined as
a pretreatment PSA level 10 ng/mL, a Gleason score
(GS) 6, and T1 to T2a disease. Intermediate-risk disease
was defined as any single risk factor, including a pretreatment PSA level between 10 ng/mL and 20 ng/mL, a GS
of 7, or T2b to T2c disease. High-risk disease was defined
as any single risk factor, including a PSA level >20 ng/
mL, a GS 8, or T3 disease. The majority of patients had
low-risk disease (37.5%) or intermediate-risk disease

(37.6%). One hundred sixty-three patients (24.8%) had
high-risk disease. Four hundred patients (60.4%) had a
GS 6, 203 patients (30.7%) had a GS of 7, and 59
patients (8.9%) had a GS 8. Thirty-five patients (5.3%)
had T3 disease, and no patient had T4 disease. One hundred five patients (15.9%) received a permanent seed
implant; 61 patients received seed implantation as their
sole therapy, and 44 received seed implantation in combination with external-beam RT (EBRT). The median
EBRT dose was 72.0 grays (Gy) (range, 44.8-76.4 Gy)
with standard fractionation of 1.8 Gy or 2.0 Gy daily.
Iodine-125 was used for permanent seed implantation at a
dose of 144 Gy. For implantation boost after EBRT, the

dose was 108 Gy. The prescription of EBRT dose was to
the minimal isodose line that encompassed the planning
target volume (PTV). The PTV was established by
expanding the prostate by 6 mm to 10 mm. Forty-two
patients (6.3%) who had a high risk of subclinical lymph
node involvement received whole-pelvic RT (WPRT).
The use of androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT) was at
the discretion of treating physicians over the study period.
ADT was received by 275 patients (41.5%) and typically
consisted of a luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone
analogue and an antiandrogen for a median of 4 months.
Of 255 patients with available records, 218 patients
(85%) received ADT for <6 months, 23 patients (9%)
received ADT for 6 to 12 months, and 14 patients (5.5%)
received ADT for >12 months.
The median warfarin dose was 5 mg daily. For
patients who were taking various doses of warfarin during
the week, the mean daily dose averaged over the week was
calculated. The target International Normalized Ratios
were not uniform for all patients, but most patients on
warfarin had a goal of 2-3. For all patients on clopidogrel,
the dose was 75 mg daily. The dose for aspirin varied
between 81 mg and 325 mg, and the median dose was not
known. Patients on aspirin typically had indications (eg,
coronary artery disease) for daily use rather than as-needed
only use. The duration or the onset of AC therapy was not
controlled in this study. Generally, once AC therapy was
initiated, it continued indefinitely. The data for AC therapy duration were available for 48 patients who were taking warfarin or clopidogrel. For those who were on
warfarin or clopidogrel before RT, the median duration
of AC use was 80 months (range, 4-120 months), and AC
therapy continued after RT. For those who started warfarin or clopidogrel after RT, the median duration was 32.5
months (range, 7-84 months) to the time of the last
follow-up.
After the completion of RT, patients generally were
followed at intervals of 3 to 9 months for 5 years and
yearly thereafter. The median follow-up, calculated from
the date of RT completion to the last PSA measurement,
was 49.3 months (range, 0.4-275.8 months). Biochemical
failure after RT was defined as PSA increase >2 ng/mL
from the post-treatment nadir according to the Phoenix
consensus definition.21 The time to biochemical failure
was defined as the time of the first such increase after RT
completion. Deaths from any cause were censored if the
primary endpoint was not met.
Comparisons between the AC group and the control
group were made using the chi-square test for categorical

continuous variables dichotomized by the median value.
Those variables that had P values .10 were tested in multivariate analysis. Multivariate analysis was carried out
using the Cox proportional-hazards model. Kaplan-Meier
curves for freedom from biochemical failure (FFBF) were
generated, and comparisons between groups were made
with the log-rank test (Table 2).

RESULTS
Patient Characteristics
The patient characteristics and treatment details are summarized in Table 1. Patients who did or did not receive AC
had similar demographic, disease, and treatment characteristics. Specifically, there were no significant differences in
the length of follow-up, in the disease risk category, or in
the distribution of T classification or GS. The median initial
PSA was slightly lower in the AC group compared with the
control group (8.02 ng/mL vs 8.53 ng/mL; P ¼ .0008).
The use of intensity-modulated RT (IMRT) was more common in the AC group, and the median dose of EBRT was
higher in the AC group (74.0 Gy vs 72.0 Gy; P ¼ .0118).
However, more patients in the control group received

144 Gy (18.1% vs 11.9%; P ¼ .0002).
Of the 243 patients in the AC group, 58 patients
were on warfarin (23.9%), 24 patients were on clopidogrel (9.9%), and 196 patients were on aspirin (80.7%).
Among the patients on aspirin, 16 patients also were on
warfarin, and 19 patients also were on clopidogrel. No
patients were taking the combination of warfarin and clopidogrel. One hundred ninety-five patients were on AC
before RT (80.2%), and 48 were started on AC after RT
completion (19.8%).
Comparison of Outcomes Between the AC
and Control Groups
The actuarial biochemical control rate for the entire group
was 83.3% at 4 years. When the rate of FFBF was compared between the 2 groups, the AC group had a significantly better FFBF rate of 91.2% at 4 years compared
with 78.3% in the control group (P ¼ .0002). KaplanMeier curves for FFBF are shown in Figure 1.
The 4-year overall survival rates were not different
between the AC group and the control group (92.2% and
90.3%, respectively; P ¼ .8838). There were 4 patients in
the AC group and 21 patients in the control group who
had clinically overt distant metastasis. The 4-year actuarial
rate of distant metastasis was 5% in the control group and
1% in the AC group, and this difference was statistically
significant (log-rank test; P ¼ .0248).

ciation with FFBF. On univariate analysis, T classification
<T2b, a GS <7, a PSA less than the median (8.4 ng/mL),
an RT dose higher than the median (72 Gy), the use of
IMRT, and AC therapy were associated significantly with
improved FFBF at 4 years (Table 3). Hormone therapy
and WPRT were not associated with FFBF. When significant variables on univariate analysis were evaluated further
in multivariate analysis, only IMRT was no longer associated significantly with FFBF (Table 3). Specifically, AC
therapy was associated significantly with improved biochemical control, independent of other major prognostic
factors.
To characterize the group of patients who may benefit the most from the AC therapy, several subgroup analyses were performed. When the entire group was divided
by risk category, the difference in biochemical control
between the AC group and the control group was most
prominent for patients in the high-risk group (Fig. 2),
and the difference was significant only in the high-risk
group (Table 3).

AC indicates anticoagulation; FFBF, freedom from biochemical failure.

Table 4 demonstrates that, within the AC group, the
type of AC agent did not significantly influence the 4-year
FFBF (P ¼ .8488). A combination of 2 agents (ie, warfarin and aspirin or clopidogrel and aspirin) was not associated with better biochemical control than a single agent.
Similarly, the onset of AC therapy (ie, before or after RT)
also did not have an impact on FFBF. The 4-year FFBF
rate for the 48 patients who started AC therapy after RT
was 90.9%, compared with 91.3% in 195 patients who
started AC therapy before RT (P ¼ .8143).

DISCUSSION
Because of the possibility that warfarin and other anticoagulants may have an antineoplastic effect in prostate cancer, we investigated the impact of 3 anticoagulation
agents—warfarin, clopidogrel, and aspirin—on PSA control after definitive RT for localized prostate cancer. We
demonstrated that biochemical control improved significantly for patients who received AC therapy compared
with the control group. Furthermore, on multivariate
analysis, the use of AC was associated independently with
better biochemical control.
The potential mechanisms by which warfarin, clopidogrel, and aspirin may exert antineoplastic effects on
cancer cells are diverse and not well understood. They
probably depend on the origin of the primary tumor and
the type of anticoagulation. It has been demonstrated that
anticoagulants play a role in various cellular pathways that
may interfere with tumor growth and dissemination. For
example, warfarin inhibits the generation of coagulation
serine proteases, altering the expression of genes that are
involved in tumor proliferation.22 Warfarin also may
interfere with angiogenesis by inhibiting the activity of basic fibroblast growth factor, which is a potent inducer of
angiogenesis.23 Inhibitors of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa, such as
clopidogrel, also have demonstrated the ability to suppress
the release of vascular endothelial growth factor.24

1824

Another important tumor pathway that may be
blocked by anticoagulants is the metastatic cascade. Metastasis involves a complicated series of steps, including
escape from the primary tumor, intravasation, extravasation, invasion, angiogenesis, and growth. The molecular
pathways that orchestrate the intricate interplay between
the primary tumors and the host environment are subjects
of active investigation.25 A growing body of evidence suggests that anticoagulants may disturb this process at several points. In an in vitro model, anticoagulants inhibited
the adherence of prostate cancer cells to the endothelium,
which is a critical step in the metastatic cascade.26,27 Furthermore, when cancer cells are shed into the circulation,
they quickly form an aggregate with platelets that protects
tumor cells from the antitumor response of the host and
promotes lodging at distant sites.24,28,29 An antiplatelet
agent, such as clopidogrel, may impede this process. It is
noteworthy that, in the current study, we observed that
the rate of distant metastasis was reduced significantly in
patients who were receiving AC therapy compared with
the control group. Although the small number of patients
in our subgroup analyses precluded reaching any firm
conclusions, our findings were consistent with the notion
that AC therapy may disrupt the metastatic cascade.
All patients in this study were treated with definitive
RT, and it is also possible that AC therapy leads to
improved PSA outcomes by augmenting the tumorcidal
effect of RT. For example, tumor hypoxia is an important
adverse prognostic feature in many cancer types, especially
when treated with RT, and it is plausible that AC therapy
may lead to improved oxygenation and more potent RT.
However, in our current study, there was no difference in
4-year FFBF whether AC therapy was initiated before or
after RT, suggesting that the antineoplastic effect of AC
therapy on prostate cancer may be independent of RT.
Investigations that include more patients or perhaps surgically managed patients may test this hypothesis further.
Several clinical trials have studied the antitumor
effect of anticoagulants, mostly in patients with metastatic
disease.11-14,30,31 Although the findings were not consistent, a meta-analysis of 11 randomized studies indicated
that there was a significant decrease in 1-year cancer mortality by the addition of anticoagulants (relative risk,
0.905).32 One of the early randomized studies investigated the effect of warfarin in a variety of solid tumors,
including prostate cancer. Although there was a survival
prolongation for patients with small cell lung cancer, the
survival was unchanged among 24 patients who had metastatic prostate cancer (P ¼ .45).14 If the main
Cancer

antineoplastic effect of warfarin indeed is by inhibiting
metastasis, then a benefit may have been masked in these
patients with clinically evident metastases. Similarly, in
patients who have indolent prostate cancer that is unlikely
to metastasize, a benefit from anticoagulation therapy
may be limited. In accord with this hypothesis, we
observed the most benefit from AC therapy in patients
who had high-risk disease without overt metastases.
The use of anticoagulants like warfarin is associated
with an elevated risk of bleeding complications,33 which
may be even more significant in patients with cancer. Specifically in patients with prostate cancer patients who
receive EBRT, we previously reported that grade 3 or
worse bleeding toxicity was observed in 16% of the
patients who were receiving warfarin or clopidogrel.
Before proceeding with further clinical studies, the risk of
serious bleeding must be weighed against the potential
benefit. With the newer class of anticoagulants, such as
low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH), the bleeding
risk may be lower. Recent studies investigating the antineoplastic effect of LMWH have indicated that incidence
of major bleeding is much lower at 0.5% to 3%.12,30,31
To our knowledge, this is the first report to study
the effect of anticoagulant therapy on nonmetastatic prostate cancer treated with RT. The conclusions are subject
to limitations from the retrospective nature of the analysis.
Most important, the duration and the onset of anticoagulant therapy were not controlled. The patients were
treated at a single institution during a period that spanned
many years. In addition, this study was limited to patients
who received RT. It would be interesting to study patients
with prostate cancer who undergo radical prostatectomy,
because the greatest benefit from anticoagulants may be
observed in patients who have minimal disease burden.
In conclusion, we demonstrated that the use of anticoagulation therapy is associated with improved PSA control in patients with prostate cancer who receive RT. The
potential benefit appears to be most pronounced in
patients with high-risk disease but no overt evidence of
metastasis. The current study suggests that anticoagulants
may have an antineoplastic effect in prostate cancer. The
mechanism of the antineoplastic effect remains speculative, but it may work by suppressing metastasis. The
results of this study are hypothesis-generating, and additional studies will be necessary to substantiate these
findings.
