BACKGROUND: Therapeutic options for patients with anaplastic gliomas (AGs) are limited despite better insights
into glioma biology. The authors previously reported improved outcome in patients with recurrent glioblastoma
treated with thalidomide and irinotecan compared with historical controls. Here, results of the AG arm of the study
are reported, using this drug combination. METHODS: Adults with recurrent AG previously treated with radiation
therapy, with Karnofsky performance score 70, adequate organ function and not on enzyme-inducing anticonvulsants were enrolled. Treatment was in 6-week cycles with irinotecan at 125 mg/m2 weekly for 4 weeks followed by 2
weeks off, and thalidomide at 100 mg daily increased to 400 mg/day as tolerated. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival rate at 6 months (PFS-6), and the secondary endpoints were overall survival (OS) and response
rate (RR). RESULTS: In 39 eligible patients, PFS-6 for the intent-to-treat population was 36% (95% confidence interval
[CI] ¼ 21%, 53%), median PFS was 13 weeks (95% CI ¼ 6%, 28%) and RR was 10%(95% CI ¼ 3%, 24%). Radiological
findings included 2 complete and 2 partial responses and 17 stable disease. Median OS from study registration was
62 weeks, (95% CI ¼ 51, 144). Treatment-related toxicities (grade 3 or higher) included neutropenia, diarrhea, nausea,
and fatigue; 6 patients experienced venous thromboembolism. Four deaths were attributable to treatment-related
toxicities: 1 from pulmonary embolism, 2 from colitis, and 1 from urosepsis. CONCLUSIONS: The combination of thalidomide and irinotecan did not achieve sufficient efficacy to warrant further investigation against AG, although a subset of patients experienced prolonged PFS/OS.

Malignant gliomas are aggressive primary brain tumors with a high morbidity and mortality. Although new standards of care have emerged for patients with newly diagnosed1 and recurrent glioblastoma,2 treatment options for patients
with anaplastic gliomas (AGs) remain limited. Meta-analyses of clinical trials using conventional cytotoxic chemotherapy
for patients with newly diagnosed malignant gliomas have indicated only a modest benefit from the addition of chemotherapy.3 The median survival for patients with AGs was reported to be 33.5 months in a recent large series.4 Ongoing trials are examining the utility of chemotherapy in patients with newly diagnosed AGs in the context of specific molecular
markers such as 1p/19q deletion. However, for recurrent AGs, there have been few advances in treatment options. Combination strategies appear to have the highest likelihood of improving outcome in this patient population, given the potential for targeting several aspects of tumor biology.
Angiogenesis inhibition constitutes a valid approach against malignant gliomas, which are highly vascular tumors,5 but
is considered to be mainly a cytostatic strategy. Hence, studies have examined the effect of the addition of DNA-damaging
agents to provide a cytotoxic signal to enhance the antitumor effect of antiangiogenic agents. Before the introduction of studies with bevacizumab, thalidomide was frequently used as an antiglioma agent for its antiangiogenic and immunomodulatory

effects6,7; however, this agent lacked single-agent activity
against malignant gliomas. Irinotecan, a topoisomerase II
inhibitor, has been used both as a single agent and in combination against malignant gliomas8-10; however, because it
lacked consistently demonstrable single-agent activity, it
has been considered as a reasonable cytotoxic backbone for
combination therapies against this tumor type.11,12
To test the hypothesis that the combination antiangiogenic activity of thalidomide and the cytotoxic effect of irinotecan would improve outcome in patients with recurrent
malignant glioma, we conducted an open-label phase 2
study of this combination with 2 separate arms involving
World Health Organization (WHO) grade IV and grade III
gliomas. The results of the arm with patients who had recurrent glioblastoma were previously reported and showed an
improvement in the progression-free survival rate at 6
months (PFS-6) compared with historical controls.13 Here,
we report the efficacy and toxicity of this combination in
the anaplastic glioma arm of the phase 2 study.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Eligibility
Adult patients (18 years) with a Karnofsky performance
status (KPS) score  70 and histologically proven WHO
grade III glioma (anaplastic astrocytoma [AA], anaplastic
oligodendroglioma [AO], or mixed anaplastic glioma
[AOA]) were enrolled in the study. Patients were required
to have disease progression documented by a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan obtained within 14 days of
study enrollment. All patients were required to have
received prior radiation therapy; treatment for up to 2 prior
progressions was allowed. Patients undergoing recent resection for recurrent tumor (including gross total resection)
were eligible; given that the primary endpoint was PFS-6,
neither measurable or evaluable tumor on neuroimaging
was required for study entry. Recovery from surgery and
any prior medical therapy for the tumor was required prior
to enrollment. Supportive therapy was allowed at the discretion of the treating physician. Treatment with enzymeinducing antiepileptic agents was not allowed, given the
potential for interaction with irinotecan. However, patients
whose anticonvulsant was changed to a non–enzymeinducing antiepileptic drug were eligible for entry after a 1week ‘‘washout’’ period.14 Adequate bone marrow function
as well as normal liver and kidney function, as documented
by serum laboratory values, were required.
Patients were required to provide informed consent
and to comply with the System for Thalidomide Educa-

3600

tion and Prescribing Safety Program (S.T.E.P.S.) developed by Celgene Corporation (Summit, NJ) to ensure
pregnancy testing, birth control, and education about thalidomide teratogenicity. Exclusion criteria included diagnosis of other cancers (unless in complete remission and
off therapy for at least 3 years) except for nonmelanoma
skin cancer and in situ carcinoma of the cervix. In addition, pregnant and lactating patients, patients with serious
medical conditions, patients with high-grade peripheral
neuropathy (grade 2 or higher), and patients previously
treated with irinotecan were excluded (prior treatment
with thalidomide was permitted). All patients provided
informed consent prior to entry into this protocol, which
was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the
University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center.
Treatment Plan
A treatment cycle was defined as 6 consecutive weeks of
treatment. Thalidomide was administered daily throughout the cycle starting at 100 mg/day for the first week and
was escalated weekly by 100 mg to a target dose of 400
mg/day provided it was tolerated well. Irinotecan was
administered at a dose of 125 mg/m2 by intravenous infusion over 90 minutes weekly for 4 weeks followed by a 2week rest period. Given the known thromboembolic risk
of thalidomide therapy, patients who were not already on
anticoagulants received low-dose warfarin therapy (1 mg
daily) as prophylaxis against thromboembolism. Dose
modification in subsequent cycles was dependent on toxicity which was graded according to the National Cancer
Institute Common Toxicity Criteria, version 3.0 (NCICTC); any toxicity graded 3 by these criteria required a
treatment hold for at least 2 weeks. Therapy was then
restarted at a lower dose once the toxicity resolved (reduction by 100 mg for thalidomide to a minimum of 100 mg
and 25 mg/m2 less per dose for irinotecan to a minimum
of 75 mg/m2). The agent selected for dose reduction was
dependent on the type of toxicity observed.
Study-Related Evaluations
A history and physical examination was performed at baseline and prior to every cycle. A complete blood count with
differential and platelet counts was performed at baseline
and repeated every 2 weeks. Serum chemistry was obtained
at baseline and repeated before each treatment cycle. A
brain MRI documenting tumor progression and a dynamic
contrast-enhanced MRI scan were obtained at baseline and
after each cycle of therapy. A quantitative sensory test was
performed at baseline on all patients and after every 2 cycles

for detection of early signs of peripheral neuropathy.
Women of reproductive age were required to have a pregnancy test before each treatment cycle. Prophylactic use of
colony-stimulating factor was not permitted.
Response Criteria
The primary endpoint of the study was PFS-6, defined
as the time interval between the date of registration and
the date of progression, irreversible neurological deterioration, or death while on study. On the basis of criteria
proposed by MacDonald et al,15 bidimensional measurement of the enhancing lesion was used to define radiological response; a partial response (PR) was defined as
>50% decrease of the baseline sum of measurable contrast-enhancing lesion with no new lesions present,
whereas a complete response (CR) required complete resolution of all contrast-enhancing lesions and absence of
any new lesions. Stable disease (SD) was defined as no
change on the MRI scan. Disease progression was
defined as >25% increase in the sum of all measurable
lesions, clear worsening of evaluable disease, or new
lesions. However, if neuroimaging data could not be
obtained, progression was defined by confirmed reports
of death or neurologic deterioration. Data from patients
in whom this information could not be obtained were
censored at the date of last follow-up.
Evaluation of Toxicity
Definition and grading of toxicity was according to the
NCI-CTC version 3. Toxicity was assessed on an
ongoing basis throughout the trial. When the trial

Cancer

accrued 50% of the total planned number of patients, an
interim analysis for toxicity was performed. Because no
unexpected or excessive toxicity was seen, the trial continued to full accrual.
Statistical Design
This open-label phase 2 study used a single-stage design,
and the results were compared with historical data
obtained from a database of 150 patients with recurrent
anaplastic gliomas.16 The hypothesis tested was H0: P <
P0 versus H1: P > P1, where P was the probability of
remaining alive and progression-free at 6 months, assuming an alpha (false positive rate)  10%, and beta (false
negative rate)  10%. The proportion of patients who
remained alive and progression-free at 6 months in the
historical population was 31%. Based on this, P0 was set
to 30% to discard a treatment that may be significantly
worse than the aggregate value from the control population, and P 1 was set to 50% (for an absolute improvement of 0.2 and a relative improvement of 1.7). These
parameters led to a 1-stage design with a total of 39
patients (declaring success if more than 15 patients had
PFS  6 months) with a false positive rate of 11% and
false negative rate of 9%. To accomplish the secondary
objectives, the distribution of time to progression or death
(PFS) and time to death were calculated with the KaplanMeier method. The proportion of patients in each of the
response categories (CR, PR, SD) as well as the response
rate (CR and PR) was also computed.

RESULTS
Patient Characteristics
Between November 2003 and October 2008, 42 patients
with AG were registered in this trial of whom 39 were
included in the final analysis, given that 3 had ineligible
histologies. Of these, 23 patients had AA and 13 had AO,
whereas the remaining 3 had other histologies. The
patients ranged in age from 20 to 73 years (median, 43
years) and had KPS ranging from 70-100 (median, 90).
The patient characteristics are indicated in Table 1.
Treatment Efficacy
Of the 39 eligible patients, 33 had disease progression at
the time of analysis with a Kaplan-Meier median PFS of
13 weeks (95% confidence interval [CI]: 6%, 28%) (Fig.
1A). The PFS-6 for the intent-to-treat population was
36% at 6 months (26 weeks) (95% CI: 21%, 53%). Fourteen patients were alive and progression-free at 6 months

from the time of registration to the study. Twenty-six
patients had died at the time of analysis. Kaplan-Meier median overall survival (OS) was 72 weeks (95% CI: 51
weeks, 144 weeks). OS was 74% at 6 months and 62% at 1
year (Fig. 1B). Clinical outcome for the whole cohort is

summarized for PFS and OS (Table 2). There were 23
patients with AA, 13 with AO, and 3 with other histologies.
Notably, median PFS was 14 weeks for AA and 11 weeks
for the others, but the difference was not significant (hazard
ratio ¼ 0.8; 95% CI: 0.4, 1.7; P ¼ 0.60). Median OS was
60 weeks among patients with AA and 82 weeks among
others (hazard ratio ¼ 1.2; 95% CI: 0.5, 2.6; P ¼ 0.71)
(Table 3). Best response was CR seen in 2 of 39 patients
(5.12%), PR in 2 of 39 patients (5.12%), SD in 18 of 39
patients (46.15%), and progressive disease in 15 of 39
patients (38.46%) (Fig. 2). The response rate (CRþPR)
was 4 of 39 patients (10%; 95% CI: 3%, 24%). Characteristics of patients with prolonged PFS are shown in Table 4.
Toxicity and Treatment Tolerance
All patients who received any duration of treatment were
assessed for toxicity. The most common toxicities in this
study included fatigue, hematological and gastrointestinal
events, and serum electrolyte disturbances. Patients who
experienced grade 3 or higher hematological toxicities
comprised 14 with leukopenia, 20 with neutropenia, 17
with lymphopenia, and 2 with thrombocytopenia (Table
5). Dose reduction was required in 7 patients due to severe
neutropenia, 3 with lymphopenia, and 3 with leukopenia.
One patient developed neutropenic fever and 1 developed
sepsis. Grade 3 or higher nonhematological toxicities
comprised fatigue in 18 patients, diarrhea in 9, constipation in 6, nausea and vomiting in 5, hypophosphatemia in
4, and hyponatremia in 3. Six patients had deep vein
thrombosis of whom 2 also had pulmonary embolism.
Grade 1 and 2 toxicities included nausea, dehydration,
dizziness, myelotoxicity, elevated aminotransferase levels,
and abnormal electrolyte levels. Four patients died of possible treatment-related causes: 1 had pulmonary embolism, 2 died after experiencing severe diarrhea and
dehydration likely related to irinotecan, and 1 died of urosepsis during treatment.

the tumor recurs is less evident.17 In patients with recurrent AGs (excluding AO) who were either chemotherapynaive or treated with nitrosourea-based regimens, temozolomide on a 5-day/28-day schedule showed activity, with
a PFS-6 of 46% and a median PFS of 5.4 months,18 establishing this as the standard of care. However, for

temozolomide-refractory AGs, there is no consensus
regarding optimal therapy; such patients are often appropriate candidates for clinical trials.
Angiogenesis inhibition offers a novel approach
against treatment-refractory malignant gliomas, which are
driven by neoangiogenesis and in combination with conventional chemotherapy has the potential to improve outcome in these patients.5 Although vascular proliferation is
not a histologic characteristic of AGs, unlike in glioblastoma, we hypothesized that the requirement of recurrent
AGs for neoangiogenesis would justify this approach in
patients with these tumors. A similar rationale was used

3604

by Short et al, who treated patients with recurrent highgrade glioma with single-agent thalidomide at a daily dose
of 100 mg and reported a PR rate of 6% and a median survival of 2.5 months from the start of treatment.6 Similarly, Fine et al also examined the effects of single-agent
thalidomide but at a much higher final dose of 1200 mg
daily, in patients with recurrent malignant gliomas
(WHO grade III and IV) and reported a PR rate of 6%
and SD rates of 33%; PFS data was not reported.7 Overall, results of these studies were considered indicative of
the limited activity of thalidomide as a single agent against
malignant gliomas.
Single-agent therapy with irinotecan also appeared
to have only modest efficacy against recurrent AGs.
Chamberlain et al reported that irinotecan as a single
agent had minimal activity in patients with temozolomide-refractory AGs; patients with recurrent AO with 1p/
19q deletion had a PFS-6 of 33%,19 whereas those with
recurrent AA had a comparatively better PFS-6 of 40%.8
In addition to demonstrating the minimal efficacy of irinotecan in these patients, the results also suggest that, despite their possible prognostic role in newly diagnosed
AGs, markers such as 1p/19q deletion may not predict
treatment response in the recurrent setting, although this
requires further confirmation given some reports to the
contrary in temozolomide-naive recurrent gliomas.20
Combination strategies using thalidomide and cytotoxic agents have been reported in high-grade gliomas,
but the limited number of patients with AG included in
these studies makes it difficult to assess their efficacy.21 To
address this deficiency, our study included separate arms

Cancer

Irinotecan and Thalidomide Against Anaplastic Glioma/Giglio et al

for grade III and IV gliomas. We previously reported the
results of the glioblastoma arm in which the combination
of irinotecan and thalidomide showed promising activity
with improvement of PFS-6 compared with historical
controls.13 Here, we examined the activity of the combination in the AG arm of the study in adults with recurrent
tumor. In this study, 14 patients were alive and progression-free at 6 months with an overall PFS-6 in the intentto-treat population of 36%; the study hence did not meet
its primary endpoint, because these results were below the
protocol-specified limits for declaring success. The median OS of 61 weeks seen in this study is better than historically reported values of 39 to 47 weeks for WHO
grade III gliomas; however, the improved survival cannot
be reliably attributed to the regimen used given that the
majority of our patients were treated with other regimens,
including other chemotherapeutic agents or reirradiation.
Various combination chemotherapy regimens have
been tested in the recurrent AG patient population. In an
approach similar to the one reported in this study, Kesari et
al reported a median PFS of 14 weeks, PFS-6 of 26%, and
median OS of 41.5 weeks in a subset of patients with recurrent AG treated with a metronomic chemotherapy combination regimen consisting of 2 oral cytotoxic
(cyclophosphamide and etoposide) and 2 antiangiogenic
(thalidomide and celecoxib) agents.22 In addition, a PFS-6
of 44% and median PFS and OS of 24.5 weeks and 54
weeks, respectively, were reported by Walbert et al in the
subset of patients with recurrent AG who were treated with
6-thioguanine, lomustine (or temozolomide), celecoxib,
and capecitabine and was considered promising for treatment of AGs.23 The combination of imatinib and hydroxyurea yielded a PFS-6 of 24% in temozolomide-refractory
patients with AGs.24 A PFS-6 of 24% and a median survival
of 43 weeks were reported in a study using poly-ICLC (carboxymethylcellulose, polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid, and
poly-L-lysine double-stranded RNA), an immune modulator, in patients with AGs, with the authors concluding that
the agent was ineffective against this disease.25 In a phase 2
study of irinotecan and carmustine in malignant gliomas,
the median time to progression was 16.9 weeks and the median OS was an unexpectedly low 25.7 weeks (likely due to
the small patient number and 2 early deaths) for recurrent
AA and AO.26 Overall, these combination regimens yielded
a PFS-6 of 24% to 44% of patients with recurrent AGs.
Bevacizumab, which is approved for treatment of
recurrent glioblastoma, has also been tested in AGs, either
as a single agent or in combinations; various previous
studies have reported radiographic response rates ranging

Cancer

July 15, 2012

from 31% to 67%,27-29 PFS-6 rates of 32% to 68%,27,29and median OS of 9.1 to 16 months.29,31-33 Although
these results appear superior compared with other regimens, it is uncertain whether the results represent true
response and PFS rates, considering bevacizumab can
induce alteration of the permeability of the blood–brain
barrier and be associated with nonenhancing progressions.
The most frequent adverse effects seen in this study
were myelotoxicity, gastrointestinal disturbances, and fatigue, which are expected toxicities of the agents used.
Notably, 15.4% (6 of 39 patients) of the patients experienced thromboembolism despite the protocol-mandated
requirement for low-dose warfarin.34,35 The frequency of
venous thromboembolism in this study was comparatively lower than the 24% to 26% reported in other studies,36,37 suggesting that low-dose warfarin may have a
protective effect against venous thromboembolism in this
population. Furthermore, the use of warfarin was not
associated with symptomatic or asymptomatic intracranial or intratumoral bleeding.
The PFS-6 and OS noted in this study suggest modest activity for this combination in unselected patients
with WHO grade III gliomas, which although better than
historical controls, did not meet the statistical threshold to
declare this drug combination of sufficient promise to
warrant additional testing in a larger sample size, especially
given the significant adverse events noted. However, several patients experienced prolonged PFS and OS, suggesting that a subset of patients may derive significant benefit
from this regimen, although initial identification of such a
subset is challenging. This regimen could provide another
salvage option for treatment of patients with WHO grade
III gliomas who have exhausted standard treatment
options but who remain candidates for additional therapies. We are currently conducting a phase 1/2 trial of irinotecan combined with lenalidomide, a thalidomide
analogue, in patients with WHO grade III and IV gliomas. Given the higher potency of lenalidomide seen in
preclinical studies, we anticipate a better clinical efficacy
of this combination in both grades of malignant gliomas.
