Y-DOTA]-Tyr -octreotide (TOC) in advanced iodine-refractory thyroid cancer.

METHODS: In a phase 2 trial, the authors investigated biochemical response (assessed by serum thyroglobulin levels), survival, and the long-term safety profile of systemic [90Y-DOTA]-TOC treatment in metastasized iodine-refractory thyroid cancer. Adverse events were assessed according to the National Cancer
Institute criteria. Survival analyses were performed by using multiple regression models. RESULTS: A total
of 24 patients were enrolled. A median cumulative activity of 13.0 GBq (range, 1.7-30.3 GBq) was administered. Response was found in 7 (29.2%) patients. Eight (33.3%) patients developed hematologic toxicity
grade 1-3, and 4 (16.7%) patients developed renal toxicity grade 1-4. The median survival was 33.4 months
(range, 3.6-126.8 months) from time of diagnosis and 16.8 months (range, 1.8-99.1 months) from time of first
[90Y-DOTA]-TOC treatment. Response to treatment was associated with longer survival from time of
diagnosis (hazard ratio [HR], 0.17; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.03-0.92; P ¼ .04) and from time of first
[90Y-DOTA]-TOC therapy (HR, 0.20; 95% CI, 0.04-0.94; P ¼ .04). The visual grade of scintigraphic tumor
uptake was not associated with treatment response (odds ratio [OR], 0.98; 95% CI, 0.26-3.14; P ¼ 1.00).
CONCLUSIONS: Response to [90Y-DOTA]-TOC in metastasized iodine-refractory thyroid cancer was associated with longer survival. Upcoming trials should aim to increase the number of treatment cycles. Cancer

DOTATOC in Iodine Refractory Thyroid Cancer/Iten et al

Differentiated thyroid cancer is the most frequent
1

endocrine malignancy. Its standard treatment includes
surgery and radioiodine. The expected survival after full
remission is more than 40 years.2 However, no therapy is
established in case of dedifferentiation,3 and the median
survival is only about 3 years after loss of iodine avidity.2
Treatment with carboplatin, cisplatin, doxorubicin, epirubicin, or combined regimes has shown only rare responses
with life-threatening toxicity or even drug-related death,4-6
whereas promising results have recently been reported
with the use of tyrosine kinase inhibitors.7
Systemic treatment with the 90Yttrium (90Y)
labeled, 1,4,7,10-tetra-azacyclododecane N,N0 ,N00 ,N000 tetraacetic acid (DOTA) modified somatostatin analog
Tyr3-octreotide (TOC) was introduced in 1998.8 [90YDOTA]-TOC is administered intravenously and binds to
the somatostatin receptor subtype 2 on the surface of the
tumor cell, where it exerts its cytotoxic effects by b-irradiation. The treatment has moderate hematologic and
nephrologic toxicity and has developed into a promising
therapeutic tool for tumors expressing its target receptor.9-13 Among other endocrine tumors, iodine-refractory
thyroid cancers express the somatostatin receptor subtype
2, and pilot studies have provided proof of principle that
[90Y-DOTA]-TOC can achieve remissions in progressive
iodine-refractory thyroid cancer.14,15 Nevertheless, the
long-term benefit and the safety profile have remained
elusive.
Herein, we investigated the long-term efficacy and
toxicity of [90Y-DOTA]-TOC in iodine-refractory thyroid cancer.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Trial Design
In a clinical phase 2, single-center, open-label trial, we
investigated response, survival, and the safety profile of
[90Y-DOTA]-TOC treatment in progressive iodinerefractory thyroid cancer. Adverse events were assessed
according to the National Cancer Institute criteria. Predictors for survival were examined among the participant’s baseline characteristics and the cumulative applied
therapeutic dose. The study was designed and carried out
in accordance with good clinical practice guidelines, Swiss
drug laws, and the Declaration of Helsinki. The study was
Cancer

May 15, 2009

approved by the local ethics committee for human studies
(EKBB-Reference-No.: M120 of 97; www.ekbb.ch), and
written informed consent was obtained from all
participants.

Trial Cohort
We consecutively included patients with 1) status after
total thyroidectomy and the initial histological diagnosis
of differentiated thyroid cancer that 2) consecutively
failed to respond to standard therapy including radioiodine, 3) stage IVc disease by definition of the American
Joint Committee on Cancer, ie, occurrence of distant
metastases, as confirmed by histology or iodine avidity in
the initial intratherapeutic radioiodine scans, 4) measurable serum thyroglobulin levels with negative antithyroglobulin antibodies, 5) disease progression within 12 months
before study entry as defined by increasing thyroglobulin
levels, and 6) visible tumor uptake in the pretherapeutic
somatostatin receptor subtype 2 scintigraphy (111InOctreoscan). We excluded patients with 1) age younger
than 18 years, 2) concurrent antitumor treatment, 3) secondary malignancies, 4) pregnancy, 5) breast-feeding,
6) incontinence, 7) severe concomitant illness including
severe psychiatric disorders, or 8) reduced kidney
function, assessed by creatinine clearance according to
Cockcroft-Gault.16 The age-related normal ranges for
creatinine clearance were derived from the Guidelines of
the National Kidney Foundation (www.kidney.org).

Pretherapeutic Somatostatin Receptor
Subtype 2 Scintigraphy
Pretherapeutic imaging was performed by using 111Inpentetreotide (Octreoscan, Mallinckrodt, St. Louis, Mo)
as previously described.17 For this study, anterior and posterior planar whole-body images as well as planar spot
images of the target lesion were acquired and interpreted.
Thereby, the intensity of uptake in the tumor site with the
strongest tracer accumulation was visually graded by a
panel of 2 board-certified, nuclear-medicine physicians
(H. R. and J. M. B.) blinded to the patients’ characteristics. Uptake was graded by using a 4-point scale as follows:
0, no uptake present; 1, uptake present but lower than
liver uptake; 2, similar to liver uptake; and 3, higher than
liver uptake.

Therapeutic Radiopeptide
DOTA-TOC was synthesized in a 5-step synthetic procedure according to Good Laboratory Practice as previously
described.8-10 For radiolabeling, kits containing 220 lg
DOTA-TOC, 18.3 mg ascorbic acid, and 160 mg sodium
ascorbate were labeled with 3.7 GBq/m2 body surface 90Y
(b-emission for therapeutic purposes; Perkin Elmer Life
Sciences, Boston, Mass), and 0.111 GBq 111Indium chloride (111In-Cl, c-emission for intratherapeutic imaging;
Mallinckrodt Medical, Petten, Netherlands). The solution was heated at 95 C for 25 minutes, and quality
control was performed by using solid-phase extraction
(Sep-PakC18 cartridge; Waters Associates, Milford,
Mass) and high performance liquid chromatography,
with a minimum required labeling purity >99.5%.
Radiopeptide Treatment
A fractionated treatment protocol was performed with intravenous injections of 3.7 GBq/m2 body surface [90YDOTA]-TOC per cycle as previously described.8-10 For
each cycle, patients were hospitalized for 3 days in accordance with the local Swiss requirements for legal radiation
protection. An infusion of 2000 mL of Hartmann-Hepa
8%-aminoacid solution (Ringer Lactate Hartmann, Proteinsteril Hepa 8%, Mg 5-Sulfat) was started 30 minutes
before and continued until 3 hours after the injection of
the radiopeptide to inhibit the tubular reabsorption of
the radioactive tracer. Repeated treatment cycles were
intended in case of response within 10 weeks after treatment, except in case of renal toxicity, loss of patient transferability, or denial of further treatment. Conversely,
further cycles were withheld in case of absent response,
except in patients that described a significant gain in quality of life after therapy. In addition, thyroxin to maintain
absolute thyrotropin suppression was administered on a
daily basis and was continued during [90Y-DOTA]-TOC
treatment and thyroglobulin measurements.
Intratherapeutic Imaging
Planar imaging was performed with a dual-head Picker
Prism 2000 XP camera (Philips, Eindhoven, Netherlands)
using parallel-hole, medium-energy, general-purpose collimators. The windows were centered over both 111Indium photon peaks (245 and 172 keV) with a window
2054

width of 20%. Whole-body scans (acquisition time, 15
minutes) and spot images (acquisition time, 10 minutes)
were obtained 24 and 48 hours after application of the
radionuclide.

Follow-up
Vital signs were monitored before and for 72 hours after
each infusion. Blood chemistry parameters (including
serum thyroglobulin under thyroid-stimulating hormone
[TSH] suppression and creatinine levels) and hematologic
parameters (including leukocytes, platelet counts, and
serum hemoglobin levels) were measured before each
treatment cycle and in at biweekly intervals until 10 weeks
after each cycle or normalization of marker levels, respectively. All observed toxicities were recorded continuously. Acute and long-term adverse events were graded
according to the Common Terminology Criteria for
Adverse Events, version 3.0, (http://ctep.cancer.gov/
forms/ CTCAEv3.pdf) of the National Cancer Institute
as follows: 1) Nausea, grade 1: nausea or loss of appetite
without alteration in eating habits; grade 2: oral intake
decreased without significant weight loss, dehydration, or
malnutrition with intravenous fluids indicated <24
hours; grade 3: inadequate oral caloric or fluid intake,
intravenous fluids, tube feedings, or total parenteral nutrition [TPN] indicated 24 hours; grade 4: life-threatening
consequences; grade 5: death. 2) Leucopenia (leukocytes
109/L), grade 1: 3.5-3.0; grade 2: 3.0-2.0; grade 3: 2.01.0; grade 4: <1.0; grade 5: death. 3) Thrombopenia (platelets 109/L), grade 1: 150.0-75.0; grade 2: 75.0-50.0;
grade 3: 50.0-25.0; grade 4: <25.0; grade 5: death. 4)
Anemia (hemoglobin g/dL), grade 1: 14.0-10.0; grade 2:
10.0-8.0; grade 3: 8.0-6.5; grade 4: <6.5; grade 5: death.
5) Renal adverse event (creatinine clearance L/min/
1.73 m2), grade 1: <75%-50% of lower limit of the
norm; grade 2: <50%-25% of lower limit of the norm;
grade 3: <25% of lower limit of the norm and chronic
dialysis not indicated; grade 4: chronic dialysis or renal
transplant indicated; grade 5: death.

Endpoints
Primary endpoints were treatment response and toxicity;
the secondary endpoint was overall survival. As only
patients with increasing thyroglobulin levels had been
Cancer

DOTATOC in Iodine Refractory Thyroid Cancer/Iten et al

enrolled, response was defined as decreasing thyroglobulin levels after therapy. The overall response rate was
defined as the number of participants with response
divided by the total number of participants on the basis of
intention-to-treat, whereas loss of follow-up was regarded
as treatment failure. Overall survival was assessed for both
time of diagnosis and time of first [90Y-DOTA]-TOC
treatment, respectively, to death from any cause. When
death did not occur during the observation period, the
survival time was censored at the last date a patient was
known to be alive.

Statistical Analysis
The baseline characteristics of responders and nonresponders to [90Y-DOTA]-TOC were compared by using
the chi-square test and Kruskal-Wallis 1-way analysis of
variance, as appropriate. Discrete variables are summarized by counts (percentages) and continuous variables by
their median (range), unless stated otherwise. The influence of different variables on the response to [90YDOTA]-TOC was assessed by using simple logistic
regression models, and the corresponding effect estimates
were expressed as odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals. Predictors of survival from both time of diagnosis
and time of first [90Y-DOTA]-TOC treatment were initially assessed by using simple proportional hazard models. Subsequently, backward selection from an initial
multiple proportional hazard model including age,
response, and all other previously significant variables led
us to our final model. The corresponding effect estimates
were expressed as hazard ratios with 95% confidence
intervals. For quantitative covariates (eg, baseline thyroglobulin, baseline serum creatinine clearance, cumulative
activity of [90Y-DOTA]-TOC), we assessed whether the
variable itself or its logarithmic transform was more
strongly associated with the outcome variable. For all endpoints, sensitivity analyses were performed in the subsets
of responders and nonresponders to [90Y-DOTA]-TOC.
Time-to event data were plotted by using Kaplan-Meier
curves. The use of thyroglobulin doubling time has
recently been reported in iodine-refractory thyroid cancer.18 We explored the effect of [90Y-DOTA]-TOC on
the thyroglobulin doubling time by calculating the ratio
of pretherapeutic (last measurement before treatment and
measurement at day of treatment) and post-therapeutic

(measurement at day of treatment and lowest value during
10 weeks post-treatment) thyroglobulin doubling time.
All P values are 2-sided, and P values of <.05 were considered to be statistically significant. Data were analyzed (by
C. S. and M. A. W.) by using Statistica V.6.0 software for
Windows (StatSoft, Tulsa, Okla) and SAS release 9.1
(SAS Institute, Cary, NC).

RESULTS
Patients
Between October 1997 and October 2006, 31 patients
were screened for eligibility. Of these, 4 (12.9%) patients
were not enrolled because of absent tumor uptake at
pretherapeutic scintigraphy, whereas 3 (9.7%) patients
declined participation. The remaining 24 (77.4%)
patients were recruited (Fig. 1). Twenty-three of these
patients had previously received a cumulative number of
59 cycles of radioiodine (1-7 cycles per patient). The participants were transferred from Germany (n ¼ 17), Switzerland (n ¼ 3), France (n ¼ 1), Italy (n ¼ 1), Hungary

Treatment Response
A total of 58 cycles of [90Y-DOTA]-TOC (1 to 4 cycles
per patient) were performed with a median cumulative
activity of 13.0 GBq (range, 5.6-30.3 GBq). Intratherapeutic scintigraphy revealed visual scintigraphic tumor
uptake grade 3 in 7 (29.2%) patients (Fig. 2). A general
increase in thyroglobulin doubling time from 5.0  15.7
months before treatment to 50.7  307.0 months after
treatment was found for the entire cohort. Decreasing
thyroglobulin levels upon treatment with [90Y-DOTA]TOC were found in 7 (29.2%) participants (Fig. 3). In
these responders, the median reduction of serum thyroglobulin was 48.9% (range, 0.3%-54.5%), whereas in the
nonresponders, the median increase of serum thyroglobulin was 36.8% (range, 2.6%-4912.8%). The 7 responders
and the 17 nonresponders displayed comparable baseline
criteria, including the visual grade of tumor uptake in the
pretherapeutic 111In-Octreoscan (Table 1). Multiple
regression analyses did not reveal any significant pretherapeutic predictor of treatment response (Table 2). In the 7
responders, treatment was subsequently withheld after a
total of 1 (1 case), 2 (2 cases), 3 (1 case) or 4 (3 cases)
cycles for lack of further response (6 cases, 85.7%) or kidney toxicity (1 case, 14.3%). In addition, 5 patients

At the end of follow-up, 17 (70.8%) participants had
died, and 6 (25.0%) had survived. The median follow-up
in these patients was 14.9 months (range, 1.8-99.1
months). One (4.2%) patient was lost to follow-up 1
month after [90Y-DOTA]-TOC therapy. The median
survival was 33.4 months (range, 3.6-126.8 months) from
time of diagnosis and 16.8 months (range, 1.8-99.1
months) from time of first [90Y-DOTA]-TOC treatment.
Responders had a significantly longer median survival
than nonresponders, from time of diagnosis (65.1 months
[range, 18.8-126.8 months] vs 28.9 months [range, 3.671.6 months]; P ¼ .04; Fig. 4A) and time of [90YDOTA]-TOC treatment (42.4 months [range, 8.0-99.1
months] vs 13.7 months [range, 1.8-47.6]; P ¼ .04; Fig.
4B). Thus, the survival from diagnosis in responders was
1.8 times longer than that of patients with iodine-negative
thyroid cancers in the largest cohort yet reported.19 When
including the 5 clinical responses, all responders had a significantly longer median survival compared with nonresponders, from time of initial diagnosis (56.1 months
[range, 13.1-126.8 months] vs 28.9 months [range, 3.660.9 months]; P ¼ .03), and there was a trend toward longer survival from time of [90Y-DOTA]-TOC treatment
(29.5 months [range, 7.8-99.1 months] vs 13.7 months
[range, 1.8-47.6]; P ¼ .10). There was no significant

In the our trial, response to [90Y-DOTA]-TOC in metastasized iodine-negative thyroid cancer was associated
with a longer survival from time of diagnosis and time of
treatment, respectively.
[90Y-DOTA]-TOC therapy of iodine-refractory
thyroid cancer had previously been described by 2 pilot
studies.14,15 Both reported response rates comparable to
ours; however, their cohort sizes and extent of follow-up
were underpowered to obtain results on survival and its

predictors. The present results, however, encourage intensifying treatment in responders to the first cycle, especially
when considering the relatively low toxicity of [90YDOTA]-TOC.
Toxicity had limited previous approaches of systemic therapy in metastasized iodine-refractory thyroid
cancer. Single-agent chemotherapy has shown severe toxicities with few responses and no indicators of a long-term
survival benefit,4-6 whereas combination chemotherapy
and the addition of surgery and radiotherapy are able to
improve local control, especially in early stages of disease.20-22 Nevertheless, promising results have recently
been reported with the use of tyrosine kinase inhibitors.7
Similar to previous trials on [90Y-DOTA]-TOC,9-12 we
found considerably less hematologic toxicity compared
with those reported in studies that used conventional
chemotherapy.
Renal toxicity is caused by elevated renal uptake and
prolonged retention of radiolabeled peptides, and it generally is the dose-limiting toxicity in radiopeptide therapy.23 Therefore, several techniques have been attempted
to reduce renal uptake, including concurrent application
of dimercaptosuccinic acid,24 amifostin,25 and amino
acid solutions,26 specifically lysine  arginine.27 In the
present trial, renal toxicity occurred in 4 participants
despite the use of amino acid solutions, indicating the
need for intensified research in this field. Nevertheless, in
our cohort, kidney toxicity was not a risk factor of survival
after [90Y-DOTA]-TOC treatment. These results encour2060

age intensifying treatment, especially when a good baseline renal function is present.
Reliable predictors for response to [90Y-DOTA]TOC are lacking. Pretherapeutic scintigraphy is commonly used to observe tumor uptake28 and select cases
in which successful treatment is anticipated. Accordingly,
we enrolled only patients with visible tumor uptake.
Multiple regression analyses, however, revealed no statistically significant association between pretherapeutic tumor
uptake and the clinical endpoints response and survival,
respectively. Importantly, in each patient, only the tumor

with the strongest tracer accumulation was scored. The
survival, however, might have depended on less differentiated metastases with lower uptake. Therefore, upcoming
trials of positron emission tomography with [68GaDOTA]-TOC to quantify somatostatin analog binding in
all tumor sites are warranted.
A present, morphologic imaging represents the gold
standard in treatment monitoring of most malignancies;
however, tumor-specific properties are not considered,
and recent reports suggest that biomarkers may facilitate
more sensitive response readouts.29-31 As in our study, serum thyroglobulin levels have previously been used as a
response evaluation criterion.32 As the circulating levels of
thyroglobulin are closely related to the concentrations of
thyrotropin, all patients continued their suppressive
thyroxine dose during [90Y-DOTA]-TOC therapy.
Our trial has strengths and limitations. First, the
number of participants and their follow-up had sufficient
statistical power to obtain significant results on prediction
of survival. Nevertheless, they were derived from a single
cohort and need independent confirmation to assure
external validity. Second, regarding baseline criteria, our
cohort represents a wide range of clinical manifestations
of iodine-refractory thyroid cancer. Therefore, we used
multiple regression models and corrected all analyses for
these factors. Furthermore, all survival analyses were performed for both periods, time from diagnosis and from
treatment, respectively. Third, statistical association does
not prove causality. Factors other than successful treatment might have been responsible for the extended survival of treatment responders within this phase 2 clinical
trial. A phase 3 placebo-controlled, randomized clinical
trial is necessary to confirm a survival benefit. Finally, we
were not able to define pretherapeutic markers for posttherapeutic response. The discovery of predictors remains
preserved for upcoming trials. Further trials may also be
warranted to investigate the effect of other radiometals,
including 177Lu and other somatostatin-based radiopeptides such as DOTA-TATE33 and radiolabeled somatostatin antagonists,34 on the survival of iodine-refractory
thyroid cancer patients.
In conclusion, [90Y-DOTA]-TOC therapy has the
potential to develop into a useful tool for treating metastasized iodine-refractory thyroid cancer. A randomized
phase 3 clinical trial, however, is warranted to confirm
these results. Our results indicate that this trial should
