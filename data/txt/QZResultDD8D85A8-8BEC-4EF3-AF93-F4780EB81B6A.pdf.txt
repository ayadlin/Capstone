Autophagy is required for cell survival under
L-asparaginase-induced metabolic stress in acute
lymphoblastic leukemia cells
H Takahashi1,2,3, J Inoue1,3, K Sakaguchi2, M Takagi4, S Mizutani4 and J Inazawa1,3
L-asparaginase has been used for more than three decades in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) patients and remains an essential
drug in the treatment of ALL. Poor response to L-asparaginase is associated with increased risk of therapeutic failure in ALL.
However, both the metabolic perturbation and molecular context of L-asparaginase-treated ALL cells has not been fully elucidated.
Here we identify that treatment with L-asparaginase results in metabolic shutdown via the reduction of both glycolysis and
oxidative phosphorylation, accompanied by mitochondrial damage and activation of autophagy. The autophagy is involved in
reducing reactive oxygen species (ROS) level by eliminating injured mitochondria. Inhibition of autophagy enhances
L-asparaginase-induced cytotoxicity and overcomes the acquired resistance to L-asparaginase in ALL cells. The ROS-p53-positive
feedback loop is an essential mechanism of this synergistic cytotoxicity. Thus, our ﬁndings provide the rationale for the future
development of combined treatment of L-asparaginase and anti-autophagy drug in ALL patients.

INTRODUCTION
Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is the most common type of
childhood cancer.1 Although treatment outcomes have been
remarkably improved by the development of effective therapies
and well-designed protocols, ~ 20% of pediatric patients develop
resistance to therapy and eventually relapse, often leading to
death.1,2 L-asparaginase (L-asp), one of the most important drugs
used for childhood ALL therapy, is an enzyme that catalyzes the
hydrolysis of asparagine (Asn) or glutamine (Gln) to aspartic acid
or glutamic acid, respectively.3 Poor response to L-asp is
associated with increased risk of relapse and therapeutic
failure.4,5 It has been proposed that the sensitivity of ALL to
L-asp is due to low or absent expression of asparagine
synthetase.6–8 However, genome-wide expression proﬁling of
ALL patient samples showed conﬂicting results,9–11 and basal
asparagine synthetase expression was shown to have no clinical
signiﬁcance in ALL patients.12 Thus, despite long-standing
experience with L-asp therapy, both the metabolic perturbation
and molecular context of L-asp-treated ALL cells remains to be
fully elucidated.
One of the major cellular responses to amino-acid depletion is
the induction of autophagy. Autophagy is a degradation process
of proteins and organelles, which can provide metabolic
intermediates such as amino acids, and can also reduce reactive
oxygen species (ROS)-mediated oxidative stress by eliminating
damaged mitochondria.13 Some anticancer drugs can induce
cytoprotective autophagy,14 and several clinical trials using
combined treatment of existing anticancer drugs and the
lysosomal inhibitor chloroquine (CQ) are currently ongoing.15
Treatment with L-asp can also induce cytoprotective autophagy in

human cancers.16–18 However, the biological signiﬁcance of L-aspinduced autophagy or the effect of autophagy inhibition in L-asptreated cells remains largely unknown. In this study, we sought to
reveal how L-asp affects cellular processes in ALL cells, and to
elucidate the implication of L-asp-induced autophagy in hopes of
obtaining insight into alternative strategies for ALL therapy.
RESULTS
L-asp treatment induces metabolic shutdown and mitochondrial
injury in ALL cells
We ﬁrst conﬁrmed that intracellular Asn and Gln were immediately
depleted in REH cells during L-asp treatment (Figure 1a). To
understand the physiological effect of L-asp treatment, we next
performed the gene expression array of L-asp-treated REH cells,
accompanied by gene ontology (GO) analysis using Database for
Annotation, Visualization, and Integrated Discovery (DAVID)19 and
gene set enrichment analysis.20 The expression levels of genes
associated with several cellular metabolic pathways, including
glycolysis, tricarboxylic acid cycle and oxidative phosphorylation,
were signiﬁcantly lower in L-asp-treated REH cells than in
untreated cells (Figures 1b and c and Supplementary Table S2).
Decreased expression levels of these metabolism-related
genes were also conﬁrmed in two ALL cell lines, REH and 697,
by qRT–PCR (Figure 1d and Supplementary Figure S1). These
ﬁndings were consistent with the decrease of intracellular ATP
level (Figure 1a) and the result from the energy metabolism
analysis using the XF24 extracellular ﬂux analyzer; basal levels of
both the oxygen consumption rate (OCR) for oxidative phosphorylation in the mitochondria and the extracellular acidiﬁcation rate

(ECAR) for glycolysis were remarkably lower in L-asp-treated cells
than in untreated cells (Figure 1e), suggesting that L-asp
treatment effectively induces metabolic shutdown in ALL cells.
In a mitochondrial stress test, treatment with oligomycin, an FoATPase inhibitor of Complex V, clearly reduced mitochondrial
respiration in L-asp-treated and untreated cells. However, spare
respiratory capacity (deﬁned as the quantitative difference
between maximal OCR after addition of mitochondrial oxidative
phosphorylation uncoupler carbonyl cyanide 4-(triﬂuoromethoxy)
phenylhydrazone and the initial basal OCR) in L-asp-treated cells
was signiﬁcantly lower than in untreated cells (Figure 1f). These
data suggested that L-asp treatment induces metabolic shutdown
accompanied by reduction of both glycolysis and oxidative
phosphorylation, and mitochondrial function is heavily impaired
in L-asp-treated cells.

L-asp-induced autophagy is involved in reducing ROS level by
eliminating injured mitochondria
To investigate whether L-asp treatment induced autophagy in ALL
cells, we next evaluated autophagy ﬂux in ALL cells by detection
of LC3B form-II (LC3B-II), an autophagosome marker.21 By western
blotting, LC3B-II levels were observed to be increased by L-asp
treatment, and this increase was signiﬁcantly enhanced by
inhibiting autophagosome turnover via the addition of a
lysosomal inhibitor, CQ or baﬁlomycin A1 (Baf; Figure 2a and
Supplementary Figure S2A). In immunoﬂuorescence analysis,
LC3B-positive autophagic puncta were observed in L-asp-treated
REH cells, and the number of these puncta was remarkably
increased by the addition of CQ (Figure 2b). Moreover, electron
microscopic analysis revealed that both the number and area
of autophagic vacuoles per cell were signiﬁcantly increased in

(d) Mitochondrial membrane potential assay with TMRE. Fluorescence intensity was measured using ﬂow cytometry. (e) Measurement of
intracellular and mitochondrial ROS level. Treated REH cells were stained with 10 μM of DCFDA (intracellular ROS) or 2.5 μM of MitoSox
(mitochondrial ROS). REH cells were treated with 1 U/ml of L-asp for 48 h and/or 10 μM of CQ for the last 3 h (a–d) or for 48 h (d, e). Data in a, c–e
represent as mean ± s.d. (n = 3); *Po0.05, ***Po0.001. P-values were calculated using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA).

L-asp-treated REH cells, and these increases were clearly enhanced
by addition of CQ (Figure 2c). These ﬁndings suggest that L-asp
treatment can induce autophagy in ALL cells.
Furthermore, intracellular amino-acid proﬁles revealed that
both Asn and Gln levels rapidly decreased after L-asp treatment;
however, the rate of decrease of these amino acids in the L-asptreated cells did not signiﬁcantly differ between cells treated with
or without CQ (Supplementary Figure S2B), suggesting that
autophagy might not contribute to supply a detectable amount
of these amino acids. In contrast, the feature of mitochondrial
injury such as the decreased mitochondrial membrane potential
(Ψm) and the increase in both intracellular and mitochondrial ROS
levels were remarkably enhanced autophagy-inhibited REH cells
during L-asp treatment (Figures 2d and e and Supplementary
Figures S2C–E). In addition, L-asp treatment signiﬁcantly induced a
decrease in the amount of mitochondrial DNA and mitochondrial
mass (Supplementary Figures S2F and G). Taken together, these
data suggested that L-asp-induced autophagy functions predominantly in mitochondrial quality control rather than in recycling
intracellular amino acids. Autophagy inhibition enhances the

cytotoxicity of L-asparaginase treatment. We then examined the
effect of autophagy inhibition on L-asp-induced cytotoxicity in
ALL cell lines. When autophagic degradation was pharmacologically inhibited by treatment with CQ simultaneously with L-asp
treatment, the number of dead cells remarkably increased
compared to L-asp alone (Figure 3a). Apoptotic cells, indicated
by increased levels of cleaved caspase-3 and cleaved PARP, were
clearly detected with combined treatment of L-asp and CQ
(Figure 3b). For cell cycle analysis, the treatment with L-asp alone
induced cell cycle arrest at the G1 phase, consistent with a
previous report,22 and the combined treatment with CQ and L-asp
signiﬁcantly increased the sub-G1 population (Supplementary
Figure S3A). Concurrent treatment with the caspase inhibitor
zVAD-fmk inhibited the induction of cell death by combined
treatment of L-asp and CQ (Supplementary Figure S3B). Treatment
of ALL cells with L-asp showed signiﬁcantly synergistic antileukemic effects in combination with autophagy inhibition using CQ
(combination index at the IC50 = 0.515 in REH cells and 0.686 in
697 cells; Supplementary Figure S3C). We next investigated the
effect of prolonged treatment exposure with L-asp. Almost all cells

treated with the combination of L-asp and CQ died after 6–9 days,
whereas cells treated with L-asp or CQ alone remained viable and
continued to slowly proliferate during treatment (Figure 3c). This
combined effect was also observed when autophagy was
inhibited by small interference RNA (siRNA)-mediated knockdown
of the essential autophagy genes including ATG7, ATG5 and BECN1
(Beclin1; Figure 3d and Supplementary Figure S3D). Furthermore,
we examined the inhibitory effect of autophagy process at the
early stage by treatment with 3MA or at the late stage by
treatment with ALLN, a cathepsin inhibitor. As the result, the clear
synergistic effect was shown in both combined treatment,
suggesting that blocking autophagy ﬂux can enhance L-aspinduced toxicity in ALL cells (Supplementary Figures S3E and F).
Particularly, the synergistic effect by CQ treatment was not shown
in the cells whose autophagy was clearly inhibited by treatment
with 3MA (Supplementary Figure S3G), suggesting that CQmediated sensitization is dependent on inhibiting autophagy. To
test whether autophagy inhibition can overcome the resistance to
L-asp treatment, we generated the acquired resistant cells from
697 cells by prolonged exposure to L-asp (parental 697 cells;
IC50 = 0.74 and 697-R cells, a resistant 697 cell; IC50 = 2.4;

Figure 3e). Combined treatment of L-asp and CQ induced
signiﬁcant cell death, including in 697-R cells (Figure 3f).
Importantly, LC3B-II levels were increased in 697-R cells more
than in parental 697 cells by L-asp treatment, and this increase
was signiﬁcantly enhanced by CQ treatment, suggesting that the
activity of L-asp-induced autophagy in 697-R cells was higher than
that of the parental 697 cells (Figure 3g). Thus, these ﬁndings
suggest that autophagy inhibition may be a useful strategy to
overcome L-asp resistance. Combination treatment of L-asp and
chloroquine suppresses leukemia growth in vivo. To examine the
therapeutic potential of the combined treatment using an in vivo
ALL xenograft model, REH cells stably expressing luciferase (REHLuc2) were injected into the tail vein of non-obese diabetic/severe
combined immunodeﬁcient mice. Quantiﬁcation of leukemiaassociated bioluminescence at 7 days after transplantation
demonstrated no signiﬁcant differences among the four treatment groups (Figure 4a). The mice then received daily intraperitoneal injections of PBS, 6 U/g L-asp, 50 mg/kg CQ or both L-asp
and CQ. Asn levels in the plasma of mice treated with L-asp were
completely depleted (Figure 4b). A decrease in leukemia burden
and increase in outcome improvement were observed in mice

administered L-asp and CQ combined treatment, compared with
mice treated with L-asp or CQ alone (Figures 4c and d and
Supplementary Figure S4A). This therapeutic effect by combined
treatment with L-asp and CQ was also observed in other xenograft
models using 697-Luc2 cells (Supplementary Figures S4B and C).
As hepatomegaly is caused by inﬁltration of leukemia cells, the
liver weight of mice with leukemia is used as the indicator of
objective response to antileukemic agents on some occasions.23,24
Mice treated with L-asp or CQ alone were found to have
signiﬁcantly decreased body weight and increased liver weight
compared with mice administered L-asp and CQ combined
treatment (Figures 4e and f), which indicate a remarkable
antileukemic response. In addition, we could not ﬁnd any signs
of the treatment-related complication including hemorrhage or
infarction in the killed mice. Importantly, LC3B-positive puncta
were observed to be accumulated in ALL cells that remained
within the bone marrow, peripheral blood and central nervous

system of the mice receiving combined treatment, indicating the
therapeutically sufﬁcient autophagy inhibition (Supplementary
Figure S5). These ﬁndings strongly suggested that combined
treatment with L-asp and CQ may be therapeutically useful
for ALL.
The ROS-p53-positive feedback loop is an essential mechanism of
the combined treatment of L-asp and CQ
We attempt to determine the molecular mechanism underlying
the synergistic effect of L-asp-induced cytotoxicity and autophagy
inhibition. Although the apoptosis pathway via the ATF4-CHOP
axis is known to be involved in L-asp-induced cytotoxicity,25 this
pathway was not signiﬁcantly activated in cells treated with the
combination of L-asp and CQ, compared with the cells treated
with L-asp alone (Supplementary Figure S6), suggesting that other
mechanisms may contribute to the induction of cell death by

combined treatment with L-asp and CQ. We then focused on
the production of ROS as a possible mechanism because ROS
levels were remarkably increased during combined treatment
(Figure 2e). ROS scavenger N-acetyl-L-cysteine rescued the
induction of cell death by combined treatment with L-asp and
CQ (Figure 5a and Supplementary Figure S7A), indicating that
excessive ROS accumulation is critical for the induction of
cytotoxicity by the combined treatment. Severe ROS accumulation
leads to irreparable DNA damage, which may induce the
ROS–DNA damage-p53-positive feedback loop.26 The protein
expression levels of p53 and PUMA were remarkably increased,
and was accompanied by DNA damage indicated by an increased
level of γH2AX, in cells treated with the combination of L-asp and
CQ compared with cells treated with L-asp alone in both REH and
697 cells with TP53 wild type (Figure 5b and Supplementary
Figure S7B). The inhibition of ROS production by treatment with
N-acetyl-L-cysteine led to the reduction of both DNA damage and
p53 expression (Figure 5c and Supplementary Figure S7C). TP53
knockdown resulted in the reduction of ROS and DNA damage in
Oncogene (2017) 4267 – 4276

cells treated with the combination of L-asp and CQ (Figures 5d
and e and Supplementary Figures S7D and E). TP53 is known to
have multiple roles in the regulation of autophagy.27 In western
blot analysis, knockdown of TP53 did not exert a sever inﬂuence
on L-asp-induced autophagy (Supplementary Figures S7F). Importantly, when TP53 expression was inhibited by differentiating two
knockdown systems using short hairpin RNA (shRNA) or siRNA, the
synergistic cytotoxic effect of L-asp and CQ combined treatment
was abrogated (Figure 5f and Supplementary Figures S7G and H).
Activated p53 transcriptionally upregulated the pro-oxidant
genes, including PUMA, TP53I3, SCO2, and downregulated the
anti-oxidant gene HK2 (Supplementary Figure S7I). In addition, in
overall survival analysis of mice transplanted with TP53-knockdown or control ALL cells treated with L-asp and CQ combination,
poor outcome was observed in mice transplanted with TP53knockdown ALL cells (sh-p53), similar to those receiving no
treatment (Figure 5g). We ﬁnally examined the functional role of
p53 on the synergistic effect of L-asp and CQ combination
treatment in seven primary ALL samples, including six cases with

wild-type TP53 and one case with mutant TP53 (R248Q). These
samples were derived from ﬁve newly diagnosed patients and two
relapsed patients. Clinical features of these patients are shown in
Supplementary Table S3. As expected, the synergistic effect of
L-asp and CQ was observed in ALL cells derived from the six wildtype TP53 samples, but not in ALL cells from the mutant TP53
sample (Figure 5h). In addition, adenovirus-mediated expression
of exogenous TP53 into TP53-mutated ALL cells from No.7 patient
or TP53-mutated ALL cell lines, Jurkat and CCRF-CEM, induced the
synergistic effect by combined treatment with L-asp and CQ
(Figure 5i and Supplementary Figure S7J). These ﬁndings strongly
suggest that p53 function is essential for this synergistic effect.
DISCUSSION
In the present study, we clariﬁed the physiological effect of L-asp
and the biological signiﬁcance of L-asp-induced autophagy, and
additionally demonstrated the therapeutic effectiveness of
autophagy inhibition by CQ in combination with L-asp treatment
in ALL cells. The treatment with L-asp results in metabolic
shutdown via the reduction of both glycolysis and oxidative
phosphorylation, accompanied by mitochondrial injury and ROS
production. Importantly, we demonstrated that the inhibition of
autophagy using CQ enhances L-asp-induced cytotoxicity and
overcomes the acquired resistance to L-asp in ALL cells via ROSp53-positive feedback loop as an essential mechanism of this
synergistic cytotoxicity Figure 6.
Several studies have suggested that autophagy may act as a
cytoprotective mechanism in tumor cells and that therapyinduced cell death can be enhanced upon autophagy
inhibition.18,28–30 It has been reported that cytoprotective
autophagy was induced by treatment with L-asp and autophagy
inhibition enhanced L-asp-induced cytotoxicity in K562 cells, a
chronic myeloblastic leukemia cell line. However, the functional
role of L-asp-induced autophagy has not been clariﬁed. While it
has been believed that L-asp-induced autophagy contributes to
the supply of amino acids including Asn and Gln,16–18,31 our data
in the current study suggest that L-asp-induced autophagy
predominantly have a function as elimination of damaged
mitochondrial rather than supply of intracellular amino acids by
recycling. In treatment of patients with ALL, L-asp is used in
combination with vincristine and prednisone.2 Prednisone is
reported to induce autophagy, which is required for cell
death.32–34 Thus, the modulation of autophagy by CQ needs to
consider autophagic effect on combined drugs other than L-asp in
the clinical setting of ALL.
We demonstrated in an ALL xenograft model that autophagy
inhibition using CQ with L-asp treatment is therapeutically
effective. Notably, the effect of L-asp and CQ combined treatment
could be observed in ALL cells that remained within the bone

marrow and central nervous system, suggesting the potency of
autophagy inhibition with CQ in combination with L-asp treatment in intractable ALLs. In addition to clinical trials utilizing the
inhibition of autophagy by CQ for treatment of solid tumors in
adults, CQ is clinically used as an FDA-approved drug for
treatment of pediatric patients with several diseases, such as
malaria and interstitial lung disease.35,36 However, CQ may cause
severe side effects, including irreversible retinal toxicity.36 Moreover, CQ is not a speciﬁc autophagy inhibitor, but also modulates
various additional signal transduction pathways.37 Therefore,
development of therapeutic agents that can speciﬁcally inhibit
the autophagy pathway is required for the clinical use.
We showed that functional p53 is needed for the synergistically
cytotoxic effect of L-asp and CQ combined treatment in ALL cells.
While autophagy was shown to be required for the development
of Ras-driven pancreatic tumors in a previous study, autophagy
inhibition by CQ promoted tumorigenesis in developing tumors
lacking p53.38 Another study reported that p53 has an important
role in the combined effect of temozolomide and CQ in
glioblastoma.39 Thus, these previous reports together with the
present results suggest that functional p53 has an essential role in
autophagy inhibition-mediated cytotoxicity. Because mutations of
the TP53 gene are observed in ~ 6–8% of pediatric ALL patients,40
the majority of pediatric patients may beneﬁt from the combined
effect of autophagy inhibition and L-asp treatment.
In summary, we reported molecular evidence supporting the
development of a novel therapeutic strategy of combined L-asp
and autophagy inhibition for ALL. It will be important for ALL
patients to evaluate the autophagy ﬂux before, after or during
L-asp treatment. Further validation of this strategy, together with
determination of p53 status, in a large cohort of patients is
warranted to effectively evaluate its impact on the treatment
of ALL.

relapsed ALL). Cells were isolated by Ficoll density-gradient separation.
Written informed consent was obtained from all of the patients. The
collection and analysis of patient samples were approved by the ethics
committees of the Tokyo Medical and Dental University Institutional
Review Board (approval #2010-5-2) and Hamamatsu University School of
Medicine (approval #24-284).

Cell viability assay and apoptosis assay
ALL cells were plated at 1 × 106 cells in six-well plates and treated with the
appropriate reagents. Viable and dead cells were counted using trypan
blue assay by the TC20 Automated Cell Counter (BioRad Laboratories,
Richmond, CA, USA). Apoptosis was assessed by ﬂow cytometry using
Annexin-V/propidium iodide staining (MEBCYTO-Apoptosis Kit, MBL Co.,
Ltd., Nagoya, Japan). All experiments were performed in triplicate.

Animals
Female non-obese diabetic/severe combined immunodeﬁcient mice were
purchased from Charles River Laboratories Japan. ALL cells (5 × 106 per
100 μl) infected with a lentiviral vector for Luc2 were injected into the tail
vein of non-obese diabetic/severe combined immunodeﬁcient mice (age
6–8 weeks). Concentration of L-asp dose in in vivo experiment was decided
using the interview form of LEUNASE as reference. The intraperitoneal
lethal dose 50 of LEUNASE in mice was estimated to be 10 U/g; therefore,
we performed preliminary experiments and ascertained that our mice
had a tolerance to repeated intraperitoneal injection of 6 U/g L-asp and
50 mg/kg CQ administration once every day for more than 50 days.
Leukemia burden was measured by luciferase activity using a luminometer
(Photon Imager, Biospace Lab, Nesles la Vallée, France) after 150 mg/kg
D-luciferin (Synchem UG & Co. KG, Felsberg, Germany) injection. All
experimental protocols conducted on the mice were approved by the
Tokyo Medical and Dental University Animal Care and Use Committee.

Measurement of intracellular and plasma amino-acid levels
Cells were washed three times with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline
(PBS) and homogenized in 80% methanol containing phenyl-d5-alanine as
an internal standard for extraction, and then centrifuged (15 000 r.p.m. for
15 min at 4 °C) to obtain supernatants. Samples were evaporated and then
resuspended in a small volume of water before derivatization. For aminoacid analysis in plasma, mouse blood samples were collected by
cardiocentesis, mixed with ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid and immediately cooled on ice. Plasma was separated by centrifugation at 800 g for
15 min at 4 °C, and was deproteinized in a ﬁnal concentration of 50%
acetonitrile. The supernatant was used for the following analysis.
Amino-acid analysis using high-performance liquid chromatography and
electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry was carried out as
described previously41 with minor modiﬁcations. Samples were mixed with
APDSTAG Wako Amino Acids Internal Standard Mixture Solution and
derivatized with 3-aminopyridyl-N-hydroxysuccinimidyl carbamate. Derivatized samples were injected onto an Agilent 1200 series liquid
chromatography system (Agilent Technologies, Waldbrunn, Germany)
coupled to an API 4000 triple quadrupole mass spectrometer (Applied
Biosystems-MDS Sciex, Concord, ON, Canada). An Inertsil C8-3 column (GL
Sciences Inc., Tokyo, Japan) and the mobile phase A (APDSTAGTM Wako
Eluent) and B (water and acetonitrile) were used for separation.

Measurement of OCR and ECAR
OCR and ECAR were measured using the Seahorse XF24 Flux Analyzer
(Seahorse Bioscience, North Billerica, MA, USA). A total of 3 × 105 cells per
well were seeded on a gelatin-coated plate in regular medium. The
medium was replaced with XF Assay Medium (Seahorse Bioscience)
supplemented with 1 mM pyruvate, 10 mM glucose and 2 mM Gln (pH 7.4)
1 h before measurement. Oligomycin, carbonyl cyanide 4-(triﬂuoromethoxy)phenylhydrazone and antimycin/rotenone were added by the
Flux Analyzer when indicated.

Detection of mitochondrial membrane potential and cellular ROS
Mitochondrial membrane potential and intracellular ROS production were
measured using TMRE (tetramethylrhodamine, ethyl ester) Mitochondrial
Membrane Potential Assay Kit (ab113852) and DCFDA Cellular ROS
Detection Assay Kit (ab113851), respectively (both from Abcam, Cambridge, UK). For the TMRE assay, cells were incubated with 100 nM of TMRE
for 15 min at 37 °C with 5% CO2 and then suspended in PBS with 0.2% FBS.
For the ROS detection assay, cells were harvested and incubated with
10 μM of DCFDA (intracellular ROS) for 30 min and MitoSOX (mitochondrial
ROS, Thermo Scientiﬁc, Waltham, MA, USA) at 37 °C with 5% CO2.
Fluorescence intensity for both procedures was measured by ﬂow
cytometry and a microplate reader.
Oncogene (2017) 4267 – 4276

Cell cycle analysis
Cells were washed in PBS and ﬁxed in 70% cold ethanol overnight
at − 20 °C. Fixed cells were washed in PBS, incubated in PBS containing
RNase (250 μg/ml) for 30 min at 37 °C and then stained with propidium
iodide (Thermo Scientiﬁc). Fluorescence intensities were measured by ﬂow
cytometry and cell population analysis was performed using the FlowJo
software (Tree-star Inc., Ashland, OR, USA).

Generation of L-asp-resistant cells
L-asp-resistant cells were established by sequential incubation of parental
cells with increasing concentrations of L-asp from 0.01 to 1.0 U/ml for
6 months in resistant cells from 697 cells (697-R).

Measurement of mitochondrial DNA copy number and
mitochondrial mass
The relative ratio of mitochondrial DNA to nuclear genomic DNA was
measured using the Human Mitochondrial DNA Monitoring Primer Set
Ratio kit (Takara Bio, Shiga, Japan). For measurement of mitochondrial
mass, cells were incubated with 100 nM of MitoTracker green (Thermo
Scientiﬁc) for 30 min, and ﬂuorescence intensities were measured by ﬂow
cytometry.

Immunoﬂuorescence analysis
Cells were ﬁxed in cold methanol for 5 min. After blocking with PBS
containing 1% bovine serum albumin and 0.01% Triton X-100 for 1 h
at 4 °C, the cells were incubated with anti-LC3B (Sigma-Aldrich Co.) and/or
human CD45-FITC antibodies (Becton, Dickinson and Company, Franklin
Lakes, NJ, USA) overnight at 4 °C. Bound antibodies were visualized using
Alexa Fluor 488 anti-mouse IgG antibody (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA).
The cells were mounted in VECTASHIELD Mounting Medium with DAPI
(Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA, USA). Images were obtained by
confocal ﬂuorescence microscopy (Nikon, Tokyo, Japan).

Electron microscopy
The cells were ﬁxed with 2.5% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 M PBS overnight. They
were washed with 0.1 M PBS and post-ﬁxed with 1% OSO4 buffered in 0.1 M
PBS for 2 h. Then, the cells were dehydrated in a graded series of ethanol
solutions and embedded in Epon 812. Ultrathin (90 nm) sections were
collected on copper grids, double-stained with uranyl acetate and lead
citrate and examined by transmission electron microscopy (H-7100,
Hitachi, Tokyo, Japan).

Gene expression array analysis
Gene expression proﬁling of ALL cells was performed as previously
reported.42 GO analysis was performed using DAVID (https://david.ncifcrf.
gov/home.jsp) and gene set enrichment analysis (http://www.broadinsti
tute.org/gsea/index.jsp). The microarray data from this publication have
been submitted to the GEO database (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/)
and assigned the identiﬁer GSE94289.

Real-time polymerase chain reaction
Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was carried out
using TaqMan polymerase with SYBR Green ﬂuorescence (KAPA SYBR FAST
qPCR Master Mix: NIPPON Genetics, Tokyo, Japan) on an ABI PRISM 7300
Sequence Detector (Applied Biosystems, Concord, ON, Canada). Real-time
RT-qPCR analysis was performed using speciﬁc primers (Supplementary
Table S1).

Western blotting
Western blotting analysis was performed as previously reported.42
Antibodies for LC3B (L7543), β-actin (A5441) and asparagine synthetase
(A6485) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich; ATF4 (L0911) was from Santa
Cruz Biotechnology (Dallas, TX, USA); p53 (OP43L) was from Calbiochem
(San Diego, CA, USA); cleaved PARP (#9541), cleaved CASP3 (#9661), CASP3
(#9662), CHOP (#2895), BECN1 (#4122) and ATG5 (#12994) were from Cell
Signaling (Danvers, MA, USA); γH2AX (ab11174) was from Abcam.

Transduction of shRNA or siRNA
shRNA oligonucleotides for TP53 (target sequence: 5′-GACTCCAGTG
GTAATCTAC-3′) were annealed and inserted into the pGreenPuro vector
(System Biosciences, Palo Alto, CA, USA). Lentivirus was prepared using
HEK293T cells and the pPACK Packaging Kit (System Biosciences)
according to the manufacturer's instructions. Virus titer was measured in
IFU/ml by a RT–PCR-based method using the Global UltraRapid Lentiviral
Titer Kit (System Biosciences). Cells were infected with 5 multiplicity of
infection (PFU/cell) of lentivirus with either an empty vector (as a control)
or p53-shRNA vector using TransDux (System Biosciences).
The siRNA for TP53 (M-003329-03-0005), BECN1 (M-010552-01-0005),
ATG5 (M-004374-04-0005), ATG7 (M-020112-01-0005) and non-targeting
negative control (D-001206-14-05) were obtained from Thermo Scientiﬁc
Dharmacon. Cells were transfected with 10 nM of each siRNA using the HVJ
Envelope Vector Kit (GENOMEONE-Neo, Ishihara Sangyo), according to the
manufacturer's instructions.

Recombinant Adenovirus infection
The TP53 adenovirus was prepared and cells were infected as previously
described.43 As a control, an Ad-LacZ adenovirus encoding the
β-galactosidase gene was constructed from the cosmid pAxCAiLacZ
(Takara Bio).

Mutation analysis in TP53 by direct sequencing
Mutations within coding exons in the TP53 gene were analyzed by direct
DNA sequencing. DNA fragments were ampliﬁed by PCR using primer pairs
described previously (http://www-p53.iarc.fr) and then PCR products were
sequenced by primer for each exon.

Statistics
The experiments performed in ALL cell lines were performed independently in triplicate. All P-values were two-tailed and considered signiﬁcant
at o0.05. Statistical analyses were performed using the statistical software
EZR (Saitama Medical Center, Jichi Medical University, Saitama, Japan).44
We analyzed drug synergism using the Chou-Talalay median-effect
method45 and used CalcuSyn software (Biosoft, Cambridge, UK) to
calculate the combination index and perform isobologram analysis of
drug interactions.
