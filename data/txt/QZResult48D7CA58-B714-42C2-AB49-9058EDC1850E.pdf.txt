Abstract

Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts

We previously identified CLEC14A as a tumour endothelial marker. Here we show CLEC14A is a
regulator of sprouting angiogenesis in vitro and in vivo. Using a HUVEC spheroid sprouting assay
we found CLEC14A to be a regulator of sprout initiation. Analysis of endothelial sprouting in
aortic ring and in vivo subcutaneous sponge assays from clec14a+/+ and clec14a−/− mice revealed
defects in sprouting angiogenesis in CLEC14A deficient animals. Tumour growth was retarded
and vascularity reduced in clec14a−/− mice. Pulldown and co-immunoprecipitation experiments
confirmed MMRN2 binds to the extracellular region of CLEC14A. The CLEC14A-MMRN2
interaction was interrogated using mouse monoclonal antibodies. Monoclonal antibodies were
screened for their ability to block this interaction. Clone C4 but not C2 blocked CLEC14AMMRN2 binding. C4 antibody perturbed tube formation and endothelial sprouting in vitro and in
vivo, with a similar phenotype to loss of CLEC14A. Significantly, tumour growth was impaired in
C4 treated animals and vascular density was also reduced in the C4 treated group. We conclude
that CLEC14A-MMRN2 binding has a role in inducing sprouting angiogenesis during tumour
growth, that has the potential to be manipulated in future anti-angiogenic therapy design.

Introduction

Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts

It is well established that solid tumour growth relies on the recruitment of endothelial cells
and ultimately blood vessels from the surrounding healthy tissue. These recruited blood
vessels deliver oxygen and nutrients, through blood flow, to the tumour. A primary
mechanism of this recruitment is through sprouting angiogenesis of vessels adjacent to the
tumour arising from tumour-derived release of VEGF. Sprouting angiogenesis is a tightly
regulated process, where the main regulatory components are VEGFR2, Notch and
Angpoietin/Tie2 signalling pathways with cross-talk been these systems essential for
direction, growth and cell specification.1,2 However, recent studies have highlighted the role
of multiple other pathways as regulators of this process, including factors involved in
glycolysis,3 PKA signalling,4 as well as new regulators of extracellular matrix
composition.5,6 Manipulation of these factors has also been shown to suppress angiogenic
sprouting in vitro and in vivo.
Targeting angiogenesis in cancer has many therapeutic advantages, including efficient
delivery to target tissue type, stable genetic profile, and lower potential for side effects than
conventional chemotherapy. Current anti-angiogenic therapies in the clinic primarily target
the VEGF signalling pathway, but with limited success.7 More recent efforts to develop
effective anti-angiogenic therapies have focussed on understanding and targeting the
endothelial tip and stalk cells during sprouting angiogenesis.2 For this to be effective, greater
knowledge is required to understand the pathways involved in tip cell formation and
behaviour.

CLEC14A is a single-pass transmembrane glycoprotein that belongs to the vascular
expressed C-type lectin family 14, whose other members include CD248/TEM1/Endosialin,
Thrombomodulin and CD93.8 Although functionally CLEC14A is relatively unstudied,
available data suggests that manipulation of CLEC14A levels or function blocking
antibodies will regulate endothelial migration possibly through an interaction with the
extracellular matrix.9-12 CLEC14A was originally identified to be an endothelial specific
gene that is highly upregulated on vessels associated with multiple solid tumours.9 More
recent work has shown CLEC14A as part of a “common angiogenesis signature” in a metaanalysis of 121 head and neck squamous cell carcinomas, 959 breast cancers and 170 clear
cell renal cell carcinomas.13 MMRN2, an endothelial specific member of the emilin family
and component of the extracellular matrix,14,15 was recently found as an extracellular
interacting protein for CLEC14A and MMRN2 and CLEC14A were both upregulated in
tumour vasculature during tumour progression.11 Thus, although it is becoming apparent
that CLEC14A has a likely function in the tumour vasculature our knowledge is restricted.
In this study we have investigated CLEC14A in sprouting angiogenesis and for the first time
examined its role in vivo.

CLEC14A regulates sprouting angiogenesis in vitro

vitro.9 To investigate the role of CLEC14A in sprouting angiogenesis in vitro, HUVEC

spheroids were generated from HUVECs treated with siRNAs targeting clec14a or a noncomplementary siRNA duplex. Knockdown of clec14a expression was confirmed at the
mRNA level by qPCR for both clec14a targeted siRNAs with an average reduction of 84%
and 83% across three experiments (Figure 1A) and at the protein level by Western blot
analysis of protein extracts probed with an anti-CLEC14A polyclonal antisera (Figure 1B).
VEGF induced sprouting from CLEC14A knockdown spheroids was impaired, knockdown
spheroids produced on average 6.9 or 6.4 sprouts per spheroid for duplex 1 or 2 respectively,
compared to 13.2 for control cells (Figures 1C and 1D). To determine the role of CLEC14A
in tip/stalk cell formation, control HUVECs and knockdown HUVECs were stained either
red or green and mixed, prior to spheroid formation and induced sprouting (Figure 1E).
Knockdown of CLEC14A reduced the percentage of cells at the tip position (33%)
compared to control cells (67%), however, there was no effect on the percentage of stalk
cells that were derived from CLEC14A knockdown HUVECs (Figure 1F). These data
suggest CLEC14A has a role in sprout initiation and migration.
CLEC14A regulates sprouting angiogenesis in vivo
Previously published data for CLEC14A has demonstrated its role in endothelial biology in
vitro, however its in vivo role has not been reported. To investigate the role of CLEC14A in
vivo and ex vivo, mice were generated to replace the clec14a coding sequence with a lacZ
reporter (Figure 2A). Breeding was normal (Supplemental Table 1). Aortas were isolated
from clec14a+/+ and clec14a−/− mice. Extracted cDNA was analysed by qPCR and
confirmed loss of the clec14a coding region but expression of the 5′ and 3′ untranslated
regions were retained (Figure 2B) and expression of mmrn2 was unaltered (Supplemental
Figure 1). Loss of CLEC14A at the protein level was also confirmed by Western blot
analysis of lung tissue lysates (Figure 2C).

Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts

To confirm the role of CLEC14A in sprouting angiogenesis in a multicellular three
dimensional co-culture, aortas were isolated, cut into rings and embedded in collagen.
Cellular outgrowth was stimulated by VEGF and monitored over 7 days before end-point
quantitation of endothelial sprouting. Again, loss of CLEC14A impaired endothelial sprout
outgrowth and migration (Figure 2D). Aortic rings from wildtype mice produced over
double the number of tubes compared to that observed for CLEC14A knockout mice (30.6
tubes compared to 13.4 tubes respectively) (Figure 2E). In addition, the maximum
migration, which is defined by the furthest distance migrated away from each aortic ring,
was also reduced in knockout cultures (Figure 2F). To assess whether CLEC14A has a
similar function in vivo, sponge barrels were implanted subcutaneously into CLEC14A
knockout mice. Cellular infiltration and neo-angiogenesis were stimulated using bFGF
injections into the sponge every two days for two weeks. Macroscopic analysis of sponge
sections stained with haematoxylin and eosin revealed impaired infiltration of cells into the
sponge in clec14a−/− animals (Figures 2G and 2H). In addition, vascularity was significantly
reduced (p<0.01) for clec14a−/− animals (Figure 2I). To confirm the endothelial cells lining
the neoangiogenic vessels express clec14a in this model, sponges and livers from CLEC14A
KO mice were stained with x-gal. Strong x-gal staining was observed on blood vessels
within the sponge compared to matched liver sections (Figure 2J). From these data we can
conclude that mouse CLEC14A expression regulates endothelial migration and angiogenic

CLEC14A promotes tumour growth

Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts

CLEC14A expression is found highly up-regulated on human tumour vessels compared to
vessels from healthy tissue, suggesting that cancer therapies could be targeted against
CLEC14A.9 Therefore, to investigate whether loss of CLEC14A effects tumour growth, we
used the syngeneic Lewis lung carcinoma (LLC) model. For this 1×106 LLC cells were
injected subcutaneously into the right flank of either clec14a+/+ or clec14a−/− mice. Tumour
growth was impaired in the clec14a−/− mice compared to clec14a+/+ littermates (Figure 3A).
This was confirmed by three independent experiments. Excised tumours taken from
clec14a−/− mice were smaller in size (Figure 3B) and smaller in weight (Figure 3C) than
clec14a+/+ littermates. To determine whether the vascular density within these tumours was
also effected, tissue sections were stained with an anti-CD31 antibody. Analysis shows a
reduced density of discrete vessels (Figures 3D and 3E) and reduced percentage endothelial
coverage (Figure 3F). In healthy tissues, highest expression of x-gal in sections from
clec14a−/− mice was seen in the liver vessels (black arrow) but was vastly less than that seen
on both mature vessels, with erythrocyte filled lumens (Figure 3G, black arrows), and
immature microvessels within the tumour (Figure 3G, red arrows), confirming clec14a is
upregulated on tumour vessels.
Identification and confirmation of CLEC14A-MMRN2 interaction

Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts

To identify potential binding partners for the extracellular domain for CLEC14A, we first
purified CLEC14A extracellular domain protein tagged with human Fc. This protein or Fc
alone was incubated with HUVEC whole cell lysates and precipitated using protein A
agarose beads. The precipitated proteins were then washed and separated on a SDS-PAG.
Seven gel regions were excised, digested and analysed by mass spectrometry. The most
abundant protein identified was MMRN2 with 12 peptides (11 unique), and no peptides in
the corresponding control pulldown fraction. Western blot analysis of the precipitates
confirmed the presence of MMRN2 in the CLEC14A-ECD-Fc pull-down and was not
detected in the Fc alone pull-down (Figure 4A). To further confirm this interaction,
endogenous CLEC14A was immunoprecipitated from HUVEC whole cell lysates. Western
blot analysis confirmed MMRN2 co-precipitation in the CLEC14A precipitate but was not
detected in the IgG control (Figure 4B).
Development and validation of CLEC14A monoclonal antibodies
To further our understanding of CLEC14A, we next produced cross-species reactive
antibodies. To enable this, murine CLEC14A protein with a human Fc tag was expressed in
HEK293T cells and purified on a protein A column. Mice were then immunised with 50 μg
mCLEC14A with complete Freund’s adjuvant to break tolerance. Clones were screened for
activity against human CLEC14A or human Fc. To confirm the clones could recognise cell
bound CLEC14A, HEK293T cells overexpressing HA-CLEC14A were stained with clone
C2 or C4 or a monoclonal HA tag antibody. FACs analysis shows increased fluorescence for
each of the antibodies in the HA-CLEC14A overexpressing cells compared to control
transfected cells (Figure 5A). To confirm that antibodies recognise the endogenous form of

CLEC14A, these clones were used to stain HUVEC treated with control or clec14a targeted
siRNAs. Control HUVEC were stained strongly by clone C2 and C4 and this staining was
reduced to isotype control levels by knockdown of CLEC14A (Figure 5B). These results
confirmed the specificity of the CLEC14A monoclonal antibodies.

Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts

To determine whether the C2 and C4 clones bind to the same region of CLEC14A, HUVECs
were pre-treated with BSA, C2 or C4 antibody prior to C2-FITC staining. C2 incubation
blocked C2-FITC staining effectively, but C4 had little effect (Figure 5C). The same pretreatment was repeated prior to C4-FITC staining. C2 antibody did not effect C4-FITC
staining however, HUVECs pre-treated with C4 showed reduced binding of C4-FITC
(Figure 5D). From these results we can conclude that C2 and C4 bind to discrete regions of
CLEC14A.
A CLEC14A monoclonal antibody blocks CLEC14A-MMRN2 binding
To determine whether either of these CLEC14A monoclonal antibodies could inhibit the
binding of MMRN2 to CLEC14A, CLEC14A-ECD-Fc was pre-incubated with increasing
concentrations of mIgG1, or C2, or C4, prior to incubation with lysates from HEK293T cells
overexpressing MMRN2. Precipitates were then separated and probed for MMRN2 or
CLEC14A-ECD-Fc. MMRN2 binding was observed for CLEC14A-ECD-Fc precipitates
blocked with mIgG1 or C2 (Figure 5E) but no MMRN2 binding was observed in the C4
blocked precipitates (Figure 5F). This confirms that the C4 but not the C2 monoclonal
antibody blocks MMRN2 binding to CLEC14A.
CLEC14A-MMRN2 blocking antibody inhibits tube formation and sprouting angiogenesis
in vitro and in vivo

Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts

We previously showed that CLEC14A expression regulates endothelial cell migration and
tube formation.9 To assess whether C2 or C4 have a role in modulating endothelial cell
migration, wounds were scratched into HUVEC monolayers and treated with 20 μg/ml
mIgG1, C2 or C4. Wound closure was assessed at 16-24 hours. However, no difference was
observed between any of the treatments (data not shown). Antibody treatment also had no
effect on CLEC14A expression (Supplemental Figure 2). To determine whether the
CLEC14A monoclonal antibodies have regulatory properties in in vitro tube formation,
HUVECs were plated onto Matrigel and treated with either mIgG1, C2 or C4 for 16hrs. The
C2 treatment had no effect on tube formation compared to the mIgG1 control; however, C4
treatment effected branching and meshes (Figure 6A). The number of meshes (Figure 6B)
was decreased in the C4 treatment group, with a corresponding increase in the number of
branches (Figure 6C) for this treatment group compared to the control and C2 groups.
Furthermore, C4 treated HUVECs have decreased branch length (Figure 6D). These data
suggest that C4 inhibits the sprouting or sensing and delays interconnectivity of the tubes,
but the second CLEC14A targeted antibody (C2) was without activity on tube formation.
To investigate how disruption of the MMRN2-CLEC14A interaction effects sprouting in
vitro, we treated HUVEC spheroids with 20 μg/ml C4 or C2 or mIgG1 control antibodies.
Control, mIgG1 treated, spheroids formed sprouts after 16 hours as expected (Figure 6E).
C2 treatment had no effect on sprouting, but C4 treatment inhibited sprout formation by

50 % (Figures 6E and 6F). To further investigate, aortic ring cultures were also
supplemented with 20 μg/ml C4 or C2 or mIgG1 antibodies. Endothelial outgrowth and tube
formation was well established after 7 days culture in the presence of mIgG1 (Figure 6G).
C4 antibody effectively inhibited tube outgrowth, however C2 antibody was inactive in
regulating tube/sprout formation from aortic rings (Figures 6G and 6H).

To confirm the importance of MMRN2, HUVECs were treated with mmrn2 targeted siRNA
or a control siRNA duplex. Knockdown of mmrn2 expression was confirmed by qPCR
(Figure 6I). Endothelial sprouting from MMRN2 knockdown HUVEC spheroids formed 8.9
(duplex 1) or 8.6 (duplex 2) sprouts per spheroid, compared to 15.7 for control spheroids
(Figure 6J).
To evaluate the role of the MMRN2-CLEC14A interaction in vivo, subcutaneous sponge
implants were used. Sponge infiltration was stimulated as previously described with the
addition of either 10 μg mIgG1 or C4 antibody. Total cellular sponge infiltration was
significantly reduced (p<0.01) in the C4 treatment group compared to the mIgG1 controls
(Figures 6K and 6L). Vascular density of the invaded sponge was also reduced for the C4
antibody group (Figure 6M). These data demonstrate that the MMRN2-CLEC14A
interaction promotes in vivo angiogenesis.
CLEC14A-MMRN2 blocking antibody inhibits tumour growth

Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts

As CLEC14A expression is most abundant on tumour endothelial cells and CLEC14A
expression is associated with MMRN2 in tumours,11 we hypothesised that disruption of this
interaction would perturb tumour growth. Therefore, mice with LLC tumours were injected
intraperitoneally twice per week with 10 μg C4 or mIgG1 (control) for the duration of the
experiment. Tumour growth was slowed for mice treated with C4 antibody compared to the
control, mIgG1, treatment group (Figure 7A). Tumours from the C4 treated mice were
smaller in size (Figure 7B) and weight (Figure 7C) than control animals. Again we
examined the vascular density within these tumours. Tissue sections were stained with an
anti-CD31 antibody and fluorescent analysis revealed a reduced density of discrete vessels
(Figures 7D and 7E) and the percentage endothelial coverage (Figure 7F). Suggesting that
CLEC14A binding to MMRN2 is an important functional component of tumour induced
angiogenesis.

Discussion
CLEC14A is one of a small group of endothelial genes that contribute to tumour
angiogenesis in multiple tumour types.9,13 Here we demonstrate that through loss of
CLEC14A, tumour growth is inhibited in vivo (Figure 3). A similar phenotype has also been
observed for other tumour endothelial markers, such as TEM8,16 Endoglin,17 Galectin,18
ELTD1,13 and Endosialin,19 this demonstrates the importance of these tumour endothelial
expressed genes in vascularisation and tumour growth. Although many groups have focused
on factors involved in physiological sprouting angiogenesis, these tumour endothelial
expressed genes could deliver tumour anti-angiogenic therapeutic potential.20

Upregulation of CLEC14A has been observed in human tumours9,13,21 and murine models
of pancreatic and cervical cancer11 which supports our findings that clec14a expression is
upregulated on tumour vessels in the LLC model (Figure 3). CLEC14A has been shown to
regulate multiple aspects of endothelial biology including adhesion,10,12 migration,9,10,12
tube formation,9-11 and we now demonstrate, as we first predicted,22 it is also important for
sprouting angiogenesis in vitro and in vivo (Figures 1 and 2). We can infer that this role of
CLEC14A is through endothelial-endothelial interactions or endothelial-extracellular matrix
interactions, because in vitro HUVEC sprouting is perturbed by CLEC14A knockdown,
suggesting the presence of other cell types is dispensable. We also observed for the first time
upregulation of clec14a expression on neoangiogenic vessels in the subcutaneous sponge
assay (Figure 2). This is expected as newly formed endothelial sprouts have been modelled
to experience extremely low shear stress (0.2 Pa) from the 4.2 μm of the bifurcation point to
the tip of the sprout,23 and clec14a expression is known to be upregulated by low shear
stress.9 Therefore, it is possible that CLEC14A has a role in regulating physiological
sprouting angiogenesis also, however, its role will likely be limited by the co-expression of
MMRN2.

Zanivan et al. identified MMRN2 as a component of the extracellular matrix that interacts
with CLEC14A.11 We independently verified this interaction through pulldown of proteins
from HUVEC lysates using the extracellular domain of CLEC14A, as well as coimmunoprecipitation of the endogenous proteins (Figure 4). Through the generation and
validation of CLEC14A monoclonal antibodies, we identified two antibodies that bind to
discrete regions of CLEC14A (Figure 5C and 5D) and have shown that the C4 but not the
C2 clone blocks the interaction of CLEC14A with MMRN2 (Figure 5E and 5F). To probe
the function of the CLEC14A-MMRN2 interaction, we used the C4 antibody in Matrigel
tube forming assays and found an increase in branching and decrease in evolved meshes
(Figure 6). Knockdown by siRNA or targeting with polyclonal CLEC14A antisera has a
similar effect on branching in this in vitro Matrigel assay.9 However, another monoclonal
antibody that binds CLEC14A but does not block MMRN2 binding had no effect (Figure 6).
In a study using phage display to develop IgGs targeting the c-type lectin domain (CTLD) of
CLEC14A, some of the generated IgGs reduced HUVEC cell migration and tube formation,
although not all of the clones tested.12 As our monoclonal antibody has a similar function it
is possible that the MMRN2 binding site is within the CTLD region of CLEC14A, although
further work is required to confirm this. In vitro and in vivo sprouting assays treated with C4
antibodies also demonstrated the role of the CLEC14A-MMRN2 interaction for endothelial
sprouting (Figure 6). Lorenzon et al previously observed anti-angiogenic activity with
soluble MMRN2 protein.33 This data supports our model, as soluble MMRN2 protein could
be binding to CLEC14A and disrupting the interaction of CLEC14A with MMRN2 in the
extracellular matrix (Figure 8). Finally, we found that the CLEC14A-MMRN2 interaction is
important for tumour growth (Figure 7), C4 treatment recapitulated tumour growth and
reduced tumour vascularity as seen in clec14a−/− mice (Figure 3). Antibody inhibition of
tumour endothelial marker function has been suggested as a mode of anti-angiogenic therapy
for TEM824 and our studies corroborate this approach. Although in this example no ligand
or mode of activity was identified. This is the first time that CLEC14A and a specific

extracellular interaction has been shown to be important for tumour growth, and suggests a

was performed 16 hours after embedding. To quantify sprout growth the number of sprouts
were counted, the cumulative sprout length and the maximal sprout length was assessed. For
two colour sprouting experiments, HUVECs were pre-labelled with orange and green
CellTracker dyes (Invitrogen). After 24 hours spheroids were fixed in 4% formaldehyde and
mounted with Vectorshield (Vector labs). Slides were imaged with an Axioskop2
microscope and AxioVision SE64 Rel4.8 software (Zeiss, Cambridge, UK).
For the Matrigel tube forming assays 1.4 × 105 HUVECs were seeded onto 70 μl basement
membrane extract (Matrigel, BD Bioscience) in a 12 well plate. After 16 hours, images were
taken of 5 fields of view per well using a Leica DM IL microscope (Leica, Milton Keynes,
UK) with a USB 2.0 2M Xli digital camera (XL Imaging LLC, Carrollton, TX, USA) at 10×
magnification. Images were analysed with the Angiogenesis analyser plugin for Image J
(Carpentier G. et al., Angiogenesis Analyzer for ImageJ. 4th ImageJ User and Developer
Conference proceedings) and available at the NIH website (http://imagej.nih.gov/ij/macros/
toolsets/Angiogenesis%20Analyzer.txt).
Protein production

Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts

Culture media (CM) from CLEC14A-Fc expressing HEK293T cells was collected. CM was
flowed over a HiTrap protein A HP column (GE healthcare, Amersham, UK) and protein
eluted using a 0-100 % gradient of 100 mM sodium citrate (pH 3) before neutralising with 1
M Tris base. Fractions were run on a SDS-PAG and assessed for protein purity and
specificity by Coomassie staining and Western blotting. Fractions containing similar
concentrations of protein were combined and dialysed in PBS prior to functional assays.
Monoclonal antibody generation
Mouse monoclonal antibodies were commercially prepared by Serotec Ltd (Oxford, UK)
using the following protocol to break tolerance supplied by us. Purified mouse CLEC14AFc fusion protein was given at 50 μg in Freunds complete adjuvant subcutaneously. Two
weeks later mice were given another 50 μg subcutaneously but this time in Freunds adjuvant.
Mice were culled and spleens harvested for fusion two weeks later.
Generation of clec14a−/− mice
Mice were housed at the Birmingham Biomedical Services Unit (Birmingham, UK).
C57BL/6N VGB6 feeder-dependent embryonic stem cells containing the CLEC14A deletion
cassette (Clec14atm1(KOMP)Vlcg; project ID VG10554) were procured from the Knockout
Mouse Project (University of California, Davis, USA). The Transgenic Mouse Facility at the

Aortic ring and murine subcutaneous sponge angiogenesis assay

Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts

Aortas were isolated and processed for aortic ring assays in collagen as previously
described.30 Tube/sprout outgrowth, maximal endothelial migration and total endothelial
outgrowth was quantitated. The murine subcutaneous sponge angiogenesis assay was
performed as previously described,31 with slight modification. Male C57 black mice were
implanted with a subcutaneous sterile polyether sponge disc (10×5×5 mm) under the dorsal
skin of each flank at day 0. 100 μl bFGF (40 ng/ml; R&D systems) was injected through the
skin directly into the sponges every other day for 14 days. Sponges were excised on day 14,
fixed in 10 % formalin, and paraffin embedded. Sections were stained with haematoxylin
and eosin, sponge cross-sections were taken using a Leica MZ 16 microscope (Leica, Milton
Keynes, UK) with a USB 2.0 2M Xli digital camera at ×1 magnification for cellular invasion
analysis. Images captured by Leica DM E microscope (Leica, Milton Keynes, UK) at 40×
magnification were analysed for vessel density. Vessel counts were assessed in five fields per
section per sponge. All animal experimentation was carried out in accordance with Home
Office License number PPL 40/3339 held by RB.
Tumour implantation assays
106 Lewis lung carcinoma cells were injected subcutaneously into the flank of male mice at
8-10 weeks of age. Tumour growth was monitored by daily calliper measurements and after
two-four weeks growth, tumour mass was determined by weight, fixed in 4 % PFA, paraffin
embedded and serial sections cut at 6 μm.
