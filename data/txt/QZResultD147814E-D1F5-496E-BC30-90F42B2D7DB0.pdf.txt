C-RAF Mutations Confer Resistance to RAF Inhibitors
Rajee Antony1,2, Caroline M. Emery1,2, Allison M. Sawyer1,2, and Levi A. Garraway1,2,3,4

Abstract
Melanomas that contain B-RAFV600E mutations respond transiently to RAF and MEK inhibitors; however,
resistance to these agents remains a formidable challenge. Although B- or C-RAF dysregulation represents
prominent resistance mechanisms, resistance-associated point mutations in RAF oncoproteins are surprisingly
rare. To gain insights herein, we conducted random mutagenesis screens to identify B- or C-RAF mutations
that confer resistance to RAF inhibitors. Whereas bona ﬁde B-RAFV600E resistance alleles were rarely observed,
we identiﬁed multiple C-RAF mutations that produced biochemical and pharmacologic resistance. Potent
C-RAF resistance alleles localized to a 14-3-3 consensus binding site or a separate site within the P loop. These
mutations elicited paradoxical upregulation of RAF kinase activity in a dimerization-dependent manner
following exposure to RAF inhibitors. Knowledge of resistance-associated C-RAF mutations may enhance
biochemical understanding of RAF-dependent signaling, anticipate clinical resistance to novel RAF inhibitors, and guide the design of "next-generation" inhibitors for deployment in RAF- or RAS-driven malignancies.

Introduction
Melanoma remains the deadliest form of skin cancer: its
annual incidence has reached 76,250 cases, and metastatic melanoma accounts for 9,180 deaths in the United States each year
(www.skincancer.org). The proliferation and survival of most
melanomas is driven by genetic activation of the mitogenactivated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway, a signaling cascade
whose core module consists of the RAS oncoprotein along with
RAF, MEK, and ERK kinases (1). Approximately 50% of cutaneous melanomas harbor gain-of-function mutations in the BRAF serine–threonine kinase—most commonly involving a
valine-to-glutamic acid substitution at codon 600 (BRAFV600E;
ref. 2). An additional 15% to 20% of melanomas contain oncogenic N-RAS mutations (3, 4). Efforts to target this pathway in
B-RAF–mutant melanoma have culminated in the emergence of
small-molecule RAF and MEK inhibitors into clinical practice
(5–8). Additional RAF inhibitors, including compounds with
enhanced potency, are sure to follow. In the future, these agents
will likely be used in combination with MEK inhibitors (9, 10).

Despite these advances, enthusiasm for this new class of
inhibitors has been tempered by the near-ubiquitous emergence of drug resistance after several months of treatment (6,
7, 11). Recent work has described 3 major categories of
resistance to RAF inhibition in B-RAFV600E melanoma. One
avenue involves engagement of parallel (or "bypass") signaling
modules, such as the kinase COT (12) or certain receptor
tyrosine kinase–driven pathways (12–15). A second mechanism consists of activating somatic mutations in the downstream effector kinase MEK1 (11, 16, 17). The third category
encompasses several distinct mechanisms that result in sustained RAF-dependent signaling, typically through ectopic CRAF activation (18). Clinically validated examples include
mutation of upstream C-RAF effectors (e.g., N-RAS; ref. 13)
and expression of an alternative splice isoform of B-RAF (p61B-RAF) that functions, in part, through enhanced dimerization
(19). In principle, however, any mechanism resulting in dysregulated C-RAF activation could cause resistance to the selective RAF inhibitors in current clinical use (12). B-RAF ampliﬁcation has also been reported in resistant specimens (20);
conceivably, this mechanism may operate either through an
excess of monomeric B-RAFV600E or by potentiating B-RAF/
C-RAF heterodimerization. All of the best supported resistance
mechanisms produce sustained MEK/ERK activation, thus
highlighting the continued importance of MAPK signaling in
melanoma survival and progression.
The ability of dysregulated C-RAF to transduce a key resistance mechanism in BRAFV600E melanoma accords well with
recent observations that RAF inhibitors can paradoxically
activate MEK/ERK signaling in the setting of upstream RAS
activation (18, 21–25). Both RAS signaling and C-RAF activation are suppressed in B-RAFV600E melanoma cells under
steady-state conditions (12, 24), owing largely to a profound
negative feedback regulation induced by oncogenic MAPK
output in this setting. Presumably, pharmacologic interdiction

C-RAF Mutations Confer Resistance

of oncogenic B-RAF signaling may potentiate a cellular context
more permissive for RAS-dependent C-RAF activation, which
can occur by multiple mechanisms. C-RAF may become activated through either RAS-dependent recruitment to the plasma membrane (26) or RAS-independent mechanisms operant
within the cytosol, where it undergoes conformational changes
and binds to scaffold proteins such as 14-3-3 (27–29). 14-3-3
binding (especially the zeta isoform; ref. 28) and subsequent
stabilization/activation of C-RAF is enabled by phosphorylation of activating residues such as serine 338 and tyrosine 341,
situated in its negatively charged N-terminal regulatory region;
or serine 621, located in the C-terminal region outside the
kinase domain; and numerous other phosphorylation sites
(22, 28–30). Moreover, homo- or heterodimerization appears
crucial for C-RAF activation (12, 18, 21–25, 29).
Given the elaborate regulatory mechanisms that govern
RAF-dependent signaling, it seems surprising that neither Bnor C-RAF point mutations have yet been observed in BRAFV600E melanomas that develop resistance to RAF inhibition.
The paucity of RAF resistance mutations is particularly noteworthy given the overall prevalence of secondary point mutations in kinase oncoproteins in the setting of resistance to
targeted agents (31). To gain additional insights into aspects of
RAF regulation that might prove relevant for oncogenic signaling and the emergence of therapeutic resistance, we conducted random mutagenesis screens and biochemical studies
to identify somatic B- or C-RAF variants capable of mediating
resistance to RAF inhibitors.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture
Cell lines were obtained from the American Tissue Culture
Collection or Allele Biotech and were cultured and maintained
at 37 C in Dulbecco's Modiﬁed Eagle Medium supplemented
with 10% FBS in a humidiﬁed atmosphere containing 5% CO2.
Cells were passaged for less than 6 months after receipt and
authenticated by short tandem repeat proﬁling.
B-RAF and C-RAF random mutagenesis screen
B-RAF and C-RAF cDNA were cloned into pWZL-Blast
vector (gift from J. Boehm and W. C. Hahn) by recombinational
cloning (Invitrogen). Speciﬁc mutations were introduced into
B-RAF and C-RAF cDNA using QuickChange II Site Directed
Mutagenesis (Stratagene). Random mutagenesis was conducted following a previously reported protocol (16). The
mutagenized B-RAF and C-RAF plasmids were used to infect
A375 melanoma cells. Following selection with blasticidin, cells
were plated on 15 cm dishes and cultured in the presence of
RAF inhibitor, PLX4720 (1.5 mmol/L) and RAF-265 (2 mmol/L)
for 4 weeks until resistant clones emerged.
Sequencing of C-RAF and B-RAF DNA
PLX4720- and RAF-265–resistant cells emerging from the BRAF random mutagenesis screens and PLX4720-resistant cells
emerging from the C-RAF random mutagenesis screens were
pooled and genomic DNA was prepared (Qiagen DNeasy). BRAF and C-RAF cDNAs were ampliﬁed from genomic DNA
using primers speciﬁc to ﬂanking vector sequence at the 50 and

www.aacrjournals.org

30 end and sequenced with Illumina 3G instrumentation
according to manufacturer's instructions.
Analysis of massively parallel sequencing
Raw data from massively parallel sequencing lanes (Illumina;
2–3 million 36 base pair sequences per lane) were analyzed
using a "next-generation" sequencing analysis pipeline. Output
from data ﬁles representing the nucleotide sequence, per-base
quality measure, variants detected, and alignment to cDNA
reference sequence (as determined by alignment with the
ELAND algorithm) were integrated and processed for each run.
Coverage (i.e., the number of fragments including each base
of the cDNA reference) was determined for all bases, and
variant alleles were mapped from individual DNA fragments
onto the reference sequence. The frequency of variation for
each non-wild-type allele was determined, and an average
variant score (AVS) was calculated as the mean of all quality
scores for the position and variant allele in question. All coding
mutations were translated to determine the amino acid variation (if any) and data for high-frequency (>0.5%) and highquality (AVS >7) mutations were loaded into the CCGD results
database.
Retroviral infections
Phoenix cells (70% conﬂuent) were transfected with pWZLBlast-C-RAF or B-RAF(V600E)-mutant libraries or the speciﬁc
mutants using Fugene 6 (Roche). Supernatants containing virus
were passed through a 0.45 mm syringe. A375 cells were infected
for 16 hours with virus together with polybrene (4 mg/mL,
Sigma). The selective marker blasticidin (3 mg/mL, Sigma) was
introduced 48 hours postinfection.
Western blot analysis
Samples were extracted after washing twice with PBS and
lysed with 150 mmol/L NaCl, 50 mmol/L Tris pH 7.5, 1 mmol/L
EDTA, phenylmethylsulfonyl ﬂuoride (PMSF), sodium ﬂuoride,
sodium orthovanadate, and protease inhibitor cocktail in the
presence of 1% NP-40. The protein content was estimated with
protein assay reagent (Bio-Rad) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Equal amounts of whole-cell lysates were
loaded onto and separated by 8% to 16% SDS-PAGE readymade
gels. Proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene diﬂuoride
membranes in a Trans-Blot apparatus. Membranes were
blocked with 5% skim milk in TBS containing 0.1% Tween
20 for 1 hour at room temperature or overnight at 4 C.
Membranes were then incubated with monoclonal or polyclonal antibody raised against the protein of interest for 1 hour
at room temperature or overnight at 4 C according to manufacturer guidelines and followed by 3 washes with TBS
containing 0.1% Tween 20. The immunoreactivity of the primary antibodies total C-RAF, p-C-RAF(S338), p-ERK, total ERK,
p-MEK, total MEK, 14-3-3z, Flag (Cell Signaling), B-RAF (Santa
Cruz Biotechnology), V5 (Invitrogen), and actin (Sigma) was
visualized with a secondary anti-rabbit (BD Transduction
Laboratories) or anti-mouse (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) antibodies conjugated with horseradish peroxidase and subsequent development with ECL Plus (Amersham Biosciences)
and autoradiography on X-OMAR TAR ﬁlms.

Immunoprecipitation
For immunoprecipitation with C-RAF antibody (BD Biosciences), protein G-Sepharose slurry (Thermo Scientiﬁc) was
washed with 1 PBS and incubated with C-RAF antibody or
normal mouse IgG (control) for 1 hour at 4 C. After three
washes with lysis buffer, the beads were incubated with wholecell lysates (0.5 mg of total protein) for 2 hours and then washed
3 times with lysis buffer. The proteins were then eluted by
boiling in 1 SDS sample buffer. For immunoprecipitation of
His/V5 or Flag-tagged plasmids, identical protocol was followed using Ni2þ (Qiagen) or Flag (Sigma) beads.
C-RAF kinase assay
293/T cells (70% conﬂuent) were transfected with 6 mg pcDNA with Flag tag containing C-RAF-WT and C-RAF variant
alleles. Forty-eight hours posttransfection, cells were treated
with vemurafenib (Allele Biotech) for 1 hour. For C-RAF
kinase assay with A375 cells, A375 cells infected with WT and
mutant C-RAF alleles were cultured in the absence and presence of vemurafenib for 16 hours. Lysates were extracted by
general protocol and immunoprecipitation using ﬂag beads/
C-RAF antibody was conducted overnight at 4 C, and bound
beads were washed 3 times with lysis buffer, followed by kinase
buffer (1). The protein-bound Flag beads/bound C-RAF
beads where incubated with 20 mL ATP/magnesium mixture,
20 mL of dilution buffer, and 0.5 mg of inactive MEK1 (Millipore)
for 30 minutes at 30 C. The phosphorylated MEK product was
detected by immunoblotting using a p-MEK antibody (Cell
Signaling Technology).
Pharmacologic growth inhibition assays
Cultured cells were seeded into 96-well plates at a density of
3,000 cells per well for all melanoma short-term cultures
including A375. After 16 hours, serial dilutions of the compound were conducted in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and
transferred to cells to yield drug concentrations based on the
potency of the drug, ensuring that the ﬁnal volume of DMSO
did not exceed 1%. The B-RAF inhibitor PLX4720 was purchased from Symansis, vemurafenib (Active Biochem),
AZD6244 (Selleck Chemicals), and GSK1120212 (Active Biochem). Following addition of the drug, cell viability was measured using the Cell-Titer-96 aqueous nonradioactive proliferation assay (Promega) after 4 days. Viability was calculated
as a percentage of the control (untreated cells) after background subtraction. A minimum of 6 replicates was made for
each cell line and the entire experiment was repeated at least 3
times. The data from the pharmacologic growth inhibition
assays were modeled using a nonlinear regression curve ﬁt
with a sigmoidal dose–response. These curves were displayed
using GraphPad Prism 5 for Windows (GraphPad).

Results
Identiﬁcation of resistance-associated RAF mutations by
random mutagenesis
To identify somatic RAF mutations that confer resistance to
RAF inhibitors, saturating random mutagenesis screens were
conducted using the XL1-Red bacterial system and retroviral
vectors expressing either B-RAFV600E or C-RAF cDNAs (11, 16).

The resulting mutagenized cDNA libraries were expressed in
the A375 melanoma cell line, which harbors the B-RAFV600E
mutation and is highly sensitive to RAF inhibitors (16, 32–34).
These cells were cultured in the presence of inhibitory concentrations of PLX4720 (1.5 mmol/L; B-RAFV600E and C-RAF
libraries) or RAF265 (2 mmol/L; BRAFV600E library only). Drugresistant colonies emerged after 28 days of drug exposure;
however, the outgrowth of resistant colonies appeared qualitatively more robust following C-RAF mutagenesis compared
with B-RAFV600E mutagenesis screens (data not shown). Resistant colonies (1,000 total from PLX4720 and 600 total from
RAF265 screens) were independently pooled and characterized
by massive parallel sequencing as described previously (11, 16).
Characterization of putative resistance mutations in
B-RAFV600E
The spectrum of "secondary" B-RAFV600E mutations that
emerged following selection with RAF inhibitors is shown
in Fig. 1A (PLX4720) and Supplementary Fig. S1A (RAF265).
Mutations involving 3 residues (T521K, V528F, and P686Q)
were observed in both mutagenesis screens and investigated
further by mapping to the B-RAFV600E crystal structure (PDB
code: 3OG7, Fig. 1B; ref. 33). Additional alleles were independently identiﬁed in either the PLX4720 or RAF265 screen (Fig.
1A and Supplementary Fig. S1A). The threonine residue at
position 521 (T521) maps to a linker region within the B-RAF
catalytic domain (Supplementary Fig. S1B). The valine at
position 528 (V528) resides immediately adjacent to the gatekeeper residue (threonine 529), which exerts signiﬁcant interactions with several known RAF inhibitors (35). Although
mutations of the gatekeeper residue were not observed in the
mutagenesis screens, the V528F allele is predicted to perturb
both the gatekeeper residue and the isoleucine at position 527,
which may also generate important protein–drug interactions
in the RAF inhibitor–bound protein (33). Interestingly, proline
686 localizes to a pocket in the C-terminus of the catalytic
domain that is analogous to the myristic acid–binding site of
the Abl kinase (36); however, myristylation of B-RAFV600E has
not been described.
To determine the functional effects of the putative BRAFV600E resistance alleles, mutations corresponding to each
of the 3 amino acids were introduced into B-RAFV600E cDNA
and ectopically expressed in A375 cells. Surprisingly, neither
ectopic B-RAFV600E nor the putative B-RAFV600E resistance
mutants conferred pharmacologic resistance to PLX4720 when
overexpressed in A375 cells (Fig. 1C). Furthermore, ectopic
expression of B-RAFV600E either by itself or harboring the
candidate resistance mutations induced its own degradation
without increasing MEK phosphorylation (p-MEK) compared
with B-RAFV600E (Supplementary Fig. S1C). Wild-type B-RAF
(e.g., lacking the oncogenic V600E mutation) also had little
effect on p-MEK in this context (Supplementary Fig. S1C and
S1D). Indeed, the T521K and P686T variants within B-RAFV600E
resulted in modestly diminished p-MEK compared with "parental" B-RAFV600E (Supplementary Fig. S1C), and expression of
V528F within B-RAFV600E markedly suppressed p-MEK levels
(Supplementary Fig. S1C). Thus, forced expression of the
putative B-RAFV600E resistance alleles conferred either neutral

or deleterious effects on MEK activation. Moreover, despite the
emergence of these B-RAFV600E alleles from random mutagenesis screens using 2 independent RAF inhibitors, none conferred resistance to RAF inhibition when ectopically expressed
in drug-sensitive melanoma cells (Fig. 1C). These mutations
may conceivably provide a subtle advantage to melanoma cells
during outgrowth under experimental drug selection; however,
their biologic impact remains uncertain. Such ambiguities may
also help explain why "secondary" B-RAFV600E resistance mutations have not yet been observed clinically.
Identiﬁcation and characterization of C-RAF resistance
alleles
In striking contrast to the B-RAFV600E results, C-RAF random
mutagenesis screens produced robust PLX4720-resistant colonies in a relatively short time frame (3–4 weeks). The landscape of putative C-RAF resistance alleles included multiple
recurrent variants (Fig. 2A) that localized to known functional
motifs within the C-RAF kinase domain (Fig. 2B). Unlike the BRAFV600E variants described above, all C-RAF mutations examined (Fig. 2A, arrows) could be stably expressed in A375 cells
(Supplementary Fig. S2A), without evidence of protein degradation. Furthermore, 8 of the 10 most prominent C-RAF
mutations conferred biochemical resistance to the RAF inhibitor PLX4720 in A375 cells, as evidenced by p-MEK and p-ERK
levels (Supplementary Fig. S2C). Thus, biologically consequential C-RAF mutations were readily identiﬁed by random
mutagenesis.

they aggregated within distinct functional motifs in either the
N-terminal regulatory region or the C-terminal kinase domain
(Fig. 2B; E104K, S257P, and P261T mutations could not be
mapped, as the full-length C-RAF structure has not been solved
to date.) The S257P and P261T mutations resemble 2 gain-offunction germline variants (S257L and P261S/L) observed in
patients with Noonan syndrome, an autosomal dominant
congenital disorder characterized by aberrant RAS/MAPK
pathway activation (37). Both S257 and P261 occupy 1 of the
2 14-3-3 consensus binding sites present in C-RAF (located in
the CR2 domain, Fig. 2B). As noted earlier, 14-3-3 proteins are
known to bind RAF kinases and regulate their activity and
stability (28). Conceivably, then, these variants may alter 14-3-3
binding to C-RAF, thereby enhancing its activity (37, 38).
The G356E and G361A variants mapped to the glycine-rich
GxGxxG motif found in the ATP-binding P-loop. Somatic Ploop mutations have been found in several protein kinases (2)
including BRAF (21, 22). The remaining mutations (S427T,
D447N, M469I, E478K, and R554K) resided outside of the
activation segment (Fig. 2B). Among these, S427 and D447 are
reminiscent of certain activating variants (S427G and I448V)
reported in patients with therapy-related acute myeloid leukemia (39). Moreover, E478K was previously characterized as
an activating variant in a human colorectal carcinoma cell line
and was also found to heterodimerize constitutively with BRAFE586K in a manner that increased kinase activity (25, 40). In
the aggregate, these ﬁndings suggest that the C-RAF mutations
may enact both predicted and novel biochemical mechanisms
of resistance to RAF inhibition.

A subset of C-RAF resistance alleles confers
pharmacologic resistance to RAF inhibitors
Next, the ability of biochemically validated C-RAF alleles to
confer pharmacologic resistance to RAF inhibitors was examined by expressing the relevant cDNAs within A375 cells and
conducting cell growth inhibition assays. In contrast to the BRAFV600E secondary mutations described above, 3 C-RAF
alleles conferred profound resistance to both the tool compound PLX4720 and the structurally homologous clinical RAF
inhibitor, vemurafenib (Fig. 3A and B). The S257P and P261T
variants in the CR2 domain 14-3-3 binding region produced the
most dramatic resistance effects (IC50 values were not reached
at the 10 mmol/L drug concentration; Fig. 3A and B). The G361A
variant (ATP-binding domain) also conferred >100-fold resistance to these RAF inhibitors compared with the wild-type CRAF (IC50 ¼ 0.1–0.4 mmol/L). The remaining variants exhibited
modest (if any) effects on the A375 IC50 values (as exempliﬁed
by G356E and D447N), although E478K induced a discernible
elevation of the "tail" of the PLX4720 IC50 curve (Fig. 3A).

Moreover, only one allele (G361A) conferred any evidence of
pharmacologic resistance to MEK inhibition (Supplementary
Fig. S3A and S3B). Thus, some but not all of the biochemically
validated C-RAF resistance alleles conferred substantial pharmacologic resistance to RAF inhibitors in BRAFV600E melanoma cells.
C-RAF resistance alleles enable paradoxical C-RAF
activation
To explore the mechanisms by which C-RAF mutations
conferred resistance to small-molecule RAF inhibitors, biochemical studies were conducted to assess relative RAF/MEK/
ERK activation across a representative panel of mutations at
baseline and following exposure to 2 mmol/L RAF inhibitor (in
this case, PLX4720). This concentration of RAF inhibitor was
sufﬁcient to achieve suppression of MEK/ERK phosphorylation in parental A375 cells and in those expressing wild-type CRAF (Fig. 3C and Supplementary Fig. S2B). At baseline, C-RAF
was inactive in both the presence and absence of PLX4720

based on serine 338 (S338) phosphorylation (Fig. 3C), as
reported previously in the B-RAFV600E context (12). Ectopic
expression of C-RAF resistance alleles enabled sustained pMEK and p-ERK (albeit moderately reduced) in the presence of
2 mmol/L PLX4720 (Fig. 3C). Moreover, the pharmacologically
validated alleles (S257P, P261T, and G361A) showed evidence
of C-RAF activation in the presence of PLX4720, as evidenced
by increased p-C-RAF (S338) and a slight enhancement of pMEK levels (Fig. 3C). This C-RAF activation of MEK/ERK
signaling was suppressed by pharmacologic MEK inhibition
(Supplementary Fig. S3A and S3B). Paradoxical activation of
MEK/ERK signaling by selective RAF inhibitors has been
described in the setting of activated RAS (24, 25) and ectopic
C-RAF overexpression (12); however, somatic C-RAF point
mutations that promote paradoxical, inhibitor-induced signaling have not previously been reported. Thus, C-RAF mutations
that enable drug-induced kinase activation may promote
resistance to RAF inhibitors.
Paradoxical MEK/ERK activation induced by RAF inhibitors
involves dimerization of RAF proteins (24, 25). Moreover, a
truncated form of B-RAFV600E that shows enhanced dimerization confers resistance to RAF inhibitors (19). To determine
whether the C-RAF resistance mutations might mediate resistance through increased dimerization, cotransfections were
conducted in 293/T cells using expression constructs in which
several representative C-RAF resistance alleles were differentially tagged with 2 distinct epitopes (His/V5 or Flag). Immunoprecipitation reactions were carried out using Ni2þ beads (to
capture the His-tagged protein) followed by immunoblotting
using anti-Flag antibody. In these experiments, all C-RAF
mutations that conferred pharmacologic resistance to RAF

inhibitors also exhibited robust homodimerization compared
with wild-type C-RAF (S257P, P261T, G361A, and E478K; Fig.
4A). For these mutants, dimerization generally correlated with
both increased total C-RAF expression and increased p-MEK
levels (Fig. 4A, input lysate). Similar results were observed
when His/V5-tagged C-RAF mutants were cotransfected with
Flag-tagged wild-type C-RAF (Supplementary Fig. S4A),
although the magnitude of MEK/ERK activation seemed qualitatively reduced (Supplementary Fig. S4A, input lysate). The 3
C-RAF mutants that conferred the most profound pharmacologic resistance to PLX4720 and vemurafenib (S257P, P261T,
and G361A; Fig. 3B and C) also showed evidence of increased
total protein accumulation (Fig. 4A, input lysate). Thus, the
resistance phenotype linked to C-RAF mutations correlated
with RAF expression and homodimerization. At present, we
cannot determine whether the increased C-RAF expression
associated with the resistance alleles is a cause or consequence
of enhanced homodimerization.
In 293/T cells (which lack oncogenic B-RAF mutations), the
C-RAF dimerization engendered by the presence of resistance
mutations was sustained but not further enhanced upon
exposure of transfected cells to RAF inhibitor (vemurafenib;
Fig. 4B). However, both C-RAF activation (evidenced by S338
phosphorylation) and downstream MEK/ERK signaling were
robustly induced by the RAF inhibitor (Fig. 4B, input lysate). To
determine the effects of these resistance mutations on intrinsic
C-RAF kinase activity, in vitro kinase reactions were conducted
from 293/T cells cultured in the presence or absence of RAF
inhibitor. In the absence of drug, steady-state C-RAF kinase
activity (p-MEK) was not measurably increased by the resistance mutations in most cases (Fig. 4C). C-RAFG361A was the

C-RAF Mutations Confer Resistance

Similar experiments in B-RAFV600E melanoma cells (A375)
revealed an increase in intrinsic kinase activity in the 3 most
potent C-RAF resistance mutants examined (S257P, P261T,
and G361A; Fig. 4D). This kinase activity was further augmented upon exposure of these cells to vemurafenib (Fig. 4D),
as observed in 293/T cells. As expected, A375 cells showed
elevated basal MEK phosphorylation that was inhibited by
vemurafenib (Fig. 4D). Together, these results suggested that
potent C-RAF resistance mutants enhanced RAF inhibitor–
mediated C-RAF kinase activity.

(Fig. 5B). In 293/T cells, the enhanced C-RAF/B-RAF heterodimerization triggered by C-RAF mutations correlated with CRAF protein stabilization and robust MEK/ERK phosphorylation (Fig. 5A). On the other hand, the robust MEK/ERK
activation observed in B-RAFV600E melanoma cells was only
marginally enhanced by the C-RAF resistance mutants (Fig.
5B); this result was expected given the constitutive oncogenic
B-RAF signaling in these cells. Interestingly, one of the C-RAF
mutants (G356E) exhibited very low 14-3-3z binding in both
cellular contexts (Fig. 5A and B)—the reason for this is
unknown. However, C-RAFG356E showed no enrichment in
B-RAF heterodimerization and no increase in MEK/ERK signaling under steady-state conditions. These results suggest
that while reduced 14-3-3 binding may promote enhanced
mutant C-RAF dimerization, some degree of 14-3-3 binding
(perhaps within the C-terminal domain) is needed to promote
maximal RAF-dependent signaling.
As expected, the RAF inhibitor vemurafenib induced B-RAF/
C-RAF heterodimerization in 293/T cells ectopically expressing
wild-type C-RAF (Fig. 5A) but abrogated this heterodimerization in A375 melanoma cells (Fig. 5B). In contrast, ectopic
expression of the most robust C-RAF resistance mutants
enabled sustained B-RAF heterodimerization even in the presence of drug in A375 cells (Fig. 5B). These results suggest that BRAFV600E may assume a dominant conformation that favors
heterodimerization with resistance-associated C-RAF variants.
Pharmacologic RAF inhibition had variable effects on the 14-33/C-RAF interaction depending on the cellular genetic context.
In A375 cells (BRAFV600E), vemurafenib modestly decreased the
14-3-3 zeta isoform (14-3-3 z) binding to wild-type C-RAF but

C-RAF resistance mutants exhibit reduced 14-3-3
binding and increased B-RAF heterodimerization
The cumulative data above suggested that C-RAF mutations
encompassing its 14-3-3 consensus binding site (S257P and
P261T) and the ATP-binding region of the P loop (G361A)
conferred pharmacologic and biochemical resistance to RAF
inhibition, enhanced RAF dimerization, and increased C-RAF
kinase activation upon treatment with RAF inhibitors. To
investigate the role of 14-3-3 protein binding in relation to
RAF dimerization, immunoprecipitation experiments were
carried out from cells engineered to ectopically express C-RAF
resistance alleles. To examine the effects of pharmacologic RAF
inhibition on 14-3-3 binding and B-RAF heterodimerization,
these experiments were carried out in both the absence and
presence of RAF inhibition (in this case, vemurafenib). In the
absence of RAF inhibitor, the C-RAF resistance alleles S257P,
P261T, and G361A tended to show reduced interactions with
14-3-3z and increased interactions with B-RAF in 293/T cells
(Fig. 5A) and, in particular, A375 (B-RAFV600E) melanoma cells

Figure 6. C-RAF resistance mutants require dimerization for MEK/ERK signaling. A, constructs expressing either Flag-tagged, wild-type C-RAF, or the

had no effect in the setting of the C-RAFS257P, C-RAFP261T, and
C-RAFG361A mutants (Fig. 5B). On the other hand, vemurafenib
enhanced these 14-3-3/C-RAF interactions in 293/T cells (Fig.
5A). These ﬁndings lent further support to the premise that the
resistance phenotype conferred by these C-RAF mutants in the
B-RAFV600E context involved enhanced RAF dimerization,
which correlated with diminished 14-3-3/C-RAF interactions.
Enhanced MEK/ERK signaling by C-RAF resistance
mutants requires dimerization
To test whether C-RAF dimerization is necessary for the
enhanced MEK/ERK signaling conferred by C-RAF resistance
mutants, an arginine–histidine mutation was introduced at
residue R401 (Fig. 1C; C-RAFR401H; Supplementary Fig. S4B).
This mutant has previously been shown to disrupt C-RAF
homodimerization (24, 25). We introduced the R401H dimerization deﬁcient mutation into the respective C-RAF resistance
alleles. As expected, C-RAF double mutants were rendered
largely incapable of enhanced MEK/ERK signaling (Fig. 6A).
Next, cotransfections were conducted using differentially epitope-tagged C-RAF resistance/R401H double mutants. As
described earlier, the C-RAF resistance alleles augmented CRAF homodimerization in a manner unaffected by RAF inhibitor (Fig. 6B). In contrast, introduction of the R401H allele
suppressed C-RAF homodimerization and abrogated MEK/
ERK signaling in most C-RAF mutant contexts examined. The
exception to this was the C-RAFG361A allele, which exhibited
constitutive (albeit markedly reduced) MEK/ERK activation
that was further induced by vemurafenib exposure, even when
coexpressed with the dimerization-deﬁcient double mutant.

4848

Cancer Res; 73(15) August 1, 2013

Together with the in vitro kinase activity results above, these
data suggest that the C-RAFG361A/R401H allele may also contain
increased intrinsic kinase activity. Overall, these results provide direct evidence that the enhanced MEK/ERK signaling
conferred by C-RAF resistance mutants requires RAF dimerization. They may also provide a rationale for the future
development of allosteric RAF inhibitors that disrupt the RAF
dimerization interface.

Discussion
In this study, we present the results of random mutagenesis
screens for mutations in B-RAFV600E and C-RAF that confer
resistance to small-molecule RAF inhibitors. Secondary mutations (or gene ampliﬁcations) affecting the target oncoprotein
comprise a common mechanism of resistance to several
targeted anticancer agents. In this regard, the power of in
vitro mutagenesis approaches to identify clinically relevant,
target-based mechanisms of resistance to kinase oncoprotein
inhibitors has long been recognized. Studies of Abl kinase
mutations that confer imatinib resistance were among the
ﬁrst to reveal the use of this approach. These efforts were
followed by similar mutagenesis-based queries of the Flt3
receptor tyrosine kinase (41). More recent studies by our group
in B-RAFV600E melanoma leveraged this mutagenesis approach
(expanded in scope through massively parallel sequencing of
resistant clones) to identify mutations in the MEK1 kinase that
confer resistance to MEK or RAF inhibitors. Several MEK1
mutations have since been found in melanomas that progressed following treatment with these agents (11, 17). This

C-RAF Mutations Confer Resistance

work therefore provided an early example of mutations situated downstream of the target oncoprotein that re-activate the
salient pathway to produce resistance.
B-RAFV600E melanoma has thus far proved unusual in that
secondary B-RAF point mutations have yet to be described as a
clinical means of resistance to RAF inhibitors (although B-RAF
ampliﬁcation has been observed; ref. 20). The results of our
B-RAFV600E mutagenesis screen suggest that secondary BRAFV600E mutations are plausible in principle; however, the
ability of such mutations to confer profound resistance
remains obscure. Indeed, only 1 of the 3 putative B-RAFV600E
resistance alleles identiﬁed by random mutagenesis produced
sustained MEK/ERK signaling upon re-expression and challenge with a selective RAF inhibitor, and none engendered
pharmacologic resistance to drug-sensitive B-RAFV600E melanoma cells based on growth inhibition assays. While these
results certainly do not exclude the possibility that secondary
B-RAFV600E resistance mutations might eventually be observed
in relapsing melanoma specimens, they also support the
premise that this speciﬁc mechanism may be less favored
clinically. For example, it is conceivable that further elevations
in intrinsic B-RAF kinase activity (already rendered several
100-fold more active that wild-type B-RAF by the V600E/K
mutation) may be detrimental to the growth of melanoma
cells. Alternatively, some point mutations that disrupt drug
binding may prove antagonistic to overall oncogenic B-RAF
signaling (e.g., the secondary V528F mutation identiﬁed herein). Additional mutagenesis studies that include both oncogenic and wild-type B-RAF may provide additional insights
into target-based alterations that affect resistance to RAF
inhibitors.
In light of these observations, the discovery of C-RAF resistance mutations is noteworthy as the ﬁrst demonstration of
any RAF family point mutation capable of conferring robust
pharmacologic resistance to small-molecule RAF inhibitors in
a B-RAFV600E melanoma cell context. A prior study focusing on
B-RAF gatekeeper alleles showed that such mutations could
modify sensitivity to PLX4720; however, these experiments
queried interleukin (IL)-3–independent growth in a Ba/F3 cell
system (35). C-RAF is typically not required for melanoma cell
viability in the setting of B-RAFV600E (26, 42, 43), although it
may become engaged in melanoma cells that contain nonV600E B-RAF mutations (22). Several C-RAF resistance
mutants described here potentiate C-RAF kinase activity,
downstream MEK/ERK signaling, and paradoxical augmentation by RAF inhibitors in the absence of upstream RAS activation (Supplementary Fig. S5). Despite their distinct locations
within the C-RAF protein, they may converge onto a common
resistance mechanism that favors the adoption of a dimerization-competent protein conformation. Given that the G361A
mutation resides immediately adjacent to the P loop—next to
the drug-binding region, this mutation may perturb the conformation of the DFG motif in a manner that potentiates an
active kinase conformation. Although the C-RAF structure
spanning the S257P and P261T mutations (including the CR2
14-3-3 binding region) has not yet been solved, our results
strongly suggest that these mutations also promote a conformation that favors dimerization. Indeed, our experiments that

www.aacrjournals.org

incorporated a dimerization-deﬁcient C-RAF mutant conﬁrmed that these resistance alleles required dimerization for
enhanced MEK/ERK signaling.
Multiple published studies have shown that 14-3-3 protein
binding plays an important role in the regulation of RAF kinase
activity (22, 29, 44). The 3 potent C-RAF resistance mutants
identiﬁed in this study exhibit reduced (but not absent) 14-3-3
binding, which, in turn, is associated with increased RAF
dimerization. In all cases, the end result is enhanced MEK/
ERK signaling, consistent with prior studies that endorse the
importance of C-RAF dimerization in MAPK pathway activation (24, 25). Overall, these results support a biphasic model for
14-3-3/C-RAF interactions wherein "full" C-RAF/14-3-3 interactions (involving both the CR-2 and C-terminal domains) may
constrain C-RAF activity, but disruption of CR2-dependent 143-3 binding favors a C-RAF conformation that is permissive for
enhanced RAF dimerization and (RAF inhibitor–inducible)
kinase activity.
Of course, the gold standard for any study of anticancer drug
resistance involves a demonstration that mechanisms identiﬁed experimentally are also operant in relapsing tumors. To
date, C-RAF point mutations have not been linked to either de
novo or acquired clinical resistance to RAF inhibitors (although
it remains unclear to what extent C-RAF sequencing has been
conducted in this setting). However, it has become clear that
somatic C-RAF mutations may contribute to melanoma biology in some settings. In particular, the C-RAFE478K mutation
described here was previously reported in a colorectal cancer
cell line that exhibited hypersensitivity to oncogenic RAS
activation in vitro (40). This mutation, which is analogous to
BRAFE586K (3, 40), has also been found in gastric, lung, and
breast cancer cell lines (45). More recently, we also identiﬁed
the C-RAFE478K mutation in a melanoma tumor that is wild
type for both B-RAF and N-RAS (Supplementary Fig. S6; ref. 46),
which is consistent with increased heterodimerization of this
mutant with B-RAF leading to increased kinase activity under
steady state (Figs. 4A and 5A). In the aggregate, our ﬁndings
raise the tantalizing possibility that resistance-associated CRAF mutations might yet be discovered—especially as the
activity of such mutants becomes enhanced in the presence
of RAF inhibitors. However, such speculation must be tempered by the fact that the 3 most potent resistance alleles
described in this work cannot arise by the most common UVassociated base mutations (e.g., C-to-T transitions cannot
generate the relevant amino acid substitutions at codons
257, 261, and 361). Undoubtedly, whole-exome sequencing of
large numbers of treatment-refractory melanomas will prove
highly informative in this regard, particularly as more potent
RAF inhibitors progress through clinical development.
In conclusion, we have used random mutagenesis and
biochemical studies to identify mutations in C-RAF that confer
resistance to RAF inhibitors. These results have provided new
insights into biochemical mechanisms that promote C-RAF
dimerization and paradoxical MAPK pathway activation by
RAF inhibitors (even in the absence of an upstream oncogenic
module). Such knowledge may anticipate new therapeutic
resistance mechanisms and speed the design of "next-generation" ATP-competitive or allosteric RAF inhibitors that
