BACKGROUND: Antiepidermal growth factor receptor (anti-EGFR) monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs) are indicated for
the treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer patients, but some scientific issues concerning their efficacy are currently unsolved. METHODS: A literature-based meta-analysis was conducted. Hazard ratios (HRs) were extracted
from randomized trials for progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS); the event-based risk ratio was
derived for response. Sensitivity analyses to look for interactions according to KRAS status and chemotherapy association regimens were performed. RESULTS: Eight trials (6609 patients) were identified. A significant interaction
according to KRAS status was found for PFS (wild type vs mutant, P ¼ .001) and response rate (wild type vs mutant,
P < .0001). The addition of an anti-EGFR MoAb to first-line chemotherapy increased PFS in the KRAS wild-type population (HR, 0.91; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.84-0.99; P ¼ .03), and had a detrimental effect in the KRAS mutant
population (HR, 1.13; 95% CI, 1.03-1.25; P ¼ .013). A significant increase in the probability of achieving a response was
evident in KRAS wild-type patients (relative risk, 1.17; 95% CI, 1.04-1.33; P ¼ .011). In this population, the interaction in
response rate according to adopted chemotherapy favored irinotecan-containing regimens (P ¼ .01), and at metaregression analysis the relative increase in response rate was significantly related to PFS (P ¼ .00001) and OS (P ¼
.00193) benefit. CONCLUSIONS: The addition of an anti-EGFR MoAb to first-line chemotherapy produces a clear benefit in response rate. This advantage is restricted to KRAS wild-type patients and translates into a small benefit in
PFS. At present, irinotecan-based backbone chemotherapy could be a preferable option. The correlation between activity and survival parameters corroborates the hypothesis that anti-EGFR MoAbs might be more suitable for patients

INTRODUCTION
In recent years, medical oncologists facing metastatic colorectal cancer (MCRC) patients put their trust in the awaited clinical
results of biologic agents such as bevacizumab and the 2 anti-epidermal growth factor receptor (anti-EGFR) monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs), cetuximab and panitumumab. Nevertheless, these molecularly targeted drugs produced only a marginal effect
on survival outcomes.1 After their commercialization, 3 substantial findings derived from clinical and translational trials have

influenced therapeutic algorithms: 1) patients affected by
KRAS mutant tumors do not benefit from anti-EGFR
MoAbs,2 2) KRAS mutations do not affect response to bevacizumab or other molecular determinants,3-5 and 3) the concomitant inhibition of EGFR and vascular endothelial
growth factor (VEGF) seems not to produce any advantage.
These considerations lead to the question of which biologic
agent should be used up-front as the best companion for traditional chemotherapy in the treatment of KRAS wild-type
patients, and head-to-head comparative studies addressing
this issue are ongoing.6 At present, the therapeutic choice
should be guided by traditional clinical considerations (ie,
toxicity profile, physicians’ experience, patients’ preferences)
integrated with the most accurate estimation of each drug’s
efficacy. For this last purpose, meta-analyses might provide a
useful tool. This need has been recently satisfied for bevacizumab by 4 distinct original publications,7-10 whereas up to
now there have been no published meta-analyses investigating the impact of adding an anti-EGFR MoAb to first-line
chemotherapy for MCRC. Results from randomized trials of
chemotherapy plus or minus an anti-EGFR MoAb seem to
be relatively heterogeneous and inconsistent, especially in
terms of progression-free survival (PFS), and there have been
even fewer data on overall survival (OS); second, it has been
proposed that anti-EGFR MoAbs could be a preferable
option when achieving tumoral shrinkage is the main objective of the treatment,11 and therefore it is essential to estimate
the magnitude of this effect and how this approach is consistent with global scientific evidence; third, the interaction
between KRAS status and the effect in terms of PFS lengthening of first-line anti-EGFR MoAbs has not yet been formally
proven, but most important, not clearly estimated; moreover,
a possible association preference with irinotecan-based chemotherapy has been suggested but never demonstrated, and an
eventual detrimental effect of combining cetuximab or panitumumab with oxaliplatin-containing chemotherapy in
KRAS mutant tumors has been observed by some studies and
not confirmed in others.
We therefore conducted the present literature-based
meta-analysis for answering all the abovementioned questions, thus providing medical oncologists and researchers
with an actual perspective and formal support useful for
clinical decision making and for guiding new experimental approaches.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
The analysis was conducted according to 4 prespecified
steps: 1) definition of the outcomes (definition of the

1524

question the analysis was designed to answer); 2) definition of the trial selection criteria; 3) definition of the
search strategy; and 4) detailed description of the statistical methods used.12,13
Outcome Definition
The analysis was conducted to assess the effect of the addition of an anti-EGFR MoAb to first-line chemotherapy
within 3 featured scenarios: 1) in the context of the whole
unselected population, regardless of KRAS status; 2) in the
group of patients without KRAS mutation (ie, wild type);
and 3) in the group of patients carrying KRAS mutation.
Treatment with an anti-EGFR MoAb was considered as
the experimental arm and chemotherapy alone as the
standard arm. Primary outcome was PFS; secondary endpoints included OS and overall response rate (ORR), as
reported by investigators.
Search Strategy
Deadline for trial publication and/or presentation was
November 30th, 2010. Full reports and updates of
randomized clinical trials (RCTs) that compared a firstline treatment with an anti-EGFR MoAb plus chemotherapy versus chemotherapy alone in MCRC patients were
gathered through Medline (PubMed: www.ncbi.nlm.nih.
gov/PubMed), American Society of Clinical Oncology
(ASCO, www.asco.org), and European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO, www.esmo.org) website searches.
Keywords used for searching were: metastatic colorectal
cancer, cetuximab, panitumumab, chemotherapy, firstline, phase 2, phase 3, randomized, and anti-EGFR
monoclonal antibody. In addition to computer browsing, review and original papers were also scanned in the
reference section to look for missing trials. Furthermore,
lectures at major meetings (ASCO, ASCO-Gastrointestinal Symposium, ESMO, and ECCO (European CanCer Organisation) having MCRC as the topic were
checked.
Trial Identification Criteria
All prospective RCTs published in peer-reviewed journals or presented at the ASCO, ASCO-Gastrointestinal
Symposium, ECCO, and ESMO meetings up to November 2010 in which previously untreated patients
affected by MCRC were prospectively randomized to
receive anti-EGFR MoAbs plus chemotherapy versus
chemotherapy alone were considered.

Data Extraction
Data for primary and secondary endpoints were extracted;
the last available update of each trial was considered as the
original source. Data for each explored outcome were
extracted from trials in the context of the following populations: 1) patients unselected for KRAS mutation (KRAS
unselected, where outcomes were derived including all
randomized patients regardless of KRAS status); 2) KRAS
wild-type patients, and 3) KRAS mutant patients. All data
were reviewed by 3 investigators (L.S., C.C., and F.L.)
and separately computed by 4 investigators (V.V., F.Cu.,
D.G., and E.B.).13
Data Synthesis
Hazard ratios (HRs) for PFS and OS with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were extracted from papers and/or
presentations14-16; event-based relative risks (RRs) and
cumulative ratios with 95% CIs were determined for
ORR.17 The number of patients needed to treat (NNT)
for a single patient to benefit was determined (NNT ¼ 1/
[(absolute difference)/100]).18-20 To weigh for unknown
heterogeneity, the cumulative effect measure was performed according to both a fixed-effect and a randomeffect model (DerSimonian and Laird method)21; a heterogeneity test was used as well.14

Cancer

March 15, 2012

A sensitivity analysis, to look for interaction, according to the adopted oxaliplatin-containing or irinotecancontaining chemotherapy regimen was performed on the
basis of the fixed-effect analysis. In all figures the derived
results are reported as conventional meta-analysis forest
plots, with an HR/RR <1.0 indicating fewer events in the
experimental arm.
To explore the eventual correlation between ORR
and significant outcomes, a meta-regression analysis was
performed (ie, regression of the RR of the ORR on the log
HR of PFS and/or OS). Calculations were accomplished
using Comprehensive Meta-Analysis Software, version
2.0 (Biostat, Englewood, NJ).

RESULTS
Selected Trials
Eight trials (6609 patients) were identified (Fig. 1).22-30
Selected trials are listed in Table 1; 1 study was designed

Primary Outcome
A significant interaction according to KRAS status was
found for PFS (wild-type vs mutant, P ¼ .001) (Fig. 2,
Table 2). A significant advantage in favor of the addition
of the anti-EGFR MoAb was found in KRAS wild-type
populations (HR, 0.91; 95% CI, 0.84-0.99; P ¼ .03),
although with significant heterogeneity (P < .001); this
difference was no longer significant, when the randomeffect model was adopted (HR, 0.92; 95% CI, 0.76-1.12;
P ¼ .40) (Fig. 2B). Conversely, a detrimental effect from
the addition of the anti-EGFR MoAb was found in KRAS
mutant populations (fixed-effect model: HR, 1.13; 95%
CI, 1.03-1.25; P ¼ .013; random-effect model: HR, 1.15;
95%CI, 0.98-1.35; P ¼ .086), with borderline heterogeneity (P ¼ .056) (Fig. 2A). No significant differences were
found in KRAS unselected populations (Fig. 2C).
A significant interaction according to the chemotherapy regimen in favor of irinotecan in terms of PFS was
evident in KRAS unselected populations (P ¼ .011),
although in this group the addition of the anti-EGFR

1526

MoAb did not significantly improve outcome (P ¼ .75)
(Table 3).
P value of the interaction test for PFS according to
chemotherapy regimen in KRAS wild-type populations
was .063 (Table 3).
Secondary Outcomes
With respect to OS, no significant differences nor interactions were found in any analyzed population according to
KRAS status (Table 2). A significant interaction according
to the chemotherapy regimen in favor of irinotecan in
terms of OS was found (P ¼ .023) only in KRAS unselected populations.
A significant interaction according to KRAS status
was found for ORR (wild type vs mutant, P < .0001)
(Fig. 3, Table 2). A significant advantage in favor of the
addition of an anti-EGFR MoAb was found in KRAS
wild-type populations, with an increase in the RR of 17%
(random-effect model: RR, 1.17; 95% CI, 1.04-1.33;
P ¼ .011), with significant heterogeneity (P ¼ .003) (Fig.
3B). In KRAS mutant populations, the RR was 0.91 (95%
CI, 0.83-1.01), P ¼ .082, according to fixed-effect model
(P value for heterogeneity ¼ .27) (Fig. 3A). A significant
relative 8% benefit in ORR in favor of the addition of
the anti-EGFR MoAb was evident in KRAS unselected
populations, with borderline heterogeneity (P ¼ .059)
(Fig. 3C).
The cumulative ORR was significantly increased by
the addition of the anti-EGFR MoAb, with an absolute
difference of 8.7% and 4.3% in KRAS wild-type and
KRAS unselected populations, respectively, and a significant interaction according to KRAS status (P < .0001)

An interaction according to the chemotherapy regimen in favor of irinotecan in terms of ORR was found in
KRAS wild-type populations (P ¼ .01), with a significant
relative benefit in favor of the addition of the anti-EGFR
MoAb of 34% (P ¼ .008) and no heterogeneity (P ¼ .21)
(Table 3).
Meta-Regression Analysis
In KRAS wild-type and KRAS unselected populations, the
increase in ORR was significantly related to PFS (P ¼
.00001, Fig. 5A; P ¼ .0001, Fig. 5C) and OS benefit
(P ¼ .00193, Fig. 5D; P ¼ .0027, Fig. 5F). A less significant correlation between the increase in ORR and PFS
was found in KRAS mutant populations (P ¼ .01398, Fig.
5B); no correlation in terms of OS was found (P ¼ .254,
Fig. 5E).

DISCUSSION
Nowadays, treatment of MCRC with anti-EGFR MoAbs
represents one of those ‘‘special cases’’ in clinical oncology
for which molecular selection is a reality. Since their introduction, it has been rapidly noticed that EGFR expression
was not predictive of benefit, and conversely evidence has

emerged that tumors bearing a KRAS-activating mutation
were resistant to the treatment.
Nevertheless, KRAS status has entered clinical practice on the basis of retrospective data from both historical
series and phase 3 randomized trial populations, supported by a strong biologic rationale, but in the absence of
formal validating proof. Considering both pragmatic and
ethical issues, conducting prospective randomized phase 3
trials with an interaction design is rather unlikely. As suggested by Buyse and coworkers, meta-analysis represents a

reliable statistical instrument, able to provide a robust
confirmation of a marker’s predictive role.31 Moreover, in
recent months unexpected results from COIN,26 the largest phase 3 study evaluating the addition of cetuximab to
first-line chemotherapy, and the NORDIC trial27 have
partially challenged clinicians’ convictions about antiEGFR MoAbs’ efficacy, and scant results in the KRAS
wild-type group might indirectly weaken their confidence
in KRAS predictive strength. Even if the chemotherapy
backbone adopted in those 2 trials could have affected the
results, in an exploratory analysis from the COIN trial, an
improvement in PFS with cetuximab was evident in
patients receiving 5-fluorouracil-based treatment, but not
in those treated with capecitabine-based therapy.
The results of our meta-analysis definitively prove
the interaction of KRAS status with clinical outcome in
terms of both RR (P < .0001) and PFS (P ¼ .001), thus
providing a formal demonstration that the benefit from
anti-EGFR MoAbs is restricted to patients with KRAS
wild-type disease. More relevantly, our meta-analysis provides a clear estimation of the magnitude of clinical benefit from first-line anti-EGFR MoAbs, confirming a
significant advantage in terms of ORR (RR, 1.17; 95%
CI, 1.09-1.24; P < .001) and PFS (HR, 0.911; 95% CI,
0.837-0.991; P ¼ .030) among KRAS wild-type patients.
Despite this, it should be noticed that when considering

the heterogeneity among included studies, the significant
advantage in ORR does not translate into an evident
advantage in PFS (HR, 0.92; 95% CI, 0.76-1.12; P ¼
.403). Consistently with such results, the addition of an
anti-EGFR MoAb does not provide a significant benefit
also in terms of OS (HR, 0.95; 95% CI, 0.87-1.04; P ¼
.34). Nonetheless, it should be considered that there are at
least 2 well-known factors that influence the correlation
between first-line treatment effect and OS results in
MCRC: secondary surgical resections of metastases and
subsequent lines of treatment. Our study is limited by its
own nature of being literature-based; individual patients’
data could better deal with these issues.
This meta-analysis was conducted for the main purpose of assessing the benefit in terms of PFS of adding an
anti-EGFR MoAb to any other standard treatment, and
all retrieved eligible studies were included. Despite that, it
should be noted that some concerns were raised about a
possible negative interaction between bevacizumab and
anti-EGFR MoAbs. Therefore, we performed an exploratory analysis excluding the PACCE and the CAIRO trials;
in KRAS wild-type patients, the effect of anti-EGFRs was
slightly more evident (HR, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.58-0.94; P ¼
.001) with a trend toward improvement in OS not
reaching statistical significance (HR, 0.94; 95% CI, 0.841.01; P ¼ .067).
Cumulative analysis of activity data highlights a considerable increase in ORR related to the addition of antiEGFR MoAb in KRAS wild-type populations (57.2%
[95% CI, 54.7%-59.6%] vs 48.5% [95% CI, 46.1%50.9%]). The clinical impact of molecular selection in terms
of responses is even more visible by the NNT analysis, which
demonstrates that 23 unselected patients should be treated
to obtain a benefit in 1 patient, whereas this number falls to
11 when only KRAS wild-type patients are treated.
Interestingly, the meta-regression analysis correlating survival parameters with the RR of response suggests
that in the KRAS wild-type group a greater benefit from
anti-EGFR MoAbs is observed in those studies in which a
higher RR of response is reported (PFS: P ¼ .00001; OS:
P ¼ .00193). Among KRAS mutant patients, this relationship is much less significant with regard to PFS (P ¼
.01398) and insignificant with regard to OS (P ¼ .254),
thus confirming that such correlation might be emphasized by the effect of the anti-EGFR. This observation,
coupled with the relation of higher tumor shrinkage with
longer PFS and OS, reported among KRAS wild-type
patients treated with folinic acid, fluorouracil, and irinotecan plus cetuximab in the CRYSTAL trial,32 corroborates

1530

the hypothesis that those patients actually obtaining tumor shrinkage benefit more from anti-EGFR MoAbs also
in terms of survival.
Such considerations as well as the specific aim of the
treatment (tumoral shrinkage vs progression delay vs palliation) cannot be neglected when choosing the biologic
agent to be combined with first-line chemotherapy in
patients with KRAS wild-type disease, as we wait for the
results of head-to-head comparative studies, such as the
intergroup trial CALGB 80405. In a retrospective analysis
comparing the waterfall plot of 2 randomized phase 2
studies of capecitabine plus oxaliplatin or capecitabine
plus irinotecan with cetuximab or bevacizumab, the activity of cetuximab as measured by the average and the median reduction in tumor burden seemed to be greater than
that of bevacizumab (average, 38.9% vs 29.9%; median,
35% vs 30%; P ¼ .009).33 At the same time, the meta-analytical estimation of the benefit from bevacizumab shows
that the antiangiogenic agent mainly exerts its function by
delaying tumor progression, rather than by determining a
substantial tumoral shrinkage.9,10 The meaningful property of cetuximab as a shrinking agent makes its use particularly suitable in those settings where the treatment’s
primary objective lies in inducing a rapid response, as in
the case of patients with potentially resectable disease, but
also in those with never resectable, widespread, biologically aggressive, symptomatic disease.
With regard to the best chemotherapy companion
of anti-EGFR MoAbs, in KRAS wild-type population we
observed a significant interaction in terms of ORR (P ¼
.01) and a borderline significance in terms of both PFS
(P ¼ .063) and OS (P ¼ .06) that is strongly conditioned
by the high heterogeneity between CRYSTAL23 and the
irinotecan cohort of the PACCE trial.28 Even if the
hypothesis that oxaliplatin-based regimens might not represent an optimal backbone for the addition of the antiEGFR is not definitively confirmed, we believe that, on
the basis of present results and in the absence of specific
contraindications, irinotecan-based regimens could be
preferred in daily practice. To this extent, attention
should be paid to reports indicating a possible indirect
correlation between irinotecan and 90-day mortality after
surgery for liver metastases in patients experiencing steatohepatitis,34 although more recent and wider studies
reduced these fears, suggesting that a prolonged period of
preoperative treatment may be the most important cause
of life-threatening toxicities.35
In conclusion, we believe that the present results further strengthen the crucial importance of patient selection

Anti-EGFRs in MCRC: A Meta-Analysis/Loupakis et al

in optimizing the choice of anti-EGFR moAbs as up-front
biologic agents. The KRAS story teaches how necessary it
is to collect biologic material from the vast majority of
patients enrolled in clinical trials. In the hope of identifying in the near future new molecular predictors able to
improve the magnitude of the benefit from EGFR inhibition in KRAS wild-type patients, and as we await ongoing
RCTs, the choice of first-line anti-EGFR should be driven
by the abovementioned clinical considerations. Several
studies36-38 have investigated the possible role of BRAF
V600E mutation in predicting resistance to anti-EGFR
MoAbs. Data deriving from chemorefractory patients
seem to be clearer than those from first-line trials,39 even
if interaction analyses from randomized studies are limited in power by the relatively rare incidence of such molecular alteration (about 8%). At the same time, such
studies have clarified definitively the strong prognostic
adverse impact of BRAF mutation.39 Regarding future
directions for researchers, it should be taken into account
that a retrospective study40 and a specific pooled analysis
from the CRYSTAL and OPUS trials41 suggested that
cetuximab may provide therapeutic benefit in patients
affected by tumors with a relatively rare KRAS mutation,
G13D underlining how different KRAS mutations produce distinct biologic effects. However, such preliminary
evidence is not solid enough to modify clinical attitudes
and should be verified in prospective studies. Other
appropriately designed trials might explore the appealing
strategy of integrating both biologic agents in the first-line
treatment of MCRC, exploiting the shrinking property of
anti-EGFR MoAbs in an initial induction phase and the
progression-delaying property of anti-VEGF MoAbs in a
following maintenance phase.
