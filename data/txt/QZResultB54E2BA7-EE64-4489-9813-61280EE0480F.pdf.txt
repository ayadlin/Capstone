BACKGROUND: Enzalutamide (Enz) and abiraterone acetate (AA) are hormone treatments that have a proven survival advantage in
patients with metastatic, castration-resistant prostate cancer who previously received docetaxel (Doc). Recently, limited activity of
AA after Enz and of Enz after AA was demonstrated in small cohort studies. Here, the authors present the activity and tolerability of
Enz in patients who previously received AA and Doc in the largest cohort to date. METHODS: The efficacy and tolerability of Enz
were investigated in men with progressive, metastatic, castrate-resistant prostate cancer who previously received Doc and AA. Toxicity, progression-free survival, time to prostate-specific antigen (PSA) progression, and overall survival were retrospectively evaluated.
RESULTS: Sixty-one patients were included in the analysis. The median age was 69 years (interquartile range [IQR], 64-74 years), 57
patients (93%) had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status from 0 to 2, 48 patients (79%) had bone metastases,
33 patients (54%) had lymph node metastases, and 13 patients (21%) had visceral metastases. The median duration of Enz treatment
was 14.9 weeks (IQR, 11.1-20.0 weeks), and 13 patients (21%) had a maximum PSA decline 50%. The median progression-free survival
was 12.0 weeks (95% confidence interval [CI], 11.1-16.0 weeks), the median time to PSA progression was 17.4 weeks (95% CI, >16.0
weeks), and the median overall survival was 31.6 weeks (95% CI, >28.7 weeks). Enz was well tolerated, and fatigue and musculoskeletal pain were the most frequent grade 2 adverse events. The PSA response to Doc and AA did not predict the PSA response to
Enz. CONCLUSIONS: Enz has modest clinical activity in patients with metastatic, castrate-resistant prostate cancer who previously

INTRODUCTION
Prostate cancer is the most prevalent cancer among men in the western world and the second leading cause of male cancer
death.1,2 After an initial response to medical or surgical castration, the disease will progress into castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC).3 However, CRPC is still driven by androgen receptor (AR) signaling, requiring lower than castration
testosterone levels as a result of AR modulations.4-6 Therefore, new drugs have been developed that more effectively inhibit AR signaling. Enzalutamide (Enz) (MDV3100; Xtandi; comarketed by Astellas Pharma US, Inc. [Northbrook, Ill]
and Medivation, Inc. [San Francisco, Calif]), a novel nonsteroidal AR signaling inhibitor, has exhibited a survival advantage in patients with metastasized CRPC (mCRPC) who previously received docetaxel (Doc) in combination with prednisone.7 However, earlier, abiraterone acetate (AA) (Zytiga; Janssen Biotech, Inc., Horsham, Pa), an inhibitor of
testosterone synthesis, demonstrated a comparable survival advantage in combination with prednisone in the same patient
population.8 It is suggested that Enz and AA actions are nonoverlapping and, thus, are potentially synergistic.9 However,
only limited activity of AA was described in 2 cohort studies of patients who previously received Enz, and limited activity

of Enz was described in a single cohort of patients who
previously received AA.10-12 Knowledge of the clinical
cross-resistance in both sequences of these antihormonal
treatments is of value for future trial design.
Pending final registration of Enz in the Netherlands,
Astellas Pharma Europe Ltd. established an Expanded
Access Program (EAP) for patients with progressive disease who had no satisfactory alternative treatments available. Therefore, Enz treatment was positioned after Doc
and AA treatment. Here, we report the tolerability and efficacy of Enz in the largest cohort to date of patients with
mCRPC who previously received Doc and AA.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients and Treatment

In this multicenter, observational study, we included
patients with progressive mCRPC enrolled in the Dutch
EAP for ENZ who had previously received Doc and AA.
All patients either progressed on or did not tolerate AA
treatment and consented to join the program. Inclusion
criteria for the EAP included: effective surgical or medical
castration, progressive disease, an Eastern Cooperative
Oncology Group (ECOG) performance from 0 to 2, and
no satisfactory alternative treatment at the physician’s discretion. The exclusion criteria of the EAP included: earlier
treatment with or participation in a clinical trial with
ENZ; severe concurrent disease; inadequate bone marrow,
liver, vascular, heart, and kidney functions; and prior
chemotherapy, biologic therapy, or radiation therapy
within 3 weeks before treatment and radionucleotide
treatment 8 weeks before treatment.
Patients received Enz at a once-daily dose of 160
mg. All patients received at least 1 dose of Enz. Treatment
was continued until clinical deterioration, disease progression, and/or unacceptable adverse effects, all at the physician’s discretion or until death.
Study Procedures and Data Collection

Patient baseline characteristics were documented, including age, ECOG performance status, disease characteristics
(including Gleason score, involved metastatic sites, number of metastatic sites), blood test results (including hemoglobin concentration, liver chemistry tests, creatinine,
testosterone, and prostate-specific antigen [PSA]), clinical
signs of disease progression, previous antihormonal and
chemotherapy treatments (including duration of Doc and
AA treatment, best PSA response to Doc and AA treatment, and reason for AA discontinuation), and use of concomitant medication with known interaction with Enz

(macrolide antibiotics, benzodiazepines, immune modulators, antiepileptics, coumarins, colchicine, digoxin).
Clinical and biochemical activity and toxicity were
assessed at Enz treatment initiation and every month
according to the EAP protocol, including ECOG performance status and toxicity, which was recorded using
Common Toxicity Criteria (CTC), version 4.0. Imaging
studies were performed at the discretion of the physician.
Patients were followed for prostate cancer progression and
survival until April 2013.
PSA response was evaluated using the Prostate Cancer Clinical Trials Working Group 2 (PCWG2) recommendations.13 Progression-free survival (PFS) was
calculated from the time treatment started to the first date
of confirmed progression or the date of last follow-up.
Progression was defined as PSA progression, and/or radiographic progression, and/or clinical progression. PSA
response, as recommended by the PCWG2, was defined
as a decline 50% from baseline, and PSA progression
was defined as an increase of 25% and a minimum level of
2 ng/mL confirmed by a second PSA reading a minimum
of 3 weeks later. When no decline from baseline was documented, PSA progression was defined as an increase of
25% from baseline value along with an increase in absolute PSA value of at least 2 ng/mL after 12 weeks of treatment. PSA declines <30%, <50%, and <90% from
baseline after 12 weeks with or without conformation also
were evaluated. Objective responses were measured
according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid
Tumors.14 Bone progression based on bone scans was
assessed according to PCWG2 criteria. Progression after
initial response and no response as reasons for AA discontinuation were defined as PSA progression (PCWG2), radiographic or clinical progression after an initial PSA
response (PCWG2), or no PSA response, respectively.
Overall survival (OS) was calculated from the date Enz
treatment started to the date of death or last follow-up.
Informed consent was obtained from all patients before
enrolment into the EAP, and patients’ outcomes were analyzed with ethics committee approval.
Statistical Analysis

In line with PCWG2 criteria, waterfall plots with maximum PSA decline from baseline and PSA after 12 weeks
of treatment were constructed. Survival and progression
were evaluated using Kaplan-Meier estimates. Patients
who did not achieve a 50% decline in PSA on Doc or AA
were designated Doc nonsensitive or AA nonsensitive,
respectively; and patients who had a 50% decline in
PSA on Doc or AA treatment were designated Doc

sensitive or AA sensitive, respectively. The best PSA
responses on Enz were compared between subpopulations
of patients according to Doc and AA sensitivities using a
2-sample t test. The predictive power of the best Doc and
AA responses and their interaction for maximum PSA
decline on Enz were evaluated by means of linear regression using a log link. Statistical analyses were conducted
using Statistical Analysis System (SAS) statistical software
(SAS Institute Inc., Chicago, Ill) and R (R Foundation for
Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria).15

RESULTS
Patients

Starting in June 2012, an EAP for Enz was established in
the Netherlands. At the time the program was closed in
March 2013, 61 patients in 9 hospitals who were previously treated with both Doc and AA were evaluable for
treatment outcome and tolerability assessments. Patient
characteristics at the time of Enz treatment initiation are
summarized in Table 1. The median patient age before
starting Enz treatment was 69 years (interquartile range
[IQR], 64-74 years); the ECOG performance was 0 or 1
in 57% of patients and 2 in 36% of patients; and 79% of
patients had bone metastases, 54% had lymph node metastases, and the majority (93%) had more than 1 metastatic site. With respect to laboratory results, the median
hemoglobin concentration was 11.0 g/dL (IQR, 9.9-12.5
g/dL), the median alkaline phosphatase level was 191 U/L
(IQR, 100-288 U/L), and the median lactate dehydrogenase level was 241 U/L (IQR, 191-385 U/L) at the time of
Enz treatment initiation. Thirty-eight patients (70%) had
increased alkaline phosphatase levels, and 25 patients
(48%) had increased lactate dehydrogenase levels at baseline. Disease progression at the time of Enz treatment initiation presented in 95% of patients as PSA progression
and in 87% of patients as clinical progression and could
be confirmed in 57% of patients by a bone scan and in
30% of patients as progression of measurable lesions.
Ninety percent of patients received 1 course of Doc
treatment, whereas 10% received 2 or more courses. The
median number of cycles of Doc in all courses combined
was 8 (IQR, 6-10 cycles). Thirty percent of patients
received at least 1 course of cabazitaxel in combination
with prednisone. The median duration of AA treatment
was 26 weeks (IQR, 13-37 weeks), and the reason for AA
discontinuation was disease progression after initial
response in 54% and no initial response in 38% of
patients. All patients received a luteinizing hormonereleasing hormone antagonist/agonist or underwent

Antitumor Effects

Patients started Enz treatment a median of 60.7 weeks
(IQR, 36.6-78.2 weeks) after discontinuing Doc and 8.9
weeks (IQR, 4.3-28.9 weeks) after discontinuing AA (Table 2). The median duration of Enz treatment was 14.9
weeks (IQR, 11.1-20.0 weeks), and the median follow-up
was 16.3 weeks (IQR, 13.7-21.1 weeks). A maximum
PSA decline 30% was observed in 28 patients (46%), a
PSA decline 50% was observed in 13 patients (21%),
and a PSA decline 90% was observed in 2 patients (3%)
(Fig. 1). The maximum PSA decline was reached after a
median of 5.0 weeks (IQR, 4.0-8.6 weeks). Eighteen
patients (30%) had no PSA response at any time. For each
patient, we collected the PSA measurement at the time
point closest to 12 weeks after Enz treatment initiation
(median, 12 weeks; IQR, 10.7-13.6 weeks). A PSA
decline 30% was observed in 17 patients (28%), a PSA
decline 50% was observed in 9 patients (15%), and a
PSA decline 90% was observed in 1 patient (2%). Reasons for Enz treatment discontinuation included no initial

activity in 16 patients (26%), progressive disease in 22
patients (36%), and death in 2 patients (3%). One patient
died of a hemorrhagic stroke, and 1 patient died of disease
progression while receiving Enz treatment. One patient
(2%) was intolerant to Enz and experienced severe nausea
and fatigue (Table 2). At the time of analysis, 19 patients
(31%) were still receiving Enz treatment.
PFS is depicted in the top portion of Figure 2. The
Kaplan-Meier estimate for median PFS was 12.0 weeks
(95% confidence interval [CI], 11.1-16.0 weeks) (Table
2), the estimated median time to PSA progression was
17.4 weeks (95% CI, >16.0 weeks) (Table 2), and the
median OS was 31.6 weeks (95% CI, >28.7 weeks) (Table 2; Fig. 2, bottom). Of the 11 patients (18%) who were
receiving steroid therapy at the time Enz was initiated, 4
(36%) had a maximum PSA response 30%, 2 (18%)
had a maximum PSA response 50%, and 1 (9%) had a
PSA response 90%. The median time to maximum PSA
response was 6.9 weeks (IQR, 3.6-10.5 weeks) in these
patients.
Tolerability

No unexpected toxicity of Enz was reported. Of the 382
adverse events (AEs) collected, the majority (247 AEs;
65%) were grade 1 (Table 2). Grade 2 AEs (n 5 101;
26%) and grade 3 AEs (n 5 34; 9%) were less frequent.
Hot flushes were all grade 1. Fatigue was the most frequent grade 2 and 3 AE and was observed in 60 patients

Relation Between Doc and AA Response and
Response to Enz

Table 3 summarizes characteristics of the patients who
reached a PSA response <50% on Doc or AA treatment,
patients who reached a PSA response 50% on Doc or
AA treatment, and the entire population. The 24 patients
who had a PSA response <50% on Doc treatment
received fewer cycles of Doc and had a lower median best
972

PSA response to Doc treatment compared with the 29
patients who had a PSA response 50% on Doc and compared with the entire population (6 cycles, 10 cycles, and
8 cycles, respectively; 220.1%, 278.3%, and 259.7%,
respectively) (Table 3). The duration of AA treatment was
not different between patients who had a PSA response
<50% on Doc treatment, those who had a PSA response
50% on Doc treatment, and the entire population (26.1
weeks, 21.9 weeks, and 25.9 weeks, respectively).
Although the difference was not statistically significant,
the median maximum response on AA treatment was better in patients who had a PSA response <50% on Doc
treatment compared with the population that had a PSA
response 50% on Doc (227.7% and 29.2%, respectively). Five patients (21%) who had a PSA response
<50% on Doc and 5 patients (18%) who had a PSA
response 50% on Doc had a PSA response 50% on
AA treatment. However, there was no difference in the
maximum PSA response to Enz treatment (median:
228.4%, 222.8%, and 225.2%, respectively) (Table 3)
and the duration of Enz treatment (median: 14.6 weeks,
14.9 weeks, and 14.9 weeks, respectively) between
patients who had a PSA response <50%, those who had a
PSA response 50% on Doc, and the entire population.
The 43 patients who had a PSA response <50% on AA
received AA treatment for a shorter period than patients
who had a PSA response 50% on AA (21.6 weeks and
39.1 weeks, respectively). There was no difference in the
median maximum PSA response to Enz treatment
(231% and 220%, respectively) (Table 3) and the duration of Enz treatment (median: 15 weeks and 17.4 weeks,
respectively) between patients who had a PSA response
<50% and those who had a PSA response 50% on AA
treatment. In linear regression analyses with and without
an interaction term, the best responses on AA and Doc
were not predictive of the response to Enz. By using 30%
and 80% PSA declines as cutoff points, similar correlations between responses to Doc, AA, and Enz were
observed.
DISCUSSION
The response rates to Enz among men with mCRPC who
received previous treatment with Doc and AA and their
survival outcomes suggest modest activity in this cohort of
patients. Forty-six percent of patients had a PSA decline
30% on Enz; however, only 21% had a PSA decline
50%. These PSA response rates are comparable to the
PSA response rates reported in a smaller cohort of 35
mCRPC patients who received Enz after previous AA
treatment.12 The median time to PSA progression on

Patients were stratified according to their maximum PSA response, <50% or 50%, on Doc or AA treatment. The Doc response was not known in 8
patients, and the AA response was not known in 5 patients.
b
This included only the first course of Doc treatment.
c
The maximum PSA response is indicated as the percentage of the baseline value. A negative value reflects a PSA decrease.

Enz, as estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method, was 17.4
weeks, and the median OS was 31.6 weeks. These outcomes compare unfavorably with the outcomes of the
AFFIRM study of Enz in the postdocetaxel setting, in
which 54% of patients reportedly had a PSA response
50%, the median time to PSA progression was 36.1
weeks, and the median OS was 80 weeks. However, this
comparison is hampered by the more advanced disease
stage among patients in the current analysis than among
patients in the AFFIRM study, which is reflected by a
poorer performance score, lower hemoglobin concentration, and a higher PSA levels at baseline.7 A post hoc analysis of the AFFIRM data suggested a worse outcome for
patients who received corticosteroids during Enz treatment.16 Eighteen percent of patients in the current cohort
were receiving corticosteroids; however, the maximum
PSA response and the time to maximum PSA response
did not appear to differ from those in the total population,
although these conclusions are hampered by the small
sample size. Enz treatment was well tolerated in these
extensively pretreated patients with advanced disease, and
no unexpected AEs were reported. Like in the AFFIRM
study, fatigue was the most frequent AE, and all hot
flushes were grade 1.7 However, in contrast, diarrhea was

an infrequent AE in the current study, and musculoskeletal pain was more common than in the AFFIRM study.
Our small retrospective study has several limitations,
including selection bias, variable assessment intervals,
incomplete data on the efficacy and tolerability of Enz,
and a relatively short follow-up.
Recently, Loriot et al and Noonan et al reported
modest response rates and survival outcomes of AA treatment in cohorts of 38 patients and 30 patients, respectively, who progressed on Enz treatment.10,11 In those
studies, PSA response rates 50% were reported in 8%
and 4% of patients, respectively, which was lower than the
21% of patients in the current cohort. However, the median PFS reported by Loriot et al and Noonan et al was in
the same range as the median PFS for the current cohort
(11.7 weeks, 15.4 weeks, and 12.0 weeks, respectively) as
was the reported median OS for the 3 studies (31.3 weeks,
50.1 weeks, and 31.6 weeks, respectively).
Enz inhibits AR signaling by competitively inhibiting the binding of androgens, inhibiting the translocation of ligand-bound receptor to the nucleus, and binding
to its response elements in the DNA.17 In contrast, AA
inhibits CYP17A, which is crucial for testosterone synthesis, with potent suppression of extragonadal androgen

production as a result.18 Although by different means,
both drugs target persistent AR signaling. Despite the differences in patient populations between the AFFIRM
study and the studies into the sequence of AA and Enz,
data from those studies suggest the possibility of crossresistance. However, in the current study, PSA response
on AA treatment did not predict for PSA response on Enz
treatment, which is in line with the nonstatistically significant correlation between PSA response on Enz and PSA
response on AA in the study by Loriot et al.10 However,
Schrader et al suggested a correlation between PSA
response on AA and subsequent Enz treatment in their
cohort of 35 patients.12
There are limited data on the mechanism of resistance
against AA and Enz. Because AA and Enz both target AR
signaling, the mechanism of cross-resistance may be at the
AR level, including AR modifications, complex interactions of AR with coactivators or correpressors, and mutual
regulation of microRNA and AR.19 In xenografts of human
mCRPC that were treated with AA, induction of AR
expression and AR splice variants was demonstrated20,21;
whereas, in another study, AR splice variants were identified as key mediators of persistent AR signaling and resistance to Enz.22 Increased steroidogenesis activation also
may mediate cross-resistance between AA and Enz.19 Testosterone levels in blood and bone marrow from patients
who received AA treatment were undetectable on treatment
discontinuation23; however, Enz treatment increased testosterone levels in the bone marrow of patients and
decreased nuclear AR expression.24 In a mouse model of
human prostate cancer, the oncogenic AKt pathway was
activated when the AR was inhibited.25 This reciprocal activation of oncogenic pathways upon AR inhibition may represent a mechanism of resistance to AR antagonists.19
Combination treatment of Enz and AA may reverse
some mechanisms of drug resistance. A study in human
prostate cancer cell lines provided evidence that the glucocorticoid drugs administered with AA to prevent side
effects and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists could
activate mutant AR, which was inhibited by Enz.26 These
findings provide a rationale for combination treatment.
Currently, a phase 2 trial into the safety and tolerability of
Enz in combination with AA is enrolling (National Clinical Trials identifier NCT01650194).
In conclusion, patients in the current study who previously progressed on AA had a modest PSA response rate
and limited survival on subsequent Enz treatment. PSA
response on AA treatment did not seem to predict for Enz
treatment outcome. PFS and OS were in the same range
as those described in 2 cohorts of men with mCRPC who
974

received AA after progressing on Enz. Data from these 3
studies suggest limited activity and no preference for either sequence of treatments. However, a recommendation
on the sequencing of Enz and AA in the postdocetaxel setting cannot be made, because these data are only hypothesis generating. Further studies are needed to establish the
sequence of treatments with these new drugs.
