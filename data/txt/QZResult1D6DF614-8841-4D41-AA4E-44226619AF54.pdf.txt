Abstract
Studies have conjectured that nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory
drugs (NSAID) inhibit growth of various malignancies by
inhibiting cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) enzyme activity. Yet,
several lines of evidence indicate that a COX-2–independent
mechanism may also be involved in their antitumor effects.
Here, we report that NSAIDs may inhibit the growth of
glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) cells through COX-2–
independent mechanisms, including up-regulation of both
15-hydroxyprostaglandin dehydrogenase (15-PGDH, the key
prostaglandin catabolic enzyme) and the cell cycle inhibitor
p21. Using Western blot and real-time PCR analysis in
various GBM cell lines, we observed up-regulation of 15PGDH and p21 after NSAIDs treatment. To elucidate the role
of 15-PGDH in GBM, transfection assays were conducted
using the T98G GBM cell line. Overexpression of 15-PGDH
suppressed cell growth and was associated with increased
expression of p21. In an attempt to investigate the roles of
COX-2, 15-PGDH, and p21 in the inhibition of growth of
GBM, small interfering RNA (siRNA) against each of these
proteins was transfected into T98G cells. Inhibition of
growth mediated by NSAIDs was partially reversed after
knockdown of either 15-PGDH or p21, but not after COX-2
knockdown. Moreover, expression level of p21 was not
affected in COX-2 siRNA transfected cells. Our studies
provide evidence that the up-regulation of 15-PGDH induced
by NSAIDs has the potential to inhibit growth of GBM, in
part, by up-regulation of p21 possibly independent from
COX-2 enzymatic function. [Cancer Res 2008;68(17):6978–86]

Introduction
Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAID) have been used to
treat inflammatory diseases, such as arthritis, because of their
potent relief of pain and inflammation. Accumulating epidemiologic studies suggest that use of NSAIDs is associated with a
reduced risk of colorectal cancer, as well as other malignancies
(1–12). In general, this antitumor activity of NSAIDs is believed to
be mediated via inhibition of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) enzymatic
activity in a manner similar to its antiinflammatory effect (13).
15-Hydroxyprostaglandin dehydrogenase (15-PGDH) catalyzes
the oxidation of the 15(S)-hydroxyl group of prostaglandins

resulting in the production of 15-keto-prostaglandins and 15keto-lipoxins, which have greatly reduced biological activities (14).
Therefore, this protein has been considered a key enzyme involved
in biological inactivation of prostaglandins. COX-2 promotes
prostaglandin synthesis, whereas 15-PGDH behaves as an antagonist of COX-2. Recent reports suggest that 15-PGDH has activities
similar to a tumor suppressor gene in cancers of the lung (15),
gastrointestinal tract (16), and breast (17). The role of 15-PGDH in
glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) and its ability to inhibit growth of
GBM cells have not been elucidated yet.
GBM is one of the most common tumors of the central nervous
system. Despite many efforts to overcome this aggressive disease
with the use of surgery, radiation, and conventional chemotherapy,
the median survival for patients with GBM is only 1 year (18).
Whereas the molecular events involved in the development of GBM
are not fully understood, studies have led to the recognition of the
importance of COX-2. Its expression has been detected in brain
tumors (19, 20), and high COX-2 expression in gliomas is associated
with a poor prognosis (21). Recently, several phase I and phase II
trials investigated the addition of NSAIDs to standard therapeutic
modalities in GBM and found the combinations to be safe and
active (22–24). The mechanisms involved in NSAID-induced growth
inhibition in GBM are not fully elucidated. For example, growth
inhibitory activity of the COX inhibitor indomethacin was observed
in COX-deficient GBM cells (25), and COX-2 inhibition was found to
be neither necessary nor sufficient for the growth inhibitory
activity of the COX-2 inhibitor celecoxib in GBM cells (26). In this
study, we investigated the growth inhibitory activity of NSAIDs on
GBM cells and found it to be partially COX-2–independent. We
identified up-regulation of 15-PGDH and p21 as important
mechanisms involved in these COX-2–independent activities of
NSAIDs. Furthermore, our studies found, for the first time, that
15-PGDH was able to inhibit growth of GBM cells.

Materials and Methods
Cells and compounds. T98G, U118, U343, and U373 cells (American
Type Culture Collection) were maintained at 37jC in 5% CO2 in DMEM
(Invitrogen) with 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen). Diclofenac sodium
and meloxicam sodium (Sigma Chemical Co.) were dissolved in sterile
water and DMSO (Sigma Chemical Co.), respectively. CAY10397 (Cayman
Chemical Co.), a 15-PGDH specific inhibitor, was dissolved in DMSO. Final
concentration of DMSO in the experiments was never above 0.5%, and
control dishes having the same concentration of DMSO had no detectable
effect.
Western blotting. Total cell lysates were extracted using radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer [1% Triton  100, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1%
SDS, 50 mmol/L Tris-HCl (pH 7.4)] containing a mixture of protease
inhibitors (Roche Diagnostics GmbH). The mixture was run through a
needle to shear the DNA and then centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 20 min at
4jC. Protein concentrations were determined using the Bio-Rad protein

assay dye reagent (Bio-Rad Laboratories), according to the manufacturer’s
instruction. Western blotting was done, as previously described (17). Briefly,
f50 Ag of total protein extracts were denatured in sample buffer by boiling
for 5 min and then subjected to 4% to 15% SDS-PAGE followed by
electrotransfer to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The blots were
probed with chemiluminescence Western blotting detection reagents
(Pierce). The following primary antibodies were used: anti-p21, anti–cyclin
D1, anti–COX-2 from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, and anti–glyceraldehyde3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) from Fitzgerald Industries. AntiPGDH antibodies were described previously (16).
Real-time reverse transcription–PCR. Total cellular RNAs were
isolated from cells using RNeasy minikit (Qiagen), and cDNAs were
synthesized using Superscript III reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen)
according to the manufacturer’s instruction. Expression levels were
determined using Platinum Taq DNA polymerase (Invitrogen) and
SYBERGreen I (Molecular Probes) with the following primers: PGDH

95jC followed by 50 cycles of 95jC for 20 s, 60jC for 20 s, 72jC for 20 s, and
84jC for 20 s. For each sample, the amount of the target gene was divided
by the reference gene (h-actin).

Small interfering RNA. For design of small interfering RNA (siRNA)
oligos targeting PGDH, a DNA sequence of type AA (N19), was selected to
correspond with the nucleotides 444-462 located 3¶ to the first nucleotide of
the start codon of the human 15-PGDH cDNA (BC018986). BLAST search
against the human genome sequence showed that only the 15-PGDH gene
was targeted. Both of the siRNAs against COX-2 and p21, and control siRNA
were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology.
Transfections. T98G cells were plated onto six-well plates at 2  105
per well. After 24 h, cells were transfected with 8 Ag of pcDNA3 plasmid
using LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. The transfected cells were selected with 50 Ag/mL G418
(Omega Scientific). Two stable clones (P5, P6) expressing PGDH and four
empty vector clones (E1–E4) of T98G GBM cells were expanded and used
for the following studies. For the transfection of siRNA against COX-2
and 15-PGDH, as well as control siRNA, the siRNAs were transfected
using OligofectAMINE (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. Briefly, OligofectAMINE was incubated with serum-free
medium for 10 min. Subsequently, a mixture of siRNA was added. After
incubation for 20 min at room temperature, the mixture was diluted
with medium and added to each well. Thirty-six hours later, cells were
harvested.
Cell cycle assays. After treatment with the indicated compounds, the
cells were harvested, fixed in methanol, and stained with propidium iodide
(Abcam). Flow cytometry was done at the Flow Cytometry Core facility of
Sackler Faculty of Medicine, Tel-Aviv University.
Statistical analysis. The data are expressed as the means F SD. The

Results
Inhibition of glioma cell proliferation by NSAIDs. The effect
of two different NSAIDs, diclofenac sodium and meloxicam
sodium, on the proliferation of three GBM cell lines, T98G, U118,
and U373, was studied by cell counts. The cells were treated with
100 Amol/L of diclofenac or 10 Amol/L of meloxicam, and the effect
on proliferation was determined after 48 hours of culture. Both
drugs suppressed the proliferation of the three GBM cell lines
(Fig. 1A). Diclofenac had a more potent inhibitory effect than
meloxicam on all of the glioma cells in these conditions.
Cell cycle analysis using propidium iodide at 24 hours after
treatment with diclofenac (100 Amol/L) revealed a significant
increase in the percentage of sub-G0 apoptotic cells after treatment
(Fig. 1B).
Up-regulation of 15-PGDH and p21 expression in glioma
cells after treatment with NSAIDs. The effects of NSAIDs on the
expression of 15-PGDH protein were tested using Western blotting.
Three GBM cell lines were examined either with or without NSAIDs
(Fig. 2A). Expression of 15-PGDH protein was increased by
treatment with the NSAIDs in all GBM cell lines. p21 and cyclin

D1 protein expression was also examined in these cells (Fig. 2B).
Cyclin D1 levels were significantly reduced by diclofenac in all cell
lines, whereas meloxicam treatment reduced cyclin D1 levels in
T98G and U118 cells, but not in U373 cells. The p21 levels were
significantly up-regulated by both drugs in T98G cells and by
meloxicam in U373 cells. As previously reported (27), U118 cells
expressed high basal levels of p21 and therefore did not show p21
up-regulation after treatment. The level of mRNA expression of 15PGDH and p21 after treatment was also determined by real-time
reverse transcription–PCR (RT-PCR) in T98G cells (Fig. 2C and D).
Levels of both transcripts were increased by the NSAIDs in parallel
with the increase of their proteins. The level of cyclin D1 mRNA did
not change (data not shown).
Inhibition of growth of GBM cells with forced expression of
15-PGDH. To elucidate the role of overexpression of 15-PGDH in
glioma cells, T98G cells were stably transfected with a 15-PGDH
expression vector. Two clones (P5 and P6) were established, which
stably expressed 15-PGDH, and four clones containing empty
vector were also isolated (Fig. 3A). Cell proliferation assays showed
that the 15-PGDH clones (P5 and P6) grew 50% slower than the
wild-type and empty-vector transfected clones (E1–E4) at 48 hours
(P < 0.05; Fig. 3B). When NSAIDs were added, cell proliferation of
the P5 and P6 clones (GBM overexpressing 15-PGDH) was

suppressed significantly compared with the GBM clone containing
the empty vector (E1; Fig. 3C).
Increased expression of p21 protein in GBM cells overexpressing 15-PGDH. As shown in Fig. 2A–C, p21 expression was
up-regulated together with 15-PGDH when T98G cells were treated
with NSAIDs. Therefore, we studied whether 15-PGDH overexpressing cells (clones P5 and P6) had increased expression of
p21. By Western blotting, strong expression of the p21 protein was
observed in these cells, whereas the empty vector containing E1
clone had negligible levels. Cyclin D1 protein was reduced in
15-PGDH overexpressing cells (Fig. 3D).
Down-regulation of COX-2 does not alter either 15-PGDH or
p21 expression and does not affect proliferation in GBM cells.
COX-2 is one of the key enzymes that regulates prostaglandin
production and can modulate cancer cell growth. To examine the
contribution of COX-2 to glioma cell growth, we knocked-down
specifically COX-2. A siRNA against COX-2 and a control siRNA

were transfected into T98G cells, resulting in a marked decrease of
COX-2 protein (Fig. 4A), but no significant alteration occurred in
either levels of 15-PGDH, p21, or cyclin D1 proteins or p21 mRNA
expression (Fig. 4A and B, respectively). The cells transfected with
an siRNA against COX-2 did not show a significant difference in
proliferation compared with the control siRNA transfected cells
(Fig. 4C, left). When either diclofenac or meloxicam was added to
the culture medium, the cells transfected with COX-2 siRNA did not
change their growth rate compared with the control siRNA
transfected cells (Fig. 4C, middle and right).
Down-regulation or inhibition of 15-PGDH restores growth

and a control siRNA were transfected into T98G cells. Analyses of
15-PGDH mRNA levels revealed that siRNA against 15-PGDH
effectively reduced expression of the gene (Fig. 5A, left). p21 mRNA
levels were also down-regulated in the cells transfected with the

increased expression of cyclin D1 protein in these15-PGDH
silenced cells (Fig. 5A, right). Cell proliferation assays showed that
the cells transfected with siRNA against 15-PGDH had no change in
proliferation compared with the cells transfected with control
siRNA (Fig. 5B, left top). In contrast, when either diclofenac or
meloxicam was added to the cultures, the cells transfected with 15PGDH siRNA grew significantly faster than the cells with control
siRNA (Fig. 5B, middle and right top). Moreover, in the 15-PGDH–
deficient cells, 15-PGDH mRNA levels were suppressed and almost
unchanged and p21 mRNA levels increased only mildly after the
addition of NSAIDs (Fig. 5B, bottom).
To validate the role of 15-PGDH in the growth inhibitory effects
of NSAIDs, 15-PGDH activity was inhibited by CAY10397, a specific
inhibitor of 15-PGDH. Cell proliferation assay showed that the cells
treated with 20 Amol/L of CAY10397 had no change in proliferation
compared with untreated cells (Fig. 5C, left top). In contrast, when
either diclofenac or meloxicam was added to the cultures, the cells
with CAY10397 grew significantly (P < 0.05) faster than those
cultured with either diclofenac or meloxicam alone (Fig. 5C, middle
and right top). In parallel, CAY10397 reduced expression of p21
mRNA in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 5C, bottom). Taken

together, these data suggest that 15-PGDH expression and activity
is necessary for the growth inhibitory effects of NSAIDs in these
cells.
Down-regulation of p21 also restores growth inhibition of
glioma cells by NSAIDs. An siRNA against p21 was also transfected
into T98G cells. Analyses of p21 mRNA levels revealed that siRNA
against p21 effectively reduced expression of the gene (Fig. 6A) and
increased expression of cyclin D1 (Fig. 6B). Cell proliferation assays
showed that the cells transfected with siRNA against p21 had no
change in proliferation compared with the cells transfected with
control siRNA (Fig. 6C, left). In contrast, when either diclofenac or
meloxicam was added to the cultures, the cells transfected with
p21 siRNA grew significantly (P < 0.05) faster compared with the
cells with control siRNA (Fig. 6C, middle and right).
Snail expression in NSAID-treated glioma cells. A recent
report showed that Snail, a transcription factor, repressed
expression of 15-PGDH in colon cancer cells (28). To investigate
whether Snail expression plays a role in the regulation of 15-PGDH
in NSAID-treated glioma cells, mRNA levels of Snail was measured
by real-time RT-PCR. No difference in Snail expression was noted
between NSAID-treated and untreated cells (data not shown).

Discussion
Beginning in the1980s, studies reported that treatment with
NSAIDs were associated with a reduced risk for colon cancer (29,
30). Since then, many more studies have confirmed that NSAIDs
can reduce the risk of various types of cancers (9–14). Traditional
NSAIDs are nonselective inhibitors of COX-1 and COX-2. Studies
suggest that reduction of carcinogenesis by NSAIDs results from
inhibition of the activity of COX-2. The premise that COX-2
inhibition is essential for this antitumor effect is based on the
observation that prostaglandin E2 and other COX-2 generated
downstream mediators promote tumor cell proliferation (31, 32),
survival (33–36), and angiogenesis (37, 38) in an autocrine and/or
paracrine manner. Recently, however, several lines of evidence
indicate that a COX-2–independent mechanism may be involved in
the antitumor activity of COX-2 inhibitors. For example, several
COX-2 inhibitors have similar abilities to inhibit COX-2 activity but
differ considerably in their potency to induce apoptosis of cancer
cells (39). Also, metabolites of sulindac (an NSAID) induce
apoptosis of prostate cancer cells despite their inability to inhibit
COX-2 activity (40). Moreover, overexpression of COX-2 in
immortalized human umbilical vein endothelial HEK-293, COS-7,
and NIH3T3 cells led to their increased cell death and/or cell cycle

cells and PC-12 pheochromocytoma cells inhibited their apoptosis

(43–45). Also, an NSAID caused cell cycle arrest of ovarian cancer
cells independently of COX-2 inhibition (46). Likewise, celecoxib
inhibited growth of prostate cancer cells by the inhibition of
3-phosphoinositide–dependent protein kinase-1/Akt signaling
pathway (47). Therefore, tissue specificity may explain these
differences in responses and mechanisms of action of NSAIDs.
COX-2 may not always be the major target of NSAIDs and may not
necessarily be responsible for the antitumor activity in some types
of cancer cells.
In this study, we observed, for the first time, up-regulation of
15-PGDH after treatment of GBM cells with NSAIDs. In addition,
15-PGDH overexpressing T98G cells had a further reduction of
growth in the presence of NSAIDs compared with the cells
transfected with an empty vector (Fig. 3C). When 15-PGDH was
silenced by siRNA or inhibited by a specific inhibitor, growth of
T98G cells was restored with exposure to NSAIDs (Fig. 5). These
results suggest that 15-PGDH may interact with another target
molecule of NSAIDs. In contrast, knockdown of COX-2 expression
did not show any alteration in growth of T98G cells either in the
presence or absence of an NSAID (Fig. 4C).
Exposure to NSAIDs was accompanied by an up-regulation of
the cyclin-dependent kinase (cdk) inhibitor, p21 in T98G and
U373 cells, which express low basal levels of p21 (27). In T98G
cells, both mRNA and protein levels were increased after

NSAIDs Inhibit Glioma Cell Growth via 15-PGDH

treatment. Also, levels of p21 protein markedly increased with
forced expression of 15-PGDH (Fig. 3D). Consistently, cyclin D1
protein decreased in NSAID-exposed cells and 15-PGDH–overexpressing cells (Figs. 2B and 3D), which may be explained by
degradation of cyclin D1–cdk4 complex. In contrast, knockdown
of COX-2 gene expression had no effect on p21 levels (Fig. 4A).
This observation is consistent with a previous report in which the
growth inhibition of the COX-2 inhibitors and their ability to
induce p21 were not affected by COX-2 siRNA in lung cancer cell
lines (48). Treatment with aspirin and indomethacin has been
reported to induce apoptosis in T98G cells (49). Similarly, we
noted increased levels of apoptosis after diclofenac treatment in
all three GBM cells that were tested.
We observed tumor suppressor-like activities for 15-PGDH in
glioma cells. Others have reported that 15-PGDH behaves as a
tumor suppressor gene in lung (17), colon (18), and breast cancers
(19). Our study showed that ectopic overexpression of 15-PGDH
inhibited growth of the T98G glioma cells, and inhibition of
expression of this enzyme blunted the antiproliferative activity of
the NSAIDs.
Recently, Mann and colleagues reported that expression of
15-PGDH was repressed by epidermal growth factor (EGF) and
Snail in colon cancer cells (28). The study suggested that signaling
through the EGF receptor induced Snail which bound to the
15-PGDH promoter and repressed transcription of 15-PGDH. The
report raised a question whether the alterations associated with

15-PGDH by NSAIDs might also involve Snail expression. We found
no change in Snail expression in glioma cells either with or without
treatment with NSAIDs.
In conclusion, this study identified 15-PGDH as a pivotal
regulator of glioma cell growth. Forced expression of 15-PGDH in
glioma cells slowed their growth and, blocking its expression,
prevented the growth inhibition mediated by NSAID. The observed
regulation of growth may be mediated in part by regulating levels
of p21. The results suggest that 15-PGDH can behave as a tumor
suppressor in glioma cells and should be considered as a target for
therapeutic manipulation.
