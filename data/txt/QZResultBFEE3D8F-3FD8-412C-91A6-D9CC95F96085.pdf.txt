ABSTRACT
While results thus far demonstrate the clinical benefit of trastuzumab,
some patients do not respond to this therapy. To identify a molecular predictor
of trastuzumab benefit, we conducted whole-transcriptome analysis of primary
HER2+ breast carcinomas obtained from patients treated with trastuzumab-containing
therapies and correlated the molecular portrait with treatment benefit.
The estimated association between gene expression and relapse-free survival
allowed development of a trastuzumab risk model (TRAR), with ERBB2 and ESR1
expression as core elements, able to identify patients with high and low risk of
relapse. Application of the TRAR model to 24 HER2+ core biopsies from patients
treated with neo-adjuvant trastuzumab indicated that it is predictive of trastuzumab
response. Examination of TRAR in available whole-transcriptome datasets indicated
that this model stratifies patients according to response to trastuzumab-based
neo-adjuvant treatment but not to chemotherapy alone. Pathway analysis revealed
that TRAR-low tumors expressed genes of the immune response, with higher
numbers of CD8-positive cells detected immunohistochemically compared to TRARhigh tumors.
The TRAR model identifies tumors that benefit from trastuzumab-based treatment
as those most enriched in CD8-positive immune infiltrating cells and with high ERBB2
and low ESR1 mRNA levels, indicating the requirement for both features in achieving
trastuzumab response.

INTRODUCTION

associated with HER2 (ERBB2, GRB7, ORMDL3) or
ER (C1orf186, ESR1, RERG). ERBB2-related genes were
more highly expressed in low-risk than in high-risk patients,
whereas the opposite was found for ESR1-associated genes
(Figure 2A).
Based on the apparent relevance of ERBB2 and
ESR1 mRNA levels in discriminating patients with low or
high risk of relapse, we applied to our dataset the PAM50
subtype predictor, which identifies the HER2-enriched
(HER2E) subtype as the tumor group most responsive
to trastuzumab [5]. Kaplan-Meier analysis confirmed
that patients with HER2E tumors had the best survival
outcome after adjuvant trastuzumab therapy compared to
all other collective subtypes in our cohort ( p = 0.0020,
Figure S1). PAM50 classification was significantly
associated with TRAR ( p <0.0001), with all HER2E
tumors classified as TRAR-low (Figure 2A) but not
all TRAR-low classified as HER2E. Kaplan-Meier
analysis stratifying TRAR-low tumors into HER2E and
non-HER2E indicated that both had similar recurrence
probability and a significantly lower recurrence probability
than TRAR-high tumors (TRAR-low/non-HER2E
vs TRAR-high: p = 0.0312, TRAR-low/HER2E vs
TRAR-high: p = 0.0003, Figure 2C).
To test whether the TRAR model identifies patients
with intrinsic poor prognosis independent of trastuzumab
treatment, we analyzed 132 HER2+ BCs treated with
adjuvant chemotherapy alone from the Metabric dataset. We
found only borderline statistical significance toward better
prognosis for TRAR-high versus TRAR-low tumors (HR =
0.64; 95% CI: 0.38–1.08, p = 0.0986; Figure S2), suggesting
that TRAR-low tumors have a bad prognosis if treated with
chemotherapy alone and thus that the model is specific for
the benefit from trastuzumab treatment. Notably, analysis
of TRAR-low partitioned according to PAM50 indicated
similar recurrence rates for both HER2E and non-HER2E
tumors when treated with chemotherapy alone (Figure S2).

Trastuzumab is the standard-of-care treatment for
patients with HER2+ breast cancer (BC), reducing the
risk of relapse and death in patients when administered
with chemotherapy [1]. Even so, some patients do not
benefit from this reagent and disease recurs [2, 3]. Thus,
HER2 expression as determined by immunohistochemistry
or fluorescence in situ hybridization is insufficient for
selection of patients likely to benefit from this therapy,
indicating the need to identify a biomarker(s) able to
recognize such patients. Retrospective analyses from major
studies of trastuzumab treatment have suggested that tumor
dependence on HER2 or immune infiltrate might serve as
predictive biomarkers. Two studies that used expression
profiling of selected genes in archived formalin-fixed,
paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tumor blocks support the
significance of ERBB2 mRNA expression in predicting
trastuzumab benefit [4, 5], and evidence for the predictive
value of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes is emerging [6, 7].
To determine whether whole-transcriptome
analysis of HER2+ primary BCs might improve the
search for molecular features predictive of trastuzumab
benefit, we conducted gene expression profiling of
archived FFPE tumor blocks from HER2+ BCs. A model
constructed based on genes strictly associated with
relapse-free survival (RFS) identified two subgroups of
HER2+ BC with distinct biological characteristics that
benefit differently from trastuzumab-based therapy both
in adjuvant and neo-adjuvant settings. Responsive tumors
were enriched both in HER2 dependent signals and in
immune cell infiltration.

RESULTS
Construction of a model for risk of relapse
To test whether whole-transcriptome expression
profiling of HER2+ BCs can identify a biomarker indicating
benefit from adjuvant trastuzumab, we analyzed the
gene expression profile of 53 tumors and developed the
TRAstuzumab Risk (TRAR) prediction model (Figure 1).
Using a semi-supervised principal component method,
we identified patients with high and low risk of relapse
(Figure 2A). Based on a threshold defined by a 10-fold
cross-validation method [8], samples were grouped
as high (n = 27) or low (n = 26) risk of early relapse, as
confirmed by survival analysis revealing an 8-fold higher risk
of relapse in the high- versus low-risk group in this selected
cohort (HR = 8.0, 95% CI = 3.5–18.2, p = 0.0001). The model
had a good performance (Figure 2B) and the classification
was independent of clinico-pathological characteristics
(Figure 2A). Among the 41 genes of the model (listed in
Table S1), 9 that persisted in the model during permutation
tests to define the relative weight of each gene represented
a core element of TRAR. Six of these genes were

Predictive power of the TRAR model
To test the predictive performance of the TRAR
classifier in identifying BCs that respond to neo-adjuvant
trastuzumab, we analyzed the gene expression profile of
24 core biopsies obtained from tumors retrieved from the
TRUP window-of-opportunity trial [9] before any treatment.
Application of TRAR to this dataset showed that patients
achieving a complete response (pCR) to trastuzumab-based
chemotherapy had significantly lower predictive indices
than those with residual disease (Figure 3A). The classifier
also showed good performance in identifying patients
experiencing a response (AUC = 0.85, 95% CI: 0.69–1.00,
p = 0.0133, Figure 3B) when the cut-off obtained in the
GHEA cohort was applied, with all pCR found in the TRARlow group ( p = 0.0137, Figure 3C). Also in this cohort of
patients, TRAR correlated with PAM50 classification
(Figure 3C) and identified the 2 pathological complete

responses with perfect accuracy among non-HER2E tumors
( p = 0.0273).
Note that patients whose tumors responded to one
cycle of trastuzumab alone (i.e., a reduction in tumor
volume) showed a borderline statistical significance toward
lower predictive indices ( p = 0.0838) than those whose
tumors progressed upon trastuzumab treatment (Figure 3D).
To validate the predictive performance of the classifier
in identifying BCs that respond to neo-adjuvant trastuzumab,
we applied TRAR to the only two available public datasets,
GSE22358 and GSE50948. In this analysis, patients
achieving a complete response to trastuzumab-based
chemotherapy showed significantly lower predictive indices
than those with residual disease ( p = 0.0057 and p = 0.0126,
respectively; Figure S3). In both datasets, the classifier
showed good performance in identifying patients whose
tumors responded (GSE22358: AUC = 0.81, 95%
CI: 0.63–0.99, p = 0.0057; GSE50948: AUC = 0.66, 95%
CI: 0.53–0.78, p = 0.0180; Figure S3). Again, the TRAR and
PAM50 classifications were associated, with a significantly
lower expression of the TRAR predictive indices in HER2E
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

than non-HER2E tumors (Figure S3). Moreover, TRAR also
showed fair ability (even if not statistically significant) in
identifying responsive tumors classified as non-HER2E by
PAM50 in these two datasets (GSE22358: AUC = 0.73, 95%
CI: 0.34–1.00, p = 0.1918; GSE50948: AUC = 0.71, 95%
CI: 0.49–0.93, p = 0.0591). In contrast, the TRAR predictive
indices of HER2+ BCs that respond or do not respond to
neo-adjuvant chemotherapy alone did not differ significantly
in the GSE50948 and GSE41656 datasets (Figure S3).
Comparison of the predictive performance of TRAR in the
chemotherapy and trastuzumab arms of GSE50948 dataset
showed that TRAR had a significantly higher performance
in predicting response in the trastuzumab arm ( p = 0.0363),
indicating that our model exhibits a different predictive value
according to the addition of trastuzumab to chemotherapy.

Biological features of tumors according to TRAR
and PAM50 classification
Exploiting the whole-transcriptome profile of the
GHEA cohort, we investigated the biological features

of TRAR-low and -high tumors. Enrichment analysis
according to the TRAR model identified several gene sets
differentially and significantly enriched in the TRAR-low
subgroup characterized by overexpression of immune
system-related genes and proliferation-associated pathways
(Figure 4A and Table S2). Further examination of immune
infiltration subtypes using immune metagenes [10] in
the GHEA cohort showed that compared to TRAR-high
tumors, TRAR-low tumors expressed significantly higher
levels of lymphocyte-specific kinase (LCK) metagene, a
surrogate marker of T cells, and STAT1 and interferon (IFN)
metagenes, associated with IFN signal transduction (Figure
4B). Pathological assessment of immune infiltrating cells in
tumors by examining FFPE slides indicated no differences
in their total amount according to TRAR classification, and
immunohistochemical characterization of leukocytes and
B lymphocytes revealed similar percentages of CD45+
and CD20+ cells in the two groups (Table 1). No or only very
low numbers (<5 cells) of NK cells were found in tumors
independent of TRAR classification (data not shown). In
contrast, TRAR-low tumors showed significantly higher T

cell infiltration ( p = 0.0084) and CD8+ T cell numbers than
did TRAR-high tumors (Table 1 and Figure S4).

DISCUSSION
Our analyses of tumors derived from patients treated
in routine clinical practice identify a new molecular
classifier, TRAR, predictive of adjuvant trastuzumab benefit
based on the expression levels of 41 genes associated with
early relapse. Unlike previous works [4, 7], we did not base
our gene selection on an empirical or biological approach,
but instead applied a pre-developed semi-supervised learning
method [11] to our dataset. The ability of our classifier to
specifically identify tumors with low or high risk of relapse
upon trastuzumab-containing therapy, but not chemotherapy
alone, indicates that the molecular characteristics detected
are specific in predicting benefit from HER2-targeted
therapies rather than benefit from chemotherapy or due to
low aggressiveness of the tumor. TRAR also showed good
performance in predicting the response to trastuzumab
neo-adjuvant treatment, consistent with the notion that the

molecular features detected by this model are indicative of
anti-tumor trastuzumab activity.
Our analyses point to the relevance of simultaneous
high ERBB2 and low ESR1 expression in dictating
trastuzumab efficacy, as demonstrated by the association of
these characteristics with TRAR-low cases. Thus, among
~20, 000 genes analyzed for expression levels, mRNA
levels of ERBB2- and ESR1-related genes emerge as those
crucial in mirroring tumor susceptibility to anti-HER2
therapy. In this context, the association of the TRAR-low
tumor subset with the HER2E intrinsic profile further
supports the notion that tumors with the highest activation
of HER2 signal are those most sensitive to trastuzumab.
Additionally, our analysis revealed the existence of a
TRAR-low subset of tumors not strictly dependent on
HER2 signals (non-HER2E) that takes advantage of
trastuzumab-containing treatment, suggesting that TRAR
predicts trastuzumab benefit better than does PAM50.

TRAR-high tumors might instead grow through signals
derived from other receptors (e.g., ER, IGFR), with
consequent low benefit from anti-HER2 therapy. The
observation that low expression of ESR1 is associated
with good benefit from trastuzumab is consistent with
several lines of evidence suggesting that ER signaling is a
mediator of trastuzumab resistance [12].
The whole-transcriptome approach also indicated
that TRAR-low tumors are enriched in expression of
immune-associated pathways, pointing to the existence
in the same tumors of both HER2 dependency and
immune infiltration and suggesting a possible direct
relationship between the two features that would explain
the ability of either feature to predict disease outcome
in trastuzumab-treated patients. In this context, we found
that tumors of patients who benefit from trastuzumab
have significantly higher CD8+ T cells in their
microenvironment, pointing for the first time in clinical

samples to the relevance of these cells for trastuzumab
activity, so far described only in preclinical models
[13, 14]. These data, rather than supporting the exploration
of the predictive performance of CD8+ cells in identifying
patients who will benefit from trastuzumab, suggest that
trastuzumab may elicit the anti-tumor activity of immune
cells infiltrating TRAR-low tumors, in agreement with
observations in tumors of other histotypes treated with
inhibitors of their driver oncogenes [15].
From a clinical perspective, it is critical to
understand whether trastuzumab alone is sufficient to
activate the pre-existing immune microenvironment

www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

favorable to its activity in TRAR-low patients, or whether
the addition of chemotherapy, reported to induce immune
system activation [16], is necessary to generate this
response. The response of TRAR-low tumors to one cycle
of trastuzumab alone in the TRUP cohort suggests that the
immune microenvironment of such BCs could support
trastuzumab anti-tumor activity without chemotherapy
addition.
Although further studies in an independent large
cohort of patients treated with trastuzumab-containing
therapy are needed to corroborate these findings, our
results revealed that the therapeutic effects of trastuzumab

Immunohistochemistry
HER2, Ki67 and ER positivity were re-evaluated
by HercepTest, antibody clone MIB-1 and antibody clone
EP1 (all from Dako, Hamburg, Germany), respectively,
on histological sections consecutive to those used for
gene expression profiling. HER2 positivity was defined as
3+ overexpression in more than 10% of tumor cells by
immunohistochemical (IHC) testing or 2+ overexpression
and HER2 amplification ratio of at least 2.2 by
fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). Tumors were
considered Ki67- and ER-positive if at least 14% and 10%
of cells showed immunoreactivity, respectively.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study design and patient cohorts
The 53 tumors profiled, with a median follow-up of
22 months, were obtained from BC patients treated with
adjuvant chemotherapy plus trastuzumab between 2005
and 2009, deriving from our recent multicenter Italian
observational study GHEA [17]. All patients received
chemotherapy and trastuzumab at 3-week intervals for a
median period of 1 year; hormone therapy was used in
53% of patients (Table S3). Relapsed samples (n = 23)
were matched 1:1 (16 tumors) and 1:2 (7 tumors) with
non-relapsed tumors (n = 30) for patient age, estrogen
receptor positivity (ER), lymph node involvement and
tumor size. All selected samples contained at least 70%
tumor cells.
Twenty-four tumors of the trastuzumab-upfront
in HER2 positive locally advanced breast cancer
(TRUP) cohort were obtained from patients with locally
advanced primary BC diagnosed using incisional biopsy
and deriving from our recent prospective neo-adjuvant
study [9]. Patients were treated with one cycle of
trastuzumab alone followed by 4 cycles of chemotherapy
and trastuzumab (Table S4). All procedures were in
accordance with the Helsinki Declaration. Biospecimens
used for research consisted of leftover material of
samples collected during standard surgical and medical
approaches at Fondazione IRCCS Istituto Nazionale dei
Tumori of Milan and Istituti Ospitalieri di Cremona.
Samples were donated by patients to the Institutional
BioBanks for research purposes, and aliquots were
allocated to this study after approval by the Institutional

Immune cell infiltration evaluation
Pathological assessment of stromal lymphocytic
infiltration was carried out as described [18].
Infiltration of total leukocytes, T, B, CD8+ T cells
and NK cells was analyzed immunohistochemically on
FFPE tumor sections using the Automated Immunostainer.
The following antibodies were used: mouse anti-human
CD45 (1:200, Dako), rabbit anti-human CD3
(1:400, Dako), mouse anti-human CD20 (1:400, Dako),
mouse anti-human CD8 (1:200, Dako), and mouse
anti-human CD56 (1:400, NeoMarkers, Fremont, CA),
respectively. Antigen retrieval was carried out using the
Target Retrieval Solution pH9 (Dako). Immunoreactions
were visualized using streptavidin-biotin-peroxidase,
followed by counterstaining with Carazzi hematoxylin.
Stained slides were digitized by a slide scanner
(ImageScope XT, Aperio), and the virtual slides were
subsequently evaluated using the ‘positive pixel count’
algorithm of  Aperio ImageScope. The percentage of
positive stromal cells was calculated as the number
of positive pixels/μm2. Data were divided into two groups
(positive and negative) using median value as cut-off.

regression coefficients of the two principal components
fitted by the Cox proportional hazards model in 10-fold
cross-validation. Samples were classified as high- or
low-risk by a 10-fold cross-validation approach: based
on the median index values obtained in the training set
comprising 90% of the cases, the remaining 10% of
omitted test cases were classified. After reiteration of the
entire procedure, omitting a different 10% of cases until
each case was omitted once, all cases were stratified.
Analysis and plotting were conducted using R package
superpc (http://www-stat.stanford.edu/~tibs/superpc).
Prediction accuracy was evaluated through
time-dependent ROC curves at maximum time points
of follow-up using the SurvJamda R package [23].
ROC curve assessment for censored survival data was
performed using the non-parametric estimator based on
nearest neighbor bivariate distribution [24]. Accuracy of
the prediction was plotted after 10-fold cross-validation
and reported as mean and standard deviation.
Validation of the TRAR model was carried out as
described [25] on the TRUP dataset. Briefly, the training
and the validation sets were normalized using the
empirical Bayes (EB) method [26] to build a joint dataset.
This tool is designed to reduce non-biological systematic
technical biases due to the use of chips belonging to
different production batches. After batch correction, the
entire 41-gene model was applied to the validation set
without any modification.

RNA was extracted from FFPE tissue slices
of primary tumors of the GHEA cohort using the
miRNeasy FFPE kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) according
to the manufacturer’s protocol and from frozen incisional
biopsies of the TRUP cohort using the miRNeasy MINI
KIT (Qiagen). RNA quality was checked by pre-analytical
screening using RT-qPCR as described [19]. Gene
expression profiles were generated using Whole-Genome
DASL (cDNA-mediated Annealing, Selection, Extension,
and Ligation) assay and HumanHT12_v4 BeadChips
(Illumina, San Diego, CA), according to protocol.
The Illumina BeadArray Reader was used for scanning the
arrays. Illumina BeadScan software was used for image
acquisition and recovery of primary data, after which the
data were quantile-normalized using BeadStudio software.
The BeadChips cover more than 29, 000 annotated genes
derived from RefSeq (Build 36.2, Release 38) and, after
filtering, a data matrix for the GHEA cohort and the TRUP
cohort were generated. The data were deposited at the
Gene Expression Omnibus repository (accession numbers
GSE55348 and GSE62327, respectively).

Bioinformatics analysis
Bioinformatic analysis was performed using R
[20], version 2.15, BioConductor [21], release  2.10,
and BrB-ArrayTool developed by Dr. Richard  Simon
and the BRB-ArrayTools Development Team
(v4.2.0, http://linus.nci.nih.gov/BRB-ArrayTools.html).
Gene-set enrichment analysis was performed using
GSEA v2.0.13 [22] on GO biological processes. Genes
represented by more than one probe were collapsed to the
probe with the maximum value using the Collapse Dataset
tool. Gene set permutation type was applied 1000 times
and gene set enrichment was considered significant at
p < 0.05, FDR <10%.

External datasets and signatures
TRAR was applied to HER2-positive patients of
the following public datasets (see Figure 1): Metabric
(treated with adjuvant chemotherapy alone) [27];
ii) GSE22358 (treated with neo-adjuvant chemotherapy
and trastuzumab) [28]; iii) GSE41656 (treated with
neo-adjuvant chemotherapy alone) [29]; and iv)
GSE50948 (treated with neo-adjuvant chemotherapy
alone or chemotherapy and trastuzumab) [5]. Microarray
data were processed starting from the authors’ raw data;
if raw data or processing methods were not available, the
processed data were retrieved. From the Metabric dataset,
132 cases were selected by IHC and HER2-gain obtained
by CNV data through Affymetrix SNP 6.0 chip SNP6
(IHC 3+ and IHC 2+ with HER2_GAIN). Raw gene
expression data profiled on HumanHT12_v3 BeadChips
(Illumina) were retrieved from the EMBL-EBI repository
(https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ega/datasets/) and RSN-normalized
using the R-package: lumi [30]. Raw data for GSE22358
and GSE41656 profiled on Agilent and Affymetrix
platforms, respectively, were retrieved from the GEO
repository
(http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gds/)
and
processed as described [28, 29].
Immune metagenes were determined based on
the method of Rody et al [10]. The 569 Affymetrix
ProbeSets were first mapped on the Illumina platform

Survival model development and performance
A survival model was developed in the GHEA53
training set. A disease-free survival profile was identified
using a semi-standardized method involving principal
component analysis [11]. Significance of each gene entered
into the model was measured based on a univariate Cox
proportional hazards regression of survival time versus
the gene log expression level. A 10-fold cross-validation
method was applied: 10% of the cases were omitted
and for the remaining cases, the genes correlated with
RFS at p < 0.001 were selected. Subsequently, principal
component analysis was used to reduce the dimensionality
of genes present in the model to capture most of their
variability. The first two principal components, PC1 and
PC2, were used to develop a prognostic model in which a
prognostic trastuzumab risk (TRAR) score was calculated
as: TRAR = α PC1 + β PC2, where α and β are the

and, among  7  immune metagenes, 3 were excluded
(MHC-I, MHC-II and IgG metagenes) due to low
gene number. Principal component analysis using the
pcaMethods R/Bioconductor package [31] was used
for genes contained in the remaining 4 metagenes to
determine the first component able to capture most of the
variation in the data.
The research-based PAM50 subtype predictor was
applied to the GHEA and TRUP datasets using the publicly
available algorithm as described [5] after performing median
centering of the PAM50 genes. For external datasets, we
used PAM50 subtype calls as previously reported.

Association among categorical variables was tested
by Fisher’s exact test. Two-sided p < 0.05 was considered
significant. Survival functions were assessed using the
Kaplan-Meier estimator, while log-rank test was used
to compare survival distributions; RFS was defined as
the time from start of trastuzumab treatment to the first
event of local, regional or distant recurrence. Pathological
complete response in the TRUP cohort was defined as
no residual invasive tumor or in situ carcinoma in the
primary tumor and in the nodes. Cox proportional hazards
regression models were used for survival analysis, and
hazard ratios (HR) were used to quantify the effects of
explanatory variables on event hazards [32].
