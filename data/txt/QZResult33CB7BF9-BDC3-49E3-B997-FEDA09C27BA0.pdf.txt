resistance would represent a major advance in our understanding
of disease progression and treatment failure.
KLF6 (Zf9/CPBP; GeneBank accession number AF001461) is a
member of the Krüppel-like factor (KLF) family, a group of zinc
finger transcription factors that are involved in differentiation and
development. Their role in growth-related signal transduction
pathways, cell proliferation, apoptosis, and angiogenesis originally
drew attention to their potential role in tumor development and
progression (5). The KLF6 gene was originally shown to be
functionally inactivated by loss of heterozygosity (LOH) and
somatic mutation in sporadic prostate adenocarcinomas (6). More
recent reports have extended the range of human tumors and the
mechanisms by which KLF6 can be inactivated to include deletion
of the KLF6 locus and mutation in colorectal cancers (7),
hepatocellular and gastric carcinomas (8, 9), LOH in ovarian
carcinoma and glioblastoma (10, 11), decreased KLF6 expression in
non–small cell lung cancer (12, 13), and hypermethylation of the
promoter region in esophageal SCC cell lines and HCC patient
samples (14). Most recently, three alternatively spliced KLF6
isoforms have been identified (15), and at least one of them,
KLF6-SV1, has been shown to be biologically active, antagonizing
the tumor suppressor function of KLF6 and promoting tumor
growth (10, 16). Overexpression of KLF6-SV1 in ovarian and
prostate cancer cell lines results in increased invasion, tumorigenicity, and dissemination (10, 17).
Although the exact mechanisms underlying the tumor suppressor roles of KLF6 are unknown, a number of highly relevant,
overlapping pathways have been described as follows: transactivation of p21 in a p53-independent manner (6), reduction of
cyclin D1/cyclin-dependent kinase 4 complexes via interaction with
cyclin D1 (16), inhibition of c-Jun proto-oncoprotein activities (18),
decreased vascular endothelial growth factor expression (10), and
induction of apoptosis (13). Given the evidence for a role for the
KLF6 tumor suppressor gene in lung cancer (12, 13), we sought to
define the role of the oncogenic splice variant, KLF6-SV1, in lung
cancer development and progression. A role of KLF6 in NSCLC was
first suggested by microarray studies (12). COPEB/KLF6 was
decreased in malignant compared with benign lung tissue, but
high KLF6 expression levels in tumor specimens were associated
with advanced disease stages and contributed to a prognostic gene
signature of poor survival (19, 20). This apparent paradox suggested
to us the possibility that at least two KLF6 splice forms with
different or opposing activities could be pertinent to lung cancer
biology.
In the present report, we address the question whether KLF6SV1 expression is dysregulated in NSCLC and whether it
contributes to tumor development and progression. We focused
our studies specifically on adenocarcinoma, the most common
NSCLC histology. We found that KLF6-SV1 was markedly overexpressed in primary human lung adenocarcinoma and was

Abstract
Kruppel-like factor 6 (KLF6) is a tumor suppressor gene that is
functionally inactivated in human cancer by loss of heterozygosity, somatic mutation, decreased expression, and increased
alternative splicing into an oncogenic splice variant, KLF6SV1. Here we show that increased expression of KLF6-SV1 is
associated with decreased survival in patients with lung
adenocarcinoma. In addition, KLF6-SV1 is a novel antiapoptotic protein in lung cancer cell lines, and targeted reduction
of KLF6-SV1 using siRNA induces apoptosis both alone and in
combination with the chemotherapeutic drug cisplatin.
Together, these findings highlight a critical role for KLF6SV1 in lung cancer, and show a potential novel therapeutic
strategy for the treatment of lung cancer. [Cancer Res

Introduction
The American Cancer Society estimates 162,460 deaths from
lung cancer in the United States for 2007, exceeding cancer
mortality from colorectal, breast, prostate, and pancreatic cancer
combined (1). Adenocarcinoma of the lung is the most common
histologic type among all lung cancers diagnosed. In non–small cell
lung carcinoma (NSCLC) the tumor-node-metastasis staging
system guides treatment and predicts the chance of long-term
survival. Patients with stage IA disease are treated with surgical
resection resulting in 5-year survival of 70% (2). In stage IB, IIA, and
IIB, surgery in combination with chemotherapy increases 5-year
survival by 5% to 15% (3, 4). Whereas in stage IV, the 5-year survival
is <1%, and chemotherapy and newer targeted molecular agents are
used primarily for symptom reduction with a median increase in
survival of at most 2 to 4 months (4).
The use of chemotherapy in the treatment of lung cancer is
supported by evidence from dozens of randomized controlled
trials. There is, however, significant variability in individual
response to chemotherapy and the development of resistance after
discontinuation of treatment. In fact, data from clinical trials of
chemotherapy estimate that >50% of patients derive no benefit
from chemotherapy and, thus, can be considered to have
chemotherapy-resistant lung cancer (4). In addition to these
patients, many others develop chemotherapy resistance during
treatment. Therefore, understanding and better defining the
molecular mechanisms underlying the development of treatment

xenograft experiments. Additional data and information concerning the
siSTABLE v2 system is available at Dharmacon.com.7 For transfection
experiments, 100,000 cells per 12-well dish were plated for each cell line.
Cells were then transfected with equal amount of the siRNA and harvested
at 72 h and 96 h for RNA, protein, and fluorescence-activated cell sorting
(FACS) analysis. For chemotherapy experiments, cisplatin (Sicor Laboratories) was added to a final concentration of either 10 or 20 Amol/L 24 h after
either plating of the pBABE/SV1 stable cell lines or transfection with si-NTC
or si-SV1 in all lung cancer cell lines studied.
Patient samples. After receiving patient consent and project approval
by the Institutional Review Board, tumor tissues and adjacent nonneoplastic lung tissues were collected immediately after resection between
May 1991 and July 2000 (by General Thoracic Surgery at the University of
Michigan Hospital), and a portion of each tumor and/or lung tissue was
frozen in liquid nitrogen and then stored at 80jC. Patient medical records
were reviewed to obtain tumor staging, pathology, and survival information,
and all identifiers were removed to protect confidentiality. Tumor cellularity
criteria for inclusion of each tissue sample into this study were reported
previously (5). A total of 70 lung tumors and 4 uninvolved lung samples
were analyzed. RNA was isolated using Trisol reagent (Life Technologies)
and purified using RNeasy columns (Qiagen, Inc.).
Western blot analysis. Cell extracts for Western blotting were harvested
in radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer (standard protocols; Santa Cruz
Biotechnology). Tumor tissue extracts were harvested and prepared in the
T-PER reagent (Pierce). Equal amounts of protein (50 Ag) as determined by
the Bio-Rad DC Protein quantification assay were loaded and separated by
PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Western blotting was
done using a goat polyclonal antibody to Actin; rabbit polyclonal antibodies
to NOXA, BCL2, Caspase 3 and 8 (Cell Signaling Technology); and
monoclonal antibodies to KLF6 2A2 (Zymed).

associated with poor clinical outcomes. Targeted down-regulation
of KLF6-SV1 using RNA interference (RNAi) in several lung
adenocarcinoma cell lines induced marked apoptosis associated
with induction of known proapoptotic and inhibition of antiapoptotic regulators. In addition, overexpression of KLF6-SV1
abrogated the proapoptotic effects of chemotherapy on lung cancer
cell lines. Finally, combination therapy using siRNA to KLF6-SV1
and cisplatin induced a marked increase in apoptosis compared
with either agent alone. Combined, these data suggest an
important role for KLF6-SV1 in lung cancer development and
points to a novel role for KLF6-SV1 as an antiapoptotic regulator of
cell death both alone and in combination with chemotherapy.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture and cell line generation. All cell lines were obtained from
the American Tissue Culture Collection. Retroviral infection with KLF6-SV1
was performed as previously described (10).5,6 Transient transfection of
nontargeting control and SV1 siRNA was performed with Lipofectamine
2000 (Invitrogen) in the A549, H838, and H1944 lung cancer cell lines.
The siRNAs used for these studies have been produced using the siSTABLE
v2 modification system patented by Dharmacon, which increases serum
stability to over 120 h compared with 12 h for traditional siRNAs. This
proprietary modification, which includes a silyl ethers used to protect the
5¶-hydroxyl in combination with an acid-labile orthoester protecting group
on the 2¶-hydroxyl, and sense strand inactivation, which minimizes offtarget silencing and enhances target specificity, were used for all culture and

The Role of KLF6-SV1 in Lung Cancer Progression
Analysis of proliferation. Proliferation was determined by estimating
[3H]thymidine incorporation. A549 stable cell lines expressing pBABE and
pBABE-SV1 were plated at a density of 50,000 cells per well in 12-well
dishes. Forty-eight hours after plating, 1 ACi/mL [3H]thymidine (Amersham)
were added. After 2 h, cells were washed four times with ice-cold PBS and
fixed in methanol for 30 min at 4jC. After methanol removal and cell drying
cells were solubilized in 0.25% sodium hydroxide/0.25% SDS. After
neutralization with hydrochloric acid, dpm were estimated by liquid
scintillation counting.
RNA and quantitative real-time PCR analysis. A panel of normal
tissues was obtained from Clontech; lung cancer patient samples were
collected and extracted as described above. Cell line and tumor RNA was
extracted using the Rneasy Mini and Midi kit (Qiagen). All RNA was treated
with DNase (Qiagen). A total of 1 Ag of RNA was reverse transcribed per
reaction using first-strand complementary DNA synthesis with random
primers (Promega). Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) was performed
using the PCR primers previously described (10) on an ABI PRISM 7900HT
Sequence Detection System (Applied Biosystems). All experiments were
done in triplicate and independently validated thrice. All values were
normalized to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) levels.
All primer sequences and methods for quantifying KLF6 alternative splicing
were performed as previously described (10, 15).5,6

FACS analysis. Cells were harvested from 12-well dishes and fixed in
absolute ethanol (Sigma) for 24 h. On the day of analysis, cells were pelleted
and the absolute ethanol was removed. Cells were then stained with a 1-mL
solution containing propidium iodide, RNase A, and PBS. FACS analysis was
performed on the FACSCalibur instrument (BD Biosciences).

Results
KLF6-SV1 expression is increased in lung cancer samples
and correlates with poor survival. qRT-PCR analysis of a panel
of normal tissues and 70 lung adenocarcinoma patient samples
revealed a 7-fold increase in KLF6-SV1 expression in lung cancer
samples when compared with a panel of normal tissue including
four normal lung samples (Fig. 1A; refs. 10, 15, 17). Interestingly,
wtKLF6 levels were decreased in lung cancer samples when
compared with either all normal tissues or lung tissue specifically
(data not shown). We next addressed the possibility that high
KLF6-SV1 expression could be an adverse prognostic factor in
this same cohort of patients with resected lung adenocarcinomas
of mixed stages (IA–IIIB), for whom clinical follow-up for up to
10 years was available. Based on previously published studies in

Figure 3. Overexpression of KLF6-SV1 in the A549 lung cancer cell line. A, qtRT-PCR analysis of pBABE and SV1 retrovirally infected A549 cells shows an
8-fold overexpression of SV1 in pBABE-SV1–infected cell lines compared with control cells (pBABE; ***, P < 0.001). B, SV1-overexpressing cell lines proliferate
significantly more than control cell lines; tritiated thymidine incorporation was determined at 72 h (***, P < 0.001). Columns, mean change in the rate of cellular

expression Bcl-2 and concomitant decrease in NOXA expression as determined by qRT-PCR (***, P < 0.001). D, overexpression of SV1 abrogated the proapoptotic
effects of cisplatin; pBABE and pBABE-SV1 cells were plated at equal densities and treated with 20 Amol/L of cisplatin; 72 h after treatment, cells were harvested.
FACS analysis of the treated cell lines reveals a marked reduction in the induction of apoptosis in SV1-overexpressing cells treated with cisplatin (17.4% versus
4.4%; **, P < 0.01). This experiment was repeated three independent times; representative FACS data are shown. E, overexpression of SV1 significantly abrogated

resulted in efficient and equal silencing of SV1 expression at both
the RNA and protein level at either 72 or 96 h posttransfection in all
three lung cancer cell lines tested with no effect on the expression
of other KLF6 isoforms (Fig. 2A; data not shown). Consistent with
our previous findings in prostate and ovarian cancer cell lines1,2,
targeted reduction of KLF6-SV1 resulted in a marked increase in
spontaneous apoptosis as shown (Fig. 2B). The induction of
apoptosis by targeted reduction of KLF6-SV1 was shown in all
three lung cancer cell lines tested (Fig. 2C).
Based on our previous findings1,2, we analyzed the expression of
specific proapoptotic and antiapoptotic genes at both the mRNA
and protein level in one of the transfected cell lines with siRNA to
SV1. Transfection of si-SV1 in A549 cells resulted in a significant
increase in poly(ADP)ribose polymerase cleavage and increased
expression of both active Caspase 3 and 8 (Fig. 2D). qRT-PCR for
the proapoptotic NOXA and antiapoptotic Bcl-2 was then
performed. NOXA mRNA expression was increased 6-fold in cell
lines transfected with si-SV1 compared with control, whereas Bcl-2
expression was reduced 80% in this same experiment at both the
mRNA and protein level (Fig. 2D). Together, these data suggest that
targeted down-regulation of KLF6-SV1 using RNAi results in

other tumor types (10, 15, 17), we calculated the amount of KLF6SV1 expression relative to the housekeeping gene GAPDH and
treated it as a continuous variable in a Cox multivariate survival
analysis, using a model that included tumor size and nodal stage,
two clinical prognostic factors that are well-established in NSCLC.
In a univariate analysis, KLF6-SV1 expression (P = 0.0091) and
nodal stage (P = 0.0288) were associated with survival (Fig. 1B).
A post hoc trichotomization of the sample set suggested a 6.5-year
difference in median survival between patients in the lowest
tertile of KLF-SV1 expression and in the highest. Together these
data suggest that KLF6-SV1 is overexpressed in primary lung
cancer when compared with normal lung tissue, and that
increased KLF6-SV1 expression is associated with poor survival
in lung adenocarcinoma patients.
Targeted reduction of KLF6-SV1 expression results in
increased apoptosis in lung cancer cell lines. To determine
the biological and functional relevance of these findings, we next
sought to directly target KLF6-SV1 using RNAi. Using chemically
modified siRNA, we explored the biological effect of targeted–
reduction of KLF6-SV1 on the behavior of three independent lung
cancer cell lines. Transient transfection of KLF6-SV1 specific siRNA

experiments. As predicted, overexpression of SV1 resulted in a
significant decrease in apoptosis in response to cisplatin treatment
(Fig. 3D). Similar findings were shown in the H388 and H1944 cell
line (data not shown). This change was associated with an
abrogation of Bcl-2 down-regulation and NOXA up-regulation at
the mRNA level (Fig. 3E).
Targeted reduction of KLF6-SV1 increases lung cancer cell
apoptosis in combination with cisplatin treatment. To further
characterize the role of KLF6-SV1 in the regulation of cisplatinmediated DNA damage and apoptosis, we measured the levels of
KLF6-SV1 after treatment with cisplatin. Increasing doses of
cisplatin resulted in up-regulation of KLF6-SV1 mRNA and protein
in the chemotherapy-resistant adherent cells, whereas KLF6 levels
remained unchanged (Fig. 4A and B). Based on these findings, we
hypothesized that increased expression of KLF6-SV1 may be
associated with cisplatin resistance. Combination therapy with
siRNA specific to SV1 and cisplatin resulted in the increased
activation of the intrinsic pathway of apoptosis (Fig. 4C). The
increased apoptosis seen with the combination therapy was
associated with a marked increased in NOXA expression at both

spontaneous apoptosis through activation of both the intrinsic and
extrinsic signaling pathways in lung cancer cell lines.
Overexpression of KLF6-SV1 results in increased cellular
proliferation and cell survival. To further characterize the role of
KLF6-SV1 and to determine the biological relevance of these
findings, we generated stable cell lines overexpressing KLF6-SV1 in
the A549 lung cancer cell line. Retroviral infection of this cell line
resulted in an 8-fold overexpression of KLF6-SV1 mRNA and
protein when compared with pBABE-infected control cell lines
(Fig. 3A). Overexpression of SV1 resulted in >2-fold increase in
cellular proliferation when compared with control (Fig. 3B). Of
significance, increased cellular proliferation was associated with
increased expression of Bcl-2 with concomitant down-regulation in
NOXA gene expression. Based on our previous findings that
targeted reduction of KLF6-SV1 results in a marked increased in
apoptosis, we sought to determine if overexpression of SV1
abrogated the ability of the chemotherapeutic agent cisplatin to
induce apoptosis. The IC50 for the apoptotic response of the three
lung cancer cell lines was determined (data not shown), and cells
were treated with that concentration of cisplatin for all subsequent

Figure 4. Targeted down-regulation of KLF6-SV1 increases the induction of apoptosis in combination with cisplatin. A, increasing doses of cisplatin result in increased
KLF6-SV1 expression with no changes in wild-type KLF6 levels as measured by qRT-PCR, using wild-type KLF6– and SV1-specific primers (10). RNA and protein
were harvested from adherent cells only after cisplatin treatment. B, Western blot of A549 cells treated with increasing doses of cisplatin probed with a KLF6 monoclonal
antibody shows increased KLF6-SV1 expression with higher doses of cisplatin. C, targeted reduction of KLF6-SV1 in combination with subtherapeutic doses of
cisplatin results in a significant increase in apoptosis in the A549 cell line (**, P < 0.001). Cells were first transfected with the indicated siRNA [nontargeting control
(NTC ) or SV1 (si-SV1 )]; 24 h after transfection, 10 Am of cisplatin or vehicle control was added to the cells. FACS analysis was performed at the indicated time points
(48, 72, or 96 h; *, P < 0.01). D, qRT-PCR revealed an additive effect in NOXA up-regulation after treatment of A549 cells with si-SV1 and cisplatin at all time
points assayed (48, 72, and 96 h; **, P < 0.001). Numbers above the bars, fold up-regulation in NOXA expression for each condition. All experiments were repeated

highlight a functional role for KLF6-SV1 in chemotherapy
resistance and provide a potential biological basis for our finding

Discussion
Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related death in the
United States. Patients with early stage disease can be treated with
surgery and have a 5-year survival exceeding 70%; however, the
prognosis of patients with metastatic lung cancer remains dismal
(4). A better understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying
lung cancer progression will allow for both markers for risk
prognostication to better guide treatment decisions and for the
development of targeted therapies. Here, we show that an alternative
splice variant of the KLF6 tumor suppressor gene, KLF6-SV1, is
specifically up-regulated in lung adenocarcinoma, and that
