Abstract
Acquisition of full T-cell effector function and memory
differentiation requires appropriate costimulatory signals,
including ligation of the costimulatory molecule OX40
(TNFRSF4, CD134). Tumors often grow despite the presence
of tumor-specific T cells and establish an environment with
weak costimulation and immune suppression. Administration
of OX40 agonists has been shown to significantly increase the
survival of tumor-bearing mice and was dependent on the
presence of both CD4 and CD8 T cells during tumor-specific
priming. To understand how OX40 agonists work in mice with
established tumors, we developed a model to study changes in
immune cell populations within the tumor environment. We
show here that systemic administration of OX40 agonist
antibodies increased the proportion of CD8 T cells at the
tumor site in three different tumor models. The function of
the CD8 T cells at the tumor site was also increased by
administration of OX40 agonist antibody, and we observed an
increase in the proportion of antigen-specific CD8 T cells
within the tumor. Despite decreases in the proportion of T
regulatory cells at the tumor site, T regulatory cell function in
the spleen was unaffected by OX40 agonist antibody therapy.
Interestingly, administration of OX40 agonist antibody caused
significant changes in the tumor stroma, including decreased
macrophages, myeloid-derived suppressor cells, and decreased expression of transforming growth factor-B. Thus,
therapies targeting OX40 dramatically changed the tumor
environment by enhancing the infiltration and function of
CD8 T cells combined with diminished suppressive influences
within the tumor. [Cancer Res 2008;68(13):5206–15]

Introduction
The tumor necrosis factor receptor family member OX40 is
expressed after activation of CD4 and CD8 T cells and has been
shown to play critical roles in the differentiation and long-term
survival of these cells (1–4). The ligand for OX40 (OX40L) can be
found on antigen-presenting cells activated in the presence of
strong adjuvant signals (5). T cells defective in expression of OX40
exhibited impaired generation of long-term memory when
challenged with antigen in the presence of adjuvant (3, 6). In the
absence of an adjuvant or danger signal, T-cell survival is extremely

poor even in the presence of functional OX40 (1, 7). Provision of
OX40 agonistic antibodies in the absence of a danger signal can
replace the adjuvant effect, resulting in enhanced expansion of
T cells and increased long-term memory T-cell populations (1).
The majority of reports have identified important roles for OX40
in CD4 function (1–4), although agonistic antibodies to OX40 also
have powerful effects on the proliferation, effector function, and
long-term survival of CD8 T cells (8–11).
Growing tumors have been shown to serve as a continued source
of antigen for T-cell priming in draining lymph nodes (12), and
both circulating and tumor-infiltrating tumor antigen-specific T
cells have been isolated from cancer patients (13, 14). Critical
defects in these T cells, which prevent full effector function (15),
can be overcome with in vitro restimulation (15) and in vivo
vaccination (16). The development of long-term T-cell tolerance
may be an important mechanism by which tumor cells evade
immune surveillance. Whereas OX40L has been observed on
antigen-presenting cells at sites of active autoimmune disease
(17, 18), it has not been identified within the tumor environment.
We and others have shown that systemic administration of
agonistic antibodies to OX40 (aOX40) can replace the absence of
OX40L within tumor-bearing hosts and leads to a significant
increase in survival of tumor-bearing animals (19, 20).
T regulatory cells, defined by expression of FoxP3 and
suppressive activity on naive T-cell proliferation, are of additional
relevance in consideration of OX40 agonist therapy in established
tumor models. The extent of T regulatory cell infiltration of tumor
has been correlated with poor prognosis in cancer patients (21, 22).
Depletion of T regulatory cells can significantly increase antitumor
immune responses (23, 24), and inhibition of their function may
have similar effects. Costimulation of TCR-stimulated T regulatory
cells through CD28, GITR, or OX40 has been shown to inhibit their
suppressive function (25–27). Therefore, aOX40 therapy may also
inhibit the ability of T regulatory cells to suppress other T cells
within the tumor environment.
For these reasons, we developed a model to examine the
mechanism by which systemic aOX40 administration improves
survival in mice with established tumors. In particular, we
examined the role of tumor-infiltrating CD8 T cells, T regulatory
cells and macrophages. We show here that a single administration
of aOX40 to mice with established tumors resulted in a significant
increase in CD8 T cells at the tumor site. Furthermore, these CD8 T
cells were shown to exhibit increased effector function and an
increased proportion of antigen-specific cells. Although we
observed a significant decrease in the proportion of T regulatory
cells in the tumor, the function of systemic T regulatory cells was
not affected by in vivo administration of aOX40. We show that
aOX40 induced changes in the tumor stroma; macrophages,
myeloid-derived suppressors, and transforming growth factor-h
(TGFh) expression were all decreased. These changes suggest that
administration of OX40 agonists to mice with established tumor

can override tumor-induced deficiencies of CD8 T-cell function.
Ultimately, these changes within the tumor may allow for improved
immune function and improved tumor immunotherapy.

Materials and Methods
Animals, cell lines, and in vivo antibodies. C57BL/6 (6–8 wk old) mice
were obtained from Charles River Laboratories for use in these experiments.
OT1 mice, with CD8 T cells specific for the SIINFEKL epitope of ovalbumin,
have previously been described (28). OX40 / C57BL/6 mice (29) were
kindly provided by Dr. N. Killeen (University of California San Francisco).
OX40 / OT1 mice were kindly provided by Dr. M. Croft (University of
California San Diego). These experiments used the MCA205 H12 sarcoma,
EMT6 mammary carcinoma, and CT26 colorectal carcinoma cell lines.
Control RatIg antibody was purchased from Sigma, whereas rat anti-OX40
antibody (OX86), CD4-depleting antibody, and CD8-depleting antibody were
produced in the laboratory from hybridomas and affinity purified over protein
G columns. All animal protocols were approved by the institution’s IACUC.
Tumor infiltrating cell harvest. C57BL/6 or BALB/c mice were injected
s.c. on the right flank with 1  106 tumor cells, and tumors were allowed to
develop a diameter of 5 to 7 mm. Mice were injected i.p. with 250 Ag antiOX40 or control RatIg, and tumors were monitored for 7 d. At day 7 after
treatment, mice were sacrificed and the tumor was removed. The tumor
was dissected into f2 mm fragments followed by agitation in 1 mg/mL
collagenase (Invitrogen), 100 Ag/mL hyaluronidase (Sigma), and 20 mg/mL
DNase (Sigma) in PBS for 1 to 2 h at room temperature. The digest was
filtered through 100-Am nylon mesh to remove macroscopic debris, and the
final cell preparation was separated by layering over Ficoll. Viable cells were
counted and stained for flow cytometry. Control experiments established
viable cell gating using 7AAD and confirmed that the cell preparation was
>95% positive for the hematopoietic marker CD45.
Ovalbumin-expressing tumor cell lines. A lentiviral vector containing
a transgene conferring surface-expressed ovalbumin was kindly provided by
Dr. H-M. Hu of the Robert W. Franz Cancer Center in the Earle A. Chiles
Research Institute. Tumor cell lines were infected with lentiviral vector at
a multiplicity of infection of f10:1 and went through two rounds of
fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) by surface staining with rabbit
anti-ova (Sigma) followed by goat anti-rabbit PE (Jackson Immunoresearch). Sorted cultures were functionally assayed for the stable presence
of ovalbumin by in vitro OT1 T-cell stimulation. To establish the more
immunogenic MCA205 H12ova tumors, C57BL/6 mice had to be tolerized to
ovalbumin via two i.v. injections of 500 Ag ovalbumin (Sigma) 7 and 2 d
before challenge with MCA205 H12ova.
Adoptive transfer. For adoptive transfer of naive OT1 cells, spleen and
lymph nodes were harvested from Thy1.1+ OT1 mice and the percentage of
CD8 T cells was calculated by FACS analysis. 2.5  105 CD8+ (OT1) cells
were transferred i.v. into Thy1.1 Thy1.2+ tumor-bearing animals. OT1
OX40 / mice did not bear the Thy1.1 congenic marker. Thus, in
experiments involving these mice OT1 cells were identified by staining
for CD8 along with the clonotypic Va2 and Vh5 TCR.
FACS antibodies and staining. Phenotyping of tumor-infiltrating cells
was performed using the following antibodies: CD8 PETxRD (Caltag); CD8
PECy7, CD4 APC, CD4 PacificBlue, CD4 PECy7, CD11b FITC, CD62L FITC,
CD62L APCCy7, CD25 APC, CD25 PE, Gr1 PE, Gr1 PECy7, IFNg APC,
TCRVa2 FITC (all Ebiosciences); TCRVh5 PE (BD Biosciences); unlabeled
Thy1.1 conjugated to PacificOrange in the laboratory using a POconjugation kit (Invitrogen); affinity-purified chicken anti-OX40 generated
by Aves Labs., Inc.; and biotinylated (Pierce) for detection with streptavidinPECy5 (Ebiosciences). Intracellular staining for FoxP3 was performed using
an EBiosciences FoxP3 staining kit. For intracellular cytokine staining,
1  106 tumor-infiltrating cells were stimulated with 1 Ag/mL anti-CD3 for
6 h at 37jC in the presence of Golgiplug (BD Biosciences). Cells were surface
stained, fixed with 1% paraformaldehyde, and then intracellular staining
was performed with an anticytokine antibody. Stained cells were analyzed
on a BD FACSCalibur for four-color staining or BD LSRII for eight-color
staining.

T regulatory cell functional assays. Mice were injected i.p. with 250 Ag
aOX40 or control RatIg, and spleens were harvested 7 d later. RBC were
lysed, and splenocyte preparations were directly stained with CD4-FITC and
CD25-PE. CD4+CD25+ cells were FACS sorted into >98% pure populations
and seeded in triplicate at 5  104 per well in a 96-well round-bottomed
plate. For purification of tumor macrophages, MCA205 H12 tumor-bearing
mice were treated with 250 Ag control RatIg or aOX40 i.p. and the tumor
harvested after 7 d. Cell suspensions were prepared as above and stained
with CD11b-FITC, Gr1-PE, and IA-PECy5. CD11b+Gr1hi and CD11b+Gr1lo
cells were FACS sorted to >95% purity and seeded in triplicate at 5  104 per
well. Responder CD8 cells were prepared from naive spleens by negative
selection using a MACS CD8-negative selection kit (Miltenyi) and an
AutoMACS cell sorter to 80% to 90% purity. CD8+ cells were then CFSE
labeled and washed thoroughly, and 5  104 per well were added to
triplicate wells containing media (positive control), T regulatory cells, or
macrophages. For preparation of accessory cells, splenocytes were stained
with CD3-biotin (BD Biosciences), then washed, and bound with antibiotin
beads (Miltenyi). CD3 accessory cells were negatively selected using an
AutoMACS cell sorter to 95% to 98% purity, and 2  105 CD3 accessory
cells were added to all wells. Cells were treated with 1 Ag/mL anti-CD3 and
harvested after 96 h. Harvested wells were stained for CD8 and CFSE
dilution in CD8 responder cells calculated by flow cytometry.
Tumor-infiltrating cell RNA analysis. Tumor-infiltrating cells were
prepared as above. For bulk analysis, total RNA was prepared from the
mixed population using an RNeasy kit (Qiagen). T regulatory cells and
macrophages were purified by FACS tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL)
stained with CD4 PECy7 and CD25 PE or CD11b-FITC. Total RNA was
prepared from the populations using an RNeasy kit (Qiagen). RNA (0.3 Ag)
was reverse transcribed into cDNA in a reaction containing 100 units MoMu
LV reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) in reaction buffer plus 5 mmol/L DTT,
500 mmol/L deoxynucleotide triphosphate, and 50 ng random hexamer
primers. This reaction volume (1 AL) was used in a PCR reaction using
HotStarTaq Plus Mix (Qiagen). Primer sequences were as follows: TGFh 5¶
CAAGGGCTACCATGCCAACTT, TGFh 3¶ ATGGGCAGTGGCTCCAAA (30);
GAPDH 5¶ TTAGCACCCCTGGCCAAGG, and GAPDH 3¶ CTTACTCCTTGGAGGCCATG. For comprehensive analyses of tumor-infiltrating CD8 T-cell
gene expression, tumor-infiltrating CD8+ cells were purified to >98% purity
by FACS and total RNA was prepared as above. Microarray assays and data
analysis were performed in the Affymetrix Microarray Core of the Oregon
Health and Science University Gene Microarray Shared Resource.

Results
Influence of systemic AOX40 therapy on the tumor immune
environment. To understand the mechanism by which aOX40
therapy caused immune-mediated rejection of established tumors,
we examined the phenotype and function of immune cells isolated
directly from tumors in three different models. The sarcoma cell
line MCA205 H12 was injected s.c. into the flank of C57BL/6 mice,
whereas the mammary carcinoma line EMT6 and the colorectal
carcinoma CT26 were injected s.c. into the flank of BALB/c mice.
Once the tumor reached 5 to 7 mm in diameter at f10 to 14 d
postinoculation, mice were treated with a single i.p. 250 Ag dose of
control RatIg or aOX40. At this time point, a single injection of
aOX40 causes significant growth delay 7 d after treatment
(Supplementary Fig. S1). Despite this effect, the aOX40 treated
tumors resume growth resulting in no significant survival benefit of
aOX40 treatment. To study the mechanism by which aOX40
influences tumor growth, 7 days after treatment, tumors were
removed and subjected to triple-enzyme digest and tumorinfiltrating cells were isolated by density gradient centrifugation.
Using multicolor flow cytometry, the phenotype of tumorinfiltrating immune cells was determined, applying the gating
scheme shown in Fig. 1A.

We and others have previously shown that OX40 is expressed on
recently activated CD4 and CD8 T cells, and aOX40 treatment leads
to enhanced expansion and survival of antigen-activated CD4 and
CD8 T cells (1–4, 8–11). After systemic aOX40 therapy, there was a
dramatic increase in CD8 T cells at the tumor site in the MCA205
sarcoma, EMT6 breast carcinoma and CT26 colorectal carcinoma
models (Fig. 1B). These changes were statistically significant and
represented a 2-fold (19.38 F 1.335:41.79 F 2.098), 4.5-fold (3.104 F
0.4836:14.29 F 2.363), and 2.5-fold (15.55 F 2.285:38.26 F 4.730)
change in CD8 proportion in the tumor site for the MCA205, EMT6,
and CT26 tumor models, respectively. It is notable that the most
immunogenic tumor, EMT6, exhibited the greatest CD8 response to
OX40 therapy. The change in percentage of CD8 T cells also
represented a significant increase in the number of CD8/mm3 of
tumor (10,480 F 1,746:21,280 F 4,275; Supplementary Fig. S1).

Cancer Res 2008; 68: (13). July 1, 2008

Interestingly, systemic aOX40 therapy did not increase the
proportion of CD4 T cells at the tumor site; the proportion present
in CT26 tumors actually decreased (Fig. 1C). Because untreated
tumors have a CD8 infiltrate, we sought to determine if
endogenous OX40-OX40L interactions were necessary for development of the endogenous CD8 tumor infiltrate. There was no
significant difference in the tumor CD8 infiltrate in untreated wildtype mice compared with OX40 / mice (Fig. 1D). These data
suggest that the growing tumor environment does not provide
OX40-specific signals and supports the rationale for administration
of OX40 agonists to tumor-bearing animals.
To understand whether the increase in infiltrating CD8 T
cells brought about by systemic aOX40 therapy represent a
simple increase in number or a functionally distinct population,
we further characterized these cells. To assess their function, the

tumor-infiltrating cells were stimulated in vitro with aCD3 in the
presence of secretion inhibitors and then stained for intracellular
IFNg. The tumor-infiltrating CD8 cells from all mice treated with
control RatIg were relatively unresponsive; few cells produced IFNg
upon aCD3 stimulation (Fig. 2A). However, aOX40 significantly
increased tumor-infiltrating CD8 T-cell production of IFNg upon
aCD3 stimulation in the sarcoma, breast carcinoma, and colorectal
carcinoma models (Fig. 2A). These data suggest that the CD8 T
cells within the tumor environment are functionally different after
administration of aOX40. Of the many surface markers analyzed,
only CD62L showed a significant change in expression (Fig. 2B).
These data were confirmed by obtaining highly purified CD8 T cells
from the tumor site by sorting and preparing RNA for microarray
analysis. CD62L mRNA was down-regulated in the tumorinfiltrating CD8 T cells (MCA205 4.29-fold, CT26 1.32-fold).
Infiltrating cells also showed decreased CCR7 expression
(MCA205 3.03-fold, CT26 1.41-fold), which along with decreased
CD62L suggests that tumor-infiltrating T cells tend to have an
effector phenotype. Simultaneously, increases in CCR5 (MCA205
1.62-fold, CT26 1.41-fold) and CXCR6 (MCA205 1.52-fold, CT26
4.59-fold) mRNA were observed. Each of the phenotypes are
suggestive of peripheral effector T cells trafficking to inflammatory
sites (31–33) and suggest that systemic aOX40 therapy resulted in a
qualitative change in the CD8 T cells and enabled them to infiltrate
the tumor site.
To identify whether this aOX40-induced increase in tumorinfiltrating CD8 T cells was due to recruitment of tumor antigenspecific T cells, we engineered MCA205 H12 cells to express the
model antigen ovalbumin and tracked ovalbumin-specific OT1 cells
in vivo. MCA205 H12ova tumors were established in Thy1.2+ mice
that had been previously tolerized to ovalbumin. Naive OT1 Thy1.1+

splenocytes were adoptively transferred to tumor-bearing mice
that were treated with a single 250-Ag dose of either control RatIg
or aOX40. Treatment with aOX40 significantly increased the
proportion of tumor-infiltrating Thy1.1+ OT1 T cells (Fig. 2C). To
determine whether the increase in CD8 T cells at the tumor site
was the result of direct OX40 stimulation on CD8 cells or was
indirect via stimulation of other OX40-expressing populations, we
examined the effects of aOX40 stimulation where the antigenspecific CD8 T cells were deficient in OX40 expression. Naive wildtype or OX40 / OT1 splenocytes were adoptively transferred to
mice bearing established MCA205 H12ova tumors. Mice were then
treated with a single 250-Ag dose of control RatIg or aOX40. aOX40
treatment resulted in a significant increase in tumor-infiltrating
Va2+Vh5+ OT1 cells, but only when the adoptively transferred CD8
T cells expressed OX40 (Fig. 2D). In these transfer experiments,
the endogenous CD8 T-cell response within the tumor stimulated
via aOX40 treatment was still intact (data not shown). These data
strongly suggest that OX40 expression on the antigen-specific CD8
T cells is required for the aOX40-mediated increase in CD8 T cells
within the tumor environment.
To understand the mechanisms by which antigen-specific T cells
accumulate in the tumors of treated animals, we adoptively
transferred CFSE-labeled OT1 cells to tumor-bearing mice and
analyzed the tumor, draining lymph node and nondraining lymph
node over a time course. OT1 were first seen to expand in the
draining lymph node, after which the cells accumulate at the
tumor site (Supplementary Fig. S2). No expansion or accumulation
is observed in the nondraining lymph node (Supplementary
Fig. S2). Examining the CFSE profile of the OT1 cells shows a
steady dilution of CFSE over time, indicative of rapid and continued division (Supplementary Fig. S2). Interestingly, whereas the

draining lymph node contains cells in a range of divisions, the
tumor contains only the leading edge of cell division. These data
support the hypothesis that the tumor-infiltrating CD8 T cells are
exclusively effector-phenotype cells that are generated in the
draining lymph node then traffic to the peripheral tumor site.
Role of T regulatory cells in systemic AOX40 therapy.
Growing tumors reportedly attract a large population of T
regulatory cells that express OX40, and treatment with aOX40
has been shown to suppress inducible T regulatory cell development and function in vitro (25–27). Thus, it is possible that
systemic administration of aOX40 suppresses T regulatory cells

resulting in enhanced CD8 T-cell effector function in vivo.
Intracellular staining for FoxP3 showed that a large proportion of
CD4+ cells within the tumor coexpress CD25 and FoxP3 (Fig. 3A).
These CD4+CD25+FoxP3+ T regulatory cells were also OX40+, which
was confirmed by analyzing tumors grown in OX40 / animals
(Fig. 3A). The population of CD4+ cells that were CD25+FoxP3+
T regulatory cells in the tumor was significantly decreased after
aOX40 treatment in MCA205 H12 and EMT6 tumors, but not in
the CT26 tumors (Fig. 3B). However, in the MCA205 H12 tumor,
this small change in percentage of T regulatory cells did not
represent a significant change when analyzed as the number of

CD4+CD25+FoxP3+/mm3 of tumor (3,348 F 1,376:2,292 F 469;
Supplementary Fig. S1). In view of the increase in CD8 T cells
described in Fig. 1, it is notable that the ratio of CD8 T cells to
T regulatory cells within the tumor was dramatically altered by
aOX40 in each model, from 6.2:1 (F1.615) to 13.3:1 (F1.736) for
MCA205, 4.2:1 (F0.3824) to 21.7:1 (F6.882) for EMT6, and 5.2:1
(F0.5814) to 22.1:1 (F3.774) for CT26. To determine whether
aOX40 therapy decreased systemic T regulatory cell function
in vivo, we purified CD4+CD25+ cells isolated from the spleens of
mice 7 days after control RatIg or aOX40. CD8 T-cell proliferation
was similarly inhibited by addition of CD4+CD25+ cells from
control mice or aOX40-treated mice (Fig. 3C).
Influence of AOX40 therapy on macrophages within the
tumor immune environment. Macrophages are a major cell
population in tumors and have been associated with both protumor
and antitumor activity. Staining MCA205 H12 tumors for CD11b
identified a large population of infiltrating macrophages (Fig. 4A),
which significantly decreased after systemic aOX40 treatment. The

www.aacrjournals.org

CD11b+ population within the tumor could be further subclassified
by expression of the immature myeloid marker Gr1 and MHC class
II into two distinct populations (Fig. 4B ). The immature
CD11b+Gr1hi cell population is phenotypically consistent with the
myeloid-derived suppressor cell population (MDSC) that has been
reported to inhibit T cell–mediated immune responses in vitro and
in vivo (34, 35). Interestingly, systemic administration of aOX40
significantly decreased this CD11b+Gr1hi cell population in the
tumor site (Fig. 4B). The frequency of both CD11b+ and CD11b+Gr1hi
was inversely correlated with the percentage of CD8 T cells at the
tumor site (Fig. 4C and D). Thus, aOX40 treatment significantly
elevated the ratios of CD8 T cells to CD11b+ and CD11b+Gr1hi cells
at the tumor site from 0.6:1 (F0.08725) to 3.3:1 (F0.6776) and 1.9:1
(F0.1797) to 17.8:1 (F3.923), respectively. The change in percentage
of CD11b+ and CD11b+Gr1hi cells also represented a significant
decrease in the number of these cells per cubic millimeter of tumor
(CD11b+ 23,230 F 3,565:12,320 F 2,529; CD11b+Gr1hi 5,426 F
1,171:1,919 F 405.8; Supplementary Fig. S1).

MDSC share some phenotypic features with neutrophils, which
have been shown to express OX40 and respond to OX40 ligation.
We have been unable to detect the presence of OX40 on MDSC at
the tumor site, suggesting that these are secondary effects of OX40
ligation on CD4 or CD8 T cells. To address this question, we
analyzed the effect of depleting lymphocyte populations on tumor
macrophages. We still observed a significant decrease in
CD11b+Gr1hi cells in CD4-depleted mice given aOX40 (Fig. 5A).
Depletion of endogenous CD8 cells significantly increased the
proportion of immature CD11b+Gr1hi cells in the tumor (Fig. 5A).
In the absence of CD8 T cells, the proportion of CD11b+Gr1hi cells
remained high even after aOX40 treatment (Fig. 5A). Thus, it

seems that CD8 T cells infiltrating the tumor influence the
attraction and/or differentiation of tumor-associated macrophage
populations.
Inhibitory molecule expression in the tumor immune
environment. We hypothesized that the changes in T regulatory
cells, macrophages, and CD8 T cells would further alter the
tumor environment. TGFh is an important cytokine in the
generation and function of both T regulatory cells and MDSC
(36, 37), and inhibition of TGFh effects on CD8 T cells has been
shown to enhance CD8 infiltration and effector function at the
tumor site (38). To determine whether aOX40 altered TGFh
expression at the tumor site, we isolated RNA from tumor
infiltrating cells and performed reverse transcription–PCR (RTPCR) for TGFh and the housekeeping gene GAPDH (Fig. 5B).
TGFh was expressed by the tumor-infiltrating cells from control
RatIg-treated mice and was less detectable in aOX40-treated
mice. Densitometry of the gels from Fig. 5C showed a significant
decrease in the intensity of the TGFh signal in tumor-infiltrating
cells from aOX40-treated mice (Fig. 5B ). Because TGFh
expression has been described in both T-regulatory cells and
suppressive macrophages (36, 37), we purified CD4+CD25+ and
CD11b+ cells from tumor-infiltrating cells by cell sorting. RT-PCR
showed that both T regulatory cells and macrophages expressed
TGFh RNA and the TGFh signal was not greatly altered in T
regulatory cells or macrophages by systemic aOX40 therapy
(Fig. 5C). These data suggest that the decrease in TGFh RT-PCR
signal in cells from tumors after aOX40 therapy may be due to
the decrease in number of TGFh-expressing cells (T regulatory
cell and macrophage populations; Figs. 3 and 4), rather than
reduced expression by individual cells.
Inhibition of CD8 T-cell responses by macrophages. A further
mechanism by which macrophages have been shown to inhibit
T-cell responses is through expression of arginase (39). The
presence of arginase expressing macrophages has been described
in tumors, and these cells have been shown to inhibit CD8 T-cell
responses (40). We purified CD11b+Gr1hi and CD11b+Gr1lo cells
from tumors by FACS and tested for arginase expression by
Western blot and enzyme assay. In agreement with the results of
Rodriguez and colleagues (40), predominant arginase protein
expression and enzyme activity was found in the CD11b+Gr1lo
mature macrophage population (data not shown).
To test the function of the different macrophage populations in
tumors, we purified CD11b+Gr1hi and CD11b+Gr1lo cells from
tumors by FACS sorting. These cells were tested for their ability to
inhibit proliferation of CFSE-labeled CD8 T cells in vitro .
Interestingly, whereas CD11b+Gr1lo cells purified from control
tumors greatly inhibited CD8 T-cell proliferation, this same
population purified from tumors in animals treated with aOX40
were much less inhibitory. The MDSC phenotype tumor
CD11b+Gr1hi cells from either control-treated or aOX40-treated
animals were not inhibitory in this in vitro assay. These data
strongly suggest that mature macrophages in the tumor environment suppress CD8 T-cell responses. Systemic OX40 therapy
changes the tumor environment and the function of the
CD11b+Gr1lo cells to make a significantly less suppressive
environment.

Discussion
The experiments reported here show that systemic administration of aOX40 results in profound changes in the immune status of

Figure 6. Function of tumor-infiltrating macrophage populations in T-cell
proliferation assays and the effect of aOX40. CD11b+Gr1hi and CD11b+Gr1lo
cells were purified from MCA205 H12 tumors grown in C57BL/6 mice 7 d after
treatment with control RatIg or aOX40. 5  104 CD11b+Gr1hi or CD11b+Gr1lo
cells were combined with 5  104 CFSE–labeled CD8+ cells from control spleens
along with CD3-depleted spleen cells as accessory cells and 1 Ag/mL aCD3.

the tumor environment. These changes included significant
increases in the percentage of CD8 T cells at the tumor site
(Fig. 1), with differentiation toward an effector phenotype and
evidence of increased function (Fig. 2). aOX40 therapy also
significantly increased the proportion of tumor-associated antigen-specific CD8 T cells at the tumor site, which required direct
interaction of aOX40 upon the antigen-specific CD8 T cells (Fig. 2).
While tumor-infiltrating T regulatory cells expressed OX40 and
there was a decrease in the proportion of CD4 T cells that were
T regulatory phenotype after aOX40 therapy (Fig. 3), the function
of T regulatory cells was not altered after systemic aOX40 therapy
(Fig. 3). These data diminish the likelihood that alteration in
T regulatory cell function was responsible for the influx of CD8
T cells into the tumors of aOX40-treated mice. aOX40 therapy also
changed the tumor stromal cells, causing a decline in both
macrophages and MDSC (Fig. 4). This effect was independent of
CD4 cells, but dependent on CD8 T cells (Fig. 5). We found that the
tumor-infiltrating cells from aOX40-treated mice expressed lower
levels of TGFh mRNA, although the decrease may be due solely to

www.aacrjournals.org

the reduced proportion of T regulatory cells and macrophages
within the tumor site (Fig. 5). Finally, we showed that the mature
macrophages purified from the tumor site greatly inhibited CD8
T-cell responses. Systemic treatment with aOX40 altered the
function of these cells, resulting in significantly less T-cell
suppression (Fig. 6).
These data suggest that aOX40 induced a shift in the immune
environment of the tumor. It has been widely reported that the
tumor is a relatively immunosuppressed environment (15, 41), with
infiltration by T regulatory cells (21, 22), suppressive macrophages
(42, 43), and production of inhibitory cytokines (38, 44).
Impressively, aOX40 therapy clearly influenced several of these
factors and seemed to do so primarily via enhanced infiltration of
tumors by tumor-specific CD8 cells. The access of effector cells to
the tumor is of critical importance to the success of immunotherapy for solid tumors. In contrast to models of metastasis, the
presence of large numbers of activated tumor-specific effector CD8
T cells does not necessarily correlate with efficacy in solid primary
tumors. In vivo experiments have shown limited tumor-specific
trafficking of adoptively transferred tumor-specific T cells (45).
Thus, modification of the tumor site to attract T cells can increase
the efficacy of adoptive T-cell therapies (31), but such therapies
require knowledge of or access to the tumor site. This issue
underscores the importance of the finding that a systemically
delivered aOX40 antibody caused an increase in tumor-specific
CD8 T cells at the tumor site. That this effect occurred with
endogenous effector cells is extremely valuable, because it does not
require labor-intensive techniques to generate tumor-specific T
cells or limit therapy to those patients or cancers with known MHC
or antigen status. We show here very similar effects in models of
sarcoma, mammary carcinoma, and colorectal carcinoma in two
different strains of laboratory mice, suggesting broad applicability.
Previous work from our laboratory showed that infusion of
OX40 agonists into tumor-bearing hosts resulted in increased
tumor-free survival in a variety of tumor models (19, 20, 46). The
agonists were delivered early after tumor challenge, and the
effects were lost if either CD4 or CD8 T cells were depleted
during the priming or effector phases (20, 46). The experiments
described here occur at times beyond early tumor priming, such
that the tumor-bearing animals may already have developed
functional effector T cells, albeit within a suppressive environment (47, 48). Thus, in these experiments, there was a lesser
requirement for CD4 T cells in the response and more of a
requirement to overcome CD8 tolerogenic mechanisms. Importantly, it has recently been shown that treatment with agonist
antibodies to OX40 can overcome CD8 anergy (49). This may
also distinguish our results from those of Song and colleagues,
where agonistic OX40 antibodies increased peritoneal accumulation of antigen-specific CD8 T cells (11, 50), but the effectiveness
was dependent on ligation of OX40 on CD4, not CD8 T cells (50).
In their experiments, CD4 depletion was performed before tumor
challenge; thus, there was no CD4 help during initial CD8
priming, most likely resulting in defective CD8 immunity. In our
model, where an initial endogenous immune response can
develop in the presence of CD4 T cells, aOX40 activity may be
more important to overcome subsequent CD8 anergy rather than
de novo priming. The mechanism by which this occurs remains
to be determined. Although we show that antigen-specific CD8 T
cells must express OX40 to accumulate in the tumor after OX40
therapy, they exist in a draining lymph node environment that is
also responding to the tumor and the OX40 therapy. Thus, the

precise interaction between CD4 and CD8 T cells in the
established tumor remains to be determined. One possibility is
simply improved survival of the OT1 cells. Alternatively, recent
data from our laboratory show that OX40 ligation on CD8 T cells
directly influences their maturation into full effector cells (51).
Notably, we showed the diminished presence of macrophages at
the tumor site, loss or maturation of the immature MDSC
population, and decreased TGFh mRNA. These changes fit very
well with our data showing the time course of T-cell
accumulation in the tumor and support the hypothesis that
the initial actions of OX40 therapy is on T cells that has
secondary consequences to the tumor environment. Thus, we
propose that one mechanism by which OX40 ligation on CD8
T cells enhances immune clearance of established tumors is
through these secondary changes that occur within the tumor
environment, potentially providing a therapeutic window for
effective antitumor immunity. In this way, decreased MDSC or
decreased cells secreting TGFh may feedback to decrease
differentiation of T regulatory cells (27) or permit further
accumulation of CD8 T cells (38).
However, a single administration of aOX40 may not be able to
sustain this positive environment. In the absence of further

adjuvant activity and in the face of continued tumor growth and
secretion of factors, such as TGFh, it is reasonable to expect
reestablishment of suppressive macrophage and T regulatory cell
dominance and subsequent CD8 T cell anergy or deletion. Further
studies will examine the effect of repeated aOX40 dosing of mice
with established tumors and the long-term consequences on the
tumor immune environment. Nevertheless, systemic treatment
with agonist OX40 antibodies provides critical signals for immune
reactivation without prior knowledge of tumor or immune
specificity and an opportunity for therapeutic intervention.
