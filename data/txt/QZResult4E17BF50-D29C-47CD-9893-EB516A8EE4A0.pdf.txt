Abstract
Small-molecule inhibitors of indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO)
are currently being translated to clinic for evaluation as cancer
therapeutics. One issue related to trials of the clinical lead
inhibitor, D-1-methyl-tryptophan (D-1MT), concerns the extent
of its biochemical specificity for IDO. Here, we report the
discovery of a novel IDO-related tryptophan catabolic enzyme
termed IDO2 that is preferentially inhibited by D-1MT. IDO2
is not as widely expressed as IDO but like its relative is also
expressed in antigen-presenting dendritic cells where tryptophan catabolism drives immune tolerance. We identified two
common genetic polymorphisms in the human gene encoding
IDO2 that ablate its enzymatic activity. Like IDO, IDO2
catabolizes tryptophan, triggers phosphorylation of the translation initiation factor eIF2A, and (reported here for the first
time) mobilizes translation of LIP, an inhibitory isoform of the
immune regulatory transcription factor NF-IL6. Tryptophan
restoration switches off this signaling pathway when activated
by IDO, but not IDO2, arguing that IDO2 has a distinct signaling
role. Our findings have implications for understanding the
evolution of tumoral immune tolerance and for interpreting
preclinical and clinical responses to D-1MT or other IDO
inhibitors being developed to treat cancer, chronic infection,
and other diseases. [Cancer Res 2007;67(15):7082–7]

Introduction
Tryptophan catabolism by indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO)
mediates a protolerogenic mechanism that suppresses T cells,
providing balance or feedback control in immune reactions (1, 2).
This role for IDO was first established with the demonstration that
the specific bioactive IDO inhibitor 1-methyl-tryptophan (1MT; 3)
can trigger T cell–mediated rejection of allogeneic mouse concepti
(4, 5). More recently, IDO has become recognized as a central
mediator of immune tolerance in many settings. In cancer, IDO
expression in tumor cells and antigen-presenting cells present in
tumor-draining lymph nodes mediates an important mechanism of
immune escape (6). IDO inhibitors trigger antitumor immunity
(7, 8) and act synergistically with conventional or experimental

chemotherapies (9, 10). Based on preclinical efficacy studies, the
stereoisomer of 1MT has emerged as a clinical lead inhibitor that
is entering human trials. D-1MT has superior antitumor activity
relative to the L stereoisomer in most preclinical models, and IDO
is genetically required for the activity of D-1MT (11). However, at
the level of biochemical specificity, the distinction between the two
isomers is complicated, with the D isomer exhibiting little
biochemical activity as an IDO inhibitor relative to L isomer (11).
In dendritic cells, both isomers block tryptophan catabolism
comparably but the D isomer is again relatively more active
biologically (11). Two possible resolutions to this disparity in
results are that D-1MT targets either an undefined cellular isoform
of IDO, for example, an alternate spliced or modified isoform, or a
different target. Here, we corroborate the latter possibility with the
discovery of a novel IDO-related enzyme that is a preferential
target for biochemical inhibition by D-1MT.

Results
IDO2 is a novel tryptophan-catabolizing enzyme that is
preferentially inhibited by D-1MT. We discovered IDO2 by Basic
Local Alignment Search Tool searches of the human genome
using IDO sequences as probes, identifying a new gene on
chromosome 8p12 just downstream of the IDO gene INDO. At the
time of discovery, genome annotation in this region referred to
an anonymous gene termed LOC169355 that was changed later
to a misannotated partial gene termed INDOL1 (IDO like-1;
Hs.122077). By trial and error, we identified exons permitting
assembly of a full-length IDO-related gene termed IDO2. This
nomenclature was chosen to distinguish it from INDOL1, which
remains misannotated as incomplete gene in the database.
By homology searching, we also identified the mouse orthologue
Ido2.
Oligonucleotide primers specific to murine and human coding
regions were used to amplify cDNAs by reverse transcription-PCR
(RT-PCR) from total RNA isolated from various tissues (Supplementary Figs. S1 and S2). In this manner, we obtained full-length
cDNAs with complete coding regions including four alternatively
spliced variants of each gene. The primary human transcript is
derived from 11 exons encompassing a 74 kb region of chromosome 8p12 (Fig. 1A and Supplementary Fig. S3). In three of
the five splice isoforms of IDO2 mRNA we identified, introduction of an out-of-frame stop codon causes a premature truncation of IDO2 protein. Transcripts are initiated only 5 to 7 kb

downstream of the INDO gene. The mouse gene seems to differ in
its lack of the alternate exon 1a found in the human gene;
otherwise, exon positions are conserved, indicating gene
duplication during evolution of this region of the genome.
Human and mouse IDO2 proteins are 420 and 405 amino acids,
respectively, and are more conserved (72% identical, 84% similar)
than IDO proteins (62% identical, 77% similar). Alignments
between IDO and IDO2 sequence reveal highly conserved features
that mediate heme and substrate binding (Fig. 1B), although the
overall level of sequence conservation is not particularly high
(43% identical, 63% similar for human). Significantly, residues
determined by IDO mutagenesis and crystallographic analysis to
be critically important for catalytic activity are highly conserved
in IDO2 (Fig. 1B).
To confirm the expectation that IDO2 catabolizes tryptophan, we
expressed it in a doxycycline-regulated T-REX cell system where
formation of the enzymatic product N-formyl-kynurenine (Kyn)
was monitored. Stable cell lines expressing V5 epitope–tagged or
untagged proteins with similar levels of doxycycline-induced
expression were used for analysis (Fig. 2A; Supplementary Fig. S4).
As expected, both human and murine IDO2 catabolized tryptophan
effectively as measured by Kyn production (Fig. 2B). Based on
IDO-IDO2 similarity, we compared the ability of known IDO

inhibitors to block the activity of IDO2 in T-REX cells. For reasons
mentioned above, the IDO inhibitor D-1MT was of particular interest
based on uncertainties about its biochemical target (9, 11). Therefore,
we evaluated how IDO1 or IDO2 activity was affected by the D
or L stereoisomers of 1MT, or by a third inhibitor MTH-trp (9).
Consistent with previous observations (11), we found that IDO
activity was modestly inhibited by L-1MT but not D-1MT. In contrast,
IDO2 activity was inhibited by D-1MT but not L-1MT. This pattern of
inhibition was specific to these 1MT isomers insofar as MTH-trp
inhibited the activity of both enzymes (Fig. 2C). These results
identify IDO2 as a relevant target for biochemical inhibition by
D-1MT, which may explain its well-documented antitumor effects.
IDO2 expression is more restricted than IDO but includes
dendritic cells. By RT-PCR analysis, we found IDO2 is expressed in
a subset of tissues expressing IDO. Primers spanning the complete
human coding region detected full-length mRNAs only in placenta
and brain, whereas primers specific to exon 10 ( found to be
common to all human IDO2 cDNAs) detected IDO2 mRNAs in
human liver, small intestine, spleen, placenta, thymus, lung, brain,
kidney, and colon (Fig. 3A and B). Although RT-PCR reactions
spanning exons 1 to 8 might not have been sensitive enough to
detect low-level transcripts, exon 1a–specific primers gave similar
results (data not shown), implying that other transcription start

sites may exist in human IDO2. Northern analysis of mouse tissue
RNAs confirmed a more narrow range of expression, revealing
detectable IDO2 transcripts only in liver and kidney (Fig. 3C). In a
query of the NCBI SAGEmap database with a sequence tag to IDO2,
the top four hits in terms of tag count prevalence were all identified
as bone marrow–derived dendritic cell libraries. Because D-1MT
inhibits kynurenine production in dendritic cells and block their
ability to activate T cells (11), we examined IDO2 expression in an
established predendritic mouse cell line (JAWII) that matures to
dendritic cells after treatment with IFN-g. IDO2 mRNA was
expressed in unstimulated JAWII cells, and IFN-g treatment and,
to a lesser extent, IL-10 or lipopolysaccharide treatment increased
levels modestly (Fig. 3D). Using an IDO2-specific monoclonal
antibody, we confirmed expression of IDO2 protein in JAWII cells
by Western blotting and indirect immunofluorescence microscopy,
the latter of which revealed a generally cytoplasmic pattern of
expression like IDO (data not shown). Although we could not
detect Kyn production in JAWII cells, we confirmed that full-length
cDNAs cloned from these cells encoded a fully active enzyme in
T-REX cells (data not shown). Together, these observations defined
a pattern of expression for IDO2 that includes dendritic cells.
Common genetic polymorphisms in human IDO2 compromise or abolish enzymatic activity. During characterization of
IDO2 cDNAs, we identified two single nucleotide polymorphisms
(SNP) that abolished enzymatic activity. One C-T SNP affecting R248
in human IDO2 was structurally analogous to R231 in human IDO,
which makes a critical contact with the indole ring of tryptophan
(12). The nonsynonymous substitution (R248W) reduced catalytic
activity f90% in T-REX cells (Supplementary Fig. S5). A second T-A
SNP affecting Y359 generated a premature stop codon (Y359X),
which completely abolished activity (Supplementary Fig. S5).
Strikingly, both SNPs were commonly found in human genomic
DNAs in public databases, with the C-T SNP being highly
represented in individuals of European descent, the T-A SNP being
highly represented individuals of Asian descent, and neither SNP
being as prevalent in individuals of African descent (Supplementary
Fig. S6). Thus, as many as 50% of individuals of European or Asian
descent and 25% of individuals of African descent may lack
functional IDO2 alleles. This analysis implicates these SNPs as
having a broad effect on IDO2 activity in human populations, which
may have a significant bearing on the interpretation of clinical
responses to drug-like inhibitors of IDO2 like D-1MT.
IDO2 and IDO each activate LIP, an inhibitory isoform of
immune regulatory transcription factor NF-IL6, but IDO2

produces a tryptophan-independent signal. Tryptophan catabolism by IDO triggers GCN2-dependent phosphorylation of the
translation initiation factor eIF-2a (13). Activation of this pathway
inhibits translation of most messages with the exception of certain
messages essential for stress-related functions. Additional contributions of IDO to tolerogenesis are imparted by Kyn and other
downstream catabolites (14–16). We evaluated the ability of IDO2
to activate this pathway in T-REX cells. In IDO-expressing cells, Kyn
production was constant for 4 days postinduction after which cell
growth rate slowed appreciably. This effect related to tryptophan
depletion rather than Kyn elevation, because supplementing the
culture medium with tryptophan rescued the effect (Supplementary Fig. S7). In IDO2-expressing cells, tryptophan consumption
was slower such that cell growth was not affected (Supplementary
Fig. S7). Nevertheless, induction of IDO2 caused GCN2-dependent
phosphorylation of eIF-2a like IDO (data not shown). To compare
downstream effects, we examined how IDO or IDO2 activation
affected translation of LIP, an inhibitory isoform of the transcription factor NF-IL6/CEPBh that is up-regulated by amino acid
deprivation by a switch to an alternate translational start site (17).
Both enzymes up-regulated LIP strongly, however, restoring
tryptophan to culture medium reversed LIP induction only when
stimulated by IDO (Fig. 4). Thus, IDO2 produced a distinct signal
for LIP activation that was independent of tryptophan availability.
This signal required catalytic activity because it was inhibited by
D-1MT (Fig. 4). These findings implied that IDO2 has a distinct
signaling role in cells compared with IDO.

Discussion
The findings of this study are significant and timely regarding
how tryptophan catabolism suppresses T-cell immunity, how
immune escape evolves during cancer progression, and how the
D stereoisomer of the widely studied IDO inhibitor 1MT, presently
entering phase I clinical trials, acts to elicit antitumor responses in
animals. Given the striking therapeutic effects of D-1MT in
preclinical models of cancer and other diseases (6), our findings
point to IDO2 as an important therapeutic target and genetic
modifier for understanding disease susceptibility. The existence of
widely dispersed genetic polymorphisms in human populations
that ablate catalytic activity argues that knowing the genetic status
of IDO2 of individuals enrolled in D-1MT trials may be important
for understanding clinical responses. Given the likelihood that
IDO2 may contribute to immune tolerance, two implications are
that individuals heterozygous or homozygous for catalytically
inactive alleles may be (a) less susceptible to developing diseases
driven by immune suppression, and (b) less susceptible to
manifesting clinical responses to D-1MT or other IDO2 inhibitory
compounds. Due to deficiencies in IDO2 activity, such individuals
may be relatively less prone to immune escape and malignant
progression of oncogenically initiated lesions, but relatively more
prone to autoimmune disorders. Given differences in the antitumor
responses seen in various preclinical cancer models to L-1MT versus
D-1MT (11), it may also be interesting to evaluate the murine IDO2
gene for related polymorphisms.
In LIP, we have defined a novel component of the tryptophan
catabolism signaling pathway triggered by IDO or IDO2, using it here
to reveal a mechanistic difference in how translational control by
these enzymes may modulate immune tolerance. As a downstream
reporter, LIP could provide a useful biomarker for genetic and
biochemical pathways activated by IDO1 or IDO2 in cells that express

NF-IL6 (also known as CEBPh). In essence, LIP is a dominant
inhibitory isoform composed of only the DNA binding region of
NF-IL6 (17). By interfering with target genes that control stress
signaling, cell growth, and immune modulation, LIP is well positioned
to mediate stable effects of IDO or IDO2 on immune tolerance
generated by antigen-presenting cells or other cell types. Using LIP,
we found that transient activation of IDO2 generates a stable signal
that persists independently of tryptophan availability. The potential
significance of this mechanism is that it could be used to propagate
tolerance from a local to a peripheral immune environment, away
from an initial site of tryptophan catabolism (18), for example, to
support cancer metastasis. Differences in LIP response argue that the
functions of IDO and IDO2 may be distinct, even if outcomes for
eliciting immune tolerance are similar.
IDO2 may address key questions about how 1MT manifests its
antitumor activity. Previous studies indicated that D-1MT can inhibit
tryptophan catabolism in human dendritic cells and that the IDO gene
is needed for antitumor activity, implicating IDO in the D-1MT
mechanism at some level (11). Our findings do not rule out
the possibility that 1MT may target an endogenous IDO protein
differing at some level, for example, due to posttranslational
modification (11); however, identifying IDO2 addresses a key gap in
knowledge concerning the biochemical target of D-1MT. In most
models, D-1MT displays much better antitumor activity than L-1MT
prompting the choice made for clinical development. One implication

is that compounds with dual specificity for IDO and IDO2 may
exert more potent antitumor efficacy, and MTH-trp fulfills this
expectation (9). Based on genetic knockout studies supporting a role
for IDO in the response to D-1MT at some level (11), our findings
strongly suggest cross-talk or cooperation between the functions of
IDO and IDO2 in immune regulation. Consistent with this idea, IDO
activity may be supported by other elements involved in tryptophan
catabolism (16, 19). In future work, it will be important to examine
IDO-IDO2 cooperation as well as how catabolites of tryptophan
catabolism may figure into IDO2 action.

Addendum
Recently we became aware of another group reporting the
identification of this gene (20).
