ABSTRACT
Prolonged treatment of breast cancer with epidermal growth factor receptor
(EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) often results in acquired resistance and a
narrow therapeutic index. One strategy to improve the therapeutic effects of EGFR
TKIs is to combine them with drugs used for other clinical indications. Ethacrynic
acid (EA) is an FDA approved drug that may have antitumor effects and may enhance
the cytotoxicity of chemotherapeutic agents by binding to glutathione and inhibiting
WNT signaling. While the α,β-unsaturated-keto structure of EA is similar to that of
irreversible TKIs, the mechanism of action of EA when combined with irreversible EGFR
TKIs in breast cancer remains unknown. We therefore investigated the combination
of irreversible EGFR TKIs and EA. We found that irreversible EGFR TKIs and EA
synergistically inhibit breast cancer both in vitro and in vivo. The combination of
EGFR TKIs and EA induces necrosis and cell cycle arrest and represses WNT/β-catenin
signaling as well as MAPK-ERK1/2 signaling. We conclude that EA synergistically
enhances the antitumor effects of irreversible EGFR TKIs in breast cancer.

the therapeutic efficiency of affordable medicine in breast
cancer.
The family of HER (ERBB) receptor tyrosine
kinases consists of four members: epidermal growth
factor receptor (EGFR, also known as HER1 or ERBB1),
HER2 (ERBB2), HER3 (ERBB3), and HER4 (ERBB4)
[3]. Overexpression, mutation, or aberrant activity of these
receptors contributes to the progression of breast cancer
by activating intracellular signaling cascades, including
the MAPK-ERK and PI3K/AKT pathways [3], [4]. HER2
is overexpressed in 15-20% of all breast cancers and is
correlated with poor prognosis. In addition, approximately
50% of all triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) and

INTRODUCTION
Breast cancer is the most common cancer and the
leading cause of cancer death among women worldwide,
with about 1.7 million cases and 521,900 deaths in 2012.
Although the incidence of breast cancer is much higher
in the developed world, mortality rates are higher in
the developing world, possibly because of the lack of
affordable treatment and reduced access to mammography
screening and tumor-receptor testing. Yet, even in the
United States, breast cancer has a 5-year survival rate of
only 23% for patients diagnosed with distant metastasis
[1], [2]. Therefore, it is necessary to continue to improve

inflammatory breast cancer overexpress EGFR [5]. Thus,
treatments specific to different morphological types of
breast cancer and relevant targets of the EGFR family are
emerging as promising options.
Afatinib (BIBW-2992) and neratinib (HKI-272)
are second generation irreversible EGFR family tyrosine
kinase inhibitors (TKIs) that are able to covalently alkylate
a specific cysteine residue close to the ATP-binding site
of the receptor [6]. Unlike first-generation EGFR TKIs,
such as gefitinib, clinical trials have suggested that these
new drugs can overcome resistance. A recent preclinical
study performed at the University of Washington identified
13 HER2 somatic mutations in breast cancers lacking
amplification of the HER2 gene. These mutations produced
a neomorphic phenotype with increased phosphorylation
of EGFR or HER2 and lapatinib resistance; however,
all mutant cells were sensitive to the irreversible TKI,
neratinib [5], [7]. In a Phase II trial, the pan-HER
inhibitor, afatinib, showed promising activity in patients
with HER2+ breast cancer whose disease had progressed
after trastuzumab treatment. Afatinib was also found to
have anti-proliferative effects on TNBC cell lines.
The rationale for assessing afatinib in our study was
based on the high EGFR expression in TNBC and the
assumption that uncontrolled ERBB signaling is related
to an increased oncogenic potential in TNBC subtypes.
However, the results from LUX-Lung 2 and 3 trials,
with a median progression free survival (PFS) of 12–14
months with first-line afatinib treatment in EGFR-mutant
non-small cell lung cancer, demonstrated that acquired
resistance (AR) is still a major clinical issue in treatment
with afatinib, due to crosstalk between pathways. These
findings suggest that afatinib and neratinib administered
at current clinically recommended doses may not be
sufficient to effectively suppress some cancers. Hence, it
is absolutely essential to find new strategies to improve
the therapeutic effects of these drugs and overcome AR.
Recently, it was reported that ethacrynic acid (EA),
which is used clinically as a diuretic agent, inhibits
glutathione S-transferase P1-1 (GSTP1-1) and WNT
activity [8], [9], [10]. Glutathione-S-transferase (GST)
is overexpressed in human tumors in the reduced form
glutathione (GSH) and binds to electrophilic compounds,
leading to detoxification of the cells. As a result, the
binding of EA to GSH enhances the cytotoxicity of
chemotherapeutic agents [9]. Additionally, aberrant
activation of the WNT signaling pathway has been
detected in breast tumors, and the expression of Frizzledrelated protein 1 (sFRP1), a secreted factor that inhibits
WNT signaling, is downregulated in many breast tumors
and associated with poor prognosis [11]. Interestingly,
the chemical structure of α,β-unsaturated keto functional
group of EA is similar to that of irreversible TKIs, as
shown below; however, the role of EA’s combinational
function on the irreversible EGFR TKIs in breast cancer

www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

remains unknown. Thus, we asked whether EA could
potentiate the antitumor effects of irreversible EGFR TKIs
in breast cancer.

RESULTS
The cytotoxic effect of irreversible EGFR TKIs
and ethacrynic acid on breast cancer cell lines
To investigate the toxicity of irreversible EGFR
TKIS (afatinib and neratinib) and ethacrynic acid (EA)
on breast cells lines, MCF7, MDA-MB-321 and 4T1 cells
were treated with afatinib, neratinib and EA at different
concentrations for 24h. Cytotoxicity was calculated based
on cell viability as determined by CCK8 assays. As shown
in Figure 1A-1C, the rate of cell death increased with drug
concentration in all three cell lines. The half maximal
inhibitory concentrations (IC50) of afatinib, neratinib
and EA for MCF7, MDA-MB-231 and 4T1 in 24h were
tested by CCK8 assay. We chose the 30%~40% inhibitory
concentration of afatinib (4 μm), neratinib (4 μm) and EA
(25 μm) in these cells for subsequent experiments.

Combination treatment of irreversible EGFR
TKIs with ethacrynic acid has synergistic
antitumor effects on breast cancer cells
We next determined the effect of combination
treatment with irreversible EGFR TKIs and EA on
inhibiting the proliferation of breast cancer cells using
CCK8 assays. As shown in Figure 1D, while treatment
with afatinib or neratinib alone modestly reduced the
viability of MCF7, MDA-MB-231 and 4T1 cells,
combining these drugs with EA resulted in decreased
cell viability (P<0.05). Among the three cell types,
the combination effect on 4T1 cells was the most
dramatic (P<0.001). These combination effects were
further evaluated on the basis of the coefficient of drug
interaction (CDI). As shown in Table 1, the CDI of afatinib
or neratinib in combination with EA in the three breast
cancer cells was less than 1, which means the drugs acted
synergistically. The synergistic effect on 4T1 cell was the
most obvious (CDIAE=0.23, CDINE=0.24). In addition, the
effect of afatinib combined with EA was more pronounced
than the effect of neratinib combined with EA.

Combination treatment with irreversible EGFR TKIs and ethacrynic acid (EA) had a synergistic antitumor effect in breast
cancer cells. The results are from one representative experiment. Similar results were obtained in three experiments.

Combination treatment with irreversible EGFR
TKIs and ethacrynic acid inhibits breast cancer
cell cycle progression and induce cell death to
repress tumor growth

Combination treatment with irreversible EGFR
TKIs and ethacrynic acid co-suppresses the
WNT and MAPK signaling pathways to repress
tumor growth

To analyze the mechanism of synergistic inhibitory
effects induced by the combination of either afatinib or
neratinib with EA, we examined whether these changes
of tumor cell growth were related to the cell cycle and
apoptosis. Cell cycle analysis on the breast cancer cell
lines indicated that afatinib combined with EA blocked
cell cycle progression of MCF7 cells at G2/M phase and
MDA-MB-231 cells at S phase and G2/M phase. Neratinib
combined with EA blocked cell cycle progression of both
MCF7 and MDA-MB-231 cells at G2/M phase (P<0.01;
Figure 2A-2B). In addition, as shown in Figure 3A-3C,
when compared with afatinib, neratinib, alone, the number
of necrotic cells was increased in all breast cancer cell
lines with the combination of afatinib or neratinib with
EA (P < 0.01). These results indicate that the combination
groups inhibit cancer cells growth by blocking cell cycle
progression and inducing necrotic.

Autocrine WNT signaling contributes to breast
cancer cell proliferation via the canonical WNT
pathway and EGFR transactivation [11]. Therefore, we
investigated whether the molecular mechanism of the
synergistic inhibitory effect induced by the combination
of afatinib or neratinib with EA was dependent upon the
suppression of MAPK-ERK1/2 signaling. As shown in
Figure 5, qRT-PCR revealed that afatinib combined with
EA suppressed the ERK1, ERK2, EGFR, AKT, mTOR,
WNT5a and catenin mRNA in MCF7 and MDA-MB-231
cells compared to irreversible EGFR TKIs alone (Figure
5A-5G), but it is interesting that combined irreversible
EGFR TKIs with EA didn’t have obvious suppression on
ERK2 in 4T1 (Figure 5C). The combination of neratinib
could suppress EGFR, AKT mRNA in MCF7 and MDAMB-231 cells compared to neratinib alone (Figure
5A&5D). Consistent with the mRNA results, as shown
in Figure 6, combined with EA in MCF7 and MDAMB-231 cells increased p-ERK1/2 expression and reduced
expression of ERK1, p-mTOR, mTOR, and WNT5a when
compared with afatinib or neratinib alone, while levels
of p-mTOR, and mTOR in 4T1 cells also showed similar
trends. Interestingly, although EA or it combined with
TKIs decreased the expression of ERK1/2 in human breast
cancer cell lines(MCF7;MDA-MB-231) but the p-ERK1/2
was increased.

Combination treatment with irreversible EGFR
TKIs and ethacrynic acid enhances antitumor
effects in vivo
To evaluate whether combined treatment with EA
and either afatinib or neratinib had stronger anti-tumor
effects in vivo, 4T1 breast cancer cells were implanted
subcutaneously into the back of syngeneic Balb/c mice.
When all these tumors reached 62.5mm3 in volume at least,
mice were treated with afatinib (20 mg/kg) or neratinib
(20 mg/kg) alone or together with EA (250 ug/day) for 3
weeks [16], [17], [18]. Consistent with our in vitro results,
monotherapy with afatinib or neratinib decreased tumor
growth, but treatment with the combination of afatinib
or neratinib and EA led to marked tumor shrinkage. It
is notable that afatinib combined with EA improved
the tumor growth inhibition rate of afatinib alone by
34.2%. While neratinib combined with EA improved the
inhibition of tumor growth compared to neratinib alone by
only 22.4% (Figure 4).

DISCUSSION
Cancer treatments based on blocking EGFR
signaling are emerging as promising alternatives;
however, tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) show only
modest effects on most cancer types. Particularly for
patients with advanced tumors, single-agent TKI therapy
has a narrow therapeutic index. In addition, the majority
of positive responses to TKIs is merely palliative and
often unpredictable. Unfortunately, a large number of
patients fail to achieve initial responses or improvements

in survival with currently available TKIs [19]. Thus, it is
urgent to find a new strategy to improve therapeutic effects
on cancer patients. In this study, we investigated the
effects of ethacrynic acid (EA) combined with irreversible
EGFR TKIs on breast cancer both in vitro and in vivo. We
found that a safe dose of EA extends the therapeutic effect
of irreversible EGFR TKIs on breast cancer.
Previous studies have demonstrated that EA and
its analogues are glutathione transferase P1-1 (GSTP1-1)
and WNT inhibitors and that EA alone induces cell death
in malignant cells at high concentrations. EA exhibits
selective toxicity to chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells
by inhibiting the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway [8].
EA analogues inhibit the migration of human prostate
cancer and breast cancer cell lines, which provide a good
model system to study migration and invasion since they
represent metastatic cancer [20], [21]. Zhang et al. (2013)
[22] also reported on a novel oxadiazole analogue of EA,
EA6r, that inhibits the proliferation of a range of human
colon, leukemia, prostate, lung, breast, ovarian, and

cervical tumor cell lines by inducing cell apoptosis and
S-phase arrest. The antitumor activity of this EA analogue
was also shown in tumor xenografts. These results are
consistent with our q-PCR data showing that EA inhibited
the expression of genes downstream of WNT5a/β-catenin
and MAPK-ERK1/2-mTOR.
GSTP1-1 is overexpressed in tumor cells,
suggesting that it may contribute to their drug resistance.
Based on that, inhibitors of GSTP1-1 are expected to
counteract drug resistance and serve as adjuvants in
cancer chemotherapy by increasing efficacy. Finding other
useful inhibitors among compounds used for other clinical
indications might be a shortcut to clinical applications
[23]. For example, EA improves the antitumor effects
of arsenic trioxide (ATO) in myeloid leukemia and
lymphoma cells by inducing apoptosis and inhibiting
GSTP1-1 [24]. In addition, EA combined with selenite
prevents the development of GST-dependent cisplatin
resistance in a model of human H562 small cell lung
cancer [25]. Analogous to these previous studies, our

results showed a synergistic effect of EA with irreversible
EGFR TKIs in breast cancer. The combination treatment
not only inhibited proliferation in vitro but also repressed
tumor growth in vivo. Specifically, afatinib combined with
EA remarkably reduced tumor volume 30% more than
treatment with afatinib or neratinib alone.
TKIs primarily activate MAPK-ERK and PI3K/
AKT/mTOR pathways, while EA acts on the WNT/βcatenin pathway. One study has investigated the role
of WNT/β-catenin in breast cancer and found that
WNT pathway signaling was increased in cancer tissue
compared to normal breast. Furthermore, expression of
WNT pathway genes correlated with estrogen receptor
(ER) expression, especially WNT5a and WNT5b, with
approximately 50% of breast cancer tissues overexpressing
these genes [26]. Additionally, there was a finding that
autocrine WNT signaling activates the extracellular signalwww.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) pathway in mammary
epithelial cells via EGFR transactivation [11]. As shown in
Figure 5 & 6, the mRNA and protein expression of ERK1
and ERK2 in MCF7 cells were inhibited by combination
EA treatment more than with afatinib or neratinib alone.
This is likely because MCF7 cells expressing ER are more
sensitive to EA alone compared to other agents. Moreover,
expression of mTOR, which is downstream of ERK1/2,
was lower in MCF7 cells treated with EA than in cells
treated with afatinib or neratinib alone. The inhibitory
effects of EA in TNBC cells were weaker than in MCF7
cells, probably because 50% of TNBC cells overexpress
EGFR, and afatinib and neratinib also target EGFR. It
is clear from our results that the combination of afatinib
or neratinib with EA also improves antitumor action by
enhancing the inhibitory effects of the ERK or mTOR
pathways. In our study, pERK was also increased by
58047

Oncotarget

combination treatment. Anti-tumor drugs also activate p38
and pERK1/2 in the MAPK signaling pathway, and this
activity may be related to autophagy [10]. Therefore the
mechanism of pERK1/2 in cancer therapy needs further
study.
In summary, we demonstrate for the first time that
EA synergistically augments the antitumor effects of
irreversible EGFR TKIs in breast cancer. These effects
were seen not only in HER2 or ER positive breast cancers,
but also in TNBC cells. Further investigation is required
to fully reveal the effects of these combination treatments
on different breast cancer subtypes. The combination
therapeutic effects of EA with irreversible EGFR TKIs in
breast cancer are worthy of clinical evaluation in humans.

cells were regarded as apoptotic.

In vivo studies
For mouse studies, female BALB/c mice (5-6
weeks of age) were obtained from Guangdong province
Laboratory Animal Center (Guangzhou, China). 4T1 cells
(2×105) were suspended in 0.1ml phosphate buffered
saline (PBS) and then injected subcutaneously into the
backs of the mice. Tumor growth was measured over
the course of 30 days, and tumor volume was calculated
according to the formula: volume = 0.5× length × width2.
All experiments were performed in accordance with the
Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals, with
the approval of the Shenzhen University, Shenzhen, China.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell culture and reagents

Coefficient of drug interaction (CDI)

All cells were obtained from the Institute of
Biochemistry and Cell Biology of Chinese Academy of
Science (Shanghai, China). Human breast cancer cell lines
(MCF7 and MDA-MB-231) and mouse breast cancer
cells (4T1) were maintained in RPMI 1640 with 10%
fetal bovine serum (FBS) (PAA Laboratories, Pasching,
Australia) in a humidified atmosphere containing 5%
CO2 at 37°C. Afatinib and neratinib were purchased from
Selleck Chemicals company (USA), and ethacrynic acid
was obtained from Sigma (USA).

The coefficient of drug interaction (CDI) was used
to analyze the synergistically inhibitory effect of drug
combinations. CDI was calculated as follows: CDI =
AB/(A × B). According to the absorbance of each group,
AB is the ratio of the combination groups to the control
group; A or B is the ratio of a single agent group to control
groups. Thus a CDI value less than, equal to, or greater
than 1 indicates that the drugs are synergistic, additive, or
antagonistic, respectively. A CDI less than 0.7 indicates
that the drugs are significantly synergistic [14].

Cell proliferation assay

RNA extraction and quantitative RT-PCR

The in vitro cell proliferation of breast cancer cell
lines were determined by WST-8 staining with the Cell
Counting Kit-8 (Dojinodo, Shanghai, China) according
to the manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, cells were
seeded in 96-well plates in a density of 6000 cells/well and
incubated for 24 h followed treated with afatinib, neratinib
with or EA for 24h. Then cells were stained with WST-8
followed by determination of OD 450 nm with a reference
wavelength at 600 nm. The data were analyzed using
Graphpad Prism 5 software to obtain the IC50 [12].

Total RNA, including miRNA, was extracted
using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA)
according to the manufacturer's instructions. cDNAs were
synthesized using ReverTra Ace qPCR RT kit (FSQ-101;
Toyobo, Kagoshima, Japan). Real-time PCR analyses were
performed with Thunderbird SYBR qPCR mix (QPS-201;
Toyobo) on an MxPro Mx3000P Sequence Detection
system (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA, USA). β-actin was used
as an internal normalized reference, and fold changes were
calculated by relative quantification (2-ΔΔCt). The primer
sequences are shown in Table 2.

Western blots

Cells were fixed in 70% ethanol at 4°C for 24h,
stained with 50 ug/ml propidium iodide and 1 mg/
ml ribonuclease A (Kaiji, Nanjing, China) at room
temperature for 30min, and analyzed by FACS Caliber
(BD Bioscience, MA, USA).

Antibodies for EGFR, p-EGFR, HER2, p-HER2,
ERK1/2, p-ERK1/2, PI3K, p-PI3K, mTOR, p-mTOR,
p-AKT, Wnt5a/b, β-catenin, β-actin, were purchased
from Cell Signaling Technology (MA, USA). Cells were
harvested and lysed with M-PER Protein Extraction
Reagent (Pierce, IL, USA) supplemented with protease
inhibitor cocktail. Protein concentrations of the extracts
were measured using the BCA assay (Pierce, CA, USA)
and equalized with the extraction reagent. Equal amount
of the extracts were loaded and subjected to SDS-PAGE,

Apoptosis assay
24h after treatment with drugs, cells were harvested,
washed, re-suspended in the binding buffer, and examined
with the Vybrant Apoptosis Assay kit (Invitrogen,
Carlsbad, CA, USA). Stained cells were detected by FACS
