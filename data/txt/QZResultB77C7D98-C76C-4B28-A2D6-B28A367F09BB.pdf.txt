ABSTRACT
Recent studies have shown that fusarochromanone (FC101), a mycotoxin, is
cytotoxic in a variety of cell lines. However, the molecular mechanism underlying
its cytotoxicity remains elusive. Here we found that FC101 induced cell death in
COS7 and HEK293 cells in part by activating JNK pathway. This is evidenced by the
findings that inhibition of JNK with SP600125 or expression of dominant negative
c-Jun partially prevented FC101-induced cell death. Furthermore, we observed
that FC101-activated JNK pathway was attributed to induction of reactive oxygen
species (ROS). Pretreatment with N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC), a ROS scavenger and
antioxidant, suppressed FC101-induced activation of JNK and cell death. Moreover,
we noticed that FC101 inhibited the serine/threonine protein phosphatases 2A (PP2A)
and 5 (PP5) in the cells, which was abrogated by NAC. Overexpression of PP2A or
PP5 partially prevented FC101-induced activation of JNK and cell death. The results
indicate that FC101-induced ROS inhibits PP2A and PP5, leading to activation of JNK
pathway and consequently resulting in cell death.

Furthermore, FC101 has recently been found to inhibit
cell proliferation and differentiation as well as induce cell
death in lymphocytes, osteoblasts, melanoma cells, breast
cancer cells, glioblastoma cells, normal cardiac fibroblasts
and kidney cells [11–16]. Despite these findings, how
FC101 causes cytotoxicity is not well understood.
Studies have demonstrated that the toxicity of many
mycotoxins is often related to induction of oxidative
stress, such as reactive oxygen species (ROS), in various
types of cells [17–26]. Certain levels of ROS are critical
for many physiological functions of all aerobic organisms
[27]. However, excessive ROS may disturb metabolic
pathways; deplete cellular antioxidants; damage DNA,
proteins and lipids; and activate/inhibit related signaling
pathways [27]. Consequently, this results in inhibition

INTRODUCTION
Fusarochromanone (FC101) is a mycotoxin
produced by food-borne fungi such as Fusarium equiseti
(F. equiseti) and F. roseum. The wide presence and
persistence of this mycotoxin in the food chain may lead
to an inevitable exposure to humans and animals [1–4].
The contamination of FC101 in the feedstuffs was first
discovered to cause avian tibial dyschondroplasia (ATD)
in broiler chickens, a disease characterized by bone
deformation [2, 5–8]. Later, FC101 was also suspected
to be associated with etiology of Kashin-Beck disease
(a chronic and endemic osteochondropathy) in children
in northeastern and southwestern China, as well as
in southeastern Siberia and northern Korea [9, 10].

of cell differentiation or proliferation and even induction
of cell death [27–30]. Recently, it has been noticed
that FC101 can induce ROS in glioblastoma cells [14].
However, it is unclear whether and how FC101 exerts its
cytotoxicity by induction of ROS.
Increasing evidence has implicated that the members
of the mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) family
play a critical role in the regulation of cell survival
[31]. Particularly, in response to stress stimuli, e.g.
oxidative stress, MAPKs can be activated, leading to
apoptosis [29, 30]. There are at least three distinct subfamilies of MAPKs, including the extracellular signalregulated kinases Erk1/2, Erk3/4, Erk5, Erk7/8, the
c-Jun N-terminal kinases JNK1/2/3, and the p38 MAPKs
p38α/β/γ/δ in mammalian cells [31–33]. Activation of
MAPKs requires phosphorylation of certain tyrosine,
serine and/or threonine residues in the activation loops [31].
Phosphorylation of MAPKs is balanced by specific MAPK
kinases and phosphatases [31, 32]. It has been demonstrated
that MAPK phosphatase 1 (MKP-1) and protein
phosphatase 2A (PP2A) negatively regulate Erk1/2, JNK
and/or p38, whereas protein phosphatase 5 (PP5) negatively
regulates JNK/p38 pathway [29, 30, 34–37]. Further, protein
phosphatase 1 (PP1) can also negatively regulate both JNK
and p38 MAPK [38]. PP2A, a serine and threonine protein
phosphatase, is a heterotrimeric holoenzyme composed
of a catalytic subunit (PP2Ac), an A regulatory subunit
(PP2A-A, also termed PR65), and a number of B regulatory
subunits (PP2A-B), including B (PR55), B’ (PR61),
B” (PR72) and B’” (PR93/PR110) [39]. The phosphatase
activity of PP2Ac or PP5 is modulated by association with
the regulatory subunits of PP2A-A and PP2A-B [34, 39].
Also, PP2A activity is mediated by the phosphorylation
and methylation of PP2Ac [40, 41]. Accumulating
data have shown that PP2A can negatively regulate the
phosphorylation of Erk1/2, JNK and p38, whereas PP5 can
negatively regulate the phosphorylation of JNK/p38 under
stress conditions [29, 30, 34–37].
Here, for the first time, we show that FC101-induced
ROS caused cell death, by activation of JNK cascade in
COS7 and HEK293 cells. Furthermore, we identified that
FC101-induced ROS activated JNK pathway, by inhibiting
PP2A and PP5. Our findings suggest that the toxicity
of FC101 in humans and animals may be prevented
and treated by pharmacological interventions, such as
antioxidants and JNK inhibitors.

concentration-dependent decrease of cell viability in both
COS7 and HEK293 cells. The decreased cell viability was
in agreement with the increased levels of ROS (Fig. 1B).
The data imply that the induction of ROS by FC101
might be associated with the cytotoxicity in COS7 and
HEK293 cells.
To confirm whether FC101-induced cytotoxicity is
indeed due to ROS induction, COS7 and HEK293 were
pretreated for 1 h with 5 mM of NAC (a ROS scavenger
and antioxidant), and then exposed to FC101 (0–1 μM)
for 24 h (for ROS detection) or 4–6 days (for cell
viability assay or morphological analysis). As expected,
pretreatment with NAC strongly blocked FC101 induction
of ROS in the cells (Fig. 2A and 2B). Also, NAC potently
suppressed FC101-induced loss of cell viability in the cells
(Fig. 2C-2F). Taken together, the findings indicate that
FC101 induces cytotoxicity primarily through induction of
ROS, which can be prevented by the ROS scavenger NAC.

FC101 activates JNK by induction of ROS
Since MAPKs play a crucial role in ROS-induced
cell death [29–31], we next investigated whether FC101induced cell death is associated with activation of Erk1/2,
p38 and JNK. As shown in Fig. 3A, treatment with FC101
for 24 h did not obviously alter the phosphorylation of
Erk1/2 and p38, but induced the phosphorylation of JNK
in a concentration-dependent manner in COS7 cells.
Noticeably, FC101 activation of JNK also resulted in
a robust phosphorylation of c-Jun, a substrate of JNK
(Fig. 3A). Furthermore, pretreatment with NAC (5 mM)
for 1 h blocked FC101-induced phosphorylation of JNK
and c-Jun in the cells (Fig. 3B). The results suggest that
FC101 activates JNK pathway by induction of ROS.
To determine the role of JNK in FC101-induced
cytotoxicity, COS7 cells were pretreated with or without
SP600125 (JNK inhibitor) for 30 min, and then exposed
to FC101 for 24 h. As shown in Fig. 3C, pretreatment
with SP600125 (0.5–2.5 μM) profoundly blocked FC101induced phosphorylation of c-Jun, as the surrogate of JNK
activity. As the JNK inhibitor was able to inhibit JNK/cJun phosphorylation induced by FC101, we next examined
whether the JNK inhibitor attenuates FC101-induced
cytotoxicity. For this, COS7 cells were pretreated with or
without SP600125 for 30 min, followed by exposure to
FC101 (0.5 or 1 μM) for 24 h. As shown in Fig. 3D and 3E,
0.5–2.5 μM of SP600125 itself did not obviously influence
the basal cell viability, but significantly prevented
FC101 from reducing cell viability. Similar results
were also seen in the HEK 293 cells (data not shown).
In addition, we further confirmed the above finding by
genetic manipulation. Infection of COS7 with Ad-dn-cJun resulted in expression of FLAG-tagged dominant
negative c-Jun (dn-c-Jun), as detected by Western blotting
with antibodies to FLAG (Fig. 3F). Expression of the
dn-c-Jun attenuated FC101-reduced cell viability in COS7

RESULTS
FC101 reduces cell viability by induction of ROS
To determine whether FC101-induced cytotoxicity
is related to induction of ROS, COS7 and HEK293 cells
were treated with FC101 (0–5 μM) for 24 h, followed by
assays for cell viability and ROS induction. As shown
in Fig. 1A, treatment with FC101 for 24 h resulted in a

cells (Fig. 3G). Collectively, our data indicate that FC101induced cytotoxicity in COS7 and HEK 293 cells is at
least in part via activating JNK pathway.

Since FC101-induced ROS activated the JNK
pathway (Fig. 3), we next wondered whether FC101
inhibition of PP2A/PP5 is associated with induction
of ROS. For this, COS7 cells were pretreated with or
without NAC for 1 h, and then exposed to FC101 for 24 h.
By Western blot analysis, we found that NAC potently
blocked FC101-induced demethylated- and phosphoPP2A, and prevented FC101-induced down-regulation of
PP2A-A and PP5 in the cells (Fig. 4B). Similar data were
seen in the HEK293 cells (data not shown). Our findings
imply that FC101-induced ROS might inhibit PP2A and
PP5, resulting in activation of JNK.

FC101 induction of ROS inhibits PP2A and PP5
It has been demonstrated that MKP-1 and PP2A
negatively regulate Erk1/2, JNK and/or p38, whereas
PP1 and PP5 negatively regulate JNK/p38 [29, 30,
34–38]. In the present study, since FC101 was found to
induce activation of JNK, but not Erk1/2 and p38 MAPK
(Fig. 3A), we deduced that MKP-1 and PP1 were not
inhibited by FC101. Therefore, we reasoned that FC101
might activate the JNK pathway by inhibiting PP2A and/or
PP5. To this end, COS7 cells were exposed to 0–5 μM of
FC101 for 24 h, followed by Western blotting. As shown
in Fig. 4A, FC101 did not apparently alter the cellular
protein level of the catalytic subunit PP2Ac, but increased
the expression of demethylated- and phospho-PP2Ac,
two events related to inhibition of PP2A activity [39],
concentration-dependently. Also, FC101 did not affect the
expression of PP2A-B, but reduced the protein levels of
PP2A-A and PP5 in a concentration dependent manner
(Fig. 4A). The results suggest that FC101 inhibits PP2A
and PP5.

Overexpression of PP2A and PP5 partially
prevents FC101-induced JNK activation
and cell death
To verify the significance of PP2A and PP5 in
FC101-induced activation of JNK and cell death, we
further studied whether overexpression of PP2A or PP5
impacts FC101 in activation of JNK and cytotoxicity.
For this, COS7 cells, infected with Ad-PP2A,
Ad-PP5 or Ad-GFP (as control), were exposed to
FC101 (0.5 and 1 μM) for 24 h, followed by Western
blotting, morphological analysis and cell viability assay.

We observed that overexpression of PP2A remarkably
attenuated FC101-induced activation of JNK (Fig. 5A)
as well as cell cytotoxicity (Fig. 5B and 5C). Similarly,
overexpression of PP5 also potently prevented FC101induced cell cytotoxicity by inactivating JNK (Fig. 6A-6C).
Together, our results support the notion that FC101
induces cytotoxicity at least in part by inhibiting PP2A
and PP5, leading to activation of JNK pathway.

a slightly different sensitivity to FC101 (Fig. 1).
Interestingly, the cell viability reduction by FC101
was closely related to the level of ROS induced. More
importantly, NAC, a ROS scavenger, was able to almost
completely block FC101-induced cell death (Fig. 2).
Therefore, our data strongly support the notion that
FC101, like many other mycotoxins mentioned above,
induces cell death predominantly by induction of ROS.
Here we found that FC101-induced ROS activated
JNK cascade, leading to cell death in HEK293 and
COS7 cells, which is, to some extent, different from the
findings in other mycotoxins [44–46]. For instance, it
has been shown that satratoxin H, a mycotoxin, induces
apoptosis of PC12 cells through the activation of JNK
and p38 MAPK due to ROS induction [44]. Similarly,
aflatoxin G1-induced ROS triggers apoptosis in A549
cells by activating JNK and p38 pathways [45]. Exposure
to T-2 toxin induces ROS and the phosphorylation of
Erk1/2, p38 MAPK and JNK, causing apoptosis in human
neuroblastoma cells (IMR-32) [46]. Therefore, the above
findings indicate that many mycotoxins can induce cell
death by induction of ROS, but the signaling pathways
targeted apparently differ from case to case.
In the present study, we provide evidence that
FC101-induced cell death is due to ROS-mediated
inhibition of PP2A and PP5, leading to activation of JNK
cascade. This is supported by the following observations.
Firstly, FC101 induced ROS, leading to cytotoxicity of
COS7 and HEK293 cells. This process could be almost
completely prevented by NAC (Fig. 2), a ROS scavenger,
indicating that the induction of ROS contributes to
FC101-induced cytotoxicity. Secondly, FC101 induced
activation of JNK, but not Erk1/2 and p38, resulting in the
cytotoxicity, which was markedly attenuated by SP600125
(JNK inhibitor) or by expression of dominant negative
c-Jun (Fig. 3). This suggests that among the MAPKs, only

DISCUSSION
Reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated
from both endogenous and exogenous insults play a
critical role in the toxic injury process of cells [27, 42].
Recent studies have demonstrated that the toxicity of a
variety of mycotoxins, such as zearalenone, T-2 toxin,
ochratoxin  A, fumonisin B1, aflatoxin B, and patulin,
is related to induction of ROS in various types of cells
[17–26]. FC101 is a toxic fungal metabolite mainly
produced by F. equiseti [12], which has been observed
frequently in human food and animal feedstuffs [1–4, 43].
Although it has been shown that FC101 induces cell death
[11–16], the underlying molecular mechanism is still
poorly understood. Here we demonstrate that FC101
induces ROS, causing the activation of the stress kinase
JNK cascade, leading to cell death. Our findings suggest
that the toxicity of FC101 in humans and animals may be
prevented and treated by pharmacological interventions,
such as antioxidants and JNK inhibitors.
Recently, it has been observed that FC101 increases
the level of hydrogen peroxide, a kind of ROS, in
glioblastoma cells (A172) [14]. However, whether the
induction of hydrogen peroxide contributes to the cell
death is not known. In the present study, we found that
FC101 increased the levels of ROS in both COS7 and
HEK293 cells, although the two cell lines exhibited

JNK is involved in FC101-induced cytotoxicity. Thirdly,
activation of the JNK signaling by FC101 was remarkably
inhibited by NAC (Fig. 3), revealing that FC101 activation
of JNK is related to its induction of ROS. Fourthly,
FC101-induced ROS obviously increased the expression
of demethylated- and phospho-PP2Ac (Fig. 4), two events
related to inhibition of PP2A [39], and reduced the protein
level of PP5 (Fig. 4), directly related to inhibition of PP5.
Furthermore, FC101-induced ROS also decreased the
protein level of PP2A-A (Fig. 4), a regulatory subunit
shared by both PP2A and PP5 [34, 39], indicating
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

inhibition of both PP2A and PP5. Lastly, overexpression of
PP2A or PP5 prevented FC101-induced activation of JNK
as well as cell death (Fig. 5 and 6). To our knowledge, this
is the first study to unveil how FC101 induces cell death
by mediating PP2A/PP5-JNK signaling pathway.
However, at this stage, we do not know how
FC101 induction of ROS increases the expression of
demethylated-PP2Ac and phospho-PP2Ac (Tyr307),
leading to inhibition of PP2A activity. PP2Ac is
uniquely methylated on Leu309 by the leucine carboxyl
methyltransferase-1 (LCMT-1) [47, 48], and demethylated

by protein phosphatase methylesterase-1 (PME-1) [49].
Besides, the phosphorylation of PP2Ac on Tyr307 can
be triggered by activation of SRC kinase or epidermal
growth factor receptor (EGFR), and be eliminated by
protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B) [50]. Further
studying the effects of FC101 on the activity of LCMT-1,
PME-1, SRC, EGFR and/or PTP1B may clarify how
PP2A is inhibited by FC101-induced ROS. In addition,
currently we have no clue as to how PP5 protein level
was downregulated by FC101-induced ROS. It has been
reported that cadmium-induced ROS or hydrogen peroxide

www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

can also downregulate PP5 protein expression in neuronal
cells [29, 30]. These findings suggest that oxidative stressinduced downregulation of PP5 protein level may be a
general feature. Identifying how PP5 is downregulated
by ROS may be helpful for design of new interventions
against oxidative stress-induced cytotoxicity or diseases.
A new question arising from the current study is
how FC101 increases the level of ROS in the cells. Given
that the level of ROS in a cell is tightly regulated by the
ROS generation system and the ROS clearance system
[51], it would be interesting to determine whether the

42329

elevated level of ROS is attributed to increased generation
of ROS by activating NADPH oxidases and/or decreased
clearance of ROS by inhibiting superoxide dismutase or
catalase in the cells. The new data may be instructive for
the development of more effective strategy against the
toxicity of FC101 clinically in humans and animals.
In summary, here we show that FC101-inducd cell
death was attributed to the induction of ROS in COS7
and HEK293 cells. Mechanistically, FC101-induced ROS
was able to suppress the activity of PP2A and PP5, which
resulted in activation of the stress kinase JNK, thereby
leading to cell death. Our findings shed a new insight on
the molecular mechanism of FC101’s cytotoxicity.

previously [52, 53]. For experiments, cells were grown
in the growth medium and infected with individual
adenovirus for 24 h at 5 of multiplicity of infection
(MOI = 5). Subsequently, cells were used for experiments.
Ad-GFP served as a control. Overexpression of FLAGtagged dn-c-Jun or wt-PP2A and HA-tagged wt-PP5 was
confirmed by Western blotting with antibodies to FLAG
and HA, respectively.

Cell viability assay
Cell viability was evaluated using CellTiter
96® AQueous One Solution Cell Proliferation Assay kit
(Promega), as described [16]. Briefly, cells suspended
in the growth medium were seeded in a 96-well plate at
a density of 1 × 104 cells/well (in triplicates) and were
grown overnight at 37°C in a humidified incubator with
5% CO2. The next day, cells were treated with FC101
(0–5  μM) for 24 h or with/without FC101 (0.5 μM)
following pre-incubation with JNK inhibitor SP600125
(0.5, 1 and 2.5 μM) for 30 min, respectively. Additionally,
cells, infected with Ad-GFP, Ad-c-Jun, Ad-PP2A and
Ad-PP5, respectively, were exposed to FC101 (0–1 μM).
After incubation for 24 h, each well was added with 20 μL
of one solution reagent and was incubated for 1 h. Cell
viability was determined by measuring the optical density
(OD) at 490 nm using a Wallac 1420 Multilabel Counter
(PerkinElmer Life Sciences, Wellesley, MA).

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Materials
Fusarochromanone (FC101) was isolated and
purified (purity >97%, by NMR) from rice cultures of the
fungus F. equiseti, and was converted into the stable and
water-soluble phosphate-salt form, as described [12].
The phosphate-salt form of FC101 was then dissolved in
Milli-Q water and filtered through a 0.2 μm syringe filter
to prepare a sterile stock solution (5 mM), aliquoted and
stored at −20°C. Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium
(DMEM), MEM non-essential amino acids and 0.05%
trypsin-EDTA were obtained from Mediatech (Herndon,
VA), fetal bovine serum (FBS) from Atlanta Biologicals
(Lawrenceville, GA), enhanced chemiluminescence
solution from Perkin-Elmer Life Science (Boston, MA),
CellTiter 96® AQueous One Solution Cell Proliferation
Assay kit from Promega (Madison, WI), SP600125
from LC Laboratories (Woburn, MA), 5-(and-6)chloromethyl-2′,7′-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate
(CM-H2DCFDA) from Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA).

Cell morphological analysis
Cells were seeded at a density of 2 × 105 cells/
well in a 6-well plate. The next day, cells were treated
with FC101 (0–1 μM), following pre-incubation with/
without SP600125 (1 μM) for 30 min. In some cases,
after infection with Ad-PP2A, Ad-PP5 and Ad-GFP,
respectively, cells were exposed to FC101 (0–1 μM)
for 24 h. Additionally, cells were seeded at a density of
2 × 104 cells/well in a 6-well plate. The next day, the cells
were exposed to FC101 (0–1 μM) for 4–6 days following
pretreatment with or without NAC (5 mM) for 1 h. Finally,
images were taken with an Olympus inverted phasecontrast microscope equipped with the Quick Imaging
system.

Cell lines and cultures
Both African green monkey kidney fibroblast-like
cells (COS7) and human embryonic kidney 293 cells
(HEK293) were purchased from American Type Culture
Collection (Manassas, VA), and were grown in antibioticfree DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% MEM
non-essential amino acids. All cells were cultured in a
humid incubator (37°C and 5% CO2).

ROS detection
The ROS level was measured by using CMH2DCFDA, as described [54]. Briefly, cells were seeded
at a density of 1 × 104 cells/well in 96-well plates. The
next day, cells were loaded with 10 μM CM-H2DCFDA
following the manufacturer’s protocol, and were incubated
in the presence of FC101 (0–5 μM) for 24 h with triplicates
of each treatment. In some cases, after loading with 10 μM
CM-H2DCFDA for 40 min, cells were pre-incubated with
