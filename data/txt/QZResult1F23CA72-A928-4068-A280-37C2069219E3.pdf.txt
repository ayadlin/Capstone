Interactions with Circulating Tumor Cells

Abstract
Although circulating neutrophils are associated with distant metastasis and poor outcome in a number of
epithelial malignancies, it remains unclear whether neutrophils play an active causal role in the metastatic
cascade. Using in vivo models of metastasis, we found that neutrophils promote cancer cell adhesion within liver
sinusoids and, thereby, inﬂuence metastasis. Neutrophil depletion before cancer cell inoculation resulted in a
decreased number of gross metastases in an intrasplenic model of liver metastasis. This effect was reversed when
inﬂamed neutrophils were co-inoculated with cancer cells. In addition, early adhesion within liver sinusoids was
inhibited in the absence of neutrophils and partially restored with a short perfusion of isolated activated
neutrophils. Intravital microscopy showed that cancer cells adhered directly on top of arrested neutrophils,
indicating that neutrophils may act as a bridge to facilitate interactions between cancer cells and the liver
parenchyma. The adhesion of lipopolysaccharide-activated neutrophils to cancer cells was mediated by
neutrophil Mac-1/ICAM-1. Our ﬁndings, therefore, show a novel role for neutrophils in the early adhesive steps
of liver metastasis. Cancer Res; 72(16); 3919–27. 2012 AACR.

Introduction
A growing body of literature links metastasis and inﬂammation (1, 2). Cancer is an inﬂammatory condition and the
available treatments are associated with an acute inﬂammatory state, be it through tissue trauma, infectious complications, or tumor-mediated inﬂammation (3). A portion of this
literature has focused on the clinical observation that elevated
neutrophil counts or elevated neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratios
are predictive of poor outcomes and distant metastasis in
patients with a wide array of epithelial malignancies including
lung (4), gastric (5), ovarian (6), hepatic (6), pancreatic (7), and
colon carcinomas (8). Neutrophils become activated in
response to inﬂammatory stimuli and have widespread effects
on organs that commonly harbor metastases such as the lung
and the liver (9). The growing literature on neutrophilia in the
perioperative period and, more speciﬁcally, in the pretreatment setting indicates that it is associated with poor oncologic
outcomes. Inﬂammation arising from the primary tumor or

from treatment-associated complications affect neutrophil
function and numbers and may be related to cancer progression (3). Thus, an improved understanding of how neutrophils
may participate in the metastatic cascade could provide new
insight for patients who are eligible to receive therapies with
curative intent.
Patients with developing carcinomas shed circulating tumor
cells (CTC) that ultimately are the seeds of distant metastasis
(1, 10). Malignancies with poor outcomes are generally related
to early implantation of CTCs within metastatic sites. CTCs
can adhere directly to the endothelium of a target organ such
as the liver (11). Inﬂammatory stimuli including tumor-derived
cytokines or complications of treatments such as infections
can cause an upregulation of inﬂammation-inducible cell
adhesion molecules (CAM) that promote the adhesion and
recruitment of CTCs to a host organ (12). Neutrophils promote
endothelial dysfunction and can directly cause changes in CAM
expression of endothelial cells (13). Thus, there is reason to
believe that patients with developing carcinomas causing a
systemic inﬂammatory state may experience neutrophil
recruitment to potential host organs that facilitates the
implantation of CTCs by both direct and indirect action.
Indeed, there is now increasing in vitro evidence that supports
the possibility of such CTC–neutrophil interactions (14–21).
Very limited data are available for the presence of a functional
role of neutrophils in the process of CTC recruitment to
metastatic sites in vivo and the mechanistic basis of such
interactions have yet to be characterized in animal models
(22). This was the primary goal of our study.
Neutrophils experience changes in their surface CAMs that
affect their adherence and migratory abilities within putative
host metastatic tissues as a result of inﬂammatory cues (23).

One such molecule is Mac-1 (CD11b, aMb2). It is the a-subunit
of the predominant b2 (CD18) integrin present on granulocytes
(24). Mac-1 becomes highly expressed on the surface of neutrophils in response to inﬂammatory cues such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS), an endotoxin produced by Gram-negative
bacteria (25). We have previously shown that systemic inﬂammation via LPS promotes cancer cell adhesion within the liver
using intravital microscopy (11). One of its main binding
partners is ICAM-1, which is expressed on endothelial cells
as well as a number of human and mouse lung cancer cells. It is,
therefore, plausible that ICAM-1–expressing CTCs may interact with neutrophil Mac-1 within the microcirculation of a host
metastatic organ.
As an example, patients requiring operative resection for
non–small cell carcinoma of the lung are subject to important
tissue trauma and are at high risk for infectious complications
during the postoperative period (26). The tissue manipulation
required during surgery is associated with an important release
of CTCs (27–29). Together, the combination of acute systemic
inﬂammatory stimuli with high numbers of CTCs presents a
fertile ground for the initiation of metastasis (3). The clinical
evidence linking postoperative complications and high CTC
numbers to poor oncologic outcomes is abundant (30–34).
This study contends that neutrophils, as key effectors of the
acute systemic inﬂammatory reaction, play a functional role to
promote the implantation of CTCs and, thus, facilitate metastatic spread to distant organs such as the liver.

Materials and Methods
Animals and cell lines
Six-week-old C57BL6 mice (Charles River, St. Constant,
Quebec) weighing approximately 25 g were maintained in the
Royal Victoria Hospital Animal Facility and used for all the
experiments, with the exception of the experiments conducted
on the spinning-disc confocal microscope, for which mice were
housed at the Institute for Infection, Immunity and Inﬂammation in Calgary, Alberta. Lysm-enhanced GFP mice, in which
the enhanced GFP gene was knocked into the murine lysozyme
M locus, were used to identify PMN/cancer cell interactions in
vivo (35, 36). Mac-1–null Itgam/ mice were used to study the
effect of Mac-1 on PMN/cancer cell interactions in vivo using
intravital microscopy (37). The Itgam/ mice have a targeted
disruption of the CD11b locus that prevents formation of the
b2-integrin Mac-1 by preventing the heterodimerization of
CD11b and CD18. All experiments were conducted in accordance with guidelines prescribed by the institutional animal
care committee.
Lewis lung carcinoma H-59 cells that stably express GFP
after plasmid transfection (a kind gift from Dr. Pnina Brodt)
were obtained and cultured as previously described (38). They
have been tested and authenticated in accordance with our
institutional policies for contaminants using PCR within the
past year. Near-conﬂuent monolayers of H-59 cells were
detached using a PBS-EDTA solution and resuspended in PBS
for injection. In some cases, untransfected H-59 cells were used
and could be labeled using cell tracker orange (Invitrogen,
Molecular Probes). A549 human lung carcinoma cells that were
obtained within the past 6 months from the American Type

Culture Collection were handled as previously described to
conduct adhesion assays with isolated human neutrophils.
ICAM-1 expression has previously been established in this cell
line (39). Circulating neutrophils were isolated on a Ficollhypaque gradient (VWR) from anesthetized C57BL6 mice after
cardiac puncture using a heparinized syringe as previously
described. Neutrophil isolates were 98% viable when assessed
by trypan blue exclusion. In some experiments, neutrophils
were treated with LPS (Sigma) 100 ng/mL for 45 minutes
in vitro.
Liver metastasis model
Intrasplenic injections for the study of gross metastasis
formation were conducted as previously described (40). Brieﬂy,
C57BL6 mice were anesthetized and their spleens were
injected with 105 H-59-GFP cells in PBS and euthanized at
72 hours and 2 weeks later. Surface metastases were counted
under a stereomicroscope at 2 weeks, whereas microscopic
metastases were counted using a 10 objective on a Nikon
Eclipse TE300 microscope over 20 liver sections per mouse
with 5 mice per group. For mice with innumerable metastases,
the total number was capped at 200. Some mice were depleted
of PMNs by intraperitoneal injection of PMN-depleting antibodies (RB6-8C5 150 mg i.v.; Cedarlane; ref. 41) and some PMNdepleted animals received H-59-GFP cells that were coincubated with LPS-treated (LPS 100 ng/mL for 45 minutes) mouse
PMNs for 1 hour.
Intravital microscopy of the liver
Mice were prepared for hepatic intravital microscopy and
received intra-arterial injections of H-59 cells. Brieﬂy, quantiﬁcation of H-59 cell recruitment to the liver was done with
direct in vivo visualization of the hepatic microvasculature
under epiﬂuorescence on a Nikon Eclipse TE300 microscope
(Nikon) equipped with a 20 objective and a video camera
(Panasonic Digital KR222, Panasonic). Images were recorded
on an iMac G5 (Apple, Cupertino, CA) equipped with videoacquisition software. Some experiments were conducted on a
spinning-disc confocal Olympus IX81 inverted microscope
using an 10/0.40 Uplan FL N objective to visualize PMN/
H-59-GFP interactions in vivo. The microscope was equipped
with a confocal light path (WaveFX, Quorum) on the basis of a
modiﬁed Yokogawa CSU-10 head (Yokogawa Electric Corporation, Tokyo, Japan). Some animals received the anti-GR-1
mAb conjugated to Alexa-568 (1.6 mg intra-arterially; eBiosciences) to label PMNs in vivo. For some experiments, the GR-1
label was conjugated to Alexa Fluor 647 and, for others, Alexa
Fluor 555. Some mice received bacterial LPS i.v. (0.5 mg/kg) as
a model of acute inﬂammation and others received RB6-8C5
150 mg i.p. for PMN depletion. Isolated PMNs were stimulated
with LPS 100 ng/mL for 45 minutes and 2  105 PMNs were
injected per mouse 10 minutes before H-59 cell infusion.
In each experiment, 1.5  106 H-59-GFP cells were injected
intra-arterially via a carotid artery cannula. The livers were
visualized at 30, 45, and 60 minutes postinjection. Cells that
arrested within un-occluded sinusoids of the liver for greater
than 30 seconds were considered adherent, and were counted
per microscopic ﬁeld over 6 ﬁelds of view at 20 magniﬁcation

Neutrophil/Tumor Cell Adhesion Promotes Metastasis

Immunohistochemistry
To investigate the colocalization of GFP-expressing H-59
cells and neutrophils, liver specimens of mice previously used
for intravital microscopy were ﬁxed in 4% paraformaldehyde
and immersed in 30% sucrose before freezing at 80 C. Specimens were embedded in OCT compound, and frozen sections
were cut at 10 mm and immunostained with a rat anti-mouse
neutrophil speciﬁc antibody (L8993AP; Cedarlane) followed by
Alexa 568-conjugated goat anti-rat (Invitrogen). Sections were
observed under a laser-scanning confocal microscope (Zeiss).
The degree of colocalization was measured in control, LPStreated, and PMN-depleted mice by counting the percentage of
cancer cells with an associated neutrophil per ﬁeld of view in 5
random ﬁelds for 3 separate animals.
Cell adhesion assays
To determine the effect of neutrophils on the ability of H-59
cells to adhere to endothelial cells, human umbilical vein
endothelial cells (HUVEC; Cell Systems Corp.) were grown to
conﬂuence in 48-well plates and pretreated with isolated
mouse PMN (RPMI, control PMN, or LPS-activated PMN) for
3 hours before H-59-GFP co-culture with HUVECs. In other
experiments, H-59-GFP cells were coincubated with isolated
mouse PMN (RPMI, control PMN, or LPS-activated PMN) for 1
hour in a shaking water bath at 37 C before co-culture with
HUVECs. Preincubated H-59-GFP cells or coincubated PMN/
H-59-GFP cells were plated onto HUVECs for 1 hour and
counted at 20 magniﬁcation over 10 ﬁelds. Each experiment
was repeated with similar results at least 3 times.
The role of Mac-1 in PMN–H-59 cell interactions was studied
by plating H-59 cells to conﬂuence on 48-well plates. CFSE
(Molecular Probes, Invitrogen)-stained isolated mouse PMNs,
LPS-treated (100 ng/mL for 45 minutes) or otherwise, were cocultured for 1 hour in the presence of antibodies to Mac-1
(Cedarlane), ICAM-1 (Cedarlane), and CD44 (BD Pharmingen).
After 2 washes in PBS, the remaining PMNs were counted at
20 magniﬁcation over 10 ﬁelds of view.
Statistics
A Mann–Whitney U test was used to determine the significance between populations for the gross metastasis experiment. A chi-square test was used to analyze differences
between groups in the 72-hour microscopic metastasis experiment. Otherwise, ANOVA was used with a post hoc Bonferroni
correction for multiple comparisons and data are presented as
mean  SEM. Statistical signiﬁcance was set at P < 0.05.
GraphPad Prism 5 software was used for all statistical analysis
and graphing.

sinusoids is a necessary precursor to further growth and the
development of metastasis. We have previously shown that
metastatic ability of Lewis lung cancer clones closely correlates
with adhesion to hepatic sinusoids (11). We sought to determine whether the presence of neutrophils in the liver microcirculation could affect the eventual development of gross
metastasis. Intrasplenic injection of H-59 cells followed by a
2-week incubation period produces signiﬁcant numbers of
metastatic nodules. Mice depleted of circulating neutrophils,
using the anti-GR-1 antibody clone RB6-8C5, 24 hours before
intrasplenic injection reduced gross metastatic foci from a
median of 45 (n ¼ 14) in control mice to 4 (P ¼ 0.007; n ¼
13; Fig. 1). To conﬁrm that neutrophils were capable of
promoting metastatic outgrowth as a result of early interactions, neutrophils were isolated from the blood of untreated
syngeneic mice, activated with LPS and incubated for 1 hour
with H-59 cells before intrasplenic injection in neutrophildepleted mice. This treatment reversed the effects of neutrophil depletion resulting in a median number of metastases of
71.5 (P ¼ 0.047; n ¼ 6).
To address the possibility that the microscopic tumor
burden differed from what was seen in Fig. 1 in terms of
gross metastatic burden, we repeated the experiment and
counted microscopic tumor foci at 72 hours postinoculation.
In this experiment, we observed 9 tumor foci in the control
group compared with 3 in the neutrophil-depleted group
over 100 observations (P ¼ 0.037; n ¼ 5). The neutrophil
depleted with LPS-activated neutrophil reinfusion group had
8 tumor foci over 100 observations in 5 mice (P ¼ 0.061
compared with the PMN-depleted group and P ¼ 0.399
compared with control).

Intravital microscopy reveals that neutrophil depletion
reduces lung cancer cell adhesion at early time points in
the metastatic cascade
Acute systemic inﬂammation via LPS increases H-59 cell
adhesion to hepatic sinusoids (Control 14.1  0.4 vs. LPS 22
 0.84 cells/HPF; P < 0.0001) and this phenomenon is
reversed by neutrophil depletion (Fig. 2). Similar to the
intrasplenic model, neutrophil depletion resulted in a signiﬁcant decrease in H-59 cell adhesion within 1 hour of
injection (Control 14.1  0.4 vs. PMN-depleted 11.7  0.52
cells/HPF; P < 0.01). This effect was most prominent in the
acutely inﬂamed host (LPS 22  0.84 vs. LPS and PMN
depletion 8.9  0.4 cells/HPF; P < 0.0001). To conﬁrm that
activated neutrophils alone were capable of promoting
metastasis, we isolated peripheral blood neutrophils from
syngeneic sibling mice, treated them with LPS and, after
washing, injected them into mice prepared for intravital
microscopy. When neutrophil-depleted mice received LPSactivated peripheral blood neutrophils 10 minutes before H59 injection, hepatic adhesion of H-59 cells was signiﬁcantly
increased from a mean of 11.6  0.40 to 16.5  0.53 cells/HPF
(Fig. 2). This treatment partially restored the metastatic
recruitment observed from the systemically inﬂamed mice
that received intravenous LPS 4 hours before H-59 injection
(22.0  0.84 cells/HPF).

Intravital microscopy shows lung cancer cells directly
interacting with arrested neutrophils in vivo
The results of the previous experiments indicated that
neutrophils prime the microenvironment for the arrival of
CTCs in such a way that their adhesion and outgrowth is
facilitated. We, therefore, used the higher resolution of spinning-disc confocal microscopy to image the in vivo interactions
between CTCs and native neutrophils within the liver. Mice
were prepared for intravital microscopy and injected with antiGR-1 ﬂuorescently conjugated antibody to highlight circulating
neutrophils. Following this preparation, GFP-tagged H-59 cells
were injected via a carotid cannula, as previously described.
Within minutes, we identiﬁed direct physical interactions
between arrested neutrophils and infused GFP-tagged H-59
cells in hepatic sinusoids. The time series presented shows the
arrival and arrest of an H-59 cell directly over a GR-1–labeled
PMN (Arrow, Fig. 3A and 3B and Supplementary Movie). This
cancer cell remained adherent for the entire imaging period,
while another H-59 cell that was not associated with a neutrophil did not remain stably adhered (arrowhead, Fig. 3C and
D). In addition, a circulating neutrophil was noted to be
patrolling through the sinusoid containing the H-59–PMN
complex even at 45-minute postadhesion, indicating that this
sinusoid remained patent (arrow, Fig. 3E and F).
Neutrophils frequently colocalize with arrested lung
cancer cells in vivo in both inﬂamed and baseline
conditions
Given the ﬁnding that neutrophils can be physically linked to
the arrest of CTCs and that their absence leads to reduced
metastatic burden, we investigated how frequently such colocalization occurred during the early phases of metastasis
within liver sinusoids. The livers of mice having undergone
intravital microscopy to assess cancer cell adhesion under
control, LPS-inﬂamed, and neutrophil-depleted conditions
were frozen and sectioned for immunoﬂuorescence using a
mouse neutrophil-speciﬁc antibody. The percentage of H-59
cells that were colocalized was high in both control (82.5%) and
LPS-inﬂamed (77.6%) conditions and, as expected, was nil in
the neutrophil-depleted mouse (Fig. 4A).
To further conﬁrm this ﬁnding, the Lysm-enhanced GFP
transgenic mouse model was used to identify neutrophil–CTC
interactions. Cell tracker orange–stained H-59 cells were
injected via the carotid artery and visualized within liver
sinusoids during the ﬁrst hour postinjection by spinning-disc
confocal microscopy. Circulating neutrophils express GFP in
the Lysm-GFP mouse and these were also found to frequently
colocalize with arrested H-59 cells (Fig. 4B).
Neutrophils promote adhesion of lung cancer cells to
cultured endothelial cells
Neutrophils have multiple functions during the process of
inﬂammation and can act via multiple mechanisms. Our goal
was to determine whether neutrophils could facilitate the
adhesion of cancer cells to cultured endothelial cells. Neutrophils were isolated from the peripheral blood of C57Bl6
mice under control or LPS-activated conditions. Both uninﬂamed (40.5  2.64 cells/HPF) and LPS-activated (46.9 

were tested for their expression of ICAM-1 using ﬂow cytometry to determine whether Mac-1 based binding would be
possible and, indeed, they expressed ICAM-1 constitutively at
their surface (Supplementary Fig. S2). When PMNs were added
to H-59 monolayers in the presence of Mac-1 or ICAM-1
function-blocking antibodies, there was a signiﬁcant reduction
when PMNs were LPS activated, but not under control conditions (Fig. 5A). CD44 is a known PMN-CAM expressed at their
surface. A function-blocking CD44 antibody of the same isotype as the Mac-1 and ICAM-1 antibodies used did not lead to a
signiﬁcant decrease in PMN adhesion both under control and
LPS-activated conditions.
The same experiment was repeated, this time using the
human lung carcinoma cell line A549 and human neutrophils.
Almost identical trends were found. LPS caused a signiﬁcant
increase in neutrophil adhesion to A549 monolayers compared
with control (2.67  0.34 vs. 4.8  0.56 PMN/HPF; P < 0.05).
Both Mac-1 and ICAM-1 blockade cause signiﬁcant reductions

3.78 cells/HPF) neutrophils contributed to a signiﬁcant
increase (P < 0.0001) in adhesion of H-59 cells when added to
conﬂuent monolayers of endothelial cells for 3 hours before the
addition of cancer cells as compared with neutrophil-free
buffer (27.8  2.67 cells/HPF) In a similar fashion, co-incubation of cancer cells with PMNs for 1 hour before co-culture with
HUVECs resulted in a signiﬁcant increase in H-59 adhesion
whether PMNs were pretreated with LPS (13.3  1.41
cells/HPF) or not (17.8  1.24 cells/HPF) compared with
control buffer (6.05  0.78; P < 0.0001; Supplementary Fig. S1).
Neutrophil activation with LPS promotes adhesion to
human and murine lung cancer cells in vitro and this
effect is partially reversed by Mac-1 or ICAM-1 blockade
Initially, we determined that neutrophils were capable of
adhering to conﬂuent H-59 monolayers (17.8  2.64 PMN/HPF)
and this adhesion was potentiated when neutrophils were LPSactivated (75.9  6.14 PMN/HPF; P < 0.0001; Fig. 5A). H-59 cells

Discussion
The link between cancer progression and inﬂammation is
now well established (1). Numerous lines of investigation have
shown that inﬂammatory cells are key participants in cancer
progression and metastasis (42). This study is, to our knowledge, the ﬁrst to identify a functional role for neutrophils in the
adhesion of CTCs in the liver. Neutrophil depletion resulted in
a signiﬁcant decrease in both gross metastases using an
intrasplenic model of liver metastasis. Activated neutrophil
infusion 10 minutes before the administration of cancer cells
resulted in increased adhesion of H-59 cells in another model of
metastasis using intravital microscopy. Again at 72 hours

Figure 5. LPS promotes the adhesion of neutrophils to H-59 cells and this
effect is partially mediated by Mac-1/ICAM-1. PMNs, whether LPSactivated or not, were incubated over conﬂuent monolayers of H-59 cells

led to a signiﬁcant increase in PMN/H-59 adhesion (P < 0.0001). A,
addition of Mac-1 or ICAM-1 mAb signiﬁcantly reduced the effect of LPS.

type (WT). As expected, neutrophil recruitment to liver sinusoids after LPS stimulation in the Mac-1 KO was normal as
compared with WT controls (Fig. 6B). In terms of H-59
recruitment within the ﬁrst hour after intracarotid injection,
there was a trend toward reduced adhesion in untreated Mac-1
KO mice (3.53  0.87 cells/HPF) as compared with WT (6.22 

mice displayed a 2-fold increase in cancer cell adhesion (as
previously shown) while H-59 adhesion was unchanged in the
Mac-1 KO after LPS as compared with the Mac-1 KO-untreated
control (Fig. 6A). Furthermore, while PMN depletion in the WT
returned H-59 recruitment to control levels, it had no effect in
the Mac-1 KO, indicating that the effect seen in the Mac-1 KO is
neutrophil mediated (Fig. 6A).

Neutrophil/Tumor Cell Adhesion Promotes Metastasis

postinjection, neutrophil depletion caused a profound reduction in microscopic liver metastases, which was rescued when
activated peripheral blood neutrophils were admixed to the
cancer cell inoculum. These results indicate that early interactions between neutrophils and cancer cells within sinusoids
of the liver promote cancer progression at a key juncture in the
metastatic process.
Such interactions were documented in vivo using spinningdisc confocal intravital microscopy. Cancer cells could be seen
to arrest from ﬂow directly over an adhered neutrophil inside
liver sinusoids within minutes of cancer cell injection. Moreover, such interactions were witnessed in non-inﬂamed and
LPS-inﬂamed hosts. In fact, when quantiﬁed, the percentage
colocalization of H-59 cells and neutrophils was similar in both
control and LPS-inﬂamed mice. This ﬁnding correlates well
with the profound reduction in liver metastasis after neutrophil depletion in uninﬂamed mice. To further show that such
interactions were taking place without the potential interference of antibodies to label circulating neutrophils, the LysMGFP mouse that expresses GFP within neutrophils was used for
intravital microscopy. Once again, direct physical interactions
between GFP-tagged neutrophils and H-59 cancer cells were
identiﬁed within the ﬁrst hour after dissemination.
Nonetheless, the reduction in adhesion seen at 60 minutes
by intravital microscopy in non–LPS-stimulated conditions
was not nearly as signiﬁcant as compared with both the
reduction in micro-metastasis at 72 hours and gross metastasis
at 2 weeks after neutrophil depletion. This ﬁnding argues
against a purely adhesion-based mechanism to explain the
functional role of neutrophils in producing the dramatic effects
seen at 2 weeks. However, under LPS-stimulated conditions,
the reduction of H-59 adhesion was far more signiﬁcant after
neutrophil depletion. Furthermore, this effect appears to be
almost entirely mediated by Mac-1 as shown by intravital
microscopy using the Mac-1 KO. Together, these ﬁndings
indicate that cancer cell–neutrophil Mac-1–mediated adhesion represents a key mechanism for metastatic recruitment in
the livers of inﬂamed mice. Interestingly, the Mac-1 KO also
displayed approximately 40% less H-59 adhesion as compared
with uninﬂamed controls and this trend approached statistical
signiﬁcance. It is possible that, in the uninﬂamed setting, Mac1 continues to play a role to facilitate adhesion as a result of
mild surface expression. Nonetheless, adhesive mechanisms,
although still important, do not seem to explain the full extent
of the phenotype seen at 72 hours and 2 weeks in the uninﬂamed setting. Indeed, neutrophils may help stabilize arrested
cancer cells and may, in fact, assist their proliferation.
CTCs may use adhered neutrophils as an anchor to tether
themselves to the endothelium. Such adhered tumor cells may
beneﬁt from the matrix-degrading enzymes present within
neutrophils to extravasate into the parenchyma of the host
organ. Emerging data with regard to the angiogenic effects of
neutrophils in the tumor microenvironment are consistent
with a supportive role from the very inception of metastasis
(43, 44). Multiple cancers express chemotactic factors such as
interleukin-8 (IL-8) that recruit neutrophils to take residence
within the tumor microenvironment (45). A recent study by
Huh and colleagues showed that IL-8–expressing melanoma

www.aacrjournals.org

cells physically interact with neutrophils within hours of
inoculation (22). These interactions were b2-integrin/ICAM1 mediated and resulted in increased tumor cell retention and
transendothelial migration. IL-8 expression was directly linked
to this effect, thus indicating that the ability of cancer cells to
attract neutrophils offers a survival advantage in the metastatic environment. This study is only the second, to our
knowledge, to show physical interactions that are functionally
related to the process of early metastasis in vivo. Our results
differ from those of Huh and colleagues in that the interactions
they noted occurred after the arrest of the CTC within the lung
parenchyma. Neutrophils (endogenous and exogenously supplied) were found to have a stabilizing effect on melanoma cell
retention and proliferation. In our study, it was the presence of
neutrophils before the implantation of cancer cells that promoted the eventual implantation and outgrowth of CTCs. It is
quite likely that both mechanisms occur during these early
phases of metastasis and, in this regard, both studies are
complementary and highlight the important role of neutrophils in the metastatic cascade.
Neutrophils routinely extravasate into resident tissues to
patrol the environment where they may induce conformational
changes within the endothelium that may also facilitate the
passage of a recruited cancer cell (46). CTCs must gain access
to the host organ's parenchyma to proliferate and there is
data from in vitro studies to support the concept that neutrophils may facilitate this process (15, 16, 22). As such, CTCs
may use adhered neutrophils to "piggy-back" their way into the
parenchyma of a host organ. Additional studies examining the
nature of these interactions further into the metastatic cascade
are required to characterize the exact nature of how neutrophils might promote metastasis and, more speciﬁcally, in the
uninﬂamed setting to understand how neutrophils promote
metastasis given the limited impact of adhesion-based CTC
recruitment.
Our model aimed at eliminating neutrophils in tumor-na€ve
mice before the implantation of CTCs. The RB6-8C5 clone has
been shown to eliminate 97% of circulating neutrophils within
24 hours of administration without signiﬁcantly affecting other
populations (47). In addition, we documented this effect in Fig.
6B, where neutrophil levels were quantiﬁed by intravital
microscopy. It should be noted that, while neutrophils constitute the vast majority of circulating leukocytes targeted by GR1 depletion, other monocyte subsets numbers are mildly
affected by this mAb (48). Given the budding literature on
myeloid-derived suppressor cells and their role in the metastatic cascade, it is important to note the possibility that a
portion of our observed effects from GR-1–mediated depletion
are explained by cell populations other than neutrophils.
Nonetheless, the results from the LysM-GFP mouse do corroborate neutrophil-speciﬁc interactions with CTCs. In addition, neutrophils return to normal circulating levels within 72
hours of depletion (48). Thus, our results strongly support a
role for neutrophils during the early steps of metastasis before
the implantation of CTCs in the liver.
Although our data indicate that direct interactions between
neutrophils and cancer cells during the early phases of hematogenous metastasis are important, this study does not address

some of the other mechanisms in which neutrophils may affect
this process. It is quite likely that neutrophils alter the host
metastatic microenvironment in an indirect fashion. Neutrophils secrete large amounts of proinﬂammatory cytokines that
can activate endothelial cells, making them more likely to
capture CTCs. These cytokines could directly inﬂuence putative CTCs within the primary tumor microenvironment and/or
CTCs in circulation leading to altered CAM expression that
may affect their ability to arrest and become mature metastases. Further studies are required to understand how neutrophil products contribute to CTC implantation.
Surgery is considered deﬁnitive treatment for numerous
epithelial malignancies including lung cancer. However, the
tissue trauma of surgery itself, together with its infectious
complications such as Gram-negative sepsis, is well known
to induce neutrophilia and Mac-1 upregulation on circulating neutrophils. This, in combination with a high CTC
burden, is likely to result in poor oncologic outcomes
by promoting the adhesion of CTCs and their eventual
proliferation into gross tumors. Our results indicate that
neutrophil–lung cancer cell interactions are likely to be an
important mechanism by which the progression of early
malignancy is facilitated. More speciﬁcally, neutrophil Mac1 interactions with CTC ICAM-1 are an attractive target
requiring further investigation. Mac-1 inhibition may prove

to be a useful adjunct to limit the dissemination of CTCs in
patients undergoing potentially curative therapies for hematogenously spreading malignancies.
