ABSTRACT
Previous meta-analyses suggested that aspirin was associated with reduced risk
of endometrial cancer. However, there has been no study comprehensively summarize
the evidence of acetaminophen use and risk of endometrial cancer from observational
studies. We systematically searched electronic databases (PubMed , EMBASE, Web
of Science, and Cochrane Library) for relevant cohort or case-control studies up to
February 28, 2017. Two independent authors performed the eligibility evaluation and
data extraction. All differences were resolved by discussion. A random-effects model
was applied to estimate summary relative risks (RRs) with 95% CIs. All statistical
tests were two-sided. Seven observational studies including four prospective cohort
studies and three case-control studies with 3874 endometrial cancer cases were
included for final analysis. Compared with never use acetaminophen, ever use this
drug was not associated with risk of endometrial cancer (summarized RR = 1.02; 95%
CI: 0.93−1.13, I2 = 0%). Similar null association was also observed when compared the
highest category of frequency/duration with never use acetaminophen (summarized
RR = 0.88; 95% CI: 0.70−1.11, I2 = 15.2%). Additionally, the finding was robust in
the subgroup analyses stratified by study characteristics and adjustment for potential
confounders and risk factors. There was no evidence of publication bias by a visual
inspection of a funnel plot and formal statistical tests. In summary, the present metaanalysis reveals no association between acetaminophen use and risk of endometrial
cancer. More large scale prospective cohort studies are warranted to confirm our
findings and carry out the dose-response analysis of aforementioned association.

INTRODUCTION

pathophysiologic pathways including elevations in
cytokines, prostaglandins, and cyclooxygenase with
concomitant oxidative stress, induces rapid cell division
and DNA damage which increase the risk of malignancy
[8, 9]. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs),
such as aspirin, decreased cancer risk through inhibition
of both cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1) and COX-2 expression
and subsequent prostaglandin synthesis, enhancement
of cellular immune response, or induction of apoptosis
[10–13]. However, as the major metabolite of phenacetin,
acetaminophen (paracetamol), which does not have COX2-inhibitory properties, is also considered carcinogenic to
humans [14]. Although previous observational studies have
focused on the relationship between acetaminophen use
and EC risk [15–21], there has been no systematic review

Endometrial cancer (EC) is the six most commonly
diagnosed cancer and the second most commonly
diagnosed gynecologic cancer among females worldwide,
with an estimated 0.32 million cases in 2012 [1]. Since
previous studies have established a hypothesis that that
greater lifetime exposure to estrogens, unopposed by
progesterone, is important in the etiology of this disease
[2, 3], therefore, several hormone-related factors including
early menarche [4], late menopause [5], nulliparity [6],
and obesity [7] have been identified as risk factors for EC.
During the past decade, experimental studies
have postulated that chronic inflammation is related
to endometrial carcinogenesis through several

addition, the result of meta-regression analysis suggested

RR ranged from 1.01 (95% CI = 0.91–1.12; I2 = 0%) when

I2 = 0%), when Setiawan et al. [16] was excluded.

and meta-analysis comprehensively and quantitatively
summarize the evidence of aforementioned issue.
Therefore, to help reconcile the aforementioned issue
as well as to provide the most recent evidence, we decided
to perform the present systematic review and meta-analysis
of observational studies to investigate associations between
use of acetaminophen and the risk of EC.

RESULTS
Search results, study characteristics, and quality
assessment

Highest category (frequency/duration) versus
never use

Our initial search of PubMed, EMBASE, Web
of Science, and Cochrane Library databases returned
437 articles. After we screened titles and abstracts, 18
articles qualified for a full review (Figure 1). We finally
included seven observational studies for the present
meta-analysis [15–21].
Table 1 presents the main characteristics of the seven
included studies. These studies were published from 2002 to
2013 and involved a total of 3874 EC patients with a range
from 58 to 1398 cases in individual studies. Among these
studies, four were prospective cohort studies [16, 17, 19,
21] and other three studies were case-control studies [15,
18, 20]. Of the four prospective cohort studies, the number
of cohort participants varied from 26272 [21] to 82971
[19]. Of these three case-control studies, controls were
drawn from the general population in two studies [15, 18]
and hospitals in one study [20]. The majority of included
studies were conducted in USA (n = 5), and one each was
conducted in Australia [15] and Denmark [21]. All included
studies adjusted for body mass index, except for study
carried out by Friis et al. [21]. Five studies adjusted for age
and hormone replacement therapy. However, four and three
studies adjusted for parity and oral contraceptive use.
According to quality assessment criteria
(Supplementary Tables 1 and 2), for prospective cohort
studies, the majority of included studies met the criteria
except for study carried out by Friis et al. [21] which was
attributed to provide crude risk estimate as well as limited
follow-up time. For case-control studies, the majority
of included studies met the criteria except for study
carried out by Moysich et al. [20] which was attributed
to hospital-based controls and significant difference in the
response rate between cases and controls.

Six observational studies totaling 3816 patients
evaluated the association between acetaminophen use and
risk of EC [15–20]. We observed null association between
highest frequency/duration of acetaminophen using versus
no use and risk of EC (Summarized RR = 0.88; 95% CI:
0.70–1.11), with moderate heterogeneity (I2 = 15.2%)
(Figure 4). There was no evidence of publication bias by
a visual inspection of a funnel plot (Figure 5) and formal
statistical tests (Egger test, P = 0.70; Begg test, P = 0.85).
Negative findings were observed throughout the
subgroup analyses by study characteristics and adjustment
for potential confounders and risk factors (Table 3).
Although the result of meta-regression analysis suggested
no evidence of significant heterogeneity between subgroups,
we still observed moderate heterogeneity in several
subgroups. Sensitivity analysis was performed by excluding
one study at a time showed that the summarized RR ranged
from 0.95 (95% CI = 0.68–1.32; I2 = 23.5%) when Bodelon
et al. [18] was excluded, to 0.81 (95% CI =  0.66–1.00;
I2 = 0%), when Setiawan et al. [16] was excluded.

DISCUSSION
In this first meta-analysis with 3874 EC patients
and 205,186 non EC populations, we found that ever
use of acetaminophen was not associated with risk of
EC. Additionally, more frequent or longer duration of
acetaminophen use was still not associated with EC risk.
These negative findings were robust in the numerous
subgroup and sensitivity analyses.
Although there have been increasing evidence
that inflammation and the COX pathway are involved
in endometrial carcinogenesis, to some extent, the null
association between acetaminophen use and EC risk is
biologically plausible. NSAIDs act through inhibiting
prostaglandin synthesis and may prevent carcinogenesis
through COX-dependent or COX-independent mechanisms
[22–24]. COX-1 is expressed constitutively, whereas COX2 is an inducible enzyme and has been implicated in the
development of cancer [23, 25]. In vitro studies suggested a
higher COX-2 expression in EC cells compared with normal

Ever versus never use
Seven observational studies totaling 3874 EC patients
evaluated the association between acetaminophen use and risk
of EC [15–21]. We observed null association between ever use
of acetaminophen versus no use and risk of EC (Summarized
RR = 1.02; 95% CI: 0.93–1.13), without heterogeneity (I2 =
0%) (Figure 2). There was no evidence of publication bias by

endometrium [25, 26], and inhibition of EC cell growth
induced by NSAIDs [27, 28]. Of note, COX-2 selective
inhibitors have been shown in vitro to markedly inhibit
the proliferation of EC cells in a time and dose dependent
manner [27, 29]. However, recently, experimental studies
have found limited evidence of chemopreventive roles of
acetaminophen, the major metabolite of phenacetin, does
not have COX-2-inhibitory properties [14].
Experimental studies have proposed that obesity
leads to several proinflammatory processes as well as
increases the levels of circulating estrogens [30, 31].
Therefore, obesity might be a modifier between the
acetaminophen use and EC risk. However, only two
included studies carried out the subgroup analysis
stratified by body mass index. Although we observed
some variation in the direction and size of association in
the results of subgroup analysis, none of the associations
showed statistically significance. Similar patterns were
observed in the stratified analysis by menopausal hormone
use which is one of the established risk factors of EC [16].
Since the limited cases appeared in their primary subgroup
analysis, further studies with larger sample size or pooled
analysis are warranted to verify these issues.
An important strength of our study is that we first
comprehensively and quantitatively summarize the
evidence of acetaminophen use and EC risk on the basis of
observational studies so far. Furthermore, compared with
single study, the sample size of the present meta-analysis
was relatively large, allowing for a careful evaluation of
acetaminophen use. Notably, these findings were consistent
throughout the subgroup and sensitivity analyses. Despite
these strengths, several limitations merit discussion. First,

our meta-analysis included both cohort and case-control
studies. Compared with prospective cohort studies, casecontrol studies are more likely to subject to several bias
including recall and selection bias. However, the findings
of the present study were similar in subgroup analysis
stratified by study design, though significant heterogeneity
was observed in case-control studies when summarized the
association between frequency/duration of acetaminophen
use and EC risk. Second, since the majority of included
studies utilized questionnaire to collect the acetaminophen
use [15–20], misclassification of exposures might be a
concern in this study which may have biased the results
toward the null [16]. Of note, we found the category of
acetaminophen use was different among these included
studies. One study defined ‘never use’ as never use any
type of NSAIDs for more than 5 days per month for at
least 6 months [18]. In contrast, other study defined that
variable as never use acetaminophen at least 2 times a
week (for 1 month or longer) [16]. Additionally, limited
studies considered the number of brands, different doses,
and the complexity of the formulations of acetaminophen
which make it unlikely that ascertainment of use of
acetaminophen was perfectly precise [18]. Moreover, we
failed to carry out dose-response analysis to quantitate
the effect of one tablet per day of acetaminophen on EC
risk because the aforementioned phenomenon as well
as the limited available data of these included studies.
Consequently, whether there is a non-linear aforementioned
association has been still unknown. Third, although
geographic location was not the source of heterogeneity,
the point estimate was slightly different between studies
carried out in USA and outside of USA. This phenomenon

might be attributed to the different prevalence of
acetaminophen use. For example, the prevalence of
acetaminophen use was 87.8% and 88.6% in EC cases
and controls, respectively, in the Australian National
Endometrial Cancer Study (ANECS), a population-based
case-control study [15]. However, the aforementioned
prevalence was 27.1% in 32059 populations in the
prospective VITamins and Lifestyle (VITAL) study which
was carried out in western Washington State [17]. Finally,
previous studies mentioned that use of NSAIDs including
acetaminophen might be associated with body mass
index, cigarette smoking, parity, age at menarche, oral
contraceptive use, and menopausal hormone use [16, 32,
33]. Although not all potential confounders or important
risk factors were adjusted for in every study, many but
not all of the studies carried out these adjustment. In the
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

subgroup analyses stratified by these potential confounders
or important risk factors, the results of meta-regression
analyses did not show significant difference between
these findings. Furthermore, since quality scoring might
hide important information by combining disparate study
features into a single score as well as introduce an arbitrary
subjective element into the analysis, therefore, we used the
NOS instead of a scoring system.
In conclusion, after summarizing the results of four
cohorts and three case-control studies, the present systematic
review and meta-analysis failed to find any association
between ever use acetaminophen as well as more frequency
and longer duration of acetaminophen use and EC risk.
Larger prospective cohort studies are warranted to verify
our findings and carry out the dose-response analysis of
aforementioned association.

Statistical analysis
Since the low incidence of endometrial cancer, we
assumed that estimates of ORs from case-control studies
and risk ratio, or RRs from cohort studies were all valid
estimates of the RR, and therefore, we reported all results
as the RR for simplicity [6, 38–40]. For studies that did not
present results for ever use vs. never use acetaminophen,
we followed the method proposed by Hamling et al. [41] to
recalculate the RR. Briefly, Hamling et al. [41] described
a method for estimating the alternative comparisons when
summarizing published evidence potential improving the
reliability of a meta-analysis.
Random effect models were used to summarize
the risk estimates of each study. Heterogeneity among
studies was assessed with the I2 statistic which indicated
significant heterogeneity when this value greater than
50% [42]. Subgroup analyses were conducted to study
design (cohort vs. case-control studies), median number
of endometrial cancer cases (≥ 450 vs. < 450), geographic
location (USA vs. Non-USA), exposure measurement
(questionnaire vs. medication database), and adjustments
for risk factors including age, body mass index, parity,
oral contraceptive use, and hormone replacement therapy
use. Heterogeneity between subgroups was evaluated
by meta-regression. Publication bias was assessed by
inspecting a funnel plot for outcome and further tested
with Begg’s [43] and Egger’s [44] test. Additionally, to
assess the effect of individual studies on the estimated
RR, we conducted a sensitivity analysis in which we
recalculated the summarized RR by omitting one study at
a time. All statistical analyses were performed using Stata
12.0 (StataCorp LP).
