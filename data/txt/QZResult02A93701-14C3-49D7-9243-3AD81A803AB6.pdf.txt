Abstract
Peripheral neuropathy caused by cytotoxic chemotherapy, especially platins and taxanes, is a widespread
problem among cancer survivors that is likely to continue to expand in the future. However, little work to date has
focused on understanding this challenge. The goal in this study was to determine the impact of colorectal cancer
and cumulative chemotherapeutic dose on sensory function to gain mechanistic insight into the subtypes of
primary afferent ﬁbers damaged by chemotherapy. Patients with colorectal cancer underwent quantitative sensory
testing before and then prior to each cycle of oxaliplatin. These data were compared with those from 47 age- and
sex-matched healthy volunteers. Patients showed signiﬁcant subclinical deﬁcits in sensory function before any
therapy compared with healthy volunteers, and they became more pronounced in patients who received
chemotherapy. Sensory modalities that involved large Ab myelinated ﬁbers and unmyelinated C ﬁbers were most
affected by chemotherapy, whereas sensory modalities conveyed by thinly myelinated Ad ﬁbers were less sensitive
to chemotherapy. Patients with baseline sensory deﬁcits went on to develop more symptom complaints during
chemotherapy than those who had no baseline deﬁcit. Patients who were tested again 6 to 12 months after
chemotherapy presented with the most numbness and pain and also the most pronounced sensory deﬁcits. Our
results illuminate a mechanistic connection between the pattern of effects on sensory function and the nerve ﬁber
types that appear to be most vulnerable to chemotherapy-induced toxicity, with implications for how to focus
future work to ameloirate risks of peripheral neuropathy. Cancer Res; 74(21); 5955–62. 2014 AACR.

Introduction
Neuropathy induced by chemotherapy can seriously impede
successful treatment for many cancers as it often leads to
reduction or cessation of frontline treatment; and can drastically impact patients' quality of life both during and following
therapy (1). The mechanism for chemotherapy-induced
peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) is poorly understood. Primary
afferent neurons seem to be the most vulnerable as most
commonly sensory symptoms alone start in the tips of the

toes and ﬁngers and then advance over time proximally in a
"stocking-glove" distribution (2–5). More speciﬁcally, pain is
typically reported in the tips of the toes and ﬁngers; numbness
and tingling, but not necessarily pain is present in the soles of
the feet and palms; while hairy skin is typically outside the areas
of patient complaint (3, 6). Yet speciﬁc data concerning the
vulnerability of primary afferent ﬁber subtypes to toxic insult
by cancer and its treatment are not known. Here, quantitative
sensory tests (QST) were conducted in patients before and after
various cumulative doses of oxaliplatin to ﬁll this gap in
knowledge. QST is a psychophysical method used to study
human somatic sensory physiology including pain perception
(7). Small-ﬁber sensory function is assessed by measuring the
threshold to detect warmth, hot, and cold pain; thinly myelinated ﬁbers are assessed by measurement of threshold to detect
skin cooling and sharpness; and large-ﬁber sensory function is
measured by detection thresholds for cutaneous mechanical
stimuli (8). The pattern of effects of chemotherapy on sensory
function has clear mechanistic implications for the ﬁber types
that are vulnerable to the toxicity of chemotherapy.

Institutional Review Board. Seventy-eight patients were
enrolled and gave informed consent. Patients with any history
of neuropathy or other factors known to contribute to neuropathy including diabetes mellitus, history of alcohol intake
more than 100 g per week, vitamin deﬁciency, nerve compression, or any central nervous system metastasis were excluded.
The typical chemotherapy protocol consisted of oxaliplatin
administered at a dose of 85 mg/m2 on 2-week cycles. Patients
underwent QST before each treatment with oxaliplatin. In
addition, 47 age- and sex-matched volunteers were recruited
to provide comparative data.
QST
QST data were collected with the patients comfortably
seated in a quiet, dedicated psychophysics laboratory in
the daytime hours with the subjects not on analgesics that
might interfere with the tasks. Three sites were tested in each
subject, the tip of the index ﬁnger, the thenar eminence, and the
volar surface of the forearm to encompass the areas of skin that
are typically affected in chronic CIPN patients (2–5). QST were
conducted by two clinical data coordinators with many years of
experience and with previously veriﬁed excellent inter-rater
reliability (2–5). The speciﬁc tests that were performed included the following and were performed in the order described.
Basal skin temperature. Basal skin temperature was
measured using an infrared thermistor positioned against the
skin at each site.
The Slotted Pegboard test. The Slotted Pegboard test
was used to evaluate sensorimotor function (9). Participants
ﬁlled a 55 slotted pegboard with spindles in nonrandom
fashion by one row or column at a time with the dominant
hand and then with the nondominant hand (10). The time for
each participant to complete the task was recorded with a
5-minute (300 seconds) cutoff.
Bumps detection. Bumps detection was used to assess
low threshold mechanosensation (11, 12). Participants used
their index ﬁnger to probe a smooth plate that was divided into
nine blocks, with each block marked by ﬁve colored circles.
Over one of the circles in each block, a bump of varying height
(500 mm in diameter, 2.5–22.5 mm tall) was concealed such
that it was not visible to the patient (3 plates total in the set).
The threshold was deﬁned as the lowest height bump correctly
detected with the next two higher bumps also correctly
detected.
Touch detection threshold. Touch detection threshold
was determined using von Frey monoﬁlaments (Semmes–
Weinstein) in an up/down manner as previously described
(2). The ﬁlaments were applied for 1 second at each testing
site starting with a force of 0.5 g and the patients were unable
to see the stimulus application. If a participant did not feel a
given ﬁlament, the next higher force ﬁlament was applied. If
a participant felt a stimulus, the next lower force ﬁlament
was applied. Threshold was deﬁned as the ﬁrst ﬁlament force
detected by the participant three times.
Sharpness detection threshold. Sharpness detection
threshold was determined using blunted 30-gauge needles
with force determined by weights graded from 8 to 128 g
(10, 13). Weighted needles were applied in order from lightest

5956

to heaviest at each site for 1 second, and participants were
asked to report each stimulus as touch, pressure, sharp, or pain.
The lowest force at which the report of "sharp" or "painful" was
given determined the endpoint for each trial. The ﬁnal threshold was the mean of three trials separated by 30 to 90 seconds.
The starting weight was modiﬁed between trials to manage
errors in anticipation.
Thermal detection threshold. Thermal detection threshold was determined using a 3.6  3.6 cm Peltier probe set at a
baseline temperature of 32 C (2). The probe temperature was
ramped upward at a rate of 0.30 C/second for detection of
warmth and heat pain thresholds, whereas cool detection and
cold pain threshold were determined using a decreasing ramp
of 0.50 C/second. Participants were not given any cue to the
onset of a given trial, nor whether the probe would heat or cool.
Participants were instructed to indicate when they could ﬁrst
detect a change in temperature and then when the temperature became painful; at that point, the probe was immediately
returned to the baseline temperature. The ﬁnal threshold was
the average of three heating and cooling trials separated by 30
to 90 seconds.
Descriptors of symptoms. Descriptors of symptoms
were assessed using questionnaires and a standardized body
map presented to the participants at each meeting (2). The
participants marked areas where they felt pain with a red
pen and areas where they felt tingling or numbness with a
green pen. Participants also selected descriptors for their
symptoms from a standardized list (2) that was previously
validated (14).
Data analysis
Analysis of the data was based on total cumulative oxaliplatin dose that patients received before each test. In this
manner, patient data were stratiﬁed into baseline (cumulative
dose 0), low (115.7–345.1 mg), medium (347.1–737.8 mg), and
high dose (739.5–2328.2 mg) categories established by empirical analysis. Patients only contributed one set of data per dose
category with that included at the highest dose if sampled more
than once within a given category. Finally, patients were also
tested at approximately 6 months after chemotherapy. The
nonparametric Kruskal–Wallis test was applied to all data.
Patient data were compared with that from the health volunteers only for the baseline time point. The patient data collected at the time points during and following chemotherapy
were compared with the patient baseline dataset. Signiﬁcance
was deﬁned as any P value < 0.05.

Results
Patient demographics and clinical data are shown
in Table 1. The breakdown by treatment category resulted
in 51 patients in the baseline group because some had not
agreed to take part in the study before starting chemotherapy. Sixty-two patients were included in the low-dose category; 54 in the medium-dose category; and 49 in the high
cumulative dose category. Finally, 27 patients underwent
QST at a postchemotherapy follow-up examination at a
mean of 165 (12) days after the last chemotherapy. The

Touch detection
The detection of touch using von Frey ﬁlaments engages
large diameter Ab slowly adapting Merkel complex mechanoreceptors (16, 17). There was no difference between touch
detection threshold between healthy volunteers and patients
before therapy. Touch threshold did show increasing deﬁcit
with dose during chemotherapy that became statistically
signiﬁcant in the ﬁngertips at middle and high chemotherapy
doses (Fig. 2A, P < 0.05). Similarly, touch threshold in the
thenar eminence gradually increased with chemotherapy
dose and was statistically signiﬁcant between the patient

numbers vary due to missed visits and/or loss of subjects to
the study over time.
Pegboard test
Patients at baseline took signiﬁcantly more time to complete
the pegboard test with the dominant hand than volunteers did
(Fig. 1A, P < 0.001). The same was observed for the nondominant hand (Fig. 1B, P < 0.001). Subsequent pegboard tests
collected during chemotherapy did not show any differences
from the patient baseline value. Indeed, there was a trend in
both hands for a slight decline in pegboard time, most likely
reﬂecting a training effect (none of the volunteers were allowed
training before their data collection).
Bumps detection
The Bumps test is an assessment of large diameter Ab
ﬁber mechanoreceptor function best correlated to transduction by Meissner's corpuscles (12, 15). The patients
showed a signiﬁcantly elevated Bumps threshold at baseline compared with healthy volunteers (Fig. 1C, P < 0.01).
There was a clear trend for the impairment seen at the
patient baseline QST to worsen during therapy, with this
difference becoming statistically signiﬁcant from the
patient baseline in the high-dose chemotherapy group (Fig.
1C, P < 0.05). The mean bump detection score in patients
who had undergone high cumulative doses of oxaliplatin
was 2.1 times that of volunteers (6.33  0.68 in patients vs.
3.32  0.32 in healthy volunteers; P < 0.05; Fig. 2A).
However, patients in the follow-up group displayed the
most signiﬁcant impairment in bump detection compared

baseline for those patients receiving high-dose chemotherapy
(Fig. 2A, P < 0.05). Interestingly, these deﬁcits resolved at the
6-month follow-up test. Touch threshold in hairy skin showed
no change at any time point.
Sharpness detection
Sharpness detection threshold is an assessment of thinly
myelinated Ad ﬁbers. There were no differences observed in
sharpness detection between healthy volunteers and patients
before chemotherapy (Fig. 2B). There was also no change
shown in sharpness detection in patients at the various cumulative doses of chemotherapy compared with the patient
baseline.
Basal skin temperature
The patient group showed signiﬁcantly cooler skin
temperature in the ﬁngertips before chemotherapy than
that found in the healthy volunteer group (Fig. 3). Interestingly, skin temperature returned toward that of healthy
volunteers in the treatment groups, but this change was
not signiﬁcant compared with the patient baseline group.
Temperature detection
The detection of warming is dependent on inputs from
subgroups of unmyelinated C ﬁbers given the relatively slow
heat ramps that were used in this study. The patient baseline
warm detection threshold was signiﬁcantly elevated from
that of healthy volunteers at all three test sites (Fig. 4A, P <

0.01–0.001). Warm detection in the treatment groups
showed no change from the patient baseline. However, warm
detection threshold was signiﬁcantly increased from the
patient baseline in the 6-month follow-up group (Fig. 4A,
P < 0.05–0.001). Heat pain threshold also mediated by
unmyelinated C ﬁbers tended to be higher in the patient
group at baseline compared with that of the healthy volunteers, but this difference did not achieve statistical signiﬁcance. No change in heat pain threshold from the patient
baseline was observed in any of the treatment groups or at 6month follow-up (Fig. 4B).
Cool and cold pain detection is mediated by activity in thinly
myelinated Ad and unmyelinated C ﬁbers, respectively. The
patients had a signiﬁcantly lower threshold to detect skin

cooling at the baseline measure before chemotherapy than
the healthy volunteers in both the ﬁngertips and the hairy skin
of the volar forearm (Fig. 5A, P < 0.05–0.01). This threshold
showed a further deﬁcit at 6-months follow-up compared
with the patient baseline. The patient baseline cold pain
threshold was signiﬁcantly elevated compared with the healthy
volunteers in both the thenar eminence and volar forearm
(Fig. 5B, P < 0.01). Chemotherapy treatment increased this
deﬁcit such that the moderate and high doses resulted in
pain at signiﬁcantly warmer temperatures than at the patient
baseline (Fig. 5B, P < 0.05–0.01). This deﬁcit showed some
resolution at 6-months follow-up back toward the original
patient baseline, though cold pain in the volar forearm
remained signiﬁcantly different.

Neuropathy score and symptom complaints
Figure 6A shows the overall neuropathy scores for the
healthy volunteers and for each of the patient groups tabulated by determining the number of measures in the QST
battery for each subject that were 2 SDs or more outside
the healthy volunteer mean values. The mean neuropathy
score for the healthy volunteers was predictably very low,
and as detailed in the previous sections, the value for the
patients at baseline was signiﬁcantly higher (Fig. 6A, P <
0.01). The mean neuropathy scores showed signiﬁcant further increases from the patient baseline value with chemotherapy dose and had a peak at the 6-month follow-up
(Fig. 6A, P < 0.05–0.01). Figure 6B shows the percentage of
subjects in each group that had QST measures that were
2 SDs or more outside the healthy volunteer mean values
(ﬁlled circles). Approximately 25% of the healthy volunteers
had at least one out-of-range measure compared with
roughly three quarters of the patients (P < 0.01). Notably,
the QST deﬁcits in the patients at baseline were subclinical
as none reported any numbness or pain at the baseline
measure (Fig. 6B, open circles and ﬁlled triangles). The
percentage of patients with abnormal QST measures showed
a continuous increase across the treatment groups with the
ﬁnal peak at the 6-month follow-up (Fig. 6B, ﬁlled circles).
The decay in sensory function was paralleled by increasing
reports of numbness and pain in the patient groups such
that by 6-months follow-up, roughly three quarters of the
patients reported numbness and roughly one ﬁfth reported
pain. Finally, Fig. 6C shows the rates of symptom complaint
that developed during chemotherapy or present at follow-up
based on whether the patients had a baseline QST deﬁcit.
The frequency of both numbness and pain was signiﬁcantly
increased in the patients who presented with subclinical
neuropathy versus those who did not.

Discussion
This is the ﬁrst study to use repeated QST in the study of the
development of CIPN bringing a highly sensitive method to
detect sensory impairments to this ﬁeld (8). A key ﬁnding
from this approach was the detection of preexisting subclinical
sensory deﬁcits in a large cohort of patients with colorectal
cancer before treatment that seems to be disease driven and
that when present seems to increase the risk for the later
development of clinical CIPN. This observation, therefore,
provides a generalization of a correlation between apparent
subclinical pretreatment neuropathy and risk for CIPN as
previously suggested in patients with multiple myeloma
(10, 11, 15). A caveat, however, is that QST was not performed
on the feet for convenience of the patients, yet CIPN often ﬁrst
presents in the feet. Hence, this study may present an overly
conservative survey of QST deﬁcits, particularly those that
remained subclinical, that occurred in this patient cohort. It
should be noted, however, that all of our subjects who became
symptomatic complained of symptoms in the hands as well as
the feet.
Perhaps the most important ﬁndings of this study are the
mechanistic implications for impact of chemotherapy on

dependent to a degree on cutaneous mechanoreceptors, is
more dependent on sensorimotor coordination involving
neural inputs from muscle and joint mechanoreceptors that
engage spinocerebellar and cortical cognitive processing.
The pegboard test was signiﬁcantly worse for patients at
baseline compared with healthy controls, but then did not
show any decay from that level and even a trend toward
improvement. On the other hand, patient mechanoreceptor
function tested using the Bumps test not only showed a
difference at baseline from healthy volunteers, but also
showed signiﬁcant further deterioration with increasing
chemotherapy doses and evidence of coasting following the
termination of chemotherapy. Mechanoreceptor function
assessed using von Frey monoﬁlaments showed much of
the same results as in the Bumps test. The difference
between the pegboard to the Bumps and von Frey tests
could be explained by assuming that the patients learned to
cognitively overcome mechanoreceptor deﬁcits in the former, whereas the lack of learning cues in the latter tests
prevented this compensation. Alternatively, this paradox in
results could also indicate that the myelinated ﬁbers innervating the different tissues involved in these tasks show
differential toxic deﬁcit to oxaliplatin.
The Ad ﬁber-dependent tasks seem to provide clear psychophysical evidence in support of a differential susceptibility
of primary afferent ﬁbers to toxic insult by chemotherapy.
Although the percept of sharpness/sharp pain evoked by the
weighted needles showed little change at baseline or with
chemotherapy, the detection of skin cooling showed a clear
impairment. Similarly, various groups of C ﬁbers are recruited
in the detection of warm, heat, and cold pain, yet the patients
showed preserved heat pain in the context of altered warmth
and cold pain detection. Thus, for each group of ﬁbers,
psychophysical evidence indicates that the mechanism
of toxicity engaged by chemotherapeutics differentially
impacts function in different subtypes of primary afferent
ﬁbers, resulting in the clinical phenotype that is observed.
One possible explanation that ﬁts this criterion well is the
recent demonstration of an interaction of the chemotherapeutic paclitaxel with Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4; ref. 19). Not
all, but only subsets of small (C-ﬁber) and medium sized (Ad
ﬁber) DRG neurons express TLR4 following chemotherapy
treatment and show signs of an activated innate immune
response including an increase in the expression of proinﬂam-

matory cytokines such as MCP-1 (20). The effects of MCP-1 and
other cytokines on peripheral nerves could account for the
clinical presentation of CIPN and the known risk and protective factors. Schwann cells express cytokine receptors that
when activated lead to dedifferentiation and downregulation
of myelin synthesis (21–24). This would consequently have
pronounced functional impact on Ab ﬁbers that require extensive myelination, but less so on C-ﬁbers, thus generating a
clinical picture like that observed in the patient studies as
described here. Finally, this mechanism would explain the
observed effects of anticytokine treatments, such as minocycline, in preventing CIPN (25, 26) and suggests a clear shortterm target for clinical evaluation in preventing a major
complication of cancer treatment.
