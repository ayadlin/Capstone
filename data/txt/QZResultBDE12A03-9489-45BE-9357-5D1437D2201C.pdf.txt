Breast Cancer Tumor Suppressors: A Special
Emphasis on Novel Protein Nischarin
Mazvita Maziveyi and Suresh K. Alahari

Abstract
Tumor suppressor genes regulate cell growth and prevent
spontaneous proliferation that could lead to aberrant tissue
function. Deletions and mutations of these genes typically lead
to progression through the cell-cycle checkpoints, as well as
increased cell migration. Studies of these proteins are important
as they may provide potential treatments for breast cancers. In this
review, we discuss a comprehensive overview on Nischarin, a
novel protein discovered by our laboratory. Nischarin, or imidazoline receptor antisera-selected protein, is a protein involved in a

vast number of cellular processes, including neuronal protection
and hypotension. The NISCH promoter experiences hypermethylation in several cancers, whereas some highly aggressive breast
cancer cells exhibit genomic loss of the NISCH locus. Furthermore, we discuss data illustrating a novel role of Nischarin as
a tumor suppressor in breast cancer. Analysis of this new paradigm may shed light on various clinical questions. Finally, the
therapeutic potential of Nischarin is discussed. Cancer Res; 75(20);

Introduction

(6, 7). It also interacts with LIM kinase (LIMK) in order to prevent
cytoskeletal reorganization (8). Typically, scaffold proteins such
as Nischarin are characterized as caretaker genes because their
effects on tumor growth are indirect.

Breast cancer initiation and progression involve several genetic
events that can activate oncogenes and/or abrogate the function of
tumor suppressor genes. Tumor suppressor genes are commonly
lost or deleted in cancers, facilitating the initiation and progression of cancer through several biological events, including cell
proliferation, cell death, cell migration, and cell invasion. Usually,
cancer mortality occurs due to complications of metastasis rather
than the mass effect of the primary tumor, and several tumor
suppressors regulate metastasis. Genetic modiﬁcations through
allelic loss are one of the important factors for deregulation of
tumor suppressor genes. Importantly, promoter hypermethylation of several tumor suppressors has been shown to be associated
with tumor progression. In addition, several signaling mechanisms are dysregulated in breast cancer as a result of mutations in
these genes. Among the tumor suppressors, BRCA1/2, p53, PTEN,
ATM, Rb, LKB, Nm23, and p16 have been studied in great detail
and discussed in many review articles (1–3). This article primarily
emphasizes the novel tumor suppressor Nischarin (Fig. 1) and
how it regulates cell migration, cell invasion, tumor growth, and
metastasis through various signaling pathways and interactions
with other proteins. Caretaker genes, such as BRCA1, are genes
whose loss does not directly inhibit tumor growth (1, 4, 5).
Nischarin imposes its tumor-suppressive functions through its
interactions with other proteins; thus, it is a caretaker tumor
suppressor gene. For example, it interacts with p21 activated
kinase 1 (PAK1) and integrin a5 to prevent cell migration

Discovery of Nischarin
The ﬁrst function attributed to Nischarin was its role as an
integrin a5b1 binding protein (9). In this way, Nischarin is able to
regulate cell motility, speciﬁcally by anatomization of cell signaling proteins that contribute to tumor cell migration and invasion
(10). The structural and functional domains of Nischarin promote
its interaction with 17 known proteins to inﬂuence cell adhesion,
cell migration, vesicle trafﬁcking, apoptosis, glucose metabolism,
and cell signaling. Thus far, diseases associated with the NISCH
gene include hypertension, xerostomia, morphine dependence,
depression, anxiety, ventricular hypertrophy, congestive heart
failure, rosacea, several cancers (11). Its location at 3p21.1 puts
it in a category of tumor suppressor genes that are associated with
the development of many cancers (12). Highly aggressive breast
cancer cells frequently exhibit genomic loss of the NISCH locus
(12), whereas the NISCH promoter is hypermethylated in lung
cancers (13). Nischarin mRNA and protein expression is high in
stage 0 human breast specimens but reduced in stage I–IV breast
cancer specimens (12).

NISCH Regulation
The structural and functional domains of Nischarin
Nischarin was ﬁrst characterized 15 years ago by SK Alahari
and colleagues (10). The 37,955 bases of the full-length NISCH
gene are regulated by the transcription factors max1, sp1,
COUP, olf-1, COUP-TF, pax-4a, ATF, and c-Myc (11). Soon
after, the human homolog of Nischarin was discovered as
imidazoline receptor antisera-selected protein (IRAS; ref. 14).
Human IRAS has 80% homology with rodent Nischarin but
interestingly, the integrin a5-binding sites of Nischarin and

The predicted post-translational modiﬁcations of Nischarin. Ubiquitination of Nischarin is predicted to occur at K1009, K1015, K1290, K1299, and K1303. Acetylation
is predicted to occur at K1015. The predicted human Nischarin phosphorylation sites are S246, S250, T252, S477, S541, S546, S883, S1022, S1038, T1282,
S1284, Y1293, Y1294, and Y1307. Both Nischarin's PX domain, and its coiled-coil domain are essential for endosomal targeting and interaction with
phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PI3P) in PI3P-enriched endosomes. Amino acids 1–624 of Nischarin strongly interact with p21-activated kinase 1 (PAK1).
LKB1 interacts with positions 416–624 of Nischarin. Insulin receptor substrates 1–4 interact with the C-terminal domain of Nischarin. Positions 416–624 of
Nischarin are sufﬁcient to interact with LIMK. Residues 464 to 562 of Nischarin interact with the integrin a5 cytoplasmic tail. Rab14 interacts with Nischarin's
C-terminus. Both the N- and C-terminus of Nischarin interact with Rac1.

IRAS are 100% identical (Fig. 2; ref. 14). In humans, Nischarin/
IRAS was ﬁrst discovered as an I1-imidazoline receptor, which
are expressed in both neurons and astrocytes (14, 15). Human
and mouse Nischarin differ in the alanine/proline rich region,
which is removed in human Nischarin (Fig. 2).
Nischarin is a cytosolic protein that anchors itself to the inner
layer of the plasma membrane and has been found to interact
with both cytosolic and intermembrane proteins (16). Human
Nischarin has four isoforms that are achieved by alternative
splicing (9). Isoform 1 encodes the full-length protein and is
highly expressed in neural and endocrine tissue (Fig. 2; ref. 9).
Isoform 2 has amino acids 1–511 spliced and is expressed in
the brain (9). Isoform 3, also known as IRAS-L, is highly
expressed in the brain, missing amino acids 584–1504, and
has a modiﬁed sequence in amino acids 511–583 (9). Isoform
4, also known as IRAS-S, is also highly expressed in the brain,
has amino acids 516–1504 spliced out, and has a change in
amino acids between 512 and 515 (9). Isoform 1 is 166,629
Da, isoform 2 is 110,194 Da, isoform 3 is 63,997 Da, and
isoform 4 is 56,867 Da (9).
Mouse Nischarin has seven isoforms that are achieved by
alternative splicing (Fig. 2; ref. 17). Isoform 1 is full-length
Nischarin, which is 1,593 amino acids (17). Isoform 2 is
missing amino acids 348–500 and isoform 3 is missing amino
acids 1–245 (17). Amino acids 437–472 of isoform 4 differ
from the canonical sequence and it is also missing amino acids
473–1593 (17). Amino acids 332–334 of isoform 5 have a
sequence difference and amino acids 335–1593 are missing
(17). Isoform 6 also has a sequence difference between 513 and

www.aacrjournals.org

516, as well as amino acids 517–1593 missing (17). Isoform 7
has a long amino acid sequence difference between 122–153
and amino acids 143–1593 missing (17).
Furthermore, the N-terminus of Nischarin contains a phox
(PX) domain from amino acids 11–121 (Fig. 1; ref. 18). This
PX domain is necessary for plasma membrane and vesicular
targeting of Nischarin (19). Both Nischarin's PX domain, and
its coiled-coil domain (634–695) are essential for endosomal
targeting and interaction with phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate
PI3P in endosomes enriched in this phospholipid (Fig. 1; ref. 19).
Though the interaction of PI3P and Nischarin alone is not
sufﬁcient for endosomal targeting, this interaction occurs around
region 2–133 of Nischarin. Although regions 120–695 are necessary for Nischarin to be targeted to the endosomes, mutation of
amino acids 49 and 50 inhibit endosomal targeting (18).
Interestingly, other regions of Nischarin have been found to
interact with other signaling molecules as well. For example,
amino acids 1–624 of Nischarin have been found to strongly
interact with p21 activated kinase 1 (PAK1) to prevent cell
migration (Fig. 1; ref. 6). Positions 416–624 of Nischarin are
sufﬁcient to interact with LIMK in order to prevent cytoskeletal
reorganization (Fig. 1; ref. 8). LKB1 interacts with positions 416–
624 of Nischarin to prevent cancer progression (Fig. 1; ref. 20). In
addition, Rab14 and insulin receptor substrates 1–4 interact with
the c-terminal domain of Nischarin (Fig. 1; refs. 21, 22). Among
the known binding partners of Nischarin, its interaction with
integrin a5 is the best characterized.
Integrins are cell adhesion proteins with a and b transmembrane heterodimers that play a major role in transmitting

signals from outside of the cell membrane to the inside of the
cell and vice versa. The cytosolic portion of the transmembrane
heterodimer interacts with a number of cytoskeletal proteins
and signaling molecules, including Ras and MAPK (21). Extracellular signals trigger signaling cascades that modulate cell
behaviors such as cytoskeletal remodeling. The membrane
proximal region of the integrin a5 subunit has been shown
to interact with Nischarin to inhibit cell migration (Fig. 3;
refs. 7, 10). Residues 464 to 562 of Nischarin interact with
residues 1017 to 1030 of the a5 cytoplasmic tail, also known as
the membrane proximal region (12). More speciﬁcally, Tyr
1018 and Lys1022 are crucial points for this a5–Nischarin

interaction (7). When Nischarin is overexpressed, a5 integrin
promoter activity decreases (12). The exact mechanism of
Nischarin downregulation of a5-integrin is unknown (12). It
has been hypothesized that the leucine zipper domain of
Nischarin interacts with other leucine zipper-containing transcription factors to inﬂuence the gene expression of integrin a5
(12). Increased expression of integrin a5b1 has been linked to
reduced tumor growth rates, regulation of muscle cell growth,
and reduced apoptosis (23). Because Nischarin has been found
to regulate the expression of other proteins, it is important to
characterize its domains and interacting partners in order to
better understand global tissue expression patterns. On the

Tumor Suppressor Nischarin

Focal adhesions

Figure 3.
The tumor-suppressive function of
Nischarin. Nischarin decreases FAK
phosphorylation levels due to
decreased a5-integrin expression.
Reduced FAK phosphorylation thus
prevents ERK activation via Ras and
MEK, resulting in decreased cell
survival. Nischarin and LKB1 interact to
reduce tumor growth, regulate cell
migration, metastasis, and anchorageindependent growth. Nischarin
directly interacts with PAK1 to prevent
its kinase activity and decrease
cytoskeletal remodeling. PAK targets
cell migration signaling pathways
through MLCK and LIMK.
Phosphorylation of LIMK through PAK
inhibits coﬁlin, an actin severing
protein, thus leading to actin ﬁlament
assembly. Nischarin binds to the
kinase domain of active LIMK to
deactivate it and to prevent actin
ﬁlament assembly during cytoskeletal
reorganization.

basis of Nischarin interaction with several proteins, we believe
it functions as a scaffolding protein.
Nischarin tissue expression
In cell lines, Nischarin mRNA levels are highest in multiple
rodent neuronal, epithelial, and ﬁbroblast cell lines (10). Furthermore, its expression levels have been noted in humans, rodents,
chicken, lizards, zebraﬁsh, cows, dogs, opossums, chimpanzees,
platypus, sea squirts, fruit ﬂies, mosquitos, worms, and the African
clawed frog (11). Speciﬁcally, Nischarin expression has been found
in the embryo, diencephalon, hindbrain, midbrain, future spinal
cord, hypothalamus, neocortex, ganglionic eminence, hippocampus, cerebellum, spinal cord, meninges, choroid plexus, basal
ganglia, amygdale, cerebral cortex, brainstem, olfactory bulb, retina, cap mesenchyme, renal interstitium group, ovaries, primary sex
cord, female and male associated reproductive structures, heart,
liver, lung, metanephros, and skeletal muscle (Table 1; ref. 24). In
the breast, Nischarin expression is normal in stage 0 breast specimens but reduced in stage I–IV breast cancer specimens (12). Given
that the deregulation of Nischarin is a frequent event underlying the
development of multiple diseases, understanding the mechanisms
contributing to its regulation is imperative.
The predicted post-translational modiﬁcations of Nischarin
Protein ubiquitination is important for many biologic processes, including immunity and cell differentiation (25). It has been
linked to many disease progressions, including metabolic syn-

dromes, muscle dystrophy, cancer, neurodegeneration, autoimmunity, and inﬂammatory diseases (25). Ubiquitination of
Nischarin is predicted to occur at K1009, K1015, K1290,
K1299, and K1303 (Fig. 1; ref. 26). Acetylation is predicted to
occur at K1015 (Fig. 1; ref. 26). Lysine conjugation has been found
to target large macromolecular complexes involved in processes
such as nuclear transport, actin nucleation, chromatin remodeling, cell cycle, and splicing (27). Protein phosphorylation is
important and necessary for protein signal transduction. The
predicted human Nischarin phosphorylation sites are S246,
S250, T252, S477, S541, S546, S883, S1022, S1038, T1282,
S1284, Y1293, Y1294, and Y1307 (Fig. 1; ref. 26).

Nischarin Participates in Insulin Signaling
The carboxy terminus of Nischarin has been found to bind to
the carboxy terminus of insulin receptor substrate 4 (IRS-4; Fig. 1;
ref. 22). The IRS family is a family of adaptor proteins that are
recruited and phosphorylated after insulin binds to and activates
the insulin tyrosine receptor kinase (IR). Phosphorylated IRS is
activated and participates in a number of signaling cascades that
have growth and mitogenic effects (22). Overexpression of human
Nischarin in human embryonic kidney 293 cells induces a 4-fold
increase of insulin-stimulated activation of ERK (22). The tyrosine
phosphorylation of the IRS-4 and Src homology 2 domain-containing (shc) initiates this ERK activation in response to insulin (22).
IRS and shc then bind to growth factor receptor-bound protein

2 (Grb2) for activation (22). Grb2 then associates with Son of
sevenless homolog (Sos), the guanine nucleotide exchange protein
for Ras (22). Sos elevates the GTP-bound form of Ras, which
results in increased ERK activation and then cell growth (22).
ERK inactivation prevents cell survival, growth, and differentiation of the cancerous cells (12). A weaker interaction is also
seen between Nischarin and IRS-1, IRS-2, and IRS-3 (22).
Alternatively, the tyrosine phosporylation of IRS4 promotes the
activation of the PI3K signaling cascade. PI3K is a key kinase that
plays a role in the mitogenic and metabolic effects of insulin (28).
After PI3K activation, the substrates PI(3,4,5)P3, PI(3,4)P2, and PI
(3)P recruit PI3K-dependent serine/threonine kinases (PDK1)
and Akt to the plasma membrane for activation (28). Activated
Akt regulates a number of cellular processes, including the activation of the Glut 4 transporter that participates in glucose uptake
(28). Akt also activates p70s6k, a serine/threonine kinase that
regulates protein synthesis (29). Akt activation also induces

4256 Cancer Res; 75(20) October 15, 2015

synthesis of SREBP 1 and 2 to promote fatty acid synthesis
(30). Taken together, this shows that Nischarin participates in
insulin signaling to increase cell survival.

Nischarin in the Brain
Nischarin is highly expressed on the leading edge of neurons
(31). Silencing of Nischarin in both rat and mouse neurons has
been found to increase neuronal migration (31). Nischarin is
expressed by mature neurons to prevent them from further
migration (31). Neuronal migration is necessary in the embryonic
period for normal brain formation (31). Because Nischarin has
higher expression in layers IV–V of the cortex, it is expressed by
mature neurons that no longer need to migrate (31).
Nischarin is a neuroprotective protein
Nischarin has been found to induce neuronal apoptosis
through the PI3K and protein kinase B (PKB) pathways. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is a proinﬂammatory component found on
the outer membrane of Gram negative bacteria (32). Upon
injection of LPS, proinﬂammation factors are produced and
apoptosis occurs downstream of the release (32). One study
showed that upon intracerebroventricular injection of LPS into
male Sprague–Dawley rats, Nischarin levels progressively
increased for one day then gradually decreased from 3 to 7 days
(32). Colocalization was also seen between Nischarin, Bcl-2–
associated death promoter (BAD), and pAKT, which indicates
an upregulation in the PI3K/AKT pathway (32). These results
demonstrate that Nischarin is a neuroprotective protein (32).
Nischarin levels are increased in the amygdala in response to
anxiety
During an anxiety response, the genes participating in the
synthesis of neurotransmitters are typically up regulated (33).
There are also a number of genes involved in signal transduction
that are upregulated (33). A better understanding of the molecular
mechanisms of anxiety disorders can lead to the discovery of more
effective drugs. The amygdala has long been found to regulate
emotional behavior and vigilance (33). It processes the input of
emotional stimuli and inﬂuences the output of the behavioral
response (33). Cat odor exposure to rats induces a behavioral
response consistent with anxiety (33). Rho GTPase-activating
protein and Rho-speciﬁc guanine nucleotide exchange factor are
present in the amygdala of a normal rat because of their involvement in the guidance of growth cones (33). After cat odor
exposure to the rats, the proteins involved in that pathway were
no longer detected (33). Also, a 1.2-fold increase was seen in the
expression of Nischarin during the anxiety response (33). It is
proposed that during an anxiety response, Nischarin inhibits the
activity of the Rho GTPase pathway (33). Nischarin is also
associated with morphine dependence, depression, and brain
disease (11), suggesting that it is an important regulator in the
brain.

Nischarin Plays a Role in Hypotension
The generation of pERK1/2 in the rostral ventrolateral
medulla (RVLM) has implications in I1R-activated hypotension
(34). In PC12 cells, this I1R activation depends on nischarin
to generate pERK1/2 levels (34). Nischarin knockdown in the
RVLM abolishes I1 receptor activation in the RVLM and

produces a hypotensive response (34). Rilmendine, a drug used
to treat hypertension, elicits its hypotensive effects by increasing the production of pERK1/2 in the RVLM (34). Central
administration of rilmenidine was attenuated by rats that had
reduced Nischarin expression, compared with the control
(34). Rats with Nischarin antisense ODNs abrogated I1R activation by abolishing pERK1/2 levels and hypotensive responses (34). These ﬁndings indicate that Nischarin participates in
pERK1/2-mediated hypotension.

Nischarin in Cancer
Nischarin is a tumor suppressor of ovarian cancer
Nischarin expression is downregulated in ovarian cancer tissues
(35). This decreased expression of Nischarin is associated with
invasiveness, tumor stage, lymph node metastasis, and histologic
tumor grade (35). Interestingly, ovarian cancer patients with
Nischarin expression have a better overall survival than nonexpressing patients (35). The NISH promoter is hypermethylated
in 36.7% of ovarian cancers (35). Overexpression of this tumor
suppressor in an ovarian cancer cell line imposes a G1 phase arrest
and cyclin D1 downregulation, which leads to decelerated cell
proliferation (35). It has been shown that Nischarin exerts its
tumor-suppressive effects through FAK in ovarian cancer (35). The
role of Nischarin in ovarian cancer has recently been discovered
and further studies are needed to understand the tumor-suppressive effect of Nischarin in ovarian cancer.
Nischarin is a tumor suppressor of breast cancer
Nischarin is known to control cell migration by antagonizing
the actions of cell signaling proteins that contribute to tumor cell
migration and invasion (10). This protein maps at 3p21.1 and it
has been shown that regions of chromosome 3p are associated
with the development of many cancers (12). Highly aggressive
breast cancer cells exhibit genomic loss of the NISCH locus and
Nischarin promoter methylation is seen in 30% of breast cancers
(12). A study of 962 human breast cancer patients from TCGA
revealed that 0.3% of breast invasive carcinomas exhibit a deletion of Nischarin, and 0.7% of breast invasive carcinomas have a
mutated Nischarin (36).
Loss of Nischarin plays a signiﬁcant role in breast cancer cell
progression. Correspondingly, Nischarin mRNA is highly
expressed in normal breast tissue but poorly expressed in human
breast cancer specimens (12). Highly invasive breast cancer cell
lines such as MDA-MB-231 exhibit low Nischarin expression
levels, moderately invasive breast cancer cell lines such as
MCF-7 exhibit higher Nischarin expression levels, and nontumorigenic cells such as MCF-10A have the highest amount of
Nischarin expression (12). Restoring Nischarin expression in
aggressive breast cancer cell lines decreases focal adhesion kinase
(FAK) phosphorylation levels due to decreased a5-integrin
expression (12). Reduced FAK phosphorylation thus prevents
ERK activation, resulting in decreased cell survival (12).
Analysis of human breast cancer patient tumors revealed that
tissues with lymph node metastasis have signiﬁcantly decreased
levels of Nischarin than patients without lymph node metastasis
(37). In addition, LOH studies performed using microsatellite
markers in DNA samples from 18 human breast cancers and their
normal tissue counterparts, revealed that LOH is seen in 50% of
human breast cancer patients, which results in decreased
Nischarin expression (12). Therefore, promoter methylation and

www.aacrjournals.org

LOH are the leading causes of reduced Nischarin expression in
breast cancers (12).
Nischarin inhibits cell migration and invasion
Nischarin has been found to interact with a number of signaling
proteins such as integrin a5, PAK1, LIMK1, Rab14, LKB1, and
Rac1. Liver kinase B1 (LKB1) is a tumor suppressor that has a role
in cell polarity and the regulation of metabolism through the
mTOR pathway (38). Like Nischarin, LKB1 inhibits PAK phosphorylation to prevent actin ﬁlament assembly during cytoskeletal reorganization (20). LKB1 interacts with amino acids 416–
624 of Nischarin to increase its kinase activity (20). Nischarin and
LKB1 both reduce tumor growth, regulate cell migration, metastasis, and anchorage-dependent growth (Fig. 3; ref. 20).
Rac1 is a Rho GTPase family member that regulates a number
of signaling pathways, including the organization and assembly
of actin in response to the extracellular environment. Several
downstream effectors exert the biologic effects of Rac1. Rac1
activates NF-kB transcription factors, leading to inﬂammatory
responses, cell growth, and apoptotic suppression (39). Both the
N- and C-terminus of Nischarin interacts with Rac1 in its active
state to disrupt the NF-kB pathway and thus repress cyclin D1, the
promoter associated with malignancy (Fig. 3; ref. 40). Also,
reduced activation of Rac1 by Nischarin results in reduced tumor
growth (12).
Nischarin has been found to inhibit the Rac1 effector, p21
activated kinase (PAK), to prevent Rac1 driven cell migration
(41). Nischarin directly interacts with PAK1 and prevents its
kinase activity (Fig. 3; ref. 40). PAK targets cell migration
signaling pathways through myosin light chain kinase (MLCK)
and LIMK (40). The activation of MLCK through PAK phosphorylates myosin light chain, which regulates actin cytoskeletal dynamics (40). LIMK is highly expressed in cancer
cells and has been highly regarded as an oncogene (8). Phosphorylation of LIMK through PAK inhibits coﬁlin, an actin
severing protein, thus leading to actin ﬁlament assembly (41).
Nischarin binds to the kinase domain of active LIMK to deactivate it and prevents actin ﬁlament assembly during cytoskeletal reorganization (Fig. 3; ref. 8).
Nischarin also interacts with a number of signaling proteins to inhibit apoptosis (12). In PC12 and Cos7 cell lines,
Nischarin has been found to inhibit the activation of caspase-3,
a critical apoptosis mediator (42). Upon staurosporine and
thapsigargin treatment, Nischarin-transfected cells show
decrease in apoptotic activity (42). This inhibition of apoptosis
leads to increased cell survival. It is not clear how Nischarin can
inhibit tumor growth as well as apoptosis, which needs further
investigation.

Therapeutic Importance of Nischarin
Nischarin's strong tumor-suppressive effect can be used to
reverse the invasive capacity of cancer cells, making it an appealing
option in developing future cancer treatments. It has been well
demonstrated that the loss of Nischarin leads to increased focal
adhesions, cytoskeletal organization, cell migration, tumor
growth, and cell survival. Increasing expression of Nischarin in
tumor cells would reduce the invasive and migratory capacity of
cancer cells. Also, because LOH was seen in 50% of human breast
cancer patients, Nischarin could be used as a clinical biomarker
for patients.

Maziveyi and Alahari

To compensate for lost or reduced Nischarin function in
tumors, it is possible to create peptide-based drugs that mimic
Nischarin's natural interactions. Peptide-based drugs are advantageous for high potency, high selectivity, and low toxicity treatment (43). Designing a small peptide-based drug that mimics the
different domains of Nischarin could decrease the migratory
effects of the cancer cells. For example, designing a peptide drug
with the amino acids of Nischarin that are necessary to bind
integrin a5 would decrease integrin a-5–mediated cell migration.
In conclusion, Nischarin has been shown to be an important
protein in the maintenance of normal cell function, and its
dysfunction is widely implicated in human disease. Its expression
is most evident within cells of the immune, nervous, secretory,
muscular, and reproductive systems (11). A role for Nischarin in
many cell processes has now been described, but its most wellcharacterized functions involve its regulation of cell migration,

which it achieves by interacting with a number of proteins. Over
30 research papers have been published on Nischarin and further
studies of this protein will increase current knowledge in the ﬁelds
of cancer biology, cell migration, apoptosis, vesicle trafﬁcking, cell
adhesion, signal transduction, and hypertension. This dynamic
scaffolding protein is ideal for studying cell signaling pathways in
a vast number of diseases. A deeper understanding of Nischarinmediated pathways will help predict disease progression and
provide better therapeutic targets for breast cancer patients.
