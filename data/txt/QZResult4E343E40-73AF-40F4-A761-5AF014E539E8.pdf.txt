Abstract

Author Manuscript

Acetylation within the globular core domain of histone H3 on lysine 56 has recently been shown
to play a critical role in packaging DNA into chromatin following DNA replication and repair in
budding yeast 1, 2. However, the function or occurrence of this specific histone mark has not been
studied in multi-cellular eukaryotes, mainly because the Rtt109 enzyme that is known to mediate
acetylation of H3 K56 (H3 K56Ac) is fungal-specific 34. Here we demonstrate that in flies and
humans the histone acetyl transferases CBP / p300 acetylate H3 K56, while Sir2 / hSirT1 / hSirT2
deacetylate H3 K56Ac. The histone chaperone Asf1 in Drosophila, Asf1a in humans, is required
for acetylation of H3 K56 in vivo, while the histone chaperone CAF-1 is required for the
incorporation of histones bearing this mark into chromatin. We show that in response to DNA
damage, histones bearing acetylated K56 are assembled into chromatin in Drosophila and human
cells, forming foci that colocalize with sites of DNA repair. Furthermore, acetylation of H3 K56 is
elevated in multiple types of cancer, correlating with elevated levels of Asf1a in these tumors. Our
identification of multiple proteins regulating the levels of H3 K56 acetylation in higher eukaryotes
will allow future studies of this critical and unique histone modification that couples chromatin
assembly to DNA synthesis, cell proliferation and cancer.

H3 K56 acetylation plays a critical role in regulating chromatin assembly following DNA
synthesis 1, 2, chromatin disassembly during transcriptional activation 5 and cell survival 1
in yeast. Although H3 K56Ac clearly exists in Drosophila6, 7, it is not known whether these
functions of H3 K56Ac extend to multi-cellular eukaryotes. To investigate the function of
H3 K56Ac in higher eukaryotes (Fig. S1), we asked whether histones carrying K56Ac are
incorporated into chromatin following DNA repair in Drosophila S2 cells using antibodies
specific to H3 K56Ac (Fig. S2). Exposure to hydroxyurea (HU), methyl methane sulfonate

(MMS) or ultraviolet (UV) irradiation increased the level of H3 K56Ac on chromatin in a
dose dependent manner, as determined by western blotting (Fig. 1a; Fig. S3) and
immunofluorescence analyses (Fig. 1b, Fig. S4). Notably, these agents did not result in an
accumulation of cells in S-phase (Fig. S5). Consistent with the requirement for the histone
chaperone Anti-silencing function 1 (Asf1) for H3 K56 acetylation in yeast 8, we found that
Drosophila Asf1 is required for both the endogenous level (Fig. 1c, S6) and the DNA
damage-induced increase in the level (Fig. 1d) of H3 K56Ac in vivo. Strikingly, knockdown
of another histone chaperone, chromatin assembly factor 1 (CAF-1), also drastically
decreased the levels of H3 K56Ac on chromatin (Fig. 1e). However, knockdown of CAF-1,
but not Asf1, resulted in accumulation of H3 K56Ac in the soluble protein fraction (Fig. 1f).
As such, these results demonstrate that Drosophila CAF-1 is required for the assembly of
histones carrying the K56Ac mark into chromatin, while Asf1 is required for H3 K56
acetylation per se. Using Drosophila embryos cycling synchronously between S and M
phase, we detect no apparent difference in the amount of H3 K56Ac present in S or M phase
nuclei (Fig. 1g). During mitosis, the staining of H3 K56Ac closely followed that of the
condensed mitotic chromosomes suggesting that the H3 K56Ac mark is indeed on the
chromatin rather than free in the nucleus. This is in stark contrast to the situation in yeast,
where high levels of H3 K56Ac are only detectable in S-phase 9.

The enzymes that acetylate and deacetylate H3 K56 are unknown in multi-cellular
organisms. Given the structural similarity between the yeast H3 K56 histone acetyl
transferase (HAT) Rtt109 10 and CBP 11, we investigated the potential role of Drosophila
CBP / Nejire 12 in acetylating H3 K56. Treatment of S2 cells with curcumin – an inhibitor
of the CBP/p300 family of HAT proteins 13 – drastically decreased H3 K56Ac levels (Fig.
2a). Furthermore, knockdown of CBP (Fig. 2b, Fig. S6), but not knockdown of another H3specific HAT, Gcn5 14 (Fig. S6), blocked acetylation of H3 K56 in both the absence and
presence of DNA damage (Fig. 2b,c), indicating that CBP is the major H3 K56 acetylase in
Drosophila. Consistent with the idea that Asf1 and CBP function together to acetylate H3
K56 in flies, CBP coimmunoprecipitates with Asf1 (Fig. S7). The NAD-dependent histone
deacetylases (HDAC) Hst3 and Hst4 are the major H3 K56Ac HDACs in yeast 15, 16. To
investigate whether an NAD-dependent HDAC mediates H3 K56 deacetylation in
Drosophila, we treated S2 cells with the NAD-dependent HDAC inhibitor nicotinamide 17.
Nicotinamide, but not the related molecule nicotinic acid, resulted in increased H3 K56Ac
levels (Fig. 2d, Fig. S8). Within the six Drosophila NAD-dependent HDACs, Sir2 is the
closest counterpart of yeast Hst3/Hst4. Indeed, knockdown of Drosophila Sir2 greatly
increased the level of H3 K56Ac (Fig. 2e, Fig. S6), indicating that Sir2 deacetylates H3
K56Ac in Drosophila.

Besides one global mass spectrometry study of histone modifications 18, H3 K56Ac has not
previously been reported in human cells. By western blot analysis of chromatinized histones
from HeLa cells, we clearly detected H3 K56Ac in humans (Fig. 3a). The amount of H3
K56Ac in HeLa and S2 cells was similar (Fig. S9), and mass spectrometry analysis
confirmed the existence of H3 K56 acetylation in HeLa cells (Fig. S10). Furthermore, the
amount of H3 K56Ac on chromatin increased in response to gamma-irradiation (IR), in a
dose-dependent manner (Fig. 3a). The clear colocalization of H3 K56Ac and the

phosphorylated histone variant H2AX (H2AXp) following DNA damage indicated that the
assembly of histones carrying H3 K56Ac is enriched at sites of DNA repair (Fig. 3b). The
levels of H3 K56Ac on human chromatin were also increased following UV, MMS and HU
treatment (Fig. 3c). By flow cytometry analysis, we found that even in the absence of DNA
damage, human cells in all stages of the cell cycle have significant H3 K56Ac staining (Fig.
S11).

Consistent with the reduced level of acetylation of H3 K56 in human cells upon curcumin
treatment (Fig. S12), we found that both CBP and p300 contribute to acetylation of H3 K56
in human cells (Fig. 3d, e, Fig. S13). Furthermore, CBP and p300 directly acetylate histone
H3 on lysine 56 in vitro (Fig. 3f, g), with high efficiency as determined by mass
spectrometry analysis (Fig. S13). Acetylation of H3 K56Ac by the yeast HAT Rtt109
requires that histones H3-H4 be pre-bound to the histone chaperone Asf1 19. However, this
is not the case with CBP in vitro, because it efficiently acetylated H3 K56 irrespective of
whether the histones were bound to Asf1 (Fig. 3f). Towards identifying the human HDAC
for H3 K56, we found that treatment of human cells with nicotinamide greatly increased the
level of H3 K56Ac (Fig. 3h), implicating an NAD-dependent HDAC. siRNA knockdown
analyses of SirT1 and SirT2 indicated that both enzymes contribute to deacetylation of H3
K56 in human cells (Fig. 3i). Indeed, both recombinant hSirT2 and hSirT1 deacetylated H3
K56 in vitro, with SirT2 being the more active enzyme (Fig 3j, Fig S14). Treatment of
human cells with sodium butyrate drastically increased H3 K56Ac levels (Fig. S12),
additionally implicating a class I or class II HDAC in H3 K56 deacetylation. Taken together,
these data reveal that human CBP / p300 are the H3 K56 acetylases while hSirT2 and
hSirT1 are H3 K56Ac deacetylases.

Next, we investigated whether either of the two forms of the human Asf1 histone chaperone,
Asf1a and Asf1b, are involved in H3 K56 acetylation. Using yeast strains that express
equivalent levels of human Asf1a, human Asf1b or Drosophila Asf1 in the place of the yeast
Asf1 protein 20, it was apparent that human Asf1a and Drosophila Asf1, but not human
Asf1b, can assist yeast Rtt109 in the acetylation of H3 K56 (Fig. 4a). In agreement,
knockdown of Asf1a decreased the amount of H3 K56Ac in human cells more than
knockdown of Asf1b while the combined knockdown of both Asf1a and Asf1b resulted in
no detectable H3 K56Ac (Fig. 4b). The requirement for human Asf1 for H3 K56 acetylation
in vivo, but not in vitro, indicates that additional constraints exist in vivo. We also found that
human Asf1 is required for the increase in levels of H3 K56Ac on chromatin following
DNA damage, while human CAF-1 is required for the assembly of the H3 K56 acetylated
histones onto DNA (Fig. 4c, d). Further supporting the role of Asf1a versus Asf1b in H3
K56 acetylation, there is a striking correlation between levels of H3 K56 acetylation and
Asf1a but not Asf1b in a wide variety of normal and cancerous human tissues (Fig. 4e). The
increase in levels of H3 K56Ac in many cancer tissues (Fig. 4e, Fig. S15, Fig. S16) in a
manner that is proportional to tumor grade (Fig. S17, Table S1) led us to investigate whether
H3 K56Ac levels correlate with proliferation and / or tumorigenicity. Non-tumorigenic
MCF10A cells show much lower levels of H3 K56Ac than tumorigenic MCF7 cells derived
from the same breast tumor (Fig. 4f). Furthermore, H3 K56Ac staining also occurred in
cancer cells that are not positive for the proliferation marker Ki-67 21 (Fig. 4g). These data

suggest that H3 K56Ac levels correlate with tumorigenicity rather than proliferation.
Consistent with the elevated level of H3 K56Ac in dedifferentiated cancer cells, we also find
that H3 K56Ac levels positively correlate with the undifferentiated nature of cells. For
example, H3 K56Ac levels are higher in embryos than cell lines (Fig. 4h) and the level of
H3 K56Ac rapidly drops upon in vitro differentiation of cell lines (Fig. 4i, Fig. S18).

Recent yeast studies indicate that H3 K56Ac increases the ability of histones to bind to
CAF-1, which subsequently deposits the histones onto newly synthesized DNA 1, 2. This is
likely to also be the case in higher eukaryotes, given that knockdown of CAF-1 blocks
incorporation of H3 K56Ac into chromatin (Fig. 1F, 4D) and that inhibition of Asf1 blocks
DNA replication and chromatin assembly of newly-synthesized DNA 22–24. In agreement,
CBP/p300 promote DNA replication and cell proliferation 2526. Furthermore, p300 is
recruited to sites of DNA synthesis via its interaction with PCNA 27, consistent with a direct
role for CBP/p300 in promoting chromatin assembly via K56 acetylation after DNA
synthesis. It is also intriguing that the HAT activity of human CBP is highest at the G1/S
boundary - the time at which massive amounts of newly-synthesized H3 is produced to
assemble the newly-replicated genomes into chromatin 28. We propose that the CBP/p300mediated acetylation of H3 K56 promotes the subsequent assembly of newly-synthesized
DNA into chromatin in higher eukaryotes (Fig. S1); the inhibition of which negatively feeds
back to block DNA replication and cell proliferation. Given that the H3 K56Ac mark is
rapidly removed by histone deacetylases after histone incorporation onto newly-replicated
DNA in yeast 15, 16, it will be interesting to determine whether the H3 K56ac deacetylation
process is defective in undifferentiated and dedifferentiated cancer cells. Alternatively, the
elevated levels of H3 K56Ac in cancer cells and undifferentiated cells may reflect
hyperdynamic exchange of histones 29 in undifferentiated cells that is lost upon
differentiation.

NP40-induced extraction of detergent soluble proteins was performed as described
elsewhere 33. Briefly, following treatment with 0.1 or 0.5% NP40, for 10 mins,
centrifugation at 3000 rpm for 10 mins lead to the separation of non-chromatin supernatant
and chromatin pellet fractions. The pellet fractions were subsequently purified and analyzed
by western blotting for the presence of H3K56Ac. Sup (non-chromatin) and pellet
(chromatin) fractions were resolved following 0.1% NP40 treatment as mentioned elsewhere
34.
Isolation of histones from drosophila embryos

Liquid Chromatography – tandem mass spectrometry data acquisition—
Digests were analyzed on a LTQ-ICR hybrid mass spectrometer (LTQ-FT Ultra, Thermo
Fisher, San Jose, CA). Peptide desalting and separation was achieved using a dual capillary/
nano pump HPLC system (Agilent 1200, Palo Alto, CA). On this system 8 µL of sample was
loaded onto a trapping column (ZORBAX 300SB-C18, dimensions 5×0.3 mm 5 µm; Agilent
Technologies, Santa Clara, CA) and washed with 5% ACN, 0.1% FA at a flow rate of 15
µL/min for 5 minutes. At this time the trapping column was put online with the nano-pump
at a flow rate of 350 nL/min. An 80 minute gradient from 8% ACN to 32%ACN was used to
separate the peptides. The column was made from an in-house pulled 360/100 nm (outer/
inner diameter) fused silica capillary using a model P-2000 laser puller (Sutter Instrument
Co.; Novato, CA). The column was packed 15 cm in length with Jupiter C18 resin
(Penomenex; Torrance, CA). The column was kept at a constant 40°C using an in-house
built column heater. The column effluent was coupled directly to the mass spectrometer with
an in-house built nanospray ion source. Data acquisition was performed using the instrument
supplied Xcalibur (version 2.0.7) software. The 90 minute LC runs were monitored by
sequentially recording the precursor scan (MS) followed by three collision-induced
dissociation (CID) acquisitions (MS/MS). Normalized collision energies were employed
using helium as the collision gas. MS survey scans were acquired in the ICR cell at a
resolution of 25,000 at 400 m/z. After two acquisitions of a given ion within 45 seconds, the
ion was excluded for 150 seconds.

Data analysis—The manufacture supplied extract_msn script was used to create deisotoped, centroided peak lists from the raw spectra (.mgf format). These peak lists were
searched against the SwissProt database (v54.8) using Mascot™ server (Version 2.2, Matrix
Science). For searches mass tolerances were +/− 10 ppm for MS peaks, and +/− 0.6 Da for
MS/MS fragment ions. Trypsin specificity was used allowing for 1 missed cleavage. The
modifications of Met oxidation, protein N-terminal acetylation, peptide N-terminal
pyroglutamic acid formation (Q), lysine acetylation and lysine mono-, di- and trimethylation were allowed for. Peptides were required to reach a score of 6 and proteins were
filtered at a significance of P<0.005 and requiring bold red hits (top match for a given
spectrum).

Semiquatitation of K56 acetylation—The tryptic peptide resulting from the
unacetylated K56 form of H3 was “K.STELLIR.K”. This peptide was compared to the
tryptic peptide resulting from the K56 acetylated form of H3 “R.YQ-AcK-STELLIR.K”.
Trypsin cleavage does not occur on the C-terminal side of acetylated K56 due to the loss of
the positive charge. Extracted ion chromatograms were calculated for the range m/z 416.23–
416.27 for the “STELLIR” peptide. It was confirmed that the peak from ~27–30 minutes
corresponded to the “STELLIR” peptide, based on assignment of several CID spectra.
Likewise the extracted ion chromatogram from 646.81–646.91 was used to calculate the
acetylated form of the peptide. The identification of this peak was also confirmed by several
redundant CID spectra. Peak areas were calculated using the “Genesis” Algorithm from
within the Bioworks Qual Browser (version 2.0, Thermo Fisher). The data is stated as the
percentage of K56Ac with respect to total K56 and K56Ac.[A1] While this isn’t a direct
measure of percentage acetylation it does show that K56Ac increases and accordingly K56
decreases. Note that our analyses do not distinguish among the three different histone
variants: H3.3 vs H3.1 vs H3.2.

Verification of H3 K56 acetylation rather than H3 K56 trimethylation—Note that
we can readily distinguish the acetylated lysine 56 and trimethylated lysine 56 by mass
using our analytical platform. The mass difference between acetylation (H2C2O, 42.01056
Da) and tri-methylation (H6C3, 42.04695 Da) of the peptide in question can readily be
distinguished using the FT-ICR instrument where we routinely measure ions at less than 1
ppm mass accuracy. The average parent ion error for H3 was −0.66 ppm and 3*StdDev (3σ)
of all the assigned peptides was 1.26 ppm. The mass error for the ion used to assign
YQK(Ac)STELLIR from the in vitro derived sample had a mass error of −0.74 ppm whereas
the mass error for the tri-methylated form would have been −28.9 ppm; well outside the
acceptable error tolerance for the mass spectrometer used and observed for the rest of the
peptide assignments. Similarly the mass error for assignment of the peptide
YQK(Ac)STELLIR from the in vivo samples was −1.7 ppm, and the error if this precursor
would be assigned as the tri-methylated form would be an unacceptable −29.8 ppm.
