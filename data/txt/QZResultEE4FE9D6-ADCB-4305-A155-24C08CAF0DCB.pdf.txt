BACKGROUND. Bortezomib is active in heavily pretreated multiple myeloma
patients; the dose-limiting toxicity is peripheral neuropathy (PN).

METHODS. The authors retrospectively reviewed the incidence, severity, and risk
factors for PN in 78 patients who received bortezomib. The median age was
57 years (range, 33–80 years), 62% of patients were men, and 37% of patients were
African Americans. Seventeen patients (22%) had diabetes mellitus (DM), and 66
patients (85%) had received thalidomide. Before bortezomib treatment, 37% of
the patients reported subjective, grade 1 or 2 PN. Patients received bortezomib
alone (n 5 10 patients) plus dexamethasone (n 5 36 patients) and thalidomide
(n 5 20 patients) or chemotherapy (n 5 12 patients). PN affected 52% of

patients, including grade 3 and 4 PN in 15% and 7%, respectively.

RESULTS. Twelve patients stopped bortezomib because of side effects that
included PN (n 5 9 patients), diarrhea (n 5 2 patients) and cytomegalovirus
pneumonia (n 5 1 patient); 11 patients had dose reductions because of PN.
Grade 4 PN affected 6 patients (sensory, n 5 4 patients; motor/sensory, n 5 2
patients). The onset of grade 4 PN was sudden rather than cumulative. Factors
that were predictive of PN grade were baseline PN (P 5 .002), prior thalidomide
use (P 5 .03), and the presence of DM (P 5 .03). Multiple myeloma responses
included complete, near complete, and partial responses in 5% of patients, 10%
of patients, and 27% of patients, respectively. Responses were independent of PN
and of whether bortezomib was combined with chemotherapy or thalidomide.
Patients remained on therapy longer for a median of 5 cycles (range, 2–36 cycles)
when they received bortezomib plus thalidomide versus 3 cycles (range, 1–19
cycles) for the other combinations. PN therapy was mostly supportive. It was
noteworthy that 6 of 9 patients with PN who received lenalidomide as salvage
therapy after bortezomib had significant improvement in their symptoms.

CONCLUSIONS. The risk of bortezomib-related PN was greater in patients who
had PN and DM at baseline. The authors concluded that an unexpected, symptomatic improvement of PN on lenalidomide is worth further investigation. Cancer

he proteosome inhibitor bortezomib has demonstrated clinical
activity in patients with recurrent and newly diagnosed multiple
myeloma (MM).1 Common adverse events with bortezomib included
gastrointestinal symptoms, thrombocytopenia, postural hypotension,
and neuropathy. Peripheral neuropathy (PN) is the main dose-limiting
toxicity associated with bortezomib therapy, and grade 1 or 2 PN
affects approximately 33% of patients who receive therapy.2 In the
SUMMIT and CREST Phase II trials, of 256 patients, 35% developed

PN, including 13% grade 3 PN, and only 1 patient
had grade 4 PN. Dose reductions were required in
12% of patients, with 5% discontinuing bortezomib
because of PN; of these, 71% had improvement of
PN at a median of 47 days (range, 1–529 days) after
the last dose of bortezomib.3
The characteristics of PN in bortezomib-treated
patients have not been defined fully. It seems to be
length-dependent and primarily sensory rather than
motor, resulting from axonal degeneration.4,5 On
examination, patients present with reduced ankle
reflexes, decreased vibration sensation, and impaired
heel-to-toe gait. Most PN is dose-dependent, and PN
symptoms improve or stabilize after patients stop or
decrease the dose of bortezomib.6 Some patients
with more severe symptoms benefit from the use of
analgesics and/or antidepressant drugs, such as amitriptylline; serotonin/norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, such as duloxetine; and anticonvulsant drugs,
such as gabapentin.7
At our center, we have treated 78 MM patients
with bortezomib alone or in combination with dexamethasone, thalidomide, and/or chemotherapy. The
main objective of this study was to assess the occurrence of and risk factors for PN in patients with recurrent and/or refractory MM who were treated with
various bortezomib combinations. The study had
many limitations, including the retrospective grading
of PN; the lack of neurologic assessment, except in
few patients with grade 3 or 4 PN; and the heterogeneous bortezomib combinations that were used.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Methods
The current study included patients with MM who
received at least 1 cycle of bortezomib at the Marlene
and Stewart Greenebaum Cancer Center from August
2003 to August 2005. The Institutional Review Board
at the University of Maryland approved the study
and granted a waiver to conduct a retrospective chart
review. The following data were collected for each
patient: demographics, MM isotype, and disease status (newly diagnosed vs recurrent). PN was graded
retrospectively by using the Common Toxicity Criteria (CTC) for Adverse Events (version 3.0) from a
review of patient symptoms (sensory, autonomic,
and motor changes) and physician documentation of
grade or any interference with activity of daily living
and functional impairment as well as the need for
analgesics and other medications to control PN
symptoms. Prior use of neurotoxic drugs, such as
vincristine, cisplatin, and thalidomide, and any his-

tory of diabetes mellitus (DM) or renal insufficiency
were documented for each patient.

Statistical Analysis
The multivariate nominal logistic regression model
was applied to assess whether the DM status, prior
thalidomide administration, presence of hypertension, and number of cycles were contributing factors
to a higher neuropathy grade. The exact Fisher-Freeman-Halton test was used to estimate associations
between neuropathy grade and several plausible risk
factors, ie, age, sex, race, renal status, presence of diabetes, and prior treatment with thalidomide. The
Spearman correlation coefficient was calculated to
assess correlations between variables. All statistical
tests were 2-sided and were done at the .05 level of
significance.

33–80 years). Twenty-nine patients (37%) were African Americans. Twelve patients were newly diagnosed: They received bortezomib in combination
with chemotherapy for cytoreduction and stem cell
collection. The details of treatment for these patients
have been published previously.8 Eighty-five percent
of patients had recurrent MM and had received a
median of 4 prior regimens (range, 2–8 prior regimens). Eighty-five percent of patients received thalidomide as salvage for recurrent disease or as
maintenance after stem cell transplantation. At the
start of bortezomib therapy, 14 patients (18%) had
creatinine levels 2 mg/dL, and 2 patients were on
hemodialysis. Of 78 patients, 72 had adequate data
to assess hypertension and DM, which were confirmed in 39 patients and 17 patients, respectively.

Therapy
Patients received bortezomib at a dose of 1.3 mg/m2
on Days 1, 4, 8, and 11 either alone (n 5 10 patients)
or in combination with dexamethasone (n 5 36
patients) at doses from 20 to 40 mg on the day of
bortezomib and thalidomide (n 5 20 patients) at
doses from 100 to 200 mg daily, as tolerated. Bortezomib in combination with chemotherapy was given
to newly diagnosed patients (n 5 12), including cisplatin 10 mg/m2, doxorubicin 10 mg/m2, cyclophosphamide 400 mg/m2, and etoposide 40 mg/m2 per

day as a continuous intravenous infusion on Days 1
through 4 with oral dexamethasone 40 mg on Days 1
through 4, thalidomide 200 mg on Days 1 through 8,
and bortezomib from 0.7 to 1.3 mg/m2 on Days 1, 4,
and 8. Twelve patients stopped bortezomib because
of side effects, which included PN (n 5 9 patients),
diarrhea (n 5 2 patients), and cytomegalovirus pneumonia (n 5 1 patient). Eleven patients required dose
reductions because of PN symptoms (1 mg/m2,
n 5 5 patients; 0.7 mg/m2, n 5 6 patients). Less frequent infusions (weekly 3 3 with 3 weeks of rest) were
given to responding patients who had grade 2 PN
(n 5 5 patients).

Neuropathy Incidence and Grade
Before bortezomib treatment, 29 patients (37%)
reported subjective, grade 1 or 2 PN grade, and 1
patient reported grade 3 PN. After bortezomib, grade
2 PN affected 52% of patients, including grade 3
and 4 PN in 15% and 7%, respectively (Table 2).
Grade 4 PN affected 6 patients and was sensory PN
in 4 patients and sensory/motor in 2 patients. Four
of those patients were African Americans, 3 had DM,
and 2 had creatinine levels >2 mg/dL. Details of
these 6 patients are outlined in Table 3. The onset of
grade 4 PN was acute rather than gradual, like what
was observed with less severe PN grades. One patient
(Patient 6 in Table 3) had sequential electroneuromyographic studies for PN during therapy with thalidomide and later with bortezomib. Thalidomide was
associated with diffuse, axonal PN in the upper and
lower extremities. Conversely, bortezomib resulted in
severe motor weakness and muscle atrophy that was
most pronounced in the hands. Nerve-conduction
studies showed evidence of demyelinating neuropathy that was most pronounced in the distribution of
the ulnar nerve.
PN therapy, which mostly was supportive,
included various combinations of narcotics, gabapentin, pregabalin, and antidepressant drugs, such as
amitriptylline or the serotonin/norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor Duloxetine. Symptoms improved over
time in all patients irrespective of therapy, mostly after patients stopped the drug or decreased the dose.
However, the median time to improvement was longer in patients with grade 3 and 4 PN versus patients
with grade 1 and 2 PN (grade 3 and 4 PN: median
time to improvement, 8 months; range, 4–161
months; grade 1 and 2 PN: median time to improvement, 3 or 4 months; range, 2–4 months).

whether bortezomib was given alone or in combination with thalidomide, chemotherapy, or dexamethasone (Table 4). Factors that were predictive of the
occurrence of PN were prior PN (P 5 .03) and the
presence of DM (P 5 .03). Baseline PN correlated
with the grade of bortezomib-related PN (Spearman
correlation coefficient, 0.34; P 5 .002). DM also was a
possible predictor of the grade of PN (marginal statistical significance; P 5 .057).

MM Response
Responses were independent of PN grade and of
whether bortezomib was combined with chemotherapy or thalidomide. Response to therapy included
complete, near complete, and partial responses in
5%, 10%, and 27% of patients, respectively, for an
overall response rate of 42%. There was no response
in 58% of patients (Table 5). The duration of therapy
in responding patients was longer in patients who
received bortezomib combined with thalidomide
(median, 5 cycles; range, 2–36 cycles) versus patients
who received other bortezomib combinations (median, 3 cycles; range, 1–19 cycles), probably because
of less toxicity. In fact, a patient who remained on
bortezomib for 3 years received the drug with thalidomide and dexamethasone.9 It is noteworthy that 2
patients with grade 4 sensory PN (Patients 1 and 3 in
Table 3) had their best response ever after 3 cycles of
bortezomib. Both patients had failed after transplantation and thalidomide-based therapies; 1 patient
remained in continuous complete remission for 24
months with no maintenance therapy. However, it is
worth emphasizing that there was no correlation
between response and severity of PN. Nine patients
who had bortezomib-induced PN (grade 2) and
progressive MM went on to receive lenalidomide. It
is noteworthy that lenalidomide resulted in significant improvement of PN symptoms within 2 weeks
of therapy in 6 patients, including 3 patients who
were able to stop analgesics.

DISCUSSION
Bortezomib has demonstrated significant antitumor
activity as a single agent and in combination with
conventional and novel agents in the treatment of
recurrent and newly diagnosed MM. In general, bortezomib is tolerated well and has manageable side
effects.10 PN is a common problem in patients with
MM, even before they start bortezomib. In the current study, 37% of the patients had at least grade 1
or 2 PN. Other studies have reported a similar baseline PN incidence ranging from 25% to 80% (Table
6). This is explained readily by the use of many neu-

rotoxic agents in MM therapy, such as vincristine,
cisplatin, and thalidomide.11 However, in a recently
study by Borrello et al., a 15% incidence of PN was
reported in patients with newly diagnosed MM prior
to the administration of any therapy, suggesting that
MM may contribute to the development of PN.12
In our current study, the highest risk and grade
of bortezomib neurotoxicity were observed in
patients who had baseline PN secondary to prior thalidomide use and a history of DM. Table 6 lists several studies of bortezomib alone or in combination
with dexamethasone and chemotherapies, such as
liposomal doxorubicin and melphalan. The incidence
of PN appears to be similar. In our study, responding
patients who received bortezomib in combination
with thalidomide remained on therapy longer with
minimal dose reductions. This paradoxical effect of
the combination is puzzling, because both drugs
cause significant PN. Five studies in which bortezomib and thalidomide were combined in patients
with recurrent MM (n 5 3 patients) and newly diagnosed MM (n 5 2 patients) reported no grade 4 PN
and a low incidence of grade 3 PN.12–16 In the study
by Borrello et al., the incidence of grade 3 PN was
the highest (18%) in newly diagnosed patients after
bortezomib/thalidomide therapy; in that study, full
neurologic evaluations, including nerve-conduction
studies and skin biopsies, were performed by neurologists, and PN was graded using the Total Neuropathy Score, a diagnostic tool that combines

symptoms, signs, and nerve-conduction studies, making it difficult to compare with other studies using the
CTC/National Cancer Institute (NCI) toxicity criteria.17
The lower incidence of PN in patients who received
thalidomide and bortezomib in combination may
represent a selection bias. However, it is possible that
the known anti-inflammatory properties of thalidomide, including inhibition of tumor necrosis factor
and angiogenesis, may protect against bortezomibinduced PN. Richardson et al. reported that no grade 3
or 4 PN was observed in a Phase I trial that used bortezomib and lenalidomide.18 This may have been related
to the lower doses of bortezomib that were used in the
study or because lenalidomide, similar to thalidomide,
may provide a protective effect. We also observed an
unexpected, symptomatic improvement of PN in a few
patients who were on lenalidomide, which may have
been caused by the anti-inflammatory properties of
the drug. The cause of PN in patients with MM is
unclear. Metabolic changes, edema compressing the
neurovascular bundle leading to degeneration of the
nerves, autoimmune factors, and inflammation may
exacerbate the nerve injury.19 Bortezomib-induced PN
may be induced by the dysregulation of neurotrophins, because it inhibits the activation of nuclear factor jB, a critical transcription factor for nerve growth
factor-mediated neuron survival. However, the exact
mechanisms underlying bortezomib-induced PN are
under investigation.5,20
Major limitations in our study were the retrospective chart review and the lack of prospective eva-

luation and grading for PN. The degree of PN was dependent on the patients’ reporting, which was quite
unpredictable and depends on the onset and severity
of symptoms. PN that develops with bortezomib therapy primarily is sensory and is characterized by pain,
paresthesias, burning dyesthesias, and numbness,
with the feet affected more often than the hands.
Motor neuropathy is uncommon and probably is
underreported with bortezomib, because pain and
tingling of the extremities may result in limited use,
complicating the detection of pure motor weakness.4
In our experience, neurologic evaluation and electromyographic studies are needed if motor PN is suspected.17 A recent study reported an 8% incidence of
grade 3 and 4 motor PN.21 Version 3.0 of the CTC/NCI
provides a crude measure of PN, because assessments
and grading are dependent on the patient reporting of
symptoms and limitations of daily activity.22 It does
not include pain as a criterion for grading PN. A new
method for assessing PN is needed that is simple, reproducible, and inclusive of patient-reported symptoms as well as physician’s objective findings.23,24
Bortezomib-induced PN is a dose-dependent
phenomenon, and dose reduction can prevent deterioration of symptoms and allow continuation of
therapy at lower doses longer; this is an effective
strategy for controlling the disease, as shown from

the CREST trial, and may be an appropriate option
for responding patients who, after induction, may go
on to receive weekly infusions as maintenance.25–27
Dose reductions and prolonging the duration between infusions are the mainstays of treating PN.
Patients with severe symptoms may benefit from
pharmacologic interventions to control pain, such as
analgesics and tricylic antidepressants, and anticonvulsants, such as gabapentin, amitriptyline, and
duloxetine. Topical application of capsaicin cream
also may be of benefit in selected patients. Vitamin
supplements, such as B6 and L-carnitine, have been
advocated for patients based on limited data,
although our experience has demonstrated no benefit from such combinations (unpublished observation). In fact, several studies have documented that
large doses of pyridoxine (B6) cause injury to the
sensory neurons, especially in the setting of renal
insufficiency and in association with a protein-deficient diet.28–30 The use of high doses of vitamin C to
prevent PN is not recommended, because vitamin C
may affect bortezomib metabolism and inhibit
downstream effects, including intended tumor cytotoxicity and the unintended side effects in normal
tissues.31,32 One group of investigators observed significant improvement in PN symptoms after immunoglobulin infusions, suggesting that there is an

autoimmune component for PN, although these were
preliminary data.33
In conclusion, the highest risk and grade of bortezomib neurotoxicity was observed in patients who
had baseline PN and DM. Responses were independent of PN grade and of whether bortezomib was
combined with chemotherapy or thalidomide. The
duration of therapy in responding patients was longer
in patients who received bortezomib in combination
with thalidomide. Most PN symptoms were reversible
on stopping or reducing bortezomib. There is an
urgent need for new tools to assess PN; adequate
assessment is crucial if therapeutic or prophylactic
interventions are to be used in patients with MM. A
few patients appear to benefit from lenalidomide,
with significant symptomatic improvement of PN, an
observation that is worth further investigation.
