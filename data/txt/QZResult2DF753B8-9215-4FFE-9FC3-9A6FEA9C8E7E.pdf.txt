Abstract
Lymph node metastasis, an early and prognostically important event in the progression of many human
cancers, is associated with expression of VEGF-D. Changes to lymph node vasculature that occur during
malignant progression may create a metastatic niche capable of attracting and supporting tumor cells. In this
study, we sought to characterize molecules expressed in lymph node endothelium that could represent
therapeutic or prognostic targets. Differential mRNA expression proﬁling of endothelial cells from lymph nodes
that drained metastatic or nonmetastatic primary tumors revealed genes associated with tumor progression, in
particular bone morphogenetic protein-4 (BMP-4). Metastasis driven by VEGF-D was associated with reduced
BMP-4 expression in high endothelial venules, where BMP-4 loss could remodel the typical high-walled phenotype
to thin-walled vessels. VEGF-D expression was sufﬁcient to suppress proliferation of the more typical BMP-4–
expressing high endothelial venules in favor of remodeled vessels, and mechanistic studies indicated that VEGF
receptor-2 contributed to high endothelial venule proliferation and remodeling. BMP-4 could regulate high
endothelial venule phenotype and cellular function, thereby determining morphology and proliferation responses.
Notably, therapeutic administration of BMP-4 suppressed primary tumor growth, acting both at the level of tumor
cells and tumor stromal cells. Together, our results show that VEGF-D–driven metastasis induces vascular
remodeling in lymph nodes. Furthermore, they implicate BMP-4 as a negative regulator of this process, suggesting
its potential utility as a prognostic marker or antitumor agent. Cancer Res; 71(20); 6547–57. 2011 AACR.

Introduction
Lymphatic dissemination is considered to be an early and
crucial route of metastasis for many cancers (1, 2). Blindending lymphatic capillaries drain ﬂuid, cells, and macromolecules from tissue interstitium into a hierarchy of vessels
punctuated by lymph nodes (LN), which provide immunologic
surveillance for a particular lymphatic drainage basin (3). The

presence of metastatic tumor cells in the "sentinel" LN draining
a tumor site is a key factor in disease management: substantial
clinical data indicates adverse prognostic signiﬁcance of
tumor-positive LNs for many tumor types (4, 5). However, a
clear understanding of the mechanistic role of LNs in tumor
progression is still lacking.
VEGF-D and VEGF-C are important inducers of the growth
and differentiation of blood vessels and lymphatics. When
overexpressed in experimental tumors these growth factors
elicit angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis, and are furthermore associated with increased metastasis to LNs and distant
organs (1). VEGF-D and VEGF-C expression is also associated
with metastasis to LNs in many human cancers, and is independently associated with poor prognosis (6). Recently, it has
emerged that modulation of lymphatics and blood vessels—
including high endothelial venules (HEV), vessels specialized
for leukocyte trafﬁcking (7, 8)—also occurs in draining LNs of
some tumors (9, 10). Such alterations can precede the arrival of
metastatic cells (7, 11–13), and members of the VEGF family
have been implicated in these changes (12–15). The importance of alterations to LN endothelium is highlighted by studies
of human breast cancer: lymphangiogenesis or angiogenesis
within metastatic tumor deposits in sentinel LNs was found to
be associated with, and sometimes independently predictive
of, distant metastasis or survival (9, 16, 17).
Here, we sought to characterize changes to the vasculature
within tumor-draining LNs, to identify molecules with

prognostic or therapeutic potential. We compared the molecular proﬁles of enriched endothelial cell (EC) populations from
LNs draining nonmetastatic tumors with those from LNs
draining metastatic (VEGF-D–overexpressing) tumors. BMP4 was downregulated in the HEVs of LNs draining metastatic
tumors. This observation was linked with the remodeling of
HEVs induced by VEGF-D–driven metastasis, thus implicating
BMP-4 as a regulator of HEV morphology and cell function.
Furthermore, therapeutically applied BMP-4 protein inhibited
primary tumor growth. This study indicates that VEGF-D's
prometastatic activity includes remodeling of specialized LN
endothelium, and identiﬁes new roles for BMP-4 in cancer and
vascular biology.

Materials and Methods
Lists of antibodies, primers and detailed protocols are
contained in the Supplementary Methods section.
Metastatic and nonmetastatic xenograft tumor models
293 EBNA-1 tumor cell lines stably expressing full-length
human VEGF-D (293-VEGF-D), human VEGF-C (293-VEGF-C),
or vector alone (293-Apex) were established in SCID/NOD mice
as described (18). 293 EBNA-1 cells were a gift from Kari Alitalo,
University of Helsinki, Finland. Regular growth and morphology of transfected cell lines was monitored routinely and
growth factor expression veriﬁed by Western blot prior to
each experiment. LNs were analyzed within the timeframe that
metastasis typically occurs in this model; that is, 2 to 4 weeks
postimplantation. All animal experiments were carried out
with the approval of the Institutional Animal Ethics
Committee.
Enrichment of LN EC populations
Draining LNs of metastatic or nonmetastatic tumors pooled
from 1 to 5 mice were enzymatically digested, then tumor cells
and leukocytes were depleted using immunomagnetic selection (Miltenyi Biotec) for class I HLA and CD16/CD32. The
remaining cells were cultured in EGM-2 MV media (Lonza)
before enrichment for ECs by selection for podoplanin (19). See
Supplementary Fig. S1 for detailed procedure.
Microarray analysis
Duplicate samples of LN EC total RNA (RNeasy Plus kit,
Qiagen) were applied to Affymetrix expression arrays (430 2.0;
Australian Genome Research Facility). Raw intensity data were
analyzed using GeneChip Operating Software (Affymetrix), and
proﬁles compared via Robust Multiarray Analysis and linear
modeling using AffylmGUI software (20). Microarray data are
deposited in NCBI's Gene Expression Omnibus; series accession number GSE31123 (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/
query/acc.cgi?acc¼GSE31123).

Hospital, with permission from the Melbourne Health Human
Research Ethics Committee.
Immunostaining and image quantitation
For BMP-4/MECA-79 quantitation, 2 to 3 sections of each
tumor-draining LN (6 per group) were immunostained
(18). For HEV morphometry, the luminal and basal edges
of HEVs were traced using Metamorph Premier (Molecular
Devices), to determine lumen area, average vessel wall width
and endothelial area using Integrated Morphometry Analysis parameters (journal available on request). HEVs with 50%
or more of their circumference staining for BMP-4 were
designated BMP-4high; or otherwise BMP-4low. Data were
analyzed according to a linear mixed model (Supplementary
Methods).
Treatment of ear-draining LNs with recombinant
VEGF-D
One microgram of puriﬁed VEGF-D dimers (0.05 mg/mL;
Vegenics Ltd.) in PBS, or PBS alone as control, was injected
intradermally into the ears of SCID/NOD mice for 3 consecutive days. On day 4, BrdU (Invitrogen) was injected intraperitoneally, and ear-draining (superﬁcial parotid) LNs were
harvested 2 days later.
Treatment of tumors with neutralizing antibodies
Mice bearing metastatic (VEGF-D overexpressing) tumors
received 3 times weekly intraperitoneal injections of neutralizing antibodies (800 mg) to VEGF receptor-2 (VEGFR-2;
DC101; Imclone) or VEGF-D (VD1; ref. 21), or PBS. For analysis
of HEVs, sections of LNs draining nonmetastatic and antibodytreated metastatic tumors were used from one experiment.
LNs of PBS-treated metastatic tumors where HEVs were not
obscured by tumor inﬁltration were included from an identically conducted experiment as a control.
BMP-4 therapeutic model
Tumor-bearing mice were injected intraperitoneally from
day 1, 3 times weekly, with 1.4 mg of human BMP-4 (R&D
Systems) in 200 mL PBS with 0.652 mg/mL BSA, or a vehicle
control of PBS with 0.32 mmol/L HCl and 1 mg/mL BSA,
until day 12 or experiment termination. Serum was sampled
60 minutes posttreatment and BMP-4 quantiﬁed by ELISA
(R&D).
Statistical analysis
Data were compared using a 2-tailed Student t test, or
Fisher's exact test for comparison of proportions. Graphed
data represent mean  SE unless speciﬁed otherwise.

a nonmetastatic control (18). Podoplanin (19) was used as a
highly expressed, protease-resistant selection marker to derive
cell populations enriched for lymphatic ECs and related EC
types, which may respond to VEGF-D (Fig. 1B). Microarray
analysis revealed expression of EC-characteristic genes, including VEGFR-2, neuropilin-1 and neuropilin-2, endothelial nitric
oxide synthase, CD34 and TIE-2; while desmin and calponin-1,
found in ﬁbroblastic lineages, and chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan 4 (NG-2 antigen), characteristic of pericytes, were
absent. These ﬁndings conﬁrmed that the podoplaninþve cells
were enriched for ECs. The LN ECs heterogeneously expressed
ICAM-1 and endoglin, markers of endothelial activation in
inﬂammation and angiogenesis, respectively (Fig. 1C; Supplementary Methods).
Identiﬁcation of endothelial-expressed genes modulated
during metastasis to LNs
LN ECs from metastatic and nonmetastatic tumor models
were compared by microarray (Fig. 2A). Of the top 10 differentially expressed genes (ranked by adjusted P value), 9 were
downregulated in LNs draining metastatic tumors compared
with their nonmetastatic counterparts, and all 10 showed more
than 2-fold difference in expression (Table 1; Fig. 2B). Candidates were subsequently selected for further analysis based on
relevance to endothelial and cancer biology. qRT-PCR validated the downregulation of Bmp4, Unc5c, Cfh, Emcn, and Gpr39 in
ECs from LNs draining metastatic tumors, and the upregulation of Nova1 (Fig. 2C). Bmp4 showed the greatest abundance
and more than 5-fold difference in expression, and was thus
selected for further investigation.

Localization of BMP-4 protein in HEVs and differential
expression in metastasis
Immunohistochemistry showed that BMP-4 protein was
localized to HEVs (Fig. 3A), conﬁrmed by costaining for the
speciﬁc MECA-79 epitope (22). BMP-4 protein was present in a
subset of HEVs in LNs draining both nonmetastatic and
metastatic tumors (Fig. 3A), and in LNs from nontumorbearing SCID/NOD and immunocompetent mice (Fig. 3A, data
not shown). HEVs did not endogenously express podoplanin
(Supplementary Fig. S2), suggesting podoplanin probably
became upregulated in HEV ECs during the brief culturing
between extraction from LN and puriﬁcation for microarray
analysis (23, 24). Although MECA-79 stained the surface of HEV
ECs, BMP-4 seemed primarily in the cytoplasm (Fig. 3A inset),
implying that HEV ECs express BMP-4 protein. No other sites
of BMP-4 localization were observed in the LN or primary
tumor. This supported the conclusion that HEV ECs are the
main source of BMP-4 mRNA and protein in LNs.
Quantitation of staining revealed that HEV-expressed BMP4 was signiﬁcantly reduced (by 50%), in LNs draining metastatic versus nonmetastatic tumors (P < 0.001; Fig. 3B and C).
This illustrated a shift from predominately BMP-4high to predominately BMP-4low HEVs in LNs draining nonmetastatic
versus metastatic tumors respectively; however, both LN types
contained some BMP-4high and some BMP-4low HEVs (Fig. 3B
and C). Therefore, the downregulation of BMP-4 mRNA was
reﬂected at the protein level in vivo.

BMP-4 loss marks HEV remodeling in cancer
We examined LNs for evidence of tumor-induced HEV
remodeling (7), and explored whether VEGF-D or BMP-4 was
associated with this process (Fig. 4A). In LNs draining nonmetastatic tumors, BMP-4high HEVs had signiﬁcantly smaller
lumen areas than BMP-4low HEVs (P ¼ 0.0017; Fig. 4B). In LNs
draining metastatic tumors, however, the BMP-4high HEVs
were more dilated than in the nonmetastatic context (P ¼
0.028; Fig. 4B). Signiﬁcantly, BMP-4high HEVs had thicker vessel
walls than BMP-4low HEVs in all LNs (P < 0.001; Fig. 4B),
suggesting that BMP-4 expression was closely linked with HEV
morphology. Although the remaining BMP-4high HEVs in LNs
draining metastatic tumors largely retained their greater vessel
wall width, there was a strong trend suggesting reduced width
compared with those in LNs draining nonmetastatic tumors,
indicating that VEGF-D–driven metastasis could affect the

6550

Cancer Res; 71(20) October 15, 2011

endothelial width of BMP-4high HEVs (P ¼ 0.064; Fig. 4B). We
also observed remodeled HEVs in a pilot study of human breast
cancer-associated LNs with or without histologically identiﬁable metastasis (Fig. 4E), conﬁrming its occurrence in human
disease (7).
We next investigated whether HEV remodeling involved EC
proliferation. Interestingly, BMP-4high HEV ECs in LNs draining
metastatic tumors had a signiﬁcantly lower proliferation rate
than those from the nonmetastatic model (P ¼ 0.026; Fig. 4C).
Furthermore, BMP-4low HEV ECs in LNs draining metastatic
tumors had a signiﬁcantly higher proliferation rate than the
BMP-4high HEV ECs (P ¼ 0.015; Fig. 4C). These results indicated
that the proliferation response of HEV ECs to tumor-secreted
VEGF-D may be modulated by BMP-4; another way in which
VEGF-D–driven metastasis may induce remodeling of HEV
characteristics via reduction of BMP-4 expression.
The role of VEGF-D and VEGFR-2 in HEV remodeling
To determine whether HEVs could respond directly to
tumor-secreted human VEGF-D, we examined VEGFR-2 and
VEGFR-3 expression in LNs. VEGFR-2 was expressed on most
HEVs, blood vessel capillaries and lymphatics (Fig. 4D).
VEGFR-3 was strongly expressed on lymphatics, but was
essentially absent from HEVs. Thus HEVs are capable of
responding to VEGFR-2 ligands.
In vivo approaches were utilized to investigate the speciﬁc
pathways controlling HEV remodeling. Injection of VEGF-D
into the mouse ear mimics tumor-secreted growth factor
draining to regional LNs. After 3 days of VEGF-D treatment,
proliferation of BMP-4high HEV ECs was decreased (P ¼
0.034; Fig. 5A), suggesting VEGF-D was responsible for the
effect observed in tumor-draining LNs (Fig. 4C), and that
suppression of proliferation in BMP-4high HEVs by VEGF-D
may occur early in the metastatic process. Alteration of lumen
area, vessel wall width and BMP-4 expression may require a
longer stimulation period as neither was affected in this
experiment (Fig. 5A and B); however, BMP-4high HEVs again
exhibited signiﬁcantly thicker vessel walls (Fig. 5A).
In addition, mice bearing metastatic tumors were treated
with neutralizing antibodies to VEGF-D or VEGFR-2. These
antibodies can reduce rates of VEGF-D–driven metastasis to
LNs (M. Matsumoto and colleagues; unpublished data). Anti–
VEGFR-2 treatment of metastatic tumors signiﬁcantly reduced
the lumen area of BMP-4high HEVs (vs. metastatic þ PBS, P ¼
0.039; vs. nonmetastatic tumors, P ¼ 0.049; Fig. 5C). Vessel wall
width of BMP-4high HEVs was again reduced in LNs draining
metastatic tumors (P ¼ 0.019; Fig. 5C). Importantly, both anti–
VEGFR-2 and anti–VEGF-D treatments effectively blocked this
remodeling (P ¼ 0.049 for anti–VEGFR-2 and P ¼ 0.008 for
anti–VEGF-D treatments), returning the vessel wall width to
that of the nonmetastatic control. VEGFR-2 blockade also
increased the vessel wall width of BMP-4low HEVs (vs. metastatic þ PBS, P ¼ 0.007; vs. nonmetastatic, P ¼ 0.053; Fig. 5C),
whereas BMP-4high HEVs still had signiﬁcantly thicker walls
than BMP-4low HEVs in all conditions (P < 0.001). Proliferation
rates of both BMP-4high (P ¼ 0.032) and BMP-4low (P ¼ 0.026)
HEV ECs were reduced by anti–VEGFR-2 treatment, whereas
anti–VEGF-D treatment reduced proliferation of BMP-4low

HEVECs particularly (P ¼ 0.018; Fig. 5C). These analyses
implicate VEGFR-2 in mediating HEV EC dilation and proliferation, and reiterate that BMP-4 expression modulates the
proliferation response of HEV ECs to VEGF-D. Interestingly,
anti–VEGFR-2 treatment did not restore the reduced BMP-4
expression in LNs draining metastatic tumors; in contrast,
BMP-4 expression under anti–VEGF-D treatment was very
close to that of LNs draining nonmetastatic tumors (Fig.
5D). This suggests that VEGF-D may induce BMP-4 downregulation, via a VEGFR-2–independent mechanism.
Effects of exogenous BMP-4 on tumor progression
As this study was designed to identify and analyze molecular
targets with prognostic and/or therapeutic potential, we established a therapeutic model to determine the effects of exogenously-administered BMP-4. Activity and stability of recombinant human BMP-4 were veriﬁed by bioassay (Supplementary Fig. S3A; Supplementary Methods). As shown in Fig. 6A,
BMP-4 inhibited the exponential growth of VEGF-D–overexpressing primary tumors by approximately 50% (day 20, P ¼
0.056; day 22, P ¼ 0.036; day 24, P ¼ 0.080). In addition, similar
tumors overexpressing VEGF-C were reduced in size by
approximately 56% by BMP-4 treatment (day 15, P ¼ 0.067;
day 18, P ¼ 0.021; day 23, P ¼ 0.026). BMP-4 could thus inhibit
tumor growth driven by 2 different lymphangiogenic/angiogenic growth factors. ELISA results conﬁrmed that injected
BMP-4 reached the systemic circulation at approximately
1,200 pg/mL in serum after 60 minutes (Fig. 6B). Interestingly, under the conditions and timecourse of these
experiments the BMP-4 treatment did not seem to affect
metastasis to LNs or HEV morphology (Fig. 6C and data not
shown). Analysis of HEVs did reveal a trend suggesting that
in metastasis-positive LNs draining VEGF-D–overexpressing
tumors, more BMP-4high HEVs were observed under BMP-4
treatment than for the control (mean  SE: BMP-4, 40.9 
10.1; vehicle, 29.5  10.0; n ¼ 5, P ¼ 0.16). Furthermore,
BMP-4high HEVs again exhibited thicker vessel walls than
BMP-4low HEVs in both treatment conditions (P < 0.001;

www.aacrjournals.org

Supplementary Fig. S3B), conﬁrming the importance of
endogenous BMP-4 expression.
Mechanisms of BMP-4–induced tumor growth
suppression
To clarify the mechanism by which BMP-4 suppressed
primary tumor growth, we ﬁrst examined the distribution of
its receptors. BMPs bind a heterodimeric complex of type I and
type II receptors (25). Immunohistochemistry for BMPR-II
revealed broad expression on multiple cell types including
tumor cells, stroma, and endothelium of large blood vessels
(Fig. 6D). Microarray analysis indicated that the VEGF-D–
overexpressing tumor cells expressed BMPR2, as well as
BMPRIA and ACTR1A, but not BMPR1B (Supplementary Table
S2), whereas immunocytochemistry conﬁrmed expression of
BMPR-IA and BMPR-II protein on tumor cells and tumorderived ﬁbroblasts (Supplementary Fig. S4A; Supplementary
Methods). Interestingly, Western blotting revealed that BMPRII protein was more abundant in BMP-4–treated than controltreated VEGF-D–overexpressing metastatic tumors (P ¼ 0.048;
Fig. 6E and Supplementary Methods), potentially representing a feedback loop that could contribute to tumor
suppression.
In vitro stimulation showed that proliferation of VEGF-D–
overexpressing tumor cells was unaffected by BMP-4 (Supplementary Fig. S4B). Conversely, preliminary experiments suggested that 100 ng/mL BMP-4 could induce detectable death in
ﬂow cytometric and microscopy-based assays (6.9%  0.3% vs.
control 4.3%  1.0% 7-aminoactinomycin-D–positive cells, P ¼
0.036; 396  22 vs. control 270  23 propidium iodide-positive
cells/ﬁeld, P ¼ 0.002). Tumor-derived ﬁbroblasts proliferated
signiﬁcantly when stimulated with BMP-4 (Supplementary Fig.
S4C). Interestingly, BMP-4–stimulated human lymphatic ECs
showed increased Ki-67 expression while being slightly
reduced in number, suggesting a short-term apoptosis effect
followed by a slower proliferation response (Supplementary
Fig. S4D). These data collectively suggest that BMP-4–induced
tumor growth suppression is enacted via multiple cell types.

Changes to the blood or lymphatic vasculature in tumordraining LNs have prognostic signiﬁcance in cancer
(9, 16, 17, 26), and may facilitate metastasis (11–13). Understanding the mechanisms and functional consequences of
these alterations will be critical in determining the overall role
of LN metastasis in tumor progression, and could advance
prognostication and treatment for cancer patients. Here, we
have identiﬁed molecules involved in the remodeling of HEVs
in tumor-draining LNs, and an additional role for BMP-4 in
suppressing primary tumor growth.
Microarray analysis of enriched LN EC populations revealed
differential expression of several genes with signiﬁcance to
endothelial and tumor biology. Analysis of isolated EC subtypes has enabled identiﬁcation of important functional
molecules (ref. 27 and manuscript submitted). Although our
isolation strategy utilized podoplanin, commonly used to

distinguish lymphatic endothelium, immunohistochemical
validation revealed BMP-4 to be differentially expressed in
HEVs, a specialized venous endothelial type that did not
express podoplanin in vivo. Subsequent to observations that
blood vascular ECs cocultured with lymphatic ECs could
spontaneously acquire expression of lymphatic-characteristic
molecules including podoplanin (23), it has been shown that
substantial plasticity exists between arterial, venous, and
lymphatic EC lineages, controlled by speciﬁc transcription
factors and reﬂecting their common embryonic origin (24).
Our observations provide further conﬁrmation of this plasticity and relatedness. Another similar study used microarray
analysis of isolated lymphatic ECs from primary tumors, which
were brieﬂy cultured, to identify novel markers with prognostic
signiﬁcance (28). Our study advances upon this by examining
the endothelium of tumor-draining LNs.

VEGF-D–driven metastasis and BMP-4 reduction—that is,

remodeling of the normally "high"-walled HEVs into ﬂat walled,
more dilated vessels with altered proliferation responses—
were consistent with those observed in mouse models and
human breast cancer (7). Other investigators observed suppression of the HEV-expressed lymphotactic chemokine
CCL21 and reduced lymphocyte recruitment in tumor-draining LNs (29). Such physical and molecular features of HEVs
endothelium are integral to their role in trafﬁcking leukocytes
into the LN to facilitate immune responses (8). Although these
investigators analyzed total HEVs, we identiﬁed HEV subtypes
(BMP-4high and BMPlow) which can respond differentially to
tumor-associated stimuli. Although the functional signiﬁcance
of HEV height is poorly understood, ﬂattening of HEV ECs
seems to reduce leukocyte transmigration rates (30). Lower
branching-order HEVs were observed to support lower rates of
lymphocyte adhesion than higher-order HEVs (29); interestingly, in our studies lower-order HEVs tended to have ﬂatter
endothelium and lower BMP-4 expression than higher-order
HEVs. It is possible that HEV remodeling may echo homeostatic differences in the morphologic, molecular, and functional characteristics of different branching-order HEVs. Ultimately, tumor-induced HEV remodeling could assist in generating a
metastatic niche (31): proliferating, dilated blood vessels
derived from remodeled HEVs could enrich the nutrient and
oxygen supply to a LN, whereas impaired immune function

would promote tumor cell survival. The proximity of remodeled HEVs and lymphatic vessels could provide a shortcut for
metastatic cells into the blood vasculature and thus systemic
circulation (31, 32).
Our study provides an important contribution to understanding the molecular mechanisms driving tumor-induced
HEV remodeling (Fig. 5E). The effects of BMP-4 and VEGF-D–
driven metastasis on HEV vessel wall width were strongly
evident, whereas differences in lumen area and proliferation
were more dynamic and may be sensitive to other factors. The
differing impacts of VEGFR-2 and VEGF-D blockade suggest
involvement of another VEGFR-2 ligand. Several studies have
implicated VEGF-A in stimulating HEV growth and remodeling in immune responses (33, 34); thus endogenous VEGF-A
could contribute to VEGFR-2–mediated HEV dilation in
tumor-draining LNs. In addition, VEGF-A might be involved
in the differential proliferative response of BMP-4high and BMP4low HEVs to VEGF-D. BMP-4 can increase expression and
phosphorylation of VEGFR-2 in ECs, thus enhancing responsiveness to autocrine or paracrine VEGF-A (35). BMP-4 itself
could signal to ECs in an autocrine manner (36), and might
upregulate VEGF-A expression by LN stromal cells (34, 37),
thus potentiating a VEGF-A/VEGFR-2 signaling loop. VEGF-D
may then inhibit proliferation of BMP-4high HEV ECs in the
tumor context by competing with VEGF-A for binding to

altering HEV vessel wall width, and the physical presence
of tumor cells in LNs could also affect HEV remodeling.
Notably, the difference in vessel wall width corresponding to BMP-4 expression is larger than that attributable
to VEGF-D and VEGFR-2 blockade in the metastatic
tumor context. BMP-4 may thus act as a key regulator
of HEVs, controlling EC morphology and responsiveness
to angiogenic factors. BMP-4 induces a columnar epithelial phenotype in premalignant Barrett's oesophagus
(38), and could play a similar role in maintaining high
endothelium. Loss of BMP-4 may enable completion of
the remodeling process induced by VEGF-D–driven
metastasis (Fig. 5E). Although the mechanism controlling
BMP-4 expression remains unclear, the restorative effect
of VEGF-D blockade suggests a VEGF-D–driven mechanism independent of VEGFR-2. Lymphatics and HEVs are
regulated in a coordinated manner during immunization
responses, via crosstalk involving lymphotoxin b receptor
(32); similarly, modulation of lymphatics in tumor-draining LNs (e.g., via VEGF-D/VEGFR-3 signaling) may inﬂuence HEV characteristics.

Metastatic (VEGF-D) tumor treatment

As a member of the TGF-b superfamily of multipotent
cytokines, the role of BMP-4 in tumor progression can be
complex and highly context speciﬁc (25, 39). We showed that
while endogenously expressed BMP-4 regulates HEVs, exogenous BMP-4 can restrict primary tumor growth. BMP-4 is also
known to induce apoptosis of other tumor cell lines (40, 41) and
microvascular ECs (42), although in other studies proangiogenic responses were observed, possibly due to potentiation of
VEGF-A/VEGFR-2 signaling (35). Our data suggest that lymphatic ECs may respond to BMP-4 in a similar way. An increase
in proliferation of tumor-derived ﬁbroblasts stimulated with
BMP-4 in vitro is intriguing considering that cancer-associated
ﬁbroblasts are commonly implicated in promoting tumorigenesis (43). The upregulation of BMPR-II expression in BMP-4–
treated tumors recapitulates a similar observation in Xenopus
embryos indicating that Bmpr2 is a target gene of BMP-4
signaling (44). Expression of several other regulators of
BMP-4 signaling is also induced by BMP-4, raising the possibility that blockade of relevant signaling inhibitors might
enhance the efﬁcacy of BMP-4 treatment. Previous in vivo
studies have described antitumorigenic effects of BMP-4 for

several tumor types (40, 45–47)—as well as protumorigenic
effects for some—but thus far only one other study, using a
model of glioblastoma multiforme, has demonstrated an antitumor effect of therapeutically administered recombinant
BMP-4 (48). Although the authors identiﬁed a prodifferentiation effect on tumor stem cells, we noted that VEGF-D is highly
expressed in glioblastoma multiforme (49). Our study adds
weight to the potential of BMP-4 as an antitumor agent by
showing that it can inhibit tumor growth driven by 2 different
lymphangiogenic/angiogenic factors through action on both
tumor cells and stroma.
The context-speciﬁc nature of BMP-4 signaling does compel
careful tuning of BMP-4 targeting and dosage to ensure a
robust antitumor effect. A more constant dosage of BMP-4,
or a delivery system more targeted to the LN, may help clarify
whether therapeutically administered BMP-4 can reverse HEV
remodeling or inhibit metastasis. Nevertheless, reduction of
BMP-4 expression in HEVs is an important early molecular
indicator of remodeling, as it precedes loss of MECA-79 upon
incorporation into the vasculature of the tumor deposit (7).
Clinical studies will establish whether BMP-4 may represent a
convenient surrogate marker of HEV remodeling in cancer.
Furthermore, BMP-4 or HEV remodeling may serve as indicators of systemic or distant effects of prometastatic tumorderived factors such as VEGF-D, and provide prognostic information relevant to metastasis, treatment response, or patient
outcome. Our data further highlight the need to better under-

stand the functional and prognostic signiﬁcance of the LN, and
in particular its vasculature, to cancer metastasis, as well as the
potential of BMP-4 as a multipotent antitumor agent.
