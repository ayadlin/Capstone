Summary
Oestrogen receptor-α (ER) is the defining and driving transcription factor in the majority of breast
cancers and its target genes dictate cell growth and endocrine response, yet genomic
understanding of ER function has been restricted to model systems1-3. We now map genome-wide
ER binding events, by chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by high-throughput sequencing
(ChIP-seq), in primary breast cancers from patients with different clinical outcome and in distant
ER positive (ER+) metastases. We find that drug resistant cancers still have ER-chromatin
occupancy, but that ER binding is a dynamic process, with the acquisition of unique ER binding
regions in tumours from patients that are likely to relapse. The acquired, poor outcome ER
regulatory regions observed in primary tumours reveal gene signatures that predict clinical
outcome in ER+ disease exclusively. We find that the differential ER binding programme
observed in tumours from patients with poor outcome is not due to the selection of a rare
subpopulation of cells, but is due to the FoxA1-mediated reprogramming of ER binding on a rapid
time scale. The parallel redistribution of ER and FoxA1 cis-regulatory elements in drug resistant

cellular contexts is supported by histological co-expression of ER and FoxA1 in metastatic
samples. By establishing transcription factor mapping in primary tumour material, we show that
there is plasticity in ER binding capacity, with distinct combinations of cis-regulatory elements
linked with the different clinical outcomes.

Recent technological advances have allowed mapping of oestrogen receptor-α (ER) binding
events, with the goal of discovering the cis-regulatory elements and factors involved in
mediating ER binding and transcription. Several genome-wide maps of ER in breast cancer
cell line models exist1-3, all showing that most ER binding events occur at distal cisregulatory elements. Forkhead motifs are enriched within the regions bound by ER binding
and numerous studies have identified the forkhead protein FoxA1 as an important pioneer
factor for ER− chromatin interactions4-6. However, the ER mapping studies have been
restricted to breast cancer cell lines, mostly the MCF-7 cell line. We sought to interrogate
ER binding events, for the first time, in primary frozen breast cancer samples, to determine
if ER binding is dynamic and if specific cis-regulatory elements can distinguish tumours
from patients with distinct clinical outcomes.
ER ChIP-sequencing (ChIP-seq) was performed in eight ER+, PR+, HER2− primary breast
tumours, representative of tumours from patients with better prognosis7, a conclusion
supported by the available long-term clinical follow-up (Supplementary figure 1). Also
included were seven primary breast tumours from patients with a poor outcome (ER+ PR−
HER2− or ER+ PR+ HER+), since PR− or HER2+ tumours are more likely to be
aggressive8,9. As expected, the poor outcome patients who had long-term clinical follow-up
died of breast cancer (Supplementary figure 1). Furthermore, three ER+ distant metastatic
samples from women with breast cancer were included. The metastatic locations and sample
preparation can be found in Supplementary figure 1. As a control, we included two breast
cancer samples that were ER− (ER-α negative), but expressed high transcript levels of ERβ.

ER ChIP-seq was conducted and ER binding peaks were called using two different
algorithms, MACS10 and SWEMBL (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/~swilder/SWEMBL/), to
minimise peak caller bias. The number of sequencing reads and ER binding events for each
tumour is shown in Supplementary figure 2. ER binding could be mapped in all tumours, but
total peak intensity and the number of identified binding events differed. Three tumours
were split into two sections and ER ChIP-seq was conducted on the separate sections. We
found very good concordance when comparing different sections of the same tumour (R2 =
0.954) suggesting that tumour heterogeneity did not substantially influence the ER binding
signal obtained from a sample (Supplementary figure 3).
We initially assessed whether a conserved set of breast cancer ER binding events could be
identified. We found a core set of 484 ER binding events that were identified in at least 75%
of all the tumours, but not in either of the ER− tumours (Figure 1A). Peak calling details can
be found in Supplementary figure 4. An example of a core ER binding event is shown in
Figure 1B. This demonstrates that ER binding to chromatin still occurs even in tumours that
are unlikely to respond to antioestrogen therapies, implying that drug resistance is not due to
loss of ER binding to DNA. The average ER binding signal intensity was highest in the
metastatic samples and lowest in patients with good outcome tumours, a phenomenon
observed both within the 484 core ER binding regions (Figure 1C) and globally
(Supplementary figure 4). These data suggest that there is an acquisition of binding signal
intensity in tumours that progress towards a poorer prognosis and ultimately metastasise.
The only DNA motif found enriched in the core ER binding events was an oestrogen
responsive element (ERE) (Figure 1D). The genes near (within 20kb: an optimal window
between ER binding events and target genes11) the 484 core ER binding events exhibited

elevated expression in the ER+ tumours used for ChIP-seq, as compared to all other genes
(data not shown) and were higher in ER+ tumours relative to ER− tumours in nine
independent datasets (Supplementary figure 5). The genes are provided in Supplementary
figure 6 and include classic ER target genes such as TFF1, GREB1 and RARα. A gene
predictor was generated based on genes near the core ER binding events. Patients were
stratified and the tumours with the highest ‘risk index’ had a poor clinical outcome when
compared to the tumours with the lowest ‘risk index’ (Figure 1E shows the results based on
one study12 and additional datasets are shown in Supplementary figure 6. Only ER+ patients
were considered). These conserved cis-regulatory elements and their putative target genes
may be the elements that contribute to tumourigenesis and are maintained regardless of the
clinical outcome of the breast cancer patient. In contrast to the primary breast cancers and
metastases, we mapped ER binding in three normal human mammary glands and two
normal human liver samples and found limited numbers of ER binding events, with almost
no concordance in ER binding between individuals (data not shown).

We sought to determine if differential ER binding events could discriminate the patients
with good outcome (ER+ PR+ HER2− tumours), from patients with poor outcome or
metastases (we described the combined set as poor/met tumours). After normalisation of the
data to account for global differences in ER binding, Differential Binding Analysis (DBA)
was used to identify ER binding events that were statistically enriched in one category or the
other. This resulted in a set of ER binding events that could discriminate between the two
groups when using principal component analysis (Figure 2A). In total, DBA revealed 1,192
genomic regions that had significantly more ER binding in the poor/met group, compared to
the good outcome patients (Figure 2B) and 599 ER binding regions with more ER binding in
the good outcome patients, when compared to the poor/met patients (Figure 2B). The
clustering of the tumours based on the 1,791 differential ER binding events can be visualised
in Supplementary figure 7. These findings suggest that there are specific and re-occurring
cis-regulatory elements that are occupied by ER in breast cancers, but that these are different
in tumours that respond, versus those that relapse and metastasise. Analysis of enriched
DNA motifs identified the presence of ERE and FoxA1 motifs in the differential poor
outcome ER binding events and ERE motifs in the good outcome ER binding events (Figure
2C). Correlation of the poor outcome ER binding events with known processes revealed an
association with endocrine resistance and luminal B status (Supplementary figure 8).
To investigate if the genes near the differential ER binding events were potentially
functional in breast cancer, we analysed genes within a 20 kb window around the 1,192
poor/met and 599 good outcome ER binding events. Using a training set, we generated a
gene expression predictor for each of the good and poor outcome gene lists. The probability
calculation and comparisons between the good and poor outcome genes is shown in
Supplementary figures 9 and 10. Within the poor outcome gene list was the oncogene ErbB2
(all genes are shown in Supplementary figure 11). As expected, genes in the poor outcome
predictor were preferentially up-regulated in poor outcome patients, while those in the good
outcome predictor were preferentially down-regulated (Supplementary figure 10). We next
tested the predictors in an independent large cohort of breast cancer patients12, only
considering ER+ tumours. Using distant metastases free survival as an endpoint, both gene
sets predicted outcome (p = 3 − 10−5 for good and 3 × 10−8 for poor outcome genes) in this
dataset12 and with the expected opposite directionality (Figure 2D). The gene predictors
were associated with survival in additional datasets (Supplementary figure 12) and were
largely independent of histopathological factors (Supplementary figure 13). We tested 1,000
randomisations from the entire list of genes and determined that the probability that a
random set of genes would yield an equally robust predictor of clinical outcome was p =
0.004. Furthermore, the good and poor gene predictors had no predictive power in four
cohorts of ER negative patients (Supplementary figure 14). This suggests that the increased

ER binding at distinct cis-regulatory elements is functionally and biologically relevant,
resulting in altered gene expression profiles that contribute to differences in drug response
and overall survival.

To validate the findings made in the tumours, we explored the possibility that ER binding
events were acquired in cell line models of endocrine resistance. ER binding was mapped by
ChIP-seq in three commonly used tamoxifen-responsive, ER+ breast cancer cell lines
(MCF-7, T-47D and ZR75-1), and two tamoxifen-resistant, ER+, breast cancer cell lines,
namely a tamoxifen-resistant MCF-7 derivative (TAM-R)13 and BT-474 cells that are ER+
and contain the ERBB2 amplification (ER+ HER2+). Similar to BT474 cells, TAM-R cells
have elevated ERBB2 pathways13 and both represent cellular systems where increased
growth factor signalling results in endocrine resistance. For all five cell lines, ER ChIP-seq
was performed in at least duplicate, in asynchronous cells to recapitulate the situation
observed in primary tumours (Supplementary figure 2).
Almost seven thousand (6,920) ER binding events were identified in all replicates of all cell
lines (Figure 3A and Supplementary figure 15). The majority (98.9%) of the core ER
binding events that occurred in most primary tumours (Figure 1A) overlapped with the cell
line core ER binding events. DBA identified 8,188 ER binding events with significantly
stronger binding affinity in the tamoxifen-resistant cell lines and 5,713 ER binding events
that were stronger in the tamoxifen-responsive cell lines (Figure 3A). Examples of
differentially bound regions are shown in Figure 3B. Using the differential ER binding
events, the cell line classification can be visualised in principal component analysis (Figure
3C) and in hierarchical clustering (Figure 3D). Enriched motif analysis revealed ERE and
FoxA1 motifs in regions showing increased ER binding in tamoxifen resistant cell lines
(Figure 3E), which are the same motifs observed in the poor outcome ER binding events in
primary tumours (Figure 2C). GATA motifs were enriched in ER binding events depleted
during acquisition of drug resistance (Figure 3E), possibly due to competition between
FoxA1 and GATA3, another prominent breast cancer transcription factor.

We hypothesised that the ER binding events induced in the tamoxifen-resistant breast cancer
cell lines would be the same regions that were enriched in the poor/met clinical samples.
However, 79.8% of the 1,192 ER binding events enriched in the poor/met samples (from
Figure 2B) overlap with ER binding events in wild type MCF-7 cells, suggesting that the
cell line models are closer to the tumours and metastases from poor outcome patients. In
support of this, the 599 good outcome ER binding event observed in primary tumours
(Figure 2B) overlap poorly with ER binding observed in MCF-7 cells (30.2% versus 79.8%
for the poor outcome). Interestingly, MCF-7 cells (plus T-47D and ZR75-1 cells) are derived
from the pleural effusion of metastatic breast cancer patients, but were established prior to
tamoxifen use in the clinic. We hypothesise that MCF-7, ZR75-1 and T-47D cell lines
possess an intermediate ER binding profile with the acquisition of additional ER binding
regions required for resistance to antioestrogen treatment.
The differences in ER binding between sensitive and resistant contexts may be due to
selection and expansion of a resistant subpopulation, or may be due to reprogramming of ER
binding following specific stimuli. Growth factor pathways have long been implicated in
modulating endocrine response14,15 and have been shown to influence ER binding potential
and gene expression profiles14. We identified various stimuli (EGF, IL-6, TNF-α and IGF-I)
shown to induce increased cellular invasion and drug resistance and treated asynchronous
MCF-7 cells with control or the cocktail of mitogens for 90 minutes (Figure 4A). Duplicate
ER ChIP-seq replicates were performed (Supplementary figure 2).

Differential binding analysis identified 6,089 ER binding regions that were differentially
enriched (≥ 4 fold change difference, FDR < 0.1) following a 90 min treatment with the
cocktail. These mitogen-induced ER binding differences could be visualised using principal
component analysis (Figure 4B). Since FoxA1 is a pioneer factor required for ER-chromatin
interactions4 and FoxA1 motifs were enriched in both the mitogen induced ER binding
events (Supplementary figure 16) and the tumours from the poor outcome patients (Figure
2C), we assessed whether the rapid, reprogrammed ER binding occurred at regions predetermined by FoxA1. We repeated the mitogen treatment, but mapped FoxA1 binding by
ChIP-seq and found that ~25% of the reprogrammed ER binding events (1,515) occur at
regions that are already bound by FoxA1, prior to mitogen treatment (Figure 4C). A
substantial proportion (37.6%) of the other reprogrammed ER binding events occur at
regions where FoxA1 binding is also induced by mitogens. As such, ~53% of mitogeninduced ER binding events occur at regions pre-bound by FoxA1 or at regions that also
acquire FoxA1 binding (Figure 4C), a level of concordance that mirrors the ~50% overlap
observed in wild type cells6.
To determine if FoxA1 expression was present in ER+ distant metastases, we obtained 24
metastatic samples (bone, brain and liver) from ER+ breast cancer patients and performed
immunohistochemistry for ER and FoxA1 (Figure 4D). We found that ~87% of the
metastases retained ER expression and that FoxA1 expression occurred in ~95% of the
metastases (Figure 4E). Importantly, the concordance between ER and FoxA1 was high (R2
= 0.585), regardless of the site of metastasis. Therefore, the co-expression of ER and FoxA1
in distant metastases supports our conclusions that FoxA1 mediates ER reprogramming.

By mapping ER binding in clinical samples, we provide a first glimpse of the primary
regulatory regions that contribute to differences within ER+ breast cancers, rather than
secondary events such as gene expression profiles. Our findings suggest that there is
plasticity in ER binding, with distinct ER binding profiles associated with clinical outcome.
These differential ER binding profiles appear to be mediated by FoxA1. A remaining
question is what dictates differential FoxA1 and subsequently ER binding. Possibilities
include changes in the genomic landscape, alterations in co-factor levels or changes in
FoxA1 structure and function, potentially by post-translational modifications. By
establishing transcription factor mapping in primary samples, we find that differential ER
binding patterns govern gene expression programs and are associated with clinical outcome
in ER+ cancer.

Methods summary
MCF-7, ZR75-1, T-47D and BT-474 human cell lines were obtained from ATCC and grown
in the relevant media. TAM-R cells13 were a kind gift from Dr Iain Hutcheson and Prof.
Robert Nicholson (Cardiff). The ER+ breast cancer tumours were obtained from the
Nottingham Tenovus primary breast cancer series, Addenbrooke’s Hospital and Imperial
College Healthcare NHS Trust, London, UK with appropriate ethical approval from the
repositories. The malignant pericardial effusion and the two distant metastases were
obtained from Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust, London, UK. For ChIP in the
tumours and metastases, the frozen sample was cut into smaller pieces prior to ChIP, which
was then performed as previously described16. For the malignant pericardial effusion,
epithelial cells were first enriched using Dynabeads conjugated with Epcam17. For ChIPs
from cell line material, proliferating cells were cross-linked and processed for ChIP as
previously described16. The antibodies used were anti-ER (sc-543) from Santa Cruz
Biotechnologies and anti-FoxA1 (ab5089) from Abcam. Sequences generated by the
Illumina Genome Analyzer were processed by the Illumina analysis pipeline version 1.6.1,
and aligned to the Human Reference Genome (assembly hg18, NCBI Build 36.1, March

DiffBind package19. For immunohistochemical analyses, ER staining was conducted using
the 6F11/2 mouse monoclonal antibody (Novocastra, Leica Microsystems, Bucks, UK) and
FoxA1 staining was conducted using a rabbit polyclonal antibody (ab23738) from Abcam.
An Allred scoring system was used to assess staining accounting for both staining intensity
and the proportion of cells stained.

and FoxA1 binding after 90 minutes of treatment with the mitogenic cocktail. Also shown is
the normalised average signal intensity of all ER and FoxA1 binding events within the
‘gained’ ER binding events. D. Metastatic samples from different sites were stained by
immunohistochemistry for ER and FoxA1. Example of ER and FoxA1 expression in a breast
cancer bone metastasis. E. Graphical representation of ER and FoxA1 co-expression in
metastases. Location of metastases is provided, as is the Allred score.
