Abstract

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are generated by two-step processing to yield small RNAs that negatively
regulate target gene expression at the post-transcriptional level1. Deregulation of miRNAs has
been linked to diverse pathological processes, including cancer2,3. Recent studies have also
implicated miRNAs in the regulation of cellular response to a spectrum of stresses4, such as
hypoxia, which is frequently encountered in the poorly angiogenic core of a solid tumour5.
However, the upstream regulators of miRNA biogenesis machineries remain obscure, raising the
question of how tumour cells efficiently coordinate and impose specificity on miRNA expression
and function in response to stresses. Here we show that epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR),
which is the product of a well-characterized oncogene in human cancers, suppresses the

maturation of specific tumour-suppressor-like miRNAs in response to hypoxic stress through
phosphorylation of argonaute 2 (AGO2) at Tyr 393. The association between EGFR and AGO2 is
enhanced by hypoxia, leading to elevated AGO2-Y393 phosphorylation, which in turn reduces the
binding of Dicer to AGO2 and inhibits miRNA processing from precursor miRNAs to mature
miRNAs. We also identify a long-loop structure in precursor miRNAs as a critical regulatory
element in phospho-Y393-AGO2-mediated miRNA maturation. Furthermore, AGO2-Y393
phosphorylation mediates EGFR-enhanced cell survival and invasiveness under hypoxia, and
correlates with poorer overall survival in breast cancer patients. Our study reveals a previously
unrecognized function of EGFR in miRNA maturation and demonstrates how EGFR is likely to
function as a regulator of AGO2 through novel post-translational modification. These findings
suggest that modulation of miRNA biogenesis is important for stress response in tumour cells and
has potential clinical implications.

Activated EGFR contained in intracellular vesicles is capable of activating intracellular
signalling pathways before lysosomal degradation6. Importantly, proteins associating with
internalized EGFR probably differ from those transducing signalling at the plasma
membrane7, suggesting a higher degree of signalling complexity that is not well
characterized. We identified AGO2 as a novel EGFR-interacting protein by mass
spectrometric analysis (Supplementary Fig. 1), and validated their association by coimmunoprecipitation and pull-down assays (Supplementary Fig. 2). The juxtamembrane and
kinase domain of EGFR is essential for binding with AGO2 at the aminoterminal region.

Human AGO2 was initially reported as a membrane-associated cytoplasmic protein8 and is
the catalytic centre of RNA-induced silencing complex9 (RISC). AGO2 also associates with
Dicer and TRBP (HIV-1 transactivating response RNA-binding protein, also known as
TARBP2) to form the RISC-loading complex, which is involved in the second step of
miRNA processing from precursor to mature miRNAs10,11. To investigate the physiological
role of EGFR–AGO2 interaction, we screened different upstream EGFR-activating stimuli,
including ligands and stresses12–15, in HTC-1080 stable clone expressing split-half-YFPfused EGFR and AGO2 (EGFR with the N-terminal domain of YFP fused to the C terminus
and AGO2 with C-terminal domain of YFP fused to the C terminus; Supplementary Fig. 3a;
YFP, yellow fluorescent protein), in which the YFP fluorescence can be reconstituted only
on protein–protein association16 (Fig. 1a). Of the four different types of stimuli, hypoxic
stress induced the strongest level of YFP fluorescence (Supplementary Figs 3b, c and 4),
with distinct foci formed in cytoplasm (Fig. 1b), suggesting that internalized EGFR interacts
with AGO2 in aggregates. Dynamic EGFR–AGO2 association was further validated in
HeLa cells and various cancer cell lines by co-immunoprecipitation (Fig. 1c and
Supplementary Fig. 5) and co-localization assays (Supplementary Figs 6 and 7), and was
found to be RNase resistant (Supplementary Fig. 8), indicating that EGFR and AGO2 are
direct physical interacting partners in vivo.
Hypoxia is known to upregulate EGFR14 and prolong its activation through retention in
endocytic trafficking13. Indeed, hypoxia enhanced EGFR expression in late endosomes
(multivesicular bodies; Supplementary Fig. 9, F2–F4), where it co-localized with AGO2
(Supplementary Fig. 10 and Fig. 1d) and co-fractionated (Supplementary Fig. 9) with RISC
components (AGO2, DCP1A and GW182) as well as the RISC-loading complex (Dicer,
TRBP and AGO2). Silencing GRB2, a key modulator of EGFR endocytosis17, diminished
EGFR–AGO2 interaction (Supplementary Fig. 11), highlighting the importance of
internalization. Furthermore, inhibition or silencing of hypoxia-inducible transcriptional
factors18 (HIF1α (HIF1A) and HIF2α (EPAS1)) reduced EGFR–AGO2 association
(Supplementary Fig. 12a and Fig. 1e) and co-localization (Supplementary Figs 12b and 13)
under hypoxia, and stabilization of HIF1α and HIF2α (HIF1/2α) triggered the interaction of

EGFR and AGO2 under normoxia (Supplementary Fig. 14). Nonetheless, EGFR–AGO2
association in RCC4 cells (endogenous VHL null with constitutively expressed HIF1/2α)
was further strengthened by hypoxia regardless of the exogenous expression of wild-type
VHL (Supplementary Fig. 15). These results indicate that stable expression of HIF1/2α is
sufficient to trigger EGFR–AGO2 interaction that is further enhanced by hypoxia, probably
through an HIF1/2α-independent mechanism.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

To assess the functional importance of EGFR–AGO2 interaction in miRNA regulation, we
profiled RNA expression in HeLa stable clones expressing scrambled control or short
hairpin RNA (shRNA) against EGFR under normoxia or hypoxia by RNA deep sequencing
(Supplementary Figs 16a and 17). Hierarchical clustering analysis of relative expression of
precursor and mature miRNAs (scrambled versus shRNA against EGFR; Supplementary
Fig. 16b) identified one distinct cluster of miRNAs under hypoxia (Fig. 2a, dashed box). In
the presence of EGFR, the level of precursor miRNAs increased with a concomitant
decrease in the expression of mature miRNAs. However, the maturation of this cluster of
miRNAs was not significantly altered by EGFR under normoxia (Fig. 2a), implying that
their processing from precursor to mature miRNAs was negatively regulated by EGFR
specifically in response to hypoxia. We defined this subcluster of miRNAs as mHESM
(miRNAs regulated by hypoxia-dependent EGFR-suppressed maturation). We then pooled
mHESM and narrowed down the candidates on the basis of their absolute mature miRNA
expression affected by EGFR knockdown. A majority of the top-scoring mHESM turned out
to have tumour suppressor characteristics3,4,19–21 (Fig. 2a).
To determine the functional relevance of mHESM, messenger RNAs (mRNAs) regulated by
EGFR were sorted and overlapped with the predicted mRNA targets of top-scoring
mHESM, revealing 439 mRNAs (Supplementary Data) that are regulated by EGFR and also
targeted by top-scoring mHESM (Fig. 2b). In response to hypoxia, EGFR reduced the
production of mHESM but enhanced the expression of corresponding mRNA targets (Fig.
2b), which is evidence of the importance of EGFR-modulated miRNA maturation. The
inhibitory role of EGFR in miRNA maturation in response to hypoxia was further validated
in HeLa stable transfectants expressing scrambled control or shRNAs targeting EGFR
(Supplementary Fig. 19) by quantitative PCR. Moreover, induction of wild-type but not
kinase-dead EGFR in HeLa Tet-Off-inducible stable clones (Supplementary Fig. 20a)
inhibited the maturation of top-scoring mHESM in response to hypoxia (Supplementary Figs
20b,c), suggesting that EGFR kinase activity is important for EGFR-suppressed miRNA
maturation.

To investigate whether AGO2 is a phosphorylation substrate of EGFR, we purified FLAGtagged AGO2 co-expressed with EGFR and identified one Tyr phosphorylation site
(Supplementary Fig. 21) at a highly conserved residue, Tyr 393 (Supplementary Fig. 22), in
AGO2. Results from in vitro kinase assay (Fig. 3a) further demonstrated AGO2-Y393 to be
a direct phosphorylation site targeted by EGFR. Mutational analysis suggested that phosphoY393-AGO2 exists in vivo (Supplementary Figs 23 and 24), and this was validated in HeLa
Tet-Off-inducible AGO2 stable clones (Supplementary Fig. 25a and Fig. 3b) using the
polyclonal antibody (p-Y393-AGO2) we generated (Supplementary Fig. 26). Notably,
hypoxia enhanced AGO2-Y393 phosphorylation (Fig. 3b), which in turn reduced the
association of AGO2 with Dicer and TRBP (Fig. 3b and Supplementary Figs 23 and 24),
suggesting that EGFR is a novel upstream regulator of the RISC-loading complex.
To gain more insight into phospho-Y393-AGO2, we analysed the crystal structure of AGO2
(refs 22 and 23) and found that the side chain of Tyr 393 protrudes with an exterior
orientation towards a cavity between the N domain (an interaction surface for EGFR) and
the linker L2 (a linker domain between PAZ and MID) (Fig. 3c). Tyr 393 is exposed to

solvent and is some distance from both the guide RNA-binding channel and the PIWI box, a
Dicer-binding region of AGO2 (ref. 24). Given that Dicer is a large protein, it is conceivable
that Dicer could still interact with both the Dicer-specific PIWI box and Tyr 393 owing to
their location on the same surface of AGO2 (Fig. 3c). If so, phosphorylation of Tyr 393
could inhibit this interaction as previously observed (Fig. 3b and Supplementary Figs 23 and
24).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

The recruitment of AGO2 to Dicer is critical for loading miRNA precursors onto the RISCloading complex25 and facilitating miRNA maturation11,25 from precursor to mature
miRNAs. We therefore investigated whether AGO2-Y393 phosphorylation has a role in
EGFR-suppressed miRNA maturation in response to hypoxia. Compared with an AGO2Y393F mutant, induction of wild-type AGO2 (AGO2-WT) significantly reduced the
expression of most mHESM but not those that do not belong to the mHESM cluster (defined
as non-mHESM) in response to hypoxia (Supplementary Fig. 25b). Structural analysis of
miRNA precursors determined that a majority of mHESM regulated by p-Y393-AGO2
contained a long-loop structure, which is not present in non-mHESM (Supplementary Fig.
25b). Notably, mHESM that were not significantly affected by AGO2-Y393
phosphorylation also had short-loop structures in their precursors, similar to what we found
in non-mHESM (Supplementary Fig. 25b). This suggests that long-loop structure is
important in regulation specificity. Similar expression patterns of mature miRNAs were
observed in other paired stable clones (Supplementary Figs 27 and 28).
Silencing endogenous EGFR significantly diminished the expression difference of long-loop
mHESM present in miR-31, miR-192 and miR-193a-5p between AGO2-WT and AGO2Y393F mutant cells (Supplementary Fig. 29). The levels of their primary transcripts were
reduced by EGFR knockdown under hypoxia but were similar in AGO2-WT and AGO2Y393F cells (Supplementary Fig. 29b). This is evidence that EGFR is a tyrosine kinase that
mediates phospho-Y393-AGO2-suppressed miRNA maturation under hypoxia. Moreover,
decreased expression of long-loop mHESM as shown in miR-31, miR-192 and miR-193a-5p
under hypoxia resulted in the de-repression of miRNA targets (Fig. 3d) as measured by miRreporter luciferase activity. In contrast, the expression of miR-21 (non-mHESM) and the
repression of its target were not significantly affected by AGO2-Y393 phosphorylation (Fig.
3d). These results underline the functional importance of p-Y393-AGO2-mediated
suppression of long-loop mHESM under hypoxia.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

The long-loop structure in miRNA precursors is a known characteristic of Dicer’s
preference in substrate recognition26. Reduction in the Dicer–AGO2 interaction resulted in
less loading of the precursors of miR-31, miR-192 and miR-193a-5p (long-loop mHESM),
but not that of miR-21 (short-loop non-mHESM), onto p-Y393-AGO2 under hypoxia
(Supplementary Fig. 30). To examine the functional relevance of decreased Dicer–phosphoAGO2 association, we knocked down Dicer in HeLa Tet-Off-inducible AGO2 stable clones
(Supplementary Fig. 31a, b and Fig. 3e) and found that the differences between AGO2-WT
and AGO2-Y393F in miRNA precursor loading (Fig. 3e) and mature miRNA expression
(Supplementary Fig. 31c) were significantly diminished. These results suggest that the
maturation of long-loop mHESM is suppressed by AGO2-Y393 phosphorylation through
Dicer. Moreover, AGO2-Y393F was capable of loading more mature mHESM (Fig. 3e),
which is consistent with its enhanced RISC activity as indicated by luciferase reporter assay
(Fig. 3d). However, the mature miRNA loading difference between AGO2-WT and AGO2Y393F was Dicer dependent (Fig. 3e), and similar to what we observed in mature miRNA
expression (Supplementary Fig. 31c). These data suggest that AGO2-Y393 phosphorylation
decreases Dicer–AGO2 interaction, which in turn reduces miRNA precursor loading,
suppresses the maturation of long-loop mHESM and decreases the loading of corresponding
mature miRNAs onto RISC under hypoxia.

To demonstrate that the long-loop structure of precursor miRNAs indeed serves as one of
the determinants that distinguish mHESM that are regulated by p-Y393-AGO2 from other
miRNAs that are not, we mutated pre-miR-192-WT (long loop) into pre-miR-192-3M (short
loop) and stably expressed them in HeLa Tet-Off-inducible AGO2 stable clones (Fig. 3f,
top). Compared with AGO2-Y393F mutant, induction of AGO2-WT attenuated the
maturation of pre-miR-192-WT but not pre-miR-192-3M, which virtually lost its processing
efficacy without the long-loop structure (Fig. 3f and Supplementary Fig. 32). Conversely,
AGO2-WT was able to suppress pre-miR-21-3M with a regenerated long-loop structure
(Fig. 3g and Supplementary Fig. 33) that is not present in miR-21-WT (Fig. 3g and
Supplementary Fig. 34). These results support a long-loop-dependent mechanism by which
p-Y393-AGO2 confers regulation specificity on miRNA maturation.

The hypoxic tumour microenvironment promotes the metastatic phenotype by facilitating
tumour cell survival through evasion of apoptosis18. Given that most mHESM suppressed
by p-Y393-AGO2 are tumour-suppressor-like (Supplementary Figs 18 and 25b), we further
investigated the pathophysiological role of AGO2 phosphorylation in response to hypoxia.
Compared with vector control and AGO2-WT, a higher proportion of cells expressing
AGO2-Y393F mutant underwent apoptosis following hypoxia exposure for three days
(Supplementary Fig. 35), indicating that they were more susceptible to hypoxic stress.
Knockdown of endogenous EGFR reduced cell survival and diminished the differences in
apoptosis between AGO2-WT and AGO2-Y393F stable transfectants (Fig. 4a), suggesting
that the phosphorylation of AGO2, rather than the mutation itself, is critical for cell survival
under hypoxia. We did not observe any significant changes between AGO2-WT and AGO2Y393F mutant in cell proliferation rate (Supplementary Fig. 36a, b) or anchorageindependent growth (Supplementary Fig. 36c, d). Notably, AGO2-WT but not AGO2Y393F mutant significantly increased cell migration in response to hypoxia (Fig. 4b and
Supplementary Figs 37 and 38). Treatment with Tyr-kinase inhibitor abrogated AGO2-WTenhanced migration but failed to inhibit AGO2-Y393F mutant cells, indicating that AGO2Y393 phosphorylation is important for EGFR-enhanced cell migration under hypoxia.
Similar results were obtained from three-dimensional invasion assay with or without Tyrkinase inhibitor treatment (Fig. 4c and Supplementary Fig. 39). These results demonstrate
the functional importance of AGO2-Y393 phosphorylation in blocking cell apoptosis and
enhancing cell invasiveness under hypoxia.

Finally, we used an orthotopic xenograft breast cancer model to establish the relationship
between hypoxia, EGFR and p-Y393-AGO2, and showed that p-Y393-AGO2 along with
EGFR is upregulated during tumour progression and specifically enriched in hypoxic
tumour areas (Supplementary Fig. 40). To further examine the clinical relevance of AGO2Y393 phosphorylation, we analysed the expression patterns of p-Y393-AGO2 and EGFR
and the degree of hypoxia (indicated by HIF1α and HIF2α; ref. 18) in primary breast
tumours in consecutive sections collected from 128 human breast cancer patients. In
adjacent normal breast tissues the expression of p-Y393-AGO2 was low, but in hypoxic
breast tumours it was highly elevated (Fig. 4d). We observed significant positive
correlations between p-Y393-AGO2, EGFR, HIF1α and HIF2α (Supplementary Fig. 41a
and Supplementary Table 1) and further validated that AGO2-Y393 phosphorylation was
enriched in hypoxic subareas of breast tumours with positive expression of EGFR
(Supplementary Fig. 41b). Moreover, higher expression of p-Y393-AGO2 correlated
significantly with poorer overall survival in breast cancer patients (Fig. 4e), supporting its
clinical importance as a potential prognostic marker for breast cancer patient survival.
In this study, we identified a novel role for EGFR in miRNA maturation via AGO2-Y393
phosphorylation. Although these results suggest that EGFR is the Tyr kinase that suppresses
miRNA maturation through AGO2-Y393 phosphorylation under hypoxia, there may be

other Tyr kinases that can also contribute to phospho-AGO2-mediated miRNA processing.
The work we present here opens a new direction to understanding further the regulation of
miRNA machinery in response to stress signalling, which is likely to have important clinical
implications.

METHODS SUMMARY
We used quantitative PCR with reverse transcription to measure the expression levels of
precursor and mature miRNAs, as described previously27. Customized next-generation RNA
deep sequencing, including both small-RNA application and whole-transcriptome analysis,
was performed according to the standard protocol (Applied Biosystems). The full
methodology can be found in Supplementary Information.

a, Top, proposed role of EGFR in miRNA maturation. Bottom, hierarchical clustering
analysis of R-Pre (log2[precursor miR (scrambled)] − log2[precursor miR (EGFR shRNAE1)]) and R-Mature (log2[mature miR (scrambled)] − log2[mature miR (EGFR shRNAE1)]) identified one distinct cluster of miRNAs whose maturation was suppressed by EGFR
under hypoxia. We define this subcluster as mHESM. b, Top, Venn diagram highlighting
the mRNAs that are regulated by EGFR and likely to be targeted by top-scoring mHESM
(those for which R-Pre − R-Mature ≥0.8 and R-Mature ≤ −0.4). Bottom, EGFR-mediated
suppression of top-scoring mHESM concurrent with the upregulation of targeting mRNAs in
response to hypoxia. AE, average expression.

Figure 3. EGFR phosphorylates AGO2 at Tyr 393 to suppress the maturation of long-loop
mHESM in response to hypoxia

a, In vitro kinase assay detected by 4G10 antibody. b, Immunoprecipitation and western blot
analysis of HeLa Tet-Off-inducible AGO2 stable clones. c, Relative position of Tyr 393 in
the structure of human AGO2 with bound guide RNA22,23. The N (cyan), linker L1
(yellow), PAZ (violet), linker L2 (grey), MID (orange) and PIWI (green) domains are shown
in ribbon representation, and the co-purifying guide RNA (red) is depicted in stick
representation. Tyr 393 and the PIWI box are highlighted in blue. The expanded boxed
segment highlights the electrostatic surface around Tyr 393, including a modelled phosphate
attached to Tyr 393. d, Normalized expression of miRNA and corresponding luciferase
activity of miR reporters (n = 4). e, RNA-binding protein immunoprecipitation (RIP)
enrichment of precursor and mature miRNAs (n = 3). qPCR, quantitative PCR. f, g,
Northern blot analysis as indicated. Dashed lines indicate different exposure times. RNA
integrity was examined by ethidium bromide staining (Supplementary Figs 32 and 33). Data
represent mean ± s.d.; *P <0.05, t-test.

a, Cell apoptosis analysed by FACS (n = 3). b, In vitro migration assay. Result was
calculated on the basis of five randomly selected fields per membrane in triplicate (n = 3). c,
In vitro three-dimensional invasion assay (n = 5). d, Representative images of
immunohistochemical staining of p-Y393-AGO2 in human breast tumour and its adjacent
normal tissue. e, Correlation between p-Y393-AGO2 and overall survival in breast cancer
patients (n = 125). P <0.0001, Kaplan–Meier survival analysis. All data represent mean ±
s.d.; *P <0.05, t-test.
