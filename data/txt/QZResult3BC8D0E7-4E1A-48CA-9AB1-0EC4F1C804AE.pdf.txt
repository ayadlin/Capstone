Abstract
Elevated levels of TGFb are a negative prognostic indicator for patients diagnosed with pancreatic cancer; as a
result, the TGFb pathway is an attractive target for therapy. However, clinical application of pharmacologic
inhibition of TGFb remains challenging because TGFb has tumor suppressor functions in many epithelial
malignancies, including pancreatic cancer. In fact, direct neutralization of TGFb promotes tumor progression of
genetic murine models of pancreatic cancer. Here, we report that neutralizing the activity of murine TGFb
receptor 2 using a monoclonal antibody (2G8) has potent antimetastatic activity in orthotopic human tumor
xenografts, syngeneic tumors, and a genetic model of pancreatic cancer. 2G8 reduced activated ﬁbroblasts,
collagen deposition, microvessel density, and vascular function. These stromal-speciﬁc changes resulted in tumor
cell epithelial differentiation and a potent reduction in metastases. We conclude that TGFb signaling within
stromal cells participates directly in tumor cell phenotype and pancreatic cancer progression. Thus, strategies
that inhibit TGFb-dependent effector functions of stromal cells could be efﬁcacious for the therapy of pancreatic
tumors. Cancer Res; 74(18); 4996–5007. 2014 AACR.

Introduction
Pancreatic cancer, the fourth leading cause of cancer-related
mortality, presents a formidable challenge for treatment (1).
Early metastasis, aggressive tumor biology, and a stromal rich
microenvironment provide potential mechanisms for the resistance of pancreatic cancer to conventional chemotherapy.
Recent work suggests that stromal cells within the tumor
microenvironment are critical determinants of tumor development, progression, and metastasis (2, 3). Therefore, there is
heightened interest in strategies that target stromal cells,
including cancer-associated ﬁbroblasts, immune cells, and
vascular cells.
Numerous cytokines participate in the progression of pancreatic malignancies. In particular, TGFb has a complex function in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA). TGFb is
known to inhibit tumor progression in early stages of PDA
development yet, at later stages, TGFb functions as a tumor

promoter (4). The features that underlie the switch of TGFb
from a tumor suppressor to a tumor promoter in PDA are
unclear. Mutations in the TGFb signaling pathway occur in a
large percentage (>50%) of human PDA (5) and likely contribute to the TGFb functional switch. This has been modeled in
mice where alterations of the TGFb pathway (e.g., deletion of
Smad4 or Tgfbr2) cooperated with activated Kras to promote
disease progression (6–8). Furthermore, elevated expression of
TGFb, which is frequent in PDA can promote tumor development, tumor cell epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT),
and tumor cell survival and motility (9–12). TGFb also induces
immunosuppression, activation of ﬁbroblasts, angiogenesis,
and collagen deposition (13, 14). Therefore, speciﬁcally targeting the protumoral aspects of TGFb might provide therapeutic
efﬁcacy. Pharmacologic strategies that block TGFb activity
have been explored in preclinical models of pancreatic cancer
(reviewed in ref. 15). As discussed by Achyut and Yang (15),
targeting the TGFb pathway alters the tumor microenvironment and the outcome of therapy might be more dependent
upon microenvironmental actions than on direct tumor cell
effects.
Previously, 2G8 (aka MT1), a monoclonal antibody against
mouse TGFb receptor 2 (Tgfbr2), reduced primary tumor
growth and metastasis in several syngenic models of breast
cancer, primarily through its effects on tumor cells and tumorassociated immune cells (16). Given the clinical importance of
TGFb dysregulation in PDA (15), we hypothesized that stromal
Tgfbr2 inhibition could be effective in mouse models of PDA.
Given that 2G8 is mouse-speciﬁc, we implemented this antibody in human xenograft models of PDA to speciﬁcally target
stromal Tgfbr2 without interrupting TGFb signaling in the

TGFbR2 as a Therapeutic Target in PDA

xenografted human tumor cells. We found that inhibition of
the stromal TGFb signaling promoted epithelial differentiation
in tumor cells and inhibited metastasis, results that were
recapitulated in immunocompetent models of PDA. The ﬁndings in xenografts highlight that TGFb induction of stromal cell
function is critical for its impact on tumor cell behavior and
PDA progression.

Materials and Methods
Further information can be found in Supplementary Materials and Methods.
Cell lines
Murine pancreatic cancer cell line Pan02 (Panc02) was
obtained from the Developmental Therapeutics Program at
the NCI. The development of primary murine PDA cell lines
(mPLR) is discussed in the Supplementary Data. Human
pancreatic cancer cell lines (Capan-1 and MiaPaCa-2) were
obtained from ATCC. Colo357 cells were obtained from
Dr. Jason Fleming (MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston,
TX). C5LM2 is a cell line derived from liver metastasis from a
Panc-1 tumor bearing mouse isolated by our laboratory. RAW
264.7 (TIB-71) cells and NIH 3T3 cells were obtained from
ATCC. Cell lines were conﬁrmed to be pathogen-free and
human cell lines were authenticated to conﬁrm origin before
use. Cells were cultured in DMEM (Invitrogen) or RPMI
(Invitrogen) containing 10% FBS and maintained at 37 C in
a humidiﬁed incubator with 5% CO2 and 95% air.
In vivo models
Animals were housed in pathogen-free facility and all animal
studies were performed on a protocol approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at University of
Texas Southwestern Medical Center (Dallas, TX). Animals
were treated with 2G8 (provided by Imclone Systems), a rat
IgG2a anti-mouse Tgfbr2 that does not bind human TGFbR2
(Supplementary Fig. S1), AFRC Mac 48 (Mac 48, a rat IgG2a
speciﬁc for phytochrome; European Collection of Animal Cell
Cultures), or gemcitabine (Eli Lilly and Company) purchased
from the clinical pharmacy at University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center (Dallas, TX).
Orthotopic Pan02 model. Pan02 cells (5  105) were
injected orthotopically in 6 to 8-week-old C57BL/6 mice.
Tumor implantation was conﬁrmed using ultrasound measurements. Ten days after tumor cell implantation, mice were
randomized to receive saline, gemcitabine (25 mg/kg/wk), 2G8
(60 mg/kg/wk), or 2G8 þ gemcitabine. After 4 weeks of therapy,
mice were sacriﬁced. Gross metastatic burden was assessed at
necropsy.
Genetic endpoint model. LSL-KrasG12D; Cdkn2alox/lox;
p48Cre (KIC) mice were generated as described previously
(17). Mice (28–30-day-old) were randomized to receive saline,
gemcitabine (12.5 mg/kg, three times a week), 2G8 (120 mg/kg
once weekly), or 2G8 þ gemcitabine. After 4 weeks of therapy,
mice were sacriﬁced and organs harvested for tissue analysis.
Liver micrometastasis was assessed by hematoxylin and eosin
(H&E) on the anterior lobes of the liver.

Intrasplenic injection model. Pan02 cells (2.5  105)
were injected using splenic parenchyma of 6- to 8-week-old
C57BL/6 mice. Groups were randomized to receive 2G8
(30 mg/kg/wk) 1 day before splenic injection, postinjection
day 1, postinjection day 7, postinjection day 14, or Mac48
(30 mg/kg/wk). Mice were sacriﬁced after 5 weeks after
tumor cell injection.
Xenograft studies. Eight-week-old SCID mice were
injected orthotopically with 1  106 cells (Capan-1, Colo357,
MiaPaCa-2, and C5LM2). One week after tumor cell injection,
mice were randomized to receive 2G8 (30 mg/kg/wk) or saline.
Mice were sacriﬁced after 8 to 10 weeks of treatment. At the
time of sacriﬁce, gross metastases were counted and primary
tumors were snap frozen in liquid nitrogen or ﬁxed in 10%
formalin.
Histology
Formalin-ﬁxed tissues were embedded in parafﬁn, sectioned, and stained with Masson Trichrome and PAS-Alcian
Blue by the Molecular Pathology Core (University of Texas
Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, TX). Immunohistochemistry was performed with the following antibodies:
phospho-Histone H3 (Millipore, 06–570), cleaved caspase-3
(Cell Signaling Technology, 9664), E-cadherin (Santa Cruz
Biotechnology, sc-7870), vimentin (PhosphoSolution, 2105VIM), b-catenin (Cell Signaling Technology, 9582), Zeb1
(Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc 25388), a-smooth muscle actin
(Neomarkers, RB9010-P), S100A4 (Abcam, ab27957), F4/80
(Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-26642), MCP-1 (Santa Cruz
Biotechnology, sc1304), CD206-FITC conjugated (Biolegend,
123006), CD11b-FITC conjugated (Biolegend, 101206), Gr1-PE
conjugated (Biolegend, 108408), and NK 1.1 (Wako, 986–
10001). DeadEnd Fluorometric terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase–mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL)
staining was performed according to the manufacturer's
instructions (Promega, G3250). Fluorescent images were
captured with Photometric Coolsnap HQ camera using NIS
Elements AR 2.3 Software (Nikon). Color images were
obtained Nikon Eclipse E600 microscope using Nikon Digital
Dx1200me camera and ACT1 software (Universal Imaging
Corporation). Pictures were analyzed using NIS Elements
(Nikon).
Statistical analysis
Data were analyzed using GraphPad software (GraphPad
Prism version 5 for Windows). All values are expressed as
mean  SEM. For all statistical analyses, ANOVA or, where
appropriate, unpaired t test was performed and results were
considered signiﬁcant at P < 0.05.

Results
Pharmacologic blockade of stromal Tgfbr2 reduces
metastasis
To explore the relationship between stromal TGFb signaling
and the phenotype of primary tumor cells in vivo, we established human xenograft models of PDA in which we speciﬁcally
inhibited stromal Tgfbr2 with the mouse-speciﬁc antibody 2G8

Figure 1. Inhibition of stromal Tgfbr2 reduces metastasis in vivo. Human pancreatic cancer cell lines Capan-1, Colo357, MiaPaCa-2, and C5LM2 were
orthotopically implanted into NOD-SCID mice. After tumor establishment, mice were randomized to receive saline (control) or 2G8 (30 mg/kg/wk, n ¼ 7–12 per
group). Total gross metastases were determined by evaluation of liver, diaphragm, GI lymph nodes, and lung at the time of sacriﬁce (A). Cell proliferation (B) and
apoptosis (C) in control- and 2G8-treated Capan-1 and MiaPaCa-2 tumors were assessed by immunohistochemistry for phospho-histone H3 (B) or
cleaved caspase-3 (C), respectively. D and E, control- and 2G8-treated tumors from each model were evaluated for apoptosis using TUNEL. TUNEL, green;

(Supplementary Fig. S1). Mice bearing established human
pancreatic tumor orthotopic xenografts (Capan-1, Colo357,
MiaPaCa-2, and C5LM2) were treated systemically with 2G8. In
this setting, 2G8 speciﬁcally targets stromal Tgfbr2 where it
blocks ligation by TGFb, inhibits canonical Smad signaling,
and induces internalization of the receptor (16). Mice were
randomized to receive control or 2G8 weekly 7 to 10 days after
tumor cell injection. We found that inhibition of stromal
Tgfbr2 signiﬁcantly reduced surface metastases on the liver
and other visceral organs (Fig. 1A), reduced cell proliferation
(Fig. 1B), and elevated apoptosis (Fig. 1C–E) in all four tumor
models.

To investigate whether 2G8-treated stromal cells secrete
paracrine factors that affect tumor cell viability, migration, and
colony formation, conditioned media (CM) from cultured
mouse stromal cells (RAW 264.7 and NIH 3T3 cells) treated
with 2G8 was collected and incubated with human pancreatic
tumor cells. Supplementary Figure S2 demonstrates that CM
from 2G8-treated stromal cells did not alter tumor cell viability;
however, 2G8 blunted the ability of stromal-derived media to
promote tumor cell migration toward macrophages (Fig. 2A)
and 3T3 cells (Fig. 2B). Furthermore, when we evaluated
anchorage-independent growth CM from 2G8-treated RAW
264.7 cells (Fig. 2C) and 3T3 cells (Fig. 2D), they showed

normal while livers from Mac48-treated mice were replaced with
tumor (Fig. 2E). Unlike agents that target TGFbR1 and TGFbR2
(12), timing of the treatment did not inﬂuence the tumor burden.
Treatment of mice with 2G8 the day before injection or the day
after injection did not alter its ability to limit the metastatic
burden in the liver. Similarly, there was no signiﬁcant difference
between mice treated 1 week or 2 weeks after tumor cell
inoculation. These data support the functional importance of
stromal Tgfbr2 in the metastasis of pancreatic cancer.
These results suggest that stromal TGFb signaling is critical
for acute tumor development and metastasis of established
tumor cell lines. To determine whether the therapeutic efﬁcacy
of 2G8 extended to syngenic immunocompetent models, we
explored its activity in orthotopic Pan02 tumors and LSLKrasG12D; Cdkn2alox/lox; p48Cre (KIC) mice (18). Importantly,
Pan02 and KIC cells express Tgfbr2, active TGFb, and are
sensitive to 2G8 in vitro (Supplementary Fig. S3). To test
2G8 in vivo, animals with established primary tumor burden
were randomized to receive saline, gemcitabine, 2G8, or a
combination of 2G8 and gemcitabine. Inhibition of Tgfbr2
alone (2G8 treatment) or in combination with gemcitabine
modestly attenuated the weight of Pan02 (Fig. 3A) and KIC
(Fig. 3B) tumors. However, consistent with the human xenograft results, 2G8 alone or in combination with gemcitabine
signiﬁcantly decreased tumor cell viability as evidenced by the
changes in cell proliferation and apoptosis shown in Fig. 3C and
D and Supplementary Fig. S4A–S4C.
Strikingly, 2G8, as a single agent, was very effective at
reducing metastasis (3- to 5-fold; Fig. 3E and F). In fact,
inhibition of TGFb signaling was more effective than gemcitabine at reducing metastases in mice bearing Pan02 tumors
(Fig. 3E) and in KIC mice (Fig. 3F). However, cotreatment with
gemcitabine was not additive with 2G8. Interestingly, 2G8 and
gemcitabine reduced perfusion and permeability in KIC
tumors (Supplementary Fig. S5), partially explaining the lack
of additivity in the combination-treated groups. The results in
syngenic, immunocompetent models implicate stromal Tgfbr2
as a critical driver of PDA dissemination.
Blockade of Tgfbr2 reduces collagen deposition and
ﬁbroblast activation
Stromal cells are key participants in the construction and
remodeling of the tumor microenvironment, activities that are
regulated in part by TGFb (14, 19–21). PDA is a desmoplastic
disease that consists of high levels of collagen (19, 22), which
facilitates tumor cell survival and may impede the delivery of
chemotherapy to tumor cells (23–25). We assessed collagen
deposition by Masson trichrome staining and found that
human xenografts (Fig. 4A and B) and syngenic murine tumors
(Supplementary Fig. S6) from mice treated with 2G8 had
signiﬁcantly reduced collagen deposition. We also found a
concordant and signiﬁcant 2G8-mediated reduction in
mature ﬁbroblasts as evidenced by a-smooth muscle actin
(Fig. 4C and D) and S100A4 (Fig. 4E) immunoreactivity
in Capan-1 and MiaPaCa-2 xenografts and Pan02 tumors (Fig.
4D and Supplementary Fig. S6C). These ﬁndings implicate
Tgfbr2 regulation of ECM deposition and ﬁbroblast phenotype as critical features of the PDA microenvironment.

2G8 promotes a proinﬂammatory immune phenotype in
pancreatic tumors
Metastasis is facilitated by an anti-inﬂammatory (M2)
immune cell phenotype, which TGFb is known to drive
(4, 26–29). In support of this, we found that blocking Tgfbr2
in RAW 264.7 cells in the presence or absence of TGFb
stimulated an M1 (proinﬂammatory) phenotype in vitro (Supplementary Fig. S7). We also evaluated the immune status
of xenografts treated with 2G8. 2G8 reduced the number of
F4/80þ (Fig. 5A and B) and CD68þ (data not shown) macrophages, increased the number of macrophages positive for
MCP-1 (a marker of M1 macrophages; Fig. 5C), and decreased
the number of macrophages expressing MMR (a marker of M2
macrophages; Fig. 5D) in Capan-1 and MiaPaCa-2 tumors.
Furthermore, 2G8 therapy decreased myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC, Gr1þCD11bþ cells; Fig. 5F), while signiﬁcantly
increasing NK cells (NK 1.1þ cells; Fig. 5G) in Capan-1 and
MiaPaCa-2 tumors.
We also assessed the effect of Tgfbr2 inhibition on the
immune landscape in the immunocompetent models. As displayed in Supplementary Fig. S8, inhibition of Tgfbr2 with 2G8
dramatically altered the immune cell phenotype in Pan02
tumors. These changes included a reduction in total macrophage number (F4/80, Supplementary Fig. S8A), an increase in
the ratio of M1:M2 macrophages (Supplementary Fig. S8B and
S8C), a reduction in MDSCs (Gr1þCD11bþ, Supplementary
Fig. S8D) and T regulatory cells (Treg, CD4þFoxP3þ, Supplementary Fig. S8E), and an increase in NK cell recruitment
(NK 1.1, Supplementary Fig. S8F). These results indicate that
stromal Tgfbr2 functions to promote an immunosuppressive
environment while blockade of Tgfbr2 function with 2G8
stimulates recruitment and retention of immune cells that
can combat the tumor.
Targeting Tgfbr2 on tumor cells and stroma inhibits
EMT in vivo
TGFb can drive tumor cells to adopt a mesenchymallike phenotype that promotes tumor cell invasion and
metastasis (30–34). We hypothesized that targeted inhibition of Tgfbr2 would prevent or reverse the induction of
EMT in vivo. Fig. 6A displays general histology (H&E) of
spontaneous KIC tumors from each treatment group at the
end of therapy. Mice receiving 2G8 alone or in combination
with gemcitabine showed an increase in a ductal histologic
phenotype that resembles PanIN lesions. This was conﬁrmed
by staining with PAS-Alcian Blue, which revealed a significant increase in mucin-secreting cells in 2G8-treated
tumors (Fig. 6B). Primary tumors and metastases in the KIC
model exhibited pathologic evidence of ductal differentiation and were classiﬁed as PDAs (Supplementary Fig. S9).
These features included distinct gland formation and ductaltype mucinous epithelium. Furthermore, tumors from mice
treated with 2G8 displayed a signiﬁcant increase in E-cadherin expression (Fig. 6C and E) and a signiﬁcant decrease in
vimentin expression (Fig. 6D and E).
To extend these observations, we evaluated epithelial and
mesenchymal markers in the highly mesenchymal Pan02 model (35). At baseline, Pan02 cells express nuclear b-catenin and

Inhibition of stromal TGFb signaling promotes
epithelial differentiation
TGFb, collagen, ﬁbroblasts, and immune cells all contribute
to tumor cell phenotype. Tumor cells that adopt a mesenchymal phenotype are more aggressive and metastatic (36).
Capan-1 and Colo357 are epithelial, whereas MiaPaCa-2 and
C5LM2 cells have a mesenchymal-like phenotype in vitro
(37, 38). 2G8 treatment in vivo promoted an epithelial phenotype in each xenograft analyzed (Fig. 7 and Supplementary Fig.
S11). Inhibition of Tgfbr2 induced a shift in b-catenin from the
nucleus to the membrane (Fig. 7A–C), increased tumor cell
expression of ECAD (ECAD; Fig. 7D), and decreased Zeb1 levels

serum-free media (SFM), TGFb, 2G8, or TGFb þ 2G8 for 24 to
72 hours and analyzed by immunocytochemistry. mPLR2D
cells treated with SFM expressed ECAD and NCAD, a mesenchymal marker, at detectable levels. Treatment with 2G8
reduced NCAD and increased ECAD expression levels, whereas
TGFb had the opposite effect (Supplementary Fig. S10). Pan02
cells treated in a similar fashion had a mild decrease in zeb1
and vimentin expression after exposure to 2G8 (Supplementary Fig. S10). However, Pan02 did not express ECAD in vitro at
any time point under any condition (data not shown). Overall,
our in vitro studies did not fully recapitulate the dramatic
phenotypic changes induced by 2G8 in vivo. This led us to
hypothesize that stromal cells participate in the 2G8-driven
changes in tumor cell phenotype and reduction in metastases
seen in vivo.

results were found in Colo357 and C5LM2 models (Supplementary Fig. S11). These data indicate that activation of
stromal Tgfbr2 is critical for tumor cell adoption of a mesenchymal-like phenotype.

Discussion
We have shown that pharmacologic blockade of stromal
Tgfbr2 can slow primary tumor growth, reduce metastasis, and
promote epithelial differentiation in mouse models of pancreatic cancer. The changes in tumor cell phenotype and behavior
occurred in the context of microenvironmental changes that
resulted in a proinﬂammatory immune cell phenotype and a
reduced presence of mature/activated ﬁbroblasts. These
alterations in cellular and extracellular components of the
tumor after Tgfbr2 blockade resulted in striking reductions in
metastatic spread and help to functionally deﬁne the importance of stromal Tgfbr2 for primary pancreatic tumor growth
and metastasis.
We employed human PDA xenografts that metastasize
robustly but are often criticized for not recapitulating the
progression of human PDA as well as genetically engineered
mouse models (GEMM). Yet, we found the same proepithelial
and antimetastatic effects after Tgfbr2 inhibition in a wellestablished GEMM of PDA. Furthermore, we used established
human pancreatic cell lines rather than direct human xenografts. Given that we speciﬁcally wanted to target mouse
stromal cells, direct xenografts would not have been

NOD-SCID mice that lack B- and T-cell immunity; therefore,
our studies do not reﬂect the effect of Tgfbr2 inhibition on B

we demonstrate that inhibition of Tgfbr2 on stromal cells
promotes a proinﬂammatory macrophage phenotype that

particular, our in vitro studies suggest interruption of Tgfbr2
signaling in stromal cells alters the expression of soluble
factors that impact tumor cell behavior. This is exempliﬁed
by the concordant results of our anchorage-independent
growth assays in vitro where CM from mouse stromal cells
enhanced colony formation in a Tgfbr2-depedent manner
and the observed reduction in metastasis in vivo after
blockade of stromal Tgfbr2. Whether 2G8 treatment prevents the expression of protumor factors or induces the
expression of factors that inhibit tumor cell colony formation and metastasis is not clear. We evaluated the expression
of twelve cytokines by macrophages (Raw 264.7) and ﬁbroblasts (3T3) after treatment with 2G8 (Supplementary Fig.
S12) and found only modest changes in a small subset of
cytokines. Whether the 2G8-induced elevation in MIP1a,
MIP1b, TNFa, and IFNg expressed by macrophages are
sufﬁcient to induce the dramatic alterations in tumor cell
phenotype and progression remains to be validated.

In a GEMM of PDA, we found that suppression of Tgfbr2
resulted in an increase in PanIN lesions and an increased
epithelial tumor cell phenotype compared with control-treated
mice. In contrast, genetic deletion of Tgfbr2 in pancreatic
tumor cells (Ptf1aCre/þ; KrasG12D; Tgfbr2lox/lox) resulted in
elevated CTGF expression, abundant stroma, and a worse
overall survival compared with Tgfbr2wt/wt animals (7). Given
that TGFb functions as a tumor suppressor early in PDA
development, it is not surprising that targeted ablation of
Tgfbr2 during or before tumor development drives tumor
progression. We chose to target Tgfbr2 at a time point when
the mice are known to have established invasive lesions (18).
Furthermore, in Ptf1aCre/þ; KrasG12D; Tgfbr2lox/lox mice, Tgfbr2
is ablated in tumor cells, whereas, in our study, we targeted
tumor and stromal cell Tgfbr2 within the tumor microenvironment. Overall, our studies document the critical nature of
stromal TGFb signaling to stromal cell recruitment and activity and strengthen the argument that the microenvironment is

a major participant in tumor progression. The results presented here support that blockade of stromal Tgfbr2 inhibits
tumor cell EMT but do not rule out that inhibition of stromal
Tgfbr2 promotes tumor cell mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition (MET). Given the prevalence of poorly differentiated (e.
g., mesenchymal phenotype) tumor cells in control-treated
tumors in each model system employed and the demonstration that EMT occurs early in PDA (36), it is feasible that 2G8
promotes MET in PDA cell lines in vivo.
Although the focus of our work was TGFb-dependent
tumor–stromal cell interactions in PDA, several studies targeting tumor cell TGFb pathways have observed antitumor
effects. In xenograft models, inhibition of TGFbR1 and TGFbR2
resulted in decreased metastasis after splenic injection of
tumor cells (12). In addition, inhibition of tumor cell TGFbR2
in subcutaneous models of human PDA resulted in reduced
primary tumor growth and reduced microvessel density (40).
However, neither of these studies explored stromal cell or
tumor cell phenotype after TGFb receptor inhibition.
Recently, Hezel and colleagues (41) found that direct inhibition of TGFb or the integrin avb6, which is critical for
activation of latent TGFb (42), accelerated the progression of
pancreatic cancer in p48CreKrasG12Dp53lox/þ animals. The
tumors in the p48CreKrasG12Dp53lox/þ animals do not exhibit
the pronounced EMT observed in the GEMM used in the
current study. Furthermore, the study primarily evaluated
survival and documented that inhibition of TGFb or avb6 at
early or later stages accelerated disease progression in a
Smad4-dependent fashion. However, differences in stromal or
tumor cell phenotype after therapy were not evaluated. In
addition, the number of animals in any treatment group with
distinct metastatic lesions was too few to draw meaningful
conclusions regarding the effect of these strategies on tumor
dissemination. These studies taken in the context of our results
suggest that there is a substantial mechanistic difference
between targeting TGFb ligand and inhibiting downstream
signaling by increasing Tgfbr2 internalization.
Studies targeting stromal cells in pancreatic cancer have
shown that decreased stroma results in increased drug delivery
and a reduction in tumor growth (24, 25). In fact, several
ongoing clinical trials in pancreatic cancer aim at stromal
depletion by inhibiting the hedgehog pathway (43). We found
in all six of our mouse models that targeting stromal Tgfbr2
with 2G8 resulted in a signiﬁcant reduction in tumor-associated collagen deposition. However, we found that blockade
of Tgfbr2 signiﬁcantly reduced perfusion and permeability
of high and low molecular weight dextran (Supplementary

Fig. S5), thus collagen deposition is not the only factor contributing to poor drug distribution in PDA.
Results in murine models of cancer document the complexity of targeting TGFb pathways in vivo. Our data suggest that
speciﬁc blockade of stromal Tgfbr2 has a profound antimetastatic effect and demonstrate that stromal cell phenotype is
more critical for tumor cell phenotype and metastasis than
previously appreciated. TGFb acts in a paracrine manner in
virtually every cell type and dissecting which stromal cell type
is primarily responsible for the antimetastatic effect of 2G8
remains a challenge. However, our results strongly implicate
Tgfbr2 on stromal cells as a critical participant in pancreatic
cancer metastasis and underscore the need for an improved
understanding of TGFb biology in this challenging disease.
