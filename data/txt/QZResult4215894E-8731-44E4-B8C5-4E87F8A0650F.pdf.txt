Abstract
Immune dysregulation drives the pathogenesis of chronic inﬂammatory, autoimmune, and dysplastic disorders. While often intended to address localized pathology, most immune modulatory therapies are administered systemically and carry inherent risk of multiorgan toxicities. Here, we demonstrate, in a murine model of
spontaneous gastrointestinal polyposis, that site-speciﬁc uptake of orally administered IL10 microparticles
ameliorates local and systemic disease to enhance survival. Mechanistic investigations showed that the
therapeutic beneﬁt of this treatment derived from neutralization of disease-promoting FoxP3þRoRgtþIL17þ
pathogenic T-regulatory cells (pgTreg), with a concomitant restoration of FoxP3þRoRgtIL17 conventional
T-regulatory cells (Treg). These ﬁndings provide a proof-of-principle for the ability of an oral biologic to restore
immune homeostasis at the intestinal surface. Furthermore, they implicate local manipulation of IL10 as a
tractable therapeutic strategy to address the inﬂammatory sequelae associated with mucosal premalignancy.

Introduction
IL10 is critical for maintenance of immune homeostasis,
particularly at the gastrointestinal interface (1). In both
humans and mice, IL10 deﬁciency is linked to the development
of a wide range of immune-mediated pathologies (2, 3), including cancer (4).
Preclinical studies in murine models of inﬂammatory
disease have demonstrated therapeutic utility for recombinant IL10 (5, 6). In clinical trials, however, intravenous
administration of IL10 to patients with inﬂammatory bowel
disease (IBD) resulted in dose-dependent paradoxical effects
with only nominal therapeutic beneﬁt (7). Because of the
lack of methods for administering IL10 in a tissue-speciﬁc

manner, the clinical potential of IL10 as a biologic therapeutic remains undetermined.
Previous studies have revealed that bioerodible sustainedrelease microparticles prepared via phase inversion nanoencapsulation (PIN) can be used for oral delivery of biologic
molecules to the intestine (8). When applied to models of
intestinal inﬂammation and dysplasia, this strategy affords the
ability to target physiologic quantities of protein to the disease
microenvironment with minimal escape into circulation.
Although the utility of PIN for delivery of nucleic acids and
peptides to the gut mucosa has been established, its effectiveness in targeting bioactive protein therapeutics to gut-associated lymphoid tissue and mesenteric lymph nodes (MLN)
remains undeﬁned.
On the basis of the previous ﬁndings that adoptive transfer
of CD4þCD25þ T cells suppresses intestinal disease in the
APCmin/þ mouse model of spontaneous gastrointestinal polyposis in an IL10-dependent manner (9), we sought to determine whether IL10-encapsulated PIN microparticles could
directly modify the intestinal inﬂammatory landscape and
alter the natural history of this genetically driven preneoplastic
disease. The results provide the ﬁrst evidence for the therapeutic potential of an oral particulate cytokine formulation, in
this case IL10, to ameliorate both local and systemic disease.
Furthermore, our ﬁndings identify pathogenic T-regulatory
cells (pgTreg) as a primary therapeutic target of IL10 in the
dysplastic intestine.

Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees at the University
at Buffalo (Buffalo, NY) and Wadsworth Center (Albany, NY).

antigen retrieval before application of the indicated primary
antibodies. Biotinylated secondary antibodies (anti-rat IgG, BD
Pharmingen), HRP-SA conjugate (Invitrogen), and diaminobenzidine chromogen (Dako) were used for visualization.
Images were taken at 400 magniﬁcation.

Microparticle preparation and oral delivery
IL10-loaded PIN particles were prepared using a modiﬁed
PIN process (10). Two formulations were produced: (i) control
(no cytokine) and (ii) recombinant murine IL10 (Peprotech,
Inc., >98% purity, <1 EU/mg) with a loading of 0.5 mg cytokine/
mg of particles. Control or IL10 microparticles were provided
by oral gavage (1 mg particles in 0.3 mL sterile water) three
times per week for 4 weeks starting at 10 weeks of age. For
experiments utilizing FITC-BSA microparticles, single 30 mg
bolus doses were given.

Histologic scoring
For intestines, histologic scores were assigned in a blinded
fashion using criteria established in our laboratory (see Supplementary Data). For spleens, histologic scores were assigned
using modiﬁed criteria from a previously published report (see
Supplementary Data; ref. 13).

Antibodies
The following antibodies were used for immunoﬂuorescence and IHC: CD45R/B220 (RA3-6B2, BD Pharmingen),
CD11c (N418, eBioscience), Fc receptor block; anti-CD16/CD32
(2.4G2, BD Pharmingen), CD3 (F7.2.38, Agilent Technologies),
and von Willebrand factor (vWF; A0082, Dako). The following
antibodies were used for ﬂow cytometry: CD45.1 (A20,
eBioscience), CD4 (RM4-5, eBioscience), IL17A (TC11-18H10,
BD Pharmingen), FoxP3 (FJK-16s, eBioscience), RoRgt (Q31378, BD Pharmingen), CD44 (IM7, eBioscience), IFNg (XMG1.2,
BD Pharmingen), CD8a (53-6.7, eBioscience), and gd-TCR
(eBioGL3, eBioscience). Anti-mCD4 (GK1.5, BioXCell) was used
for in vivo CD4þ T-cell depletion.
Immunoﬂuorescence tissue collection and staining
Tissues were embedded in OCT compound (Sakura Finetek)
and snap frozen in liquid nitrogen. Of note, 20-mm serial
cryosections were immunostained as indicated previously
(11). Scanning laser confocal images were collected using a
Leica SP5 ABOS microscope and processed using Fiji Software
(http://ﬁji.sc/).
Gross intestinal preparation and polyp quantiﬁcation
Formalin-ﬁxed intestines were opened longitudinally and
polyp burdens were quantiﬁed using a dissecting microscope.
Flow cytometry
Spleens and MLN were processed into single cell suspensions. Intestines were digested and fractionated into lamina
propria mononuclear cells (LPMC) and intraepithelial lymphocytes, as described previously (12). For experiments requiring detection of intracellular antigens (FoxP3, RoRgt, IL17A,
and IFNg), cell suspensions were cultured for 5 hours in the
presence of Golgistop (5 mL/mL; BD), phorbol myristate acetate (50 ng/mL; Sigma), and ionomycin (1 mg/mL Sigma). Cells
were then permeabilized and ﬁxed using an intracellular
staining kit (eBioscience) overnight at 4 C.
Histologic and IHC preparation
Parafﬁn-embedded tissue sections (5 mm) were stained with
hematoxylin and eosin. For IHC, slides were subjected to

Cancer Res; 74(19) October 1, 2014

Hematologic indices
Red blood cell (RBC), hemoglobin (HgB), and hematocrit
(HCT) levels were determined using a Vetscan HM5 automated
analyzer (Abaxis Veterinary Diagnostics).
Mortality tracking
Mortality criteria for APCmin/þ mice were developed and
applied to survival studies. A combined scoring system, taking
into account the degree of weight loss and the severity of
change in activity was selected (see Supplementary Data).
Microarray data processing
RNA was isolated from nonpolyp (for WT and APCmin/þ
mice) and polyp sections (for APCmin/þ mice) of terminal ileum
using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen) and subjected to gene
expression proﬁling. Brieﬂy, RNA was processed into cRNA
using the Affymetrix Genechip 30 IVT Expression Protocol and
applied to Affymetrix Mouse Genome 430A 2.0 arrays. Interference from bacterial RNA was selected against using a probeset enriched in oligos extending into 30 -poly-A tails. Details
with respect to sample processing and preparation can be
accessed from the Gene Expression Omnibus (NIH) under
accession number GSE49970.
Subtotal Treg depletion
DEREG or APCmin/þ-DEREG mice received 1 mg of Diphtheria toxin (DT, Sigma) dissolved in 100 mL of Dulbecco
PBS by intraperitoneal injection on days 0, 1, and 14.
In vivo Treg suppression assay
MLN CD45.2þCD4þCD25þ cells and total lymph node
CD45.1þCD4þCD25 cells were isolated by magnetic selection from either APCmin/þ or BoyJ mice, respectively. A total of
1  106 CD45.1þCD4þCD25 cells were CFSE labeled using the
Vybrant CFDA SE cell tracer kit and adoptively transferred
with 4  105 MLN CD45.2þCD4þCD25þ as indicated, into
8-week-old female RAG1/ recipients.
In vivo adoptive cell transfer
A total of 1  106 magnetically selected MLN CD4þCD25þ T
cells from 14-week-old APCmin/þ mice were adoptively transferred into sex-matched 10 week old APCmin/þ recipients. Four
days before transfer, recipient mice were transiently depleted
of their CD4þ cells using a single 300 mg i.p. dose of anti-CD4
antibody.

Oral Immune-Modulatory Adjuvants for Therapy Dysplasia

Results and Discussion
Oral PIN microparticles loaded with FITC-BSA were taken
up and retained in the Peyer's patches and MLNs of both
APCmin/þ and wild-type mice (Fig. 1A and Supplementary Fig.
S1A and S1B). Microparticles were not detected in the colon,
liver, or spleen at any time point after feeding (Supplementary
Fig. S1C). Moreover, when IL10-loaded microparticles were
delivered in bolus doses, IL10 could not be detected in serum
(data not shown). These results suggest that uptake of microparticles and release of IL10 were effectively localized to
intestinal immune structures.
We directly tested whether oral administration of IL10
microparticles could suppress established polyposis in
APCmin/þ mice. Therapy resulted in a more than 2-fold
reduction in polyp burden (Fig. 1B) and a decreased severity
of disease pathology in the intestine (Supplementary Fig. S2A
and S2B). In APCmin/þ mice, intestinal disease is accompanied
by predictable systemic abnormalities, namely anemia,
splenomegaly, and weight loss (14). To determine whether
amelioration of local disease would result in improvement of
systemic symptoms, we monitored experimental animals over
the course of therapy. In all cases, treatment with IL10
resulted in signiﬁcant beneﬁt (Fig. 1C–E and Supplementary
Fig. S2C). Relief of systemic symptoms was likely secondary to
the suppression of chronic intestinal inﬂammation, as such
activity has been shown to cause anemia (15) and to promote
the establishment of extramedullary hematopoiesis (16).
Accordingly, analysis of APCmin/þ mouse spleens revealed
signiﬁcant megakaryocytosis, which was abrogated following
treatment (Fig. 1D). Chronic treatment resulted in a 15%
extension of both median and maximal lifespan, suggesting
that IL10 could suppress but not arrest disease (Fig. 1F and
Supplementary Fig. S3A).
We sought to deﬁne the potential mechanisms underlying
the therapeutic activity of oral IL10. Because IL17 has recently
been implicated as an essential driver of polyp growth in
APCmin/þ mice (17), and IL10 has been shown to suppress
IL17 production by T cells (18), we hypothesized that the
observed therapeutic effects of IL10 microparticles may partially be attributed to modiﬁcation of T-cell activity. APCmin/þ
nonpolyp and polyp areas demonstrated increasing levels of Tcell activation, with a progressive shift from a balanced Thelper (Th) 1/2/17 proﬁle to an IL1b/IL6/IL23-enriched Th17promoting proﬁle during early-stage disease (Fig. 2A). Importantly, quantiﬁcation of select Th17-related inducer/effector
cytokines conﬁrmed that IL10 microparticles were highly
effective at suppressing the expression of these genes in mice
with established disease (Fig. 2B). In contrast, treatment did
not result in signiﬁcant changes in IFNg or IL4 levels (data not
shown). Taken together, these results demonstrate that IL10

microparticle therapy strongly antagonizes IL17-mediated
inﬂammation.
T cells are thought to be the primary producers of IL17
during chronic intestinal inﬂammation (19). Accordingly, we
examined the IL17 expression proﬁle in various types of
intestinal T cells from our APCmin/þ mice. Although intraepithelial gd-T cells did not produce signiﬁcant levels of IL17
during disease (Supplementary Fig. S3B), there was an increase
in both the total number of CD4þ T cells and in their ability to
produce IL17 (Fig. 2C). IL10 treatment did not impact the
absolute numbers of CD4þ T cells, but did act to dramatically
reduce the percentage of IL17-producing cells within this
population (Fig. 2C). Because both FoxP3RORgtþIL17þ Th17
cells and FoxP3þRoRgtþIL17þ pgTregs are known to be a
major contributor to polyposis in this model (19–21), we
examined the impact of IL10 on IL17 expression by these two
subsets. IL10 treatment resulted in a dramatic reduction in
IL17 production by pgTregs, with only a modest decline in IL17
production by Th17 cells (Fig. 2C). Collectively, these results
suggest that of the IL17-producing T-cell subtypes present
during disease, pgTregs are uniquely sensitive to modulation
by IL10.
Next we examined whether modulation of pgTregs was
the primary mechanism underlying IL10 microparticle therapeutic effect. We crossed APCmin/þ mice with the DEREG
murine model of inducible Treg depletion and developed a
subtotal Treg depletion protocol appropriate for our desire
to assess the contribution of the IL10–pgTreg axis to our
model system. Subtotal Treg depletion resulted in a more
than 70% reduction in FoxP3þ cells over 28 days, yet avoided
the catastrophic myelo- and lympho-proliferative disorder
typically seen in mice undergoing total Treg ablation (Supplementary Fig. S4 and S5A; ref. 22). Subtotal Treg depletion
reduced polyp burden, anemia, and splenic pathology (Fig.
3A and Supplementary Fig. S5B and S5C), supporting the
notion that pgTregs are the major contributors to both local
and systemic disease. Administration of IL10 microparticles
further enhanced depletion-induced therapeutic beneﬁts,
suggesting that IL10 was acting, in part, through neutralization of residual pgTregs. Consistent with this hypothesis,
analysis of MLNs revealed that subtotal Treg depletion
reduced the prevalence of pgTregs, whereas IL10 both
diminished the pgTreg presence and promoted an increase
in conventional Tregs; MLN Th17 cell numbers, however,
remained unaffected (Fig. 3B and Supplementary Fig. S5D
and S5E). Analysis of the LPMCs revealed a similar pattern,
that is, both subtotal Treg depletion and IL10 therapy
diminished the proportion of IL17-positive cells, but the
most signiﬁcant reduction was obtained in the combination
treatment group (Fig. 3C). Whether the superior effect that

was obtained in this group was due to the appearance of a
qualitatively unique Treg population is currently under
investigation.
To determine whether the dual activity of IL10 on pgTregs
and Tregs resulted in altered functional capacity within the
total Treg population, we tested the ability of posttherapy MLN
CD4þCD25þ T cells to suppress na€ve T-cell proliferation and
activation. In comparison with cells isolated from controltreated APCmin/þ mice, the cells from IL10-treated APCmin/þ
mice were signiﬁcantly more effective at suppressing these
processes both in vivo and in vitro (Fig. 4A and Supplementary
Fig. S6C).
The above results demonstrated that the suppressive capacity of APCmin/þ MLN CD4þCD25þ T cells was restored by IL10
microparticle therapy. We predicted that functional rescue of
APCmin/þ intestinal Treg population via reversal of the pgTreg/
Treg ratio was ultimately responsible for disease amelioration.
To conﬁrm this notion, we adoptively transferred MLN CD4þ
CD25þ T cells from control or IL10-treated APCmin/þ mice into
10-week-old APCmin/þ recipients. IL10-conditioned CD4þ
CD25þ T cells reduced polyposis, corrected anemia, and
decreased the prevalence of Th17 cells in recipient MLNs (Fig.
4B and Supplementary Fig. S7A–S7C). Splenic disease, however, was not alleviated after transfer (Supplementary Fig. S7D
and S7E). Whether the inability to restore full therapeutic effect
was due to the limitations of the experimental approach, that
is, accumulation/persistence of transferred cells in the intestine, or to the absence of Treg-independent effects of IL10
microparticle therapy, that is, impacts on the innate immune
system, was not determined.
Our ﬁndings demonstrate that tissue-speciﬁc delivery of a
particulate cytokine formulation can change the natural his-

tory of a highly penetrant genetic condition. We propose that
tissue-localized IL10 serves as a molecular rheostat, speciﬁcally
modulating pgTreg function during intestinal inﬂammatory
and dysplastic disease. The overall concepts tested here are
expected to extend to other inﬂammation-driven diseases,
especially those manifesting at mucosal surfaces, including
IBD, asthma, and genital tract infection.
