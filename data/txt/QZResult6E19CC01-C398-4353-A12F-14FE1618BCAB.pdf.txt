BACKGROUND: There are limited data regarding unique clinical or laboratory features associated with
advanced clear cell (CC) and mucinous (MU) epithelial ovarian cancers (EOC), particularly the relationship
between CA-125 antigen levels and prognosis. METHODS: A retrospective review of 7 previously reported
Gynecologic Oncology Group phase 3 trials in patients with stage III/IV EOC was conducted. A variety of
clinical parameters were examined, including the impact of baseline and changes in the CA-125 level after
treatment of CC and MU EOC on progression-free (PFS) and overall survival (OS). RESULTS: Clinical outcomes among patients with advanced CC and MU EOC were significantly worse when compared with other
cell types (median PFS, 9.7 vs 7.0 vs 16.7 months, respectively, P < .001; median OS, 19.4 vs 11.3 vs 40.5
months, respectively, P < .001). Suboptimal debulking was associated with significantly decreased PFS and
OS among both. Although baseline CA-125 values were lower in CC (median, 154 l/mL) and MU (100 l/

mL), compared with other cell types (275 l/mL), this level did not appear to influence outcome among
these 2 specific subtypes of EOC. However, an elevated level of CA-125 at the end of chemotherapy was
significantly associated with decreased PFS and OS (P < .01 for all). CONCLUSIONS: Surgical debulking
status is the most important variable at prechemotherapy predictive of prognosis among advanced CC and
MU EOC patients. Changes in the CA-125 levels at the end treatment as compared with baseline can serve
as valid indicators of PFS and OS, and likely the degree of inherent chemosensitivity. Cancer

KEY WORDS: CA-125, clear cell cancer, mucinous cell cancer, ovarian cancer.

The serum level of CA-125 is well established as a
highly useful surrogate for monitoring the response to
treatment and confirming relapse in women with epithelial ovarian cancer.1-4 However, the literature has focused
on the more common ovarian cancer histologies, particularly the serous subtype.5-9
The prognostic value of CA-125 for clear cell or
mucinous ovarian cancers is less certain. Both of these
entities are rare in the advanced disease setting, together
accounting for approximately 5% to 8% of all patients in
clinical trials.10-18 Unfortunately, survival of these
patients has been shown to be poor.17,18 There are also
reports that these 2 histologies are relatively resistant to cytotoxic chemotherapy,19-22 and that the CA-125 antigen
may not be secreted in the mucinous cell type.23,24 As a
result of these unique clinical features, one may reasonably
question whether this prognostic factor identified for the
overall epithelial ovarian cancer population actually
applies to these 2 cell types.17,18,25,26
Studies on clear cell and mucinous ovarian cancers
are difficult because of the limited numbers, and realistically require an analysis of the combined experience of
several studies. To examine unique clinical features of
advanced clear cell and mucinous epithelial ovarian cancers, with a particular focus on the predictive value of serum CA-125 antigen in these settings, a review was
conducted of 7 Gynecologic Oncology Group (GOG)
phase III clinical trials.10-16 Reported here are the results
of that evaluation.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
The current study consisted of a review of data obtained
from 7 completed and published phase 3 randomized trials conducted by the GOG (Protocols #111, #114, #132,
#152, #158, #162, and #172) involving patients with
1396

advanced epithelial ovarian cancer. All cases were at International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics
(FIGO) stage III or IV, without undergoing prior chemotherapy or radiation before enrollment in the trials; a majority of patients were treated by standard chemotherapy
of 6 cycles of platinum/paclitaxel as required by protocols.
Details regarding eligibility criteria, treatment, and outcome for each particular study have been previously published.10-16 All patients provided written informed
consent consistent with federal, state, and local requirements before receiving protocol therapy.
The primary endpoints for all 7 studies were progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). PFS
was calculated from the date of study enrollment to the
date of disease recurrence (confirmed on physical, radiologic, or serologic exam), death, or most recent follow-up
visit. OS was calculated from the date of study enrollment
to the date of death by any cause or last contact. The tumor cell type was determined by the individual institution, and all the pathologic materials were centrally
reviewed and confirmed by the GOG Pathology
Committee.
CA-125 data, which were assayed at each clinical
laboratory, were collected at baseline and during treatment. The baseline CA-125 was determined before chemotherapy and after primary surgical cytoreduction. CA125 obtained during treatment was measured at the beginning of each treatment cycle. For the present analysis,
CA-125 at the end of primary chemotherapy was considered the last measurement of CA-125 level over the treatment period whenever the last measurement was
performed.
The baseline patient characteristics evaluated
included patient age, GOG performance status (PS),
FIGO stage, surgical debulking status, and tumor grade.
Patients were divided into 4 groups based on stage and

suboptimal (>1.0 cm), and stage IV. Clear cell carcinoma
was considered ‘‘not graded’’ because there is no accepted
standard grading system for this cell type. PS was defined
according to GOG criteria as: 0 ¼ normal activity; 1 ¼
symptomatic, fully ambulatory; 2 ¼ symptomatic, in bed
less than 50% of the time. The type of chemotherapy was
not considered in the analysis, because the majority
(approximately 90%) of patients received platinum-based
treatment.
Patient characteristics were compared among clear
cell, mucinous, and other cell types using chi-square test
for categorical variables (PS, stage/debulking, and tumor
grade) and Kruskal-Wallis rank test for continuous variables (age and CA-125). The Kaplan-Meier procedure was
used to estimate PFS and OS, and the group difference in
survival function was compared using log-rank test. All
the tests were to assess the null hypotheses that the patient
characteristics and clinical outcomes were not different
among clear cell, mucinous, and other cell types.

The Cox proportional hazards model was used to
assess the association between the clinical and pathological
factors, and disease progression and survival. In the multivariate analysis, patients with suboptimal stage III and
stage IV were combined because of the small number of
patients in the latter group. Likewise, GOG PS of 1 and 2
were combined, as were tumor grades 2 or 3. CA-125 was
categorized as normal (35 l/mL) or high (>35 l/mL),
consistent with the definition of CA-125 normalization
commonly used in clinical practice. All statistical tests
were 2-tailed. P < .05 was interpreted as statistically significant. All statistical analyses were performed using Statistical Analysis Software (SAS) version 9.1 (SAS Institute,
Cary, NC).

RESULTS
One hundred nine (3%) patients with clear cell type and
73 (2%) with mucinous cell type were reviewed from a
total of 3474 stage III/IV patients with epithelial ovarian
cancer enrolled in the 7 GOG protocols. The baseline

characteristics and clinical outcomes for women with the
2 histologies are summarized in Table 1, as compared
with other cell types.
Clear cell or mucinous ovarian cancer patients were
unique in several features: 1) they were more often diagnosed at earlier age (median age: 54 years for clear cell, 52
years for mucinous vs 58 years for other cell types); 2)
well-differentiated tumor (grade 1) was frequently
observed among the mucinous type (51% for mucinous
vs 8% for other cell types); 3) complete resection (without
gross disease residual) was more frequently accomplished
(39% for clear cell and 27% for mucinous vs 16% for
other cell types); 4) CA-125 level (measured at prechemotherapy after surgical debulking) was significantly lower,
particularly among the mucinous type (median level:
154 l/mL for clear cell and 100 l/mL for mucinous vs
275 l/mL for other cell types; elevated CA-125: 87% vs
74% vs 93%); and 5) both clear cell and mucinous
patients experienced substantially poorer outcomes compared with other cell types. The median PFS was 9.7
months for clear cell, 7.0 months for mucinous, and 16.7
months for other cell types, whereas the median OS was
19.4 months, 11.3 months, and 40.5 months, respectively. Sixty-one percent of clear cell patients had disease
recurrence, and 34% died during the first year of study.
The prognosis of mucinous patients was even worse, with
64% showing disease progression and 52% dying by the
end of the first year of follow-up, in contrast to other cell
types with 33% having disease progression and only 11%
dying within the first year of treatment. The survival after
1398

disease recurrence was 7.6 months, 4.1 months, and 19.0
months, respectively, for clear cell, mucinous, and other
cell types.
The prognostic value of pretreatment CA-125 for
ovarian cancer derived from patients based on standard
cisplatin/paclitaxel has been reported elsewhere.27 That
analysis included only 37 clear cell and 26 mucinous cell
patients. The present analysis involved more patients
treated with platinum-based chemotherapy and focused
on assessment of the prognostic value of CA-125 change
after treatment among clear cell and mucinous ovarian
cancers.
Clear Cell Ovarian Cancer
The most common patient characteristics (age, PS, and
stage/debulking status) associated with clinical outcomes
were assessed first using the Cox regression model. The
stage/debulking status were significantly predictive of
prognoses. Compared with the stage III/microscopic
patients, women with suboptimal stage III or stage IV
were at increased risk for disease progression (hazard ratio
[HR], 3.50; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.13-5.75)
and increased risk for death (HR, 2.71; 95% CI, 1.614.57). The prognostic values of age with OS (HR: 1.28,
95% CI, 1.03-1.58 for increase of each 10 years) and PS
with PFS (HR: 1.50, 95% CI, 0.95-2.37, for PS 1 or PS 2
vs PS 0) were also suggestive (Table 2).
Prechemotherapy CA-125 was available for 101
patients. The median level was 154 l/mL, and 13% of

CA-125 at prechemotherapy or during treatment was evaluated separately by Cox regression models. Estimated HR
was adjusted for age, performance status, and International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics stage/volume residual. CA-125 at pretreatment was defined as the measurement at prechemotherapy after surgical debulking. CA-125
at the end of treatment was defined as the last measurement of CA-125 level over the treatment period. CA-125 35 l/

patients had a level 35 l/mL. The baseline CA-125 level
was associated with residual tumor. The median CA-125
was 98, 154, and 225 l/mL, respectively, for stage III-microscopic, stage III optimal, and stage III suboptimal plus
stage IV patients. Seventy-seven patients had CA-125
data recorded during the course of treatment. The median
level of CA-125 at the end of chemotherapy was 21 l/mL,
and 65% of individuals achieved a level 35 l/mL. In
responding patients, the CA-125 antigen decreased with
each treatment cycle, with a steep reduction after the first
course.
The prognostic value of CA-125 at baseline or during treatment was evaluated separately. The relative risk
for disease progression or death for patients >35 l/mL
(high) versus 35 l/mL (normal) was estimated and
adjusted for stage/debulking status, age, and PS. As shown
in Table 3, there is a suggestion that CA-125 at baseline
was associated with the clinical outcomes (HR, 1.95; 95%
CI, 0.84-5.54 for disease progression; and HR, 1.42; 95%
CI, 0.57-3.53 for death), although it did not reach the
level of being statistically significant. However, there is
strong evidence that the CA-125 level at the end of treatment was independently predictive of both disease progression (HR, 3.34; 95% CI, 1.96-5.68) and death (HR,
2.41; 95% CI, 1.39-4.19). The estimate of cumulative
distribution of PFS based on CA-125 change is illustrated
in Figure 1.
Mucinous Ovarian Cancer
Similarly, the relationships of age, PS, stage/debulking
status, and tumor grade with clinical outcomes were
assessed for patients with mucinous ovarian cancer. Consistent with the data for clear cell type, the stage/debulking
Cancer

status was the most important factor associated with prognoses. Patients with suboptimal stage III or stage IV had a
relative risk of 2.28 (95% CI, 1.25-4.15) for disease progression and a relative risk of 2.08 (95% CI, 1.14-3.78)
for death compared with stage III/microscopic patients.
In contrast to clear cell patients, the association of age
with clinical outcome for mucinous patients was not statistically significant. Furthermore, there is no evidence that
tumor grade was predictive of either PFS (HR, 1.05; 95%
CI, 0.64-1.72 for grade 2 of 3 vs grade 1) or OS (HR,
1.09; 95% CI, 0.66-1.79) (Table 4).
Sixty-six patients had baseline CA-125 data. The
median level was 100 l/mL (48, 47, and 154 l/mL,
respectively, for stage III-microscopic, stage III optimal,
and stage III suboptimal plus stage IV), with 26% of
patients having a prechemotherapy level 35 l/mL. The
CA-125 data at the end of chemotherapy was available for
50 patients, with a median level of 24 l/mL and 62% of
individuals having a level 35 l/mL.
After adjusting for stage/debulking status, age, and
PS, the CA-125 level at baseline was not significantly
related to PFS (HR, 1.23; 95% CI, 0.65-2.34), although
it showed a trend toward significance with OS (HR, 1.68;
95% CI, 0.89-3.17). However, in contrast to the prechemotherapy CA-125, the CA-125 level at the end of treatment was highly associated with both PFS (HR, 5.08;
95% CI, 2.40-10.75) and OS (HR, 2.25; 95% CI, 1.915.52) (Table 5). The estimate of PFS, based on CA-125
change from baseline determination to the end of chemotherapy, is shown in Figure 2. The normal-to-normal
(35 l/mL at both time points) and high-to-normal
(CA-125 reduced to 35 at the end of treatment from
>35 l/mL at pretreatment) groups demonstrated similar
PFS, whereas the high-to-high (>35 l/mL at 2 time

data indicate that CA-125 regressing to normal during
chemotherapy is a sensitive and significant factor associated with a more favorable prognosis for mucinous epithelial ovarian cancer.

In summary, stage and tumor residual were the most
important prognostic factors for both clear cell and mucinous epithelial ovarian cancer patients; age was only associated with OS for clear cell patients; neither tumor grade

among these 2 specific cell types.

DISCUSSION
This examination of 7 large multi-institutional phase 3
GOG trials that included advanced clear cell and mucinous ovarian cancers has confirmed both the rarity of
these histologic types (combined 5% incidence in the 7
Cancer

April 1, 2009

studies involving more than 3000 total patients), and the
poor prognosis associated with these entities.17-22
As known for other cell types, the stage of disease
and the amount of residual cancer are the 2 most
important prognostic factors for patients presenting with
either an advanced clear cell or mucinous ovarian cancer.
Of interest, in this series, patients with both of these histologies were younger at presentation, compared with the
other cell types. Also striking was the lack of association
between tumor grade and survival in mucinous ovarian
cancer.
1401

Review Article

A higher percentage of advanced stage mucinous
and clear cell ovarian cancers were surgically cytoreduced
to microscopic disease, compared with other cell types.
Despite this observation, these patients experienced a substantially inferior overall outcome. This fact reinforces the
concept of the relative chemoresistance of both clinical
entities.19-22
Data regarding the serum CA-125 levels for patients
presenting with advanced clear cell and mucinous ovarian
cancers, and their relationship to survival, are also revealing.
In both entities, the baseline (prechemotherapy) CA-125
antigen levels are lower than other cell types, with median
values for clear cell and mucinous cancers being approximately 1=2 and 1=3, respectively, compared with all other epithelial ovarian histologies. This observation may result
both from the apparent initial smaller volume of disease
present after primary surgical cytoreduction as well as from
fundamental differences in the biology of the malignancies.
However, of particular note, although the baseline
CA-125 determinations were less significant in prediction
of clinical outcomes, CA-125 regressing to a normal level
after treatment was significantly associated with improved
PFS and OS in clear cell and mucinous ovarian cancers.
This subgroup of patients, representing approximately
50% of either clear cell or mucinous ovarian cancers, was
more likely to benefit from treatment.
Our data also suggest that currently available platinum-based chemotherapy appears to be of only modest
benefit in both advanced clear cell and mucinous ovarian
cancers as compared with serous and other cell types,
although some patients with these histologies and some
degree of drug sensitivity may experience a meaningful
degree of benefit from such therapy. It is relevant to note
that survival in these populations, although generally
quite poor, might be considerably worse in the absence of
the delivery of platinum-based chemotherapy. New treatment approaches are urgently required in both advanced
clear cell and mucinous ovarian cancers.
Although the number of clear cell (n ¼ 109) or
mucinous cell type (n ¼ 73) patients included in the present study is still limited, it is 1 of the largest studies on
advanced clear cell and mucinous epithelial ovarian cancers thus far. All the data were based on phase III clinical
trials. Patients received standard surgical treatments, and
clinical information (clinical parameters, CA-125, and
outcomes) were prospectively collected in a rigorous man1402

ner, although the analysis was done retrospectively. Our
data would provide reliable information for understanding these 2 rare cell types of epithelial ovarian cancer at an
advanced setting.
