Essential Requirement for PP2A Inhibition by the Oncogenic
Receptor c-KIT Suggests PP2A Reactivation as a Strategy to
Treat c-KITþ Cancers — Letter
Amaury G. Dumont, David G. Reynoso, and Jonathan C. Trent

In the article by Roberts and colleagues (1), the authors demonstrated that inhibition of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) was
required for survival of myeloid cells expressing mutant KIT.
Restoration of PP2A activity by FTY720 (fingolimod; Novartis)
was cytotoxic to these cells. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration
(FDA) has just approved fingolimod as treatment for relapsing
forms of multiple sclerosis (MS) at 0.5 mg daily dose based on the
results of 2 phase 3 clinical trials (2, 3). In view of the FDA approval
and the work by Roberts and colleagues, there is clear potential
for FTY720 as a therapeutic agent for KIT-expressing tumors.
Our group focuses on preclinical and clinical development of
new therapeutic approaches for patients with gastrointestinal
stromal tumor (GIST), a sarcoma driven by KIT gain-of-function
mutations. The standard-of-care for patients with advanced GIST
is imatinib mesylate but most patients develop resistance after
about 2 years (4). As such, we believe that dephosphorylation and
inactivation of KIT induced by PP2A activation offers an attractive
therapeutic strategy for patients with GIST. However, we are
cautiously optimistic about the clinical applicability of FTY720
as proposed by Roberts and colleagues. Specifically, the IC50 of
FTY720 for murine FDC-P1 cells expressing the imatinib-resistant
D816V mutant KIT was found to be 2.4 mmol/L (737.9 ng/mL).
Similarly, the IC50 ranged between 3.4 and 4.9 mmol/L in human
leukemia cell lines expressing mutant KIT. Although effective in
vitro, these concentrations exceed that obtained in clinical trials
and would require higher oral dosing than has been reported. In a
pooled pharmacokinetic analysis of the phase III studies for MS the

average steady-state plasma concentrations of FTY720 at doses of
0.5 and 1.25 mg were 2 to 3 and 5 to 6 ng/mL, respectively (2, 3).
This prompted us to evaluate FTY720 in a panel of previously-described GIST cells (Table 1) harboring imatinibsensitive and -resistant KIT mutations (5). Although FTY720
was significantly cytotoxic, achieving 80% to 95% inhibition in
all GIST cell lines, the concentration required for antitumor
efficacy was 10 mmol/L. The IC50 of FTY720 at 72 hours ranged
between 2.9 and 3.9 mmol/L in GIST cells.
In summary, we feel that PP2A-reactivation is a promising
approach in GIST but will require higher doses of FTY720 than
that observed in patients with MS. Although we hope that this
agent will prove active in the treatment of patients with GIST,
we also hope that these issues are considered in the design of
clinical trials for patients with GIST.
