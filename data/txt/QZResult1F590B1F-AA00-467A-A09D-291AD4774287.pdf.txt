Responses to Transforming Growth Factor β

Abstract
Engagement of the transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) receptor complex activates multiple signaling
pathways that play crucial roles in both health and disease. TGF-β is a key regulator of fibrogenesis and
cancer-associated desmoplasia; however, its exact mode of action in these pathologic processes has remained
poorly defined. Here, we report a novel mechanism whereby signaling via members of the ERBB or epidermal
growth factor family of receptors serves as a central requirement for the biological responses of fibroblasts to
TGF-β. We show that TGF-β triggers upregulation of ERBB ligands and activation of cognate receptors via
the canonical SMAD pathway in fibroblasts. Interestingly, activation of ERBB is commonly observed in a
subset of fibroblast but not epithelial cells from different species, indicating cell type specificity. Moreover,
using genetic and pharmacologic approaches, we show that ERBB activation by TGF-β is essential for the
induction of fibroblast cell morphologic transformation and anchorage-independent growth. Together, these
results uncover important aspects of TGF-β signaling that highlight the role of ERBB ligands/receptors as
critical mediators in fibroblast responses to this pleiotropic cytokine. Cancer Res; 70(19); 7421–30. ©2010 AACR.

Introduction
Transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) is a pleiotropic
cytokine with important roles in normal development as
well as in various types of diseases (1–4). Under normal
physiologic conditions, although TGF-β imposes growth inhibition on different cell types (e.g., epithelial and B cells), a
function vital to tissue homeostasis (5, 6), it stimulates the
growth of fibroblast cells as observed in the context of
wound healing (7). In response to chronic cellular insults
however, these tightly regulated functions of TGF-β may
lose their integrity, giving rise to a variety of physiologic
disorders (1–4). Fibrosis and cancer are diseases whose progression is often largely influenced by TGF-β. Excessive fibroblast proliferation, myofibroblast differentiation, and
overproduction of extracellular matrix are the most prominent hallmarks of fibrogenesis and desmoplastic reaction in
cancer. Of note, TGF-β acts as a master regulator in all of
these processes (3). Therefore, deciphering the biochemical
mechanisms controlling fibroblast responses to TGF-β will
help identify potential therapeutic targets.

TGF-β signaling is initiated at the cell surface through
binding of a TGF-β homodimer to the constitutively active
type II TGF-β receptor. This association elicits recruitment
of the dormant type I TGF-β receptor (ALK5), leading to its
phosphorylation in the cytoplasmic juxtamembrane region
(8). Following receptor internalization, phosphorylation of
the receptor-regulated transcription factors SMAD2 and
SMAD3 subsequently ensues, followed by oligomerization
with the common mediator SMAD4. These complexes then
translocate to the nucleus, where they control gene transcription in concert with other coregulators (9, 10). Activation of
the SMAD pathway has been implicated in the regulation of a
large repertoire of genes, and a significant part of the phenotypic changes induced by TGF-β has been attributed to
SMADs (1–5). Nonetheless, additional noncanonical signaling
cascades have been shown to emanate from the TGF-β receptor complex, and these also play critical roles in mediating the
biological effects of TGF-β (11). Thus, the cellular responses
to TGF-β clearly result from a complex interplay of multiple
signaling pathways. Gaining insight into how these various
pathways function and cross-talk, as well as the molecular
settings under which they operate, may shed light on the
mechanisms underlying TGF-β–associated pathologies.
ERBB proteins are members of a family of receptor tyrosine
kinases that include ERBB1/epidermal growth factor receptor
(EGFR)/human epidermal growth factor receptor 1 (HER1),
ERBB2/Neu/HER2, ERBB3/HER3, and ERBB4/HER4. On ligand binding, these receptors homodimerize/heterodimerize
and autophosphorylate on tyrosine residues, thereby facilitating the activation of a large network of signaling pathways.
The case of ERBB2 is an exception because this receptor is
ligandless but serves as the preferred dimerization partner

for other family members. On the other hand, although
ERBB3 is devoid of intrinsic kinase activity, it still retains signaling capability due to transphosphorylation by its partners
(12, 13). ERBB receptors can interact with a multitude of ligands categorized into three groups according to their binding specificities. Ligands that exclusively bind ERBB1/EGFR
include amphiregulin (AREG), epidermal growth factor
(EGF), epigen, and TGF-α. β-Cellulin, epiregulin (EREG),
and heparin-binding EGF-like growth factor (HBEGF) are
more promiscuous and activate ERBB4 in addition to ERBB1.
The third group of ligands harbors the neuregulins (NRG1–
NRG4), which bind ERBB3 and/or ERBB4 (12, 14).
Several studies have documented the importance of ERBBs
in the pathogenesis of fibrosis. For instance, the pharmacologic inhibition of ERBB kinase activity significantly reduced
the extent of pulmonary fibrosis in experimental model systems (15, 16). Likewise, conditional expression of the ERBB
ligand TGF-α in the lungs of transgenic mice caused pulmonary fibrosis (17), and this could be mitigated by the administration of the ERBB tyrosine kinase inhibitors gefitinib and
erlotinib (18). On the other hand, TGF-β was previously
shown to trigger the activation of ERBB1 and/or induction
of its ligands in endothelial (19) and hepatoma (20) cells.
In both cases, signaling via ERBB1 was essential for implementing the biological activity of TGF-β. Because TGF-β
has an established role in fibrogenesis (1, 4), these observations led us to hypothesize that ERBB receptors might act as
mediators in fibroblast responses to this cytokine. The present study was designed to address this hypothesis. Here, we
show that (a) TGF-β induces ERBB ligand expression and receptor activation via the canonical SMAD pathway in fibroblasts, (b) activation of ERBB by TGF-β is cell type specific,
and (c) ERBB activation is required for TGF-β–stimulated
fibroblast cell morphologic transformation and anchorageindependent growth (AIG). These results expose a novel role
of ERBB in regulating profibrotic TGF-β signaling.

Materials and Methods

The following cells lines were used in this study: murine
fibroblasts (AKR-2B and Swiss-3T3); human fibroblasts [human skin fibroblast (HSF) and IMR-90]; murine (NMuMg), human (HaCaT, HeLa, and MCF-10A), canine [Madin-Darby
canine kidney cells (MDCK)] epithelial cells; and mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF) derived from Smad2−/− mice. The
Smad knockout MEFs and their wild-type (WT) counterpart
were provided in 2002 by Dr. Anita Roberts (NIH). Unless indicated otherwise, cells were obtained from American Type
Culture Collection (ATCC) during the past 5 years and routinely maintained in high-glucose DMEM (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Hyclone). IMR-90
cells were grown in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS, sodium pyruvate (1 mmol/L), and nonessential amino acids
(Cellgro), whereas MEGM (Lonza) was used for MCF-10A cultures. Lines have not been independently authenticated.
In all experiments, cells were grown under reduced serum

reagents. Media formulations were as follows: DMEM supplemented with 0.1% FBS (AKR-2B, HaCaT, HeLa, IMR-90,
MDCK, MEFs, and Swiss-3T3), DMEM supplemented with
2% FBS (NMuMg), MEM supplemented with 0.1% FBS
(HSF), and serum-free MEBM (Lonza; MCF-10A).
Antibodies and other reagents
Anti–phosphorylated AKT (Ser473), anti-AKT, and anti–
phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)
were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology, whereas
anti-ERBB1, anti-ERBB2, and anti-ERK1/2 were purchased
from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Anti–phosphorylated SMAD2
was obtained from Calbiochem, and anti–glyceraldehyde-3phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) was from Chemicon/
Millipore. Anti-ERBB1, anti-phosphotyrosine (Clone 4G10),
and anti-SMAD2/3 were both from Upstate/Millipore. AntiSMAD3 was from Abcam, whereas the phosphorylated Smad3specific antibody (Immunogen; COOH-GSPSIRCSpSVpS) was
generated in our laboratory (21). Human TGF-β was obtained
from R&D Systems.
Protein extraction, immunoprecipitation, and
Western blotting
Cells were harvested in modified radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer [50 mmol/L Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mmol/L
NaCl, 0.25% Na-deoxycholate, 1% IGEPAL CA-630, 1 mmol/L
EDTA supplemented with 50 mmol/L NaF, 1 mmol/L Na3VO4,
1 mmol/L phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and complete protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche)], subjected to one freeze-thaw
cycle, and passed through a 27-G needle for three times. Proteins were extracted on ice for >1 hour with occasional gentle
vortexing, and debris and insoluble materials were pelleted by
centrifugation at 16,060 × g for 10 minutes.
For immunoprecipitation, total protein extracts (400–600
μg) were precleared with protein A-agarose beads (Millipore;
40 μL of 50% slurry) and mixed with 500 μL of 2× immunoprecipitation buffer [20 mmol/L Tris (pH 7.4), 300 mmol/L
NaCl, 2% Triton X-100, 1.0% IGEPAL CA-630, 2 mmol/L
EDTA, 2 mmol/L EGTA (pH 8.0), supplemented with 50
mmol/L NaF, 1 mmol/L Na3VO4, 1 mmol/L phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and complete protease inhibitor cocktail]. The
total volume was subsequently brought to 1 mL using dH2O.
The appropriate antibodies were added and incubated overnight (>12 hours). Immune complexes were collected by addition of protein A-agarose beads (40 μL) and incubation for
2 hours at 4°C. Following three rinses in immunoprecipitation buffer, proteins were eluted in 2× protein loading buffer
and analyzed by Western blotting according to protocols recommended by the primary antibody manufacturers.
Protein kinase assay
For kinase assays, cells were grown to confluence and serum starved overnight. Cultures were treated as indicated and
harvested for protein extraction as described above. Equivalent protein extracts (400–600 μg) were incubated overnight
at 4°C with antibody. Immune complexes were collected with
protein A-sepharose (Sigma) and washed twice in kinase lysis
buffer [50 mmol/L Tris (pH 7.4), 5 mmol/L EDTA, 250 mmol/L

kinase buffer [25 mmol/L Tris (pH 7.4), 10 mmol/L MgCl2,
and 1 mmol/L DTT] before incubation in 50 μL kinase buffer
containing 15 μmol/L ATP, 5 μg myelin basic protein (MBP;
Sigma), and 5 μCi/μL [γ32P]ATP. The kinase reaction was allowed to proceed for 10 minutes at 37°C, stopped with 50 μL
2× Laemmli buffer, and following SDS-PAGE visualized by
autoradiography.
Reverse transcription-PCR analysis
Total RNA was isolated using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen).
Two micrograms of RNA were reverse transcribed by the
SuperScript III Reverse Transcriptase system (Invitrogen).
Complementary DNAs were subjected to amplification by
PCR using the parameters provided in Supplementary Table
S1. PCR reagents were from Denville. PCR products were
electrophoretically resolved on 2% agarose gel stained with
ethidium bromide. The black-and-white setting of images
was inverted to improve the visual detection of DNA bands.
RNA interference
Plasmids (pLKO.1-puro) encoding short hairpin RNA
(shRNA) targeting murine ErbB1, ErbB2, Smad2, and Smad3
were purchased from the Mayo Clinic Jacksonville RNA Interference Technology Resource. The production of lentivirus
and the transduction of AKR-2B cells were essentially as described previously (22). Stable clones or cell populations were
generated in the presence of 1.5 μg/mL puromycin.
Morphologic transformation
Confluent AKR-2B cells grown on coverslips in six-well tissue culture plates were serum starved for 24 hours and were
left untreated or treated with TGF-β1 (10 ng/mL) in the presence or absence of lapatinib (5 μmol/L)/DMSO (vehicle) for
48 hours. AKR-2B cells carrying shRNA targeting ErbB1 and/
or ErbB2 or a nontargeting control were processed as above.
In all experiments, cells were fixed in 4% formaldehyde (20
minutes at 37°C) before permeabilizing with 0.1% Triton
X-100 in PBS (2 minutes on ice) and staining of filamentous
actin (F-actin; 1 hour at room temperature) with tetrarhodamine isothiocyanate (TRITC)–labeled phalloidin (Sigma). Nuclei were stained with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI).
Photomicrographs were generated using an AX70 fluorescence microscope (Olympus).
Soft agar assay
The experimental conditions for soft agar assay were as described (22). The ability of cells to undergo AIG following TGFβ treatment was evaluated by counting colonies of >50 μm in
diameter using a Gelcount apparatus (Oxford Optronics).

Results
TGF-β induces ERBB ligand expression and receptor
activation in fibroblasts
Results from previous studies have suggested a role(s) for
ERBB receptors in the pathogenesis of fibrosis (15, 16). Moreover, the ERBB pathway was shown to mediate the biological

www.aacrjournals.org

effects of TGF-β in endothelial and hepatoma cells (19, 20).
In light of these observations, we sought to determine whether TGF-β could modulate ERBB ligand expression and/or receptor activation in fibroblast cells. As fibroblasts primarily
express ERBB1 and ERBB2 (Supplementary Text S1 and Supplementary Fig. S1), the relevant receptor combinations that
could be activated include ERBB1 homodimers and ERBB1/
ERBB2 heterodimers (12). Therefore, we focused our subsequent analyses on these two receptors and their known ligands (12). AKR-2B fibroblast cells were stimulated with
TGF-β for various periods of time, and the expression of
ERBB ligands was evaluated by reverse transcription-PCR
(RT-PCR). Our results show that, of the seven ligands tested,
only Areg, Ereg, and Hbegf exhibited robust induction by
TGF-β (Fig. 1A). To ascertain if TGF-β could activate ERBB
receptors, a time course experiment was performed as above,
and ERBB1 and ERBB2 were immunoprecipitated and tested
for tyrosine phosphorylation. Our results indicate that TGF-β
activated both ERBB receptors, with the first detectable
increase in phosphorylation occurring between 3 and 6 hours
and a peak around 12 hours poststimulation (Fig. 1B). The
kinetic of ERBB1/2 activation (Fig. 1B) by TGF-β was similar
to that of ligand induction (Fig. 1A) and was significantly
delayed relative to direct addition of ERBB ligands (Supplementary Fig. S1B; ref. 12).
To verify that the observations made in AKR-2B cells could
be extended to other fibroblast cells, additional lines were investigated. Results show that Hbegf was upregulated by TGFβ in all cell lines tested (Fig. 1C and Supplementary Fig. S2).
However, although induction of Areg and Ereg was restricted
to murine fibroblasts (Fig. 1A and Supplementary Fig. S2A),
enhanced expression of EGF was observed in addition to
HBEGF in their human counterparts (Fig. 1C and Supplementary Fig. S2B). Nonetheless, despite these interspecies variations, TGF-β consistently stimulated activation of ERBB1 in
all fibroblast lines as revealed by an increase in kinase activity (Fig. 1D) and/or tyrosine phosphorylation (Supplementary
Fig. S2C). These results suggest that the ability to induce
ERBB ligand expression and receptor activation in response
to TGF-β is a feature commonly shared by fibroblast cells.
Activation of ERBB by TGF-β exhibits cell
type specificity
The differential responses of fibroblast and epithelial cells
to TGF-β (i.e., growth stimulation versus inhibition, respectively; refs. 5–7) may be explained, at least in part, by the selective activation of cell type–specific pathway(s). We have
previously reported that TGF-β activates a network of nonSMAD signaling pathways endowed with proliferative/
prosurvival properties and conveying profibrotic effects of
TGF-β, only in fibroblast but not in epithelial cells (21,
23–25). Given that ERBB signaling is known to promote cell
proliferation and survival (13, 26), we asked whether the
common activation of ERBB1 by TGF-β in fibroblasts
(Fig. 1D) also displays a similar cell tropism. To address this
question, we examined the activation profiles of ERBB1 in a
panel of established epithelial lines from different species
following treatment with TGF-β for various time periods.

Figure 1. TGF-β induces ERBB ligand expression and receptor activation in mesenchymal cells. A, AKR-2B fibroblast cells were treated with TGF-β
(10 ng/mL) and harvested at various time points, and total RNA (2 μg) was subjected to RT-PCR analysis using primers specific for the indicated target
genes. Control (Ctrl) sample consisted of mouse heart RNA. B, AKR-2B cells were treated as in A, and total proteins (400 μg) were subjected to
immunoprecipitation (IP) using ERBB1- or ERBB2-specific antibodies. Immunoprecipitates were analyzed by Western blotting using phosphotyrosine
(pY)–specific antibodies. Membranes were stripped and reprobed with ERBB1 or ERBB2 antibodies. The expression levels of total ERBB1, ERBB2, and
GAPDH (internal control) were assessed by Western blot analysis (50 μg). C, human fibroblast cells (IMR-90) were treated as in A, and total RNA was
subjected to RT-PCR analysis for ERBB ligands. Control (Ctrl) sample consisted of human heart RNA. D, murine (AKR-2B and Swiss-3T3) and human
(IMR-90 and HSF) fibroblast cells were treated as in A. ERBB1 was immunoprecipitated from total protein extracts (400–600 μg) and subjected to in vitro
kinase assays using MBP as a substrate. Total protein aliquots (50 μg) were subjected to Western blot analysis to evaluate the expression levels of total
ERBB1 and GAPDH (internal control).

Results from in vitro kinase assays show that none of the cell
lines tested exhibited a detectable increase in ERBB1 kinase
activity in response to TGF-β stimulation for up to 12 hours.
In contrast, ERBB1 was activated by TGF-α in all lines, indicating the presence of functional receptors (Fig. 2A). Moreover,
the observation that SMAD3 was consistently activated in all
cell lines (Fig. 2B) excludes the possibility of dysfunctional
TGF-β signaling at the receptor level. As earlier studies documented an inhibitory effect of TGF-β on ERBB ligand expression in epithelial cells (27), we examined the expression
profiles of several ERBB ligands in two different epithelial lines
treated with TGF-β. Our results show that, although TGF-β
caused no discernible effect on ERBB ligand expression in
HeLa cells (Fig. 2C), it led to a time-dependent decrease in

7424

Cancer Res; 70(19) October 1, 2010

the mRNA levels of several ERBB ligands (AREG, EREG, and
HBEGF) in MCF-10A cells (Fig. 2D). It should be noted, however, that a parallel decline in GAPDH expression (internal
control) was also observed, although the levels of TGF-α remained virtually unchanged (Fig. 2D). Overall, these data suggest that ERBB activation is a feature that distinguishes TGF-β
signaling in fibroblasts and epithelia.
Induction of ERBB ligands by TGF-β occurs via the
SMAD pathway
TGF-β primarily exerts its biological effects through the canonical SMAD pathway; however, other non-SMAD pathways
have been shown to comodulate cellular response to the cytokine (1–5, 11). To assess the role of SMADs in ERBB ligand

induction and receptor activation, AKR-2B cells stably expressing shRNA targeting Smad2, Smad3, or a nontargeting control were treated with TGF-β for different time periods. The
induction profiles of Areg, Ereg, and Hbegf as well as the activation of ERBB1 were examined. Results from RT-PCR analyses revealed that TGF-β induced each of the three ligands to
comparable levels in untransduced AKR-2B cells and those
expressing control shRNA (Fig. 3A). In contrast, inhibition of
SMAD2 expression by RNA interference (RNAi) resulted in a
slightly reduced induction of Areg and Ereg, no significant effect on Hbegf, and a parallel diminution in TGF-β–dependent
ERBB1 and SMAD2 phosphorylation (Fig. 3A and B). The most
dramatic effects, however, were observed in Smad3 knockdown cells, in which TGF-β–induced upregulation of all three
ligands (Fig. 3A) and phosphorylation of ERBB1 (Fig. 3B) was
significantly decreased. It should be noted that, although a
satisfactory inhibition of SMAD3 expression was readily

achieved (Fig. 3B), we have not been able to obtain further
knockdown of SMAD2 beyond that presented (Fig. 3B) without affecting the expression of SMAD3 (data not shown). As
such, to more clearly define the contribution of SMAD2, the
induction of ERBB ligand expression in Smad2 null MEFs
was examined. Although some variation in kinetics was
observed between WT and Smad2 knockout lines, loss of
SMAD2 had no effect on the induction of Areg, Ereg, or Hbegf
(Fig. 3C). As expected, the activation profile of SMAD3 in
Smad2−/− cells was comparable with that of WT cells (Fig. 3D).
These data indicate that induction of ERBB ligand expression
and receptor activation by TGF-β in fibroblasts are dependent
on the SMAD pathway, primarily SMAD3.

with TGF-β (10 ng/mL) for 6 or 12 h and harvested for total RNA extraction. Untransduced AKR-2B cells (Untr) and cells transduced with nontargeting

SMAD2 (p-SMAD2), and phosphorylated SMAD3 (p-SMAD3). SMAD2 and SMAD3 antibodies were used to determine silencing efficiency for both
genes. GAPDH served as an internal control. C, murine embryonic fibroblast cells, lacking expression of Smad2 (Smad2−/−) as well as the WT counterpart,
were treated with TGF-β (10 ng/mL), harvested at various time points, and subjected to RT-PCR analysis using primers specific for Areg, Ereg, or Hbegf.

kinase–ERK1/2 axis (13). To determine if the activation of
ERBB by TGF-β (Fig. 1B) was functionally relevant, we examined whether TGF-β could activate ERK1/2 downstream of
ERBB. AKR-2B cells were treated with TGF-β in the presence
or absence of the dual ERBB1/2-specific kinase inhibitor lapatinib. Cells were harvested at 12 hours post–TGF-β, when a
peak of ERBB1/2 tyrosine phosphorylation was observed
(Fig. 1B), and the phosphorylation status of ERK1/2 was evaluated. As shown in Fig. 4A, TGF-β caused an increase in
ERK1/2 phosphorylation, which was dose-dependently negated by lapatinib (top row); analogous results were observed
with erlotinib and Akt phosphorylation (data not shown).
This effect was not due to impaired signaling at the level of
the TGF-β receptor complex, as lapatinib (nor erlotinib) did
not alter the level of SMAD3 phosphorylation (Fig. 4A, second
row from bottom and data not shown, respectively).
To further confirm the functional relevance of ERBB activation by TGF-β, shRNAs targeting ErbB1, ErbB2, or both were
stably expressed in AKR-2B cells. Figure 4B shows that, com-

7426

Cancer Res; 70(19) October 1, 2010

pared with either nontransduced or cells expressing a nontargeting shRNA, inhibition of ERBB1 expression partially
prevented activation of ERK1/2 by TGF-β. This is in contrast
to ERBB2 silencing, in which TGF-β–stimulated ERK1/2 phosphorylation was essentially abolished. The partial effect of
ERBB1 shRNA is of interest and likely due to (a) the more limited decrease in ERBB1 by RNAi alone (i.e., second row from
bottom, lanes 5 and 7) as lanes 6 and 8 reflect the combined effects of shRNA silencing and ligand-induced downregulation/
degradation and/or (b) the primary signaling response emanating from ligand-activated ERBB2 heterodimers. Supporting these hypotheses, inhibition of ERBB2 expression was
more efficient (first row from bottom) and completely abrogated the activation of ERK1/2 by TGF-β (top row, shErbB2).
The data from double knockdown cells (shErbB1 + shErbB2)
were also in line with these observations. Thus, the results
suggest that activation of ERBB by TGF-β in fibroblasts is
functionally relevant and signaling via ERBB in this context
may require formation of ERBB1-ERBB2 heterodimers.

TGF-β Fibroblast Signaling Requires ERBB Receptors

TGF-β elicits morphologic transformation and AIG of
fibroblast cells via ERBB
Having established the importance of ERBBs in transducing signals originating from the TGF-β receptor complex (Fig.
4), we sought to explore their roles in mediating biological responses of fibroblasts to TGF-β. To this end, we evaluated the
effect of ERBB kinase inhibition on morphologic transformation, a phenotypic change associated with TGF-β–induced cytoskeletal alterations characteristic of myofibroblasts (28).
AKR-2B cells were treated with TGF-β for 48 hours in the
presence or absence of lapatinib, and the effect on cell morphology was analyzed by phase-contrast microscopy. In
agreement with previous findings (21, 28), TGF-β stimulation
caused “cobblestone”-shaped AKR-2B cells (Fig. 5A, a–c) to
adopt a spindle-like, elongated myofibroblastic morphology
(Fig. 5A, d and e). In contrast, addition of lapatinib substantially reduced the induction of these morphologic changes by
TGF-β (Fig. 5A, f), indicating a role of ERBB1/2 in the process.
Interestingly, these modifications were associated with subcellular alterations indicative of extensive remodeling of the
cytoskeleton, as evidenced by changes in the F-actin structure. Specifically, labeling of F-actin with phalloidin revealed
that TGF-β triggered a transition of actin fibers from a disor-

ganized (Fig. 5A, g–i) to a more defined structure (Fig. 5A,
j and k), with fibers assuming a parallel orientation along
the longitudinal axis of the spindle-shaped cells (Fig. 5A, d
and e) in the latter case. Importantly, the formation of these
organized structures was significantly impaired in the presence of lapatinib (Fig. 5A, l), suggesting a role of the ERBB
pathway in mediating these effects.
As ERBBs have a well-documented role in promoting cell
proliferation and survival (13, 26), we investigated whether
their activation by TGF-β might contribute to the induction
of fibroblast cell AIG (22). The ability of AKR-2B cells to form
soft agar colonies in response to TGF-β stimulation was assessed in the presence or absence of lapatinib. As shown in
Fig. 5B, lapatinib potently counteracted the induction of AIG
by TGF-β with maximal inhibition at 1 to 3 μmol/L. The dose
dependency of AIG inhibition (Fig. 5B) was comparable with
that of ERK1/2 activation (Fig. 4A), which was used as a surrogate marker for ERBB activation (13). These findings were
further substantiated by data from experiments using ErbB
knockdown cells. Whereas TGF-β–stimulated AIG was dramatically decreased in AKR-2B cells silenced for ErbB1, basal
colony formation was also lowered such that a discernible
“fold increase” could be argued in the sh-ErbB1 clones.

cells were left untreated or treated with TGF-β
(10 ng/mL) for 12 h following a 45-min
preincubation with different concentrations of
the dual ERBB1/2-specific kinase inhibitor
lapatinib or DMSO (0.025%, vehicle). Total
proteins (50 μg) were analyzed by Western
blotting using antibodies specific for
phosphorylated ERK1/2 (p-ERK1/2), total

or total SMAD3. B, AKR-2B cells stably
transduced with lentivirus-based shRNA
targeting ErbB1 (sh-ErbB1; clones 1 and 2),
ErbB2 (sh-ErbB2; clones 1 and 2), or both
(sh-ErbB1 + sh-ErbB2) were treated with TGF-β
(10 ng/mL) for 6 or 12 h and harvested for
total protein extraction. Untransduced AKR-2B
cells (Untr) and cells transduced with
nontargeting sequences (NT-Ctrl) were used as
controls. Equivalent protein aliquots (50 μg)
were subjected to Western blot analysis using
antibodies specific for phosphorylated ERK1/2
(p-ERK1/2), total ERK1/2, phosphorylated
SMAD3 (p-SMAD3), or total SMAD3. ERBB1
and ERBB2 antibodies were used to determine
silencing efficiency for both genes. GAPDH
served as an internal control. Note: the
6-h samples were used to evaluate SMAD3
phosphorylation, whereas the remaining study
was performed on 12-h samples.

TGF-β Fibroblast Signaling Requires ERBB Receptors

Although the biological significance of this increase is suspected as the counts are similar to non–TGF-β–treated controls, both absolute and fold AIG were fully abolished in
ErbB2 and ErbB1+ ErbB2 knockdown cells (Fig. 5C). Together,
these results strongly implicate ERBB receptors in mediating
biological responses of fibroblasts to TGF-β.

Discussion
It has been proposed that above 45% of all deaths in the
Western world can be attributed to some type of chronic fibroproliferative disorder (29). However, as the number of effective therapies is limited, identification of mechanisms
regulating biological responses of fibroblasts to TGF-β may
provide unique opportunities for therapeutic intervention in
fibrosis and various types of desmoplastic cancers (1–4).
Here, we report for the first time that ERBBs act as critical
mediators of fibroblast responses to TGF-β, thereby introducing a novel conceptual framework for understanding
the mechanisms underlying fibrogenesis. Of note, while exposing hitherto unknown aspects of TGF-β–regulated cellular processes in fibroblasts, our findings are consistent with
previous observations made by other investigators in distinct
biological systems (19, 20).
The striking similarity between the kinetics of ERBB ligand
induction and receptor phosphorylation/activation (Fig. 1
and Supplementary Fig. S2) strongly suggests a causative relationship. However, although upregulation of ligands (transcriptional/posttranscriptional) may seem to be the chief
mechanism regulating ERBB activation by TGF-β, additional
mechanisms are also likely to come into play given the complex biology of ERBB ligands (14, 30). ERBB ligands are synthesized as membrane-tethered precursors, which are processed
into mature ligands via proteolytic cleavage by “sheddases” of
the “a disintegrin and metalloprotease” (ADAM) family (31).
Whether the appropriate sheddase(s) in fibroblasts is (are)
constitutively active or coregulated with the ligands by TGFβ is unknown and is the subject of our current investigations.
In that regard, the hypothesis of a TGF-β–dependent regulation is supported by the observation that ERBB1 activation
was consistently delayed (Figs. 1B and 2B) despite the early
induction of one of its ligands, HBEGF (Figs. 1A and 2A and
Supplementary Fig. S2). It should also be noted that TGF-β
was previously reported to activate ADAM17/tumor necrosis
factor-α converting enzyme in mammary epithelial cells (32).
Induction of ERBB ligands by TGF-β is characterized by a
cell tropism, occurring in fibroblast but not epithelial cells
(Figs. 1 and 2 and Supplementary Fig. S2), and is achieved
via the canonical SMAD pathway (Fig. 3). Because our previous studies have shown that several non-SMAD pathways
were differentially turned on by TGF-β and controlled specific cellular processes in fibroblasts (21, 23–25), the observa-

tion that ERBB activation in fibroblasts displays both cell
tropism and SMAD dependency is suggestive of another level
of regulation being operative. Although the manner of regulation is currently unknown, epigenetic events that allow
preferential induction of ERBB ligands in fibroblasts or that
prevent/suppress their expression in epithelial cells may be
proposed as a potential mechanism. Such a premise is supported by earlier findings showing that the methylation status of the platelet-derived growth factor B gene promoter
dictates the ability of TGF-β to induce expression of this
gene and regulate proliferation in glioma cells (33). However,
the contribution of non-SMAD pathways (21, 23–25) to ERBB
ligand induction in fibroblasts cannot be fully excluded.
This study establishes the role of ERBB receptors in mediating the effect of TGF-β on morphologic transformation and
AIG of fibroblasts (Fig. 5). It should be noted, however, that
whereas lapatinib prevented both of the aforementioned
TGF-β responses (Fig. 5A and B), ERBB1 and/or ERBB2 knockdown was only effective in inhibiting soft agar colony formation (Fig. 5C and data not shown). Although the significance of
this is currently not known, it indicates that the actions of
TGF-β are regulated by the differing thresholds of ERBB activity. As the importance of TGF-β in fibroproliferative diseases
derives from its ability to modulate cellular processes such as
myofibroblast differentiation and fibroblast proliferation (3),
these observations may have profound in vivo implications.
Sustained activation of the ERBB axis by TGF-β may indeed
contribute to the induction/maintenance of a myofibroblastic
phenotype in fibrotic lesions and during desmoplastic reaction
in cancer (1–4). Furthermore, as ERBB inhibitors are most often used in conditions where receptor amplification is observed, the current findings suggest that they may also be
effective in tumors with normal ERBB expression whose proliferation and/or invasion is directly activated by these stromalderived ligands. Additional exploration of the mechanism(s)
controlling ERBB activation in each of these contexts will
greatly assist efforts to identify potential therapeutic targets.
