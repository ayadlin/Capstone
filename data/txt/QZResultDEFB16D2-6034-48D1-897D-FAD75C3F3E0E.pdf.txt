Abstract
Gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST) are characterized by
activating mutations of KIT or platelet-derived growth factor
receptor A (PDGFRA), and treatment with the tyrosine kinase
inhibitor imatinib yields responses in the majority of patients.
However, most patients develop secondary resistance, which
is associated with a dismal prognosis. Histone deacetylase
inhibitors (HDACI) have been shown to enhance imatinib
activity in imatinib-resistant chronic myelogenous leukemia.
Against this background, we explored whether HDACI might
provide an alternative therapeutic strategy to KIT/PDGFRA
kinase inhibitors in GIST. Inhibition of cell proliferation by
HDACI was seen in KIT-positive but not in KIT-negative GIST
cell lines, suggesting that HDACI activity is mainly conferred
by targeting oncogenic KIT. KIT activity, expression, and
activation of downstream pathways were strongly inhibited by
several HDACI (SAHA, LBH589, VPA, trichostatin A, and
NaButyrate). SAHA and LBH589 induced apoptosis in KITpositive GIST, and strong synergism with imatinib was
observed at low concentrations of SAHA and LBH589.
Mechanistically, treatment with HDACI reduced KIT mRNA
transcript levels and led to strong acetylation of HSP90,
interfering with its activity as KIT chaperone. These results
provide preclinical evidence for a disease-specific effect of
HDACI in KIT-positive GIST, which could translate into
therapeutic activity. [Cancer Res 2009;69(17):6941–50]

Introduction
Activating mutations of KIT or platelet-derived growth factor
receptor A (PDGFRA) represent the key oncogenic events in
gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST; refs. 1, 2). The imatinib
mesylate (IM) small molecule inhibitor of KIT and PDGFRA yields
long-lasting responses in the majority of patients, with a median
survival of almost 5 years (3). However, 20% of patients
have primary resistance to IM, and most responding patients
eventually develop secondary resistance and progress. Second line

therapy with sunitinib yields 7% responses, but patients progress
after a median of 6 months with a dismal outcome at time
of progression. Therefore, alternative treatment strategies are
urgently needed (4).
Secondary mutations within the split kinase domain (exon 13
and 17) of KIT account for acquired IM resistance in most patients
(5, 6). Although mutations within the ATP-binding pocket (exon 13,
exon 14) are generally sensitive to novel direct KIT inhibitors such
as sunitinib and nilotinib, mutations within the activation loop
(exon 17) are often crossresistant to these newer generation KIT
inhibitors (7, 8). Overall, sensitivity to KIT kinase inhibitors varies
considerably depending on the type of secondary mutation.
Therefore individual KIT kinase inhibitor drugs are not likely to
inhibit the myriad KIT drug resistance mutations that can be
shown, even within the same patient (6). To avoid the pharmacologic challenge of genomic heterogeneity, novel therapeutic
strategies include inhibition of heat shock protein 90, which has
been shown to inhibit oncogenic KIT, irrespective of the underlying
secondary mutation (9).
Histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACI) represent a promising
novel class of anticancer agents, several of which are currently
undergoing clinical trials in malignant diseases. Acetylation of
lysine residues of core histone proteins leads to relaxed chromatin
structure and enables transcription (10). HDACI exhibit an
apparent selectivity for tumor repressing or cell cycle inhibitory
genes (e.g., gelsolin, CDKN1A/p21WAF1, or CDKN2A/p16; ref. 11). In
addition, a plethora of nonhistone proteins that play a key role in
oncogenesis and cancer progression are targets of acetylation and
deacetylation (e.g., p53, HSP90; ref. 12), and HDACI may exert their
activity through these proteins as well (13).
Suberoyl hydroxamic acid (SAHA) is the first HDACI that was
approved by the Food and Drug Administration, and is now
included in the treatment of recurrent and advanced cutaneous
T-cell lymphoma (14). Notably, SAHA has been shown to inhibit
IM-resistant BCR/ABL and induce apoptosis in BCR/ABL-positive
leukemia cell lines (15).
Against this background, we sought to evaluate the therapeutic
relevance of HDACI in GISTs in vitro.

HDAC Inhibition in GIST
progressed, after initial clinical response, during IM therapy. GIST48 has a
primary, homozygous exon 11 missense mutation (V560D) and a
heterozygous secondary exon 17 (kinase activation loop) mutation
(D820A). GIST48B is a subline of GIST48, which, despite retaining the
activating KIT mutation in all cells, expresses KIT transcript (data not
shown) and protein at essentially undetectable levels. GIST62 was also
derived from a KIT-positive GIST with a KIT exon 11 in-frame mutation that
has subsequently lost KIT expression (9). GIST522 was established from an
IM-resistant, progressing GIST and contains a primary heterozygous KIT
exon 11 mutation (delEVQWK554-558). However, the KIT oncoprotein has
been transcriptionally silenced. The KIT-negative cell lines serve as a
negative control for evaluation of KIT inhibitors, but in a GIST cell context.
Leiomyosarcoma cell lines LMS03 and SK-LMS-1 were established from
high-grade leiomyosarcomas, LPS141 from a dedifferentiated liposarcoma,
and RMS176 from an embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma.
Reagents and antibodies. IM and LBH589 were kindly provided by
Novartis Pharma. SAHA was from Alexis, and Trichostatin A (TSA) and
valproic acid (VPA) were purchased from Calbiochem (Merck). A rabbit
polyclonal antibody to KIT was from DAKO. Polyclonal rabbit antibodies to
phospho-KIT Y703 and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) were from
Zymed Laboratories. Polyclonal rabbit antibodies to total p42/44 mitogenactivated protein kinase (MAPK), phospho-p44/42 MAPK T202/Y204,
phospho-AKT S473, total AKT, phospho-PKCu (Thr538), cleaved caspase
3, phospho-KIT Y719, acetylated-lysine, and Histone H3 were from Cell
Signaling. Polyclonal goat antibody for total PKCu, HSP70 monoclonal
mouse antibody, and polyclonal rabbit antibody against HDAC6 were from

Santa Cruz Biotechnology. p21 and h-actin antibodies were purchased from
Sigma. Acetylated Histone H3 antibody was from Upstate Biotechnology. A
HSP90 antibody was from Stressgen.
In vitro assays. Viability studies were carried out using the CellTiterGlo luminescent assay (Promega), in which the luciferase-catalyzed
luciferin/ATP reaction provides an indicator of cell number (18). For
these studies, the cell lines were plated at 15 to 30,000 cells per well in a
96-well flat-bottomed plate (Falcon), cultured in serum-containing media
for 1 to 2 d, and then incubated for 72 h with HDAC, or KIT inhibitors or
DMSO-only solvent control. The CellTiter-Glo assay luminescence was
measured with a Genion Luminometer (Tecan) and the data were
normalized to the DMSO-only control group. All experimental points were
measured in quadruplicate wells for each plate and were replicated in at
least two plates.
Apoptosis studies were done by measuring caspase 3 and caspase 7
activation with the Caspase-Glo 3/7 Assay kit (Promega). This assay uses a
proluminescent substrate containing the DEVD sequence recognized and
activated by caspase 3 and caspase 7 (19, 20) and the luminescence signal is
proportional to net caspase 3 and caspase 7 activation (21). The
experimental conditions were all as described above for the CellTiter-Glo
studies except treatment duration of 24 and 48 h.
Western blotting and immunoprecipitation. Protein lysates were
prepared from cell line monolayers according to standard protocols (22).
Protein concentrations were determined with the Bio-Rad Protein Assay
(Bio-Rad Laboratories). Electrophoresis and immunoblotting were carried
out as previously described (23). Changes in protein expression and

V FITC (525 nm) and 7-AAD (675 nm) were added. After incubation at room
temperature for 15 min, Annexin V–positive cells were estimated by flow
cytometry. Ten thousand events of each sample were acquired on a
BeckmanCoulter FC500 Flow Cytometer. Doublet discrimination was done
with FL2 versus FL2 peak histogram.
Quantitative real-time reverse transcriptase-PCR. Cells were plated
in 12-well plates, grown until 80% confluence, and then treated with drugcontaining media. Cells were then collected with RNAprotect Cell reagent

manufacturer’sf protocol, for RNA isolation. cDNA was transcribed by
reverse Transcriptase-PCR using random primers and KIT-cDNA was
amplified and measured using TaqMan gene expression assays (Applied
Biosystems) and real-time PCR system LightCycler 480 (Roche). Beta Actin
cDNA [also measured using Taqman gene expression assay (AB)] served as
reference gene for relative quantification.

HDAC Inhibition in GIST

Results
HDACI exhibit antiproliferative effects in KIT-positive
cell lines. We first evaluated the antiproliferative effects of SAHA
in GIST cell lines by treating cells for 72 hours with increasing
concentrations of SAHA (10 nmol/L–10 Amol/L), as well as with
500 nmol/L of IM alone and in combination with 2.5 Amol/L of SAHA.
SAHA treatment resulted in strong antiproliferative effects in
IM-sensitive GIST882 and GIST-T1 (IC50, 3.5 and 1.7 Amol/L,
respectively) and IM-resistant GIST48 (IC50, 3.2 Amol/L) but not in
KIT-negative GIST48B, GIST62, and GIST522 (IC50, >10 Amol/L;
Fig. 1A). Combination of SAHA with IM (500 nmol/L) yielded
slightly additive effects (Fig. 1B) in KIT-positive cell lines but not in
KIT-negative GIST48B. For combination studies, a clinically
relevant dose of IM that substantially inhibits KIT signaling in
IM-sensitive but not IM-resistant GIST was used.
Sarcomas other than GIST are less sensitive to HDACI. To
study GIST-independent effects of HDACI, we then compared
SAHA antiproliferative effects in GIST to those induced in several
other soft tissue sarcoma cell lines (Fig. 1C). IC50s ranged from 2.8
Amol/L in the rhabdomyosarcoma cell line RMS176 to 5 Amol/L in
the leiomyosarcoma cell line SK-LMS-1 but were not reached in
LMS03 and LPS141 (inhibition of 35% and 24% at 10 Amol/L).
HDAC-inhibition induces apoptosis in KIT-positive but not
in KIT-negative GIST, which is enhanced by imatinib. To study

induction of apoptosis by HDACI, cells were plated in 96-well
plates and treated with SAHA at concentrations ranging from 1 to
5 Amol/L singly or in combination with 500 nmol/L of IM for 24
and 48 hours and then analyzed for caspase 3/7 activation. In
GIST882, SAHA alone resulted in a maximum of 5.9-fold induction,
compared with control, and IM treatment showed a 3.7-fold
induction. Notably, combination of 5 Amol/L of SAHA and 500
nmol/L of IM after 48 hours resulted in a 15-fold induction of
activated caspase 3/7, compared with vehicle control.
In IM-resistant GIST48, additive effects of combination treatment with 500 nmol/L of IM and 5 Amol/L of SAHA (13-fold) after
24 hours were less pronounced than those seen in GIST882,
compared with IM and SAHA alone (5-fold and 11-fold increase,
respectively; Fig. 2A). Notably, combinations of imatinib with lower
doses of SAHA (1 and 2 Amol/L) resulted in synergistic
proapoptotic effects.
We further evaluated apoptosis in cell lysates from GIST cells
that were treated with SAHA for 18 hours. SAHA at concentrations
of z2 Amol/L resulted in dose-dependent cleavage of caspase 3
and the caspase substrate PARP (86-kDa fragment) when measured
by Western blot in GIST882, GIST-T1, and GIST48 (Fig. 2B).
Combination of 500 nmol/L of IM and SAHA at 2 Amol/L induced
caspase 3 cleavage comparable with that induced by 10 Amol/L
of SAHA alone. GIST48 caspase cleavage was demonstrable at

Figure 5. Effects of different inhibitors on KIT mRNA and protein levels. A and B, quantitative real-time reverse transcription-PCR evaluation of KIT mRNA in
KIT-positive GIST. Time course study (4, 8 and 12 h of treatment) with 500 nmol/L of IM and two concentrations of SAHA (2 and 5 Amol/L). A, comparison of
KIT-inhibitor IM, HSP90-inhibitor 17-AAG, and HDAC-inhibitors SAHA and LBH589 on KIT-RNA levels after 12 h of treatment (B). Values were normalized to the DMSO

2 Amol/L of SAHA, with a 2-fold induction at 5 Amol/L and a
synergistic effect when 2 Amol/L of SAHA were combined with
IM, with the combination exceeding cleavage levels seen with
10 Amol/L of SAHA alone. In contrast, no induction of apoptosis
markers was seen in KIT-negative GIST48B (Fig. 2B). Representative apoptosis studies were also performed with LBH589 in
GIST882, which at 500 nmol/L showed a 7.4-fold induction of
caspase 3 cleavage and 7.8-fold induction of PARP cleavage.
Again, synergistic induction was shown when LBH589 was
combined with IM (Supplementary Fig. S1).
We further performed apoptosis assessment by Annexin V/7AAD staining in GIST882. Forty-eight hours of treatment with IM
(500 nmol/L), SAHA (2 Amol/L), and LBH589 (25 nmol/L) resulted
in moderate induction of early apoptosis (15%, 7%, and 20%,
respectively) when given singly (Supplementary Fig. S2). In
contrast, combinations of IM with SAHA or LBH589 at the same
dose levels showed a synergistic proapoptotic effect resulting in
early apoptosis in 38% (IM plus SAHA) and 49% (IM plus LBH589)
of GIST 882 cells.
For cell cycle analyses, GIST882 cells were treated for 48 hours
with DMSO, IM (500 nmol/L), SAHA (2 Amol/L), and LBH589

Cancer Res 2009; 69: (17). September 1, 2009

(25 nmol/L), which resulted a low sub-G1 fraction (1%, 13%, 2%,
and 5%), whereas combinations of both SAHA and LBH589
resulted in additive increase of sub-G1 cells (29% and 36%). With
regard to effects of inhibitors on cell cycle distribution, IM
showed a strong reduction of the S phase, whereas other
inhibitors did not. No other substantial changes were observed
(Supplementary Fig. S3).
HDACI inhibit KIT- and KIT-dependent signaling pathways.
To elucidate the mechanism of HDACI-induced sensitization to
apoptosis, we investigated the effects of HDACIs on KIT and KITdepending signaling pathways. To avoid confounding effects of cell
apoptosis and general disruption of the cellular architecture, an
early time point (18 hours) was chosen as used in similar
experiments by other groups (13). In GIST882, GIST-T1, and
GIST48, SAHA treatment resulted in marked inhibition of KITphosphorylation (GIST882 and GIST-T1: IC50, 1.7 Amol/L, near total
inhibition at 5 Amol/L; GIST48: IC50, 3 Amol/L, 81% inhibition at
5 Amol/L), which was paralleled by substantial inhibition of
phospho-AKT and phospho-MAPK (Fig. 3A), and by decreased total
KIT expression (70% and 80% decrease at 5 Amol/L in GIST-T1,
GIST882, and GIST48) involving equally the mature (160 kDa) and

HDAC Inhibition in GIST

immature (145 kDa) forms of KIT. LBH589 showed a similar, dosedependent effect on KIT and KIT-depending signaling at 20-fold
lower concentrations (IC50 for inhibition of p-KIT, 105 nmol/L; total
KIT, 190 nmol/L; pAKT, 30 nmol/L; pMAPK, 190 nmol/L;
Supplementary Fig. S1).
In KIT-negative GIST48B, no detectable levels of phosphorylated
KIT and minimal levels of total KIT were found. SAHA treatment
caused a minor decrease in phospho-MAPK starting at 2 Amol/L,
with partial inhibition at 5 Amol/L (Fig. 3A).
Time course studies on GIST882 cells were performed to
determine the onset of KIT inhibition in correlation to histone
acetylation. Cells were treated for 30 minutes to 24 hours with
5 Amol/L SAHA (Fig. 3B). Immunoblots for KIT and for KITdepending signaling pathways revealed near total inhibition of
phospho-KIT, total KIT, pAKT, and pMAPK after 9 hours. Caspase
cleavage was shown at 12 hours and peaked at 24 hours. Induction
of cell cycle protein p21 started at 3 hours of treatment. Notably,
acetylation of core histone protein H3 was observed at the 12-hour
time point and peaked at 24 hours.
Effects of a HDACI panel on GIST viability. We then evaluated
other HDACI, including TSA, VPA, sodium butyrate (NaB), and
LBH589, which showed IC50s between high nmol/L (LBH589, TSA)
to low mmol/L (NaB, VPA) concentrations, with only minor
differences seen between IM-sensitive and IM-resistant cells
(Fig. 4A and B). Additive antiproliferative effects were seen with
all HDACI and IM in GIST48 (Fig. 4C). Notably, LBH589, a thirdgeneration pan-deacetylase inhibitor, was 22 and 39 times more
potent than SAHA against GIST48 and GIST882 respectively
(Fig. 4A and B).
Effects of HDACI on histone H3 acetylation. The lowest SAHA
concentrations inducing histone H3 acetylation were 1 Amol/L in
GIST882, 0.5 Amol/L in GIST-T1, GIST48, and GIST48B (Fig. 2B),
and for LBH589 were 10 nmol/L in GIST882 and GIST48
(Supplementary Fig. S1). Notably, minor induction of total H3
was observed. Of note, combination treatment of HDACI (SAHA
and LBH589) and IM resulted in synergistic induction of histone
acetylation (Supplementary Fig. S1; Fig. 2B). Although LBH589 at
100 nmol/L resulted in 5.5-fold induction of histone acetylation,

the combination with IM resulted in 15-fold induction (Supplementary Fig. S1).
GIST histone H3 acetylation and KIT inhibition differ after
treatment with various HDACI. The effects of several HDACI
were compared on pKIT, pAKT, acetylated, and total histone
H3 (Fig. 4D) after 18 hours of treatment, using two concentrations
for each HDACI, around the IC50s established previously in the
GIST882 proliferation studies. Inhibition of pKIT was by far
strongest for cells treated with SAHA, whereas other HDACI
showed only minor pKIT inhibition. Notably, KIT-inhibition
differed between SAHA 2 Amol/L, TSA 300 nmol/L, VPA
3 mmol/L, and NaB at 1 mmol/L despite comparable levels of
histone acetylation. Interestingly, moderate inhibition of pKIT
was accompanied by complete inhibition of pAKT following
treatments with NaB and VPA (Fig. 4D).
SAHA decreases KIT-RNA in a time and dose-dependent
manner. To evaluate the effect of HDAC inhibition on KIT
transcript levels, real-time PCR was performed following treatment
of GIST882 with SAHA 2 and 5 Amol/L for 4, 8, and 12 hours
(Fig. 5A). KIT transcripts decreased in a time and dose-dependent
manner in GIST882, with a decrease of 70% using SAHA 2 Amol/L
and 84% using SAHA 5 Amol/L, after 12 hours of treatment
(Fig. 5A). By contrast, GIST882 treatment with IM at this time
showed no reduction compared with DMSO. We then compared
SAHA effects at 12 hours with LBH589 and 17-AAG and found a
similarly strong decrease of KIT mRNA levels following LBH589, but
not after 17-AAG, in GIST 882 and GIST48 (Fig. 5B). The KIT-negative
liposarcoma cell line LPS141 showed 10 4 times lower levels of KIT
mRNA levels compared with the untreated GIST cell lines (Fig. 5B).
Given the important role of PKCu in the regulation of KIT
expression (24), we also investigated the effects of HDACI on PKCu
expression and phosphorylation (Supplementary Fig. S4). Notably,
SAHA and LBH589 were shown to reduce expression of both total
and phosphorylated PKCu by 20% to 40%.
To evaluate the half-life of KIT following block of translation, we
treated GIST882 with 100 Amol/L cycloheximide in a time course
experiment and found >80% reduction of total KIT after 3 hours
and near-total loss after 6 hours (Fig. 5C).

HDACI inhibit KIT through acetylation of HSP90. To
investigate possible nonhistone-related KIT inhibitory mechanisms,
we treated GIST882 with SAHA 5 Amol/L for 12 hours, then
performed immunoprecipitation for HSP90, and counterstained
with antiacetyl lysine and HDAC6. Substantial increase of HSP90
acetylation was shown following SAHA treatment (Fig. 6), whereas
HDAC6 dissociated from HSP90 (Fig. 6A). These findings were
confirmed by immunoprecipitation of HDAC6, where we showed
commensurate dissociation of HSP90 (Fig. 6B). KIT immunoprecipitations revealed increased binding of HSP70 to KIT, whereas
HSP90 was found to slightly dissociate when normalized to relative
levels of KIT (Fig. 6C).

Discussion
Identification of KIT as a crucial oncogenic regulator pathway
has revolutionized the treatment of GIST (25). The KIT inhibitor
imatinib has tripled the median survival of patients with metastatic
GIST and many patients live 5 years or longer with the disease.
However, most patients inevitably develop resistance. Resistance is
mostly conferred by secondary mutations within the split kinase
domain of KIT (5, 6, 26). Although resistance mutations within the
ATP-binding domain (T670I, V654A) can successfully be targeted
by alternative KIT inhibitors such as sunitinib, mutations within
the activation loop are an ongoing pharmacologic challenge
(28–30). In addition, less than nine different resistance mutations
have already been described and different mutations may even
occur within the same patient (5, 6, 30). Direct, ATP-competitive
inhibitors are therefore unlikely to sufficiently inhibit all possible
KIT mutations.
Alternative strategies aim to inhibit the oncogenic signal of KIT
regardless of existing secondary mutations. Among those are
inhibitions of KIT-dependent signaling pathways (e.g., PI3K, AKT,
or mammalian target of rapamycin; refs. 31, 32) or indirect
inhibition of KIT using HSP90 inhibitors (9, 33, 34) that are already
being tested clinically.
The posttranslational modification of histones, e.g., through
acetylation and deacetylation of lysine tails, has been shown to be
an important mechanism of transcriptional regulation (35).
Interestingly, many genes up-regulated by HATs are important for
differentiation, cell cycle control, and apoptosis (36). Aberrant
acetylation, either through overexpression of HDAC or HAT
dysfunction is commonly found in epithelial and hematologic
cancers (37–39). In this context, HDACIs exhibit an apparent
selectivity for activating transcription of tumor-suppressing
genes (36).
Recently, several groups have highlighted the potential therapeutic relevance of HDACIs in IM-resistant chronic myelogenous
leukemia cells. HDACI destabilized the BCR-ABL oncoprotein even
in the presence of the highly IM-resistant T315I gatekeeper
mutation (13, 40, 41). Given the similarities of the oncogenic
tyrosine kinase mechanisms between CML and GIST, we therefore
investigated the potential therapeutic value of HDACI in GIST.
The data reported herein are the first to show strong
antiproliferative and proapoptotic effects in both IM-sensitive
and IM-resistant GIST by inhibitors of histone deacetylases. We
show that these effects are conferred by inactivation of the KIToncogenic signaling cascade. The inactivation mechanisms include
both inhibition of KIT transcript expression and also degradation
of KIT oncoproteins via suppression of deacetylation of the KIT
chaperone HSP90.

KIT-positive GIST lines were sensitive to HDACI (IC50, 1.7–3.5
Amol/L), whereas KIT-negative GIST lines were unresponsive
(Fig. 1). These findings compare well with data from other
SAHA-sensitive cancer cell lines, for which IC50s (SAHA) in the
low micromolar dose range were described (15, 40, 42). These dose
levels are considered to be therapeutically achievable. Antiproliferative effects of HDACI were lower in non-GIST sarcomas, with only
10% to 20% inhibition after treating leiomyosarcoma (LMS03) and
liposarcoma (LPS141) cell lines with 10 Amol/L SAHA indicating
that GISTs are uniquely susceptible to HDACI.
In KIT-positive GISTs, HDACI treatment induced dosedependent inhibition of KIT phosphorylation, paralleled by AKT
inhibition (Fig. 3A). In GIST882, inhibition of AKT-phosphorylation
was even more pronounced with all HDACI used than inhibition
of KIT phosphorylation (Supplementary Fig. S1; Figs. 3 and 4),
suggesting that HDACI may have inhibitory effects on the PI3KAKT pathway independent of KIT inhibition. Interestingly, in
studies with different HDACI, the effects on histone acetylation did
not strictly correlate with KIT inhibition, suggesting that KIT
inhibitory effects are partly histone independent and perhaps
dependent on certain HDAC subtypes. Although TSA, SAHA, and
LBH589 are pan HDACI, VPA and NaB only inhibit class I HDACs.
Our studies suggest that HDACI have several mechanisms
contributing to KIT inhibition: Histone acetylation may cause
reduced KIT transcription, most likely by affecting expression of
KIT transcriptional repressors. HDACI might also regulate
oncoprotein function, e.g., by modifying KIT acetylation, and may
influence KIT oncogenic signaling through effects on nonhistone
HDACI targets.
Direct, ATP-competitive inhibitors of KIT, such as IM, are known
to have KIT inhibitory effects within several minutes of treatment
(data not shown). Time course studies with HDACI (Fig. 3B)
showed onset of KIT inhibition after 3 and 6 hours of treatment,
with a maximum effect between 12 and 18 hours. Only subtle
histone acetylation was seen at the early time points (3–6 h) and
the maximal acetylation level was seen only at the last time point
(24 hours). These findings suggest the possibility of HDACImediated indirect inhibition of KIT rather than a direct,
biochemical inhibition as seen with IM. Notably, signaling studies
showed both inhibition of KIT phosphorylation and decreased KIT
expression. Although direct KIT inhibitors such as IM and sunitinib
do not decrease total KIT expression, we have previously shown
that HSP90 inhibitors strongly decrease KIT expression levels (9).
HSP90 is subject to several posttranslational modifications that
affect its function. Hyperacetylation of HSP90, especially acetylation of the amino acid K294, decreases the affinity for most clients
and certain cochaperones (43, 44). Inhibition of HDAC6, a class II
HDAC, has recently been shown to disrupt the chaperone function
of HSP90 resulting in degradation of HSP90 clients, such as BCRABL (12, 13). This seems to be caused by lower affinity for ATP (40).
As the assembly of the functional HSP90 chaperone complex
requires ATP, HDACI effects on HSP90 can be explained in part by
the inhibition of its complex formation. In line with this model, we
here show that HDACI treatment of GIST cells causes dissociation
of HDAC6 from HSP90 resulting in hyperacetylation of HSP90 and a
consequent loss of KIT (Fig. 6).
Treatment of GIST48B and GIST62 with SAHA resulted in
substantial inhibition of pMAPK (GIST48B and GIST62) and pAKT
(GIST62) despite the lack of measurable KIT activation (data not
shown; Fig. 3A). These findings indicate that apart from HDACI
effects on KIT, other signaling pathways might be affected.

HDAC Inhibition in GIST

Of note, KIT transcript levels were found to be down-regulated in
a time- and dose-dependent fashion, with maximal effects seen
after 12 hours of SAHA treatment (Fig. 3B). Because HDACI are
thought to enable rather than suppress transcription, these effects
can be explained by induction of a gene responsible for KIT
transcriptional repression. The loss of KIT expression seen after
12 hours of treatment with HDACI could be explained both by
transcriptional repression and HSP90 inhibition. However, the
extent of KIT inhibition due to a transcriptional block at this time
point would mainly depend on the half-life of mature KIT in GIST
cells. We therefore treated GIST882 with cycloheximide and
showed that the KIT half-life, in GIST, is <3 hours (Fig. 5C). In
contrast, the HSP90 chaperone (>24 hours) or the KIT regulator
PKCu (>12 hours) exhibited a more than four times longer half-life
following cycloheximide treatment (Fig. 5C). Ou and colleagues
(24) recently reported that PKCu is a major regulator of KIT
transcription. Notably, HDACI caused partial inhibition of PKCu,
and PKCu inhibition may therefore contribute to the inhibition of
KIT expression in GIST.
Mechanisms of resistance to direct KIT inhibitors largely
depend on secondary mutations within the KIT ATP binding
pocket or activation loop. Our studies suggest that HDACImediated inhibition of KIT oncoproteins is independent of the KIT
mutation location, with equal relevance for GISTs with imatinibsensitive or imatinib-resistant KIT mutations. Hence, HDACI
might overcome resistance to both ATP binding pocket and
activation loop imatinib-resistance mutations, providing a new
strategy to inhibit KIT.
Similar to studies evaluating combinations of IM and HDACI in
CML, we found no evidence for antagonistic effects and we
identified additive proapoptotic effects in GIST882 and GIST48
(15, 40, 45). Notably we observed synergistic effects of HDACI and
IM on histone acetylation in the KIT-positive GIST lines (Fig. 3A)
but not in the KIT-negative GIST48B.

We observed induction of p21 by SAHA in all GIST cell lines
(Fig. 2B), including KIT-negative GIST48B and GIST62 (data not
shown; Fig. 2B), and this might result directly from histone
acetylation (46). However, in the KIT-negative GIST48B and GIST62,
p21 induction did not cause marked cell cycle arrest, nor induction
of apoptosis (data not shown; Supplementary Figs. S3 and S4;
Fig. 2B). These findings suggest that inhibition of oncogenic KIT is
the most consequential mechanism of HDACI action in GIST.
Taken together, our data show that HDACI have disease-specific
effects in GIST by inhibiting the crucial KIT oncogenic pathway.
We consistently found additive effects of HDACI and IM in
IM-sensitive GIST, regardless of the HDACI used. LBH589 exhibits
the highest potency of all HDACI tested, although biological effects
of SAHA and LBH589 are similar. Possible mechanisms of action
for HDACI in GIST include acetylation of HSP90 with consequent
destabilization of KIT, but effects on KIT transcriptional activity
may also play a partial role. Given the antiproliferative and
proapoptotic effects of HDACI at doses that can be achieved
therapeutically, our data provide a strong rationale for the clinical
evaluation of HDACI/DACI in GIST.
