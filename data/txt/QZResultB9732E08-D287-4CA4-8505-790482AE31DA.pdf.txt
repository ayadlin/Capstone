ABSTRACT
Bcl-2 associated athanogene 3 (BAG3) contains multiple protein-binding motifs
to mediate potential interactions with chaperons and/or other proteins, which is
possibly ascribed to the multifaceted functions assigned to BAG3. The current study
demonstrated that BAG3 directly interacted with glucose 6 phosphate dehydrogenase
(G6PD), the rate-limiting enzyme of the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP). BAG3
suppressed the PPP flux, de novo DNA synthesis and cell growth in hepatocellular
carcinomas (HCCs). The growth defect of HCCs with forced BAG3 expression can
be rescued by enforced G6PD expression. However, BAG3 elevation did not cause
a reduction in cellular NADPH concentrations, another main product of G6PD. In
addition, supplement of nucleosides alone was sufficient to recover the growth defect
mediated by BAG3 elevation. Collectively, the current study established a tumor
suppressor-like function of BAG3 via direct interaction with G6PD in HCCs at the
cellular level.

INTRODUCTION

Studies on BAG3 has assigned it a variety of
functions, such as regulation of cell cycle, cell survival
and apoptosis, viral replication, and autophagy [2, 21,
32, 34, 39]. The modular structure with multidomain is
believed to be responsible for the pleiotropic functions
attributed to BAG3 [32]. We therefore explore to globally
seek for novel interacting partners of BAG3 and identify
direct interaction of BAG3 with Glucose-6-phosphate
dehydrogenase (G6PD). G6PD is the first and rate-limiting
enzyme of the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP), which
is an offshoot of glucose metabolic pathway important for
both glucose catabolism and macromolecular biosynthesis.
The PPP is also called the hexose monophosphate
shunt, which has a crucial role in generation of ribose-5phosphate (R5P) and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide
phosphate (NADPH). R5P is an essential precursor for
de novo biosynthesis of nucleotides. NADPH provides
the reducing equivalents for reductive biosynthesis
(such as deoxyriboses and fatty acids) and is required
for antioxidant defense by controlling the concentration

Bcl-2 associated athanogene (BAG) proteins share
evolutionarily conserved BAG domain at their C-terminus,
through which BAG proteins interact with ATPase domain
of Hsc/Hsp70 family [38]. Beside conserved BAG domain,
BAG3 contains multiple protein binding motifs to mediate
potential interactions with chaperons and/or other proteins:
a WW domain at the N-terminus, a proline-rich region
(PxxP) in the central region, two IPV motifs (Ile-ProVal) between the WW domain and the PxxP region [10].
Normal cells except for myocytes seldom express BAG3,
while its expression can be induced in many cell types
in response to cell stress [11, 30, 42]. BAG3 induction is
believed to serve as a protective mechanism upon cellular
stress [6, 18, 25, 36–38, 42]. In addition, BAG3 expression
is frequently increased in human tumors [4, 5, 8, 9, 20, 27,
28, 33]. BAG3 protein appears to exert pro-survival and
anti-apoptotic roles, as its reduction promotes apoptosis
of various cancer cells [4, 22–24, 27–29, 31, 36, 42, 43].

BAG3 elevation suppresses DNA biosynthesis
without alteration of cellular NADPH levels in HCCs

of reduced glutathione (GSH) [35]. Cancer cells
create a metabolic phenotype that is essential for quick
proliferation and survival, through substantial alterations
and adaptations in several energy metabolism pathways,
including glucose transport, oxidative phosphorylation and
the PPP [14].
The current study demonstrates that BAG3 directly
interacts with G6PD, and BAG3 elevation suppresses the
PPP flux and proliferation of HCCs via suppression of
G6PD.

As G6PD is the pacesetter of the PPP, we assessed
whether BAG3 might have any influence on the glucose
flux through this pathway. The PPP flux was significantly
slowed down in HCCs with forced BAG3 expression
when compared with their control partners (Figure 3A).
As the PPP generates NADPH and R5P, both of which
are important precursors for DNA biosynthesis, de novo
biosynthesis of DNA was then investigated using Edu
incorporation. EdU incorporation rate was significantly
decreased in HCCs with forced BAG3 expression
when compared with their control partners (Figure 3B).
Unexpectedly, no obvious alterations of cellular NADPH
(Figure 3C), as well as NADP+/NADPH ratio (Figure 3D)
were observed in HCCs with forced BAG3 expression.

RESULTS
BAG3 directly interacts with G6PD in HCCs
Global screen for interactive partners of BAG3
revealed an apparent band with about 60-kDa molecular
mass in BAG3 containing complexes [17] (Figure 1A).
Subsequent peptide mass fingerprinting identified one
of the polypeptides as G6PD, based on 8 peptides with
sequence coverage of 17.7% (Figure 1A). To verify the
interaction between BAG3 and G6PD, HEK293 cells
were co-transfected with BAG3 and G6PD expressing
vectors. Reciprocal immunoprecipitation confirmed
that BAG3 formed complexes with G6PD (Figure 1B).
Pull-down assays demonstrated the interaction between
purified GST-G6PD and His-BAG3 recombinant proteins,
but not GST and His-BAG3 (Figure 1C). In addition,
in situ proximity ligation assay (PLA) demonstrated
that direct interaction of endogenous BAG3 and G6PD
in HCCs including Bel-7402, HepG2 and SMMC-7721
cells (Figure 1D).

BAG3 elevation results in growth inhibition of
HCCs
Cell count revealed that proliferation of HCCs
with forced BAG3 expression was slowed down when
compared with their control partners (Figure 4A–4C). Cell
proliferation was also analyzed using RTCA, and reduction
of cell indexes was observed in Bel-7402 (Figure 4D),
HepG2 (Figure 4E) and SMMC-7721 (Figure 4F) with
forced BAG3 expression. TUNEL staining manifested the
absence of detectable apoptosis in HCCs with forced BAG3
expression (data not shown).

BAG3 regulates DNA biosynthesis and cell
growth via G6PD in HCCs

BAG3 elevation inhibits dimerization and
activity of G6PD in HCCs

To ascertain that the growth retardation is due
to G6PD, G6PD expression (Figure 5A) and activity
(Figure 5B) was restored by retrovirus-mediated gene
transfer (Figure 5A). Forced expression of G6PD almost
completely restored DNA synthesis in HCCs with forced
BAG3 expression, while had a minimal effect on their control
partners (Figure 5C). Cell counts demonstrated that forced
G6PD expression completely recovered the growth inhibition
mediated by BAG3 overexpression in Bel-7402 (Figure 5D),
HepG2 (Figure 5E) and SMMC-7721 (Figure 5F).

To investigate the influence of BAG3 on G6PD,
Bel-7402, HepG2 and SMMC-7721 cells were transduced
with the BAG3 gene using retroviral vectors. Western
blot analyses found that BAG3 elevation decreased both
dimer and monomer of G6PD levels in HCCs (Figure 2A).
G6PD activity assays demonstrated that G6PD activities
were decreased in HCCs with forced BAG3 expression
(Figure  2B). To investigate the influence of BAG3 on
G6PD dimer formation, HCCs were co-transfected
with G6PD constructs with HA and Myc epitope tags.
Immunoprecipitation demonstrated that interaction
between HA-G6PD and Myc-G6PD was significantly
decreased in HCCs with forced BAG3 expression
(Figure 2C). Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate
(NADP+) functions as the cofactor for the formation
of G6PD holoenzyme [15]. GST pull-down assays
demonstrated that the interaction between BAG3 and
G6PD was suppressed by NADP+ in a dose-dependent
manner (Figure 2D).

Supplement of nucleosides rescues growth
inhibition of HCCs mediated by BAG3
overexpression
Cells can uptake nucleosides from culture medium
and convert them to the corresponding nucleotides, thus
bypassing de novo synthesis of ribose for cell proliferation
[7]. Replenishment of nucleoside significantly increased
DNA synthesis in HCCs with forced BAG3 expression
(Figure 6A). In the presence of nucleosides, no obvious

differences in DNA synthesis were observed in HCCs
transferred with empty vector and BAG3 (Figure 6A). Cell
count demonstrated that nucleosides completely restored
cell proliferation in Bel-7402 (Figure 6B), HepG2 (Figure

6C) and SMMC-7721 (Figure 6D) with forced BAG3
expression. Duolink PLA demonstrated that the interaction
between BAG3 and G6PD was unaltered in the presence
of nucleosides in Bel-7402 cells (Figure 6E–6F).

DISCUSSION

specific manner in HCCs. A dimer or tetramer but not a
monomer form of G6PD protein in mammalian cells is
active [1, 16]. Consistent with these reports, we found
that BAG3 hindered dimerization of G6PD in HCCs
(Figure  2C). NADP+ binds to G6PD and functions as a
cofactor for the formation of G6PD holoenzyme [15].
NADP+ suppressed the interaction of BAG3 and G6PD
in a dose-dependent pattern (Figure 2D), suggesting that
NADP+ and BAG3 might competitively bind to G6PD.
Further screening the interactive domains of G6PD and
BAG3 might clarify whether BAG3 prohibits the formation
of G6PD holoenzyme via competing with NADP+ for
binding to G6PD.
The major products of the PPP are R5P and NADPH,
both of which are precursors for DNA biosynthesis.
Consistent with suppression of the PPP flux (Figure 3A),
BAG3 prohibited DNA biosynthesis (Figure 3B) and
cell proliferation (Figure 4) in HCCs. Forced G6PD
overexpression completely recovered DNA synthesis
(Figure 5C) and growth defect (Figure 5D–5F) mediated

Redistribution of glucose utilization is one key
characteristic of cancer cells to coordinate nutrient
utilization with cell physiology [41]. One of mechanisms
used by cells to support the rapid proliferation is redirection
of glucose toward the PPP, which may protect cells from
reactive oxygen species (ROS) by generation of the
reduced form of glutathione using NADPH [3]. The first
rate-limiting enzyme of the PPP is G6PD, which is highly
regulated by many signaling pathways at multiple levels,
including transcription, translation, post-translation,
intracellular location, and interactions with other proteins
[35]. The current study demonstrated that BAG3 directly
interacted with G6PD (Figure 1) and suppressed G6PD
activity in HCCs (Figure 2B). A band between the G6PD
dimer and monomer was obviously detected in HepG2
and SMMC-7721 cells, but undetectable in Bel-7402 cells
(Figure 2A). Therefore, posttranslational modifications
of G6PD such as glycosylation might take place in a cell

by BAG3 elevation, indicating that BAG3 elevation might
suppress the PPP flux and proliferation of HCCs via direct
interaction with G6PD in HCCs. G6PD overexpression
had no obvious effects on DNA biosynthesis (Figure 5C)
and proliferation (Figure 5D–5F) of control HCCs. Du et al
also demonstrated that proliferation of U2OS cells was not
affected by G6PD overexpression [7]. These data were
unexpected as G6PD functions as oncogenic roles in tumor
cells including HCCs [35]. The PPP shunts G6P from
ATP generation to macromolecular biosynthesis, which is
hyperactive in cancer cells either directly or indirectly [40].
The balance between macromolecule biosynthesis and ATP
generation are critical for cell proliferation. Therefore,

it is possible that G6PD activity in control HCCs is enough
to catalyze generation of R5P and NADPH using G6P as
substrate, in case that glucose uptake is not increased.
Consistent with control U2OS and MEF cells
[7], the current study demonstrated that addition of
nucleosides alone had no effect on proliferation of
control HCCs (Figure 6B–6D). BAG3 did not decreased
intracellular NADPH (Figure 3C) and NADP+/NADPH
ratio (Figure 3D). Although the PPP flux is the major
source for NADPH generation in animals, there are several
other processes involved in generation of intracellular
NADPH [13]. Beside glucose catabolism via the PPP,
glutaminolysis is another major mechanism for NADPH

production in tumor cells [44]. Further investigation
of glutamine metabolism might clarify whether BAG3
affects NADPH generation via glutaminolysis. Addition of
nucleosides alone was sufficient to restore de novo DNA
biosynthesis (Figure 6A) and growth of HCCs with forced
BAG3 expression (Figure 6B–6D), while had no obvious
influence on binding of BAG3 to G6PD (Figure 6E–6F).
Therefore, lack of R5P might be the critical missing factor
required for cell growth in HCCs with forced BAG3
expression. Suppression of DNA synthesis (Figure 3A)
was less intensive than decreases in G6PD activity
(Figure 2B), indicating that an alternative route bypass
G6PD might be present to generate R5P in HCCs with
forced BAG3 expression. Consistent with our data, G6PD
activity is reported to be dispensable for pentose synthesis
in mouse embryo stem cells [26].
The current study demonstrated that BAG3 elevation
exhibited a tumor suppressor-like effect on proliferation
of HCCs at the cellular level. The inhibitory role of
BAG3 elevation in cell proliferation at the cellular level
raises the question of why BAG3 is highly expressed
in HCCs [45]. Similar phenomena were also observed
in glioblastoma. BAG3 expression was increased in
glioblastoma tissues [8], while overexpression of BAG3
resulted in a remarkable decrease in the colony formation,
a tumor suppressor-like effect at the cellular level in
glioblastoma [12]. BAG3 contains a modular structure,
through which BAG3 may interact with distinct partners.
It is reasonable that the extent of BAG3 expression
(overexpression or knockdown) may alter its binding
partner(s) differently. Therefore, the specificity of BAG3
interacting clients could justify the difference in the
phenotypic outcome of different biological behaviors.
Supplement of nucleosides was enough to recover
proliferation of HCCs with BAG3 elevation (Figure 6B–6D).
HCCs might have sufficient nucleoside supply and thereby
bypass the requirement of de novo nucleoside biosynthesis
during tumor formation in vivo. Alternatively, the beneficial
influences associated with BAG3 elevation upon stressful
stimuli may outweigh any proliferative defects under
normal condition. As a fact, we previously reported that
BAG3 promoted survival of HepG2 cells upon exposure to
proteasome inhibitors via activation of autophagy [21].
In summary, our data identified that BAG3
suppressed the PPP flux via direct interaction with G6PD,
by which BAG3 elevation suppressed proliferation of
HCCs at the cellular level.

To study the function of BAG3 and G6PD,
retroviral vectors were constructed (Shanghai GeneChem
Co., Ltd., Shanghai, China). GFP or RFP-retroviral
vectors were used as a negative control. All retroviral
vectors expressed GFP or RFP, which allowed us to
measure the infection efficiency. HCCs were infected
at 20 m.o.i with recombinant virus expressing BAG3 or
G6PD for 48 h. Then cells were harvested and subjected
to further analysis.

Coimmunoprecipitation assay and peptide mass
fingerprinting
Coimmunoprecipitation assay was performed as
previously reported [17]. Coomassie-stained protein
bands were excised and analyzed by Matrix-assisted laser
desorption ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass
spectrometry as previously described [17].

Western blot analysis and immunoprecipitation
Cells were lysed in lysis buffer containing 20 mM
Tris-HCl, 150 mM NaCl, 2 mM EDTA, 1% Triton-X100
and protease inhibitor cocktail (Sigma-Aldrich, Saint
Louis, MO). Extracted protein amounts were quantified
using the BCA protein assay kit (Pierce). Equivalent
amounts of protein (25 μg) were separated using 12%
SDS-PAGE and transferred to PVDF membrane (Millipore
Corporation, Billerica, MA). For immunoprecipitation,
cell lysates were pre-cleared with protein A-Sepharose
CL-4B (Amersham Biosciences, Uppsala, Sweden), then
incubated overnight at 4°C with Myc or Flag antibody
and protein A-Sepharose. The immunoprecipitates were
washed three times with lysis buffer and analyzed by
Western blot analysis, which was performed using primary
antibodies against G6PD (Abcam, Cambridge, UK),
BAG3 (Abcam, Cambridge, UK) or GAPDH (Chemicon,
Bedford, MA), horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated
anti-mouse or anti-rabbit secondary antibodies (Amersham
Biosciences, UK) and ECL solutions (Amersham
Biosciences, UK).

In situ Proximity ligation assay (PLA)
In situ proximity ligation assay (PLA) was
performed using Duolink PLA (Sigma-Aldrich, Saint
Louis, MO) according to the manufacturer’s protocol.
PLA probes were diluted in 0.1% Triton X-100/PBS/1%
fetal calf serum and incubated in a pre-heated humidity
chamber for 1 h at 37°C, followed by hybridization,
ligation, amplification, and detection. Fluorescence was
visualized under a confocal microscopy (TCS SP5 Leica
Microsystems).

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Culture of cell lines
HEK293, Bel-7402, HepG2 and SMMC-7721 cell
lines were maintained in DMEM (Sigma-Aldrich, Saint
Louis, MO) and supplemented with 10% fetal bovine
serum (FBS, ExCell Biology Inc., Shanghai, China).

Cell proliferation assay

G6PD enzyme activity

Cells were seeded into 6-well plates at a density of
10,000 cells per well in 2 ml of medium supplemented
with 10% FBS. The medium was changed every 2 days.
Cell number at the indicated time points was determined
by counting using a haemocytometer.

G6PD enzyme activity was determined used G6PD
activity assay kit (Cayman Chemical, MI) according
to the manufacturer’s instructions. G6PDH catalyzes
the oxidation of glucose-6-phosphate to 6-phosphoD-gluconate, along with the concomitant reduction of
NADP+ to NADPH. NADPH reacts with the fluorometric
detector to yield a highly fluorescent product which can be
analyzed with an excitation wavelength of 530 nm and an
emission wavelength of 595 nm. Enzyme activities were
normalized on the basis of protein concentration, which
was determined by a BCA protein assay kit (Pierce).

Growth curve assays using real-time cell
analyzer (RTCA)
To analyze the cells continuously over time,
growth curve assays were performed in real time in
quadruplicate with the xCELLigence system (ACEA
Bioscience, San Diego, CA) as previously described
[19]. Briefly, 5,000 cells per well were seeded in
RTCA E-plates (ACEA Bioscience, San Diego, CA),
the electrical impedance in each well was measured
continuously. The shift of the electrical impedance is
expressed as the cell index, which is a parameter of cell
viability.

Supplement of nucleosides
The current study used combination of uridine and
hypoxathine (Sigma-Aldrich) for nucleosides supplement.
Uridine and hypoxathine are the pyrimidine base for UMP
and purine base for IMP generation, respectively. UMP
and IMP are the firstly fully formed pyrimidine and purine
nucleotide in vivo, from which all nucleotides used for
DNA and RNA synthesis can be produced.

De novo DNA biosynthesis

Statistics

DNA synthesis was determined by Click-iT
Edu Assay Kit (Invitrogen, CA) according to the
manufacturer’s protocol. Briefly, HCCs were incubated
with 10 μM of nucleoside analog 5-ethynyl-2′
deoxyuridine (Edu) in complete medium for 4 hours. After
washing and fixation, incorporated Edu was labeled with
Alexa Fluor 555 azide in the provided reaction buffer for
30 min.

The statistical significance of the difference
was analyzed by ANOVA and post hoc Dunnett’s test.
Statistical significance was defined as P < 0.05. All
experiments were repeated three times, and data were
expressed as the mean ± SD (standard deviation) from a
representative experiment.

Measurement of the PPP flux

This work was partly supported by National Natural
Science Foundation of China (31170727, 81470584,
81302270 and 81572828) and Ministry of Education
(IRT13101).

HCCs were cultured in medium containing [2–13C]
glucose (Sigma-Aldrich), and the PPP flux was measured
on the basis of the rate of glucose consumption and 13C
labeling patterns in lactate (incorporated into carbon
2 and carbon 3 generated by glycolysis and the PPP,
respectively) determined by nuclear magnetic resonance
(NMR) spectroscopy [15].

CONFLICTS OF INTEREST
There is no conflicts of interest that could be
perceived prejudicing the impartiality of the research
reported.

Cellular NADPH measurement
Cellular NADPH concentrations were determined
by a NADPH assay kit (Abcam, Cambridge, UK)
according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Briefly, HCCs
were lysed in 400 ml extraction buffer provided and half of
this lysate were heated at 60°C for 30 min to decompose
NADP+. Under these conditions NADPH remained intact,
according to the manufacturer. A portion of this heatedextract was used to determine NADPH concentration.
Another portion was used in protein concentration
determination for normalization.
