Abstract
Drug-induced gene-expression proﬁles that invert disease proﬁles have recently been illustrated to be a
starting point for drug repositioning. In this study, we validate this approach and focus on prediction of novel
drugs for colorectal cancer, for which there is a pressing need to ﬁnd novel antimetastatic compounds. We
computationally predicted three novel and still unknown compounds against colorectal cancer: citalopram
(an antidepressant), troglitazone (an antidiabetic), and enilconazole (a fungicide). We veriﬁed the compounds by in vitro assays of clonogenic survival, proliferation, and migration and in a subcutaneous mouse
model. We found evidence that the mode of action of these compounds may be through inhibition of TGFb
signaling. Furthermore, one compound, citalopram, reduced tumor size as well as the number of circulating
tumor cells and metastases in an orthotopic mouse model of colorectal cancer. This study proposes
citalopram as a potential therapeutic option for patients with colorectal cancer, illustrating the potential
of systems pharmacology. Cancer Res; 74(20); 5690–9. 2014 AACR.

Introduction
Rational drug discovery has gained momentum by the
recently increased availability of large-scale datasets on biologic activities of small molecules. Integration and utilization
of these heterogeneous resources require computational tools,
as well as expert knowledge to guide the drug discovery or
repositioning process. To enable the latter, a pioneering systems pharmacology study built the Connectivity Map (CMap),
a collection of genome-wide gene-expression readouts of
cell lines treated with more than 1,000 drug-like chemicals
(1). This approach is fundamentally based on the observation

that, in many cases, drugs with similar mechanism of action
in vivo also elicit similar expression responses in this in vitro
model system, thus providing a starting point for drug repositioning based on expression proﬁle similarity (1, 2). Moreover, it was proposed that a drug-induced gene-expression
proﬁle that (partially) inverts a disease-associated expression
proﬁle could hint at a potential treatment for the respective
disease and indeed, by applying this concept, novel compounds
have been recently proposed for inﬂammatory bowel disease,
non–small cell lung cancer, and muscle atrophy (3–6). Thus,
the repositioning of drugs based on speciﬁcally tailored gene
signatures has been demonstrated for these diseases. However,
although an enrichment of drug–disease relations has been
found among anticorrelated proﬁles when all diseases are
considered together, it remains to be investigated how well
this approach works for each individual disease where an
expression proﬁle is available.
A systematic analysis requires addressing various biases
that are inherent to the CMap data, such as batch effects, which
can be partially removed with a normalization procedure (7).
Furthermore, to predict new treatment candidates for a disease,
the disease itself needs to be clearly deﬁned and characterized at
the molecular level. Finally, a robust gene-expression proﬁle,
associated with the disease that is also relevant for the disease
etiology, is necessary to make accurate predictions.
Here, we present a global, unbiased approach for using
drug-induced gene-expression proﬁles to retrieve novel candidate drugs with many cancer proﬁles being inversely
matched. Our analysis shows a particularly strong signal for
colorectal cancer, which is the third most common cancer in
Western countries (8). Patients with colorectal cancer with

New Drug Candidates for Metastatic Colorectal Cancer

nonmetastatic disease have excellent long-term survival as in
most cases localized primary tumors can be surgically
removed. However, survival rates drop signiﬁcantly with the
occurrence of distant metastases. Although hepatic metastases
can be surgically removed in a curative intention, thereby
providing long-term cure in a signiﬁcant number of patients,
metastatic disease often recurs, and patients succumb to
recurrent metastatic disease or primarily unresectable multifocal metastases (9, 10). The fate of patients with colorectal
cancer is therefore closely linked to the occurrence of distant
metastases. Although the clinical signiﬁcance of metastasis in
colorectal cancer is evident, the process of metastasis is still
poorly understood (11). It is widely accepted that circulating
tumor cells play a pivotal role in distant tumor dissemination
and their detection is closely linked to the prognosis of patients
with colorectal cancer (12–16). To actively leave the tumor,
enter the blood stream, attach to the vessel endothelium in the
target organ, invade, proliferate, and form new lesions, abilities
far beyond those of a bulk tumor cells (e.g., migration and
invasion capacities) are essential for metastatic tumor cells. In
that respect, to reduce the risk of (further) tumor cell dissemination in patients with colorectal cancer, especially in the
neoadjuvant situation (e.g., in locally advanced rectal cancer
requiring neoadjuvant treatment or the "liver ﬁrst" approach in
synchronously metastasized colorectal cancer; ref. 17), there is
a huge clinical need for (novel) antimetastatic drugs.
We illustrate the power of our approach by experimentally
validating three predicted novel drugs that could be repositioned for colorectal cancer. We speciﬁcally test the three
predicted drugs for their potential to inhibit metastasis. We
conﬁrm in vitro that these drugs inhibit cell migration. Second,
we validate that they inhibit tumor growth in vivo in a subcutaneous mouse model. Finally, using an orthotopic mouse
model of colorectal cancer, we conﬁrm the antimetastatic
properties of citalopram in vivo. Taken together, from a broad
and comprehensive bioinformatics approach, via various
computational and experimental ﬁltering and validation procedures, we arrived at a very speciﬁc, clinical relevant indication in the context of colorectal cancer and propose that the
antidepressant drug citalopram can serve at least as a lead for
treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer.

Materials and Methods
CMap data
The CMap (build 02) is a large-scale microarray resource
cataloguing transcriptomic responses of four human cell
lines (promyelocytic leukemia HL60, breast adenocarcinoma
MCF7, prostate cancer PC3, and skin melanoma SKMEL5
cell lines) to various small-molecule treatments (referred
to as drugs for simplicity). It contains 6,100 treatment
instances for 1,309 unique drugs, of which approximately
650 are FDA approved (1, 18). To eliminate various biases in
CMap (e.g., batch effect, microarray platforms), we ﬁltered
and normalized the raw CMap dataset (downloaded from
http://www.broadinstitute.org/cmap/) as described in detail
previously (7). For this study, we retrieved 4,849 druginduced gene-expression proﬁles from three main cell lines

www.aacrjournals.org

(HL60, MCF7, and PC3) representing 1,144 distinct drugs (for
a detailed list, refer to Supplementary Table S3).
Disease-associated microarrays
Microarray experiments on speciﬁc diseases were identiﬁed
in the public microarray repository of NCBI Gene Expression
Omnibus (GEO; http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/; ref. 19)
using disease medical subject heading (MeSH) terms that were
attributed to each study (20–22). In this study, we restricted
our analysis to disease MeSH terms that are associated with
at least one CMap drug. Moreover, we only analyzed raw
datasets conducted on HG-U133A and HG-U133-Plus2 microarray platforms to maximize comparability across resources.
Next, all individual samples were manually annotated as
"disease" or "healthy controls." To obtain reliable disease signatures, microarray samples (disease vs. healthy) were
retained only if derived from disease-relevant primary tissues.
The RMA procedure was employed to normalize each dataset
separately (23). In cases, where multiple studies were found for
the same disease, we selected one representative per disease,
such that distinction between disease and healthy samples is
maximized on the basis of interarray Pearson correlation
(highest AUC in receiver operating characteristic analysis),
and discarded the others. Finally, in each disease-related geneexpression proﬁle, only probe sets present in HT_HG-U133A
(HT Human Genome U133 Array Plate Set, 22277 probe sets)
were kept and ranked according to their fold change. In total,
we obtained here a total of 40 disease-associated gene-expression proﬁles from 1,748 individual microarray samples (for
details refer to Supplementary Table S1).
Similarity score of drugs and diseases
To calculate proﬁle similarity of a drug with a disease, we
adapted a proﬁle comparison method initially developed for
drug–drug comparisons (7). First, a disease-related signature
was deﬁned from the top and bottom 250 ranked probe sets of
drug-associated gene-expression proﬁles. We then computed
disease–drug similarity by querying the up- and downregulated signatures of the disease within drug-induced geneexpression proﬁles (HT_HG-U133A, 22277 probe sets without
Present/Absent call ﬁltering) using gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA, weighted; ref. 24). At last, two enrichments scores
for up/down disease signatures were averaged to derive a ﬁnal
score for disease–drug similarity. We assessed whether known
drug–disease associations (indications, excluding "antidotes"
from http://www.drugs.com/medical_conditions.html updated October 7, 2013) are signiﬁcantly anticorrelated using a
nonparametric Wilcoxon signed rank test. To this end, similarity scores from each cell line were ranked in the range of
(0–1) and pooled together. For each disease, we compared the
similarity scores of known drug associations to all other drugs
present in CMap (Supplementary Fig. S1 and Supplementary
Table S2). Signiﬁcantly, anticorrelated diseases were deﬁned
as P < 0.05 after FDR correction for multiple testing.
Metastatic colon cancer gene signature
To identify novel therapeutics against metastatic colorectal
cancer, we utilized a consensus gene signature deﬁned by

Jorissen and colleagues (25). From two independent sets of
colorectal cancers, a metastatic signature was derived that
showed consistent expression changes between early-stage
(A) and metastatic stage (D) tumors. In total, there were
86 stage A tumors, 91 stage D primary tumors, and 30 stage
D metastases. The signature was derived from consistent
changes between three comparisons: (i) early-stage (A; n ¼
44) and metastatic stage (D; n ¼ 61) primary tumors from the
ﬁrst independent set; (ii) early-stage (A; n ¼ 42) and metastatic
stage (D; n ¼ 32) primary tumors from the second set; and
(iii) early-stage (A; n ¼ 42) primary tumors and metastatic
stage (D; n ¼ 30) metastases from the second set. The signature
consists of 163 probe sets representing in total 127 unique
genes (73 up- and 54 downregulated; Supplementary Table S3).
Probe sets not present in the CMap dataset (HT_HG-U133A
platform) were removed from the signature. After ﬁltering, the
metastasis signature was compared against the CMap reference collection that contains 4,849 gene-expression proﬁles
from three cell lines treated with 1,144 distinct drugs. We used
the scoring approach described above to quantify proﬁle
similarity between drugs and the metastasis signature. For
each drug, a ﬁnal score was obtained by averaging the enrichment scores across all replicates from three cell lines (Supplementary Table S4). We further examined the top 20 drugs
with lowest scores (anticorrelated) and manually searched in
the literature whether these drugs were previously associated
with colon cancer or metastasis.
Cell lines and reagents
The colorectal cancer cell lines, HCT 116 and HT-29, were
obtained from ATCC and maintained in DMEM (PAA) þ 10%
FCS (PAA), 100 U/mL penicillin (PAA), and 100 mg/mL streptomycin (PAA) in a humidiﬁed atmosphere of 5% CO2 at 37 C.
The cell lines were tested for authenticity by DSMZ on a regular
basis. Enilconazole (Imazalil) and troglitazone were obtained
from Sigma-Aldrich and Neochema, citalopram was obtained
from Lundbeck.
MTT proliferation assay
The WST-1 reagent (Roche) is reduced by metabolically
active cells to formazan, an insoluble purple dye that can be
measured in a spectrophotometer, and was used according to
the manufacturer's instructions. Cells were seeded in quadruplicates in increasing cell numbers in 96-well plates (125, 250,
500, 1,000 per well). After 12-hour adhesion time, the cells were
treated with the compounds as indicated. One hundred and
twenty hours later, 10 mL of WST-1 reagent were added to each
well and the cells were again incubated for 4 hours at 37 C and
5% CO2. After incubation and 1 minute shaking, the absorbance
was measured on a Genios Microplate Reader (Tecan).
Clonogenic survival assay
Clonogenic survival assay was done as previously described
(26, 27). In brief, tumor cells were plated in triplicates to yield
50 to 100 colonies per culture ﬂask, treated with the compounds in various concentrations, and incubated for 14 to
21 days. Colonies of more than 50 cells, as assessed by microscopic inspection, were scored as survivors and counted.

Migration assay
The migration of tumor cells under treatment was measured via Transwell assays as described previously (26, 27).
Brieﬂy, cells were incubated with the compounds in various
concentrations for 2 hours. Then 200 mL of cell suspension
(3  105 cells/mL) were added in triplicate Transwells
(Matrigel-coated Transwell inserts; 8 mmol/L pore size;
Becton Dickinson). After 18 hours of incubation, migratory
tumor cells had invaded the underside of the membrane,
were ﬁxed, stained in thiazine and eosin solution, and
sealed on slides. Quantiﬁcation was done by microscopic
counting.
TGFb signaling assay
To demonstrate the effects of the three compounds on the
TGFb signaling pathway, we used a cell line stably expressing a
secreted alkaline phosphatase reporter inducible by SMAD3/4inducible elements (SBE), called HEK-Blue TGFb sensor cell
line (Invivogen). This way, downstream activation of the TGFb
signaling pathway can be measured spectrophotometrically in
the cell culture supernatants. The effects of the three compounds on TGFb signaling pathway were analyzed using the
HEK-Blue TGFb Kit (Invivogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions.
Animal experiments
All animal experiments strictly adhered to local and federal
regulations as well as FELASA guidelines, and were approved
by the local authorities before initiation.
For the subcutaneous experiments, 107 tumor cells in 100 mL
of PBS were injected bilaterally into the ﬂanks of NOD.CgPrkdcscid Il2rgtm1Wjl/SzJ (NSG) mice. When tumors reached a
size of 10 to 12 mm in largest diameter, the mice were
euthanized, the tumors excised, and cut into tumor fragments
of 1  1 mm size. The tumor fragments were implanted
subcutaneously into recipient NSG mice and monitored thrice
weekly for tumor growth. Once tumors were established,
growing, and had a size of 7 to 8 mm in largest diameter, the
treatment was initiated.
For orthotopic tumor cell injection, the mice were anesthetized by isoﬂurane inhalation. A midline laparotomy was
performed and the cecum was exteriorized and 105 HCT
116 tumor cells in 20 mL Matrigel (BD) were injected subserosally by help of a microinjection pump (WPI) under microscopic visual control. After injection, the abdomen was closed
with PDS II 6-0 (J&J Ethicon) and wound clips.
The treatment regimens were as follows:
Citalopram: 60 mg/kg body weight (BW) i.p. daily, dissolved in
100 mL NaCl 0.9% in the subcutaneous experiment. Because
of low tolerability (signiﬁcant weight loss due to loss of
appetite), the dose was reduced to 20 mg/kg i.p. daily for the
orthotopic experiment.
Enilconazole: 20 mg/kg BW i.p. daily, dissolved in 20 mL
DMSO
Troglitazone: 30 mg/kg BW i.p. every third day, dissolved in
100 mL 9% Solutol HS 15

New Drug Candidates for Metastatic Colorectal Cancer

Quantiﬁcation of circulating tumor cells
Thirty-ﬁve days after orthotopic tumor cell injection, the
mice in the control group were moribund and the experiment
was terminated. The mice were anesthesized by isoﬂurane
inhalation, blood samples were taken via intracardiac puncture, and the mice were euthanized. The blood was layered over
LSM 1077 lymphocyte gradient medium (PAA) and the peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) fraction was enriched
according to the manufacturer's instructions. The resulting
PBMCs were stained with Alexa-Fluor488-anti-human EpCAM
antibody (Biolegend), EpCAM-positive cells were identiﬁed
and counted under a ﬂuorescence microscope (Leica). The
number of circulating tumor cells (CTC) per mL of blood was
calculated according to the total blood volume obtained by
cardiac puncture.
Histologic work-up
Upon euthanasia, the livers and lungs of the animals were
removed and immediately ﬁxed in 4% paraformaldehyde.
After parafﬁn embedding, the FFPE tissue was cut in 10 mm
(liver) or 2 mm (lung) sections using a Leica microtome.
Lungs were cut in a representative layer in the coronal plane;
livers were cut in three representative layers (cranial third,
middle third, and caudal third) in the transversal plane to be
able to detect the majority of metastatic lesions. The tissue
sections were stained with a standard hematoxylin and eosin
protocol and metastases were counted.
Statistical analysis
Datasets were screened for outliers with the ROUT method
(Q ¼ 10%; ref. 28), a total of four statistically signiﬁcant outliers
were identiﬁed (all in the orthotopic citalopram experiment:
1 among the tumor weight values, 2 among the tumor volume
values, 1 among the CTC number values). The ﬁndings were
checked for biologic validity and the values were excluded
when the cause of the deviation was considered artiﬁcial (e.g.,
faulty measurements). Three out of 4 outliers were found to be
biologically invalid values and excluded from further analysis;
the outlier among the CTC values was considered biologically
possible and was therefore not excluded. Student t test was
used to compare means. In case of time series, only the last
time-point was tested. All analyses were two tailed, and P < 0.05
was considered statistically signiﬁcant ( , P < 0.05;  , P < 0.01;

, P < 0.001).
Propidium iodide/Annexin V apoptosis assay
A total of 5  104 (HT-29) or 3  104 (HCT116) colorectal
cancer cells per well were seeded in 24-well plates, allowed to
adhere for 12 hours, and then treated with the compounds,
negative or positive controls as indicated. Seventy-two hours
after incubation, the cells were harvested with trypsin and
washed twice with FACS-binding buffer (10 mmol/L Hepes, pH
7.4, 2.5 mmol/L CaCl2, 140 mmol/L NaCl). Then the cells were
stained with propidium iodide (PI) and Annexin V–FITC
(Becton Dickinson) and 10,000 cells were analyzed and quantiﬁed by ﬂow cytometry on a FACS Calibur (Becton Dickinson).
Annexin-positive cells were considered apoptotic and the ratio
of apoptotic cells/total cells was calculated.

Results
Reverse proﬁle searches for retrieval of drug–disease
associations
To evaluate the general validity of the inverse signature
approach, we assessed how well the known disease–drug
indications were recapitulated by the expression-based
inverse correlation of disease–drug relations for individual
diseases. To this end, we ﬁrst normalized the CMap dataset
to obtain 4,849 drug-induced gene-expression proﬁles from
three main cell lines (HL60, MCF7, and PC3) treated with
1,144 distinct drugs (7). In addition, we extracted diseaseassociated microarray experiments from publicly available
NCBI GEO microarray repository using MeSH descriptors
(19). For this analysis, we next generated disease-associated
gene-expression proﬁles for 40 distinct diseases (details in
Materials and Methods).
Indeed, in the normalized CMap data, signiﬁcant anticorrelations were found between drug and disease gene-expression proﬁles for known drug–disease associations for seven out
of 40 diseases (Supplementary Fig. S1). Anticorrelations were
most successful in the retrieval of disease–drug relations
involving anticancer agents that were additionally linked to
multiple cancers (six out of seven signiﬁcant diseases), including colorectal cancer (Supplementary Fig. S1). On the basis of
this result, we focused on colorectal cancer to predict novel
drug compounds aiming speciﬁcally at an inhibition of metastasis as the latter is of considerable clinical relevance.
Prediction of novel drug compounds for metastatic
colorectal cancer
As colorectal cancer scored very prominently among the
general disease–drug relations and because there are insufﬁcient treatment options, particularly for inhibiting metastasis,
we chose to illustrate the power of the inverse-signature
method by predicting and validating drugs used in other
indications as candidates for colorectal cancer treatment.
Several gene-expression signatures for colorectal cancer are
available, but the most pressing need is for drugs that inhibit
metastasis, which could also be used as an adjuvant therapy. As
opposed to previous studies that have used healthy versus
diseased states (29), we rather chose to compare nonmetastatic tumors versus metastatic primary tumors and metastases, to deﬁne a gene signature of metastatic potential rather
than a general cancer signature. Several groups have studied
the gene-expression differences between primary and metastatic colon cancers to explain the molecular basis of the
metastatic process and predict clinical outcomes (25, 30–
32). In this study, we decided to employ the reproducible
gene-expression signature from (25) that emerged as a consensus from two independent comparisons of Dukes' stage D
versus stage A colorectal cancers (Supplementary Table S3; for
details see Materials and Methods). This signature is based on
primary and metastatic tumors from patients in different
stages of colorectal cancer and includes genes that have been
implicated in the development of metastasis before. We predict novel antimetastatic drugs by ﬁnding anticorrelated druginduced gene-expression proﬁles, that is, we are looking
for genes that are upregulated in the metastasis proﬁle, but

metastatic disease signature was

search for reverse signatures in the

Enrichment Analysis. The resulting
candidate drugs do not necessarily

downregulated in the druginduced expression proﬁle.
Therefore, an extra reﬁnement step

refs. 33–35). Upon drug treatment by any of these three drugs
(Fig. 2), ﬁbronectin 1, collagen type V, notch homolog 3,
platelet-derived growth factor C, versican, integrin-b5, and
secreted phosphoprotein 1 are downregulated. Four of the

The validity of the procedure is illustrated by the fact that

verteporﬁn (33), resveratrol (34), and novobiocin (35), all

action (37, 39) and inhibits pulmonary metastasis of osteosarcoma (38). Second, citalopram, an antidepressant drug of the
selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor class is approved to be
used in humans but not an obvious candidate for screening
against metastatic colorectal cancer. The third candidate
enilconazole is a fungicide that has only been approved for
topical use in veterinary medicine. Hence, the three candidates
to be validated experimentally for their efﬁcacy against metastatic colorectal cancer are not only chemically diverse, but
also come with different levels of expectation.

Mode of action
To better understand the underlying basis of our predictions, we set out to ﬁnd the main mode of action of the three
selected compounds. There are various signaling pathways
that could play a role. One of them, TGFb exerts its effects on
cell proliferation, differentiation, and migration in part
through its modulation of extracellular matrix components,
such as ﬁbronectin and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1
(40), which we ﬁnd downregulated by the candidate drugs. It
has recently been shown that resveratrol inhibits the TGFb1induced increase in cell adhesion, migration, and invasion

receptor integrin-b5 together are vital for cell migration (36).
This conﬁrms the metastatic colorectal cancer gene signature
to be appropriate for our purpose. The candidate drugs found
by inverse proﬁle search do not fully overlap in the set of genes
whose expression is inverted relative to the disease proﬁle.
Thus, to ﬁnd the most relevant drug candidates, we reﬁned our
list of top 20 candidate compounds by hierarchical clustering
of the drug-induced gene-expression data from individual
experiments in different cell lines and batches (Fig. 1) and
continue with those that cluster together (Fig. 2). The clustering shows that some marketed drugs such as enilconazole
(antifungal), citalopram (antidepressant), and troglitazone
(antidiabetic) induce regulatory responses similar to verteporﬁn and resveratrol (Fig. 2).
The best scoring candidate drugs, namely enilconazole,
citalopram, and troglitazone, were selected for further experimental validations. Among these, only troglitazone (an antidiabetic and anti-inﬂammatory drug) has been previously
associated with decreased migratory behavior of various cell
types (37–39) but not with colorectal cancer. For example,
troglitazone has been screened in breast cancer metastasis. It
has been reported that troglitazone reduces the migration,
adhesion, and spreading of human breast cancer cells on

shown to have antimigratory properties in glioma cells, associated with transcriptional repression of TGFb (1–3) and their
receptors I and II and with reduced TGFb release (42) and to
inhibit the TGFb-induced epithelial–mesenchymal transition
of primary alveolar epithelial cells (43). On the basis of similarity in downregulated genes (Fig. 2), in particular the strong
inhibition of the ﬁbronectin 1 gene and integrin-b5, our
expectation is that our other candidate drugs would also exert
their antimigratory effect through inhibition of TGFb signaling. To demonstrate the effects of the three compounds on

Experimental validation of citalopram, troglitazone, and
enilconazole against metastatic colorectal cancer
We veriﬁed the predictions by in vitro tests showing that
the three compounds troglitazone, citalopram, and enilconazole signiﬁcantly inhibited cell migration and clonogenic
survival of HCT 116 and HT-29 human colorectal cancer
cells, both important hallmarks of metastasis (Fig. 4).
Although we were speciﬁcally searching for antimetastatic
compounds, we additionally sought to avoid growth stimulatory effects on primary tumors. For this purpose, the
three compounds were tested for effects on proliferation.
They did in fact inhibit this process albeit to a different
extent (Fig. 4).
On the basis of the promising results of the in vitro assays,
next we tested the three compounds in a subcutaneous tumor
model in mice (Fig. 5A; ref. 44). We anticipated inhibition of
tumor growth as all three compounds had demonstrated
antiproliferative effects. Immunodeﬁcient mice (NOD scid-g)
were subcutaneously implanted with tumor fragments and
monitored for tumor growth. All three compounds signiﬁcantly inhibited the growth of subcutaneous tumors, but enilconazole and citalopram showed the most profound effects
(Fig. 5A). Of these two, citalopram was tolerated best by the
mice and was investigated further. PI/Annexin-based FACS

the TGFb signaling pathway, we utilized a cell line stably
expressing a reporter of TGFb signaling (see Materials and
Methods). The three compounds demonstrated signiﬁcant
inhibition of TGFb signaling and are likely to inhibit cell
migration and invasion with the same mode of action as
resveratrol (Fig. 3), thus strengthening our predictions based
on a global computational screen.

assays evaluating the fraction of apoptotic cells conﬁrmed that
the compounds were indeed inhibiting metastasis and not
generally cytotoxic on tumors (Supplementary Fig. S3).
As subcutaneous tumor models primarily simulate growth
of the primary tumor and can reproduce the metastatic
cascade only to a limited extent, we next investigated citalopram in an orthotopic mouse model of colorectal cancer,
which is able to reproduce the metastatic cascade and mimic
the clinical course of colorectal cancer (44). We established an
orthotopic model of colorectal cancer by surgical implantation

of a tumor in the cecal wall (see Materials and Methods). Mice
were treated with citalopram or vehicle. After 35 days, all mice
in the control group were moribund due to extensive tumor
burden, whereas the mice in the treatment group were in
signiﬁcantly better condition. The mice were sacriﬁced and
tumor volume and tumor weight were measured, which were
both signiﬁcantly reduced in the citalopram group as compared with the controls (Fig. 5B). As a direct correlate of the
metastatic activity of a tumor, we also quantiﬁed the CTC in
the blood of the animals (Supplementary Fig. S4). CTC

numbers were signiﬁcantly reduced in the citalopram-treated
mice, indicating a reduced metastatic activity of the tumors
after citalopram treatment. Finally, the number of metastases
in the livers and lungs were quantiﬁed and revealed a significantly reduced number of metastatic deposits in the livers of
the animals (Fig. 5C; P < 0.01). The number of metastatic
nodules in the lungs was also reduced by citalopram treatment,
however, failed to reach statistical signiﬁcance (P ¼ 0.27).
These results show that citalopram can inhibit both tumor
growth as well as metastasis of colorectal cancer.

Discussion
Using a system pharmacology approach based on the integration of publicly available drug-induced gene-expression
data, we inferred that the antidiabetic drug troglitazone, the
antifungal drug enilconazole, and the antidepressant citalopram could potentially lead to novel therapeutics for the
prevention of metastasis in colorectal cancer, thereby reducing
the leading cause of death in patients with colorectal cancer.
On the basis of the known mode of action of the top correlated
drugs and functional analysis of inhibited genes, we propose
that the main mode of action of these compounds is via the
inhibition of TGFb signaling. We performed experimental
validations for the anticancer activities of all three compounds
using in vitro and subcutaneous tumor models in mice and we
showed the efﬁcacy of citalopram in an orthotopic mouse
model of colorectal cancer, which is the clinically most relevant
model to examine the effects of a compound on the process of
metastasis.
In an orthotopic model, we demonstrated that citalopram
had effects on both CTC numbers, the gold-standard surrogate
marker for metastatic activity (45) as well as on the number of
hepatic metastases, which is the clinically apparent outcome of
a tumor's metastatic activity.
Because of low tolerability in the subcutaneous model, we
could not test enilconazole and troglitazone in the orthotopic
colorectal cancer model. Still, the in vitro experiments show the
desired effect so that they represent promising leads to arrive
at similar compounds, which are tolerated better and can be
tested against metastatic colorectal cancer in the future.
Although the number of hepatic metastases was signiﬁcantly reduced in the citalopram-treated orthotopic colorectal
cancer mice, the number of pulmonary foci was reduced as
well, although this effect failed to reach statistical signiﬁcance.
This can most likely be explained by the ﬁlter effect of the
hepatic capillary bed. As previously shown, the number of
circulating tumor cells is signiﬁcantly reduced in the blood
after having passed the liver (i.e., the hepatic veins) as compared with before passing the liver (i.e., in the portal vein;

ref. 46). This ﬁlter effect may have weakened the impact of the
treatment on pulmonary metastasis.
The heterogeneity of cancers and especially colorectal cancer makes us hypothesize that even better novel therapies
could be developed through systems pharmacology. There are
many different subtypes, both genetically, such as microsatellite-stable versus unstable or BRAF-driven versus KRASdriven and histologically, such as serrated versus classical
colorectal cancer (47). In the future, the subclassiﬁcation and
molecular characterization of these colorectal cancer subtypes
into more speciﬁc diseases as well as the development of
corresponding murine disease models that mimic the speciﬁc
disease subtypes will allow for the discovery of better targeted,
stratiﬁed therapies.
We conclude that our implementation of the reverse geneexpression proﬁling concept shows very promising results for
the retrieval of novel candidate drugs; in particular, for the
treatment of cancer-like disease as we have shown in our
general analysis. Indeed, CMap employs cancer cell lines to
establish drug-induced gene-expression proﬁles where many
genes involved in cancer-relevant pathways are expressed.
In the LINCS consortium, more data are being generated
for various types of human primary cells and cell lines that
will even improve the power of this approach (http://www.
lincsproject.org). More relevant cell line or tissue models will
make this approach more broadly applicable to other types of
diseases in addition to cancer.
