ABSTRACT
Long-term survival in patients with metastatic, relapsed, or recurrent Ewing
sarcoma and rhabdomyosarcoma is dismal. Irinotecan, a topoisomerase 1 inhibitor,
has activity in these sarcomas, but due to poor bioavailability of its active metabolite
(SN-38) has had limited clinical efficacy. In this study we have evaluated the efficacy
and toxicity of STA-8666, a novel drug conjugate which uses an HSP90 inhibitor
to facilitate intracellular, tumor-targeted delivery of the topoisomerase 1 inhibitor
SN-38, thus preferentially delivering and concentrating SN-38 within tumor tissue.
We present in vivo evidence from mouse xenograft models that STA-8666 results
in more persistent inhibition of topoisomerase 1 and prolonged DNA damage
compared to irinotecan. This translates into superior antitumor efficacy and survival
in multiple aggressive models of both diseases in mouse xenografts, as well as in
an irinotecan-resistant model of pediatric osteosarcoma, demonstrated by dramatic
tumor shrinkage, durable remission and prolonged complete regressions following
short-term treatment, compared to conventional irinotecan. Gene expression analysis
performed on xenograft tumors treated with either irinotecan or STA-8666 showed
that STA-8666 affected expression of DNA damage and repair genes more robustly
than irinotecan. These results suggest that STA-8666 may be a promising new agent
for patients with pediatric-type sarcoma.

INTRODUCTION

Irinotecan, an analog of camptothecin, is an
antineoplastic agent that acts to inhibit topoisomerase
1, resulting in impaired relaxation of supercoiled DNA
during DNA replication [5]. It is commonly used as part
of a chemotherapeutic regimen to treat adult patients with
colorectal cancer, pancreatic cancer, small cell lung cancer
and gastric cancer [6–9]. Likewise, irinotecan has shown
promising activity in pediatric patients with relapsed
and refractory sarcomas. Response rates of 11–86% for
rhabdomyosarcoma [10–12] and 38% in Ewing/PNET
[11] have been reported in heavily pretreated patients who
received single-agent irinotecan on a variety of dosing
schedules. When used in combination with other agents in

Rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) is the most common
soft tissue sarcoma of childhood and Ewing sarcoma
(ES) is the second most common malignant bone tumor
of childhood [1, 2]. Outcomes in patients with these
tumors who present with localized disease have improved
over the past several decades, largely due to advances in
multimodal therapy and supportive care [3]. However
long-term outcomes in patients with metastatic, relapsed,
or recurrent ES and RMS are dismal, with survival rates
less than 20% [4]. Hence, new therapies for these diseases
are critically needed.

early phase studies of relapsed Ewing sarcoma, response
rates approached 60–70% in some studies [13]. Of note,
studies in xenograft models of human tumors have shown
that the activity of irinotecan is schedule-dependent,
with protracted schedules producing superior responses
[14]. Based on such data, protracted dosing schedules
are typically used in pediatrics to maximize irinotecan
exposure and efficacy [11, 15–17].
Despite the promising results seen in the clinical
setting, there are a number of factors that negatively
impact the efficacy of irinotecan, limiting its therapeutic
potential. Irinotecan is a prodrug of SN-38 [18].
Compared to irinotecan, SN-38 has between a 100 and
1000-fold greater antitumor activity in vitro, but cannot
be administered directly to patients due to difficulties with
solubility and toxicity [19, 20]. Specifically, SN-38 is
unstable at physiological pH [20]. In order to be converted
to SN-38, irinotecan requires de-esterification, primarily in
the liver [18]. Unfortunately, this process is inefficient and
only a small amount is converted to the active metabolite
[20, 21]. In addition, there is wide interpatient variability
in efficiency of conversion to the active metabolite
[20, 22]. Furthermore, irinotecan is also converted into a
number of less active forms, including SN-38G, which is
excreted in the bile and urine [21]. Due to the complex
metabolism of irinotecan, drug bioavailability is not
optimal in human patients.
Heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) is a molecular
chaperone that regulates the post-translational folding,
stability, and function of many client proteins. A number
of these client proteins play critical roles in cancer cells,
where HSP90 is widely expressed [23]. For this reason,
HSP90 inhibitors have become an exciting target in
cancer research. In vivo, it has been observed that HSP90
inhibitors negatively affect the growth of tumor cells,
while minimally affecting normal tissues [24]. In fact,
HSP90 inhibitors display very favorable pharmacokinetics
for anticancer use, as they concentrate in tumor tissues for
a prolonged period of time and at higher levels, compared
to normal tissues [25–27]. Although the mechanism for
this effect is not completely understood, it is characteristic
of a number of chemically distinct clinically evaluated
agents. Various theories for the tumor selectivity of
HSP90 inhibitors include HSP90 overexpression, unique
posttranslational modification, and high expression of
Mps1 in tumor cells [28, 29]. Whatever its basis, this
unique property makes HSP90 inhibitors ideal intracellular
delivery vehicles for chemotherapeutic drugs, allowing for
high tumor exposure and low systemic toxicity. STA-8666
(Synta Pharmaceuticals, Lexington, MA) is an HSP90
inhibitor drug conjugate (HDC), which consists of an
HSP90 inhibitor (STA-8663) attached to SN-38 through
a cleavable chemical linker. This agent has recently been
shown to demonstrate prolonged tumor exposure to SN-38
when compared to irinotecan in several xenograft models
[30, 31]. The purpose of this study was to test the efficacy
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

of this HDC in xenograft models of irinotecan-responsive
pediatric-type sarcomas, and to explore its mechanism of
action in these tumor types.

RESULTS
The HSP90 inhibitor component of STA-8666 is
less potent in vitro than the closely related HSP90
inhibitor in clinical use (ganetespib)
Published literature suggests that the HSP90
inhibitor component of STA-8666 functions primarily as
a delivery vehicle [30, 31]. To investigate this presumptive
mechanism of action in our pediatric-type sarcoma
models, in vitro experiments were conducted comparing
the activity of the HSP90 inhibitor fragment of STA-8666
(denoted STA-8663) to that of ganetespib (STA-9090), an
HSP90 inhibitor currently undergoing clinical evaluation
that has potent in vitro activity in pediatric sarcoma
cell lines including TC32 (a Ewing sarcoma cell line)
and RH30 (a translocation positive rhabdomyosarcoma
cell line) (Supplementary Figure S1A and S1B). When
assessed for effects on cell proliferation, STA-8663 was
approximately 20-fold less potent than ganetespib in TC32
cells, and approximately 50-fold less potent in RH30 cells,
suggesting that HSP90 inhibition per se likely plays a
limited role in the anti-tumor activity of STA-8666.
Further analysis of the proposed mechanism was
performed by assessing HSP70 induction, an accepted
consequence and pharmacodynamic marker of robust
HSP90 inhibition [32], in ES and RMS cells treated with
ganetespib or STA-8663 (Supplementary Figure S2). In
both TC32 and RH30 cells, induction of HSP70 occurred
at ganetespib concentrations 100-fold lower than those
of STA-8663, consistent with the cell proliferation
data above and supporting a model in which HSP90
modulation by the HSP90 targeting component of
STA-8666 is significantly less than that of ganetespib.

STA-8666 results in complete regression of
palpable ES and RMS tumors in SCID mice
An initial xenograft pilot experiment was conducted
to compare the antitumor activity of STA-8666 to that
of vehicle and an HSP90 inhibitor. STA-8663 was not
available in quantities needed for xenograft experiments.
Thus, we selected ganetespib for comparison. Based on
the data described above, ganetespib is > 10-fold more
potent than STA-8663, and would thus be expected to
out-perform STA-8663 in vivo if HSP90 inhibition were
a key contributor to efficacy in this setting. Treatment
began 10 days after injection of cells, when tumors were
palpable. Due to differences in growth rate of each tumor
type, ES tumors were between 100 and 500 mm3 at the
start of treatment and RMS tumors were between 50 and
90 mm3 at the start of treatment. Of note, both cell lines

were derived from patients who were irinotecan-naïve.
Irinotecan was administered by the IP route, which has
been shown to be more efficacious and less toxic than
the PO and IV routes, respectively [21, 33]. Ganetespib
and STA-8666 were administered by the IV route,
following the recommendation of the manufacturer (Synta
Pharmaceuticals). STA-8666 at a dose of 150 mg/kg
(an equimolar dose of 75 mg/kg STA-8663), which is the
maximally tolerated dose (MTD) for this agent in this
strain of mouse, produced superior antitumor efficacy
compared with vehicle and ganetespib. All mice in the
STA-8666 group exhibited complete tumor regression
after two doses, persisting for 78 days in all RMS mice
and for 137 days in all ES mice. Following the same
schedule, ganetespib at 50 mg/kg showed no antitumor
activity in either xenograft model (Figure 1A and 1B).
Unadjusted p-values were ≤ 0.0002 for comparisons made
between tumor volumes of mice in the STA-8666 group
and ganetespib group for days 15 to 43 in the RMS cohort,
and ≤ 0.0012 for days 15 to 22 in the ES cohort.

ganetespib and STA-8666 and 50 mg/kg for irinotecan).
In addition, STA-8666 was tested at two lower doses:
100 mg/kg, which is the equimolar dose of 50 mg/kg
irinotecan and 50 mg/kg, which is half of the equimolar
dose of irinotecan. The number of doses for each tumor
type was determined by the response of the irinotecan arm;
once the mice in the irinotecan arm no longer had palpable
tumor, the dosing for all groups was discontinued. In both
the irinotecan and STA-8666 arms, complete regressions
were achieved in ES (after two doses) and RMS (after four
doses). However, mice treated with STA-8666 at any dose
had longer and more persistent remissions, compared to
the irinotecan group (Figure 2A and 2B). Mice receiving
irinotecan relapsed first (at day 61 in RMS and at day 29
in ES), while relapse in the lowest-dose (50 mg/kg)
STA-8666 group was delayed (to day 68 in RMS and
day 61 in ES). In RMS mice, a dose response effect was
seen for STA-8666 with longest remissions noted in the
150 mg/kg group, followed by the 100 mg/kg group
and then the 50 mg/kg group. In ES mice, 7/8 mice in
both the 100 mg/kg and the 150 mg/kg groups had no
tumor recurrence at 166 days. In the RMS experiment,
unadjusted p-values were ≤ 0.007 for comparisons made
between tumor volumes of mice in the irinotecan group
and STA-8666 50 mg/kg group, ≤ 0.0002 for comparisons
between the irinotecan group and the STA-8666 100 mg/kg
group, and ≤ 0.0003 for comparisons between the
irinotecan group and the STA-8666 150 mg/kg group for
days 64 through 85. In the ES experiment, unadjusted
p-values comparing tumor volumes of mice receiving
irinotecan to those receiving STA-8666 were ≤ 0.0002 for
all three dose comparisons between days 36 and 54. Highdose ganetespib (150 mg/kg) did not show significant
antitumor activity in either group. Similar to the tumor
growth rate, overall survival was significantly superior for
the mice in the STA-8666 groups (in RMS, p = 0.0004
for irinotecan v. 50 mg/kg STA-8666, and p < 0.0001 for
irinotecan v. STA-8666 at either 100 mg/kg or 150 mg/kg;

STA-8666 results in longer, dose-dependent
remissions of large tumors and superior survival
compared to irinotecan
Given the prolonged complete regressions of
palpable tumors with STA-8666, we next determined
whether postponing primary treatment until tumors
were 1000 mm3 in ES and RMS xenografts would yield
similar responses and whether a dose response would
be observed. Additionally, a direct comparison of STA8666 activity to high dose irinotecan and high dose
ganetespib in both ES and RMS was undertaken. Tumors
of both types were allowed to grow to between 800 and
1000 mm3 before treatment was begun. Mice were dosed
weekly with vehicle, ganetespib, irinotecan, or STA-8666
at one of three doses. Dose selection was based upon the
MTD for each agent in SCID-beige mice (150 mg/kg for

three doses) with a dose response effect in both RMS

at day 62 with 7/8 mice experiencing recurrence by day
181. In the STA-8666 group, all mice remained tumorfree at day 195. Unadjusted p-values were ≤ 0.0379 for
comparisons made between tumor volumes of mice in the
irinotecan group and STA-8666 group for day 107 and
beyond. Overall survival was significantly superior for
the mice receiving STA-8666 (p = 0.0023) (Figure 3B).

STA-8666 is superior to protracted irinotecan in
an additional ES model
Understanding that a single weekly dose of
irinotecan has less activity than protracted dosing in in vivo
models [14], we next compared STA-8666 efficacy to
protracted five day per week dosing of irinotecan to see if
more frequent dosing of the topoisomerase inhibitor would
minimize the difference in response between irinotecan
and weekly STA-8666. In this experiment, EW8 (derived
from an irinotecan-naïve patient) ES tumors were allowed
to grow to an average of 600–800 mm3 before we began
treatment with either vehicle, protracted dose irinotecan at
10 mg/kg daily, five days per week, or weekly STA-8666
at 150 mg/kg. MTD was again used to determine doses,
and mice were dosed for two weeks.
As in the prior experiment, mice receiving both
irinotecan and STA-8666 experienced rapid complete
remissions within 10 days of beginning treatment
(Figure 3A). Mice in the irinotecan group began relapsing

STA-8666 is superior to protracted irinotecan
and irinotecan plus ganetespib in PDX models of
ES, but not in RMS
Given the striking results obtained with STA-8666
in the cell line-based xenograft models, we tested the agent
in PDX models of both ES and RMS, as PDX models may
be biologically different from xenografts derived from
cell lines. Additionally, our PDX models were obtained
from patients with highly aggressive metastatic disease.
Of note, the RMS PDX was derived from a patient who
had failed treatment with both irinotecan and a second
camptothecin. The ES PDX was derived at diagnosis from
a patient who was drug-naïve. For these experiments, we
compared weekly STA-8666 to protracted dose irinotecan,
and included an additional experimental arm in which

Volume differences were statistically significant between the irinotecan group and the STA-8666 50 mg/kg group (p ≤ 0.007), the STA8666 100 mg/kg group (p ≤ 0.0002), and the STA-8666 150 mg/kg group (p ≤ 0.0003) for days 64 through 85 in the RMS experiment. In
the ES experiment, volume differences were statistically significant between the irinotecan group and the STA-8666 groups for all doses
(p ≤ 0.0002) between days 36 and 54. Lower panel: Kaplan-Meier analysis of overall survival for mice with RH30 (C) and TC32 (D)

p < 0.0001 for irinotecan v. STA-8666 at all three doses). Dose responses on survival in both RMS (p = 0.0003) and ES (p < 0.0001) were
statistically significant (Figure 2C and 2D).

mice received a combination of weekly ganetespib plus
irinotecan on the protracted schedule to test whether there
could be a combinatorial effect of the two drug classes
comprising STA-8666. Tumors of both types grew to
between 600 and 1000 mm3 before treatment began.
Dosing was based on MTD values in the mice used for
these experiments (NOG-F), which were lower than in the
SCID-Beige strain. Mice received irinotecan at 7.5 mg/
kg daily five days per week for two weeks, STA-8666 at
100 mg/kg once a week for two weeks, or the combination
of ganetespib at 100 mg/kg once a week for two weeks
plus the daily irinotecan.
Complete tumor regressions were achieved within
two weeks in all mice in each of the three treatment
arms. As in the prior experiment, mice with the ES
PDX that received irinotecan relapsed first (beginning
at day 81), mice that received the combination relapsed
next (beginning at day 94), and mice that received
STA-8666 relapsed last (beginning at day 111) or not
at all. In the STA-8666 group, 3/6 mice had sustained
complete remissions at day 195, when the experiment
was terminated; this was not seen in either the irinotecan
alone or combination group (Figure 4A). Unadjusted
p-values were ≤ 0.0043 for comparisons made between
tumor volumes of mice in the irinotecan group and STA8666 group for days 87 through 146 and were ≤ 0.0087
for comparisons made between tumor volumes of mice
in the STA-8666 group and the combination group for
days 94 through 143. P-values > 0.05 were obtained
for comparisons of the irinotecan and combination
groups during this same time period. In contrast, mice
harboring the RMS PDX and treated with irinotecan
alone relapsed at the same time as those that received
the combination (beginning at day 115). As in the

ES PDX, mice that received STA-8666 relapsed last
(day 126) (Figure 4B). P-values > 0.05 were obtained
for comparisons between each of the groups from days
118 through 167. No RMS PDX mice in any of the
treatment groups had sustained complete regressions.
Finally, overall survival in the STA-8666 group was
superior for ES (p = 0.0005 for irinotecan v. STA-8666;
p = 0.0008 for STA-8666 v. combination), but not
for RMS (p = 0.3675 for irinotecan v. STA-8666;
p = 0.1922 for STA-8666 v. combination) (Figure 4C
and 4D). These findings are consistent with our previous
data suggesting that (1) ES tumors are more responsive
to STA-8666 compared to RMS tumors, and (2) HSP90
inhibition per se contributed little to the anti-tumor
activity of STA-8666 in either model.

STA-8666 is effective in an irinotecan-resistant
model of metastatic osteosarcoma
Because the RMS PDX was derived from a patient
who had previously failed irinotecan, we investigated
whether STA-8666 would be efficacious in an additional,
non-RMS, irinotecan-resistant pediatric sarcoma model.
For this experiment, we used HU09.H3, a highly
aggressive cell line model of osteosarcoma (OS) that
spontaneously metastasizes in mice. Although clinical data
are limited, published data indicate that patients with OS
generally respond poorly to irinotecan and irinotecan is
not currently a component of OS treatment [12, 14, 34].
For this experiment, tumors were allowed to grow to an
average of 750–900 mm3 and then mice began weekly
treatment with vehicle, irinotecan, or STA-8666. MTD
was used to determine doses as described earlier, and mice
were dosed for two weeks.

Unlike in prior experiments, mice in the irinotecan
group did not experience tumor regression. Although
irinotecan partially slowed tumor growth, irinotecantreated mice survived only two weeks longer than mice
in the vehicle group. However, mice treated with STA8666 uniformly experienced durable tumor regression,
with no evidence of regrowth at 134 days post-tumor
cell inoculation, and superior survival (Figure 5). Due to
the smaller number of mice in this experiment, statistical
significance was approached (p = 0.0571) but not reached.

the dose levels tested at or below the established MTDs for
each mouse strain (Supplementary Figure S3A and S3B).

Duration of γH2AX expression suggests
prolonged camptothecin effect in tumors treated
with STA-8666
The proposed mechanism of action of STA-8666
is based on enhanced delivery and sustained retention of
SN-38 in tumor cells, compared to systemic administration
of irinotecan. To explore the validity of this mechanism,
we examined duration of expression of γH2AX, a
pharmacodynamic marker of topoisomerase 1 inhibition
[35], in tumor samples from treated mice. Mice bearing
TC32 tumors of 800 mm3 were treated with a single dose
of vehicle, irinotecan (IP at 50 mg/kg) or STA-8666 (IV
at 150 mg/kg). One mouse per group was sacrificed on
days 3 and 7. Tumor samples were processed for Western
blot analysis of γH2AX expression (Figure 6). At day 3,

STA-8666 is well tolerated in mice
Tolerability of STA-8666 was monitored by
observation of overall health and weekly weights.
Tolerability was excellent in all experiments performed with
no changes in posture, coat or activity in any mice treated
with the agent. In addition, there were no toxicity-related
deaths or significant weight loss in treated mice at any of

significant between the irinotecan group and STA-8666 group (p ≤ 0.0043) for days 87 through 146 and between the STA-8666 group
and the combination group (p ≤ 0.0087) for days 94 through 143. P-values > 0.05 were obtained for comparisons of the irinotecan and
combination groups during this same time period. For the RMS PDX, p-values > 0.05 were obtained for comparisons between each of the
groups from days 118 through 167. Lower panel: Kaplan-Meier analysis of overall survival for mice with ES PDX (C) and RMS PDX (D)

STA-8666 v. combination), but no significance was seen for RMS (p = 0.3675 for irinotecan v. STA-8666; p = 0.1922 for STA-8666 v.

γH2AX intensity in the tumor treated with STA-8666
was similar to that in the tumor treated with irinotecan.
However, on day 7, while minimal γH2AX was detected
in the irinotecan tumor, it was still readily detectable in the
STA-8666 sample. This is consistent with published data
in breast cancer xenografts showing that γH2AX peaked
1 day post irinotecan treatment and 7–10 days post STA8666 treatment [30], and suggests that in this ES sarcoma
model, STA-8666 likewise causes sustained inhibition of
topoisomerase 1, compared with irinotecan.

ganetespib (IV, 150 mg/kg), irinotecan (IP, 50 mg/kg)
or STA-8666 (IV, 100 mg/kg). Of note, dose levels
of irinotecan and STA-8666 in this experiment were
equimolar. Analysis of target genes showed an overlapping
profile between irinotecan and STA-8666 treated tumors,
with the same top 10 upregulated and downregulated
genes shared between the two groups (Figure 7A and 7B,
and Supplementary Figure S4). For each of these 20
genes, but particularly for the 10 downregulated genes,
the fold-change compared to vehicle control was greater
for the STA-8666 treated tumors than for the irinotecan
treated tumors, suggesting that, 5 days after treatment,
STA-8666 affects expression of DNA damage and repair
genes more robustly than does irinotecan administered at
an equimolar dose. Further, the gene expression profile
of tumors treated with ganetespib overlapped that of

As an additional method to investigate the

Tumor volume differences approached but did not reach statistical significance (p = 0.0571), likely due to the smaller number of mice used
in this experiment.

irinotecan, and not the more highly potent SN-38 [19,
36–39]. Several of these agents are undergoing evaluation
in clinical trials [40–42] and one (Onivyde), a liposomal
form of irinotecan, was recently approved by the FDA.
Antibody conjugates with SN-38, such as the anti-trop-2
ADC (sacituzumab govitecan), show encouraging activity
in early phase clinical trials, but these agents rely on
antibody targeting of surface proteins common to specific
tumor types [43, 44]. Given the heterogeneous group of
irinotecan-responsive cancers, an antibody-based approach
may not be the optimal delivery choice for either the adult
or pediatric patient population.
In this study we have evaluated the efficacy and
toxicity of STA-8666, a unique drug conjugate that relies
on HSP90-based intracellular delivery and prolonged
tumor retention of SN-38, in multiple mouse xenograft
models of pediatric-type sarcoma. In the majority of the
models tested, all dose levels of STA-8666 resulted in
superior tumor regression, longer time to relapse, and
markedly prolonged overall survival compared with the
HSP90 inhibitor ganetespib, irinotecan administered on a
weekly schedule, irinotecan administered on a protracted
schedule, and irinotecan administered in combination with
ganetespib. In addition, STA-8666 treatment resulted in
sustained complete regressions after minimal dosing in
75% of mice with ES (34/45 mice across all dose levels
and models), and in 5% of mice with RMS (2/37 mice
across all dose levels and models), whereas among the 47
mice treated with irinotecan, there was only one sustained
complete regression observed (in an EW8-bearing mouse
treated with protracted irinotecan). Further, treatment with
STA-8666 in an irinotecan-resistant OS model surprisingly
resulted in sustained complete regressions in all mice.
Several dosing regimens were tested in an effort
to thoroughly compare the activity of STA-8666 to
irinotecan, the clinically available form of SN-38. When
equimolar doses (100 mg/kg STA-8666 and 50 mg/kg
irinotecan) were given, STA-8666 was more efficacious in
both ES and RMS, resulting in later relapse and prolonged

DISCUSSION
Irinotecan has emerged as a promising agent for
patients with a variety of cancers that occur both in
the adult population (e.g., colorectal, pancreatic, small
cell lung and gastric cancers) and in pediatric patients
(including sarcomas, neuroblastoma, hepatoblastoma
and malignant glioma). However, challenges regarding
the bioavailability of SN-38 have limited the potential of
irinotecan in the clinic. Furthermore, when metabolized,
irinotecan causes significant systemic toxicity, specifically
myelosuppression and gastrointestinal toxicity (abdominal
pain, nausea/vomiting, cholinergic syndrome, diarrhea)
[10–12, 22, 34], thus reducing tolerability and limiting
the possibility of dose escalation. More importantly, these
toxicities overlap with the side effects of other cytotoxic
therapies to negatively affect the optimal use of irinotecan
in combination with other agents.
Over the last decade, investigators have attempted
to find alternative methods to deliver irinotecan and SN38 in ways that would maximize efficacy and minimize
toxicity. Based on data from preclinical and clinical
studies, ideal properties for delivery of SN-38 would
include ready bioavailability, long exposure time for
tumor tissue, and minimal effect on normal tissue [14, 21].
A number of new investigational approaches for SN-38
and irinotecan delivery have been developed which
include both non-specific and tumor-specific prodrugs,
nanomedicine formulations such as micelles, liposomes
and nanoparticles, and drug-antibody-conjugates
[20]. Preclinical data with nanomedicine formulations
of irinotecan have shown improved retention in the
circulation compared to conventional irinotecan. However,
these agents are still challenged by the other limitations
of irinotecan bioavailability, as the active agent is still

and renal cell carcinoma [45–47]. In contrast, RPS27A
encodes a ribosomal protein that has been implicated in
the promotion of proliferation and inhibition of apoptosis,
and is upregulated in leukemia and colorectal cancer [48,
49]. Further investigation of the impact of topoisomerase
1 inhibition on these and other targets identified by this
analysis is likely a fruitful avenue for future research.
Although further investigation in additional cell
lines is necessary for confirmation, we noted a distinct
difference between ES and RMS xenografts with respect
to both rapidity and duration of response, with ES
models (two cell line-derived xenografts and one PDX
xenograft) being more responsive to STA-8666. This is
likely partially related to differences in inherent sensitivity
of each tumor type to SN-38, but other factors may be
involved (e.g., prior treatment history in the case of the
RMS PDX). Importantly, a third pediatric-type sarcoma
model, osteosarcoma, although not particularly sensitive
to systemic irinotecan, displayed remarkable in vivo
sensitivity to STA-8666. In conclusion, we believe that
the data presented here warrant clinical evaluation of
STA-8666 in patients with pediatric-type sarcomas.

overall survival. Furthermore, STA-8666 retained superior
efficacy in both ES and RMS, even when tested at half
the equimolar dose of irinotecan. However, since the
presumed advantage of STA-8666 is related to tumor
localization and duration of exposure, using equimolar
doses may not be the most appropriate way to compare
these agents. Thus, we additionally compared a protracted
dosing schedule of irinotecan to weekly STA-8666 using
the MTDs of each agent in the specific strains of mice,
which is a clinically relevant means for comparison. In
all but one case (RMS PDX, derived from an irinotecanrefractory tumor), STA-8666 resulted in superior
outcomes, compared to irinotecan.
Data
describing
the
pharmacokinetic/
pharmacodynamic relationship of STA-8666 in breast
cancer models indicate that SN-38 from STA-8666 is
detectable at high nanomolar levels in tumors 10 days
post-dose, which correlates with the continued presence
of high nuclear γH2AX expression. In contrast, SN-38 is
undetectable in tumors 3 days post-irinotecan, consistent
with the rapid drop in nuclear γH2AX expression [30].
Although tumor pharmacokinetics were not directly
studied in our sarcoma models, pharmacodynamic analysis
of γH2AX expression in ES xenograft tumors supports this
mechanism. Specifically, γH2AX was readily detected
in tumor samples from mice 7 days after a single dose
of STA-8666, whereas mice receiving irinotecan had no
detectable γH2AX at this time point. Analysis of γH2AX
expression in our models at later time points was limited
by the sensitivity of our models to STA-8666, since the
resultant rapid tumor shrinkage impeded tissue collection
beyond 7 days post-treatment. The observation that none
of the STA-8666 treated mice experienced clinical signs
of toxicity during or after treatment suggests that even
in the context of prolonged topoisomerase 1 inhibition
in the tumor, STA-8666 may spare normal tissue from
such exposure. STA-8666 thus meets the aforementioned
criteria of an ideal SN-38 delivery system in that it is
easily bioavailable, produces prolonged exposure in
tumors and is well tolerated.
Results from the analysis of changes in RNA
expression across a panel of known DNA damage and
repair genes in tumors treated with STA-8666, irinotecan
or ganetespib lend further support to the proposed
mechanism of action. Further mechanistic insight may be
gained from an examination of the functions of the most
strongly affected genes, PIK3R1 (expression increased
70-fold with STA-8666 and 50-fold with irinotecan)
and RPS27A (expression decreased 16-fold with STA8666 and 10-fold with irinotecan). While the expression
of these genes has not been examined in ES, differential
expression of both have been linked to certain cancers.
PIK3R1 encodes the regulatory subunit of PI3K (p85α),
and reports in the literature have identified it as a tumor
suppressor in a number of different malignancies, with low
expression correlating with poor prognosis in breast cancer

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell lines
RMS cell line RH30 has been previously described
[50]. ES cell lines TC32 and EW8 have been previously
described [51]. OS cell line HU09.H3 has been previously
described [52]. The cells were maintained in RPMI growth
medium (Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY) with 10%
FBS, heat-inactivated (Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO),
100 U/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Life
Technologies), and 2 mM L-glutamine (Life Technologies)
at 37°C in an atmosphere of 5% CO, prior to injection.

Patient derived xenografts
Transplantable xenografts of primary human RMS
(XEN-RMS-041) and ES (XEN-EWS-021) were obtained
from the Molecular Oncology Section of the Pediatric
Oncology Branch (CCR /NCI/National Institutes of
Health). The creation of these xenografts was approved by
the Institutional Review Board of the National Institutes
of Health, and patients gave informed consent for their
creation. Confirmation of molecular signature (EWSR1FLI1 translocation for ES PDX, and PAX3-FOXO1
translocation for RMS PDX) was performed by PCR prior
to injection.

Animals
Animal studies were performed in accordance with
the guidelines of the National Institutes of Health Animal
Care and Use Committee. For experiments with TC32,

EW8 and RH30 cell lines, four- to six-week-old female
Fox Chase SCID beige mice (CB17.B6-Prkdcscid Lystbg /
Crl) were purchased from Charles River Laboratories
(Wilmington, MA). Two million cells were put into a
solution of HBSS and Geltrex LDEV-free reduced growth
factor basement membrane matrix, mixed at a 1:1 ratio
(Life Technologies), and injected orthotopically into the
gastrocnemius muscle in the left hind leg. Mice were
randomized after tumors developed, but prior to the start
of treatment. Treatment with agents began on day 10, in
the initial pilot experiment, when tumor was palpable, and
on day 19 (TC32), day 33 (RH30), or day 34 (EW8) in
the expanded experiments, when tumors were an average
of 800–1000 mm3. For experiments with HU09.H3,
two million cells were put into a solution of HBSS and
injected orthotopically into the gastrocnemius muscle in
the left hind leg of SCID beige mice (described above).
Treatment with agents began on day 51, when tumors were
an average of 750–900 mm3.
For PDX experiments, four- to six-week-old female
NOG-F Homozygous/Homozygous NOD.Cg-Prkdcscid
Il2rgtm1Sug/JicTac mice were purchased from Taconic
Biosciences (Derwood, MD). PDX cells were thawed
and put into a solution of HBSS and Geltrex LDEVfree reduced growth factor basement membrane matrix,
mixed at a 1:1 ratio. 100 uL of this solution was injected
orthotopically into the gastrocnemius muscle in the left
hind leg. Mice were randomized after tumors developed,
but prior to the start of treatment. Treatment with agents
began on day 38 for the ES PDX and day 59 for the RMS
PDX, when tumors were an average of 600–1000 mm3.
All mice were maintained in a pathogen-free
environment. Tumors were measured twice per week
with calipers, and mice were monitored by observation
of overall health and weekly weights to determine
drug tolerability. Tumor volume was calculated by the
following formula: V (mm3) = (D x d2)/6 x 3.14, Where
D is the longest tumor axis and d is the shortest tumor
axis. Tumors were harvested at midpoints and at study
endpoint for biology studies. Treatment with ganetespib at
50 mg/kg (pilot experiments), 150 mg/kg (experiments
with irinotecan arms) or 100 mg/kg (PDX experiments) and
STA-8666 (50, 100 or 150 mg/kg) was given by tail
vein injection on a weekly basis. Treatment with
irinotecan was given at 50 mg/kg by intraperitoneal
injection on a weekly basis (TC32, RH30, HU09.H3) or
10–mg/kg intraperitoneal injection daily five days per week
for two weeks (EW8) for the cell line experiments, and at
7.5 mg/kg by intraperitoneal injection daily five days per
week for two weeks for the PDX experiments. 

The chemical structure of STA-8666 has been previously
published [30]. Stock solutions were prepared by
reconstitution in DMSO, aliquoted, and stored at −20°C.
For in vivo studies, immediately prior to injection, aliquots
were thawed and diluted 1:10 with 20% Kolliphor RH
40/80% D5W (Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO). For STA8666, a volume of 2N NaOH, equivalent to 1.6% of the
total solution volume, was then added to ensure solubility.
Irinotecan hydrochloride (20 mg/mL) was obtained from
the Veterinary Pharmacy at the NIH and diluted to desired
concentration with sterile saline immediately prior to
injection.

Protein analysis
Tumor lysates were prepared by measuring 50 mg
of frozen tumor sample and homogenizing in 1 mL T-PER
Tissue Protein Extraction Reagent (Life Technologies) plus
phosphatase and protease inhibitors (Life Technologies).
Protein lysates (30–100 ug/lane), quantified by BCA
protein assay (Life Technologies), were separated by
4–12% SDS–PAGE (Life Technologies) and transferred
to nitrocellulose membranes (Amersham Pharmacia
Biotech, Piscataway, NJ). Membranes were blocked with
5% nonfat dried milk in TBS (KPL, Gaithersburg, MD)Tween20 (Sigma Aldrich) (20 mM Tris-HCI, pH 7.5; 8 g/l
of sodium chloride; 0.1% Tween 20) and then incubated
with primary antibodies against phosphorylated histone
γH2AX (Cell Signaling) at 1:1000.

Xenograft statistical analysis
Tumor volumes were compared between groups
using a Wilcoxon rank-sum test at serial time points
selected to be appropriate according to the data being
presented in each plot. Measurements for mice that had
already reached endpoint were carried forward until all
mice in the group had reached endpoint, or the experiment
was terminated.
Mantel-Cox analysis was performed to compare
survival of mice in each of the irinotecan groups to each of
the comparison groups (Figures 2C, 2D, 3B, 4C and 4D).
A log-rank test for trend was performed to compare doses
of STA-8666 (Figure 2C and 2D).

Gene expression analysis
Tumor xenograft samples were fixed in formalin
for 16 hours and stored in 70% ethanol at 4°C. Total
RNA was isolated using the RNeasy FFPE kit (Qiagen,
Valencia, CA). RNA samples were analyzed on the
NanoString nCounter Analysis platform (NanoString
Technologies, Seattle, WA) for digital quantitation of
expression of genes associated with DNA damage and
repair (nCounter Vantage DNA Damage and Repair Panel,
with probes for 180 target genes and 12 housekeeping

in 7 ml aliquots, plus target-specific oligonucleotide
probe pairs, fluorescently-labeled specific reporter
tags, and a biotinylated universal capture tag. Analysis
and normalization of the raw data were conducted
using nSolver Analysis Software v2.6 (NanoString
Technologies). Raw counts were normalized to internal
levels. A background count level was estimated using the
average count of the 8 negative control probes in every
reaction plus 2 SDs.
All normalized 180 target gene copy number results
from the NanoString analysis were imported into the
Partek Genomics Suite (version 6.6, Partek Inc., St. Louis,
MO) for determination of differential gene expression
profiles using analysis of variance (ANOVA) based on
treatment. Three samples treated once with irinotecan,
STA-8666, or ganetespib five days prior to tumor harvest
were compared to three samples treated once with vehicle
five days prior to tumor harvest. ANOVA results were
imported into Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) software
(Ingenuity® Systems, Redwood City, CA, http://www.
