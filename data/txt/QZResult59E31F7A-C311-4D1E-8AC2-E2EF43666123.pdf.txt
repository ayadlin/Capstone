Abstract
The novel recombinant anthrax toxin, PrAgU2/FP59, composed of the urokinase-activated protective antigen and a
fusion protein of Pseudomonas exotoxin and lethal factor was
tested for anti–lung cancer efficacy in an in vivo human tumor
model. Male athymic nude mice (age 4–6 weeks) were
inoculated s.c. with 10 million H1299 non–small cell lung
cancer (NSCLC) cells in the left flank. When tumor volumes
reached 200 mm3 (6–8 days), i.p. injection of 100 ML saline or
different ratios and doses of PrAgU2/FP59 in 100 ML saline
were given every 3 days for four doses and an additional dose
at day 29. Animals were monitored twice daily and tumor
measurements were made by calipers. The maximum tolerated doses of PrAgU2/FP59 differed dependent on the ratios of
PrAgU2 to FP59 over the range of 3:1 to 25:1, respectively. At
tolerated doses, tumor regressions were seen in all animals.
Complete histologic remission lasting 60 days occurred in 30%
of animals. PrAgU2/FP59 showed dramatic anti-NSCLC efficacy and warrants further clinical development for therapy of
patients with advanced NSCLC. [Cancer Res 2007;67(7):3329–36]

Introduction
Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related mortality in
the United States, of which most cases are non–small cell lung
cancer (NSCLC; 1). More than three quarters of all patients of
NSCLC present with locally advanced or widespread metastatic
disease and are incurable with surgery, radiotherapy, or chemotherapy (2). A novel therapeutic approach for these patients is
immunotoxins, peptide toxins coupled to antibodies or ligands
reactive with NSCLC cells. Mesothelin and erbB-2 targeted
immunotoxins have been tested in tissue culture and animal
models of NSCLC (3, 4). We chose to examine another molecule
overexpressed in NSCLC-urokinase plasminogen activator (uPA).
uPA is a protease overexpressed on a significant number of solid
tumors, including NSCLC (5). Its presence is associated with
increased tumor tissue invasiveness and metastatic potential (6).
The urokinase receptor (uPAR) is also overexpressed in NSCLC and
recruits uPA to the tumor cell microenvironment (7). Up-regulation

of uPA/uPAR in tumors and general absence on normal cells make
the uPA/uPAR system an attractive target for cancer therapy.
Several inhibitors of uPA/uPAR have been designed and tested
clinically yielding only limited tumor-static effects (8–10). Immunotoxins have also been synthesized, which target uPAR. These
have included recombinant proteins with the NH2 terminus of uPA
fused to saporin and diphtheria toxin and have yielded antitumor
activity both in vitro and animal models (11, 12). Our laboratory
took another approach to target uPA and uPAR on NSCLC tumor
cells by using the protease activity of the uPA/uPAR complex to
activate a different potent catalytic and cytolytic peptide toxin,
anthrax lethal toxin.
Anthrax lethal toxin is a binary protein that consists of
protective antigen (PrAg) and lethal factor (LF). PrAg binds to
ubiquitously distributed anthrax receptors, tumor endothelial
marker-8 and capillary morphogenesis gene-2 associated with
the coreceptor, low density lipoprotein receptor–related protein 6
(13–15). After binding, PrAg is cleaved by furin on the cell surface,
and the 63-kDa receptor-bound PrAg fragments spontaneously
heptamize and bind up to three copies of LF via the LF NH2terminal domains. The complexes internalize from lipid rafts into
acidic endosomes where membrane-spanning pores facilitate the
escape of unfolded LF molecules to the cytosol (16, 17). After
refolding, the LF cleaves the mitogen-activated protein kinase
kinases, which leads to cell dysfunction or cell death (18).
To achieve uPA/uPAR targeting and enhance the catalytic
potency, the furin cleavage fragment of PrAg 164RKKR167 was
substituted with a urokinase cleavage sequence 164SGRSA168
termed PrAgU2. LF residues 1 to 254, which bind the PA63
receptor, were fused with the 38-kDa ADP-ribosylation catalytic
domain of Pseudomonas aeruginosa exotoxin A to form FP59 (19).
PrAgU2 together with FP59 constitutes a potent prodrug that is
activated on tumor cells expressing uPA. FP59 is then delivered into
cytoplasm through PA-LF interaction, where the Pseudomonas
exotoxin A ADP-ribosylation domain catalyzes ADP attachment to
the diphthamide residue of elongation factor 2 and blocks protein
synthesis. PrAgU2/FP59 has potent and selective cytotoxicity to
uPA/uPAR–expressing NSCLC with 14 of 20 NSCLC lines showing
EC50 <40 pmol/L (20). Intratumoral injection of PrAgU2/FP59 given
to Lewis lung carcinoma–bearing mice induced transient (1 week)
tumor growth inhibition (21). A pilot study of systemically
administrated in PrAgU2/FP59 in Lewis lung carcinoma–bearing
mice showed modest tumor growth inhibition lasting 1 week at
doses causing 33% lethality (22). We now want to determine
accurately the safety and efficacy of systemically administrated
PrAgU2/FP59 in an in vivo athymic nude mice model of human
NSCLC.

Materials and Methods
Cells. H1299 and H1703 were purchased from the American Type Culture
Collection (Manassas, VA) and cultured in RPMI 1640 with 2 mmol/L
L-glutamine adjusted to contain 1.5 g/L sodium bicarbonate, 4.5 g/L
glucose, 90% HEPES, 1.0 mmol/L of 90% sodium pyruvate, 10% fetal bovine
serum, and 1% penicillin/streptomycin.
Toxins. Both PrAgU2 and FP59 were expressed and purified as described
previously (23, 24).
Animals. Male BALB/c and athymic nude mice (nu / ), 4 to 6 weeks
old, were purchased from Charles River Laboratories (Wilmington, MA) and
maintained in a ventilated rack system. Irradiated food and autoclaved
water were provided ad libitum. The mice were allowed to adjust to their
environment for 1 week before the initiation of experiments.
Maximum tolerated dose studies. BALB/c mice (six per group) were
injected i.p. with increasing doses of PrAgU2/FP59 at one of the following
ratios of PrAgU2 to FP59 (3:1, 6:1, 10:1, and 25:1) in combination with
15 mg/kg dexamethasone every 3 days for a total of eight injections. Mice
were monitored twice daily for signs of toxicity. Mice that presented with
dehydration, hypothermia, and/or dyspnea were considered moribund and
euthanized following institutional regulations. Samples from major organs
were removed, fixed in 10% buffered formaldehyde, and dehydrated and
embedded in paraffin. Sections were stained with H&E and examined under
microscope. All surviving mice were euthanized at day 60 postinjection.
Antitumor efficacy studies. Athymic nude mice (nu / ) were injected
i.p. with 75 Ag of a rat anti-mouse asialo GM1 antibody (Wako Chemical
Co., Richmond, VA) to reduce natural killer cells. Injections were done on
days 4 and 2 before the injection of H1299 cells. At day 0, mice were
injected s.c. in the left flank with 107 H1299 cells in 100 AL serum-free
medium. Three groups of mice (10 mice per group) were then treated i.p.
with one of two different doses of PrAgU2/FP59 (0.36 mg/kg PrAgU2/0.06
mg/kgFP59 and 0.5 mg/kg PrAgU2/0.05 mg/kg FP59 in 100 AL PBS) or with
vehicle alone (PBS) in combination with 15 mg/kg dexamethasone, every
3 days for four total injections starting at day 7 post-tumor inoculations,
with one additional injection at day 29. Animals were observed twice daily
and tumor size was measured twice weekly with calipers, based on the
formula L  W 2 where L is the length and W is the width of the tumor.
Moribund mice and mice whose tumor burdens exceeded 20% of their body
weight were euthanized as described above. All mice were euthanized at
days 60 post-tumor injection following institutional regulation. Tumor
tissues were removed for immunohistochemical staining and in vitro tumor
cell cytotoxicity assay.
Tumor sensitivity assay. Tumors from vehicle-treated animals as well
as residual/regrown tumors from PrAgU2/FP59–treated animals were
recultured. Briefly, tumors were washed in PBS, dispersed in a 0.25%
trypsin/EDTA solution, and dispersed in H1299 recommended growth
medium. Cytotoxicity assays were done by using Cell Counting Kit-8
(Dojindo Molecular Technologies, Inc., Gaithersburg, MD). Cells were plated
in 96-well flat-bottomed plates at 104 cells per well and cultured in the
growth medium overnight. On the next day, fresh medium was replaced
containing 10 9 mol/L FP59 and a range of PrAgU2 between 3  10 8 to
10 13 mol/L and cultured at 37jC/5% CO2 for 48 h. At the indicated time
points, cell viability in quadruplicate wells were assessed as the absorbance
(450 nm) of reduced WST-8 [2-(2-methoxy-4-nitrophenyl)-3-(4-nitrophenyl)5-(2,4-disulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium, monosodium salt; Dojindo Molecular
Technologies].
Immunofluorescent staining of cell lines. Cells were cultured overnight on glass coverslips in 24-well culture plates. On the next day, after
blocking with 5% goat serum and streptavidin, cells were incubated with
primary antibodies diluted in blocking buffer for 1 h on ice and then
detected with secondary antibodies. Coverslips were mounted on glass
slides with 4¶,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole mounting medium. uPA was
detected with biotinylated antihuman uPA antibody (1:500 dilution; R&D
Systems, Minneapolis, MN) and visualized with Oregon green–conjugated
streptavidin (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA); uPAR was detected with mouse
anti-human uPAR (1:500 dilution; America Diagnostica, Inc., Stamford, CT)
and visualized with Alexa 594–conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Invitrogen).

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (7). April 1, 2007

Histologic analysis. The organs (liver, spleen, heart, lung, kidney, testis,
small intestine, and brain) and tumors were fixed for 24 h in 10% buffered
formaldehyde and dehydrated and embedded in paraffin. Sections were
stained with H&E and subjected to microscopic analysis.
Immunohistochemical analysis. Tumors from vehicle- and PrAgU2/
FP59–treated animals were harvested, fixed for 24 h in 10% buffered
formaldehyde, dehydrated and embedded in paraffin, sectioned, rehydrated,
blocked with 10% goat serum, and reacted with mouse anti-human uPA
(NeoMarkers/LabVision, Fremont, CA) or mouse anti-uPAR (Zymed, San
Francisco, CA). Immunostaining was done with a Vectastain avidin-biotin
complex method kit (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA), with 3,3¶diaminobenzidine as chromogenic substrate using horseradish peroxidase–
conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG.
Advanced tumor therapy with PrgU2/FP59. Thirty days after
antitumor efficacy study, five mice bearing tumors (mean F SE, 1,398 F
127 mm3) from PBS-treated group were treated i.p. with PrAgU2/FP59
(0.36 mg/kg PrAgU2/0.06 mg/kgFP59 100 AL PBS) in combination with
15 mg/kg dexamethasone every 5 days for two total injections. Animals
were observed twice daily and tumor size was measured once weekly as
described above. On day 11, animals were euthanized following institutional
regulations and tumors were harvested and processed as above. Apoptosis
was visualized by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase–mediated dUTP
nick end labeling (TUNEL) by using Apoptag kit (Serologicals, Norcross,
GA), proliferating cells were tested by staining of sections with mouse anti–
Ki-67 antibody (NeoMarkers/LabVision), and angiogenesis was visualized by
staining with mouse anti-CD34 antibodies (NeoMarkers/LabVision) Immunostaining was done as introduced above.
Statistics. Survival was analyzed by Kaplan-Meier method. For comparison of tumor volume and EC50s, a Mann-Whitney or Kruskall-Wallis test was
used. Significance of differences was measured at P < 0.05. Statistical
analyses were done with GraphPad Prism software (GraphPad Software,
San Diego, CA).

Results
PrAgU2/FP59 is cytotoxic to uPA/uPAR–expressing NSCLC
cell. Two different human NSCLC cells, H1299 and H1703, were
tested for their sensitivities to PrAgU2/FP59. Cytotoxicity assays
of PrAgU2/FP59 on H1299 yielded an EC50 of 3.5 pmol/L after
48 h incubation. H1703 cells had an EC50 >10,000 pmol/L under
the same treatment condition (Fig. 1A). H1299 but not H1703
expressed high level of cell surface uPA as shown by immunofluorescent staining. uPAR was expressed on both cell lines (Fig. 1B).
We chose H1299 cells for in vivo efficacy studies of PrAgU2/FP59.
Maximum tolerated dose and dose-limiting toxicity of
PrAgU2/FP59. PrAgU2/FP59 is composed of two protein moieties.
We therefore needed to evaluate the effects of different ratios of
PrAgU2 and FP59 on in vivo toxicity. As shown in Fig. 2A, the
maximum tolerated doses (MTD) of PrAgU2/FP59 in combination
with 15 mg/kg dexamethasone i.p. injected every 3 days for eight
doses were 0.3:0.1, 0.36:0.06, 0.5:0.05, and 1:0.04 mg/kg for the
increasing ratios of PrAgU2 to FP59 over the range of 3:1, 6:1, 10:1,
and 25:1, respectively. No deaths were observed at the MTD of all
24 animals ( four groups of six). In contrast, animals that received
0.45:0.15 mg/kg (ratio 3:1), 0.6:0.2 mg/kg (ratio 3:1), 0.45:0.075 mg/
kg (ratio 6:1), 0.6:0.1 mg/kg (ratio 6:1), 0.8:0.08 mg/kg (ratio 10:1),
and 1.25:0.05 mg/kg (ratio 25:1) had mortalities of 67%, 50%, 50%,
33%, 50%, and 67%, respectively. Figure 2B showed the relationship
between the ratios of PrAgU2 to FP59 versus the concentration of
FP59. Values in the shadow area were associated with no mortality.
Concurrent administration of dexamethasone significantly
reduced the dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) and reduced animal
mortality related to PrAgU2/FP59 treatment. As shown in Fig. 3A,
two i.p. injections of 0.36:0.06 mg/kg PrAgU2/FP59 every 3 days

without concurrent administration of dexamethasone caused >80%
animal death and the rest of the animals became moribund with
fur ruffling and loss of activity by day 9. Necropsies of dead or
terminal ill animals showed profound histologic damage to kidney,
liver, and heart with vessels displaying severe angiectasis, vascular
stasis, and hemorrhaging (Fig. 3B). Lung and kidney also showed
dramatic vacuolization that might be a result of cell necrosis
induced by this toxin (Fig. 3B). The spleen, brain, small intestine,
and testis were not affected by PrAgU2/FP59 treatment showing
no sign of histologic toxicity (Supplementary Data). Concurrent
administration of 15 mg/kg dexamethasone, instead, kept all
animals alive with no outward signs of toxicity (Fig. 3A). Necropsies
of animal showed no sign of histologic cytotoxicity on all major
organs, including kidney, liver, heart, lung, spleen, brain, small
intestine, and testis (Fig. 3B).
Human NSCLC tumor growth in athymic nude mice. Athymic
nude mice (n = 10) treated with anti-asialo GM1 antibody were
inoculated with 107 H1299 cells. After a long lag phase, s.c tumors
had rapid tumor growth. Mean F SE tumor volume was f200
mm3 after 22 days, then doubled in volume to 430 F 53 mm3 by
day 29, and then doubled again (794 F 154 mm3) by day 33. The
mean tumor volume continued to double with a doubling time
of f4 days until animals were sacrificed on day 36 (1,768 F
356 mm3). With 10 animals per group and the observed SD, we
detected a 50% tumor growth inhibition, with two-sided type I
error of 5% and a power 0.9. Pathology of the tumor confirmed the
malignant histology.

four doses. Treatments were 0.18:0.03 mg/kg (PrAgU2/FP59),
0.25:0.025 mg/kg (PrAgU2/FP59), or saline in combination with
15 mg/kg dexamethasone (Fig. 4A). On day 29, the saline control
tumors were 430 F 53 mm3. The two groups of the PrAgU2/FP59–
treated tumors were only 34 F 8 mm3 (PrAgU2/FP59, 6:1;
P = 0.0008 versus control) and 75 F 17 mm3 (PrAgU2/FP59, 10:1;
P = 0.0002 versus control), respectively. On day 29, both PrAgU2/
FP59 groups received one additional treatment at the same dose
and ratio. On day 33, the PBS-treated tumors were 794 F 155 mm3,
and the PrAgU2/FP59-treated tumors were 27 F 12 mm3 (PrAgU2/
FP59, 6:1 compared with PBS treated; P = 0.0008) and 47 F 15 mm3
(PrAgU2/FP59, 10:1 compared with PBS treated; P = 0.0002),
respectively. By day 58, 3 of 10 (30%) from 6:1 ratio group and 3 of 9
(33%) from 10:1 ratio group PrAgU2/FP59–treated mice remained
in complete remission by both gross and histologic examination.
NSCLC cells harvested from relapsing tumors and tumors of
PBS-treated group were examined for their sensitivities in tissue
culture to PrAgU2/FP59. Relapsed tumor cells remained sensitive
to PrAgU2/FP59 with EC50s of 1.6 pmol/L (PrAgU2/FP59, 6:1) and
3.6 pmol/L (PrAgU2/FP59, 10:1), respectively, versus 1.9 pmol/L for
PBS-treated tumor cells (Fig. 4B). Immunohistochemical staining
showed that both relapsing tumors and tumors of PBS-treated
group retained uPA and uPAR expressions (Fig. 4C).
Tumoricidal activity of PrAgU2/FP59 on established tumor.
We evaluated the therapeutic efficacy of PrAgU2/FP59 on
established H1299 NSCLC tumors. Nude mice bearing solid s.c.
tumor nodules constituting 1.5% to 3% of the total body mass on
day 36 post-tumor inoculation were treated with two i.p. injections
of PrAgU2/FP59 (0.36:0.06 mg/kg) in combination with 15 mg/kg
dexamethasone at 5 days interval (Fig. 5A). The tumors were highly

susceptible to PrAgU2/FP59 treatment. The first and second
treatment caused 56% and 78% reduction in the size of H1299
NSCLC tumors compared with the size of tumor before treatment,
respectively. Immunohistologic analysis of tumor tissues revealed
dramatic tumor cell cytotoxicity after PrAgU2/FP59 administration.

Tumor cells underwent massive necrotic cell death with predominant cession of Ki-67 and H&E staining (Fig. 5B). Moreover, tumor
cell apoptosis was manifested by TUNEL staining 24 h after drug
administration, showing apparent cytoplasmic shrinkage and
nuclear condensation (Fig. 5B). Previous study suggested that

PrAgU2/FP59 produces tumor endothelial cell damage (21).
However, in current assay, we did not observe any histologic
damage to tumor blood vessel endothelial cells by CD34 staining
(Fig. 5B).

Discussion
In the current study, we have investigated the anti-NSCLC
activity of PrAgU2/FP59 fusion toxin. We observed remarkable
anti-NSCLC efficacy both in tissue culture and in s.c. nude mouse
xenograft with the uPA/uPAR–positive H1299 cell line. Importantly,
direct tumor killing rather than growth inhibition was found.
Further studies will be needed to extend these findings to other
NSCLC cell lines and other models, such as orthotopic lung cancer
models (25).
Higher ratios of PrAgU2 to FP59 produced greater animal
toxicity. Time of death and histopathology were similar in all
treated animals. Because PrAgU2 is required for toxin delivery,

www.aacrjournals.org

higher ratios likely enhance the uptake of FP59 by particular
normal tissues leading to toxicity.
The DLT of PrAgU2/FP59 seemed to be the multiorgan endothelial damage with vascular injury to the kidney, liver, lung, and
heart. Epithelial vacuolization was also seen in the lung and kidney.
The spleen, brain, small intestine, and testis were not affected by
PrAgU2/FP59 treatment showing no sign of histologic toxicity.
These findings are consistent with the distribution anthrax toxin
receptors on endothelial cells in multiple organs (13–15). At high
dose, nonspecific activation of the toxicity may have occurred in
tissues. Incubation in vitro of PrAgU2/FP59 with mouse serum did
not lead to activation, suggesting that the drug is not activated in
the bloodstream but at tissue sites.4
Dexamethasone reduced toxicity of PrAgU2/FP59 in vivo. Our
in vitro studies also showed that dexamethasone attenuates the

cytotoxic effect on human vascular endothelial cells.4 The mechanism for this protection is unknown but may involve antiapoptotic
effects in endothelial cells as has been observed with endothelial
serum deprivation (26). Dexamethasone has been shown previously
to reduce vascular leak with other immunotoxins, including
DAB389IL2, BR96-Pseudomonas exotoxin, and BR96-doxorubicin
without impairing antitumor efficacy (27–29). Alternatively, steroids
may decrease uPA/uPAR expression in normal cells. Normal
mammary epithelial, renal cells, and macrophages had reduced
uPA and uPAR expression after dexamethasone incubation (30–32).
A large number of preclinical studies have been done testing
anti-NSCLC agents in athymic mice bearing human tumor
xenografts. Single-agent therapy showed tumor growth inhibition
of 34%, 50%, 72%, 82%, 84%, and 85% for cetuximab, radiation
therapy, gefitinib, erlotinib, gemcitabine, and cisplatin, respectively
(33–35). In contrast, PrAgU2/FP59 produced complete tumor
regressions and a 30% apparent histologic cure rate. Because each
of the listed treatments are currently used for NSCLC patients and
have shown clinical benefit, we expect that PrAgU2/FP59 will also
have a favorable therapeutic index in NSCLC patients. Because
direct comparisons were not made with the established cytotoxic
agents in our experiments, we cannot compare accurately efficacy.
Relapsed tumors retained uPA/uPAR expression and PrAgU2/
FP59 sensitivity, suggesting incomplete penetration of the drug

during the initial treatment. We observed regression on retreatment of previously treated tumors, suggesting that such a
strategy may be useful clinically. Moreover, an orthotropic
NSCLC animal model might be better in predicting the
therapeutic effect of i.v. administered PrAgU2/FP59, which is
our future study in plan. Because of the likely immunogenicity of
these nonhuman proteins similar to other immunotoxins (36),
methods will need to be developed to reduce the humoral
immune responses. Moreover, pharmacokinetics with respect of
drug distribution and metabolism will have to be investigated to
establish the optimal administration for treatment of human
malignancies.
Combination therapy of PrAgU2/FP59 with other NSCLC drugs
leads to tumor cell death by different mechanisms and should
produce improved antitumor efficacy in patients. Previous
experiences of monoclonal antibodies (mAb) in combination with
chemotherapy for lymphoma and breast cancer suggested the
usefulness of this approach (37, 38). We have also observed
previously the synergy of immunotoxin with DNA-damaging
cytotoxic drugs (39–41).
The remarkable antitumor activity of PrAgU2/FP59 on late
established tumor was unexpected and portends well for the
behavior of this drug in patients with large advanced NSCLC tumor

0.18:0.03 mg/kg (!), or a 10:1 ratio of PrAgU2/FP59 at 0.25:0.025 mg/kg (y); all treatments were in combination with concurrent administration of 15 mg/kg
dexamethasone. Filled arrows, treatment times. Points, mean; bars, SE. B, tumor cells harvested from PBS-treated tumor and relapsed tumors after either 0.18:0.03 or
0.25:0.025 mg/kg PrAgU2/FP59 treatments were sensitive to PrAgU2/FP59 treatment in vitro , with EC50s of 1.9, 1.6, and 3.6 pmol/L, respectively. C, tumors treated
with PBS or relapsed after 0.18:0.03 mg/kg PrAgU2/FP59 treatment still express uPA and uPAR.

Figure 5. Potent tumoricidal activity of PrAgU2/FP59. A, athymic nude mice bearing established H1299 NSCLC tumors were injected i.p. with 0.36:0.06 mg/kg
PrAgU2/FP59 in combination with 15 mg/kg dexamethasone twice every 5 d. The tumor size was measured at days 5 and 10. B, tumors collected from PrAgU2/FP59–
or PBS-treated mice were detected by Ki-67, H&E, and CD34 staining. TUNEL assay of tumor tissues 24 h after one single i.p. injection of either PBS or 360:60 mg/kg

the predominant tumoricidal activity of PrAgU2/FP59, although it
also induces massive apoptosis within 24 h of drug administration.
The infrequent apoptotic cells observed in PBS-treated tumors
could only be a result of natural cell death. We are not sure if the
antiangiogenesis is a major mechanism for PrAgU2/FP59. The
CD34 staining suggested that there is no angiogenic difference
between PrAgU2/FP59–treated and untreated tumors. However,
the dexamethasone administered along with PrAgU2/FP59 might
alienate the drug-related endothelial damage. A more detailed
study on the angiogenic effect of this drug is now under

agent in vivo and warrants further development for therapy for
NSCLC patients.
