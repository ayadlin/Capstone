Abstract
More effective therapeutic approaches for castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) are urgently needed,
thus reinforcing the need to understand how prostate tumors progress to castration resistance. We have
established a novel mouse xenograft model of prostate cancer, KUCaP-2, which expresses the wild-type androgen receptor (AR) and which produces the prostate-specific antigen (PSA). In this model, tumors regress
soon after castration, but then reproducibly restore their ability to proliferate after 1 to 2 months without AR
mutation, mimicking the clinical behavior of CRPC. In the present study, we used this model to identify
novel therapeutic targets for CRPC. Evaluating tumor tissues at various stages by gene expression profiling,
we discovered that the prostaglandin E receptor EP4 subtype (EP4) was significantly upregulated during
progression to castration resistance. Immunohistochemical results of human prostate cancer tissues confirmed that EP4 expression was higher in CRPC compared with hormone-naïve prostate cancer. Ectopic
overexpression of EP4 in LNCaP cells (LNCaP-EP4 cells) drove proliferation and PSA production in the absence of androgen supplementation in vitro and in vivo. Androgen-independent proliferation of LNCaP-EP4
cells was suppressed when AR expression was attenuated by RNA interference. Treatment of LNCaP-EP4
cells with a specific EP4 antagonist, ONO-AE3-208, decreased intracellular cyclic AMP levels, suppressed
PSA production in vitro, and inhibited castration-resistant growth of LNCaP-EP4 or KUCaP-2 tumors in vivo.
Our findings reveal that EP4 overexpression, via AR activation, supports an important mechanism for
castration-resistant progression of prostate cancer. Furthermore, they prompt further evaluation of EP4
antagonists as a novel therapeutic modality to treat CRPC. Cancer Res; 70(4); 1606–15. ©2010 AACR.

Introduction
Prostate cancer is one of the most frequently diagnosed
cancers in the Western world (1). Because prostate cancer
development is initially dependent on androgens, medical
or surgical castration is the mainstay therapy for patients
with advanced prostate cancer. However, most patients ultimately relapse after a period of initial response to this therapy, progressing to castration-resistant prostate cancer

(CRPC). Effective therapeutic approaches for CRPC are extremely limited. Treatment with docetaxel was established
as a new standard of care for CRPC patients (2). However,
it is not curative, and optimal timing of administration remains controversial. Consequently, it is highly desirable to
explore new therapeutic strategies based on detailed molecular mechanisms for the development of castration resistance in prostate cancer.
The generation of suitable in vivo models is critical to
better understand the processes associated with the development and progression of prostate cancer. We have previously
reported a novel prostate cancer xenograft model named
KUCaP-1 (previously referred to as KUCaP; ref. 3). KUCaP-1
tumors harbor the W741C mutant androgen receptor (AR),
regress soon after castration in mice, and do not regrow with
long-term follow-up (4). We have now established another
novel xenograft model named KUCaP-2 using locally recurrent CRPC specimens derived from a different patient. The
KUCaP-2 tumors harbor wild-type AR, regress soon after
castration, and restore their ability to proliferate after 1 to
2 months without AR mutation. As the sequential changes
of the xenograft resemble the clinical behavior of prostate
cancer, this model may provide an excellent system to

EP4 and Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer

study the mechanisms associated with castration-resistant
progression of prostate cancer and to evaluate new treatment modalities for CRPC.
In KUCaP-2, prostaglandin E receptor EP4 subtype (EP4)
expression significantly increased with the development of
castration resistance. We explored the function of EP4 in
prostate cancer cells as a potential target for the treatment
of CRPC.

Materials and Methods
Generation of xenograft model. Clinical materials were
used after informed consent was obtained, according to protocols approved by the institutional review board at Kyoto
University Hospital. All experiments involving laboratory animals were done in accordance with the Guideline for Animal
Experiments of Kyoto University. Local recurrent tumors after radical prostatectomy were resected trans-urethrally,
minced into 20 to 30 mm3 tumor bits, and transplanted s.c.
into 5-wk-old male nude mice (Charles River Japan) with
50 μL of Matrigel (Becton Dickinson) injected around the implant. The KUCaP-2 xenograft was established ∼10 mo after
the first inoculation. The xenograft tumors were extracted
and transplanted to several mice without Matrigel. Ninety
percent of the tumor was serially transplantable.
Sequence analysis. Genomic DNA from the xenograft tissue was extracted and all of the exons of the AR gene were
sequenced as previously reported (3).
Tissue sampling and DNA microarray analysis. The
mice bearing KUCaP-2 tumors were castrated and the sequential changes in tumor volume were analyzed as previously reported (3). Serum samples were obtained at sacrifice
to measure prostate-specific antigen (PSA) values. Xenograft
tissues of KUCaP-2 were collected during various stages and
total RNA was isolated and purified using the RNeasy Mini
Kit (Qiagen). Changes in gene expression were analyzed using
DNA microarray analysis with an Affymetrix Human Genome
U133 Plus2.0.
Real-time PCR. cDNA was synthesized from total RNA using a First-Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (Amersham Pharmacia
Biotech). Real-time PCR was performed using SYBR green
PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems) and monitored using
GeneAmp 5700 (Applied Biosystems) in triplicate. The thermal cycling conditions were 95°C for 15 s, 60°C for 30 s, and
72°C for 30 s. The values were normalized to the levels of amplified glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH).
The sequences of primers were as follows: EP4, 5′-GGAAATGACCAGGCCAAGAC-3′ (sense) and 5′-CAACCCTGGACCTCACACCTA-3′ (antisense); PSA, 5′-GGAAATGACCA‐
GGCCAAGAC-3′ (sense) and 5′-CAACCCTGGACCTCACACCTA-3′ (antisense); AR, 5′-CTTCACCAATGTCAACTCCA-3′
(sense) and 5′-TCATTCGGACACACTGGCTG-3′ (antisense);
and GAPDH, 5′-GAATATAATCCCAAGCGGTTTG-3′ (sense)
and 5′-ACTTCACATCACAGCTCCCC-3′ (antisense).
Antibodies and reagents. Anti-AR (C-19: sc-815) and antiPSA (C-19: sc7638) antibodies were obtained from Santa Cruz
Biotechnology. Anti–β-actin antibody (AC-15: ab6276) was
purchased from Abcam. Anti-EP4 antibody (COOH terminus:

www.aacrjournals.org

101775) for Western blotting was obtained from Cayman
Chemical and anti-EP4 antibody (N terminus: LS-A3898) for
immunohistochemistry was obtained from MBL International. The EP4-specific antagonist ONO-AE3-208 was provided
by Ono Pharmaceutical Co. (5). 5α-Dihydrotestosterone
was purchased from Sigma. Forskolin, an activator of adenylate cyclase, and dibutyryl cyclic AMP (dbcAMP), a cAMP
analogue, were purchased from Nacalai Tesque. H-89,
a cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) inhibitor, was
obtained from Biomol International. An expression vector,
pcDNA3.1-EP4, was constructed by inserting the cDNA of
human EP4, digested from a cloning vector, pBluescriptEP4 (6), into HindIII-BamHI sites of pcDNA3.1(−). Vectors
were transfected into the cells using Lipofectamine 2000
reagent (Invitrogen) and transfectants were selected by
geneticin (Nacalai Tesque).
Western blotting and immunohistochemistry. Western
blotting was performed with each primary antibody (AR,
1:400; PSA, 1:400; EP4 1:700; β-actin, 1:5,000) as previously
reported (7). Immunohistochemistry was performed by
standard indirect immunoperoxidase procedures using
each primary antibody (AR, 1:100; PSA, 1:100; EP4 1:400),
and the reaction was enhanced by microwave only in
EP4 immunohistochemistry. Hormone-naïve prostate cancer (HNPC) tissues were derived from radical prostatectomy specimens of localized prostate cancer patients as
tissue microarrays constructed as previously reported (8,
9). CRPC tissue samples were local tumors obtained from
patients undergoing transurethral resection or autopsy.
The expression intensity was graded as none, weak, moderate, and strong by a clinical pathologist (Y.M.) who was
blind to the clinicopathologic data. The grading was determined based on the intensity of staining for at least 20%
of the cancer cells.
Cell culture. The prostate cancer cell lines LNCaP, DU145,
and PC3 were obtained from the American Type Culture
Collection, passaged for fewer than 6 mo after resuscitation.
The cells were routinely cultured in RPMI 1640 (Invitrogen)
supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. For androgendepleted conditions, cells were cultured in phenol red–free
RPMI 1640 (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% charcoalstripped fetal bovine serum (CSFBS; Hyclone). To analyze
the cell proliferation in vitro, 1.0 × 105 cells per well were
seeded into six-well plates and grown for indicated days,
and then cell numbers were counted in triplicate by a hemocytometer. For the assessment of in vivo tumor growth, 0.5 ×
107 to 1.0 × 107 cells were inoculated with 100 μL Matrigel
in the flank region of 5-wk-old male nude mice, and tumor
volumes were measured once weekly.
RNA interference. AR knockdown was performed using
stealth RNAi [stAR(1);HSS100620 and stAR(2);HSS100619]
compared with control nonspecific stealth RNAi (stCtr;12935400) purchased from Invitrogen. Cells were seeded at 5.0 × 105
per well in six-well plates and incubated for 24 h. Each 160 pmol
of stealth RNAi was transfected using Lipofectamine 2000
reagent.
Luciferase assay. Cells were seeded at 1.5 × 105 per well in
24-well plates and were transiently cotransfected with 250 ng

of pcDNA3.1-EP4, 250 ng of pGL3-PSAp-Luc, and 5 ng of
pTK-RL using Lipofectamine 2000 reagent. After 24 h of incubation, the medium was changed to create androgendepleted conditions and the cells were incubated again for
24 h. The luciferase activity of the cell lysate was measured
using the Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay System (Promega)
with a luminometer (MicroLumat Plus LB96V, Berthold
Technologies) in triplicate.
cAMP assay. Cells were seeded at 1.0 × 105 per well in 96well plates and incubated for 24 h. Cells were washed once
with PBS and cultured for 1 h in androgen-depleted conditions. The intracellular cAMP concentrations were assayed
using the cAMP-EIA kit (RPN225; Amersham-Pharmacia Biotech) in duplicate. ONO-AE3-208 was added 10 min before
the assay.
Statistical analysis. The data were expressed as mean ±
SD and their statistically significant differences were determined by one-way ANOVA. Age, serum PSA levels, Gleason
sums, and tumor volumes were compared by the MannWhitney U test, and EP4 staining levels were compared by
the χ2 test. Statistical analyses were all performed using
SPSS software.

Results
KUCaP-2 is an androgen-dependent prostate cancer xenograft harboring wild-type AR, producing PSA, and developing castration resistance without AR mutation. Tumor
tissues used for the establishment of KUCaP-2 were histologically diagnosed as prostate cancer based on positive AR and
PSA immunohistochemistry staining (Fig. 1A). Western blotting analysis revealed that KUCaP-2 cells expressed AR and
PSA (Fig. 1B). In mice, the KUCaP-2 tumor regressed soon
after castration and reproducibly regrew after 1 to 2 months.
Sequence analysis of AR in KUCaP-2 tumors before and after
castration showed no AR mutation.
Xenograft tissues of KUCaP-2 were transplanted into 12
mice and collected during androgen-dependent growth
(AD), castration-induced regression nadir (ND), and castration-resistant regrowth (CR) stages (n = 4, each; Fig. 1C).
The tumor volumes were 3,012 ± 467, 562 ± 208, and 1,962
± 560 mm3, and the median PSA values of the mice were
166.0, 4.0, and 50.9 ng/mL for the AD, ND, and CR stages, respectively. There was no histologic difference among KUCaP2 tumors of each stage (Fig. 1D, a–c). The nuclear expression
levels decreased from the AD stage to the ND stage, indicating that the depletion of circulating androgen suppressed nuclear expression of AR in KUCaP-2 tumors at the ND stage.
Nuclear expression recovered at the CR stage to levels similar
to those at the AD stage (Fig. 1D, d–f).
EP4 expression was upregulated with the progression of
castration resistance in KUCaP-2 tumors. To elucidate the
mechanisms responsible for the development of castration
resistance, we evaluated the gene expression profiles of tumors at each stage using DNA microarray analyses. In total,
for 2,476 genes, there was a significant difference (P < 0.05) in
expression between at least two stages. The k-means clustering (k = 10) of these genes was performed to select candidate

1608

genes (Fig. 2A). Previous reports on DNA microarray analysis
in several different xenograft models showed that AR was the
only gene consistently upregulated during castration-resistant progression (10). In our study, AR expression slightly increased from the AD stage to the ND stage (ratio = 2.7, P =
0.006), with no difference between the ND and CR stages (ratio = 1.1, P = 0.280). The PSA expression of tumors slightly
and not significantly decreased from the AD stage to the
ND stage (ratio = 0.6, P = 0.138) and recovered at the CR
stage. To find genes associated with castration resistance,
we explored genes in the cluster whose expression levels
were low in both the AD and ND stages but high in the CR
stage. Among 111 genes in this cluster, the CR/ND ratio of
EP4 expression was the highest (ratio = 15.7, P = 0.029; Table
1). These results were validated by real-time PCR analysis
(Fig. 2B). Moreover, EP4 expression was higher in the androgen-independent cell lines (DU145, PC3) compared with an
androgen-dependent cell line (LNCaP; data not shown), consistent to other reports (11–13).
EP4 expression was higher in clinical CRPC than in
HNPC. EP4 was mainly expressed in cellular membranes
or in the cytoplasm of KUCaP-2 tumor cells, with more
expression at the CR stage compared with the AD stage
(Fig. 2C, a,b). Using KUCaP-2 samples from CR and AD
stages as positive and negative controls, respectively, staining intensity of EP4 in clinical materials from 27 HNPC
and 31 CRPC patients was graded (Fig. 2C, c–f). The characteristics of these patients were shown in Table 2. All the
CRPC patients had PSA relapse. The serum PSA level and
the Gleason sum were higher in CRPC than in HNPC. The
EP4 expression level was significantly higher in CRPC than
in HNPC (P = 0.0001).
EP4 overexpression induced castration-resistant
progression of LNCaP cells through AR activation. We
examined whether EP4 overexpression induced castrationresistant progression using LNCaP. LNCaP cells were stably
transfected with pcDNA3.1-EP4, and two monoclonal EP4overexpressing LNCaP clones were established and named
LNCaP-EP4(A) and LNCaP-EP4(B). The EP4 signal activates
adenylate cyclase, which results in acceleration of the production of cAMP (14). The intracellular cAMP concentrations, PSA expression levels, and cell proliferation ratio of
LNCaP-EP4 without androgen were higher compared with
those in vector alone–transfected LNCaP (LNCaP-mock)
cells, indicating that overexpressed EP4 protein activated
adenylate cyclase and induced PSA expression and cell
proliferation without androgen (Fig. 3A).
To examine whether AR activation is associated with androgen-independent PSA expression and cell proliferation in
LNCaP-EP4, AR expression was attenuated using a stealth
RNAi system. PSA expression without androgen was suppressed more significantly by the attenuation of AR in
LNCaP-EP4 cells than in LNCaP-mock cells. Further, the
suppression of androgen-independent cell proliferation was
statistically significant in LNCaP-EP4 cells, but not in
LNCaP-mock cells, indicating that AR activation was associated with androgen independence of LNCaP-EP4 cells
(Fig. 3B). We examined the effect of EP4 on AR activation using

a luciferase reporter assay in LNCaP cells. EP4 signaling promoted AR activation without androgen to ∼50% of the level
achieved with androgen stimulation and did not induce additional AR activation in the presence of androgen. Then, we examined whether the increase in cAMP levels and the
acceleration of PKA activity was associated with AR activation.
PSA expression in LNCaP cells without androgen was induced
by both forskolin and dbcAMP but was inhibited by H-89
(Fig. 3C). These results indicate that the signal activation
of EP4-cAMP-PKA-AR axis is associated with the castration
resistance of LNCaP cells.
The castration of mice decelerated xenograft tumor
growth in LNCaP-mock cells but not in LNCaP-EP4 cells
(Fig. 3D). The serum PSA values of castrated mice bearing
LNCaP-EP4 xenografts were significantly higher than those
of mice bearing LNCaP-mock xenografts (median PSA at sacrifice: 4.0 and 32.5 ng/mL in LNCaP-mock and LNCaP-EP4
cells, respectively, P < 0.05). These results show that EP4

overexpression induces castration-resistant progression of
LNCaP cells in vivo.
EP4 antagonist suppressed castration-resistant progression of LNCaP-EP4 and KUCaP-2 tumors. ONO-AE3-208 is
an EP4-specific antagonist (5). The Ki values of ONO-AE3-208
for the prostanoid receptors are 1.3, 30, 790, and 2,400 nmol/L
for EP4, EP3, FP, and TP, respectively, and >10,000 nmol/L
for the other prostanoid receptors (15). To examine the EP4
antagonistic effect of ONO-AE3-208 on LNCaP-EP4 cells, intracellular cAMP concentrations were examined under a variety
of ONO-AE3-208 concentrations in androgen-depleted conditions, indicating that 10 to 100 nmol/L of ONO-AE3-208 is sufficient to antagonize overexpressed EP4. This concentration
of ONO-AE3-208 reached the Ki of EP3 and could also antagonize EP3. The EP3 signal inhibits adenylate cyclase, and thus
the antagonism of EP3 increases intracellular cAMP concentrations (15). However, the suppression level of cAMP was
proportional to the ONO-AE3-208 concentrations, suggesting

that antagonistic effect against EP3 might be slight. The PSA
expression of LNCaP-EP4 cells without androgen was also
suppressed by the same concentrations of ONO-AE3-208
(Fig. 4A).
We then examined the in vivo antitumor effect of ONOAE3-208. I.p. injection of ONO-AE3-208 (10 mg/kg; once a
day) suppressed the castration-resistant growth of LNCaPEP4 xenograft tumors (Fig. 4B). The serum PSA values of
LNCaP-EP4 xenograft mice were also significantly decreased
(median PSA at sacrifice: 5.7 and 3.7 ng/mL in controls and
AE3-208, respectively, P < 0.05). The mean body weight of
mice in the control and AE3-208 groups were almost the
same, and no mice died during the treatment, indicating that
ONO-AE3-208 was well tolerated at the concentrations used.
The same dose of ONO-AE3-208 also suppressed the castration-resistant growth of KUCaP-2 tumors (Fig. 4C). The PSA
production of KUCaP-2 tumors was significantly decreased
(median PSA at sacrifice: 17.4 and 9.4 ng/mL in controls
and AE3-208, respectively, P < 0.05). There were no significant
differences in EP4 expression between the tumors of the control and AE3-208 groups (data not shown), indicating that

ONO-AE3-208 antagonized EP4 without suppressing the
receptor expression. In summary, EP4 antagonism with
ONO-AE3-208 might be an effective and tolerable treatment
modality for CRPC, in which EP4 overexpression induced
castration-resistant progression (Fig. 4D).

Discussion
As CRPC is a heterogeneous group of diseases (16), many
experimental models are required to elucidate the mechanisms for castration resistance. However, limited tissue availability for molecular studies and few available human
prostate cancer cell lines with both AR- and androgen-dependent states have restricted prostate cancer research. Xenografts are models in which human tissue is transplanted
into an immunodeficient mouse. In this way, human prostate
cancer can be propagated in vivo for long periods to allow the
study of tumor progression under different experimental hormonal conditions and to support the testing of novel therapies. Before 1993, only one prostate cancer xenograft, LNCaP

(17), had been reported to be androgen dependent. LNCaP
tumors shrink slightly after castration, usually with less than
a 10% reduction in volume, and regrow less than 5 weeks after castration. Thereafter, several androgen-dependent xenografts have also been established. The LAPC-4 (18), LuCaP-23
(19), and PC346P (20) xenograft models reportedly show a
response to castration similar to that of LNCaP. The
CWR22 (21) and LAPC-9 (22) models showed recurrent
growth after androgen ablation after 3 to 6 months, which
was similar to our established xenograft, KUCaP-2. Similar
to these models that mimic the clinical behavior of prostate
cancer, KUCaP-2 may provide an excellent system to study
the mechanisms associated with the castration-resistant progression of prostate cancer and help us develop novel treatment modalities against CRPC.
Most androgen-dependent xenografts were derived from
patients with CRPC, as seen in KUCaP-2, because of the difficulty to obtain enough samples from patients with HNPC. It
was suggested that prostate cancer contain a heterogeneous
mixture of cells that vary in their dependence on androgen
for growth and survival, and that treatment with androgen

ablation therapy provides selective pressure and alters the
relative concentration of these cells, thereby leading to the
outgrowth of CRPC (22). These tumors presumably contain
a mixture of growth-arrested, androgen-responsive tumor
cells in addition to androgen-independent cells at the time
of implantation into mice. In the androgenic environment
of the intact male mouse, the androgen-responsive cells
would gain a growth advantage and eventually develop into
androgen-dependent xenografts.
The castration-resistant KUCaP-2 tumors expressed AR in
their nuclei and produced PSA, suggesting that AR was activated with significantly low circulating androgen and is associated with the castration-resistant progression. Recent
findings suggest that AR is an important transcription factor
that mediates survival and proliferation signaling not only in
HNPC but also in CRPC (23, 24). The androgen-independent
activation of AR is mediated by several pathways (25, 26). The
acquisition of mutations in AR is likely to be an important
pathway (3, 27). However, KUCaP-2 harbors wild-type AR
and progresses to castration resistance without AR mutation.
Another possible pathway is its hypersensitivity to low levels

of androgens, induced by increased expression of the AR itself (10). In KUCaP-2, the AR mRNA expression slightly increased from the AD to ND and CR stages. However, the
AR protein expression levels decreased at the ND stage and
recovered at the CR stage to the same level as the AD stage
both in the AR immunohistochemistry (Fig. 1D) and Western
blotting (data not shown) analysis. One possible explanation
for this discrepancy is that the AR protein might be degraded
without androgen at ND stage and stabilized at the CR stage
(28, 29). These results indicated that the upregulation of AR
might merely be an adaptation of tumor cells to the condition of low androgen stimulation and not an essential indicator of castration-resistant progression. EP4 upregulation
was observed during castration-resistant progression in
KUCaP-2. EP4 expression was higher in clinical CRPC than

in HNPC. The xenograft of EP4-overexpressing LNCaP cells
developed castration resistance through AR activation. These
results revealed that EP4 upregulation might lead to AR
activation, resulting in the castration-resistant progression
of prostate cancer. It was reported that the activation of a
membrane-localized G protein-coupled receptor induced
nuclear partition and activation of AR through the accumulation of intracellular cAMP and PKA activation (30). As
EP4 is a G protein-coupled receptor, our data showing that
EP4-cAMP-PKA axis activates AR are consistent to the report.
EP4 is one of the prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) receptors. PGE2,
the product of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) conversion of plasma membrane phospholipids, is the most common prostanoid and is associated with inflammatory disease (14) and
cancer (31, 32). It was suggested that inflammation plays a

EP4 and Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer

role in prostate carcinogenesis (33, 34) and the regular consumption of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID)
may reduce the risk of prostate cancer (35–37). Therefore,
NSAIDs, including COX-2 inhibitors, have been tested in
the treatment (38) and prevention (39) of prostate cancer.
However, these approaches have met with limited success
(40) and, sometimes, severe cardiovascular side effects (41),
probably because COX-2 produces multiple products with
pleiotropic effects in addition to PGE2. Therefore, targeting
downstream signaling pathways of PGE2 may represent an
attractive new strategy. There are four subtypes of PGE2 receptors, EP1 to EP4. The intracellular signaling differs among
the receptor subtypes; EP1 is coupled to calcium mobilization, EP3 inhibits adenylate cyclase, and EP2 and EP4 stim-

ulate adenylate cyclase in various types of cells (42). The
effects of PGE2 are dependent on the ligand concentration
and the target cell receptor expression (32). Experimental
studies have suggested that increased EP2 and EP4 expression is important during colorectal and prostate cancer progression (43, 44). In KUCaP-2, EP2 expression did not increase
significantly during castration-resistant progression (data
not shown), indicating that EP4 might be more strongly associated with castration resistance than EP2 in this model.
To examine the association of PGE2 and cancer progression,
the serum PGE2 concentrations of mice bearing KUCaP-2
were examined by PGE2 Express EIA kit (500141; Cayman
Chemical). Unfortunately, reproducible results could not
be obtained, probably because of the instability of PGE2.

Therefore, it might be difficult to examine the serum PGE2
concentrations in clinical samples. The secreted PGE2 concentrations in LNCaP-EP4 cells were higher than in LNCaPmock cells [20.3 ± 15.4, 48.7 ± 4.9, and 44.7 ± 11.5 pg/mL in
LNCaP-mock, LNCaP-EP4(A), and LNCaP-EP4(B), respectively]. However, the administration of PGE2 into LNCaPEP4 could not induce cell proliferation and PSA production.
To elucidate the association of PGE2 and cancer progression
needs further examinations.
The cell proliferation of LNCaP-EP4 was significantly
higher than that of LNCaP-mock under androgen-depleted
medium but not under normal medium (data not shown),
indicating that EP4 overexpression enhanced androgenindependent but not androgen-dependent proliferation of
LNCaP cells in vitro. However, the in vivo tumor growth
of LNCaP-EP4 was significantly higher than that of
LNCaP-mock in intact mice (193 ± 76 and 121 ± 46 mm3
on day 30, respectively, P = 0.003). Moreover, the xenograft
tumor take-up rate of LNCaP-EP4 was higher than that
of LNCaP-mock (∼100% and 60%, respectively). It was reported that PGE2 regulated angiogenesis in PC3 cells
through EP2 and EP4 (44). Therefore, it was suggested that
EP4 overexpression might increase cell proliferation of
LNCaP cells in vivo through angiogenesis. The PSA expression of LNCaP-EP4 was significantly higher than that of
LNCaP-mock under androgen-depleted medium. Although
EP4 expression was higher in LNCaP-EP4(B) than in
LNCaP-EP4(A), the intracellular cAMP concentration and
PSA expression levels were higher in LNCaP-EP4(A) than
in LNCaP-EP4(B). To investigate the reasons for the discrepancy, we performed transient transfection analyses with
several different amounts of pcDNA3.1-EP4. The PSA expression levels were correlated with EP4 expression levels
in LNCaP cells transiently transfected with the EP4 expression vector, suggesting that the reasons for this discrepancy
might be clonal variations of LNCaP-EP4 (data not shown).
The expression of TMPRSS2, one of other AR-regulated
genes (45), was also increased with EP4 overexpression
and decreased by the attenuation of AR (data not shown).
These results indicated that EP4 may increase PSA expression partly in an AR-dependent manner; however, we do
not exclude possibilities that EP4 increases PSA and

TMPRSS2 expressions through an AR-independent manner.
Analysis of these mechanisms needs further investigations.
It was suggested that the EP4-cAMP-PKA axis can activate
the β-catenin/TCF signaling pathway, leading to cancer
progression (46), and that the EP4-specific antagonist,
ONO-AE3-208, inhibits the progression of EP4-expressing colorectal cancer (47, 48). The present study is the first report
showing that ONO-AE3-208 reduces the castration-resistant
progression of prostate cancer cells induced by EP4 overexpression. ONO-AE3-208 did not suppress the proliferation
of KUCaP-2 in intact mice (data not shown), suggesting that
EP4 antagonism might have no antitumor effect against
HNPC. DU145 and PC3 are AR-negative prostate cancer cells
with high EP4 expression. The in vitro administration of
100 nmol/L ONO-AE3-208 decreased intracellular cAMP concentrations of these cells. However, it did not suppress their
cell proliferation in vitro and in vivo (data not shown). It was
suggested that the EP4-cAMP-PKA axis might not be associated with their cell proliferation.
In conclusion, we found that EP4 overexpression is one of
the mechanisms responsible for progression to CRPC using a
novel xenograft model KUCaP-2. The administration of EP4
antagonist in vivo suppressed the castration-resistant progression of KUCaP-2, indicating that EP4 may be a potential
target for the treatment of CRPC.
