Abstract
Inhibiting angiogenesis has become a major therapeutic
strategy for cancer treatment. To identify common intracellular mediators, we previously analyzed gene expression
profiles of endothelial cells after treatment with angiogenesis
inhibitors. Filamin A interacting protein 1-like (FILIP1L;
previously known as down-regulated in ovarian cancer 1) was
identified as one of the genes up-regulated in endothelial cells
in response to these inhibitors. However, the expression and
function of FILIP1L protein is uncharacterized. Here, we
provide the first description of the expression and specific
subcellular localization of FILIP1L protein in human tissue.
Overexpression of FILIP1L resulted in inhibition of cell
proliferation and migration and increased apoptosis. In
addition, overexpression of FILIP1L truncation mutants
showed differential antiproliferative activity. A COOH terminal truncation mutant (FILIP1L#C103) was more potent than
wild-type FILIP1L in mediating this activity. Targeted expression of FILIP1L#C103 in tumor vasculature inhibited tumor
growth in vivo. Overall, these findings suggest that the novel
protein FILIP1L may be an important mediator of the effects
of angiogenesis inhibitors and that FILIP1L has the potential
to be an antivascular reagent for cancer therapy. [Cancer Res

Introduction
Angiogenesis, the formation of new blood vessels from preexisting ones, is required for the sustained growth, invasion, and
spread of tumors. Thus, the inhibition of tumor angiogenesis has
been considered to be an important component of anticancer
therapy. Many angiogenesis inhibitors that prevent endothelial
cells from proliferating and migrating or result in the induction of
apoptosis have been identified (1, 2). Endostatin, the 20-kDa COOH
terminal fragment of collagen XVIII, inhibits endothelial cell
proliferation, migration, invasion, and tube formation and induces
apoptosis (3–6). Fumagillin, a natural metabolite from Aspergillus
fumigatus, induces cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in endothelial
cells (7–9). EMAP-II, a 20-kDa fragment of the aminoacyl-tRNA
synthetase complex, induces endothelial cell apoptosis, inhibits

endothelial cell proliferation, and up-regulates tissue factor
expression on the endothelial cell surface (10–14). Previously, our
laboratory examined the effects of these different angiogenesis
inhibitors, endostatin, fumagillin, and EMAP-II, on the gene
expression profiles of human umbilical vascular endothelial cells
(HUVEC) to elucidate commonly affected pathways (15, 16).
Interestingly, the majority of gene expression changes were
observed as early as 1 and 2 hours after treatment. Among these,
expression of genes, such as filamin A interacting protein 1-like
[FILIP1L; synonym of down-regulated in ovarian cancer 1 (DOC1),
National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) accession
number NP_055705], KLF4, and TC-1 was shown to be rapidly upregulated. Using small interfering RNA, we showed that, when
FILIP1L was silenced, KLF4 and TC-1 failed to show up-regulation
in gene expression in response to endostatin treatment, suggesting
that FILIP1L may be upstream of KLF4 and TC-1 in a pathway that
mediates the antiangiogenic response to endostatin (15). Likewise,
silencing of FILIP1L gene expression resulted in abrogation of the
modulatory effect of EMAP II on ADM, KLF4, SOCS3, and TNFAIP3
gene expression (16). Collectively, these data suggest that the
FILIP1L gene may play a central role in mediating the common
early response pathways seen in endothelial cells after exposure to
angiogenesis inhibitors.
In the present study, we define expression and specific
subcellular localization of FILIP1L protein in human tissue for
the first time. Additionally, we show that overexpression of FILIP1L
in endothelial cells results in a similar profile of antiangiogenic
activity as the angiogenesis inhibitors. Finally, using a tumor
vascular targeted gene therapy vector, we show that targeted
expression of FILIP1L in the tumor vasculature results in inhibition
of tumor growth in vivo, suggesting that FILIP1L could be
developed as a potential cancer therapeutic.

Materials and Methods
Production of mouse monoclonal anti-FILIP1L antibody. The
construct encoding a full-length FILIP1L cDNA was generated and
expressed in baculovirus. The purified full-length FILIP1L protein (893
amino acids) was used as an antigen to immunize mice. Immunization of
mice, production of hybridoma cells, screening by ELISA, and purification of
monoclonal antibody were performed by Green Mountain Antibodies, Inc.
Antibodies that recognize FILIP1L were further tested by Western blot, and
a monoclonal antibody was selected.
Cell culture. HUVECs were cultured in complete EGM-2 medium as
recommended by the manufacturer (Lonza). HEK293 cells were grown in
DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). DU145 human prostate
carcinoma cells and M21 human melanoma cells were grown in RPMI 1640
containing 10% FBS.
Western blot. HUVECs were cultured, harvested, and fractionated
with ProteoExtract Subcellular Proteome Extraction kit according to the

Functional Characterization of FILIP1L

Figure 1. Expression of FILIP1L protein in HUVECs and human tissue. A, a 110-kDa FILIP1L protein was detected in the cytoplasm, membrane, and nucleus of
HUVECs by Western blot using anti-FILIP1L antibody. A purified FILIP1L protein was used as a standard. B, immunohistochemical staining of FILIP1L and CD31
in human colon cancers and matched normal tissues. H&E staining is also shown. FILIP1L was expressed in the vasculature (!) and muscularis mucosa (J) of
normal human colon tissues. FILIP1L was also expressed in tumor stroma and vasculature (!) of colon cancer tissues. Note that stroma was negative in FILIP1L
staining in normal colon, whereas tumor stroma showed a strong positive staining.

manufacturer’s protocol (Calbiochem). For endostatin experiment, HUVECs
were starved in EGM-2 basal medium containing 1% FBS for 16 h, treated
with 1 Ag/mL endostatin for 2, 4, and 8 h, and lysed with radioimmunoprecipitation assay (RIPA) buffer. HEK293 cells were transfected
using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen), with a series of NH2 terminal and
COOH terminal truncation mutants of FILIP1L containing a COOH terminal
hemagglutinin (HA) tag, harvested at 24 h and lysed with RIPA buffer.
Empty lentivirus or lentivirus expressing FILIP1L mutant 1-790 (hereafter
called FILIP1LDC103)–transduced DU145 clones were cultured in the
presence or absence of 1 Ag/mL doxycycline and lysed with RIPA buffer.
Tumors from PBS-treated, null–adeno-associated virus-phage (hereafter
called AAVP-null)–treated, and AAVP expressing FILIP1LDC103 (hereafter
called AAVP-DC103)–treated mice were removed 4 d after tail vein injection
and snap frozen. Whole tumor lysates were prepared from RIPA buffer lysis
of 60-Am tumor section. Cellular fractionation (25–50 Ag), whole cell lysates,
or whole tumor lysates prepared by above methods were separated on SDSPAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane. The membranes were
blotted with antibodies against FILIP1L, HA tag (Covance), and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH; Chemicon) followed by
incubation with antimouse antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase.
The signal was detected using chemiluminescence (Millipore).
Immunohistochemistry. Frozen human colon tumors and their adjacent
normal colon samples were obtained under an Institutional Review Board–
approved protocol. Tissue sections (10 Am) were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min and stained with mouse monoclonal antibodies against
FILIP1L (7.5 Ag/mL) and CD31 (10 Ag/mL; DAKO). After visualization of
staining by 3,3¶-diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride, the slides were
counterstained with hematoxylin. Images were acquired by Axioplan 2
microscope using a 20/0.75 objective with Axiovision 4.1 software (Zeiss).
Immunofluorescence and vessel density determination. HUVECs
were starved in EGM-2 basal medium containing 1% FBS for 16 h and
treated with 1 Ag/mL endostatin for 4 h. The cells were fixed with 4%
paraformaldehyde for 10 min followed by permeabilization with 0.1% Triton
X-100 for 5 min. The cells were washed with PBS, blocked with 5% bovine

serum albumin (BSA) in PBS, and treated with mouse anti-FILIP1L antibody
(4 Ag/mL) preincubated with 500-fold molar excess of either BSA or
FILIP1L. The cells were then incubated with 2 Ag/mL Alexa Fluor 488
antimouse IgG (Invitrogen) and treated with 4¶,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole
(DAPI) mounting media (Vector Laboratories). Images were acquired on an
LSM-510 confocal microscope using a 25/0.8, 40/1.3, or 63/1.4
objective and analyzed by AxioVision LE software (Zeiss). For AAVPtargeting experiment, tumors from PBS-treated, AAVP-DC103–treated, and
AAVP-DC243–treated mice were removed at 30 min and 6 d after tail vein
injection (30 min only for PBS-treated tumor), snap frozen, and cut into
10-Am tumor sections. These tumor sections were subjected to immunofluorescent staining as described above, except rabbit anti-AAVP antibody
(Sigma), followed by Alexa Fluor 594 antirabbit IgG (Invitrogen) and rat
anti-CD31 antibody (BD PharMingen), followed by Alexa Fluor 488 antirat
IgG (Invitrogen) were used.
CD31-stained tumor sections from PBS-treated, AAVP-null–treated, and
AAVP-DC103–treated mice were analyzed for vessel density as described
previously (17). Three tumors from each treatment group were analyzed.
Five random fields per tumor were imaged by Axiovert 200M microscope
using a 10/0.3 objective (Zeiss). Axiovision 4.6 software (Zeiss) was used to
quantify CD31-positive vessels. In addition, TUNEL staining was also
performed on these AAVP-treated tumors as recommended by the
manufacturer (Promega Corporation). Images were taken by Axiovert
200M microscope using a 5/0.15 objective (Zeiss).
Transfection of HUVECs with FILIP1L plasmids. Plasmids encoding
wild-type, as well as truncation mutants of FILIP1L, were purified using
Endo-free maxiprep kit (Qiagen). HUVECs were transfected with equimolar
amount of each DNA using HUVEC nucleofector solution and Nucleofector
II machine as provided by the manufacturer (Amaxa). Transfection
efficiency was verified using a plasmid with an enhanced green fluorescent
protein (eGFP) marker (2 Ag), as was calculated by the GFP expression. The
percentage of transfection reached by this method was 50 F 10%. After
transfection, the cells were subjected to proliferation, apoptosis, or
migration assays.

Bromodeoxyuridine ELISA cell proliferation assay. The transfected
HUVECs were plated with 2  104 per well in 96-well culture plates and
incubated for 24 h. Cell proliferation was measured by Cell Proliferation
Biotrak ELISA (GE Healthcare), as recommended by the manufacturer.
Apoptosis assay. The transfected HUVECs were plated with 2.5  104
per well in white-walled 96-well culture plates and incubated for 24 h. Early
apoptosis was determined by the measurement of caspase-3/caspase-7
activity using the caspase-Glo 3/7 Assay (Promega Corporation) following
manufacturer’s instructions. The transfected HUVECs were plated with 2 
106/100-mm culture dishes and incubated for 48 h. Late-stage apoptosis was
determined by the staining of Annexin V–FITC and 7-amino-actinomycin D
(7-AAD) staining using the Annexin V–FITC Apoptosis Detection kit (BD
PharMingen) following manufacturer’s instructions. The stained cells were
subjected to flow cytometric analysis using a FACSCalibur (BD PharMingen)
and analyzed by the CELLQuest program.
Migration assay. The migratory potential of the transfected HUVECs
was assessed by Electric Cell-Substrate Impedance Sensing (ECIS Model
9600, Applied Biophysics, Inc.; refs. 18, 19). Cells (1.1  105) were
inoculated in 8W1E plates in complete EGM-2 medium. The cells were
allowed to completely adhere to the electrodes which produced maximum
and nonvariable readings of impedance. The monolayers were then
wounded (30 s, 4.0 V, 60 kHz) where impedance became a minimum. As
cells migrated to heal the wound, the impedance was recorded at 15 kHz
every 5 s for 10 h in real time. The differences in migration rate were
evaluated by comparison of the slopes of the curves in linear range for
early time points.
DU145 clones transduced with either empty lentivirus or lentivirus
expressing FILIP1LDC103 (7.5  104 cells per chamber) were plated in
the presence or absence of 1 Ag/mL doxycycline in upper chamber.
Migration toward 10% FBS was measured at 15 h by QCM 24-well
colorimetric cell migration assay kit (Chemicon), as recommended by the
manufacturer.
Cloning of FILIP1L and its truncation mutants. Genes for FILIP1L
and its truncation mutants were cloned into Gateway entry clones using
multistep PCR. The subsequent entry clones were sequence verified
throughout the entire cloned region. Entry clones were then subcloned by
Gateway LR recombination using the manufacturer’s protocols (Invitrogen)
into different expression vectors.
Lentivirus generation and development of inducible clones overexpressing FILIP1L#C103. A lentiviral construct encoding FILIP1LDC103
was used to generate lentivirus expressing FILIP1LDC103 by the ViraPower
T-REx Lentiviral Expression System (Invitrogen) using the manufacturer’s
protocols. DU145 cells were transduced with the Tet repressor-lentivirus
and screened for clones that expressed the Tet repressor by Western blot
analysis. Tet repressor-expressing DU145 cells were then transduced with
either empty lentivirus or lentivirus expressing FILIP1LDC103, and stable
clones were screened by real-time reverse transcription–PCR (RT-PCR)
analysis.
Quantitative real-time RT-PCR. DU145 clones transduced with
lentivirus expressing FILIP1LDC103 were cultured in the presence or
absence of 1 Ag/mL doxycycline for 48 h and harvested. Total RNA was
prepared by RNeasy kit (Qiagen), and cDNA was prepared by Superscript II
reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). qPCR was performed using ABI 7500 SDS
real-time PCR instrument following manufacturer’s instructions (Applied
Biosystems). The expression of the FILIP1L gene was normalized to GAPDH
expression. The primers used were 5¶-AACGCTGGTATCATGGCTGAA-3¶
and 5¶-ATCTCTGCACTGCTCCTCCATT-3¶ for FILIP1L; 5¶-TCACCAGGGCTGCTTTTAACTC-3¶ and 5¶-GGAATCATATTGGAACATGTAAACCA-3¶ for GAPDH.
Construction and generation of targeted AAVP particles. Cloning
of both FILIP1LDC103 (amino acid 1-790) and FILIP1LDC243 (amino acid
1-650) mutant cDNA into the AAVP vector and the production of AAVP
was performed as described previously (20, 21).
Xenograft assay. M21 human melanoma cells were injected s.c. into
female athymic nude mice and grown to an average size of 100 mm3. Mice
were randomly sorted into four groups (n = 11 for each group), AAVP (1 
1011 transducing units per dose) was injected i.v. at day 0 and day 7, and

angiogenesis inhibitors (15, 16), the expression of FILIP1L protein
has not been previously investigated. To determine whether
FILIP1L protein is endogenously expressed in human tissue, we
produced monoclonal antibodies that specifically recognize
FILIP1L. To detect FILIP1L protein in endothelial cells and
determine its subcellular localization, HUVECs were fractionized
and a Western blot was performed using anti-FILIP1L antibody. A
specific 110-kDa band, identical size to the purified FILIP1L
protein, was detected by anti-FILIP1L antibody, suggesting that
HUVECs express a full-length FILIP1L protein (Fig. 1A). In addition,
FILIP1L was expressed predominantly in the cytoplasm with less
expression in the membrane and nucleus. Having shown the
expression of FILIP1L protein in cultured endothelial cells, we then
examined the expression of FILIP1L in human tissue. Immunohistochemical analysis was performed on 15 frozen human colon
cancers and matched normal colon tissues using anti-FILIP1L
antibody. In normal colon, FILIP1L was expressed in the
vasculature and muscularis mucosa (Fig. 1B, top). In colon cancer,
FILIP1L was strongly expressed in tumor stroma and the
vasculature (Fig. 1B, bottom). Thus, these data show that FILIP1L
is expressed in vasculature and smooth muscle and in desmoplastic
stroma in response to tumor invasion.
Up-regulation of FILIP1L protein by endostatin. Our
previous studies have shown that FILIP1L mRNA expression is
up-regulated in HUVECs within 1 hour after the treatment of
endothelial cells with the angiogenesis inhibitors endostatin,
fumagillin, and EMAP II (15, 16). To further confirm that FILIP1L
protein expression is up-regulated in endothelial cells in response
to angiogenesis inhibitors, we treated HUVECs with endostatin,
harvested cells at 2, 4, and 8 h, and performed Western blot
analysis using anti-FILIP1L antibody on whole cell lysates.
Compared with vehicle-treated controls, endostatin-treated
HUVECs expressed more FILIP1L protein at all the time points
tested (densitometric quantitation values are also shown in
Fig. 2A). To examine if endostatin treatment affects cellular
distribution of FILIP1L protein in endothelial cells, we first serum
starved HUVECs to synchronize them. We then treated those
HUVECs with endostatin and immunofluorescently stained them
with anti-FILIP1L antibody at 4 h. Serum-starved, vehicle-treated
control cells showed weak cytoplasmic staining, whereas endostatin-treated cells showed a stronger punctate distribution of
staining in the cytoplasm (Fig. 2B; additional images are shown in
Supplementary Fig. S1). FILIP1L expression measured by immunofluorescent staining in endostatin-treated HUVECs was significantly more than that in vehicle-treated control cells (P = 0.0012;
Fig. 2C). In addition, this staining was FILIP1L-specific, as antiFILIP1L antibody preincubated with FILIP1L protein, but not
with BSA control, failed to show the staining (Fig. 2D). These
results suggest that FILIP1L protein expression is increased after
endostatin treatment and support our initial observations at the
mRNA level.
Overexpression of FILIP1L in endothelial cells leads to
inhibition of cell proliferation and an increase in apoptosis.
Because FILIP1L protein expression was up-regulated by the
angiogenesis inhibitor endostatin, we hypothesized that FILIP1L
may mediate antiangiogenic activity in endothelial cells and that
overexpression of FILIP1L in endothelial cells may result in
antiproliferative and proapoptotic activity. To test this, we transfected HUVECs with a plasmid encoding FILIP1L cDNA and
measured cell proliferation by bromodeoxyuridine (BrdUrd) ELISA
24 hours after transfection. Transfection efficiency was 50 F 10%,

as verified by GFP expression after transfection of HUVECs with a
control plasmid encoding an eGFP. Compared with control empty
vector-transfected cells, FILIP1L-transfected cells showed a decrease in cell proliferation (P < 0.0001; Fig. 3A). To determine if
overexpression of FILIP1L in endothelial cells results in an increase
in apoptosis, we measured caspase-3/caspase-7 activity at 24 hours
after transfection of HUVECs with FILIP1L cDNA. Although
caspase-3/caspase-7 activity in control vector-transfected cells
was present due to the cytotoxicity caused by the transfection
procedure, FILIP1L-transfected cells showed significantly more
activity (P < 0.001; Fig. 3B). To further detect apoptosis in these
cells, we stained the transfected cells with Annexin V–FITC and
7-AAD at 48 hours after transfection and measured staining using
flow cytometry. As shown in Fig. 3C, FILIP1L overexpression
resulted in increased staining of both Annexin V–FITC and 7-AAD
(44.4% versus 15.2%), suggesting that late-stage apoptosis is
increased in FILIP1L-transfected cells compared with control
vector-transfected cells.
FILIP1L truncation mutants have differential antiproliferative activity. A coiled-coil region (residues 3-542), two leucine
zipper motifs (residues 83-111 and 218-253), and a prefoldin
domain (residues 465-535) can be recognized in the NH2 terminal
half of the FILIP1L protein. In addition, an NCBI conserved domain
search5 reveals that FILIP1L has an SbcC (COG0419; ATPase
involved in DNA repair; residues 19-576) conserved domain in its
NH2 terminal half and a Herpes_BLLF1 (pfam05109; Herpes virus
major outer envelope glycoprotein; residues 640-829) conserved
domain in its COOH terminal half (Fig. 4A).
To examine which part of the FILIP1L protein mediates the
antiproliferative activity in endothelial cells, we generated a series
of NH2 terminal and COOH terminal truncation mutants of
FILIP1L as a fusion protein containing a COOH terminal HA tag
(Fig. 4B). To determine if these mutant constructs produce proteins
in cells, we transfected HEK293 cells with each construct and
performed Western blot analysis using anti-HA tag antibody. All
the constructs produced proteins of the predicted size, although
NH2 terminal truncation mutants 127-893 and 512-893 showed low
levels of expression (Fig. 4C). To determine if these proteins are
functional, we transfected HUVECs with the plasmid encoding
each FILIP1L mutant and measured cell proliferation by BrdUrd
ELISA 24 hours after transfection. FILIP1L truncation mutants
1-790, 1-650, 1-512, and 127-893 significantly inhibited cell
proliferation compared with control. COOH terminal truncation
mutant 1-790 was more potent in its ability to inhibit cell
proliferation than wild type (P = 0.001; Fig. 4D). Thus, we chose to
further evaluate the function of the COOH terminal truncation
mutant 1-790 (called FILIP1LDC103). To examine if overexpression
of FILIP1LDC103 in endothelial cells results in an increase in
apoptosis, we measured caspase-3/caspase-7 activity at 24 hours
after transfection of HUVECs with FILIP1LDC103 cDNA. As shown
in Supplementary Fig. S2, FILIP1LDC103-transfected cells showed
significantly more apoptotic activity than control cells (P < 0.0001).
Overexpression of FILIP1L#C103 in HUVECs and DU145
prostate cancer cells leads to inhibition of cell migration.
Because inhibition of cell migration is one of the important
characteristics of angiogenesis inhibitors, we tested whether
overexpression of FILIP1LDC103 results in inhibition of cell

5

migration. To do this, we transfected HUVECs with a plasmid
encoding FILIP1LDC103 cDNA and measured cell migration by
Electric Cell-Substrate Impedance Sensing system (Applied Biophysics, Inc.; refs. 18, 19). Compared with control empty vectortransfected cells, FILIP1LDC103-transfected cells showed a significantly slower migration rate (P < 0.0001; Fig. 5A), suggesting that
overexpression of FILIP1LDC103 in HUVECs results in inhibition of
cell migration.
We also tested the effects of overexpression of FILIP1LDC103 on
migration of neoplastic cell lines. We selected DU145 prostate
cancer cells as a model system because FILIP1L mRNA expression
was shown to be repressed in immortalized prostate epithelial cells
(22, 23), and FILIP1L mRNA expression is relatively low in this cell
line compared with other cancer cell lines.6 Overexpression of
FILIP1LDC103 in DU145 cells also resulted in inhibition of cell
proliferation (Supplementary Fig. S3). Thus, we chose to develop
inducible FILIP1LDC103-overexpressing clones. The system we
used was the ViraPower T-REx Lentiviral Expression System
(Invitrogen). In this system, the expression of a gene of interest
is repressed by a Tet repressor in the absence of tetracycline (or
doxycycline), whereas it is derepressed in the presence of
tetracycline (or doxycycline). Clones were screened by real-time
RT-PCR analysis. Several clones showed a 2.5-fold to 7-fold increase
in FILIP1LDC103 mRNA expression after doxycycline induction
compared with the uninduced condition (Fig. 5B). Unexpectedly,
however, we observed that, at the uninduced basal level, most of
these clones expressed 20-fold to 60-fold more FILIP1LDC103
mRNA than parental Tet repressor-expressing DU145 cells (Fig. 5B).
FILIP1LDC103 protein levels were shown to be increased
considerably by doxycycline, but the basal level expression was
also detectable in these clones (Fig. 5C). Control cells that were a
mixed population from empty lentivirus-transduced Tet repressorexpressing DU145, however, did not produce any FILIP1LDC103
protein (Fig. 5C). To measure cell migration for these cells, we used
the Boyden chamber assay. Using this system, we measured cell
migration for the FILIP1LDC103 clones 2, 12, and 13, as well as
control cells. All the FILIP1LDC103 clones, but not control cells,
showed a significantly slower migration in the presence of
doxycycline (P < 0.005; Fig. 5D). Therefore, these data suggest that
overexpression of FILIP1LDC103 in DU145 cells also results in
inhibition of cell migration.
Targeted expression of FILIP1L#C103 in tumor vasculature
results in inhibition of tumor growth in vivo. We have shown
that overexpression of FILIP1L results in inhibition of cell
proliferation and migration and increased apoptosis in vitro. We
then set out to evaluate the effects of targeted FILIP1L expression
in vivo. In particular, we chose to selectively deliver FILIP1L to
tumor vasculature to determine if overexpression of FILIP1L in
tumor vasculature leads to an antitumor effect. To achieve this, we
used a hybrid AAVP vector, which has been shown to specifically
target tumor vasculature in an RGD peptide–restricted manner
(20, 21, 24). These hybrid vectors rely on the specific binding
relationship between an RGD peptide and av integrin expressed on
the surface of tumor vasculature. These vectors have been shown
to specifically traffic to and specifically transfect tumor associated
endothelial cells without evidence of transfection of normal
endothelial cells. We tested two FILIP1L mutants for this purpose:

Functional Characterization of FILIP1L

FILIP1LDC103 (amino acid 1-790) and FILIP1LDC243 (amino acid
1-650). We cloned each FILIP1L mutant cDNA into the AAVP
vector, produced RGD-targeted AAVP, and screened for the AAVP,
which showed the highest expression of each mutant by real-time
RT-PCR analysis.
To examine whether the AAVP specifically targets tumor
vasculature in our M21 human melanoma model, the RGDtargeted AAVP was injected into the tail vein of female athymic
nude mice harboring a 100 to 150 mm3 subcutaneous M21 tumor.
After injection, tumors were harvested by time course and analyzed
by immunofluorescent staining with anti-CD31 and anti-AAVP
antibodies. Both RGD-4C-FILIP1LDC103 AAVP (AAVP expressing
FILIP1L mutant 1-790; called AAVP-DC103) and RGD-4C-FILIP1LDC243 AAVP (AAVP expressing FILIP1L mutant 1-650;
hereafter called AAVP-DC243) were shown to specifically target
tumor vasculature (Fig. 6A; data for AAVP-DC243 shown in
Supplementary Fig. S4), but not tumor cells (Fig. 6A) or the
vasculature of normal organs (Supplementary Fig. S5). We also
measured FILIP1L protein expression in these tumors by Western
blot analysis using anti-FILIP1L antibody on whole tumor lysates.
Tumors from AAVP-DC103–treated mice, but not PBS and RGD-4C
AAVP (control null AAVP; called AAVP-null)–treated mice, showed
FILIP1L protein expression (Fig. 6B). Therefore, these data support
the observation that the FILIP1L mutant is expressed in the tumor
vasculature of mice treated with AAVP-DC103.
To evaluate the efficacy of the FILIP1L mutant-AAVP treatment
on tumor growth inhibition in vivo, M21 melanoma cells were
injected s.c. into female athymic nude mice and grown to an
average size of 100 mm3. Mice were randomly sorted into four
groups (n = 11 for each group), AAVP (1  1011 transducing units
per dose) was injected i.v. at day 0 and day 7, and tumors were
measured in a blinded manner. The following groups were tested:
PBS, AAVP-null, AAVP-DC243, and AAVP-DC103. PBS control
tumors grew aggressively and started to show central necrosis by
day 14. Thus, the experiments were terminated at day 14. Only
tumors from AAVP-DC103–treated mice were significantly smaller
than those from PBS-treated mice by day 14 (P < 0.01; Fig. 6C).
Although tumors from AAVP-null–treated mice and AAVP-DC243–
treated mice were smaller than those from PBS-treated mice, the
differences were not statistically significant. In addition, tumors
from AAVP-DC103–treated mice were significantly smaller than
those from AAVP-null–treated mice (P < 0.05) and AAVP-DC243–
treated mice (P < 0.05) by day 14 (Fig. 6C). These results suggest

that targeted expression of FILIP1LDC103 in tumor vasculature
results in inhibition of M21 melanoma growth in vivo.
To confirm that the inhibition of tumor growth is dependent on
the antivascular effects of FILIP1LDC103, vessel density was
analyzed for these AAVP-treated tumors. The percentage area of

inhibited cell proliferation compared with control (*). COOH terminal mutant
1-790 was more potent than wild-type FILIP1L in mediating antiproliferative
activity (**, P = 0.001). The result is representative of two independent
experiments.

CD31-positive cells was used as a measure of vessel density (17).
Vessel density from AAVP-DC103–treated tumors was significantly
less than those from PBS-treated tumors (P < 0.001) and AAVPnull–treated tumors (P < 0.01) at day 4 (Fig. 6D), suggesting that
the inhibition of tumor vasculature by AAVP-DC103 leads to the
inhibition of M21 tumor growth. In addition, AAVP-DC103–treated
tumors showed extensive apoptosis as measured by TUNEL
staining compared with PBS-treated or AAVP-null–treated tumors
(Supplementary Fig. S6), further suggesting that the inhibition of

tumor vasculature by AAVP-DC103 results in induction of
apoptosis and necrosis in these M21 tumors.

Discussion
The development and maintenance of a blood supply is critical
for the growth, invasion, and metastatic spread of tumors.
Inhibiting the process of new blood vessel formation, as well as
attacking established tumor vasculature, has been shown to be a
viable strategy for treating cancer (25). A number of antiangiogenic agents have been identified, and several have entered
clinical trials.7 To better understand the mechanisms of action of
these agents on endothelial cells and determine if common
pathways are shared between agents, we previously analyzed the
gene expression responses of endothelial cells to a variety of
angiogenesis inhibitors (15, 16). Based on these studies, we
identified FILIP1L (previously termed DOC1) as a potentially
important common regulator of the antiangiogenic activity on
endothelial cells.
In the present study, we characterized the patterns of FILIP1L
expression and elucidated important functions of FILIP1L in
endothelial cells and cancer cells. We have shown that FILIP1L
protein is expressed in the vasculature and muscularis mucosa of
the colon. The same pattern of expression was observed in human
prostate (data not shown). In endothelial cells, endogenous
FILIP1L protein expression is up-regulated by the angiogenesis
inhibitor endostatin, suggesting that FILIP1L may be a downstream
mediator of some of endostatin’s functions, including the inhibition
of cell proliferation and migration and the induction of apoptosis.
Overexpression of FILIP1L in endothelial cells results in inhibition
of cell proliferation and increased apoptosis. The COOH terminal
truncation mutant 1-790 (FILIP1LDC103) is more potent than wildtype FILIP1L in mediating this antiproliferative activity. In
addition, overexpression of FILIP1LDC103 in HUVECs, as well as
DU145 prostate cancer cells, leads to inhibition of cell migration.
Finally, targeted expression of FILIP1LDC103 in tumor-associated
vasculature results in the inhibition of M21 melanoma growth
in vivo, demonstrating a similar effect as that seen by the delivery

by Western blot using anti-FILIP1L antibody. Three different tumors per group were analyzed. GAPDH blot is shown as the loading control. C, tumors from
AAVP-DC103–treated mice (empty circles ) were significantly smaller than those from PBS-treated mice (empty triangles ) in M21 xenograft model at day 14 (P < 0.01).
Tumors from AAVP-DC103–treated mice were also significantly smaller than those from AAVP-null–treated mice (filled triangles ; P < 0.05) and AAVP-DC243–treated
mice (filled circles ; P < 0.05) by day 14. AAVP was injected i.v. at day 0 and day 7 (arrow ). Bars, SE (n = 11). The result is representative of two independent

of angiogenesis inhibitors. Therefore, these data suggest that the
novel protein FILIP1L could be a potential candidate for cancer
therapy by targeted delivery.
Overexpression of FILIP1L in vitro resulted in inhibition of cell
proliferation in other cell types, in addition to endothelial cells.
Normal fibroblasts, as well as some cancer cells, including DU145
prostate carcinoma cells showed inhibition of cell proliferation
after FILIP1L overexpression (Supplementary Fig. S3 and data not
shown). To avoid possible toxicity, we chose to selectively deliver
FILIP1L to tumor vasculature. To achieve this, we used a hybrid
AAVP vector, which has been shown to specifically target tumor
vasculature (21). Systemic delivery of our targeted FILIP1LDC103-

www.aacrjournals.org

expressing AAVP had the greatest effect on tumor growth
inhibition (Fig. 6C).
Limited studies of FILIP1L from other laboratories have
suggested that gene expression of FILIP1L is also implicated in
neoplasia and senescence. FILIP1L mRNA was originally characterized as present in human ovarian epithelial cells, but
consistently absent in ovarian carcinoma cells (26). Using cDNA
microarray analysis, FILIP1L was identified as one of the genes
whose transcription is induced in senescent human prostate
epithelial cells, but significantly repressed in immortalized prostate
epithelial cells (22, 23). In addition, FILIP1L mRNA expression was
shown to be down-regulated in microvascular endothelial cells

infected with Kaposi’s sarcoma-associated herpesvirus compared
with uninfected microvascular endothelial cells (27). Furthermore,
FILIP1L mRNA expression was also shown to be down-regulated
in B cells transformed with an oncogene TaxBLV (bovine leukemia
virus Tax) compared with untransformed B cells (28).
Although we have shown that overexpression of FILIP1L inhibits
cell proliferation and migration, and induces apoptosis, the
physiologic function of FILIP1L remains unclear. FILIP1L has a
striking similarity to FILIP1 (29). There is 46% amino acid identity
between FILIP1L and FILIP1. Both have coiled-coil in NH2 terminal
halves, and FILIP1L has two leucine zipper motifs whereas FILIP1
has four leucine zipper motifs in its NH2 terminal halves. Both have
two isoforms: isoform 2 of FILIP1L (893 amino acids) lacks the 240
amino-terminal residues of isoform 1 (1,135 amino acids) and
S-FILIP1 (965 amino acids) lacks the 247 amino-terminal residues
of L-FILIP1 (1,213 amino acids). Furthermore, FILIP1L is shown to
be expressed in vessels and smooth muscle cells in human colon
tissue (Fig. 1B), and FILIP1 is shown to be expressed in cardiac,
skeletal, and smooth muscle, as well as in the nervous system (29).
In contrast, the FILIP1L gene is located on chromosome 3q12.1,
whereas the FILIP1 gene is located on chromosome 6q14.1. To date,
the human FILIP1L gene is known to have 12 orthologues only in
mammals, in contrast to the human FILIP1 gene which has 30
orthologues throughout many species.
FILIP1 binds to filamin A and induces degradation of
filamentous actin associated filamin A, thereby suppressing cell
motility and formation of lamellipodia (29, 30). In this study, we
have shown that FILIP1L inhibits cell migration (Fig. 5A and D). In
addition, immunofluorescence staining of both FILIP1L (Fig. 2B)
and FILIP1(29) reveals a similar punctate distribution in the
cytoplasm. Interestingly, LL5h, a PIP3 and g-filamin–binding
protein, shows a punctate distribution in the cytoplasm with
colocalization of g-filamin (31). A novel a-helical coiled-coil
domain-containing protein FIP, which is shown to bind Dictyostelium filamin also shows a punctate staining pattern in the cytosol
(32). Therefore, we suspect that FILIP1L might be one of FILIP1
family proteins that have a functional relationship to filamin A.
Filamin A is an actin-binding protein which stabilizes threedimensional actin filaments and links them to cellular membranes

(reviewed in ref. 33). It is essential for cell motility and fetal
development (34–36). Filamin A has been shown to bind a number
of membrane receptors and signal transduction intermediates,
including some regulatory cofactors of the Rho GTPases family
(37–43). Angiogenesis inhibitors, such as endostatin, fumagillin,
and EMAP II, have also been shown to regulate cytoskeletal
organization to inhibit endothelial cell function (44–47). Therefore,
the fact that FILIP1L expression is modulated by these inhibitors
and that overexpression of FILIP1L in endothelial cells mimics the
effects of these inhibitors further suggests that FILIP1L might exert
its functions via the cytoskeleton. For instance, loss of filamin A
was shown to result in not only inhibition of cell migration but also
induction of apoptosis (48–50). Thus, it is possible that FILIP1L
inhibits the function of filamin A after angiogenesis inhibitor
treatment, thereby inhibiting endothelial cell function by the
induction of apoptosis. Future studies to identify the physiologic
binding partner(s) of FILIP1L and examine the potential relationship between FILIP1L and filamin A will be of interest.
In summary, we have characterized FILIP1L as a mediator of
apoptosis and an inhibitor of cell migration and proliferation.
Targeted delivery of the most potent FILIP1L truncation mutant to
tumor vasculature results in tumor growth inhibition in a human
xenograft mouse model. Further characterization of FILIP1L may
lead to an improved understanding of the role played by agents
that affect the cytoskeleton and may lead to the development of
more effective anticancer agents.
