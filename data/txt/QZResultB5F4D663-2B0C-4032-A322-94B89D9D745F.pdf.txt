Abstract
There has been little study of how the evolution of chemoresistance in cancer affects other aspects of disease pathogenesis.
Here, we show that an important chemoresistance axis driven by
cytidine deaminase (CDA) also acts to suppress cell-cycle progression by regulating cyclin E–CDK2 signaling. We found that
CDA was regulated by miR-484 in a gemcitabine-resistant model
of breast cancer. Elevating miR-484 expression reversed the CDA
effects, thereby enhancing gemcitabine sensitivity, accelerating
cell proliferation, and redistributing cell-cycle progression. Conversely, elevating CDA to restore its expression counteracted the

chemosensitization and cell proliferative effects of miR-484. In
clinical specimens of breast cancer, CDA expression was frequently downregulated and inversely correlated with miR-484 expression. Moreover, high expression of CDA was associated with
prolonged disease-free survival in studied cohorts. Collectively,
our ﬁndings established that miR-484–modulated CDA has a
dual impact in promoting chemoresistance and suppressing cell
proliferation in breast cancer, illustrating the pathogenic tradeoffs
associated with the evolution of chemoresistance in this malignant disease. Cancer Res; 75(7); 1504–15. 2015 AACR.

Introduction

therapeutics requires an in-depth understanding of drug resistance, drug metabolism, and personalized drugs to optimize
therapeutic decisions for each patient.
Gemcitabine (20 ,20 -diﬂuorodeoxycytidine, dFdC), which is a
pyrimidine nucleoside analogue of deoxycytidine, is widely
used in chemotherapy for non–small cell lung cancer (4),
pancreatic cancer (5), and ovarian cancer (6). Since 2004,
gemcitabine has been approved by the FDA as a ﬁrst-line
treatment for patients with recurrent or metastatic breast cancer
and for use after the failure of prior anthracycline-containing
adjuvant chemotherapy (7). Gemcitabine enters the cell via a
nucleoside transporter and undergoes stepwise phosphorylation to be converted into active drug metabolites. Inside the
cell, gemcitabine is phosphorylated by various deoxycytidine
kinases and incorporated into DNA strands to inhibit DNA
replication and cell proliferation while promoting apoptosis in
cancer cells (8). More than 90% of administered gemcitabine is
inactivated by cytidine deaminase (CDA), which converts
gemcitabine into 20 -deoxy-20 ,20 -diﬂuorouridine (dFdU; refs. 9,
10). Recent studies have suggested that genes in the gemcitabine metabolic pathway are associated with gemcitabine resistance (11, 12). MicroRNAs are noncoding RNA molecules of
approximately 21 to 25 nucleotides that modulate gene expression by directly interacting with an mRNA target, thus leading
to either degradation of the mRNA transcript or inhibition of
the translation process (13). Evidence indicates that miRNAs
play pivotal roles in chemotherapy resistance (14). Several
studies have revealed that miR-328 is associated with mitoxantrone resistance (15) and that increased miR-221 and miR222 expression is associated with tamoxifen resistance in breast
cancer cells through targeting p27/kip (16). However, the
gemcitabine resistance–relevant network in breast cancer and
their underlying molecular mechanisms have not yet been
elucidated.

Breast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer among
women worldwide (1). Current breast cancer therapy combines
surgery and various adjuvant therapeutic options, including
cytotoxic chemotherapy, hormonal therapy, molecular-targeted
therapy, or a combination of these approaches. However,
acquired resistance to chemotherapy represents a major clinical
obstacle in successful treatment of breast cancer. It is estimated
that 1 of 2 patients with breast cancer fails to respond to initial
treatment or rapidly acquires resistance to chemotherapeutic
agents (2). Moreover, the majority of patients with cancer will
develop aggressive malignancies that exhibit up to 90% resistance toward one or more drugs, even if they show an initial
response to treatment (3). Thus, the development of cancer

miR-484/CDA Axis in Breast Cancer

The primary aim of this study was to explore the molecules
involved in gemcitabine resistance and the corresponding underlying regulatory mechanisms in breast cancer. Here, we found that
CDA functions as a major mediator of gemcitabine resistance
and, more importantly, that CDA acts as a proliferation suppressor and is associated with good outcome in breast cancer.
Moreover, an integrated mRNA–miRNA network suggests that
CDA is a direct target of miR-484, which can reverse CDAmediated chemoresistance and proliferation inhibition. Therefore, our results suggested that miR-484–modulated CDA is an
important chemoresistance regulator with potent tumor-suppressing activity.

Materials and Methods
Cell lines and cell culture
The MCF7, MDA-MB-231 (MDA-231), MDA-MB-436 (MDA436), MDA-MB-468 (MDA-468), ZR-75-30, and Hs-578T human
breast cancer cell lines and the HEK293T cell line were obtained
from the Shanghai Cell Bank Type Culture Collection Committee
(CBTCCC, Shanghai, China) in 2012 and cultured in complete
growth medium as recommended by the distributor. The identities of cell lines were conﬁrmed by CBTCCC using DNA proﬁling
(short tandem repeat, STR). These cell lines were conserved in our
laboratory and subjected to routine cell line quality examinations
(e.g., morphology, mycoplasma) by HD Biosciences every 3
months. The cells for experiments were passaged for less than 6
months. The MDA-231 gemcitabine-resistant subline MDA-231Gem was established according to a previous study (17) by
stepwise selection with increasing concentrations of gemcitabine
(Eli Lilly) with 12 cycles at a range of 12 to 720 nmol/L in the
culture medium (Supplementary Table S1). During each cycle, the
cells were cultured with different gemcitabine concentrations for 1
week until new clones were present, followed by culture with
normal medium for approximately 6 weeks to reach 85%
conﬂuence.
miRNA and mRNA microarrays
The brief details of the miRNA and mRNA microarrays are
described in the Supplementary Methods. These microarray data
have been deposited in the National Center for Biotechnology
Information Gene Expression Omnibus database under the accession number GSE63140.
Quantitative PCR and Western blotting
Total RNA was isolated from cells and tissues using TRIzol
reagent (Invitrogen). Quantitative PCR (qPCR) was performed to
detect selected genes using a SYBR Premix Ex Taq System
(TaKaRa). The primers are listed in Supplementary Table S2.
Mature has-miR-345, has-miR-484, and has-miR-339-5p were
detected with speciﬁc stem loop primers and normalized to U6
small RNA using TaqMan miRNA assays (Applied Biosystems).
All samples were run in triplicate. Western blotting was performed
using a general method, with the following antibodies: antib-actin (Sigma-Aldrich); anti-CDA, anti-phospho-Rb, anti-Rb,
anti-E2F1, anti-cyclin A, anti-cyclin E, and anti-CDK2 (Cell Signaling Technology). The densitometry analysis was performed
using ImageJ software (NIH, Bethesda, MD).
Expression constructs and shRNA constructs
The retroviral expression constructs for HA-FLAG-CDA were
made using MSCV vectors carrying an HA-FLAG tag at the N

terminus as previously described (18). The miR-339-5p, miR-345,
and miR-484 precursor sequences were constructed in lentivirusbased pEZX constructs by GeneCopoeia, Inc. The sequences for
shCDA-1, shCDA-2, and shCDA-3 were 50 -TGAGAGAGTTTGGCACCAA-30 , 50 -CAGTGACATGCAAGATGAT-30 , and 50 -GTGCTGAACGGACCGCTAT-30 , respectively. The lentivirus-based
shRNA constructs were supplied by GeneChem Inc.
Patients and specimens
In this study, we retrospectively obtained 193 pathologically
conﬁrmed primary breast cancer samples and 36 noncancerous
mammary controls to examine the CDA protein level via immunohistochemical (IHC) analysis. In this cohort, patients with
breast cancer were regularly followed, and the clinical outcomes
of 177 cases were obtained, with the last update occurring in
September 2013. We also obtained 30 paired primary breast
tumors and corresponding adjacent non-cancer tissues to examine the relevant mRNAs and microRNAs proﬁles by qPCR analysis. The detailed enrollment criteria for these cohorts are
described in the Supplementary Methods. In addition, a large
public clinical database (Kaplan–Meier plotter) of breast cancer
was used to explore the association between CDA expression and
clinical outcomes (19). This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Fudan University Shanghai Cancer Center,
and all participants provided informed consent to participate in
this research.
Tissue microarray, IHC staining, and IHC variable evaluation
Tissue microarrays (TMA) were constructed using above parafﬁn-embedded blocks of breast tumors and blocks of noncancerous mammary controls. TMAs were composed of duplicate
cores from different areas of the same tumor to compare staining
patterns. IHC analysis was done essentially as described previously (20). A total of 193 cancerous and 36 noncancerous
mammary cases were included in IHC analyses. IHC variables
were scored semiquantitatively according to the approach of a
prior study (21). The brief details of TMAs construction, IHC
staining, and IHC variable evaluation are described in the Supplementary Methods.
Cytotoxicity, cell proliferation, and colony formation assays
and cell-cycle distribution analysis
Cells in the logarithmic growth phase were used for these
assays. The brief details of these assays are described in the
Supplementary Methods.
Luciferase reporter assay targeting CDA 30 -UTR
The brief details of the luciferase reporter assay are described in
the Supplementary Methods.
Statistical analyses
Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS Software version
17.0 (SPSS). ANOVA and the Student t test were used to determine
the statistical signiﬁcance between experimental groups. The
correlations between the clinical–pathologic parameters and
CDA expression levels were tested using the c2 test. Survival
outcomes were estimated using the Kaplan–Meier method and
compared between groups using log-rank test. Univariate Cox
proportional hazard model was used to determine the associations of the clinical–pathologic parameters with survival

outcomes. Multivariate Cox proportional hazard model was
applied using a stepwise forward (Wald) method to detect independent prognostic factors of disease-free survival (DFS). Twotailed P < 0.05 was considered signiﬁcant, and the conﬁdence
intervals (CI) were quoted at the 95% level. The results were
presented as the mean and SEM.

Results
Characteristics of established gemcitabine-resistant cells
To uncover the molecular evolution of gemcitabine resistance in breast cancer, we generated a gemcitabine-resistant cell
subline of MDA-231 cells via 12 cycles of exposure to gradually
increasing concentrations of gemcitabine, as described in Materials and Methods. The gemcitabine-resistant subline was
termed MDA-231-Gem (Fig. 1A). To evaluate the chemosensitivity of the MDA-231-Gem subline, dose–response curves
were generated to examine cell viability in response to gemcitabine. As shown in Fig. 1B, the gemcitabine half-maximal
inhibitory concentration (IC50) value for MDA-231-Gem cells
was 14.48 nmol/L, which was 9-fold higher than that for the
parental line (MDA-231, IC50 ¼ 1.63 nmol/L). In addition, the
clonogenicity of MDA-231-Gem cells was signiﬁcantly higher
than that of MDA-231 cells in response to gemcitabine treatment (Fig. 1C).
To explore the genes involved in gemcitabine resistance, we
performed microarrays to obtain the mRNA expression proﬁles
of the parental and resistant cells. And we conducted Gene
Ontology (GO) analyses for the intersecting genes, which were
generated by combining the Gene Set Enrichment Analysis

(GSEA) and mRNA microarray results described in Materials
and Methods. The GO terms revealed that the activated pathways were primarily related to nucleotide and drug metabolism
processes (Fig. 1D). The most signiﬁcant genes in relevant
pathways, which are listed in Supplementary Table S3, were
validated by qPCR (Supplementary Fig. S1). Collectively, these
data showed that we successfully established gemcitabine-resistant MDA-231-Gem cells that exhibited higher viability in the
presence of gemcitabine.
Elevated CDA expression was attributed to gemcitabine
resistance in breast cancer cells
Encouraged by the GO analysis mentioned above and by
the results of previous studies, which have suggested that
gemcitabine metabolism is related to the cytotoxic effect of
gemcitabine and/or chemoresistant processes, we investigated
the pharmacogenomics of the gemcitabine metabolic pathway.
On the basis of the mRNA microarrays, the transcriptional
levels of key metabolic enzymes related to gemcitabine were
included in a metabolic diagram (Fig. 2A) and conﬁrmed by
qPCR (Supplementary Fig. S2). We noticed that CDA, which
inactivates gemcitabine through deamination, was upregulated in MDA-231-Gem cells compared with other metabolic
enzymes.
Next, we examined CDA expression at both the mRNA and
protein levels in a panel of breast cancer cell lines (Fig. 2B and C).
The results demonstrated that CDA was expressed in MDA-231
and MDA-436 human breast cancer cells, whereas CDA was
expressed at substantially lower levels in MCF7, ZR-75-30,

CDA were determined by qPCR in a panel of breast cancer cell lines. GAPDH was used as an internal control. C, protein levels of endogenous CDA were detected by
Western blotting in a panel of breast cancer cell lines. D and E, after being infected with a CDA-expressing retrovirus or control retrovirus, the cells were subjected
to Western blotting. F and G, forced expression of CDA promoted gemcitabine resistance in MDA-231 and MCF-7 cells; the IC50 for each cell line is presented.

MDA-468, and Hs-578T cells. Consistent with the trend from
microarray results, the mRNA and protein expression levels of
CDA in MDA-231-Gem cells were relatively higher than those in
other breast cancer cell lines.
To examine how CDA was involved in gemcitabine resistance in breast cancers, we established stable HA-Flag–tagged
CDA-overexpressing MDA-231 and MCF7 cells with normal
and lower endogenous CDA expression levels, respectively
(Fig. 2D and E). The cytotoxicity assay showed that the
gemcitabine IC50 for MDA-231 cells with exogenous CDA
(MDA-231/HF-CDA) was more than 11-fold higher than
that for MDA-231 control cells (MDA-231/HF-con; Fig.
2F). Furthermore, similar results were found in MCF7 trans-

www.aacrjournals.org

fectants; the gemcitabine IC50 for MCF7 cells stably expressing HA-Flag–tagged CDA (MCF7/HF-CDA) was more
than 2.3-fold higher than that for control cells (MCF7/
HF-con; Fig. 2G).
To assess whether the knockdown of CDA expression could
reverse chemoresistance to gemcitabine, we silenced CDA in
MDA-231-Gem cells via infection with a lentivirus containing
CDA-targeting shRNAs (Fig. 2H). We found that the depletion of
CDA expression reduced breast cancer cell chemoresistance to
gemcitabine compared with the controls (Fig. 2I). These results
showed that CDA expression tightly correlated with the chemosensitivity of breast cancer cells with regard to gemcitabine
treatment.

CDA suppresses cell proliferation and causes cell-cycle
redistribution in breast cancer cells
Previously, CDA was shown to participate in the metabolism of
cytidine/deoxycytidine, accounting for the conversion of cytidine/
deoxycytidine into uridine/deoxyuridine in cells (Fig. 3A; ref. 22).
Thus, it is plausible that CDA could exert effects on DNA replication in the absence of genotoxic stress. Taking the physiologic
functions of CDA into consideration, we conducted cell proliferation assays and found that MDA-231-Gem cells with
acquired high CDA expression exhibited a lower proliferation
rate than parental MDA-231 cells (Fig. 3B). Furthermore, CDA
overexpression decreased the cell proliferation rate of MDA231 and MCF-7 cells (Fig. 3C and D), whereas CDA knockdown
enhanced the proliferation of MDA-231-Gem cells (Fig. 3E).

These data support the notion that CDA can inhibit breast
cancer cell proliferation.
In general, DNA replication requires a number of factors that
can regulate replication forks, including replication fork components, the nucleotide pool, histones, and histone chaperones
(23). As CDA serves as a key modulator in the conversion of
cytidine/deoxycytidine to uridine/deoxyuridine, this enzyme
might affect the balance of the nucleotide pools and slow
down the replication fork speed. Therefore, we examined the
cell-cycle distribution in the indicated cell lines. We found that
the percentage of cells in S-phase substantially increased in the
MDA-231-Gem cells compared with the parental line (Fig. 3F).
In addition, exogenous expression of CDA in MDA-231 and
MCF-7 cells led to an increased proportion of cells in S-phase

Figure 3.
Elevated CDA expression led to cell proliferation inhibition and S-phase enrichment in breast cancer cells. A, diagram showing how CDA is involved in the cytidine/
deoxycytidine metabolic pathway in cells. B–E, cell proliferation assays were conducted in the indicated cell lines. High expression of CDA suppresses cell
proliferation, whereas the knockdown of CDA expression shows the opposite effect. F–I, ﬂow cytometry was performed to detect the cell-cycle distribution of the
indicated cell lines. CDA overexpression caused S-phase accumulation compared with control cells, whereas the knockdown of CDA expression reversed this
phenomenon. The assays were performed in triplicate; representative results are shown. These data represent the mean values, with error bars indicating the SEM
( , P < 0.05).

miR-484/CDA Axis in Breast Cancer

(Fig. 3G and H). When a lentivirus containing a CDA-targeting
shRNA was introduced into MDA-231-Gem cells, the previously observed S-phase enrichment was reversed (Fig. 3I). Taken
together, these data suggest that CDA plays a key role in
modulating cell-cycle redistribution and the replication process
and, more importantly, that this effect is evident in the absence
of cytotoxic stress.
Cyclin E–CDK2 complex and its associated molecules are
involved in CDA-mediated cell-cycle redistribution
The marked effects of CDA on cell proliferation and cell-cycle
redistribution led us to examine the mechanisms involved by
characterizing its effects on the activity, modiﬁcation, and expression of important regulators of the G1- to S-phase transition.
During G1–S progression, cyclin E associates with cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (CDK2) to form a complex that is required for entry
into S-phase (24–26). Given the central role of cyclin E–CDK2
in the control of G1- to S-phase progression, we performed
Western blot analyses of the cyclin E–CDK2 complex in the
indicated cell lines. We found that cyclin E and CDK2 were
downregulated when CDA was highly expressed in MDA-231Gem cells. Although the trend was weaker, the cyclin E–CDK2
complex expression also decreased in MDA-231/HF-CDA cells

Figure 4.
Cyclin E–CDK2 complex and its associated molecules were associated with
CDA-induced cell-cycle redistribution. A, CDA suppressed the activation
of the cyclin E–CDK2 complex and its downstream molecules. Western
blotting was conducted to detect the cell-cycle checkpoint–associated
proteins using antibodies against cyclin E, CDK2, cyclin A, phospho-Rb, Rb,
and E2F1. The amounts of CDA, HA, and b-actin were detected as controls.
B, CDA depletion upregulated the expression of the above proteins. The cell
extracts were analyzed by Western blotting using the indicated antibodies.
All bands were quantiﬁed by densitometric analysis.

www.aacrjournals.org

(Fig. 4A), whereas silenced CDA increased the expression of cyclin
E–CDK2 complex (Fig. 4B). During the cell-cycle transition from
G1 into S-phase, cyclin A associates with CDK2, replacing cyclin E.
When the amount of the cyclin A–CDK2 complex reaches a
threshold, it terminates the assembly of the cyclin E–CDK2
complex, thus facilitating DNA replication in S-phase (27). Herein, we examined cyclin A protein in the indicated cells and
observed a similar trend for the cyclin E–CDK2 complex, which
inversely correlated with CDA expression (Fig. 4A and B). Similar
to all cyclin–CDK complex family members, the cyclin E–CDK2
complex regulates multiple cellular processes by phosphorylating
numerous downstream proteins. The cyclin E–CDK2 complex
phosphorylates the retinoblastoma (Rb) protein to promote the
G1- to S-phase transition. Phosphorylated Rb protein no longer
interacts with the E2F transcription factor, thus promoting the
transcription of downstream genes that drive cells to overcome
the G1–S checkpoint (28). As shown in Fig. 4, the trends for
phospho-Rb status, Rb expression, and E2F expression were
similar to the expression of the cyclin E–CDK2 complex, suggesting that high CDA levels might reduce cyclin E–CDK2 complex
expression and suppress the activities of its downstream pathway.
These data indicate that the cyclin E–CDK2 complex and its
associated signaling are involved in CDA-induced cell-cycle
redistribution.
miR-484 serves as a posttranscriptional regulator to
downregulate CDA expression by directly targeting its 30 -UTR
Accumulating evidence has shown that miRNA deregulation is
involved in multiple cellular and biologic processes, including cell
proliferation and chemoresistance (14–16, 29, 30). In an attempt
to understand the underlying regulatory network of CDA-modulated gemcitabine chemoresistance, cell proliferation, and cellcycle redistribution, we hypothesized that several miRNAs might
function by directly targeting CDA, thus regulating CDA-induced
cellular responses. We predicted potential miRNAs that might
target the 30 -UTR sequence of CDA using four prediction algorithms: PicTar5, TargetScan, miRanda, and miRWalk. Thirty-four
candidate miRNAs were predicted to regulate CDA expression by
all 4 algorithms (Fig. 5A). We compared the miRNA expression
proﬁle of MDA-231-Gem cells to that of parental cells using
Agilent miRNA microarrays. By intersecting the results of in silico
predictions with discrepant miRNAs from miRNA microarrays,
only 3 candidate miRNAs, miR-339-5p, miR-345-5p, and miR484, were shown to be expressed at substantially lower levels
among the 34 predicted CDA-associated miRNAs (Fig. 5B). qPCR
analysis conﬁrmed that the expression levels of miR-339-5p, miR345-5p, and miR-484 were reduced in MDA-231-Gem cells compared with parental cells (Supplementary Fig. S3). We then
constructed a gemcitabine-metabolic mRNA–miRNA network
and a putative direct-target subnetwork (Supplementary Fig.
S4). As illustrated in this network, CDA was one of the remarkable
genes in the gemcitabine metabolic pathway, and miR-339-5p,
miR-345-5p, and miR-484 displayed stronger correlations with
CDA than other miRNAs. Analysis of the 30 -UTR sequence of CDA
using TargetScan demonstrated possible binding sites for miR339-5p, miR-345-5p, and miR-484 (Fig. 5C). According to the
above analyses, we hypothesized that these 3 miRNAs might play
crucial roles in regulating CDA expression.
To verify whether CDA was regulated by miR-339-5p, miR-3455p, and miR-484 through direct binding to its 30 -UTR, a series of
30 -UTR fragments including the full-length 30 -UTR binding site

(Fig. 5D). For luciferase activity assay, miR-339-5p, miR-3455p, or miR-484 was cotransfected with different luciferase–30 UTR constructs into HEK-293T cells. The relative luciferase
activity was remarkably reduced by miR-339-5p, miR-3455p, or miR-484, when the full-length wild-type 30 -UTR of CDA
was presented (Fig. 5E–G). These reductions were sequencespeciﬁc because the relative luciferase activity did not drop as
sharply in UTRs that contained mutant binding sites as in those
that contained wild-type binding sites. In addition, Western
blot analyses indicated that CDA protein levels decreased
slightly in the presence of exogenous miR-339-5p and miR345-5p; in contrast, the forced expression of miR-484 efﬁciently
inhibited endogenous CDA protein expression in MDA-231Gem cells (Fig. 5H). The above observation prompted us to
further explore the correlations between CDA expression and
miR-339-5p, miR-345-5p, and miR-484 in 30 primary breast
cancer cases (Fig. 5I–K). Notably, among these 3 miRNAs, only
miR-484 signiﬁcantly negatively correlated with CDA expression (P ¼ 0.0065, Pearson R ¼ 0.486). According to the above
analyses, we concluded that miR-484 was the most efﬁcient
miRNA that could downregulate CDA expression by directly
targeting its 30 -UTR.

miR-484/CDA axis modulates gemcitabine resistance, cell
proliferation regulation, and cell-cycle redistribution in breast
cancer cells
Because we showed that miR-484 could posttranscriptionally reduce CDA expression by directly targeting its 30 -UTR,
we hypothesized that miR-484 could attenuate CDA-mediated functions. To verify this hypothesis, we constructed
lentivirus-based vectors harboring miR-484 and control
and established 2 stable cell lines through lentivirus transduction, which were denoted MDA-231-Gem/miR-484 and
MDA-231-Gem/miR-con. As indicated in Fig. 6A, CDA
expression levels were substantially reduced by miR-484
compared with the corresponding controls. Subsequently,
the stable cell lines were subjected to cell cytotoxicity and
proliferation assays and cell-cycle analysis. We found that a
reduction in CDA through miR-484 overexpression affected
the cells in a manner similar to that induced by shRNA
interference (Fig. 6B–D).
If CDA indeed acts as a direct target of miR-484, reintroduction
of CDA into miR-484–expressing cells should antagonize
the effects of miR-484. To test this hypothesis, we introduced
a retrovirus-based construct expressing the CDA sequence without
its 30 -UTR into MDA-231-Gem/miR-484 cells (Fig. 6E). As
expected, we found that the reintroduction of CDA enhanced

levels were analyzed by Western blotting. F–H, effects of miR-484 could be reversed by reintroduction of CDA. Cytotoxicity assays, cell viability assays, and
cell-cycle analyses were conducted in the indicated cell lines. The data represent the mean values, with error bars indicating the SEM ( , P < 0.05).

gemcitabine resistance in miR-484–expressing cells (Fig. 6F).
Furthermore, miR-484–induced cell proliferation was also antagonized by the forced expression of CDA (Fig. 6G), and forced CDA
expression counteracted the S-phase reduction induced by miR484 (Fig. 6H). Thus, CDA reintroduction could abrogate multiple
miR-484–induced phenotypes. Together, our results revealed
that miR-484 could comprehensively attenuate the functions of
CDA, suggesting that CDA is a downstream functional target for
miR-484.
Expression of CDA is frequently downregulated, inversely
correlated with miR-484, and linked to improved DFS in breast
cancer patients receiving non–gemcitabine-based treatments
Considering the multiple roles of the miR484/CDA axis, we
sought to evaluate the signiﬁcance of this pathway in primary
breast tumors in the absence of gemcitabine treatment. CDA
expression was examined in 30 pairs of primary breast tumors
and their corresponding adjacent noncancerous mammary
tissues using qPCR. As shown in Fig. 7A, the levels of CDA
mRNA were frequently downregulated in breast tumors compared with paired noncancerous mammary tissues (23 of 30).
This downregulation was documented using paired t test with a
P value of 0.0034 (Fig. 7B). CDA is the functional target of
miR-484; therefore, the expression level of mature miR-484
was also detected in paired mammary tissues by qPCR. In
contrast to CDA, miR-484 levels were signiﬁcantly upregulated
in primary breast cancer tissues (P ¼ 0.0002, Fig. 7C). Next, we
examined the protein expression level of CDA using IHC
analyses on TMAs including 193 primary breast tumors and
36 noncancerous mammary controls (Fig. 7D). We found that
the CDA protein exhibited a strong signal in a large fraction of
the noncancerous mammary tissues (34 of 36, 94.44%),
whereas the CDA protein was expressed at reduced levels in
nearly 40% (75 of 193, 38.86%) of the primary breast tumors
(Fig. 7E, top). The clinicopathologic characteristics of the
studied cohort are summarized in Supplementary Table S4.
We noticed that CDA expression exhibited a tight association
with estrogen receptor (ER) status in breast cancer (P ¼
0.017; Fig. 7E, bottom); however, no correlation between CDA
level and other clinicopathologic features was found (Supplementary Table S4).
To assess the clinical signiﬁcance of CDA in breast cancer, we
analyzed the relationship between CDA and DFS in the above
cohort. Among 193 breast cancer cases, the clinical outcomes of
177 cases were obtained. Kaplan–Meier analysis suggested that
higher CDA expression correlated with prolonged DFS in this
cohort (P ¼ 0.023; Fig. 7F). Consistent with our results, the
analysis derived from a large public clinical database of breast
cancer (Kaplan–Meier plotter) provided additional support
that high levels of CDA expression correlated with a better
DFS in patients with breast cancer (P ¼ 6.1  108, Fig. 7G;
ref. 19). Moreover, both univariate and adjusted multivariate
survival analyses suggested a signiﬁcant difference between
CDA-high and CDA-low groups in our cohort. The univariate
analysis demonstrated that elevated CDA expression indicated
a lower risk for disease relapse (HR, 0.485; 95% CI, 0.257–
0.918; P ¼ 0.026; Supplementary Table S5), and the adjusted
multivariate analysis using Cox regression model also showed
that high CDA expression was an independent favorable prognostic factor of DFS in patients with breast cancer (HR, 0.375;
95% CI, 0.193–0.732; P ¼ 0.004; Supplementary Table S5).

Taken together, our ﬁndings suggested that the level of CDA
expression might serve as a valuable prognostic marker for
patients with breast cancer.

Discussion
Gemcitabine chemoresistance is a considerable clinical obstacle in chemotherapy for patients with breast cancer. Here, we
explored the potential regulatory mechanism responsible for
gemcitabine resistance, by using the combination of bioinformatic analysis and functional screening. We demonstrated that
CDA overexpression reduced cell sensitivity to gemcitabine, and
this ﬁnding is consistent with previous studies showing that CDA
deaminates deoxycytidine analogue-type cytotoxic drugs, such as
cytarabine, gemcitabine, and 5-aza-20 -deoxycytidine, thus preventing the intracellular accumulation of their active metabolites
(10, 31–33). Taken together, these results indicate that CDA is a
regulator that contributes to gemcitabine resistance in breast
cancer. These ﬁndings may stimulate research into the development of superior CDA inhibitors as potential agents to potentiate
gemcitabine chemotherapy.
Unexpectedly, in this study, we found that CDA inhibited cell
proliferation in breast cancer cells. Moreover, CDA downregulation was a frequent event in human mammary cancers, and CDA
positivity correlated with prolonged DFS in patients with breast
cancer. These results suggest that CDA might function as a tumor
suppressor in mammary tumorigenesis. Apparently, the biologic
characteristics of CDA in breast cancer development conﬂict with
those of acquired gemcitabine resistance in cancer chemotherapy.
Indeed, unlike other chemoresistance genes, which are primarily
identiﬁed as oncogenes, we showed that CDA acts as a suppressor
of cell proliferation and as a prognostic marker of favorable
outcome in breast cancer. Thus, our ﬁndings indicate that CDA,
which could differentially induce gemcitabine resistance and
suppress cell proliferation, might play various biologic roles
during breast cancer development.
The eukaryotic cell cycle is regulated by the coordinated activity
of protein kinase complexes, consisting of CDKs and cyclins (34).
For instance, progression through G1 and entry into S-phase are
regulated by the cyclin E–CDK2 and cyclin A–CDK2 complexes,
respectively (35). Downstream signaling molecules of the cyclin
E–CDK2 pathway, such as E2F1 and Rb, are also involved in cellcycle regulation. The phosphorylation of Rb by cyclin-dependent
kinases at the G1- to S-phase transition leads to the dissociation of
Rb from E2F, allowing cells to resume cell-cycle progression (36).
We found that high CDA expression could suppress the cyclin E–
CDK2 complex and its downstream signaling proteins, including
the E2F1, phospho-Rb, and Rb proteins. It appears that decreased
cyclin E–CDK2 complex expression could partly explain why
breast cancer cells undergo CDA-induced cell-cycle arrest. However, whether the effects of CDA on these proteins are direct or
indirect remains to be elucidated and some other mechanisms
might be responsible for the CDA-mediated decrease in cell
proliferation. Additional experiments are required for a more
thorough understanding of these effects.
Notably, there is an emerging concept of cell-cycle–mediated
drug resistance that cells may be relatively insensitive to a chemotherapeutic agent due to its current state in the cell cycle (37).
Previous reports have demonstrated that ﬂuorouracil, which is
an antimetabolite agent similar to gemcitabine, became less
effective in colon cancer cells when cell-cycle progression was

However, at this point, this hypothesis is highly speculative. In our

cells was 8.42  104 nmol/L, which was more than 10,000-fold
lower than that for the control cells (MDA-231-Gem/sh-con, IC50
¼ 13.2 nmol/L). These data suggested that CDA might be a speciﬁc
regulator of gemcitabine resistance. The results of previous studies
have provided evidence that CDA deaminates gemcitabine to
prevent the intracellular accumulation of its active metabolite as
a chemoresistance-conferring gene (31–33). Thus, CDA-induced
chemoresistance is more likely due to its deamination effect.
One important ﬁnding in our study was the discovery of the
relationship between CDA and breast cancer patient prognosis, in
which CDA highly correlated with DFS and independently contributed to better survival in the absence of gemcitabine treatment. Conversely, Schroder and colleagues reported that CDA was
associated with poor prognosis in patients with acute myeloid
leukemia (40). Regarding this controversial point, we speculated
that the speciﬁc evaluation criteria for breast cancer in this study
differed from those used for leukemia in previous papers. In this
study, we observed that CDA expression was associated with
prolonged DFS in patients treated with non–gemcitabine-based
adjuvant chemotherapy. The criteria for included cases in our
cohort must be interpreted with caution. At present, gemcitabine
is recommended for the ﬁrst-line treatment of patients with breast
cancer after the failure of prior anthracycline-containing adjuvant
chemotherapy, according to Chinese Anti-Cancer Association
guidelines or National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines (41). Because gemcitabine has not been recommended for
adjuvant chemotherapy of patients with primary breast cancer
according to current guidelines, most patients with primary breast
cancer did not receive gemcitabine during adjuvant chemotherapy in our cohorts. Meanwhile, the patients who received gemcitabine-based treatment in our hospital were conﬁrmed to have
recurrent or metastatic breast cancer for which operative treatment
was not suitable. Because of these limitations, we could not obtain
sufﬁcient breast cancer samples to evaluate the CDA expression in
patients receiving gemcitabine treatment. Therefore, we drew
conclusions using our current cohorts of primary breast cancer
patients receiving non–gemcitabine-based adjuvant chemotherapy. Of course, an additional cohort of patients receiving gemcitabine-based chemotherapy may be needed to form a general
understanding of the role of CDA in breast cancer.
As indicated in previous studies, miR-484 exhibits multifunctional characteristics and participates in many physical and pathologic processes. miR-484 can modulate chemosensitivity to
carboplatin- and taxol-based regimens by targeting the VEGF
protein in neoplastic cells or by interfering with the receptor
VEGFR2 in serous ovarian carcinomas (42). In addition, circulating miR-484 in sera may be an endogenous control miRNA and
may be used to distinguish patients with pancreatic cancer from
healthy people (43). Here, we found that miR-484 could sensitize

breast cancer cells to gemcitabine treatment and attenuate CDAmediated growth inhibition by directly targeting the CDA 30 -UTR.
Our results provide the ﬁrst line of evidence that miR-484 is an
effective CDA antagonist in breast cancer.
In conclusion, this study elucidates a new molecular mechanism for gemcitabine resistance and cell-cycle regulation in breast
cancer cells through the miR-484/CDA axis. Our results indicate
that this miR-484–modulated CDA has a dual impact in regulating gemcitabine resistance as a chemoresistance indicator and in
modulating cell cycle and cell proliferation, further serving as a
favorable prognostic marker in breast cancer. Importantly, our
ﬁndings regarding the miR-484/CDA axis provide a new avenue
for understanding of the pathogenic tradeoffs associated with the
evolution of chemoresistance in breast cancer.
