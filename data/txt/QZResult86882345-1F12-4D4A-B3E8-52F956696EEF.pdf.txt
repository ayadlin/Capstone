ABSTRACT:

The biological programs of vertebrates exhibit a remarkable degree of functional
degeneracy, adaptive compensation and robustness, to preserve homeostasis
and generate reproducible phenotypic outputs irrespective of variations in signal
strength, noise and quality. Cancers are difficult to treat not only because they
are so mechanistically diverse but also because they adapt or evolve in response
to any pharmacological elective pressure we impose upon them. Hence, an ideal
cancer drug target would exert a function both necessary for cancer cell survival
and functionally non-redundant, rendering it impossible for tumor cells to
compensate for, or evolve independence from, the inhibitory effect of any drug
aimed at that target. In this review, we discuss the unique, non-degenerate and
highly pleiotropic role played by Myc in coordinating, engaging and maintaining
the diverse intracellular and extracellular programs required for cell proliferation
in vivo. These properties make Myc a compelling candidate cancer drug target,
at least in principle: an assertion recently reinforced by new in vivo genetic data.

WHY ARE CANCERS DIFFICULT TO
CURE?

within tumor cell populations in each individual tumor.
Such innate genetic diversity feeds the engines of further
evolution – in essence, each tumor must be treated as an
evolving species rather than as a unitary object.
Many point to this alarming genetic diversity in
cancers – an inevitable consequence of the haphazard
and directionless way that each cancer evolves, as the
principal reason why cancers have proven so difficult to
treat. The idea is that past cancer therapies were applied
fairly indiscriminately against many different genetic
pathologies and what is needed is a therapy that is
tailored to the particular complement of genetic lesions
in each individual’s cancer – cancer therapy will need to
be personalized. With the advent of new-targeted drugs,
engineered to inhibit specific defects in specific cancers
types, many hope that this may, at least, be feasible.
However, this disregards a more fundamental reason for
intractability of cancers, which is that cancer cells adapt
and evolve. Biological ”wetwear” is inherently noisy and
protean and works reliably only because it has evolved
to be robust. Such robustness involves a great deal of
functional redundancy, intrinsic error correction and
inherent self-organization. Targeting a biological system

Cancers are extremely multifarious diseases that
arise through the accumulation in somatic cells of
mutations in the genes that regulate and restrain cell
multiplication, survival, repair, movement and invasion.
The process is “Darwinian” – oncogenic mutations occur
at random and fate of the mutant cells and their progeny
is determined by their relative “fitness” – in this case,
their relative capacities to survive and propagate in and,
eventually, spread from, their requisite somatic niche.
While the mutations that fuel tumor evolution occur
randomly, their evolutionary tradjectories are shaped
by the selective pressures that normally limit untoward
somatic cell growth – principally the restricted and
tightly regulated availability of mitogenic and survival
signals, barriers to cell migration and macroscopic
tumor expansion, and the relentless vigilance of innate
tumor suppressor pathways. Not surprisingly, given the
haphazard and aleatory way in which individual cancers
evolve, each cancer in each patient is unique. Indeed, it is
now clear that there is a substantial genetic diversity even

with a drug is just another source of noise and variability
and, if it is able, the system spontaneously compensates,
re-routing signals and restoring homeostasis. Then, in
those rare situations where compensation is insufficient,
evolution takes over: spontaneously arising mutant cancer
clones resistant to the targeted drug rapidly outgrow their
incapacitated siblings and the patient relapses. The chilling
truth is that it doesn’t matter how effective/ specific a
therapy is – if its target function can be circumvented by
compensation or evolution, that therapy will inevitably
fail – clinically, it is just a matter of when.

One appealing strategy has been to limit the capacity for
evolution of resistance by targeting the genetically normal
and stable stromal compartment of tumors rather than
genetically unstable cancer cells themselves. Expansion
and maintenance of macroscopic tumors are dependent on
their somatic microenvironment, a complicated melange
of stromal, vascular and inflammatory cell types that
provides necessary oxygen, nutrients, and survival factors.
This obligate role played by the genetically stable tumor
microenvironment in macroscopic tumor maintenance has
spurred a variety of novel therapeutic approaches aimed at
neutralizing tumor cell-nonautonomous components of the
tumor mass, such as tumor vasculature and inflammation.
Unfortunately, the effectiveness of such therapies is
thwarted by the highly robust and functionally degenerate
nature of the extracellular programmes that maintain the
tumor microenvironment, making them highly adaptive inhibition of one node triggers homeostatic compensatory
re-routing through others [1-4]. Such functional
redundancy, together with the highly interdependent and
reciprocal relationship between tumor cells and their
microenvironment, involving interactions with diverse
stromal, vascular and inflammatory cell types, makes it
difficult to dissect out the cause-and-effect dependencies
linking the two and, consequently, where best to intervene
for optimal therapeutic benefit.
An alternative potential strategy for thwarting cancer
cell compensation and evolution is to identify therapeutic
targets that are essential for the survival of cancer cells
but are not functionally redundant and whose inhibition,
therefore, cannot be circumvented by compensation or
evolution. Do such targets exist? Can we make drugs
that inhibit them? How bad might the side effects of such
therapies be, given that such central engines of biology are
likely to serve important functions in many normal cells
and tissues? These become the critical questions.

the need for binary switchability. The consolidated

The robustness of biological programs is a
prerequisite for self-organizing homeostasis and for the
generation of reproducible phenotypic outputs even when
the signals directing such outputs are variable, noisy and
capricious. Such robustness is manifest in the remarkable
capacity of biological systems to resist and correct for
perturbation and to rebuild after damage. Nonetheless,
biological systems must also have the capacity to drive
binary decisions – cells either arrest or proliferate, live or
die, remain a progenitor or differentiate, stay put or move.
How can the capacity to execute unequivocal decisions
be accommodated with a biology that has evolved to
resist perturbation? We suggest that these two antithetical
imperatives are reconciled by connecting functionally
degenerate, robust networks with functionally non-

outputs from robust, self-correcting and functionally degenerate
information-gathering and information-processing “clouds”
(e.g. receptor tyrosine kinases, intracellular kinases, disparate
coordinated programs mediating somatic cell replication and
propagation) are hypothesized to funnel down into functionally
non-degenerate, go/no go switches such Ras, Myc and the
activating E2F (E2F1, 2 & 3a) proteins. The obligate and
functionally non-degenerate properties of Myc, Ras and E2F
make them a unique class of therapeutic drug target, whose
inhibition cannot easily be circumvented by compensatory or
evolutionary mechanisms. However, the very essentialness of
these targets raises the specter of severe side effects. In this
regard, Myc has the advantage that, since its sole biological role
appears to be in cell proliferation, the only side effects of Myc
inhibition are likely to affect regenerating tissues.

degenerate network nodes. In this way, the net outputs
of diffuse, robust networks are distilled into binary Go/
No-go decisions. This idea is depicted for cell growth
signaling in Figure 1: the consolidated outputs from
highly degenerate information gathering and information
processing effector “clouds” (e.g. ligated receptor
tyrosine kinases, intracellular kinases, proliferation
genes) are funneled into functionally non-degenerate
nodes such as Ras, Myc and mitogenic E2F (E2F1, 2 &
3a), whose activities serve to commit information flow
down to the next functionally robust and degenerate cloud
of effectors. When it comes to treating such a protean
and evolutionarily adaptable pathology as cancer, such
ubiquitously essential and functionally non-redundant
nodes are especially intriguing pharmacological targets.
In this review, we consider the potential of inhibiting Myc
as a general treatment for cancers.
Myc is a basic helix–loop–helix leucine zipper
transcription factor that coordinates the diverse
transcriptional programs necessary for cell growth,
proliferation, invasion, expansion and angiogenesis, as
well as a variety of protective checkpoint mechanisms
such as growth arrest and apoptosis [5-7]. Myc’s highly
pleiotropic effects are mirrored by its enormous range
of gene targets. Expression array, SAGE, chromatin IP,
promoter scanning and whole cell proteomic approaches
indicate thousands of Myc target genes with roles in
virtually every aspect of cell and tissue behavior [8-17].
Myc is present at very low levels in normal cells; both
the short-lived c-Myc protein and its equally short-lived
mRNA are tightly and continuously dependent upon
external mitogens.
Because of the unique and pivotal role that only Myc
can fill in coordinating the transcription of its thousands
of target genes, Myc is functionally non-redundant.
And while there are three discrete members of the Myc
transcription factor family (of which at least two, c-Myc
and N-Myc, appear largely isofunctional), most adult cells
rely solely on c-Myc to integrate the transcription of their
proliferative programs. By contrast, N-Myc and L-Myc
are restricted to various stages of tissue development,
although recently it has become evident that N-Myc, and
perhaps L-Myc, are expressed in stem and progenitor
compartments of both normal and neoplastic adult tissues.
c-Myc null mice fail to develop beyond embryonic day
9.5 [18] while Rat1 fibroblasts (which, incidentally,
express neither N-myc or L-myc) in which both copies of
the c-myc gene have been ablated by targeted homologous
recombination exhibit greatly reduced rates of RNA,
protein translation and protein degradation and profoundly
slowed proliferation, with severe defects at multiple
points in the cell cycle [19]. These observations indicate
that, in effect, Myc serves as the unique, functionally nonredundant node that relays diverse upstream intracellular

www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

mitogenic signals to the legion of downstream genetic
programs that implement cell proliferation (Figure 1).
Intriguingly, Myc is deregulated and/or overexpressed
in the majority of cancers, where it hijacks the same diverse
intracellular and extracellular regenerative programs that
drive normal somatic cell expansion. Ectopic activation of
c-Myc alone is usually insufficient to drive tumorigenesis
without the cooperation of additional sporadic oncogenic
lesions, in great part because elevated Myc expression
is a potent trigger of apoptosis [20-25], one of several
intrinsic tumor suppressive mechanisms that antagonizes
the neoplastic potential of dominant oncogenes [26]. It
may be for this reason that oncogenic activation of Myc
is infrequently a driving lesion in cancers, at least in
early stage tumors. Rather, Myc expression is typically
deregulated and elevated due to oncogenic mutations in
upstream signaling pathways that relentlessly and inaptly
drive endogenous Myc expression.
The in vivo oncogenic impact of deregulated Myc
has been explored in detail using a variety of switchable
transgenic mouse models in which regulatable forms
of Myc, expressed at high level, have been targeted to
specific tissues. Using a conditional form of Myc fused
to a modified hormone binding domain of the estrogen
receptor (MycERTAM) that is responsive only to the synthetic
steroid 4-hydroxytamoxifen (4-OHT) [27], activation of
Myc alone was shown to trigger rapid proliferation and
disruption of differentiation when targeted to suprabasal
keratinocytes in vivo, resulting in dramatic papillomatosis
that rapidly regressed upon subsequent inactivation of
MycERTAM [28]. Intriguingly, sustained Myc activation
was, alone, sufficient to induce not only epidermal
cell expansion but also the rapid and dramatic onset of
dermal angiogenesis in regions adjacent to the Mycdriven papillomas in great part, due to the elevated levels
of VEGF secreted by Myc-expressing keratinocytes.
Such angiogenesis is continuously dependent on Myc
activity since subsequent Myc de-activation triggers
abrupt vascular collapse and regression of papillomas
[28]. In a different switchable Myc transgenic model,
acute activation of MycERTAM in pancreatic β cells in
vivo triggered rapid and wholesale β cell proliferation:
in this case, however, β cell expansion was curtailed by
concomitant induction of β cell apoptosis, resulting in
net islet attrition. Nonetheless, when such apoptosis was
blocked by co-expression of the apoptosis inhibitor BclxL, Myc activation triggered sustained and progressive β
cell expansion, rapidly leading to the formation of large,
locally invasive, inflammatory and highly angiogenic
β cell tumors [29]. The rapidity and synchrony with
which such Myc-driven β cell neoplasms acquire such
ostensibly diverse neoplastic attributes indicates that all
such traits are directly instructed by Myc, and not the
result of subsequent mutations [29]. Moreover, just as
in skin, subsequent c-Myc deactivation triggered rapid
and complete regression of islet tumors, accompanied

by collapse of tumor vasculature and microenvironment.
Several similar studies in other tissues confirm that,
in most cases, sustained Myc expression is required to
maintain Myc-driven tumors [30-33], although there
are occasional exceptions to this due to compensatory
activation of alternate oncogenic signaling pathways
[34]. In such instances, Myc de-induction is accompanied
by growth arrest, terminal differentiation and vascular
collapse. Indeed, even brief inactivation of Myc appears
to offer potential therapeutic value [35-37], fueling the
contemporary concept of “oncogene addiction” – an
hypothesized acquired dependency in which tumor
cells become dependent on the aberrantly sustained flux
running through the oncogenic lesions. Given the capacity
of Myc to drive and maintain both angiogenesis and local
inflammation and stromal remodeling, at least some
of this dependency appears to be due to collapse of the
tumor microenvironment when oncogenic Myc is turned
off [38].
Indeed, a detailed kinetic expression array analysis
following acute activation and subsequent deactivation
of Myc in pancreatic β cells revealed a clear and direct
instructive role for Myc in initiating and maintaining
the sustaining interplay between tumor cells and their
microenvironment [39]. Acute activation of c-Myc was
found to trigger expression and release of interleukin
1β (IL-1β), a pleiotropic cytokine implicated in acute
and chronic inflammation and a potent inducer of
metalloproteinase activity. This, in turn, triggered the
release of pre-existing, extracellular matrix-bound VEGF,
liberating it to bind its cognate receptor on endothelial
cells, and thereby flicking the angiogenic switch [40].
c-Myc activation also triggers the rapid induction of a
cluster of chemokines that likely mediate recruitment to the
tumor site of various inflammatory cells, including mast
cells, macrophages and neutrophils [39]. A subsequent
study demonstrated that mast cell recruitment is essential
for macroscopic tumor expansion and maintenance of
tumor vasculature [41]. Thereafter, a mutually supportive,
reciprocal interaction develops between the Myc-driven β
tumor cells that is necessary for growth and maintenance
of tumors and requires continuous Myc activity for its
maintenance.

the role played by endogenous Myc in tumor induction,
progression and maintenance has, until recently, remained
unclear. A study by Baudino et al. indicated a more
general, physiological role for Myc in angiogenesis c-Myc–/– embryos exhibit deficits in vasculogenesis,
angiogenesis and primitive erythropoiesis and have
reduced expression of VEGF and the angiogenic factor
angiopoietin-2 as well as elevated levels of the angiogenic
inhibitors thrombospondin-1 and angiopoietin-1 in murine
embryonic stem cells and yolk sacs [42]. More recently, the
role played by endogenous Myc, as opposed to ectopically
activated oncogenic Myc, in the maintenance of cancers
driven by other oncogenic mechanisms, addressed the
extent to which endogenous Myc acts as a common
downstream conduit of the upstream oncogenic signals
that drive most human cancers. To do this, a dominant
interfering mutant of Myc, Omomyc, was employed
that displaces Myc’s obligate endogenous partner Max
and thereby prevents Myc from transactivating its target
genes via its concensus E-box elements [43-45]. By
placing systemic Omomyc expression under the control
of doxycyline, Myc function may be reversibly blocked
globally in all tissues in vivo. Systemic inhibition of
Myc in both the well-established LSL–KrasG12D murine
model of non-small cell lung cancer [46] and the
RIP1-Tag2 model of pancreatic insulinomas driven by
SV40 T/t antigens [47] triggered rapid and wholesale
regression of incipient and established tumors [48] [49],
confirming that endogenous Myc function is required
for maintenance of tumors driven by diverse oncogenic
mechanisms. A careful kinetic analysis of Myc-inhibitioninduced tumor regression in the RIP1-Tag2 model
demonstrated that inhibition of endogenous Myc triggers
the rapid collapse of the tumor microenvironment, with
concomitant apoptosis of endothelial cells, suppression
of all detectable interaction between VEGF and its
receptor, inhibition of both recruitment and/or retention
of the inflammatory cells macrophages and neutrophils,
vascular collapse and hypoxia [49, 50]. Moreover, such
collapse of the tumor microenvironment temporally
preceeds death of tumor cells or detectable regression of β
cell tumor masses, strongly suggesting that collapse of the
tumor microenvironment is a cause, not a consequence, of
tumor regression. Furthermore, regression of RIP1-Tag2
tumors occurs with identical kinetics and gross pathology
when endogenous Myc is inhibited solely in the β cell
compartment, confirming that it is endogenous Myc,
within the tumor cells themselves, that is responsible for
establishing and maintaining the signal cross-talk between
tumor and microenvironment [49].
As discussed, the ideal cancer drug target must fulfill
an essential function that is continuously required for
tumor maintenance but dispensable (at least in the short
term) for maintenance and function of any normal tissues.
For optimal therapeutic efficacy, the target should also be
functionally non-redundant – in that way, its inhibition

MYC AS A TARGET FOR CANCER
THERAPY
Such studies indicate the pivotal role that oncogenic
Myc plays in driving and maintaining multiple aspects
of the tumor environment, including angiogenesis,
stromal remodeling, tumor invasion, and recruitment of
inflammatory pathways. However, as already pointed
out, the majority of human tumors are not driven by
Myc mutations but by “upstream” activated oncogenes
mutations in most cancers lie “upstream” in RTKs, Ras,
Wnt or a host of other signaling pathways. In such tumors,

tumors in RIP1-Tag2 mice [49], irrespective of stage
of the tumor progression. At least part of the basis for
this unanticipated tumor specificity is that sustained
Myc activity is required by tumor cells to maintain the
continuous output of angiogenic and pro-inflammatory
factors needed to maintain the peculiarly factor-dependent
microenvironment needed to support solid tumors: hence,
Myc inhibition rapidly triggers the collapse of the tumor
microenvironment. Of note, out of literally hundreds of
individual lung tumors in the KRasG12D-driven NSCLC
mouse model, no tumors resistant to Myc inhibition
have ever emerged (Soucek & Evan, unpublished data),
consistent with the unique, essential non-redundant role
that Myc plays: tumor cells cannot circumvent their need
for Myc by compensation or evolution. It is also, perhaps,
telling that, out of several hundred individual β-cell RIP1Tag2 tumors, each comprised of many thousands of tumor
cells in which both Rb and p53 had been simultaneously
incapacitated, the only occasional tumors that emerged
as resistant to doxycycline had all lost expression of the
omomyc transgene [49]. Hence, the only mechanism by
which tumors can circumvent Omomyc inhibition of Myc
is to “break” the model system. This is an exception that
seems to prove the rule that Myc is obligate for tumor
survival.
These observations strongly support the candidacy of
Myc as a therapeutic target in many, most, or even (given
its universal role in normal and tumor cell proliferation)
all cancers. Although pharmacological inhibition of Myc
currently remains a pipe dream such studies indicate that
there are, indeed, common, essential and functionally
non-degenerate cancer targets. Hopefully, advances in
drug design and implementation will some day soon allow
us to drug the undruggable and offer renewed therapeutic
hope to cancer patients.

cannot be circumvented by adaptation, compensation
or evolution. Finding such targets, should they exist,
remains the most pressing problem in contemporary
translational cancer research. In many ways Myc looks
like it fulfills all the above criteria: it acts as a nonredundant downstream node through which all upstream
oncogenic and mitogenic signals pass, relaying those
signals on the diverse genes that implement the complex
and coordinated process of cell proliferation. It is essential
for effective cell proliferation and, because its actions
appear broadly limited to cell proliferation, the spectrum
of side effects caused by its systemic inhibition is likely
to be limited only to proliferating tissues. Unfortunately,
several factors continue to diminish enthusiasm for
pharmacological targeting of Myc. First, Myc exerts
its manifold effects mostly through protein-protein
interactions, an unfashionable and often difficult class of
biological process to perturb with small molecule drugs,
although recent advances in tethering and macrolide
chemistries now make this more feasible. Second, aberrant
Myc expression in most human cancers is usually not due
to mutation in the Myc gene itself but a consequence
of its induction by ‘upstream’ oncogenic signals. The
therapeutic utility of inhibiting Myc when its aberrant
expression is a consequence, not a cause, of oncogenesis
is unclear. Third, Myc is essential for proliferation and
stem cell compartment maintenance of regenerative adult
tissues such as the gastrointestinal tract, skin and bone
marrow. Hence, blocking Myc function systemically
might trigger unacceptably severe side effects, suppressing
proliferation in those same tissues that are vulnerable
to classical chemo- and radiotherapy. Finally, if Myc is
required solely for cell proliferation, at best its inhibition
is likely to cause tumor cell arrest, not death, and as such
would have limited therapeutic utility. Together, such
concerns have greatly undermined the credibility of Myc
inhibition as an anti-cancer strategy.
Surprisingly, however, the genetic studies in mice in
which Myc function is systemically inhibited [48] offer
us a great deal of reassurance. Although systemic Myc
inhibition induces profound growth suppression in adult
proliferating tissues – effectively stalling proliferation
in regenerative tissues such as intestine, bone marrow,
skin and testis – it is remarkably well tolerated for
extended periods, in great part because Myc inhibition
does not elicit any disruption of tissue integrity. Mice
exhibit no signs of distress and maintain their weight
and normal blood chemistry. Moreover, the side effects
of systemic myc inhibition on all normal tissues are
completely reversible upon restoration of endogenous
Myc function [48]. Yet more surprisingly, given its lack
of toxicity in normal proliferating tissues, Myc inhibition
has an unexpectedly potent cytotoxic impact on tumor
cells, triggering rapid and complete regression of both
K-RasG12D-driven non-small cell lung cancer [48] and
of SV40 large T/small t antigen-driven pancreatic islet
