BACKGROUND: Long-term outcomes after hepatectomy for colorectal liver metastases in relatively young patients
are still unknown. The aim of the current study was to evaluate long-term outcomes in patients 40 years old, and to
compare them with patients >40 years old. METHODS: All consecutive patients who underwent hepatectomy for
colorectal liver metastases at the authors’ hospital between 1990 and 2006 were included in the study. Patients 40
years old were compared with all other patients treated during the same period. Overall survival (OS), progressionfree survival (PFS), and disease-free survival (DFS) rates were determined, and prognostic factors were identified.
RESULTS: In total, 806 patients underwent hepatectomy for colorectal liver metastases, of whom 56 (7%) were aged
40 years. Among the young patients, more colorectal liver metastases were present at diagnosis, and they were
more often diagnosed synchronous with the primary tumor. Five-year OS was 33% in young patients, compared with
51% in older patients (P ¼ .12). Five-year PFS was 2% in young patients, compared with 16% in older patients (P <
.001). DFS rates were comparable between the groups (17% vs 23%, P ¼ .10). At multivariate analysis, age 40 years
was identified as an independent predictor of poor PFS. CONCLUSIONS: In young patients, colorectal liver metastases
seem to be more aggressive, with a trend toward lower OS, more disease recurrences, and a significantly shorter PFS after
hepatectomy. However, DFS rates were comparable between young and older patients, owing to an aggressive multimodality treatment approach, consisting of chemotherapy and repeat surgery. Therefore, physicians should recognize
the poor outcome of colorectal liver metastases in young patients and should consider an aggressive approach to diagnoC 2009 American Cancer Society.

Currently, colorectal cancer is the third most commonly diagnosed cancer and the second leading cause of cancer

death in the United States.1 Although a slight decrease in colorectal cancer incidence has been observed in older patients
during the past few years, its incidence in patients younger than 40 years is rising.2 As >50% of colorectal cancer patients
develop liver metastases during their disease course, surgeons and oncologists will be more often confronted with relatively
young patients presenting with colorectal liver metastases.
Hepatic resection of metastatic colorectal cancer has become the treatment of choice for selected patients, resulting
in 5-year survival rates of around 40%,3-5 with postoperative mortality rates of <5% in most large series.6-9 However,
only 20% of patients with colorectal liver metastases are directly amenable to hepatic surgery.10 Of the remaining patients,
up to 13% can be converted to resectability by the administration of modern chemotherapy regimens.11 In addition, specific surgical techniques such as portal vein embolization,12 vascular reconstruction,13 2-stage procedures,14,15 and local
ablation can further increase the number of resected patients.
Whether these encouraging results differ according to the patient’s age at the time of hepatectomy is still unknown. For
elderly patients, mostly defined as being >70 years old at hepatic resection, 5-year survival rates varying between 21% and
44% have been reported after hepatectomy for colorectal liver metastases.16-20 However, long-term outcomes for young
patients (ie, patients aged 40 years at hepatectomy) who underwent hepatic resection for colorectal liver metastases have
never been evaluated. Nevertheless, a small number of studies have specifically addressed outcomes after resection of the primary colorectal malignancy in patients aged <40 years. Reported 5-year survival rates in recent series ranged between 9% and

54.8%.21-24 In 2 studies, comparison was made to patients
aged >40 years at colorectal resection, and both studies
concluded that long-term outcome of the younger patient
group was similar to that observed for the older
patients.21,24 Whether these results can be extrapolated to
patients scheduled for hepatic resection of colorectal metastases is still unknown. However, young patients often have
better performance status, with fewer comorbidities than
their older counterparts, and therefore can be treated more
aggressively with a combination of chemotherapy and
repeat surgery, which might influence long-term outcomes.
The aim of the current study was to evaluate longterm outcomes after hepatectomy for colorectal liver metastases in young patients treated with an aggressive
approach consisting of chemotherapy and repeat surgery,
and to investigate whether long-term outcome in young
patients differs from that observed in older patients.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study Population
All consecutive patients who underwent hepatic resection
for colorectal metastases at our hospital between January
1990 and January 2006 were included in the study. All
patients were identified in our prospectively maintained
institutional database, and additional information was
obtained by reviewing each patient’s medical record. The
presence of familial colon cancer syndromes was not available in our database. In the current study, patients with an
age at hepatectomy 40 years were considered as young
patients. Young patients were compared with all other
patients who underwent hepatectomy for colorectal metastases during the same period.
Preoperative Management
Before hepatectomy, all patients were evaluated by thoracoabdominal imaging (ultrasonography, computed tomography [CT]), routine blood tests including serum
tumor marker levels, and colonoscopy. In case of initially
unresectable metastatic disease (ie, estimated future remnant liver too small or extrahepatic disease sites unresectable), preoperative chemotherapy was administered, with
the aim of converting these patients to a resectable situation. In addition, patients with initially resectable metastases were treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy when
it concerned synchronous liver metastases (ie, diagnosed
before, during, or within 3 months after colorectal resection) or marginally resectable liver disease (5 bilateral
nodules). Chemotherapy response was evaluated radiolog-

ically after every 4 cycles of treatment, according to World
Health Organization guidelines,25 or more recently,
Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors.26 When
the estimated future remnant liver was judged too small
(<30%), preoperative portal vein embolization was performed to induce compensatory hypertrophy of the
remaining liver, thereby decreasing the risk of postoperative liver insufficiency.12 The decision for surgery was
taken during a multidisciplinary meeting, including surgeons, medical oncologists, and radiologists.
Hepatic Resection
All hepatectomies were performed with curative intent.
First, thorough exploration of the abdominal cavity was performed to rule out unresectable extrahepatic disease. Then,
the extent of liver disease was evaluated by palpation and
intraoperative ultrasound examination of the liver. Radiofrequency ablation or cryotherapy was combined with hepatic
resection to treat up to 3 deeply located lesions in the remnant liver. If >3 lesions would remain in the future remnant
liver, a 2-stage procedure was performed.15,27 When hepatic
resection comprised 3 anatomic segments,28,29 it was
defined as a major hepatectomy. The presence of resectable
extrahepatic disease was not considered a contraindication
for surgery. When extrahepatic metastases were located in
the abdominal cavity, resection was performed immediately.
If extrahepatic disease was located outside the abdomen,
resection was generally performed 2 months to 3 months after hepatectomy, with systemic chemotherapy in between to
reduce the risk of disease progression.
Postoperative Follow-Up
Follow-up after hepatectomy included a history and physical examination, routine blood tests, serum tumor markers,
and liver ultrasound 1 month after surgery and then every
4 months. Every 8 months, CT imaging of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis was performed. Postoperative chemotherapy was routinely recommended to reduce the recurrence
risk. Recurrences (intra- and/or extrahepatic) were resected
only if the overall surgical strategy could be complete.30
Statistical Analysis
Continuous data were compared using the independentsamples t test, and categoric variables were compared
using the chi-square test. Survival probabilities were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method, with the date of
hepatectomy as starting point. Survival curves were compared using the log-rank test. Progression-free survival
was defined as the time interval between hepatectomy and
first postoperative recurrence or death. Disease-free

survival was defined as the time interval between hepatectomy and the first postoperative recurrence that could not
be curatively treated (resection or ablation) or death. Univariate analysis was performed to determine factors related
to overall and progression-free survival using the log-rank
test. To identify independent predictors of overall and
progression-free survival, all factors with an univariate
P < .15 were entered into a Cox proportional hazard
model. All statistical analyses were performed with SPSS
version 13.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, Ill), and statistical significance was determined at P < .05.

our hospital. Of these, 56 (7%) were aged 40 years at
hepatectomy. The remaining 750 (93%) patients were
older than 40 years at the time of hepatectomy.
Primary colorectal tumors were more extensive in
young patients, compared with the older patient group (T
classification 3/431: 96% vs 85%, P ¼ .04). Also, the
mean number of liver metastases at diagnosis was higher
in the young patient group (5  5 vs 3  3, P ¼ .002),
and metastases were more frequently diagnosed synchronous with the primary tumor (82% vs 57%, P < .001)
(Table 1). In addition, liver metastases tended to be more
often bilaterally distributed in the young patient group
(62% vs 51%, P ¼ .11), and concomitant extrahepatic
metastases were more often present in young patients
(29% vs 18%, P ¼ .05). Patient and tumor characteristics
are outlined in Table 1.

Perioperative Details
The number of patients treated by preoperative systemic
chemotherapy did not differ between the groups (young
vs older patients: 84% vs 79%, P ¼ .34) (Table 2). Likewise, the number of patients who received only a single
line of chemotherapy was similar between the groups.
However, the mean number of administered chemotherapy cycles was significantly higher in the young patient
group (12  9 vs 9  5, P ¼ .003).
Before hepatectomy, within the young patient group
portal vein embolization was judged necessary to prevent
postoperative liver insufficiency in only 1 (2%) patient,
compared with 75 (10%) patients in the older patient
group (P ¼ .05). Similar to that observed at the moment
of liver metastases diagnosis, the mean number of intraoperatively detected liver metastases in young patients was
higher than that in the older patient group (4  4 vs 3 
3, P ¼ .02). The rate of major hepatectomies did not differ between the groups (Table 3). Other hepatectomy
characteristics are listed in Table 3.
Within the young patient group, none of the
patients died within 60 days after hepatectomy, compared
with 7 (2%) patients in the older group (P ¼ .32). Thirtyfour percent of the patients in the young patient group
developed a postoperative complication, which was similar to the rate of postoperative complications observed in
the older patients (33%, P ¼ .83). Specific information
concerning postoperative complications is outlined in
Table 3. Postoperatively, 89% of the young patients

650

received systemic chemotherapy, compared with 81% of
the older patients (P ¼ .06).
Long-Term Outcome
The mean follow-up for the entire study population was
39 months. At last follow-up in the young patient group,
29 (52%) patients had died, and 27 (48%) patients were
alive, of whom 9 (16%) were without disease recurrence
(Table 4). Within the older patient group, 301 (40%)
patients had died at last follow-up, and 449 (60%) were
alive, including 214 (29%) without evidence of disease
recurrence.
Within the young patient group, significantly more
patients developed a disease recurrence, compared with
the older patient group (88% vs 69%, P ¼ .003) (Table 4).
However, the location of disease recurrences did not differ
between the groups. In addition, repeat surgery for both
hepatic and extrahepatic recurrences was more often performed in the young patient group (repeat hepatectomy:
50% vs 28%;, P < .001; repeat extrahepatic surgery: 46%
vs 29%, P ¼ .005).
Three-year and 5-year overall survival rates were
59% and 33% in the young patient group, compared
with 65% and 51% in the older patient group (P ¼ .12)
(Fig. 1). Median overall survival for the younger patients
was 43 months, whereas it was 61 months for the older
patients. Three-year and 5-year progression-free survival
rates were significantly lower in the younger patient group
(4% and 2% vs 21% and 16%, P < .001) (Fig. 2).

DISCUSSION
Long-term outcomes after hepatic resection for colorectal
liver metastases in young patients are still unknown. This
was the impetus for the current study, evaluating longCancer

term outcomes in patients 40 years old, which were
compared with patients older than 40 years.
Within the current study, young patients presented with more extensive disease, reflected by a higher
number of metastases, which were more often diagnosed
synchronous with the primary tumor. Furthermore,
overall survival rates tended to be lower in the young
patient group (5-year overall survival rate, 33% vs 51%;
P ¼ .12). Also, young patients more often developed a
disease recurrence (88% vs 69%, P ¼ .003), and progression-free survival in this patient group was significantly lower than that observed for older patients (5year progression-free survival rate, 2% vs 16%; P <
.001). However, as recurrences in young patients were
often treated by repeat surgery, disease-free survival rates
did not differ between the groups. At multivariate analysis, young age independently predicted poor progression-free survival.
The potential influence of age on long-term outcomes after hepatic resection for metastatic colorectal cancer has only been described for elderly patients.16-20
Elderly patients are often defined as patients with an age
at hepatectomy 70 years, and reported 5-year survival
rates for these patients vary between 21% and 44%, which
is similar to that observed for patients younger than 70
years.16-20 Although no data are available concerning
long-term outcomes after hepatectomy for colorectal metastases in relatively young patients, long-term outcomes
after resection of the primary colorectal tumor in patients
younger than 40 years have been described by some
authors.21-24 Five-year overall survival rates in these stud-

ies were highly variable and ranged between 9% and
54.8%.21-24 In 2 of these studies, long-term outcomes
were compared between young and older patients, showing no differences between the groups.21,24 In all of these
studies, an age of 40 years was used to define the young
patient group, and therefore we decided to use the same
cutoff point in the current study. To our knowledge, our
study is the first describing long-term outcomes after hepatic
resection for colorectal metastases in patients 40 years.
The trend to lower overall survival rates after hepatectomy for colorectal metastases in patients aged 40
years was rather surprising. Often, young patients have a
better performance status, with fewer cardiovascular and
pulmonary comorbidities, compared with older patients.
As a result, young patients can in general be treated with
more aggressive preoperative chemotherapy regimens,
and in case of disease recurrence, young patients are more
often candidates for repeat surgery. In the current study,
before hepatectomy young patients were indeed treated
with significantly more cycles of systemic chemotherapy;
however, postoperative mortality and morbidity rates
were comparable between the groups. It is noteworthy
that mean follow-up periods did not differ between the
groups (36 months in the young patient group vs 39
months in the group of older patients, P ¼ .60). Importantly, although a trend to lower overall survival rates was
observed in younger patients, the 5-year survival rate of
33% still compares favorably with that observed with
treatment by chemotherapy alone (5-year overall survival
rate <5%).32

Conversely, the trend toward lower overall survival
rates seems logical. We could hypothesize, even if it is at the
limit of the scope of our study, that younger patients seek
medical attention at a later moment when their disease is already in a more advanced stage. In addition, the difference
between young patients and older patients might also be
because of different mechanisms of carcinogenesis and subsequently, different aggressiveness. In a study performed by
Lin et al, evaluating outcome in patients with colorectal
cancer younger than 40 years, 90% of patients presented
with Dukes C or D tumors at the moment of diagnosis.22
Furthermore, the authors reported a significantly poorer
prognosis for patients with Dukes C or D colorectal malignancies as compared with Dukes B tumors.22 That younger
patients present with colorectal malignancies in a more
advanced disease stage, with more often poorly differentiated tumor grades, was confirmed by 2 recent studies.33,34
In the current study, young patients also presented with

Cancer

February 1, 2010

more extensive disease, which is reflected by the significantly higher proportion of young patients with T classification 3 or 4 primary colorectal tumors, compared with the
older patient group (96% vs 85%; P ¼ .04). Although in
the current study both T and N classification of the primary
colorectal tumor did not impact survival at multivariate
analysis, young patients more often developed a disease recurrence after hepatectomy, indicating that these patients
bear a more aggressive type of metastatic colorectal cancer
than the older patients. The finding that the proportion of
R1 liver resections was slightly higher in the young patient
group should not be considered to have an important
impact on long-term outcomes, as we have recently shown
that patients who underwent an R1 liver resection experienced survival rates similar to those who underwent an R0
resection.35
Besides a trend toward lower overall survival rates, we
found that young patients experienced significantly lower

progression-free survival rates, compared with older
patients after hepatectomy for colorectal liver metastases.
More importantly, an age at hepatectomy 40 years
emerged as an independent predictor of poor progressionfree survival rates. In practice, this means that younger
patients develop disease recurrence at an earlier moment after the initial hepatectomy than their older counterparts.
However, disease-free survival rates were comparable
between the age groups. This can be explained by the higher
rate of repeat surgery (both repeat hepatic and extrahepatic
resections) in the young patient group, thereby increasing
disease-free survival rates, which is illustrated in Figure 4.
In conclusion, a trend toward lower overall survival
rates was observed in patients aged 40 years who underwent hepatic resection for colorectal metastases, compared
with older patients. Similarly, metastatic colorectal cancer
seems to be more aggressive in younger patients, as these

Cancer

February 1, 2010

patients more often developed a disease recurrence, which
occurred after a significantly shorter time interval since
hepatectomy. However, owing to a multimodality treatment approach consisting of chemotherapy and repeat
surgery, comparable disease-free survival rates were
observed in both groups. Therefore, physicians should
recognize the poor outcome of colorectal liver metastases
in young patients and should consider an aggressive
approach to diagnosis and early treatment. In practice, the
possibility of colorectal cancer with or without liver metastases should be considered in the differential diagnosis,
not only in elderly patients but also in relatively young
patients. Furthermore, both oncologists and surgeons
should re-examine their patients after colorectal surgery
with short time intervals and should use modern diagnostic modalities to diagnose liver metastases. In this way, a
multimodality treatment can be started at an earlier stage

of the disease, thereby improving long-term outcomes. In
the future, basic studies should be performed to determine
whether colorectal malignancies differ between young and
older patients on a molecular and/or genetic level.
