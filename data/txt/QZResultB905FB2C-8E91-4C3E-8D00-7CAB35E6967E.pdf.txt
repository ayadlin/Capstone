Abstract
Oncolytic viruses, including oncolytic herpes simplex virus
(oHSV), have produced provocative therapeutic responses in
patients with glioblastoma, the most aggressive brain tumor.
Paradoxically, innate immune responses mediated by natural
killer (NK) cells and macrophages/microglia appear to limit
oHSV efﬁcacy. Therefore, we investigated whether pretreatment with an immunosuppressive cytokine, TGFb, might
reverse these effects and thereby potentiate oHSV efﬁcacy.
TGFb treatment of NK cells rendered them less cytolytic against
oHSV-infected glioblastoma cells and stem-like cells in vitro.
Furthermore, TGFb treatment of NK cells, macrophages, or
microglia increased viral titers of oHSV in cocultures with

glioblastoma cells. In a syngeneic mouse model of glioblastoma, administering TGFb prior to oHSV injection inhibited
intracranial inﬁltration and activation of NK cells and macrophages. Notably, a single administration of TGFb prior to
oHSV therapy was sufﬁcient to phenocopy NK-cell depletion
and suppress tumor growth and prolong survival in both
xenograft and syngeneic models of glioblastoma. Collectively,
our ﬁndings show how administering a single dose of TGFb
prior to oncolytic virus treatment of glioblastoma can transiently inhibit innate immune cells that limit efﬁcacy, thereby
improving therapeutic responses and survival outcomes. Cancer

Introduction

cell lysis while sparing normal cells (3). Importantly, this activity
is also associated with the enhancement of antitumor immune
responses, introducing the potential for extended disease control
(4, 5). Oncolytic herpes simplex viruses (oHSV) have been shown
to be effective for the treatment of various cancers especially
when combined with other reagents, and an oHSV-expressing
granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor has demonstrated improvement in durable response rates with a tolerable
safety proﬁle in phase III malignant melanoma trials (6). Oncolytic viruses have attracted particular attention as distinctive antiglioblastoma biologic agents, due not only to the relatively
restricted localization of glioblastoma in the brain but also to
the fact that the surrounding normal cells are postmitotic and thus
less susceptible to nonselective viral infection and lysis (7).
However, the host innate immune response to oHSV has been
shown to impair efﬁcient virus replication and spread within
tumor tissues following initial infection, which results in compromised therapeutic efﬁcacy of oHSV against glioblastoma
(8, 9). We previously demonstrated that administration of oHSV
in the brain induced rapid recruitment and activation of natural
killer (NK) cells, which substantially increased viral clearance and
limited antitumor efﬁcacy of oHSV in both athymic and immunocompetent mouse models (10). In addition, oHSV-activated
NK cells coordinated macrophage and microglia activation within
tumors, thereby facilitating their viral clearance properties. NKcell depletion prolonged overall survival of glioblastoma-bearing
mice in a xenograft U87DeltaEGFR (U87dEGFR) model and a
syngeneic 4C8 model (10). Suppression of initial innate antiviral
defense responses is thus predicted to augment virus replication
and tumor lysis, prior to eventual tumor clearance by multiple
mechanisms, including later stage host antitumor immune

Glioblastoma is the most common and aggressive primary
brain tumor in adults (1). The current standard treatment for
glioblastoma consists of surgical resection followed by radiotherapy and chemotherapy. However, even with this multipronged
approach, the median overall survival of patients with glioblastoma is only 14.6 months due to the highly inﬁltrative nature of
glioblastoma that prevents effective resection (2). Therefore, there
is an urgent need to develop novel and effective therapies for this
devastating malignancy. Oncolytic viruses are viruses genetically
engineered to selectively replicate in tumor cells and trigger tumor

responses. Therefore, we hypothesized that temporary or transient
inhibition of innate immune responses would enhance the efﬁcacy of oHSV in the treatment of glioblastoma.
The cytokine TGFb is secreted by a variety of cells and can exert
multiple effects, but in general, it produces cell growth inhibition
and apoptosis via transcriptional induction of genes such as the
cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors p15 and p21 (11, 12). Importantly, it plays a critical role in dampening innate immune
responses. The immunosuppressive properties of TGFb motivated
us to explore whether a single pretreatment dose prior to oHSV
treatment can temporarily inhibit the anti-oHSV innate immune
responses to augment anti-glioblastoma efﬁcacy. In the present
study, we found that pretreatment of glioblastoma-bearing mice
with a single dose of TGFb prior to oHSV administration created a
temporary immunosuppressive window that allowed oHSV to
replicate and propagate efﬁciently in the glioblastoma cells,
maximizing anti-glioblastoma therapy efﬁcacy and prolonging
mouse survival.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture
Vero, Gli36dEGFR, and U251 cells were maintained in DMEM
supplemented with 10% FBS. Monkey kidney epithelial derived
Vero cells were obtained in April 2005 from Dr. E Antonio
Chiocca [Ohio State University (OSU), Columbus, OH]. GB30,
GB1123, GB84, and GB157 neurospheres, also from Dr. Chiocca
(received 2012), were maintained as tumor spheres in neurobasal
medium supplemented with 2% B27, human EGF (20 ng/mL),
and bFGF (20 ng/mL) in low-attachment cell culture ﬂasks.
Vero cells have not been authenticated since receipt. Gli36dEGFR, GB30, and U251 cells were authenticated by the University of Arizona Genetics Core via STR proﬁling on January 2015.
Murine BV2 microglia were maintained in DMEM supplemented
with 2% FBS. BV2 cells were obtained in January 2009 from
J. Godbout (OSU). Murine RAW264.7 macrophages, received
in June 2010 from Dr. Susheela Tridandapani (OSU), were
cultured in RPMI supplemented with 10% FBS. Murine BV2 and
RAW264.7 cells have not been authenticated since receipt.
Human NK cell line NK-92 was purchased from ATCC and has
been authenticated with STR proﬁling. Human primary NK cells
were isolated from peripheral blood leukopacks of healthy
donors (American Red Cross, Columbus, OH) as described previously (13). Human NK cells were maintained in RPMI-1640
supplemented with 20% FBS and 150 IU/mL recombinant
human (rh) IL2 (Hoffman-La Roche Inc.). All cells were incubated
at 37 C in an atmosphere with 5% carbon dioxide and maintained
with penicillin (100 U/mL) and streptomycin (100 mg/mL). All
cells are routinely monitored for changes in morphology and
growth rate. All cells are negative for mycoplasma.
All above antibiotics and cytokines were purchased from Invitrogen. TGFb1 was purchased from PeproTech. Pan-TGFb neutralizing antibody 1D11 was purchased from R&D Systems.
Mice
Six- to 8-week-old nude mice, NOD.Cg-Prkdcscid Il2rgtm1Wjl/SzJ
(NSG) mice, and B6D2F1 mice were purchased from Jackson
Laboratories. All animal work was approved by The Ohio State
University Animal Care and Use Committee and carried out
according to an approved protocol. For survival studies, mice
were monitored frequently for glioblastoma disease progression

5274 Cancer Res; 75(24) December 15, 2015

and sacriﬁced when they became moribund with neurologic
impairments and obvious weight loss. For ﬂow cytometric analysis of immunoregulation in the setting of oHSV, unless speciﬁed,
mice were all sacriﬁced two days after oHSV injection, and tissues
were harvested for immune cell isolation. oHSV used in vivo and
in vitro is rQNestin34.5, which was previously described (14).
Cytotoxicity assay
A standard 51Cr release assay was performed as described
previously (15). Brieﬂy, target cells were labeled with 51Cr and
cocultured with the NK-92 cell line or freshly isolated primary NK
cells pretreated with or without TGFb1 at 20 ng/mL for 24 hours at
various effector:target (E:T) ratios in the wells of 96-well V-bottom
plates at 37 C for 8 hours. Glioblastoma cell lines or patientderived glioblastoma stem–like cells as target cells were preincubated with or without oHSV for 30 minutes at 37 C (multiplicity
of infection, MOI ¼ 3). Supernatants were harvested and transferred into scintillation vials containing a liquid scintillation
cocktail (Fisher Scientiﬁc), and the release of 51Cr was measured
on Beckman Liquid Scintillation Counter LS-6500 (Beckman
Coulter). Target cells incubated in complete medium or 1% SDS
were used to determine spontaneous or maximal 51Cr release,
respectively. Percentage of speciﬁc cell lysis was calculated using
the standard formula: 100  (cpm experimental release  cpm
spontaneous release)/(cpm maximal release  cpm spontaneous
release).
Real-time reverse transcription PCR
To detect TNFa, IFNg, and NOS2 mRNA expression in brain
tissues, RNA was extracted from brain samples with the RNeasy
Mini Kit (Qiagen) and quantiﬁed with NanoDrop (Thermo
Fisher). Reverse transcripts were produced using M-MLV reverse
transcriptase (Invitrogen), and real-time PCR was conducted with
SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Life Technologies). The PCR primers
were described previously (10). PCR reaction parameters were
95 C for 10 minutes, 40 cycles at 95 C for 10 seconds, and 60 C
for 60 seconds, followed by 72 C for 10 minutes for ﬁnal
extension.
Coculture virus replication assay
A total of 5  105 U251 cells were seeded in wells of 6-well
plates with 2% FBS medium and incubated at 37 C overnight.
Three milliliter DMEM media supplemented with 0.05% FBS
containing oHSV at an MOI of 3 was added to the wells after
media aspiration and was incubated at 37 C for 20 minutes. After
removal of supernatants and washing with DMEM, the cells (BV2,
RAW264.7 or NK-92 cells) pretreated with TGFb1 or untreated
control cells were added (1  106 cells per well). After incubation
for 12 hours at 37 C, both media and cells were collected for virus
titer assays as reported previously (16).
In vivo testing of TGFb1 effects on oHSV therapy using the
orthotopic human GB30 xenograft model and the 4C8
syngeneic model
GB30 human glioma stem–like cells were retrovirally transduced with Pinco-pGL3-luc/GFP virus expressing ﬁreﬂy luciferase
(FFL). GFP-positive cells were sorted using a FACSAria II cell sorter
(BD Biosciences) and were designated "GB30-FFL" cells. On day
0, 40 nude mice were anesthetized and ﬁxed in a stereotactic
apparatus, a burr hole was drilled 2 mm lateral and 1 mm anterior
to the bregma to a depth of 3.25 mm, and 5  104 GB30-FFL cells

in 2 mL Hank's Buffered Salt Solution (HBSS) were implanted. On
day 7, the mice were divided into four groups. Mice from the
TGFb1 and oHSV combination group were intravenously injected
with TGFb1 (1 mg in 200 mL PBS per mouse). Mice from the
combination of 1D11 and oHSV group were intravenously
injected with 1D11 pan-TGFb neutralizing antibody (5 mg in
200 mL PBS per mouse), and mice from the oHSV-only group
and the HBSS group were intravenously injected with 200 mL PBS.
On day 8, all mice from the TGFb1 and oHSV combination, the
1D11 and oHSV combination, and the oHSV-only groups were
intratumorally injected with 2  105 pfu oHSV in 3 mL HBSS, and
mice from HBSS group were intratumorally injected with 3 mL
HBSS. Mice were monitored daily and euthanized when moribund. Ten days after inoculation of GB30-FFL cells, the mice were
intraperitoneally infused with D-luciferin (150 mg/kg body
weight; Gold Biotechnology), anesthetized with isoﬂurane, and
imaged using In Vivo Imaging System (IVIS-100, PerkinElmer)
and analyzed with live image software (PerkinElmer). For the
syngeneic model, 105 4C8 murine glioma cells were intracranially
injected to each B6D2F1 mouse in the same way as in the GB30FFL model.
NK-cell depletion in GB30-bearing athymic nude mice and
4C8-bearing B6D2F1 mice
Twenty-ﬁve nude mice were intracranially implanted with 5 
104 GB30-FFL cells, as described above, on day 0. On day 8, the
mice in the NK-cell depletion groups (asialo þ oHSV and asialo þ
TGFb þ oHSV) were intraperitoneally injected with 50 mL antiasialo GM1 antibody (Wako) combined with 50 mL distilled
water. The mice in other groups were intraperitoneally injected
with 100 mL distilled water. On day 9, mice in the TGFb þ oHSV
group and the asialo þ TGFb þ oHSV group were intravenously
injected with TGFb1 (1 mg in 200 mL PBS per mouse). Mice in other
groups were intravenously injected with 200 mL PBS. On day 10,
mice in the HBSS group were intratumorally injected with 3 mL
HBSS, the other mice were intratumorally injected with 2  105
pfu oHSV in 3 mL HBSS. Mice were monitored daily and euthanized when moribund. Fourteen days after inoculation of GB30FFL cells, the mice were imaged and analyzed as aforementioned.
Survival data were analyzed only after all mice were euthanized.
For the syngeneic model, 4C8 murine glioma cells were intracranially injected to each B6D2F1 mouse in the same way as in the
GB30-FFL model.
Flow cytometry
Murine mononuclear cells from oHSV-infected brains were
isolated as previously described (17). To obtain splenocytes,
spleens were collected and homogenized through a 70-mm
strainer. Erythrocytes were lysed using RBC lysis buffer (Biolegend). Cells isolated from either brains or spleens were treated
with Fc Block antibody (anti CD16/32, BD Biosciences). Cells
were stained with mouse-speciﬁc immune cell surface markers for
30 minutes at 4 C. The following anti-mouse antibodies were
used at a dilution of 1:200: CD3-APC, NK1.1-PE, CD69-FITC,
CD27-V450, CD11b-PE, CD45-APC, CD3-PE-Cy7, CD107-APC,
CD11b-PerCP-Cy5.5, and IFN-g-FITC (Biolegend). For CD107a
staining, mononuclear cells were cultured in 10% RPMI media
with monensin (eBioscience) for 4 hours before cell surface
staining. For staining of IFNg, we treated the cells with Cytoﬁx/
Cytoperm (BD) following initial cell surface staining and then
performed intracellular staining.

Statistical analysis
Unpaired Student t tests were used to compare two independent groups for continuous endpoints if normally distributed. For
non-normally distributed endpoints, such as the in vivo bioluminescence intensity, a Kruskal–Wallis test was used to compare the
median of experimental groups. For survival analysis, Kaplan–
Meier curves were plotted and compared using a log-rank test.
All tests were two-sided. P values were adjusted for multiple
comparisons using Bonferroni method. P < 0.05 was considered
statistically signiﬁcant.

Results
TGFb1 inhibits NK-92 and primary NK-cell cytotoxicity against
oHSV-infected glioblastoma cells
Our previous study showed that activated NK cells were
recruited to oHSV-treated tumors within hours of infection,
resulting in substantially compromised oHSV-mediated antitumor efﬁcacy (10). Given that TGFb1 is a well-characterized
immunosuppressive factor, we ﬁrst assessed in vitro whether
TGFb1 treatment affects the cytotoxic activity of NK cells against
oHSV-infected glioblastoma cells. We preincubated the NK-92
cell line or primary NK cells with or without TGFb1 for 24 hours
and infected Cr51-labeled patient-derived glioblastoma stem–like
cells or glioblastoma cell lines with or without oHSV for 30
minutes at 37 C. We then combined these cells and assessed
target cell (oHSV-infected or uninfected glioblastoma cells) lysis
by a standard chromium release assay. TGFb1 treatment significantly impaired the cytotoxic activity of primary NK cells against
oHSV-infected or uninfected patient-derived GB30 mesenchymal
and GB157 proneural glioblastoma stem-like cells (Fig. 1A), as
well as two oHSV-infected or uninfected glioblastoma cell lines,
Gli36dEGFR and U251 (Fig. 1B). Similarly, after being pretreated
with TGFb1, NK-92 cells also showed decreased cytotoxic activity
against the oHSV-infected glioblastoma stem–like cells, GB30,
GB1123, GB84, and GB157 (Supplementary Fig. S1A) and the
oHSV-infected glioblastoma cell lines, Gli36dEGFR and U251
(Supplementary Fig. S1B).
TGFb1 treatment enhances oHSV titers in vitro and in vivo in the
presence of glioblastoma cells and innate immune cells
We previously reported that not only NK cells but also macrophages or microglia are recruited to oHSV infection sites to launch
an immune response against oHSV and decrease oHSV replication
(10, 16, 18). We then tested whether TGFb1 pretreatment could
inhibit the antiviral effects mediated by macrophages, microglia,
and/or NK cells in vitro and in vivo. The macrophage cell line RAW
264.7 was preincubated with or without TGFb1 for 24 hours and
then cocultured with oHSV-infected U251 cells for 12 hours,
followed by determination of oHSV titers. In these experiments,
the titer of oHSV was signiﬁcantly increased with TGFb1 pretreatment (Fig. 2A). Similar results were observed using the microglia
cell line BV2 (Fig. 2B) or the NK cell line NK-92 (Fig. 2C). We
next intracranially implanted U87dEGFR cells into nude mice
on day 0. On day 7, the mice were treated with TGFb1 or 1D11
(TGFb neutralizing antibody) by intravenous injection, and on
day 8, oHSV was administered intratumorally. On day 10, the
mice were sacriﬁced and oHSV titers in the inoculated hemispheres were measured as described previously (16). Compared
with the oHSV-only group virus, titers in the hemispheres
from the combination of TGFb1 and oHSV group increased

TGFb1 pretreatment decreases NK cell cytotoxicity against glioblastoma cell lines and patient-derived glioblastoma stem–like cells. A, cytotoxic activity of
primary NK cells or TGFb1-pretreated primary NK cells against oHSV infected or uninfected patient-derived glioblastoma stem–like cells (GB30 and GB157) was
determined using chromium-51 release assay. B, cytotoxic activity of primary NK cells or TGFb1-pretreated primary NK cells against oHSV infected or

signiﬁcantly, but titers in the 1D11 plus oHSV combination group
decreased (Fig. 2D).
Pretreatment with a single dose of TGFb1 decreases NK-cell
intracranial inﬁltration and activation in an
immunocompetent syngeneic glioblastoma mouse model
treated with oHSV
Our previous study showed that NK cells were recruited to the
brain and became activated following oHSV therapy (10). We next
investigated whether there was any change in NK-cell intracranial
inﬁltration and activation after modulation of TGFb signaling in a
syngeneic glioblastoma model. Here, 4C8 murine glioblastoma
cells were implanted into B6D2F1 mice on day 0, followed by an
intravenous injection of TGFb1 or 1D11 on day 7 and an intracranial injection of oHSV or vehicle (HBSS) on day 8 after tumor
cell implantation. Mice receiving oHSV showed a signiﬁcant
increase in inﬁltrating NK cells in the brain relative to mice
receiving vehicle (Fig. 3A). However, pretreatment with TGFb1
resulted in a signiﬁcant decrease in the total number of intracranially inﬁltrating NK cells, whereas pretreatment with 1D11
produced a signiﬁcant increase. We also performed a time course
analysis of TGFb-mediated inhibition of NK-cell inﬁltration after
oHSV injection. The results showed that a single dose of TGFb led

5276 Cancer Res; 75(24) December 15, 2015

to a signiﬁcant inhibition of NK-cell intracranial inﬁltration at
days 1 and 2 after oHSV infection. On day 3, TGFb still produced a
moderate, but not statistically signiﬁcant, inhibitory effect. No
inhibition was observed on and after day 5 (Supplementary Fig.
S2A). We next characterized the activation status of the intracranially recruited NK cells by evaluating NK-cell activation markers.
As expected, oHSV treatment resulted in an increased percentage
of CD27þ NK cells in the brain compared with the HBSS control
group, whereas TGFb1 pretreatment dampened CD27 surface
expression induced by oHSV treatment (Fig. 3B). The percentage
of CD69-expressing NK cells was also signiﬁcantly decreased with
TGFb1 pretreatment in the setting of oHSV therapy (Fig. 3C).
Compared with oHSV treatment alone, expression of CD27 and
CD69 appeared to be increased following 1D11 pretreatment,
although this increase did not reach statistical signiﬁcance. IFNgexpressing NK cells in inoculated hemispheres signiﬁcantly
decreased after TGFb1 pretreatment compared with treatment
with oHSV alone, and increased signiﬁcantly following 1D11
pretreatment compared with treatment with oHSV alone
(Fig. 3D). At the mRNA level, IFN-g gene expression in brain
tissues was signiﬁcantly increased with oHSV treatment (Fig. 3E).
This increase was effectively blocked by TGFb1 pretreatment,
whereas 1D11 pretreatment enhanced it. We then checked the

TGFb1 pretreatment increases oHSV titer in both in vitro coculture system and glioblastoma-bearing nude mice. A, oHSV-infected U251 cells were cocultured
with TGFb1 pretreated or untreated macrophages (RAW 264.7) for 12 hours, and oHSV titer was measured by plaque assay. B, oHSV-infected U251 cells
were cocultured with TGFb1 pretreated or untreated microglia (BV2) for 12 hours, followed by oHSV titer measurement by plaque assay. C, oHSV-infected U251 cells
cocultured with TGFb1-treated or untreated NK-92 cells for 12 hours, followed by oHSV titer measurement by plaque assay. D, twenty-four hours prior
to oHSV injection to the hemisphere of glioblastoma-bearing mice, TGFb1 or 1D11 was administered to the mice through intravenous injection. Two days later,
the hemisphere was harvested and lysed. The lysates were serially diluted and added to Vero cells seeded in 96-well plates to determine viral plaques.

status of NK cells in the spleens to determine whether the
systemic response paralleled the local brain response. We
found that both the percentage of splenic NK cells and expression of the activation/degranulation marker CD107a were
decreased after TGFb1 pretreatment (Supplementary Fig. S3A
and Fig. 3F). Percentages of CD27 and CD69 positive NK cells
in the spleens also decreased signiﬁcantly with TGFb1 pretreatment compared with the oHSV-only group (Supplementary Fig.
S3B). Together, these in vivo assays demonstrate that NK-cell
numbers and activity are compromised by TGFb1 treatment
prior to oHSV therapy, resulting in attenuated NK cell clearance
of oHSV-infected glioblastoma cells.
Macrophages/microglia are suppressed by TGFb1 treatment in
vivo
We then investigated whether TGFb1 pretreatment affected
macrophages/microglia intracranial inﬁltration in the 4C8 syngeneic glioblastoma mouse model treated with oHSV. Indeed, a
signiﬁcant decrease in the percentage of macrophages/microglia
(CD45þCD11bþ) was observed in the brain tissues of mice

receiving TGFb1 in conjunction with oncolytic virus therapy
(Fig. 4A). Consistent with this result, the mRNA expression levels
of two macrophages/microglia activation markers, NOS2 and
TNFa (19), were decreased in tumor-bearing hemispheres after
TGFb1 treatment, whereas the opposite effect was observed in
mice receiving 1D11 (Fig. 4B and C). A similar decrease in the
percentage of macrophages was also detected in spleens from
TGFb1 pretreated mice (Fig. 4D). The time course analysis of
TGFb1-mediated inhibition of macrophages/microglia intracranial inﬁltration in the presence of oHSV was similar to that of
NK cells (Supplementary Fig. S2B)
TGFb1 pretreatment prior to oHSV administration inhibits
glioblastoma tumor growth and prolongs survival of tumorbearing mice in both xenograft and syngeneic models
To further address the potential application of TGFb1 treatment in oHSV therapy, we ﬁrst used the GB30 xenograft
glioblastoma model. Patient-derived GB30 stem–like cells
expressing ﬁreﬂy luciferase were intracranially implanted into
the brains of nude mice. TGFb1 or 1D11 was administered on

HBSS without oHSV or 1D11 prior to oHSV, mice that received
either oHSV alone or TGFb1 prior to oHSV had signiﬁcantly
reduced tumor growth as determined by bioluminescence imaging (Fig. 5A). This reduction in tumor growth was signiﬁcantly
greater in mice pretreated with TGFb1 compared with those
receiving oHSV alone (Fig. 5B). In agreement with these data,

NK-cell innate immune responses, an asialo-GM1 antibody
was injected into athymic mice or B6D2F1 mice to deplete NK
cells prior to TGFb1 treatment, both in our oHSV-treated
GB30 luciferase model and our 4C8 model. As shown
in Fig. 6A and quantiﬁed in Fig. 6B, bioluminescence imaging
data indicated that TGFb1 pretreatment showed effects similar
to asialo-mediated NK-cell depletion. Both NK-cell depletion
and TGFb1 treatment resulted in signiﬁcant improvements in
survival in the presence of oHSV therapy. However, there were
no signiﬁcant differences among TGFb1 treatment, NK-cell
depletion, and their combination in either the GB30 xenograft
model (Fig. 6C) or the 4C8 syngeneic model (Fig. 6D). Also,
virus titers in the hemispheres had no differences among
TGFb1 treatment, NK-cell depletion, and their combination
(Supplementary Fig. S4A). Similar data were observed for
macrophages/microglia intracranial inﬁltration (Supplementary Fig. S4B).

Discussion
In this study, we determined the effect of TGFb in innate
immune responses to oHSV infection. We also characterized
the potential use of TGFb to inhibit innate immune responses
and enhance oHSV therapy for glioblastoma (9, 10, 16). Our
in vitro and in vivo studies demonstrate that TGFb inhibits
NK cell and macrophages/microglia intracranial recruitment,
activation, and function, thereby permitting enhanced oHSV
replication. We demonstrate that the combination of TGFb
with oHSV signiﬁcantly increases the survival of mice in both
syngeneic and xenograft glioblastoma models. The evidence in
this study strongly supports that TGFb regulates innate
immune responses in the setting of oHSV therapy and that
TGFb levels can be therapeutically modulated to enhance
oHSV efﬁcacy.
Oncolytic virus can selectively infect and reproduce in cancer
cells, resulting in cell lysis and virus spread. However, the

recruitment and activation of innate immune cells following
oncolytic virus infection are detrimental to antitumor efﬁcacy.
NK cells, macrophages, and microglia have all been shown to be
deleterious to oHSV replication and spread in tumor cells, as
reported by our group and others (10, 16, 20). Using the potently
immunosuppressive cytokine TGFb, here we demonstrate that
innate immune responses can be temporarily suppressed to
facilitate oHSV replication and spread, thus enhancing antitumor
efﬁcacy of the viruses.
Although the host innate immune response can be detrimental
to oncolytic virus efﬁcacy, this response also possesses an antitumor capacity that can be harnessed for anti-glioblastoma therapy. NK cells can recognize and eliminate tumor cells while
sparing normal "self" cells. Many tumor cells downregulate class
I major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules and/or
upregulate NKG2D ligands, both of which can promote NK-cell
cytotoxicity to these cells (21). Therefore, it is important to
balance the anti-virus and antitumor arms of the host innate
immune response. There is a consensus that TGFb acts as an
immunosuppressive agent in the case of glioblastoma (22). TGFb
not only downregulates the receptor NKG2D on NK cells and on
CD8þ T cells in patients with glioma but also suppresses expression of the ligands for NKG2D on glioma cells (23, 24). On the
basis of this, we pretreated glioblastoma-bearing mice with a
single-dose TGFb before oHSV administration to create a temporary immunosuppressive window that allowed oHSV to replicate
and propagate efﬁciently in glioblastoma cells and maximize
oHSV anti-glioblastoma activity. Our data suggest that TGFb,
used in a proper manner, has the potential to enhance oHSV
efﬁcacy against glioblastoma in the clinical setting.
In addition to tumor cells, tumor-associated macrophage/
microglia in the glioma microenvironment also secrete high levels

5280 Cancer Res; 75(24) December 15, 2015

of TGFb (25). Our data indicate that these levels of TGFb are
insufﬁcient to allow effective viral propagation, although they
likely have a minor positive effect. We found that the inhibition of
basal levels of TGFb in the tumor microenvironment with a panTGFb neutralizing antibody prior to oHSV injection reduced the
efﬁcacy of oHSV therapy. This further supports TGFb as an
important modulator in oHSV efﬁcacy and is consistent with our
data showing that transiently increasing TGFb levels in the tumor
microenvironment enhances oHSV-mediated tumor eradication
and prolongs survival of glioblastoma-bearing mice.
Innate immunity is the ﬁrst line of viral defense, and early
oHSV expansion is thought to be important for antitumor
efﬁcacy. Of note, in our orthotopic glioblastoma model, we
observed signiﬁcant numbers of NK cells and macrophages but
few T and B cells in the brain after the intratumoral injection of
oHSV (10). These results suggest that early immunosuppression of NK cells and macrophages in particular may improve
oHSV therapy. TGFb has the capacity to inhibit multiple types
of innate immune cells, including NK cells, macrophages, and
microglia, presenting an ideal cytokine approach to limit
innate immune response in the setting of oHSV therapy for
glioblastoma. In the GB30 xenograft athymic mouse model,
which lacks an adaptive immunity arm, we found that the
administration of TGFb enhanced oHSV therapy to glioblastoma. However, the role of the adaptive immune response in
oHSV therapy for glioblastoma cannot be examined in this
model. It has been reported that in certain circumstances,
an adaptive immune response to oncolytic virus in the treatment of glioblastoma can occur (26). Importantly, in the
immunocompetent 4C8 glioblastoma mouse model, we still
observed enhanced survival of oHSV and TGFb-treated mice.
These data strengthen our original hypothesis that TGFb is an

excellent agent to enhance oHSV efﬁcacy in the treatment of
glioblastoma.
As with most cancers, a single agent is unlikely to achieve
optimal therapeutic efﬁcacy in glioblastoma. This might be true
when considering the transient suppression of immune responses
to oHSV therapy, where interactions are occurring among tumor
cells, immune cells, and oHSV. Furthermore, as mentioned above,
an adaptive immune response may be also involved in this setting,
especially at later time points. In addition, deﬁning optimal doses
of TGFb1 will also be important, as doses other than 1 mg per
mouse also provide an improved but not optimal efﬁcacy (data
not shown). Thus, reﬁnement of TGFb1 doses and combinations
with other immunosuppressive agents may achieve an optimal
window of immune suppression and further maximize the efﬁcacy of oHSV therapy.
In this study, we used the potent immunosuppressive properties of TGFb to enhance the efﬁcacy of oHSV therapy for
glioblastoma. However, a number of studies have indicated
that endogenous TGFb in tumor microenvironment has a
tumor-promoting role (27, 28). We did not observe a significant tumor-promoting role when TGFb was administered
alone (Supplementary Fig. S5). Our speculation for this paradox is that the tumor-promoting role of TGFb may only be
derived from long-term exposure in the tumor microenvironment rather than a short-term exposure with exogenous TGFb,
as performed here.
In conclusion, we demonstrate that TGFb plays a role in the
interactions among tumor cells, oncolytic virus, and host
immune responses and that modulation of TGFb levels can
be harnessed to improve the efﬁcacy of oncolytic virus therapy.
Further investigation is warranted to explore the clinical application of this novel strategy to improve the efﬁcacy of oncolytic
