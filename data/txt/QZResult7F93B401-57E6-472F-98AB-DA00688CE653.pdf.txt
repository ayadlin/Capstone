Abstract
Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is currently the only major breast tumor subtype without effective
targeted therapy and, as a consequence, in general has a poor outcome. To identify new therapeutic targets in
TNBC, we performed a short hairpin RNA (shRNA) screen for protein kinases commonly ampliﬁed and
overexpressed in breast cancer. Using this approach, we identiﬁed AKT3 as a gene preferentially required for
the growth of TNBCs. Downregulation of Akt3 signiﬁcantly inhibits the growth of TNBC lines in threedimensional (3D) spheroid cultures and in mouse xenograft models, whereas loss of Akt1 or Akt2 have more
modest effects. Akt3 silencing markedly upregulates the p27 cell-cycle inhibitor and this is critical for the ability of
Akt3 to inhibit spheroid growth. In contrast with Akt1, Akt3 silencing results in only a minor enhancement of
migration and does not promote invasion. Depletion of Akt3 in TNBC sensitizes cells to the pan-Akt inhibitor
GSK690693. These results imply that Akt3 has a speciﬁc function in TNBCs; thus, its therapeutic targeting may
provide a new treatment option for this tumor subtype. Cancer Res; 74(3); 964–73. 2013 AACR.

Introduction
Breast cancer is the most common cancer among women
worldwide. On the basis of the gene expression proﬁling, this
disease is categorized into three major subtypes: luminal,
HER2þ/estrogen receptor–negative (ER), and basal-like (1).
Recent developments in endocrine therapy for the treatment of
luminal breast cancer and Her2 targeted therapy, such as
trastuzumab for HER2þ/ER tumors, have led to improved
survival for a subset of patients with breast cancer (2–4).
However, the basal-like subtype, which comprises approximately 15% of invasive breast cancers and is generally triplenegative [ER, progesterone receptor–negative (PR), and
HER2], lacks targeted therapy (5, 6). Currently, chemotherapy
is the only option for the treatment of triple-negative breast
cancers (TNBC), but its clinical beneﬁt is limited to a subset of
patients. Because of poor prognosis and a more aggressive
phenotype, there is an urgent clinical need to identify novel
therapeutic targets for TNBCs.
Akt is a key regulator of numerous cellular phenotypes
associated with cancer, including cell survival, proliferation,

and metastasis (7). Hyperactivation of Akt due to mutations in
the PIK3CA, the catalytic subunit of the p110a subunit of
phosphoinositide 3-kinase, PTEN loss, INPP4B loss, or HER2
ampliﬁcation are common features of many tumors (8, 9). The
three mammalian Akt isoforms (Akt1, Akt2, and Akt3) are
encoded by distinct genes, have high sequence similarity and
are activated by near-identical mechanisms (10, 11). The
critical role of Akt in modulating cancer cell survival and
growth has been well characterized (12). However, the role
played by individual Akt isoforms in different molecular subtypes of breast cancer has not been extensively evaluated. In
particular, it is not known whether a speciﬁc Akt isoform plays
a predominant role in TNBC. In the context of breast cancer
invasion and metastasis, Akt isoforms have nonredundant
roles whereby Akt1 inhibits invasion and metastasis, yet Akt2
promotes these phenotypes both in vitro and in mouse models
of breast cancer progression (11–14). Akt3 is arguably the least
studied isoform, and its function in breast cancer cell proliferation, survival, and migration is not known. Nevertheless,
isoform-speciﬁc functions of Akt3 have been evaluated, especially in knockout mice in which the brain size of Akt3 null mice
is reduced (15, 16). Akt3 has a putative oncogenic function is
supported by the observation that it is overexpressed with high
enzymatic activity in ER breast cancer cells (17). This agrees
with the analysis by The Cancer Genome Atlas Project (TCGA)
that has reported upregulation of AKT3 expression in 28% of
TNBCs (5). The recent identiﬁcation of somatic mutations of
AKT3, including MAGI3–Akt3 and Akt3E17K, in different cancers also points to an important role of this isoform in
tumorigenesis (18, 19). However, a causal role for Akt3 in
breast cancer initiation and growth has not been examined.
Here, we report that Akt3 is a critical regulator of the growth
of TNBCs. Downregulation of Akt3 using short hairpin RNA
(shRNA) inhibits tumor spheroid growth in three-dimensional
(3D) as well as in xenografts. Akt3 depletion is accompanied by

robust upregulation of the cell-cycle inhibitor p27. Silencing
p27 rescues spheroid growth inhibition mediated by Akt3
depletion, indicating that Akt3 modulates tumor growth, at
least in part, via p27. These ﬁndings point to a previously
underappreciated isoform-selective role for Akt3 in the tumorigenesis of TNBC, and demonstrate that inhibition of Akt3speciﬁc signaling might be exploited for therapeutic purposes.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture
MCF7, MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-468, T47D, Hs578T, and
HEK293T cells were obtained from American Type Culture
Collection (ATCC) and maintained in Dulbecco's Modiﬁed
Eagle Medium (DMEM; Cellgro) supplemented with 10% FBS
(HyClone). SKBR3 and MDA-MB-453 cells obtained from ATCC
were cultured in McCoy's 5A medium (Cambrex) supplemented with 10% FBS. BT-549 cells obtained from ATCC were
grown in RPMI-1640 medium supplemented with 10% FBS.
SUM-159-PT cells were cultured in Ham's F12 medium (Cellgro) supplemented with 5% FBS, 1 mg/mL hydrocortisone
(Sigma-Aldrich), and 5 mg/mL insulin (Sigma-Aldrich). ZR75-30 and BT474 cells obtained from ATCC were cultured in
RPMI-1640 medium (Cambrex) supplemented with 10% FBS
and 10 mg/mL insulin. MCF10DCIS.com (20) were grown in
DMEM/Ham's F12 medium supplemented with 5% equine
serum (Gibco-BRL), 10 mg/mL insulin, 500 ng/mL hydrocortisone (Sigma-Aldrich), 20 ng/mL EGF (R&D Systems), and 100
ng/mL cholera toxin (Sigma-Aldrich). All cell lines obtained
from the cell banks listed above are tested for authentication
using short tandem repeat proﬁling and passaged for fewer
than 6 months, and routinely assayed for mycoplasma
contamination.
3D cultures
3D cultures were prepared as previously described (21).
Brieﬂy, chamber slides were coated with growth factor–
reduced Matrigel (BD Biosciences) and allowed to solidify for
30 minutes. About 4,000 MCF10DCIS or MDA-MB-231 cells in
assay medium were seeded on coated chamber slides. Assay
medium for MCF10DCIS contains DMEM/Ham's F12 supplemented with 2% equine serum, 10 mg/mL insulin, 500 ng/mL
hydrocortisone, 5 ng/mL EGF, 100 ng/mL cholera toxin,
2 mg/mL puromycin, and 2% Matrigel. MDA-MB-231 assay
medium contains DMEM supplemented with 2% tet system
approved FBS (Clontech) and 5% Matrigel. The assay medium
was replaced every 4 days. About 100 ng/mL doxycycline was
added every 2 or 3 days.
Antibodies
Anti-Akt1 monoclonal antibody (mAb), anti-Akt2 mAb, antiAkt3 mAb, anti-phospho-Akt S473 (pAkt) mAb, and anti-p27
mAb were obtained from Cell Signaling Technology. Antib-actin mAb was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Anti-bromodeoxyuridine (BrdUrd) mAb was obtained from Roche. Antip85 polyclonal antibody was generated in house and has been
described previously (22). Horseradish peroxidase (HRP)–conjugated anti-mouse and anti-rabbit immunoglobulin G antibody were purchased from Chemicon.

RNA interference
For doxycycline-inducible shRNA-mediated knockdown of
Akt isoforms, a set of single-stranded oligonucleotides encoding the Akt1, Akt2, and Akt3 target shRNA and its complement
were synthesized. The hairpin sequences have been validated
previously (11). Akt1, sense, 50 -CCGGGAGTTTGAGTACCTGAAGCTGCTCGAGCAGCTTCAGGTACTCAAACTCTTTTTG30 ; Akt2, sense, 50 -CCGGGCGTGGTGAATACATCAAGACCTCGAGGTCTTGATGTATTCACCACGCTTTTTG-30 ; and Akt3,
sense, 50 -CCGGCTGCCTTGGACTATCTACATTCTCGAGAATGTAGATAGTCCAAGGCAGTTTTTG-30 . The oligonucleotide
sense and antisense pair was annealed and inserted into teton pLKO. To produce lentiviral supernatants, 293T cells were
cotransfected with control or shRNA-containing tet-on pLKO
vectors, vesicular stomatitis virus G glycoprotein, and psPAX2
for 48 hours. p27 shRNA sequence (sense, 50 -CCGGAAGTACGAGTGGCAAGAGGTGCTCGAGCACCTCTTGCCACTCGTACTTTTTTTG-30 ) previously validated (23) was cloned into
the tet-on pLKO lentiviral expression system as described above.
Cells stably expressing doxycycline-inducible shRNA were cultured in medium containing puromycin (0.5–2 mg/mL) Gene
knockdown was induced by incubating cells with 100 ng/mL
doxycycline for 48 to 72 hours.
Plasmids
For doxycycline-inducible overexpression of Akt3, HA–
Akt3/pTRIPZ was constructed. HA–Akt3 cDNA was ampliﬁed
by PCR from HA–Akt3/pcDNA3. The resulting PCR product
was digested with restriction enzymes AgeI and ClaI, followed
by insertion into pTRIPZ lentiviral vector (Thermo Scientiﬁc).
shRNA screen
Screening was performed as described previously (24).
Brieﬂy, cells were infected with a library of lentiviral shRNAs
directed against 26 human kinases commonly gained and
overexpressed in breast cancer. Infected cells were selected
for puromycin resistance, and cultured for 6 days. Cell viability/
proliferation was assessed using CellTiter-Glo (Promega). Suppression of growth was deﬁned as the capacity for at least two
clones of shRNA targeting the same gene to decreased proliferation by 30% compared with control.
Xenograft studies
Female nude mice (6–8-week-old) were purchased from
Taconic and maintained and treated under speciﬁc pathogenfree conditions. All procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at Dana-Farber Cancer
Institute (Boston, Massachusetts) and conform to the federal
guidelines for the care and maintenance of laboratory animals.
The mice were injected subcutaneously with 1  105 MCF10DCIS
or 2  106 MDA-MB-468 cells in media with 50% Matrigel. The
mice were randomly divided into control and treatment groups
and treated with water supplemented with 1 mg/mL doxycycline
and 2% sucrose or standard water supply. Tumor formation was
examined every 2 to 3 days for the whole duration of the
experiment. One hour before tumor harvesting, BrdUrd was
injected intraperitoneally to assess cell proliferation. Tumors
were harvested and weighed at the experimental endpoint.

Immunohistochemistry of formalin-ﬁxed parafﬁnembedded xenograft tumors
Xenograft tumors were deparafﬁnized in xylene and hydrated in a series of ethanol. After heat-induced antigen retrieval in
citrate buffer (pH 6), the samples were blocked with donkey
serum. Slides were then incubated with primary antibodies for
overnight at 4 C. Samples were washed three times with TBS
followed by incubation with biotinylated secondary antibodies
for 1 hour. The slides were washed and developed using the
3,30 -Diaminobenzidine Metal Enhanced Kit (Vector Labs) and
counter-stained with hematoxylin.
Transwell migration assays
A total of 1  105 cells in serum-free medium containing
0.1% bovine serum albumin were added to the upper chambers
in triplicate. NIH 3T3 cell–conditioned medium was added to
the lower chambers. After 2 to 16 hours of incubation at 37 C,
nonmigrated cells on Transwell ﬁlters (8 mm pore size; Corning) were removed. Cells that had migrated to the bottom of the
ﬁlters were ﬁxed and stained using the Hema-3 stain set
(Protocol).
Cell viability assays
MDA-MB-231 and SKBR3 cells were seeded 24 hours before
inhibitor treatment into 96-well plates at density of 2,000 to
4,000 cells per well in 100 mL medium. Cell viability was
measured 72 hours after inhibitor treatment using the water
soluble tetrazolium salt (WST)-1 assay (Clontech) according to
the manufacturer's protocol.
Quantitative real-time PCR
Total RNA was isolated with TRizol (Invitrogen) according
to the manufacturer's protocol. Reverse transcription was
performed using random hexamers and multiscribe reverse
transcriptase (Applied Biosystems). Quantitative real-time
PCR was performed using an ABI Prism 7700 sequence detector. Akt isoform–speciﬁc primers have been validated previously (25). Akt1 primer: sense, 50 -CAAGCCCAAGCACCGC-30 ;
Akt2 primer: sense, 50 -GCAAGGCACGGGCTAAAG-30 ; and
Akt3 primer: sense, 50 -GAAGAGGAGAGAATGAATTGTAGTCCA-30 . PCR reactions were carried out in triplicate. Quantiﬁcation of mRNA expression was calculated by the dCT
method with glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase as
the reference gene.
Immunoblots
Cells were washed with PBS at 4 C and lysed in radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer (1% NP-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 150 mmol/L NaCl, 50 mmol/L Tris–HCl
(pH 7.5), proteinase inhibitor cocktail, 50 nmol/L calyculin, 1
mmol/L sodium pyrophosphate, and 20 mmol/L sodium ﬂuoride) for 15 minutes at 4 C. Cell extracts were precleared by
centrifugation at 13,000 rpm for 10 minutes at 4 C and protein
concentration was measured with Bio-Rad protein assay reagent
using a Beckman Coulter DU-800 machine. Lysates were then
resolved on 10% acrylamide gels by SDS–PAGE and transferred
electrophoretically to nitrocellulose membrane (Bio-Rad) at
100 V for 60 minutes. The blots were blocked in Tris-buffered
saline (TBST) buffer (10 mmol/L Tris–HCl, pH 8, 150 mmol/L

NaCl, and 0.2% Tween 20) containing 5% (w/v) nonfat dry milk
for 30 minutes, and then incubated with the speciﬁc primary
antibody diluted in blocking buffer at 4 C overnight. Membranes
were washed three times in TBST, and incubated with HRPconjugated secondary antibody for 1 hour at room temperature.
Membranes were washed three times and developed using
enhanced chemiluminescence substrate (Pierce).
Survival analyses in clinical cohorts of TNBC
To determine the association of AKT3 mRNA expression
with patient survival, we used two publicly available clinically
annotated breast cancer gene expression datasets. The ﬁrst is a
published gene expression microarray (GEM) meta-dataset
that integrates gene expression and survival data from a total
of 19 published studies, including a total of 2,731 patients, as
described in ref. 26. Of note, 527 of these patients were
molecularly subtyped using the three-gene model of (27) as
ER/HER2. Given that true PR expression is not observed in
ER breast cancer (28), this group is representative of TNBC.
To assess the association of AKT3 expression with survival
among these patients with ER/HER2 breast cancer, we
performed a Cox proportional hazards analysis. To assess the
association of a binary AKT3 expression score with survival, we
thresholded the AKT3 expression at the TNBC population
median and plotted Kaplan–Meier curves in AKT3-high
expressing versus ATK3-low expressing tumors. We assessed
the signiﬁcance in difference between survival curves by
performing a log-rank test. We performed a similar set of
analyses on the METABRIC dataset, which is composed of a
total of approximately 2,000 breast cancer cases with clinical
follow-up, as described in ref. 29. Pathologic data for ER, PR,
and HER2 expression were available for this cohort, and based
on these data we identiﬁed 319 patients with TNBC. The
METABRIC dataset contained four probes for the AKT3 mRNA.
For each probe, we performed Cox proportional hazards
analysis to overall survival. To assess the association of a
binary AKT3 expression score with survival, we computed the
mean AKT3 expression for each patient and thresholded the
mean AKT3 expression score at the TNBC population median.
We plotted Kaplan–Meier curves in AKT3-high expressing
versus AKT3-low expressing tumors and performed a log-rank
test to assess differences in the curves.

Results
Overexpression of Akt3 in TNBC
To identify genes that are necessary for growth of TNBC, we
screened a panel of 17 commonly studied breast cancer lines as
well as two triple-negative nontumorigenic, immortalized
mammary epithelial lines (MCF-10A and MCF-12A) with a
library of lentiviral shRNAs targeting 26 protein kinases ampliﬁed in breast tumors. Akt3 was found to be one candidate gene
that was preferentially required for TNBC growth. In 10 of 10
TNBC lines tested (including both mesenchymal and basal-like
subtypes), Akt3 depletion leads to growth inhibition (Fig. 1A).
In contrast, proliferation is inhibited in only 3 of 9 luminal
cancer lines transduced with Akt3 shRNA (P for difference in
proportions ¼ 0.009). To investigate whether there is a correlation between Akt3 expression and breast tumor subtypes, we

analyzed a dataset of breast cancer from TCGA (n ¼ 825).
Samples with Akt3 ampliﬁcation have an overrepresentation in
the TNBC subtype (14%) and an underrepresentation in luminal tumors (3%; Fig. 1B). In addition, whereas Akt3 mRNA is
upregulated in 2% luminal breast tumors, its expression is
signiﬁcantly higher in 21% of TNBCs. To determine whether
this is also observed in breast cancer cell lines, we quantiﬁed
mRNA levels for individual Akt isoforms. Although all cell lines
tested express Akt1 and Akt2, Akt3 is exclusively expressed in
TNBC lines (Fig. 1C). Correspondingly, 5 of 5 triple-negative
lines express Akt3 at the protein level as observed by immunoblot analysis, whereas only one of the tested luminal lines
shows detectable Akt3 expression (T47D; Fig. 1D).

described previously (26). The second analysis was performed
on the full METABRIC dataset, which is composed of a total of

provides no evidence to suggest that AKT3 mRNA expression
levels are an important predictor of survival in TNBC (Supplementary Fig. S1). However, mRNA expression levels may

show poor correlation with levels of activated Akt3, and thus
may be poor markers of pathway activation. Thus, to deﬁnitely
determine the association of Akt3 signaling with patient
survival, it will be important to perform analyses assessing
the relationship between phosphorylated/activated Akt3 and
patient survival on large clinical cohorts. These data are
currently unavailable from public databases of clinically annotated molecular proﬁling data in breast cancer.
Akt3 depletion potently inhibits breast tumor spheroid
growth and sensitizes TNBC to an Akt inhibitor
To explore the function of Akt3 in TNBC, we generated a
panel of breast cancer lines with tet-on doxycycline-inducible
Akt1, Akt2, or Akt3 shRNA. Upon doxycycline administration,
Akt isoforms are depleted speciﬁcally and quantitatively
(Fig. 2A). We investigated the consequence of Akt3 silencing
on tumor spheroid growth using a 3D culture system in vitro
that more accurately recapitulates phenotypes that govern

tumor growth in vivo. Depletion of Akt3 in MDA-MB-231 cells
potently inhibits spheroid growth (Fig. 2B), resulting in a 57%
reduction of spheroid size (Fig. 2C). In contrast, the effect of
Akt1 or Akt2 depletion on spheroid growth is much more
modest. A 26% reduction in spheroid size is observed in Akt2depleted cells, whereas there is no signiﬁcant change in
spheroid size when Akt1 is silenced. Knockdown of Akt3 in
another triple-negative line, MCF10DCIS, cloned from a xenograft lesion formed by premalignant MCF-10AT cells and has
the oncogenic mutation H1047R in the p110a catalytic subunit
(PIK3CA; ref. 30), has similar effect on the inhibition of spheroid
growth (56% reduction; Fig. 2D). Conversely, depletion of Akt1
or Akt2 has minimal effect on the growth of spheroids. These
data suggest that Akt3 has a selective role in promoting tumor
spheroid growth of TNBCs.
Data from a recent study have demonstrated that the
majority of TNBC are resistant to the pan-Akt inhibitor
GDC-0068 (31). Because most of the TNBC lines tested express

Akt3 in Triple-Negative Breast Cancer

Akt3, we next determined whether Akt3 loss in TNBC might
result in increased sensitivity to Akt inhibition. Although MDAMB-231 cells are resistant to the ATP-competitive inhibitor
GSK690693 (IC50: 24.2 mmol/L), loss of Akt3 results in a 6-fold
decrease in IC50 (3.8 mmol/L; P < 0.0001; Fig. 2E). Similarly, Akt3
depletion in MCF10DCIS cells leads to a 28-fold decrease in
IC50 (0.54 vs. 15.4 mmol/L in control cells; P < 0.0001; data not
shown). To further determine the role of Akt3 in drug sensitivity, we overexpressed Akt3 in a luminal breast cancer line,
SKBR3, which does not express this Akt isoform. Overexpression of Akt3 results in a 2.7-fold increase in IC50 for GSK690693
compared with control cells (13.4 vs. 5 mmol/L in control cells;
P < 0.05; Fig. 2F). Together, these data indicate that Akt3 plays
an important role in conferring resistance to pan-Akt inhibitors in TNBCs.
p27 is a key regulator of cell-cycle progression. Studies have
shown that Akt inhibits p27 expression via the transcription
factor forkhead box O (32). Moreover, phosphorylation by Akt
has been shown to promote the proteasomal degradation of
p27 (33), thereby regulating its expression at both the transcriptional and posttranslational level. However, it is not
known whether p27 is regulated redundantly by all Akt isoforms, or whether speciﬁcity exists. In this context, in
MCF10DCIS cells Akt1 silencing results in increased p27
protein expression (Fig. 3A), whereas p27 levels are diminished
upon Akt2 silencing. Interestingly, p27 is signiﬁcantly elevated
in Akt3-depleted cells. Similar results are observed in two other

TNBC lines, MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 (Fig. 3A). To
determine whether Akt3 promotes tumor cell proliferation by
modulating p27 expression levels, we performed a rescue
experiment by silencing p27. As shown in Fig. 3B, approximately 50% of p27 is depleted by speciﬁc shRNA. Downregulation of p27 alone has minimal effect on 3D spheroid growth
(Fig. 3C). In contrast, Akt3 shRNA–mediated spheroid growth
inhibition is completely rescued by p27 silencing, indicating
that the effect of Akt3 on tumor spheroid growth is mediated,
at least in part, by p27.
Role of Akt isoforms in modulating invasiveness of tumor
spheroids
We and others have shown that Akt1 and Akt2 have opposing functions in regulating breast cancer cell invasion and
metastasis (12). However, a functional role for Akt3 in modulating cancer cell migration has not been evaluated. To assess
chemotactic cell migration, Transwell migration assays were
performed. In three TNBC lines (MCF10DCIS, MDA-MB-468,
and BT-549), Akt1 and Akt2 silencing leads to increased and
decreased cell migration, respectively (Fig. 4A), in agreement
with published studies. A statistically signiﬁcant but modest
enhancement of migration is observed upon Akt3 silencing in
all three lines. Furthermore, Akt1 silencing promotes an
abnormal branching morphology with cells protruding into
Matrigel (Fig. 4B). In contrast, spheroids remain round and
uniform when Akt2 or Akt3 is depleted. These results indicate

Figure 3. p27 is a downstream
effector of Akt3 in regulating tumor
spheroid growth. A, MCF10DCIS
and MDA-MB-468 cells expressing
tet-on Akt isoform shRNA were

that Akt3 plays a critical role in modulating tumor spheroid
growth in the absence of signiﬁcant effects on breast cancer
cell invasive migration.
Akt3 downregulation attenuates breast tumor growth
in vivo
Next, we evaluated the contribution of Akt3 to tumorigenesis in vivo. Because Akt3 selectively inhibits tumor spheroid
growth of TNBC lines, MDA-MB-468 cells stably expressing teton Akt1, Akt2, and Akt3 shRNA were injected subcutaneously
into nude mice. When Akt3 is depleted by inducing shRNA
expression via doxycycline in drinking water, there is a significant reduction in tumor growth (Fig. 5A). In striking contrast,
silencing Akt1 or Akt2 has no signiﬁcant effect on tumor
growth. To conﬁrm the knockdown of Akt isoforms and to
assess their effect on cell proliferation as well as p27 expression, immunohistochemistry (IHC) was performed on xenografts harvested at the end of the study. Akt protein levels are
dramatically reduced in doxycycline-treated tumors when
compared with their vehicle-treated counterparts (Fig. 5B).
Depletion of Akt3, but not Akt1 or Akt2, is concomitant with a
signiﬁcant reduction in BrdUrd staining, consistent with the

970

Cancer Res; 74(3) February 1, 2014

notion that Akt3 plays a critical role in tumor cell proliferation
in vivo. Similar to what is observed with the in vitro analysis,
depletion of Akt3, but not Akt1 or Akt2, leads to a marked
elevation of p27 expression. Interestingly, silencing of either
Akt1 or Akt3 markedly reduces tumor growth in a distinct
triple-negative line, MCF10DCIS (Fig. 5C). The more marked
effect of Akt1 on MCF10DCIS tumor growth in vivo compared
with in vitro could be due to paracrine function of Akt1 in the
tumor-associated stroma and microenvironment (12). Doxycycline itself has no effect on tumor growth because the growth
of tumors containing empty vector in the absence of doxycycline is indistinguishable from doxycycline-treated tumors
(Fig. 5C). Similar to what is observed in MDA-MB-468 cells,
silencing Akt3, but not Akt1 or Akt2, leads to robust upregulation of p27 expression (Fig. 5D). Taken together, these data
demonstrate that TNBC growth can be inhibited by silencing
Akt3 alone.

Discussion
TNBCs are especially aggressive and have a relatively poor
prognosis compared with other breast tumor subtypes. In the
present study, we set out to identify molecular targets of TNBC

with therapeutic potential using an RNAi functional genetic
screen. We ﬁnd that Akt3 silencing preferentially inhibits the
proliferation of TNBC cell lines both in vitro and in xenografts.
Consistent with this, Akt3 is overexpressed in 21% and 2% of
triple-negative and luminal breast tumors, respectively. To
determine the contribution of individual Akt isoforms in
triple-negative tumor growth, we used an inducible shRNA
strategy. Silencing Akt3, but not Akt1 or Akt2, dramatically
reduces tumor spheroid growth in 3D. The selective effect of
Akt3 in triple-negative tumor is noteworthy because it has been
largely assumed that Akt isoforms play redundant roles in
regulating tumor proliferation and growth. Furthermore, an
isoform-speciﬁc function of Akt3 in any cancer context has not
yet demonstrated. In breast cancer, published studies have
focused on the opposing functions of Akt1 and Akt2 on cell
migration and invasion. Several downstream Akt targets have
been shown to contribute to the differential functions of these

two isoforms in motility, including palladin, nuclear factor of
activated T cells, tuberous sclerosis complex 2, and b1 integrins
(34–37). In this study, we ﬁnd that although Akt3 is required for
TNBC proliferation and tumor growth, unlike Akt1 it does not
promote an invasive phenotype. These ﬁndings have signiﬁcant implications for targeted therapeutics, because currently
all Akt small molecule inhibitors in phase I and II clinical trials
are not isoform selective. One prediction is that pan Akt
inhibitors could have undesired clinical effects by actually
promoting invasion and even metastasis, because Akt1 has
been shown to have both and antiinvasive and antimetastatic
activity in vivo. In contrast, targeting Akt3 exclusively in TNBCs
may have the advantage of inhibiting tumor growth without
any signiﬁcant impact on metastatic dissemination. Furthermore, due to the critical roles of Akt isoforms in tissue
homeostasis, pan-Akt inhibitors are expected to be dose
limiting. Instead, we would argue that isoform-speciﬁc

inhibitors, including Akt3-speciﬁc drugs, would likely have less
associated toxicity and provide a better therapeutic window.
Further support for the need to develop Akt3-speciﬁc inhibitors for the therapeutic targeting of TNBC tumors comes
from a recent study on the sensitivities of different breast
cancer lines to the pan-Akt inhibitor GDC-0068 (31). Of all
luminal lines tested in this study, 5 of 6 lines are sensitive to
GDC-0068 with an IC50 < 2 mmol/L. In agreement with our
expression analysis, most of these lines have undetectable
levels of Akt3. In contrast, 5 of 5 TNBC lines tested express
Akt3, and 3 of them are insensitive to GDC-0068 (MDA-MB-468,
MDA-MB-231, and MCF10A: IC50 > 10 mmol/L; BT-549: IC50 5.6
mmol/L; Hs578T IC50 2.2 mmol/L). Consistent with this, we
show that MDA-MB-231 and MCF10DCIS cells are resistant to
the pan-Akt inhibitor GSK690693. Importantly, Akt3 depletion
in both lines resulted in robust sensitization to the drug,
suggesting a critical role of Akt3 in conferring resistance to
pan-Akt inhibitor in TNBCs. It will be interesting to determine
whether there is a correlation between Akt3 expression and
sensitivity to pan-Akt inhibitors in clinical samples.
On the basis of the gene expression signatures, seven
distinct subtypes of TNBC have been proposed, with a
classiﬁcation that comprises two basal-like, immunomodulatory, mesenchymal, mesenchymal stem-like (MSL), and
luminal androgen receptor subtypes (38). Recent reports
indicated that different subtypes of TNBCs may respond
differently to targeted and chemotherapies (39). Our data
point to a distinct function of Akt3 in MDA-MB-468 and
MDA-MB-231 breast cancer lines, which belong to the basallike 1 and MSL subtype, respectively. Future studies warrant
evaluating the impact of Akt isoform–speciﬁc signaling in
the various proposed TNBC subtypes.
Our study has also uncovered distinct roles of Akt isoforms in the regulation of p27. It has been shown that Akt is
a negative regulator of p27. Here, we demonstrate that Akt2,
in contrast with Akt1, positively regulates p27 expression.
Surprisingly, silencing Akt3 results in a robust elevation of
p27 expression concomitant with inhibition of the growth of
TNBC lines in vitro as well as in xenografts. Using an shRNA
rescue strategy, we show that p27 plays a critical function in
the regulation of tumor spheroid growth mediated by Akt3.
These ﬁndings not only lend further support to the notion of
nonredundant functions of Akt isoforms at the molecular
level, they also suggest the potential use of p27 as a biomarker of Akt3 activity.

Depletion of Akt3 alone inhibits MCF10DCIS and MDA-MB468 xenograft tumor growth. Interestingly, although Akt1 has
minimal effect in modulating spheroid growth, silencing Akt1
in MCF10DCIS in xenografts leads to a reduction of tumor
growth comparable with that observed with Akt3 depletion.
This is likely due to the functional importance of Akt1 signaling
in the tumor-associated stroma because this isoform plays an
important role in promoting VEGF-mediated angiogenesis
(40). Whether angiogenesis contributes to the effect of Akt1
on MCF10DCIS growth in our model remains to be determined.
In conclusion, our studies demonstrate that targeting Akt3
and downstream signaling may be an effective approach to
inhibit growth of TNBC. Because Akt3-speciﬁc inhibitors have
yet to be developed, we propose that the development of such
inhibitors could constitute the basis for Akt3 as a novel target
for single agent or combination therapy.
