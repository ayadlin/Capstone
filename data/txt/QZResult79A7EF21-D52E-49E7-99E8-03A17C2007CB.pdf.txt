BACKGROUND: In clinical trials, combined 5-fluorouracil (5FU) plus oxaliplatin improves the survival of patients who have resected,
stage III colon cancer with manageable toxicity. However, the tolerability of this in the general population of patients with colon
cancer is uncertain. METHODS: Adverse outcomes were compared in patients with stage III colon cancer who received either 5FU or
5FU/oxaliplatin within 120 days of undergoing resection versus a control group of patients with stage II colon cancer who did not
receive chemotherapy in the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER)-Medicare database and in data from the New York
State Cancer Registry linked to Medicare and Medicaid. Hospitalizations, emergency room (ER) visits, and outpatient adverse
events (AEs) were measured in claims from 30 days to 9 months after patients underwent resection. Multiple logistic regression was
used to calculate adjusted odds ratios of events by treatment. Propensity score matching was used to minimize selection bias.
RESULTS: Adverse outcomes were more frequent for chemotherapy recipients. AE rates were higher in patients who received
5FU/oxaliplatin (81%) compared with patients who received 5FU alone (72%), in the SEER-Medicare data. The effect of oxaliplatin on
AEs was greater in older patients: The odds ratio was 2.10 (95% confidence interval, 1.53-2.87) for patients aged 75 years versus 1.75
(95% confidence interval, 1.39-2.21) for patients aged <75 years. ER use was high in Medicaid patients (83% of those who received
chemotherapy), but neither ER use nor hospitalization was increased by oxaliplatin. The 60-day mortality rate was 1% to 3% for
patients who received 5FU alone and 1% to 2% for patients who received combined 5FU/oxaliplatin. CONCLUSIONS: The incremental
harms of adjuvant chemotherapy with 5FU/oxaliplatin versus 5FU alone were modest in patients with stage III colon cancer who were
insured by Medicare and Medicaid. The additional harms in patients aged 75 years largely were restricted to outpatient events and

INTRODUCTION
Colorectal cancer is the third leading cause of cancer-related death in the United States.1 For patients with stage III (lymph
node-positive) colon cancer, 6 months of postsurgical adjuvant chemotherapy with leucovorin-modulated 5-fluorouracil
(5FU) was the standard of care from 1990 to 2004 based on clinical trials that demonstrated a 25% relative reduction in
mortality over surgery alone.2,3 Since 2004, the combination of 5FU and oxaliplatin has been standard based on a 20%
further reduction in mortality offered by the addition of oxaliplatin.4
Although the addition of oxaliplatin to adjuvant therapy improves survival, it also increases toxicity. In the pivotal
Multicenter International Study of Oxaliplatin/5-Fluororacil/Leucovorin in the Adjuvant Treatment of Colon Cancer
(MOSAIC) trial, oxaliplatin increased severe paresthesias by 12%; increased severe neutropenia by 37%; and increased

severe nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea by 3% to 4% each.5
Less severe toxicities were increased more profoundly.
Little is known about the severity of oxaliplatin toxicity in
patients treated in the community who are older and less
healthy than clinical trial populations.6,7 Moreover,
although drug dosing and supportive care are well defined
in trials, off-trial patients may face various dosing and
supportive care practices that could alter the tolerability of
oxaliplatin.
In 2010, Kahn et al reported on the toxicity of adjuvant chemotherapy among patients with stage III colon
cancer in the Cancer Care Outcomes Research and
Surveillance Consortium (CanCORS) study, a cohort of
newly diagnosed patients from diverse treatment settings.8
Among 574 patients with stage III colon cancer who
received chemotherapy in CanCORS, adverse events
between 31 days and 15 months after surgical resection
were higher in patients who received oxaliplatin; however,
after excluding neuropathy, patients who received oxaliplatin did not experience more adverse events in any age
group. However, in light of the known increase in toxicity
from oxaliplatin observed in clinical trials and because
only 14 patients aged 75 years in CanCORS received
oxaliplatin, the true incremental toxicity of oxaliplatin in
the community in general, and in patients aged >75 years
in particular, remains unmeasured.
The primary objective of the current study was to
examine whether oxaliplatin-containing chemotherapy
regimens result in measurable differences in toxicity experienced by patients treated in the context of usual care.
Data from 3 observational cohorts were used to compare
hospitalization, emergency department (ER) use, and billing for common adverse events (AEs) between patients
who received oxaliplatin/5FU and patients who received
5FU in the community.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Data Sources

Cohorts for this study were derived from the National
Cancer Institute (NCI) Surveillance, Epidemiology, and
End Results (SEER) registry linked to Medicare claims
(SEER-Medicare), the New York State Cancer Registry
(NYSCR) linked to Medicaid claims, and NYSCR linked
to Medicare claims. The NCI links data on incident cancers from the SEER Program of cancer registries to
patients’ corresponding fee-for-service Medicare claims,
thus allowing longitudinal assessment of treatment and
outcomes.9,10 SEER-Medicare data for the years 2003 to
2007 were included. The NYSCR-linked Medicare and
Medicaid data (years 2002-2006) fundamentally are simi4310

lar, with NYSCR data linked to administrative claims
data from beneficiaries of these public insurance programs. The Institutional Review Board at the Brigham
and Women’s Hospital/Dana-Farber Cancer Institute
approved this study (IRB 08-338).
Sample Eligibility and Treatment Ascertainment

To assure complete capture of claims data, Medicare
patients were excluded if they were enrolled in a Medicare
Managed Care/health maintenance organization (HMO)
or if they were not continuously enrolled in Medicare
Parts A and B during the 12 months after diagnosis. Medicaid patients were excluded if they were not continuously
enrolled in Medicaid in the 12 months after diagnosis. To
facilitate the interpretation of dual Medicare-eligible and
Medicaid-eligible patients, NYSCR-Medicare was restricted to patients aged 65 years, including dual-eligible
patients; and NYSCR-Medicaid was restricted to patients
aged <65 years, including dual-eligible patients. Eligible
patients had newly diagnosed, stage III adenocarcinoma
of the colon (excluding the rectum) that was resected
within 90 days of diagnosis. Patients were excluded if they
died within 30 days of surgery or if they had received
radiation therapy between the time of diagnosis to 120
days after surgery (Fig. 1).
Patients without a chemotherapy claim within 120
days of surgery comprised a no-chemotherapy group.
Patients who had a chemotherapy claim within 120 days
of surgery were assigned to the 5FU/oxaliplatin group if
they had an oxaliplatin claim within 30 days of starting
chemotherapy. Patients were assigned to the 5FU group if
they had any 5FU or capecitabine claim and no claim for
oxaliplatin, irinotecan, cetuximab, or bevacizumab within
30 days of starting chemotherapy. Patients who received
chemotherapy regimens that did not fall into either of
these 2 categories were excluded.
Because the intent of the study was to compare
adverse chemotherapy outcomes, a control group of
patients with resected stage II colon cancer was included
to provide an estimate of the baseline rate of events
expected from a similar group of patients with surgically
resected colon cancer who did not receive chemotherapy.
Patients with untreated stage II disease were chosen as a
comparison group, because adjuvant chemotherapy in
stage II colon cancer is optional in light of the small absolute benefit provided. In contrast, chemotherapy is standard for stage III colon cancers; therefore, patients with
untreated stage III disease inevitably are different, presumably sicker, than treated patients. The stage II control
group met eligibility criteria defined above but had no

claims for chemotherapy within 120 days from surgical
resection. A small proportion of patients assigned to this
no-chemotherapy stage II group (2.6% in SEER-Medicare, 5.4% in NYSCR-Medicare, 10% in NYSCR-Medicaid) had a claim for chemotherapy between 121 days and
240 days from surgical resection.
Outcome Measures

Outcomes were measured during an 8-month window
from 30 days to 9 months postresection. This start time
was chosen because it could be measured reliably for all
patients. Because median time to the start of chemotherapy in these cohorts was 40 days, this measure approximated the chemotherapy start date. The window
Cancer

encompasses the standard 6 months of adjuvant chemotherapy, allowing for treatment delays and for the capture
of immediate post-therapy outcomes.
Outcomes included outpatient AE claims, all-cause
hospitalizations, all-cause ER visits that did not result in
hospitalization, and 60-day mortality (from 30 days postsurgery). The incidence of specific chemotherapy-associated AEs (diarrhea, dehydration, nausea/vomiting,
neutropenia, infections, deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolus, acute coronary syndromes, and transient ischemic attack/stroke) was examined using
International Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision,
Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) diagnostic codes in
outpatient records (codes available upon request). Finally,
4311

we examined the duration of chemotherapy, defined as
the interval between the first and last dates of chemotherapy record.
The following covariates were available: age, sex,
race, tumor substage, tumor grade, year of diagnosis, and
income based on zip code of census tract. The Deyo and
Klabunde modifications of the Charlson Comorbidity
Index were measured based on claims from 1 to 13
months before the month of diagnosis.11-13
Statistical Analysis

The primary analytic focus of this study was to compare
rates of adverse outcomes among patients who received
5FU/oxaliplatin versus patients who received 5FU only.
Because of stipulations surrounding data use and differences in ascertainment between SEER-Medicare and the
NYSCR cohorts, the results were not combined. Rather,
outcomes were analyzed independently after applying
consistent cohort specifications. Unadjusted and multivariate adjusted logistic regression analyses were used to
compare outcomes between patients who received 5FU/
oxaliplatin and patients who received 5FU. All covariates
were retained in multivariate models to facilitate crosssample comparison. Statistical analyses were conducted
using the SAS software package (version 9.2; SAS
Institute, Cary, NC).
Because our cohorts varied substantially in age
composition (Medicaid patients are aged <65 years, and
Medicare patients are aged 65 years) and because the
underlying evidence base varies by age (the benefit of
adjuvant chemotherapy in patients aged <75 years has
been clearly demonstrated in clinical trials, but the benefit
in patients aged >75 years is unknown), we present all of
our results stratified by age (<75 years vs 75 years).
Although others have used 70 years as a cutoff age for
subgroup analyses,14-16 we chose age 75 years, because
there is the least evidence for this age group in light of
the recent report from Kahn et al and the findings
from the MOSAIC trial, which excluded patients aged
>75 years.5,8
Because factors related to treatment selection, eg,
frailty, may be expected to confound the rate of adverse
outcomes, we performed a propensity score (PS)-matched
analysis in the patients who received chemotherapy to
compare rates of adverse outcomes within patients who
had a similar risk.17,18 We generated a PS for the
likelihood of receiving oxaliplatin from clinically relevant
covariates (all covariates in Table 1) then matched 5FU/
oxaliplatin patients with patients who had the same PS in
the 5FU group. Patients for whom there was no match
4312

were excluded, creating a smaller cohort of patients balanced across treatment groups for measured confounders.
Adverse outcomes were then compared in this similar
risk group.
RESULTS
In total, 21,942 patients with stage II and III colon cancer
met criteria for inclusion, including 16,807 from
the SEER-Medicare database, 4638 from the NYSCRMedicare database, and 497 from the NYSCR-Medicaid
database (Table 1). The demographic distribution of the
cohorts varied. The NYSCR-Medicaid sample was
younger and had larger nonwhite (43%) and Latino
populations than the Medicare samples.
Thirty-eight percent of the 4199 patients with stage
III disease who received chemotherapy in the SEERMedicare sample received 5FU/oxaliplatin, compared
with 18% of 355 patients who received chemotherapy in
the NYSCR-Medicaid sample (aged <65 years) and 20%
of 1570 patients who received chemotherapy in the
NYSCR-Medicare sample (aged 65 years). The factor
associated most consistently with oxaliplatin use was age:
Oxaliplatin use decreased with increasing age. Year of diagnosis also was an important determinant: The use of
oxaliplatin increased over time.19
Adverse Outcomes

Patients who received chemotherapy had a greater number of outpatient AEs recorded in claims from 1 month to
9 months postresection than untreated patients with stage
II disease; patients who received 5FU/oxaliplatin consistently had the most AE claims. In SEER-Medicare, 54%
of untreated patients with stage II disease had an AE claim
compared with 72% of patients who received 5FU-treated
and 81% of patients who received 5FU/oxaliplatin
(Table 2, Fig. 2). Corresponding AE rates in NYSCRMedicare were 59% of untreated patients with stage II
disease, 80% of patients who received 5FU, and 87% of
patients who received 5FU/oxaliplatin. AE rates in
NYSCR-Medicaid were 47% for patients with untreated
stage II disease, 74% for patients who received 5FU, and
82% for patients who received 5FU/oxaliplatin. The
adjusted odds of an AE were increased by oxaliplatin for
all cohorts and were similar in the PS-matched analysis
(Table 3). The most commonly identified AEs among all
patients who received chemotherapy were diarrhea, dehydration, and nausea and/or vomiting (Table 4).
There was modest evidence of increased toxicity
from 5FU/oxaliplatin relative to 5FU with advancing age.

the adjusted odds of an AE between 5FU and oxaliplatin
among patients aged 75 years were greater than the odds
among patients aged <75 years, and a similar trend was

observed in the PS-matched cohorts. Further age stratification in the SEER-Medicare sample revealed a trend toward an increasing effect on AEs with age (ages 65-69
years: odds ratio [OR], 1.67; 95% confidence interval
[CI], 1.24-2.24; ages 70-74 years: OR, 3.18; 95% CI,
0.38-26.3; ages 75-79 years: OR, 1.80; 1.27-2.55; ages
80-84 years: OR, 3.37; 95% CI, 1.74-6.51; aged 85
years: OR, 3.18; 95% CI, 0.38-26.8).
Combined 5FU/oxaliplatin was not associated with
increased ER use. In the SEER-Medicare sample, 41% of
patients who received 5FU and 41% patients who
received 5FU/oxaliplatin required an ER visit, although a
5% increase in ER use among patients who received oxaliplatin was observed in the PS-matched analysis (OR,
1.22; 95% CI, 1.01-1.46). Oxaliplatin did not increase
ER use in either NYSCR cohort. However, ER use in the
NYSCR-Medicaid cohort was exceptionally high, and
74% of patients with untreated stage II disease and 83%
of both chemotherapy groups visited an ER 1 month to 9
months after undergoing resection.
Hospitalization was more common in patients who
received 5FU than in patients who received 5FU/oxaliplatin; in the NYSCR-Medicare sample, there was a significant decrease in the adjusted odds of hospitalization in
those who received oxaliplatin (OR, 0.63; 95% CI,
0.47-0.84) that persisted with PS matching. However, all
chemotherapy-treated patients were hospitalized more
commonly than patients with untreated stage II disease.
This trend was most pronounced in the NYSCR-Medicaid population, in which 17% of patients who had
untreated stage II disease were hospitalized compared
with 40% of patients who had stage III disease and
received oxaliplatin. Hospitalization rates among patients
aged 75 years were high even in the patients with
untreated stage II disease (SEER-Medicare, sample, 31%;
NYSCR-Medicare sample, 46%).
In stratified analyses, there was no consistent evidence of a differential or increased risk of ER use or hospitalization from 5FU/oxalipatin, including the 2

commonly cited factors for omitting oxaliplatin: advanced
age or comorbidity. The mortality rate between 30 days
and 90 days after resection, the surrogate for 60-day treatment mortality, was 3% in all subgroups.
Duration of Chemotherapy

In both age cohorts, fewer patients who received 5FU
than patients who received 5FU/oxaplatin still had claims
for chemotherapy 9 months after initiating treatment,
suggesting that a shorter duration of chemotherapy was
more common in patients who received 5FU than in
patients who received oxaliplatin (Fig. 3). Eight months
after starting chemotherapy, a large proportion of patients
still had claims for chemotherapy even in the PS-matched
cohort (NYSCR-Medicaid sample: 5FU, 31%; 5FU/oxaliplatin, 23%).
DISCUSSION
Adjuvant chemotherapy improves the chance of cure for
patients with resected stage III colon cancer aged <75
years. The standard of care regimen of 5FU with modulat4316

ing leucovorin plus oxaliplatin increases severe neutropenia, nausea and vomiting, and diarrhea. Despite this
toxicity, in the MOSAIC trial, 75% of patients received
all of the planned cycles, and 80% of the planned oxaliplatin dose was delivered in those cycles,5 suggesting that the
toxicity from this regimen is manageable with proper supportive care.
By using population-based registry data linked
to administrative claims to compare rates of adverse
outcomes in chemotherapy-treated patients with stage III
colon cancer, we observed higher rates of AEs in chemotherapy-treated patients compared with a control group of
patients with stage II colon cancer who underwent similar
surgery but did not receive any chemotherapy. We also
observed higher rates of AEs in patients who received
5FU/oxaliplatin compared with patients who received
5FU. Despite more AEs between 1 month to 9 months
after surgical resection, patients who received 5FU/oxaliplatin were not more likely to require ER visits or hospitalization. The toxicity of 5FU/oxaliplatin relative to that
of 5FU, as measured by AE claims, was more pronounced

in patients aged 75 years; however, age did not modify
the effect of oxaliplatin on ER visits or hospitalizations.
Our findings of higher AE rates in patients who
received oxaliplatin and of relatively greater toxicity from
5FU/oxaliplatin in older patients conflict with recent
results from CanCORS. CanCORS is a study of incident
cases of stage III colon cancer from a heterogeneously
sampled group of health systems that approximates a population-based sample. In CanCORS, after excluding
peripheral neuropathy, which we did not include in our
investigation of claims-based outpatient AEs, there was no
difference in the mean number of AEs between patients
who did and did not receive oxaliplatin. Patients aged
75 years who received chemotherapy in CanCORS
4318

were less likely to experience adverse outcomes between 1
month to 15 months after surgical resection than patients
ages 55 to 74 years.8 AEs were ascertained very differently
in these 2 investigations: CanCORS used medical record
abstraction, and we used claims in our study. Although it
seems reasonable to anticipate better AE capture from
medical record review than from claims, only 24% of
patients aged >75 years in CanCORS who received
chemotherapy experienced a chart-abstracted AE compared with 76% of our SEER-Medicare patients aged
75 years with a claim-based AE.
Although oxaliplatin did not increase the need for
hospitalization, rates of hospitalization in our sample of
older (Medicare) and disadvantaged (Medicaid) Americans with colon cancer were exceptionally high. Between
38% and 56% of all patients we examined who received
chemotherapy required hospitalization during the interval
between 31 days to 9 months after resection of their cancer. In contrast, in the CanCORS study, only 13% to
19% of patients required hospitalization from 1 month to
15 months after surgery, which may be related to lower
rates of ascertainment of hospitalization through medical
record review or differences in patient samples. In neither
CanCORS nor our claims-based analyses was there any
evidence of an increased need for hospitalization with age.
ER use was particularly frequent in NYSCR-Medicaid patients. Compared with an estimated 24% of general
Medicaid patients using the ER annually,20 74% of
patients with stage II disease and 83% of patients who
received oxaliplatin the NYSCR-Medicaid sample used
the ER. This exceptionally high rate of ER use probably is
related less to treatment than to health system factors,
such as barriers to seeking care from oncologists related to
communication, race, and poverty. Our results should
prompt the development of strategies to optimally support Medicaid-insured patients during adjuvant chemotherapy with the objective of minimizing ER use, which is
not optimized for symptom management, and thus,
improving health outcomes. Because this effectiveness
research is conducted in collaboration with the leadership
of the New York State Health Department, these results
can be used to inform care design at the local level.
We observed that the duration of chemotherapy in
this community sample differed substantially from the
standard 6-month course. Although a chemotherapy
duration of <4 months was associated previously with
increased mortality in patients with stage III colon cancer
who received 5FU in the SEER-Medicare database,21 that
may be related to factors associated with discontinuation.
Indeed, there is some suggestion that 6 months may not
Cancer

Toxicity of 5FU vs 5FU/Oxaliplatin/Sanoff et al

be required,22 an issue that is being addressed by the currently enrolling clinical Cancer and Leukemia Group B
(CALGB) trial CALGB 80702. With that in mind, we
were surprised to observe that nearly 1 in 5 patients was
still receiving chemotherapy 9 months after the initiation
of treatment. A small proportion of these patients probably continued therapy because they developed metastatic
disease. Others may have required dose delays for toxicity;
however, it is unknown whether continuing chemotherapy for as long as 9 months after surgical resection has any
effect on micrometastatic cancer.
The current results are limited by the nature of
administrative claims data. Claims best capture AEs of
sufficient severity to require an intervention and rely on
the physician’s thoroughness in coding.23 Indeed, for that
reason, we did not investigate the most common AE of
oxaliplatin: neuropathy. Certainly, if we had been able to
accurately capture neuropathy, then the AE rate in
patients who received 5FU/oxaliplatin would have been
higher. Also, patients with more comorbidity may be less
likely to have treatment-related AEs coded when competing illnesses better meet requirements for billing a ‘‘complex’’ Evaluation and Management code. Such differential
reporting may be expected to decrease AE capture in older
and sicker patients. Rates of hospitalization and ER use,
however, are less dependent on coding practice. Between
2% and 10% of our control group of patients with
untreated stage II disease received some chemotherapy
during the observation window, which slightly diminishes
our ability to conclude causality with regard to higher the
AE rate in patients with stage III disease. In addition, we
attempted to address selection bias through PS matching;
however, such methods cannot account for unmeasured
confounding. If patients who received 5FU were inherently sicker than the oxaliplatin cohort, then they may
have greater rates of adverse outcomes regardless of chemotherapy treatment.
Acknowledging these limitations, we observed small
increases in AEs among patients with stage III colon cancer who received 5FU/oxaliplatin compared with patients
who received 5FU alone. Among patients aged 75 years,
we observed a modest differential increase in AEs from
oxaliplatin but without increased need for ER visits or
hospitalizations. These data provide additional evidence
that, although oxaliplatin does increase AEs, for most
patients, this does not extend to include severe and lifethreatening toxicities that require hospitalization. By
using a similar multicohort strategy, we have also observed
that adjuvant therapy retains its effectiveness in the community.19 Our results support oxaliplatin-based chemoCancer
