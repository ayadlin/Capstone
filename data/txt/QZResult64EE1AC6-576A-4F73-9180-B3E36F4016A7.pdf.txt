Abstract

Author Manuscript

TRAIL and agonistic antibodies against TRAIL death receptors kill tumor cells while causing
virtually no damage to normal cells. Several novel drugs targeting TRAIL receptors are currently
in clinical trials. However, TRAIL resistance is a common obstacle in TRAIL based therapy and
limits the efficiency of these drugs. In this review article we discuss different mechanisms of
TRAIL resistance and how they can be predicted and therapeutically circumvented. In addition,
we provide a brief overview of all TRAIL based clinical trials conducted so far. It is apparent that
although the effects of TRAIL therapy are disappointingly modest overall, a small subset of
patients responds very well to TRAIL. We argue that the true potential of targeting TRAIL death
receptors in cancer can only be reached when we find efficient ways to select for those patients
that are most likely to benefit from the treatment. To achieve this, it is crucial to identify
biomarkers that can help us predict TRAIL sensitivity.

Introduction

Author Manuscript

The holy grail of cancer therapy is to find drugs that will specifically and efficiently kill
cancer cells while having little to no effect on normal cells. The variability between and
within different kinds of cancer and the cancer cells’ inherent ability to adapt are obstacles
in obtaining this goal. Thus, there is a significant need to define those individuals that will
benefit from a specific therapy while experiencing few side effects.
Since the Tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis inducing ligand (TRAIL) (also known as
APO2 ligand, APO2L) signaling pathway was initially discovered (1), (2), the plausibility of
exploiting it in cancer therapy has been under debate. Initial promising studies demonstrated
a remarkable specificity for inducing apoptosis in tumor cell lines but not in normal cells.
While clinical trials using TRAIL therapies have shown low toxicity in patients,

disappointingly small therapeutic effects have been observed when TRAIL agonists are used
as a monotherapy. It is becoming increasingly apparent that TRAIL therapy may indeed be
very beneficial, but perhaps only for a small subset of patients. Therefore, it is crucial to
identify biomarkers that can predict patient response and to maximize the therapeutic
efficacy through drug combinations that not only synergize with TRAIL but that can also
overcome resistance as it arises. This review covers some of the mechanisms of TRAIL
resistance that have been reported and presents an overview of all the TRAIL-based clinical
trials performed to date. We argue that lessons learned from preclinical research should be
much more integrated into clinical trial design as a way to select the patients most likely to
respond to therapy. Only then can we truly evaluate the efficacy of this drug and see the
extensive research already done in this field come to fruition in the form of increased cancer
patient survival.

TRAIL signaling

Author Manuscript

TRAIL is a member of the death receptor ligand family, a subclass of the tumor necrosis
factor family. The TRAIL protein is expressed on the membrane of a limited number of
immune cells and is also present in a soluble form. It binds to at least five receptors. Two of
these, Death Receptor (DR) 4 (also known as TRAIL receptor 1, TRAIL-R1) and DR5
(TRAIL-R2), are transmembrane receptors with a cytoplasmic death domain (DD) that
transmits apoptotic signals into the cells. Two decoy receptors (DcR), DcR1 (TRAIL-R3)
and DcR2 (TRAIL-R4), do not have functional DD and do not enable apoptosis activation
(3). TRAIL also binds weakly to a fifth receptor, osteoprotegerin (OPG). Several proapoptotic receptor agonists (PARAs) that can trigger TRAIL signaling have been developed,
including recombinant human TRAIL ligand and agonistic antibodies against DR4 and DR5,
as discussed further below.

Author Manuscript

TRAIL signaling induces apoptosis mainly through the extrinsic, or death receptor mediated
pathway. When TRAIL binds to DR4 or DR5, the receptors homotrimerize, enabling the
receptors’ DD to recruit the adaptor protein Fas Associated Death Domain (FADD) and the
inactive, uncleaved form of caspase 8, pro-caspase 8. The receptors, FADD, and pro-caspase
8 or pro-caspase 10 together form the Death Inducing Signaling Complex, (DISC). At the
DISC pro-caspase 8 is activated, a process found to be dependent on both dimerization and
cleavage (4). Activated caspase 8 then cleaves downstream substrates resulting in,
ultimately, the cleavage and activation of effector caspase 3. In some cell types, called Type
I cells, this activation of the extrinsic pathway is sufficient to induce apoptosis. However, in
other cell types, type II cells, activation of the intrinsic (mitochondrial) apoptosis pathway is
required as well. The intrinsic pathway is typically triggered by DNA damage or other cell
stressors, but it can also be activated through caspase 8 or caspase 10-mediated cleavage of
the pro-apoptotic BCL-2 family protein BID. When cleaved, the activated, truncated form of
BID can translocate to the mitochondrial membrane where it interacts with pro-apoptotic
Bcl-2 family members BAX and BAK, enabling these proteins to induce permeabilization of
the mitochondrial membrane. The pro-apoptotic proteins cytochrome c and SMAC/
DIABLO are then released from the mitochondria. Analogous to the DISC, cytochrome c
forms a protein complex, the apoptosome, with SMAC/DIABLO, APAF-1 and procaspase
9, enabling cleavage of procasapase 9 into active caspase 9. Caspase 9 cleaves downstream

effector caspases such as caspase 3, thus converging with and amplifying death receptormediated caspase activation (Fig. 1).
One important distinction between TRAIL-induced apoptosis and apoptosis induced by
conventional chemotherapy and radiotherapy is that the latter is largely dependent on
cellular damage recognition by, for example, the p53 tumor-suppressor protein. The
dependence on p53 to elicit an apoptotic response poses a problem in cancer therapy since
loss of p53 occurs in more than half of all cancers cells due to inactivating mutations (5).
Although the TRAIL pathway is enhanced by p53 activation through upregulation of DR4, it
can induce apoptosis in cells in which p53 is deleted (6). Therefore, TRAIL therapeutics
may be an alternative way of eradicating tumors that are resistant to a wide range of
conventional therapies.

Author Manuscript

In addition to the classical apoptosis-inducing TRAIL pathway, it is becoming increasingly
evident that TRAIL signaling can also activate other pathways including the NFkB,
PKB/AKT and MAPK pathways, through the formation of signaling complexes secondary
to the DISC consisting of different proteins including receptor-interacting protein (RIP),
FADD, caspase 8, and TNF-receptor associated protein (TRAF-2) (reviewed in (7). Some of
these pathways promote survival and proliferation and importantly, in cells that are resistant
to apoptosis induced by TRAIL, these pathways may still be intact. For example, in TRAILresistant primary leukemia cells, TRAIL induces proliferation in previously resting cells,
accelerates the doubling time of proliferating cells, and reduces spontaneous cell death in a
NF-κB-dependent manner (8). Furthermore, TRAIL promotes metastasis from TRAILresistant human pancreatic ductal carcinoma xenografts (9). Thus, if patients that have
TRAIL resistant tumors are treated with TRAIL, it may actually lead to increased tumor
burden and metastasis. This highlights the critical importance of identifying patients whose
tumors will be responsive to TRAIL-induced death, and to develop means to counteract
TRAIL resistance through combinations with other drugs.

The physiological role of TRAIL

Author Manuscript

The physiological function of TRAIL is reported to be in immune surveillance and immune
mediated tumor suppression. TRAIL is exclusively expressed on immune cells and can be
triggered by antigens such as lipopolysacharides (LPS) and cytokines such as interferons
(IFNs), suggesting that TRAIL plays a regulatory role in the immune system (10–12)
TRAIL deficient (TRAIL −/−) mice are viable, developmentally normal, and fertile (13,14).
However, TRAIL−/− mice have a decreased level of lymphoid and myeloid cell death and
are less sensitive to infection by Listeria monocytogenes (15). In addition, mice that lack the
functional mouse TRAIL receptor mDR5 exhibit an enhanced innate immune response and
are more resistant to murine cytomegalovirus (16), demonstrating a role of TRAIL in the
negative regulation of both innate and adaptive immunity. The first evidence for a role of
TRAIL in tumor suppression came from a study by Walczak and colleagues that
demonstrated a reduction in the size of human mammary adenocarcinoma xenografts in
mice administered soluble recombinant TRAIL(17,6). Accordingly, in both TRAIL −/−
mice and mice treated with a neutralizing anti-TRAIL antibody, inoculation with renal
carcinoma and mammary carcinoma cells results in faster growing and more metastatic

tumors than in wild type mice (13), and aged TRAIL −/− mice have an increased incidence
of lymphoma (18).

TRAIL as a selective killer of cancer cells

Author Manuscript

Interest in TRAIL as an anti-cancer agent was initiated by early studies in which TRAILinduced killing could be demonstrated in a wide variety of tumor cells in vitro (1) (2) and in
vivo (17, 6, 19), whereas normal cells were unaffected by TRAIL treatment. Early on, an
alarming study indicated that TRAIL was toxic to normal human hepatocytes, seemingly
disqualifying TRAIL for clinical applications because of the risk of hepatotoxicity or
fulminant hepatic failure (20). The group attributed the discrepancy to a difference in model
systems, but the toxicity was later shown to be an artifact caused by the particular
preparation of TRAIL. The recombinant proteins used in this study were tagged with
polyhistidine and also had a suboptimal level of zinc, changing the tertiary structure of the
protein and causing it to over-aggregate. The tagged preparation was not only toxic to
normal hepatocytes but was also less efficient at inducing apoptosis in cancer cells (21).
Untagged trimeric proteins with optimal zinc content showed an absence of hepatocyte
toxicity both in primary human hepatocyte culture (22) and in systemic administration to
non-human primates (6, 21)

Author Manuscript

The physiological role of TRAIL signaling in tumor suppression and its specificity for
cancer cells versus normal cells has important implications. Since TRAIL signaling is a
physiological means of preventing cancer, it is plausible that induction of this pathway
would be an efficient way to combat existing tumors in a clinical setting. Furthermore,
TRAIL-induced killing should be specific to cancer cells, sparing normal cells. However,
since TRAIL-induced killing is likely part of the body’s first-line defense against cancer,
successful tumors may need to acquire resistance against TRAIL-induced apoptosis. Indeed,
a large proportion of tumor cells that metastasize are resistant to TRAIL, and TRAIL
resistance may also arise during the course of cancer treatment. Thus we have a potential
“Catch-22” situation, where the attributes that make TRAIL receptor targeted drugs
attractive (their tumor selectivity and the fact that they are boosting a physiological tumor
suppression mechanism) are likely to be selected against during tumor evolution. Therefore
one would expect that the ability to predict and circumvent TRAIL resistance will be
essential for the successful clinical use of these drugs.

TRAIL resistance

Author Manuscript

Multiple mechanisms of TRAIL resistance have been identified. Theoretically, resistance
mechanisms could target any of the events starting from TRAIL ligand binding through to
the endpoint of apoptosis by affecting the expression and/or function of TRAIL pathway
components (Fig.2). Some of the major mechanisms are discussed below.

TRAIL receptors as regulators of TRAIL resistance
Early on, it was postulated that TRAIL resistance was mediated by the non-functional decoy
receptors, DCR1 and DCR2, competing with the functional receptors DR4 and DR5 for
TRAIL binding. The expression of DR4 and DR5 is detectable in most tissues but is lower

in normal cells than in cancer cells (23). However, studies have failed to find a consistent
correlation between the expression of functional receptors, decoy receptors, and TRAIL
sensitivity in cancer cell lines and tumors (24–27). In contrast, downregulation of DR4
and/or DR5 by epigenetic changes such as silencing by hypermethylation (28) or by
deletions or point mutations (29–31) is frequently associated with TRAIL resistance in
cancer, suggesting that a functional receptor is, at least, necessary for activity. Despite the
poor correlation between exact levels and sensitivity to TRAIL, upregulation of DR4 and/or
DR5 appears to mediate enhanced TRAIL sensitivity by several drugs including the
quercetin derivative LY303511(32), HDAC inhibitors such as trichostatin (33) and the
proteasome inhibitor bortezomib (23). Importantly, the response to TRAIL-stimulating
drugs can not generally be predicted from the expression of DR4 and DR5. Even in cells
where both DR4 and DR5 expression are intact, there is often a preference for usage of one
receptor over another. For example, in chronic lymphocytic leukemia and mantle cell
lymphoma, both DR4 and DR5 are expressed and normal, but TRAIL signaling occurs
almost exclusively through DR4 (34), since signaling through DR5 requires crosslinking of
the agonistic antibody (35), which can be impaired in immuncompromised patients due to
lack of endogenous Fc receptors. Intriguingly, a point mutation in DR5 was found to have a
“dominant negative effect” in the sense that the mutated dysfunctional receptor competes
with the functional DR4 receptor for binding of the TRAIL ligand (31). In light of these
findings, it is clear that soluble TRAIL and agonists to the respective receptors may have
different effects in different tumors depending on which of the DR4 and DR5 receptors is
active. If, in a given tumor, the importance of one receptor over another can be assessed, it
may be possible to enhance TRAIL-induced apoptosis by using receptor agonists that are
cross-linked (35) or that have a high selective affinity for one receptor over the other (36). It
is, however, unlikely that DR4 and DR5 expression per se is a good enough predictor of
TRAIL sensitivity to be used clinically for patient pre-evaluation.

In addition to the receptor levels playing a role in TRAIL sensitivity, their distribution on
the membrane can also affect activity. Cholesterol- and sphingolipid enriched microdomains
in the plasma membrane, called lipid rafts, facilitate pre-clustering of receptors on the cell
membrane, which enhances ligand binding and recruitment of receptor associated signaling
molecules. Sensitization to TRAIL via formation of lipid rafts can be accomplished by
treatment with quercetin (37) and cox-2 inhibitors (38). TRAIL resistance may also be
acquired through inefficient transportation of the receptors to the cell membrane. This
process involves glycosylation, since glycosylation inhibitors restore receptor transport and
TRAIL sensitivity (39). Glycosylation also influences the clustering of receptors so that
highly glycosylated receptors are more prone to dimerize and, consequently, form the
signaling complex required for caspase activation. Interestingly, the protein GALNT14,
which promotes receptor glycosylation and clustering, is associated with TRAIL sensitivity,
as discussed in more detail below (40).

FLIP
The degree by which caspase 8/10 is regulated by FLIP is another determinant of TRAIL
sensitivity. FLIP is structurally similar to caspases and exists in two shorter forms, FLIP
short (FLIPS) and FLIP Raji (FLIPR) and a long form, FLIP long (FLIPL). These forms of

FLIP interfere with TRAIL signaling in distinct ways. FLIPL has a caspase-like domain that
allows it to dimerize with pro-caspase 8 and 10 at the DISC. It can have either a proapoptotic function or an anti-apoptotic function depending on the amount of FLIPL, the
degree of receptor stimulation, and the abundance of the shorter FLIP isoforms (41). In
addition, FLIPL plays a role in survival by forming a complex with pro-caspase 8 that
inhibits RIPK3-dependent necrosis (42). Notably, the FLIPL/ caspase 8 heterodimer results
in a lower degree of activation which alters the substrate specificity, favoring proliferation
and differentiation pathways rather than apoptosis pathways (43). FLIPS and FLIPR are
truncated forms that lack the caspase-like domain and act by competing with the caspases at
the DISC to prevent binding and activation (44, 45). A novel cleavage form of FLIPL, p22,
can augment anti-apoptotic signaling pathways by inducing NFKB activation (46).
Overexpression of FLIP has been linked to TRAIL resistance in many cancers and
conversely, downregulation of FLIP enhances TRAIL-induced apoptosis (reviewed in (47).
Several TRAIL-sensitizing drugs, including withaferin A (48), quercetin (49), agonists of
peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARg) (50) and a novel EGFR-targeted
diphteria toxin (51) all act at least in part by downregulating FLIP. Expression of MYC is
directly correlated to TRAIL sensitivity and involves transcriptional repression of FLIP (52).
In a recent study, an antisense phosphorothioate oligonucleotide (AS PTO) targeting FLIP
sensitized several cancer cell lines but not a normal lung cell line to TRAIL-induced
apoptosis. This FLIP-targeted AS PTO also efficiently enhanced apoptosis in xenograft
models (53). These studies suggest that direct targeting of FLIP may be beneficial as therapy
in combination with TRAIL to circumvent and prevent TRAIL resistance. However, because
of the complexity of the functions of FLIP, where subtle changes in concentration of the
FLIP proteins themselves as well as other DISC components may lead to opposing effects
on apoptosis sensitivity, the usefulness of c-FLIP overexpression as a biomarker for TRAIL
resistance may be limited.

BCL2 family proteins

Author Manuscript

The BCL2 family consists of proteins that either promote or inhibit mitochondria dependent
apoptosis by influencing the permeability of the mitochondrial membrane and/or by
regulating the activity of each other. In TRAIL signaling, pro-apoptotic BID activates BAX
and BAK, inducing permeabilization of the mitochondrial membrane and release of
cytochrome c. Loss of pro-apoptotic BAX (54) and/or BAK (55) as well as overexpression
of anti-apoptotic BCL2 (56,57), BCLXL (58) and MCL1 (59–61) all confer resistance to
TRAIL. Pro-survival BCL2 family proteins can be targeted clinically using BH3 mimetics
(reviewed in (62)) or small molecule inhibitors such as the BCL2 inhibitor HA14-1 (57).
The BH3 mimetic ABT-737 enhances TRAIL killing in multiple cancer cell types,
regardless of MCL1 status, but this effect requires expression of BAX (63). ABT-737
induces upregulation of DR5, suggesting that induction of apoptosis by TRAIL is
augmented through both the intrinsic and extrinsic pathways by this drug (63). Another BH3
mimetic, the BCLXL inhibitor BH3I-2’, synergizes with TRAIL in prostate carcinoma cells
by increasing the amount of BAX/BAK available to be activated by BID (64). Despite the
encouraging pre-clinical data, the complexity and redundancy of the BCL2 family proteins

makes pre-evaluation of patients based on the expression of these proteins cumbersome, and
thus may not be practically feasible.

The inhibitor of apoptosis proteins (IAPs)

Author Manuscript

The extrinsic and the intrinsic pathway converge at the level of activation of effector
caspases such as caspase 3, 7 and 9. The IAPs are a family of proteins that can inhibit
apoptosis by directly inhibiting effector caspases, thus influencing apoptosis signaling from
both pathways of apoptosis induction. The IAPs are antagonized by the protein Smac/
Diablo. The most studied IAP, XIAP, mediates TRAIL resistance when overexpressed (65),
providing a rationale for the inhibition of XIAP as a strategy to enhance TRAIL-induced
apoptosis. Indeed, TRAIL resistance in prostate cancer cells can be overcome by addition of
a zinc chelator which downregulates XIAP (66) and a small-molecule XIAP antagonist
synergizes with TRAIL in vitro and in vivo (67). In a study by Xu and colleagues,
sensitization to TRAIL by cisplatin involved downregulation of the IAP survivin (68).
Similarly, overexpression of SMAC/DIABLO sensitizes prostate cancer cells to TRAIL
coinciding with a reduction in XIAP, cIAP1 and cIAP2 (69). In a recent, more clinically
relevant approach, the non-peptide SMAC mimetic SM-164 was highly synergistic with
TRAIL in breast, prostate and colon cancer cells in vitro, and in breast cancer xenografts in
vivo (70). Interestingly, SM-164 did not only act by inhibiting IAPs, but also by enhancing
DISC formation and recruitment of caspase 8 in a RIP1-dependent manner.

O-Glycosylation and TRAIL sensitivity

Author Manuscript

In an attempt to identify determinants of TRAIL sensitivity, Wagner and co-workers
investigated TRAIL sensitivity in 119 human cancer cell lines and performed whole genome
microarray profiling to detect differences in gene expression between TRAIL-sensitive and
TRAIL-resistant cell lines. The most prominent molecule found to correlate with TRAIL
response in this study was the O-glycosylation initiating enzyme Nacetylgalctosaminyltransferase-14 (GALNT14). Indeed, presence of the enzyme predicted
sensitivity to TRAIL 61% of the time, whereas absence of the enzyme predicted resistance
in 88% of all cases. The authors found that GALNT14 enhanced recruitment and activation
of caspase 8 by promoting ligand-induced clustering of the DR4 and DR5 receptors, but not
of Fas or TNFR1, demonstrating a specific role in sensitization to TRAIL (40). The same
group subsequently developed an immunohistochemical assay that measured the levels of
GALNT14 and of fucosyltransferase (FUT) 3/6, other enzymes involved in O-glycosylation,
in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded human tumor tissues and in human cell lines. These
assays are currently being evaluated in phase II clinical trials as diagnostic tools to predict
sensitivity to the TRAIL receptor agonists dulanermin (recombinant TRAIL) and
drozitumab (agonistic anti-DR5 antibody) (71) as discussed below.

Author Manuscript

Six1
Recently, the homeoprotein Six1 was identified as a novel mediator of TRAIL resistance
(72). Six1 is aberrantly expressed in many forms of cancer and contributes to the malignant
phenotype by promoting tumor initiation, progression and metastasis (73, 74) (75, 76).
Overexpression of Six1 specifically induces TRAIL resistance in TRAIL sensitive ovarian

cancer cells, and knockdown of Six1 sensitizes previously resistant ovarian cancer cells to
TRAIL (72). In concordance with this finding, expression of microRNA-185 overcomes
TRAIL resistance in ovarian cancer cells specifically through down-regulation of Six1 (77).
Importantly, high Six1 expression occurs in more than 60% of women with metastatic
ovarian cancer, and is strongly associated with worse survival in these patients (72). These
data suggest that many ovarian cancers may be TRAIL resistant, and thus refractory to
multiple different therapeutic regimens. Indeed, as Six1 correlates with adverse outcomes,
including metastasis, in many different tumor types, it is tempting to speculate that this
correlation is at least in part due to an acquired resistance to TRAIL, and that high Six1
expression in tumors may be a negative predictor of TRAIL sensitivity. Because Six1
overexpression occurs in a large percentage of ovarian and breast cancers, there is
significant potential for screening of this biomarker to aid in patient selection and, ideally, in
applying more educated treatment regimes. Thus, we are currently evaluating the feasibility
of using Six1 as a biomarker for TRAIL resistance, and are attempting to find ways to define
and circumvent this resistance.

Human Clinical Trials to Date

Author Manuscript

Several proapoptotic receptor agonists (PARAs), including the recombinant human TRAIL
ligand (dulanermin), which targets both DR4 and DR5, and agonistic antibodies against the
functional receptors DR4 (mapatumumab) and DR5 (lexatumumab, drozitumab,
conatumumab, tigatuzumab and LBY-135) have been assessed within clinical trials for
cancer treatment. At the time of this review there were a total of 27 human clinical trials
published on pro-apoptotic receptor agonist therapies (see table 1 and references therein).
Several of these clinical investigational studies have been published and summarized in
prior reviews (78, 79). Table 1 provides an updated summary of all published human clinical
trials to date of both monotherapy and combination therapy utilized in clinical trials. Some
trials have been tumor type focused, while others, particularly the first-in-man studies; have
explored the PARAs in general advanced cancer populations. No trials to date have involved
any degree of molecular preselection.

Single Agent Trials

Author Manuscript

There have been several trials (80–90) evaluating efficacy of Conatumumab AMG 655
(monoclonal antibody DR5 agonist), CS-1008 (humanized monoclonal antibody DR5
agonist), Dulanermin (rhApo2L/TRAIL Proapoptotic receptor agonist), Lexatumumab
(monoclonal antibody DR5 agonist), PRO95780 (fully human monoclonal antibody DR5
agonist) and Mapatumumab (monoclonal antibody DR4 agonist). These agents clearly have
monotherapy activity with isolated responses reported in follicular lymphoma (81)
adenocarcinoma of the lung (85, 91) synovial sarcoma (80). While these responses appear
rare, in some cases they could be very long lasting with one patient still on study at the time
of publication receiving 106 doses over 4 years (91). The most commonly reported toxicity
that could be attributed as a class effect, as it occurred across several different agents, was
rare transaminitis that was reversible on cessation of dosing (82).

Combined Trials
Several trials have been carried out utilizing combined therapy to evaluate the efficacy of
Conatumumab, Dulanermin, Lexatumumab, PRO95780 and Mapatumumab in combination
with other anti cancer therapy (80, 82 92–103). Four separate trials assessed the effect of
adding a PARA to standard 1st line carboplatin and paclitaxel (alone or with bevacizumab)
for advanced NSCLC (101, 104–106). Toxicity was minimally affected by the addition of
their PARAs. However, none of these trials achieved their primary endpoints of improving
response rate or progression free survival.

Author Manuscript

These results are not surprising given the rarity of monotherapy activity. Perhaps this
indicates the rarity of a sensitive subpopulation. Moreover, we should not view the agents
themselves as inactive but only inactive in unselected patients. Within several of the
randomized phase II studies in NSCLC a prolonged tail in the PFS curves, amounting to
approximately 15% of the treated population is apparent. While this is not enough to sway
the median results (104, 105), it is enough that with patient selection, these drugs could
replicate the rare but sustained responses seen in isolated patients in the monotherapy
studies.

Author Manuscript

A large proportion of the drugs used in the combination trials prevent cell division and DNA
replication, for instance by preventing DNA from unwinding (topoisomerase inhibitors such
as irinotecan), by disruption of microtubule function (taxanes such as paclitaxel), or by
inducing apoptosis or cell cycle arrest through several pathways (HDAC inhibitors such as
vorinostat). Other drugs used in combination therapy are specific antibodies targeting
growth factor signaling pathways relevant to different tumor types (for instance,
bevacizumab, which targets VEGFA and cetuximab, which targets EGFR). Importantly,
although many preclinical drugs synergize with TRAIL in cells that are already sensitive to
TRAIL, a much smaller proportion of drugs can be expected to actually reverse resistance to
TRAIL that is already present or that evolves during treatment. If we hypothesize that most
cancers are actually TRAIL resistant, the results from these unselected clinical trials become
almost predictable. In a recent study performed by our group, synergism with TRAIL was
obtained with all 10 drugs tested, whereas only one, the proteasome inhibitor MG132, was
able to overcome resistance in cell lines that had been made resistant to TRAIL through long
term in vitro selection in increasing concentrations of Lexatumumab, through
overexpression of Six1 or through decoy receptor overexpression (107).

Author Manuscript

The conclusion that we should draw from these data is not that TRAIL holds little promise
as a cancer drug, but rather that since resistance to TRAIL is such a common occurrence,
sub-optimal patient selection is likely to have had a negative effect on the accurate
evaluation of these drugs.

Discussion
It is apparent that despite the extensive research on TRAIL resistance mechanisms, we have
somehow failed to incorporate this preclinical data into the selection of patients and tailored
treatment regimens in clinical trials. Because of this failure, we are still lacking an accurate

picture of how efficient TRAIL treatment can be in the right setting. It is crucial that drug
regimens that show no response, when used in studies with suboptimal selection of patients,
are not disqualified, in the event that the treatment would be highly beneficial in another
patient group. It is highly noteworthy that there is to date not a single clinical trial of TRAIL
published that has attempted to preselect patients using specific biomarkers that may predict
response to a specific treatment regimen (108). Because of this, the results of TRAIL
clinical trials performed to date may greatly underestimate the potential of drugs that
activate this pathway. Complicating the design of any such preselection study in the future is
the fact that multiple different resistance mechanisms may occur, potentially influencing the
optimal biomarkers to use depending on the specific receptor agonist and partner drug
involed. For example, in a recent preclinical study evaluating the mechanisms of cisplatin
and TRAIL in combination, cisplatin was shown to enhance TRAIL-induced apoptosis
through survivin downregulation (68). Thus, the ideal future scenario might be that in a
clinical trial involving cisplatin treatment, we should carefully select patients in which the
prevailing TRAIL resistance mechanism exhibited in tumors is an overexpression of
survivin. As we learn more about what governs the susceptibility to DR4 stimulation vs DR5
stimulation, it may even be possible to preselect an optimal TRAIL-targeting agent for some
TRAIL sensitive patients.

Author Manuscript

Although the theoretical side of a biological approach to patient selection is very attractive,
the practical issue of selecting and assaying appropriate biomarkers is a challenge.
Optimally, we would like to be able to select patients that are already sensitive to TRAIL
and/or to define TRAIL resistance markers that are already present or that may arise as a
result of treatment. One exciting approach to this is a GALNT14/FUT3/6 assay which is
currently being evaluated in phase II clinical trials as a diagnostic tool to predict sensitivity
to the TRAIL receptor agonists, dulanermin and drozitumab (71).
However, if there is one thing we have learned from clinical trials it is that in patients,
TRAIL sensitivity is the exception to the rule. In addition, if sensitivity can be predicted
61% of the time from expression of GALNT14 (71), it is likely that an additional biomarker
would be necessary to increase the success rate. Given the large number of patients that
express Six1, this gene may be a critical means by which a large percentage of tumors
acquire TRAIL resistance, and may thus be a potent biomarker as a negative predictor of
responsiveness to TRAIL therapy.

Author Manuscript

It must be emphasized that most resistance mechanisms have been discovered in cell lines
and that the practicality of screening patients for the same resistance mechanisms and, even
more so, inhibiting these mechanisms is not always a plausible route to take. Indeed, in a
recent study by Menke et al, selective inhibition of TRAIL receptors reduced
chemosensitivity in vivo but not in vitro (109). In addition, because of the complexity and
the redundancy of the apoptosis machinery, too focused an approach may be as ineffective
as no approach. One additional approach is to evaluate apoptosis susceptibility further
downstream in the machinery, taking into account not only known players of the intrinsic as
well as the extrinsic pathway, but also as yet unidentified resistance mechanisms. The
principle behind this is that if a tumor cell is more primed for death, regardless of the
mechanisms involved, it is more likely to undergo apoptosis in response to TRAIL. In a

study by Zhang et al, the basal apoptotic rate (BAR) of tumors was measured by the
cleavage of the apoptosis substrate keratin 18 before and after treatment with TRAIL. The
results were encouraging, showing that an initial high BAR was more likely to lead to a total
BAR increase after treatment (110).

Perhaps some combination of approaches will be required. For example, an initial estimation
of the likelihood of a positive response to TRAIL therapy could involve a screening for
positive markers of sensitivity such as high GALNT14 expression, the presence of at least
one of the functional TRAIL receptors, and low or absent Six1 expression. This could be
combined with a more general assessment of the tumor cells’ propensity to undergo
apoptosis by using the BAR assay. When deciding on a combination treatment, we would
ideally like to see a connection between known modes of action of drugs and patient
expression profiles, i.e. if a drug enhances expression of a specific pro-apoptotic protein it
may be more fruitful to use it in patients where the expression of that particular proapoptotic protein is initially low
In conclusion, we have greatly expanded our knowledge about TRAIL signaling and the
factors that regulate it. At the same time, novel drugs that have the potential to specifically
target these regulators have been developed. With these advancements in the field and with
an understanding of the importance of individualized patient selection, we have an
obligation to take the evaluation of TRAIL based treatments to the next level, where this
cancer drug can finally receive a fair trial.

The TRAIL signaling pathway. The TRAIL ligand binds to functional receptors DR4 and
DR5 and non-signaling receptors OPG (not shown), DcR1 and DcR2. Binding of TRAIL
ligand or receptor-specific agonistic antibodies to DR4 and DR5 induces trimerization of the
receptors. The cytoplasmic part of the DR4 and DR5 receptors contain death domains (DD)
that enable recruitment of Fas associated protein with death domain (FADD) and procaspase
8 (proCASP8), enabling cleavage and activation of proCASP8 to its active form caspase 8
(CASP8). CASP8 activates downstream effector caspases both directly and, in some cells,

through activation of the mitochondrial apoptosis pathway through BID cleavage. Once
activated, effector caspases cleave downstream substrates and induce DNA fragmentation,
ultimately leading to apoptosis. For additional details, please refer to the text.

TRAIL signaling pathway and some points of therapeutic intervention. The functional
TRAIL receptors DR4 and DR5 can be activated by proapoptotic receptor agonists such as
Mapatumumab (DR4), Lexatumumab (DR5) and Dulanermin (both DR4 and DR5). Some
drugs, such as HDAC inhibitors and proteasome inhibitors, augment apoptosis by
upregulation of receptor expression. Caspase 8 is activated downstream of receptor
activation. This activation is prevented by FLIP, which in turn is inhibited by AS-PTO and
quercetin. The mitochondrial activation through Bid cleavage is counteracted by prosurvival BCL2 protein family members such as BCL2 and MCL1, which can be
downregulated by HA 14-1 and ABT-737. Further downstream, caspase 9 activation is
prevented by survivin, which can be pharmacologically inhibited by cisplatin and SM-164.
