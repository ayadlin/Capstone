Abstract
Beclin 1 is an essential mediator of autophagy and a regulator
of cell growth and cell death. We examined the effect of Beclin
1 overexpression on the action of estradiol (E2) and two
antiestrogens, raloxifene and 4-hydroxytamoxifen, in estrogen
receptor A (ERA)-positive MCF-7 breast cancer cells. [3H]thymidine incorporation studies showed that Beclin 1–overexpressing cells (MCF-7.beclin) had a lower proliferative
response to E2 compared with cells transfected with vector
control (MCF-7.control). There was only a 35% increase in
[3H]-thymidine incorporation, after 24 hours of E2 treatment
of MCF-7.beclin cells compared with untreated cells, whereas
this increase was 2-fold for MCF-7.control cells. E2-induced
changes in the expression of early-response genes were
examined by real-time quantitiative PCR. There were
significant differences in the pattern of expression of
E2-induced genes c-myc, c-fos, Erg-1, and Nur77 between
MCF-7.beclin and MCF-7.control cells two hours after treatment. Although E2-induced growth of MCF-7.control cells was
completely inhibited by 500 nmol/L raloxifene or 500 nmol/L
4-hydroxytamoxifen, these concentrations of antiestrogens
had no significant effect on the growth of MCF-7.beclin cells.
Confocal microscopic and coimmunoprecipitation studies
showed evidence for colocalization and association of Beclin
1 and ERA. In addition, E2 caused a decrease in Akt
phosphorylation in MCF-7.beclin cells, compared with a
3-fold increase in MCF-7 cells, five minutes after treatment.
These results indicate that Beclin 1 can down-regulate
estrogenic signaling and growth response, and contribute to
the development of antiestrogen resistance. This observation
might be useful to define and overcome antiestrogen
resistance of breast cancer. [Cancer Res 2008;68(19):7855–63]

Introduction
Beclin 1 is an essential gene in autophagy, a cell survival pathway
that enables use of long-lived proteins as a source of amino acids
under conditions of nutritional deprivation (1–4). In autophagy,
Beclin 1 interacts with class III phosphatidylinositol-3-OH kinase
(vps34) during autophagosomal membrane engulfing of damaged
cytoplasmic organelles and long-lived proteins. Autophagy can
facilitate cell survival, delaying apoptotic death (5, 6). Alternatively,

autophagy can facilitate a form of cell death called autophagic or
type II programmed cell death, characterized by autophagic
vacuoles in the cytoplasm (7). Autophagy and Beclin 1 are
important in the balance of breast cancer cell growth and death
(8, 9). The function of Beclin 1 is, in part, defined by its interaction
with the antiapoptotic gene products, Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL (8, 9).
Beclin 1 is also a tumor suppressor gene because one allele of
Beclin 1 is lost in subsets of breast, prostate, and other tumors (10).
Overexpression of Beclin 1 in MCF-7 breast cancer cells reduced
tumorigenicity in nude mice (11). These results raise questions on
molecular pathways by which Beclin 1 modifies estrogenic function
in breast cancer.
Estrogens function through the receptors, estrogen receptor
(ER)a and ERh, the ligand-activated transcription factors controlling the growth of ER-positive breast tumors and target tissues
(12, 13). ERa mediates the proliferative stimulus of E2 on
ER-positive breast cancer cells, whereas ERh suppresses cell
proliferation (14). Estrogenic ligands alter the conformation of
ERs such that ERs recruit coregulatory proteins to the promoter/
enhancer sites of responsive genes to facilitate transcription
(12, 13, 15). ER-recognition of estrogen response element and
associated changes in chromatin stimulate a cell- and tissuespecific network of genes, enabling E2 to exert multiple functions.
In addition, estrogenic action includes nongenomic mechanism(s),
involving membrane ERs and activation of kinase cascades in
association with G protein–coupled receptors or growth factor
receptors (15–17).
Cell signaling through the ERa is pivotal to the regulation
of breast cancer cell growth so that the ERa antagonist, tamoxifen,
is the first targeted breast cancer therapeutic agent (18).
4-Hydroxytamoxifen is an active metabolite of tamoxifen, with
higher affinity for ERa than tamoxifen (19). Although tamoxifen is
initially effective against ERa-positive tumors, resistance develops
in most women (20). The agonistic activity of tamoxifen on uterine
cells is also a cause for concern (21). Raloxifene is an antiestrogen
with mixed agonist/antagonist activity, in a tissue-specific manner
(22, 23). Raloxifene is an agonist capable of enhancing bone density,
whereas it is an antagonist on breast epithelial cells and the
reproductive system. Understanding the basis of agonist activity of
antiestrogens is an important aspect of overcoming antiestrogen
resistance.
For a subset of ERa-positive tumors, cell growth is totally
dependent on ERa (12, 13). Functions of ERa as a transcription
factor and its ability to bind to accessory proteins and coregulators
are critical to the control of cancer cell growth (12, 13). Because
Beclin 1 inhibited E2-dependent MCF-7 tumor growth in immunodeficient mice (10), an interaction between ERa signaling and
Beclin 1 function seemed possible. We, therefore, examined the
consequences of Beclin 1 overexpression on E2-induced cell growth
and cell signaling. We found that E2-induced cell signaling and

gene expression are modified by Beclin 1 and that an interaction of
ERa and Beclin 1 might be involved in the inhibition of estrogenic
cell signaling.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture. MCF-7 cell line was obtained from the American Type
Culture Collection. We obtained MCF7.beclin cells expressing Beclin 1 from
a tetracycline-repressible promoter (pTRE/flag-beclin 1; ref. 11), and a
control cell line containing empty vector (MCF7.control) from Dr. Beth
Levine (University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, TX).
DMEM, phenol red–free DMEM, fetal bovine serum (FBS), and anti–h-actin
antibody were from Sigma Co. Antibiotics, trypsin, and other additives for
cell culture medium were purchased from Invitrogen. Anti-Beclin 1,
antiphospho-Akt, anti-Akt, anti-pERK, and anti–phospho-ERK antibodies
were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology. Anti-ERa antibody was
from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Secondary antibodies conjugated with
Alexa Fluor 633 or Alexa Fluor 488 were from Invitrogen.
MCF-7 cells were maintained in DMEM, supplemented with 100 units/
mL penicillin, 100 Ag/mL streptomycin, 40 Ag/mL gentamicin, 2 Ag/mL
insulin, 0.5 mmol/L sodium pyruvate, 50 mmol/L nonessential amino
acids, 2 mmol/L L-glutamine, and 10% FBS. MCF-7.control and
MCF7.beclin 1 cells were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10%
FBS, 40 Ag/mL gentamicin, 5 mg/mL G418, 2 Ag/mL insulin, 200 Ag/mL
hygromycin, and 2 Ag/mL tetracycline. Before each experiment, cells were
grown for 3 d in phenol red–free DMEM containing serum treated with
dextran-coated charcoal (DCC) to remove serum-derived estrogenic
compounds (16). MCF-7.beclin cells were grown for 3 d in phenol red–
free DMEM without tetracycline, before plating under phenol red–free
conditions.
[3H]-Thymidine incorporation. Cells (0.5  106) were seeded in 6-well
culture plates in phenol red–free DMEM supplemented with DCC treated
serum and additives. After 24 h of plating, cells were treated with 4 nmol/L
E2. DNA synthesis was measured by adding 4 ACi/mL of [3H]-thymidine,
1 h before harvest (24). Cells were treated with 5% trichloroacetic acid
followed by 1 N NaOH, and 1 N HCl. The radioactive thymidine in cellular
DNA was quantified by liquid scintillation counting.
Cell proliferation. MCF-7.beclin cells were seeded at a density of
5  104 cells per well in 24-well plates, in the presence of tetracycline in
phenol red–free medium. A parallel study was set up with MCF-7.beclin
cells without tetracycline. Cells were dosed 24 h after plating, with 4 nmol/L
E2, and redosed after 48 h. After appropriate treatment periods, live cells
were counted using the trypan blue exclusion, using a hemocytometer.
CellTiter Glo assay. This assay measures cell viability by level of
ATP content (25). Cells (5  103 per well) were plated in 96-well plates.
E2/antiestrogens were added 24 h after plating. Cells were redosed with
medium change at 48 h after the first dose. After 96 h, cells were treated
with 0.1 mL of CellTiter Glo (Promega) reagent, incubated for 5 min at 22jC,
and luminescence recorded using a GloMax Luminometer (Promega).
qPCR. MCF-7.beclin-1 or MCF-7.control cells (1  106) were seeded in
60-mm culture dishes. After 24 h, cells were treated with E2 (4 nmol/L) for 0,
1, or 2 h. RNA was isolated using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen), and 2 Ag RNA
was reverse transcribed using the first strand cDNA synthesis kit
(Fermentas, Inc.) with random hexamers as primers. The expression of
Tff1 (pS2), c-Myc, c-fos, Erg-1, Nur77, and Gapdh genes was determined by
real-time PCR using the SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Bio-Rad) with
the following primers: 5¶-CAATGGCCACCATGGAGAAC-3¶ and 5¶AACGGTGTCGTCGAAACAGC-3¶ for Tff1 (188 bp); 5¶-CTCCTCACAGCCCACTGGTC-3¶ and 5¶-CTTGGCAGCAGGATAGTCCTTC-3¶ for c-Myc (101
bp); 5¶-CGGGCTTCAACGCAGACTA-3¶ and 5¶-GGTCCGTGCAGAAGTCCTG3¶ for c-Fos (147 bp); 5¶-ACCTGACCGCAGAGTCTTTTC-3¶ and 5¶-GCCAGTATAGGTGATGGGGG-3¶ for Erg-1 (110 bp); 5¶-CGCACAGTGCAGAAAAACG-3¶ and 5¶-TGTCTGTTCGGACAACTTCCTT-3¶ for Nur77
(145 bp); and 5¶-CATGAGAAGTATGACAACAGCCT-3¶ and 5¶-AGTCCTTCCACGATACCAAAGT-3¶ for Gapdh (113 bp). A final volume of 25 AL was
used for qPCR in an IQ5 thermocycler (Bio-Rad). Amplification conditions
were 95jC for 3 min, followed by 40 cycles of 95jC for 15 s and annealing

Cancer Res 2008; 68: (19). October 1, 2008

for 30 s (57jC for Tff1 and 55jC for other genes). qPCR products were
normalized relative to that of Gapdh to correct for differences in template
input. Results are expressed as fold differences in expression of the
indicated gene relative to that of Gapdh. Standard curves were generated
for every target using six 4-fold serial dilutions.
Confocal microscopy. Cells were plated in Labtek 6-well slide chamber
and dosed after 24 h (16). Cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, blocked
in normal goat serum (5%) in PBS, followed by incubation with anti-ERa
antibody (mouse) and anti-Beclin 1 antibody (rabbit) in 2.5% goat serum in
PBS. After washing, cells were incubated with appropriate secondary
antibodies. Alexa Fluor 633 conjugated anti-mouse IgG was used for ERa
(deep red) and Alexa Fluor 488 conjugated anti-rabbit igG (green) was used
for Beclin 1. Experiments were repeated using Alexa Fluor 488–conjugated
anti-mouse IgG for detecting ERa (green) and Alexa Fluor 633 conjugated
anti-rabbit IgG for detecting Beclin 1 (red). Nuclei were stained with 4¶,6diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI; 1 nmol/L). Images were recorded using a
Zeiss 510 Laser scanning microscope with a 60 objective at identical
intensity settings for all treatment groups. No fluorescence was detected
when cells were treated with fluorescence labeled secondary antibody alone.
Immunoprecipitation. Cells (1.5  106 per 60-mm dish) were plated in
dishes and allowed to attach for 24 h before treatments. After the specified
treatments, cells were harvested and cell pellet lysed in buffer containing
50 mmol/L Tris.HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mmol/L NaCl, 1% Triton, 5 mmol/L EDTA,
25 mmol/L sodium fluoride, 25 mmol/L sodium PPi, 2 mmol/L sodium
vanadate, 5% glycerol, 1 mmol/L phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and
1 protease inhibitor cocktail (Calbiochem; ref. 26). Cell lysate (100 Ag in
100 AL lysis buffer) was precleared with Protein A/G agarose and incubated
with 10 AL of anti-ERa (mouse monoclonal) antibody for 16 h at 4jC.
Reaction mixture was incubated with protein A/G-Sepharose for 1 h at 4jC.
Sepharose beads were washed thrice with cold lysis buffer, extracted using
Laemmli buffer, and loaded on 12% SDS polyacrylamide gel for immunoblot
analysis.
Western blot analysis. Cells (1.5  106 per 60-mm dish) were plated in
dishes and allowed to attach for 24 h before treatments. After the
specified treatments and time periods, cells were harvested and cell pellet
was lysed in buffer (16). Proteins (25 Ag) were separated on a 12% SDSpolyacrylamide gel, transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride Polyscreen
membrane and incubated with 1:200 to 1:1,000 dilution of the primary
antibody. Protein bands were visualized using horseradish peroxidase–
conjugated secondary antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and SuperSignal West Peco Chemiluminescent Substrate (Pierce). Membranes
were stripped in stripping buffer [62.5 mmol/L Tris.HCl (pH 6.8), 2%
SDS, 100 mmol/L ( fresh) h-mercaptoethanol] and washed thrice in
washing buffer [20 mmol/L Tris.HCl (pH 7.6), 150 mmol/L NaCl, and
0.05% Tween 20]. A second primary antibody was then added and the
membrane reprobed as needed. To verify equal protein loading,
membranes were stripped and reblotted with anti–h-actin antibody.
Lightly exposed Kodak XAR Biomax films were scanned using an Epson
B4 Scanner and band intensities quantified using the NIH Image J 1.34S
program. Fold changes in the intensity of the protein signals reported are
the mean of the results from three experiments.
Chromatin immunoprecipitation assay. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay was performed as described previously (27) with minor
modifications. Cells (8  106) in 10-cm dishes were washed once with PBS
and cross-linked with 1.5% formaldehyde at 37jC for 10 min. After washing
with PBS, cells were collected in 1.6 mL of lysis buffer [0.5% SDS, 5.6 mmol/
L EDTA, 33 mmol/L Tris.HCl (pH 8.1), 0.5% Triton X-100, 84 mmol/L NaCl]
and incubated on ice for 30 min. Cell lysate was sonicated using Sonicator
3000 (Misonix). Samples were diluted 5-fold with dilution buffer [0.01%
SDS, 1.2 mmol/L EDTA, 16.7 mmol/L Tris.HCl (pH 8.1), 1.1% Triton X-100,
167 mmol/L NaCl] and then precleared with salmon sperm DNA/Protein A
agarose for 2 h at 4jC. Anti-ERa antibody (HC-20, 5 Ag) or rabbit IgG (Santa
Cruz) was used to immunoprecipitation from 200 Ag of protein. Immunoprecipitated DNA was amplified by PCR using AccuPrime TaqDNA polymerase and visualized with ethidium bromide staining. The following
primers from pS2 promoter used were as follows: 5¶-CTAGACGGAATGGGCTTC
ATG-3¶ ( forward) and 5¶-TCCTCCAACCTG ACCTTAATCC-3¶ (reverse).

MCF-7.control and MCF-7.beclin cells. Cells growing in
the absence of phenol red and tetracycline for 3 d
were seeded in 6-well tissue culture plates at a
density of 5  105 cells per well with 3 mL medium.
After 24 h, cells were treated with 0.1 or 4 nmol/L E2.
[3H]-thymidine was added 24 or 48 h after E2
treatment of MCF-7.control (A) and MCF-7.beclin (B)
cells. Cells were harvested for scintillation counting

versus E2 stimulation in the same cell line, at the
indicated time points.

Statistical analysis. All experiments were repeated at least thrice.
Statistical difference between control and treatment groups was
determined by one-way ANOVA followed by Dunnet’s posttest using
SigmaStat statistical program. A P value of <0.05 was considered to be
statistically significant.

Results
We tested the effect of E2 on MCF-7.beclin cells that expressed
Beclin 1 from a tetracycline-repressible promoter. MCF-7 cells
transfected with control plasmid (MCF-7.control) were also treated
with E2 in the same manner. Cells were plated in 6-well plates, and
E2 was added 24 hours later at 0.1 or 4 nmol/L concentrations. At
the time of dosing, 62% F 3% of the cells were in the G1 phase, as
determined by flow cytometry with propidium iodide staining.
[3H]-thymidine incorporation assay was conducted 24 and 48 hours
after E2 treatment. Figure 1A and B shows a comparison of
E2-induced DNA synthesis in MCF-7.beclin and MCF-7.control
cells. MCF-7.control cells showed maximal DNA synthesis in the
presence of 4 nmol/L E2 after 48 hours of treatment. The level of
DNA synthesis in E2-treated cells was f2.5-fold higher than
that of untreated cells at the same time point. In contrast, Beclin
1–transfected cells showed only 75% increase in DNA synthesis
at the 48-hour time point in the presence of 4 nmol/L E2. At the
24-hour time point, MCF-7.control cells showed a 2-fold increase in
DNA synthesis due to E2 treatment. However, only 35% increase in
DNA synthesis was observed in MCF-7.beclin cells. To verify the
level of Beclin 1 protein expression in MCF-7.beclin cells, Western

www.aacrjournals.org

immunoblots were conducted using Beclin 1 antibody. Our result
(Fig. 1C) showed that MCF-7.beclin cells had a 5-fold higher level of
Beclin 1 compared with MCF-7.control cells, as expected from its
overexpression due to transfection.
We next examined E2-induced changes in the expression of early
response genes in MCF-7.control and MCF-7.beclin cells. As shown
in Fig. 1D, there were significant changes in the pattern of
expression of E2-induced genes between MCF-7.beclin cells and
MCF-7.conrol cells. As expected from the E2 sensitivity of
MCF-7.control cells, there was 2- to 3.5-fold higher levels of
transcripts of Tff1, c-myc, c-fos, and Nur77 in these cells, after 2
hours of E2 treatment, compared with those of untreated cells. In
contrast, only c-myc mRNA level showed a moderate increase
at 2 hours after E2 treatment in MCF-7.beclin cells, whereas c-fos,
Erg-1, and Nur77 mRNAs decreased, compared with those of
untreated cells. All of the tested mRNAs showed lower levels in
E2-treated MCF-7.beclin cells, compared with E2-treated MCF7.control cells. These results indicate that the reduction of
E2-induced DNA synthesis in MCF-7.beclin cells is associated with
altered expression of early-response genes.
E2 is known to induce Akt phosphorylation as a part of
nongenomic mechanism of action of ERa (16, 28, 29). We, therefore,
examined whether E2 response is modified in MCF-7.beclin cells.
Cells were treated with 4 nmol/L E2 for 5, 10, 20, and 30 minutes.
Cells were harvested and phospho-Akt levels determined by
Western blots. We found a decrease in Akt phosphorylation in
MCF-7.beclin cells treated with E2, compared with untreated cells

Figure 2. Effect of E2 on Akt phosphorylation in MCF-7.beclin cells and
MCF-7 cells. Cells (1.5  106) were plated in 60-mm dishes and treated with
4 nmol/L E2. Cells were harvested after 5, 10, 20, and 30 min after E2
treatment. Cellular extract was analyzed by Western blots using antibodies
specific to phosphorylated (Ser-478) Akt, followed by sequential probing with
antibodies specific to total Akt, phospho-ERK1/2, total ERK1/2, and h-actin.
Similar results were obtained in three separate experiments.

(Fig. 2). In contrast, in MCF-7 cells, treatment with E2 resulted in a
3-fold increase in Akt phosphorylation, 5 minutes after its addition
(Fig. 2). We also determined the levels of total Akt and phosphoERK1/2 in MCF-7.beclin and control MCF-7 cells. Although there
was no change in the level of total Akt, p-ERK1/2 showed an
increase, 10 minutes after E2 treatment, in MCF-7.beclin and
wild-type cells. The level of h-actin was comparable in all lanes.
These results indicate that whereas E2-induced Akt phosphorylation is down-regulated in the presence of Beclin 1 overexpression,
increase in ERK1/2 phosphorylation remained intact.
We next examined the long-term effects of E2, raloxifene and
4-hydroxytamoxifen, on MCF-7.beclin and MCF-7.control cells
using CellTiter Glo assay. Cells were treated with E2 or antiestrogens for 48 or 96 hours. Assay at 96 hours provided maximal
responses to E2 and antiestrogens. Our results (Fig. 3) show that the
presence of E2 increased the luminescence of MCF-7.control cells
by 2-fold, whereas there was only a 33% increase in luminescence
in MCF-7.beclin cells. Raloxifene and 4-hydroxytamoxifen inhibited
E2-induced growth of MCF-7.control cells at 500 nmol/L. In
MCF-7.beclin cells, raloxifene had no significant effect even at
1,000 nmol/L. With 4-hydroxytamoxifen, E2-induced proliferative
response of MCF-7.beclin cells was not affected at 500 nmol/L
4-hydroxytamoxifen, but it was inhibited at 1,000 nmol/L. However,
the basal proliferation of MCF-7.beclin cells or MCF-7.control cells
in the absence of E2 was not affected by these antiestrogens.
As an additional control for the effects of E2 and antiestrogens in
the absence of Beclin 1 overexpression, we studied MCF-7.beclin
cells in the presence of tetracycline. E2 response of cells containing
tetracycline was similar to that of MCF-7 cells and antiestrogens
suppressed the proliferative effect. However, when cells were
treated with 4-hydroxytamoxifen and raloxifene in the absence of
E2, there was a 30% to 40% increase in proliferation, indicating that
MCF-7.control and MCF-7.beclin cells containing tetracycline have
some differences in antiestrogen responses.

Cancer Res 2008; 68: (19). October 1, 2008

We also examined E2-induced response of MCF-7.beclin cells
by trypan blue exclusion, using a hemocytometer (Fig. 3B).
Experiments were conducted in the presence and absence of
tetracycline. After 48 hours, E2 treatment induced only 20% to
30% increase in cell number, regardless of the presence of
tetracycline. By 4 days, E2 treatment of MCF-7.beclin cells showed
a 2.5-fold increase in cell number in the presence of tetracycline.
However, there was only f50% increase in cell number in
MCF-7.beclin cells in the absence of tetracycline. This result
validates our findings on the influence of Beclin 1 on E2 response,
detected by CellTiter Glo assay.
ERa is known to redistribute within the cell after the addition of
E2 (16, 30). Therefore, we examined whether ERa and Beclin 1
interact and redistribute in the presence of E2 by confocal
microscopy (Fig. 4). In untreated cells, Beclin 1 (green) was found
distributed in both cytoplasm and occasionally in the nucleus. In
contrast, ERa (red) was mainly found in the nucleus. Addition of
E2 caused a movement of Beclin 1 to the perinuclear area. Addition
of E2 caused a redistribution of ERa throughout the cytoplasm and
the nuclei in the case of mitotic cells (Fig. 4A) and toward
cytoplasm in the case of clusters of cells (Fig. 4B). Addition of
E2 enhanced colocalization of ERa and Beclin 1, indicated by the
yellow color in the merged photographs. Redistribution of Beclin
1 and its accumulation in the perinuclear area was illustrated by
the increased colocalization of Beclin 1 with Golgin-97 (Fig. 4C) in
E2-treated cells. These results indicate that localization and
function of Beclin 1 and ERa are being modified by E2.
We next examined the effect of raloxifene and 4-hydroxytamoxifen on the localization of Beclin 1 and ERa in MCF-7.beclin cells.
Figure 5 shows a representative confocal microscopic study of
MCF7.beclin cells with and without raloxifene treatment. In these
experiments, green represents ERa and red represents Beclin 1.
Although a different set of secondary antibodies were used,
accumulation of ERa in the nucleus and distribution of Beclin 1
throughout the cell remained similar to previous studies (11, 16).
However, the intensity of Beclin 1 signal was much stronger for
Alexa Fluor 633–conjugated (red) antibody (Fig. 5), compared with
Alexa Fluor 488–conjugated (green) antibody (Fig. 4). Addition of
raloxifene caused a reorganization of ERa or Beclin 1 so that these
proteins were found throughout cytoplasm and nucleus, including
membrane projections (Fig. 5). Merge pictures showed association
of ERa and Beclin 1 with a strong yellow color, indicating
colocalization of ERa and Beclin 1 (Fig. 5) in the presence of
raloxifene. Colocalization of Beclin 1 and ERa was also observed in
the presence of 4-hydroxytamoxifen (data not shown).
Subsequently, we examined the interaction of ERa and Beclin 1
by coimmunoprecipitation. Our results (Fig. 6A) showed that
Beclin 1 was immunoprecipitated in association with ERa.
Interestingly, addition of E2 caused a 1.5- to 2-fold increase in the
level of Beclin 1 associated with ERa, whereas the presence of
raloxifene caused a 6-fold increase. The presence of 4-hydroxytamoxifen increased the level of Beclin 1 associated with ERa by
2.5-fold. Taken together, results of immunoprecipitation and
subsequent immunoblotting confirmed the association of Beclin
1 with ERa, as observed in confocal microscopic studies. Although

Beclin 1 and Estrogen/Antiestrogen Response

Beclin 1, we conducted direct Western blot analysis. Representative
blots from 24-hour treatment are shown in Fig. 6B. Beclin 1 level
did not undergo any major change due to treatment with E2 or
antiestrogens. ERa level decreased (10–25%) in the presence of
E2 and slightly increased in the presence of antiestrogens (1.5- to
2-fold) after normalizing to h-actin level. These changes in ERa are
consistent with reports on the effects of E2 and antiestrogens on
ERa stability (16, 28).
We next conducted ChIP assay to elucidate the mechanistic
differences in the action of E2 and antiestrogens in MCF-7
and MCF-7.beclin cells. A comparison of the effects of E2,
4-hydroxytamoxifen, and raloxifene on MCF-7 cells and MCF7.beclin cells is presented in Fig. 6C. ChIP assay showed
comparable E2 responses on ERa occupation of pS2 promoter in
both MCF-7 and MCF-7.beclin cells. Thus, the partial inhibition of
the growth of MCF-7.beclin cells is not associated with ERa
binding to pS2 promoter. In the presence of 4-hydroxytamoxifen

and raloxifene, ERa occupation on pS2 promoter was lower in
MCF-7.beclin cells than that in MCF-7 cells. This result argues
against a role for Beclin 1 as a repressor that binds to both ERa and
DNA. Thus, the lack of antiestrogen response in the presence of
Beclin 1 might involve the interaction between ERa and Beclin 1,
physically sequestering ERa away from promoter sites.

Discussion
In this study, we examined the effect of Beclin 1 on E2 function
and found that Beclin 1–overexpressing cells had reduced
proliferative response to E2. qPCR analysis of gene expression
showed that several E2-responsive genes were down-regulated in
cells expressing Beclin 1. E2 caused a decrease in Akt phosphorylation in Beclin 1–transfected cells. Growth inhibitory responses
of antiestrogens, raloxifene, and 4-hydroxytamoxifen were also
limited by Beclin 1 transfection. In contrast, E2-induced growth
of MCF-7.control cells was totally inhibited by antiestrogens.

added 24 h after plating cells, at the indicated concentrations. Medium was withdrawn and cells were redosed 48 h after the first dose. After 96 h of treatment, cells
were harvested by treatment with 0.1 mL of CellTiter Glo reagent. Luminescence was measured using Promega Glomax Luminometer. Relative light units (RLU)
were corrected for background, using readings of an equivalent amount of cell culture medium without cells. Values of RLU for control groups of MCF-7.beclin and
MCF-7.control cells were in the range of 8 to 12  106 RLU. Columns, mean from three experiments; bars, SE. *, P < 0.05, statistical significance compared with

or in a group of cells (B). To confirm the
perinuclear localization of Beclin 1, Golgin
97 localization was examined with Beclin 1
in the presence or absence of E2 (C ).
Similar results were obtained in three
separate experiments.

The presence of E2 caused a reorganization and accumulation of
Beclin 1 in the perinucelar areas of cells. Importantly, we found a
colocalization of ERa and Beclin 1 by confocal microscopy in
MCF-7.beclin cells. An interaction between Beclin 1 and ERa was
also evident from the results of coimmunoprecipitation, followed
by Western immunoblotting. ChIP assay results suggest that
interaction of ERa and Beclin 1 in the presence of antiestrogens
leads to decreased promoter occupancy. Our results show that
Beclin 1 can down-regulate estrogen-induced signaling events and
cell growth in ERa-positive breast cancer cells. Our results further
suggest that Beclin 1 may alter sensitivity of antiestrogens to
breast cancer cells.
There have been extensive efforts to understand tamoxifen
resistance in breast cancer cells (31). Although a primary

Cancer Res 2008; 68: (19). October 1, 2008

mechanism of estrogen insensitivity involves the loss of ERa,
tamoxifen resistance often occurs in the presence of ERa. Because
ERh has a down-regulatory effect on many estrogenic responses, it
is the growth stimulatory responses of ERa that are generally
targeted by tamoxifen (20, 32). A basic mechanism for acquired
tamoxifen resistance is that ERa becomes insensitive, as the
essential growth regulatory circuits are taken over by growth factor
receptors, including members of the HER-2 family of receptors, or
G protein–coupled receptors (20, 33). Our results show that
overexpression of Beclin 1 provides a context under which ERa
does not transmit cell signaling responses such as Akt phosphorylation. Down-regulation of E2-responsive genes, such as c-fos,
Erg-1, and Nur77, is indicative of an altered molecular environment
for estrogenic function. ChIP assay results showed decreased

receptor occupancy of pS2 promoter due to increased Beclin 1
expression, especially in the presence antiestrogens.
Both tamoxifen and raloxifene are selective estrogen receptor
modulators, dependent on the presence of coactivator/corepressor proteins (34). Interaction of ligands with ERa and ERh
induces subtle conformational changes that amplified by the
binding of tissue-specific proteins (35, 36). Raloxifene was first
approved for the prevention of osteoporosis because it enhanced
bone density (37, 38). After large comparative study of tamoxifen
and raloxifene (STAR trial), raloxifene was found to decrease
the incidence of breast cancer and was less prone to induce
endometrial cancer, compared with tamoxifen (39). Cell culture
studies have shown raloxifene resistance (40). The observation
that both 4-hydroxytamoxifen and raloxifene showed a lack
of sensitivity in MCF-7.beclin cells, indicates that a common

factor in antiestrogen resistance might be the functional
availability of ERa, when the receptor is complexed with
proteins such as Beclin 1. Such an interaction might allow
sequestering of Beclin 1, until conditions of nutritional deprivation or stress arise.
Beclin 1–overexpressig cells were first investigated by Liang and
colleagues (11). Although these cells had decreased clonogenicity
and showed a different morphology from that of wild-type
MCF-7 cells, nutritional deprivation was necessary to produce a
large number of autophagosomes (11). Although Beclin 1 was
localized in the endoplasmic reticulum, mitochondria, perinuclear
membrane as well as the nucleus, Beclin 1 mutants deficient in
nuclear export were unable to facilitate autophagy (8). Interestingly,
ERa also shuttles between nucleus, cytoplasm, and peripheral
membrane and interacts with multiple proteins in these locations

plated in 60-mm culture plate and treated for 24 h with
4 nmol/L E2, 1 Amol/L raloxifene, or 1 Amol/L
4-hydroxytamoxifen. Cellular proteins were
immunoprecipitated using anti-ERa (mouse IgG)
antibody. Immunoprecipitate was collected and

in regulating E2-induced expression of hundreds of proteins (29).
Thus, the interaction of ERa and Beclin 1 may affect the function of
both Beclin 1 and ERa.
Our results on DNA synthesis and CellTiter Glo assays showed
that MCF-7.beclin cells had a reduced growth response in the
presence of E2, compared with vector control cells. However,
E2-response was still present, yielding 30% to 75% increase in
DNA synthesis at 24 and 48 hours, respectively. Phospho-Akt
levels in MCF-7.beclin cells showed a decrease after treatment
with E2. Because E2-induced phosphorylation of Akt is dependent
on active ERa (15), the association of ERa and Beclin 1 may
be involved in decreased Akt phosphorylation. In contrast,
ERK1/2 was activated by E2 in Beclin 1–overexpressing cells.
ER-dependent nongenomic functions are dependent on many
coregulators, including modulator of nongenomic actions of
receptor (41) and growth factor receptors (42, 43). E2 facilitates
an interaction between ERa and epidermal growth factor receptor
member, ERBB4 (43). Cross-talk also exists between ERa and
ERBB2 (HER-2) signaling and insulin-like growth factor pathways,
contributing to tamoxifen resistance (42, 44). Different G protein–
coupled receptors and G proteins (such as Gai and Ghg) may be
also involved in E2 responses (45).
Recent studies suggest that Bcl-2 binding domain of Beclin 1
serves as a point of cross-talk between autophagic and apoptotic
pathways (46). Bcl-2 down-regulation by an antisense oligonucleotide provoked autophagic cell death in HL-60 cells (47).
Interestingly, crystallographic studies identified Beclin 1 as a

Bcl-2 homology domain 3–only (BH3-only) protein (9, 48). This
observation would classify Beclin 1 along with other proapoptotic
BH3-only proteins, such as Bim, Bid, and Bok, suggesting a
proapoptotic function that might be activated under unique tissue/
cellular context (49). Whether the interaction of ERa with Beclin 1
modulates proapoptotic function by sequestering essential growth
stimulatory proteins needs to be investigated.
In summary, our results reveal an interaction between ERa and
Beclin 1 in breast cancer cells. This interaction may modulate the
function of ERa and Beclin 1. In the context of ERa function, we
found that Beclin 1–transfected cells were less sensitive to E2induced growth stimulation and to the growth inhibitory effects of
antiestrogens. Thus, a novel function for Beclin 1 might involve
down-regulation of the action of ERa, contributing to resistance of
breast cancer cells to antiestrogens.
