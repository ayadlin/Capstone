Abstract

Author Manuscript

The Crk SH2/SH3 adaptor and the Abl nonreceptor tyrosine kinase were first identified as
oncoproteins, and both can induce tumorigenesis when overexpressed or mutationally activated.
We previously reported the surprising finding that inhibition or knockdown of Abl family kinases
enhanced transformation of mouse fibroblasts by CrkI. Abl family inhibitors are currently used or
are being tested for treatment of human malignancies, and our finding raised concerns that such
inhibitors might actually promote the growth of tumors overexpressing CrkI. Here, we identify the
Dok1 adaptor as the key effector for the enhancement of CrkI transformation by Abl inhibition.
We show that phosphorylation of tyrosines 295 and 361 of Dok1 by Abl family kinases suppresses
CrkI transforming activity, and that upon phosphorylation these tyrosines bind the SH2 domains
of the Ras inhibitor p120 RasGAP. Knockdown of RasGAP resulted in a similar enhancement of
CrkI transformation, consistent with a critical role for Ras activity. Imaging studies using a FRET
sensor of Ras activation revealed alterations in the localization of activated Ras in CrkItransformed cells. Our results support a model in which Dok1 phosphorylation normally
suppresses localized Ras pathway activity in Crk-transformed cells via recruitment and/or
activation of RasGAP, and that preventing this negative feedback mechanism by inhibiting Abl
family kinases leads to enhanced transformation by Crk.

Introduction

Author Manuscript

Crk was first identified as the oncogene of avian sarcoma virus CT10 (1). Later studies
identified the cellular homologs of the viral oncoprotein (v-Crk): CrkI and CrkII are
alternatively spliced forms of Crk (2), and CRKL is encoded by a different gene but is
highly similar to CrkII in sequence and overall structure (3). Crk was the first example of an
SH2/SH3 adaptor, a family of small proteins that lack catalytic domains but contain multiple
modular protein binding domains. CrkI and v-Crk consist of one SH2 and one SH3 domain,
while CrkII and CRKL both have an additional C-terminal SH3 domain (2, 4). CrkII also
contains a regulatory tyrosine residue (Y221 in human CrkII) (4) that, when phosphorylated
by Abl family kinases, binds intramolecularly to the SH2 domain and thus downregulates
biological activity (5). This negative regulatory site is not present in CrkI and v-Crk. Crk
overexpression has been reported in several types of human cancer (6-8), and also in
established cancer cell lines (9, 10). Expression levels of Crk correlated with the
aggressiveness of tumor cells, consistent with a positive role in cancer. In the laboratory,
CrkI overexpression has been used as a model to study the transforming mechanisms of Crk
(2, 11).

Author Manuscript

Like other adaptors, Crk proteins function in signaling by mediating the formation of
multiprotein complexes through their modular protein binding domains (12), and
transformation by v-Crk and CrkI requires the binding activity of both the SH2 and SH3
domains (11, 13). The Crk SH2 domain binds tyrosine-phosphorylated peptides with pY-xx-P motifs (14), and its major binding partners include the focal adhesion proteins paxillin
(15) and p130Cas (16). The N-terminal SH3 domain of Crk binds proline-rich peptides with
P-x-x-P-x-K motifs (17, 18), and the major binding partners include Abl family tyrosine
kinases (19, 20), and small G protein guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) including
Sos (21), DOCK180 (22), and C3G (18).
In our previous work to identify the Crk SH3 binding partners essential for transformation of
NIH3T3 cells by CrkI, we found that the activity of Abl family kinases antagonized the
transforming activity of Crk (11). Knocking down expression of Abl and its close relative
Arg, or inhibiting Abl family kinases with imatinib (a clinically prescribed Abl kinase
inhibitor), both led to increased tumorigenicity of CrkI-overexpressing cells in vitro
(assayed by anchorage independent growth) and in vivo (assayed by injection of cells into
nude mice).

Author Manuscript

The Abl tyrosine kinase, originally identified in Abelson murine leukemia virus (23), causes
Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia (CML) in humans through a chromosomal translocation
resulting in a fusion protein, Bcr-Abl, with constitutively high kinase activity (24).
Clinically, imatinib and similar compounds work by inhibiting Abl kinase activity and are
effective in treating CML. Imatinib has also been shown to inhibit Platelet Derived Growth
Factor Receptor (PDGFR) (25, 26) and c-Kit (27). Due to the efficacy of imatinib in CML
treatment, it and other Abl inhibitors are now used to target Abl, PDGFR and c-Kit in
various types of cancer (28-30). However, our recent observations raise concerns that Abl
inhibitors have the potential to promote the growth and survival of tumor cells in some

instances, particularly in those with CrkI overexpression. We therefore sought to understand
the mechanism whereby Abl inhibition promotes transformation by Crk.

Author Manuscript

In this study, we show that Dok1 is responsible for the enhancement of CrkI transformation
upon Abl kinase inhibition. Dok1 was first discovered as a substrate for Abl (31, 32), and is
one of seven members to the Dok family (33). Dok family proteins lack catalytic domains,
consisting of a Pleckstrin Homology (PH) domain, a phosphotyrosine binding PTB domain,
and a C-terminal tail with multiple tyrosine residues that can be phosphorylated and thereby
recruit proteins containing modular phosphotyrosine (pTyr) binding domains (33). Dok1 and
Dok2 negatively regulate B-cell receptor (BCR) (34) and T-cell receptor (TCR) (35)
signaling and modulate the proliferation of myeloid cells (36, 37). Dok1, 2 and 3 also have
been shown to possess tumor suppressor activity in several studies (38, 39). Our results
suggest the existence of a general feedback control mechanism whereby Abl, Dok family
proteins, and RasGAP work together to locally downregulate Ras activity.

Results
Dok1 is the major Abl-dependent phosphoprotein in Crk-transformed cells
We first examined more closely how Abl inhibition affected the ability of CrkI-transformed
NIH3T3 cells to grow in suspension, a hallmark of malignant transformation. Consistent
with previous results (11), we found a significant increase (up to 10-fold) in the number of
colonies in the soft agar growth assay when cells were treated with the Abl inhibitor
imatinib (Fig. 1a). The stimulatory effect of imatinib increased proportionately with
concentration up to 10μM then decreased slightly, presumably due to increased toxicity (the
reported IC50 for imatinib falls within the range of 0.4 -1.5μM (40)).

We reasoned that Abl inhibition exerted its effects on Crk transformation by altering
tyrosine phosphorylation. To identify Abl-dependent phosphoproteins, lysates of control and
CrkI-transformed cells (with and without imatinib treatment) were immunoblotted with antiphosphotyrosine (anti-pTyr) antibody. A prominent tyrosine-phosphorylated band of ∼64
kDa was seen in CrkI-overexpressing cells when compared to the controls, the
phosphorylation of which was strongly reduced upon imatinib treatment (Fig. 1b). Based on
known substrates of Abl and the apparent molecular weight, we surmised this
phosphoprotein might be Dok1 (31). To test this, a lysate of Crk-transformed cells was
serially immunoprecipitated with anti-Dok1 antibody. This treatment depleted the 64 kDa
tyrosine-phosphorylated protein from the lysates, verifying its identity as Dok1 (Fig. 1c).
Immunoblotting with a phosphospecific antibody recognizing pY362 of human Dok1
(pY361 in mouse Dok1) further confirmed the dependence of Dok1 phosphorylation on Abl
activity (Fig. 1d).
Dok1 corresponded to the only prominent tyrosine-phosphorylated band in CrkI-transformed
cells that was Abl-dependent. Somewhat paradoxically, Dok1 phosphorylation was
increased in CrkI-transformed cells compared to normal control cells (Fig. 1b). Together,
these data suggest that tyrosine phosphorylation of Dok1 by Abl is induced by CrkI
overexpression, and may act to partially suppress Crk-mediated transformation.

Phosphorylation of Dok1 regulates CrkI transformation

Author Manuscript

To test whether Dok1 is acting as a tumor suppressor protein in this system, we knocked
down Dok1 expression in CrkI overexpressing cells using shRNA (Fig. 2b). We observed an
enhancement of soft agar colony formation upon Dok1 knockdown, comparable to the effect
of Abl knockdown or imatinib treatment (Fig. 2c), implicating Dok1 as a crucial regulator of
CrkI transformation.
To further probe the significance of Dok1 in suppressing CrkI-mediated transformation, the
human homolog of Dok1 (hDok1) was used for rescue experiments. We used human instead
of mouse Dok1 to avoid its being targeted for shRNA-mediated knockdown. The human
homolog of Dok1 has an insertion at position 271, which shifts the amino acid numbering Cterminal to the insertion by +1 compared to mouse. For simplicity, henceforth the mouse
amino acid numbering will be used unless stated otherwise.

Author Manuscript

In addition to the wild-type (WT) hDok1, we also generated mutant constructs to test the
importance of several potential tyrosine phosphorylation sites. Shinohara et al. (41) reported
that phosphorylation of tyrosines 259 and 361 was required for RasGAP binding, while
phosphorylation of tyrosines 336 and 340 inhibited Erk activation through unidentified
mechanism(s). Both Ras and its activator Sos1 were previously shown to play essential roles
in Crk transformation (11, 42), and the MEK/ERK pathway downstream of Ras is well
known to promote cell proliferation (43).

Author Manuscript

Using site-directed mutagenesis, putative tyrosine phosphorylation sites were changed to
phenylalanine. The resulting constructs were named according to the tyrosines mutated (Fig.
2a): M14 for mutation of sites 1 and 4 (Y295 and Y361), M23 for mutation of sites 2 and 3
(Y336 and Y340), M-all for mutation of all four sites, M1 for mutation of Y295, and M4 for
mutation of Y361. These constructs were re-expressed in the CrkI-transformed Dok1
knockdown cells (Fig. 2b) and cells assayed for anchorage-independent growth in soft agar
(Fig. 2c). Expression of the WT Dok1 or the M23 mutant rescued the phenotype (enhanced
CrkI transformation) caused by Dok1 knockdown; in fact, transforming activity of rescued
cells was even lower than cells expressing endogenous amounts of Dok1. On the other hand,
knockdown cells expressing the M14 and M-all mutants showed an even greater increase in
colony formation than seen with Dok1 knockdown alone. Expression of single mutants (M1
and M4) partially rescued the Dok1 knockdown phenotype. These results suggested that
Y295 and Y361 work together to suppress CrkI tumorigenesis when phosphorylated. Dok1
knockdown followed by re-expression of WT or mutant Dok1 in control NIH3T3 cells
yielded no colonies (data not shown), consistent with the effect of Dok1 tumor suppression
being specific to cells transformed by Crk.

Author Manuscript

We also tested the effect of simple Dok1 overexpression in CrkI-transformed NIH3T3 cells
(Fig. 2d). Consistent with its role as a putative tumor suppressor, over-expression of WT
Dok1 and the M23 Dok1 mutant both suppressed CrkI transformation in the soft agar assay;
by contrast, the M14 and M-all mutants enhanced CrkI transformation (Fig. 2e). This
demonstrates that expression of Dok1 mutants that cannot be phosphorylated at sites 295
and 361 exerts a dominant-negative (pro-oncogenic) effect over endogenous Dok1.
Surprisingly, overexpression of the M1 and M4 single mutants showed a greater suppression

of transformation than seen for WT Dok1. Once again, these results were CrkI-dependent, as
no colonies were seen in control 3T3 cells overexpressing Dok1 mutants (data not shown).
SH2 domain binding partners of tyrosine-phosphorylated Dok1
Most tyrosine-phosphorylated sites function in signaling by binding to the SH2 or PTB
domains of effector proteins (44). To assess what SH2 domains bind to the Dok1 sites
implicated in suppressing CrkI transformation, we carried out a dot-blot SH2 profiling assay
(45) using purified glutathione S-transferase (GST)-SH2 or GST-PTB domain fusion
proteins to probe synthetic tyrosine-phosphorylated peptides corresponding the four sites of
interest in Dok1 (Fig. 3a).

Author Manuscript

Of the 123 SH2 or PTB probes tested (supplemental figure S1), a few showed strong
binding to Dok1-derived phosphopeptides. Abl and Arg (Abl2) SH2 domains strongly
bound to all four phosphorylated sites, but not the unphosphorylated control peptides (Fig.
3c). As expected, the SH2 domains of RasGAP bound strongly to pTyr 295 and 361. The Cterminal RasGAP SH2 domain bound specifically to pTyr 295, while the N-terminal domain
was less specific and bound to phosphopeptides corresponding to tyrosines 295, 340 and
361. SH2 domains of p85α, a subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, also bound to
phosphorylated sites in Dok1. The N-terminal SH2 domain of p85α bound pTyr 336, while
a construct encompassing both SH2 domains bound pTyr 295, 336, and 361. Notably, none
of the phosphopeptides tested bound strongly to the Crk SH2 domain (Fig. 3c). The
unphosphorylated peptides did not bind appreciably to any of the SH2 domain probes,
highlighting the specificity of our SH2 probes for tyrosine-phosphorylated peptides.

Author Manuscript

We also performed far-Western blotting to probe imatinib-treated cell lysates with RasGAP
SH2 domains. The RasGAP SH2 probes bound to a band in Crk-transformed cells
corresponding to phosphorylated Dok1; binding was abolished when Abl-mediated
phosphorylation was inhibited with imatinib (Fig. 3d). The relatively less specific RasGAP
N-terminal SH2 domain showed the strongest difference in binding to Dok1 when cells were
treated with imatinib. This suggests that in vivo, Abl preferentially phosphorylates site 4
(Y361) relative to site 1 (Y295), since little binding was seen with the RasGAP C-terminal
SH2 probe which is highly specific to site 1. A similar pattern of binding was also observed
in the control 3T3 cell lysates, albeit at a much lower intensity.
Role of RasGAP in regulating Crk transformation

Author Manuscript

We next sought to confirm that RasGAP binds to phosphorylated Dok1 in our cell system by
expressing HA-tagged hDok1 and immunoprecipitating with anti-HA antibody. To
maximize the detection of phosphotyrosine-dependent interactions, cells were treated briefly
with pervanadate (POV) before lysis to inhibit endogenous tyrosine phosphatases.
Immunoblotting of anti-HA immunoprecipitates with anti-RasGAP antibody demonstrated
association between RasGAP and WT Dok1; this binding was decreased, however, when
tyrosines 295 and 361 were mutated (mutants M14 and M-all) (Fig. 4a). These results are
consistent with the results of phosphopeptide binding experiments (Fig. 3). The M1 and M4
mutants of Dok1 both associated with RasGAP to a similar extent as WT Dok1,

demonstrating that, under these conditions, phosphorylation of either Y295 or Y361 alone is
sufficient to mediate RasGAP binding.
Next we knocked down RasGAP in both the control and CrkI overexpressing cells (Fig. 4b).
Loss of endogenous RasGAP in CrkI-transformed NIH3T3 increased the number of colonies
(Fig. 4c), similar to what was observed in Abl and Dok1 knockdowns (Fig. 2c). This
observation is consistent with a model in which Abl works through Dok1 and RasGAP to
regulate CrkI transformation.
Ras activation in CrkI-transformed cells

Author Manuscript

While the previous results all suggest a role for elevated Ras activity in Crk transformation,
over many experiments we did not detect significant differences in total Ras or Erk activity
in CrkI-transformed cells relative to control, or under conditions where Abl or Dok1 activity
was manipulated (see supplemental figure S2). We therefore considered whether CrkI
overexpression might induce localized differences in Ras activity that were not evident in
total cell lysates. To study the spatiotemporal aspects of Ras activation, we employed a
newly developed FRET sensor for activated Ras (Dora-Ras) and conducted live cell imaging
of Ras activation during cell spreading on fibronectin. Since Ras is activated on the plasma
membrane, we used total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) excitation in our imaging
studies to reduce imaging artifacts typically associated with wide-field imaging. Fifteen
minutes after plating, cells transiently transfected with Dora-Ras sensor showed elevated
ratio (FRET/CFP) values, indicative of Ras activation, in lamellipodial protrusions (Fig. 5a).
In contrast, cells transfected with a control construct (with a point mutation in the Ras
binding domain that abolishes sensor response), showed no polarized distribution of ratio
values (Fig. 5b).

Crk is known to localize to adhesions by binding to phosphorylated paxillin and
p130Cas(46-49), and we showed that CrkI was enriched at paxillin-containing adhesions in
CrkI-overexpressing cells (supplemental movie S3). In order to relate sites of Ras activation
to the location of adhesions, we co-expressed mCherry-tagged paxillin with the Dora-Ras
sensor. In control NIH3T3 cells, Ras activity co-localized with nascent adhesions at the
leading front, but diminished in the vicinity of mature focal adhesions as the cells spread
(Fig. 5c and supplemental movie S4). In contrast, CrkI-transformed cells maintained
elevated Ras activation while adhesions matured (Fig. 5d and supplemental movie S5).
Strikingly, the spatial distribution of Ras activation often appeared bipolar or multipolar, and
the cells developed multiple protrusions at an early stage of cell spreading. Thus we
conclude that the localized distribution of activated Ras is dramatically different in CrkItransformed cells compared to their normal controls.

Discussion
Unregulated Abl activity causes CML and other malignancies in humans, and small
molecule Abl inhibitors are now widely used to treat cancer. In this context, our previous
finding that Abl downregulation enhanced transformation by Crk (11) was both surprising
and potentially disturbing, as it raised the possibility that Abl inhibitors could promote
instead of inhibit tumor growth in some situations. In fact, such a tumor-promoting effect of

Abl inhibition had been reported in several previous studies, where Abl family kinases acted
downstream of Epithelial Growth Factor (EGF) (49), Transforming Growth Factor-β (TGFβ) (50) or EphrinB (EphB) (51). In each case, enhanced xenograft growth was reported upon
downregulation of active Abl and/or Arg. Our current results add to our understanding of the
complex mechanisms whereby Abl family kinases can both positively and negatively impact
different aspects of cell transformation.

Author Manuscript

We have now identified Dok1 as the downstream effector responsible for enhancing CrkI
transformation upon Abl inhibition. Dok1, Dok2 and Dok3 knockout mice were shown in
two independent studies to develop lung tumors (38) and histiocytic sarcomas (39), and the
Dok1 gene maps to human chromosome 2p13, a frequent site of translocations in leukemia
(52). Frameshift mutation (53) and aberrant DNA methylation in the promoter region (54,
55) were reported for Dok1 in various human cancers. Taken together, these results are
consistent with our current observation that Dok1 plays an important role in downregulating
CrkI-induced cell transformation.

Author Manuscript

In Fig. 6 we propose a model for how Abl regulates transformation through Dok1
phosphorylation. The overexpression of CrkI leads to its recruitment and clustering at
membrane sites rich in tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins, such as focal adhesions. Crk in
turn recruits its SH3-binding effectors such as Sos to these sites, leading to localized
activation of Ras and ultimately resulting in cell transformation. At the same time, however,
Crk triggers a negative feedback loop by recruiting Abl family kinases, which associate with
and phosphorylate Dok1. Phosphorylated DokI recruits RasGAP, which counteracts the
stimulation of Ras by Sos and thereby blunts Crk transformation. When Abl-mediated
phosphorylation is inhibited (either by knockdown or imatinib), the resulting decrease in
Dok1 phosphorylation prevents it from recruiting RasGAP, thereby increasing local Ras
activation and enhancing transformation. Interestingly, we have noticed that CrkI
overexpression reproducibly causes a modest increase in endogenous Dok1 expression in
addition to increased Dok1 phosphorylation (see Fig. 2b and 2d), consistent with a negative
feedback response to CrkI transformation.

Author Manuscript

While our data demonstrate a strong negative correlation between phosphorylated Dok1 and
CrkI transformation, it is unclear what role this pathway plays in other types of cell
transformation. On the one hand, we previously showed that imatinib had little effect on the
anchorage-independent growth of cells transformed by Src or Ras (11), and preliminary
experiments with a panel of human cancer cell lines showed that Abl inhibitors do not
generally stimulate the growth of tumor cells (KN and BJM, unpublished observations).
However, previous results showing that Dok proteins can negatively regulate signaling from
the BCR and TCR, and that they exhibit tumor suppressor activity, suggest a more general
role in feedback regulation of the Ras pathway. It is possible that the repressive role of Dok
is particularly evident in Crk transformation because Crk is a relatively weak oncogene in
mammalian fibroblasts.
Greulich and Hanafusa previously showed that dominant-negative Ras mutants blocked
transformation by v-Crk (42), and we later showed that Sos1, the major guanine nucleotide
exchange factor (GEF) for Ras, is by far the most critical SH3 binding protein of those

tested for CrkI transformation (11). However, the specific role of Ras activation in Crk
transformation remains enigmatic, as we and others have not seen a consistent or significant
increase in the activity of Ras or its downstream effectors in Crk-transformed cells relative
to controls (11, 42, 56). Our current results further implicate Ras activity in Crk
transformation by demonstrating that phosphorylation of two sites in Dok1 that bind the Ras
inhibitor RasGAP (tyrosines 295 and 361) is critical for suppressing Crk transformation. We
show that Dok1 is highly phosphorylated in Crk-transformed cells, and that this
phosphorylation is abrogated by the Abl inhibitor imatinib, which stimulates Crk
transformation. We also show that overexpression of Dok1 mutants that cannot be
phosphorylated at the Ras-GAP binding sites strongly stimulates Crk transformation, while
expression of WT Dok1 or Dok1 mutants in which these sites are intact strongly inhibits
anchorage independent growth induced by CrkI overexpression. Finally, we also show that
RasGAP knockdown enhances CrkI transformation (Fig. 4c).

Author Manuscript

Interestingly, Dok1 knockdown cells rescued with Dok1 mutated at tyrosines 295 and 361
(M14 and M-all) were even more transformed than the Dok1 knockdown alone (Fig. 2). A
likely explanation is that the Dok1 mutants have a dominant-negative effect on the residual,
endogenous Dok1 present in knockdown cells. The fact that simple overexpression of these
Dok1 mutants had similar effects, even in the presence of unaltered endogenous Dok1, is
also consistent with this idea. Phospho-dependent homotypic and heterotypic
oligomerization between Dok1 and Dok2 is reported to be critical for their function (57), so
the presence of mutated Dok1 would likely disrupt the integrity of oligomers and
compromise their normal ability to downregulate signaling.

Author Manuscript

One way to reconcile the apparent importance of Ras in Crk transformation with the lack of
obvious elevation in total Ras activity in Crk-transformed cells is to suppose that Ras
activation by CrkI is highly localized and therefore not apparent in whole cell lysates.
Indeed, during cell spreading we noted striking differences in the localization of activated
Ras in Crk-transformed cells relative to controls (Fig. 5). In general, upon spreading control
cells rapidly formed a single leading edge where Ras activity was highest, while mature
focal adhesions with the highest concentration of paxillin and Crk were mostly found along
the sides and trailing edge of the cell, away from the areas of highest Ras activity. Others
have previously noted that activated Ras is enriched in lamellipodia and the leading edge of
polarized cells (58, 59). In CrkI-transformed cells, however, most cells formed multiple
highly protrusive fronts with high Ras activity, which in some cases coincided with mature
focal adhesions. This phenotype is consistent with the partial loss of a negative feedback
loop that normally functions to repress Ras at focal adhesions after a brief burst of activity.

Author Manuscript

The predominant form of Crk in normal cells, CrkII, contains a C-terminal region with a
negative regulatory Abl phosphorylation (60, 61). The highly related CRKL protein also
contains a homologous tyrosine phosphorylation site (62, 63). In normal cells, CrkII or
recruited to focal adhesions is likely to be rapidly downregulated by Abl, and thus can only
transiently recruit effectors such as Sos to adhesions. CrkI, by contrast, lacks this negative
regulatory site. Thus in cells overexpressing CrkI, one might expect relatively sustained Ras
activation at sites where Crk is localized, such as focal adhesions. In these cells however,
Dok1 phosphorylation appears to trigger a slower, less efficient downregulatory mechanism

for Ras via the recruitment of RasGAP. Inhibition or knockdown of Abl family kinases,
Dok1, or RasGAP inhibits this second feedback loop, and likely exacerbates the
mislocalization of Ras activation seen in CrkI overexpressing cells. Further experiments will
be needed to tease out the effects of this local feedback inhibition on proliferative signaling,
and on cell motility and polarity in general.

Author Manuscript

Our results suggest that CrkI overexpression has both positive and negative effects on cell
transformation, through different sets of protein interactions. Inputs that interfere with some
of these interactions will shift this equilibrium, pushing the cell toward one extreme or the
other (normal vs. tumorigenic). Consistent with this idea, Crk transformation of mammalian
cells is relatively weak, presumably at least in part because of the negative feedback
provided by phosphorylation of Dok1 by Abl. The ability of Crk to transform cells is likely
to depend not only on the level of Crk overexpression, but also on the relative abundance of
positive effectors such as Sos, versus potential negative regulators such as Abl, Dok1, and
RasGAP. Our results highlight the importance of understanding the role of negative
feedback loops when considering therapies that incorporate Abl inhibition for the treatment
of human tumors.

Methods and Materials
Cell culture, transfection, and viral infection

Author Manuscript

NIH3T3 fibroblasts were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% super calf serum
(SCS) (Gemini Bio-products). Serum starvation was carried out by maintaining the cells in
DMEM with 0.1% serum overnight. Transient transfection was performed using
Lipofectamine 2000 (Life Technologies) according to the manufacturer's instructions.
Retrovirus stocks were produced and used to infect cells as described (11).
DNA constructs
The CrkI MSCVpuro retroviral vector has been described (11). Dok1 and its mutants were
cloned into MSCVneo vector (Clontech). The tyrosine-to-phenylalanine Dok1 mutants were
generated from WT cDNA (38) using standard site-directed PCR mutagenesis with Platinum
Taq polymerase (Life Technologies). The GFP- and Cherry-paxillin constructs were
generous gifts of Klaus Hahn (UNC-Chapel Hill).
Construction of Dora-Ras

Author Manuscript

The Dora-Ras sensor is based on established design principles (58, 64). It contains an Nterminal Ras binding domain (RBD, Cys71-Ser161) derived from Byr2, followed by a
fluorescent protein FRET pair (Cerulean3-Venus), and an intact, wild-type H-Ras at the Cterminus. To improve the dynamic range, structural optimization was used to couple the
dimerization of fluorescent proteins with the interaction between Byr2 and activated H-Ras
(65), hence the name Dimerization Optimized Reporter for Activation (Dora). The detailed
characterization of the sensor will be described elsewhere (manuscript in preparation). As a
control, a point mutation (R83E) was introduced in the RBD to disrupt Ras binding. The
mutant sensor controls for potential alterations of fluorescence in the cell that are
independent of Ras activation.

crystal violet (Sigma-Aldrich), photographed, and colony numbers were calculated using
ImageJ (NIH, Bethesda, MD, USA). For imatinib (LC laboratories) treatment, drug was
present at the indicated concentration both in the initial plating medium and in medium used
for weekly feeding.
SH2-phosphopeptide binding assay and far-western blotting

Author Manuscript

Biotinylated synthetic peptides were synthesized in both phosphorylated and
unphosphorylated forms (Genescript), carefully spotted onto a gelatin-coated nitrocellulose
membrane and fixed with 4% paraformaldehide for 5 min. The membrane was subjected to
binding with a panel of GST-tagged pTyr binding domains as described (45). Far-western
blotting (Fig. 3D) was carried out as described previously (45) using HRP-conjugated antiGST antibody for detection.
Protein analysis

Author Manuscript

Cell lysis, immunoblotting, and immunoprecipitation were performed as previously
described (11). For co-IP (Fig. 4a), cells were first treated with 200 μM pervanadate (POV)
for 45 min before lysis. Equal amounts of lysate were pre-cleared for 2 h with Protein-A
beads, then, supernatant was incubated with anti-HA and Protein-A beads overnight. The
next day, beads were washed 4X with a high-salt KLB solution (500 mM NaCl) and once
with standard KLB solution before addition of 5X sample buffer.
Live cell imaging and sensor data processing
Cells were seeded onto fibronectin (20 μg/ml) coated coverslips in phenol red- and vitaminfree DMEM imaging medium (US Biological). TIRF (total internal refection fluorescence)
imaging was conducted on a customized Ti-E inverted microscope (Nikon, Japan) equipped
with a multiline (440/515/594 nm) LMM5 laser merge module (Spectral Applied Research,
Canada), a motorized XY stage (Ludl, Hawthorne, NY), and a Stable Z stage heater

(Bioptechs, Butler, PA). Images were acquired through a 60x 1.49 NA TIRF objective
(Nikon) on an iXon Ultra 897 EMCCD (Andor, Belfast, UK) under the control of
MetaMorph software (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). Biosensor data were processed
using custom routines written in MetaMorph and MATLAB (MathWorks, Natick, MA) for
background subtraction, image segmentation, channel registration, and ratiometric
arithmetic as described previously (68).

with anti-RasGAP. RasGAP binding to Dok1 was decreased when tyrosines 295 and 361
were both mutated (M14 and M-all). Cells were treated with pervanadate prior to lysis to
increase total pTyr levels. Bottom: bands from two independent experiments were
quantified; average RasGAP/HA ratio was normalized to WT Dok1. b) Western blotting
demonstrating knockdown of RasGAP. E: empty vector control NIH3T3 cells; EGi:
RasGAP knockdown control cells; C: CrkI-transformed cells; CGi: CrkI-transformed,
RasGAP knockdown cells. c) Soft agar colony formation results for cells shown in panel b.
RasGAP knockdown increases the number of colonies in CrkI-transformed cells but has no
effect on the empty vector control cells.

Figure 5. Ras activation is partially uncoupled from the turnover of adhesions in CrkItransformed cells

Author Manuscript

NIH3T3-vector (a-c, n = 18 cells) or -CrkI (d, n = 18 cells) cells were co-transfected with
the Dora-Ras FRET sensor (a, c and d) or sensor control (b, n = 9 cells) and mCherry-tagged
paxillin. The cells were seeded onto fibronectin-coated coverslips and imaged with TIRF
excitation 15 minutes after plating. The ratio (FRET/CFP) images were calculated and
presented in pseudocolor based on the lookup table provided (a and b, right; c and d,
bottom). CFP and mCherry intensities were illustrated in grayscale and inverted grayscale
images, respectively. The arrows (a and b) indicate directions of cell movement and the
arrowheads (c and d), clusters of focal adhesions. Scale bar, 10 μm.

Figure 6. Phosphorylated Dok1 regulates CrkI-transformation

Author Manuscript

A) CrkI (blue) overexpression nucleates formation of localized protein complexes, including
those directly bound (Sos and Abl shown here) and indirectly bound (Dok1 and RasGAP).
While Sos serves as a crucial positive effector for CrkI-transformation, phosphorylated
Dok1 acts as a negative regulator, likely by inhibiting the Ras pathway by recruiting
RasGAP. The net output of the complex is relatively weak transformation. B) When Abl
family kinase activity is inhibited (by knockdown or inhibition), Dok1 is no longer highly
phosphorylated and thus loses its ability to repress cell transformation, shifting the balance
further toward strong transformation.
