BACKGROUND: The current treatment of metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC) with vascular endothelial growth
factor (VEGF)-targeted agents is continuous therapy until progression of disease (PD) or unacceptable toxicity.
Chronic mild to moderate toxicity and risk of long-term toxicity ensue for some patients. It is hypothesized that
patients with an initial response to treatment can maintain disease control off all therapy for a period of time.
METHODS: A retrospective study of patients with mRCC who initiated VEGF-targeted therapy between January
2004 and December 2009 at The Cleveland Clinic Foundation, Cleveland, Ohio, or Institut Gustave-Roussy, Villejuif,
France, was conducted. Patients had achieved RECIST (Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors)-defined stable
disease or better on therapy, and were then taken off all therapy for reasons not including disease progression.
Patient, disease, and therapy characteristics were recorded. The primary objective was progression-free survival
(PFS), measured as the time from discontinuation of therapy to RECIST-defined PD. RESULTS: Forty patients were
identified. After a median follow-up of 29.7 months (range, 4.2 to 84.7 months), 25 patients (63%) had PD off therapy
(median PFS, 10.0 months; range, 1.4-27.2 months). Among these patients, 8 (32%) had progression in sites that were
not previously involved with disease. Heng risk group (hazard ratio, 2.49; 95% confidence interval, 1.19-5.22; P ¼.011)
and achievement of a complete response prior to discontinuing therapy (hazard ratio, 0.20; 95% confidence interval,
0.04-0.86; P ¼.025) were independent predictors of PFS in a multivariable Cox proportional hazards model. CONCLUSIONS: A select subset of mRCC patients achieving stable disease or better on VEGF-targeted therapy can be

Current practice in the treatment of metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC) with vascular endothelial growth factor

(VEGF)-targeted agents is continuous treatment until progression of disease (PD) or unacceptable toxicity.1 VEGF-targeted therapy is currently employed as an empiric sequence of monotherapies, with an initial progression-free survival
(PFS) of approximately 11 months and subsequent PFS of approximately 5 to 7 months2,3 with overall survival extending
beyond 2 years. These data were generated in clinical trials in which patients were treated continuously until toxicity or
disease progression, and often subsequently received multiple additional therapies continuously until further progression.
Despite the greatly enhanced disease control and robust objective response rates, VEGF-targeted therapy is not felt to be
curative for patients with mRCC. Acute and chronic toxicity is encountered with ongoing therapy. Furthermore, a relatively high percentage of patients treated with these agents have to discontinue treatment secondary to adverse events.1
Given the balance of toxicity and benefit with VEGF-targeted therapy in patients with mRCC, studies have investigated discontinuation of therapy. In a group of 12 patients who achieved a complete response (CR) on sunitinib or sorafenib with or without surgical metastasectomy, the median time to progression off all therapy was 6 months.4 In a more
recent series of 64 patients who achieved a complete response on VEGF-targeted therapy, the median time until

progression off therapy was 8.5 months.5 On the basis of
these considerations, it was hypothesized that a subset of
patients with an initial response to VEGF-targeted therapy can maintain disease control off all therapy for a
period of time.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
A retrospective study was conducted of patients with
mRCC who initiated VEGF-targeted therapy between January 2004 and December 2009 at The Cleveland Clinic
Taussig Cancer Institute (Cleveland, Ohio) or Institut
Gustave-Roussy (Villejuif, France). Patients had achieved
disease control on therapy, defined as Response Evaluation
Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) stable disease (SD),
partial response (PR), or CR. Patients were then taken off
all therapy for reasons other than RECIST-defined PD and
started a period of expectant management. Clinical followup, including restaging imaging studies, were performed at
the discretion of the treating physician and generally
included CT scans of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis performed every 3 to 4 months. Patient, disease, and treatment
characteristics were recorded. Variables of interest included
current therapy (the therapy that was held at the beginning
of expectant management), reason for discontinuation of
therapy, sites of metastatic involvement prior to discontinuation of therapy, and Heng risk group6 at the time of initiation of current therapy. In addition, the history of
systemic treatment prior to current VEGF-targeted therapy, prior nephrectomy, tumor histology, and dates of diagnosis of metastatic disease, initiation of therapy,
discontinuation of therapy, progression of disease, and
most recent staging imaging were recorded. The study cutoff date was December 31, 2010.
PFS was measured as the time from discontinuation
of therapy to investigator-assessed RECIST PD and was
the primary objective of the study. A Cox proportional
hazards ratio model was used for statistical analysis to
investigate the association of variables of interest with PFS
off therapy. The analysis was performed using STATA
software, version 10.
RESULTS
A total of 40 patients were identified and were included in
the analysis: 18 patients (45%) from the Institut GustavRoussy and 22 (55%) from The Cleveland Clinic. Patient
characteristics were typical of an mRCC population, with
a male predominance and a median age of 64 years at the
time current therapy was initiated. All patients had clear

3278

cell histology, had undergone prior nephrectomy, and
had a Karnofsky performance status of 80% or better.
Eighteen patients (45%) were considered of favorable risk
on the basis of Heng criteria,6 20 (50%) were intermediate risk, and 2 patients (5%) were in the unfavorable prognostic group. The most common sites of metastatic
disease were lung, lymph node, and pancreas.
The populations from the 2 centers were different
with respect to RECIST status at the time of discontinuation of current therapy, with significantly more patients
achieving CR on VEGF-targeted therapy at The Cleveland Clinic (P ¼ .015), more patients with a prior history
of VEGF targeted therapy at The Cleveland Clinic
(P ¼ .004), and significantly more patients receiving sunitinib at The Cleveland Clinic (P ¼ .007). Otherwise,
there were no significant differences between the patients
from each institution.
A total of 45% of patients had received no prior
systemic therapy. Eight patients (20%) had a history of
VEGF-targeted therapy received before the current VEGFtargeted therapy that was held for expectant management.
Fifteen patients (38%) had a history of metastasectomy.
The VEGF-targeted therapy held at the beginning
of the observation period included sunitinib (55%), bevacizumab (23%), and sorafenib (18%). One patient (3%)
was treated with sunitinib plus bevacizumab as part of a
clinical trial. The median duration of VEGF-targeted
therapy was 14.6 months (range, 2.8-79 months). At the
time current therapy was stopped, 6 patients (15%) had
achieved a CR, 29 (73%) had achieved PR, and 5 (13%)
had SD as the best objective response (Table 1).
As noted, patients discontinued the current VEGFtargeted therapy for reasons other than RECIST-defined
PD (Table 2). In most cases (73%), discontinuation of
therapy could be attributed to toxicity. Where precise
attribution was not possible, the reason for discontinuation of therapy was considered personal preference (15%).
There were also patients in whom therapy was held
for a procedure and was not restarted (10%). In 1 patient
(3%), therapy was held for economic reasons (high copayment for oral medication).
Clinical Outcome During the Observation
Period
After a median follow-up of 29.7 months (range, 4.2-84.7
months), 25 patients (63%) had RECIST-defined PD
(median PFS, 10.0 months; range, 1.4-27.2 months)
(Fig. 2). There was no evidence on radiographic imaging
or clinical examination of a ‘‘flare’’ phenomenon (rapid

given the low volume and pace of disease. Seventeen
patients started subsequent treatment including local
therapies (surgery, radiofrequency ablation, and radiation
therapy), and systemic therapies sunitinib, sorafenib,
pazopanib, and everolimus. Among systemic agents,
sunitinib was the most commonly used agent, with 10
patients, 7 of whom were previously on sunitinib immediately prior to the period of expectant management. Full
information on response to reinitiation of systemic therapy is not available at the time of this report. All 15
patients who did not have PD are continuing the expectant management at the time of this report.

Analysis of Factors Associated With Duration
of Time Until RECIST-Defined PD Off Therapy
A univariate analysis was conducted to investigate the relationship between clinical variables and time from discontinuation of therapy until PD (Table 3). Using P ¼ .05 as
a cutoff, the factors that were associated with PFS were
worse Heng risk group (hazard ratio [HR], 2.49; 95% CI,
1.19-5.22; P ¼ .02), presence of bone metastases (HR,
6.26; 95% CI, 1.20-32.74; P ¼ .03), and lack of achievement of a CR prior to discontinuing therapy (HR, 0.20;
95% CI, 0.04-0.86; P ¼ .03). Using a stepwise selection

3280

algorithm with P ¼ .05 as the criteria for a factor to enter
and stay in the model, only more favorable Heng risk
group (HR, 2.24; 95% CI, 1.05-4.80; P ¼ .04) and
achievement of a CR prior to discontinuing therapy (HR,
0.19; 95% CI, 0.42-0.84; P ¼ .03) were independent
predictors of a longer PFS off therapy.

DISCUSSION
This retrospective analysis demonstrates that highly select
patients with mRCC can be taken off VEGF-targeted therapy and expectantly managed. After approximately 1 year
receiving VEGF-targeted therapy, patients were observed
on average for 10 months until RECIST-defined PD.
The patients included in this retrospective review
are more inclusive than those in a similar study published
recently,5 and builds on the idea that continuous VEGFtargeted therapy may not be necessary in all patients.
Instead of limiting inclusion to patients with mRCC who
achieved a complete response on VEGF-targeted therapy
as per previous reports, patients with RECIST-defined
SD or better on VEGF-targeted therapy were included.
The reasons for holding current therapy were quite
diverse. However, the majority of patients held treatment
as a result of toxicity. Often, these toxicities are lower
grade and chronic, which can significantly interfere with
quality of life. Although these toxicities are not necessarily
grade 3 toxicities that would require patients to completely discontinue therapy as in the context of a clinical
trial, it is clear that lower grade chronic toxicity is a significant limitation of VEGF-targeted therapy for many
patients. A strategy of periodic treatment breaks, therefore, may allow for a reduction in overall toxicity and
increase in patient quality of life while maintaining overall
disease control with these noncurative therapies. This hypothesis requires prospective testing. Formal quality of
life assessment was not undertaken, because this was a

retrospective study, although all patients had improvement in toxicity while off treatment.
In other solid oncology disciplines, intermittent
therapy, either for the most toxic drug in a given regimen
or for the entire regimen, is also emerging as a potentially
viable strategy. As an example, in the OPTIMOX trial,
intermittent therapy with oxaliplatin while continuing 5fluorouracil was shown to be an acceptable regimen with
reduced toxicity and similar efficacy.7 A newer study compares intermittent FOLFIRI (folinic acid, 5-fluorouracil,
and irinotecan) with standard continuous FOLFIRI and
finds equivalent results in overall survival and PFS after a
median drug holiday of 3.5 months.8 Furthermore, discontinuation of imatinib after 2 years of sustained complete molecular remission in patients with Philadelphia
chromosome–positive chronic myelogenous leukemia
resulted in a relapse-free survival of 38% at 2 years. All
patients who relapsed were successfully treated into remission upon reintroduction of imatinib.9
It would seem intuitive that patients with more indolent disease will likely take longer to progress off therapy. However, the results of time variables representing
the duration of disease (or duration of metastatic disease)
measured from the time of nephrectomy (or from the
time of diagnosis of metastatic disease) to the time of starting or holding current therapy were not statistically significant predictors of PFS. This may be due to the small
number of patients in this analysis. However, another indicator of more indolent disease, a favorable Heng prognostic risk group, was found to be a statistically significant
predictor of PFS. An observation period/intermittent
approach therefore likely takes advantage of inherently indolent biology by reducing tumor burden with treatment,
with inherent slow growth during the off period.
As reported, a ‘‘flare’’ phenomenon of disease progression, determined either radiographically or clinically, after
stopping targeted therapy was not observed. However, given
the retrospective nature of this analysis, precise characterization of this potential phenomenon is not possible. A clinical
concern with observation in patients with mRCC would be
new sites of disease in clinically relevant areas (eg, brain and
bone) that could lead to significant morbidity, which might
have been avoided with continuous therapy. Overall, 8
patients had new sites of disease that arose during expectant
management, including 1 patient each with a new brain and
bone lesion, respectively. Radiation therapy was initiated for
local management of the brain and bone metastatic lesions
in these patients. Notably, unlike PD identified in previously
uninvolved common sites of metastatic disease, new involve-

ment of bone and brain caused significant clinical symptoms
that required immediate intervention. This is a cause for
concern and is a potential limitation of expectant management. In addition, data on response to reinstituted VEGFtargeted therapy on progression of disease are incomplete,
and therefore we cannot comment on its outcomes.
This study has several limitations inherent to a retrospective study, including a small sample size and an inherent
selection bias, because many of these patients were managed
off all therapy because the clinicians were comfortable with
small volume of disease of the slow pace of disease. In addition, the frequency of imaging follow-up was at the discretion of the treating physician, which affects the reported PFS
off therapy. Furthermore, there was not a matched cohort of
patients who continued VEGF-targeted therapy to compare
clinical outcome. This latter point is important, because
treatment breaks could theoretically be associated with worse
overall outcome (eg, worse overall survival), which would be
critically important in a patient’s and doctor’s decision-making regarding the need or desire for a treatment break. Further prospective testing of this approach is therefore needed
before it can be recommended.
These data generate a hypothesis that there is a select
subset of patients with mRCC with disease control on
VEGF-targeted therapy who can be observed off all active
therapy. A more favorable prognostic risk score is associated with a longer duration of expectant management
before disease progression. Whether this approach can be
routinely applied to a less selective population will require
prospective investigation. A phase 2 clinical trial of intermittent sunitinib is currently underway at the Cleveland
Clinic (Clinicaltrials.gov identifier NCT01158222).
