BACKGROUND: Despite advances in therapy, the majority of adult patients diagnosed with acute myeloid leukemia
(AML) develop disease recurrence and die of their disease. Early intensification of treatment for AML using timed sequential therapy (TST) has been proposed as a means of improving the survival outcome in children. The Children’s
Cancer Group demonstrated that children with AML who were randomized to receive 2 courses of daunorubicin,
cytarabine, thioguanine, etoposide, and dexamethasone (the DCTER regimen) given 10 days apart had an improved
event-free survival (EFS) and disease-free survival (DFS) (42%  7% and 55%  9%, respectively, at 2 years). Reports
have suggested an improved outcome in adult patients with AML using TST (at the cost of increased toxicity). The
current study was conducted to evaluate the feasibility and effectiveness of the intensively timed DCTER regimen for
non-core–binding factor AML in adult patients aged <50 years. METHODS: Between February 2004 and August
2005, 61 patients received this timed sequential induction regimen. Their outcomes were compared with matched historical patients treated with the combination of idarubicin and cytarabine (IA). RESULTS: The median follow-up for
surviving patients was 67 months (range, 35-85 months). The timed sequential DCTER regimen had a lower complete
remission (CR) rate when compared with the IA combination,, (71% vs 80%, respectively), but this appeared to be
counterbalanced by a higher long-term leukemia-free survival rate using the intensified regimen (48% vs 30%, respectively) in patients who achieved a CR (P ¼ .06). CONCLUSIONS: The intensively timed regimen of DCTER was found
to induce durable remissions in adult patients with AML, including those patients with high-risk disease. The identification of patients who would potentially benefit from such an intensive regimen may justify the higher early risk of
early treatment failure that was found to accompany the intensified DCTER regimen in selected patients. Cancer

KEYWORDS: intensively timed chemotherapy, acute myeloid leukemia (AML), remission, outcome.

Several strategies have been evaluated to improve the outcome of patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML),
including the addition of novel agents to standard chemotherapy regimens or their intensification by the administration
of a second course of chemotherapy in induction before bone marrow recovery, or timed sequential therapy (TST).TST
delivers a second course of chemotherapy on Day 10 of treatment, presumably when noncycling blasts are recruited to the
cell cycle, to maximally kill residual leukemia cells.1,2 In children with de novo AML, TST has been shown to improve
event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS).3 In a large study by the Acute Leukemia French Association (ALFA), a
different TST strategy using cytarabine and daunorubicin did not appear to improve EFS or OS in adult patients with
AML. However, patients aged <35 years who were treated on the trial did have a significantly longer recurrence-free interval.4 Others have reported that although TST could induce disease remission in patients, it did not improve OS.5 Buchner

Timed Chemotherapy for Adults With AML/Rytting et al

et al administered a second course of chemotherapy at
Day 21 of induction regardless of the patients’ white
blood cell (WBC) count and concluded that such double
induction, given before bone marrow recovery, provided
effective treatment in adults with AML.6 Further support
for induction TST comes from its use in patients with primary refractory AML and in patients with first disease recurrence, in whom TST may successfully induce
remission.7-9 The main concern with TST in adults is excessive mucosal or myelosuppressive toxicity and consequent infection and death.7 Although the ALFA trial did
not report such toxicity, other investigators have reported
excess morbidity in adult patients receiving TST.4,10,11
Nonetheless, given the results noted with the combination
of daunorubicin, cytarabine, thioguanine, etoposide, and
prednisone (DCTER regimen), and before the ALFA trial
was reported, we conducted a phase 2 trial of TST in adult
patients aged 50 years with newly diagnosed AML.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patient Eligibility
Patients with newly diagnosed AML or high-risk myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) (using the World Health Organization criteria) who were ages 1 to 50 years were eligible.
Patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia or patients
with core-binding factor (CBF) leukemias (inv16, t[16;16]
or t[8;21]) were ineligible. Patients with a rapidly rising
WBC count could be enrolled and receive the first course
of the DCTER regimen but could not continue to the Day
10 treatment if they were found to have any of the favorable
cytogenetic abnormalities noted earlier.
There were no eligibility constraints for organ function, such as elevated creatinine or bilirubin, and there
were no restrictions for performance status (PS) at the
time of diagnosis. The study was approved by The University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center institutional review board, and informed consent was obtained
for each patient entering the trial, following the guidelines
of the Declaration of Helsinki.
Treatment Regimen
All patients were offered induction therapy in high efficiency particulate air (HEPA)-filtered rooms (protected
environment). The regimen is summarized in Table 1.
Treatment was comprised of 4 identical cycles of chemotherapy, with the first 2 cycles designated as Course 1 and
the next 2 cycles designated as Course 2. Each cycle was
comprised of daunorubicin at a dose of 20 mg/m2/day on

Days 1 through 4, cytarabine at a dose of 200 mg/m2/day

Days 1 through 4, 6-thioguanine at a dose of 100 mg/m2/
day by mouth daily on Days 1 through 4, dexamethasone
at a dose of 6 mg/m2/day by mouth daily on Days 1
through 4, and intrathecal cytarabine at a dose of 70 mg
on Day 1. As in the pediatric trial, granulocyte–colonystimulating factor (G-CSF) at a dose of 5 lg/kg subcutaneously was administered daily beginning on Day 7 and
continued until the absolute neutrophil count (ANC) was
>1000/lL for 2 consecutive days in an effort to shorten
the duration of severe aplasia; the use of G-CSF was not
intended to recruit malignant cells into the cell cycle. The
second cycle of chemotherapy was scheduled to begin on
Day 11. Only those patients with hypotension (systolic
blood pressure <90 mm Hg) or documented colitis did
not proceed to the second cycle on Day 11. Colitis was
considered to be present if fever, abdominal tenderness,
abnormal bowel sounds, and an abnormal computed tomography (CT) scan consistent with colitis were noted.
Those patients with a delay in Cycle 2 of chemotherapy
were restarted on treatment if their blood pressure stabilized or the colitis was resolving clinically before Day 21
of Course 1 or Course 2. Dose modifications in subsequent cycles for grade 3 to 4 nonhematologic toxicity or
grade 3 to 4 prolonged myelosuppression were allowed at
the discretion of the treating physician (grading determined according to the Common Toxicity Criteria for
Adverse Effects v3.0 staging system). Patients remained as
inpatients until Day 35 of therapy or until the ANC was
>1000/lL, whichever occurred first. Prophylactic antibiotics were not initiated until Day 10 of therapy to
avoid drug interactions. A bone marrow aspirate was
obtained just before Course 1 of Cycle 2. Generally, if

5273

Original Article

there was doubt regarding whether the bone marrow
was recovering with blasts or with a high number of
normal, immature precursors, a repeat bone marrow
aspirate was performed before declaring the patient as
responding or resistant to therapy. The bone marrow
aspirate was then repeated between Days 28 and 42 to
confirm disease remission.
Patients in complete remission (CR) after the second
course of chemotherapy who had recovered to an ANC
>1000/lL were then given 2 courses of consolidation
chemotherapy with cytarabine at a dose of 3 g/m2 administered intravenously over 3 hours twice daily on Days 1,
2, 8, and 9. L-asparaginase was given 6 hours after the
final dose of cytarabine on Days 2 and 9 as described by
Capizzi et al.12 The above consolidation course was
repeated at the time of recovery of the ANC to 500/lL
and the platelet count to 50  103/lL. The dose schedule
for children ages 1 to 3 years was written in mg/kg, but no
patients aged <14 years were enrolled.
Patients who did not achieve a CR at the end of the
induction TST were considered to be resistant and were
taken off the study.
Definitions
A CR was regarded as <5% blasts in the bone marrow
aspirate with an ANC >1000/lL and a platelet count
>100  103/lL with morphologically normal bone marrow and the absence of extramedullary disease. Induction
deaths were those occurring after registration on study
and before the initiation of the second course of chemotherapy. Postremission treatment-related deaths were
defined as deaths in patients in first CR occurring after
the completion of the first 2 intensively timed cycles of
chemotherapy. Recurrence-free survival (RFS) was calculated as the time in remission from CR until disease recurrence. OS was defined as the time from first diagnosis
until death from any cause.
Statistical Analysis
The primary endpoint of this phase 2 trial was to evaluate the RFS in adult patients with AML. The CR rate
and the OS rate were secondary endpoints. Because of
concerns over toxicity, safety monitoring with stopping
rules for early death or ineffectiveness were instituted for
both the intermediate-risk population and the population with a poor prognosis according to the baseline
expectations for these groups. We defined intermediate
risk as patients with normal cytogenetics or any karyo-

type other than 5/7 or complex, whereas poor prognosis was based on the presence of 5 or 7 or complex
cytogenetics (3 abnormalities). Safety monitoring for
each subgroup was performed after enrollment in increments of 5 patients. The criteria for stopping the study
early were not met and the study accrual proceeded without interruption. RFS and OS curves were generated
using the Kaplan-Meier method. These curves were then
compared with historical survival curves for similarly
aged patients with AML who were treated with idarubicin (12 mg/m2 daily  3 days) plus cytarabine (1.5 g/m2
daily  4 days) at The University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center using the log-rank test. CR rates were
compared using the Fisher exact test.

RESULTS
Patient Characteristics
Table 2 details patient characteristics at the time of diagnosis. The trial began in February 2004 and enrollment
ended in August 2005. Sixty-one patients were enrolled
on the study, and the median follow-up for the surviving
patients was 67 months (range, 35 months-85 months).
The majority of patients had a PS of 0 to 1 (54 patients;

89%), and 7 (11%) patients with a PS of 2 to 3 were enrolled. The median age was 41 years (range, 14 years-49
years). The median presenting WBC count was 7.9 thousand/lL (range, 0.7-300.5/lL). The median platelet
count was 54 thousand/lL (range, 4-295/lL). Thirteen
(21%) patients were classified as having poor-risk disease
because of the presence of 5/7 or complex abnormalities on cytogenetic evaluation, and 3 (5%) patients had
insufficient metaphases at the time of diagnosis. Using the
Medical Research Council criteria for standard-risk and
poor-risk cytogenetics, there were 15 high-risk patients
and 43 standard-risk patients.13 One patient did not
undergo cytogenetic testing and 2 patients had insufficient metaphases. Fifteen (25%) patients had either refractory anemia with excess blasts (RAEB) or RAEB in
transformation. One patient presented with central nervous system involvement manifested by the presence of leukemic cells in the spinal fluid. Three patients had AML
not otherwise classified.

Response to Intensified Induction
The first 2 patients treated on the protocol did not receive
the Day 11 therapy because of severe diarrhea. Two other
patients did not receive full doses of thioguanine because
of grade 3 diarrhea. Two patients died with pneumonia of
an unidentified pathogen before Day 11 therapy. All subsequent patients proceeded to receive the full regimen,
including Day 11 therapy. Overall, 43 (70%) patients
achieved a CR. Five (8%) patients died during or shortly
after the first 2 courses of chemotherapy at Days 2, 6, 66,
71, and 74, respectively, without achieving count recovery. Thirteen (21%) patients had no blast reduction in the
bone marrow or had increased blasts in the bone marrow
at Day 20 of therapy, and were regarded as having disease
that was resistant to therapy. Four (7%) of the resistant
patients underwent transplantation, and 1 patient was
alive at the time of last follow-up. The median time to
achieving a CR was 36 days (range, 27 days-98 days). The
5 induction deaths were attributed to infection; 3 were
caused by Candida species (1 albicans, 1 krusei, and 1 glabrata) and 2 were caused by bacterial sepsis (Enterococcus
and Pseudomonas). Among the 13 patients with poor-risk
disease, 2 (15%) died during induction and 3 (23%) had
disease that was refractory to therapy. Eight (62%)
patients achieved a CR, 2 of whom were alive at the time
of last follow-up. Three patients with poor-risk cytogenetics underwent transplantation in first CR, and 2 patients
underwent transplantation with refractory disease.

Toxicity During Induction
The principal grade 3-4 toxicities that occurred during
intensified induction are listed in Table 3. The most common nonhematologic, grade 3-4 toxicities were diarrhea
and colitis, which were encountered in 23 (38%) and 17
(28%) patients, respectively. Hyperbilirubinemia was also
relatively common, occurring in 13 (21%) patients.
Postinduction Results
At the time of last follow-up, 21 patients had died after
achieving a CR after 2 cycles of intensified induction; 18
patients developed disease recurrence and died of leukemia and 3 died in CR. In total, 36 patients who were enrolled died of either toxicity or disease recurrence. Of the
remaining 25 (41%) patients, 3 developed disease recurrence and subsequently underwent transplantation. These
transplanted patients were all free of disease at the time of
last follow-up, after >4 years off of therapy.
Long-Term Outcome
Overall, 36 (59%) patients had died either of toxicity or
disease recurrence at the time of last follow-up. At the
time of last follow-up, all of the remaining 25 (41%)
patients were at least 4 years beyond the time of initial
therapy. Figure 1 shows the OS for patients treated on this
regimen compared with a historical population matched
for age, cytogenetic risk group (no low-risk patients were
included), and performance status who were treated with
idarubicin and high-dose cytarabine (IA). Because the

protocols did not run concurrently, the treatment year
could not be matched. Figure 2 shows the RFS for
patients on the DCTER protocol versus those in the historical IA population. There was no statistically significant difference found between the OS or the RFS of the 2
groups (P .5 for both comparisons). For potential cure,
when considering all patients, the 95% confidence interval
for the difference between the 2 treatments is -0.9 to 0.34.

DISCUSSION
In this phase 2 study, we implemented a pediatric regimen
of intensively TST for AML in adults with intermediate-

5276

risk and poor-risk AML and high-risk MDS who were
aged <50 years. Concerns about toxicity in the group of
AML patients with a relatively favorable prognosis with
CBF-AML and AML-M3 precluded the inclusion of
these patients in this trial. Overall, the DCTER regimen
produced a RFS rate of 48%. This compares favorably
with the outcome of a matched cohort of patients treated
with IA. However, this is at the cost of a greater number
of induction failures because of disease resistance and infectious deaths. This induction mortality occurred despite
the use of reverse isolation inside a laminar air flow protective environment on a specialized adult leukemia ward.
The majority of deaths and toxicities were related to gastrointestinal complications. We did not initiate infection
prophylaxis until Day 10 of therapy because prior data
had suggested that infectious death is unusual before Day
10. The earlier use of infection prophylaxis may have
potentially decreased the frequency of gastrointestinal
morbidity and mortality, and could be considered in
future studies of patients undergoing intensively TST for
AML. Nevertheless, only 2 deaths occurred before the initiation of infection prophylaxis; the delay does not appear
to have been too detrimental to patient outcome.
For patients with poor-prognosis AML, intensively
TST using the DCTER regimen was found to be effective
in inducing durable remissions. The number of patients
in the current study was too small to make a conclusive
statement concerning the OS and RFS rates of the highrisk individuals. However, 2 of 8 high-risk patients who
achieved CR remained alive and free of disease at the time
of last follow-up, >4 years after therapy without transplantation. Durable remissions in high-risk AML patients
using intensively TST have been previously reported by
both Geller et al and Braess et al.14,15 This finding would
suggest that intensively TST for AML may be an effective
modality in selected high-risk patients. This is in contrast
to the recently published data from the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) that used a higher anthracycline dose in initial AML therapy and found that highrisk patients did not benefit from the intensified anthracycline.16 Information regarding FLT3 mutation status and
nucleophosmin-1 (NPM-1) mutation status in these
patients was not available at the time of the study. To the
best of our knowledge, how adult patients with or without
these mutations would fare when treated with intensively
timed induction of the DCTER regimen is not known.
Once patients achieve remission on intensively TST, the
RFS appears to compare favorably to that of patients
treated with IA. It is interesting to note that the IA

regimen contains high-dose cytarabine, which in itself has
been associated with an improved survival in younger
patients with AML compared with standard regimens
containing standard-dose cytarabine.17 This would suggest that if measures to combat early death could be used,
intensively timed use of the DCTER regimen might be an
acceptable option for a younger adult with newly diagnosed standard-risk or high-risk AML.
Finally, intensively TST using the DCTER regimen has perhaps reached a limit with regard to the intensity of conventional chemotherapy. It is clear that for
certain patients with AML, intensification of the induction regimen may provide benefit. However, for other
patients, particularly those with chromosome 5 and 7
abnormalities and complex cytogenetics, increasing the
intensity of conventional chemotherapy agents appears
to provide no additional benefit and is associated with
increasing toxicity. We have previously demonstrated
that patients with such cytogenetic abnormalities appear
to have an improved outcome when hypomethylating
agents are used for their initial treatment.18 Furthermore, the introduction of agents with specific activity
against the molecular targets responsible for neoplastic
transformation in the leukemic cells such as the FLT3 tyrosine kinase inhibitor and their incorporation into the
currently available induction regimens may benefit specific subsets of patients with AML.19,20 The identification of those patients most likely to benefit from
chemotherapy intensification and reserving such regimens for those patients, as well as strategies to minimize
the initial toxicity associated with these regimens, is
likely to be the most effective way of deriving benefit
from such a strategy.
