Despite recent advances, advanced prostate cancer is suboptimally responsive to current chemotherapeutic agents.
Radiolabeled monoclonal antibody therapy that targets prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) shows promise
and is an area of active investigation. J591 is a deimmunized IgG monoclonal antibody developed to target the
extracellular domain of PSMA. Preclinical and early phase clinical studies using radiolabeled J591 have demonstrated
efficacy in targeting tumor cells and decreasing levels of prostate-specific antigen. Radiolabeled J591 is well-tolerated, nonimmunogenic, and can be administered in multiple doses. The dose-limiting toxicity is reversible myelosuppression with little nonhematologic toxicity. Future studies will include approaches to optimize patient selection and
incorporate novel strategies to improve the success of anti-PSMA radioimmunotherapy. Cancer 2010;116(4

Prostate cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer among men in the Western world, accounting for 25% of
all new cases of cancer and 14% of deaths from cancer. There was an estimated 186,320 new cases and 28,660 deaths from
prostate cancer in 2008.1 Although many patients present with localized or indolent disease and eventually die of other
causes,2,3 there is still a significant proportion of patients that present or eventually progress to advanced metastatic disease, for which no curative treatment exists. First-line therapy for advanced prostate cancer is androgen deprivation with a
mean duration of response of 12-18 months.4 After progression, chemotherapy offers a quality of life as well as progression-free survival and overall survival benefit, although responses are transient and there is no proven therapy that
improves survival beyond initial chemotherapy.5-8
Because metastatic prostate cancer is suboptimally responsive to conventional chemotherapy, novel molecularly targeted therapies are urgently needed. Monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs) have been successful in proving therapeutic efficacy
in a variety of solid and hematologic malignancies, and antibodies targeting CD20, ErbB2, CD33, CD52, epidermal
growth factor receptor, and vascular endothelial growth factor are currently in clinical practice. MoAbs have the benefits
of being ‘‘natural’’ proteins that possess exquisite specificity and high affinity for their molecular target. In their native naked form, MoAbs possess the ability to initiate immunological effects, block receptors, or sequester ligands. Another area
of investigation is the use of tumor-targeted MoAbs as vehicles to deliver highly cytotoxic radionuclides, drugs, or toxins
to the desired cell population.9,10
Because of their success in other cancer types or in targeting prostate cancer in preclinical models, several MoAbs
have been studied in clinical trials in men with prostate cancer. Prostate cancer represents an ideal target for MoAb therapy
for numerous reasons, including the pattern of spread (bone marrow and lymph nodes, sites that typically receive high levels of circulating antibody) and the small volume of disease that is ideally suited for antibody delivery and antigen access.

Original Article

Prostate cancer is also radiation sensitive, rendering it an
excellent target for radiolabeled MoAb therapy. A surrogate marker such as PSA allows rapid clinical evaluation of
potential therapeutic efficacy.
Prostate-Specific Membrane Antigen
Prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) is a prototypical cell-surface marker of prostate cancer. It is an integral, type II membrane protein with abundant and nearly
universal expression on prostate epithelial cells and is
strongly upregulated in prostate carcinoma.11-16 In contrast to other well-known, prostate-restricted molecules
that are secretory proteins (PSA, prostatic acid phosphatase), PSMA is an integral cell-surface membrane protein
that is not secreted. This makes PSMA an ideal target for
MoAb therapy.
Pathology studies indicate that PSMA is expressed
by virtually all prostate cancers.17 Although first thought
to be entirely prostate-specific,11-13 subsequent studies
demonstrated that PSMA is also expressed by cells of the
small intestine, proximal renal tubules, and salivary
glands.15 However, the level of expression in nonprostate
tissues is 100-fold to 1000-fold less than in prostate tissue,16 and the site of PSMA expression in normal cells
(brush border/luminal location) is not typically exposed
to circulating anitbody. PSMA has also been found to be
expressed by vascular endothelial cells of various other
solid tumors, leading to the speculation that anti-PSMA
antibodies may have the potential to specifically target not
just prostate cancer but all solid tumors using a vascular
targeting approach.
The physiologic function of PSMA in prostate
tumor biology is currently unknown. PSMA expression
increases progressively in higher grade cancers, metastatic
disease, and hormone-refractory prostate cancer,13,14,18,19
suggesting that PSMA has a functional role in prostate
cancer progression.
The first antibody to PSMA that was developed in
1998 was capromab (7E11/CYT-356), a murine IgG1
produced from hybridoma. The use of this MoAb validated PSMA as an in vivo target for imaging,20,21
although clinical treatment studies have been disappointing.22,23 Capromab binds to an intracellular epitope of
PSMA, requiring internalization or exposure of the internal domain of PSMA externally, and, therefore, preferentially binds to apoptotic or necrosing cells.24,25 As a result,
capromab cannot bind viable cells and may, therefore, not
be of therapeutic benefit.11,26 Recognition of these features led to the development of other MoAbs (J591, J415,

1076

J533, and E99), which target the external domain of
PSMA, giving easier and more rapid access to the antigen.
This led to enhanced imaging and therapeutic potential.26,27 These PSMA specific antibodies could also be
labeled with various isotopes, such as 131Iodine, 177Lutetium, 90Yttrium, for use as an in vivo target for imaging.20,21 Radioisotope labeled antibodies can also be used
as a systemic treatment, emitting a or b particles, and
delivering radiation to tumor cells.
Radiolabeled J591: Preclinical and
Phase 1 Trials
Murine MoAb J591 (muJ591) was chosen for clinical development as it had been extensively studied in preclinical
models, demonstrating that it effectively targets PSMA
expressed on LNCaP cells.26 J591 has an affinity of 1 nm,
which has been shown to be an optimal affinity in therapeutic models. Lower affinity provides suboptimal
binding, while higher affinity interferes with antibody
penetration into tumor masses.28
Testing J591 radiolabeled with various isotopes has
been performed using an animal model of prostate cancer
in which athymic mice were implanted subcutaneously
with PSMA-expressing LNCaP cells. After allowing the
tumors to reach a diameter of 7-10 mm, the animals were
treated with J591 radiolabeled with different isotopes,
including 131Iodine (131I-muJ591), 177Lutetium (177LumuJ591), and 90Yttrium (90Y-muJ591). These studies
showed that 90Y and 177Lu provide better dosimetry
because of their longer intracellular half-lives and radioiodine’s relatively rapid clearance. Antitumor responses
were seen with all radionuclides with an apparent dose
response relationship. Higher cumulative doses of either
90
Y or 177Lu could be delivered using fractionated dosing
(multiple sub-maximum tolerated doses [MTD] rather
than a single MTD dose). Median survival of the animals
improved by 300% for fractionated 90Y-muJ591 therapy
(150 days vs 52 days [control]). With fractionated dose
177
Lu-muJ591, >80% of the mice were cured.29 A major
limitation of using a mouse MoAb in patients was the development of a human antimouse antibody response that
precluded repetitive dosing. Therefore, MoAb muJ591
was deimmunized by using a next generation approach to
humanization developed by Biovation, Ltd. (Aberdeen,
UK) into a humanized form (J591).30 The F(ab) region
of muJ591 was sequenced; immunoglobulin sequence
motifs recognizable by human B and/or T cells were
identified and then replaced by human homologous
sequences.

Initial phase 1 studies were performed using J591
trace-labeled with 111In using a DOTA chelate. They
showed that repetitive dosing was well-tolerated with total
doses of up to 500 mg/m2 without the development
of a human antihumanized (deimmunized) antibody
response.31,32 No dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) occurred
and the MTD was not reached. After the first dose, total
body gamma camera images were obtained within 1 hour
postinfusion (Day 0) and on 3 more occasions over the
following week. Excellent tumor targeting could be
detected at all dose levels of MoAb. No MoAb targeting
to nonprostate cancer sites was observed. As seen in other
trials using radiometals, the liver was the primary site of
excretion. Percent injected dose in the liver diminished
with increasing dose of antibody, and higher doses were
associated with longer plasma clearance times.33-35
Two independent phase 1 clinical trials were subsequently performed using 90Y or 177Lu linked via a DOTA
chelate to J591 in patients with castrate resistant prostate
cancer.36,37 The primary objectives of these trials were to
define the MTDs of the isotopes as well as to further
define dosimetry, pharmacokinetics, and human antihumanized (deimmunized) antibody of the radiolabeled
MoAb conjugates. Antitumor responses were assessed as a
secondary endpoint. The design and entry criteria of the 2
trials were identical. Eligible patients had a prior histologic diagnosis of prostate cancer and evidence of progressing recurrent or metastatic disease. As prior studies
had demonstrated that all prostate cancers were PSMApositive,17 no prospective determination of PSMA expression was done. Patients were required to have an absolute
neutrophil count 2.0  109/L, platelet count 150 
109/L. Prior radiation therapy encompassing >25% of
the skeleton or prior treatment with 89Strontium or 153Samarium was not permitted. Other standard laboratory
exclusion criteria applied as well.36,37 DLT in the 2 trials
was defined as follows: hematologic toxicity comprised
severe thrombocytopenia (platelet <10  109/L) and/or
grade 4 neutropenia (absolute neutrophil count <0.5 
109) for greater than 5 days; and other toxicity comprising
grade 3 nonhematologic toxicity attributable to
radiolabeled J591.
Patients enrolled in the 90Y-J591 phase 1 trial36
received an initial dose of 111In-J591 (20 mg, 5mCi) for
pharmacokinetic and biodistribution determinations, followed by a dose of 90Y-J591 1 week later. The dose schedule was selected to allow multiple imaging sessions before
111
In decay as well as clearance of the J591 from the initial
dose before delivering the second dose. The 90Y dose was

selected based on prior published experience with other
antibodies. The first dose used 4-5 mCi of 111In and
allowed imaging for approximately 1 week. Twenty-nine
subjects were entered at the following dose levels: 5, 10,
15, 17.5, and 20 mCi/m2. Patients were eligible for up to
3 retreatments if platelet and neutrophil recovery were satisfactory. Four patients were retreated. DLT was seen at
20 mCi/m2 with 2 patients experiencing thrombocytopenia with nonlife threatening bleeding episodes requiring
platelet transfusions. The 17.5 mCi/m2 dose level was
determined to be the maximum tolerated dose. No
retreated patients experienced DLT. Nonhematologic
toxicity was not dose limiting. Among the 29 patients
receiving 111In-DOTA-J591, 19 patients had bone
lesions and 13 patients had soft tissue lesions. Seventeen
of 19 (89%) patients with bone lesions and 9 of 13
(69%) with soft tissue lesions were accurately targeted,
resulting in an overall targeting sensitivity of 26 of 32
(81%). Two patients treated at the 20 mCi/m2 dose level
exhibited 85% and 70% declines in PSA lasting 8
months and 8.6 months before returning to pretreatment
values. In addition, these 2 patients had objective measurable disease responses with 90% and 40% decrease in
the size of pelvic and retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy.
Both patients were castrate-resistant with lymph nodeonly disease and had not received prior chemotherapy.
The second patient was retreated with 90Y-J591 on Day
119. An additional 6 patients experienced PSA stabilization by week 12.
Thirty-five patients were enrolled in the 177LuJ591 phase 1 trial.37 Patients received J591 radiolabeled
with doses of 177Lu ranging from 10 mCi/m2-75 mCi/
m2. Several patients were retreated. Of the 3 patients at
the 75 mCi/m2 dose level, 1 experienced dose-limiting
(grade 4) thrombocytopenia and 1 experienced dose-limiting neutropenia of 6 days duration. At the prior dose
level of 70 mCi/m2, 6 patients were entered. Two
patients had transient grade 4 neutropenia not meeting
the definition of DLT; 1 of these patients had grade 4
thrombocytopenia. As there was only 1 DLT in these 6
patients, the 70 mCi/m2 dose level was determined to be
the MTD. Retreatment was allowed after hematologic
recovery. Repeat dosing at 45 to 60 mCi/m2 6 to12
weeks after the initial dose resulted in dose-limiting myelosuppression; up to 3 doses of 30 mCi/m2 could be
safely administered. Clearly identified sites of metastatic
disease were successfully imaged by 177Lu-J591 scintigraphy in 100% of patients (Fig. 1). All 35 patients in this
trial had rising PSA values including 7 patients with

Choice of Radionuclide
For targeted radionuclide therapy, MoAbs and peptides
can be labeled efficiently with several radionuclides emitting beta particles (Table 1). The higher beta energy particles of 90Y may be good for bulky tumors, but it may not
be necessary or even suboptimal for small tumors and
especially bone or bone marrow metastases. The relatively
low energy beta particles of 131I are ideal, but in vivo dehalogenation of radioiodinated molecules is a major disadvantage for internalizing antibody and peptide molecules.
In contrast, 177Lu has a low energy beta particle with only
0.2-0.3 mm range and delivers much lower radiation dose
to bone marrow compared with 90Y. In addition, because
of a longer physical half-life (compared with 90Y), the tumor residence times are higher. As a result, higher activities (more mCi amounts) of 177Lu-labeled agents can be
administered with comparatively less radiation dose to
marrow. In addition to the favorable properties described
above, 177Lu has gamma emission, enabling imaging to be
performed using the treatment dose (as opposed to using
111
In followed by 90Y in the aforementioned phase 1
trial). On the basis of planned future directions (see
below), 177Lu has been chosen for further development.
However, because of the physical properties of 177Lu, one
should note that treatment of bulky metastatic castrationresistant prostate cancer is likely a suboptimal patient
population in which to test the true antitumor efficacy of
177
Lu-J591-based radioimmunotherapy (RIT).
Phase 2 Trial of 177Lu-J591 for Metastatic
Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer
Based upon the phase 1 results described above,37 a phase
2 trial was initiated at 2 centers and has now completed
enrollment.38 Subjects with progressive metastatic castra-

tion-resistant prostate cancer received 1 dose of 177LuJ591 in 2 cohorts. The MTD of the phase 1 study37 was
70 mCi/m2. However, based upon restrictions imposed
by the FDA, the initial cohort of patients on this phase 2
trial was treated with 65 mCi/m2. Cohort 1 (65mCi/m2)
enrolled 15 patients; Cohort 2 enrolled (70mCi/m2) 17
patients. The primary endpoint was PSA and/or measurable disease response; the secondary endpoint was toxicity.
A 177Lu-J591 imaging study was performed to confirm
tumor targeting. In this study, the median age was 71
years (range, 51-88), median baseline PSA 77.92 ng/mL
(range, 3.31-2184.6). All patients underwent planar
177
Lu-J591 scans after treatment. Excellent targeting of
known sites of prostate cancer metastases was observed in
30 of 32 (94%) of patients. Thrombocytopenia was the
most common severe hematologic toxicity. No significant
drug-related nonhematologic toxicity occurred. PSA
declines were observed in more patients receiving the dose
of 70 mCi/m2 (71%) compared with 65 mCi/m2 (46%).
In summary, 3 trials provide support that radiolabeled J591 is well-tolerated and nonimmunogenic.
Radiolabeled J591 effectively targets prostate cancer metastases with sensitivity and specificity and produces PSA
declines. Both 177Lu-J591 and 90Y-J591 are dose limited
by myelosuppression with little nonhematologic toxicity.
Patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer tolerate anti-PSMA RIT either before or after chemotherapy and no long-term effects on bone marrow
function have been seen.
Future Directions
The current focus of research with anti-PSMA-based RIT
is to develop strategies to improve efficacy.
Improving Patient Selection

Because PSMA expression has been described in virtually all studies evaluating expression in prostate cancer
tissue, no selection for PSMA expression has been performed to date. It is unknown if levels of expression are
associated with response to anti–PSMA-based therapy. In a
retrospective posthoc analysis of patients treated with
177
Lu-J591, the quality of imaging as determined by visual
scale and semiquantitative tumor targeting index values
(177Lu tumor counts corrected for background/total body
counts) correlated with PSA decline.39 This observation is
being further studied prospectively in ongoing trials. If the
intensity of radiolabeled J591 imaging predicts future
response, studies examining the ability to preselect appropriate patients with an imaging study to enrich the target

population will proceed. In addition, studies examining
PSMA expression in circulating tumor cells are ongoing.

observed past Cohort 4 and PSA declines achieved in subjects at doses above the initial cohort.

Dose Fractionation

Chemoradioimmunotherapy

In radiotherapy, the antitumor response is primarily
due to induction of apoptosis.40-43 However, the degree
of antitumor response after the administration of radiolabeled MoAbs depends on several variables, including total
(cumulative) radiation dose to the tumor, dose-rate, and
tumor radiosensitivity. Single-agent RIT, although useful
for slowing solid tumor growth, has not been effective in
completely eliminating large, aggressive tumors. These
tumors often have p53 mutations and are less susceptible
to apoptosis, which is the proposed mechanism of cell
death from low dose-rate radiation.44 Therefore, strategies
are being developed to optimize dosimetry to the bone
marrow and tumor by dose fractionation and/or combining RIT with chemotherapy. In addition, studies to
optimize patient selection are underway.
Bone marrow is the dose-limiting organ in RIT in
the absence of marrow reconstitution. Dose fractionation is
a practical strategy to decrease the dose to bone marrow
while increasing the cumulative radiation dose to the tumor
at an optimal dose-rate.43,45,46 Dose fractionation may
take advantage of the difference between early-responding
and late-responding tissue. The radiation effect on earlyresponding tissue can be reduced by prolonging the treatment time and dose fractionation. The radiation effect on
late-responding tissues will not be changed significantly if
the total dose is not changed.43,46 Preclinical data have
shown that dose fractionation or multiple low dose treatments can decrease toxicity while increasing the efficacy.41,47,48 Similarly, there is some clinical evidence that
bone marrow toxicity can be reduced with some modest
increase in the cumulative maximum tolerated dose.49-51
To test these concepts using J591, a phase 1 dose escalation study sponsored by the Department of Defense has
begun for men with progressive metastatic castrate resistant
prostate cancer.52 Cohorts of 3-6 patients with progressive
metastatic castrate resistant prostate cancer receive 2 doses
of 177Lu -J591 2 weeks apart: Cohort 1 (20 mCi/m2 x2),
dose escalation 5 mCi/m2 per dose per cohort. The primary
endpoint is to determine DLT and the cumulative MTD of
fractionated 177Lu -J591 RIT with pharmacokinetics and
dosimetry and secondary endpoints of efficacy. DLT is
defined as severe thrombocytopenia (platelet count <15 or
need for >3 platelet transfusions in 30 days), grade 4 neutropenia, febrile neutropenia, or grade >2 nonhematologic
toxicity. Initial results appear encouraging, with no DLT

Although there is clear efficacy of anti–PSMA-based
RIT in the treatment of metastatic castration-resistant
prostate cancer, the results are limited. All men treated to
date with mature follow-up have progressed clinically. After progression on primary hormonal therapy, chemotherapy offers a quality of life as well as survival benefit,
although responses are transient and there is no proven
therapy beyond initial chemotherapy.7,8 The combination
of taxane chemotherapy with radiotherapy has been used in
several diseases because of the radiosensitizing effects of taxane-based chemotherapy.53-55 The combination of taxane
chemotherapy with RIT has also been studied in preclinical
and early clinical studies.56-58 In addition to favorable
results from fractionated radioimmunotherapy, and the
radiosensitizing effects of taxane-based chemotherapy, it is
hypothesized that the additional debulking by chemotherapy will overcome some of the limits imposed by the physical characteristics of 177Lu. Based upon these data, a phase
1 trial of docetaxel and prednisone with escalating doses of
fractionated 177Lu-J591 will begin accrual in 2009.

1080

Salvage RIT

In the current era, the majority of relapses after local
therapy are initially ‘‘biochemical’’ only, ie, a rising PSA
despite no evidence of cancer on imaging.59,60 This clinical scenario affects approximately 50,000 men per year in
the United States alone. Although there is no proven overall survival benefit in a prospective randomized trial,
radiotherapy to the prostatic fossa as a salvage regimen can
lead to long-term disease-free survival in selected individuals.61-64 Unfortunately, most subsequently suffer systemic progression because of subclinical micrometastatic
disease outside of the radiation field.
On the basis of the demonstrated ability of J591based therapy to successfully target known sites of disease
and the clinical efficacy in the advanced setting, it is now
under investigation in the salvage setting. ‘‘Targeted
radiotherapy’’ in the form of RIT is an attractive option
with the possibility of a more effective therapy in the minimal disease (biochemical only) setting. The most studied
form of RIT to date targets the CD20 antigen (131Itositumomab and 90Y ibritumomab tiuxetan) in non-Hodgkin
lymphoma. Although approved in the relapsed setting, it
appears that these therapies have their greatest impact in
the minimal disease setting65-70

Anti–PSMA-based RIT for Prostate Cancer/Tagawa et al

Based upon acceptable toxicity and demonstrated
antitumor activity, a multicenter randomized phase 2 trial
in castrate nonmetastatic biochemically progressive disease will begin accrual in 2009. The primary objective of
this trial is to prevent or delay radiographically evident
metastatic disease. Subjects with biochemically progressive prostate cancer after local therapy and initial hormonal therapy (testosterone level <50) at high risk for early
development of metastatic disease (short PSA doubling
time or elevated absolute PSA)71 will be included. Subjects will receive ketoconazole and hydrocortisone and be
randomized to a single infusion of 177Lu-J591 or a single
infusion of trace-labeled 111In-J591 (ie, placebo). Radiolabeled J591 imaging will also be performed in all
patients, as this group of patients has no evidence of metastatic prostate cancer on traditional imaging modalities
(bone scan and CT/MRI). The utility of radiolabeled
J591 imaging to identify occult sites of disease will be
explored.
Conclusion
Prostate specific membrane antigen is the most highly
established prostate cell-surface antigen known. Radioimmunotherapeutic approaches targeting PSMA are welltolerated and demonstrate antitumor activity. Clinical
trials are underway to further improve upon efficacy and
patient selection.
