BACKGROUND: The objective of this study was to investigate the efficacy of belotecan, a new camptothecin analog,
combined with cisplatin for the treatment of chemotherapy-naive patients with extensive-disease small cell lung cancer
(ED SCLC). METHODS: Treatment consisted of belotecan 0.5 mg/m2 daily on Days 1 through 4 and cisplatin 60 mg/
m2 on Day 1 of a 3-week cycle for up to 6 cycles unless there was disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or
patient refusal. Response assessment was done every 2 cycles using the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid
Tumors, and toxicity assessment was done every cycle using the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version 3.0. RESULTS: Between September 2006 and March 2008, 30 patients participated in
the study. Among them, 21 patients achieved a partial response, and the response rate was 70% (95% confidence interval
[CI], 50.6%-85.3%); and, after a median follow-up of 20.2 months, the median progression-free survival was 6.9 months
(95% CI, 6.3-7.5 months), and the overall survival was 19.2 months (95% CI, 13.3-25.2 months). Grade 3 and 4 adverse
events included neutropenia in 23 patients, thrombocytopenia in 8 patients, febrile neutropenia in 9 patients, nausea in 3
patients, and pneumonia in 3 patients. There was 1 treatment-related death from pneumonia. However, nonhematologic
toxicity generally was mild and manageable. CONCLUSIONS: The belotecan and cisplatin combination that was studied demonstrated promising response rates and survival outcomes with a manageable toxicity profile for chemotherapy-naive patients who had ED SCLC. The authors concluded that the combination warrants further randomized

Belotecan (Camtobell; CKD602, 7-[2(N-isopropylamino) ethyl]-(20S)-camptothecin; Chong Kun Dang Corp,
Seoul, Korea) is a new camptothecin analog in which a water-solubilizing group is introduced at position 7 of the B ring of
camptothecin. In preclinical studies, belotecan was a more potent topoisomerase I inhibitor and had superior antitumor
activity compared with camptothecin and topotecan in 6 human tumor xenografts.1,2 In an early, multicenter, phase 2
study using single-agent belotecan in patients with small cell lung cancer (SCLC), good antitumor activity was observed in
chemotherapy-naive patients with a response rate of 63.6% and a median survival of 11.9 months.3 A subsequent phase 1
study of belotecan in combination with a fixed dose of cisplatin for chemotherapy-naive patients with extensive-disease
(ED) SCLC determined that the maximal tolerated dose for belotecan was 0.5 mg/m2 daily.2 Although the sample size
was small, a high response rate of 76.5% was observed, and the median survival was 15.9 months.4 On the basis of those
preliminary but promising results, we conducted a multicenter phase 2 study to investigate the efficacy and toxicity of
belotecan and cisplatin in chemotherapy-naive patients with ED SCLC.

Belotecan and Cisplatin for SCLC/Lee et al

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Eligibility
The study included chemotherapy-naive patients with
histologically or cytologically confirmed ED SCLC. Eligible patients met the following criteria: ages 18 years to
75 years; an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group
(ECOG) performance status (PS) from 0 to 2; unidimensionally measurable disease; and adequate organ
function, which was defined as an absolute neutrophil
count (ANC) 1500/mm3, hemoglobin 9 g/dL, platelet count 100,000/mm3, total bilirubin 1.5 mg/dL,
aspartate and alanine aminotransferase levels both 2fold the upper limit of normal, and serum creatinine
1.5 mg/dL or a calculated (ie, with the CockcroftGault equation) creatinine clearance 60 mL per minute. Exclusion criteria were as follows: previous or concurrent malignancy (except for nonmelanoma skin
cancer, in situ carcinoma of the cervix or breast, or other
cancer if the patient had been disease free for 5 years); a
serious medical or psychiatric illness that prevented
informed consent; or life expectancy limited to <12
weeks. Prior radiation was allowed at the discretion of
the treating physician. However, patients with brain metastasis or carcinomatosis meningitis were excluded. The
study was approved by the ethics committees of all participating centers and was performed in accordance with
the Declaration of Helsinki and Good Clinical Practice
guidelines. Written informed consent was obtained from
all patients before the study.

Treatment
Before treatment, all patients had complete history and
physical examinations; a complete blood count (CBC)
with differential cell analysis; electrolytes, glucose, and
liver and renal function tests; a staging chest and upper abdominal computed tomography (CT) scan; and a bone
scan. Treatment consisted of belotecan 0.5 mg/m2 daily
intravenously over 30 minutes on Days 1 through 4 and
cisplatin 60 mg/m2 intravenously over 2 hours on Day 1
of 3-week cycles. Each cycle was repeated if the ANC and
platelet counts had recovered to at least 1500/mm3 and
100,000/mm3, respectively. If such recovery had not
occurred, then the subsequent cycle was delayed by 1
week. If a treatment was delayed by 2 weeks and if the
ANC and platelet counts had recovered to 1000/mm2
but <1500/mm3 or to 75,000/mm3 but <100,000/
mm3, respectively, then the dose of belotecan was reduced

by 20%. However, if any grade 3 nonhematologic toxicity occurred, then the doses of the 2 agents were reduced
by 20%. Treatment interruptions or delays were not
allowed for >2 weeks, and any such episode was regarded
as unacceptable toxicity, leading to treatment discontinuation. Prophylactic use of granulocyte-colony–stimulating
factor was not allowed, but therapeutic use of it was
allowed at the discretion of the treating physician. The
treatments were given for up to 6 cycles unless there was
disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or patient’s
withdrawal of consent.
Efficacy and Toxicity Assessment
Tumor responses were assessed every 2 cycles according to
the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors: A
complete response (CR) is defined as the disappearance of
all target lesions; a partial response (PR) is defined as a
decrease 30% in the sum of the greatest dimensions of
the target lesions taking as a reference the baseline sum of
the greatest dimensions and/or the persistence of 1 or
more nontarget lesion(s); progressive disease (PD) is
defined as an increase 20% in the sum of the greatest
dimensions taking as a reference the smallest sum of the
greatest dimensions recorded since starting treatment, or
the appearance of 1 or more new lesions, and/or unequivocal progression of existing nontarget lesions; and stable
disease (SD) is defined as neither sufficient shrinkage to
qualify as PR nor sufficient increase to qualify as PD taking as a reference the smallest sum of the greatest dimensions observed seen since starting treatment. For patients
with a documented CR or PR, a confirmatory evaluation
was performed after at least 4 weeks. Disease control was
defined as the best tumor response, classified as CR, PR,
or SD, that was confirmed and sustained for 6 weeks.
Progression-free survival (PFS) was defined as the
interval between the date of starting treatment and the date
of documented disease progression or death from any cause.
Overall survival (OS) was defined as the interval between the
date of starting treatment and the date of death from any
cause. If a patient was lost to follow-up, then that patient was
censored at the date of last contact. Toxicities were assessed
every cycle using the National Cancer Institute Common
Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version 3.0. All
patients who had received drugs were included in the toxicity
analysis. Data were updated on January 13, 2009.
Statistical Considerations
The group sequential design described by Chang et al.
was used to determine the sample size and decision

criteria for the current study.5 With a target activity
level of 50% and the lowest response rate of interest set
at 30%, the study was designed in 2 stages to have an
80% power to accept the hypothesis and a 5% significance level to reject the hypothesis. During the first
stage, if 15 responses were observed in the first
30 patients, then the study would be terminated, and
further investigation would be warranted; and, if
9 responses were observed, then the study also would
be stopped early with no further investigation. Otherwise, 20 more patients would be enrolled. If
22 responses in 50 patients were observed, then we
would conclude that the treatment offered clinical
activity against SCLC. Confidence intervals (CIs)
were calculated using the binomial test, and comparisons of results were performed using the chi-square test.
Survival outcomes were calculated using the KaplanMeier method.

RESULTS
Patient Characteristics
Between September 2006 and March 2008, 30 patients
participated in the study. Patients’ characteristics are listed
in Table 1. No patient received any previous radiotherapy.
All patients received at least 1 cycle of therapy and were
assessed for toxicity. However, 4 patients were regarded as
‘‘not assessable’’ for the overall response evaluation,
because a sustained response of >4 weeks was not confirmed by a subsequent evaluation, there was a treatment
delay of >2 weeks because of persistent neutropenia
before the fourth cycle; there was a treatment delay
because of a traumatic femur fracture after slipping that
was not attributable to metastasis or treatment after the
second cycle; a patient withdrew consent after the third
cycle because of the long journey to the hospital; and exacerbation of underlying pulmonary disease after the third
cycle in 1 patient each.
Response and Survival Outcome
Of 30 enrolled patients, 21 patients achieved a PR, 2
patients had SD, and 3 patients had PD, for an overall
response rate of 70% (95% CI, 50.6%-85.3%). It is noteworthy that the responses in 4 ‘‘not assessable’’ patients were
regarded as PD, because we could not confirm their sustained responses for the reasons mentioned above, although
all of them had a PR after 2 cycles (Table 2). With a median
follow-up of 20.2 months, the median PFS was 6.89

months (95% CI, 6.3-7.5 months), and the median OS was
19.2 months (95% CI, 13.3-25.2 months) (Fig. 1).
Toxicity Profile
Toxicities were evaluated in all 30 patients over a total of
157 cycles. Toxicity profiles by patient and by cycle are
shown in Table 3. The most common toxicity was neutropenia. Grade 3 or 4 toxicity occurred in 23 patients (76%)
and 66 cycles (42%), whereas grade 3 or 4 febrile neutropenia occurred in 9 patients (30%) and 11 cycles (7%). Grade
3 or 4 nonhematologic toxicities were rather uncommon;
nausea was reported in 3 patients and 4 cycles, and hyponatremia was reported in 6 patients and 7 cycles. During the
treatment period, 1 patient died of pneumonia, which may
have been related to disease progression rather than treatment, because his chest CT scan had evidence of tumor

progression. However, a dose reduction of belotecan was
required during 35 of 157 cycles (22.3%).

Poststudy Treatment
Of 17 patients who received second-line chemotherapy after the documentation of PD, 4 patients (23.5%) achieved
a PR, 5 patients had SD, and 8 patients had PD. Two

additional PRs and 4 additional patients with SD were
observed among 11 patients in settings of third-line or
later therapy.

DISCUSSION
Belotecan is a new camptothecin analog and potently
inhibits topoisomerase I. In the current multicenter phase
2 study, we observed a high objective response rate of
70% in the intention-to-treat (ITT) cohort. Because sustained tumor responses in 4 not assessable patients were
not confirmed, the response rate in the per-protocol
cohort was rather higher at 80.8% (21 of 26 patients).
Although the response rate of 70% did not seem higher
than expected; in the ITT cohort, the median PFS of 6.9
months and the median OS of 19.2 months was rather
promising. In fact, the response rates and survival outcomes were comparable to those reported with other currently used combination regimens, although our small
phase 2 study could not be compared directly with those
in larger phase 3 studies (Table 4).6-10 It is noteworthy
that the response rate and the disease control rate with
subsequent second-line therapy (mainly etoposide and
platinum) were 23.5% and 52.9%, respectively, which
may translate into a better survival outcome. Therefore,

the better survival outcome may have been caused by salvage treatment after progression; or by the inherent bias of
the small, single-institution phase 2 study design; or by
both, which should be addressed in a large, randomized
phase 3 study.
In terms of the toxicity profile, hematologic toxicity,
and especially neutropenia, was the most common toxicity,
but the frequency was similar to that reported with other
combination regimens,6-10 and dose reductions occurred in
22.3% of all cycles. Nonhematologic toxicity was mild and
manageable. Disappointingly, this belotecan and cisplatin
combination did not demonstrate any improvement in the
toxicity profile compared with currently available regimens,
some of which have better a toxicity profile.
In conclusion, the belotecan and cisplatin regimen
that we studied demonstrated promising response rates
and a manageable toxicity profile in chemotherapy-naive
patients with ED SCLC. Further randomized trials comparing this regimen with standard treatment should be
considered cautiously.
