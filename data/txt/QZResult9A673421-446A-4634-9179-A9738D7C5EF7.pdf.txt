ABSTRACT
Lack of clinically relevant tumor models dramatically hampers development of
effective therapies for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Establishment of patientderived xenograft (PDX) models that faithfully recapitulate the genetic and phenotypic
features of HCC becomes important. In this study, we first established a cohort of
65 stable PDX models of HCC from corresponding Chinese patients. Then we showed
that the histology and gene expression patterns of PDX models were highly consistent
between xenografts and case-matched original tumors. Genetic alterations, including
mutations and DNA copy number alterations (CNAs), of the xenografts correlated well
with the published data of HCC patient specimens. Furthermore, differential responses
to sorafenib, the standard-of-care agent, in randomly chosen xenografts were
unveiled. Finally, in the models expressing high levels of FGFR1 gene according to
the genomic data, FGFR1 inhibitor lenvatinib showed greater efficacy than sorafenib.
Taken together, our data indicate that PDX models resemble histopathological and
genomic characteristics of clinical HCC tumors, as well as recapitulate the differential
responses of HCC patients to the standard-of-care treatment. Overall, this large
collection of PDX models becomes a clinically relevant platform for drug screening,
biomarker discovery and translational research in preclinical setting.

(HCC) represents the major histological subtype that
accounts for 70% to 85% of the total liver cancers [1].
Surgery is the potentially curative therapy for HCC.
Unfortunately, the majority of HCC is unresectable at
the time of diagnosis due to advanced disease stages and
unfavorable patient conditions [2]. Additionally, HCC
is intrinsically resistant to conventional chemotherapies

INTRODUCTION
Liver cancer is the fifth and seventh most frequently
diagnosed cancer in men and women, respectively,
worldwide. It is the second and sixth most frequent cause
of cancer death in men and women, respectively [1].
Among primary liver cancers, hepatocellular carcinoma

in clinic [3]. Sorafenib, a pan tyrosine kinase inhibitor,
has remained the only approved targeted agent for
advanced HCC since 2007. Despite of its application in
the clinic, the benefit of sorafenib remains modest [4].
The biomarkers predicting the prognosis and responses to
the treatment with sorafenib in HCC are virtually absent.
Recent studies have shown that a decline in serum AFP
levels from baseline may serve as a surrogate marker of
outcome during treatment of HCC [5–7]. Development
of molecularly targeted agents with novel mechanisms
of action is desperately essential to tackle the unmet
medical need. However, the success rate of developing
new therapies for HCC is low despite exceptional
investment in pharmaceutical research and development.
Lack of clinically relevant and molecularly characterized
preclinical models critically accounts for the failures in
the development of efficacious therapeutics for HCC [8].
Establishing patient-derived xenograft (PDX) tumor
models in immunodeficient mice has recently generated
excitement [9]. PDX models closely resemble the original
tumors in the aspects of histopathology, gene-expression
patterns, mutational status, and drug responsiveness [9].
In contrast with cancer types prevalent in the Western
countries, significantly fewer PDX models for HCC have
been developed up to date. The first report of the PDX
model for HCC appeared in 1996, in which a metastatic
model of HCC from a Chinese patient was established
orthotopically in athymic mice [10]. In 2004, also from a
Chinese patient, another PDX model was established and
reported [11]. In the same year, a group of researchers
in Spain reported five HCC PDX models [12]. In 2006,
seven subcutaneous PDX models were established from
Singapore HCC patients [13]. Obviously, the number
of articles that reported PDX models and/or apply PDX
models for sequential studies has been increasing gradually.
However, these earlier models had not been extensively
characterized at the molecular levels, which limited
their applications in development of targeted therapy.
Furthermore, etiology of HCC appears to be geographically
different due to the prevalence of different risk factors. Half
of the total HCC-related deaths and new cases occurred
in China, which is correlated with a high infection rate of
hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus [3]. Thus, a
molecularly understanding of an extensive panel of PDX
HCC models derived from Chinese patients is essential for
developing more effective therapy.
In this study, we set out to establish a collection of
PDX models from Chinese patients. Xenotransplantable
grafts were then extensively characterized at
histopathological, molecular, and pharmacological levels.
We found that PDX tumors retained the histopathological
and genomic features of their original counterparts. The
landscape of genetic alterations is in agreement with the
published data. Differential responses to sorafenib in
PDX models reflect the pharmacological heterogeneity
observed in the patient population. Efficacy of a novel
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

FGFR1-targeted therapy was further demonstrated in
multiple models expressing high levels of FGFR1 gene.
Collectively, molecularly characterized HCC PDX models
enable ‘personalized trials’ in mice by selecting potential
responders and assist in identification of predictive
biomarkers for patient stratification. Such an extensive
collection of PDX models will accelerate new target
discovery, test of novel therapeutics, and translation of
experimental therapies into the clinic.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
PDX establishment
In compliance with the protocol approved by the
Institutional Review Board of Eastern Hepatobiliary
Surgery Hospital/Institute of Shanghai and with the
subject’s informed consent, a fragment of surgically
resected tumor tissue was used for xenotransplantation [14].
Briefly, patient samples (designated as PA) were collected,
trimmed, cut into 20–30 mm3 fragments and implanted
subcutaneously in the fore and/or hind bilateral flanks of
anesthetized 6- to 8-week old female BALB/c athymic
or severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) mice
(Shanghai SLAC Laboratory Animal Co., Ltd.; Shanghai
Sino-British Sippr/BK Lab Animal Co., Ltd., Shanghai)
within three hours. The mice were examined periodically
for three months. Once the first generation of xenografts
(named as P0) was established, serial implantations in
BALB/c athymic mice were performed to expand the
xenograft tumors (i.e. P1, P2, P3, and beyond; Figure 1A).
Tumor size was measured using a digital caliper (Cal
Pro, Sylvac, Switzerland). Tumor volume was calculated
as 0.5 × length × width2. Tumor fragments (~200 mm3)
at each passage were viably frozen in a freezing solution
(10% DMSO, 20% FBS, and 70% RPMI 1640 medium)
and stored in liquid nitrogen for future re-implantation.
Additional fragments were either snap-frozen in liquid
nitrogen, or preserved in RNAlater RNA stabilization
reagent (Qiagen), or fixed for histology. All procedures and
protocols were approved by the Institutional Animal Care
and Use Committee of WuXi AppTec.

Histology
Patient samples and PDX tissues were formalinfixed, paraffin-embedded, cut into sections, and stained
with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E). Histopathology was
examined under light microscopy by a pathologist (XX).

Tissue processing for genomic studies
Genomic DNA and RNA were isolated using a
QIAamp DNA mini kit (Qiagen) and RNeasy protect
mini kit (Qiagen), respectively. The concentrations were
quantified using NanoDrop ND-1000 spectrophotometer

(NanoDrop, Wilmington, DE). RNA samples with an RNA
integrity number above 8.0 and A260/280 ratios above 2.0 were
used for gene expression array. DNA samples with A260/280
ratios between 1.8 and 2.0 and A260/230 ratios above 2.0, and
proven to be high quality by gel electrophoresis were used
for WES and SNP 6.0 array analyses.

proprietary algorithm to retrieve HUGO gene symbols of
genes that are located within the segments regions, with
copy number status and gene annotations.

Serum AFP expression
Sera were collected from mice bearing tumors with a
total volume of between 300 and 1,000 mm3. Fifteen μl of
sera was subjected to AFP detection by using an AimPlex
multiplex AFP assay kit following the manufacturer’s
instruction (QuantoBio, Beijing, China). Briefly, AFP
specific antibody coated bead suspension was added to
a 96-well filter plate. Test sera (15 μl) were added and
incubated. Extensive washing was performed afterwards
and between each step below. Biotinylated AFP specific
antibody (25 μl) was added and incubated. StreptavidinPE solution (25 μl) was added and incubated. Reading
buffer (150 μl) was added to resuspend the beads, and the
suspension was subject to flow cytometry analysis using a
Canto II (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA).

Gene expression array
Total RNA was amplified and fragmented using a
GeneChip® 3′ IVT expression kit (Affymetrix, Santa
Clara, CA). Then the samples were hybridized onto a
GeneChip® PrimeView™ human gene expression array
(Affymetrix). Arrays were scanned on an Affymetrix
GeneChip® scanner 3000 7G (Affymetrix). Resulting
data was subject to bioinformatics analysis. Briefly, the
raw CEL data were processed on an Expression Console™
(version 1.1, Affymetrix). Signal intensities were
normalized by the robust multiarray average normalization
approach. On 9 pairs of samples which consisted of
original patient samples and their corresponding xenograft
tumors, unsupervised hierarchical clustering analysis was
performed by ‘hclust’ package on R with criteria Euclidian
distance and average linkage.

Compounds and therapeutic assays
Sorafenib (LC Laboratories, Woburn, MA) was
formulated in CremophorEL/95% ethanol (50:50; Sigma)
at 4 × concentration and was diluted with distilled water.
Lenvatinib was synthesized by Wuxi AppTec (Shanghai,
China) with a purity of 96% and formulated in distilled
water. For efficacy studies, female BALB/c athymic mice
were implanted with tumor fragments subcutaneously.
When the tumors reached 150  –  200  mm3, the mice
were stratified into different groups for treatments. Each
group contained 5 animals. Sorafenib (60 mg/kg), or
lenvatinib (30 mg/kg), or vehicles were administered by
oral gavage daily. Tumor sizes and body weights were
measured twice weekly. Tumor growth inhibition (TGI)
is calculated for each group using the formula: TGI (%) =
[1−(Ti−T0)/ (Vi−V0)] × 100; Ti is the average tumor
volume of a treatment group on a given day, T0 is the
average tumor volume of the treatment group on the first
day of treatment, Vi is the average tumor volume of the
vehicle control group on the same day with Ti, and V0
is the average tumor volume of the vehicle group on the
first day of treatment. The differences of tumor volumes
between groups were analyzed for significance using
t test for studies with two groups; or one-way ANOVA
followed by Tukey’s test for studies with more than two
groups.

Whole exome sequencing (WES)
One microgram of each DNA sample was used
for library construction using a TruSeq DNA sample
preparation kit (Illumina, San Diego, CA). Libraries were
pool (500 ng each) for exome capture and amplification
using the TruSeq Exome Enrichment kit (Illumina).
Sequencing was then performed with paired-end
2 x 100 base reads on the Illumina HiSeq 2000 platform
(Illumina). Raw FASTQ files were first processed by
a proprietary algorithm to filter out mouse sequence
contaminations. We have shown that this filter step does
not affect the human SNP detection [15, 16]. After mouse
sequence removed, data was aligned to human reference
genome hg19/GRCh37 by BWA 0.6.1 and processed to
variants calling by GATK 1.6.

Copy number analysis
Genomic DNA was amplified and fragmented using
a core SNP 6 reagent kit and DNase I (Affymetrix). Then
the sample is hybridized onto Affymetrix GeneChip®
genome-wide human SNP array 6.0 arrays and the
arrays were scanned on an Affymetrix GeneChip®
scanner 3000 7G. Data was initially analyzed on the
Affymetrix Genotyping Console™ and subject to further
in-house analysis. Raw CEL data of SNP 6.0 arrays was
processed on the Genotyping Console (version 4.1.1.834,
Affymetrix). Segment summary of each sample was
generated by the Genotyping Console with default
configuration. Then all summaries were processed by a

were able to establish 65 xenograft tumors grown in

immunodeficient mice as transplantable PDX models
(~26%). PDXs were serially passaged in animals
3  –  5  times. The latencies of engraftment and growth
rates of PDXs varied significantly among different
models (Supplemental Figure 1). A bio-specimen
bank of original patient tissues and xenografts at each
passages was established, including formalin fixed
paraffin-embedded (FFPE) blocks, viably cryopreserved,
and RNAlater®-treated and/or snap frozen tissues
(Figure  1A). Cryopreserved xenografts could re-grow
in mice, providing a renewable tissue source for future
experimentations.
Clinical characteristics of these 65 original tumors,
including HBV viral infection history of patients tested
in the clinic, were summarized in Table 1. Among the
collection, ages of patients ranged from 26 up to 78 with
medium of 52. Tumor grades ranged from II to IV, and
tumor stages from I to IV. All of models were established
from treatment-naïve tumors.

Gene expression profiling was further performed in
xenografts of additional 34 models. All expression data
from 9 patient tumors and 43 PDXs have been deposited
to Gene Expression Omnibus (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.
gov/geo/; accession GSE55828). Thus, the global gene
expression signature in 43 models has been established,
which provides a database for searching for PDX models
exhibiting an appropriate biomarker for targeted therapy.
Notably, overexpression of FGFR1 gene was observed
in several models, which may discriminate a population
sensitive to FGFR1-targeted agents (Figure 2B). Three
models, designated as LI-03-0010, LI-03-0020 and
LI-03-0164, which overexpressed FGFR1 but not FGFR2
or FGFR3 genes in comparison with the average levels
of the collection of models, were selected for subsequent
in vivo pharmacological studies.

WES
WES was performed to detect mutational alterations,
including SNPs and indels, in protein-coding regions in 56
xenograft tumors at a coverage of 100 × . Xenografts at
P2 or P3 from 51 models were used with a few exceptions
(Table 1).
We first found that mouse DNA sequences
accounted for a significant fraction of sequence reads in
xenograft samples, even using a human exome capture
kit. In order to remove murine DNA sequences from
the xenograft sequencing data, we have established
a proprietary algorithm to deplete mouse sequence
contamination and keep human sequence reads intact.
The performance of this algorithm has been demonstrated
in a previous study of exome sequencing of eight casematched trio sets of Chinese esophageal squamous cell
carcinoma, blood, and PDX tumor tissues [15, 16]. An
example was elucidated in Supplemental Figure 2A. In
average, murine DNA reads contributed to approximately
40% of genetic variations detected in PDX tissues.
Excluding these contaminating mouse sequences
significantly improved the accuracy of mutation detection
in xenograft samples.
Across all 56 PDX models, we detected an average
of 8033.5 protein-altering single nucleotide alterations
(SNA) per model, including 86 frame-shift indels, 3.5 stopgain/loss indels, 7878 non-synonymous SNPs, and 66 stopgain/loss SNPs. A complete list of genetic alterations in 56
models was provided in Supplemental Table 2.
A variety of genetic alterations causing amino-acid
changes (i.e., non-synonymous alterations, including SNPs
and indels) on the genes have previously been linked to
HCC [17–19]. In our study, we identified many of them
in the 56 models (Supplemental Table 2). Regarding
TP53, genetic alterations were found in 42 models
(75%), including a variety of SNPs and 2 deletions.
Twelve models carried 13 genetic alterations in MLL3
gene, including 7 frame shift insertions and 6 SNPs

Histology of xenografts
The histology and degree of differentiation of
the PDX matched well with that of the original tumor
(Figure 1B). In addition, PDX tumors maintained intratumor
heterogeneity, resembling the original tumors (Figure 1B).

Molecular characterization of xenografts and/or
corresponding patients’ tumors
We then determined gene expression profiles,
mutational status, CNAs, and serum AFP expression in
PDX models by expression array, WES, SNP 6.0 array,
and flow cytometry, respectively.

Gene expression
In order to establish a correlation of gene expression
profiles between the original and xenograft tumors, we
first performed a pilot study in randomly selected nine
models indicated in Figure 2A. Each model comprised of
the original patient tumors and corresponding xenograft
tumors (P3). Unsupervised clustering of the results
showed that all of nice PDXs clustered tightly together
with the corresponding patient tumors, demonstrating that
PDXs authentically maintained the global gene expression
characteristics of patients’ tumors (Figure 2A).
To further identify the set of genes which
discriminated the PDXs from the original tumors, we
analyzed the differentially expressed genes between two
populations. The results showed that, compared to the
original tumors, 83 probe sets revealed the upregulation
of approximately 72 genes in xenografts with an average
fold change of 3.5, whereas 749 probe sets detected the
downregulation of approximately 744 genes in PDX
tumors (Supplemental Table 1).

(21%). For CTNNB1, we found SNPs in 8 models (14%).
Seven models showed SNPs in AXIN1 gene and another
exhibited deletion (14%). Five models showed distinct
SNPs in ARID1B gene (9%). Four models carried SNP,
or deletion, or insertion of RB1 gene (7%). Four models
carried distinct SNPs of JAK1 gene (7%). Three exhibited
SNPs of TP73 gene (5%). Two models carried a SNP and a
deletion, respectively, in CDKN2A gene (4%). One model
carried a SNP in KRAS gene (2%). One model carried a
SNP in IGF2R (2%).

We performed genome-wide human SNP 6.0 arrays to
determine DNA CNA across the entire human genome in 42
PDX tumors. The results were summarised in Supplemental
Table 3. Genes exhibited normal copy numbers (i.e., 2) were
left blank. Otherwise, 3 or 4, or higher numbers indicated
a copy number gain and 0 or 1 indicated a copy number
loss. A comparison of CNA with published data [20] was
illustrated in Table 2. For example, copy number losses

Figure 3: The effect of standard-of-care compound sorafenib was evaluated in two HCC models (LI-03-0018 at P6;
LI-03-0012 at P5). Tumor-bearing animals were treated for 22 and 21 days in LI-03-0018 and LI-03-0012 models, respectively. Tumor

volumes (left panel) and body weight changes (right panel) were plotted by the mean ± standard error mean. At the end point, compared
to vehicle controls, tumor growth inhibition induced by the treatment with sorafenib was statistically significant with variable confidence
P levels: P < 0.05 and P < 0.01 in LI-03-0018 and LI-03-0012 models, respectively. No statistical difference in the changes of body weights
was identified between vehicle and treatment groups in both experiments (P > 0.05).

of AFF1 (76%), RAP1GDS1 (71%), TP53 (64%), PTEN
(19%) genes were identified. Copy number gains were
detected in PBX1 (76%), PRCC (76%), ARNT (62%),
MYC (62%), BCL9 (60%), MTDH (52%), MET (43%), and
FGF19 (14%).

In order to elucidate the application of the
molecularly characterized PDX models in personalized
medicine, we selected three models LI-03-0010,
LI-03-0020 and LI-03-0164 with overexpression of
FGFR1 gene, but with lower-than-average levels of
FGFR2/3 genes (Figure 2B), for targeted therapy of
FGFR inhibitor lenvatinib. Our results showed that
FGFR1-overexpressing models were more sensitive
to the treatment with lenvatinib in comparison with
sorafenib (Figure 4). TGIs of lenvatinib and sorafenib
were 101% and 91%, respectively, in the model of
LI-03-0010; 99% and 60% in LI-03-0020; and 73% and
56% in LI-03-0164. Although no statistically significant
growth inhibition was observed between lenvatinib and
sorafenib treatment groups, a greater effect of lenvatinib was
clearly demonstrated, especially in the model of LI-03-0020,
in which statistically significant tumor growth inhibition
was only induced by the treatment with lenvanitib, but not
with sorafenib, in comparison with vehicle control.
In all three in vivo experiments, body weights
of lenvatinib-treated mice were maintained better than
sorafenib-treated mice (Figure 4). A profound weight loss
(i.e., ≥ 20%) only appeared in sorafenib-treated group
in LI-03-0164, which led to treatment discontinuation
since  d8. These results implicate for less toxicity of
lenvatinib compared to sorafenib.

Detection of AFP in serum in PDX models
Among 32 models tested, serum AFP was detectable
in 26 models (81.3%; Table 1), suggesting that a large
fraction of PDX models reflect the characteristics of HCC
in clinic.

Differential responses to sorafenib and efficacy
of FGFR inhibitor lenvatinib
To evaluate the responses of PDX models to the
standard-of-care agent, we first conducted in vivo efficacy
studies of sorafenib in two randomly selected PDX
models (Figure 3). Interestingly, one model, designated
as LI-03-0018, showed a partial response (TGI, 58%)
whereas another LI-03-0012 showed a stable disease
(TGI, 96%). These results suggest that, similar to the
heterogeneous patient population in clinic, PDX models
responded to the standard-of-care therapy differentially.

Figure 4: The effects of FGFR inhibitor lenvatinib and sorafenib were evaluated in FGFR1-overexpressing models
LI-0010 (P8), LI-0020 (P6), and LI-03-0164 (P5). In the study in LI-03-0010, tumor-bearing animals were treated for 21 days with

lenvatinib or sorafenib, whereas the vehicle group was terminated at day 11 due to its rapid growth. Statistical analyses were performed
using the data at d11. In comparison with the tumor sizes in the control group, significant tumor growth inhibition was observed in both
sorafenib- (P < 0.05) and lenvatinib-treated (P < 0.05) groups. No significant difference was observed between two agents (P > 0.05). Loss
of body weight was observed in both treatment groups when compared with the control group (P < 0.05) and, additionally, a significant
difference existed between two treatment groups (P < 0.05). In the study in LI-03-0020, all of tumor-bearing animals in there groups were
treated for 21 days. At the end point, significant growth inhibition was only observed in lenvatinib-treated group compared to the control
group (P < 0.05). however, a significant loss of body weight only appeared in sorafenib-treated group compared to the control group
(P < 0.05). In the study in LI-03-0164, tumor-bearing animals were treated for 22 days. No significant difference in tumor growth inhibition
or body weight was observed in this study (P > 0.05).

DISCUSSION

to P9 [21]. In the present study, we characterized gene
expression profiles of xenografts collected at P3, at which
passage the tumor materials usually become sufficient to
perform robust efficacy studies. The results demonstrate
that xenografts accurately reflect the global expression
profiles of the original tumors with limited changes. In
agreement with earlier studies of colorectal cancer [21],
among the genes down-regulated in xenografts with
respect to patient tumors, we observed enrichment in
genes encoding for extracellular matrix components,
cell adhesion molecules, and immune system regulators
(Supplemental Table 1). The data suggest that modification

In this study, we have established a large collection
of serially transplantable PDX models for HCC. The
collection of PDX models recapitulates the features of the
original tumors, including histopathology, gene expression
profiles, mutational status, DNA CNA, and a serum
biomarker, making it an excellent tool for study of HCC
and drug discovery.
An earlier study showed that the differences of
gene expression between xenografts and original patient
samples were relatively low through the passages up

role of PDE4DIP in HCC tumorigenesis requires further
investigation. Moreover, alterations of SARM1 gene were
frequently observed in PDX models with 111 SNPs and
1 deletion in 55 models (98%). SARM1 is a negative
regulator of MYD88- and TRIF-dependent toll-like
receptor signalling pathway involved in innate immune
response. Genetic alterations of this gene were frequently
observed in esophageal adenocarcinoma [29], colon and
rectal cancer [30], and lung adenocarcinoma [31]. These
novel alterations identified in PDX models warrant further
studies to explore their biological functions in HCC
tumorigenesis. Overall, the spectrum of protein-altering
genetic variations in our PDX collection is similar to that
reported in the literature for HCC. PDX tumor grafts retain
the molecular features of original tumors.
The genomic landscape of HCC, especially CNA,
has been extensively characterized in 286 paired tumor
and adjacent non-tumor tissues [20]. This work led to
identification of 29 amplification peaks and 22 deletion
peaks with high confidence [20]. Notably, our overall
CNA pattern is consistent with the earlier study (Table 2),
indicating that the PDX models recapitulate the genetic
CNA landscape of HCC clinical samples. For instance,
the oncogenic role of BCL9 and MTDH genes has been
established in the recent study [20]. BCL9 encodes B-cell
CLL/lymphoma 9, which is involved in the WNT/βcatenin signaling pathway by mediating the recruitment
of pypopus to the nuclear β-catenin-TCF complex [32].
An oncogenic role of MTDH gene, which encodes
metadherin, has been implicated in a variety of cancer
types including HCC [33]. Gene expression and protein
expression (assessed by immunohistochemistry) of BCL9
and MTDH correlated with their somatic copy numbers
[20]. Inhibition of BCL9 and MTDH expression mediated
by siRNA significantly suppressed cell proliferation of
HCC cell lines with BCL9 and MTDH gene amplifications,
respectively, but not in copy number neutral cell lines
[20]. Consistent to the earlier report, the copy number
gains of both genes were identified in 60% and 52% of
PDX models, respectively, in our study. The frequencies
of amplification of both genes ranked on the top of the
gene lists identified in PDX models (Table 2), which is
in agreement with that both BCL9 and MTDH genes may
play an important role in HCC development. In addition,
the potential oncogenic role of PRDM14 and FRWD2
genes has been implicated in earlier report [20]. We also
found that amplifications of PRDM14 and RFWD2 gene in
41% and 57%, respectively, of PDX models (Supplemental
Table 3). Our results support that both genes are worthy
the further investigation as oncogenic drivers of HCC.
AFP has been considered a biomarker for prognosis
and treatment outcome [5–7]. In this study, similar to
clinical patients, a large fraction of HCC models exhibited
the elevated levels of serum AFP, demonstrating that PDX
models may serve as an in vivo system for evaluating
serum AFP in the preclinical setting.

of gene expression in xenografts is attributable to the loss
of the human stromal components and the infiltration of
mouse stromal cells. Conversely, genes associated with
cell cycle and DNA replication were up-regulated in PDX
tissues, suggesting that the enrichment of the tumorigenic
cell population. Overall, despite of the limited differences
caused by the distinct tumor microenvironment, PDX
tissues authentically retain the gene expression patterns of
the original tumors.
It is noteworthy that enhancer of zeste homolog
2 (EZH2) is one of 72 genes upregulated in xenografts.
EZH2 plays an important role in HCC tumorigenesis [22]
and its up-regulation was associated with HCC progression
and metastasis [23, 24]. Moreover, EZH2 regulates the
self-renewal and differentiation of murine hepatic stem/
progenitor cells [25] and tumor-initiating HCC cells
are highly dependent on EZH2 for their tumorigenic
activity [26]. It has been shown that EZH2 concordantly
silences the Wnt pathway antagonists operating at
several subcellular compartments, which in turn activate
Wnt/β-catenin signaling in HCC, and concomitant
overexpression of EZH2 and β-catenin was observed in
one-third of HCC cases and significantly correlated with
tumor progression [23]. Furthermore, Short-hairpin RNA
and pharmacological inhibition of EZH2 impaired HCC
cell growth and anchorage-independent sphere formation
of HCC cells in culture [26]. Knockdown of EZH2 in
HCC cell lines suppressed HCC motility in vitro and
pulmonary metastasis in an athymic mouse model [24].
Collectively, considering of the enrichment of tumorigenic
cancer cells at xenotransplanation, our findings agree
that pharmacological interference with EZH2 might be a
promising therapeutic approach to targeting HCC.
Mutations in various genes have been reported
in primary HCC specimen, including TP53, CTNNB1,
AXIN1, RB1, TP73, CDKN2A, KRAS and IGF2R [17–19].
In agreement with the literature, WES analyses revealed
that these genes were frequently mutated in 56  PDX
models with an incidence of 75%, 14%, 14%, 7%, 5%,
4%, 2%, and 2%, respectively. Therefore, our data
obtained from PDX models confirm the potential linkage
of these genes with HCC development and progression.
In addition to identifying known mutations
in HCC, a number of novel SNPs and indels were
uncovered through WES of PDX samples. Most notably,
phosphodiesterase 4D interacting protein (PDE4DIP)
gene ranks on the top of genetic alterations (i.e., SNPs
and indels; Supplemental Table 2), showing 190
genetic alterations in all of 56 models tested (100%).
These alterations include 1 insertion, 19 deletions, and
170 SNPs. The protein encoded by PDE4DIP serves to
anchor phosphodiesterase 4D to the Golgi/centrosome
region of the cell. PDE4DIP was reported to fuse to
PDGRFB gene in myeloproliferative disorders [27]. The
expression of serum PDE4DIP protein was linked to
esophageal squamous cell carcinoma [28]. The potential

The promise of PDX models is to accelerate the
development of novel therapeutics. PDXs derived from
HCC patient samples have been utilized for in vivo
pharmacological tests of of several drugs, including
anti-VEGF antibody bevaciumab [34], mTOR inhibitors
sirolimus [35] and everolimus [36], dual inhibitor of
VEGFR and FGFR brivanib [37], sorafenib [35, 38, 39],
EGFR inhibitor gefitinib [13], MEK1/2 inhibitor AZD6244
[39, 40], VEGFR and PDGFR inhibitor sunitinib [38, 41],
VEGFR-2 and C-MET inhibitor foretinib [42], FGFR,
VEGFR and PDGFR inhibitor dovitinib [43]. In the present
study, we first showed the differential responses to the
treatment with sorafenib in two randomly selected models,
indicating that the panel of models represents the distinct
outcomes of a diverse HCC patient population in clinic.
Developing potential predictive markers to identify
the responders in the patient population is the key for the
success of clinical development. Molecular characterized
PDX models are an excellent in vivo system to explore
predicative biomarkers for various targeted agents.
As  an example, in FGFR1-overexpressing models,
LI-03-0010, LI-03-0020, and LI-03-0164, we
demonstrated that lenvatinib exhibited antitumor activity
greater than sorafenib. Additionally, the treatment with
lenvatinib appeared to be better tolerated in animals when
compared with sorafenib because the first agent never
caused dosing suspension while the latter did that in the
model of LI-03-0164. In the tested models, the elevated
levels of FGFR1 gene, but not FGFR2 or FGFR3 genes,
were detected by expression assays regarding to their basal
levels in a panel of PDX models (Figure 2B), suggesting
that FGFR1 expression levels may be further investigated
as a predictive biomarker for the therapy of lenvatinib.
Lenvatinib was very recently approved by US
FDA for the treatment of patients with locally recurrent
or metastics, progressive, radioactive iodine-refreactory
differentiated thyroid cancer [44]. Lenvatinib is a nonselective tyrosine kinase inhibitor [45]. It selectively targets
FGFR1 among FGFR1-4. However, as a multikinase
inhibitor, lenvatinib also inhibits VEGFR1-3, PDGFR-α
and PDGFR-β [45]. Different from sorafenib, it was
speculated that the effects of lenvatinib on thyroid cancer
could be mediated by the inhibition of unique targets of
lenvantinib, including FGFR1 [44]. Further studies are
warranted to elucidate the mechanism of action for tumor
growth inhibition in FGFR1-overexpressing HCC PDX
models, and to confirm the genomic correlation of the drug
sensitivity with overexpression of FGFR1 gene. Clearly,
our results demonstrated that such a sub-population of
HCC patients may respond to the treatment with lenvatinib
better than sorafenib. Overall, our data provide evidence
that FGF/FGFR pathway is a therapeutic target for the
treatment of a subpopulation of HCC patients. Especially,
as lenvatinib is recently approved by FDA for the
treatment of patients with thyroid cancer, a rapid clinical
development of the drug in HCC may become feasible.

In conclusion, we have developed an extensive
panel of PDX models for HCC, which authentically
maintain the histopathological and molecular
characteristics of the original tumors. Such a panel
of molecularly characterized animal models for HCC
provides an excellent opportunity to study the biology of
HCC, to develop novel therapy, as well as to facilitate
research of personalized medicine.
