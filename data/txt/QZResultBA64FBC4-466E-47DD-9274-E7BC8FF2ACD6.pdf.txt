BACKGROUND: There is limited information about the risk factors for ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence (IBTR) after patients
undergo breast-conserving surgery plus radiotherapy (breast-conserving treatment [BCT]) subsequent to neoadjuvant chemotherapy
(NAC). The objective of the current study was to analyze these risk factors. METHODS: The authors collected data from 375 patients
who underwent BCT and received NAC and analyzed the risk of IBTR associated with undergoing BCT after NAC. The usefulness of
the MD Anderson Prognostic Index (MDAPI) for IBTR also was validated using the current data set. RESULTS: The median follow-up
was 47.8 months, and the 4-year IBTR-free survival rate was 95.6%. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that estrogen receptor (ER)
status and multifocality of the residual tumor were associated significantly with IBTR-free survival. In addition, patients who had ERpositive and human epidermal growth factor 2 (HER2)-negative tumors did not develop IBTR during the observation period.
Although prognostic stratification according to MDAPI was relatively good for the prediction of IBTR in the study patients, the IBTR
rate in the high-risk group was not very high and was lower than that in the intermediate-risk group. Multivariate analyses demonstrated that IBTR was an independent predictive factor for overall survival. CONCLUSIONS: ER status and multifocality of the residual
tumor after NAC were independent predictors of IBTR after BCT. The MDAPI was barely adaptable to the study patients in terms of
predicting IBTR. Patients with ER-positive and HER2-negative tumors had a favorable prognosis, whereas patients who developed
IBTR after NAC had significantly worse overall survival. The authors propose a new IBTR prognostic index using the 2 factors that

INTRODUCTION
Breast-conserving surgery and radiotherapy (breast-conserving treatment [BCT]) is now accepted as a locoregional treatment alternative to mastectomy for women with early stage breast cancer.1,2 For patients with larger tumors, neoadjuvant
chemotherapy (NAC) is administered increasingly with the expectation of BCT. A major benefit of NAC is that it
increases the proportion of patients who can undergo BCT.3-5 However, several authors have reported high local recurrence rates among patients who underwent BCT after NAC.3,5,6
It has long been believed that local recurrence has little effect on overall survival. In 2005, however, the Early Breast
Cancer Trialists’ Collaborative Group reported results from a meta-analysis of data from randomized controlled trials of
breast-conserving surgery with or without breast radiotherapy.7 That analysis demonstrated that the use of radiation therapy decreased not only the rates of local recurrence but also the 15-year risk of dying, which generated a reappraisal of the
importance of local control. Therefore, we believed it would be useful to accurately evaluate the risks of local recurrences.
The risk factors for developing ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence (IBTR) for patients who undergo BCT are well
known. These include tumor size, lymph node status, histologic subtype, surgical margin status, and lymphovascular

invasion and are used routinely in decisions regarding the
locoregional management of breast cancer. However, few
data are available concerning the risk factors of IBTR for
patients who undergo BCT after receiving NAC.8-13
With regard to IBTR after NAC, in 2001, Rouzier
et al reported their experience at Institute Curie.8 In their
study, multivariate analysis demonstrated that the probability of local control was decreased by the following independent factors: age <40 years, excision margin <2 mm,
S-phase fraction >4%, and clinical tumor size >2 cm at
the time of surgery.
Chen et al identified clinicopathologic factors that
would predict local recurrence after NAC followed by
BCT and developed a prognostic index: the MD Anderson Prognostic Index (MDAPI).9,14 Those authors
reported that the MDAPI enabled the identification of
patients who had a high risk of developing IBTR and
locoregional recurrences when they underwent breastconserving surgery after receiving NAC. The MDAPI was
cited in published guidelines as a tool for the selection of
patients with a high probability of developing local recurrence.15,16 However, few reports have presented a validation study of the MDAPI, especially multi-institutional
studies.17
It is now widely recognized that patients with IBTR
have a worse prognosis than those without IBTR,18-21 but
limited information is available about the prognosis for
patients who undergo IBTR after receiving NAC. For the
current study, we investigated the risk factors for IBTR after NAC and validated the MDAPI using data from a
multi-institutional series. We also evaluated the impact of
IBTR after NAC on overall survival.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
In total, 375 consecutive breast cancer patients with newly
diagnosed, noninflammatory tumors measuring 2 cm
who had no metastases and who underwent breast-conserving surgery after NAC between 1995 and 2009 were
included in this analysis from 8 institutions in Japan. This
retrospective study was approved by each institutional
review board.
Inclusion criteria were: 1) patients with solitary tumor measuring 2 cm; 2) patients who received at least 3
courses of NAC; 3) patients who underwent breast-conserving surgery, axillary surgery (sentinel lymph node biopsy only was allowed if these lymph nodes had no
metastases), and radiotherapy to the affected breast.
Exclusion criteria were: 1) patients who underwent mastectomy; 2) patients with synchronous (defined as occurring within 3 months) bilateral breast cancer; 3) patients
4386

who underwent/received prior breast surgery, hormone
therapy, chemotherapy, or radiation therapy; 4) patients
who received trastuzumab before breast surgery, or 5)
patients who underwent excisional biopsy. The eligibility
for BCT after NAC depended on the physician’s decision
at each institution as well as patient preference.
All patients received adjuvant external-beam radiation therapy to the affected breast. The median radiation
dose to the breast was 50 grays (Gy) (range, 40-51 Gy).
The tumor bed was boosted with external radiotherapy in
112 patients (29.9%; median dose, 10 Gy; range, 9-20
Gy). In addition, radiation to the supraclavicular fossa
was received by 13 patients (3.5%).
Questionnaire forms were sent to the members of
this study in October 2009 to collect clinicopathologic
patient data. The questionnaire requested the following
data: age at diagnosis, date of birth, age at definitive surgery, date of definitive surgery, initial tumor size on palpation, clinical lymph node status, type of NAC regimen,
number of NAC courses, clinical tumor size at surgery,
pathologic lymph node status, residual invasive tumor
size, residual tumor multifocality, chemotherapeutic
effect, histologic margin status, lymphovascular invasion,
histologic grade, estrogen receptor (ER) and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) status before and
after NAC, postoperative endocrine therapy, postoperative chemotherapy, postoperative trastuzumab, dose of
postoperative irradiation, boost radiation, IBTR and its
date of detection, death, and date of death or last visit.
The initial clinical stage and pathologic stage of disease in
all patients were revised and based on the seventh edition
of the American Joint Committee on Cancer staging criteria.22 Histologic type and grade were defined according to
the World Health Organization classification system.23
Information on ER or HER2 status obtained from surgical specimens was used for analyses. However, when there
was insufficient material to evaluate ER or HER2 status in
the surgical specimens, ER or HER2 status was based
instead on core-needle samples obtained before NAC. A
pathologic complete response (pCR) was defined as no
involvement of invasive or noninvasive cancer in the
breast tumor.
IBTR was defined as all events that occurred in the
remaining breast after BCT. IBTRs were counted as
events regardless of whether they occurred at the initial
sites of failure or concurrent with or after distant metastasis. IBTR-free survival and overall survival were calculated
using the Kaplan-Meier method. Log-rank tests or chisquare tests were used to evaluate differences in IBTR-free
survival and overall survival among various patient

subgroups. Multivariate analyses for IBTR-free survival
and overall survival were performed using a Cox proportional hazards model.
We also evaluated the usefulness of the MDAPI14 in
our patient cohort. In the MDAPI, 4 clinicopathologic
factors were selected to predict IBTR in patients who
received NAC followed by BCT. These factors were initial
clinical lymph node status (N0-N1 vs N2-N3), pathologic tumor size (2 cm of invasive disease vs >2 cm),
pattern of tumor morphology after pathologic analysis
(solitary vs multifocal residual disease), and lymphovascular space invasion in the tumor specimen (present vs
absent). The MDAPI was derived by assigning a score of 0
(favorable) or 1 (unfavorable) based on the presence or absence of each of these factors. The MDAPI score (0, 1, 2,
3, or 4) for each patient was determined by totaling the
scores of these 4 individual variables. Finally, the scores
were grouped into 3 subsets: a low-risk group (MDAPI
score, 0 or 1), an intermediate-risk group (MDAPI score,
2), and a high-risk group (MDAPI score, 3 or 4).
Based on the data from our multivariate analyses, we
built a new prognostic index. In this index, scores for ER
status (0, ER positive; 1, ER negative) and residual tumor
morphology (0, none or solitary; 1, multifocal) were
added, and total scores of 0/1 and 2 were used to classify
patients into a low IBTR risk group and a high IBTR risk
group, respectively.
All statistical tests and P values were 2-sided, and P
values < .05 were considered significant. All statistical
analyses were performed with StatView 5.0 software (SAS
Institute, Cary, NC).
RESULTS
In total, 375 patients were registered in this analysis.
Patient and pathologic characteristics are provided in
Tables 1 and 2, respectively. The median age at diagnosis
was 48 years (range, 18-76 years). The median clinical tumor size at diagnosis was 40 mm (range, 20-130 mm).
For NAC, 89 patients received an anthracycline-containing regimen, 31 patients received a taxane-containing regimen, and 255 patients received both anthracyclinecontaining and taxane-containing regimens. The median
number of NAC courses actually administered was 4
(range, 3-8 NAC courses). There were no significant differences between participating institutions with regard to
distribution of the characteristics listed in Tables 1 and 2
(data not shown).
The median follow-up after definitive surgery was
47.8 months (range, 4-137 months). The 4-year overall
survival rate was 91.8%, and the IBTR-free survival rate

overall survival rate or the IBTR-free survival rate (data
not shown). Various clinical and pathologic factors associated with IBTR-free survival are presented in Table 3. ER
status, residual multifocal lesions, and pathologic lymph
node status were associated significantly with IBTR-free
survival in log-rank tests. In addition, none of the patients
with ER-positive and HER2-negative tumors developed
IBTR during the study period, and the frequency of IBTR
for this subgroup was significantly less than that for
patients in the categories with other ER and HER2 status
(P ¼ .0121; chi-square test). Furthermore, none of 55
patients who achieved a pCR developed IBTR during the
study period, and 13 of 274 patients who failed to achieve
a pCR developed IBTR. The 4-year IBTR-free survival
rate for the patients who achieved a pCR (100%) was better than that for the patients who did not achieve a pCR
(95.7%), although the difference was not statistically significant (P ¼ .0993; chi-square test). Multivariate

analyses using ER status, multifocal lesions at surgery, and
pathologic lymph node status demonstrated that ER status and multifocal lesions at surgery were independent
predictive factors of IBTR-free survival (Table 4).
We also calculated the MDAPI in our patient cohort
and then grouped the patients into low-risk, intermediate-risk, and high-risk groups. Of 375 patients, all 4 clinicopathologic factors on the MDAPI were available for
252 patients. Of these, 171 patients (67.9%) were classified into the low-risk category, 52 patients (20.6%) were
classified into the intermediate-risk category, and 29
patients (11.5%) were classified into the high-risk category. It is noteworthy that no patient had an MDAPI
score of 4. Among the 3 groups, the IBTR-free survival
rate differed significantly (P ¼ .0092; log-rank test).
However, patients in the intermediate-risk group had paradoxically worse IBTR-free survival than those in the
high-risk group (4-year IBTR-free survival rate: low-risk
category, 98.1%; intermediate-risk category, 87.1; highrisk category, 93%). Furthermore, the IBTR-free survival
rate differed significantly between the low-risk group versus the intermediate-risk and high-risk groups. The 4-year
IBTR-free survival rate was 98.1% in the low-risk group
and 89.3% in the intermediate-risk and high-risk groups
(P ¼ .0087; log-rank test).
Because of the poor adaptability of the MDAPI to
our patients, we constructed a new IBTR prognostic index
using data on ER status and tumor morphology. The vast
majority of patients were categorized to the low-risk group
(267 patients), and only 33 patients were categorized into
the high-risk group. The 4-year IBTR-free survival rate
was 96.5% in the low-risk group and 87.4% in the highrisk group (P ¼ .0028; log-rank test) (Fig. 2).
Univariate analyses that included various clinical
and pathologic factors were performed to identify which
factors were predictive of overall survival. Pathologic
lymph node status (N0 vs others), histologic grade (grade
1 or 2 vs grade 3), pathologic tumor size (T0 or T1 vs
others), ER status (positive vs negative), and IBTR (absent
vs present) were associated significantly with overall survival. Multivariate analyses that included these 5 factors
identified IBTR as an independent predictive factor for
overall survival (hazard ratio, 2.732; 95% confidence
interval, 1.076-6.944; P ¼ .0344) (Table 5).

DISCUSSION
To our knowledge, the current study is the largest to date
investigating the risk factors for IBTR in patients with
breast cancer who undergo BCT after receiving NAC.
Several authors have reported factors that predict IBTR

after NAC.8-13 Among these, the MDAPI9,14 is well
known and is cited by published guidelines.15,16 The
MDAPI includes 4 factors (initial clinical lymph node status, pathologic tumor size, pattern of tumor morphology
after pathologic analysis, and lymphovascular space invasion). In our study, among these factors, only tumor multifocality was identified as an independent predictive
factor of IBTR after NAC. In other published reports, the
most frequently identified factors were classic morphologic factors, such as tumor size,8,9,12 lymph node status,9
stage,10,12,13 or margin status.8,10,11 These factors also are
recognized as risk factors for IBTR without NAC. Among
these factors, margin status was not associated with IBTRfree survival in our study. Margin status tended to be a significant predictive factor in studies in which patients had
a greater frequency of positive margin (range, 7%12.3%)8,10,11 than other reports (range, 0%-4%).9,12,13
The frequency of positive margins in our study was relatively high (10.5%), but margin status was not significant.
The reason for this finding remains unknown. Our results
regarding margin status may have differed from previous
reports partially because of difference in the definition of
positive margins. In our study, clinical lymph node status
was not associated with IBTR-free survival, but pathologic
lymph node status was correlated significantly with
IBTR-free survival. The reason of this discrepancy may be
the high frequency of inconsistency between clinical and
pathologic lymph node status.
In our study population, the MDAPI accurately
could predict IBTR-free survival only if we combined the
intermediate-risk and high-risk groups. There have been
few reports regarding validation of the MDAPI, except
from The MD Anderson Cancer Center itself.17
We constructed a new prognostic index using data on ER

status and tumor morphology. Our index separated
patients into a low-risk group, which had an acceptable 4year IBTR rate of 3.5%, and a high-risk group, which had
an unacceptably high IBTR rate of 12.6%. However, the
possibility could not be ruled out that the paradoxical
findings among the women who had an intermediate
MDAPI score resulted from the differences in several
baseline characteristics between our cohort and those in
other reports from the MD Anderson Cancer Center. For
example, the frequency of positive lymphovascular invasion in our study (36.5%) was higher than that in the
study from the MD Anderson Cancer Center (15%).9
Also, the frequency of clinical N2 or N3 lymph node status in our study (4.6%) was lower than that in the study
from the MD Anderson Cancer Center (23.2%).9 These
differences may have resulted in rendering lymphovascular invasion and clinical lymph node status nonsignificant
as predictive factors for IBTR in our study along with the
subsequent paradoxical findings mentioned above. Further validation studies of the MDAPI and our new prognostic index are needed.
Recently, there has been considerable evidence that
gene expression profile-based24,25 and immunohistochemistry-based26,27 subtypes are associated significantly
with distant metastases. More recently, several reports
have demonstrated that the subtypes also predict the risk
of local recurrence.28-31 In our study, none of the patients
with ER-positive and HER2-negative tumors developed
IBTR during follow-up. To our knowledge, there is no
report regarding the significance of an immunohistochemistry-based subgroup with IBTR after NAC. Several
groups have identified negative hormone receptor status
as the strongest predictive factor for a pCR.32-34 Results

that patients with ER-positive and HER2-negative
tumors had remarkably low pCR rates compared with
other subgroups. Despite low pCR rates among patients
with ER-positive and HER2-negative tumors, this subgroup has better disease-free and overall survival. This
may be because these are slowly proliferating tumors that
are more amenable to local treatment and because these
patients also benefit from a much longer course of endocrine treatment.15 The results of the current study are
comparable to these findings and demonstrate the safety
of BCT after NAC for patients with ER-positive and
HER2-negative tumors. Although this finding is very
promising, caution is needed, because approximately
25% of the samples in our study provided no information

about HER2 status. If all the missing data of HER2 are
positive or negative, then the difference in IBTR rates
between the ER-positive and HER2-negative subtype and
other subtypes remains statistically significant (P ¼ .0021
and P ¼ .0155, respectively; chi-square test). Further
studies are needed, including Ki-67 analyses.
In the current study, we demonstrated that IBTR after NAC was a strong predictor of overall survival. Several
studies have suggested that the development of IBTR after
BCT for patients with early-stage cancer predicts a poorer
prognosis.18-21 However, there has been limited information about IBTR after NAC. Rouzier et al8 reported that
patients who developed IBTR after NAC had significantly
worse distant metastases-free survival. To our knowledge,
there have not been any studies regarding the significance
of IBTR after NAC on overall survival.
One of the limitations in our study is the lack of uniform eligibility criteria for BCT after NAC among the
participating institutions. However, in our study, the 4year IBTR rate of 4.4% in patients who underwent BCT
after NAC was acceptably low. Several authors have
reported high local recurrence rates in patients who
underwent BCT after NAC.3,5,6 More recently, however,
a systematic review demonstrated that the increased local
recurrence rate associated with NAC is greatly reduced after excluding studies in which patients received radiotherapy alone after complete tumor regression.35 An annual
IBTR rate of approximately 1% in this study seems to
support the validity of each institution’s eligibility criteria
for BCT.
The second limitation is the relatively short followup (median, 47.8 months). The possibility could not be
ruled out that our findings that patients with ER-positive
tumors had better IBTR-free survival than those with ERnegative tumors merely reflected the different timing of
IBTR among the intrinsic subtypes. It is now well known
that triple-negative and HER2-positive disease is most
likely to recur within the first 3 years, whereas ER-positive
disease may recur many years later.

Original Article

The third limitation is the high frequency of missing
data, especially HER2 status (24.3%). This may have
affected our results, both with respect to the original
MDAPI score validation and ER/HER2.
In conclusion, ER status and multifocality of the residual tumor were identified as independent predictors of
IBTR after NAC. The MDAPI was barely adaptable to
our patients in terms of predicting IBTR. Patients with
ER-positive and HER2-negative tumors had a favorable
prognosis, whereas patients who developed IBTR after
NAC had significantly worse overall survival. If these
results are confirmed in further studies, then these data
will provide useful information for adequate decisionmaking in patients who plan to receive NAC with the expectation of BCT.
