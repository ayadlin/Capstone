Abstract
The BRAFV600E mutation is common in several human cancers, especially melanoma. RG7204 (PLX4032) is a
small-molecule inhibitor of BRAFV600E kinase activity that is in phase II and phase III clinical testing. Here, we
report a preclinical characterization of the antitumor activity of RG7204 using established in vitro and in vivo
models of malignant melanoma. RG7204 potently inhibited proliferation and mitogen-activated protein/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) kinase and ERK phosphorylation in a panel of tumor cell lines, including
melanoma cell lines expressing BRAFV600E or other mutant BRAF proteins altered at codon 600. In contrast,
RG7204 lacked activity in cell lines that express wild-type BRAF or non-V600 mutations. In several tumor
xenograft models of BRAFV600E-expressing melanoma, we found that RG7204 treatment caused partial or complete tumor regressions and improved animal survival, in a dose-dependent manner. There was no toxicity
observed in any dose group in any of the in vivo models tested. Our findings offer evidence of the potent
antitumor activity of RG7204 against melanomas harboring the mutant BRAFV600E gene. Cancer Res; 70(13);

Introduction
The Ras-Raf-MEK-ERK signaling pathway has been implicated in human oncogenesis (1–3). This pathway normally
connects extracellular signals, such as growth factors and
hormones, to the nucleus, leading to the expression of genes
that regulate cell proliferation, differentiation, and survival
(2). When a ligand binds to its receptor tyrosine kinase on
the plasma membrane, it stimulates the activity of Ras.
One major effector of Ras is the Raf family of serine/threonine kinases, which comprises A-Raf, BRAF, and C-Raf (4–7).
Raf proteins signal through phosphorylation and activation
of a downstream kinase, mitogen-activated protein (MAP)/
extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) kinase (MEK),
which subsequently phosphorylates and activates ERK (8).
The Ras-Raf-MEK-ERK pathway may be constitutively activated in human cancers through mutations in Ras or Raf
(1–3).

Mutations in BRAF have been found in ∼8% of human cancers, including ∼50% of melanomas, 30% to 70% of thyroid
cancers, 30% of serous low-grade ovarian cancers, and 10%
of colorectal cancers (2, 9). The majority of BRAF mutations
detected in human cancer cell lines and primary tumors are
substitutions of a single amino acid in the kinase domain
(V600E; ref. 9). The V600E mutation results in constitutively
active BRAF that is independent of activation by Ras (9).
Based on its association with human cancers, BRAF has
been a target of small-molecule therapies to treat cancer
(1, 3). Raf inhibitors, such as BAY 43-9006 (sorafenib), are
not selective for BRAF, with activity against multiple kinase
targets (10). Other small-molecule BRAF inhibitors include
RAF265 (11), XL281 (12), AZ628 (13), GSK2118436 (14), and
GDC-0879 (15).
RG7204 (formerly PLX4032) is a small-molecule inhibitor
that inhibits BRAFV600E with a IC50 of 30 nmol/L (data not
shown). It is undergoing phase II and III clinical investigation. In a previous preclinical study, RG7204 had an antiproliferative effect in melanoma and thyroid cell lines, with a
concomitant dose-dependent block of MEK1/2 phosphorylation (16). In addition, RG7204 induced apoptosis in a melanoma cell line (16).
A phase I dose-escalation study with RG7204 showed
promising results, particularly in patients with metastatic
melanoma (17, 18). Melanoma patients with the BRAFV600E
mutation were dosed with RG7204 formulated for increased
bioavailability. Eleven of 16 patients treated with >240 mg bid
had partial regression, and three others showed a lesser
response that did not reach the Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumor (RECIST) criteria for partial regression

RG7204 Antitumor Activity in Melanoma Models

(17–19). In a phase I extension study using the maximum
tolerable dose of 960 mg bid, of 27 evaluable patients with
metastatic melanoma, 18 met the RECIST criteria for partial
regression, and there was one complete regression in a patient with stage M1a disease (i.e., with cutaneous metastases;
ref. 19). It should be noted that the majority of the melanoma
patients in these studies had stage M1c disease, indicating a
poor prognosis (17–20).
This report extends the previous findings with RG7204
to panels of melanoma cell lines and other tumor cell lines
with and without the BRAFV600E mutation, further showing
the selectivity of RG7204 for BRAFV600E. We also investigated the effect of RG7204 on tumor regression and survival
in BRAFV600E-bearing melanoma tumor xenograft models
using the same high-bioavailability microprecipitated bulk
powder (MBP) formulation that is used in the clinical
trials. The data generated from these preclinical in vivo efficacy studies with melanoma xenograft models have foreshadowed the clinical results observed in patients with
metastatic melanoma.

Materials and Methods
Cell lines and reagents
The LOX IMVI (LOX) cells were provided by the Biological Testing Branch, Developmental Therapeutics Program,
Division of Cancer Treatment and Diagnosis, National
Cancer Institute-Frederick Cancer Research and Development Center. HMVII cells were purchased from the European Collection of Cell Cultures, Health Protection Agency
Culture Collections. MKN74 cells were purchased from the
Japanese Collection of Research Bioresources, Health Science
Research Resources Bank. WM239A, WM1341D, WM3152, and
WM1789 cell lines were obtained from Dr. Meenhard Herlyn
(The Wistar Institute, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA). All other cell lines were purchased from the
American Type Culture Collection. All cell lines were maintained in the designated medium (Supplementary Table S1)
supplemented with the indicated concentration of heatinactivated fetal bovine serum [Life Technologies/Bethesda
Research Laboratories (BRL)] and 2 mmol/L L-glutamine
(Life Technologies/BRL).
The following antibodies were from Cell Signaling
Technology: anti–phospho-ERK1/2 (Thr202/Tyr204), anti–
phospho-MEK1/2 (Ser217/221), and anti-MEK1/2. AntiERK1/2 antibody was from Millipore.
Cellular proliferation assays
Cellular proliferation was evaluated by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazole-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl-2H-tetrazolium bromide (MTT; Sigma)
assay. Briefly, cells were plated in 96-well microtiter plates at
a density of 1,000 to 5,000 cells per well in a volume of 180 μL.
For the assay, RG7204 was prepared at 10 times the final
assay concentration in media containing 1% DMSO. Twentyfour hours after cell plating, 20 μL of the appropriate dilution
were added to plates in duplicate. The plates were assayed for
proliferation 6 days after the cells were plated according to the

www.aacrjournals.org

procedure originally described by Mosmann (21). Percent
inhibition was calculated using the formula:


Mean absorbance of experimental wells
Percent inhibition ¼ 100 −

Mean absorbance of control wells

x 100

The IC50 was determined from the regression of a plot of
the logarithm of the concentration versus percent inhibition
by XLfit (version 4.2; IDBS) using the Dose-Response One-Site
Model (#205).
Western blot analysis
For sample preparation from cell lines, the cells were
seeded at appropriate density (70–75% confluent) in six-well
plates 1 day before compound treatment. Upon compound
treatment at various drug concentrations for 2 hours at
37°C, the cells were harvested and lysed immediately. For
sample preparation from tumor xenografts, tumors were harvested at the indicated time points and stored at −80°C. Protein was extracted by homogenization (Autogizer; TOMTEC)
in the presence of 2 to 5 mL lysis buffer. After incubation
on ice for 20 to 30 minutes, the lysates were centrifuged at
14,000 rpm for 15 minutes. The protein concentrations of
the lysates were determined.
Equal amounts of total protein for cell lysates and for tumor lysates were resolved on 4% to 12% NuPage gradient
polyacrylamide gels (Invitrogen) and blotted with the indicated antibodies. The chemiluminescent signal was generated with Enhanced Chemiluminescence Plus Western Blotting
Detection Reagents (Amersham Biosciences) and detected
with a Fujifilm LAS-3000 imager. The densitometric quantitation of specific bands was determined using the Multi
Gauge Software (Fujifilm).
Animals
Athymic nude mice (Crl:NU-Foxn1nu), ages 13 to 14 weeks,
and weighing approximately 23 to 25 g, were purchased from
Charles River Laboratories. The health of all animals was
monitored daily by gross observation and analysis of blood
samples of sentinel animals. All animal experiments were
done in accordance with protocols approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees.
Tumor xenografts
For the LOX xenografts, 2 × 106 cells in 0.2 mL of PBS were
injected s.c. into the right lateral flank. For the Colo829 and
A375 xenografts, test animals were implanted s.c. on the right
lateral flank on day 0 with 30- to 50-mg tumor fragments
using a 12-gauge trocar needle.
Test agents for in vivo studies
RG7204, formulated as MBP, was suspended at the desired
concentration as needed for each dose group in an aqueous
vehicle containing 2% Klucel LF (Hydroxypropylcellulose;
Aqualon) and adjusted to pH 4 with dilute HCl. Temozolomide (Schering-Plough) was purchased as 250-mg capsules.
Capsules were opened and combined into one bulk supply.
To prepare the stock dosing material, temozolomide was first

dissolved in 100% DMSO followed by dilution with saline to
form a final milky white suspension in 10% DMSO/90% saline
(pH 3.4).
Efficacy and safety end points
Tumor volumes were calculated using the following ellipsoid formula: [D × (d2)]/2, in which D represents the large
diameter of the tumor, and d represents the small diameter.
Tumor volumes of treated groups are presented as percentages of tumor volumes of the control groups (%T/C) using
the following formula: 100 × [(T − T0)/(C − C0)], in which
T represents mean tumor volume of a treated group on a
specific day during the experiment, T0 represents mean tumor volume of the same treated group on the first day of
treatment, C represents mean tumor volume of a control
group on the specific day during the experiment, and C0 represents mean tumor volume of the same treated group on
the first day of treatment. Percent tumor growth inhibition
was calculated as 100 − %T/C, with >100% tumor growth inhibition representing regression. Survival was calculated using a predefined cutoff volume of 2,000 mm3 as a surrogate
for mortality. The percent increase in life span was calculated
as follows:
100 ×

[(MDD-treated tumor-bearing animals) − (MDD control tumor-bearing animals)]
MDD control tumor-bearing animals

in which MDD represents median day of death. Each treatment group included 8 to 10 animals. Average percentage
weight change was used as a surrogate end point for tolerability in all experiments. Toxicity was defined as ≥20% of
mice showing ≥20% body weight loss and/or mortality. The

health status of animals was also checked daily by veterinary
staff, and tumor volume and weights were recorded two to
three times a week.
Statistical methods
Statistical analysis consisted of Mann-Whitney Rank
Sum Test, one-way ANOVA, and post hoc Bonferroni t test
(SigmaStat, version 2.0; Jandel Scientific). Survival was analyzed by the Kaplan-Meier method. Treated groups were
compared with the vehicle group, and survival comparisons between groups were analyzed by log-rank test
(GraphPad Prism, version 4.3; GraphPad Software). Differences between groups were considered significant when
the P value was ≤ 0.05.

Results
Cell line mutation status and RG7204 effects in vitro
Cellular proliferation. The effect of RG7204 on cellular
proliferation was assessed using a panel of 32 tumor cell lines
(Supplementary Table S1). BRAF, K-Ras, and N-Ras mutational status was recorded for each cell line.
In 17 melanoma cell lines, RG7204 was a potent inhibitor
of proliferation in those expressing BRAF V600E but not
BRAFWT (Fig. 1). RG7204 also potently inhibited proliferation
of melanoma cell lines expressing other codon 600 BRAF
mutations (V600D, V600K, and V600R; see Supplementary
Table S1 and Fig. 1). In addition, proliferation of the
WM1789 melanoma cell line expressing BRAFK601E was moderately inhibited by RG7204.
In cell lines from other tumor types (lung, gastric, breast,
pancreatic, and skin), RG7204 had effect only on the breast

status. The inhibition of cellular
proliferation by varying
concentrations of RG7204 was
determined by MTT assay. The
IC50 for each cell line was
determined by regression of the
inhibition data using a one-site
dose-response model. Cell lines
are color coded according to tumor
type and BRAF and Ras mutational
status.

cancer cell line MDA-MB-435, which expresses BRAFV600E
and wild-type Ras (Supplementary Table S1 and Fig. 1). None
of the other lung, gastric, breast, pancreatic, or skin cancer
cell lines tested harbor the V600E or other V600 codon mutations, and RG7204 did not inhibit their proliferation, contrasting with the consistent antiproliferative effects in
BRAFV600E mutant cell lines. IC50 values in most of these
nonresponsive cell lines were >10 μmol/L (Supplementary
Table S1; Fig. 1).
MEK and ERK phosphorylation. The effect of RG7204 on
MEK and ERK phosphorylation was investigated in melanoma cell lines expressing BRAFV600E, BRAFV600D, BRAFV600R,
BRAFG469V, or BRAFWT. As shown in Fig. 2, RG7204 inhibited
the phosphorylation of MEK and ERK in the two representative BRAF V600E-expressing melanoma cell lines, Colo829 and
LOX (Fig. 2A and B). RG7204 also inhibited MEK and ERK
phosphorylation in the WM2664 and WM1341D cell lines,
which expresses BRAF V600D and BRAF V600R , respectively
(Fig. 2C). Therefore, suppression of ERK and MEK phosphorylation by RG7204 correlates with its inhibition of cellular
proliferation in melanoma cells harboring mutations at the
V600 position.
The effect of RG7204 on MEK and ERK phosphorylation in
melanoma cell lines that do not express codon 600 BRAF mutations was more variable (Fig. 2D). In HMVII cells, which
express BRAFG469V and N-RasQ61K, RG7204 had little effect
on the phosphorylation of MEK or ERK (Fig. 2D). CHL-1 cells
express both BRAFWT and N-RasWT and have low constitutive levels of MEK and ERK phosphorylation (Fig. 2D), and
RG7204 induced MEK and ERK phosphorylation at high concentrations in CHL-1 cells (Fig. 2D). In SK-MEL-2 cells, which
express BRAFWT and N-RasQ61R, RG7204 had a biphasic effect
on MEK phosphorylation: phosphorylation was induced at
low RG7204 concentrations and inhibited at higher concentrations (Fig. 2D). RG7204 had little effect on ERK phosphorylation in the SK-MEL-2 cell line (Fig. 2D). The mechanism
underlying RG7204-induced MEK and ERK phosphorylation
is under investigation.
Cell cycle and apoptosis. The effect of RG7204 treatment
for 48 hours on the expression of cyclin D1 and cleaved poly
(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) was determined in three melanoma cell lines (Supplementary Fig. S1). In cell lines expressing BRAFV600E, A375, and Colo829, cyclin D1 expression was
decreased by RG7204 treatment, indicative of cell cycle arrest.
RG7204 did not affect cyclin D1 expression in SK-MEL-2 cells
expressing BRAFWT (Supplementary Fig. S1). RG7204 treatment was associated with increased cleavage of PARP, a marker of apoptosis, in A375 and Colo829 cells, but this effect was
not observed in SK-MEL-2 cells (Supplementary Fig. S1).
Efficacy of RG7204 in tumor xenograft models
RG7204 formulation and dosing rationale. Pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters were determined for RG7204 administered in two formulations, corn oil or MBP, in tumor-bearing
nude mice (Supplementary Table S2). A nondose proportional relationship was observed with the corn oil formulation
(Supplementary Table S2), resulting in suboptimal antitumor
efficacy (data not shown). In contrast, dose-proportional in-

www.aacrjournals.org

creases in exposure were observed in animals treated with
RG7204 in the MBP formulation (Supplementary Table S2),
suggesting that increased drug exposure, which can be
achieved with the MBP formulation, was required to achieve
optimal in vivo results. Therefore, the MBP formulation, also
used in the clinical trials, was used in the subsequent efficacy
studies reported here.
Due to a lack of toxicity, a maximum tolerable dose for
RG7204 was not reached in mice. A dose of 100 mg/kg bid
was selected as the highest dose to be tested in efficacy
studies.
RG7204 efficacy, PK, and PD in a LOX melanoma model.
The effect of three doses of RG7204 (12.5, 25, and 75 mg/kg
bid) on antitumor activity and survival was determined in
mice bearing LOX tumor xenografts (Fig. 3). RG7204 significantly inhibited tumor growth and induced tumor regression
for all three doses studied, with complete regression in 10 of
10 mice treated with 25 and 75 mg/kg bid, and five of nine
mice treated with 12.5 mg/kg bid; four of nine mice treated
with 12.5 mg/kg bid of RG7204 showed partial tumor regression (Supplementary Table S3; Fig. 3A). RG7204 significantly
increased survival relative to vehicle in a dose-responsive
manner (Supplementary Table S3; Fig. 3B).
Eight of 10 mice in the 75 mg/kg bid group were considered complete cures and died of natural causes (Supplementary Table S3). No gross signs of metastasis were observed at
necropsy (data not shown). Even after complete regression,
the tumors in the mice treated with the lower doses recurred
(data not shown).
In addition, the relationship between RG7204 concentration (PK) and effect on MEK and ERK phosphorylation
[pharmacodynamics (PD)] was investigated in the same
LOX melanoma tumor xenograft model. After a single oral
dose of RG7204 at 100 mg/kg in nude mice bearing human
LOX melanoma xenografts, tumors were harvested at various time points post dosing, and pMEK, total MEK, pERK,
and total ERK were analyzed by Western blot. The PD effects were determined by the percentage of pMEK/MEK
and pERK/ERK inhibitions in RG7204-treated tumors compared with the vehicle-treated tumor samples. There
seemed to be an association between plasma concentration
and inhibition of MEK and ERK phosphorylation, with the
highest plasma concentration (124 μmol/L at 2 h)
corresponding to the highest mean percent inhibition of
phosphorylation (70.5% for MEK and 52% for ERK; Supplementary Table S3; Fig. 4). In contrast, mean tumor concentrations of RG7204 increased slightly from 2 hours postdose
(30.2 μmol/L) to peak at 8 hours postdose (37.8 μmol/L;
Supplementary Table S3; Fig. 4). Both plasma and tumor
concentrations of RG7204 decreased to ≤3 μmol/L at
24 hours postdose (Supplementary Table S3; Fig. 4). After
peaking at 2 hours postdose, mean percent inhibition of
MEK phosphorylation remained fairly steady out to 8 hours
postdose (64.8%) and diminished to 26.0% at 24 hours postdose (Supplementary Table S3; Fig. 4). For ERK phosphorylation, mean percent inhibition showed a sharper decrease;
at 24 hours postdose, no inhibition remained (Supplementary Table S3; Fig. 4). The degree of the pathway inhibition

Figure 2. Effect of RG7204 on MEK and ERK phosphorylation in melanoma cell lines. In all panels, cells were treated with the indicated concentration
of RG7204 for 2 h before lysis. Western blot analysis was performed with antibodies specific for phospho-MEK1/2 (pMEK1/2), total MEK1/2,
phospho-ERK1/2 (pERK1/2), and total ERK1/2. A, RG7204 inhibited phosphorylation of MEK and ERK in Colo829 and LOX melanoma cell lines bearing
BRAFV600E. B, the effect of RG7204 on MEK and ERK phosphorylation in LOX cells was quantitated. Total MEK1/2 and ERK1/2 values served to normalize
pMEK1/2 and pERK1/2 values to correct for differences in protein loading. After the initial subtraction of the background signal, the ratios of pMEK1/2
to total MEK1/2 and of pERK1/2 to total ERK1/2 were determined. The value for the control sample (DMSO) was set to 100% (or 0% inhibition), and
the values for the compound-treated samples were expressed as inhibition relative to the control sample. C, RG7204 inhibited phosphorylation of MEK and
ERK in melanoma cell lines bearing other V600 BRAF mutations: WM2664 (BRAFV600D) and WM1341D (BRAFV600R). D, RG7204 had varying effects on
phosphorylation of MEK and ERK in wild-type BRAF-bearing melanoma cell lines, CHL-1 (BRAFWT) and SK-MEL2 (BRAFWT), and a noncodon 600–mutated
BRAF-bearing melanoma cell line, HMVII (BRAFG469V).

treated with RG7204 and shows good correlation between
pERK inhibition and clinical response (20).
RG7204 efficacy in a Colo829 melanoma model. The efficacy of RG7204 was compared with that of temozolomide in
mice bearing Colo829 tumor xenografts (Fig. 5A and B). Pilot
tolerability studies determined the maximum tolerable dose
of temozolomide to be 100 mg/kg once daily for 5 days (data
not shown). RG7204 at 100 mg/kg bid for 21 days showed
greatly improved antitumor activity compared both with
vehicle (P = 0.001) and with temozolomide at 100 mg/kg once
daily for 5 days (P < 0.001) at the end of the study on day 38
after the tumor cell implant (Fig. 5A). There was complete
tumor regression in all 10 mice treated with RG7204 by the
end of the study. In contrast, there was spontaneous partial
regression in one animal treated with temozolomide and no
complete regression in this group. There was no significant
difference in antitumor activity between temozolomide and
vehicle at the end of the study (P = 0.740).
Survival in the mice treated with RG7204 was significantly
better than in those treated with vehicle (P = 0.0008) or with
temozolomide (P = 0.0004; Fig. 5B). Compared with animals
in the vehicle group, RG7204-treated mice showed a 61% increased life span. Temozolomide did not significantly improve life span compared with vehicle (13%; P = 0.2986).
There was no observed toxicity for RG7204 or temozolomide
in the Colo829 tumor xenograft study.
RG7204 efficacy in an A375 melanoma model. The A375
melanoma xenograft model was used to evaluate the effect of
RG7204 on tumor growth inhibition and overall survival. In
addition, this model was used to investigate the effect of reducing the dose of RG7204, after starting at a high dose, on
antitumor activity and survival. This study design mimics the

clinical situation in which a patient's dose may need to be
reduced, and may provide insight into the effect of dose reduction in the clinical setting. Mice were given oral doses of
RG7204 at 75 or 25 mg/kg bid for 11 days, or they were given
doses of 75 mg/kg bid for 7 days followed by 25 mg/kg bid for
4 days. RG7204 had statistically equivalent tumor growth inhibition in the animals given 75 mg/kg bid and those given
75 mg/kg bid followed by 25 mg/kg bid (P > 0.05), with complete regression of the tumors in 10 of 10 mice in those treatment groups (Fig. 5C). Unlike the LOX melanoma model,
some of the regressed tumors from this study as well as
the study with the Colo829 model did recur after treatment
was stopped, even at the highest doses, although they were
significantly delayed compared with the vehicle control (data
not shown). These mice were not retreated; and therefore, it
is unknown whether tumors had developed resistance to
RG7204. Studies into the mechanisms of acquired resistance
to RG7204 treatment are ongoing.
The 75 mg/kg group and the group given 75 mg/kg followed by 25 mg/kg also had equivalent improvements in survival (P = 0.1368), with prolonged survival compared with the
vehicle control of 227% and 131%, respectively (P < 0.0001, for
both; Fig. 5D). The group given 25 mg/kg bid had a 31% increased life span compared with the vehicle group (P =

the 75 mg/kg group or the 75 mg/kg followed by 25 mg/kg
group (P = 0.0019 and P = 0.0175, respectively). Analysis of
the tumor growth inhibition associated with the two dosing
regimens did not reveal an effect of dose reduction from
75 to 25 mg/kg over a 4-day interval. Although not statistically significant, there may be a trend that suggests that mice
receiving the dose reduction had less survival benefit. This

RG7204 Antitumor Activity in Melanoma Models

Figure 5. RG7204 inhibits tumor growth and prolongs survival in two BRAFV600E-bearing melanoma xenograft models. Efficacy data are plotted as mean
tumor volume (in mm3) ± SEM. Survival data are plotted as percent of animals surviving in each group using a predefined cutoff volume of 2,000 mm3
as a surrogate for survival. A and B, mice implanted with Colo829 xenografts were treated starting 17 d after implantation. Animals were treated with vehicle
or RG7204 at a dose of 100 mg/kg bid for 21 d or with temozolomide at a dose of 100 mg/kg once daily for 5 d qd. C and D, mice implanted with
A375 xenografts were treated starting 9 d after implantation. Mice were given oral doses of RG7204 at 75 or 25 mg/kg bid for 11 d or they were given doses
of 75 mg/kg bid for 7 d followed by 25 mg/kg bid for 4 d.

may suggest that in the clinical setting, maintenance of the
highest tolerated dose may provide the greatest benefit. Further work is needed to define temporal and exposure-effect
relationships associated with dose reduction or different dose
regimens.

Discussion
Selective targeting of oncogenic mutations such as
BRAFV600E allows anticancer therapies to be directed toward
cancer cells rather than normal cells. RG7204, an inhibitor of
BRAFV600E, showed potent antitumor activity, causing dosedependent complete and partial tumor regressions in melanoma xenograft models. This effect was accompanied by an
improvement in survival and, in some cases, complete cures.
In our prior experience with the aggressive LOX melanoma
model, this phenomenon of complete cures rarely occurs

with monotherapy. The aggressive nature of the LOX model
is characterized by an exceptionally rapid growth rate, where
in general, the tumor volume observed is >3,000 mm3 at day
14 postimplantation. It is important to note that in this model, even after complete regression, tumors eventually recurred in animals in the lower dose group. This observation
may suggest use of the maximal tolerated dose in the clinical
setting for the best clinical outcome.
The substantial biochemical selectivity of RG7204 translates to minimal off-target activity and consequently overall
minimal toxicity. Because of the very low toxicity of RG7204,
a maximum tolerated dose was not achieved in the mice.
Therefore, 75 or 100 mg/kg bid were used as optimal feasible
doses for nude mice, as these doses allowed for workable suspensions for oral administration twice daily. An optimized
amorphous formulation developed for clinical studies with
much improved bioavailability enabled the achievement of

substantial compound exposures in the mouse studies. As
mentioned above, these doses resulted in complete cures in
most of the treated mice. Nonetheless, PD studies suggested
that at these doses, pathway inhibition in the tumor was incomplete. It is therefore likely that higher doses leading to
greater pathway inhibition would be even more efficacious,
further supporting the idea of using the highest tolerable
dose in clinical studies.
In both cell lines and tumor xenograft models, potent
antitumor activity of RG7204 was only observed when the
BRAFV600E mutation was present. Inhibition of downstream
signaling by RG7204 was also shown. Phosphorylation of
MEK and ERK was inhibited with RG7204 treatment in cell
lines and in tumor tissues bearing BRAFV600E, indicating
that the molecular mechanism of RG7204 is to block the
downstream signaling resulting from constitutively active
BRAFV600E. RG7204 may also be effective in treating cancers
other than melanoma, as shown by its antiproliferative activity in colorectal cancer and other tumor cell lines with
the BRAFV600E mutation and by its RG7204 antitumor activity in BRAFV600E-bearing colorectal cancer xenograft models.6 However, it seems that the specific molecular effect
of RG7204 may differ in different cell types. A previous
study in a thyroid cancer cell line showed inhibition of cell
growth but very little induction of apoptosis (16). In melanoma, acquisition of a BRAF mutation is likely a very early
event, as even benign nevi harbor the mutation (22). In other tumor types, BRAF mutations may occur at other stages
of tumorigenesis. It is likely that the response of different
types of tumors to BRAF inhibition may correlate to the

relative role of BRAF mutations in the context of coexistent
alternative signaling pathways that are driving tumor development and maintenance in a given cancer.
The effects of RG7204 translated well from biochemical selectivity, to pathway inhibition in cells, to antitumor efficacy
in vivo. Sensitivity to RG7204 correlated with activation loop
mutations in BRAF, including codon 600 and 601 mutations.
This is consistent with the binding mode that targets the
form of the kinase that is stabilized by these mutations
(23). It also should be noted that RG7204 showed no toxicity
in any tumor xenograft model tested.
In conclusion, RG7204 has shown potent antitumor activity in preclinical melanoma models in which mutant
BRAFV600E is expressed. Based on the exposures necessary
for in vivo tumor stasis and regression, benchmarks of exposure in human studies were estimated, enabling critical
decisions about dose escalations. These promising preclinical results have been corroborated by exciting phase I clinical trial data, including observations of tumor regression,
particularly in metastatic melanoma patients (17–20).
