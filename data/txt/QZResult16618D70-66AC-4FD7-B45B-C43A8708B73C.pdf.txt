ABSTRACT
The small molecule anticancer agent NSC-743380 modulates functions of
multiple cancer-related pathways and is highly active in a subset of cancer cell
lines in the NCI-60 cell line panel. It also has promising in vivo anticancer activity.
However, the mechanisms underlying NSC-743380’s selective anticancer activity
remain uncharacterized. To determine biomarkers that may be used to identify
responders to this novel anticancer agent, we performed correlation analysis on NSC743380’s anticancer activity and the gene expression levels in NCI-60 cell lines and
characterized the functions of the top associated genes in NSC-743380–mediated
anticancer activity. We found sulfotransferase SULT1A1 is causally associated with
NSC-743380’s anticancer activity. SULT1A1 was expressed in NSC-743380–sensitive
cell lines but was undetectable in resistant cancer cells. Ectopic expression of SULT1A1
in NSC743380 resistant cancer cells dramatically sensitized the resistant cells to NSC743380. Knockdown of the SULT1A1 in the NSC-743380 sensitive cancer cell line
rendered it resistance to NSC-743380. The SULT1A1 protein levels in cell lysates from
18 leukemia cell lines reliably predicted the susceptibility of the cell lines to NSC743380. Thus, expression of SULT1A1 in cancer cells is required for NSC-743380’s
anticancer activity and can be used as a biomarker for identification of NSC-743380
responders.

shown that cancer is caused by aberrations in the signaling
pathways that govern cell proliferation and differentiation,
cell survival, and genome stability because of genetic and
epigenetic alterations of “cancer driver” genes [4]. These
molecular insights into carcinogenesis have led to the
successful development of pathway-targeted anticancer
therapies, resulting in substantial improvement in clinical

Recent advances in the molecular characterization

outcomes in a subset of cancer patients [5, 6]. However,
most such pathway-targeted therapies benefit only a
limited number of patients because of the low occurrence
frequencies of genetic alterations in the therapeutic targets
[7-9]. Consequently, the success of targeted anticancer
therapy depends in large measure on biomarkers that can
identify the patient subgroups who may respond to the
therapeutic agent. Indeed, the inability to identify patient
responders is one of major challenges in anticancer drug
development, not only causing a failure to demonstrate
the potential benefit of a promising anticancer agent [10,
11] but also exposing patients to the risks of ineffective
treatment. This was exemplified by the discovery that
overexpression or mutation in epidermal growth factor
receptors is associated with response to trastuzumab [12,
13], gefitinib [14-16], or erlotinib [14] and can be used
for patient selection in the treatment of breast or lung
cancers. It is noteworthy that both gefitinib [10] and
erlotinib [17, 18] failed to show a benefit in randomized
phase III trials with unselected patient populations. Thus,
a reliable predictive biomarker is essential to the success
of anticancer drug development.
We have recently developed a novel anticancer
agent, designated NSC-743380, through chemical library
screening of isogenic cells with or without a mutant KRAS
gene [19] and through lead compound optimization [2022]. Mechanistic characterization revealed that NSC743380 and its analogues induced apoptosis in sensitive
cancer cells [19-21], inhibited phosphorylation of RNA
polymerase II [22, 23], induced sustained JNK activation
by inhibiting its dephosphorylation [21], induced reactive
oxygen species (ROS) accumulation [24], inhibited STAT3
phosphorylation, and suppressed cyclin D1 expression
[20], suggesting that these compounds modulate multiple
cancer-related targets. NSC-743380 is highly active
(median growth inhibitory concentration [IC50] between
10 nM and 1 M) in vitro in 30 of 102 cancer cell lines
tested [20, 25], including many KRAS mutant cancer cells
[19, 21, 25]. In vivo studies showed that NSC-743380
can induce complete tumor regression or significant
growth suppression in several xenograft tumor models
at doses that did not cause noticeable adverse effects,
demonstrating a wide safety margin and the strong
possibility of advancing this agent to clinical trials [20,
25].
Nevertheless, although the lead compound was
identified through synthetic lethality screening using
KRAS mutant cells [19], the anticancer activity of NSC743380 in the NCI-60 cell panel and in 50 human non–
small cell lung carcinoma cell lines did not show a
significant correlation with KRAS mutations, because
a substantial number of KRAS wild-type cancer cells
were also highly susceptible to NSC-743380 [20, 25].
Therefore, identifying a biomarker that can predict
treatment response to NSC-743380 will be critical for
future translation into clinical application. To this end, we
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

performed correlation analysis on the IC50 values of NSC743380 in NCI-60 cancer cell lines and levels of mRNA
in those cell lines and determined the causal relationship
of the candidate genes in NSC-743380–induced anticancer
activity. Our results demonstrated that NSC-743380’s
antitumor activity is dependent on the expression of a
sulfotransferase (SULT), SULT1A1, a biotransformation
enzyme that bioactivates a number of procarcinogens [2631].

RESULTS
Association of NSC-743380 anticancer activity
and gene expression levels in NCI-60 cell lines
We previously reported the anticancer activity of
NSC-743380 in NCI-60 cancer cell lines and showed that
NSC-743380 is highly active in a subset of these lines
[20]. To identify biomarkers that can be used to predict
response to NSC-743380–induced anticancer activity, we
performed Spearman rank tests and Pearson correlation
tests to assess whether there were correlations between
anticancer activity (-log10 GI50) and mRNA levels based
on Affymetrix U133A chips (downloaded from the NCI
Molecular Target Database, http://discover.nci.nih.gov/
cellminer/loadDownload.do). A false discovery rate (FDR)
of 5% was used to select genes whose mRNA levels were
significantly correlated with NSC-743380’s antitumor
activity. At FDR of 5%, only SULT1A1 was selected to
correlate with NSC-743380’s anticancer activity (r = 0.56,
p=4.13 x10-6) (Fig. 1A).

SULT1A1 is causally associated with NSC743380–induced antitumor activity
To determine whether SULT1A1 expression has a
causal relationship with NSC-743380 susceptibility, we
transfected NSC-743380 resistant H1299 lung cancer
cells with a plasmid expressing SULT1A1 together with
a plasmid expressing GFP. Cells were then treated with 1
µM NSC-743380 to test whether GFP-expressing sensitive
cells became resistant or resistant cells became sensitive.
Although transfecting the H1299 cells with the SULT1A1expressing plasmid or treating the cells with NSC-743380
alone did not change the cell morphology, treatment of
SULT1A1-transfected H1299 cells induced cell killing
of the transfected cells only and not non-transfected cells
(Fig. 1B). With the same approach, we tested 10 additional
genes on the top list of correlations based on Pearson
correlation analysis but was not selected based on FDR of
5%, including BAIAP2, EBI3, REST, CLSTN2, EIF4G3,
and BMI1. Constitutively active STAT3 and AKT1 were
also included in the study because our previously studies
implicated that STAT3 partially contributes to NSC346

743380 induced anticancer activity [20]. However, the
results showed that none of those genes test could sensitize
the H1299 cells to NSC-743380, or cause resistance in
NSC-743380 sensitive kidney cell line A498 (data not
shown).
We then performed quantitative PCR analysis on
SULT1A1 mRNA in two sensitive (H460 and H157) and
two resistant (H322 and H1299) lung cancer cell lines.
The results showed that SULT1A1 is highly expressed
in the sensitive cells but barely detectable in the resistant
cells (Fig. 2A). Western blot analysis also showed that all
four sensitive cell lines (H460, H157, A498, and H522)
had a clear band of SULT1A1 that was not detectable in
the resistant cells (Fig. 2B), consistent with the association
between NSC-743380’s activity and SULT1A1 mRNA
levels observed in the NCI-60 cell lines.

To further validate the effect of SULT1A1 in
NSC-743380-induced antitumor activity, we performed
retrovirus-mediated gene stable overexpression or
knockdown analysis. Retroviral vector–mediated stable
transfection of SULT1A1 into H1299 cells rendered the
cells highly susceptible to NSC-743380. The IC50 values
for parental or vector-transfected H1299 cells were >10
µM, whereas in SULT1A1-transfected H1299 cells it
was about 0.01 µM, a 1000-fold difference (Fig. 3A, B).
Interestingly, we found that other major SULT isoforms
tested, including SULT1A3, SULT1A4, SULT2A1, and
SULT4A1, could not sensitize H1299 cells to NSC-743380
(data not shown), suggesting that SULT1A1 is relatively

sulfoxide (DMSO) for 12 hours. The panel shows cell morphology under regular and fluorescent microscopes. Transfection with SULT1A1
alone did not induce cell death (see DMSO group), whereas NSC-743380 induced cell death in transfected cells only (green cells in the
treated group).

specific for NSC-743380’s anticancer activity. Moreover,
knockdown of SULT1A1 in Calu3 cells by retrovirusmediated shRNA expression diminished the sensitivity of
those cells to NSC-743380 (more than 100-fold increase in
IC50) (Fig. 3C, D). These results further demonstrated that
SULT1A1 expression is causally associated with NSC743380–induced antitumor activity.

viability was determined by using MTS assay as described
previously [32]. The results showed that all four cell lines
expressing SULT1A1 were sensitive to NSC-743380, with
IC50 values between 0.03 and 0.3 µM, whereas the two
SULT1A1-negative cell lines were resistant, with IC50 >3
µM (Fig. 4B), demonstrating that SULT1A1 expression
can be used to identify sensitive cancer cells in vitro.

SULT1A1 as a predicting biomarker for response
to NSC-743380 in leukemia cell lines

DISCUSSION
Our study demonstrated that NSC-743380’s
anticancer activity is causally associated with SULT1A1
expression in cancer cells and that SULT1A1 expression
can be used as a biomarker to predict response or identify
responders to NSC-743380.
Sulfotransferases are a family of biotransformative
enzymes that catalyze the sulfation of numerous
xenobiotics, drugs, and endogenous compounds, leading
to an increase in the compound’s solubility and often a
decrease in its biological activity [33]. At least 11 distinct
cytosolic SULTs have been identified in humans [33],
and some of these enzymes, including SULT1A1, are
known to bioactivate compounds such as procarcinogens
[26-31]. Because of the role of SULTs in carcinogenmediated malignant transformation, their overexpression

To test whether expression of SULT1A1 in other
cancer cells can be used to predict responses to NSC743380, we used Western blot analysis to determine
SULT1A1 expression in cell lysates from 18 leukemia
cell lines. Lysates from the A498 kidney cell line, which
is highly sensitive to NSC-743380 both in vitro and in
vivo [20], were used as positive control. The Western blot
analysis showed that SULT1A1 was expressed in four
of the leukemia lines: U937, M-07e, MV4-11, and THP1 (Fig. 4A). We then performed the cell viability assay
on six leukemia cell lines, including the four lines that
expressed SULT1A1 and two cell lines (HL-60 and OCI/
AML3) that did not. Cells were treated with NSC-743380
at doses ranging from 0.003 to 3 µM for 72 hours, and cell

lysates of 18 leukemia cell lines. The cell lysates were harvested several years ago and stored them in a –80°C freezer. Cell lysates from
the kidney cell line A498 were used as positive control. The results showed that U937, M07e, MV4-11, and THP-1 were positive for
SULT1A1 proteins. β-Actin was used as loading control. B) Cell viability assay for six leukemia cell lines. The cells were treated with
various concentrations of NSC-743380. Cell viability was determined 3 days after treatment using the MTS assay. Control cells (indicated
by the 0 in the concentration) were treated with solvent (dimethyl sulfoxide), and their value was set as 1. The values represent mean ± SD
of a quadruplet assay. The assay repeated at least twice with similar results.

cells with different KRAS mutations may have different
metabolic profiles [55]. Interestingly, KRAS mutations
are more common in smoking-associated cancers [5658]. Intriguingly, SULT1A1 is capable of bioactivating
procarcinogens [26-31] and likely plays a role in tobaccoinduced carcinogenesis. Whether oncogenic KRAS is
involved in regulating SULT1A1 expression, or whether
SULT1A1 overexpression promotes smoking-induced
KRAS mutations, remains to be determined. Nevertheless,
the fact that KRAS transfected cells, but not the parental
cells, were highly susceptible to oncrasin-1 and NSC743380 [19, 22] indicates that KRAS may upregulate
SULT1A1 in some cancer cells, and that SULT1A1
overexpression may occur in a subset of cancers with
activation of RAS signaling pathways. The differential
expression of SULT1A1 in tumor tissues versus
neighboring normal tissues [35] suggests that expression
of SULT1A1 in tumors, but not the germ line SULT1A1
haplotypes, is a more appropriate biomarker to identify
responders for therapeutics activated by SULT1A1. Our
results strongly suggest that expression levels of some
procarcinogen-activating enzymes in cancers can be
exploited as a biomarker for identifying responders of
some anticancer agents.

is expected to render a cell more susceptible to malignant
transformation by SULT-activated carcinogens and
could be a marker for a subtype of carcinogen-induced
cancers. Indeed, members of the SULT1A subfamily have
been found to be highly expressed in breast cancer cell
lines but were not detected in normal human mammary
epithelial cells [34]. The expression of SULT1A1 was
readily detectable in primary breast cancer tissues but
not in neighboring normal tissues [35], and SULT1A1
activity was drastically higher in hepatocellular carcinoma
patients [36]. Patients with liver cirrhosis who had higher
SULT1A1 activity had a higher risk of developing
hepatocellular carcinoma than did such patients with
normal SULT1A1 activity. However, there is a huge gap in
our knowledge concerning the expression status of SULTs
in tumor tissues versus normal tissues, although expression
of some SULT isoforms in certain normal human tissues
has been reported [37-39]. Several studies have been
performed to determine the association between SULT1A1
polymorphic alleles in blood cells and the risk of breast
cancer [40-42], lung cancer [43, 44], colorectal cancer
[45, 46], bladder cancer [47], and brain tumors [48], but
the results have been inconsistent. Nevertheless, the more
active allele of SULT1A1 has been associated with better
survival outcome in breast cancer patients treated with
tamoxifen [49], possibly because the SULT1A1-mediated
biotransformation of 4-hydroxytamoxifen potentiates the
efficacy of tamoxifen therapy [35]. SULT1A1 has also
been reported to be required for the anticancer activity of
aminoflavone, an aryl-hydrocarbon receptor ligand [50],
suggesting that SULT1A1 could play an important role in
anticancer therapy. Together, the results from this study
and the studies on tamoxifen [49] and aminoflavone [50]
suggest that intratumoral expression of SULT1A1 may
serve as a bioactivator for some anticancer agents and as a
biomarker to identify responders to those therapeutics in a
subgroup of cancer patients.
NSC743380 is derived from the lead compound
oncrasin-1, which was identified through synthetic
lethality screening on isogenic cells with or without a
mutant KRAS gene [19]. Activating mutations in oncogenic
RAS genes are among the first and the most common
genetic alterations identified in human cancers [51, 52].
Extensive efforts have been made to develop therapeutics
targeting to RAS signaling pathways [6, 52], however,
effective anti-RAS therapeutics is not yet clinically
available. Our previous studies revealed that NSC743380
is highly active in a number of KRAS mutant cancer cell
lines [20, 25]. Nevertheless, the correlations between
NSC-743380’s anticancer activity and KRAS mutations in
the NCI-60 cell lines and in the 50 tested lung cancer cell
lines were not significant [20, 25]. A possible explanation
is that KRAS mutant cancer cells can be categorized as
KRAS-dependent and KRAS-independent [53], and that
RAS activation signatures are observed in substantial
numbers of RAS wilt-type tumors [54]. Moreover, cancer

METHODS
Cell lines and cell culture
The human non–small cell lung carcinoma cell lines
were routinely grown in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s
medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum
and 100 µg/mL penicillin-streptomycin (all from Life
Technologies), as previously described [25]. Cells were
cultured at 37°C in a humidified incubator containing 5%
CO2. Leukemia cell lines were obtained from the American
Type Culture Collection. The culture conditions were the
same as above. The cell lines were regularly authenticated
with short tandem repeat fingerprint method.

Chemicals and reagents
NSC-743380 was synthesized as previously
described [22]. Antibody against SULT1A1 was obtained
from R&D Systems and antibody for β-actin from Sigma.
The pEGFP-N1 plasmid for expressing green fluorescent
protein (GFP) was obtained from Clontech. The plasmids
expressing constitutively active STAT3 (STAT3CA) and
AKT1 (AKT1CA) were described previously [20, 59]. All
other plasmids expressing cDNAs or short hairpin RNA
(shRNA) were obtained from either Origene Technologies
or Open Biosystems. All plasmids expressing cDNAs
were verified by DNA sequencing performed at the Sanger
DNA Sequencing Core Facility at our institution.

Plasmid transfection and retrovirus infection

Membranes were then blocked with PBS buffer containing
5% low-fat milk and 0.05% Tween (PBST) for 1 hour and
then incubated with primary antibodies overnight at 4°C.
After being washed three times with PBST, membranes
were incubated with peroxidase-conjugated secondary
antibodies for 1 hour at room temperature. The membranes
were washed with PBST again and developed with a
chemiluminescence detection kit (ECL kit, Amersham
Bioscience). β-actin was used as a loading control.

Plasmid transfection was performed using the
FuGENE6 reagent (Promega). Cells were transfected with
a plasmid encoding a gene to be tested and pEGFP-N1
at a ratio of 1:1 for 24 hours and then treated with 1 µM
NSC-743380 overnight. The morphology of transfected
cells was observed under the fluorescent microscope.
For establishing stable gene expression or knockdown,
retrovirus or lentivirus was produced in 293/Phoenix
cells and used for infecting cells as described previously
[21]. Stable transfectants were selected for growth in the
presence of 500–800 µg/ml G418 (Geneticin) or 1–5 µg/
ml puromycin, based on the selection marker in the vector
backbones. The selected cells were pooled together for the
studies.

Statistical analysis
Differences between treatment groups were assessed
using the unpaired Student’s t test at a significance level
of P < 0.05. For analysis of correlations between gene
expression and NSC-743380’s activity in the NCI60 cell lines, the Affymetrix U133A and U133B gene
expression microarray data were downloaded from the
National Cancer Institute website (http://discover.nci.nih.
gov/cellminer/loadDownload.do). The expression levels
were quantified using the Robust Multiarray Analysis
method. Spearman rank tests (not assuming normality)
and Pearson correlation (assuming normality) were
used to assess whether there were associations between
anticancer activity and gene expression. A beta-uniform
mixture (BUM) model [60] was used to estimate the false
discovery rate (FDR).

Cell viability assay
Cell viability for monolayer cells was determined by
using the sulforhodamine B (SRB) assay as we described
previously [21]. Cell viability for suspension cell cultures
was determined by using [3-(4,5 dimethylthiazol-2-yl)5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2Htetrazolium (MTS) as described previously [32]. Each
experiment was performed in quadruplicate and repeated
at least three times. The IC50 valuewas determined by
using the CurveExpert Version 1.3 program.
