ABSTRACT
Multidrug resistance (MDR) is a primary hindrance to curative cancer
chemotherapy. In this respect, lysosomes were suggested to play a role in intrinsic
MDR by sequestering protonated hydrophobic weak base chemotherapeutics away
from their intracellular target sites. Here we show that intrinsic resistance to
sunitinib, a hydrophobic weak base tyrosine kinase inhibitor known to accumulate
in lysosomes, tightly correlates with the number of lysosomes accumulating high
levels of sunitinib in multiple human carcinoma cells. Furthermore, exposure of
cancer cells to hydrophobic weak base drugs leads to a marked increase in the
number of lysosomes per cell. Non-cytotoxic, nanomolar concentrations, of the
hydrophobic weak base chemotherapeutics doxorubicin and mitoxantrone triggered
rapid lysosomal biogenesis that was associated with nuclear translocation of TFEB,
the dominant transcription factor regulating lysosomal biogenesis. This resulted in
increased lysosomal gene expression and lysosomal enzyme activity. Thus, treatment
of cancer cells with hydrophobic weak base chemotherapeutics and their consequent
sequestration in lysosomes triggers lysosomal biogenesis, thereby further enhancing
lysosomal drug entrapment and MDR. The current study provides the first evidence
that drug-induced TFEB-associated lysosomal biogenesis is an emerging determinant
of MDR and suggests that circumvention of lysosomal drug sequestration is a novel
strategy to overcome this chemoresistance.

is a burning need to decipher the molecular mechanisms
underlying inherent and acquired drug resistance. This
should pave the way towards the development of novel
strategies to overcome various mechanisms of MDR [9, 10].
Lysosomes are acidic intracellular organelles
containing various acidic hydrolases that play a key
physiologic role in the breakdown of macromolecules
including nucleic acids, proteins, lipids and polysaccharides.
Moreover, lysosomes have been shown to take active
part in various cellular processes including recycling of
defective organelles, engulfment of bacteria and viruses,
exocytosis, apoptosis and autophagy [11–13]. Recently,
lysosomal biogenesis was found to be triggered by the
translocation of transcription factor EB (TFEB) from the
cytoplasm to the nucleus [14]. TFEB is a master regulator
that activates the transcription of genes in the Coordinated

INTRODUCTION
Chemotherapy remains the primary treatment
modality of various human malignancies. However,
multidrug resistance (MDR), a phenomenon in which
tumor cells display resistance to multiple structurally
and functionally unrelated anticancer drugs, is a primary
hindrance to curative cancer therapy [1–3]. Numerous
mechanisms of MDR have been described including
decreased drug uptake, increased drug efflux via
overexpression of MDR efflux transporters of the ATPbinding cassette (ABC) superfamily, quantitative and
qualitative alterations in intracellular drug target proteins,
as well as evasion of apoptosis [1, 3–8]. Since MDR is
believed to be one of the leading causes of the limited
success of multiple chemotherapeutic regimens, there

Lysosomal Expression and Regulation (CLEAR) network
responsible for the biogenesis and function of lysosomes
[12, 15, 16]. TFEB-mediated lysosomal biogenesis was
shown to be induced by different stimuli such as aberrant
lysosomal storage, cell starvation and pharmacologic
inhibition of the key growth regulator, mTOR complex 1
(mTORC1) [14]. The latter is a kinase that was shown to
inhibit TFEB activity by phosphorylating it and preventing
its translocation from the cytoplasm to the nucleus.
Specifically, TFEB is phosphorylated at Ser211 in an
mTORC1-dependent manner; this TFEB phosphorylation
promotes its association with members of the YWHA (143-3) family of proteins resulting in the retention of TFEB in
the cytosol in a transcriptionally inactive form [17].
Lysosomes have been shown to sequester
lipophilic amine drugs through a non-enzymatic and
non-transporter mediated process known as lysosomal
trapping or lysosomal sequestration [18–21]. Lipophilic
amine drugs with weak base properties readily diffuse
across cell membranes at physiologic pH via passive
diffusion. However, upon entry into acidic lysosomes and
late endosomes, they undergo protonation and are hence

entrapped in lysosomes in their cationic state [22]. In
this respect, we as well as others have previously shown
that certain hydrophobic weak base chemotherapeutics
such as the anthracyclines doxorubicin, daunorubicin
and mitoxantrone, imidazoacridinones, as well as the
multitargeted receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor sunitinib,
highly accumulate in lysosomes [20, 23–28] (Table 1),
thereby being sequestered away from their intracellular
target sites. Indeed, it has been suggested that lysosomal
drug sequestration may abolish the drug-induced cytotoxic
effect, due to markedly decreased drug concentrations at the
target site [18, 29]. In this respect, it has been previously
demonstrated that the extent of lysosomal drug sequestration
depends on the pH gradient between the acidic luminal pH
of the lysosome and the cytoplasm [30]. Hence, lysosomal
drug accumulation can be reversed by cell treatment with
lysosome alkalinizing agents such as bafilomycin A1, a
vesicular H+-ATPase inhibitor [25, 31]. These findings
suggest that well-tolerated lysosome alkalinization
agents may be used to increase cytotoxic drug efficacy
by abolishing lysosomal drug sequestration. Moreover, it
has been shown that differences in the lysosome-cytosol

RESULTS

pH gradient between MDR cancer cells and their parental
drug sensitive cell lines have a major impact on differential
lysosomal drug accumulation in these cells, and thus on
intracellular drug distribution and pharmacologic activity
[30]. Interestingly, some recent evidence suggests that
certain MDR transporters of the ABC superfamily such
as ABCB1 (P-gp) are overexpressed and targeted to the
lysosomal membrane, thereby further actively enhancing
ATP-driven intralysosomal drug sequestration [32, 33].
Collectively, these findings suggest that
lysosomes may be an important determinant of intrinsic
chemoresistance, and that a better understanding of
the mechanisms underlying lysosome-mediated drug
resistance may lead to the discovery of novel treatment
strategies that could readily overcome this type of MDR
[9, 10]. As a step towards this end, we here investigated
the impact of lysosomal accumulation of hydrophobic
weak base anticancer drugs on the onset of lysosomal
biogenesis, and on the increase in lysosome number
in cancer cells. We show that the number of lysosomes
which accumulated high levels of sunitinib, remarkably
correlates with the intrinsic resistance to this anti-tumor
agent in multiple human carcinoma cells of distinct
tissue lineage. We further demonstrate that hydrophobic
weak base drugs induce a marked increase in lysosomal
biogenesis that is mediated by induction of the CLEAR
pathway regulated by nuclear translocation of TFEB.
Hence, drug-induced lysosomal biogenesis and lysosomal
drug sequestration is an emerging determinant of MDR,
and abrogation of lysosomal drug sequestration may
overcome this mode of chemoresistance.

Lysosomal drug accumulation protects nuclei
from cytotoxic drugs
Here we postulated that lysosomal sequestration
of hydrophobic weak base anticancer drugs prevents
their accessibility to their intracellular target sites, hence
abolishing their pharmacologic activity. In this respect,
we hypothesized that cells with an increased lysosome
number have an enhanced lysosomal sequestration
capacity of hydrophobic weak base cytotoxic drugs. This
should result in a markedly decreased drug concentration
at the drug target site and consequently increased drug
resistance. To test this hypothesis, MCF-7 cells which we
found to contain a low number of lysosomes, as well as
A549/K1.5 MDR non-small cell lung cancer cells, known
to harbor high levels of lysosomes [25], were exposed
for 1 hr to the imidazoacridinone C-1330 (10 μM) along
with the viable lysosome fluorescent marker LysoTracker
red (100 nM), followed by fluorescence microscopy.
C-1330 is a naturally fluorescent cytotoxic topoisomerase
II inhibitor which we recently found to undergo a dramatic
compartmentalization in lysosomes [25]; hence, in order
to exert its topoisomerase II inhibitory activity, C-1330
must reach the nucleus. MCF-7 cells which contain a low
number of lysosomes per cell displayed a high confinement
of C-1330 fluorescence in their nuclei (Fig. 1). In contrast,
C-1330 fluorescence in MDR A549/ K1.5 cells which
contain a high number of lysosomes was predominantly
confined to lysosomes rather than to the nucleus. This

between the elevated number of lysosomes per cell, and
the lysosome-dependent protection of intracellular drug
target sites from cytotoxic drug activity.

drugs may also result in enhanced lysosomal biogenesis,
leading to a further increase in the number of lysosomes
per cell. Towards this end, MCF-7 cells which contain a
low number of lysosomes per cell, were exposed for 24 hr
to a single dose (100 nM) of several cytotoxic drugs that
were previously shown to undergo lysosomal sequestration
including doxorubicin, mitoxantrone, C-1330 and sunitinib
[23–25]. The anti-malarial drug chloroquine (100 μM), a
well-established lysosomotropic agent which we recently
showed to induce a marked increase in lysosome size and
number [25], was used here as positive control. A marked
increase in the number of lysosomes per cell was observed
for all of these hydrophobic weak base drugs by fluorescence
microscopy (Fig. 3A). In order to demonstrate the dosedependent relationship of the drug-induced increase in
lysosome number, MCF-7 cells were exposed to increasing
concentrations of mitoxantrone for 72 hr, followed by viable
cell staining with LysoTracker red, and were assessed by
fluorescence microscopy and computational analysis. The
results of this computational analysis that are depicted
in Fig. 3B were obtained based on an examination of 40
microscope fields, representing 500–1000 cells from each
sample. This analysis revealed a 2.7-fold increase in the
number of lysosomes per cell after an exposure to subcytotoxic mitoxantrone concentrations as low as 10 nM,
representing less than 6% of the IC50 (which was 170 nM
for a 72 hr mitoxantrone treatment) as determined by a
colorimetric XTT cell proliferation assay. The maximal
increase in lysosomal number per cell in MCF-7 cells was
achieved with 30 nM mitoxantrone, which led to a 3.9-fold
increase in the number of lysosomes per cell, along with a
1.9-fold increase in the mean size of lysosomes (determined
as the cross-sectional lysosomal area) as well as a mean
of 1.4-fold increase in lysosome fluorescence intensity (an
indicator of lysosome ability to accumulate LysoTracker red).
Collectively, these results indicate an estimated increase of
up to 16.4-fold in the total volume of cell lysosomes upon
exposure to 30 nM mitoxantrone.

Increased lysosome number per cell correlates
with inherent resistance to sunitinib
Based on these results, we further hypothesized
that cells harboring a higher number of lysosomes may
exhibit an increased intrinsic resistance to hydrophobic
weak base drugs that are prone to undergo marked
sequestration in lysosomes. To test this hypothesis, several
drug-naïve human tumor cell lines of epithelial origin
(i.e. carcinoma) were used including: ovarian carcinoma
(2008 and IGROV-1), non-small cell lung cancer (A549),
cervical carcinoma (HeLa), nasopharyngeal carcinoma
(KB-3-1), gastric carcinoma (EPG85-257P) as well as
normal human embryonic kidney cells (HEK293). The
different cell lines were tested for their sensitivity to
the protein tyrosine kinase inhibitor sunitinib, which we
have recently shown to highly accumulate in lysosomes
[23]. We also quantified the number of lysosomes per
cell in all these tumor cell lines using fluorescence
microscopy. We observed a striking linear correlation
(R2 = 0.92) between mean lysosome number per cell and
the inherent resistance of the various tumor cell lines to
sunitinib (Fig. 2A). These results suggest that increased
accumulation of sunitinib in lysosomes confers upon the
tumor cells an intrinsic resistance to this hydrophobic
weak base drug. To determine whether this innate
resistance is indeed dependent on lysosomal sequestration
of the drug, the correlation of the lysosome number in the
above tumor cell lines was also compared to the cytotoxic
activity of two widely used anticancer drugs that do not
undergo lysosomal sequestration, the fluoropyrimidine
5-fluorouracil (5-FU), and the antifolate pemetrexed
(PMX), both of which inhibit thymidylate synthase,
a key enzyme in pyrimidine nucleotide biosynthesis
(Fig. 2B and 2C, respectively). No correlation whatsoever
was observed between lysosome number per cell and
tumor cell sensitivity to these established anti-tumor
agents. These findings suggest that increased lysosome
number per cell is likely to serve as a marker for inherent
resistance to hydrophobic weak base drugs that are prone
to undergo marked accumulation in lysosomes.

Drug-induced lysosomal biogenesis is associated
with the translocation of TFEB from the
cytoplasm to the nucleus in malignant and
non-malignant human cell lines
We next explored the factors regulating hydrophobic
weak base drug-induced lysosomal biogenesis. In this
respect, TFEB, a master transcription regulator, was
previously shown to trigger lysosomal biogenesis upon its
translocation from the cytoplasm to the nucleus [14]. To
examine the impact of hydrophobic weak base drug exposure
on the possible translocation of TFEB from the cytoplasm
to the nucleus, three human malignant and non-malignant
cell lines were transfected with FLAG-tagged TFEB using
both stable and transient transfection approaches. MCF-

Exposure of MCF-7 cells to hydrophobic weak

was performed by monitoring the number of green fluorescent lysosomes (i.e. sunitinib-accumulating lysosomes and acidic vesicles; shown

in agreement with previous studies [14, 16]. In contrast,

the lysosomotropic agent chloroquine which was used in
MCF-7 cells as a positive control, a marked increase in the
translocation of FLAG-tagged TFEB from the cytoplasm
to the nucleus was observed. Hence, these findings support

that this nuclear translocation of TFEB was associated with
an actual transactivation of lysosomal gene expression, we
performed quantitative real-time PCR analysis to determine
the gene expression levels of glucosamine (N-Acetyl)-6sulfatase (GNS) and cathepsin D (CTSD); GNS and CTSD
are bona fide lysosomal genes in the CLEAR pathway that
were previously shown to be up-regulated upon activation of
lysosomal biogenesis as part of the TFEB-regulated CLEAR
gene network [16]. As expected from the marked nuclear
localization of TFEB upon exposure to lipophilic weak base
drugs, the gene expression levels of both GNS (Fig. 5A)
and CTSD (Fig. 5B) were significantly elevated after 24 hr
exposure of MCF-7 cells to mitoxantrone. These results
provide the first direct evidence for hydrophobic weak base
chemotherapeutic drug-induced increase in lysosome number
in cancer cells, hence indicating that single dose exposure to
lipophilic weak base drugs, such as mitoxantrone, triggers
enhanced lysosomal biogenesis in cancer cells.
We next assessed whether or not the increases in both
the mRNA levels of these lysosomal markers as well as in
lysosome number per cell were associated with a consistent
increase in the catalytic activity of the established lysosomal
enzyme β-hexosaminidase. We have previously shown
that β-hexosaminidase is a bona fide functional marker of
the number of lysosomes per cell [29]. MCF-7 cells were
exposed to increasing concentrations of mitoxantrone,

www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

followed by extraction of cell lysates and determination of
β-hexosaminidase activity. A dose-dependent increase in
β-hexosaminidase activity was induced by mitoxantrone
concentrations as low as 30 nM after 24 hr drug exposure
(Fig. 6A). After 72 hr of drug exposure, the increase in
β-hexosaminidase activity was evident at drug concentrations
as low as 10 nM (Fig. 6B).
Based on our current findings we propose an
integrative model for hydrophobic weak base druginduced lysosome-dependent drug resistance (Fig. 7).
Hydrophobic weak base drugs enter the lysosomes by
simple diffusion, become irreversibly protonated in the
highly acidic lysosomes or late endosomes, undergo
dramatic accumulation and consequently become
irreversibly sequestered therein. In turn, lysosomal drug
entrapment triggers TFEB-mediated lysosomal biogenesis
via dephosphorylation of TFEB and its translocation
from the cytoplasm to the nucleus. In the nucleus,
this transcriptional master regulator transactivates the
expression of multiple genes in the CLEAR pathway,
thereby leading to lysosomal biogenesis and consequently
marked increase in lysosome number per cell. Increased
lysosomal number per cell increases the efficiency of
lysosomal drug sequestration, with lysosomes acting as a
sink pulling hydrophobic weak base drugs away from their
cellular target sites, hence rendering tumor cells MDR.

DISCUSSION

We therefore propose here that an increased number of
lysosomes per cell and consequently enhanced lysosomal
entrapment of lipophilic weak base anticancer drugs may
prove a novel dismal prognostic factor that correlates
with intrinsic resistance to these chemotherapeutics,
some of which are listed in Table 1. Accordingly, from
a personalized medicine perspective, the number of
lysosomes in malignant cells may prove a significant factor
that has to be taken into consideration when selecting the

Our current findings constitute the first
demonstration that the natural variation in lysosome
number between various drug-naïve cancer cells is
an emerging determinant of the intrinsic resistance to
lipophilic weak base cytotoxic agents such as sunitinib.
In this respect, we have recently shown that sunitinib
undergoes marked sequestration in lysosomes [23].

treatment of choice for individual cancer patients. Hence,
dedicated retrospective studies with various carcinoma
specimens exploring the impact of increased number
of lysosomes on intrinsic chemoresistance and poor
prognosis are warranted.
It has been previously shown that lysosomal stress
triggers lysosomal biogenesis [16]. In the current paper
several lines of evidence are presented to support our
hypothesis that exposure of cancer cells to hydrophobic
weak base drugs, and consequent sequestration of these
drugs in lysosomes, triggers TFEB-associated lysosomal
biogenesis: a) treatment of various drug-naïve cancer
cells as well as non-malignant cells with hydrophobic
weak base drugs that are highly sequestered in lysosomes,
results in a dominant translocation of a FLAG-tagged
TFEB from the cytoplasm to the nucleus. These results
were consistently obtained both upon transient and stable
transfections of FLAG-tagged TFEB, as well as using
two distinct transfection techniques including a linear
polyethylenimine-based transfection reagent (JetPEITM)
as well as electroporation. b) This translocation of
TFEB from the cytoplasm to the nucleus resulted in the
induction of expression of genes in the CLEAR network
including GNS and CTCS. c) This was consistently
associated with enhanced lysosomal enzyme activity as
evidenced by the dose-dependent increase in the activity
of the lysosomal enzyme β-hexosaminidase which we
previously used as a lysosomal enzyme marker [29]. These
alterations consistently resulted in a marked increase in
cell lysosome number, size and capacity, as indicated by
the enhanced lysosomal accumulation of LysoTracker
red. It is noteworthy that LysoTracker red is sequestered
in lysosomes in an acidic pH-dependent manner, much
like hydrophobic weak base drugs (Table 1). We therefore
propose that the ability of lysosomes to accumulate
LysoTracker red in a given cancer cell is a reliable
indication of the capacity of these lysosomes to sequester
hydrophobic weak base drugs. These findings along with
evidence indicating that an elevated lysosome number
per cell renders cancer cells resistant to hydrophobic
weak base drugs, suggest that lysosome-mediated drug
resistance may also be an acquired mechanism of drug
resistance, in addition to any pre-existing (i.e. intrinsic)
MDR-dependent trait. We therefore propose that targeting
the lysosomal biogenesis pathway by circumventing
translocation of TFEB from the cytoplasm to the nucleus,
may prevent drug-induced lysosome-mediated resistance,
thereby increasing the efficacy of anticancer treatment
with hydrophobic weak base drugs.
One of the key inevitable questions that arises
from the proposed model that we present here (Fig. 7) is
how lysosomal accumulation of hydrophobic weak base
drugs is perceived by cells as lysosomal damage or stress,
hence inducing TFEB-dependent CLEAR pathway, and
consequent lysosomal biogenesis. One plausible explanation
relies on the established lysosomal alkalinization effect
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

that hydrophobic weak basic compounds have upon
marked accumulation in lysosomes. Indeed, exposure to
hydrophobic weak base compounds was found to induce
lysosomal alkalinization [20, 34, 35], which in turn was
found to disrupt lysosomal activity [36]. It is interesting to
note that according to this scenario, and given that druginduced lysosomal biogenesis is mediated by drug-induced
lysosomal alkalinization, the basic properties of lysosome
accumulating drugs are important not only for the
lysosomal sequestration itself, but also for alkalinization
of the lysosomal pH, which activates lysosomal biogenesis
[14]. Another possible underlying mechanism to constitute
this lysosomal insult is presumably based on the fact that
a multitude of hydrophobic weak-base drugs contain a
dominant hydrophobic polyaromatic ring structure that can
facilitate their rapid diffusion into cells and their dramatic
intercalation into the lipid core of biomembranes including
the lysosomal membrane. Following this favorable copartition into the lipid-phase of the lysosomal membrane,
these amphiphilic amine compounds undergo a dominant
protonation in the highly acidic lumen (i.e. pH 5.2) of
the lysosomes [37]. As such, this positively charged
amine(s) cannot reside in the lipid bilayer of the lysosomal
membrane and hence must protrude into the hydrophilic
lumen of the lysosomes. Thus, since the typical log P
value of these hydrophobic weak base compounds can,
in some cases, reach values higher than 4 (Table 1), such
a drug that is present at an extracellular concentration of
only 1 μM which is clinically relevant, will favorably
co-partition into the lipid phase of the lysosomal
membrane and reach a concentration of 10 mM while its
protonated amine(s) protrudes into the hydrophilic acidic
lumen of the lysosomes. According to this scenario, these
hydrophobic weak base drugs may act as amphipathic
detergent-like compounds which destabilize the lysosomal
membrane and render it leaky, a phenomenon known as
lysosomal membrane permeabilization [38], thereby
triggering lysosomal biogenesis. In fact, this proposed
model of lysosomal membrane leakage by hydrophobic
weak base drugs has been recently demonstrated for
another hydrophobic weak base compound siramesine,
in cancer cells both in vitro and in vivo [39–41].
Specifically, siramesine, a novel sigma-2 receptor agonist,
induced caspase-independent programmed cell death in
immortalized and transformed cells of various origins.
Moreover, siramesine-treated tumor cells displayed
lysosomal membrane permeabilization, increased levels
of reactive oxygen species, chromatin condensation, as
well as shrinkage and detachment of tumor cells. Moreover,
administration of well-tolerated siramesine doses achieved
a marked antitumor activity in mice harboring orthotopic
breast cancer and sub-cutaneous fibrosarcoma tumors. It
was further shown that siramesine acts as a lysosomotropic
detergent which induces a rapid rise in lysosomal pH that
is followed by lysosomal leakage and dysfunction [40].

Drug Resistance
Figure 7: A schematic summary model for hydrophobic weak base drug-induced lysosome-mediated drug
resistance. Hydrophobic weak base drugs enter the lysosomes by simple diffusion; undergo protonation in the acidic lysosomal lumen,
thereby becoming irreversibly sequestered in lysosomes and acidic intracellular vesicles such as late endosomes. In turn, lysosomal
drug sequestration triggers TFEB-mediated lysosomal biogenesis, resulting in a significant increase in the number of lysosomes per cell.
Increased lysosome number per cell enhances the efficiency of lysosomal drug sequestration, with lysosomes acting as a sink pulling
hydrophobic weak base drugs away from their cellular target sites, thereby resulting in MDR.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

studies identified two distinct binding sites for siramesine
in phospholipid membranes with the highest binding
affinity, measured for phosphatidic acid [42]. Hence, upon
protonation, this amphiphilic amine compound which is
presumably well-embedded via its lipid-soluble aromatic
ring structure in the lipid core of the lysosomal membrane,
ionically interacts with anionic phospholipids hence
resulting in lysosomal membrane permeabilization and
leakage [38]. Taking advantage of this lysosomal membrane
permeabilization, a recent study showed the remarkable
antitumor activity in vitro and in vivo of the combination
of siramesine and vincristine, the latter of which is a
microtubule-destabilizing agent known to induce dramatic
lysosomal alterations, thereby offering a novel combination
cancer therapy [41].
From a cancer therapy perspective, it has been
suggested that lysosomes can serve as a novel emerging
target for anticancer treatment [43] via various approaches
of lysosomal disruption by lysosomotropic agents such as
mefloquine [44], lysosomal photodestruction by lysosome
accumulating photosensitizes such as imidazoacridinones
[25], or induction of lysosome-mediated apoptosis
[45]. Based on the data presented herein we postulate
that cells with a higher lysosome number are likely
to be more resistant to many hydrophobic weak base
chemotherapeutics currently used including mitoxantrone,
doxorubicin, sunitinib and other compounds listed in
Table 1. In the same time, tumor cells which are rich in
lysosomes may exhibit a favorable response to treatment
that targets lysosomes. Thus, targeting lysosomes in
malignant cells may prove a viable and efficacious
strategy to eradicate drug resistant tumor cells. This
hypothesis is strongly supported by recent studies
which targeted lysosomes in cancer cells both in vitro
and in vivo. The group of Jaattella recently showed that
lysosomal membrane permeabilization and subsequent
cell death may prove useful in cancer treatment, provided
that cancer cell lysosomes can be selectively targeted
[46]. In a different study, we have recently reported
that certain imidazoacridinones highly accumulate
in lysosomes and can be used as photosensitizers to
induce an imidazoacridinone-dependent lysosomal
photodestruction, as exposure to light resulted in rapid
photo-rupture of imidazoacridinone-loaded lysosomes
and cell death [25]. In this respect, we have shown that
lysosomal photodestruction of MDR cells reversed the
MDR phenotype, thereby restoring parental cell sensitivity.
Hence, these findings suggest that lysosome-mediated
photodestruction can be used as a pharmacological ‘Trojan
horse’ to overcome drug resistance in cancer cells.
