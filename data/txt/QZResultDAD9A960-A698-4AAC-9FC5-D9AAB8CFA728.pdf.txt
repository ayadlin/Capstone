Abstract

Author Manuscript

Targeted inhibition of Hedgehog signaling at the cell membrane has been associated with anticancer activity in preclinical and early clinical studies. Hedgehog signaling involves activation of
Gli transcription factors that can also be induced by alternative pathways. In this study we
identified an interaction between Gli proteins and a transcription co-activator TAF9, and validated
its functional relevance in regulating Gli transactivation. We also describe a novel, synthetic small
molecule, FN1-8, that efficiently interferes with Gli/TAF9 interaction and down-regulate Gli/

Introduction

Author Manuscript

The Hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway controls multiple fundamental cellular functions,
including cell growth and survival, cell fate determination, body patterning and organ
morphogenesis (1-4). Aberrant Hh pathway activation has been implicated in a variety of
inherited and sporadic malignancies (2). In the quiescent state, the twelve-pass transmembrane Hh receptor Patched-1 (Ptch1) inhibits the activity of the seven-pass transmembrane Hh receptor Smoothened (Smo). Binding of Hh ligands to Ptch1 reverses the
inhibitory effect on Smo. Activated Smo elicits a complex series of cytoplasmic signal
transduction events resulting in activation of the Glioma-associated oncogene (Gli) family of
zinc-finger transcription factors (3). Target genes of Gli dependent transcription include
Gli1, Ptch1, cyclin D1 and Wnt (4-7).

Author Manuscript

The importance of Hh signaling in cancer development has driven a search for modulators
of this pathway, most of which to date has focused on inhibition of Hh signaling at the level
of cell membrane receptors such as Smo (8,9), a key area of focus. Cyclopamine, a natural
plant alkaloid that, along with its derivatives, antagonizes Smo, for example, has been used
widely to inhibit the Hh pathway, and has demonstrated tumor inhibition in both in vitro and
in vivo models (10-14). More recently, Smo inhibitors, such as GDC-0449, have been
reported to have acceptable safety profiles and promising clinical anti-cancer activities in
basal-cell carcinoma (BCC) and medulloblastoma (15-17), strongly suggesting potential
clinical application in the treatment of multiple cancers through the possible suppression of
cancer stem cells. Interestingly, a specific mutation in the Smo gene was recently found to
confer resistance to GDC-0449 in medulloblastoma (18,19). These Smo inhibitors are
currently being tested in Phase I and II clinical trials against different cancer types (20).

Author Manuscript

Increased downstream Hh pathway activation, however, has also been documented in
tumors, and has been attributed to molecular mechanisms including loss of suppressor of
fused (Sufu), Gli gene amplification, and chromosomal translocation (2,6,8,9). Moreover,
emerging evidence has revealed additional mechanisms of Gli activation which are
independent of Hh/Smo regulation, and are stimulated by the cross-talk between
components downstream of Hh/Smo and several other oncogenic signaling pathways, such
as the transforming growth factor β (TGFβ), epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), RAS
and AKT/PI3K pathways (21-30). These findings suggest that Gli proteins may represent
important cancer therapeutic targets. Furthermore, a recent report showed that smallmolecule antagonists of Gli-mediated transcription inhibit prostate cancer cells in vitro and

in vivo (31). In this study, we identified an interaction between Gli and TBP-Associated
Factor 9 (TAF9), and validated the biological relevance of this interaction in regulating Gli
activity. We also designed a small-molecule inhibitor that interferes with the Gli/TAF9
interaction, and down-regulates Gli/TAF9-dependent transcription activity in cell-based
assays. This compound also inhibits cancer cell proliferation in vitro and suppresses tumor
growth in a xenograft model.

Gli1 and Gli2 interact with TAF9 via their conserved transcription activation domain

Author Manuscript

Author Manuscript

A transcription activation domain of Gli has been identified previously at the carboxyterminus with an acidic α-helix containing six aspartate or glutamate residues, highly similar
to the herpes simplex viral protein 16 (VP16) transcription activation domain (32). The αhelical region includes the conserved motif “FXXΦΦ” (F= phenylalanine; X= any residue;
Φ= any hydrophobic residue), and has been described as a putative recognition element for a
transcription co-activator TAF9 (32-34). To examine whether Gli1 and Gli2 directly interact
with TAF9 via their putative TAF9-binding motifs, we first performed an ELISA assay
using purified recombinant His-tagged TAF91-140, a truncated 140-amino acid active TAF9
peptide (35) (Supplementary Figure S1a), and biotinylated Gli1 and Gli2 peptides
containing the putative TAF9 binding motifs (Supplementary Table S1). Biotinylated p53
peptide containing the TAF9 binding motif has been shown to bind TAF9 and was used as a
positive control (33) (Supplementary Table S1 & Figure S1b). We found that TAF91-140
bound to both Gli1 and Gli2 peptides in a dose dependent manner (Figure 1a). No binding
signal was detected, however, when an unrelated protein control His-Fiber (36) was applied.
Moreover, a mutated “FXXΦΦ” motif abolished the binding between Gli peptides and
TAF91-140 (Figure 1a). These results suggest that Gli proteins may specifically interact with
TAF9 protein through their conserved “FXXΦΦ” motif. We next validated the Gli/TAF9
binding by immunoprecipitating endogenous TAF9 in 293T cells transfected with Gli1 or
Gli2 cDNA. Over-expressed Gli1 and Gli2, as well as endogenous Gli1 were readily
observed in the TAF9 co-immunoprecipitates (Figure 1b). In addition, we used an in vitro
transcription/translation system to translate Gli2 and c-myc tagged TAF9 proteins, and
incubated them together with biotinylated oligos containing 5× wild type Gli-binding sites
or 5× mutant Gli-binding sites. Then the complex was pulled down by using anti-c-myc
antibody and spotted onto nylon membrane. The biotinylated oligos were then examined by
using HRP-conjugated streptavidin. The results showed that the TAF9 protein, through
direct binding to Gli2, was able to pull down the wild type Gli-binding sites oligos, but not
the mutant ones (Figure 1c), suggesting the possible importance of Gli/TAF9 binding in Glidependent transcription.
To test the functional significance of Gli and TAF9 binding in human cancer cells, we
investigated the effect of co-transfection of Gli and TAF9 (confirmed by RT-PCR, data not
shown) on Gli-dependent transcription activity and cell proliferation. Co-expression of
TAF9 with either Gli1 or Gli2 in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell line A549
resulted in significantly higher levels of transcription of a Gli-driven luciferase construct
(Gli-Luc) than those induced by Gli1 or Gli2 overexpression alone (p< 0.001; Figure 1d).

On the other hand, knockdown of TAF9 expression by shRNA (confirmed by RT-PCR, data
not shown) in those Gli/TAF9 co-transfected A549 cells significantly down-regulated the
Gli1/TAF9 or Gli2/TAF9 induced Gli-dependent transcription activity (p< 0.001;
Supplementary Figure S1c). The proliferation rate of A549 cells was also significantly
increased by Gli transfection alone and further increased by Gli/TAF9 co-transfection
(p<0.05; Figure 1e).
A small molecule designed to interfere with the Gli/TAF9 interaction

Author Manuscript

We designed a synthetic small molecule known as FN1-8 (Figure 2a) that mimics the αhelical “FXXΦΦ” motif of Gli proteins (37). We first confirmed that FN1-8 (15 uM)
significantly interferes with direct binding of TAF9 to both Gli and Gli2 proteins using
ELISA (p<0.05; Figure 2b) and co-immunoprecipitation (Figure 2c). To examine whether
FN1-8 reduces TAF9/Gli transcription activity, we treated Gli-Luc-transfected A549 cells
transfected either with Gli alone or with TAF9 and Gli for 24 hours with 15 μM FN1-8. We
observed that the Gli-mediated transcription activity induced either by Gli1/Gli2 alone or by
Gli/TAF9 was significantly inhibited by FN1-8 (Figure 2d). While the transcription activity
of Gli alone was reduced by approximately 30%, transcription activity resulting from cotransfection with TAF9 was reduced by about 50% for Gli2 and by about 70% for Gli1. We
also investigated the effect of FN1-8 on the subcellular co-localization of the TAF9 and Gli
proteins in cancer cells by immunofluorescent (IF) staining (Figures 2e and 2f). In control
A549 cells we observed predominant co-localization of both Gli1 and Gli2 with TAF9
within the nucleus, especially around the nuclear membrane, most likely associated with
transcription complexes (38-40). In FN1-8-treated A549 cells, however, this co-localization
pattern was disrupted, with dissociation of both Gli1 and Gli2 from the TAF9, consistent
with our IP and ELISA results.

Author Manuscript

To assess possible non-specific effects of FN1-8, we examined binding of TAF9 and the
subcellular co-localization with p53 by ELISA and IF staining, respectively. We found that
FN1-8 did not interfere with either binding of TAF9 or its co-localization with p53 (Figures
3a and 3b). We also examined p53-dependent transcription activity by measuring 12-repeat
p53 binding site-luciferase reporter activity. After 24-hour treatment at 20 μM, FN1-8 had
no effect on p53-driven luciferase expression (Figure 3c). TAF9 has been shown to bind to
the terminal region of p53, stabilizing p53 and preventing the inhibitory binding of MDM2
to the same domain (33). We therefore examined p53 protein levels and the functional status
of its binding protein MDM2 (phosphorylation form) after FN1-8 treatment. No noticeable
effect was observed at 20 μM FN1-8 compared to the DMSO control (Figure 3d). In
addition, FN1-8 did not affect the activities of several other transcription factors that we
examined, such as Hypoxia inducible factor (HIF), cyclic AMP response element (CRE)binding protein (CREB), and STAT3 (Supplementary Figure S2). Together these results
suggest that FN1-8 specifically interferes with a functional Gli/TAF9 interaction.
FN1-8 inhibits the proliferation of lung cancer cells in vitro
We observed a higher level of Gli1 and Gli2 gene expression in NSCLC tissue samples
compared to that in normal adult lung tissue (Figure 4a). Of 63 NSCLC samples examined,
84.1% showed over-expression of Gli1, 81.0% showed over-expression of Gli2, and 92.1%

had over-expression of at least one of the two Gli genes. Immunohistochemistry (IHC)
staining of these Gli1/2 expressing NSCLC tissue specimens revealed strong nuclear
localization of Gli1 and Gli2 proteins (Figure 4b). Consistently, 8 of the 10 NSCLC cell
lines also over-expressed at least one of the two Gli genes (Figure 4c). These data support
the relevance Gli function as a therapeutic target for NSCLC. We next treated these Gliexpressing NSCLC cell lines with FN1-8 and found that the compound inhibited the
proliferation of NSCLC cells in a dose dependent manner (Figure 5a). We also observed
down-regulation of endogenous Gli-regulated genes, including Ptch1 and Gli1 itself, in these
FN1-8 treated cells (Figure 5b). As a test of specificity of FN1-8 and its inhibitory
mechanism, we examined whether over-expressing Gli and TAF9 proteins could attenuate
the growth suppression effect of FN1-8 (Figure 5c). After treatment of transfected A549
cells with 10 μM FN1-8 for 4-5 days, we noted that over-expression of either Gli2 or TAF9
alone rendered A549 cells more resistant to FN1-8 treatment than empty vector control
(reduction of viable cell number: 38.9% and 41.3% vs 50.6%, respectively). Co-expressing
Gli2 and TAF9 made A549 cells even more resistant than expression of either gene alone
(reduction of viable cell number: 30.5%). These data again suggest that FN1-8 inhibits
NSCLC cell growth via interference with the Gli/TAF9 interaction. Moreover, using a 3Dspheroid model to mimic an in vivo microenvironment, we observed that FN1-8-treated
NSCLC cells formed smaller spheroids (p<0.05) (Figure 5d). The invasive phenotype of
H1299 spheroids, reflected in multiple cellular branch-like structures mimicking the
disruption of basal membrane, was also significantly suppressed by FN1-8 treatment
(p<0.02) (Figure 5d). A BrdU incorporation assay showed that FN1-8 suppresses NSCLC
spheroid proliferation (Figure 5e). In contrast, FN1-8 did not affect the proliferation of
several normal cells that we tested (Supplementary Figure S3).

Author Manuscript

To further examine the specificity of FN1-8 towards endogenous Gli function in cancer, we
compared global gene expressions in NSCLC H1299 cells after treatment with FN1-8, Gli
siRNAs or cyclopamine (Figure 6). We found significant correlations in changes of global
gene expressions between FN1-8 and Gli siRNA treated cells (Figure 6a, r=0.703433),
cyclopamine and Gli siRNA treated cells (Figure 6b, r=0.648474), as well as FN1-8 and
cyclopamine treated cells (Figure 6c, r=0.946167), respectively. Downregulation of several
key effectors of the Hh/Gli pathway in the H1299 cells treated with FN1-8, Gli siRNAs or
cyclopamine was also validated by real-time RT-PCR (Figure 6d). Thus, these data support
that FN1-8 is specific in inhibition of endogenous Gli function in cancer.
FN1-8 inhibits non-canonical Gli activation and acts downstream of the canonical Hh
pathway

Author Manuscript

Our results indicated that FN1-8 directly inhibits Gli function; we therefore hypothesized
that FN1-8 suppresses Gli-dependent transcription activated by alternative pathways other
than the canonical Hh signaling. To test this hypothesis, we stimulated lung cancer A549
cells with recombinant TGFβ protein (Figure 7a). We found that Gli-dependent transcription
activity was significantly increased by TGFβ and that it was downregulated by FN1-8 (10
μM) to a level comparable to that without TGFβ stimulation. TGFβ-induced Gli activation,
on the other hand, was not affected by treatment with cyclopamine (10 μM), a Smo inhibitor
that acts on the canonical Hh signaling (11) (Figure 7a). To further examine the inhibitory

mechanism of FN1-8, we sought to determine how the upstream signaling of the canonical
Hh pathway affected FN1-8. We found that FN1-8 was significantly more effective in
suppressing proliferation of a pancreatic cell line BXPC3 that lacked the Smo expression
(41) than in another pancreatic cell line, CFPAC, that possesses mutant Smo and intact
upstream Shh signaling (41) (Figure 7b). In contrast, cyclopamine had an opposite effect in
these two cell lines (Figure 7b). In another set of experiments, we found that FN1-8 was
significantly more effective than cyclopamine in suppressing proliferation of a melanoma
cell line LOX that lacked the Shh expression (data not shown) (Figure 7c). Addition of
recombinant Shh protein into the treatments of LOX cells resulted in partial rescue of the
FN1-8 treated cells (Figure 7c). Taken together, these results support that FN1-8 acts at the
Gli level downstream of the canonical Hh signaling.
FN1-8 inhibits tumor growth in vivo

To verify the effect of FN1-8 in lung cancer xenografts, we first performed a
pharmacokinetic (PK) study in nude mice (Supplementary Figure S4a) and confirmed the
availability of FN1-8 in those animals. To examine the efficacy of FN1-8, H460 and A549
lung cancer cells were injected subcutaneously into nude mice that were treated either with
vehicle control or with FN1-8 (50 mg/kg) for 12 days. FN1-8 significantly inhibited the
growth of both H460 and A549-derived tumors (Figure 8a, p=0.020 for H460 and p=0.024
for A549) (Figure 8b, p=0.036 for H460 and p=0.045 for A549). No obvious changes in the
body weights of FN1-8 treated mice were observed during the treatment course
(Supplementary Figure S4b). At the completion of the experiment, we analyzed the effect of
FN1-8 on Gli function in the tumors dissected from those xenografts. We found that FN1-8
significantly reduced mRNA expression of Ptch1 and Gli1 in both H460 and A549-derived
tumors (Figure 8c). No noticeable toxicity was observed in organs from FN1-8-treated mice,
and leukocyte populations in those mice were also in the normal ranges (Supplementary
Figures S4c and S4d).

Discussion

Author Manuscript

Abnormal activation of the Hh pathway in cancer may occur through different mechanisms
(2): constitutive activation through loss- or gain-of function mutations of the pathway
receptors (mutation-driven activation), autocrine activation in the same tumor cell or
adjacent ones, and paracrine activation involving the tumor-adjacent stroma (ligand-driven
activation). Although final effectors of canonical Hh signaling regardless of its activation
mechanism, the Gli family of transcription factors can also be activated by other oncogenic
pathways independent of the Hh/Smo regulation (21-30). The complexity of Gli activation
suggests that Gli may be a key control point for cross-talk among these oncogenic pathways
in cancer, and that Gli is a good target for the development of cancer therapeutics.
Indeed, several recent efforts have been made to identify Gli-mediated transcriptional
inhibitors. Inhibitors (31,42-45) have been identified primarily through cell-based screening
assay systems that contain a Gli-dependent luciferase reporter. In this study we report the
identification and validation of the interaction between Gli and TAF9 as a putative
therapeutic target, as well as the design of an inhibitor of the Gli/TAF9 interaction that

suppresses tumor cell growth in vitro and in vivo. TAF9 has been shown to be a major
component of the general transcription factor complex TFIID (38-40). A conserved motif
“FXXΦΦ” has been identified previously within the transcription activation domain of the
Gli proteins and has been described as a putative recognition element for TAF9 (32-34). The
data presented here, however, are the first direct evidence of an interaction between Gli and
TAF9. We demonstrated several ways that TAF9 interacts directly with both Gli1 and Gli2
though the conserved “TAF9-binding” motif. As a control, a mutation in this motif
abolished Gli-TAF9 binding. Nuclear co-localization of both Gli1 and Gli2 with TAF9
protein was also observed. More importantly, the Gli/TAF9 interaction appeared to be
functionally important for Gli-mediated transcriptional activity and for cancer cell
proliferation. Taken together, these data suggest that Gli1 and Gli2 directly interact with
TAF9 in a Gli-dependent transcriptional machinery that is important for cancer cells.

Small molecules targeting the protein-protein interactions of transcription factors have
recently been reported as promising cancer therapeutics (46-48). In order to target the Gli/
TAF9 interaction, we modeled the 3D structure of the conserved motif “FXXΦΦ” of Gli
proteins and observed an α-helix structure (37), consistent with the previous report (32).
Rational chemical design was then employed to design small molecule compounds
comprising a pyrazoline structure to mimic the structure of this motif (37). In this study, we
showed that one of those compounds, FN1-8, was able to specifically disrupt the Gli1/TAF9
and Gli2/TAF9 interactions, and to reduce Gli-mediated transcriptional activity.
Interestingly, FN1-8 disrupted co-localization of both Gli1 and Gli2 with TAF9 within the
nucleus of cancer cells, suggesting that binding to TAF9 within the transcriptional complex
may be important for Gli1 and Gli2 nuclear localization. Because TAF9 has been shown to
bind to the terminal region of p53 and stabilize p53 function (33), we examined whether
FN1-8 interferes with the p53/TAF9 interaction and p53 function as a specificity control.
We found that FN1-8 did not interfere with the binding of and co-localization between
TAF9 and p53, or with p53-dependent transcription activity. The p53-TAF9 binding motif
may therefore have a 3D conformation different from that of the Gli proteins; alternatively,
the binding affinity between TAF9 and p53 may be higher than that between TAF9 and Gli.
Together with our results that transcriptional activity of several other transcription factors
was not affected by FN1-8 treatment, it seems that FN1-8 is a relatively specific antagonist
for the functional Gli/TAF9 interaction.

Author Manuscript

In addition to our observation that FN1-8 significantly suppresses canonical Hh/Gli target
gene expression as well as the proliferation of lung cancer cells in vitro and in vivo, we also
demonstrated that FN1-8 suppresses TGFβ-induced Gli activation and inhibits cancer cell
proliferation without upstream canonical Hh/Smo signaling in vitro. In contrast,
cyclopamine, a Smo inhibitor, had no effect on non-canonical Gli activation and was less
potent in growth inhibition of cancer cells lacking upstream canonical Hh/Smo signaling.
These data support our hypothesis that Gli function may be a better therapeutic target
because of its putative critical role as a control point for multiple oncogenic pathways in
cancer. Furthermore, FN1-8 was found to inhibit proliferation of a number of disparate
cancer cells that expressed Gli proteins other than lung cancer, including prostate cancer,
pancreatic cancer, colon cancer and glioma (data not shown), consistent with previous
reports of downstream activation of Hh pathway effectors in those cancer types (8-14). Our

results indicate that targeting Gli function may have broader implications for the clinical

NSCLC cell line H1299 was treated with 10μM FN1-8 or 10μM cyclopamine for 48 hours.
For siRNA treatment, cells were transfected simultaneously with Gli1 and Gli2 siRNAs
(total 5ng) for 72 hours. Total RNA of the treated cells was then extracted using Qiagen
RNeasy Mini Kit. 250 ng of total RNA was amplified into cRNA and made into cDNA
using the Ambion WT Expression Kit. 5.5 ug of the cDNA was then fragmented using the
Affymetrix GeneChip WT Terminal Labeling kit and confirmed by running on the Agilent
Bioanalyzer using the RNA 6000 kit. The fragmented cDNA was labeled using the
Affymetrix GeneChip WT Terminal Labeling kit and added into the hybridization cocktail
that was prepared according to the protocol included in the Affymetrix GeneTitan
Hybridization Wash and Stain kit. The samples were finally loaded into the Affymetrix
GeneTitan MC at the UCSF Thoracic Oncology Laboratory for hybridization, washing, and
scanning. Raw signal intensities were extracted with Agilent Feature Extraction software.
mRNA expression profiles from compounds and siRNAs treated cells were compared with
control cells to get gene expression changes. The expression changes by FN1-8,
cyclopamine, and Gli siRNAs were compared in pairs to evaluate the correlation.

All experiments were performed at the UCSF Preclinical Core in accordance with UCSF
institutional guidelines. For pharmacokinetic study, mice (3/group) were i.p. injected in the
abdomens with compound FN1-8 (30mg/kg body weight). Then plasma was collected from
the tail-vein of each mouse at 10 min, 2 hours, 6 hours and 24 hours after injection. The
FN1-8 concentration in each plasma sample was determined by mass spec. For efficacy
study, ten mice (female athymic nude mice NCRNU-M (Taconic)) were used in each group
and injected s.c. with 3×106/100μl human cancer cells in the dorsal area. Tumors were
allowed to grow for 7 days after inoculation to become visible nodules. Animals were then
i.p. injected with compound FN1-8 (50mg/kg body weight) or vehicle control daily around
the same time for 12 days. Tumors were allowed to grow for an additional week after
completion of the treatments. Tumor size was measured and tumor volumes were calculated
using width (x) and length (y) (x2y/2, where x < y). For toxicity analysis, body weights of
the treated mice were monitored throughout the dosing period. Organs were also resected
from mice at completion of the efficacy study. The specimens were fixed in 4% buffered
formaldehyde, embedded in paraffin, sectioned, and histologically analyzed by hematoxylin
and eosin (HE) staining. The HE stained slides were then examined by a mouse pathologist
for toxicity evidence. Additionally, leukocytes from each animal were collected and
leukocyte population was counted through a blood cell counter. Data was presented as mean
values (± S.D.).

Statistical analysis
All data were calculated as means ± standard deviations. Differences between groups were
compared with a two-sided student's t-test. A p value of 0.05 or less was considered to be
significant.
