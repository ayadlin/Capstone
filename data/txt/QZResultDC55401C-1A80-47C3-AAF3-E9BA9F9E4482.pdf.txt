responses in NAFLD-promoted HCC is largely unknown. Here, we show that dysregulation of
lipid metabolism in NAFLD causes a selective loss of intrahepatic CD4+ but not CD8+ T
lymphocytes leading to accelerated hepatocarcinogenesis. We also found that CD4+ T
lymphocytes have greater mitochondrial mass than CD8+ T lymphocytes and generate higher
levels of mitochondrially-derived reactive oxygen species (ROS). Disruption of mitochondrial
function by linoleic acid, a fatty acid accumulated in NAFLD, causes more oxidative damage than
other free fatty acids such as palmitic acid, and mediates selective loss of intrahepatic CD4+ T
lymphocytes. In vivo blockade of ROS reversed NAFLD-induced hepatic CD4+ T lymphocyte
decrease and delayed NAFLD-promoted HCC. Our results provide an unexpected link between
lipid dysregulation and impaired anti-tumor surveillance.

HCC commonly arises in patients with underlying chronic liver disease, and is considered a
1
typical inflammation-associated tumor . Recent epidemiology studies indicate an increase
25
in the rate of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD)-induced HCC - . Immune evasion
mediated by numerous immune suppressor mechanisms involving different immune cell
6
subsets have been shown to contribute to HCC initiation and progression , and patients with
tumors containing lymphocytic infiltrates show longer survival and lower risk of
7
recurrence . However, the role of adaptive immune responses in NAFLD and HCC have just
8
begun to be understood .

Here we investigated how metabolic changes observed in NAFLD promoted
hepatocarcinogenesis using a series of different murine NAFLD and HCC models and
confirmed our results using human samples. Inducible liver-specific MYC oncogene
9
transgenic mice were fed with methionine choline-deficient diet (MCD) to induce
10
NAFLD (Fig. 1a, Extended Data Fig. 1a and b). Earlier microscopic liver tumor lesions
were found in MYC-ON MCD mice (Fig. 1b upper panel). As expected, MYC-ON MCD
mice showed more macroscopic liver tumors (Fig. 1b lower panel and c). Similar results
were obtained in MYC mice fed choline-deficient and amino acid-defined diet (CDAA),
11
another NAFLD diet (Extended Data Fig. 1c-e) . Again, more liver tumors were found in
12 13
carcinogen diethylnitrosamine-challenged C57BL/6 mice , fed with CDAA or HF diet
(Extended Data Fig. 1f-i). These results clearly demonstrate that diet-induced NAFLD
enhances HCC in different murine hepatocarcinogenesis and NAFLD models.

Next, we studied the immune cell subsets in mice with NAFLD and HCC. Consistent with
previous reports, dendritic cells, macrophages and CD11b+Gr1+ cells increased (Extended
14 16
Data Fig. 2a,b) - . Unexpectedly, significantly fewer CD3hiCD4+ T lymphocytes, which
corresponded to conventional intrahepatic CD4+ T lymphocytes, were found in mice with
NAFLD (Fig. 1d and Extended Data Fig. 2a-c, e). No significant difference of intrahepatic
CD3loCD4+ cells representing NKT cells (Extended Data Fig. 2d, f) or splenic CD4+ T
lymphocytes was observed (Extended Data Fig. 2g). Unlike CD4+ T lymphocytes,
intrahepatic CD8+ T lymphocytes remained unchanged (Fig. 1e, Extended Data Fig. 2a, b).
The liver-specific reduction of CD4+ but not CD8+ T lymphocytes was also observed in the
two other dietary NAFLD models in both tumor-free and tumor-bearing settings (Extended
Data Fig. 2h-t), illustrating a tumor-independent but NAFLD-dependent mechanism. In

addition, fewer CD4+ but not CD8+ T lymphocytes were found in leptin-deficient (ob/ob)
mice (Extended Data Fig. 2u-x).

Author Manuscript

CD4+ T lymphocytes in NAFLD mice were characterized. Higher levels of CD69 and
CD44hiCD62lo subset were found in MYC-ON MCD mice (Extended Data Fig. 3a-d).
Hepatic but not splenic CD4+ T lymphocytes also consistently produced more IFNγ but not
IL-4 (Extended Data Fig. 3e-g). Although T-bet, GATA3 and Foxp3 frequency did not
change, more RORγt was detected in MYC-ON MCD mice (Extended Data Fig.3 h).
Accordingly, intrahepatic CD4+ T lymphocytes produced more IL17 in NAFLD (Extended
Data Fig.3i, j). No change of regulatory T lymphocyte (Treg) frequency was found, and
17
absolute numbers decreased (Extended Data Fig.3h, k), consistent with a previous report .
In addition, the Treg function remained unchanged in NAFLD (Extended Data Fig.3l).
Together, our results indicate that NAFLD caused activation of hepatic CD4+ T lymphocytes
in mice.

CD4+ T lymphocytes have been reported to inhibit HCC initiation and mediate tumor
18 19
regression , . It has also been reported that a considerable fraction of non-synonymous
cancer mutations is immunogenic and that the majority of the immunogenic mutanome is
20
recognized by CD4+ T lymphocytes . Therefore, we studied tumor-specific CD4+ T
lymphocytes. AFP-specific CD4+ T lymphocytes in MYC-ON MCD mice were detected,
suggesting that MYC tumors induced anti-tumor CD4+ T lymphocyte responses (Extended
Data Fig. 3m). Next, we depleted CD4+ T lymphocytes to study their relevance on tumor
growth. CD4 antibody depletion (Extended Data Fig. 3n) caused more hepatic tumor lesions
in MYC-ON MCD mice (Fig. 2a-c). In control diet-fed MYC mice CD4 antibody depletion
also promoted tumors but at a later time point (Extended Data Fig. 3o, p). These results
suggested that loss of CD4+ T lymphocytes strongly contributed to HCC development in
MYC mice.

Next, we studied CD4+ T lymphocyte survival in mice with NAFLD, and higher Annexin
V+ level was found (Fig. 3a, Extended Data Fig. 4a). We hypothesized that the extensive
hepatic lipid accumulation induced the CD4+ T lymphocyte loss. Hepatocytes isolated from
MCD mice, which showed accumulation of lipid droplets (Extended Data Fig. 4b), or
control mice were co-cultured with splenocytes. Interestingly, a significant increase in
Annexin V+7AAD+ cells was seen in CD4+ but not CD8+ T lymphocytes (Extended Data
Fig. 4c-e). No cell-to-cell contact was required (Fig. 3b). Higher lipid levels were detected in
hepatic CD4+ T lymphocytes in MCD mice (Extended Data Fig. 4f, g). This prompted us to
examine whether lipids released from lipid-laden hepatocytes were taken up by CD4+ T
lymphocytes and caused cell death. To test this hypothesis, we first measured the hepatic
FFA composition. Consistent with previous reports, palmitic acid (C16:0), stearic acid
(C18:0), linoleic acid (C18:2), arachidonic acid (C20:4) and docosahexaenoic acid (C22:6)
are the abundant FFAs (Fig. 3c, Extended Data Table 1). Although the total amount of FFAs
did not change significantly (Extended Data Table 1), the levels of C16:0 and C22:6
decreased. C18:2 was the only abundant FFA, which accumulated in the liver after MCD
treatment (Fig. 3c). Our data is supported by previous reports of hepatic C18:2 accumulation
8 21
in HF diet-induced NAFLD mice and ob/ob mice , . Next, we depleted FFAs from
conditioned hepatocyte-culture medium. As expected FFA-depleted conditioned medium no

longer caused CD4+ T lymphocyte death (Fig. 3d). FFAs in conditioned medium from lipidladen hepatocytes were further analyzed, and C16:0, C18:0 and C18:2 were identified as
predominant FFAs. (Extended Data Fig. 4h, i).

Author Manuscript

Then, isolated CD4+ T lymphocytes were incubated with individual FFA to study their effect
on cell survival. C18:2 treatment caused a substantial higher level of 7AAD+Annexin V+
cells. Other tested FFAs did not show an effect (Fig. 3e). Unlike CD4+ T lymphocytes, cell
death in CD8+ T lymphocytes was not affected at the tested concentration (Fig. 3f). Similar
results were found in activated T lymphocytes (Extended Data Fig. 4j). Dose-response and
time course analysis confirmed that CD4+ T lymphocytes were more susceptible to C18:2induced cell death than CD8+ T lymphocytes (Extended Data Fig. 4k-m). The increase of
caspase 3/7 activity confirmed that CD4+ T lymphocytes died via apoptosis (Extended Data
Fig. 4n). Similar cell death between CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes was observed in H2O2induced cell death model showing that the effect is specific to C18:2 (Extended Data Fig.
4o). Interestingly, mice fed with a high C18:2 diet showed a reduction in CD4+ but not
CD8+ T lymphocytes (Fig. 3g, h) suggesting that C18:2 is sufficient to cause CD4+ T
lymphocyte death in vivo.

The mechanism of how C18:2 induced CD4+ T lymphocyte death was studied. No
difference in cellular C18:2 uptake by CD4+ versus CD8+ T lymphocytes was found
(Extended Data Fig. 4p). Direct assessment revealed greater mitochondrial mass in CD4+
lymphocytes (Fig. 4a). Microarray analysis revealed that oxidative phosphorylation and
mitochondrial dysfunction pathways were specifically altered in CD4+ but not CD8+ T
lymphocytes following C18:2 treatment (Extended Data Fig. 5). CPT1a, the rate-limiting
enzyme for importing FFAs into mitochondria, increased in parallel with the decrease of a
number of genes coding components for electron transport complex (Extended Data Fig. 6a).
C18:2 was more potent than other FFAs in upregulating CPT1a (Fig. 4b). A similar effect
was observed in Jurkat cells, a human CD4+ derived T leukemia cell line (Extended Data
Fig. 6b). Knockdown of CPT1a rescued Jurkat cells from C18:2-induced cell death (Fig.4c,
Extended Data Fig. 6c). All these results pointed towards mitochondria as the critical
mediator for CD4+ T lymphocyte death. Inside mitochondria, FFAs are β-oxidized to fuel
ATP generation via electron transport chain (ETC). Fatty acid oxidation (FAO) was
measured, and C18:2 showed a greater FAO rate than C16:0 (Fig. 4d). Higher FAO favors
more NADH entering the ETC to generate ATP. However, our array data also suggested that
C18:2 impaired ETC function (Extended Data Fig. 6a). Indeed, mitochondrial membrane
potential, which is maintained by proper ETC activity, was significantly decreased by C18:2
in CD4+ but not CD8+ T lymphocytes (Fig. 4e). Disrupted ETC can become a major site of
premature electron leakage to oxygen to generate reactive oxygen species (ROS) and lead to
22
cell death .
To assess mitochondrial respiration, oxygen consumption analysis was performed.
Normalized oxygen consumption rates (OCR) were significantly higher in CD4+ T
23
lymphocytes compared to CD8+ T lymphocytes, consistent with previous reports .
Treatment with oligomycin, an inhibitor of mitochondrial ATP synthase, revealed substantial
levels of ATP synthase-dependent oxygen consumption in both CD4+ and CD8+ T
lymphocytes (Figure 4f, Extended Figure 6d). C18:2 abrogated the oligomycin-sensitive

fraction of OCR in CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes without reducing total oxygen
consumption levels (Figure 4f, Extended Figure 6d). These data are consistent with a shift in
oxygen consumption from ATP synthase dependent to ATP synthase independent ROS
production. In contrast, C16:0 failed to eliminate ATP synthase dependent oxygen
consumption in CD4+ T lymphocytes (Figure 4g, Extended 6e). Consistently, increased total
ROS production was found in CD4+ T lymphocytes when co-cultured with C18:2 vs C16:0
(Extended Data Fig. 6f). Moreover, elevated ROS levels were detected in hepatic CD4+ T
lymphocytes ex vivo under NAFLD condition (Fig. 4h) Lastly, mitochondrial superoxide
was confirmed to selectively increase in CD4+ T lymphocytes after C18:2 treatment (Fig.
4i), and CPT1a knockdown blocked C18:2-induced mitochondrial ROS production
(Extended Data Fig. 6g). Taken together, these data suggest that greater levels of
mitochondrial-derived ROS accumulate in CD4+ T lymphocytes following C18:2 treatment
leading to their depletion.

Therefore, we tested the role of ROS in NAFLD-associated CD4+ T lymphocyte death and
HCC development in vivo. Blocking ROS with catalase or N-acetylcysteine (NAC)
abrogated cell death in vitro in CD4+ T lymphocytes when incubated with hepatocytes from
MCD-MYC mice (Fig. 4j). Similarly, catalase and NAC prevented C18:2-induced CD4+ T
lymphocyte death in vitro (Extended Data Fig. 6h). Oxidative stress is an important factor in
24
NAFLD progression . To test whether ROS mediate hepatic CD4+ T lymphocyte loss in
vivo, we treated MCD diet-fed mice with NAC. Although NAC treatment did not influence
steatosis (Extended Data Fig. 6i, j), it effectively reversed the loss of hepatic CD4+ T
lymphocytes (Fig. 4k). More importantly, NAC treatment significantly delayed NASHpromoted tumor development (Fig. 4l and Extended Data Fig. 6j). Tumor lesions occurred
despite NAC treatment when CD4+ T lymphocytes were removed, suggesting prevention of
CD4+ T lymphocyte death mediates at least partially the anti-tumor effect of NAC. Similar
25
results were obtained using mitoTEMPO , a specific mitochondrial antioxidant in both in
vitro and in vivo settings (Fig. 4m-o).

C18:2 has also been identified as an important fatty acid in the context of NAFLD in
26 27
humans , . We tested whether C18:2 also affects human CD4+ T lymphocyte survival.
Consistent with our mouse data, C18:2, but no other tested FFAs, caused selective CD4+ but
not CD8+ T lymphocyte death (Fig. 4p, Extended Data Fig. 7a). Similarly, C18:2 but not
C16:0 increased ROS level in human CD4+ T lymphocytes (Extended Data Fig. 7b). Finally,
intrahepatic CD4+ T lymphocytes in liver biopsies from patients with NASH, alcoholic
steatohepatitis (ASH) and viral hepatitis were determined (Extended Data Table 2). While
ALT and AST levels did not differ among patients with different liver diseases (Extended
Data Fig.7c, d), fewer CD4+ T lymphocytes were found in NASH and ASH patients than
viral hepatitis patients (Extended Data Fig. 7e and Extended Data Fig. 8), and the CD4/CD8
ratio was significantly lower in NASH patients supporting the selective CD4+ T lymphocyte
loss (Fig. 4q). Interestingly, lower CD4 counts were also found in ASH patients, which has
very similar histological features compared with NASH.
Dysregulation of lipid metabolism and accumulation of lipids in the liver is part of the
etiology of NAFLD. So far NASH has been described as causing NFκB dysregulation,
activation of the inflammasome, TLR activation and affecting innate immune responses

through multiple pathways or directly affecting hepatocytes - . Our results extend these
findings by describing a novel link between obesity-induced lipid accumulation and
selective CD4+ T lymphocyte loss, suggest a critical role for CD4+ T lymphocytes in the
disease progression from NAFLD to HCC.

LAP-tTA and TRE-MYC mice were previously described and MYC expression in the liver
was activated by removing doxycycline treatment (100 μg/ml) from the drinking water of 4weeks old double transgenic mice for both TRE-MYC and LAP-tTA as previously
9 13
described , . C57BL/6 mice were obtained from NCI/Frederick (Frederick, USA).
Chemically induced HCC was established by intraperitoneal injection of
diethylnitrosoamine (DEN) (Sigma) into two-week old male pups at a dose of 20 μg/g
13
bodyweight . Twelve-week old male B6.Cg-Lepob/J (ob/ob) mice or wild type control
31
mice were obtained from Charles River. Foxp3-GFP mice were previously described .
NAFLD was induced by feeding mice with methionine choline-deficient (MCD) diet (Cat#
960439, MP biomedical, USA), choline-deficient and amino acid-defined (CDAA) diet
(Cat# 518753, Dyets, USA) or high fat diet (Cat# F3282, Bio Serv, USA) for the indicated
10 11 32
time , , . The MCD diet was supplied with corn oil (10%, w/w), and no fish oil was
added. Control diet was purchased from MP Biomedical (Cat#960441). Custom-made high
or low linoleic acid mouse diets were purchased from Research Diets, Inc. The modified
diets were based on AIN-76A standard mouse diet, and are isocaloric (4.45kcal/g) and
contained same high-fat content (23%, w/w). Linoleic acid-rich safflower oil and saturated
fatty acid-containing coconut oil were supplied at different ratio to yield 2% (w/w) for low
linoleic acid diet or 12% (w/w) for high linoleic acid diet. C57BL/6 mice were fed with high
or low linoleic acid diet for 4 weeks. MYC mice were injected i.p. with 50μg CD4 antibody
(clone GK1.5, BioXcell) every week for the indicated time period to deplete CD4+ T
33
34
cells . N-acetylcysteine (NAC) was given in drinking water (10 mg/ml) for the indicated
time period to prevent excess ROS production. Mitochondrial specific antioxidant
mitoTEMPO was purchased from Sigma. Mice received mitoTEMPO at a dose of 0.7 mg/kg
25
per day by osmotic minipumps (ALZET). At the experimental end points, mice were
sacrificed. For flow cytometry analysis, single cell suspensions were prepared from spleen,
liver and blood as described previously. Red blood cells were lysed by ACK Lysis Buffer

complete RPMI medium and have been tested to be mycoplasma free. Jurkat cells were
infected with shRNA lentivirus. Puromycin was added to eliminate non-transduced cells.
Doxycycline (100 ng/ml) was added to induce shRNA and GFP expression for 3 days.
Efficiency of shRNAs was confirmed by Western. Jurkat cells with CPT1a knockdown were
treated with 200 µM linoleic acid for 24 hrs. Mitochondrial ROS production and cell
survival were measured in GFP+-transduced cells.
Fatty acid oxidation assay
37

Author Manuscript

Fatty acid oxidation was measured according to previous publication . 1-14C-linoleic acid
and 1-14C-palmitic acid were purchased from PerkinElmer. Briefly, isolated CD4+ or CD8+
T lymphocytes were pretreated with linoleic acid or kept in regular media. After 24 hrs. cell
media was changed to media containing 50 μM cold linoleic acid plus 1μCi 1-14C-linoleic
acid/ml or 50 μM cold palmitic acid plus 1μCi 1-14C-palmitic acid /ml. After 2 hours
medium was removed and mixed with concentrated perchloric acid (final concentration
0.3M) plus BSA (final concentration 2%) to precipitate the radiolabeled fatty acids. Samples
were vortexed and centrifuged (10,000x g for 10 min). Radioactivity was determined in the
supernatant to measure water-soluble β-oxidation products.
Mitochondrial membrane potential and ROS staining
Mitochondrial membrane potential was measured by TMRM (immunochemistry
technologies) staining according to manufacturer’s protocol. Briefly, cells were kept in

culture medium with 100 nM of TMRM for 20 minutes in CO2 incubator at 37°C. After
washing twice, cells were processed to flow cytometry analysis. Mitochondria associated
superoxide was detected by mitoSOX (life technologies) staining according to
manufacturer’s protocol. Briefly cells were first subjected to surface marker staining. Then
cells were stained with 2.5 μM mitoSOX for 30 minutes in CO2 incubator at 37°C. After
washing twice, cells were processed for flow cytometry analysis.
Oxygen consumption assay

Author Manuscript

OCR was measured using an XFe96 Extracellular Flux Analyzer (Seahorse Bioscience) as
38
previously published . AutoMACS sorted mouse CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes were
attached to XFe96 cell culture plates using Cell-Tak (BD Bioscience) in RPMI media with
11 mM glucose. Cells were activated with 1:1 CD3:CD28 beads (Miltenyi BioTech) and
vehicle vs 50 µM linoleic acid was added. Twenty-four hours after activation, cells were
incubated in serum-free XF Base Media (Seahorse Bioscience) supplemented with 10 mM
glucose, 2 mM pyruvate, and 2 µM glutamine, pH 7.4, along with 50 µM linoleic acid if
previously present, for 30 minutes at 37°C in a CO2-free cell culture incubator before
beginning the assay. Five consecutive measurements, each representing the mean of 8 wells,
were obtained at baseline and following sequential addition of 1.25 µM oligomycin, 0.25 µM
trifluorocarbonylcyanide phenylhydrazone (FCCP), and 1 µM each of rotenone and
antimycin A (all drugs from Seahorse Bioscience). OCR values were normalized to cell
number as measured by the CyQUANT Cell Proliferation Assay Kit (Life Technologies).
Human studies
8

Author Manuscript

Human liver samples were stained as previously described . For immuno staining, formalinfixed, paraffin-embedded human liver tissue samples were retrieved from the archives of the
Institute of Surgical Pathology, University Hospital Zurich. The study was approved by the
local ethics committee (“Kantonale Ethikkommission Zürich”, application number KEKZH-Nr. 2013-0382). Human PBMC from healthy donors were obtained on an NIH approved
39
protocol and prepared as described previously . Informed consent was obtained from all
subjects.
Statistic analysis

Author Manuscript

Sample size for animal studies were guided by previous study in our laboratory in which the
same MYC transgenic mouse stain was used. No animals were excluded. Neither
randomization nor blinding was done during the in vivo study. However, mice from same
littermates were evenly distributed into control or treatment groups whenever possible.
Sample size for the patient studies was guided by a recent publication also studying NASH
8
induced HCC, but focused on different aspects . Statistical analysis was performed with
GraphPad Prism 6 (GraphPad Software). Significance of the difference between groups was
calculated by Student’s unpaired t-test, one-way or two-way ANOVA (Tukey’s and
Bonferroni’s multiple comparison test). Welch’s corrections were used when variances
between groups were unequal. p<0.05 was considered as statistically significant.
