Abstract

Introduction

Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most lethal of brain
tumors and is highly resistant to ionizing radiation (IR) and
chemotherapy. Here, we report on a molecular mechanism by
which a key glioma-specific mutation, epidermal growth factor
receptor variant III (EGFRvIII), confers radiation resistance.
Using Ink4a/Arf-deficient primary mouse astrocytes, primary
astrocytes immortalized by p53/Rb suppression, as well as
human U87 glioma cells, we show that EGFRvIII expression
enhances clonogenic survival following IR. This enhanced radioresistance is due to accelerated repair of DNA doublestrand breaks (DSB), the most lethal lesion inflicted by IR. The
EGFR inhibitor gefitinib (Iressa) and the phosphatidylinositol
3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitor LY294002 attenuate the rate of DSB
repair. Importantly, expression of constitutively active, myristylated Akt-1 accelerates repair, implicating the PI3K/Akt-1
pathway in radioresistance. Most notably, EGFRvIII-expressing
U87 glioma cells show elevated activation of a key DSB repair enzyme, DNA-dependent protein kinase catalytic subunit (DNA-PKcs). Enhanced radioresistance is abrogated by
the DNA-PKcs–specific inhibitor NU7026, and EGFRvIII fails
to confer radioresistance in DNA-PKcs–deficient cells. In vivo,
orthotopic U87-EGFRvIII–derived tumors display faster rates
of DSB repair following whole-brain radiotherapy compared
with U87-derived tumors. Consequently, EGFRvIII-expressing
tumors are radioresistant and continue to grow following
whole-brain radiotherapy with little effect on overall survival.
These in vitro and in vivo data support our hypothesis that
EGFRvIII expression promotes DNA-PKcs activation and DSB
repair, perhaps as a consequence of hyperactivated PI3K/
Akt-1 signaling. Taken together, our results raise the possibility
that EGFR and/or DNA-PKcs inhibition concurrent with radiation may be an effective therapeutic strategy for radiosensitizing high-grade gliomas. [Cancer Res 2009;69(10):4252–9]

Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most aggressive form of
brain tumors with extremely poor prognosis (1). Effective treatment of GBM is complicated by the diffuse infiltrative nature of the
disease and extreme radioresistance of these tumors. However, a
clear survival advantage of post-resection radiation has been established by randomized trials, showing that the median survival of
GBM patients was improved, from f6 months to 10 to 12 months,
following near-maximal brain-tolerated doses of ionizing radiation
(IR; 50–60 Gy). The central role that radiation plays in treating GBM
is also illustrated by the landmark Stupp study (2) showing that
concurrent radiation and temozolomide, an alkylating agent, can
further increase median survival from 12.1 to 14.6 months. It is clear
that an improved molecular understanding of GBM radioresistance
is needed for the development of rational, tumor-selective radiosensitizing drugs.
As a first step toward understanding the genetic basis of GBM
radioresistance, we focused on epidermal growth factor receptor
variant III (EGFRvIII), the most commonly amplified/mutated gene
in GBMs (1, 3, 4). Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is a
transmembrane receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) whose ligands
include epidermal growth factor and transforming growth factor a
(5, 6). The EGFR gene is amplified in f50% of GBMs, and of these,
about half express a truncated version of the receptor, EGFRvIII
(1, 3, 4). Although EGFRvIII lacks the ligand-binding domain (7), it
is constitutively active (8), stimulating downstream signaling
effectors that include phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), Akt-1,
Ras, and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK). Several studies
have shown that EGFRvIII promotes malignant growth (9) and is
associated with poor prognosis (10, 11).
Previous in vitro studies using established glioma cell lines have
shown that EGFRvIII confers resistance to IR (12–14). Xenograft
studies have shown that EGFR-specific inhibitors (small-molecule
as well as a-EGFR antibodies) significantly enhance the efficacy of
radiotherapy (15, 16). However, the signaling pathways directly
involved in EGFRvIII-mediated radiation resistance have not been
completely elucidated. We report here that EGFRvIII expression
enhances radioresistance in tumor suppressor–deficient primary
mouse astrocytes and in U87 human glioma cell lines by promoting
the rapid repair of radiation-induced DNA double-strand breaks
(DSB). Proficient DSB repair is facilitated by hyperactivation of
the DSB repair enzyme, DNA-dependent protein kinase catalytic
subunit (DNA-PKcs; refs. 17, 18). We extend these in vitro
mechanistic studies to an orthotopic model and show that,
following whole-brain radiotherapy, intracranial U87-EGFRvIII
tumors show proficient DSB repair compared with U87 parental

tumors. The possible clinical effect of hyperactivating such DSB
repair pathways due to EGFRvIII expression was assessed by
Kaplan-Meier survival analysis. Nude mice bearing U87-EGFRvIII
intracranial tumors receiving whole-brain radiotherapy showed no
evidence of improved survival, whereas mice bearing U87 parental
tumors showed a remarkable increase in survival following
radiation. Taken together, our results suggest that DNA-PKcs
inhibitors and/or EGFR inhibitors administered concurrently with
radiation may be an effective therapeutic strategy for radiosensitizing these recalcitrant tumors.

Materials and Methods
Isolation of primary astrocytes. Primary astrocytes were isolated from
5-d-old wild-type or Ink4a/Arf / pups as described previously (19).
Primary wild-type astrocytes were immortalized by retroviral expression of
the SV40-large T antigen (SV40-LT). Plasmid construction, virus production,
and infection protocols have previously been described in detail (20).
Transfection of astrocytes with retroviruses expressing mutant, constitutively active EGFR (EGFRvIII), wild-type EGFR (EGFRwt), or kinase-dead
EGFR (EGFRkd) was carried out as described (19).
Cell culture. Mouse astrocytes, mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF), and
human U87 glioma lines were all maintained in a-MEM containing 10%
fetal bovine serum (FBS) in a humidified 37jC incubator in the presence of
5% CO2.
Drug treatments. For drug treatments, DNA-PKcs inhibitor [10 Amol/L
NU7026 (Calbiochem)], EGFR inhibitor [5 Amol/L gefitinib (Iressa;
Astrazeneca Co.)], or PI3K inhibitor [50 Amol/L LY294002 (Sigma)] was
added to cells (Ink4a/Arf / cohort, SV40-LT cohort, or U87 cohort)
1 h before irradiation. Control cells were treated with DMSO.
Irradiation of cells and animals. For g-ray irradiation of cells (Ink4a/
Arf / cohort, SV40-LT cohort, U87 cohort, or MEFs), a 137Cs source (JL
Shepherd and Associates) was used. Midbrains of mice were irradiated with
an X-ray device (Pantak, 300 kV, 12 mA, 1.65 mm Al) fitted with a specifically
designed collimator providing a 1-cm-diameter field size iso-dose exposure.
Colony formation assays. Three hundred cells (Ink4a/Arf / cohort,
SV40-LT cohort, U87 cohort, or MEFs) were plated in triplicate under
reduced serum (0.5% FBS) conditions. Cells were irradiated at different
doses (0–8 Gy) after allowing recovery for 4 h. Medium containing 10%
serum was added back 24 h later. Colonies were allowed to form for f8 d.
Cells were then fixed and stained with crystal violet. Colonies with >50
cells were scored, and mean values for triplicate counts determined as
described (21).
DSB repair assay. DSB repair rates were assessed by quantifying the
rates of dissolution of 53BP1 foci as described (22). Approximately 4  104
cells (Ink4a/Arf / cohort, SV40-LT cohort, or U87 cohort) were seeded
overnight in glass chamber slides under reduced serum (0.5% FBS)
conditions. The following day, cells were irradiated with a total dose of
1 Gy, fixed at the indicated times, and immunostained with a-53BP1 primary
antibody (Cell Signaling) and FITC-conjugated goat anti-rabbit secondary
antibody (Molecular Probes) as described (22). The number of 53BP1 foci
was determined for each time (average of 100 nuclei), and after subtracting
background (number of foci in unirradiated population), the percentage foci
remaining was plotted against time to obtain DSB repair kinetics.
Western blotting. To detect EGFR, EGFRvIII, Akt-1, and phosphoAkt-1,
whole-cell extracts were prepared from cells (Ink4a/Arf / cohort, SV40-LT
cohort, U87 cohort, or MEFs) grown overnight in medium containing
reduced serum (0.5%) as described (19), separated by 8% PAGE, blotted onto
nitrocellulose, and probed with a-EGFR (Santa Cruz), a-phosphoAkt1(Ser473; Cell Signaling), and a-Akt-1 (Cell Signaling). For detection of DNAPKcs and phospho-DNA-PKcs (in mock-irradiated or g-irradiated U87 cells),
nuclear extracts were prepared as described (23), separated by 8% PAGE
(low BIS), blotted onto nitrocellulose, and probed with a-DNA-PKcs
(Neomarkers), a-phosphoDNA-PKcs(T2647) (kind gift from Dr. Benjamin
Chen, Department of Radiation Oncology, University of Texas Southwestern
Medical Center at Dallas, Dallas, TX), and a-actin (Sigma) antibodies.

Stereotactic injection of cell lines. Orthotopic tumors were generated
as described (9, 19). U87 parental or U87-EGFRvIII cells were infected with a
puromycin-selectable retrovirus expressing luciferase. Equivalent levels of
luciferase expression in the two cell lines were verified by Western blotting
with an a-luciferase antibody (Sigma). For intracerebral stereotactic
inoculation, 5  105 cells were suspended in PBS (5 AL) and injected into
the right corpus striatum of the brains of 4- to 5-wk-old Nu/Nu nude mice
(Charles River). Tumors were allowed to develop and monitored by
luciferase bioluminescence imaging. All animal studies were done under
protocols approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of
University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center.
Noninvasive intracranial bioluminescence imaging. Serial bioluminescence images of tumor-bearing mice were obtained using the IVIS
Lumina System (Xenogen Corp.) coupled to Living Image data acquisition
software (Xenogen). During imaging, mice were anesthetized with
isoflurane (Baxter International, Inc.) and a solution of D-luciferin
(450 mg/kg in PBS; total volume, 250 AL; Biosynthesis) was administered
s.c. in the neck region. Images were acquired between 10 and 20 min after

luciferin administration and peak luminescence signals were recorded. The
bioluminescence image signals emanating from the tumors were quantified
by measuring photon flux within a region of interest using the Living Image
software package.
Brain sectioning and immunohistochemistry. For pathologic analyses
and immunohistochemistry, brains were fixed in 10% formaldehyde and
processed for H&E staining by standard techniques. Entire brains were
sectioned in 1- to 2-mm coronal blocks and submitted in one cassette for
paraffin embedding and sectioning. Sections (10 Am) were treated with
xylene and washed with ethanol. Antigen retrieval was done by sodium
citrate (10 mmol/L, 20 min) treatment. Sections were then permeabilized in
Triton X-100 and blocked with 5% goat serum. After incubation with
a-53BP1 antibody (Cell Signaling; at 4jC, overnight), cells were treated
(at room temperature, 2 h) with FITC-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody
(Molecular Probes). Sections were washed and mounted in Vectashield
containing 4¶,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (Vector Labs).

Results
EGFRvIII, in cooperation with glioma-relevant tumor
suppressor loss, confers IR resistance to primary murine
astrocytes. We examined the contribution of EGFRvIII to radioresistance in primary astrocytes, the presumptive cells of origin of
GBMs (19). For analyses of IR resistance, we used either Ink4a/Arfnull primary mouse astrocytes (henceforth referred to as Ink4a/

Arf / astrocytes) or astrocytes in which p53/Rb tumor suppressors were inactivated by retroviral expression of SV40-LT
(henceforth referred to as SV40-LT astrocytes). Ink4a/Arf (p16/
p19) and p53/Rb tumor suppressors are frequently lost in GBM
(1, 3, 4). Therefore, these two cell lines, with two distinct, GBMrelevant tumor suppressor backgrounds, are most appropriate for
this study. To assess the effect of EGFRvIII on IR resistance, we
compared EGFRvIII to equivalently expressed levels of EGFRwt or
EGFRkd (Fig. 1A). Resistance to IR was quantified by standard
colony formation assays. Expression of EGFRvIII, but not EGFRwt
or EGFRkd, resulted in dramatically increased survival of both
Ink4a/Arf / astrocytes and SV40-LT astrocytes (Fig. 1B). Radioresistance conferred by EGFRvIII was abrogated by the smallmolecule inhibitor gefitinib (Iressa), which binds to the ATPbinding pocket of EGFR (ref. 6; Fig. 1C). These data suggest that
EGFRvIII signaling is involved in the increased resistance to IR
irrespective of the tumor suppressor background.
EGFRvIII-induced IR resistance correlates with proficient
DSB repair in primary murine astrocytes. The major mechanism by which IR induces lethality is by introducing DSBs. We
examined whether the increased resistance to IR conferred by
EGFRvIII expression might be due to enhanced DSB repair. SV40LT and Ink4a/Arf / parental and EGFRvIII-expressing lines were

EGFRvIII and DNA Double-Strand Break Repair

Figure 3. A genetic link between EGFRvIII and DNA-PKcs in the repair of
radiation-induced DSBs. A, ectopic expression of EGFRvIII in DNA-PKcs+/+ and
DNA-PKcs / MEFs was assayed by Western blotting with a-EGFR and a-H2AX
(loading control) antibodies. B, radiation survival was quantified by colony
formation assays. The fraction of surviving colonies (y axis ) was plotted against
corresponding radiation dose (x axis ). Bars, SE. Note increased survival of
DNA-PKcs+/+ cells expressing EGFRvIII, whereas DNA-PKcs / cells
expressing EGFRvIII show no enhanced survival compared with parental lines.

irradiated with a total dose of 1 Gy, and induction and rate of repair
of DSBs were visualized by immunofluorescence staining for 53BP1
foci as described (ref. 22; Fig. 2A). Compared with parental lines,
the EGFRvIII-expressing lines displayed significantly faster DSB
repair kinetics, completing repair by 4 hours (Fig. 2B). Pretreatment of these cells with gefitinib (Iressa), which inhibits EGFRvIII
signaling (6), slowed down repair to the extent observed in parental
lines. These data clearly link improved repair kinetics with
signaling from the EGFRvIII receptor.
Small-molecule inhibition of DNA-PKcs counters improved
repair and survival exhibited by EGFRvIII-expressing cells.
DNA-PKcs is a critical component of the predominant DSB repair
pathway in mammalian cells—nonhomologous end joining (17, 18).
We tested the hypothesis that EGFR signaling promotes DSB repair
via efficient activation of DNA-PKcs (24–26). To investigate a
possible link between EGFRvIII and DNA-PKcs activity in
glioblastomas, we pretreated EGFRvIII-expressing astrocytes with
NU7026, a potent and specific DNA-PKcs inhibitor (27). Pretreatment with NU7026 blocked fast repair kinetics observed in
EGFRvIII-expressing astrocytes (Fig. 2B). The slower kinetics of
DSB repair, in turn, correlated with increased radiation sensitivity
in survival assays (Fig. 2C), underscoring the potential usefulness of
small-molecule inhibitors of DNA-PKcs as radiosensitizers for GBM
treatment.
A genetic link between EGFRvIII and DNA-PKcs in DSB
repair. Because pharmacologic agents like NU7026 may have
nonspecific effects beyond simply blocking their target protein, a
genetic strategy was used to establish a mechanistic link between
EGFRvIII expression and DNA-PKcs activation. We expressed
EGFRvIII in MEFs from DNA-PKcs knockout mice (ref. 28;
Fig. 3A) and assayed for radiation sensitivity by colony formation

assays. Expression of EGFRvIII in DNA-PKcs+/+ MEFs led to a
considerable increase in radiation resistance (Fig. 3B). Significantly,
expression of EGFRvIII in DNA-PKcs / cells failed to confer any
increase in radioresistance. These results strongly suggest that
DNA-PKcs is required for the radiation resistance conferred by
EGFRvIII.
Activation of Akt-1 in mouse astrocytes mimics the effects of
EGFRvIII expression on DSB repair. EGFRvIII preferentially
signals through the PI3K/Akt-1 pathway (29, 30). Pharmacologic
inhibition of this pathway can block DSB repair and radiosensitize
mammalian cells (31, 32). Conversely, activation of this pathway,
due to loss of PTEN, results in proficient DSB repair and
radioresistance (33). Moreover, Akt-1 is reported to translocate
into the nucleus on irradiation and interact and colocalize with
DNA-PKcs at DSBs (34–36). Therefore, we investigated whether
EGFRvIII expression directly affected DSB repair via the PI3K/Akt-1
pathway. Toward this end, we ectopically expressed constitutively
active, myristylated Akt-1 in SV40-LT astrocytes (Fig. 4A).
Expression of myristylated Akt-1 resulted in efficient DSB repair
similar to that noted on EGFRvIII expression (Fig. 4B). Conversely,
treatment of EGFRvIII-expressing SV40-LT astrocytes with
LY294002, a specific inhibitor of PI3K (37), resulted in slower
DSB repair, similar to that seen in parental cells (Fig. 4B). These
results raise the possibility that EGFRvIII expression might
influence DSB repair via the PI3K/Akt-1 pathway.
EGFRvIII expression results in hyperactivation of DNA-PKcs
in response to IR. Having established a genetic link between
EGFRvIII and DNA-PKcs, we investigated whether EGFRvIII
overexpression resulted in hyperactivation of DNA-PKcs in

Figure 4. Akt-1 activation in mouse astrocytes mimics the effects of EGFRvIII
expression on DSB repair. A, phosphorylation of Akt-1 (at Ser473) was assayed
by Western blotting of SV40-LT–expressing mouse astrocytes (parental),
SV40-LT astrocytes with EGFRvIII overexpression, EGFRvIII-expressing
astrocytes pretreated with a PI3K inhibitor (LY294002), or SV40-LT astrocytes
expressing myristylated Akt-1. B, astrocytes were irradiated (1 Gy) and
immunostained for 53BP1 foci to obtain DSB repair kinetics. Bars, SE. Note
proficient repair in cells expressing myr-Akt-1 (blue line ), whereas repair was
abrogated in EGFRvIII-expressing cells treated with LY294002 (dashed red line ).

response to IR. Activation of DNA-PKcs in response to IR involves
its autophosphorylation at defined serine/threonine residues (18).
The extent of phosphorylation can be quantified by Western
blotting with phospho-specific antibodies and provides an accurate
measure of DNA-PKcs activation in vivo (38). Because these
phospho-specific antibodies recognize only human DNA-PKcs, we
used a human glioma cell line, U87-MG, to examine the effects of
EGFRvIII overexpression on DNA-PKcs activation. Expression of
EGFRvIII, EGFRwt, and EGFRkd in these lines has been described
(39) and was confirmed by Western blotting (Fig. 5A). Expression of
EGFRvIII, but not EGFRwt, in U87 cells significantly increased
radiation survival (Fig. 5B). As with mouse astrocytes, U87 cells
expressing EGFRvIII were significantly sensitized to IR by
pretreatment with the DNA-PKcs inhibitor NU7026. Interestingly,
expression of EGFRkd also resulted in a certain degree of
radiosensitization as reported (13), possibly due to a dominantnegative effect. Most importantly, EGFRvIII expression resulted in
faster and improved DSB repair kinetics compared with parental
U87 lines, recapitulating results obtained with mouse astrocytes
(Fig. 5C).
Having established that EGFRvIII overexpression in U87-MG
cells recapitulates results obtained with mouse astrocytes, we
examined the extent of DNA-PKcs activation after IR in U87 cells.
Phosphorylation of DNA-PKcs was quantified by Western blotting
of nuclear extracts from mock-irradiated or g-irradiated cells with
a phospho-DNA-PKcs antibody (pT2647; refs. 18, 23; Fig. 5D).
Although total levels of DNA-PKcs (bottom) were the same in all
four cell lines, DNA-PKcs activation, as evidenced by its
phosphorylation at T2647, was remarkably higher in cells
expressing EGFRvIII (top), providing a mechanistic link between
EGFRvIII overexpression and improved DSB repair in these cells.
EGFRvIII enhances DSB repair in a mouse orthotopic
glioma model. Given that cell culture conditions in vitro may
not necessarily recapitulate the complex microenvironment within
a tumor in vivo, it is possible that the efficient DSB repair observed
on EGFRvIII expression may not hold true in the context of GBMs.
Therefore, we used, for the first time, a mouse orthotopic glioma
model to visualize DSBs and quantify DNA repair in vivo. U87
parental and U87-EGFRvIII cells (both expressing luciferase
reporters) were stereotactically injected into the striatum of a
cohort of nude mice (19). Intracranial tumor growth was
monitored by serial luciferase imaging. Once tumors reached 50%
maximal tolerated size (established in pilot experiments and
corresponding to approximately 11–13 days postimplantation for
U87-EGFRvIII cells and 16–18 days for U87 parental cells), mice
were anesthetized and received cranial irradiation (total dose, 2
Gy). Mice were anesthetized and cardiac perfused with fixative at
0.5, 2, 4, or 8 hours postirradiation. Brains were paraffin embedded
for routine immunohistochemistry and all tumor sections were
H&E stained to determine the size and location of tumors (Fig. 6A).
Tumor sections were then stained with a-53BP1 antibody to
visualize DSBs and quantify repair kinetics (Fig. 6A). DSB repair
kinetics indicated significantly faster DSB repair rates in tumors
derived from U87-EGFRvIII cells (Fig. 6B). These results, showing
in vivo tumor cell repair kinetics for the first time, suggest that
EGFRvIII overexpression in glioma-relevant orthotopic tumors
significantly augments the repair of radiation-induced DNA
damage.
Mouse orthotopic tumors expressing EGFRvIII are refractory to radiation therapy. To test whether proficient DNA repair
mechanism(s) observed in EGFRvIII-expressing tumors translates

Cancer Res 2009; 69: (10). May 15, 2009

into in vivo radioresistance, we exposed nude mice bearing
intracranial U87 parental or U87-EGFRvIII tumors to whole-brain
radiotherapy. As reported previously (40), the rate of U87-EGFRvIII
intracranial tumor growth is significantly higher than that of U87
parental tumors. Due to the faster growth rate of U87-EGFRvIII
glioma cells, the timing of whole-brain radiotherapy was adjusted
such that IR (4 Gy, one time dose) was delivered when the tumors
were approximately of similar size (at day 6 postimplantation for
U87-EGFRvIII tumors and at day 10 for U87 parental tumors;

repair in cells expressing EGFRvIII (red line ). Bars, SE. D, activation of

U87-EGFRvIII tumors were generated in
nude mice. Once tumors reached 50%
maximal tolerated size, mice received
cranial irradiation (2 Gy) and were
sacrificed at 0.5, 2, 4, and 8 h post-IR to
obtain DNA repair kinetics. Intracranial
tumors were identified in coronal brain
sections by H&E staining. Brain regions
occupied by tumor mass were stained
with a-53BP1 antibody to visualize
radiation-induced DSBs. B, 53BP1 foci
were scored to obtain DSB repair kinetics.

Fig. 6C). Mice were sacrificed when they became moribund or at
day 30 postimplantation. Following whole-brain radiotherapy, the
growth rate of U87 parental tumors was significantly reduced
compared with the growth of mock-irradiated tumors (Fig. 6C). In
contrast, there was no difference in the rate of U87-EGFRvIII tumor
growth with or without radiation. Correspondingly, following
whole-brain radiotherapy, there was little improvement in overall
survival (Kaplan-Meier analyses) of mice bearing U87-EGFRvIII
tumors compared with mock-irradiated mice (Fig. 6D). In contrast,
all mice with U87 parental intracranial tumors that were irradiated
were alive at time of sacrifice. These data indicate that proficient
DSB repair in EGFRvIII-expressing tumors contributes to tumor
radioresistance. We speculate that the extremely rapid and
complete DSB repair observed in EGFRvIII-expressing cells may
prevent the initiation of programmed cell death on IR, resulting in
tumors that are refractory to radiation.

Discussion
Our data show that EGFRvIII overexpression results in increased
resistance to IR in primary mouse astrocytes that either lack Ink4a/
Arf tumor suppressor genes or have functionally suppressed p53/Rb
due to SV40 large T-antigen expression. Similar results are also
observed when EGFRvIII is expressed in human U87-MG glioma
cells. Increased radioresistance is specific to the constitutively active
EGFRvIII receptor and is not seen with equivalent levels of EGFRwt
or EGFRkd expression. EGFRvIII-mediated radioresistance is
associated with hyperactivation of DNA-PKcs and enhanced DSB
repair kinetics, which is possibly transduced via the PI3K/Akt-1
pathway. These observations may provide an important mechanistic
basis for the radioresistance of GBMs, which poses a major obstacle
to effective treatment of these tumors. In addition to identifying
accelerated DSB repair in EGFRvIII-expressing cells in vitro, we also
provide in vivo evidence, using an orthotopic glioma model, that

corroborates these findings and shows these mechanisms to be
operative in the context of the complex tumor microenvironment.
Amplification of the constitutively active EGFRvIII receptor is
one of the most significant genetic alterations in GBM (1, 3, 4).
Expression of EGFRvIII correlates with poor prognosis in patients
(41) and higher tumorigenic capacity in both orthotopic and
de novo mouse glioma models (9, 11). Our work and that of Golding
and colleagues (42) indicate that a major contributing factor to
GBM radioresistance is augmented DSB repair. Our finding that
EGFRvIII stimulates the repair of radiation-induced DNA damage
is not completely unexpected given that EGFR is activated by
radiation (43–46) and EGFRvIII displays even higher levels of
radiation-induced activation compared with the wild-type receptor
(12). Our observation that EGFRvIII promotes the repair of DSBs
via DNA-PKcs is consistent with previous reports showing that, in
human bronchial carcinoma cells, radiation induces EGFR nuclear
import and direct physical association with, and activation of,
DNA-PKcs (24, 47, 48). However, we see no evidence of nuclear
translocation of EGFRvIII under basal conditions or under graded
doses of IR in primary murine astrocytes and in U87 glioma cells or
orthotopic tumors. It is, therefore, plausible that EGFRvIII
expression in GBM tumor cells might enhance DSB repair via the
canonical PI3K/Akt-1 pathway rather than by direct physical
association with DNA-PKcs.
Hyperactivation of the PI3K/Akt-1 pathway due to EGFR
amplification (and concomitant PTEN loss) is one of the hallmarks
of GBMs (1, 3, 4). Moreover, whereas ligand-activated EGFR
stimulates both the Ras/Raf/MAPK and PI3K/Akt-1 pathways (7),
EGFRvIII preferentially activates PI3K/Akt-1 (29, 30). Recent
reports have suggested that activated Akt-1 may play a role in
the repair of DSBs. Blocking PI3K/Akt-1 signaling using smallmolecule inhibitors impairs DSB repair in GBM (33) and breast
cancer (31) cells, resulting in radiation sensitivity. Conversely,
hyperactivation of PI3K/Akt-1 due to PTEN deletion promotes DSB
repair and radioresistance (33). We find that a PI3K inhibitor,
LY294002 (37), can abrogate the accelerated DSB repair conferred
by EGFRvIII overexpression and that hyperactivation of Akt-1
mimics the effects of EGFRvIII expression on DSB repair in
astrocytes. A close physical association between Akt-1 and DNAPKcs at sites of DSBs on IR has been shown (34–36). Activation of
DNA-PKcs by IR involves its phosphorylation at several serine/
threonine residues (17, 18). Because Akt-1 is a serine/threonine

kinase, it is conceivable that the hyperphosphorylation of DNAPKcs observed by us in EGFRvIII-expressing cells may be
potentiated by activated Akt-1. Indeed, small interfering RNA–
mediated knockdown of Akt-1 has been recently shown to
attenuate DNA-PKcs autophosphorylation on IR (49). The presence
of major components of the PI3K/Akt-1 pathway in the nucleus
(50) presages a more intimate link between RTK signaling and
nuclear processes like DNA repair than has previously been
postulated. In future studies, it will be important to elucidate the
precise mechanism by which PI3K/Akt-1 activation by EGFRvIII
might promote DNA-PKcs hyperactivation in GBM tumor cells.
Our finding that gefitinib (Iressa) can abrogate the proficient
DSB repair and radiation resistance due to EGFRvIII is consistent
with data from GBM clinical trials in which 15% to 20% of GBM
patients experience significant tumor regression in response to
EGFR small-molecule inhibitors (51, 52). Our results with a smallmolecule inhibitor of DNA-PKcs, showing significant radiosensitization of murine astrocytes and human glioma cells expressing
EGFRvIII, are important from a therapeutic standpoint. Several
DNA-PKcs inhibitors are currently being developed as radiosensitizers (53), and it may be worthwhile in the future to develop
formulations of DNA-PKcs inhibitors that are compatible with
in vivo testing in preclinical GBM models. In aggregate, our results
show that DNA-PKcs hyperactivation and proficient DSB repair in
EGFRvIII-expressing cells and tumors provide a mechanistic basis
for the marked radioresistance of GBMs with EGFR amplification
and PTEN loss (52). These results suggest that DNA-PKcs and/or
EGFR inhibition concurrent with radiation might be an effective
strategy for radiosensitizing high-grade gliomas.
