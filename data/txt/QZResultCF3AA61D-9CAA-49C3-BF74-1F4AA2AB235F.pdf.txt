ABSTRACT
Side population (SP) contains cancer stem-like cells (CSLCs). In this study, we
characterized SP cells from nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) cell lines and found that
SP cells had a higher self-renewal ability in vitro and greater tumorigenicity in vivo.
The AKT pathway was activated in NPC SP cells. DC120, a 2-pyrimidyl-5-amidothiazole
inhibitor of the ATP binding site of AKT, inhibited phosphorylation of FKHRL1 and
GSK-3β. DC120 inhibited SP fraction, the sphere-forming ability in vitro and growth of
primary xenografts as well as secondary xenografts’ tumor recurrence. This inhibition
was accompanied by reduced expression of stem-related gene Sox2 due to induction
of p27 and miR-30a. A combination of DC120 and CDDP more effectively inhibited NPC
cells compared with monotherapy in vitro and in vivo. Clinical evaluation of DC120
is warranted.

apoptosis, autophagy, glucose metabolism, DNA doublestrand break repair and tumorigenesis [6–10]. Loss or
mutation of tumor suppressor PTEN, amplification or
mutation of PI3K, activation or mutation of growth factor
receptors and oncogenes, and amplification of AKT itself
are involved in the activation of AKT in tumors [10–12].
Recently, increasing evidence suggests that the activation
of AKT has a key role in the function of CSLCs and
modulates the percent of SP cells in a variety of cancers,
including esophageal carcinoma [13], glioma tumors [14],
lung cancer [15] and breast cancer [16]. Further studies
demonstrate that constitutive activation of AKT promotes
CSLC resistance to treatment with chemotherapy and/
or radiation therapy partially by downregulating the
expression of p27 [17], a well-known tumor suppressor.
AKT kinase has become an attractive target for
small molecular drug discovery. To date, researchers have
developed many AKT inhibitors, including targeting the ATP

INTRODUCTION
Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is the most
frequent head and neck tumor in South China with
the highest incidence rate of up to 54.7/100,000/year
[1]. Despite improvements in conventional treatment,
approximately 30% of patients with locoregionally
advanced disease will subsequently relapse, frequently
with associated metastases, and develop resistance to
first-line drugs [2]. Accumulating evidence suggests that
side population cells [3], a rare population of cells from
primary tumors or cancer cell lines, are enriched in a subset
of tumor-initiating or cancer stem-like cells (CSLCs) [4],
which contribute to tumor metastasis and recurrence as well
as tumor resistance to both radiation and chemotherapy [5].
It is well established that the PI3K/AKT signaling
pathway is involved in a wide variety of biological
processes, including cell proliferation, differentiation,

binding site, pleckstrin homology domain [18], or protein
substrate binding site of AKT. Several of these inhibitors,
such as MK-2206, GDC0068, and perifosine are currently in
phase I and II trials alone or in combination to treat multiple
types of cancers [3, 19]. To find compounds that target AKT
kinase, we designed and synthesized a series of 2-pyrimidyl5-amidothiazole compounds based on the ATP binding site
of AKT. We had previously reported that DC120, which
was screened out from these compounds, exhibited an
inhibitory effect on cancer cells in vitro and in vivo through
the inhibition of AKT kinase activity and the blockade of
the AKT downstream signaling pathway [20, 21]. In this
study, we sought to explore the involvement of DC120 in
the regulation of NPC cancer stem-like SP cells. Our data
showed that DC120 inhibited the proliferation of human
NPC CNE-2-S-18/SP and CNE-1/SP cells in vitro and
in vivo and significantly reduced the self-renewal and
tumor-initiating capacities of cancer stem-like SP cells via
the induction of cell apoptosis. Additionally, we observed
that DC120 suppressed the cancer stem-like SP cells through
the inhibition of AKT kinase activity and the blockade
of the PI3K/AKT downstream signaling pathway, further
regulating Sox2 expression. Moreover, we found that
the combination of DC120 and cisplatin (CDDP) has a
significant synergistic effect, and DC120 could sensitize the
inhibitory effect of CDDP on NPC cells.

the tumor-initiating capacity by injecting sorted CNE2-S-18/SP cells and CNE-2-S-18/NSP cells into NOD/
SCID mice. Tumors were generated with 1,000 SP cells,
which was 10-fold less than was required for tumor
seeding by NSP cells and grew at a faster rate compared
with CNE-2-S-18/NSP cells (Figure 1F, Table 1).

DC120 down-regulated the activated PI3K/AKT
pathway in NPC cancer stem-like SP cells
As reported, the activation of the PI3K/AKT pathway
plays an important role in the maintenance of cancer stemlike SP cells [4, 23]. Among the cancer cell lines used in this
study, both CNE2-S18 and CNE1 cell lines were previously
confirmed to have hyper-activated PI3K/AKT signaling
due to the PIK3CA and HRAS mutation, respectively. Our
results indicated that the phosphorylation status of AKT on
Thr308 and Ser473 and the phosphorylation levels of AKT
downstream targets (FKHRL1 and GSK-3β) were much
higher in SP cells than those in NSP cells (Figure 2A),
suggesting that the PI3K/AKT pathway was activated in NPC
cancer stem-like SP cells. We also verified the expression of
stem cell transcription factors in SP and NSP cells, and found
that the expressions of C-myc, klf4, Sox2 were higher in SP
than in NSP, which further confirmed that the SP cells has
the characteristics of stem cells (Figure 2B). As the inhibition
of substrate phosphorylation can reflect the inhibition of
AKT activity, we examined whether DC120 (Figure 2C)
could inhibit AKT and its downstream targets. Figure 2D
and 2E showed that the phosphorylation levels of FKHRL1
and GSK-3β were all partially attenuated by DC120
dose and time dependently without affecting the amount of
total proteins. However, the phosphorylation of Thr308 and
Ser473 on AKT increased concomitantly, although AKT
kinase activity was inhibited, the conformational change of
AKT led to its self-hyperphosphorylation. More precisely,
phosphorylation of FKHRL1 and GSK-3β was reduced
within 30 minutes after exposure to 10 μmol/L DC120 in
CNE-2-S-18/SP and CNE-1/SP cells. These data suggested
that the down regulation of the PI3K/AKT self-renewal
pathway might contribute to the inhibitory effects of DC120
on NPC cancer stem-like SP cells.

RESULTS
NPC SP cells have the characteristics of cancer
stem-like cells (CSLCs)
It is believed that certain ATP-binding cassette
(ABC) transporters (e.g. ABCG2/BCRP) can pump
out the fluorescent dye Hoechst 33342, which may be
why the SP phenotype exhibits a low level of Hoechst
fluorescence intensity [14]. Using a FACS assay, we
sorted SP cells in human NPC cell lines CNE-2-S-18 and
CNE-1, which were characterized by a low fluorescent
“tail” in the flow cytometry histogram (Figure 1A). In
the present study, we found that the average percent of
SP cells was approximately 60.0% in the CNE-2-S-18
cell line and approximately 2.0% in the CNE-1 cell line;
which was consistent with the results of previous studies
[22], however, 5 μM FTC, the ABCG2-specific inhibitor,
could significantly decrease the SP proportion to 0.2%
(P < 0.01) and 0.1% (P < 0.01), respectively. We also
examined whether SP cells sorted through a FACS assay
displayed abilities associated with human CSLCs. We
observed that not only the size of the spheres increased by
8- to 125-fold (P < 0.01; Figure 1B), but also the number
of spheres of SP cells increased by approximately 5-fold
(P < 0.01; Figure 1C) relative to matched NSP cells when
grown in suspension cultures, an in vitro measure of CSLC
self-renewal activity. The result of colony formation assay
indicated that SP cell proliferation were better than that of
NSP cell (Figure 1D and 1E). We next directly estimated

DC120 inhibited NPC cancer stem-like SP cells
in vitro
Using an MTT assay, we determined the effect of
DC120 on the proliferation of human NPC SP and NSP
cells. S-18-SP/NSP and CNE-1 SP/NSP cells were sorted by
FACS analysis assay and then exposed to DC120 (0.625–40
μmol/L) for 48 hours. As shown in Figure 3A, exposure
to DC120 resulted in a dose-dependent inhibition of cell
viability, and compared with NSP cells, SP populations
were more sensitive to DC120 especially at low doses for
S-18 and CNE2 cells.
To examine whether DC120 could inhibit the SP
phenotype in vitro, we performed a FACS analysis assay.

The size of the spheres was estimated using V = (4/3) πR3. Magnification, 100 ×. Columns, mean (n = 3); bars, SD. The number of spheres
greater than 50 cells was counting. (D–E) SP and NSP cells were plated in triplicate at 200 cells per well in 6-well plates, and cultured for
approximately 7 days. Colony Formation Efficiency estimated using CFE= the number of colony forming/200 × 100%. Columns, mean
(n = 3); bars, SD. The number of colony greater than 50 cells was counting. (F) Tumor growth curves after injection of NOD/SCID mice
with the limited dilution concentration of CNE-2-S-18/SP or CNE-2-S-18/NSP. Once they became palpable, the CNE-2-S-18/SP tumor
(red) cells grew at a higher rate than the CNE-2-S-18/NSP (blue) cells in all cases.

As shown in Figure 3B, 2.5 μmol/L DC120 significantly
decreased the number of SP cells by over 76% in the
CNE-2-S-18 cell line (P < 0.01) and 23% in the CNE- 1
cell line (P < 0.05), and 10 μmol/L produced a greater
than 89% reduction of SP cells in the CNE-2-S-18 cell line
(P < 0.01) and 71% in the CNE-1 cell line (P < 0.01). To
evaluate whether DC120 could suppress the formation of
nasospheres in vitro, we exposed freshly sorted CNE- 2-S18/SP and CNE-1/SP cells to varying concentrations
of DC120 and then cultured them for 7–14 days in the
presence of the compound. As shown in Figures 3C
and 3D, DC120 inhibited the formation of spheres. Not
only did the number of spheres decline by 75% to 99%
(P < 0.01; Figure 3D) but also the size of the spheres was
reduced by 8- to 132-fold (P < 0.01; Figure 3C). The IC50
values were approximately 0.5–1 μmol/L for both the
CNE- 2-S-18/SP and CNE-1/SP spheres. Another recognized
AKT inhibitor GDC0068 was employed, the same effect

was obtained (Figure S1A–S1C). These data showed that
DC120 inhibited the cancer stem-like SP cells at similar
concentrations to those that inhibited nasosphere formation
and at approximately 7-fold lower concentrations than those
that inhibited cancer cells as determined by the MTT assay.

DC120 induced apoptosis in NPC cancer
stem-like SP cells
To confirm whether DC120 inhibits the cancer stemlike SP cell phenotype by inducing apoptosis in vitro, an
Annexin V-FITC/propidium iodide double staining assay
was used to detect the apoptotic cells. In Figure 4A, the
percentage of Annexin V-positive cells were higher in
CNE-2-S-18/SP cells (6.5%, 15.6%, 75.9%) than that
in CNE-2-S-18/NSP cells (5.9%, 10.8%, 61.5%), when
CNE-2-S-18-SP/NSP cells treated with 2.5, 5 or 10
μmol/L DC120 for 48 hours. When CNE-1-SP/NSP cells

Moreover, CDDP treatment increased the percentage
of SP cells (Figure 5B), which was similar to other
findings and may play a role in resistance [24]. We

effectively diminished cancer stem-like
SP cells in vivo

number and size of the spheres significantly decreased
5 to 10 fold and 16 to 128 fold compared with controls
(P < 0.05; Figure 6D, 6E). However, the tumors treated
with CDDP alone increased the proportion of SP cells
by 9.1% (P < 0.05; Figure 6B, 6C), and had a similar
nasosphere-forming ability compared with untreated
controls (Figure 6D, 6E). Additionally, primary xenografts
treated with DC120 and CDDP in combination displayed
a 64.8% reduction in SP cells (P < 0.01; Figure 6B, 6C)
and decreased nasosphere formation (Figure 6D, 6E),
Furthermore, we injected 100,000 cells obtained from 4
groups of primary tumor cells into secondary recipient
mice and examined the growth of the secondary tumors.
We observed that cancer cells obtained from DC120treated mice resulted in the slowest tumor recurrence,
reaching a final tumor size ranging from 300 to 500 mm3
in the secondary mice (Figure 6F). But the cancer cells
from DDP-treated mice showed the most rapid tumor
regrowth, reaching a final tumor size ranging from 600
to 800 mm3 in the secondary mice (Figure 6F). And the
tumor regrowth in DC120 combined with CDDP treatment
was the slowest among the four groups (Figure 6F). These
data illustrated that DC120 in combination with CDDP

To determine whether DC120 could target NPC
cancer stem-like SP cells in vivo, we established primary
CNE-2-S-18 xenografts and gave an i.p. administration
of 8% solvent (negative control), DC120, CDDP, or
DC120+CDDP on day 5 after implantation. Treatment
with DC120 noticeably suppressed the tumor growth, and
the tumor growth inhibition (T/C %) was approximately
48.7% (P < 0.05; Figure 6A, Table 4). Meanwhile, the
inhibitory rate of the CDDP group was 31.4% (Figure
6A, Table 4). DC120 plus CDDP treatment in vivo led
to an even greater reduction in tumor growth, and the
inhibitory rate was 78.7% (P < 0.01; Figure 6A, Table 4).
No obvious toxicity was observed in mice receiving the
above treatments (Figure S2). Then, tumors were isolated
from the animals, and single tumor cells were analyzed
by FACS assay or seeded into ultra-low adhesion 6-well
plates in serum-free media. The proportion of SP cells
isolated from DC120-treated tumors demonstrated a
44.6% reduction (P < 0.01; Figure 6B, 6C), and the

binding to the mRNAs of protein-coding genes to direct
their posttranscriptional repression [28]. As a key regulator
in development and carcinogenesis, Sox2 also displayed
close associations with microRNAs. According to reports
previous, at translational level, activities of Sox2 were
controlled by several miRNAs, namely microRNA-145,
microRNA-126, microRNA-9 and microRNA-21 [29,
30]. To explore the role of miRNAs in DC120-mediated
Sox2 down-regulation, we analyzed the differences in
miRNAs profiles between control (DMSO solution) and
DC120 treatment in CNE-2-S-18-SP cells from miRNAs
microarrays. The cells were separately cultured with a
DMSO solution or 10 μmol/L DC120 for 15 h, and total
RNA from all of the cells was extracted. The expressed
fold changes of miRNAs from DC120-treated cells were
normalized to the DMSO-treated control cells. From
the results, 7616 miRNAs with significantly different
expression ratios (p < 0.05) were selected. Among these,
80 miRNAs were up-regulated and 78 were downregulated, date was not shown. We then chose 20 miRNAs
through the qRT-PCR, and our results showed that 9
miRNAs were up-regulated after treatment with DC120,
which was consistent with the results of the microarray
(Figure S4A). Among these, miR-30a exhibited a high
fold change (3.5-fold) according to the microarray data.
Similarly, DC120-treated cells showed a higher expression
of miR-30a (5.3-fold) than control cells in real-time PCR
(RT-PCR) analysis (Figure S4B). These results indicated
that miR-30a expression was up-regulated by DC120. To
investigate the role of miR-30a in DC120-treated cells,
we explored its potential targets using a bioinformatics
approach of complementary base pairing (Figure
S4C). The relative luciferase activity of the reporter
that contained the wild-type 3’ UTR was significantly
suppressed when miR-30a was cotransfected (Figure
S4D). In contrast, the luciferase activity of the mutant
reporter was unaffected by the cotransfection of miR-30a
(Figure S4D), indicating that miR-30a suppressed Sox2
gene expression using the miR-30a-binding sequence at
the 3’ UTR of the Sox2 gene. Additionally, the ectopic
expression of miR-30a caused a decrease in Sox2 protein
expression and mRNA levels in CNE-2-S-18 cells (Figure
S4E–S4G). These data demonstrate that miR-30a may
directly target the Sox2 gene via seed matches on both 3’
UTR. Sox2 was down-regulated and p27 was up-regulated
when CNE-2-S-18 cells were treated with another an AKT
inhibitor, GDC0068, which also induced the mRNA level

DC120 repressed NPC cancer stem-like SP cells
through downregulating Sox2 expression
The subsequent studies focused on the signaling
pathways involved in the DC120-mediated repression
of stem-like SP cells in NPC cancer cells. As mentioned
earlier, as AKT can phosphorylate p27 T157 to impair
the nuclear import and function of p27, constitutive
activation of AKT promotes CSLC resistance to treatment
with chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy partially
by down-regulating the expression of p27. Inhibition of
PI3K/AKT pathway by a PI3K inhibitor LY294002 or
a kinase dead dominant-negative AKT mutant can upregulate the levels of p27 in cancer cells [25, 26]. The
embryonic stem cell gene SRY (sex determining region
Y)-box 2 (Sox2), a transcription factor, is involved in the
regulation of embryonic stem cells [24] and plays a key
role in maintaining the pluripotent properties of stem cells.
As a known tumor suppressor, P27 can directly repress
Sox2 expression in induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs)
through binding to the Sox2 promoter [27]. Our results
showed that the protein expression level of p27 was upregulated dose and time dependently in CNE-2-S-18 cells
after treatment with DC120, while the protein expression
and mRNA level of Sox2 was down-regulated dose and
time dependently (Figure 7A, 7B). To further demonstrate
the involvement of DC120 in the repression of Sox2 in
NPC cells, two different p27 siRNAs were employed to
knock down p27 in CNE-2-S-18 cells. As shown in Figure
7C, a transient transfection with 50 nM siRNA downregulated p27 expression by at least 90%. Accordingly,
the decrease of the Sox2 expression levels caused by
DC120 was blocked when the expression of p27 was
down-regulated. To further verified Sox2 was the target
gene to regulate the efficacy of the DC120, we found
overexpression of Sox2 could prevent from decrease of the
SP population in NPC cells by DC120 treatment (Figure
7D, 7E). Furthermore, knockdown of the Sox2 by siRNA
could decrease the proportion of SP cells in NPC (Figure
S3A, S3B). Collectively, these results demonstrated that
DC120 repressed Sox2 through increasing p27 expression.

results demonstrate that DC120 regulates Sox2 via upregulation of p27 and miR-30a.

cells in breast cancer, prostate cancer, esophageal cancer,
glioblastoma multiforme, and non-small cell lung cancer
[4, 14, 15, 36, 38, 39]. Furthermore, PI3K/AKT signaling
is also associated with chemoresistance in a subset of
cancer cells called SP cells, which contribute to drug
resistance [40]. Therefore, targeting PI3K/AKT signaling
may be beneficial in cancer treatment by eliminating
cancer stem-like SP cells. In this study, we first found
that AKT kinase and its signaling pathway were hyperactivated in NPC cancer stem-like SP cells (Figure 2A).
Additionally in the presence of DC120 phosphorylation
of AKT downstream targets such as FKHRL1 and GSK3β were markedly decreased in cancer stem-like SP cells.
Simultaneously, a concomitant increase in the Thr308
and Ser473 phosphorylation of AKT was also observed
(Figure 2D, 2E), which might be caused by a feedback
loop induced by DC120 or a direct consequence of DC120
binding to the ATP binding site of AKT, as we previously
reported [20]. Importantly, we found that DC120 could
preferentially target cancer stem-like SP cells in vitro and
in vivo. Firstly, we found that SP cells were more sensitive
to DC120 by MTT assays (Figure 3A), then we confirmed
that DC120 noticeably suppressed cancer stem-like SP cells’
self-renewal and tumor-initiating abilities by reducing the
cancer stem-like SP cell fraction and nasosphere formation
in vitro (Figure 3B and 3D). It is worth noting that the
concentrations of DC120 that were capable of suppressing
nasosphere formation and the proportion of cancer stemlike SP cells were much lower than those that exhibited
anti-proliferative effects in CNE-2-S-18 and CNE-1 cells
(Figure 3B and 3D). Another recognized AKT inhibitor
GDC0068 was employed and the same effect was obtained

DISCUSSION
Here we report that a new compound DC120
selectively targeted NPC cancer stem-like SP cells and
sensitized NPC cells to conventional chemotherapy
in vitro and in vivo by blocking the AKT signaling
pathway and inhibiting Sox2 expression.
Cancer stem-like cells (CSLCs) refer to a sub­
population of tumor cells with important properties, including
self-renewal (by symmetric and asymmetric division),
differentiation capacity, chemoresistance to standard cancer
therapies, cancer invasion and metastasis [5, 31–33]. The
therapy of specifically targeted cancer stem cells may be the
breakthrough for tumor therapy [34, 35]. Diverse cell surface
markers such as CD44 and CD133 have been used for the
identification of CSCs in human tumors. So far, the markers
for nasopharyngeal carcinoma stem cells is not clear. Hoechstexcluding side populations sorted from hematological and
solid malignancies, including ovarian cancer [24], breast
cancer [36], esophageal carcinoma [13] and nasopharyngeal
carcinoma [37], have been reported to be enriched for CSLCs.
In our study, we also found that NPC cancer stem-like SP
cells had the ability of self-renew and initiate tumors through
nasosphere formation assays, colony formation assays and
NOD/SCID xenograft assays (Figure 1B and 1F).

(Figure S1A–S1C). In addition, DC120 decreased the SP
percentage in xenograft tumors, and single cells isolated
from these tumors lost their nasosphere-forming capacity
and reduced the regrowth of tumors in secondary mice
(Figure 6B and 6F), which is the more compelling evidence
that DC120 is able to effectively deplete cancer stem-like
SP cells in vivo. However, it should be noted that although
DC120 preferentially targeted cancer stem-like SP cells, the
compound was able to inhibit proliferation in most of the
cancer cells (Figure 3A) and primary tumor growth of CNE2-S-18 xenografts (Figure 6A).CDDP alone mainly targeted
at the NSP population of NPC cells, and DC120 mostly
aimed at the SP population, the combination treatment
was actually more potent in suppressing NPC cell growth
(Figure 5C). Further study confirmed that DC120 decreased
cancer stem-like SP cell viability mainly due to induction
of apoptosis, as demonstrated by an increased sub-G1
population, Annexin V-positive cells and cleaved PARP in
tumor samples (Figure 4A–4D). Therefore, we suggested
that DC120 could inhibit AKT kinase activity and block its
signaling pathway via induction of apoptosis in NPC cancer
stem-like SP cells.
The negative cell cycle regulator p27 has previously
been reported as a commonly downregulated tumor
suppressive protein in NPC [41]. Chan et al. [42] found
that stable p27 protein expression may be due to
downregulation of the p27 ubiquitination mediator Skp2
through downregulating AKT and pAKT in NPC cells. In
our present study, we found that DC120 targeted AKT in
cancer stem-like SP cells, and the effect was correlated
with the reduction of pAKT and the increased expression
of p27 (Figure 7A). Recently, a new study reported that
p27 directly repressed the expression of stem cell marker
Sox2 during embryonic stem cell differentiation [27]. The
embryonic stem cell gene SRY (sex determining region
Y)-box 2 (Sox2), a transcription factor, is involved in
the regulation of embryonic stem cells [24] and plays a
key role in maintaining the pluripotent properties of stem
cells [43]. Further studies revealed that Sox2 was a crucial
player in maintaining the stemness of GSC (Glioma stem
cells) through miR-9 [44], CSCs in HNSCC (Head and
Neck squamous cell carcinoma) through miR-302 [45],
CSCs in breast tumors [25], mammalian neural stem cells
[46], CD44+ cancer stem-like cells in EBV-associated
nasopharyngeal carcinoma [47], cancer stem-cell from
squamous-cell carcinoma [48] and SP (side population)
cells in NSCLC [15]. All these studies revealed that Sox2
expression promoted and maintained the stemness of
CSCs through similar manner.
In this study, we also proved that knockdown of the
Sox2 by siRNA could decrease the proportion of SP cells
in NPC (Figure S3A, S3B). Also, we found that DC120
could inhibit Sox2 expression through increasing p27
expression (Figure 7A). Significantly, Sox2 was restored
when p27 was knocked down by specific siRNAs after
treatment with DC120 (Figure 7C).
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Apart from p27, miRNAs are one of the most
common regulatory factors in NPC [49–51], and they
play physiological and pathophysiological roles in cell
proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis by regulating
protein expression in a post-transcriptional manner [52, 53].
Wu et al. [54] identified miR-30d as a tumor suppressor,
which was regulated by a new AKT/FOXO/miR-30d/
MTDH signaling transduction pathway. In our study,
we found that miR-30a was up-regulated after DC120
treatment (Figure S4B). Meanwhile, our results revealed
that Sox2 was directly targeted by miR-30a to induce Sox2
down-regulation (Figure S4F, S4G). Above all, our study
proved that DC120 inhibited Sox2 via increasing p27 and
miR-30a expression. Overexpression of Sox2 prevented
from decrease of the SP population in NPC cells by
DC120 treatment (Figure 7D, 7E). Combined with DC120mediated Sox2 downregulation and repression of the SP
population and knockdown of Sox2-induced decrease of
the SP percentage, this result suggested that DC120 could
repress SP population via down-regulation of Sox2.
Combining AKT inhibitors with other cancer
therapeutics is a promising way to improve the tumor
therapeutic window. In this study, we found that DC120
could enhance NPC cells’ chemosensitivity to CDDP
therapy. Although CDDP could inhibit cancer cell
proliferation, NSP cells were more sensitive to CDDP than
SP cells (Figure 5A), and it increased the percentage of
cancer stem-like SP cells (Figure 5B), which further proved
that conventional treatments target the bulk of cancer cells
but do not affect CSCs [24]. However, DC120 effectively
reversed the resistance of NPC cells to CDDP treatment
(Figure 5C) and showed a synergistic effect in combination
with CDDP (Table 2 and Table 3), which supports further
exploration of the combination efficacy of DC120 with
other anticancer agents in anticancer therapy.
In summary, our data provide evidence of DC120’s
sustained anti-cancer effect in stem-like SP cells and a
promising development of future therapies with DC120.
DC120 preferentially suppressed the proliferation of
cancer stem-like SP cells and the bulk of cancer cells. The
combination of DC120 and CDDP had a synergistic effect
in targeting cancer stem-like SP cells. These data provide
validation for the development of DC120 to treat cancer
stem-like SP cells and offer a novel treatment strategy for
NPC in the future.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
DC120 preparation
For all of the in vitro studies, compound DC120
was dissolved in DMSO at a concentration of 50 mM
and stored at −20°C. For the tumor xenograft studies,
DC120 was formulated in 8% solvent diluent (DMSO/
(Cremophor EL+ethanol), 1:3) at a concentration of
50 mg/ml. Its structure was reported previously [20, 21].

supplement (Invitrogen). Then, different concentrations
of DC120 were added to the SP cells, and the cells were
cultured for approximately 2 weeks. The spheroids, also
called nasospheres, were photographed and counted using
a microscope.

The human NPC cell line CNE-1 was cultured and
conserved by Sun Yat-sen University cancer center from
1982 and have been used in previous study [41], and the
S18 cell line is a single cell clone of CNE-2 (a kind gift
from Dr. Chao-Nan Qian in 2011, China) [55] and has
also been used in previous study [22]. Both cell lines were
authenticated by Applied Biosystems on Nov 16, 2012
via STR analysis. 293T cell line was obtained from the
American Type Culture Collection in 2010. The cells were
cultivated in DMEM medium supplemented with 10%
fetal bovine serum in a 5% CO2 humidified atmosphere
at 37°C. GAPDH, AKT, phospho-AKT (Ser473),
phospho-AKT (Thr308), GSK3α/β, cleaved PARP, p27,
Sox2, α-tubulin primary antibodies and a horseradish
peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody were pur­
chased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (California, CA,
USA). Anti-phospho-FKHRL1, phospho-GSK3β, and
chemiluminescence reagents were obtained from Cell
Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA, USA). Hoechst
33342, Fumitremorgin C (FTC), DAPI, MTT and DMSO
were acquired from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA).

Colony formation assay
S18-SP, S18-NSP or CNE1-SP, CNE1-NSP  cells
were counted, plated in triplicate at 200 cells per well
in 6-well plates (Corning), and cultured in DMEM
(supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum) for
approximately 7 days. Then, the cells were washed
twice with PBS and fixed in methanol for approximately
10 minutes. After two additional washes with PBS, the
cells were dyed with crystal violet for 30 minutes. Then,
the crystal violet was washed out and the numbers of the
colonies were counted.

Non-obese diabetic/severe combined
immunodeficient (NOD/SCID) mouse model
The procedures involving mice and their care were
in accordance with the National Institutes of Health
Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals with
the UKCCCR (UKCCCR, 1998). NOD/SCID mice
were purchased from the animal institute of the Chinese
Academy of Medical Science. CNE-2-S-18 cells were
suspended in serum-free DMEM media after FACS, and
both CNE-2-S-18/NSP and CNE-2-S-18/SP cells were
injected subcutaneously into the left and right flank of the
mice at 1 × 103, 1 × 104, 1 × 105, and 1 × 106 cells. The
tumors were measured with a caliper, and the volume was
calculated using V = 1/2(width2 × length).

MTT assay
The cells were seeded in a 96-well plate (Falcon) at
3,000 to 5,000 cells per well. Cell viability was determined
by MTT assay. The IC50 and combination index (CI)
values were calculated using CalcuSyn software (Biosoft)
as described previously [20, 56].

Fluorescence-activated cell sorting
(FACS) assay
The CNE-2-S-18 and CNE-1 cells or single cells
obtained from primary xenograft tumors were harvested
and resuspended at a concentration of 1 × 106 cells/ml.
Hoechst 33342 was then added to a final concentration
of 5 μg/ml and incubated for 90 min at 37°C in the dark
with interval mixing. After washing twice with PBS, the
cells were kept at 4°C in the dark before flow cytometry
analysis (EPICS ALTRA Flow Cytosorter, Beckman
Coulter). Meanwhile, a subset of the cells was incubated
with 5 μM FTC for 5 min at 37°C prior to adding Hoechst
33342. Flow cytometry data were analyzed using FlowJo
software.

Suspension culture

The cells were harvested and lysed in 1× cell
lysis buffer (Cell Signaling Technology) with 1  mM
phenylmethanesulfonyl
fluoride
(PMSF)
added
immediately before use. The protein concentration
was estimated using a Pierce BCA protein assay kit.
Equal amounts of protein (20 μg–40 μg) were separated
electrophoretically on 8%–15% SDS-polyacrylamide
gels, transferred onto PVDF membranes (Millipore), and
analyzed as previously described [20].

Cells were cultured in a six-well plate and exposed to
DC120. The cells were harvested and stained with AnnexinV-FLUOS Solution and PI Solution provided by the AnnexinV-FLUOS Staining Kit (Roche, Switzerland) for 10–15 min
or fixed overnight in 75% ethanol at −4°C and resuspended in
1 ml of staining solution (50 μg/ml PI, 50 μg/ml RNase) for
15 min. Then, apoptotic or sub-G1 phase cells were analyzed
by flow cytometry (Beckman Coulter, USA).

days, (iii) DC120 daily or (iv)CDDP × 4 days+DC120
daily, were administered intraperitoneally for 16 days
for each group. The tumor volumes and body weights of
the mice were recorded. When all of the control tumors
developed to more than 2,000 mm3, the nude mice were
sacrificed. Tumor growth inhibition (T/C %), which was
used to evaluate the tumor response to the drugs, was
calculated using the ratio of the average tumor weight
of the treated group (T) to the average tumor weight of
the control group (C). Fresh cells from the dissociated
primary tumors were suspended and counted. All of the 6
secondary nude mice were inoculated with 100,000 cells
from each group of primary mouse tumors. The growth of
the tumors was monitored, and the tumor volumes were
measured twice weekly.

A reporter assay using luciferase was performed
as previously described [57]. 293T cells (2 × 104)
plated in a 24-well plate were cotransfected with
internal control renilla luciferase (Rluc), reporter
firefly luciferase (Fluc) with a wild-type or mutated
Sox2 3’ UTR, and either miR-30a minics or a miR30a inhibitor using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen)
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Fluc and
Rluc activities were assayed using the Dual Luciferase
Reporter Assay System (Promega, Fitchburg, WI, USA)
48 hours after transfection, and Fluc activity was then
normalized to Rluc activity. The Fluc-Sox2 3’ UTR
construct was generated from 293T cell cDNA using 5ʹ
CCGCTCGAGGGGCCGGACAGCGAACTGGAGG 3ʹ
and 5′ATAAGAATGCGGCCGCTCAGTGTCCATATTT
CAAAAATTTATTT 3ʹ primers. Each treatment was
performed in triplicate and repeated in three independent
experiments.

Statistical analysis
Student’s t-test was used to evaluate the statistical
significance of the result at the 95% confidence level,
and a P value less than 0.05 was considered statistically
significance.
