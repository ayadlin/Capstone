with carboplatin and docetaxel, a commonly used regimen for advanced NSCLC,
cetuximab has exhibited synergistic interaction in preclinical studies. Therefore, a
phase 2 study was conducted to evaluate the efficacy of the combination of cetuximab, carboplatin, and docetaxel for the treatment of advanced NSCLC.

onsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is diagnosed at an advanced
stage in approximately 40% of the patients.1 Systemic chemotherapy is the primary treatment modality for advanced-stage
NSCLC.2 The platinum-based combination regimens are considered
the ‘standard of care’ for patients with advanced NSCLC. Both quantitative and qualitative benefits have been noted with combination
chemotherapy for advanced NSCLC patients with a good performance
status.3,4 Several 2-drug regimens are in routine use because com-

parisons of various 2-drug regimens have yielded
similar efficacy in this setting.3,5,6 The efforts in
recent years to improve upon the efficacy of 2-drug
combinations have primarily focused on the addition of a targeted agent to standard chemotherapy.
Cetuximab is an immunoglobulin (Ig) G1 chimeric monoclonal antibody against the epidermal
growth factor receptor (EGFR).7 The activation of the
EGFR pathway leads to proliferation, metastasis, and
angiogenesis, thus facilitating the progression of
cancer.8 In addition, in vitro studies suggest the
importance of IgG1-mediated antibody dependent
cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) activity as an
immunologic mechanism of cetuximab in lung cancer
patients.9 The EGFR pathway is aberrant in a majority
of patients with NSCLC, secondary to receptor overexpression, mutation, or gene amplification. Therefore,
inhibition of the EGFR pathway has emerged as an
important strategy to treat NSCLC. Cetuximab, as a
single agent, has demonstrated activity in patients
with recurrent and advanced NSCLC. In a phase 2
study of patients with refractory NSCLC, cetuximab
monotherapy resulted in a response rate of 4.5% and
disease stabilization in approximately 30% of
patients.10 Cetuximab potentiates the anticancer
effects of the platinum compounds and docetaxel in
the preclinical setting.11-14 Combination cisplatin
with cetuximab blocks activation of receptor tyrosine
kinase and induces EGFR down-regulation.13
The combination of carboplatin and docetaxel is
a commonly used regimen for the treatment of
patients with advanced-stage NSCLC. The efficacy of
this combination was established by a phase 3 study
that compared it with a standard regimen of cisplatin
and vinorelbine.15 There was comparable survival
reported between the 2 regimens and the overall
quality of life was found to be favorable with the use
of the combination of carboplatin and docetaxel.
Based on these factors, we conducted a phase 2
study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of cetuximab in combination with carboplatin and docetaxel
for patients with previously untreated advanced or
metastatic NSCLC.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
The primary objective of the current study was to
determine the objective response rate associated with
the combination of cetuximab, carboplatin, and docetaxel in patients with previously untreated advanced/
metastatic NSCLC. The secondary endpoints included
the determination of overall and progression-free survival and the assessment of toxicity associated with
the regimen. The study protocol was reviewed and

approved by the Institutional Review Board of each
participating institution. All patients provided written
informed consent to participate in the study.
The eligibility criteria were histologic/cytologic
confirmation of NSCLC; stage IIIB with pleural/pericardial effusion or stage IV disease; Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status
(PS) of 0 or 1; age 18 years; presence of measurable disease per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid
Tumors (RECIST) criteria; and willingness to provide
informed consent (graded according to the American Joint Committee on Cancer Staging System).
The qualifying laboratory criteria were hemoglobin
>9 g/dL, an absolute neutrophil count 1500/lL,
platelet count 100,000/lL, serum total bilirubin
institutional upper limit of normal (ULN), serum
transaminases 2.5 3 ULN, and serum creatinine
ULN. Patients with serum creatinine levels ULN
were eligible if their estimated creatinine clearance
was 60 mL/minute/1.73 m2. The patients with
prior chemotherapy, untreated or unstable brain
metastasis, prior therapy with a known EGFR inhibitor, the presence of severe comorbid illness,
peripheral neuropathy >grade 1, and known hypersensitivity to docetaxel or other drugs formulated
with polysorbate 80 were excluded. At least 2 weeks
should have elapsed since any prior radiotherapy
before study entry.

Treatment Plan
Cetuximab was administered weekly at a dose of 250
mg/m2 (1-hour infusion) after an initial loading dose
of 400 mg/m2 (2-hours infusion) on Week 1. After the
cetuximab infusion, docetaxel and carboplatin were
administered intravenously on Day 1 of each treatment cycle. Docetaxel was administered at a dose of
75 mg/m2 (1-hour infusion). Carboplatin was dosed to
achieve an area under the concentration versus time
curve (AUC) of 6 mg/mL and was infused over 30 minutes. The dose was calculated using the Calvert formula and the creatinine clearance was estimated by
the Cockroft-Gault formula.16 The premedication regimen included dexamethasone (administered orally at
a dose of 8 mg twice daily for 3 days), 5-HT3 antagonist, and diphenhydramine. During the maintenance
phase, premedication for cetuximab consisted of
diphenhydramine (50 mg intravenously) or a therapeutically equivalent histamine receptor inhibitor
before each dose. The treatment cycles were repeated
every 3 weeks. Chemotherapy was administered for a
maximum of 6 cycles. The patients who achieved an
objective response or disease stabilization after 6
cycles of therapy were treated with cetuximab monotherapy for up to 1 year. During the maintenance

phase, 4 weeks of therapy with cetuximab constituted
1 treatment cycle. The treatment cycles were discontinued earlier in the event of disease progression,
unacceptable toxicity, or withdrawal of informed consent. Granulocyte-colony–stimulating factor was not
allowed during the first cycle of therapy, but was
allowed during subsequent cycles according to institutional guidelines.

Patient Evaluation and Response Assessment
The pretreatment evaluations consisted of history
and physical examination, assessment of PS, complete blood count (CBC), and hepatic and renal function tests. A baseline electrocardiogram was obtained
if clinically indicated. Women of reproductive age
underwent a serum pregnancy test. During the combination therapy phase, patients underwent weekly
toxicity and PS assessment and determination of
CBC. The serum chemistry panel was obtained during the initiation of each new cycle. For the maintenance phase, toxicity evaluation was performed
every week and PS, CBC, and serum chemistry were
assessed every 6 weeks. The radiologic studies were
performed after every 2 cycles of therapy during the
combination therapy phase. History and physical examination and assessment of PS were performed
before the initiation of each new cycle. The
responses were assessed with RECIST criteria.17
Toxicity was assessed using the National Cancer
Institute Common Toxicity Criteria (version 3.0).
Mild to moderate infusion reactions with cetuximab
were managed by slowing the infusion rate and with
antihistamine therapy. Grade 3 or 4 infusion reactions led to permanent discontinuation of cetuximab
infusion. The skin reactions were managed with supportive care measures such as topical corticosteroids
and antibiotics for mild to moderate reactions. Dose
reductions by 50 mg/m2 decrements were done for
grade 3/4 skin rashes. Docetaxel was reduced to 60
mg/m2 (dose level 21) and then to 50 mg/m2 (dose
level 22) for each instance of dose reduction. The
dose of carboplatin was reduced by decrement of
AUC 5 1 mg/mL for each level of dose reduction. No
more than 2 dose reductions were allowed for each
patient. The dose of carboplatin was reduced by 1
dose level for grade 3/4 thrombocytopenia and docetaxel was reduced for grade 3/4 neutropenia. For
other grade 3 or 4 toxicities, the dose of the drug attributable to the event was reduced by 1 dose level.

dence interval was computed for the response rate.
The estimates of the median progression-free survival and the median survival, along with corresponding 95% confidence intervals, were calculated
using the Kaplan-Meier product-limit method. Toxicity was summarized and reported as worst grade per
subject.

RESULTS
A total of 80 patients were enrolled to the study over
a period of 18 months. The patient baseline characteristics are outlined in Table 1. The median age was
63 years and 36 patients (45%) were aged 65 years.
Women accounted for 47% of the study population.
The majority of the patients had stage IV disease.
White patients represented 80% of the study population, whereas African Americans accounted for 16%.
Five patients had received prior radiotherapy and 2
had prior surgical intervention. Seventy-four patients
had no prior therapeutic intervention for NSCLC.
A median of 4 cycles of combination therapy
was administered (range, 1-6 cycles). The median
dose of carboplatin and docetaxel was 5.6 (AUC) and
74.7 mg/m2, respectively. Twenty-five patients received maintenance therapy with cetuximab for a
median of 2 cycles (range, 1-7 cycles). The treatment
was discontinued in 50 patients because of disease
progression and in 16 patients because of adverse
events. The majority of the adverse events noted in
the 16 patients were primarily related to the disease
rather than therapy. In 6 patients, the physician discontinued therapy because of symptomatic progression of disease without radiologic confirmation. Six

were lost to follow-up.

Toxicity
The adverse events were assessed from the date of
first dose until 30 days after the end of therapy. During the combination therapy phase, hematologic
toxicities were the most commonly reported events.
Grade 3/4 neutropenia was noted in 24 (30%)
patients, although it was associated with fever in
only 4 (5%) patients. One patient experienced grade
4 hypersensitivity reaction during cetuximab infusion. Acneiform rash was noted in 29 (36%) patients
during the combination therapy phase, although only
3 patients had grade 3 severity. Grades 1 and 2 fatigue was noted in 14 and 17 patients, respectively,
during the combination therapy phase. The maintenance therapy was well tolerated. The majority of the
toxicities were of grade 1 or 2 severity with the
exception of skin rash. Four patients had grade 3
skin toxicity with cetuximab monotherapy. The toxicity data are summarized in Table 2.
Efficacy
Seventy-nine patients were evaluable for assessment
of response to therapy (Table 3). One patient
achieved a complete response and 11 achieved partial responses; the overall response rate was 15%.
Disease stabilization was achieved in 18 (23%)
patients. In 5 (28%) patients, disease stabilization
lasted for 6 months. Response assessments were

incomplete in 6 patients and the available information was inadequate to make a determination in 8
patients. Thirty-five patients (44%) had progressive
disease. The median progression-free survival was
4.6 months and 4 patients (14%) remained free of
disease progression at 12 months (Fig. 1A). The median survival and 1-year survival rate were 10.3
months and 36%, respectively. The 2-year survival
rate was 16% (Fig. 1B).

DISCUSSION
An efficacy plateau has been noted with various platinum-based regimens for the treatment of advanced
NSCLC. Therefore, combinations of molecularly targeted agents with standard chemotherapy are undergoing rigorous evaluation in this disease. The results
of the current study demonstrate the feasibility and
safety of combining cetuximab with the regimen of
carboplatin and docetaxel for patients with advanced
or metastatic NSCLC. Although the response rate was
low, the median progression-free survival and overall
survival are promising in this patient population. In
addition, the current study also documented the
ability to administer single-agent cetuximab as maintenance therapy after 6 cycles of chemotherapy in
combination with cetuximab. The study was conducted in multicenter community-based practices
and therefore provides the opportunity to interpret
these results as being valid in the ‘real world’ setting.
To our knowledge, this is the largest phase 2, singlearm study to date that has evaluated cetuximab in
combination with platinum-based, 2-drug chemotherapy regimens in the first-line treatment of
patients with advanced NSCLC.18-20 In contrast to
EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors, the monoclonal
antibodies against EGFR appear to be more suited
for combinations with chemotherapy, based on data
from recent randomized studies.21,22 A randomized
phase 2 study of cisplatin and vinorelbine with or
without cetuximab demonstrated higher response
rates and overall survival in favor of cetuximab-based

therapy.18 Another randomized study that compared
treatment with platinum/gemcitabine with or without cetuximab also demonstrated a higher response
rate and progression-free survival with the addition
of cetuximab.23
The results of the current phase 2 studies have
now been verified by 2 phase 3 studies that have
been reported since the completion of our phase 2
study. Lynch et al24 randomized patients with
advanced NSCLC to treatment with a combination of
carboplatin and taxane alone or in combination with
cetuximab. Although the response rate was higher
with the addition of cetuximab, no superiority was
noted in progression-free survival. However, a subset
analysis demonstrated improved progression-free
survival for patients who received the combination
of carboplatin, docetaxel, and cetuximab over the
same chemotherapy alone. We are currently awaiting
the survival data from this study. Similar to the phase
2 study reported herein, the study by Lynch et al did
not use any molecular markers for patient selection
for their trial. In contrast, a study by Pirker et al25
treated EGFR-expressing NSCLC patients (by immu-

nohistochemistry) with the combination of cisplatin
and vinorelbine alone or in combination with cetuximab. That phase 3 study demonstrated an improvement in overall survival (11.3 months vs 10.1
months; P 5 .044) and response rate with the addition of cetuximab to chemotherapy, although the
progression-free survival was found to be similar
between the 2 arms. It is premature to conclude that
molecular selection alone played a role in the positive results of the FLEX study,25 but the use of these
novel agents in enriched patient populations is
highly desirable.
Other molecular markers for patient selection for
cetuximab-based therapy are also being evaluated by
ongoing studies. In a recent study conducted by the
Southwest Oncology Group,26 patients with advanced
NSCLC were treated with carboplatin and paclitaxel
in combination with either the concurrent or sequential administration of cetuximab. The median
survival was 11 months for both the concurrent and
sequential approaches. However, patients whose tumor tissues had a higher EGFR gene copy number
had a median survival of 16 months, compared with
8 months in patients with low EGFR gene copy numbers. This demonstrates the feasibility of using molecular markers to select patients for therapy with
the novel cetuximab-based combination therapy and
may provide evidence supporting a difference
between monoclonal antibodies and small-molecule
tyrosine kinase inhibitors in this disease. The lack of
information regarding the relevant molecular markers on patient tumor specimens is a limitation of
the current study. In addition to gene amplification,
certain mutations in the EGFR gene have also been
linked with sensitivity to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors.27 To our knowledge, the clinical impact of the
presence of EGFR mutation on the efficacy of therapy
with cetuximab-based combinations or monotherapy
has not been adequately studied and represents
another important area of future investigation.
In summary, the combination of cetuximab with
chemotherapy represents a novel strategy for the
treatment of patients with advanced NSCLC. The
regimen of carboplatin and docetaxel is a welltolerated platform for the addition of cetuximab for
patients with previously untreated advanced/metastatic
NSCLC.
