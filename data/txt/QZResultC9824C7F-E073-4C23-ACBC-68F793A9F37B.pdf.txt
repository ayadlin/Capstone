ABSTRACT
Telomere and Telomerase have recently been explored as anti-aging and anticancer drug targets with only limited success. Previously we showed that the Chinese
herbal medicine Tianshengyuan-1 (TSY-1), an agent used to treat bone marrow
deficiency, has a profound effect on stimulating Telomerase activity in hematopoietic
cells. Here, the mechanism of TSY-1 on cellular Telomerase activity was further
investigated using HL60, a promyelocytic leukemia cell line, normal peripheral blood
mononuclear cells, and CD34+ hematopoietic stem cells derived from umbilical cord
blood. TSY-1 increases Telomerase activity in normal peripheral blood mononuclear
cells and CD34+ hematopoietic stem cells with innately low Telomerase activity but
decreases Telomerase activity in HL60 cells with high intrinsic Telomerase activity,
both in a dose-response manner. Gene profiling analysis identified Telomerase reverse
transcriptase (TERT) as the potential target gene associated with the TSY-1 effect,
which was verified by both RT-PCR and western blot analysis. The β-galactosidase
reporter staining assay showed that the effect of TSY-1 on Telomerase activity
correlates with cell senescence. TSY-1 induced hypomethylation within TERT core
promoter in HL60 cells but induced hypermethylation within TERT core promoter
in normal peripheral blood mononuclear cells and CD34+ hematopoietic stem cells.
TSY-1 appears to affect the Telomerase activity in different cell lines differently and
the effect is associated with TERT expression, possibly via the methylation of TERT
promoter.

length. Earlier studies demonstrated that over 80% of all
cancer types showed increased Telomerase activity and
hence, increased Telomere length in cancer cells over
their normal cell counterparts [1]. This together with
activating oncogenes / deactivating tumor suppressor
genes result in the dysregulation of tumor cell growth and
proliferation [2, 3]. Due to its significant role in cancer
biology, a considerable amount of effort has been devoted
to developing specific inhibitors of Telomerase activities
in order to develop targeted anti-cancer drugs. Thus far,

INTRODUCTION
Over the past two decades, there has been intense
interest in the study of the regulation of Telomerase, which
is an RNA-dependent DNA polymerase. Telomerase
contains a short RNA template complementary to
the DNA Telomere sequence, as well as a catalytic
protein with Telomerase reverse transcriptase activity.
Telomerase is responsible for maintaining Telomere

these efforts have resulted in only limited success. This is
partly due to the fact that cellular Telomerase homeostasis,
including Telomerase activity and Telomere length,
is regulated by a complex network of genes that have
interconnected signals.
On the contrary, there have also been attempts
to develop approaches to increase cellular Telomerase
activity, as an auspicious anti-aging strategy [4, 5], or as
a counteractive measure for some disease conditions such
as bone marrow failure that are associated with decreased
Telomerase activity. In fact, aplastic anemia (AA), the
most severe form of bone marrow failure, is found to
have a mutated telomerase gene resulting in the loss of
Telomerase activity in hematopoietic cells in about one
third of all cases. Even in those AA cases without the
telomerase gene mutation and in cases of myelodysplastic
syndrome (MDS), another form of severe bone marrow
deficiency, decreased Telomerase activity in hematopoietic
cells has also been seen [6–8].
Therefore, it seems that any efforts to target
Telomerase activity, by either inhibition or stimulation,
should be carefully tailored to an individual organ, system
or cell type. Also agents that regulate the homeostasis
of Telomerase activity may be superior to agents that
drive the activity in only one direction, which may result
in untoward side effects. In this study, we found that a
Chinese herbal medicine, TSY-1, has a property that
regulates Telomerase homeostasis. TSY-1 has been used to
treat patients with AA for many years with some success,
though definitive clinical trial data is not available at this
time. Previously, two in vivo bone marrow deficiency
mouse models, one induced with chemicals and the other
induced with immune-suppression and radiation treatment,
have both demonstrated strong bone marrow recovery
after TSY-1 treatment. These studies appeared to reflect
an effect of TSY-1 on modulating endogenous Telomerase
activity [9–12]. Our current study demonstrated that TSY1 has profound effects on maintaining the homeostasis of
Telomerase activity: it inhibits the Telomerase activity in
cancerous HL60 cells, which has high intrinsic Telomerase
activity, whereas it increases Telomerase activity in normal
peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and CD34+
hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) derived from umbilical
cord blood. Further, we demonstrated that such effects
are associated with the epigenetic regulation of TERT
promoter region.

cells, we chose human leukemia cells HL60, which was
known to have high intrinsic Telomerase activity [12],
and healthy donor-derived human PBMCs as well as
core blood CD34+ HSCs with low intrinsic Telomerase
activity. The effect of TSY-1 on Telomerase activity was
tested using a quantitative telomeric repeat amplification
PCR assay. Treatment cells were treated with 31.2 μg/ml
and 62.5 μg/ml of TSY-1 drug for 24 hours and compared
to the untreated control cells. As represented in Figure 1,
we detected strong innate Telomerase activity in HL60
cells. With the treatment of TSY-1, the Telomerase
activity decreased significantly in HL60 cells. However,
TSY-1 treatment increased Telomerase activity in PBMCs
and HSCs compared to the untreated control. Both of
the changes (decreased Telomerase activity in HL60
and increased Telomerase activity in PBMCs and HSCs)
showed a dose-response relationship. Taken together,
these data confirm that TSY-1 has an opposite effect on
leukemia cells with intrinsically high Telomerase activities
(inhibitory) and normal blood mononuclear and stem cells
with low Telomerase activities (stimulatory).

TERT was identified as a target gene for
TSY-1 activity
The differential effect of TSY-1 on Telomerase
activity in these cell models provided opportunities to
identify potential target genes associated with TSY-1
activity (Figure 2). Using Affymetrix GeneChip Human
Transcriptome Array system, we screened the entire
genome in order to identify potential target genes that are
associated with TSY-1-induced Telomerase modulation.
The heat maps in Figure 3 demonstrate that both HL60
cells and PBMCs treated with TSY-1 62.5 μg/ml had
a greater difference in gene expression compared to
their untreated control cells. A total of 764 genes were
differentially expressed between HL60 control cells
and TSY-1 62.5 μg/ml treated cells, and 501 genes were
differentially expressed between control PBMCs and TSY1 62.5 μg/ml treated cells. TERT gene expression showed
an opposite fold change after TSY treatment between
HL60 cells and PBMCs (-1.82 VS 1.21), similar to the
change pattern of Telomerase activity observed above.
We then further identified genes that showed opposite
expression patterns between HL60 cells versus PBMCs
as well as HSCs, focusing on Telomere-associated
genes. We performed a human Telomeres & Telomerase
RT² profiler™ PCR array analysis, which profiled the
expression of 84 key genes central to Telomere replication,
maintenance, regulation and Telomere-associated
complexes. The results were shown in Table 1. The gene
target that showed the most prominently differential effect
between HL60 (down regulation) and PBMCs / HSCs (up
regulation) is, again, the TERT gene.
To verify this result, a qPCR analysis was performed
on TERT gene expression in three cell lines with and

without TSY-1 treatment. As shown in Figure 3, our results
confirmed that TSY-1 had an opposite effect on TERT
gene expression between HL60 cells and PBMCs / HSCs.
The 62.5 μg/ml concentration of TSY-1 drug had the
maximum effect on TERT gene expression. Western blot
combined with immunoprecipitation showed that TERT
protein level in HL60 cells decreased significantly after
TSY-1 treatment by a dose-dependent manner. In contrast,
TERT protein level was elevated in treated PBMCs and
HSCs compared with the untreated controls, although
no significant difference existed between the control and
treated HSCs (Figure 3). Therefore, in corroboration with
the results from the Telomerase activity assays, it seems
that the effect of TSY-1 on Telomerase activity may be
mediated by TERT gene expression.

the number of healthy PBMCs and HSCs increased. After
treatment, the dark blue staining became larger and denser,
and the percentage of labeling cells also increased in HL60
cells but not in PBMCs and HSCs (Figure 4).

Demethylation / hypermethylation within TERT
promoter positively related to gene expression
after TSY-1 treatment
Transcriptional regulation is a critical process
to control TERT gene expression. In this study, the
TERT gene expression changed within 24 hours, which
underlines the possible role of transcriptional regulation.
To confirm this, we focused on the epigenetic regulation
within TERT core promoter region. Previous studies have
chosen different regions of TERT promoter to explore the
epigenetic regulation. Pettigrew et al. reported differential
TERT promoter methylation and response to Decitabine
in 20 CpG sites in acute myeloid leukemia cell lines [13].
We amplified a 185bp DNA fragment through bisulfite
specific PCR. Then, through pyrosequencing, we analyzed
the methylation patterns of 22 CpG sites in a region
spanning 143bp (Figure 5A). Among the 3 untreated cell
lines, the methylation levels of all 22 CpG sites in HL60
cells were remarkably higher than those of PBMCs and
HSCs. The percentage of methylation in each CpG site

TSY-1 treatment induced cell senescence in
HL60 cells but not in PBMCs and HSCs
Cell populations that stop growing can exhibit
markers of senescence, including senescence-associated
β-galactosidase staining. Cells stained dark blue are
considered senescent cells, because the β-galactosidase
activity was detected. Under the microscope field,
we found that the total number of healthy HL60 cells
significantly decreased after TSY-1 treatment, whereas

telomerase activity using TRAP. Telomerase is a heat-sensitive enzyme. As a negative control, every sample extract to be evaluated was
also tested for heat sensitivity. Thus, analysis of each sample consists of two assays: one with a test extract and one with a heat-treated
test extract. Gel pictures showed that TSY-1 treatment decreased telomerase activity in HL60 cells but increased telomerase activity in
PBMCs and HSCs. * P < 0.05, compared to untreated control, t-test. PBMC: normal peripheral blood mononuclear cells, HSCs: CD34+

gradually declined from upstream towards downstream
(Figure 5B). Demethylation in HL60 cells (16 sites) and
hypermethylation in PBMCs (17 sites) / HSCs (22 sites)
that TSY-1 treatment induced were observed in a doseresponse manner. In particular, 12 sites showed an opposite
methylation pattern between HL60 cells (downregulated)
and PBMCs / HSCs (upregulated), which were associated
with concomitant decrease of TERT expression in HL60
cells and increase of TERT expression in PBMCs and
HSCs (Figure 5C). Most of these sites were located in
the hypomethylated downstream area. Among these 3
cell lines, we also observed that the most prominent
differential effect of TSY-1 treatment on methylation was
in HSCs.

and promote chromosomal instability [16, 17]. This
complex activating/repressive process makes it difficult
to use Telomerase activator/inhibitor as a single target to
regulate the cell growth and cancer development alone.
Furthermore, as Telomerase inhibition may result in the
inhibition of normal functions, especially hematopoietic
stem cell functions, such a strategy may result in untoward
side effects. Myelosuppression, anemia, neutropenia and
thrombocytopenia have been commonly observed with the
findings of recent clinical trials [18–20].
Likewise, because there are disease conditions that
are associated with decreased or abnormal Telomerase
function, some also attempt to develop approaches to
increase Telomerase activity as an anti-aging strategy.
Currently, the most studied method to extend Telomere
is viral delivery [5]. Recently, Ramunas et al. delivered
modified mRNA encoding TERT to human fibroblasts
and myoblasts and found that this delivery could extend
Telomeres rapidly and increase cell proliferation [21].
However, as exciting as the above target approaches
may be, in theory, one may expect untoward side effects
with such one directional approaches [22]. Application
of Telomerase inhibitors in cancer patients may result in
inhibition of bone marrow, whereas increased Telomerase
activity may cause cell immortalization and promote
carcinogenesis. The findings of increasing cancer risk
from previous studies in animal models make Telomerase
activators difficult to justify for their use in clinical
practice [23–25].
TSY-1, a Chinese herb regimen, is rather unique.
Our study shows that at least in hematopoietic cells, it
has an effect of maintaining Telomerase homeostasis,
i.e., inhibits Telomerase activity in intrinsically high

DISCUSSION
More than 80% of cancers have increased
Telomerase activity [1], and Telomerase has served as
an attractive target for anti-cancer drug development.
Strategies
including
antisense
oligonucleotide
inhibitors, small molecular inhibitors, Telomerase-based
immunotherapies and Telomerase-based oncolytic gene
therapies have been explored [14, 15]. Clinical studies
showed that when combining anti-Telomerase treatment
with traditional therapies such as chemotherapy or
radiotherapy, some success has been achieved. However,
the overall benefit is rather limited. Part of the reasons
may be due to the fact that Telomerase activity is rather
dynamic and may be multi-directional during the course
of cancer progression. It has been observed that shortened
Telomeres not only limit the proliferative potential but
also can be associated with increased tumor initiation,

expression malignant HL60 cells, whereas increases
Telomerase activity in normal PBMCs and HSCs in a
dose-response manner. Unlike most Chinese medicine,
which is typically prepared by boiling, TSY-1 is extracted
through a distillation process of multiple Chinese
herbs: almond, pericarpium citri reticulatae viride,
mangnolia officinalis, frankincense, and schisandra
chinensis. Although it is difficult to identify a single
effective constituent from multi-herbs, the standardized
preparation can ensure consistencies with respect to

concentration of active ingredients [26]. Recent studies
utilizing mouse-models with both chemical-induced and
radiation-induced bone marrow failure showed that the
mice with bone marrow failure treated with TSY-1 had
significant recovery of hematopoietic cells in both bone
marrow and peripheral blood. In addition, TSY-1 induces
extramedullary hematopoiesis in multiple organ systems
including both liver and spleen and also specifically
increases the number of CD4+/CD8- T cells and CD34+
cells (9, 10).

control and HL60 TSY-1 treatment. To generate the heat map, the data from all 6 samples is used to generate a standardized mean of 0 and
a standard deviation of 1. Each sample is then compared to this mean to determine up or downregulation of the gene. The map shows that
HL60 control and HL60 TSY-1 62.5 μg/ml are very different in gene expression. Note that PBMC control is very different (almost like
opposites) compared to HL60 control. This indicates that a different set of genes are differentially expressed in the PBMCs. B. up- and

HL60 control.

The gene target that shows the most prominent differential effect between HL-60 (down regulation) and PBMCs / HSCs
(up regulation) is TERT gene. Others (ACD, BLM, ATP5C1, BLM, CDK2, ERCC4, HAT1, HNRNPD, HSP90A1,
MRE11A, PPP2R1A, PTGES3, RAD17, RTEL1, SART1, and SSB), have the same direction, but with minimal effect
(mostly <2-fold change). PBMC: normal peripheral blood mononuclear cells, HSCs: CD34+ hematopoietic stem cells.

TSY-1 has been used in China for many years to
treat AA and MDS. It is not until recently that studies
have shown that bone marrow deficiency of MDS and
AA are associated with Telomerase abnormality, whereas
about one-third of congenital AA harbors mutations of the
TERT gene resulted in loss of Telomerase activity [27]. In
our previous study, we found that TSY-1 has the ability to
recover bone marrow deficiency in in vivo animal model
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

studies [12], and such an effect is associated with the
Telomerase activity. Time course experiment on cultured
cell lines showed the effect can be seen within 6-hour
treatment. But we have not tested the effect of TSY-1 on
Telomerase activity after removal of the TSY-1 treatment.
It has been shown that a number of compounds can
induce changes of Telomerase activity [28]. For example,
hormones such as estrogen and testosterone and some

growth factors increase the Telomerase activity, whereas
differentiation agents such as retinoic acid have opposite
effect. We previously tested granulocyte-macrophage
colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), a growth factor
stimulating hematopoietic cell proliferation and
differentiation, which did not show effects on Telomerase
activity when used alone (data not shown). Similar result
was reported by others [29]. It should be noted that we
used different batch of TSY-1 in the current study with the
crude drug concentration of 0.62 g/ml, which was twice
higher than what was used in the previous study (0.31 g/
ml) [12]. Therefore, we used higher dilutions in the current
study whereas the final effective concentrations of TSY-1
drug were similar.
By comparing global gene expression patterns
of HL60, PBMCs and HSCs, we identified that the
potential target gene of TSY-1 activity is the TERT gene.
TERT is the major regulatory component of Telomerase
activity [30]. Our results of TERT gene expression were
consistent with the changes of Telomerase activity, which
were further proved by the western blot analysis on TERT
protein expression. Our β-galactosidase staining showed
a distinctive change of cell senescence between HL60

and PBMCs / HSCs. More studies are still needed to
determine whether these changes were directly modulated
by TERT expression [31–34]. It is worth noting that we
see a significant reduction of cell proliferation in HL60
cells but not in PBMCs and HSCs, further supporting the
inhibiting effect of TSY-1 on human leukemia cells.
The observed modulating effect of TSY-1 on
Telomerase activity in different cell systems suggests
that TSY-1 may regulate Telomerase activity through
epigenetic mechanisms, probably through TERT. Indeed,
TERT core promoter contains abundant CpG sites. Several
important transcription binding sites have also been
identified [35–37]. E-box (located at -165 and +44 region)
is considered as a binding site that can interact with Myc
family oncogenes and may activate TERT transcription
[38, 39]. GC boxes are other important binding sites for
zinc finger transcription factor Sp1, which may contribute
in maintaining the activity of the TERT promoter[40].
Generally, it is recognized that methylation of the CpG
sites in the promoter region will inhibit transcription and
result in gene silencing [41]. However, in terms of the
TERT promoter, the examination of methylation status of
CpG sites and TERT expression are rather controversial

Figure 4: Effects of TSY-1 on beta-galactosidase labeling in HL60 cells, PBMCs and HSCs. Cells were harvested and
fixed, followed by cytospin and staining with senescence beta-galactosidase staining kit. Remarkably, the total number of healthy HL60
cells decreased after TSY-1 treatment, which did not happen in PBMCs and HSCs. The histogram shows the percentage of labeling cells
following TSY-1 treatment increased in HL60 cells but decreased in PBMCs and HSCs. * P < 0.05, compared to untreated control, t-test.

[42, 43]. Recently, studies indicated hypermethylation
of the TERT promoter ubiquitously exists in highly
proliferative cancer cells and correlates with increased
Telomerase activity. On the contrary, many low
proliferative normal cells demonstrate a hypomethylation
in the TERT promoter region with decreased Telomerase
activity [44].
We analyzed 22 CpG sites within the TERT core
promoter region through pyrosequencing and found that
Leukemia cell line HL60 demonstrated a significant
hypermethylation within the TERT promoter compared to
that of normal blood cells PBMCs and HSCs, supporting
a positive relationship between hypermethylation in TERT
promoter and Telomerase activity. After treatment, multiple
CpG sites show changes of methylation percentage in
parallel with TERT expression. This intriguing finding
provides the foundation for the hypothesis that TSY-1 may
exert the effect of maintaining homeostasis of Telomerase
activity by epigenetic regulation. Yet more in-depth studies
are still needed to elucidate exactly how TSY-1 affects the
CpG island methylation. Further, it will be interesting to
compare the effects of TSY-1 on TERT expression with
other Telomerase inhibitors and activators, and also study
the effect of TSY-1 on carcinogenesis.
In summary, TSY-1 appears to affect the Telomerase
activity in different cell lines differently: inhibits
Telomerase activity in intrinsically Telomerase-high
leukemic HL60 cells but increases Telomerase activity in
innately Telomerase-low normal PBMCs and HSCs. This
effect appears to be mediated by methylation of the TERT
promoter. The strategy of maintaining the homeostasis
of Telomerase activity may have significant impact in
developing approaches for Telomerase-based target
treatment of bone marrow deficiency and cancer. Whether
such an effect relates to the potential clinical benefit for
patients remains to be tested in further studies.

lines, medium was replaced every 2 to 3 days depending
on cell density, which was maintained around 1 × 106
viable cells/ml before TSY-1 treatment.
TSY-1 liquid of 10ml/vial, batch No. YZ130506,
with a content of crude drug of 0.62 g/ml, with the
purified drug concentration of 1mg/ml, was provided by
Beijing Boyuantaihe Biological Technology Co., Ltd.
The cultured cells were treated with 1/32 (31.2 μg/ml)
and l/16 (62.5 μg/ml) dilutions of TSY-1 stock solution,
which was determined by previous cell proliferation
assay, for 24 hours prior to harvesting for the analysis
of Telomerase activity and TERT expression. While the
actual active ingredient(s) is not known at the moment, gas
chromatography analysis has performed and identified a
main peak that remains to be characterized. Cells cultured
in medium treated with 0.01% Tween solution (the solvent
of TSY-1 drug) were served as a TSY-1 untreated control.
Enzymatic activity was detected by the PCR-based
telomeric repeat amplification protocol (TRAP), using the
Quantitative Telomerase Detection Kit and following the
manufacturer’s instructions (US Biomax). As a negative
control, every sample extract to be evaluated was also
tested for heat sensitivity. Heat treatment was performed
by incubating samples at 85°C for 10 minutes prior to the
Telomerase activity assay. A dilution series of TSR control
template was prepared in lysis buffer to serve as a standard
curve. PCR was set at: 35 cycles of 94°C 30 s, 59°C 30
s and 72°C 30 s. The quantity of Telomerase substrate
produced in each well was determined from a linear plot
of the log10 of the quantities of the TSR control template
standards versus the Ct values for their wells. Telomerase
activity was determined as the relative ratios of the mean
quantity of Telomerase substrate in each TSY treated
sample to the mean quantity of Telomerase substrate in
the untreated control sample. PCR products were also run
on a 10% polyacrylamide gel in TBE stained with SYBR
Gold Nucleic Acid Gel Stain.

Cell culture, treatment and Telomerase
activity assay

Total RNA was extracted and purified from HL60,
PBMCs and HSCs using an RNeasy Miniprep Kit
(Qiagen). The effect of TSY-1 on gene expression profiles
of HL60 cells and PBMCs was tested using the Affymetrix
GeneChip® Human Transcriptome Array (HTA) 2.0
system. Total RNA samples were submitted to the UCLA
Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine
Clinical Microarray Core for processing. The Affymetrix
WT PLUS Reagent Kit was used to prepare the RNA for
hybridization to the HTA. Data analysis was performed
using the Affymetrix Expression Console software and
Transcriptome Analysis Console software. The Human
Telomeres & Telomerase RT² Profiler PCR Array was
also used for the analysis of Telomere-associated gene
expression (Qiagen).

Human leukemia cells HL60 were obtained from
American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, USA)
and grown in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle’s Medium
(DMEM) containing 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum
(FBS) and 1% (v/v) streptomycin/penicillin (S/P). The
human normal PBMCs and core blood derived CD34+
HSCs were isolated from healthy donors in the Center
for AIDS Research virology core laboratory (University
of California, Los Angeles). PBMCs were suspended in
RPMI 1640 with 10% Human Serum AB. HSCs cells
were grown in StemPro-34 Medium containing nutrient
supplement, L-Glutamine (2mM), cytokines SCF (100 ng/
mL), IL-3 (50 ng/mL) and GM-CSF (25 ng/mL). These
cells were maintained at 37.0°C with 5% CO2. For all cell

TERT gene expression between control and
TSY-1 treated samples was verified via qPCR using
iTaq Universal SYBR Green Supermix (BIO-RAD) in
iCycler iQ™ Real-Time PCR Detection System (BIORAD). Reverse transcription reaction was set at 42 °C
for 90 min and inactivation at 85 °C for 5 min, followed
by the cDNA amplification reaction: 95 °C 5min, 40
cycles of 95 °C for 30 s, 59 °C for 30 s and 72 °C for
45 s in 20μl reaction mixtures. Data acquisition was
set at the chain extension step and the melt curve data
collection analysis was performed between 55 and
95°C, with 0.5°C increments. Forward primer was
5'-GAGCTGACGTGGAAGATGAG-3' and reverse
primer was 5'-CAGGATCTCCTCACGCAGAC-3'. Betaactin was served as a reference gene for each triplicate
set of reaction repeated three times. Results shown here
are the mean normalized values of cDNA levels with the
reference gene.

forward primer 5’-gttggcgtttttgtattttgg-3’, reverse
primer 5’-gaatacccgaatccccaat-3’. For the purpose of
pyrosequencing, the primers were HPLC purified and the
end of the reverse primer was biotin labeled. The PCR
reaction mixture is 50 μl in volume, containing 25 μl 2X
iTaq™ universal SYBR® Green supermix (BIO-RAD)
with 200nM on each primer and 150ng of genomic DNA.
PCR conditions used for the amplification were 95°C for
3 min; 50 cycles of 95°C for 15 s, 60°C for 30 s and 72°C
for 30 s. 2 μl of PCR product was run on 2% agarose gel in
TBE stained with SYBR Gold Nucleic Acid Gel Stain. The
remaining product was used for pyrosequencing. The three
sequencing primers were as follows: 5’-tttttgtattttgggag-3’,
5’-aagygyggtttagatt-3’, and 5’-ggtttttagtggatt-3’. The
methylation percentage of each CpG site was presented
and analyzed in a heat map.

Western blot analysis

β-galactosidase stain was performed using a
senescence β-galactosidase staining kit (Cell signaling
Technology). All the cell lines were harvested and washed
with 1×PBS, and were then fixed overnight at room
temperature in fixative solution. We used cytospin to
make cell slides and then immediately covered the cells by
adding β-galactosidase staining solution on the slides. All
the slides were incubated at 37ºC (without CO2) overnight.
Positively stained cells (dark blue) were counted in at least
five microscopic fields with almost 500 counted cells. The
ratio of the stained cells to the total number of cells was
expressed as the percentage of senescent cells.

Senescence-associated β-galactosidase analysis

Protein immunoprecipitation combined with
Western blot was used to measure the expression of
TERT protein. The control and treated cells were lysed
in RIPA buffer. The extracts were incubated with human
TERT antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and 20 μl of
protein A/G Plus-Agarose (Santa Cruz Biotechnology).
After washing and boiling, the samples were centrifuged
to pellet the agarose beads, followed by SDS-PAGE
analysis of the supernatant. To ensure use of equal
amounts of protein per sample, blots were performed
before immunoprecipitation experiments using Betaactin. Cell protein extracts were resolved by SDS-PAGE
(8%). The proteins were transferred onto a nitrocellulose
membrane and immunoblotted with the primary antibody
(1:2000) and secondary antibody (1:5000). After extensive
washing, membranes were reacted with ECL detection
reagents immediately prior to autoradiography. The
relative levels of TERT protein were determined by
scanning densitometry.

Statistical analysis
Statistical analysis was performed using Microsoft
Excel (Microsoft, Redmond, WA, USA) and SAS version
9.2 software (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA.).
Continuous data was presented as means plus/minus the
standard deviation (±SD) and compared with the Student’s
t-test. Statistical significance was defined by a two-tailed
p-value of 0.05.

DNA extraction, bisulfite treatment and
methylation analysis

ACKNOWLEDGMENT

Genomic DNA was extracted from cells using the
QIAamp® DNA Mini Kit (Qiagen). After the Nanodrop
measured the concentration of DNA, the DNA stock
solution was stored at -80ºC until use. The extracted DNA
samples were bisulfite and were treated using the EpiTect
Bisulfite Kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer’s
protocol. The Human Methylated & Non-methylated DNA
Set (Zymo) was used to assess the efficiency of bisulfitemediated conversion of DNA.
To analyze the methylation in the TERT core
promoter region, we performed PCR of bisulfiteconverted DNA using the following primer pair:
