primary or acquired. Resistance to doxorubicin can occur by
several mechanisms, including alteration of Top2 expression or
activity (7), overexpression of classic and nonclassic pleiotropic
drug/multidrug resistance (PDR/MDR) proteins (8), detoxification
by glutathione transferase (9), and enhanced DNA repair (10). MDR
is the major contributor to clinical resistance to anthracyclines
identified to date, although evidence for the other mechanisms of
resistance is less clear. In addition, doxorubicin causes cardiotoxicity in patients that has been linked to doxorubicin-induced
generation of reactive oxygen species and the resulting damage to
mitochondrial DNA (11).
To gain further insight into the mechanisms of doxorubicin
resistance, we sought to identify additional genes and/or molecular
pathways that participate in doxorubicin cytotoxicity. We have
previously used a one-step selection method to screen the
collection of deletion mutants generated by the Yeast Genome
Deletion Project for nonessential genes that, when deleted, confer
cisplatin resistance (12). In that study, we found that some deletion
strains were cross-resistant to certain other cytotoxic agents,
including doxorubicin, but were hypersensitive to others. These
findings prompted us to screen for yeast mutants that are resistant
to doxorubicin. Here, we report the analysis of the most prevalent
pathway identified in the screen: the small ubiquitin-related
modifier (SUMO) pathway.
Like ubiquitin, SUMO functions by becoming attached to other
proteins as a post-translational modification. The SUMO family in
vertebrates includes three distinct proteins, SUMO-1, SUMO-2, and
SUMO-3, whereas Saccharomyces cerevisiae has a single SUMO
gene (SMT3; ref. 13). The enzymatic cascade for attaching SUMO
resembles the ubiquitin pathway but uses a distinct set of E1
(activation), E2 (conjugation), and E3 (ligation) enzymes (13). The
E1 for activating SUMO is a heterodimer of Aos1 and Uba2 (also
called Sae1-Sae2 in mammalian systems; ref. 13). Ubc9 is the only
E2 enzyme identified for SUMO (13). E3 ligases collaborate with
Ubc9 to confer substrate specificity on sumoylation. S. cerevisiae
contains four known SUMO E3s: Siz1, Siz2/Nfi1 (13), Mms21 (14),
and the meiotic E3 Zip3 (15). There are at least four types of SUMO
E3 ligases in mammalian cells: the protein inhibitors of activated
signal transducers and activators of transcription (PIAS) family,
the nucleoporin RanBP2/Nup358, the polycomb group protein Pc2,
and MMS21 (13, 16). Yeast Siz1 and Siz2 are members of the PIAS
family. Sumoylation is a reversible modification, and a family of
SUMO-specific proteases cleaves SUMO from protein conjugates
and also generates mature SUMO from SUMO precursors (13). The
SUMO-specific proteases in S. cerevisiae are ULP1 and ULP2/SMT4.
In S. cerevisiae, most of the genes (SMT3, AOS1, UBA2, UBC9,
MMS21, and ULP1) involved in sumoylation are essential for
viability, although SIZ1, SIZ2, and ULP2 are not. SUMO conjugation
is also required for viability of most other organisms (13, 17). The
essential function of SUMO in yeast is unknown, but sumoylation
has a variety of roles in maintaining genome integrity, including

Abstract
Development of drug resistance is a major challenge in cancer
chemotherapy using doxorubicin. By screening the collection
of Saccharomyces cerevisiae deletion strains to identify
doxorubicin-resistant mutants, we have discovered that the
small ubiquitin-related modifier (SUMO) pathway is a major
determinant of doxorubicin cytotoxicity in yeast. Mutants
lacking UBA2 (SUMO activating enzyme; E1), UBC9 (conjugating enzyme; E2), and ULP1 and ULP2 (desumoylation
peptidases) are all doxorubicin resistant, as are mutants
lacking MLP1, UIP3, and NUP60, which all interact with ULP1.
Most informatively, mutants lacking the SUMO E3 ligase
Siz1 are strongly doxorubicin resistant, whereas mutants of
other SUMO ligases are either weakly resistant (siz2) or hypersensitive (mms21) to doxorubicin. These results suggest that
doxorubicin cytotoxicity is regulated by Siz1-dependent sumoylation of specific proteins. Eliminating SUMO attachment
to proliferating cell nuclear antigen or topoisomerase II does
not affect doxorubicin cytotoxicity, whereas reducing SUMO
attachment to the bud neck–associated septin proteins has a
modest effect. Consistent with these results, doxorubicin
resistance in the siz1D strain does not seem to involve an
effect on DNA repair. Instead, siz1D cells accumulate lower
intracellular levels of doxorubicin than wild-type (WT) cells,
suggesting that they are defective in doxorubicin retention.
Although siz1D cells are cross-resistant to daunorubicin, they
are hypersensitive to cisplatin and show near WT sensitivity to
other drugs, suggesting that the siz1D mutation does not
cause a general multidrug resistance phenotype. Cumulatively,
these results reveal that SUMO modification of proteins mediates the doxorubicin cytotoxicity in yeast, at least partially,
by modification of septins and of proteins that control the
intracellular drug concentration. [Cancer Res 2007;67(2):765–72]

Introduction
The anthracycline doxorubicin is a topoisomerase II (Top2)
inhibitor (1) that also inhibits DNA and RNA synthesis (2, 3) and
produces ssDNA breaks (4, 5) and membrane damage (6). Doxorubicin is a major component of chemotherapy regimens for many
cancers, including solid tumors, leukemias, and lymphomas (2, 3).
However, the efficacy of doxorubicin-based regimens is compromised by the frequent occurrence of resistance, which can be either

Cell cycle analysis. Cells were fixed in 70% ethanol for at least 16 h at
4jC. Samples were then washed once with 1 mL of 50 mmol/L sodium
citrate (pH 7.5) and resuspended in 0.5 mL of 50 mmol/L sodium citrate.
Each sample was treated with 0.1 mg/mL RNase A for 16 h and 25 Ag/mL
proteinase K for 90 min at 37jC. After which, 0.5 mL of 50 mmol/L sodium
citrate containing 2 Amol/L Sytox Green (Invitrogen) was added. Samples
were sonicated and analyzed with a fluorescence-activated cell analyzer
(FACScan flow cytometer, Becton Dickinson, San Jose, CA). Fluorescenceactivated cell sorting (FACS) data were analyzed using WinList software
(Verity Software House, Topsham, ME).
Doxorubicin uptake and efflux analysis using flow cytometry. Drug
retention was assessed by comparing cellular drug content [mean
fluorescence intensity (MFI)] immediately following 1, 4, or 6 h of incubation.
Cells were washed with cold PBS and resuspended in PBS and analyzed on
a FACScan flow cytometer with 720 long pass (FL3) filter for emission
collection. Flow cytometry data were analyzed using WinList software. Drug
efflux assay was done after the 1-h treatment for 1- and 2-h drug efflux
periods in drug-free medium. The relative changes between the single
variable histogram distributions thus obtained were further quantified by
the Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistic, which produces D values ranging from
0 (no difference) to 1 (no overlap; ref. 22). D values of >0.2 were considered
significant as previously established for mammalian MDR models (23).
Immunoblotting. The levels of sumoylated proteins were assessed using
Western blotting as described previously (21). Briefly, cells were treated with
doxorubicin for 1 or 5 h and resuspended in NaOH/2-mercaptoethanol
buffer. Protein extracts were precipitated with equal volume of 50%
trichloroacetic acid and washed with ice-cold acetone. Proteins were then
dissolved in Tris-SDS buffer, resolved in 4% to 20% Bis-Tris PAGE gels, and
detected with a polyclonal antibody against yeast Smt3.

roles in DNA repair pathways, chromosome cohesion, nucleolar
and telomere structure, and recovery from checkpoint arrest
induced by DNA damage or DNA replication defects (13).
In our genome-wide doxorubicin resistance screen, the SIZ1
gene, which encodes a SUMO E3 ligase, was found most frequently.
Further analysis indicated that mutations of other genes in the
SUMO pathway, including the desumoylation enzymes, also confer
doxorubicin resistance. Our data suggest that the SUMO pathway
affects doxorubicin cytotoxicity at least partially through modification of septins as well as of proteins that control retention of
the drug.

Materials and Methods
Yeast strains and media. The individual yeast strains used in this study
are listed in Supplementary Table S1. Homozygous diploid deletion pool
strains and individual haploid deletion strains (MATa met15-1 his3-11,15
leu2-3,112 lys1-1 ura3-1) generated by the Saccharomyces Gene Deletion
Project (18) were obtained from Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA) or EUROSCARF
(Frankfurt, Germany). Standard yeast media and growth conditions were
used (19). Yeast cultures were seeded from single colonies grown on yeast
extract-peptone-dextrose (YPD) plates or synthetic defined yeast nitrogen
base medium (SDM) supplemented with appropriate amino acids for the
strain background at 25jC or 30jC.
Chemicals. Yeast nitrogen base, yeast extract, peptone, and dextrose
were purchased from Difco Laboratories (Detroit, MI). Doxorubicin,
daunorubicin, 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), camptothecin, etoposide and irinotecan, and cisplatin were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO) or LKB
Laboratory (St. Paul, MN). Stock solutions were prepared as follows.
Doxorubicin, daunorubicin, camptothecin, etoposide, and irinotecan were
in DMSO and 5-FU in water and were stored at 20jC. Cisplatin was
prepared in DMSO, stored as aliquots at 20jC (less than 2 weeks), and
further diluted in 0.9% NaCl before adding to the medium. All plates were
made in SDM or YPD and stored in the dark and used within 24 h. All other
chemicals are from Sigma-Aldrich.
High-throughput doxorubicin resistance screen. A one-step selection
method was used to screen the pool of deletion strains to isolate mutants
that grew on SDM plates containing high concentrations of doxorubicin as
described previously (12) and in Supplementary Materials and Methods.
Plasmids, overexpression, and gene replacements. For overexpression
of Smt3 gene, a pEMBL-yex4-SMT3 (pSMT3) plasmid, identical to that
described in (20) except lacking tags or empty vector, was transformed into
BY4741 and siz1D strains and induced in medium containing galactose.
For TOP2 allele replacement in wild-type (WT; JD52) and siz1D strains,
a 5,349-bp DraIII fragment from pCC117 (TOP2-HA-kanMX4) or pML251
(top2-SNM-HA-kanMX4; ref. 21), which was a gift of Dr. Stephen Elledge
(Harvard University, Cambridge, MA), was used for transformation. To
create the pdr5D siz1D and erg6D siz1D strains, a DNA fragment containing
the LEU2 marker flanked by upstream and downstream sequences of the
PDR5 or ERG6 open reading frame was PCR amplified using a plasmid
containing the LEU2 gene as a template. This fragment was transformed
into the siz1D strain (EUROSCARF), and the correct gene replacement was
verified by PCR of the genomic DNA isolated from the LEU2 + colonies.
Semiquantitative spot assay for doxorubicin cytotoxicity. Single
yeast colonies were picked and grown overnight in liquid YPD at 30jC or
25jC for temperature-sensitive mutant strains. Cultures were then diluted
to a concentration of 5  106 cells/mL, and additional 5-fold serial dilutions
were made. Each dilution (1 AL) was spotted onto YPD or SDM plates with
or without tested drugs and grown for 2 to 3 days at 30jC or 4 to 5 days at
25jC. The spot intensity at the second dilution for each strain was
determined using densitometric analysis (Alpha Imager, Alpha Innotech)
and divided by the spot intensity of the corresponding untreated cells to
determine the percentage survival. The fold resistance relative to the WT
parental cells was calculated using the percentage growth in each spot at a
drug concentration where the WT cells retained approximately 10% to 20%
survival unless otherwise indicated.

Results
Identification of SUMO pathway as a major determinant of
doxorubicin cytotoxicity. To identify yeast genes whose inactivation confers resistance to doxorubicin, we screened the mutant
collection from the Yeast Genome Deletion Project for strains that
are resistant to doxorubicin (see Materials and Methods). Of the
genes identified, the SIZ1 gene, encoding a SUMO E3 ligase, was
found most frequently (f16% of the colonies screened). Four other
genes functionally related to the SUMO pathway were also found in
the screen with a lower frequency (0.4–3%). These were the SIZ2
gene, which encodes another PIAS family E3 ligase, and three
genes, MLP1, NUP60, and UIP3, which encode proteins that interact
with the desumoylation enzyme Ulp1 (24, 25). The nucleoporin
Nup60 and the nuclear pore-associated protein Mlp1 are required
to localize and stabilize the desumoylation enzyme Ulp1 at the
nuclear pore complex. Loss of either affects the level of Ulp1 and
the pattern of SUMO conjugates (25). Several genes unrelated to the
SUMO pathway were also obtained in the screen and will be
described elsewhere.
To confirm that the doxorubicin resistance of these strains was
due to the disruption of the intended genes, not to unrelated
mutations acquired during the screening procedure, strains from
the deletion collection were retested for doxorubicin resistance
using a spot assay. Haploid strains were examined because we
found that lower levels of drugs were required to achieve similar
degrees of toxicity compared with diploid strains. Figure 1A shows
that siz1D, siz2D, mlp1D, uip3D, and nup60D strains exhibited approximately 1.6- to 6.5-fold resistance to doxorubicin (42.5 Amol/L)
compared with the haploid WT strain BY4741 in a measure of spot
growth. Thus, we have identified five genes in the SUMO pathway
that, when deleted, confer resistance to doxorubicin.
We next asked whether defects in the other genes in the yeast
SUMO pathway, such as UBA2, UBC9, MMS21, ULP1, and ULP2, also

affect doxorubicin cytotoxicity. With the exception of ULP2, these
genes are essential for viability and, thus, are not present in the
nonessential gene deletion collection used in our initial screen.
Strains tested were temperature-sensitive mutants in uba2, ubc9,
and ulp1, a point mutant in mms21, ulp2D, and a SMT3-allR strain,
in which all lysines in yeast SUMO were replaced with arginine. The
SMT3-allR strain has a defect in SUMO chain formation (26). These
mutants and their parental strains were tested using the spot assay
at both permissive (25jC) and semipermissive (30jC) temperatures. In addition to allowing growth of temperature-sensitive
mutants, doing the assay at 25jC increased the apparent
doxorubicin sensitivity of the WT strain (Fig. 1B). This experiment
showed that, first, SIZ2 does not play a significant role in
doxorubicin sensitivity because deletion of this gene conferred
only weak resistance (especially at 25jC) and because no
significant increase in resistance was observed when SIZ2 was
deleted in combination with SIZ1. Second, mutation of MMS21,
which encodes the third SUMO E3 ligase, did not confer resistance
to doxorubicin. Instead, it resulted in hypersensitivity to doxorubicin treatment. Finally, mutations in all other genes in the SUMO
pathway, including the activating enzyme (uba2ts), conjugating
enzyme (ubc9ts), and desumoylation enzymes (ulp2D and ulp1ts),
caused doxorubicin resistance at 25jC. It has been shown that
uba2ts and ubc9ts mutants have reduced SUMO conjugates even at
25jC (20, 27). We were somewhat surprised that mutants with both
decreased and increased global sumoylation all exhibited the
doxorubicin resistance phenotype. However, ulp2D and ulp1ts
mutants have complex effects on sumoylation because of their
roles both in generating free SUMO and in cleaving SUMO
conjugates. Consequently, in each of these mutants, sumoylation
of some proteins is increased whereas that of others is decreased.
To test whether oversumoylation can result in doxorubicin
resistance, yeast SUMO was overexpressed under the control of a
GAL10 promoter. This technique increases levels of many SUMO
conjugates.4 We found that increased levels of SUMO in WT cells
also resulted in doxorubicin resistance (Fig. 1C). Finally, a defect
in the SUMO chain formation (Smt3-allR) conferred only weak
resistance (Fig. 1B), consistent with a previous finding that chain
formation does not play an essential role in growth or stress
responses in yeast (26). Thus, our results showed that many
different perturbations of the SUMO pathway result in doxorubicin
resistance. Because deletion of the SIZ1 gene exhibited the most
significant resistance to doxorubicin, we focused on identifying
the possible mechanisms by which Siz1 mediates doxorubicin
cytotoxicity.
Effect of siz1 on doxorubicin-induced sumoylation. Because
the three SUMO E3 ligases have dramatically different effects on
doxorubicin cytotoxicity, we wanted to examine cellular sumoylation patterns in the E3 ligase mutant strains. Whole-cell lysates
from log-phase WT, siz1D, siz2D, and mms21 mutant cells were
analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. The majority of the
SUMO conjugates seen in WT cells were not present in the siz1D
cells (Fig. 2), in agreement with published data (28). In contrast,
SUMO conjugates in the siz2D and mms21 mutant strains were
very similar to those in the WT strain. It has been shown that
oxidative and ethanol stresses (29) and MMS (30) induce
sumoylation of certain proteins in yeast. We next examined
whether doxorubicin induces sumoylation and whether deletion of

respectively. C, overexpression of Smt3 confers resistance to doxorubicin.

Cancer Research

The HA-tagged Top2 strain and the mutant top2-SNM-HA (21)
that carries mutations at the sumoylation sites were first analyzed
for sensitivity to doxorubicin. As a reference, we used the top2-4ts
allele, which has defects in chromosomal segregation at the
nonpermissive temperature (35jC; ref. 36) and is resistant to
doxorubicin (37). Figure 3A shows that the top2-4ts strain was
indeed resistant to doxorubicin at the semipermissive temperature
(30jC), whereas mutation of the SUMO attachment sites in Top2
did not affect doxorubicin cytotoxicity in either the WT or siz1D
background. Thus, reduced sumoylation of Top2 is not responsible
for the doxorubicin resistance phenotype in siz1D mutant.
Septin cytoskeletal proteins form filaments at the yeast bud
neck, and the septins Cdc3, Cdc11, and Shs1/Sep7 are the most
abundant SUMO conjugates in G2-M-arrested yeast cells (31). SIZ1
is absolutely required for SUMO attachment to septins in vivo (28).
To test whether sumoylation of septins has any effect on
doxorubicin resistance, doxorubicin sensitivity was tested in a
mutant (cdc3-D94-HA) carrying a deletion of the 94 NH2-terminal
residues of Cdc3, which harbors its four major SUMO attachment
sites, and in a mutant carrying mutations at the major SUMO
attachment sites of all three sumoylated septins (cdc3-4,11,30,63HA, cdc11-R412-HA, shs1-R426, 437-HA; ref. 31). We found that these
septin mutants were slightly resistant to doxorubicin compared
with WT but were much less resistant than siz1D cells (Fig. 3B). We
inferred from these results that SUMO modification of septins
mediates some aspects of doxorubicin cytotoxicity but that SUMO
attachment to other proteins is also involved.
PCNA (Pol30) is an essential processivity factor for DNA
replication and repair (30). PCNA is both ubiquitylated and
sumoylated on treatment of cells with the DNA-damaging agent
MMS. PCNA has two SUMO conjugation sites: K127 and K164 (30),
where K164 is also the site of RAD6-mediated ubiquitylation.
Ubiquitylation at this site is required for bypass of replicationblocking lesions (30, 38, 39), whereas sumoylation acts separately
from ubiquitylation and inhibits recruitment of the Rad52 pathway
recombination machinery. We found that mutations at K127
(pol30/K127R), K164 (pol30/K164R), or both sites (pol30/K127R/
K164R) of PCNA confer hypersensitivity to doxorubicin (Fig. 3B).
Deletion of the SIZ1 gene in these PCNA mutant strains resulted in
a resistance phenotype similar to that of siz1D cells (Fig. 3B).
Together, these results show that neither sumoylation of PCNA at
either site nor ubiquitylation at K164, which is also eliminated by
the lysine to arginine mutation, is involved in the resistance of
siz1D cells to doxorubicin.
During the course of these experiments, we also tested the effect
of siz1D on doxorubicin sensitivity of rad6D and rad52D mutants
because sumoylation and ubiquitylation of PCNA have effects on
both the RAD6- and RAD52-dependent DNA repair pathways. Both
rad6D and rad52D mutants are hypersensitive to doxorubicin, but
remarkably, deleting SIZ1 completely suppressed the hypersensitivity of both of these mutants (Fig. 3C). In fact, the siz1Drad6D
and siz1Drad52D mutants were nearly as resistant to doxorubicin
as the siz1D strain. These results indicate that doxorubicindependent DNA damage is dramatically reduced in these mutants
and suggest that the siz1D mutation is affecting a step upstream
from DNA damage, possibly by reducing the ability of doxorubicin
to affect its intracellular target(s).
Doxorubicin-induced cell cycle arrest is slightly compromised in the siz1 deletion strain. In mammalian cells,
doxorubicin induces cell cycle arrest in the G2-M phase (40). We
wanted to test whether doxorubicin causes a G2-M arrest in WT

Figure 2. SUMO conjugates induced by doxorubicin in yeast cells. Equal
amounts of log-phase WT (JD52), siz1DL, siz2DT , and mms21 mutants were
treated with or without doxorubicin (65 Amol/L) for 5 h. Following cell lysis with
NaOH/trichloroacetic acid, SUMO conjugates were resolved through a 4% to
20% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, blotted onto a membrane, and probed with a
polyclonal anti-Smt3 antibody. Molecular weight markers are indicated.

SIZ1 affects this process. A significant increase in sumoylation was
observed in WT cells when treated with doxorubicin (68 Amol/L,
5 h). Most of the doxorubicin-induced conjugates were missing in
the siz1D cells, but the patterns of doxorubicin-induced SUMO
conjugates in the siz2D and mms21 cells were almost identical to
that of the WT cells. Given their size, abundance, and SIZ1
dependence, it is likely that the most abundant doxorubicininduced conjugates are septin cytoskeletal proteins (31). It remains
to be determined whether these conjugates are specifically induced
by doxorubicin or whether their induction is an indirect effect
resulting from doxorubicin-dependent cell cycle arrest.
Sumoylation of septins, but not of proliferating cell nuclear
antigen or Top2, is involved in SIZ1-mediated doxorubicin
cytotoxicity. Siz1 is the SUMO E3 ligase responsible for producing
many of the most abundant SUMO conjugates in log-phase yeast
cells (Fig. 2; ref. 23). Although >300 sumoylated proteins have been
identified thus far (32–34), the only known substrates that are
modified exclusively by Siz1 are the septin cytoskeletal proteins
(31) and proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA)/Pol30 at its
Lys164 site (30). We therefore tested whether sumoylation of these
proteins is involved in Siz1-mediated doxorubicin sensitivity. We
also tested the effect of SUMO attachment to Top2, which can be
sumoylated by either Siz1 or Siz2 (35) because of its known
association with doxorubicin cytotoxicity. We reasoned that if Siz1mediated doxorubicin sensitivity requires appropriate levels of
sumoylated septins, PCNA, or Top2, then strains carrying
mutations at the SUMO attachment sites of these proteins should
show resistance to doxorubicin. Yeast strains carrying hemagglutinin epitope (HA)-tagged versions of these proteins with or
without mutations at the SUMO attachment sites were studied.
Western blot analysis of the whole-cell extracts before and after
immunoprecipitation using an anti-HA and anti-SMT3 antibodies
was done to ensure that the mutant SUMO attachment sites were
indeed devoid of sumoylation in the presence of doxorubicin
(Supplementary Fig. S1).

SUMO Pathway and Doxorubicin Cytotoxicity

yeast and, if so, whether siz1D cells respond differently. WT
and siz1D cells were grown to log phase and treated with doxorubicin for 12 h. FACS analysis showed that WT and siz1D cells had
similar cell cycle profiles in the absence of doxorubicin (Fig. 4A;
Supplementary Table S2). In the presence of doxorubicin, a portion
of the WT cells accumulated in the S and G2-M phases. Although
some siz1D cells also accumulated at S and G2-M phases in
response to doxorubicin treatment, the fraction of siz1D cells
arrested in S phase were significantly lower than that of WT cells
(Fig. 4A; Supplementary Table S2). Thus, the doxorubicin resistance
of siz1D cells is associated with reduced cell cycle arrest.
Deletion of the SIZ1 gene impairs doxorubicin retention.
The results that siz1D strongly suppresses the doxorubicin
hypersensitivity of DNA repair mutants and reduces doxorubicininduced cell cycle arrest, combined with the observation that
sumoylation of the plasma membrane–associated septin proteins
plays a role in doxorubicin cytotoxicity, led us to test whether siz1D
cells exhibit a defect in doxorubicin uptake or retention. The
cellular content of doxorubicin, which is fluorescent, was measured
in WT and siz1D cells by flow cytometry. As shown in Fig. 4B, there
was little difference in the MFI between the WT and siz1D mutant
cells treated with doxorubicin for 1 h, suggesting that siz1D cells
had no defects in drug intake. In addition, the rate of doxorubicin
efflux was similar in WT and siz1D cells because the MFIs
measured at 1 h (Fig. 4B; data not shown) were similar in both
strains. However, when the cells were treated for 4 or 6 h, the MFI
in the siz1D mutant was significantly lower than that in WT cells.
The MFI measurement was confirmed by the D values as calculated
by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistic (see Materials and Methods).
The D values were 0.2 at 4 h and 0.3 at 6 h (Fig. 4B), which are
considered as significant. The difference in MFI between the siz1D
and WT cells at these time points was not due to cell death in WT
cells because the amount of cells stained with propidium iodide,
which is indicative of leaky membrane, was similarly low (f13%)
in both strains. These data, in conjunction with the fact that
treatment with doxorubicin for 1 h did not increase significant
amount of SUMO conjugates (Supplementary Fig. S3), suggest that
doxorubicin resistance of siz1D cells is, at least in part, due to the
impairment of drug accumulation.
To investigate whether doxorubicin resistance in the siz1D
mutant is related to increased activity of PDR/MDR ATP-binding
cassette (ABC) drug transporters, we asked whether mutations in
yeast PDR/MDR genes affect this phenotype. The yeast ABC
transporters with the best-characterized roles in drug resistance
are Pdr5 and Snq2, although yeast contains 14 other full-length
ABC cassette proteins with roles in drug resistance and other
processes. Recent mass spectrometry data identified Pdr5 as a
SUMO substrate (34). Furthermore, a yeast mutant lacking PDR5 is
sensitive to doxorubicin (Fig. 4C; ref. 41), showing that Pdr5 does
mediate doxorubicin efflux. In contrast, the snq2D mutant was not
hypersensitive to doxorubicin (Fig. 4C, top), indicating a different
substrate specificity. To test whether Pdr5 is responsible for
doxorubicin resistance in siz1D cells, we deleted the PDR5 gene in
the siz1D strain. Figure 4C (bottom) shows that deletion of the
PDR5 gene partially enhanced doxorubicin cytotoxicity in siz1D
cells, although the siz1Dpdr5D strain was still more resistant than
the WT strain. This experiment does not conclusively address
whether higher Pdr5 activity partially contributes to the doxorubicin resistance of siz1D cells because pdr5D increased the
sensitivity of both WT and siz1D cells. To further address this
issue, we next tested sensitivity of siz1D mutants to the known

doxorubicin, they were approximately equally sensitive to VP16
and CPT-11 and were, if anything, slightly hypersensitive to camptothecin (3-fold). Thus, these data suggest that reduced global
sumoylation may play different roles in mediating the cytotoxicity
of different anticancer agents.

Pdr5 substrate cycloheximide. Increased Pdr5 activity results in
cycloheximide resistance (42), so if the doxorubicin resistance of
the siz1D strain is partially mediated by elevated Pdr5 activity, this
strain should also show cycloheximide resistance. However, the
siz1D strain was not resistant to cycloheximide (Fig. 4D). Together,
the results that siz1D is sensitive to cycloheximide and that the
siz1Dpdr5D strain still shows significant doxorubicin resistance
clearly show that factors other than Pdr5 are involved in the
doxorubicin resistance of the siz1D mutant.
Sensitivity of the siz1D mutant to other cytotoxic agents.
One characteristic of PDR/MDR phenotypes is cross-resistance to
different classes of cytotoxic agents. We next examined whether
siz1D cells have this phenotype by treating WT and siz1D cells with
several clinically used anticancer agents: the Top2 inhibitors
daunorubicin and etoposide (VP16), the Top1 inhibitors camptothecin and irinotecan (CPT-11), cisplatin, and 5-FU. The results are
summarized in Table 1. Although siz1D cells were cross-resistant to
daunorubicin, they were hypersensitive to cisplatin. In addition, the
siz1D mutant and the WT cells were equally sensitive to 5-FU.
Because the yeast strains used were relatively insensitive to VP16,
camptothecin, and CPT-11 even at an extremely high concentration
(e.g., 1 mmol/L camptothecin), we introduced into the WT and
siz1D mutant cells a targeted disruption of the ERG6 (ISE1) gene to
ablate ergosterol biosynthesis, which has been shown to enhance
permeability to some anticancer drugs (43). erg6D cells exhibited
slow growth but showed significantly enhanced sensitivity to these
drugs (Table 1; Supplementary Fig. S2). Curiously, the siz1D
mutation seemed to partially suppress the slow growth phenotype
of the erg6D mutant. These experiments showed that, although
siz1Derg6D cells were 20-fold more resistant than erg6D cells to

Discussion
The present study provides the first demonstration that defects
in many steps of the SUMO pathway result in resistance to
doxorubicin treatment. Alterations in the SUMO conjugation
machinery have been shown to cause hypersensitivity to a variety
of DNA-damaging agents, such as Top1 poisons, UV light, HU, or
MMS (21, 44–46), but this is the first example of drug resistance in
SUMO pathway mutants. Interestingly, defects in either sumoylation (siz1D, siz2D, uba2ts, and ubs9ts) or desumoylation (ulp1ts,
ulp2D, nup60D, mlp1D, and uip3D) cause resistance to doxorubicin
as does overexpression of SUMO. Similar apparently contradictory
results have been reported previously. For example, overexpression
of both SUMO (SMT3) and ULP2 (SMT4) suppresses the growth
defects of a mif2 mutant (which encodes a centromere protein;
ref. 47). This is probably partly related to the fact that ulp2D and
ulp1ts mutants each strongly increase sumoylation of some
proteins while decreasing sumoylation of others (26, 46, 48). Thus,
it seems most likely that there is a protein or proteins that must
undergo Siz1-dependent sumoylation for cells to exhibit WT
doxorubicin sensitivity and that sumoylation of this protein is also
reduced in the ulp2D and ulp1ts mutants. An alternative possibility
is that both undersumoylation and oversumoylation of the same
or different protein(s) result in the same phenotype, possibly by

NOTE: Sensitivity to doxorubicin, daunorubicin, cisplatin, and 5-FU was assessed in isogenic BY4741 (WT) and siz1D cells using a semiquantitative spot
assay. Sensitivity to VP16, camptothecin, and CPT-11 was assessed in erg6D cells with or without deletion of the Siz1. Fold represents fold resistance (+)
or sensitivity ( ) relative to the corresponding WT cells and was calculated using the percentage growth from duplicate spots at the concentration at
which 10% to 20% (doxorubicin, daunorubicin, cisplatin, 5-FU, and camptothecin) or 70% to 80% (VP16 and CPT-11) of the WT (SIZ1+) cells survived. A
relative sensitivity of ‘‘1’’ represents similar sensitivity in the WT and siz1D strains. The values were derived from averages of at least three independent
experiments. Concentrations of the drugs were as follows: doxorubicin, 42.5 Amol/L; daunorubicin, 44 Amol/L; cisplatin, 100 Amol/L; 5-FU, 190 Amol/L;
camptothecin, 0.5 mmol/L; VP16 (etoposide), 0.25 mmol/L; and CPT-11 (irinotecan), 75 Amol/L.

are several possibilities. One is that siz1D increases the level or
activity of ABC transporters. We tested the two major yeast
transporters involved in drug efflux, Pdr5 and Snq2, and found that
they are not major contributors to doxorubicin resistance in siz1D
cells. A snq2D mutant was not hypersensitive to doxorubicin,
suggesting that it does not mediate doxorubicin efflux. The pdr5D
mutant was hypersensitive to doxorubicin, and the pdr5Dsiz1D
double mutant was more drug sensitive than the siz1 single
mutant, but two lines of evidence argue against Pdr5 being a major
factor in doxorubicin resistance in siz1D cells. First, siz1D cells
remained more resistant than the WT strain to doxorubicin after
deleting PDR5 (Fig. 4C), showing that other factors are at least
partially responsible for the resistance. Second, siz1D cells were
distinctively cross-resistant only to daunorubicin but not to other
classes of anticancer agents (Table 1; Supplementary Fig. S2) or to
the known Pdr5 substrate cycloheximide (Fig. 4D). Increased
activity of Pdr5 should result in cycloheximide resistance. These
data correlate with the presence of immediate drug efflux activity
(Fig. 4B), possibly mediated by the major drug efflux pump Pdr5, in
siz1D cells. Yeast also contains 14 other full-length ABC transporters, some of which could mediate the SUMO pathway effect on
doxorubicin cytotoxicity. Some of these genes are coregulated
transcriptionally (53), making the transcriptional regulation
another potential target for the SUMO pathway. Further studies
are needed to determine which of these mechanisms are in effect
and to identify other proteins whose sumoylation status affects
doxorubicin cytotoxicity.

disrupting a cycle of sumoylation and desumoylation that is
necessary for a doxorubicin-related process to occur (13, 49). These
are questions that will be addressed once the relevant SUMO
substrate(s) has been identified.
SUMO modifies hundreds of yeast proteins that participate in
diverse cellular processes (13), so it is not immediately apparent
which substrate is involved in doxorubicin resistance. Many
SUMO conjugates are absent in the siz1D mutants, and it is not
known how many of these mediate cytotoxic activities of
anticancer drugs. Our studies clearly show that septins are
among the Siz1 substrates that mediate the cytotoxic effect of
doxorubicin, but the mechanism is not clear. In yeast, septins
form a ring at the bud neck that is required for normal bud
growth and cytokinesis serves as a scaffold for binding of many
other proteins and forms a barrier in the plasma membrane
between the mother cell and the bud (50). In addition, septins are
involved in the control of secretion, particularly vesicle fusions
and exocytosis (51). It is tantalizing to speculate that sumoylation
of septins may be involved in doxorubicin retention or
intracellular trafficking. The septin mutants examined here,
however, did not have defects in the uptake of doxorubicin (data
not shown). Furthermore, the mutant lacking septin sumoylation
is only weakly doxorubicin resistant, showing that other SUMO
substrates are also involved.
Our data also suggest that reduced sumoylation of Top2 and
PCNA does not contribute to resistance to doxorubicin. It has been
shown that the formation of human SUMO-1-Top2 conjugates
occurs in leukemia CEM cells but not in CEM/VM-1 cells, which
are resistant to the Top2 poison VM-26 (52). However, it is unclear
whether this is due to a defect in the sumoylation pathway in VM26-resistant cells, a decrease in the amount of Top2 to be
sumoylated, or whether drugs simply are not retained in these
resistant cells.
Finally, our data suggest that reduced doxorubicin retention, but
not uptake nor immediate drug efflux, is at least partially
responsible for its doxorubicin resistance in the siz1D mutant,
but the mechanism for this defect remains to be determined. There
