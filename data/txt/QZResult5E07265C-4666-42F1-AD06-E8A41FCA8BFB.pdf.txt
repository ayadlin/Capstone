Abstract
Increased nuclear accumulation of b-catenin, a mediator of canonical Wnt signaling, is found in numerous
tumors and is frequently associated with tumor progression and metastasis. Inhibition of Wnt/b-catenin
signaling therefore is an attractive strategy for anticancer drugs. In this study, we have identiﬁed a novel small
molecule inhibitor of the b-catenin signaling pathway, JW55, that functions via inhibition of the PARP domain
of tankyrase 1 and tankyrase 2 (TNKS1/2), regulators of the b-catenin destruction complex. Inhibition of
TNKS1/2 poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation activity by JW55 led to stabilization of AXIN2, a member of the b-catenin
destruction complex, followed by increased degradation of b-catenin. In a dose-dependent manner, JW55
inhibited canonical Wnt signaling in colon carcinoma cells that contained mutations in either the APC
(adenomatous polyposis coli) locus or in an allele of b-catenin. In addition, JW55 reduced XWnt8-induced
axis duplication in Xenopus embryos and tamoxifen-induced polyposis formation in conditional APC mutant
mice. Together, our ﬁndings provide a novel chemotype for targeting canonical Wnt/b-catenin signaling
through inhibiting the PARP domain of TNKS1/2. Cancer Res; 72(11); 2822–32. 2012 AACR.

Introduction
The Wnt/b-catenin signaling pathway is a key regulator in
numerous cellular processes including stem cell maintenance,
fate decision, and cell-cycle control (1, 2). The main denominator of canonical Wnt signaling, b-catenin, has several
cellular functions. At the cell membrane, it is associated with
E-cadherin and participates in the formation of the adherens
junctions (3). In the cytoplasm, b-catenin can form complexes
with a multitude of proteins, including the b-catenin destrucAuthors' Afﬁliations: 1Oslo University Hospital, SFI-CAST Biomedical

tion complex consisting of adenomatous polyposis coli (APC),
AXIN2, GSK3b, and CK1a (4, 5). Tankyrase 1 and 2 (TNKS1/2)
regulate the stability of the b-catenin destruction complex
through AXIN2 by poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation (6). Although
TNKS1/2 modulates the destruction complex, this complex
interferes with TNKS. Evidence suggests that TNKS is phosphorylated in a cell-cycle–dependent manner by GSK3b (7).
TNKS is furthermore controlled by the ubiquitin E3 ligase
RNF146 that destabilizes TNKS1/2, AXIN2, and itself by ubiquitinylation (8, 9). In the standard model, the destruction
complex regulates the sequential phosphorylation of b-catenin
by the kinases CK1a at S45 and by GSK3b at S33, S37, and T41.
This leads to polyubiquitination by b-TrCP and subsequent
degradation of b-catenin by the proteasome (10, 11). Active
Wnt signaling inhibits the function of the destruction complex,
and b-catenin is not phosphorylated at the N-terminus and
degraded, but enters the nucleus. Nuclear uptake of b-catenin
may be further enhanced by the context-dependent C-terminal
phosphorylation of b-catenin at S675, leading to increased
nuclear translocation (12). In addition to canonical Wnt signaling, a variety of alternative cellular mechanisms may trigger
altered nuclear accumulation of b-catenin. These mechanisms
include the Hif-1a signaling pathway, downregulation of Ecadherin or C-terminal phosphorylation of b-catenin through
HGF-activated cMet (13–15). Furthermore, PKA-involving
mechanisms can lead to C-terminal phosphorylation of b-catenin and enhance its nuclear presence (12). Recently it was
discovered that the primary cilium diverts Jouberin from the
nucleus and limits b-catenin nuclear entry (16).

JW55 Inhibits Wnt Signaling and Colorectal Cancer Cell Growth

In the nucleus, b-catenin exerts a number of functions, such
as binding to the transcription factor TCF/LEF by replacing
Groucho and activation of downstream transcription of genes,
including c-Myc, Cyclin D1, and AXIN2 (2). Nuclear b-catenin
levels are not only determined by the rate of b-catenin import
to the nucleus but also by "nuclear trapping" of b-catenin
through factors such as TCF/LEF (17).
In general, mutations in genes encoding central components
of the Wnt/b-catenin pathway and the destruction complex
lead to the accumulation of nuclear b-catenin and contribute
to tumor initiation and progression (18, 19). Wnt activating
mutations are found in a broad range of solid tumors including
colon cancer, gastric cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma, breast
cancer, medulloblastoma, melanoma, non–small cell lung cancer, pancreas adenocarcinoma, and prostate cancer (20). It has
been well established that the majority of intestinal neoplasia
with deregulated Wnt signaling harbor truncating mutations in
both alleles of the APC tumor suppressor gene (21).
Considerable efforts have been made to identify drugs that
inhibit Wnt/b-catenin signaling (18, 22–25). Published inhibitory
drugs that interact with biotargets directly associated with canonical Wnt signaling include WAY-316606 for SFRP (26), niclosamide for frizzled (27), NCS668036 for Dsh (28), pyrvinium for
CK1 (24), XAV939 and IWR-1 for TNKS1/2 (4, 22), 2,4-diaminoquinazoline, quercetin, PKF115-584 and ICG-001 for b-catenin
and its binding to TCF or CREB (29–32).
TNKS1/2, in particular, is a promising biotarget for pharmaceutical reagents (4, 6). TNKS1/2 is not only involved in
controlling canonical Wnt signaling but has been associated
with further cellular processes through either protein poly
(ADP-ribosyl)ation (PARsylation) or by protein complex formation. These are (i) telomere maintenance by interacting
with TRF1 (33), (ii) spindle formation and stabilization by
binding to NuMA (33), and (iii) glucose metabolism by regulating GLUT4 transport through IRAP (33).
In this work, we have identiﬁed a novel TNKS inhibitor, JW55,
which inhibits the PARP domain of TNKS1/2, leading to the
stabilization of AXIN2 followed by increased degradation of
b-catenin. JW55 efﬁciently decreases canonical Wnt signaling
in colon carcinoma cell lines, in a Xenopus axis duplication assay,
and in tamoxifen-induced tumors in ApcCKO/CKOLgr5-CreERT2þ
mice. The identiﬁed chemotype JW55 may serve as an attractive
start point for the development of novel cancer therapeutics.

(minimum 3 replicates). The cells were grown until colonies
appeared in the control plates and medium was changed twice
a week. The plates were stained and ﬁxed with 0.2% methylene
blue in methanol and washed with PBS. The colonies were
counted manually with a colony counter (Scienceware). Representative pictures of colonies were captured with a Leica MZ

Tumor initiation and treatment in ApcCKO/CKO/Lgr5CreERT2 mice
Seven 12-week old female ApcCKO/CKO/Lgr5-CreERT2 mice
were injected intraperitonally with 25 mg/kg of tamoxifen
(Sigma) diluted in an ethanol and corn oil (ratio 1:4). The mice
were randomized into 2 groups and treated with either JW55
(100 mg/kg) or vehicle (DMSO). Daily per oral applications
started the day after and continued for 3 weeks. The mouse
body weight was measured twice a week. The mice were
sacriﬁced and the intestines were dissected, washed in PBS,
and ﬁxed in formaldehyde [10% solution (v/v) in PBS]. The
small intestines were stained using 1% methylene blue prepared in 10% paraformalaldehyde (PFA)/PBS solution. Small
ileum Swiss-rolls were embedded in parafﬁn sectioned and
stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E). Fixed colons were
embedded in parafﬁn, sectioned and stained with an anti–
b-catenin antibody (610153; BD Transduction Laboratories;
see Supplementary Materials and Methods for further details).
The number and size of the intestinal lesions were quantiﬁed
by the Ellipse program (ViDiTo).

descriptions (34) and Supplementary Materials and Methods.

Results
JW55 is a potent and selective inhibitor of the canonical
Wnt pathway
To identify chemical compounds that inhibit the canonical
Wnt signaling pathway, a library consisting of 37,000 small
molecules (ChemBioNet) was screened using HEK293 cells
that were stably transfected with a SuperTOP-d1EGFP reporter
(34). The vector contains a synthetic TCF-responsive promoter
(SuperTOP: 7 x TCF binding sites) that initiates the expression
of destabilized d1EGFP upon activation of canonical Wnt
signaling (34). Canonical Wnt signaling was activated using
conditioned media (CM) from L Wnt3a expressing cells. The
screen resulted in 77 primary hits including the previously
described compounds JW67 and JW74 (34) and JW55 (Fig. 1A,
right panel). To evaluate the efﬁcacy and speciﬁcity of JW55,
the compound was tested in 3 different luciferase reporter
assays. Wnt3a-induced HEK293 cells containing a transiently
transfected ST-Luc (SuperTop-luciferase) reporter showed
inhibition by JW55 with an IC50 value of 470 nmol/L (Fig.
1A, left panel and Supplementary Fig. S1A). In contrast, Shh
Light II cells (Gli1-Luc reporter) that were activated with 50%
Shh-CM were not inhibited by 10 or 1 mmol/L JW55. Also,
TNFaactivated HEK293 cells containing a transiently

JW55 Inhibits Wnt Signaling and Colorectal Cancer Cell Growth

transfected NF-kB–Luciferase (NF-kB-Luc) plasmid showed
no pathway inhibition in the presence of 10 or 1 mmol/L of
JW55 (Fig. 1B and C).
The selectivity and speciﬁcity of JW55 was further tested in
an in vivo Xenopus axis duplication assay, a highly stringent test
for examining inhibitors of canonical Wnt signaling. When
injected into the ventral blastomeres of 4-cell stage Xenopus
laevis embryos, XWnt8 mRNA induced Wnt signaling resulting
in the formation of a second body axis. By using selective Wnt
inhibitors, the axis duplication can be inhibited and a normal
phenotype restored (34). Coinjection of 10 pg XWnt8 and 2
pmol of JW55 resulted in a signiﬁcant 51% reduction of the axis
duplication incidence in developing frog embryos when compared with the DMSO vehicle control (z-test, P ¼ 0.001; Fig. 1D,
left). This result provided evidence that JW55 acts as a speciﬁc
and effective inhibitor of canonical Wnt signaling.
JW55 regulates b-catenin stability at the level of the
destruction complex
To identify the interference point of JW55 with canonical
Wnt signaling, the effect of JW55 was monitored after LiClinduced activation of the pathway. The activity of GSK3b,
which is part of the b-catenin destruction complex, is reduced
in the presence of LiCl (35), rendering the N-terminal phosphorylation of b-catenin by GSK3b ineffective. This causes
nuclear accumulation of b-catenin and active Wnt signaling.
HEK293 cells, transiently transfected with ST-Luc and Renilla,
were incubated with 25 mmol/L LiCl and different doses of
JW55. The LiCl-activating effect was counteracted by JW55 in a
dose-dependent manner with an IC50 value of 360 nmol/L,
indicating that JW55 acts at the level or downstream of the
destruction complex (Fig. 2A, left and Supplementary Fig. S1B).
Next, the effect of JW55 on regulating the activity of b-catenin was tested. We used (i) wild-type b-catenin and (ii)
b-catenin with point mutations in the N-terminal phosphorylation sites (S33, S37, T41, and S45) that resists degradation
and functions as dominant active (da-Cat). Plasmids containing full-length b-catenin or da-Cat, along with ST-Luc and
Renilla, were transiently transfected in HEK293 cells. The
expression of wild-type b-catenin led to an increased ST-Luc
reporter activity that could be reduced by 55% when the
transfected cells were exposed to 10 mmol/L of JW55 (normality
test failed, rank sum test: P ¼ 0.001; Fig. 2A, right). In contrast,
the activation of the pathway by da-Cat could not be inhibited
by 10 mmol/L JW55, further indicating that JW55 acts at the
level or downstream of the destruction complex (normality test
failed, rank sum test: P ¼ 0.457; Fig. 2A, right).
JW55 inhibits canonical Wnt signaling in colorectal
cancer cell lines in vitro
Mutations in the APC gene, which occur in nearly all
colorectal cancers (CRC; ref. 18), lead to ineffective degradation
of b-catenin and aberrant upregulation of Wnt signaling. The
cell lines SW480 and HCT-15 (mutated in codon 1338 and 1417
of the APC gene, respectively) were stably transfected with STLuc and Renilla and incubated at various doses of JW55 for 48
hours. A dose-dependent reduction of luciferase activity was
detected in both cell lines. JW55 was effective in the range of 1

to 5 mmol/L in SW480 cells and 0.01 to 5 mmol/L in HCT-15 cells
(Fig. 2B, left). Next, HCT116 CRC cells with integrated ST-Luc
and Renilla reporters were used to test JW55. HCT116 carries a
point mutation in the CK1a-dependent phosphorylation site
S45 of one b-catenin allele; however, S45-mutated b-catenin
may still be phosphorylated in the remaining GSK3b phosphorylation sites (e.g. S33, S37, and T41), with resulting semiregulated b-catenin turnover (36). In HCT116 cells, JW55 was
effective in the range of 0.01 to 5 mmol/L (Fig. 2B, right). A basal
luciferase expression level at approximately 50% was reached
after exposure to 5 mmol/L in the CRC cells.
Furthermore, the effect of JW55 on the expression of
endogenous Wnt target genes was examined by real-time
PCR in the cell lines SW480 and DLD-1. Compared with
SW480 cells, the APC mutation in DLD-1 cells results in a
more extensive C-terminal deletion (37). In SW480 cells, a
dose-dependent decline in the expression of the 3 target
genes was observed: AXIN2 (25 mmol/L: 55% and 10 mmol/L:
45%), SP5 (25 mmol/L: 38% and 10 mmol/L: 15%) and NKD1
(25 mmol/L: 31% and 10 mmol/L: 7%; Fig. 2C, left). A similar
reduction was observed in DLD-1 cells after exposure to
10 mmol/L of JW55 (AXIN2: 72%, SP5: 38% and NKD1:
66%; Fig. 2C, right). Subsequently, a more extensive Illumina
gene expression analysis was carried out in JW55-treated
SW480 cells. Several Wnt target genes (Wnt homepage) were
differently expressed (Supplementary Table S1). Upregulated
genes included (Log2  0.5): WISP3, TCF7, PLAUR, EFNB2,
and NOTUM. Downregulated genes included (Log2  0.5):
AXIN2, NKD1, DKK1, MMP7, ID2, GAST, FZD2, EDN1, CYR61,
SOX18 and, similar to our previous observations (34), members of the SPANX gene family.

experiments along with error bars depicting SDs. Right, the images from a representative assay show that the general SW480 colony sizes are smaller in
increased doses of JW55.

JW55 destabilizes b-catenin by increasing cytoplasmic
AXIN2 levels
Previous studies have shown that an increase in AXIN2 steadystate levels induced by TNKS1/2 or CK1a inhibitors is accompanied by a decrease in b-catenin concentrations (4, 22, 24, 34).
Increased levels of AXIN2 protein promote degradation of
b-catenin even in cells with truncated APC (4, 22, 38). Western
blot analysis of SW480 cells lysates revealed a dose-dependent
increase of cytoplasmic AXIN2 after JW55 treatment (range:
10 mmol/L–100 nmol/L; Fig. 3A and Supplementary Fig. S2).
Furthermore, an antibody against the active and nonphosphorylated form of b-catenin (active b-catenin, ABC) identiﬁed
reduced levels of b-catenin in the cytoplasm of JW55-treated
cells (Fig. 3A and Supplementary Fig. S2). In addition, a modest
reduction of total b-catenin and a substantial decrease of nuclear
ABC were observed, and an increase in phosphorylated b-catenin
(pb-catenin) levels was seen indicating ongoing b-catenin degradation (Fig. 3A and Supplementary Fig. S2).
To gain further insight into the changes in cellular distribution of AXIN2 and b-catenin, JW55-treated SW480 cells were

www.aacrjournals.org

analyzed by immunoﬂuorescence. A general reduction of total
b-catenin, both in the cytoplasmic and nuclear compartments,
was detected at the doses of 5 and 1 mmol/L (equal shutter
speed; Supplementary Fig. S3). Confocal microscopy (equal
shutter speeds) revealed, in accordance with the Western blot
analysis, that the levels of cytoplasmic AXIN2 were signiﬁcantly
increased (Fig. 3B) and large protein foci, probably representing accumulated destruction complexes, were observed (Fig.
3B, arrows). Clusters of colocalized cytoplasmic b-catenin and
AXIN2 have previously been detected in SW480 cells after
treatment with the Wnt antagonist JW74 (34). Similar to JW74,
enhanced phosphorylation and resulting degradation of
b-catenin after JW55 exposure seemed to be orchestrated by
stabilization of AXIN2 in the destruction complex (Fig. 3 and 5).
JW55 speciﬁcally inhibits the PARsylation activity of
TNKS1 and TNKS2
By inhibiting the PARP domain of TNKS1/2, XAV939, IWR-1,
and JW74 prevent auto-PARsylation of TNKS1/2 and PARsylation of AXIN2 (4, 22, 39, 40). This leads to a stabilization of

JW55 Inhibits Wnt Signaling and Colorectal Cancer Cell Growth

AXIN2, an accumulation of proteins in the destruction
complex followed ultimately by an increased degradation
of b-catenin (4, 22). To test whether JW55 decreased canonical Wnt signaling by directly inhibiting the PARP domain
of TNKS1/2, we carried out biochemical assays for monitoring the activity of TNKS1/2 and PARP. JW55 decreased
auto-PARsylation of TNKS1/2 in vitro with IC50 values of
1.9 mmol/L and 830 nmol/L, respectively (Fig. 4A and Supplementary Fig. S1C). However, in contrast to XAV939
(ref. 4; Fig. 4A and Supplementary Fig. S1D), but similar to
IWR-1 (4), JW55 exhibited no inhibition of PARP1 at doses
up to 20 mmol/L (Fig. 4A). Although further details may
emerge, present evidence suggests that JW55 decreases
canonical Wnt signaling by speciﬁcally inhibiting the PARP
domain of TNKS1/2 (Fig. 5), although leaving the activity of
the PARP domain of at least PARP1 unaffected. Molecular
docking of JW55 into the adenosine site of the human PARP
domain of TNKS2 using the structure of the PARP domain in
complex with IWR-1 (X-ray, PDB code 3UA9) reveals that the
binding site and position of JW55 in the model is similar to
IWR-1 (40), but different from XAV939 (Supplementary Fig.
S4). Binding of JW55 to recombinant TNKS2 protein was also
observed by using a ﬂuorescence polarization competition
assay, with a structurally similar but inactive analog as a
negative control (ref. 41; Supplementary Fig. S5). Interestingly, opposite to the effect of XAV939 (4), a decrease in
endogenous TNKS1/2 levels was detected after exposure to
JW55 and IWR-1 in SW480 cells.
JW55 reduces growth of SW480 colon cancer cells
CRC cells can enter cell-cycle arrest as a result of antagonized canonical Wnt signaling (42–44). Various proliferation
assays were carried out to see whether JW55-mediated inhibition of canonical Wnt signaling would affect CRC cell growth.
First, SW480 cells were incubated with 10 mmol/L JW55 and
labeled with bromodeoxyuridine (BrdUrd) and propidium
iodide (PI). The subsequent ﬂow cytometry cell-cycle analysis
revealed that JW55 treatment lowered the proportion of cells in
the S phase (from 28.4% in DMSO-treated controls to 22.2%),
raised moderately the cell fraction in the G1 phase (from
37.3%–38.8%) and increased the number of cells in G2–M phase
(from 34.3%–39%; Fig. 6A).

Next, we monitored the cell proliferation kinetics using
IncuCyte. SW480 cells were exposed to 10, 5, or 1 mmol/L of
JW55 for 9 days, and the conﬂuency was measured every 2
hours. All doses of JW55 reduced SW480 cell growth and the
most robust effect was detected at a dose of 10 mmol/L JW55.
The conﬂuency was reduced to 55% relative to the DMSO
control at the end of experiment (Fig. 6B). In parallel, the
CRC cell line RKO, which contains wild-type APC and
b-catenin and exerts Wnt-independent cell growth, was used
as a control. RKO cells reached 100% conﬂuency within 7
days and were not affected by treatment with 10 mmol/L
JW55 (Fig. 6B).
Furthermore, proliferation of SW480 cells was examined by
consecutive passages in the presence of 5, 2.5, or 1 mmol/L
JW55. A dose-dependent decrease of cell numbers over 3
passages was noted in SW480 cells in the presence of JW55,
whereas HeLa cells (Wnt-independent cervical cancer cells)
remained unaffected (Fig. 6C). Finally, SW480 cells were grown
under low serum conditions (1% FBS) along with various
concentrations of JW55 (5, 1, and 0.1 mmol/L) and the formation of colonies was quantiﬁed. We observed a concentrationdependent reduction of colony numbers in SW480 cells and no
reduction in colony numbers in the control cell lines HeLa and
RKO when cultured in 5 mmol/L JW55 (Fig. 6D, left). All SW480
colonies, which formed in the presence of JW55, were substantially smaller (Fig. 6D, right).
Taken together, these data showed that JW55-mediated
inhibition of canonical Wnt signaling resulted in reduced
cell-cycle progression, proliferation, and colony formation in
the CRC cell line SW480 in vitro.
JW55 reduces tumor development in conditional Apc
knockout mice
Recently, the leucine-rich repeat containing G-protein–coupled receptor 5 (Lgr5) was established as a speciﬁc marker for
intestinal epithelium stem cells (ISC). The knockin mouse Lgr5EGFP-IRES-CreERT2, further referred to as Lgr5-CreERT2,
expresses a tamoxifen-regulated variant of Cre recombinase
that is under the control of the Lgr5 locus (45). The
Cre-mediated excision of the ﬂoxed exon 14 in mice with
conditional Apc alleles (CKO) changes the reading frame
downstream of the deletion. This results in the production of

a truncated and nonfunctional 580 amino acid (aa) Apc
polypeptide (46) that relates to the homozygous mutations
seen in the intestinal cancer model mouse ApcMin (multiple
intestinal neoplasia, Min; ref. 47). Lgr5-CreERT2 mice were
intercrossed with ApcCKO/CKO animals and multiple tumors
were observed after tamoxifen injections in the small intestine
(ileum) and the colon of ApcCKO/CKOLgr5-CreERT2þ mice (Fig.
7A and Supplementary Fig S6). In the colon, fewer tumors
developed when compared with the general adenoma progress
in the small intestine. To evaluate the JW55-mediated decrease
of intestinal tumor development in vivo, ApcCKO/CKOLgr5CreERT2þ mice were injected intraperitoneally with a 25
mg/kg single dose of tamoxifen. A day after, daily per oral
applications of JW55 (100 mg/kg; 3 females) or vehicle (DMSO;
4 females) were initiated. The dose of 100 mg/kg was chosen to
counteract the rapid liver metabolism of JW55 as indicated by
the human liver microsome stability analysis (t1/2 ¼ 10.1
minutes; Supplementary Fig. S7A). No measurable effects on
mouse body weight were noticed throughout the experiment
period (Supplementary Fig. S7B). After 21 days, the mice were
sacriﬁced and the dissected intestines were embedded in
parafﬁn and sectioned. Immunohistochemical staining
revealed that the neoplastic lesions expressed b-catenin and
the mouse ISC marker Ephrin type-B receptor 2 (EphB2),
indicating aberrant activation of canonical Wnt signaling in
the tumor tissue (Fig. 7B; refs. 44, 48–50). The b-catenin–
stained colon adenomas contrasted with the surrounding
healthy mucosa, and image analysis software (Ellipse) was
used to quantify the number and areas of b-catenin–positive
lesions in the colon (Supplementary Fig. S7C). As it was
impossible to distinguish the borders of individual tumors in
the small intestine (ileum), only the total tumor area per mouse
was recorded. In the ileum, a signiﬁcant reduction of the total
tumor area was observed after JW55 injections (mean: 2.93
mm2 and median: 2.95 mm2) when compared with the control
group (mean: 8.84 mm2 and median: 9.51 mm2; normality test
failed, rank sum test: P ¼ 0.003; Fig. 7A and C, top panel). In the
colon, the tumor count was substantially reduced in JW55treated mice (mean: 9.7 and median: 6.0) when evaluated
against the control group (mean: 33.8 and median: 26.0; normality test failed, rank sum test: P ¼ 0.057; Fig. 7C, bottom
panel). Furthermore, a signiﬁcant decrease of the total tumor
area was noticed after injections with JW55 (mean: 0.022 mm2)
when compared with the control group (mean: 0.154 mm2;
Students t test: P ¼ 0.009; Fig. 7C, bottom panel). The area of
single tumors was signiﬁcantly reduced after injections with
JW55 (mean: 0.0025 mm2) when compared with the untreated
group (mean: 0.0049 mm2; Students t test: P ¼ 0.043; Fig. 7C,
bottom panel). Interestingly, the proportion of cells that
expressed Ki67, a marker of proliferating and ISC-like cells
(50), was substantially decreased in adenomas exposed to JW55
when compared with tumors that developed in the control
mice (Fig. 7B, panel h and i).
Importantly, when examining the healthy mucosa with
antibodies against various epithelial cell populations, such as
EphB2 for ISCs and Krt20 for terminally differentiated epithelial cells (50), we did not observe changes in its morphology,
proliferation, or differentiation after exposure to JW55 (Fig.

7D). In summary, the results obtained from JW55-treated
conditional Apc knockout mice indicated that in vivo smallmolecular inhibition of TNKS1/2 leads to decreased canonical
Wnt signaling followed by reduced adenoma induction and
possibly progression of adenoma carcinoma.

Discussion
Altered properties of Wnt/b-catenin signaling are enabling
factors for a multitude of diseases, including cancer. Among
known interference points in the canonical Wnt signaling
pathway, the PARP domains of TNKS1/2 seem to be a particular suitable target for inhibiting the pathway. Blocking the
PARP domain of TNKS1/2 with low molecular inhibitors, such
as XAV939, IWR-1, and JW74 (4, 34), leads to the stabilization of
the destruction complex that triggers increased degradation of
b-catenin (19). As predicted for a TNKS inhibitor, we observed
a massive cytoplasmic accumulation of AXIN2 after treatment
with 500 nmol/L JW55, followed by a signiﬁcant reduction of
b-catenin levels in vitro (Fig. 5). A similar stabilization of AXIN2
was also seen with JW74, XAV939, and IWR-1 (4, 22, 34).
However, despite the substantial increased speciﬁcity of
JW55 to the PARP domain of TNKS1/2 when compared with
XAV939, we cannot rule out that JW55 may affect additional
mechanisms that contribute to the observed effects in colon
cancer cell lines and in ApcCKO/CKOLgr5-CreERT2þ mice. For
instance pyrvinium decreases Wnt signaling both by stabilizing
AXIN2 and through inhibition of CK1a (24). Furthermore, in
complementation to altering canonical Wnt/b-catenin signaling, a JW55-mediated inhibition of TNKS1/2 may induce
additional intracellular effects including altered telomere
maintenance or spindle formation.
The in vivo treatment of tamoxifen-induced polyposis in
ApcCKO/CKOLgr5-CreERT2þ mice JW55 showed a profound
effect on tumor progression. In comparison with the wellestablished ApcMin mice (47), this mouse model provides a
clearer assay for scoring adenoma formation because the
tumor induction and treatment are time controlled. However,
as adenoma induction is rather strong, it is difﬁcult to assess
later stages of CRC development as mouse mortality does not
allow long-term tracking of the tumors. Thus, the presented
data further solidify the functional implication of PARsylation
by TNKS1/2 in a malignant transformation of the colon and the
small intestine.
Interestingly, in our setting, the exposure of progenitor cells
in a normal crypt to JW55 did not exert visible alterations in the
intact mucosa as measured with the markers EphB2, Ki67, and
Krt20. However, we cannot exclude that a longer treatment
may cause reduction in cell turnover in the intestine epithelium (45). The efﬁcient in vivo reduction of adenomas in mice
and CRC growth in vitro by a tankyrase-speciﬁc inhibitor
further strengthens the importance of TNKS and b-catenin as
potential therapeutic biotargets.
TNKS1/2 is a member of a family of 5 PARP proteins in
humans, including PARP1, which is an extensively explored
target for drug development (33). Particularly in the BRCA1/
2 mutant background, PARP1 inhibitors exhibit therapeutic
effects in vitro and in vivo. Because PARP proteins are

involved in a range of biologic functions, including genome
maintenance, the selectivity of PARP inhibitors may be an
issue in the therapeutic setting. Similar to XAV939, JW55
inhibits auto-PARsylation of TNKS1 and TNKS2 in a biochemical assay. However, in contrast to XAV939, we see no
evidence for the inhibition of PARP1 by JW55, making this
chemotype attractive for further development toward a
TNKS1/2 selective inhibitor. It remains to be determined
in which settings a preferred PARP1 inhibitor such as for
instance olaparib, a broad PARP inhibitor such as XAV939,
or a selective TNKS inhibitor such as JW55, JW74, and IWR-1
may be the favorable choice.
