ABSTRACT
Purpose: Cdc7 is a serine/threonine kinase which is responsible for the ‘firing’ of
replication origins leading to initiation of DNA replication. Inhibition or depletion of
Cdc7 in normal cells triggers a DNA origin activation checkpoint causing a reversible
G1 arrest. Here we investigate Cdc7 as a novel therapeutic target in pancreatic cancer.
Experimental design: Cdc7 target validation was performed by immunoexpression
profiling in a cohort of 73 patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma including 24
controls. Secondly Cdc7 kinase was targeted in Capan-1 and PANC-1 pancreatic cancer
cell line models using either an siRNA against Cdc7 or alternatively a small molecule
inhibitor (SMI) of Cdc7 (PHA-767491).
Results: Cdc7 was significantly overexpressed in pancreatic adenocarcinoma
compared to benign pancreatic tissue (median LI 34.3% vs. 1.3%; P<0.0001). Cdc7
knockdown using siRNA in Capan-1 and PANC-1 cells resulted in marked apoptotic
cell death when compared with control cells. A prominent sub-G1 peak was seen on
flow cytometry (sub-G1 51% vs. 3% and 45% vs. 0.7% in Capan-1 and PANC-1 cells,
respectively). Annexin V labelling confirmed apoptosis in 64% vs. 11% and 75%
vs. 8%, respectively. Western blotting showed cleavage of PARP-1 and caspase-3
and presence of γH2A.X. TUNEL assay showed strong staining in treated cells. These
results were mirrored following Cdc7 kinase inhibition with PHA-767491.
Conclusions: Our findings show that Cdc7 is a potent anti-cancer target in
pancreatic adenocarcinoma and that Cdc7 immunoexpression levels might be used
as a companion diagnostic to predict response to therapeutic siRNAs or SMIs directed
against this kinase.

and chemotherapy, overall survival has not improved
appreciably in the last few decades [1, 2].
An alternative approach for the treatment of
pancreatic cancer is the targeting of the DNA replication
initiation machinery which acts as a convergence point
for upstream oncogenic signaling pathways [9]. The
initiation of DNA synthesis can be regarded as a final and
critical step in growth regulatory control and therefore a
potentially potent anti-cancer target [10]. Cdc7 kinase is
a core component of this machinery and is therefore an
attractive target for therapeutic intervention strategies.
During late mitosis and early G1 phase, the replication

INTRODUCTION
Adenocarcinoma of the pancreas is one of the
top 10 leading causes of cancer deaths [1, 2]. Surgical
resection provides potential for cure but is possible
in only a minority of subjects. Even after resection,
the median survival is limited to 10–20 months and
only 10-35% of resected patients survive five years or
more [3–6]. Palliative chemotherapy is associated with
limited improvements in quality of life and survival
when compared with best supportive care [7, 8], but
despite improvements in imaging, surgical techniques

licensing factors (RLF) ORC, Cdc6, Cdt1, and Mcm2-7
assemble into prereplicative complexes (pre-RCs), which
render replication origins “licensed” for DNA synthesis
during S phase [11, 12]. The six Mcm2-7 proteins
function as a replicative helix, unwinding the template
DNA, with Cdc6 and Cdt1 acting as clamp loaders for
this ring-shaped heterohexameric complex [13–15]. At the
transition from G1 to S phase, licensed replication origins
are “fired” by the concerted action of CDKs and Dbf4dependent kinase. Cdc7 phosphorylates the Mcm 2,4 and
6 subunits, thereby inducing a conformational change
that stimulates MCM helicase activity. The formation
of an active helicase leads to recruitment of additional
factors, including Cdc45 and the four subunit GINS
complex [16–18]. Once activated the MCM helicase
unwinds double-stranded DNA at replication origins to
generate a single-stranded DNA template required to
recruit the DNA synthesis machinery including RPA,
PCNA and DNA polymerase α-primase [12]. During S
phase, Cdc7 kinase and cyclin-dependent kinases induce
a conformational change in the prereplicative complex,
resulting in recruitment of additional initiator proteins
that collectively promote DNA unwinding, recruitment of
DNA polymerases and the establishment of bi-directional
replication forks.
The interest in Cdc7 as a therapeutic target
comes from the observation that depleting Cdc7 levels
using siRNA, or alternatively inhibiting Cdc7 kinase
activity in cancer cells, results in only limited numbers
of replication forks being established during S phase,
culminating in fork stalling and/or collapse followed by
apoptotic cell death [19–22]. Intriguingly, the specificity
of this approach relates to the fact that normal somatic
cells avoid entering a lethal S phase under Cdc7 rate
limiting conditions by engaging a DNA origin activation
checkpoint response that reversibly arrests cells in G1
phase until Cdc7 levels are restored following removal of
the Cdc7 targeting agent [19, 23]. Our studies and those of
other groups have previously shown that this checkpoint
is p53 dependent [19–21, 23]. More recently we have
determined that this checkpoint is also dependent on a
number of additional tumour suppressor genes commonly
inactivated in solid tumours [23]. We have shown that
this DNA checkpoint response is mediated via three
signalling axes coordinated through the transcription
factor FoxO3a (Figure 1). In arrested cells, FoxO3a
activates the ARF-|Hdm2-|p53-p21 pathway and mediates
p15INK4B upregulation; p53 in turn activates expression
of the Wnt/b-catenin signalling antagonist Dkk3, leading
to Myc and cyclin D1 downregulation. The resulting loss
of CDK activity inactivates the Rb-E2F pathway and
overrides the G1-S transcriptional programme. Notably
we observed no redundancy in these checkpoint effector
axes, meaning that any tumours harbouring inactivating
mutations in any of the tumour suppressor genes namely
p53, p21, Dkk3, ARF, Hdm2, FoxO3a, p15, p27 and Rb
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

are susceptible to Cdc7 targeting agents. Taken together
these findings indicate that targeting Cdc7 constitutes a
synthetic lethality driven approach in tumour backgrounds
harbouring commonly mutated tumour suppressor genes.
Interestingly, inactivating mutations in p53 not only
disrupt the DNA origin activation checkpoint making
tumours susceptible to targeting of Cdc7, but also result
in increased expression of the Cdc7 anti-cancer target
thus potentially increasing therapeutic efficacy. In a
study of 62 human cancer cell lines, Cdc7 was found to
be increased in ~50% of these lines relative to β-actin
with levels in normal primary cell lines either very low
or absent [24]. Notably, a strong association between
high Cdc7 expression levels and mutated TP53 was
observed in which 90% of mutant p53 cancer cell lines
overexpressed Cdc7.
The cancer specific killing following Cdc7 targeting
has generated great interest in the development of
therapeutic Cdc7 small molecule inhibitors. For example,
PHA-767491 (Nerviano Medical Sciences, Nerviano,
Italy), a dual Cdc7/Cdk9 inhibitor, has been shown to have
activity by inducing apoptosis in a wide variety of cancer
cell lines. Furthermore, in human HL60 leukemia human
tumours implanted subcutaneously into nude mouse
models, there was inhibition of tumour growth, and even
regression of tumours in some animals, when treated with
PHA-767491 [22]. In another study, chronic lymphocytic
leukaemia (CLL) cells were taken from the peripheral
blood of patients with CLL and treated with PHA-767491.
In all samples taken from 27 different patients with both
favourable and unfavourable prognostic markers, PHA767491 induced apoptosis of the CLL cells [25].
The recent advances in our understanding of the
DNA replication initiation machinery and its clinical
translational exploitation in terms of anti-cancer therapy
raise the important question as to whether targeting
Cdc7 might be of clinical benefit in pancreatic cancer
for which therapeutic options are limited. Importantly,
70% of pancreatic adenocarcinoma tumours have been
shown to have inactivating mutations of p53, one of
the highest frequencies amongst all cancers for this
tumour suppressor [26, 27]. Moreover, pancreatic
cancers commonly harbor mutations in additional
tumour suppressor genes encoding for p14ARF and
p16INK4A, p15INK4B and p27Kip1; key constituent proteins
encompassing all three effector arms of the DNA origin
activation checkpoint [28–33]. It might therefore be
postulated that these tumours will be highly sensitive
to Cdc7 targeted therapies and secondly that the Cdc7
target protein will be expressed at high levels in this
tumour type. In this study we therefore set out to assess
expression of the target protein Cdc7 in pancreatic cancer
(target validation) and to test therapeutic anti-cancer
potential by targeting Cdc7 kinase in pancreatic cancer
cell line models using both siRNA and the PHA-767491
small molecule inhibitor (SMI) treatment strategies.

resection status presence of metastatic disease). The
association between Cdc7 expression and patient survival
was examined for a 10-point increase in labeling. No
association was seen between the Cdc7 labeling index and
patient survival in the corrected analysis (Supplementary
table).
Cdc7 expression was also compared to 3 other
markers for cell cycle progression- Mcm2, geminin
and phosphohistone H3. Spearman’s Rank correlation
coefficient was used to assess the association between
the markers with both biopsies and pancreatic resections
included. All markers were strongly associated with
one another, with P<0.0001 for each correlation
(Supplementary Figure 1). Importantly, Cdc7 was found
to be strongly positively correlated with the other markers,
confirming that actively cycling cells have high levels of
Cdc7 and that Cdc7 is a potential therapeutic target in
pancreatic ductal and ampullary adenocarcinoma.

Immunohistochemistry
Seventy three patients with pancreatic ductal
(n=62) and ampullary (n=11) cancer were included in
the study cohort with a control set of 24 patients with
benign pancreatic disease. Immunohistochemical analysis
showed markedly higher expression levels of Cdc7
protein in pancreatic ductal and ampullary cancers when
compared with benign pancreatic disease, in which Cdc7
was detected in only very small numbers of cells (median
LI 34.3%, IQR 28.6 to 63.4% vs. median LI 1.3%, IQR
0.3 to 2.9%; P<0.0001) (Figure 2).
It was found that when the Cdc7 levels were
assessed in biopsy samples and in resection samples
for pancreatic cancer, higher expression was seen in the
resection samples. To explain this. it was noted that in
biopsy specimens there was often only a small amount
of tumour tissue included, surrounded by stroma and
inflammatory cells. As the protocol was to identify the
regions with the highest expression and to photograph
these (‘hot-spot’ technique), there may have been
significant sampling error in the biopsy only specimens.
Analysis was thus carried out following adjustment for
several potential confounding variables (age, sex, tumour
differentiation, ampullary vs. pancreatic ductal origin,

p53 in turn activates expression of the Wnt/β-catenin signalling antagonist Dkk3, leading to Myc and cyclin D1 downregulation. The
resulting loss of CDK activity inactivates the Rb-E2F pathway resulting in G1 arrest. The lack of redundancy between the checkpoint axes
and reliance on several tumour suppressor proteins commonly inactivated in human tumours provides a mechanistic basis for the cancercell-specific killing observed following targeting of Cdc7. Notably multiple core components of this checkpoint pathway are mutated in
pancreatic cancer (circled in red) thus sensitizing this tumour type to Cdc7 directed agents (adapted from Tudzarova et al, EMBO J. 2010

levels were also reduced to an undetectable level as
assessed by western blot, as was Mcm2 phosphorylated
on serine 53, which serves as a biomarker for Cdc7
functionality (Figures 3A-3E and Supplementary Figure
3A-3E). Next the effect of Cdc7 depletion in both lines
was assessed by FACS flow cytometry. In Figure 3B and
Supplementary Figure 3B, DNA histograms of the CDC7
knockdown cells show the appearance of a sub-G1 peak
of cells which had less than 2C DNA content. This
effect became more pronounced over time and, after 96
hours, 45% of PANC-1 and 51% of Capan-1 cells had
accumulated in the sub-G1 peak, compared with less
than 3% of control cells.
When protein levels were analysed after 96 hours,
there was reduced Cdc7-target phosphorylation of Mcm2
on Serine 53, consistent with loss of kinase activity.
Increased expression of the cleavage products of both
PARP-1 (89 KDa) and Caspase-3 (17 KDa) was coupled
to loss of Cdc7 kinase activity indicating induction of the
classical apoptotic pathway (Figure 3E and Supplementary
Figure 3E). The triggering of apoptotoic cell death was
confirmed by the observation that H2A.X serine 139
phosphorylation (known as γH2A.X), was found to be
increased in the Cdc7 knockdown cells, compared with
the control siRNA. H2A.X is phosphorylated at this site in
response to DNA double strand breaks which occur during
genotoxic stress [41, 42].
When viewed with a phase contrast microscope,
cells treated with CDC7 siRNA appeared to lose their
normal cell-cell interactions, exhibited widespread cell

death, and became detached from the culture flasks
(Figure 4). In Figure 3C and Supplementary Figure
3C both CDC7 siRNA and CO siRNA cells stained
for BrdU, but a much smaller proportion of the CDC7
siRNA cells stained positive, indicating reduced
synthesis of new DNA and consistent with DNA fork
stalling in the presence of rate limiting levels of Cdc7
kinase activity.
Two additional methods were used to specifically
demonstrate apoptosis in the cells. Terminal deoxynucleotidyl
transferase labelling (TUNEL) recognises nicks in the
DNA molecule to which the TdT enzyme incorporates
fluorescently labelled nucleotides. TUNEL staining occurs
in cells in the later stages of apoptosis. In Figure 3D and
Supplementary Figure 3D strong staining can be seen in the
CDC7 siRNA treated cells, with all cells having at least some
staining (DAPI used as nuclear stain). In contrast no staining
in the CO siRNA treated cells was observed.
Figure 3F and Supplementary Figure 3F show
Annexin V labelled cells quantified using flow cytometry.
Annexin V recognises the phospholipid phosphatidylserine
which is translocated onto the outer cell membrane as an
early event following the triggering of apoptosis in cells.
75% and 64% (PANC-1 and Capan-1 respectively) of
the Cdc7 depleted cells were found to stain positively
for Annexin V, compared to approximately 10% of cells
treated with control siRNA.
Cells were also treated with an alternative CDC7
siRNA to control for a non-target effect shown in the
original experiments (data not shown). CDC7 knockdown

CDC7 knockdown in IMR-90 cell line

with the alternative siRNA also showed efficient reduction
in mRNA levels and protein analysis by western blot
showed the same phenotypic pattern as with the original
siRNA, with appearance of cleaved PARP-1, cleaved
Caspase-3 and γH2A.X; confirming induction of the
classical apoptotic cascade and DNA double-strand
breaks. FACS analysis demonstrated that Cdc7 depletion
with the alternative siRNA resulted in development of a
strong sub-G1 peak, compared to a negligible proportion
of cells treated with a non-coding control. These results
show that the effect of Cdc7 depletion using 2 different
CDC7 siRNAs have the same functional effect on these
cell lines.

To confirm previous observations that untransformed
cells would exhibit a G1 arrest in response to CDC7
knockdown, the IMR-90 human diploid fibroblast line
derived from fetal lung tissue was used. There was efficient
knockdown of CDC7 mRNA when using 10 nM CDC7
siRNA in IMR-90 fibroblasts. mRNA levels were reduced
by a mean of 83% in these experiments, as demonstrated by
qRT-PCR. Western blotting confirmed loss of Cdc7 protein
expression at each concentration used, with undetectable
protein by 72 hours (Figure 5A). In parallel with these
observations, Mcm2 was found to be hypophosphorylated

on serine 53 when compared to control cells, confirming
the reduced functional effect of Cdc7 kinase. There
was minimal detection of cleaved PARP-1 at 89 KDa
(none detectable at 10 nM) and no expression of
cleaved Caspase-3 or of γH2A.X (Figure 5B). On phase
contrast microscopy, cells showed significantly reduced
confluency when compared to the control cells (Figure
4). BrdU staining was almost absent in CDC7 siRNA,
indicating a powerful G1 cell cycle arrest and failure of
progression into S phase (Figure 5C). In keeping with these
observations there was a complete absence of staining by
the TUNEL assay indicating that these cells remain viable
in this arrested state and confirming previous studies with
untransformed cells lines (Figure 5D).
FACS flow cytometry showed that, in the CDC7
siRNA treated cells, there was a functional cell cycle arrest

with 85% of cells accumulating in G1 phase, and with only
1% and 9% progressing through to S and G2/M phases
respectively (Figure 5E and 5F). This was in contrast with
CO siRNA treated cells in which 59% of the population
were in G1 phase, with 14% in S phase and 26% in G2/M
phases. Only a small fraction of cells was observed with a
sub-G1 peak (5% and 1%, respectively).

detached from the culture vessel and were seen freely floating within the media. In contrast IMR90 cells treated with CDC7 siRNA or PHA767491 did not change their morphology but instead appeared to arrest growth with no increase in population.

protein phosphorylation became undetectable by western
blot analysis at the 10uM concentration in PANC-1,
and at the 2 μM concentration in Capan-1 and IMR90; these concentrations were therefore used for further
experiments. In Figure 6A, western blots are shown
for each cell line. In the Capan-1 and PANC-1 cells,
western blotting showed similar results to the CDC7
siRNA-treated cells with increased expression of cleaved
PARP-1 and Caspase-3 (89 KDa and 17 KDa fragments
respectively), as well as induction of γH2A.X expression,
a marker of advanced DNA fragmentation. IMR-90 cells,
as in previous experiments with CDC7 siRNA, showed no
evidence of activation of the apoptotic machinery.
TUNEL staining was again strongly positive in the
Capan-1 and PANC-1 treated cells, but absent in the IMR90 and DMSO treated control cells, consistent with the

findings from flow cytometry (Figure 6B). Phase contrast
microscopy showed widespread cell death of both PANC1 and Capan-1 cells treated with PHA-767491. In contrast,
IMR-90 cells treated with either PHA-767491 or CDC7
siRNA exhibited normal cell morphology but a much
smaller population of cells was observed compared with
controls consistent with a viable G1 cell cycle arrest as
observed in previous studies (Figure 4) [19, 21, 23].
In Figure 6C, the proportion of cells in sub-G1 phase
is shown on a bar chart for each cell line, showing that
by 96 hours there Cdc7 kinase inhibition was associated
with marked cell death in both the Capan-1 and PANC-1
cell lines at 96 hours, indicated by the accumulation of
cells with a sub-G1 DNA content, around 70% and 49%
for the two pancreatic cell lines respectively at the 10uM
concentration. Interestingly a dose dependent increase

In contrast to the changes seen in the cancer cells, there was no evidence of activation of the classical apoptotic pathway with no staining
for cleaved PARP-1, Caspase-3 or γH2A.X. C. BrdU assay demonstrated reduced staining of the CDC7 siRNA treated cells (top images,
green) when compared with propidium iodide (bottom images, red), whereas the control siRNA cells stained for both BrdU and PI. These
findings indicate reduced synthesis of new DNA when the cells were treated with CDC7 siRNA. D. TUNEL assay showed no evidence
of TUNEL labelling in CO siRNA or CDC7 siRNA treated cells (DAPI top, blue; TUNEL bottom, green). This assay was performed at
the same time and under the same conditions as CDC7 siRNA treatments of PANC-1 and CAPAN-1 cells, which served as the positive
control. On FACS analysis, treatment of IMR-90 fibroblasts with CDC7 siRNA F. induced an accumulation of cells in the G1 population,
compared to CO siRNA treated cells E. (85% vs. 59%). There was a minimal sub-G1 peak (5% vs. 1%) seen. These findings suggest that

potentially powerful target in the treatment of advanced
pancreatic cancer.
Interestingly, p53 inactivation not only abrogates
the DNA origin activation checkpoint but also increases
the Cdc7 protein expression levels of the target protein
itself, thus potentially reinforcing therapeutic efficacy
through a positive feedback loop [24]. Intriguingly we
have now discovered the mechanism linking loss of p53
function to increased Cdc7 levels. We have shown that
p53 is a negative regulator of Cdc7 and that this linkage
is part of the generalized p53 cellular stress response.
Following genotoxic insult it is well established that p53
levels increase resulting in induction of p21 which blocks
DNA replication initiation through inhibition of CDK2
function. We have now shown that a parallel effector
pathway blocks DNA replication initiation by lowering
Cdc7 levels. We have discovered that p53 controls Cdc7
stability post-transcriptionally via miR-192/215 and posttranslationally via Fbxw7β E3 ubiquitin ligase (Tudzarova
et al, manuscript submitted). Thus loss of p53 function
attenuates this negative regulation of Cdc7 levels and is
thus in keeping with the observation that Cdc7 levels are
raised in p53 mutant tumours [24].
In summary, we have shown that Cdc7 kinase
is highly expressed in pancreatic adenocarcinoma and
therefore a potentially attractive target in this tumour
type. Furthermore, targeting of Cdc7 in pancreatic
cancer cell line model systems with either CDC7 siRNA
or alternatively Cdc7 SMI inhibitors can induce potent
cancer cell-specific killing. Targeting Cdc7 using either of
these modalities therefore offers new exciting therapeutic
opportunities for the treatment of this aggressive disease
for which treatment options are presently limited.

DISCUSSION
The target validation and proof of concept studies
conducted here have identified Cdc7 kinase and the
associated DNA origin activation checkpoint as a
promising new therapeutic point in pancreatic cancer. We
have shown via immunohistochemistry that pancreatic
cancer specimens contain significantly higher expression
levels of the target protein Cdc7 than resected tissue from
patients with benign pancreatic disease. Furthermore, we
have also shown that the expression of Cdc7 strongly
correlates with 3 other markers for cell cycle progression
(Mcm2, geminin and phosphohistone H3) in pancreatic
cancer. Following CDC7 knockdown with siRNA,
pancreatic adenocarcinoma cells undergo pronounced
apoptotic cell death. These findings are in keeping with
the cancer-cell-specific killing observed following Cdc7
targeting in other malignancies including leukemia
and breast, ovarian and colorectal cancers [19–22, 25].
The cell lines tested, PANC-1 and Capan-1, harbour
mutations in the tumour suppressors TP53, CDKN2A,
CDKN2B and CDKN1B encoding for p53, p14ARF and
p16INK4A, p15INK4B and p27Kip1, key constituent proteins
encompassing all three arms of the origin activation
checkpoint and representing mutations commonly found
in pancreatic adenocarcinoma (Figure 1). In response to
loss of function of any of these effector proteins we have
previously shown that there is abrogation of the DNA
origin activation checkpoint [23]. This results in tumour
cells circumventing the G1 arrest thereby progressing
into an abortive S phase. In the presence of rate limiting
levels of Cdc7 kinase, only a limited number of replication
forks are established during S phase, culminating in fork
stalling and/or collapse followed by apoptotic cell death
[19–22]. Notably the potent cancer cell specific killing
observed in pancreatic cancer following Cdc7 inhibition
or depletion contrasts with the stable G1 arrest observed
in untransformed normal human diploid fibroblasts (IMR90) with an intact DNA origin activation checkpoint and
mirrors the G1 cell cycle arrest observed in previous
studies with primary untransformed cell lines [9, 21, 23].
Moreover, we have also observed a stable reversible G1
arrest in normal (HMEpC) and immortalised (MCF10A)
human mammary (HMEpC) epithelial cells following
Cdc7 depletion [19]. Taken together these data highlight
the highly specific nature of the cancer-cell-specific
killing following Cdc7 targeting and therefore make it a

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Immunohistochemistry
Between 1/1/2005 and 1/1/2010 all patients who had
had a biopsy or surgical resection sample of pancreatic
tissue at University College Hospital, London were
identified using the CoPath histology database (Sunquest,
Tucson AZ, USA). Patients were excluded if the sample
was inadequate for immunohistochemistry or if clinical
data were not available. Formalin fixed paraffin embedded
(FFPE) tissue blocks of representative tumour or benign
tissue were obtained, and consecutive serial tissue
sections were cut at a thickness of 4 μm onto Superfrost
Plus slides (Visions Biosystems, Newcastle Upon Tyne,
UK), dewaxed in xylene and rehydrated through graded
alcohol to water. The tissue sections were pressurecooked in 0.1 M citrate buffer at pH 6.0 for 2 minutes and
immunostained using the Bond Polymer Refine Detection
kit and Bond-III automated system (Vision Biosystems).
Primary antibodies were applied at the following
dilutions: Mcm2 (1:1000), geminin (1:150), H3p (1:3000)
18503

Oncotarget

and Cdc7 (1:100). Mcm2 monoclonal antibody (clone
46) was obtained from BD Transduction Laboratories
(Lexington, KY, USA), Geminin monoclonal antibody
from Leica Microsystems (Newcastle Upon Tyne, UK),
Histone H3 phosphorylated on Serine 10 (H3p) polyclonal
antibody from Upstate (Lake Placid, NY, USA), Cdc7
monoclonal antibody from MBL International (Woburn,
MA, USA).
The slides were dehydrated with graded alcohol and
then washed thrice with xylene (100% concentration).
Incubation without a primary antibody was used as a
negative control and tonsil epithelial sections as positive
controls. Slides were initially evaluated at low-power
magnification (100x) to identify the regions of tumour
with the highest intensity of staining. From these selected
areas, 3-5 fields at 400x magnification were captured with
a charged-coupled-device camera and analysis software
(SIS, Munster, Germany). Images obtained were printed
in colour for quantitative analysis. After blinding for
knowledge of clinicopathological variables, both positive
and negative cells were counted within each field and
stromal and inflammatory cells excluded. A minimum
of 500 cells were counted for each case. The Labelling
Index (LI) was then calculated for each marker using the
following formula: LI= number of positive cells/total
number of cells x100. Local research ethics committee
approval was obtained from the joint UCL/UCLH
Committees on the Ethics of Human Research (REC
reference 06/Q0512/106).

(Dharmacon, Thermo Scientific, Lafayette, CO,
USA) was used, with non-targeting siRNA (Ambion,
Invitrogen, Grand Island, NY, USA) as a negative
control. To control for a non-target effect, an alternative
CDC7 siRNA was also used with the sequence: sense
strand 5’-GCTCAGCAGGAAAGGTGTTTT-3’ and
antisense strand 5’-AACACCTTTCCTGCTGAGCTT-3’
(Dharmacon, Thermo Scientific, Lafayette, CO, USA). For
the PANC-1 and IMR-90 lines, siRNA was diluted to 10,
50 and 100 nM concentrations in Opti-MEM (Gibco), and
complexed with lipofectamine RNAiMAX (Invitrogen,
Grand Island, NY, USA) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. Due to poor efficacy of standard transfection
reagents in the Capan-1 cell line, transfection was
carried out via electroporation using the Amaxa Cell
Line Nucleofector Kit V (Lonza Cologne AG, Cologne,
Germany) with 50 and 100 nM siRNA, according to the
manufacturer’s instructions [39].

Cell culture experiments

RNA isolation and quantitative real-time
(qRT)-PCR

Cdc7 inhibitor treatment
The Cdc7/Cdk9 inhibitor PHA-767491 was supplied
as a powder which was resolved in the solvent dimethyl
sulfoxide (DMSO). In these experiments, PHA-767491
was added to the medium at concentrations of 2, 5, or 10
μM and DMSO alone was used as a control. Cells were
then reincubated at 37°C in a CO2-controlled incubator
and harvested at the defined time points as indicated
above.

Human pancreatic adenocarcinoma cell lines PANC1 (ATCC; CRL-146) and Capan-1 (Capan-1 (ATCC;
HTB-79), as well as the normal IMR-90 fibroblast line
(ATCC; CCL-186) were used. The PANC-1 and Capan-1
pancreatic adenocarcinoma cell lines were selected as they
represent cell line model systems representative of the
majority of pancreatic cancers harbouring point mutations
in the TP53 gene as well as inactivating mutations in
the tumour suppressor genes CDKN2B, CDKN2A and
CDKN1B [26, 34–38]. Cells were cultured in BD Falcon
(Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA) T75 flasks or six-well plates
in a 5% CO2 incubator at 37°C. The medium used for
culture was DMEM+ GlutaMAX™ High Glucose
(Gibco, Invitrogen, Grand Island, NY, USA) and fetal
bovine serum (Gibco) was added at a concentration of
10% (PANC-1 and IMR-90) or 20% (CAPAN-1). Each
treatment experiment was carried out in triplicate.

Following collection of the cells, total RNA
was extracted using the Purelink RNA mini kit
(Ambion, Invitrogen, Grand Island, NY, USA)
according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
The exon-flanking primer set for Cdc7 (forward,
5’-AACTTGCAGGTGGTAAAAAG-3’; and reverse,
5’-TGAAAGTGCCTTCTCCAAT-3’) was generated
using PrimerQuest (IDT, Coralville, IA, USA) and
supplied by Eurofin Genomics (Ebersberg, Germany).
Using the Superscript III Platinum SYBR Green One
Step qRT-PCR kit (Invitrogen, Grand Island, NY, USA),
RNA was reverse transcribed and amplifyed in one
step. Fluorescent PCR products were detected using
the Mastercycler ep Realplex 4 (Eppendorf, Hamburg,
Germany). The qRT-PCR protocol was as follows: a single
cDNA synthesis step case was performed at 50°C for 3
minutes; followed by a single denaturation step at 95°C for
10 minutes; then 45 cycles of denaturation at 95°C for 15
seconds, annealing at 47°C for 20 seconds and extension
at 60°C for 20 seconds. The Eppendorf Realplex Detection
System Software (Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany) was
used to determine Cycle threshold (Ct) values. GAPDH
measurements were used to normalize the data and the

relative expression of CDC7 RNA in treated samples to
untreated samples was determined.

RNase A at 37°C for 1 hour and then sorted on a Beckman
Coulter CyAN ADP flow cytometry system (Beckman
Coulter Inc., Orange County, CA, USA). The forward
scatter signal was used to trigger the detection of cells
and the PI signal fluorescence was linearly quantified to
rationalise DNA after excitation at 488 nm. PI fluorescence
was detected on the FL3/PE-Texas Red detector (613/20
nm band pass filter). Gating was carried out as described
to discount any surviving non-diploid cells.

Immunoblotting
For western blot analysis, cells were harvested and
lysed in modified RIPA buffer (50 mM Tris–HCl, 300 mM
NaCl, 1% NP40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS,
1 mM EDTA and cOmplete Mini EDTA-free protease
inhibitor cocktail by Roche Life Science) for 45 min
on ice and then sonicated for 10 seconds as previously
described [23]. Protein concentration was determined
using the Bio-Rad DC protein assay (Bio-Rad, Hercules,
CA, USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
Protein concentrations were analysed in comparison to
a pre-prepared standard curve using a MDS Analytical
Technologies SpectraMax MZ plate reader (Molecular
Devices, Sunnyvale, CA, USA). Following denaturing,
samples containing 40 μg total protein were loaded into
each well with gel loading buffer onto Novex 4-20% TrisGlycine 1.5 mm, 15 well gels (Invitrogen, Grand Island,
NY, USA). Blocking, antibody incubations and washing
steps were performed as described [40]. Protein was
transferred onto Amersham Biosciences Hybond-C Extra
membranes (GE Healthcare, Buckinghamshire, UK) by
semi-dry electroblotting at 15V for 60 minutes, according
to the manufacturer’s instructions and developed using
ECL Chemiluminescent Substrate Reagent Kit (Invitrogen,
Grand Island, NY, USA).

BrdU cell proliferation assay
Cells were cultured on coverslips in 6-well plates
and treated as described above. Treated or control cells
were pulsed with 100 μM 5-bromo-2’-deoxyuridine
(BrdU) (Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) for 1 hour
prior to harvesting. Coverslips were then washed in 1 ml
PBS and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde. The cells were
permeabilised in 0.2% Triton X for 5 minutes and 2N
HCl was added for 1 hour to denature the cellular DNA.
Coverslips were incubated in the dark at 37°C with 20 μg/
ml fluorescein conjugated anti-BrdU antibody (Millipore,
Temecula, CA, USA), 50 ng/ml PI solution and 50 ng/ml
RNaseA. The coverslips were mounted onto slides and the
cells examined with a Leica TCS SP confocal microscope.

TUNEL assay
The terminal deoxynucleotidyl dUTP nick end
labelling (TUNEL) assay was used for determining
apoptosis in the cultured cells. Cells were grown on
coverslips in 6-well plates and treated as described above.
Coverslips were removed from the cell media at the
designated time points fixed in 1% paraformaldehyde.
Cells were permeabilised by submersion in precooled
ethanol and acetic acid in a 2:1 mix for 5 minutes at
-20°C. The ApopTag Fluorescein Direct In Situ Apoptosis
Detection Kit (Chemicon, Millipore, Temecula, CA,
USA) was then used according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. The coverslips were counterstained using PI
solution and mounted onto glass slides for analysis with
the Leica TCS SP confocal microscope.

Immunoblotting antibodies
Mcm2 phospho Serine (Ser) 53 polyclonal
antibody was obtained from Bethyl Laboratories
(Montgomery, TX, USA) and used at a concentration
of 1:500; Cdc7 monoclonal antibody (clone DCS-342)
from MBL International (Woburn, MA, USA) and used
at a concentration of 1:1000; caspase 3 (CPP32 4-1-18)
monoclonal antibody from Novus Biologicals (Littleton,
CO, USA) and used at a concentration of 1:1000; cleaved
caspase 3 (Asp175) polyclonal antibody from Cell
Signaling Technology Inc. (Danvers, MA, USA) and
used at a concentration of 1:1000; PARP-1/2 (H-250)
polyclonal antibody from Santacruz Biotechnology (Santa
Cruz, CA, USA) and used at a concentration of 1:1000;
Phospho-Histone H2A.X (Ser139) Antibody from Cell
Signaling Technology Inc. (Danvers, MA, USA) and used
at a concentration of 1:1000; β-actin from Sigma Aldrich
(St. Louis, MO, USA) and used at a concentration of
1:5000.

Annexin V assay
The Annexin V assay was carried out using the
Millipore Muse Cell Analyser (Millipore, Temecula,
CA, USA), according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
Briefly, 100 μg/ml cells were pelleted, before adding
100 μl of Annexin reagent and incubated in the dark for
20 minutes at room temperature. Annexin V labelled cell
counts were then carried out in an automated fashion by
the Muse Cell Analyser.

Cell sorting (FACS analysis)
Following collection, the cells were pelleted
and fixed in 80% methanol at -20°C for at least 1 hour.
Prior to FACS, cells were incubated with FACS solution
containing 50 ug/ml propidium iodide (PI) and 50 ug/ml
