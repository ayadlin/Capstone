BACKGROUND: Despite a high radiographic response rate in patients with recurrent glioblastoma following bevacizumab therapy,
survival benefit has been relatively modest. We assess whether tumor volume measurements based on baseline and early posttreatment MRI can stratify patients in terms of progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). METHODS: Baseline (24 1/- 4
days) and posttreatment (30 1/- 6 days) MRI exams of 91 patients with recurrent glioblastoma treated with bevacizumab were retrospectively evaluated for volume of enhancing tumor as well as volume of the T2/FLAIR hyperintensity. Overall survival (OS) and
progression-free survival (PFS) were assessed using volume parameters in a Cox regression model adjusted for significant clinical parameters. RESULTS: In univariable analysis, residual tumor volume, percentage change in tumor volume, steroid change from baseline
to posttreatment scan, and number of recurrences were associated with both OS and PFS. With dichotomization by sample median
of 52% change of enhancing volume can stratify OS (52 weeks vs. 31 weeks, P 5.013) and PFS (21 weeks vs. 12 weeks, P 5.009). Residual enhancing volume, dichotomized by sample median of 7.8 cm3, can also stratify for OS (64 weeks vs. 28 weeks, P <.001) and
PFS (21 weeks vs. 12 weeks, P 5.036). CONCLUSIONS: Volumetric percentage change and absolute early posttreatment volume
of enhancing tumor can stratify survival for patients with recurrent glioblastoma receiving bevacizumab therapy. Cancer

INTRODUCTION
Glioblastoma is the most common primary malignant brain tumor in adults, with an incidence of 3.1 per 100,000 in the
United States.1 Survival in patients diagnosed with glioblastoma remains dismal despite the best available standard therapy
including surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy. In patients with recurrent glioblastoma, the median overall survival is
typically 25 to 40 weeks.2-4 With advances in our understanding of the molecular mechanisms driving tumor growth and
invasion, an increasing number of targeted therapeutic agents are being developed and evaluated.
Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) plays a key role in tumor angiogenesis, and has been a therapeutic target
in several clinical trials for various human cancers, including glioblastomas.5-7 In 2009, the humanized anti-VEGF antibody bevacizumab received US Food and Drug Administration approval for the treatment of recurrent glioblastoma due
to the observed high response rates and prolonged progression-free survival (PFS) compared to historical controls.3,8-10
More than half of patients, however, fail to respond and many of the responders inevitably develop resistance to therapy.11,12 Therefore, identification of patient subgroups that will preferentially benefit from bevacizumab therapy may
help guide therapeutic management decisions.
Although prior studies suggest that postoperative tumor volume, as well as extent of resection, have prognostic significance in newly diagnosed glioblastomas,13,14 the importance of tumor volume in patients with recurrent tumor receiving
anti-angiogenic therapy is unclear. In patients with recurrent tumor receiving bevacizumab, results from a phase 2 clinical
trial have shown that 4-week posttreatment response based on 2-dimensional criteria correlates with PFS.3 However,

neither this study nor others, to our knowledge, have
demonstrated the utility of using early posttreatment tumor volume in predicting survival.
Furthermore, recurrent glioblastomas often have
imaging components that make traditional measurements
challenging including irregular geometry, multifocality,
and cystic or necrotic regions. Volumetric methods have
the advantage of more reproducibly and precisely measuring the size of tumor,15-18 and they are being increasingly used in this setting. For example, volumetric
measurement of both the enhancing and nonenhancing
tumor have been evaluated as imaging markers for treatment response,19 PFS, and OS.15,20
In this study, we used a volumetric approach to evaluate tumor size in patients with recurrent glioblastoma
receiving bevacizumab therapy at our institution. We
assessed whether measurement of enhancing tumor volume based on MRI at baseline and 3 to 6 weeks after treatment initiation are useful predictors for PFS and OS.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients

This retrospective study was approved by the institutional
review board. Using a pharmacy database, we retrospectively identified 252 patients with pathologically confirmed glioblastoma (WHO IV) who initiated
bevacizumab at our institution between December 2005
and July 2012 with recurrence based on clinical and imaging data. Recurrence was defined by new or increased size
of enhancing tumor (> 25% bidimensional products)
based on MRI prior to bevacizumab initiation. For
patients who developed radiological progression within
12 weeks of completing radiation treatment, only patients
with progressive clinical deterioration despite steroid
treatment were included. Patients in the current study
received bevacizumab with or without concurrent chemotherapy after failing no more than 3 prior treatment regimens, including standard radiation and temozolomide
therapy, and underwent pretreatment MRI within 2
weeks of bevacizumab initiation and a follow-up MRI 3
to 6 weeks following bevacizumab initiation. Interpretable FLAIR and post-gadolinium T1-weighted (T1W)
sequences performed on either 1.5-T or 3-T MRI systems
were also required for both imaging time points.
Disease Progression Assessment

Previously published RANO criteria, including parameters for changes in T1-weighted gadolinium-enhancing
lesion, as well as nonenhancing T2/FLAIR progression,
were used to assess treatment response and disease
3480

progression.21 The dates of best response scan and progression scans were determined by a board-certified radiologist (R.H.) blinded to patients’ clinical information.
As defined by the RANO criteria, the 2-dimensional
measurements were the sum of the products of the largest
diameters and their maximum perpendicular diameters in
the axial plane. In order to quantitatively assess abnormal
T2/FLAIR signal intensity, this was also measured as the
sum of the products of the largest diameter(s) and their
maximum perpendicular diameter(s). PFS and OS were
calculated with respect to the date of bevacizumab therapy
initiation.
Tumor Segmentation and Volume Estimation

Whole-brain post-contrast T1-weighted and T2/FLAIR
images from MRI obtained at baseline and after initiating
bevacizumab were used for tumor volume segmentation.
All tumor segmentations were done using 3D Slicer software, version 4.1 (Brigham and Women’s Hospital, Boston, Mass)22,23 by an investigator (R.R.) who was blinded
to clinical outcomes. User-driven manual active contour
segmentation was used to acquire volume quantification
for the regions of interest in the enhancing tumor target(s)
as well as T2/FLAIR abnormalities. Manual editing of tumor contour was also performed to exclude nontumor
regions such as areas of intrinsic T1 shortening, necrosis,
or surgical cavity. The edited tumor contours were overlaid with source images and were evaluated in random
order by a radiologist (R.H.) who was blinded to patient
information to determine adequacy of tumor segmentation. Image volume was calculated by adding the number
of pixels within volume contour and multiplying by pixel
area and slice spacing. For multifocal tumors, the volume
of separate lesions was summed together. Hence, for each
patient, a baseline and posttreatment enhancing and “T2/
FLAIR” volume was calculated. The percentage change in
volume was calculated for both the enhancing and T2/
FLAIR volume measurements for each patient. Also, the
relative nonenhancing tumor ratio (rNTR), originally
described by Norden et al was calculated for both the
baseline and posttreatment scans, respectively.19
Statistical Analysis

The primary outcome measures for this study were PFS
and OS. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to provide
median point estimates and time specific rates. The Cox
proportional hazards model was used in univariable and
multivariable settings to identify imaging markers for PFS
and OS. Following analysis of clinical and volume parameters in this fashion, the sample was dichotomized by the

median of the sample for each volume parameter. Appropriate subanalyses were planned to account for significant
clinical variables found in the initial analysis. All of the
statistical analyses were performed using STATA, version
12.0 (Stata, College Station, Tex).

RESULTS
1.Patient clinical characteristics

A total of 91 patients (51 males) were selected using the
screening criteria. Ninety patients had initial histological
diagnosis of glioblastoma and 1 patient had a diagnosis of
gliosarcoma. Among 11 of 91 patients who initiated bevacizumab within 12 weeks of the completion of concurrent
chemoradiotherapy, tumor recurrence was supported by
pathological confirmation on repeat resection (1 patient),
detection of new satellite lesion (1 patient), PET imaging
(2 patients), or marked clinical deterioration (7 patients).
There were 12 patients with multifocal disease. Fortyseven patients were initiated on bevacizumab monotherapy, whereas 44 initiated bevacizumab with concurrent
therapy. The concurrent therapies utilized in conjunction
with bevacizumab included irinotecan (29 patients),
temozolomide (6 patients), carboplatin (2 patients), carmustine or lumustine (4 patients), plerixafor (1 patient)
and panobinostat (1 patient).
At the time of initial diagnosis, all patients were
treated with temozolomide and radiotherapy following
maximal tumor resection. The mean age of patients was
56.3 years (range, 23-88 years). Of 91 total patients, 47
patients (51%) were initiated on bevacizumab on first recurrence, 29 (32%) on second recurrence, 11 (12%) on
third recurrence and 4 (4%) on fourth recurrence. The
baseline MRI was obtained a mean of 4.0 days (64.0)
before bevacizumab initiation, and the follow-up MRI
was obtained a mean 30.0 days (66.0) after bevacizumab
initiation. In terms of steroid usage, 51 patients were
receiving dexamethasone (dose range, 0.25-24 mg; median, 4 mg) at the time of the baseline imaging. Fortynine patients were receiving dexamethasone at time of immediate posttreatment scan (dose range, 0.5-30 mg, median 4mg). There were 16 patients who had an increased
steroid dose at time of immediate posttreatment scan,
while there were 49 and 26 patients with stable and
decreased dexamethasone dosing, respectively. At the time
of analysis, 70 patients had died, and 85 patients had progressed per RANO criteria.21
The baseline clinical variables with respect to OS
and PFS are summarized in Table 1. Among clinical variables, number of recurrences and change in steroid dose

from baseline to posttreatment scan were associated with
OS and PFS.
Univariable and Multivariable Analyses of
Imaging Parameters as Continuous Variables
Adjusted for Clinical Parameters

Age, Karnofsky performance status (KPS), number of
recurrences, baseline steroid dose, change in steroid dose,
treatment regimen (bevacizumab monotherapy vs. concurrent chemotherapy), and re-resection before treatment
were included in a Cox proportional hazards model for
evaluation with each imaging-based volumetric parameter
(Table 2). Among radiologic variables, baseline enhancing
volume, posttreatment enhancing volume, percent change
in enhancing volume, and posttreatment FLAIR volume
were associated with OS and PFS. The rNTR was not predictive of OS or PFS. In multivariable analysis investigating baseline and posttreatment volume parameters,
posttreatment enhancing volume remained significantly
associated with both OS and PFS (Table 3).
Dichotomization of Volumetric Parameters by
Using Sample Median
Enhancing volume parameters versus OS and PFS

For each volume parameter, we dichotomized values by
the sample median and then calculated Kaplan-Meier estimates of overall survival. The results for dichotomized
enhancing volume parameters with hazard ratios (HR)
from Cox proportional hazards model adjusted for age,
KPS, baseline steroid use, change of steroid dose (yes or
no), number of recurrences, re-resection before treatment,
and treatment regimen (bevacizumab monotherapy vs.
bevacizumab with concurrent chemotherapies) are summarized in Table 4. When dichotomizing our sample by
median baseline enhancing volume (19.46 cm3), the baseline enhancing volume was predictive of OS (P 5 .001)
and PFS (P 5 .03, Fig. 1A). When dichotomizing our
sample by median posttreatment enhancing volume (7.8
cm3), the posttreatment enhancing volume was predictive
of OS (P < .001), as well as PFS (P 5 .036, Fig. 1B).
When dichotomizing our sample using median percentage change in enhancing volume (52%), the percentage
change was also predictive of OS and PFS (p50.013 and
p50.009, respectively; Fig. 1C).
Because a 64% reduction in enhancing volume
numerically extrapolates to a 50% reduction in
bidirectional product and therefore is equivalent as a
partial or complete response per RANO criteria,21 we also
examined this threshold in a similar analysis. Accordingly,
patients with a greater than 64% reduction in enhancing

Combined Stratifications Using Percentage
Volume Change and Residual Enhancing Tumor
Volume

To examine the value of using both percentage volume
change and residual enhancing volume, we first dichotomized the total patients group using 52% percentage
change in enhancing volume, followed by dichotomization of each subgroup based on median residual enhancing of 7.8 cm3. Kaplan-Meier estimates of overall survival
were calculated for each of these groups (Fig. 2). Based on
the Cox proportional hazards model, residual enhancing
volume was still a significant predictor of OS within the
subgroups of both responders and nonresponders,
although not a predictor of PFS. Of these 4 groups,
patients who were responders per enhancing volume
reduction, defined as a  52% response with a posttreatment enhancing volume of < 7.8 cm3 had the highest median overall survival, 70.3 weeks. The lowest median
overall survival was of patients who were nonresponders
with a posttreatment volume of > 7.8 cm3, because the
median overall survival for this group was 21.1 weeks.

5.Subgroup analyses
5a.Recurrences

Given that the number of recurrences was a significant
predictor of overall survival in univariable and multivariable analyses, we examined volume parameters in subsets
of patients at first and second recurrence, respectively.
For patients at first recurrence (n 5 47), neither
baseline enhancing volume nor percentage change were
able to stratify the sample for survival using the previously
listed median values for each parameter (P 5 .294 and
P 5 .068, respectively). Dichotomization by posttreatment enhancing volume, however, remained statistically
significant (HR 1.98, P 5 .044).
For patients at second recurrence (n529), neither
baseline enhancing volume nor percentage change were
able to stratify the sample for survival (P 5 .168 and
P 5 .289, respectively). Dichotomization by posttreatment enhancing volume, however, again remained statistically significant in patients (HR52.83, P 5 .035).

In order to account for effects of heterogeneous concurrent therapies with bevacizumab given to some patients,
we examined volume parameters among the subset of
patients who received only bevacizumab monotherapy
and those who received concurrent chemotherapy with
Kaplan-Meier estimates. For patients with bevacizumab
monotherapy (n547), baseline enhancing volume was

Patients with > 52% change or greater than 7.8 cm3 at
posttreatment were associated with longer overall survival
(P 5 .024 and P < .001, respectively) in this subset.
For patients with concurrent therapy in combination with bevacizumab (n545), only baseline enhancing
volume was able to stratify the sample for survival
(HR 5 2.14, P 5 .033). Neither percentage change of
enhancing nor posttreatment enhancing volume parameters, dichotomized by median, were able to stratify by survival (P 5 .177 and P 5 .059, respectively).
DISCUSSION
In this retrospective study, we assessed whether tumor volume parameters on pre-treatment and early posttreatment
MRI are useful predictors of survival in patients with
recurrent glioblastoma receiving bevacizumab therapy.
Our results show that residual enhancing tumor volume
and percentage change of enhancing tumor volume from
baseline are both associated with OS and PFS (Table 4).
Specifically, patients with residual enhancing tumor volume < 7.8 cm3 have a longer median PFS (20.9 weeks
versus 12.0 weeks) and OS (64.1 weeks vs. 27.7 weeks).
Similarly, patients with > 52% percentage reduction of
enhancing volume on posttreatment scan compared to
baseline also have a longer median PFS (20.9 weeks vs.
Cancer

October 1, 2013

11.9 weeks) and OS (52.3 weeks vs. 31.0 weeks). Our
results support a potential advantage for quantitative volumetric analysis early during bevacizumab treatment to
identify patients who may benefit more durably from bevacizumab therapy.
Objective response, defined as > 50% reduction in
enhancing lesion in 2D measurements following bevacizumab, has been shown to be a predictor of OS at 9, 18
and 26 weeks using data from the phase 2 BRAIN Trial,
although PFS was not found to be associated.9,24 Another
phase 2 trial of bevacizumab among heavily pretreated
patients with recurrent glioblastoma indicated that early
response at 4 weeks based on the Levin criteria is associated with a longer PFS, whereas early response based on
objective Macdonald criteria did not demonstrate the
same association.3,25 Our study indicates that early treatment response, assessed by percentage change in enhancing tumor volume before and after treatment, may serve
as a predictor for both OS and PFS. Extrapolating the percentage threshold from 3D to 2D, a 64% change in volume approximates a 50% change in 2D diameter product
and can also stratify patients with respect to PFS and OS
in our analysis. Our volumetric approach has the advantage of avoiding areas of necrosis, cysts and surgical cavity,
and may potentially estimate tumor size more accurately
than linear methods.15-17 With such measurements,
3485

Original Article

volumetric analysis allows for a quantitative method of
assessing early tumor change in size that appears to be
associated with clinical benefit from bevacizumab
treatment.
Surprisingly, the same predictive significance of percentage change of enhancing tumor was not observed in a
previous study using a volumetric approach.20 The difference in the timing of posttreatment scan may help
account for this discrepancy. Our study included patients
with a posttreatment MRI scan performed between 3 to 6
weeks (mean of 4 weeks); in contrast, the posttreatment
scan was obtained after 6 to 8 weeks in the Ellingson et al
study. It is possible that the anti-permeability effect of
bevacizumab may have had a greater impact on the measurement of enhancing tumor volume. If so, the percentage change in volume of enhancing lesion over a longer
duration may less accurately reflect underlying tumor
activity.
Residual enhancing volume appears to be associated
with OS and PFS, but it was not clear if this association was
indirectly related to percentage change in enhancing volume. Prior volumetric analysis has indicated that residual
enhancing volume at 6 to 8 weeks is associated with PFS
but not OS. To investigate potential interactions between
posttreatment and percentage volume change, we used residual enhancing volume (< or  7.8 cm3) to stratify
patients who had an early response (defined as > 52%
reduction of enhancing volume) and patients without an
early response into a total of 4 subgroups (Fig. 2). There is
significant difference in median OS between the subgroups. The difference in PFS was not significant between
the subgroups, possibly due to smaller sample size following combined stratifications. These findings suggest that
even if there is interaction between residual enhancing tumor volume and percentage volume change, the combined
use of both parameters appears to stratify patients with
respect to OS. Specifically, patients with > 52% reduction
in enhancing volume from baseline and residual enhancing
tumor volume smaller then 7.8 cm3 have the longest median survival (70 weeks). Conversely, patients with less
than 52% change in enhancing volume and residual
enhancing tumor volume larger then 7.8 cm3 have the
shortest median survival (21 weeks). Patients with > 52%
change in enhancing volume and residual enhancing tumor
volume larger than 7.8 cm3 and patients with < 52%
change in enhancing volume and residual enhancing tumor
volume smaller than 7.8 cm3 have an intermediate median
survival (28 weeks and 45 weeks, respectively).
Given the current controversy about appropriate
timing of bevacizumab treatment in patients with
3486

recurrent glioblastoma, it is important to assess volumetric parameters as a function of the number of recurrences
to better clarify their contribution to overall outcome. As
the number of recurrences was significantly associated
with OS and PFS in both univariable and multivariable
settings, we conducted an analysis stratified by this variable. In the patient subgroup with one recurrence
(n 5 47), residual enhancing tumor volume and percentage change in enhancing volume remained predictive of
OS. In patients with exactly 2 recurrences (n 5 29), only
residual enhancing volume was predictive of OS, whereas
percentage change was not. These parameters were also
mostly not significant for PFS, which may be attributable
to the relatively small sample size in each subgroup.
We also determined that baseline enhancing volume
was not predictive of OS or PFS when examining individual patient groups with different number of prior recurrences, suggesting that the observed association between
baseline enhancing volume and survival may be partly attributable to the number of prior recurrences. In addition,
while baseline enhancing volume was associated with PFS
and OS after adjusting for clinical variables, its contribution appears to be less important compared to residual
enhancing volume in multivariable analysis (Table 3).
Although baseline enhancing tumor volume may have
some prognostic value, therapy-related effect, represented
by residual and percentage change of enhancing volume,
appears to contribute more to the observed survival differences in our study. Hence, baseline enhancing tumor volume alone is likely not sufficient for selection of patients
for anti-angiogenic treatment.
Although univariable analysis indicated that posttreatment T2/FLAIR volume correlated with PFS and OS, multivariable analysis indicated that T2/FLAIR is not
significant following adjustment of clinical and other volumetric parameters (Table 3). In this sample of heavily pretreated patients, T2/FLAIR changes related to prior surgery,
radiation and chemotherapy rather than underlying tumor
activity may have contributed to measured T2/FLAIR volume. Advanced imaging techniques such as diffusion imaging may potentially increase our ability to measure actual
nonenhancing tumor volume. With the methods used in
this study, however, we were unable to show predictive ability of T2/FLAIR volume for neither OS nor PFS.
Our volumetric analysis supports the potential use
of early posttreatment imaging data in making therapy
decisions for patients with recurrent glioblastoma receiving bevacizumab therapy. If our volumetric approach to
stratification of patient survival can be validated in a prospective trial, the lack of percentage volume change or

presence of large residual posttreatment tumor volume
could be incorporated into clinical decision making.
Patients who do not demonstrate early percentage change
of volume or have large residual tumor volume may
require modification of therapy regimen.
Limitations

First, as a retrospective analysis, our study findings require
prospective evaluation. In this study, we cannot determine
whether the predictive nature of residual and percentage
change of enhancing volume would be applicable for
patients with recurrent glioblastoma who do not receive
antiangiogenic therapy. To determine whether the volumetric imaging markers are specific to antiangiogenic
therapy, the same analysis should be investigated in recurrent glioblastoma patients treated with nonantiangiogenic therapy. Although every patient in this
study was initiated on a treatment regimen including bevacizumab, nearly half were also given concurrent chemotherapy. Subgroup analysis of patients who only received
bevacizumab monotherapy indicated that dichotomization using residual and percentage change of enhancing
volume were still significant predictors of OS and PFS.
The significance of tumor volume parameters as imaging
predictors in the setting of different therapy regimens
should be confirmed in prospective trials.
The distinction of pesudoprogression and progression is important, as the misclassification of pseudoprogression as recurrence before bevacizumab treatment can
affect outcome assessment. Although we cannot definitively exclude the possibility of including cases pseudoprogression based on our selection criteria, we believe the
impact is relatively small because the majority (84/91) of
patients demonstrated radiological progression at least 12
weeks after completion of radiation treatment or evidence
of increased metabolic activity on PET imaging and
distant enhancing disease outside the irradiated region.
The MRI sequence used to assess tumor volume in
our study has an inter-slice thickness of 5 mm, potentially
introducing partial volume averaging during the tumor
segmentation. Although high-resolution 3D T1-weighted
MR images would be expected to allow for a more precise
volume measurement, a prior study indicated that performing volumetric analysis on traditional 2D imaging, as
done in this study, leads to comparable measurements.26
Nonetheless, if quantitative volumetric analysis is to be
implemented clinically to assist individual outcome prediction, tumor volume measurement based on 3D source
imaging will likely be preferred. With advances in imaging acquisition speed, 3D T1- and T2-weighted whole

brain image sequences are increasingly acquired in both
trial and clinical settings and will be helpful in allowing
for more accurate volume measurements.
Conclusions

We assessed baseline and early posttreatment volumetric
parameters from T1-weighted and T2-weighted MRI
imaging to evaluate their ability to predict OS and PFS in
patients with recurrent glioblastoma being initiated on
bevacizumab therapy. Volumetric percentage change and
early posttreatment volume of enhancing tumor can stratify survival for patients with recurrent glioblastoma receiving bevacizumab therapy.
