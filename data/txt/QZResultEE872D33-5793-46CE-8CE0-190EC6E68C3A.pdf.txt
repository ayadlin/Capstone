ABSTRACT
Multiply myeloma (MM) grows in and destroys bone, where osteocytes secrete
FGF23, a hormone which affects phosphate homeostasis and aging. We report that
multiple myeloma (MM) cells express receptors for and respond to FGF23. FGF23
increased mRNA for EGR1 and its target heparanase, a pro-osteolytic factor in MM.
FGF23 signals through a complex of klotho and a classical FGF receptor (FGFR); both
were expressed by MM cell lines and patient samples. Bone marrow plasma cells from
42 MM patients stained positively for klotho, while plasma cells from 8 patients with
monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) and 6 controls were
negative. Intact, active FGF23 was increased 2.9X in sera of MM patients compared
to controls. FGF23 was not expressed by human MM cells, but co-culture with mouse
bone increased its mRNA. The FGFR inhibitor NVP-BGJ398 blocked the heparanase
response to FGF23. NVP-BGJ398 did not inhibit 8226 growth in vitro but significantly
suppressed growth in bone and induction of the osteoclast regulator RANK ligand,
while decreasing heparanase mRNA. The bone microenvironment provides resistance
to some anti-tumor drugs but increased the activity of NVP-BGJ398 against 8226
cells. The FGF23/klotho/heparanase signaling axis may offer targets for treatment
of MM in bone.

INTRODUCTION

affinity for heparin sulfate, which recruits ligands to FGF
receptors (FGFRs). Assembly of FGFRs 1, 3 or 4 with
transmembrane klotho forms specific receptors for FGF23
[2]. FGF23 acts on FGFR/klotho-expressing kidney tubule
cells, where it regulates phosphate homeostasis and
maintains the concentration of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D
in its normal physiological range. Loss of FGF23 signaling
may account for much of the aging phenotype of klothodeficient mice, consequent to hyperphosphatemia and
hypervitaminosis D, which can be ameliorated by dietary
or genetic manipulations [3].
Klotho was discovered when an accidental gene
inactivation in mice caused premature aging [4]. Klotho
is an evolutionarily conserved protein with membraneanchored and secreted forms and two major duplicated
glycosyl hydrolase domains. In addition to serving as an

Multiple myeloma (MM) is a hematological
malignancy in which osteolytic bone disease due to tumor
stimulation of osteoclasts and suppression of osteoblasts
causes severe morbidity and is associated with poor
prognosis [1]. Palliative treatments for MM bone disease
rely on inhibitors of osteolysis such as bisphosphonates
or RANK ligand-neutralizing antibody. Crosstalk between
MM cells and bone remains incompletely understood,
and direct molecular interactions between myeloma and
factors unique to the bone microenvironment have not
been described.
Osteocytes are the most abundant cell type within
bone and source of the endocrine hormone FGF23. Unlike
most fibroblast growth factors (FGFs), FGF23 lacks high

FGF specificity co-receptor, klotho can inhibit insulin/
IGF-1, Wnt and TGFβ signaling, suppress oxidative stress,
and alter the activity of the TRPV5 calcium channel [58]. Over 80 publications have studied klotho in a variety
of cancer types, with actions including effects on aging,
inhibition of IGF-1, FGF2 and TGFβ signaling and tumor
suppressor function [9, 10]. Tumor cells were not tested in
these papers for the major physiological function of klotho
to mediate cellular responses to FGF23.
FGFR signaling regulates the growth and
progression of many cancers including MM [9], but a role
for FGF23 in MM has not been reported. Since FGF23 is
secreted by osteocytes, high concentrations of the factor
will occur in the bone microenvironment - leading us to
test a role for FGF23 in MM bone disease by asking if
MM cells express receptors for and respond to FGF23.

FGF23 increases EGR1 and heparanase
Bone-metastatic breast and other cancer cell lines
often express klotho [9], but tumor responses to FGF23
have not been reported. We asked whether MM cell lines
responded to FGF23. FGF23 did not affect growth of MM
cells in vitro (Supplementary Figure S1). In kidney tubules,
FGF23 increases the early gene response transcription
factor EGR1 [11]. When MM cell lines were treated with
100ng/ml FGF23, EGR1 mRNA was increased 2-10X at
1 hour and declined by 4 hours in RPMI-8226 and JJN3
(Figure 1A and 1C) and three additional MM cell lines
(Supplementary Figure S2). A literature search for EGR1responsive genes with roles in cancer and bone identified
heparanase [12], an enzyme that significantly contributes
to myeloma bone disease [13]. Heparanase mRNA was

increased in RPMI-8226 and JJN3 cells 18-fold and 4-fold
respectively by FGF23 (Figure 1B and 1D). We focused
on these two human MM cell lines, since they cause
osteolytic bone destruction in mouse models [14, 15].
Heparanase mRNA was unchanged in three other MM cell
lines (Supplementary Figure S2). The t5 alternate form of
heparanase found in renal cancers [16] was not increased
by FGF23 (Supplementary Figure S3).

also expressed mRNAs encoding at least two of the three
FGFRs that couple to klotho (Supplementary Figure S5).

Serum intact FGF23 is increased in MM
Mean Intact FGF23 concentrations were 2.9 fold
higher in 33 newly diagnosed MM patients compared to
186 controls (106 ± 157 pg/ml and 36 ± 17 pg/ml; p <
0.0001) (Figure 3A). MM is a relatively rare malignancy:
our patient population was sufficient to provide statistical
significance, but not large enough to show differences
between subgroups when the MM samples were stratified
according to degree of bone involvement (Supplementary
Figure S6). To test if myeloma cells were a source of
circulating FGF23, cell lines and primary MM cells were
analyzed by real-time PCR. FGF23 messenger RNA was
undetectable (four myeloma cell lines, Figure 3B) or much
lower (four primary patient samples, Figure 3C) than the
positive bone control.

MM cells express klotho
FGF23 signals by high affinity binding to complexes
between a classical FGFR and klotho [2]. FGFRs are
abundantly expressed in MM [17], but klotho has not
been reported in myeloma cells, which we next tested.
Bone marrow clots and aspirate smears from 42 patients
with MM, 8 subjects with MGUS and 6 normal controls
were stained with klotho antibody. Normal kidney was the
positive control, with distal convoluted tubules staining
intensely (Figure 2A). Klotho immunostaining was seen
in plasma cells in all myeloma cases (Figure 2B and 2C).
Klotho was localized to the cytoplasm of MM (Figure
2D) as punctate granules. In MGUS, there was minimal
to no cytoplasmic staining in occasional plasma cells
(Figure 2E) and no staining of plasma cells in normal bone
marrow (Figure 2F). Compared to non-MM plasma cells,
klotho expression by MM cells was significantly increased
(p < 0.01, Figure 2G) when staining was scored blind on
a standard scale. No relationship was observed between
percent MM cells in bone marrow and intensity of klotho
staining. No significant association was observed between
the klotho staining and disease features, including staging
and extent of bone involvement.

Co-culture with MM increases FGF23 expression
in bone
The co-culture assay modifies a standard procedure
for growing mouse bone ex vivo [19], by the addition of
human tumor cells [20]. We adapted it for MM cell lines
and analyzed changes in tumor and bone markers after
one week by species-specific real-time PCR to distinguish
between mouse bone and human MM mRNAs. RPMI8226 or JJN3 human MM cells significantly increased
mouse FGF23 mRNA 2-fold and 5-fold respectively,
compared to bones without added MM cells (Figure 4).

Serum klotho is unchanged in MM

FGFR inhibition affects tumor growth

We asked if serum soluble klotho was altered in
MM, using an ELISA that recognizes secreted and shed
forms [18]. Detection of both forms was confirmed
with supernatants from cultures of breast cancer cells
transfected with membrane-bound, secreted (549 amino
acid) or the 980 amino acid extracellular domain of klotho
(Supplementary Information). High concentrations of
klotho were found in similar amounts in media from cells
expressing each of the forms of klotho (data not shown).
Soluble klotho concentrations did not differ (p = 0.39)
between MM patients (n = 33, mean ± SD = 670 ± 458 pg/
ml) and controls (n = 43, 598 ± 269 pg/ml) (Figure 2H).
Concentrations of soluble klotho were below the limit of
detection (<6.15 pg/ml) in media conditioned by four MM
cell lines (data not shown). We found klotho mRNA in
four human MM cell lines (Figure 2I) and purified CD138+
primary cells from four patients (Figure 2J). The cell lines
expressed both membrane and secreted klotho mRNAs
(Supplementary Figure S4). Patient samples and cell lines

Next we tested if an inhibitor of FGF23 signaling
altered myeloma growth in bone. The dose-response to
FGF23 was first determined in vitro. FGF23 at 3ng/ml
(1.2x10-10M) significantly induced heparanase mRNA
(Figure 5A). The pan-selective FGFR inhibitor NVPBGJ398 dose-dependently blocked the response to 10ng/
ml FGF23 (Figure 5B), from which we chose 25 or 40nM
(14 or 22ng/ml) to test against growth of MM cells stably
secreting Gaussia luciferase [21] to follow tumor burden
[22]. The drug dose-dependently inhibited growth of JJN3
cells in vitro at 7 days (Figure 5C), while 25nM decreased
MM activity in bone over the same time (Figure 5D).
In contrast, RPMI-8226 cells were resistant to 40nM
inhibitor in vitro (Figure 5E), but the same concentration
significantly decreased their activity in bone (Figure 5F).

No statistically significant association was observed between the klotho staining and disease features, including staging
and extent of bone involvement. In our sample set where most patients have normal or mild renal insufficiency (based on
serum creatinine and Cockroft-Gault Estimated GFR), we did not observed a correlation between serum intact FGF23 and
serum klotho, serum creatinine, Cockcroft-Gault calculated GFR, or serum phosphate levels (p>0.05). In 15 cases where
both serum and bone marrow samples were available, there was no correlation between serum klotho concentrations and
klotho expression by immunostaining.

FGFR inhibition alters MM and bone gene
expression

(Figure 6C), while NVP-BGJ398 had a modest effect to
oppose the increase of FGF23 in the presence of MM
cells (Figure 6D). Finally, we found that the pan-FGFR
inhibitor decreased the FGF23 target heparanase in the
two MM cell lines grown in bone, when analyzed by
Q-PCR with human-specific primers (Figure 6E).

Finally, we asked if FGF signaling inhibition altered
bone responses to tumor. The co-cultures from Figure 5D
and 5F were processed for RNA isolation and analyzed
by Q-PCR with mouse-specific primers for bone markers:
RANKL, the central regulator of osteoclastogenesis
(Figure 6A) and tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase
(TRAP) a major osteoclast enzyme (Figure 6B) were
increased by myeloma cells. The increase in RANKL
was opposed by NVP-BGJ398 treatment. TRAP was less
affected, but osteoclast activity may have peaked before
day 7 when the cultures were assayed. Type 1 collagen,
a major product of metabolically active osteoblasts was
increased by drug treatment in the presence of MM cells

DISCUSSION
Greater than 80% of patients with multiple myeloma
develop osteolytic bone disease, due to osteoclast
activation and osteoblast suppression, leading to skeletalrelated events, including severe bone pain, vertebral
compression and pathologic fractures [1]. No specific
molecular actions on MM by factors unique to bone have
been reported previously, prompting us to ask if such
factors might contribute to myeloma growth in bone. We

focused on osteocytes as the most abundant cell type in
the skeleton and main source of bone-derived endocrine
factors, including FGF23 [23].
To test if FGF23 activates signaling in myeloma
cells, we assessed EGR1, an early response transcription
factor induced by FGF23 in kidney tubules [11]. EGR1
mRNA was rapidly increased in five MM cell lines
(Figure 1A and 1C and Supplementary Figure S2A, S2C
and S2E), while growth or apoptosis in vitro of three
human MM cell lines was unaffected by FGF23 treatment
(Supplementary Figure S1 and data not shown). EGR1
transcriptionally regulates a plethora of genes in many
cell types [24]. In prostate cancer it is tumorigenic and
pro-metastatic, activating secretion of growth factors and
enzymes that modify extracellular matrix. A significant
transcriptional target of EGR1 is heparanase [12, 25],
a central regulator of osteolysis and growth in bone of
myeloma and solid tumors [13] (additional references in
Supplementary Information). FGF23 strongly increased
heparanase in RPMI-8226 and JJN3 MM cell lines (Figure
1B and 1D). The short, alternative t5 form of heparanase
expressed by renal cancers [16] was not increased by
FGF23 (Supplementary Figure S3). The results show
that FGF23 has direct actions on MM cells. In prostate
or breast adenocarcinoma and colon carcinoma cell lines
de Mestre et al [12] observed that heparanase mRNA was
increased at 24hrs, by which time EGR1 mRNA (stimulate
by PMA treatment of the cells) had returned to baseline
- as expected for an early response gene. In Figure 1 we
observed the same temporal relationship between EGR1
and heparanase in FGF23-treated MM cell lines. The MM
cell lines that did not show increased heparanase mRNA
upon treatment (Supplementary Figure S2) expressed
much higher basal message than the JJN3 and RPMI-8226
cell lines that showed strong induction of heparanase by
FGF23.
Heparanase is a centrally important regulator of
metastases, tumor microenvironment interactions, and
bone metabolism via actions on many targets [25, 26].
High heparanase is an indicator of poor prognosis in MM
[27]. It increases local expression of proteases [28] and
RANK ligand [13], the central regulator of osteoclasts.
It also suppresses osteoblast activity [29] - a hallmark of
myeloma bone disease [1].
We asked if myeloma cells express FGF23
receptors [11]. FGF23 lacks high affinity for heparan
sulfate proteoglycans, which increase FGFR affinity for
conventional FGF ligands. Instead, a C-terminal extension
of FGF23 confers high affinity for the klotho:FGFR
complex [2]. Klotho is expressed in many tumor types,
increasing with progression in ovarian cancer [30] while
decreasing in breast cancer [10]. MM express FGFRs
[17, 31], but klotho expression has not been reported.
We found klotho IHC staining in all MM samples tested,
while a small sample of normal plasma cells and MGUS
bone marrow aspirates was negative (Figure 2B-2G) with
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

a well-characterized monoclonal antibody [32] previously
used in kidney (Figure 2A) and in small cell lung cancer
samples [33]. While klotho is a transmembrane protein, its
immunostaining was frequently intracellular (Figure 2D).
The klotho:FGFR complex could be endocytosed upon
ligand binding, causing the punctate cytoplasmic staining
observed. Figure 2G suggests that klotho expression (and
potential FGF23-responsiveness) may be a hallmark
of the transformation of plasma cells into MM. Normal
plasma cells from additional patients need to be analyzed
to confirm this. FGF23 signaling ensues when ligand
binds to klotho plus FGFRs 1, 3 or 4 [34]. Four standard
human MM cell lines and four primary patient samples
all expressed klotho mRNA (Figure 2I and 2J). CD138+
primary MM cells expressed FGFRs 3 and 4 but not
significant amounts of FGFR1, while the cell lines RPMI8226 and JJN3 expressed FGFRs 1 and 4 (Supplementary
Figure S5), predicting that all should be responsive to
FGF23.
Stewart et al previously reported that serum FGF23
levels were increased in patients with myeloma and
correlated with serum paraprotein [35]. The authors’
ELISA used polyclonal antibodies against C-terminal
epitopes, consequently detecting both biologically active
intact FGF23 and inactive C-terminal fragments [36].
Only intact FGF23 activates the membrane klotho:FGFR
complex. C-terminal fragments may compete with intact
FGF23 for receptor binding and have antagonist functions
[37]. Imel et al demonstrated that in healthy subjects,
C-terminal FGF23 concentrations are frequently elevated
when intact FGF23 and phosphorus concentrations remain
normal [38]. Thus C-terminal FGF23 and intact assays
provide different information. We found increased intact
FGF23 (Figure 3A) in MM serum but cannot exclude
the presence of inactive FGF23 fragments. Stewart et al
[35] proposed that MM cells make FGF23 on the basis
of immunostaining, which could be due to binding of
exogenous FGF23 to receptors or nonspecific binding.
Ectopic FGF23 expression has only been reported in rare
mesenchymal tumors associated with hypophosphatemic
tumor-induced osteomalacia, due to renal phosphate
loss [39] - a feature not seen in myeloma. We failed to
detect significant amounts of FGF23 mRNA in MM cell
lines or primary MM samples (Figure 3B and 3C). Our
CD138-positive primary cells were rapidly purified by
cell sorting from marrow aspirates to decrease bone cell
contamination as a source of FGF23. It is not possible to
distinguish myeloma cells being devoid of FGF23 mRNA
but contaminated with bone cells, versus low expression
of FGF23 by MM cells. A larger controlled study is
required to resolve this issue. We conclude that MM cells
are not a significant source of FGF23. We did not observe
differences in FGF23 levels between groups with different
degrees of bone involvement (Supplementary Figure
S6). The relationship of serum FGF23 to extent of bone
involvement needs to be tested in a larger cohort of MM

patients using accurate assessment of bone involvement.
The presence of myeloma cells could stimulate
osteocyte secretion of FGF23, leading to its elevation
in patient sera. We tested if MM cells increased bone
production of FGF23, using a novel ex vivo assay where
tumor cells are added to primary bone organ cultures [19].
Neonatal mouse calvariae are immune-naïve and support
growth of human solid tumor cell lines [20] that cause bone
metastases in mouse models. We added small numbers of
MM cells and monitoring gene changes in tumor cells
(human) and bone cells (mouse) by real-time PCR with
species-specific primers [40] to distinguish the cellular
source of mRNAs in the mixed species co-cultures. Bone
expression of FGF23 mRNA was significantly increased
2-5 fold after one week of co-culture with myeloma
cells (Figure 4). Thus, increased circulating FGF23 in
patients may result from MM stimulation of osteocytes.
Studies are under way to identify myeloma-derived
factors that increase FGF23 production. Other factors that
might affect circulating FGF23 concentrations include
bisphosphonates, renal function and iron status. However,
patient bisphosphonate use decreases FGF23 [41]. Despite
high intact FGF23 levels, serum phosphate concentrations
were largely normal in our sample set, suggesting that
other factors maintain phosphate homeostasis. Iron
deficiency correlates with elevated C-terminal FGF23
[42]. Imel et al reported, in a study of autosomal dominant
hypophosphatemic rickets (ADHR), that low serum
iron was associated with elevated C-terminal but not
intact FGF23 in control subjects, while increased intact
molecule was also negatively correlated with iron in
ADHR patients. The results suggest that FGF23 cleavage
is a compensatory mechanism to maintain active FGF23
in the normal range [38]. MM-related anemia is due to
impaired iron utilization, rather than low iron per se [43],
with most MM patients having normal or high iron status,
making it unlikely to explain high FGF23. Parathyroid
hormone receptor activation increases bone expression of
FGF23 [44], and MM cells may secrete its ligand, PTHrP
[45]. Factors that can influence FGF23 levels should be
explored in a larger cohort of MM patients, including
1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D, PTHrP, other FGFs, low pH and
high serum phosphate/calcium ratio [46].
To test a role for FGF23 in myeloma bone disease,
we used the pan-FGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor NVPBGJ398, which rapidly normalized phosphate and
enhanced bone growth - with increased mineralization
and normalization of growth plate structure - in a
mouse model of ADHR, where elevated FGF23 causes
hypophosphatemia [47]. NVP-BGJ398 effectively blocked
the heparanase response of MM cells in vitro to 10ng/ml
FGF23 (Figure 5B). JJN3 MM cells were highly sensitive
to growth inhibition in vitro by NVP-BGJ398 and were
also growth inhibited in bone co-culture, while 40nM
NVP-BGJ398 had no effect on the growth of RPMI-8226
cells in standard tissue culture but blocked their growth in
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

bone, as monitored by secreted luciferase marker (Figure
5E versus 5F). The bone microenvironment frequently
confers resistance to treatment; therefore the increased
sensitivity of 8226 to NVP-BGJ398 in bone compared
to in vitro is of particular interest. It suggests that FGF
targeting may alter the bone microenvironment, making it
hostile to tumor growth - although NVP-BGJ398 showed
few effects on bone alone. In MM:bone cocultures, it
decreased tumor RANKL, increased osteoblastic activity
(type 1 collagen) and decreased osteocyte FGF23 - which
in turn should decrease tumor heparanase. Additional work
is needed to determine if NVP-BGJ398 acts primarily
through direct blockade of FGF23 signaling or indirectly
through other actions on tumor, bone, or both.
NVP-BGJ398 and several other pan-FGFR kinase
inhibitors are in clinical development for cancer treatment
[31, 48]. Inhibition of FGFR signaling in MM has focused
on cells carrying activating FGFR3 mutations that cause
‘addiction’ to FGFR signaling and confer sensitivity
to FGFR inhibitors. A recent clinical trial of Dovitinib,
a multikinase inhibitor with activity against FLT3/cKit, FGFR1/3 and VEGFR1-4 kinases, in patients with
relapsed or refractory MM showed marginal efficacy
in subjects with or without FGFR3 mutations [49]. The
reason for the treatment failure is unclear, and correlative
data on FGFR inhibition were not reported. Participating
patients were heavily pretreated and some died quickly
due to disease progression; so the results do not exclude
FGFRs as viable targets for MM treatment. We chose
NVP-BGJ398 on the basis of its ability to block FGF23 in
an animal model, where it caused anabolic bone responses
[47] - which could contribute to the antitumor effects
seen in bone. NVP-BGJ398 and other tyrosine kinase
inhibitors selective for FGFRs, including LY2874455,
SSR128129E, AZD4547 and PD173074, are in early
clinical development for solid tumors. FGF signaling is
complex and variable in different tumors at different stage.
Better understanding of FGF signaling in MM and bone
should clarify the potential of FGFR inhibitors for MM
treatment.
Our results suggest that FGF23 from skeletal
osteocytes drives a vicious cycle [50] of myeloma
growth in bone by binding to MM cells and activating
transcription of pro-metastatic and pro-osteolytic genes,
such as heparanase. Future research is needed to identify
additional genes regulated by FGF23 and to clarify
the mechanisms by which MM systemically increases
active FGF23 in patients. The action of FGF23 on MM
cells identifies targets for intervention against myeloma
bone disease, including heparanase antagonists [51, 52],
FGF23-neutralizing antibodies [53] and FGFR kinase
inhibitors [48], now entering clinical trials.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Cockroft-Gault equation. Serum phosphate was measured
with a Roche COBAS Mira S (Roche Diagnostics),
using reagents from Thermo Scientific. Serum phosphate
values >6ng/dl were presumed to be secondary to either
hemolysis or interference with the analytical reading by
excess monoclonal protein and were excluded. 25 MM
subjects had assessable serum phosphates.

Cell lines and materials
Human MM cell lines RPMI-8226, U266, NCI-H929
and MM.1s and human breast cancer cell lines MCF-7
and MDA-MB-231 were from the ATCC and grown in
recommended media. JJN3 human MM cells were from
Professor N. Giuliani, University of Parma. Recombinant
human FGF23 was from R&D Systems Inc. Anti-klotho
antibody KM2076 is a rat IgG(2)a monoclonal antibody
raised against residues 55-261 of human klotho protein
[32] and was generously provided by Kyowa Hakko Kirin
Co. Ltd., Tokyo; it is now available commercially. NVPBGJ398 was from ChemieTek, Indianapolis, IN.

Immunohistochemistry
Procedures used solutions, instruments and protocols
from Dako. Sections were cut and placed on positivelycharged slides. After removal of paraffin and washing
with distilled water, the slides underwent antigen retrieval
using Target Retrieval high pH solution for 20 min at
90oC and blocking for 20 min with serum-free protein
block solution before adding anti-klotho antibody 2076
(1:500) for 20 min. The secondary antibody was donkey
anti-rat IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (1:10,
Jackson ImmunoResearch Labs) for 10 min, followed
by 10 min incubation with EnVision™ FLEX+ highsensitivity visualization system in an Autostainer. Five
min after addition of 3,3’-diaminobenzidine chromogenic
reagent, the slides were counterstained with hematoxylin
and examined under a Leica bright field microscope. Five
microscopic fields with the highest immunoreactivity were
evaluated independently by three investigators in blinded
fashion. At least 1,000 cells were analyzed per slide. The
number of positively-staining cells was estimated, and the
intensity of staining was scored on a scale of 0 to 3+ (0,
no staining; 1, weak staining; 2, moderate staining; and 3,
strong staining). Kidney was the positive control.

Human specimens
All patient materials were used with informed
consent and HIPAA compliance with a protocol approved
by the Indiana University Institutional Review Board.
Previously frozen serum samples obtained at diagnosis
were available from 33 MM patients (Table 1). Serum
FGF23 and soluble klotho data for healthy controls were
previously analyzed by one of the authors (EAI) and used
for comparison with myeloma samples. Serum klotho
results were available from 43 and FGF23 from 186
control subjects [38]. Klotho in bone marrow plasma cells
was evaluated in paraffin-embedded bone marrow clots,
bone marrow aspirate smears and tonsil tissues from the
histology archives of the Department of Pathology. Bone
marrow specimens from 42 newly diagnosed MM patients,
8 MGUS patients, 6 healthy controls, and two normal
tonsils were stained for klotho immunohistochemistry
(IHC). Of these 42 patients, 15 had corresponding serum
samples at the time of diagnosis available for klotho
and FGF23 analyses. Patient clinical parameters are
summarized in Table 1.

RNA and PCR
Tumor cells (104/well) were grown in RPMI1640
medium and treated with FGF23, collected by
centrifugation and washed in phosphate-buffered
saline (PBS). Plasma cells were isolated from bone
marrow aspirates using magnetic beads that bind
CD138 (syndecan-1)-positive cells, according to the
manufacturer’s instructions (Miltenyi Biotech), yielding
> 90% pure CD138+ cells by flow cytometry. RNAs were
extracted from cells from four patients and from MM
cell lines using Qiagen RNeasy mini kits with DNAse
treatment, converted to cDNA using Omniscript RT kits
(Qiagen) with 16mer oligo(dT) primer and analyzed in
triplicate by real-time (Q-)PCR using Qiagen Quantitect
SYBR green PCR kits and a Biorad iCycler single-color
real-time detection system. Ribosomal protein L32 was the
normalization control [40]. The sequences, design strategy
and validation for PCR primer sets are given in the
Supplementary Information. For species-specific PCRs,
primer sets were tested against mouse and human positive
templates until sets that give 1000:1 specificity were found

Serum assays
Intact FGF23 was assayed as described [54] using
ELISA kits from Kainos Laboratories (Tokyo, Japan) with
a lower limit of detection of 3pg/ml and coefficient of
variation of 6%. The assay recognizes only intact FGF23
via monoclonal antibodies for epitopes on opposite sides
of the FGF23 R176XXR179 cleavage site. Soluble klotho in
sera and conditioned media was assayed using an ELISA
(IBL-America), with a lower limit of detection of 6.15pg/
ml and coefficient of variation of 5% [18]. Creatinine,
calcium and alkaline phosphatase were measured in the
clinical pathology laboratory using standard methods.
Glomerular filtration rates were calculated using the

Co-culture of MM cells with bone
MM cell lines were transduced with lentiviral
particles from GenTarget, according to the manufacturer’s
instructions, with a vector encoding secreted Gaussia
luciferase driven by a CMV promoter, plus a GFPblasticidin fusion protein cassette. GFP+ MM cells were
isolated by fluorescence-activated cell sorting. Segments
of neonatal mouse bone were prepared by a modification
of Mohammad et al [19]. Calvariae from euthanized 11
to 14 day-old mouse pups were cut into 4mm disks with
a biopsy punch and placed into uncoated 24-well plates.
Luciferase-secreting GFP-MM cells (1x104) were added
in 0.5ml BGJb medium (Life Technologies) supplemented
with 20% fetal calf serum, 500nM human insulin and
100µM ascorbic acid. Plates were incubated at 37°C in 5%
CO2. Medium was changed every 2-3 days and assayed for
luciferase as an indicator of tumor burden [21, 22] with a
BioLux® Gaussia luciferase flex kit (NE BioLabs) and
a Turner TD 20/20 luminometer. Results were expressed
as relative luminescence units (RLUs). At day 7, bones
were washed in PBS, placed in 1.0ml of Qiazol (Qiagen)
and homogenized for 1 min with zirconium beads in a
BeadBug microtube homogenizer (Benchmark Scientific)
at 280 strokes/min, followed by RNA isolation.
