ABSTRACT
Purpose: Receptor tyrosine kinase AXL (RTK-AXL) is regarded as suitable target
in glioma therapy. Here we evaluate the anti-tumoral effect of small molecule inhibitor
BMS-777607 targeting RTK-AXL in a preclinical glioma model and provide evidence
that RTK-AXL is expressed and phosphorylated in primary and recurrent glioblastoma
multiforme (GBM).
Experimental design: We studied the impact of BMS-777607 targeting RTK-AXL in
GBM models in vitro and in vivo utilizing glioma cells SF126 and U118MG. Impact on
proliferation, apoptosis and angiogenesis was investigated by immunohistochemistry
(IHC) and functional assays in vitro and in vivo. Tumor growth was assessed with
MRI. Human GBM tissue was analyzed in terms of RTK-AXL phosphorylation by
immunoprecipitation and immunohistochemistry.
Results: BMS-777607 displayed various anti-cancer effects dependent on
increased apoptosis, decreased proliferation and migration in vitro and ex vivo in
SF126 and U118 GBM cells. In vivo we observed a 56% tumor volume reduction in
SF126 xenografts and remission in U118MG xenografts of more than 91%. The tube
formation assay confirmed the anti-angiogenic effect of BMS-777607, which became
also apparent in tumor xenografts. IHC of human GBM tissue localized phosphorylated
RTK-AXL in hypercellular tumor regions, the migratory front of tumor cells in pseudopalisades, and in vascular proliferates within the tumor. We further proved RTK-AXL
phosphorylation in primary and recurrent disease state.
Conclusion: Collectively, these data strongly suggest that targeting RTK-AXL
with BMS-777607 could represent a novel and potent regimen for the treatment of
primary and recurrent GBM.

INTRODUCTION

to understand the mechanisms of gliomagenesis and
malignancy criteria of GBMs. Current investigations aim
to uncover novel therapeutic approaches by exploring the
oncogenic mechanisms and unique potential targets of
GBMs [4].
The receptor tyrosine kinase AXL (RTK-AXL)
displays a new promising target in glioma therapy [5].
RTK-AXL is characterized by an extracellular domain
consisting of two immunoglobulin-like domains in
juxtaposition of two fibronectin type III domains, typical

Malignant gliomas are the most common and most
aggressive brain tumors due to their highly invasive
growth pattern, proliferative capacities and heterogeneity
[1]. Despite, multimodal aggressive therapy with
chemotherapy, radiation, and surgery, less than 10%
of patients with the diagnosis glioblastoma multiforme
(GBM) survive 5 years beyond diagnosis [2, 3]. For the
development of new therapeutic strategies it is unavoidable

for cell adhesion molecules of the immunoglobulin
superfamily [6]. The growth arrest–specific gene 6 (Gas6)
is the natural ligand of RTK-AXL. RTK-AXL/Gas6
signaling is in charge of regulating survival, proliferation,
and migration in different types of cells in vitro, including
tumor-derived epithelial, mesenchymal, and hematopoietic
cell lines [6–8]. RTK-AXL/Gas6 overexpression has been
described in a multitude of human cancers, including
GBM, colon, breast, prostate, thyroid, lung cancer, and
malignant melanoma [6, 7, 9]. It has been shown that
overexpression of RTK-AXL and Gas6 in GBM tissue is
associated with reduced time to progression and overall
survival in these patients [10, 11]. Its oncogenic effect is
explained by Gas6-dependent signaling through RTKAXL resulting in phosphorylation of AKT and ERK 1/2
[12]. Furthermore, anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family members
(e.g., Bcl-2) are unregulated while pro-apoptotic family
members (e.g., BAD) are inactivated [7, 13, 14].
Its exceptional role in GBM was presented in
previous studies showing that experimental inhibition of
the RTK-AXL pathway with dominant negative-mutant
glioma cells of AXL receptor (SF126 AXL-DN) suppresses
glioma growth and prolongs survival in orthotopic tumor
model in mice [15]. SF126 AXL-DN cells display an
attenuated locomotor or migration activity with reduced
formation of filopodia and loss of cell-to-cell interaction.
Tumor cell motility is impaired in SF126 AXL-DN cells,
which indicates that these cells are unable to invade normal
brain tissue. Previous results point to the fact that specific
targeting of RTK-AXL supposes a promising approach to
intervene GBM progression [16, 17].
Therefore, we studied a targeted inhibition of RTKAXL phosphorylation with selective small molecule
inhibitor BMS-777607 in vitro, ex vivo, and in vivo. We
observed significant regression of intracranial tumors
due to treatment with BMS-777607. These effects
were mediated through increased apoptosis, reduced
proliferation, migration, and neoangiogenesis. According
to the experimental results, we are the first to prove, that
RTK-AXL is phosphorylated in human GBM tissue and
that it is expressed in proliferating cells, in the migratory
front of tumor cells, and in vascular proliferates.
Additionally, we demonstrate that RTK-AXL is strongly
phosphorylated in both primary and recurrent GBMs.

U118MG compared to SF126 (Figure 1C, left image). We
examined the phosphorylation of RTK-AXL under serum
starved and standard conditions. We detected an increase
of P-AXL in cells cultured under starving conditions
(DMEM without FCS) compared to individual cell line
cultured with DMEM containing 10% FCS (Figure 1C,
right image).
The IC50 value of BMS-777607 was determined
for U118MG and SF126 at 4 and 12 hours after
single treatment (Figure 1D). Specific inhibition of
phosphorylation of RTK-AXL by BMS-777607 was
confirmed in western blot analysis. Following 12 hours
of incubation, P-AXL was significantly reduced in both
cell lines. At the same time phosphorylation of RTK-MET
was unaffected confirming the selectivity of BMS-777607
against RTK-AXL at a dosage of 12.5 µM (Figure 2A).
We therefore addressed further results as RTK-AXL
dependent. Cell staining with anti-phospho-AXL antibody
revealed membrane bound staining in both cell lines, which
was reduced following incubation with the small molecule
inhibitor of RTK-AXL BMS-777607 (Figure 2B, 2C).

BMS-777607 decreases glioma cell viability and
induces glioma cell apoptosis in vitro
The exposure of U118MG and SF126 glioma cells
with 12.5 µM BMS-777607 resulted in significantly
reduced cell numbers in MTT assay after 24 hours of
treatment (Figure 2D, left image). Single application
of 12.5 µM BMS-777607 led to a significant increase of
CPP32 activity in U118MG and SF126 cell lines after
24 hours (Figure 2D, middle image). We concluded that
reduced cell viability by BMS-777607 resulted from the
induction of apoptosis and reduction of proliferation.

BMS-777607 blocks glioma cell migration and
invasive growth pattern
Next, we addressed the effects of BMS-777607 on
glioma cell migration and invasion. Blockage of RTKAXL signaling with initial dose of 12.5 µM BMS-777607
resulted in a significant decrease of migration rate in
U118MG and SF126 cells measured by Boyden Chamber
Migration assay after 3 hours (Figure 2D, left image).
Invasive growth pattern of glioma cells was studied in the
orthotropic brain slice culture model, a three-dimensional
invasion assay closely related to an in vivo situation
as the structure and organization of the brain tissue are
preserved [19]. Under control conditions, only U118MG
cells, but not SF126 cells, demonstrated invasive growth
in this assay. Inhibition of RTK-AXL signaling with daily
administration of 12.5 µM BMS-777607 abrogated tumor
cell invasion into the brain tissue (Figure 3A, right image).
Quantitative analysis using confocal microscopy confirmed
this significant anti-invasive effect of BMS-777607 in this
ex vivo model on day 8 (Figure 3A, left image).

in vitro and in vivo
The expression of RTK-AXL in U118MG and
SF126 cells in vitro and in vivo was confirmed by
immunofluorescence staining of adherent cells (Figure 1A)
and intracranial tumor tissue (Figure 1B). Western blot

Here, 30 mg/kg BW BMS-777607 resulted in more than 90%

30 mg/ kg BW and 100 mg/kg BW (Figure 4C, right image).

DISCUSSION

BMS-777607 exerts multiple anti-tumor effects
in vivo

The principle findings of our study are that a
therapeutic inhibition of RTK-AXL results in a decreased
migration and invasion and increase of apoptotic events in
glioma cells in vitro and in vivo. The targeted inhibition
of RTK-AXL phosphorylation leads to a significant
decrease in tumor volume or even a complete regression
of tumor mass in case of SF126 and U118MG xenografts.
As previously shown by our group, antitumor effect of
RTK-AXL inhibition is related to pro-apoptotic, antiproliferative and anti-invasive effects in the tumor [15].
Our data confirm the role of RTK-AXL as mediator of
resistance to apoptosis via caspase 3 signaling [6, 7]. The
up-regulation of P-AXL under starving condition explains
the idea of an anti-apoptotic feedback loop mechanism.
Another finding of this study is that we detect an effect
of RTK-AXL inhibition toward endothelial cells resulting
in an increased ability of tube formation in vitro and less
neovascularization in vivo. We therefore conclude that
inhibition of RTK-AXL leads to an anti-angiogenic effect
and therefore represents another possible point of action
in glioma therapy.
The clinical relevance of RTK-AXL has been
illuminated by Hutterer et al. [10]. He presented clinical
data showing, that RTK-AXL is mainly expressed
in pseudo-palisades and GFAP positive tumor cells,
whereas the specific ligand of RTK-AXL Gas6 is
expressed in hypoxic border zone but not in pseudopalisades [10]. Our data localizes for the first time areas
of phosphorylated RTK-AXL in human GBM tissue.
RTK-AXL is phosphorylated in different sides of GBM
tissue especially in characteristic lesions of this disease
like hypercellular zones, pseudo-palisades, and vascular
proliferates. Activation mechanisms of RTK-AXL were
not investigated in this study, but further research has to
focus on the role of RTK-AXL-specific ligand Gas6 in
GBM. Besides activation of RTK-AXL via Gas6 other
mechanisms have to be considered like phosphorylation
by ROS (reactive oxygen species) and EGFR (epidermal
growth factor receptor) interaction [6, 20, 21]. It has been
shown that resistance to EGFR monoclonal antibodies is
leading to an up-regulation of AXL [22]. The underlying
resistance mechanism is associated with morphological
changes from epithelial to mesenchymal phenotype (EMT)
in the tumor tissue. It has been shown repeatedly that AXL
is up-regulated by EMT [23]. For this reason it would be
particularly interesting to study a combination therapy
with EGFR and RTK-AXL inhibitors to exhibit synergistic
effect with respect to tumor control and treatment response.
Due to complexity and heterogeneity of GBMs it
is unlikely that single molecular therapy would achieve
substantial anti-tumoral effect in GBM patients. But
compared to other targets, inhibition of RTK-AXL leads
to multiple anti-cancer effects blocking proliferation,
invasion, and angiogenesis. This approach displays a clear
advantage of the target RTK-AXL in glioma therapy.

The treatment with BMS-777607 revealed multiple
anti-tumor effects in vivo. In accordance with our in vitro
data, BMS-777607 treatment resulted in a reduction of
tumor cell proliferation and increase of apoptotic events in
SF126 tumor xenografts compared to the control (p = 0.012,
Figure 5A and Figure 5C, left image). Qualitative analysis
of Ki67 expression within the tumor tissue showed a
decreased proliferative activity under treatment with BMS777607 (Figure 5B).
Having shown that inhibition of RTK-AXL
phosphorylation in endothelial cells also resulted in an
impaired tube formation, we also investigated the effect of
BMS-777607 treatment on the glioma blood vessel surface
and vascular architecture using immunohistochemistry.
BMS-777607 reduced glioma vessel surface and vascular
size, revealing its anti-angiogenic efficacy (Figure 5B and
Figure 5C, right image). These findings were consistent in
the border zone and center of the tumor where different
angiogenic activities are usually observed (data not shown).

Phosphorylated RTK-AXL is abundantly present
in both primary and recurrent human GBM
specimens
The presented data suggests that therapeutic
interference with RTK-AXL phosphorylation using the
selective small molecule inhibitor BMS-777607 is an
effective means to interfere with multiple aspects of
glioma growth. Although previous reports have shown
that RTK-AXL is expressed in GBM tissue (10), it
remains unknown whether the RTK-AXL signaling
pathway is activated in humans. We therefore established
a Western Blot analysis, immunoprecipitation, and
immunohistochemical staining for P-AXL for human
GBM tissue and used normal brain tissue derived from
epilepsy surgery as negative control. We analyzed 16
GBM samples of patients in the age of 44–77 years
(mean age at diagnosis: 63 years). 8 of them had newly
diagnosed GBM, 8 had first recurrence of their GBM
following surgery and standard radio-/chemotherapy,
and underwent reoperation. For the first time, these
analyses demonstrated that RTK-AXL is abundantly
activated in GBM tissue. Western Blot analysis showed
strong protein expression as well as phosphorylation
of RTK-AXL in both primary and recurrent GBMs
with a trend for even higher RTK-AXL expression in
recurrent tumors (Figure 6A, upper and lower image).
Immunohistochemistry localized P-AXL in tumor cells
in hypercellular regions (Figure 6B, upper left image)
as well as in glioma blood vessels of primary GBM
(Figure 6B, lower left image). Interestingly RTK-AXL
was strongest phosphorylated in tumor cells surrounding
necrotic zones, so called pseudo-palisades (Figure 6B,
upper right image).

Despite the promising results with BMS-777607
treatment in a glioma model we have to state, that in very
few cases RTK inhibitors made it to clinical use in GBM
treatment and most multi-kinase inhibitors did not fulfill
expectations in clinical practice [17, 24]. One point of
failure of tyrosine kinase inhibitors in clinical practice
is toxicity. In case of sunitinib, clinical trials revealed
minimal anti-GBM activity and substantial toxicity [25].

In contrast to this multi-kinase inhibitor, BMS-777607
displays no toxicity defined by weight loss and morbidity
at a concentration of 30–50 mg/kg BW in animal models
[18, 26]. Detailed information concerning the safety
profile and maximum tolerated dose is expected by results
of a phase I multiple ascending dose study of BMS777607 (ClinicalTrials.gov, Identifier: NCT01721148) in
December 2016.

Despite toxicity, clinical failure of tyrosine kinase
inhibitors in glioma therapy is further associated with
kinase switch, mal penetrance of blood brain barrier (BBB)
and poor penetrance of tumor tissue. Selectivity of BMS777607 towards Met kinase superfamily (Ron, AXL, Tyro3, and Mer) has been shown previously [18]. Our results
demonstrate that BMS-777607 is inhibiting RTK-AXL at
the administered dosage of 12.5 µM in vitro and 30 mg/kg
BW in vivo without affecting MET kinase phosphorylation.
For that reason, we confirm crossing of the BBB and tissue
penetrance with the proof of targeted inhibition of RTKAXL phosphorylation in our xenografts. Furthermore we
address effects of BMS-777607 as AXL specific in this
study. So far we did not observe kinase switch toward
MET kinase activation. Nevertheless even if BMS-777607
might develop anti-MET kinase activity in clinical use,
this could lead to a more pronounced antitumor effect
knowing of the relevance of Met kinase superfamily in
gliomagenesis and glioma progression [27– 31]. Yet,
research has to focus on resistance mechanisms and
suitable drug combinations to overcome escape strategies
of these tumors [11, 16]. Further studies are needed to
evaluate RTK-AXL inhibition on patient derived glioma
xenografts as basis for application in clinical trials.

was comprised of Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium
(DMEM, Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal calf
serum (FCS) and 1% antibiotics (penicillin/steptamycin).
Prior starting experiments, each cell population was
grown in equal (80%) confluence in culture dishes under
normal conditions or starving conditions (culture medium
containing 0% FCS). Cell count and cell vitality was
assessed with CASY® Cell Counter TT (OLS).
HUVEC cell line was obtained from PromoCell.
Cells were cultured accordingly to manufactures
instructions.

Spheroids
Cells were relabeled prior forming spheroids with
DiI (invitrogen) according to manufactures instructions.
Cells were seeded in an uncoated, non-adhesive 96-well
plate (Sarstedt). Culture medium contained 20% Methocell
medium consisting of 6 gr. carboxymethylcellulose (Sigma
Aldrich) and 250 ml of the preheated ECBM (Endothial
cell growth medium, Lonza). 5.000 cells were plated per
well in 100 µl Methocell medium. Spheroids grew within
48 hours. Round-shaped spheroids were selected for
experiments with a diameter size of 300–500 µm.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Compound
Small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor BMS777607 was purchased by ShangHai Biochempartner Co.,
Limited (Cas No.:1196681-44-3) with a purity > 98%,
which passed an independent quality control check
by LC/MS and NMR analysis at the Lead Discovery
Center GmbH, Dortmund Germany. BMS-777607 (MW:
512.90 g/mol) was recently published as a MET kinase
inhibitor (IC50 = 3.9 nM), but has been shown to be more
selective for AXL (IC50 = 1.1 nM) [18]. IC50 value of
BMS-777607 was determined in MTT assay for each cell
assessing at least 8 different concentrations. According
to the results, the in vitro assay concentration of BMS777607 was 12.5 µM. The compound was diluted in
DMSO (Roth) and DMEM (Gibco). The control group
was treated with equal amounts of solvent.
In vivo compound was used at a concentration of
30–100 mg/kg of body weight (BW). The compound
was diluted in DMSO and PEG300 (Sigma Aldrich).
The compound was administered twice a day via
intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection. The control group received
injections containing the solvent agents.

Cell viability assay- MTT assay
5.000 cells were seeded per well of a 96-well
plate in triplicates and incubated with 0.1 ml DMEM
supplemented with 5% FCS. Fractions were treated
with DMSO or treated with compound at different
concentrations (1.56 µM–50 µM). Culture medium was
replaced or exchanged after 24, 48 and 72 hours. 100 µl
of MTT reagent (Thiazolyl Blue Tetrazolium Bromide,
Sigma) was added and incubated for 3 hour. Crystals were
solved with 100 µl DMSO-isopropanol (Sigma Aldrich)
(1:1) under constant shacking for 10 minutes. Absorption
of supernatant was measured at 570 nm with plate reader
(infinite200).

Apoptosis assay
Apoptosis was measured with caspase3/CPP32
Colorimetric Assay Kit (Biovision). Cells were cultured
for 24 hours with 50 ng/ml TNF-alpha (Dianova) or
with compound at a concentration of 12.5 µM. The noninduced control was treated with solvent DMSO at a final
concentration of 0.5% (Sigma Aldrich). 200 µg protein
were incubated with 2 × Reaction buffer containing 10 mM
DTT and DEVD-pNA substrate. Absorption was determined

Cell culture
Human high-grade glioma cells U118MG were
obtained from American Type Culture Collection
(ATCC). Human high-grade glioma cells SF126 were
obtained from the JCRB Cell Bank. Both were primary

at 405 nm. Fold increase in CPP32 activity was determined
by comparing results of treated group with the level of the
non-induced control. Assay was performed in triplicates
for the calculation of mean values and standard deviation
(n =  3).

Angiogenesis, ibiTreat), matigel solution formed gel
within 30 minutes incubation time at 37°C. Harvested
HUVEC cells were suspended in a concentration of
200 000 cells/ml with 12.5 µM concentration of compound
or vehicle (0.5% DMSO). 50 µl of cell suspension pro
well was added onto solidified gel and incubated for 4 to
20 hours. Tube formation was analyzed with Zeiss
Axiovision fluorescence microscope. Tube length and
branching points were quantified using online service
Wimasis Image Analysis (n = 5).

Boyden chamber migration assay
Experiments were performed with 50.000 cells
per chamber. Prior starting the experiment the inserts
were coated with fibronectin (Sigma Aldrich) at a final
concentration of 10 µg/ml in cold PBS. Inserts were
incubated with fibronectin for 2 hours in the cell incubator.
Cell suspension and compound were added to the upper
chamber (compound concentration: 12.5 µM). The lower
chamber was filled with 110 µl of fibroblast-conditioned
medium (FCM) to stimulate cell migration. A filter with
8 µm pore size separated the upper and lower chamber.
After a migration time of 3 hours, cells adhering to the
bottom side of the filters were fixed with methanol for 5
minutes. The inserts were dried for 5 minutes and then
stained with DAPI (Sigma Aldrich, diluted in PBS 1:100).
Cells per field were counted at a magnification of 10 fold,
4 fields per filter were averaged (n = 5).

Experimental tumor models
Athymic CD-1 Nu/Nu nude mice (female,
obtained from Charles River) were maintained within
a pathogen germ-free environment and were used at
6–10 weeks of age. The weight ranges was in a range
of 20 to 28 gram. Experiments were performed in
accordance with the approved institutional protocol and
the guidelines of the Institutional Animal Care and Use
Committee. General anesthesia was induced with 7%
Ketaminhydrochlorid (Ketavet, Pfizer), 8% Xylaxine
(Rompun 2%, Bayer) dissolved in aqua via i.p. injection.
Phenoxymethylpenicillin (InfectoCilin, 5 Mega) was
administered via intramuscular injection. For stereotactic
tumor cell implantation, mice were positioned in the
stereotactic platform. A longitudinal skin incision was
performed in the mid scalp extending from the ears
caudally. The burr hole was drilled with a syringe of 23′G
2 mm posterior and 1.5 mm laterally to bregma. Hamilton
syringe was loaded with glioma cells dissolved in DMEM
without FCS. Hamilton syringe was inserted gently to a
depth of 4 mm. After injection wound was closed with
suture (Prolene 2.0, Ethicon). Finally, mice were placed on
a heating plate set to 37°C until regaining consciousness.
Drinking water was enriched with tramadol calculating
15 mg/kg BW (Grünenthal). Contrast enhanced MRI
(gadopentetate dimeglumine; Magnesvist, Bayer) scans
were performed under anesthesia with 7T Bruker MRI
(PharmaScan 70/16 US, Bruker Software Paravision 5.1).
Tumor volumetric analysis was carried out with Analyze
10.0 and ImageJ software. Mice were sacrificed at day 14
and the body was perfused with PBS under anesthesia.
The whole brain or tumor was dissected and immediately
frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80°C (n = 7).

Orthotopic brain slice invasion assay
For preparation of brain slice cultures, 3 to 6-daysold mouse pups (C57BL/6NCrl, Charles River) were
used. Brain hemispheres were sectioned in 300 µm thick
coronary slices (McIllwain tissue chopper). Slices were
separated in ice cold dissection medium containing 99 ml
MEM and 1 ml glutamine (Gibco) and cultured onto
semipermeable membrane of inserts (Transparent PET
membrane, 1.6 × 106-pores/cm², BD, Falcon®) with 1 ml
culture medium containing 23 ml MEM (Gibco21575),
12.5 ml Horse serum, 12.5 ml BME (Gibco 41010), 1.5 ml
of 20% glucose (Roth) and 0.5 ml Glutamine (Life
Technologies, L-Glutamine 200 mM). Medium was
replaced every two days. 24 hours after cultivation prelabeled spheroids were placed in the area between striatum
and corpus callosum. Invasion of DiI-labeled cells were
monitored using confocal microscopy. After 8 days
slices were fixed in 4% PFA for 2 hours at 37°C. Nuclear
staining of slices was performed with To-PRO-3 according
to manufacturer’s instructions (Life Technologies). Slices
were transferred onto glass slides (Langenbrinck) and
mounted in mounting medium (Immuno mount, Thermo
Scientific) for confocal analysis. Confocal analysis
was performed with Zeiss Confocal microscope. For
quantitative analysis distance of invaded cells from border
of spheroid was measured (n = 8).

Immunoprecipitation (IP)
IP was performed using Protein A- Sepherose 4A
beads (Life Technologies). Low salt IP- lysis buffer
was enriched with Halt™ Phosphatase Inhibitor SingleUse Cocktail (Thermo Scientific) and Halt Protease
Inhibitor Single-Use Cocktail (Thermo Scientific).
Immuncomplexes were prepared with 200 µg protein and
1:50 dilution of anti-AXL (C89E7) rabbit antibody (Cell
Signaling). Assay was performed according to previous
protocol (14). Detection of RTK-AXL phosphorylation

was determined using antibody 4G10 mouse antityrosine antibody (Max Planck Institute of Biochemistry,
Dilution 1:2.000).

Sections were fixed with PFA 4%. Staining of intratumoral
vessels and proliferation was carried out with purified
rat anti-mouse CD31 antibody (clone MEC13.3, BD
Pharmingen™) and rabbit anti-Ki-67 antigen monoclonal
antibody (clone SP6, Diganostic BioSystems). The
following secondary, fluorescently labeled antibodies
were used: FITC-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG
(Dianova, 711-095-152), Cy3-conjugated donkey anti-rat
IgG (Dianova, 712-165-153). Apoptotic activity within
the tumor was assessed using Apoptaq kit (Millipore).
Staining procedure was done according to manufacturer´s
instructions.
Tissue staining for AXL and phospho-AXL was
carried out on PFA fixed slices. Cells and brain slices were
finally counterstained with DAPI (Thermo Scientific). Slices
were analyzed using a fluorescence microscope (Zeiss).
For statistical analysis we used ImageJ software. For
qualitative analysis of fluorescent signal, all parameters
were maintained as set for the initial image.

Western blotting (WB)
Protein samples were boiled for 5 min with
Laemmli sample buffer (Bio-Rad Laboratories) and
loaded into pre-poured Tris-HCl-glycine SDS-PAGE gels
(stacking gel 4%, resolving gel 6% or 8%). Gels run at
150 V for 1.5 hours following transfer to a polyvinylidene
difluoride membrane (PVDF, Bio-Rad Laboratories) at
40 mA constant current for 2 h. Blots were blocked with
5% BSA in 1xTBST, primary and secondary antibodies
were dissolved in TBST. Following primary antibodies
were used. R & D Systems: human phopho-AXL (Y779)
mAb (Clone 713610), Cell Signaling: anti-AXL C89E7
rabbit mAb, phospho-MET (Tyr1234/1235) rabbit
mAb (D26) XP®. Santa Cruz: Gas6 antibody (C-20).
Sigma Aldrich: mouse monoclonal β-actin antibody
(clone 1A4). Immunocomplexes were visualized using
a second HRP-conjugated anti-rabbit or anti-mouse
antibody (Pierce Biotechnology). For development
we used ECL Kit (Sigma). ImageJ Software was used
for densitometry analysis. Reported values were first
normalized to the loading control and then multiplied
by a constant to reach the lowest whole integral. Each
western blot was carried out with a negative control
consistent of sample diluent or beads incubated with
antibody and sample diluent only.

Human tissue
Immunohistochemical staining of formalin-fixed,
paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue sections (4 μm-thick)
was performed on a VENTANA Benchmark XT automated
staining instrument according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. Slides were de-paraffinized using EZ prep
solution (Ventana Medical Systems, Tucson, AZ) for
30 minutes at 75°C. Antigen retrieval was accomplished
on the automated stainer using CC1 solution (Ventana
Medical Systems, Tucson, AZ) for 60 minutes at 95°C.
Briefly, the anti-phospho-AXL antibody (Human PhosphoAXL (Y779) monoclonal mouse IgG Clone 713610, R & D
Systems, dilution 1:50) was applied and developed
using the iVIEW DAB Detection Kit (Ventana Medical
Systems). All slides were then counterstained with
hematoxylin for 4 minutes.

Immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence
cells
Adherent cells were plated onto cover slips and
fixed with 4% PFA for 10 minutes at room temperature.
Cells were blocked with 1% casein for 45 minutes at room
temperature. Antibodies were diluted in 0.5% casein. The
primary antibody was incubated for one to two hours,
the secondary antibody for one hour. Wash steps were
carried out with TBST. Negative control was carried out
without primary antibody incubation and is shown in
Supplementary Figure S1 for anti-AXL antibody and antiphospho-AXL antibody.
For immunofluorescence human phopho-AXL
(Y779) mAb (Clone 713610, R & D Systems) and antiAXL C89E7 rabbit mAb (Cell Signaling) were used. The
following secondary, fluorescently labeled antibodies were
used: FITC-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG (Dianova,
711-095-152), Cy3-conjugated donkey anti-mouse IgG
(Dianova, 115-165-146).

Patient data
Clinical data was assessed under an institutional
review board-approved protocol and de-identified for
patient confidentiality. We included 16 GBM patients,
which have been treated in our institution in the year
2015. GBM diagnosis was assured of two independent
neuropathologists. RTK-AXL and phospho-AXL
expression was quantified with IP and WB analysis
in 8 patients with primary GBM and in 8 patients with
recurrent disease, which received re-resection. FFPE
tissue sections of these individual 16 patients were stained
with anti-phospho-AXL antibody.
