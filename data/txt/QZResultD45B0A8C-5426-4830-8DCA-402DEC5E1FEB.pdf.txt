BACKGROUND: Given the expanding use of oral chemotherapies, the authors set out to examine errors in the prescribing, dispensing, administration, and monitoring of these drugs. METHODS: Reports were collected of oral chemotherapy-associated medication errors from a medical literature and Internet search and review of reports to the
Medication Errors Reporting Program and MEDMARX. The authors solicited incident reports from 14 comprehensive
cancer centers, and also collected incident reports, pharmacy interventions, and prompted clinician reports from their
own center. They classified the type of incident, severity, stage in the medication use process, and type of medication
error. They examined the yield of the various reporting methods to identify oral chemotherapy-related medication
errors. RESULTS: The authors identified 99 adverse drug events, 322 near misses, and 87 medical errors with low risk
of harm. Of the 99 adverse drug events, 20 were serious or life-threatening, 52 were significant, and 25 were minor.
The most common medication errors involved wrong dose (38.8%), wrong drug (13.6%), wrong number of days supplied (11.0%), and missed dose (10.0%). The majority of errors resulted in a near miss; however, 39.3% of reports
involving the wrong number of days supplied resulted in adverse drug events. Incidents derived from the literature
search and hospital incident reporting system included a larger percentage of adverse drug events (73.1% and 58.8%,
respectively) compared with other sources. CONCLUSIONS: Ensuring oral chemotherapy safety requires improvements in the way these drugs are ordered, dispensed, administered, and monitored. Cancer 2010;116:2455–64.

KEYWORDS: oral chemotherapy, incident reports, medication errors, adverse drug events.

With over 25 million doses administered annually, oral chemotherapy is an expanding and potentially hazardous treatment for cancer patients.1 Taken as monotherapy or in combination with other antineoplastic agents, oral chemotherapy
enjoys few of the safeguards that have evolved for the prescribing, dispensing, and administration of traditional intravenous chemotherapies. In a 2006 survey of US cancer centers, we found that only 1 in 4 centers had standard prescribing
safeguards in place for oral chemotherapies, and fewer than 1 in 5 had measures to ensure safe administration and monitoring.2 A National Comprehensive Cancer Network task force concluded that ‘‘adequate safety and support systems have
not evolved as quickly as oral chemotherapy agents.’’1
To characterize the risks associated with prescribing, dispensing, administering, and monitoring oral chemotherapy,
we collected information from disparate sources. We defined an error, following the World Health Organization, as ‘‘the
failure of a planned action to be completed as intended’’ or ‘‘the use of a wrong plan to achieve an aim.’’3 The main goal of
the study was to characterize the types of errors and preventable injuries that result from oral chemotherapy. The secondary goal was to examine the utility of various incident reporting methods for identifying errors and injuries of various
types. We hypothesized that medication errors would occur at every stage of the oral chemotherapy medication use process, but that administration and monitoring would be particularly vulnerable steps.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Incident Identification
We used a multifaceted approach to identify incident
reports involving oral chemotherapies (Table 1). First, we
searched the medical literature via PubMed using the
Medical Subject Heading (MeSH) terms ‘‘patient compliance,’’ ‘‘administration, oral,’’ ‘‘antineoplastic agents,’’
‘‘risk management,’’ ‘‘medical errors,’’ and ‘‘medication
error.’’ We combined the MeSH term ‘‘medication error’’
with the generic and brand names of 4 widely used cytotoxic oral chemotherapies that were of special interest to
the research team: capecitabine, imatinib, mercaptopurine, and temozolomide. We reviewed abstracts and full
text articles, hand searching bibliographies for relevant
references, and examined related citations identified
through PubMed. This strategy yielded 74 articles without distinct errors or incidents.
Second, we used Google and LexisNexis, searching
for the terms ‘‘error,’’ ‘‘overdose,’’ ‘‘underdose,’’ ‘‘inappropriate,’’ ‘‘wrong,’’ ‘‘mistake,’’ ‘‘misuse,’’ ‘‘accident,’’ and
‘‘tragedy’’ in conjunction with generic and brand names
of ‘‘capecitabine,’’ ‘‘imatinib,’’ ‘‘mercaptopurine,’’ ‘‘6
MP,’’ or ‘‘temozolomide.’’ We also searched the Web sites
of 7 patient safety-oriented organizations, including the
US Veterans Administration’s National Center for
Patient Safety, the Pennsylvania Patient Safety Authority,
the Joint Commission, the US Food and Drug Administration, Drug Topics (a pharmacy trade publication), the
Institute for Safe Medication Practices, and United States
Pharmacopeia (USP). These strategies yielded 43 reports,
which, after excluding duplicates and nonoral chemotherapies, yielded 28 incidents.
Third, we contracted with USP to search its files for
incidents involving oral chemotherapies. USP collects
medication error reports from 2 reporting programs: the
Medication Errors Reporting Program and MEDMARX.
The Medication Errors Reporting Program is a program
for healthcare professionals and consumers to report medication errors. MEDMARX is a subscription-based program for hospitals and healthcare systems to report
medication errors and adverse drug reactions. To manage
the scope of the search, we limited the investigation to
incidents reported from November 1999 to November
2007 involving the 4 target medications (capecitabine,
temozolomide, mercaptopurine, and imatinib). This
strategy yielded 413 incidents.
Fourth, we solicited incident reports and root
cause analyses from the 14 members of the Comprehen-

2456

sive Cancer Center Consortium for Quality Improvement. The quality directors of these academic centers
collaborate on quality improvement and research initiatives. We invited organizations to submit deidentified
(by patient, provider, and organization) reports and
root cause analyses at the group’s biannual meeting and
via the group’s listserv. Seven centers elected to participate and submitted 45 incidents and 1 root cause
analysis.
Fifth, we obtained approval from the Dana-Farber
Harvard Cancer Center Institutional Review Board to
review incident reports and pharmacy intervention reports
from Dana-Farber Cancer Institute from January 2004
through June 2008. The incident reporting system is
managed by the Department of Quality Improvement
and Risk Management (QI/RM). Paper forms were submitted through April 2006, when an electronic system
was implemented. Pharmacy interventions are reported in
a separate electronic system used to record events requiring a pharmacist to contact other clinicians to clarify medication orders. To ensure subject confidentiality, non–
study team members of the pharmacy and QI/RM staff
screened all 2332 incident reports and prepared 20 deidentified reports for investigators to review. They also
screened 2375 intervention reports and identified 177 for
investigators to review.
Finally, we elicited errors related to oral chemotherapy by prompting clinical oncologists and nurse practitioners to submit voluntary reports using methods
described previously in inpatient settings.4,5 Eighteen
clinicians (14 physicians and 4 nurse practitioners) from
the investigators’ cancer center were recruited at department meetings and by E-mail invitation. The participants
provided written informed consent, agreeing to receive
weekly E-mail reminders prompting them to submit oral
chemotherapy-related incident reports for 12 weeks. We
provided a link to the hospital’s electronic incident reporting system and also permitted reporting via E-mail or
voicemail. To ensure respondents’ confidentiality, a
member of the Department of QI/RM who was not a
member of the study team collected reports and deidentified the patient, treating clinician, and reporter. Clinicians
received a total of 216 reminders and submitted 17
reports.
Incident Classification
We entered all incidents into an electronic database for
analysis and classified reports using an approach developed by Bates and colleagues in studies of adverse drug

events in outpatient and hospital settings.6-8 A physician
patient safety researcher (S.N.W.) and an oncology nurse
(J.T.) classified each incident as an adverse drug event (an
injury because of a medication), near miss (error with
potential for injury that may or may not have reached the
patient), or medical error with low risk of harm (a mistake
in the medication use process but with minimal potential
for injury). Adverse drug events were further classified by
preventability on a 4-point Likert scale, and by severity.
Serious or life-threatening events resulted or could have
resulted in hospital-level care or harm equivalent to level 4
toxicity, as defined by the National Cancer Institute’s
Common Toxicity Criteria. Significant events caused
pain, nausea, malaise, or other symptoms equivalent to a
grade 3 Common Toxicity Criteria score. Minor injuries
produced slight laboratory test abnormalities, transient
symptoms such as pain at a phlebotomy site, or Common
Toxicity Criteria scores of 2.
Reviewers identified the individuals who were most
closely associated with each incident, the actual injury (if
any) to the patient, the stage in the medication process
where the error occurred, and the type of complication.
They also assessed whether the incident was intercepted
before it reached the patient and, if so, identified the individual who intercepted it. Reviewers sought to classify the
location of care (inpatient vs outpatient) as well as drugs
that were given as part of a research protocol, but this information was not available often enough to allow for reliable
classification. Finally, reviewers identified the principal
type of medication error that resulted in the incident, such
as wrong patient, drug, or dose; problems with patient
monitoring and adherence; and wrong number of pills dispensed.9 Given the abbreviated nature of most reports, information about the root cause of most incidents was
unavailable.
Reviewers practiced sample cases and discussed their
classifications to clarify assumptions and definitions.
They coded 24 incidents independently, reconciling discrepant codes by discussion. With the exception of
‘‘involved parties’’ (kappa, 0.30; P ¼ .006; 80% agreement), the kappa statistic showed good to excellent interrater reliability for each classification category, with kappa
scores between 0.64 and 1.00 (P < .001 for all) and 80%
to 100% agreement. Kappa could not be estimated for
preventability because of high levels of consensus; all incidents were judged possibly or probably preventable.
Assured of a high level of inter-rater reliability, the
reviewers divided the remaining incidents, and a single
reviewer coded each.

2458

We identified 701 oral chemotherapy-related incidents from all sources (Table 1). We excluded 193
(27.5%) of the 701 events for the following reasons: the
report did not include sufficient information to classify
the event (n ¼ 58); the incident involved clarification or
justification of a clinician’s order (n ¼ 32), violation of a
hospital policy (eg, family administers dose while waiting)
or problems with service quality (eg, waits and delays)
(n ¼ 91), or problems with protocol registration rather
than clinical care (n ¼ 4); or the incident did not involve
oral chemotherapy (n ¼ 8). Exclusion rates varied by
source, from 7.1% of reports identified by literature
search to 52.9% of elicited clinician reports. The final
sample comprised 508 incidents.
Data Analyses
We tabulated the number and percent of oral chemotherapy incident reports by type of incident, severity, injury,
type of complication, principal party involved, stage in
medication use process, interception status, drug name,
and type of error. We analyzed the distribution of errors
by incident type and stage and examined verbatim incident reports to characterize these events thematically.
Finally, we examined the yield of various methods for
identifying oral chemotherapy-related medication errors.
Analyses were conducted using Stata 9.0 (StataCorp, College Station, Tex).

RESULTS
Incidents
We identified 508 classifiable incidents involving 73 different medications (including investigational agents): 99
(19.5%) adverse drug events, 322 (63.4%) near misses,
and 87 (17.1%) medical errors with low risk of harm
(Table 2). Of the 99 adverse drug events, we classified 20
as serious or life-threatening events, 52 as significant
events, and 25 as events with minor injury. Among the
322 near misses, 2 posed a risk of serious or life-threatening injury, 187 of significant injury, and 132 of minor
injury. We were unable to classify with certainty the severity of 2 adverse drug events and 1 near miss report. The
most commonly identified medications included capecitabine (n ¼ 111), imatinib (n ¼ 55), temozolomide (n ¼
53), methotrexate (n ¼ 16), hydroxyurea (n ¼ 8), and
vinorelbine (n ¼ 8).
The reports included 12 deaths, 1 disability, 21 cases
of extended symptoms or hospitalization, and 5 cases of
symptoms lasting <1 day (Table 2). Most of the reports

Medication Errors
We identified a variety of medication errors associated
with oral chemotherapies (Table 3), of which wrong dose
(38.8%), wrong drug (13.6%), wrong number of days
supplied (11.0%), and missed dose (10.0%) were the
most common. The majority of errors resulted in a near
miss; however, 39.3% of errors involving the wrong number of days supplied resulted in adverse drug events.

Wrong Dose Errors
Table 4 shows the distribution of errors by stage in the
medication use process. Wrong dose errors occurred at
several stages. Problems with physician order writing
accounted for 59.4% of these errors, as in the case of the
death of a patient on a research protocol whose physician
accidentally wrote a 10-fold overdose of temozolomide.
In another case, a covering physician misinterpreted the
daily dose of temozolomide as the dose per square meter.
This overdose resulted in bone marrow suppression
requiring blood product and factor support.
Dispensing errors accounted for 13.2% of wrong
dose errors. In 1 incident, a pharmacist misinterpreted a
prescription for mercaptopurine 50 mg twice a day as 300
mg daily, resulting in serious bleeding. Capecitabine was
particularly prone to dispensing errors, given its various
pill sizes and dosing algorithms. For example, a prescription written as 500-mg tablets, take ‘‘4 tablets twice daily
for Days 1-14’’ was dispensed as 4 150-mg tablets, take 4
twice a day. This error was discovered after the patient
completed the first cycle of treatment. In another case, an
order for 1800 mg twice a day was dispensed as 800 mg
twice a day. In a similar case, the physician gave the
patient 3 separate prescriptions for temozolomide and
instructions to take 1 100-mg capsule, 2 20-mg capsules,
and 3 5-mg capsules (for a total daily dose of 155 mg), but
the pharmacist filled only the 5-mg prescription (for a
daily dose of 15 mg).
Drug administration errors accounted for 27.4% of
dosing errors. In 1 report, a patient with limited English
proficiency failed to temporarily discontinue cyclophosphamide during radiation therapy, as directed by the

physician. Another patient with limited English proficiency failed to inform hospital staff that he had taken his
imatinib before arriving at the hospital and inadvertently
received a duplicate dose. Another patient failed to discontinue his oral cyclophosphamide (the prescriber’s
intent) when his/her intravenous chemotherapy was on
hold, because the patient had never been told to do so.
Wrong Drug Errors
Wrong drug incidents often involved problems with prescribing (20.3%) and administration (76.8%). Sound-alike
drugs led to erroneous administration of oral chemotherapy

to several patients without cancer. For example, a pregnant
woman received Matulane (procarbazine, Sigma-Tau, Gaithersburg, Md) rather than Materna (Wyeth, Madison,
NJ), a prenatal vitamin, which resulted in a miscarriage.
Another patient was prescribed Temodar (temozolomide,
Schering, Kenilworth, NJ) 100 mg daily, but received the
antitussive Tessalon (benzonatate, Forrest, New York, NY)
at the same dose. A patient who was supposed to receive
metoclopramide for nausea received mercaptopurine
instead. In several cases, patients with thyroid disease
received (and took) Purinethol (mercaptopurine, GlaxoSmithKline, Brentford, UK) rather than propylthiouracil,

and a patient with acute lymphoblastic leukemia received
propylthiouracil rather than mercaptopurine.
Wrong Number of Days Supplied
Incidents involving wrong number of days supplied may
be of particular concern in oncology compared with other
specialty areas. These errors resulted in confusion regarding the appropriate dosing schedule. For example, a
patient who was dispensed 190 mg of lomustine daily
died of complications of bone marrow suppression.
Although the prescription was written for a single dose
every 6 weeks, it was misread by the pharmacist, who dispensed a daily dose. In another lomustine case, the pharmacist dispensed a package of 20 40-mg capsules, with
instructions to take a single 160-mg dose (ie, only 4 capsules). The patient misunderstood the instructions and
took 4 capsules daily for 5 days. In other cases, the dispensing instructions were written clearly but were misinterpreted by the patient. For example, 1 patient took
10 mg of methotrexate daily rather than weekly; another
took 2.5 mg of methotrexate twice a day for 12 doses
rather than 3 doses. Both died of complications of
their therapy. Another patient misunderstood the dosing
interval of capecitabine (2 weeks on, 1 week off). He
completed a 2-week course of the medication, and then
refilled the prescription for another 2-week supply at a
different community pharmacy. The patient was hospitalized for diarrhea and dehydration, drug-related
toxicities.
Missed Dose Errors
Missed doses occurred for a variety of reasons. In the inpatient setting, transcription errors in nursing and pharmacy
involved capecitabine, imatinib, mercaptopurine, and
temozolomide. In the ambulatory setting, nonadherence
played a significant role. Patients missed doses because
they forgot, misunderstood the instructions, or experienced side effects. Many missed-dose errors affected
patients on investigational protocols; often these events
were intercepted by pharmacists who noted that the
patients’ parameters to treat (eg, blood counts, renal function, liver enzymes, lipase, or presence of proteinuria)
warranted adjustment or temporary discontinuation of a
drug. In 1 case, capecitabine was not dispensed because
the patient’s blood tests had not yet been ordered.
Other Errors
Confusing or ambiguous instructions led to errors that
resulted in discrepancies in the tablet strength, number of

Cancer

tablets taken at each administration, frequency of administration, and total daily dose. Incomplete prescriptions
failed to identify the patient, dose, route, frequency, or
stop date, and were routinely intercepted in the pharmacy.
Wrong frequency errors occurred in cases where a dose
reduction of sorafenib (from twice a day to once daily) for
previous toxicity had been overlooked, and in cases where
full-strength doses of an investigational agent (twice a
day) were intended after a previous dose reduction (daily).
Protocol breaches involved various technical errors in the
dates of treatment, coadministration of hydration and
antiemetics, dose calculations, and treatment duration for
research protocols.
Sources of Reports
Table 5 stratifies the types of incidents, stage in the medication process, and types of error by source of the incident
report. Incidents derived from the literature and Web
search and from our cancer center’s incident reporting system included a larger percentage of adverse drug events
(73.1% and 58.8%, respectively), compared with other
sources. Pharmacy interventions, USP reports, and
reports from the Comprehensive Cancer Center Consortium for Quality Improvement cancer centers included
many near-miss reports (85.8%, 61.2%, and 53.9%,
respectively).
Different sources of information identified problems at particular stages in the medication process. For
example, pharmacy interventions were enriched with
reports that addressed medication orders (90.6% of
reports). Comprehensive Cancer Center Consortium for
Quality Improvement reports, in contrast, involved ordering in 51.3% of reports, followed by administration in
33.3%. The USP reports were rich in events related to dispensing of medications (46.4% of reports). Similarly, various data sources differentially identified certain types of
medication errors. For example, wrong drug errors were
often seen in reports derived from the literature search
and USP reports. Missed dose and nonadherence errors
were concentrated in reports from USP, Comprehensive
Cancer Center Consortium for Quality Improvement
cancer centers, and prompted clinician reports. Errors in
monitoring or follow-up were identified primarily via
pharmacy interventions.

serious hazard. We analyzed over 500 reports of medication errors involving oral chemotherapies from disparate
data sources. The majority of incidents resulted in or had
the potential for significant harm, often involving bone
marrow suppression and compromised treatment efficacy.
As hypothesized, errors occurred at every stage of the medication process, although failures in ordering were most
frequent. Incorrect drug dose was the most common type
of error; however, wrong drug errors and errors in which
the wrong number of days’ supply was dispensed were the
most likely to result in adverse drug events.
Errors involving oral chemotherapy mirrored the
types of medication errors observed for nonchemotherapy
medications. For example, Bates et al found that preventable medication errors involving medical and surgical
inpatients most often occurred during ordering (49%)
and administration (26%), and were typically because of
the wrong dose or drug or, in the case of administration
errors, use of the incorrect dose or technique.7 Kaushal et
al found that 74% of medication errors among pediatric

2462

inpatients occurred during the ordering stage, and 28%
involved incorrect dosing.12 Among adult ambulatory
patients, medication errors also occurred most frequently
during the ordering phase, and were because of the selection of an inappropriate drug, dose, or frequency.8,13
Our study identified relatively few events related to
patient nonadherence and to problems with monitoring
and follow-up–areas that we had hypothesized would
pose risk based on previous studies involving women with
breast cancer and parents of pediatric leukemia
patients.14,15 Similarly, a recent investigation of 1262
adult and 117 pediatric outpatient oncology visits
revealed that the majority of medication errors occurred
in administration (56%), and 20% were associated with
medicines used in the home setting. Over half of pediatric
errors with the potential for harm were made during
home administration.16 More recently, Partridge reported
3-year nonadherence rates of 21% to 38% among women
using long-term hormonal therapies for breast cancer.17
We suspect that our data underestimate the incidence of

Cancer

these errors, because errors resulting from patient behavior (such as failure to take medications as directed) and
errors of omission in the behavior of clinicians (failure to
warn, anticipate, monitor, etc.) are difficult to detect
using incident reporting.
Our study identified several vulnerabilities that are
particularly germane to oncology care, including errors in
the number of pills supplied (given variable week on-off
dosing schedules and the need to combine different pill
strengths to yield the appropriate dose).18 Some of this
risk may be inherent in oncology care, given complex regimens, the need for frequent titration of medication dosing, and administration based on drug levels and
toxicities. However, it also points to complexity as a
potential target for improvement efforts.19,20 Opportunities to simplify and standardize oncology practice may
have much to offer, as in current efforts to standardize
chemotherapy regimens and to use templated order
forms.21 Computerized order-entry systems also show
promise, but most existing systems lack adequate functionality to support oncology care.22 Other improvements
go beyond the capacity of individual oncologists or cancer
centers to the role of pharmaceutical companies in the
intelligent design of clinical trials and the manufacture of
dose forms that allow for simple prescribing, dispensing,
and administration.
Although the main goal of this study was to characterize the types of errors that result from oral chemotherapy, we also sought to examine the utility of different
methods for identifying oral chemotherapy-related events.
We found a concentration of the most serious events on
review of Web sources. Voluntary safety incident reports
at our own cancer center were also rich in adverse drug
events, perhaps a reflection of front-line staff members’
perceived obligation to report these incidents, as well as an
environment that supports nonpunitive reporting. Pharmacy interventions, reports from sister cancer centers, and
USP reports were rich in near-miss errors, a result of the
pharmacists’ critical role in reviewing physicians’ orders,
labs, and treatment protocols before dispensing drugs.
The diverse data sources afforded different perspectives
on oral chemotherapy risks. A corollary finding of this
study is that a comprehensive understanding of the risks
related to oral chemotherapy requires the use of multiple
methods for event detection.
This study’s limitations include the use of incident
reports, which are subject to reporting bias. Underreporting is common, because clinicians may be reluctant to
report their own errors, many systems are inconvenient to

Cancer

use, and physicians rarely participate.23-26 These data
sources also over-represent the experience of patients at
large cancer centers. Compared with a community oncology population, these patients may be more health literate, economically advantaged, likely to participate in
research studies, compliant with therapy, and more vigilant regarding adverse effects. Given the telegraphic nature of many reports, we may have inadvertently
misclassified some events.27 Similarly, we lack information about the number of doses dispensed or patients at
risk; without this information, we lack denominators that
permit estimates of event rates. The strengths of the study
include the variety of sources used to identify oral chemotherapy-related incidents, as well as the range of medications and practice settings. Rather than epidemiologically
valid prevalence estimates, these reports provide a descriptive account of a range of medication errors and facilitate
the development of targeted interventions to address areas
of risk.
In sum, oral chemotherapy is an emerging area of
risk in oncology practice. The oncology community needs
to develop safer practices for ordering, dispensing, administering, and monitoring these medications.
