BACKGROUND: Simultaneous inhibition of the vascular epithelial growth factor (VEGF) and the mammalian target of
rapamycin (mTOR) pathway may improve treatment response in advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC). Everolimus,
an oral mTOR inhibitor, and sunitinib, an oral tyrosine kinase inhibitor targeting VEGF, are standard agents in the
management of metastatic RCC. METHODS: Sequential cohorts of 3 to 6 patients with advanced RCC received doseescalated combinations of sunitinib (37.5 or 50 mg daily, 4 weeks on/2 weeks off) with everolimus (2.5-5 mg daily or
20-30 mg weekly). Dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) were assessed in the first 6-week cycle to determine maximum tolerated dose (MTD). Pharmacokinetic profiles were obtained. RESULTS: Twenty patients (13 clear cell and 7 nonclear
cell RCC) were enrolled in 5 cohorts. Daily everolimus was not tolerated when combined with sunitinib; the first 2
patients on the second cohort suffered DLTs. With weekly everolimus, the MTD was 30 mg everolimus on days 7, 14,
21, and 28, plus 37.5 mg sunitinib on days 1 to 28 of a 42-day cycle; however, chronic treatment was associated with
grade 3 and 4 toxicities. A schedule of 20 mg everolimus weekly/37.5 mg sunitinib was tolerated as chronic therapy.
Five patients (25%) had confirmed partial responses, and 3 had nonclear cell RCC. No unexpected accumulation of
everolimus, sunitinib, or N-desethyl sunitinib was observed. CONCLUSIONS: The combination of everolimus and sunitinib is associated with significant acute and chronic toxicities and is only tolerated at attenuated doses. Responses

INTRODUCTION
Increased understanding of the molecular pathophysiology of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) has led to development
and approval of several targeted agents, including 3 multitarget tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) (sorafenib, sunitinib,
and pazopanib), an antivascular epithelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) monoclonal antibody (bevacizumab, given in combination with interferon), and 2 mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitors (temsirolimus and everolimus), each
shown to be superior to either immunotherapy or placebo in randomized phase 3 trials.1-6 Targeted agents have been combined in an attempt to improve efficacy and overcome drug resistance.7,8 For this, it is essential to understand the precise
interplay between VEGF, the hypoxia-inducible factor 1 alpha (HIF-1a), and the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/
Akt/mTOR pathway. Through its downstream effectors, mTOR raises levels of VEGF and HIF-1a.9 HIF-1a induces a
further increase in VEGF, which in turn activates the PI3K/Akt/mTOR axis.10 As suggested by preclinical models,11,12
inhibiting steps in this autocrine loop (mTOR–HIF–VEGF-mTOR) could prove superior to single sequential agents.13
We hypothesized that synchronous blockade of VEGF and mTOR with sunitinib and everolimus might enhance antitumor activity, especially because patients resistant to sunitinib benefit from everolimus,1 which argues against significant
cross-resistance. This study evaluated the safety and identified the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of sunitinib administered with everolimus.

hemorrhage within 4 weeks. Prior gastrointestinal perforation, intra-abdominal abscess within 6 months, or
impairment of gastrointestinal function that could limit
drug absorption were also reasons for exclusion from
enrollment. Informed consent was obtained from all
patients in this trial.
Study Design
This was a single-center, open-label, phase 1 study with a
standard 3 þ 3 dose escalation design. Cohorts of 3 to 6
patients were enrolled sequentially to receive concurrent
sunitinib and everolimus at escalating doses (Table 1).
Everolimus was administered on a continuous schedule either daily or weekly in combination with sunitinib given
daily using a standard 4 weeks on 2 weeks off (4/2) schedule to establish the MTD (ie, highest dose level at which
zero or 1 of 6 patients experienced a dose-limiting toxicity
[DLT]). The starting dose of everolimus (2.5 mg daily)

1869

Original Article

was chosen as the lowest daily dose expected to provide
adequate inhibition of mTOR.14,15 The starting dose of
sunitinib was 37.5 mg daily (4/2), 75% of the MTD as a
single agent. After determination of the MTD, additional
patients were enrolled to obtain further information about
safety and efficacy. Therapy was planned for 1 year, but
patients could continue treatment until disease progression or intolerability.
Treatment Plan
Treatment consisted of 42-day cycles. Per original protocol, patients were to receive everolimus at increasing daily
doses (2.5 or 5 mg) along with escalating daily doses of
sunitinib (37.5 or 50 mg daily on a standard 4/2 schedule). Because of poor tolerability at the lowest daily dosing
cohorts (1 and 2), study protocol was amended; in subsequent cohorts, everolimus was escalated on a weekly dosing schedule (20 or 30 mg once weekly) with concurrent
daily sunitinib (4/2 schedule).
Adverse events were evaluated by National Cancer
Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse
Events version 3.0 on days 0, 14, and 28 of cycles 1 and 2,
and days 0 and 28 of subsequent cycles. Escalation to a
new dose cohort was based on safety evaluation of the previous cohort after 1 cycle of treatment. Hematologic
DLTs included grade 4 neutropenia lasting >7 days, any
episode of febrile neutropenia, and grade 3 thrombocytopenia lasting >7 days or complicated by bleeding. Nonhematologic DLTs included any grade 3 or 4 toxicity
lasting 7 days, with the exception of skin or hair discoloration, alopecia, and hyperamylasemia or hyperlipasemia
without clinical or other evidence of pancreatitis. In addition, persistent grade 3 or 4 nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea
despite maximal medical care, clinical evidence of congestive heart failure, grade 4 hypertension, or grade 3 hypertension not controlled by medication were considered
DLTs. Also included were grade 4 proteinuria, episodes
of gastrointestinal perforation, grade 4 hemorrhage,
wound dehiscence requiring intervention, and any grade
thromboembolic event.
Patients who experienced grade 3 and 4 adverse
events received dose adjustments to 1 or both drugs, as per
protocol. Dose reductions to sunitinib were made in
12.5-mg decrements. Everolimus was reduced in 2.5-mg
decrements for daily dosing; patients receiving everolimus
weekly decelerated to the next lower level. Toxicities warranting dose reductions of sunitinib <25 mg/day or
everolimus <2.5 mg every other day (daily dosing) or 15
mg/week (weekly dosing) were cause to be withdrawn

1870

from study. Patients were followed for adverse events for
30 days after the last dose of everolimus and sunitinib.
Antitumor Assessment
Treatment response was assessed by Response Evaluation
Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.0 at day 28 of the first
4 cycles and on even cycles thereafter, earlier when progressive disease (PD) was suspected. Imaging was repeated
to confirm partial response (PR) or complete response at
least 4 weeks after initial documentation of response and
at the end of treatment. Progression-free survival (PFS)
was measured from the first dose of study drug until documented disease progression or death, whichever occurred
first. Patients who did not meet these endpoints were censored at their last tumor assessment. Those removed from
the study because of toxicity were censored at study
termination.
Pharmacokinetics
Blood levels of everolimus, sunitinib, and its active metabolite N-desethyl sunitinib were evaluated at hours 0, 1, 2,
5, and 24 on days 14, 28, and 42 of cycles 1 and 2 in
patients receiving daily sunitinib with weekly everolimus
(ie, cohort 3-5).
Pharmacokinetic Methods
Everolimus concentrations were determined by use of a
liquid chromatography/mass spectroscopy assay.16 Sunitinib and N-desethyl sunitinib were extracted from 0.100
mL of human plasma by a liquid-liquid extraction procedure. The extracts were analyzed using liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry by an outside
contractor (Anapharm, Québec, Canada). The measured
plasma or blood concentration versus time data were subjected to noncompartmental analysis to determine pharmacokinetic data. All data were assumed to represent
steady-state values. The time to and value of the maximum blood or plasma concentration (Cmax) were determined by visual inspection of the concentration versus
time data for each analyte of interest. The terminal phase
rate constant (kz) was obtained by applying linear regression to the natural-log transformed concentration versus
time data in the terminal phase based on the concentrations measured from 0 to 24 hours postdose. The terminal
phase half-life (t1=2) was determined by the quotient of
0.693/kz.
For both everolimus and sunitinib, the area under
the curve (AUC) from time of dosing to the time of the
last measured concentration at 24 hours was determined

Everolimus and Sunitinib in Advanced RCC/Molina et al

using the linear trapezoidal rule. For sunitinib, this also
represented the steady-state AUC over the dosing interval
(AUC0-s), because of once-daily administration. For
weekly everolimus, AUC0-s was determined by 1 of 2
methods: 1) for patients with a predose (hour 0) everolimus
concentration above the lower limit of quantification, the 0
hours sample was used as the 168 hours postdose sample
for the prior dose, permitting calculation of the steady-state
AUC over the dosing interval (AUC0-s); 2) for patients
with 0 hours everolimus concentrations below the lower
limit of quantification, the AUC from time of dosing to infinity (AUC0-1) was determined instead. It was approximated as the sum of the AUC0-24 and the quotient of the
24 hours concentration divided by kz.
Statistics
The primary study objectives were to evaluate safety and
tolerability and to identify MTD for the combination of
everolimus and sunitinib. Toxicities were described by frequency and grade with the maximum grade over all cycles
used as the summary measure per patient. The anticipated
rates of DLTs were estimated between 10% and 50%. On
the basis of binomial distribution properties, the probability of dose escalation was estimated at 0.91, 0.71, 0.49,
0.31, and 0.17 if the true rates of DLTs were 10%, 20%,
30%, 40%, and 50%.
Secondary endpoints included objective response
rate, PFS, and pharmacokinetic properties of both drugs.
PFS was estimated with 95% confidence intervals using
Kaplan-Meier methods.17 Graphical methods analyzed
plasma and blood concentrations of study drugs and their
metabolites.

RESULTS
Patient Characteristics
Twenty patients were enrolled at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center between October 2006 and December
2008 (Table 2). Most patients (85%) had undergone
prior nephrectomy; none had received prior systemic therapy. Thirteen patients (65%) had tumors of conventional
clear cell type, and 7 patients (35%) had nonclear cell histology. Nineteen patients (95%) were classified as good or
intermediate risk based on Memorial Sloan-Kettering
Cancer Center Criteria.18
Treatment and Adverse Events

5 patients with DLT were removed from the study before
the end of cycle 1 and were not evaluable for response.
Patients were enrolled in 1 of 5 cohorts with defined
dosing levels (Table 1). All 3 patients in cohort 1 tolerated
the first cycle of therapy, but patient 3 was removed for
toxicity before the end of cycle 2. Two patients were enrolled in cohort 2. Both had a DLT (grade 3 thrombocytopenia and mucositis; grade 3 vomiting, respectively),
precluding additional enrollment to this cohort. One of
the 2 discontinued study treatment; the other continued
after a dose reduction and received therapy for 53 weeks,
at which time both drugs were discontinued because of
worsening diarrhea.
Because of toxicity in cohort 2, the dosing schedule
was altered, and subsequent cohorts received everolimus
on an escalated weekly schedule concurrent with daily
sunitinib. With weekly everolimus, none of the initial 3
patients in cohorts 3 or 4 had DLT. Two patients in

daily) experienced DLT (grade 3 mucositis and grade 3
thrombocytopenia with bleeding, respectively). Therefore,
3 additional patients were treated on the previous dose level
(cohort 4: everolimus 30 mg weekly, sunitinib 37.5 mg
daily). DLTs were observed in 1 of these additional 3
patients, and consisted of grade 3 mucositis and febrile
neutropenia. Overall, 1 of 6 patients in cohort 4 experienced DLT; this dosing level was determined as the MTD.
Frequent adverse events were observed beyond cycle
1 in cohort 4. One patient developed endocarditis during
cycle 4, required valve replacement, and suffered a cerebral vascular accident. A second experienced a gastrointestinal bleed secondary to a gastric ulcer during cycle 3 and
was taken off study. The third patient had progressive disease at the end of cycle 1 and was removed from study. A
fourth patient had severe mucositis and neutropenic fever
during cycle 1. The fifth patient completed 6 full cycles
on study despite multiple toxicities including grade 2
weight loss and diarrhea during cycle 2, and 1 episode of
grade 3 diarrhea during cycle 6. His dose was reduced to
the next lower level (everolimus 20 mg weekly, sunitinib
37.5 mg daily), and he continued treatment until disease
progression during cycle 16. A sixth patient was taken off
treatment during cycle 2 after a grade 4 embolic event
(pulmonary embolism). Thus, only 1 of 6 cohort 4
patients tolerated therapy beyond cycle 4.

1872

Given the frequency of adverse events with chronic
therapy at the MTD, 3 additional patients were enrolled
on the next lower dosing level (cohort 3, everolimus 20
mg weekly, sunitinib 37.5 mg daily). This was done to
confirm the highest dose level that allowed administration
of multiple cycles. None of the 6 patients enrolled in
cohort 3 was removed from study for toxicity, nor were 2
additional patients (1 each from cohorts 4 and 5) reduced
to the cohort 3 dose level.
Treatment-emergent adverse events appear in
Table 3. Pulmonary embolism was the only grade 4
adverse event. There were no treatment-associated deaths.
Table 4 shows the most frequent hematologic toxicities.
Response and Survival
Four of 20 patients (20%) were removed for DLT before
the end of cycle 1 and were not evaluable for response
(Table 5). Five of 16 evaluable patients (31%) achieved
confirmed PR (including 2 patients with clear cell histology, 2 patients with chromophobe histology, and 1
patient with papillary RCC). Ten of 16 evaluable patients
(62.5%) had stable disease (including 8 clear cell RCC
patients and 2 unclassified histology patients).
One patient (6%) had PD as best response (papillary
histology). PRs occurred with both daily and weekly
everolimus.

Grade 1 toxicities occurring in <10% of patients are excluded.

Seven patients were removed from study for PD,
and 8 for DLT or other toxicity. Five patients completed
planned treatment (therapy for 1 year). One of the 5
was enrolled in cohort 2, but received most therapy on the
lowest dosing level after a reduction during cycle 1. He
was taken off therapy for grade 3 colitis after 53 weeks of
therapy. The 4 remaining patients who completed the
study were treated on the cohort 3 dosing level; 2 had
undergone dose reductions from higher cohorts (Table 1).
Eventually, 2 of 5 patients had PD (after 58 and 95 weeks,
respectively); 2 developed toxicity requiring discontinuation (1 with recurrent grade 3 diarrhea at week 53; 1 with
recurrent grade 2 ear infections at week 75); after 17
cycles, the fifth patient was taken off treatment for surveillance. He eventually progressed and is receiving treatment
with single-agent sorafenib.
There were 8 deaths unrelated to treatment among
the 20 treated patients; 6 of 8 had been removed for PD
and 2 for excessive toxicity. With a median follow-up for
survivors of 12 weeks (patients discontinued because of
toxicity were censored at the time of removal), the median
PFS was 35 weeks (95% confidence interval, 16 weeksnot reached).

Pharmacokinetics
Serial serum everolimus, sunitinib, and N-desethyl sunitinib levels were collected on 13 of 15 patients receiving
everolimus on a weekly schedule. For comparison, everolimus levels were normalized to 20 mg/week, and sunitinib
levels and N-desethyl sunitinib levels to 37.5 mg/d. For
all 3 analytes, findings did not vary significantly at different time points throughout cycles 1 and 2 (Fig 1). For
everolimus, mean values at each time point for Cmax
(range, 91.3  41 to 131  51 ng/mL), t1=2 (range, 16.2
 5.6 to 21.5  10.1 hours), and AUC0-24 (range, 723
 256 to 897  297 ng  h/mL) were similar across days
14, 28, and 42 of cycles 1 and 2. Similarly, for sunitinib
and its active metabolite N-desethyl sunitinib, mean
Cmax (sunitinib, 46.1  15.0 to 61.7  16.5 ng/mL;
metabolite, 20.6  9.7 to 23.6  9.3 ng/mL), AUC
(sunitinib, 1022  357 to 1360  375 ng  h/mL;
metabolite, 454  206 to 523  225 ng  h/mL), and
Cmin (sunitinib, 39.5  16.1 to 53.4  14.0 ng/mL;
metabolite, 18.6  9.2 to 21.0  9.1 ng/mL) were
similar across days 14 and 28 of cycles 1 and 2. No
unexpected accumulation of everolimus, sunitinib, or
N-desethyl sunitinib was observed.

DISCUSSION
In this phase 1 trial, sunitinib and everolimus were combined in a treatment-naive population with advanced
RCC. The combination was poorly tolerated at standard
doses, and the everolimus schedule was changed from
daily to weekly administration. DLTs included thrombocytopenia with bleeding, febrile neutropenia, mucositis,
and vomiting. The MTD for the combination was determined to be everolimus 30 mg weekly, sunitinib 37.5 mg
daily. However, most patients did not tolerate this schedule with subsequent cycles, and the highest dosing level
for chronic treatment was everolimus 20 mg weekly/sunitinib 37.5 mg daily. One recent pharmacodynamic study
suggests that our derived weekly dose of everolimus has
suboptimal activity.19 Therapy in higher dosing cohorts
was associated with grade 3 or 4 toxicities.
The increased toxicity when combining both drugs
at low doses does not appear to be related to pharmacokinetic interactions. There was no evidence of unexpected
accumulation of everolimus, sunitinib, or its primary
active metabolite through cycles 1 and 2 (Fig. 1). Everolimus pharmacokinetics was similar to previous reports for

1874

the single agent,14 arguing against alterations in everolimus pharmacokinetics because of sunitinib. On a dosenormalized basis, assuming an intermittent schedule of
37.5 mg daily, we observed somewhat higher mean Cmin
levels for drug and metabolite than has been reported.20
The Cmin and AUC0-s seem closer to previous reports for
50 mg daily on a standard intermittent schedule.21,22
Comparisons with previous trials, however, are influenced
by small patient numbers and significant interpatient variation for sunitinib pharmacokinetic parameters.23,24
A secondary study objective was to assess antitumor
activity with the combination of sunitinib and everolimus.
Only 2 of 10 evaluable patients with clear cell RCC
achieved a PR, and only 1 remained on therapy for >1
year. In contrast, 3 of 6 patients with nonclear cell RCC
attained a PR (chromophobe, n ¼ 2; papillary, n ¼ 1), all
3 of whom achieved disease control for >1 year. Previous
studies of sunitinib in advanced nonclear cell RCC have
been disappointing. Our group recently reported a phase
2 trial of single-agent sunitinib in 23 patients with
advanced nonclear cell RCC, showing no responses with a
median PFS of 5.5 months.25 Similarly disappointing
results have been reported by other investigators.26,27 Our
findings suggest that antitumor activity might be because
of everolimus, which has not been studied in nonclear cell
RCC. Data for temsirolimus, a different mTOR inhibitor, suggest that this drug class has a benefit in nonclear
cell histology.28
Combined targeted agents in RCC have been under
investigation by several groups, and toxicity has been a
common theme. Several trials have evaluated the safety of
combining an mTOR inhibitor with a VEGF TKI. A
phase 1 study of sunitinib plus temsirolimus was terminated early because of DLT at the starting dose of temsirolimus 15 mg weekly and sunitinib 25 mg daily.29 Adverse
events included hemorrhage, thrombocytopenia, gastrointestinal toxicity, and severe infection. Because of efficacy
concerns at lower dosing levels, the study was terminated.
Similarly, the combination of sorafenib with temsirolimus
was associated with adverse effects at full doses, particularly mucocutaneous toxicity.30 Sorafenib with everolimus was better tolerated in a previously reported dosefinding study,31 but everolimus was reduced because of
DLTs in 2 of 4 patients treated at the dose of 5 mg daily.
Of 10 patients treated in the trial, 3 had a PR, 2 had stable
disease, and 5 showed evidence of progression. For clear
cell RCC, combinations of TKIs and mTOR inhibitors
appear to be feasible only at attenuated doses, which result
in diminishing efficacy and added toxicity.

Figure 1. Mean steady-state blood concentration versus time curves of everolimus (A), sunitinib (B), and N-desethyl sunitinib (C)
were measured across various study days in cycles 1 and 2. All concentrations were normalized to the most common dose level
used in this study (everolimus 20 mg once weekly, sunitinib 37.5 mg once daily).

Promising results of a phase 1-2 trial of temsirolimus
and bevacizumab32 led to an ongoing randomized phase 2
trial comparing this combination to sunitinib or bevacizumab with interferon-a in the first-line setting. Recent interim findings from the randomized phase 2 trial33
include more toxicity, higher dropout rates, and no
improvement in clinical efficacy in the temsirolimus/bevacizumab arm. Everolimus and bevacizumab were tolerated in combination at full doses in a phase 1 trial,34 and a
subsequent phase 2 study was recently reported.35 In 50
untreated patients, objective response rate was 30%, with
a median PFS of 9.1 months. Several ongoing phase 2 and
3 trials are investigating the combination of mTOR inhibition and bevacizumab.
In conclusion, in this phase 1 trial of metastatic
RCC, the combination of everolimus and sunitinib produced a high degree of toxicity requiring dose attenuation
of both drugs. Efficacy was observed, but was infrequent
in clear cell histology and less than expected with singleagent sunitinib at full doses. Responses observed in
papillary and chromophobe histology subtypes are intriguing, but require a dedicated phase 2 trial for better
characterization.
