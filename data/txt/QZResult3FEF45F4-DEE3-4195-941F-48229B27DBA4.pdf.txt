Abstract

Introduction

We have identified a natural compound that activates
apoptosis of epithelial cancer cells through activation of
tumor necrosis factor-A (TNF-A), TNF receptor (TNFR)associated death domain (TRADD), and caspases. The
molecule 1-hydroxy-5,7-dimethoxy-2-naphthalene-carboxaldehyde (HDNC, marmelin) was isolated and characterized from
ethyl acetate fraction of extracts of Aegle marmelos. HDNC
treatment inhibited the growth of HCT-116 colon cancer
tumor xenografts in vivo. Immunostaining for CD31 showed
that there was a significant reduction in microvessels in
the HDNC-treated animals, coupled with decreased cyclooxygenase-2, interleukin-8, and vascular endothelial growth
factor mRNA. Using hexoseaminidase assay, we determined
that HDNC inhibits proliferation of HCT-116 colon and HEp-2
alveolar epithelial carcinoma cells. Furthermore, the cancer
cells showed increased levels of activated caspase-3 and
induced G1 cell cycle arrest, which was suppressed by caspase3 inhibitors. HDNC induced TNF-A, TNFR1, and TRADD
mRNA and protein expression. Moreover, caspase-8 and Bid
activation, and cytochrome c release, were observed, suggesting the existence of a cross-talk between death receptor and
the mitochondrial pathways. HDNC inhibited AKT and
extracellular signal-regulated kinase phosphorylation both
in cells in culture and in tumor xenografts. In addition,
electrophoretic mobility shift assay and luciferase reporter
assays showed that HDNC significantly suppressed TNFA–mediated activation and translocation of nuclear factor-KB
(NF-KB). This was further confirmed by Western blot
analysis of nuclear extracts wherein levels of RelA, the p65
component of NF-KB, were significantly less in cells treated
with HDNC. Together, the data suggest that the novel
compound HDNC (marmelin) is a potent anticancer agent
that induces apoptosis during G1 phase of the cell cycle and
could be a potential chemotherapeutic candidate. [Cancer

Apoptosis is a genetically regulated form of cell death, in which
abnormal cells are eliminated from an organism, ensuring normal
development of multicellular organisms and maintenance of tissue
homeostasis (1). Therefore, an understanding of the molecular
mechanisms of apoptosis is not only of scientific importance but
may also have therapeutic value. A battery of signaling cascades is
involved in the ability of the cell to undergo apoptosis. One such is
a family of cysteine proteases, caspases, whose function in
apoptotic cell death has been studied in detail (2) and are
important mediators of apoptotic processes caused by various
inducers (3). They amplify the apoptotic signal and proteolytically
process numerous cellular target molecules with different
functions (4).
There are two major apoptotic pathways in mammalian cells
(5, 6). The extrinsic pathway is initiated by the binding of
transmembrane death receptors [e.g., Fas, tumor necrosis factor
receptor 1 (TNFR1), and TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand
(TRAIL) receptors] with cognate extracellular ligands (7). Ligand
receptors recruit adaptor proteins [e.g., TNFR-associated death
domain (TRADD) and FADD], which interact with and trigger the
activation of caspase-8. Activated caspase-8 then cleaves and
activates downstream effector caspases, such as caspase-3. In
contrast, the intrinsic pathway is characterized by disruption
of mitochondrial membrane integrity when cells are exposed to
various stresses (e.g., DNA-damaging agents; ref. 8). Mitochondrial
membrane integrity triggers apoptosis via both caspase-dependent
(e.g., the cytochrome c–caspase-9 pathway) and caspase-independent (e.g., the apoptosis-inducing factor pathway) mechanisms.
Cross-talk exists between the extrinsic and intrinsic pathways, as
activated caspase-8 can cleave Bid to produce truncated Bid (t-Bid),
which then binds to mitochondria and promotes mitochondrial
membrane integrity (9, 10). The subsequent release of cytochrome c
from mitochondria further facilitates the apoptotic process (11–13).
The importance of cell signaling cascades in normal cell
regulation and during disease condition has been realized
(14–16), and many well-known targets at the signaling levels have
been identified that are critical for the ability of cancer cells to
proliferate rapidly. Furthermore, the availability of high-throughput assays based on the above-said molecular targets has further
enhanced the process of drug discovery (17). Most anticancer
drugs are natural products or their semisynthetic analogues; well
known examples include Taxol, epothilone, camptothecin, daunomycin, and Vinca alkaloids (18, 19). Some of the plant-derived
anticancer compounds are beginning to enter clinical trials (19).

Cancer Research

Here, we report the identification of a novel compound,
1-hydroxy-5,7-dimethoxy-2-naphthalene-carboxaldehyde (HDNC),
from Aegle marmelos, a medicinal plant from India used for
treatment of cancer-related symptoms in the Indian system of
medicine (20). As a common term, we have named it marmelin.
HDNC inhibits the growth of HCT-116 colon cancer cell tumor
xenografts and angiogenesis in nude mice. In addition, HDNC
suppresses cancer cell proliferation while inducing apoptosis
through the induction of activation of TNF-a, TNFR1, TRADD,
caspase-8, and t-Bid, resulting in cytochrome c release and
activation of caspase-3.

Materials and Methods
Cells and reagents. HCT-116, HT-29 colon, AGS gastric, and HEp-2
alveolar cancer cells obtained from the American Type Culture Collection
were grown in DMEM and RPMI 1640 containing 10% heat-inactivated fetal
bovine serum (Sigma Chemical Co.) and 1% antibiotic-antimycotic solution
(Mediatech, Inc.) at 37jC in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2. The BD
RiboQuant multiprobe template set for hCK-3 and hAPO-3c was obtained
from BD PharMingen. Caspase-3 Inhibitor IV (Ac-DMQD-CHO) was
obtained from EMD Biosciences. Antibodies were obtained from Cell
Signaling. The medicinal plant A. marmelos was obtained from south India
and the species was authenticated (21, 22).
HCT-116 cell xenograft tumors in mice. Five-week-old male athymic
nude mice (The Jackson Laboratory) were maintained with water and
standard mouse chow ad libidum and used in protocols approved by the
Animal Studies Committee of the University. Animals were injected with
1  106 HCT-116 cells in the left and right flank with 100 AL Matrigel and
allowed to form xenograft. Marmelin (HDNC, 200 Ag/kg body weight) in 5%
Na2HCO3 buffer alone was administered i.p. daily for 23 d. Tumors were
measured weekly with a Vernier caliper and tumor volumes were
calculated according to the formula length  width  depth  0.5236.
At the end of treatment, the animals were sacrificed, and the tumors were
removed and weighed for use in histology (H&E and CD31) and gene
expression studies.
Proliferation and apoptosis assays. Cells were grown in 96-well plates
and treated with increasing doses of extracts or purified HDNC, and
proliferation was assessed by hexoseaminidase assay (23). The plates were
read at 405 nm in a Synergy HT microtiter plate reader (Bio-Tek
Instruments, Inc.). For apoptosis, caspase-3/7 activity was measured using
the Apo-ONE Homogeneous Caspase-3/7 Assay kit (Promega Corp.).
Cell cycle analysis. Cells were plated at a density of 5  105 per well on
six-well plates. After treatment for 24 h, cells were collected into flow
cytometry tubes and stained with propidium iodide at 4jC for 30 min in
the dark. Cell cycle analysis was performed with a Becton Dickinson
FACScan using an FL2 detector with a bandpass filter at specifications of
585 F 21 nm. In each analysis, 10,000 events were recorded.
RNA preparation and RNase protection assay. RNA was isolated from
the cells using Trizol method (Invitrogen); 20 Ag/lane were loaded for
RNase protection assay (RPA) using radiolabeled RiboQuant multiprobe
template set for human cytokines (hCK-3) or human apoptosis-related
genes (hAPO-3c), according to the manufacturer’s protocol.
Immunoblot analysis. Total lysates from cells or from tumor xenografts
and nuclear extracts were prepared and separated on 10% SDSpolyacrylamide gel and blotted onto Immobilon polyvinylidene difluoride
membranes (Millipore). Membranes were incubated overnight with the
indicated primary antibody followed by secondary antibody (1:5,000) for 1 h.
Specific proteins were detected by the enhanced chemiluminescence system
(Amersham Pharmacia Biotech).
ELISA assay. TNF-a levels in the medium were determined by sandwich
ELISA assays, using ELISA kits, according to the manufacturer’s protocol
(Pierce Biotechnology). The TNF-a ELISA kit has a detection range of 15.6
to 1,000 pg/mL and has a sensitivity of <2 pg/mL. Briefly, the samples are
incubated with the precoated wells followed by biotinylated second
antibody. The plates were subsequently incubated with streptavidin-

Cancer Res 2008; 68: (20). October 15, 2008

horseradish peroxidase reagent and 3,3¶,5,5¶-tetramethylbenzidine substrate
solution. The absorbance was read at 450 and 550 nm using the Synergy HT
plate reader.
Electrophoretic mobility shift assay analysis. HCT-116 cells
were pretreated with the HDNC for 2 h before coincubation with TNF-a
(10 ng/mL) for 1 h. Nuclear extracts were prepared using the NE-PER kit
(Pierce Biotechnology). Protein concentrations were determined using
bicinchoninic acid reagent (Pierce Biotechnology). Nuclear extracts (6 Ag)
were incubated with 32P-labeled double-stranded oligonucleotide containing a consensus NF-nB site (5¶-AGTTGAGGGGACTTTCCCAGGC-3¶;
binding site in bold and underlined) at room temperature for 30 min.
The protein-DNA complexes were size separated in a 4% native PAGE in
0.5% Tris-borate EDTA buffer and subjected to autoradiography.
Luciferase assay. HCT-116 cells were seeded in six-well dishes and
incubated until 80% confluent. Then, the cells were transfected with 3 Ag
pNFnB-Luc (Clontech) reporter plasmid using Fugene 6 reagent (Roche
Diagnostic). After 4 h of incubation, the cells were treated with extracts or
purified HDNC in the presence or absence of TNF-a for 24 h. Cells were
lysed and luciferase levels were determined using Luciferase Assay System
(Promega).
Statistical analysis. All values are expressed as the mean F SE. Data
were analyzed using a paired two-tailed t test. A P value of <0.05 was
considered statistically significant.

Results
HDNC inhibits cancer cell proliferation. Recent studies have
shown that administration of hydroalcoholic extract of A.
marmelos to Ehrlich ascites carcinoma-bearing Swiss albino mice
resulted in a dose-dependent remission of the tumor (21).
Furthermore, a recent study showed no toxicity in rats administered extracts of leaves from this plant (22). These data, taken
together, suggest that the plant encodes antitumor activity with a
low toxicity profile. Accordingly, we aimed to identify an active
compound in A. marmelos that is a potent inhibitor of solid
tumors. Powdered A. marmelos plant material was extracted with
ethanol and fractionated into hexane, dichloromethane, ethyl
acetate, and n-butanol soluble fractions (data not shown). The
effect of the solvent fractions on the proliferation of cancer cells
was evaluated for up to 72 h. Dose-response analysis revealed
10 Ag/mL of ethyl acetate fraction (Fig. 1A). The active ethyl
acetate fraction was subsequently fractionated by silica column
chromatography using a combination of hexane and ethyl acetate
solvents. According to their TLC profiles, they were pooled into
12 fractions (data not shown). Fraction 5 showed maximum
activity in 24 h. This compound was characterized as HDNC with a
molecular mass of 232.23 (Fig. 1B) by nuclear magnetic resonance
(NMR) and mass spectrometry (MS) analysis. We have also given
the compound a common name marmelin because it was isolated
from A. marmelos. Dose-response analysis revealed significant
reduction in cell proliferation of multiple cancer cells at a dose
of 50 Amol/L HDNC (Fig. 1A; Supplementary Fig. S1). In contrast,
HDNC did not inhibit proliferation of normal mouse embryo
fibroblasts for doses up to 500 Amol/L (data not shown). Together,
these data show that the purified HDNC is a potent antiproliferative
molecule with activity against epithelial cancer cells of different
origin.
Caspase-3 activation is essential for HDNC-mediated cell
apoptosis. Caspase-3 is a key effector in the apoptosis pathway,
amplifying the signal from initiator caspases, such as caspase-8
(24, 25). To determine whether cells undergo apoptosis, we first
performed a caspase-3/7 assay after the cells were incubated
with purified HDNC. There was a dose-dependent increase in

Marmelin and Anticancer Activity

Figure 1. HDNC inhibits growth of cancer cells. A, dose-response analysis of HEp-2 cells to A. marmelos ethyl acetate fraction and purified HDNC. HEp-2 cells were
incubated with increasing concentrations of the ethyl acetate fraction of A. marmelos extracts (0–100 Ag/mL) or HDNC (0–500 Amol/L) for 24, 48, and 72 h and cell
proliferation was determined using hexoseaminidase activity. The graph is plotted as percent inhibition when compared with control, buffer-treated cells. HDNC
treatment resulted in a significant dose-dependent decrease in cell number in the cells when compared with controls. Results are representative of three independent
experiments. B, topological structure of HDNC. The structure of the active molecule was determined as HDNC. C, HDNC treatment induces apoptosis in HEp-2
cells. Top, cells incubated with increasing concentrations of HDNC or curcumin (0–10 Amol/L) were analyzed for apoptosis. HDNC treatment increased number of
apoptotic cells compared with either curcumin-treated or untreated control. Results are representative of three independent experiments. *, P < 0.001. Bottom, HDNC
induces caspase-3, an apoptosis mediator. Lysates from HEp-2 cells were incubated with 10 Ag/mL ethyl acetate fraction of A. marmelos extract or 25 Amol/L HDNC
and were analyzed by Western blotting for caspase-3 protein expression levels using rabbit anti-caspase-3 antibody. HDNC-treated cells show cleaved (activated)
caspase-3, whereas untreated or buffer-treated cells have no cleaved caspase-3. D, DNA content (propidium iodide) and cell cycle analysis of HDNC-treated cells.
HEp-2 cells were treated with the ethyl acetate fraction (10 Ag/mL) or HDNC (25 Amol/L) for 36 h. M1, sub-G1-G0 peak. Apoptosis was measured as the percentage of
cells containing hypodiploid amounts of DNA (sub-G1-G0 peak). HDNC treatment leads to increased number of cells in the sub-G1-G0 phase as indicated by the
increase in M1 peak compared with control. However, this is reduced when cells are also treated with the caspase-3 inhibitor AC-DMQD-CHO. Graphs are
representative of data collected from at least three experiments.

caspase-3/7 activity, suggesting that the compound induces cells
to undergo apoptosis (Fig. 1C, top). To further determine whether
the apoptotic activity is due to caspase-3, Western blot analysis
was performed with extracts from HEp-2 cells. Significant
induction in caspase-3 activation was observed in cells treated
with either the ethyl acetate fraction or purified HDNC (Fig. 1C,
bottom). To confirm that caspase-3 activation is required for
HDNC-mediated apoptosis, cell cycle was performed. A significant
increase in cells in sub-G1 phase was observed when the cells
were treated with either the ethyl acetate fraction (10 Ag/mL) or
purified HDNC (50 Amol/L; Fig. 1D). Furthermore, coincubation

with a specific inhibitor of caspase-3, Ac-DMQD-CHO, resulted in
a significant reduction in cells in sub-G1 phase. Similar results
were obtained with HCT-116 and HT-29 cells (data not shown).
These data suggest that HDNC-mediated induction of apoptosis is
mediated by caspase-3 activation.
HDNC inhibits tumor growth. To evaluate the role of HDNC in
tumor proliferation in vivo, we examined the ability of the
compound to suppress the growth of human cancer cell xenografts
in nude mice. Colon cancer cell–induced xenograft tumors were
allowed to develop and grow to a size of 500 mm3, following which
HDNC was administered i.p. for 3 weeks daily. HDNC significantly

Figure 2. HDNC inhibits cancer tumor xenograft growth in vivo. A, HCT-116 cells were injected to the flanks of nude mice and palpable tumors were allowed to
develop for 7 d. Subsequently, HDNC was injected daily i.p. for up to 21 d. On day 22, tumors were excised and subjected to further analyses. Tumor volumes
in HDNC-administered mice were smaller than that of control mice. B, tumor size was measured every week. There was a significant reduction in tumor size from
HDNC-treated animals when compared with untreated controls. C, HDNC treatment resulted in significantly lower tumor weight and volume when compared with
controls. D, HDNC suppresses tumor angiogenesis. Immunohistochemistry shows that HDNC treatment significantly reduced the expression of CD31, an endothelial
cell–specific surface marker in tumor xenografts. The proteins are stained brown. Microvessel density was significantly reduced in the xenografts of HDNC-treated
animals.

inhibits the growth of the tumor xenografts (Fig. 2A). Whereas
the control tumors grew during the treatment period, reaching a
size of 2,000 mm3, tumors in the HDNC-treated animals were
smaller throughout. The excised tumors from the HDNC-treated
animals averaged f1.3 g, whereas those from the control group
weighed between 2.0 and 2.5 g (Fig. 2C). In addition, tumor
volumes were significantly decreased (Fig. 2B and C). There was
no apparent change in liver weight, spleen weight, or body weight
in the wild-type animals treated with HDNC (data not shown).
These data imply that HDNC is a potential therapeutic for treatment of colon cancers and that it is relatively nontoxic to mice.

Cancer Res 2008; 68: (20). October 15, 2008

HDNC inhibits angiogenesis. A key feature of tumors is the
development of microcapillaries. Given the reduction in the size of
the tumors following HDNC treatment, we determined the effect of
the compound on tumor vascularization by staining for the
endothelial-specific antigen CD31. HDNC treatment leads to lower
levels of CD31 staining and to the obliteration of the normal
vasculature that is associated with tumor angiogenesis (Fig. 2D).
Furthermore, HDNC treatment resulted in a significant reduction
in microvessel density (Supplementary Fig. S2). Two key factors
that regulate capillary growth in the tumors are vascular
endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and interleukin-8 (IL-8), and

prostaglandins and the other tumors promoting mediators are
known to induce their expression in epithelial cells. Prostaglandin
production is regulated by cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), a protein
that is overexpressed at multiple cancers (26–28). Therefore, we
next determined the effects of HDNC treatment on COX-2, VEGF,
and IL-8 expression. HDNC treatment reduced COX-2, VEGF, and
IL-8 mRNA levels in the tumor xenografts (Supplementary Fig. S3).
HDNC induces TNF-A, which exerts its activity through
recruitment of TRADD. TNF-a is pleiotropic cytokine involved in
inflammatory and apoptotic responses. To determine the effect of
HDNC on TNF-a expression, we performed a RPA analysis. TNF-a
levels were significantly up-regulated in HEp-2 cells following
treatment with HDNC (Fig. 3A). Similarly, incubation of HCT-116
and AGS cells resulted in increased expression of TNF-a at the RNA
and protein levels (Fig. 3B and C). Binding of TNF-a to its cognate
receptor TNFR1 results in receptor trimerization and subsequent
binding to an adapter molecule, TRADD. TRADD in turn recruits

TNF-associated factor 2, and subsequent activation of the nuclear
factor-nB (NF-nB) and c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK) pathways.
In addition, activated TRADD has been shown to recruit a second
adaptor (FADD), which in turn activates caspase-8. To determine
whether these proteins are affected by HDNC, a RPA analysis with
TNF signaling templates was performed. RPA analysis revealed the
activation of TNFR1 (p55) receptor, TRADD, and Fas. Further, we
also observed the activation of caspase-8 (Fig. 4A). Immunoblot
analysis also showed activation of TRADD on treatment with both
ethyl acetate fraction and HDNC compared with the untreated
controls (Fig. 4B). Similarly, activation of caspase-8 was confirmed
(Fig. 4B).
HDNC induces Bid cleavage leading to cytochrome c release.
Activated caspase-8 can cleave Bid, a Bcl2-interacting protein, at
the COOH terminus. The activated t-Bid subsequently translocates
to the mitochondria where it triggers cytochrome c release (29).
Because caspase-8 was induced following HDNC treatment, we

cellular responses through MAPK to induce NF-nB, we next
determined whether HDNC-mediated induction of TNF-a resulted
in increased AKT and/or ERK activity. Western blot analyses
showed TNF-a–mediated increase in AKT and ERK phosphorylation (Fig. 5A and B). However, pretreatment with HDNC or ethyl
acetate fraction inhibited TNF-a–mediated induction of AKT and
ERK phosphorylation (Fig. 5A and B; Supplementary Fig. S4).
Further confirmation that HDNC inhibits AKT and ERK phosphorylation was obtained when extracts of tumor xenografts were
subjected to Western blot analyses (Fig. 5C and D; Supplementary
Fig. S4). Taken together, these data suggest that HDNC is a potent
suppressor of TNF-a–mediated signaling.
Suppression of TNF-A–induced NF-KB activation in colon
cancer cells. A key downstream target of TNF-a–mediated NF-nB
activation is IL-8 (33–35). To determine the effect of HDNC on
TNF-a–mediated NF-nB activation, we first determined the
expression of IL-8 in HCT-116 cells. Although HDNC did not affect
baseline IL-8 expression, it inhibited TNF-a–mediated induction of
IL-8 expression in the cells (Fig. 6A). To determine if this is due
to loss of NF-nB activation, we performed an electrophoretic
mobility shift assay (EMSA) analysis with nuclear extracts of
HCT-116 cells. HDNC suppressed TNF-a–induced NF-nB activation (Fig. 6B). Further confirmation of this inhibition was shown
by Western blot analysis for RelA, the p65 component of NF-nB.
RelA levels were significantly reduced in the nucleus of cells

treated with ethyl acetate fraction of A. marmelos extract (10 Ag/mL) or
purified HDNC (25 Amol/L) have higher levels of TRADD, caspase-8,
cleaved Bid (t-Bid ), and cytochrome c proteins.

next analyzed whether Bid is cleaved. Western blot analysis showed
significant levels of t-Bid (Fig. 4B). Furthermore, activation of
cytosolic cytochrome c was observed following HDNC treatment
(Fig. 4B). This observation further strengthens the hypothesis that
a cross-talk exists between intrinsic and extrinsic pathways in case
of HDNC-induced apoptosis.
Suppression of AKT and extracellular signal-regulated
kinase activation in colon cancer cells. AKT is a serine/
threonine kinase involved in cell proliferation, survival/apoptosis
inhibition, and angiogenesis (30, 31). Similarly, the p42/p44
extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) mitogen-activated
protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway controls cell growth,
differentiation, and survival (32). Because TNF-a modulates

that HDNC inhibits NF-nB activation, we transiently transfected

compared with the buffer-treated controls. Furthermore, they also
inhibited TNF-a–induced NF-nB transcriptional activity (Fig. 6D).
Because TNF-a–mediated inflammatory and pro-proliferative
responses involve activation of NF-nB, these data suggest that
HDNC enhances TNF-a–mediated apoptotic response in cancer
cells by inhibiting the NF-nB activation pathway.

Discussion
The ability of cancer cells to avert the apoptotic program has
been identified as one of the major mechanisms for the
development of cancers (15). In a previous study, extracts from
A. marmelos were found to inhibit the proliferation of multiple
human tumor cell lines in in vitro assays, including the leukemic
K562, erythroleukemic HEL, melanoma Colo38, and breast cancer
MCF7 and MDA-MB-231 cell lines (36). In the present study, we
have also shown that the ethyl acetate fraction of A. marmelos
significantly inhibits proliferation of many cells (Fig. 1A ).
Subsequently, we have identified a single molecule, which was
structurally characterized as HDNC, by detailed NMR and MS
analysis (Fig. 1B). This pure compound was also capable of
inducing apoptosis to a variety of cell lines. Our in vivo studies have
further shown that HDNC inhibits the growth of HCT-116 colon
cancer xenografts in nude mice, with a significant reduction in the
number of microcapillaries (Fig. 2). Furthermore, we have
determined that HDNC acts to inhibit tumor growth by inducing
TNF-a–mediated apoptosis program.
Two major apoptotic pathways exist in mammalian cells (5).
The extrinsic pathway is initiated by the binding of transmembrane death receptors (e.g., Fas, TNFR1, and TRAIL receptors) with
cognate extracellular ligands. Ligand-bound receptors recruit
adaptor proteins (e.g., FADD), which interact with and trigger
the activation of caspase-8. Activation of TNFR p55 expression by
both the crude fraction and pure HDNC and activation of TNF-a
imply that this compound was capable of inducing apoptosis.
TNF-a is known to trigger the expression of a large battery of
genes in diverse cell types (37–39), including its specific role in
triggering apoptotic death via TNFR1 receptor (40). Our studies
show that the presence of the compound causes significantly
higher expression levels of TNF-a in the cells coupled with
overexpression of TRADD driving the cell into apoptosis via TNFa–TRADD cascade. In this regard, it should be noted that TNFR1
has been the only receptor expressed in HEp-2 cells (41). However,
the colon cancer cells used in the study do express both TNF
receptors, but only TNFR1 was found to be induced, further
strengthening our conclusion that HDNC acts through the TNFR1
receptor to induce apoptosis.

The intrinsic pathway is characterized by disruption of mitochondrial membrane integrity when cells are exposed to stresses
such as DNA-damaging agents (6). Disruption of mitochondrial
membrane integrity can trigger apoptosis via both caspase-9–
dependent pathway that includes the truncation of Bid protein,
which then binds to mitochondria and promotes mitochondrial
membrane integrity disruption. Although it is not known whether
HDNC can activate caspase-9, our findings suggest the possibility
of a cross-talk between the two pathways, as activated caspase-8
can cleave Bid to produce t-Bid.
NF-nB/Rel transcription factors can block apoptosis induced by
TNF-a (37, 42, 43). The antiapoptotic activity of NF-nB is also
crucial for immunity, tumorigenesis, and cancer chemoresistance
(37). With respect to TNF-a, the NF-nB–mediated suppression of
apoptosis involves inhibition of JNK cascade. The control of TNFRinduced killing serves as paradigm for the antiapoptotic activity of
NF-nB (44, 45). TNF-a normally has less or no cytotoxic effect
unless NF-nB activation or protein synthesis is blocked (45). In line
with this, EMSA and reporter gene analyses reveal suppression of
TNF-a–induced NF-nB activation in colon cancer cells. We infer
that this may aid in TNF-a–induced apoptosis by HDNC. However,
further studies are required to determine whether knockdown of
the NF-nB activation is essential for HDNC activity.
Caspases are activated in a branched protease cascade and
control distinct downstream processes in TNF-a–induced and
Fas-induced apoptosis (4, 46). To confirm whether induction of
apoptosis is due to caspase-3 activation, inhibitor studies using
specific caspase-3 reveal marked reduction in the induction of
HDNC-mediated apoptosis. It would, however, also be interesting to
determine whether additional pathways exist for HDNC-mediated
caspase-3 activation by using dominant-negative mutant forms of
caspase-8 and caspase-9. Nevertheless, the ability of the compound
HDNC from A. marmelos to inhibit cell proliferation and induce
apoptosis by a multiprolonged cascade of events suggests that it
might be an ideal therapeutic for many solid tumors.
