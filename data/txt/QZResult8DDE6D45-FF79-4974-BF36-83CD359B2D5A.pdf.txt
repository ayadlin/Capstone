ABSTRACT
Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), a malignant brain tumor with a dismal prognosis,
shows a high level of chemo- and radioresistance and, therefore, attempts to
sensitize glioma cells are highly desired. Here, we addressed the question of whether
artesunate (ART), a drug currently used in the treatment of malaria, enhances the
killing response of glioblastoma cells to temozolomide (TMZ), which is the first-line
therapeutic for GBM. We measured apoptosis, necrosis, autophagy and senescence,
and the extent of DNA damage in glioblastoma cells. Further, we determined the
tumor growth in nude mice. We show that ART enhances the killing effect of TMZ in
glioblastoma cell lines and in glioblastoma stem-like cells. The DNA double-strand
break level induced by TMZ was not clearly enhanced in the combined treatment
regime. Also, we did not observe an attenuation of TMZ-induced autophagy, which is
considered a survival mechanism. However, we observed a significant effect of ART
on homologous recombination (HR) with downregulation of RAD51 protein expression
and HR activity. Further, we found that ART is able to inhibit senescence induced by
TMZ. Since HR and senescence are pro-survival mechanisms, its inhibition by ART
appears to be a key node in enhancing the TMZ-induced killing response. Enhancement
of the antitumor effect of TMZ by co-administration of ART was also observed in a
mouse tumor model. In conclusion, the amelioration of TMZ-induced cell death upon
ART co-treatment provides a rational basis for a combination regime of TMZ and ART
in glioblastoma therapy.

INTRODUCTION

with thymine during DNA replication leads to O6-MeG/T
mismatches that are recognized by the mismatch repair
system (MMR), which then performs erroneous repair
cycles [5, 6]. Secondary lesions, most probably extended
gaps, are created during this faulty repair process, leading
to blockage of DNA replication in the next replication
cycle, which in turn gives rise to DNA double-strand
breaks (DSB) [7, 8]. These DSB trigger cell death by
apoptosis, which we have shown is effectively induced in
glioma cells as a late response following TMZ treatment
[9]. In addition to apoptosis, it was shown that TMZ also
induces autophagy and senescence in glioma cells [10–12].
Thus, identifying agent(s) that inhibit pro-survival
pathways such as autophagy and replicative senescence

Treatment of the highly aggressively growing
brain tumor glioblastoma multiforme (glioma WHO
grade IV; GBM) is usually not effective, and patients
have a dismal prognosis with a median survival of 14.6
months [1]. Treatment consists of resection of the tumor
followed by radio- and chemotherapy [1]. First line drug
in chemotherapy is the methylating agent temozolomide
(TMZ) [2], which induces a dozen DNA adducts [3].
Among these, the minor adduct O6-methylguanine
(O6-MeG) represents the most severe killing lesion,
provided it is not repaired by O6-methylguanine-DNA
methyltransferase (MGMT) [4]. Mispairing of O6-MeG

and foster cell death pathways is highly desired and
anticipated to support brain tumor therapy.
Artesunate (ART) is a semi-synthetic derivative
of the herbal Artemisia annua ingredient artemisinin,
which was extensively used for centuries in traditional
Chinese medicine (TCM) and is currently being used as
antimalarial drug because of its potent activity against the
chloroquine resistant pathogen Plasmodium falciparum
[13]. It is a natural endoperoxide that forms intracellular
reactive oxygen species (ROS) [14]. ART was shown to
exert cytotoxic activity on cancer cells [15], which was
extensively studied on different experimental systems,
making it a candidate for a cancer chemotherapeutic agent
[16]. Previously, we have shown that ART is a powerful
inducer of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in tumor cells,
triggering DNA damage including 8-oxo-guanine and
DSB [17, 18]. Experiments with tumor cells other than
GBM indicated a link to autophagy, but the precise
mechanism of action of ART remained undissolved [19].
Here, we studied the impact of ART as a modulator of
TMZ-induced death in glioma cells. We show that
established glioblastoma and glioblastoma stem-like
cells are sensitized to TMZ by ART co-treatment. The
underlying mechanism does not rest on amelioration of
DNA damage such as DSB, but includes ART-mediated
inhibition of senescence, which is efficiently triggered
by TMZ. The therapeutic effect of TMZ was also found
being enhanced in a xenograft mouse model when TMZ
was co-administered with ART, which was non-toxic and
well tolerated. These pre-clinical data provide a rational
basis for a treatment strategy using TMZ in combination
with ART, which warrants clinical trials.

hypothesized that ART-induced reactive oxygen species
(ROS) are involved in triggering cell death. To determine
the basal cellular ROS level, a live cell ROS indicator
(H2DCFDA) was used. As shown in Figure 2A, A172
and U87MG cells had a similar basal ROS level, which
was however significantly lower than that determined in
LN229 cells. The induced ROS level after ART treatment
increased with time and induction was almost the same
in A172 and LN229, and clearly higher in U87MG cells
(Figure 2B). This was unexpected since U87MG is the
most ART resistant cell line. Obviously, the ART-induced
ROS level does not determine the survival response of
the cells. Further, we investigated in LN229 cells whether
ART induces necroptosis and whether ROS formation is
mediated by the necrosome, a trigger of necroptosis. To
this end, we used NST-1, which is a specific inhibitor of
the receptor-interacting protein 1 (RIP1) that is part of the
necrosome. It delivers pro-necroptotic signals including
ROS, lysosomal membrane permeabilisation (LMP) and
ATP depletion [22]. First, we determined whether NST-1
has an effect on the formation of intracellular ROS
induced by ART. As determined 3, 6 and 12 h after the
addition of ART to the medium, the treatment with NST-1
did not reduce significantly the intracellular ROS level
(Figure 2C). In this experiment, treatment with H2O2 and
tBOOH served as positive controls for intracellular ROS.
These data indicate that the necrosome does not contribute
to ART-induced ROS production, which is in accordance
with the described autocatalytic ROS forming mechanism
of ART [23]. Interestingly, if NST-1 was co-administered
we observed upon ART treatment a significant reduction
of cell death by necrosis (from more than 50% to less than
30%), but not apoptosis (Figure 2D). Since NST-1 is an
inhibitor of necroptosis, the data indicate that a significant
fraction of cell death induced by ART (administered at
high dose level of 30 µg/ml) is due to necroptosis.

RESULTS
ART induces apoptosis and necrosis in glioma
cells

ART ameliorates cell death induced by TMZ

We used the cell lines LN229, A172 and U87MG,
derived from high-grade gliomas, which are p53 wild-type,
similar to most of the gliomas [20, 21]. To assess whether
ART induces apoptosis and necrosis in glioma cells, they
were treated with ART (30 µg/ml). The induction of cell
death (sum of apoptosis and necrosis) at different times
after the onset of treatment was determined by annexin
V/PI staining. As shown in Figure 1A, ART induces cell
death dose-dependently, with LN229 and A172 strongly
responding, while U87MG was more refractory. The time
course experiment shows that cell death occurs 48 h after
the onset of treatment and increases further in LN229 and
A172 (Figure 1B). Cell death induced by ART was a result
of apoptosis (Figure 1C) and necrosis (Figure 1D).

Glioblastoma cells respond to TMZ by undergoing
apoptosis at late time intervals after TMZ treatment
(72 h and later) [9]. The late response is explained by
processing of O6-MeG adducts, which needs mismatch
repair and DNA replication, occurring in the 2nd DNA
replication cycle after treatment and even later [7]. To
investigate whether ART enhances the killing response of
glioblastoma cells to TMZ, we compared their survival
after single and combined TMZ/ART treatment. First,
we conducted colony formation experiments. As shown
in Figure 3, ART significantly enhanced reproductive
cell death induced by TMZ in LN229 (Figure 3A, 3B),
A172 (Figure 3C, 3D) and U87MG cells (Figure 3E, 3F).
Similar experiments were conducted by means of annexin
V/PI double staining and flow cytometry. ART enhanced
cell death (sum of apoptosis and necrosis) of LN229 cells
144 h after TMZ treatment significantly from 16 to 36%
(Figure 4A). The same was observed in A172 (Figure 4B)

and U87MG cells (Figure 4C). Of note, U87MG were
more resistant to TMZ than LN229 and A172 cells, which
is conform to data obtained with ART (see Figure 1A).
We also investigated glioblastoma stem-like cells for
cell death after combination treatment with TMZ and ART,
using the glioblastoma stem-like cell line G112SP. Similar
to the glioblastoma lines, G112SP cells were significantly
sensitized to TMZ by ART (Figure 4D). We should
note that the TMZ concentration in these co-treatment
experiments was quite low (50 µM for the glioblastoma
lines and 2 µM for G112SP cells), which induced < 20%
cell death in each of the lines. The concentration of ART
was also low (15 µg/ml); it induced only marginally
cytotoxicity (Figure 1). Despite this low dose level of
ART, it was clearly effective in ameliorating the TMZinduced death in glioblastoma cells and stem-like cells.

cells using immunofluorescence staining for γH2AX.
Representative images of immunofluorescent stained
nuclei for LN229, A172 and U87MG cells are shown in
Figure 5A. The quantification of γH2AX foci revealed
that the low dose ART (15 µg/ml) used in this setting
did not induce much γH2AX (16, 3 and 2 foci/cell for
LN229, A172 and U87MG respectively, which was only
for LN229 slightly above the control level). In contrast,
TMZ (50 µM) induced a high level of γH2AX foci, which
was significant above the control (Figure 5B). Importantly,
we did not observe an augmentation of γH2AX foci
induced by TMZ in the co-treatment setting (Figure 5B).
Obviously, the low dose of ART, which ameliorated
TMZ-induced cell death, had no clear impact on the DSB
level induced by TMZ.

Effect of ART on DSB induced by TMZ

ART inhibits Rad51 expression and homologous
recombination

In previous studies we showed that both TMZ
and ART are able to induce DSB [7, 18]. Although the
mechanism for DSB induction for both agents is different,
we anticipated that the combination of both treatments
causes a synergistic effect. To prove this, we measured
DSB after single and combined treatments in glioblastoma

A mechanism that protects against TMZ-induced
cell death is homologous recombination (HR), which
was shown to reduce the TMZ-induced DSB level
[24]. Therefore, we wondered whether ART might
have an impact on the HR efficiency following TMZ
administration. A key player in HR is Rad51 [25]. As

Effect of HR on TMZ/ART-induced cell death

shown in Figure 6A, Rad 51 expression was enhanced
in LN229 cells if they were treated with TMZ. In the
presence of ART, however, this enhancement was not
observed; there was rather a decline in Rad51 expression.
In A172 and U87MG cells we did not observe an
enhancement in the Rad51 level following TMZ, however,
there was a clear decline in Rad51 protein when cells were
exposed to ART. This was also observed in the glioma
stem-like cells G112SP (Figure 6A). Additionally, we
determined the HR capacity using an HR plasmid assay
(as described in Material and Methods). As a control, we
treated the LN229 cells with an inhibitor of DNA-PK,
which blocks non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) and at
the same time ameliorates the HR level, which is known
to be a compensatory effect [24]. Treatment with ART
inhibited the cellular HR activity time dependently, with a
nearly complete inhibition achieved 72 h after addition of
ART to the cells. In these experiments we used low nontoxic doses of ART of 5 µg/ml (Figure 6B) and 7.5 µg/ml
(Figure 6C) to avoid any interference with killing effects.

Does downregulation of HR impact survival
following TMZ and ART? This question was addressed
by downregulating Rad51 with shRNA. As shown
in Figure 6D, Rad51 downregulation results in an
enhancement of cell death (apoptosis plus necrosis
measured by annexin V/PI) following treatment with
TMZ and also with ART. In the combined setting TMZ/
ART cell death was also significantly enhanced in Rad51
downregulated cells (Figure 6D). This supports the critical
role of HR in defense against TMZ- and ART-induced cell
death. Inhibition of NHEJ by DNA-PKi was without effect
on TMZ-induced cell death while ameliorating death
following ART (Figure 6E). This is in line with previous
data showing a marginal role for NHEJ in TMZ induced
death of glioma cells [26], while for ART both HR and
NHEJ are involved in the defense against DNA damage
[17, 18]. Overall, the data support the notion that HR has
a significant impact on TMZ/ART induced cell death.

Effect of ART on TMZ-induced autophagy

(Figure 7). Combination of ART and TMZ did not show a
reduction of autophagy compared to TMZ single treatment
demonstrating that ART, administered in this low dose
range (15 µg/ml), does not stimulate TMZ-induced
apoptosis by suppression of autophagy.

We have recently demonstrated that TMZ induces
autophagy, which serves as a survival mechanism
inhibiting apoptosis [11]. It was also shown that ART
interrupts the autophagy process in MCF-7 breast cancer
cells [19]. Therefore, we hypothesized that a possible
mechanism of ART for sensitizing glioblastoma cells
to TMZ rests on affecting the autophagy process. We
analyzed glioblastoma cells by staining autophagic
vesicles (Cyto ID assay) after treatment with TMZ. TMZ
clearly induced autophagy in LN229 glioblastoma cells,
while treatment with ART did not affect significantly
the basal autophagy level in LN229 and A172 cells,
and only slightly enhanced the level in U87MG cells

Effect of ART on TMZ-induced senescence
In previous studies we showed that TMZ induces
senescence, which reduces the level of cell death by
apoptosis and necrosis [11]. This let us to consider the
idea that ART might have an impact on TMZ-induced
senescence. We investigated the induction of senescence in
glioblastoma cells using the C12FDG assay, which measures
senescence-associated

activity [27]. Treatment with low dose of ART does not lead
to induction of senescence in LN229, A172 and U87MG
cells (Figure 8A–8C). In contrast, TMZ (50 µM) induced a
high level of senescence in LN229 cells (Figure 8A) and a
moderate level in A172 and U87MG cells (Figure 8B, 8C).
TMZ-induced senescence was significantly reduced in
LN229 and A172 cells when they where post-treated
with ART (Figure 8A, 8B). The generally more resistant
U87MG cells were not responding (Figure 8C). TMZinduced senescence was also reduced by ART treatment
in glioblastoma stem-like cells (Figure 8D). The data
support the notion that ART has a potential to impact
TMZ-induced senescence.

single dose of TMZ (200 mg/ kg body weight) followed
by treatment with ART, which was administered daily
in drinking water (1 mg/ ml). As shown in Figure 9,
ART and TMZ as single treatment caused a reduction
in tumor growth, with TMZ being more effective. The
combined treatment, however, inhibited tumor growth
most efficiently with a complete remission of tumors
in the observation period. Furthermore, mouse survival
was investigated in an orthotopic tumor model, in which
LN229 cells were transplanted intracranially in nude
mice. The mean survival time in the control and ART
group was 37 and 40 days, respectively. Repeated low
dose TMZ treatment enhanced the mean survival period
to 169 days while concomitant TMZ and ART treatment
resulted in a clearly extended mean survival period of
242 days. The treatments with TMZ and ART over a
long period were well tolerated as revealed by the body
weight of mice (Supplementary Figure S1).The data
obtained with the glioblastoma xenograft model support
the notion that TMZ followed by ART or administrated
in combination with ART ameliorates the curative
effect of TMZ.

ART enhances the therapeutic effect of TMZ
Having shown that ART enhances the killing effect
of TMZ in vitro, we studied whether ART has an impact
on tumor growth following TMZ in a mouse model. We
used the line U87MGΔ because of a reasonable take
on rate if transplanted subcutaneously into nude mice.
Upon appearance of tumors, mice were treated with a

DISCUSSION

killing effects in LN229 glioblastoma cells, which
was preceded by a continuous wave of ROS and DSB
formation [18]. Since TMZ also produces DSB following
processing of O6-MeG/T mispairs by the mismatch repair
machinery [9], we hypothesized that the killing effect of
TMZ could be ameliorated by concomitant ART treatment.
Here we show for glioblastoma and glioblastoma
stem-like cells that ART post-treatment enhances the
killing effect of TMZ. This was shown for reproductive
cell death and the end-points apoptosis and necrosis. TMZ
induces mostly apoptosis in glioblastoma cells [26, 32],
which is a late response [26], and this response was
enhanced when ART was administered up to 72 h after
TMZ application. Simultaneous treatment with TMZ and
ART was ineffective in our in vitro setting, especially
if high doses of ART (> 30 µg/ml; > 40 µM) were used
(data not shown). This is presumably due to the
proliferation-inhibiting effect of ART, which is obvious at
toxic doses and interferes with the processing of TMZinduced O6-MeG lesions that needs replication, which is
mandatory for TMZ-induced apoptosis [26].
It is also important to note that TMZ was used at a
moderate dose not exceeding 50 µM. For comparison, the
typical plasma level of TMZ achieved in cancer therapy

ART, a semi-synthetic derivative of the active
ingredient of extracts of Artemisia annua L., which are
used for centuries in TCM for the treatment of various
inflammation-associated diseases [16], has come to
attention in conventional medicine because of its antibiotic
effect on plasmodia [28]. This made it a first-line drug
for the therapy of malaria, since plasmodia developed
resistance to conventional drugs such as chloroquine. The
mechanism of death of plasmodia is thought to result from
iron-stimulated ROS production by ART in plasmodia
host cells, the erythrocytes, and it has been concluded
that membrane damage kills the microorganism in the
host cells [29, 30]. Later on it has been shown that ART is
also able to kill mammalian cells, including cancer cells
[31]. The mechanism of cancer cell death has been studied
extensively and it has been shown that ART generates
ROS, which attacks DNA resulting in oxidative DNA
damage that finally leads to DSB formation and induction
of apoptotic and necrotic cell death [17, 18]. Since cells
defective in DSB repair are hypersensitive to ART, it was
concluded that in mammalian cells DSB are the trigger
for ART-induced cell death [17]. ART exerts remarkable

is 15–30 µM [33–35]. As noted above, the concentration
of ART used in our co-treatment experiments was also
low (< 30 µg/ml, i.e. < 40 µM. This low dose level did
not induce significant DSB and apoptosis/necrosis when
administered as single compound. For comparison, the
plasma ART level in malaria therapy is in the range of
0.4–0.6 µg/ml (corresponding to 1–1.5 µM) when the drug
is administered as infusion with 1–8 mg/kg body weight of
the patient [36, 37]. Thus, for concomitant administration
of TMZ with ART in glioma therapy higher ART doses are
presumably required, which may still be tolerated [38].
Interestingly, in the low ART dose range used we
did not observe an increase in DNA damage following
TMZ/ ART, compared to TMZ single treatment. Thus,
the amount of DSB, quantified as γH2AX foci, remained

the same. This is likely due to the low concentration of
ART we have chosen in the combined experimental
setting. Since the dose of ART applied in the combined
treatments was below the effective level of DSB
formation, we hypothesized another other mechanisms
being involved in TMZ sensitization. Previously we
have shown that apoptosis induced by TMZ is preceded
by autophagy, which is triggered by the same critical
DNA damage that induces apoptosis, namely O6-MeG
[11]. Since inhibition of O6-MeG-triggered autophagy
in an experimental setting enhanced the killing effect
of TMZ, it was conceivable that ART has an impact on
TMZ-induced autophagy, thus blocking a pro-survival
mechanism. This supposition prompted us to study the
autophagy response of glioblastoma cells following TMZ

and ART treatment. We observed that TMZ treatment
induces autophagy, confirming previous data. However,
the autophagy level was not altered by ART, showing that
ART in the dose range used does not inhibit the autophagy
process triggered by TMZ. We should note that ART

was previously shown to have the potential of inhibiting
autophagy [19], which was however not assessed in the
context of TMZ and low doses of ART.
Previously, we also showed that the O6-MeG lesion
activates senescence, which is like autophagy a survival

mechanism [11]. Here we confirm that TMZ induces
senescence in glioblastoma cells. Strikingly, the induction
of senescence was significantly reduced when ART
was administered after TMZ application. Therefore, we
conclude that ART-induced abrogation of TMZ-induced
senescence is causally involved in enhancing the killing
effect of TMZ. The mechanism of senescence triggered by
TMZ is not entirely known and, likewise, the mechanism
of ART that attenuates senescence induction. For UV
irradiation it was shown that concomitant activation
of p53 and AKT can trigger cellular senescence [39].
Since the AKT pathway is inhibited by ART [40, 41], the
ART provoked inhibition of TMZ-induced senescence
(as observed in our experiments) might be caused by
inactivation of players involved in the AKT pathway.
Clearly more molecular studies using the combined
treatment setting are required to solve this intriguing
question.
The critical TMZ-induced DNA lesion triggering
cell death in a clinically relevant dose range is O6-MeG.
This damage causes mispairings with thymine, which are
processed by mismatch repair, resulting in replication
blocking secondary lesions, very likely extended DNA
gaps [42] and DSB in the second post-treatment replication
cycle [7]. These secondary replication blocking lesions
are processed or tolerated by HR [43], which has a strong
impact on the survival of cells following DNA methylation
[24]. One of the key players of HR is Rad51, whose
downregulation significantly sensitized glioblastoma
cells to TMZ [25]. This background data prompted us to
address the question whether ART impacts the process of
HR following TMZ treatment. Here we show that ART
downregulates the level of Rad51 protein, as shown by
western blot experiments, and the HR frequency, using

a functional assay. We therefore conclude that Rad51
downregulation together with inhibition of replicative
senescence contributes to the enhancing effect of ART
on TMZ-induced cell death. The data are in line with a
recent study showing that ART causes a reduction in the
Rad51 level in ovarian cancer cells thus sensitizing them
to cisplatin [44].
In the mouse xenograft experiments we observed a
reduction in tumor growth when mice were treated with
a single dose of TMZ followed by repeated treatments
with ART. Some tumors completely disappeared and
others melted down to a scar tissue. Additionally, repeated
treatment with TMZ in combination with ART led to
an increased survival in a mouse brain tumor model.
Therefore, it is likely that repeated treatments with TMZ
together with ART are superior to single TMZ treatment,
as it was applied in the experimental in vitro setting shown
here. Of note, in the clinical setting patients receive TMZ
daily (serum half-life ~2 h) [34], i.e. they are chronically
and pulsatile exposed to the alkylating agent, which is well
tolerable even after long-term treatment [45]. If chronic
TMZ exposure would occur together with ART, the
processes we have studied in vitro are expected to go on
repeatedly in the cancer cells in vivo, which might strongly
enhance the effectiveness of treatment. Importantly, the
side effects of combined treatment on tumor bearing mice
were negligible and, overall, the continuous treatment with
ART was well tolerated.
ART and its metabolies such as dihydroartemisinin
have been studied previously in several co-treatment
settings in vitro showing an ameliorating effects on the
cytotoxicity of carboplatin in ovarian cancer cells [46],
doxorubicin in leukemic T cells [47], gemcitabine in
hepatoma cells [48], cyclophosphamide in lung cancer cells

[49], and ionising radiation in lymphoma cells [50, 51].
For TMZ it was shown that ART enhances the killing
response of rat C6 glioma cells [52], Here, we extend
these studies and report that combined treatment of
human glioblastoma cells with TMZ and low dose of
ART is superior over single treatments, enhancing killing
of glioblastoma and glioblastoma stem-like cells in vitro
and in a xenograft mouse model. In conclusion, sequential
treatment with TMZ and ART appears to be a reasonable
strategy for glioblastoma treatment, worth to be proven in
clinical trials.

dissolved in DMSO. All drugs were added to the cell
culture medium as single application and maintained
within the medium until the end of incubation time. ART
treatment was performed 72 h after TMZ application. To
inhibit MGMT activity in the G112SP line the cells were
pretreated with 10 µM O6-BG prior TMZ treatment. To
inhibit DNA-PK activity cells were incubated with 1 µM
KU-0060648 (Selleckchem) 1 h prior TMZ as well as ART
treatment. For in vivo use, TMZ was dissolved in 16.7%
DMSO/0.9% NaCl (subcutaneous transplantation) and
1.4% DMSO/0.9% NaCl (intracranial transplantation).
ART was dissolved in 1% ethanol (subcutaneous
transplantation) and 50 mM KH2PO4/5% saccharose
(intracranial transplantation).

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell lines and culture conditions

Determination of apoptosis and necrosis

LN229 and A172 glioblastoma cell lines were
provided by Dr. Weller (Department of Oncology,
University Hospital Zurich). The U87MG glioma cell
line was purchased from CLS Heidelberg and U87MGΔ
expressing the truncated form of the EGFR were a
kind gift of Dr. Cavenee, San Diego, USA [53]. Stable
transfected LN229 cells (the clone pSuper #2 for the
control vector and clone Rad51 sh #23) were generated in
this laboratory as previously described [25]. All cell lines
were maintained in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium
(DMEM) with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) at 37°C
and 5% CO2 atmosphere. The transfected LN229 cells
were selected with 0.75 mg/ml G418 (Millipore). Glioma
stem-like cells G112SP were isolated from the human
glioma cell line G112 [54] by selecting cell populations
capable of continuous propagation in serum-free medium.
G112SP cells possess stemness attributes including the
propensity for self-renewal, phenotypic plasticity and
the ability to generate clonal gliomaspheres in vitro.
They are highly tumorigenic and recapitulate distinct
properties of GBM such as invasive tumour growth,
intratumoural heterogeneity and radiation resistance
[55]. The G112SP cells were grown under serum-free
condition in Neurobasal-A medium (Life Technologies)
containing B-27 supplement (Life Technologies), 20 ng/ml
EGF (Biochrom), 10 ng/ml FGF-basic (Biochrom) and
0.1% bovine serum albumin (BSA). Cells were checked
for mycoplasma contamination before experimental use,
cultured for a maximum period of 12 weeks and then
replaced.

The frequency of apoptosis and necrosis was
determined by annexin V/propidium iodide (PI) double
staining and quantified by flow cytometry with FACS
Canto II (Beckton Dickinson) as previously described [56].

Determination of ROS formation
ROS formation was measured using H2DCFDA
(Invitrogen). After pretreatment with 4 µmol H2DCFDA in
serum-free and pH indicator-free medium for 30 min, cells
were treated with NST-1 and ART at the indicated time
points. After incubation cells were washed twice with PBS
and analyzed (FACSCalibur, Becton Dickinson). Relative
ROS level was determined by comparing the fluorescence
intensity of treated with untreated cells.

Clonogenic survival
In colony formation assays glioblastoma cells
LN229, A172 and U87MG were seeded at a density of
250 cells/ml. They were allowed to attach and 24 h later
treated with TMZ and/or ART. After 11–14 days, the
colonies were fixed with 100% methanol for 20 min, stained
with crystal-violet (1 g/l dH2O) for 30 min and colonies
containing at least 40 cells were counted and presented
graphically as a percentage of untreated cells (control). The
experiments were repeated at least three times.

Immunofluorescence
Cells were seeded on cover slips. After
treatment with TMZ and ART the cells were fixed
with 4% formaldehyde for 15 min, washed with PBS,
permeabilized in ice-cold methanol for 10 min, rehydrated
in PBS and blocked with 10% normal goat serum and
0.25% Triton-X100 for 1 h. Cover slips were incubated
overnight with a γH2AX-antibody (Millipore), washed
with PBS and incubated with Alexa Fluor 488 anti-mouse
secondary antibody (Invitrogen) for 1 h. Cover slips were

Drugs and drug treatment
For in vitro application TMZ (gift from ScheringPlough) was dissolved in 30.9% dimethyl sulfoxide
(DMSO). ART (kindly provided by Dr. Jansen, Dafra
Pharma International) was dissolved in 2% DMSO/
phosphate buffered saline (PBS). Necrostatin-1 (NST-1,
Enzo Life Science) was dissolved in 0.02% DMSO/
PBS. O6-benzylguanine (O6-BG, Sigma-Aldrich) was

(Bioimaging Center, University Konstanz) for automatic
foci quantification.

using FACSCanto II (Becton Dickinson) as discussed
previously [11]. Relative autophagy level was normalized
to untreated control cells.

Determination of senescence
Replicative senescence was determined as described
previously [27]. Briefly, cells were preincubated with
100 mM bafilomycin A1 (Sigma) for 1 h, then stained with
33 µM C12FDG (Invitrogen) in medium for 60 min before
harvest. At the end of experiment (144 h following TMZ
treatment), cells were trypsinized and washed in cold
PBS. Flow cytometry of the cell suspension in PBS was
performed at FACSCanto II (Becton Dickinson). Relative
senescence level was normalized to untreated control cells.
In addition to FACS measurement, senescence-associated
beta-galactosidase (SA-β-gal) activity was detected
cytochemically via Senescence β-Galactosidase Staining
Kit (CST) according to the manufacturer´s protocol.
Treated glioblastoma cells and stem-like G112SP cells
were fixed and stained for 16 h for ß-galactosidase.

Protein extract preparation and western blot
analysis
Whole protein extracts were prepared from LN229,
A172, U87MG and G112SP cells not treated and treated
as described. Cells were trypsinized and washed with
PBS, then lysed, sonified and boiled in Laemmli sample
buffer (60 mM Tris-Cl (pH 6.8), 2% SDS, 10% glycerol,
5% β-mercaptoethanol, 0.01% bromophenol blue)
at 95°C for 5 min. Cell extract was separated on a 12%
SDS polyacrylamide gel at 100V and blotted onto a
nitrocellulose membrane for 90 min at 300 mA using
buffer composed of 25 mmol/ L Tris-HCl, 86 mmol/ L
glycin and 20% methanol. Anti-Rad51 (Abcam) and Antiβ-Actin (Santa Cruz) were used for immunodetection. The
induction factor (IF) of Rad51 referred to β-actin (loading
control) and the non-treated control was set to 1.

Xenograft mouse experiments and intracranial
model
For tumorigenesis experiments, we used U87MGΔ
cells [53] for subcutaneous implantation. 5 × 106 cells
diluted in 100 µl PBS were injected subcutaneously in
the dorsal flanks of BALB/c nude mice (Charles River).
After mice developed palpable tumors, a single TMZ dose
of 200 mg/kg body weight was injected intraperitoneally.
One day after TMZ treatment, ART (1 mg/ml) was given
continuously in drinking water supplemented with 2%
saccharose. The tumor volume was calculated according
to the formula TV = L × W2/2 (TV tumor volume;
L length; W width). At least 5 animals were used per
treatment group. The intracranial model was performed
with LN229 cells. 1 × 105 cells in 2 µl PBS were injected
into the brain of NMRI nu/nu mice (Charles River). Three
weeks after implantation, tumors developed as verified
by MRT. At this point low dose TMZ was administered
intraperitoneally (5 mg/kg body weight) five times a week
for the duration of six weeks. In parallel ART (100 mg/ kg
bodyweight) was applied orally five times a week for the
duration of nine weeks and afterwards three times a week.
Survival of mice was determined over a time of 329 days.
Per treatment group at least 7 animals were included.
All animal procedures were carried out according to the
guidelines of the German regulations for animal welfare.
Protocols were approved by the local ethic commission.

Homologous recombination activity assay
To measure the capacity of cells to repair DSB by
HR, LN229 cells were stably transfected with a pDRGFP
plasmid (Addgene). The plasmid bears two non-functional
GFP genes. One truncated, the other containing a
recognition site for I-SceI endonuclease. Upon transient
transfection with I-SceI expressing plasmid (Addgene),
the endonuclease cleaves the modified GFP gene leading
to a DSB. If this DSB is getting repaired by HR, using
the sequence of the truncated GFP gene, a functional
GFP protein is generated, which can be quantified by flow
cytometry. Cells were analyzed 72 h after transfection
with 1 μg pCβASceI using the transfection kit Effectene
(Quiagen). During transfection, the cells were incubated
in the presence of ART (24 h, 48 h, 72 h). The DNAPK inhibitor KU0060648 (Selleckchem) was used for
comparison at a final concentration of 1 μM. We expected
that the inhibition of DNA-PK leads to a moderate
increase in HR activity due to the lack of competition by
NHEJ for the repair of DSB (Shrivastav, 2008). Cells were
trypsinized and washed with PBS and measured by flow
cytometry using FACS Canto II (BD Biosciences). Data
were analysed with BD FACSDiva™ software.
