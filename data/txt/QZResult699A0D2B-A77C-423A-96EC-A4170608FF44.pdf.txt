Abstract
Testicular germ cell tumors (TGCT) are the most common solid
tumors of 15- to 35-year-old men. TGCT patients are frequently
cured with cytotoxic cisplatin-based therapy. However, TGCT
patients refractory to cisplatin-based chemotherapy have a
poor prognosis, as do those having a late relapse. Pluripotent
embryonal carcinomas (EC) are the malignant counterparts to
embryonic stem cells and are considered the stem cells of
TGCTs. Here, we show that human EC cells are highly sensitive
to 5-aza-deoxycytidine (5-aza-CdR) compared with somatic
solid tumor cells. Decreased proliferation and survival with
low nanomolar concentrations of 5-aza-CdR is associated
with ATM activation, H2AX phosphorylation, increased expression of p21, and the induction of genes known to be methylated
in TGCTs (MGMT, RASSF1A, and HOXA9). Notably, 5-aza-CdR
hypersensitivity is associated with markedly abundant expression of the pluripotency-associated DNA methyltransferase
3B (DNMT3B) compared with somatic tumor cells. Knockdown of DNMT3B in EC cells results in substantial resistance
to 5-aza-CdR, strongly indicating that 5-aza-CdR sensitivity is
mechanistically linked to high levels of DNMT3B. Intriguingly,
cisplatin-resistant EC cells retain an exquisite sensitivity
to low-dose 5-aza-CdR treatment, and pretreatment of 5-azaCdR resensitizes these cells to cisplatin-mediated toxicity. This
resensitization is also partially dependent on high DNMT3B
levels. These novel findings indicate that high expression of
DNMT3B, a likely byproduct of their pluripotency and germ cell
origin, sensitizes TGCT-derived EC cells to low-dose 5-aza-CdR
treatment. [Cancer Res 2009;69(24):9360–6]

Patients with TGCTs, even those with advanced metastatic disease, are often successfully treated with cisplatin-based chemotherapeutic regimens (3, 4). However, 15% to 20% of patients are
refractory to this treatment and succumb to progressive disease (5).
Some TGCT patients, who initially respond to treatment, can exhibit
a late relapse and have a poor prognosis (4, 5). Testicular cancer survivors have increased incidence of infertility, cardiovascular disease,
and secondary malignancies (6).
Reasons for the high curability of TGCTs have been elusive.
Mouse models of testicular cancer do exist, but they do no recapitulate key features of this human malignancy (1). Mechanisms of
inherent or acquired cisplatin resistance in other tumors have
not yet provided insights into the exquisite cisplatin sensitivity
of TGCTs (4). That patients with advanced stage TGCTs can be
cured implies that the stem cells of TGCTs are effectively targeted
with cisplatin-based chemotherapy (1, 4).
To date, DNA methylation inhibitors have been more active in
leukemia than in solid tumor cells (7). There is currently little
information available on the effects of DNA methylation inhibitors against TGCT cells. In the current study, we establish that
TGCT cells are hypersensitive to the DNA methylation inhibitor
5-aza-deoxycytidine (5-aza-CdR). This response is associated
with remarkably high levels of DNA methyltransferase 3B
(DNMT3B). Notably, high DNMT3B expression is validated as
functionally important for 5-aza-CdR–mediated hypersensitivity
in both cisplatin-sensitive and cisplatin-resistant TGCT cells. Indeed, 5-aza-CdR can resensitize cisplatin-resistant cells to cisplatinmediated toxicity. Together, these findings indicate that high basal
DNMT3B expression in pluripotent EC cells can account for 5-aza-CdR
hypersensitivity in cisplatin-sensitive and cisplatin-resistant TGCTs.

Introduction
Testicular germ cell tumors (TGCT), the most common solid tumors of adolescent and young men, are thought to derive from
transformation of primordial germ cells (PGC) or early gonocytes
(1, 2). TGCTs are classified as seminomas and nonseminomas (1).
Within nonseminomas are undifferentiated, pluripotent cells,
known as embryonal carcinoma (EC). ECs are proposed to represent the stem cells of TGCTs and to be the malignant counterparts
to embryonic stem (ES) cells (1, 2). EC cells can differentiate in vivo
as mature teratomas toward extraembryonic tissues and embryonic
tissues (1, 2).

Materials and Methods
Cell culture and drug treatments. All cell lines were cultured in
DMEM media with 10% fetal bovine serum supplemented with glutamine
and antibiotics with the exception of MCF7 cells that were cultured in F12DMEM. The derivation of the NT2/D1-resistant NT2/D1-R1 cell line was
previously described (8, 9). With the exception of results in Fig. 4D, cells
were treated with the indicated dosages of 5-aza-CdR for 3 d and drug
was replenished each day. For the experiment in Fig. 4D, 3 × 103 cells were
plated per well in 24-well plates. The next day, cells were treated with the
indicated doses of 5-aza-CdR daily for 3 d and then treated with the indicated doses of 5-aza-CdR every other day for an additional 7 d. Cells were
then fixed and stained with Geimsa stain. Cisplatin (Bristol Laboratories)
treatments were performed at the concentrations and time points indicated. To assess cell proliferation and survival, Cell-Titre Glo (Promega) assays
were performed.
Real-time PCR and immunoblot analyses. Reverse transcription was
performed on 1 μg RNA using the Taqman RT kit (Applied Biosystems).
Twenty nanograms of the resulting cDNA was used with SYBR green (Applied Biosystems) for quantitative real-time PCR assays using the ddCT

Results

Figure 1. EC cell lines are sensitive to low-dose 5-aza-CdR. Indicated doses
of 5-aza-CdR were added fresh each day for 3 d to exponentially growing
cultures. Viable cell growth and survival were measured. Data were normalized
to no drug treatment. EC cells are NT2/D1, NT2D1/R1, 833K, 833K-CP, and
Tera-1. Data are the average of three biological replicates. Each line was
assayed in at least two independent experiments with similar results. Points,

method normalized to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase and the
ABI Prism Sequence Detection System 7700. Primers are provided in Supplementary Table S1. For Western analyses, cells were lysed in a radioimmune precipitation buffer and separated by SDS-PAGE, as previously
described (8, 9). Antibodies to DNMT3B (H-230; sc-20704, Santa Cruz,
and Ab2851, Abcam), actin (C-11; sc01615, Santa Cruz), 1981-ATM (Epitomics), and 139-H2AX (Cell Signaling) were used.
Lentiviral production. Silencing shRNAs targeting human DNMT3B
were purchased (Open Biosystems). A pLKO.1-shRNA lentiviral construct
was also purchased (pLKO.1, Sigma) and used as a control. Lentiviral stocks
were generated from 293T cells, and psPAX2 and pMD2G packaging and
envelop vectors using standard protocols. Viral stocks were independently
added to NT2/D1 and NT2/D1-R1 cells plated at 0.2 × 106 cells per well per
six-well plates. The lentiviral stock was cultured with each of these cells for
24 h. Cells were then harvested and placed onto 10-cm plates in selection
media containing 1.0 μg/mL puromycin. Selection continued for 48 h, after
which no viable cells remained in the mock-transduced control plates. The
puromycin-resistant cell pools were passaged for at least 10 d before use in
these experiments.

EC sensitivity to low-dose 5-aza-CdR. We sought to identify
whether different EC cell lines were sensitive to DNA methylation
inhibition. Five different EC cell lines, including two that were cisplatin resistant, NT2/D1-R1 and 833K-CP, compared with parental
NT2/D1 and 833K lines, were highly sensitive to inhibition of cell
growth and viability with the DNA methylation inhibitor 5-aza-CdR
with IC50s in the 5 to 25 nmol/L range (Fig. 1). These doses are
substantially lower than those typically reported for diverse solid
somatic tumors that have IC50s in the 500 nmol/L to 10 μmol/L
range (7, 10). This is in agreement with our somatic tumor cell data
as human breast (MCF7), osteosarcoma (U2OS), and colon
(HCT116) cancer cells were relatively resistant to 5-aza-CdR treatment at doses as high as 5 μmol/L (Fig. 1). Interestingly, the line
most sensitive to 5-aza-CdR was the cisplatin-resistant line, 833K-CP
(also called 833K64-CP10).
EC cells overexpress DNMT3B compared with somatic
cancer cells. Recent microarray studies indicated that ES and
EC cells as well as clinical EC and nonseminomas highly express
mRNA for the DNA methyltransferase, DNMT3B, compared with
normal and somatic tumors (11–13). However, this differential
expression has not been confirmed or shown at the protein level.
We found a striking difference in DNMT3B protein expression in
the EC cell lines NT2/D1, NT2/D1-R1, 833K, 833K-CP, Tera-1,
577M, and 2102EP compared with U2OS, MCF7, and lung, pancreatic and glioblastoma cancer cell lines (Fig. 2). HCT116 cells
also did not express appreciable DNMT3B compared with EC
cells (data not shown). Notably, the high expression of DNMT3B
in EC cells could be detected with two distinct DNMT3B antibodies (Fig. 2). Densitometry measurements revealed at least a 30fold increase in DNMT3B expression in the EC cells compared
with somatic tumor cells. Thus, the hypersensitivity of TGCTs to
low-dose 5-aza-CdR is tightly associated with high expression of
DNMT3B in EC cells. It should be noted that there is not an exact
correlation between the EC cell lines with regard to the level of
DNMT3B and sensitivity to 5-aza-CdR. This is most evident in the
NT2/D1-R1 line that is less sensitive to 10 nmol/L 5-aza-CdR compared with other EC cells, yet is one of the highest expressers of
DNMT3B. Thus, there seems to be other cell line–specific factors,

lines. U87 and U251 are glioblastoma cell
lines and PANC1 is a pancreatic cancer

used in A, whereas DNMT3B antibody
ab2851 was used in B to D.

Figure 3. Low-dose 5-aza-CdR activates the ATM pathway and induces the
expression of methylated genes in EC cells. A, indicated doses of 5-aza were
added fresh each day for 3 d to NT2/D1-R1 cells. Expression profiles of P(S198)
ATM and P(S139)H2AX were assessed. The experiment was repeated with
similar results. B, NT2/D1-R1 cells were treated as in A above and expression of

other than DNMT3B, which affect the relative sensitivity of the EC
cells to 5-aza-CdR.
Low-dose 5-aza-CdR induces H2AX and ATM phosphorylation
and tumor suppressor gene expression. Two mechanisms have
been proposed to account for the antitumor effects of 5-aza-CdR,
namely, activation of the DNA damage response pathway and
re-expression of tumor suppressor genes through DNA demethylation (14–18). We asked whether 5-aza-CdR engaged
these mechanisms at the low doses affecting cell proliferation
and survival of EC. As shown in Fig. 3A, low-dose 5-aza-CdR treatment of NT2/D1-R1 cells increased the levels of activated ATM and
phosphorylated H2AX, two hallmarks of the DNA damage response
previously shown to be induced with high-dose 5-aza-CdR in somatic tumor cells (7, 17, 18).
To address whether low-dose 5-aza-CdR induced the expression
of genes known to be methylated in TGCTs, expression of MGMT,
RASSF1A, HOXA9, and BRCA1 (19–21) was assessed (Fig. 3B). Lowdose 5-aza-CdR induced the expression of MGMT, RASSF1A, and
HOXA9 in NT2/D1-R1 cells. In contrast, expression of BRCA1 was
not induced by low-dose 5-aza-CdR. Low-dose 5-aza-CdR was also
able to induce the expression of p21. The p21 gene is not known to
be commonly methylated in tumor cells but is commonly induced
in response to DNA damage (22). Together, the data suggest that
low doses of 5-aza-CdR can elicit both a DNA damage response
and the induction of genes known to be methylated in TGCTs.
Knockdown of DNMT3B in EC cells reverses 5-aza-CdR
hypersensitivity. Five different lentiviral shRNAs for DNMT3B
were independently used to knockdown DNMT3B. Six potential

alternatively spliced isoforms of DNMT3B exist; the most biologically relevant isoforms are variants 1, 2, 3, and 6 (14). Quantitative
reverse transcription-PCR assays using isoform-specific primers revealed that these shRNAs (relative to controls) reduced expression
of these DNMT3B isoforms (Fig. 4A). Furthermore, none of the
DNMT3B-specific shRNAs affected levels of DNMT1 or DNMT3A
(Fig. 4A). DNMT3B-targeting shRNAs also reduced DNMT3B protein in both NT2/D1 and NT2/D1-R1 cells (Fig. 4B). Because
NT2/D1 cells stably expressing sh84 and NT2/D1-R1 cells stably
expressing sh84, sh85, or sh86 had the most efficient knockdown
of DNMT3B (Fig. 4A and B), these cells were tested for 5-aza-CdR
sensitivity. Cells expressing DNMT3B-targeting shRNAs exhibited
dramatic reduction of 5-aza-CdR sensitivity compared with control cells (Fig. 4C). However, knockdown of DNMT3B by itself
had no apparent effect on the growth of NT2/D1 or NT2/D1-R1
cells (data not shown). These results strongly support a functional
link between sensitivity of EC cells to 5-aza-CdR and high DNMT3B
expression.
Chronic low-dose scheduling has been suggested to be the optimal protocol for 5-aza-CdR in the treatment of leukemia (15).
Therefore, the effect of DNMT3B expression on the sensitivity of
NT2/D1-R1 cells to chronic 5-aza-CdR treatment was assessed.
NT2/D1-R1 cells and control shRNA cells showed an even greater
sensitivity to a prolonged 10-day treatment with 5-aza-CdR compared with the 3-day treatment (Fig. 4D). These cells were sensitive
to 5-aza-CdR at doses as low as 2.5 nmol/L. In contrast, NT2/D1-R1
cells treated with DNMT3B-targeting shRNA showed a dramatic
resistance to 5-aza-CdR (Fig. 4D).
Restoring cisplatin sensitivity to resistant cells with 5-azaCdR. We previously reported that cisplatin causes a global p53dominant transcriptional response in EC cells (23). Through microarray
and other studies, we found that the p53 response is repressed in
NT2/D1-R1 cells despite having abundant wild-type p53 expression (data not shown; refs. 8, 9, 23). Figure 5A shows that pretreatment of NT2/D1-R1 cells with low-dose (10 nmol/L) 5-aza-CdR for
3 days at least partially restored cisplatin induction of the p53 target genes GDF15 and BTG2 in NT2/D1-R1 cells. Notably, 5-aza-CdR
treatment alone substantially induced the expression of GDF15, BTG2,
and the p53 target gene, FDXR, in these cells. In contrast, 5-aza-CdR
treatment had little or no detected effect on cisplatin induction of
FDXR in NT2/D1-R1 cells. This dose of 5-aza-CdR inhibits proliferation of NT2/D1-R1 cells by only ∼10% versus controls after
3 days (Fig. 1). Viable cells were counted and replated after
5-aza-CdR treatment and allowed to recover for 24 hours before cisplatin treatment. Notably, pretreatment with low-dose
5-aza-CdR restored cisplatin growth suppression and toxicity to
two separate cisplatin-resistant TGCT cell lines, NT2/D1-R1 and
833K-CP (Fig. 5B and C). 833K-CP cells were pretreated with
2.5 nmol/L 5-aza-CdR, a dose that results in a 10% growth inhibition (Fig. 1). Pretreatment with 5-aza-CdR did not alter the cisplatin sensitivity of parental NT2/D1 cells, but did partially
increase the cisplatin sensitivity of 833K cells (data not shown).
These data indicated that 5-aza-CdR can restore cisplatin cytotoxic
response to cisplatin-resistant EC cells.
Relationship between DNMT3B levels and cisplatin sensitivity.
Because DNMT3B knockdown reversed 5-aza-CdR hypersensitivity in cisplatin-sensitive and cisplatin-resistant EC cells, it was of
interest to investigate whether cisplatin sensitivity itself depended
on DNMT3B expression. As shown in Fig. 6, DNMT3B knockdown
had no appreciable effect on cisplatin sensitivity of the cisplatinresistant EC line NT2/D1-R1. This is in agreement with the finding

that both cisplatin-sensitive (NT2/D1 and 833K) and cisplatinresistant (NT2/D1-R1 and 833K-CP) EC cells abundantly express
DNMT3B (Fig. 2). However, the ability of 5-aza-CdR to sensitize
NT2/D1-R1 cells to cisplatin was substantially and significantly
repressed by DNMT3B depletion. In summary, these data indicate that 5-aza-CdR hypersensitivity of EC cells is dependent on
DNMT3B expression regardless of whether the cells are sensitive
or resistant to cisplatin. Yet, cisplatin sensitivity per se is not affected
by DNMT3B expression.

Discussion
Few studies have addressed 5-aza cytidine analogue treatment
effects in TGCT cells. In the current study, we show that TGCT
cells are hypersensitive to the DNA methylation inhibitor, 5-azaCdR. This response is tightly associated with high levels of
DNMT3B protein, which was validated as an important target of
5-aza-CdR–mediated hypersensitivity in cisplatin-sensitive as well
as cisplatin-resistant TGCTs. Based on these findings, we propose
that TGCT cells may be distinctly sensitive to DNA methylation

inhibitors due to high basal levels of DNMT3B that are likely a consequence of the PGC origins of EC and their similarities to ES cells,
which also are known to express high levels of DNMT3B (11, 12).
Indeed, several genomic studies highlighted DNMT3B as a marker
of pluripotency (11, 12).
The 5-aza cytidine–related compounds become incorporated
into DNA and have been shown to mediate covalent adduct formation with DNMTs (16). The most widely studied and accepted
mechanism for the antitumor effects of 5-aza-CdR is related to
DNA demethylation and re-expression of specific tumor suppressor genes (reviewed in ref. 14). However, other studies indicate
that DNA methylation–independent effects of 5-aza-CdR are critical, especially for effects mediated through the ATM/ATR/p53dependent DNA damage checkpoint (7, 16–18, 24, 25). The degree
each mechanism is used may be cell context–dependent. The
studies cited above use doses of 5-aza considerably higher than
the doses used here in the treatment of EC cells. We provide evidence that in EC cells, low-dose 5-aza-CdR is able to activate the
ATM pathway as well as induce the expression of genes known to
be methylated in TGCTs (Fig. 3).

every other day thereafter. This experiment was repeated with similar results (data not shown).

At first glance, it may seem paradoxical that EC cells are hypersensitive to a DNA methylation inhibitor, but are resistant to that
inhibitor when one of its targets, DNMT3B, is depleted (Fig. 4).
This result argues that the actions of 5-aza-CdR in EC cells cannot
be explained fully by inhibition of DNMT3B activity and suggests
that high basal levels of DNMT3B are needed to efficiently elicit an
acute cytotoxic response to 5-aza-CdR.

This finding is not without precedence. Juttermann and colleagues (16) showed that ES cells and embryos with DNMT1 knockdown were significantly less sensitive to 5-aza-CdR–mediated
toxicity. Oka and colleagues (26), using DNMT3B/DNMT3A null
ES cells, also showed that DNMT3B/DNMT3A knockdown results
in decreased sensitivity to 5-aza-CdR. HCT116 cells that contain a
hypomorphic, truncated allele of DNMT1 were shown to have less

H2AX phosphorylation and ATM activation in response to 5-aza-CdR,
compared with wild-type HCT116 cells (17). However, cells with the
hypomorphic DNMT1 allele were sensitized to 5-aza-CdR cytotoxicity, presumably due to a failure to effectively arrest in G2-M
(17). In contrast, our preliminary data have thus far not detected
large differences in 5-aza-CdR–mediated ATM and H2AX activation in DNMT3B knockdown cells, compared with wild-type EC
cells (data not shown). As DNMTs are auxiliary components of
the DNA replication and repair machinery (17, 27), it is possible
that depleting DNMT3B in the EC context alters downstream responses to 5-aza-CdR–mediated DNA damage that perturbs the balance between cell cycle checkpoint arrest, DNA repair, and apoptosis.
In contrast to 5-aza-CdR sensitivity, cisplatin sensitivity is independent of DNMT3B levels, as both cisplatin-sensitive and cisplatinresistant cells express abundant DNMT3B (Fig. 2) and knockdown of
DNMT3B fails to alter the cisplatin response (Fig. 6). Thus the cytotoxic effects of DNMT3B appear not to be engaged by general DNAdamaging agents. Rather, it is the combination of 5-aza-CdR and

high DNMT3B levels that seems critical for the hypersensitivity of
EC cells to 5-aza-CdR.
The methylation status of germ cell tumors has only recently
been investigated on a genome-wide level, and findings suggest
that TGCTs have distinct methylation signatures compared with
other solid tumors (19, 28). Seminomas are prominently hypothmethylated compared with nonseminomas and somatic tumors (19, 28). This
signature is likely related to the PGC origins of TGCTs. Male PGCs can
undergo complete erasure and re-establishment of DNA methylation
during development that is associated with dynamic changes in
the expression of the de novo DNA methyltransferase, DNMT3B (29).
5-Aza-CdR is Food and Drug Administration approved for the
treatment of myelodysplastic syndrome and shows promise for
the treatment of certain leukemias. Recent data suggest that
5-aza-CdR is most efficacious when given chronically and at
low dosages (15). It has been suggested that less compelling results with 5-aza-CdR in solid tumor trials may have been due in
part to the high doses administered and to the monitoring of
early rather than later clinical treatment responses (15). Based
on these arguments, a call to revisit 5-aza-CdR in solid tumors
as a single or combined agent has been made (15). In agreement
with our data, it has been shown that 5-aza-CdR can sensitize
somatic tumor cells to cisplatin, but at dosages considerably
higher than that shown here for EC cells (30–33).
A number of experimental antitumor drugs were propelled to be
successfully tested for treating other solid cancers based primarily
on initial studies conducted in testicular cancer (3). We propose
that high expression of DNMT3B in EC cells is a consequence of
their pluripotent and germ cell origin, and results in hypersensitivity
to DNA methylation inhibitors. The finding that cisplatin-resistant
EC cells retain a high degree of sensitivity to low-dose 5-aza-CdR and
that pretreatment of 5-aza-CdR restores cisplatin cytotoxicity to
resistant EC cells is notable because it can be clinically exploited.
