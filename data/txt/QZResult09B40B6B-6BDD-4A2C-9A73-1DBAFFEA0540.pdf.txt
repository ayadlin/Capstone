BACKGROUND: Ibrutinib is active in patients with relapsed/refractory (R/R) chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). In patients treated
with ibrutinib for R/R CLL, del(17p), identified by interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), is associated with inferior
progression-free survival despite equivalent initial response rates. Del(17p) is frequently associated with a complex metaphase karyotype (CKT); the prognostic significance of CKT in ibrutinib-treated patients has not been reported. METHODS: This study reviewed 88
patients treated for R/R CLL at The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center with investigational ibrutinib-based regimens
from 2010 to 2013. Pretreatment FISH and lipopolysaccharide-stimulated metaphase cytogenetic analysis were performed on bone
marrow. RESULTS: An adequate pretreatment metaphase karyotype was available for 56 of the 88 patients. The karyotype was complex in 21 of the 56 cases; 17 of the 21 had del(17p) according to FISH. The overall response rate, including partial remission with persistent lymphocytosis, was 94%; 18% had complete responses. In a multivariate analysis (MVA), only CKT was significantly associated
with event-free survival (EFS; hazard ratio [HR], 6.6 [95% CI 1.7-25.6]; P 5.006). Fludarabine-refractory CLL (HR, 6.9 [95% CI 1.8-27.1],
P 5.005) and CKT (HR 5.9 [95% CI 1.6-22.2], P 5.008) were independently associated with inferior overall survival (OS) in MVA.
Del(17p) by FISH was not significantly associated with EFS or OS in MVA. CONCLUSIONS: CKT is a powerful predictor of outcomes
for ibrutinib-treated patients with R/R CLL and may be a stronger predictor of biological behavior than del(17p) by FISH. Because of
their relatively poor outcomes, patients with CKT are ideal candidates for studies of consolidative treatment strategies or novel treatC 2015 American Cancer Society.

INTRODUCTION
Patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) with del(17p) by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) have poor
outcomes when they are treated with chemotherapy or chemoimmunotherapy; the median survival in such patients is
approximately 2 years.1 Long-term survival can be achieved with allogeneic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT) in some
patients; with approximately 50% 5-year survival, patients with del(17p) have outcomes similar to those of patients without del(17p) after allo-SCT.2,3
The Bruton tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitor ibrutinib4 is active in relapsed/refractory (R/R) CLL with a
progression-free survival (PFS) of approximately 75% at 26 months.4 Patients with del(17p) have PFS inferior to that of
patients without del(17p),4 with a median PFS of approximately 28 months.5 Ibrutinib resistance has been associated in
some cases with the development of specific mutations in the B-cell receptor signaling pathway, most commonly the
C481S mutation in BTK, which prevents irreversible binding of ibrutinib to BTK. Patients with del(17p) and/or a complex metaphase karyotype (CKT) may be more likely to develop these mutations.6 The optimal treatment for patients

refractory to ibrutinib is not established; the response to
subsequent salvage treatment is poor, and survival is
short.7 The availability of B cell receptor signaling inhibitors has made the decision of whether to proceed with
allo-SCT in high-risk patients more complex; there is no
consensus regarding which patients with del(17p) should
proceed to allo-SCT or regarding the optimal timing of
allo-SCT.
Del(17p) CLL is frequently associated with CKT,
which is defined as 3 or more distinct chromosomal
abnormalities present in more than 1 metaphase.8 CKT
has been associated with inferior outcomes for both
treatment-naive patients9,10 and R/R CLL patients undergoing therapy,11 including allo-SCT12; the prognostic
significance of CKT in ibrutinib-treated patients is
unknown. Obtaining metaphases for cytogenetic analysis
has traditionally been challenging in CLL because of the
low ex vivo mitotic rate of CLL cells. Frequently, no
abnormalities are detected because only normal hematopoietic cells divide ex vivo or only poor-quality metaphases
are obtained.10,13 Array comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) or FISH does not require cell division14 and
may detect abnormalities when no abnormal metaphases
are obtained by conventional techniques. However, they
provide limited information; array CGH detects genomic
imbalances only and provides no information about balanced translocations or the mechanism of gain or loss;
FISH provides information only about chromosomes specifically targeted by the probes used.8 Mitogens such as
combined immunostimulatory CpG oligonucleotides
and interleukin 2 can be used to stimulate ex vivo growth
of CLL cells; this substantially increases the yield of analyzable metaphases and increases the proportion of cases
in which cytogenetic abnormities are detected by conventional cytogenetic analysis to >80%.15 More than 20% of
patients analyzed in this way will have CKT, whereas
<1% will be detected by FISH alone.15
We analyzed long-term follow-up data for 88
patients with R/R CLL treated with ibrutinib-based regimens to determine whether subgroups of patients with
del(17p) with differing outcomes could be identified and
to assess possible novel predictors of outcomes with a particular focus on the prognostic significance of CKT.
PATIENTS AND METHODS
We reviewed 88 patients treated for R/R CLL at The
University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center with
investigational ibrutinib-based regimens from 2010 to
2013. We were interested in patients with long-term
follow-up; therefore, only patients who had commenced
Cancer

October 15, 2015

treatment before June 2013 were included. Thirty-eight
patients received ibrutinib monotherapy at either 420
or 840 mg/d, 36 received ibrutinib plus rituximab, and
14 received ibrutinib plus bendamustine and rituximab.
Details of the combination regimens were presented previously.16,17 All patients provided informed consent, and
all studies were institutional review board–approved and
were conducted according to the Declaration of Helsinki.
Pretreatment FISH and lipopolysaccharide-stimulated
metaphase cytogenetic analysis18 were performed on bone
marrow, although the latter was not required per protocol.
Material was considered adequate for karyotypic analysis
if 10 or more metaphases were available in the presence of
clonal abnormalities or 15 or more were available in the
absence of clonal abnormalities.10 Clonal cytogenetic
abnormalities were considered to be present when at least
2 or more metaphases showed identical chromosome gain
or structural abnormalities or at least 3 metaphases
showed identical chromosome loss.19
Statistical analyses were performed with SPSS 22
(IBM Corp, Armonk, NY) and GraphPad Prism 6
(GraphPad Software, La Jolla, Calif). Descriptive statistics
were used to summarize patient characteristics. Dichotomous variables were compared with the chi-square test or
Fisher’s exact test. Univariate survival analyses were performed with the Kaplan-Meier method,20 and differences
between groups were assessed with the log-rank test.21
Multivariate analysis (MVA) for dichotomous variables
was performed with logistic regression. Multivariate survival analysis was performed with a Cox proportional hazards model.22 Variables with P values < .1 in univariate
analyses were included in the multivariate models, and
only cases with complete data for variables of interest were
included in the multivariate models. Event-free survival
(EFS) was defined as the time from the initiation of the
study drug to permanent cessation of the study drug for
any reason. Overall survival (OS) was defined as the time
from the initiation of the study drug to death. Patients
were censored at their last follow-up for EFS and survival
outcomes. The final censoring date was July 14, 2014.
EFS was chosen as an outcome measure rather than PFS
to capture potentially significant events that may be associated with the presence of CKT, including the development of second cancers requiring systemic therapy and
the decision to proceed to allo-SCT. Seven patients who
underwent allo-SCT during partial remission or complete
remission (CR) were censored for EFS analysis at the time
of transplantation, but they continued to be followed for
survival.

Relation Between Metaphase Karyotype
Analysis and Del(17p) by FISH

Metaphase karyotype analysis was attempted for 63
patients, and metaphases were adequate for analysis in 56.
The 7 cases for which metaphase analysis was attempted
but inadequate data were available had poor-quality metaphases or fewer than 10 metaphases generated. The relationship between FISH and metaphase karyotype results
is shown in Figure 1. Among 21 patients with CKT, 17
had del(17p) (odds ratio [OR] vs non-del(17p) patients,
22.7 [95% CI 5.2-99.6]; P < .001), 3 had del(11q), and 1
did not have FISH results available. There was no difference in the percentage of cells with a TP53 deletion by
FISH according to the presence or absence of CKT (median, 65% [95% CI 7.5%-86.0%] vs 37% [95% CI
12.0%-96.5%]; P 5 .32). The 7 patients with TP53 deletion by FISH but without CKT predominantly had a diploid karyotype (n 5 6), whereas 1 had add(17p).
There were 9 patients who had del(17p) detected by
FISH but no abnormalities involving chromosome 17p
noted by a concurrent metaphase cytogenetic evaluation.
The median percentage of TP53 deletion by FISH in
3614

these patients was 30%; the range was 7.5% to 82%. Six
of these 9 patients had diploid cytogenetics or noncomplex clonal abnormalities according to the metaphase
cytogenetic analysis. Two of these 6 cases had a very low
percentage of TP53 deletion by FISH (7.5% and 12%),
whereas the remaining 4 cases had 24% TP53 deletion
by FISH; 1 of these patients had a single metaphase with
complex cytogenetic abnormalities, including monosomy
17, and thus did not meet criteria for clonality, but the
patient had 37% TP53 deletion by FISH. Three patients
had a complex karyotype and del(17p) detected by FISH
but no abnormalities involving 17p on conventional cytogenetics; 2 had a low percentage of TP53 deletion by
FISH (7.5% and 24%), whereas 1 had 83% TP53 deletion by FISH.
Response to Treatment

The overall response rate for the entire population was
94.3%; 18% achieved CR. The overall response rate did
not differ according to baseline characteristics (Table 2).
The CR rate was 50% among patients who received ibrutinib plus bendamustine and rituximab versus 10.7% for
patients who received ibrutinib monotherapy or ibrutinib
plus rituximab (OR, 40.1 [95% CI 3.0-538.5]; P 5 .005).
In MVA, receiving a bendamustine-containing regimen was strongly associated with the odds of achieving
CR (OR, 85.2 [95% CI 3.2-2247.7]; P 5 .008). Patients
with an unmutated immunoglobulin heavy-chain variable
(IGHV) gene (OR, 0.001 [95% CI 0.000-0.273];
P 5 .014) had lower odds of achieving CR, whereas
patients with a baseline b2-microglobulin level  4.0 mg/l
(OR, 0.05 [95% CI 0.002-1.13]; P 5 .051) showed a
trend toward lower odds of achieving CR. There was no
association between high-risk FISH, sex, or advanced Rai
stage and the odds of achieving CR in MVA.
EFS

The median follow-up for surviving patients was 28
months (range, 14-48 months). In univariate analyses,
the following were significantly associated with shorter
EFS: female sex (median EFS, 22 months vs not
reached [NR]; P 5 .001), advanced Rai stage disease
(median EFS, 38.3 months for Rai stages III and IV vs
NR for Rai stages 0-II; P 5 .047), del(17p) (32 months
vs NR, P 5 .021), and CKT (19 vs 39 months,
P < .001; Fig. 2). There was a strong trend toward inferior EFS for patients with fludarabine-refractory disease (median EFS, 27 months vs NR; P 5 .059). There
was no association between EFS and a proportion of
cells with del(17p)  50% by FISH, an age > 65 years,

the mutation status, bulky lymphadenopathy  5 cm, a
baseline b2-microglobulin level  4.0 mg/L, or more
than 2 prior therapies. In MVA, only CKT was
significantly associated with EFS (hazard ratio [HR], 6.6
[1.7-25.6]; P 5 .006). There was no association between
del(17p) by FISH and EFS in MVA (P 5 .995). When
only patients with del(17p) were analyzed, there was a
strong trend (P 5 .056) toward inferior EFS for those
with a complex karyotype versus those without one (Fig.
2). We separately analyzed all patients for whom karyotyping was attempted and divided them into 3 groups:
those with a diploid karyotype or insufficient metaphases
for analysis, those with a complex karyotype, and those
with noncomplex clonal abnormalities. Those with a
complex karyotype had inferior EFS (P < .0001). There
was no significant difference in EFS between patients
with a diploid karyotype/insufficient metaphases and
those with noncomplex clonal abnormalities (Fig. 2).
Events During Treatment and Timing of Events

Events and the timing of events leading to permanent
treatment cessation are shown in Table 3. Treatment was

very well tolerated, with permanent treatment cessation
due to toxicity occurring in only 3 patients; all events
occurred before 12 months of therapy (persistent diarrhea
in 1, gastrointestinal bleeding in the setting of acquired
von Willebrand’s disease in 1, and recurrent infections in
1). Nine patients developed progressive CLL, and 5 developed Richter transformation. Notably, all cases of progressive CLL developed beyond 6 months of therapy, and
7 of the 9 cases occurred beyond 12 months of therapy.
The 5 cases of Richter transformation occurred 2, 4.5, 13,
21, and 21.5 months after the initiation of therapy. The
patient who experienced transformation at 4.5 months
had complex chromosomal abnormalities on metaphase
analysis but fewer than 10 metaphases available for analysis and was, therefore, included in the unknown karyotype
group. Of the 35 patients without CKT, only 1 developed
disease progression, and 1 developed Richter transformation, whereas none required therapy for other cancers;
none of the 7 patients with del(17p) who did not also
have CKT developed disease progression or other cancers,
with the only 2 events in these 7 patients being cessation
of treatment after 4 months due to gastrointestinal

due to staphylococcal pneumonia. In contrast, 4 cases of
CLL progression, 3 of Richter transformation, and 3 of
other cancers requiring therapy were seen in the 21
patients with CKT. Seven patients underwent planned
allo-SCT during remission and were censored for EFS
analysis on the date that ibrutinib was last taken.
OS

The following were significantly associated with shorter
OS in the univariate analysis: fludarabine-refractory CLL
(28 months vs NR, P 5 .009), del(17p) (33 months vs
NR, P 5 .012), and CKT (25 months vs NR, P 5 .007;
Fig. 3). There was a trend for shorter survival in patients
with a baseline b2-microglobulin level  4.0 mg/l
(42 months vs NR, P 5 .078). There was no association
between OS and the percentage of cells with del(17p) by

P 5 .008) were significantly and independently associated
with shorter survival. There was no association between
del(17p) and OS (P 5 .885) in MVA. A separate analysis
showed that patients with a complex karyotype had survival inferior (P 5 .02) to that of patients with noncomplex clonal abnormalities or either a diploid karyotype or
insufficient metaphases for analysis. There was no significant difference in survival between patients with a diploid
karyotype or insufficient metaphases for analysis and
those with noncomplex clonal abnormalities (Fig. 3).

there was no association between del(17p) and EFS or OS

large part be due to the coexistence of CKT rather than
the presence of del(17p) per se. Patients without CKT,

appeared to have excellent disease-specific outcomes with
ibrutinib-based therapy, with a very low rate of CLL progression or Richter transformation; patients with del(17p)
but without CKT had relatively good outcomes and
appeared to have a low risk of disease progression,
although small numbers limit conclusions for this subpopulation. In addition, we identified fludarabine-refractory
disease as being associated with inferior OS in MVA.
Technical challenges associated with metaphase
cytogenetic analysis have limited its widespread utilization
in CLL. During the period of enrollment for the studies
we report here, we used lipopolysaccharide stimulation
for the culturing of bone marrow specimens, which
reportedly achieves rates of analyzable metaphases of
approximately 50%.10,23 The rate of successful metaphase
generation was higher in our patient population (56 of 63
patients); this higher rate of metaphase generation may in
part be explained by the R/R population, which may have
more proliferative CLL clones than untreated populations. There were discrepancies between FISH and metaphase karyotyping in several cases. Notably, 9 of 24
patients with del(17p) detected by FISH had no clonal
abnormalities involving 17p detected by the metaphase
karyotype. In 2 of 9 cases, the percentage of TP53 deletion
by FISH was low, and this likely represented a subclonal
population; metaphase analysis may by chance have not
detected the 17p deletion because of its low frequency. In
the remaining cases, which had 24% TP53 deletion by
FISH, mitoses may have been obtained from nonneoplastic normal cells rather than the CLL population. These
discrepant results illustrate the technical difficulties
involved in conventional cytogenetic analysis in CLL, and
despite the important information provided by conventional karyotyping, FISH, therefore, remains an essential
component of the pretreatment evaluation. It is possible
that because of the relative insensitivity of our karyotyping
technique, successful metaphase generation is more likely

the ability to generate sufficient CLL metaphases for analysis was strongly associated with outcome, we divided all
patients for whom karyotyping was attempted into 3
groups: those with CKT, those with noncomplex clonal
abnormalities, and those with either a diploid karyotype or
insufficient clonal metaphases for analysis. Importantly,
there was no difference in EFS or survival between patients
with noncomplex clonal abnormalities and those with either a diploid karyotype or insufficient clonal abnormalities
(a significant number of which likely represented a technical failure to generate CLL metaphases for analysis). Recent
technical advances, such as the use of CpG oligonucleotides
and interleukin 2, pokeweed mitogen, and phorbol myristate acetate, allow the generation of sufficient metaphases
for analysis in at least 80% of patients and may limit the
number of patients misclassified as a result of technical failure.8,23 Our laboratory recently started using this combination for conventional karyotyping in CLL. We plan to
repeat this analysis with this newer karyotyping technique
in a currently enrolling randomized study of 200 patients
receiving ibrutinib with or without rituximab.
The precise mechanisms by which del(17p) and
CKT contribute to the development of ibrutinib resistance are not clear. These patients may have a higher likelihood of developing specific resistance mutations such as
the C481S mutation in BTK and activating mutations in
phospholipase Cc2 because of genomic instability.6 However, these mutations represent only a subset of cases with
clinical drug resistance, and additional gene mutations
present at the baseline or evolving during therapy may
also be important; we did not have gene sequencing data
available for patients treated in these studies. Elucidating
other causes of ibrutinib resistance to allow subsequent
treatment to be rationally selected according to the specific resistance pattern in an individual remains a major
research priority.

Complex Karyotype: High Risk in CLL/Thompson et al

Figure 3. OS analysis. (A) OS according to FISH for all patients. (B) OS according to the presence or absence of a complex metaphase karyotype. (C) OS according to the FISH hierarchy for patients without a complex metaphase karyotype. (D) OS for
patients with del(17p) according to the coexistence or absence of a complex karyotype. (E) OS according to the presence or absence of fludarabine-refractory disease. (F) OS according to the karyotype group for all patients for whom a karyotype was
attempted. FISH indicates fluorescence in situ hybridization; OS, overall survival.

Important questions remain unanswered regarding
the optimal management of high-risk patients, such as
those with CKT, initially treated with ibrutinib-based regimens. In contrast to allo-SCT, which achieves long-term
remission in approximately 50% of patients with conventionally defined high-risk CLL,2,24,25 long-term survival

based therapy are unknown; a median OS of only 25
months with ibrutinib-based treatment for patients with
CKT, however, clearly indicates a high-risk disease requiring the development of more potent therapy. One potential strategy could be to perform allo-SCT in high-risk
patients after ibrutinib-based induction. However,
although allo-SCT has been shown to overcome the poor

prognosis associated with del(17p),2,3 only 1 study specifically addressed the outcomes of patients with CKT treated
with allo-SCT,12 and it suggested that patients with CKT
had poorer outcomes after allo-SCT than those without
CKT. This study was small (n 5 51), and the majority of
patients received in vivo T-cell depletion; in vivo T-cell
depletion with alemtuzumab as part of reduced-intensity
conditioning for allo-SCT for CLL has been associated
with a higher relapse rate and poorer survival outcomes.2
Larger studies are required to address the important question of whether allo-SCT ameliorates the poor outcomes
associated with CKT. The outcomes of patients treated
with allo-SCT after induction with B cell receptor signaling inhibitors or BCL2 inhibitors such as ABT199 (Venetoclax) are also unknown, as is the optimal timing of alloSCT in patients responding to ibrutinib. The value of
posttransplant maintenance treatment with novel agents
will also be important to address in future studies. Finally,
the potential for combinations of ibrutinib with other
novel agents, particularly BCL2 inhibitors, to induce
deeper and more durable remissions and whether this
will, in turn, obviate allo-SCT in these high-risk patients
need to be assessed.
In summary, CKT may be associated with a particularly poor outcome for R/R CLL patients treated with
ibrutinib-based regimens; in contrast, patients with
del(17p) in the absence of CKT may have relatively favorable outcomes and require a less aggressive approach.
These findings, however, require confirmation in larger
groups of patients with more sensitive karyotyping techniques. Because of their poor outcomes, patients with CKT
are likely an ideal group for future studies of novel
ibrutinib-based combinations or sequential therapies,
including allo-SCT.
