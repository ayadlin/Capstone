Abstract
Tumor necrosis factor–related apoptosis-inducing ligand
(TRAIL/Apo-2L) has emerged as a promising anticancer agent.
However, resistance to TRAIL is likely to be a major problem,
and sensitization of cancer cells to TRAIL may therefore be an
important anticancer strategy. In this study, we examined the
effect of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)–
tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) gefitinib and a human
epidermal receptor 2 (HER2)–TKI (M578440) on the sensitivity
of human colorectal cancer (CRC) cell lines to recombinant
human TRAIL (rhTRAIL). A synergistic interaction between
rhTRAIL and gefitinib and rhTRAIL and M578440 was
observed in both rhTRAIL-sensitive and resistant CRC cells.
This synergy correlated with an increase in EGFR and HER2
activation after rhTRAIL treatment. Furthermore, treatment
of CRC cells with rhTRAIL resulted in activation of the Src
family kinases (SFK). Importantly, we found that rhTRAIL
treatment induced shedding of transforming growth factor-A
(TGF-A) that was dependent on SFK activity and the protease
ADAM-17. Moreover, this shedding of TGF-A was critical for
rhTRAIL-induced activation of EGFR. In support of this, SFK
inhibitors and small interfering RNAs targeting ADAM-17 and
TGF-A also sensitized CRC cells to rhTRAIL-mediated apoptosis. Taken together, our findings indicate that both
rhTRAIL-sensitive and resistant CRC cells respond to rhTRAIL
treatment by activating an EGFR/HER2-mediated survival
response and that these cells can be sensitized to rhTRAIL
using EGFR/HER2-targeted therapies. Furthermore, this acute
response to rhTRAIL is regulated by SFK-mediated and ADAM17–mediated shedding of TGF-A, such that targeting SFKs or
inhibiting ADAM-17, in combination with rhTRAIL, may
enhance the response of CRC tumors to rhTRAIL. [Cancer

Introduction
The tumor necrosis factor (TNF)–related apoptosis-inducing
ligand (TRAIL) and Fas ligand (FasL) belong to the proapoptotic
cytokines of the TNF superfamily (1). TRAIL can interact with five
distinct type 1 transmembrane receptors, two of which are death
receptors, TRAIL-R1/DR4 and TRAIL-R2/DR5, and three of which

are decoy receptors, DcR-1/TRAIL-R3, DcR-2/TRAIL-R4, and
osteoprotegerin. Ligation of functional receptors with TRAIL
leads to formation of death-inducing signaling complexes (DISC).
The intracellular death domain (DD) of these receptors recruits
the Fas-associated DD (FADD)–containing protein, which in turn
binds procaspase-8. After recruitment to the DISC, procaspase-8 is
activated by autoproteolytic cleavage, resulting in initiation of an
apoptotic cascade (2). Constitutive expression of death receptors
and TRAIL has been observed in a wide range of human tissue
types, including colorectal cancer (CRC; ref. 3). Furthermore,
TRAIL has been shown to induce apoptosis in many cancer types
with limited toxicities in normal tissues (4). Hence, various
approaches have been developed to target the TRAIL receptors
therapeutically, and several phase I studies are currently ongoing
in solid tumors evaluating the effect of fully human agonist
monoclonal antibodies (mAb) against TRAIL-R1/DR4 (such as
mapatumumab, Human Genome Sciences, Inc.) and TRAIL-R2/
DR5 (such as lexatumumab, Human Genome Sciences, Inc. and
AMG655, Amgen) or agents that target both receptors (such as
rhApo2L/TRAIL, Genentech). Inherent tumor resistance may be a
major barrier for effective TRAIL-targeted therapy, so it is
important to understand these resistance mechanisms and to
identify agents that sensitize cancer cells to TRAIL-mediated
apoptosis.
The human epidermal receptor (HER) family of receptor tyrosine
kinases and their ligands are important regulators of tumor cell
proliferation, survival, angiogenesis, and metastasis (5). The family
comprises four members: HER1 [ErbB1/epidermal growth factor
receptor (EGFR)], HER2 (ErbB2/Neu), HER3 (ErbB3), and HER4
(ErbB4; ref. 6). Seven ligands have been reported to bind EGFR,
including the EGFR-specific ligands, EGF, transforming growth
factor-a (TGF-a), amphiregulin, and epigen, and the ligands with
dual specificity, heparin-binding EGF (HB-EGF), h-cellulin, and
epiregulin (6). EGFR ligands are synthesized as transmembrane
precursors that can be proteolytically cleaved by cell surface
proteases, in particular members of the ADAM (a desintegrin and
metalloprotease) family (7). ADAM-mediated ligand shedding
results in enhanced autocrine, juxtacrine, and paracrine signaling.
These ligands bind to EGFR resulting in the formation of
homodimers or heterodimers, tyrosine kinase activation, receptor
autophosphorylation, and activation of multiple downstream
signaling cascades (6). As EGFR and HER2 are frequently aberrantly
overexpressed, mutated, and/or activated in a wide range of human
tumors, these receptors represent attractive targets for the
treatment of cancer (8). This has resulted in the development of
multiple anti-HER therapeutics, including the mAbs trastuzumab
(directed against HER2) and cetuximab (directed against EGFR), as
well as low molecular weight tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI)
targeting EGFR (e.g., gefitinib, erlotinib) and HER2 (e.g., CP-724,714,
M578440).

Src and ADAM-17–Mediated TRAIL-Induced EGFR Activation

Recently, we have shown that CRC and non–small cell lung
cancer cells exposed to different cytotoxic agents may respond to
chemotherapy with an EGFR-mediated prosurvival response, which
can be blocked by EGFR-targeted agents (9, 10). Furthermore,
Chinnaiyan and colleagues reported that radiation-induced EGFR
phosphorylation could be the mechanism underlying the synergism
observed between erlotinib and radiation (11). Recently, several
studies have shown that various members of the ADAM family,
such as ADAM-17, ADAM-15, ADAM-12, ADAM-10, and ADAM-9,
may be involved in EGFR activation after cytokine stimulation of
various G protein–coupled receptors and oxidative or osmotic
stress (12–14). Furthermore, cytoplasmic nonreceptor tyrosine
kinases, such as PKC, Janus-activated kinase 2, and Src family
kinases (SFK), have been shown to activate EGFR (15–17).
The aim of the present study was to investigate the role of the
EGFR/HER2 survival pathway in regulating TRAIL-induced cytotoxicity in a panel of CRC cell lines.

Materials and Methods
Materials. All chemicals and reagents of Analar grade were obtained
from BDH Laboratory Supplies, unless otherwise stated. Gefitinib, the HER2
selective TKI, M578440, and AZD0530 were provided by AstraZeneca. A
10 mmol/L working solution of gefitinib, M578440, and AZD0530 in DMSO
was prepared, aliquotted, and stored at 20jC. PP2 was obtained from
Calbiochem. Recombinant human TRAIL (rhTRAIL) was provided by
Calbiochem. A 20 Ag/mL stock solution of rhTRAIL was prepared in PBS/
0.1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) and stored at 70jC. Recombinant TGFa was purchased from Calbiochem and reconstituted to a concentration of
50 Ag/mL in 10 mmol/L acetic acid containing 0.1% BSA and stored at
70jC. Recombinant NRG1 was obtained from R&D Systems and
reconstituted to a concentration of 25 Ag/mL in BPS containing 0.1% BSA
and stored at 20jC.
Cell culture. All tissue culture material was obtained from Invitrogen,
unless otherwise stated. HCT116-p53wt and HCT116-p53null isogenic
human CRC cells were kindly provided by Bert Vogelstein (Johns Hopkins
University) and maintained in McCoy’s 5A medium. LoVo CRC cells,
supplied by AstraZeneca, were grown in DMEM. H630, RKO, and HT-29
human CRC cell lines were provided by the National Cancer Institute
and maintained in DMEM. All medium was supplemented with 10% FCS,
50 Ag/mL penicillin-streptomycin, 2 mmol/L L-glutamine, and 1 mmol/L
sodium pyruvate (Invitrogen). All cells were grown in a humidified
atmosphere with 5% CO2 at 37jC.
Cell viability assay. Cell viability was assessed by the tetrazolium dye
[3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide, Sigma] assay
(18). Cells were seeded at 2,000 to 4,000 per well in 96-well plates. Cells were
treated with increasing doses of gefitinib or M578440 for 72 h. After
treatment, cells were washed once with 1  PBS and incubated with
medium containing 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium
bromide (0.5 mg/mL) for 3 h at 37jC. Culture medium with 3-(4,5dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide was removed, and
formazan crystals were reabsorbed in 200 AL DMSO (Sigma). Cell viability
was determined by measuring the absorbance at 570 nm, using a microplate
reader (Molecular Devices). IC50 was calculated using Prism software
package. Each value is representative of at least three independent
experiments.
Flow cytometric analysis and cell death measurement. Cells were
seeded at a density of 1  105 cells per well in six-well plates. After
treatment, DNA content was evaluated by propidium iodide (Sigma)
staining of cells by resuspending them in 360 AL 0.1% FCS, 10 Ag/mL
propidium iodide, 0.25 mg/mL RNaseA in 1  PBS. Samples were incubated
for at least 30 min before analysis on the EPICS XL Flow Cytometer
(Coulter). The extent of cell death was determined by evaluating the
percentage of cells with DNA content of <2N.
Detection of cell surface EGFR and HER2 expression. Cells were
seeded at a density of 1.5  105 per well in six-well plates. Twenty-four

hours after seeding, cells were treated with increasing doses of rTRAIL for
24 h. Cells were trypsinized and resuspended in 100 AL of either a
nonconjugated anti-EGFR mAb (Santa Cruz) or an FITC-conjugated antiHER2 mAb (FITC, Santa Cruz) at a dilution of 1:20 and allowed to incubate
in the dark for 60 min at 4jC. A mouse IgG1 (DAKO) was used as an
isotype-matched control. Cells incubated with the anti-EGFR mAb were
incubated in the dark for 60 min at 4jC with an FITC-labeled goat antimouse IgG secondary antibody (1:20; Sigma). After incubation with FITClabeled antibody, the cells were washed thrice with ice-cold PBS and then
resuspended in 300 AL 1% paraformaldehyde. Fluorescence was evaluated
using the EPICS XL Flow Cytometer (Coulter).
Western blotting. Cells were harvested in ice-cold PBS, pelleted, and
snap frozen in liquid nitrogen. Cell pellets were resuspended in radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer [50 mmol/L Tris (pH 7.5), 150 mmol/L
NaCl, 1% NP40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS] with protease
inhibitors (Roche Diagnostics GmbH), 1 mmol/L sodium orthovanadate
(Sigma), and 10 mmol/L sodium fluoride. Cells were then lysed by passing
them through a 25-gauge needle 10 times and centrifuged at 13,200 rpm/
4jC for 20 min to remove cell debris. Protein concentration was determined
using the bicinchoninic acid protein assay reagent (Pierce). Each protein
sample (20–40 Ag) was resolved on SDS-polyacrylamide gels (8%) and
transferred to a PROTRAN BA 83 nitrocellulose membrane (Whatman,
Schleicher & Schuell). Immunodetections were performed using anti-EGFR
(Clone 13, PharMingen, BD Biosciences), anti-HER2 (Clone e2-4001,
Neomarkers, Lab Vision Corp.), anti-HER3 (Clone 2C3, Neomarkers),
caspase 8 (Alexis), and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP; eBioscience)
mouse mAbs in conjunction with a horseradish peroxidase (HRP)–
conjugated antimouse secondary antibody (Amersham). Anti–phosphorylated EGFR (Tyr1068; Calbiochem), anti–phosphorylated HER2
(Tyr1248; Santa Cruz), anti–phosphorylated HER3 (Tyr1289; Cell Signaling),
anti–phosphorylated Akt (Ser473, Cell Signaling), anti-Akt (Cell Signaling),
anti–phosphorylated SFK (Tyr418; Biosource), anti-Src (Cell Signaling), anti–
ADAM-17 (Pharmigen), and caspase-3 (Cell Signaling) rabbit polyclonal
antibodies were used in conjunction with an HRP-conjugated antirabbit
secondary antibody (Amersham). Equal loading was assessed using
h-tubulin (Sigma), h-actin (Sigma), or glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (Biogenesis) mouse monoclonal primary antibodies. The Super
Signal chemiluminescent system (Pierce) or ECL-plus (Amersham) were
used for detection.
Small interfering RNA transfections. ADAM-17, TGF-a, and scramble
control (SC) small interfering RNAs (siRNA) were obtained from
Dharmacon. HCT116 and LoVo cells were seeded out in the appropriate
media without penicillin-streptomycin. Twenty-four hours after seeding,
siRNA transfections were performed on subconfluent cells incubated in
unsupplemented Optimem using the oligofectamine reagent (both from
Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. After 4 h, growth
medium was added thrice; cells were treated with rTRAIL 1 h after this.
TGF-A ELISA. An equal number of HCT116 and LoVo cells were plated
into 24-well plates and incubated for 24 h in penicillin-streptomycin–free
media supplemented with 2% FCS. Cells were thereafter either transfected
with SC, ADAM-17 siRNA, or TGF-a siRNA or preincubated with PP2 or
AZD0530 for 4 h. After this, cells were treated with rTRAIL for 24 h, and
TGF-a levels in conditioned medium were measured by ELISA according to
the manufacturer’s instructions (Calbiochem).
Statistical analysis. Two-way ANOVA test was used to determine the
significance of change in levels of apoptosis between different treatment
groups. All changes in levels of apoptosis that are described as significant
had P values that were <0.05 (*, P < 0.05; **, P < 0.01; ***, P < 0.005).

the sensitivity of CRC cells to rhTRAIL, HCT116-p53wt, HCT116p53null, LoVo (p53wt), RKO (p53wt), HT29 (p53mut), and H630

Figure 1. TRAIL receptor expression and sensitivity of a panel of CRC cells to rhTRAIL, gefitinib, and M578440. A, rhTRAIL-induced apoptosis in HCT116-p53wt,
HCT116-p53null, HT29, RKO, H630, and LoVo as determined by flow cytometry. The DNA-content of propidium iodide-stained cells was analyzed after 24-h
treatment with rhTRAIL, and the extent of cell death was determined by evaluating the percentage of cells with DNA content <2N. B, DR4, DR5, DcR1, and
DcR2 cell membrane expression was assessed by flow cytometry using receptor-specific phycoerythrin-conjugated mAbs. Expression was compared with a
nonspecific isotype-matched control antibody. C, cells were treated with increasing doses of gefitinib or M578440 for 72 h, and cell viability was determined by
3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay. IC50 was calculated using Prism software package. Representative values of at least three
independent experiments. D, effect of EGF, gefitinib, and M578440 on pEGFR and pHER2. LoVo and HCT116 CRC cells were incubated with 0.1, 1, and 10 Amol/L of
gefitinib or M578440 for 6 h followed by EGF stimulation (100 ng/mL) for 15 min and pEGFRY1068, total EGFR (tEGFR ), pHER2Y1248, and tHER2 levels were determined
by Western blotting. Equal loading was assessed by probing for h-tubulin.

flow cytometry (Fig. 1A). Although, p53wt HCT116 cells were
slightly more sensitive to rhTRAIL than the p53null daughter cell
line, the p53wt RKO and p53mutant HT29 cells were both resistant
to rhTRAIL, whereas the p53wt LoVo and p53mutant H630 cell
lines were sensitive to rhTRAIL. Collectively, these results suggest
that p53 status does not determine sensitivity to rhTRAIL. To
evaluate whether the sensitivity to rhTRAIL correlated with
expression levels of its receptors, we determined the constitutive
cell surface expression of DR4 and DR5 and the TRAIL decoy
receptors DcR1 and DcR2 using flow cytometry (Fig. 1B). All six cell
lines expressed DR5, with lowest expression in the LoVo cell line.
DR4 was expressed in both HCT116 cell lines but at a lower level
than DR5. DR4 was detectable but expressed at a low level in each
of the other four cell lines. The H630 cell line was the only one to
significantly express DcR1. DcR2 was expressed at very low levels
or was undetectable in this cell line panel. Overall, sensitivity to
rhTRAIL did not correlate with constitutive cell surface expression
levels of the TRAIL receptors. Furthermore, the expression of these
receptors did not correlate with p53 status.

inhibition, we examined the antiproliferative activity of the EGFRselective TKI gefitinib and the HER2-selective TKI M578440 in the
cell line panel. M578440 inhibits the HER2 kinase in vitro with an
IC50 of 2 nmol/L compared with 140 nmol/L for EGFR (19),
whereas gefitinib has been found to inhibit EGFR kinase activity
with an IC50 of 33 nmol/L compared with 3.7 to 10 Amol/L for
HER2 (20). The IC50 concentrations of gefitinib ranged from 2.4 to
9 Amol/L, whereas the IC50 concentrations of M578440 were more
uniform across the panel, ranging from 1.4 to 2.5 Amol/L (Fig. 1C).
We also determined the effect of gefitinib and M578440 on EGFinduced EGFR and HER2 activation in LoVo and HCT116 CRC cells.
In both cell lines, rEGF treatment resulted in activation of both
EGFR and HER2, suggesting crosstalk between EGFR and HER2 in
these cell lines (Fig. 1D). In rEGF stimulated LoVo cells, inhibition
of EGFR activity with 1 Amol/L gefitinib also led to a complete
inhibition of HER2 phosphorylation. Furthermore, inhibition of
HER2 led to decreased EGFR phosphorylation, suggesting the
formation of EGFR/HER2 heterodimers in response to rEGF
stimulation. Although gefitinib treatment potently inhibited both
EGFR and HER2 activation in response to rEGF in the HCT116 cell
line, EGFR activity was much less inhibited by M578440 (Fig. 1D).

Src and ADAM-17–Mediated TRAIL-Induced EGFR Activation

So, in the HCT116 cell line, it seems that, whereas HER2 is reliant
on heterodimerization with EGFR for activation after EGF
stimulation, EGFR activation is not solely dependent on HER2
activity, presumably because EGFR can efficiently homodimerize
and/or heterodimerize with other HER receptors in this cell line
after EGF treatment.
Effect of gefitinib and M578440 on rhTRAIL-induced
apoptosis. To determine whether inhibition of EGFR and HER2
would sensitize CRC cells to rhTRAIL, we assessed the effect of
gefitinib and M578440 on rhTRAIL-induced apoptosis (Fig. 2 and
Supplementary Fig. S1). CRC cells were exposed to each TKI for
24 hours, followed by rhTRAIL for 24 hours. Gefitinib alone had no
effect on apoptosis in the HCT116 and HT29 cell lines but did
moderately increase cell death in H630 and LoVo cells. Treatment
with M578440 alone induced significant levels of apoptosis in the
HCT116 cell lines but had no or little effect on apoptosis in the
other cell lines. Both gefitinib and M578440 sensitized HCT116p53wt cells to apoptosis induced by rhTRAIL, as indicated by the
percentage of cells in the sub–G0-G1 apoptotic fraction (Fig. 2A and C).
C). Gefitinib and M578440 also sensitized the p53 null HCT116
daughter cell line to rhTRAIL, indicating that this interaction is
independent of the p53 status (Fig. 2A and C). Representative
histograms are presented in Fig. 2B. Consistent with the HCT116
cell lines, gefitinib and M578440 sensitized both LoVo and H630
cell lines to apoptosis induced by rhTRAIL (Fig. 2A and C and
Supplementary Fig. S1). Interestingly, inhibition of EGFR and HER2
activity sensitized the rhTRAIL-resistant HT29 cell line to rhTRAIL

(Supplementary Fig. S1). These results were confirmed by Western
blot analysis, which indicated that pretreatment of HCT116-p53wt
and LoVo cells with either gefitinib or M578440 enhanced PARP
cleavage (a marker of apoptosis) induced by rhTRAIL (Fig. 2D).
Furthermore, there was evidence of enhanced rhTRAIL-induced
caspase-8 activation in LoVo cells after pretreatment with gefitinib
or M578440 and in HCT116-p53wt cells after pretreatment with
M578440. Collectively, these data indicate that EGFR and HER2 are
important regulators of CRC cell death induced by rhTRAIL.
Effect of rhTRAIL on EGFR and HER2 activation. To elucidate
the mechanisms involved in regulating the interaction between
HER-targeted TKIs and rhTRAIL, we examined the effect of
rhTRAIL on EGFR and HER2 phosphorylation in the HCT116p53wt, HCT116-p53null, LoVo, and H630 cell lines. EGFR
phosphorylation was measured using a phosphorylated-specific
EGFR antibody directed against phosphorylated Y1068 that reflects
the activation state of the receptor (21). The HER2Y1248 autophosphorylation site has been shown to couple the receptor to the RASMAPK-Jun pathway has been closely linked to the oncogenic
potential of HER2 (22). In all four cell lines, a dose-dependent
increase in EGFR and HER2 phosphorylation was observed 24
hours after rhTRAIL exposure (Fig. 3A). There was no change in
total EGFR or HER2 expression levels after treatment with
rhTRAIL, indicating that the receptors are activated in response
to rhTRAIL (Fig. 3A). siRNA-mediated silencing of DR4 and DR5
abrogated rhTRAIL-induced phosphorylation of EGFR and HER2
(data not shown), indicating that the activation of EGFR and HER2

rhTRAIL for 24 h. The cell cycle status of the cells was monitored by flow cytometry after propidium iodide staining. Percentages of cells in sub-G1 phase are given.

Figure 3. Effect of rhTRAIL on EGFR
and HER2 activation and expression.
A, HCT116-p53wt, HCT116-p53null,
H630, and LoVo cells were treated with
increasing doses of rhTRAIL for 24 h and
pEGFRY1068, tEGFR, pHER2Y1248, and

probing for h-tubulin. B, HCT116-p53wt

by rhTRAIL was dependent on the TRAIL death receptors and not
on the decoy receptors, which are in any case expressed at very low
levels (if at all) in these models (Fig. 1B). The effect of rhTRAIL on
HER3 expression and activation was also assessed (Supplementary
Fig. S2). In contrast to EGFR and HER2, HER3 was not activated in
response to rhTRAIL treatment in either cell line. We also assessed
cell surface expression of EGFR and HER2 after treatment with
rhTRAIL in the HCT116-p53 wt and LoVo cell lines (Fig. 3B).
Interestingly, a significant decrease in cell surface expression of
EGFR and HER2 was observed in HCT116-p53wt cell line at higher
doses of rhTRAIL. Consistent with the findings of others (23), we
have found that receptor internalization is triggered after ligandmediated HER activation in these cell line models (data not
shown). The LoVo cell line also exhibited a significant dosedependent decrease in EGFR cell surface expression in response to
rhTRAIL, but no change in HER2 cell surface expression was
observed; however, HER2 cell surface expression is relatively low in
this cell line. Taken together, these results indicate that rhTRAIL
activates EGFR and HER2 in CRC cells.
The role of Src family kinases in regulating rhTRAILinduced EGFR activation. Cytoplasmic nonreceptor tyrosine
kinases, such as c-Src and Yes, have been shown to activate the
EGFR in response to a variety of stimuli (24–26). To gain insight
into the mechanism of increased EGFR and HER2 activation in

Cancer Res 2008; 68: (20). October 15, 2008

CRC cells treated with rhTRAIL, we examined the effect of rhTRAIL
on SFK expression and phosphorylation in HCT116-p53wt and
LoVo CRC cells. c-Src activation was measured using a phosphorylated-specific antibody directed against the Y418 autophosphorylation site, which represents fully catalytic active c-Src (27). As the
region containing Y418 is highly conserved in other related Src
family kinases, this antibody may also react with Fyn and Yes. In
HCT116-p53wt (Fig. 4A, left) and LoVo (Fig. 4A, right), increased
SFK activation correlated with activation of EGFR and HER2 after
24 hours treatment with rhTRAIL.
To investigate the sequence of EGFR and SFK activation after
rhTRAIL treatment, we examined the relative effects of the SFK
inhibitor PP2 and gefitinib on rhTRAIL-induced EGFR and SFK
phosphorylation, respectively (Fig. 4B). Treatment with 1 Amol/L
PP2 inhibited not only the increase in SFK phosphorylation after
treatment with rhTRAIL but also inhibited rhTRAIL-induced EGFR
and HER2 phosphorylation in HCT116-p53wt and LoVo cells. In
contrast, although treatment with gefitinib inhibited rhTRAILinduced EGFR phosphorylation, it had no significant effect on SFK
activation after rhTRAIL treatment in these cell lines. Taken
together, these results suggest that SFKs act upstream of EGFR
and play a role in the activation of EGFR after rhTRAIL treatment
in HCT116-p53wt and LoVo cells. Furthermore, pretreatment
with PP2 resulted in a significant supraadditive increase in

rhTRAIL-induced apoptosis in LoVo and HCT116 cells compared
with cells treated with rhTRAIL or PP2 alone (Fig. 4C). To provide
further support for the importance of SFKs in regulating rhTRAILinduced apoptosis, we used AZD0530, which is a more specific SFK
inhibitor than PP2. PP2 can also inhibit platelet-derived growth
factor receptor (PDGFR) with similar affinity as Src (PP2-Src IC50 =
1.4 Amol/L and PP2-PDGFR IC50 = 1.5 Amol/L; ref. 28; AZD0530-Src
IC50 = 0.0027 Amol/L and AZD0530-PDGFRa and PDGFRh, IC50 > 5
Amol/L; personal communication from AstraZeneca). We found that
AZD0530 inhibited constitutive SFK phosphorylation at concentrations of 0.1 Amol/L and above (Supplementary Fig. S3A).
Furthermore, EGFR phosphorylation was also down-regulated after
AZD0530 treatment, again indicating the dependence of EGFR
activity on SFK activity in these cell line models (Supplementary
Fig. S3A). Moreover, both HCT116 and LoVo cells were sensitized to
rhTRAIL after treatment with AZD0530 (Supplementary Fig. S3B),
similar to the results obtained with PP2.
Role of metalloproteases and ADAM-17 in rhTRAIL-induced
EGFR activation. Members of the zinc protease family and
metzincin subfamily (ADAMs) have been implicated in regulating
EGFR activity by cleaving and promoting the release of its ligands,
such as TGF-a, amphiregulin, and HB-EGF from the cell membrane
(12, 14). We investigated the possibility of metalloprotease
involvement in EGFR activation after rhTRAIL treatment in
HCT116-p53wt and LoVo cells. Treatment with 20 Amol/L
GM6001, a broad-spectrum hydroxamic acid matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) and ADAM inhibitor, resulted in inhibition of
rhTRAIL-induced activation of EGFR in both cell lines, suggesting
that metalloproteases are involved in rhTRAIL-induced activation
of EGFR (Fig. 5A). EGFR has been reported to be coexpressed with
ADAM-17 in cancer cells and endothelial cells of CRC tumors (29).

Moreover, ADAM-17 has been suggested to play a central role in the
shedding of EGFR ligands (7). Hence, we investigated whether
ADAM-17 played a role in rhTRAIL-induced EGFR activation using
an ADAM-17–specific siRNA (AD17 siRNA). AD17 siRNA downregulated ADAM-17 expression at concentrations of z1nmol/L
(Fig. 5B). Importantly, we found that silencing of ADAM-17
attenuated rhTRAIL-induced EGFR and HER2 activation in both
HCT116-p53wt and LoVo cells (Fig. 5C). As a single agent, AD17
siRNA had no significant effect on apoptosis in either cell line
(Fig. 5D, left). However, pretreatment with AD17 siRNA for
24 hours, followed by rhTRAIL for 24 hours, resulted in a
significant increase in apoptosis compared with rhTRAIL alone.
Taken together, these results suggest that rhTRAIL-induced
activation of EGFR/HER2 is ADAM-17–dependent and that by
inhibiting ADAM-17, EGFR/HER2-mediated prosurvival signaling
in response to rhTRAIL is inhibited and rhTRAIL-induced
apoptosis is synergistically enhanced.
Effect of TGF-A on rhTRAIL-induced EGFR/HER2 activation
and apoptosis. To determine whether rhTRAIL-induced EGFR and
HER2 activation in CRC cells is ligand-dependent, we examined the
effect of the anti-EGFR mouse-human chimeric mAb cetuximab
(C225) on rhTRAIL-induced EGFR and HER2 phosphorylation
(Fig. 5C). Cetuximab binds to the receptor with affinity comparable
with the natural ligands and competes for ligand binding thereby
inhibiting EGFR activation (30). In HCT116-p53wt and LoVo cells,
we found that C225 completely inhibited rhTRAIL-induced EGFR
and HER2 phosphorylation, suggesting that the activation of EGFR
and HER2 after rhTRAIL is related to binding of EGFR ligands to
the EGFR (Fig. 5C). As ADAM-17 has emerged as a major sheddase
for TGF-a, we also determined the effect of TGF-a gene silencing
on EGFR and HER2 phosphorylation in LoVo and HCT116 cells.

Using quantitative real-time PCR, we found a decrease of 70% to
80% in TGF-a mRNA expression after transfection with 5 nmol/L
TGF-a siRNA in the LoVo and HCT116 cell lines (data not shown).
Transfection with 5 nmol/L TGF-a siRNA (TGF) inhibited EGFR
and HER2 activation after rhTRAIL treatment in LoVo and HCT116
cells, and this down-regulation was similar to that observed when
ADAM-17 was silenced (Fig. 5C).
We next directly investigated the importance of ligands and, in
particular, TGF-a in regulating resistance to rhTRAIL using C225
and TGF-a–targeted siRNA (Fig. 5D, middle and right). In HCT116
and LoVo cells, pretreatment with C225 for 24 hours, followed by
rhTRAIL for 24 hours, resulted in a significant supraadditive/
synergistic increase in apoptosis compared with cells treated with
rhTRAIL or C225 alone, as determined by flow cytometry (Fig. 5D,
middle). Furthermore, a statistically significant supraadditive
increase in apoptosis was observed when TGF-a siRNA was
combined with rhTRAIL in the LoVo and HCT116 cells (Fig. 5D,
right), indicative of a synergistic interaction. Moreover, treatment
of HCT116 and LoVo cells with exogenous TGF-a abrogated
rhTRAIL-induced PARP cleavage and caspase-3 and caspase8 activation (Supplementary Fig. S4A). In addition, the apoptosis
induced by combined treatment with rhTRAIL and the SFK
inhibitor AZD0530 was also abrogated by coincubation with
exogenous TGF-a (Supplementary Fig. S4B). These results indicate
that TGF-a is an important mediator of resistance to rhTRAIL in
CRC cells.
Finally, we used an ELISA assay to directly assess shedding of
TGF-a into cell culture medium after rhTRAIL treatment in LoVo

and HCT116-p53wt CRC cells (Fig. 6). In both cell lines, rhTRAIL
induced TGF-a shedding, and this was attenuated when cells were
cotransfected with ADAM-17–targeted siRNA (Fig. 6, middle).
Furthermore, rhTRAIL-induced TGF-a shedding was abrogated in
cells cotreated with the SFK inhibitors PP2 (Fig. 6, right) and
AZD0530 (Supplementary Fig. S3C). Transfection with TGF-a
siRNA also significantly down-regulated TGF-a shedding from both
nontreated and rhTRAIL-treated cells, indicating both the specificity of the ELISA assay and the effectiveness of the TGFa–targeted siRNA (Fig. 6, left). Collectively, these data suggest that
TGF-a is required for rhTRAIL-induced EGFR activation and
EGFR/HER2 dimerization and that this process is mediated via
SFKs and ADAM-17.

Discussion
Due to its apoptosis-inducing capability, selectivity for tumor
cells and absence of significant adverse side effects, TRAIL-targeted
therapies have emerged as promising anticancer agents. Various
approaches have been developed to therapeutically target the
TRAIL receptors, and several phase I studies evaluating the effect of
fully human agonist mAbs against the TRAIL receptors DR4 and
DR5 are currently ongoing. However, inherent tumor resistant may
be a major barrier to effective TRAIL-targeted therapy (31, 32),
indicating that sensitization of cancer cells to the TRAIL-induced
apoptotic pathway is likely to be an important anticancer strategy.
Initially, we examined the sensitivity of a panel of CRC cell lines to
rhTRAIL as a single agent. We found that cell surface expression

Src and ADAM-17–Mediated TRAIL-Induced EGFR Activation

Figure 6. Role of SFKs and ADAM-17 in
rhTRAIL-induced TGF-a shedding. LoVo
and HCT116 cells were transfected with
5 nmol/L ADAM-17, 5 nmol/L TGF-a, or

levels of TRAIL receptors did not correlate with sensitivity to
rhTRAIL. Furthermore, although we found the HCT116-p53wt cell
line to be slightly more sensitive to rhTRAIL compared with its p53
null counterpart, there was no clear correlation between p53 status
and sensitivity to rhTRAIL.
Previously, we reported that down-regulation of c-FLIP after
chemotherapy treatment, sensitizes CRC cells to rhTRAIL-induced
apoptosis in vitro (33). Furthermore, previous reports have shown
that genistein, a broad-spectrum tyrosine kinase inhibitor, and
gefitinib sensitize human lung, gastric, and bladder cancer cells to
TRAIL (34–36). So, we decided to evaluate the effect of gefitinib on
rhTRAIL-induced cytotoxicity in CRC cell lines. We also studied the
role of HER2 using the selective HER2-TKI M578440. Interestingly,
pretreating rhTRAIL-sensitive and rhTRAIL-resistant cell lines to
gefitinib or M578440 markedly sensitized them to rhTRAILinduced apoptosis, indicating that inhibition of EGFR and HER2
may be a promising strategy for sensitizing CRC cells to TRAIL
agonists. To elucidate the mechanism underlying these interactions, we examined rhTRAIL-induced EGFR and HER2 expression
and phosphorylation. Importantly, the synergistic nature of the
interactions between rhTRAIL and the EGFR-targeted and HER2targeted TKIs correlated with a dose-dependent increase in EGFR
and HER2 phosphorylation after rhTRAIL treatment. Of note, HER3
was not activated in response to rhTRAIL in these model systems.
We have previously shown that chemotherapy-induced EGFR
activation predicts the effectiveness of combined treatment with
chemotherapy and EGFR-targeted therapies (9, 10). We found that
CRC cell lines that activated EGFR in response to chemotherapy
were sensitized to EGFR-targeted therapies. Our current findings
suggest that rhTRAIL also induces an EGFR/HER2-mediated
survival response in CRC cells and that, by blocking this response,
rhTRAIL sensitivity is enhanced.
The nonreceptor tyrosine kinases, c-Src and c-Yes, have been
found to activate the EGFR after osmotic stress and upon

stimulation of various G protein–coupled receptors (GPCR;
refs. 16, 25). The SFKs comprise nine members, some of which
are ubiquitously expressed (c-Src, c-Fyn, c-Yes) and some of which
display a more restricted expression (Blk, Yrk, Fgr, Hck, Lck, and
Lyn; ref. 37). In particular, c-Src is overexpressed in >70% of CRCs
and frequently activated in the advanced disease setting (38, 39).
Apart from its interaction with growth factor receptors, such as
EGFR and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor, c-Src plays
an important role in cell adhesion, migration, and metastasis
(39, 40). Initially, we examined the effect of rhTRAIL on SFK
activation and found that increased EGFR and HER2 activation was
associated with increased SFK activation after treatment with
rhTRAIL. Interestingly, similar results were obtained with the
agonistic Fas mAb CH-11: the synergistic interaction observed
between CH-11 and gefitinib or M578440 correlated with a dosedependent increase in EGFR, HER2, and SFK phosphorylation after
CH-11 treatment (data not shown), indicating that activation of
SFK, EGFR, and HER2 activation may be a common prosurvival
response after death receptor ligation. Furthermore, using the SFK
inhibitors PP2 and AZD0530, we showed that rhTRAIL-induced
EGFR activation is dependent on SFK activity in these cell lines.
Moreover, as gefitinib had no effect on TRAIL-induced SFK
phosphorylation, we can conclude that SFKs are upstream
activators of EGFR after treatment with rhTRAIL in these cell
lines. In support of this, we also found a highly synergistic
interaction between SFK inhibitors and rhTRAIL in our cell line
panel. Taken together, it seems that the combination of SFK
inhibition with rhTRAIL is a very promising anticancer strategy,
consistent with the concept that SFKs are central to multiple
oncogenic prosurvival signal transduction pathways.
Several reports have showed that, after GPCR stimulation, ADAMs can induce EGFR activation via the shedding of
different EGFR ligands (25, 41). We found that rhTRAIL-induced
EGFR phosphorylation in CRC cells was inhibited by the

broad-spectrum MMP-ADAM inhibitor GM6001. These results
suggested that ADAMs may regulate EGFR activation after
rhTRAIL treatment. Several studies have shown that different
ADAMs are key regulators of ectodomain shedding of the seven
ligands of EGFR (7). ADAM-17 is frequently overexpressed in solid
tumors, such as CRC, breast cancer, and hepatocellular carcinoma,
and this protease plays a central role in the shedding of EGFR
ligands (42). Furthermore, there is published evidence of an
association between c-Src and ADAM-17 after GPCR stimulation in
head and neck carcinoma cells (43). Hence, we determined the
effect of ADAM-17 gene silencing on EGFR activation after rhTRAIL
treatment. In both LoVo and HCT116 CRC cell lines, ADAM-17
silencing inhibited rhTRAIL-induced EGFR activation. In addition
to this, we investigated the interaction between ADAM-17 siRNA
and rhTRAIL in CRC cells and found a synergistic activation of
apoptosis in the LoVo and HCT116 cells after cotreatment with
ADAM-17 siRNA and rhTRAIL. Taken together, our data suggest
that ADAM-17 is an important regulator of EGFR activation in
response to rhTRAIL in CRC cells and that targeting this ADAM in
conjunction with rhTRAIL may have therapeutic potential.
To further assess whether rhTRAIL-induced EGFR activation is a
ligand-dependent process, we used the mAb cetuximab (C225),
which competes for ligand binding to the EGFR. We found that
C225 completely inhibited rhTRAIL-induced EGFR phosphorylation in LoVo and HCT116 cell lines, suggesting that rhTRAILinduced EGFR activation is due to binding of EGFR ligands to the
receptor. As ADAM-17 is the main sheddase for TGF-a, we
determined the role of TGF-a in regulating rhTRAIL-induced EGFR
activation in HCT116 and LoVo cell lines and found that TGF-a
siRNA inhibited rhTRAIL-induced EGFR activation. In addition, we
found that rhTRAIL-induced TGF-a shedding was abolished when
cells were cotreated with SFK inhibitors or cotransfected with
ADAM-17 siRNA, indicating that increased EGFR activity after
rhTRAIL treatment is induced through activation of SFKs and

ADAM-17, which in turn induces shedding of TGF-a. Furthermore,
the combination of TGF-a siRNA or cetuximab with rhTRAIL
resulted in synergistic increases in apoptosis, and addition of
exogenous TGF-a inhibited rhTRAIL-induced apoptosis.
In conclusion, our findings indicate that CRC cells respond to
rhTRAIL with an EGFR/HER2-mediated survival response and
that, by blocking this response, apoptosis is enhanced. These data
provide a preclinical rationale for the ongoing phase I study with the
EGFR human mAb Panitumumab in combination with the DR5
agonistic antibody AMG655 in patients with solid tumors.
Furthermore, we provide strong evidence that rhTRAIL induces
EGFR activation via a ligand-dependent mechanism in CRC, and we
have identified SFKs, ADAM-17, and TGF-a as critical mediators of
EGFR/HER2 activation after rhTRAIL treatment. We propose a
model in which rhTRAIL treatment results in SFK activation that in
turn activates ADAM-17–mediated shedding of TGF-a. TGF-a then
activates EGFR/HER2 prosurvival signaling in an autocrine and
paracrine fashion. Thus, inhibiting EGFR/HER2, SFKs, or specific
ADAMs (in particular ADAM-17) may have therapeutic potential
for sensitizing CRC tumors to TRAIL-targeted therapies.
