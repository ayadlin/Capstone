Abstract
There are currently limited therapeutic regimens available for
effective treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).
Silymarin is a naturally derived polyphenolic antioxidant with
hepatoprotective properties and is very widely used in clinical
application; however, effect of silymarin on spontaneous HCC
has not been studied. Silymarin was evaluated for its efficacy
against spontaneous carcinogenesis using the HBV X protein
(HBx) transgenic model. Silymarin was p.o. given to the HBx
transgenic mice from 4 to 6 weeks of age. Our data indicated
that silymarin has therapeutic effects on the early stages of
liver damage, reversing fatty changes and recovering liver
histopathology in a dose-dependent manner. To study the
chemopreventive effects on the later stages of carcinogenesis,
the mice at 13 months were split into a precancerous group
and a group with significant liver carcinogenesis. After
silymarin was given to the precancerous mice from 13 to
16 months of age, in contrast to an 80% incidence of HCC
development in the untreated transgenic mice, no HCC was
detected in any of these mice. Nonetheless, small hyperplastic
nodules were detected in 86% of these precancerous mice.
In the second group with notable HCC, silymarin was unable
to block cancer progression. Although silymarin did not affect
HBx expression, intracellular reactive oxygen species levels
were decreased, cell proliferation was stimulated, and
hepatocyte ultrastructure was found to significantly recover.
In conclusion, silymarin exerts beneficial effects on the early
stages of liver pathogenesis, preventing and delaying liver
carcinogenesis. This drug should be considered as a potential
chemopreventive agent for HBV-related hepatocarcinogenesis.

Introduction
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most common
and recurrent malignancies worldwide. Many risk factors, including
HBV infection, play a major role in the etiology of HCC (1).
However, there are limited therapeutic regimens available for the
effective treatment of liver cancer, and HCC is a disease with a very
poor prognosis. The fact that HCC exhibits a high recurrent rate

after resection and is resistant to conventional chemotherapy and
radiotherapy has rendered the disease a very serious health
problem due to the lack of effective therapeutic options for HCC
treatment at the current time (2–4). To reduce the morbidity and
mortality of HCC, the discovery and development of chemopreventive and therapeutic agents for HCC is of paramount
importance.
Oxidative stress is one of the key factors in tumorigenesis of
many cancer types, including HCC. Reactive oxygen species (ROS)
within cells act as second messengers in the signaling cascades that
induce and maintain the oncogenic phenotypes of cancer cells (5).
In addition, ROS can damage proteins, DNA, and RNA, as well as
oxidize fatty acids in cell membrane, and these changes lead to an
increased risk of mutation (6). Previous studies have shown that
overexpression of the HBV large surface antigen (lsAg) and HBV X
protein (HBx) leads to HCC development in transgenic mice (7, 8).
Both lsAg and HBx induce oxidative stress in liver cells. Overexpressed lsAg accumulates in the endoplasmic reticulum, inducing
high levels of oxidative endoplasmic reticulum stress and thus
causes oxidative DNA damage and genomic instability (9, 10).
In addition, previous studies have indicated that HBx protein
directly interacts with mitochondrial membrane proteins and
alters mitochondrial transmembrane potential in liver cells (11).
Waris et al. further showed that, as a consequence of the
association of protein with the mitochondria, HBx constitutively
activates transcriptional factors STAT-3 and nuclear factor-nB via
oxidative stress (12). The levels of intrahepatic mitochondrial ROS
and lipid peroxide production are thus increased in hepatoma cell
lines and transgenic mice expressing HBx protein. This indicates
that oxidative injury occurs as a direct result of HBx expression
(13). Accordingly, the induction of oxidative stress by these two
viral proteins contributes to the liver pathogenesis associated with
HBV infection (14) and, thus, can provide an experimental model
for the investigation of antioxidant therapy.
Antioxidants are used to counteract the reactivity of ROS. The
cellular oxidative stress can, therefore, be resolved by antioxidants.
Silymarin, extracted mainly from the seeds of milk thistle (Silybum
marianum), is a naturally derived polyphenolic flavonoid with
hepatoprotective and antihepatotoxic properties (15). Silymarin is
composed of five major flavonolignans: silybinin, isosilybinin,
silychristin, silydianin, and taxifoline. Silybinin is the major
component of silymarin, and many people have regarded this
component as the most biologically active constituent of silymarin
(16, 17). Silymarin, the mixture of flavonolignans, is a very widely
used herbal medicine and dietary supplement in the treatment of
alcoholic liver disease, acute and chronic viral hepatitis, and toxininduced liver damage (18). As such, the effectiveness of silymarin as
a treatment is highly important. Previous studies have indicated

that silymarin has strong antioxidative properties and acts as a
free radical scavenger reducing free radicals, ROS, and lipid
peroxidation in patients with alcoholic cirrhosis (19). Similar
results have been found with diethylnitrosamine and ethanolinduced hepatotoxicity in rodents (20–22). Extensive analysis has
shown that silymarin can suppress cancer cell proliferation and has
anticarcinogenic effects on a range of cancers, such as prostate,
breast, skin, colon, and bladder cancers, using cancer cell lines,
xenograft, or carcinogen-induced tumors in rodents (23). However,
although silymarin has been used in the treatment of liver diseases
for a long time, its anticarcinogenic effects on HCC have not yet
been well studied.
In the present study, we investigate the chemopreventive and
therapeutic effects of silymarin on the hepatocarcinogenesis using
the HBx transgenic mouse model, which was previously established
in our laboratory. HBx transgenic mice spontaneously develop
HCC at 13 to 16 months of age. The HCC developed in the HBx
transgenic mice exhibits a well-differentiated morphology of the
trabecular pattern. Fibrosis, bizarre nuclei, cytoplasmic lipid
droplets and hyaline globules can be observed in the HBx-induced
HCC samples similar to those observed in human HCC (24). The
HBx transgenic mice thus provide an animal model for evaluating
chemopreventive and new therapeutic agents for HCC under
physiologic conditions.

Results

Materials and Methods
HBx transgenic mice. There are four lines of HBx transgenic mice,
namely A105, A106, A110, and A112, that were generated in our laboratory
in the C57BL/6 background (24). All of the HBx transgenic lines develop
HCC. The chemoprevention experiments used male mice of the line A106,
and the results were confirmed using the line A110. All of the mice were
housed in a specific pathogen-free facility. All of the animal protocols are
consistent with the recommendations outlined in the ‘‘Guide for the Care
and Use of Laboratory Animals’’ (NIH publication 86-23 revised 1985) and
strictly follow the rules issued by Institutional Animal Care and Use
Committees of National Yang-Ming University.
Silymarin administration. Silymarin (Sigma) was dissolved in 0.5%
sodium carboxymethylcellulose (Sigma). Various doses of silymarin, including 0 (carboxymethylcellulose vehicle control), 30, 100, and 300 mg/kg/d,
were delivered to the mice daily through p.o. administration using a feeding
needle. To study the therapeutic effects of the treatments on the early stage
of liver pathogenesis, 4-wk-old HBx transgenic male mice and their wildtype male littermates were randomly assigned into different groups.
Mice were sacrificed at 7 and 14 d after silymarin administration. To study
the therapeutic effects of the treatments on the precancerous stage of
liver carcinogenesis, 13-mo-old HBx transgenic male mice and their wildtype male littermates were used. Mice were p.o. given with silymarin
(300 mg/kg/d) daily. Mice were sacrificed at 16-mo-old after silymarin
administration for 3 mo. Liver tissues and sera were collected for pathologic
and biochemical analysis.
Pathologic analysis. The number and size of liver nodules were
measured at mouse sacrifice. Histopathologic and ultrastructural changes
were examined by light and electron microscopy. The livers were collected,
fixed with formalin, and embedded in paraffin. Liver sections were
subjected to H&E staining (25). Ultrastructural changes in the liver were
examined by transmission electron microscopy (TEM; ref. 26).
Alanine aminotransferase assay. Blood samples were obtained at
various stages of the silymarin treatment. Serum alanine aminotransferase
(ALT) values were analyzed by DRI-CHEM 3500s (FUJIFILM).
Intracellular ROS and glutathione levels. Primary hepatocytes were
isolated from mouse livers using the two-step collagenase perfusion method
(27). Intracellular ROS levels were determined by the use of an oxidativesensitive fluorescence dye, dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (DCF-DA;
Molecular Probes). Primary hepatocytes (1  106) were incubated with

Cancer Res 2008; 68: (6). March 15, 2008

DCF-DA in PBS, washed, and resuspended in PBS. The intensities of
fluorescence in cells were analyzed using the FACS Vantage system at a
wavelength of 526 nm. Intracellular glutathione levels were determined
using a cell-permeable nonfluorescent dye monochlorobimane (Molecular
Probes) that becomes highly fluorescent after reaction with intracellular
glutathione. Primary hepatocytes (1  106) were incubated with monochlorobimane in PBS, washed, and resuspended in PBS. The intensities of
fluorescence in cells were analyzed using a spectofluorometer with an
excitation wavelength of 390 nm and emission wavelength of 460 nm.
RNA analysis. Total RNA was isolated from mouse tissues using TRIzol
reagent (Life Technology). Slot blot hybridization was performed, as
previously described (28). The hybridization signal was standardized against
the intensity of the 28S rRNA. Real-time quantitative reverse transcription–
PCR (RT-PCR) was performed using the Assays-on-Demand Gene
Expression Product System from Applied Biosystems.
Immunohistochemistry. Immunohistochemistry detection of the HBx
protein was performed using HBx polyclonal antibody (24). Monoclonal
Ki67 antibody (B56) was purchased from BD PharMingen. Paraffinembedded liver sections (3 Am) were incubated with the primary antibody
and detected with a LSABTM kit (DakoCytomation) according to the
manufacturer’s instructions.
Statistical analysis. Results are presented as mean F SD from at least
three independent experiments. Differences among multiple groups were
analyzed by a one-way ANOVA (SPSS 14.0 statistical software). Comparisons
between two groups were done using a Student’s t test. A P value of <0.05
was considered significant.

Silymarin exerted beneficial effects on the early stages of
liver damage and fatty changes. The animal protocol for
silymarin treatment is shown in Fig. 1A. Without any treatment,
at an early stage of the HBx-mediated liver pathogenesis, namely
4 to 6 weeks of age, liver degeneration including fatty changes
(microsteatosis), pleomorphic and bizarre nuclei, ballooning of
the hepatocytes, and abnormal arrangement of the sinusoid are
detectable in the HBx transgenic mice (Fig. 1B). Interestingly, p.o.
administration of silymarin of various doses (0, 30, 100, and 300
mg/kg/d) from 4 to 6 weeks of age reduced liver damage and
regressed the histopathology of the HBx transgenic mice in a dosedependent manner (Fig. 1C). The HBx transgenic livers recovered
to normal morphology, with either a high dose of silymarin
(300 mg/kg/d) treatment for 7 days (Fig. 1C, a–c) or a low dose
of silymarin (30 mg/kg/d) treatment for 14 days (Fig. 1C, d–f )
compared with the wild-type control (Fig. 1C, g–i). The mean values
of serum ALT observed for both wild-type and HBx transgenic mice
are all in the basal level range (20–50 units/L) at this early stage. No
obvious difference in the serum ALT values was detected in both
HBx transgenic and wild-type mice with or without silymarin
treatment (Supplementary Fig. S1), indicating that silymarin has no
toxic effect on liver. Thus, our results showed that silymarin
exerted therapeutic effects at an early stage of liver pathogenesis in
the HBx transgenic mice.
Silymarin regressed liver histopathology and prevented HCC
formation during the precancerous stage of HBx-mediated
carcinogenesis. Because silymarin was found to have therapeutic
effect on the early stage of liver pathogenesis, we further tested the
preventive and/or therapeutic effects of silymarin on the later stage
of HBx-mediated liver carcinogenesis. Silymarin (300 mg/kg/d) was
p.o. given to HBx transgenic (line A106) and wild-type mice from
13 to 16 months of age. At 13 months of age, the HBx transgenic
mice can be divided into two groups: one group (21 mice) had
precancerous stage liver pathology and a low serum ALT value, and
the other group (seven mice) had already developed HCC and

development in the HBx transgenic mice (line A106) at 16 months
of age without any treatment (24). Interestingly, our results here
showed that the serum ALT values (a measure of liver damage)
did not increase over the period of treatment with silymarin
(Fig. 2A) and that there was no HCC detected in any of the 21
precancerous mice at 16 months of age after silymarin treatment
for 3 months (Fig. 2C). No grossly identifiable nodules could be
detected in 14% (3 of 21) of the precancerous mice, whereas 81%
(17 of 21) of these mice contained small (0.5–2.5 mm) hyperplastic
nodules. Out of all the precancerous mice, only one (of 21; 5%)
contained a hyperplastic nodule that was later pathologically
confirmed as a benign tumor, measuring 5 mm in diameter (Fig.
2C). Histologic examination of these liver sections further
confirmed that silymarin administration did indeed cause a
regression of the liver morbid morphology and prevented
abnormal histopathology in the HBx transgenic mice (Supplementary Fig. S2).
Silymarin is unable to block cancer progression after
notable HCC nodule formation. For the mice with notable
HCC nodule formation at 13 months of age, a relatively high-serum
ALT value (171.8 F 199.6, n = 7) was detected (Fig. 3A), indicating
significant liver damage. To test whether silymarin has therapeutic
effects on liver carcinogenesis after HCC formation, silymarin
(300 mg/kg/d) was p.o. given to these HBx transgenic mice (line
A106) from 13 to 16 months of age. The serum ALT values gradually
increased over the period of treatment (Fig. 3A) and the HCC
nodules progressed to a larger size after 3 months of silymarin

treatment (Fig. 3B and C). These results indicated that silymarin
has neither preventive nor therapeutic effects on liver carcinogenesis after notable HCC nodule formation.
Hepatocyte ultrastructure was significantly recovered after
silymarin treatment. To study the efficacy of silymarin on
hepatocytes ultrastructure, transgenic livers with 2 weeks of
silymarin treatment (300 mg/kg/d) from 4 to 6 weeks of age were
examined by TEM. In the wild-type mice, no ultrastructural
abnormality was detected after treatment with vehicle for 2 weeks

(Fig. 4A). In the transgenic mice, without any treatment or treated
with vehicle for 2 weeks, severe ultrastructural alterations were
observed in the hepatocytes, including disorganization of rough
endoplasmic reticulum, degeneration of mitochondria, and detection of myelin figures, which are the membranous debris of
mitochondrion degeneration (Fig. 4B). After treatment with
silymarin for 2 weeks, all the ultrastructural abnormalities were
absent (Fig. 4C and D). Quantification further supported the
recovery of mitochondrial volume density among the transgenic

HBx gene expression was not inhibited by silymarin. To
investigate whether HBx gene expression is affected by silymarin
and whether this might contribute to the regression of morbid
liver pathology after silymarin administration, the HBx mRNA and
protein expression levels were detected by slot blot hybridization

and immunohistochemistry staining of liver sections, respectively.
Our data revealed that expression of the HBx gene was not
inhibited by silymarin either at an early stage (4–6 weeks of age) or
at a precancerous stage (13–16 months of age) of the HBx
transgenic mice (Fig. 5A).

cell proliferation and liver regeneration were affected by silymarin,
the Ki67 cell proliferation marker was examined by immunohistochemistry staining of liver sections prepared from 4-week-old to
5-week-old mice with silymarin treatment for 3 and 7 days. Our data
indicated that Ki67-positive cells were obviously increased after
silymarin administration (Fig. 5B and C). Quantification revealed
that after silymarin treatment for 3 days, there was a 9-fold
(transgenic mice treated with 30 mg/kg/d silymarin, 9.37 F 1.3%)
and 12-fold (transgenic mice treated with 300 mg/kg/d silymarin,
12.21 F 5.0%) increase in the number of Ki67-positive hepatocytes
of the HBx transgenic mice compared with the untreated transgenic
mice (1.01 F 0.74%; Fig. 5D). After silymarin treatment for 7 days,
there was a 4-fold (transgenic mice treated with 30 mg/kg/d
silymarin, 4.44 F 0.98%) and 11-fold (transgenic mice treated with
300 mg/kg/d silymarin, 10.8 F 2.22%) increase in the number of
Ki67-positive hepatocytes of the HBx transgenic mice compared
with the untreated transgenic mice (1.01 F 0.74%; Fig. 5D). In wildtype mice, hepatocyte cell proliferation was not affected after
silymarin treatment for 3 days, but there was a lower but significant
stimulation after silymarin treatment for 7 days (Fig. 5D). These
results suggested that the enhanced cell proliferation and liver
regeneration induced by silymarin help to replace damaged cells in
the HBx transgenic mice and this may contribute in part to the
chemopreventive effect of silymarin on liver pathogenesis.
Silymarin treatment caused a dose-dependent decrease in
the ROS levels. To study the antioxidative effect of silymarin on
liver redox status, the intracellular ROS levels of the hepatocytes
were monitored. Elevated level of ROS was detected at an early
stage (5 weeks of age) of HBx-mediated liver carcinogenesis (Supplementary Fig. S3). The level of intracellular ROS in hepatocytes
was even higher at 13.5 months of age (Supplementary Fig. S3).
Our data clearly indicated that there are persistently increased
levels of ROS during liver carcinogenesis of the HBx transgenic
mice. The intracellular ROS levels of hepatocytes were examined at
6 weeks of age after 2 weeks of various doses (carboxymethylcellulose vehicle control, 30, 100, and 300 mg/kg/d) of silymarin
treatment. Our results for two independent HBx transgenic lines,
A106 and A110, clearly showed that silymarin, indeed, can
efficiently reduce intracellular ROS levels in a dose-dependent
manner under physiologic conditions (Fig. 6A).
Differential expression of enzymes related to glutathione
metabolism and liver functions after silymarin treatment. RNA
samples from 6-week-old HBx transgenic and wild-type mice with
or without silymarin (300 mg/kg/d) treatment for 2 weeks were
systematically compared for changes in gene expression by
Affymetrix microarray. Genes related to antioxidation and liver
functions were identified based on KEGG pathway database.7
Previous reports indicated that silymarin exhibits antioxidant
activity partly through restoration of intracellular glutathione levels
and activation of antioxidation-related enzymes involved in druginduced and carcinogen-induced hepatotoxicity (20, 29, 30).
Indeed, the intracellular glutathione levels of hepatocytes were
significantly increased after silymarin treatment (Fig. 6B). Furthermore, our real-time quantitative RT-PCR analysis revealed that
transcripts of the enzymes involved in the glutathione metabolism,
such as isocitrate dehydrogenase 2 (Idh2), Gstt2, Gsto1, Gstk1, and
Mgst3, were up-regulated by silymarin (Fig. 6C). Genes involved in

the glutamate metabolism (e.g., Got1, Gpt1, Gpt2, and Gls2), citrate
cycle (e.g., Idh3a, Acly, Mdh2, and Fh1), and urea cycle (e.g., Asl
and Arg1) were also up-regulated (Fig. 6C). All three of these
pathways are indirectly related to the level of glutathione (Fig. 6D).
Thus, the combined effects of the multiple pathway changes were
related directly or indirectly to glutathione metabolism and liver
functions, and these may all contribute to the reversion of liver
pathophysiology and chemopreventive effect of silymarin on
spontaneous carcinogenesis of HCC in the HBx transgenic mice.

Discussion
The potential benefits of silymarin in the clinical treatment of
liver diseases remained a controversial issue. Our current studies
provide in vivo evidence demonstrating that silymarin has
therapeutic effects on the early stages of liver damage, involving
the reversal of fatty changes and a regression of the liver morbid
histopathology. Silymarin is composed mainly of silibinin and
smaller amounts of a number of other steroisomers (16). The
silymarin used in the present study contains 55.1% silibinin, as
analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography (data not
shown). Previous studies have indicated comparable effects for
silymarin and silybinin on the antioxidative properties and growth
inhibition of cancer cells (17, 31, 32). It is not clear at present
whether one, more than one, or various combinations of silymarin
components are the active agent of the in vivo efficacy of the
mixture. We are currently working on the purification of individual
components that are not commercially available, such as isosilybinin, silychristin, and silydianin from silymarin. Based on the
results presented here showing that the mixture present in
silymarin is active, it is important to test the efficacy of individual
components and their different combinations using the HBx
transegnic mouse model to study their individual chemopreventive
effect on spontaneous HCC. The widespread medical use of
silymarin as a chemopreventive agent creates a need to identify the
active ingredient(s) of this useful mixture flavonolignans.
Regarding the antioxidative and radical scavenging properties,
in addition to silybinin, there are other active constituents of
silymarin, such as silydianin that can act as a free radical scavenger.
On treatment with silydianin, decreased superoxide radical release
in activated neutrophils, and lipid peroxidation in mouse spleen
microsomes has been reported (33). Sersen et al. reported that
silymarin, silychristin, and silydianin exhibit relatively good
antioxidant ability against phenylglyoxylic ketyl radicals. The most
effective scavengers of these free radicals were silymarin and
silychristin, whereas silybinin was ineffective (34). The combined
effectiveness of multiple antioxidants during the chemoprevention
and therapy of the liver pathology may explain the efficacy of
silymarin, which is a mixture of flavonolignans, including silychristin, silydianin, silybinin, and isosilybinin. It is possible that due to the
variation in the free radical scavenging properties of the chemicals
making up silymarin, the mixture may have synergic properties.
In the present study, we have shown that there are persistently
increased levels of ROS during hepatocarcinogenesis of the HBx
transgenic mice (Supplementary Fig. S3), and this may damage
protein, DNA, and RNA leading to chronic cell death and induce
liver regeneration. In addition, our previous study revealed that
HBx protein blocks G1-S transition of hepatocyte cell cycle
progression in the regenerating liver of the HBx transgenic mice
(24). Accordingly, chronic hepatocyte cell death may cause
repeated local liver repair leading to the acquisition of mutations

of Idh2 facilitates the generation of NADPH and conversion of glutathione from oxidized to reduced form. Increase of reduced glutathione further facilitates the removal
of H2O2 from cells. Up-regulation of several glutathione S -transferases (Gstt2, Gsto1, Gstk1, and Mgst3), which are involved in the metabolism of xenobiotic
compounds, enhances the catalysis of conjugation of reduced glutathione to a wide variety of electrophilic substrates (RX organic compounds carrying a sulfate, nitrile, or
halide group), leading to higher levels of water-soluble and removable derivatives. The urea cycle enzymes, Asl and Arg1, were up-regulated after silymarin treatment.
These two enzymes will facilitate the generation of fumarate and urea. Fumarate further enters the citrate cycle and, together with the up-regulated levels of citrate
cycle enzymes Fh1, Mdh2, Acly, Idh2, and Idh3a, leads to increased level of 2-oxoglutarate. The up-regulation of Got1, Gpt1, and Gpt2 further enhances the conversion of
2-oxoglutarate to glutamate and indirectly links to the glutathione metabolism. Mgst3, microsomal glutathione S-transferase 3; Gsto1, glutathione S -transferase N1;

and enhancement of hepatocarcinogenesis. The present animal
study clearly showed that silymarin can efficiently reduce
intracellular ROS levels of hepatocytes, thus preventing oxidative
stress-induced cellular damage. Furthermore, hepatocyte cell

for 3 and 7 days, suggesting that enhanced liver regeneration may
help replace the damaged liver cells and contribute, at least in part,
to the chemopreventive effect of silymarin.

Chemoprevention of Silymarin in HBx Transgenic Mice

Silymarin have been shown to inhibit cell growth and DNA
synthesis in many types of cancer cells using mostly cell culture
system (35, 36). However, the correlations between in vitro and
in vivo systems have always been controversial. It is not clear
whether some of the phenomena observed in simple cell culture
systems can be related to what actually occurs in vivo under
physiologic conditions. In addition, cell lines established from
cancers with an accumulation of various genetic mutations and
epigenetic alternations that cause uncontrolled cell proliferation
may affect the response of cells to silymarin treatment when
compared with noncancerous or precancerous cells when studied
in a spontaneous hepatocarcinogenic animal model.
Regarding the anticarcinogenic effect of silymarin on HCC,
previously, Varghese et al. reported the efficacy of silybinin against
two human HCC cell lines (37). In their study, silybinin strongly
inhibited growth of both Hep G2 and Hep 3B cells. Silybinin also
caused G1 arrest in Hep G2 and both G1 and G2-M arrest in Hep 3B
cells. Mechanistic studies revealed that silybinin induced Kip/p27
but decreased cell cycle–associated gene expression (37). Our in vivo
efficacy study using the mouse model indicated that silymarin
possesses effective cancer-preventive effects on spontaneous HCC
and affords strong anticarcinogenic effects before HCC formation.
However, silymarin is unable to block HCC progression and inhibit
cancer cell proliferation after accumulation of multiple irreversible
genetic alternations/mutations in vivo. A similar animal study using
silymarin involving stage-specific phenomenon has been reported
for a mouse skin carcinogenesis model (38, 39). Agarwal’s group
reported that the anticancer effect of silymarin is primarily targeted
against stage I tumor promotion in mouse skin with significant
inhibition of TPA-induced lipid peroxidation. In terms of any
preventive effect on stage II tumor promotion, silymarin shows only
a very limited effect on the tumor incidence of carcinogen-induced
skin cancers (38, 39). In the N-nitrosodiethylamine (NDEA)–induced
hepatocarcinogenesis model, low effectiveness was observed in
rats posttreated with silymarin after administration of NDEA for
10 weeks compared with rats pretreated with silymarin in terms of
the number and size of the HCC tumors (40), suggesting that
silymarin may not block/inhibit the later stages of HCC progression.
Previous studies have revealed that HBV infection is associated
with an increased production of ROS within the liver and that this
is responsible for the oxidation of intracellular molecules and
activation of genes related to oxidative stress. Valgimigli et al.
reported that ROS levels in HBV chronic hepatitis patients were
higher than in healthy controls by radical probe electron
paramagnetic resonance measurements of human liver biopsy
specimens (41). In addition, induction of HBV replication in human
hepatoma HepAD38 cells, in which HBV production is under the

control of a tetracycline-regulated promoter, led to up-regulation of
genes related to oxidative stress (42). The fact that the liver
histopathology (Fig. 1C) and ROS levels (Fig. 6A) were decreased in
a dose-dependent manner in the silymarin-treated HBx transgenic
mice provides solid evidences for the antioxidative function of
silymarin during HBV-associated pathogenesis. Our real-time
quantitative RT-PCR analysis revealed that the molecular mechanism of silymarin-mediated antioxidative effect may involve genes
related directly or indirectly to glutathione metabolism (Fig. 6C
and D). Up-regulation of Idh2 facilitates the generation of NADPH
and conversion of glutathione from its oxidized to its reduced
form. The increase in reduced glutathione further facilitates the
removal of H2O2 from cells. In addition, up-regulation of several
glutathione S-transferases (Gstt2, Gsto1, Gstk1, and Mgst3), whose
functions are involved in the conjugation reaction of glutathione to
diverse electrophilic substrates, reveals the presence of a higher
concentration of reduced glutathione. In addition, genes upregulated by silymarin and involved in the glutamate metabolism,
urea cycle, and citrate cycle may all indirectly contribute to the
increase of glutathione level and reversion of liver pathophysiology.
Milk thistle is the dietary supplement taken most frequently by
patients with chronic liver diseases. This supplement is one of the
most widely used herbal medicines and has been for a long time.
Both milk thistle and its active ingredient silymarin are
pharmacologically safe and well tolerated (23, 43, 44). The present
study further provides in vivo evidence demonstrating that
silymarin is a safe and effective antioxidant drug in an animal
model system. Furthermore, the fact that silymarin effectively
regresses morbid liver pathology and recovers liver structure and
hepatocyte ultrastructure, as well as prevents and delays HBxmediated carcinogenesis, suggests that silymarin is a potential
chemopreventive agent for HBV-related hepatocarcinogenesis. The
effectiveness of the mixture of flavonolignans known as silymarin
on HCC prevention as modeled using HBx transgenic mice in this
study is an important step forward in identifying how and why
silymarin works.
