Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy for Carcinoma of
the Breast

BACKGROUND: The timing and accuracy of axillary sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) in patients who are receiving
neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) for breast cancer are controversial. To examine the accuracy of SLNB after NACT,
the authors performed SLNB after chemotherapy on all of patients who received NACT at their institution starting in
January 1997. METHODS: Seventy-nine women who underwent NACT between 1997 and 2008 comprised this study
and were divided as follows: 4 women had stage I disease, 60 women had stage II disease, and 15 women had stage
III disease, including 10 women who had multicentric disease. Thirty-nine women (49.4%) had clinical evidence of axillary metastasis (N1-N2) at the time of diagnosis. The regimen, the duration of treatment, and the number of cycles of
NACT depended on clinical response. The choice of breast conservation therapy or mastectomy was based on the
patient’s response to treatment and patient preference. All patients underwent SLNB after NACT. RESULTS: Seventythree patients underwent breast conservation therapy, and 6 patients underwent mastectomy. Sentinel lymph
nodes were identified in 98.7% of patients (in 1 patient, SLNB failed to capture 1 proven axillary metastasis), and 29
patients underwent full axillary lymph node dissection. Fourteen patients (17.7%) had no residual carcinoma (invasive
or ductal carcinoma in situ) in their breast, 5 patients (6.3%) had residual ductal carcinoma in situ (only), and
60 patients (75.9%) had residual invasive carcinoma. One false-negative SLNB was reported in the group of 23
patients who underwent full axillary dissection after a negative SLNB. No patient had a subsequent axillary recurrence. CONCLUSIONS: SLNB after NACT was feasible in virtually all patients and accurately selected patients who
required complete level I and II axillary dissection. NACT frequently downstaged the axilla, converting patients with
N1-N2 lymph node status to N0 status and also avoiding full axillary dissection in these patients. Cancer

Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) has become the international standard technique for the axillary staging of
patients who have primary, operable (T1, T2, and selected T3), clinically lymph node-negative (N0) carcinoma of the
breast.1 An expert panel of the American Society of Clinical Oncology in 2005 stated that SLNB assessed axillary lymph
node status with acceptable accuracy for a wide range of patients with early stage breast cancer.2 If the SLNB is negative,
then it can be presumed that the remainder of the axilla is disease-free, so that SLNB is equivalent to traditional level I and
II axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) in accurately staging the axilla and minimizing axillary local recurrence.3,4
Patients who have histologically negative SLNB alone, without further axillary surgery, have the same long-term outcomes with less morbidity and better functional outcomes than patients who undergo ALND.5 The removal of negative
lymph nodes provides no significant benefit. In addition to reduced morbidity, SLNB costs less, takes less time to perform,
and is more likely to be performed on an outpatient basis than complete ALND.
However, considerable variability has been reported in the false-negative rate and the failure to identify sentinel
lymph nodes, emphasizing the importance of the learning curve for the SLNB procedure.2 What constitutes appropriate
training in the technique of SLNB has been addressed in numerous publications.1,2,3,5

Original Article

Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) represents the
use of cytotoxic therapy as the first modality of treatment
for a primary malignant tumor to downstage the primary
tumor.6 Regression of the primary tumor documents its
in vivo sensitivity to chemotherapy; NACT also may permit the subsequent excision of the primary lesion with
clear surgical margins, so that patients who have locally
advanced breast cancer may become eligible for breast
conservation therapy (BCT).7
NACT also may clear the axilla of lymph node metastases in some patients. Significant residual lymph node
metastasis after NACT has powerful prognostic value.8-10
Whether NACT affects long-term survival remains contentious, but patients who achieve a complete pathologic
responses apparently have better disease-free survival.6
The optimal strategy for incorporating lymphatic
mapping into NACT regimens has not been clearly
defined.11,12 Opinions differ considerably with respect to
the timing of SLNB in patients who are receiving NACT,
ie, before13-16 or after.17-26 The American Society of Clinical Oncology expert panel concluded that there were
insufficient data to recommend SLNB or to suggest the
appropriate timing of SLNB for patients who are receiving preoperative systemic chemotherapy.2
We and others contend that NACT extends the possibility of BCT without sacrificing accurate axillary staging.27,28 Advocates of SLNB after NACT maintain that
the technique is reliable and provides patients who have
converted from lymph node-positive status to lymph
node-negative status an alternative to complete ALND.
Recommendations for SLNB before NACT generally are underpinned by the argument that post-treatment SLNB has a higher risk of failure to identify the
‘‘true’’ sentinel lymph node and an increased false-negative rate. However, we believe that SLNB after NACT is
as accurate as SLNB before NACT; moreover, SLNB
before NACT does not take advantage of the downstaging effect of NACT on axillary lymph nodes. Patients
with positive pre-NACT sentinel lymph nodes traditionally would be committed to completion ALND after
NACT; therefore, at least traditionally, this approach
commits the patient to 2 procedures irrespective of the
final sentinel lymph node status. Confirming lymph
node status before NACT, however, is of minimal value
once the decision to use NACT has been made (usually
on clinical grounds), whereas SLNB after NACT provides information regarding residual lymph node disease
that has greater prognostic importance and may guide
additional therapy.17,20,26

1244

The objective of the current study was to address 2
concerns regarding SLNB after NACT by reviewing 1 surgeon’s experience with SLNB performed after NACT in
79 patients between January 1997, and September 2008.
This study was reviewed and approved by the institutional
review board.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
From January 1, 1997, through September 30, 2008, 79
patients who received NACT underwent SLNB after they
completed NACT. All of these women were patients of
the senior author (G.F.S.), a surgeon who specializes in
diseases of the breast. The majority of patients presented
with stage II breast cancer, tumors that measured >3.0
cm, or stage III breast cancer; tumor characteristics at diagnosis are summarized in Table 1. Axillary lymph node
status was determined by clinical examination; patients
had clinical N0-N2 axillae before chemotherapy. Axillary
biopsy was not required to assess axillary status except in 2
patients who presented with T0N1-N2 findings. The decision to use NACT was based on findings in the breast
except for these 2 patients. In our own practice, based on
an internal review of our past data from complete axillary
dissections (levels I, II, and III) performed during mastectomy, we have documented a 90% clinical accuracy rate
(positive predictive value [PPV]) when we have called the
axilla positive. However, 7 patients did have biopsy-proven axillary metastases before they received NACT,
including the 2 patients who presented with T0N1-N2
cancers; 2 patients who presented after undergoing axillary biopsy or fine-needle aspiration performed elsewhere;
and 3 patients who underwent axillary fine-needle aspiration to confirm the presence of metastatic disease before
they would agree to NACT. The diagnosis of invasive carcinoma of the breast was confirmed by fine-needle aspiration, core biopsy, or excision of the breast lesion. The
‘‘excisional’’ biopsies had been performed elsewhere
before we initially saw the patient. In these patients,
NACT recommendations were made based on clinical
records and pathology slides and on reports retrieved
from other institutions and reviewed by us. All patients
underwent initial metastatic evaluation to rule out stage
IV disease.
Next, patients were referred to a medical oncologist
for the initiation of an NACT regimen. The NACT regimens used in this study are detailed in Table 1. Serial clinical examinations were performed by the senior author to
assess response. Mammograms and occasional magnetic

resonance imaging studies also were used selectively.
Once a complete clinical remission had been achieved or
the planned NACT regimen had been completed, definitive surgical treatment was recommended. Early in this
study, the number of cycles used was variable, because we
tried to achieve a plateau of response; however, since
2003, the maximum number of cycles has been 8 (with 2
exceptions). The median number of cycles was 6.
At the completion of NACT, a surgical recommendation was made based on response to treatment, ie, BCT
or mastectomy. In general, BCT was used when the resid-

ual tumor was small enough to be excised with a clear
margin and with an acceptable cosmetic result. If the residual tumor was too large or the breast was too small,
then mastectomy was recommended.
SLNB was performed to assess axillary status in all
patients, either at the start of the mastectomy or, in
patients who underwent BCT, after there was histologic
proof of the successful local excision of the residual carcinoma. Three milliliters of isosulfan blue dye (1%) were
injected into the patient’s breast with at least 1 mL
injected intradermally and the rest injected into the parenchyma of the breast, peritumorally but outside the biopsy
cavity. During a brief period when isosulfan blue was
unavailable, 5 mL methylene blue dye were used instead.
Either dye injection was followed by 4 to 7 minutes of
massage. Clinical assessment by the senior author, location of the primary tumor, and the patient’s body mass
index determined variations in massage time. Early in the
study, 5 patients also were mapped with technetium-99
radioisotope, but our success with blue dye alone (>98%)
in identifying sentinel lymph nodes allowed the remaining patients to be mapped with blue dye alone.
The skin incision was made in a skin fold in the
lower one-third of the hair-bearing area of the ipsilateral
axilla, starting behind the edge of the pectoralis major
muscle and ending in front of the latissimus dorsi muscle.
Efferent, blue-stained lymphatic channel(s) were identified and traced to sentinel lymph nodes, defined as any
blue-stained lymph node package into which a blue lymphatic vessel drained. If a contiguous, nonstained lymph
node was identified, then it also was excised. The senior
surgeon personally prosected the specimen in the surgical
pathology laboratory to retrieve the sentinel lymph node,
and a dedicated technician prepared each frozen section
(FS). Patients also had their specimens stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) and cytokeratin after formalin
fixation.
Before 2003, because we were in the ‘‘learning
curve’’ of SLNB after NACT, all patients underwent completion ALND. After we were satisfied with our accuracy
in the identification of sentinel lymph nodes, only those
patients who had positive sentinel lymph nodes underwent ALND. In all patients, the sentinel lymph nodes and
the residual axillary specimens were processed separately.

RESULTS
Between 1997 and 2008, 79 women were enrolled in the
current study. Patient characteristics are listed in Table 1.

1245

Original Article

The median age at presentation was 55 years (range, 3377 years). Fifty-three women (67.1%) presented with T2
tumors, 10 women (12.6%) presented with T3 tumors,
and 6 women presented with T4 tumors (7.6%). The 4
patients with T1 tumors had more than 1 tumor in the
breast, and their tumor classification was defined by the
size of the largest tumor. Thirty-nine patients (49.4%)
presented with palpable axillary lymph nodes that were
considered clinically involved by tumor; 31 of those 39
patients had clinical N1 status, and 8 of those 39 patients
had clinical N2 status.
All patients received cyclic chemotherapy given every 2 or 3 weeks. From 3 to 17 cycles of NACT were
administered. Chemotherapy details are listed in Table 1.
After the completion of NACT in these 79 patients,
the clinical response of 7 patients could not be determined
because they had undergone an initial (unsuccessful)
attempt at excising the primary tumor. Of the remaining
72 patients, 12 patients (16.7%) had a complete clinical
response, which was defined as complete disappearance of
the primary tumor on physical (and radiologic) examination. Fifty-two patients (72.9%) had a partial clinical
response, which was defined as a decrease 30% in the
greatest tumor dimension. Eight patients (11.4%) had a
decrease <30% in their greatest tumor dimension.
After NACT, the clinical lymph node status of 75
patients was documented. One patient had an equivocal
lymph node status, 2 patients had no documentation of
post-NACT lymph node status in their chart, and 1
patient’s lymph node status could not be assessed because
of scar tissue from a previous axillary procedure. Of the
remaining 75 patients who had clinical measurement of
lymph node status after NACT, 62 patients (82.7%) had
clinically negative lymph nodes, 10 patients (13.3%) had
clinically involved lymph nodes that measured <1 cm in
greatest dimension, and 3 patients (4%) had lymph nodes
that measured >1 cm.
Of the 39 patients who had clinically positive lymph
nodes (N1-N2) at presentation, the lymph node status after NACT in 2 patients was equivocal. Of the remaining
37 patients who initially had positive lymph nodes, 26
patients (70.3%) converted to clinically negative lymph
node status (N0), and 11 patients (29.7%) retained their
clinically positive lymph node status after NACT. After
chemotherapy, 12 of 79 patients (15.2%) were considered
‘‘complete clinical responders,’’ which we defined as having no clinical signs of disease in the breast or axilla.
All 79 patients underwent SLNB using blue dye; in
76 patients, isosulfan blue dye was used, and 3 patients

1246

were mapped with methylene blue. After SLNB, 29
patients underwent level I and II axillary dissection, either
because of a positive lymph node or during the ‘‘learning
curve’’ period mentioned above. Twenty-three patients
were in the learning curve of the study, so that each of
them underwent level I and II dissection after SLNB, irrespective of their sentinel lymph node findings on FS. All
patients underwent either local excision of the residual
carcinoma or mastectomy with microscopic examination
of tissue according to the College of American Pathologists protocol.29
Six patients underwent mastectomy because BCT
was untenable, including 3 women who had multicentric
carcinoma and 3 women in whom the residual tumor was
too large in relation to the size of the breast to use BCT
with a satisfactory cosmetic result. These patients underwent SLNB as the first step in mastectomy through a separate, small axillary incision and had intraoperative
examination (FS) of sentinel lymph nodes. We previously
documented our favorable experience with FS examination of sentinel lymph nodes.30
Fourteen patients (17.7%) had a complete pathologic response to NACT with no evidence of invasive or
in situ carcinoma in the specimen at the time of definitive
surgical treatment, 5 patients (6.3%) had residual ductal
carcinoma in situ only with no residual invasive carcinoma, and 60 patients (75.9%) had residual invasive carcinoma. There was a discrepancy in theses rates when
comparisons were made between clinical and pathologic
responses. Two patients who had partial clinical responses
actually did have microscopic complete responses. In those
patients, the residual palpable ‘‘disease’’ at the site was tissue reaction or scar formation after chemotherapy. The
final pathology for the remaining patients is noted in
Table 1.
Sentinel lymph nodes were identified in 78 of 79
patients, an identification rate of 98.7%. H&E staining of
formalin-fixed tissue was performed on all sentinel lymph
nodes. In the 78 successful SLNBs, a median of 3 sentinel
lymph nodes (range, 1-9 sentinel lymph nodes) were identified. Twenty-three SLNBs yielded at least 1 sentinel
lymph node that was positive for metastasis. Fifty-five
SLNBs were negative for metastatic disease.
A false-negative SLNB was defined as an SLNB that
was negative for metastases but had axillary lymph node
involvement documented either by further ALND or by
axillary recurrence of disease. There was 1 false-negative
(early) in this series in which 1 sentinel lymph node was
identified as negative for metastatic disease on H&E,

staining; however, on further ALND, 23 additional
lymph nodes were removed, including 2 that were positive
for metastatic disease (1 micrometastasis and 1 macrometastasis). Thus, among the patients who underwent completion dissection although they had negative sentinel
lymph nodes, SLNB failed to capture 1 of 12 patients
with proven axillary metastasis, yielding a negative predictive value (NPV) of 92.3% for the group that underwent
completion axillary dissection, defining false-negative in
this context as negative sentinel lymph nodes but positive
nonsentinel lymph nodes on completion dissection.
For the entire series of patients, specificity and PPV,
by default, were 100%, because sentinel lymph node
involvement, by definition, is lymph node involvement
regardless of the status of the remaining axilla. If the same
NPV were to be valid for the entire group that was valid
for the patients who underwent full axillary dissection
during the learning phase, then a truly negative SLNB
would have occurred in 51 of 55 patients who had negative sentinel lymph nodes.
Intraoperative FS was performed in 69 patients, and
the results were recorded to measure the accuracy of FS after NACT. On FS analysis, there were 52 negative SLNBs
and 15 positive SLNBs. Of 52 FS-negative patients, 49
patients were confirmed as negative on microscopic examination of formalin-fixed tissue, so the PPV for an FS that
was called negative was 93%. No patient had a false-positive FS. The sentinel lymph node was the only positive
lymph node in 6 of 18 patients with proven metastasis
who underwent completion ALND. All patients have
been followed by the senior author. At a median followup of 62 months, no patient has experienced an axillary
lymph node recurrence.

DISCUSSION
Although the sentinel lymph node may accurately reflect
axillary status before chemotherapy, there is only modest
evidence supporting the accuracy of SLNB after chemotherapy. In general, SLNB without accompanying level I
and II dissection has not been performed on patients with
clinical evidence of axillary lymph node disease (Nþ) at
diagnosis, even when the axillary status has been ‘‘downstaged’’ by treatment. Some authors regard the downstaging of clinically positive axillary lymph nodes to clinically
lymph node-negative disease by NACT as a contraindication to SLNB, invoking possible alteration of intramammary lymphatic drainage, potentially multiple obscured
and undetected sources of lymphatic drainage for larger

tumors, and possible nonuniform cytotoxic response of
axillary metastases.12,15,21,31,32 Critics of post-NACT
SLNB also have suggested that SLNB can no longer accurately assess axillary status. They allege that, although
NACT may eradicate micrometastases, it only reduces the
size of nonsentinel lymph node macrometastases. This
implies that, although SLNB correctly can identify axillary lymph node status in most patients after NACT,
some patients may be under staged because of nonuniform responses within sentinel lymph nodes and nonsentinel axillary lymph nodes.33 Supporting this position are
several studies that demonstrated an unacceptably high
false-negative rate when SLNB followed NACT (with
false-negative defined as a negative sentinel lymph node
but positive lymph nodes elsewhere in the axilla documented at completion dissection).3,11,34 However, these
allegations of treatment-related alterations in lymphatic
architecture, function, and reliability have not been confirmed.35 Statistical analysis is complicated by the small
sample sizes in published series.
The recommendation for NACT usually is made
based on clinical, patient, and tumor characteristics, not
on the proven microscopic status of the axillary lymph
nodes. Consequently, SLNB results contribute only minimally when the procedure is performed before NACT.9,26
Therefore, patients who have microscopically positive
sentinel lymph nodes pretreatment that respond completely to NACT would undergo needless completion
ALND.
The majority of patients do achieve significant
regression of both the primary tumor and axillary metastases, and clinical evidence of axillary lymph node involvement often is changed (ie, ‘‘downstaged,’’) by NACT.
Therefore, we believed that it was reasonable and appropriate to examine the role of SLNB in patients, almost
regardless of axillary status after NACT, but certainly in
those patients who had clinically negative lymph nodes
(N0) after NACT. The addition of ultrasound to the
assessment of the axilla has been suggested but has not yet
received universal acceptance.6,36 If ultrasound were used
with fine-needle aspiration biopsy of suspicious lymph
nodes to document the persistence of axillary metastasis
after NACT, then patients either could undergo traditional ALND without the preliminary step of SLNB (if
they had positive lymph nodes), or they still could
undergo SLNB to assess the response of proven lymph
node disease to NACT.37
Two crucial issues have been addressed in this study,
namely, whether sentinel lymph nodes can be identified

reliably after neoadjuvant chemotherapy and whether sentinel lymph nodes that are identified after NACT reliably
predict axillary lymph node status. With respect to the
first issue, we have achieved a detection rate of 98.7%. In
78 of 79 patients, blue dye identified at least 1 sentinel
lymph node. Currently, achieving a detection rate 90%
is suggested before surgeons who are learning the procedure perform SLNB without concurrent ALND.2,5
Table 2 summarizes other investigators’ results with
SLNB after induction chemotherapy. Other investigators
also reported detection rates of 77.6-97.6% after induction chemotherapy,23,38,39 as shown in Table 2. These
data and ours suggest that a detection rate 90% is
attainable.
Sentinel lymph node identification is considered a
function of surgeon experience.5,21 In the current study,
all sentinel lymph node biopsies were performed by 1
experienced surgeon. This differs from other studies in
which the experiences of multiple surgeons using multiple
techniques over a protracted period were combined. Breslin et al documented surgeon experience as an important
factor in sentinel lymph node identification and reported
improvements from 65% to 94% in their own identification rates over time.40
In our review of articles that detailed authors’ experience with SLNB before and after NACT, in general, the
authors who were been most critical of post-NACT
SLNB had smaller series of patients, and the articles were
dated earlier than those advocating post-NACT SLNB.
Whether the same observations and conclusions would be
warranted after a longer period of time and experience
with a greater number of patients is speculative. Our own

1248

observations and conclusions clearly were justified more
after we had performed 58 more surgeries.27
We have demonstrated clearly that sentinel lymph
node detection is feasible in patients after induction
chemotherapy. A review of the literature revealed the ability of other investigators to achieve detection rates >90%.
Therefore, we also conclude that NACT per se does not
affect the identification of sentinel lymph nodes.
Although the various techniques used for SLNB
usually are considered comparable, isosulfan blue dye was
the only method used in this series except for the few
patients who were treated when it was not available and
methylene blue was substituted and the initial 5 patients
for whom we used both dye and radiocolloid. Other
investigators have used various combinations of blue dye
and technetium-99 in intradermal, peritumoral, and subareolar injections.4,31,41,42 In all likelihood, surgeon experience and comfort with a particular technique is more
important than the technique itself with regard to sentinel
lymph node identification. Because the 98.7% detection
rate achieved in the current series was accomplished using
blue dye only after the first 5 patients, we cannot comment on the validity of other techniques in patients who
are receiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy. However, we
would expect the accuracy to be the same in the same
experienced hands, irrespective of the technique chosen.
The second issue we addressed was the accuracy of
SLNB. The technique is useful only if the histopathology
of the identified sentinel lymph node accurately reflects axillary lymph node status. The most significant failing of
SLNB is the false-negative finding in which the sentinel
lymph node is negative but metastases are present in other

axillary lymph nodes. SLNB false-negative rates after
chemotherapy ranged from 0% to 25%, as summarized in
Table 2. We encountered 1 such false-negative result in a
patient aged 45 years who presented initially with a T2N2
lesion. After 5 cycles of combined chemotherapy with doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide (AC), the primary tumor
appeared to regress completely, although axillary lymph
nodes remained palpable. After consultation with the medical oncology team, the patient received 3 additional cycles
of paclitaxel in an attempt to achieve axillary remission as
well. After this treatment, the axilla became clinically negative. SLNB identified 1 sentinel lymph node in the axilla.
Although the sentinel lymph node was negative for any
macroscopic or microscopic evidence of metastatic disease,
completion axillary dissection revealed that 2 of 23 lymph
nodes harbored metastatic invasive ductal carcinoma. This
failure may be attributable to the disparity in response
between the primary lesion and the axillary lymph nodes.
The chemotherapeutic regimen was altered, because the
axilla was refractory to cyclic AC therapy.
If the same NPV were to be valid for the entire
group that was valid for the patients who underwent full
axillary dissection during the learning phase, then a truly
negative SLNB would have occurred in 51 of the 55 sentinel lymph node-negative patients, as noted above. (If we
had gone directly to axillary dissection without the
attempt at SLNB in this 1 patient noted above, then our
NPV for 78 patients would have been 100%.) For the
entire series of patients, the PPV, by default, was 100%,
because sentinel lymph node involvement, by definition,
is lymph node involvement regardless of the status of the
remaining axilla.
Stearns et al reported 3 false-negative results, all in
patients who received paclitaxel.43 Whether this implies a
relation between the drug used and the failure to detect
axillary disease accurately is speculative but unlikely.
The published proceedings of a 2001 consensus conference devoted to SLNB proposed that surgeons should
conduct concomitant ALND until they achieve a falsenegative rate <5%.5 Other experts have proposed similar
cutoffs in the ongoing debate concerning SLNB learning
curves and accreditation. Cox et al suggest that surgeons
perform 20 sentinel lymph node biopsies with 1 falsenegative results before they discontinue using confirmatory axillary dissection.13
In reviewing the literature that addresses SLNB and
NACT, small sample size and its effect on outcome calculations are apparent. The 13 trials summarized in Table 2
averaged 98 patients (range, 30-428 patients). In our own

study, the small sample size was even more important,
because the false-negative rate was calculated based on the
number of patients who had residual disease in the axilla
after chemotherapy. In our experience, this was a single
patient who received a different course of treatment than
the others in our group. Our own results also challenge
the proposition that NACT should be considered a contraindication to SLNB, because at least 1 sentinel lymph
node was identified in all 79 patients.
The involved sentinel lymph node was the only
lymph node that contained metastatic disease in 6 of 18
patients (33.3%) who had biopsy-proven axillary involvement. Other series reported this observation in 17% to
46% of patients.13,42 Currently, the importance of this
observation is uncertain. Although this may simply reflect
the more careful processing to which the sentinel lymph
node is subjected, it validates the assumption that the sentinel lymph node accurately predicts the status of the
entire axilla. This finding also refutes the suggestion that
the sentinel lymph node may be ‘‘downstaged’’ preferentially by chemotherapy, yielding a high false-negative rate.
Further studies may elucidate the precise role of SLNB after induction chemotherapy, but the current results suggest that initial reports demonstrating an unacceptable
false-negative rate should not dissuade surgeons from
attempting SLNB under these circumstances. Experienced practitioners may detect the sentinel lymph node(s)
regardless of preoperative chemotherapy. Moreover, low
false-negative rates are attainable in this setting. Induction
chemotherapy should not relegate clinically N0 patients
after NACT to the morbidity of ALND.
Encouraged by these results, we have abandoned
‘‘automatic’’ complete (levels I and II) ALND in patients
who are receiving induction chemotherapy whose axillae
are considered clinically negative after their chemotherapy, irrespective of their lymph node status before
embarking on NACT. We perform SLNB on each of
these patients after NACT, using the results from the biopsy to influence our decision for completion dissection.
With a median follow-up of slightly more than 5 years, we
have not encountered an axillary recurrence, although we
recognize the relatively short-term period of follow-up observation. However, we believe that this observation (ie,
the absence of axillary recurrence) is a reasonable surrogate
for a ‘‘truly negative’’ SLNB, notwithstanding the
unavoidable irradiation to the low axilla as part of the
radiation fields when the whole breast is radiated, which
can affect residual lymph node tissue at level I and often at
level II as well.

Original Article

In summary, we have demonstrated not only that
the SLNB after neoadjuvant chemotherapy is not only a
reasonable treatment option with a high likelihood of success but also that the accuracy of this procedure is likewise
high enough to make SLNB after NACT the appropriate
choice when the axilla has been downstaged to N0 status.
In our experience, this is valid regardless of the findings at
initial presentation.
