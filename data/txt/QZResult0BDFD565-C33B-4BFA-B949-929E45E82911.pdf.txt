Abstract

Author Manuscript

Mdm2 is the major negative regulator of p53 tumor suppressor activity. This oncoprotein is
overexpressed in many human tumors that retain the wild type p53 allele. As such, targeted
inhibition of Mdm2 is being considered as a therapeutic anticancer strategy. The N-terminal
hydrophobic pocket of Mdm2 binds to p53 and thereby inhibits the transcription of p53 target
genes. Additionally, the C-terminus of Mdm2 contains a RING domain with intrinsic ubiquitin E3
ligase activity. By recruiting E2 ubiquitin conjugating enzyme(s), Mdm2 acts as a molecular
scaffold to facilitate p53 ubiquitination and proteasome-dependent degradation. Mdmx (Mdm4),
an Mdm2 homolog, also has a RING domain and hetero-oligomerizes with Mdm2 to stimulate its
E3 ligase activity. Recent studies have shown that C-terminal residues adjacent to the RING
domain of both Mdm2 and Mdmx contribute to Mdm2 E3 ligase activity. However, the molecular
mechanisms mediating this process remain unclear, and the biological consequences of inhibiting
Mdm2/Mdmx co-operation or blocking Mdm2 ligase function are relatively unexplored. This
study presents biochemical and cell biological data that further elucidate the mechanisms by which
Mdm2 and Mdmx co-operate to regulate p53 level and activity. We use chemical and genetic
approaches to demonstrate that functional inhibition of Mdm2 ubiquitin ligase activity is
insufficient for p53 activation. This unexpected result suggests that concomitant treatment with
Mdm2/Mdmx antagonists may be needed to achieve therapeutic benefit.

Introduction
The p53 protein is most often considered a stress-activated tumor suppressor but its
functions likely evolved for other purposes (1). Recent studies indicate that p53 preserves
genome integrity in the male germline, limits teratogen-induced developmental
abnormalities, contributes to implantation and modulates metabolism (2). Its tumor
suppressive role emerges when it is activated by genotoxic conditions or expression of
oncogenes, whereupon it eliminates potentially tumorigenic cells via induction of cell cycle
arrest, apoptosis, senescence or autophagy. Given the importance of p53 function in normal
growth processes, as well as in response to tumor-initiating conditions, sophisticated
mechanisms have evolved to limit p53 activity until it is absolutely required, and to then
titrate its output in a stress and cell-appropriate fashion.

Author Manuscript

P53 activity is controlled by two broad mechanisms. First is a complex array of posttranslational modifications that affect its ability to engage with relevant co-activators or
negative regulators. This in turn determines p53 stability and abundance, and its ability to
productively engage chromatin to regulate downstream target genes and micro-RNAs (3, 4).
Second are mechanisms that control the stability and/or activity of its negative regulators,
most significant of which are the related RING domain proteins, Mdm2 and Mdmx (also
known as Mdm4) (5). Embryonic deletion of either protein engenders early lethality that is
completely p53-dependent, underscoring their critical role during development. Conditional
deletion of either Mdm2 or Mdmx indicates that while both restrict p53 activation in almost
all tissues tested, Mdm2 loss often has a more profound effect (6). These data suggest a
modulatory, role for Mdmx in many somatic tissues, with possibly more important roles in
actively dividing tissues (7, 8).

Both Mdm2 and Mdmx contain a RING domain, variants of which are found in several
hundred human proteins. In the case of Mdm2, the RING domain possesses E3 ubiquitin
ligase activity: it recruits one or more E2 ubiquitin conjugating enzymes (hereafter E2, (9))
and facilitates transfer of ubiquitin from E2 to p53 and other substrates (10), leading to their
proteasome-dependent degradation (11). As p53 is a transcription factor, Mdm2-dependent
degradation is therefore an effective mechanism to modulate activation of p53 target genes.
The binding of both Mdm2 and Mdmx to p53 also directly inhibits p53 transactivation
function by preventing recruitment of transcriptional co-activators (8). Although Mdmx also
has a RING domain, it does not possess intrinsic ubiquitin ligase activity (12). RINGmediated oligomerization is a conserved function of this domain, and Mdm2 is able to
homo-oligomerize, as well as hetero-oligomerize with Mdmx. By analogy with other RING/
RING heterodimeric complexes (such as Brca1/Bard1, where only Brca1 has ligase activity
(13)), a model in which Mdmx enhances Mdm2-dependent p53 ubiquitylation has been
proposed (12). However, the precise molecular mechanism(s) by which Mdmx modulates
Mdm2 function remain to be defined.
Although Mdmx co-operates with Mdm2 to inhibit p53 function, Mdmx can also be targeted
for Mdm2-dependent degradation (14). Following genotoxic stress, Mdmx downregulation
contributes to p53 activation. Indeed, attenuating damage-induced Mdmx degradation in
vivo reduces both basal and stress-induced p53 activities. This engenders both remarkable

radioresistance, and dramatically increases sensitivity to Myc-induced lymphomagenesis
(15). In addition to the Mdm2 and Mdmx RING domains, residues at the extreme C
terminus of each protein are also important for regulation of Mdm2 ubiquitin ligase function
(16, 17). Structural and functional analyses predict that C-terminal aromatic residues in both
Mdm2 and Mdmx play a critical role in the context of Mdm2/Mdmx hetero-oligomers
(16-19). Mdm2 point mutants in this region prevent p53 degradation, yet allow Mdmx
degradation. Furthermore, Mdmx can restore Mdm2-directed ligase activity to these
mutants, seemingly by providing the C-terminal residues in trans. These data suggest that
the extreme C-terminus provides subtle structural elements that are critical for controlling
p53 ubiquitylation; however, the mechanistic basis for these effects remains to be
determined.

Author Manuscript

As both Mdm2 and Mdmx are potential therapeutic targets for cancer treatment (5), insight
into their molecular interplay may inform new drug discovery and development strategies.
Here, we investigate the effects of Mdm2 ligase inhibition on the control of p53 stability and
activity. We show that the Mdmx extreme C-terminus comprises a key regulatory element
affecting the degradation of endogenous p53 and Mdm2; it is also required for degradation
of Mdmx in response to DNA damage. Using a genetic approach, we show that the
inhibition of Mdm2 ligase function leads to stabilization of transcriptionally inactive p53.
Furthermore, the stabilized p53 can be reactivated by attenuation of the interaction of p53
with either Mdm2 or Mdmx. These findings indicate that drugs designed to selectively
inhibit Mdm2 ligase activity may, if used alone, not activate p53 sufficiently to elicit
adequate anti-tumor effects. Rather, as they do engender significant increases in p53
abundance, they may achieve therapeutic benefits if used in combination with Mdm2 and/or
Mdmx antagonists.

Results
Functional inhibition of Mdm2 stabilizes endogenous p53

Author Manuscript

By analogy with other heterodimeric E3 ligases, residues in the Mdm2 and Mdmx Cterminal tails may contribute to the correct structure for recruitment or processivity of the E2
conjugating enzyme(s) required for p53 degradation. While a previous study found that
Mdm2 and Mdmx C-terminal point mutants (Mdm2Y489A and MdmxF488A, respectively)
prevented Mdm2-dependent degradation of p53, the consequences for p53 activation were
not explored (17). We therefore initiated a genetic approach to evaluate the functional
consequences of Mdm2 ligase inhibition by generating U2OS cell lines expressing
doxycycline (Dox)-inducible wild type (WT) and Mdm2Y489A and MdmxF488A. U2OS was
chosen as the host cell since it retains a wild type p53 allele, and expresses a molecular
excess of Mdm2 over Mdmx (20). This provides a situation in which the excess Mdm2 is a
relevant physiological target for evaluating the effects of exogenously expressed Mdm2 or
Mdmx mutants. A relatively high dose (100ng/ml) of doxycycline was used for comparisons
between Mdm2 and Mdmx, since at lower doses we either failed to see robust increases in
the levels of Dox-inducible Mdm2 or observed cell-to-cell heterogeneity in Mdm2 levels
(data not shown). This is consistent with previous reports of differential expression of
Mdm2 and Mdmx from the same promoter (21). Importantly, MdmxWT was downregulated

by DNA damage at both low and high dose doxycycline (see Supplementary Figure 1C and
D), indicating that the levels of induction achieved at the maximum Dox dose used for these
studies is not saturating the capacity of the damage response system to induce Mdmx
degradation.

Author Manuscript

Figure 1 shows the effects of Mdm2Y489A and MdmxF488A overexpression on levels of p53
and its downstream target, p21. As expected, induction of Mdm2WT led to a decrease in p53,
and corresponding decrease in p21. In contrast, Mdm2Y489A expression led to an increase in
p53, likely due to inhibition of endogenous Mdm2 E3 ligase activity (17). Note that despite
the increase in p53 abundance, the levels of p21 were reduced by Mdm2Y489A expression
(Figure 1 and Supplementary Figures 1E and F). Similarly, overexpression of MdmxF488A
increased p53 steady state levels, yet p21 did not increase. The ability of MdmxF488A to
stabilize p53, yet suppress p53-dependent transactivation was also observed at low dose
(15ng/ml) doxycycline (Supplementary Figure 1A, B, E, F). At this dose of doxycycline,
exogenous Mdmx levels were approximately four-fold those observed in MCF7 cells, a
breast cancer cell line with Mdmx gene amplification (Danovi et al 2004). Together, these
data suggest that while the extreme C-terminal aromatic residues of Mdm2 and Mdmx are
required for p53 degradation, they are dispensable for suppression of p53 transcriptional
activity (see below).

Author Manuscript

We next investigated the mechanism by which MdmxF488A causes stabilization of p53.
Figure 2 shows that MdmxF488A expression increased the half-life of both endogenous
Mdm2 and p53, and this was not accompanied by a change in Mdm2 mRNA levels (Figure
2A and 2B). This suggests that MdmxF488A causes post-transcriptional stabilization of
Mdm2 by inhibiting Mdm2 ubiquitin ligase activity, and this leads to concomitant p53
stabilization. We tested the hypothesis that MdmxF488A inhibits ubiquitin ligase activity by
determining the extent of p53 ubiquitylation in cell lines expressing equivalent levels of
MdmxWT or MdmxF488A. Consistent with this proposal, the total levels of p53 are higher in
cells expressing MdmxF488A compared to MdmxWT, and the amount of ubiquitylated p53 is
significantly lower in cells expressing this mutant (Figure 2C). These data are consistent
with a previous study in which p53 ubiquitylation was reduced by Mdm2Y489A (17).
MdmxF488A binds Mdm2 and p53, but reduces p53 ubiquitylation

Author Manuscript

Like some other RING E3 ubiquitin ligase complexes, such as Brca1/Bard1, Mdm2 and
Mdmx can hetero-oligomerize. As only Mdm2 possesses E3 ubiquitin ligase activity, a
reasonable explanation for the above results is that MdmxF488A hetero-oligomerizes with
Mdm2 and reduces its ability to degrade p53. However, MdmxF488A could also stabilize p53
by more indirect mechanisms. For example, MdmxF488A might antagonize p53-dependent
transactivation of Mdm2, leading to a reduction in Mdm2 levels. This is unlikely, since
Mdm2 mRNA levels are similar in the presence and absence of MdmxF488A (Figure 2B).
The inability of MdmxF488A to activate p53 while increasing p53 levels was surprising, and
could be explained by its ability to suppress p53-dependent transactivation concomitant with
binding to, and inactivation of, Mdm2 ligase function. To begin to explore this possibility,
we first determined whether MdmxF488A could bind both Mdm2 and p53 using the

proximity ligation in situ assay (PLISA, see Supplementary Figure 2 for a description of the
method, and (22)).

Author Manuscript

PLISA confirmed that MdmxF488A binds endogenous Mdm2 and p53 in intact cells (Figures
3A and B). Induction of MdmxWT led to a small but detectable increase in the interaction
between Mdmx and Mdm2, as shown by an increase in the number of PLISA foci (Figure
3A, panel ii). The PLISA signal for Mdmx/Mdm2 interaction was much more robust after
MdmxF488A induction (Figure 3A, panel vi). This is in part due to the elevated Mdm2 levels
in MdmxF488A expressing cells (see Supplementary Figure 3A and western blots in Figures
4 and 6). Interaction of Mdm2 with MdmxWT was detected in the nucleus, but appeared
slightly enriched in the cytoplasm (Figure 3A, panel ii). This did not appear to be due to a
preferential enrichment of either protein in the cytoplasm (Supplementary Figure 3C). In the
case of MdmxF488A, the intensity of PLISA foci was greatest in the nuclei, although the
Mdm2/Mdmx interaction was also detected in the cytoplasm (data not shown). These data
confirm that the MdmxF488A mutation does not significantly interfere with Mdm2 binding,
and that Mdm2 and MdmxF488A interact in both nuclear and cytoplasmic compartments in
situ.

Author Manuscript

PLISA analyses revealed that MdmxWT and MdmxF488A also interact with p53 (Figure 3B).
Again, the signal in the cells expressing MdmxF488A cell line was higher than in those
expressing MdmxWT, in part because induction of the F488A mutant leads to increased p53
levels. Standard immunofluorescence showed that both MdmxWT and MdmxF488A were
distributed throughout the nucleus and cytoplasm, but p53 was predominantly nuclear
following induction of MdmxF488A (Supplementary Figures 3B and C). This likely
contributes to the preferential localization of p53/Mdmx PLISA signal in the nucleus.
Cytoplasmic PLISA signals were also observed at a higher intensity in MdmxF488A cells
compared to MdmxWT, presumably due to the increased total p53 levels (data not shown).
The PLISA signal faithfully reflects p53-Mdmx interaction since many fewer PLISA signals
were observed in Dox-inducible cells expressing equivalent levels of the p53 bindingdeficient Mdmx mutant, G57A (Supplementary Figure 3D). Conventional
immunoprecipitation also confirmed that MdmxF488A is found in complex with Mdm2 and
with p53 (Supplementary Figures 4A and B). Finally, we found that mutation of the Mdmx
p53 binding site does not affect the ability of MdmxF488A to stabilize p53 (Supplementary
Figure 4C and Figure 5C). Together, these data show that MdmxF488A binds both p53 and
Mdm2, and suggest that the dominant negative effect of MdmxF488A is due to direct
perturbation of Mdm2 ligase function, rather than sequestration of p53.
Both Mdm2Y489A and MdmxF488A suppresses p53 transactivation function

Author Manuscript

Since an increase in p53 level is often associated with increased p53 activity, we next
determined whether the p53 stabilized in cells expressing Mdm2Y489A or MdmxF488A was
transcriptionally active. As expected, induction of Mdm2WT reduced p53 level and
transcriptional activity (Figure 4A, lane 2 and Figure 4C). By contrast, induction of
Mdm2Y489A stabilized p53, yet was still able to suppress p53 activity (Figure 4A, lane 6 and
Figure 4C). In fact, although Mdm2Y489A expression and treatment with the DNA damaging
agent neocarzinostatin (NCS) led to similar increases in p53 level, p53 transcriptional

activity was only increased by damage (compare lanes 6 and 7). These data demonstrate that
ligase-deficient Mdm2 retains the capacity to suppress p53-dependent transactivation,
presumably by binding to and occluding the p53 transactivation domain. Similar results
were obtained by comparing the effects of MdmxWT and MdmxF488A (Figure 4B).
Specifically, while MdmxF488A expression led to an increase in p53 level, there was no
corresponding increase in p53 transcriptional activity (Figure 4B, compare lanes 5 and 6 and
Figure 4D). Again, although p53 levels following MdmxF488A expression or DNA damage
were similar, p53 was only active in the latter case (Figure 4B, compare lanes 6 and 7 and
Figure 4D). By normalizing the amount of p21 mRNA to p53 protein, we found that both
Mdm2Y489A and MdmxF488A reduce p53 specific activity (Supplementary Figure 5A and
B).

Author Manuscript

Following DNA damage, we observed that MdmxWT but not MdmxF488A was
downregulated (Figure 4B, compare lanes 6 and 8). This is consistent with a dominant
negative function of MdmxF488A, since downregulation of Mdmx after DNA damage is an
Mdm2-dependent process (14, 23). Similarly, Mdm2Y489A appeared significantly more
stable than Mdm2WT following NCS treatment (Figure 4A, compare lanes 2 and 4, 6 and 8).
Intriguingly, neither Mdm2Y489A nor MdmxF488A expression was sufficient to block
damage-induced p53 activation (compare lanes 3 and 4, 7 and 8 in Figures 4C and D).
Taken together, these data suggest that DNA damage signaling can counteract the
suppressive effects of Mdm2 ligase inhibition on p53 activation. Additionally, the finding
that DNA damage leads to downregulation of MdmxWT (Figure 4B) and destabilization of
Mdm2WT (Figure 4A and Supplementary Figure 6) indicates that, although these proteins
are overexpressed, they are still subject to regulation by endogenous damage signaling
pathways.

Antagonizing the interaction between p53 and Mdm2Y489A or MdmxF488A derepresses p53
activity and elicits a cytotoxic response
Inhibition of Mdm2 ligase activity is suggested as a potential anticancer strategy in tumors
with wild type p53 (24, 25). However, whether the ensuing p53 stabilization would be
sufficient to elicit a cytotoxic response remains unclear. This is since inhibition of Mdm2
ligase activity would also stabilize Mdm2 itself, which could then interact with and
antagonize p53. In this case, combinations of Mdm2 ligase inhibitors and Mdm2
antagonists, such as Nutlin-3a (hereafter Nutlin) may be required. We utilized the
Mdm2Y489A and MdmxF488A inducible cell lines to investigate the potential for such an
approach.

Author Manuscript

Although Mdm2Y489A stabilizes p53, expression of the protein did not affect the growth of
U2OS cells with wild type p53 (Figure 5A and B). This is consistent with the ability of
Mdm2Y489A to block p53-dependent transactivation. By contrast, Nutlin suppressed colony
outgrowth in the presence of both Mdm2WT and Mdm2Y489A, even though the increase in
p53 abundance was similar (data not shown). Thus, while inhibition of Mdm2 ligase activity
stabilizes p53, concurrent treatment with an Mdm2 antagonist is required for a maximal
cytotoxic response.

A prediction from these results is that cells in which Mdm2 ligase activity is blocked by the
MdmxF488A mutant would not be sensitive to Nutlin, as numerous reports show that this
drug interacts poorly with the Mdmx hydrophobic p53 binding pocket (26, 27). To address
this, we repeated the colony outgrowth experiments with MdmxWT and MdmxF488A.
Consistent with previous studies, induction of MdmxWT reduced basal levels of Mdm2
protein and mRNA by 50% (Figure 6A and B), whereas treatment with Nutlin alone lead to
the expected increase in Mdm2 mRNA and protein (Figure 6A, lane 3). Induction of
MdmxF488A or treatment with Nutlin both lead to similar increases in p53 and Mdm2
protein levels (Figure 6A, lanes 6 and 7), yet p53-dependent transactivation increased only
with the Mdm2 antagonist (Figure 6B, bars 6 and 7 and Supplementary Figure 5D). This
underscores the notion that MdmxF488A retains the ability to antagonize p53-dependent
transcription while concomitantly stabilizing both Mdm2 and p53 proteins.

Author Manuscript

Since Nutlin is a less potent antagonist of Mdmx, Mdmx overexpression should attenuate
Nutlin-induced p53 activation. Following Nutlin treatment, MdmxWT marginally inhibited
p53 activation, while MdmxF488A expression had a more robust effect (compare Figure 6B
lanes 3 and 4, and lanes 7 and 8). Consistent with this observation, only MdmxF488A
appeared to attenuate Nutlin-induced p53 specific activity (Supplementary Figure 5C).

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

The above results show that while MdmxF488A blocks Mdm2 E3 ligase activity and
stabilizes p53, its ability to inhibit p53-dependent transactivation remains intact. A
prediction from the preceding results is that while p53 levels are elevated, cells expressing
MdmxF488A should continue to proliferate due to inhibition of p53 transactivation.
Consistent with this, expression of MdmxF488A alone did not inhibit growth, despite the high
level of p53 under these conditions (Figure 6C). These findings suggest that inhibiting p53
degradation can be tolerated, providing the Mdmx/p53 interaction is preserved. Conversely,
disrupting Mdmx/p53 binding under these conditions should lead to increased p53dependent toxicity. In order to test this, we introduced a second mutation into MdmxF488A.
This mutation (G57A) reduces the interaction of Mdmx with p53 ((28) and Supplementary
Figures 3 and 7). Figure 6D shows that although MdmxF488A and MdmxG57A/F488A each
lead to p53 accumulation, only MdmxG57A/F488A causes an increase in p53 activity
(measured as an increase in the level of p21 protein). Importantly, the elevated p53 activity
in MdmxG57A/F488A was not due to higher total p53 levels, or a low Mdmx:p53 ratio
(Supplementary Figure 7). Interestingly, although MdmxG57A/F488A and Nutlin stabilized
p53 to similar levels, induction of p21 was much higher after Nutlin treatment. Additionally,
although prolonged expression of MdmxG57A/F488A Mdmx was associated with a marked
decrease in cell viability compared with MdmxF488A, cell survival was significantly higher
than following Nutlin treatment (Figure 6E, compare lanes 2 and 6). In theory, this could be
due either to the increased Mdm2 levels resulting from MdmxG57A/F488A, inhibition of
Mdm2 E3 ligase activity, or because MdmxG57A/F488A has some residual binding to p53
(Supplementary Figure 7). We used Nutlin, an Mdm2-selective antagonist (27), as a
chemical probe to ascertain whether a putative Mdm2/MdmxG57A/F488A heterodimer might
bind to and inhibit p53 function. Indeed, we found that the viability of cells expressing
MdmxG57A/F488A was further decreased by Nutlin treatment (Figure 6E, compare lanes 6
and 8), indicating that the elevated level of stabilized Mdm2 is a significant determinant of

p53 activity following induction of MdmxG57A/F488A. Together, these data suggest
inhibition of Mdm2 ligase activity may be most effective when combined with either Mdm2
or Mdmx antagonists.

Discussion

Author Manuscript

The functional co-operation between Mdm2 and Mdmx may be a critical component for
regulating p53 levels in normal cells. Therefore, understanding the mechanistic basis for this
may aid rational design of Mdm2/Mdmx targeted therapeutics. Mdm2/Mdmx binding
proceeds via RING/RING domain interaction, which is utilized by a large number of other
RING domain-containing human proteins. Thus, findings from studies of Mdm2 and Mdmx
may provide greater insight into molecular mechanisms in other RING E3 ligase-associated
pathways. In this manuscript, we provide further insight into the regulation of p53 by Mdm2
and Mdmx, and show that the co-operation between the two proteins is critical for p53
abundance control. Additionally, our data suggest that correct Mdm2/Mdmx heterooligomerization is critical for degradation of Mdmx following DNA damage. These findings
indicate that regulating Mdm2/Mdmx hetero-oligomerization is likely to be a key
determinant of p53-dependent responses to genotoxic stress.

Previous studies indicated that MdmxF488A inhibits Mdm2-dependent degradation of p53
(17). We confirmed and extended these observations by showing that expression of
MdmxF488A leads to stabilization of non-ubiquitylated, endogenous p53. RING E3 ubiquitin
ligases (including Mdm2) bind to E2s, and facilitate the transfer of ubiquitin to their target
substrates (in this case, p53). Since we show the interaction between Mdm2 and p53 is not
perturbed in the presence of MdmxF488A, the most likely explanation is that transfer of
ubiquitin to p53 is being inhibited. As structural studies suggest the MdmxF488A mutation
perturbs the function of the Mdm2/Mdmx heterodimer (19), we infer this mutation may
prevent the recruitment of E2 to the complex. Alternatively, E2 may be recruited, but unable
to transfer its ubiquitin cargo to p53. This would be consistent with proposals that RING E3
ligases can allosterically activate E2 to facilitate ubiquitin transfer (29, 30). Since
MdmxF488A can be detected in complexes containing both p53 and Mdm2, we suggest that
MdmxF488A induction is effectively a “substrate trap”, and may facilitate detection of
intermediates in the degradation of p53. We also show that optimal Mdmx degradation after
DNA damage requires an intact Mdmx extreme C-terminus. As damage-induced
phosphorylation of MdmxF488A and its binding to Mdm2 are unperturbed, the failure to
degrade Mdmx is likely due to defects in Mdm2-dependent ubiquitylation. Recent studies
have shown that following DNA damage, degradation of Mdmx is associated with an
increase in p53 transactivation function (15, 31). In the present study, p53 activation was
equivalent in cells expressing both MdmxWT and MdmxF488A, even though the latter protein
was not degraded after damage. It is likely that additional damage-induced modifications to
p53 itself, and possibly to the RING domains of both Mdm2 and Mdmx are responsible for
this effect (32, 33). Together with the finding that phosphorylation of the Mdm2 and Mdmx
N-termini also contribute to p53 activation (34, 35), these data highlight the redundancy
built into damage signaling pathways to ensure a ‘failsafe’ p53 response to genotoxic stress.

Earlier studies provided compelling evidence for the functional co-operation between Mdm2
and Mdmx (16-19, 36, 37). Modeling this molecular interaction in vivo is beginning to
provide further insight into its biological importance. For example, a point mutation of the
Mdm2 RING domain that destroys RING structure (C462A) and blocks Mdm2 ligase
activity triggers p53 stabilization and leads to p53-dependent embryonic lethality (38).
Additionally, mutation or deletion of the Mdmx RING also prevents Mdm2/Mdmx
interaction and triggers p53-dependent lethality in vivo (39, 40). In these systems, Mdm2
remains unstable, likely explaining the inability to control p53 activity under these
conditions. Therefore, it is still unclear whether complete inhibition of Mdm2 ligase activity,
in the context of structurally intact Mdm2/Mdmx RING domains, would be sufficient to
activate p53. Our in vitro data suggest that a high level of structurally intact but ligasedeficient Mdm2 can still block p53 activity. Whether this is recapitulated at physiological
levels in vivo remains an open question. An in vivo study of MdmxF488A and Mdm2Y489A
(17) would also provides a direct test of whether ligase-independent RING domain activities
of Mdm2 contribute to its biological function.

Our results also have implications for the design of drugs that block Mdm2 ligase activity by
inhibiting the function of the Mdm2/Mdmx hetero-oligomer. We show here that perturbing
the function of the hetero-oligomer increases p53 levels, suggesting ligase inhibition would
be a viable anticancer strategy. However, in our system, p53 stabilization was not sufficient
to trigger its activation, since it was antagonized by stabilized Mdm2 or high levels of
exogenous Mdmx. Thus, we infer that increasing p53 level by blocking Mdm2 ligase
activity may not be sufficient to trigger a robust p53 response. Previous studies lead to the
discovery of the HLI series of compounds, which block Mdm2 ligase activity and lead to
p53 stabilization (24, 41). In contrast to our results, treatment with HLI compounds also
activated p53-dependent transcription. One explanation for this discrepancy is that the levels
of exogenous Mdm2 or Mdmx used in our system exceed those present following treatment
of tumor cells with HLI compounds. However, our results with MdmxG57A/F488A show the
increase of endogenous Mdm2 following Mdm2 ligase inhibition can also block p53dependent transactivation. We suggest, therefore that there are cases in which Mdm2 ligase
inhibition alone may not be sufficient to trigger p53 activation. In such instances, either
treatment with antagonists such as Nutlin as single agents, or in combination with ligase
inhibitors may be more effective.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture and drug treatments

Author Manuscript

MCF7 cells were cultured in DMEM/10% FBS with Ciprofloxacin (CIP, 10 μg/ml). U2OS
cells with doxycycline-inducible human Mdmx expression cassettes were generated as
previously described (42) and cultured in DMEM/10% FBS/CIP/G418 (400 μg/ml).
Doxycycline (SIGMA, St Louis, MO) was dissolved in water as stocks of 500 μg/ml and
frozen at −20°C. Neocarzinostatin (stock 1 mg/ml in sodium acetate) was obtained from
Robert Schultz at NCI, the proteasome inhibitor MG132 was from Calbiochem and
Nutlin-3a was a kind gift of Lyubomir Vassilev (Hoffman-La Roche, Nutley, NJ). Unless

otherwise stated, Nutlin-3a was used at a final concentration of 10 μM. Cycloheximide (US
Biologicals) was dissolved in 0.1% ethanol and used at a final concentration of 100 μg/ml.
Western blotting, immunoprecipitation and antibodies

Author Manuscript

Cells were lyzed in Oren Buffer (50 mM Tris, pH 8.0, 5 mM EDTA, 150 mM NaCl, 0.5%
NP-40, 1 mM PMSF, 1 mM sodium vanadate, 10 mM NaF, and Complete Mini Protease
Inhibitors (Roche)), at 4°C for 30 min. Following SDS-PAGE, proteins were transferred to
PVDF membrane (Millipore, MA). The following antibodies were used for western blotting:
p53, DO1 (Calbiochem, mouse, 1:1000) or FL-393 (Santa Cruz, rabbit, 1: 1500); Mdmx,
BL1258 (Bethyl Laboratories, 1:10000, overnight); Mdm2, triple mouse monoclonal
cocktail of IF-2 (Calbiochem), SMP-14 (Santa Cruz) and 4B2 (Calbiochem) (1:500 each,
overnight); p21, C-19 (Santa Cruz, rabbit 1:1500 or Cip/Waf1 (Transduction Labs, mouse
IgG2a, 1:500); actin, (rabbit, 1:20000, SIGMA, MO). Peroxidase-conjugated secondary
antibody was used at 1:10000 (Jackson Immunochemicals). For LiCor far-red western
analysis, lysis was as above, but protein was transferred to Immobilon-Fluor (Millipore,
MA) prior to blocking with BioRad PBS/Casein Blocker per the manufacturer’s instructions.
Species-specific secondary antibodies for LiCor analysis were conjugate to Alexa Fluor 680
(Molecular Probes) or IRD-800 (Rockland, PA). Analysis was performed using Odyssey
v3.0 software. For immunoprecipitation analyses, cells were harvested on the plate in Oren
Buffer. Typically, 500μg-1mg of protein was used for immunoprecipitation. The antibodies
used were: DO1 or agarose bead-conjugated FL393 (p53), anti-HA (HA.11, Covance),
BL-1258 (Human Mdmx, Bethyl Labs). 2μg of each antibody per milligram of protein was
used. Immobilized recombinant protein A was used for antibody pulldown, and
immunoprecipitates were washed and eluted as described (43).

Proximity ligation in situ assay

Author Manuscript

U2OS cells expressing a doxycycline-inducible HA-HDMX construct (20) were seeded onto
coverslips and treated with doxycyline for 24 h. Cells were fixed in 3.7% paraformaldehyde, washed in PBS, and permeabilized in 0.2% Triton X-100 for 5 min.
Coverslips were then blocked in 10% normal goat serum in PBS (NGS) for 2 h. For
Mdmx/p53 PLISA, primary antibodies HA.11 (Covance, 1:500) and FL-393 (Santa Cruz,
1:1000) were diluted in PBS/EDTA/0.2% Triton X-100/2% NGS and incubated at 4°C
overnight. For Mdmx/Mdm2 PLISA, primary antibodies BL-1258 (1:1000) and 5B10
(1:500) were used. Note that some background staining in the absence of doxycycline is
observed using BL-1258, but the inducible nature of the system permitted clear distinction
of Mdmx/Mdm2 complex formation. Following washes with TBS/0.05% Tween-20, a
proximity ligation in situ assay (PLISA) was performed according to the manufacturer’s
protocol (Detection Kit 613, OLink Bioscience, Sweden) with the following exception: goat
anti-rabbit (minus) and anti-mouse (plus) PLISA probes were diluted in NGS at 1:10 instead
of 1:5. Coverslips were mounted on microscope slides and images acquired using OpenLab
software (Perkin-Elmer/Improvision, UK) and a Zeiss Axioplan 2 microscope with 63x
magnification. Post-image capture, nuclear (Hoechst) images were contrast-enhanced and all
PLISA images (red foci) from untreated and Dox-treated cells were contrast-enhanced
simultaneously to reduce background (non-focal) signals. RGB planes of nuclei and PLISA
foci were then overlaid.

Ubiquitylation assay

Author Manuscript

U2OS were transfected with His-tagged ubiquitin using FuGene HD (Roche) at a 2:5 ratio
(DNA to FuGeneHD). After 6h, transfection reagent was replaced with regular medium in
the presence or absence of doxycycline to induce MdmxWT or MdmxF488A. 24h later, cells
were lysed, and pulldown of ubiquitylated proteins was performed using agarose-conjugated
Ni2+ beads (Invitrogen, licensed from Qiagen). Lysis and wash conditions were as
previously described (44, 45). Following SDS-PAGE and transfer to PVDF membrane,
ubiquitylated p53 was visualized using DO-1 antibody.
Quantitative PCR

Author Manuscript

Total RNA was prepared using QiaShredder and RNeasy RNA isolation kits per the
manufacturer’s instructions (Qiagen, CA). 2μg of total RNA per sample was used for cDNA
synthesis with random hexamer primers, using SuperScriptIII Reverse Transcriptase system
(Invitrogen, CA). Real time quantitative PCR was performed using an ABI PRISM 7700
Sequence Detection System, using Platinum SYBR SuperMix (Invitrogen) with ROX as an
internal standard. Changes in gene expression were normalized to 18S mRNA. Primer
sequences supplied on request.
Colony outgrowth

Author Manuscript

For colony formation assays, cells were plated at 3000/6cm plate and colonies were allowed
to form (~2 days) before addition of Doxycycline for 24h prior to treatment with 10μM
Nutlin (for 2 days). After a further 5-6 days, cells were fixed in 3.7% para-formaldehyde and
stained with crystal violet. Images of colonies were taken on the plate, and then dye was
extracted in Sorenson’s buffer (50mM sodium citrate, 50mM citric acid in 50% (v/v) ethanol
solution) and quantified by absorbance at 590nm.
