Abstract
Normal progression through the cell cycle requires the
sequential action of cyclin-dependent kinases CDK1, CDK2,
CDK4, and CDK6. Direct or indirect deregulation of CDK
activity is a feature of almost all cancers and has led to the
development of CDK inhibitors as anticancer agents. The CDKactivating kinase (CAK) plays a critical role in regulating cell
cycle by mediating the activating phosphorylation of CDK1,
CDK2, CDK4, and CDK6. As such, CDK7, which also regulates
transcription as part of the TFIIH basal transcription factor, is
an attractive target for the development of anticancer drugs.
Computer modeling of the CDK7 structure was used to design
potential potent CDK7 inhibitors. Here, we show that a
pyrazolo[1,5-a ]pyrimidine–derived compound, BS-181,
inhibited CAK activity with an IC50 of 21 nmol/L. Testing of
other CDKs as well as another 69 kinases showed that BS-181
only inhibited CDK2 at concentrations lower than 1 Mmol/L,
with CDK2 being inhibited 35-fold less potently (IC50
880 nmol/L) than CDK7. In MCF-7 cells, BS-181 inhibited the
phosphorylation of CDK7 substrates, promoted cell cycle
arrest and apoptosis to inhibit the growth of cancer cell lines,
and showed antitumor effects in vivo. The drug was stable
in vivo with a plasma elimination half-life in mice of 405
minutes after i.p. administration of 10 mg/kg. The same dose
of drug inhibited the growth of MCF-7 human xenografts in
nude mice. BS-181 therefore provides the first example of a
potent and selective CDK7 inhibitor with potential as an
anticancer agent. [Cancer Res 2009;69(15):6208–15]

Introduction
Cyclin-dependent kinases (CDK) control cell proliferation by
regulating entry into and passage through the cell cycle, initiation
of DNA synthesis (S phase), and mitosis (M phase; ref. 1). CDKs are
the catalytic subunits of a large family of serine/threonine protein
kinases. Activation of specific CDKs is required for the appropriate
progression through the cell cycle and into the next stage in the cell
cycle. Hence, regulation of CDK activity is pivotal for the correct
timing of cell cycle progression and CDK activity is tightly
regulated at many levels, including complex formation with cyclins

and CDK inhibitors (CDKI) and by phosphorylation and dephosphorylation. Central to the activation of a given CDK is the
requirement for association with specific cyclins and phosphorylation at a threonine residue in the activation loop (T-loop; ref. 2).
In metazoans, phosphorylation of the CDKs that are required for
cell cycle progression (CDK1, CDK2, CDK4, CDK6) is mediated by
the CDK-activating kinase (CAK) having three subunits, CDK7,
cyclin H (CycH), and MAT1 (3–5).
Deregulation of CDK activity forms an important part of many
cancers, as well as other disease states, generally through elevated
and/or inappropriate activation, as CDKs are infrequently mutated.
Important mechanisms of CDK deregulation include cyclin overexpression, e.g., cyclin D1 (6), and loss of CDKI expression through
mutational or epigenetic alterations ( for review, see ref. 7). As such,
CDKs are important targets for the design of anticancer drugs.
Inhibitors of some CDKs, particular emphasis being placed on
inhibitors of CDK2 as it controls S-phase entry, have been
developed and a few have been tested in the clinical setting as
anticancer agents (8–10). One of these is flavopiridol, which has
modest selectivity for CDKs over other kinases and inhibits many
members of the CDK family (11). The compound class that has
yielded many CDK-selective ATP antagonists is 2,6,9-trisubstituted
purines, exemplified by roscovitine, which shows good biological
and pharmacologic properties (12, 13). CDK7 is an attractive target
for drug development due to its critical role in the activation of the
CDKs required for cell cycle progression (3, 5). This is especially
significant as there is evidence that inhibition of some cell cycle
CDKs may be compensated for by other CDKs. Hence, cells from
mice that have been ablated for CDK2 are able to cycle, and
CDK2 / mice are viable (14, 15). Similarly, CDK4 / and CDK6 /
mice are viable, although the double-null mice show late
embryonic lethality. However, mice lacking MAT1 die early in
embryogenesis (16), indicative of a cellular requirement for CAK.
Most described CDK inhibitors that potently inhibit CDK2 also
inhibit CDK7, albeit at considerably higher concentrations than
the concentrations required for CDK2 inhibition (13, 17). These
compounds generally also inhibit other CDKs such as CDK5 and
CDK9, which play important roles in neuronal development and
transcription (15, 17–19). In addition to its role in cell cycle
regulation, CDK7/CycH/MAT1 are components of the general
transcription factor TFIIH (20, 21), required for initiation of
transcription of RNA polymerase II (PolII)–directed genes. As part
of the TFIIH complex, CDK7 phosphorylates the COOH-terminal
domain of the largest subunit of RNA polymerase II (3). Further,
CAK or TFIIH-associated CAK phosphorylates several transcription
factors to regulate their activities (e.g., see refs. 22, 23). Inhibition of
CDK7 activity would therefore be expected to inhibit transcription

as well as cell cycle progression. Selective inhibitors should
therefore provide potentially significant tools for dissecting further
the multiple roles of CDK7 and could have utility as anticancer
drugs. Here, we have performed computer modeling of the CDK7
structure to identify potential chemical structures that could act as
selective CDK7 inhibitors. Based on these analyses, we have
identified a novel selective inhibitor of CDK7, named BS-181, which
inhibits phosphorylation of CDK7 substrates and inhibits cancer
cell growth in vitro and in vivo.

Materials and Methods
Computer-aided drug design of BS-181. AMSOL v6.64 was used to
calculate solvation free energies of five preliminary core fragments based on
roscovitine. GLIDE (v 4.5) was used to dock the ligands into the CDK7 (PDB
ID 1UA2) ATP-binding pocket. All manipulations using GLIDE were
performed within the Maestro interface from Schrodinger (v 6.5). The
Protein Preparation workflow in Maestro was first used to add protons and

4

www.aacrjournals.org

assign ionization states to the protein. Following this protocol, a grid
centered on the ligand was generated using the default Glide settings. All
ligands were docked into this grid structure. Dockings were run using
GLIDE SP mode to generate initial poses and then XP and MMGBSA modes
to evaluate docking scores and rank ligands with roscovitine as a reference.
Ten poses were generated for each docking run and the top pose was picked
for evaluation.
General synthetic methods. All manipulations of air- or moisturesensitive materials were carried out in oven- or flame-dried glassware
under an inert atmosphere of nitrogen or argon. Syringes, which were
used to transfer reagents and solvents, were purged with nitrogen before
use. Reaction solvents were distilled from CaH2 (dichloromethane,
toluene, triethylamine), Na/Ph2CO (tetrahydrofuran, diethyl ether), or
obtained as dry or anhydrous from Aldrich Chemical Company (N, Ndimethylformamide, acetonitrile) or BDH (ethanol). Other solvents and
all reagents were obtained from commercial suppliers (Fluka, Aldrich
Chemical Company, and Lancaster Chemicals) and were used as
obtained if purity was >98%. All flash column chromatography
experiments were carried out on BDH silica gel 60, particle size 0.040
to 0.063 mm, unless otherwise stated. TLC was performed on precoated
aluminum-backed or glass-backed plates (Merck Kieselgel 60 F254) and
visualized with UV light (254 nm) or potassium permanganate (KMnO4),
vanillin or phosphomolybdic acid stains as deemed appropriate. Details

of the synthesis of BS-181 are shown in Supplementary Fig. S1 and in
Supplementary Data.
In vitro kinase assays. The purified recombinant CDK2/cycE, CDK4/
cycD1, CDK5/p35NCK, CDK7/CycH/MAT1, and CDK9/CycT were purchased from Proqinase GmbH. Kinase assays were performed according to
manufacturer’s protocols, using substrate peptides purchased from
Proqinase GmbH, as described below. A luciferase assay (PKLight assay;
Cambrex) was used to determine ATP remaining at the end of the kinase
reaction, which provides a measure of kinase activity, according to the
manufacturer’s protocols.
Cell growth assays. All cells were purchased from the American Type
Culture Collection and were routinely cultured in DMEM supplemented
with 10% FCS (First Link). Cell growth was assessed using the sulforhodamine B assay, as described (24).
Flow cytometry. MCF-7 cells were seeded (4  105) in six-well plates in
DMEM containing 10% FCS and allowed to adhere for 24 h, followed by
addition of compounds or DMSO and incubation for 24 h. Cells were
trypsinized, centrifuged at 1,100 rpm for 5 min, and resuspended in 5 mL of
ice-cold PBS, centrifuged as above, gently resuspended in 1 mL ice-cold 70%
ethanol, and incubated at 4jC for 1 h. Cells were washed twice with 5 mL of
ice-cold PBS and resuspended in 100 AL of PBS containing 100 Ag/mL
RNase (Sigma-Aldrich) and 1 mL of 50 Ag/mL propidium iodide (SigmaAldrich) in PBS. Following incubation overnight in the dark at 4jC and
filtering through 70-Am muslin gauze into fluorescence-activated cell
sorting tubes (Becton Dickinson) to remove cell clumps, stained cells were
acquired using the RXP cytomics software on a Beckman Coulter Elite ESP
(Beckman Coulter, High Wycombe) and data were analyzed using Flow Jo
v7.2.5 (Tree Star, Inc.). For dual labeling with propidium iodide and Annexin
V, the cells were trypsinized and collected with the culture medium,
centrifuged at 1,100 rpm for 5 min, and washed twice with 5 mL of ice-cold
PBS containing 2% (w/v) bovine serum albumin (Sigma-Aldrich). Cells were
labeled with Annexin V-FITC using the Annexin V-FITC apoptosis detection
kit I (BD Pharmingen), as per the manufacturer’s instructions. Labeled cells
were acquired within 1 h, by using the RXP cytomics software on a Beckman
Coulter Elite ESP, and the data were analyzed using Flow Jo v7.2.5. Statistical
analysis was performed for three independent experiments, carried out
using the unpaired Student’s t test to determine P values.
Immunoblotting. Cells (1  106) were plated in 10-cm plates and were
treated with compounds after 24 h. Four hours later, cell lysates were
prepared by the addition of 500 AL of hot lysis buffer [4% SDS (w/v), 20%
glycerol (v/v), 0.1% bromophenol blue (w/v), 0.1 mol/L Tris-HCl (pH 6.8),
0.2 mol/L DTT, in H2O], preheated to 100jC. Immunoblotting was
performed as described previously (25), using antibodies for PolII (N-20;
Santa Cruz Biotechnologies), PolII phosphoserine-2, PolII phosphoserine-5,
Rb phosphoserine-795, CDK7, cyclin D1, XIAP, Bcl2, and h-actin from
Abcam plc. Antibodies for Rb, CDK2, CDK4, CDK5, cyclin A, cyclin B, cyclin
E, and Bcl-xL were purchased from New England Biolabs.
Human tumor xenografts. Seven-week-old female nu/nu-BALB/c
athymic nude mice were purchased from Harlan Olac Ltd. All procedures
were approved by the CBS, Imperial College London Ethics Committee, and
were covered by a Government Home Office project license. Before
inoculation of animal with cells, a 0.72-mg 17h-estradiol 60-d release pellet
was implanted s.c. (Innovative Research of America). MCF-7 cells (5  106)
were injected s.c. in not more than 0.1 mL volume into the flank of the
animals. Tumor measurements were performed twice per week, and
volumes were calculated using the formula 1/2 [length (mm)]  [width
(mm)]2. The animals were randomized and when tumors had reached a
volume of 100 to 200 mm3, animals were entered into the different
treatment groups, and treatment with test drug or vehicle control was
initiated. Animals were treated with compound twice daily by i.p. injection
for a total of 14 d. The compounds were prepared in the vehicle of 10%
DMSO/50 mmol/L HCl/5% Tween 20/85% saline. Control mice were
injected with the vehicle. Compounds were administered by exact body
weight, with the injection volume being not more than 0.2 mL. At the end of
the 14-d treatment period, the mice were sacrificed. Throughout the 14-d
treatment period, animal weights were determined each day and tumor
volumes were determined on alternate days.

Results
Computer-aided drug design approach for the development
of potential CDK7 inhibitors. To design CDK7 inhibitors,
computational analysis for selection of an alternative core
heterocyclic ring structure able to preserve side chain functionality
of roscovitine, offer synthetic access, and incorporate suitable
solubility properties was carried out. Five motifs (Fig. 1A) were
evaluated using Amsol 6.6, with the expectation that the structure
with the least favorable aqueous solvation energy would be
transferred most readily into the hydrophobic kinase active site
pocket. The calculated free energies of solvation suggested that
pyrazolopyrimidine 1 would be soluble, but the core structure most
readily expelled from the water environment and into the protein.
Accordingly, this motif was selected for synthetic modification.
Docking studies performed using Glide (26, 27) also yielded the best
Glide scores for pyrazolopyrimidine 1 compared with the other
templates, including roscovitine (Supplementary Table S1).
A key observation in preliminary studies was that 1 with the same
side chains as roscovitine docked into the CDK7 active site in the
same orientation as the latter, but with slightly better scores and
substantially more favorable solvation energies. The best pose for 1 is
similar to that for other pyrazolopyrimidines (28). The 3-isopropyl
group protrudes into the cavity formed by the gatekeeper Phe91. The
N1 and N6 centers form hydrogen bonds with backbone atoms of
Met94 in the hinge region of the kinase, whereas the side chain
hydroxyl makes a hydrogen bond with Asn141 (Fig. 1B).
The docked pose suggested that 1 is incapable of completely
occupying the CDK7 active site pocket. Left unused was a sector in
the back of the cleft occupied by two lysines (Lys41 and Lys138) and
a phosphorylated threonine (Thr170). In an attempt to exploit the
lipophilic nature of this subsite, the hydroxy ethyl moiety of 1
borrowed from roscovitine was excised and the resulting propyl
side chain was extended. Nonpolar alkyl linkers of different chain
length terminating in a variety of polar groups attached to the NH
at the C2 position were conceived and docked. A six-carbon linker
with a primary amine terminus (Fig. 1C) delivered the best docking
score and suggested a considerable affinity improvement relative to
roscovitine. At the same time, the corresponding Glide pose was
similar to that for 1. In addition to hydrogen bonds in the hinge
region, the protonated distal amine was predicted to participate in

strong electrostatic interactions with the phosphate group of
Thr170 and the backbone carbonyl of Glu20. Simultaneously, the sixcarbon linker exhibited productive van der Waals contacts with the
floor of the kinase binding pocket (Fig. 1C). The same structure was
estimated to possess a favorable solvation energy.
Additional docking studies also indicated the structure to favor
CDK7 relative to CDK2 (PDB ID: 1B38), CDK5 (PDB ID: 1UNL), and
CDK6 (PDB ID: 1XO2), suggesting possible selectivity (Supplementary Table S2). The relative docking scores were confirmed by
induced-fit docking.
Synthesis of BS-181 and in vitro kinase inhibition. BS-181
was synthesized from dichloropyrazolo[1,5-a]pyrimidine 2 (29)
by sequential selective substitution of the C-7 chloride using
benzylamine, Boc protection, palladium-catalyzed displacement
of the C-5 chloride using di-Boc-1,6-hexanediamine under
Buchwald-Hartwig reaction conditions (30), and deprotection in
acidic methanol (Supplementary Fig. S1). Inhibition of CDK7
activity was measured by incubation of increasing amounts of
BS-181 with purified recombinant CDK7/CycH/MAT1 complex,
followed by measurement of free ATP remaining in the reaction
using a luciferase assay (PKLight, Cambrex), luciferase activity
therefore providing a measure of inhibition of CDK7 activity.
BS-181 inhibited CDK7 activity with an IC50 of 21 nmol/L (Table 1;
Supplementary Data Fig. S2), whereas the IC50 achieved with
roscovitine was 510 nmol/L, in agreement with previous reports
for inhibition of CDK7 by roscovitine (13). The IC50 values
for inhibition of CDK1/cycB, CDK4/cycD1, CDK5/p35NCK,
CDK6/cycD1, and CDK9/cycT by BS-181 were considerably higher
than 1 Amol/L, with inhibition of CDK2/cycE having an IC50 of
880 nmol/L, f40-fold higher than the IC50 for CDK7.
Seventy protein kinases from many different classes were tested
for inhibition by BS-181. Some inhibition of the activities of several
kinases was observed using high concentrations (10 Amol/L) of BS-

www.aacrjournals.org

181 (Supplementary Table S5). Performing IC50 measurements for
those kinases that showed the greatest inhibition, CDK2/cycA, CK1,
and DYRK1A, showed an IC50 of 730 nmol/L, 7.36 Amol/L, and 2.3
Amol/L, respectively. These data confirm that BS-181 is a highly
selective inhibitor of CDK7 activity.
BS-181 promotes cell cycle arrest and inhibits cancer cell
growth. To assess the antiproliferative activity of BS-181, a panel of
cell lines representing a range of tumor types, including breast,
lung, prostate, and colorectal cancer, were treated with increasing
concentrations of BS-181 for 72 hours. Determination of proliferation using the sulforhodamine B assay showed that growth was
inhibited for all cell lines tested, with IC50 values ranging from 11.5
to 37 Amol/L (Table 2). The growth inhibition observed for BS-181
was similar to that observed for roscovitine, which gave IC50 values
in the range of 8 to 33.5 Amol/L.
Immunoblotting of whole cell lysates prepared from MCF-7 cells
treated with BS-181 showed inhibition of phosphorylation of the
RNA polymerase II COOH-terminal domain (CTD) at the wellestablished CDK7 phosphorylation site, namely serine 5 (P-Ser5;
Fig. 2A). Densitometric analysis of the immunoblotting results
of three independent experiments indicated that the IC50 of
inhibition of Ser5 phosphorylation is 9 Amol/L, whereas 50%
inhibition of Ser5 phosphorylation by roscovitine was not reached
at 50 Amol/L. Serine 2 in the CTD, which is not believed to be a
substrate for CDK7, but is a substrate for CDK9 and can be
phosphorylated by CDK2, was inhibited to a greater extent by
roscovitine than by BS-181. BS-181 also inhibited RB phosphorylation at Ser795 and Ser821 with an apparent IC50 of 15 Amol/L
(Fig. 2B), similar to the IC50 obtained for P-Ser2 inhibition.
Immunoblotting for CDKs and cyclins following BS-181 or
roscovitine treatment for 4 hours showed down-regulation of CDK4
and cyclin D1 (Fig. 2C), with levels of the other CDKs and cyclins
remaining unaffected. Additionally, levels of the antiapoptotic

proteins XIAP and Bcl-xL was reduced by BS-181, with Bcl-2 levels
being unchanged.
Treatment with low concentrations of BS-181 for 24 hours showed
an increase in cells in G1, accompanied by a reduction in cell numbers
in S and G2-M (Fig. 3A; Supplementary Fig. S3). At higher concentrations, however, cells accumulated in the sub-G1, indicative of
apoptosis. This was confirmed by Annexin V staining of cells following
BS-181 treatment for 24 hours, with 30% and 83% of cells staining
positive for Annexin V with 25 and 50 Amol/L BS-181, respectively
(Fig. 3B). No significant apoptosis was observed for roscovitine.
In vivo pharmacokinetic studies and tumor growth
inhibition. The maximum tolerated single dose for BS-181 given
i.p. was determined as 30 mg/kg, with 10 and 20 mg/kg being well
tolerated (data not shown). For xenograft tumor growth inhibition
studies, therefore, the animals were injected i.p. twice daily with
5 or 10 mg/kg, to give total daily doses of 10 or 20 mg/kg over a
period of 14 days. Tumor growth was inhibited in a dose-dependent
manner, with 25% and 50% reduction in tumor growth, compared
with the control group, for 10 and 20 mg/kg/d doses of BS-181,
respectively (Fig. 4A). At these doses, there was no apparent
toxicity, as judged by lack of significant adverse effects on animal
weights (Fig. 4B).
I.v. and i.p. administration of 10 mg/kg BS-181 showed rapid
clearance (Supplementary Data Fig. S4). The terminal half-lives
were 405 and 343 minutes for i.p. and i.v. administration,
respectively, with the measured plasma concentration at 15
minutes of 1,950 (SE = 203) and 2,530 (SE = 269) ng/mL,
respectively, and bioavailability being 37% for i.p. administration
of BS-181 (Supplementary Tables S3 and S4).

Discussion
We show here that BS-181 selectively inhibits CDK7 in vitro and
treatment of MCF-7 cells results in inhibition of phosphorylation

of the CDK7 substrate, Ser5, in the RNA polymerase II CTD. Further,
BS-181 inhibits cell proliferation in vitro and in vivo. Together,
these findings indicate that CDK7 is a potential target for cancer
therapy.
The modeling predictions were substantiated when BS-181
proved to be a more potent and selective CDK7 inhibitor than
roscovitine. For example, as shown here, roscovitine is an inhibitor
of CDK2, CDK5, CDK7, and CDK9, with IC50 values of 100, 240, 510,
and 1,200 nmol/L, respectively. BS-181, on the other hand, exhibits
a substantially higher preference for CDK7 with an IC50 value of
21 nmol/L. Excellent selectivity against CDK2, CDK5, and CDK9
is shown by high IC50 values of 880, 3,000, and 4,200 nmol/L,
respectively. BS-181 also fails to block CDK1, CDK4, and CDK6,
with IC50 values being >5,000 nmol/L. As such, BS-181 is a highly
selective CDK inhibitor and is the most potent CDK7 inhibitor
described to date.
It is difficult to rationalize computationally the selectivity of
BS-181 for CDK7 over CDK2 and CDK5 in terms of specific
ligand-protein interactions. However, different packing interactions of the nonpolar isopropyl side chain at C-3 in BS-181 with
the amino acids in the kinase pocket may aid in explaining the
phenomenon. For example, the 3-isopropyl side chain protrudes
into a cavity formed in part by the important gatekeeper
residues Phe91 and the C4 carbon chain of Lys41 in both CDK2
and CDK7. However, the hydrophobic packing of the two
residues is much tighter in the case of CDK7 (Fig. 1D) than it
is in CDK2 (Fig. 1E). This volume-based realignment in the
gatekeeper sector of the binding site may well exert a subtle
effect that influences selectivity.
The first generation of general CDK inhibitors, such as
olomoucine, showed activity against CDK1, CDK2, and CDK5.
This was followed by the description of compounds such as
UCN-01, which although showing antitumor activity showed side
effects that limited their use. Other compounds include

flavopiridol, which is moderately selective against CDK4, CDK6,
and CDK1, and CINK4, which is active against CDK4 and CDK6.
Paullones have also been shown to have good selectivity against
CDK1, CDK2, and CDK5. P276-00 is active against CDK9, with
some activity against CDK4 and CDK1 (17, 31). It is only
recently, however, that the concept of inhibition of transcriptional control by inhibiting CDK7 or CDK9 has gained some
popularity. Inhibition of these kinases may be expected to be
particularly important for transcripts that have a short half-life.
Examples include transcripts for bcl-2, cyclin D, Mcl-1, and other
genes involved in cell cycle progression and apoptosis. For
example, flavopiridol, the most potent described inhibitor of
CDK9, inhibits phosphorylation of the PolII CTD at Ser2 and Ser5
(32, 33) and reduces expression of the antiapoptotic Mcl-1 gene
in primary CLL cells (34). Roscovitine has also been shown to
inhibit PolII Ser2 and Ser5 phosphorylation and roscovitine
(Seliciclib) has been evaluated in a phase 1 study (10). This study

showed that the dose-limiting toxicity was fatigue, sickness, and
hypokalemia and hyponatremia, with some patients showing
evidence of renal failure. No responses were seen although
disease stabilization was seen in some patients; the compound
was insufficiently active and bioavailable to inhibit PolII
phosphorylation. Clinical trials in chronic lymphocytic leukemia
(CLL), lymphoma, and multiple myeloma are ongoing for
flavopiridol; however, several studies have failed to show clinical
responses, although more recent studies in CLL are encouraging
and suggest that flavopiridol synergizes with other compounds
such as imatinib and tumor necrosis factor–inducing compounds
in leukemia ( for review and references, see ref. 17).
BS-181 inhibits phosphorylation of the PolII CTD at Ser5, a
known CDK7 substrate. Although CDK7 does not target Ser2,
BS-181 inhibited Ser2 phosphorylation, likely through inhibition
of CDK2 and CDK9. Indeed, Ser5 inhibition was observed at
lower concentrations of BS-181 than the concentrations required
for inhibition of Ser2 phosphorylation. In this respect, roscovitine, which is a more potent inhibitor of CDK2 and CDK9 than
BS-181, inhibited Ser2 phosphorylation at lower concentrations
than BS-181, but only poorly inhibited Ser5 phosphorylation.
Together, these findings suggest that CDK7 is a key target of
BS-181 in MCF-7 cells. Inhibition of Rb phosphorylation was also
observed, but the inhibition was similar to that observed for
Ser2 of PolII, suggesting that reduction in Rb phosphorylation
was indirect.
As outlined above, inhibition of CDK7 and CDK9 has been linked
to down-regulation of cyclin D1, bcl-2, and Mcl-1. BS-181 treatment
for as little as 4 hours reduced cyclin D1, XIAP, and Bcl-xL
expression, although Bcl-2 levels were only slightly reduced.
Interestingly, CDK4 levels were also reduced. Together, these data
may explain the G1 arrest and potent apoptosis brought about by
BS-181 treatment of MCF-7 cells. Transcriptional inhibitors that
block PolII activity, such as a-amanitin and actinomycin D, as well
as compounds that inhibit PolII phosphorylation, such as 5,6dichloro-1-h-D-ribofuranosylbenzimidazole (DRB), have been
shown to induce apoptosis by activating p53 (35). Treatment of
p53-null HCT116 cells (36) showed considerably reduced, albeit
significant, induction of apoptosis by BS-181, compared with p53positive HCT116 cells (Supplementary Fig. S5), suggesting that p53
is important for BS-181–mediated apoptosis, as described previously for DRB (37). Similarly, greater apoptosis was observed in the
p53-positive U2OS osteosarcoma line, when compared with the
p53-negative SaOS2 osteosarcoma line (Supplementary Fig. S6).
Together, these findings indicate that p53 is important but not
essential for BS-181–induced apoptosis.
I.p. injection of BS-181 inhibited MCF-7 tumor xenografts,
lending further support to a potential utility of CDK7 inhibitors in
cancer treatment. Pharmacokinetic studies showed rapid clearance
of BS-181 administered i.p. or i.v. In the case of i.p. administration,
the maximal blood concentration of BS-181 was 1,317 ng/mL.
Further, bioavailability was only 37%, indicating a need for further
refinement of the BS-181 structure to improve stability and
bioavailability. As it stands, the studies described here indicate
that continuous i.v. infusion or repeated administration is needed
for further in vivo evaluation. The observed efficacy, despite the low
plasma levels (lower than the IC50 for growth inhibition in vitro),
could therefore be due, at least in part, to more active metabolites
generated following i.p. administration. Elucidation of the structures of possible metabolites and their activities will be the subject
of future studies.

Figure 4. BS-181 inhibits the growth of MCF-7 tumors in nude mice. Randomized MCF-7 tumor-bearing mice were injected i.p. twice daily with 5 or 10 mg/kg BS-181,
giving a total daily dose of 10 or 20 mg/kg/d, respectively, over a period of 14 d. Mouse weights were determined daily, tumor volumes being measured every 2 d.
A, the change in tumor volume was determined for each animal, as tumor volume relative to the tumor volume of each animal at day 1. The line graphs show the mean
tumor volumes for the animals in each treatment group. Error bars, SE. Asterisks depict the statistical significance of the differences between the control group
and each of the BS-181 treatment groups, carried out using Student’s t test. B, animal weights, provided as percentage change relative to the animal weights at day 1.
Error bars, SE.

In summary, we have discovered the most potent CDK7selective inhibitor to date by computer-aided drug design. BS181 selectively exhibited nanomolar enzymatic potency and
inhibited all cell lines tested at low micromolar concentrations.
For the given route of administration (37% bioavailability), the
drug showed in vivo activity in human tumor xenografts. BS-181
warrants further preclinical and clinical evaluation as a
candidate cancer therapeutic.
