ABSTRACT
Aberrant activation of the HGF/MET signaling axis has been strongly implicated in
the malignant transformation and progression of gastroesophageal cancer (GEC). MET
receptor overexpression in tumor samples from GEC patients has been consistently
correlated with an aggressive metastatic phenotype and poor prognosis. In preclinical
GEC models, abrogation of HGF/MET signaling has been shown to induce tumor
regression as well as inhibition of metastatic dissemination. Promising clinical results
in patient subsets in which MET is overexpressed have spurned several randomized
studies of HGF/MET-directed agents, including two pivotal global Phase III trials.
Available data highlight the need for predictive biomarkers in order to select patients
most likely to benefit from HGF/MET inhibition. In this review, we discuss the current
knowledge of mechanisms of MET activation in GEC, the current status of the clinical
evaluation of MET-targeted therapies in GEC, characteristics of ongoing randomized
GEC trials and the associated efforts to identify and validate biomarkers. We also
discuss the considerations and challenges for HGF/MET inhibitor drug development
in the GEC setting.

INTRODUCTION

world over the last two decades while remaining relatively
uncommon in Asia [3].
Because of its insidious nature, patients newly
diagnosed with GEC often present with advanced
incurable disease. For those presenting with potentially
resectable cancer that undergo surgery with curative
intent in conjunction with perioperative chemotherapy
or post-operative chemoradiation, overall survival ranges
from 30-35% at five years and recurrence within two
years following surgery is commonplace [4-6]. Thus, a
majority of patients with GEC will ultimately be treated
for metastatic disease.
Patients with metastatic GEC (mGEC) can
be subdivided into two populations based on HER2
expression status [7]. HER2-positive tumors represent 1015% of cases and are defined by overexpression of HER2
protein with or without concomitant amplification of its
gene ERBB2. For patients with HER2-positive disease,
the phase III ToGA trial demonstrated clinically and
statistically significant improvements in response rate,

Gastroesophageal adenocarcinoma (GEC) is a
common and highly morbid malignancy accounting for
~1 million cases and in excess of 700,000 cancer-related
deaths annually [1]. Peak GEC incidence occurs in the
seventh decade and the disease is approximately twice as
common in men compared to women. GEC can be subdivided according to histological appearance into diffuse
(undifferentiated) and intestinal (well differentiated) types
according to the Lauren classification [2]. There is marked
geographic variation with respect to epidemiology and
clinical presentation. Approximately 70% of deaths due
to GEC occur in developing countries with the highest
incidence noted in Asia, Eastern Europe and South
America and the lowest rates seen in the United States
and Western Europe. While the global incidence of distal
gastric adenocarcinoma has steadily declined over time,
the incidence of distal oesophageal or gastroesophageal
junction (GEJ) tumors have risen sharply in the Western

progression-free survival (PFS) and OS with the addition
of trastuzumab to a cisplatin–fluoropyrimidine doublet
(median OS 13.8 versus 11.1 months, HR 0.74, 95% CI,
0.60–0.91; P = 0.0048) [8]. Trastuzumab is now a standard
first-line treatment option for patients with HER2-positive
advanced or metastatic GEC.
For patients with HER2-negative GEC, doublet or
triplet combination chemotherapy remains the mainstay of
treatment [7, 9, 10]. For such patients, prognosis remains
dismal with median survival following first-line treatment
ranging from 9-11 months and a 5-year survival rate of less
than 10% [11, 12]. In patients of adequate performance
status, second-line chemotherapy has been associated with
proven improvements in OS and quality of life compared
with best supportive care [7]. In the second-line setting,
ramucirumab, a monoclonal antibody targeting VEGFR2
(Lilly) has been recently been shown to extend survival
and may become a standard targeted treatment option for
patients who have relapsed following first-line treatment.
Effective delivery of conventional cytotoxic therapy
is challenging in the setting of GEC by virtue of both
substantial disease-related morbidity and the advanced
age of patients [13]. These challenges in cytotoxic drug
delivery coupled with its limited efficacy means that novel
therapeutic modalities are urgently needed to improve
clinical outcomes for patients with advanced GEC.
As with other cancers, recent progress in the
molecular profiling of GEC has lead to the design of
several targeted therapies that are currently in clinical
development [13, 14]. Gastric tumours are thought to be
molecularly diverse and harbour alterations in several key
oncogenes and kinase pathways that may be amenable to
pharmacologic inhibition [15, 16]. With the exception of
trastuzumab (Herceptin®, Genentech) in HER2-positive
GEC and potentially ramucirumab in the relapsed setting,
recent Phase III studies of other agents targeting oncogenic
mediators such as VEGF-A, EGFR and mTOR in nonenriched patient populations have not been shown to
improve survival [13, 17-19]. Of the remaining druggable
targets thought to play a role in GEC, agents targeting
the MET receptor tyrosine kinase are the currently being
subjected to intensive clinical investigation.
This Review will focus on the anti-MET agents
currently in late stage clinical development in advanced/
metastatic GEC. The Review summarizes the available
data as well as the current status of ongoing randomized
studies of MET-directed agents. Since identification of
tumours most likely to respond to MET pathway blockade
is a key component of therapeutic development, we
also discuss the issues and challenges associated with
identification of MET biomarkers to aid patient selection.

only known ligand. MET is predominantly expressed on
cells of epithelial origin but is also found on non-epithelial
tissues such as endothelium, neuronal cells, melanocytes
and hematopoietic cells. MET activation induces
complex cellular signaling mediated through a variety of
transduction pathways driven by a diverse array of adaptors
and downstream effectors (for review see Gherardi et al
[20]). MET primarily signals through RAS-MAPK and
PI3K-Akt pathways to evoke pleiotropic cellular processes
including motility, survival, proliferation, morphogenesis
and angiogenesis that collectively orchestrate a biological
program known as “invasive growth” [20-22]. Under
physiological conditions, MET-driven invasive growth
is tightly regulated and plays a key role in tissue growth
and repair. Not surprisingly, cancer cells are able to hijack
the invasive growth program in order to propagate an
invasive and metastatic phenotype [20]. Aberrant HGF/
MET activation occurs in multiple types of malignancies,
including GEC, via several mechanisms including
overexpression, focal gene amplification, gene copy
number gain, activating mutations, RTK transactivation
and autocrine or paracrine signaling (www.vai.org/met)
[20, 21, 23].
Dysregulated HGF/MET signaling is commonly
seen in GEC. Signal activation by HGF in GEC cell lines
and tumor models promotes tumorigenesis and metastases.
The potentiated capacity for metastatic transformation
upon MET activation has been linked with an increased
capacity for epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)
and inhibiting detachment-mediated apoptosis (anoikis)
in GEC models [24]. Perturbation of HGF/MET signaling
with anti-HGF antibodies or MET kinase inhibitors
attenuates both tumor growth and metastatic dissemination
in both GEC cell lines and animal models [24-26]. As
HGF and MET mutations are exceedingly rare in GEC
[27, 28], activation of MET is thought to be primarily
a result of receptor overexpression and/or genomic
upregulation (gene copy number gain or amplification).
Overexpression of MET protein or transcript as measured
by immunohistochemistry (IHC) or RT-PCR respectively
is relatively common in GEC tissue. Recent retrospective
IHC studies on gastric tumor tissues obtained following
tumor resections have reported MET overexpression
in 4% - 63% of cases [29-34]. On the other hand, focal
MET gene amplification appears rare in treatment-naïve
gastric tumors with reported incidences of between 0 – 5%
[31, 35, 36]. MET receptor overexpression, copy number
gain or amplification has been associated with a more
aggressive phenotype and diminished survival in multiple
retrospective patient series. [29, 31, 35-39] In vitro, METamplified GEC cells are acutely sensitive to HGF/MET
pathway blockade [40, 41].
In addition to oncogenesis and malignant
transformation, aberrant MET signaling has been
associated with in vitro resistance to cytotoxic agents
known to be active in GEC [42, 43].

prevents HGF binding to MET, inhibiting ligand-induced
activation of the intracellular domain, thus blocking
downstream MET signaling events [45]. Onartuzumab
was specifically designed as a monovalent antibody to
avoid agonistic activity that may occur when a bivalent
antibody binds two MET molecules [45].
The strongest clinical evidence supporting
HGF/MET inhibition in GEC comes from a firstline randomized, placebo-controlled Phase II study
of rilotumumab in combination with platinum-based
chemotherapy in patients with advanced GEC. In this
three arm trial, 121 patients with unresectable locally
advanced or metastatic disease were randomized to
epirubicin, capecitabine and cisplatin (ECX) plus
placebo (n = 39) or ECX plus either 7.5-mg/kg (n=40)
or 15-mg/kg rilotumumab (n=42). Patients were primarily
drawn from Western countries (Western and Eastern
Europe, US and Australia) with only a minority (17%)
from Asia. The combination of rilotumumab (low and
high doses combined) plus ECX marginally improved
both PFS (HR = 0.64) and OS (HR = 0.73) in the
intention-to-treat population. Toxicities more frequently
seen with rilotumumab included peripheral edema,
thrombocytopenia, neutropenia and deep vein thrombosis
(DVT). Of note, peripheral edema is a frequently reported
toxicity associated anti-HGF/MET antibodies across
multiple tumor types and combination regimens [46].
The relationship between MET expression and
clinical outcomes were also evaluated in this trial [47].
Archival resection or biopsy specimens suitable for IHC
(76% of samples) were tested for MET expression using a
proprietary IHC assay. Of the IHC-evaluable patients, 42%
were classified as being METHigh i.e. weak (1+) or stronger

Clinical experience with MET pathway inhibitors
in GEC
Several drugs targeting the HGF/MET signaling
axis, including both antibodies and small molecule
inhibitors have been evaluated in the clinic. Antibodies
directed against either HGF or MET prevent ligandreceptor interaction and consequently impact downstream
MET signaling (Figure 1). Small molecule MET kinase
inhibitors are generally designed to target the active site of
the receptor, inhibiting phosphorylation and recruitment of
signaling effectors (Figure 1).

Monoclonal antibodies
Both rilotumumab (AMG102; Amgen) and
onartuzumab (MetMAb; Genentech) are in the latter
stages of clinical development for GEC. The primary
hypothesis being tested in both studies is whether addition
of HGF/MET-targeted therapy to standard platinumbased chemotherapy improves survival in patients with
gastroesophageal tumors overexpressing MET.
Rilotumumab is a fully human monoclonal IgG2
antibody that binds HGF and prevents its binding
to the MET receptor and subsequent signaling [44].
Onartuzumab is a monovalent (one-armed), humanized
monoclonal antibody specific for an epitope in the HGF
binding domain of the MET receptor. Onartuzumab

Figure 1: The HGF/MET axis and targeted therapy strategies. (A) The MET receptor is activated at the plasma membrane
through the binding of HGF to the extracellular domain of MET. Upon dimerization, kinase activation results in trans-autophosphorylation
and binding of adaptor proteins, forming scaffolds for recruitment and activation of signaling proteins. MET can then signal through RASMAPK, PI3K-AKT, RAC1, and PAK pathways to drive distinct cellular responses including proliferation, survival, motility, invasiveness,
and stimulation of angiogenesis. (B) Three pharmacologic approaches are currently being developed as inhibitors of MET signaling
including anti-HGF antibodies, monovalent (one-armed) anti-MET antibodies and small molecule MET kinase inhibitors.

MET staining in >50% of malignant cells. Patients with
METHigh tumors appeared to experience marked clinical
benefit from the addition of HGF-targeted therapy to
chemotherapy with respect to PFS and OS compared to
those treated with chemotherapy alone (HROS = 0.29, p
= 0.012). On the other hand, worse clinical outcomes
were observed in the METLow patient subpopulation
receiving anti-HGF therapy compared to those receiving
chemotherapy only (HR = 1.84, p-value not reported).
Interestingly, a similar trend towards worsened clinical
outcomes in MET-negative patients was also observed in
study of rilotumumab in patients with castration-resistant
prostate cancer [48]. When comparing patients with
METHigh and METLow tumors receiving chemotherapy
alone, the IHC analysis confirmed that high MET
expression is a marker of poor prognosis as suggested by
prior retrospective analyses. These data provide clinical
proof-of-concept supporting HGF/MET axis targeting in
GEC and suggest that MET receptor expression measured
by IHC could function as a predictive biomarker for
patient selection.
In a Phase I study dose-escalation study of
onartuzumab in patients with various locally advanced
or metastatic solid tumors, a sustained complete response
(>2 years) was noted in a patient with chemorefractory
GEC with hepatic metastases [49, 50]. Interestingly, serial
correlative blood and tissue studies in this patient showed
MET gene polysomy, moderate MET expression by IHC
and a remarkably high baseline serum HGF level. In
addition, intratumoral coexpression of both HGF and MET
was observed possibly indicating autocrine signaling [49].

important insights into the biologic underpinnings of
clinical response to MET blockade in patients with GEC
[49].

Small molecule MET tyrosine kinase inhibitors
(TKIs)
Several early phase studies have evaluated antiMET TKIs in patients with GEC, with mixed results.
Crizotinib, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor that targets both
ALK and MET tyrosine kinases, was originally developed
as a MET-specific inhibitor but has been FDA-approved
for use in ALK-positive NSCLC. Single-agent clinical
responses to crizotinib were noted in two of four patients
with relapsed mGEC and increased MET copy number
(≥5 copies) [35]. Conversely, a single-arm Phase II study
of foretinib (an oral multikinase inhibitor targeting MET,
RON, AXL, TIE-2, and VEGFR2 receptors) failed to
demonstrate anti-tumor activity in molecularly-unselected
patients with metastatic GEC or those with MET amplified
tumors [51]. Similarly, tivantinib (ARQ197, Arqule)
monotherapy failed to show clinical activity in a cohort
of pre-treated metastatic patients [52]. It should be noted
that the mechanisms underlying the antitumor effects
of tivantinib are an area of controversy in the literature
with recent reports suggesting that antineoplastic activity
is primarily attributable to perturbation of microtubule
dynamics versus selective MET kinase inhibition [53, 54].

of

HGF/MET

Patients (planned n=800) are randomized 1:1 to receive
either mFOLFOX6 (oxaliplatin: 85 mg/m2, IV, day 1;
leucovorin: 400 mg/m2, IV, day 1; 5-FU: 400 mg/m2 bolus
followed by 2400 mg/m2 over 48 hours starting on day
1) with onartuzumab (10 mg/kg, IV, on day 1, every 14
days) or mFOLFOX6 plus placebo. A maximum of 12
cycles of mFOLFOX6 are permitted. From cycle thirteen
onwards, onartuzumab or placebo is continued until
disease progression. Randomization is stratified by MET
expression status, world region (Asia Pacific vs. Rest of
World) and history of prior gastrectomy. Only patients
with tumors centrally classified as both HER2-negative
and MET-positive (by IHC) are eligible. For the purposes
of determining eligibility, a MET positive tumor is defined
when ≥50% of malignant cells express MET (cytoplasmic
and/or membranous staining) at weak, moderate or strong
intensity.
The co-primary endpoint of this study is OS in all
patients (ITT) and a subgroup of patients with MET IHC
scores of 2+ or 3+. Secondary endpoints include PFS,
ORR, safety as well as correlative tissue and biomarker
studies.
YO28252 is a multicentre, randomized, placebocontrolled Phase II study of onartuzumab in combination
with mFOLFOX6 being run in parallel with MetGastric
(NCT01590719). Patients (planned n=120) from the
US or Asia-Pacific are randomized 1:1 to mFOLFOX6
in combination with either placebo or onartuzumab.
While the Phase II study design and patient population
is largely similar to MetGastric, there are some important
differences. Unlike MetGastric, patients are not required to
have MET-positive disease to be eligible for participation
as the primary purpose of the study is to evaluate the
clinical profile of onartuzumab in both MET-positive
and MET-negative tumors. Randomization is according
to Lauren histologic subtype (intestinal/not evaluable
vs. diffuse/mixed) and history of prior gastrectomy. The
primary endpoint is PFS in both the ITT population and
those defined prior to unblinding as MET-positive by IHC.
Key secondary endpoints include OS, ORR, safety and
pharmacokinetics.

The evidence linking aberrant HGF/MET signaling
to gastric tumorigenesis coupled with encouraging
early clinical results has triggered significant clinical
development efforts (Table 1). Phase III trials for both
rilotumumab and onartuzumab are currently enrolling
patients. To our knowledge, no randomized trials involving
MET TKIs are currently open at the time of writing.

Rilotumumab
RILOMET-1 is a randomized, global, doubleblind, placebo-controlled Phase III study of rilotumumab
in combination with ECX as first-line treatment for
advanced MET-positive GEC (NCT01697072) [55].
Patients (planned n=450) are randomized 1:1 to ECX
(epirubicin 50 mg/m2 IV on day 1, cisplatin 60 mg/m2 IV
on day 1, and oral capecitabine 625 mg/m2 twice daily on
days 1−21) plus double-blind rilotumumab (15 mg/kg IV)
or placebo on a three-weekly cycle. Patients can receive
up to ten cycles of ECX, with Rilotumumab or placebo
continued until disease progression. Randomization is
stratified according to disease extent (locally advanced
or metastatic) and ECOG score (0 vs. 1). Eligibility
is restricted to patients with MET positive and HER2
negative tumors.
The primary endpoint is OS. Key secondary
endpoints include PFS, objective response rate (ORR), OS
in MET expression tertiles, safety, and pharmacokinetics.
RILOMET-1 is being conducted in approximately 180
sites in Australia, Europe, Africa, North America and
South America.
The MEGA (Met or EGFR inhibition in
Gastroesophageal Adenocarcinoma) study is a
randomized Phase II study evaluating the addition
of either Rilotumumab or panitumumab (anti-EGFR
monoclonal antibody) to mFOLFOX6 as first-line
treatment for advanced GEC. Patients from 30 French
sites (planned n=165) are randomized 1:1 to mFOLFOX6
alone or combined with either panitumumab (6 mg/kg)
or rilotumumab (10 mg/kg). Randomization is stratified
by extent of disease (locally advanced vs. metastatic),
histologic subtype (signet ring/diffuse vs. intestinal/
mixed) and study center. The primary endpoint is 4-month
PFS and key secondary endpoints include ORR, PFS, OS
and safety.

MET biomarkers in GEC
One of the key challenges associated with the
development of targeted therapeutics is identifying tumors
that are sensitive as well as patients likely to derive clinical
benefit [14]. Critical to this process is the identification
and validation of potential predictive biomarkers to tailor
treatment. The development of biomarker assays with
good specificity and sensitivity to detect these markers in
clinical specimens, as well as the inclusion of such tests
in both early stage and registration-enabled clinical trials
to determine the clinical utility of the diagnostic test is
critical. The frequency of MET pathway aberrations and
their prognostic potential in GEC support the development

development (Figure 2). In GEC, multiple biomarker

be conducted on biopsy specimens and not resected
samples. It is conceivable that differences may exist in
MET expression levels measured in biopsy specimens
compared to that seen in resected tissue. Differences in
IHC staining between biopsy and resection samples with
respect to other IHC markers have been noted [59-61] and
if similar observations are made with MET; this could
have implications for the use of MET IHC as a companion
diagnostic.
In clinical development, both rilotumumab and
onartuzumab are being developed in GEC using a strategy
of identifying MET-positive patients by means of a
centrally conducted IHC assay on FFPE tissue (Figure
3). For both drugs, the IHC test is being developed as a
companion diagnostic. This strategy is based on Phase II
studies in NSCLC (onartuzumab) and GEC (rilotumumab)
suggesting that MET overexpression is predictive of
clinical benefit from anti-HGF/MET therapy [47, 62, 63].
Study OAM4558g was a randomized Phase II study
in which patients with relapsed NSCLC were randomized
to receive onartuzumab plus erlotinib (Tarceva®, a smallmolecule inhibitor of EGFR) or erlotinib alone [62]. In
order to evaluate MET expression, an IHC assay was
developed utilizing the rabbit monoclonal antibody SP44
(Ventana Medical Systems, Tucson, AZ; cat No. 7904430) [57]. Due to intratumoral heterogeneity an IHC
scoring algorithm was developed incorporating estimates
of the proportion of malignant cells showing staining
for MET at pre-defined intensity levels. MET IHC was
performed on archival resection or biopsy specimens in
all randomized patients. MET-positive cases were defined
prospectively (prior to study unblinding) as those in
which >50% of tumor cells expressed MET at moderate
or strong Cytoplasmic and/or membrane intensity.
Analysis of efficacy showed that clinical benefit (PFS and
OS) was confined to patients with MET-positive tumors
[62]. Conversely, clinical outcomes were worse in MET-

MET overexpression
MET protein expression using IHC has been
extensively studied in GEC with most studies reporting
that MET overexpression is associated with poor patient
survival (www.vai.org/met) [38]. Some, but not all, of
these studies have suggested a relationship between MET
overexpression and histologic subtype, more advanced
TNM stage or the incidence of local or distant metastases
(www.vai.org/met). In the absence of clinical validation
there is currently no consensus on scoring criteria for MET
IHC tests. Studies using IHC to evaluate the prognostic
impact of MET expression have primarily utilized
retrospective analyses of variably sized and annotated
clinical cohorts, resulting in a high degree of variability
in the published findings with respect to the prevalence of
MET overexpression and/or its prognostic implications.
Potential sources of variability include the use of
different sample types, inter-reader variation, primary and
secondary antibodies, staining protocols, scoring methods
as well as differences in tissue processing and storage [57,
58]. Furthermore, the IHC reagents used in these studies
come with varying degrees of validation with respect to
specificity and sensitivity. The source of the diagnostic
tissue sample could also be important to consider. Almost
all published MET IHC studies have been conducted
using tissue derived from gastric tumor resections. Since
a large body of patients with GEC present with advanced
disease and do not proceed to surgery, it is likely that
a significant proportion of diagnostic testing would

negative patients treated with onartuzumab plus erlotinib.
As a result of this observation the design of the pivotal
Phase III study (MetLung; NCT1234567) was restricted
to only MET-positive patients [64].
Collectively these data suggest that MET IHC is a
valid biomarker with which to select patients for METtargeted therapy. Despite the encouraging nature of
these data sets, limitations must be considered. Namely
both Phase II studies had a small sample sizes and did
not prospectively stratify based on MET expression
status (definition of MET positivity was determined
before unblinding but after random assignment). Several
outstanding questions remain with respect to the use of
MET IHC. Rigorous clinical validation of the diagnostic
cut-off point used to define MET positivity will be critical
given the detrimental outcomes seen in the Phase II setting
in MET-negative patient subsets [47, 48, 62]. Proper
selection and validation of cut points for both the extent
and intensity of MET staining will be critical. Phase II
data so far indicate that using a proportional cut-off of
>50% may provide the best discriminative power to select
MET-positive patients for treatment with onartuzumab
or rilotumumab. For both agents, application of either a
more stringent (e.g. 90%) or a less stringent (e.g. 10%)
diagnostic cut-off appeared inferior [47, 65]. Differences

exist with respect to the intensity of MET IHC staining
between different tumor types, which may prove important
when validating staining intensity cut-off values. For
example, MET staining in GEC cases appears generally
weaker and shows a more pronounced cytoplasmic
component compared to NSCLC specimens when scored
using the SP44 antibody (HK, personal observation) [66].
It is unclear if this variance between cancer types is driven
by differences in biology and/or pre-analytical variables
such as sample type and tissue processing/fixation [67].
As a consequence of differences seen in the nature and
spectrum of MET expression in gastric versus lung tumors,
Genentech are employing a broader definition of MET
positivity for patient selection in the pivotal onartuzumab
trial in GEC (MetGastric) trial compared to MetLung i.e.
MET IHC score ≥ 1+ (MetGastric) vs. ≥ 2+ (MetLung).

MET gene amplification and copy number
increase
Aberrations in gene copy number in malignant cells
can be driven by either gene amplification or polysomy.
Gene amplification refers to a copy number gain for a
specific gene (or group of genes) on a given chromosome

as well as systemic levels of HGF has been shown to be
elevated in GEC, often associated with poor prognosis
[24, 70-72]. It is conceivable that increased local levels
of HGF protein may be a relevant indicator of aberrant
MET pathway signaling activity not necessarily reflected
in systemic HGF levels. In epithelial-derived tumors,
HGF expression is primarily restricted to the stromal
cell population. However, in rare cases, tumor cells
can express HGF, leading to an autocrine loop-type
mechanism of activation of MET. In preclinical models,
autocrine expression of HGF correlates with active MET
signaling and can predict efficacy with MET-targeting
agents in the absence of exogenous human HGF [73].
Intratumoral co-expression of both HGF and MET mRNA,
possibly indicative of autocrine signaling, was associated
with reduced survival and an increased risk of peritoneal
dissemination in a cohort of Japanese patients with GEC
[24].
Although increased local levels of HGF could lead
to the enhanced activation of the MET signaling pathway,
these data should be cautiously interpreted. Reagents to
evaluate intratumoral levels of HGF protein have not
been vigorously validated with respect to sensitivity
and specificity and it remains unclear how systemic
levels of HGF in the serum/plasma relate to HGF levels
and pathway activity in the tumor microenvironment. It
remains to be seen if HGF expression with gastric tumors
can be reliably measured and if it proves to be a clinically
useful biomarker to select patients for anti-MET therapy.

arm without a change in copy number for genes located in
other regions of the chromosome, whereas polysomy gives
rise to a copy number gain for a given gene as a result
of the presence of extra copies of the entire chromosome
[68]. In preclinical models, MET gene amplification
results in constitutive activation of the MET receptor and
an oncogenic addiction to the MET signaling pathway
thereby rendering gastric tumor cells acutely sensitive
to HGF/MET axis inhibition [40, 41]. While MET
amplification is relatively common in GEC cell lines
[40], it is has typically been observed in <5% of patient
tumor samples [29, 35-37, 69]. Although clinically rare,
MET amplification has been correlated with an increased
frequency of distant metastasis, more extensive TNM
stage and diminished survival in retrospective clinical
series [29, 35]. MET copy number gain has been reported
in up to 30% of clinical cases and may be associated with
poor prognosis [36, 37]. Preliminary clinical studies of
anti-MET therapy in patients with GEC appear to confirm
that MET amplification or high-level copy number gain
is rare and may not be predictive of clinical benefit [47,
51]. This is supported by a recent analysis by Koeppen et
al [65], in which MET copy number (cut-off ≥ 5 copies/
cell by FISH) was inferior to MET IHC staining as a
predictive marker of benefit from onartuzumab in patients
with NSCLC. Retrospective studies in GEC cases suggest
that MET copy number maybe positively correlated with
protein overexpression measured by IHC suggesting that
high gene copy number leads to high protein expression
in this subpopulation [29, 31]. Ultimately, the usefulness
of MET gene amplification as a predictive biomarker
as well as the concordance between amplification and
protein expression remain to be established in large-scale
randomized trials.

Outlook and future directions
The HGF/MET signaling axis appears to play
an important role in the development and malignant
progression of gastroesophageal cancers, particularly in
tumor invasiveness and metastasis. Monoclonal antibodies
targeting either HGF or the MET receptor are currently in
Phase III trials, the results of which will ultimately clarify

the role of MET inhibition in the GEC setting. The main
challenges facing the effective use of HGF/MET-targeted
agents for cancer treatment are optimal patient selection,
diagnostic and pharmacodynamic biomarker development,
the identification and testing of rational drug combinations
and further understanding of the toxicities associated with
pathway inhibition.
Defining the patient population most likely to benefit
from HGF/MET-targeted therapy is imperative. Multiple
biomarker platforms are currently being investigated for
this purpose in GEC, the most advanced being IHC. While
preliminary data from patient subsets in randomized Phase
II trials have shown that high MET protein expression
as measured by IHC can differentiate patients who may
benefit from MET pathway blockade, the success of MET
IHC as a predictive biomarker has not been universal in all
tumor types [48]. Susceptibility to pre-analytical variables
such as sample type, tissue fixation and processing and
the subjectivity of interpretation can be liabilities for
IHC. These considerations coupled with the detrimental
outcomes seen in patients with low levels of MET
expression treated with MET-targeted drugs will demand
stringent quality control with respect to the performance
and interpretation of IHC in GEC [47, 48, 62]. IHC assays
to determine HER2 status in GEC have been in clinical
practice as companion diagnostic assays for around three
years and have taught us about the benefits and challenges
of such an approach. Ongoing clinical studies will also
shed light on the usefulness of biomarker platforms other
than MET IHC, including HGF expression (IHC, in situ
hybridization and Real Time PCR), MET amplification
and blood-based markers.
Should anti-MET therapy prove to be clinically
effective, an understanding of the toxicity implications
of MET antagonism will be essential. To date HGF/
MET-targeted agents, in particular monoclonal antibodies
appear to be relatively well tolerated. Peripheral edema
has been associated with treatment with all monoclonal
antibodies targeting HGF or MET in combination with
various cytotoxic and targeted therapies across multiple
tumor types [46]. A recent trial of onartuzumab in triple
negative breast carcinoma reported peripheral edema in
~60% of patients randomized to receive onartuzumab
[74] The etiology of MET inhibitor-induced edema is
unclear, but may be attributable to an attenuation of
HGF-mediated signaling in the vascular endothelium.
In physiological conditions, HGF in the endothelium
helps to protect against VEGF-induced endothelial
hyper-permeability. Perturbation of HGF/MET signaling
could disrupt this balance resulting in endothelial
leak. Interestingly, an increased incidence of venous
thromboembolism has also been observed in the setting
of HGF/MET inhibition possibly supporting the notion
that anti-HGF/MET drugs can disrupt the functioning of
the vascular endothelium. Since HGF/MET signaling has
been implicated in physiological processes such as tissue
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

growth/repair, hematopoiesis and glucose metabolism;
it is possible that large-scale randomized trials of HGF/
MET inhibitors may unearth additional toxicity signals
such as myelosuppression, mucosal injury, wound healing
complications or disturbances in glucose homeostasis [7579].
The complexity and diversity of HGF/MET signal
transduction coupled with the high degree of interplay
between MET and other membrane receptors, as well as
its role in resistance suggest that combination treatment
approaches will be most fruitful.
In the context of GEC, combinability of HGF/METtargeted agents with chemotherapy will be imperative.
Both RILOMET-1 and MetGastric are utilizing different
platinum-based cytotoxic combinations (ECX vs.
mFOLFOX6) and it remains to be seen if the difference
in chemotherapy backbone will impact the outcome of the
respective trials. Preclinically, aberrant MET signaling
has been implicated in resistance to both cisplatin and
oxaliplatin [42, 80]. The clinical question of whether or not
the choice of platinum agent in the setting of HGF/MET
inhibition is important will be informed by the MEGA and
RILOMET-1 studies, which are combining HGF-targeted
therapy with mFOLFOX6 and ECX respectively.
A wealth of data indicates a high degree of coexpression and cross-talk with respect to MET and HER
family members, which include HER1/EGFR, HER2 and
HER3. Amplification or overexpression of HER2 occurs
in 10 – 15% of gastroesophageal adenocarcinomas and
HER2-targeted therapy (trastuzumab) is approved for use
in advanced GEC [7]. While HER2-directed treatment
has improved outcomes for eligible patients, additional
treatment options are still required in this setting. All
ongoing randomized trials of MET-directed treatments
are currently excluding those with HER2-positive disease,
primarily because of both differences in standard of care
and lack of data supporting the combinability of antiHER2 and anti-MET antibodies. Preclinical data could
support such combinations studies. In HER2 amplified
GEC cell lines, HGF-mediated MET activation is able to
rescue tumor cells from EGFR/HER2 inhibition, an effect
that could be abrogated by knockdown or pharmacologic
inhibition of MET [81]. While there appears to be minimal
overlap between HER2 and MET overexpression in
treatment naïve GEC [32], it is possible that compensatory
MET upregulation could occur during treatment with antiHER2 therapy resulting in resistance. This hypothesis
could be tested clinically through a trial combining a MET
inhibitor with an anti-HER2 agent.
Anti-angiogenic therapy is likely to become a
standard-of-care treatment for relapsed mGEC based on
results of a Phase III trial of ramucirumab, a VEGFR2targeted monoclonal antibody [82]. HGF/MET signaling
is a potent inducer of endothe­
lial cell growth and
promotes angiogenesis and lym­phangiogenesis in vitro
and in vivo and is though to be a key regulator of the
2874

Oncotarget

angiogenic switch [83]. HGF/MET and VEGF– VEGFR2
cooperate in inducing angiogenesis in vitro and in vivo
through activation of common signaling intermediates.
Collectively, these data could support combination trials of
HGF/MET-directed therapy with anti-angiogenic agents.
The results of ongoing trials of MET-targeted drugs with
anti-VEGF therapy in other tumor types will shed light on
the usefulness of this approach [46, 84].
Should HGF- or MET-directed therapy prove to
be an effective treatment option for patients with GEC,
experience with other RTK inhibitors suggests that
resistance will invariably develop even in the subset of
cancers that initially derive clinical benefit [85]. In vitro
mechanisms of resistance to MET-targeted agents include
mutation in the MET activation loop, compensatory
upregulation of HER kinase signaling as well as
amplification of MET and KRAS [85-87]. In the event
that MET inhibitors enter the clinic, rationally designed
combination trials will be needed in order to abrogate
resistance to anti-HGF/MET therapy and further improve
clinical outcomes.
It is presently unclear to what extent targeting MET
or HGF might impact the efficacy of HGF/MET axis
inhibition. The results of RILOMET-1 and MetGastric
will provide some clinical insight into this issue should
the results of the respective trials be divergent. Of interest,
a randomized trial of ficlatuzumab (a humanized antibody
against HGF; Aveo) in combination with an EGFR
inhibitor in NSCLC failed to show efficacy in patients with
high MET expression Mok et al [88]. However, subgroup
analysis suggested that clinical benefit was enhanced in
patients with either stromal HGF expression or low MET
expression. These results are in contrast with other Phase
II studies in which high tumor MET expression was
predictive of clinical benefit from HGF/MET-directed
antibodies and might suggest that receptor versus ligand
targeting could be important depending on the tumor type
and/or combination partner.
Although GEC is a global disease, it is not uniform.
There are marked differences in patient demographics,
treatment practices and treatment outcomes in GEC
patients in different countries and regions [89]. It is
not clear if such geographic heterogeneity extends to
biological differences. In the setting of anti-angiogenic
therapy, patients from Asia (primarily Japan and Korea)
represented 49% of the total patient population enrolled
in the AVAGAST trial and seemed to gain less from the
addition of bevacizumab than patients in the rest of the
world [17]. Conversely, in the REGARD study, Asian
patients represented only 8% of the study population [82].
Collectively, the outcome of these trials and the apparent
regional differences in outcome evoke multiple questions
about global disease heterogeneity and its importance in
targeted therapy drug development. It remains to be seen
if such geographic heterogeneity will extend to outcomes
with respect to HGF/MET-directed therapy. Of note, while
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

RILOMET-1 is not involving countries from the AsiaPacific region, MetGastric is randomizing both Asian
and non-Asian patients. Should the outcomes of these
respective pivotal trials be different, this could indicate
clinically relevant geographic heterogeneity with respect
to HGF/MET biology.

CONCLUSION
Targeting the HGF/Met axis has significant clinical
potential in GEC, which will hopefully be realized in the
context of well-conducted clinical trials, the development
and clinical validation of pathway biomarkers and rational
mechanism-based treatment combinations.
