RAP80 Acts Independently of BRCA1 in Repair of
Topoisomerase II Poison-Induced DNA Damage
Junko Iijima1, Zhihong Zeng2, Shunichi Takeda1, and Yoshihito Taniguchi1

Abstract
The tumor suppressor BRCA1 functions in DNA homologous recombination, and mutations in BRCA1
increase the risk of breast and ovarian cancers. RAP80 is a component of BRCA1-containing complexes that
is required for recruitment of BRCA1 to sites of DNA damage. To evaluate the role of RAP80 in DNA damage
repair, we genetically disrupted both RAP80 alleles in the recombinogenic avian DT40 cell line. The resulting
RAP80−/− cells were proficient at homologous recombination and nonhomologous end-joining (NHEJ), but were
specifically sensitized to the topoisomerase II inhibitor etoposide. Notably, doubly mutant RAP80−/−BRCA1−/−
cells were more sensitive to etoposide than were BRCA1−/− cells, revealing that RAP80 performs a BRCA1independent repair function. Moreover, jointly impairing the function of CtIP, a distinct BRCA1 effector protein,
rendered RAP80−/− cells more sensitive to etoposide compared with singly mutant cells, again illustrating a
BRCA1-independent role of RAP80. Based on our findings, we propose that RAP80 exerts a specific function
in repair of the topoisomerase-cleavage complex, such as the removal of covalently bound polypeptides from
double-strand break ends independently of BRCA1. Cancer Res; 70(21); 8467–74. ©2010 AACR.

Introduction
Antimalignant therapy such as radiotherapy and treatment with inhibitors against topoisomerase I and II (Top1
and Top2) kills cycling cells by inducing double-strand
breaks (DSB; ref. 1). DSBs are repaired by two major pathways: homologous recombination and nonhomologous endjoining (NHEJ; ref. 2). Homologous recombination repairs
DSBs by using the intact homologous sequence as a template, and is initiated by a process called resection, which
generates single-strand tails at DSBs. This initial resection
is promoted by the Mre11/RAD50/NBS1 complex and CtIP
(3–5). Subsequently, Rad51 assembles with the single-strand
DNA with the help of Rad51 mediators such as BRCA1 and
BRCA2 (6, 7). NHEJ does not involve the resection step and is
initiated by the assembly of Ku70/Ku80 at DSBs (8).
Top1 and Top2 induce transient DNA breaks in distinctly
different manners. Top1 creates single-strand breaks and
binds to the 3′ end of DNA, whereas Top2 creates DSBs and
binds to the 5′ ends of DNA (1). Topoisomerase inhibitors
are divided into two categories: the topoisomerase poisons
and the topoisomerase catalytic inhibitors (9, 10). Top2 poiAuthors' Affiliations: 1 Department of Radiation Genetics, Kyoto

sons such as etoposide stabilize the covalent bond between
a tyrosine of Top2 and the 5′ ends of DSBs (the Top2-cleavage
complex), whereas Top2 catalytic inhibitors such as ICRF-193
prevent Top2 enzymatic activity without generating noticeable DNA damage. It is only after the long-term exposure of
catalytic inhibitors that they induce DNA damage responses
(9). The Top1 poisons such as camptothecin stabilize the
covalent bond between a tyrosine of Top1 and the 3′ ends of
single-strand breaks (the Top1-cleavage complex), which are
subsequently converted into DSBs during replication (10).
The choice of repair mechanisms is dependent on the type
of topoisomerase inhibitors used to induce the DNA damage.
ICRF-193–induced DNA damage is repaired exclusively by
NHEJ (11), whereas DSBs induced by etoposide are repaired
mainly by NHEJ, with a minor fraction repaired by homologous
recombination (11–13). In contrast, camptothecin-induced
DSBs are repaired primarily by homologous recombination
(14). Topoisomerase poison–induced DSBs, but not catalytic
inhibitor–induced DSBs, require an additional step prior to
NHEJ or homologous recombination, that is, the elimination
of the topoisomerase bound covalently to the DNA ends (Supplementary Fig. S1). This step is carried out by tyrosyl-DNAphosphodiesterases 1 and 2 (Tdp1 and Tdp2), as well as by the
CtIP nuclease. Tdp1 and Tdp2 resolve tyrosyl-DNA covalent
bonds that are formed on the 3′- and 5′-side of the DNA ends,
respectively (15, 16). CtIP, on the other hand, liberates the covalently bound polypeptides together with the oligonucleotides by making an incision near the cleavage complex (17,
18). CtIP has two functions: the removal of polypeptides from
DSBs and the resection of DSBs. Only the former function requires the physical interaction of CtIP with BRCA1 through
the phosphorylation of Ser332 in chicken CtIP (corresponding
to Ser327 in human CtIP; refs. 6, 19).

RAP80 was characterized as a component in RAP80Abraxas-BRCA1 (the A complex) and RAP80-CtIP-BRCA1
(the C complex), two of the three multiprotein complexes
containing BRCA1 (20–23). RAP80 promotes the recruitment
of BRCA1 to DNA-damage sites by physically interacting with
ubiquitylated proteins at DSBs through two ubiquitininteracting motifs (UIM) at the NH2-terminal portion of
RAP80. RAP80 is also known to form a complex with the
BRCC36 de-ubiquitinating enzyme, and to antagonize
RNF8-UBC13–mediated ubiquitination at DSBs (24). However, due to the absence of RAP80-disrupted cells, the role
of RAP80 and the BRCA1 subcomplexes that contain
RAP80 in the DNA-damage response remains undefined.
To analyze the role of RAP80, we disrupted RAP80 in chicken DT40 cells. Remarkably, RAP80−/− cells were proficient at
homologous recombination and NHEJ, and exhibited a
marked increase in sensitivity to the Top2 poison etoposide,
whereas the sensitivity of RAP80−/− cells to other DNA damaging agents was at near-normal level. This was in marked
contrast with BRCA1−/− cells, which exhibit a defect in homologous recombination and are accordingly hypersensitive to a
variety of damaging agents such as γ-rays and cisplatin. To
assess the functional interaction between RAP80 and BRCA1,
we generated RAP80−/−BRCA1−/− and RAP80−/−CtIPS332A/−/−
clones (CtIPS332A abolishes physical interaction between CtIP
and BRCA1). The two mutants displayed a more pronounced
hypersensitivity to the topoisomerase poisons than did the
relevant single-gene-disrupted clones. We therefore conclude
that RAP80 works independently of BRCA1 and CtIP in the
repair of DNA damage caused by the Top2-cleavage complex.

For the 3′ arm of the targeting construct, a 2.3-kb fragment
was amplified by PCR using the primers 5′-CTCTACTTCTGATGATGAACCAACCACGAG-3′ and 5′-ACTCATCATTAACAT‐AAAATACCAACAGCTCCTCC-3′, and was digested
with SacI. The resulting 1.4-kb fragment was cloned into
the SacI site of the pCR2.1 vector containing the 3.2-kb
5′ arm. The BamHI site was used to integrate the marker
gene cassettes.
Generation of RAP80-deficient clones
To generate RAP80-deficient cells, the linearized targeting
constructs RAP80-bsr and RAP80-hyg were sequentially

Materials and Methods
Cell culture and counting
DT40 cells were cultured at 39.5°C in RPMI-1640 medium
supplemented with 50 μmol/L β-mercaptoethanol, 10% FCS,
and 1% chicken serum (Sigma-Aldrich). They have been
maintained by S. Takeda since 1991 (25), and were tested
routinely for various criteria such as morphology, growth
rate, and karyotype. The cell numbers were determined as
described previously (26). Briefly, the cultured cells were
stained with propidium iodide (PI) and mixed with the fixed
number of polystyrene microspheres (Polysciences, Germany). The mixture was subjected to fluorescence-activated
cell sorter (FACS) analysis (FACSCalibur, Becton, Dickinson
and Company), in which the ratio of gated PI-negative cells
to the microspheres was determined and used for calculation
of the total cell number in the culture.
Construction of RAP80 targeting vector
Two RAP80 disruption constructs, RAP80-hyg and RAP80bsr, were generated from genomic PCR products of DT40
cells combined with hyg- and bsr-selection marker cassettes. Genomic DNA sequences were amplified using the
primers 5′-ATGGCGAGTTTGGTGTGCTTGTAAATCACG-3′
and 5′-GTGCCATGGCCTTAGGCCTCTATTAAAAAC-3′ for
the 3.2-kb 5′ arm of the targeting construct. Amplified
PCR products were cloned into pCR2.1 vector (Invitrogen).

transfected into DT40 cells by electroporation (Gene Pulser,
BioRad). The genomic DNA of the transfectants derived
from each colony was digested with EcoRV and BamHI,
and the targeted clones were confirmed by Southern blot
analysis. The probe for Southern blot was obtained by digestion of the 2.3-kb fragment described above with EcoRV
and XhoI. The 0.88-kb fragment that does not overlap with
the 3′ arm was used as a probe. The lack of RAP80 expression was confirmed by reverse transcriptase-PCR (RT-PCR)
using the primers 5′-AGTTCGGTAACCCAAT‐TGTGCCC-3′
and 5′-ATCTCCACCAGCCTGCATAGG-3′.
Generation of RAP80−/−BRCA1−/− and
RAP80−/−CtIPS332A−/− clones
Gene disruption of BRCA1 was carried out as described previously (27). RAP80−/− cells were transfected with BRCA1 targeting vectors (kind gifts from Douglas Bishop, University of
Chicago, Chicago, IL) that eliminate exon 3 through exon 11
of chicken BRCA1 gene including the translation start site.
The transfected cells were selected against puromycin or histidinol. The BRCA1-disrupted RAP80−/− cells were identified by
Southern blot analysis. The CtIPS332A−/− cells were transfected
with RAP80 targeting vectors as described previously (6).
Measurement of cellular sensitivity to
DNA-damaging agents
Methylcellulose colony formation and liquid-culture cell
survival assays were performed as described previously (28, 29).
In the latter assay, we measured the amount of ATP in the cellu-

lar lysates to determine the number of live cells. Cells (1 × 104)
were treated with each DNA-damaging agent in 1 mL medium
using 24-well plates and incubated at 39.5°C for 48 hours. We
transferred 100 μL of medium containing the cells to 96-well
plates and measured the amount of ATP using CellTiter-Glo
(Promega), according to the manufacturer's instructions. Luminescence was measured by Fluoroskan Ascent FL (Thermo
Fisher Scientific Inc.).
Immunofluorescent visualization of subnuclear
foci formation
To visualize Rad51 accumulation at DNA-damage sites in
DT40 cells, DSBs were induced in a subnuclear area using
137
Cs (Gammacell 40, Nordion), then stained with Rad51 antibodies as described previously (30).
Targeted integration frequencies
The gene targeting frequencies at Ovalbumin and CENP-H
loci were determined by Southern blot analysis of G418resistant colonies as described previously (6).
Plasmid-based NHEJ assay
Cells (1.5×106) were transfected with 2 μg of linearized
pmaxGFP vector and 2 μg of circular DsRed expression vector
using Nucleofector I (Amaxa Biosystems; ref. 31). Twenty-four
hours after transfection, expression of green fluorescent protein
(GFP) was analyzed using FACSCalibur (Becton, Dickinson and
Company). Data were corrected for transfection efficiency as
measured by the percentage of cells that express DsRed.

Results
RAP80-deficient DT40 cells grow at a normal rate
We first isolated RAP80 cDNA from chicken DT40 cells
based on the information in the chicken genome database.
The predicted chicken RAP80 protein shared 42.1% identity
with its human counterpart, with a total of 668 amino acids
in length (data not shown). The most conserved are the two
UIMs at the NH2 terminus, with 91.3% identity between the
two species. The chicken RAP80 gene spans 31.7 kb on the
genome and consists of 10 exons. We generated gene-targeting
constructs so as to delete the two UIMs, which were encoded
by exons 4 and 5 (Fig. 1A). Disruption of the two allelic RAP80
genes was confirmed by Southern blot analysis (Fig. 1B) and by
RT-PCR (Fig. 1C). The RAP80−/− cells proliferated with normal
kinetics (Fig. 1D).

RAP80−/− cells are hypersensitive to etoposide
To evaluate the role of RAP80 in the DNA-damage response, we analyzed the sensitivity of RAP80−/− cells to various DNA-damaging agents using a colony-formation assay.
Remarkably, the RAP80−/− cells did not display an increased
sensitivity to γ-ray, cisplatin (DNA cross-linker), UV, or H2O2
(Supplementary Fig. S2, data not shown), and showed only a
marginal increase in sensitivity to camptothecin compared
with wild-type cells (Fig. 2A). This phenotype is in marked
contrast with that of the BRCA1−/− cells, which showed the
hypersensitivity to all these agents. On the other hand, the
RAP80−/− cells showed a significant increase in sensitivity
to etoposide, the Top2 poison (Fig. 2B). To further investigate
the role of RAP80 in the tolerance of Top2 inhibitors, we tested
for the sensitivity to ICRF-193, another type of Top2 inhibitor,
which does not involve persistent Top2-cleavage complex formation. The sensitivity of the RAP80−/− cells to ICRF-193 was
comparable with that of wild-type cells (Fig. 2C). To confirm
the selective hypersensitivity of RAP80−/− cells to etoposide, we
measured the cellular survival at 48 hours after continuous exposure to etoposide using the liquid culture assay (29). The
RAP80−/− cells again showed an increased sensitivity to etoposide (Fig. 2D). In this assay, the BRCA1−/− cells, with a reduced
colony-formation frequency (Supplementary Fig. S3), exhibited a higher relative cellular tolerance to etoposide than
in the colony-survival assay. We conclude that RAP80 may
be required to repair DSBs when the Top2-cleavage complex
is involved.
No defect in homologous recombination or NHEJ in
RAP80-deficient cells
Previous reports indicate that depletion of RAP80 by siRNA
leads to radiosensitivity and reduces focus formation for
BRCA1 (20–23), which plays a key role in homologous recombination by promoting the accumulation of Rad51 at DNAdamage sites (27, 30, 32). We therefore tested whether
RAP80 promotes Rad51 focus formation at induced DSB sites
in chicken DT40 cells. In contrast to the greatly reduced
radiation-induced Rad51 focus formation in BRCA1−/− cells,
we found no reduction in Rad51 focus formation in RAP80−/−
cells after irradiation (Fig. 3). Next, we measured the gene
targeting frequency at the Ovalbumin and CENP-H loci

Role of RAP80 in Repair of Top2-Induced DNA Break

by Southern blot analysis. We found no decrease in genetargeting frequency in RAP80−/− cells compared with wildtype cells at these loci (Table 1). These results indicate
that RAP80 does not play an important role in homologous
recombination.
NHEJ is the pathway used to repair damage caused by
etoposide (11–13). Because RAP80−/− cells exhibited hypersensitivity to etoposide (Fig. 2B and D), we measured the efficiency of NHEJ in RAP80−/− cells by using a plasmid-based
DSB-repair assay, which monitors the NHEJ-mediated religation of DSBs in a transiently transfected GFP expression plasmid. Prior to transient transfection, the plasmid was cut
between the promoter and the GFP coding sequence by a restriction enzyme. If the linearized plasmids were correctly recircularized by NHEJ, the cells would express GFP (Fig. 4A).
Although KU70−/− cells showed a dramatic decrease in GFP
expression, RAP80−/− cells showed the rejoining activity comparable with wild-type cells (Fig. 4B). The GFP expression
was rather enhanced in BRCA1−/− cells, presumably due to
compensatory upregulation of NHEJ activity. To further
evaluate NHEJ in the RAP80−/− cells, we measured radiosensitivity in cells synchronized in the G1 to early S phase,
where NHEJ plays a dominant role in DSB repair (26). Cells
were separated by centrifugal elutriation with >80% of live
cell population found to be in the G1 phase (Supplementary Fig. S4). The G1-enriched RAP80−/− and wild-type cells
showed a similar sensitivity to γ-rays (Fig. 4C). Taken

together, we conclude that the deletion of RAP80 does
not compromise either the homologous recombination or
the NHEJ pathway.
RAP80 contributes to the damage response to Top2
poisons independently of BRCA1
Because previous reports indicate the functional interaction between RAP80 and BRCA1 (20–23), we generated
DT40 cells deficient in both RAP80 and BRCA1 genes (Supplementary Fig. S5A and B). The growth rate of the resulting
RAP80−/−BRCA1−/− cells was similar to that of the BRCA1−/−
cells (Supplementary Fig. S5C). To evaluate cellular sensitivity to etoposide, we measured the number of live cells after
48-hour continuous exposure to etoposide (6, 29). We took
these measures instead of performing a conventional colony
formation assay because plating efficiencies were different
among the mutant clones (Supplementary Fig. S3), and the
growth and the ability to form a colony from a single cell
in the semisolid methylcellulose medium were poor with
double mutant clones and BRCA1−/− cells. We found that
the sensitivity of RAP80−/−BRCA1−/− cells to camptothecin
and ICRF-193 was similar to the BRCA1−/− single-mutant cells
(Fig. 5A). On the other hand, the RAP80−/−BRCA1−/− cells
showed an increased sensitivity to etoposide when compared
with BRCA1−/− cells, suggesting that BRCA1 and RAP80 can
contribute to the repair of the Top2-cleavage complex
independently of each other.

survival of RAP80−/−CtIPS332A/−/− cells. In both cases, cell survival was assessed by measuring the number of live cells after 48-hour exposure to

BRCA1 promotes two different repair reactions: the CtIPmediated removal of the topoisomerase-cleavage complex
from DSBs, and RAD51 assembly at DNA-damage sites
(6, 27, 30, 32, 33). Although RAP80 is not involved in the latter
BRCA1 function, it is unclear whether it facilitates the CtIPmediated removal of the topoisomerase-cleavage complex.
To clarify this issue, we disrupted the RAP80 gene in CtIPS332A/−/−
cells. The S332A mutation abolishes the capability of CtIP to
interact with BRCA1 without compromising homologous recombination (6). CtIPS332A/−/− cells exhibited an increase in
sensitivity to both camptothecin and etoposide as reported
previously (Fig. 5B; ref. 6). Remarkably, RAP80−/−CtIPS332A/−/−
cells showed a greater sensitivity to etoposide and camptothecin than did either single mutant, suggesting that RAP80 acts
separately from the BRCA1/CtIP-dependent pathway. The
increase in sensitivity of RAP80−/−CtIPS332A/−/− cells to camptothecin compared with CtIPS332A/−/− cells could be due to
the shift in the equilibrium of the BRCA1 protein to a distinct
complex (for example BACH1-BRCA1 complex), which would
act in the homologous recombination repair of camptothecininduced DNA damage in the absence of RAP80. In summary,

8472

Cancer Res; 70(21) November 1, 2010

our results show that RAP80 plays a role in removing the
Top2-DNA cleavage complex from DNA ends independently
of BRCA1 and the BRCA1-CtIP complex.

Discussion
In this study, we present genetic evidence that RAP80 contributes to the repair of DNA damage induced by Top2
poison. RAP80-deleted cells showed hypersensitivity to etoposide and, to a marginal extent, camptothecin, but not to
ICRF-193, γ-rays, UV, or cisplatin. There are various mechanisms by which cells deal with DNA damage caused by
topoisomerase inhibitors (Supplementary Fig. S1). These mechanisms include (a) homologous recombination (14),
(b) NHEJ (11–13), (c) nuclease (the BRCA1/CtIP complexes;
refs. 6, 17, 18), and (d) Tdp enzymes, which cut the covalent
bond between the DNA and the polypeptides of the topoisomerase-cleavage complex (15, 16). The third and fourth mechanisms affect cellular tolerance to topoisomerase poisons by
eliminating polypeptides from the DNA ends for subsequent
homologous recombination– and NHEJ-dependent DSB

Role of RAP80 in Repair of Top2-Induced DNA Break

repair. We investigated which pathway RAP80 contributed to
the repair of etoposide-induced DNA damage using DT40 cell
lines. We found that RAP80−/− cells were proficient at homologous recombination and showed normal NHEJ. Furthermore,
although RAP80 was identified as a component of the BRCA1
complex, the absence of RAP80 significantly augmented
etoposide sensitivity in the BRCA1−/− and CtIPS332A/−/− clones,
indicating that RAP80 functions separately from the BRCA1/
CtIP-dependent damage response. These observations are in
concert with the previous report showing that RAP80 exists
in two distinct complexes, one of which is devoid of BRCA1
(34). That will leave us with the fourth possibility that RAP80
acts through Tdp2. Indeed, we did observe an epistatic relationship between RAP80 and Tdp2, which repairs Top2 damage by cleaving the phosphotyrosyl bond linking Top2 to DNA
5′-termini (Supplementary Fig. S6). RAP80 may thus act in
concert with Tdp2 to remove Top2 from 5′ ends of DSBs.
We are currently pursuing this possibility further.
Although our study clearly shows the BRCA1-independent
role of RAP80, it does not necessarily exclude the BRCA1dependent function for RAP80. We could not observe the
BRCA1-dependent function of RAP80, because RAP80deficient DT40 cells were not hypersensitive to γ-ray and
did not show discernible homologous recombination defects.
Several groups have reported that the human cells show hypersensitivity to ionizing radiation and reduced homologous
recombination capability (20–23). The discrepancy between
our results and previous studies may be due to the defective
damage checkpoint in DT40 cells (35), which could mask
the role of RAP80 in BRCA1-dependent damage-checkpoint

signaling (36, 37) or even may stimulate homologous recombination (38). Hence, although we show that RAP80 can play a
role in repairing the topoisomerase-cleavage complex independently of BRCA1, our study does not necessarily exclude
a BRCA1-dependent function for RAP80.
Although etoposide is an effective anticancer drug, treatment with etoposide is associated with the occurrence of
the secondary leukemia through the generation of translocations at chromosome 11q23 (39). Further studies on RAP80dependent DNA repair may contribute to our understanding
of chromosomal translocation and thus to the development
of better clinical treatments for this life-threatening disease.
