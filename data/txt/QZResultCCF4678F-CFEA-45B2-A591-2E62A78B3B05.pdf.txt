BACKGROUND: Sargramostim is a granulocyte-macrophage–colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF). Unlike
filgrastim and pegfilgrastim, which are granulocyte–colony-stimulating factors (G-CSFs), sargramostim activates a broader range of myeloid lineage-derived cells. Therefore, GM-CSF might reduce infection risk
more than the G-CSFs. This study compared real-world infection-related hospitalization rates and costs in
patients using G/GM-CSF for chemotherapy-induced neutropenia. METHODS: This retrospective matchedcohort study analyzed nationally representative health insurance claims in the United States from 2000
through 2007. The sample population included patients who received chemotherapy and G/GM-CSF.
G/GM-CSF treatment episodes began with the first administration of G/GM-CSF and ended when a subsequent administration was >28 days after a prior administration. Sargramostim patients were matched 1:1
with filgrastim and pegfilgrastim patients based on gender and birth year. Outcomes included infectionrelated hospitalization rates and the associated costs. Hospitalization rates were analyzed using univariate
and multivariate Poisson methods; covariates included myelosuppressive agents received, tumor type, anemia, and comorbidities. RESULTS: A total of 990 sargramostim-filgrastim and 982 sargramostim-pegfilgrastim matched pairs were analyzed. Cohorts were similar with regard to age, gender, and comorbid
conditions. Several differences were observed with regard to tumor type, anemia, and chemotherapy,
but no systematic trends were apparent. Sargramostim patients experienced a 56% lower risk of infectionrelated hospitalizations compared with filgrastim and pegfilgrastim patients. Infection-related hospitalization
costs were 84% and 62% lower for sargramostim patients compared with patients treated with filgrastim
and pegfilgrastim, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Among patients with or at risk for chemotherapy-induced
neutropenia, these data indicated that use of sargramostim was associated with a reduced risk
of infection-related hospitalization and lower associated costs compared with filgrastim or pegfilgrastim.

Chemotherapy-induced neutropenia is a principal side effect of myelosuppressive chemotherapeutic
agents.1 Chemotherapy-induced neutropenia increases
the risk of serious infections and can compromise the
effectiveness of chemotherapy by resulting in dose reductions or treatment delays, negatively affecting chemotherapy dose intensity. Although patients with a low risk of
complications can be treated in an outpatient setting, the
standard treatment of care for high-risk patients (ie, those
with fever and neutropenia) is immediate hospitalization
and empiric administration of broad-spectrum antibiotics.2,3 In the United States, the incidence rate of neutropenia hospitalization (including diagnoses for neutropenia,
infection, or fever) is estimated to be 34.2 cases per 1000
chemotherapy-treated patients, or approximately 60,000
cases per year.4 The incidence rate varies according to the
intensity of the chemotherapy regimen and the underlying
type of cancer. For example, the neutropenia hospitalization rates are lower for breast cancer patients receiving
chemotherapy than for leukemia or lymphoma patients.4
The cost and mortality rates associated with neutropenia
hospitalizations are substantial; estimates of the mean
cost range from approximately $19,000 to $27,000 per
hospitalization (adjusted for inflation to 2007 dollars);
estimates of inpatient mortality rates range from approximately 7% to 10%.4,5
Myeloid growth factors have become an important
part of supportive care to treat or prevent neutropenia in
cancer patients undergoing intensive chemotherapy. The
American Society of Clinical Oncology 2006 guidelines
recommend primary prophylactic use of colony-stimulating factor when the risk of febrile neutropenia is 20%
and suggest therapeutic use in patients with fever and neutropenia who are at high risk for infection-associated complications.6 In the United States, commercially available
myeloid growth factors include filgrastim and pegfilgrastim, which are granulocyte–colony-stimulating factors
(G-CSFs), and sargramostim, which is a granulocyte-macrophage–colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF). GM-CSF
differs from G-CSF in that, in addition to stimulating the
production of neutrophils, it also stimulates other myeloid
cells including monocyte/macrophages and dendritic cells,
potentially conferring broader immune-stimulatory properties. Thus, GM-CSF may offer additional protection
against infections compared with the G-CSFs. In fact,
GM-CSF is often used as an adjuvant in cancer vaccine
4840

studies owing to its ability to stimulate antigen-presenting
cells and induce an enhanced immune response.7-9
Although many placebo-controlled studies have
demonstrated that both G-CSF and GM-CSF are effective at reducing febrile neutropenia and infection complications in cancer patients receiving chemotherapy,10-13 to
our knowledge there are few studies published to date
comparing the efficacy, safety, and infection rates of GCSF versus GM-CSF in this setting. Two retrospective
studies reported that adverse events and/or febrile neutropenia occurred more frequently with sargramostim than
filgrastim.14,15 However, 2 randomized trials and a prospective medication-use evaluation study found that sargramostim and filgrastim have similar efficacy, safety, and
tolerability.16-18 To the best of our knowledge, no headto-head studies comparing the clinical outcomes of sargramostim versus pegfilgrastim in a chemotherapy-induced
neutropenia setting have been published to date. Similarly, there is limited published information on the comparative costs associated with the use of G-CSF versus
GM-CSF for chemotherapy-induced neutropenia.
We used a large health claims database to examine
the hypothesis that GM-CSF and G-CSFs are associated
with different rates of infection-related hospitalization
and the associated costs for patient care. In this retrospective study, based on real-world clinical practice data, we
found that GM-CSF administered in association with
myelosuppressive chemotherapy resulted in lower rates of
infection-related hospitalization and reduced costs compared with G-CSFs. These results provide a rationale for
incorporating sargramostim as part of the supportive care
for patients receiving chemotherapy with a significant risk
of inducing febrile neutropenia.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Data Source
Health insurance claims data from the Ingenix/IHCIS
Impact National Managed Care Database (Impact)
between January 2000 and December 2007 were used to
conduct the analysis. This large, nationally representative
database was designed to support benchmarking projects,
healthcare outcomes research, and other research initiatives. To create the Impact database, Ingenix compiles
claims data submitted by healthcare providers and
Cancer

Myeloid Growth Factors and Infection Risk/Heaney et al

pharmacies to approximately 45 health plans for reimbursement. Ingenix places significant emphasis on the
quality of the data and uses a series of data evaluation and
reconciliation steps to ensure the completeness, validity,
and consistency of the data. Ingenix also standardizes the
information across contributing health plans, which is
critical for creating valid benchmarks.
The Impact database includes complete medical and
pharmacy claims for more than 80 million managed care
lives, covering all census regions of the United States.
Data elements used in the present analysis included health
plan enrollment records, patient demographics, inpatient
and outpatient medical services, and outpatient prescription drug dispensing records. Finally, data included in the
Impact database are de-identified and are in compliance
with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 to preserve patient anonymity and
confidentiality.

Study Design
We conducted a retrospective matched-cohort analysis of
patients treated with sargramostim, filgrastim, and pegfilgrastim for chemotherapy-induced neutropenia. Included
in the study were patients who had 2 claims of sargramostim or filgrastim or 1 claim of pegfilgrastim (the
date of the first G/GM-CSF administration is referred to
as the index date); 1 cancer claim within 120 days before
the index date; and 1 chemotherapy claim within 60
days before the index date. The 120-day period before the
index date was defined as the baseline period. Patients
were further required to have no claims of G/GM-CSF
during the baseline period to study the incident use of
G/GM-CSF and to focus the analysis on G/GM-CSF
treatment episodes that were most likely to be associated
with the first chemotherapy cycle, because the incident
risk of febrile neutropenia is highest during that period.2
Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System (HCPCS)
codes were used to identify sargramostim (J2820), filgrastim (J1440 or J1441), and pegfilgrastim (J2505); International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical
Modification (ICD-9-CM) diagnosis codes were used to
identify cancer diagnoses (ICD-9-CM 140-208); and
Current Procedural Terminology (CPT), HCPCS, ICD9-CM procedural codes, and Revenue codes were used to
identify chemotherapy claims.

FIGURE 1. The study design scheme is shown. G/GM-CSF
indicates granulocyte/granulocyte-macrophage–colony-stimulating factor.

The treatment episode began with the first G/GMCSF service date and ended on the last claim date for
sargramostim and filgrastim episodes; pegfilgrastim
episodes ended on the last claim date plus a mean therapeutic duration of 19 days due to its long-acting nature.
The 19-day therapeutic duration reflected the average
number of days between 2 pegfilgrastim claims for those
patients with multiple pegfilgrastim claims in a treatment
episode. If a patient had claims that switched between
G/GM-CSF types, the switch was considered as marking
a separate treatment episode. A G/GM-CSF claim >28
days after a prior claim was considered to be a new treatment episode. This analysis only considered the first
treatment episode (Fig. 1).
Finally, patients had to be age 18 years as of the
index date and continuously enrolled in a health plan
throughout the 120-day period preceding the index date
to the episode end date. Sargramostim patients were
matched 1:1 with filgrastim and pegfilgrastim patients
based on gender and year of birth.
Outcome Measures
The main outcomes of the study included infectionrelated hospitalization rates and the associated costs per
patient per month. A patient was identified as having an
infection-related hospitalization if, during the treatment
episode, the patient had a hospitalization with an ICD-9CM diagnosis code for infectious and parasitic diseases
(ICD-9-CM 001.x-139.x). Febrile neutropenia-related
hospitalization, identified by the combined presence of
neutropenia (ICD-9-CM 288.0) and fever (ICD-9-CM
780.6), was an additional outcome considered in the analysis. However, febrile neutropenia-related hospitalization
was considered a secondary outcome due to the concern
that neutropenia and fever are likely undercoded in reimbursement claims.4 Infection-related and febrile neutropenia-related hospitalization rates were calculated as the
4841

Original Article

total number of infection-related hospitalizations (or febrile neutropenia-related hospitalizations) within a G/GMCSF cohort divided by that cohort’s patient-years of
observation.
The costs associated with an infection-related hospitalization included both inpatient facility costs and inpatient medical costs. Inpatient facility costs are the costs of
inpatient admissions to acute care and rehabilitation institutions and were included if the hospital admission date
occurred during the patient’s G/GM-CSF treatment episode. Inpatient medical costs are the costs associated with
the medical claims that occurred from the hospital admission date to the discharge date. Ingenix reports payerperspective cost data that have been adjusted for inflation,
based in part on the US Consumer Price Index, to reflect
2007 US dollars and that have been standardized across
health plans, data sources, and geographic areas to allow
for comparisons across patients.

Statistical Analysis
Univariate statistics were generated to compare the sargramostim-filgrastim and the sargramostim-pegfilgrastim
matched cohorts, respectively. The selected baseline
patient characteristics for comparison included age, gender, Charlson comorbidity index, comorbid conditions,
tumor types, history of anemia, and absolute neutrophil
counts (ANC). The Charlson comorbidity index is a score
of 17 comorbid diseases that are weighted for disease severity.19 A patient with a higher index value has a higher
risk of morbidity and mortality. Additional characteristics
included neutropenia diagnosis at index date and treatment patterns for chemotherapy and G/GM-CSF
administrations.
To quantify the frequency of infection-related (or
febrile neutropenia-related) hospitalizations, the incidence
rate was calculated as the number of relevant hospitalizations divided by the patient-years of observation in each
cohort. This person-time approach was used to account
for different lengths of observation periods among study
subjects in a nonexperimental naturalistic setting.
The infection-related and febrile neutropeniarelated hospitalization rates were then compared between
sargramostim and filgrastim and between sargramostim
and pegfilgrastim using univariate and multivariate incidence rate ratios. The univariate (crude or unadjusted)
4842

incidence rate ratio was calculated as the incidence rate in
the sargramostim group divided by that in the matched
filgrastim (or pegfilgrastim) group. Ninety-five percent
confidence intervals (95% CI) of incidence rate ratios
were computed based on the Poisson probability distribution. If a 95% CI includes the null value of 1, it indicates
that there is no statistically significant difference in the
infection- (or febrile neutropenia-) related hospitalization
rates between sargramostim and G-CSFs at a 2-sided a
error level of .05.
Multivariate Poisson regression analysis was further
performed to isolate the incremental effect of GM-CSF
over G-CSF on infection- (or febrile neutropenia-) related
hospitalization rates by adjusting for differences between
the groups. The covariates included the Charlson comorbidity index; the number of distinct chemotherapy agents
received; use of myelosuppressive agents (during the period 7 days before the index date to the end date); neutropenia at the index date; metastases; localized malignancy
(breast cancer, lung cancer, and non-Hodgkin lymphoma
[NHL]); and indicator variables for the presence of various comorbid conditions, including heart disease, renal
disease, liver disease, and history of anemia. The Poisson
regression model offsets differences in observation periods
across patients. Results are presented as adjusted incidence
rate ratios, and their 95% CIs were calculated using robust
standard errors for a matched design.
The costs associated with the primary endpoint,
infection-related hospitalizations, were based on the
standardized cost amounts paid by the insurers in the billing claims and were analyzed using univariate methods. A
2-part, multivariate regression model was also used to analyze costs but was found to yield unstable results because
of the relatively low number of infection-related hospitalizations observed in the sample. The different lengths of
patients’ treatment episodes were accounted for by
weighting costs by patients’ episode length. All statistical
analyses were performed using SAS statistical software
(version 9.1; SAS Institute Inc, Cary, NC).

RESULTS
Patient Characteristics
Sargramostim was found to be used relatively less frequently than filgrastim or pegfilgrastim in the context of
Cancer

Myeloid Growth Factors and Infection Risk/Heaney et al

chemotherapy-induced neutropenia; the use of filgrastim
and pegfilgrastim exceeded that of sargramostim roughly
by factors of 10 and 20, respectively. Thus, to compare
GM-CSF with G-CSFs in this clinical setting, a matchedcohort analysis was chosen. A total of 990 sargramostim
patients who met all of the selection criteria were matched
to 990 filgrastim patients and 982 pegfilgrastim patients
based on gender and year of birth (not all sargramostim
patients could be matched with pegfilgrastim patients).
The baseline characteristics by G/GM-CSF matched
cohort are summarized in Table 1. The sargramostim-filgrastim and sargramostim-pegfilgrastim matched cohorts
were similar with respect to age, gender, and comorbid
conditions. The sargramostim-filgrastim cohort also had
similar tumor types and history of anemia.
Analysis of baseline ANC values was limited by the
small number of patients with recorded values in the
claims database. There were 15, 20, and 32 sargramostim,
filgrastim, and pegfilgrastim patients, respectively, with
documented ANC values during the period 14 days
before or on the index date. With this limitation, ANC
values were not significantly different among the matched
cohorts, although pegfilgrastim patients had a higher
mean ANC value, possibly because pegfilgrastim is usually
given prophylactically, whereas sargramostim and filgrastim may be given for both treatment and prophylaxis.
The time between chemotherapy initiation and the
first pegfilgrastim administration was, on average, 20
days; whereas it was 28 days and 30 days for the first sargramostim and filgrastim administration, respectively.
Although it is not possible to identify accurately whether
G/GM-CSF was administered prophylactically, the observation that pegfilgrastim is administered a shorter time
after chemotherapy initiation is consistent with the notion
that pegfilgrastim tends to be used prophylactically more
often than sargramostim and filgrastim.
Among sargramostim patients, a smaller proportion
had breast cancer and NHL, and a greater proportion had
a history of anemia compared with pegfilgrastim patients.
Although several statistically significant differences were
observed with regard to the treatment episode characteristics, no systematic trends were apparent. Sargramostim
patients more frequently had neutropenia at index date
than both the filgrastim and pegfilgrastim cohorts analyzed in this study. The average number of chemotherapy
agents used and the proportion of patients receiving myeCancer

October 15, 2009

losuppressive agents were both higher in the sargramostim
cohorts than in the filgrastim cohort. The situation was
reversed when comparing sargramostim to pegfilgrastim
patients. The length of G/GM-CSF treatment was
approximately 31 days in the sargramostim and filgrastim
cohorts and approximately 58 days in the pegfilgrastim
cohort.

Infection-Related Hospitalization Rates
When outcomes were compared, the sargramostim group
had a lower risk of infection-related hospitalization compared with both filgrastim (univariate incidence rate ratio,
0.46; 95% CI, 0.22-0.97 [P ¼ .0422]) and pegfilgrastim
groups (univariate, 0.52; 95% CI, 0.17-1.98 [P ¼ .0628])
(Table 2). After controlling for confounding factors, multivariate results remained similar with adjusted incidence
rate ratios of 0.44 (95% CI, 0.20-0.97; P ¼ .0333) and
0.44 (95% CI, 0.21-0.90; P ¼ .0256) in the sargramostim
versus filgrastim and sargramostim versus pegfilgrastim
comparisons, respectively.

Febrile Neutropenia-Related
Hospitalization Rates
Febrile neutropenia-related hospitalizations were uncommonly recorded in billing claims. There were <10 such
events observed in each group (Table 2). Sargramostimtreated patients tended to have a lower febrile neutropeniarelated hospitalization rate than filgrastim or pegfilgrastim; the univariate and multivariate incidence rate ratios
were all less than 1, ranging from 0.58 to 0.85 (P >
.0500). However, the low statistical power precludes
conclusive analysis.

Infection-Related Hospitalization Costs
Infection-related hospitalization costs were on average 84%
($728) lower for sargramostim patients compared with filgrastim patients ($138/patient/month vs $866/patient/
month; P ¼ .0380) and 62% ($226) lower compared with
pegfilgrastim patients ($139/patient/month vs $365/
patient/month; P ¼ .0100) (Figure 2). On an annualized
basis, sargramostim is associated with cost reductions
of $8736/patient/year ($728  12) compared with filgrastim and $2712/patient/year ($226  12) compared with

DISCUSSION
Chemotherapy-induced neutropenia and infectionrelated complications are major causes of morbidity for
cancer patients undergoing myelosuppressive chemotherapy. Decreases in planned chemotherapy dose-intensity
have been associated with inferior outcomes.20,21 Febrile
neutropenia occurs with common chemotherapy regimens in 25% to 40% of treatment-naive patients and
incurs hospital stays, reduces patient quality of life, and
increases medical costs.22 The use of filgrastim and pegfilgrastim to treat and prevent chemotherapy-induced neutropenia is an established part of oncology supportive care
as at least 11 randomized controlled trials have demonstrated the benefits of filgrastim and pegfilgrastim.3,6,23,24
The use of GM-CSF to treat chemotherapy-induced neutropenia is somewhat less well-established, due to fewer
placebo-controlled randomized trials.10,12 Nonetheless,
GM-CSF has been shown to have efficacy in accelerating
neutrophil recovery in patients receiving induction chemotherapy for AML and in patients after autologous and
allogeneic bone marrow transplantation.25-27 This study
indicates that practitioners, in light of overlapping biologic actions on neutrophil recovery, use all of the myeloid
growth factors for similar indications.
Thus, the results of the current study provide new,
real-world information regarding the comparative outcomes of the GM-CSF sargramostim versus the G-CSFs
filgrastim and pegfilgrastim. Our primary aim was to
compare the efficacy of sargramostim versus filgrastim
and pegfilgrastim to reduce neutropenic complications,
specifically infection-related hospitalizations, and the attendant effects on cost. These outcomes are key factors for
oncologists and hematologists to consider in providing
optimal supportive care in a cost-constrained healthcare
environment.
We found that, although patients treated with sargramostim tended to have neutropenia diagnoses more often at treatment initiation, they experienced a 56% lower
risk of infection-related hospitalization than patients
treated with filgrastim or pegfilgrastim (adjusted P < .05
for both). Infection-related hospitalization costs exhibited

a similar trend, with sargramostim associated with 84%
and 62% lower inpatient costs compared with filgrastim
and pegfilgrastim, respectively.
The small number of reported cases of febrile neutropenia limited the ability to provide precise comparisons of myeloid growth factors in this respect. Whereas
sargramostim patients appeared to experience fewer febrile neutropenia-related hospitalizations compared with
filgrastim and pegfilgrastim, these results were not statistically significant. It is likely that cases of febrile neutropenia are generally underreported, because reimbursement
rules tend to result in nonuniform coding practices
regarding whether febrile neutropenia is coded as neutropenia, fever, both, or even infection.
A meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials
using G-CSF in the setting of chemotherapy-induced
neutropenia demonstrated a decreased mortality for the
treated patients, and no similar study is available for
sargramostim.23 Indeed, few randomized controlled trials examining sargramostim exist, and only a limited
number of comparative studies on filgrastim and sargramostim are available. To our knowledge, this is the first
study to directly compare clinical and economic outcomes of sargramostim and pegfilgrastim in the context
of chemotherapy-induced neutropenia in real-world
clinical settings. Previously published studies examining
sargramostim and filgrastim in chemotherapy-induced
neutropenia generally found that sargramostim and
4846

filgrastim had similar clinical efficacy in terms of hospital length of stay, neutropenic fever, or intravenous
antibiotic requirement.16-18 Our study results are concordant with this literature in that febrile neutropeniarelated hospitalization rates are similarly low between
GM- and G-CSFs. However, we detected a significantly
lower rate of infection-related hospitalization for sargramostim compared with filgrastim or pegfilgrastim. This
observation may reflect the broader immune stimulating
effects of GM-CSF, which may promote the immune
system to combat infections.
To our knowledge, there is limited research
regarding the comparative costs associated with the
use of G/GM-CSF for chemotherapy-induced neutropenia. Bennett et al reported a randomized trial that
compared resource utilization and costs associated with
filgrastim and sargramostim in a chemotherapy-induced
neutropenia setting and found that sargramostim
patients had lower resource use leading to a 17% cost
savings compared with filgrastim patients.28 Whalen et
al found that a formulary switch from filgrastim to sargramostim at a single US institution resulted in a 21%
cost savings for the institution.29 In contrast, our study
used a large claims database that included actual cost
data and reflected general clinical practice. Furthermore, although the 2 previous studies28,29 considered a
broader set of healthcare costs than our study, they are
consistent with our findings demonstrating lower
costs associated with sargramostim compared with the
G-CSFs in the context of chemotherapy-induced
neutropenia.
Because the observational design was susceptible to
various biases, we attempted to control for these potential
biases by carefully specifying the study design and selection criteria to ensure that the matched sargramostimfilgrastim and sargramostim-pegfilgrastim cohorts were
similar and conducted multivariate analysis to control for
potential confounding factors. However, such methodological measures only control for intercohort biases and
do not account for potential selection biases that might
arise from the population selection. Another potential
limitation is the use of claims data. Claims data are subject
to coding errors and different coding practices, frequently
do not include needed clinical factors (eg, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status, cancer stage,
neutrophil counts), and identify only services rendered

rather than services needed. This limitation likely
impacted the ability to properly identify febrile neutropenia-related hospitalizations, as evidenced by relatively low
frequencies observed in the data. However, because the
underascertainment of neutropenia-related hospitalizations is unlikely to be related to the type of G/GM-CSF
used, the comparisons made between these therapies
should be valid. Also, because claims data are based on
ICD-9-CM and CPT coding schemes, factors that may
distribute differentially among sargramostim, filgrastim,
and pegfilgrastim patients but that are either unavailable
in the codes or unobservable were not adjusted for in our
analysis. Moreover, because claims data do not provide information on institutions’ practices, any observed differences between G/GM-CSF could not be controlled for
potential heterogeneous practices across institutions.
Nonetheless, an advantage of using claims data is that it
permits identification of enough events, even those that
are highly selected, to have sufficient statistical power
for meaningful analysis. In addition, the data, derived
from patients treated from a broad range of clinical environments, including both academic and community
practices, reflect real-world patient management and
emphasize therapies that are actually administered in a
way that intention to treat analyses do not capture.

Conclusions
We believe the current study is the first to compare infection-related hospitalizations and costs of chemotherapyinduced neutropenia patients treated with sargramostim,
filgrastim, and pegfilgrastim in a real-world setting.
Chemotherapy-induced neutropenia patients treated
with sargramostim experienced significantly lower risks
of infection-related hospitalizations, which translated
into lower associated costs compared with patients
treated with filgrastim and pegfilgrastim. These results
suggest that GM-CSF may have clinical and economic
advantages over G-CSFs with respect to infectionspecific endpoints.
