Abstract
Excess production of the proinﬂammatory IL6 has both local
and systemic tumor-promoting activity in many cancers, including ovarian cancer. However, treatment of advanced ovarian
cancer patients with a neutralizing IL6 antibody yielded little
efﬁcacy in a previous phase II clinical trial. Here, we report results
that may explain this outcome, based on the ﬁnding that neutralizing antibodies to IL6 and STAT3 inhibition are sufﬁcient to
upregulate the EGFR pathway in high-grade serous and other
ovarian cancer cells. Cell treatment with the EGFR inhibitor
geﬁtinib abolished upregulation of the EGFR pathway. Combining neutralizing IL6 antibodies and geﬁtinib inhibited malignant

cell growth in 2D and 3D culture. We found that ErbB-1 was
localized predominantly in the nucleus of ovarian cancer cells
examined, contrasting with plasma membrane localization in lung
cancer cells. Treatment with anti-IL6, geﬁtinib, or their combination all led to partial restoration of ErbB-1 on the plasma membrane. In vivo experiments conﬁrmed the effects of IL6 inhibition
on the EGFR pathway and the enhanced activity of a combination
of anti-IL6 antibodies and geﬁtinib on malignant cell growth.
Taken together, our results offer a preclinical rationale to combine
anti-IL6 and geﬁtinib to treat patients with advanced stage ovarian
cancer. Cancer Res; 75(7); 1255–64. 2015 AACR.

Introduction

In mouse models, anti-IL6 antibodies have antitumor activity,
inhibiting communication between malignant cells and stroma,
reducing the leukocyte inﬁltrate and angiogenesis, with evidence
of vessel normalization (3). We reported some activity in a phase
II clinical trial of an anti-IL6 antibody in patients with advanced
HGSC, but sustained responses were not achieved (3). One of the
17 HGSC patients treated had a partial response to anti-IL6
therapy, 7 others had periods of disease stabilization, and systemic levels of some cytokines, inﬂammatory, and tumor biomarkers were reduced during the therapy but rose as the patients
regressed.
There could be many reasons for the low efﬁcacy of IL6
blockade in patients with HGSC. Our previous research would
suggest that a major factor might be the complexity of malignant cell cytokine production. As we have shown that inﬂammatory cytokines such as IL6 interact in networks with other
inﬂammatory mediators and growth factors in ovarian cancer
cells (4, 7, 8), we hypothesized that inhibiting constitutive
IL6 production by malignant cells may induce reciprocal
feedback regulation in other signaling pathways that compensates for their action and reduces efﬁcacy of neutralizing
anti-IL6 antibodies.
To investigate this hypothesis, we treated ovarian cancer cells
with neutralizing anti-IL6 antibodies and studied changes in
intracellular signaling pathways. We found that inhibiting IL6
signaling in these cells and ovarian cancer xenografts upregulated
EGFR signaling and ERK activation. A combination of EGFR
inhibition by geﬁtinib and neutralizing anti-IL6 antibodies had
enhanced anticancer activity.

Abnormal regulation of IL6 and its major downstream transcription factor STAT3 is a feature of many human cancers (1).
Constitutive production of IL6 and STAT3 occurs downstream of
some oncogenic mutations in malignant cells and there is strong
evidence that IL6 is tumor promoting in many different experimental cancer models (2).
IL6 is implicated in the pathophysiology of high-grade
serous ovarian cancer (HGSC) and clear cell ovarian cancer
(3–5). We previously demonstrated that constitutive IL6 production by malignant cells is a major regulator of cancer-related
inﬂammation and cytokine networks in HGSC, having important local and systemic tumor-promoting actions (3, 4, 6).

Materials and Methods
Ovarian cancer cell lines
The IGROV-1 line was recently characterized as a hypermutated
line but does have TP53 and BRCA2 mutations typical of HGSC
(9). The AOCS1 cell line was established from a patient diagnosed
with HGSC, Silverberg grade 3, with <1cm residual disease after
primary surgery. The patient had 18 months progression-free
survival after six cycles carboplatin and paclitaxel adjuvant chemotherapy but showed no response to Line 2 liposomal doxorubicin. The cell line AOCS1 was established from material taken
at second relapse. AOCS1 stains with antibodies to EPCAM and
Pax8. The G33 cell line was established in our laboratory from
omental metastases of a patient with HGSC after chemotherapy.
It has a p53 mutation W146 and is positive for EPCAM and
Pax8. Quality control of all cell lines was carried out by frequent
STR analysis (Euroﬁns MWG), mycoplasma testing (InvivoGen)
and cell lines were used for 4 to 5 passages before new cells
were recovered from frozen master stocks. Cells were cultured in
RPMI-1640 supplemented with 10% FCS and 1% penicillin/
streptomycin. Cells were counted using a Vi-cell cell counter
(Beckman Coulter) on days 3 and 7. All technical and experimental replicates were repeated in triplicate.
Primary cancer cells
All the tissue samples were obtained under the guidelines of the
Human Tissue Authority Act 2004, and all patients had given prior
consent under the Research Ethical Committee Project reference
10/H0304/14.
Treatments
Cells were treated with 10 mg/mL anti-IL6 antibody (MEDI5117;
Medimmune), and 1 mmol/L geﬁtinib (AstraZeneca AZD1839).
MEDI5117 is a human IgG1k monoclonal antibody that
binds to IL6 with sub-pM afﬁnity and neutralizes it by preventing the binding to IL6R. MEDI5117 was generated using
phage display technology. It bears a triple mutation (referred
to as YTE) in the Fc domain of the heavy chain that extends its
stability in circulation. MEDI5117 is active in several preclinical cancer models, including non–small cell lung cancer,
prostate cancer, breast cancer, and ovarian cancer xenografts
in mice (Manuscript in preparation, Medimmune). An IgG1
isotype control antibody was generated by MedImmune
and was used at the same concentration as anti-IL6 antibody
(10 mg/mL).
Protein extraction from mouse tumors
Of note, 75 mg of tumor tissue was lysed with 1 mL of icecold lysis buffer (150 mmol/L NaCl 20mmol/L Tris, pH 7.5,
1 mmol/L EDTA 1 mmol/L EGTA 1% Triton X-100) with
protease and phosphatase inhibitors. Samples were then dissociated using gentleMACS Dissociator. After dissociation,
samples were centrifuged at 1,500 rpm for 2 minutes. Samples
were always kept on ice between procedures. Next, using a
probe sonicator set at 40% amplitude, tissues were sonicated
for 5 to 15 seconds bursts. Sonicated samples were then
rotated for 30 minutes at 4 C followed by a centrifugation
for 15 minutes at 13,200 rpm at 4C. The pellet was discarded
and protein concentration measured. Lysates were frozen at
80 C until loaded on gels.

Western blotting
Cells were washed with PBS and harvested using RIPA Buffer
(R0278, Sigma) with 1 proteinase inhibitors. Protein quantiﬁcation was performed using the Bradford reagent (Sigma-Aldrich),
according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cell extracts (25 mg)
were run on a NuPAGE Novex 4% to 12% Bis-Tris Gel, 1.5 mm
and transferred to a nylon membrane. The membrane was
blocked overnight (4 C in PBS with 0.1% Tween and 5% milk
powder) and probed using the following antibodies: PhosphoStat3 (Tyr705; 1:1,000 #9145, Cell Signaling Technology), Stat3
(1:1,000 #4904, Cell Signaling Technology), p-ERK (1:1,000
sc-7383, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), ERK (1:1,000 #9102, Cell
Signaling Technology), phospho-ErbB-1 (1:1,000 #2220, Cell
Signaling Technology), ErbB-1 (1:1,000 2232, Cell Signaling
Technology), phospho-ErbB-4 (1:500 #3790, Cell Signaling Technology), ERbB-4 (1:1,000 #4795, Cell Signaling Technology),
TNFa (1:1,000 ab6671, Abcam), Jagged1 (1:1,000 SC-8303,
Santa Cruz Biotechnology), a-tubulin (1:2,000 sc-8035, Santa
Cruz Biotechnology), lamin A/C (1:2,000 #2032, Cell Signaling
Technology), b-actin (1:5,000 A5316, Sigma). A rabbit or mouse
horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (GE
Healthcare) incubation allowed visualization using enhanced
chemiluminescence (ECL; GE Healthcare). Protein concentration
equivalence was conﬁrmed by anti–b-actin antibody.
Quantifying Western blot analyses
Western blot analyses were quantiﬁed using ImageJ analysis.
The images were set to grayscale 8-type bit and a rectangular box
was drawn to enclose a single lane. The box was then selected as
the ﬁrst lane and the same process was repeated for the remaining
of the lanes. The relative density of the contents of each lane was
then plotted as histograms and a straight line was drawn underneath where the peak ends to subtract any background. The wand
tool was then used to get the measurements of each proﬁle. The
ratios were obtained by normalizing the density of each band to
its total protein or loading control (10).
Immunoprecipitation
A total of 2  107 cells were homogenized in 1 mL of RIPA
buffer (R0278, Sigma) containing phosphate inhibitor cocktail
(P-5726, Sigma) and incubated on ice for 10 minutes. Samples
were centrifuged at 10,000 g for 10 minutes at 4 C, and supernatant was then transferred to a new tube. Protein concentration
of the supernatant was determined. Lysates were cleaned using
Rabbit IgG control and 20 mL of Protein A/G PLUS-Agarose beads
(sc-2003; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 30 minutes at 4 C. Beads
were pelleted by centrifugation at 2,500 rpm for 5 minutes and
lysates transferred to a clean tube. Samples were immunoprecipitated for 2 hours at 4 C using 500 mg of total lysate and 2 mg of
appropriate antibody (ErbB-1 or STAT3). Lysates were then rotated overnight at 4 C with 20 mL of A/G PLUS Agarose beads. The
next day, the Agarose beads were washed four times in RIPA buffer
followed by a 5 minute centrifugation at 1,000g at 4 C. After
ﬁnal wash, supernatant was discarded and pellet was resuspended
in 40 mL of 1 electrophoresis buffer, boiled for 5 minutes at 70 C
before separation using SDS-PAGE.
Immunoﬂuorescence staining and nuclear quantiﬁcation
A total of 1  104 cells were plated on coverslips (Nalge Nunc
International, ThermoFisher Scientiﬁc) and kept in culture with

RPMI-1640 medium supplemented with 10%FCS and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. Next day, medium was replaced with serumfree medium. Cells were treated with 10 mg/mL of anti-IL6
antibody and/or 1 mmol/L geﬁtinib and incubated at 37 C, 5%
CO2 for 24 hours. Supernatants were discarded and cells were
ﬁxed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 30 minutes, permeabilized
in 0.5% Triton X-100 for 30 minutes, and washed three times in
0.1% Triton X-100. Staining was performed overnight with ErbB-1
(1:50 Alexa Fluor 488, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or isotype
control (1:200, R&D systems). Primary antibody was washed
with PBS. Slides were counterstained with DAPI Prolong Gold
(Invitrogen) and images captured by Nikon Eclipse 80i microscope and Image-Pro Plus software (Media Cybernetics).
Nuclear and cytoplasmic quantiﬁcation of ErbB-1 immunoﬂuorescent data was done using MetaMorph Microscopy Automation & Image Analysis Software following the instructions provided by the manufacturer.

Results
IL6 inhibition activates EGFR signaling in ovarian cancer cells
We initially tested the effect of neutralizing antibodies to IL6 on
newly established high-grade serous ovarian cancer cell lines
(AOCS1, G33), on freshly isolated cells from HGSC ascites and
on IGROV-1, a previously characterized IL6 producing ovarian
cancer line of uncertain histotype but with TP53 and BRCA2
mutations (9). We ﬁrst asked whether treating cells with a neutralizing antibody to IL6 had an impact on other intracellular
signaling pathways that were likely to be active in these cells, with
a focus on ErbB signaling. Cells were cultured for 3 and 7 days in
the presence of an anti-IL6 antibody (MEDI5117) or an IgG
isotype control (Fig. 1A, for AOCS1 and primary cells; Supplementary Fig. S1A for IGROV-1 cells).
Western blot analysis and quantiﬁcation showed, as expected,
that inhibition of IL6 reduced STAT3 phosphorylation (Supplementary Fig. S1A–S1C,). However, in the presence of IL6 inhibition, the cells activated alternative signaling pathways through

siRNA transfection
A total of 2  104 cells were plated in a 6-well plate and
transfected with 100 pmol of siRNA pool of four different targeting sequences or nonspeciﬁc scramble control (stock concentration at 50 pmol/mL) in 250 mL serum-free medium. Of note, 4 mL
of lipofectamine 2000 (Life technologies) was also added to the
mix. Samples were vortexed and incubated at room temperature
for 15 minutes. After 6 to 8 hours, medium was removed and
replaced with fresh RPMI-1640 supplemented with 10% FCS.
Twenty-four hours later, protein quantiﬁcation was accessed and
20 mg of cell lysate was analyzed by Western blot analysis.
IHC
Parafﬁn-embedded sections of tumors collected from mouse
xenograft were stained with antibodies for Phospho-p44/42
MAPK (Erk1/2; Thr202/Tyr204; Cell Signaling Technology,
9106S), Tyr705 phospho-STAT3 (Cell Signaling Technology,
9145), and Y1068 phospho-EGFR (Cell Signaling Technology,
8543S). Slides were counterstained with hematoxylin. Negative
controls were isotype matched. The conditions used for staining
with individual antibodies were in accord with the manufacturers'
recommendations.
Growth of tumors in mice and bioluminescence imaging
A total of 10  106 luciferase-expressing IGROV-1 cells
(IGROV-1luc) were injected intraperitoneally (i.p.) into 20 g
6- to 8-week-old female BALB/c nu/nu mice (purchased from
Charles River, UK Ltd). These cell lines were generated as
previously published (11). Mice were observed daily for tumor
growth and killed once they reached end points as deﬁned in
our Home Ofﬁce Project Licence PPL 70/7411 (20% increase
in abdominal distension). All observable peritoneal tumors
were dissected and weighed at the end of the experiment. There
were 8 mice in each group and two separate experiments were
conducted.
Statistical analysis
Statistical analyses were carried out using Prism GraphPad
software. Statistical signiﬁcance was calculated using ANOVA and
the Student t test. Findings are presented as SEM.

ErbB-1, ErbB-4, and ERK phosphorylation (Fig. 1A and Supplementary Fig. S1). The results in Fig. 1 and Supplementary Fig. S1
were consistent in repeated experiments. To demonstrate this, we
show mean results of the key ﬁnding from three experiments with
the AOCS1 cell line (See Supplementary Fig. S2). We also
observed that IL6 inhibition leads to a modest increase in release
of EGFR ligands (HB-EGF, TGFa, and EGF) by the cells (data not
shown).
EGFR family members are overexpressed in approximately
70% of ovarian cancers and this is associated with a poor prognosis (12, 13). However, single-agent targeting of ErbB-1 has
shown minimal activity in patients with ovarian cancer (13, 14).
Our results suggested that combination therapies targeting both
the EGFR and IL6 pathways might have therapeutic potential. To
investigate this, cells were treated with geﬁtinib, a selective inhibitor of the EGFR tyrosine kinase by binding to the ATP-binding site
of the enzyme (15). Geﬁtinib treatment alone decreased phosphorylation of ErbB-1 and ERK but induced pSTAT3 activation
(Fig. 1B), as previously described (16). In AOCS1, a combination
of geﬁtinib and the anti-IL6 antibody also decreased ErbB-1

phosphorylation and pERK levels, but in this instance, pSTAT3
activation decreased as well (Fig. 1B). Similar results were
obtained with the G33 cell line (Fig. 1B, right) and IGROV-1
cells (data not shown). Quantiﬁcation of these blots can be found
in Supplementary Fig. S3.
Combined therapy that targets IL6 and EGFR pathways reduces
proliferation in 2D and 3D cultures
To investigate the biologic relevance of these observations, we
studied growth of the cell lines in the presence of anti-IL6 and
geﬁtinib. AOCS1 and IGROV-1 cells were treated with the anti-IL6
antibody, geﬁtinib, or their combination. In 2D culture (Fig. 2A
and B), IL6 inhibition had no effect on cell proliferation as we
have previously reported (3). Geﬁtinib signiﬁcantly reduced cell
counts and this growth inhibition was greater in the combination
treatment group (Fig. 2A and B).
We next used a 3D cell culture system adapted from (17) that
mimics the microenvironment of the human omentum, a major
site of peritoneal cancer metastasis. The model consisted of
ﬁbroblasts embedded in a collagen matrix covered by a layer of

primary human mesothelial cells. AOCS1 cells were grown for 2
weeks in this system and then the area of malignant cell growth
was measured using ImageJ (Fig. 2C and D). Both anti-IL6 and
geﬁtinib reduced malignant cell growth in the organotypic cultures and the greatest inhibition was seen in the combination
treatment group (Fig. 2D).
ErbB-1 has a nuclear localization in ovarian cancer cells and
this is altered by IL6 inhibition
We also investigated the effects of anti-IL6 on EGFR in the
cells using immunoﬂuorescence and confocal microscopy.
Confocal images and z-stack analysis of the images revealed
that ErbB-1 was primarily located in the nucleus (nErbB-1) in
all three lines (Fig. 3A–C and Supplementary Fig. S4A, z-stack
top). This observation has been previously reported in some
ovarian cancer cell lines and human ovarian cancer biopsies
(18). Upon treatment with anti-IL6 antibody for 24 hours,
nErbB-1 staining was reduced and in some of the cells analyzed,
relocalized to the plasma membrane (Fig. 3A–C and Supplementary Fig. S4A, z-stack bottom). As an experimental control,
we also studied A549 cells, a lung adenocarcinoma cell line
with well-characterized cell surface expression of ErbB1. ErbB-1
remained at the plasma membrane whether or not the cells
were treated with anti-IL6 (Fig. 3D). In a control for the
speciﬁcity of antibody staining, IGROV-1 cells were treated
with siRNA to ErbB-1 or a scramble control, resulting in an
almost complete removed staining in both nucleus and cytoplasm (Fig. 3E and F). We then carried out nuclear and cytoplasmic fractionation of cells treated either with IgG control
antibody or the anti-IL6 antibody. Anti-IL6 treatment resulted
in a reduction of ErbB-1 in the nuclear fraction of IGROV-1 cells
at 24 hours and 3 days treatment with anti-IL6 (Fig 3G and H
and Supplementary Fig. S4B). Similar results were obtained
with AOCS1 (Supplementary Fig. S5A). Tubulin and nuclear
lamin antibodies were used to test separation of cytoplasmic
and nuclear fraction, respectively, conﬁrming the purity of the
fractions (Fig. 3G and H and Supplementary Fig. S5A).
Anti-IL6 antibodies and b-importin silencing both disrupt
ErbB-1 nuclear localization
Next, we tested the effects of geﬁtinib plus/minus anti-IL6 on
nErbB-1 (Fig. 4A). Geﬁtinib, anti-IL6 treatment, and their combination relocalized ERB-1 expression to the membrane.
The presence of growth factor receptors in the nucleus is
well documented in several human cancers and nuclear translocation of EGFR family members has been extensively
described (19–21), but the mechanism of translocation and
the role of EGF receptor family members in the nucleus of
malignant cells is still unclear (22–24). Others have reported
that ErbB-1 colocalizes and interacts with b-importin in thyroid cells to be translocated into the nucleus (19, 22, 24). We
therefore treated AOCS1 cells with b-importin siRNA. Knockdown of b-importin reduced nErbB-1; this was not observed
when AOCS1 cells were treated with scrambled control siRNA
(Fig. 4A).
Data from the above experiments were quantiﬁed using metamorph analysis software and correspond to an average of ﬁve
microscope ﬁelds per condition (Fig. 4B). The intensity of nErbB-1
was reduced after treating the cells with either anti-IL6 antibody,
geﬁtinib, or the combination of both agents (Fig. 4B). Studies

www.aacrjournals.org

have suggested that ErbB-1 interacts with other transcription
factors, such as STAT3, in the nucleus (25). Thus, we next performed coimmunoprecipitation to see whether ErbB1 colocalized
with STAT3. Figure 4C shows that immunoprecipitation of ErbB-1
pulls down STAT3 in AOCS1 cells, thus suggesting that IL6
inhibition and consequent STAT3 reduction in the nucleus might
offer a possible explanation for the reduction of ErbB-1 in the
nucleus.
Our work so far has shown that ovarian cancer cells are able to
compensate for reduced autocrine IL6 signaling by upregulating
the EGFR signaling pathway. In addition, it appears that in HGSC
cell lines, ErbB1 is located to the nucleus and that treatment with
either anti-IL6 antibody or geﬁtinib, or their combination, leads
to reinstatement of ErbB1 on the plasma membrane of AOCS1,
G33, and IGROV-1 cells.
To test whether treatment of ovarian cancer cells with both
geﬁtinib and anti-IL6 antibodies was able to enhance antitumor
activity, we conducted experiments in peritoneal xenografts.
Geﬁtinib in combination with anti-IL6 reduces tumor weight
in mouse xenografts
We grew IGROV-1 cells as intraperitoneal xenografts in nude
mice and treated the mice with the anti-human IL6 antibody,
geﬁtinib, or both in combination. Results of two independent
experiments were combined and data are shown in Fig. 5.
Twenty-one days after treatment, tumors were extracted and
weighed. IL6 inhibition reduced tumor weight as previously
shown (Fig. 5A; ref. 3). Geﬁtinib treatment alone was able to
signiﬁcantly reduce tumor weight compared with the IgG
control group. However, the combination of anti-IL6 antibodies and geﬁtinib was the most effective in reducing tumor
weight (Fig. 5A).
Histologic analysis of tumors collected from mice revealed a reduction of pSTAT3 with IL6 inhibition, which was
accompanied by an increase in pERK and pErbB-1 (Fig. 5B).
We next analyzed the cellular localization of ErbB-1 in the
xenograft sections. Results show that tumors from control
mice have nuclear ErbB-1. Tumors from mice treated with
anti-IL6, geﬁtinib, or the combination have mainly plasma
membrane ErbB-1 (Fig. 5C) as previously suggested in Fig. 3.
To assess further the effect of anti-IL6 on the EGFR and
IL6 pathways in vivo, we extracted protein from the mouse
tumors and assessed the expression of pSTAT3, pErbB-1, and
pERK. IL6 inhibition in vivo effectively reduced pSTAT3 activation and led to an increase in pErbB-1 and pERK (Fig. 5D).
In addition, we used these lysates to demonstrate that in vivo,
IL6 inhibition reduces TNFa and Jagged1 levels (Fig. 5E), two
components of the IL6 tumor cytokine network that we
previously described (3).
A summary diagram of our results is shown in Fig. 6.

Discussion
Although many preclinical studies and clinical observations
suggest that IL6 inhibitors would be of therapeutic beneﬁt in
patients with advanced cancers (1, 3, 6, 8), clinical trials have
not shown conclusive evidence of activity, apart from in
patients with Castleman disease, which is primarily driven by
IL6. In our clinical trial of a therapeutic anti-IL6 antibody in
patients with HGSC, we found some evidence of disease stabilization but this was not sustained (3). All our evidence to

date would suggest that the effects of IL6 in this disease are
driven by constitutive malignant cell production of IL6 (3, 6–
8). Thus we investigated the possibility that IL6 inhibition

In our study, treatment with the anti-IL6 antibody did not
completely abrogate STAT3 phosphorylation. IL6 is not the
only cytokine/growth factor that activates STAT3, hence neutralizing IL6 would not always be expected to completely
abrogate STAT3 phosphorylation. However, experimental data

in the literature would suggest that partial STAT3 abrogation is
therapeutically signiﬁcant. For example, tumor cells that
become dependent on persistent STAT3 signaling are more
sensitive to STAT3 inhibition than normal cells (26). In experiments with a lymphoma model, partial downregulation of
STAT3 (40%) was responsible for strong antitumor effects in
vivo (27) and in colon cancer xenografts, partial inhibition of
JAK/STAT3 signaling pathway is enough to suppress the growth
of colon cancer xenografts (28).
In addition, our previous research on cytokine networks in
malignant cells (7) would suggest that rational combination of
therapies targeting the malignant cells and their interaction with
the microenvironment is worthy of investigation.
Links between the IL6 and EGFR pathway have already been
reported (29–32). For instance, EGFR stimulation of ovarian
cancer cell lines increased IL6 production (29), but none of the
cell lines used in the latter paper are now thought to be of
HGSC origin (9). In addition, in human lung adenocarcinomas,
mutations in the EGFR kinase domain stimulated STAT3 activation via IL6 production (30).
Hence we decided to study the inﬂuence of IL6 inhibition on
EGFR signaling. The cell lines that we used in our experiments
did not have EGFR mutations (data not shown). In this paper,
we have used cell lines and primary tumor cells from peritoneal
cancers that are collectively termed "ovarian" cancers. As
explained in the methods section, AOCS1 and G33 are new
cell lines recently established from HGSC patient biopsies. The
primary cancer cells used in our experiments were from path-

ologically conﬁrmed HGSC patient ascites. The cancer of origin
of the ovarian cancer cell line IGROV-1 is uncertain (33). We
have included it in our experiments as an example of an IL6
producing cell line that forms peritoneal xenografts in nude
mice (3).
Our results led us to test combinations of anti-IL6 and
geﬁtinib and our experiments suggested that this may have
therapeutic potential. However, our recent increased understanding of the natural history and genetic drivers of HGSC
(34–36) means that some of the cell lines and syngeneic
models (e.g., ID8 cells) are not relevant models of the disease.
A new genetic model of HGSC has recently been published (37)
and in the next few years as this, or transplantable cell lines
derived from such mice, become more widely used, we should
have more appropriate models of HGSC for preclinical experiments. IL6 produced by malignant cells has paracrine actions
not only on angiogenesis, but also on the extent and phenotype
of the leukocyte inﬁltrate (3, 7). Hence, a combination of IL6
and EGFR inhibition may be more powerful in a syngeneic
model or in patients with HGSC compared with the results
described here using immunocompromised mouse xenograft
models.
Nuclear EGFR signaling is thought to confer resistance to
various anticancer therapies (23) and may explain the poor
response of patients with ovarian cancer to geﬁtinib (38). All the
cells used in this paper were resistant to the anti-EGFR antibody
cetuximab (data not shown) and there was no interaction
between cetuximab and anti-IL6. The nuclear expression of

ErbB-1 may explain this ﬁnding (20). The partial restoration of
membrane-localized ErbB-1 by anti-IL6 antibody treatment may
not be sufﬁcient to permit inhibition by cetuximab.

IL6 Inhibition Upregulates EGFR Signaling

Figure 6.
Model for mechanism of action of IL6 and ErbB-1 signaling inhibition. In control conditions, EGFR and IL6 signaling pathways interact. STAT3 translocates to
the nucleus where it interacts with ErbB-1. When IL6 signaling is inhibited, there is a reduction in available STAT3 in the nucleus. Cells compensate for
IL6 inhibition by activating EGFR family members. nErbB-1 levels are decreased because there is less STAT3. As a result, ErbB-1 expression becomes more
prominent at the plasma membrane and this is sustained when inhibition of IL6 is combined with ErbB-1 signaling inhibitors.

combination.
