BACKGROUND: In the current study, the authors examined the outcomes of patients with desmoid tumors who
received systemic therapy at a single institution to provide a basis for the examination of newer agents. METHODS:
Records of patients with desmoid tumors who were treated with chemotherapy at the study institution were
reviewed. The activity of nonsteroidal anti–inflammatory drugs was not addressed. Patients without measurable disease and those receiving therapy could not be documented, and those receiving prophylactic therapy were excluded.
RESULTS: A total of 68 patients received 157 lines of therapy. At the time of last follow–up, 9 patients had died, 7 of
progressive disease. The cohort was 62% female, with a median age of 32.5 years. Approximately 32% of the patients
had Gardner syndrome. The median follow-up was 63 months, and patients received a median of 2 lines of therapy.
An intra-abdominal primary tumor location was the most common (44%). The greatest Response Evaluation Criteria
in Solid Tumors (RECIST) response rate was observed with anthracyclines and hormonal therapy and the lowest
response was noted with single-agent dacarbazine/temozolomide or tyrosine kinase inhibitors, principally imatinib.
On multivariate analysis, macroscopic nodular morphology and the presence of Gardner syndrome were the only tumor factors found to be associated with a greater time to disease progression. CONCLUSIONS: Compared with other
agents, antiestrogens and anthracycline-containing regimens appear to be associated with a higher radiological
response rate against desmoid tumors. Systemic therapy can be successful in patients with desmoid tumors, and is a

Deep fibromatoses, also termed desmoid tumors, are rare, slow growing, histologically bland connective tissue neo-

plasms without metastatic potential.1,2 Their incidence is estimated at 3 to 4 cases per million, with fewer than 1000 cases
diagnosed in the United States annually.3 Desmoid tumors account for approximately 3% of all biopsy-analyzed, soft tissue tumors. Desmoid tumors are typically diagnosed in patients between the ages of 15 and 60 years, more often in young
adults, with a 2-fold to 3-fold female predominance. The incidence of desmoid tumors is particularly high in patients
with familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP); the reported incidence in this patient population ranges widely (3.5-32%).3-7
Although surgery remains the primary therapy for extra-abdominal and abdominal wall desmoid tumors, observation alone is increasingly recommended for static lesions, given the morbidity associated with surgical resection and frequent disease recurrence.8 Surgery is often not feasible for patients with mesenteric desmoid tumors because of the
diffuse nature of the tumor throughout the mesentery in some patients, as well as a high risk of disease recurrence and

frequent postoperative complications. Alternative options
are therefore required for patients with tumors that are
not amenable to surgery.3,9
Although aggressive fibromatoses do not demonstrate metastatic potential, morbidity can lead to physical
impairment, and mortality from the disease is occasionally
observed as a result of local infiltrative growth and tissue
invasion, in particular with abdominal disease. Mortality
is rare among patients with extra-abdominal desmoid
tumors. However, desmoid tumors are associated with
patient death in approximately 10% of patients with
FAP.3
The natural history of this disease is becoming
increasingly well understood, but remains difficult to predict.2,8 Some patients develop disease progression despite
all locoregional options for care. For patients with progressive disease that is no longer amenable to surgery or
radiotherapy, systemic therapy can play a significant role
in improving clinical outcomes. To our knowledge to
date, there are no comparative studies of systemic therapy
to guide the treatment of patients with desmoid tumors.
The purpose of the current study was to analyze a highly
selected group of patients with recurrent or unresectable
desmoid tumors and their radiological responses to systemic treatment to guide treatment decisions when
patients develop disease recurrence, and to provide a baseline for comparison for future clinical trials.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patient Selection
We identified 183 patients seen in medical oncology clinics at the study institution who received systemic therapy
for a desmoid tumor between 1994 and 2007, using an
institutional review board-approved waiver of authorization. Data were also available from an institutional database of patients with soft tissue tumors who were
admitted for inpatient care, 304 of whom were admitted
between 1994 and 2007. Case files and chemotherapy
records were reviewed for all patients. A total of 115
patients were excluded because of incomplete records, the
administration of chemotherapy outside the study institution, or the exclusive use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs as systemic therapy. These exclusions left 68
patients who were analyzed for response to systemic treatment. Patient demographics, tumor characteristics, number of surgical resections, use of radiotherapy, and
systemic treatment response were analyzed. All pathology
was reviewed at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center

and confirmed the diagnosis of deep fibromatosis (desmoid tumor). Measurements were extracted from departmental radiology reports; consulting radiologists at the
study institution confirmed measurements for images
with incomplete data.
Demographics, Definition of Disease
Progression, and Statistical Analysis
Data extracted as part of this retrospective analysis included
patient age at diagnosis, patient gender, radiological desmoid morphology (nodular vs diffuse), presence or absence
of Gardner syndrome, primary tumor site, primary tumor
size, other primary cancer diagnoses, use of radiotherapy,
date of diagnosis, date of presentation, date of last followup, survival date, survival status, number of lines of therapy,
first and last dose dates of systemic therapies, duration of
systemic therapy, reason for treatment discontinuation,
date of last scan before the initiation of a given systemic
therapy, scan dates and outcomes on therapy, scan dates after the discontinuation of therapy, date of disease progression, time to disease progression, overall survival, and best
response to treatment by World Health Organization
(WHO) criteria10 and Response Evaluation Criteria in
Solid Tumors (RECIST) (version 1.0).11
To calculate progression-free survival (PFS), we
defined progressive disease to be radiological worsening
by the defined criteria (WHO or RECIST) or clinical disease progression in the setting of lesser radiological disease
progression. For 142 of the 157 lines of therapy administered, we had pretreatment and post-treatment radiographs available. For the remaining 15 lines of therapy,
we had only radiology reports and clinical notes on which
to base a determination of disease progression. Estimates
of PFS were determined with Kaplan-Meier analysis
(SPSS statistical software, version 15.0; SPSS Inc, Chicago, Ill), using a baseline scan date (performed within 05 weeks of the initiation of systemic therapy) as Time 0
and the date of the restaging scan as the date of disease
progression. Patients were censored for toxicity or surgical
intervention. Overall survival data were compiled using
the date of biopsy or the date of the initial surgical resection as Time 0.
The prognostic significance of patient gender, primary tumor site (abdomen vs other), age (< or  the median age), primary tumor size, presence of Gardner
syndrome, and nodular versus diffuse desmoid type were
examined by univariate analysis using a log-rank test. To
examine the association between tumor features and PFS
while adjusting for important prognostic factors, those

RESULTS
Patient Population
Patient demographics are specified in Table 1. A total of
68 patients received 157 lines of radiologically well-documented systemic therapy at the study institution between
1994 and 2008. The median age of the patients was
32.5 years (range, 15-75 years), with a female predominance of 62% (n ¼ 42 patients). Of the 68 patients, 11

(16%) had a primary tumor measuring <5 cm; 19 (28%)
had a primary tumor measuring between 5 and 10 cm; 34
(50%) had a primary tumor measuring >10 cm, including 5 patients with multifocal desmoid tumors (lesions
affecting >1 primary site), as has been described previously12; and 4 (6%) patients had an unknown primary tumor size. The most common primary tumor locations
were intra-abdominal (36 patients [44%]) followed by the
chest wall (11 patients [16%]). Consistent with the high
proportion of intra-abdominal primary tumors noted, 22
(32%) patients also carried a diagnosis of Gardner syndrome. The median follow-up was 5.3 years (range, 0.313.3 years). The primary size and anatomic site of tumors
in patients treated with chemotherapy were different from
those of patients from our institutional surgical database.
Patients with desmoid tumors of the abdomen and retroperitoneum were over-represented in the chemotherapy
cohort, and those with truncal desmoid tumors were
found to be under-represented in comparison with the
patients admitted to the hospital (Table 1). Not surprisingly, patients receiving chemotherapy had larger tumors

overall compared with those who were admitted to the
hospital (generally for surgery).

Systemic Therapy
Although nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs
(NSAIDs) were administered to some patients, we could
not accurately document when the agents were administered, the dosages used, or patient compliance. Most commonly, treatment was initiated with ibuprofen or sulindac
after surgical resection as a prophylactic measure. We did
not identify any patients with radiological responses to
NSAIDs, and focused on other systemic therapy without
recording the administration of NSAIDs.
Specific therapeutics and the order given were at the
discretion of the treating physicians (Table 2). Patients
who were treated had evidence of disease progression by
physical or radiological examinations. The most common
systemic therapies included tamoxifen, doxorubicin
(including pegylated liposomal doxorubicin), and
imatinib.
The 68 patients received 157 lines of therapy,
for which we could document clinical or radiological
responses. Of these, pretherapy and post-therapy
images were available for review for 142 lines of therapy (ie, radiological assessments 0-5 weeks before the
initiation of therapy and scans after at least 6 weeks
of therapy, except for those patients with overt disease
progression that was documented radiologically before
6 weeks). For the remaining 15 lines of therapy, we
used clinical and radiology records to determine time
to disease progression. Radiological results were
assessed by RECIST and WHO criteria. In many
cases, after radiological (and symptomatic) improvement, systemic therapy was discontinued and patients
were followed radiologically and clinically. Time to
disease progression was documented when there was
disease progression according to RECIST or WHO
criteria, with patients being censored for drug toxicity
or another local intervention.
The median number of lines of therapy given to
a patient was 2 (range, 1-7 lines of therapy); the median time to disease progression for all lines of therapy was 7.4 months (range, 0.7-125 months). A total
of 26 patients (38%) received 1 line of therapy, 22
(32%) patients received 2 lines, and 20 (29%)
patients received 3 lines of therapy. The frequency
of RECIST PRs was different between the treatment
arms of the study (P ¼ .048, Fisher exact test),

suggesting that the choice of treatment was important

Responses were most common in patients receiving
anthracycline-containing regimens. Figure 1 shows a
waterfall plot of the best RECIST responses for different
classes of systemic therapeutics. Twenty-eight of the 35
patients receiving anthracyclines received single-agent
doxorubicin in some form. Three of 6 patients receiving
doxorubicin achieved a RECIST PR as their best result,
and 8 of 22 patients who received pegylated liposomal
doxorubicin experienced a RECIST PR. Of the 35
patients receiving anthracyclines, 1 patient with a cumulative lifetime dose of 885 mg/m2 of doxorubicin given over

pegylated liposomal doxorubicin over 18 months; the latter patient also developed myelodysplastic syndrome, and
was receiving darbepoetin support at the time of last follow-up. Both demonstrated an improvement in their cardiomyopathy with medical management.
Progression-Free Survival
PFS, as observed for each line of systemic therapy, is
shown in Figure 2 and the median PFS by RECIST and
WHO criteria are indicated by the type of therapy in

current study, we did not examine the type of systemic
therapy or line of therapy and their correlation with PFS.

The variables found to be independently predictive of
superior PFS were the nodular (vs diffuse) type of desmoid tumor and the presence of Gardner syndrome. On
multivariate analysis, both variables remained statistically
significant (Table 3).

RECIST and WHO Responses
The best responses by WHO criteria and RECIST (Table 2)
for each line of therapy were compared for patients for
whom response data were available (n ¼ 142 lines of therapy). Using RECIST, a best result of PR and disease progression was observed in 21% and 15%, respectively, of patients;
using WHO criteria, the percentages were 19% and 23%,
respectively, of patients. The median best radiological result
for systemic therapy was 0% according to WHO criteria and
þ3% by RECIST.
There was no apparent difference in best radiological outcome when comparing each best response result
using RECIST and WHO criteria (2-sided P value ¼ .69,
Wilcoxon signed rank test). In contrast to the response
data by type of therapeutic agent, categorizing best radiological responses (PR, SD, or disease progression) by
response criteria (WHO or RECIST) did not yield a significant difference (P ¼ .19, Fisher exact test)

Overall Survival
The high–risk nature of this group of patients is indicated
in Figures 3A and 3B. Nine patients died of local disease
progression from their desmoid tumors. Two others died
of primary peritoneal serous tumors associated with Gardner syndrome, but were censored in this analysis at the
time of death. Eight of the 9 patients who died of disease
progression of a desmoid tumor died of a primary abdominal or abdominal wall desmoid tumor; 1 died of local disease progression at the thoracic outlet. Seven of the
patients had desmoid tumors associated with Gardner
syndrome compared with the overall group of 22 patients
who had Gardner syndrome in association with their desmoid tumor. Desmoid-related mortality was found to be
significantly associated with Gardner syndrome (P ¼ .01,
log-rank test). The median survival of the patients with a
desmoid tumor in association with Gardner syndrome in
this cohort was 13.5 years (95% confidence interval, 9.317.7 years).

DISCUSSION
Given the relative toxicity of the choices for systemic therapy, we generally treat patients with desmoid tumors
using a course of hormonal therapy before considering cytotoxic agents or tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Beyond antiestrogens,13 an important report of the utility of the
combination of cyclophosphamide, vincristine, doxorubicin, and dacarbazine has made a significant impact regarding systemic therapy for desmoid tumors.14 The finding
of patient responses to tyrosine kinase inhibitors15 raised
the question of the relative activity of systemic agents in
this patient population. Because there was no clear synergy between the drugs in this combination, we have

2263

Original Article

generally opted to administer single agents for patients
with desmoid tumors who are in need of systemic therapy,
occasionally using combinations for patients with more
symptomatic tumors. Until there are randomized studies
comparing therapeutic agents, we hope that the data from
the current study will inform clinicians as to options for
care when systemic therapy is needed.
Similar to any retrospective analysis, reservations
regarding the data from the current study include the lack
of randomized data; the use of a nonstandard metric for
disease progression using both radiographic and clinical
changes; and the collection of data over nearly 15 years,
during which time options and quality of surgery, radiotherapy, radiology, and supportive medication have
improved, potentially biasing any conclusions. Furthermore, the occasional observation of a patient with spontaneous improvement in their desmoid tumor or responses
to NSAIDs, neither of which were taken into account in
this analysis, would only lower the observed response rates
to systemic therapy noted herein. These data indicate a
higher radiological response rate against desmoid tumors
for anthracycline–based therapy and hormonal therapy,
more than receptor tyrosine kinase-directed agents or
single–agent dacarbazine or temozolomide, which is
consistent with other nonrandomized data from other
centers.9,13-18
We note that as single agents, both doxorubicin and
liposomal pegylated doxorubicin are active against desmoid tumors. In an appropriate patient, one who typically
fails hormonal therapy, liposomal pegylated doxorubicin

2264

represents a reasonable option with a lower risk of cardiac
and other toxicities compared with the parent agent, and
is now our typical first–line cytotoxic therapy for patients
in need of such an agent. Given the favorable side effect
profile and response data, hormonal therapy would
appear to be the most appropriate comparator arm for a
randomized study of systemic therapeutic agents.
The difficulty of managing desmoid tumors in association with Gardner syndrome is also underscored by the
data from the current study, with a significant risk of
death from desmoid tumors noted in this population
compared with patients with desmoid tumors that arise
sporadically, despite the demonstration of an association
with better PFS in desmoid tumor patients with Gardner
syndrome compared with those without the syndrome. It
is also clear that mutation analysis of APC and CTNNB1
will be important in the future analysis of these tumor
samples,19-23 which could potentially better inform the
choice of systemic therapy.
The management of desmoid tumors remains multidisciplinary, necessitated by the diversity of patient presentations and treatment options.2,7 Caution must be
exercised at every step of treatment given the potential
morbidity of any therapy, be it surgery (functional loss,
risk of disease recurrence), radiotherapy (loss of function
as a late side effect, risk of secondary cancers such as sarcomas), or chemotherapy (cardiomyopathy or treatmentassociated myelodysplasia or leukemia, as observed in the
current study). We anticipate improvements in outcomes
for patients as we learn about the molecular characteristics

of this molecularly heterogeneous condition. In the
interim, the data from the current study have demonstrated that systemic therapy is a viable option in lieu of
potentially morbid and debilitating surgery for patients
with this frustrating diagnosis.
