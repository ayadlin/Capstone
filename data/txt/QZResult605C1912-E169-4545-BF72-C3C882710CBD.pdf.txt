ABSTRACT
The triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) subtype is enriched in cancer stem cells
(CSCs) and clinically correlated with the highest rate of recurrence. Several studies
implicate the RSK pathway as being pivotal for the growth and proliferation of CSCs,
which are postulated to drive tumor relapse. We now address the potential for the
newly developed RSK inhibitor LJI308 to target the CSC population and repress TNBC
growth and dissemination. Overexpression of the Y-box binding protein-1 (YB-1)
oncogene in human mammary epithelial cells (HMECs) drove TNBC tumor formation
characterized by a multi-drug resistance phenotype, yet these cells were sensitive to
LJI308 in addition to the classic RSK inhibitors BI-D1870 and luteolin. Notably, LJI308
specifically targeted transformed cells as it had little effect on the non-tumorigenic
parental HMECs. Loss of cell growth, both in 2D and 3D culture, was attributed to
LJI308-induced apoptosis. We discovered CD44+/CD49f+ TNBC cells to be less
sensitive to chemotherapy compared to the isogenic CD44-/CD49f- cells. However,
inhibition of RSK using LJI308, BI-D1870, or luteolin was sufficient to eradicate the
CSC population. We conclude that targeting RSK using specific and potent inhibitors,
such as LJI308, delivers the promise of inhibiting the growth of TNBC.

INTRODUCTION

required to sustain the growth of estrogen-receptor
negative breast cancer suggesting it may be a relevant
target [6, 7]. Soon following, RSK2 was validated as a
target for TNBC in vitro and in vivo with the unique ability
to eliminate the cancer stem cell (CSC) population which
is believed to give rise to tumor recurrence [8]. In patients,
RPS6KA3 mRNA is associated with TNBC [9] and poor
outcome [8]. In the genesis of TNBC, RSK1 and RSK2 are
upregulated as a consequence of expression of the Y-box
binding protein-1 (YB-1) oncogene [10]. To date, there
have been a small number of pan-RSK inhibitors reported,
notably SL0101 [11], BI-D1870 [12], and luteolin [13].
However these small molecules are not highly specific for
RSK and therefore more selective small molecules were
recently developed, LJI308 and LJH685 [14]. Herein,
we evaluated the potential of the new pan-RSK inhibitor
LJI308 in inhibiting the growth and survival of TNBC.

Despite being identified as particularly aggressive
with high rates of relapse and poor survival over a decade
ago, treatment and management of triple-negative breast
cancer (TNBC) remains a significant clinical problem
[1, 2]. Attacking these tumors with anthracycline-based
chemotherapies does not improve outcomes [3]. By virtue
of the fact that TNBCs are distinguished by the expression
of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) reliance
on the MAPK pathway may be their Achilles heel [4],
a notion supported by small-molecule screens [5].
Unfortunately, EGFR inhibitors were met with repeated
disappointment in clinical trials suggesting that other
constituents of the MAPK pathway may be better targets.
Large screening efforts using small interfering RNAs
identified RPS6KA3 (encoding RSK2) as being absolutely

Further, we addressed its utility in preventing tumor
recurrence by eliminating the CSC population, which we
show is resistant to most traditional chemotherapies.

CSC-enriched intermediate (Fig. 1A), the phenotypes of
which are summarized in Table 1 [10]. This process was
driven by a self-activation loop between YB-1 and RSK
(Fig. 1B) [10]. The tumorigenicity of these transformed
cells was dependent on the level of YB-1 oncogene
expression (Fig. 1C) and also correlated with RSK (Fig.
1D). Cultures established following long-term YB-1
over-expression (HTRY-LT1 and HTRY-LT2) formed

RESULTS
Our group recently reported that induction of YB-1
could transform HMECs into carcinoma cells through a

tumors when transplanted into mice that were molecularly
subtyped as TNBC [10]. The sensitivity of these cell
lines to three commonly utilized therapeutic agents was
measured at their approximate IC50 values reported in the
established MDA-MB-231 TNBC breast cancer cell line:
50 µM 5-fluorouracil [15], 10 µM gefitinib [16], and 10
nM doxorubicin [17] (Fig. 1E). The HTRY-LT cell lines
exhibited broad resistance to these therapies (Fig. 1E).
We therefore questioned whether administration of RSK
inhibitors could increase the efficacy of conventional
chemotherapy. HTRY-LT cells were treated with a sublethal dose of RSK inhibitor, 1 µM BI-D1870 or 10 µM
luteolin, alone or in combination with 5-fluorouracil,
gefitinib, and doxorubicin. A sub-lethal dose of the RSK
inhibitors were selected based on the respective IC50 values
reported in other TNBC models [8, 13]. As expected,
treatment with BI-D1870 and luteolin alone had little to no
effect on cell viability; however, a synergistic combinatory
effect was observed with 5-fluorouracil, gefitinib, and
doxorubicin (Fig 1F). Specifically, cell viability decreased
by more than 80% with the combination treatments (Fig.
1F). These data suggest that a RSK inhibitor could be used

in combination with traditional chemotherapy to increase
drug efficacy.
A hurdle in translating current generation RSK
inhibitors into the clinic has been their lack of specificity,
for example, BI-D1870 also reportedly targets Aurora B
and PLK1 as well as other kinases at high doses [12, 14].
Therefore, there has been a concerted effort to develop
highly specific and potent RSK inhibitors, the most recent
being LJI308 [14]. Treating HTRY-LT cell lines with
increasing doses of LJI308 (1-10 µM) decreased cell
viability by up to 90%; however, little to no effect was
observed in the non-tumorigenic HTRZ control cells after
4 or 8 days (Fig. 2A, 2B). The cell lines proliferate at a
similar rate [10] and thus the decrease in cell growth and
viability can be directly attributed to LJI308 treatment.
Notably, LJI308 also suppressed the growth of HTRYLT cells in 3-dimensional soft agar cultures (Fig. 2C).
A similar result was observed with the TNBC cell lines
MDA-MB-231 and SUM149 (Fig. 2D). The decrease
in cell growth was attributed to apoptosis based on an
increase in annexin V-positive apoptotic cells following
LJI308 treatment (Fig. 3A). These effects were mediated,

at least in part, by the ability of LJI308 to inhibit the
activation (phosphorylation) of the oncogenic YB-1
transcription factor (Fig. 3B).
Due to the proposed role of CSCs in mediating
tumor recurrence [18, 19], we wanted to evaluate whether
LJI308 could not only eradicate bulk tumor cells but
also this highly tumorigenic subpopulation. HTRY-LT
cells were grown in spheroid cultures to enrich for CSCs
[20], which could be repressed by treatment with LJI308
(Fig. 4A). This effect was mirrored using siRNA against
RSK1 and RSK2 or alternatively by exposing cells to BID1870 (Fig. 4B). We subsequently isolated the CD44+/
CD49f+ CSC population from the HTRY-LT cell line by
FACS (Fig. 4C). As expected the CSCs over-expressed
CD44 (Fig. 4D) and were found to be largely resistant
to paclitaxel, 5-fluorouracil, gefitinib, and doxorubicin
chemotherapy relative to the CD44-/CD49f- non-CSC
population. We therefore questioned whether CSCs could
be eradicated by a lethal IC90 dose of RSK inhibitor: 2
µM BI-D1870 [8], 5 µM LJI308, or 50 µM luteolin [13].
We observed a significant decrease in both CSC and nonCSC cell viability, with LJI308 demonstrating the greatest
efficacy (Fig. 4E). These data strongly suggest that CSCs
are refractory to traditional chemotherapy, but sensitive to
RSK inhibitors.

and disseminate within one year of treatment [21].
Therefore, there is a strong clinical rationale that underlies
the search for new targeted therapies. RSK represents a
promising targeting point as it phosphorylates numerous
downstream substrates associated with cell proliferation
and motility [22]. We report the RSK inhibitor LJI308
as one of the first potent and effective targeted therapies
for TNBC that, unlike currently utilized drugs, exhibits
efficacy in eliminating the CSC population.
CSCs are widely accepted to be strongly therapy
resistant and drive tumor dissemination and poor outcome
in many cancer types, including breast [23]. Because
these cells are enriched in residual breast cancer tumors
following chemotherapy they may be responsible for
driving relapse [23]. Accordingly, targeting CSCs could
represent a promising therapeutic strategy for TNBC, a
notion supported by the fact that these tumors have the
highest percentage of CD44-positive CSCs compared
to the other breast cancer subtypes [24]. Our group has
previously reported that TNBC CSCs are dependent on
RSK for growth and survival [8]. We have now further
validated RSK as a bona fide target in new models of
TNBC and identified a specific inhibitor LJI308 that is
active in TNBC. Treatment with LJI308 induced apoptosis
to eradicate both the CSC and non-CSC populations,
suggesting it could be a “silver bullet” that not only
debulks the tumor but also targets the “seeds” for cancer
regrowth. This is particularly relevant in light of recent
studies suggesting that non-CSCs are plastic and can
acquire a CSC phenotype [25, 26]. Thus, eradication of
existing CSCs may not be sufficient and RSK inhibitors
that also target the non-CSCs may be mandatory.

DISCUSSION
Currently, there are no targeted therapies for TNBC,
the most lethal form of breast cancer. While conventional
chemotherapy is widely used and initially highly effective,
the effect is short-lived; these tumors rapidly re-emerge

While a major concern in the development of CSC
directed therapies is that signaling pathways active in
CSCs may also be crucial for normal stem cell survival
it has been reported that RSK2 knockout mice develop
a normal haematopoietic stem cell compartment [27].
Moreover, our group has shown that treating hematopoietic
stem cells with BI-D1870 has little effect at doses toxic to
CSCs [8]. Together, this suggests RSK is uniquely linked
to the CSC population and, as such, targeting it with
inhibitors such as LJI308 has important implications in
overcoming drug resistance and treating TNBC.
While our present research has focused on TNBC,
RSK is also expressed in other subtypes of breast cancer.
In HER2 amplified breast cancer, for example, activation
of RSK has been directly linked to trastuzumab resistance
[28]. The impact of this study likely transcends breast
cancer as RSK has also been linked to drug resistance
in other cancer types including prostate cancer [29],
melanoma [30], and pediatric medulloblastoma [31].
In conclusion, we propose that the use of RSK
inhibitors, such as LJI308, in combination with
conventional chemotherapy could be used to overcome
drug resistance and improve survival in patients with
TNBC. The unique ability of these drugs to target the CSC
population might provide sustained remission.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Apoptosis analysis was performed with flow
cytometry using the Annexin V:PE Apoptosis Detection
Kit (BD Biosciences, Mississauga, Canada). Cells were
stained with annexin V (1:20) on ice for 20 minutes prior
to analysis.

Proteins were harvested in erythrocyte lysis buffer
(ELB) supplemented with protease and phosphatase
inhibitors (Roche, Mississauga, Canada), run on a
12% SDS polyacrylamide gel, and transferred to a
nitrocellulose membrane. The following antibodies were
used: YB-1 (clone EP2708Y; Epitomics, Burlingame, CA,
USA), p-YB-1Ser102 (Cell Signaling, Danvers, MA, USA),
and vinculin (clone V284; Millipore, Etobicoke, Canada).

Cell viability assay
Cells were plated at a density of 5000 cells/well
into 96-well plates. At the endpoint, cells were fixed with
2% paraformaldehyde/PBS and stained with Hoechst
33342 (1 µg/ml; Sigma-Aldrich) for 30 minutes at
room temperature. Plate analysis was performed using
an ArrayScan VTI high content screening instrument
(Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). Hoechst
33342-stained nuclei were used as a measure of cellularity.

Cell lines and treatments

Soft agar assay

H16N2 HMECs expressing YB-1 (HTRY) or LacZ
(HTRZ) under the control of a tetracycline-inducible
promoter were cultured in F-12 media (Gibco, Burlington,
Canada) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), as
previously described [10, 32]. MDA-MB-231 (ATCC,
Manassas, VA, USA) and SUM149 (Asterand, Detroit,
MI, USA) cells were cultured as recommended. Cells
were treated with the following drugs: 5-fluorouracil
(Sigma-Aldrich, Oakville, Canada), BI-D1870 (Centre
for Drug Research and Development, Vancouver, Canada),
doxorubicin hydrochloride (Sigma-Aldrich), gefitinib
(AstraZeneca, Mississauga, Canada), LJI308 (Novartis
Pharma AG, Basel, Switzerland), luteolin (SigmaAldrich), and paclitaxel (Sigma-Aldrich).

Cells were embedded in soft agar medium (0.6%
agarose) at a density of 5 x 103 per well in a 24-well plate.
Drug treatments were replenished weekly. Colonies were
quantified at 21-28 days, depending on the cell line.

Mammosphere assay
Cells were washed through a 40 μm filter to obtain
a single-cell suspension and seeded at 2 x 104 per well
into ultra-low attachment 6-well culture plates (Corning,
Corning, NY, USA) in MammoCult Basal media
(StemCell Technologies, Vancouver, Canada). Spheres
with a minimum diameter of 50 μm were counted at 7
days. For serial passaging, mammospheres were collected
by centrifugation at 350g for 2 minutes, dissociated with
0.25% trypsin, and re-seeded.

Quantitative PCR
RNA was isolated using an RNeasy mini kit
(Qiagen, Mississauga, Canada) and reverse transcribed
using SuperScript III (Invitrogen, Burlington, Canada).
Pre-designed Taqman Gene Expression Assays labelled
with a FAM reporter (Applied Biosystems, Streetsville,
Canada) were used to detect transcript level.
