Enhances the Alarmin-Associated Abscopal Beneﬁts of
Tumor Radiotherapy

Abstract
Radiotherapy can produce antitumor beneﬁts beyond the local site of irradiation, an immune-based
phenomenon known as the abscopal effect, but the mechanisms underlying these beneﬁts are poorly understood.
Preclinical studies of ECI301, a mutant derivative of macrophage inhibitory protein-1a, have shown that its
administration can improve the antitumor effects of radiotherapy in a manner associated with a tumorindependent abscopal effect. In this article, we report that i.v. administration of ECI301 after intratumoral
injection of tumor cell lysates can inhibit tumor growth, not only at the site of injection but also at nontreated
sites. Effects of the tumor lysate were further recapitulated by i.v. administration of the alarmins HSP70 or
HMGB1, but not HSP60, and combinations of ECI301 þ HSP70 were sufﬁcient to inhibit tumor growth. Although
injection of ECI301 þ HMGB1 did not inhibit tumor growth, we found that administration of a neutralizing
HMGB1 antibody neutralized the cooperative effects of ECI301 on tumor irradiation. Moreover, mice genetically
deﬁcient in TLR4, an immune pattern receptor that binds alarmins, including HMGB1 and HSP70, did not exhibit
antitumor responses to irradiation with ECI301 administration. Although ECI301 was cleared rapidly from
peripheral blood, it was found to bind avidly to HSP70 and HMGB1 in vitro. Our results suggest a model in which
sequential release of the alarmins HSP70 and HMGB1 from a tumor by irradiation may trap circulating ECI301,
thereby licensing or restoring tumor immunosurveillance capabilities of natural killer cells or CD4þ and CD8þ T
cells against tumor cells that may evade irradiation. Cancer Res; 74(18); 5070–8. 2014 AACR.

Introduction
There are various limitations to chemotherapy of solid
tumors using classic cytotoxic agents that act intensively on
rapidly dividing cells. Delivery of agents to the core of the
tumor mass is often difﬁcult and tumor cells with slower
growth rates or with quiescent cells due to poor nutrient
and/or oxygen supply respond to chemotherapy much more
modestly, if at all. Over time, tumor cells acquire resistance to
various agents. The most serious problem with this kind of
treatment, however, seems to be the myelo- and immunosuppressive effect of such agents. As a result, various leukocytes,
which play important roles for host defense and should simultaneously cooperate with the treatment, cannot act on the

remaining tumor cells that have evaded treatment. In fact,
dramatic reduction of numbers of various leukocytes are
normally observed during and after chemotherapy and, as a
result of the extensive treatments, the numbers of lymphocytes
become very low and do not recover to normal levels (1).
Incidentally, cooperative action of the host defense mechanism
is essential for eradication of infected bacteria when treating
patients with antibiotics, and, hence, infection control by
antibiotics is difﬁcult in compromised hosts even when the
patient has a minor defect like opsonin deﬁciency (2).
On the other hand, there are also limitations in curative
radiotherapy, because in this case, also, slowly dividing cells or
cells with low metabolic activity are less sensitive to ionizing
radiation. In addition, tumor cells under hypoxic conditions
are insensitive to irradiation that mediates most effects
through active oxygen species such as hydroxyl radicals generated from water and oxygen by radiolysis. Tumor cells
express hypoxia inducible factor-1a that allows the cells to
adapt to low-oxygen conditions (3, 4). One notable advantage
of local radiotherapy, in contrast with systemic chemotherapy
is, however, that the host defense system can act on the
remaining cells soon after irradiation. In fact, inﬂammation
induced by irradiation is known to play a signiﬁcant role in
remission of tumor growth and to affect the prognosis of the
patient.

molecules (DAMP) such as heat shock proteins (HSP),

Alarmins in ECI301-Enhanced Local Antitumor Treatments

high-mobility group box-1 protein (HMGB1), S100 proteins,
and hepatoma-derived growth factor are reportedly released
by irradiation (5–8). HSP70 is a molecular chaperone that
translocates to the outer leaﬂet of the plasma membrane
during tumor cell death and is released from the necrotic cells
(9, 10). This protein works to activate natural killer (NK) cells
and to present associated peptides to antigen-presenting cells
(APC; ref. 11). HMGB1, a 215 amino acid chromatin–binding
protein overexpressed in tumor cells, is released from dying
cells and acts at several levels of the immune response,
including promotion of inﬂammation by recruitment and
activation of dendritic cells and tumor-speciﬁc T cells (12–
14). However, a series of these events after irradiation is usually
not enough to eradicate the remaining tumor cells.
Previously, we showed that ECI301, a recombinant variant of
human MIP-1a (CCL3), enhanced the antitumor radiation
efﬁcacy of subcutaneously growing tumor cells (15). In nearly
half of mice treated by this combination therapy, tumors were
completely eradicated and rechallenged syngenic tumor cells
were rejected. In similar experiments, reduction of tumor
growth distant from the irradiated site was found to be
consistently induced and this phenomenon (called the abscopal effect, an effect distal to the target), observed in BALB/c and
C57BL/6 mice, was tumor-type independent. The effect of
ECI301 was shown to be diminished by an antitumor chemotherapeutic agent, docetaxel, when administered before
ECI301 injection, suggesting that the agent affected the recruitment and function of leukocytes, which are essential for tumor
eradication.
Because enhancement of tumor growth inhibition by ECI301
was not attributable to radiation alone but also shown to other
factors such as the heat generated from high-frequency alternating current, namely radiofrequency ablation (RFA; ref. 16),
we supposed that substances released during treatment may
cause inﬂammation at tumor-bearing sites and play important
roles in tumor growth inhibition. In this article, we show that
intratumor injection of tumor lysate mimics these treatments,
and HSP70 and HMGB1, which seem to be induced by local
antitumor treatments, play crucial roles in tumor regression
and reduction of tumor growth at nontreated sites (i.e., by the
abscopal effect that does not depend on radiation), probably by
binding administered ECI301. These results reveal an underlying mechanism of the combination therapy of radiation or
RFA treatment and i.v. injection of ECI301.

recombinant mouse HSP60, HSP70-A1, and HSP90 (all low
endotoxin) were from Enzo Biochem. The following antibodies
were used unless otherwise stated: Chikin anti-HMGB1 polyclonal antibody (IgY fraction), mouse monoclonal anti–hMIP1a (R&D Systems), anti-HSP70 antibodies (StressMarq) and
biotin-labeled, rabbit polyclonal anti–MIP-1a antibody (R&D
Systems).
Mice
Six-week-old male BALB/c, female C57BL6, male C3H/HeN,
and male C3H/HeJ mice were purchased from Nippon SLC
and housed in a barrier system with controlled light (12L:12D)
and temperature (22 C  2 C). They were fed a diet of mouse
chow and water ad libitum and used at 7-weeks-old. All
animal experiments were carried out in accordance with the
guidelines for animal experiments at the University of Tokyo
(Bunkyo, Tokyo, Japan).
Tumor cells
As descried previously (15), Colon26 adenocarcinoma cells
were provided by the Cell Resource Center for Biomedical
Research, Institute of Development, Aging and Cancer, Tohoku
University (Sendai, Japan) and MethA ﬁbrosarcoma and Lewis
lung carcinoma (LLC) cells were obtained from the American
Type Culture Collection. FM3A mouse mammary carcinoma
cells were obtained from the Human Science Research
Resource Bank (Osaka, Japan), which is resistant to 4-carbamoylimidazolium 5-olate. The cultures were maintained in
RPMI-1640 medium supplemented with 10% FBS, for no longer
than 12 weeks after recovery from frozen stocks. Culture
conditions were 37 C under humidiﬁed 5% CO2.
Tumor cell growth in vivo
Before tumor implantation, cells were trypsinized and ﬁltered through a 70-mm pore size cell strainer. When the mass of
solid tumor at the right ﬂank reached 5- to 10-mm diameter
(14–18 days after implantation), mice with similar-sized
tumors were selected and used for the experiments.
The tumor volume was calculated using the following
formula:
ðTumor volumeÞ ¼ ðMajor axisÞ  ðMinor axisÞ2  0:5236:

Materials and Methods

Tumor irradiation
Mice bearing tumors were held in the decubitus position,
and ionizing radiation (6 MeV-electron beam) was delivered to
the right ﬂank from just above the tumor (15).

Materials
Recombinant ECI301, a 69 amino acid variant of human
MIP-1a carrying a single amino acid substitution of Asp27 of
MIP-1a to Ara, was generated using an S. pombe expression
system (Asahi Glass Co. Ltd.) and puriﬁed to homogeneity (15).
Recombinant hMIP-1a was obtained using a Brevibacillus
choshinensis expression system (Protein Express) or purchased
from PeproTech. Migration rate of CCR1-expressing Jurkat
cells toward ECI301 was slightly higher than that toward
MIP-1a at lower concentrations when assayed using TAXIScan
(17). Bovine thymus HMGB1 was obtained from ShinoTest, and

In vitro binding study of ECI301 to HSP70 by

and the beads were suspended in 1-mL buffer. Fifty microliters
of antibody coupled beads (1 mg/5 mg antibody), and 25 mL
each of ECI301 (600 ng), HSP70-A1 (6 mg), biotin-labeled, rabbit
polyclonal anti–MIP-1a antibody (6 mg), hMIP-1a (600 ng) all
in PBS with 0.01% polysorbate80 or their combinations were

for 24 hours. The beads were washed carefully and subjected to
SDS–PAGE at 200V for 35 minutes after incubation in reducing
buffer at 70 C for 10 minutes. Immunoblotting was performed
using iBlot (Invitrogen) on polyvinylidene diﬂuoride (PVDF)
membranes according to the instruction manual. After blocking with ChemiBloker, the membrane was stained at room
temperature for 60 minutes with biotin-labeled, rabbit polyclonal anti–MIP-1a antibody and then under the same conditions with horseradish peroxidase (HRP)–labeled streptoavidin (Jakson; ﬁrst staining). The PVDF membrane was further
stained using mouse anti-HSP70 antibody and HRP-labeled
anti-murine immunoglobin G (American Quaiex; second staining). Chemiluminescence excited with the ECL Western Blotting Detection system (GE Healthcare) was detected using
image analyzer LAS4000 Mini (Fujiﬁlm).

Statistical analysis
Unless otherwise stated, data are presented as mean  SE.
For comparisons between groups in the in vivo study, we used
ANOVA. The signiﬁcance of the difference between the means
of two variables was determined by the Dunnett test unless
otherwise stated. A P value of <0.05 was considered signiﬁcant.

Results
Effect of i.v. administered ECI301 on tumor growth after
intratumor injection of tumor lysate
We predicted the presence of proteins that works in synergy
with ECI301 to promote inﬂammation at the local antitumor–
treated site. This prediction was made based on previous
ﬁndings, such as ECI301-enhanced efﬁcacy of antitumor radiation with the abscopal effect (15) and on the reported evidence of augmentation by ECI301 of RFA-induced antitumor
effect against non–RFA-treated hepatocellular carcinoma cells
(16). We examined whether intratumor injected tumor lysate
could recapitulate the effect of radiation or RFA in the combination treatment. Colon26 adnocarcinoma cells were
implanted subcutaneously in the right and left ﬂanks of
BALB/c mice and tumors were allowed to grow until the tumor
size of the right ﬂank reached 5- to 10-mm diameter. Tumor
lysate obtained from Colon26 cells by sonication was injected
to the center of the tumor mass in the right ﬂank. Animals
received ECI301 intravenously once a day for 5 consecutive
days starting from immediately after administration of tumor
lysate. As shown in Fig. 1, the rate of tumor growth was

Binding analysis of ECI301 to HMGB1 using Biacore
Changes in surface plasmon resonance were measured
using Biacore X (GE Healthcare), in which immobilized ECI301
or MIP-1a (Peprotech) was used as a "ligand" on the sensor
chip CM5 (using the Thio Coupling Kit) and a series of
concentration of HMGB1 was used as "analytes." Refraction
change at the surface was detected and recorded as resonance
units (RU) in the control software supplied and evaluated by
ﬁtting algorithms. RUs were measured during the binding and
washing periods, and the binding kinetics were analyzed using
BIAevaluation Software, version 3.0. RU values were used to
determine dissociation constant (Kd).

Effective replacement of tumor lysate with HSP70
It has been proposed that immunogenic tumor cell death is
characterized by a temporal sequence of events, including early
translocation and exposure of HSPs in the cell surface and their
release from the cells, followed by the late release of HMGB1
from dying cells (9, 10, 18). Among alarmins that might be
generated in the tumor-bearing site, we ﬁrst focused on HSPs
and carried out similar experiments as in Fig. 1 using HSPs
instead of tumor lysate. Intratumor injection of HSP70 followed by 5-dose i.v. administration of ECI301 (once a day for 5
consecutive days), resulted in signiﬁcant tumor growth inhibition not only at the injected site (Fig. 2, right) but also at the
nontreated site (Fig. 2, left). HSP70 without ECI301 administration and HSP60 with or without ECI301 administration
(Fig. 2) did not show such an effect. In other experiments,
when Colon26 cells were implanted in the right ﬂank of BALB/c
mice alone, the tumor in 1 of 5 mice was completely eradicated
by this treatment and the mouse survived beyond 60 days,
signiﬁcantly outliving all other mice.
We further found that i.v. injected mixtures of HSP70 and
ECI301 (once a day for 3 consecutive days) inhibited Colon26
growth without pretreatments such as radiation, RFA, or
intratumor injection of tumor lysate or HSP70 (Fig. 3 top). A
statistically signiﬁcant antitumor effect was found when a
mixture of ECI301 and HSP70, was given at 2 and 0.5 mg per
mouse (P < 0.01), or 10 and 2.5 mg per mouse (P < 0.05),
respectively, among various tested ratios and doses (ECI301/
HSP70: 2/0.125, 2/0.5 and 2/2.5, or 0.4/0.1, 2/0.5, and 10/2.5 mg/
mouse). The effect was restricted to HSP70 among the HSPs
tested and inhibition was not observed by i.v. administration of
a series of mixtures of ECI301/HSP60 (2/0.1, 2/0.5, and 2/2.5 mg/

could not mimic the effects of ECI301, and i.v. injection of a
mixture of ECI301/MIP-1a (0.4/0.1 or 2/0.5 mg/mouse) did not

but also at the noninjected site (top left). Administration of

found not to be restricted to that of Colon26, and other tumor
cell lysates such as from MethA ﬁbrosarcoma cells were also

Effect of anti-HMGB1 antibody on enhancement of
tumor growth inhibition by the combination treatment
of radiation and ECI301
To conﬁrm the role of HMGB1 in the combination treatment
of ECI301 administration after local irradiation, we investigated the effect of anti-HMGB1 antibody on enhanced tumor
growth inhibition. In these experiments, mice received antiHMGB1 antibody by i.p. injection (100 mg/mouse) two or three
times either; 3 hours before irradiation along with the ﬁrst
ECI301 administrations; or in addition 3 hours before the ﬁfth
ECI301 administration. In the right-ﬂank tumor in which
radiation was delivered (Fig. 5A), anti-HMGB1 antibody
(administered three times) diminished the ECI301 effect and
radiation effect, and tumor growth became comparable with
that without treatment (control). In the left-ﬂank tumor also
(Fig. 5B), signiﬁcant differences were ablated by the antiHMGB1 antibody. Similar results were also obtained without
a third injection of the antibody.

Fig. S1C). The tumor growth inhibitory effect of the mixture
of ECI301 and HSP70 was also found with MethA-bearing
BALB/c mice (Fig. 3, lower).
Effect of intratumor injection of HMGB1 followed by i.v.
administered ECI301 on tumor growth
We detected a 30 kDa band of HMGB1 in the sonicated
tumor lysate from Colon26 cells by Western blottings: both in
the supernatant and the precipitate obtained after centrifugation at 20,000  g for 15 minutes (data not shown). We,
therefore, examined whether HMGB1 could also replace tumor
lysate or HSP70. Similar experiments using a Colon26 cells/
BALB/c mice system as described above were performed using
HMGB1 instead of HSP70. When tumor size of the right ﬂank
reached approximately 10-mm diameter, HMGB1 (50 ng/
mouse) was given to the center of the tumor mass in the right
ﬂank. Animals received ECI301 intravenously ﬁve times (once a
day for 5 consecutive days) after HMGB1 administration. As
shown in Fig. 4, tumor growth in both ﬂanks was markedly
inhibited by the combination treatment of HMGB1 injected to
the right-side tumor and i.v. administered ECI301. HMGB1
injected to the tumor mass without i.v. administration of
ECI301 did not inﬂuence tumor growth (Fig. 4, PBS).

dendritic cells and other immune cells, we studied whether the
combination therapy with radiation and ECI301 is effective in
the mice whose TLR4 function is defective. In these experiments, FM3A carcinoma cells were implanted subcutaneously
in both ﬂanks of C3H/HeN and C3H/HeJ mice. Fifteen days
after implantation when the tumor size reached approximately
10-mm diameter, mice received 6 Gy at the right-ﬂank tumor
and ECI301 was administered i.v. once a day for 5 consecutive
days starting 20 hours after irradiation. In control C3H/HeN
mice, enhanced antitumor radiation efﬁcacy and induction of
the abscopal effect were observed with i.v. administered
ECI301 (Fig. 6A and B). In contrast, neither signiﬁcant enhancement of antitumor radiation efﬁcacy nor induction of the
abscopal effect with ECI301 was observed in C3H/HeJ
(Fig. 6C and D).
Tumor-speciﬁc IFNg production by splenocytes from
tumor-bearing mice after combination treatment
In a previous study (15), we showed by depletion of CD4þ T
cells, CD8þ T cells, and NK1.1 cells that these cells play
important roles in tumor regression during the combination
treatment of radiation and ECI301 administration. To further
conﬁrm the involvement of cytotoxic T cells, we evaluated,
using ELISPOT assay, whether treatment with ECI301 following ionic irradiation increases the number of cells that can
promote tumor-speciﬁc IFNg production in the spleen, by

www.aacrjournals.org

using LLC cell–bearing C57/BL6 mice. We found that splenocytes from tumor-bearing mice 3 days after ECI301 administration (4 days after irradiation) contained signiﬁcantly higher
numbers of cells that can secrete IFNg (Supplementary Fig. S2).
This response was speciﬁc to a particular tumor-bearing type
(LLC), and was not detected spontaneously or in response to
another heterotypic tumor cell type (MethA). Administration
of ECI301 without irradiation did not increase the number of
cells that capable of secreting tumor-speciﬁc IFNg in the
spleen.
Binding of ECI301 to HSP70 and HMGB1 in vitro
It was reported that highly puriﬁed HSP70 and HMGB1
can stimulate the immune system only by binding other
molecules (22–24). We tested whether ECI301 binds to these
molecules. To ﬁnd interactions between ECI301 and HSP70,
we performed coimmunoprecipitation analysis using Dynabeads coupled with anti–MIP-1a antibody or anti-HSP70
antibody (anti–MIP-1 beads or anti-HSP beads, respectively).
A series of mixtures containing anti–MIP-1 beads together
with either ECI301 alone, ECI301þHSP70, ECI301þanti–
MIP-1a antibody, and a mixture containing anti-HSP beads
together with either HSP70 alone, HSP70þECI301, or
HSP70þhMIP-1a, were incubated at 4 C for 24 hours in a
rotator. As shown in Fig. 7, lane 2, HSP70 was precipitated
with anti–MIP-1 beads in the presence of ECI301. On the

Figure 7. Coprecipitation of ECI301 and HSP70 or HMGB1. The anti–
hMIP-1a antibody (murine)–coupled magnetic beads were used for lanes
1–3 and incubated with ECI301 alone (lane 1), ECI301þHSP70 (lane 2),
and ECI301þbiotin–labeled anti–MIP-1a antibody (lane 3). The antiHSP70 antibody (murine)–coupled magnetic beads were used for
lanes 4–6 and incubated with HSP70 alone (lane 4), HSP70þECI301 (lane
5), HSP70þhMIP-1a (lane 6). Molecular markers were shown
in lane 7 (kDa). The bottom bands in lanes 1–3, and 5 are those of ECI301
and in lane 6, is that of MIP-1a, all of which were detected by the ﬁrst
staining. The bottom bands of ECI301 and MIP-1a in lanes 5 and 6,
respectively (boxed), were those coprecipitated with HSP70. In lanes 2
and 4–6, the upper boxed bands are of HSP70, which appeared
from the second staining. The HSP70 band in lane 2 is the one
coprecipitated with ECI301. The upper two major bands seen in lane 1
and corresponding bands in lanes 2–6 are those of the heavy and light
chain of antibodies (anti–MIP-1a antibody from beads/lanes 1 and 2;
anti–MIP-1a antibody from beads þ biotin–labeled anti–MIP-1a
antibody added to the sample/lane 3; anti-HSP70 antibody from
beads/lanes 4–5). These bands were not detected by the ﬁrst staining
except those in lane 3.

other hand, ECI301 was coprecipitated with HSP70 bound to
anti-HSP beads (lane 5). When MIP-1a was used instead of
ECI301, it also precipitated with anti-HSP beads but to a
lower extent (lane 6). These results indicate that HSP70 can
form a stable complex with ECI301 and, to a lesser extent,
with MIP-1a.
We could not show any interaction between ECI301 and
HMGB1 in vitro, by similar coprecipitation studies using anti–
MIP-1 beads. We then evaluated changes of surface plasmon
resonance upon interaction between these molecules using
Biacore X (GE Healthcare). As a "ligand" on the sensor chip,
ECI301 or MIP-1a was immobilized and responses to a series of
concentrations of HMGB1 were determined. The Kd value of
HMGB1 obtained with ECI301 was 3.7  108. The value
obtained with MIP-1a (3.0  107) was 10-fold higher than
that obtained with ECI301. The results indicate that ECI301
binds also to HMGB1. This binding afﬁnity and stability were
much stronger than those of MIP-1a.

Cancer Res; 74(18) September 15, 2014

In this study, we have presented evidence to support the
notion that HSP70 and HMGB1, alarmins known to be released
early and lately from dying tumor cells after irradiation or other
local anticancer treatments, bind to i.v. administered ECI301
and play a crucial role in tumor regression by stimulating host
defense mechanisms. As we reported previously (15), a significant number of CD4þ and CD8þ T cells inﬁltrated tumors at
the irradiated and nonirradiated sites when ECI301 was
administered after irradiation, and that depletion of any of
CD8þT, CD4þ T, or NK1.1 cells using antibodies diminished the
enhanced antitumor and abscopal effects by ECI301. Involvement of T cells in the enhancement of radiation efﬁcacy at the
irradiated site was further conﬁrmed by rejection of rechallenged syngenic tumor cells in the tumor-eradicated mice. We
showed in this article that splenocytes in tumor-bearing mice
treated with radiation and ECI301, contained a signiﬁcant
number of cells with potential to secrete IFNg upon exposure
to the tumor cells, suggesting that systemic tumor-speciﬁc
immunity is inducible by such CD8þ T cells inﬁltrating to the
tumor-bearing site.
A chaperone protein, HSP70 is reported to be overexpressed
in many tumors (25) especially at the plasma membrane (26).
Overexpression of HMGB1 has also been reported in most
tumor cells (27, 28), and has been shown to be closely associated with various characteristics of tumor cells, including
unlimited cell division (29). This may explain why ionizing
radiation delivered to a tumor-bearing site but not to normal
tissues is required to elicit the effect of ECI301 (15). We found
that HMGB1 was present in tumors (in lysates) both in free and
bound forms, though an increase of serum levels of HMGB1
after radiation treatment or following ECI301 administration
was not detected (unpublished observation). The result suggests that the enhancement by ECI301 only takes place inside,
or close to, the tumor-bearing site at least in the case of
HMGB1. It is well known that HMGB1 develops enhanced
proinﬂammatory activity by binding to various cytokines (30)
and that necrotic cells deﬁcient for HMGB1 have a strongly
reduced ability to activate APCs (31). Although further studies
are required to elucidate the relationship between the HSP70/
ECI301 and HMGB/ECI301 complexes, the latter complex may
work subsequently to the former because HSP70 is released
before HMGB1 (9), HSP70 induces HMGB1 (18), and antiHMGB1 antibody diminishes the effect of combination treatment of irradiation and ECI301.
We found not only that intratumor injection of HSP70
followed by ECI301 administration inhibited tumor growth
both in treated and untreated sites, but also that i.v. injected
mixtures of HSP70 and ECI301 inhibited tumor growth. A
mixture of 2 and 0.5 mg per mouse ECI301 and HSP70,
respectively, was most effective among the various tested
ratios and doses. In contrast with HSP70, i.v. injected HMGB1
even together with ECI301 did not inhibit tumor growth,
although intratumor injection of this molecule followed by i.v.
administration of ECI301 inhibited tumor growth. Although
we could not demonstrate stable complex formation between
ECI301 and HMGB1 by coimmunoprecipitation studies,

Alarmins in ECI301-Enhanced Local Antitumor Treatments

signiﬁcant interaction between these molecules was shown
by changes of surface plasmon resonance upon interaction.
The obtained Kd value of HMGB1 with ECI301 was 3.7  108,
much lower than the value reported for peptide antigen
versus antipeptide (IgG) antibody (between 105 and 106).
These results also support the assumption that the enhancement by ECI301 only takes place inside, or close to, the tumorbearing site in case of HMGB1. Various receptors are known
to interact with HSP70 and HMGB1 and, among them, TLR4
and TLR2 seems to be important in mediating HSP70- and
HMGB1-induced inﬂammatory responses (19, 20, 32–37).
These receptors are known to respond to HSP70 and HMGB1
only after binding to other molecules (22–24). A HSP70/or
HMGB1/ECI301 complex seems to react with TLR4 because,
in the TLR4-deﬁcient mice, the combination effect of radiation and ECI301 was not observed. Patients with breast
cancer carrying a TLR4 loss-of-function allele are reported
to relapse more quickly after radio- and chemotherapy (32).
It is interesting to note that MIP-1a could not mimic its
variant ECI301, and i.v. injected mixtures of HSP70 and
MIP-1a did not inhibit tumor growth. As compared with
ECI301, MIP-1a does not efﬁciently bind to HSP70 and the
Kd value of HMGB1 with MIP-1a was 10 times higher than
ECI301. These results suggest that these lower binding
activities make biologic activity of MIP-1a weaker than
ECI301. In fact, we found that MIP-1a could not reproduce
the effect of ECI301 in the combination treatment with
radiation (unpublished observation). It has been reported
that the basic unit of one MIP-1a molecule is a dimer,
whose primary contact is constituted by two antiparallel b
strands formed by an N-terminal loop (38, 39). In MIP-1a
molecules, the hydrogen bonds between Asp27 and Arg46/
Arg48 residues, and between Asp6 and Ser33, and the
hydrophobic interaction between Tyr28 and Phe24 residues
are proposed to contribute to the interaction between the
two dimers, and subsequent polymer formation. In ECI301,
whose basic unit is also a dimer, Asp27 of MIP-1a is
substituted with Ala. MIP-1a forms a double-helical polymer burring its receptor-binding sites, whereas substitution
of Asp27 with Ala results in irregular polymers with possible
dissociation (39). The ECI301 molecule used in the present
investigation was found to be a mixture of tetramer (76%),
dimer (20%), and polymers larger than tetramer (the
remainder) at mg/mL concentration and no signiﬁcant
difference of this ratio was found at 10 mg/mL (unpublished
results). Further study is required to clarify the differences
in anticancer activity between ECI301 and MIP-1a in the
combination treatments.
Finally, the difﬁculty in eradication of tumor cell mass
merely by antigen-speciﬁc killer T cells or by the combination of alarmins and ECI301 described here must be
remarked upon, because even 1 g of tumor mass contains
approximately 109 cells. For example, the number of mice
cured by treatment with both HSP70 and ECI301 was much
lower than by the combination of irradiation and ECI301, in
which nearly half of the mice were cured (15). Before or
during the period when the host-defense system plays its
part, other means are essential to eliminate or injure the

www.aacrjournals.org

bulk of tumor cells, as in the case of antibiotics in bacterial
infection, which contribute to eliminate the majority of
infected bacteria. The proposed concept, namely, local
anticancer treatments that induce inﬂammation at the
tumor-bearing site by irradiation or RFA followed by i.v.
administration of ECI301, is based on this assumption, and
supported by experimental evidence shown in this and
previous articles (15, 16). RFA treatment of tumors is known
to induce tumor-speciﬁc immune responses and is used as
an eradicative treatment, though the treatment is often not
sufﬁcient to prevent tumor recurrence. ECI301 injection
augmented the RFA-induced antitumor effect against non–
RFA-treated tumors in the same animal. In contrast with
the anti-solid tumor strategies described here, inﬂammation induced by cyclooxgenase (COX)-2, overexpressed in
tumor cells, seems to play a substantial role in "initiation" of
oncogenesis, and COX-2 inhibitors are effective in preventing tumor growth by inhibiting proliferation and inducing
apoptosis of tumor cells, and release from immunosuppression via regulatory T-cell activation (40). Thus, both strategies do not seem incompatible.
All these studies mentioned above lead to the development of therapeutic applications of ECI301, and a clinical
trial using combination of radiation and i.v. administrated
ECI301 for patients with advanced or metastatic cancer,
as well as a clinical trial for RFA followed by i.v. administration of ECI301 for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma are about to commence in the United States and
Japan.

Correction: Macrophage Inﬂammatory
Protein Derivative ECI301 Enhances the
Alarmin-Associated Abscopal Beneﬁts of
Tumor Radiotherapy
In this article (Cancer Res 2014;74:5070–8), which appeared in the September 15,
2014, issue of Cancer Research (1), the authors have corrected two sentences in the
abstract so that it more accurately reﬂects the rest of the article. The corrected abstract
is below.
Radiotherapy can produce antitumor beneﬁts beyond the local site of irradiation, an
immune-based phenomenon known as the abscopal effect, but the mechanisms
underlying these beneﬁts are poorly understood. Preclinical studies of ECI301, a
mutant derivative of macrophage inhibitory protein-1a, have shown that its administration can improve the antitumor effects of radiotherapy in a manner associated
with a tumorindependent abscopal effect. In this article, we report that i.v. administration of ECI301 after intratumoral injection of tumor cell lysates can inhibit tumor
growth, not only at the site of injection but also at nontreated sites. Effects of the
tumor lysate were further recapitulated by intratumoral injection of the alarmins
HSP70 or HMGB1, but not HSP60, and i.v. administration of ECI301 þ HSP70 was
sufﬁcient to inhibit tumor growth. Although i.v. administration of ECI301 þ HMGB1
did not inhibit tumor growth, we found that administration of a neutralizing HMGB1
antibody neutralized the cooperative effects of ECI301 on tumor irradiation. Moreover, mice genetically deﬁcient in TLR4, an immune pattern receptor that binds
alarmins, including HMGB1 and HSP70, did not exhibit antitumor responses to
irradiation with ECI301 administration. Although ECI301 was cleared rapidly from
peripheral blood, it was found to bind avidly to HSP70 and HMGB1 in vitro. Our
results suggest a model in which sequential release of the alarmins HSP70 and
HMGB1 from a tumor by irradiation may trap circulating ECI301, thereby licensing
or restoring tumor immunosurveillance capabilities of natural killer cells or CD4þ
and CDþ T cells against tumor cells that may evade irradiation.
