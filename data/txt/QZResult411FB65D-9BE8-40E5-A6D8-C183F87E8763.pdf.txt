Abstract
Intermittent oxygen deﬁciency in cancers promotes prolonged inﬂammation, continuous angiogenesis,
and increased drug resistance. Hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF1) has a pivotal role in the regulation of
cellular responses to oxygen deﬁciency. The a-subunit of HIF1 (HIF1a) is degraded in normoxia but
stabilized in hypoxia. However, the molecular mechanism that controls oxygen-independent degradation
of HIF1a has remained elusive. Human rhomboid family-1 (RHBDF1) is a member of a large family of
nonprotease rhomboids whose function is basically unknown. We report here that RHBDF1 expression in
breast cancer is highly elevated and is strongly correlated with escalated disease progression, metastasis,
poor prognosis, and poor response to chemotherapy. We show that RHBDF1 interaction with the receptor of
activated protein-C kinase-1 (RACK1) in breast cancer cells prevents RACK1-assisted, oxygen-independent
HIF1a degradation. In addition, we show that the HIF1a-stabilizing activity of RHBDF1 diminishes when the
phosphorylation of a tyrosine residue on the RHBDF1 molecule is inhibited. These ﬁndings are consistent
with the view that RHBDF1 is a critical component of a molecular switch that regulates HIF1a stability in
cancer cells in hypoxia and that RHBDF1 is of potential value as a new target for cancer treatment. Cancer

Introduction
Intermittent oxygen deﬁciency in cancer microenvironment
promotes prolonged inﬂammation, continuous neovascularization, and escalated drug resistance. The transcription factor
hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF1) predominantly regulates cellular responses to oxygen deﬁciency, including the expression of
genes required for tissue oxygen delivery and energy metabolism in developmental, physiologic, and pathologic conditions
such as ischemic cardiovascular disease, stroke, and cancer (1).
HIF1 is a heterodimer composed of a- and b-subunits. HIF1b
level is maintained constitutively, whereas HIF1a under norAuthors' Afﬁliations: 1State Key Laboratory of Medicinal Chemical Biology and College of Pharmacy and 2Tianjin Key Laboratory of Molecular

moxic conditions is removed by oxygen-dependent prolyl
hydroxylation, ubiquitination, and proteasomal degradation
(2). In hypoxia, however, HIF1a level increases markedly as it
is continuously synthesized (3), whereas its oxygen-dependent
degradation is downregulated (2). An oxygen-independent
mechanism has been proposed to account for the modulation
of HIF1a in hypoxia (4), involving the receptor of activated
protein C kinase-1 (RACK1) and HSP90 (5). HSP90 is a molecular
chaperone that protects client proteins from misfolding and
degradation (6). HSP90 binding stabilizes HIF1a. RACK1 competes with HSP90 for binding to HIF1a. RACK1 also binds to
Elongin C and recruits other components of E3 ubiquitin ligases,
thus facilitating HIF1a ubiquitination and degradation in an
oxygen-independent manner (5). However, what this "molecular
switch" consists of and how it operates remain unclear.
The human rhomboid family-1 gene product RHBDF1 is a
protein found mainly within the endoplasmic reticulum and
Golgi complex (7). Rhomboids are 6 or 7 transmembrane
proteins that may be divided into two categories. Many
rhomboids are serine proteases, conserved across all kingdoms of life, and regulate biologic processes as diverse as
growth factor signaling, mitochondrial morphology, parasitic invasion, and bacterial protein translocation (8). The other
category of rhomboid proteins, present in all sequenced
metazoans, lack the known catalytic residues essential to
the function of serine proteases (9). Few functions of these
so called "inactive rhomboids," including RHBDF1, are
known. In Drosophila, noncatalytic rhomboids were shown
to prevent the cleavage of the substrates of rhomboid

proteases by promoting their destabilization by endoplasmic
reticulum–associated degradation (10). In human, RHBDF1
was shown to have a pivotal role in sustaining growth signals
in epithelial cancers (11, 12). RHBDF1 mRNA level is significantly elevated in clinical specimens of invasive ductal
carcinoma of the breast, and RHBDF1 gene silencing results
in apoptosis or autophagy in breast cancer or head and neck
cancer cells and inhibition of xenograft tumor growth (11).
RHBDF1 was found to participate in the modulation of Gprotein–coupled receptor-mediated transactivation of EGF
receptor (12). These ﬁndings indicate that RHBDF1 may
function as a regulatory protein involved in growth signal
transduction.
In this study, we discovered that RHBDF1 function is critical
for the maintenance of HIF1a stability in breast cancer cells in
hypoxia. We report here that elevated RHBDF1 expression in
breast cancer strongly correlates with escalated disease progression, poor prognosis, and poor responses to chemotherapy.
We show that RHBDF1 is an essential component of a "molecular switch," which also consists of RACK1 and HSP90 that
modulate oxygen-independent degradation of HIF1a. In addition, we demonstrate that disrupting the phosphorylation of a
tyrosine residue on the RHBDF1 molecule leads to diminished
HIF1a stability. These ﬁndings deﬁne a new function for a
nonprotease rhomboid gene and provide new insights into
the mechanism underlying the modulation of HIF1 activity in
hypoxia.

Materials and Methods
Cells
Human breast cancer cell lines MCF7, MDA-MB-231, T47D,
and human kidney 293 cell (all from American Type Culture
Collection) were maintained in Dulbecco's Modiﬁed Eagle
Medium (Lonza), 10% FBS, L-glutamate, penicillin and streptomycin. For hypoxic conditions, the cells were cultured in a
modular incubator chamber ﬂushed with mixed gas consisting
of 1% O2, 5% CO2, and 94% N2 at 37 C. For normoxic conditions,
mixed gas consisting of 20% O2, 5% CO2, and 75% N2 at 37 C
was used.
Reagents
Plasmids pBabe-HA-HIF-1a and pBabe-HA-HIF1a (P402A/
P564A) were gifts from Dr. W. G. Kaelin (Dana-Farber Cancer
Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA). FLAGRHBDF1 and GFP-RHBDF1 plasmid were described previously
(12). FLAG-RACK1 was constructed into pCI (Promega).
RHBDF1 short hairpin RNA (shRNA) retroviral vector was
derived from pSUPER.retro.puromycin (OligoEngine) and contains a 19-nucleotide sequence against RHBDF1 as described
previously (11, 12). 17-Allylamino-demethoxygeldamycin (17AAG) and antibodies against b-actin, HA, and FLAG were
purchased from Sigma. MG132 was from Calbiochem. Antibodies against RACK1, HSP90, HIF1a, p-Ser, PARP, and Caspase-8 were from BD Biosciences. Antibodies against caspase-3
and ubiquitin were from Cell Signaling Technology. Elongin C

synthesized, with the target sequences being 50 -GGGAUGAGAC CAACUAUGGtt (siRACK1 i), 50 -GGUAUGGAAC CUGGCUAACtt (siRACK1 ii), and 50 -GGGAAAGAUC AUUGUAGAUtt
(siRACK1 iii), respectively (13). The sequence of the RHBDF1
shRNA is (forward) GAGTGAGCAA GGACAGTGAT, as
reported previously (RH1–3; ref. 11). Four independent shRNA
29-mers against RHBDF1 and a scrambled shRNA sequence
were purchased from OriGene Technologies (cat# TF302009).
The sequences of the 4 RHBDF1 shRNA 29-mers are (forward):
GGCTTCTCGC AGCATGAGAC GGTGGACTC, ACCGCATAGC
CATCATCTAC CTGCTGAGT, TGGCAGCGCA AGAGCATCCG
TCACTGCAG, and CTGACCAGTT CTACCGCCTG TGGCTATCC, respectively. Antibody against phospho-tyrosine was
purchased from Abcam.
Clinicopathological analysis of breast cancer specimens
The Ethics Committee of the Cancer Hospital of Tianjin
Medical University (Tianjin, China) approved the use of human
tissues for this study. Each patient signed an informed consent
form for participation. Parafﬁn-embedded blocks of normal
breast and breast cancer tissues diagnosed in 2003 were
retrieved randomly from the archives of Cancer Hospital of
Tianjin Medical University. Patients were women 24 to 83 years
of age (mean age 52.6 years). Specimens were collected before
radiation or chemotherapy, or both. Histopathology was
reviewed and diagnosis conﬁrmed independently by two
pathologists (LF and FFL) using the WHO criteria (14). For
pathologic analysis of patient responses to chemotherapy,
breast cancer specimens were retrieved from archives diagnosed during 2007 to 2008. All invasive breast cancer (IBC)
specimens were obtained from patients who had completed
preoperative neoadjuvant chemotherapy consisted of 4 to 6
cycles of anthracycline-based or anthracycline and taxanebased regimen before surgery. Response to chemotherapy was
assessed according to Miller and Payne histologic grading
system (15): grade 1, no change or some alteration to individual
malignant cells but no reduction in overall cellularity; grade 2,
minor loss (up to 30%) of cancer cells but overall cellularity
remains high; grade 3, reduction of 30% to 90% of cancer cells;
grade 4, more than 90% loss of cancer cells but small clusters or
widely dispersed individual cancer cells remain; grade 5, no
malignant cells identiﬁable in sections from the site of the
tumor consisting of vascular ﬁbroblastic stroma, often containing macrophages; however, ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS)
may be present. In this study, grades 3 to 5 were regarded as
having a good response to chemotherapy, whereas grades 1
and 2 were regarded as having a poor response.
Immunohistochemistry
Tissue sections (4 mm thickness) were deparafﬁnized and
rehydrated. Antigen retrieval was performed at 121 C for 2
minutes, using citrate buffer (pH 6.0) for RHBDF1, ER, PR, CerbB-2, or EDTA solution (pH 8.0) for HIF1a. After blocking
with hydrogen peroxide and normal goat serum, the sections
were incubated with primary monoclonal antibody against
RHBDF1 (Abcam, cat# ab81342, 1:250 dilution) or HIF1a
(Abcam, cat# ab8366, 1:250 dilution) for 16 hours at 4 C. The

sections were sequentially incubated with biotinylated goat
anti-mouse immunoglobulin and peroxidase-conjugated
streptavidin (DAKO), and the substrate 3, 30 -diaminobenzidine
tetrahydrochloride. Sections incubated with only PBS served as
negative controls. RHBDF1 staining levels were classiﬁed using
a modiﬁed scoring method (16) based on staining intensity
(Supplementary Fig. S1A). Nuclear positivity of HIF1a was
deﬁned as the presence of perinecrotic or diffuse stained nuclei
(Supplementary Fig. S1B). A specimen was considered to
contain HIF1a-positive nuclei when more than 0% of nuclei
were positive (median value cut-off: 0%; ref. 17). There was a
positive correlation between cytoplasmic and nuclear positivity of HIF1a in the 263 IBC specimens we analyzed (Supplementary Fig. S1C). Interpretation and scoring of ER, PR, and
C-erbB-2 staining were described previously (18, 19).
Cell transfection
pSUPER-ShRHBDF1, pSUPER-ShScramble and pBabe-HAHIF1a (P402A/P564A) plasmids were each transfected into
PT67 packing cells (Clontech). The transfected cell culture
medium was then used to infect target cells. Cells were selected
with puromycin (Invitrogen) for 2 weeks. Human RACK1
siRNA and control siRNA (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were
used for transient transfection, using Lipofectamine 2000
(Invitrogen).
Immunoprecipitation and Western blotting
Cell lysis buffer contained 50 mmol/L Tris, pH 8, 150 mmol/L
NaCl, 0.1% SDS, 0.5% NaDoc, 1% NP-40, and protease inhibitors
(Roche). The lysates were centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 15
minutes at 4 C. For coimmunoprecipitation (co-IP) studies,
in which the extracts were incubated overnight at 4 C, then
with protein G or protein L-Sepharose beads (Santa Cruz
Biotechnology) for 2 hours at 4 C. The beads were washed
exhaustively with the lysis buffer. Immobilized proteins were
eluted with 2 Laemmli sample buffer and subjected to SDSPAGE and Western blotting analysis.
Statistical analysis
Student two-tailed t test was used to analyze the statistical
signiﬁcance of differences in continuous variables between two
groups. The Spearman correlation rank for nonparametric
variables was used to assess the relationships between the
categorical variables. Survival curves were calculated using the
Kaplan–Meier method, and the differences were estimated by
using the log-rank (Mantel–Cox) test. All statistical tests used a
two-tailed signiﬁcance level of P < 0.05.

Results
Elevated RHBDF1 expression in breast cancer correlates
with escalated disease progression
We compared RHBDF1 expression patterns in 343 clinical
specimens of breast cancer of various stages and normal
breast tissues by immunohistochemistry, using a four point
grading scale (, þ, 2þ, and 3þ for negative, weak, medium,
and strong, respectively; Supplementary Fig. S1). RHBDF1
levels were mostly undetectable in normal breast tissues

(n ¼ 20), but steadily increased in the order of atypical
ductal hyperplasia (ADH; n ¼ 10; Z ¼ 2.019; P ¼ 0.043 by
Mann–Whitney U test), DCIS (n ¼ 30; Z ¼ 2.032; P ¼ 0.042),
and IBC (n ¼ 263; Z ¼ 2.443; P ¼ 0.015; Fig. 1A). RHBDF1
expression level in normal tissue adjacent to cancer (n ¼ 20)
was also higher compared with that in normal breast tissues
(Z ¼ 3.106; P ¼ 0.002; Fig. 1A). The percentages of medium
and strong RHBDF1 expression (2þ/3þ) in normal, ADH,
DCIS, and IBC specimens were 0, 20, 24, and 55%, respectively (Fig. 1B). In addition, IBC patients with high RHBDF1
expression (2þ/3þ; n ¼ 146) exhibited a poorer overall
survival rate compared with patients with low RHBDF1
expression (/þ; n ¼ 117; P ¼ 0.0021; Fig. 1C). Progression-free survival was also markedly worse for patients with
IBC with high RHBDF1 expression than for those with low
RHBDF1 expression (P ¼ 0.0003; Fig. 1D). Moreover, we
examined the correlations between RHBDF1 expression
levels and a range of clinicopathologic parameters in the
IBC cases. The percentages of local recurrence in low and
high RHBDF1 groups were 2.6% and 9%, respectively (P ¼
0.029; Fig. 1E). The percentages of cases in RHBDF1 low and
high groups with metastasis to at least one positive lymph
node were 53% and 66%, and those with 10 or more were 15%
and 24%, respectively (P ¼ 0.027; Fig. 1F). The percentages of
distant metastasis in low and high RHBDF1 groups were
9.3% and 32.7%, respectively (P ¼ 0.012; Fig. 1G). There were
no statistically signiﬁcant differences between RHBDF1 low
and high groups with regard to age, tumor size, histologic
grade, TNM stage, estrogen receptor expression, progesterone receptor expression, and C-erbB-2 levels (Supplementary Table S1). Furthermore, we studied RHBDF1 expression
levels in the tumor specimens of 67 patients with breast
cancer who had completed a full protocol of neoadjuvant
chemotherapy before surgical excision of the tumor (refer to
Supplemental Materials and Methods for treatment detail).
We found that more than 80% of the cases in low RHBDF1
group had good responses in comparison with about 40% of
good responders in high RHBDF1 group (Fig. 1H). These
ﬁndings indicate that elevated RHBDF1 expression in breast
cancer is strongly correlated with facilitated disease progression, local recurrence, lymph node and distant metastasis, poor prognosis, and poor responses to chemotherapy.
Raising RHBDF1 expression levels in cancer cells leads to
enhanced HIF1a protein stability
To begin to investigate RHBDF1's role in breast cancer
progression, we compared RHBDF1 and HIF1a protein levels
in the IBC specimens, and found that the expression patterns of
the two are strikingly similar (rs ¼ 0.593, P < 0.0001; Fig. 2A).
Less than 30% of the patients in RHBDF1 low group exhibited
high HIF1a (2þ, 3þ), whereas in sharp contrast, about 75% of
the patients in RHBDF1-high group showed high HIF1a levels
(Fig. 2B). In addition, we found that the percentage of poor
responders to neoadjuvant chemotherapy was less than 20%
when both RHBDF1 and HIF1a levels are low, whereas it
reached about 70% when both RHBDF1 and HIF1a are high
(Fig. 2C). We thus overexpressed RHBDF1 by cDNA transfection in breast cancer T47D cells, which exhibit constitutively

levels in these cells resulted in a marked increase in HIF1a
levels in normoxia (20% O2; Fig. 2D) as well as in hypoxia (1%
O2; Fig. 2E; the ﬁrst two lanes). We cultured the cells in
hypoxia for 4 hours, and then placed them in normoxia, and

only high RHBDF1 levels are strongly correlated with
markedly enhanced HIF1a stability in breast cancer in
clinical settings as well as in cancer cell cultures under
either normoxic or hypoxic conditions, but RHBDF1 may
have a role in the modulation of HIF1a degradation.
RHBDF1 gene silencing leads to HIF1a destabilization
We determined the effect of RHBDF1 gene silencing on
HIF1a stability, using breast cancer cell line MCF7 cells, which
express high level of RHBDF1 (11). Transient transfection with
a shRNA against RHBDF1 (shRHB) under hypoxic conditions
caused a marked decline of HIF1a protein (Fig. 3A). To conﬁrm

www.aacrjournals.org

this ﬁnding, we treated the cells with a mixture of 4 speciﬁc
shRNA plasmids against RHBDF1. Western blotting analysis
results indicated that silencing the RHBDF1 gene led to marked
decline of HIF1a protein level in the cells under hypoxic
conditions (Supplementary Fig. S5). We also found much faster
HIF1a degradation during reoxygenation in shRHB-treated
cells than that in shScr-treated cells (Fig. 3B). Treatment of the
cells with shRHB in hypoxia led to a decreased nuclear accumulation of the HIF1a protein, which is consistent with a
reduction of HIF1a stability (Fig. 3C). To ﬁnd out whether
shRHB inhibited HIF1 activity, we analyzed the secretion of
VEGF, a target gene of HIF1a (20), by the cells. Treatment with

shRHB for 4 to 24 hours in hypoxia led to an approximately 50%
decrease in VEGF secretion into the culture media determined
by ELISA (Fig. 3D). A similar inhibition of hypoxia-induced
VEGF production by shRHB treatment was observed when the
experiment was repeated with human breast cancer cell line
MDA-MB-231 (Fig. 3E). We found that HIF1a mRNA levels
were not affected by RHBDF1 shRNA treatment of the cells;
however, the transcription of GLUT1, a target gene of HIF1,
diminished in RHBDF1-treated cells, consistent with
decreased HIF1a activities (Supplementary Fig. S2). These
ﬁndings indicate that RHBDF1 function is essential to the
maintenance of HIF1a protein stability and HIF1 activity in
breast cancer cells under hypoxic conditions.
RHBDF1 protects HIF1a from RACK1-facilitated oxygenindependent degradation
To investigate whether RHBDF1 modulation of HIF1a stability involved prolyl hydroxylase activity, we transfected MCF7
cells with a HA-tagged mutant HIF1a that had two proline-toalanine substitutions (P402A/P564A), which confers irresponsiveness to prolyl hydroxylase (21). We found that shRHB
treatment facilitated the degradation of the mutant HIF1a in
hypoxia, indicating an independence on prolyl hydroxylation
(Fig. 4A). We then cotransfected T47D cells with RHBDF1
cDNA and the mutant HIF1a, and found that raising RHBDF1
levels led to increased HIF1a stability in hypoxia (Fig. 4B). We
then examined whether RACK1 and HSP90 are involved in

RHBDF1-facilitated HIF1a stabilization. We ﬁrst treated MCF7
cells with both RHBDF1 shRNA and RACK1 siRNA, and found
that RACK1 siRNA treatment alone caused an accumulation of
HIF1a in the cells; however, HIF1a diminished when the
RHBDF1 gene was silenced at the same time (Fig. 4C and
Supplementary Fig. S6A). In addition, we cotransfected T47D
cells with RHBDF1 and the mutant HA-HIF1a, and treated the
cells with RACK1 siRNA. RACK1 siRNA treatment of the
RHBDF1-overexpressing cells signiﬁcantly enhanced HIF1a
stability (Fig. 4D and Supplementary Fig. S6B). To determine
the involvement of HSP90, we simultaneously treated MCF7
cells with RHBDF1 shRNA and 17-AAG, which inhibit HSP90
activity (6), and found that RHBDF1 gene silencing further
accelerated HIF1a degradation caused by 17-AAG treatment
(Fig. 4E). Moreover, we treated RHBDF1-overexpressing T47D
cells with 17-AAG, and found that RHBDF1-facilitated HIF1a
stabilization was signiﬁcantly abrogated by 17-AAG treatment
(Fig. 4F). These ﬁndings support the view that RHBDF1 activity
has an impact on the actions of RACK1 and HSP90 on HIF1a
stability.
To determine whether RHBDF1 physically interacts with
HIF1a or RACK1, we transfected human kidney 293 cell with
FLAG-tagged RHBDF1 either alone or together with HA-tagged
wild-type HIF1a. Co-IP analysis indicated that RHBDF1 was
able to bind to RACK1 (Fig. 4G) and HIF1a (Fig. 4H), but not to

siRACK1 or 17-AAG and carried out co-IP analysis. We found
that siRACK1 treatment enhanced HIF1a binding to HSP90,
whereas 17-AAG treatment led to more HIF1a binding to
RACK1 (Fig. 4J). These ﬁndings suggest that RHBDF1 overexpression lead to diminished RACK1-HIF1a interaction, thus
protecting HIF1a from RACK1-induced, oxygen-independent
degradation.
RHBDF1 inhibits RACK1 binding to HIF1a
To determine the effect of RHBDF1 gene silencing on RACK1
and HSP90 binding to HIF1a, we stably expressed shRHB in
MCF7 cells, and treated the cells with MG132. Co-IP analysis
revealed that shRHB inhibited HIF1a binding to HSP90 but, in
sharp contrast, enhanced HIF1a binding to RACK1 (Fig. 5A).
We then transfected the HA-tagged P402A/P564A mutant
HIF1a into these cells and treated them with either 17-AAG
or MG132, or both, in hypoxia. Ubiquitination of the HA-tagged
mutant HIF1a and HIF1a or Elongin C binding to RACK1 were
readily observed in shRHB-expressing cells when protein degradation was blocked with MG132, whereas HSP90 binding to
HIF1a diminished; 17-AAG treatment caused a further decline
of HSP90 binding to HIF1a; it is not immediately apparent to
us, however, as to why there appeared to be a reduction in the
ubiquitination of the mutant HIF1a upon treatment with 17AAG and shRHB together compared with shRHB alone (Fig.
5B). To determine the effect of elevated RHBDF1 levels on the
interaction between RACK1 and HIF1a, we transfected
RHBDF1 cDNA into T47D cells that were engineered to overexpress the P402A/P564A mutant HA-HIF1a, cultured the cells
in hypoxia, and carried out co-IP analysis (Fig. 5C). We found
that the mutant HIF1a became more stable and its binding to
RACK1 declined when RHBDF1 level was raised. Inhibition of
HSP90 activity with 17-AAG led to increased RACK1 or Elongin
C binding to HIF1a; however, these effects diminished in
RHBDF1-overexpressing cells. In addition, we carried out a
"pull-down" experiment to determine RHBDF1 impact on
RACK1 dimerization required for RACK1 binding to HIF1a
(22). We overexpressed FLAG-RACK1 in human kidney 293 cell,
isolated the protein by using an anti-FLAG antibody immobilized on agarose resin, and used the FLAG-RACK1–enriched
resin to isolate endogenous RACK1 from MCF7 cell homogenates. The MCF7 cells were engineered to express either
shRHB or shScr. We found that RACK1 dimerization became
more prominent in RHBDF1 gene-silenced cells in normoxia
and also in hypoxia in the presence of MG132 (Fig. 5D).
Moreover, consistent with a previous report that RACK1
dimerization gives rise to phosphorylation of serine-146 on
the RACK1 protein (22), we found that RHBDF1 gene silencing
led to enhanced serine phosphorylation of RACK1 (Fig. 5E).
These results indicate that RHBDF1 interaction with RACK1
prevents RACK1 dimerization, which in turn inhibits HIF1a
binding to RACK1.
Inhibition of RHBDF1 tyrosine phosphorylation causes
disruption of RHBDF1–RACK1 interaction and
facilitates HIF1a degradation
We carried out bioinformatics analysis on the primary
sequence of RHBDF1 and discovered a number of potential

2726

phosphorylation sites (Supplementary Fig. S3). We synthesized
a series of peptides with sequences corresponding to these
sites. A poly-arginine tag (R11) was added to each of the
peptides at the C-terminus to ensure entrance of the peptide
into the cells (23) in case some of these potential phosphorylation sites were located inside the cells (Supplementary Table
S2). We treated MDA-MB-231 cells with each of the peptides,
and found that peptide VR56, which mimics the amino acid
sequence ﬂanking tyrosine-848 of RHBDF1, was able to substantially inhibit VEGF production by the cells in hypoxia
(Fig. 6A) as well as the transcription of a number of HIF1targeted genes, including VEGF, GLUT1, CA9, and ET1 (Supplementary Fig. S4). VR56 treatment also facilitated HIF1a
degradation (Fig. 6B). A peptide identical to VR56 but without
the tag (VH36), or the R11 tag itself (ER20), did not exhibit these
activities. In addition, we found that VR56 treatment of
RHBDF1-overexpressing MCF7 cells in hypoxia led to a marked
inhibition of RHBDF1-enhanced HIF1a stabilization (Fig. 6C).
VR56 inhibition of RHBDF1-enhanced HIF1a stabilization was
dose dependent (Fig. 6D). VR56 also inhibited RHBDF1 tyrosine phosphorylation (Fig. 6E). Treatment of MCF7 cells with
VR56 resulted in a marked decrease of cell viability (Supplementary Fig. S4). We then treated RHBDF1- and RACK1-overexpressing MCF7 cells with VR56 in hypoxia, and found that
the treatment signiﬁcantly inhibited RHBDF1 binding to
RACK1 (Fig. 6F). When these experiments were carried out
in the presence of MG132, VR56 treatment inhibited RHBDF1
binding to RACK1 but enhanced HIF1a binding to RACK1 (Fig.
6G). These ﬁndings indicate that disruption of RHBDF1 tyrosine phosphorylation with VR56 leads to inhibition of RHBDF1
binding to RACK1, enhancement of HIF1a binding to RACK1,
and destabilization of HIF1a.

Discussion
On the basis of these ﬁndings, we propose a "molecular
switch" to explain RHBDF1 suppression of HIF1a degradation
in hypoxia (Fig. 7). In this mechanism, RHBDF1 is in a position
to control the competition of RACK1 and HSP90 for binding
to HIF1a. RHBDF1 binding to RACK1 either takes the latter
away from RACK1-HIF1a complex, or prevents RACK1 from
binding to HIF1a. The latter scenario appears to be more likely,
as RHBDF1 interaction with RACK1 results in an inhibition
of the phosphorylation of the RACK1 protein and a disruption of RACK1 dimerization, which are necessary for RACK1
binding to HIF1a. Disruption of RACK1 binding to HIF1a by
the action of RHBDF1 allows HIF1a to bind to HSP90 more
readily instead of binding to RACK1 and being taken into the
ubiquitin-Elongin C pathway for degradation. The action of
RHBDF1 thus shifts the balance toward HIF1a stabilization.
It has been suggested that competition between HSP90 and
RACK1 for binding to HIF1a may contribute to the establishment of the HIF1a "set point," which is a given HIF1a protein
level in a given type of cells (5). Inﬂuence of RHBDF1 on the
competition may have a signiﬁcant impact on such "set point".
Especially, considering that RHBDF1, RACK1, HSP90, and
HIF1a protein levels are all signiﬁcantly elevated in many
cancer cells and tumor tissues (11, 24, 25), RHBDF1 inﬂuence

on the equilibrium between HIF1a-RACK1 and HIF1a-HSP90
may have a pivotal role in the maintenance of HIF1a stability
under hypoxic conditions. It is plausible that this mechanism
underlies the association of RHBDF1 with clinicopathologic
parameters critical for the progression of the disease. As we
have shown, RHBDF1 protein is nearly absent or present at low
levels in normal mammary gland tissues, then changes to
moderate levels in atypical ductal hyperplasia as well as in
normal tissues adjacent to tumors, then increases markedly to

high and very high levels in DCIS and IBC, respectively.
Facilitation of HIF1 activity by RHBDF1 may explain the close
correlation of high RHBDF1 protein levels with lymph node
and distant metastasis of the cancer cells, local recurrence, and
poorer overall and disease-free patient survival.
Hypoxia-associated drug resistance is a major clinical issue.
Consistent with RHBDF1-facilitation of HIF1 activity, we found
that patients with low RHBDF1 protein levels responded better
to the new adjuvant chemotherapy regimen. Because HIF1

resistance to apoptosis-inducing chemotherapies. In this
regard, our study has demonstrated that by using the peptide
mimic VR56, we may intervene RHBDF1-facilitated stabilization of HIF1a by inhibiting RHBDF1 tyrosine phosphorylation.
This suggests that RHBDF1 may serve as a target for cancer
drug development.

Stabilization of HIF1a by RHBDF1 in Cancer

Figure 7. A schematic representation of a hypothesized mechanism of RHBDF1-facilitated HIF1a stabilization.

It is of interest that noncatalytic rhomboids, such as human
RHBDF1, may function as regulatory proteins. Noncatalytic
rhomboids are considered to have evolved from rhomboid
proteases that lost their catalytic activity but retained their
location in the protein synthesis apparatus (10), and plausibly
maintained their abilities to bind to what were once their
substrates. New functions as regulatory proteins may be
acquired by taking advantages of the expression pattern,
subcellular location, and substrate-binding capacity. Consistent with this notion is the wide range of inactive cognates of
many enzymes (28). That RHBDF1 may have evolved from a
membrane-bound protease into a regulatory protein may
exemplify this evolutionary route.
In summary, our experimental data are consistent with the
view that RHBDF1, RACK1, and HSP90 form a "molecular
switch" that controls oxygen-independent degradation of
HIF1a. In this mechanism, RHBDF1 facilitates HIF1a stability
by preventing RACK1 binding to HIF1a, thus attenuating
ubiquitin-mediated HIF1a proteasomal degradation and shifting HIF1a binding toward HSP90. RHBDF1 is therefore an
essential component of cell survival mechanism underlying
cellular responses to oxygen deﬁciency. In addition, our ﬁndings illustrate that intervention of RHBDF1 activity by gene
silencing or by speciﬁc inhibition of tyrosine phosphorylation
of the RHBDF1 protein presents a potentially new approach to
develop anticancer therapeutics.
