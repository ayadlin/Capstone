Abstract

Materials and Methods

A long-standing but poorly understood observation in
experimental cancer therapy is the heterogeneity in cancer
susceptibility to energy deprivation. Here, we show that the
hexose kinase inhibitor 2-deoxyglucose (2-dG) preferentially
kills cancer cells with defective laforin expression and
significantly increases the survival of mice with aggressive
lymphoma due to a genetic defect of the laforin-encoding
Epm2a gene. Normal cells from Epm2a / mice also had
greatly increased susceptibility to 2-dG. Thus, laforin is a
novel regulator for cellular response to energy deprivation
and its defects in cancer cells may be targeted for cancer
therapy. [Cancer Res 2008;68(11):4039–44]

Antibodies and reagents. Antibodies against the following proteins
were used in this study: anti-Akt, phospho-Akt (Ser473), phospho-GSK3h
(Ser9), phospho-AMPK, phospho-S6K70 (Thr389), phospho-mTOR, and
caspase-3 (Cell Signaling); anti-V5 and anti-Myc (Invitrogen Corp.); and
anti-h-actin (I-19), TSC2, hexokinase, S6K, and VDAC (Santa Cruz
Biotechnology, Inc.). Anti-laforin polyclonal antibody was produced by
Genemed Synthesis, Inc. Rabbits were immunized with the synthetic
peptide of 16 amino acid residues (YKFLQREPGGELHWEG, residues 85–100
in laforin protein, accession no. AAD26336) coupled with keyhole limpet
hemocyanin in complete Freund’s adjuvant. The antiserum was purified
using peptide-conjugated Affigel column.
Plasmids and transfection. Full-length cDNA of Epm2a was amplified
by reverse-transcription PCR using high-fidelity Taq enzyme (Invitrogen)
from mouse spleen and cloned into vectors of pcDNA4-V5/His (Invitrogen)
at restriction enzyme sites of HindIII/BamHI to get fusion proteins with
Myc or V5 tag fused in the C terminus of laforin. Human embryonic kidney
HEK293 cells were transiently transfected or cotransfected with different
expression plasmids for 24 h under a culture of Opti-MEM medium
containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and the premixed mixture of the
plasmids with Lipofectamine 2000 that was done according to the vendor
protocol (Invitrogen).
Epm2a small interfering RNA constructs. Oligonucleotides encoding
small interfering RNA (siRNA) directed against Epm2a at COOH-terminal
region of 934 to 954 nucleotides (5¶-AAGGTGCAGTACTTCATCATG-3¶) were
inserted into a modified pLenti6/V5-D-TOPO vector (Invitrogen). Lentivirus
stocks were produced in 293FT cells according to the manufacturer’s
protocol. Viral-transduced cells were selected with blasticidin.
MTT cell viability assay. One hundred microliters of cells (1  103 per
mL) were plated out in triplicate into wells of a 96-well microplate,
including three control wells of medium alone, to provide the blanks for
absorbance readings. The cells were incubated under conditions appropriate for the cell line for 12 h and treated with different concentration of
2-deoxyglucose (2-dG, Sigma). Ten microliters of 5 mg/mL 3-(4,5Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT; Sigma) in
PBS were added to each well, including controls. Plates were returned to
cell culture incubator for 2 to 4 h. When the purple precipitate is clearly
visible under the microscope, the cultures were removed from incubator
and the resulting MTT formazan crystals were dissolved by adding 150 AL
DMSO. Absorbance was spectrophotometrically measured at a wavelength
of 490 nm.
Propidium iodide staining. 2-dG–treated or control cells were stained
by propidium iodide (PI) using ‘‘PI/RNase Staining Buffer’’ from BD
Biosciences according to product instruction. Briefly, cells were frozen in
70% ethanol overnight and washed with PBS thrice, and 0.5 mL staining
buffer was added to each sample cells. The content of DNA in stained cells
was determined by flow cytometry after 15-min room temperature
incubation.

Introduction
An important hallmark of many poorly differentiated and rapidly
growing malignant tumors is higher rates of glucose usage and
glycolysis compared with corresponding normal tissues (1, 2).
Increase in glucose uptake is the earliest change observed in cells
after malignant transformation (3, 4). The abnormalities in energy
metabolism of cancer cells have been targeted for cancer therapy
with mixed success (5–8). The heterogeneity of cancer cell response
to energy deprivation suggests that additional modifiers exist. As
such, understanding the mechanism for cellular energy response
may offer critical insights for cancer therapy. It is established that
energy deprivation results in activation of AMP-activated protein
kinase (AMPK), which in conjunction with glycogen synthase
kinase 3h (GSK3h) activates the tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC)
pathway to inhibit mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR).
Genetic defects of this pathway render cancer cells more
susceptible to energy deprivation (9, 10).
Laforin is a dual-specific phosphatase encoded by Epm2a, which
was initially identified as one of the causative genes for progressive
myoclonus epilepsy (11). Its known substrates include GSK3h
(12, 13) and carbohydrates (14). Recently, an elegant genetic study
showed that laforin complements starch excess 4 mutations in the
Arabidopsis thaliana (15). In immune compromised mice, Epm2a
works as a tumor suppressor gene (13). It is unclear, however,
whether laforin is involved in cellular response to energy
deprivation. Here, we showed that laforin is a novel regulator for
cellular response to energy deprivation and its defects in cancer
cells may be targeted for cancer therapy.

Results and Discussion
In analyzing laforin expression among cancer cell lines, we found
great heterogeneity of its expression. For example, among four
murine tumor cell lines tested, MC38 had a high level of laforin

Laforin and Resistance to Apoptosis

expression, whereas the lymphoma cell line TGB had no detectable
laforin, and the remaining cell lines had low to intermediate levels
(Fig. 1A). Given the function of laforin in regulating GSK3h activity
and the role for GSK3h in the cellular response to energy, we
compared these cell lines for their susceptibility to 2-dG treatment.
Whereas the TGB lymphoma cells underwent extensive apoptosis,
as judged by the percentage of cells with less than 2C DNA
contents in response to 2-dG treatment, MC38 cells were largely
resistant (Fig. 1B, top). When a panel of tumor cell lines expressing
different levels of laforin were subjected to the same treatment, we
observed a strong inverse correlation between the laforin levels and
the percentage of apoptotic cells (Fig. 1B, bottom).
To directly show the protective effect of laforin to energy
deprivation–induced apoptosis, we generated a Tet-off system
in the EL4, a mouse T lymphoma cell line with low levels of
endogenous laforin (13). As shown in Fig. 1C, removal of
doxycycline resulted in a significant induction of the transfected
laforin, regardless of the 2-dG in the medium. With the induction
of laforin expression, the EL4 cells gained resistance to 2-dG
treatment, as revealed by both activation of caspase-3 and the
percentage of cells with sub-2C DNA contents (Fig. 1C). Thus,
expression of laforin conveyed resistance to 2-dG.
An important issue is whether laforin is required for resistance of
normal cells to 2-dG. To address this issue, we compared the
sensitivity of T cells from wild-type (WT) and laforin-deficient mice
for their sensitivity to 2-dG. As shown in Fig. 2, targeted mutation
of the Epm2a gene drastically increased the sensitivity of the
splenic T cells to 2-dG, as revealed by cellular viability (MTT assay;

Fig. 2A) and DNA content (Fig. 2B). Taken together, our data
showed that laforin plays a critical role in protecting cells from
apoptosis induced by energy deprivation.
The AMPK-GSK3h-TSC-mTOR pathway plays an important role
in regulating cellular energy response (9, 10). As a genetic test, we
compared the effect of laforin knockdown in TSC2-deficient and
TSC2-reconstituted EEF8 cells (Fig. 3A; refs. 9, 10). siRNA silencing
of Epm2a significantly increased GSK3h phosphorylation, with the
notable exception of 50 mmol/L 2-dG treatment when the cell
viability was poor. This, however, did not appreciably affect mTOR
activation as revealed by comparable levels of S6K P70 phosphorylation at the Thr389 site. As expected, activation of AMPK was also
unaffected (Fig. 3B). Nevertheless, laforin knockdown did increase
cellular susceptibility to 2-dG regardless of TSC2 expression (Fig. 3C
and D). Thus, the laforin works independently of the TSC-mTOR
pathway in regulating cellular response to energy deprivation.
The fact that a large proportion of both mouse and human
lymphomas have depressed laforin expression (13) and that cells
with defective laforin have increased susceptibility to energy
deprivation suggests that 2-dG may be effective in treating this type
of cancer. We reported that insertional mutation of one allele of the
Epm2a gene in conjunction with epigenetic silencing caused
lymphoma with rapid onset and 100% lethality within 1 year (13).
This model allowed us to determine if energy deprivation can be
therapeutic for lymphoma. Thus, we treated the TGB mice with
2-dG and followed the survival of the mice. As shown in Fig. 4A,
regardless of the age of treatment, at either 8 to 12 weeks when
some untreated mice had begun to become moribund, or at

Figure 2. Targeted mutation of the Epm2a gene dramatically increases susceptibility of normal T cells. Spleen cells from the WT and Epm2a / mice (17) were
stimulated with anti-CD3 (400 ng/mL) for 48 h. After washing with culture medium, the cells were cultured in the presence of given concentration of 2-dG for 24 h.
The survival of T cells was determined either by MTT assay (A) using the absorbance of the untreated group as 100% or by DNA contents (B ). A, points, mean
of triplicates, T cells from two mice per group; bars, SD. These experiments have been repeated twice.

15 to 20 weeks of age when 25% to 50% of untreated mice had
succumbed to cancer, 2-dG significantly prolonged mouse survival.
As we have reported previously (13), human lymphoma cell lines
were heterogenous in laforin levels. This feature allowed us to
determine whether laforin levels predict cancer susceptibility to

2-dG treatment. As shown in Fig. 4B, when a panel of eight
lymphomas was tested, those with no or the lowest levels of laforin
were significantly more susceptible to 2-dG treatment compared
with cells displaying high levels of laforin. Notably, among the
six lines with high levels of laforin and relatively more resistant to

and TSC2 siRNA transfectants were treated with given concentration of 2-dG for 0.5 h. The cell lysates were harvested and probed with antibodies specific for
phosphorylated AMPK (P-AMPK ; Thr172), S6K70 (P-S6K70 ; Thr389), and GSK3h (P-GSK3b; Ser9) or total S6K and laforin. Data shown have been repeated four times.

glucose + 10% dialyzed FBS [G( )]; DMEM + 1 g/L glucose (no FBS; -); and DMEM + 1 g/L glucose + 2-dG (no FBS; 2-dG). Data have been repeated thrice.

Laforin and Resistance to Apoptosis

Figure 4. Laforin expression and cancer
susceptibility to energy deprivation.
A, 2-dG treatment significantly increases
the life span of the TGB mice that develop
lymphoma due to genetic and epigenetic
defects of the Epm2a gene. TGB mice
were grouped and paired according to age
and treated with either PBS or 2-dG at
the dose of 20 mg/mouse/3 d at the
beginning week and then 20 mg/mouse/
week in the following 1 mo until moribund
or death. Data shown indicate the life span
after initiation of treatment. B, inverse
correlation between laforin levels and
cellular response to 2-dG treatment. Top,
levels of laforin as determined by Western
blot using total S6K as a loading control;
bottom, percentage of cells with less than
2C DNA contents as determined by flow
cytometry. Columns, mean; bars, SD.
Data have been repeated twice.

2-dG, there is no strict correlation between laforin levels and
susceptibility to 2-dG. These data are best explained by involvement of other factors that may regulate cellular energy response
(9, 10).
Taken together, we have shown laforin as a critical checkpoint
for cellular susceptibility to energy deprivation–induced apoptosis
and that laforin regulates cell survival under energy deprivation
by a TSC-independent mechanism. Because down-regulation of
laforin is quite widespread in human lymphoma (13), and because
the human chromosome 6q24, where Epm2a resides, is often
deleted in human cancer (16), targeting this defect may have a
significant effect for cancer therapy.
