ABSTRACT
Glioblastoma multiform (GBM) is one of the most lethal human malignant brain
tumors with high risks of recurrence and poor treatment outcomes. The RNA-binding
protein Musashi-1 (MSI1) is a marker of neural stem/progenitor cells. Recent study
showed that high expression level of MSI1 positively correlates with advanced grade
of GBM, where MSI1 increases the growth of GBM. Herein, we explore the roles of
MSI1 as well as the underlying mechanisms in the regulation of drug resistance and
tumorigenesis of GBM cells. Our results demonstrated that overexpression of MSI1
effectively protected GBM cells from drug-induced apoptosis through down-regulating
pro-apoptotic genes; whereas inhibition of AKT withdrew the MSI1-induced antiapoptosis and cell survival. We further showed that MSI1 robustly promoted the
secretion of the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-6, which was governed by AKT activity.
Autonomously, the secreted IL-6 enhanced AKT activity in an autocrine/paracrine
manner, forming a positive feedback regulatory loop with the MSI1-AKT pathway. Our
results conclusively demonstrated a novel drug resistance mechanism in GBM cells
that MSI1 inhibits drug-induced apoptosis through AKT/IL6 regulatory circuit. MSI1
regulates both cellular signaling and tumor-microenvironmental cytokine secretion
to create an intra- and intercellular niche for GBM to survive from chemo-drug attack.

chemotherapy or radiotherapy is presently the general
guideline of GBM in curative intent; however, therapeutic
resistance and recurrence are still a unsolved conundrum
[4]. Consequently, GBM cases have a median survival
of approximately 15 months. Therefore, understanding
the key mechanism involved in drug and therapeutic
resistance is of critical in searching novel effective GBM
treating strategy.

INTRODUCTION
Brain tumors, according to World Health
Organization (WHO), can be categorized into four grades
from I to IV [1]. Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM),
graded IV, is one of the most frequent and aggressive
human primary brain tumors [2], which remain highly
undifferentiated [3]. Surgical dissection combining

the aim of this study was to draw the detail mechanism
of MSI1 in regulating chemo-resistance and to determine
whether MSI1 affects apoptotic events through IL-6
regulatory circuit. Indeed, our results indicated that MSI1
activates AKT with phosphorylation and further induces
IL-6 biogenesis and secretion while drug is encountered.
Inhibition of AKT activation in MSI1-overexpressed
cells greatly reduced the autocrinal/paracrinal IL-6 and
increased in the number of apoptotic cells upon chemodrug stimulation. In this study, we revealed MSI1 plays
an important role in AKT activation and IL-6 secretion
in response to chemo-drug in GBM cells, which
eventually contributes to a dynamic interaction between
proinflammatory circuits, chemoresistance, and tumor
recurrence.

Musashi-1(MSI1) is one of neural stem cell
marker that is highly expressed in the central nervous
system. The primary structure and the expression
pattern of MSI1 have been recognized among species
in nematodes, Drosophila as well as ascidian [2]. In
mammalian, MSI1 is believed to be a marker of neural
stem cells and progenitor cells. Okano et al. firstly
proved that MSI1 has multiple functions in regulating
cell fate decision and maintaining the stem cell state
[5]. Additionally, highly expressed MSI1 are associated
with high-grade glioma; as a result, the prognostic
potential of MSI1 has been approved by survival
analysis [6]. Moreover, knockdown of MSI1 was found
to promote tumor regression and radiation-induced
colon cancer cells apoptosis, indicating that MSI1 plays
important roles in cancer cell proliferation, inhibition
of apoptosis and modulating of tumor progression [7].
The underlying mechanism had been implied by the
MSI1-mediated inhibition of Numb and the downstream
activation of PI3K/AKT pathway in glioma cells [8].
Although several functional aspects of MSI1 have
been characterized, there are still many issues in the
molecular mechanism, especially the role in tumor
resistance and tumor pathogenicity, remain questioned.
AKT, also known as protein kinase B, is a serine/
threonine protein kinase that plays a critical role in cell
growths, cell survival, apoptosis, and tumor progression
by activating a series of different downstream signaling
pathways [9]. In some tumor, constitutively activated
AKT is associated with increased drug resistance and cell
survival [10]. A variety of AKT inhibitor have been shown
to prevent tumor cell growth and induce apoptosis both
in vitro and in vivo [11]. The pathway leading to AKT
activation involves receptor tyrosine kinase including
PI3K (phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase) [12]. Many pattern
recognition receptors, growth factor receptors and
cytokine receptors are able to activate PI3K, and thereby
activate AKT [13]. Recently studies have shown that the
AKT signaling is involved in regulating the inflammatory
response and modulating of cancer cell development and
anti-apoptosis [14].
Inflammatory cytokines have been found as
critical mediator in GBM microenvironment, which
predominantly regulate tumor growth, metastasis, and
drug resistance [15]. Among the well-characterized
cytokines, interleukin-6 (IL-6) is one of the important
inflammatory factors which regulates cell proliferation
and anti-apoptosis [16]. Previous studies that IL-6 are
reported to overexpress in breast, liver, colon and brain
tumor. Moreover, IL-6 activates several pro-proliferation
and survival proteins in order to stimulate tumor cell
growth [17]; whereas, the inhibition of IL-6 signaling
was shown to reduce both glioma size and aggressiveness
[18]. For instance, IL-6-induced PI3K/AKT activation
was essential for anti-apoptotic signaling cascade, which
has long be linked to therapeutic resistance [19]. Thus,

RESULTS
Musashi-1 regulated in vitro tumorigenic ability
of GBM to resist chemodrug-induced cell death
Accumulated reports have indicated that MSI1
is able to promote drug resistance and cell survival
through various signaling pathways in glioma [8,
14–16], but the downstream regulators still remain
debating. To address the role of MSI1 on drug resistance
in GBM cells, we initially evaluated the cell viability
in 05MG GBM cell line with either over-expressed or
knockdown MSI1 expression in the presence or absence
of chemotherapeutic agents. Cells was treated with
cisplatin (DDP) in various concentration for 24 hrs;
MTT assay was performed to observed cell viability.
The OD570 values showed no significant difference
on cell survival rate between Flag-control and MSI1overexpressed cells; while 50 μM DDP led to around
35% cell death in Flag-control cells but only 15%
cell death in MSI1-overexpressed cells (Figure 1A).
Consistently, this effect was conversely displayed in
MSI1-knockdown cells, where 50 μM DDP led to 50%
cell death in MSI1-knockdown cell but only 30% in
parental cells (Figure 1B). The same result was also
observed with ATO treatment (Suppl. Figure 1A and
Suppl. Figure 1B), suggesting that MSI1 prevents GBM
cells from chemotherapy-induced cells death. Next to
evaluate whether MSI1 promotes cells survival during
DDP treatment in GBM cells, the colony formation assay
with a dose-course treatment of DDP was performed
(Figure 1C-1E). As expected, treatment of 50 μM DDP
on Flag-control cells yielded a surviving fraction of
50%; while the same treatment on MSI1-overexpressed
cells led to a surviving fraction of 70% (Figure 1C). On
the other hand, parental cells showed 50% surviving
fraction under 50 μM DDP treatment, while MSI1knocked cells showed only 30% (Figure 1D). The
same result was also observed with ATO treatment

Musashi-1 enhanced chemoresistance of GBM
cells through repressing apoptotic pathway

(Suppl. Figure 1C-1E). These data suggested that MSI1
promotes cells survival under chemodrug-mediated cell
dysfunction. According to our finding, MSI1 enhanced
cell survival and preserved the tumorigenesis capability
upon chemodrugs treatment in GBM cells. Musashi-1
enhanced chemoresistance of GBM cells through
repressing apoptotic pathway.

It has been reported that MSI1 could regulate druginduced apoptosis via several signaling cascade [17–19].
To further explore the underlying mechanism of MSI1dependent anti-apoptotic pathway, we performed assays,

including AnnexinV, TUNEL and active caspase-3 for
evaluating the apoptotic events in drug treated GBM cells.
As shown in Figure 2A, the AnnexinV-positive signals
in Flag-control cells was similar to MSI1-overexpressed
cells in normal condition. 50 μM DDP leaded about 18.5%
AnnexinV-positive cells in Flag-control cells death, however
only caused 11.5% cell death in MSI1-ovexpressed cells.
Moreover, TUNEL was used to investigate DDP-facilitate
DNA damage, as show in Figure 2C, 50 μM DDP leaded
about 28.5% TUNEL-positive cells in Flag-control cells
death, but only caused 17.5% TUNEL-positive cells in MSI1-

ovexpressed cells. Science cleaved caspase-3 is known to play
vital roles to modulated cell apoptosis pathway, therefore we
also investigated the caspase-3 positive cells. In Figure 2E,
50 μM DDP leaded about 25% cleaved caspase-3 positive
cells in Flag-control cells death, however only caused 10.5%
cleaved caspase-3 positive cells in MSI1-ovexpressed cells.
Remarkably, the anti-apoptotic effect was withdrawn by the
suppression of MSI1 expression (Figure 2B, 2D, 2F). Not
only DDP but ATO-induced apoptosis could be eliminated
by the overexpression of MSI1 (Suppl. Figure 2), suggesting
that MSI1-preferentially leads to an anti-apoptotic fashion

(PI3K inhibitor) and analyzed the protein levels of
active caspase-3 and cleaved-PARP by Western blot.
Compared with Flag-control GBM cells, DDP-induced
expression of active caspase-3 and cleaved-PARP were
significantly decreased in MSI1-overexpressed GBM cells.
Interestingly, the addition of LY294002 partly restored the
expression of active caspase-3 and cleaved-PARP under
DDP treatment in MSI1-overexpressed GBM cells (Figure
4A-4C). Similar results were also obtained by ATO
treatment (Suppl. Figure 5A-5C), suggesting activated
AKT is essential for MSI1-dependent suppression of
PARP and Caspase-3 activity.
Next, we assessed the percentage of apoptotic
cells by the ratio of AnnexinV/PI, TUNEL/PI, and active
caspase-3/PI with flow cytometry. As show in Figure 4D
to 4H and Suppl. Figure 4, both DDP and ATO induced
apoptosis in parental GBM cells; compared with the
Flag-control cells (20% AnnexinV-positive cells, 18.5%
TUNEL-positive cells and 22% cleaved casapase-3
positive cells), chemodrug-induced apoptosis was
significantly decreased in MSI1-overexpressed GBM
cells (11% AnnexinV-positive cells, 10% TUNELpositive cells and 14% cleaved casapase-3 positive cells).
Interestingly, under DDP or ATO treatment, inhibition of
AKT by LY294002 elevated the percentage of apoptosis in
MSI1-overexpressed cells (17% AnnexinV-positive cells,
12.5% TUNEL-positive cells and 20% cleaved casapase-3
positive cells), compared with that in MSI1-overexpressed
cells without LY294002 treatment (Figure 4D-4H; Suppl.
Figure 4D-4F). These data implied that activated AKT
mediates MSI1-dependent induction of chemoresistance in
GBM cells, and that inhibition of AKT activity sensitizes
GBM cells to chemotherapeutic treatment.

in response to chemotherapeutic drugs in GBM cells. Based
on our data in Figure 1 and Figure 2, MSI1 inhibited DDPinduced cell apoptosis, including reduced pro-apoptosis
protein expression, attenuates AnnexinV positive cells,
and decreased TUNEL positive cells. Moreover, the MSI1dependent enhancement of cell survival did not involve
enhanced proliferation rate (Figure 2). Most importantly,
all of the MSI1-dependent anti-apoptotic effects were only
shown under DDP treatment. To further elucidate the potential
pathways and factors involved in MSI1 mitigated chemodruginduced apoptosis, we used Ingenuity Pathway Analysis
(IPA, Qiagen Inc.) as a bioinformatic platform to identify the
possible network shared between MSI1 and other apoptosisrelated candidates. As shown in Figure 2G, MSI1 and AKT
were found to jointly decrease apoptosis as well as survival
regulatory network. Regarding that AKT was reported to
activate BAD and prevents caspase-3 from cleaving [20],
we thereby illustrated the potential regulatory trend between
MSI1 and AKT activation in response to chemotherapy.

Musashi-1 regulated AKT activation to mitigate
drug-induced apoptosis
A recent report has indicated that MSI1 is capable
of enhancing the growth and/or survival of glioma cells
through Notch and PI3K/AKT signaling pathway [8].
However, whether MSI1 involves in AKT-dependent
apoptotic pathway is still an open question. Hence, we
turned our attention to test whether MSI1 predominantly
activates AKT during drug treatment. Immunoblot
revealed that AKT was enhanced by two phosphorylation
sites (Thr308 and Ser473) of which MSI1-overexpressed
GBM cells were significantly sensitive than that of Flagcontrol cells in a dose-dependent manner (Figure 3A
and 3B). Overexpression of MSI1 suppressed the DDPinduced activation of PARP and Caspase-3 (Figure 3C
and 3D). Similarly, in the case of ATO treatment, ectopic
expression of MSI1 also increased AKT phosphorylation
at the two sites and decreased the activation of both
PARP and Caspase-3 (Suppl. Figure 3), indicating that
MSI1 overexpression was capable of engagement against
cytotoxic stress. Consistently, knockdown of MSI1 by
siRNA resulted in suppressed AKT phosphorylation and
increased PARP and Caspase-3 activity in GBM cells, in
comparison to the control (Figure 3E-3H). As a result,
significant lower level of cleaved caspase-3 and PARP
in response to chemotherapy in MSI1-overexpressed
GBM cells have drawn a potential regulatory relationship
between MSI1 and AKT as well as the apoptosis signaling.
Inhibition of AKT-phosphorylation blocks MSI1-induced
chemoresistance in GBM cells.
Since previous reports have indicated the crucial
role of active AKT in promoting drug resistance and
apoptosis pathway [12, 20, 21], we further studied if AKT
activation is essential in MSI1-induced chemoresistance.
We inhibited AKT phosphorylation by LY294002

Autocrine/paracrine biogenesis was enriched in
DDP-treated GBM cells via a Musashi-1/AKT
signaling cascade
Elevated evidences have demonstrated the
dominant role of pro-inflammatory circuits and tumormicroenvironment interaction within tumorigenicity,
drug resistance, and tumor recurrences [22–25]. Several
secreted factors, including tumor-associated inflammatory
cytokines were shown to regulate autocrine/paracrine
signaling in mediating the malignant transformation
of tumor cells including chemoresistance [26–28]. To
explore the potential targets involving in MSI1-driven
tumor-resistance in malignant glioma, we sought to
in silico analyze the global gene expression profile to
explore the impact of MSI1 overexpression in GBM cells.
Comparing MSI1-overexpressing cells with Flag-control
cells, we screened out the expression level lower than
1.5 log2 ratio (subtotal 989 genes, of which 564 genes
were up-regulated and 425 genes were down-regulated)
and subjected to DAVID bioinformatics resource (https://
david.ncifcrf.gov/summary.jsp) and REVIGO (http://

enrichment analysis. Furthermore, using BenjaminiHochberg procedure, the immune inflammatory response
and pro-inflammatory cytokines-related pathways,
including CCL2, CCL3, CCL4, CXCR4, CXCR12, IL2,
IL-6, IL-7, IL17, IL23, and cIAP2, were found highly
expressed in our results. The annotated gene sets were
identified with the lowest false discovery rate (FDR)
(Figure 5A). Moreover, the GO: biological processes
accession, name, and the corresponding p-value (Fisher
extract test) were clustered together in superclusters of

related terms (Figure 5B), suggesting the importance of
pro-inflammatory events in MSI1-modulated GBM cells.
Among the genes highlighted, we found the DDP-induced
mRNA level of IL-6, IL-7, IL-17, cIAP2, CXCR4 and
CXCL12 were highly enriched while MSI1 up-regulated
(Figure 5C-5H). Furthermore, the inactivation of AKT
partly withdrew the enrichment, of which IL-6 showed
the most significant change in response to LY294002
(Figure 5C-5H). Therefore, these results indicated that the
biogenesis of IL-6 could lead to activation of AKT under
chemotherapeutic stress.

the AKT/PI3K pathway in contribution to cancer cell

uncertain. Since we have demonstrated the increase of
IL-6 biogenesis in MSI1-overexpressed cells with DDP
treatment, secretory IL-6 level also elevated in consistence
to mRNA expression using ELISA examination (Figure
6A). Concurrently, the exogenous IL-6 induced the

MSI1-overexpressed GBM cells while anti- IL-6 could
effectively neutralize the effect (Figure 6E-6G). According
to our data, the condition medium from DDP-treated cells
did activate AKT phosphorylation in the recipient cells;
moreover, anti-IL-6 neutralizing agents impaired the
DDP-induced AKT phosphorylation, indicating that IL-6
signaling cascade acts as a leading role in an autocrine/
paracrine fashion. Coherently, the autocrinal/paracrinal
IL-6 was found to cooperate with AKT in elevating
anti-apoptotic events (Figure 6H-6J). Collectively, our
data illustrated the autocrinal/paracrinal anti-apoptotic
circuit that MSI1 activates AKT for IL-6 biogenesis and

secretion, which in turn, autonomously activates AKT at
Ser473 phosphorylation.

GBM cells in Figure 1. The in vivo effects of MSI1 in
chemoresistance and autocrinal/paracrinal status, however,
still remain an open question. We therefore subcutaneously
inoculated the Flag-control cells or MSI1-overexpressed
GBM cells in nude mice and treated them with vehicle
of DDP (10 mg/kg intraperitoneally) to determine if our
findings were interpretable from in vitro to in vivo study.
DDP modestly, but significantly promoted tumor growth
at 8 days after the first drug exposure (Figure 7A and 7C;
P<0.05). The effect become more apparent after 24 days
(Figure 7A and 7C; P<0.01). No statistically significant
changes in body weight were noted between the control
and DPP-treated mice (Figure 7B). These data suggested
that the overexpression of MSI1 overturned the killing
effect of DDP and promoted the growth of tumor.
To further evaluate the levels of microenvironmental
IL-6 and cellular active PARP and Caspase-3, we
performed immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining of tumor
tissues. Consistent to our in vitro results, overexpression
of MSI1 in GBM enormously increase the infiltration
of pro-inflammatory factor IL-6 throughout the tissue
section (Figure 7D). Besides, the pro-apoptotic proteins,
including caspase3 and PARP, were decreased in the
DDP-treated 05MG-FlagMSI1 xenograft tumors,
indicated the chemoresistance in MSI1-overexpressed
GBM tissue (Figure 7D). In addition to IHC, we extracted
the proteins from four individual mice in each group,
demonstrating the synchronous pattern between IL-6
level and AKT phosphorylation (Figure 7E). Taken
together, we collectively address the possible regulatory
circuit that AKT activation takes reciprocal action to IL-6
biogenesis and secretion, while MSI1 plays a dominant
role in initiating this anti-apoptotic process (Figure 7F).
To address the autocrinal/paracrinal fashion in IL-6mediated MSI1-tumorigenesis in vivo, we subcutaneously
inoculated the MSI1-overexpressed cells in nude mice
and treated them in the absence or presence of IL-6
neutralizing antibody (0.15μg/ml, i.p.). As shown in
Figure 7G, DDP promoted tumor growth at the 10th day
after the first DDP administration, but was then retarded
by IL-6 neutralizing antibody treatment at the 14th day.
Our data also suggested that overexpressed MSI1 induced
IL-6 secretion and promoted tumor growth, nevertheless,
ablation of IL-6 by the neutralizing antibody withdrawn
the malignant phenotypes. These findings confirmed the
MSI1-dependent suppression of apoptosis and induction
of chemoresistance, as well as the MSI1-induced AKT
activation and IL-6 autocrine/paracrine secretion in GBM
tumor in vivo.

and considered as an essential marker for neural stem cells
or progenitor cells, accumulated studies have indicated
MSI1 enriches the population of cancer stem cells [2, 37,
38]. For instance, Sureban et al. reported the correlation
between MSI1 and radio-resistance in human colon
cancer cells [7]. Besides, MSI1 is known for functioning
as translation regulators from targeting mRNAs and is
critical in maintenance of stemness and self-renewal
capability [39, 40]; meanwhile, the correlation between
highly expressed MSI1 and tumor malignancies has been
verified in breast cancer, endometrial carcinoma and
adenocarcinoma [41–43]. Although MSI1 expression
has been hinted as a prognosis factor in various cancers
[44–46], the underlying mechanism involved in drug
resistance is still an open question. Here, we address
that MSI1 protect tumor cells from drug-induced
apoptosis and promote tumor growth. Blockade of AKT
phosphorylation by LY294002, a PI3K inhibitor, greatly
relieved the activation of caspase-3 and PARP signaling
in MSI1-overexpressed GBM cells. In fact, MSI1 secures
the cells from apoptotic process, and in part, increases the
growth of cancer cells and clonogenic ability. Global gene
expression array indicated that MSI1 post-translationally
activates AKT through PI3K-dependent phosphorylation,
which triggers the survival signaling in the downstream
and vice versa.
AKT signaling pathway has long been a wellstudied cell-fate pathway regulating the apoptosis
and survival genes, including ERK, BAD, Forkhead,
etc. However, little is known about the regulation
between MSI1 and AKT, despite Muto et al. reported
that MSI1 knockdown reduced the activity of AktPI3K and NOTCH pathway in response to the directly
posttranscriptional regulation of Numb and PTEN
[8]. AKT contains two phosphorylation sites that
are in favor of different kinases, where serine 473
(Ser473) and threonine 308 (Thr308) are targeted by
mTORC2 and 3-phosphoinositide dependent kinase
1 (PDK1), respectively [20]. Although some reports
indicated that Thr308 retains more reliability than
Ser473 of being a prognostic factor in non-small cell
lung cancer and leukemia [47, 48], Ser473 is likely
to perform more contribution in cellular survival
regulation [49, 50]. Therefore, we coordinately
examined the two phosphorylation sties in response to
chemodrugs with MSI1 modulation. We demonstrate
that MSI1 dominantly activates AKT through Ser473
phosphorylation than that of Thr308, suggesting direct
correlation between MSI1 and Ser473 controls druginduced apoptosis, which acts as a protective mechanism
in stressful cells. However, how the phosphorylation
of AKT is regulated by MSI1 is still remain mystery.
In order to dissect the putative regulatory path, we

other, our solid evidence demonstrates the paracrinal
effect of DDP-treated GBM cells but the autocrinal
effect is unable to be ruled out from our results.
Regarding the previous studies, the IL-6 regulatory
circuit can be jointly categorized as autocrine/paracrine
rather than an individual one [63–67]. Additionally,
AKT is previously reported to play positive role in
regulating IL-6 biogenesis and secretion by NF-kB and
MAPK pathway, supporting the notion that AKT may
upstream modulator in IL-6 pro-inflammatory pathway
[61, 62]. Recently, IL-6 is reported to play a positive
role in regulating AKT/PI3K activity to promote tumor
cell survival [68]. Direct correlation between IL6,
AKT and NF-kB reduced increased tumor growth and
metastasis in mouse xenografts since IL-6 feedback
loop, which is also validated as a protective mechanism
in cells under stress condition [32]. Our in vitro results
indicated a regulatory circuit between AKT and IL-6,
in which autocrinal/paracrinal IL-6 increased AKT
activity while phosphorylated AKT enhanced IL-6
secretion to the microenvironment. This circuit resulted
in suppressed apoptotic molecules such as cleaved
PARP and Caspase-3. Similarly, our in vivo results also
indicated the infiltrated expression of IL-6 throughout
the sectioned tumor tissue, emphasizing the potential
autocrinal/paracrinal regulation. Therefore, the results
inspired us to retreat the drug resistance through antiIL-6 therapy on the basis of both epigenetic modulation
and our displayed results of MSI1-induced AKT-IL-6
autonomous regulatory circuit.
Taken together, our study indicates the autonomous
MSI1-dependent regulation of AKT and IL-6 in GBM,
and partly answered the unsolved question of how MSI1
takes effect on autocrine/paracrine secretion, as well
as tumor environmental pro-inflammatory biogenesis.
Further studies may be required to investigate the
aberrant mechanism of AKT and IL-6 in contribution to
other chemotherapeutic agents as well as radiotherapy.
These findings could be of valuable in applying antiIL-6 to withdraw the drug resistance of cancer cells
clinically.

conducted a systemic overview on our microarray
results, and identified that TNS2 mRNA was decreased
in MSI1 overexpressed cells (data not show). TNS2
inhibits AKT/PKB signaling via C1-TEN (C1 domaincontaining phosphatase and TENsin homologue) and
mediates TPO (Thrombopoietin)/c-Mpl pathway [51],
which engages AKT signaling in induction of cancer
growth [52]. Thus, we imply that MSI1 is responsible
for modulating AKT phosphorylation through multiple
indirect ways, including posttranscriptional downregulation of Numb/PTEN and TNS2, and eventually
achieve the survival of cancer cells under chemotherapy.
Moreover, our microarray data additionally suggested
that the pro-inflammatory related gene clusters were
highly enriched, which may as well attribute the
microenvironment for GBM cells to not only maintain
the self-renewal stemness but also the differentiating
plasticity. For instance, Leibovich-Rivkin et al.
displayed that the pro-inflammatory microenvironment
despite induce the malignant transformation of normal
breast epithelial cells, those secreted cytokines also
provide an excellent scaffold for circulating cancer cells
to be seeded and migrated [53].
Interleukin-6 (IL-6), a pro-inflammatory cytokines
in host defense against inflammation and tissue injury,
has been linked to tumorigenesis, angiogenesis, and
survival in malignant tumors like GBM [29]. The role
of IL-6 as critical mediator for tumor growth, metastasis,
and drug resistance in tumor micro-environment was
therefore suggested [54]. For instance, IL-6 gene
amplification has been linked to GBM aggressiveness
and poor patient survival [55, 56]. Both of transgenic
animals and in vitro investigations reported that
overexpression of the canonical IL-6 signaling pathway
is a major characteristic in human neoplasia and that
oncogenic overexpression of this pathway can occur
at many levels [57, 58]. Furthermore, IL6-mediated
suppression of miR200c drives the transformation
of breast cancer cells [59], and activation of an IL6
inflammatory feedback loop leads to expansion of cancer
stem cell population in malignant carcinomas [32]. In
addition, IL-6 was shown to induce breast cancer stem
cell formation from non-stem cancer cells through an
autocrine/paracrine mechanism [30] and to regulate
epigenetic modification of microRNAs in malignant
human cholangiocarcinoma [60]. It is noteworthy that
Chiou et al. reported a paracrine feedback regulatory
loop between miR142-3p and IL-6 in GBM cells
[33], in which IL-6 suppresses miR142-3p expression
through increasing its promoter methylation, while
miR142-3p inhibits IL-6 expression and secretion by
directly targeting IL-6 3’UTR. Additionally, AKT is
previously reported to play positive role in regulating
IL-6 biogenesis and secretion by NF-kappaB and MAPK
pathway, supporting that AKT may upstream modulator
in IL-6 pro-inflammatory pathway [61, 62]. Although the
definition of autocrine and paracrine differs from each
