ABSTRACT
F10 is an oligonucleotide based on the thymidylate synthase (TS) inhibitory
5-fluorouracil (5-FU) metabolite, 5-fluoro-2’-deoxyuridine-5’-O-monophosphate.
We sought to determine the activity of F10 against preclinical models of acute
lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). F10 treatment resulted in robust induction of apoptosis
that could not be equaled by 100 fold more 5-FU. F10 was more potent than Ara-C
and doxorubicin against a panel of murine and human ALL cells with an average
IC50 value of 1.48 nM (range 0.07 to 5.4 nM). F10 was more than 1000 times more
potent than 5-FU. In vivo, F10 treatment significantly increased survival in 2 separate
syngeneic ALL mouse models and 3 separate xenograft models. F10 also protected
mice from leukemia-induced weight loss. In ALL cells made resistant to Ara-C, F10
remained highly active in vitro and in vivo. Using labeled F10, uptake by the ALL cell
lines DG75 and SUP-B15 was rapid and profoundly temperature-dependent. Both cell
lines demonstrated increased uptake compared to normal murine lineage- depleted
marrow cells. Consistent with this decreased uptake, F10 treatment did not alter the
ability of human hematopoietic stem cells to engraft in immunodeficient mice.

INTRODUCTION

~10%, and has not significantly improved since the 1980’s
[3]. This is further complicated by the fact that the median
age of adults at diagnosis is ≥60 [4].
This poor outcome is attributable to a combination
of increased adverse tumor biology and decreased
tolerance of therapy [5]. As a result, despite a high initial
remission rate, most adults with ALL are destined to
relapse, and once relapse occurs, outcomes are particularly
dismal. In a large study of adult patients with ALL after
their first relapse, the 5-year survival rate was 7%. The
authors stated that most adults with recurrent ALL “cannot
be rescued with current therapies” [6]. Virtually all active
therapies are used during first-line treatment leaving
nothing for relapsed disease. There is clearly a need for
additional active therapies in ALL.

Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is an
aggressive hematologic malignancy wherein an abnormal
proliferation of lymphoblasts suppresses normal
hematopoiesis, resulting in progressive marrow failure and
death [1]. There are approximately 6,000 cases per year
diagnosed in the United States [1]. ALL has a bimodal age
distribution with an initial peak in childhood and second
that increases in older adults. While outcomes for ALL
in children have improved (approximately 85-90% cure
rate with modern chemotherapy regimens [2]), outcomes
in adults are much worse (estimated 30-45% cure rate [3]).
The cure rate is worse still in patients over the age of 60;
the 5-year survival rate in these patients is estimated at

Many current drug development efforts are focused
on the identification and targeting of specific deregulated
oncogenic pathways. This is in part the result of the
dramatic success of agents like imatinib that targets the
BCR-ABL kinase. The use of imatinib in chronic-phase
chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) has changed
the natural history of the disease [7]. Unfortunately,
the durable responses seen in CML are not reproduced
in BCR-ABL positive ALL [8]. Indeed, genetically
homogenous cancers that are reliant on a single oncogenic
pathway have proven to be the exception rather than
the rule. Targeting of a single oncogenic pathway in
genetically complex malignancies like ALL have resulted
in only transient responses with frequent relapses.
An alternative approach is to use agents that target
“final common pathways”, i.e. processes that must be
accomplished to produce additional cancer cells regardless
of driving mutations. In this paradigm, agents are not
judged by differential expression of a target, but by the
degree of differential uptake. One pathway to exploit is
the known increased uptake of oligonucleotides by ALL
cells [9]. F10 is a poison deoxy-oligonucleotide that is a
10mer of the TS inhibitory 5-FU metabolite, 5-fluoro-2’deoxyuridine-5’-O-monophosphate. F10 has high activity
against preclinical models of acute myeloid leukemia
by targeting both TS and topoisomerase I (TopoI [10]).
Activity of these targets is essential for any replicating
cell regardless of driving mutations. In our previous

analysis, Jurkat cells, a human T cell ALL line, exhibited
low nanomolar sensitivity to F10 suggesting F10 may also
have utility in ALL. In this study we sought to determine
the activity, toxicity and uptake of F10 in preclinical
models of ALL.

RESULTS:
F10 is highly active against ALL in vitro. In our
previous work, F10 demonstrated high-potency cell
killing in the human T cell ALL line, Jurkat. To assess
its activity further, a panel of human and mouse ALL cell
lines were exposed to a titration of F10, 5-FU, cytarabine,
or doxorubicin. After 72 hours, viability was assessed
and the IC50 values for each were determined in three
separate experiments each done in triplicate. The average
IC50 value of F10 for all cell lines was 1.48 nM (range
0.07 to 5.4 nM). In all cases, F10 was the most potent
agent tested, and for all cell lines tested, it was more than
1000 times more potent than 5-FU (Table 1). In AML,
F10 exposure results in a robust induction of apoptosis
[10]. To see if ALL cells respond in a similar fashion, we
exposed murine and human ALL cells to F10 and assessed
induction of apoptosis. After 72-hour exposure, there was
a robust induction of Annexin V and PI positive cells when
treated with 1nM F10 that could not be equalled by 100nM
5-FU despite 10 times more fluoropyrimidine content
(Figures 1A, 1B, Supplemental Figure 1). These results

demonstrate that F10 is handled as a distinct biochemical
entity and is not just another vehicle to deliver 5-FU.
F10 is highly active against multiple preclinical ALL
models in vivo. F10 exhibited high potency against ALL
cells in vitro however many variables present in patients
are not accounted for in these types of assays. In order to
be of clinical utility F10 must be able to induce ALL cell
death when the cells are in the appropriate bone marrow
microenvironment, with intact immune systems and with
transient exposures. The precise syngeneic B cell ALL
model (B6 ALL) incorporates all of these factors [11]. We
injected 1x106 B6 ALL cells into 6-8 week old syngeneic
C57Bl/6 mice. After confirmation of engraftment by
luciferase imaging mice were treated with F10 at 300
mg/kg or saline by tail vein injection every other day
(QOD) for 4, 6 or 9 treatments. After 4 treatments, F10
significantly prolonged survival compared to controls
(median OS 15 vs 18 days, p= < 0.0001). By 6 treatments,
the median OS increased to 24 days (p= 0.0009), and by 9
treatments, F10 had doubled the median OS of controls at
30 days (p= 0.0001, Figure 2A).
To ensure these effects were not secondary to some
inherent sensitivity in the B6 ALL cell line, we tested
Baf-3 cells infected with an MSCV-based virus that
expressed the T315 variant of BCR-ABL seen in many
cases of relapsed Philadelphia chromosome-positive ALL
[8]. Infected cells were then injected into Balb/c mice.
Once engraftment was confirmed by bioluminescent
imaging, mice received F10 at 300 mg/kg or saline by tail
vein injection QOD x 4 doses. As before, F10 treatment
significantly prolonged survival (p= 0.0013; Figure 2B).
To establish that the high efficacy was not limited
to murine ALL cells, we tested F10 in SUP-B15, Jurkat,
and DG75 human ALL cell lines in xenograft models.
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Nude mice were subcutaneously injected with 2x106 cells
in Matrigel. Once a reproducibly palpable tumor was
established, mice were treated with F10 at 300 mg/kg or
saline by tail vein injection QOD for 5 doses. In all cases,
F10 treatment resulted in tumor regression (Figure 2C, D,
E), and in several cases resulted in complete eradication
of the tumor. F10 also resulted in a significant survival
advantage (p= 0.0098; Figure 2F). These data demonstrate
the robust in vivo antileukemic activity of F10 and further
show its activity against ALL with diverse lineages and
driving mutations.
F10 is a potent inhibitor of TS and TS and
Topoisomerase I are widely expressed in human ALL
cells. Previously, we demonstrated that F10 was a more
potent inhibitor of TS than 5-FU in human AML cells
[10]. To determine if F10 had a similar inhibitory activity
in ALL cells, we treated Jurkat cells with either 10 nM
F10 or 100 nM 5-FU. As in AML, F10 treatment resulted
in profound and prolonged TS inhibition that could not
be achieved by 5-FU despite the identical amount of
fluoropyrimidine being present (Figure 3A). Additionally,
F10 generates trapped topoisomerase I (topoI) cleavage
complexes resulting in apoptosis [12]. To determine how
widely expressed TS and TopoI are in ALL cells, we
performed Western blots against both proteins in a panel
of human and murine ALL cell lines. As expected for
proteins required for DNA synthesis, both were detectable
in all cell lines, despite their diverse linages and driving
mutations (Figure 3B). These data demonstrate that F10 is
a potent inhibitor of TS, and that TS and TopoI are widely
expressed in ALL. Taken together, these data suggest that
F10 is likely to be efficacious for many patients with ALL.
F10 is active in cytarabine-resistant ALL cells.

essentially all active agents. As a result, when the disease
relapses response rates are low and median survival is less
than a year [6]. Since F10 has distinct cellular targets, we
sought to determine if it would have activity against ALL
cells that acquired resistance to cytarabine. Cytarabine
was chosen because it is widely used in ALL treatment.
To generate cytarabine-resistant cells, we injected C57Bl/6
mice with B6 ALL cells and treated them with cytarabine
until loss of response. When the mice were moribund, we
harvested bilateral femur cells from 3 separate mice and
placed them in culture. The relapsed cells were resistant
to cytarabine compared with the parental cell line with
a more than doubling of the IC50 from 10.9 nM to an
average of 24.7 nM (Figure 4A). In contrast, the average

IC50 value for F10 in the resistant lines was 70.07 pM
comparable to the parental line IC50 of 68.95 pM (Figure
4B).
We then injected C57Bl/6 mice with relapsed cells;
after engraftment, we treated mice either with saline,
cytarabine (100 mg/kg QOD), or F10 (300 mg/kg QOD)
and followed them for survival. Saline-treated mice died in
a median of 12 days and cytarabine-treated animals lived
only a day longer. F10-treated animals lived for a median
of 31 days, comparable to the survival achieved with the
parental cell line (Figure 4C). These data demonstrate that
F10 is not cross-resistant with cytarabine and suggests it
will be highly efficacious in relapsed ALL.
F10 is well tolerated and does not harm human

hematopoietic stem cells. In previous studies, F10 was
well tolerated by C57Bl/6 mice [10]. To establish that
F10 tolerability was not specific to the C57Bl/6 strain,
we treated Balb/c mice with saline, 5-FU (121 mg/kg)
or F10 (300 mg/kg QOD x4) and then sacrificed animals
72 hours after the last dose. The 5-FU dose was chosen
to deliver the same amount of fluoropyrimidine as the
F10 dose at 300 mg/kg. Tissues from the gastrointestinal
tract and bone marrow were analyzed by a veterinary
pathologist blinded to treatment. F10 treatment resulted
in only minimal marrow toxicity, whereas 5-FU resulted
in a pancytopenic and hemorrhagic marrow (Figure 5A).
Similarly, 5-FU treatment induced abundant tissue damage
and immune cell infiltration in the gastrointestinal tract,
whereas F10 treatment resulted in only a mild increase in
apoptotic cells (Figure 5A).
Previous work has demonstrated that F10 does
not significantly alter the ability of murine HSCs to
engraft into recipients compared to control cells [10]. To
determine if F10 would inhibit the ability of human HSCs
to engraft, we treated normal human HSCs with saline or
50nM F10 for 24 hours and then injected the cells into
NSG transgenic mice. After 60 days mice were sacrificed,
bilateral femur cells harvested and engraftment assessed

by staining for human CD45. Pretreatment with 50 nM
F10 did not alter the engraftment of human HSCs (Figure
5B). By contrast, when B6 ALL cells were treated with
saline or 50 nM F10 for 24 hours before injection into
syngeneic C57Bl/6 mice, F10 treatment significantly
reduced engraftment (Figure 5C). Additionally, F10
protected the mice from leukemia-induced weight loss
during treatment and for several days after (Supplemental
Figure 2). These data demonstrate that F10 has little
toxicity towards human HSCs, bone marrow, and the
gastrointestinal tract whereas it is highly potent against
murine ALL-initiating cells.
F10 is efficiently taken up by ALL cells in vitro
and in vivo. Previous studies demonstrated that leukemia
cells take up oligonucleotides with greater efficacy than
normal white blood cells [9]. To determine the uptake
characteristics of F10, we incubated human ALL cells with
a fluorescently labeled F10. When DG75 and SUP-B15
cells were incubated with Quasar 670-labeled F10, mean
fluorescence intensity increased rapidly, with detectable
uptake in as little as 30 minutes (Figure 6A). Furthermore,
this uptake was diminished in the presence of an excess of
unlabeled F10 and had profound temperature dependence,
suggestive of an active carrier-mediated process
(Supplemental Figure 3A+B). To confirm rapid uptake
occurred in vivo, we injected highly leukemic C57Bl/6
mice with Quasar 670-labeled F10 and harvested bilateral
femur cells after 2 and 6 hours. Uptake was detectable
after 2 hours and increased at 6 hours (Figure 6B). To

assess if the differential toxicity seen between normal
marrow cells and ALL cells was related to uptake, we
incubated linage-depleted murine marrow cells and DG75
and SUP-B15 cells with Quasar 670-labeled F10. Both
ALL cell lines had a more rapid uptake of F10 compared
to the linage-depleted marrow cells (Figure 6C). These
data demonstrate a rapid uptake of F10 by ALL cells
compared to normal hematopoietic cells. This differential
uptake may contribute to the high efficacy and low toxicity
of F10.

in genetically homogenous malignancies in complex
malignancies, like the acute leukemias, such targeted
therapy simply selects for resistant subclones. Here we
describe a different approach where the drug targets are
absolutely required for cell proliferation regardless of
driving mutations. In this paradigm, agents are judged
by their degree of selective uptake, not the selective
expression of the target.
F10 is a poison oligodeoxynucleotide that has
remarkable antileukemic activity against multiple
preclinical AML models [10]. We observed in those
studies that F10 was also highly effective against a
human T cell ALL line. Additionally, leukemia cells have
enhanced uptake of deoxy-oligonucleotides [9]. For these
reasons we sought to determine the efficacy of F10 against
preclinical ALL models.
The current report includes several important
observations. First, F10 was highly effective against
both murine and human ALL cells, with low nanomolar
to picomolar IC50 values. It also demonstrated in vivo
efficacy against 2 separate syngeneic and 3 xenograft ALL

DISCUSSION:
ALL is an aggressive cancer of the marrow resulting
in marrow failure and death. Despite major advances in
the cure rate of ALL in children, results in adults remain
unsatisfactory. The current drug development paradigm
in oncology is heavily weighted towards drug targets that
are uniquely expressed by tumor cells. The belief is that
specific inhibition of such targets will result in cancer cell
death while sparing normal cells. While highly effective

models. Second, the targets of F10, TS, and TopoI, are
widely expressed in ALL cell lines. F10 displayed potent
and prolonged TS inhibition in ALL cells that could not
be equaled by 5-FU. Third, F10 had remarkable activity
against ALL cells that were resistant to cytarabine both in
vitro and in vivo, demonstrating a lack of cross resistance
between the agents. Fourth, F10 was very well tolerated
by Balb/c mice. Importantly, it did not affect the ability of
normal human HSCs to engraft in immunocompromised
mice, but it severely impaired ability of murine ALL cells
to engraft. Finally, F10 was rapidly taken up by ALL
cells in a highly temperature- dependent fashion that
was inhibited in the presence of an excess of unlabeled
compound, suggesting receptor mediated active transport.
Further studies to characterize the uptake mechanism of
F10 are ongoing.
F10’s unique mechanism of action results in
incorporation of dUMP and FdUMP into DNA in
actively replicating cells [12]. As a result, once cells
have completed S phase, they are can no longer be
rescued by exogenous thymidine and undergo apoptotic
cell death [12]. This apoptotic response does not appear
to be p53-dependent [10]. These characteristics suggest
F10 may have activity in hard-to-treat ALL subsets with
loss of p53 [13]. Additionally, F10 and its metabolite
FdUMP are chemically distinct from other nucleoside
analogs used to treat ALL, and should not be subjected
to dephosphorylation by cytosolic 5′-nucleotidase II
(NT5C2). This is of interest as activating mutations in
NT5C2 have been found in 20% of relapsed T cell ALL
patients [14].
The use of therapeutic oligonucleotides to target
specific genes has met with some success in the treatment
of leukemia [15-17]. F10 has several advantages compared
to this approach, because it directly targets TS and TopoI
without the need of base pairing to its target or shRNA
processing. The functions of F10’s targets are essential for
cell replication, regardless of driving mutations. This is
in contrast to targeting antiapoptotic or driving oncogenes
that could result in the outgrowth of resistant sub-clones.
It is of interest that the most sensitive human ALL cell
line was SUP-B15 and this line expressed TS at the lowest
level of all cell lines suggesting an inverse correlation
between TS expression level and F10 sensitivity. This is
consistent with our previous work in AML where cells
overexpressing TS were selected for by F10 treatment
[10]. If this relationship is confirmed, baseline TS levels
could be used as a predictive marker for future clinical
trials.
In summary, F10 exhibits remarkable activity
against human and murine ALL cells in vitro and in vivo
by inhibition of TS and subsequent induction of apoptosis.
F10 rapidly internalized by ALL cells and has low toxicity,
favorable chemical properties and straight forward
synthesis. It is an ideal candidate for future clinical
development, particularly as an agent that can be used
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

in developing countries. These data demonstrate agents
that target “final common pathways” but with differential
uptake can be safe and effective, even against genetically
complex and aggressive leukemias.

METHODS:
Cell culture and viability assays
B6 ALL cells were a kind gift of Dr Nidal Boulos
(St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital, Memphis, TN
[11]). All human cell lines were maintained in RPMI
media (Gibco, Carlsbad, CA) supplemented with 10%
FBS, penicillin and streptomycin. Cells were grown at
37oC with 5% CO2. All murine cells were maintained
in B cell media (45% DMEM, 45% IMDM, 10% FBS,
supplemented with penicillin and streptomycin). Viability
assays were done using the Cell Titer-Glo assay (Promega,
Madison, WI) according to the manufacturer’s protocol or
by Trypan blue exclusion assay using the Countess cell
counting system (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). All viability
assays were done in triplicate in at least three separate
experiments (at least 9 values for each concentration
tested).

Normal human HSCs
All samples were collected under an IRB-approved
protocol. All patients gave written informed consent.
All samples were obtained during clinically-indicated
procedures. HSCs were obtained from healthy allogeneic
stem cell transplant donors. Cells were obtained from
GM-CSF-primed apheresis of peripheral blood, Ficoll
separated, and stored at -80oC until use.

Western blots
Samples were lysed in Laemmli buffer, separated
by SDS-PAGE, and transferred to an Immobilon PVDF
membrane (Millipore, Billerica, MA). Antibodies against
p53 (IMX25, 1:1000; Leica Microsystems), TS (#355800, 1:1000; Invitrogen), Topoisomerase I (556597,
1:2000; BD Pharmingen), Caspase 3 (9662, 1:2000; Cell
Signalling) and actin (AC-15, 1:5000; Abcam) were used.
Secondary antibodies were anti-mouse (7076, 1:5000; Cell
Signalling) or anti-rabbit (7074, 1:5000; Cell Signalling).

In vivo treatment studies
The Wake Forest University Institutional Animal
Care and Use Committee approved all mouse experiments.
Luciferase-tagged B6 ALL leukemia cells were

recipient mice by tail-vein injection of 1 x 106 viable cells
for parental studies or 0.5 x 106 for relapsed studies. Mice
were monitored by bioluminescent imaging on day 6.
Imaging was performed using an IVIS100 imaging system
(Caliper LifeSciences, Hopkinton, MA). Mice were
injected with 150 mg/kg D-Luciferin (Gold Biotechnology,
St. Louis, MO), anesthetized with isoflurane, and imaged
for 2 min. For the xenograft studies, 6-8-wk old nude mice
were subcutaneously injected with 2x106 cells mixed with
200 mcl matrigel (BD Bioscience). Chemotherapy was
initiated upon detection of clear signals or reproducibly
palpable flank tumors. Mice were treated with 300mg/kg
F10 by tail vein injection. Control animals were injected
with PBS. Tumor volumes were calculated using the
method of Jensen et. al. [18]. Repeat luciferase imaging or
tumor volume measurements were performed following
treatment. In vivo uptake assays were done by injection
of parental B6 ALL cells or saline as above and animals
were monitored until body-wide bioluminescence was
detected with areas of saturation consistent with high
tumor burden. Animals were then injected with 1-2 mg
of Quasar 670-labeled F10 and after 2 hours animals
were euthanized and bilateral femur marrow isolated and
analyzed by flow cytometry.

marrow was harvested and stained with APC-conjugated
anti-human CD45 antibody (BD Pharmingen, San Diego,
CA) and analyzed by flow cytometry.

Apoptosis assays
Cells were seeded in 6-well plates at 25,000 or
50,000 cells/ml in 3mls, grown for 2 days and treated with
the indicated drug. After centrifugation and washing in
cold PBS cells were stained with PI (Sigma Aldrich, St.
Louis, MO) and APC-conjugated Annexin V in a binding
buffer (10 mM HEPES (pH 7.4), 140 mM NaCl, and 2.5
mM CaCl2 solution) (BD Pharmingen, San Jose, CA)
according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Flow cytometric
analysis was conducted on a Accuri flow cytometer (BD
Biosciences).

F10 Uptake assays
Cells were incubated for the indicated amount
of time with F10 labeled with Quasar 670 (Biosearch
Technologies Novato, CA) at the 5’-terminus. All in
vitro incubations were done at 37 oC in 5% CO2. The
fluorophore was incorporated as a phosphoramidite during
solid-phase DNA synthesis.

Generation of cytarabine resistant ALL cells

TS catalytic activity

Luciferase-tagged B6 ALL leukemia cells were
transplanted into 6- to 8-wk-old, female C57Bl/6 recipient
mice by tail-vein injection of 1 x 106 viable cells. Upon
detection of engraftment by bioluminescent imaging
mice were treated with cytarabine at 100 mg/kg until
they became moribund. Animals were then humanely
euthanized and leukemia cells harvested from femur
marrow. Three separate animals were harvested and the
resulting cells were assessed for cytarabine resistance.
These cells were then grown in culture and injected into
secondary recipients as above.

Cells were plated at 1.5 x106 cells in 100 mm2
plates and grown overnight in RPMI 1640 medium with
20% FBS. Cells were exposed to the indicated drug for
8, 16, 24, or 48 hours. Cells were then harvested in 25
mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4 with Complete Protease Inhibitor
Cocktail (Roche), put through two freeze/thaw cycles,
and vortexed. The lysates were centrifuged at 10,000 x
g for 10 minutes at 4°C. TS assays were performed in a
final volume of 200 μl containing 75 μM 5,10 methylene
tetrahydrofolate in 0.5 M NaOH (Schircks Laboratories,
Switzerland), 10 μM dUMP, 200,000 dpm of 3H-dUMP
(Moravek Biochemicals), 100 μM 2-mercaptoethanol, and
25 mM KH2PO4, pH 7.4. Cell lysate (400 μg of protein)
was added to the reaction buffer. Reactions were incubated
at 37°C for 30 minutes and stopped by addition of 100 μl
of 20% TCA, incubated for 5 minutes on ice. 200 μL of
activated charcoal solution (10 g activated charcoal, 0.25
g BSA, 0.25 gm dextran sulfate, in 100 ml of water) was
added, vortexed and maintained at room temperature for
10 minutes. Reactions were centrifuged at 10,000 x g for
30 minutes. 200 μL aliquots of the supernatant were read
by scintillation counting. All reactions were repeated a
minimum of three times.

Toxicology studies and murine bone marrow
transplantation
Normal Balb/c mice were treated with the identical
dose, schedule and route of each drug as in the efficacy
studies (i.e. Day 1, 3, 5 and 7). 72 hours after the last dose,
animals were sacrificed, bilateral femoral cells harvested
and organs fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin
followed by routine tissue processing and sectioning for
hematoxylin and eosin staining. Slides were then reviewed
by a veterinary pathologist using a Nikon Eclipse 50i
light microscope. Tissues were photographed using the
NIS Elements D3.10 camera and software system. For
transplant studies transgenic NSG (Jackson Laboratories)
mice were irradiated to 2.7 gray and injected with 2.6x106
normal human HSCs. After 60 days recipient femoral bone

All means were compared by two-tailed Student’s T
test. Overall survival (OS) curves were estimated by the
Kaplan-Meier method and p values were determined by
the log rank test. P values below 0.05 were considered
significant. Analysis was performed using Graph Pad
Prism version 5.02 (Graph Pad Software Inc).
