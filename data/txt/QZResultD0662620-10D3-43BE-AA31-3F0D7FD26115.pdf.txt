BACKGROUND: Atypical teratoid/rhaboid tumors (AT/RTs) and extracranial malignant rhabdoid tumors are highly
malignant neoplasms with a dismal prognosis. These tumors predominantly affect infants and targeted, adjuvant
treatment approaches would be highly desirable. METHODS: In the current study, the authors investigated the
expression and functional role of tyrosine kinases in 2 malignant rhabdoid tumor cell lines (A204 and G401) and in a
series of 5 AT/RTs and 18 malignant rhabdoid tumors (13 rhabdoid tumors of the kidney and 5 extrarenal rhabdoid
tumors). RESULTS: Both cell lines consistently expressed the tyrosine kinase c-Abl, which promoted proliferation as
assessed by small interfering RNA knockdown. Blockage of c-Abl using the tyrosine kinase inhibitor imatinib resulted
in reduced cellular growth in both cell lines. Furthermore, c-Abl was expressed in all rhabdoid tumors, whereas
expression of platelet-derived growth factor receptor subtypes alpha and beta was infrequent and c-Kit expression
was absent. CONCLUSIONS: The current data pointed toward a role for c-Abl in the biology of malignant rhabdoid
tumors and provided a rationale for the investigation of tyrosine kinase inhibitors that target c-Abl for the treatment

Malignant rhabdoid tumors were described initially as tumors of renal and soft tissue origin,1,2 whereas atypical
teratoid/rhabdoid tumors (AT/RTs) are rhabdoid tumors of the central nervous system.3 Both tumor entities are characterized by the presence of rhabdoid tumor cells, and AT/RTs as well as rhabdoid tumors of the kidney are characterized by genetic alterations that affect the SWI/SNF-related matrix-associated actin-dependent regulator of chromatin
subfamily B member 1 (SMARCB1) gene, resulting in a loss of integrase interactor 1 (INI1) protein expression.4,5
The prognosis is dismal: In patients with AT/RT, a median survival as short as 11 months was reported initially.6
However, some progress in the treatment of AT/RTs has been achieved by the introduction of highly aggressive multimodality treatments, including extended sarcoma-like chemotherapy protocols with intrathecal therapy, early local
radiotherapy, and high-dose chemotherapy with stem-cell rescue.7,8 Because treatment-related toxicity generally is
high, targeted adjuvant treatment approaches are highly desirable. Previous data suggest that tyrosine kinase receptor
signaling may play a role in the biology of more common pediatric solid tumors, such as medulloblastomas, ependymomas, and choroid plexus tumors, and in Ewing sarcomas and neuroblastomas.9-16 Imatinib, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor directed against c-Abl, c-Kit and platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) receptor subtypes a and b,17 reportedly
is tolerated relatively well in children.18,19 Because it has been demonstrated that imatinib inhibits proliferation of the
rhabdoid tumor cell line BT12,20 our objective was to investigate the expression and functional role of tyrosine
kinases targeted by imatinib in rhabdoid tumors.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Tumor Samples
Paraffin-embedded, formalin-fixed samples of 5 AT/RTs
were retrieved from the archives of the Institute of Neuropathology, University Hospital Muenster. and 18 extracranial rhabdoid tumor samples (13 rhabdoid tumors of
the kidney and 5 extrarenal malignant rhabdoid tumors)
were retrieved from the archives of the Institute of Pathology, University Hospital Schleswig-Holstein. Two children had been examined as part of the Rhabdoid 2007
Study.21 In all patients, the diagnosis was confirmed histopathologically by board-certified pathologists (I.L.) and
neuropathologists (W.P., M.H.) and included immunohistochemical evaluation for loss of nuclear staining of
INI1/SMARCB1.22,23
Cell Cultures
For functional studies, rhabdoid tumor cell lines G40124
and A20425 were used. The 2 cell lines were cultured in
Dulbecco minimal essential medium high-glucose formulation (PAA; Pasching, Austria) supplemented with 10%
fetal bovine serum and antibiotics. Cells were cultured at
37 C in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2. For
immunocytochemistry, confluent cultures were trypsinized and centrifuged. Pellets were fixed with 4% formaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) overnight and
then embedded in paraffin. In line with previous findings,26 both cell lines lacked expression of INI1/
SMARCB1, whereas brahma-related gene 1 (BRG1)/
SMARCA4 expression was retained. This constellation is
characteristic for malignant rhabdoid tumors.27
Immunohistochemistry
Tissue arrays generated from 5 AT/RTs (4 or 5 samples of
0.6 mm each) and 18 malignant rhabdoid tumors (2 or 3
samples of 1.5 mm each) were deparaffinized, rehydrated,
then washed in distilled H2O. For antigen retrieval, slides
were microwaved for twice for 7 minutes each and then
washed in a buffer of PBS, bovine serum albumin (BSA),
and Triton X-100 (PBT) 3 times for 5 minutes each. The
slides were blocked in 20% goat serum diluted in PBT for
30 minutes and then incubated with anti-PDGF receptor
beta (anti-PDGFRB)(no. 3169 rabbit monoclonal; 2 lg/
mL; Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, Mass), antiPDGF receptor alpha (anti-PDGFRA)(no. 3164 rabbit
polyclonal; 1:50 dilution; Cell Signaling Technology),
anti-c-Kit (A4502 rabbit polyclonal; 1:400 dilution;
Dako, Glostrup, Denmark), and anti-c-Abl (ab15130
rabbit polyclonal; 1:100 dilution; Abcam, Cambridge,

5076

United Kingdom). After washes in PBT, the slides were
incubated with a biotinylated goat antirabbit secondary
antibody (E0432; 1:500 dilution; Dako) for 45 minutes
at room temperature after incubation with the ABC kit
(SK6100; Vectastain avidin-biotin complex-horseradish
peroxidase [ABC-HRP]; Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, Calif) for 45 minutes after washing in PBT. The
signal was developed using a 3,30 -diaminobenzidine
(DAB) substrate kit (SK4100; Vector Laboratories), and
the sections were counterstained with hematoxylin. For
negative controls, sections were stained as described above
using only the secondary antibody. Staining was rated as 0
(absent) or 1 (present). Furthermore, the percentage of
positively stained cells was estimated for c-Abl.
Immunoblot Analysis
Proteins of both cell lines were separated on 7.5% sodium
dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gels and transferred to
nitrocellulose membranes. Membranes were then blocked
using 5% BSA in a buffer of Tris, NaCl, Tween-20 (TST
buffer) for 30 minutes and incubated with a primary rabbit antibody against c-Abl (1:100 dilution in 3% BSA/
TST; Ab15130; Abcam) at room temperature for 3 hours.
Detection was performed with a peroxidase-conjugated
secondary antirabbit antibody and the ECL plus kit.
Upon stripping, the membranes were reprobed with an
antibody against b-actin (1:10,000 dilution; A5441;
Sigma Chemical Company, St. Louis Mo).
Chromogenic In Situ Hybridization
Chromogenic in situ hybridization (CISH) was performed using the tissue arrays comprised of 5 AT/RTs
and 18 MRTs in addition to both cell lines. Briefly, digoxigenin-labeled (DIG-Nick mix; Roche, Mannheim, Germany) bacterial artificial chromosome probes were used
for PDGFRA (a mixture of clones: RP11-117E8 and
RP11-626H4) and for PDGFRB (clone RP11-754J8;
Invitrogen Ltd., Paisley, United Kingdom) as well as for
c-Abl (clone RP11-83J21; Finnzymes, Espoo, Finnland).
Gene copy numbers were evaluated using a Leica
DM2000 (Leica Microsystems, Wetzlar, Germany) at
63 and 100 magnification. Amplification was defined
as 6 signals per nucleus.
RNA Interference
Two different small interfering RNA (siRNA) oligonucleotides for c-Abl inhibition (SI00288316 Hs_
ABL_1_10 and SI00299096 Hs_ABL1_7) in addition to
a nonsilencing control siRNA (1027280 All Star negative

control siRNA) were purchased from Qiagen (Alameda,
Calif). Cells were seeded at a concentration of 1.2  105
cells per mL the day before siRNA transfection in 24-well
plates in 500 lL culture medium. Cells were transfected
by adding 3 lL HiPerfect Transfection Reagent (Qiagen)
and 2 lL siRNA per well dissolved in culture medium
without FCS according to the manufacturer’s recommendations. Cells were maintained in full culture medium for
24 hours, 48 hours, 72 hours, and 96 hours before analysis; and the extent of RNA knockdown under these
conditions was determined by quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction.
Proliferation
Cell suspensions (10,000 and 5000 cells/100 lL for the
A204 and G401 cell lines, respectively) were seeded into
96-well plates. Cells were allowed to reach exponential
growth before 100 lL of cell culture medium containing
imatinib at different concentrations was added (8 wells
per condition). Imatinib was administered in concentrations of 10-0.01 lM. Proliferation was assessed using a
methylthiazolyldiphenyl-tetrazolium bromide (MTT)
assay as described previously.14 To evaluate the effect of
c-Abl knockdown, after 24 hours of incubation with
siRNA as described above, cells were seeded into 96-well
plates at the same densities noted above. After further
incubation for 0 hours, 24 hours, 48 hours, and 72 hours,
the viability of cells was evaluated.
Statistical Analysis
The effects of siRNA treatment on proliferation were evaluated by using an analysis of variance (ANOVA) and the
least square difference test, whereas the effects of imatinib
were evaluated with a nonparametric ANOVA (KruskalWallis test) followed by the Mann-Whitney test. All statistical analyses were performed using SPSS software (version 15.0; SPSS Inc., Chicago, Ill).

RESULTS
c-Abl Is Expressed Consistently in
Rhabdoid Tumors
Distinct cytoplasmic expression of c-Abl was encountered
in all 23 rhabdoid tumors, and from 10% to 95% of tumor cells were positive for c-Abl (Fig. 1A,B, respectively).
Although c-Abl expression in rhabdoid tumors of the liver
and kidney was strong (range, 10%-95% positively
stained cells), staining in AT/RT was less extensive (range,
11%-68% positively stained cells). Nevertheless, staining

was present in all AT/RT samples. In contrast to c-Abl
expression, positive staining for the other examined tyrosine kinases was less frequent: Membranous PDGFRA
staining was observed in 5 of 23 samples (22%), including
4 of 5 AT/RT samples (80%) and 1 of 18 malignant rhabdoid tumors of the liver and kidney (6%). PDGFRB
staining was observed in 5 of 23 rhabdoid tumors (22%),
in 1 of 5 AT/RT samples (20%), and 4 of 18 malignant
rhabdoid tumors of the liver and kidney (22%). c-Kit
expression was absent in all rhabdoid tumor samples. No
amplification of ABL1, PDGFRA, or PDGFRB was
observed in any of the 5 AT/RT samples or 18 extracranial
rhabdoid tumors that were examined by CISH.

using 2 specific siRNAs resulted in a significant decrease
of messenger RNA expression in c-Abl in A204 cells and
in G401 cells (residual expression: 8%  3% and 16% 
9% for A204 cells; 18%  9% and 13%  4% for G401
cells, respectively) after 24 hours of incubation as assessed
by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction.
Upon siRNA knockdown, the proliferation of A204 cells
was decreased to 79%  8% compared with Scr control
after 48 hours (P ¼ .037)(Fig. 2E). Similarly, c-Abl
down-regulation in G401 cells resulted in decreased proliferation of 38%  3%(relative to an Scr control) after 48
hours of incubation (P < .001)(Fig. 2F).

Imatinib Reduces Proliferation of
Rhabdoid Tumor Cells In Vitro
Both cell lines exhibited a dose-dependent effect on proliferation when incubated with different concentrations of
imatinib for 48 hours (P < .001 for A204; P ¼ .001 for
G401; n ¼ 3 experiments each). A concentration of 0.1
lM imatinib was sufficient to significantly reduce proliferation in A204 cells compared with control (mean 
standard deviation: 91%  10%; P < .05)(Fig. 2A). In
G401 cell, incubation with 1 lM imatinib revealed significantly reduced cellular growth compared with control
(90%  6%; P < .05)(Fig. 2B).

DISCUSSION
In the current study, we demonstrated that c-Abl is
expressed ubiquitously in rhabdoid tumors. All extracranial rhabdoid tumors had consistently strong c-Abl
expression. In fact, 12 of 18 tumors had >80% positively
stained cells for c-Abl. Staining in AT/RTs was less extensive but nonetheless was present. In contrast to PDGF
receptors,14,30 reports of c-Abl expression in central nervous system tumors remain sparse. It has been demonstrated that tyrosine kinases play a functional role in a
variety of pediatric neoplasms,11-15 and the few studies
that have evaluated c-Abl expression in brain tumors
encountered low expression levels in only a fraction of
tumors. For example, Haberler et al observed focal c-Abl
expression in only 7 of 101 glioblastomas.31 In contrast,
our data suggest that the expression of c-Abl is quite common in AT/RTs.
The finding of absent ABL1 amplification rules out
the possibility that the observed overexpression of c-Abl
protein is related to amplification of the ABL1 gene as
reported previously in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia.32 Furthermore, no amplifications of any of the other
tyrosine kinases that were evaluated were observed. It is
noteworthy that, in nonrhabdoid solid tumors, c-Abl is
coexpressed commonly with tyrosine kinase receptors like
PDGFR or epidermal growth factor receptor,33 which
does not appear to be the case in rhabdoid tumors. Nevertheless, the observed expression of c-Abl in rhabdoid
tumors provides a rationale for novel treatment concepts,
such as specific tyrosine kinase inhibitors like dasatinib
and imatinib. In rhabdoid tumors, no data regarding
safety and efficacy of these agents have been published to
date from larger clinical trials. Two children with AT/RTs
who had been stratified for imatinib treatment based on
PDGF receptor expression status experienced progressive

c-Abl Promotes Proliferation in
A204 and G401 Cells
The effect of imatinib on cell growth prompted us to evaluate the expression of tyrosine kinases that are inhibited
by imatinib. Both cell lines had extensive nuclear and
cytoplasmic expression of c-Abl (Fig. 2C,D for A204 and
G401 cells, respectively). On immunoblotting of rhabdoid tumor cell protein lysates with the c-Abl antibody
used for immunocytochemistry and immunohistochemical staining of tumor samples, the presence of a 90-kDa
band could be demonstrated (Fig. 2C,D), corresponding
to the previously described size of truncated c-Abl in cell
cultures.28,29 In addition, A204 cells had membranous
PDGFRA expression, whereas PDGFRB and c-Kit staining were lacking. In contrast, G401 cells had membranous
PDGFRB expression, but PDGFRA and c-Kit were not
expressed. By using CISH on both cell lines, no amplification of PDGFRA, PDGFRB, or ABL1 was observed (data
not shown).
Because c-Abl protein was expressed consistently in
both cell lines, next, we investigated the functional role of
c-Abl in these cells. Knockdown of c-Abl messenger RNA

in rhabdoid tumors. Our data strongly suggest that cAbl expression status should be taken into account in
clinical trials investigating the value of tyrosine kinase
inhibitors. One limitation of the current retrospective
study is the incompleteness of clinical data regarding

5079

Original Article

the impact of c-Abl expression on overall survival. However, because of the relatively small number of patients
with these rare tumors and the finding that different treatment regimens had been applied in our 23 patients, such
an approach may not be conclusive.
It is noteworthy that robust protein expression of cAbl also was encountered in the rhabdoid cell lines. Here,
Western blot analysis revealed a 90-kDa fragment. As
unprocessed c-Abl is an approximately 120-kDa protein,
this smaller fragment may be explained by cleavage of the
protein as demonstrated previously by Machuy et al.29
The finding that ABL1 knockdown resulted in reduced
proliferation in both cell lines indicates a functional
involvement of c-Abl in the cellular growth of rhabdoid
tumor cells in vitro and is well in line with previous findings in extracranial solid tumors, such as breast cancer.3436
To further evaluate this involvement, we studied blockage of c-Abl signaling by the tyrosine kinase inhibitor imatinib and observed a growth-inhibitory effect against
A204 cells and G401 cells that was comparable to the
effect observed in breast cancer cell lines that contained
highly active c-Abl kinases.36 Data regarding the efficacy
of tyrosine kinase inhibitors like imatinib in rhabdoid tumor cell lines have been controversial: 1 previous study
demonstrated that imatinib was effective against the rhabdoid tumor cell line BT12, whereas efficiency against
BT16 cells was not observed.20 It is tempting to speculate
that these discrepancies may be related to c-Abl
expression.
In conclusion, our data point toward a functional
role for c-Abl in the biology of rhabdoid tumors. The current results provide a rationale for the investigation of tyrosine kinase inhibitors that target c-Abl for the treatment
of these highly aggressive pediatric neoplasms.
