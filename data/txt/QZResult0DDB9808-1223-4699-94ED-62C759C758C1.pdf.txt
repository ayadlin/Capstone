A Model of Postsurgical Advanced Metastatic Breast Cancer
More Accurately Replicates the Clinical Efﬁcacy of
Antiangiogenic Drugs
Eric Guerin, Shan Man, Ping Xu, and Robert S. Kerbel

Abstract
The failure rate of randomized phase III oncology clinical trials is extremely high, even when preceded by
encouraging preclinical studies and phase II trial results of the same therapy. Thus, there is considerable effort
being made to improve the predictive clinical potential of preclinical models, in addition to improving phase II
trial design. With respect to the former, preclinical models have historically relied heavily on treatment of primary
spontaneous or transplanted tumors rather than the more common and therapeutically challenging clinical trial
circumstance of advanced metastatic disease. Here, we show that the oral antiangiogenic tyrosine kinase inhibitor
(TKI), sunitinib, which failed to meet primary or secondary survival endpoints in 4 separate phase III metastatic
breast cancer (MBC) trials, either alone or with chemotherapy, similarly failed to show monotherapy or
combination chemotherapy efﬁcacy in a model of postsurgical advanced MBC using a metastatic variant of
the MDA-MB-231 triple-negative human breast cancer. In contrast, the drug was effective when used to treat
established orthotopic primary tumors. Similar results were obtained with pazopanib monotherapy, another
antiangiogenic oral TKI. However, when an antibody targeting the VEGF pathway (DC101) was tested, it showed a
trend in modestly improving the efﬁcacy of paclitaxel therapy, thus resembling to a degree prior phase III clinical
results of bevacizumab plus paclitaxel in MBC. Our results suggest the potential value of treating postsurgical
advanced metastatic disease as a possible strategy to improve preclinical models for predicting outcomes in
patients with metastatic disease. Cancer Res; 73(9); 2743–8. 2013 AACR.

Introduction
An enduring problem in oncology experimental therapeutics has been the limited value of models involving treatment of
tumor-bearing mice to consistently predict outcomes later
assessed in clinical trials, particularly at the randomized phase
III level (1–4). A common scenario observed is positive and
sometimes even remarkable preclinical activity, which is then
followed by complete failure in the clinic (1–4). Such failures
add substantially to the cost of approved agents as well as
exposing patients with cancer enrolled in such trials to ineffective therapies. As a result, there is considerable effort to
identify potential causes for this discrepancy and develop
signiﬁcantly improved preclinical models (1–4) such as genetically engineered mouse models (GEMM) of cancer and
patient-derived xenografts (PDX) as opposed to the historically

more common use of transplantation of established cultured
tumor cell lines grown as solid primary tumors.
Although many factors have been proposed for the discrepant therapeutic outcomes observed between preclinical and
clinical studies (1–4), one factor, which has received scant
attention, is the failure to duplicate in mice treatment of
advanced visceral metastatic disease (5, 6). Most phase I and
II solid tumor clinical trials and the majority of phase III trials
involve patients with such disease. In many or most cases the
primary tumor has been surgically resected. The failure rate is
extremely high in phase III metastatic therapy trials (7) and
when therapies succeed, the beneﬁts in survival are frequently
incremental (8). Therefore we have developed several models
of postsurgical advanced metastatic disease using established
human tumor cell lines grown in immunodeﬁcient mice to
mimic the more challenging circumstance of treating patients
with metastatic disease (5). In most cases, the cell lines used are
variants previously selected in vivo for aggressive spontaneous
metastatic spread after the primary orthotopic tumor has been
surgically resected (5). One such variant, called LM2-4, was
serially selected in vivo from the commonly used MDA-MB-231
triple-negative human breast cancer cell line (9).
Here, we report the use of the aforementioned postsurgical
model of LM2-4 to evaluate the impact of several antiangiogenic drugs, used alone or in combination with paclitaxel
chemotherapy, and compare the results obtained with conventional treatment of established primary tumors. One of the

drugs we tested is sunitinib (Sutent), an oral tyrosine kinase
inhibitor (TKI), which targets VEGF receptors (VEGFR) and
platelet-derived growth factor receptors, among several others
(10). Based partly on very encouraging preclinical results in 3
different established primary breast cancer models (a transgenic model, a chemically-induced rat model, and a human
tumor xenograft model; ref. 10) and a bone colonization
experiment (10), sunitinib was subsequently evaluated in
patients with metastatic breast cancer (MBC); 4 independent
phase III trials were undertaken (11–15), 3 in combination with
chemotherapy (paclitaxel, or docetaxel, or capecitabine). All 4
trials failed to meet efﬁcacy endpoints of survival (11–15). This
stands in contrast to a phase III trial involving the anti-VEGF
antibody, bevacizumab (Avastin), when used with chemotherapy, for example, paclitaxel, which provided a clinical
beneﬁt, at least in progression-free survival (PFS), though not
in overall survival (OS; ref. 16). We also tested another antiangiogenic TKI, pazopanib and a monoclonal antibody that
targets the mouse VEGFR-2 (DC101). Sunitinib and DC101
were also evaluated with concurrent paclitaxel chemotherapy.
The purpose of these studies was to further validate the
preclinical strategy of using postsurgical models of advanced
metastatic disease to predict clinical outcomes involving
treatment of patients with metastatic disease by addressing
the following questions and comparing the results with prior
phase III trial outcomes: (i) is it the case that antiangiogenic
drug monotherapy has reduced or no therapeutic beneﬁt when
treating mice with advanced metastatic disease in contrast to
established primary tumors? (ii) What is the impact on outcomes when chemotherapy is used in combination with the
antiangiogenic agent? And, (iii) is there a difference in outcomes when using TKIs versus antibodies in combination with
chemotherapy?

Materials and Methods
Female CB-17 severe combined immunodeﬁcient (SCID)
mice were purchased from Charles River, and female YFP
SCID mice (17) were bred in house from breeding pairs
generously provided by Dr. Janusz Rak (McGill University,
Montreal). Mice at 6 to 8 weeks of age were used. MDA-MB
231/LM2.4 is a variant cell line of MDA-MB 231 selected in
vivo for aggressive spontaneous metastatic spread from
established but resected primary tumors and was grown in
cell culture as previously described (9). Cell line authentication was carried out by genotyping using Illumina mouse
linkage panel and conﬁrmed to be human in origin. Routine
mycoplasma screening is carried out in-house using commercial kits, which conﬁrmed the cell line is mycoplasma
free. Mammary fat pad injection (2  106 cells) was carried
out as previously described (9). Weekly caliper measurements were carried out to determine tumor growth and
tumor volume was calculated using the formula a2b/2 where
a is the width and b is the length. Treatment of primary
tumors was initiated when average volume was approximately 100 to 150 mm3, that is, 12 to 15 days after cell
injection. Surgical resection of the primary tumors was
carried out when the average tumor size was 400 mm3.

All mice were randomized just before initiation of treatment.
Antiangiogenic drugs were generously provided by the manufacturers, namely, sunitinib (Pﬁzer), pazopanib (GSK), and
DC101, the monoclonal antibody targeting mouse VEGFR-2
(ImClone/Eli Lilly). All drugs were prepared according to
manufacturer's speciﬁcations. Paclitaxel was dispensed by
Sunnybrook Pharmacy Department, Odette Cancer Center
(Toronto, Ontario, Canada) at 60 mg/mL and further diluted
with normal saline to the appropriate concentration. Control
mice received either vehicle and/or normal saline as appropriate. Sunitinib was administered by gavage at 60 mg/kg dose
daily for the ﬁrst 14 days followed by 5 days daily with 2 days
break thereafter to reduce toxicity as measured by weight loss.
Pazopanib 150 mg/kg was administered by gavage daily without interruption. Paclitaxel was administered intraperitoneally
(i.p.) at 50 mg/kg every 3 weeks in the studies, which included
combination with DC101 but the dose and schedule was
changed to 30 mg/kg once every 2 weeks in studies, which
involved combination with sunitinib or pazopanib to minimize
toxicity observed in SCID mice (18).

Results and Discussion
We ﬁrst tested sunitinib on the growth of primary established orthotopic (mammary fat pad) tumors. Cells from the
established variant of MDA-MB-231 called LM2.4, which was
selected in vivo for aggressive spontaneous metastatic spread
after surgical resection of the primary tumor (9) were injected
into the mammary fat pad of 6- to 8-week-old female SCID
mice, as described previously (9) in Materials and Methods. We
did not use a luciferase-tagged clone of LM2.4 (19) because we
have found that these cells have a reduced ability for spontaneous metastasis (unpublished observations), the basis of
which is currently unknown. When the primary tumors
reached a volume of approximately 100 to 150 mm3, sunitinib
was administered daily by gavage at a preclinically effective
dose of 60 mg/kg, and the treatment continued until end point.
As shown in Fig. 1A, a robust growth delay was observed,
similar to Abrams and colleagues using another human breast
cancer xenograft model (called MX-I; ref. 10). In the case of
Abrams and colleagues, this was paralleled by an increase in
OS, the extent of which was shown to be further enhanced by
combination with chemotherapy, for example, docetaxel (10).
In our case, the mice were sacriﬁced in this preliminary
experiment at an earlier deﬁned endpoint, namely, when the
control group tumors reached an average size of approximately
500 mm3 (Fig. 1A). However, in another experiment, shown
in Fig. 1B where the primary tumor was surgically resected
(at day 20) and the same therapy initiated 3 weeks later (i.e.,
when the mice have established visceral metastatic disease
based on numerous previous studies, e.g., ref. 9 in addition to
reproducibility and lack of variability of the short median
survival times), no impact of the same treatment on survival
was observed. This pattern of discrepancy in outcomes is not
speciﬁc for sunitinib as we observed a similar pattern using
pazopanib (as shown in Fig. 1C and D) where primary tumors
in control mice were allowed to grow in this case to endpoint of
1,700 mm3 and the therapy maintained until endpoint.

Figure 1. Differential impact of sunitinib or pazopanib monotherapy on primary breast tumor growth versus postsurgical advanced metastatic breast
cancer. Sunitinib administered daily inhibits primary tumor growth (A), but has no survival beneﬁt when treating advanced metastatic disease (B). The bottom
6
shows similar results with pazopanib administered daily (C and D). For A and B, 2  10 MDA-MB 231/LM2-4 cells were implanted into the mammary fat
pad of 6 CB-17 SCID female mice; in the primary tumor study, treatment with sunitinib was initiated 12 days later when average tumor size was 100 mm3;
in the advanced metastasis therapy study, primary tumors were surgically resected 20 days after cell injection when average size was approximately 400 mm3
and sunitinib treatment was initiated 21 days later. For C and D, 2  106 MDA-MB 231/LM2-4 cells were implanted in the primary tumor study (C),
pazopanib treatment was initiated 14 days later when average tumor size was 150 mm3; in the advanced metastasis therapy study (D), the primary tumors were
surgically resected 20 days after cell injection when average size was approximately 400 mm3 and treatment was initiated 19 days later.

We next assessed the impact of adding paclitaxel to
sunitinib. Shown in Fig. 2A and B is the impact on survival
of mice with advanced metastatic disease when maximum
tolerated dose (MTD) paclitaxel was combined with sunitinib. Two independent experiments were carried out. If
anything, there was a trend to reduced survival in the
combination treatment group compared with the mice
receiving paclitaxel alone, an observation that is consistent
with a phase III breast cancer trial of sunitinib plus another
taxane, docetaxel (12), where no added beneﬁt in PFS was
observed and OS was slightly reduced in the combination
treatment group (12). We would note that in the 2 experiments shown in Fig. 2A and B, there was a difference in the
therapeutic impact of paclitaxel alone. In one experiment
(shown in Fig. 2A) the paclitaxel monotherapy treatment
had no statistically signiﬁcant beneﬁt in median OS, whereas

www.aacrjournals.org

it did in the experiment shown in Fig. 2B. This difference
may be due to the more aggressive tumor growth we noted
in the experiment shown in Fig. 2A where all of the control
mice died by day 60 compared with experiment 2B where all
control mice died by day 70. Nevertheless in both experiments, sunitinib did not improve paclitaxel treatment outcomes. We also tested the effect of paclitaxel plus sunitinib
in the established primary tumor model (Fig. 2C); sunitinib
had a noticeable antitumor effect in contrast to paclitaxel;
the 2 drug combination was not signiﬁcantly different from
the sunitinib-treated group.
We next tested the antiangiogenic anti-VEGFR-2 antibody
known as DC101 (20). The rationale for doing so was based on
the results of the prior E2100 phase III trial evaluating bevacizumab with paclitaxel in patients with MBC, which showed
a gain in PFS of almost 6 months compared with paclitaxel

metastatic disease. Two independent metastatic therapy experiments are shown in A and B. Paclitaxel alone administered intraperitoneally at an MTD of 30
mg/kg once every 2 weeks shows extensions of median survival in A and B, which was not statistically signiﬁcant in one case (A). Combination of sunitinib with
paclitaxel does not improve the survival advantages over paclitaxel alone (B) and may even worsen outcome (A). In the advanced metastasis studies,
median survival for (i) control vehicle treatment was 54 to 65 days, (ii) paclitaxel treatment was 61 to 88.5 days, (iii) sunitinib treatment was 65 to 66 days, and (iv)

alone (16). As shown in Fig. 3A, DC101 had a robust antitumor
effect when used to treat established LM2.4 primary tumors.
The paclitaxel treatment, once again, did not have an antitumor effect when used to treat primary tumors. The 2 drug
combination was the most effective. However, as shown in Fig.
3B the pattern of response as assessed by survival analysis was
somewhat different in the postsurgical advanced metastatic
setting. Similar to sunitinib or pazopanib, DC101 was seemingly devoid of activity, at least when used as monotherapy and
assessed by its impact on survival, because median survival was
64 to 65 days in both the control and DC101 treatment groups.
The paclitaxel monotherapy treatment showed a trend for a
survival beneﬁt (from 65 to 78 days) but this did not reach

2746

statistical signiﬁcance. However, median survival was significantly prolonged to 88 days in the combination treatment
group compared with control, untreated mice. The difference
in median survival between the DC101 þ paclitaxel group
(88 days) and the paclitaxel group (78 days) was not statistically
signiﬁcant, but would likely have led to a beneﬁt in PFS had we
been able to undertake such an assessment, and if so, would
mirror the results of the E2100 phase III trial. Taken together,
there does seem to be a modest beneﬁt in improving the
therapeutic impact of paclitaxel by combination with the
VEGF pathway targeting antibody, but not with sunitinib,
observations that seem to reﬂect previous phase III clinical
trial results (13, 16), including a head-to-head comparison of

sunitinib plus paclitaxel versus bevacizumab plus paclitaxel
(13) as well as the known modest to minimal PFS activity of
single-agent paclitaxel in metastatic triple-negative breast
cancer (16).
Several questions are raised by our results. First, what is the
basis for the widely divergent effects we have observed when
treating primary tumor-bearing mice versus mice with postsurgical advanced metastatic disease with antiangiogenic drugs?
Some possibilities include reduced expression of VEGF, or
VEGFR-2 in the tumor or tumor vasculature of established
metastases compared with the primary tumors. The qualitative
characteristics of the vasculature in the slightly "older" metastases may be substantially different from the primary tumors such
that there is a greater proportion of late/mature vessels that are
known to be less responsive to VEGF pathway targeting drugs
(21). Metastases in vasculature rich organs such as the lung and
liver may be more adept at co-opting the existing vasculature
than tumors growing in the mammary fat pad (22). Second,
would a similar pattern of results be observed if using GEMMs or
PDXs? With respect to GEMMs, surgical resection of the multiple
asynchronously arising primary tumors and the well-known
observed lack of distant metastases in most such models make
this difﬁcult to answer. Nevertheless, some GEMM primary
tumor therapy studies have shown a remarkable retrospective
correlation with prior phase III clinical trial PFS or OS results of

www.aacrjournals.org

the respective tumor types (lung and pancreatic cancer) in part
by using clinically relevant endpoints of tumor response (23).
As for PDXs, some recent studies have shown the presence of
metastases in clinically relevant patterns in nonresected primary
tumor-bearing patient-derived breast cancer xenografts obtained from patients with different breast cancer major subtypes
(24), thus making it possible to use these models for preclinical
adjuvant and metastatic therapy investigations.
Finally, is there any evidence that an investigational therapy
previously shown to be highly effective in the postsurgical
preclinical metastatic setting shows prospective clinical
activity? In this regard, we have reported that doublet oral
low-dose metronomic chemotherapy using cyclophosphamide
and a 5-ﬂuorouracil prodrug (UFT), that is, tegafur þ uracil,
had potent activity in the postsurgical metastatic setting using
the LM2-4 breast cancer model (9), whereas the activity was
much less impressive when treating primary tumors in control
unresected mice (9). A similar version of this metronomic
chemotherapy was tested in phase II MBC trial, in combination
with bevacizumab, with very encouraging results (25). However, as discussed in the Introduction, such phase II trial results
have to be conﬁrmed in a larger randomized phase III trial,
of which one is underway evaluating metronomic doublet
cyclophosphamide and capecitabine with bevacizumab
(NCT01131195; www.clinicaltrials.gov). Nevertheless, for now,

our results suggest the value of preclinical modeling postsurgical advanced metastatic disease as a potential strategy to
improve how they might predict clinical outcomes. The same
may be the case for postsurgical adjuvant therapy models of
early stage microscopic (minimal residual) metastatic disease,
which can also respond to therapy in a manner different from
primary tumors in control experiments (19, 26). Although not
practical for routine drug screening, use of such models may be
useful to conﬁrm prior preclinical studies using conventional
primary tumor therapy models, before embarking on expensive
phase II or III metastatic therapy clinical trials.
