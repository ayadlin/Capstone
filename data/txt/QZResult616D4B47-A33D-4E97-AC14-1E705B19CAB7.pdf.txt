ABSTRACT
Abnormal expression and function of retinoic acid receptor α (RARα) have
been reported to be associated with various cancers including acute promyelocytic
leukemia and hepatocellular carcinoma. However, the role and the mechanism of
RARα in gastric carcinoma (GC) were unknown. Here, the expression of RARα was
frequently elevated in human GC tissues and cell lines, and its overexpression was
closely correlated with tumor size, lymph node metastasis and clinical stages in GC
patients. Moreover, RARα overexpression was related with pathological differentiation.
Functionally, RARα knockdown inhibited the proliferation and metastasis of GC
cells, as well as enhanced drug susceptibility both in vitro and in vivo. Additionally,
RARα knockdown suppressed GC progression through regulating the expression of
cell proliferation, cell cycle, invasion and drug resistance associated proteins, such
as PCNA, CyclinB1, CyclinD2, CyclinE, p21, MMP9 and MDR1. Mechanistically, the
above oncogenic properties of RARα in GC were closely associated with Akt signaling
activation. Moreover, overexpression of RARα was induced by IL-1β/Akt signaling
activation, which suggested a positive feedback loop of IL-1β/Akt/RARα/Akt signaling
in GC. Taken together, we demonstrated that RARα was frequently elevated in GC
and exerted oncogenic properties. It might be a potential molecular target for GC
treatment.

Retinoids including vitamin A and retinoic acid
derivatives have profound effect on embryogenesis,
differentiation, and carcinogenesis [3, 4]. These biological
activities of retinoids are mediated by retinoic acid receptors
(RARs) and retinoid X receptors (RXRs) two classes of
specific nuclear retinoid receptors in the steroid/thyroid
hormone family. RAR consist of three distinct receptor
subtypes: α, β, and γ [5, 6]. Among them, increasing lines of
evidence have implied that aberrant expression of RARα may
play critical roles in carcinogenesis. For example, in acute
promyelocytic leukemia patients, the RARα gene is fused

INTRODUCTION
Gastric carcinoma (GC) is ranked as the second most
common cancer and is the leading cause of cancer-related
deaths in the world [1]. Current available therapeutic
methods for GC, such as surgical excision, chemotherapy
and chemoembolization, are less optimal especially in late
stage of patients [2]. Therefore, it is urgent to understand
the molecular mechanisms underlying GC progression so
as to develop novel molecular targets for more effective
therapies.

with a number of alternative partner genes such as PML,
promyelocytic leukemia zinc finger [7] and nucleophosmin
[8]. RARα has been identified as highly expressed in
hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and is possibly responsible
for abnormal growth of HCC [9]. However, the role and
mechanism of RARα in GC remain unknown.
It is widely recognized that infection with
Helicobacter pylori plays a crucial role in the initiation and
progression of GC [10]. In recent years, the significance of
chronic inflammation in carcinogenesis has gained more
and more attention [11]. Such inflammatory response
seems to be regulated by many proinflammatory cytokines,
that can have autocrine, paracrine and endocrine effects.
Interlenkin-1β (IL-1β) is a member of proinflammatory
cytokine family which are produced by both tumor cells
and stromal cells [12]. It has been reported to govern the
proliferation and invasion related proteins of GC [13, 14].
Nevertheless, whether IL-1β regulates RARα expression
in development and progression of GC is unclear.
Cytokine and other growth factors such as insulin,
epidermal growth factor and vascular endothelial growth
factor can trigger the activation of signaling pathway
including phosphatidylinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt
through binding to their cell surface receptors. Moreover,
PI3K/Akt signaling pathway regulates a variety of
cellular activities, in particular, previous reports have
indicated it has participated in tumorigenesis and tumor
progression by promoting cell proliferation [15, 16]. In
GC, phosphorylated Akt (p-Akt) expression may not only
be useful for predicting the prognosis and efficacy of
fluorouracil treatment [17], and also reflect the grade of
malignancy in human gastric adenocarcinomas [18]. PI3K/
Akt signaling is required for the attachment and spreading
and growth in vivo of metastatic scirrhous GC as well [19].
However, whether the regulation of PI3K/Akt signaling
links RARα and GC remains undefined.
In the present study, we found that the expression
of RARα was highly expressed in both GC patients and
cell lines. Moreover, RARα level is significantly related
with the progression of GC. Knockdown of RARα
could suppress PI3K/Akt signaling, leading to inhibition
metastatic abilities and increasing drug susceptibility
of GC cells. Futhermore, the proinflammation cytokine
IL-1β could induce overexpression of RARα through
activation of PI3K/Akt signaling. Thus, we identify a
positive feedback loop of IL-1β/Akt/RARα/Akt signaling,
suggesting an oncogenic potential of RARα involved in
the development of GC.

revealed that the mRNA and protein levels of RARα were
significantly elevated in T tissues compared with that in
P tissues (Figure 1A-1B). More samples from a cohort of
180 GC patients in tissue microarray were subjected to
evaluate the expression and clinical significance of RARα
in GC. The IHC results showed that RARα protein was
strongly expressed in T tissues, presented dominantly in
cytoplasm of tumor cells, but was weakly or not stained in
P tissues (Figure 1C). In order to investigate the level of
RARα in these two tissues, the staining intensity of RARα
was divided into low (- to +) or high (++ to +++) groups
(Figure 1D). As shown in Table 1, the high expression rate
of RARα in T tissues was 58%, which was much higher
compared with the 6.25% in P tissues.
Clinicopathological analysis revealed that
overexpression of RARα was strongly correlated with
tumor diameter, lymph node metastasis and clinical stages
in GC patients (Table 2). Meanwhile RARα overexpression
was related with pathological differentiation. Furthermore,
Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that GC patients with high
RARα expression had shorter median survival time (22
months) than that of low RARα expression patients (32
months), but there was no statistical significance between
the two groups (P > 0.05) (Figure 1E). Taken together,
these results indicated that abnormal overexpression of
RARα might be associated with the development of GC.

Construction of RARα knockdown cell model in
GC cell lines
To further determine the aberrant expression pattern
of RARα in GC, three GC cell lines (BGC-823, SGC-7901,
and MGC-803) and a normal human gastric epithelial cell
line GES-1were subjected to detect the level of RARα.
As shown in Figure 2A-2B, the mRNA and protein levels
of RARα in three GC cell lines were markedly higher
than those of GES-1 cell lines. Moreover, overexpression
of RARα was primarily localized in the cytoplasm of
GC cells, that was consistent with the IHC results from
clinical GC tissues (Figure 2C). In order to characterize
the functional role of RARα in the development of GC,
RARα was downregulated by stably transducing with
shRARα-expressing lentiviruses. As shown in Figure 2D2F, the mRNA and protein levels of RARα in shRARαBGC-823 or SGC-7901 cells were much lower than those
in their respective control cells, indicating that RARα was
effectively knockdown.

Inhibitory effects of RARα knockdown on
proliferation of GC cells

RESULTS

To characterize the biological effect of RARα
knockdown on the proliferation of GC cells in vitro, MTT
and colony formation assay were performed. Compared
with the control cells (Figure 3A), the proliferation of both
shRARα-BGC-823 and shRARα-SGC-7901 cells were
significantly reduced from day 3. Moreover, colonies of

shRARα-BGC-823 and shRARα-SGC-7901 cells were
fewer and relatively smaller in size, compared with their
relative shCtrl cells (Figure 3B).
The tumorigenic potential of RARα was also
evaluated by xenograft tumor in nude mice. As shown in
Figure 3C, the growth of shRARα-BGC-823 xenografts
were slower from day 6 compared with that of shCtrl
group. The average tumor weight of shRARα-BGC-823

xenografts was 0.59 ± 0.05 g, which was significantly
lower than that of shCtrl group (0.98 ± 0.08 g). In addition,
significant reduction of proliferation marker PCNA was
observed in shRARα-BGC-823 xenografts (Figure 3D).
Taken together, these results suggested that RARα might
be critical for oncogenic property of GC cells.

RARα knockdown (Figure 4A).
Multidrug resistance is frequently induced during
chemotherapy. The effect of RARα knockdown on the
drug susceptibility of GC cells was investigated in vitro
and in vivo. As shown in Figure 4B, MTT assays revealed

in both BGC-823 and SGC-7901 cells. Furthermore, the

that of control group (49.2 ± 4.2%) (Figure 4C). These

showed a significant reduction in migration of shRARα

proportion of cells in the G1 phase were detected in RARα
knockdown, and accordingly, the fractions of cells in the
S phase decreased (Figure 5A and Supplementary Figure
1). Western blot analysis showed that after silencing of
RARα, the expression of PCNA, CyclinB1, CyclinD2,
and CyclinE was decreased, whereas p21 expression
was augmented compared to the control (Figure 5B). In
addition, MMP9 and MDR1 have been recognized as
critical invasion and drug resistance makers, respectively.

As shown in Figure 5B, the expression levels of MMP9
and MDR1 were inhibited after downregulation of RARα.
RARα could interact with p85α of PI3K subunits
to activate PI3K/Akt signaling [20], which played an
important role in the development of GC including
regulation of cell cycle [21]. Consistent with previous
studies, we found that knockdown of RARα suppressed
the phosphorylation level of Akt at serine 473 (S473)
and threonine 308 (T308) (Figure 5B). In contrast,
overexpression of RARα strongly increased the level of
p-Akt at S473 and T308 and this effect could be retarded
by LY294002, the specific inhibitor for PI3K/Akt signaling

(Figure 5C). Meanwhile, LY294002 could reverse the
effect of RARα overexpression on the expression of
PCNA, CyclinB1, CyclinD2, CyclinE, p21, MMP9
and MDR1 (Figure 5C), which indicated that RARα
might regulate the cell development and progression via
activation of PI3K/Akt signaling.

hypothesized that the infiltration of inflammatory factors,
an important feature of the tumor microenvironment,
lead to the overexpression of RARα. During screening
experiments, we found that IL-1β, an important
proinflammatory cytokine, increased the level of RARα
protein in a dose-dependent manner in both BGC-823
and SGC-7901 cells (Figure 6A), whereas TNFα and
IL-6 failed to alter RARα expression significantly in
GC cells (Supplementary Figure 2). Furthermore, IL1β activated the PI3K/Akt signaling via enhancing the
phosphorylation of Akt at S473 and T308 (Figure 6B).
Meanwhile, overexpression of RARα induced by IL-1β
could be reversed by the PI3K/Akt inhibitor LY294002
(Figure 6C), indicating that Akt signaling is essential for
IL-1β-upregulated RARα. Hence, these data suggested the
existence of a positive feedback loop of IL-1β/Akt/RARα/
Akt signaling in the development of GC (Figure 6D).

RARα and PI3K/Akt signaling in the growth of GC cells.
Our data showed that the phosphorylation of Akt was
suppressed by downregulation of RARα, and enhanced by
upregulation of RARα. Moreover, RARα overexpression
increased the level of PCNA, CyclinB1, CyclinD2,
CyclinE MMP9 and MDR1 as well as decreased p21
expression. And this could be reversed by LY294002, the
specific inhibitor for PI3K/Akt signaling, suggesting that
RARα might regulate PI3K/Akt signaling to promote the
progression of GC.
In the present study, we showed that RARα localized
majorly in the cytoplasm of clinical samples and cell lines,
which was consistent with RARγ. Previous studies have
shown that overexpressed RARγ could translocate to the
cytoplasm in HCC and cholangiocarcinoma [27, 28].
Altered subcellular localization of RARγ was associated
with its oncogenic effects. In addition, RARγ could
interact with p85α and β-catenin, that may retain RARγ in
the cytoplasm [27, 28].
The cause and mechanism of abnormal RARα
overexpression in malignant tumors have not yet been
studied. Inflammation of stomach mucosa has been
regarded as a key cause of gastric carcinogenesis, and the
presence of proinflammatory cytokines can regulate specific
genes participated in the process of GC. IL-1β, serving as a
known proinflammatory cytokine, can activate MUC2 gene
involved in the gastric neoplassic transformation [29]. Some
studies indicated that IL-1β can trigger the activation of
both Akt pathway and NF-κB pathway, which appears to be
important molecular links between inflammation and tumor
[30, 31]. In the present study, we found that IL-1β and not
TNFα or IL-6 exerted potent effects on the expression of
RARα. IL-1β could enhance RARα overexpression in a
dose-dependent manner. In addition, after co-incubation
with IL-1β, the phosphorylation of Akt was enhanced.
LY294002 inhibited the upregulation of RARα induced by
IL-1β, suggesting that IL-1β upregulated RARα via Akt
signaling. It is likely that overexpression of RARα promoted
GC progression via Akt signaling and this further formed a
positive feedback of IL-1β/Akt/RARα/Akt signaling.
In conclusion, our study identified RARα
as a potential oncogene in the progression of GC.
Overexpression of RARα might promote the progression
of GC cells through forming the positive feedback of
IL-1β/Akt/RARα/Akt signaling. Therefore, our findings
are potentially beneficial for the future development of
promising target against malignant progression of GC.

DISCUSSION
Multiple lines of evidence presented here
identified an aberrant expression of RARα in providing
oncogenic cues that promote GC tumorigenesis. We not
only validated the frequent upregulation of RARα in
clinical GC specimens and its clinical significance, and
also demonstrated the oncogenic property of RARα in
proliferation, metastasis and drug susceptibility of GC
cells through Akt signaling. Our results suggested that
targeting RARα might be a potentially beneficial for
treatment of GC.
RARα has been characterized as an oncogene in
the development of various tumors. Its overexpression
disrupted normal acinar structure and induced epithelial to
mesenchymal transition during mammary tumorigenesis
[22]. RARα is also required for efficient estrogen receptor
α mediated transcription and cell proliferation in breast
cancer [23]. Our current study showed that, downregulation
of RARα inhibited GC growth and increased drug
susceptibility both in vitro and in vivo, as well as decreased
metastasis in vitro. RARα knockdown resulted in cell cycle
arrest at G1 phase accompanying with the reduction of S
phase. In addition, silencing RARα inhibited the expression
of PCNA, CyclinB1, CyclinD2, CyclinE, MMP9 and
MDR1 and enhanced p21 expression, that may play critical
roles in tumor growth, invasion, drug resistance. All results
came to a conclusion that RARα regulate the development
and progression of GC in a form of oncogene.
Molecular studies provided evidences that, RARs
including RARα could interact with p85α in various cell
types thus activate the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway [24,
25]. PI3Ks can be divided into three classes according to
structure and function, termed as class I, II and III. Class
IA PI3Ks consists of regulatory and catalytic subunits.
P85α, a regulatory subunit of class IA PI3Ks, appears
to be a phosphoprotein substrate of many cytoplasmic
and receptor tyrosine kinases [26]. We further evaluated
the biological significance of the regulation between

(> 5 cm distant from the edges of tumor; T = P, n =
21) specimens of GC patients, who had undergone a
gastrectomy between 2013 and 2015, were collected
at the First Affiliated Hospital of Xiamen University.
Tissue microarray of human GC was purchased from
National SOBC Biobank, which included 100 GC
specimens, 80 samples of paired paracarcinoma tissues.
The clinicopathological data are summarized in Table 2
including age, sex, pathological diferentiation, tumor

Cell lysates were separated by SDS–PAGE
and transferred to a PVDF membrane as previously
described [33]. After incubation with primary and
secondary antibodies, the membranes were washed in
PBST. Then signals were detected with an enhanced
chemiluminescence system.

assay, cells were treated with various concentrations of
5-FU, DDP, L-OHP and DOC for 48 hours. Then 20 μl
MTT (5mg/ml) was added to each well and incubated at
37°C for 4 hours. The medium was removed and formazan
crystals were dissolved in DMSO. The optical density
(OD) was measured at 490 nm using a microplate reader.

cells GES-1 were supplied by Key Laboratory of the
First Affiliated Hospital of Xiamen University. The cells
cultured in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% FBS,
100 U/ml penicillin at 37°C in an atmosphere of 5% CO2
and humidified incubator. For establishment of RARα
knockdown cell lines, 293T cells were cotransfected with
target plasmids and the packaging plasmids according
to the manufacturer’s instructions. Viral supernatants
including infectious lentiviral particles were harvested
after transfection day 2, and then added in BGC-823 and
SGC-7901culture. After infection, cells were selected in
500 μg/ml G418 for 2 weeks.

Cell cycle analysis
The effect of RARα knockdown on cell cycle
progression was determined by flow cytometry. The
thymidine-synchronized cells were collected after G1
block. Then the cells were digested and centrifuged at
800 rpm for 10 min. After fixation in 70% ethanol at 4°C
overnight, the cells were stained with PI solution (50 μg/
ml PI and 100μg/ml RNase A in PBS) for detection.

Colony formation assay
Cells were seeded at a density of 500 cells per
well in six well plates and incubated for 14 days to form
colonies. The cells were washed with PBS and stained
with crystal violet. The number of colonies was counted
using an inverse microscope. The experiments were
carried out at least three times.

Immunohistochemistry (IHC) and
immunocytochemistry (ICC)
IHC and ICC were performed as previously
described [32]. Tissue microarray and slides of cells were
reacted with primary antibody to RARα (1:100) at 4°C for

Tumor xenografts
BGC-823 stablely transfected with vectors
downregulating RARα or the control vectors were
subcutaneously injected into the right oxter of 6 weeks
old male BALB/c athymic nude mice for 18 days. Tumor
volumes and weights were measured as previously
described [28]. For drug susceptibility experiment,
5-FU (20 mg/kg) was administrated via intraperitoneally
injection when tumor volumes were about 50 mm3. At
the end of the 2 week dosing schedule, the mice were
sacrificed with CO2 inhalation. Ethical approval was
obtained from the Animal Care and Use Committee of the
First Affiliated Hospital of Xiamen University before the
beginning of experiments.

Cell migration and invasion assay were detected by
transwell assays. Cells were seeded in the upper chambers
in serum-free media with or without the Matrigel
membrane for 48 hour. Then cells migrating through the
membrane were counted after they were stained with
crystal violet.

Statistical analysis
SPSS16.0 statistical software package (SPSS
Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) was used to analyse statistical
date. Data were expressed as mean ± SEM from at least
three independent experiments. Statistics was evaluated
using Student's t test or ANOVA analysis. IHC on tissue
microarrays was analyzed by Pearson’s χ2 test, and the
survival rate was calculated by the Kaplan-Meier method.
The data were regarded as significant when the P value
was less than 0.05.
