Abstract
Progastrin (PG) exerts proliferative and antiapoptotic effects
on intestinal epithelial and colon cancer cells via Annexin II
(ANX-II). In here, we show that ANX-II similarly mediates
proliferative and antiapoptotic effects of PG on a pancreatic
cancer cell line, AR42J. The role of several signaling molecules
was examined in delineating the biological activity of PG. PG
(0.1–1.0 nmol/L) caused a significant increase (2- to 5-fold) in
the phosphorylation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K),
Akt (Thr308), p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK;
Thr180/Tyr182), extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK;
Thr202/Tyr204), IKB kinase A/B (IKKA/B; Ser176/180), IKBA
(Ser32), and p65 nuclear factor-KB (NF-KB; Ser536). Inhibition
of p44/42 ERKs (PD98059), p38 MAPK (SB203580), Akt, and
PI3K (LY294002), individually or combined, partially reversed
antiapoptotic effects of PG. The kinetics of phosphorylation of
IKKA/B in response to PG matched the kinetics of phosphorylation and degradation of IKBA and correlated with
phosphorylation, nuclear translocation, and activation of
p65 NF-KB. NF-KB essential modulator–binding domain
peptide (an inhibitor of IKKA/B) effectively blocked the
activity of p65 NF-KB in response to PG. Activation of p65
NF-KB, in response to PG, was 70% to 80% dependent on
phosphorylation of MAPK/ERK and PI3K/Akt molecules.
Down-regulation of p65 NF-KB by specific small interfering
RNA resulted in the loss of antiapoptotic effects of PG on
AR42J cells. These studies show for the first time that the
canonical pathway of activation of p65 NF-KB mediates
antiapoptotic effects of PG. Therefore, targeting PG and/or
p65 NF-KB may be useful for treating cancers, which are
dependent on autocrine or circulating PGs for their growth.

Introduction
The full-length progastrin1-80 peptide (PG) is the precursor
peptide of gastrin (G1-G17). G17 plays an important role in gastric
acid secretion via CCK2R (1). Additionally, PG and gastrin peptides
exert growth effects on normal and cancerous intestinal epithelial
cells (IEC) via PG-preferring receptors (2–5). We now know that
colorectal cancers (CRC) express autocrine PG (2). Besides CRCs,

pancreatic cancer (6), lung cancer (7), and ovarian cancer (8) also
express the gastrin gene and PGs. It is possible that PG-like
peptides play an equally important role in the growth and survival
of many of these PG-expressing cancers as reported for PGdependent CRCs (2, 9). Therefore, understanding the mechanisms
by which PG-like peptides mediate growth and survival effects on
cancer cells will be extremely useful in developing a targeted
approach for treating PG-dependent cancer as previously discussed
(2, 9, 10). The high-affinity PG/gastrin-binding sites are distinct
from CCK1R and CCK2R and bind PG-like peptides in the order of
PG>Gly gastrin>G17>CCK8 (3). Annexin II (ANX-II) was recently
discovered as one such molecule and is required for mediating
growth factor effects of PG/gastrin peptides on intestinal epithelial
and colon cancer cells (11). Although high-affinity binding sites for
PG-like peptides are present on normal IECs, and on gastrinresponsive CRCs, it is not known if high-affinity PG-binding sites
are present on other cancer cell types as well. We used a rat
pancreatic cancer cell line, AR42J, as the in vitro pancreatic cancer
cell model. AR42J cells, unlike human pancreatic cancer cell lines,
do not express autocrine growth factors and/or elevated levels of
growth-promoting factors [such as nuclear factor-nB (NF-nB) or
mutant Ras] and are responsive to exogenous G17/Gly gastrin
(reviewed in ref. 2). In initial studies, we confirmed if AR42J cells
were positive for high-affinity PG-binding sites and if the cells
expressed ANX-II. Next, we confirmed if AR42J cells respond to
proliferative and antiapoptotic effects of PG and if ANX-II mediates
growth effects of PG on AR42J cells.
Activation of c-Src kinase is required for mediating proliferative
effects of PG on IECs (12). In mice overexpressing PG (hGAS
mice), significant increases in the relative levels of phosphorylated
c-Src, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt, Janus-activated
kinase (JAK) 2, signal transducers and activators of transcription
(STAT) 3, extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK), and transforming growth factor-a in colonic mucosa were reported (13),
suggesting that one or more of these signaling molecules may be
involved in mediating proliferative and/or antiapoptotic effects of
PG. In fact, several of these molecules, including p38 mitogenactivated protein kinase (MAPK)/ERK p44/42 and PI3K/Akt, have
been shown to play an important role in proliferation and
survival of pancreatic cancer cells (14–16). Additionally, activation
of NF-nB has been reported to be one of the most frequent
molecular alterations in pancreatic cancer cells (14) and is
required for the proliferation and survival of the cells (14, 17).
Importantly, down-regulation of NF-nB sensitizes the pancreatic
cancer cells to apoptotic death via anticancer agents (14, 18, 19).
We therefore focused on examining the role of the above-listed
signaling molecules in mediating the observed survival effects of
PG on AR42J cells. As a result of our studies, we report for the
first time that PG exerts potent antiapoptotic effects on AR42J

cells, which are mediated by the phosphorylation of InB kinase
(IKK) a/h, resulting in the degradation of InBa and activation of
p65 NF-nB; activation of NF-nB pathway seems to be 70% to 80%
dependent on the phosphorylation (activation) of p38 MAPK/ERK
and PI3K/Akt.

Figure 2. A –D, PG treatment stimulates degradation of InBa and increases phosphorylation of NF-nB p65 in the cellular and nuclear compartments. AR42J
cells were treated with 0.1 nmol/L PG for increasing times from 3 to 48 h. At the end of the treatment, cells were processed for Western blot analysis with specific
antibodies. A, samples were probed with antibodies against total InBa and reprobed with anti-h-actin antibodies. Top, representative autoradiographs of Western blot

were processed for measuring phosphorylated NF-nB (Ser536) in either the cellular lysates (B ) or the nucleus (C ). For nuclear samples, relative levels of h-actin
in the nucleus were measured as an internal control. A set of samples in (B) was additionally pretreated with or without NEMO (an inhibitor of IKKa/h) for 1 h as indicated
in Fig. 2D . B –D, top, representative autoradiographs from one of three separate experiments. The signal intensity of the bands was determined densitometrically

cell count assay or in a MTT assay as described previously (4). To examine
the effect of anti-PG antibodies, 0.1 nmol/L rhPG was preincubated with
the antibody for 1 h before adding to the cells. In preliminary studies, we
first confirmed the presence of significant levels of ANX-II protein in AR42J
cells by Western blot analysis; significant levels of ANX-II were measured
(data not shown) as previously reported for IEC and colon cancer cells (11).
To examine the effect of receptor antibodies (including ANX-II), cells plated
in the wells were preincubated with either anti-ANX-II or anti-CCK2R
antibodies for 1 to 2 h; control cells were treated with an equal amount
of nonimmune IgG followed by the addition of 0.1 nmol/L rhPG for
48 to 72 h.
Treatment of AR42J cells for measuring surrogate markers of
apoptosis. Cells were cultured in 35-mm dishes as described previously
(5). For measuring surrogate markers of apoptosis (relative levels of
activated caspase-3 and caspase-9), cells were additionally treated for
5 h with the proapoptotic agent (camptothecin) as described (5). At the
end of the treatment, cells were processed for measuring relative levels
of activated caspase-3 and caspase-9 by Western immunoblot analysis as
described (5). In a few experiments, cells were preincubated for 1 h with PP3
(20 Amol/L), LY294002 (20 Amol/L), Akt inhibitor (20 Amol/L), SB203580
(10 Amol/L), PD98059 (20 Amol/L), NEMO (200 Amol/L), and caspase-3
inhibitor I (200 Amol/L) before stimulating with rhPG as described in the
figure legends.
Preparation of cellular lysates and crude nuclear extracts for
Western blot analysis. Crude nuclear extracts were prepared from AR42J

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (15). August 1, 2007

cells on the indicated days of cell culture using Nuclear Extract kit from
Active Motif as per the instructions of the manufacturer. Cellular lysates
and nuclear extracts were prepared from control and PG-treated AR42J
cells as described previously (12). The samples were processed for Western
immunoblot analysis with the indicated antibodies by our published
methods (5, 12). All the primary antibodies were used at a dilution of
1:1,000. The antigen-antibody complexes were detected using chemiluminescence reagent kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). To confirm
equivalent loading, membranes were stripped and reprobed with either
anti-h-actin antibody or an antibody that detects the total amount of the
indicated kinase as internal controls. The relative density of the bands was
densitometrically analyzed.
Binding affinity and relative binding affinity of peptides for 125I
rhPG-binding sites. The full-length rhPG was radiolabeled with Na125I
(Amersham), and intact 125I-rhPG was purified by high-performance liquid
chromatography as described previously (3). The binding affinity was
obtained from binding assay data as described previously (3, 4). The relative
binding affinity (RBA) of gastrin-like peptides for displacing specific binding
of rhPG was determined as described previously (3, 4). 125I-Bolton HunterCCK8 (125I-BH-CCK8; Amersham Biosciences) was also used as the
radiolabeled ligand, and the RBA of gastrin-like peptides for displacing
the binding of 125I-BH-CCK8 to AR42J cells was examined by our published
methods (4).

was examined using TransAM p65 NF-nB Chemi Transcription Factor
Assay kit from Active Motif as per the instructions of the manufacturer.
Briefly, 30 AL of complete binding buffer were added into each well coated
with immobilized oligonucleotide containing the NF-nB consensus site
(5¶-GGGACTTTCC-3¶). Nuclear proteins (20 AL), prepared from cells
incubated with or without rhPG for different times, were added to the
wells in 80 AL complete lysis buffer and incubated for 1 h at room
temperature. The wells were washed and incubated with anti-p65 NF-nB
antibody (1:1,000 dilution) for 1 h and washed thrice again followed by
incubation with horseradish peroxidase–conjugated second antibody
(1:10,000; 50 AL) for 1 h. The wells were washed four times followed by
the addition of the chemiluminescent working solution. The resulting
chemiluminescence, proportional to the levels of nuclear p65 NF-nB,
bound to the consensus sequence, was measured with a luminometer
(Dinex Technologies) by our published methods (23).
Promoter-reporter assay to verify the transcriptional activity of p65
NF-KB. A promoter-reporter plasmid (2 mg), which had three copies of the
interleukin-8 (IL-8) promoter fragment containing RelA/NF-kB1–binding
site, cloned upstream of an inert TATA box driving the expression of firefly
luciferase (IL-8nBE)3-p59rAT/LUC (Invitrogen Life Technologies), was
transfected in the cells by our published methods (23, 24). Twenty-four
hours after transfection, the cells were treated with or without rhPG
(0.1 nmol/L) for 6 h (optimal for measuring maximum activity of nuclear
NF-nB as determined from previous experiments). Cells were lysed to
measure luciferase levels by our published methods (23, 24).
Down-regulation of p65 NF-KB by small interfering RNA for
examining the role of p65 NF-KB in mediating the antiapoptotic
effects of PG on AR42J cells. p65 NF-nB small interfering RNA (siRNA;
from Dharmacon) was used. AR42J cells were seeded in 35-mm dishes and
incubated at 37jC for 24 h followed by growth in serum- and antibiotic-free
medium for 24 h. The cells were then transfected with either 100 nmol/L
p65 NF-nB siRNA construct or a negative control siRNA construct
(Dharmacon) using 4 AL DharmaFECT transfection reagent 4 (Dharmacon).
After 48 h, the siRNA-transfected cells were treated with or without
0.1 nmol/L PG for 48 h. The cells were treated with 10 Amol/L camptothecin for 4 h for inducing apoptosis. Total cellular proteins were
extracted from camptothecin-treated cells, and relative levels of p65 NF-nB
and activated caspase-3 were measured by Western immunoblot analysis as
described above.
Cell death assay to measure the loss of antiapoptotic effects of PG in
the presence of kinase inhibitors. A Cell Death Detection ELISAPLUS kit
(Roche) was used for these studies as published (5). Briefly, AR42J cells were
seeded in 35-mm dishes (0.5  104) and incubated at 37jC for 24 h followed
by growth in serum-free medium for 24 h. Specific kinase inhibitors were
added either alone or in combinations for 1 h followed by the addition of
0.1 nmol/L PG for 48 h. The proapoptotic agent camptothecin (10 Amol/L)
was added at the end of the incubation for 4 h. The cells were processed
as per the instructions of the supplier. The relative levels of cell death in the
various samples were obtained from spectrophotometric readings of the
wells at 405 nm.
Statistical analysis. Data are presented as the mean F SE of values
obtained from four to eight samples/two to three experiments. To test for
significant differences between means, the nonparametric Mann-Whitney
test was used using StatView 4.1 (Abacus Concepts); P values were
considered to be statistically significant if <0.05.

Results
Growth and antiapoptotic effects of PG on AR42J cells:
presence of high-affinity binding sites (ANX-II) on AR42J cells.
Dose-dependent effects of PG (0.1–1,000 nmol/L) were examined on
the growth of AR42J cells in vitro. A biphasic response was measured, wherein the growth of AR42J cells was significantly increased (by
>60–70%) in response to low concentrations (0.1–1.0 nmol/L) of PG,
whereas a loss or no change in growth was measured at higher
concentrations of 10 nmol/L to 1.0 Amol/L (Fig. 1A). In previous

www.aacrjournals.org

studies, we have similarly reported biphasic effects of PG and
gastrin peptides on the growth of IECs (3). We therefore used
0.1 nmol/L PG as an optimal dose for all further studies.
Previously, we showed potent antiapoptotic effects of PG on IEC
cells (5) and colon cancer cells (25). In the current studies, PG was
found to similarly exert potent antiapoptotic effect on AR42J cells;
camptothecin-induced activation of caspase-3 and caspase-9 was
significantly reduced by >70% to 80% in the presence of 0.1 nmol/L
PG (Fig. 1Bi and Bii).
Several investigators have shown that PG peptides exert growth
effects on target cells via novel binding sites that are distinct
from CCK2R (2). Because CCK2R are expressed at high concentrations on AR42J cells (4, 26), in the current study, we established
the RBA of gastrin-like peptides (PG, G17, and CCK) for the highaffinity CCK receptors and the high-affinity PG-binding receptors.
PG dose dependently displaced the binding of radiolabeled rhPG
(Fig. 1Ci) but was largely ineffective in displacing the binding
of radiolabeled 125I-BH-CCK8 to CCK2R on AR42J cells (Fig. 1Cii).
On the other hand, CCK and G17, both of which bind CCK2R
with high affinity (4, 26), showed a negligible binding affinity for
PG-binding sites (Fig. 1Ci) but completely displaced binding of
125
I-BH-CCK8 (Fig. 1Cii). Recently, we discovered that ANX-II
molecules serve the role of high-affinity PG-binding sites (11). To
confirm the role of ANX-II in mediating growth effects of PG on
AR42J cells, we examined the effect of anti-ANX-II and antiCCK2R antibodies (Fig. 1D). Anti-PG antibodies and anti-ANX-II
antibodies significantly reduced growth of PG-stimulated AR42 J
cells to control levels, confirming a direct role of ANX-II and PG
in the observed effects (Fig. 1D); treatment of cells with antiCCK2R antibodies had statistically insignificant effects on PGstimulated growth of AR42J cells (Fig. 1D). The binding affinity of
rhPG for AR42J cells was determined by Scatchard analysis to be
in the range of 0.1 to 0.5 nmol/L (data not shown) as previously
reported for IEC cells (3).

times. At the end of the treatment period, the cells were processed for the
preparation of nuclear protein extracts. The presence of activated NF-nB p65
in the nuclear extracts was examined with the TransAM NF-nB p65 Chemi
Transcription Factor Assay kit. The readout for the DNA binding assay was
measured in chemiluminescence units, and the readings for control nontreated
samples at 0 time point was arbitrarily assigned a 100% value. As a positive
control, nuclear extracts were also prepared from AR42J cells stimulated with
25 ng TNF-a/mL medium for 30 min. The chemiluminescence units measured for
samples treated with either TNF-a or with PG for increasing time points are
presented as a % change from the control 0.0 values. Columns, mean of data

PI3K, we used a phosphotyrosine p85 PI3K-binding motif antibody
that binds to tyrosine-phosphorylated YXXM motif, is recognized
by p85, and docks PI3K to the membrane resulting in activation of
the kinase. As can be seen from Supplementary Fig. S1A to E,
phosphorylation of all the indicated kinases examined in this study
was significantly increased by approximately 2- to 5-fold in AR42J
cells in response to PG. In all cases, the relative levels of
phosphorylated kinases were corrected for the total levels of the
corresponding kinase. The phosphorylation moieties examined are
detailed in the legend of Supplementary Fig. S1.

survival effects of PG in the presence of the indicated inhibitors in
response to the proapoptotic agent camptothecin (Supplementary
Fig. S2). Treatment with inhibitors of ERKs, MAPK, Akt, and PI3K
significantly reversed the antiapoptotic effects of PG by f70%,
f60%, f45%, and f30%, respectively, indicating that MAPK/ERK
and PI3K/Akt kinases are involved in mediating antiapoptotic
effects of PG. Interestingly, inhibition of MAPK or ERK activity was
more effective than inhibition of PI3K/Akt in reversing the
antiapoptotic effects of PG (Supplementary Fig. S2).
PG stimulates phosphorylation of IKKA/B, IKBA, NF-KB,
and translocation of NF-KB into the nucleus of AR42J cells.
Because activation of MAPK/ERKs and PI3K/Akt is reported to
result in activation of NF-nB (27), we next examined if NF-nB is
activated in response to PG via the canonical pathway involving
phosphorylation of IKKa/h and degradation of InBa (27–30).
Treatment of AR42J cells with 0.1 nmol/L PG resulted in a
significant increase in the phosphorylated levels of IKKa/h, after

6 to 36 h of stimulation, with a peak at 6 h (Supplementary Table
S1A). The relative levels of phosphorylated InBa were also
significantly increased by approximately 2- to 3-fold after 6 h of
PG stimulation, and these levels remained elevated until 36 h after
stimulation (Supplementary Table S1B). As expected, increased
phosphorylation of InBa was associated with a significant decline in
the relative levels of total InBa by 6 h of PG stimulation, and the
levels of total InBa remained significantly low until f48 h after PG
stimulation (Fig. 2A). In association with the degradation of InBa,
a significant increase in phosphorylation of cellular p65 NF-nB was
measured in response to PG, which once again peaked at 6 h after
PG stimulation (Fig. 2B). A significant increase in total nuclear
NF-nB (Supplementary Table S1C) and in relative levels of phosphorylated NF-nB (Fig. 2C) was measured in the nuclear fraction of
AR42J cells after 6 h of stimulation with 0.1 nmol/L PG; the increase
in nuclear NF-nB remained elevated until f48 h after PG treatment,
suggesting a sustained phosphorylation of p65 NF-nB in response
to PG (Fig. 2C). In the presence of NEMO-binding peptide, which
inhibits the activation of IKKa/h (31), phosphorylation of p65
NF-nB in response to PG at 6 h was reduced to control levels (Fig. 2D).
PG stimulates the activation of p65 NF-KB as measured in
DNA-binding assays. To confirm functional activation of nuclear

p65 NF-nB, binding of nuclear proteins to nB sites in an in vitro
DNA-binding assay was conducted as described in Materials and
Methods. A significant increase in the binding of nuclear protein
(NF-nB) was measured at 6 h after PG stimulation, which was f4fold higher than that in control samples and f1/2 of that
measured with the potent stimulator tumor necrosis factor-a
(TNF-a; Fig. 3). Importantly, activation of NF-nB in terms of
DNA binding remained elevated until f36 h after PG stimulation
(Fig. 3), once again providing evidence that PG stimulation results
in sustained activation of NF-nB. In transient transfection assays,
using a promoter-reporter construct, a significant increase in the
expression of luciferase was once again measured in AR42J cells
stimulated by PG for 6 to 36 h (data not shown).
Phosphorylation (activation) of p65 NF-KB is downstream of
PI3K/Akt/MAPK/ERKs. In the next set of experiments, we
examined the role of individual kinases in mediating phosphorylation of the indicated kinases/transcription factor in response to
PG. Surprisingly, inhibition of either Akt (via Akt inhibitor) or PI3K
(via LY294002 compound) had no effect on the PG-stimulated
phosphorylation of p44/42 ERKs (Supplementary Fig. S3A), or the
phosphorylation of p38 MAPK (Supplementary Fig. S3B), suggesting that phosphorylation of MAPK/ERK in response to PG

Figure 5. A and B, p65 NF-nB siRNA reverses antiapoptotic effects of PG on AR42J cells. AR42J cells in culture were transiently transfected either with a control
negative (Neg ) siRNA or with a specific NF-nB p65 siRNA construct as described in Materials and Methods. The transfected cells were treated with or without
0.1 nmol/L PG for 48 to 72 h as indicated in (A ) and (B) followed by treatment with camptothecin (10 Amol/L) for 4 h before the end of the treatment. The cells
were processed for Western blot analysis with specific antibodies against either total p65 NF-nB (A ) or activated caspase-3 (B). The blots were reprobed with
anti-h-actin antibodies as an internal control. Treatment with the control (negative) siRNA or PG (0.1 nmol/L) or camptothecin (10 Amol/L) had no effect on the relative
levels of total NF-nB (A, lanes 1–4 ), but treatment with specific NF-nB p65 siRNA (A, lane 5) resulted in approximately 70% to 75% loss in the relative levels of
total NF-nB. Similarly, the antiapoptotic effects of PG in response to camptothecin (lanes 3 and 4 ) were not affected in cells transfected with the negative (control) siRNA
(B, lane 4) but were completely reversed in the presence of specific NF-nB p65 siRNA (B, lane 5). C, effect of kinase inhibitors on reversing the antiapoptotic effects of
PG in response to camptothecin. AR42J cells in culture were treated with the indicated kinase inhibitors followed by treatment with PG as described in Materials

for 2 h). The explanation for the abbreviations for the inhibitors and concentrations used are the same as described in the legend of Supplementary Fig. S2. At the
end of the treatment, the cells were processed for measuring the relative levels of cell death using a cell death assay kit as described in Materials and Methods.

stimulation may not be dependent on phosphorylation of PI3K/Akt
at the time point examined. On the other hand, inhibition of either
MAPK or ERKs resulted in a significant inhibition in relative levels
of phosphorylated PI3K (Supplementary Fig. S3C) and phosphorylated Akt (Supplementary Fig. S3D) to control levels, suggesting
that phosphorylation of PI3K/Akt molecules may be downstream
of phosphorylation of MAPK/ERK kinases in response to PG at
time points examined in this study.
The role of MAPK/ERKs and PI3K/Akt in the phosphorylation
and activation of NF-nB in response to PG was next examined as
described in the legend of Fig. 4. Inhibition of either MAPK or ERKs
resulted in an almost complete loss in the relative levels of
phosphorylated p65 NF-nB (Fig. 4A), whereas inhibition of either
PI3K or Akt was less effective (Fig. 4B versus Fig. 4A). In transient
transfection studies, using a promoter-reporter assay, a similar
pattern was obtained in response to the specific kinase inhibitors
(Fig. 4C). Inhibition of either MAPK or ERKs was more effective
than inhibition of either PI3K or Akt in reversing the activation of
NF-nB in response to PG (Fig. 4C).
NF-KB is required for mediating antiapoptotic effects of PG
on AR42J cells. We next examined if NF-nB was required for
mediating antiapoptotic effects of PG on AR42J cells. NF-nB siRNA
was used for down-regulating expression of NF-nB. As can be seen
in Fig. 5A, cells transfected with NF-nB siRNA showed a loss of
f75% of NF-nB protein (Fig. 5A, lane 5), whereas treatment of cells
with a negative control siRNA in the presence or absence of PG or
camptothecin had no effect on relative levels of NF-nB (Fig. 5A,
lanes 1–4). Loss of NF-nB as a result of treatment of cells with NFnB siRNA resulted in a complete loss of antiapoptotic effects of PG
(in terms of relative levels of activated caspase-3) in response to
proapoptotic agent camptothecin (Fig. 5B, lane 5). Results in Fig. 5
thus confirmed for the first time that NF-nB was required for

mediating protective (survival) effects of PG on pancreatic cancer
cells.
Relative role of MAPK/ERKs/PI3K/Akt and p65 NF-KB in
mediating antiapoptotic effects of PG on AR42J cells. In the
final set of experiments, rather than using surrogate markers of
apoptosis, we used the cell death assay kit for measuring the role
of various kinases in mediating antiapoptotic effects of PG as
described in the legend of Fig. 5C. Inhibiting the activation of NFnB (via NEMO peptide) was most effective in completely reversing
protective effects of PG on cell death of AR42J cells in response to
camptothecin (Fig. 5C, lane 4 versus lane 3). Inhibitors of MAPK
and ERKs were also quite effective (70–80%) in reversing
protective effects of PG (Fig. 5C, lanes 5 and 6 versus lane 3);
inhibitors of PI3K and Akt were somewhat less effective (55–65%;
Fig. 5C, lanes 7 and 8 versus lane 3). Inhibiting the activation of
caspase-3 (Fig. 5C, lane 9) significantly reduced proapoptotic
effects of camptothecin (Fig. 5C, lane 2). Various combinations of
kinase inhibitors as shown in Fig. 5C (lanes 10–16) were not any
more effective than inhibiting activation of NF-nB with NEMO
peptide alone (Fig. 5C, lane 4); these results suggest that
activation of NF-nB may represent the ultimate pathway for
mediating antiapoptotic effects of PG on pancreatic cancer cells.
Based on the results presented in Figs. 1–5, a hypothetical model
is presented in Fig. 6, describing the upstream versus downstream
effects of PG on activation of various kinases.

Discussion
In the current study, we show for the first time that NF-nB
plays a critical role in mediating antiapoptotic effects of PG on a
pancreatic cancer cell line. There are five members of the
mammalian NF-nB family, RelA (p65), RelB, c-Rel, p50/p105 (NFnB1), and p52/p100 (NF-nB2), which exist in unstimulated cells
as homodimers or heterodimers bound to InB family proteins
(27, 28). Binding of InB to NF-nB prevents NF-nB-InB complex
from translocating to the nucleus, thereby maintaining NF-nB in
an inactive state. In the classic (canonical) pathway of NF-nB
activation, on stimulation by a cytokine/growth factor, the
signaling pathways lead to activation of h subunit of IKK, which
phosphorylates InB proteins, leading to their polyubiquitination
and degradation (28). The freed NF-nB dimers translocate to the
nucleus, where they bind to specific sequences in the promoter or
enhancer regions of target genes. In AR42J cells, PG stimulated
phosphorylation of IKKa/h, resulting in phosphorylation and
degradation of InBa followed by phosphorylation, nuclear
translocation, and activation of NF-nB p65.
The IKK complex contains two kinase subunits (IKKa and IKKh)
and a regulatory subunit, NEMO (also called IKKg; ref. 31). In the
classic NF-nB signaling pathway, IKKh is both necessary and
sufficient for phosphorylating InBa and InBh. We confirmed a
critical role of IKKh and NEMO in experiments with NEMO peptide
(a selective inhibitor of IKKh). NEMO peptide attenuated PGstimulated phosphorylation of NF-nB p65 and abrogated the
antiapoptotic effects of PG on AR42J cells; this critical role of
NF-nB was further confirmed in experiments with specific siRNA
against NF-nB p65 transcripts. Results of our studies thus suggest
that NF-nB activation by the canonical pathway is primarily
involved in mediating growth effects of PG on AR42J cells.
Multiple signaling pathways lead to phosphorylation and
activation of IKK complexes. IKK kinases include members of
the MAPK kinase family, such as MAPK/ERK kinase kinase (MEKK)

1, 2, and 3 (27, 31). Other putative IKK kinases include members of
the atypical protein kinase C (PKC) family, Akt, and two proteins
related to IKKa/h, IKKI and NF-nB–activating kinase B (27). Our
studies show that NF-nB activation in response to PG is
downstream of MAPKs/ERKs and PI3K/Akt signaling pathways.
A potent inhibitor of histone deacetylase, trichostatin A was also
reported to activate NF-nB via PI3K and MAPK signaling pathways (32).
In many cells, Akt acts upstream of NF-nB (33). However, in a
few cases, NF-nB activation was reported to be independent of
Akt function (34). Whereas one group has reported that PI3K/Akt
does not contribute toward constitutive NF-nB activation in the
pancreatic cancer cells (19), another group reported that
constitutive NF-nB–mediated transcription in CRC cell lines was
dependent on activation of PI3K/Akt (35). These discrepancies
may be due to noncoordinate expression of IKKs, which was
postulated to play a role in determining the cell type–specific role
of PI3K/Akt in NF-nB activation (33). Cells with high proportion
of IKKa (activated by Akt) to IKKh are more sensitive to PI3K
inhibitors and vice versa (33). The results of our studies suggest
that inhibition of ERKs and/or p38 MAPK almost completely
attenuated activation of NF-nB in response to PG, whereas
inhibition of PI3K/Akt was less effective. Similarly, adiponectin, an
obesity-related factor, activated NF-nB via increased phosphorylation of ERKs and p38 MAPKs (36). However, a cell-specific role
of MAPKs versus PI3K/Akt has been shown. For example, acetyl11-keto-h-boswellic acid suppressed activation of IKK through
inhibition of Akt and p38 MAPK but not p44/p42 MAPK (37),
whereas both ERK1/2 and Akt pathways mediate inhibitory
effects of green tea polyphenol ( )-epigallocatechin-3-gallate on
NF-nB activation in colon cancer cells (38). These studies show
that signaling pathways leading toward activation of NF-nB are
cell and/or stimulus specific.
NF-nB can be additionally activated by IKK-independent pathways. For example, protein kinase A binds p65 and phosphorylates
p65 at Ser276 independent of InB degradation (31). Akt and PKC~
also phosphorylate p65 at distinct residues and increase transcriptional activation of NF-nB without involving InB degradation
(31). a2-Macroglobulin, bound to surface-associated GRP 78 on
prostrate cancer cells, was reported to activate NF-nB by both
canonical and noncanonical pathways (39). However, a role of
noncanonical pathways in response to PG in AR42 J cells seems
less likely because NEMO almost completely attenuated antiapoptotic effects of PG on AR42J cells.
In the current studies, we measured a delayed activation of NF-nB
in response to PG in AR42J cells. A small peak of activation was
measured at 30 min (Fig. 2B) followed by a more robust peak at 6 h,
which was sustained for f36 h. NF-nB regulates its own activity by
transcriptional activation of InBa, which represents a negative
feedback loop and drives oscillations in levels of activated NF-nB
(40). Etoposide (a topoisomerase inhibitor) induces lower amplitude
oscillations than TNF-a, with a delayed peak of NF-nB activation at
300 min (40). The pattern of peak timing and amplitude/oscillation
is not only stimulus specific but also cell specific (40). We measured
peak levels of phosphorylated InBa and phosphorylated NF-nB
p65Ser536 (translocated to the nucleus) at 6 h compared with a rapid
induction of peak levels in response to TNF-a (Fig. 2C). Activation

of NF-nB has similarly been reported to be delayed but sustained in
response to lipopolysaccharide (LPS; ref. 41). NF-nB activation
induced by cigarette smoke condensate is similarly persistent (42).
In the case of PG, we have measured activation of several signaling
kinases, including MAPK/ERKs/JNK and PI3K/Akt (current studies)
and h-catenin.3 It is thus possible that activation of multiple
signaling pathways may have resulted in the observed delayed and
sustained activation of NF-nB in response to PG in AR42J cells as
reported for LPS, etoposide, and cigarette smoke condensate.
Because IKK is one of the many kinases implicated in direct
phosphorylation of p65 at Ser536 (29), we examined Ser536
phosphorylation of p65 in response to PG. We have also measured
Ser276 phosphorylation of p65 in AR42J cells in response to PG,3
suggesting that NF-nB is likely phosphorylated at both Ser276 and
Ser536 in response to PG stimulation in AR42J cells. Whereas almost
all pancreatic cancers have high levels of constitutively active NFnB (14), because AR42J cells are relatively differentiated, levels of
activated NF-nB are very low in unstimulated AR42J cells (Fig. 3).
We therefore measured a significant increase in the proliferation of
AR42J cells in response to 0.1 to 1.0 nmol/L PG, which correlated
with potent antiapoptotic effects of PG (Fig. 1).
Several receptor subtypes mediate the growth factor effects of
gastrin/PG peptides on target cells (2, 26). However, we and
others have shown that the growth factor effects of PG are
mediated by novel receptor mechanisms that are distinct from
CCK2R (2, 43, 44). In the current study, we confirmed that PG had
a relatively poor binding affinity for CCK2R (Fig. 1C). On the other
hand, the binding of radiolabeled PG to AR42J cells was not
inhibited by either CCK or G17 (Fig. 1C). In cell lines that do not
express CCK2R (such as IEC 18 cells), G17 showed a significant
binding affinity for PG-binding sites (3), which led us to postulate
that RBA of G17 for PG-binding sites is dictated by the presence or
absence of CCK2R (45). The results of the binding studies (Fig. 1)
provide further evidence for our above hypothesis. Several years ago,
we had identified a 33 to 36 kDa protein as a high-affinity binding
protein for PG/gastrin peptides, which was pharmacologically
different from CCK1R and CCK2R (46). Recently, we discovered that
ANX-II represented the novel p36 receptor protein (11). Unlike
CCK2R antibodies, ANX-II antibodies completely attenuated growth
effects of PG on AR42J cells (Fig. 1D), confirming our previous
findings with IEC and colon cancer cells (11).
Besides PG, other gastrin-like peptides also activate NF-nB via
either CCK1R (47) or CCK2R (48). CCK2R antagonist and a PKC
inhibitor completely attenuated gastrin-induced activation of
NF-nB (48); surprisingly, inhibition of p38 MAPK had no effect on
NF-nB activation (48). However, our studies suggest that p38 MAPK
plays a critical role in mediating activation of NF-nB in response to
PG in AR42J cells. These findings once again show that, although
many ligands, ligand receptors, and kinases activate NF-nB, the
specific kinases that signal to NF-nB activation are stimulus and/or
cell specific. The findings thus far suggest that binding of PG/G17like peptides to their cognate receptors (such as ANX-II, CCK1R, and
CCK2R) can potentially result in activation of NF-nB via many
different pathways, resulting in differential effects on different
cell types.
Binding of various ligands with ANX-II has been reported to
result in the activation of several signaling pathways, including NFnB, JAK/STAT, p38 MAPK, and MEKK4, as recently reviewed (49).
It is possible that PG binding to ANX-II may provide a similar
platform for multimeric complex formation of various kinases
resulting in the observed activation of several signaling molecules
