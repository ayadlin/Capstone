ABSTRACT
Goat peroxiredoxin-5 (gPRDX5) was verified as a good anti-cancer bioactive
peptide (ACBP) against different tumor cell lines. Considering the immunogenicity
between species for further therapeutic application, it is necessary to similarly
investigate the antitumor activity of human peroxiredoxin-5 (hPRDX5) with 89%
similarity in sequence to gPRDX5. In order to evaluate its antitumor activity, the
potential anti-neoplastic effect of hPRDX5 on a mouse model was observed directly.
The results of its in vivo antitumor activity suggested that hPRDX5 could resist
immunosuppression by promoting lymphocyte proliferation and up-regulating the
levels of serum cytokines. Meanwhile, PD-L1 was speculated as one of the targets of
hPRDX5 to inhibit tumor by enhancing the immune activity according to a preliminary
molecular docking study on the interactions between hPRDX5 and PD-L1. The modeling
provides a basis for structural modification on hPRDX5/PD-L1 for further biological and
biochemical study on the pathway blocking mechanism of hPRDX5. In this work, the
results demonstrate that hPRDX5 displays efficient antitumor and immunoregulatory
properties in the colon cancer C26/BALB/c and melanoma B16/C57Bl/6 mice tumor
models, and suggest the potential of developing peptides from hPRDX5 as low
molecular weight drug candidates for corresponding cancer immunotherapy.

INTRODUCTION

the peptide was complicated and time-consuming, and the
yield was low as well. Therefore, we identified the aminoacid sequence of the peptide by employing 2D-nano-LCESI-LTQ-Orbitrap MS/MS in combination with Mascot
database search in the goat subset of the Uniprot database
and purified the corresponding protein by heterogeneous
expression [9]. Thereafter, the anti-cancer bioactivity of
gPRDX5 was confirmed with several kinds of tumor-cells
and indicated that it was a good anti-cancer candidate,
especially against B16 cells.
Considering the immunogenicity between species
for further therapeutic applications, the human homologue
protein of gPRDX5 was designed for further investigation
on its antitumor activity, based on the speculation that
homologous proteins in sequence have similar structures

The goat peroxiredoxin-5 (gPRDX5) is an anti-cancer
bioactive peptide (ACBP), which was first identified
by Xiulan Su [1] from goat spleen or liver which was
immunized with human gastric cancer protein extract.
In long-term animal experiments, this ACBP exhibited
potential antitumor activities without measurable side
effects [1–4]. And, its anti-cancer effect was mainly
exerted by affecting cell cycle and inducing cell
apoptosis [5]. In combination with Cisplatin, gPRDX5
also reduced chemotherapy dosage and decreased
toxicity, thus improving the life quality of xenograft nude
mice bearing human gastric cancer [5–8]. However, the
procedure of immunization and purification to acquire

and thus similar functions. Therefore, the sequence of
gPRDX5 was analyzed by BLAST on the website http://
blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi to search its human
homologue, and the result showed that the human
peroxiredoxin-5 (hPRDX5) was 89% similar to gPRDX5.
The peroxiredoxins (PRDXs) are a ubiquitous
family of antioxidant enzymes which catalyze the
reduction of hydrogen peroxide, alkyl hydroperoxides
and peroxynitrite [10]. Mammalian cells express six
isoforms of PRDXs (PRDX1 to PRDX6), and all these
six isotypes have been discovered in distinct subcellular
locations and show a wide tissue distribution [11].
Peroxiredoxin 5 (PRDX5), the last isoform identified in
the peroxiredoxin family, possesses unique properties [12].
First, PRDX5 is the only mammalian member of the
atypical 2-Cysteine (2-Cys) PRDX subfamily [13].
Second, PRDX5 exhibits a remarkably wide subcellular
localization such as mitochondria, cytosol, peroxisomes,
and nucleus [14]. And third, PRDX5 plays many vital
roles under physiopathological conditions. For instance,
overexpression of PRDX5 in human tendon cells induces
apoptosis following H2O2 treatment [15], up-regulation of
PRDX5 has been reported in osteoarthritic cartilage and
in TNF-α or IL-1β treated cartilage explants from patients
with osteoarthritis [16], and PRDX5 was proven to be
an anti-fibrotic effector that sustains renal physiology by
inhibiting stat3 activation in rat kidney interstitial fibroblast
cells [17]. However, the antitumor effect of PRDX5 has
not yet been reported substantially. In view of this, we
investigate the antitumor potential of hPRDX5, triggered
by the antitumor activities of gPRDX5, herein in details.
An intact immune system is capable of recognizing
and eliminating tumor cells through immune checkpoints.
However, tumors can adapt to and circumvent these
natural defense mechanisms [18–20]. The interaction
between the programmed death 1 (PD-1) receptor and its
ligand 1 (PD-L1) is a key pathway hijacked by tumors
to suppress immune control [21–24]. Programmed cell
death-1 (PD-1), an immunoinhibitory receptor of the
CD28 family, which plays a major role in tumor immune
escape [25, 26], is an inhibitory receptor expressed on
the surface of T cells that physiologically limits T-cell
activation and proliferation [27]. PD-L1 is one of two
PD-1 ligands and is expressed on both antigen-presenting
cells and T cells. Binding of PD-L1 to the PD-1 receptor
regulates T cells negatively, causing decreased production
of the effector cytokines, such as IL-2 and IFN-γ [28–30].
Therefore, blocking these interactions showed outstanding
promise in restoring T cells’ activity and reactivating the
immune system to recognize and eradicate tumor and
infected cells [31–33].
In our investigation, by taking advantage of
molecular docking, the PD-L1 was selected as the
potential target of hPRDX5 in the preliminary modeling
for two reasons. First, PD-L1 is highly up-regulated in
many types of tumor cells, such as melanoma, ovarian
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

and lung cancers [34]. Second, the preliminary mechanism
study revealed that hPRDX5 could increase the content
of IL-2 significantly, which may function by inhibiting
PD-L1. The potential mechanism by which the binding of
hPRDX5 to PD-L1 exerts antitumor activity, by blocking
the pathway of PD-1/PD-L1, was discussed based on a
predicted structural modeling of hPRDX5-PD-L1 complex
for further biological investigations.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Antitumor activity in C26-injected mice
Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most common
cancer worldwide and the fifth leading cause of death
related to cancer in China [35]. Therefore, we monitored
the tumor growth in a mouse model of colon cancer. We
found significant decreases in the tumor growth in mice
treated with hPRDX5 in a dose-dependent manner. The
inhibition rate of 150 mg/kg hPRDX5 was 32.16%, which
demonstrated that hPRDX5 inhibited tumor growth in
C26-injected mice (Figure 2). In order to preliminarily
explore the action mechanism of hPRDX5, the effects of
hPRDX5 on spleen and thymus indices of C26-injected
mice were evaluated. Both of them were increased
significantly compared with control group when the mice
were treated with hPRDX5 in a dose-dependent manner
(Figure 3), indicating that hPRDX5 was able to counteract
the effect of immunosuppression on immune organs
development and protect the immune organs against the
impairment caused by tumor. Hence, we hypothesize that
it possesses the capacity of suppressing tumor through
regulating organism immune function.

Antitumor activity in melanoma B16-bearing mice
To get insight into its activity in tumor immunity
and function mechanism, we observed the tumor growth
in melanoma B16-bearing mice, which is commonly
used to investigate tumor immunity. We found significant
decreases in the tumor growth in mice treated with 75.0
mg/kg hPRDX5, which is the optimal dose in preliminary
experiments, compared with those observed in mice
treated with IL-2 (25.0 ng/kg), IFN-γ (5.0 μg/kg) or
PBS. The results demonstrated that the inhibition rate
of hPRDX5 was above 39% (Table 1), which suggested
that hPRDX5 was likely to possess broad-spectrum
anti-tumor activity in vivo. To identify the potential
underlying mechanism of tumor suppression of hPRDX5,
its effects on the proliferation of mitogen-induced splenic
lymphocytes and the levels of cytokines were evaluated
subsequently.
Lymphocytes are the key effector cells of
mammalian adaptive immune system. Lymphocyte
proliferation is the direct indicator reflecting the state
of immunity in animal. Cell-mediated immunity can

exert the actions of anti-infection, antitumor, helping
lymphocyte produce antibody by sensitized lymphocyte
against corresponding antigen [36]. In contrast,
humoral immunity refers to antibody production and
the accessory processes that accompany it, including:
Th2 activation, germinal center formation and
isotype switching, affinity maturation and memory
cell generation. As generally known, concanavalin A
stimulates lymphocyte T cells, which are involved in
cell-mediated immunity, and LPS stimulates B cell
proliferation are responsible for humoral immune
response. Therefore, we investigated the effect of
hPRDX5 on lymphocyte proliferation with mitogen
stimulation. As illustrated in Figure 3, the proliferative
responses of splenic lymphocytes to concanavalin A
and LPS were enhanced significantly compared with
the control group. The proliferation of lymphocytes
were enhanced by hPRDX5 with the stimulation
index of 1.75, 2.53, 2.51 and 2.96 in the presence of
LPS at 1, 5, 10, 20 μg/ml, respectively (Figure 4A).
Likewise, in the presence of concanavalin A at 5, 10,
20 μg/ml hPRDX5 elicited an increase in lymphocytes
proliferation by 1.67, 1.91 and 1.87, respectively
(Figure 4B). These results suggested that hPRDX5
improved both cellular and humoral immunity in
melanoma B16-bearing mice by enhancing both T cell
and B cell proliferation.
Cytokines play an important role in cell-cell
communication in the immune system. Thereupon,

we determined the effects of hPRDX5 on the
levels of cytokines. The levels of interleukin-2
(IL-2), interleukin-4 (IL-4), interleukin-6 (IL6), interleukin-10 (IL-10), tumor necrosis factor-α
(TNF-α) and tumor necrosis factor-β (TNF-β) increased
significantly except interferon-γ (IFN-γ) reduced
slightly (Figure 5), which indicated that hPRDX5
could promote the secretion of IL-2, IL-4, IL-6,
IL-10, TNF-α and TNF-β. Therefore, we speculate that
hPRDX5 has regulatory effects on inflammation and
lymphocyte functions through these cytokines secretion
to possess its anti-cancer activities.

Interaction between hPRDX5 and PD-L1
through molecular modeling
Based on the previously proposed sites of PD-L1
residues important for the inhibitor binding [37, 38], we
carried out a modeling study to investigate the potential
interaction between hPRDX5 and PD-L1. In the predicted
model, almost all the key interactions between hPRDX5
and the binding site of PD-L1 are conducted by the four
conservative residues (Glu16, Asn21, Glu27 and Lys30)
in hPRDX5 (Figure 6): For example, there are three
hydrogen bonds between Lys30 of hPRDX5 and Tyr123
of PD-L1, Asn21 of hPRDX5 and Pro24 of PD-L1,
and Arg95 of hPRDX5 and Asp122 of PD-L1. The
conservative nature of these residues in hPRDX5 and
other PRDX enzymes suggests that their important roles

increased significantly compared with control group when the mice were given intraperitoneal injection of hPRDX5 at 12.5, 25.0, 50.0,
75.0 or 150.0 mg/kg, respectively (P < 0.05 compared to control group).

MATERIALS AND METHODS

in forming the binding interface with PD-L1. Based on
the current modeling results, the in vivo investigation on
the potential interaction between hPRDX5 and PD-L1
is being carried on, which will be published in the near
future. Furthermore, the identified residues of hPRDX5
are important to help in designing small peptides which
can act as protein-protein interaction inhibitors with lower
manufacturing costs and higher stability (Figure 7) for
clinical therapeutic applications. This model provides
the tool to fully use this unique immunotherapeutic
pathway and rationally develop more effective and safer
peptide inhibitors to block the protein-protein interactions
involved in this pathway.

Experiments were performed using the model of
melanoma B16 developed in C57Bl/6 male mice aged
6–8 weeks. The model of primary tumor growth (hereafter
“subcutaneous melanoma”) was induced by subcutaneous
inoculation of B16 cells (2 × 105 cells per mouse, obtained
from the Institute of Basic Medical Sciences, Chinese
Academy of Medical Sciences) into the withers of each
mouse. After tumor transplantation, the animals were
assigned to experimental and control groups (8 mice per
group) and were then kept in their compartments until
the end of the experiment. The hPRDX5 of 75.0 mg/kg
in sterile PBS (100 μl) was subcutaneously injected into
the mice once a day for 20 days starting on day 5 prior
to the inoculation of tumor. Control mice received the
same volume of IL-2 (25.0 ng/kg) [41], IFN-γ (5.0 μg/kg)
[42] once three days after tumor transplantation (positive
control) or PBS (solvent control) as described in hPRDX5.
On 15th day after the tumor transplantation the
mice were euthanized, tumor weight was measured, and
the peripheral blood, thymuses and spleens were isolated
for further analysis. The inhibition rate of tumor was
calculated by the following equation: Inhibition rate (%)
= (1-Tumor weighttest/Tumor weightsolvent control)×100%.

strain as 6×His-tagged fusion protein using pET28a(+)
expression vector and purified as described previously
(gPRDX5) [9]. Eventually, a pure protein of about 17 kDa
was acquired by heterogenesis expression (Figure 1).

Lymphocyte proliferation test

Animal models and treatment

Cell proliferation was assessed as described by
Swamy SM et al [43]. Splenocytes were obtained by
gently placing the organ in RPMI-1640 medium (Sigma,
USA) under aseptic conditions, followed by filtration and
centrifugation (1000 rpm for 5 min) at room temperature.
The erythrocytes were removed by hemolytic Gey’s
solution, while the remaining cells were centrifuged at
1000 rpm for 5 min. After two washes, the splenocytes
were re-suspended in RMPI-1640 medium containing 10%
fetal bovine serum (FBS), and adjusted to 1 × 107 cell/ml.
100 μl of splenocyte suspension (1 × 107 cell/ml) in a 96well culture plate was cultured in RPMI-1640 medium
containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) with the addition
of mitogens (LPS at 5, 10, 20 μg/ml or concanavalin A at 1,
5, 10, 20 μg/ml) (Sigma, USA). After incubation for 72 h
at 37°C in a humidified 5% CO2 incubator, the number
of proliferating cells was determined after centrifugation
(1500 rpm for 10 min) by MTT assay [44] at a wavelength
of 570 nm. The stimulation index was calculated by the
following equation: Stimulation index = ODtest/ODcontrol.

All animal experiments were conducted in
accordance with The Standards for Laboratory Animals
(GB14925-2001) and The Guideline on the Humane
Treatment of Laboratory Animals (MOST 2006a)
established by the People’s Republic of China. And our
protocols confirmed to the guidelines of Chinese Academy
of Medical Sciences for experimental animal care and use.

The model of C26-injected mice
Cachexia was induced by subcutaneous grafting of a
0.5 mm3 fragment of colon carcinoma (C26, obtained from
the Institute of Basic Medical Sciences, Chinese Academy
of Medical Sciences) in the dorsal region of 6- to 8-weekold BALB/c female mice. Mice were housed in standard
conditions with day/night cycles of 12 hours and assigned
to experimental and control groups (8 mice per group).
Different concentrations of hPRDX5 (12.5, 25.0, 50.0, 75.0,
150.0 mg/kg) in sterile PBS (100 μl) were subcutaneously
injected into the mice once a day for 20 days starting
on day 5 prior to the inoculation of tumor. Control mice
received the same volume of topotecan hydrochloride
(TPT) (3.0 mg/kg), is of a wide range of applications in
chemotherapy against various malignancies [39, 40], once
three days after tumor transplantation (positive control) or
PBS (solvent control) as described in hPRDX5.

CONCLUSIONS

REFERENCES

In summary, the amino-acid sequence of gPRDX5,
which is one of anti-cancer bioactive peptides (ACBPs),
was identified in our lab. Meanwhile, we confirmed the
anti-cancer bioactivity of gPRDX5 in vitro [9]. In this
study, to overcome the immunogenicity between species
for further therapeutic application, we got the sequence
information of hPRDX5 by BLAST according to
gPRDX5’s sequence, and expressed the hPRDX5 protein
with synthetic DNA sequence. Whereafter, the anti-cancer
bioactivity of hPRDX5 was evaluated in colon cancer
C26/BALB/c and melanoma B16/C57Bl/6 mice tumor
models, and the results suggest that hPRDX5 could
resist immunosuppression by promoting immune organs
development, lymphocyte proliferation and up-regulation
of the levels of serum cytokines. Moreover, the molecular
docking study on hPRDX5/PD-L1 allows for a theoretical
interpretation of PD-L1 immune blockade pathway by
hPRDX5. In a word, our results provide a promising basis
for getting more insights into PD-1/PD-L1’s immune
regulation and future development of the corresponding
immunomodulating peptides related to hPRDX5 as drug
candidates against corrcancers.
