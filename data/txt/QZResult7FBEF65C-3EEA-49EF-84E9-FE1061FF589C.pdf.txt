ABSTRACT
Down-regulation of the gap junction protein connexin26 (Cx26) is an early
event following breast cancer onset and has led to Cx26 being classically described
as a tumor suppressor. Interestingly, mutations in the Cx26 gene (GJB2) reduce
or ablate Cx26 gap junction channel function and are the most common cause of
genetic deafness. It is unknown if patients with loss-of-function GJB2 mutations
have a greater susceptibility to breast tumorigenesis or aggressive breast cancer
progression. To investigate these possibilities, 7, 12-dimethylbenz[α]anthracene
(DMBA)-induced tumor development was evaluated in BLG-Cre; Cx26fl/fl mice
expressing Cre under the β-Lactoglobulin promoter (Cre+) compared to Cx26fl/fl
control mice (Cre-) following pituitary isograft driven Cx26 knockout. A significantly
increased number of DMBA-treated Cre+ mice developed primary mammary tumors,
as well as developed multiple tumors, compared to Cre- mice. Primary tumors of
Cre+ mice were of multiple histological subtypes and had similar palpable tumour
onset and growth rate compared to tumors from Cre- mice. Lungs were evaluated for
evidence of metastases revealing a similar percentage of lung metastases in Cre+ and
Cre- mice. Together, our results suggest that loss of Cx26 predisposes the mammary
gland to chemically induced mammary tumour formation which may have important
implications to patients with GJB2 mutations.

INTRODUCTION

to the complexity of the disease and the identification of
these proteins is critical for the development of targeted
therapies and biomarkers [6]. Gap junction proteins
remain interesting candidates as down-regulation of gap
junctions remains one of the earliest events in tumour
progression [7].
Gap junctions are clusters of intercellular channels
formed by connexin subunits between adjacent cells
allowing for metabolic and ionic signaling in a process
known as gap junctional intercellular communication
(GJIC) [8]. GJIC has been linked to critical cellular
functions; such as proliferation, differentiation and
apoptosis, which are frequently dysregulated in cancer

Breast cancer is the most frequently diagnosed
cancer affecting women in the world [1]. Early detection
remains a key factor in patient survivability as the 5
year survival rate for stage 1 breast cancer is over 90%
compared to < 30% for stage 4 breast cancer [2-4].
Therefore, the identification of at risk populations may
be important for early detection of the disease in order
to improve patient survivability [5]. In addition, although
much progress is being made to understand signaling
pathways in breast cancer, key regulators of breast cancer
progression and metastasis remain poorly understood due

RESULTS

[9]. In addition to GJIC, gap junction channel independent
functions involving the connexin interactome and
hemichannel function have been shown to be linked to cell
growth [10-14]. The connexin family in humans consists
of 21 genes but only Cx26 and Cx43 are unequivocally
expressed in the human breast [15]. Similarly, the rodent
mammary gland also expresses Cx43 and Cx26 but also
expresses Cx30 and Cx32 that are dynamically regulated
throughout mammary gland development [15]. Only
Cx26 and Cx43 have classically been described as tumour
suppressors in the breast based on loss of expression in
many mammary tumor cell lines and the fact that ectopic
re-expression of these connexins reverts some tumor cells
into a more differentiated phenotype both in vitro and in
vivo [11 12, 16, 17]. However, adding to the complexity
of the role of connexins in breast cancer, both Cx43 and
Cx26 have also been reported to be upregulated in human
tumour biopsies at later stages of tumour progression
and may even act as tumour facilitators [18-20]. These
perplexing reports highlight the need for additional
studies, particularly in vivo, to clarify the role of connexins
throughout the progression of breast cancer from
tumour onset to metastasis. In this pursuit, we recently
demonstrated that Cx43 had a critical role in suppressing
metastasis to the lungs in a genetically-modified mouse
model where Cx43 function was greatly reduced [21].
However, the role of Cx26 in the mammary gland has not
been assessed in mice and this may be more important than
examining Cx43 as mammary neoplasms typically express
markers of luminal epithelial cells [22]. In addition, lossof-function mutations in the GJB2 gene that encodes
Cx26 are common in society and responsible for over
40% of hereditary deafness and many skin diseases [23].
Importantly, the worldwide prevalence of biallelic GJB2
related hearing loss accounts for 17.3 % of cases [23,
24]. The 35delG mutation is by far the most common and
results in the premature truncation of Cx26 and complete
systemic loss of channel function, thereby acting like a
knockout in the context of gap junction channel activity
[23]. Thus, whether this patient cohort is more or less
susceptible to breast tumor onset and progression could
have profound clinical implications [23]. Therefore, using
our previously described genetically-modified mice with
conditional knockout of Cx26 expression in the mammary
gland, we developed a DMBA-induced mouse model
of breast cancer [25]. We hypothesized that low levels
of Cx26 within the mammary gland would predispose
the mammary gland to the onset of tumors and increase
tumour progression and incidence of metastases.

Cx26 knockout does not result in spontaneous
mammary tumors
To evaluate whether conditional Cx26 knockout
mice spontaneously developed primary tumors in the
mammary gland, five Cx26 knockout and wild-type mice
were monitored for 1.5 years before being sacrificed and
evaluated for evidence of tumour formation. All mice
had at least 2 pregnancies which acted to drive Cx26
knockout as we have previously described [25]. Whole
mount and histological evaluation showed no evidence of
primary tumors suggesting that a reduction in Cx26 alone
is not sufficient to predispose mammary glands to tumour
formation (Figure 1).

DMBA-treated Cx26 knockout mice have greater
primary tumour burden compared to control
mice but develop mammary tumors with similar
growth characteristics
As our Cx26 knockout mice do not develop
spontaneous mammary tumors, we used a chemicallyinduced strategy where the carcinogen DMBA was used
in combination with pituitary isografts to induce Cx26
knockout. Following pituitary transplant, Cre- and Cre+
mice were treated with DMBA/oil either after (Group
1) or before (Group 2) Cx26 knockout, and mice were
evaluated for palpable tumour onset and number of
tumors. No oil treated mice from either group developed
mammary gland tumors (Figure 2A, 2D). Interestingly,
when comparing Cre- and Cre+ mice in which 3 months
had passed before Cx26 knockout, DMBA-treated Cre+
mice had a significantly (p < 0.0001, logrank test) lower
number of mice that remained tumour free compared to
Cre- mice over the duration of the experiment (Figure
2A). This corresponded to 89% of Cre+ mice developing
tumors (8/9 Cre+) compared to only 33% of control mice
(4/12 Cre-). Importantly, Cre+ mice had a significantly
(p < 0.001, Student’s unpaired t-test) greater average
number of mammary tumors per mouse at the end of the
experiment compared to Cre- mice; in which half (4/8)
of Cre+ mice that developed tumors presented with
multiple tumors while Cre- mice only ever developed
one tumour over the course of the experiment (Figure
2B, 2C). Alternatively, when DMBA-treatment occurred
1 week following pituitary transplant (and thus no Cx26
knockout) no difference was observed in the number of
mice that remained tumour free in which all mice of both
groups developed palpable mammary tumors (Figure 2D).
In addition, no difference was observed in the average
number of mammary tumors per mouse between Cre+

and Cre- mice at the end of the experiment in which
43% (3/7) of both DMBA-treated Cre+ and Cre- mice
developed multiple mammary tumors suggesting similar
tumor multiplicity (Figure 2E, 2F). Therefore, our results
suggest that loss of Cx26 within the mammary gland prior
to DMBA-treatment predisposed the mammary gland for
increased tumour burden compared to control mice.
We next assessed whether the day of palpable
tumour onset was earlier in Cx26 knockout mice following
the end of DMBA treatment. Mammary tumors from Cre+
mice treated with DMBA following Cx26 knockout had
similar palpable tumour onset (75±14 days) compared
to Cre- mice (60±10 days) suggesting that despite an
increased frequency of developing mammary tumors,
tumors arose at comparable times in Cre+ and Cre- mice
(Figure 3A). Similarly, palpable tumor onset in mice
treated with DMBA 1 week following pituitary transplant
was non-significantly different in Cre+ (98±23 days)
compared to Cre- mice (71±18 days) (Figure 3C). Taken
together, knockout of Cx26 does not appear to increase

the day of onset of chemically-induced mammary tumors.
Once the largest mammary tumors reached ~1cm3 or
~1 year after DMBA treatment, mice were sacrificed and
tissue was collected. Tumour volume of the largest tumour
divided by the number of days since palpable tumour
onset was used to calculate the average tumour growth
rate. Comparing mice treated with DMBA 3 months after
pituitary isografts, the average tumour growth rate were
non-significantly different between Cre- (49±30 mm3/
day) and Cre+ (81±39 mm3/day) mice suggesting that
Cx26 knockout prior to mammary tumour onset did not
predispose the gland to primary tumors with increased
growth rate (Figure 3B). Similarly, both Cre- (96±16
mm3/day) and Cre+ mice (76±17 mm3/day) treated with
DMBA 1 week after pituitary isografts developed tumors
with non-significantly different average tumour growth
rates (Figure 3D). Therefore, knockout of Cx26 does not
appear to predispose the mammary gland to tumors with
increased growth rate when Cx26 knockout occurs either
before or after DMBA treatment.

treatment did not predispose the mammary gland to
mammary tumors of a single histological subtype.
In order to further assess primary mammary
tumors from mice in which Cx26 knockout occurred
prior to DMBA treatment, mammary tumors were
immunolabelled with a variety of connexin, luminal and
myoepithelial markers (Figure 5A) and the percentage
of cells expressing the markers were recorded (Figure
5B). Immunofluorescent analysis of Cx26 revealed little
to no evidence of Cx26 labelling in tumors from Cre+
mice unlike the lactating mammary gland which acted as
a positive control (Figure 5Ai,5Aiii, 5B). Interestingly,
little to no evidence of Cx26 labelling was also observed
in tumors from Cre- mice suggesting that Cx26 was also
down-regulated in mammary tumors that did not express
the Cre transgene (Figure 5Aii, 5B). In addition, mammary
tumors immunolabelled for the expression of Cx43
revealed no overt difference in the level of Cx43 in the
mammary tumors of both Cre+ and Cre- mice although the
expression appeared diffuse and intracellular compared to
the more punctate pattern seen in the lactating mammary
gland (Figure 5Aiv, 5Av, 5B). Cx43 was also expressed
in carcinoma cells that did not always co-localize with
the myoepithelial marker keratin14 (Figure 5Avi, 5B).
To assess for the expression of luminal and myoepithelial
markers, when tumors were immunolabelled for the
luminal markers keratin 8, E-cadherin and β-catenin
and the myoepithelial markers keratin14 and α-smooth
muscle actin, no distinguishable differences were observed
between Cre- and Cre+ mice (Figure 5Avii, 5Aviii, 5Ax,
5Axi, 5Axii, 5B). Finally, only adenosquamous carcinoma
tumors from both Cre- and Cre+ mice labelled positively
for the skin marker keratin 10 typical of the epidermoid
differentiation of these tumors (Figure 5Aix). Taken
together, mammary tumors from mice in which Cx26 was
knocked down prior to DMBA treatment express similar
luminal and myoepithelial markers to mammary tumors
from control mice.

had greater evidence of cancer cell infiltration, lung tissue
was immunolabelled with Ki67, a marker of proliferating
cells, and separated into high ( > 50%) and low ( < 50%)
groups revealing a similar number of mice with high levels
of Ki67 staining in Cre- (50%) and Cre+ mice (38%)
(Figure 6D, 6E). Lung tumors immunolabelled for Cx26
and Cx43 to evaluate if connexin expression changes
between primary and metastatic tumors revealed mostly
the absent expression of both Cx26 and Cx43 in Cre(Cx26: 0/2, Cx43: 0/2) and Cre+ (Cx26: 0/5, Cx43: 1/5)
mice suggesting that connexins are not upregulated during
metastatic progression (Figure 6D, 6E).

DISCUSSION
Our study’s aims were two-fold; first, to evaluate
whether the organ-specific loss of Cx26 predisposed the
mammary gland to developing mammary tumors in vivo.
Secondly, to evaluate if loss of Cx26 in primary mammary
tumors led to altered progression and aggressiveness of
the disease. In order to evaluate these aims, we developed
the first chemically-induced conditionally ablated mouse
model of breast cancer to assess the role of Cx26. We
demonstrated that knockout of Cx26 prior to tumour
induction by DMBA treatment increased the susceptibility
of mice to primary mammary tumors but that this increase
in the frequency of breast tumour onset was not associated
with increased progression of the disease.

A model to investigate the role of Cx26 in
mammary tumorigenesis in vivo
Evaluating the in vivo role of Cx26 in breast
cancer is complicated by the fact that Cx26-/- mice die
embryonically due to defects in placenta rendering
them unusable for this kind of study [26]. As a result,
we used our previously characterized mammary gland
specific knockout mouse model of Cx26, in which ~70%
knockout of Cx26 was observed in the mammary gland
driven by Cre-mediated deletion under the BLG promoter
following the onset of lactation [25]. We observed no
evidence of spontaneous mammary tumors or abnormal
histology in 1.5 year old dams that have undergone at least
2 pregnancies which is in agreement with results from
mammary gland specific deletion of Cx26 using similar
Cre-loxP strategies under the mouse mammary tumour
virus and whey acidic protein promoters [27]. Therefore, it
appears that the loss of Cx26 is not sufficient for initiating
tumour onset which requires additional genetic insults.
In order to promote additional genetic mutations in
Cx26 knockout mice, we used the chemical carcinogen
DMBA that preferentially promotes the induction of
mammary tumors and paired this with the use of pituitary
isografts to drive BLG promoter activity [28]. The
combination of pituitary isografts and DMBA have been

Cx26 knockout and control mice exhibit similar
levels of metastasis to the lungs
Following our evaluation of the primary tumors, we
assessed the lung, a common site of metastasis in DMBAinduced mammary tumors, for signs of disseminated
disease [21]. Hematoxylin and eosin stained sections of
lung tissue revealed evidence of metastasis to the lungs
(Figure 6A) in which a similar proportion of mice from
Cre+ (50%) and Cre- mice (63%) developed tumors in the
lung (Figure 6B). Although only 2 DMBA-treated Cremice developed lung tumors, the average lung tumour
area per mouse was calculated revealing a likelihood of
larger average lung tumour area in Cre- mice (0.09 mm2)
compared to Cre+ mice (0.02 ± 0.009 mm2) (Figure 6C).

frequently used to drive mammary tumour development
through hormonal and chemical carcinogenesis [29,
30]. This approach was used by Wang et al. where
pituitary driven activation of the BLG promoter was
used to evaluate deregulated Pak1 activity in murine
mammary tumorigenesis [31]. Importantly, we observed
a clear reduction in the levels of Cx26 when paired nontumorigenic mammary glands from all Cre+ mice were
compared to Cre- mice at the time of sacrifice indicating
that the pituitary isografts were effectively driving the
knockout of Cx26, and more notably, that Cx26 knockout

persisted throughout the length of the experiment.
Therefore, using this strategy we evaluated whether the
loss of Cx26 prior to these additional genetic alterations
would promote tumour incidence.

Loss of Cx26 promotes tumour onset in
chemically-induced mammary tumorigenesis
Most studies to date suggest a tumour suppressive
role for Cx26 early in breast cancer progression based

on evidence that Cx26 is frequently absent or downregulated in human breast cancer cell lines or human
primary tumors [17, 19, 32]. In agreement, we observed
an increase in primary tumour incidence and tumour
multiplicity when Cx26 was knocked down prior to
DMBA treatments suggesting that expression of Cx26
acts in the context of a tumour suppressor and protects
the mammary gland to primary mammary tumour onset.
Somewhat unexpectedly, when DMBA-treatment occurred
only one week after the pituitary transplant, a similar
tumor burden was observed in Cx26 knockout and control
mice. While the pituitary isograft is necessary for Cx26
knockout, it serves a dual purpose as continual hormonal
secretion of prolactin, which importantly acts on the
ovary to induce synthesis and secretion of progesterone
and estrogen, which together promote a greater frequency
of chemical carcinogen induced mammary tumors
[33]. As a result, the potential tumour suppressive
effect of Cx26 may be masked by the pro-tumorigenic
effects of hormones secreted from the surgically placed
pituitary. Three lines of evidence support this; first, all
mice treated with DMBA one week following pituitary
transplant developed mammary tumors suggesting
hormones secreted or stimulated by pituitary isografts
were promoting tumor onset. Secondly, we observed
an increase in the frequency of tumor incidence in Cremice when the pituitary isografts occurred only one week
before DMBA treatment compared to Cre- mice in which
the same procedure occurred 12 weeks prior to DMBA
treatment. The pituitary driven increase in chemicallyinduced mammary tumors is the result of increasing the
proliferation of epithelial cells of the mammary gland
although this appears to be time dependent as the increase
in the mitotic index begins to fall after 5 weeks as the
levels of estrogen and progesterone drop [34]. Ultimately,
differences in the frequency of mammary tumors between
mice treated with DMBA one week or 12 weeks after
pituitary transplant may be explained by increased ovarian
hormonal stimulation by pituitaries transplanted closer to
the time of DMBA treatment limiting our assessment of
Cx26 in mice treated with DMBA one week following
pituitary isograft. Finally, a precedent exists that hormonal
influence may override any tumour suppressive effects of
Cx26 expression as stably transfected Cx26 expressing
MCF7 cells, with strong growth suppressing effects in
vitro, lacked growth suppressing effects in vivo potentially
as a result of the pro-tumorigenic effects of 17β estradiol
pellets [35]. Taken together, it appears likely that the
tumour suppressive effect of Cx26 may be masked by protumorigenic hormones secreted by the pituitary isograft.
The use of conditionally ablated mice did not help
us distinguish whether Cx26 functions through a GJICdependent or independent mechanism. However, as Cx26
possesses a very short C-terminal tail, it is more likely
that the increase in mammary gland tumor incidence in
conditional Cx26 knockout mice are the result of gap
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

junction channel or hemichannel related mechanism
and not related to the small Cx26 interactome [36-38].
Interestingly, Cx26-linked growth suppression in Hela
cells was associated with redistribution of cAMP and
activation of protein kinase A that was GJIC-dependent
as expression of the R75Y Cx26 mutant, that disrupts
gap junction channels but leaves hemichannel function
unchanged, did not suppress HeLa cell growth [39].
While the role of Cx26 hemichannels in the context of
the mammary gland is unclear, genetically-modified mice
with mammary gland specific expression of the G45E or
S17F Cx26 mutants, which differ in their respective gap
junction channel and hemichannel function, may provide
more clarity on the role of Cx26 hemichannels in breast
cancer [40, 41]. Taken together, our data revealed that
Cx26 protects the mammary gland from DMBA-induced
mammary tumour onset but this protective effect may be
masked in hormonally driven tumorigenesis.

Cx26 knockout prior to DMBA treatment does
not affect primary tumor growth or histological
subtype
Cx26 may regulate primary tumour cell growth
and proliferation, anchorage-independent and contactdependent growth in vitro, as well as reduced tumour
sizes in vivo when orthotopically injected into nude mice
through GJIC- dependent and -independent mechanisms
[10-12, 17, 35, 42]. As a result, we hypothesized that
knockout of Cx26 would contribute to increased tumour
size but this was not the case as the average tumor growth
rates were similar in Cre- and Cre+ DMBA-treated mice
both before and after Cx26 knockout. However, as Cx26
was absent or down-regulated even in the majority of Cretumors, it remains likely that Cx26 is down-regulated
in tumors early in primary tumour progression; this is
supported by studies suggesting that Cx26 may be, at least
in part, methylated to induce down-regulation [16, 43].
Ultimately, as the Cx26 status was similar in tumors from
Cre- and Cre+ mice our assessment of the role of Cx26
in primary tumour growth is limited. However, Cx26
and tumour growth may not be as critical in the human
context as the majority, but not all [20], of studies agree
that Cx26 mRNA or protein expression does not correlate
with tumour size or Ki67 status [44-47]. The overall role
of connexins in breast tumorigenesis has recently become
more complex as one recent study suggests that the
previously undetected Cx30, Cx32 and Cx46 may also be
expressed in human breast tissue [47].
DMBA-induced mammary tumors are often
associated with multiple gene expression profiles giving
rise to tumors with varying histological subtypes,
particularly squamous carcinomas and adenocarcinomas,
with many tumors expressing both luminal and basal cell
markers [28, 48, 49]. Others have demonstrated a link
37193

between human histological subtypes correlating with
specific genetic alterations, such as the inactivation of
the CDH1 gene that encodes E-cadherin and is frequently
found in lobular carcinomas of the breast [50]. Importantly,
there is some evidence that this correlation exists when
modelling tumorigenesis in mice as Derkson et al. showed
that mammary specific deletion of E-cadherin and p53
resulted in mammary tumors similar to lobular carcinomas
[51]. We aimed to test whether loss of Cx26 would promote
a greater propensity of developing mammary tumors of a
specific histological subtype. Interestingly, in both tumors
from Cre+ and Cre- mice we observed a wide variety
of histological subtypes supported by varied expression
of luminal and myoepithelial markers. Therefore, this
suggests that the loss of Cx26 prior to DMBA treatment
does not promote the development of mammary tumors of
specific histological subtype, which is in agreement with
a lack of correlation in human data of Cx26 expression
with any histological subtypes [20]. In addition, a majority
of studies document a lack of correlation between Cx26
and estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor and HER2
status in microarray or immunohistochemical analysis
of human tumour samples [45, 47, 51], although a
couple of exceptions have been reported in the case of
progesterone receptor [20] and estrogen receptor status
[45]. Importantly, our immunofluorescent assessment of
Cx43 revealed a more intracellular and diffuse labelling
pattern suggesting a potential reduction in the ability of
the mammary tumor cells to undergo GJIC. While this was
observed in mammary tumors from both Cre+ and Cremice, a potential role for Cx43 in regulating tumors cannot
be unequivocally excluded in mice with Cx26 knockout as
Cx43 has also been suggested to act as a tumor suppressor
[15].

In addition, Cx43 was also reduced compared to primary
tumors suggesting that Cx43 is down-regulated as tumors
progress towards metastasis consistent with Cx43 as
a breast cancer metastasis suppressor [21]. Of note, the
average lung tumour area from Cre- mice appeared larger
than those from Cre+ mice although the N-values were
too low for a statistically assessment. While this finding
hints that lung tumors without Cre-mediated deletion of
Cx26 may grow larger or establish themselves earlier
than those from Cre+ mice, we observed no evidence
that Cre- lung tumors upregulated their Cx26 expression.
As a consequence, our results do not support either a
tumour suppressive or facilitating role for Cx26 similar to
finding by Chao et al. who found no correlation between
upregulated Cx26 expression from primary tumors and
metastasis to the lung in human breast cancer patient
samples [52]. Taken together, our results support a tumour
suppressive role for Cx26 in the context of primary tumour
onset but this does not coincide with more aggressive
tumors or more frequent metastases in our chemicallyinduced model of breast cancer.

Implications to human disease
To date, GJB2 gene mutations give rise most
notably to syndromic and non-syndromic hearing loss
with comparable carrier frequencies to other prevalent
genetic diseases such as cystic fibrosis and sickle-cell
anemia [23]. In addition to hearing loss, many patients
will present with skin diseases including Bart-Pumphrey
syndrome, Hystrix-like icthyosis with deafness, Vohwinkel
syndrome and Keratitis ichthyosis deafness (KID) [54,
55]. Despite these skin diseases being relatively rare,
patients presenting with Vohwinkel syndrome and KID
syndrome have also been reported to develop skin tumors
[56]. Most intriguing, a review of 61 patients with KID
reported that ~10% of patients developed squamous cell
carcinoma suggesting that loss of functional Cx26 in the
skin predisposes KID syndrome patients to skin cancer
[57]. Although it remains unknown whether other tissues
or organs that commonly express Cx26 are also susceptible
to developing tumors, a single patient presenting with
KID syndrome also presented with a primary invasive
sccirrhous ductal carcinoma of the breast suggesting
that a loss-of-function mutant of Cx26 may also have
contributed to the onset of a primary breast tumour in
humans similar to our conditional Cx26 knockout mouse
model of breast cancer [58]. However, although our results
suggest an increased breast cancer risk to patients with loss
of function GJB2 mutations, it is important to note that
our mouse model does not recapitulate all Cx26 mutants.
Many are reported to have gain-of-functions, particularly
those associated with skin diseases, with increased Cx26
hemichannel function in addition to loss of gap junction
channel function [24]. As a result, our findings may
extend to only a subpopulation of patients with loss-of-

Cx26 knockout does not promote metastatic
dissemination to the lungs
The role of Cx26 in breast cancer metastasis remains
much more controversial than that in the primary tumour
particularly in studies using human samples. Some suggest
that Cx26 expression does not correlate with lymph node
positivity [20] or overall survival [45, 47] while others
have found that higher expression of Cx26 is associated
with poor overall patient survival [53], particularly if
Cx26 expression is elevated after chemotherapy [46].
Still others have found that Cx26 is upregulated in lymph
node metastases compared to matched primary tumors
[19]. While our results are limited by the number of mice
that developed potential lung metastases, we found no
evidence of Cx26 expression in any lung tumors similar
to the primary tumors. Thus, the knockout of Cx26 prior to
DMBA treatment did not predispose the mammary gland
to an increased frequency of metastases suggesting that
Cx26 is not acting as a breast cancer metastasis suppressor.

function GJB2 gene mutations. Therefore, we recommend
a large epidemiologic study of breast cancer frequency in
patients with loss-of-function GJB2 mutations compared
to familial healthy controls. In that over 1% of the general
population worldwide are estimated to be carriers of
mutant alleles of GJB2 it remains critical to determine if
this population as a whole, or in part, are at an increased
risk of developing breast cancer [23].

of 1cm3. Finally, five BLG-Cre; Cx26fl/fl and Cx26fl/fl mice
that had undergone at least 2 pregnancies were monitored
for spontaneous mammary tumour formation for 1.5 years
in which tissue was collected similar to that described
above. All mice were genotyped for the Cre transgene and
mammary gland cryosections were immunolabelled at the
time of sacrifice for the presence of Cx26 revealing Cx26
knockout even after 1 year of the experiment (SFig 1C).

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Whole Mount
Whole mounts were performed similar to how
we have previously described [61]. Briefly, mammary
glands were dissected and flattened onto a glass slide
before being placed into Carnoy’s fixative (100% EtOH,
chloroform, glacial acetic acid; 6:3:1) overnight at 4ºC.
Glands were immersed in 70% ethanol for 15 min and
then transferred to descending concentrations of ethanol
before being placed in carmine alum stain overnight at
room temperature. Glands were put through increasing
concentrations of ethanol and into xylene overnight.
Glands were then placed in methyl salicylate for long term
storage. Images were captured using a numeric camera
(Sony Cybershot).

Mice
All experimental procedures were approved by
the Committee on the Ethics of Animal Experiments at
the University of Western Ontario and the University of
British Columbia following the guidelines of the Canadian
Council on Animal Care. To assess how loss of Cx26
would affect primary mammary tumour development,
we utilized a conditional knockout mouse where the Cre
transgene was under the control of the β-lactoglobulin
(BLG) promoter [25]. In order to induce activation of the
BLG promoter and subsequent Cx26 knockout, a pituitary
isograft was surgically inserted into the renal capsule
(SFig 1A) of 6 week old BLG-Cre; Cx26fl/fl (Cre+) similar
to that described by others [59, 31] in addition to Cx26fl/
fl
(Cre-) control mice lacking the Cre transgene. Prolactin
and ovarian hormones derived from the pituitary transplant
triggers epithelial proliferation and lobuloalveolar
differentiation in the mammary gland. The presence
of milk proteins following pituitary isograft have been
reported between 21-40 days following surgery, in which
we observed the presence of milk in the mammary glands
approximately 50 days after pituitary implantation [60,
31]. This suggests that the activation of the BLG promoter
occurs between 3-7 weeks in parallel with lobuloalveolar
development (SFig1B). As such, in an attempt to induce
mammary tumors in mice in which Cx26 knockout had
occurred, Cre+ and Cre- mice, in which pituitaries were
implanted 12 weeks prior, were treated once a week with
the carcinogen 7,12-dimethylbenz(α)anthracene (DMBA)
or corn oil for 5 weeks (1mg per 25g) by gavage (STable
1). In addition, a second experiment was performed to
act as a control in which 6 week old BLG-Cre; Cx26fl/
fl
and Cx26fl/fl mice were treated with DMBA or corn oil
by gavage only 1 week following pituitary transplant
in order to induce mammary tumors in mice prior to
Cx26 knockout (STable 2). All mice were subsequently
monitored weekly by palpation for evidence of mammary
tumour formation. Mice were removed from the study if
they presented with other health concerns that included
developing lymphoma and/or stomach tumors that
required them to be sacrificed (STable 1, 2). Mice were
sacrificed when the largest tumors reached a final volume

Hematoxylin and eosin staining
Dissected mammary tumors, mammary glands
and lungs were fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin
and embedded in paraffin wax. Sections (6µm) were
deparaffinized in xylene (2x5min) and rehydrated in
descending concentrations of ethanol (2x100%, 95%,
70%; 5min) before being placed in ddH2O (2x3min).
Tissues were then stained in 1% Harris’s Hematoxylin for
1 min before being washed in tap water and differentiated
in acid ethanol. Slides were dipped in 70% ethanol (30sec)
and put into alcoholic Eosin (2min) and finally placed back
into 70% ethanol (2x30sec). Slides were then dehydrated
and mounted using Cytoseal. Images were captured using
a Brightfield microscope equipped with a ProgRes C5
camera (Jenoptik) and ProgRes Mac CapturePro 2.7.6
imaging software. Multiple rounds of sectioning and
staining were used to evaluate lung histology for evidence
of lung metastases. Clusters of nuclei in intimate proximity
with bronchioles, typical of bronchus associated lymphatic
tissue, were not included in the quantification of lung
tumors. Lung tumour area was evaluated by measuring
the length and width of lung tumors which were used to
determine the area of an ellipse using ImageJ and the area
of multiple lung tumors per mouse was averaged (National
Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD).

differentiation or with significant amounts of spindle cells.
Any tumors that presented outside of the previous three
groups was considered a miscellaneous tumour. All tumors
were evaluated in a blinded fashion.

Paraffin-embedded sections (6 µm) were
deparaffinized in xylene and dehydrated in descending
concentrations of ethanol before being placed in ddH20.
Antigen retrieval was performed using either antigen
unmasking solution (Vector Labs; microwaved for 5 min
at 80% power) or by immersing slides in sub-boiling 1.8
mM citric acid and 8.2 mM of sodium citrate solution
for 10 minutes before placing slides in an additional
0.01M Tris-0.001M EDTA antigen retrieval solution
sub-boiling for 20 min. Cryosections were cut with
a cryostat (8um) and stored at -80C and were fixed for
15 min in 10% neutral buffered formalin before use. All
tissue sections were rinsed in PBS for 5 min and blocked
with 3% BSA in PBS with 0.02% Triton X-100. Sections
were immunolabelled with the primary antibodies
mouse anti-Cx26 (1:100, Invitrogen, 13-8100) or rabbit
anti-Cx26 (Cryosections, 1:100, Invitrogen, 51-2800),
rabbit anti-Cx43 (1:400 dilution, Sigma, C6219), rabbit
anti-keratin8 (1:400, Abcam, ab53280 ), mouse anticytokeratin 14 (1:200, Thermo Scientific, Ms-115-P),
and rabbit anti-keratin 10 (1:400, Thermo Scientific, MS
611-P1), mouse anti-E-cadherin (1:400, BD Transduction
Laboratories, 610182), mouse anti-β-catenin (1:400, BD
Transduction Laboratories, 610154), α-smooth muscle
actin (1:400, Sigma, A5228) overnight at 4ºC. Sections
were washed in PBS and then probed with Alexa Fluor®
555-conjugated anti-rabbit or anti-mouse (1:400 dilution,
Molecular Probes, A21425 or A21429) and Alexa Fluor®
488-conjugated anti-rabbit or anti-mouse (1:400 dilution,
Molecular Probes, A11008 or A11017) secondary
antibodies for 1 hour at room temperature. Hoechst 33342
was used to label the nuclei and slides were mounted
with Airvol. Images were captured using a Leica DM
IRE2 inverted epifluorescence microscope and Velocity
imaging software. Qualitative assessment of 5-10 images
throughout mammary tumors were used to determine
the percentage of cells expressing epithelial markers and
connexins.

Statistical analysis
All statistical tests were performed using Graphpad
Prism 4 (v. 4.02). For analysis of the percent of tumour
free mice over time curves, a logrank test was applied.
Palpable tumour onset, average number of tumors per
mouse and average growth rate were evaluated using a
two tailed student’s unpaired t-test. A p value less than
0.05 was considered significant.
