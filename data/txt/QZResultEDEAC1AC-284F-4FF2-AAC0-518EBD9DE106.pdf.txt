Abstract
Multiple myeloma (MM) remains incurable despite much progress that has
been made in the treatment of the disease. MM cancer stem cell (MMSC), a rare
subpopulation of MM cells with the capacity for self-renewal and drug resistance, is
considered to lead to disease relapse. Several markers such as side population (SP)
and ALDH1+ have been used to identify MMSCs. However, ideally and more precisely,
the identification of the MMSCs should rely on MMSCs phenotype. Unfortunately the
MMSC phenotype has not been properly defined yet. Drug resistance is the most
important property of MMSCs and contributes to disease relapse, but the mechanisms
of drug resistance have not been fully understood. The major signaling pathways
involved in the regulation of self-renewal and differentiation of MMSCs include
Hedgehog (Hh), Wingless (Wnt), Notch and PI3K/Akt/mTOR. However, the precise
role of these signaling pathways needs to be clarified. It has been reported that the
microRNA profile of MMSCs is remarkably different than that of non-MMSCs. Therefore,
the search for targeting MMSCs has also been focused on microRNAs. Complex and
mutual interactions between the MMSC and the surrounding bone marrow (BM)
microenvironment sustain self-renewal and survival of MMSC. However, the required
molecules for the interaction of the MMSC and the surrounding BM microenvironment
need to be further identified. In this review, we summarize the current state of
knowledge of MMSCs regarding their phenotype, mechanisms of drug resistance,
signaling pathways that regulate MMSCs self-renewal and differentiation, abnormal
microRNAs expression, and their interactions with the BM microenvironment.

INTRODUCTION

in 1997 in acute myeloid leukemia when Bonnet et al.
noticed that a rare population of CD34+CD38- possess
tumorigenic potential [10]. Subsequently, CSCs were
identified in various solid and hematological tumors,
including MM [11-15]. Although much progress in the
biology and treatment of MM cancer stem cell (MMSC)
has been made, there are still many questions to answer,
such as what is the MMSC phenotype, what is the precise
mechanism of their drug resistance, what are the precise
roles and relationships of signaling pathways involved in
maintaining the properties of MMSCs, what are the roles
of microRNAs in MMSCs, and what are the required
molecules for the interaction of the MMSC and the
surrounding BM microenvironment. Further elucidation
of the characteristics of MMSCs could lead to innovative
strategies that could make MM a curable disease.

Multiple myeloma (MM) is a hematologic cancer
characterized by proliferation of clonal plasma cells
in the bone marrow (BM) resulting in the secretion of
monoclonal immunoglobulins [1, 2]. MM is the second
most common hematologic malignancy with an incidence
ranging from 4 to 6 per 100,000/year in the USA [35]. Together with autologous stem cell transplantation
and advances in supportive care, the introduction
of novel drugs such as proteasome inhibitors and
immunomodulatory drugs have significantly improved
response rates and survival rates in patients with MM
[6, 7]. However, MM remains incurable. Cancer stem
cells (CSCs) are believed to be the major cause of tumor
recurrence [8, 9]. Although the concept of CSCs has been
around for decades, CSCs were only definitely described

MMSCS CONCEPTS

BM microenvironment was reconstructed in vitro. In the
3-D model, drug-resistant CD20+ cells exhibited selfrenewal potential, and gave rise to clonotypic B and
plasma cell progeny in colony assays. The above studies
imply that clonotypic B cells may be involved in the MM
disease but offer no definitive evidence that clonotypic B
cells represent the MMSCs.

Although many investigations have tried to
identify the MMSCs phenotype, there is still controversy
on the MMSCs phenotype. The major viewpoint is
that the clonotypic CD138− cells represent MMSCs
[16]. However, some investigations demonstrated that
clonotypic CD138+ plasma cells have the properties of
CSCs such as self-renewal, tumour-initiating potential
and drug resistance [17]. Besides these two viewpoints,
some investigators found that the interconversion between
undifferentiated and differentiated clonotypic cells might
be responsible for maintaining the properties of MMSCs
[18]. The exact reasons for the discrepancies in reported
MMSC phenotypes are unclear. It is likely that differences
between clonogenic assays contribute to these disparate
findings. In addition, it is possible that MM represents a
number of biologically distinct diseases each containing
different stem cells. Side population (SP) cells have
generally been accepted to have characteristics of CSCs.
They have been widely used to sort some types of CSCs
of which phenotype has not been defined [19, 20]. In
myeloma research, SP cells are the important source to
research MMSCs.

Clonotypic non B cells plasma cells
Many studies also have documented the clonogenic
potential of non B cell plasma cells. Yaccoby et al.
demonstrated that CD38++CD45− MM plasma cells
grew and produced MM and its manifestations in severe
combined immunodeficiency (SCID) mice implanted in
human fetal bone (SCID-hu mice) [24] or in rabbit femurs
(SCID-rab mice) [25]. In contrast, the plasma cell-depleted
BM cells did not grow or produce MM in SCID-hu mice.
Similarly, plasma-cell-containing blood cells grew and
developed into MM disease in SCID-hu mice, while the
plasma cells depleted of blood cells weren’t able to grow in
SCID-hu mice, demonstrating the proliferative potential of
MM plasma cells. Kim et al. [17] identified MM-initiating
cells by transplanting fractionated BM cells from patients
with MM into human bone-bearing immunocompromised
mice. They found that CD38high /CD138+ cells repopulated
B-lineage cells in human bone grafts, and these grafts
were clonally derived from patient myeloma cells. In their
experiment models, only fully differentiated CD38high/
CD138+ plasma cells were capable of engrafting and
serially transferring the disease to secondary recipients,
indicating fully differentiated CD38high/CD138+ plasma
cells are enriched in myeloma-initiating cells. Hosen et
al. [26] reported that CD138−CD19−CD38++ plasma cells
were able to form MM colonies in vitro, while CD19+ B
cells never formed MM colonies in 16 samples examined
in their study. Furthermore, CD138−CD19−CD38++
plasma cells isolated from 3 out of 9 patients engrafted
in the SCID-rab model produced MM, while CD19+ B
cells did not induce MM growth. CD138+ plasma cells
isolated from 4 out of 9 patients developed MM, although
more slowly than CD138− cells. Finally, CD19+ B cells
from 13 patients with MM transplanted into NOD/SCID
IL2Rγc−/− mice did not propagate MM. Their data showed
that in some patients with MM plasma cells but not B
cells were enriched with CD138− clonogenic cells, and
that MM plasma cells could develop MM in vivo in the
absence of CD19+ B cells. Paino et al. [27] examined in
several MM cell lines the presence and functionality of
CD20+ putative MMSCs. Only a very rare population of
CD20dim+ cells (0.3%) in the RPMI-8226 cell line was
detected. Furthermore, CD20dim+ RPMI-8226 cells were
not essential for CB17-SCID mice engraftment and had
lower self-renewal capacity than the CD20− RPMI-8226
cells. Their data showed that CD20 may not be a marker
of MMSCs. Trepel et al. [28] established a novel approach

Clonotypic B cell
Matsui et al. [16] found that CD138− cells from both
human MM cell lines and primary patient samples had
greater clonogenic potential both in vitro and in non obese
diabetic/severe combined immunodeficiency (NOD/SCID)
mice, compared to corresponding CD138+ plasma cells.
Furthermore, these CD138− cells were able to differentiate
into CD138+ plasma cells and phenotypically resembled
postgerminal center B cells, and their clonogenic growth
could be inhibited by the anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody
rituximab. These data imply that CD138− B cells contained
the properties of MMSCs. Matsui et al. [21] further found
that CD138− B cells were resistant to clinical anti-MM
agents (dexamethasone, lenalidomide, bortezomib, and
4-hydroxycyclophosphamide) and possessed a high
drug efflux capacity and intracellular drug detoxification
activity. They also found that CD19+CD27+CD138− with
a memory B-cell phenotype could engraft NOD/SCID
mice during both primary and secondary transplantation.
Furthermore, both the side population and Aldefluor
assays were able to identify CD19+CD27+CD138− B cells
within the peripheral blood of patients with MM. Boucher
et al. [22] reported that CD19+CD34+ immature B cells
and CD19+CD34− mature cells, but not CD19−CD34+
cells isolated from the BM of patients with MM showed
colony formation activity and resistance to melphalan,
lenalidomide, and bortezomib, indicating undifferentiated
clonotypic B cells may represent MMSCs. Kirshner et al.
[23] presented a 3-D culture model in which the human

that directly tracked clonotypic B cells in 15 patients with
MM. They found clonotypic B cells in only one out of 15
patients with MM, indicating clonotypic B cells represent
a very small population in MM. Chiron et al. [29] showed
that the peripheral CD138+CD20− population contains
MMSC activity in patients with plasma cell leukemia,
which is an aggressive presentation of MM with highlevel proliferation. They further found that this population
supported the establishment of human MM cell lines.

believed to play a critical role in tumour maintenance and
reoccurrence. Loh et al. [35] found that SP cells were
present in MM cell lines as well as primary MM cells.
Matsui et al. [21] showed that in human MM cell lines,
SP cells were almost exclusively CD138−. However,
Jakubikova et al. [30] reported the conflicting results
that SP cells were mainly present in CD138low+ and
CD138+ populations in MM cell lines, suggesting that
SP cells express CD138 antigen. Moreover, they found
no correlation between expression of CD19, CD20, or
CD27 and the proportion of SP cells. These data were
supported by the findings of Chaidos et al. [18] that
showed MMSC activity is a property shared by both
CD19−CD138− cells and CD19−CD138+ plasma cells but
not CD19+CD138− clonotypic B cells. SP cells exhibit
substantial heterogeneity in a panel of MM cell lines
and primary MM cells; Moreover, SP cells revealed a
higher tumorigenicity and proliferation index than main
population (MP) cells [30]. Although results regarding SP
cells seems to be convincing, the approach for selection
of SP has been questioned. The dye Hoechst 33342 has
lethal effect on living cells, which is why SP cells might
represent only a population that survived the toxic effect of
Hoechst 33342 [31]. Montanaro et al. [36] demonstrated
that yield, viability, and homogeneity of SP cells were
affected by the isolation parameters, such as staining time,
dye concentration, cellular concentration and stringency
in the selection of SP cells. In addition, they also reported
that the use of verapamil as an inhibitor of efflux does not
seem to be specific enough, since a small proportion of
verapamil-sensitive cells are present in the SP gate.

Phenotypic and functional plasticity between
undifferentiated and differentiated clonotypic
cells
The unidirectional hierarchical model from
undifferentiated cells to differentiated cells ignores now
available data that shows differentiated MM plasma cells
possess a clonogenic capacity. Jakubikova et al. [30] found
that SP cells express CD138 antigen in MM cell lines,
indicating CD138+ differentiated cells have clonogenic
capacity. There is growing evidence of interconversion
between undifferentiated and differentiated clonotypic
cells and these might be present and responsible for
phenotypic diversities and maintaining of MMSCs features
[18, 31, 32]. Chaidos et al. [18] showed that CD19−
CD138+ plasma cell (PC) and CD19−CD138− cell (termed
Pre-PC) represent reversible, bidirectional phenotypic
and functional states and share MMSC activity. In their
experiment, 9 of 12 MM patient-derived highly purified
CD138high PCs displayed bone marrow engraftment, which
is able to engraft in secondary transplants, indicating
CD138+ PCs possess MMSCs activity. Additionally, both
Pre-PCs and CD138+/low PCs were identified in BM of
mice receiving highly purified CD138 high PCs, strongly
supporting a PC to Pre-PC transition. When they assessed
the drug resistance of PCs and Pre-PCs, they found PrePCs are much more drug-resistant than PCs although
both PCs and Pre-PCs excluded vital dye in an equally
efficient manner. These findings were very attractive
and imply phenotypic and functional plasticity between
undifferentiated and differentiated clonotypic cells.
The plasticity could better explain why differentiated
MM plasma cells possess a clonogenic capacity and
also reconcile inconsistencies among the MM stem cell
phenotype.

DRUG RESISTANCE
Conventional cytotoxic chemotherapeutic agents are
capable of producing initial responses. The introduction
of novel agents such as thalidomide, lenalidomide,
bortezomib and carfilzomib have significantly improved
clinical responses and overall survival in patients with
MM [37-40]. Furthermore, synergistic effects have been
clarified when these agents are used in combination
treatment. Even with more available therapeutic options,
a vast majority of patients with MM eventually relapse.
The treatment failure demonstrates current agents are
ineffective in eradicating the most drug-resistant MM cells
[41]. The high drug efflux capacity of MMSCs is likely
to be the major cause of drug resistance in myeloma [20,
21]. Circulating clonotypic B cells have been shown to
persist and increase after chemotherapy [42-44]. In order
to overcome drug resistance of MMSCs and develop
innovative strategies, mechanisms of drug resistances
strongly need to be clarified.

SP cells
SP cells were originally identified in murine BM and
referred to cells with the capacity to efflux the fluorescent
dye Hoechst 33342 [33, 34]. SP cells have been identified
in a variety of tissues and cancer cell lines. These cells
share characteristics of CSCs, specifically, they possess
tumorigenic potential, express stem-like genes, and resist
to chemotherapeutic drugs [20]. This is why SP cells are

ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters

aldehyde intermediates. This is one of the major reasons
why chemotherapy agents are not effective against CSCs
expressing ALDH [57]. The number of CSCs expressing
ALDH increased after chemotherapy [58]. Raha et al. [59]
evaluated the role of ALDH in the maintenance of CSCs.
They found that ALDH protected the CSCs from the
toxic effects of elevated levels of reactive oxygen species
(ROS), and that inhibition of ALDH activity decreased the
proportion of CSCs and delayed treatment relapse in vitro
and in vivo through accumulation of ROS to toxic levels,
consequent DNA damage, and cell apoptosis.

ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters represent
one family of transmembrane proteins. These transporter
proteins use the energy from ATP hydrolysis to efflux
cytotoxic compounds across the membrane, which is
believed to be one of the major causes of multidrug
resistance in cancer therapy [45]. In MM, SP cells show
stronger activity of the ABC transporter ABCG2 when
compared to MP cells. Moreover, inhibition of ABCG2
could decrease SP proportion. Other ABC transporters
are also involved in the SP cells, an example of this is
the high levels of ABCC1 were that were detected in
the SP cells of the KMS-11 line. Similarly, high levels
of ABCB1 were detected in SP cells of doxorubicinresistant RPMI-Dox40 cells [30]. ABCC3 was increased
in SP cells compared with MP cells in human primary
MM samples, and mediated drug resistance in MM cells
[46]. The expression of ABCB1 was upregulated in MM
cells overexpressing bruton tyrosine kinase (BTK) and
endowed these cells with drug resistance [47]. Hawley
et al. [48] found that upregulation of ABCB1 expression
was associated with high transporter activity. HirschmannJax et al. demonstrated that expression of ABCB3 was
associated with drug resistance of stem cells [49].

Increased expression of anti-apoptotic genes
Chemotherapeutic agents function by inducing
apoptosis. The balance of pro- and anti-apoptotic
proteins affected the apoptotic response of cells to
these chemotherapeutic agents. Increased expression
of anti-apoptotic proteins and decreased expression of
pro-apoptotic proteins confer cells drug resistance. Our
previous study demonstrated that higher expression of
retinoic acid receptor alpha 2 (RARα2) was observed in the
MMSC compartment and this resulted in increased drug
resistance. Further research showed that the expression
of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family members increased in
MMSCs expressing RARα2 and endowed these cells with
increased drug resistance [46]. More recently, we reported
that expression of BTK was increased in MMSCs, and
overexpression of BTK induced drug resistance, which
was partially mediated by upregulation of anti-apoptotic
gene BCL-2 [47].

ALDH
ALDH (aldehyde dehydrogenase) catalyzes the
chemical transformation from acetaldehyde to acetic acid.
Upregulation of ALDH expression has been detected in
normal adult stem cells. ALDH is commonly deregulated
in many tumors. Increased expression of ALDH in cancer
is associated with increased stemness and poor clinical
outcome [21, 50-54]. Matsui et al. [21] found that in
RPMI 8226 and NCI-H929 cell lines, CD138− cells
exhibited significantly higher levels of ALDH activity
than CD138+ plasma cells. Furthermore, they showed that
majority of the ALDH+ B cells isolated from the peripheral
blood of patients with MM express clonotypic surface
Ig light chain and CD27, which were similar to the SP
B cells. Our previous study demonstrated that ALDH1+
MM cells had much stronger capacities of proliferation
and tumorigenicity, compared to ALDH1− MM cells.
Moreover, we found that ALDH1+ MM cells highly
expressed chromosomal instability genes associated with
drug resistance [55]. More recently, we demonstrate that
member A1 of the ALDH1 family of proteins, ALDH1A1,
was up-regulated in the course of myeloma therapy and
progression, and that enforced expression of ALDH1A1
led to both increased tumorigenicity and resistance to two
widely used myeloma drugs (doxorubicin, bortezomib)
in vitro and in vivo [56]. When CSCs were treated
with certain chemotherapy agents, they produced toxic
aldehyde intermediates. ALDH could detoxify these toxic

Cellular quiescence
Cellular quiescence is a property of hematopoietic
stem cells and is thought to play a crucial role in protecting
stem cells [60]. Similar to normal stem cells, CSCs have
a slow cycling rate and are relatively quiescent. This
property protects CSCs against chemotherapeutic agents
that are effective in targeting all dividing cells [58]. This
property has been conjectured to be a major mechanism of
drug resistance. Matsui et al. [21] evaluated whether MM
precursors are relatively quiescent. They isolated CD138−
MM cells and CD138+ MM cells from the RPMI 8226 and
NCI-H929 cell lines and used propidium iodide to detect
their cell cycle status. They found that the proportion
of the CD138− MM cells in G0-G1 is much higher than
that of CD138+ MM cells, indicating that CD138− MM
cells are relatively quiescent. These results are consistent
with Fuhler et al.’study. In their study, CD138− MM cells
have a reduced activity of kinases involved in cell cycle
progression and slower G1/S phase transition compared
to CD138+ MM cells [61]. Chaidos et al. [18] found that
CD19−CD138+ PCs and CD19−CD138− Pre-PCs fractions
harbor MMSC activity and display different resistance to

treatment (Pre-PCs being more drug-resistant than PCs).
Both PCs and Pre-PCs lacked surface expression of the
drug efflux proteins ABCB1 and ABCG2, demonstrating
that ABC transporters might be not responsible for their
different resistance to treatment. Further research showed
that Pre-PCs were more quiescent than PCs, revealed by
the lower proportion of Pre-PCs in S phase of cell cycle,
suggesting that cellular quiescence may be involved in
drug resistance. The above findings imply that MMSCs
resistant to chemotherapeutics may be mediated by
cellular quiescence.

data demonstrated that targeting Wnt signaling pathway
represents a therapeutic approach in the treatment of MM.
Our previous studies [46, 47] found that β-Catenin, TCF4
and LEF1 expression increased in SP cells compared
to MP cells. Wnt inhibition overcame drug resistance.
Moreover, Wnt inhibition reduced the myeloma tumor
burden and increased survival in the 5TGM1 mouse
model.

SIGNALING PATHWAYS

Hh signaling molecules include Hh ligands (Sonic
Hh, Indian Hh and Desert Hh), the transmembrane
receptor patched (PTCH), the signal transducer
smoothened (SMO) and transcription factors (GLI1, GLI2,
GLI3). In the absence of Hh ligand, PTCH inhibits SMO
and renders the pathway inactive. When ligands bind
PTCH, SMO is de-repressed and then leads to activation
of the three GLI proteins that act as transcriptional
regulators that regulate target gene expression. GLI1
acts as positive effector of Hh signaling and induces the
transcription of Hh target genes. GLI3 acts as negative
effector of Hh signaling by repressing the transcription of
Hh target genes, while GLI2 can act as either positive or
negative effector, depending on both post-transcriptional
and post-translational modifications [73, 74]. The Hh
signaling pathway is involved in the regulation of cell
differentiation, proliferation, stem cell maintenance,
and carcinogenesis [73, 75, 76]. Aberrant Hh signaling
activation may be implicated in many types of cancer,
including skin, leukemia, lung, brain, and gastrointestinal
cancers [73]. Peacock et al. [77] investigated the role
and mechanisms of Hh pathway activation in MM. They
found that Hh pathway activity is mainly concentrated
within the CD138−CD19+ MMSCs compartment but not
in the CD138+CD19− MM plasma cells. Stroma-derived
Hh ligands promote proliferation of MMSCs without
differentiation, while inhibition of Hh pathway markedly
inhibits clonal proliferation accompanied by terminal
differentiation of purified MMSCs. These data revealed
that Hh pathway activation is heterogeneous between
MMSCs and differentiated MM cells, and that Hh pathway
activation plays a crucial role in maintaining MMSCs in an
undifferentiated, clonally expansion state. More recently,
Liu et al. [78] reported that CD138+ MM cells are a major
source of Hh ligand SHH and autocrine SHH enhanced
MM cells proliferation and drug resistance, indicating
that the myeloma autocrine Hh signaling pathway was a
promising therapeutic target in MM.

Hedgehog

Wingless (Wnt) pathway is a classic “stemness”
pathway, which plays a crucial role in normal adult stem
cells as well as CSCs of many cancer types [62]. Hedgehog
(Hh) pathway is typically active in hematopoietic stem
cells and CSCs [63]. The Notch pathway promotes
CSCs [64, 65]. These pathways are also highly active
in MMSCs and may be responsible for the maintenance
and sustainability of MM. Additionally, PI3K/Akt/mTOR
pathway is critical for survival and has also been shown
to be aberrantly active in CSCs [66]. Increased evidence
demonstrates that targeting these pathways individually
will not be sufficient to kill MMSCs; instead, rational
combinations of agents targeting these pathways in concert
could be of particular importance.

Wnt
The Wnt signaling pathway plays a significant role
in the regulation of cell proliferation, cell development
and the differentiation of normal stem cells. Constitutive
activation of Wnt signaling pathway is found in a variety
of human cancers [67, 68]. MM cells have been reported
to depend on an active Wnt signaling. The dysregulation
of Wnt signaling pathways resulted in promoting MM
cell proliferation, migration, invasion, drug resistance
and formation of MMSCs [46]. Wnt signaling sustains
stemness mainly by stabilizing β-Catenin and promoting
its translocation to the nucleus where it functions as
a transcription factor [69, 70]. Sukhdeo et al. [71]
demonstrated that Wnt signaling pathway genes were
up-regulated in MM cells. These included upstream
pathway genes such as frizzled and Wnt ligands, as well as
β-Catenin, TCF4, and BCL9, and a number of downstream
pathway members. In their study, PKF115-584, which
was a Wnt pathway inhibitor and could down-regulate
Wnt target genes and block β-Catenin/TCF transcriptional
activity, significantly reduced cell proliferation and
inhibited tumor growth. Zhao et al. [72] reported that the
microRNA miR-30-5p could reduce tumor burden and
metastatic potential in murine xenograft models of MM
through targeting Wnt/β-Catenin/BCL pathway. These

Notch
The Notch signaling pathway is activated in MM
cells, which leads to increased proliferation, resistance
to apoptosis and osteoclastogenesis [79-82]. Jundt et al.
35470

Oncotarget

[80] evaluated the pathogenetic role of Notch signaling
pathway in MM. They found that Notch receptors and
ligand Jagged1 were highly expressed in cultured and
primary MM cells. Furthermore, Jadded1-induced Notch
signaling strongly promoted MM cell growth. Nefedova
et al. [83] reported that targeting Notch signaling via
its specific inhibitorγ-secretase inhibitor (GSI) induced
apoptosis of MM cells and inhibited tumor growth in
xenograft and SCID-hu models of MM. Additionally,
inhibition of Notch signaling enhances MM cell sensitivity
to chemotherapeutic drugs such as doxorubicin and
melphalan. Mirandola et al. [84] demonstrated that Notch
signaling pathway plays a significant role in MM cell
lines through activating CXCR4/SDF-1 axis, and that
forced CXCR4 activation partially protects MM cells
from the outcomes of Notch inhibition. In addition, Notch
signaling blockage markedly reduces bone marrow (BM)

infiltration by human MM cells in mouse xenografts. Their
data showed that a Notch-targeted approach is effective in
preventing MM cell migration, proliferation and survival.
More recently, Colombo et al. [85] presented evidence
that MM induced osteoclastogenesis by activating Notch
signaling on tumor cells and osteoclasts through Jagged
ligands expression. Silencing tumor-derived Jagged1 and
2 ligands could block MM-induced osteoclastogenesis.
These results suggest that Notch signaling plays a key
role in osteoclastogenesis and is a promising therapeutic
target in MM to prevent bone disease. Great expression
of Notch signaling has been detected in BM clonotypic B
cells from patients with MM [86]. However, the precise
roles of Notch signaling pathways remain to be further
investigated in MMSCs.

Figure 1: MMSCs-targeting therapy in combination with non-MMSCs therapy may offer a promising strategy for
management of myeloma. The promising approaches to eradicate MMSCs included: targeting surface markers, the required molecules

for the interaction of MMSC with BM microenvironment, signaling pathways that regulate MMSCs self-renewal and differentiation, ATP
binding cassette (ABC) transporters involved in drug resistance, manipulation of microRNA expression. Bulk MM cells might replenish
the MMSC pool after this pool has been eliminated if phenotypic and functional plasticity between MMSCs and bulk MM cells exists.
Consequently, curing myeloma will require a combined therapy that target both MMSCs and bulk MM cells. MM, multiple myeloma;

PI3K/Akt/mTOR

[86]. BMSCs secrete factors including interleukin 6 (IL6), insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1), RANK ligand
(RANKL), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), vascular
endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and stromal cellderived factor 1 alpha (SDF1) [84, 92, 93]. These factors
maintain normal cell function and stimulate MM cell
survival. The BM microenvironment is crucial for selfrenewal and survival of HSC. Interestingly, many of the
signaling pathways involved in sustaining HSC regulate
MM disease progression, indicating these signaling
pathways could potentially be hijacked by the MMSCs for
their self-renewal and survival [92, 94, 95]. BM hypoxia is
required for normal hematopoiesis. Similarly, BM hypoxia
is advantageous for the tumor-initiating CD45+ MM
cells in 5T2MM mouse MM models [96]. The MMSC
and the surrounding BM microenvironment interact in a
way that sustain long-term survival of the MMSC. The
identification of the required molecules for the interaction
of the MMSC and the surrounding BM microenvironment
will enable us to perturb their interactions and represent
a significant effort to eradicate MMSC from the BM
environment.

The PI3K/ Akt/mTOR signaling pathway is
aberrantly activated in many cancer types. A preferential
inhibitory effect on CSCs has been shown for some
mTOR inhibitors [87, 88]. PI3K/mTOR inhibitor VS-5584
preferentially reduced the proportion of CSCs in multiple
mouse xenograft models of human cancer. Mechanistic
research showed that coordinate RNAi-mediated silencing
of PI3Kα, PI3Kβ, and mTOR replicated the effect of
VS-5584, indicating that preferential targeting of CSCs
required inhibition of multiple components of the PI3K/
mTOR pathway [89]. PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway is
activated and play a critical role in MMSCs. Du et al. [90]
found that PI3K/Akt/mTOR signal transduction proteins
CAB39, TSC1, P - S6 and P - P70S6K expression levels
were significantly higher in SP cells of MM than that in
MP cells of MM. Moreover, the mTOR specific inhibitor
rapamycin can dramatically decrease the proportion of SP
cells of MM.

MICRORNAS IN MMSCS

CONCLUSIONs

MicroRNAs are small non-coding regulatory RNA
molecules which inhibit the expression of their target
genes at the translational level. The microRNA profile
between CSCs and non-CSCs is remarkably different.
Moreover, multiple microRNAs have been reported to
regulate properties of CSCs [91]. Du et al. [90] isolated
SP cells from MM cell lines and primary MM cells and
investigated the microRNA profile between SP cells and
MP cells, finding a total of 43 differentially expressed
microRNAs (10 over-expression and 33 low-expression
microRNAs) in SP cells. Among these differentially
expressed microRNAs, five were associated with MMSCs.
In addition, high expression of microRNA451 in SP cells
activated PI3K/mTOR signaling pathways. Inhibiting
the expression of microRNA451 induced apoptosis.
Zhao et al. [72] demonstrated that downregulation of
microRNA-30-5p could activate the oncogenic Wnt/βCatenin pathway which was one of most frequently active
pathways in MMSCs, implying that microRNA-30-5p
may regulate formation of MMSCs. The differential
microRNA profile in MMSCs made auxiliary biomarkers
for the identification of MMSCs possible and their role in
regulating the properties of MMSCs made them potential
targets for therapy.

In our opinion, MMSCs represent a significant effort
to effective cancer treatment. However, there is still a
pressing need to identify surface markers and understand
molecular feature associated with MMSCs. Global
gene expression profiling (GEP) is a powerful tool for
identifying new targets in cancers [97, 98]. Kiel et al. used
GEP to find the surface marker SLAM of leukemia stem
cell [99]. Similarly, our group used GEP to find promising
genes that were significantly differentially expressed in
CD138- cells compared to CD138+ cells from MM cell
lines [46, 47]. In the future, the discovery of MMSC
surface markers will help with the design of MMSCstargeting drug. In addition, further studies are needed
to explore the required molecules for the interaction of
the MMSC and the surrounding BM microenvironment.
MMSC has many similar signaling and receptors with
HSC. Therefore, while understanding the molecules
responsible for self-renewal and survival of the HSC in
the BM microenvironment, this can be applied to the
MMSC to potentially eradicate MMSC from the BM
microenvironment. We speculate that MMSCs-targeting
therapy in combination with non- MMSCs therapy, such
as conventional anti-MM drugs, may offer a promising
strategy for management and eradication of myeloma
(Figure 1).
