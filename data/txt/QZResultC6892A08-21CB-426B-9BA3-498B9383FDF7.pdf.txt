ABSTRACT:
Mutations in the NF2 gene cause Neurofibromatosis Type 2 (NF2), a disorder
characterized by the development of schwannomas, meningiomas and ependymomas
in the nervous system. Merlin, a tumor suppressor encoded by the NF2 gene, modulates
activity of many essential signaling pathways. Yet despite increasing knowledge of
merlin function, there are no NF2 drug therapies. In a pilot high-throughput screen
of the Library of Pharmacologically Active Compounds, we assayed for compounds
capable of reducing viability of mouse Schwann cells (MSC) with Nf2 inactivation as a
cellular model for human NF2 schwannomas. AGK2, a SIRT2 (sirtuin 2) inhibitor, was
identified as a candidate compound. SIRT2 is one of seven mammalian sirtuins that
are NAD+-dependent protein deacetylases. We show that merlin-mutant MSC have
higher expression levels of SIRT2 and lower levels of overall lysine acetylation than
wild-type control MSC. Pharmacological inhibition of SIRT2 decreases merlin-mutant
MSC viability in a dose dependent manner without substantially reducing wild-type
MSC viability. Inhibition of SIRT2 activity in merlin-mutant MSC is accompanied by
release of lactate dehydrogenase and high mobility group box 1 protein into the
medium in the absence of significant apoptosis, autophagy, or cell cycle arrest. These
findings suggest that SIRT2 inhibition triggers necrosis of merlin-mutant MSCs and
that SIRT2 is a potential NF2 drug target.

INTRODUCTION

Molecular studies of merlin’s mechanism of action have
revealed that merlin regulates signaling from mitogenic,
adhesion and extracellular matrix receptors through
many essential signaling pathways [5, 6]. However, the
pleotropic effect of merlin has made it difficult to identify
the most relevant drug targets.
As an alternative approach to drug discovery,
we conducted an unbiased high-throughput screen of
the library of Pharmacologically Active Compounds
(LOPAC) using viability of merlin-mutant mouse
Schwann cells (MSC) as a phenotypic assay to identify
potential compounds and pathways relevant to NF2
schwannoma treatment. One compound identified in
the screen was AGK2, a SIRT2 inhibitor. SIRT2 is one
of seven mammalian sirtuins, also known as class III
HDACs (histone deacetylases). Sirtuins are NAD(+)
dependent deacetylases, that remove the acetyl group
from the lysine’s epsilon-amine in a multi-step reaction[7,
8]. SIRT2 is mainly cytoplasmic and its known substrates

Neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2) is a benign tumor
disorder of the nervous system caused by mutations in
the NF2 gene that encodes a tumor suppressor called
schwannomin or merlin. The hallmark of NF2 is the
formation of bilateral schwannomas in the vestibular
branch of the auditory nerve. Patients frequently
develop additional schwannomas in other cranial, spinal
and peripheral nerves as well as meningiomas and
ependymomas. Common initial symptoms include hearing
loss, dizziness or imbalance; however life-threatening
compression of the brainstem also occurs [1]. The choices
for NF2 schwannoma treatments are surgical resection or
stereotactic radiosurgery. Many schwannomas however are
inoperable and surgery often causes complete loss of nerve
function, while radiosurgery carries an increased risk of a
future secondary malignancy [2]. Currently, a few clinical
trials of anti-cancer drugs are underway for NF2 [3, 4].

include: α-tubulin, partitioning defective 3 homolog
(PAR3), p53, K-RAS, histone H4K16, forkhead Box
O1 and 3a (FOXO1 and 3a) and RIP1 [9-14]. While
beneficial effects of SIRT2 inhibition was shown in
neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson’s and
Huntington’s disease, the role of SIRT2 in cancer remains
controversial [15, 16]. SIRT2 has been reported to
function as a tumor suppressor that is down-regulated in
some human gliomas; however, its function has also been
reported as essential for survival of C6 glioma cells. Small
molecule SIRT2 inhibitors have in some cases selectively
induced tumor cell death [17-21].
Here we validate AGK2 as a compound that
selectively reduces viability of merlin-mutant MSC
compared to normal MSCs. Moreover we demonstrate
increased expression levels of SIRT2 in merlin-mutant
versus normal MSCs that are associated with a general
reduction in lysine acetylation. Phenotypic mechanism of
action studies suggests that inhibition of SIRT2 in merlinmutant SCs triggers a necrotic pathway.

compared to control MSC (Fig. 1b). We confirmed these
differences with several independently derived merlinmutant MSC lines (Fig. 1c). We next immunoblotted for
glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH)
because tumor cells have altered metabolism and sirtuins
can influence metabolic and energetic regulation. We
found higher levels of GAPDH in merlin-mutant MSC
compared to MSC consistent with higher glycolytic
activity in merlin-mutant MSC than controls (Fig. 1c).
In order to validate the results in our cellular model, we
measured SIRT2 and acetyl-α-tubulin levels in a human
NF2 cell line created by immortalization of schwannoma
cells from a NF2 patient with the E6 and E7 genes of the
papillomavirus [25]. Similarly, we found higher levels of
SIRT2 in HEI-193 cells than in control human Schwann
cells which correlated with lower acetylated tubulin levels
in HEI-193 compared to control cells (Fig. 1d).
We localized SIRT2 in control and mutant cells
using immunofluorescence staining followed by confocal
microscopy. Both cells types expressed the Schwann cell
marker S100 and control MSC immunoreacted with the
N-terminal merlin antibody whereas the merlin-mutant
MSC did not. Both cell types expressed SIRT2 in the
cytosol and nuclei, however, merlin-mutant MSC in
general had higher levels of fluorescence intensity than
controls. Control MSC showed significantly higher levels
of acetylated tubulin compared to merlin-mutant MSC
and in the latter, the weak immunofluorescence signal for
acetylated tubulin was mostly perinuclear (Fig. 1e).
Lastly, we examined the expression of other sirtuin
family members by western blotting. SIRT5 was expressed
in control and mutant MSC at similar levels, whereas
SIRT1, SIRT3 and SIRT7 were expressed at higher levels
in merlin-mutant MSC than MSC (Fig. 1f).

RESULTS
Merlin-Mutant MSC Have Higher SIRT2 Levels
and Lower Lysine Acetylation Levels Than
Control MSC.
Merlin-mutant mouse Schwann cells (MSC)
contain a deletion of exon 2 of the Nf2 gene that replicates
a documented patient mutation. Merlin-mutant MSC
were created by in vitro adeno-Cre transduction of
mouse Schwann cells isolated from sciatic nerves of
homozygous Nf2flox2/flox2 mice as previously described [2224]. Using this NF2 cell model, we screened the Library
of Pharmacologically Active Compounds (LOPAC,
Sigma-Aldrich) searching for compounds capable of
reducing their viability. One of the initial hits we chose to
investigate was AGK2, a small molecule SIRT2 inhibitor.
The sirtuin family of deacetylases has not been examined
heretofore in NF2.
To visualize the lysine acetylation patterns in merlinmutant MSC and control MSC, we performed a western
blot using an ε-acetyl-Lysine antibody. Control MSC had
a higher number of and more intensely acetylated bands
than merlin-mutant MSC (Fig. 1a and Supplementary Fig.
S1). Because the merlin-mutant MSC presented fewer
bands, we asked whether SIRT2, the target of AGK2 had
altered expression levels. Indeed we found that merlinmutant MSC expressed SIRT2 at higher levels than control
MSC (Fig. 1b). The acetyl-lysine blot differed greatly
around the 50 kDa molecular weight marker. Because
SIRT2 is a recognized acetyl-α-tubulin deacetylase, we
investigated if any of those bands were α-tubulin. Merlinmutant MSC have highly deacetylated tubulin levels

SIRT2 Inhibition Selectively Reduces MerlinMutant MSC Viability in a Dose-Dependent
Manner
To evaluate selectivity of SIRT2 inhibition for
merlin-mutant MSC viability, we conducted a dose
response study of AGK2 using CellTiter-Fluor assay.
We found that a 24 hour exposure to AGK2 decreased
merlin-mutant MSC viability in a dose-dependent manner
with an IC50= 9.0 µM (Fig. 2a). In contrast, AGK2 did
not decrease control MSC viability as effectively as for
merlin-mutant cells (Fig. 2b). At 10 µM AGK2, merlinmutant cells retained 45.8 ± 0.7 % viability compared to
control MSC that retained 70.9 ± 1.8 % viability.
Although AGK2 is a highly selective SIRT2
inhibitor, it does minimally inhibit SIRT1 and SIRT3 at
ten times the SIRT2 IC50 level when tested in vitro [15].
To corroborate that SIRT2 was specifically inhibited by
AGK2 and associated with loss of merlin-mutant MSC
viability, we tested the effect of an alternative SIRT2

Progression or DNA Synthesis

propidium iodine (PI) labeled cells. We found that AGK2
did not significantly alter the distribution of diploid cells
in the cell cycle, although there was a tendency to slightly
increase the percentage of cells in the G2/M phase (Fig.
3e). To further analyze the effect of AGK2 on cell cycle
progression, we performed a BrdU/7-AAD assay. There
was no significant change in the distribution of treated
and untreated cell populations during the cell cycle after
24 hours (Fig. 3f). These results suggest that SIRT2
inhibition decreased merlin-mutant MSC proliferation
by mechanisms independent of interfering with cell cycle
progression.

We next assessed the ability of AGK2 to decrease
cell viability for longer incubation times. We treated
merlin-mutant MSC with vehicle or inhibitor and assessed
the cell number by crystal violet staining at 24, 48 and
72 hours. We found that at 72 hours AGK2 significantly
reduced the number of merlin-mutant MSC compared
to vehicle control (Fig. 3a). We also measured EdU
incorporation in AGK2-treated merlin-mutant MSC and
found that it did not decrease DNA synthesis compared to
vehicle treated controls (Fig. 3b).
To determine if the decrease in cell number caused
by AGK2 was associated with inhibition of cell cycle
progression, we performed flow cytometry analysis of

To determine if SIRT2 inhibition reduced merlinmutant MSC viability by inducing apoptosis, we tested
caspase 3/7 activity following AGK2 treatment. We found
that AGK2 moderately increased caspase 3/7 activity at 10
µM compared to the positive control, staurosporine, that
increased caspase 3 and 7 activity to much higher levels in
a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 4a). To further analyze if
SIRT2 inhibition induced caspase independent apoptosis,
we studied the effect of AGK2 on merlin-mutant MSC
membrane asymmetry using the violet ratiometric flow
cytometry assay. We found AGK2 only moderately
increased apoptosis from 3.5 ± 1.2 % in merlin-mutant
MSC treated with DMSO to 6.1 ± 2.8 % when treated
with AGK2. This increase however was not statistically
significant (Fig. 4b,c). These results suggest that even
though AGK2 slightly induced apoptosis it is not the
main mechanism responsible for the decreased viability
of merlin-mutant MSC.
Next, we assessed whether SIRT2 inhibition
decreased merlin-mutant MSC viability by inducing cell
death through necrosis. We measured cytotoxicity with
a fluorescence plate format assay that uses a cyanine
dye impermeant to live cells that stains DNA from dead
cells and increases its fluorescence. We found that both,
AGK2 and AK1, significantly increased the number of
dead merlin-null MSC in dose-dependent manners (Fig.
5a,b). To further analyze the mechanism of cell death,
we measured the release of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH)
from cells with damaged membranes into the medium
with the CytoTox-ONE homogeneous membrane integrity
assay. We found that both SIRT2 inhibitors, AGK2 and
AK1 increased the levels of LDH released to the medium
in a dose dependent manner. This is typically associated
with cell necrosis (Fig. 5c,d). We also measured release
from cells of the necrosis marker high mobility group box
1 protein (HMGB1) by western blot [26]. We found that
AGK2 and AK1 induced release of significant amounts
of HMGB1 into the medium that corresponded with a
decrease in intracellular HMGB1 levels (Fig. 5e). To

find evidence for that mechanism of action in this study.
SIRT2 was reported to associate with mitotic structures
and to increase in abundance and phosphorylation during
mitosis. It has been reported to prevent chromosome
condensation and entry into M phase in response to
mitotic stress. Additionally, overexpression of catalytically
inactive SIRT2 increased the number of multinucleated
HeLa cells. However in the absence of stressors, SIRT2
activity was not required for cell cycle progression in
HeLa and HEK293 cells [31]. In Schwann cells, selective
inactivation of Sirt2 during early embryogenesis did not
reduce the number of Schwann cells produced during the
period of rapid cell proliferation that occurs at post-natal
days 1-5. This supports the conclusion that cell cycle
progression in Schwann cells is independent of SIRT2
activity [9] in agreement with our finding that SIRT2
inhibition did not decrease merlin-mutant MSC viability
by arresting cell cycle progression but rather by inducing
cell necrosis. There is evidence for a role of SIRT2 in
necrosis. Nie et al. reported that AGK2 treatment of PC12
cells decreased intracellular ATP levels and increased
necrosis without affecting autophagy [32]. Additionally,
tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) was shown to activate
necroptosis via deacetylation of receptor-interacting
protein 1 (RIP1) by receptor-interacting protein 3 (RIP3)
bound SIRT2 allowing the formation of a stable complex
in L929 and Jurkat T cells [14]. Due to the prominent
role of cytokines in SC development and repair others
have shown that while a low concentration of TNF-α
induced SC proliferation, a high concentration of TNF-α
induced SC growth arrest and apoptosis [33-35]. We have
not studied TNF-α in merlin-mutant Schwann cells and
additional studies are needed to identify the pathway by
which inhibition of SIRT2 activity leads to cell necrosis.

SIRT2 in Cancer

Similar to our findings in Schwannoma and
control Schwann cells, upregulation of SIRT2 mRNA
and protein levels has been reported in some cancer
cells such as primary acute myeloid leukemia blasts
compared to control hematopoietic progenitor cells from
healthy individuals [36]. In glioma cells, however, it has
been reported that several human glioma samples had
reduced SIRT2 mRNA compared to normal brain tissue
and that overexpression of SIRT2 decreased HTB14
glioma cells colony formation [18]. Notably, inhibition of
SIRT2 activity decreased C6 glioma cells viability [17].
Additionally, aged mice with inactivation of the Sirt2
gene by deletion of exons 5-8 developed different types
of tumors depending on their gender [19]. Treatment of
C6 glioma cells with 10 µM AGK2 for 24 hours caused
a 60% loss of viability due to both apoptosis and necrosis
[17]. Similarly, another SIRT2 inhibitor, compound AC93253 showed selectively decreasing viability in several
human cancer cell lines over their human primary cells

controls [21]. The panel included cell lines from prostate,
pancreas, cervical and lung cancer. AC-93253 was also
selectively cytotoxic to HeLa cells by inducing apoptosis
and necrosis. Discrepancies in the positive and negative
associations of SIRT2 with tumor development are likely
due to differences in cell type, developmental activation
patterns for SIRT2 and substrate preferences [9, 37]. For
instance histone H4 is a principal substrate for SIRT2 in
various cell types but not in oligodendrocytes [11, 38].

Although AGK2 and AK1 selectively inhibit
SIRT2, at higher concentrations they can also inhibit
SIRT1 and SIRT3 in vitro [15]. Therefore it is possible
that at the IC50 concentrations used in this study, the
compounds could have also slightly decreased SIRT1
and 3 activity. Interestingly, treatment of BCL6expressing Burkitt lymphoma cells and Burkitt

inhibitor, cambinol, produced a potent antitumor effect
[39]. Hence, there may be value to SIRT2 and SIRT1
combinatorial inhibition in schwannoma treatment.
A recent study showed that acetylation of K-RAS at
lysine104 attenuates its transforming activity in cancer
cells and both SIRT2 and HDAC6 deacetylate K-RAS
[12]. Moreover, α-tubulin acetylation and cortactin are
regulated by SIRT2 and HDAC6 [10, 40, 41]. Due to the
increasing interest of HDAC inhibitors in cancer, a new
pan-HDAC inhibitor AR42 was tested on merlin mutant
schwannoma and meningioma cells. Both in vitro and in
vivo treatment showed a selective anti-proliferative effect
on schwannoma and meningioma cells warranting further
clinical evaluation for NF2 related tumors [42-44]. AR42,
similar to other HDAC inhibitors also decreased Akt
phosphorylation, a pathway upregulated in many cancers
and NF2. Chen et al. have shown that AR42 targets
HDAC1 and HDAC6 by disrupting their HDAC-protein
phosphatase 1 (PP1) complexes, which leads to increased
PP1-Akt association, and facilitates PP1-mediated
dephosphorylation of Akt [45]. Therefore combinatorial
inhibition of SIRT2 and HDAC6 could be evaluated when
considering modulation of acetylation signaling for NF2
treatment.
We speculate that SIRT2 pharmacological inhibition
may have some therapeutic value for NF2-associated
schwannomas by promoting necrosis. However, additional
research is needed to understand the relationship between
merlin and SIRT2 in normal Schwann cells and the effect
of merlin inactivation on protein acetylation and cell
survival.

their corresponding secondary antibodies at 1:20,000.
Quantification of western blots was done by densitometry
using NIH ImageJ software.

Rate of DNA synthesis was evaluated at 24 hours
with the Click-iT EdU Microplate Assay (Invitrogen/
Life Technologies) as previously described [23]. Oregon
green-488 and DAPI fluorescence was measured with a
Synergy H1 hybrid plate reader.

Cell Cycle Analysis
The cell cycle was analyzed by flow cytometry
with propidium iodine (PI) staining and BrdU/7AAD. PI
staining was performed on ethanol fixed cells using PI/
RNase solution from Beckton-Dickinson and studied on
a BD Canto-II flow cytometer. Histograms were analyzed
with ModFit LT software (Verity Software House,
Topsham, ME). For each sample, 10,000 events were
collected and the diploid population was distributed across
G0/G1, S and G2/M phases.
The BrdU/7AAD assay kit was purchased from
Beckton-Dickinson. Cells were seeded in 6-well plates
and treated overnight with inhibitor/vehicle. On the
next day, 10 µM BrdU was added to the cultures for 3
hours, cells were harvested, fixed and analyzed following
manufacturer’s instruction. The BD Canto-II flow
cytometer with the BD FACSDiva™ 6.1.3 software was
use for acquisition and Kaluza 1.2 (Beckman Coulter)
software for data analysis.

Immunofluorescence
Control and merlin-mutant MSC were plated on
coated German glass coverslips (200 µg/ml PLL and
10 µg/ml Laminin) and immunostained as previously
described [24]. Images were acquired using a Zeiss
LSM710 Confocal microscope with 3 spectral detection
channels, 5 laser lines - 458, 488, 514,543 & 633 nm, FL
filter set 49 DAPI, EX G365, FL filter set 43 CY 3, FL
filter set 38 Endow GFP, all shift free, EC Plan-Neofluar
40x/1.3 DIC WD=0.21 M27 objective lens, with the
ZEN2009 software. Fluorescence signals were acquired
on separate channels with identical parameters for each
labeled protein from a single plane. Fluorescence intensity
of the green channel was done using Volocity software.
Pictures were processed with the ZEN2011 software in the
same manner.

Apoptosis Assays
For caspases dependent apoptosis the caspase
activity was assessed by the Apo-ONE homogeneous
Caspase-3/7 assay (Promega) following manufacturer’s
specifications. For caspases dependent and/or independent
apoptosis the membrane asymmetry was measured with
the Violet Ratiometric Membrane Asymmetry Probe/Dead
Cell Apoptosis Kit (Invitrogen/Life Technologies). Both
assay were previously described [23].

Cell Viability Assay
Viability of dose-response assays was assessed
with the CellTiter-Fluor cell viability assay (Promega)
following manufacturer’s specifications. Normal MSC
and merlin-mutant MSC were seeded at 5,000 cells/well
in 20 µl of phenol-red free growth medium in 384-well
plates (black with clear bottom, CellBIND-Corning) and
centrifuged 1 min at 500 rpm. Cultures were incubated at
37ºC, 7% CO2 until attachment (2.5–3.5 hours), then 5
µl of compound/vehicle solution was added to each well.
Plates were quick spun again and returned to the incubator
for 24 hours. Fluorescence was read with a Synergy H1
Hybrid plate reader (BioTek, Winooski, VT).

Cytotoxicity Assays
Cytotoxicity was assayed in a 384 well plate
format with 5,000 cells/well after 24 hours incubation
with the inhibitors/vehicle with the CellTox Green assay
(Promega), following the express, no-step addition at
seeding method described by the manufacturer. Cells
treated with 27 µg/ml digitonin were considered 100%
cytotoxicity control. Fluorescence (Ex= 510nm/Em= 532
nm) was measured on a Synergy H1 Hybrid plate reader.

Proliferation Assays
For the 72 hours cell proliferation study, cell
numbers were assessed with the Crystal Violet Assay as
previously described [46]. Equal number of merlin-mutant
MSC were seeded in 24-well plates and cell number was
evaluated at 0; 24; 48 and 72 hour time points. Absorbance
at 595 nm was measured with a µQuant plate reader
(BioTek).

Equal number of merlin-null MSC per well in
CellBIND 6-well plates were cultured overnight. On the
next day the medium was replaced with 2 ml treatment
medium containing SIRT2 inhibitors/vehicle in duplicate
wells and incubated for 6 hours at 37ºC, 7% CO2. Then
working on ice, media from duplicates were pooled and
transferred to cold 15 ml conical tubes, centrifuged for
5 min at 800g, 4 ºC. The supernatant (~4ml) was syringe
filtered with 0.45 µm filter (Fisher), transferred to cold 7 ml
9K MWCO Pierce concentrators (Thermo Scientific) and
centrifuged for 30 min at 4,000g, 4 ºC. From 120 to 150
µl of concentrated proteins were obtained and prepared for
SDS-PAGE. When media was removed from cultures, the
plates were washed once with ice cold PBS and cell were
lysed with the modified RIPA buffer mentioned above;
protein concentration was measured with the DC assay
(BioRad). Equal volume of concentrated proteins from
medium and 10 µg of protein of cell lysates were analyzed
by western blotting for HMGB1.
