BACKGROUND. Patients with recurrent or metastatic HNC have a poor response
and survival with currently available chemotherapy agents. Thus, new agents are
needed. The authors report the results of a phase II trial of irinotecan and cisplatin in patients with metastatic or recurrent HNC.
METHODS. Patients were treated with irinotecan 65 mg/m2 IV over 90 minutes
and cisplatin 30 mg/m2 were administered intravenously weekly for four weeks,
followed by a two week rest. However, after 17 patients were treated with weekly
irinotecan at a dose of 65 mg/m2, toxicity analysis demonstrated the poor tolerance of that dose in this patient population. Thus, the protocol was amended,
and irinotecan was dose reduced to a starting dose of 50 mg/m2. Twenty-three
additional patients were treated with this dose.

pproximately 40,000 new cases of squamous cell carcinoma of
the head and neck (HNC) are diagnosed each year in the United
States. Most patients present with locally advanced but nonmetastatic disease. The increased use of concurrent chemoradiotherapy
has resulted in marked improvement in local/regional control and
survival. For patients who experience disease recurrence, a few may
be cured with salvage surgery or reirradiation. For the patients for
whom local therapy is not considered feasible, systemic therapy is
the standard treatment option. Even with treatment, their prognosis
is poor, and the median survival is less than 1 year.1
Numerous single agents have demonstrated activity in the recurrent or metastatic setting with response rates ranging from 15% to
35%. However, responses usually are ot duration (2–4 months). The
use of combination regimens results in improved response rates but
no significant improvement in overall survival compared with single

agents.2–5 New, active agents or combinations of
agents that may impact on survival must be identified
for the treatment of recurrent or metastatic disease.
Investigators at Vanderbilt University undertook
a Phase II trial to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of irinotecan in patients with recurrent, refractory,
or metastatic HNC. In a chemonaive patient population, the response rate to single agent irinotecan was
20% at a dose of 125 mg/m2 given weekly for 4
weeks followed by a 2-week rest. However, this regimen proved toxic, and the dose subsequently was
reduced to 75 mg/m2 irinotecan given on Days 1 and
8 of a 21-day cycle. The response rate was 13% using
this revised dose and schedule.6,7
Cisplatin remains one of the most active agents
for the treatment of HNC, and it is used in the primary treatment of locally advanced tumors as well as
in the metastatic or recurrent setting. In vitro and
xenograft studies demonstrate a synergistic anticancer effect of cisplatin and irinotecan, possibly related
to the down-regulation of topoisomerase I activity by
cisplatin. The combination of cisplatin and irinotecan has been evaluated extensively in other tumor
types using several differing doses and schedules and
has proven to be an active combination.8–13 The chosen dose and schedule of cisplatin in combination
with irinotecan were based on Phase I data from
Saltz et al. and from several Phase II studies of nonsmall cell lung cancer that confirmed the tolerability
of cisplatin 30 mg/m2 and irinotecan 65 mg/m2 on a
weekly schedule for 4 of 6 weeks for each treatment
cycle.11,14,15 On the basis of the promising preclinical
and clinical data, we designed a Phase II trial to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of irinotecan in
combination with cisplatin.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patient Eligibility and Baseline Assessment
Patients were aged 18 years and had histologically
proven HNC that was considered incurable with surgery or radiation therapy. Measurable disease was
required, and patients whos measurable disease was
within the prior radiation port must have had a biopsyproven recurrence at least 8 weeks after the completion of radiotherapy. Patients were excluded if they
had received prior chemotherapy for metastatic or
recurrent disease. Patients who received chemotherapy as part of primary combined-modality therapy at
least 6 months before study entry were considered eligible. Additional inclusion criteria were as follows: an
Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance
status from 0 to 2, adequate hematologic function
(granulocytes 1500/mm3 and platelets 100,000/
mm3), adequate hepatic function (aspartate amino-

187

transferase <3 times the upper limit of normal, serum
bilirubin <1.5 mg/dL), adequate renal function (serum creatinine <2 mg/dL or a creatinine clearance of
50 mL/minute). All patients provided written
informed consent for this study, which was approved
by the Institutional Review Board of the Vanderbilt
University School of Medicine.
Pretreatment evaluations included history and
physical examination, tumor measurements, chest xray, and routine blood work. Scans or x-rays to document measurable or evaluable disease were completed within 4 weeks before treatment. All chemistry
evaluations were completed within 2 weeks before
treatment, whereas complete blood counts with differential and platelet counts as well as potassium,
blood urea nitrogen, and creatinine levels were determined within 24 hours of treatment.
Patients received irinotecan 65 mg/m2 intravenously 90 minutes and cisplatin 30 mg/m2 administered intravenously weekly for 4 weeks followed by a
2-week rest. Patients were treated for a maximum of 6
cycles. Patients received standard antiemetic agents
for premedication of cisplatin, including dexamethasone plus a 5-hydroxytryptamine 3 receptor antagonist. Routine use of colony-stimulating factor (CSF)
(granulocte-CSF or granulocyte–macrophage-CSF)
was not recommended. Patients were instructed to
take loperamide at the earliest signs of diarrhea and/
or abdominal cramping that occurred >8 hours after
they received irinotecan. Atropine was used for the
first signs of cholinergic syndrome that occurred during or within 1 hour after patients received irinotecan.
Toxicities were graded according to the National
Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria (version
2.0). Dose modifications were made for grade 3 and 4
toxicities. Patients received a 1-dose-level reduction
to irinotecan 50 mg/m2 and cisplatin 20 mg/m2 given
on the same schedule if the absolute neutrophil count
was <1000/mm3 and the platelet count was <75,000/
mm3 within 24 hours of treatment. Treatment was
held for grade 3 or 4 diarrhea, nausea, or vomiting
that occurred despite appropriate supportive medications. Treatment was resumed when the toxicity
resolved to a grade 1 but was restarted at a 1-doselevel reduction. Patients were removed from study for
toxicity that did not resolve to grade 1 within 3
weeks, for toxicity that required >2 dose reductions,
and for >2 missed treatments in a single cycle.
Tumor measurements were obtained every 3
months for the first 2 years and every 6 months
thereafter. A complete response was defined as the
complete disappearance of all clinically detectable,
malignant disease for at least 4 consecutive weeks. A
partial response was defined as a decrease 50% in

188

the tumor area or a decrease of 50% in the sum of
the products of the greatest perpendicular dimensions of multiple lesions without an increase >25%
in the size of any area of known malignant disease
and without the appearance of new areas of malignant disease. Stable disease was defined as no significant change in measurable disease for at least 4
weeks, as defined by a decrease <50% in tumor area
or an increase of malignant disease <25% at any site
without the development of new sites of disease.
New lesions or an increase >25% in tumor volume
indicated disease progression. For lesions that measured <2 cm2, progression was defined as the appearance of new malignant lesions or an increase 50%
in the area of malignant disease.

Statistical Considerations
This trial was a single-institution, open-labeled, singlearm, Phase II investigation. A 2-stage accrual design, as described by Simon was used.16 If there was
evidence that the true underlying overall response
rate (complete and partial responses) was 30%,
then consideration would be given for further testing
of irinotecan and cisplatin. Planned accrual of this
first stage was 24 assessable patients. An early stopping rule was used so that, if <5 responses were
observed in the first 24 patients, then the trial would
be terminated with the conclusion that there was little evidence to suggest that the overall response rate
would reach 30%. However, if 5 responses were
observed in the first 24 patients, then the study
would continue to accrue a total of 54 patients, and
the combination would be considered interesting if
at least 13 of 54 patients demonstrated a response.
This dosing provided an 80% statistical power to
detect a difference of 15% with a significance level of
<.05 (Type 1 error). The trial was to accrue a maximum of 54 patients within a period of no >4 years.
The primary endpoint was the response rate.
Onset of response was defined as the time from the
date of initial treatment until the first objective documentation of disease progression. Duration of
response was defined as the time from the first
objective documentation of response to the first
objective documentation of disease progression. The
time to tumor progression was defined as time from
the date of initial treatment to the first objective documentation of disease progression. Response rates
were reported with the 2-sided 95% confidence intervals for the response rate on the basis of the multistage test method.
Survival and response analyses were performed
on all treated patients. Survival was estimated by
using the Kaplan-Meier method. In addition, for life-

time data analysis, the possible risk factors were
compared for survival with Kaplan-Meier estimates
and log-rank tests. A proportional hazards model was
used for adjusted tests of significance and estimates
of odds ratios.
However, after 17 patients were treated at the 65
mg/m2 irinotecan dose, toxicity analyses demonstrated the poor tolerability of that dose in this
patient population. Thus, the protocol was amended,
and the irinotecan dose was reduced to a starting
dose of 50 mg/m2. Because the original dose level
demonstrated a significant response rate, a decision
was made to enroll 23 patients at the second dose
level to assess efficacy and toxicity. If toxicity was
reduced substantially and efficacy was maintained,
then accrual would continue to 54 patients for the
second dose level.

RESULTS
Forty patients were enrolled on the study between
February 2002 and April 2006, including 17 patients
at the first dose level and 23 patients at the second
dose level. Most patients were men, and the median
age was 58 years. The patient characteristics are
listed in Table 1. Forty patients were evaluable for
toxicity, and 32 patients were evaluable for response.
The reasons that patients were not evaluable for
response included 7 patients who did not receive at
least 1 full cycle of therapy apiece and 1 patient who
had incomplete records. In total, 40 chemotherapy
cycles were delivered, including 17 cycles at a starting dose of irinotecan 65 mg/m2 and 23 cycles at a
starting dose of irinotecan 50 mg/m2. Each patient
received an average of 2.15 cycles of therapy.

Toxicity
Common grade 3 and 4 toxicities are listed in Table
2. Six of 17 patients experienced grade 3 or 4 neutropenia for a rate of 35%. Eight of 17 patients (47%)
who were treated at this dose experienced grade 3 or
4 gastrointestinal toxicity, which manifested as nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea. Overall, 12 of 17 patients
(71%) who received irinotecan 65 mg/m2 experienced
clinically significant grade 3 or 4 toxicity. Twelve
patients required dose reductions.
Twenty-three patients were enrolled at the second
dose level. Although toxicity was diminished, it
remained substantial. Five of 23 patients (22%)
demonstrated grade 3 or 4 neutropenia, and 4 of 23
patients (17%) demonstrated grade 3 or 4 gastrointestinal toxicity. Seven patients required a dose reduction.
Response
Six of 17 patients (35%) who received irinotecan 65
mg/m2 demonstrated a partial response to treatment.
Five of 23 patients (22%) who received irinotecan 50
mg/m2 demonstrated a partial response to treatment.
No complete responses were noted in either group.
Eight of 11 patients who responded to therapy had
received prior chemotherapy as part of first-line,
curative treatment. Six of 32 patients demonstrated
stable disease (18%) as their best response. Fifteen
patients demonstrated progressive disease as their
best response. For all patients on study, the average
progression-free survival was 2.3 months, and the
median progression-free survival was 1.6 months.
The average overall survival was 7.2 months, and the
median overall survival was 6.3 months. Five patients
remain alive with a range of survival from 378 days
to 1228 days. Four of those patients received irinote-

can 50 mg/m2, and 1 patient received irinotecan 65
mg/m2. The 1- and 2-year survival rates were 50%
and 37%, respectively (see Figs. 1, 2). No pretreatment or treatment characteristics were correlated
significantly with response or survival. Given the
substantial toxicity of the treatment regimen and the
modest efficacy at the lower dose level, the study
was closed.

DISCUSSION
In this article, we report the results from a Phase II
trial that explored the efficacy and toxicity of irinote-

can and cisplatin in patients with metastatic and
recurrent HNC. The combination resulted in an overall response rate of 35% at the 65 mg/m2 irinotecan
dose level and 22% at the 50 mg/m2 irinotecan dose
level. The median survival and progression-free survival for this combination of agents was not strikingly different from historic controls. However, the
combination was associated with significant hematologic and gastrointestinal toxicity. Greater than 70%
of patients who were treated at the original dose
level experienced grade 3 and 4 toxicity. At the 50
mg/m2 irinotecan dose level, the toxicity was diminished but remained substantial. Although the combination had reasonable efficacy, the high levels of
toxicity argue against its routine use as first-line therapy for metastatic or recurrent HNC. However, at the
time this report was written, 5 patients remained
alive, and 2 of those patients had survived for
approximately 3 years. Whether this is an effect of
the study regimen, subsequent therapy, or underlying
disease biology is unknown.
In our previous trial, we demonstrated that single-agent irinotecan was effective in both chemonaive and previously treated HNC.17 However, the
toxicity is significant in the head and neck population whether it is used as a single-agent or combined
with another cytotoxic chemotherapy. The reason for
this is unclear, because irinotecan was tolerated well
in a multiagent regimen for recurrent/metastatic colon cancer and because a Phase I trial by Saltz et al.
demonstrated good tolerability of this regimen. One
possible explanation may be that patients with HNC
cancers frequently have a history of tobacco and
alcohol use and have multiple comorbidities that
may contribute to decreased tolerance of therapy in
general. Moreover, most patients with recurrent or
metastatic disease have received aggressive therapy
for primary disease and may have diminished
reserve. Although the Phase I study by Saltz et al.
and the Phase II study by Jagasia et al. enrolled
patients with the equivalent of a performance status
of 2, toxicities were not evaluated in relation to performance status. Our study also did not perform this
analysis. In hindsight, such an analysis may have
been better for identifying a subgroup of patients
with improved tolerance of this regimen. Moreover,
the current study was carried out at both the Vanderbilt Ingram Cancer Center and in community oncology clinics in the Vanderbilt Ingram Associated
Network. One observation from this trial may be
that, in the HNC population, this regimen requires
very close clinical monitoring, early recognition of
toxicities and toxicity syndromes, and aggressive
therapeutic intervention. Therefore, the regimen may

be impractical in a community setting. It also may
be hypothesized that the inferior tolerability of this
regimen, compared with the same regimen in other
cancer populations, stems from the production of
proinflammatory cytokines by the HNC tumors.
Overexpression of nuclear factor (NF)-jB leads to
cytokine expression on HNC tumors.18,19 Proinflammatory cytokines are elevated in the blood of
patients with HNC and may serve as a biomarker for
recurrence and prognosis.20 Cytokines are associated
with multiple symptoms of advanced cancer and its
treatment, perhaps leading to a lower threshold for
develop toxicities in an already cytokine-enriched
milleau.21 In addition, cytokines may effect drug metabolism. Cytokines like interleukin-6, tumor necrosis
factor, interleukin-1, and interferon lead to a
decrease in liver cytochrome P450 in tumor-bearing
animals. In addition, an inverse correlation between
inflammation and metabolism has been demonstrated in metabolism and cytochrome P3A4 activity
in cancer patients.22 Thus, drug exposure may differ
between cancer patient populations.
The current study has several limitations. First,
the dose was changed after 17 patients were enrolled
because of excessive toxicity. Second, the study was
closed after an additional 23 patients were enrolled
on the adjusted dose schedule. Thus, the current
study is subject to both Type 1 error and Type 2
error. Several factors contributed to the decision to
close the trial early, including excessive toxicity at
the adjusted dose and slowing accrual because of interest in less toxic, targeted agents. Despite the limitations, the results do confirm the activity of the
regimen, although the toxicity makes it unsuitable
for the general head and neck population.
Further development of irinotecan in this population will require 1 of 2 things: identification of
patients who are likely to have significant toxicity or
the identification of less toxic combinations. The
uridine diphosphate-glucuronosyltransferase 1A1
(UGT1A1) polymorphism in irinotecan metabolism
has been associated with drug-related toxicity. Laboratory testing for high-risk polymorphisms currently
is available and may allow clinicians to prospectively
determine which patients will have the best risk/benefit ratio with the use of this drug either alone or in
combination with other agents.23–25 In addition, the
combination of irinotecan with targeted agents
remains an attractive combination because of the
relatively favorable toxicity profile of these agents.
Cetuximab, a recombinant human/mouse chimeric monoclonal antibody, is one of the most promising targeted agents for the treatment of advanced
HNC. Cetuximab is the first agent to demonstrate a

Irinotoecan and Cisplatin in HNSCC/Gilbert et al.

survival advantage for patients with refractory or
metastatic HNC.26 As a single agent, cetuximab
monotherapy has an objective response rate of 13%
and a median survival of 5.9 months in a platinum
refractory group of patients.27 Both preclinical and
clinical data suggest that the addition of cetuximab
to irinotecan can overcome cellular resistance to irinotecan. This resistance may be related in part to
the overexpression of NF-jB; in HNC.28 Clinically,
the combination of cetuximab and irinotecan
demonstrates encouraging results in colorectal cancer and should be evaluated in metastatic/refractory
HNC.28–31
In summary, the combination of cisplatin and
irinotecan has some efficacy in patients with recurrent or metastatic HNC. However, the high levels of
toxicity argue against its routine use as first-line therapy for metastatic or recurrent HNC. In the future,
trials of irinotecan in HNC should take away several
points from this investigation: 1) Appropriate patient
selection should be considered carefully, and 2) a
priori identification of patients at risk for toxicity secondary to UGT1A1 polymorphisms or use of irinotecan in combination with targeted agents may
provide for a better toxicity/benefit ratio.
