Abstract
Familial breast and ovarian cancers are often defective in homologous recombination (HR) due to mutations in the BRCA1 or BRCA2 genes. Cisplatin chemotherapy or poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors
were tested for these tumors in clinical trials. In a screen for novel drugs that selectively kill BRCA2-defective
cells, we identified 6-thioguanine (6TG), which induces DNA double-strand breaks (DSB) that are repaired by HR.
Furthermore, we show that 6TG is as efficient as a PARP inhibitor in selectively killing BRCA2-defective tumors
in a xenograft model. Spontaneous BRCA1-defective mammary tumors gain resistance to PARP inhibitors
through increased P-glycoprotein expression. Here, we show that 6TG efficiently kills such BRCA1-defective
PARP inhibitor–resistant tumors. We also show that 6TG could kill cells and tumors that have gained resistance
to PARP inhibitors or cisplatin through genetic reversion of the BRCA2 gene. Although HR is reactivated in PARP
inhibitor–resistant BRCA2-defective cells, it is not fully restored for the repair of 6TG-induced lesions. This is
likely to be due to several recombinogenic lesions being formed after 6TG. We show that BRCA2 is also required
for survival from mismatch repair–independent lesions formed by 6TG, which do not include DSBs. This
suggests that HR is involved in the repair of 6TG-induced DSBs as well as mismatch repair–independent
6TG-induced DNA lesion. Altogether, our data show that 6TG efficiently kills BRCA2-defective tumors and suggest that 6TG may be effective in the treatment of advanced tumors that have developed resistance to PARP
inhibitors or platinum-based chemotherapy. Cancer Res; 70(15); 6268–76. ©2010 AACR.

Introduction
Breast cancer is the most common cancer in women in
the Western world today, and in the United Kingdom,
breast cancer incidence rates have increased by more than
50% over the last 25 years. Familial mutations in the breast
cancer susceptibility genes BRCA1 or BRCA2 are associated
with an increased risk of several cancers, particularly

breast, ovarian, and prostate cancer (1). The proteins encoded by these genes play important roles in homologous recombination (HR) repair (2–4) and it is likely that their tumor
suppressor function is explained by their role in reducing mutation rates (5). This hypothesis is also supported by the observation that proteins with related functions have also been
linked with a predisposition to developing breast cancer, i.e.,
CHEK2 (6), ATM (7), PALB2 (FANCN; refs. 8–10), and BRIP1
(BACH1; ref. 11).
HR-defective cells are characterized by hypersensitivity to
cross-linking agents, which is thought to be related to the
role of HR in bypassing inter-strand cross-links during DNA
replication (12). HR-defective cells are also hypersensitive to
poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors (13, 14).
This involves PARP1 having a role in DNA single-strand
break repair (15), which results in the suppression of HR
(16). PARP inhibitors might increase the amount of single-strand breaks, which collapse into DNA double-strand
breaks (DSB) at replication forks, requiring HR for repair
(17). In the absence of HR, these DSBs are not repaired,
resulting in HR-defective cells such as BRCA1- and
BRCA2-mutated cancers, which are therefore hypersensitive to PARP inhibitors (13). In the clinic, PARP inhibitors
efficiently killed BRCA1- and BRCA2-defective tumors in a
phase I/II clinical trial (18). However, acquired resistance
to PARP inhibitor is a problem and may involve either

additional mutations in the BRCA1 or BRCA2 genes that
result in restoration of the COOH-terminal part of the
proteins (19–21) or upregulation of Abcb1a/b genes encoding P-glycoprotein efflux pumps (22). Although the
extent of resistance that can be acquired by these mechanisms is unclear in humans, it suggests that the discovery of agents that may overcome such resistance
mechanisms merit further investigation.

Materials and Methods
Chemicals
All chemicals were obtained from Sigma unless stated
otherwise, AG014699 was provided by Pfizer GRD, and
KU0058948 and olaparib were from KuDOS Pharmaceuticals.
AG014699 and KU0058948 compounds were dissolved at
10 mmol/L in 100% dry DMSO and stored at −20°C, it was
diluted in culture medium to give the final desired drug concentration in 1% DMSO with control cultures exposed to 1%
DMSO alone. The National Cancer Institute (NCI) diversity
and mechanistic set were obtained from NCI (Bethesda,
MA) and stocks were maintained in 96-well plates in DMSO
[stock concentration 1 mmol/L (mechanistic set) and
10 mmol/L (diversity set)].
Cell culture and isolation of PARP inhibitor–resistant
cells. HCT116 and HCT116+Chr3 were obtained from
Dr. Bert Vogelstein, U2OS cell line was obtained from American Type Culture Collection, capan-1, and resistant capan-1
clones from Dr. Toshiyasu Taniguchi, AA8, irs1SF, and
CXR3 cells were from Dr. Larry Thompson, whereas V-C8
and V-C8B2 cells were previously isolated (4). All cells
were grown in DMEM with 10% fetal bovine serum and
penicillin/streptomycin at 37°C under an atmosphere
containing 5% CO2.
shRNA depletion of BRCA2
Depletion of BRCA2 expression in U2OS or HCT116 cells
was obtained from the stably integrated regulatable
expression of BRCA2 short hairpin (shRNA) using the
BLOCK-iT Inducible H1 RNAi Entry Vector Kit from Invitrogen, according to the manufacturers protocol (Invitrogen, Sweden). The target sequence introduced was AAC
AAC AAU UAC GAA CCA AAC UU (23).
Western blot
Proteins from cell lysates were separated and detected
using Western blotting as previously described (24). The
primary antibody was an anti-rabbit BRCA2 antibody
(Santa Cruz Biotechnology) diluted 1:500 in blocking
solution.
Screening procedure
U2OS BRCA2 shRNA cells were grown in the presence or
absence of 2 μg/mL of doxycyclin for 2 days, plated in 96-well
plates (2,000 cells/well) in the presence or absence of doxycyclin, and the next day, treated with test compounds (at a
concentration 10 μmol/L) from the NCI library. After
72 hours, WST-1 cell proliferation reagent was used to deter-

www.aacrjournals.org

mine the cells viability as described earlier (25). Compounds
from the library that selectively suppressed the growth of
BRCA2-defective cells, but had only modest effects on
BRCA2-proficient cells were selected.
Colony formation assay
Cells were plated into six-well plates at a density of
200 cells/well. The next day, the cells were treated with selected compounds at a range of concentrations, for different time periods (from 3 hours up to 6 days). After 1 week
[for V-C8 and V-C8+B2 cells and PARP inhibitor–resistant
(PIR) clones] or 2 weeks (for U2OS cells), when colonies
could be observed, the colonies were fixed and stained with
methylene blue in methanol (4 g/L). Colonies consisting of
more than 30 cells were subsequently counted. In addition, exponentially growing V-C8, V-C8+B2, and PIR clones 1C and 2B
were exposed to varying concentrations of AG014699 for
24 hours or 6-thioguanine (6TG) for 48 hours prior to seeding
in 90 mm dishes in drug-free medium for colony formation.
Colonies were fixed and stained with crystal violet 10 to 14
days later and counted on an automatic colony counter (Oxford
Optronix).
Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis
Cells were treated with 6TG, collected by trypsinization,
resuspended in 1% InCert-agarose (in 37°C PBS) to a final
concentration of 1.5 million cells/100 μL and agarose plugs
were separated by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis as previously described (26).
Immunofluorescence
Cells were grown on coverslips, treated, fixed, immunostained, and analyzed as previously described (24). The primary antibodies used were mouse monoclonal anti-γH2AX
at a dilution of 1:1,000 and rabbit polyclonal anti-Rad51 (H-92;
Santa Cruz Biotechnology) at a dilution of 1:1,000.
Propidium iodide staining and fluorescence-activated
cell sorting analysis
Cells (1 × 106) were treated (or not treated) with compounds (such as B9 or 6TG), collected by trypsinization,
and fixed in ice-cold 70% ethanol overnight at −20°C. The
cells were then rehydrated in PBS and stained with 50 μg/mL
of propidium iodide and 100 μg/mL of RNase A in PBS for
30 minutes at room temperature. Samples were further analyzed on a BD Biosciences FACScan. The data was analyzed
with WinMDI software version 2.8.
In vivo experiments
Exponentially growing VC8 or VC8-B2 cells (1 × 107 )
were injected i.m. into the thigh of each CD1 nude
(Charles River) mouse in 50 μL of PBS and handled and analyzed as previously described (13). Tumor growth was assessed using the ratio of the diameter of the right (tumor
bearing) to the left (normal) thighs. When thigh ratio reached
between 1.3 and 1.5, mice were divided into groups for the following treatments: AG014699 10 mg/kg (made up on day of
use at 1 mg/mL in water) or 6TG 1.5 mg/kg (made up on

Generation of mammary tumors
Brca1 Δ5-13/Δ5-13 ;p53 Δ2-10/Δ2-10 mammary tumors were
generated in K14cre;Brca1F5-13/F5-13;p53F2-10/F2-10 mice and
genotyped as described (27). Orthotopic transplantations
of tumor fragments into syngeneic animals and caliper
measurements of mammary tumors have been previously
reported (22).

Results
BRCA2-defective cells are hypersensitive to 6TG
Individuals with inherited mutations in either BRCA1 or
BRCA2 alleles have a high risk of developing breast cancer
(1, 28). Here, we wanted to identify novel compounds to selectively kill BRCA2-defective cells. We developed a shRNA
system to deplete the BRCA2 protein upon removal of doxycycline in U2OS sarcoma cells, and we assayed the mechanistic
and diversity set compound libraries from the NCI for compounds that selectively killed BRCA2-depleted cells. Mercury(2-amino-1, 9-dihydro-6H-purine-6-thionato-N7,S6)hexyl (B9)
was identified in the screen as the most efficient compound
to selectively kill BRCA2-depleted U2OS cells (Supplementary
Fig. S1). We also found that this compound selectively killed
BRCA2-defective V-C8 cells as compared with V-C8+B2, the
isogenic cell line expressing BRCA2WT protein (V-C8+B2;
ref. 4; Supplementary Fig. S1). The reason for the selective killing of BRCA2-defective cells is likely to be explained by the role
of BRCA2 in HR because cells defective in the RAD51 paralo-

gue XRCC3 were similarly sensitive to the B9 compound
(Supplementary Fig. S1).
Structural analysis of the B9 compound revealed a
strong resemblance to 6TG, which is a well-established
chemotherapy used to treat hematologic malignancies in
children and adults (29). We therefore decided to test
the sensitivity of BRCA2-deficient cells to 6TG and found
that survival was significantly lower than that of BRCA2expressing cells (Fig. 1A). Furthermore, we found that the
BRCA2 protein is required to prevent apoptosis induced by
6TG, measured by sub-G1 population (Fig. 1B) and the terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase–mediated dUTP nick end
labeling assay (Fig. 1C).
6TG selectively kills BRCA2-defective tumors
To test the hypothesis that 6TG is useful for selective treatment of BRCA2-deficient tumors, we treated mice bearing xenografts derived from BRCA2-deficient V-C8 and wild-type
BRCA2-complemented V-C8+B2 cells. Consistent with the
hypothesis, we found that neither the PARP inhibitor,
AG014699, nor 6TG had any effect on the outgrowth of the
BRCA2-proficient tumors (Fig. 1D); in contrast, all mice with
BRCA2-defective tumors responded to both 6TG and the
PARP inhibitor equally, with significant growth delay and
three of five complete tumor regressions in both groups. These
results suggest that 6TG is as effective as the PARP inhibitor,
AG014699, in selectively killing BRCA2-defective tumors. However, it should be noted that 6TG at 1.5 mg/kg caused a greater
loss of body weight than AG014699 (Supplementary Table S1)
and was not tolerated at a higher dose of 3 mg/kg (data
not shown).

6-Thioguanine Selectively Kills BRCA2-Defective Tumors

6TG-induced DNA DSBs are repaired by HR
6TG is an antimetabolite of purine metabolism and is incorporated into the DNA of mammalian cells in place of guanine during DNA replication (29). The incorporated 6TG (∼1
in 104 bases) is then methylated in situ to 6-meTG by endogenous S-adenosylmethionine and becomes a substrate for
mismatch repair in the second replication round to mediate
its toxicity (30–33). As a measure of formation of DSBs in
DNA, we looked at the nuclear levels of γH2AX in cells treated with 6TG and we found that γH2AX foci formed with
similar frequency in both BRCA2-deficient and -proficient
cells (Fig. 2A and B). This similarity suggests that the hypersensitivity of BRCA2-deficient cells to 6TG is due to an inability to repair DNA damage rather than a difference in
the amount of damage introduced. We also found that
γH2AX foci colocalized with RAD51 foci after 6TG treatment
in BRCA2-proficient cells (Fig. 2C and D, right panels), suggesting that the RAD51 protein is recruited to DSBs to repair

the lesion by HR. In contrast, RAD51 foci did not form at
6TG-induced γH2AX foci in BRCA2-defective V-C8 cells, suggesting that DSB repair is deficient in these cells (Fig. 2C and
D, left panels). Using pulsed-field gel electrophoresis, we
found that BRCA2-defective V-C8 cells were unable to repair
6TG-induced DSBs compared with BRCA2-expressing cells
(Supplementary Fig. S2). To further investigate the role of
HR in the 6TG-induced DNA damage, we looked at the survival of cells defective in the RAD51 paralogue, XRCC3
(irs1SF), and we found that these cells were considerably
more sensitive to 6TG than AA8 control cells (Fig. 2E). Altogether, these findings suggest that the sensitivity of BRCA2defective cells to 6TG was due to their inability to perform
HR repair. HR is important in repairing DNA damage caused
by a wide range of mono- or bifunctional alkylating anticancer agents, for example, the commonly used drugs, cisplatin
and mitomycin C (34). To our knowledge, these results with
6TG represent the first time HR has been implicated in the

encoding the mouse drug efflux transporter P-glycoprotein
explains resistance to the PARP inhibitor olaparib in
BRCA1;p53-defective mammary tumors (22). Here, we
wanted to determine whether 6TG could target such PIR
tumors. To test this, Brca1Δ5-13/Δ5-13;p53Δ2-10/Δ2-10 mammary tumors derived from K14cre;Brca1F5-13/F5-13;p53F2-10/F2-10
mice were grown out and treated with olaparib as previously described (22). Small tumor fragments of an olaparibresistant tumor (T6-28) with 80-fold increased expression
of the Abcb1b gene were transplanted orthotopically into
syngeneic wild-type female mice. The animals were
then treated with 6TG when the tumor volume reached
∼200 mm3. Interestingly, we found that tumors responded
to 6TG (Fig. 3). This shows that spontaneous BRCA1;p53defective mammary tumors are sensitive to 6TG, and importantly, that PIR tumors in which resistance is caused
by increased P-glycoprotein–mediated drug efflux remain

sensitive to 6TG. After the 10-day treatment with 6TG, tumors eventually grew back. However, such tumors were
still responding to a second line treatment with 6TG, indicating that the tumors did not easily obtain resistance
to 6TG.
BRCA2-defective cells and tumors that gain resistance
to PARP inhibitors through genetic reversion respond
to 6TG treatment
The mechanisms of acquired resistance to PARP inhibitors
could also evolve through genetic reversion in BRCA2defective cancer cells (20, 21). In such cases, a mutation in
the BRCA2 gene results in which the COOH-terminal part
of the protein is retained and the protein is overall functional
in HR, despite missing a single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) binding domain (20, 21). To investigate this mechanism of resistance further, we used BRCA2-defective V-C8 clones selected
for resistance to a PARP inhibitor.8 All PIR V-C8 clones harbor the same mutation, restoring the correct reading frame
for BRCA2 and at the same time introducing a mutation
within a highly conserved region in exon 15. This mutation
affects a highly conserved arginine that was also identified
in a family with breast and ovarian cancers (37), and was described in mitomycin C–resistant V-C8 cells (38). Thus, the
reverted BRCA2 still has a defective ssDNA domain in the
COOH-terminal part of the protein, as described earlier (20,
21), which restored HR as indicated by the ability to form
RAD51 foci in response to PARP inhibitor treatment (Supplementary Fig. S3). We tested the sensitivity of PIR-resistant
clones 1C and 2B to the PARP inhibitor AG014699 and
found that both clones had lost their sensitivity to PARP
inhibitors (Fig. 4A).

We then tested the sensitivity of PIR V-C8 cells for crossresistance to cisplatin and 6TG. Parental V-C8 cells are
highly sensitive to both cisplatin and 6TG, compared with
the BRCA2-expressing V-C8+B2 cells (Fig. 4B and C). As
expected from previous studies (20, 21), PIR V-C8 clones
exhibited resistance to cisplatin (Fig. 4B). Surprisingly, we
found that PIR V-C8 cells had not fully reverted to resistance
to 6TG (Fig. 4C), suggesting that 6TG might still kill PIR
BRCA2-defective tumors that gained resistance through genetic reversion.
We confirmed that BRCA2 revertant cells, which have
acquired resistance to cisplatin, retain sensitivity to 6TG
by using BRCA2-defective human pancreatic cancer cell
line capan-1 and four different independent cisplatinresistant capan-1 clones (20). Clones 6 and 12 acquired resistance through an additional mutation in the BRCA2 gene
that corrected the frameshift caused by the 6174delT mutation in capan-1 cells, whereas clones 10 and 11 did not have
an additional BRCA2 mutation, lack BRCA2 protein expression, and are likely to have reverted to cisplatin resistance
through other unknown pathways (20). Interestingly, all four
cisplatin-resistant clones showed equal sensitivity to 6TG as
parental capan-1 cells (Supplementary Fig. S4), providing
additional evidence that PIR and cisplatin-resistant
BRCA2-defective cancer cells are sensitive to treatment
with 6TG.
Next, we wanted to test whether 6TG could also
retard the outgrowth of PIR BRCA2-defective tumors that
have gained resistance through genetic reversion. To test
this, we treated mice bearing xenografts derived from
PIR clone 2B with a 10-day treatment of AG014699
or 6TG and found that PIR clone 2B tumors only responded to the 6TG treatment and not to the PARP inhibitor (Fig. 4D; statistically significant in Mann-Whitney
test, P < 0.01).

Differential sensitivity to anticancer drugs in
genetically reverted BRCA2-defective cells
To gain further insights into the function of the restored
BRCA2 protein carrying a mutation in the ssDNA binding
domain, we further investigated the sensitivity of the PIR
clones to a range of cytotoxic agents (Supplementary Fig.
S5A–E and F). The PIR clones exhibited similar levels of resistance to temozolomide, camptothecin, and ionizing radiation as the V-C8+B2 cells compared with the more sensitive
V-C8 cells. Interestingly, the PIR clones were slightly more
resistant to doxorubicin than the V-C8+B2 cells, which were
in turn more resistant than the V-C8 cells (Supplementary
Fig. S5D). Surprisingly, the V-C8 and the PIR clones were less
sensitive to gemcitabine and paclitaxel than the V-C8+B2
cells (Supplementary Fig. S5E and F). These data suggest that
recombination-defective BRCA1 and BRCA2 tumors would
respond poorly to gemcitabine and paclitaxel treatments.

The retained sensitivity to 6TG and resistance to gemcitabine and paclitaxel in the PIR clones is likely to be explained
by the reverted BRCA2 gene which did not revert back to
wild-type, but retained a mutation in the ssDNA domain,
which may impair HR induced by these agents. This ssDNA
domain might be required for the BRCA2 response to 6TG
and might prevent the efficient repair of gemcitabine- and
paclitaxel-induced lesions.
6TG induces both mismatch repair–dependent and
–independent lesions that require HR repair
Next, we wanted to understand the mechanism for PIR
cells maintaining their sensitivity to 6TG. We analyzed
RAD51 foci and found that PIR V-C8 cells induced
RAD51 foci as efficiently as V-C8+B2 cells in response to
treatment with a PARP inhibitor, but not in response to
treatment with 6TG, suggesting that the BRCA2-reverted
protein is not fully proficient for 6TG-induced HR (Fig.
5A). We also investigated the translocation of the RAD51
protein into the chromatin fraction, as this may be associated with the efficiency of RAD51 loading on to DNA and
subsequent HR (39). We found that the RAD51 protein is
more efficiently recruited to DNA after 6TG in V-C8+B2
cells than in the 1C clone, and conversely, that the
RAD51 protein is more efficiently recruited to DNA in the
1C clone than V-C8+B2 following treatment with the PARP
inhibitor, KU0058948 (Supplementary Fig. S6). Next, we investigated the repair of 6TG-induced DNA lesions by
γH2AX foci formation and find that BRCA2 is required
for efficient repair (Fig. 5B). Interestingly, neither the 1C
or 2B clones fully repaired the 6TG-induced DNA damage,
suggesting that their lack of efficient HR repair is the reason for their 6TG sensitivity.
The reason for the differential response to 6TG and PARP
inhibitors might be related to the production of different recombinogenic lesions in DNA. To test this hypothesis, we
treated mismatch repair–defective HCT116 colorectal cancer
cells and the same cells with restored mismatch repair function (HCT116+Ch3; ref. 40) with 6TG, the PARP inhibitor
4-amino-1,8-naphthalimide (ANI) and cisplatin. We found
that only the cytotoxicity of 6TG was dependent on a functional mismatch repair pathway (Fig. 6A; Supplementary
Fig. S7). Furthermore, the level of recombinogenic DSBs, measured by γH2AX foci, were dependent on mismatch repair
after 6TG treatment, whereas the generation of these lesions
was unaffected by PARP inhibitor and cisplatin treatment in
these cell lines (Fig. 6B). Our data are in line with evidence
showing that toxic DSBs induced by 6TG are mismatch
repair–dependent (30), and it has previously been shown that
HR induced by O6-guanine methylating agents depends on
mismatch repair (41). This is also in line with our previous observation that 6TG-induced DSBs require HR for repair (Fig. 5B;
Supplementary Fig. S2).
There is a possibility that 6TG may produce another
mismatch repair–independent HR substrate, given that the
PIR V-C8 clones show an intermediate HR response to
6TG (Fig. 5). To test this, we shRNA-depleted BRCA2 in
HCT116 cells to test if the absence of 6TG-induced DSBs also

6-Thioguanine Selectively Kills BRCA2-Defective Tumors

abolished the requirements for HR survival. Surprisingly, we
find that mismatch repair–defective HCT116 still requires
BRCA2 for survival to 6TG, showing that 6TG also produces
a recombinogenic lesion that is independent of mismatch
repair (Fig. 6C).

Discussion
Here, we report that cells and/or tumors defective in the
HR genes BRCA1, BRCA2, or XRCC3 are hypersensitive to 6TG
and that, in the case of BRCA2, this could be reversed by the
introduction of a vector expressing the BRCA2 protein. We
show that 6TG induced RAD51 foci at 6TG-induced DSBs
and that the DSBs were less efficiently repaired in BRCA2defective cells, which correlates with increased toxicity in
HR-defective cells. This is, to our knowledge, the first time that
HR has been implicated in the repair of 6TG-induced DSBs.
Interestingly, the opposite result was previously reported:
that expression of BRCA1WT in BRCA1-mutated HCC1937
breast cancer cells increases sensitivity to 6TG (42). However,
this is unrelated to any role of BRCA1 in HR (42) and the
BRCA1 mutation in HCC1937 cells is unlikely to affect HR,
as RAD51 foci are efficiently induced by IR in these cells (43).
Although PARP inhibitors have been shown to efficiently
kill both BRCA1- and BRCA2-defective tumors, resistance to
therapy may develop within 18 to 77 weeks (18). Although the
exact mechanisms for PIR in patients remains unknown, this
might involve the expression of P-glycoprotein efflux pumps
as in mammary mice tumors (22) or through genetic reversion of either BRCA1 or BRCA2 (19–21). Here, we show that
6TG efficiently kills PIR BRCA1-defective mammary tumors
(Fig. 3), which is likely explained by 6TG not being a substrate for P-glycoprotein (44). Furthermore, we show that genetically reverted BRCA2-defective cells and tumors respond
to 6TG. Altogether, these findings suggest that 6TG might also be efficient in killing advanced and drug-resistant BRCA1or BRCA2-defective tumors.
Here, we find that PIR V-C8 clones do not completely revert back to a functional HR phenotype in response to 6TG
(Fig. 5), which likely explains their 6TG sensitivity. This sug-

gests that there may be several lesions formed following 6TG
treatment that trigger HR. For instance, we recently showed
that HR is involved in restart at stalled replication forks, which
does not involve DSB repair (45, 46). Thus, there is a possibility
that 6TG might cause replication lesions other than mismatch
repair–dependent DSBs that trigger HR. In support for this
notion, we find that mismatch repair–defective HCT116 cells
are sensitized to 6TG by the depletion of BRCA2 in spite of
already being defective in mismatch repair. This shows that
both mismatch repair–dependent and –independent HR
lesions are formed by 6TG. Also, this would explain the intermediate response in PIR V-C8 clones to 6TG.
In conclusion, we show that 6TG could be efficiently used
to selectively kill BRCA2-defective tumors and that 6TG
might be used as treatment for BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutant tumors which are resistant to cisplatin chemotherapy and/or
PARP inhibitor therapy by various mechanisms.
