A proliferation of new cytotoxic and biologic agents has led to improved survival
in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC). The ability of surgery to
increase long-term survival in patients with liver and/or lung metastases also has

been firmly established. It has become increasingly difficult as the numbers and
types of treatment options have expanded to identify optimal drug combinations,
sequences, and duration and the best way to integrate systemic chemotherapy
with potentially curative surgery for metastatic lesions. For this review, the
authors examined how recent clinical trials have addressed some pertinent questions regarding the use of systemic chemotherapy and biologic agents in patients
with mCRC. Cancer 2008;112:1879–91.  2008 American Cancer Society.

he year 2007 marked the 50th anniversary of active chemotherapy (5-fluorouracil [5-FU]) for metastatic colorectal cancer
(mCRC).1,2 For 40 years, 5-FU remained the only significantly active
agent and produced response rates ranging from 10% to 20%. 5-FU
eventually was combined with leucovorin (folinic acid [LV]), and
this combination proved better than 5-FU alone.3 Subsequently, it was
demonstrated that a bimonthly infusional 5-FU and LV schedule (the
de Gramont regimen) was an effective way of administering 5-FU.4
The last decade has seen the addition of 3 cytotoxic drugs, oxaliplatin, irinotecan, and capecitabine, and 3 biologic agents, bevacizumab, cetuximab, and panitumumab (Fig. 1).5–13 The standard of
care has evolved to a fluoropyrimidine-based combination with either oxaliplatin or irinotecan (most often combined LV, 5-FU, and
oxaliplatin [FOLFOX] or combined LV, 5-FU, and irinotecan [FOLFIRI]) with the addition of bevacizumab for initial treatment for
most patients with mCRC.9,14 Several trials have demonstrated that
starting with either FOLFOX or FOLFIRI and then crossing over to
the other regimen at the time of disease progression was equivalent.12 Next, it was determined that biologic agents further enhanced
the benefits of chemotherapy. Hurwitz et al demonstrated that addition of the monoclonal antibody against vascular endothelial growth
factor (VEGF), bevacizumab, to irinotecan combined with 5-FU and
LV (IFL) extended median overall survival (OS) from 15.6 months to
20.3 months.9 Antiepidermal growth factor receptor (anti-EGFR)
antibodies (eg, cetuximab and panitumumab) subsequently were
identified that had activity alone and in combination with chemotherapy.15,16 With this relative bounty of active agents, recent clinical
research has been dedicated to determining the optimal paradigm
for combining and sequencing multiple available agents. There have

been several excellent, comprehensive reviews of systemic chemotherapy in mCRC.17–19 The objective of
this article was to discuss questions that have arisen
out of so much progress, examining the interface
between cytotoxic therapy and therapy targeting
angiogenesis (with bevacizumab) and the EGFR (eg,
using cetuximab and panitumumab), the role of
chemotherapy-free intervals, and the timing of
chemotherapy for those patients with potentially resectable liver metastases.

Initiation of Chemotherapy—When and Which?
There are conflicting data from literature in the 5FU-alone era regarding whether chemotherapy
should be initiated immediately in all newly diagnosed patients with mCRC.20–22 However, with the
proven efficacy of oxaliplatin, irinotecan, and the
anti-VEGF and anti-EGFR monoclonal antibodies,
and with evidence demonstrating that patients who
are exposed to all active agents live longer than those
who are not exposed, it has become standard practice to initiate therapy at diagnosis as long as there
are not compelling reasons to withhold therapy.23
The question of whether sequencing agents (as
long as all of them ultimately are used) either alone
or in minicombinations versus upfront combination

of multiple agents will yield the best long-term outcome still has not been answered. The results from 2
recently reported trials (the Fluorouracil, Oxaliplatin,
and Irinotecan Use and Sequencing or FOCUS trial
and the Capecitabine, Irinotecan, and Oxaliplatin or
CAIRO trial) suggested that there is no survival benefit for initial combination chemotherapy over sequential therapy.24,25 However, neither of those trials
used the majority of agents together as an initial
combination regimen, and combination therapy was
a component of overall therapy even for patients
who started with single-agent treatment. In contrast,
a randomized trial comparing FOLFOX plus irinotecan (FOLFOXIRI) with FOLFIRI did demonstrate an
improvement in OS for the group that initially
received FOLFOXIRI.26 A caveat to interpretation of
these studies is that none of them included biologic
agents as components of therapy. Therefore, the
question of whether starting with single-agent therapy and then sequencing in other agents as appropriate is equivalent to initial combination therapy
with an optimal regimen remains open. Currently,
most patients initially receive either FOLFOX or FOLFIRI in combination with bevacizumab, with the
choice based on pre-existing medical conditions and
on physician and patient preference. Patients who
may not tolerate combined chemotherapy most often

receive either single-agent capecitabine or intravenous (IV) 5-FU and LV with or without bevacizumab.

Can Capecitabine Substitute for Infusional 5-FU?
Since its synthesis, investigators have asked whether
5-FU can be given orally. There was biologic rationale that direct delivery through the portal circulation
may lead to higher intrahepatic drug concentrations.
The development of oral 5-FU fell out of favor, however, when a randomized, double-blind trial of oral
5-FU compared with IV 5-FU in patients with mCRC
demonstrated lower response rate (RR) (19.1% vs
26%) and decreased response duration (11 weeks vs
20 weeks).27 Furthermore, there was dramatic variability in blood levels of 5-FU, even within the same
patient, when it was delivered by the oral route; this
was not observed with IV 5-FU.
Much of the variable oral bioavailability of 5-FU
derives from differing levels of intestinal mucosal
dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD), which
metabolizes 5-FU. Generally, there have been 2
approaches to bypass this obstacle and achieve reliable systemic 5-FU levels. One is to coadminister a
DPD inhibitor, and the other is to give a prodrug of
5-FU that is not subject to degradation by intestinal
DPD and subsequently converted to the active compound after absorption. Examples of the former
approach include combined uracil and tegafur and

S-1, which are approved for use in other countries
but not the United States.28–31
The only oral formulation of 5-FU that currently
is approved for use in the United States is capecitabine (Xeloda), a 5-FU prodrug that is absorbed intact
across the gastrointestinal mucosa and then converted to 5-FU in 3 enzymatic steps.32 Capecitabine
has the theoretical advantage that 5-FU may be concentrated preferentially in tumor tissue because of
higher levels of 1 of these converting enzymes, thymidine phosphorylase, in tumor cells.33 However, the
clinical significance of this is not known. Two large
Phase III trials that involved >1200 patients demonstrated the equivalence of capecitabine 1250 mg/m2
twice daily compared with 5-FU/LV.13,34 However, by
the time those studies were published, the addition
of oxaliplatin and irinotecan to IV 5-FU improved
outcomes in patients with mCRC. This immediately
raised the question of whether capecitabine could
substitute for IV 5-FU in combinations such as IFL,
FOLFIRI, and FOLFOX and whether there is an interaction with the addition of biologic agents, such as
bevacizumab and cetuximab.
Capecitabine and oxaliplatin (CapeOx or XELOX)
have been compared with IV 5-FU and oxaliplatin
combinations in 5 major Phase II/III trials (Table 1).
The largest of those trials, NO16966, originally was
designed as a 2-arm study to compare XELOX (capecitabine 1000 mg/m2 twice daily on Days 1–14 and

oxaliplatin 130 mg/m2 IV every 3 weeks) versus FOLFOX4.35 After a survival benefit was demonstrated
with bevacizumab, the study was transitioned to a
2 3 2 factorial design to test the addition of bevacizumab. There was no difference in progression-free
survival (PFS) (8.5 months vs 8 months) or OS (17.1
months vs 17.5 months). Three regimens of eloxatin
in advanced colorectal cancer (TREE-1) randomized
patients to receive 3 different fluoropyrimidine-based
regimens: modified FOLFOX6 (mFOLFOX6), bolus 5FU, LV, and oxaliplatin (bFOL), and CapeOx. There
was no statistically significant difference between
mFOLFOX6 (RR, 43%; OS, 19.2 months) and CapeOx
(RR, 35%; OS, 17.2 months).36 TREE-2 randomized
patients to the same 3 fluoropyrimidine-based arms
(with the exception of a lower dose of capecitabine
at 850 mg/m2 twice daily on Days 1–14 in the
CapeOx arm) plus bevacizumab. Again, there was no
difference between the mFOLFOX6 arm (RR, 53%;
OS, 26 months) and CapeOx (RR, 48%; OS, 27
months). The bFOL arm was inferior to both mFOLFOX6 and CapeOx.36 A study that compared XELOX
with continuous-infusion 5-FU 2250 mg/m2 over 48
hours on Days 1, 8, 15, 22, 29, and 36 plus oxaliplatin
85 mg/m2 on Days 1, 15, and 29 every 6 weeks
(FUOX) indicated that there were no significant differences in efficacy: time to progression (TTP), 8.9
months versus 9.5 months (P 5 .153); median OS,
18.1 months versus 20.8 months (P 5 .145); and confirmed RR, 37% versus 46% (P 5 .539).37 A noninferiority study demonstrated no significant difference
between CapeOx and continuous-infusion 5-FU 2000
mg/m2 over 22 hours plus oxaliplatin 50 mg/m2 on
Days 1, 8, 15, and 22 every 5 weeks (FUFOX).38 The
median PFS was 7.1 months for CapeOx and 8
months for FUFOX (P 5 .117), and the median OS
was 16.8 months for CapeOx and 18.8 months for
FUFOX (P 5 .26). A higher incidence of hand-foot
syndrome with XELOX was observed across all trials.
Thus, XELOX (CapeOx) appears to be equivalent
in efficacy to a variety of IV 5-FU-based combinations with oxaliplatin. Hand-foot toxicities of capecitabine can be significant. Therefore, we believe that
it still is preferable to give infusional 5-FU/oxaliplatin
combinations. However, in situations in which an
ambulatory infusional pump is not feasible or
desired, XELOX (CapeOx) is a reasonable alternative.
Irinotecan was tested in combination with 3 different methods of fluoropyrimidine administration in
first-line treatment of patients with mCRC in the Irinotecan With or Without Bevacizumab for Colorectal
Cancer (BICC-C) trial.39 The median OS was 23.1
months for FOLFIRI, 17.6 months for modified IFL
(mIFL), and 18.9 months for combined capecitabine,

oxaliplatin, irinotecan (CapeIri). The difference between FOLFIRI and CapeIri was not statistically significant. However, compared with FOLFIRI, CapeIri
was associated with much more gastrointestinal toxicity, febrile neutropenia, and hand-foot syndrome,
and this arm subsequently was dropped from the
second phase of the BICC-C trial, which tested the
addition of bevacizumab to either FOLFIRI or mIFL.
Therefore, currently, capecitabine should not be used
to supplant IV 5-FU in combination with irinotecan,
although studies are continuing to evaluate this.

Do EGFR Levels on Tumor Cells Matter, and What Are the
Appropriate Settings for Use of Anti-EGFR Therapy?
EGFR is expressed on the surface of 60% to 80% of
all colorectal cancers40,41 and appeared to be a
rational target for drug development. Cetuximab is a
chimeric immunoglobulin G1 monoclonal antibody
that binds to EGFR and prevents ligand-induced
dimerization and receptor internalization. Several
large randomized trials have demonstrated efficacy
of cetuximab both as monotherapy and in combination with cytotoxic therapy. Despite those findings,
there is no clear correlation between EGFR expression, as measured by gene amplification or immunohistochemical staining, or EGFR kinase domain
mutations, and responsiveness to cetuximab.42,43
Therefore, the selection or exclusion of patients for
cetuximab based on EGFR status is not justified.
Cetuximab has produced an approximately 11%
RR and a median OS of 6.5 months when used as
monotherapy in patients who are refractory to 5-FU,
irinotecan, and oxaliplatin.43,44 The Bowel Oncology
with Cetuximab Antibody (BOND)-1 trial randomized
patients with irinotecan-refractory mCRC to receive
either cetuximab and irinotecan or cetuximab
alone.15 The RR (22.9% vs 10.8%) and the median
time to progression (4.1 months vs 1.5 months) were
significantly higher in the combination group than in
the cetuximab-alone group. The median OS did not
differ significantly between the combination group
and the cetuximab-alone group (8.6 months vs
6.9 months), but patients in the cetuixmab-alone
arm were allowed to cross over to combination therapy. This led to the approval of cetuximab as secondor third-line therapy in combination with irinotecan
for patients who had progressed on an irinotecancontaining regimen (Table 2).
Several important observations came out of that
trial that had implications for studies of biologic agents
in solid tumors. First, cetuximab restored irinotecan
sensitivity in some patients who had clearly demonstrated refractoriness to the drug, illustrating the principle that biologic agents may exert part of their

beneficial effect by circumventing drug resistance to
cytotoxic agents. Second, there was no correlation
between EGFR expression (as measured currently) and
responsiveness to cetuximab. Third, there was a strong
correlation between the development of acneiform
rash and cetuximab responsiveness. In the cetuximabirinotecan arm, the RR was only 6.3% for patients without a rash, but the RR was 25.8% in patients with any
rash, and the RR increased with the increased severity
of the rash. For patients with a grade 1 or 2 skin reaction, the RR was 20.4%; and, for patients with a grade 3
or 4 rash, the RR increased to 55.2%. The same statistically significant trend was observed in the cetuximabalone arm. The biologic reasons for this correlation
currently remain unknown.
The Phase II BOND-2 trial explored the benefit
of the further addition of anti-VEGF therapy to these
agents. Bevacizumab, cetuximab, and irinotecan were
compared with bevacizumab and cetuximab alone in
irinotecan-refractory patients45 The triple-drug combination produced an RR of 35% compared with 23%
with bevacizumab and cetuximab alone, and the TTP
improved from 4.9 months to 7.3 months. All
patients were naive to bevacizumab and cetuximab
at the time they entered the trial, which makes it difficult to interpret and apply results from this study
in clinical care given the general practice of administering bevacizumab as first-line therapy. Currently,
this question is being addressed in an ongoing Phase
III trial for patients who previously received bevacizumab-containing chemotherapy.
Several major studies have examined a possible
role for cetuximab in the first-line. The Phase III Cetuximab Combined With Irinotecan in First-Line Therapy
for Metastatic Colorectal Cancer (CRYSTAL) study compared cetuximab plus FOLFIRI with FOLFIRI alone in
patients with mCRC.46 Preliminary results indicated
that the median PFS was 8.9 months for patients who

were randomized to receive cetuximab plus FOLFIRI
versus 8 months for patients who were randomized to
receive FOLFIRI alone (P 5 .036). Diarrhea was moderately worse and skin reactions were significantly worse
in the cetuximab arm. Cancer and Leukemia Group B
(CALGB) Trial 80,203 randomized patients with mCRC
to receive either FOLFIRI or FOLFOX in the first-line
setting with cetuximab or with a placebo.47 In a preliminary report, response rates were significantly higher
with the addition of cetuximab (60% vs 40% for FOLFOX
plus cetuximab vs FOLFOX alone; 44% vs 36% for FOLFIRI plus cetuximab vs FOLFIRI alone). No conclusions
could be made regarding any possible improvement in
PFS or OS. Currently, to determine the potential benefit
of using both anti-VEGF and anti-EGFR agents upfront,
CALGB Trial 80,405 is randomizing newly diagnosed
patients with mCRC to receive either FOLFOX or FOLFIRI (investigator’s choice) with randomized addition of
bevacizumab, cetuximab, or both.
Given the apparent correlation of response to
cetuximab with the severity of rash, investigators
examined an approach of cetuximab dose escalation
in patients with mCRC who had no or slight skin
reaction to cetuximab at standard doses (the Evaluation of Various Erbitux Regimens by Means of Skin
Tumor Biopsies or EVEREST trial).48 Patients were
required to have tumors that expressed EGFR and
must have progressed through an irinotecan-containing regimen. Three weeks after they started cetuximab (Erbitux; 400 mg/m2 as an initial loading dose
followed by 250 mg/m2 weekly with irinotecan 180
mg/m2 every 2 weeks), patients who had not experienced greater than a grade 1 skin reaction were randomized either to continue standard-dose cetuximab
(250 mg/m2 weekly) or to receive dose-escalated
cetuximab (increased by 50 mg/m2 every 2 weeks
until they had either greater than grade 2 toxicity, had
a tumor response, or reached a dose of 500 mg/m2).

1884

Preliminary results indicated an RR of 13% in the
standard-dose arm versus 30% in the dose-escalated
arm, demonstrating the potential for using pharmacodynamic endpoints to guide therapy in real time.
A second monoclonal antibody against the
EGFR, panitumumab, has been approved for the
treatment of patients who have progressed on standard therapy for mCRC.16 It has the theoretical advantage over cetuximab of being fully humanized and,
thus, having a lower, although still present, risk of
infusion reactions.49,50 In addition, its longer half-life
allows for a bimonthly schedule compared with the
weekly schedule of cetuximab. However, preliminary
studies suggest that higher doses of cetuximab may
be deliverable on an every 2-week or possibly 3-week
schedule,51 but this needs confirmation in further
studies. To date, it has not been demonstrated that
panitumumab improves the efficacy of chemotherapy when used in combination.
In summary, cetuximab should be used as second- or third-line therapy in combination with irinotecan and can be used as a single agent for patients
who are intolerant of irinotecan. Areas of current
investigation include the role of cetuximab in combination with oxaliplatin-containing regimens, the use
of cetuximab as first-line therapy with or without
bevacizumab, the role of dose-escalating cetuximab
in the absence of a skin reaction, and the potential
for altering the cetuximab schedule. Panitumumab is
approved as a single agent for patients who have
progressed on prior therapies. Its potential uses in
combination with chemotherapy are being explored.

Should Bevacizumab Therapy Be Continued at
Progression?
Evidence suggests that angiogenesis is critical to the
growth and metastases of tumors.52–55 Bevacizumab
is a humanized monoclonal antibody directed against
VEGF, which is important in tumor angiogenesis, and
improves survival when it is used in combination
with chemotherapy. Currently, bevacizumab an integral component of first-line therapy for mCRC and
most often is combined with FOLFOX or FOLFIRI.9,14
It is not known whether the primary contribution
of bevacizumab stems from a direct antiangiogenic
effect or from normalization of tumor microvasculature that facilitates the delivery of cytotoxic chemotherapy. In 2001, Rakesh Jain proposed that agents
like bevacizumab may not effect tumor cell death
purely through ‘‘antiangiogenesis’’ and provided an
alternative paradigm in which ‘‘normalization’’ of tumor microvasculature leads to improved delivery and
retention of chemotherapeutic agents in tumors.56
The observation that single-agent bevacizumab has

very little activity against mCRC lends clinical support to this hypothesis. In a Phase I study of neoadjuvant therapy in patients with rectal cancer, Willett
et al investigated effects of VEGF blockade with bevacizumab.57 After a single dose of bevacizumab, there
were decreases in blood perfusion and blood volume
in tumors on dynamic computed tomography (CT)
scans, decreases in microvascular density on tissue
biopsy, and decreases in interstitial fluid pressure in
tumors. This provided supportive evidence in human
cancer that antiangiogenic therapy can mediate both
a decrease in overall microvasculature and some
‘‘normalization’’ of aberrant tumor vessels.
With this in mind, the clinician often is faced
with the issue of whether to continue bevacizumab
while switching to an alternative chemotherapy after
a patient progresses on a first-line bevacizumab-containing regimen. The most significant data that
address this clinical question come from an observational, nonrandomized registration trial (the Bevacizumab Regimens Investigation of Treatment Effects
and Safety or BRiTE trial).58 At time of progressive disease, the treating physician decided whether or not
bevacizumab would be continued with second-line
chemotherapy. The median OS was longer in patients
who received bevacizumab beyond progression versus
patients who did not (31.8 months vs 19.9 months).
These data appear consistent with the hypothesis that
bevacizumab may potentiate chemotherapy delivery
but are subject to significant selection bias, and no
definite conclusions can be drawn. A higher proportion of patients had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology
Group performance status of 0 (50.2% vs 39.9%)
among those who received bevacizumab beyond progression, suggesting that healthier patients and/or
patients with less aggressive tumor biology were
assigned to receive bevacizumab therapy. There are
no current data from prospectively randomized studies to support continuing bevacizumab beyond progression. Several clinical trials are investigating this
approach, including the Intergroup trial S0600/iBET,
which randomizes patients who have progressed on
FOLFOX and bevacizumab to an irinotecan-cetuximab combination with or without bevacizumab.

Can Patients Take a Chemotherapy Holiday?
The optimum duration of chemotherapy in patients
with mCRC has never been established.59 With
patients living for an average of 20 to 24 months and
increasing appreciation of long-term neurotoxicity
from oxaliplatin, the questions of how much chemotherapy and for how long have attained increasing
importance. There are some patients for whom the
idea of being off chemotherapy is psychologically dis-

tressing, and recommending a chemotherapy-free
interval, short of significant toxicity, is simply counterproductive. However, for many patients with
mCRC, chemotherapy breaks might lead to a decrease
in toxicity and improvement in quality of life. Several
recent trials have examined whether predefined
breaks or attenuations in chemotherapy can lead to
equivalent survival with less toxicity (Table 3).
In the OPTIMOX1 study, previously untreated
patients with mCRC were assigned randomly to either FOLFOX4 every 2 weeks until progression or
unacceptable toxicity (continuation arm) versus FOLFOX7 for 6 cycles, followed by maintenance 5-FU
and LV without oxaliplatin for 12 cycles, and then
reintroduction of FOLFOX7 (maintenance arm).60
This trial design required use of the endpoint duration of disease control (DDC), which was defined as
the PFS; or, if FOLFOX was reintroduced, DDC was
defined as the addition of the initial PFS and the PFS
after reintroduction of FOLFOX. The median PFS and
OS were 9 months and 19.3 months, respectively, in
the continuation arm and 8.7 months and 21.2
months, respectively, in the maintenance arm and
were not statistically different. The RR was 58.5%
with continuation of FOLFOX and 59.2% for maintenance. Grade 3 and 4 toxicity were less common in
the maintenance arm after Cycle 7, although overall
toxicity was similar in both arms (54.4% in the continuation arm vs 48.7% in the maintenance arm).
Greater than 60% of patients in each arm went on to
receive irinotecan-based regimens after progression.
Only 40% of patients in the maintenance arm had
oxaliplatin reintroduced after the 12 cycles of 5-FU
and LV. This, along with comparable survival of the
arms, suggests that the primary benefit of oxaliplatin
was derived from early cycles. Although it has not

been defined completely, these data suggest that a
limited number of courses6–12 may be sufficient to
achieve most of the clinical benefit of oxaliplatin
treatment. For patients who develop early signs of
neurotoxicity who have achieved a response or stable
disease, an attenuation of therapy to 5-FU and LV
alone can be proposed reasonably, particularly for
those with favorable prognostic features.
In a slightly different approach than OPTIMOX1,
the Italian Group for the Study of Cancers of the Digestive System (GISCAD) randomized patients with
previously untreated mCRC to receive either FOLFIRI
for 2 months on and then 2 months off (intermittent
arm) versus FOLFIRI continuously (continuous
arm).61 Patients were treated until progression. The
RR was 29% in the intermittent arm and 35% in the
continuous arm. At 27 months of follow-up, the median OS was 16.9 months in the intermittent arm
compared with 17.6 months in the continuous arm
(hazard ratio, 1.11; 95% confidence interval, 0.83–
1.48). Similar numbers of patients in both arms
(59.1% vs 54.5%) received second-line oxaliplatinbased chemotherapy. Toxicity was similar in the 2
arms. These data are preliminary but suggest the possibility that intermittent therapy, at least with FOLFIRI and on a schedule of 2 months on and 2 months
off, may be equivalent to continuous therapy.
The OPTIMOX2 trial evaluated whether patients
could stop chemotherapy altogether after 6 cycles of
FOLFOX.7.62 In that study, patients were randomized
to receive either 6 cycles of FOLFOX7 followed by 5FU and LV until progression and then reintroduction
of FOLFOX7 (OPTIMOX1 arm) versus 6 cycles of
FOLFOX7 followed by complete cessation of chemotherapy until tumor progression (OPTIMOX2 arm).

can Society for Clinical Oncology demonstrated a
strong trend toward inferior survival in the OPTIMOX2 arm compared with the OPTIMOX1 arm (18.9
months vs 24.6 months; P 5 .05).
In summary, can patients who develop early
signs of neurotoxicity get a break from oxaliplatin in
FOLFOX after they achieve a partial response or
stable disease? Yes. Can patients take a break from
chemotherapy entirely? Perhaps, but with caution.
Data from GISCAD provide some evidence for this
approach, at least in patients who have responded to
first-line FOLFIRI. How long can patients be off
chemotherapy? Not too long. Data from OPTIMOX2
provide a cautionary note that patients cannot be
taken off all chemotherapy for a prolonged period
without hazarding a compromise in survival. These
trials did not include bevacizumab with initial chemotherapy, and it is unknown whether there is an
interaction between biologic agents and chemotherapy that may have an impact on the safety or efficacy of a chemotherapy-free interval, in one
direction or another. The question of whether biologic maintenance therapy with anti-VEGF or antiEGFR agents can reduce time on chemotherapy without significantly sacrificing long-term survival is
being addressed in several randomized trials. In the
meantime, it is incumbent upon the clinician to convey to the patient there is no one right approach and
that the intensity and duration of chemotherapy has
to be tailored to the individual based on his or her
response, tolerance, and preference.

What Is the Role of Chemotherapy for Patients With
Resectable Liver and/or Lung Lesions?
Liver resection is the only potentially curative therapy
for patients with mCRC and isolated liver metastases.

Older series demonstrated 5-year OS rates that ranged
from 20% to 38%.63 Contemporary series from Johns
Hopkins and the M. D. Anderson Cancer Center have
reported 5-year OS rates as high as 58%,64,65 reflecting
a combination of advances in surgical technique and
experience, refinement of prognostic factors, use of
positron emission tomography with F-18 fluorodeoxyglucose to improve patient selection, and newer
methods to expand resectability, such as portal vein
embolization.66 In addition, some of these patients
received chemotherapy after resection, and it is possible that the incorporation of oxaliplatin and irinotecan have contributed to their prolonged survival
compared with historical controls. However, these
surgical series were not designed to look at chemotherapy effect, so no definitive conclusions about possible benefits of chemotherapy can be drawn.
Several important, unanswered questions remain
regarding the optimal integration of systemic chemotherapy with hepatic metastectomy. First, should all
patients receive ‘‘adjuvant’’ chemotherapy? Second,
what is the best chemotherapy regimen? Third,
should chemotherapy be given before or after surgery or both?
Few completed studies have evaluated whether or
not chemotherapy improves outcomes when it is given
after a potentially curative liver resection (Table 4).
Two randomized trials closed early because of slow
accrual. A pooled analysis of the French trial (French
Foundation for the Study of Digestive Cancers
[FFCD] 9002) and the English trial (European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer
[EORTC]/National Cancer Institute of Canada)
included 278 patients with mCRC who had undergone complete (R0) resection of the primary tumor
and 4 liver or lung metastases and randomized 138

Questions in Treating Metastatic CRC/Zuckerman and Clark

patients to receive 6 cycles of 5-FU and LV for 5 days
every 28 days and 140 patients to undergo surgery
alone. There was a trend toward improved 5-year
PFS (36% vs 30%; P 5 .059) and improved 5-year OS
(53% vs 41%; P 5 .125) favoring chemotherapy over
surgery alone, but this did not reach statistical significance.67
The FFCD 9002 final results have been published
separately. One hundred seventy-three patients
who underwent R0 resection were randomized to
6 months of 5-FU and LV compared with surgery
alone.68 The 5-year disease-free survival rate was
33.5% for patients in the chemotherapy group and
26.7% for patients in the observation group
(P 5 .028). Again, a trend toward increased 5-year OS
(51.1% vs 41.1%, respectively) was observed but did
not reach statistical significance. The use of 5-FU
and LV alone was the standard at the time the trial
was designed, and it is possible the magnitude of
benefit would be larger with the use of FOLFOX or
even, if these cases are considered stage IV with no
evidence of disease, FOLFOX and bevacizumab.
A full discussion of liver-directed therapies is
beyond the scope of this article, but there have been
multiple studies evaluating adjuvant hepatic artery
infusion (HAI) of either 5-FU or floxuridine (FUDR)
with or without systemic chemotherapy versus either
observation or systemic chemotherapy with 5-FU
and LV. Three trials have demonstrated an overall
disease-free survival benefit for HAI plus systemic
chemotherapy over chemotherapy alone,69–71 but
these were small, single-institution trials, and toxicity
and technical aspects of implanting and maintaining
a hepatic arterial pump have limited its applicability
in the community at large. Furthermore, these studies were published at the same time that more
effective and convenient, systemic chemotherapy
was being developed, bringing into question the role
of liver-directed therapy in the setting of better systemic agents. Small studies have evaluated the incorporation of new agents (eg, oxaliplatin or irinotecan)
into liver-directed therapy; however, currently, this
remains investigational.
In conclusion, when the results of the FFCD adjuvant trial are placed in the context of the Multicenter International Study of Oxaliplatin/5-Fluorouracil,
Lecovorin in the Adjuvant Treatment of Colon Cancer
or MOSAIC trial and National Surgical Adjuvant
Breast and Bowel Project (NSABP) C-07 trial, there is
some evidence supporting the use of adjuvant chemotherapy after an R0 resection of hepatic metastases
in patients with mCRC. In addition, data from the
study evaluating combined preoperative and postoperative FOLFOX chemotherapy (see below) also

1887

lends support to a benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy after resection of liver metastases, although a definitive survival advantage has not been established
to date.72 FOLFOX may turn out to be superior to 5FU and LV in this setting.
The possible role of preoperative chemotherapy
for patients with hepatic metastases from mCRC has
generated considerable debate. Several arguments
have been made in favor of preoperative chemotherapy. First, it allows testing the sensitivity of the tumor in vivo to chemotherapy. If the tumor responds,
then this would argue for more of the same chemotherapy after resection. However, this approach has
never been validated. The regression of a liver lesion
on a CT scan provides information only about the
sensitivity of that specific lesion, which ultimately is
going to be resected anyway. It does not take into
account that other micrometastatic disease, for
which a response cannot be assessed, may not have
the same chemosensitivity profile.
Second, it provides a window for biologically
aggressive disease to declare itself with distant metastases or intrahepatic progression and thereby
avoid unnecessary surgery. A counterargument is
that a hepatic metastasis, if resectable, should be
removed immediately before it has a chance to grow
or give rise to further metastases. A metastasis may
prove to be chemoresistant and, indeed, may progress given the passage of several cycles of ineffective
chemotherapy.
Third, neoadjuvant chemotherapy allows the surgeon to resect a smaller metastasis, presumably leading to less surgical morbidity and providing the
patient with a more robust liver remnant. However, it
needs to be borne in mind that preoperative chemotherapy potentially can be too effective. One study
demonstrated that, among 31 liver metastases that
had achieved a complete radiographic response to
preoperative chemotherapy and subsequently were
not resected because they could not be identified at
surgery, 23 were sites of recurrence at 1 year.73 If the
hepatic lesions are rendered so small that the surgeon can no longer find them intraoperatively, then
the patient may have been done a disservice by preoperative chemotherapy.
One of the strongest arguments made in opposition to preoperative chemotherapy is emerging evidence for chemotherapy-associated liver injury.
Multiple studies have demonstrated steatohepatitis
and sinusoidal dilatation and congestion in the nontumor-bearing liver in resected specimens after exposure to preoperative chemotherapy. One study
suggested an increase in 90-day surgical mortality in
those patients who had developed stetatohepatitis,

1888

which was associated primarily with preoperative irinotecan.74
Some of these concepts were put to the test in
an important trial by the EORTC. Patients with up to
4 potentially resectable liver metastases of mCRC
(metachronous or synchronous) and no extrahepatic
disease were randomized either to receive perioperative chemotherapy with 6 cycles of FOLFOX4, followed by surgery, followed by 6 more cycles of
FOLFOX4 or to undergo surgery alone.72 Compliance
with preoperative chemotherapy was relatively high,
with 78.6% of patients completing all 6 cycles. In a
preliminary report, the overall 3 year PFS rate was
improved from 28.1% in the surgery alone arm to
35.4% in the perioperative FOLFOX arm (P 5 .058).
No patients in the FOLFOX arm failed to make it to
surgery because of chemotherapy complications. OS
was not an endpoint in that trial, and it is unclear
whether perioperative FOLFOX actually contributes
to cure or simply delays recurrence. Furthermore, the
trial was not designed to test the value of preoperative versus postoperative chemotherapy and did not
definitively answer the persistent question about the
optimal timing of chemotherapy around curative
resection for liver metastases of mCRC.
Given the current evidence, a patient with from
1 to 4 liver metastases who is deemed by the surgeon
to have a high likelihood of safely achieving an
R0 resection reasonably could undergo surgery first
and consider adjuvant therapy afterward. Alternatively, given data from the EORTC trial, a combination of preoperative and postoperative chemotherapy
also would be reasonable but with the caveats discussed above for preoperative treatment. Patients
who have potentially resectable hepatic metastases
but for whom the ability to achieve complete resection is unclear should be treated with systemic
chemotherapy initially and monitored closely for
response. If metastatic disease converts to a resectable state, then surgery is certainly a consideration for
these patients. Whether patients with mCRC who are
rendered resectable by initial chemotherapy have
the same long-term survival as those patients
who presented with resectable disease remains to be
determined.
The potential benefit of integrating bevacizumab
or cetuximab into chemotherapy regimens in this
setting currently is being evaluated in several trials.
Although the role of adjuvant, neoadjuvant, or perioperative chemotherapy has not yet been studied in
the setting of resected lung metastases, it is reasonable to assume that the data generated from the use
of systemic chemotherapy approaches for resected
liver metastases also should apply to that setting.

Are There Markers That Predict Response or
Development of Toxicity?
There is an ongoing effort to identify molecular and
genetic factors that may predict response or toxicity
to a specific therapy and that could be used to tailor
therapy for each patient. The presence of EGFR (at
least as it is detected currently) on tumor cells does
not correlate with response to anti-EGFR therapy, as
discussed above, nor is there convincing evidence
that VEGF or VEGF receptor levels correlate with
response to bevacizumab treatment. However, there
are several tests that potentially may be useful for
defining toxicity or responsiveness. UGT1A1 (the
enzyme that glucuronidates SN38, the active metabolite of irinotecan) polymorphisms may predict toxicity with irinotecan therapy. Individuals who are
homozygous for certain polymorphisms, such as
UGT1A1*28, have a greater likelihood of developing
early hematologic toxicity.75,76 The test is available
commercially and potentially is useful for patients in
whom there is increased concern for irinotecanrelated toxicity. DPD, which is an essential enzyme in
5-FU metabolism to inactive compounds and, thus,
in determining tolerance of the drug, also can be
assayed.77 However, currently, this is available only
in the research setting. There is some evidence that
polymorphisms in glutathione S-transferase genes
may correlate with toxicity to oxaliplatin, although
this needs confirmation in additional studies.78
The presence of certain mutations or levels of
several enzymes in cancer cells may predict responsiveness to specific agents and allow the ability to
tailor chemotherapy for the individual patient.79 For
example, KRAS mutations in cancer cells may predict
for lack of response to anti-EGFR therapy.80 Tumors
with mutations in genes that are important for mismatch repair may not be as responsive to 5-FU
chemotherapy as tumors without these mutations.81
Evaluation of these and other potential predictors of
response to specific agents need additional confirmation before they can be used in making treatment
decisions for individual patients. However, as knowledge about the role of these and other markers for
potential treatment responsiveness and toxicity is
increased, there should be additional tools to help
optimize therapeutic choices for each patient.
Conclusion
5-FU was the only effective drug to treat mCRC for
nearly 40 years. In the last decade, 3 cytotoxic agents
(capecitabine, irinotecan, and oxaliplatin) and 3
monoclonal antibodies directed against VEGF (bevacizumab) and EGFR (cetuximab, panitumumab), in
conjunction with increased use of surgery for iso-

lated liver and/or lung metastases, have served to
double the median length of survival for patients
with mCRC. Clinical trials have provided some
insights into how best to integrate these agents into
the care of individual patients. However, several
questions remain, some of which are being
addressed in ongoing clinical trials. There continues
to be progress in understanding both the biology of
colorectal cancer and the individual patient characteristics that affect tolerance of and response to therapy. All of these advances should improve the care of
patients with colorectal cancer as they are developed
into clinically relevant ideas.
