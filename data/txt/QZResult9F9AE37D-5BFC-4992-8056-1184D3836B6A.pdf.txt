ABSTRACT
Gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST) exhibit a strong oncogenic dependency
on KIT and KIT inhibitors confer long lasting disease stabilization in the majority
of patients. Nonetheless, KIT inhibition alone does not cure GIST as a subset of
GIST cells evade apoptosis and eventually develop resistance. Inhibitors of Apoptosis
Proteins (IAPs) may confer resistance to drug-induced apoptosis. We observed
that the mRNA and protein of IAPs XIAP (BIRC4) and survivin (BIRC5) were highly
expressed in primary GIST tumors and cell line models. Amplification of the respective
gene loci (BIRC2, BIRC3, BIRC4, BIRC5) was detected in 47% of GIST studied by SNP
arrays. Whole exome analyses revealed a mutation of SMAC(DIABLO) in a heavily
pretreated patient. Both, survivin (rank 62-92/11.194 tested proteins) and XIAP
(rank 106-557/11.194) were found to be essential proteins for survival in a synthetic
lethality screen. Expression of XIAP and survivin decreased upon KIT inhibition and
may play a role in KIT-regulated pro-survival signaling. SMAC-mimetic treatment with
LCL161 and TL32711 reduced cIAP1 and XIAP expression. Survivin inhibitor YM155
lead to transcriptional repression of BIRC5/survivin (YM155) and induced apoptosis.
Combinational treatment with KIT inhibitors (imatinib, regorafenib) enhanced the
proapoptotic effect. These findings support the combination of KIT inhibition with
IAP antagonists in GIST.

patients eventually progress and die of their disease [3].
Notably, tumor specimens from patients who underwent
metastasectomy following objective remission from
imatinib frequently feature viable tumor cells [4].
Secondary KIT mutations have been shown to confer
imatinib resistance but mechanisms that help GIST cells
to evade apoptosis despite effective KIT inhibition are
not completely understood [5, 6]. Both autophagy and
quiescence have been shown to protect GIST cells from
apoptosis [7, 8, 9], but the role of Inhibitors of Apoptosis
Proteins (IAPs) has not yet been studied in GIST.
IAPs are essential regulators of apoptosis preventing
caspase activation or interfering with proapoptotic
signaling intermediates, such as SMAC/DIABLO (Second
mitochondria-derived activator of caspases) [10]. Cellular
IAPs (cIAP1, encoded by BIRC2 and cIAP2, encoded by
BIRC3), X-linked IAP (XIAP, encoded by BIRC4), and
survivin (encoded by BIRC5) are frequently overexpressed
in tumors, while being absent in most adult differentiated
tissues. In many malignancies, including sarcomas,
amplification or high expression of XIAP and survivin
correlates with poor prognosis [11, 12, 13, 14, 15].
Following the discovery of IAPs and their potential
role in cancer survival, several small molecule IAP
inhibitors have been developed, some of which are
currently being tested in phase I and II clinical trials.
Among these, SMAC mimetics and survivin inhibitors
have shown the greatest clinical promise to date [16, 17].
We sought to elucidate the physiological and
pathogenic role of IAPs in a GIST cellular context and
their possible role for TKI treatment resistance.

time and confluence. The lowest survivin expression levels
were observed 24h after plating at low confluence, with a
1.7-fold increase after 48 hours. Endogeneous apoptosis
was highest on day 1 (Supplementary Figure S1). The
mRNA and protein of cIAP1 were detectable in all GIST
cell lines (Figure 1B). cIAP2 was not evaluable at protein
level and RT-PCR revealed low levels of cIAP2 mRNA
expression in GIST cell lines. In qRT-PCR experiments,
survivin mRNA levels (Figure 1C) were lower in the KITpositive GIST cell lines than in KIT-negative GIST48B.
Expression of survivin in GIST48B was similar to the
control cell lines Hela and MCF7 [18]. Of note, patient
9, who displayed high mRNA (approx. 5-fold, compared
average) and protein levels of survivin was found to
have a chromosomal amplification of 17q, containing the
survivin gene locus (Figure 1C, Table 1). Patients 2 and
7 had similar levels of survivin mRNA that were 1.6-fold
higher than in KIT-positive cell lines. Using qRT-PCR,
all cell lines and primary tumors were tested for survivin
isoforms 1, 2 (survivin-ΔEx3) and 3 (survivin-2B). The
expression of survivin-ΔEx3 was 96% lower than isoform
1, whereas survivin-2B was not detectable (Figure 1D).

Survivin is the most essential IAP for survival
of GIST cells in a lentiviral synthetic lethality
screen
A synthetic lethality screen featuring 11,194 genes
was conducted in GIST-T1, GIST882 and GIST430654 with and without KIT-inhibitory treatment [19].
Genes were then ranked, with rank 1 signifying the most
essential and rank 11,194 the least essential gene for cell
proliferation (Figure 2). Survivin was the highest ranking
IAP in all untreated cell lines (rank 62-92) and remained
important under KIT inhibition in GIST882 and GIST430654 (ranks 304 and 110, respectively) In GIST-T1,
survivin proved less essential under KIT inhibition
(rank 1614). XIAP was the second most essential IAP
and ranked 106 to 557 in GIST-T1 and GIST430 but not
essential in GIST882 (rank 4819). Cellular IAPs were
non-essential.

RESULTS
cIAP1, XIAP and survivin are highly expressed
in primary GIST and GIST cell lines
First, IAP protein expression was examined in 20
GIST tumors and 6 cell lines, using western blot, qRTPCR and reverse transcriptase PCR (Figure 1). At the
protein level, cIAP1 was expressed in 84% (n=19),
survivin was expressed in 80%and XIAP in 75% of
primary GIST (n=20; Figure 1A) and in all GIST cell
lines (Figure 1B). Expression levels were highest in
rapidly growing GIST-T1 when compared to the average
of primary tumors (XIAP 60% of GIST-T1, survivin 50%
of GIST-T1 expression levels; Figure 1A) with exception
of cIAP1, where expression levels were comparable to
GIST-T1 with variable expression ranging from 27 to
200% of GIST-T1 expression levels. Expression levels of
KIT and KIT phosphorylation did not correlate with IAP
expression levels (Figure 1A, 1B). IAP expression levels
did not correlate with localization or stage of disease
(Supplementary Table S1). As we observed varying degrees
of survivin expression in independent experiments, we
studied how survivin and XIAP levels related to culturing

IAP copy number variations are common events
in GIST
Single Nucleotide Polymorphism Array (SNP) data
from 38 GIST were analyzed for copy number variations
of IAP loci, which could be found in 47.4% of all tumors.
7.9% carried variations in 2 different IAP loci (Table 2,
Supplementary Table S2, Supplementary Figure S2).
Amplification of IAP loci was found in 15 cases, while
loss of heterozygosity (LOH) of the BIRC2/3 locus was
found in 5. In 3 tumors, 2 or more different IAP-associated
gene loci were amplified or exhibited LOH of cIAPs. Copy
number alterations occurred in patients with localized and
metastasized disease. There was no correlation between

cell lines. YM155 blocks transcription of survivin by
interfering with survivin-specific transcription factors
[22, 23]. Viability assays with increasing doses of
YM155 revealed IC50 values in the low nanomolar
scale (5 to 80nM) in all cell lines but GIST430-654
(>1000nM; Figure 4A). Notably, survivin mRNA-levels
were reduced by 30% after 24h and 90% after 48 hours
of treatment with YM155 10nM in GIST-T1 (Figure 4B).
In Western Blot experiments, expression of survivin was
inhibited after 24-48 hours of treatment in all examined
cell lines (Figure 4C, 4D). Dose-response experiments
showed reduction of survivin at low nanomolar doses
of YM155 (10-30nM; Figure 4C) and in GIST430
and GIST-T1 concomitant decrease of XIAP could be
observed. YM155 induced PARP cleavage in all tested
cell lines at concentrations of 10 to 100nM (Figure
4C). Notably, time course experiments with YM155 in
GIST-T1 revealed apoptosis preceding the reduction
of survivin expression (data not shown). Combined
treatment with imatinib (IM) and YM155 had significant
agonistic antiproliferative effects in imatinib-resistant
GIST48 (p=0,006, compared to single YM and IM),
imatinib-resistant GIST430-654 (p<0,001, compared
to single YM) and imatinib-sensitive GIST430 (p=0,01
compared to single IM, Figure 4E), whereas only minor
increase of apoptosis, as measured by PARP cleavage,
was observed (Figure 4D)

disease status and IAP alterations. LOH in cIAP genes
was observed in patients with localized disease only. In
one patient, disease status was unknown (Supplementary
Table S2).

Mutations of negative IAP regulators are rare
Several negative regulators have been described for
cIAPs, XIAP and survivin including SMAC/DIABLO,
Omi/HTRA2, GSPT1/eRF3, XAF-1, TRAF3 and TP53
[16, 17, 20, 21]. Whole exome sequencing data from
22 patients with high-risk or metastatic GIST (82% of
samples were from patients with metastatic disease of
whom 61% were resistant to at least IM) were analyzed
for presence of inactivating mutations. TP53 mutations
were found in 2 patients and 1 patient had a copy loss. One
patient exhibited a frameshift mutation affecting the amino
acid T104 of the SMAC(DIABLO) gene. No mutations
were found for TRAF3, OMI/HTRA2, XAF1 and GSPT1/
eRF3a.

The activity of XIAP and survivin may be coregulated by KIT signaling
To evaluate the influence of KIT signaling on IAP
regulation, imatinib-sensitive and imatinib-resistant cell
lines were treated with imatinib (1μM) or regorafenib
(1μM) for up to 72 hours (Figure 3). To assess KITindependent cytotoxic effects of imatinib on IAP
expression, the KIT-negative cell line GIST48B was
treated with imatinib. As expected, strong inhibitory
effects on KIT autophosphorylation and KIT signaling
intermediates (phospho-AKT) were observed starting
as early as 5 minutes. In GIST-T1, GIST430-654 and
GIST882 apoptosis, as measured by PARP cleavage, was
induced after 3 to 24 hours. XIAP expression decreased
in GIST-T1, GIST430-654 and GIST48 but interestingly
not in GIST430 and GIST882 (Figure 3A). The expression
of cIAP1 protein was not changed by KIT inhibition.
Survivin decreased simultaneously in all KIT-positive
cell lines after 24-48 hours. In line with these findings,
survivin mRNA was markedly reduced in GIST430,
GIST430-654 and GIST48 (97, 63 and 90%, respectively),
while there was only a 27% reduction in GIST-T1
(Figure 3B). Notably, survivin protein levels showed the
latest decrease in GIST882 (72h time point) which was
paralleled with an increase of survivin mRNA levels
(143%). KIT-inhibitory treatment did not influence IAP
protein expression and survivin mRNA in KIT-negative
GIST48B (Supplementary Figure S3).

SMAC mimetics downregulate XIAP and induce
apoptosis
XIAP and cIAP1 were inhibited by SMAC-mimetic
compounds TL32711 (TL) and LCL161 (LCL), which
mimic the XIAP- and cIAP-inhibitory interaction of
SMAC and IAPs to allow caspase cleavage and apoptosis
[24]. Cell viability experiments with TL32711 and
LCL161 displayed a differential potency in the GIST cell
line panel. After six days of treatment with TL32711, IC50
values from 0.09 (GIST430) to >20μM (GIST48B) were
observed (Figure 5A). Treatment with LCL161 resulted
in IC50 values from 1 to >20μM with GIST430-654, 430
and GIST48B being the most sensitive cell lines (1, 4,
5μM, respectively, Figure 5A). Combinational treatment
with KIT inhibitors and TL32711 showed agonistic
antiproliferative effects in GIST-T1, GIST430 and GIST48
(Supplementary Figure S4). Agonistic effects of LCL161
and KIT inhibitors on cell viability could not be observed
(data not shown). To assess the proapoptotic effect of
single agents TL and LCL and combinations with tyrosine
kinase inhibitors, Caspase Glo assays were performed. In
GIST-T1 and GIST430, synergistic proapoptotic effects
were observed (Supplementary Figure S5). lIn western
blot experiments after 24 hours of treatment, cIAP1
expression was reduced by more than 69% (10nM) in
all cell lines, whereas XIAP was downregulated by both
inhibitors in GIST430 and by TL32711 in GIST430-654

and pro-apoptotic effects in GIST cell lines

and GIST882 only (Figure 5B-5C, Supplementary Figure
S6). LCL161 showed the same effects on XIAP at 100 –
500 fold higher concentrations in GIST430. Survivin was
downregulated by the similar concentrations of TL32711
and LCL161 (Figure 5B, 5C). Apoptosis, as measured
by cleavage of PARP, was induced in all cell lines tested
except in GIST48 and GIST48B. In general, KIT and KITdependent signaling (phospho-AKT) was not significantly
affected by LCL161 (Figure 5B, 5C). Agonistic induction
of PARP cleavage was observed in GIST430 and GIST-T1
(1.4- to 5.5-fold/1.0- to 10.4-fold increase compared to
single agent IM and LCL/TL, respectively).

in molecular weight of survivin and double bands, most
notably in tumor lysates, but also in GIST cell lines, may
result from ubiquitinylation of proteins.
It has previously been shown that the loss of
survivin triggers mitotic defects and cell death [17], and
XIAP-deficient cells are sensitized to radiation-induced
apoptosis [26]. Cellular IAPs are not required for cell
survival, but the loss of both cIAPs impairs pro-survival
signaling (TNFα-mediated NF-κB activation) [27]. In
synthetic lethality studies for IAP family proteins using
a shRNA screen, survivin, as would be expected due
to its essential role in mitosis [16], ranked among the
top hundred essential proteins for cell proliferation
in untreated GIST cell lines (Figure 2). Notably, KIT
inhibition decreased the essentiality of survivin in all three
cell lines. This indicates that targeting survivin in GIST
may in part depend on the level of proliferation of cells.
Apart from survivin, XIAP showed a high essentiality in
two out of three cell lines while cIAPs, when knockeddown alone, were not essential regardless of a treatment.
IAP expression is commonly altered in cancer
and associated with unfavorable prognosis [11, 12, 13,
14, 15]. Unfortunately the number of low risk, localized
GIST was too low to determine whether genomic changes
involving IAP family gene loci are early or late events
in the oncogenic progression of GIST. The amplification
of the survivin locus on 17q has been observed to be
more frequent in malignant and metastatic GIST [28] and
associated with advanced stages in neuroblastoma [29].
AML patients with XIAP amplifications had a shorter
overall survival [13]. A BIRC2/BIRC3 deletion activates
non-canonical NF-κB signaling in multiple myeloma [30],
whereas 11q22 amplification (containing cIAP locus) was
associated with earlier onset of disease in cervical cancer
[31]. In our analysis, GIST contained IAP copy number
alterations in 47.4% (Table 1). The genetic loci of XIAP
and survivin displayed more gains than losses, whereas
cIAP loci displayed more losses/LOHs suggesting that in
GIST particularly survivin and XIAP may contribute to the
transformation of cells. As we observed IAP expression
in all GIST cell lines and a majority of GIST tumors,
additional factors are most likely contributing to the high
IAP expression levels:
Physiologically, XIAP and cIAPs are inhibited
following initiation of apoptosis (SMAC/DIABLO, Omi/
HTRA2) and ER-stress (GSPT1/eRF3). These inhibitors
are physiologically sequestered to mitochondria or the
endoplasmic reticulum. The release during ER-stress
or apoptosis leads to direct binding of cIAPs and XIAP.
The binding prevents further interaction of IAPs e.g.
with caspases. [16]. Other negatively regulating proteins
are XAF-1, which binds XIAP and was found to be
downregulated in a majority of the NCI60 cancer cell
line panel, and TRAF3, which promotes the degradation
of the cIAP1/2-TRAF2-complex [16]. Tumor suppressor
p53 downregulates survivin [32] and promotes the

DISCUSSION
GISTs exhibit a unique oncogenic dependency
on mutant KIT which is underscored by the dramatic
therapeutic success of the KIT inhibitor imatinib.
Nonetheless, KIT inhibition alone is not curative as the
majority of patients eventually relapse and complete
pathological remissions are rare exceptions. While tumor
regression is commonly observed following treatment
with imatinib, vital cells are usually found in tumors that
have been resected in responding patients [4]. Improving
the apoptotic treatment response to imatinib represents
a key goal for future therapeutic concepts in GIST. In
the CML context, BCL2 inhibitors have been shown to
enhance imatinib-induced cell death [25]. Quiescence and
autophagy have been demonstrated as potential escape
mechanisms to imatinib inhibition in GIST. However,
the role of Inhibitors of Apoptosis Proteins (IAPs) has
not yet been investigated in GIST. This study is the
first to comprehensively investigate the oncogenic and
therapeutic relevance of IAPs in GIST.
IAPs promote cell survival by interacting with
apoptotic pathways and triggering cell cycle progression.
While cIAP1 and cIAP2 inhibit extrinsic apoptosis and
activate NF-κB signaling, XIAP directly inhibits effector
caspases [16]. In contrast, survivin exhibits indirect
anti-apoptotic effects by stabilizing XIAP and inhibiting
SMAC [17]. Furthermore, survivin, as part of the
chromosomal passenger complex, regulates mitosis at the
G2/M checkpoint [17].
The expression of IAPs has previously been studied
in the NCI60 cancer cell line panel. In general, cIAP1,
XIAP and survivin mRNA and protein were highly
expressed in most tumor types. Notably only 50% of cell
lines express cIAP2 mRNA and only 5% cIAP2 protein
[13]. Consistent with these findings, most GIST expressed
cIAP1, XIAP and survivin protein and mRNA while
cIAP2 mRNA levels were low. GIST primary tumors and
cell lines showed a high concordance of mRNA levels but
primary tumors exhibited slightly lower protein expression
than cell lines (Figure 1). Of note, survivin protein
levels vary substantially in cell lines depending on the
confluence of cells (Supplementary Figure S1). Differences

accompanied by decreased cell viability. However, the
sensitivity varied between cell lines and we did not find
IAP expression levels to be predictive (Figure 4). In time
course experiments, the reduction of survivin protein
occurred in parallel and not prior to apoptosis (data not
shown). These observations suggest that YM155 effects
in GIST may involve a variety of mechanisms other than
downregulation of survivin among which DNA damage
has been described by other groups [40].
We further validated SMAC-mimetic compounds,
LCL161 and TL32711, which mimic the IAP-inhibitory
interaction of SMAC and cIAPs/XIAP (Figure 5). In
phase I studies, the maximum tolerated dose was 4μM
for LCL161 and 37μM for TL32711, well within the
dose range presented in the studies herein [41]. Disease
stabilizations and even partial responses have already been
observed in clinical trials (TL32711: CRC and melanoma,
LCL161: objective responses with combinational therapy
only) [24] As observed by other groups [42, 43], cIAP
was also downregulated at low nanomolar doses in our
experiments and accompanied by downregulation of
XIAP in 3 out of 6 cell lines. Both compounds exhibited
pro-apoptotic effects at doses that seem therapeutically
achievable and this effect was more pronounced when
combined with KIT inhibitors. Notably, downregulation
of cIAP1 “alone” was not predictive of response (Figure
4B-4C) which may be explained by the high ranks of
cIAPs found in the synthetic lethality screens (Figure 1C).
Additional studies might investigate IAP-independent
predictors of response for SMAC-mimetics such as
TNF-α, which has been shown to sensitize melanoma
cells to LCL161 [43], as differential levels of TNF-α have
already been observed in GIST [44].
In summary, we found strong evidence that IAPs
may co-mediate the pro-survival signaling of oncogenic
KIT with survivin and XIAP being the most essential IAP
family members. Genetic changes involving IAP gene
loci are common in GIST and may independently add
to the apoptotic resistance of GIST. The pharmaceutical
inhibition of IAPs may improve the apoptotic response
of KIT inhibitors. Our studies therefore provide a strong
rationale for further investigation of IAP inhibitors as a
therapeutic strategy in GIST.

mitochondrial release of SMAC [21]. Genetic changes in
GIST were only observed in TP53 and SMAC/DIABLO.
Interestingly, patient 9 (Figure 1, Supplementary Table
S3 (Essen_3)) carried a SMAC/DIABLO mutation.
In addition, the patient was found to have a 17q
amplification, which resulted in highly elevated survivin
mRNA and protein levels. This patient suffered from a
highly imatinib-resistant, aggressive, metastatic GIST.
However, the low number of samples analyzed in this
study does not allow conclusions on the prognostic or
predictive relevance of these changes.
To our knowledge, the impact of oncogenic KIT
signaling on IAP regulation has yet not been studied in
GIST. AKT, which is strongly activated by oncogenic KIT,
was found to stabilize XIAP in AKT-transfected human
ovarian cancer epithelial cell line A2780S and human
embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells [33]. The specific
inhibition of PDGFRA, a receptor tyrosine kinase closely
related to KIT, induced apoptosis in a hypereosinophilic
syndrome (HES) cell line but did not influence on IAP
expression [34]. Our time course experiments do not
clearly support the hypothesis that IAPs play a role in KITregulated pro-survival signaling. Expression of survivin
and XIAP decreased upon KIT inhibition in the majority
of cell lines – however, this decrease was observed as
early as 24h and may also just represent an indirect
effect of decreased proliferation (in the case of survivin,
Figure 3). cIAP1 expression was not affected by KIT
inhibition, which underscores the results of our synthetic
lethality screen that it may not play a functional role in
the GIST cellular context. We also assessed the effect of
imatinib on IAPs in a KIT-negative cell line to exclude
the possibility of KIT-independent effects of imatinib on
IAP expression, which were not found (Supplementary
Figure S3). Additional functional studies using lentiviral
expression vectors for IAPs are needed to confirm the
effect of constitutive IAP overexpression on apoptotic
resistance in GIST.
Several biochemical inhibitors of IAPs have been
developed and are currently undergoing early clinical
investigations. Among these, the survivin transcriptional
repressor YM155 and SMAC mimetics like TL32711
and LCL161 are in advanced clinical development
[24]. We found that IAP inhibitors may improve the
apoptotic response of KIT inhibitors. YM155 has been
shown to inhibit tumor growth in vitro and in vivo in
different cancers [35]. Its steady state plasma levels
reach 17-32nM (6-day-continuous infusion) with 20fold higher concentration in mouse xenograft tumors of
prostate cancer [36, 35]. YM155 does not directly bind
the survivin promoter, but binds survivin-regulating
transcription factors [37], which may lead to additional,
unspecific effects, e.g. Mcl-1 downregulation [38]
and EGFR suppression [39]. In GIST cell lines, target
inhibition as measured by survivin mRNA and protein
levels was observed at low nanomolar doses and

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell lines, reagents and antibodies
GIST cell lines established from human GIST have
been described previously [45]. GIST-T1 was kindly
provided by Takahiro Taguchi, Kochi University, Japan
[46]. GIST cell lines GIST-T1, GIST882 and GIST
430 are imatinib-sensitive, GIST cell lines GIST48 and
GIST430-654 contain secondary KIT resistance mutations
and are resistant to imatinib. GIST 48B is a subclone of
GIST48 that still harbors the activating KIT mutation but

LMS676 and LMS04luc were established from two
leiomyosarcomas [47].
A list of cell lines, reagents and antibodies is
provided in the Supplementary Material (Supplementary
Table S3). LCL161 was kindly provided by Novartis.

(Tecan, Crailsheim, Germany). All measurements were
carried out in triplicate/quadruplicate wells for at least two
times and a representative example is shown.

Reverse transcriptase PCR and primers
Cells were harvested with RNA-Protect (Qiagen).
RNA was isolated according to manufacturer’s protocols
(RNeasy Mini Kit, Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). cDNA
synthesis and RT-PCR was done as described previously
([51], see Table 2 for primer sequences).

In vitro assays
For Sulforhodamine B (SRB) assays [48] cells were
plated at 1.000-30.000 cells/well in a 96-well flat bottom
plate and cultured for 24 hours. Cells were then incubated
with media containing inhibitors or solvent control
(DMSO). After 24-144 hours cells were fixed and stained
with SRB (0.4%, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA)
and absorption was measured with a Genion luminometer
(Tecan, Crailsheim, Germany). All measurements were
carried out in triplicate/quadruplicate wells for at least two
times and a representative example is shown.

Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR)
The cDNA synthesis and qRT-PCR were conducted
as described previously [51]. FAM-labeled probes for
KIT (HS00174029_m1), BIRC5 (survivin) isoform1
(HS00977612_mH), isoform 2 (survivin-ΔEx.3;
HS03043576_m1), isoform 3 (survivin-2B; HS03043575_
m1) were purchased from Applied Biosystems (Waltham,
MA, USA). Expression levels of the housekeeping
gene β-ACTIN (hs99999903_m1) were assessed for
normalization.

Western blotting
Cells were seeded into 6-well flat bottom plates and
grown to confluence and then incubated with inhibitors or
solvent control. Protein lysates were prepared according
to standard protocols [49]. SDS-PAGE was carried out
as previously described [50]. Proteins were transferred
to Hybond P membranes (Amersham Pharmacia
Biotech, Uppsala, Sweden). Beta-Actin was used as
a loading control. Changes in protein expression and
phosphorylation as visualized by chemiluminescence were
captured and quantified using a FUJI LAS3000 system
with Science Lab 2001 ImageGauge 4.0 software (Fujifilm
Medial Systems, Stanford, CT, USA).

Functional genetic screen of synthetic lethality
The screening method has been described previously
[19]. In GIST-T1, GIST882 and GIST430-654 cells, 11
194 genes were knocked down by lentiviral infection
with a pool of 54 020 shRNAs (approx. 5 shRNAs per
gene). After puromycin selection, cells were allowed to
proliferate independently for 6-7 weeks and treated with
imatinib (GIST882 and GIST-T1) or sunitinib (GIST430654). Genomic DNA of treated and untreated cells was
then isolated for shRNA amplification and massive
parallel sequencing. The 54020 shRNAs were then ranked
by their relative depletion from the cell pool and the
corresponding genes scored according to the rank of the
second-most depleted shRNA using the GENE-E program
(http://www.broadinstitute.org/cancer/software/GENE-E/
download.html).

Caspase Glo ® 3/7 assay
Cells were plated and cultured as for SRB assay.
After 24 – 48 hours of incubation, Caspase Glo ®
(Promega, Madison, Wisconsin, USA) was added to the
media and incubated according to manufacturer’s protocol.
Luminescence was measured with a Genion luminometer

analysis

Excellence grant of the Deutsche Krebshilfe. The project
was also in part supported by funds from the Sarkomtour
annual sarcoma bicycle race (www.sarkomtour.de).

DNA extraction, 250K Array data acquisition and
analysis of 13 GIST tumor specimen was conducted
as previously described [51]. In addition, data from
previously published GIST (SNP 6.0 array [52]) were
extracted from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO,
GSE20709) and further analyzed. This group consisted
of 18 metastatic and 13 localized GIST, the clinical stage
of 7 other GIST was unknown (Supplementary Table S2).
Out of these, 24 were KIT-mutated, 7 PDGFRA-mutated
and 6 wildtype for KIT and PDGFRA (1 unknown). Raw
data was analyzed for copy number variations in IAP loci
(cIAP1(BIRC2), cIAP2(BIRC3): 11q22; XIAP(BIRC4):
Xq25; survivin(BIRC5): 17q25), using the Chromosome
Analysis Suite 2.0.0.195 (Affymetrix) and CNAG Version
2.0 (Cancer Genomics Project, University of Tokyo,
Tokyo, Japan)).

Next-generation sequencing analysis
Whole exome capture was performed with a SeqCap
EZ Human Exome v2.0 kit (Roche NimbleGen, Madison,
WI, USA), and sequencing was carried out on a HiSeq 2000
instrument (Illumina Inc, San Diego, CA, USA). Exome
sequence alignment and variant calling were performed
with DNAnexus software (DNAnexus Inc, Mountain View,
CA, USA). Tumor-specific variants were identified based
on a minimum variant allele ratio of 20%, a minimum read
depth of 20, and absence of the variant in a matched normal
specimen. Nucleotide variants were translated, and nonsynonymous variants were identified using SIFT, PolyPhen2,
Mutation Assessor, and SNPs&GO [53].
