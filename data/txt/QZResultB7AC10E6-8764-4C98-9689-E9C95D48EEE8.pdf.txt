Abstract
Cancer stem cells (CSC) present a formidable clinical challenge
by escaping therapeutic intervention and seeding tumors through
processes that remain incompletely understood. Here, we describe
small subpopulations of pancreatic cancer cells with high intrinsic
Wnt activity (Wnthigh) that possess properties indicative of CSCs,
including drug resistance and tumor-initiating capacity, whereas
cell populations with negligible Wnt activity (Wntlow) preferentially express markers of differentiation. Spontaneous response
to extrinsic Wnt signals induces signaling networks comprising
ERK1/2 and epithelial–mesenchymal transition that subsequently
confer cancer stemness traits to susceptible cells. Wnt enhancer

R-Spondin 2 (RSPO2) seems to play a prominent upstream role in
regulating this interplay. In this context, Wnthigh cells were more
likely to give rise to Wnthigh progeny, tended to be more metastatic,
and revealed higher levels of RSPO2 expression. Our studies reveal
adaptive aspects of pancreatic cancer stemness arising from driver
populations of CSCs that misappropriate functional and responsive elements of archetypical self-renewal pathways. Blocking such
stemness-promoting pathways in conjunction with established
chemotherapy could provide means to disrupt dynamic CSC
process and present novel therapeutic targets and strategies. Cancer

Introduction

It is known that cancer stemness is not predeﬁned, but rather a
ﬂuent condition that can be modiﬁed in susceptible cells by
contextual signals. For example, cancer stem–like traits such as
epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT), a well-conserved and
critical process in embryonic development (6), can be reactivated
in adult tissue cells, especially cancer cells (7).
Various factors can provide these signals, e.g., members of
self-renewal pathways such as TGFb, Hedgehog, or Wnt (8).
Canonical Wnt signaling has been widely investigated because
driver mutations in core elements of the pathway, particularly
in APC and b-catenin, were found in colorectal and liver cancers
(9, 10). In "classical" canonical Wnt signaling, the transcriptional regulator b-catenin remains under strict control of the
destruction complex consisting of APC, AXIN2, and GSK3b.
Upon binding of Wnt ligands to LRP5/6 and Frizzled coreceptors, b-catenin escapes its degradation, translocates to the
nucleus, and acts as transcription factor at Tcf/Lef-binding sites
(11). Recently, it has been shown that Wnt activation can be
markedly enhanced by simultaneous ligand–receptor binding
of R-Spondins to LGR4, 5, or 6 (12).
Remarkably, even in cancers with activating b-catenin mutations, heterogeneous Wnt signaling activities can be encountered,
and this so-called "b-catenin paradox" phenomenon might be
indicative of cancer stemness trait regulation (13).
Most PDACs do not harbor driver mutations in the canonical
Wnt signaling pathway, and thus its involvement in regulating
CSC behavior in PDAC is less clear. However, very recent evidence
suggests that Wnt signaling might be necessary for pancreatic
carcinogenesis and that this activation is most likely conveyed by
ligand–receptor interactions (14). Moreover, monoclonal antibody inhibition of Wnt signaling was shown to improve antitumor treatment in an orthotopic mouse model that suggests that

Adaptive phenotypic and functional diversity is characteristic
of tumor survival. Apart from differences between tumor types,
solid cancers also display conspicuous heterogeneities with
(often dynamic) distinct biologic properties within the same
tumor (1, 2). The concept of cancer stem cells (CSC) has been
formulated to account for various levels of differentiation, with
the least differentiated and tumor-propagating CSC at the apex
of the hierarchy that must be eradicated to achieve durable cure
(3). Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is reported to
belong to the CSC-organized set of solid tumors and, indeed, is
encountered clinically as an aggressive tumor type associated
with drug resistance, formation of remote metastasis, and an
overall dismal prognosis despite increased research efforts in
recent years (4, 5).

certain processes require ligand-mediated canonical Wnt signaling in pancreatic cancer (15).
On the basis of these emerging ﬁndings, we hypothesized that
microenvironmental cues might modify canonical Wnt signaling
in PDAC cells and hence regulate cancer stemness potential in
plastic pancreatic CSCs.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture
Cell lines were obtained from the ATCC or established at The
University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center and kindly
provided by Dr. Dominic Fan (L3.6pl) or Dr. Thiru Arumugam
[MDA-Patx1 (Patx1), ref. 16]. Cells were grown as described
before at 37 C in MEM-a medium supplemented with 10% FBS,
1% penicillin/streptomycin, 100 nmol/L L-glutamine, 1 essential amino acid solution, and 1 MEM Vitamins (all from Gibco/
Life Technologies; ref. 17). Cell lines (AsPC1 and L3.6pl) were
authenticated within 6 months prior to use at the MDACC Cancer
Center Support Grant Characterized Cell Line Core (funded by NCI
# CA 16672) by short tandem repeat ﬁngerprinting.
For further in vitro experiments, tumor xenografts were mechanically minced and then incubated at 37 C with an enzyme blend
(Matrase; InGeneron) for 30 minutes, washed with full medium,
and seeded into cell culture dishes. Medium was changed after 48
hours.

described morphologies were designated as mixed (see also
Supplementary Fig. S2F).
Recombinant proteins and small-molecule inhibitors
Recombinant human proteins were purchased from the
indicated suppliers: Wnt3a and TRAIL (R&D Systems), and
RSPO2 (Peprotech). The small-molecule inhibitors IWR1endo and IWR2 were purchased from ReagentsDirect, and
UO126 from EMD Millipore Chemicals. Gemcitabine was
provided by the general institutional pharmacy and supplied
by Eli Lilly.
Reverse-phase protein analysis
Reverse-phase protein analysis (RPPA) was carried out as
described before by the Functional Proteomics RPPA Core Facility
of MD Anderson Cancer Center (19). Samples subjected to the
assay were sorted into GFPhigh/low populations, subsequently
seeded into 6-well plates, and harvested 24 hours later according
to the core facility's instructions. See full datasets in Supplementary Table S1.

CSC spheroid culture and assay
As described elsewhere (4), cells were trypsinized, washed
with PBS, and seeded into low-attachment plates (Corning)
at clonal density (1,000 cells/mL) in CSC sphere-medium
[MEM-a medium supplemented with 1 B27 (Gibco), 100
nmol/L L-Glutamine, 1% penicillin/streptomycin, and EGF (10
ng/mL)/FGF (20 ng/mL; both from Sigma)]. For sphere-formation ability (SFA) experiments, 500 or 1,000 cells were
seeded in 100 mL of CSC medium complemented with 1%
methylcellulose (Sigma) to prevent cell–cell aggregations into
ultra-low-attachment 96-well plates. CSC medium with and
without methylcellulose was changed every 3 to 4 days. To
generate spheres of a higher generation, spheres were collected
in a tube by gravitation, washed with PBS, trypsinized, washed
with PBS again, and seeded as described above. Additional
small-molecule inhibitors, growth factors, or morphogens were
added to SFA experiments as indicated in the text. Spheres were
deﬁned as having a diameter greater than 75 mm and were
counted after 10 to 12 days of culture. Otherwise, diameters are
indicated in the text.

Lentiviral and luciferase reporter assays
Lentiviral production was carried out following the AddGene
online protocol. Brieﬂy, 1.5  106 HEK293T helper cells were
transfected at a ratio of 1:4:5 with envelope plasmid pCMV-VSVG
(AddGene Plasmid no. 8454), packaging plasmid pCMV-dR8.2
(AddGene Plasmid no. 8455), and 7TGC (AddGene Plasmid
#24304) with FuGeneHD (Roche) in a 60-mm dish. After overnight incubation, medium was changed and lentiviral soup was
generated for 48 hours. Before use, the lentivirus-containing
supernatant was ﬁltered through a 0.45-mm ﬁlter and added to
the cell cultures or stored at 80 C until further use. Cells were
then washed with PBS, expanded, and sorted for equal mCherry
intensities to guarantee comparable integration levels of the
plasmid.
For transient transfections in reporter assays, 5.0  104 cells
were transfected with 500 ng inducible ﬁreﬂy luciferase expressing either SuperTOP or SuperFOP vector (AddGene Plasmids
#12456 and #12457) and cotransfected with constitutively
Renilla luciferase expressing normalization control vector pRLTK (Promega) at a ratio of 50:1. Cells were then cultured or
stimulated for 24 hours, lysed with passive lysis buffer, and ﬁreﬂy
and Renilla luciferase activity was monitored with the Dual
Luciferase Reporter Assay System (Promega) according to the
manufacturer's instructions. All experiments were performed in
triplicates.

Holoclone culture
Holoclone assays were performed as described by Qin and
colleagues (18) with minor modiﬁcations. In summary, 500
single cells were seeded in 3 mL of complete culture medium
into 6-well plates and incubated at 37 C for approximately 10
days. Colonies with approximately 50 cells or more were
described as holoclones and then counted with a ﬂuorescent
microscope in the case of 7TGC-transduced cell cultures and after
staining with crystal violet. In experiments where we compared
different morphologic growth patterns of GFPhigh and GFPlow
cultures, holoclones with tightly packed colonies were called
"epithelial," those with loosely accumulated colonies were "mesenchymal," and colonies that did not ﬁt either of the above-

In vivo xenograft experiments
Mouse experiments were performed in accordance with the
Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) at MD
Anderson. Immunocompromised age-matched male 5- to 6week-old, athymic, nu/nu, Balb/c mice were purchased from an
institutional breeder colony and kept at 24 C and in sterile
conditions with water and food ad libitum. As indicated, different
dilutions of cells in 50 mL PBS were subcutaneously injected in the
ﬂank via a 27G-needle. For orthotopic tumor implantations, the
mice were anesthetized with continuous sevoﬂurane (2.5 L/min)
and oxygen inhalation; after opening the abdominal cavity with a
lateral incision over the spleen, the tail of the pancreas was
mobilized, injected with 50 mL tumor cell suspension in PBS,

relocated, and the wound was closed with single suture (Vicryl) of
the peritoneum and wound clips on the skin. Tumor growth was
controlled and measured regularly (subcutaneous model), and
mice were checked for their vital status and weight. Tumor volume
was calculated by the following formula: mm3 ¼ (width  width
 length)/2 (mm). All mice were sacriﬁced when their tumor
volumes reached high tumor burdens according to the IACUC
protocol or at the end of the experiment. Subsequently, tumor
parts that were selected for further in vitro cell culture experiments
were processed as described above. For further experiments,
fragments of the tumors were either ﬁxed in 4% paraformaldehyde for histologic analyses or frozen in liquid nitrogen for
molecular analyses.
Mouse models and assessment of primary murine pancreatic
cancer cells
Murine tumor cells were isolated from primary pancreatic
tumors by dissection, mincing, and subsequent collagenase
type V digestion (1 mg/mL, Sigma Aldrich) for 30 minutes at
37 C. Cells were ﬁltered through a 100 mm nylon mesh, washed
twice with PBS, and cultured in DMEM with 10% FBS and 1%
PS (penicillin/streptomycin) all reagents from Gibco Invitrogen. Isolated pancreatic tumor cells from a p48Cre;LSLKrasG12D/þ (KC-428) or a p48Cretg/þ;LSL-KrasG12D/þ;p53lox/lox
(KPC-1050) were assessed for CSC characteristics. Cells were
trypsinized, washed with ﬂow buffer, and blocked for 15
minutes on ice with Fcblock (Anti-Mouse CD16/CD32 Puriﬁed; eBioscience). After washing, cells were stained with CD24APC (1:500, 0.4 mg/mL, #17-0242; eBioscience) and CD44FITC (1:200, 2.5 mg/mL, #11-0441; eBioscience) and appropriate anti-rat IgG-FITC/-APC controls (eBioscience) for 40 minutes on ice in the dark. Cells were washed twice with ﬂow buffer
low
and sorted in a CD24/CD44 and a CD24/CD44high cell
population (FACSAria III; BD Biosciences) and collected in
ice-cold ﬂow buffer for RNA isolation.
RNA isolation was performed according to manufacturer's
instructions with the RNeasy Plus Mini Kit from Qiagen. Afterwards, 1 mg RNA was reverse-transcribed with the RevertAid First
Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit from Thermo Scientiﬁc.
Gene expression was analyzed with quantitative real-time
PCR (qRT-PCR) in the LightCycler LC480 (Roche) and carried
out with 40 ng complementary DNA, 500 nmol/L forward
and reverse primer, and SYBR Green Master Mix (Roche) in
a ﬁnal volume of 20 mL. The following primer pairs (50 !
30 orientation) were used according to standard PCR protocol
(Supplementary Table S2).
siRNA experiments
siRNA knockdown experiments were carried out as follows:
cells were seeded into 24-well plates at about 50% conﬂuence in
MEM-a supplemented with 10% FBS only. On the next day, the
medium was changed and according to the manufacturer's
instruction, a mix of 50 to 100 nmol/L siRNA and INTERFERin
(Polyplus Transfection) at a ratio of 1:1 was added dropwise. The
medium was again changed on the following day. For whole cell
lysates, cells were harvested 72 hours after transfection. FACS
analysis or cell seeding for subsequent SFA was carried out on the
same day. The following siRNAs were used in this study: SignalSilence b-catenin siRNA I (#6225) and SignalSilence p44/42
MAPK (ERK1/2) siRNA (#6560) both from Cell Signaling Technology, Inc.

Immunohistochemistry and immunoﬂuorescence
PFA-ﬁxed and parafﬁn-embedded tissue sections underwent
antigen retrieval in sodium citrate buffer (pH 6.0) at boiling
temperature for 20 minutes. After cooling down, sections were
washed in TBS plus 0.025% Triton X-100, blocked in 10% goat
serum, and incubated with primary antibody solutions at 4 C
overnight. After washing, slides were directly incubated with
Alexa-Fluor–conjugated secondary antibody solution at room
temperature for 1.5 hours in the dark. Immunoﬂuorescent
slides were counterstained with 40 ,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole
(DAPI) and then mounted in Fluorescence Mounting Medium
(Dako). IHC sections were stained using the VECTASTAIN Elite
ABC Kit (Universal) according to the manufacturer's instructions (Vector Laboratories). For primary goat antibodies, we
used a horseradish peroxidase–conjugated anti-goat secondary
antibody solution.
mRNA expression analysis
For total RNA extraction, cells were homogenized with TRIzol (Invitrogen). Phase separation was performed by the addition of chloroform and subsequent centrifugation steps. Aqueous phase of samples was collected and RNA precipitated by
isopropyl alcohol. After washing, RNA was redissolved in
DEPC-treated water, and RNA quality and quantity were measured with a Nanodrop ND-1000 Spectrophotometer (Thermo
Scientiﬁc). For cDNA synthesis, the iScript Reverse Transcription Supermix (Bio-Rad) was used according to the manufacturer's protocol, and the reaction mix was incubated in a
thermal cycler (Bio-Rad MyIQ Single-Color RT-PCR Detection
System iCycler) with the following protocol: priming (5 minutes at 25 C), reverse transcription (30 minutes at 42 C), and
reverse transcription inactivation (5 minutes at 85 C). qRT-PCR
was performed using iQ SYBR Green Supermix (Bio-Rad)
according to the following protocol: initial denaturation and
enzyme activation (1 cycle at 95 C for 3 minutes), denaturing
(40 cycles at 95 C for 15 seconds) with annealing and extension (40 cycles at 55 C for 30 seconds), and melting curve (1
cycle at 55–95 C in 5 C increments for 30 seconds). Ct was
measured in absolute quantiﬁcation and compared with
GAPDH as housekeeping gene. Human-speciﬁc primers were
used (Supplementary Table S3).
Flow cytometry
For Wnt activity, ﬂow cytometry was performed on trypsindetached 7TGC cultures or freshly digested tumor tissues from in
vivo studies. After trypsinization/digestion, cells were washed with
and analyzed in ﬂow buffer (1x PBS with 2% FBS, 4 C). Cells were
stringently gated on viable cells with the same background intensity of mCherry. Then, Wnt activity correlating with GFP levels was
monitored on the LSRFortessa cell analyzer (BD Biosciences).
Nontransduced cells were used as negative controls for both
mCherry and GFP levels. FACS sorting of GFPhigh or GFPlow
subpopulations was carried out accordingly on the Inﬂux cell
sorter (BD Biosciences).
Flow cytometric analysis of cell surface markers was carried out
on cells or spheroids cultures after dissociation with Versene
Solution (Invitrogen). Cells were dissociated, washed, counted,
and resuspended at a density of 1 to 2  105 cells/100 mL in ﬂow
buffer. Then, cells were stained with the respective antibody
concentrations according to the manufacturer's recommendations for 30 minutes on ice. After washing, cells were analyzed

system. As expected and previously reported (20), Wnt signaling activity levels were rather low, especially relative to b-catenin–mutated cell line HepG2 (Fig. 1A). Interestingly, STF levels
of the different pancreatic cancer cell lines varied signiﬁcantly.
Heterogeneous expression of the Wnt transcription factor
b-catenin was observed in human pancreatic cancer tissue (The
Human Protein Atlas; refs. 21, 22) as well as in xenografts from
our own study, with most of the b-catenin being membrane
bound and occurring infrequently in cytoplasmic/nuclear locations (Fig. 1B). To further investigate such intratumoral heterogeneities and because the STF reporter system does not account
for individual cell variability of Wnt activation, we used a
lentiviral GFP-coupled Wnt reporter construct (23) that yields
expression of mCherry constitutively but expression of GFP
only in cells with activated Wnt/b-catenin signaling (Fig. 1C
and Supplementary Fig. S1A). In accordance with the earlier
STF results, more than 85% of the HepG2 cells displayed high
levels of Wnt activity, whereas in untreated pancreatic cancer

on the LSRFortesa cell analyzer. For cell cycle experiments, cells
were trypsinized, washed, and stored in 70% EtOH at 4 C for at
least 24 hours. Cells were then washed and stained with Propidium Iodide or DAPI for 30 minutes at 37 C, washed again, and
analyzed; data were evaluated with FlowJo 7.6 software.
Statistical analyses
Results are expressed as the mean  SEM. All statistical comparisons were made with a standard t test, using biostatistics
software from GraphPad Prism. The criteria for signiﬁcance were
P < 0.05 ( ), P < 0.01 ( ), and P < 0.001 ( ) for all comparisons.

cell lines, 0.5% to 3.5% of cells were GFP/Wnthigh at baseline
(Fig. 1D).
For further detailed analysis, we serially enriched for the 5% of
pancreatic cancer cells with the highest (GFPhigh) and lowest
(GFPlow) expression of GFP, respectively (Fig. 1E and Supplementary Fig. S1B). These two subpopulations differed signiﬁcantly in their GFP expression (Fig. 1F). To rule out false-positive
background activity in our experimental system, we performed
immunoﬂuorescent staining for b-catenin (Fig. 1G). Active Wnt
signaling in the GFPhigh population was conﬁrmed by a high
percentage of nuclear b-catenin (white arrowheads), whereas
GFPlow pancreatic cancer cells were mostly negative for nuclear
b-catenin and high in membrane-bound b-catenin. Also, comparative Western blotting in these subsets corroborated Wnt
activation in GFPhigh cells with activating phosphorylation of the
S552 site (Supplementary Fig. S1C), high intracellular b-catenin,
and upregulated Wnt receptors LRP5/6 (Supplementary Fig.
S1D). In contrast, the pancreatic ductal differentiation marker
cytokeratin 19 was highly present in GFPlow cells and almost

Consistent with the divergent Wnt/GFP status results, SFA—a

Fig. S2A). Strikingly, quantitative RT-PCR analysis revealed that
stemness-associated genes (e.g., SNAI1, NANOG, ZEB1) and
Wnt target genes/enhancers (AXIN2, LGR5, RSPO2) had higher
expression in GFPhigh compared with GFPlow cells (Fig. 2B).
Furthermore, we observed dramatic morphologic dissimilarities

dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) cultures (Fig. 2C).
As expected, the GFPlow cells revealed epithelial cell clusters and
tight sphere structures resembling the parental L3.6pl cell line
(top; Supplementary Fig. S2B). In contrast, the GFPhigh cells
formed elongated shapes (2D) with less cell–cell contact as well
as grape-like features (3D), which are characteristic of mesenchymal PDAC cell types (Fig. 2C, Supplementary Figs. S2C and S1F).
These effects were partially reversed when Wnt signaling was
blocked by IWR1-endo, a small-molecule inhibitor of Wnt
response, in pancreatic cancer cells in sphere culture (Supplementary Fig. S2D; ref. 24).
Western blot analysis revealed the upregulation of mesenchymal marker vimentin and transcription factors (SNAIL and Zeb1)
in GFPhigh cells compared with GFPlow cells (Fig. 2D) and the
downregulation of epithelial markers E-cadherin (Supplementary
Fig. S1E). Because EMT is reported to be linked to cancer stemness
(7), we sought to verify these results in a primary PDAC cell line
(Patx1) and also observed that typical EMT markers were differentially expressed. Appreciably higher expression of mesenchymal markers (Snail, vimentin, Zeb1) in GFPhigh cells and simultaneous slightly lower expression of epithelial markers (aE-catenin, total b-catenin) hinted toward partially EMT-transformed,
metaplastic states of these cell populations (Fig. 2E; ref. 25).
When these cell subsets were seeded at clonal density, holoclone
formation differed in number (Fig. 2F), as did their morphology,
to an even more convincing degree (Fig. 2G, Supplementary
Fig. S2E and S2F). Interestingly, GFPlow-derived holoclones essentially consisted of GFPlow-epithelial cell colonies, whereas GFPhigh
-derived holoclones consisted of 46% to 60% epithelial GFPlow
colonies, 19% to 25% mesenchymal GFPhigh colonies, and 21%
to 29% mixed colonies with intermittent GFPhigh cells. These
results further corroborated the observation that different intrinsic Wnt activation levels lead to distinct biologic properties in
pancreatic cancer cells.
Last, we determined whether GFPhigh and GFPlow cells differed
in their respective proliferation capacities. Here, we found that the
GFPlow subpopulation was slightly enriched for cells in G2 phase
(Supplementary Fig. S2G); moreover, immunoﬂuorescent costaining for GFP and the proliferation marker Ki67 in an L3.6pl7TGC xenograft revealed little Ki67 and GFP coexpression (Fig.
2H). These results might hint toward a less proliferative, more
quiescent state—EMT-associated growth arrest (1)—in GFPhigh
cells. In support of this, comparative cell cycle analysis of CSCenriched tumor spheres and differentiated 2D culture showed that
spheres rested in a mostly dormant state in G0–G1 phase (Supplementary Fig. S2H).
Certain Wnt/GFPhigh populations possess increased
tumorigenic and metastatic potential
Next, we sought to determine whether differences in intrinsic
Wnt activation level in PDAC cells lead to altered tumorigenic
potential. Epithelial L3.6pl and mesenchymal AsPC1 ﬂuorescent
reporter lines were enriched into GFPhigh and GFPlow subpopulations that were then subcutaneously implanted into male athymic
nu/nu mice at different dilutions. In the respective groups that
formed tumors at the lowest concentrations, the GFPhigh groups
formed tumors earlier (Fig. 3A). Also, tumor volumes increased
signiﬁcantly faster in the GFPhigh groups (Fig. 3B). These differences between the GFPhigh and GFPlow groups were considerably
more drastic in the epithelial cell line L3.6pl than in the mesenchymal cell line AsPC1. Although AsPC1GFP-high cells had a

1888 Cancer Res; 75(9) May 1, 2015

slightly higher tumor-initiating cell (TIC) index than
AsPC1GFP-low cells as calculated by extreme limited dilution
analysis (26), this difference was not signiﬁcant; in contrast,
L3.6plGFP-high cells were signiﬁcantly enriched in TICs compared
with L3.6plGFP-low cells (Fig. 3C).
Because subcutaneous mouse models do not fully recapitulate
the organ microenvironment, we sought to further evaluate how
the respective subpopulations might react in an orthotopic context. For that purpose, we again enriched for L3.6plGFP-high or
L3.6plGFP-low cells and implanted 100,000 cells into the tail of the
pancreas of male athymic nu/nu mice. All of the implanted cells
formed tumors; however, the volumes were signiﬁcantly larger in
the GFPhigh population (Fig. 3D). From this ﬁrst generation of
orthotopic tumors, we isolated cells and sorted for the GFPhigh
cells from GFPhigh-derived tumors (Nos. 126-128) and GFPlow
cells from GFPlow tumors (Nos. 132-134) and subsequently
implanted them into second-generation recipients (Fig. 3E). Here,
again, tumors arose from all injections, but earlier tumor onset
(Supplementary Fig. S3A) and markedly greater tumor volumes
were seen in GFPhigh-derived tumors (Fig. 3D and F). Histologically, the arising tumors resembled solid, nodular, and undifferentiated PDACs (Fig. 3G, left).
IHC GFP staining revealed a substantially higher number of
GFPhigh cells in the GFPhigh-derived tumors than in the GFPlow
-derived tumors; nevertheless, we also detected a small number of
GFPhigh cells in GFPlow tumors, which suggests that intrinsic
stimuli or microenvironmental signals can reactivate Wnt signaling in these cells. The difference in GFPhigh cells between the two
groups became even more pronounced in the second-generation
tumors, which might imply that GFPhigh cells are more likely to
derive from GFPhigh precursors (Fig. 3G, right). Intriguingly, we
also detected isolated metastases in GFPhigh tumors (e.g., in the
spleen and peritoneum; Fig. 3H and Supplementary Fig. S3B).
Moreover, metastasis-derived cells yielded higher numbers of
GFPhigh cells and spheres with mesenchymal morphology in SFA
experiments than did primary tumor-derived cells (Supplementary Fig. S3C–S3E). Finally, metastasis-derived PDAC cells usually
had greater sphere-forming ability than primary tumor cells,
conﬁrming that SFA in our model system is a valid in vitro
surrogate marker for anoikis-resistant growth, tumorigenesis, and
metastatic ability.
Highly tumorigenic murine pancreatic CSCs overexpress Wnt
enhancer genes
To determine the signiﬁcance of Wnt enhancer genes in primary
tumor cells, we used two different genetic mouse models, low
tumorigenic KC-428 and high tumorigenic KPC-1050. Both lines
were sorted by FACS differing in their CSC marker proﬁle into
CD24/CD44high and CD24/CD44low tumor cells (Fig. 4A).
Although Rspo2 was slightly higher expressed in KC-428 CSCs,
the expression pattern of further Wnt and CSC markers was not
consistent (Fig. 4B). However, in the highly tumorigenic KPC1050, we found signiﬁcantly higher levels of Rspo2, Lgr5, Axin2,
and Snail, suggesting an active role of RSPO2-enhanced Wnt
signaling in KPC-1050–derived CSCs (Fig. 4C).
GFPhigh PDAC cells are chemoresistant and can be selectively
enriched by chemotherapy
A clinically critical hallmark of cancer, especially CSCs, is intrinsic or acquired drug resistance (27). To explore this with regard to
Wnt activation in PDAC, we implanted randomized L3.6pl

orthotopic xenografts into two groups with one control group
(Co1 and Co2) and one gemcitabine-treated group (GEM1 and
GEM2), respectively (Fig. 4D). The resultant tumors were excised
and subsequently either stained for GFP or digested and subjected
to ﬂow cytometric analysis (Fig. 4E). Gemcitabine treatment drastically increased the numbers of GFPhigh cells 3.4- to 15.5-fold in
vivo (Supplementary Fig. S4A). Next, we tested whether gemcitabine had similar effects in vitro. Exposure of the tumor cells to
gemcitabine for 72 hours increased the relative number of GFPhigh
cells 1.7- to 6.7-fold (Supplementary Fig. S4B). As proof of principle, we additionally treated the primary cell line Patx1 with IWR1endo alone or in combination with gemcitabine. IWR1-endo
reduced baseline GFP levels and prevented gemcitabine-induced
enrichment of GFPhigh Patx1 cells, which could imply that the
observed effect might not only be an enrichment of intrinsically
Wnthigh cells, but also an escape mechanism from drug-induced
cell death by autocrine or paracrine Wnt induction (Supplementary
Fig. S4C). Moreover, the observations that gemcitabine treatment

www.aacrjournals.org

in vitro increases gene expression levels of the Wnt-enhancing
ligand RSPO2, the EMT-transcription factor SNAI1, and the Wnt
target gene TCF4, especially in CSC-containing spheres, support
this idea (Supplementary Fig. S4D).
Tumor spheres seemed to display an intrinsically higher
Wnt activation as evidenced by elevated Wnt target gene expression such as AXIN2 (Supplementary Fig. S4E and S4F). Furthermore, freshly sorted GFPhigh cells displayed signiﬁcantly higher
resistance to gemcitabine (Fig. 4F) and, hence, a higher IC50 value
(15.12 ng/mL vs. 6.15 ng/mL) in the chemosensitive cell line
L3.6pl (Supplementary Fig. S4G). PDAC cells derived from
GFPhigh ﬁrst- or second-generation orthotopic xenografts displayed an inherently greater drug resistance to gemcitabine
(Fig. 4G and Supplementary Fig. S4H) as well as to the novel
antitumor and chemopreventive drug TRAIL (Supplementary Fig.
S4H; ref. 28). Finally, TRAIL resistance could also be seen in
freshly sorted GFPhigh PDAC cells compared with a more sensitive
GFPlow counterpart from the same cell pool (Fig. 4H).

Wnt-responsive PDAC cells are susceptible to RSPO2-induced
signaling enhancement
To gain a better understanding of the underlying responses of
PDAC cells to extrinsic Wnt ligands and modiﬁers such as
members of the R-Spondin family, we subjected different cell
lines to recombinant human (rh) Wnt3a, rhRSPO2, or a combination thereof. As reported before (29), PDAC cells can be
grouped into low responders (e.g., AsPC1, Patx1) or high
responders (e.g., BxPC3, L3.6pl); however, that study only
focused on induction of Wnt signaling by treatments with
CHIR990221 or Wnt3-conditioned media. According to recent
The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) data, the RSPO2 gene copy
number was the only Wnt enhancer upregulated in PDAC
compared with normal pancreas (Supplementary Fig. S5A).
Although not statistically signiﬁcant, RSPO2 copy numbers in
the same dataset tended to be higher in advanced tumor and
nodal stages (Supplementary Fig. S5B). N1 stages also tended
to express higher RSPO2 protein levels in tissue microarray
(TMA) studies compared with N0 stages (Supplementary

1890 Cancer Res; 75(9) May 1, 2015

Fig. S5C and Supplementary Table S5). Conversely, it was recently reported that the RSPO2–LGR5 axis suppresses tumor growth in
colorectal cancer, a surprising ﬁnding given the highly Wntdependent nature of this cancer type (30). We observed that
treatment with RSPO2 alone or in combination with Wnt3a had
very small effects on Wnt stimuli in low-responder cells, whereas
high-responders reacted rapidly to Wnt3a, RSPO2, and boldly to
their combination (Fig. 5A and Supplementary Fig. S6A). To
further decipher this responsiveness, we sorted GFPlow,
GFPmiddle, and GFPhigh fractions and subsequently exposed them
to either rhWnt3a or rhRSPO2 (Fig. 5B). Overall, GFPmiddle PDAC
cells seemed prone to each of the two stimuli, whereas GFPlow cells
reacted slightly more to rhRSPO2 and GFPhigh cells showed only
limited increases in GFP levels, presumably due to their high
baseline GFP levels (Fig. 5B and C).
As expected, sphere-formation capacity correlated with GFP
levels (Fig. 5D). Similar to our observations in GFPlow-derived
tumor xenografts, spheres of GFPlow PDAC cells also rarely harbored GFPhigh cells (Fig. 5D, white arrowhead). This led to the

assumption that these cells themselves or bystander PDAC cells
might produce Wnt ligands. It also indicated a certain grade of
Wnt plasticity for high responders with plastic stemness potential.
A closer examination of this behavior in high versus low responders uncovered that high responders rapidly react to RSPO2/
Wnt3a stimuli and can be serially enriched, but revert back to a
mostly GFPlow phenotype in regular 2D cell culture. Sphere
culture or passaging in vivo preserves higher GFP expression,
suggesting that these conditions offer a more adequate microenvironment for Wnt-positivity and that Wnthigh cells are more likely
to produce Wnthigh offspring (Fig. 5E, top). In contrast, low
responders only show modest responses to RSPO2/Wnt3a stimuli, but consistently maintain high GFP levels in adherent and
sphere conditions as well as in vivo (Fig. 5E, bottom). Single
GFPhigh-derived spheres revealed then that high responders often
harbored a small subset of GFPhigh cells, leading to the notion that
Wnt levels might vary in these tumorspheres, whereas lowresponder tumorspheres remained GFPhigh throughout representing less Wnt plasticity here (Fig. 5F). These results led us to

www.aacrjournals.org

hypothesize that additional pathway regulations might be necessary to explain this phenomenon.
Wnt activation stimulates downstream ERK1/2 and EMT
The interplay/crosstalk of canonical Wnt and ERK1/2 pathways
has been described as diverse in different organ systems, e.g.,
increased ERK1/2 signaling seems to inhibit Wnt in melanoma,
whereas aberrant activation of Wnt/b-catenin in colorectal cancer
stimulates downstream ERK1/2 (31–33). Recent data show concomitant activation of Wnt and ERK1/2 during pancreatic tumorigenesis (34). Accordingly, we wanted to investigate whether such
a connection existed in our system. In Western blot analysis, we
detected a positive correlation between Wnt and ERK activation in
high-responder PDAC cell lines (Fig. 6A and Supplementary Fig.
S6B). Moreover, murine CD24/CD44high CSCs tended to overexpress nuclear b-catenin and (p)-ERK corroborating their positive correlation (Supplementary Fig. S6C). To further understand
these complex pathway interactions, we carried out RPPA, which
conﬁrmed distinctive ERK1/2 (MAPK; blue frame) activities as

well as EMT phenotype in GFPhigh versus GFPlow PDAC cells (Fig.
6B). Interestingly, additional pathways that can crosstalk with
Wnt, such as AKT or p38, did not have concurrent regulation of
GFPlow/high pairs in the different cell lines.
Next, we sought to comprehensively investigate longer-term
effects of Wnt/ERK manipulation on GFPhigh as well as GFPlow
cells in high and low Wnt-responder PDAC cells. For that
purpose, we treated GFPlow subsets with RSPO2/Wnt3a and
GFPhigh subsets (in which we predicted inherently higher Wnt
and ERK levels) with RSPO2/Wnt3a, ERK inhibitor UO126, or
Wnt inhibitor IWP2 for 3 days. As expected, RSPO2/Wnt3a had
only modest effects on GFPlow subsets of low responders, with a
minor Dvl2 increase in AsPC1 and p-LRP6 increase in Patx1
pointing toward a somewhat functional Wnt cascade (Fig. 6C).
GFPhigh subsets revealed substantial differences in GFP levels
and higher p-LRP6/LRP6 ratios compared with GFPlow PDAC
subsets and SNAIL upregulation upon RSPO2/Wnt3a stimulation. UO126 treatment showed only modest responses, most

apparent in Zeb1 downregulation. IWP2 in contrast reduced
robustly p-LRP6, LRP5/6, Dvl2, SNAIL, and p-ERK levels (Fig.
6C). The high-responder cell line L3.6pl reacted with elevated
levels of p-LRP6/LRP6 ratios, Dvl2 phosphorylation, SNAIL
induction, and p-ERK activation upon RSpo2/Wnt3a stimulation, regardless of GFP status (Fig. 6D). Remarkably, UO126 as
well as IWP2 treatment reduced p-ERK and Zeb1 levels and
increased E-cadherin levels, suggesting that ERK is indeed
subordinated to canonical Wnt and Zeb1 downstream to its
control (Fig. 6D). UO126 led to increased Wnt-activating
effects of RSPO2 in a dose-dependent manner and hence hints
toward a negative-feedback loop of p-ERK on LGR6 in PDAC
(Supplementary Fig. S6D and S6E).
In vivo, p-ERK was predominantly expressed in areas of
the invasive front and coincided there with a higher number of
GFPhigh cells (Fig. 6E). Although Western blot analysis of lowresponder PDAC cells did not reveal the changes seen in high
responders, GFPhigh cells altered their phenotypic appearance

Susceptibility to RSPO2 Deﬁnes Pancreatic Cancer Stem Cells

we found, as expected, that GFPhigh PDAC cell–derived tumors
had less membrane-bound and more cytoplasmic b-catenin
expression than GFPlow PDAC cell–derived tumors and that this
difference was greater in second-generation tumors (Fig. 7A).
Correspondingly, we found a signiﬁcantly higher expression of
RSPO2 in these tumors. RSPO2 expression was also detectable in
sections of human pancreatic cancers (Supplementary Fig. S7B)
and seemed to correlate with Zeb1 expression in TMA datasets
(Supplementary Fig. S7C and Supplementary Table S5). Stimulation with extrinsically added RSPO2 signiﬁcantly increased
sphere-forming ability in different PDAC cell lines (Fig. 7B),
suggesting that CSCs especially might be susceptible to RSPO2
stimulation. This effect could be impeded by the use of a blocking
antibody against RSPO2 in a similar assay, but blockage of
RSPO2 had only minimal effects on cell viability (Supplementary
Fig. S7D and S7E). Encouraged by this ﬁnding, we stimulated the
high-responder cell line L3.6pl with RSPO2 overnight, sorted the
5% GFPhigh and 5% GFPlow subpopulations with the aim to
enrich for the best and worst RSPO2 responders, respectively,
and then determined their sphere-forming ability. Intriguingly,
high RSPO2 responsiveness conferred signiﬁcantly improved
sphere-forming capacity in the same cell line (Fig. 7C). This
conﬁrms that RSPO2 plays a major role in regulating cancer
stemness events in susceptible PDAC cells. We further analyzed
RSPO2 expression in vivo and found in IHC sections high expressions in certain areas of the pancreas and the invasive front. The
latter correlated with a low frequency of membrane-bound

drastically upon constant Wnt or ERK inhibition (Fig. 6F). In line
with the downregulation of EMT transcription factors Zeb1 (by
UO126 treatment) or SNAIL (by IWP2 treatment), Patx1 became
more epithelial like in morphology whereas RSPO2/Wnt3a
stimulation increased the number of sphere-like shapes in accordance with the loss of epithelial-typical cell–cell adhesions (Fig.
6F). Notably, most mesenchymal PDAC cell lines also seemed to
possess higher p-ERK levels compared with epithelial lines (Supplementary Fig. S7A).
Lastly, we knocked down ERK or b-catenin (the transcription
factor of canonical Wnt signaling) by siRNA. The latter reduced
GFP levels (Fig. 6G) and both, especially in combination,
signiﬁcantly reduced sphere formation in primary PDAC Patx1
cells (Fig. 6H and I). Of note, concomitant knockdown of
b-catenin and ERK only partially reduced GFP levels, as evidenced by ﬂow cytometric analysis, suggesting a bilateral feedback mechanism (Fig. 6G). In conclusion, these data suggest an
important interplay between canonical Wnt and ERK with
greater effects in high-responding and susceptible cells. Interference with these pathways decreased EMT- and CSC-like
abilities.

b-catenin and relatively high numbers of GFPhigh cells in similar
sections (Fig. 7D). In summary, RSPO2 might be produced,
expressed, and released by multiple cell entities, with the main
beneﬁciary being the pancreatic CSC (Fig. 7E).

Discussion
Metastasis formation and drug resistance are cardinal tumor
traits that negatively impact the prognosis, morbidity, and mortality of patients. The CSC model has been proposed to account
for the observation that in many tumors, a relatively rare neoplastic cell subpopulation seems to drive tumor propagation and
survival (4, 5, 35). CSC behavior is in part regulated by archetypical self-renewal pathways, such as Sonic Hedgehog, Notch,
and Wnt (6, 36, 37), which suggests that cancer stemness
is dynamic and orchestrated by microenvironmental cues
(7, 38, 39). In this work, we approached the question of whether
canonical Wnt signaling plays a role in regulating stem cell
qualities in pancreatic cancer.
To explore different Wnt activation levels, we used a lentiviral
reporter system (23) and found that, ﬁrst, highly intrinsic Wnt
correlates with EMT phenotype, resulting in CSC appearance, as
evidenced in vitro by sphere-forming assays. Second, the same cells
deﬁne a more tumorigenic subpopulation of pancreatic cancer
cells, especially in highly Wnt/RSPO2-responsive cell lines. Here,
7 of 9 Wnthigh L3.6pl tumors developed early and rapidly subcutaneously compared with 1 of 9 Wntlow tumors, whereas
Wnthigh and Wntlow tumor burdens were only marginally different
in Wnt/RSPO2-unresponsive AsPC1 cells (Fig. 3B). Importantly,
orthotopic implants conﬁrmed this behavior with earlier and
faster tumor growth in Wnthigh populations, although Wnthigh
cells per se cycled slower (Fig. 2H and Supplementary Fig. S2G).
Recent reports explain this phenomenon with the presence of
quiescent EMT-like CSCs and mesenchymal-epithelial transition
(MET)-like more differentiated and proliferating cells (40). Here,
we speculate that the higher Wnt activity in PDAC CSCs, the
slower they cycle, but with high propensity to differentiate into
fast-cycling cells in spheres or in vivo. In addition, our experiments
showed that Wnthigh cells preferentially produced Wnthigh progeny in vivo that were more likely to metastasize and produce
RSPO2, whereas Wntlow cells failed to become Wnthigh in secondgeneration transplants and never metastasized (Figs. 3 and 7;
Supplementary Fig. S3). Third, in primary murine pancreatic
cancer cells, we found that CSCs of highly tumorigenic PDAC
overexpressed Wnt enhancer molecules compared with their
more differentiated counterparts. In less aggressive murine PDAC,
this effect was only marginable. Fourth, Wnthigh-sorted cells and
-unsorted cells derived from Wnthigh tumors proved to be more
drug resistant to the standard regimen gemcitabine (a deoxycytidine analogue) as well as to TRAIL. These results show evidence
that intrinsically high activation of canonical Wnt signaling in
PDAC could deﬁne a population of (aggressive) cells with cancer
stemness properties.
Recently, it was shown that pancreatic cancer cells can be
dichotomized as high and low responders to extrinsic Wnt stimuli
(29). The present study aligns with these data and extends our
knowledge regarding many biologic aspects of these subpopulations both in vitro and in vivo. Even within the same pancreatic
cancer line, cells of different Wnt susceptibilities can be identiﬁed
after extrinsic addition of not only Wnt but also RSpo ligands (Fig.
5). The latter factor is of importance, because it was shown

1894 Cancer Res; 75(9) May 1, 2015

previously that the Wnt–LGR5–RSpo axis is crucial to activate
adult pancreatic progenitor cells for long-term in vitro expansion
and, hence, stem cell self-renewal by RSPO1 (41, 42). Varying
intercellular susceptibilities might depend on different baseline
Wnt activity levels that could, in turn, depend on deviations in
regulatory elements of the pathway. Secondly, if certain subsets of
PDAC cells are the source of production of activating Wnt ligands
in a paracrine or juxtacrine manner, Wnthigh cells would then lack
these factors after experimental enrichment and would need
prerequisite "differentiation" into these cells to regenerate the
source. This mechanism might explain why highly susceptible
cells in the present study lost their Wnthigh status after enrichment.
A third explanation might suggest that if the cells are able to selfstimulate in an autocrine manner, receptors of Wnthigh cells might
be mostly saturated, which would impede further stimulatory
effects. Intriguingly, Arensman and colleagues (29) discovered
that pancreatic tumors with high Wnt/b-catenin gene expression
signature in pancreatic tumors strikingly correlated with signiﬁcant lymphovascular invasion patterns, increased tumor size, and
worse disease-speciﬁc survival. Our work explains these discoveries with extensive in vitro and in vivo data (e.g., Wnt-mediated
mesenchymal transformation before invasive processes) and adds
RSPO2 as an important contextual signal.
We found that RSPO2 was overexpressed in susceptible Wnthigh
pancreatic cancer cells and tumors, CSC-enriched tumor spheres,
and gemcitabine-treated cells, which indicates a high level of
importance to this Wnt signaling enhancer. Moreover, RSPO2
alone was able to increase CSC behavior in vitro. Database analysis
revealed mutational RSPO2 ampliﬁcation in pancreatic cancer in
a fair number of cases (8% TCGA data on www.cbioportal.org),
and as the only member of the R-Spondin family, RSPO2 showed
signiﬁcantly higher gene expression in PDAC than in normal
pancreas. We discovered marginally more RSPO2high H-scores in
N1 versus N0 in TMA datasets and positive correlations with
RSPO2high and Zeb1high H-scores, adding further evidence to the
role of RSPO2 in pancreatic CSCs.
Last, we found that intrinsic or extrinsic Wnt stimuli result in
downstream ERK activation by increased phosphorylation levels.
Both pathways seemed to independently control EMT transcription factors SNAIL (by Wnt) and Zeb1 (by ERK), which could be
blocked by speciﬁc inhibitors of the pathways. ERK activation
downstream of canonical Wnt, in this case, could therefore
reinforce cancer stemness in PDAC cells through Zeb1, a wellknown EMT- and CSC regulator in PDAC (5) and other cancers
(43, 44), especially in intrinsically Wnthigh populations. On the
other hand, activation of p-ERK might also be a negative regulator
in a ﬁnely tuned feedback mechanism of pancreatic CSCs.
In conclusion, this work offers insights into intercellular Wnt
heterogeneity in pancreatic cancer cells of the same tumor as well
as different tumors. We also show for the ﬁrst time that RSPO2enhanced canonical Wnt signaling contributes to cancer stemness
traits in a subset of susceptible pancreatic cancers and that RSPO2
production can stem from the pancreatic cancer cell itself or from
other vicinal cells of the tumor microenvironment. Subsequent
ERK activation ampliﬁes and/or regulates Wnt (summarized in
Supplementary Fig. S8). Therefore, testing for RSPO2 overexpression or ampliﬁcation might identify pancreatic cancer patients
who could beneﬁt from a triple combination therapy, e.g., with
gemcitabine and alternating ERK and canonical Wnt signaling
inhibition. Further studies are needed to shed light on the detailed
role of RSPO2 during tumor progression and metastasis, for

Susceptibility to RSPO2 Deﬁnes Pancreatic Cancer Stem Cells

instance in syngeneic mouse models or RSPO2-inducible cell
systems. Deeper insight into a highly complex and variable
response system to the growing canonical Wnt modulation family
is hence necessary, especially with contrary ﬁndings in different
systems (15, 30, 45). Importantly, whole sections of primary
human pancreatic tumors of different origins as well as their
metastasis will improve the current knowledge of the exact location (invasive front vs. tumor center) and colocalization of RSPO2
with EMT and CSC markers.
The concept of phenotypic EMT/MET plasticity versus genetic
predisposition (steady EMT/CSC state) in the context of metastasis was recently discussed in a seminal opinion article (1). It was
suggested that in the case of EMT/MET-capable cancer cells
environmental triggers modify epigenetically epithelial primary
tumor cells, which then circulate as EMT-transformed CSCs and
seed differentiated epithelial metastasis after undergoing MET. In
the case of genetic predisposition, primarily undifferentiated
tumors give rise to equally undifferentiated metastasis due to
their intrinsic genetic endowment that ﬁxes the cancer cells in an
EMT-CSC state. In the ﬁgurative sense, in our model, RSPO2responsive cells might be representative of the phenotypic plasticity type, whereas RSPO2-unresponsive cells might epitomize
the "steady-state" type cells, especially because these cells seemed
to naturally be much more mesenchymal. Ultimately, we believe
that not the baseline level of Wnt, but the functional response and
adaptability to contextual Wnt signals is the determinant for
pancreatic cancer stemness and should be pursued as a CSC
readout.
