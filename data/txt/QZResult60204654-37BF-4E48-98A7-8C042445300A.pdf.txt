Because women with advanced ovarian cancer have poor outcomes, it is imperative to continue exploring for novel therapies. The opportunity for intraperitoneal
treatment, especially in the subgroup of patients with minimal residual disease,
in which the intraperitoneal approach may have a biologic rationale for benefit
over and above the standard intravenous route, needs to be explored to the fullest extent. The MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library databases were
searched up to January 2006 for randomized trials that compared first-line intraperitoneal-containing chemotherapy with first-line intravenous chemotherapy in
the treatment of women with stage III epithelial ovarian cancer. Seven randomized, controlled trials were identified, including 3 large Phase III trials and 4
smaller randomized trials. The 3 large Phase III trials detected statistically significant overall survival benefits with intraperitoneal cisplatin-containing chemotherapy compared with intravenous chemotherapy alone. The improvements in

n North America, ovarian cancer occurs in 10.7 of every 100,000
women and has a mortality rate of 6.1 per 100,000 women.1
Although patients with low-risk, stage I disease can expect an approximate survival rate 90% at 5 years,2 patients who are diagnosed with
advanced regional disease (stage III) or distant disease (stage IV) can
expect a 5-year survival rate of approximately 30% to 50% and 13%,

respectively.2 Unfortunately, approximately 75% of
patients present with advanced disease (stage III or
IV) at diagnosis.3,4
Standard primary treatment for women with
advanced ovarian cancer typically involves cytoreductive surgery and intravenous chemotherapy with a
platinum agent administered either alone or in combination with a taxane. Despite an initial response rate
of approximately 75% with this treatment approach,
most patients who have advanced disease develop a
recurrence and ultimately will die from complications
of the malignancy within 5 years.3
The peritoneal cavity is a common site of ovarian cancer presentation or recurrence, and tumors
tend to remain confined to the peritoneal cavity for
most of their history.5 Because the disease initially
presents on the peritoneum and local patterns of recurrence of this disease involve the peritoneum, the
use of intraperitoneal therapy was explored.
The history of intraperitoneal therapy has both a
clinical and pharmacologic basis. In the 1950s, intraperitoneal chemotherapy was used for controlling
malignant ascites. In the late 1960s, intraperitoneal
access options were explored. In the late 1970s, studies showed the slow clearance of chemotherapy
drugs from the peritoneal cavity. This biochemical
advantage could be exploited in ovarian cancer when
it was possible to administer prolonged concentrations of cisplatin into the peritoneal cavity 10- to 20fold higher than with the conventional intravenous
route.5 Because intraperitoneal cisplatin was capable
of penetrating small-volume tumors (1–3 mm), maximum chemotherapeutic benefit could be derived for
patients with microscopic residual disease or very
small-volume, macroscopic disease.5 In addition, the
use of large doses of intraperitoneal cisplatin meant
not only that the surface of the tumor could be
exposed to high concentrations of cisplatin but also
that, with a sufficient amount of drug leaking into
the circulation, the amount of drug reaching the
tumor through capillary flow was approximately
doubled compared with a maximally tolerated dose
of cisplatin delivered intravenously.6
Given the poor outcome of women with
advanced ovarian cancer, it is imperative to continue
to explore for novel therapies. The opportunity for
intraperitoneal treatment, especially in the subgroup
of patients who have minimal residual disease, for
whom the intraperitoneal approach may have the
biologic rationale of benefit over and above the
standard intravenous route, needs to be explored to
the fullest extent. There remains a critical need to
examine innovative strategies that ultimately may
have an impact on outcome in this disease.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Literature Search Strategy
The literature was searched by using MEDLINE
(Ovid, 1966 through January 2006), EMBASE (Ovid,
1988 through January 2006), the Cochrane Library
(Ovid, Issue 4, 2005), the Physician Data Query database, the Canadian Medical Association Infobase,
and the National Guideline Clearinghouse. In addition, abstracts published in the proceedings of the
meetings of the American Society of Clinical Oncology (1997–2005) and the European Society for Medical Oncology (2002–2004) were searched for evidence
relevant to this review. Reference lists of related literature and recent review articles also were scanned
for additional citations. The literature was searched
for randomized, controlled trials by using the disease-specific terms ovarian neoplasms/ or ovar.ti and
cancer.ti or carcinoma.ti or neoplasms/ combined
with the treatment-specific terms intraperitoneal.ti or
ip.ti or peritoneal.ti.

Study Selection Criteria
Articles were to be selected for inclusion in the systematic review of the evidence if they were published
reports or published abstracts of randomized trials
that compared patients with advanced (stage III)
epithelial ovarian cancer who received first-line treatment that involved intraperitoneal-containing chemotherapy versus first-line treatment that involved
intravenous chemotherapy only. Trials were to report
data on some or all of the outcomes of interest:
response, survival, toxicity, catheter-related complications, and/or quality of life.
Articles were excluded if treatment included
immunotherapy, intraperitoneal radioactive phosphorus (32P), or hyperthermia. Trials also were excluded if
they were reported in a language other than English
and data could not be extracted.

Synthesizing the Evidence
Combining the results across trials added power for
detecting the efficacy of the treatment and improves
the reliability or confidence of the point estimate.
Survival data were pooled using Review Manager
4.0.3 (Metaview Update Software, Oxford, UK), obtained through the Cochrare Collaboration (www.
cochrare.org). Results are expressed as the RR with
95% confidence intervals (CI), where an RR less than
1.0 favors the experimental treatment and an RR
greater than 1.0 favors control. The random effects
model was chosen over the fixed effects model as the
more conservative estimate.7

RESULTS
Literature Search Results
Seven randomized, controlled trials8–14 met the
inclusion criteria. Three were larger Phase III trials,8–10
and 4 were smaller randomized trials.11–14 Table 1
lists the included studies and selected trial characteristics sorted by trial size and design. An additional
report15 that included further information on
Gynecologic Oncology Group (GOG) Trial 172 by

Armstrong et al8 also was identified, and data on
catheter-related outcomes were extracted from that
article.15

Trial Characteristics
To be eligible to participate in the randomized trials,
patients had to have newly diagnosed epithelial ovarian cancer that was either stage III8–11,13 or ranged
from stage II to stage IV.12,14 In 1 trial, approximately

IP Chemotherapy in Advanced Ovarian CA/Elit et al.

12% of patients had stage III primary peritoneal cancer.8 The median patient age ranged from a low of
52.8 years to a high of 61.0 years.8–14 Patients had to
have adequate performance status, blood counts,
and renal and hepatic function8–14 and could not
have received any prior chemotherapy or radiotherapy.8,9,12,14
Across the trials, the majority of patients were
diagnosed with the histologic subtype serous adenocarcinoma.8–14 Trials were conducted in the United
States,8–10,14 Taiwan,11 Italy,12 and Greece.13 Trial participants were predominantly white (90%) in 3 trials,8–10
whereas the remaining trials did not report explicit
information on ethnicity.11–13,14 When it was reported,
patients were stratified by performance status,10,13 the
presence of residual disease,8 the amount of residual
disease,10,13,14 tumor grade,12 whether second-look
surgery was selected,8 the time of enrolment,10 and/or
cooperative group.10 Minimal residual disease was
categorized as tumor that measured 0.5 cm in 1
trial,10 1 cm in 4 trials,8,9,11,14 <2 cm in 1 trial,12 and
2 cm in 2 trials.10,13 Patients decided whether to
undergo second-look laparotomy at registration in 1
trial,8 and all patients with negative disease at the
completion of treatment were requested to undergo a
second-look laparotomy in 6 trials.9–14
With the exception of 1 trial,14 all of the studies
compared combination chemotherapy that included
either cisplatin or carboplatin delivered through intravenous versus intraperitoneal injection.8–13 In that
1 trial, intraperitoneal etoposide was combined with
intraperitoneal cisplatin as part of the investigational
arm.14 In another trial, patients in both treatment
arms also may have received 50 mg/m2 of doxorubicin or epirubicin, depending on their cardiovascular
condition.11 Most of the treatment regimens were
scheduled for 6 cycles of chemotherapy, with the
exception of 1 trial that delivered 8 cycles in the
investigational arm only.9
Protocols for treatment modification included
cycle delay,8–10,13 dose reduction,8 or the addition of
granulocyte-stimulating factor.8 Patients were removed
from the study if treatment delay was >3 weeks8 or
was caused by excess toxicity.10 Dose reductions were
not allowed in 1 trial9 and were not reported in 5
trials.11–14 Patient crossover because of excess toxicity
or catheter-related complications was reported in 3
trials8,9,12 and was not reported in 4 trials.10,11,13,14 One
group of investigators reported that, if toxicity from cisplatin in either treatment arm was intolerable, then
patients were switched to intravenous carboplatin.8
The type of catheters reported was implantable
in 1 trial,8 Tenckhoff in 2 trials,9,11 Port-A-Cath in 2
trials,12,14 and temporary in 2 trials12,13 and was not

695

reported in 1 trial.10 Across the 7 trials, the proportion of patients who received all cycles of the
assigned chemotherapy ranged from 32% to 96% of
patients in the control arms and from 25% to 76% of
patients in the treatment arms that involved intraperitoneal-containing chemotherapy.8–14
Primary outcomes were the pathologic response
rate,9–11,14 progression-free survival,8,9 and/or overall
survival.8–10,12 Quality of life was assessed by using
the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Ovarian (FACT-O) instrument in 1 trial8 and was not
reported in the remaining trials.9–14

Trial Quality
All of the identified trials were nonblinded, randomized, controlled trials.8–14 In reports from 4 trials,
information about the randomization procedure was
provided,8,9,11,12 whereas reports from the remaining
trials did not provide that information.10,13,14 Five
trials8–12 reported patient accrual with sufficient
power to detect significant differences between treatment groups with 1-sided8,9 or 2-sided significance10–12 testing at an a level of .05.8–12 Two trials
did not report power calculations.13,14 Two trials
were stopped early,12,14 and 1 trial was extended for
increased patient accrual.10 In the trial by Gadduci
et al,12 patient accrual was stopped early after 113
patients entered the study. In that trial, only 60% of
eligible patients actually were randomized.12 Another
study was closed early because of poor patient
accrual with the introduction of carboplatin and the
shift in community practice toward carboplatinbased chemotherapy.14 In the trial by Alberts et al,10
a separate analysis of patients who had disease that
measured 0.5 cm was added as part of the study
design. In that trial, patient accrual continued for an
additional year to achieve a sufficiently large sample
size appropriate for analysis.10
Baseline characteristics generally were similar
across treatment groups in all of the 7 trials8–14; however, statistical comparisons between treatment arms
were reported in only 2 trials.11,13 Both of those trials
reported no statistically significant differences in baseline characteristics between treatment groups.11,13
Across 6 trials, completeness of follow-up was
>80%.8–13 In 1 trial, the planned analysis included
only evaluable patients.14 In that trial of 87 patients
who were randomized to receive either intravenous
or intraperitoneal chemotherapy, results for 62 evaluable patients were reported. Five trials reported
an intention-to-treat principle either on eligible
patients8–11 or on the whole randomized study population.12 The proportion of patients deemed ineligible
after randomization ranged from 0% to 17% of the

patient populations.8–12,14 In 1 trial, the number of
patients deemed ineligible was not reported.13 One
trial9 began as a 3-arm study, but the third arm of
cisplatin and cyclophosphamide was discontinued.
Only 66 patients were accrued in that arm, and no
results were reported for those patients.

Outcomes
Table 2 displays response and survival results for the
7 randomized trials that were identified in the review
of the evidence. Response, progression-free survival,
and median survival were the primary outcomes of
interest. Five-year overall survival generally also was
reported or data were available through extraction
from survival curves; however, statistical estimates of

differences between treatment groups were not provided in any of the randomized trials. One trial also
reported disease-free survival as a study endpoint.14
Disease-free survival rates from that study14 are presented in Table 2 under progression-free survival.

Response rates after second-look surgery
No statistically significant differences in clinical or
pathologically confirmed complete response rates
were reported between any of the treatment arms in
any of the trials.8–14 Of the 3 Phase III studies, Armstrong et al8 reported a 16% difference in the complete pathologic response rate in favor of
intraperitoneal versus intravenous chemotherapy, but
only a small proportion of their patients actually

underwent second-look surgery, and response was
not a planned study endpoint. In the remaining 2
trials,9,10 results from second-look surgery were a
planned endpoint but were deemed unreliable
because of low procedure rates and the disproportionate number of procedures performed between
treatment groups. Markman et al9 did not report
results for complete response, whereas Alberts et al10
reported an 11% difference in the complete response
rate in favor of patients who received intraperitoneal
chemotherapy. Across all of the studies, complete
pathologic response rates ranged from 36% to 58%
with intravenous chemotherapy and from 36% to
57% with intraperitoneal chemotherapy.8,10–14

Progression-free survival
Table 2 shows that 2 of the Phase III trials detected
statistically significant 6-month improvements in
median progression-free survival in favor of patients
who received intraperitoneal-containing chemotherapy versus intravenous chemotherapy.8,9 In 1 trial,9
after adjusting for important prognostic factors (residual disease status, cell type, and histologic grade),
the relative risk (RR) estimate decreased slightly from
0.78 (90% confidence interval [90% CI], 0.66–0.94) to
0.75 (90% CI, not reported). Clinically, the longer
median progression-free survival for patients who
received intraperitoneal-containing chemotherapy
reflects an approximate 20% reduction in the risk of
progression compared with patients who received intravenous chemotherapy.
Of the remaining studies, 2 underpowered
trials12,13 reported no statistically significant differences between treatment groups, and 3 trials did not
report results for that outcome.10,11,14 One trial10
reported that the amount of residual disease at the
start of treatment (0.5 cm vs >0.5 cm to 2 cm) was
the most important factor in determining response
regardless of the type of treatment administered
(P ¼ .005). One trial that reported disease-free survival

as an outcome of interest reported no statistically significant differences between treatment arms.14
Although it was not a study endpoint in any of
the randomized trials, there was sufficient information from 3 randomized trials8,9,12 to extract data for
pooling progression-free survival at 5 years. The
remaining trials did not report data sufficient for
pooling.10,11,13,14 Figure 1 shows that, with an RR of
0.91 (95% CI, 0.85–0.98), the pooled data indicate
that treatment involving intraperitoneal chemotherapy extends progression-free survival to a greater
extent than intravenous chemotherapy alone. The
beneficial effect was similar when only the Phase III
trails8,9 were pooled (RR, 0.92; 95% CI, 0.85–0.99).
Thus, after 5 years, the clinical benefit with intraperitoneal-containing chemotherapy still was present
with an approximate 10% reduction in the risk of
progression compared with patients who received intravenous chemotherapy.

Survival
Three large trials reported statistically significant
improvements in median survival with intraperitoneal-containing chemotherapy compared with intravenous chemotherapy.8–10 The improvements in
median survival were 16 months, 11 months, and 8
months in the 3 trials, respectively.8–10 The longer
median survival for patients who received intraperitoneal-containing chemotherapy reflects an approximate 20% to 25% reduction in the risk of death
compared with patients who received intravenous
chemotherapy: a clinically significant benefit.
In the trial by Armstrong et al,8 there were no
significant differences in outcomes between patients
with and without visible residual disease, nor were
there differences when results were analyzed by the
number of eligible patients versus the number of
randomized patients. In that trial, patients in the
treatment arm received an extra dose of intraperitoneal paclitaxel on Day 8.

freedom.

In the trial by Markman et al,9 the results were
similar when adjusted for disease volume, histology,
and age.9 In that trial, patients in the treatment arm
received 8 cycles of chemotherapy, compared with 6
cycles of chemotherapy in the intravenous arm.
In the trial by Alberts et al,10 the factors associated with improved survival were absence of gross
disease (P < .001), younger age (P < .001), type of tumor other than clear cell or mucinous (P < .001), and
timing of enrolment after surgery (P < .001). The size
of residual tumor (0.5 cm or from >0.5 cm to
2 cm) did not affect overall survival outcomes significantly.
Although the other 4 small trials reported no significant differences between treatment groups,11–14 1
underpowered trial did report a nonstatistically significant 16-month improvement in survival with intraperitoneal versus intravenous chemotherapy.12 Fiveyear overall survival was not reported as a study endpoint in any of the randomized trials; however, there
was sufficient information from 6 of the 7 randomized
trials8–12,14 to extract data for pooling results across
trials. The remaining trial did not report data sufficient
for pooling.13 Figure 2 shows that the RR of 0.88 (95%
CI, 0.85–0.98) indicates a greater treatment effect with
intraperitoneal chemotherapy compared with intravenous chemotherapy alone. The effect was similar
when only the Phase III trails were pooled8–10 (RR,
0.85; 95% CI, 0.78–0.94). The pooled results indicate
that the clinical benefit with intraperitoneal-containing chemotherapy after 5 years still was present with
an approximate 12% to 15% reduction in the risk of
death compared with the risk for patients who
received intravenous chemotherapy alone.

Adverse events associated with chemotherapy
Table 3 presents the most common grade 3 or 4
adverse events reported across the 7 trials identified
in the search of the literature. On average, more sta-

tistically significant adverse events were detected in
patients who received intraperitoneal-containing
chemotherapy compared with patients who received
intravenously administered chemotherapy. The most
common severe adverse events reported were hematologic and gastrointestinal. In 2 trials, approximately
75% of patients experienced severe leucopenia with
intraperitoneal chemotherapy8,9; and, in 1 trial,
almost 50% of patients experienced severe gastrointestinal adverse events with intraperitoneal chemotherapy.8 In contrast, 3 trials reported significantly
less leucopenia with cyclophosphamide and intraperitoneal cisplatin10,11 or carboplatin13 compared with
identical doses delivered intravenously. One trial10
also reported significantly less tinnitus, clinical hearing loss, and neuromuscular toxic effects in patients
who received intraperitoneal chemotherapy. In 2
trials,10,13 grade 2 abdominal pain was significantly
greater in the intraperitoneal group (P < .01). Significant transient dyspnea also was observed in patients
who received intraperitoneal chemotherapy and may
have be related to compression of the base of the
lung by the fluid-filled intraperitoneal cavity.10,13
Patient death caused by treatment was an infrequent occurrence, and there generally were similar
rates detected between treatment groups. The greatest difference was 2 deaths in the intraperitoneal
arm and no deaths in the intravenous arm in 1 of
the trials.10
On average, adherence to the assigned chemotherapy regimen was greater for patients who received intravenous chemotherapy compared with
patients who received intraperitoneal chemotherapy
(Table 1). In the trial by Armstrong et al,8 only 42%
of patients completed the assigned intraperitoneal
chemotherapy regimen. In that trial, of 205 eligible
patients in the intraperitoneal chemotherapy arm, 84
patients received 1 course(s) of intravenous chemotherapy, and 37 patients received carboplatin instead

of cisplatin. Twenty-nine percent of patients discontinued intraperitoneal chemotherapy because of nausea, emesis, dehydration, renal, or metabolic adverse
events.15 In another trial,9 18% of patients received
2 courses of intraperitoneal chemotherapy therapy
primarily because of excessive bone marrow toxicity
with initial doses of intravenous carboplatin (area
under the curve [AUC], 9). In 1 trial in which toxicity
was roughly similar between the 2 treatment arms,
20 patients (32%) switched to intravenous chemotherapy primarily because of patient refusal and/or
logistic issues.12 In that trial, 11% of patients crossed
over to intravenous chemotherapy prior to receiving
any intraperitoneal chemotherapy.12 The remaining
trials10,11,13,14 did not report details on toxicityrelated treatment discontinuation or cross over to intravenous chemotherapy.

Complications associated with intraperitoneal
chemotherapy
The type of catheters employed varied within and
among trials; and, as shown in Table 4, complications
associated with intraperitoneal chemotherapy were
not reported consistently. Of the 24% to 75% of
patients who were not able to complete the assigned
intraperitoneal chemotherapy regimen, only the authors of GOG Trial 172 explicitly reported the number

of patients who discontinued treatment because of
catheter-related complications.8,15 Of the 119 patients
who discontinued intraperitoneal treatment, catheterrelated complications were either the primary factors
(34%) or the contributing factors (8%) behind the decision to cross over to intravenous chemotherapy.8,15 In
2 other trials,12,14 10% and 16% of patients experienced catheter-related complications that required
treatment discontinuation. Catheter-related complications included abdominal pain, bleeding, infection,
peritonitis, catheter blockage, leakage, movement,
malfunction, and/or access problems.
In 1 trial,8,15 whether or not the intraperitoneal
catheter was placed during the primary surgery did
not appear to be significant. On a related note, with
an increased incidence of infected catheters at the
time of surgery, patients who underwent left colon or
rectosigmoid resections were less likely to initiate intraperitoneal chemotherapy than patients who did
not undergo those procedures (16% vs 5%; P ¼ .012)
and also were less likely to complete all 6 cycles of
intraperitoneal chemotherapy (34% vs 44%; P value
not reported).

Quality of life
Only 1 of the 7 trials reported quality-of-life outcomes.8 With lower FACT-O scores representing a

poorer quality of life, Armstrong et al8 reported significantly lower scores for patients in the intraperitoneal
chemotherapy arm versus patients in the intravenous
chemotherapy arm prior to randomization (106.4 vs
111.9; P ¼ .03), before the fourth cycle (103.3 vs 114.7;
P<.001), and at 3 to 6 weeks after the sixth cycle (110.5
vs 118.4; P ¼ .009). The difference in quality-of-life
scores was not significant between treatment groups
at 12 months after the completion of the sixth cycle of
chemotherapy (125.5 vs 127.2; P ¼ .56).

Three large Phase III trials and 4 smaller randomized
trials inform the role of intraperitoneal chemotherapy in the first-line treatment of women with ovarian
cancer. It is the results from the 3 Phase III trials
that were powered sufficiently to detect meaningful
survival differences between treatment groups that
steer the discussion and inform the conclusions.
Although the phase III trials detected clinically
and statistically significant survival advantages with
intraperitoneal chemotherapy, there are several important reasons for the uncertainty surrounding the
use of intraperitoneal chemotherapy as a standard
practice for this patient population. One reason is
that the optimal intraperitoneal chemotherapy regimen has yet to be defined. In the trial that produced
the greatest survival benefits detected to date by
Armstrong et al8, grade 3 or 4 toxicity was much
more common in patients who received intraperitoneal chemotherapy, and most patients (58%) were
unable to complete the assigned cycles of treatment.
It is possible that the increase in toxicity was caused
by the intraperitoneal dose of paclitaxel administered
on Day 8 after intraperitoneal cisplatin; however,
even in the control arm with fewer adverse events,
the severe toxicity associated with intravenous paclitaxel and cisplatin remained considerable. The same
applies to the trial by Markman et al9; although, in
that trial, the increased toxicity in the treatment arm
may have arisen from the additional 2 cycles of carboplatin (AUC, 9) administered only to patients in
the intraperitoneal treatment arm. As a better-tolerated agent in place of cisplatin, intravenous carboplatin AUC 5 or 6 is administered as first-line
treatment in this patient population, and intravenous
paclitaxel at a dose of 175 mg/m2 is administered
over 3 hours instead of over 24 hours, like in the studies by Armstrong et al8 and Markman et al,9 to
reduce neurotoxicity. Historically, in a retrospective
study, a lower response rate was detected with 200
mg/m2 to 300 mg/m2 of intraperitoneal carboplatin
compared with 100 mg/m2 to 105 mg/m2 of intraper-

itoneal cisplatin for small-volume, residual cancer16;
however; there is more recent literature on the use of
higher doses of intraperitoneal carboplatin. In 1
study, a combination of intraperitoneal carboplatin
with intravenous paclitaxel at 175 mg/m2 had an acceptable toxicity rate at an AUC of 6 to 7.17 Another
study revealed that survival rates appeared to be
higher among patients who received an intraperitoneal carboplatin dose >400 mg/m2 compared with
patients who received doses less than this threshold.18 There also is some suggestion that intraperitoneal carboplatin may be more efficacious than
intravenous carboplatin19; thus, the use of intraperitoneal carboplatin may be an attractive substitution
for intraperitoneal cisplatin. However, there have
been no randomized comparisons between intraperitoneal cisplatin and carboplatin to date. Furthermore, the 3 trials that showed a survival advantage
in the current evidence series used intraperitoneal
cisplatin.8–10 Thus, the role and optimal dose of intraperitoneal carboplatin are yet to be determined.
Second, the optimal patient population still is
under debate, because the greatest benefits were
observed in patients who had residual disease volumes
1 cm in any single area. For patients who have residual disease volumes >1 cm, it has been established
that there is poor tumor penetration in bulky disease
with intraperitoneal chemotherapy, but it is not known
how this impacts on survival outcomes.
Third, there are important catheter-related complications and difficulties with implantation associated with intraperitoneal chemotherapy that
patients and clinicians may be reluctant to accept.
Alberts et al20 suggested that complications, such as fibrosis-sheath formation and small bowel obstruction
or perforation, can be reduced with the use of the
Port-A-Cath designed for intravenous injection, and
Armstrong et al8 suggested that complications may be
reduced with the standardization of the catheter device and of the technique and timing of port implantation. Despite potential future improvements in
catheterization devices and implantation, in the trial
by Armstrong et al,8 catheter-related complications
played a large role in patient’s decisions to cross over
to intravenous chemotherapy.8,15 In the review by
Markman and Walker,21 practical guidance is provided
for the delivery of intraperitoneal chemotherapy.
Those authors reported that venous and intraperitoneal access devices may be placed at the time of initial
surgery (resection and staging laparotomy) provided
that surgery is optimal and without complications or,
in the alternative, that such devices also may be
placed several weeks after initial surgery. The drugdelivery device should be a fully implantable port

701

attached to a large, single-lumen, venous, silicone
catheter to avoid kinks and flow obstructions. In addition, peritoneal catheters with fenestrations and
Dacron cuffs should not be used, because they are
associated with complications and are not removed
easily in the office setting under local anesthesia.
Specific issues around the delivery of intraperitoneal
chemotherapy, such as flushing the catheter with heparin, mixing and warming the chemotherapy agents,
dealing with pain, hydration, and the assessment of
peritonitis and/or gastrointestinal injury, are detailed
further in that review.21
In conclusion, as front-line therapy for patients
with optimally debulked stage III ovarian cancer, intraperitoneal chemotherapy confers an improved survival benefit in a patient population at high risk for
disease recurrence. The increased survival benefits
observed with intraperitoneal chemotherapy must be
weighed against increased toxicity and complication
rates related to catheterization. The optimal disease
volumes for front-line therapy still are open to
debate along with the optimal intraperitoneal chemotherapy regimens for front-line therapy. The greatest
survival benefits reported to date were detected in
patients who had 1 cm of residual disease in any 1
area with 135 mg/m2 of intravenous paclitaxel over
24 hours on Day 1, 100 mg/m2 of intraperitoneal cisplatin on Day 2, and 60 mg/m2 of intraperitoneal
paclitaxel on Day 8 repeated every 21 days for 6
cycles. On that schedule, however, only 42% of
patients were able to complete all 6 cycles of the
assigned treatment.
The role of intraperitoneal chemotherapy in the
first-line treatment of women with stage III epithelial
ovarian cancer still is emerging. Overall, cisplatinbased, intraperitoneal chemotherapy for the first-line
treatment of women with stage III epithelial ovarian
cancer is a viable treatment option that should be
offered to patients on the basis of significant improvements in overall survival. In the United States, the
National Cancer Institute and the Society of Gynecologic Oncologists have endorsed the use of intraperitoneal chemotherapy in recent position papers.22,23 In
Canada, the Society of Gynecologic Oncologists of
Canada also has endorsed the use of intraperitoneal
chemotherapy.24 In each case, the provision of endorsement was that the appropriate clinical and institutional multidisciplinary facilities were needed for the
safe delivery of this treatment in optimally debulked
patients—a provision that supports the concerns
raised in this review of the evidence. Future research
in the randomized setting should focus on the optimal
patient population to receive treatment and the best
possible intraperitoneal chemotherapy regimen, in-

702

CANCER

cluding the most appropriate agents, infusate volume,
schedule, and dose. The utility of intraperitoneal
chemotherapy in various other patient populations
with ovarian cancer, such as those with early-stage,
high-risk disease, also should be explored in a prospective fashion.
