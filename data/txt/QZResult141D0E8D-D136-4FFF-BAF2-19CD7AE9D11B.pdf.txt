ABSTRACT
Chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) is a myeloproliferative disorder promoted by
the constitutive tyrosine kinase activity of Bcr-Abl oncoprotein. Although treatment
with the Bcr-Abl-inhibitor imatinib represents the first-line therapy against CML,
almost 20-30% of patients develop chemotherapeutic resistance and require
alternative therapy. Here we show that a strong hyper-phosphorylation/activation
of ERK1/2, Akt Ser473, and 40S ribosomal protein S6 (rpS6) is detectable in imatinibresistant KCL22 and K562 CML cells as compared to the -sensitive cell variants. In
imatinib-resistant CML cells, high concentration of imatinib is required to strongly
inhibit Bcr-Abl, ERK1/2 and Akt Ser473 phosphorylation, but under these conditions
the phosphorylation of rpS6, a common downstream effector of MEK/ERK1/2 and
PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathways is only slightly reduced. By contrast, down-regulation
of the protein kinase CK2 by the inhibitor CX-5011 or by silencing the CK2 subunits
does not affect the activation state of MEK/ERK1/2 or PI3K/Akt/mTOR signalling,
but causes a drop in rpS6 phosphorylation in parallel with reduced protein synthesis.
CK2-inhibition by CX-5011 induces cell death by apoptosis and acts synergistically
with imatinib or the MEK-inhibitor U0126 in reducing the viability of imatinib-resistant
CML cells. The ternary mixture containing CX-5011, imatinib and U0126 represents
the most effective synergistic combination to counteract CML cell viability.
These results disclose a novel CK2-mediated mechanism of acquired imatinibresistance resulting in hyper-phosphorylation of rpS6. We suggest that co-targeting
CK2 and MEK protein kinases is a promising strategy to restore responsiveness of
resistant CML cells to imatinib.

the front-line therapy for CML patients. However, up to
one third of patients acquire resistance or intolerance to
imatinib and require alternative therapies [4, 5]. Although
resistance to imatinib is mainly caused by genetic and/
or functional alterations of Bcr-Abl oncoprotein, BcrAbl-independent mechanisms of imatinib-resistance
have been also described, including CML stem cell
quiescence, expression of multi-drug-resistant phenotype
or activation of alternative oncogenic pathways upstream
or downstream of Bcr-Abl [4, 5, 6, 7]. The knowledge
of these mechanisms has provided the opportunity
for a second generation of dual-specific inhibitors or
combination therapies to overcome the limitation of
imatinib-resistance [5, 8, 9].

INTRODUCTION
Chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) is a malignant
myeloproliferative disorder of primitive pluripotent
stem cells arisen from the chromosomal translocation
[t(9;22)(q11;q34)], which gives rise to the BCR-ABL1
fusion oncogene [1]. The tyrosine kinase activity of
the resulting Bcr-Abl oncoprotein is necessary and
sufficient for initiation, maintenance and progression
of CML phenotype. Bcr-Abl triggers the activation of
multiple pathways that cooperate to drive critical prosurvival advantage counteracting cellular apoptosis [2,
3]. Targeting Bcr-Abl activity by the selective and potent
Bcr-Abl-inhibitor imatinib mesylate (Gleevec) has become

Protein kinase CK2 is a highly conserved and
constitutively active Ser/Thr protein kinase, which
is usually present as a tetramer composed of two
catalytic (α and/or α’) and two regulatory (β) subunits.
This protein kinase is distributed in all subcellular
compartments, where it phosphorylates a huge number
of protein substrates implicated in fundamental cellular
processes [10–12]. CK2 is abnormally elevated in many
human cancers, where it plays a global role as an antiapoptotic and a pro-survival agent [13–15]. This protein
kinase has never been described as the main driver of
malignant transformation in cancer cells but rather as
a critical cooperating partner of tumorigenic pathways
able to potentiate the effect of known oncogenes [11].
CK2 up-regulation has been also shown in cancer cells
displaying resistance mechanisms, either related to a
multidrug resistance phenotype or induced by specific
drugs [8, 16, 17]. We have recently demonstrated that, in
imatinib-resistant CML LAMA84 cells, both expression
and activity of CK2 are up-regulated as compared to
imatinib-sensitive cells and that CK2 co-operates with
Bcr-Abl to maintain the CML phenotype. Consistently,
the combination of CK2-inhibition and imatinibtreatment acts synergistically in counteracting LAMA84
cell viability [8]. Interestingly, sensitization towards
imatinib observed upon CK2-inhibition occurs also in
imatinib-resistant CML cell lines that do not express
abnormally high CK2 protein level [8].
This study provides new insights into molecular
mechanisms of imatinib-resistance related to CK2 in CML
KCL22 and K562 cell lines, where the drug treatment
does not induce an up-regulation of the kinase. Particular
attention is focused on MEK/ERK1/2 and PI3K/Akt/
mTOR survival pathways to highlight a potential CK2mediated hyper-activation induced by imatinib-resistance.
The potent and very selective CK2-inhibitor CX-5011
is used in combination with imatinib and the inhibitor
of MEK to define new therapeutic strategies able to
overcome imatinib-resistance.

highlight a potential role played by CK2 in resistant CML
cell lines, we focused our attention on the two Bcr-Abl
downstream survival pathways MEK/ERK1/2 and PI3K/
Akt/mTOR [2, 3], which are also under the control of
CK2 at different levels [20–23] (see Figure 8). Expression
and phosphorylation/activation state of different proteins
involved in these two signalling cascades were first
compared in imatinib-sensitive and -resistant KCL22
cells by means of western blot analysis with specific
phospho-antibodies. Whereas the level of total ERK1/2
is similar in S- and R-KCL22 cells, imatinib-resistant
cells are characterized by a striking hyper-activation of
ERK1/2 as demonstrated by the hyper-phosphorylation
of the residues Thr202/Tyr204 [24] (Figure 2A). ERK1/2catalyzed phosphorylation of RSK Thr573 is the first step
for its activation [25]. The phosphorylation level of RSK
Thr573 as well as that of RSK Ser221, which triggers the
kinase activation [25], are similar in the two cell variants

Hyper-phosphorylation of ERK1/2, Akt Ser473

CML KCL22 and K562 cells, either sensitive (S) or
resistant (R) to imatinib were used in our investigation. In
these cell lines, resistance to imatinib is not caused either
by BCR-ABL1 gene amplification or by mutations of the
Bcr-Abl kinase domain [18] or by expression of the efflux
drug transporter P-glycoprotein [19]. Western blot analysis
of cellular lysates demonstrates that imatinib-resistant
KCL22 and K562 cells contain comparable protein-level
of CK2 subunits (Figure 1A), [8] and similar CK2 activity

(Figure 2A), suggesting that RSK pathway is not affected
by the anomalous hyper-activation of ERK1/2 induced by
imatinib-resistance.
PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway was then analysed. It
is well known that Akt becomes active following the
phosphorylation of Thr308 and Ser473 [26]. Akt can be
further regulated by the CK2-mediated phosphorylation
of Ser129, which prevents the dephosphorylation of Akt
Thr308 maintaining the kinase in its active conformation
[21, 27]. Our analysis of Akt at Ser473 reveals that this

activating residue is more phosphorylated in R-KCL22
that it is in S-KCL22 cells (Figure 2B). Consistently,
an increased phosphorylation of the Akt targets mTOR
Ser2448 and GSK3ß Ser9 is observed, confirming the
occurrence of an anomalous Akt activation induced by
imatinib-resistance. In contrast with Akt Ser473, the
activation state of Akt Thr308 is unaffected by the drugresistance (Figure 2B). The constitutive phosphorylation of
Akt Ser129, catalysed by CK2, is also similar in imatinibsensitive and -resistant KCL22 cells (Figure 2B) consistent

rpS6 phosphorylation is dependent on CK2 in
imatinib-resistant KCL22 cells

with the comparable CK2 protein expression and activity
found in the two cell variants (Figure 1).
Next, we analysed the 40S ribosomal protein S6
(rpS6), a downstream effector of both MEK/ERK1/2
and PI3K/Akt/mTOR signalling cascades. In particular,
we examined the phosphorylation extent of the residues
Ser235 and Ser236 that can be phosphorylated by both
RSK and p70S6K [28] (see Figure 8). Phosphorylation
of rpS6 appears almost 2-fold higher in R-KCL22 cells as
compared to the parental cell line, while its protein-level is
similar (Figure 2C). The activation state of RSK has been
shown to be similar in S- and R-KCL22 cells (Figure 2A).
Therefore we analysed the phosphorylation of Thr389,
which is required for p70S6K activation and is catalysed
by mTORC1 (mTOR complex 1) [29], demonstrating
that also the activation state of p70S6K is comparable in
S- and R-KCL22 (Figure 2C). These results suggest that
the hyper-phosphorylation of rpS6 is not directly mediated
by an increased activation of its kinases RSK and p70S6K
(see Figure 8). As in the case of p70S6K, the other main
mTORC1-substrate 4E-BP1 (the eukaryotic translational
initiation factor 4E binding protein 1) is similarly expressed
and phosphorylated in the two cell variants (Figure 2C).
The hyper-activated proteins identified in
R-KCL22 cells were then analysed in K562 cells
comparing their phosphorylation extent in imatinibsensitive and -resistant cell variants. Figure 2D shows
that, also in these CML cells, imatinib-resistance is
associated with an increased phosphorylation of ERK1/2
Thr202/Tyr204 (more than 2-fold), Akt Ser473 (almost
2-fold) and rpS6 (about 5-fold).

In an attempt to identify the protein kinase(s)
responsible for rpS6 hyper-phosphorylation occurring in
imatinib-resistance, R-KCL22 cells were treated with the
inhibitors of the well-known pathways leading to this protein
phosphorylation. We also used CX-5011 (Glixx Laboratories,
South Borough, MA), a derivative of CX-4945, the first
clinical stage inhibitor of CK2 for the treatment of solid
tumours [30]. CX-5011 was preferred over CX-4945 for its
comparable potency and higher selectivity [12].
MEK-inhibitor U0126, which strongly reduces
ERK1/2 phosphorylation/activation [31], only partially
(about 20%) counteracts rpS6 phosphorylation in
R-KCL22 cells (Figure 4A, compare lanes 1 and 2),
while cell treatment with CX-5011 causes a drop in
rpS6 phosphorylation of about 65% (Figure 4A, lane 3).
The effect of CX-5011 on CK2 activity is confirmed by
the almost abrogation of the CK2-mediated Akt Ser129
phosphorylation. Under our experimental conditions,
however, CK2-inhibition does not counteract the activities
of Bcr-Abl, ERK1/2 nor that of Akt as demonstrated by
the comparable phosphorylation extent of Akt Ser473
and Thr308, and of Akt target GSK3ß Ser9. Furthermore,
CX-5011 treatment does not affect the activation state
of p70S6K as indicated by its phosphorylation extent at

rpS6 phosphorylation is independent of Bcr-Abl
in imatinib-resistant KCL22 cells
The inhibitory effect of imatinib on the pathways
deregulated by the drug-resistance was compared in
S- and R-KCL22 cells. In sensitive cells the treatment
with 1 μM imatinib for 4 h is sufficient to efficiently
counteract Bcr-Abl auto-phosphorylation and to block its
downstream signalling as demonstrated by the abrogation
of ERK1/2, Akt Ser473 and rpS6 phosphorylation
(Figure 3). As expected, in R-KCL22 cells a higher
concentration of imatinib is required to promote a strong
inhibition of the phosphorylation extent of Bcr-Abl
and its downstream effectors ERK1/2 and Akt Ser473,
while Akt phospho-Thr308 is not inhibited even by this
drug concentration. The additional observation that high
imatinib concentration does not reduce Akt phosphoSer129, demonstrates that the drug is not effective on
CK2 activity (Figure 3). Of note, Bcr-Abl inhibition only
marginally reduces (about 15%) the phosphorylation level
of rpS6, outlining a Bcr-Abl-independent mechanism
that sustains cell survival and cooperates to increase the
DC50 (concentration inducing 50% of cell death) value for
imatinib from 0.9 μM in S-KCL22 cells to about 40 μM in
R-KCL22 cells (data not shown).

Thr389 (Figure 4A, lane 3). As expected, cell treatment with
rapamycin, an inhibitor of mTORC1 [32], almost abrogates
both the phosphorylation of rpS6 and that of p70S6K
Thr389 as also suggested by the kinase faster migration in
SDS/PAGE [33] (Figure 4A, lane 4). Rapamycin treatment,
however, does not inhibit the phosphorylation/activation of
the other analysed protein kinases.
Collectively taken, these observations indicate that
in imatinib-resistant KCL22 cells: i) rpS6 phosphorylation
is only slightly mediated by MEK/ERK1/2 signalling;
ii) the CK2-inhibitor CX-5011 strongly inhibits rpS6
phosphorylation under conditions that do not affect the
activation state of either MEK/ERK1/2 or PI3K/Akt/
mTOR/p70S6K pathway; iii) the mTORC1-inhibitor
rapamycin abrogates the phosphorylation of p70S6K
and of its substrate rpS6; iv) two independent pathways
strongly prevent the phosphorylation of rpS6.
To further support the specific role played by CK2
in imatinib-resistance, we performed RNA-interference
experiments knocking down the expression of the different
CK2 subunits in R-KCL22 cells. Down-regulation of
either the regulatory (β) or catalytic (α and α’) subunits
is associated with a drop of rpS6 phosphorylation (Figure
4B). As observed with the pharmacological inhibition of
CK2 (Figure 4A, lane 3), silencing CK2 activity does
not affect the phosphorylation extent of Akt Ser473 and
Thr308 nor that of p70S6K Thr389, confirming that PI3K/
Akt/mTOR signalling is not influenced by the protein
kinase down-regulation.
To investigate more deeply the potential interplay
occurring between CK2 and p70S6K in mediating rpS6
phosphorylation, R-KCL22 cells were treated with
inhibitors specific for the two protein kinases. Figure
4C confirms that CK2-inhibition by CX-5011 strongly
counteracts rpS6 phosphorylation without affecting
the activation state of p70S6K associated with Thr389
phosphorylation (compare lanes 1 and 2). PF-4708671
(PF) is a potent and selective inhibitor of p70S6K
that induces an enhancement of the mTOR-catalysed
phosphorylation of p70S6K at Thr389 [34] (Figure
4C, lanes 3,4). Cell treatment with 10 μM PF-4708671
strongly inhibits rpS6 phosphorylation, while it does not
affect the CK2 activity as indicated by the phosphorylation
extent of Akt Ser129, which is comparable to that of
control (Figure 4C, lane 4). These results demonstrate that,
in imatinib-resistant KCL22 cells, inhibition of either CK2
or p70S6K almost abolishes rpS6 phosphorylation, while
the inhibition of one kinase does not influence the activity
of the other.
It has been shown that CK2 phosphorylates p70S6K
at Ser17 without affecting its kinase activity, but regulating
its nuclear-cytoplasmic shuttling by enhancing its nuclear
export in NIH3T3 cells [22]. To analyse the occurrence of
a similar regulatory mechanism in CML cells, nuclear and
cytoplasmic fractions were isolated from imatinib-resistant
KCL22 cells treated with DMSO or CX-5011. 20 μg of
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

protein fractions (corresponding to 20% of total protein
extracted from nuclei and only 3.3% of cytoplasmic
proteins) were then examined by western blot. Figure 4D
shows that in control cells most of p70S6K is located in
the cytoplasm of the leukemic cells, where also rpS6 is
mainly detectable. Cell treatment with CX-5011 does not
influence significantly the distribution of either p70S6K
or rpS6, ruling out the hypothesis that CK2-inhibition
might counteract rpS6 phosphorylation by affecting the
translocation of its kinase p70S6K.
Since the report by Panasyuk et al. demonstrated by
transfection experiments that p70S6K is also a binding
partner of CK2 [22], we analysed the potential interaction
occurring between the two proteins in imatinib-sensitive
and -resistant KCL22 cells. Figure 4E shows that p70S6K
does not co-immunoprecipitate with CK2 in the two cell
variants either treated or not with CX-5011, excluding
that, in imatinib-resistant cells, CK2 might influence rpS6
phosphorylation by interacting with p70S6K.
To further analyse the mechanism underlying the
regulation of rpS6 phosphorylation by CK2, we examined
whether the phosphorylation of the canonical rpS6 phosphosites might be influenced by a potential CK2-catalyzed
phosphorylation of the ribosomal protein at different
site(s). To this purpose the protein was immunoprecipitated
from R-KCL22 cell lysates, dephosphorylated by lambda
phosphatase and subsequently phosphorylated in vitro in the
presence of [γ33P]ATP by recombinant CK2 holoenzyme.
The outcome that rpS6 is not phosphorylated by CK2 (data
not shown) suggests that the kinase does not act directly on
the ribosomal protein.

CK2-inhibition affects protein synthesis
efficiency in imatinib-resistant KCL22 and K562
cells
Since rpS6 phosphorylation is essential for protein
synthesis and cell growth [35], we verified whether
CK2-inhibition could affect the rate of the global protein
synthesis by performing metabolic labelling experiments.
Imatinib-resistant KCL22 and K562 cells, pre-treated with
DMSO or CX-5011 for 4 h, were pulsed in the presence
of a radiolabelled methionine and cysteine medium
mix before quantification of total protein labelling. As
expected, cell treatment with CX-5011 strongly decreases
rpS6 phosphorylation, whereas the level of total rpS6
protein is unaffected (Figure 4F, left panel). Compared
to controls, CK2-inhibition reduces the protein synthesis
of about 43% and 25% in R-KCL22 and R-K562 cells,
respectively (Figure 4F, right panel).

Cell treatment with CX-5011 inhibits KCL22 cell
viability by apoptosis induction
It has been reported that the inhibitors of the MEK/
ERK1/2 pathway, including U0126, can be classified
18209

Oncotarget

as cytostatic but not as cytotoxic anticancer drugs [36]
and that rapamycin does not inhibit the cell viability
of imatinib-resistant cells by inducing apoptosis [37].
We analysed the apoptosis occurrence by comparing
the cleavage of the caspase substrate PARP caused by
treatment of KCL22 cells with imatinib, CX-5011,
U0126 or rapamycin. 1 μM imatinib induces a substantial
PARP cleavage in sensitive cells, while, as expected, it
is ineffective on the imatinib-resistant variant (Figure
5A, compare lanes 1 and 2). On the contrary, treatment
of imatinib-sensitive cells with CX-5011 up to 10 μM
concentration induces only a partial PARP fragmentation,
while 2 μM concentration is sufficient to cleave completely
the protein in R-KCL22 cells and to induce a parallel
proteolysis of cellular proteins, including α-tubulin (Figure
5A, lanes 3-5). This finding demonstrates that imatinibresistant cells critically rely on CK2 for their survival.
Addition of U0126 and rapamycin does not cause any
appreciable effect on PARP cleavage in R-KCL22 cells
(Figure 5A, lanes 6 and 7, respectively).

To further analyse the mechanism of cell death
triggered by CX-5011, we evaluated the nucleosome
formation in both imatinib-sensitive and -resistant KCL22
cells. Figure 5B shows that CK2-inhibition causes
apoptosis in both cell lines with a cytosolic enrichment of
nucleosomes much more pronounced in imatinib-resistant
than in parental cell line, confirming that resistant cells
become dependent on CK2 for their survival more than
their sensitive counterpart.

Co-targeting CK2 and MEK protein kinases
synergistically overcomes the imatinib-resistance
of R-KCL22 and R-K562 cells
We have recently found that co-treatment with
imatinib plus CX-4945, a CK2-inhibitor of the same class
of CX-5011 but less selective, causes a synergistic effect
in reducing the cell viability of imatinib-resistant CML
cell lines [8]. It has been also shown that the combination
of imatinib and inhibitors of the MEK/ERK1/2 pathway

may counteract the resistance to imatinib in CML cells
[38, 39]. To unravel the potential effect of new drug
combinations directed to different oncogenic targets
activated by imatinib-resistance, CML cells were treated
with imatinib, U0126 and CX-5011. We examined
whether these drugs, added in different combinations
to R-KCL22 and R-K562 cell cultures, could induce
higher cytotoxicity as compared to the single treatments.
Imatinib-resistant cells were treated for 48 h with
inhibitors either alone, in binary or in ternary association,
by increasing simultaneously the concentrations of

the drugs added at fixed ratio [40]. Cell viability was
determined by the MTT method and the viability was
plotted as function of the single inhibitor concentrations
(Figures 6 and 7). All the combined treatments promote
a synergistic reduction of cell viability, as judged from
the combination index (C.I.) calculated at the 50%
of cell lethality, which denotes synergism if < 1 [40].
Our data show that CX-5011 strongly synergizes with
imatinib with C.I. values of 0.50 and 0.32 in R-KCL22
and R-K562 cells, respectively (Figures 6A and 7A).

DISCUSSION

good synergistic effect is observed with C.I. values of
0.53 and 0.54 in R-KCL22 and R-K562, respectively,
demonstrating that CK2-inhibition causes a substantial
enhancement of U0126 effect (Figures 6B and 7B). The
combination of imatinib with U0126 induces synergistic
C.I. values of 0.60 and 0.33 in R-KCL22 and R-K562
cells, respectively (Figures 6C and 7C). Notably, the
ternary mixture of CX-5011 with imatinib and U0126
represents the most effective synergistic combination
to inhibit the viability of R-KCL22 (C.I. value = 0.35)
and R-K562 cells (C.I. value = 0.17) and to restore
responsiveness to low imatinib concentration (Figures 6D
and 7D).

We have previously demonstrated that the protein
kinase CK2 is over-expressed in imatinib-resistant
LAMA84 cells as compared to the -sensitive variant
and that CK2 up-regulation strengthens the imatinibresistance phenotype conferring survival advantage
against imatinib [8]. In this study we analyse the
CML KCL22 and K562 cell lines, characterized by
a similar expression and activity of CK2 in imatinibsensitive and -resistant cell variants (Figure 1), to gain
information about unknown mechanisms of imatinibresistance possibly related to CK2 even in the absence

of its up-regulation. The involvement of CK2 in CML
imatinib-resistance is investigated at multiple levels
since this kinase does not act in a hierarchical way, but
as a lateral player of the oncogenic signal transduction
pathways [11]. Our results, on one hand, have led to the
identification of a new Bcr-Abl-independent mechanism
of resistance, and on the other, support the view that
CK2 plays a general role in the oncogenic network
related to CML imatinib-resistance, showing that its upregulation is not a critical requirement for its contribution
to imatinib-resistant phenotype. Analysis of KCL22 and
K562 cells demonstrates that MEK/ERK1/2 and PI3K/
Akt/mTOR pathways are up-regulated in imatinibresistant cells as compared to the sensitive counterparts
(Figure 2). Hyper-activation of MEK/ERK1/2 in imatinibresistant CML cell lines has been previously described
[38, 39, 41]. We also demonstrate an up-regulation of Akt
revealed by the imatinib-induced hyper-phosphorylation

of Ser473, one of the two canonical Akt activation sites,
and confirmed by the hyper-phosphorylation of the Aktsubstrates mTOR and GSK3ß (Figure 2B and 2D). The
finding that the Akt regulatory site Thr308 is similarly
phosphorylated in imatinib-sensitive and -resistant
KCL22 cells supports the notion that Thr308 and Ser473
fulfil essential, distinct, and non-overlapping functions
as demonstrated by ablation or mutation of the two
regulatory sites [42, 43]. Consistent with the activation
of MEK/ERK1/2 and PI3K/Akt/mTOR signalling, the
ribosomal protein S6, a common downstream effector of
both pathways (see Figure 8), is hyper-phosphorylated
at Ser235-236 in imatinib-resistant as compared to
-sensitive KCL22 and K562 cells (Figure 2C and 2D).
Cell treatment with U0126, however, demonstrates that
rpS6 phosphorylation is only slightly (about 20%) under
the control of MEK/ERK1/2 signalling in imatinibresistant KCL22 (Figure 4A).

The specific role played by Bcr-Abl or CK2 on
the pathways up-regulated upon imatinib-resistance was
evaluated treating R-KCL22 cells with imatinib or CX5011, respectively. As expected, higher concentration
of imatinib is required in imatinib-resistant CML cells
to counteract the constitutive activation of Bcr-Abl in
parallel with the hyper-phosphorylation of ERK1/2
and Akt Ser473, while the same concentration is quite
ineffective on the phosphorylation extent of rpS6 (Figure
3). On the contrary, CK2-inhibition strongly reduces rpS6
phosphorylation without affecting the phosphorylation
of the residues responsible for the activation of Bcr-Abl,
ERK1/2, Akt and p70S6K protein kinases (Figure 4A).
Previous studies have demonstrated that inhibition of CK2
by CX-4945 decreases rpS6 phosphorylation in oncogenic
cells as a consequence of the down-regulation of PI3K/
Akt/mTOR signalling [44, 45]. Our results showing that
CX-5011 and, under similar conditions, CX-4945 (data
not shown) do not affect the activation state of MEK/
ERK1/2 or PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathways suggest that an
alternative regulatory mechanism mediated by CK2 acts
on rpS6 phosphorylation in R-KCL22 cells. The outcome
that CK2 plays a pivotal role in the regulation of rpS6
phosphorylation is also supported by RNA interference
experiments. Knocking down CK2 subunit expression
efficiently counteracts rpS6 phosphorylation without
affecting the phosphorylation of Akt Ser473 and Thr308
and that of p70S6K Thr389 in imatinib-resistant KCL22
cells (Figure 4B).
Further studies are needed to get insight into the
molecular process underlying the CK2 involvement
in rpS6 phosphorylation in imatinib-resistant cells.
CK2-inhibition strongly reduces rpS6 phosphorylation
without affecting p70S6K, the main kinase active on this
protein in R-KCL22 cells as indicated by cell treatment
with rapamycin and PF-4708671. Therefore, we might
hypothesize that the phosphorylation of rpS6 by p70S6K
is under the control of a CK2-mediated regulatory
mechanism. In this respect, our analyses rule out the
hypotheses that CK2 might control rpS6 phosphorylation
by interacting with p70S6K (Figure 4E) or affecting the
nuclear vs cytoplasmic localization of p70S6K (Figure
4D). Moreover, our in vitro experiments demonstrate that
the ribosomal protein is not a direct target of CK2 (data
not shown). Another hypothesis is that imatinib-resistance
might trigger an alternative p70S6K-independent and
CK2-mediated pathway leading to rpS6 phosphorylation.
On this point, evidence has been provided for an additional
rpS6-phosphorylating kinase not identified so far [28].
Consistent with the role played by rpS6 in ribosome
biogenesis and translation initiation [46], our results
suggest that the hyper-phosphorylation of this protein in
CML cells strengthens the resistant leukemic phenotype
by promoting protein synthesis and cell growth. Indeed,
down-regulation of rpS6 phosphorylation induced by CK2inhibition is associated with a reduction of the protein
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

synthesis efficacy as compared to the control in both
KCL22 and K562 cells (Figure 4F). While the implication
of CK2 in the regulation of protein synthesis is generally
acknowledged [47], our results disclose a new Bcr-Ablindependent and CK2-mediated pathway associated with
imatinib-resistance, which promotes protein synthesis
thereby potentiating the CML cell survival.
The significant contribution of CK2 to the chronic
myeloid leukaemia phenotype is confirmed by the
apoptosis induction promoted by CX-5011 in KCL22
cells. We show that CX-5011 acts as a pro-apoptotic
agent and that the inhibitor concentration required to
induce apoptosis in imatinib-resistant KCL22 cells
is much lower than that effective in sensitive cell line
(Figure 5). This outcome is consistent with the concept
that resistant cells are more dependent on CK2 activity
for their survival than sensitive ones, although their CK2
level is not abnormally high. While our experiments
were performed using CML cell lines, where imatinibresistance is not associated with Bcr-Abl mutations
[18], CK2-inhibition has been described recently to
promote apoptosis induction in a human CML sample,
where imatinib-resistance is due to Bcr-Abl T315I
mutation [48].
The availability of different oncogenic targets
hyper-activated by imatinib-resistance provided a criterion
for assessing the efficacy of new drug combinations to
counteract CML resistance. We found that all the binary
associations between imatinib, U0126 and CX-5011,
a derivative of a clinical stage inhibitor of CK2, act
synergistically in reducing KCL22 and K562 cell viability.
Of special interest is the combined inhibition of Bcr-Abl,
CK2 and MEK protein kinases, which displays a potent
and synergistic anti-proliferative effect. This ternary drug
association is indeed particularly effective, restoring the
sensitivity of imatinib-resistant cells to low imatinib
concentration (Figures 6 and 7).
In conclusion, we provide evidence that imatinibresistant KCL22 and K562 cells escape the drug effect
by potentiating the cell proliferation mechanisms as
well as the pro-survival pathways through up-regulation
of ERK1/2, Akt Ser473 and rpS6 phosphorylation. We
highlight a new regulatory pathway, mediated by CK2,
involved in rpS6 phosphorylation in imatinib-resistant
CML cells. We further show that the combined inhibition
of Bcr-Abl, CK2 and MEK/ERK1/2 may afford a novel
strategy to counteract CML imatinib-resistance by means
of synergistic effects.
