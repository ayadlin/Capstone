Real-time Liquid Biopsy in Cancer Patients: Fact or Fiction?

Klaus Pantel1 and Catherine Alix-Panabie

Abstract
Distant metastases harbor unique genomic characteristics not detectable in the corresponding primary tumor
of the same patient and metastases located at different sites show a considerable intrapatient heterogeneity.
Thus, the mere analysis of the resected primary tumor alone (current standard practice in oncology) or, if possible,
even reevaluation of tumor characteristics based on the biopsy of the most accessible metastasis may not reveal
sufﬁcient information for treatment decisions. Here, we propose that this dilemma can be solved by a new
diagnostic concept: liquid biopsy, that is, analysis of therapeutic targets and drug resistance–conferring gene
mutations on circulating tumor cells (CTC) and cell-free circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) released into the
peripheral blood from metastatic deposits. We discuss the current challenges and future perspectives of CTCs and
ctDNA as biomarkers in clinical oncology. Both CTCs and ctDNA are interesting complementary technologies
that can be used in parallel in future trials assessing new drugs or drug combinations. We postulate that the liquid
biopsy concept will contribute to a better understanding and clinical management of drug resistance in patients
with cancer. Cancer Res; 73(21); 6384–8. Ó2013 AACR.

Introduction
The prognosis of patients with carcinoma, even with small
primary tumors, is mainly determined by the blood-borne
dissemination of tumor cells from the primary site to distant
organs such as bone marrow, liver, lungs, or brain and the
subsequent outgrowth of a largely unknown subset of these
cells ("metastasis-initiator cells") into overt metastases in their
new microenvironment (1). The colonization of distant organs
by disseminated tumor cells (DTC), resulting in the appearance
of clinically detectable metastases, can take many years in
breast cancer (and other solid tumors; ref. 2) and the mechanisms behind this "cancer dormancy" are largely unknown (3–5).
This stringent selection process together with a potential
independent genomic progression of DTCs may explain why
overt metastases can harbor unique genomic alterations different from the bulk of the original primary tumor cells (6–8).
Thus, the direct analysis of metastatic cells will reveal important information for systemic cancer therapy targeting metastatic disease (9, 10). However, biopsy of overt metastases is an
invasive procedure limited to certain locations and not easily
acceptable in the clinic. Moreover, recent work has shown that
different metastatic sites harbor different genomic aberrations

(11) and biopsy of one or two accessible metastases may not be
representative.
An alternative approach is the analysis of blood samples for
circulating tumor cells (CTC) or circulating tumor DNA
(ctDNA), which can be conducted repeatedly and might allow
real-time monitoring of cancer therapies in individual patients
(10). Recent reports indicated that CTCs and ctDNA give
important complementary information on therapeutic targets
and drug resistance mechanisms in patients with carcinoma
(7, 12). The peripheral blood is a pool of cells and/or DNA
derived from the primary tumor and different metastatic sites
and may, therefore, provide a comprehensive real-time picture
of the whole tumor burden in an individual patient (Fig. 1). At
present, there is an ongoing discussion whether CTCs or
ctDNA are better suitable as "liquid biopsy" (Annual ACCR
Meeting 2013, Washington, DC) and we will brieﬂy discuss the
main advantages and disadvantages of both the approaches.

CTCs
Clinical relevance and biologic implications
The detection of CTCs in the peripheral blood of patients
with solid epithelial tumors (e.g., breast, prostate, lung, and
colon cancer) holds great promise, and many exciting technologies have been developed over the past years (13). In
addition, there is a wealth of information on the clinical
validation of CTC detection and enumeration (e.g., large-scale
pooled analysis of thousands of patients with breast cancer;
ref. 14), which resulted in the inclusion of CTCs in the new
edition of the tumor–node–metastasis (TNM) cancer staging
manual in 2010 as classiﬁcation cM0(iþ). Currently, more than
400 clinical trials use CTCs as biomarkers and PubMed lists
more than 14,000 publications on CTCs. Many publications
deal with the patients in advanced stages, but there is also an
increasing number of publications on patients at earlier

disease stages without clinical and radiologic signs of overt
metastases, in particular in breast cancer (14, 15), but also in
other tumor entities such as bladder cancer (16). These publications show a signiﬁcant correlation between the CTC
counts and prognosis of patients with cancer, suggesting that
CTCs are either surrogates of metastatic activity or causally
involved in the metastatic process. Interestingly, CTCs are
observed months and years after surgical resection of the
primary tumor. Regarding the short life span of CTCs in the
circulation (17), this observation suggests that DTCs or micrometastases replenish the pool of CTCs over a long period of
time (17, 18). Thus, the analysis of these CTCs may provide
unique information about the molecular characteristics of
occult minimal residual disease (MRD) in patients with cancer
without clinically detectable overt metastases. Detection and
molecular analysis of MRD is of utmost importance for tailoring systemic adjuvant therapy aimed to prevent the progression of DTCs/micrometastases to overt metastases, but this
decision is usually based on statistical risk assessment and the
analysis of a very small sample of the primary tumor. This is a
severe limitation in view of the pronounced genomic and
phenotypic heterogeneity of the primary tumor and the fact

that metastatic cells may harbor unique molecular characteristics not detectable in the bulk of the corresponding primary
cancer cells.
Potential and challenges
However, detecting CTCs remain technically challenging.
CTCs occur at very low concentrations of one tumor cell in the
background of millions of blood cells. Their identiﬁcation and
characterization require extremely sensitive and speciﬁc analytic methods, which are usually a combination of complex
enrichment and detection procedures (9, 13, 19). In particular,
early-stage patients present with very low concentration of
CTCs and might, therefore, require more sensitive CTC assays
and/or analysis of large blood volumes (13).
Nevertheless, recent studies have documented the potential
of CTC analyses for an in-depth assessment of viable metastatic tumor cells at various levels (DNA, RNA, and proteins)
and functionally (in vitro/in vivo), including next-generation
sequencing analyses (7) and xenotransplantation of CTCs
into immunodeﬁcient mice (20). This may contribute to the
identiﬁcation of metastases-initiator cells; these cells are the
prime targets of antimetastatic therapies and they may have

developed special resistance mechanisms. At present, more
sensitive technologies are being developed, also capturing
CTCs that underwent an epithelial–mesenchymal transition
(EMT), a process linked to cancer stemness and chemotherapy
resistance (21, 22). Several studies have shown that CTCs
express various EMT-related transcription factors (e.g., Twist
and Snail) and vimentin as the typical mesenchymal intermediate ﬁlament protein (23, 24). Recently, it has been suggested
by experimental studies that CTCs "frozen" in a mesenchymal
state might not be able to form solid metastases, but these
cells need to revert to an epithelial phenotype (25). If this is also
true in patients with cancer, CTCs with the highest EMT/
mesenchymal–epithelial transition (MET) plasticity might be
the most aggressive ones, supporting both tumor cell dissemination and initiation of metastatic outgrowth.

ctDNA
Clinical relevance and biologic implications
Elevated concentrations of cell-free ctDNA fragments have
been found in blood plasma and serum of patients with cancer
with various tumor types and associated with unfavorable
outcome in some clinical studies (26). ctDNA fragments mainly
originate from apoptotic or necrotic tumor cells that discharge
their DNA into the blood circulation (26). The use of ctDNA as
an abbreviation may not be optimal and should be considered
carefully as this is likely to be adopted widely in the scientiﬁc
literature on this topic. At present, there is no way to isolate
tumor DNA speciﬁcally from other circulating DNAs and only
the detection of tumor-speciﬁc mutations on circulating cellfree DNA indicates the presence of ctDNA.
With the development of next-generation sequencing technologies, the ﬁeld of ctDNA analysis, which originally started
almost 20 years ago (27–29), has revived and focused on
genomic aberrations relevant to therapy resistance in patients
with metastatic cancer [e.g., KRAS mutations for EGF receptor
(EGFR) inhibition in colorectal cancer; ref. 30]. Besides targeting speciﬁc gene mutations, several groups have developed
assays to screen the genome of ctDNA. Leary and colleagues
analyzed four colorectal and two breast cancers with massively
parallel sequencing and revealed an average of nine rearranged
sequences (range, 4–) per tumor (31). PCR with primers
spanning the breakpoints was able to detect mutant DNA
molecules present at levels lower than 0.001% and readily
identiﬁed mutated circulating DNA in patient plasma samples.
More recently, Murtaza and colleagues have established proofof-principle that the exome-wide analysis of ctDNA can identify mutations associated with acquired drug resistance in
advanced cancers. The authors serially analyzed ctDNA for
1 to 2 years in 6 patients with cancer with very high ctDNA
concentrations in their blood plasma. Even though exome
sequencing revealed numerous mutations in ctDNA, the
authors were able to identify speciﬁc mutations in the posttherapy samples that are known to confer drug resistance (32).
In another study from the same research group, Dawson and
colleagues used targeted or whole-genome sequencing to
identify somatic genomic alterations and designed personalized assays to quantify ctDNA in serially collected plasma

6386

samples (12). ctDNA was detected in 29 of the 30 (97%) patients
with metastatic breast cancer in whom somatic genomic
alterations were identiﬁed.
Taken together, detailed genomic information relevant to
cancer therapy can be obtained from ctDNA present in the
peripheral blood of patients with cancer with advanced disease. However, it should be noted that patients with high
ctDNA concentrations were selected for these interesting
proof-of-principle studies.
Potential and challenges
Although the analysis of plasma samples (ctDNA) seems
to be more convenient than the analysis of whole blood
(CTC), preanalytic conditions for ctDNA analysis must be
also standardized (26). For example, normal DNA from dying
blood cells after blood collection will contaminate the specimens and dilute ctDNA. However, immediate plasma separation, storage, and shipment on dry ice make multicenter
trials more complicated.
Besides these technical considerations, the key question
about the biology and clinical relevance of ctDNA analyses is,
why cell-free DNA mainly released from dying tumor cells
should give important information on resistant clones? Possible hypotheses that need to be tested in future studies are
that resistant viable tumor cells may release ctDNA and/or that
a fraction of these cells might undergo apoptosis and release
fragmented ctDNA into the blood.
Studies on combined analyses of CTCs and ctDNA
Investigations on combined analyses of CTCs and cell-free
DNA have just begun and show an interesting relationship
between ctDNA and CTCs in blood and DTCs in bone marrow
of patients with cancer. Previous studies in patients with
prostate cancer showed that the presence of CTC was significantly correlated with the frequencies of LOH at certain
chromosomal loci on ctDNA (33). Another previous investigation in patients with early breast cancer indicated that both
CTC counts and ctDNA (HER2 ampliﬁcation) were predictors
of metastatic disease (34). In non–small cell lung cancer,
Maheswaran and colleagues analyzed mutations in EGFR in
CTCs and ctDNA in the same patients and concluded that
genotyping of CTCs seemed to be more sensitive than analysis
of free plasma DNA (P ¼ 0.009) and the concomitant quantiﬁcation of CTCs provided an important context in which to
interpret genotyping results (35).
In more recent studies, modern next-generation sequencing
technologies have been applied for a more in-depth genomic
analysis. Dawson and colleagues claimed that ctDNA levels
showed a more dynamic range and more correlation with
changes in tumor burden than did CTCs (12). However, they
have used the EpCAM-based CellSearch system with its known
sensitivity problems for CTC analysis. Interestingly, they could
show a good correlation between ctDNA and CTC levels in
patients with higher CTC counts, which is consistent with
other reports in colon cancer (33, 36). In patients with metastatic colon cancer (36), Heitzer and colleagues found a
signiﬁcant correlation between the detection of CTCs and the
presence of circulating DNA fragments with a particular length

that contained tumor-speciﬁc mutations (e.g., in the KRAS
gene). Comparing the sequences of DNA extracted from CTCs
with ctDNA of the same patients with colon cancer revealed
striking similarities in the few index patients analyzed (7).
However, these investigations were so far restricted to a small
group of metastatic patients with high CTC counts and ctDNA
concentrations.
Another set of comparative investigations targeted epigenetic alterations on ctDNA. In patients with advanced stage
melanoma, the number of CTCs signiﬁcantly correlated with
the methylation of cell-free RASSF1A and RAR-b2 DNA molecules and both CTC and ctDNA concentrations were prognosticators for response to therapy and clinical outcome (37).
Two other studies in patients with breast cancer also showed a
signiﬁcant correlation between cell-free methylated DNA and
the detection of CTCs and both parameters were associated
with more aggressive tumors (38, 39).
Nevertheless, a caveat needs to be added because the quoted
studies were conducted with various types of CTC and ctDNA
assays and relatively small cohorts of patients with cancer were
analyzed. Thus, larger studies with standardized assays are
required to validate these interesting preliminary ﬁndings.

metastatic cell clones located at different sites, which need to
be further explored in prospective intervention trials testing
whether changes in therapy based on ctDNA and/or CTC
analyses using standardized tests will improve patient's outcome by enabling an individualized therapy. Prospective multicenter trials have been initiated for HER2-directed therapies
(e.g., DETECT-III and EORTC-sponsored TREAT-CTC trials)
randomizing lapatinib or trastzumab based on the HER2 status
of CTCs in patients with metastatic breast cancer (41).
The outcome of the current race between CTCs and ctDNA
is open. Both CTCs and ctDNA are interesting complementary
technologies that can be used in parallel in future trials
assessing new drugs or drug combinations. Considering the
rapid developments in CTC research and sequencing technologies, it might become possible in the near future to identify the
metastasis-initiator subpopulation of CTCs by immunostaining and speciﬁcally analyze the genome of these important
cells. Sequential applications of different targeted drugs based
on real-time liquid biopsy analyses in individual patients might
become a novel strategy for personalized medicine in oncology.
We postulate that this strategy will contribute to a better
understanding and clinical management of drug resistance in
patients with cancer.

Conclusions and Perspectives
The term liquid biopsy originally introduced for the analysis
of CTCs (13) has been also used now for ctDNA analysis
(12, 30, 32). The current deﬁnition of a biopsy is, however, "the
removal of cells or tissues for examination by a pathologist"
(National Cancer Institute, NIH, Bethesda, MD). Although
this term is suitable for CTCs, it seems somewhat misleading
when applied to ctDNA, a fragmented cell component released
mainly by dying tumor cells.
Thus far, proof-of-principle data in small cohorts of metastatic patients with high CTC counts and ctDNA amounts have
been published (7, 12, 30, 40), but larger prospective trials are
needed to show clinical use. Future analysis of blood samples
from M0-patients with much lower amount of CTCs and ctDNA
will be a real challenge. Dilution with normal DNA released, for
example, from cells during infections or injuries, and mutations of tumor-associated genes in normal tissue of aging
patients and in frequent benign diseases (e.g., nevi or prostate
hyperplasia) may cause sensitivity and speciﬁcity problems.
Moreover, future studies need to show whether CTCs or
ctDNA detected in blood are representative of all relevant
