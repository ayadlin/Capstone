ABSTRACT
As a common toxic metal, lead has significant neurotoxicity to brain development.
Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) function in multiple biological processes. However,
whether lncRNAs are involved in lead-induced neurotoxicity remains unclear. Uc.173
is a lncRNA from a transcribed ultra-conservative region (T-UCR) of human, mouse
and rat genomes. We established a lead-induced nerve injury mouse model. It showed
the levels of Uc.173 decreased significantly in hippocampus tissue and serum of the
model. We further tested the expression of Uc.173 in serum of lead-exposed children,
which also showed a tendency to decrease. To explore the effects of Uc.173 on leadinduced nerve injury, we overexpressed Uc.173 in an N2a mouse nerve cell line and
found Uc.173 had an inhibitory effect on lead-induced apoptosis of N2a. To investigate
the molecular mechanisms of Uc.173 in apoptosis associated with lead-induced nerve
injury, we predicted the target microRNAs of Uc.173 by using miRanda, TargetScan
and RegRNA. After performing quantitative real-time PCR and bioinformatics analysis,
we showed Uc.173 might inter-regulate with miR-291a-3p in lead-induced apoptosis
and regulate apoptosis-associated genes. Our study suggests Uc.173 significantly
inhibits the apoptosis of nerve cells, which may be mediated by inter-regulation with
miRNAs in lead-induced nerve injury.

INTRODUCTION

neuronal apoptosis. The excessive apoptosis of nerve
cells may have a serious impact on normal development
and differentiation of the central nervous system. Studies
show that lead exposure can lead to apoptosis of nerve
cells in human and experimental animals. In recent
years, studies have indicated that long non-coding RNAs
(lncRNAs) have a very important role in the process of
carcinogenesis and damage induced by xenobiotics [4],
but the mechanism of lncRNAs in lead-induced nerve
injury has not yet been reported.
LncRNAs are a form of RNA whose length is
more than 200 nucleotides. They themselves do not
encode proteins but participate in the regulation of gene
expression and various biological processes [5]. LncRNAs
can activate or inhibit the expression of target genes by

Lead, one of the main heavy metals, is widely
distributed in the environment. Lead exposure in the living
environment harms human health; in particular, prevalence
of lead poisoning is much higher in children than in adults.
It has been suggested that lead can act as a kind of poison
with strong neural developmental toxicity [1]. Even lowlevel exposure to lead can harm the developing central
nervous system, and influence the ability of learning,
memory and neural behaviors of children. Because of
the incomplete development of the blood brain barrier
in children, when blood lead accumulates to a certain
level, it will induce irreversible injuries in the nervous
system [2, 3]. The neurotoxicity of lead is associated with

directly binding to the target genes, or be involved in
histone modification or recruitment of transcription
factors. LncRNAs also interact with microRNA (miRNA)
as a kind of competitive endogenous RNA (ceRNA) to
regulate the expression of target genes [6]. LncRNAs also
inter-regulate with miRNA as ceRNA [7].
There are 481 ultra-conservative regions (UCRs),
which share 100% identity among human, mouse and
rat genomes [8]. The lncRNAs transcribed from these
UCRs are known as transcribed ultra-conservative regions
(T-UCRs) [9]. The functions of most T-UCRs are still
unknown, but their high conservation and wide expression
in various tissues suggest they have important biological
functions. The changes of T-UCR expression irrespective
of type or amount have proven closely related to the
survival rate of human cancer patients, including chronic
lymphocytic leukemia, colon cancer, primary liver cancer
and neuroblastoma [10]. Moreover, studies show that
some T-UCRs, especially Uc.73 and Uc.338, can promote
the growth of cancer cells by acting as an oncoprotein
[11]. The studies regarding T-UCRs mainly focus on their
role in cancer, but some studies report that they could be
potential therapeutic targets [12]. However, their functions
in nerve injury induced by exogenous chemicals have not
been reported.
In our previous study, we treated PC12 cells (a cell
line derived from a pheochromocytoma of rat adrenal
medulla) with lead acetate and made lncRNA chip and RTqPCR (Reverse Transcript-quantitative PCR) analysis. We
found Uc.173 was downregulated significantly among the
differentially-expressed genes. To investigate the role of
Uc.173 in lead-induced nerve injury, we tested the changes
of the expression of Uc.173 in brain tissue, serum of leadexposed mouse as well as in the serum of lead-exposed
humans. We used N2a mouse nerve cells to further explore
the effects of Uc.173 on neuronal apoptosis induced by
lead. Our results suggest Uc.173 plays an important role in
apoptotic inhibition in lead-induced nerve injury.

Weeks 1, 2 and 5, the histopathological hematoxylineosin staining analysis of hippocampus tissues suggested
that in early stages of lead exposure, brain tissues had no
significant injuries, but showed remarkable pathological
changes in Week 5 (Figure 1B) compared with controls.
The elevation of blood lead level correlated with the
degree of brain damage.

RESULTS

To study the effects of lead exposure on the
expression of Uc.173 in nerve cells, we treated mouse
neuroblastoma N2a cells with 0.1 um/L lead acetate and
observed the changes of Uc.173 expression at various
treatment time points. We tested the expression of Uc.173
in N2a cells at five time points (0 h, 12 h, 24 h, 36 h and
48 h) after the treatment and found with the extension of
lead-exposure time, the expression of Uc.173 in N2a cells
decreased gradually. Compared with 0 h, the expression of
Uc.173 decreased by 2.4-fold in 48 h (Figure 3).

Expression of Uc.173 in the serum of the animal
model and lead-exposed population
We used RT-qPCR to test the expression of Uc.173
in the hippocampus tissues and serum of lead-exposed
mice and in the serum of lead-exposed populations.
Each group included ten mice. The animal model was
successfully established after five weeks treatment of
lead. Then we tested the expression of Uc.173 in mouse
hippocampus tissues (Figure 2A and 2B) and serum
(Figure 2C and 2D) and found the expression of Uc.173
was downregulated significantly (decreased by 2.6-fold) in
lead-treated groups compared with controls. We also tested
the level of Uc.173 in human serum. Since we mainly
investigated the lead-induced injury in the developmental
stage, we chose school-age children as study subjects.
We firstly tested the blood lead concentration in children
who lived in a selected district and were more likely to be
exposed to lead, then we chose 25 children with low-level
lead exposure as the low-lead group (less than 20 ug/L
of blood concentration) and 25 children with a high-level
lead exposure as the high-lead group (more than 80 ug/L
of blood concentration). We collected serum samples to
test the expression of Uc.173. The expression of Uc.173
was significantly downregulated (decreased by 3.1 folds)
in the high-lead group compared with the low-lead group
(Figure 2E and 2F).

Establishment of a mouse model with leadinduced brain injury
To test the changes of expression of Uc.173 during
brain injury induced by lead, we established a C57bl/6
mouse model of lead-induced brain injury. We used
inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS)
to monitor the blood lead concentration in mice. Compared
with controls, the blood lead concentration increased
slightly in Week 1 and Week 2 of the lead treatment while
it increased significantly in Week 5 (Figure 1A). The
reason for no significant increase in the first two weeks
is that it takes time for lead to accumulate in mice. In

been reported. We overexpressed Uc.173 in nerve cells
using in vitro transcription and transfection and tested the
apoptosis firstly at the cellular level. As shown in Figure
4A, the Q1-LR (Quadrant1-Low Right, representing
early-stage apoptosis in a flow cytometry test) in the leadtreated alone group was 19.4%, and in the group of Uc.173
overexpression plus lead treatment, the Q1-LR was 15.5%
(Figure 4A). Compared with being treated with lead alone,
combining Uc.173 overexpression significantly reduced
the apoptosis. This indicated that Uc.173 might have an
apoptotic inhibitory function in lead-induced nerve injury.
We used the terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase
dUTP nick‑end labeling (TUNEL) assay to further verify
the anti-apoptotic function of Uc.173. TUNEL assay in
situ detected fragmented DNA after lead treatment to
evaluate cell apoptosis. As shown in Figure 4B, a large
amount of nuclear DNAs were fragmented after 48hour lead treatment, which indicated cells experienced
significant apoptosis. Overexpressing Uc.173 for six hours
combined with 48-hour lead treatment decreased DNA
fragmentation significantly. The result of TUNEL assay
also supported the anti-apoptotic effect of Uc.173 on leadinduced nerve injury.

We then tested the expression of caspase 3 and
caspase 9, key members in the apoptotic pathway, by
assessing protein levels with a western blot. We tested
the control group, the lead-treatment alone group and
the Uc.173-overexpressed plus lead-treatment group,
respectively. As shown in Figure 4C and 4D, compared
with the control group, the expression of caspase 3 in the
lead-treatment alone group increased significantly. The
overexpression of Uc.173 made the expression recover
to a level similar to the control. However, the expression
of caspase 9 in these three groups was not significantly
different. Despite the fact that caspase 9 can regulate
the expression of caspase 3, other mechanisms may also
participate in the regulation of caspase 3. The difference in
the expression of caspase 9 and caspase 3 in lead-induced
nerve injury suggested other factors might affect the
expression of caspase 3 during this process. In conclusion,
we confirmed the anti-apoptotic function of Uc.173 in
lead-induced nerve injury at the protein level.

* Represents nine target miRNAs with the highest potential predicted by miRanda and TargetScan, and analyzed using
RegRNA platform.

Identification of target miRNAs and genes

we analyzed the miRNAs using the RegRNA platform
[14]. By analyzing the seed sequence, we obtained nine
miRNAs which were most likely to be the target miRNAs
of Uc.173 (miR-186-5p, miR-208a-5p, miR-291a-3p,
miR-294-3p, miR-295-3p, miR-302a-3p, miR-302b-3p,
miR-302c-3p and miR-302d-3p). We then used qPCR to
validate their expression further. When compared with
the lead-treatment alone group, qPCR suggested that

Studies have shown that there is inter-regulation
between T-UCR and miRNA. T-UCR can play a regulatory
function through the mediation of miRNA [13]. To identify
the potential target miRNAs of Uc.173, we used miRanda
and TargetScan. Thirty-four miRNAs were predicted by
both software (Table 1). To further screen the miRNAs,

eight miRNAs (miR-208a-5p, miR-291a-3p, miR-294-3p,
miR-295-3p, miR-302a-3p, miR-302b-3p, miR-302c-3p
and miR-302d-3p) in the Uc.173-overexpressed plus leadtreatment group were downregulated (Figure 5). Analysis
of miRSystem revealed among the eight miRNAs, four
miRNAs (miR-291a-3p, miR-295-3p, miR-302b-3p and
miR-302d-3p) have apoptosis-associated target genes
(PI3K, NIK and Cn) or a DNA-damage repair-associated
target gene (RAD23B). These target genes are all key
regulatory factors in the apoptotic pathway. Among these
four miRNAs, only miR-291a-3p was upregulated in
the lead-treatment alone group, in which the expression
of Uc.173 was actually downregulated. Based on the
bioinformatics analysis and the prediction of target genes,
we propose that Uc.173 likely inhibits apoptosis through
the mediation of miR-291a-3p, which needs further studies
to verify.

test tools, lead poisoning cannot be diagnosed until
blood lead accumulates to a certain level and irreversible
damage has already been generated [15]. The mechanisms
of lead-induced nerve injury have been a hotspot for
many years in the field of exogenous chemical-induced
neurotoxicity, but the associated mechanisms are still not
fully understood. Lots of studies indicate that lead-induced
apoptosis is an important event during nerve injury caused
by lead [16]. Current studies concentrate on the effects
of protein-coding genes in this process; the roles of noncoding genes have been largely overlooked.
The majority of lncRNAs are transcribed by RNA
polymerase II. The RNA molecules do not encode proteins
due to the lack of open reading frames. LncRNAs are a
kind of evolutionarily-conserved RNA molecule whose
expression is dynamic and varies with the environment.
Compared with protein-coding genes, lncRNAs have tissue
and developmental specificity [17]. LncRNAs, including
T-UCRs, have very important biological functions. The
expressional type and amount of T-UCRs proved closely
related to the survival rate of cancer patients [18]. T-UCRs
can be used as markers for cancer diagnosis and prognosis,
and have become potential targets for cancer therapy [19].
The functional mechanisms of lncRNAs are complicated
and the role of lncRNAs in lead-induced nerve injury
has not been reported. To explore whether T-UCRs may
be involved in neuronal apoptosis induced by lead, we

DISCUSSION
Lead is an important heavy metal in the
environment. Exposure to lead threatens human health
and can influence the intellectual development of
children significantly, which mainly presents as learning
and memory disorders [2]. Diagnosis of lead poisoning
depends on biochemical indices, including blood lead,
hair lead and urine lead. However, due to the limits of

chose Uc.173, a T-UCR selected from a lncRNA chip in
our previous screen, to study their molecular function in
lead-induced neuronal apoptosis. We detected Uc.173 in
a lead-induced mouse nerve injury model as well as in
lead-exposed populations. The results showed that the
expression of Uc.173 in the process of lead-induced nerve
injury was significantly reduced.
Studies indicate that lead can induce the apoptosis
of nerve cells in the hippocampus and cerebral cortex of
developing and mature rats [20]. Cell apoptosis is a kind
of programmed death controlled by genes [21], which is
important for the maintenance of body homeostasis and
the normal development of the nervous system. Apoptosis
is also associated with diseases. Excessive apoptosis may
harm normal nerve function. We explored the function
of Uc.173 in lead-induced neural apoptosis from the
cell, DNA and protein level. We treated N2a cells with
lead acetate (PbAc) and found the expression of Uc.173
in the lead-exposed cells declined with time. We further
overexpressed Uc.173 in N2a cells and then used FCM
to detect the apoptosis at the cellular level and analyzed
broken DNA using a TUNEL assay at the DNA level. The
results of both methods suggested that apoptosis in leadtreated alone cells increased significantly. Overexpression
of Uc.173 significantly weakened the apoptosis induced
by lead treatment, which again favored the anti-apoptotic
effect of Uc.173.
Cell apoptosis is regulated by a set of genes and is
accompanied by changes in the expression of associated
proteins [22], so we further investigated the anti-apoptotic
function of Uc.173 at the protein level. The cascade
reaction induced by the caspase cysteine protease family
is the key event in the process of cell apoptosis. The
activation of caspase is mediated by the mitochondrial
dependent pathway and death receptor-mediated signaling
pathway. The activated downstream caspases lead to cell
apoptosis by cleaving specific substrates [23]. Caspase 3,
a member of the caspase family which has been studied
relatively thoroughly, is considered a key protease
in apoptosis [24]. After being activated, it triggers a
downstream cascade reaction to induce apoptosis. Caspase
3 exists in an inactive proenzyme before activation and is
activated through being cleaved by multiple proteolytic
enzymes [25]. Caspases can be activated through multiple
ways; for example, caspase 9 can activate caspase 3, and
caspase 3 in turn activates caspase 9 to form a positive
feedback [25]. We used western blotting to detect the
expression of caspase 3 and caspase 9 at the protein level.
The expression of caspase 3 but not caspase 9 showed
significant difference. This suggested Uc.173 may inhibit
apoptosis by regulating the expression of caspase 3, and
there should be other ways (not caspase 9) to activate
caspase 3 in the process. In summary, we verified the
anti-apoptotic function of Uc.173 from the cell, DNA and
protein level.
Calin et al. [13] found that T-UCRs were associated
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

with the negative regulation of miRNAs in leukemia
and high-risk neuroblastoma cells and investigated the
interaction of T-UCRs and miRNAs. A T-UCR is one
of the lncRNAs, and researches show that lncRNAs
play a role in regulating downstream target miRNA as
ceRNA. They found T-UCRs and miRNAs could interregulate each other. Mestdagh et al. [26] deeply studied
the initiation and regulation of T-UCR and miRNA
transcription and found both of the non-coding RNAs
had similar transcription characteristics. Jiang et al. [18]
found the expression of some T-UCRs was negatively
correlated with miRNA expression. Scaruffi et al. [27]
suggested that a deregulation of the miRNA/T-UCR
network may play an important role in the pathogenesis of
neuroblastoma. Sana J et al. [11] found uc.73 to influence
apoptosis in colon cancer cells, and uc.338 to inhibit the
growth of hepatocellular carcinoma cells. Using target
gene prediction plus qPCR testing, we discovered that in
apoptosis induced by lead, Uc.173 potentially regulated
apoptosis through the mediation of miR-291a-3p.
In conclusion, Uc.173, a T-UCR, plays an important
role in lead-induced neuronal apoptosis. Our study reveals
a new mechanism of lead-induced nerve injury.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Construction of lead-induced mouse brain injury
model
A batch of 60 ablactating C57bl/6 mice (three weeks
old) with a weight range of 10-12 g were purchased from
the Medical Animal Experimental Center of Guangdong,
China and fed in the specific pathogen free (SPF) animal
room of Laboratory Animal Center of Guangzhou Medical
University, China. The temperature was 20-26 °C and the
relative humidity was 40%-70%. The light/dark cycle was
12/12 hours. After a three-day adaptation, the C57bl/6
mice were randomly divided into control group (sterile
water, n = 30) and lead acetate-treatment group (lead
acetate solution, n = 30). Each cage fed five mice. The
mice in the lead acetate-treatment group were fed with
drinking water containing 9.6 mmol/L lead acetate. The
mice in the two groups were sacrificed after 1, 2 and 5
weeks treatment of lead acetate (ten mice/group/time
point). All processes involving experimental animals
were approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee
of Guangzhou Medical University. The whole blood of
the mice was collected and blood lead concentration was
tested by Agilent 7700C ICP-MS (Agilent, Santa Clara,
CA, USA). Pathological examination by HE staining was
performed on sacrificed mice in the two groups.

animal model and human was 2-ΔCt, and in the cellular
model it was 2-ΔΔCt.

Construction and transfection of overexpression
vector

Study subjects were the students from an elementary
school in Guangzhou City. The area where the school
is located may be lead polluted due to the intensive
distribution of lead-associated plants. A total of 200
students in grade 1, 2 or 3 took the blood lead test. In the
meantime, the serum samples were collected for Uc.173
detection. All the students’ parents signed the informed
consent document. We isolated serum and detected
blood lead concentration in December, 2014. We asked
the children subsumed about their medical history and
excluded children with poor compliance. Children with
low blood lead concentration (less than 20 ng/L) and with
high blood lead concentration (more than 80 ng/L) were
paired up for the study.

Extraction of genomic DNA, culture of receptor
bacteria and preparation of competent cells were performed
before the construction of the vector. The construction of
the vector included the amplification of target fragments,
linkage of amplified fragments with pGEM-T Easy-Uc.173
(Biosense, Guangzhou, China) vectors and transfection of
competent cells. Transformation: 200 μL of competent
cell suspension, previously stored at -80 °C, was thawed
in an ice bath. Ligation products were added, mixed
gently and placed on ice for 30 minutes. The cells were
heat shocked for 80 seconds in a water bath at 42 °C and
immediately placed on ice for 3-5 minutes. One milliliter
LB liquid medium (Not containing ampicillin (Amp)),
was added to the tube, mixed and incubated for 1 hour
at 37 °C. One hundred micro liters of bacterial solution
was spread onto the screen plate containing Amp and
incubated at 37 °C for 16-24 hours. Positive clones were
analyzed using electrophoresis and then sequenced and
transcribed to RNA. The transfection system contained:
12 µl EndoFectin-Lenti (Gene Copoeia, Rockville, MD,
USA) 1 µg Uc.173, 200 µl Dulbecco minimum essential
medium (DMEM) without serum. Twenty-four hours after
transfection, PCR was performed to evaluate transfection
efficiency.

Construction of lead-exposed nerve cell model
The cellular model was constructed by treating
mouse N2a nerve cells with 0.1 μm/L lead acetate solution
for 48 hours.

Extraction of RNA
The total RNAs (including lncRNAs) of mouse
hippocampus tissue were extracted using TRIzol Reagent
(Invitrogen, Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA). The
hippocampus tissue was placed in a 1.5 ml centrifuge tube
containing 300 µl TRIzol reagent and ground to a paste
using an electric micro-tissue homogenizer. TRIzol (700
µl) was added and the grinding continued. After this, the
homogenate samples were placed at room temperature
for 5 minutes to completely separate the DNA-protein
complex. The extraction of total RNAs was performed
by following the manufacturer’s protocol. The quality
and concentration of extracted RNAs were measured
by a NanoDrop1000 Spectrophotometer (NanoDrop
Technologies, Wilmington, DE, USA). The total RNAs
in mouse serum and human serum were extracted using
TRIzol LS (Invitrogen). TRIzol LS Reagent (300 µl;
Invitrogen) was added into 100 µl serum and fully mixed.
After placing at room temperature for 5 minutes, the total
RNAs were extracted according to the TRIzol LS manual.

Detection of apoptosis by flow cytometry (FCM)
Annexin V-Fluorescein Isothiocyanate Apoptosis
Detection Kit (KeyGen Biotech, Nanjing, China) was
used to detect cell apoptosis. The cells were digested
by non-ethylene diamine tetra acetic acid (EDTA)containing trypsin 48 hours after transfection and the
treatment of lead, and then centrifuged (300 × g, 4 °C,
5 min). Approximately 1-5 × 105 cells were collected
and resuspended in 100 µl 1×Binding Buffer (KeyGen
Biotech). Annex in V-FITC (5 µl KeyGen Biotech) and
5 µl PI Staining Solution (KeyGen Biotech) were added
and mixed gently. The reaction lasted for 10 minutes under
room-temperature in a light-proof environment. Four
hundred micro liters of 1×Binding Buffer was added and
mixed gently. FCM was performed within one hour using
a flow cytometer (BD Biosciences, NJ, USA). Annexin
V-FITC+PI- quadrant represented early apoptotic cells
(LR); Annexin V-FITC-PI+ quadrant represented necrotic
cells (UL); Annexin V-FITC+PI+ quadrant represented
late apoptotic and necrotic cells (UR); Annexin V-FITCPI- quadrant represented live cells (LL). Finally, the ratio
of apoptotic cells accounting for total cells was calculated.

Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR)
A Prime-Script RT reagent Kit (TaKaRa, Dalian,
China) was used to reverse transcribe RNAs to cDNAs.
PCR was performed using SYBR Premix Ex Taq
(TaKaRa). The primers of internal control genes and
specific primers are shown in supplementary Table 1. The

Detection of apoptosis by TUNEL assay

MiRNA prediction and detection

TUNEL apoptosis detection kit (Roche, Basel,
Switzerland) was used to detect apoptosis. The cells were
adherently cultured on a Lab-Tek slide. After treatment
with lead acetate, the slide was washed twice with PBS.
The sample was fixed using 4% polyformaldehyde at room
temperature for 20 minutes and washed twice (5 minutes
each time) with PBS. The prepared TUNEL reaction
mixture was dropped onto the cover slip and covered by
a cover glass. The section was incubated at 37 °C for 60
minutes and washed in PBS for three times (5 minutes
each time). Converter-Peroxidase (POD) solution was
added and incubated at 37 °C for 30 minutes, and then
washed in PBS for three times (5 minutes each time).
Staining was performed using Diaminobenzidine (DAB)
stain kit (Roche) at room temperature for 10 minutes,
and was then washed in PBS for 5 minutes three times.
The section was counterstained with hematoxylin for ten
seconds and rinsed with water. The section was dehydrated
with gradient alcohol, then dried and mounted with
neutral gum. The section was observed under an optical
microscope. Brown-stained nuclei represented positive
staining. Blue-stained nuclei represented counterstaining
by hematoxylin.

MiRanda and TargetScan were used to predict the
target miRNAs of Uc.173. Default parameters of the
software were applied and the results were not filtered.
Only miRNAs predicted by both software were reserved
and analyzed using the RegRNA platform. The expression
of the miRNAs was detected by qRT-PCR. The 2-ΔΔCT
method was used for relative quantification.

Data analysis
SPSS17.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) was
used for data analysis. One-way ANOVA was used to
compare the following three differences: the expression of
Uc.173 in lead-exposed N2a cells, the gray values of the
expression of the proteins, and the expression of miRNAs
in lead-exposed nerve cells. A paired t-test was used to
compare the difference of lead concentration in tissue or
serum in the lead-induced nerve injury animal model. A
Mann-Whitney test was used to compare the difference of
serum lead concentration in different populations. A value
of P < 0.05 represents a statistically significant difference
and P < 0.01 represents a highly statistically significant
difference.

Detection of apoptotic proteins by western blot

ACKNOWLEDGMENTS

A total protein extraction kit (KeyGen Biotech,
Nanjing, China) was used to extract total protein.
Procedures were followed according to the kit manual. The
OD (optical density) values of the samples were measured
using Coomassie Brilliant Blue G250. The concentrations
of the protein of the samples were adjusted to be the same
level (4-8 µg/µl). Bio-Rad (Hercules, California, USA)
standard wet transfer apparatus and Poly vinylidene
fluoride membrane (PVDF) (Merck Millipore, Darmstadt,
German) were used to transfer the proteins from the gel to
the membrane. A constant flow (200 mA) was applied in
the process of transfer and the transfer time was 60-120
minutes according to the molecular weight of the target
proteins. The membrane was placed into TBST after
transfer and rinsed for 1-2 minutes. Blocking buffer, which
contained 5% skimmed milk powder, was added to block
at room temperature for 60 minutes. The PVDF membrane
was incubated in blocking buffer which contained
corresponding primary antibody at 4 °C overnight. The
membrane was washed with TBST three times for 5
minutes each. Then the PVDF membrane was incubated
in blocking buffer which contained the diluted secondary
antibody at room temperature for 1 hour, then washed with
TBST three times for 15 minutes each. A Beyo ECL Plus
chemiluminescence kit (Beyotime, Shanghai, China) was
used for staining in a darkroom. Finally, routine exposure
and development were performed using X-ray film.
