Abstract
Cells that sustain double-strand breaks (DSB) can develop genomic instability, which contributes to carcinogenesis, and
agents that cause DSBs are considered potential carcinogens.
We looked for evidence of acid-induced DNA damage, including DSBs, in benign Barrett's epithelial (BAR-T) cell lines
in vitro and in patients with Barrett's esophagus in vivo. In
BAR-T cells, we also explored the mechanisms underlying
acid-induced DNA damage. We exposed BAR-T cells to acid
in the presence of a fluorescent probe for reactive oxygen species (ROS) and in the presence or absence of disodium 4,4′diisothiocyanatostilbene-2,2′-disulfonate (which prevents
intracellular acidification) and N-acety-L-cysteine (a scavenger of ROS). DSBs were detected by Western blotting and
immunofluorescence for histone H2AX phosphorylation and
by CometAssay. During endoscopy in patients with Barrett's
esophagus, we took biopsy specimens from the metaplastic
mucosa before and after esophageal perfusion with 0.1 N
HCl for 3 min and sought DSBs by Western blotting for histone H2AX phosphorylation. In BAR-T cells, acid exposure resulted in ROS production and caused a time-dependent
increase in levels of phospho-H2AX that continued for at least
48 h. Pretreatment with disodium 4,4′-diisothiocyanatostilbene-2,2′-disulfonate or N-acety-L-cysteine prevented the acid-induced increase in phospho-H2AX levels. DSBs also were
detected in biopsy specimens of Barrett's metaplasia following
esophageal acid perfusion in all of 6 patients with Barrett's
esophagus. Acid exposure causes DSBs in Barrett's epithelial
cells through ROS produced as a consequence of intracellular
acidification. These findings suggest that acid can be considered a carcinogen in Barrett's esophagus. [Cancer Res 2009;69

Introduction
In the last three decades, the incidence of esophageal adenocarcinoma has increased >6-fold in the United States (1). The major risk factors for this lethal cancer are gastroesophageal reflux
disease and Barrett's esophagus, the condition in which a metaplastic columnar epithelium replaces esophageal squamous epithelium that has been damaged by gastroesophageal reflux
disease. Carcinogenesis in Barrett's metaplasia involves the accumulation of genetic and epigenetic abnormalities that cause genomic instability (2–6). It has been proposed that acid reflux
promotes carcinogenesis in Barrett's esophagus, but it is not clear

how, or even if, acid exposure contributes to genomic instability
in Barrett's epithelial cells (7).
Several studies have found that cells exposed to acid can develop
DNA damage that might result in genomic instability (8–13).
Double-strand breaks (DSB) are among the most pernicious forms
of DNA damage (14, 15). Cells with persistent DSBs have been found
to develop chromosomal abnormalities, such as translocations and
deletions, which can contribute to genomic instability and cancer
formation (14, 15). Indeed, agents that cause DSBs, such as ionizing
radiation and UV light, can be considered carcinogens (15, 16).
Clemons and colleagues have reported that protracted acid exposure results in DSBs in certain Barrett's cell lines and SEG-1 cancer
cells, which originally were alleged to be a Barrett's cancer cell line
but which recently were discovered to be nonesophageal in origin
(17). In the single nondysplastic Barrett's cell line (QhTERT) used in
that study, however, it is not clear whether the DSBs were the direct
result of acid injury to DNA or merely a consequence of the marked
(60%) increase in cell death induced by the protracted acid exposure (17). This distinction is critically important in determining
whether acid is a potential carcinogen in Barrett's esophagus. During apoptosis, the cell destroys itself by inflicting severe DNA damage, which includes DSBs. If the sequence of events induced by acid
in Barrett's cells is apoptosis followed by DSBs, then acid would not
be considered a carcinogen because DSBs in a dying cell cannot
contribute to carcinogenesis. If, on the other hand, acid causes
DSBs directly, without causing cell death, then the DSBs could persist and acid could well be a carcinogen in Barrett's esophagus.
Cellular DNA damage–sensing molecules, such as Chk2 and p53,
become activated in response to DNA injury. That activation halts
cell cycle progression to allow the cell to repair the damaged DNA
before it is replicated (14, 18, 19). We have reported that, in response to acid exposure, nonneoplastic Barrett's epithelial cell
lines activate Chk2 and p53 and exhibit a delay in cell cycle progression (20, 21). We also showed that a 10-min acid exposure did
not affect the viability of BAR-T cells and produced only a trivial
(1.1%) increase in apoptosis (20). Those observations suggest that
acid directly damages DNA in Barrett's esophagus, in which case
acid might be a carcinogen. To explore that possibility, we looked
for evidence of acid-induced DNA damage, including DSBs, in nonneoplastic Barrett's epithelial cell lines and in biopsy specimens of
Barrett's metaplasia that were taken from patients whose Barrett's
esophagus had been perfused with acid during an endoscopic examination. We also explored the molecular mechanisms underlying acid-induced DNA injury in our Barrett's cell lines using agents
that inhibit intracellular acidification and agents that scavenge reactive oxygen species (ROS).

long-segment Barrett's esophagus (specialized intestinal metaplasia involving ≥3 cm of the distal esophagus) without dysplasia who were
scheduled for elective endoscopic examinations were invited to participate in the study. All patients were male, their average ± SE age was
64.8 ± 2.4 years, and all were on treatment with proton pump inhibitors.
During endoscopy, six biopsy specimens of Barrett's metaplasia were
taken using a jumbo biopsy forceps (Olympus FB-50K-1) before and after
perfusion of the distal esophagus with 10 mL of 0.1 N HCl over 3 min as
described previously by our laboratory (22).
Cell culture. We used three nonneoplastic, telomerase-immortalized
Barrett's epithelial cell lines (BAR-T, BAR-T9, and BAR-T10) that were created in our laboratory from endoscopic biopsy specimens of nondysplastic
Barrett's specialized intestinal metaplasia taken from 3 patients with long
segment Barrett's esophagus (20, 23, 24). All of the BAR cell lines were cocultured with a fibroblast feeder layer as described previously (25). Cells
were maintained in monolayer culture at 37°C in humidified air with 5%
CO2 in growth medium as described previously (23). For individual experiments, cells were equally seeded into collagen IV–coated wells (BD Bio‐
sciences) and maintained in growth medium. We selected to use the
BAR-T line for all experiments (unless otherwise indicated) because this
line has been extensively characterized by our laboratory (20, 21, 23, 24, 26).
Acid exposure and inhibition of intracellular acidification. For individual experiments, the cells were cultured either in neutral full growth medium (pH 7.2) or in acidic full growth medium (brought to a pH of 4.0 with 1
mol/L HCl). Neutral or acidic medium was added for 10 min to equally seeded wells of BAR cells and then removed and replaced with neutral pH medium for the remainder of the experiment unless otherwise indicated. The
pH levels and durations of acid exposure were chosen to simulate typical
episodes of gastroesophageal reflux in gastroesophageal reflux disease patients (27). In experiments designed to prevent the intracellular acidification
of cells exposed to acidic medium, cells were pretreated with 500 μmol/L
disodium 4,4′-diisothiocyanatostilbene-2,2′-disulfonate (DIDS; Sigma). The
DIDS was dissolved in 0.1 mol/L KHCO3 as a 100× stock solution, and cells
were treated for 15 min before acid exposure.
Detection of intracellular ROS. Equally seeded wells of cells were
washed twice with HBSS (Invitrogen) and incubated with 10 μmol/L of a
5-(and -6)-carboxy-2′,7′-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (Molecular
Probes) probe for 20 min at 37°C in the dark. Cells were exposed to neutral
or acidic medium containing the probe for 10 min, after which the medium
was removed and replaced with neutral pH medium containing the probe.
After 30 min, cells were then washed twice with HBSS to remove any excess
probe and placed in PBS, and fluorescent intensity was immediately detected
using flow cytometry. To determine the specificity of the probe for ROS, cells
were pretreated for 30 min with 10 mmol/L N-acety-L-cysteine (NAC; Sigma),
which increases cellular pools of free radical scavengers, before incubation
with 5-(and -6)-carboxy-2′,7′-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate.
Neutral and alkaline single-cell gel electrophoresis (CometAssay)
for DNA damage. We detected DNA damage using an alkaline and neutral
CometAssay (Trevigen) per the manufacturer's instructions. The alkaline
assay detects single-stranded breaks, DSBs, apurinic and apyrimidinic sites,
and alkali labile DNA adducts. If the assay is done at neutral conditions
(without the alkaline buffer), then it mainly detects DSBs (28). We mixed
acid-exposed or control cells (100,000/mL) with melted LMAgarose at 37°C
in a ratio of 1:10 and then layered 75 μL of the mixture onto a CometSlide.
The slide was maintained at 4°C for 10 min for gelling and then immersed
in Lysis Solution at 4°C for 45 min. For the alkaline assay, the slide was
placed in Alkali Unwinding Solution for 45 min at room temperature in
the dark; this step was eliminated for the neutral CometAssay. The slide
was then placed in alkaline solution or TBE (for the neutral CometAssay)
and electrophoresis was conducted for 80 min at 1 V/cm and 315 mA at 4°C
for the alkaline CometAssay or 20 min at 1 V/cm and 6 mA at 4°C for the
neutral CometAssay. After the electrophoresis, slides were dipped in 70%
ethanol for 5 min and allowed to air dry. Slides were then stained with
silver staining or SYBR Green I solution and comet “tails” were visualized
with a light microscope (Olympus) or fluorescence microscope (Nikon), respectively. All CometAssays were done in duplicate. The comet extent tail
moment values were quantitated from slides stained with SYBR Green

using the CometScore software (TriTek) from a minimum of 50 individual
cells. This parameter measures the smallest detectable size of migrating
DNA, as indicated by the tail length, and the number of broken DNA pieces,
as indicated by the intensity of the DNA stain in the tail (28). BAR-T cells
growing in culture served as negative controls; BAR-T cells treated with 200
μmol/L hydrogen peroxide served as positive controls.
Western blotting and immunofluorescence. For the phospho-H2AX
Western blots, cells were exposed to neutral or acidic medium for 1.5, 3, or
10 min, after which the acidic medium was removed and the cells washed in
cold PBS and immediately lysed. For the phospho-H2AX time-course Western blots, cells were exposed to neutral or acidic medium for 10 min, after
which the acidic medium was removed and replaced with neutral medium
for 15 min, 30 min, 1 h, 2 h, 4 h, 6 h, 24 h, or 48 h. Cells were then washed in
cold PBS followed by immediate cell lysis. Cells were lysed in 1× cell lysis
buffer (Cell Signaling Technology). The biopsy specimens were lysed in buffer
containing 150 mmol/L NaCl, 1% NP-40, 1% deoxycholate, 20 mmol/L
Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1 mmol/L EDTA, 1 mmol/L EGTA, 2.5 mmol/L sodium
pyrophosphate, 1 mmol/L β-glycerophosphate, 1 mmol/L sodium orthovanadate, 1 μg/mL leupeptin, 1 or 0.1 mmol/L phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride,
and one Protease Inhibitor Cocktail Tablet per 50 mL lysis buffer (Roche Applied Science). Equal amounts of protein were separated by SDS-PAGE; protein concentrations were determined using the BCA-200 Protein Assay kit
(Pierce). After separation and transfer to nitrocellulose membranes, the
membranes were incubated with primary antibodies (1:1,000 dilutions) to
phospho-H2AX (Cell Signaling Technology). Horseradish peroxidase secondary antibodies were used and chemiluminescence was determined using the
Super Signal West Dura Detection System (Pierce); β-actin (Sigma) was used
to confirm equal loading. All Western blots were done in duplicate.
For the phospho-H2AX immunofluorescence assays, cells were exposed
to neutral or acidic medium for 10 min after which the medium was removed and the cells were immediately fixed with cold methanol (−20°C)
for 10 min at -20°C followed by incubation in 3% bovine serum albumin
in PBS for 45 min to block the nonspecific binding sites. Primary antibody
to phospho-H2AX (1:500 dilution) was added for 1 h at room temperature.
Secondary antibodies were conjugated with Alexa Fluor 488 and used at
1:1,000 dilutions of goat anti-rabbit for phospho-H2AX. Specificity was determined by omitting the primary antibody from the incubation. The slides
were counterstained with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole for analysis. BART cells treated with 200 μmol/L hydrogen peroxide for 10 min served as a
positive control for phospho-H2AX.
Statistical analyses. The data were collected from at least three independent experiments. Quantitative data are expressed as mean ± SE. Statistical analysis was done using ANOVA and the Student's-Newman-Keuls'
multiple-comparison test with the Instat for Windows statistical software
package (GraphPad Software). P values < 0.05 were considered significant
for all analyses.

alkaline conditions, which detects single-strand breaks and DSBs,
apurinic and apyrimidinic sites, and alkali-labile DNA adducts by
the presence of comet “tails” (28). We found that acid exposure
induced a significant increase in damaged DNA fragments detected in the comet “tails” in BAR-T cells (Fig. 2A and B).
Acid exposure causes DSBs in Barrett's epithelial cells. BART cells were treated with a single, 10-min acid exposure, and DNA
damage was assessed using the CometAssay at neutral conditions,
which detects primarily DSBs. We found that acid exposure induced a significant increase in damaged DNA fragments detected
in the comet “tails,” suggesting that acid causes DSBs in BAR-T
cells (Fig. 3A and B).
Recently, the detection of histone H2AX phosphorylation has
been found to be more sensitive assay than the CometAssay for
detecting DSBs in live cells (16, 30, 31). To confirm our findings
from the CometAssay, we treated the BAR-T cells with a single,
1.5-, 3-, or 10-min acid exposure and performed Western blotting
for phospho-H2AX expression. We found that acid exposure induced a time-dependent increase in phospho-H2AX expression
(Fig. 4A). We then determined the effect of a single, 10-min acid
exposure on phospho-H2AX expression in two additional telomerase-immortalized metaplastic Barrett's cell lines (BAR-T9 and

Results
Acid exposure generates ROS in Barrett's epithelial cells. In
earlier experiments, we found that a single, 3-min acid exposure
(pH 4.0) induces ROS production in BAR-T cells (29). To determine
the effect of a single 10-min acid exposure (pH 4.0) on ROS production, we incubated BAR-T cells with 5-(and -6)-carboxy-2′,7′dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate and determined fluorescence after acid exposure using flow cytometry. We found that
a 10-min acid exposure significantly increased ROS production
in BAR-T cells (Fig. 1). To confirm this finding, BAR-T cells incubated with 5-(and -6)-carboxy-2′,7′-dichlorodihydrofluorescein
diacetate were treated with a single, 10-min exposure to acidic medium in the presence of 10 mmol/L NAC, a general scavenger of
ROS. NAC treatment significantly decreased ROS levels (Fig. 1).

We next sought to determine the duration for which H2AX remains phosphorylated in response to acid exposure. We found that
phospho-H2AX expression persisted for up to 48 h after a single,

an increase in expression, phospho-H2AX also localizes to the sites

Barrett's epithelial cells, we studied the effects of DIDS on DSBs in
acid-treated BAR-T cells. We treated BAR-T cells with a single, 10min exposure to acidic medium in the presence of 500 μmol/L DIDS
and assessed DSBs by phospho-H2AX expression. We found that
DIDS prevented the acid-induced increase in phospho-H2AX, suggesting that intracellular acidification is the mechanism whereby
acid exposure causes DSBs in Barrett's epithelial cells (Fig. 6A).
NAC prevents DSBs in Barrett's epithelial cells exposed to
acid. To determine whether the acid-induced ROS caused the
DSBs, we treated BAR-T cells with a single, 10-min exposure to
acidic medium in the presence of 10 mmol/L NAC and assessed
for DSBs by determining phospho-H2AX expression. NAC pre-

vented the acid-induced increase in phospho-H2AX expression,
suggesting that the ROS produced in response to acid exposure
are responsible for inducing DSBs in BAR-T cells (Fig. 6A).
Esophageal acid exposure causes DSBs in patients with
Barrett's esophagus. Having found that acid exposure increases
phosphorylation of H2AX in three Barrett's epithelial cell lines,
we sought to confirm that these same effects occur in vivo by
obtaining endoscopic biopsy specimens of Barrett's epithelium before and after esophageal acid perfusion in 6 patients with Barrett's
esophagus. In agreement with our in vitro data, we found that
acid increased phospho-H2AX expression in biopsy specimens of
Barrett's metaplasia from all 6 patients (Fig. 6B).

Discussion
We have shown that acid exposure induces DNA damage, including DSBs, in Barrett's epithelial cells both in vitro and in vivo.
In BAR-T cells, we have shown evidence of acid-induced DNA damage by CometAssays performed under neutral and alkaline conditions, by H2AX phosphorylation, and by the demonstration of
nuclear foci containing phospho-H2AX. We have found that
H2AX phosphorylation increases immediately after acid exposure
and continues even up to 48 h and that phosphorylation increases
with the duration of acid exposure.
To explore whether the induction of DSBs by acid is a general
feature of Barrett's epithelial cells or a unique feature of BAR-T
cells, we studied two additional telomerase-immortalized
Barrett's epithelial cell lines that had been established in our laboratory (24). We found that acid exposure caused an increase in
the phosphorylation of H2AX in all three Barrett's cell lines, suggesting that DNA vulnerability to acid is a common property of
nonneoplastic BAR-T cells. In confirmation of these in vitro experiments, we found evidence of DSBs by H2AX phosphorylation
in biopsy specimens of Barrett's metaplasia taken from all of 6
patients who had the esophagus perfused with acid during endoscopic examinations. In cultures of esophageal cells (including
rabbit esophageal squamous cells, primary cultures of Barrett's
epithelial cells, and BAR-T cells), extracellular acid has been
found to cause intracellular acidification through activation of
the Na+-independent Cl−/HCO3− exchanger, which can be inhibited by DIDS (32, 33).3 Our finding that DIDS prevents phospho-H2AX production in BAR-T cells exposed to acid suggests
that it is intracellular acidification that mediates the generation
of DSBs.
Several lines of evidence suggested to us that ROS would be involved in the DSBs induced by acid exposure in Barrett's epithelial
cells. For example, several studies have shown that esophageal
epithelial cells exposed to acid and bile salts increased their production of ROS (13, 34–37). In an earlier study, we also found that a
3-min acid exposure significantly increased ROS production in
BAR-T cells (29). ROS are well known to cause oxidative damage
to DNA (38, 39), and biopsy specimens of Barrett's metaplasia have
been found to exhibit evidence of oxidative DNA injury (11–13).
Moreover, ROS have been shown to cause DSBs. Cultures of fibroblasts from SOD1 transgenic mice, which have abnormally high levels of endogenous ROS production, develop more DSBs than
fibroblasts from wild-type control mice (40).
In this study, we have found that a 10-min acid exposure
increases fluorescence in BAR-T cells that were treated with
5-(and -6)-carboxy-2′,7′-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate, indicating that acid induces ROS production. Using another benign Barrett's epithelial cell line (QhTERT), Clemons and
colleagues also found that a 10-min acid exposure increased
the generation of intracellular ROS (17). That study did not determine whether the ROS caused the DSBs in the nonneoplastic
cell line, however. Our finding that treatment with a ROS scavenger (NAC) prevents the development of DSBs after acid exposure indicates that acid-induced DNA damage is mediated by
ROS production. Taken together, our results suggest that exposure of Barrett's epithelial cells to acid results in intracellular
acidification that induces the production of ROS, which cause
DSBs.
DSBs are especially dangerous mutations because, if they persist, they can cause genomic instability and contribute to carci-

nogenesis (14, 15). In earlier studies, we showed that acid
activates the Chk2 and p53 DNA damage response pathways
and delays cell cycle progression in nonneoplastic Barrett's epithelial cells (20, 21). DSBs are the primary stimuli that activate
the Chk2 DNA damage response pathway, and p53 is one of its
major downstream effectors (41, 42). In our nonneoplastic Barrett's
cells, we found an increase in H2AX phosphorylation (a sensitive
marker of DSBs) immediately after acid exposure, suggesting that
DNA damage is the likely trigger for the early, acid-induced activation of the Chk2 pathway that we observed in our previous studies (20). After a 10-min acid exposure, moreover, the increase in
H2AX phosphorylation persisted up to 48 h, which is more than
enough time to activate the p53 DNA damage response pathway
that we also observed in our earlier studies. In nonneoplastic
Barrett's epithelial cells, therefore, we have shown that acid is a
genotoxin that causes DSBs that persist for at least 48 h. These
observations suggest that acid can be considered a carcinogen
in Barrett's esophagus.
Our study has potential clinical implications. Our finding that
acid causes DSBs in nonneoplastic Barrett's epithelial cells and
therefore can be considered a carcinogen in Barrett's esophagus
supports the practice of aggressive acid suppression for patients
with this condition. In an earlier study using BAR-T cells, we
showed that acid exposure had potentially beneficial antiproliferative effects that were mediated by activation of the p53
and Chk2 pathways. In that study, however, it was not clear
whether those pathways were activated directly by acid (which
would be beneficial) or indirectly through DNA damage (which
would be detrimental). Our present study showing that acid
causes severe DNA damage suggests that the apparent antiproliferative effects of acid are merely a response to genetic injury.
The molecular mechanisms elucidated by our study support
the prescription of aggressive acid suppression as a chemotherapeutic strategy for patients with Barrett's esophagus. This issue
requires further investigation in prospective, controlled clinical
trials.
In conclusion, we have shown that benign Barrett's epithelial
cells exposed to acid in vitro produce ROS and develop severe
DNA damage, including DSBs, which persist for at least 48 h. We
have also documented the development of DSBs in Barrett's metaplasia following esophageal acid perfusion in vivo in patients with
Barrett's esophagus. Our finding that acid-induced DSBs can be
prevented by treating Barrett's epithelial cells with NAC or DIDS
suggests that the DNA damage is caused by ROS produced as a
consequence of intracellular acidification. Taken together, these
observations suggest that acid should be considered a carcinogen
in Barrett's esophagus.
