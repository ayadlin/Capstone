Abstract
Receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors have recently become important therapeutics for a variety of cancers.
However, due to the heterogeneous and dynamic nature of tumors, the effectiveness of these agents is often
hindered by poor response rates and acquired drug resistance. To overcome these limitations, we created a
novel small molecule, CUDC-101, which simultaneously inhibits histone deacetylase and the receptor kinases
epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) in cancer
cells. Because of its integrated histone deacetylase inhibition, CUDC-101 synergistically blocked key regulators
of EGFR/HER2 signaling pathways, also attenuating multiple compensatory pathways, such as AKT, HER3, and
MET, which enable cancer cells to escape the effects of conventional EGFR/HER2 inhibitors. CUDC-101 displayed potent antiproliferative and proapoptotic activities against cultured and implanted tumor cells that are
sensitive or resistant to several approved single-targeted drugs. Our results show that CUDC-101 has the potential to dramatically improve the treatment of heterogeneous and drug-resistant tumors that cannot be
controlled with single-target agents. Further, they provide a framework to create individual small molecules
that simultaneously antagonize multiple biochemically distinct oncogenic targets, suggesting a general paradigm to surpass conventional, single-target cancer therapeutics. Cancer Res; 70(9); 3647–56. ©2010 AACR.

Introduction
Single-target agents are often limited in their clinical
utility because tumors harbor multiple misregulated
growth and survival pathways, which can evolve during
the course of treatment. In that light, combinatory approaches to targeted therapy offer great promise, endowed
with a greater likelihood of blocking tumor survival and
metastasis through the rectification of multiple oncogenic
pathways. In some instances, multitargeting can be
achieved by simply combining several drugs against just
one specific target. The risk with such combination therapies is that multiple drugs can introduce adverse effects
related to pharmacokinetics, toxicity, and patient compliance. Alternatively, single drugs with multiple inhibitory
activities offer the advantages of pharmacokinetic simpli-

city and reduced cost. Current drugs of this type derive
their various inhibitory activities by targeting related members of the same gene family due to the cross-reactivity of
a single small molecule. To further explore the versatility
of this idea, we proposed a novel strategy with a single
small molecule designed to concurrently act on two or
more biochemically distinct targets.
In this first proof-of-principle study, we chose to integrate into one compound the crucial structural elements
required to inhibit histone deacetylase (HDAC) and human
epidermal growth factor receptor (HER) kinases. Many selective inhibitors of HER family receptor tyrosine kinases
(RTK), including erlotinib, gefitinib, and lapatinib, have become important therapeutics against multiple solid tumor
cancers (1, 2). However, due to molecular heterogeneity
among and within tumors, their efficacy is restricted to
only a small subset of patients (2). The efficacy of RTK
inhibitors is also limited by the drug resistance that frequently emerges following treatment (3, 4). Several strategies have been proposed to overcome the low response
rate and acquired resistance to RTK inhibitors. One particularly promising approach is the modulation of RTK
pathways by the inhibition of HDACs. By modulating the acetylation of both histone and nonhistone substrates (5–8),
HDAC inhibitors can affect a variety cell functions through
subsequent regulation of indirect downstream targets.
Importantly, many of these targets are key regulators of

RTK signaling pathways (6, 7, 9). Several reports also suggest a synergy between RTK and HDAC inhibition in cancer cells (10–13).
Here, we report CUDC-101, a small molecule rationally
designed to directly inhibit epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and HER2 as well as class I and class II
HDACs. We show that CUDC-101 effectively suppresses
the progression of a broad range of tumor types in both
in vitro and in vivo xenograft models, including lapatiniband erlotinib-resistant cancer cell lines. Mechanistic studies reveal that CUDC-101 not only directly inhibits both
EGFR and HER2 signaling but also indirectly attenuates
the survival signaling pathways Akt, HER3, and MET. This
work also shows a practical approach to create multitarget
anticancer agents, based on a single small molecule, which
could significantly enhance cancer therapy.

Materials and Methods
Regents. CUDC-101, vorinostat (SAHA), erlotinib, and lapatinib were synthesized as described (14). The PCR primer
pairs used for detection of Her2 (Genbank accession number:
NM_004448) and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase
(Genbank accession number: M33197) were obtained from
R&D Systems.
HDAC activity and EGFR and HER2 kinase assay. The
activities of class I and II HDACs were assessed using the
Biomol Color de Lys system. EGFR and HER2 kinase activity
was measured using the HTScan EGF receptor and HER2
kinase assay kits (Cell Signaling Technology).
Cell growth, viability, and apoptosis assay. Cancer
cell lines were obtained from the American Type Culture
Collection and were maintained according to the supplier's

of histone H3 in a dose-dependent manner. C, H292 cells were cultured and starved for 8 h before a 1-h treatment with DMSO or varying concentrations

cells per well in 96-well flat-bottomed plates with varying concentrations of compounds. The cells were incubated with
compounds for 72 hours in the presence of 0.5% of fetal bovine
serum. Growth inhibition was assessed by an ATP content assay using the Perkin-Elmer ATPlite kit. Apoptosis was routinely
assessed by measuring the activities of caspase-3 and caspase-7
using the Promega Apo-ONE Homogeneous Assay kit.
Immunoblotting, immunocytochemistry, and immunohistochemistry. Immunoblotting, immunocytochemistry,
and immunohistochemistry were done using standard procedures with a blocking solution (Li-Cor Bioscience) containing
the indicated primary and IRDye 680–, 800CW-, or peroxidaseconjugated secondary antibodies.
Efficacy study in human cancer xenograft model. Fourto 6-week-old female athymic mice (nude nu/nu CD-1,
Charles River) were inoculated s.c. into the right hind flank
region with 1 to 5 × 106 cells in a medium suspension of 100
to 200 μL. For orthotopic implantation of breast cancer cells,
a cell suspension in 100 μL of medium was injected directly
into the mammary fat pads through a 27G needle. Different
doses of CUDC-101, standard anticancer agents, and vehicle
were administered orally, i.p., or through tail vein injection
as indicated.

Results
CUDC-101 inhibits EGFR, HER2, and HDAC. We designed
and synthesized a multitarget inhibitor, CUDC-101, which integrates HDAC, EGFR, and HER2 inhibitory functional
groups into one single small molecule (molecular weight,
434; Fig. 1A). We introduced hydroxamic acid with a flexible
side chain onto the methoxyethoxy group of the phenylaminoquinazoline backbone of the RTK inhibitors (Fig. 1A). We
anticipated that these engineered molecules would fit well
into the substrate-binding pocket of HDACs and would also
interact with zinc at the active site to disrupt enzyme activity, yet still retain their ability to compete with ATP binding
and function as RTK inhibitors (14, 15). Confirming the effectiveness of this approach, we showed that one of the best
compounds, CUDC-101, inhibits EGFR and HER2 kinase
as well as HDAC enzyme activities with high potency
(2.4, 16.4, and 4.2 nmol/L, respectively; Table 1). It inhibits
both class I– and class II–purified HDACs (see Supplementary Table S1). Interestingly, we note that CUDC-101 inhibits
the erlotinib-resistant EGFR mutant T790M (2, 3), although
its effects are incomplete with an Amax of ∼60% of peak
enzyme activity after inhibition (Supplementary Fig. S1).
We next determined the effects of CUDC-101 on histone
acetylation in cancer cell lines. Exposing cells to varying
concentrations of CUDC-101 for 5 to 24 hours increased
the acetylation of histone H3 and H4 in a dose-dependant
manner in various cancer cell lines (Supplementary Fig. S2;
Fig. 1B). Similarly, we observed that CUDC-101 increased
the acetylation of p53 and α-tubulin, nonhistone substrates
of HDAC, in treated cancer cells (Supplementary Fig. S3;
Fig. 2B). We also noted that CUDC-101 inhibits EGFR autophosphorylation in a dose-dependent fashion (Supplementary

Fig. S4; Fig. 1C) and inhibits HER2 phosphorylation in cultured cancer cells (Fig. 1D). Taken together, these results
show that CUDC-101 displays activities against multiple targets, inhibiting both RTK and HDAC pathways in a variety of
cancer cell types.
To assess the selectivity of its effects, CUDC-101 was tested against a panel of 69 other kinases. It exhibited only weak
inhibition of KDR (VEGFR2), Lyn, Lck, Abl-1, FGFR-2, Flt-3,
and Ret with an IC50 of 0.85, 0.84, 5.9, 2.89, 3.43, 1.5, and
3.2 μmol/L, respectively (Supplementary Table S2). These results confirm that CUDC-101 is a selective EGFR and HER2
kinase inhibitor.
HDAC and RTK inhibition are synergistic. We next asked
whether there is any additive or synergistic effect between the
HDAC and RTK inhibition mediated by CUDC-101. In this
study, two reference compounds, vorinostat (SAHA, a HDAC
inhibitor) and erlotinib (an EGFR kinase inhibitor), were used
to achieve HDAC and EGFR pathway inhibition, respectively.
A well-established mathematical model for studying multidrug interactions was applied to the analysis (16). Our results
show that the combined inhibition of HDAC and EGFR
pathways achieves considerable synergy, as the calculated
combination index (16) is significantly smaller than 1 in an
experiment using the MDA-MB-468 breast cancer cell line
as a model (Fig. 3A). This result suggests that CUDC-101, with
its combined RTK and HDAC inhibitory activities, could act
synergistically in treated cancer cells. In this study, we also
observed a similar combination index in experiments using
varying ratios of vorinostat and erlotinib. These results suggest that a specific dosing ratio is not required to achieve a
synergistic effect on these two pathways and further validate
the idea of using one compound directed against multiple targets for improved therapeutic outcomes.
Growth-inhibition of CUDC-101 in vitro. To further confirm its apparent synergistic effects, we tested the growthinhibitory activity of CUDC-101 in a total of 54 human cancer
cell lines (see Table 2). Our results show that the compound is
effective against a broad range of cancer cell types, including
lung, pancreas, liver, colon, breast, prostate, and head and

Figure 2. CUDC-101 induces apoptosis and suppresses Akt, HER3, and MET signaling. A, HCT-116 cells were treated with varying concentrations of
CUDC-101, vorinostat, erlotinib, or a combination of vorinostat and erlotinib. After 24 h, cells were harvested and the activities of caspase-3 and
caspase-7 (normalized relative to DMSO-treated cells) were measured. Results indicate that CUDC-101 induces caspase-3 and caspase-7 activities
in a dose-dependent manner. B, MDA-MB-231 cells were treated with DMSO or varying concentrations of CUDC-101, vorinostat, erlotinib, lapatinib,
or a combination of vorinostat and erlotinib (E+V) or vorinostat and lapatinib (L+V) as indicated for 24 h. Results of Western analyses show that CUDC-101
effectively reduces the level of antiapoptotic proteins, survivin, and Bcl-xL as well as induces the level of p21. C, BT-474 cells were treated with DMSO or
1 μmol/L of CUDC-101, erlotinib, or vorinostat as indicated for 2, 7, or 24 h. Results of Western analyses indicate that CUDC-101 inhibits EGFR and HER2
phosphorylation as expected. Moreover, in contrast to erlotinib, CUDC-101 does not induce Akt reactivation in treated cells. CUDC-101 also sustainably
suppresses phosphorylated HER3 levels. Ctrl, control. D, H1993 cells, which harbor an amplification of MET, were treated with DMSO or 1 μmol/L of
CUDC-101, erlotinib, or 3 μmol/L vorinostat as indicated for 2, 7, or 24 h before Western analyses were performed. Reduced levels of phosphorylated
Akt or MET are not observed in erlotinib-treated cells. However, after 24 h of CUDC-101 or vorinostat treatment, reductions in the levels of both
phosphorylated Akt and MET are noted. All these time course studies were designed to monitor molecular events before massive protein degradation
occurred due to apoptosis. All results shown in this figure were representative of two to three experiments.

neck. Of note, CUDC-101 exhibited equal or greater potency in
these assays than vorinostat, erlotinib, lapatinib, or combinations (1:1 ratio) of vorinostat and erlotinib, or vorinostat
and lapatinib. CUDC-101 also suppressed the growth of the
lapatinib-insensitive, triple-negative (estrogen receptor negative, progesterone receptor negative, and HER2 negative)
breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231 as effectively as it did

and SkBr-3. Similarly, CUDC-101 inhibits the growth of lung
cancer cell lines that are not sensitive to erlotinib treatment,
including H1975, which harbor an EGFR-T790M mutation.
These results suggest that CUDC-101, with its synergistic inhibitions of multiple pathways, has the potential to improve the
response rates to traditional kinase inhibitors.
To further dissect the growth-inhibitory effects of
CUDC-101, we monitored caspase activity in treated cells.

A Multitargeted Inhibitor of HDAC, EGFR, and HER2

We found that CUDC-101 effectively induced the activities of
caspases 3 and 7 in HCT-116 colon cancer cells, which harbor
mutations downstream of RTK in k-Ras and phosphoinositide
3-kinase (PI3K), in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2A). In
addition, CUDC-101 reduced the levels of the antiapoptotic
protein survivin and Bcl-xL in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer
cells that did not respond well to lapatinib (Fig. 2B). We also
observed that CUDC-101 induced the expression of p21, a
cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor and key regulator of cell
proliferation (Fig. 2B), providing further evidence of the antiproliferative and proapoptotic roles of the compound in nonresponder cell lines.
CUDC-101 modulates RTK activity and expression. To
reveal the potential mechanisms behind this synergy, we examined the effects of CUDC-101 on RTK activity, transcription, and protein levels. Using breast cancer cell lines as a
model, we showed CUDC-101 simultaneously inhibited kinase
activity and suppressed RNA transcription and protein levels
(Figs. 1D and 3B and C). Both lapatinib (an EGFR/HER2 kinase
inhibitor) and erlotinib inhibited HER2 kinase activity yet
neither showed effects on Her2 transcription (Fig. 3B). In
contrast, vorinostat had no effect on kinase activity but
inhibited Her2 transcription (Fig. 3B). Both CUDC-101 and

vorinostat also reduced HER2 receptor protein levels in BT474 and SK-Br-3 cells (Fig. 3C). Taken together, these results
suggest that CUDC-101 could achieve its synergistic effects
through the modulation of multiple variables affecting RTK
signaling, including activity and protein level of RTKs.
CUDC-101 exhibits immediate and stable inhibition of
RTK and downstream Akt signaling. Many tumors invariably develop drug resistance against RTK inhibitors. One of
the proposed underlying mechanisms is a compensatory shift
in the HER3 phosphorylation-dephosphorylation equilibrium
that leads to reactivation of the downstream PI3K/Akt survival
pathway (17–19). Consistent with this hypothesis, we observed
Akt reactivation in cultured cancer cells within 8 hours of
erlotinib treatment (Fig. 2C). Similarly, we detected increased
levels of phosphorylated HER3 despite an initial downregulation following exposure to erlotinib. In contrast, CUDC-101
showed a rapid and prolonged inhibition of Akt signaling
in cultured cancer cells, with no subsequent reactivation during 24 hours of continuous exposure. The levels of phosphorylated HER3 also remained low throughout the CUDC-101
treatment period (Fig. 2C). Vorinostat also showed similar
late-stage inhibition of HER3 and Akt signaling (Fig. 2C), but
the latter effect was observed only after 8 hours of treatment

Figure 3. Synergy between RTK and HDAC pathway inhibition. A, to investigate a potential synergistic interaction between EGFR kinase and HDAC inhibitors,
we applied the median effect analysis described by Chou and Talalay (16). In this experiment, MDA-MB-468 breast cancer cells were exposed to varying
ratios of vorinostat and erlotinib (vorinostat/erlotinib, 1:1, 3:1, or 1:3). The results were plotted with the median-effect analysis, log (Fa/Fu) with respect to log (D).
Fa and Fu are fractions of cell populations that were affected (inhibited) or unaffected by drugs; D, the doses of drugs. All data fit well with linear regression
analysis (all r2 were larger than 0.92), indicating the results are highly reliable. All combination indices were calculated to be well below 1, indicating a
strong synergy from cotreatment. B, SK-Br-3 cells were treated for 24 h with varying concentrations of CUDC-101, vorinostat, or lapatinib as indicated.
Results of reverse transcription-PCR analysis indicate that with increasing concentration, CUDC-101 and vorinostat repress Her2 transcription,
whereas lapatinib has no effect. C, BT-474 or SK-Br-3 cells were treated for 24 h with DMSO (control), or 5 μmol/L vorinostat or 1 μmol/L CUDC-101
as indicated. Western analyses indicate that CUDC-101 and vorinostat reduce HER2 protein levels. All results shown in this figure were representative
of two to three experiments.

(Supplementary Fig. S5). These data suggest that CUDC-101,
with its combined inhibitory effects on RTK and HDAC, can
rapidly and sustainably suppress RTK and Akt signaling.
Furthermore, these results suggest that the multiple targeted
activities of CUDC-101 may hinder the ability of heterogeneous tumors to acquire resistance to RTK inhibitor therapy.
CUDC-101 reduces levels of phosphorylated and total
MET. MET amplification has been detected in a significant
percentage (22%) of lung tumor samples that exhibit resistance to RTK inhibitors (20–22). Therefore, we measured
the erlotinib and CUDC-101 sensitivity of a non–small cell
lung carcinoma (NSCLC) cell line (H1993) that harbors an
amplification of MET. As expected, the cells failed to respond
to erlotinib treatment, showing an IC50 of ∼20 μmol/L in a
proliferation assay (Table 2). However, the H1993 cells were
sensitive to CUDC-101, with an IC50 of ∼300 nmol/L. Moreover, CUDC-101, but not erlotinib, consistently inhibited Akt
signaling in these cells. We subsequently confirmed that
CUDC-101 can downregulate the levels of phosphorylated
and total MET, presumably due to its HDAC-inhibitory activity
(Fig. 2D). This result provides further support for CUDC-101 as
a novel agent to mitigate RTK inhibitor drug resistance.
CUDC-101 reduces estrogen receptor α protein levels.
Acquired resistance to HER2 RTK inhibitors also limits the
clinical efficacy of this important class of cancer therapeutics.
Recent evidence indicates that increased estrogen receptor
signaling may underlie lapatinib resistance in HER2-positive
breast cancers (23). Based on these data, we decided to investigate the effects of CUDC-101 on estrogen receptor α expression. Our studies revealed that CUDC-101, but not lapatinib,
can effectively suppress estrogen receptor α protein levels
with its HDAC inhibitory activity (Supplementary Fig. S6), a
finding that underscores the potential of CUDC-101 to overcome drug resistance in HER2-positive breast cancers.
CUDC-101 displays broad activity in in vivo xenograft
models. Next, we evaluated whether CUDC-101 is efficacious
in human cancer cell xenograft models. Because preclinical
studies of EGFR inhibitors in hepatocellular carcinoma cell
lines and phase II studies in human hepatocellular carcinoma
have been encouraging, we decided to compare the effects of
CUDC-101 to those of erlotinib and vorinostat in the Hep-G2
liver cancer model (Fig. 4A). At a daily dose of 120 mg/kg,

www.aacrjournals.org

CUDC-101 induced 30% tumor regression (P < 0.0001) and
was more efficacious than erlotinib at its maximum tolerated
dose and vorinostat at an equimolar concentration. Notably,
one of the seven treated mice displayed complete tumor regression at the end of the dosing cycle, an effect that lasted
for at least 6 months after treatment (Fig. 4A, bottom).
CUDC-101 also exhibited potent inhibition of tumor growth
in the erlotinib-resistant, A549 NSCLC xenograft model
(P < 0.001 compared with control; Fig. 4B). In the lapatinibresistant, HER2-negative, EGFR-overexpressing MDAMB-468 breast cancer model, CUDC-101 caused significant
tumor regression compared with control or lapatinib-treated
animals (P < 0.0001; Fig. 4B). Similar effects were observed in
the EGFR-overexpressing, CAL-27 head and neck squamous
cell carcinoma xenograft model (Fig. 4B). In all of the above
xenograft experiments, no significant weight loss or other
side effect was observed in the CUDC-101–treated animals
(Supplementary Fig. S7). Moreover, we also observed that
the combination of CUDC-101 with the chemotherapeutic
agent paclitaxel could achieve further enhanced effects and
induce tumor regression in the MDA-MB-468 breast cancer
xenograft model (Fig. 4B). Overall, our in vivo experiments
provide direct support for the rationale for improving RTK
inhibitor efficacy through the synergy of multitargeted inhibition. To determine if the observed activity in xenograft
models is target specific, we asked whether CUDC-101 can
directly inhibit EGFR and HER2 in vivo. In this experiment,
we observed an increase in acetylated histone H3 levels
(Fig. 4C) and a decrease in phosphorylated EGFR and HER2
levels (Fig. 4C and D) in tumor tissue isolated from CUDC101–treated animals. These tumors also exhibited reduced
staining of Ki67 and increased staining of activated caspase3 (Fig. 4D). Our results provide evidence that CUDC-101 inhibits specific molecular targets in vivo to block proliferation
and induce apoptosis in drug-resistant cancer cells.

Discussion
CUDC-101, a potent HDAC, EGFR, and HER2 inhibitor, is
rationally designed to synergistically suppress multiple oncogenic signaling pathways. The compound displays potent
antiproliferative and proapoptotic activities in in vitro as

Figure 4. CUDC-101 is effective against a broad range of tumor types in xenograft models. A, cultured HepG2 hepatoma cells were s.c. implanted into
nude mice. After tumors reached an average of 281 ± 60 mm3 in size, mice were sorted into four different treatment groups, seven animals per group.
Each group was treated with CUDC-101 (120 mg/kg), erlotinib (25 mg/kg), vorinostat (72 mg/kg), or vehicle (30% Captisol solution) daily as indicated.
Representative animals receiving either vehicle or CUDC-101 show a significant reduction in tumor size with the latter treatment. B, similar xenograft
experiments were conducted with CUDC-101 and a variety of reference compounds. Cell lines, initial tumor sizes, and compound doses are summarized as
follows: top left, A549, NSCLC cells, 94 mm3, CUDC-101, 120 mg/kg, i.v./i.p., daily; top right, MDA-MB-468 breast cancer cells, 112 ± 23 mm3, CUDC-101,
120 mg/kg, i.v./i.p., daily; lapatinib, 75 mg/kg, p.o., twice daily; bottom left, Cal-27, head and neck carcinoma cells, 108 ± 31 mm3, CUDC-101, 120 mg/kg,
i.v./i.p., daily; bottom right, MDA-MB-468, 92 ± 17 mm3, CUDC-101, 120 mg/kg, i.v., daily, paclitaxel, 12.5 mg/kg, i.v., twice weekly. For the combination
treatment (C+P), both CUDC-101 (120 mg/kg) and paclitaxel (12.5 mg/kg) were injected into the same animals. Statistical results are indicated as
P values. n, group sample sizes of each experiments. C and D, tumor samples were isolated from HCC827– or H292 NSCLC cell–implanted nude
mice 4 or 8 h after the last treatment, respectively. Animals were treated with CUDC-101 (15–60 mg/kg) or vehicle (30% Captisol solution) daily for 3 d
in HCC-827 cells, or CUDC-101 (60 mg/kg) or vehicle (liposome formulation) for 1 d in H292 cells. Western analysis reveals the levels of acetylated
histone H3 and phosphorylated EGFR in animals treated with varying concentrations of CUDC-101. Results show that CUDC-101 increases acetylated
histone H3 protein as well as reduces EGFR phosphorylation levels in treated animals (C). Phosphorylation levels of EGFR (a and b) and HER2 (c and d)
were measured by immunohistochemical analysis. Results show that CUDC-101 inhibits the phosphorylation of both EGFR and HER2. A decrease
in the cell proliferation marker Ki-67 (e and f) and an increase in the apoptosis marker activated caspase-3 (g and h) were also observed (D).

well as in vivo drug-resistant tumor models. Our mechanistic
studies consistently showed that it can rapidly and stably
inactivate EGFR, HER2, and other survival signaling pathways, such as Akt, HER3, and MET. Moreover, CUDC-101
has the potential to achieve further synergy in tumor suppression when combined with chemotherapeutics. Collectively, our results indicate that CUDC-101, with its unique
and novel multitarget activities, is an attractive candidate
for future clinical development. Because of its potential to
improve conventional EGFR and HER2 kinase inhibitor therapy in various cancer indications, CUDC-101 has now entered phase I clinical trials.

HER2 kinases and HDAC. To further support this, in vitro
pharmacology profiling studies revealed that CUDC-101
shows no significant activity or binding affinity to key enzymes, receptors, or transporters (Supplementary Table S3).
CUDC-101 consistently displays a favorable safety profile both
in efficacy and toxicity studies in animals (Supplementary
Table S4 and Fig. S7). The specificity and tolerability of
CUDC-101 were further supported by the preliminary data
from its ongoing phase I clinical trial. Currently, dose levels
up to 275 mg/m2 have been well tolerated with the most
frequent adverse events being dry skin/rash, nausea, fatigue,
constipation, dyspnea, and pyrexia. The type and frequency
of adverse events seem comparable with those observed
with single agent erlotinib or vorinostat therapy. No new

A Multitargeted Inhibitor of HDAC, EGFR, and HER2

CUDC-101–specific toxicities have been reported. Plasma exposure over the dose levels tested seems dose proportionate.
Taken together, these results suggest that the observed effects
of CUDC-101 are mediated specifically through the inhibition
of HDAC, EGFR, and HER2.
Synergy between RTK and HDAC pathway inhibition.
The simultaneous inhibition of RTK and HDAC pathways
through CUDC-101 can achieve synergistic effects on tumor
suppression. Indeed, a synergy between RTK and HDAC inhibition has been previously showed by others and also confirmed in this report at several levels. First, cotreatment with
HDAC and RTK inhibitors in cultured cancer cells has a calculated combination index lower than 1 (10–13). Second,
CUDC-101 reduces RTK transcription and/or protein levels
as well as those of downstream regulators, suggesting that
direct kinase inhibition is enhanced by indirect effects on expression. Finally, CUDC-101 as well as other HDAC inhibitors
reduce HIF-1α protein levels (Supplementary Fig. S8), suggesting that antitumor activity could be accomplished by a combination of antiproliferative and antiangiogenic effects (9).
A viable approach to improve response rate. CUDC-101
displays high potency in both in vitro and in vivo models. The
finding that both erlotinib-sensitive and erlotinib-resistant
NSCLC cell lines are highly responsive to CUDC-101 treatment
suggests that future clinical applications may improve patient
response. Similarly, CUDC-101 is effective in both lapatinibsensitive (HER2 positive) and lapatinib-resistant (HER2 negative) breast cancer models. These results provide further
support for the therapeutic rationale to simultaneously inhibit
HDAC and EGFR/HER2 to boost antiproliferative effects in
cancer cells. CUDC-101 also achieves greater potency than
combinations of HDAC and EGFR or HER2 inhibitors. The
most parsimonious explanation is that HDAC and EGFR activities are each more effectively inhibited by CUDC-101 than
by vorinostat and erlotinib, respectively.
Inroads to overcoming drug resistance. Acquired resistance to tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy likely results from
further mutations of the RTK gene and/or the compensatory
effects of survival pathways through additional or reactivated
downstream signaling. CUDC-101 could overcome such drug
resistance through its ability to both inhibit RTK activity and

reduce protein levels as well as suppress survival signaling
pathways. Patients with NSCLC typically relapse within a year
of treatment. In many cases, relapse correlates with a secondary mutation, T790M, in the EGFR kinase domain. Interestingly, we found that CUDC-101 can inhibit the EGFR-T790M
mutant to an Amax of ∼60% of peak enzyme activity (Supplementary Fig. S1). In addition, CUDC-101 downregulates EGFR
protein levels in H1975 cells, which harbor an EGFR-T790M
mutation (Supplementary Fig. S9). Consistent with this finding, we observed that H1975 is sensitive to CUDC-101, but
not erlotinib treatment (Table 2). By virtue of its effects on
both the enzymatic activity and protein levels of the mutated
EGFR, our results support that CUDC-101 may overcome drug
resistance in NSCLC tumors resulting from secondary EGFR
kinase domain mutations. CUDC-101 could also overcome
drug resistance by inhibiting other survival signaling pathways. For instance, in breast cancer and NSCLC cells, CUDC101 suppressed Akt, HER3, and MET signaling. CUDC-101 also
reduced the levels of estrogen receptor protein in breast cancer cells. These results further support the potential of CUDC101 to escape drug resistance in its future clinical application.
In summary, our results indicate that CUDC-101, with its
unique and novel multitarget activities, is suited for future clinical development as a potential means to improve marketed
EGFR/HER2 kinase inhibitors in various cancer indications. Importantly, this report provides a proof-of-principle that one can
create a single small molecule with multiple targeted specificities
to improve the effectiveness of current anticancer therapeutics.
