Abstract
Brain metastasis is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with
breast cancer. Our previous studies indicated that Stat3 plays an important role in
brain metastasis. Here, we present evidence that Stat3 functions at the level of the
microenvironment of brain metastases. Stat3 controlled constitutive and inducible
VEGFR2 expression in tumor-associated brain endothelial cells. Furthermore, inhibition
of Stat3 by WP1066 decreased the incidence of brain metastases and increased
survival in a preclinical model of breast cancer brain metastasis. WP1066 inhibited
Stat3 activation in tumor-associated endothelial cells, reducing their infiltration and
angiogenesis. WP1066 also inhibited breast cancer cell invasion. Our results indicate
that WP1066 can inhibit tumor angiogenesis and brain metastasis mediated by Stat3
in endothelial and tumor cells.

INTRODUCTION

The formation of brain metastases is determined
by both tumor cell properties and host factors. Tumor
cells may release vascular endothelial growth factor
(VEGF; also known as vascular permeability factor),
inducing neovascularization in brain metastases [6].
Indeed, the progressive growth of brain metastases is
dependent on expression of VEGF. VEGF activates
signaling in endothelial cells after binding receptors on
the cell surface, including VEGF receptor 2 (VEGFR2)
(KDR/Flk-1). VEGFR2 signaling activates a variety of
downstream signaling pathways in endothelial cells,
including the Stat3, PI3K, and MEK-ERK pathways [79], and is responsible for many of the characteristic effects

The major cause of death from breast cancer is
metastases that are resistant to conventional therapies [1].
Brain metastasis occurs in about 20% of patients with
breast cancer and is a major cause of death in patients
with breast cancer [2]. The prognosis of patients with brain
metastasis is poor [3-5], with a median survival of 4 to
6 months, because brain metastases are largely refractory
to current treatments, including surgery, radiation
therapy, and chemotherapy. Thus, targeted treatment and
prevention strategies for brain metastasis are needed to
improve the survival rate of breast cancer patients.

of VEGF on endothelial cells, including cell proliferation,
survival, migration, and increased vascular permeability
[10-12]. Moreover, VEGF induces expression of its
receptors, including VEGFR2 [13, 14], but its molecular
mechanisms are not fully understood. In the present study,
we found Stat3 is a direct transcription factor for VEGFR2
and increases its expression.
Stat3 is a member of the JAK-STAT (Janus
kinase-signal transducer and activator of transcription)
signaling pathway [15, 16]. In breast cancer cells, both
genetic and epigenetic alterations have been shown to
activate Stat3, including alterations in Her2/Neu, EGFR,
BRCA1, and estrogen receptor [17, 18]. Overexpression
of constitutively activated Stat3 in immortalized breast
cells induced tumor formation [19]. Stat3 has also been
linked with cellular proliferation, promotion of apoptosis,
invasion, angiogenesis, and evasion of host immune
responses [20-25]. Furthermore, Stat3 activation has been
implicated as an important driver of brain metastasis in
breast cancer, although the mechanisms are not fully
understood [26, 27].
In the current study, we sought to determine the
role of Stat3 in the interaction between endothelial cells
and tumor cells in breast cancer brain metastasis. We
tested the effect of a Stat3 inhibitor, WP1066 [29-31],
on breast cancer brain metastasis in a preclinical mouse
model. WP1066 has been shown to effectively block
JAK2 and Stat3 activation in multiple tumor cell types,
including glioma cell lines [29, 30]. We also explored
the mechanisms underlying the inhibitory effects of
WP1066 on metastasis of breast cancer to the brain. We
demonstrate that WP1066 reduced the incidence of brain
metastasis and significantly extended the overall survival
of metastasis-bearing mice. We also show a unique role
of Stat3 activation via VEGFR2 in orchestrating the
interaction between endothelial and brain tumor cells and
promoting breast cancer brain metastasis.

IDC specimens exhibited strong positive, 25.6% moderate
positive, and 68.9% weak to negative staining for pStat3
(Fig. 1B and Supplementary Fig. S1). In contrast, 30.3%
of the brain metastasis specimens exhibited strong
positive, 46.1% moderate positive, and 23.6% weak to
negative staining for pStat3. When the data regarding
strong positive and moderate positive staining were
analyzed using χ2 test, significantly higher levels of pStat3
were evident in breast cancer brain metastases than in IDC
specimens (Fig. 1B; P < 0.001).

WP1066 inhibited Stat3 activation in breast
cancer brain metastatic cells
On the basis of the above findings, we hypothesized
that treatment with WP1066, a Stat3 inhibitor [29], would
inhibit brain metastasis by reducing Stat3 activation.
MDA-MB-231BR and BT-474BR cells were treated with
1 µM WP1066 for 1 to 24 hours and then examined for
levels of pStat3. WP1066 substantially decreased pStat3
level in both cell lines in a time-dependent manner (Fig.
1C; Supplementary Fig. S2).

Brain permeability of WP1066
To determine the brain permeability of WP1066,
WP1066 (40 mg/kg) was injected intraperitoneally into
nude mice every other day until three doses had been
given. After the third dose, the brains were harvested from
mice, and the plasma and brain concentrations of WP1066
were measured by LC/MS/MS. WP1066 distribution into
the brain was more favorable than WP1066 distribution
into plasma. The concentration of WP1066 in brain tissue
was 1.06 µM to 1.81 µM (mean 1.50 µM) (Fig. 1D). In
contrast, the concentration of WP1066 in plasma was 0.10
µM to 0.027 µM (mean 0.018 µM) (Fig. 1D). Moreover,
the mean brain/plasma ratio of WP1066 was 92.8 (Fig.
1D), indicating that brain concentrations of WP1066 were
more than 90 times plasma concentrations. These data
indicated a potentially high distribution of WP1066 into
brain tissue, suggesting activity of WP1066 against brain
metastases.

RESULTS
Stat3 activation correlated directly with the brain
metastatic potential of breast cancer cells

WP1066 inhibited brain metastases of breast
cancer cells in nude mice

We first examined Stat3 activity in MDA-MB-231
and BT-474 cell lines and in brain metastatic cell lines
MDA-MB-231BR and BT-474BR. Stat3 activity is
significantly higher in MDA-MB-231BR and BT-474BR
cells than in their wild-type counterparts (Fig. 1A),
indicating that Stat3 was constitutively activated at higher
levels in brain metastatic breast cancer cells.
Next, we analyzed 90 breast invasive ductal
carcinoma (IDC) and 89 breast cancer brain metastasis
specimens using immunohistochemistry for nuclear
staining of pStat3, the activated form of Stat3. 5.5% of the

We used the well-established brain metastases model
of MDA-MB-231BR cells to test the effect of WP1066
on brain metastases [28]. WP1066 treatment (40 mg/kg)
began on day 3 (early treatment) or 9 (late treatment) after
tumor cell injection and continued every other day until
six doses had been given (Supplementary Fig. 1C). Thirty
days after tumor cell injection, the brains were harvested
from mice of each group, and the numbers of metastases

were determined. Early administration of WP1066
reduced the number of large metastases by 68.18%, and
reduced the number of micrometastases by 57.59% (Fig.
1E). Late administration of WP1066 reduced the number
of large metastases by 63.63%, and reduced the number of
micrometastases by 55.36%.
We also determined the effect of WP1066 on
survival of mice bearing brain metastases over a 100-day
period. As shown in Fig. 1F and G, MDA-MB-231BR
cells produced brain metastases in all of the injected mice,
and the mice became moribund around 35 days after
cell injection. In contrast, early treatment with WP1066
significantly increased the survival of the mice injected
with MDA-MB-231BR cells (P <0.001). These results
showed that WP1066 treatment suppressed breast cancer
cell brain metastasis and increased survival duration in a
mouse model of brain metastasis.

decreased by 1 µM WP1066 in both cell lines (Fig. 2C-F).
Consistent with the in vitro results, the level of MMP9
was significantly lower in brain metastases of MDA-MB231BR cells from WP1066-treated mice than in brain
metastases from control mice (Supplemental Fig. S4).

WP1066 reduced VEGF expression and
angiogenic potential of brain metastatic cells
Since angiogenesis is another major step of
metastasis, we examined whether WP1066 would
affect angiogenesis of brain metastases by assessing
vascularization of brain metastases of MDA-MB-231BR
cells. Brain metastases in the control group were highly
vascularized whereas brain metastases in the WP1066
treatment groups had lower microvessel density (Fig. 3A
and B).
Therefore, we determined the effects of WP1066
on the angiogenic ability of brain metastatic cells by
conducting an endothelial cell tube formation assay with
mouse brain endothelial cell line bEnd.3. The conditioned
medium from WP1066-treated MDA-MB-231BR
cells significantly reduced capillary tube formation, as
compared with the conditioned medium from control
cells (Fig. 3C). Moreover, WP1066 (1 µM) significantly
reduced the expression of VEGF in MDA-MB-231BR
and BT-474BR cells (Fig. 3D). Consistently, in the brain
metastases, VEGF expression was prominent in the MDAMB-231BR control group but was significantly decreased
in WP1066 treatment groups (Supplemental Fig. S4).

Effect of WP1066 on survival and proliferation of
brain metastatic cells
To study the mechanism of inhibition of brain
metastases by WP1066, we first tested the effect of
WP1066 on viability of MDA-MB-231BR cells. WP1066
substantially reduced their survival in a dose-dependent
manner (Fig. 2A). However, WP1066 inhibited the
viability of the cells only at concentrations of 3 µM and
above; WP1066 had no effect at concentrations under 2
µM (Fig. 2A). Also, WP1066 inhibited the viability of BT474BR cells only at concentrations of 2 µM and above
(Fig. 2A).
Since the concentration of WP1066 in the brain
tissue was below 2 µM (Fig. 1E), we next wanted to rule
out the possibility that the inhibitory effect of WP1066
against brain metastasis was caused by cytotoxicityinduced apoptosis using a TUNEL assay. The number of
TUNEL-positive cells in the tumor sections was almost
same in vehicle-treated mice and WP1066-treated mice
(Supplemental Fig. S3), suggesting that WP1066 did
not induce apoptosis of tumor cells. Thus, the inhibitory
effect of WP1066 on brain metastasis was not due to
cytotoxicity.

VEGF induced VEGFR2 expression in brain
endothelial cells through Stat3 activation
The above data suggested that VEGF in the
conditioned medium of brain metastatic cells might
activate brain endothelial cells and cause them to undergo
angiogenesis. Therefore, we examined the VEGFR2
phosphorylation in bEnd.3 cells cultured with conditioned
medium of brain metastatic cells, since pVEGFR2
is a marker for endothelial cell activation [32]. The
conditioned medium of MDA-MB-231BR cells induced
up-regulation of pVEGFR2, as compared with serumfree culture medium (Fig. 4A). Knockdown of VEGFR2
impaired the angiogenic ability of bEnd.3 cells induced by
the conditioned medium (Fig. 4A and B), indicating that
VEGFR2 is indeed a marker for endothelial cell activation.
Next, we tested whether VEGF in the conditioned
medium is the factor that caused VEGFR2 activation.
Exogenous human VEGF increased the level of pVEGFR2
in bEnd.3 cells in serum-free medium (Fig. 4C). In
contrast, a VEGF neutralizing antibody decreased the
level of pVEGFR2 in bEnd.3 cells in conditioned medium
(Fig. 4C). Moreover, the levels of pStat3 changed in
parallel with the changes of pVEGFR2 (Fig. 4C), which is

WP1066 reduced MMP9 expression and invasion
of brain metastatic cells
We sought to determine the effects of WP1066 on
invasion ability of brain metastatic breast cancer cells.
WP1066 (1 µM) led to a significant decrease of invasion
ability of both MDA-MB-231BR and BT-474BR cells
(Fig. 2B). Next, because tumor invasion is through
degradation extracellular matrix and basement membrane
by matrix metalloproteinases, we assessed the changes
of MMP-9, the main matrix metalloproteinases in the
above cell lines. MMP9 protein level and activity were

WP1066 inhibited the activation hence migration
and invasion of brain endothelial cells induced by
brain metastatic breast cancer cells

consistent with previous reports of VEGF activating Stat3
via VEGFR2 phosphorylation [33].
Surprisingly, the level of VEGFR2 was increased in
bEnd.3 cells in conditioned medium of MDA-MB-231BR
cells (Fig. 4D). Moreover, the level of VEGFR2, but not
the level of VEGFR1, was lower in bEnd.3 cells treated
with WP1066 in the conditioned medium than in bEnd.3
cells treated with control vehicle in the conditioned
medium (Fig. 4D). Furthermore, the level of pStat3 was
lower in in bEnd.3 cells treated with WP1066 in the
conditioned medium than in bEnd.3 cells treated with
control vehicle in the conditioned medium (Fig. 4D), but
the total Stat3 level was not affected by WP1066 treatment
(Fig. 4D). These results suggested that VEGFR2 increase
induced by conditioned medium of MDA-MB-231BR
cells was due to the activation of Stat3.

The above results indicated that Stat3 activity
regulated VEGFR-2 in brain endothelial cells and hence
regulated their activation, thus, we examined whether
WP1066 has direct cytotoxic effects on brain endothelial
cells. WP1066 at low concentrations (1-3 µM) was not
cytotoxic to bEnd.3 cells (Fig. 6A). However, a low
concentration of WP1066 (1 µM) inhibited the activation
of brain endothelial cells induced by brain metastatic
breast cancer cells (Fig. 6B).
Since migration and invasion of brain endothelial
cells require the activation of the cells, we examined
whether conditioned medium of MDA-MB-231BR
cells could induce migration and invasion of brain
endothelial cells. Migration and invasion of bEnd.3 cells
in conditioned medium of MDA-MB-231BR cells was
increased compared to that in serum-free medium (Fig.
6C and D). In contrast, migration and invasion of bEnd.3
cells in conditioned medium from WP1066-treated MDAMB-231BR cells was decreased (Fig. 6C and D). These
results indicated that WP1066 inhibited the invasion and
migration of brain endothelial cells induced by brain
metastatic breast cancer cells.

Stat3 directly regulated the transcription of
VEGFR2
We tested whether VEGFR2 is a downstream
transcriptional target of Stat3. Knockdown of Stat3 in
bEnd.3 cells in serum-free medium decreased VEGFR2
expression whereas transfection of a constitutively
activated mutant of Stat3 (Stat3C) plasmid led to increased
VEGFR2 expression in bEnd.3 cells (Fig. 5A), indicating
that Stat3 regulates the basal levels of VEGFR2 in the
cells. Furthermore, knockdown of Stat3 expression in
bEnd.3 cells in conditioned medium decreased VEGFR2
expression (Fig. 5A).
Next, we analyzed the sequence of the murine
VEGFR-2 promoter by using the Stat3 consensus
sequences AA (N4) TT and AA (N5) TT [34]. We
identified two putative Stat3-binding sites in the VEGFR-2
promoter (Fig. 5B). Both of the Stat3-binding regions of
the VEGFR-2 promoter bound to endogenous Stat3 protein
in bEnd.3 cells by ChIP assays (Fig. 5C). Moreover, we
examined whether Stat3 activation transactivates the
VEGFR-2 promoter by using a murine VEGFR-2 (flk1)
promoter luciferase reporter [35]. Overexpressed Stat3C
upregulated VEGFR-2 promoter activity in bEnd.3 cells
cultured in serum-free medium (Fig. 5D). Furthermore,
VEGFR2 promoter activity was increased in bEnd.3 cells
in conditioned medium of MDA-MB-231BR cells (Fig.
5D), whereas VEGFR2 promoter activity was decreased
in bEnd.3 cells with Stat3 siRNA or with conditioned
medium of MDA-MB-231BR cells treated with WP1066
(Fig. 5D). Consistent with the in vitro results, VEGFR-2
expression in brain metastases was significantly reduced
by WP1066 treatment in mice (Supplemental Fig. S4).
Collectively, these results indicated that VEGFR2 is a
direct transcriptional target of Stat3 and that WP1066
downregulates VEGFR-2 expression by inhibition of
Stat3.

DISCUSSION
In the present study, we sought to determine
the role of Stat3 in the interaction between tumor cells
and endothelial cells in breast cancer brain metastases.
Our novel clinical and mechanistic evidence strongly
suggests that activated Stat3 binds directly to the
VEGFR2 promoter and increases its transcription (Fig
6E). Conversely, VEGFR2 positively regulates activation
of Stat3 and invasion of brain endothelial cells (Fig 6E).
Moreover, suppression of Stat3 activation by the small
molecular inhibitor WP1066 inhibited the activation
of brain endothelial cells and brain metastasis of breast
cancer cells in an animal model, presumably by inhibition
of the transcription of Stat3-target genes including
VEGFR2 and MMP-9 in both endothelial cells and tumor
cells (Fig 6E).
The growth and propagation of brain metastases
depend on the establishment of an adequate blood
supply—i.e., angiogenesis. The angiogenic phenotype of
brain metastases have been shown to be associated with
an increase in the production of proangiogenic molecules
by the tumor cells and brain environments [2-5]. Previous
studies have established that VEGF is involved in breast
cancer brain metastasis [36]. However, the function of
VEGF depends on the activation of receptors, including
VEGFR2.
VEGFR2 is mainly expressed in endothelial cells

(E) Stat3 regulates breast cancer cell brain metastasis by affecting interaction between tumor cells and endothelial cells and tumor cell
invasive. Activated Stat3 in tumor cells upregulates the expression of VEGF that induces the phosphorylation of VEGFR2 in endothelial
cells. The phosphorylated VEGFR2 leads to phosphorylation hence activation of Stat3 in endothelial cells. Then the activated Stat3 directly
upregulates VEGFR2 expression in endothelial cells, which leads to further activation of VEGFR2 in the cells, increasing their infiltration
and angiogenesis. Therefore, Stat3 activation orchestrates the interaction between endothelial and tumor cells. Stat3 also directly regulates
MMP-9 expression hence breast cancer cell and endothelial invasion. WP1066 can effectively inhibit tumor angiogenesis and invasion thus
brain metastasis mediated by Stat3.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

[11]. VEGFR2 activation induces cell proliferation,
migration, and tube formation of endothelial cells [37].
VEGFR2 is also expressed in brain metastasis-associated
endothelial cells [38]. Targeting VEGFR2 with an
anti-VEGFR2 antibody in combination with a HER2
inhibitor significantly slowed breast cancer growth in
the brain, resulting in a striking survival benefit [38].
Furthermore, we found that MDA-MB-231BR cells also
express VEGFR2 (data not shown). Therefore, VEGFR2
appears to be a critical target for the suppression of
brain metastasis. However, the mechanisms for the
overexpression and activation of VEGFR2 in breast cancer
brain metastasis are unclear.
The transcription factors Sp1, HoxB5, and GATA2 have been implicated in regulation of VEGFR2
expression via its promoter in other diseases [3941] whereas the transcription factor FoxC2 regulates
VEGFR2 expression through binding of VEGFR-2
enhancer [14]. The current study is the first to show that
Stat3 regulates the transcription of VEGFR2. Our data
adds a new mechanism to the body of knowledge on
the transcriptional regulation of VEGFR2 expression by
providing evidence that VEGFR2 is a direct transcriptional
target of Stat3 and that Stat3 critically controls constitutive
and inducible VEGFR2 expression in endothelial cells.
More importantly, our study indicates that Stat3 activation
orchestrates the interaction between endothelial cells
and tumor cells, which is known to be crucial for tumor
growth and metastasis [6, 42-45]. Stat3 upregulates VEGF
expression in tumor cells and that VEGF induces the
activation of VEGFR2 in endothelial cells. The activated
VEGFR2 then activates Stat3 in endothelial cells, which
leads to VEGFR2 upregulation and further activation.
This Stat3-orchestrated interaction between endothelial
and tumor cells resulted in a number of cellular activities
involved in angiogenesis, including endothelial cell
migration, invasion and tube formation. Blocking of Stat3
by WP1066 resulted in reduced VEGFR-induced signaling
and angiogenesis, which further supports the role of Stat3
in the interaction of tumor cells and endothelial cells.
Our data validate, in a preclinical model, the
efficacy of WP1066 for the inhibition of brain metastasis
by human breast cancer cells. The inhibition of brain
metastasis by WP1066 was paralleled by reduced pStat3
staining in the remaining lesions in vivo, confirming that
the drug affected its intended target. Taken together, our
findings indicate that blocking Stat3 activity with WP1066
may have promise in the treatment of brain metastasis
of breast cancer through targeting both tumor cells and
tumor-associated endothelial cells.

Cell lines and culture conditions
MDA-MB-231BR and BT-474BR “brain-seeking”
cell lines were described previously [26, 28]. Mouse brain
endothelial cell line bEnd.3 was purchased from American
Type Culture Collection. All cell lines were maintained in
Eagle’s MEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum,
sodium pyruvate, nonessential amino acids, L-glutamine,
and a twofold vitamin solution (Flow Laboratories).

Human tissue specimens
Tissue from human breast invasive ductal carcinoma
and breast cancer brain metastases were coded without any
patient identifiers. The use of the tissue was approved by
the Institutional Review Board of The University of Texas
MD Anderson Cancer Center. Archival paraffin-embedded
specimens from 90 invasive ductal carcinomas and 89
breast cancer brain metastases were used in the study.

Reagents
WP1066 was synthesized at The University of Texas
MD Anderson Cancer Center and dissolved in dimethyl
sulfoxide (DMSO) for in vitro studies. For in vivo
experiments, WP1066 was administered via intraperitoneal
injection in a vehicle of DMSO/polyethylene glycol (PEG)
300 (1:4 ratio) (Sigma). Recombinant human VEGF and
neutralizing VEGF antibody were from R&D Systems.
SMARTpool siRNA duplexes specific for Stat3 and
VEGFR2 and a nontargeting siRNA (siControl) were
purchased from Dharmacon.

Experimental brain metastasis model
Female athymic BALB/c nude mice were purchased
from the National Cancer Institute (Frederick, MD). The
mouse experiments were conducted under a protocol
approved by the Institute Animal Care and Use Committee
of MD Anderson Cancer Center. Mice were inoculated
with 5 x 105 MDA-MB-231BR cells in the heart’s left
ventricle. A 100-μL intraperitoneal injection of WP1066
(40 mg/kg in DMSO/PEG 300 vehicle) or vehicle alone
was administrated every other day. The Size of metastases
was measured by 16mm2 ocular grid. The mean numbers
of large metastases (>300 μM on the long axis) and
micrometastases (smaller than large metastases) were
determined by counting the number of metastases from
one hemisphere of the brain as described previously [4].
