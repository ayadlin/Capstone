METHODS. Twenty patients with recurrent gliomas were treated with bevacizumab
5 mg/kg and irinotecan 125 mg/m2 every 2 weeks. The response was evaluated by gadolinium-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging performed every 4 cycles of treatment.

RESULTS. The patients received 1 to 22 cycles of treatment. Nine of 19 patients
available for response evaluation (47.3%) showed an objective radiologic
response: 2 patients (10.5%) a complete response (CR), and 7 patients (36.8%) a
partial response (PR). Two additional patients showed stable disease (SD) for 2
and 6 months, respectively. Eight patients developed rapid progression after 1 to
4 cycles of treatment. Median time to progression on treatment was 4.7 months.
The 6-month progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were 25%
and 55%, respectively. The adverse effects were mild and in all but 2 cases were
no more than grade 2. There were no thrombotic complications or significant
bleeding other than epistaxis.

CONCLUSIONS. The preliminary data show a promising high response rate
of recurrent high-grade gliomas to chemotherapy with bevacizumab and irinotecan. The regimen is associated with minimal toxicity. Cancer 2008;112:2267–73.

ver the last 20 years dozens of antineoplastic agents have been
tested as single agents and in different combinations for the
treatment of high-grade gliomas. Despite this fact, treatment with
cytotoxic chemotherapy has not significantly changed the dismal
prognosis of these tumors. A meta-analysis of more than 3000
patients with high-grade gliomas treated in 12 randomized clinical
trials demonstrated only a 6% increase in 1-year survival and a
2-month increase in median survival for patients treated with chemotherapy, as compared with patients receiving radiation treatment
alone.1 Since 1980 the only Food and Drug Administration-approved
drug for the treatment of malignant gliomas had been nitrosourea,
joined only in the last decade by temozolomide and carmustinepolymer implantable wafers. Whereas concomitant use of radiation
and temozolomide has been recently defined as the standard firstline approach for therapy of newly diagnosed grade 4 gliomas,2 the
conventional treatment of recurrent high-grade glial tumors remains
ill-defined. The use of second-line chemotherapy in this patient
population is associated with unsatisfactory response rates of about
10% and median survival of less than 7 months.3

New treatment strategies that include the use of
‘smart’ biologic agents gave rise to hopes in the last
decade that this extremely poor outcome may be
changed. Unfortunately, the results of most phase
2 clinical trials of new biologic agents have not
shown significant improvement of response rates
and survival for patients with recurrent high-grade
gliomas.4–11
After the first preliminary report of an unusually
high response rate of 43% to treatment with the
combination of bevacizumab and irinotecan in a series of 21 patients with recurrent high-grade gliomas,12 this regimen has attracted considerable
interest. In a recent publication of a phase 2 trial of
this drug combination, the rate of radiographic
response was 63%, with 6-month survival of 72%.13
Such a high response rate is highly unusual for this
patient population. Unfortunately, 4 patients (12.5%)
in this series suffered from severe thrombotic complications, resulting in 2 toxic deaths. Severe nonhematologic treatment-related side effects were
reported as well in the initial publication of StarkVance,12 and included fatal intracranial hemorrhage
in 1 patient and gastrointestinal perforation in
another. We began using a similar treatment protocol
in August 2005, with a reduced dose of bevacizumab
as compared with the regimen of Vredenburgh
et al.13 In this publication we report the results of
treatment of 20 patients with recurrent high-grade
gliomas who showed similar high rates of response,
but without significant adverse effects of treatment.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Twenty adult patients with recurrent high-grade gliomas were treated with irinotecan and bevacizumab
in the Tel Aviv Sourasky Medical Center from August
2005 to April 2007. All patients signed informed consent, and we received approval by the Institutional
Review Board for off-label use of irinotecan and
bevacizumab. The patient characteristics are summarized in Table 1. There were 14 men and 6
women, with a median age of 56. Seventeen patients
suffered from recurrent or progressive glioblastoma
multiforme (GBM), and 3 other patients had grade 3
gliomas (anaplastic oligodendroglioma in 2 and anaplastic oligoastrocytoma in 1 patient). All patients
had previously undergone 1 to 3 operations for removal of their tumors; all but 1 patient had been
irradiated. All patients had received at least 1 line of
prior chemotherapy; 13 patients had been initially
treated according to the ‘Stupp regimen’.2 In 15
patients the treatment was started after failure of the
previous chemotherapy protocol; in 1 patient after

failure of radiation treatment; and in 4 patients
within 1 month after surgery for recurrent tumor. We
permitted treatment of patients with relatively low
performance status (Karnofsky performance status
[KPS] 50), providing that they had acceptable laboratory values. The median KPS for the group was
65%: 10 patients had KPS <70%, 7 patients had KPS
70% to 80%, and 3 additional patients had KPS 90%
to 100%. We did not exclude patients with a history
of thrombotic events or patients receiving chronic
anticoagulation (patients taking warfarin were transferred to low molecular weight heparin).

Treatment Regimen
On the basis of prior reports of increased metabolism
of irinotecan in the presence of enzyme-inducing
antiepileptic drugs (EIAED) via the cytochrome p450
hepatic pathway,14,15 these medications were discontinued before starting combination treatment, and
patients were put on non-EIAED. Bevacizumab and
irinotecan were administered intravenously every
second week: bevacizumab at the dose of 5 mg/kg,
and irinotecan at the dose of 125 mg/m2. Blood
count and urine protein analysis tests were performed before each treatment. Patients started the

Bevacizumab and Irinotecan in High-Grade Gliomas/Bokstein et al.

protocol with a stable dose of corticosteroids and
efforts were made not to increase the steroid dose
before the first radiologic evaluation of response to
treatment. Appropriate antiemetic drugs were permitted (including 20 mg of dexamethasone on day of
treatment). A 25% dose reduction of irinotecan was
permitted for patients with grade 3–4 gastrointestinal
or grade 4 hematologic toxicity, but no patient
required a dose reduction.
All the patients had a gadolinium-enhanced
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at baseline before
starting the treatment. Patients after recurrent surgery were permitted to start the treatment without
radiologically measurable disease. MRI studies were
performed every 4 treatments (2 months). Evaluation
of response was performed according to McDonald
et al. criteria.16 Patients without measurable enhancing disease postoperatively, who remained without
measurable disease during their treatment course,
were excluded from response evaluation.

Statistical Considerations
Because of the retrospective character of the study
and lack of a suitable control group, comparative
statistics were not performed. Survival analysis was
done using Kaplan-Maier estimates for progressionfree survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS).

RESULTS
The 20 patients received 1 to 22 cycles of treatment (median, 9.5). Treatment was continued until
tumor progression in 17 patients. In 1 GBM patient
treated postoperatively (described below), treatment
was stopped electively after 8 months. In another
patient with anaplastic oligodendroglioma treatment was stopped after 6 months of stable disease.
Two patients continue the regimen at more than
16 months.
Nineteen of the 20 patients were available for
response evaluation. Nine of 19 patients (47.4%)
showed an objective radiologic response: 2 (10.5%)
had a complete response (CR), and 7 patients
(36.8%) had a partial response (PR) (Table 2). Notably, all objective responses were evident on the first
radiologic evaluation performed after the 4 initial
treatments. In 2 additional patients the disease
remained radiologically and clinically stable (for 2
months in 1 patient and for 6 months in another).
Remarkably, among 11 patients showing objective
response or stable disease (SD) 1 patient did not
receive steroids, in 2 patients the dose of steroids
was not changed before the first MRI evaluation, and
in 9 additional patients it was decreased. The clinical

benefit of the treatment (CR 1 PR 1 SD) was 57.8%.
Eight patients (42.1%) did not respond to treatment
and showed signs of clinical progression, confirmed
radiologically in 6 cases. Noteworthy, progressing
patients received only 1 to 4 treatments, because
the progression was evident early after starting the
protocol.
We had only 1 case of a patient without measurable disease postoperatively at the time treatment
was started. In this 28-year-old GBM patient, treatment was electively stopped, without evidence of
active residual disease after 8 months (16 cycles).
This patient was excluded from response evaluation.
He developed a massive local recurrence only 2
months after the discontinuation of the treatment,
underwent debulking of the recurrent tumor, and
was again treated with the same regimen of bevacizumab and irinotecan. The patient did respond to
treatment for a second time with a PR that unfortunately lasted only 3 months; he died 5.5 months
after rechallenge with the regimen from progressive
disease.
As mentioned above, radiologic evaluation of
response was performed by a gadolinium-enhanced
MRI every 4 treatments. Among responders, in 2
patients there was a decrease in enhancement on
T1-weighted images without significant changes on
fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) sequence,
whereas 7 patients showed a decrease in both enhancement and FLAIR changes (Fig. 1). Radiologic
progression or recurrence was diagnosed based on
increasing enhancement in 4 previously responding
or stable patients, and based on increased abnormal
signal on both T1-weighted and FLAIR sequences in
6 patients (Table 3).

The 6-month PFS and OS for the whole group
were 25% and 55%, respectively (Table 2). For
responding patients (PR 1 CR) the 6-month PFS was
50%, and 6-month OS was 90%. The median PFS was
4.2 months (0.7–10.5 months) and median OS was
7.0 months (1.7–16.0 months). The Kaplan-Meier PFS
and OS curves are shown in Figure 2.
Side effects are summarized in Table 4. Notably,
there were no grade 3–4 hematologic toxicities, and
only 2 cases of transient grade 3 nonhematologic
toxicities (severe fatigue in 1 patient and psychosis in
another), which did not require treatment discontinuation or dose reduction. We did not observe any
thrombotic complications or severe bleeding other
than epistaxis. None of the patients discontinued
treatment because of side effects or poor compliance. Three responding patients remain on treatment
7 to 161 months after initiation of treatment with
the regimen.

DISCUSSION
Similar to previously published series12,13,17 we
observed an impressively high response rate of recurrent high-grade gliomas to a bevacizumab-based

treatment protocol, with 2 of 19 complete responders
and 7 of 19 partial responders. These results are particularly impressive, considering that the mean KPS
in our group was 65% at the beginning of therapy,
with 10 patients having KPS <70 (compared with

mean KPS >80%, only 2 patients with KPS <70%, in
the recent publication of Vredenburgh et al.13). To
our knowledge, no other treatment regimen for highgrade glioma has been shown to achieve such a high
rate of response.
At this point it is not clear whether antiangiogenic mechanisms are more effective in the cases of
enhancing measurable disease versus microscopic residual tumor. Theoretically, the antiangiogenic effect
should work even more efficiently against microscopic disease where there is decreased tumor burden. One patient in our series began treatment
postoperatively, without measurable disease, and
appeared to have an extended disease-free interval
(9.8 months), most likely as a positive response to
this regimen. In the ongoing Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) study 0625 for recurrent GBM,
residual disease after surgery is not mandated for
study eligibility.18
Taking into account the possible influence of
bevacizumab on blood-brain barrier permeability
and vasogenic edema, the radiologic evaluation of
response to bevacizumab-based therapy remains a
challenge.17 By using standard MRI techniques we
found that in most cases both response and progression can be demonstrated by changes on both gadolinium-enhanced T1-weighted images and on FLAIR
images, whereas in a minority of patients alteration
of enhancement without changes on FLAIR was evident. We have not seen patients showing only FLAIR
improvement or deterioration, probably indicating
that the primary target of treatment was enhancing
tumor rather than infiltrative growth.
Irinotecan has been used for the treatment of
malignant glial tumors both as a single agent19–21
and in combination with other cytotoxic drugs,22 but
has shown only modest response rates and a marginal influence on PFS and OS. Presumably, the
impressive therapeutic influence of the reported protocol in high-grade gliomas, like in other solid can-

2271

cers, is because of a synergism between the cytotoxic
agent (irinotecan) and the biologic antiangiogenic
drug (bevacizumab).23 The major concern of using
this protocol in glioma patients is related to a relatively high previously reported complication rate,
including severe vascular thrombotic complications
even resulting in toxic deaths.13 We propose that a
higher dose of bevacizumab may be responsible for
vascular complications and speculate that a lower
dose of 5 mg/kg every 2 weeks may result in the
same efficacy but with a significantly lower (to none)
complication rate.
Clinical experience with bevacizumab includes
several phase 1 studies that examined its pharmacokinetics and toxicity as a single agent24 and in combination with different cytotoxic regimens.25
Although no dose-limiting toxicity was reported at
doses ranging from 3 to 20 mg/kg administered over
different time schedules, the doses of 5 to 15 mg/kg
every 2 to 3 weeks were arbitrarily chosen for most
phase 2 clinical trials. Only a few dose-escalating
phase 2 and 3 trials were performed aimed at estimating the optimal dose of the drug from the efficacy point of view.26–29 In a 3-arm randomized phase
2 trial, patients with advanced renal cell cancer were
treated either with high-dose (10 mg/kg of bevacizumab every 2 weeks) or low-dose (3 mg/kg every 2
weeks) versus placebo.27 High dose of the drug was
found to be significantly more effective in prolongation of median PFS as compared with low dose and
placebo, although no additional intermediate doses
between 3 and 10 mg/kg were examined. Another
randomized phase 2 study evaluated safety and efficacy of bevacizumab combined with 5-fluorouracil
and leucovorin (5FU/LV) in patients with metastatic
colorectal cancer.28 Patients were randomized either
to 5FU/LV alone or to a combination of 5FU/LV with
low-dose bevacizumab (5 mg/kg every 2 weeks) or
high-dose bevacizumab (10 mg/kg every 2 weeks). In
this study the use of low-dose bevacizumab was
associated with significantly better response rate and
median time-to progression, although thrombotic
complications were reported in all 3 arms of the trial.
According to the results of this study, the dose of
5 mg/kg every 2 weeks was selected for a major randomized phase 3 clinical trial of bevacizumab with
irinotecan and 5FU/LV as a first-line treatment for
metastatic colorectal cancer,30 and was approved as
a standard chemotherapy regimen for this patient
population. In a variety of clinical trials13,31–33 the
dose of bevacizumab was chosen empirically and no
dose escalation was performed.
In high-grade glial tumors the regimen initially
used by Stark-Vance12 was a 6-week cycle, bevacizu-

2272

mab 5 mg/kg every other week 3 2, and irinotecan
125 mg/m2 every week 3 4, followed by a 2-week
rest. In a recently published phase 2 study13 both
drugs were administered every other week on Days
1, 15, and 29 of a 6-week cycle. The dose of bevacizumab was 10 mg/kg and the dose of irinotecan (for
patients not receiving EIAED) was 125 mg/m2.
The mechanism of action and the pharmacologic
effects of biologic agents differ significantly from
classic cytotoxic drugs. The dose-response relation,
valid for cytotoxic drugs, has not been proven as an
appropriate mode for evaluating biologic agents,
including bevacizumab. Typical phase 1 clinical studies, designed primarily to evaluate dose-limiting
toxicities and maximal-tolerated dose (MTD) of drug,
are probably not ideal for estimating the clinically
optimal dose of drug for further clinical investigations of biological agents. Randomized dose-escalating phase 1–2 studies are a necessary step in clinical
development of new biologic agents before proceeding to larger phase 3 trials.
In our descriptive series of patients with recurrent high-grade glial tumors, as compared with the
results of Vredenburgh et al.,13 a lower dose of bevacizumab (5 mg/kg every 2 weeks) has been shown to
have comparable response rates and slightly inferior
6-month PFS (25% vs 38%), but is associated with
significantly fewer vascular side effects. Similar
results with the same dose of bevacizumab (5 mg/
kg) were recently reported at the 2007 ASCO Annual
Meeting.34 Although our series was not powered to
show statistically significant survival benefits, the
trends observed suggest consideration of alternative
dosing of antiangiogenic agents in future studies. It
may be that for biologic agents, bigger doses are not
always better.
