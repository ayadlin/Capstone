ABSTRACT
Background: Heterogeneous efficacy of neoadjuvant chemotherapy has led to
controversies that have limited its application in clinical practice. Thus, we aimed to
identify potential biomarkers predicting esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC)
chemo-responsiveness by gene expression profiling.
Methods: CCK8 assay was used to evaluate the growth inhibitory effect of different
concentrations of cisplatin and paclitaxel on the ESCC cell lines EC109, KYSE450,
KYSE410, KYSE510, and KYSE150 to differentiate between chemosensitive and
chemoresistant cell lines. Gene expression profiling and Real-time PCR were applied
to analyze and validate the gene expression differences between chemosensitive and
chemoresistant cell lines. IHC was conducted to examine the expression of selected
target markers MUC4, MUC13, and MUC20 in 186 ESCC resection samples and the
relationships between their expression and tumor regression grade was analyzed.
Moreover, RNAi was conducted to instantly block the expression of MUC4, MUC13,
and MUC20 to observe their influences on chemo-responsiveness.
Results: EC109 was found to be relatively sensitive to both cisplatin and
paclitaxel, while KYSE410 was relatively resistant to cisplatin, KYSE510 was relatively
resistant to paclitaxel. Gene expression profiling analysis showed that 2018 genes
were differentially expressed in sensitive cell line compared to resistant cell lines.
The expression patterns of MUC4, MUC13, MUC20 were validated. Low expression
of MUC4 and MUC20 in resection samples was significantly correlated with better
TRG. Blockage of MUC20 and MUC13 decreased the drug-resistance capacity and
chemosensitivity, respectively.
Conclusions: MUC4 and MUC20 were identified as potential biomarkers for
predicting the efficacy of neoadjuvant chemotherapy in ESCC patients.

INTRODUCTION

Neoadjuvant chemotherapy may be effective in
this regard, as the administration of therapeutic agents
before surgery might improve the prognosis of these
patients. Results of the prominent OEO2 clinical trial
conducted by MRC were published in Lancet in 2002 [1]
and updated in Journal of Clinical Oncology in 2009 [2].
These results demonstrated that the R0 resection rate was
higher in the group of patients treated with neoadjuvant
therapy plus surgery than in the group of patients treated

Esophageal cancer is a common malignancy for
which surgery is currently the major treatment approach.
However, for locally advanced stage patients, the 5-yr
survival rate remains as poor as 30% even after R0
resection. Hence, it is imperative that an additional
treatment be administered to support the major treatment
approach, with an aim to improve the survival rate.

that EC109 cell line was relatively sensitive either to
cis-platinum or paclitaxel, two of cell lines were
relatively resistant (KYSE410 and KYSE510) to
paclitaxel and cis-platinum, the remaining three cell
lines exhibited intermediate sensitivity to these two
agents (Figure 1).

with surgery alone. The median survival time of patients
administered neoadjuvant chemotherapy was longer
than that of patients treated with surgery alone, with the
2-yr survival rate being 43% and 34%, respectively.
Initial results of the RTOG8911 trial (USA inter group
113) conducted by Kelsen et al. were published in the
New England Journal of Medicine in 1998 [3]; these
results demonstrated that the patients analyzed did not
benefit from neoadjuvant chemotherapy, but their undated
data otherwise showed that prognosis of the patients who
responded to chemotherapy was better than that of patients
treated with surgery alone, with the median survival time
being 3 yr and 1.3 yr, respectively [4]. Hence, patients
may not always be sensitive to neoadjuvant chemotherapy;
in fact, for those who do not respond to chemotherapy, this
toxic treatment is of no benefit and could even be a curse.
Thus, predicting the efficacy of neoadjuvant chemotherapy
to identify chemosensitive patients is an issue that needs to
be addressed urgently.
Since 2000, gene microarray technology has been
applied to explore the drug-resistance mechanisms
of cancer cells towards cytotoxic drugs. Kudoh et al.
[5]. compared differences in gene expression at the
transcription level in adriamycin-sensitive and adriamycinresistant MCF-7 cells and identified potential key genes in
cytotoxic drug-resistant cells. Since then, researchers have
successively reported the responsiveness of tumor cells to
drugs at the transcription level. Previously, researchers
have conducted gene expression profiling analysis on
pretreatment gastroscopic biopsy specimens of esophageal
cancer (most were adenocarcinoma) and attempted to
identify genes that could be used to predict sensitivity to
neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy [6–10].
In the current study, we conducted gene expression
profiling analysis on 5 esophageal squamous cell
carcinoma (ESCC) cell lines that responded differentially
to chemotherapeutics to identify neoadjuvant chemoresponsiveness associated genes. Real-time PCR was
performed to validate the differentially expressed genes
identified in gene expression profiling analysis as targeted
markers were selected. IHC was then conducted to assess
their expression in resection samples to analyze their
relationship with tumor regression grade (TRG), which
could reflect chemo-responsiveness, and to evaluate their
applicability in predicting neoadjuvant chemosensitivity.

Microarray analysis and validation
Microarray were used to analyze the gene
expression profile in ESCC cell lines. Then, the
difference between the relatively sensitive and resistant
cell lines on the basal level of expression of each gene
was observed. To investigate the genetic variance
between cell lines, intensity of each gene in sensitive
cell line was divided by that in resistant cell line,
and the absolute value of ratio ≥ 1.8 was defined as
difference threshold. It was showed that significantly
differential expression of 1446 genes was observed
in EC109 compared with KYSE410; significantly
differential expression of 1386 genes was observed
in EC109 compared with KYSE510 (Figure 2).
As the combination of multiple agents is becoming
increasingly common, to identify gene expression
profiles predictive of response to multiple agents could
be more useful to make clinical decisions regarding the
specific combination of therapies. Therefore, the union
of these two sets of differentially expressed genes was
used as final results. And a total of 2081 genes were
differentially expressed between the relatively sensitive
and resistant cell lines.
To determine whether these identified genes play
a role in specific biological processes, we performed
a pathway-net analysis. We found that genes involved
in processes, including PI3K-Akt signaling pathway,
Mucin type O-glycan biosynthesis, TGF-β signaling
pathway, mTOR signaling pathway, were enriched in
the sets of genes correlated with chemotherapy agents
response (Figure 3).
To confirm the microarray data, 6 differentially
expressed genes which were involved with the
signaling pathways important to carcinogenesis were
selected, and their difference in expression across the
panel of 3 cell lines (EC109, KYSE410, KYSE510)
was confirmed by quantitative real-time PCR. The
expression trends 4 of these 6 genes in real-time PCR
were consistent with the results from microarray
analysis (Figure 4).

expression on protein level with resected tumor tissue.
MUC4 and MUC20 expression were mainly located
in cytoplasm (Figure 5), and found in positively 62.4%
(116/186) and 38.2% (71/186) of cases, respectively.
There was significant correlation between expression
of MUC4 and MUC20 with TRG in postoperative
specimens. Patients with low expression of MUC4 or
MUC20 would have a good tumor regression and fewer
residual cancer cells (Tables 1 and 2).

In consideration of the downregulation of MUC4
and MUC20 in relatively sensitive cell line EC109,
as well as the upregulation of MUC13 in relatively
sensitive cell line EC109, we hypothesized that MUC
may be involved in chemotherapy response. To further
investigated the effects of MUC on chemotherapy

response, we developed a transient cell strain with
konckdown of MUC4, MUC13 or MUC20 by transient
transfection with siRNA targeted toward MUC4,
MUC13 or MUC20, respectively. Real-time PCR
showed that MUC4, MUC13 or MUC20 expression
were obviously decreased. Then, the cells were
treated with the IC50 concentration of cis-platinum
or paclitaxel and the cell viability were measured.
Knockdown of MUC13 in sensitive cell line EC109
resulted in increased cell survival and inhibited
chemosensitivity, whereas, knockdown of MUC20 in
resistant cell line KYSE510 promoted cell apoptosis and
induced cells more chemosensitive to agent (Figure 6).
However, knockdown of MUC4 did not affect cell
chemosensitivity.

blocking gene expression on drug-resistance capacity were
elucidated.
Neoadjuvant chemotherapy plus surgery has
become the standard treatment approach for locally
advanced esophageal cancer. However, the heterogeneous
efficacy of neoadjuvant chemotherapy among esophageal
cancer patients has impeded its widespread applicability.
Moreover, while the long-term survival of chemosensitive
patients improves, for chemoresistant patients,
neoadjuvant chemotherapy not only fails to improve longterm survival, it could also be a curse for some patients
who had a poorer prognosis than patients treated with
surgery alone. Thus, predicting the efficacy of neoadjuvant
chemotherapy and identifying chemosensitive patients to
avoid over-treatment of chemoresistant patients are vital.
In recent years, researchers have tried to identify
indicators that could be used to predict the efficacy of
neoadjuvant chemotherapy so that these indicators
can be considered biomarkers; however, despite these
research efforts [12–21], no unanimously recognized
molecular biomarkers are currently available for use
in clinical practice. Along with the development of
high-throughput gene sequencing technology, genetic
tests have been widely applied to screen for genes
associated with complicated diseases and to predict the
efficacy of treatment and estimate the prognosis of the
disease.

DISCUSSION
In this study, we aimed to identify neoadjuvant
chemo-responsiveness-associated genes by conducting
gene expression profiling analysis on 5 ESCC cell lines.
We demonstrated the differences in the sensitivity to
both cis-platinum and paclitaxel among the cell lines,
and gene expression profiling analysis showed the
differences in gene expression patterns of chemosensitive
and chemoresistant cell lines. Moreover, the relationship
between expression levels and TRG and the effect of

The current study conducted gene expression
profiling analysis in multiple ESCC cell lines possessing
different chemo-responsiveness by using cDNA array
technology. The obtained results showed that many genes
were differentially expressed, among which the expression
of more than 200 genes was differentiated, with more than
5-fold difference in expression being observed. Pathwaynet was used to analyze the signal pathways in which
the differentially expressed genes were involved. The
results showed that the number of pathways involving
differentially expressed genes was as many as 178,
among which 31 signal pathways were associated with
the development and progression of cancer (17.4%). This
indicates that the genetic information in chemosensitive
and chemoresistant cell lines was indeed different.
We selected 6 genes (MUC4, MUC13, MUC20,
BMP7, AKT3, and SMAD3) that were closely associated
with the development and progression of cancer to
validate the conclusions drawn from the gene expression
profiling analysis. The results showed that the observed
mRNA expression of 4 genes (MUC4, MUC13, MUC20,
and BMP7) in chemosensitive and chemoresistant cell
lines was in concordance with the results of the gene
expression profiling analysis, indicating that the results
of the gene expression profiling analysis are reliable.
We further validated the expression of MUC4, MUC13,
MUC 20, and BMP7 at the mRNA level in the tumor
tissues of 2 chemosensitive and 3 chemoresistant ESCC
patients before chemotherapy; the results showed that
MUC4, MUC20, and BMP7 were expressed at low levels,
while MUC13 was over-expressed in the tumor tissues
of patients who responded to chemotherapy. This was
consistent with the results obtained from the experiments
conducted using cell lines. Based on these findings,
we considered the MUC family members as potential
biomarkers and evaluated their protein expression in 186
paraffin-embedded tumor tissue samples obtained from
patients who were treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

and surgery and analyzed the relationship between their
expression levels and TRG. The results demonstrated
that MUC4 and MUC20 were expressed at low levels in
the tumor tissue samples obtained from chemosensitive
patients (TRG1/2/3), whereas the expression of MUC13
did not significantly correlate with TRG. In our previous
study, we had analyzed the relation between the expression
of MUC memebers and the prognosis of this set of 186
patients and found that the patients with high MUC13/
low MUC20 expression had longer median survival
time. Since only patients with better chemotherapy
response could benefit from neoadjuvant chemotherapy,
theoretically, they would have longer survival time. In
this study, the patients with better TRG had low MUC20
expression, meanwhile, these patients had favourable
prognosis.
Mucins, a group of high-molecular weight
transmembrane O-linked glycoproteins secreted by
epithelia, are abnormally expressed in many malignancies
[22]. Owing to their high molecular weight, the fact that
they are heavily glycosylated, and their cell membrane
location, mucins could play a role in protecting the cells
by acting as a barrier and preventing external substances
including anti-tumor drugs from entering the cells.
Therefore, mucins have been thought to be potential
targets in drug resistance-related research. Bafna et al.
[23]. found that the MUC4 gene could inhibit apoptosis
and promote cell proliferation by activating the antiapoptosis pathways, which resulted in the development of
gemcitabine resistance in pancreatic cancer patients. The
anti-apoptotic effect of MUC4 was demonstrated by the
phosphorylation of kinases regulated by her2/extracellular
signals and the inactivation of the proapoptotic protein
Bad. Hu et al. [24]. found that compared to melanoma
cell lines showing a low expression of MUC4, cell
lines overexpressing MUC4 were resistant to various
chemotherapeutics such as paclitaxel, adriamycin, and
vinblastine. The possible underlying mechanism is that

the expression of MUC4 could inhibit apoptosis by
the activation of caspase-9, which further resulted in
the development of drug resistance in tumor cells. To
our knowledge, currently, there are no studies on the
applicability of MUC family genes to the prediction of
neoadjuvant chemosensitivity in ESCC patients. We
found that MUC4 and MUC20 were expressed at low
levels, and MUC13 was over-expressed in chemosensitive
ESCC cell lines. By the in vitro experiment, we found that
blocking of MUC4 and MUC20 could contribute to the
increase in the sensitivity of ESCC cell lines to paclitaxel,
whereas blocking of MUC13 resulted in a decrease in the
sensitivity of ESCC cell lines to paclitaxel. These results
further indicate that the MUC family genes are potential
biomarkers in predicting the efficacy of chemotherapy for
ESCC patients.
Although some studies have already reported the
applications of gene expression profiling analysis in
identifying neoadjuvant chemosensitivity-associated
biomarkers of ESCC, the current study puts forth some
novel findings: 1. Most of the studies enrolled patients
treated with neoadjuvant chemoradiation and surgery
instead of patients treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy
and surgery. 2. The pathological type of the cancer in the
patients was adenocarcinoma; therefore, information
with respect to esophageal squamous cell carcinoma is
lacking. To our knowledge, only one study by Motoori
[25] evaluated neoadjuvant chemotherapy in ESCC, in
which gene expression profiling analysis was performed
using pretreatment fresh biopsy specimens obtained from
25 ESCC patients who received neoadjuvant therapy and
the neoadjuvant chemotherapy responsiveness-predicting
model, which involved 199 differentially expressed
genes, was constructed. It is noteworthy that some
differentially expressed genes such as TCEA3, IFI6, and
PEP overlapped between the two studies; this aspect needs
to be further validated in the future.
The current study also has some limitations. Owing
to the difficulties in procuring large biopsy specimens
before surgery, we were left with no choice but to
use postoperative paraffin-embedded samples for our
clinical validation. Therefore, it is uncertain whether
chemotherapy could change the expression of these genes.
Despite the shortcomings of the study, the results obtained
still amount to powerful evidence regarding molecular
biomarkers that could be used to predict the efficacy of
neoadjuvant chemotherapy in ESCC patients. In the

CCK8 assay
Cells were plated in 96-well plates at a density
of 10,000 cells per well in 100 μl of complete medium
and grown overnight. Then the cells were treated with
gradient dilution of cis-platinum (0.333, 1, 3, 9, 27,
81 μg/ml) and paclitaxel (0.001, 0.005, 0.025, 0.125,
0.625, 3.125, 15.625, 78.125 μM) in 100 μl medium.
After 48 h of incubation, a total of 100 μl of Cell
Counting Kit-8(CCK8) reagent (Dojindo) was added
to each well. After 4 h of incubation at 37°C, the
absorbance of per well was measured at 450 nm using
a VERS Amax Microplate Reader (Molecular Devices
Corp, Sunnyvale, CA).
Microarray analysis
For Affymetrix microarray profiling, total
RNA was isolated with Trizol reagent (Invitrogen,
Canada) and purified using RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen,
German), including a DNase digestion treatment. RNA
concentrations were determined by the absorbance at
260 nm and quality control standards were A260/A280
= 1.8–2.1, using NanoDrop 2000 (Thermo, America).
cDNA of cell lines KYSE510, KYSE410, and EC109
was hybridized to GeneChip Human Transcriptome
Array 2.0 (Affymetrix, America) according to the User
Manuals.Affymetrix® Expression Console Software
(version 1.2.1) was used for microarray analysis. Raw
data (CEL files) were normalized at transcript level
using robust multiaverage method (RMA workflow).
Median summarization of transcript expressions was
calculated. Gene-level data was then filtered to include
only those probe sets that are in the ‘core’ metaprobe
list, which represent RefSeq genes.
Quantitative real-time PCR
Total RNA was was reverse-transcribed using the
Reverse Transcription System (Thermo scientific com). The
reverse transcription reaction was performed sequentially for
60 min at 42°C, and for 5 min at 70°C. Real-time PCR was
performed using SYBR Green. PCR runs and fluorescence
detection were performed in a Rotor-Gene 6000 Real-Time
PCR system (Applied Biosystems). The sequences of the
real-time PCR primers were as follows: MUC4: forward

Patients and specimens
Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) blocks
of postoperative specimens of 186 successive ESCC
patients who underwent neoadjuvant chemotherapy
followed by surgery in a single-surgeon team between
January 2000 and December 2012 at the Department of
Thoracic Surgery I, Peking University Cancer Hospital
were obtained. All of the patients presented ESCCs at
stage T2–3N1M0. This study was approved by both
the Ethics and the Academic committees of Peking
University School of Oncology, and informed consent
was obtained from all patients.

RNA inference and cell transfection
For knock-down of MUC4 MUC13 or MUC20
expression in KYSE510, siRNA was used. The
oligonucleotides containing MUC siRNA sequences were
synthesized (GenePharma Com). MUC13 siRNA sequences
were 5′-GCGUGCUGAUGACAC GUUUTT- 3′ and
5′-AAACUUGUCAUCAGCACGCTT -3′, MUC4 siRNA
sequences were 5′-GCUGGAAUGACAAGCCCUATT-3′
and 5′- UAGGGCUUGU CAUUCCAGCTT-3′, MUC20
siRNA sequence were 5′-GCGCCUCACUUCCAG
GUCUTT-3′, and 5′- AGACCUGGAAGUGAGGCGCTT-3′.
Cells were plated (3 × 105 cells) in a 6-well plate and grown
overnight to 50% confluence, and then transfected with
100 μl medium containing siRNA targeting MUC4, MUC20
gene or scrambled siRNA. After 48 h, the total RNA was
isolated for real-time PCR.

Neoadjuvant chemotherapy
Platinum-based 2-drug combination, mainly
the paclitaxel and cis-platinum with the proportion of
95%, was used in neoadjuvant chemotherapy. On day 1,
paclitaxel at a dose of 175 mg/m2 of body surface
area was administered intravenously. On days 1–3,
cis-platinum at a dose of 25 mg/m2 of body surface
area was administered intravenously, a single
course of treatment lasted 21 d. Enhanced chest
computed tomography (CT) and esophagography
were used to evaluate the curative effects of the
treatment. Approximately 1–4 cycles of neoadjuvant
chemotherapy were administered before surgery.
Among them, 64.6% received 2 cycles (120/186).

Immunohistochemistry
After routine deparaffinization and hydration,
tissue sections were treated with 3% hydrogen peroxide
and then heated in citrate buffer (pH 6.0) for antigen
retrieval. The MUC4 or MUC20 antigen-antibody
reaction took place overnight at 4°C, following
goat serum blocking. The streptavidin/Peroxidase
amplification kit (Zymed) was applied to detect the
signal of the MUC4 or MUC20 antigen-antibody
reaction. Peroxidase activity was developed with
diaminobenzidine. All sections were counterstained
with hematoxylin. The purified rabbit polyclonal
antibody against human MUC4 or MUC20 (Abcam)
was used at 1:200 and 1:100 respectively, and
goat anti-rabbit biotin-conjugated IgG was used as
secondary antibody. Immunohistochemical signals
were scored by two independent observers. The
scores were calculated multiplying the staining
intensity and extent. The staining intensity was
categorized by relative intensity as follows: 0,
negative; 1, weak; 2, moderate; and 3, strong. The
proportion of cells proteins expression was categorized
as follows: 0, < 10% immunopositive cells; 1,

Tumor regression grade assessment
All enrolled subjects were reviewed again by
two experienced pathologists who were blinded to
the clinical information and gene expression. Tumor
regression grade (TRG) was graded on 4-point scale
based on the histologic tumor response assessment
described by Mandard [11]. This assessment was
defined as: grade I, no residual tumor cells; grade II,
nearly complete response with < 10% vital residual
tumor cells (VRTC); grade III, 10%–50% VRTC; and
grade IV, > 50% VRTC.
Statistical analysis
SPSS 19.0 software was used to perform the
statistical analyses. All in vitro experiments were
performed at least thrice in triplicates. When the data

and homogeneity of variance were checked first, and
then an unpaired two-tailed t test analysis was used.
Bars and error bars on the graphs as well as data in
the text represent the mean ± SD. The correlation
between gene expression and tumor regression grade
(TRG), as well as between gene expression and
clinicopathological downstage was evaluated by
chi-squared test.
