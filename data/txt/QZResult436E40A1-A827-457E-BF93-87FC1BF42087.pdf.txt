ABSTRACT
Recently, agonists targeting multiple peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors
(PPARs) have been developed to improve metabolic disorders and minimize the side
effects of selective PPAR agonists such as weight gain and dyslipidemia. We newly
synthesized six 2-methyl-2-(o-tolyloxy)propanoic acid derivatives based on the
structure of a well-known PPAR pan agonist, bezafibrate. Of six compounds, MHY2013
was screened as the strongest activator of three PPAR subtypes based on protein
docking simulation and luciferase assays. When treated orally in db/db mice, MHY2013
ameliorated obesity-induced insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, and hepatic steatosis
without changes of the body weight and levels of liver and kidney injury markers.
MHY2013 decreased the serum triglyceride and fatty acid levels, which is associated
with an increase in fatty acid oxidation signaling in the liver and thermogenic signaling
on white adipose tissue, respectively. Furthermore, MHY2013 markedly increased
serum levels of insulin-sensitizing hormones including fibroblast growth factor 21
(FGF21) and adiponectin. In conclusion, this study suggests that, MHY2013 is a novel
PPAR pan agonist that improves obesity-induced insulin resistance, dyslipidemia and
hepatic steatosis and elevates insulin-sensitizing hormones in the blood.

PPARs are among the most remarkable targets for the
treatment of metabolic syndrome [5]. Consequently, PPAR
subtype agonists are in clinical use for metabolic diseases,
including type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, etc. [6].
However, unresolved issues exist for each PPAR subtype
agonist. Fibrate-type drugs targeting PPARα are associated
with hepatic toxicity, cholelithiasis, and myopathy, which
limit their wider application in patients [7]. In the case of
PPARγ selectively agonistic glitazone-type drugs, side
effects such as dyslipidemia, heart failure, and weight
gain have been reported in clinical stages [7]. Among
those, rosiglitazone was even withdrawn in Europe, and

INTRODUCTION
Each PPAR subtype plays a pivotal role in regulating
tissue metabolism in hormone-dependent and independent
manners [1]. PPARα is mainly expressed in the liver,
muscle, and heart, stimulating β-oxidation and energy
expenditure [2–4], whereas PPARγ is highly expressed in
adipose tissue where it regulates adipocyte differentiation
and insulin sensitivity [2, 3]. Although biological
functions of the ubiquitously expressed PPARβ/δ need to
be elucidated, diverse studies have suggested its role in
regulating lipid homeostasis and energy utilization. The

its use has been restricted in the USA. Clinical and animal
studies have demonstrated beneficial effects of PPAR
dual and pan agonists, with fewer side effects compared
to selective PPAR agonistic drugs, possibly by providing
complementary effects [8]. Hence, development of PPAR
dual/pan agonistic drugs capable of balanced activation
of each PPAR subtype may offer a fascinating therapeutic
option. In line with this, we newly synthesized and screened
six 2-methyl-2-(o-tolyloxy)propanoic acid derivatives
as candidates for PPAR pan agonists and examined their
effects on insulin resistance and dyslipidemia in genetically
obese db/db mice. Our data showed that MHY2013 was
the strongest PPAR pan agonist among them. MHY2013
elevated blood FGF21 and adiponectin and increased
adipose tissue browning, thereby contributing to improved
obesity-induced insulin resistance, hepatic steatosis, and
dyslipidemia without affecting body weight. Our study
provides a molecular rationale for further development of
MHY2013 as treatment of metabolic disorders.

PPARβ/δ: GW501516, and PPARγ: rosiglitazone)
(Figure  1). In addition, MHY2013 dose-dependently
increased luciferase activities for the three PPAR subtypes,
suggesting that the compound strongly activates all PPAR
subtypes (Supplementary Figure 1).

MHY2013 can directly bind to three PPAR
subtypes
To investigate whether MHY2013 can bind to the
three PPAR subtypes, docking simulation was conducted
using the AutoDock 4.2 program. The structure images
of the three PPAR subtypes from the docking simulation
showed that MHY2013 might directly bind to the three
PPAR subtypes (Figure 2A, B, C). To predict the binding
energy, the docking topologies of WY14643, GW501516,
rosiglitazone, and MHY2013 were simulated to the cocrystal structure of each PPAR subtype. The binding
affinities of WY14643, GW501516, and rosiglitazone to
PPARα, PPARβ/δ, and PPARγ, respectively, were −7.93,
−9.68, and −8.03 kcal/mol, respectively, whereas the binding
affinities of MHY2013 to PPARα, PPARβ/δ, and PPARγ
were −7.94, −9.2, and −8.69 kcal/mol, respectively (Figure
2A, B, C). These results suggest that the binding affinity
of MHY2013 to each PPAR subtype may be comparable
to that of the positive controls. To predict the binding
residues of the three PPAR subtypes, which correlated
for each positive control and MHY2013, the LigandScout
3.1 program was used. MHY2013 might form a hydrogen
bond with the TYR464A residue and hydrophobic bonds
with the ILE354A, PHE273A, LEU460A, LEU456A, and
VAL444A residues of PPARα (Figure 2D). In the case of
PPAR β/δ, MHY2013 might form hydrogen bonds with the
CYS285A and THR292A residues and hydrophobic bonds
with the THR268A, ILE333A, LEU330A, and ILE326

RESULTS
MHY2013 is a potent PPAR pan agonist in vitro
To search for powerful PPAR pan agonists, we
newly synthesized six 2-methyl-2-(o-tolyloxy)propanoic
acid derivatives based on the structure of the well-known
PPAR pan agonist bezafibrate (Supplementary Method
1 and Supplementary Table 1 ). The PPRE-luciferase
assays for the three PPAR subtypes were performed
using YPEN-1 cells to screen for the strongest PPAR pan
agonist. Among the six derivatives, MHY2013 had the
highest luciferase activities for all PPAR subtypes, and its
effect on each PPAR subtype was comparable to that of
each specific PPAR subtype agonist (PPARα: WY14643,

residues (Figure 2E). MHY2013 might interact with PPARγ
by forming an aromatic bond with the ARG288D residue
and hydrophobic bonds with the ILE326D, TYR327D,
PHE282D, LEU469D, and TYR473D residues (Figure
2F). In particular, MHY2013 formed hydrophobic bonds
with the ILE354A residue of PPARα, LEU330A residue
of PPARβ/δ, and ILE326D residue of PPARγ, in common
with each PPAR subtype agonist (Figure 2D, E, F). These
data indicate that MHY2013 may directly bind to all PPAR
subtypes with affinities comparable to those of well-known
PPAR subtype agonists.

suggesting that MHY2013 has no severe toxicity for the
liver and kidney. Then, we examined its effect on the blood
profile associated with glucose and lipid metabolism.
As expected, triglyceride (TG), non-esterified fatty acid
(NEFA), fasting glucose, and circulating insulin levels
highly increased in the db/db mice compared with the
db/m mice, confirming the development of dyslipidemia
and insulin resistance in the db/db mice (Figure 3F, G,
I, J). However, MHY2013 reduced the serum levels of
TGs and NEFAs in the db/db mice (Figure 3F, G). The
GTT showed that MHY2013 improved the obesityinduced glucose intolerance (Figure 3H). Moreover, the
MHY2013 treatment significantly reduced the fasting
blood glucose and serum insulin levels in the db/db mice,
without affecting the body weight (Figure 3I, J). These
results suggest that MHY2013 improves obesity-induced
dyslipidemia and insulin resistance, and the improvement
is not a secondary effect of the body weight reduction.

MHY2013 increases transcriptional activity of
three PPAR subtypes
To investigate whether MHY2013 has cytotoxicity
that was reported in some well-known PPAR agonists,
including fenofibrate and pioglitazone, we carried
out 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium
bromide (MTT) assays and proved that MHY2013 had
no cytotoxicity (up to 10 μM) in YEPN-1 cells during 24h
incubation (Figure 2G). Because PPARs activated by ligand
binding are translocated to the nucleus, we investigated
whether MHY2013 induced translocation of PPARs to
the nucleus. Immunofluorescence staining revealed that
the nuclear distribution of the three PPAR subtypes were
increased in the MHY2013-treated groups compared with
those treated with the vehicle (DMSO) and each PPAR
positive control (Supplementary Figure 2). Furthermore,
western blotting results showed that the nuclear protein levels
of the three PPAR subtypes were increased dose-dependently
by the MHY2013 treatment (Figure 2H). Consistently, the
mRNA levels of the target genes of PPARα (ACOX1 and
CPT1), PPARβ/δ (PDK4 and HMGCS2), and PPARγ (SCD1
and ACC) were significantly elevated by the MHY2013
treatment (Figure 2I). These results confirm that MHY2013
is a strong PPAR pan agonist targeting all PPAR subtypes.

Effects of MHY2013 on liver of obese mice
Hepatic steatosis is commonly found together
with insulin resistance in obesity. We examined the
beneficial effect of MHY2013 on the liver and found that
the compound ameliorated the obesity-induced hepatic
steatosis as evidenced by a significant decrease in the
hepatic TG concentration (Figure 4A). As a potential
factor underlying the MHY2013-mediated decrease in the
hepatic TG level, we investigated AMP-activated protein
kinase (AMPK)/β-oxidation signaling because diverse
studies have indicated that all PPAR subtypes induce
AMPK activation through various mechanisms, such as
a physical interaction, phosphorylation, and upregulation
of AMPK activation-related proteins [9]. Phosphorylation
of AMPKα1/2 (Thr172) was significantly increased in the
liver but not adipose tissue and muscle of the MHY2013treated db/db mice compared to those of the vehicle-treated
db/db mice (Figure 4B and Supplementary Figure 3A, B).
Moreover, MHY2013 induced phosphorylation of LKB1
(Ser431) known as upstream of AMPK in the liver (Figure
4C). Consistently, the mRNA expression levels of fatty
acid oxidation-related genes, including ACOX1, CPT1,
HMGCS2, and PDK4, were increased in the livers of the
MHY2013-treated db/db mice (Figure 4D), indicating that
the increased AMPK/β-oxidation signaling contributes to
the improvement of hepatic steatosis.
FGF21 is a recently described hepatokine,
primarily regulated by PPARα. Numerous studies have
revealed the pharmaceutical importance of FGF21 for
treating metabolic syndrome, which is due to its strong
insulin-sensitizing and thermogenic effects on adipose
tissues [10]. Because it is possible that MHY2013
activates PPARα via direct binding, we examined
whether the compound stimulated the FGF21 production
in the liver. The data showed that the mRNA expression

Effects of MHY2013 on blood profile and insulin
sensitivity in obesity model
Obesity is generally accompanied by severe
alterations in blood nutrient and metabolite profiles,
which are closely related to metabolic syndrome,
including insulin resistance and dyslipidemia. To evaluate
the beneficial effects of MHY2013 on the blood profile,
genetically obese db/db mice were administered with
MHY2013 (5 mg/kg/day) by oral gavage for three weeks.
There were no differences in the food intake and body
weight between the groups (Figure 3A, B). We first tested
whether MHY2013 had toxic effects in vivo. Serum
aspartate transaminase (AST) and alanine transaminase
(ALT) level used to detect the liver injury and the serum
creatinine level used to detect the renal injury were
unaffected by the MHY2013 treatment (Figure 3C, D, E),

levels of FGF21 were markedly increased in the livers
of the db/db mice by the MHY2013 treatment (Figure
4E). Consistently, the serum level of FGF21 was also
elevated by MHY2013 (Figure 4F). The FGF21–
luciferase assay using HepG2 cells further revealed
that MHY2013 highly increased the FGF21–luciferase
activity to the level comparable to that of the PPARα
agonist WY14643-treated group (Figure 4G). These
data indicate that the MHY2013-mediated activation of

PPARα transcriptionally upregulates FGF21 in the liver,
contributing to the FGF21 increase in blood.

PPAR subtypes have been shown to affect adipocyte
metabolism. Indeed, a strong thermogenic effect of FGF21

on adipose tissues has been well established. To reveal the
net effects of MHY2013 on white adipose tissue (WAT),
we examined various signaling pathways related to fatty
acid oxidation, thermogenesis, and inflammation.
The mRNA expression levels of browning markers
such as UCP1 and CIDEA were significantly increased in
adipose tissue of the MHY2013-treated db/db mice compared
with the vehicle-treated db/db mice (Figure 5A). Other
browning markers, such as PGC1-α, CD137, and SLC27A1,
also showed a tendency to be slightly increased by MHY2013
(Figure 5A). To check whether MHY2013 directly induces
the browning of white adipocytes, 3T3-L1 pre-adipocytes
and primary adipocytes isolated from subcutaneous fat of
C57/BL6 mice were differentiated into adipocytes for seven
days with or without MHY2013. As a result, MHY2013
dose-dependently increased the mRNA levels of browning
markers such as UCP1, CIDEA, and PGC1-α in the 3T3-L1
and primary adipocytes (Figure 5B, C). To further examine
the adipose browning effect of MHY2013, we observed the
morphology of lipid droplets because brown adipocytes
are characterized by a multi-locular lipid droplet structure.
MHY2013 appeared to alter the morphology of adipocytes
toward a multi-locular lipid droplet structure in 3T3-L1
cells (Supplementary Figure 4A). These data suggest that
MHY2013 induces browning of WAT.
One of the important functions of adipose tissue
is secretion of adipokines to regulate systemic nutrient
metabolism. Adiponectin is probably one of the bestknown adipokines, which elevates the insulin sensitivity
and fatty acid oxidation and reduces the inflammation.
Indeed, it has been shown that beneficial effects of PPAR
subtype agonists are partially mediated via increasing
adiponectin levels. Because adiponectin gene expression
in adipocytes is induced by all three PPAR subtypes, we
evaluated adiponectin levels in the MHY2013-treated
db/db mice. MHY2013 notably increased the mRNA

expression level of adiponectin in adipose tissue (Figure
5D). Consistently, the blood adiponectin level was higher
in the MHY2013-treated than in the vehicle-treated db/
db mice (Figure 5E). To investigate whether MHY2013
directly regulates the level of adiponectin in adipocytes,
we measured the adiponectin mRNA expression level
in MHY2013-treated 3T3-L1 adipocytes. The mRNA
expression of adiponectin was greatly increased by
MHY2013 in the 3T3-L1 cells (Figure 5F). These data
demonstrate that the MHY2013-mediated increase in
adiponectin levels contributes to the improvement of
obesity-related insulin resistance and dyslipidemia.
To further examine the effects of MHY2013 on
adipose tissue, we determined the mRNA expression
levels of genes associated with fatty acid oxidation and
inflammation signaling pathways. The mRNA expression
levels of fatty acid oxidation-related genes (ACOX1,CPT1,
HMGCS2, and PDK4) were increased in adipose tissue
of the MHY2013-treated db/db mice and 3T3-L1 cells
(Figure 5G and Supplementary Figure 4B). MHY2013
also reduced the mRNA expression levels of inflammatory
genes such as MCP1 and TNF-α (Figure 5H). Although we
showed that the MHY2013 treatment increased the FGF21
expression in the liver, no significant change in FGF21
expression was observed in adipose tissue (Supplementary
Figure 4C). Together, these data indicate that MHY2013
not only stimulates the metabolic pathways for energy
expenditure but also inhibits inflammatory signaling,
thereby contributing to maintaining metabolically healthy
adipose tissue.

mice

effects on skeletal muscle, we measured mRNA

expression levels of fatty acid oxidation-related genes and
irisin, a recently identified myokine that improves obesityrelated metabolic syndrome. MHY2013 increased mRNA
expression levels of ACOX1, CPT1, HMGCS2, and irisin
in the skeletal muscle (Figure 6A and 6B). Although
further studies are necessary for proving beneficial effects
of MHY2013 on skeletal muscle, these data shows that
MHY2013 may increase fatty acid oxidation and irisin
production in skeletal muscle.

but the mRNA expression of FGF21 did not change in
the the WAT. Therefore, we assume that the liver is the
main contributor to the increase in serum FGF21 level
by MHY2013 treatment. Besides FGF21, a well-known
insulin-sensitizing hormone adiponectin is also increased
in the serum of the MHY2013-treated mice possibly due
to the upregulation of adiponectin expression in WAT.
Considering MHY2013 elevated the mRNA expression of
adiponectin in 3T3-L1 adipocyte cells, the compound may
directly upregulate adiponectin expression in adipocytes
by activating PPARγ that are well-known regulators of
adiponectin transcription [19].
Moreover, MHY2013 induced AMPK activation
in the liver. Because AMPK activation has been shown
to stimulate the energy expenditure, including fatty acid
oxidation, the MHY2013-mediated increase in fatty acid
oxidation signaling is likely associated with the AMPK
activation in the liver. Furthermore, it is very likely that the
utilization of fatty acids in the liver may contribute to the
reduced TG level in circulation in the MHY2013-treated
mice because it has been reported that the increased fatty
acid oxidation in the liver lowers serum lipid levels [20].
Adipose tissue browning is important for
ameliorating obesity-related metabolic diseases because it
prevents the excessive energy storage and inflammation
by dissipating energy through heat [21]. MHY2013
increased the fatty acid oxidation and browning-related
gene expression and decreased the inflammatory
gene expression in WAT of the obese mice. Thus, it is
likely that the fatty acid oxidation-derived energy may
be dissipated through heat generation as a result of
MHY2013 treatment. Furthermore, the increase in fatty
acid oxidation and thermogenic signaling in WAT may
contribute to the notable decrease in circulating NEFA
levels in the MHY2013-treated db/db mice. However, the
mechanisms underlying MHY2013-mediated increase in
WAT browning signaling are not directly examined in the
current study. Considering other studies showing that all
PPAR subtypes stimulate WAT browning with hormonedependent and -independent manners [21–24], we assume
that the MHY2013-mediated increases in the expression of
WAT browning markers and the formation of multi-locular
lipid droplets in WAT are probably due to the MHY2013
agonism for all PPAR subtypes in multiple tissues and
the PPAR agonism-dependent secretion of thermogenic
activators, including FGF21 and adiponectin.
Although thermogenic signaling was increased in
WAT, the body weight was unaltered in the mice treated
with MHY2013. We assume that the WAT browning effect
of MHY2013 may not be strong enough to reduce body
weight or that other effects of all three PPAR subtype
agonism by MHY2013 may offset the WAT browningmediated body weight regulation. For instance, FGF21
has been shown to decrease body weight and improve
metabolic profile in obese mice [25, 26]. On the other
hand, adiponectin ameliorates metabolic profile although

DISCUSSION
Through in silico docking simulation and multiple
biological analysis, we screened MHY2013 as the
strongest agonist for all PPAR subtypes among six
2-methyl-2-(o-tolyloxy)propanoic acid derivatives. When
injected orally in db/db mice, MHY2013 greatly improved
obesity-induced insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, and
hepatic steatosis without a change in body weight and
apparent signs of hepatic or renal toxicity. Although the
underlying mechanisms should be diverse considering
numerous effects of PPARs in multiple tissues, the
elevation of beneficial hormones including FGF21
and adiponectin, WAT browning signaling, and fatty
acid oxidation signaling in liver and skeletal muscle
may synergistically contribute to the beneficial effects
of MHY2013. Thus, MHY2013 may be a novel
pharmaceutical agent that can be used for intervention in
obesity-induced metabolic syndrome.
Previous studies have revealed that there are major
drawbacks in selective PPAR agonists, such as a body
weight gain and dyslipidemia. As an alternative, drugs
targeting multiple PPARs have been developed. Although
bezafibrate was first clinically tested as a PPAR pan
agonist to improve metabolic disorders [11, 12], they
caused some mooted points like severe hepatic and renal
toxicity and low potency [13, 14]. Our data showed that
MHY2013 did not accompany the known side effects
including body weight gain and hepatic and renal toxicity.
When compared to a PPAR α/γ dual agonist MHY908
[15, 16], MHY2013 appears to be a stronger activator
for PPARs than MHY908 (unpublished data). We assume
that the balanced activation of three PPAR subtypes by
MHY2013 may contribute to the beneficial effects on
metabolic syndrome with minimizing known side effects
by other PPAR agonists.
The PPAR subtypes regulate the expression of
endocrine hormones that can influence glucose and lipid
metabolism [17]. FGF21 is a hormone secreted from
the liver and adipose tissues in response to activation
of PPARα and PPARγ respectively. FGF21 has been
considered a promising intervention target for metabolic
diseases, including fatty liver, obesity, and diabetes due to
its insulin-sensitizing and thermogenesis-inducing effects
[18]. Our data showed that FGF21 was increased in the
liver and serum of the MHY2013-treated db/db mice,

it increases body weight evidenced by clearly increased
insulin sensitivity, healthier blood lipid profile, and less
lipid accumulation in liver despite highly increased body
weight in adiponectin-overexpressed ob/ob mice [27].
Thus, the net effect of MHY2013 may be the amelioration
of metabolic profile without decreasing body weight.
In conclusion, the balanced activation of the three
PPAR subtypes by MHY2013 improved obesity-induced
insulin resistance, hepatic steatosis, and dyslipidemia
without weight gain and severe toxicity. Although all
the metabolic signaling pathways and target tissues are
not examined in the current study, we assume that the
elevation of beneficial hormones including FGF21 and
adiponectin, WAT browning signaling, and fatty acid
oxidation signaling in liver and skeletal muscle may
synergistically contribute to the beneficial effects of
MHY2013.
Our present study supports the concept of a pan
PPAR therapeutic approach to conditions which comprise
the metabolic syndrome. Further studies are needed
to enable MHY2013 clinical use for targeting various
metabolic diseases.

We used the AutoDock 4.2 program and the tool’s manual
because of its automated docking capabilities. To define
the docking pockets of the three PPAR subtypes, we used
a set of predefined active sites of human PPARs. Docking
simulations were performed between the three PPAR
subtypes and MHY2013. To prepare compounds for the
docking simulation, we performed the following steps:
[1] 2D structures were converted into 3D structures, [2]
charges were calculated, and [3] hydrogen atoms were
added using the ChemOffice program (http://www.
cambridgesoft.com). In addition, the LigandScout 3.0
program was used to generate a pharmacophore model and
to predict possible hydrogen-bonding residues between
the three PPAR subtypes and MHY2013. AMBER ff99SB
force-field parameter was applied for calculating ligand
molecules. The docking protocol was validated by docking
co-crystallized ligand structure. Energy evaluations were
2500000 and population size was 150.

Cell culture system and adipocytes
differentiation
YPEN-1, a rat prostate endothelial cell line, and
HepG2, a human liver cancer cell line, were purchased
from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas,
VA, USA). 3T3-L1, a murine pre-adipocyte cell line, was
obtained from Dr. Hyeung-Rak Kim (Pukyoung National
University, Pusan, Korea). Cells were maintained in
Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium containing 5%
(YPEN-1) or 10% (HepG2 and 3T3-L1) fetal bovine
serum (Gibco, Grand Island, NY, USA), 100 U/mL
penicillin, and 100 μg/mL streptomycin (all from Hyclone,
Inc., Logan, UT, USA) at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere.
For adipocytes differentiation, cells were cultured to
confluence (day 0) and then exposed to the differentiation
mixture (0.5 mm 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine, 1 μM
dexamethasone, and 10 μg/mL insulin). After 48 h of
incubation, the cells were maintained in a medium
containing 10 μg/mL insulin until harvest on day 7.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Animal experiments
Male, 8-week-old C57BLKS/J-lean (db/m) and
C57BLKS/J-db/db mice were purchased from Japan SLC
and acclimated to the animal care facility for seven days
before the experiments. Animals were housed in an airconditioned atmosphere under a 12 h light/dark cycle
and were given free access to a standard rodent chow
(Samtako) and water. The animal study was approved
by the Institutional Animal Care Committee of Pusan
National University (2, Busandaehak-ro 63beon-gil,
Geumjeong-gu, Busan, Republic of Korea) and performed
in accordance with the guidelines for animal experiments
issued by Pusan National University. Vehicle and
MHY2013 (5 mg/kg/day) were injected by oral gavage
for three weeks. The mice were monitored daily for food
intake and once in three days for body weight. After two
weeks, a glucose tolerance test (GTT) was performed by
intraperitoneal injection of 1.5 g/kg glucose after overnight
fasting. Blood was taken from the tail at indicated time
points, and the glucose concentration was determined
with a glucometer (Accu-Chek, Roche Diagnostics). The
animals were euthanized after three weeks, and serum and
tissues were collected.

Primary adipocytes culture
Subcutaneous fat pads from 8-week-old mice
were excised, minced and digested in HEPES buffer
with type1 collagenase at 37 °C for 90 min. The cells
were diluted in 1% FBS-DMEM buffer. Diluted cell
suspension was filtered with 70 μm nylon mesh to
remove undigested tissues and then centrifuged at 500
g for 15 min to sediment clumps. The supernatant was
removed and red blood cell (RBC) lysis buffer was
added and gently suspended. After 5 min incubation at
room temperature, equal volume of 10% FBS-DMEM
was added and then filtered with 40 μm nylon mesh to
remove endothelial cell clumps. Filtered cell suspension
was centrifuged at 500 g for 5min and all but 2-3ml of
the supernatant was removed. The pellet was suspended

In Silico protein–ligand docking simulation
The crystal structures of human PPARα, PPARβ/δ,
and PPARγ were obtained from the Protein Data Bank
(PDB ID: PPARα, 1K7L; PPARβ/δ, 1GWX; and PPARγ,
3DZY) and used as the targets in docking calculations.

primary antibodies (all from Santa Cruz Biotechnology,
Santa Cruz, CA, USA), diluted in ABS-TS (1:1,000), at
4 °C overnight. The cells were washed three times with
ABS-TS, then incubated with a secondary anti-rabbit IgG
antibody labeled with Alexa Fluor-488 (Invitrogen) for 30
min, and washed with ABS. Cell nuclei were visualized
by immunostaining with Hoechst 33342 (Invitrogen), and
immunostained images of the three PPAR subtypes were
acquired by confocal laser scanning microscopy (TCS
SP2, Leica, Wetzler, Germany).

Cell viability assay
The cell viability assay was carried out
using 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium
bromide (MTT; DoGen, Korea). YPEN-1 cells (1 × 104)
were plated in each well of a 96-well cell culture plate and
allowed to attach overnight. After the cells were exposed
to MHY2013 at concentrations ranging from 1 to 10 μM
for 24 h, the MTT reagent was added to each well, and the
plate was incubated for 1 h. Absorbance in each well was
determined at 560 nm using a microplate reader

Protein extraction and immunoblot analysis
For extraction of cytosol and nuclear fractions from
cells and tissues, a cell pellet or tissue was suspended and
homogenized in 10 mM Tris, pH 8.0, with 1.5 mM MgCl2,
1 mM dithiothreitol, 0.1% NP-40, and protease inhibitors,
incubated on ice for 15 min, and then centrifuged at 12,000
rpm at 4 °C for 10 min. The supernatants were used as the
cytosolic fractions. The pellets were washed three times
and re-suspended in 10 mM Tris, pH 8.0, with 50 mM
KCl, 100 mM NaCl, and protease inhibitors, incubated on
ice for 30 min, and then centrifuged at 12,000 rpm at 4 °C
for 10 min. The resultant supernatants were used as the
nuclear fractions. The protein concentration was measured
using the BCA assay (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA,
USA). Samples were prepared in a gel buffer (12.5 mM
Tris, 4% sodium dodecyl sulfate, 20% glycerol, 10%
2-mercaptoethanol, and 0.2% bromophenol blue, pH 6.8)
and boiled for 5 min. Western blot assays were performed
as previously described, with minor modifications [28].
Primary antibodies raised against PPARα, PPARβ/δ,
PPARγ, AMPKα1/2, phospho-AMPKα1/2 (Thr172),
phospho-LKB1 (Ser431), transcription factor II B (TFIIB),
and β-Actin (all from Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were
used.

Luciferase assay
For a peroxisome proliferator response element
(PPRE)-driven luciferase assay, 5 × 104 YPEN-1 cells
were seeded per well into a 48-well cell culture plate. The
PPRE-X3-TK-LUC plasmid (0.5 μg) (a kind gift from
Dr. Christoper K. Glass, University of California, San
Diego, CA, USA) and 0.05 μg of the PPARα, PPARβ/δ,
and PPARγ expression vectors (kind gifts from Dr. Han
Geuk Seo, Konkuk University, Seoul, South Korea) were
transfected into the cells using 1 μL of the Lipofectamine
2000 reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) according
to the manufacturer’s instructions. For the FGF21–
luciferase assay, 2 × 104 HepG2 cells were seeded per
well into a 96-well cell culture plate. The FGF21–LUC
plasmid (0.1 μg) (a kind gift from Dr. Kook Hwan Kim,
Yonsei University, Seoul, South Korea) was transfected
into the cells using 0.1 μL of the Lipofectamine 3000
reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. After the incubation for 24 h, the cells were
treated with the vehicle[dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)], 10
μM MHY2013, WY14643 (a known PPARα agonist),
rosiglitazone (a known PPARγ agonist), and GW501516
(a known PPARβ/δ agonist) for 5 h. Luciferase activity
was measured using the One-Glo Luciferase Assay
System (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) and a luminometer
(Berthold Technologies GmbH & Co., Bad Wildbad,
Germany).

Isolation of RNA and quantitative real-time
polymerase chain reaction
Tissue and cell RNA was purified using the TRIzol
reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s
instruction. Total RNA (2.0 μg) treated with RNase-free
DNase was reverse-transcribed with a cDNA synthesis
kit from GenDEPOT (Barker, TX, USA). Quantitative
polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) was performed using
the THUNDERBIRD SYBR qPCR mix (TOYOBO Co.,
Osaka, Japan) and a CFX Connect System (Bio-Rad
Laboratories, Inc., Hercules, CA, USA). The primer
sequences are shown in Supplementary Table 2.

Immunocytochemistry
YEPN-1 cells (2 × 105) were seeded in a 35-mm
cover-glass-bottom dish and allowed to attach overnight.
The cells were treated with 10 μM MHY2013, WY14643,
rosiglitazone, and GW501516 for 1.5 h and washed
twice with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Then, the
cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 30 min
at room temperature and washed using PBS with 0.5%
Triton X-100. After washing, the cells were blocked in
ABS/0.1% Triton X-100/3% goat serum (ABS-TS) for
30 min. Subsequently, the cells were immunostained
with rabbit anti-PPARα, anti-PPARβ/δ, and anti-PPARγ
