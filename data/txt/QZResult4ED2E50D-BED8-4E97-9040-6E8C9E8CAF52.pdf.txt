Abstract
With the goal to remove the roots of cancer, eliminate
metastatic seeds, and overcome therapy resistance, the 2014
inaugural International Cancer Stem Cell (CSC) Conference at
Cleveland, OH, convened together over 320 investigators,
including 55 invited world-class speakers, 25 short oral
presenters, and 100 poster presenters, to gain an in-depth
understanding of CSCs and explore therapeutic opportunities
targeting CSCs. The meeting enabled intriguing discussions on

several topics including: genetics and epigenetics; cancer origin
and evolution; microenvironment and exosomes; metabolism
and inﬂammation; metastasis and therapy resistance; single cell
and heterogeneity; plasticity and reprogramming; as well as
other new concepts. Reports of clinical trials targeting
CSCs emphasized the urgent need for strategically designing
combinational CSC-targeting therapies against cancer. Cancer

Cancer Stem Cell Overview

At the opening session, Dr. Jeremy Rich (Cleveland Clinic,
Cleveland, OH) introduced the concept of tumor heterogeneity
and presented the evolution of the CSC model as being driven by
key regulatory factors such as genetic diversity, epigenetics, and
pathways, and tumor microenvironment (8). He explained the
required functional characteristics of CSCs—self-renewal, proliferation, and tumor initiation/propagation, as well as the common, but not deﬁning, characteristics of CSCs such as rarity, stem
cell markers, and differentiation. In this meeting, scientists
explored CSCs in many tumor types including brain tumors,
epithelial cancers, and leukemia.
As a keynote speaker, Dr. Irving Weissman (Stanford University, Stanford, CA) emphasized that the exclusive characteristic of
stem cells and CSCs is self-renewal (9). His group reported
preleukemic mutations in the otherwise normal hematopoietic
stem cells (10), and identiﬁed CD47 as an important CSC marker
of immune evasion from macrophage-mediated phagocytosis
(11) as well as a therapeutic target in human primary acute
myeloid leukemia (AML) and breast cancer cell xenografts. Dr.
Michael Clarke (Stanford University, Stanford, CA), also a keynote speaker, presented his work on the genetic regulations of
stem cells and cancer stem cells. He showed that regulation can be
determined by two properties, sufﬁcient self-renewal promoters
such as Bmi1, and lack of drivers of differentiation, apoptosis, and
senescence. He demonstrated that USP16 inhibits self-renewal
with Cdkn2a activation, thereby causing a stem cell defect in
neural stem cell (NSC) as well as mammary epithelial stem cells in
Down syndrome (12).

As early as 1937, Furth and Kahn successfully transplanted
leukemia with a single mouse leukemic cell (1), showing the ﬁrst
evidence of stem cell-like cancer cells, now termed cancer stem
cells (CSC) or tumor-initiating cells (TIC). Dr. John Dick's group
transplanted and identiﬁed human leukemic stem cells (LSC) in
the 1990s (2, 3). The continued cornerstones of identifying CSCs
in human solid tumors, breast (4) and brain (5), led to the
emerging ﬁeld of cancer stem cell research with new prospects
to understand and the hope of eliminating cancer (6, 7).

Cancer Stem Cells: Targeting the Roots of Cancer

to explore the cell of origins. Dr. Luis Parada (University of Texas
Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, TX) reported on his work
that focuses on the early genetic events and cell of origin of mouse
gliomas, and demonstrated that a subset of endogenous quiescent
glioma stem cells (GSC) was able to propagate the tumor after
chemotherapy by lineage tracing (13). Dr. Michael M. Shen
(Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY) showed
that luminal cells are favored as the cell of origin for mouse
prostate cancer by lineage tracing (14). Dr. Helen Salz (Case
Western Reserve University, Cleveland, OH) presented her work
describing the tumor-suppressing role of the female-speciﬁc RNAbinding protein SXL and the oncogenic role of testis-speciﬁc
chromatin reader Phf7 in Drosophila ovary stem cells (15). Dr.
Zhenghe John Wang (Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland,
OH) reported that the loss of the tumor suppressor tyrosine
phosphatase PTPRT in intestinal stem cells makes these cells more
proliferative through activating STAT3 (pY705; ref. 16). In glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), Dr. Antonio Iavarone (Columbia
University, New York, NY) identiﬁed novel oncogenic tyrosine
kinase fusion proteins (FGFR-TACC3) as genetic drivers and
targets of CSCs (17), in addition to the epigenetic regulation by
transcriptional factors such as STAT3 and C/EBPb. In short talks,
Dr. Jennifer Yu (Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH) showed the
semaphorin family member SEMA3C as a GSC-speciﬁc target, and
Dr. Craig Horbinski (University of Kentucky, Lexington, KY)
reported on the role of proapoptotic prostate apoptosis response
4 (PAR4) in GSCs (18).
Dr. Bradley Bernstein (Massachusetts General Hospital,
Boston, MA) discovered a core set of neurodevelopmental
transcription factors (POU3F2, SOX2, SALL2, and OLIG2)
essential for CSC reprogramming and GBM propagation
(19), and presented the intratumoral heterogeneity of primary
GBM by single cell RNA-seq with one tumor showing an
immune cell expression signature (20). Dr. Catriona Jamieson
(University of California, Moores Cancer Center, San Diego)
presented that in replating and in humanized mouse model
assays, RNA recoding by adenosine deaminases acting on
dsRNA (ADAR1) is essential for blast crisis chronic myeloid
leukemia stem cells to be maintained (21).
Dr. Michael Taylor (University of Toronto, Toronto, ON)
discussed the CpG island methylator phenotype (CIMP) in the
posterior fossa (PF) ependymoma, the only recurrent cancer with
no known recurrent mutations but with silenced genes controlled
by the polycomb-related complex 2 (22). Dr. Jeongwu Lee (Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH) reported that noncanonical signaling
by EZH2 in regulating methylation of STAT3 was required for
glioblastoma stem cell maintenance (23). Dr. Elizaveta Benevolenskaya (University of Illinois at Chicago, Chicago, IL) demonstrated that the targets of H3K4 demethylase KDM5A were signiﬁcantly elevated and the targets of H3K27 methyltransferase
EZH2 were signiﬁcantly decreased in the basal subtype of breast
cancer. These results suggest that targeting the aberrant epigenetic
landscape of aggressive tumors may be an effective treatment
strategy.

Microenvironment, Metabolism,
Inﬂammation, and New Concepts
Dr. Jeremy Rich suggested that CSCs are products of their
environments in which conventional therapies (chemotherapy
and radiotherapy) stimulate cancer-associated ﬁbroblasts (24) to

www.aacrjournals.org

secrete cytokines (TGFb, IL6, IL17A) and promote stemness of
brain CSCs. Dr. Arnold Caplan (Case Western Reserve University,
Cleveland, OH) presented his work demonstrating that mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) originate in situ as perivascular cells
called pericytes (25). The pericyte serves as gate-keepers for
metastasizing tumor cells like those from melanoma. The CD146
antigen on both the pericyte and the melanoma plays a crucial role
in bringing the MSCs into the developing tumor to assist in tumor
expansion (26). Dr. Justin Lathia (Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland,
OH) discussed that the interaction of CSCs with immune cells
results in immune suppression and tumor progression in GBM.
Dr. Jan L€
otvall (University of Gothenburg, Gothenburg,
Sweden) reported on an emerging mechanism of microenvironmental cross-talk conducted via exosomes (40–100 nm in
diameter), which are secreted by various cell types and play roles
in epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), tumor hypoxia,
cancer invasiveness, metastasis, angiogenesis, and tolerance to
chemotherapy (27).
Metabolites and inﬂammatory cells/cytokines are part of the
environmental regulation of CSCs. Featured speaker Dr. Celeste
Simon (University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA) reported
that depletion of fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase promotes clear cell
renal cell carcinoma growth, regulates carbon metabolism, and
inhibits hypoxia-inducible factors (HIF1a, HIF2a; ref. 28), in
accordance with miR-218 to inhibit HIF2a in GBM (29). Dr. Rolf
Bjerkvig (University of Bergen, Bergen, Norway) presented an
innovative GBM model system of biopsy spheroids, which can be
implanted in a nude rat brain, and reported on the cellular
plasticity of the CD133þ/ cells as well as the metabolomics
adaptability of the GBM in response to anti-VEGF treatment
(30, 31).
Dr. Ofer Reizes (Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH) demonstrated that leptin and leptin receptor, a JAK/STAT cytokine receptor
expressed in breast CSCs (BCSC), is necessary for maintaining the
NANOGþ BCSC phenotype (32). Dr. Emina Huang (Cleveland
Clinic, Cleveland, OH) showed that elevated IL8 levels secreted
from stromal ﬁbroblasts cause a substantial increase in tumorigenicity induced by aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH)-1þ colon
cancer-initiating cells within colitis-associated cancer (33).
Dr. Yue Xiong (University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, NC)
reported two regulatory mechanisms of the Tet DNA dioxygenases, by metabolites and by ubiquitylation. These mechanisms
eventually inﬂuence DNA methylation and epigenetic modiﬁcations of embryonic stem cells and CSCs (34). Dr. Alex Huang
(Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, OH) established
intravital 2-photon microscopy to directly observe how immune
cells trafﬁc and interact with various cells in the tumor microenvironment in real time with single-cell resolution (35). In a short
talk, David Schonberg's (Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH) work
suggested that glioblastoma stem cells require increased ferritin,
and that targeting ferritin inhibits GSC tumorigenicity in vitro and
in vivo. Dr. Masahiro Hitomi (Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH)
described a critical role for cell–cell communication in GBM CSCs
and suggested a novel therapeutic option for treating GBM. Kelli
Pointer (University of Wisconsin, Madison, WI) brieﬂy discussed
the role of collagen in GBM tumor invasion and patient survival.

Epithelial Tumor Stem Cells and Metastasis
Epithelial tumors are the most frequent tumor types (breast
and prostate) as well as the leading cause of cancer deaths

(lung, colon, and breast), of which metastasis accounts for
90%. Dr. Carla Kim (Boston Children's Hospital and Harvard
Medical School, Boston, MA) identiﬁed Sca-1þ lung tumorpropagating cells in the murine genetic models. Her work
demonstrated that BDNF-TrkB promotes lung adenocarcinoma
metastasis and that the BMP4 signaling drives differentiation
(36, 37). Dr. Catherine O'Brien (University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada) reported that human colorectal cancerinitiating cell (CIC) functions are dependent on the canonical
self-renewal regulator, BMI-1, by regulating b-catenin and TOP/
LEF activity (38).
Dr. Jeffrey Rosen (Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX)
described that Wnt signaling and Ror2 depletion regulated both
normal mammary stem cells and BCSCs, and that there was a
cooperative interplay between CSCs and non-CSCs in mouse
breast tumor models. Dr. Ruth Keri (Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, OH) discussed the distinct transcriptional
controls of breast cancer epithelial cell states by FOXA1 and
FOXC1 as well as their signaling pathways related to BET and
MMP7 (39, 40).
Dr. John Condeelis (Albert Einstein College of Medicine,
Bronx, NY) introduced multiphoton imaging technology to
examine invasion and intravasation of tumor cells, demonstrating
that macrophages enhance breast tumor cell migration and intravasation upon physical contact (41, 42). Dr. Huiping Liu (Case
Western Reserve University, Cleveland, OH) reported a surprising
differentiation and nonmalignancy phenotype of lung metastasis
compared with primary tumors with upregulated miR-30c and
miR-138 that target TWF1/VIM/IL-11 and EZH2 (43, 44). Dr.
Ruggero De Maria (Regina Elena National Cancer Institute, Rome,
Italy) reported on the CSC targeting strategies he has developed,
including locked nucleic acid to inhibit oncomiRs (miR-197;
ref. 45), new therapeutic antibodies against GBM CSCs, and
strategies to prevent colon cancer metastasis by targeting
CD44v6þ cells (46). Dr. Yibin Kang (Princeton University, Princeton, NJ) characterized the interactions between the metadherin
and Staphylococcal nuclease domain-containing 1 (SND1) in
tumor initiation and metastasis of breast and prostate cancers
(47).
In short talks, Dr. Xiling Shen (Cornell University, Ithaca,
NY) demonstrated that miR-34a regulates Notch1, symmetric
divisions, and differentiation of colon colorectal CSCs (48).
Dr. Min Yu (University of Southern California, Los Angeles,
CA) reported on the genomic mutations in ESR1 and other
proliferative signaling genes of captured circulating tumor cells
from patients with breast cancer. Dr. Yu showed novel drug
sensitivities in these mutant cell lines (49). Dr. Sunitha
Nagrath (University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI) presented
the results of her analysis on circulating tumor cells and CSCs
using microﬂuidic chips. Benjamin Bryson (Case Western
Reserve University, Cleveland, OH) showed that OncostatinM (OSM) drives EMT and breast CSC phenotypes in a MYCdependent manner. Mary Doherty (Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, OH) discussed a potential inhibitory role of
IFNb in breast CSC transition and Ilana Chefetz Menaker
(University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI) reported ALDH inhibition-induced death of ovarian CSCs. Dr. Diana Azzam (University of Miami, Coral Gables, FL) identiﬁed distinct subsets
of CSCs within triple-negative breast cancers with varying
metastatic potential and differential response to epigenetic
targeting agents.

Evolution, Heterogeneity, and Therapeutic
Resistance
Dr. Stanton Gerson (Case Western Reserve University,
Cleveland, OH) proposed a preleukemic stem cell (pre-LSC)
model in MSH2/ mice in which MSH2/ pre-LSCs are able
to initiate normal hematopoiesis and develop transplantable
lymphomagenesis within 5 to 7 months. Using high-content
single cell analysis with single cell genomics, Dr. Peter Kuhn
(University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA) presented
the mathematical modeling for a spatiotemporal understanding
of cancer progression, as well as an experimental mapping of
disease response in patients (50). Dr. Dean Tang (University of
Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX) demonstrated
that a population of phenotypically undifferentiated prostate
cancer cells (low or negative for prostate-speciﬁc antigen and
androgen receptor) is highly resistant to castration and other
clinical therapies, and may also represent a cell-of-origin for
castration-resistant prostate cancer (51).
Using the lineage mapping of NSC clones in glioblastoma-prone
mouse brains in their premalignant state, Dr. Evan Snyder's
(Sanford-Burnham Medical Research Institute, and University of
California-San Diego, La Jolla, CA) work suggested that many
different cells, under the right conditions, can give rise to a neoplasm, and that the "fate choice" of a given member of a stem cell
clone to become a normal brain constituent or a GBM cell may
pivot on a developmentally inappropriate neurogenic-to-gliogenic
switch compounded by cell nonautonomous factors (and not
solely on genetic predisposing factors). Subsequently, Dr. Claudia
Petritsch (University of California, San Francisco, CA) described the
presence of asymmetry-defective cells with oligodendrocyte progenitor cell characteristics in malignant astrocytomas modeled by
BRafV600E expression and Cdkn2a deletion (52). Dr. Tannishtha
Reya (University of California, San Diego, CA) suggested that
regulators of asymmetric division can be effective targets for tumor
resolution (53). Using ﬂuorescence-guided multiple sampling, Dr.
Colin Watts (University of Cambridge, Cambridge, England) demonstrated the clonal evolutionary dynamics of glioblastomas in
patients having multiple GBM subtypes (54, 55).
Dr. Ichiro Nakano (Ohio State University, Columbus, OH)
found that radiosensitive proneural glioma with differentiation
capacity is converted by radiation to mesenchymal glioma, which
is resistant to radiation with elevated ALDH (ALDH-1A3 in
particular) activity in GSCs and a worse prognosis (56). Dr. Jacob
Scott (H. Lee Mofﬁtt Cancer Center and Research Institute, Tampa,
FL) presented a mathematical model of rapid selective evolutionary dynamics in hypoxic GSC niches (57). With identiﬁcation of
four factors (CD15, Notch, CD90, and EGFR) that can distinguish
NSCs from neural progenitor cells (NPC), Dr. Siddhartha Mitra
(Stanford University, Stanford, CA) demonstrated that NPCs were
more likely to form gliomas than NSCs in vivo. And, in the ﬁnal talk
of this session, Dr. Yu Shi (Southwest Hospital of Third Military
Medical University, Chongqing, China) described the tumorsuppressing role of miR-663 in glioblastoma, which is downregulated along with increased glioma grade (58).

ligand-dependent tyrosine kinase tumor suppressor protein and a
ligand-independent promoter of GSCs in response to AKT activation (59). Dr. William Schiemann (Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, OH) introduced an EGFR-assisted TGFb-driven EMT model (NMuMG cells) and suggested that both EMT and
MET phenotypes contribute to metastasis. Dr. Jianjun Chen
(University of Chicago, Chicago, IL) reported a dual role of
miR-126 in the development and progression of AML (60) to
either promote or inhibit AML1-ETO/t(8;21)-mediated leukemogenesis with different gene signatures.
In a short talk, Dr. Geraldine J. Guasch (Cincinnati Children's
Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, OH) suggested that transition zones are associated with tumor formation in humans upon
loss of TGFb signaling. Jacob Smigiel (Case Western Reserve
University, Cleveland, OH) reported a role of GREM-1 as inhibiting EMT and the cytokine Oncostatin M-induced breast CSC
transition. However, GREM-1 may show different effects in brain
tumor cells as discussed by Drs. Lathia and Rich.

resistant to Herceptin. Her laboratory also showed that stem cells
in HER2 tumors are associated with resistance to Herceptin.
There were a few clinical trials suggesting that combination
therapies might be necessary to target both CSCs and non-CSCs.
Dr. Andrew Sloan (University Hospitals Case Medical Center &
Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, OH) presented data
from his randomized controlled phase II trial that vismodegib
alone had biologic activity targeting the sonic hedgehog-signaling
pathway, but was not sufﬁcient as a single agent to improve
survival in patients with recurrent GBM. On the basis of a phase
II clinical trial, Dr. Manmeet Ahluwalia (Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH) concluded that a potent selective inhibitor of g secretase, R04929097, by itself is inefﬁcient in inducing progressionfree survival in GBM. Dr. Ira Steinberg (Boston Biomedical, Cambridge, MA) summarized the promising antitumor effects of the
cancer stemness inhibitors, including BBI608 (inhibitor of Stat-3
and b-catenin pathways) in synergy with paclitaxel and BBI503
(inhibitor of stemness kinases).

Clinical Trials of CSC Targeting
Therapeutics

Conclusions

In addition to Dr. Irving Weissman's ongoing anti-CD47 trials,
this meeting witnessed the growth of emerging clinical trials that
target CSCs. Dr. David Wald (Case Western Reserve University,
Cleveland, OH) induced differentiation of AML stem cells by
using the GSK3 inhibitor lithium in synergy with all-trans-retinoic
acid (ATRA) now in a phase I clinical trial (61). Dr. Yogen
Saunthararajah (Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH) reported on
his exploration of a novel epigenetic regulation approach using a
DNMT1 inhibitor decitabine in a nontoxic dosing scheme to
induce differentiation with cytogenetic remissions in AML
patients, reporting 84% responded with stable disease (62),
without affecting normal hematopoietic stem cells (63). Dr.
Kenneth Nephew (Indiana University, Bloomington, IN) also
investigated the effects of a new DNMT inhibitor, SGI-110, in
eliminating ovarian cancer stem cells that are enriched in residual,
platinum-resistant tumors (64).
Dr. Austin Gurney (OncoMed Pharmaceuticals, Redwood City,
CA) targeted the stem cell pathways of Notch, Wnt, and RSPO in
cancer treatment using Demcizumab (anti-Notch ligand DLL4
antibody), OMP-52M51 (anti-Notch1), and OMP-18R5 (antiWnt receptor FZD monoclonal antibody) in combination with
chemotherapeutic agents on cancers of pancreas, lung, breast, and
colon (65). Dr. Sanford Markowitz (Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, OH) identiﬁed the TGFb-regulated metabolic
tumor suppressor 15-prostaglandin dehydrogenase (15-PGDH)
pathway in colon tumorigenesis and discussed its clinical translation. Dr. Lyndsay Harris (Case Western Reserve University,
Cleveland, OH) and her team discovered a basal-like group of
HER2 tumors with a stem cell-like, EMT phenotype that are more

The research presented in this conference demonstrated an
increasing contribution from the expanding CSC ﬁeld to a better
understanding of cancer biology, and showed a growing demanding of bench-to-bedside translations. In addition to scientiﬁc
sessions, a grant and career development workshop with six
panelists (Dr. Huiping Liu, Dr. Suresh Mohla of NIH/NCI,
Dr. Angela Ng of NIH/CSR, Dr. Ming Lei of NIH/NCI, Dr. Justin
Lathia, and Dr. Jill Barnholtz-Sloan of Case Western Reserve
University) was offered to inspire young generations. Dr. Stanton
Gerson suggested creating an International Society of Cancer Stem
Cells by the second CSC meeting in 2016.
