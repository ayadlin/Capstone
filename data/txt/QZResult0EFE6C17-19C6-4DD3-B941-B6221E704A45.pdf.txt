ABSTRACT
The long-term overall survival of Ewing sarcoma (EWS) patients remains poor; less
than 30% of patients with metastatic or recurrent disease survive despite aggressive
combinations of chemotherapy, radiation and surgery. To identify new therapeutic
options, we employed a multi-pronged approach using in silico predictions of drug
activity via an integrated bioinformatics approach in parallel with an in vitro screen
of FDA-approved drugs. Twenty-seven drugs and forty-six drugs were identified,
respectively, to have anti-proliferative effects for EWS, including several classes of
drugs in both screening approaches. Among these drugs, 30 were extensively validated
as mono-therapeutic agents and 9 in 14 various combinations in vitro. Two drugs,
auranofin, a thioredoxin reductase inhibitor, and ganetespib, an HSP90 inhibitor, were
predicted to have anti-cancer activities in silico and were confirmed active across
a panel of genetically diverse EWS cells. When given in combination, the survival
rate in vivo was superior compared to auranofin or ganetespib alone. Importantly,
extensive formulations, dose tolerance, and pharmacokinetics studies demonstrated
that auranofin requires alternative delivery routes to achieve therapeutically effective
levels of the gold compound. These combined screening approaches provide a rapid
means to identify new treatment options for patients with a rare and often-fatal
disease.

INTRODUCTION

in Caucasians. The American Cancer Society estimates
that 225 children and adolescents are diagnosed with
EWS in North America each year. The most significant
prognostic factor for patients with EWS is the presence or
absence of overt metastatic disease. Metastatic disease is
most commonly located in the lungs (30%), bone and/or
bone marrow (30%), and lung metastasis combined with
bone and/or bone marrow metastasis (20%) [4]. Other
clinical prognostic factors have been found, such as tumor

Ewing sarcoma (EWS) is a rare, aggressive
malignancy of neuroectodermal origin that develops
in bones and, less often, in soft tissues [1]. EWS is the
second most common bone malignancy after osteosarcoma
[2], and it frequently develops in pediatric and young
adult age groups [3]. The incidence of EWS is about
3/1,000,000 cases per year, with a clear predominance

location, tumor size, patient age, and pattern of metastasis
[5]. About 25% of patients show distant metastasis at the
time of diagnosis [6]. More than 90% of the EWS tumors
harbor an (11;22) (q24;q12) translocation that encodes
for a EWS/FLI1 fusion protein [7], which functions as a
potent oncoprotein with an abnormal transcription factor
behavior that leads to aberrant expression of numerous
genes and contributes to tumorigenicity [8, 9].
The current therapies for patients with metastatic
EWS are limiting. The introduction of the multimodal
approach in the management of EWS resulted in a
significant increase in survival for EWS patients. Adding
chemotherapy to the combination of surgery and radiation
is essential in treating EWS due to the presence of
residual tumor after resection and micro-metastasis even
in localized disease [10]. The front-line chemotherapy
for EWS is alternating vincristine/doxorubicin/
cyclophosphamide (VDC) and ifosfamide/etoposide (IE)
[11]. Patients with localized tumors currently have a 75%
survival rate compared to 10% before the introduction
of chemotherapy. Unfortunately, patients with metastatic
disease (about 25% of patients at the time of diagnosis)
still do poorly with a 20% 5-year-survival rate [7, 10, 12].
A high percentage of patients develop metastasis and
resistance to the current treatment regimens [10], which
warrants further exploration of possible therapeutic
targets.

approach. In total, 43 distinct drugs were predicted using
the three computational approaches. Twenty-seven of these
drugs were then manually selected for extensive in vitro
validation (Figure 1).

In vitro screening

RESULTS

We screened, in parallel to the three computational
approaches, an FDA-approved drug library containing
2,316 drugs (1,536 unique chemical entities). A panel of
sarcoma cell lines including 3 EWS lines, each with a
confirmed EWS gene rearrangements [15] and two nontumorigenic and one benign osteoid osteoma control cell
lines (Hs 822.T., Hs 863.T., and Hs 919.T.), respectively
were used (Tables 1 and 2). Hs 882.T. and Hs 863.T. were
previously reported to be of Ewing sarcoma origin [16];
however, FISH analysis and molecular characterization by
our group failed to identify an EWS gene rearrangement
(unpublished data). The drug screening study protocol
employed is summarized in Supplementary Table S1. In
total, 78 drugs showed activity in at least one or more
EWS cell lines; however, 29 of the compounds were
cytotoxic to the non-tumorigenic control cells while
3 drugs (vincristine, doxorubicin and etoposide) are
currently prescribed for the treatment of EWS and were
eliminated from further consideration. Overall, forty-five
(45) drugs were identified in the primary screen, including
auranofin (Ridaura®) (Table 2) and were nominated for
further validation.

In silico prediction

Post screen analysis and secondary screen

The systems approach to repurposing drugs has
recently gained momentum in pursuit of new treatments
for various diseases [13, 14]. The basic concept is to use
integrated bioinformatics to identify drugs that can reverse
the gene expression of a given disease. We extended the
concept and proposed three computational approaches to
predict drugs for EWS from a drug library consisting of
1,335 drugs (Figure 1). First, the top 20 negatively scored
drug hits that are predicted to reverse the EWS disease
gene expression were selected (including 13 distinct
drugs). Second, the top 20 positively scored drug hits
(including 18 distinct drugs) that share a gene expression
profile similar to the pattern obtained by the silencing
of EWS/FLI1 via RNAi approaches (siEWS/FLI1) were
identified. Third, the top 20 drug hits (including 14
distinct drugs) that are predicted to reverse the derived
drug resistance expression signature were selected.
Some drug hits were repeated within each approach
or shared among multiple approaches. For example,
the HSP90 inhibitors, geldanamycin and tanespimycin
(17-(allylamino)-17-demethoxygeldanamycin, 17-AAG),
appeared 2 and 4 times, respectively, in the list of the
resistance-based approach. MS-275, an HDAC inhibitor,
appeared in both disease-based and siRNA-based

Next, the predicted and library screened drugs were
extensively validated. The in vitro activities of each drug
hit were evaluated in an expanded panel of EWS cell lines
(either the EWS/FLI1 or the EWS/ERG fusion) (Table 1)
and confirmed employing 12-point dose-response curves
ranging from 50 µmol/L to 1 nmol/L, with triplicate
sampling (Table 3). As mentioned above, one of the most
notable drug hits discovered through both the in silico and
in vitro drug screening approaches was auranofin. Based
on this finding, we subsequently screened auranofin against
six other marketed or investigational anticancer drug hits
(carfilzomib, elesclomol, bortezomib, geldanamycin,
AUY922, and ganetespib, Supplementary Figures S1–S5
and Figure 2). These drugs were chosen based on their
known mechanisms and safety profiles. We also tested
the synergy between these drug hits (Supplementary
Figures S6–S11). Several classes of agents were found to be
highly synergistic in combination with auranofin, including
the next generation HSP90 inhibitors ganetespib (STA9090; Synta Pharmaceuticals) and AUY922 (Novartis).
These independent results peaked our interest since
geldanamycin and its derivative 17-AAG were repeatedly
identified in our integrated bioinformatics studies.
Since the development of geldanamycin and 17-AAG

was discontinued due to clinical safety issues observed in
clinical trials [17], we sought to investigate a lead HSP90
inhibitor, ganetespib (Synta Pharmaceuticals), which has a
better risk-benefit profile in clinical trials. We evaluated the
anti-proliferation effect in combination treatments using
the EWS and control cell lines. As shown in Figure 2,
the combined treatment of auranofin and ganetespib
inhibited cell growth and was highly synergistic across
all of the EWS lines as opposed to the non-tumorigenic
cell lines (red shows strong in vitro activity while green
lack thereof). The above-mentioned screening results were
deemed sufficient to warrant in vivo preclinical proof of
principle studies.

Because auranofin is predicted to mimic the silencing
of EWS-FLI1 oncogene in the in silico analysis and it
shows preferential toxicity against Ewing cells harboring
the EWS-FLI1 chimeric gene as compared with the nontumorigenic cells without the EWS-FLI1 gene (Figure 1),
we then investigated whether Ewing cells are sensitive to
auranofin if EWS-FLI1 is silenced. To knock down the
expression of EWS-FLI1 in A673 Ewing cells, we designed
two different siRNAs, corresponding to the sequence within
the 3ʹ downstream half of EWS-FLI1 mRNA (siFLI1-#3)

Figure 1: In silico prediction of drugs for EWS using three approaches. (A) Identify drugs that are likely to reverse disease

gene expression (disease-based approach). A disease gene expression signature was created from the results of two meta-analysis studies
[75, 76], where disease tissue samples and normal tissue samples were compared. (B) Identify drugs that mediate gene expression
similar to siRNA EWS/FLI1 (siEWS/FLI1) (siRNA-based approach). The siEWS/FLI signature was taken from the previous study [77].
(C) Identify drugs that are likely to sensitize drug resistance expression (resistance-based approach). A drug resistance expression signature
was computed by comparing the pre-treatment samples of patients who responded to chemotherapy versus those who did not respond to
chemotherapy [78]. Drug gene expression databases were built from the CMap 2.0 and part of the LINCS. In the plot, each dot represents
the score of one drug instance. One drug may have multiple instances due to multiple experiments. False discovery rate (FDR) value < 0.05
was used to select drug hits and only the top 20 drug hits for each approach were selected. In the heat map, the first column represents
the disease gene expression ranked by fold change and the remaining columns represent the gene expression of drug hits. Red shows upregulated genes and green shows down-regulated genes. All the drug hits from the three approaches were merged and manually evaluated.
The drugs colored by black were selected for further experimental validation.

and the sequence of the breakpoint of EWS-FLI1 type I
mRNA (siBPEF1) respectively. To examine whether the
siRNAs could abolish the expression of EWS-FLI1, the
effects of siRNAs on the protein levels of EWS-FLI1 were
analyzed by western blot (see Supplementary methods).
Treatment with siFLI1-#3, or to a greater extent, siBPEF1,
significantly decreased the EWS-FLI1 protein expression
in A673 cells with type I fusion at 48h after transfection,
as compared with the siControl treatment (Figure 3A). In
addition, A673 cells became resistant to auranofin after
the silencing of EWS-FLI1 gene, as evidenced by the
significant increase in the IC50 values of A673 cells treated
by siFLI1-#3 or siBPEF1 followed by the incubation of
auranofin for 72 h (siFLI1-#3 and siBPEF1 IC50 values
are above 1.0 µmol/L), as compared with the counterpart of
the siControl group (siControl, IC50 = 0.27 ± 0.02 µmol/L)
(Figure 3B). These experiments further validate the in
silico prediction and suggest a need to further assess its
potential clinical utility as an anti-cancer agent.

auranofin suspensions prepared in 0.5% hydroxypropyl
methyl cellulose to help assure dose uniformity. We
compared the ground contents of Ridaura® capsules,
the ground pure auranofin drug substance, auranofin
suspension containing 0.5% sodium lauryl sulfate (a
surfactant), auranofin suspensions with the pH adjusted to
pH = 1, 4 and 7, auranofin suspension dosed into fasted
versus high fat diet mice and finally a solution of auranofin
prepared in 5% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) with a pH = 1.
Pharmacokinetic studies were conducted on all of these
formulation variations. Blood samples from 3 mice at each
time point (0, 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, 24, 48 and 96 hours) and the
whole blood was assayed by ICPMS for gold.
We additionally studied dose accumulation of the
gold by comparing a formulation of Ridaura® capsule
contents as described above and dosing at 10 mg/Kg single
dose versus dosing the mice once daily for 5 days. The PK
study compared the gold content in whole blood samples as
described above for the single dose versus the gold content
in whole blood samples from the multidose arm with whole
blood collected at the end of each 24 hour dosing period
before the next dose (24, 48, 72, 96 and 120 hours) and
then whole blood collected every 24 hours for 5 additional
days (144, 168, 192, 216 and 240 hours) and assayed for
gold content. The results of these formulation and PK
studies are shown in Supplementary Table S2.
The formulation studies demonstrated that we were
unable to alter the amount of auranofin (gold) absorbed
through formulation variations. These findings led us to
develop and assess injectable (i.v. and i.p.) formulations
of auranofin. By defining maximum tolerated dose
(MTD) following i.v. and i.p. administration of solution
and suspension formulations of auranofin, our intent
was to evaluate auranofin alone and in combination with
ganetespib at MTD in mouse xenograft studies using the
more convenient i.p. route of administration. Following
administration of the solution formulation of auranofin
i.v. and i.p., the maximum tolerated dose was estimated
at 1 mg/kg and 6 mg/kg, respectively. Following a single

Defining maximum tolerated dose
Ridaura® (auranofin) is typically delivered
orally (capsules containing 3 mg auranofin) and has
been repurposed in several clinical trials with limited
results (i.e., clinicaltrials.gov identifier: NCT01419691,
NCT02126527, and NCT02126527). We hypothesized
that the oral bioavailability of auranofin (gold) might
explain the difference in its anti-cancer activities in vitro
versus in clinical trials given that the published product
monograph for Ridaura® capsules stated that the human
oral bioavailability of gold from Ridaura® capsules is
only approximately 25% [18, See Supplementary Material
Reference 18]. Additionally, the ability to increase the dose
of auranofin to achieve higher blood concentrations of gold
was limited by dose-limiting gastrointestinal side effects
(diarrhea, loose stools, nausea, vomiting and abdominal
cramps) [18, 19]. For our studies we dosed BALB/c
mice orally at 10 mg/Kg with different formulations of

i.p. suspension dose of auranofin, the maximum tolerated
dose was 16 mg/kg. This dose was reduced to 12 mg/kg
and dose tolerance was evaluated after 5 daily doses of
auranofin suspension i.p. to determine the effects of
the accumulation of gold in the blood due to the slow
elimination of gold. Based on the i.p. suspension dose
tolerance studies, the auranofin suspension formulation
and dose level of 12 mg/kg was selected for evaluation in
xenograft mouse studies.

the dose evaluated in EWS mouse xenograft studies. By
describing blood gold concentrations in vivo, we are able to
place the auranofin in vitro IC50 values described in Table 3,
as well as in vivo tumor response data in proper context.
As indicated previously, auranofin is a complex of
gold triethylphosphine and thioglucose tetraacetate. Gold
comprises 29% of auranofin by weight. Auranofin is
chemically and metabolically highly unstable in solution.
In our studies, auranofin immediately and completely
dissociates in plasma and whole blood ex vivo, as well
as simulated gastric fluid in vitro (unpublished results).
Following oral administration of 195Au auranofin to humans,
25% of administered 195Au appears in plasma [19]. Further,
approximately 40% of absorbed gold distributes into
erythrocytes with 60% found in plasma [19]. As a result,

and consistent with the extensive literature describing
auranofin pharmacokinetics in animals and humans,
we characterized the pharmacokinetics of i.p. auranofin
in mice by quantifying blood gold concentrations as
summarized in Table 4. Peak blood gold concentrations
were 12.43 μg/mL in mice receiving auranofin suspension
preceded by i.v. ganetespib. The apparent elimination
half-life of gold was 23.7 hours in mice pretreated with
ganetespib. The area under the blood gold concentrationtime profile, another measure of systemic exposure to gold,
was 535 hr*μg/mL in mice pretreated with ganetespib.
Following five consecutive once daily i.p. doses of 12 mg/kg
auranofin suspension in mice pretreated with ganetespib,
the trough (plateau) plasma gold concentration (24 hours
following the fifth daily dose) was 23.9 μg/mL.
The mean single dose Cmax value of 12.43 μg/mL,
expressed in molar concentration, equals to 63.10 μmol/L
(Table 4). The mean in vitro IC50 values for auranofin are
described in Table 3, for each of the EWS cell lines tested,
ranged from 0.08 to 5.38 μmol/L. IC50 values for gold in
these cell lines would be 29% of the values presented in
Table 3. We conclude that systemic drug exposure to gold
following 12 mg/kg ip auranofin suspension exceeded the
in vitro IC50 values for auranofin, and for gold, in each
of the EWS cell lines studied. In addition, blood gold
concentrations achieved in the studies described in this

work exceed systemic drug exposure observed in adult
and pediatric rheumatoid arthritis patients receiving
therapeutic, chronic doses of auranofin [19, 20].

Auranofin, ganetespib, and the combination
treatments improved survival of mice in a
xenograft mouse model
To assess the antitumor activity of auranofin
(using an alternative delivery approach), ganetespib
and the combination treatments in vivo, we generated a
xenograft nude mouse model by injecting A673 cells
intramuscularly proximal to the tibia. Based on the dose
tolerance and pharmacokinetic studies described above,
we administered auranofin at a tolerable daily i.p. dose
that achieved adequate systemic drug exposure. Auranofin
was administered with a dose of 12 mg/kg through an i.p.
injection once a day for 5 days per week, and ganetespib
was administered with a dose of 150 mg/kg through an
i.v. injection once weekly. Mice that grew palpable tumors
were randomized into four groups: vehicle, auranofin-only,
ganetespib-only, and the combination. The weights of the
mice were stable among all four arms throughout the
study, and no major side effects were observed except for
a skin lesion at the site of the i.v. injection at the base of
the tail of 2 mice in the ganetespib-only group. The H&E

staining of kidney, liver and spleen tissues showed no sign
of toxicity. The survival rates were significantly different
between the auranofin only, ganetespib only, and the
combination versus control groups (p < 0.05, confidence
interval 90%). The survival rate in the combination group
was nearly doubled in this extremely aggressive EWS
tumor animal model when compared to the control group
(Figure 3C).

“pipeline” for children and have hindered advancements
in the treatment of EWS. In 2003, Hirschfeld et al. stated
that the best opportunity for survival for patients with
EWS was to identify more effective therapies to apply to
newly diagnosed patients [21]. Sadly, more than ten years
later, this remains true and underscores the need for the
development of novel agents.
The Orphan Drug Act defines a rare disease as one
that affects less than 200,000 individuals in the United
States [22, 23]. Approximately 30 million people in the
United States are living with rare diseases, equating to one
in every ten Americans. Based on a recent study published
by DiMasi et al. for the Study of Drug Development,
costs to develop a new pharmaceutical agent is estimated
to $2870 million (2013 dollars) [24] The Orphan Drug
Act provides pharmaceutical companies with incentives
to develop and commercialize new treatments for
rare diseases. Despite these incentives; however, the
development time and costs make it difficult for firms
to invest in new therapies for diseases such as EWS.
Drug repurposing, exploring new uses for existing (FDA

DISCUSSION
Historically, drug development for pediatric cancers
has only occurred after agents have shown efficacy
in adult tumors. Clofarabine (approved for refractory
pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia) remains the
only anti-neoplastic agent ever approved for pediatric
use prior to adult labeling. Moreover, of the 120 new
cancer therapeutic agents approved for adults by the year
2003, only 30 have had a pediatric indication. Of these
30 drugs, only 15 acquired subsequent pediatric labeling.
These practices have led to limits in the new agents

approved) and abandoned drugs, represents an opportunity
to advance new treatments to rare disease patients more
quickly, and at a lower cost [25–27]. Over the past
few years, biotech, academia, government and disease
philanthropy organizations generated successful stories
using innovative technologies for drug repurposing [28].
The National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences
(NCATS) at the NIH also contributed tremendously to the
growth in this translational science area. The Learning
Collaborative, a partnership between the University
of Kansas Cancer Center (KUCC), the Leukemia and
Lymphomia Society (LLS) and the NIH’s Therapeutics
for Rare and Neglected Diseases (TRND) program, has
played a leadership role nationally in this effort [27].
We have leveraged our drug repurposing expertise and
experiences, along with an innovative in silico integrated
bioinformatics platform technology (e.g., [13, 29, 30]), to
not only identify drug repurposing opportunities in EWS,
but to advance these agents administered alone and in
combination with other anticancer agents through in vitro
and in vivo preclinical proof of principle studies.
A systematic approach using in silico prediction
combined with a traditional drug screening approach
identified numerous drug repurposing opportunities.
Molecular profiling data, critical to predicting drug
activity in silico, is growing rapidly with increasing
public access. Researchers are now able to combine
genome-wide proteomics, gene expression profiles, and
RNA interference data to build computational molecular
pathology systems. These molecular pathology models can
then be used to determine drug-disease connections using
general molecular characteristics [29]. This systematical
approach to repositioning drugs has now been applied
to many diseases. Examples include topiramate for
inflammatory bowel disease [30], trifluoperazine for lung
cancer [31], and rapamycin for lymphoid malignancies
[32]. By leveraging public datasets, we predicted 27 out of
1,335 drugs for in vitro validation. Fifteen out of 27 drugs
exhibit IC50 values of less than 10 µmol/L in one or more
EWS cell lines and 10 drugs exhibit IC50 values less
than 10 µmol/L in all six EWS cell lines tested. Notably,
6 drugs (auranofin, geldanamycin, vindesine, elesclomol,
daunorubicin, and MS-275) have IC50 values ten-fold
less in EWS cell lines than in the three non-tumorigenic
control cell lines. In addition to the high success rate of
discovering new drug hits, in silico prediction is relatively
inexpensive and quick, suggesting its great potential to
screen compounds.
In addition to the drugs that are predicted to reverse
the disease gene expression, we identified the drugs
that share an expression profile similar to the silence of
EWS/FLI1, a key causative factor in the pathogenesis
of EWS, and the drugs that may overcome clinical drug
resistance. Interestingly, the top 20 drug hits among the
three approaches have little overlap, although some drugs
may be significant in multiple approaches. For example,
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

geldanamycin, a drug predicted by the resistance-based
approach, is also significant in both disease-based
approach and siRNA-based approach, but it was ranked
out of 20. All three approaches led to positive hits, which
exhibit IC50 values less than 10 µmol/L in EWS cell lines
in vitro. These results suggested that in silico prediction
based on different sources is beneficial. Especially, the
recent efforts on molecular characterization of EWS
and cellular response to drug treatment provide new
opportunities to leverage diverse datasets for finding
therapeutics for EWS [33–35].
Our in vitro drug screen identified 46 hits of drugs.
These drugs were of diverse classes from alkylating
agents, steroids, estrogens, and enzyme inhibitors, to
gold compounds. We prioritized the top 29 hits from in
silico and in vitro screening that were of potential clinical
interest and then moved them forward for extensive in
vitro validation (Table 3).
Among the six most potent drugs from our screens
(i.e., auranofin, geldanamycin, vindesine, elesclomol,
daunorubicin, and MS-275), MS-275 and elesclomol are
the other two drugs that we are pursuing. MS-275 (also
known as entinostat) is a selective histone deacetylase
(HDAC) inhibitor which targets HDAC1 and HDAC3,
and it has been demonstrated to be reasonably safe and
effective in the treatment of a wide range of cancers,
including leukemia, lymphoma, melanoma, non-small-cell
lung cancer and breast cancer, both alone or in combination
of other therapies [36–42]. Entinostat is currently
marketed by Syndax and is in the phase III clinical trial
in combination with exemestane for the treatment of
patients with hormone receptor-positive advanced breast
cancer (NCT02115282). Meanwhile, two active phase II
clinical trials where non-small-cell-lung cancer patients
will be treated with entinostat before chemotherapy
(NCT01935947) and anti-PD1 treatment (NCT01928576)
are ongoing, which indicates the feasibility of combination
studies of entinostat with other targeted agents as an
epigenetic-based therapy in EWS treatment. Elesclomol
(STA-4783) is an investigational drug being developed
by Synta Pharmaceuticals and GlaxoSmithKline, which
exerts potent anticancer activity through the elevation
of reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels and is currently
in the phase II clinical evaluation as a novel anticancer
therapeutic in combination with paclitaxel in the treatment
of recurrent or persistent ovarian cancer (NCT00888615).
In addition, the Genomics of Drug Sensitivity in Cancer
(GDSC) database shows that cancer cells with EWS-FLI1
mutations are preferentially sensitive to elesclomol as
compare with the wide-type counterparts (http://www.
cancerrxgene.org/translation/Drug/1031#t_scatter_1031),
which is consistent with our in vitro drug screens. Further
mechanistic studies of entinostat and elesclomol in
Ewing sarcoma are underway (Ma and Godwin, personal
communications). In addition, the analogs of vindesine
and daunorubicin, named vincristine and doxorubicin,

respectively, are the first-line chemotherapies for EWS
treatment, which further validates our in silico and in vitro
screening approaches.
In these studies we were drawn to Auranofin
(Ridaura®) since it was a hit in both in silico and in
vitro screening. Auranofin is an oral gold complex, first
approved by FDA for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis
in 1985 [43]. However, the mechanism of action of
auranofin is not completely understood. In addition to its
anti-inflammatory activity, others and we have reported
that auranofin is a potent thioredoxin reductase (TrxR)
inhibitor with both in vitro and in vivo anticancer activities
[1, 25, 26, 44–54]. TrxR catalyzes the NADPH-dependent
reduction of oxidized thioredoxin and plays a central role
in regulating cellular redox homeostasis, cell growth, and
apoptosis. Increasing evidence shows that TrxR is overexpressed or constitutively active in many tumor cells.
Moreover, TrxR appears to contribute to increased tumor
cell growth and a resistance to chemotherapy. Others have
proposed that auranofin might be a selective inhibitor of
the oncogenic protein kinase C iota (PKCι) protein [55],
but others have yet to confirm.
As previously reported, Ridaura® was first
developed for the management of rheumatoid arthritis
as a disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drug (DMARD)
[56]. However, the adverse effects and the concerns about
the long-term consequences of the immunosuppression
induced by Ridaura® led to the decline in its use [57].
Although, auranofin has shown superior activity in
in vitro screens across several tumor types [49, 58–61], we
noted that it was not effective in other animal xenograft
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

models by our group when given orally (Ma, Pessetto,
and Godwin, unpublished data). The only in vivo efficacy
studies using auranofin that showed activity evaluate the
drug as a suspension/solution delivered i.p. [58, 62], but
neither studies performed formulations, dose tolerance,
or pharmacokinetics studies. Therefore, we sought to
determine if altering the route of delivery could replicate
the dramatic in vitro anticancer activity and improve its
efficacy in vivo. Previous studies have shown that orally
delivered auranofin is rapidly metabolized and intact
auranofin has never been detected in the blood [63].
Thus, studies of the pharmacokinetics of auranofin have
involved measurement of gold concentrations. Upon oral
administration, 25% of auranofin gets absorbed [18, 64].
The mean terminal plasma half-life of auranofin gold
at steady state in previous studies was 26 days (range
21 to 31 days; n = 5). The mean terminal body half-life
was 80 days (range 42 to 128; n = 5). About 60% of the
absorbed gold (15% of the administered dose) from a
single dose of auranofin is excreted in urine; the remaining
gold is excreted in feces [18]. To more closely mimic the
in vitro activity of auranofin, we evaluated alternative
routes of delivery and demonstrated that the amount of
gold from the i.p. suspension dose is 4 to 5 times that
obtained by the oral route.
Auranofin has been evaluated in the several cancer
clinical trials (clinicaltrials.gov). A clinical proof of
concept trial, evaluating auranofin as a single agent for
the treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) was
recently completed (clinicaltrials.gov, NCT01419691) by
University of Kansas Medical Center. Based on the initial
4088

Oncotarget

results in CLL, a multi-center clinical proof of concept
trial is currently being initiated to evaluate auranofin in
combination with bortezomib for the treatment of Mantle
Cell Lymphoma (Weir, personal communications). In a
recent clinical study, Jatoi and colleagues reported that
10 asymptomatic ovarian cancer patients with elevated
CA-125 received 3 mg of auranofin orally twice per day
and were evaluated for up to ~6 months. Although well
tolerated, oral delivery of auranofin had little effect or no
effect on improving progress-free survival; the median
PFS was 2.8 months (95% CI: 1.3–3.8) [65], further
suggesting our idea that the gold levels obtained via oral
delivery may be insufficient to achieve its optimal anticancer effects.
The other class of drugs identified in our study
is HSP90 inhibitors. HSP90 is a highly conserved
molecular chaperone protein that aids in the stability
and proper folding of client proteins. It is vital for cell
transformation, proliferation, and survival. Client proteins
that are dependent on HSP90 were identified in cancer
hallmarks such as growth and evasion of apoptosis.
Thus, HSP90 is considered as a potential target for
cancer therapy [66, 67]. Our validation screen identified
three HSP90 inhibitors: geldanamycin, ganetespib, and
AUY922. Geldanamycin, a benzoquinone ansamycin
with antibiotic and antitumor activities, was one of earliest
HSP90 inhibitors [68, 69]. The dependence on NAD(P)
H:quinone oxidoreductase and the gastrointestinal and
hepatic toxicities limited geldanamycin and its derivatives’
clinical use. Ganetespib and AUY922 emerged as secondgeneration, non-geldanamycin HSP90 inhibitors with
better pharmacokinetics and safety profiles [70, 71].
Ganetespib inhibits HSP90 protein by acting on the
ATP-binding domain at the N-terminus and has shown
a preclinical antitumor activity in several solid and
hematological tumors [17, 67, 68, 72, 73]. AUY922 is
an isoxazole-based HSP90 inhibitor that antagonizes the
ATPase activity of the protein. It has shown in vitro and
in vivo potent antitumor activity [72, 73]. Thirty eight
studies found for ganetespib on CllinicalTrials.gov. Two
trials were terminated with results as of July 20, 2016
(NCT01798485 and NCT01227018).
Even though the NCT01798485 trial showed no
safety issues with ganetespib, Synta suspended the phase 3
study of ganetespib in combination with docetaxel versus
docetaxel alone in patients with advanced non-small-cell
lung cancer. NCT01227018, a phase 2 study STA-9090
as second or third-line therapy for metastatic pancreas
cancer, was terminated due to interim analysis found the
study drug to be ineffective (15 patients were enrolled).
Three trials are recruiting patients with small cell lung
cancer, epithelial ovarian cancer, fallopian tube cancer,
primary peritoneal cancer, and breast cancer.
In the in vivo study, auranofin via i.p. delivery,
ganetespib, and the combination treatments significantly
increased the survival rate of the mice. The new route
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

of delivery of auranofin alone or in combination with
ganetespib did not show any noticeable toxicity or
adverse effects, except for a tail lesion in two mice
at the site of the i.v. injection of ganetespib. In all,
auranofin, an FDA-approved drug for the oral treatment
of rheumatoid arthritis, and ganetespib, an investigational
HSP90 inhibitor, were predicted to have activity in EWS.
Activity was subsequently confirmed in vitro via primary
and secondary screens. In vivo proof of principle was
demonstrated in a validated xenograft mouse model
of EWS. When given in combination, auranofin and
ganetespib were synergistic; however, reformulation of
auranofin was required to achieve anti-cancer levels of the
gold particle, suggesting caution when repurposing certain
drugs for cancer therapies, i.e., the potential need to
“repurpose” the formulation and delivery of a repurposed
drug for cancer therapy. Efforts are underway to translate
these findings to a clinical proof of concept study in EWS
patients with this debilitating and often-fatal disease.

with 1% penicillin/streptomycin and were maintained in
a 5% CO2 atmosphere at 37°C. The EWS fusion status of
each cell line is shown below (Table 1).

Aliquots of 25 µl CellTiter-Glo® Reagent (Promega) were
added directly to each well, the plates were incubated at
room temperature for 20 min and the luminescence signal
was measured according to the manufacturer’s protocol.
The measurements were made using Infinite® M200 Pro
plate reader (Tecan, Switzerland). Performance of the
assay was calculated and the Z’ factors were ≥ 0.5 [80].
Data were normalized to percentage inhibition. Samples
exhibiting > 50% growth inhibition in the presence of
1 µmol/L drug were classified as positive hits.

In silico prediction
Three in silico approaches (disease-based, siRNAbased, resistance-based approach) were used to predict
drugs for EWS. The workflow is shown in Figure 1 and the
details of the methods are described in the supplementary
material. Briefly, first, the drugs that are predicted to reverse
disease gene expression were identified. The disease gene
expression signature was created as the overlap of the
signatures from two meta-analysis studies [75, 76]. Next,
since the EWSR1/FLI1 fusion gene is thought to be a
causative mutation in most EWS, we searched for drugs
that possess the gene expression profile similar to the
silence of EWS/FLI1. The siRNA of EWS/FLI1 (siEWS/
FLI1) mediated signature was obtained from the previous
study [77]. Lastly, since a large number of EWS patients
are resistant to chemotherapy, we searched for drugs that
were predicted to sensitize drug resistance. The drug
resistance signature was computed by comparing the pretreatment samples of patients responding to chemotherapy
and those responding poorly to chemotherapy [78].
Drug expression signature database was built from the
Connectivity Map (CMap) [79] and part of the Library of
Integrated Cellular Signatures (LINCS, http://lincscloud.
org). The drug signatures that are not robust across multiple
experiments were removed. The comparison of disease
signatures and drug signatures was described previously
[13]. The negative score shows the drug signature is anticorrelated with the disease signature and the positive score
shows the drug signature is correlated with the disease
signature. A false discovery rate (FDR) value of less than
0.05 was used to select hits and only the top 20 hits in
each approach were selected for in vitro validation. The
drug hits predicted from the three approaches were merged.
We further manually selected drugs for in vitro validation
based on their availability in the in vitro screening library,
novelty and potential side effects.

Hits validation and combination study
For hits validation and combination study, cells
were harvested and aliquoted into 384-well plates at
concentrations of 750–1,500 cells per well in a total of
20 µl/well using a Matrix Wellmate (Thermo Scientific).
Five µl of culture media containing either vehicles
or drug were added to each well the next day (drug
concentrations range from 1 nmol/L to 50 µmol/L).
For combination study, selected drugs were archived
in robotically accessible plates, to which media was
added in preparation for addition to master plates by a
Nimbus 96 liquid-dispensing workstation (Hamilton).
Liquid transfers to dilution and assay plates were handled
using the same workstation. Each 384-well master plate
contained four 9 by 9 dose-matrix blocks, with eight serial
two-fold dilutions (concentrations range from 7.8 nmol/L
to 1 µmol/L). Additional wells were reserved for
untreated, and vehicle-treated control wells. Cell
proliferation was evaluated using Cell-Titer Glo® reagents
(Promega). IC50 values were determined for each drug
using SigmaPlot (Systat Software). The combination
index values were calculated using SigmaPlot (Systat
Software) and CompuSyn [25, 81–83].

Auranofin and ganetespib formulations
A parenteral suspension formulation was prepared
to support IP administration of auranofin in EWS
mouse xenograft studies. The injectable suspension
formulation contained 0.67 mg/ml of auranofin with
0.5% Hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC, viscosity
grade K4M) in 5% dextrose in water for injection (D5W).
Ganetespib was administered using an injectable solution
formulation (20% Cremophor RH40 and 80% D5W)
provided by Synta Pharmaceuticals.

In vitro high-throughput screening
Drugs or vehicle (DMSO) were preloaded by the
LDOSR as 250 nL aliquots on an Echo550 platform to
each well to give a final concentration of 1 µmol/L in a
total of 25 µL. Cells were grown to 80–90% confluence,
harvested and aliquoted into 384-well plates (black µClear
microplates, Greiner bio-one, Germany) at concentrations
of 750–1,500 cells per well in a total volume of 25 µl/well
using a Matrix Wellmate (Thermo Scientific). Cells were
cultured for 72 hours in a 5% CO2 atmosphere at 37°C.

Auranofin dose tolerance studies
The auranofin dose tolerance and pharmacokinetics
study protocols were approved by the KU-Lawrence
Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (KUIACUC). Subchronic dose tolerance studies were
conducted in BALB/c mice to support the design of EWS
mouse xenograft studies. By establishing the Maximum
4090

Oncotarget

Tolerated Dose (MTD), we defined the upper limit of
doses selected for EWS mouse xenograft and in vivo
pharmacokinetics studies. Mice received a single dose
of auranofin solution and suspension administered by
i.v. and i.p. routes of administration. Following a starting
dose of 1 mg/kg, doses were escalated in subsequent
mice until intolerable drug-related adverse effects were
observed. MTD was defined as the maximum dose that
was not associated dose-limiting adverse effects in mice.
The MTD was confirmed in a group of 3 mice. Mice were
continuously monitored for up to 4 hours post-dose.

week. When tumor size impeded mobility, mice were
sacrificed and necropsies were performed. Tumors were
then dissected, measured and processed for analysis. The
liver, kidneys, and spleen were also snap frozen in liquid
nitrogen or fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin and
paraffin embedded for toxicity studies. Tissues were then
subjected to hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining and
immunohistochemical staining. The immunohistochemical
staining method and antibodies used in the study were
listed in the supplementary data.

Data analysis and statistics

Auranofin pharmacokinetics

In vitro data were reported as mean ± SD of 3
independent experiments. In the statistical analyses
for the in vivo xenograft study, Kaplan-Meier survival
curves were used to determine the difference in survival
among the treatment groups. A p-value less than 0.05
was considered as statistically significant. All statistical
analyses were performed using SigmaPlot 12.3 (Systat
Software, Inc. CA, USE).

The single-dose plasma pharmacokinetics of
gold were characterized in 36 BALB/c mice following
administration of a single 12 mg/kg i.p. suspension
dose of auranofin. The mice were pretreated 24 hours
prior to auranofin, with a single 150 mg/kg i.v. dose
of ganetespib. Blood samples for determination of
blood gold concentration were obtained prior to, and at
5, 15, 30 and 60 minutes, 2, 4, 8, 12, 24 and 48 hours
following administration of auranofin. In addition, a
trough (plateau) blood sample, collected at 24 hours postdose, was obtained in mice following the fifth of five
consecutive 12 mg/kg once daily i.p. doses of auranofin
suspension. Blood samples were collected from each
animal via cardiac puncture. Whole blood aliquots of
500 µL obtained from each of the three animals per
time point were assayed using a validated inductively
coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICPMS) method
to quantify blood gold concentration. Mean blood gold
concentrations were determined for each blood collection
time point. Non-parametric pharmacokinetic data
analysis was performed on the resultant mean blood gold
concentration-time data using WinNonLin®, Version 6.2
(Centara USA, Inc, St. Louis, MO).

In vivo xenograft mouse model
The guidelines adopted by the Institutional Animal
Care and Use Committee of the University of Kansas
Medical Center (KUMC-IACUC) were followed in all
performed procedures. All experimental protocols were
approved by KUMC-IACUC. Homozygous athymic nude
(Foxn1nu/Foxn1nu) female mice at the age of 4-weeks
were purchased from Jackson Laboratories. After one
week, one million A673 cells in PBS (pH = 7.3) were
injected into mice. The cells were injected intramuscularly
proximal to the tibia and treatment started after 15 days
of inoculation. Mice developing palpable tumors were
divided into 4 arms and treated for up to 18 days: vehicle
(20% Cremophor RH40 and 80% D5W iv and 0.5%
HPMC K4M ip), auranofin (12 mg/kg i.p. injection 5 days
per week), ganetespib (150 mg/kg i.v. injection once
weekly), as well as auranofin and ganetespib combined.
