Epigenetic therapies by targeting aberrant histone methylome
in AML: molecular mechanisms, current preclinical and
clinical development
CT Tsai and CWE So
While the current epigenetic drug development is still largely restricted to target DNA methylome, emerging evidence indicates
that histone methylome is indeed another major epigenetic determinant for gene expression and frequently deregulated in acute
myeloid leukaemia (AML). The recent advances in dissecting the molecular regulation and targeting histone methylome in AML
together with the success in developing lead compounds speciﬁc to key histone methylation-modifying enzymes have revealed
new opportunities for effective leukaemia treatment. In this article, we will review the emerging functions of histone
methyltransferases and histone demethylases in AML, especially MLL-rearranged leukaemia. We will also examine recent preclinical
and clinical studies that show signiﬁcant promises of targeting these histone methylation-modifying enzymes for AML treatment.

INTRODUCTION
Although intensive chemotherapy combined with transplantation
of haematopoietic stem cells have considerably improved the
outcomes in certain subgroups of younger leukaemia patients,
acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) as the most common type of
acute leukaemia in adults remains highly fatal and around 80% of
patients aged over 60 succumb to the disease or the highly toxic
treatment regimens.1,2 AML is a heterogeneous group of diseases
that can be further classiﬁed into different subtypes according to
their distinctive genetic mutations with variable prognostic
signiﬁcances. In spite of the large arrays of mutations reported
in AML, most of them speciﬁcally affect transcription factors or key
components of epigenetic machinery. Importantly, chimeric
fusions that are believed to be the initiating events in translocation leukaemia almost always involve transcription/epigenetic
factors.3 Among them is the mixed lineage leukaemia gene (MLL)
that associates with a very poor prognosis and treatment
resistant.4 Similar mutational proﬁles affecting transcriptional
and epigenetic machinery have also been reported in normal
karyotype AML, where DNA methyltransferase 3A and NPM are
found to be the early events and persist during relapses,5–7
consistently indicating the importance of transcriptional deregulation in AML pathogenesis. In spite of our advance in understanding the genetics of AML, very little has been translated into
the clinics and we are still using the same highly toxic and rather
ineffective chemotherapies developed over a half-century ago.
Therefore, there is an urgent need to identify novel venues for
more potent and effective drug development to tackle this
formidable disease. While development of small-molecule inhibitors to transcription factors remains technically challenging, the
recent discoveries of critical function of epigenetic modifying
enzymes with structurally rigid motifs and/or catalytic domains in

AML pathogenesis have fuelled the enthusiasm to target these
intractable oncogenic events. In this review, we will focus on some
of the latest preclinical and clinical development of epigenetic
therapy in AML, in particular, those involve MLL gene
rearrangements.

EPIGENETIC THERAPIES TARGETING DNA METHYLATION AND
HISTONE ACETYLATION IN AML
The term epigenetics refers to alternations of gene expression
that are inheritable after cell division without any changes in
DNA sequence.8 In addition to DNA methylation, an increasing
number of epigenetic modiﬁcations on histones, including
acetylation, methylation and ubiquitination, have been identiﬁed
and are frequently deregulated in AML,9,10 resulting in repression
of tumour suppressor genes and/or activation of oncogenic
pathways.11 Aberrant DNA methylation and histone acetylation
are two most ancient and better characterized epigenetic
changes. DNA methylation, leading to gene silencing, is prevalent
in cancers including leukaemia, and has been the target for cancer
therapy since the FDA approval of DNA methyltransferase
inhibitors (DNMTi), azacytidine and decitabine for the treatment
of myelodysplastic syndrome and certain AML.12 Although
AML patients aged over 65 years who treated with DNMTi did
not show signiﬁcantly longer overall survival (OS) as compared
with conventional care regimen, azacytidine and decitabine
displayed safety and better clinical efﬁcacy in patients with
unfavourable cytogenetics or myelodysplasia-related changes,
indicating that they may be preferable therapies for these
‘difﬁcult-to-treat’ AML population.13,14 In addition to DNMTi, a
number of pan-histone deacetylase inhibitors inducing chromatin
remodelling and re-expression of tumour suppressor genes are

also designed and utilized in AML treatment.15 While single-agent
therapy was reported only having modest clinical activity,
combination of histone deacetylase inhibitors with DNMTi
(decitabine, complete remission: 31%) or with Ara-c (cytarabine,
complete remission: 78%, OS: 82 weeks) in clinical trials appeared
to be synergistic and profoundly improved responses.16,17
Although these early endeavours on heterogeneous myeloid
malignancies have demonstrated the safety and potential
therapeutic values of targeting epigenetic machinery in clinical
settings, it also urges the need of better understanding of the
epigenetic regulation and exploring novel critical targets for
effective AML treatment. To overcome the problems associated
with genetic heterogeneity that may, in part, account for the poor
efﬁcacy of DNMTi or histone deacetylase inhibitors in the clinics,
recent studies focusing on systematic analyses of leukaemia
carrying chimeric transcription factors or speciﬁc mutations
affecting histone methylation-modifying enzymes provide important insights and novel tractable targets for epigenetic therapies
in AML.
THE ROLE OF HISTONE METHYLTRANSFERASES IN AML
Depending on the position and nature of the methylated residues,
histone methylation can have positive as well as negative impacts
on gene expression.18 Histone methylation features epigenetic
modiﬁcation in which lysine and arginine residues can be mono(me1), di-(me2) or even tri-(me3) methylated (for lysine only). In
general, methylation of histone 3 lysine 4 (H3K4), lysine 36
(H3K36), lysine 79 (H3K79), as well as asymmetric dimethylation of
histone 4 arginine 3 (H4R3) activates gene expression; whereas
methylation on other sites like histone 3 lysine 9 (H3K9), lysine 27
(H3K27), histone 4 lysine 20 (H4K20) and symmetric dimethylation
of H4R3 associates with transcription repression.18,19 H3K4me3
and H3K27me3 that deﬁne bivalent marks are predominately
mediated by two master epigenetic regulators, trithorax group
proteins with HRX/MLL as the founding member and polycomb
group proteins with EZH1/2 as the catalytic subunits of polycomb
repressor complex 2 (PRC2) in mammalian cells.20 Intriguing, the
key components of both trithorax group and polycomb group
complexes are frequently mutated in AML.
Investigating the association of chromosome 7q abnormalities
in myeloid malignancy has revealed an important role of EZH2 in
leukaemogenesis. EZH2 regulates expression of numerous genes
critical for stem cell renewal by mediating a H3K27 methylation.21
EZH2 mutations were found in 9 of 12 patients with chromosome
7q acquired uniparental disomy, and the majority of EZH2
mutations resulted in loss of its H3K27 methyltransferase
activity,22 which is in contrast with its gain of function mutation
in B-cell lymphoma.23 Deletion of EZH2 was able to induce a
myelodysplastic syndrome-like disease in a mouse model,
suggesting the tumour suppressor function of EZH2 in certain
myeloid malignancies.24–26 On the other hand, loss-of-function
mutations of ASXL1, another polycomb group protein, are usually
associated with unfavourable OS and poor complete remission
rate in AML.27 Although its molecular function in leukaemic
transformation is still unclear, depletion of ASXL1 showed loss of
PRC2-mediated H3K27 trimethylation and led to upregulation of
HOXA genes including HOXA5 and HOXA9. On the contrary,
overexpression of ASXL1 resulted in a global increase of H3K27
me2/3 and suppression of HOXA genes and cell growth. ASXL1 can
interact with EZH2 in human leukaemic cells, and loss of ASXL1
resulted in displacement of PRC2 from HOXA loci.28 ASXL1 may
also collaborate with BAP1, loss of which led to a myelodysplastic
syndrome-like syndrome in a mouse model, to deubiquitinate
H2AK119 at polycomb group targets.29,30 Haematopoietic-speciﬁc
knockout of ASXL1 profoundly impaired cell differentiation and
induced myeloid dysplasia and erythroid dysplasia in knockout
mice. Furthermore, transplantation of ASXL1-null LSK cells or bone
Oncogene (2017) 1753 – 1759

marrow cells into recipient mice strikingly caused lethal myelodysplastic disorder.31 In addition to ASXL1, JARID2 has also been
identiﬁed as an essential cofactor in promoting PRC2 recruitment
to downstream targets. An acquisition of JARID2 mutation showed
a positive correlation with disease progress from myelodysplastic
syndrome to AML.32 Together, these studies reveal the critical role
of EZH2 and PRC2 in malignant haematopoiesis.
MLL as a master transcriptional and epigenetic regulator
containing a number of functional domains including AT hook
and CXXC motifs at the N-terminal and the C-terminal SET domain,
which mediates speciﬁc H3K4 methylation, is predisposed to
abnormal gene rearrangements resulting in a highly aggressive
form of leukaemia.33 As a result of chromosomal translocations,
chimeric MLL fusions resulting from replacement of C-terminal
region of MLL including the SET domain by various fusion partners
such as AF4/6/9/10, ELL and ENL can form macromolecular
complexes through recruitment of a cohort of cofactors including
super elongation complex (for example, positive transcription
elongation factor b, MLL fusion partners such as AF4 family and
AF9/ENL family), polymerase-associated factor complex, BRD3/4,
MENIN and key histone methyltransferases (HMTs) (for example,
DOT1L and protein arginine methyltransferases (PRMT1)) to activate
gene expression programmes crucial for the transformation18
(Figure 1a). Identiﬁcation of key aberrantly recruited HMTs by
MLL fusions provide the ﬁrst hint of their involvement in human
cancer.34
DOTlL is the only lysine methyltransferase (KMT) known to be
responsible for H3K79 methylation in humans. Aberrant recruitment of DOT1L speciﬁcally associates with an abnormally high
level of H3K79me2 on promoters and gene bodies of MLL targets
in MLL-rearranged leukaemia. The remarkable correlation of
H3K79me2 and MLL targets has been referred to as a special
epigenetic lesion in MLL leukaemia, implying the essentiality
of H3K79 methylation for MLL-driven transcription.35 Inactivation
of DOT1L profoundly suppressed the expression of MLL
translocation-associated genes (for example, HOXAs and MEIS1)
and leukaemia development36–40 (Figure 1a). Direct fusion of
DOT1L to MLL was sufﬁcient to activate transcription of HOXAs.39
Loss of DOT1L resulted in reduction of cell growth, increased
differentiation and apoptosis of MLL-AF9 leukaemic cells, indicating its potential as a target for AML therapy.38 On the other hand,
PRMT1 is the founding member of PRMTs that mediates arginine
methylation on both histone (H4R3me2a) and non-histone
substrates (for example, transcription factors and splicing factors).
Identiﬁcation of its essential function in MLL leukaemia had also
provided the ﬁrst evidence of PRMT involvement in human
cancer.41 PRMT1 recruitment is required for a subset of MLL
(MLL-EEN and MLL-GAS7) and non-MLL (MOZ-TIF2 and AML1-ETO)
leukaemia.41–43 Its inhibition resulted in speciﬁc transcriptional
and leukaemic suppression in MLL-rearranged and MOZ-TIF2
leukaemia.42 Silence of PRMT1with an short hairpin RNA (shRNA)
approach attenuated the level of H4R3me2a and gene expression
of HOXA9 and MEIS1, thus leading suppression of leukaemogenesis of MOZ-TIF2 and MLL-GAS7. More recently, a functional
link between PRC2 and MLL leukaemia had also been proposed.
EZH2 and EED, two core components of PRC2, had been shown to
be required for MLL leukaemia, although the underlying mechanisms remain largely unknown.44,45 While these studies highlight
the importance of HMTs in MLL leukaemia, emerging evidence
also reveals an equally important role of histone demethylases
(HDMs) that counteract the functions of HTMs in modulating the
epigenetic regulation of gene expression in both normal and
cancer settings.

Figure 1. Roles of HMTs and KDMs in MLL-driven transcription. (a) MLL fusion complexes are assembled by recruiting a body of important
components (super elongation complex, polymerase-associated factor complex, MENIN and LEDGF) to target and facilitate expression of
crucial leukaemogenic genes, such as HOXs, MEIS and MEF2C, where HMTs (DOT1L, PRMT1 and MLL) are involved to add active methyl marks
(H3K79me2/3, H4R3me2a and H3K4me3), respectively. BRD4, a histone mark reader, is essential for the recruitment of MLL fusions. (b) In
addition to enrichment of active marks, KDMs (e.g., KDM4C, JMJD1C) on the other hand remove repressive marks (H3K9me3) to underpin the
active status. Although LSD1 has been suggested to remove H3K4me1/2 marks in MLL leukaemia, its relevance to leukaemia suppression is
still largely unknown. (c) KDM5B negatively regulates MLL target genes through demethylation of H3K4me3 active mark. Black arrows indicate

acid residues, which can, however, be erased by HDMs mostly
lysine demethylases (KDMs). Based on their catalytic mechanisms,
KDMs can be divided into two major subgroups. The ﬁrst family
including KDM1A and KDM1B is also known as lysine-speciﬁc
demethylase (LSD), consisting of FAD-dependent amine oxidase,
which can only remove mono- and di-methyl marks.46 On the
contrary, the second KDM family contains JmjC domain (JMJD),
which relies on α-ketoglutarate, Fe(II) and oxygen as cofactors to
mediate demethylation of mono-, di- and even tri-methyl-lysine
residues.47 JMJD demethylases consist of more diverse family
members and can be further divided into seven subfamilies
from KDM2 to KDM8 according to their other structurally
conserved domains like PHD and Tudor domains, which may
also bear crucial functions in recognising/reading the histone
marks.19
KDMs can be found differentially expressed in various cancers
including leukaemia, and cooperate with transcription factors to
activate or repress gene expression. LSD1 is overexpressed in MLL
leukaemia and seems to have a crucial role in sustaining the
oncogenic transcriptional programmes mediated by MLL fusions
via an unknown mechanism (Figure 1b). LSD1 suppression by an
shRNA approach led to a reduction of mouse MLL leukaemic stem
cells (LSCs).48 Although this study suggests a requirement of H3K4
demethylase for MLL leukaemia, a recent report revealed an
opposite role of H3K4 demethylase KDM5B that negatively
regulated MLL LSC (Figure 1c).49 In this study, H3K4me2/3 but
not H3K79me2 were critical for MLL LSC, and H3K4 methylation
levels reduced during differentiation. Suppression of KDM5B
signiﬁcantly promoted disease progression, whereas its overexpression inhibited MLL leukaemia. While the reasons underlying
the different results need further investigations, LSD1 on the other
hand underpins retinoic acid receptor (RARa)-driven repression of
myeloid differentiation-associated genes in AML through decreasing the level of H3K4me2.50 These results may suggest a more

generic role of H3K4 methylation in AML pathogenesis, which may
not be speciﬁc to MLL leukaemia. Other members of KDMs
including KDM2B and JMJD1C also implicate in AML pathogenesis.
H3K36me2 demethylase KDM2B that silences p15 expression was
sufﬁcient to transform haematopoietic progenitors in vitro, and its
depletion signiﬁcantly impaired HOXA9/MEIS1-driven leukaemogenesis and self-renewal of LSCs.51 H3K9 demethylase JMJD1C
was identiﬁed as a crucial factor for the maintenance of AML
expressing MLL-AF9 in an shRNA functional screen (Figure 1b).
Depletion of JMJD1C inhibited cell growth and leukaemogenesis
of MLL-AF9 cells by triggering apoptosis.52 JMJD1C had also been
recently implicated in AML1-ETO-53 and HOXA9-mediated
leukaemias.54 JMJD1C was identiﬁed as a coactivator in AETFC,
a complex formed by AML1-ETO, where JMJD1C maintained low
level of H3K9me2, hence enhancing gene expression of AML1-ETO
targets. Knockdown of JMJD1C compromised the ability of AML1ETO to inhibit cell differentiation and impaired colony formation.53
JMJD1C also interacted with HOXA9 to modulate the downstream
genes critical for self-renewal of LSCs. Loss of JMJD1C profoundly
affected leukaemic transformation driven by HOXA9, indicating
yet another KDM family member with a more generic function in
AML pathogenesis.54
CROSSTALK BETWEEN HMTS AND HDMS IN AML
Although the above reports have directly implicated individual
HMT and HDM in AML pathogenesis, their mode of actions and
underlying mechanisms remain largely unknown. Recent studies
exploring the functional crosstalk between HMTs and HDMs have
shed lights into the intricate molecular regulation of aberrant
histone methylome in AML. It has been demonstrated that the
chromatin localisation of SIRT1, a H3K9 deacetylase, and SUV39H1,
a H3K9 methyltransferase, may be disrupted by DOT1L (Figure 2a).
After inhibition of DOT1L, SIRT1 and SUV39H1 bound to MLL

1756
targets such as HOXA7 and MEIS1 and exerted their function to
establish a heterochromatin-like state, in which the level of
H3K9me2 but not H3K79me2 was kept considerably high.
Deletion of SIRT1 or SUV39H1 signiﬁcantly desensitised MLL-AF9
leukaemic cells to DOT1L inhibition, whereas pharmacological
activation of SIRT1 by SRT1720 strikingly improved the in vivo
efﬁcacy of EPZ4777, a DOT1L inhibitor, demonstrating a critical
function of this crosstalk in regulating DOT1L inhibitor
sensitivity.55 To search for novel epigenetic regulators that
cooperate with PRMT1 in AML pathogenesis, KDM4C was
identiﬁed to speciﬁcally interact with MLL fusions and MOZ-TIF2
to remove H3K9me3 repressive mark.42 Together with PRMT1,
KDM4C co-regulated the epigenetic programmes for transcriptional deregulation and cellular transformation by increasing the
H4R3me2a active mark but attenuating H3K9me3 repressive mark
on MLL downstream targets such as HOXA9 (Figure 2b). Similar to
PRMT1, shRNA-mediated suppression of KDM4C resulted in
repression of MLL downstream gene expression programmes,
attenuation of leukaemogenesis and a signiﬁcant improvement of
OS in mouse and humanized models, revealing the requirement of
the presence of both epigenetic modifying enzymes for the
oncogenic functions of MLL fusions. As KDM4C binds to MLL
N-terminus region, KDM4C is also required for leukaemia induced
by other MLL fusions independent on PRMT1, suggesting a much
broader function of KDM4C in maintaining aberrant epigenetic
networks in MLL leukaemia. Interestingly, a recent study
suggested a potential redundant function among KDM4 family
members in AML using a tamoxifen inducible knockout
approach.56 Although characterisation of the actual genotype on
Kdm4c knockout leukaemic cells was not performed, genetic
escape from in vivo deletion of Kdm4 family seems to be a
common theme in all the resultant leukaemia with genotyping
results, which was in line with the requirement of a very high
dose of tamoxifen to achieve even in vitro deletion. Nevertheless,

transcription. (a) When DOT1L is recruited by MLL fusions, it confers
H3K79me2 active mark, which may further expel SUV39H1 and
SIRT1, hence leading to a reduction in H3K9me2 repressive mark but
an increase in H3K9ac activation mark. (b) After binding to MLL
fusions and MOZ-TIF2, PRMT1 and KDM4C cooperate to maintain
the activation of MLL-driven transcription by conferring a high level
of H4R3me2a, but a low level of H3K9me3 repressive mark.
Oncogene (2017) 1753 – 1759

these studies consistently indicate critical functions of KDM4
family in acute leukaemogenesis.
THE ROLE OF KDM IN TREATMENT RESPONSE
In addition to disease progression, KDM has also been implicated
in governing treatment response in acute promyelocytic leukaemia (APL) driven by RARa fusions. APL is the only AML subgroup
with a well-established targeted therapy where all trans retinoic acid
(ATRA) can induce transcriptional de-repression and leukaemic
differentiation. In spite of success in identifying repressor
complexes associated with RARa fusions, the identity of the
activator being recruited by the fusions upon ATRA treatment had
remained elusive. To search for such a regulator, PHF8 (KDM7B),
a H3K9 demethylase, was found to speciﬁcally interact with
RARa fusion proteins to remove H3K9me2 repressive mark upon
ATRA treatment57 (Figure 3). ATRA treatment results in a
conformation change of RARa fusions, leading to dissociation of
corepressors such as histone deacetylase and PRC2. PHF8 acts as a
critical sensor for ATRA treatment response, which is dependent
on both the enzymatic activity and the phosphorylation status of
two critical serine residues of PHF8 that partly determine its
chromatin localisation. Genetic or pharmacological activation of
PHF8 sensitized ATRA refractory cells to the treatment, whereas its
suppression conferred resistance to APL cells. These ﬁndings for
the ﬁrst time directly implicate the activity of KDM in governing
AML treatment responses, and reveal a novel therapeutic venue to
overcome treatment resistant.58 In addition to PHF8, LSD1 is also
involved in the repressive machinery of RAR fusions (Figure 3).
Inhibition of LSD1 could increase the level of H3K4me2 on the
promoters of myeloid differentiation-associated genes and

Figure 3. Roles of KDMs in ATRA therapeutic response. PML–RARa
forms a repressor complex with RXRa, HDACs and PRCs to inhibit
the expression of myeloid differentiation-associated genes. In nonAPL, LSD1 is also recruited to further remove H3K4me2/1,
contributing to a more stable repressive status (not shown in
ﬁgure). ATRA treatment results in a conformational change of PML–
RARa, leading to dissociation of HDACs and PRCs, and recruitment
of phosphorylated PHF8 to confer transcriptional activation.
Activation of PHF8 by okadaic acid (OKA) may sensitise refractory
APL cells to ATRA treatment.

triggered ATRA therapeutic response in non-APL AML. Although
ATRA exhibited little effects in non-APL AML, combination of ATRA
and the LSD1 inhibitor TCP remarkably initiated cell differentiation
of non-APL AML and reduced colony formation and engraftment
of AML.50
HISTONE METHYLOME AS AN EMERGING THERAPEUTIC
TARGET
Given the critical functions of histone methylome in AML, the ﬁrst
HMT inhibitor targeting DOT1L, EPZ477759 and its secondgeneration derivative, EPZ567660 have been developed and
tested for suppressing MLL leukaemia. Both compounds showed
selective inhibitory effects on H3K79 methylation and cells bearing
MLL fusions (Table 1). Continuous infusion of DOT1L inhibitors
signiﬁcantly prolonged the OS in murine models with MLL
leukaemia,59,60 leading to the ﬁrst clinical trial of HMT inhibitors
in AML. However, the undesirable pharmacokinetic characteristics
of the DOT1L inhibitors may limit their clinical development,60 and
can be partly responsible for the rather modest clinical responses
in their early trial results. On the other hand, a PRMT1 inhibitor,
AMI-408 could also signiﬁcantly extend disease latency and OS in
mouse models carrying MLL-GAS7 fusion or MOZ-TIF2.42 Similarly
to DOT1L inhibitors, the efﬁcacy of PRMT1 inhibitors in leukaemia
suppression was far inferior to those by genetic or shRNA
approaches, indicating the need to improve the pharmacokinetics
of these early phase inhibitors. Studies also reported prolonged
OS and reduced tumour burden in MLL-AF9 leukaemia model by
targeting of a H3K27 methyltransferase EZH2. The EZH2 inhibitor
DZNep triggered apoptosis of AML cells through reactivating
TXNIP, leading to the accumulation of reactive oxygen species.61
Depletion of EZH2 or pharmacological inhibition of EZH1/2 by a
small-molecule UNC1999 upregulated PRC2 target genes such as
p16 and p19 in MLL leukaemic cells.62,63 There are also highly
effective EZH2 inhibitors such as GSK126 and EPZ5687 for diffuse
Table 1.

large B-cell lymphoma.64,65 GSK126 and stapled hydrocarbon
peptide targeting EZH/EED interaction have been tested in parallel
and shown strong suppression of in vitro MLL leukaemia cell
growth, although their in vivo efﬁcacy has yet to be
demonstrated.66
Similarly, while very limited in vivo data has been shown, a
monoamine oxidase inhibitor, tranylcypromine (TCP) alone or in
combination with ATRA has been used to suppress LSD1 activity in
MLL48 or non-MLL leukaemia in vitro50 (Table 1), respectively.
A TCP derivative, GSK2879552 has entered phase I clinical trials
for the treatment of relapsed AML (ClinicalTrials.gov identiﬁer:
NCT02177812), however TCP exhibited severe toxicity at efﬁcacious doses in preclinical models, so it is possible that the TCP may
result in broad toxicity, especially in central nervous system.67
Recently, a non-monoamine oxidase inhibitor SP2509 with similar
efﬁcacy but lower general toxicity as compared with TCP was
developed (Table 1). SP2509 blocked the interaction between
LSD1 and the co-repressor CoREST, thus leading to a permissive
increase in H3K4me3 on target genes such as p21, p27 and CCAAT/
enhancer-binding protein. SP2509 was able to effectively suppress
colony formation, induced cell differentiation and triggered
apoptosis of AML cells with mutant NPM1 but not MLL
fusions.68 However, while inhibition of LSD1 showed a signiﬁcant
efﬁcacy in a mouse xenograft model, it could only consistently
translate into extended OS when it was a combination with PS, a
pan-histone deacetylase inhibitor.68 It is noted that all the above
epigenetic targets, in particular, DOT1L and LSD1 are absolutely
essential for normal development and haematopoietic stem cells,
which may limit the application of effective dose in patients and,
therefore, a combination approach with lower dose may be
beneﬁcial. On the other hand, KDM4C is largely dispensable for
normal development and its complete deletion does not lead to
any signiﬁcant phenotypes in the mouse model. Consistently, an
early phase KDM4C inhibitor, SD70 displayed an excellent
therapeutic effect on AML expressing MOZ-TIF2 and MLL

Transcriptional deregulation plays the key role in acute leukaemogenesis and, probably, treatment responses. The emerging
functions of various epigenetic modifying enzymes of histone
methylome in AML pathogenesis have provided unique opportunities to target this group of dismal disease, in which its treatment
regime has not really changed for decades. In addition to the
histone mark writers and erasers, it is also possible to target
readers that are essential to recognize these speciﬁc histone
marks for aberrant gene expression and transformation. It has
been proposed that WDR5, one of the main components of MLL
complexes essential for MLL histone methyltransferase activity,
recognises H3K4me and presents the K4 side chain for further
methylation by MLL.49,69,70 Blocking MLL1–WDR5 interaction by a
small-molecule inhibitor MM-401 speciﬁcally reduced levels of
H3K4me at HOXA loci, induced myeloid differentiation and
triggered apoptosis of mouse MLL-AF9 leukaemic cells.71 In
addition to WRD5 family, signiﬁcant progress has been made to
target bromodomain that recognizes acetyl-lysine marks. One of
the best examples is the potential targeting of BRD family in MLL
leukaemia. Genetic or pharmacological inhibition of BRD3/4 by
I-BET151 (GSK1210151A) or JQ1 led to the suppression of BCL-2,
Myc and CDK6 in leukaemic cells, and displayed outstanding
efﬁcacy against mouse and human leukaemia cells driven by MLL
fusions in vitro and in vivo (Table 1).72,73 Although rapid
development of drug resistant in preclinical models, in part, due
to activation of canonical Wnt/b-catenin signalling may pose a
threat for effective treatments by BRD inhibitors,74,75 these studies
provide an important proof-of-principle data showing the
feasibility of targeting protein–protein interaction involved in
epigenetic regulation for leukaemia treatment. Similar principles
will likely be applicable to other readers involved in histone
methylome such as chromodomain and PHD domain. Future
studies in dissecting the molecular regulation of critical histone
methylome writers, readers and erasers will open up a promising
venue for the development of next-generation effective AML
treatments.
