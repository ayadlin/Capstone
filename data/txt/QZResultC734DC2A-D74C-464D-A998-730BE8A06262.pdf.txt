ABSTRACT
The extracellular matrix plays a fundamental role in physiological and pathological
proliferation. It exerts its function through a signal cascade starting from the integrins
that take direct contact with matrix constituents most of which behave as proproliferative clues. On the contrary, EMILIN1, a glycoprotein interacting with the α4β1
integrin through its gC1q domain, plays a paradigmatic anti-proliferative role. Here,
we demonstrate that the EMILIN1-α4 interaction de-activates the MAPK pathway
through HRas. Epithelial cells expressing endogenous α4 integrin and persistently
plated on gC1q inhibited pERK1/2 increasing HRasGTP and especially the HRasGTP
ubiquitinated form (HRasGTP-Ub). The drug salirasib reversed this effect. In addition,
only the gC1q-ligated α4 integrin chain co-immunoprecipitated the ubiquitinated
HRas. Only epithelial cells transfected with the wild type form of the α4 integrin chain
showed the EMILIN1/α4β1/HRas/pERK1/2 link, whereas cells transfected with a α4
integrin chain carrying a truncated cytoplasmic tail had no effect. In this study we
unveiled the pathway activated by the gC1q domain of EMILIN1 through α4β1 integrin
engagement and leading to the decrease of proliferation in an epithelial system.

consequences during persistent cell adhesion. In most cell
types the ERK pathway which is activated by RAS is one
of the key pathways required to trigger cell proliferation.
In order to exert its function RAS is farnesylated and then
it associates with the plasma membranes [4]. RAS has
the inherent ability to undergo conformational changes
and functions as a molecular switch that catalyzes the
hydrolysis of GTP returning it to the inactive GDP-bound
state [5]. Among RAS inhibitors shown to be promising in
clinical trials [6], salirasib, that is a farnesylthiosalicylic
acid specific H-RAS inhibitor, dislodges the RAS isoforms
from their membrane-anchoring sites, thereby preventing
the activation of the RAS signaling cascade [7, 8].
EMILIN1 (Elastic Microfibril Interface Located
ProteIN) is a homotrimeric ECM multidomain glycoprotein
associated with elastic fibers [9] and particularly
abundant in skin. EMILIN1 is characterized by a region
homologous to the globular domain of C1q (gC1q domain)

INTRODUCTION
Integrins are heterodimeric cell membrane receptors
which mediate cell interaction with the extracellular
matrix (ECM). The integrins sense the composition and
the mechanical tension within the pericellular milieu,
and transmit this information intracellularly to signalling
pathways which regulate cell fate by influencing
cellular motility, apoptosis, differentiation as well as cell
proliferation [1]. Upon engagement integrins rapidly
activate signaling pathways mediated by their cytoplasmic
domains and proteins with enzymatic activities like
RasGTPases are recruited to the sites of cell adhesion to
ECM. Integrin engagement by ECM, besides activating
the RAS/ERK pathway, also can lead to mobilization of
intracellular Ca2+ and influx from the extracellular space [2,
3]. While the early events upon integrin engagement have
been deeply investigated, less known are the downstream

at the C-terminal end [10, 11] involved in EMILIN1
oligomerization [12] and in cell adhesion and migration via
interaction with the α4β1 integrin [13]. To investigate the
role of EMILIN1 in vivo we generated KO mice and found
that the lack of EMILIN1 results in: i) a mild phenotype
of lymphatic capillaries [14] and vessels [15, 16] with
increased lymphatic endothelial cell proliferation and ii) a
skin hyperproliferative phenotype [17].
Ligand-activated integrins in general positively
regulate cell growth [18–20]. In contrast, signals emanating
from EMILIN1-ligated α4β1 integrin are anti-proliferative
due to the increased levels of PTEN and decrease of
pEKR1/2 [17]. However, the pathway(s) through which
integrin-bound EMILIN1 exerts its negative regulatory
function on cell proliferation remain(s) to be fully clarified.
For instance, the role and the link between α4β1 and the
small GTPases has not been determined yet.
In the present study, in order to mimic the in vivo
conditions of cell-ECM interaction, we used a persistent

cell adhesion approach to further investigate how the
α4β1/EMILIN1 pair controls cell proliferation. We found
that this is exerted via downmodulation of the HRas
pathway through the HRasGTP ubiquitination.

RESULTS
Downstream effects of persistent cell adhesion
to gC1q
Phosphorylation of FAK(Tyr925) generates a
binding site for SH2 bearing molecules and triggers a
RAS-dependent activation of the MAP kinase pathway
[21]. In HaCat keratinocytes persistently adherent to gC1q
(i.e. after 24h adhesion) FAK(Tyr925) resulted increased if
compared to polylysine attachment, whereas FAK(Tyr397)
did not change (Figure 1A). On the contrary, pERK1/2
was dramatically reduced on gC1q at these late times of
adhesion. To test if the active form of HRas (HRasGTP)

was involved in cellular signals triggered by EMILIN1/
gC1q, first a HRasGTP pull-down assay was performed
on HaCat cells plated on gC1q or polylysine and analyzed
24h after plating. HRasGTP increased in cells plated on
gC1q compared to polylysine (Figure 1B).
In addition to the HRasGTP 21 kDa band, an upper
band of about 40 kDa was detected by the anti HRas
antibody (Figure 1B). Beside the canonical 21 kDa,
RAS proteins display a plethora of faster and slower
bands corresponding to the post-translational modified
forms or to the mono- (30 kDa) and di-ubiquitinated (40
kDa) forms, respectively [22–25]. In our experiments
the intensity of the 40 kDa band, corresponding to the
di-ubiquitinated HRasGTP (HRasGTP-Ub) form, was
several-fold higher on gC1q compared to polylysine,
suggesting that, following α4β1 integrin activation as a
consequence of cell adhesion to gC1q, HRasGTP could
be ubiquitinated.

Cells were placed on polylysine, collagen type I,
or gC1q for 24 hours and at the end of the incubation
the cells lysates were immunoprecipitated with the
α4 antibody and immunoblotted with anti HRas
antibody. As expected, the α4 integrin chain was
immunoprecipitated from cells adherent on each ligand;
however, the ubiquitinated form of HRas (40 kDa mass)
co-immunoprecipitated with the α4 integrin chain only
in cells adhered to gC1q (Figure 2B). In fact, a band at
the expected molecular mass was detected in the lysate
and in the unbound cell lysate when probed with anti
HRas antibody. Here, the HRasGTP and HRasGDP
ubiquitinated forms cannot be distinguished since the
lysates were co-immunoprecipitated and not pulled down
for HRasGTP. However, as shown in Figure 1C where
the amount of HRasGTP-Ub is much higher than the
amount of HRasGDP-Ub, it is very likely that the coimmunoprecipitated HRas-Ub, in cells adhered to gC1q,
is primarily due to the HRasGTP membrane-bound form.
To demonstrate if this pathway (HRasGTP →
HRasGTP-Ub → pERK1/2) was directly linked to the α4
integrin chain, we selected the HT29 and SW480 cell lines
that were negative for α4β1 and positive for α2β1 integrin
(Figure 3A). Both cell lines were then stably transfected
with either the wild type or an α4 integrin chain deleted
of the intracytoplasmic sequences (Figure 3B). For the
following experiments only cells that resulted at least
95% positive for the expression of the α4 integrin chain
were used. Both HT29 and SW480 transfected with either
the wild type or the deleted α4 form were able to adhere
to gC1q although HT29 cells were more efficient than
SW480 cells as the percentage of adhesion to gC1q was
90% and 60%, respectively (Figure 3C and 3D). Thus,
for the following experiments we selected HT29 cells.
Several clones transfected with either the wild type or the
mutant α4 integrin chain were selected and the clones in
which the α4 cell surface expression was more stable were
further used. We measured the proliferative capacity of the
transfected cells grown on collagen type I or EMILIN1/
gC1q and found that the proliferation rate (measured as
either normalized cell index or doubling time) of the cells
transfected with either the wild type or the mutated α4
form was very similar on collagen type I. On the contrary,
the proliferation rate was significantly lower on the full
length EMILIN1 or gC1q in cells transfected with the
wild type α4 integrin chain compared to cells transfected
with the deleted form in which the proliferation was
not affected at all (Figures 4 A and 4B). These results
show that the downstream signaling leading to reduced
proliferation following α4β1-dependent cell adhesion to
the EMILIN1/gC1q ligand depended on a fully functional
α4 integrin chain. To link the proliferative and clonogenic
capacity to the α4β1 integrin-dependent HRas activity we
placed HT29 transfected clones in agar in the presence
or in the absence of soluble gC1q. Whereas the colonies

The HRas-ERK1/2 pathway is inactivated via
the α4 integrin chain
To determine if the downstream consequences of
cell adhesion to gC1q were dependent on a mechanism
specifically due to the ligation of the α4β1 integrin, we
compared the extent of di-ubiquitinated HRasGTP in
cells adherent to gC1q to that detected in cells adherent
to collagen type I that uses a different integrin as cellular
receptor. As depicted in Figure 1C both the anti ubiquitin
antibody as well as the anti HRas antibody recognized
proteins whose migration corresponded to the HRasGTP
di-ubiquitinated form. HRasGTP-Ub was 10 times less in
cells adherent to polylysine as well as to collagen type
I compared to gC1q (Figure 1C), suggesting that the
α4-dependent signaling was qualitatively/quantitatively
distinct and specific. Accordingly, while the ratio of
HRasGTP-Ub/HRasGDP-Ub was about 0.5 in cells
adherent to either polylysine or collagen type I, this ratio
was 10-fold in cells adherent to gC1q, indicating that in
α4-dependent cell adhesion there is a specific switch from
RasGDP to RasGTP.

The gC1q ligated α4 integrin chain is physically
linked to HRas and controls cell growth
To proof the physiological link between cell
adhesion via the α4β1 integrin and HRas we used HaCat
cells that endogenously express the α4 integrin chain. We
confirmed that the adhesion of HaCat cells to the gC1q or
the collagen type I ligands was due to the α4β1 or the α2β1
integrins, respectively, by performing cell adhesion in the
presence of the specific integrin blocking antibodies. Thus,
the α4β1 mAb greatly reduced cell adhesion to gC1q and
the α2β1 mAb fully inhibited cell adhesion to collagen
type I (Figure 2A).

of the cells transfected with the wild type α4 integrin
chain were significantly less in the presence of gC1q
(Figure 4C), the colonies of HT29 transfected with the
mutant α4 integrin grew to the same number under all the
experimental conditions (Figure 4D).
Moreover, the analysis of extracts from HT29 cells
showed that the ratio of HRasGTP-Ub/HRasGDP-Ub
in cells stably transfected with the wild type α4 integrin
chain and adherent on collagen type I for 24 h was around
1.0; on the contrary and in analogy with data obtained on
HaCat cells (see Figure 1C), this ratio was around 4.0 in
cells adherent on gC1q (Figure 4E). Our explanation is
that after its activation HRas-GTP was directed towards
ubiquitination. The ratio of HRasGTP-Ub/HRasGDPUb in cells transfected with the deleted α4 integrin chain
and adherent on gC1q decreased accordingly compared

to cells transfected with the wild type α4 integrin chain
(Figure 4E), confirming that this pathway depended on the
presence of a fully functional α4 integrin chain.
To prevent HRas pathway activation we interfered
with the membrane anchoring of HRas after its
farnesylation by treating cells with salirasib. Accordingly,
after salirasib treatment both HRasGTP as well as the
HRasGTP-Ub forms were detected neither in cell adherent
to gC1q nor to polylysine (Figure 5A).
Integrin engagement by ECM constituents leads to
changes of Ca2+ levels by internal release and external
influx that are responsible for controlling a plethora of
cellular processes [2, 26–28]. Thus, FLUO-4 AM was
loaded in HaCat cells to determine if there was any
variation of cytosolic Ca2+ levels during the modulation
of the HRasGTP/GDP cycling. Cells persistently plated

Ca2+ respect to cells plated on gC1q (Figure 5B). When
DMSO, that is used as vehicle of salirasib, was added
to the cells as control, the cytoplasmic Ca2+ levels were
changed, i.e. very low in cells persistently adherent to

polylysine and, on the contrary, high in cells adherent to
gC1q (Figure 5B). DMSO increased the 40 kDa band,
likely the di-ubiquitinated HRasGTP (HRasGTP-Ub),
in cells adherent to polylysine (see Figure 1B), whereas
this band disappeared in cells adherent to gC1q (Figure

5A). Concomitantly, DMSO upregulated pERK1/2 in
cells plated on gC1q, respect to polylysine (Figure 5C).
On the other hand, salirasib reverted the downstream
effects on both types of coatings respect to the DMSO
alone. Of note the finding that the levels of pERK1/2
showed an inverse correlation with the 40 kDa band
intensity.
We then investigated if the inhibition of HRas
membrane anchoring and activation by salirasib affected
downstream signaling related to cell proliferation. While
there was no significant effect on pFAK levels (Figure
5C), the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 was increased on
polylysine when HRasGTP was inibited by salirasib; in

contrast, this treatment decreased pERK1/2 levels in cells
adherent to gC1q respect to control (Figure 5C). The
treatment with salirasib greatly decreased ubiquitination
of HRasGTP and increased cytosolic HRas (HRasGDP)
on cell plated on either polylysine or gC1q (Figure 5D).
The number of colonies grown in agar of HT29
cells transfected with the wild type α4 integrin chain was
significantly reduced only when plated in the presence of
gC1q (Figure 6). The rescue effect by salirasib was not
observed under all other conditions, i.e. salirasib and
cells transfected with the truncated α4 integrin chain,
DMSO with both types of cells. This demonstrated that,
by knocking down HRasGTP and thus HRasGTP-Ub, the

turn led to the downregulation of pERK1/2 proliferation
signals (see Figure 7 for a schematic representation). The
persistent cell adhesion in vitro is reminiscent of the in
vivo condition in which cells are in continuous relationship
with the constituents of the ECM. The present findings
further explain the peculiar role played by EMILIN1 in
the maintenance of cell growth homeostasis in the skin
[17]. The EMILIN1/α4β1/HRas/pERK1/2 pathway was
specific for the α4β1/EMILIN1 pair since cells persistently

DISCUSSION
We demonstrated here that epithelial cells expressing
the α4β1 integrin and persistently engaged in vitro with the
ECM glycoprotein EMILIN1/gC1q promoted an integrindependent downregulation of HRas signaling. This in

adherent to collagen type I via the α2β1 integrin did not
show enhanced HRasGTP degradation: consequently,
the levels of pERK1/2 were unchanged and the cell
proliferation was not affected. Moreover, the finding
that the α4 integrin chain was co-immunoprecipitated
with HRas-Ub only in cells adherent to gC1q and not to
polylysine nor to collagen type I indicated that there was
a physical association between the α4 integrin chain and
HRas-Ub. The reduction of the downstream signaling by
HRas required the full integrity of the α4 integrin chain
as HT29 cells transfected with a truncated integrin α4
chain were unable to promote HRasGTP ubiquitination
and to affect ERK1/2 phosphorylation and hence cell
proliferation.
The fact that in HaCaT keratinocytes persistently
adherent on gC1q the salirasib vehicle DMSO increased
the low basal Ca2+ level leading to reduced HRasGTP-Ub
and increased pERK1/2, while the opposite was observed
on polylysine, indicates that the effects of DMSO were
specifically linked to the α4β1 integrin activation by the

gC1q ligand. DMSO can induce transient water pores in
cell membranes increasing permeability [29]. Ca2+ can
easily flow through these pores [30, 31]. It is noteworthy
that free cytosolic Ca2+ is a positive regulator of Ras
GTPase Activating Proteins (GAPs) such as CAPRI and
RASAL that are responsible for converting HRasGTP
to HRasGDP [32–34]; it reduces the levels of HRasGTP
and thus of RAS-dependent ERK phosphorylation [35].
Salirasib, which interferes with membrane achoring of
HRas, reverted the downstream effects caused by DMSO
on persistently adherent cells.
The salirasib-induced reduction in the amount of
HRasGTP was the consequence of its dislodgment with
increased cytosolic HRasGDP form. Nevertheless, the
activation of the α4β1 integrin after engagement by gC1q
and the ubiquitination of HRasGTP downregulated cell
proliferation under both 2D and 3D conditions.
In conclusion, the α4β1 integrin engagement
by the gC1q triggers a series of events leading to the
ubiquitination and degradation of HRasGTP. In turn,

Figure 7: A schematic view of the HRas involvement in gC1q-α4β1 integrin mediated pathway. A. In cells plated on

polylysine the α4β1 inactive integrin is not able to induce HRas activation. High basal level of intracellular Ca2+ is known to modulate the
activity of RAS and to activate ERK1/2. B. Activation of α4β1 integrin, mediated by gC1q, through FAK induces HRasGTP increase as
well as its ubiquitination (HRasGTP-Ub). HRasGTP switching off along with low basal level of intracellular Ca2+ is able to reduce ERK1/2
phosphorylation and proliferation. C, D. Salirasib dislodges HRas from plasma membrane preventing its activation and ubiquitination. On
the other hand, low levels of cytoplasmic Ca2+, in cells plated on polylysine, lead to low ERK1/2 phosphorylation; on the contrary, high
levels of cytoplasmic Ca2+, in cells plated on gC1q rescue the level of pERK1/2.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cells and extracellular matrix ligands
HaCat (immortalized human keratinocytes) cell line
was kindly provided by Dr. Lawrence Banks (ICGEB,
Trieste). The human HT29 and SW480 colon cancer
cells were obtained from the American Type Culture
Collection (Rockville, MD). These cells were maintained
in continuous culture in humidified 5% CO2 at 37°C
using DMEM (Life Technologies, Inc., Gaithersburg,
MD) supplemented with glutamine, antibiotics and
10% heat-inactivated FCS (Gibco, Thermo Fisher
Scientific, Waltham, MA USA). Rat tail collagen type
I (BD, Biosciences, San Jose, CA) and recombinant
gC1q prepared as extensively described by us [12] were
diluted in PBS at the final concentration of 10 μg/ml and
incubated on plastic dishes overnight at 4 C. Polylysine
(Sigma-Aldrich, Inc., Milan, Italy) used as control was
used at the same concentration.

Construction of a cytoplasmic tail deleted
α4 integrin chain
The cytoplasmic tail-deleted α4 chain mutant R974
was generated by introducing a termination codon after
residue R974 into che cDNA by PCR. The full-length
α4 integrin chain cloned into the Bluescript vector was
used for amplification of the 1-974 region of the α4
integrin chain (α4 forward: 5’ggctcgagccatggcttgggaag
cgaggcgccg3’, including a XhoI restriction site followed
by a “kozak” consensus sequence at the 5’-end, and α4
reverseTM 5’ggctggcttctttaaaagataatctagagg3’ including
a XbaI and XhoI restriction sites) and then subcloned
in the pcDNA 3.1 vector (Invitrogen). A clone carrying
the insert was sequenced and used in the subsequent
experiments. The vectors were transfected into HT29 and
SW480 cells using FuGENE HD Transfection Reagent
(Promega, Madison, WI) following the manufaturer’s
protocol. To confirm successful transfection, cell extracts
of α4-transfected cells were analyzed by Western Blot
analysis using anti N- and anti C-terminal integrin α4
antibodies. To perform experiments with cells uniformly
expressing the α4 integrin chain, (more than 95%
positive cells), cells were sorted twice by flow cytometry
under sterile conditions in a FACS Canto (Becton
Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ) using a specific antibody
(PE anti-human CD49d; BioLegend, Pacific Heights, San
Diego, CA).

Protein extraction and immunoblotting
Cells were starved in DMEM without FCS and then
harvested by trypsinization and incubated in complete
medium for 1h at 37°C to allow the re-expression of the
membrane integrins. Cells were then washed in DMEM
without FCS, resuspended in DMEM and plated for
24h on dishes previously coated with collagen type I or
gC1q or polylysine as control. In some experiments cells
were treated with 28 μM salirasib (Cayman Chemical
Company, Cayman) in DMSO. After the desired time,
the cells were lysed in 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mM
NaCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 10% glycerol, 0.1% NP40, 50 mM
NaF, 1 mM Na3VO4, 1 mM EDTA, 50 mM DTT, 25X
Complete Protease Inhibitor Cocktail (Roche, Basilea,
Switzerland) buffer on ice for 30 minutes. The samples
were then centrifuged (13,000 x g for 30 minutes at 4°C).
The isolated proteins of the supernatant were quantified
using the Biorad Protein Assay (Biorad, Hercules,
California USA). Total cell lysates were separated on
precasted 4-20% gels (Biorad), followed by Western Blot
(GE Healthcare, Little Chalfont, UK) incubated for 1h
at room temperature in Tris-HCl and Tween 20 (50 mM
Tris-HCl, 150 mM NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20, pH 7.5) and 5%
Non-fat Dry Milk (Biorad). The antibodies used according
to the protocols supplied by the manufacturer’s were

was washed in cold PBS and incubated under shaking for
2h at 4°C with total bacterial proteins to allow Raf-RBD
conjugation with the resin. The resin was then washed
and incubated with cell lysates under shaking for 1h at
4°C. At the end of the incubation, loading buffer (0.25 M
Tris-HCl pH 6.8, 10% SDS, 0.5 M dithiothreitol (DTT),

described [37]. Cells were labeled with the vital
fluorochrome calcein AM (Invitrogen) for 15 min at 37°C
and then aliquoted into the bottom CAFCA (Centrifugal
Assay for Fluorescence-based Cell Adhesion) miniplates
at a density of 2.0 to 5.0 x 105 cells/ml. CAFCA miniplates
were centrifuged at 1,000 rpm for 5 min at 37°C to
synchronize the contact of the cells with the substrate.
The miniplates were then incubated for 20 min at 37°C
and subsequently centrifuged at 500 rpm. The relative
number of cells bound to the substrate (i.e. remaining in
the wells of the bottom miniplates) was estimated by top/
bottom fluorescence detection in a computer-interfaced
InfiniteM1000 PRO miniplate reader (TECAN Group
LTD, Mannedorf, CH).

Soft agar colony formation assay
For the bottom layer 2 ml of 0.6% agar (Sigma)
dissolved in PBS and diluted in DMEM with or without
10 μg/ml gC1q were allowed to polymerize on 6 well
plates. For the top layer 2 ml 0.4% agar dissolved in PBS
and diluted in DMEM with or without 10 μg/ml gC1q
were allowed to polymerize. 28 μM salirasib in DMSO or
DMSO used as negative control was added to both agar
solutions before polimerization. Before mixing with the
top agar layer, 5.0 x 104 HT29 cells transfected with the
wild type or the deleted mutant α4 integrin chain were
resuspended in DMEM containing 10% FCS and mixed
with the top agar solution. Cells were allowed to grow for
12 days.

Statistical methods
Plotted values are shown as means ± standard
deviation. Statistical significance of the results was
determined by using the two-tailed unpaired Student’s t
test to determine whether two datasets were significantly
different. A value of P < 0.05 was considered significant.

Proliferation assays
To quantitatively monitor cell behavior in real time,
we adopted the xCELLigence technology provided by the
Real-Time Cell Analyzer dual plate instrument (Roche)
[36]. The cell index, an arbitrary measurement and a
reflection of overall cell number, attachment quality, and
cell morphology can change as a function of time. For
proliferation assays, the E-Plates 96 (Roche) were coated
with EMILIN1, gC1q or collagen type I (20 μg/ml) (4°C,
overnight). Cells were then seeded at 5 x 103 cells/well
in 10% FCS-containing medium. Cells were monitored
every hour for 48 hours. Data analysis was performed
using Real-Time Cell Analyzer software (version 1.2)
supplied with the instrument. Experiments were performed
in triplicate.

FUNDING
This study was supported by AIRC (IG 14192) and
Ministry of Health (RF-2010-2309719) grants to PS and
AIRC (IG-13126) grant to AC.

Determination of the cytoplasmic Ca2+ levels
HaCat cells were starved in DMEM without FCS
and then harvested by trypsinization and incubated in
complete medium for 1 hour at 37°C. Cells were then
washed in DMEM without FCS, resuspended in DMEM
and plated for 24 hours on a 96 well plate previously
coated with gC1q or polylysine in the presence or in the
absence of DMSO. The following day, the cells were
loaded with 5 mM Fluo-4 AM (Invitrogen) in DMSO
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Fluorescence
intensity of the time lapse images was acquired every 45
min during a period of 6 hours using the AF6000 LX
workstation Leica.
