Abstract
Systemic chemotherapy generally has been considered immunosuppressive, but it has become evident that certain chemotherapeutic drugs elicit immunogenic danger signals in dying cancer
cells that can incite protective antitumor immunity. In this study,
we investigated whether locoregionally applied therapies, such as
melphalan, used in limb perfusion for melanoma (Mel-ILP)
produce related immunogenic effects. In human melanoma
biopsies, Mel-ILP treatment upregulated IL1B, IL8, and IL6 associated with their release in patients' locoregional sera. Although
induction of apoptosis in melanoma cells by melphalan in vitro
did not elicit threshold levels of endoplasmic reticulum and

reactive oxygen species stress associated with danger signals,
such as induction of cell-surface calreticulin, prophylactic
immunization and T-cell depletion experiments showed that
melphalan administration in vivo could stimulate a CD8þ T
cell–dependent protective antitumor response. Interestingly,
the vaccination effect was potentiated in combination with
exogenous calreticulin, but not tumor necrosis factor, a cytokine often combined with Mel-ILP. Our results illustrate how
melphalan triggers inﬂammatory cell death that can be leveraged by immunomodulators such as the danger signal calreticulin. Cancer Res; 75(8); 1603–14. 2015 AACR.

Introduction

an aggressive cancer that typiﬁes the paradox of being highly
antigenic while simultaneously exerting potent immunosuppression (3). Moreover, melanoma has recently gained wide attention
from an immunotherapeutic standpoint owing to promising
clinical effects of immune-checkpoint inhibitory drugs (4). All
this clearly advocates the need to further study the antimelanoma
immune responses, and reveal additional strategies capable of
augmenting antimelanoma immunity.
In recent years, many anticancer modalities have been shown to
positively regulate immune-effector functions and induce antitumor immunity (5). These include (i) strategies improving the
natural killer (NK) cells'/dendritic cells' (DC)/T cells' anticancer
activity, (ii) immunogenicity of the dying cancer cells, and (iii)
"resetting" microenvironment's immunocontexture (6). The
abovementioned processes are strongly inﬂuenced by certain
immune-effector cytokines exhibiting strong clinical prognostic
impact (7). Moreover, immunogenicity as well as vaccination
potential has been recently linked, at least in part, to "danger
signaling" operating on the cancer cell-level (8). Induction of
danger signaling mediates the spatiotemporally deﬁned "emission" of speciﬁc "eat me" signals/damage-associated molecular
patterns (DAMP) by the dying cancer cells, for example, surface
exposed (ecto-) calreticulin (CRT; ref. 9) and heat-shock proteins
(HSP)-70/90 (10), and secreted nucleotides, such as adenosine
triphosphate (ATP; refs. 1, 11). Danger signaling-potentiating
therapies have been recently shown to associate with favorable
clinical outcome in cancer patients (5, 12, 13). Moreover, it has
been proposed that, combinatorial therapy with exogenously
supplied danger signals could hold great immunogenicity-promoting potential (14).

Evidence indicates that anticancer therapies capable of harnessing the host's immune system while inducing cancer cell death
hold the highest therapeutic value (1, 2). Such therapies are of
immediate importance for antimelanoma therapy. Melanoma is

Most of the chemotherapeutics tested so far as DAMPs
inducers are primarily used as systemic chemotherapeutics
(15, 16) while physicochemical modalities (such as radiotherapy/Hyp-PDT) are primarily used as locoregional therapeutics
(17–19). Considering that immune responses following locoregional therapy can differ from those after systemic therapy
(20), it is necessary that anticancer immunity, danger signaling,
and immune-effector function–potentiating effects of locoregionally applied chemotherapeutics are also evaluated—a
knowledge that is largely missing and could have translational
signiﬁcance (20, 21).
To this end, we studied the effects of melphalan (Mel), the
regionally applied (standard-of-care) chemotherapeutic for
extremities-associated melanoma (20, 22). Melphalan is an alkylating agent, used in the isolated limb perfusion (ILP)/infusion
(ILI) therapy (20, 22), for patients harboring limb-localized
malignancies (23). Melphalan-based ILP/ILI (Mel-ILP/Mel-ILI)
is considerably effective, with a signiﬁcant fraction of patients
(25%–53%) displaying complete clinical responses and various
others showing partial responses (14%–39%; ref. 22; clinical
metadata analysis; Supplementary Table S1). Hitherto, melanoma cell-killing efﬁcacy is postulated as the sole contributor to
patients' responsiveness toward melphalan treatment (24). However, whether the promising antimelanoma efﬁcacy of melphalan
therapy is associated with antitumor immunity remains unexplored. Thus, owing to these conjectures and a gap-in-knowledge
about regional chemotherapeutics, we studied the mechanisms of
melphalan-induced melanoma cell death, the inﬂammatory contexture as well as the efﬁcacy of melphalan-induced induced
antitumor immunity/immune-effector function against melanoma. We also studied certain putative immunomodulatory factors
that are usable as combinatorial treatment for augmenting antimelanoma immunity.

Materials and Methods
Materials and reagents
The following drugs were used: melphalan (Sigma; M2011),
thapsigargin (Enzo Life Sciences; BML-PE180-0001). Hypericin
was prepared, puriﬁed, and stored as described previously (25).
Antibodies against the following proteins were used: BiP/GRP78
(Cell Signaling Technology; 3183), P-eIF2a (Cell Signaling Technology; 3597), eIF2a (Cell Signaling Technology; 21035), MICA/
B (Acris; AM26694AFN), actin (Sigma; A5441), CRT (anti-CRT;
Abcam; Ab92516), ULBP2 (Abcam; Ab88645), HSP90 (Stressgen;
ADI-SPA-830), and HSP70 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology; SC-24).
The following secondary antibodies were used: goat anti-mouseDyLight680 (Thermo Scientiﬁc; 35519), goat anti-rabbitDyLight800 (Thermo Scientiﬁc; 35571), goat anti-mouse-Alexa
Fluor 647 (Invitrogen; A21235), and goat anti-rabbit-Alexa Fluor
647 (Invitrogen; A21244). Western blot detection was done on
Odyssey.
Cell culture and treatments
All cells were cultured in DMEM (D6546; Sigma) with 2 mmol/L
glutamine, penicillin–streptomycin (P0781; Sigma) and 10% fetal
bovine serum (FBS) at 37 C under 5% CO2. A375 cells were
obtained from the ATCC and authenticated through DNA short
tandem repeat (STR) proﬁling. A375/K1735/MM031/B78 cells
were incubated with melphalan (300 mmol/L or 600 mmol/L
for B78) or brefeldin A (50 ng/mL for B78 cells) for the indicated

1604 Cancer Res; 75(8) April 15, 2015

times. For Hypericin-based photodynamic therapy (Hyp-PDT)
conditions, A375 cells were incubated for 16 hours with
150 nmol/L Hypericin, whereas B78 were incubated for 2 hours
with 500 nmol/L Hypericin in media without FBS, followed
by removal of Hypericin, irradiation (2.70 J/cm2), and were
cultured for indicated times.
Measurement of ecto-CRT, ecto-HSP70, and ecto-HSP90
After treatment, cells were collected with TrypLE Express (Life
Technologies; 12604-021), washed with PBS and with FC (Flow
Cytometry) buffer (2% FBS, 1% BSA in PBS), incubated for 1 hour
at 4 C with primary antibodies, washed, and incubated for 1 hour
at 4 C with secondary antibodies. After ﬁnal washes, cells were
incubated in FC buffer including 1 mmol/L Sytox Green (Life
Technologies; S7020) for 15 minutes and analyzed on Attune
Flow Cytometer (Life Technologies). The permeabilized cells
were excluded from the analysis due to intracellular staining, and
the fold changes in the mean ﬂuorescence intensity (MFI) for
each DAMP were analyzed.
DC-maturation analysis
Human and murine immature DCs (iDC) were prepared
according to previously described protocols (26, 27). The
protocol for coincubation of cancer cells with iDCs has been
previously described (28, 29). Brieﬂy, the DCs were cocultured
with untreated or dying cancer cells (24-hour time point) at a
1:20 (DCs:cancer cells) ratio for 24 hours under standard
culture conditions. In some experiments, cancer cells were
preincubated with blocking antibodies (1.25 mg/106 cells): IgY
(Promega, G116A), anti-HSP90 (Novus Bio; NB120-19104;
antibodies were present in the coculture media as well), coated
with recombinant CRT (rCRT; Abcam; ab15729; cells were
incubated with rCRT at 4 C for 30 minutes followed by removal of unbound protein) as described before (9) or in the
presence of 100 ng/mL soluble recombinant TNF (rTNF;
human: PeproTech, 300-01A; murine: PeproTech; 315-01A).
For staining of human DCs, the following antibodies were
used: anti-HLA-DR antibody (BD; MHLDR01) and anti-CD86
(BD; MHCD8605). For staining of murine DCs, the following
antibodies were used: anti-MHC II antibody (eBioscience; 115321-81) and anti-CD86 (eBioscience; 17-0862-81).
T-cell proliferation
The protocol for triple culture of cancer cells, DCs, and T cells
(1:1:50 ratio, respectively) has been previously described (29).
Brieﬂy, the untreated or dying cancer cells (24-hour time point)
were cocultured with iDCs for 24 hours. Allogeneic T cells
(CD3þ), isolated from donors' blood according to the manufacturer's recommendations (Pan T Cell Isolation Kit II; Miltenyi Biotec; 130-095-130), labeled with eFluor 670 Proliferation
Dye (eBioscience; 65-0840-85), were added to the cocultures
for an additional period of 5 days. Human IL2 was added at day
2 of the triple cocultures (25 U/mL). At the end of day 5, cells
were stained for CD3, CD4, and CD8 [with antibodies antiCD3-eFluor450 (48-0038), anti-CD4-FITC (11-0049), and
anti-CD8-PE-Cy7 (25-0049); all from eBioscience]. Dead cells
were excluded using the Fixable Live/Dead Yellow stain according to the manufacturer's speciﬁcations (Invitrogen; L34959).
Data acquisition was performed on Gallios ﬂow cytometer
(Beckman Coulter) and the Kaluza software (Beckman Coulter)
was used for data analysis.

Melphalan, Antimelanoma Immunity, Inﬂammation

Prophylactic mouse vaccination
Mouse experiments were performed in the animal facilities of
Warsaw Medical University (Warsaw, Poland) and KU Leuven
(Leuven, Belgium), according to the guidelines of the ethical
committees of these universities. The prophylactic mice vaccination was performed according to the previously described protocol (29). Brieﬂy, the mice were injected subcutaneously with 100
mL containing 500  103 dying B78 cells (40% of apoptotic cells;
in indicated experiments, the cells were coated with blocking
antibodies or rCRT, as described above) or coinjected with murine
rTNF, or with 100 mL of PBS into the left ﬂank. After 10 days, mice
were rechallenged with untreated B78 cells into the right ﬂank
(50  103 cells in 100 mL PBS) and tumor growth was monitored
for the next 40 days. Depletion of CD4þ or CD8þ T cells was
performed according to the previously described protocol (30).
To evaluate the elimination of T cells, blood was collected via
cheek pouch and the presence of CD4þ or CD8þ T cells was
detected through anti-CD4 (BD; 553047) and anti-CD8 (BD; cat.
no., 553031) staining, as described previously (30).
Statistical analysis
Data are presented as exact values, percentages of cell population
or fold changes, speciﬁcally as indicated on each ﬁgure. Error bars
represent SEM. Depending on the type of experiments, as a statistical analysis we performed the Student t test, one-way ANOVA with
the Dunnett post-test or two-way ANOVA with the Bonferroni posttest, as indicated in the ﬁgure legends. Fold expressions of cytokines
in patients' samples were analyzed for signiﬁcance using either the
two-tailed one sample t test (if results had Gaussian distribution) or
the two-tailed Wilcoxon rank-sum test (if results did not have
Gaussian distribution). Always  represents P < 0.05;  represents
P < 0.01; and  represents P < 0.001.

Results
Mel-ILP evokes proinﬂammatory immune-effector cytokines
production
A previous microarray/qRT-PCR analysis conﬁrmed a signiﬁcant increase in IL6 levels, post-Mel-ILP in patients' biopsies (31);
this inspired us to further investigate whether clinical melphalan
treatment is associated with induction of certain other major
cytokines. We ﬁrst extended previous expression analysis (31)
to speciﬁc immune-effector cytokines in the tumor bed. Beyond
IL6 potentiation (31), we found signiﬁcant increase in levels of
IL1B and IL8 in the absence of signiﬁcant changes in IL10, TNF,
and IFNG levels, in tumor samples taken 1 hour after Mel-ILP
(Fig. 1A).
Next, considering that Mel-ILP is a locoregionally applied
therapy, we wondered to what extent the Mel-ILP–induced cytokine transcript pattern present in the tumor bed was mirrored by
the locoregional plasma-associated cytokine pattern on the protein level. As early as 1 hour after Mel-ILP treatment, protein levels
of IL6 and, to a lesser extent, IL1b increased signiﬁcantly, while we
failed to detect any signiﬁcant increase in the levels of IL12p70,
IL8, TNF, IL10 (Fig. 1B and Supplementary Fig. S1A), and IFNg
(data not shown). Thus, the locoregional serum-associated cytokine pattern largely mirrored the tumor bed–associated transcript
pattern. Considering that samples were collected very early (10–
30 minutes/1 hour) after Mel-ILP, we suspected that freshly
tumor-inﬁltrating immune cells would not substantially contribute to the observed cytokine production. In line with this, we

www.aacrjournals.org

failed to detect increased immune cells' inﬁltration following MelILP (1 hour) after staining tumor sections for CD68/CD3, speciﬁc
markers of monocytes/macrophages, and T lymphocytes, respectively (Supplementary Fig. S1B and S1C). This suggests that MelILP–triggered increase in immune-effectors/proinﬂammatory
cytokines is mostly the result of the alteration in preexisting
tumor microenvironment.
Melphalan-induced apoptosis in vitro is modulated by the
combination of ER stress and ROS
A previous study indicated that post-Mel-ILP, signatures of
endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress (i.e., ATF3, GADD45A, and
XBP1s) were induced in patients' biopsies (31). Considering that
ER stress is a crucial stress response for eliciting cell death, danger
signaling and cytokine production (32), we decided to investigate
the ER stress-cell death cross-talk after melphalan treatment.
We therefore studied the biochemical hallmarks of melphalaninduced melanoma cell death in vitro using human (A375) and
murine (B78) metastatic melanoma cell lines. Melphalan timedependently affected melanoma cell viability (Fig. 2A and Supplementary Fig. S2A) and induced phosphatidylserine exposure
(Fig. 2B and Supplementary Fig. S2B), loss of mitochondrial
transmembrane potential (Dcm; Fig. 2C and Supplementary Fig.
S2C), and signiﬁcant activation of caspase-3 (Fig. 2D and Supplementary Fig. S2D). Furthermore, the pan-caspase inhibitor
zVAD-fmk abolished caspase-3 activation (Fig. 2E and Supplementary Fig. S2E) and resulted in a protection from cell death (Fig.
2F and Supplementary Fig. S2F), thus indicating that melphalan
induces apoptosis.
We next investigated whether melphalan induced ER stress by
evaluating markers of the unfolded protein response (UPR). Melphalan-treated melanoma cells showed an increase in BiP/GRP78
content, a clear induction of eIF2a phosphorylation (Fig. 2G and
Supplementary Fig. S2G) and of the spliced form of XBP1 (Fig. 2H
and Supplementary Fig. S2H), indicating the ability of melphalan
to activate the PERK and IRE1a arms of the UPR. Addition of the
chemical chaperone, TUDCA, which has been reported to alleviate
ER stress (33), resulted in decreased levels of phospho-eIF2a (Fig.
2I) and a partial protection from melphalan-induced cell death
(Fig. 2J). This suggests that although ER stress contributes to the
induction of apoptotic cell death after melphalan treatment, other
signaling events are required to incite apoptosis.
The presence of ER stress along with reactive oxygen species
(ROS) induction and caspase signaling has been shown to provide
the biochemical prerequisite for efﬁcient danger signaling
(9, 15, 28). Indeed, as reported previously (34), melphalan caused
a signiﬁcant increase in the intracellular levels of ROS in melanoma cells (Fig. 2K). Attenuation of ROS signaling by the antioxidant N-acetylcysteine (NAC), neither signiﬁcantly protected
melanoma cells from melphalan-induced apoptosis (Fig. 2L), nor
it affected the activation of ER stress (data not shown). In contrast,
the combination of TUDCA and NAC signiﬁcantly blunted melphalan-induced melanoma apoptosis (Fig. 2M).
These results underscore that ROS production and ER stress act
in concert to induce apoptosis in melanoma cells in response to
melphalan.
Melphalan-induced apoptosis is associated with a deﬁned ER
stress and ROS-dependent danger signaling
Melphalan treatment in vitro is able to induce ER stress and
ROS—two most important apical prerequisites for danger

signaling elicitation (28, 35) by apoptotically dying cells. To
evaluate whether melphalan treatment induces danger signaling
in melanoma cells and to reveal its molecular nature, we analyzed
a panel of well-established DAMPs and/or "eat me" signals (9,
10, 28, 36).
First, we measured CRT, HSP70, and HSP90 on the cell surface
(ecto-CRT, ecto-HSP70, and ecto-HSP90) of nonpermeabilized
dying melanoma cells, and the secretion of ATP. The effects
induced by melphalan in A375 cells were compared with HypPDT, a previously characterized danger signaling-inducing therapy (28, 29, 37), which caused fast preapoptotic ecto-CRT and
ecto-HSP90, followed by HSP70 surface exposure (Fig. 3A). In
contrast, melphalan-induced melanoma apoptosis was accompanied only by a signiﬁcant ecto-HSP90 after 24 hours (Fig. 3A), a
result that was conﬁrmed in the murine B78 and K1735 cells plus
in the human MM031 short-culture melanoma cells (Supplementary Fig. S3A–S3C). Interestingly, melphalan treatment did not
induce ATP secretion (Supplementary Fig. S3D and S3E). Of note,
melphalan-induced ecto-HSP90 was detected only when the
whole population of dying cells entered late-apoptotic stage
(according to kinetics of caspase-3 activity; compare Fig. 3A
and Fig. 2D). However, the population of ecto-HSP90þ cells was
partially AnV/7AAD and AnVþ/7AAD (preapoptotic or early/
mid-apoptotic cells; Fig. 3B), while the small population of ectoCRTþ cells was mostly AnVþ/7AAD (early/mid-apoptotic cells;
Supplementary Fig. S3F). Thus, contrary to Hyp-PDT, melphalan
induced pre- or early/mid-apoptotic ecto-HSP90 in a predominantly late/postapoptotic cell culture environment.

1606 Cancer Res; 75(8) April 15, 2015

Because DAMPs emission has been shown to predominantly
rely on ER stress-ROS signaling, and in some cases require caspase
signaling (28), we decided to block these apoptotic mediators.
Blocking caspases by zVAD-fmk blunted melphalan-induced
ecto-HSP90 (Fig. 3C and Supplementary Fig. S3G), whereas
attenuation of melphalan-induced ER stress by TUDCA (Fig.
3D), or ROS production by NAC (Fig. 3E) exerted a dose-dependent decrease in ecto-HSP90. Consistent with the effects of zVADfmk and the kinetics of DAMP exposure, the combination of
TUDCA and NAC suppressed ecto-HSP90 (Fig. 3F), thereby
strongly coupling cell death signaling reliant on ER stress and
ROS with the mobilization of HSP90 at the plasma membrane.
Despite inducing ROS and some features of ER stress, melphalan did not increase ecto-CRT. Because in previous studies induction of robust ER stress, by thapsigargin and tunicamycin, restored
ecto-CRT after cisplatin treatment (38), we tested whether augmenting ER stress in melphalan-treated cells would elicit ectoCRT. To this end, we used various ER stress–inducing agents:
sarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca2þ-ATPase (SERCA) pump
inhibitor thapsigargin, the inhibitor of N-glycosylation tunicamycin, the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib, the glycolytic inhibitor 2-deoxy-D-glucose (2DG), and the reducing agent dithiothreitol (DTT). Intriguingly, only the addition of high-dose thapsigargin, but not other aforementioned ER stress inducers,
restored ecto-CRT after melphalan treatment (Fig. 3G and
Supplementary Fig. S3H). This effect could be dissociated from
an increased induction of cell death (Supplementary Fig. S2I)
because none of these agents enhanced melanoma killing when

thapsigargin-induced ecto-CRT (Fig. 3I), and did not exacerbate
cell death (Supplementary Fig. S2J). Notably, addition of either
ER stress inducers and/or H2O2 to melphalan-treated cells
did not affect ecto-HSP90 (Fig. 3H and J and Supplementary
Fig. S3I).
In aggregate, these observations conﬁrm that while ROS and ER
stress are crucial for ecto-CRT and ecto-HSP90, the lack of a robust
ER stress module compromises the ecto-CRT–trafﬁcking mechanisms in melphalan-treated cells.
Melphalan-induced apoptosis is associated with the secretion
of proinﬂammatory chemokines
To determine whether melphalan treatment is additionally
able to affect key cytokine or chemokine signaling in melanoma
cells, we analyzed the supernatants of melphalan-treated A375
cells for the presence of key proinﬂammatory cytokines (IFNa,
CXCL8/IL8, IL6, and TNF), or chemokines (CCL2, CCL5,
CXCL9, and CXCL10; refs. 39, 40). A375 cells failed to release
CCL5, CXCL9, CXCL10, IL6, and TNF under basal conditions
(data not shown). However, while neither melphalan- nor HypPDT treatments statistically inﬂuenced IFNa release, the release
of IL8 and CCL2 by A375 cells 24 hours after melphalan
treatment (Fig. 3H) was signiﬁcantly increased. This increase
in IL8 and CCL2 was unique for melphalan because Hyp-PDT
induced no CCL2 increase and induced even a signiﬁcant
decrease in IL8 (Fig. 3K).
Thus melphalan-induced apoptotic cell death of melanoma
cells in vitro is associated with the induction of ecto-HSP90, as well
as the secretion of proinﬂammatory chemokines, IL8 and CCL2.
Melphalan-treated cancer cells evoke moderate activation of
DCs that is not reliant on ecto-HSP90 or ecto-CRT
Having established that melphalan treatment induces signature
of danger signaling in melanoma cells in vitro (Figs. 2 and 3) and a
shift toward a proinﬂammatory tumor microenvironment
(Fig. 1), we wondered about the direct interactions of such treated
melanoma cells with key immune cells.
To this end, we cocultured melphalan treated melanoma cells
with iDCs and measured the phenotypic maturation (i.e.,
increased surface expression of HLA-DR and CD86) and functional stimulation of DCs. In our experimental setting, LPS
treatment of iDCs (Supplementary Fig. S4A and S4B) was applied
as a positive control to test the maturation potency of iDCs,
whereas Hyp-PDT–treated cells served as a control for the stimulation of fully mature DCs (28, 29). Melphalan-treated melanoma cells induced signiﬁcant DC-maturation, similarly to HypPDT (fold changes: Fig. 4A; percentage changes: Supplementary
Fig. S4C). To establish the relevance of ecto-HSP90 for the
melphalan-treated cells-induced DC-maturation, we blocked
ecto-HSP90 with a HSP90-speciﬁc antibody. Despite the suggestive trend of decreased phenotypic maturation with ecto-HSP90
elimination (Fig. 4B), no statistical signiﬁcance was obtained. We

then wondered whether the immunostimulatory effects of melphalan-treated human melanoma cells on DCs could be increased
by coating of the dying melanoma cells with exogenous rCRT.
However, addition of rCRT to melphalan-treated human melanoma cells did not alter phenotypic maturation of cocultured DCs
(Fig. 4C). We reasoned that the proinﬂammatory cytokine TNF
could be a possible additional candidate. This choice was motivated by our retrospective metadata analysis of reported clinical
data illustrating that the combination of melphalan with TNF or
TNF/IFNg (Supplementary Table S2) improves patients' tendency
to achieve complete clinical responses within ILP/ILI therapies
(Supplementary Fig. S4H). Although high doses of TNF and IFNg
given during ILP/ILI are known to be associated with vasodisruption and increased uptake of melphalan in tumors (which
potentiates melphalan's cytotoxicity; ref. 41), yet their immunologic impact cannot be ruled out. However, addition of rTNF to
melphalan-treated human melanoma cells did not increase phenotypic maturation of cocultured DCs (Fig. 4C), thus suggesting
that to improve the interface between melphalan-treated cells and
DCs, other factors are required.
We also quantiﬁed the levels of IL1b, IL12p70, IL6, TNF, and
IL10 in the cancer cell–DC coculture. Only Hyp-PDT–treated A375
cells stimulated a signiﬁcant release of IL8, IL6, TNF, and increased
IL1b secretion by human DCs (Fig. 4D). The melphalan-treated
melanoma cells stimulated a signiﬁcant release of IL8 by DCs and
increased secretion of IL1b and IL6 to not signiﬁcant levels; however, it did not provoke the release of the immunosuppressive
cytokine IL10. These data point to the formation of semi-mature
DCs (42) (CD86highHLA-DRhighIL8highIL1blowIL6low) after coculture with melphalan-treated human melanoma cells.
We also wondered whether melphalan-treated cancer cells
could affect the activation status of NK cells, as these immune
cells contribute to the direct elimination of cancer cells. In vitro
coculture of melphalan-treated A375 cells with peripheral blood–
isolated NKs neither increased the surface levels of NK activating
(NKp30, NKp46, and CD69) nor inhibitory (CD94) receptors
as compared with untreated cancer cells (Supplementary Fig.
S5A–S5D). The absence of IFNg (and other important chemokines and cytokines) further conﬁrmed the lack of activation of
NK cells (Supplementary Fig. S5E). We next measured the levels of
cancer cell–associated surface molecules that are recognized by
NKs, that is, MICA/B and ULBP2, before and after the treatment. In
comparison with the untreated A375 cells (Supplementary Fig.
S5F), the melphalan-treated cancer cells did not show any change
in the levels of MICA/B and ULBP2 (Supplementary Fig. S5G).
This observation could explain why dying cancer cells could not
stimulate NK cells in vitro.

investigated their T-cell activation capacity in vitro. For this purpose, after 24-hour coculture of human iDCs with the dying
cancer cells, T cells were added to the cell mixture and the rate
of T-cell proliferation and IFNg production were measured as
read-outs for T-cell activation (Fig. 4E–G). Melphalan-treated
melanoma cells, similar to Hyp-PDT–treated cells, stimulated
proliferation of CD4þ and CD8þ T cells. This was paralleled by
an increased production of IFNg into the supernatant of the
cocultures (as compared with T cells alone), although the melphalan-treated A375-mediated IFNg release by T cells was lower
than that induced by Hyp-PDT–treated cancer cells (Fig. 4G). We
also investigated whether antibody-based blockade of ectoHSP90 or ectopic addition of rCRT or rTNF affects T-cell proliferation in vitro. Consistent with the DC-maturation results, neither

elimination of ecto-HSP90, nor addition of rCRT or rTNF,
improved T-cell activation mediated by the melphalan-treated
melanoma cells (Supplementary Fig. S4F and S4G).
Thus, DCs cocultured with melphalan-treated melanoma
cells trigger increased (danger signals-independent) proliferation of CD4þ/CD8þ T cells in the presence of moderate IFNg
production. These results further substantiate the earlier conclusion that melphalan-treated melanoma cells induce semimature DCs.

anticancer response, we tested its immunization potential using a
prophylactic vaccination mice model.
We used the murine B78 melanoma cells that upon melphalan
treatment died apoptotically and displayed caspase-dependent
ecto-HSP90 (Supplementary Figs. S2 and S3A), induced semimature DCs (Fig. 5A and B), which was unaffected by ecto-HSP90
antibody-based blockage, coating with rCRT or addition of rTNF
(Fig. 5C and D). We thus vaccinated C57BL/6 mice with melphalan-treated B78 cells or PBS (placebo control), followed (10
days later) by a rechallenge with live B78 cells and tumor growth
monitoring. As a negative control, we used a tolerogenic cell
death-inducer, brefeldin A (28, 43) and compared the vaccination
efﬁcacy of melphalan-treated cells with that elicited by the immu-

nogenic cell death (ICD) inducer, Hyp-PDT (44). Interestingly,
melphalan-treated cancer cells exhibited the ability to induce an
"anticancer vaccination effect"—as many as 40% of the mice
vaccinated with melphalan-treated cells rejected rechallenge with
live tumor cells (Fig. 5D). This effect was considerably better than
the "vaccine" produced with brefeldin A (Fig. 5D), but not as
robust as the Hyp-PDT–based vaccine, which protected 62% of
the mice from tumor formation following rechallenge (Fig. 5D).
To establish whether the protective anticancer effect induced by
melphalan-treated cancer cells is due to the stimulation of an
adaptive immune response, we depleted immunocompetent
mice of CD4þ or CD8þ T cells (antibody-based depletion; as
control, antibody against b-galactosidase was used; depletion

results are presented on Supplementary Fig. S6B and S6C).
Remarkably, elimination of CD8þ T cells resulted in abrogation
of the melphalan-induced anticancer vaccination effect, whereas
elimination of CD4þ T cells was ineffective (Fig. 5E). This observation conﬁrms that the vaccination potential of melphalantreated B78 cells is highly dependent on CD8þ T cells.
To analyze the relevance of melphalan-induced ecto-HSP90 in
deﬁning in vivo immunogenicity, we carried out prophylactic mice
vaccination using melphalan-treated melanoma cells coated with
control or with an HSP90-blocking antibody. This in vivo experiment indicated that the vaccination effect of the melphalantreated melanoma cells does not rely on ecto-HSP90 (Fig. 5F).
Furthermore, we wondered whether the immunogenic effect of
melphalan-treated murine melanoma cells could be potentiated
by combinatorial addition of rCRT or rTNF. Remarkably, coating
melphalan-treated cells with rCRT signiﬁcantly increased their
immunogenicity (Fig. 5G), while addition of rTNF did not signiﬁcantly increase the immunogenic properties of melphalantreated melanoma cells (Fig. 5G).
In conclusion, these in vivo studies show that melphalan-treated
murine melanoma cells are endowed with some tumor-rejecting
capacity—which is possibly linked to the induction of inﬂammatory cell death in melanoma associated with positive immuneeffector mechanisms; and which can be further potentiated in vivo
by combinatorial addition of rCRT.

Discussion
In this study, we thoroughly describe melphalan as inducer of
inﬂammatory cell death associated with immunogenicity in melanoma. We show that melphalan-treated melanoma cells favor
inﬂammatory or immune-effector mechanisms in immune cells
and/or tumor microenvironment. This notion is supported by the
spectra of different cytokines detected in Mel-ILP–treated patients'
samples and the observation that melphalan-treated melanoma
cells induce semi-mature DCs, which, in turn, induce moderate
activation of T cells. Importantly, melphalan-treated melanoma
cells elicit noticeable, CD8þ T cells–dependent "vaccine-like"
antitumor immunity. These positive immune-mediated anticancer effects can be further elevated by a combinatorial treatment
reconstituting ecto-CRT, an "eat me" signal, which is otherwise
poorly trafﬁcked to the plasma membrane after melphalan treatment of melanoma cells.
We show that melphalan treatment was fairly efﬁcient at
inducing ROS production and ER stress in melanoma cells, to
an extent that blocking these processes severely compromised
melphalan-induced cell death in vitro. Along with the induction of
an early ER stress signature in patients' biopsies following Mel-ILP
revealed in a previous microarray analysis (31) and the detectable
upregulation of IL6 and IL1b in the patients' sera as early as 1 hour
after Mel-ILP found in this study, these ﬁndings highlight the
ability of melphalan to rapidly tilt the balance toward a more
proinﬂammatory tumor environment. Induction of ER stress and
ROS in a simultaneous or concomitant fashion is a prerequisite
for efﬁcient danger signaling apically associated with the preapoptotic surface exposure of ecto-CRT (8, 16). However, our study
conclusively shows that melphalan-induced ER stress was below
the threshold required to elicit ecto-CRT. Moreover, our data
underscore that combining melphalan treatment uniquely with
the SERCA inhibitor thapsigargin restored ecto-CRT in melphalan-treated cells. This outlines the importance of ER-Ca2þ release

1612 Cancer Res; 75(8) April 15, 2015

over other ER stress–inducing modalities in ecto-CRT induction or
restoration (of note, Hyp-PDT, a powerful enabler of preapoptotic
ecto-CRT and ICD, also induces SERCA-photodamage–based ERCa2þ release; ref. 45). Although, we did ﬁnd that melphalan is an
efﬁcient inducer of ecto-HSP90. Melphalan-induced ecto-HSP90
was mediated by caspase signaling secondary to ER stress and ROS
production—an interesting observation that deserves to be
further explored, considering that the signaling mechanisms
underlying ecto-HSP90 are elusive. However, our ex vivo/in vivo
observations rule out a major role for ecto-HSP90 as a danger
signal, thereby outlining that ecto-HSP90 is a more contextdependent DAMP rather than a general one, as suggested in
previous studies (46).
Prominently, on the immune-effectors front, the absence of
IL10 production following Mel-ILP in patients' samples and from
the DCs/NKs interacting with melphalan-treated cancer cells,
further indicates that melphalan does not actively promote an
immunosuppressive microenvironment. The melphalan-induced
inﬂammatory/immune-effector mechanisms revealed here might
have important prognostic implications for melanoma, considering that the immunomodulatory features induced by melphalan, that is, high expression of HLA-DR, increased T-cell activation/IFNg production, and low presence of IL10, are also positive
prognostic factors for malignant melanoma (7). Moreover,
increased IL6 production (another factor potentiated by melphalan) was reported to associate with increased sensitivity toward
immunotherapy against melanoma (47). Unfortunately, due to
the low number of patients (with limited clinical follow-up)
available for this study (Supplementary Table S3), we could not
obtain an objective predictive or prognostic estimation for melphalan-induced cytokines—a problem that should be addressed
in the future.
Nevertheless, our prophylactic immunization studies convincingly show that antitumor immunity may, at least partly, contribute to the Mel-ILP/ILI's therapeutic effect against melanoma.
Immunogenicity of melphalan-based vaccines was signiﬁcantly
better than the tolerogenic cell death inducer brefeldin A but not
as high as that of Hyp-PDT, a potent ICD inducer (28). This
suggests that certain immunogenicity-augmenting strategies
might be required to further increase the potential of melphalan-based therapy. Indeed, melphalan treatment setting lacked a
crucial "eat me" signal, that is, ecto-CRT and a crucial immuneeffector cytokine on the level of cancer cells/immune cells, known
to accentuate its therapeutic effect in the clinic, that is, TNF.
Addition of rCRT or rTNF in coculture assays of melphalan-treated
cells/DCs/T cells did not affect DC-maturation/T cells' proliferation. These results are in line with previous studies showing that at
least ecto-CRT does not directly modulate immune cell maturation (9). Remarkably, rCRT but not rTNF signiﬁcantly accentuated
the immunogenic potential of melphalan-treated melanoma
cells. This clearly shows that in the melphalan treatment set-up,
the combination of rCRT has a better (immuno)therapeutic
potential than rTNF.
In conclusion, our study provides a comprehensive outlook
(Fig. 5H) of the cell death and immunologic characteristics of
melphalan, a widely used locoregionally applied chemotherapeutic that, as demonstrated by systemic chemotherapeutics, is
necessary to enable the design of "smart" combinatorial immunotherapies (especially in case of melanoma). This advancement
is direly needed because 40% to 50% of primary melanoma
occurs on the extremities and around 85.5% of these patients

develop recurrences (48). Our in vivo results indicate that the
strategies aiming to potentiate the immunogenicity or danger
signaling associated with melphalan should strive to increase
ecto-CRT. This could be obtained, either via combination treatment with ER-Ca2þ release inducing ER stressors such as thapsigargin or thapsigargin analogs such as G202 [prodrug within
phase I clinical trial (49)] that could "intrinsically" restore ectoCRT; or via combination with exogenously supplied rCRT. The
Mel-ILP/ILI treatment schema represents an ideal opportunity for
the latter combination treatment, as just such as TNF, rCRT can
also be used in combination with melphalan for short-term
locoregional treatment in extremities-associated malignancies—
a conjecture that should be investigated urgently in the future.
