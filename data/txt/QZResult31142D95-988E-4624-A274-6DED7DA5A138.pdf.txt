ABSTRACT
Programmed cell death 4 (PDCD4) is a tumour suppressor implicated in cancer
development and progression and was recently identified as a repressor of capindependent translation of specific genes involved in the regulation of apoptosis.
We show that the RNA-binding protein HuR binds to the PDCD4 3’UTR to protect it
from miR-21-induced silencing. However, following H2O2 treatment, PDCD4 mRNA is
degraded via miR-21 binding. Importantly, we identify HuR as a novel substrate of the
ERK8 kinase pathway in response to H2O2 treatment. We show that phosphorylation of
HuR by ERK8 prevents it from binding to PDCD4 mRNA and allows miR-21-mediated
degradation of PDCD4.

INTRODUCTION

where it has been shown to either positively or negatively
regulate translation. For example, HuR binds to the 5’UTR
of IGF-IR and Bcl-xL to repress their translation [9, 10].
In contrast, binding of HuR enhances the IRES-mediated
translation of XIAP [8]. In addition, HuR has been
implicated in translational regulation through its ability
to impact microRNAs, although the precise mechanism
is not clear. In a competitive role, the binding of HuR
to the mRNA may prevent miR/RISC (RNA-induced
silencing complex) binding, thus resulting in stabilization
of the target mRNA and an increase in translation [11].
Conversely, HuR binding may result in conformational
changes in the mRNA that promote miR/RISC binding,
leading to mRNA degradation or translation inhibition
[11]. Given the diverse functions of HuR, it is no surprise
that it plays a major role in the initiation and progression
of cancer. This occurs mainly through its ability to regulate
the stability or translation of target mRNAs involved in
tumour growth, angiogenesis, invasion, and metastasis
[12].
Programmed cell death 4 (PDCD4) is a tumour
suppressor protein whose expression is increased
during apoptosis [13], and has been implicated in the

RNA binding proteins (RBPs) have many important
roles in the post-transcriptional control of RNAs including
splicing, stabilization, translation and localization of
multiple mRNA targets. Normally located in the nucleus,
RBPs can accumulate in the cytoplasm in response to
cellular stress to regulate specific mRNA targets, allowing
the cell to recover from stress or to undergo apoptosis.
HuR is a ubiquitously expressed RBP belonging to the
Hu/embryonic lethal abnormal vision (ELAV) protein
family [1]. HuR localizes primarily to the nucleus where
it is involved in regulating mRNA splicing [2], export [3],
and polyadenylation [4] via its three RNA recognition
motifs (RRMs). Notably, a hinge region between RRM2
and RRM3 contains a nucleocytoplasmic shuttling
domain that shuttles HuR into the cytoplasm in response
to cellular stressors such as UV, arsenite, and hydrogen
peroxide (H2O2) [5, 6]. The cytoplasmic accumulation of
HuR allows it to modulate mRNA stability and translation
[7-9]. HuR mainly functions by binding to AU-rich
elements (AREs) in the 3’ untranslated regions (UTRs) of
target mRNAs. However, HuR can also bind the 5’UTR,

development of lung, colon, liver, breast, and brain
cancers [14-18]. PDCD4 binds to and inhibits the
eukaryotic initiation factor (eIF) 4A, the main helicase
required for cap-dependent translation, suggesting a role
as a general inhibitor of translation [19, 20]. In addition,
PDCD4 was shown to inhibit the translation of several
specific mRNA targets such as p53 [21], XIAP and Bcl-xL
[22] through a cap-independent mechanism. We recently
demonstrated that the loss of PDCD4 in Glioblastoma
multiforme (GBM) tumours correlates with an increase
in Bcl-xL expression, and that re-expression of PDCD4
results in down-regulated Bcl-xL expression and increased
sensitivity to chemotherapeutics [18]. Determining the
mechanism of PDCD4 regulation is crucial to better
understand tumorigenesis. At the protein level, PDCD4
can be phosphorylated by S6 kinase 1 (S6K1) in response
to mitogens [23] or S6K2 in response to fibroblast growth
factor -2 (FGF-2) [22, 24], leading to its degradation.
PDCD4 is also regulated at the mRNA level by microRNA
(miR)-21, which is overexpressed in a variety of cancers
[25-27].
Here, we describe a novel observation where HuR
controls PDCD4 expression by regulating miR-21 binding
to PDCD4 mRNA. We show that reducing HuR levels
by siRNA results in a loss of PDCD4 that is mediated
through miR-21. We further demonstrate that treatment
of cells with H2O2 leads to the loss of PDCD4 that is
executed through miR-21. We show that treatment of cells
with H2O2 results in activation of Extracellular Signal
Regulated Kinase 8 (ERK8, Mitogen-Activated Protein
Kinase 15, MAPK15) and subsequent phosphorylation
of HuR by ERK-8. Once phosphorylated, HuR loses
its ability to bind the PDCD4 mRNA, thus making it
available for miR-21-mediated repression.

of HuR results in the loss of PDCD4 mRNA stability. In
order to identify if PDCD4 is a target mRNA that HuR
specifically binds to, we immunoprecipitated endogenous
HuR from HeLa cells and analyzed bound RNAs by qRTPCR. We were able to successfully immunoprecipitate
HuR (Figure 1D top panel) and isolation of bound RNAs
followed by qRT-PCR identified that PDCD4 mRNA is
enriched in HuR IP as compared to IgG control (Figure 1D
bottom panel). It is possible that this observed interaction
is indirect; therefore, we performed in vitro binding
experiments with purified recombinant GST-tagged HuR
and in vitro transcribed 32P-labelled PDCD4 3’UTR
to determine if HuR can directly bind to the PDCD4
UTR and observed dose-dependent binding of HuR to
the PDCD4 3’UTR (Figure 1E). These observations
demonstrate that HuR regulates PDCD4 mRNA stability
by directly binding to its 3’UTR.

HuR regulates PDCD4 mRNA stability via miR21
Recently, HuR has been implicated in regulating
some mRNAs through their miR binding sites [11].
Since PDCD4 is a known target of miR-21 [25], we
investigated the potential of HuR to regulate PDCD4
through miR-21. First, we confirmed that PDCD4 is
a target of miR-21 by transiently transfecting a miR21 mimic and observing a reduction in PDCD4 protein
(Figure 2A) and mRNA (Figure 2B) levels. To determine
if the effect of HuR knockdown on PDCD4 expression
is mediated through miR-21, we overexpressed an antimiR-21 (that binds to endogenous miR-21) to inhibit its
activity. HuR knockdown in combination with a nontargeting antimiR-control showed a decrease in PDCD4
expression. In contrast, this reduction was blocked when
cells were treated with the antimiR-21 (Figure 2C). This
data suggests that HuR prevents miR-21 from binding to
the PDCD4 mRNA resulting in protection of the mRNA
from degradation. One possible mechanism is that HuR
binds directly to the miR site on the 3’UTR thus blocking
the miR from binding directly [11, 28]. To determine
if HuR binds the miR-21 site on PDCD4 we generated
three ~200 nt fragments from the first 610 nucleotides
of the PDCD4 3’UTR (Figure 3A right panel). Fragment
S2 contains the miR-21 site highlighted in grey. We
performed UV cross-linking experiments with purified
GST-tagged HuR (Figure 3A left panel) and 32P-labelled
in vitro transcribed RNA probes. Interestingly, HuR did
not bind to the miR-21 containing fragment S2 (Figure
3B). Instead, HuR bound specifically to the first 200 nt S1
fragment. Moreover, HuR did not bind to the S3 fragment,
which further supports the specificity of the HuR-PDCD4
mRNA interaction. Since HuR does not seem to interact
with the miR-21 site, we were interested in determining if
binding to the S1 fragment could cause multimerization of

RESULTS
HuR controls PDCD4 protein expression by
regulating mRNA stability
To better understand the role of HuR in regulating
PDCD4, we transiently transfected HeLa cells with
small interfering (si) RNA against HuR and observed a
marked reduction in PDCD4 protein levels (Figure 1A).
Since HuR is known to bind to AU-rich elements (ARE)
in the 3’UTR regions of many mRNAs, and the 3’ UTR
of PDCD4 is AU-rich (http://utrdb.ba.itb.cnr.it/) we
measured the steady-state mRNA levels of PDCD4 after
HuR knockdown. Indeed, we observed a ~50% decrease
in PDCD4 mRNA (Figure 1B) as compared to control.
Additionally, we performed Actinomycin D experiments
after HuR knockdown and calculated the half-life of
PDCD4 mRNA as 11.6h in control cells and 9.5h after
HuR knockdown (Figure 1C) which suggests that a loss

HuR on the mRNA to possibly inhibit the binding of the
RISC complex. We performed RNA electromobility shift
assays (EMSA) with increasing concentrations of purified
GST-HuR and 32P-labelled S1-S2 fragment (Nucleotides
1-400; Figure 3C). We observed the formation of four
complexes with increasing concentrations of GST-HuR
suggesting that HuR binds to the first 200 nt of the
PDCD4 3’UTR, and further multimerizes on the RNA.
To further investigate the possible interplay between
miR-21, HuR and PCDC4 mRNA, we used differentially
labelled RNAs (Cy5.5-miR-21; 32P-PDCD4 3’ UTR) in
an RNA-EMSA. Interestingly, although HuR binds miR21 (Figure 3D) as observed by the Cy5.5 signal (bottom),
the presence of miR-21 does not impair HuR’s ability to
bind to and oligomerize on the PDCD4 RNA as observed

by autoradiography (top). Although the binding of miR21 to PDCD4 3’ UTR has been reported previously [25],
we were unable to detect binding of miR-21 to PDCD4
RNA due to the low sensitivity of the Cy5.5 label (data
not shown).

Loss of PDCD4 expression after H2O2 treatment is
mediated through miR-21 and ERK8

result in an accumulation of cytoplasmic HuR that is
usually mediated by phosphorylation of HuR [11]. This

Therefore, we were interested in determining the effect of
increased cytoplasmic HuR levels on PDCD4 expression.
We were expecting that an increase in cytoplasmic
HuR would provide a protective effect against miR-21dependent degradation, leading to increased PDCD4
expression. Contrary to our expectations, however,
treatment of cells with H2O2 resulted in a loss in PDCD4

expression both at the protein (Figure 4B) and mRNA
(Figure 4C) levels, even though HuR accumulated in the
cytoplasm as monitored by immunofluorescence (Figure
4A). Additionally, we tested the requirement of miR-21
for PDCD4 loss during H2O2 treatment as it was shown
previously that miR-21 levels increase following H2O2
treatment [29]. Cells were pretreated with antimiR-21
and then exposed to H2O2. Inhibition of miR-21 rescued

PDCD4 protein expression after H2O2 treatment (Figure
4D), suggesting that miR-21 binding is responsible for the
reduced PDCD4 expression in response to H2O2 stress.
This result suggests that it is not necessarily the increase in
cytoplasmic HuR that is important for PDCD4 regulation,
but rather, modifications of the cytoplasmic HuR after
H2O2 treatment that may affect its target binding. We
therefore performed the HuR immunoprecipitation after

H2O2 treatment and observed a loss of PDCD4 binding to
HuR after H2O2 exposure (Figure 4E). These observations
point toward a model where under normal growth
conditions, a small amount of HuR that is normally found
in the cytoplasm binds to the PDCD4 3’UTR and protects
it from miR-21 mediated degradation. However, under
oxidative stress, HuR is likely modified so that it can no
longer bind to PDCD4 mRNA, thus allowing miR-21 to

bind to the PDCD4 3’UTR leading to degradation of the
mRNA and loss of protein expression.
Previous reports have identified the activation of
the kinase ERK8 during H2O2 stress [30], thus we were
interested in determining if HuR is a potential target
of ERK8. We observed that PDCD4 protein levels are
rescued after H2O2 treatment when ERK8 levels are
reduced (Figure 5B), even though HuR still accumulates
in the cytoplasm (Figure 5A). This data suggests that
ERK8 may phosphorylate HuR to change its binding
affinity for PDCD4. We therefore performed an in vitro

kinase assay to determine if ERK8 can phosphorylate HuR
directly. Indeed, we observed that HA-ERK8 specifically
phosphorylates HuR, thus identifying HuR as a novel
substrate of the ERK8 signaling pathway (Figure 5C).
This data suggests a model where H2O2 causes activation
of ERK8, which subsequently phosphorylates HuR, thus
preventing it from binding to the PDCD4 3’UTR and
rendering the PDCD4 mRNA accessible to miR-21 and
leading to its degradation and loss of protein expression.

DISCUSSION

mRNA. A similar observation had been previously
described by Abdelmohsen and colleagues [33], where
they demonstrated that H2O2 causes phosphorylation of
HuR by Chk2 thus leading to dissociation of HuR from
SIRT1 mRNA and a consequent loss in SIRT1 protein.
Additionally, Yoon and colleagues [34] demonstrated
that tyrosine phosphorylation of HuR by JAK3
following arsenite treatment caused a dissociation of
HuR from SIRT1 and VHL target mRNAs leading to
their degradation. These findings point to a role for posttranslational modifications of HuR in determining HuR’s
ability to bind target mRNAs. Since knockdown of Chk2
followed by H2O2 treatment had no effect of PDCD4 levels
(data not shown) we sought to determine which kinase is
regulating HuR’s effect on PDCD4. Recently, ERK8 was
shown to be activated in response to H2O2 stress [30].
Therefore, we monitored the effect of ERK8 silencing on
PDCD4 levels. We determined that loss of ERK8 rescues
the levels of PDCD4 protein after H2O2 treatment and
that ERK8 specifically and directly phosphorylates HuR
in vitro, thus identifying HuR as a novel target of ERK8
kinase activity.
Interestingly, although there is increased expression
of both cytoplasmic HuR and miR-21 in primary
Glioblastoma cells [27, 35-37], the expression of PDCD4
in these cells is reduced. While the ratio of cytoplasmic
HuR and miR-21 will determine the fate of PDCD4
mRNA, we have shown that the binding affinity of HuR is
also critical for PDCD4 regulation. Therefore, in addition
to monitoring levels of HuR and miR-21, one should
consider assessing the activity of ERK8 and/or other
kinases that may phosphorylate HuR to alter its binding
affinity for specific targets.

Downregulation of the tumour suppressor PDCD4
is correlated with the initiation and progression of lung,
colon, liver, breast, and brain cancers [14-18]. Previously,
we identified PDCD4 as a regulator of IRES-mediated
translation of XIAP and Bcl-xL [22]. This regulation is
particularly important in cancer development because loss
of PDCD4 correlates with an increase in the expression
of these and other apoptosis-regulating proteins, thus
contributing to the cell’s ability to evade apoptosis
following treatment with chemotherapeutics [18, 21].
The important role of PDCD4 in tumorigenesis highlights
a need to elucidate the mechanism of PDCD4 protein
regulation. It is known that miR-21 regulates PDCD4
mRNA and targets it for degradation, leading to a loss
of protein expression [31]. Moreover, an increase in
miR-21 expression has been observed in many cancers,
which likely contributes to the frequently observed loss
of PDCD4 [25-27]. Since HuR and PDCD4 regulate
the same IRES-containing mRNAs [8, 9, 22], and HuR
has been implicated in regulating miRNA-mediated
degradation of mRNAs, we aimed to determine if HuR
plays a role in regulating PDCD4 expression. Indeed, we
observed that HuR regulates PDCD4 protein expression
via miR-21. SiRNA-mediated loss of HuR renders
PDCD4 mRNA readily available to miR-21 targeting,
leading to its degradation and decreased protein levels.
Interestingly, both the 3’ UTR of PDCD4 and the miR21 target sequence are AU-rich, which is compatible with
the HuR RNA target motif [32]. We demonstrate that HuR
binds to the PDCD4 3’UTR but that it does not bind to
the miR-21 binding site. Instead, our RNA EMSA analysis
suggests that initial binding of HuR to the site upstream
of the miR-21 binding site causes recruitment and further
multimerization of additional HuR proteins that sterically
hinder miR-21 binding. Furthermore, EMSA analysis
suggests that HuR can bind both miR21 and PDCD4
mRNA. However, HuR has a higher affinity for the
PDCD4 mRNA, which results in the observed effect on
PDCD4 mRNA stability and protein expression.
After cellular stress, HuR exits the nucleus and
accumulates in the cytoplasm where it typically binds
to and stabilizes target mRNAs. Therefore, we were
expecting to see a rescue in PDCD4 expression after
exposing cells to H2O2 stress. Unexpectedly, although
we observed a cytoplasmic accumulation of HuR
following H2O2 treatment, we did not observe a rescue
of PDCD4 expression. Instead, H2O2 treatment led to
the loss in both PDCD4 protein and mRNA levels. This
observation suggests that it is not the accumulation of
HuR in the cytoplasm that is affecting PDCD4 levels,
but rather, the modification of the already cytoplasmic
HuR after H2O2 treatment that is causing the effect. It
is possible that HuR is phosphorylated following H2O2,
which prevents it from being able to bind to its target

cultures were centrifuged at 5000 x g for 10 minutes at 4°C
and supernatant discarded. The pellet was resuspended in
10 mL of ice-cold PBS and the samples were centrifuged
again at 5000 x g for 10 minutes at 4°C. Samples were
then lysed with 10 mL lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl [pH
8.0], 200 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM DTT, 2 mM
PMSF). Lysates were sonicated twice, 1% Triton X-100
was added, and samples were sonicated again. Samples
were centrifuged at 13000 x g for 10 minutes at 4°C.
Glutathione sepharose beads (200 μL; GE Healthcare)
were added to the supernatant and rotated at 4°C for 2
hours. Samples were washed 5 times with cold PBS and
proteins were eluted using 20 mM L-glutathione, pH 8.0
in PBS rotating at 4°C for 1 hour.

Total RNA was isolated from cells using RNAzol
(Molecular Research Center, Inc.) as per manufacturer’s
protocol. cDNA was generated using the First-strand
cDNA synthesis kit (GE Biosciences). Quantitative
PCR was performed using the QuantiTect SYBR green
PCR kit (Qiagen) with gene specific primers for PDCD4
(QuantiTect Primer Assay; Qiagen) and GAPDH [22].

Actinomycin D
Seventy-two hours after siRNA transfection, HeLa
cells were treated with actinomycin D (Sigma-Aldrich),
dissolved in anhydrous ethanol, at a final concentration
of 5 µg/mL. After the chase period, cells were processed
for qRT-PCR to determine their half-life (t1/2) as described
[39]

RNA-protein complex immunoprecipitation

RNA electromobility shift assay

HeLa cells were treated with 0.5 mM H2O2 for 4
hours, washed twice with PBS and lysed in CHIP lysis
buffer (50 mM Hepes-KOH pH 7.5, 140 mM NaCl, 1 mM
EDTA pH 8.0, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, 0.1% sodium
deoxycholate, 1 mM PMSF, 5 µg/mL Aprotinin, 10 µg/mL
Leupeptin, 40 U/mL RNase inhibitor) for 30 minutes on
ice. Lysates were spun at 13, 000 rpm for 15 minutes and
supernatant was transferred to a new tube. Samples were
incubated with 10 µg mouse anti-HuR or anti-mouse IgG
for 2 hours at 4°C. Dynabeads Protein G (Novex by Life
Technologies) were washed with CHIP buffer and added to
samples (50 µL per sample) and rotated for 40 minutes at
4°C. Supernatant was removed and beads were washed 4
times with CHIP buffer. RNA was extracted with RNAzol
as per manufacturer’s protocol and qPCR was performed
using the QuantiTect SYBR green PCR kit (Qiagen).

Recombinant GST or GST-HuR was incubated
with 32P-labelled, in vitro transcribed RNA probe in
RNA binding buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl PH 7.5, 1.5 mM
MgCl2, 50 mM KCl, 0.5 mM DTT) for 30 minutes at room
temperature with or without Cy5.5 3’-labelled miR21
RNA (Dharmacon). The complexes were separated on a
6% polyacrylamide gel and the gel was exposed to X-ray
film at -80°C to detect autoradiography and subsequently
scanned with the Li-Cor Odyssey infrared scanner (LiCor Biosciences, Lincoln, NE) to detect the miR21 Cy5.5
signal.

Kinase assay
pCDNA3_Flag-HuR, pReciever_HA-ERK8, or
pCDNA3_Flag empty vector were transfected into HeLa
cells for 24 h and harvested in co-immunoprecipitation
buffer (25 mM Tris [pH 7.5], 150 mM NaCl, 50 mM
NaF, 0.5 mM EDTA [pH 8.0], 0.5% Triton X-100, 5
mM beta glycerophosphate, 5% glycerol, 1 mM DTT, 1
mM PMSF, 1 mM Na3VO4). Lysates were sonicated and
centrifuged for 15 min at 13,000 x g at 4°C. Anti-Flag
agarose beads (Sigma) were incubated with the lysate for
1 h at 4°C and washed 3 times in lysis buffer followed by
a wash in kinase buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl [pH 7.5], 5 mM
beta-glycerolphosphate, 0.2 mM Na3VO4, 0.5 mM DTT).
Kinase and substrate on beads were incubated in kinase
buffer in the presence of (30 µM ATP, 6.6 mM MgCl2, 3.3
mM MnCl2) and 5 µCi of γ- 32P-labelled ATP for 20 min
at 30°C. Laemmli sample buffer was added, and samples
were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to a PVDF
membrane, and exposed to X-ray film. The membrane was
subsequently analyzed by Western blotting.

Immunofluorescence
Cells were grown on coverslips and treated with
H2O2 or PBS as indicated and fixed with 3% formaldehyde
in PBS for 10 minutes at room temperature. Cells were
permeablized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 5
minutes at room temperature on a shaker, rinsed twice
with PBS, and blocked with 5% bovine serum albumin
(BSA) in PBS for 1 hour. Primary antibody was added
(mouse anti-HuR (1:500 dilution in 5% BSA in PBS)
and incubated with cells overnight at 4°C, followed by 3
washes with PBS for 5 minutes each. Secondary antibody
(alexa fluor 488 goat anti-mouse (Life Technologies;
1:1000 dilution in PBS) was added for 1 hour followed
by three 5 minute washes in PBS. Nuclei were stained
with Hoechst 33342 (Pierce) for 5 minutes and washed
with PBS twice. Coverslips were mounted on slides using
Fluoromount (Sigma Aldrich). Confocal microscopy was
performed using the 60X objective with immersion oil
(Olympus Fluoview FV1000, Richmond Hill, Ontario
Canada). Quantification of HuR nuclear and cytoplasmic
distribution was done as described previously [40] with
some modifications. The images were analyzed on a
Columbus Image Analysis Server (Perkin Elmer) using
an embedded Acapella Image Analysis Software (Perkin
Elmer) script. Nuclei were segmented and defined using
their Hoechst 33342 staining. The cytoplasmic region
was defined as a ring of 9 pixel width that encircled the
nucleus 1 pixels away from its outside edge. The nuclear/
cytoplasmic ratio of HuR was calculated from the average
intensity of HuR fluorescent signal measured per cell
within these regions. Higher ratio number represent more
nuclear distribution.

Statistical analysis
An unpaired t-test was performed using GraphPad
Prism version 5.00 for Windows (GraphPad Software, San
Diego, CA) to determine p-value in repeated experiments.
All results are shown as mean ± standard deviation. For
RT-qPCR experiments, average RNA expression was
calculated using data collected from three biological
replicates and three technical replicates for each biological
replicate. Unless otherwise noted, all results were obtained
through a minimum of three independent experimental
replications.
