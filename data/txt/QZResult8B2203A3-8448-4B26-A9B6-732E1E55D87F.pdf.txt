Abstract
Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts

Angiogenesis is required for tumour growth and is induced principally by VEGF-A. VEGF-A premRNA is alternatively spliced at the terminal exon to produce two families of isoforms, pro- and
anti-angiogenic, only the former of which is upregulated in prostate cancer. In renal epithelial cells
and colon cancer cells, the choice of VEGF splice isoforms is controlled by the splicing factor
SRSF1, phosphorylated by SRPK1. Immunohistochemistry staining of human samples revealed a
significant increase in SRPK1 expression both in prostate intra-epithelial neoplasia lesions as well
as malignant adenocarcinoma compared to benign prostate tissue. We therefore tested the
hypothesis that the selective upregulation of pro-angiogenic VEGF in prostate cancer may be
under the control of SRPK1 activity. A switch in the expression of VEGF165 towards the antiangiogenic splice isoform, VEGF165b, was seen in PC-3 cells with SRPK1 knock-down (KD).
PC-3 SRPK1-KD cells resulted in tumours that grew more slowly in xenografts, with decreased
microvessel density. No effect was seen as a result of SRPK1-KD on growth, proliferation,
migration and invasion capabilities of PC-3 cells in vitro. Small molecule inhibitors of SRPK1
switched splicing towards the anti-angiogenic isoform VEGF165b in PC3 cells and decreased
tumour growth when administered intraperitoneally in an orthotopic mouse model of prostate

INTRODUCTION
Prostate cancer (PCa) is the most commonly diagnosed non-skin cancer and the 3rd most
common cause of cancer death in men in the Western world (1-4). While many men have
indolent disease that can be cured with localized therapies, a significant minority of men will
relapse and eventually progress to castration-resistant PCa. The majority of lethal PCa is due
to spread through castration-resistant metastasis (5, 6).
Alongside the long-established treatments for PCa including prostatectomy, radiotherapy
and androgen-deprivation there is currently a list of therapies that have been approved
recently or are still in development that target various pathogenic processes shown to be
important for PCa progression – e.g androgen-related, targeting several signaling pathways
(PI3K-Akt-mTOR, IGFIR, hedgehog), immunomodulators and vaccines, epigenetic
modifiers as well as bone-specific treatments (7-9).

Angiogenesis has been described as being essential for tumour growth (10). It is today
recognized as one of the hallmarks of cancer (11) and subject to intense investigations for
therapeutic control. There are many studies that have suggested angiogenesis to be important
in PCa: VEGF is expressed at high levels in human PCa cell lines (12, 13); urine and plasma
levels of VEGF are increased in advanced stages of PCa (14-16) and microvessel density
correlates with PCa metastasis and Gleason score (17). However, all of these studies show
correlations and do not demonstrate causality i.e. is angiogenesis driving the prostate cancer
progression and spread or is it, for example, an associated phenomenon resulting from the
hypoxic environment of tumour growth? The most definitive answer to this question may
come only from studies assessing the efficacy of anti-angiogenic therapy in PCa patients.
Based on this rationale several multi-centre studies have been initiated using combinations
of adjuvant anti-angiogenic therapies that target angiogenesic molecules e.g VEGF or
VEGFRs, angiopoetins [reviewed in (18)]. To date, the results are discouraging for
angiogenesis specific agents - e.g a phase III study recently completed that used
bevacizumab (humanized antibody against VEGF) in addition to docetaxel and prednisone,
failed to show a significant improvement in overall survival (19). Several other phase III
studies of anti-VEGF based strategies have failed to improve survival in unselected patients
with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRCP) including sunitinib (a VEGF/
PDGF tyrosine kinase inhibitor) and aflibercept (VEGF trap) (18). Several explanations
have been advanced for the failure of these studies including excess treatment-related

toxicities, lack of patient selection and dilution of treatment effect given the notorious
heterogeneity of PCa at every level (clinical, histopathological or molecular)(19).

Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts

More than 10 years ago a 3′ alternative splicing event in the terminal exon of VEGF-A premRNA was described that does not change the number of amino-acids in the VEGF protein
but rather the sequence of the last six amino-acids (20). This gives rise to a family of VEGF
isoforms (VEGFxxxb, with the dominant isoform VEGF165b) that act as antagonist/partialagonist to the main VEGF receptor (VEGFR2) (21). VEGF165b has been shown in several
studies to be anti-angiogenic (22-24). An alternative hypothesis for the failure of antiangiogenic therapies in PCa which has not been considered thus far, is that the abovementioned studies use treatments that inhibit all VEGF isoforms regardless of their pro/antiangiogenic potential and/or do not select patients based on these VEGF isoforms. Indeed, it
has been shown, for example, that pro/anti-angiogenic VEGF isoform balance can predict
response to anti-VEGF antibodies in animals (25) and humans in colon carcinoma (26).
We recently described an essential pathway that regulates the choice of pro/anti-angiogenic
splicing isoforms that involves the serine-arginine protein kinase 1 (SRPK1) and splicing
factor SRSF1 (27, 28) in renal epithelial cells and in colon carcinoma. We have shown that
knock-down of SRPK1 in colon adenocarcinoma cells (LS174t) increases the levels of antiangiogenic splicing isoform VEGF165b and inhibits tumour growth in a xenograft model.
SRPK1 is a kinase, a class of proteins that have proven recently to be exceptional targets for
oncology therapeutic development. Our previous findings suggested that selective SRPK
inhibitors could act as anti-angiogenic agents and novel cancer treatments in cancers where
SRPK1 was active.

The aim of this study was therefore to assess whether the SRPK1-SRSF1 axis is upregulated
in PCa human samples and cell lines and, if so, test the hypotheses that i) manipulation of
VEGF165b levels and SRPK1 axis in PCa cells is able to decrease tumour growth in
xenografts models and ii) that this is primarily due to an effect on VEGF splicing. The
ultimate goal was to provide basic proof-of-principle studies for use of SRPK1 inhibitors in
PCa treatment.

Results
SRPK1 and SRSF1 expression in human PCa
In a previous study (23) we reported that the anti-angiogenic VEGF165b splice isoform is
strongly down-regulated in malignant human prostate tissue compared to benign tissue,
based on transurethral sections of the prostate (TURP) samples. The choice of pro/antiangiogenic VEGF isoforms has been shown in colonic and renal epithelial cells to be under
the control of SRSF1 and SRPK1 and knockdown of SRPK1 switched splicing from
VEGF165 to VEGF165b in colon carcinoma cells (LS174t)(27). Here we show that in a
mouse subcutaneous xenograft model of prostate cancer using human PC-3 cells,
intraperitoneal administration of rhVEGF165b is also able to decrease prostate tumour
growth in a similar manner to the anti-VEGF antibody bevacizumab and this is associated
with a decrease in microvessel density in tumours (Supplementary Figure 1). We therefore

considered that the expression level of SRPK1 and SRSF1 in human prostate cancer tissue
may be able to control VEGF-A165b expression and thus be a potential target for therapy.

Samples from 17 patients with radical prostatectomy were immuno-stained for SRPK1 and
SRSF1 (Figure 1). Staining intensities were scored by a urological pathologist in benign
areas, PIN lesions, as well as malignant parts of the gland. SRPK1 staining (Figure 1A) was
significantly increased in both PIN and malignant regions compared to benign areas of the
samples (Figure 1B). SRSF1 staining (Figure 1C) was increased in malignant but not PIN
lesions (Figure 1D).
SRPK1 knock-down results in a splicing switch from pro- to anti-angiogenic VEGF
isoforms in PCa cells
SRPK1 expression was assessed in several PCa cell lines (PC-3, DU145 and LNCaP) in
comparison with normal prostate epithelial cells by qRT-PCR (Figure 2A). The highest
expression was present in PC-3 cells. At the protein level SRPK1 was also higher in PC-3
and DU145 cells when compared to LNCaP (Figure 2B). This heterogeneity was reflective
of PCa samples where SRPK1 is increased in ~ 50% of patients (Figure 1B). We therefore
used PC-3 in further studies to understand the role of SRPK1 in those prostate cancers with
increased expression.

To establish whether the SRPK1-VEGF splicing regulation was present in PC-3 cells we
generated a stable knock-down of SRPK1. PC-3 cells were transduced with lentivirus
containing shRNAi to SRPK1 or scrambled shRNAi, selected in puromycin for 3 weeks and
mRNA and protein extracted. The extent of knock-down was assessed both by qRT-PCR
and Western blotting (Supplementary Figure 2). RT-PCR analysis, Western blot and ELISA
demonstrated that there was a switch towards the VEGF165b isoform in cells with stable
SRPK1-KD (Figure 2 C,D and Supplementary Figure 3). Interestingly, the fold-increase in
VEGF165b at protein level (2D) seems to be higher than at the RNA level (2C) suggesting a
possible additional post-transcriptional layer of regulation (see discussion).
To determine whether SRPK1-KD in PC3 cells influenced SR protein expression and/or
phosphorylation, western blot analysis was performed. Supplementary Figure 4 shows that
expression of different SR proteins was not affected but there was a pronounced decrease in
phosphorylation in SRSF 1, 2 and 5 in KD cells compared to controls.
SRPK1 knock-down does not affect cell growth, proliferation, invasion and migration of
PC-3 cells in vitro
SRPK1 is a kinase with multiple SR-proteins as targets, which in turn affect splicing of
several genes (28). Moreover, PC-3 cells express VEGFR2 and 1 as well as neuropilin 1
(Supplementary Figure 5) which potentially could respond to different VEGF ligands. Thus
SRPK1-KD could result in differential autocrine effects of VEGF isoforms on PC-3 cells
that may affect their ability to proliferate, invade and migrate. Cell counting assays showed
no significant difference at any time point between the growth rates of PC-3 SRPK1-KD
compared with control cells at the same time point (p>0.05, two-way ANOVA, n=3
experiments of three independent replicates) (Figure 3A). Cell proliferation was also

assessed with Ki-67 staining, and again there was no significant difference between the
proliferation rates of PC-3 SRPK1-KD and control cells (p>0.05, two-way ANOVA, n=2
experiments of three independent replicates). (Figure 3B). The potential of cells to migrate
and invade was determined using a Matrigel invasion assay. There was no significant
difference in the number of cells migrating between PC-3 SRPK1-KD and control (CTRL)
groups (p=0.06, unpaired t-test) (Figure 3C). The same experiment was repeated using a
different migration set-up – Fluoroblock membranes (BD Biosciences) with the same result
(data not shown). Furthermore, no difference in migration velocities between PC-3 cells
with SRPK1-KD and control cells were observed in a scratch-wound assay (p>0.05, twoway ANOVA, n=3) (Figure 3D).
These data taken together suggest that SRPK1-KD does not result in an effect on PC-3 cells,
by regulating VEGF or other genes splicing, that would influence their rate of growth,
proliferation, migration or invasion in vitro.
SRPK1 knock-down reduces subcutaneous PC-3 tumour growth in vivo through inhibition
of angiogenesis in a manner dependent on VEGF splicing
Since SRPK1-KD induced a splicing switch towards VEGF anti-angiogenic isoforms we
investigated whether this would affect the rate of tumour growth in vivo. 1×106 PC-3
SRPK1-KD or control cells were injected subcutaneously in the flank of male nude mice
and tumour volume was monitored. There was a significant decrease in tumour growth rate
in PC-3 SRPK1-KD mice compared with control (n=9), *=p<0.05, two-way ANOVA
(Figure 4A and examples of tumour growth in mice in Figure 4B).

Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts

At day 29 the mice were culled and RNA from the tumour samples was subjected to qRTPCR to examine SRPK1 expression (normalized to total amount of RNA). There was a
significant difference in the mean SRPK1 expression between the two groups (***p<0.001
t-test) and there was a significant positive correlation of SRPK1 copy number and tumour
volume (***p<0.001, r=0.7377 Spearman Rank Correlation test) (Supplementary Figure 6).
PC-3 SRPK1-KD or control tumour samples were stained for CD31 endothelial cell marker
and the blood vessel density counted. There was a significant reduction in blood vessel
density in PC-3 SRPK1-KD mice compared with control. (*p<0.05 unpaired t-test) (Figure 4
C,D). Western blot analysis of protein extracts from tumours shows SRPK1-KD corresponds
to a decrease in VEGF levels (see examples in Figure 4E).
These data taken together suggest that the main effect through which SRPK1 causes a
decrease in tumour growth is by affecting angiogenesis through a switch in VEGF splicing
isoforms from pro-angiogenic to anti-angiogenic. To more clearly test this hypothesis we
designed a VEGF-rescue experiment in vivo in which we asked whether VEGF165 cDNA
overexpression driven by a VEGF-promoter (which would mimic endogenous VEGF but be
insensitive to alternative splicing) could rescue the tumour growth in SRPK1-KD cells.
SRPK1-KD or control cells were transfected with a plasmid containing the VEGF165 cDNA
under the control of the VEGF promoter. SRPK1-KD did not affect VEGF promoter activity
in PC3 cells, as assessed in vitro using a luciferase reporter plasmid driven by the

endogenous VEGF promoter sequence (Supplementary Figure 7). One million PC-3
SRPK1-KD/VEGF165 and CTRL KD/VEGF165 cells were injected subcutaneously in the
flank of male nude mice and tumour volume was monitored. As a control, 1×106 PC-3
SRPK1-KD/pCDNA3 and CTRL/pCDNA3 cells (transfected with empty plasmid) were
injected in parallel. The ability of the cell to generate VEGF165 (circles) significantly
rescued the inhibition of tumour growth in the presence of SRPK1-KD (filled symbols,
p<0.01, two-way ANOVA). SRPK1-KD thus had no effect on cells that could express
VEGF165 under control of the VEGF promoter (circles, p>0.1, two way ANOVA) but did in
the cells expressing multiple isoforms of VEGF (squares, p<0.05 two-way ANOVA).
*=p<0.05, **=p<0.01 compared with SRPK1 KD-VEGF165 (Figures 5A and B).
SRPK1 levels were decreased in tumours grown from SRPK1-KD cells compared with
control cells in both sets with either expression of empty vector plasmid (Figure 6A, left
panel) or VEGF plasmid (Figure 6A, right panel). Also, VEGF levels were increased in
tumours grown from cells over-expressing VEGF cDNA plasmid compared to cells
transfected with empty vector, both in the presence of SRPK1-KD (Figure 6B, left panel) or
absence (Figure 6B, right panel).
Small molecule inhibitors of SRPK1 are able to switch VEGF splicing in vitro in PC-3 cells
and decrease tumour growth in vivo in an orthotopic PCa mouse model
We have previously shown that several SRPK1 inhibitors are able to switch VEGF splicing
towards the anti-angiogenic isoforms in vitro and have anti-angiogenic effects in vivo in
different systems (27, 29, 30). Since SRPK1-KD is able to slow tumour growth in PC-3
xenografts we enquired whether chemical inhibition of SRPK1 may have similar results in a
therapeutic proof-of-principle experiment.

To examine changes in SR protein phosphorylation, PC-3 cells were treated with SRPK1
inhibitors followed by EGF, previously shown to induce SRPK1-dependent SR activation
(31). Two different inhibitors were used at 10 μM; SPHINX, and SRPIN340 which have
different selectivities for SRPK1 (30). After 30 min pre-treatment with the inhibitors, cells
were incubated with 100 ng/ml EGF for an hour and protein extracted. Immunoblot analysis
for phosphorylated SR proteins revealed a 115% up-regulation of phosphoSRSF1/2 and 90%
upregulation of pSRSF5, but no change in pSRSF6 upon EGF treatment, compared with
control treated cells (DMSO 0.02%). However, prior treatment with the inhibitors resulted in
reduction of EGF-dependent SRSF1/2 phosphorylation (to 14 and 1% by SRPIN340 and
SPHINX respectively) but not SRSF5 (60% and 50% increase respectively) (Figure 7A).
This was confirmed in a different experimental design where phospho-SR proteins were
immunoprecipitated with mAb 104 antibody followed by immunoblotting with SRSF1
antibody (Supplementary figure 8).
The effect of SPHINX on VEGF protein isoform expression was also examined (Figure 7B).
There was a significant down-regulation of VEGF165 after treatment with 5 and 10μM
SPHINX compared with control (p=0.020; One-way ANOVA, *=p<0.05). However, at
20μM treatment, the reduction of the pro-angiogenic isoform was lost and no difference was
observed compared to control group (p>0.05, One-way ANOVA). Subsequently, the
expression of VEGF165b isoform was examined using an antibody against all VEGFxxxb

isoforms. As shown in Figure 7B, there was a significant effect on VEGF165b expression
upon treatment with the small molecule inhibitor.

Based on these results and to examine the hypothesis that SRPK1 is a therapeutic target for
PCa, we used the orthotopic PCa model to assess the effect of SPHINX on tumour growth.
1×106 PC-3 RFP-tagged cells, resuspended in 20 μl of sterile PBS, were injected in the
prostate gland of male nude mice. The use of PC-3 RFP expressing cells enabled the
detection and quantification of tumours, beneath the skin, using the IVIS Lumina system
(examples of fluorescent detection are shown in Figure 7C). Once tumours reached
approximately 4-5 ×1010 photons per second (p/s), mice were treated. Two treatment groups
were used: intra-peritoneal injections of 20 μg SPHINX or saline three times a week. In the
control treated groups, the fluorescence signal increased. The fluorescence was quantitated
as shown in figure 7D, It should be noted that the images shown in figure 7B show both
direct and reflected light collected from the cone emitting from the fluorescent source, and
so do not reflect metastasis, but an increased size of primary tumour. This was confirmed
when the mice were killed and dissected and no dissemination as seen but a large primary
growth. Treatment with SPHINX resulted in a significant inhibition of tumour growth
compared with saline group (p<0.05 and p<0.01, two-way ANOVA, Figure 7D).

Discussion
Angiogenesis is an essential process through which growing tumours are able to form blood
vessels and obtain necessary nutrients. However, tumour cells can be very heterogeneous in
their metabolism and therefore their dependence on oxygen and nutrients, with some of the
most aggressive cancer cells being able to survive and proliferate with poor energy supplies
(11).

Whilst correlation of tumour growth and progressive phenotype with microvessel density
may provide clues for the importance of angiogenesis in cancers, including PCa, the ultimate
proof of how reliant cancer growth is on angiogenesis comes from studies in which
angiogenesis inhibitors are used. The discouraging results of recent trials using antiangiogenic therapies on patients with advanced PCa may be explained, at least in part, by an
incomplete knowledge of the regulation and biology of VEGF (the main determinant of
angiogenesis) which most of these studies are set to inhibit. These studies use compounds
that inhibit all forms of VEGF (either directly e.g bevacizumab, or indirectly through
receptor inhibition e.g sunitinib) without taking into account the diversity of VEGF
molecules and their functions (i.e some of them are naturally anti-angiogenic) acquired
through numerous levels of gene regulation, including alternative splicing. Only recently a
few studies on patients with various cancers (but not PCa) have taken into account the
response to bevacizumab therapy depending on various VEGF isoforms [reviewed in (32)].
We have shown previously that the kinase SRPK1 is one of the most important regulators of
the VEGF165/VEGF165b splicing switch (through modulation of the SR protein family
splicing factor SRSF1) and that SRPK1-KD in colon carcinoma cell line LS174t inhibits
tumour growth by inhibiting angiogenesis (27). Several small molecules inhibitors for
SRPK1 exist [e.g SRPIN340 (33) and SPHINX (30)].

SRPK1 has been reported to be up-regulated in several cancers: for example breast, colon
and pancreas (34); ovarian (35); non-small cell lung carcinoma (36) or hepatocellular
carcinoma (37). Here we show that SRPK1 expression was much higher in samples from
patients with malignant PCa compared to normal prostate tissue (Figure 1A). This correlates
with data previously reported that malignant prostate tissue expresses the pro-angiogenic
VEGF isoform while normal tissue shows a combination of both isoforms (23).
Interestingly, SRPK1 expression was also significantly higher in PIN lesions when
compared to benign tissue. This may suggest that activation of SRPK1 and therefore
promotion of pro-angiogenic splicing in VEGF might be an early event in development of
prostate cancer and moreover, indicates that angiogenesis may be a causal phenomenon that
drives PCa progression and not a consequence of an increasing hypoxic environment during
tumourigenesis. However, it was also interesting that SRPK1 was not raised in all prostate
cancers (Figure 1B), and that some prostate cancer lines (e.g. LNCaP) do not have high
SRPK1 expression. These cells may have other splicing regulatory pathways that are altered.
Furthermore, SRSF1 expression (which is downstream of SRPK1) was significantly
increased in malignant but not PIN lesions (Figure 1C), which may underlie the progressive
and sequential activation of SRPK1-SRSF1 axis in PCa. It is not yet known whether SRSF1
expression follows aggressiveness in cancer cell lines, but it would be interesting to compare
this across prostate cancer cell lines. Moreover, other splice factors like SRSF5 and SRSF6
have been shown to be involved in splicing of VEGF at the terminal exon and future
assessments of expression of these factors in human samples will hopefully provide a
comprehensive picture of SRPK1-SR axis in PCa.

Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts

We further show that SRPK1-KD switches the balance of the main VEGF splicing isoform
towards the anti-angiogenic one in PC3 cells (Figure 2) and inhibits tumour growth in PC3
xenografts with associated decrease in microvessel density (Figure 4). It did this by reducing
the amount of VEGF-A165a, i.e. switching from active to repressed proximal splicing. Of
interest the switch in splicing at the protein level indicated a higher level of VEGF-A165b
protein than that suggested by the PCR. This could be due to differential translation, but is
likely also to be due to competition in amplification when two transcripts are generated from
the same target sequence. VEGF-A165 competes with VEGF-A165b for primer annealing,
resulting in over-representation of the most common isoform. Therefore a small increase in
the PCR signal could result from a large increase in the relative abundance (38). SRPK1 has
multiple targets beside SRSF1 and its knock-down has been shown to affect other hallmarks
of cancer in different cancers (see references above). However, SRPK1-KD in PC-3 cells
does not have any autocrine effect on cell growth, proliferation, migration and invasion in
vitro (Figure 3), a feature that is different from cell lines representative for other types of
cancers. Moreover, expression in SRPK1-KD cells of splicing-insensitive VEGF cDNA
driven by VEGF endogenous promoter, rescues tumour growth (Figure 5). These data taken
together strongly suggest that the main reason for inhibition of tumour growth in PC-3 cells
with SRPK1-KD is the effect on angiogenesis and is unlikely to be related to other
hallmarks of cancer. In addition, SRPK1-KD has no influence on the VEGF promoter (see
Supplementary Figure 7) providing additional support for the hypothesis that the SRPK1KD effect is mediated through the switch in VEGF splicing isoforms.

Finally, in a therapeutic proof-of-principle experiment we show that SRPK1 inhibitors are
able to inhibit phosphorylation of relevant SR proteins and switch VEGF splicing in vitro
(Figure 7A, B). One of the inhibitors, SPHINX, decreases tumour growth when
administered repetitively intraperitoneally in a mouse model of orthotopic prostate cancer
using PC3 cells (Figure 7C).

In conclusion, our study identifies SRPK1 as a key molecule in regulating the balance of
VEGF splice isoforms in PC-3 cells whose inhibition results in decrease in tumour growth
due to the effect on angiogenesis. This encourages novel studies into the potential use of
small molecule inhibitors of SRPK1 in PCa as anti-angiogenic therapy.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell Culture
PC-3 and DU145 cell lines were cultured in DMEM and LNCap cells in RPMI1640 with
10% FBS and antibiotics. PC3, LNCaP and DU145 cells were purchased from ATCC; cells
were authenticated by Short Tandem Repeat Profiling at Identicell, Denmark (08/2011).
Primary prostate epithelial cells were purchased from Lonza, not authenticated and cultured
in PrEBM medium (Lonza). SRPK1-KD cell sublines were generated by transduction of cell
lines with lentivirus encoding shRNAi to SRPK1 (Dharmacon). Transduced PC-3 cells were
transfected with VEGF165 plasmid or empty pcDNA3 using Fugene HD and selected in
Geneticin.
Proliferation assay

Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts

105 cells seeded in 6-well plates were counted after 24, 48 and 72 hours using a
haemocytometer. For Ki67 proliferation assay, 105 cells were serum starved for 8 hours.
Twenty-four, 48 and 72 hours after starvation, cells were fixed with 4% PFA and incubated
with anti-Ki67 antibody 1:100 (Abcam), overnight at 4°C. Alexa-fluor 488 goat anti-rabbit
antibody (1:750) was used as secondary. The proliferation potential of cells was measured
on Image J, by calculating the total nuclear intensity of Ki67 and normalising to total
nuclear area.
Migration-invasion assays
Scratch wound assay - 1mm thick line was scratched off the cell monolayer using a sterile
tip. The migration potential of cells was determined by measuring the distance covered by
cells (Image J) during 24 or 48 hours to the middle of the scratch wound. For the migrationinvasion assay, 50μl of matrigel (Sigma) were added into each chamber (Millipore) prior to
plating the cells. 5×104 cells, re-suspended in DMEM containing 2% FBS, were then plated
onto the chambers. DMEM with 10% FBS was added in the wells of the plates to generate a
serum gradient. After incubation inserts were fixed in 4% PFA and stained with Hoechst. To
assess invasion potential, 5 fields of view were taken at ×20 magnification and cells
counted.

with a caliper every 3 days and tumour volume was calculated according to the formula:
[(length+width)/2]*length*width. When the first tumour reached 16mm in diameter, mice
were culled, tumours were excised, half homogenised in Trizol for RNA extraction and the
other half embedded in paraffin for staining. For orthotopic implantation RFP-tagged PC-3
cells (AntiCancer Inc., San Diego)(39) were surgically injected into the prostate of nude
mice and tumour growth monitored using a Xenogen IVIS device.

Paraffin embedded samples were cut in 5-7mm sections and standard IHC protocols were
used. For vessel density rabbit polyclonal CD31 antibody (Abcam) and DAB kit (Vector
Laboratories) was used for colour development. For SRPK1 immunohistochemistry, rabbit
anti-SRPK1 primary antibody (Sigma) was used at 1μg/ml concentration and Fast-Red
solution (Sigma) for colour development.
Blood vessel density
Two sections from each tumour were analysed using a Nikon E400 microscope (×40
objective). Blood vessels were identified and counted based on CD31 positive staining, and
mean number of blood vessels per field-of-view (3 fields-of-view per section) was
calculated.
Human samples scoring
Scoring was done blindly by a histopathologist (JO) according to the intensity of staining – 0
for no staining; 1 for weak; 2 for moderate and 3 for strong staining.
