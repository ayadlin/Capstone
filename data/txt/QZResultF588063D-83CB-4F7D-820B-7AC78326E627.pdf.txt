Abstract

Author Manuscript

In epithelial tissues, the lineage relationship between normal progenitor cells and cell type(s) of
origin for cancer has been poorly understood. Here we show that a known regulator of prostate
epithelial differentiation, the homeobox gene Nkx3.1, marks a stem cell population that functions
during prostate regeneration. Genetic lineage-marking demonstrates that rare luminal cells which
express Nkx3.1 in the absence of testicular androgens (castration-resistant Nkx3.1-expressing
cells, CARNs) are bipotential and can self-renew in vivo, while single-cell transplantation assays
show that CARNs can reconstitute prostate ducts in renal grafts. Functional assays of Nkx3.1

mutant mice in serial prostate regeneration assays suggest that Nkx3.1 is required for stem cell
maintenance. Finally, targeted deletion of the Pten tumor suppressor gene in CARNs results in
rapid formation of carcinoma following androgen-mediated regeneration. These observations
indicate that CARNs represent a novel luminal stem cell population that is an efficient target for
oncogenic transformation in prostate cancer.

Author Manuscript

The prostate represents an excellent system for studying the function and molecular
regulation of adult epithelial stem cells in the context of both tissue regeneration and cancer.
The prostate epithelium is comprised of three differentiated cell types: luminal secretory
cells, basal cells, and neuroendocrine cells (Fig. 1a)1. Androgen-deprivation leads to rapid
apoptosis of approximately 90% of luminal cells and a small percentage of basal cells,
although a stable cell number is maintained in the regressed state2,3. Following readministration of androgens, the prostate epithelium regenerates over approximately two
weeks2–4, and is capable of more than 15 rounds of serial regression/regeneration5,6,
implying that the prostate epithelium contains a long-term population of castration-resistant
stem cells.

Author Manuscript

Substantial evidence supports the existence of a basal stem cell population in the prostate7,
consistent with analyses of progenitor cells in other epithelial tissues8. In particular,
subpopulations of basal cells isolated using cell-surface markers display bipotentiality and
self-renewal in explant culture and tissue grafts9–13. Furthermore, single
Lin−Sca-1+CD133+CD44+CD117+ cells, which are predominantly basal in the mouse and
exclusively basal in the human, can reconstitute prostatic ducts in renal grafts14. However,
explants from p63 null mice can form prostate tissue and undergo multiple rounds of serial
regression/regeneration in the absence of basal cells15, suggesting the existence of a distinct
luminal stem cell population. To date, however, luminal stem cells have not been identified
in the prostate or other stratified epithelial tissues.
Although basal stem/progenitor cells have been proposed to represent a cell type of
origin7,16,17, human prostate cancer has a strikingly luminal phenotype. Notably, the
absence of basal cells is a diagnostic feature for prostate adenocarcinoma18,19, suggesting
either that prostate cancer arises from a luminal cell, or that oncogenic transformation of a
basal progenitor results in rapid differentiation of luminal progeny. Here we show that
expression of the Nkx3.1 homeobox gene in the androgen-deprived prostate epithelium
marks a rare luminal cell population that displays stem/progenitor properties during prostate
regeneration. Our findings also indicate the relevance of this luminal stem cell population as
a cell type of origin for prostate cancer.

Detection of CARNs in the prostate
The Nkx3.1 homeobox gene regulates prostate epithelial differentiation, and is frequently
inactivated at early stages of prostate tumorigenesis20. Notably, Nkx3.1 homozygous mutant
mice develop prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN), a precursor of prostate cancer, by one
year of age21–23. In the intact adult mouse prostate, all luminal cells express Nkx3.1, while
9.5% of p63+ basal cells (n=4291) also express Nkx3.1 (Fig. 1b; Supp. Fig. 1a)24. Previous
studies have shown that Nkx3.1 expression in prostate epithelial cells is reduced or abolished

in the absence of androgens in vivo, and is consequently androgen-dependent25,26. Thus,
Nkx3.1 expression is rapidly lost following castration, while Nkx3.1 expression is quickly
restored after androgen re-administration to induce prostate regeneration (Fig. 1c,d; Supp.
Fig. 1b).
However, Nkx3.1 expression is not completely absent in the regressed prostate, but is
instead retained in a rare population of epithelial cells (Fig. 1c,e). These CAstrationResistant Nkx3.1-expressing cells (CARNs) comprise 0.7% of total epithelial cells
(n=38,329) in the anterior prostate of androgen-deprived males, or approximately 460
CARNs per mouse (Supp. Table 1). In addition, CARNs are frequently clustered (Fig. 1e),
and can be detected in the ventral and dorsal prostate, as well as after a second round of
regression (Supp. Fig. 1c–f).

Author Manuscript

Importantly, all CARNs in the regressed prostate are strictly luminal, since they never
express the basal cell marker p63 (n=0/379) or the neuroendocrine marker synaptophysin
(n=0/610) (Fig. 1f; Supp. Table 1). Instead, CARNs express the luminal markers cytokeratin
18 (CK18) (n=828/837) and androgen receptor (AR) (n=46/46) and are growth-quiescent, as
they do not co-express Ki67 (n=0/151) (Fig. 1g; Supp. Fig. 1g,h). The CARNs population is
non-overlapping with the Lin−Sca-1+CD133+CD44+CD117+ stem/progenitor population14,
since CD117 (c-kit) positive cells in regressed prostate are never luminal (n=0/79) (Supp.
Fig. 1k,l). Furthermore, since the CARNs population is strictly luminal, it is also distinct
from other previously described prostate stem cell populations that are exclusively
basal9,10,13.

Bipotentiality and self-renewal
Author Manuscript

To investigate whether the CARNs population might correspond to prostate epithelial
progenitors, we performed in vivo lineage-marking using a knock-in allele that places a
tamoxifen-inducible Cre recombinase27,28 under the transcriptional control of the Nkx3.1
promoter (Supp. Fig. 2a). We assessed the specificity of the Nkx3.1CreERT2 allele in control
crosses with the R26R-YFP Cre-reporter29 and the R26R-lacZ alleles30, and found that Cremediated recombination following tamoxifen administration faithfully recapitulates the
endogenous pattern of Nkx3.1 expression in the intact prostate (Supp. Fig. 2b–f).

Author Manuscript

We performed lineage-marking of CARNs by tamoxifen treatment of castrated
Nkx3.1CreERT2/+; R26R-YFP/+ or Nkx3.1CreERT2/+; R26R-lacZ/+ adult males (Fig. 2a,b). As
expected for genetic marking of CARNs in regressed prostate, we observed YFP
fluorescence/β-galactosidase expression in rare epithelial cells that were strictly luminal
(Supp. Table 1). These lineage-marked cells were never positive for the basal markers p63
(n=0/98) or CK14 (n=0/131), and almost never positive for CK5 (n=2/93), but always
expressed the luminal markers CK18 (n=123/123) and AR (n=94/94) (Fig. 2 c; Supp. Fig.
3a–d). Following regeneration, the percentage of lineage-marked cells increased 9-fold
(from 0.37% (n=19,825) to 3.3% (n=95,017), p<0.0001) (Fig. 2d), indicating the
proliferative potential of CARNs. Although most of the lineage-marked cells in regenerated
prostates were luminal, we observed occasional YFP+CK5+, YFP+p63+, or β-gal+CK14+
basal cells, corresponding to 3.0% of lineage-marked cells (n=559) (Fig. 2e; Supp. Fig. 3g–

l); this percentage of regenerated basal cells is consistent with the low percentage of basal
cells lost during regression2. Since all of the lineage-marked cells were luminal in the
regressed prostate, but could give rise to both basal and luminal cells during regeneration,
we conclude that the initial CARNs population contains bipotential progenitors.

Author Manuscript

To investigate the self-renewal of CARNs, we examined whether they could undergo at least
one cell division during prostate regeneration to generate a daughter cell that is also a
CARN. We determined whether lineage-marked CARNs in castrated Nkx3.1CreERT2/+;
R26R-YFP/+ mice would incorporate BrdU during prostate regeneration, while retaining
CARN identity (Nkx3.1 expression) after a subsequent prostate regression (Fig. 2f; Supp.
Fig. 3m). Such triple-positive Nkx3.1+YFP+BrdU+ cells were observed (Fig. 2g–i),
providing evidence for CARN self-renewal. In particular, the percentage of BrdU+ cells
among Nkx3.1+YFP+ cells, corresponding to CARNs in both the first and second regression,
represents the percentage of CARNs undergoing a self-renewal division (24%, n=68; Supp.
Table 2).
To assess long-term self-renewal, we examined the persistence of lineage-marked cells in
Nkx3.1CreERT2/+; R26R-YFP/+ mice after four rounds of regression/regeneration (Fig. 2j).
In these mice, YFP+ cells represented 3.0% (n=21,559) of the prostate epithelium, similar to
the percentage observed after one round (Fig. 2k,l). The persistence of YFP+ cells is
consistent with the maintenance of a constant stem cell number during regeneration, as
suggested by the ability of the epithelium to undergo apparently unlimited serial
regeneration5,6, and supports the long-term self-renewal of lineage-marked CARNs.

Single-cell transplantation of CARNs
Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

Next, we investigated whether CARNs could reconstitute prostate tissue in grafts generated
from single or multiple lineage-marked CARNs (Fig 3a; Supp. Fig. 4). To examine single
lineage-marked CARNs, we isolated individual YFP+ cells from suspensions of dissociated
prostate cells, followed by recombination with rat urogenital mesenchyme cells and renal
grafting in immunodeficient male mice (Supp. Fig. 5a–f). The resulting grafts generated
prostatic ducts with epithelial cells that were entirely YFP+ and that expressed luminal
markers (E-cadherin, CK18, AR), basal markers (p63, CK5), or neuroendocrine markers
(synaptophysin) (Fig. 3b–g; Supp. Fig. 5g,h); importantly, these ducts produced secretory
proteins and expressed Nkx3.1, which is prostate-specific (Fig. 3c,i). Furthermore, we
verified that the tissue formed in these grafts was unequivocally of mouse origin by nuclear
morphology31 (Supp. Fig. 6). Notably, the frequency of successful single-cell
transplantation of lineage-marked YFP+ cells (37%, n=43) was significantly greater than for
the YFP− control (3%, n=31; p<0.001) (Fig. 3j).

Nkx3.1 regulates progenitor maintenance
Since Nkx3.1 expression marks the CARNs population, we next investigated whether Nkx3.1
regulates progenitor maintenance and/or differentiation. First, we examined whether BrdU
label-retaining cells (LRCs) might be affected by Nkx3.1 inactivation, since in many tissues
(but not all32) such long-term growth-quiescent cells are enriched for progenitors33,34. In
the prostate, such LRCs can be identified by BrdU pulse-chase labeling during serial

regression/regeneration6 (Fig. 4a). Under conditions in which 1.4% of epithelial cells
(n=33,086) retained BrdU-labeling at the fifth regression, 14.0% of CARNs (n=193) were
also BrdU-positive (Fig. 4b–d; Supp. Table 3), indicating that a significant proportion of
CARNs are also LRCs. Secondly, the percentage of LRCs in Nkx3.1 mutants (0.3%,
n=86,601) was significantly less than in wild-type controls (0.8%, n=75,758; p=0.003) after
five rounds of regression/regeneration (Fig. 4e–g; Supp. Table 3), suggesting a decrease in
prostate epithelial progenitors.

Author Manuscript

We also observed phenotypic alterations in Nkx3.1 mutants after five rounds of serial
regeneration, including reduced anterior prostate volume relative to wild-type controls (Fig.
4h). At the histological level, the characteristic hyperplasia and PIN phenotype of Nkx3.1
homozygous (n=10) as well as heterozygous mice (n=8) was partially suppressed by three or
five rounds of serial regeneration, while no abnormalities were observed in wild-type
controls (n=9) treated in parallel (Supp. Fig. 7, Supp. Fig 8; Supp. Table 4). Notably, the
proliferative index of serially regenerated Nkx3.1−/− mutants was similar to controls (Supp.
Fig. 8h,i), in contrast with the elevated proliferation observed in intact Nkx3.1
homozygotes21. Overall, these findings suggest that Nkx3.1 is required for prostate stem cell
maintenance during serial regression/regeneration.

CARNs are a cell of origin for cancer

Author Manuscript

Finally, we investigated whether CARNs could represent a target of oncogenic
transformation in prostate cancer, by examining the effects of CARNs-specific deletion of
the tumor suppressor gene Pten, a key regulator of the PI3-kinase/Akt signaling pathway
that is frequently inactivated in human prostate cancer. For this purpose, we inducibly
deleted Pten in the CARNs population of castrated male mice carrying a conditional Pten
allele35 together with the inducible Nkx3.1CreERT2 allele (Fig. 5a). Following androgenmediated regeneration of the prostate, we observed rapid formation of high-grade PIN and
carcinoma with evidence of microinvasion in the Nkx3.1CreERT2/+; Ptenflox/flox mice (n=6),
whereas control Nkx3.1CreERT2/+; Pten+/+ mice were phenotypically normal (n=6) (Fig. 5b–
e). Notably, these PIN and carcinoma lesions showed increased proliferation and loss of
basal cells, and displayed membrane-localized phospho-Akt activity (Fig. 5f–m). These data
indicate that the CARNs population can serve as a cell of origin for prostate cancer, and that
the resulting carcinoma lesions have a luminal phenotype.

Discussion
Author Manuscript

In context with previous studies describing basal stem cells9,10,13, our identification of
CARNs as luminal stem cells indicates the existence of distinct non-overlapping stem cell
populations in the prostate epithelium. Consequently, we can propose two general models
for the lineage relationship between CARNs and a basal stem cell population. One
possibility is that basal and luminal cell types may possess independent progenitors that
have partially redundant stem cell activities (Fig. 6a). A second possibility is that CARNs
represent facultative or “potential” stem cells corresponding to transit-amplifying cells that
acquire stem cell properties during regeneration/wound healing responses, as have been
described in the mammalian testis and pancreas36–38 (Fig. 6b). In this model, the

facultative stem cells that drive prostate regeneration could be independent from the stem
cells for prostate organogenesis, and might co-exist in the adult gland; such a dual
progenitor system functions during Drosophila tracheal remodeling39.
In addition, the observed defect in stem cell maintenance in Nkx3.1 mutants suggests a
functional role for Nkx3.1 expression in CARNs. Thus, Nkx3.1 inactivation might result in
increased differentiation of CARNs and expansion of a proliferative transit-amplifying
population (Supp. Fig. 9). This interpretation is consistent with the finding that the duration
of epithelial proliferation during prostate regeneration is prolonged in Nkx3.1 mutants
relative to wild-type40. The function of Nkx3.1 in stem cell maintenance may be direct,
consistent with its feedback loop with androgen receptor and role in prostate epithelial
differentiation20,41, or may be indirect, for example due to increased oxidative damage with
aging42.

Author Manuscript

Finally, the importance of the stem cell compartment as a target of oncogenic transformation
has been highlighted by studies showing that stem cell populations in lung and colon are
efficient cells of origin for cancer43,44. In the case of prostate cancer, the identification of a
castration-resistant stem cell population as a cell of origin also has implications for the onset
of hormone-refractory disease. Thus, if oncogenic transformation of CARNs can result in
the formation of a putative cancer stem cell, the eventual emergence of hormone-refractory
disease may be pre-figured through an initiating event during prostate carcinogenesis.

METHODS SUMMARY

Author Manuscript

The Nkx3.1CreERT2/+ allele was generated by gene targeting using standard techniques; the
Nkx3.1 null mutant mice have been previously described21. R26R-lacZ and Pten conditional
mutant mice were obtained from the Jackson Laboratory Induced Mutant Resource; the
R26R-YFP mice were provided by Dr. Frank Costantini. All lines were maintained on a
hybrid C57BL/6-129/Sv strain background.

Author Manuscript

Castration of adult male mice was performed using standard techniques. For tamoxifen
induction of Cre activity in mice containing Nkx3.1CreERT2/+, mice were administered 9
mg/40 g tamoxifen for 4 consecutive days. For prostate regeneration, physiological levels of
testosterone (1.875 µg/hr) were administered for four weeks by subcutaneous implantation
of mini-osmotic pumps (Alzet)45. When included, BrdU (100 mg/kg) was administered
once daily during the first three days of regeneration. For single-cell transplantation, single
YFP+ cells were isolated by mouth-pipetting under epifluorescence illumination from a
dissociated prostate cell suspension obtained from castrated and tamoxifen-induced
Nkx3.1CreERT2/+; R26R-YFP/+ mice. A single YFP+ cell (or YFP− cell as a control) was
recombined with 2.5 × 105 rat urogenital sinus mesenchyme cells in a 10 µl collagen pad,
followed by transplantation under the kidney capsule of nude mice and harvesting after 10–
12 weeks.
Cryosections were stained with primary antibodies as listed in Supp. Table 5, and
counterstained with TOPRO3 or DAPI (Invitrogen/Molecular Probes). Secondary antibodies
were labeled with Alexa Fluor 488 , 555, or 594 (Invitrogen/Molecular Probes).
Immunofluorescence staining was imaged using a Leica TCS5 spectral confocal microscope.

Cell counting was performed manually using confocal photomicrographs with at least three
animals for each experiment or genotype analyzed.

METHODS
Gene targeting and genotyping

Author Manuscript

The Nkx3.1CreERT2/+ allele was generated by gene targeting using standard techniques46.
The targeting vector was generated using a 5' arm corresponding to a 3.5 kb PCR fragment
from a Nkx3.1 genomic clone21 up to the translation initiation site of Nkx3.1, and a 3' arm
corresponding to a 4.0 kb PCR fragment of genomic sequence (Supp. Fig. 2a). The positive
selection cassette corresponded to the self-excising ACE-Cre/PolII-neo selection cassette
from the pACN vector47, while negative selection was provided by the PGK-tk cassette
from the pPNT vector48. Primers for generating the 5' arm were: 5'-ACC GGA ATT CTC
CGC TGC GCG CCG CTT TTG C-3' and 5'-ACC CAA GCT TCA TGC CTG CAG GTC
GGA GGC C-3'. Primers to amplify the 3' arm were: 5'-CTA GTC TAG AGC GGC TCA
CCT CCT TCC TCA-3' and 5'-CTA GTC TAG AGG ATG GCA GGA GAG GTC ACT
GC-3'. The gap between the 5' and 3' arms is approximately 80 bp, such that the 3' arm
contains the majority of exon 1 together with intron 1, exon 2, and 200 bp of genomic
sequence 3' of the transcription termination site. The pGS-CreERT2 vector28 was generously
provided by Pierre Chambon, and was modified by insertion of a 65 bp intron from ACECre47 between the PshAI and ClaI sites of the CreERT2 sequence. Culture and transfection
of mouse ES cells followed standard protocols46. Homologous recombinants in TC1 ES
cells49 were selected by positive-negative selection followed by Southern blot screening.
1/260 clones analyzed was properly targeted, and this clone was used to generate germline
chimeras.

Mouse genotyping
Genotyping for the Nkx3.1CreRT2 allele was performed by Southern blotting or by PCR using
tail genomic DNA. Primers for PCR genotyping were as follows: for the Nkx3.1 wild-type
allele, 5'-CTC CGC TAC CCT AAG CAT CC-3' and 5'-GAC ACT GTC ATA TTA CTT
GGA CC-3', which amplifies a region deleted in the targeting vector; and for the
Nkx3.1CreERT2 allele, 5'-CAG ATG GCG CGG CAA CAC C -3' and 5'-GCG CGG TCT
GGC AGT AAA AAC -3'.

Author Manuscript

The primers for genotyping Nkx3.1 mutant mice were: 5'-GCC AAC CTG CCT CAA TCA
CTA AGG-3' (wild-type Nkx3.1 forward), 5'-TTC CAC ATA CAC TTC ATT CTC AGT-3'
(mutated forward), and 5'-GCC AAC CTG CCT CAA TCA CTA AGG-3' (wild-type and
mutated reverse). The primers for genotyping the R26R-lacZ Cre-reporter were: 5’-CCG
CGC TGT ACT GGA GGC TGA AG -3’ (forward) and 5’-ATA CTG CAC CGG GCG
GGA AGG AT -3’ (reverse). Primers for genotyping the Pten conditional (Ptenflox) allele
were: 5'-ACT CAA GGC AGG GAT GAG C-3' (forward) and 5'-GTC ATC TTC ACT
TAG CCA TTG G-3' (reverse). Primers for genotyping the R26R-YFP mice were: 5'-GCG
AAG AGT TTG TCC TCA ACC-3' (mutated forward), 5'-GGA GCG GGA GAA ATG
GAT ATG-3' (wild-type forward) and 5'-AAA GTC GCT CTG AGT TGT TAT-3' (wildtype and mutated reverse).

Mouse procedures

Author Manuscript

Castration of adult male mice was performed using standard techniques50. Following
castration at 8 weeks of age, mice were allowed to regress for four weeks to reach the fully
involuted state. For tamoxifen induction of Cre activity in mice containing the
Nkx3.1CreERT2 allele, mice were administered 9 mg/40 g tamoxifen (Sigma) suspended in
corn oil, or vehicle alone for negative controls, by i.p. injection or oral gavage once daily for
4 consecutive days, followed by a chase period of 14 days.

Author Manuscript

For prostate regeneration, testosterone (Sigma) was dissolved at 25 mg/ml in 100% ethanol
and diluted in PEG-400 to a final concentration of 7.5 mg/ml. Testosterone was
administered for four weeks at a rate of 1.875 µg per hour delivered by subcutaneous
implantation of mini-osmotic pumps (Alzet); this regimen yields physiological levels of
serum testosterone45. When included, BrdU (100 mg/kg) (Sigma) was also administered by
i.p. injection once daily during the first three days of regeneration to label proliferating cells.
After regeneration of the prostate, mice could be euthanized for analysis, or deprived of
androgens by pump removal, returning to the regressed state after four additional weeks. At
this point, mice were either euthanized for analysis, or osmotic pumps could be reimplanted
for additional rounds of serial regression/regeneration.

Author Manuscript

For tissue recombination and renal grafting, prostate tissues (corresponding to the combined
anterior, dorsolateral, and ventral lobes) were dissected and minced to small clumps,
followed by enzymatic dissociation with 0.2% collagenase I (Invitrogen) in DMEM media
with 10% fetal bovine serum for 90 min. Dissociated tissue was passed sequentially through
21, 23 and 26 gauge needles followed by a 40 µm cell strainer to obtain single-cell
suspensions. The resulting cells were assessed for viability by trypan blue exclusion and
counted. For grafts containing large numbers of epithelial cells, as in Supp. Fig. 4, 2.5 × 105
dissociated prostate cells obtained from castrated and tamoxifen-induced Nkx3.1CreERT2/+;
R26R-YFP/+ mice were mixed with 2.5 × 105 dissociated urogenital sinus mesenchyme
(UGM) cells from E18.0 rat embryos. UGM cells were obtained from dissected urogenital
sinus that was treated for 30 min in 1% trypsin, followed by mechanical dissociation and
treatment with 0.1% collagenase B (Roche) for 30 min at 37°, and washing in PBS. Pelleted
cell mixtures were resuspended in 10 µl of 1:5 collagen:setting buffer (10x Earle’s Balanced
Salt Solution (Life Technologies), 0.2 M NaHCO3, 50 mM NaOH), and gelatinized in 37°C
for 20 minutes. Tissue recombinants were cultured in DMEM media with 10% fetal bovine
serum supplemented with 10−7 M dihydrotestosterone (DHT) overnight, followed by
transplantation under the kidney capsules of nude mice. Grafts were harvested after 4–8
weeks of growth for analysis.

Author Manuscript

For single-cell grafts, as in Fig. 3, a single YFP+ (or YFP− cell as a control) was isolated
from the dissociated cell suspension from castrated and tamoxifen-induced Nkx3.1CreERT2/+;
R26R-YFP/+ prostates by mouth-pipetting under epifluorescence illumination on an
Olympus IX51 inverted microscope with DP71 camera. This single cell was then
recombined with 2.5 × 105 dissociated urogenital sinus mesenchyme cells obtained from
E18.0 rat embryos, and cultured and grafted as above. Grafts were harvested after 10–12
weeks of growth for analysis, and imaged under epifluorescence on an Olympus SZX16

stereomicroscope with DP71 camera. The resulting graft tissue was analyzed for YFP and
other marker expression as described below, and counterstained with DAPI for visualization
of nuclear morphology at high-power to distinguish mouse from rat nuclei31.

Author Manuscript

Grafts recovered from transplantation of a single lineage-marked YFP+ cell (n=16/43, 37%)
were confirmed to be of mouse origin by YFP expression and nuclear morphology (Supp.
Fig. 6), while the single graft (n=1/31, 3%) arising from a YFP− cell was confirmed to be of
mouse origin by nuclear morphology. Generation of prostatic ducts by a YFP− cell might
result from a CARN that was not lineage-marked by tamoxifen-induction, which is
inefficient, or alternatively from a distinct stem cell type in the prostate epithelium. We note
that a significant percentage (n=13/74, 18%) of the grafts contained ducts of rat origin,
which are not included in Fig. 3j. These rat ducts likely arise from rat urogenital epithelial
cells that are difficult to completely dissociate from the urogenital mesenchyme used in the
graft, and can populate the graft under conditions in which the epithelial contribution is
limiting.
For histological and immunofluorescence analysis, individual prostate lobes or renal grafts
were dissected, and then fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for subsequent cryoembedding in
OCT compound (Sakura), or fixed in 10% formalin followed by paraffin embedding.
Volume of dissected anterior prostate lobes was determined by physical displacement of
known volumes of PBS solution in 0.5 ml centrifuge tubes.
Histology and immunostaining

Author Manuscript

Hematoxylin-eosin staining was performed using standard protocols on 6 µm paraffin
sections. β-galactosidase staining was performed using 12 micron cryosections, which were
incubated in staining solution (0.1 M PBS, 1.3 mM MgCl2, 1 mg/ml X-gal , 0.02% Nonidet
P–40, 5 mM K4Fe(CN)6, 5 mM K3Fe(CN)6, and 0.01% Na-deoxycholate) for 3 hours or
overnight, followed by fixation in 10% formalin for 2 to 5 hours. Direct visualization of
YFP was performed after washing 10 µm cryosections in PBST (PBS with 0.1% Triton
X-100) 3 times, incubation with TOPRO3 (1:1000 diluted in PBST) (Invitrogen/Molecular
Probes) for 30 min, and mounting with VECTASHIELD mounting medium (Vector Labs),
which contains DAPI.

Author Manuscript

For immunohistochemical staining, 6 µm paraffin sections were deparaffinized in xylene,
followed by antigen retrieval through boiling in antigen unmasking solution (Vector Labs).
Slides were blocked in 10% normal serum or with blocking reagents provided in the M.O.M.
kit (Vector Labs) for mouse primary antibodies, then incubated with primary antibodies
overnight at 4 °C or room temperature. Primary antibodies and dilutions utilized are listed in
Supp. Table 5. Secondary antibodies were obtained from Vectastain ABC kits (Vector Labs)
and diluted 1:250 or 1:500. The signal was enhanced using the Vectastain ABC system and
visualized with the NovaRed Substrate Kit (Vector Labs). The slides were counterstained
with Harris Modified Hematoxylin (1:4 diluted in H2O) (Fisher Scientific) and mounted
with Clearmount (American Master*Tech Scientific). Immunohistochemical staining was
imaged using a Nikon Eclipse E800 microscope equipped with a Nikon DXM1200 digital
camera.

Immunofluorescence staining was performed on either 6 micron paraffin sections or 10
micron cryosections, which were incubated in 3% H2O2 and Antigen Unmasking Solution
(Vector Labs). Primary antibodies and dilutions utilized are listed in Supp. Table 5. Slides
were incubated with 10% normal goat (Vector Labs) or donkey serum (Sigma) and with
primary antibodies diluted in the 10% normal goat or donkey serum overnight at 4°C or
room temperature. Slides then were incubated with secondary antibodies (diluted 1:500 in
PBST) labeled with Alexa Fluor 488, 555, or 594 (Invitrogen/Molecular Probes). Detection
of Nkx3.1, GFP, and Cre was enhanced using tyramide amplification (Invitrogen/Molecular
Probes) by incubation of slides with HRP-conjugated secondary antibody (1:100 dilution)
(Invitrogen/Molecular Probes), followed by incubation with tyramide 488 or 555 for 6 min.
Sections were counterstained with TOPRO3 or TOTO3 (diluted 1:1000 in PBST)
(Invitrogen/Molecular Probes) to visualize nuclei, and mounted with VECTASHIELD
mounting medium (Vector Labs), which contains DAPI. Immunofluorescence staining was
imaged using a Leica TCS5 spectral confocal microscope.
Quantitation and statistics

Author Manuscript

To calculate the number of CARNs in the regressed mouse prostate, we determined that
there are an average of 112,000 total cells (n=5 animals; all lobes combined), of which 59%
are epithelial as determined by immunoreactivity for the pan-epithelial marker CD24 (ref.
9). Since 0.7% of epithelial cells in the regressed prostate are CARNs, there are
approximately 460 CARNs in the total prostate. To determine the number of lineage-marked
cells in the regressed prostate, we visualized 320 live YFP+ cells in dissociated prostate
tissue (all lobes combined) from 5 castrated lineage-marked Nkx3.1CreERT2/+; R26R-YFP/+
mice, for a total of 64 YFP+ live cells/mouse. For the experiment in Supp. Fig. 4, we
performed 2 recombinations from these dissociated prostate cells, so that there were
approximately 160 live YFP+ cells used in each graft.
For immunostaining experiments, cell numbers were counted manually using confocal 40x
and 63x photomicrographs. Statistical analyses were performed using a two-sample T-test,
X2 test, or Fisher’s Exact test as appropriate. At least three animals for each experiment or
genotype were analyzed.

Figure 6. Possible lineage relationships in the prostate epithelium

a, Independent stem cells for basal and luminal epithelium may give rise to differentiated
cell types through multipotent progenitors (MPP) and transit-amplifying progenitors, with
some bipotentiality (dashed arrows). In this model, CARNs would correspond to the luminal
stem cells. b, Alternatively, stem cells for prostate organogenesis may be basal, but luminal
transit-amplifying cells, including CARNs, can acquire stem cell properties during
regeneration (red arrows), thus acting as facultative or “potential” stem cells.
