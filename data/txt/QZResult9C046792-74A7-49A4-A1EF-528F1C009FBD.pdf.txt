Progression-Free Survival: Does a Correlation With Survival
Justify Its Role as a Surrogate Clinical Endpoint?
Andreas Becker, MD1,2; Christian Eichelberg, MD1; and Maxine Sun, BS3

After achieving a better understanding of the vascular endothelial growth factor and mammalian target of rapamycin
pathways, the treatment of patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC) using targeted therapies has undergone tremendous improvement since the cytokine era,1 in which to date, 7 molecules (sunitinib,2,3 sorafenib,4 bevacizumab,5-8 temsirolimus,9 everolimus,10 pazopanib,11,12 and axitinib,13,14) have been approved by the US Food and
Drug Administration (FDA). It is interesting to note that of those, only temsirolimus and, in subanalyses, sunitinib
demonstrated improved overall survival (OS) compared with established therapies or placebo. All other trials demonstrated an improvement in progression-free survival (PFS) only, without a corresponding improvement in OS (Table
1).2-14
Recently, an increasing number of clinical trials not limited to metastatic kidney cancer have focused on PFS as the
primary endpoint instead of the previously established standard clinical endpoint of OS.15-18 In fact, according to a review
of anticancer drugs approved by the FDA, approximately 23% of all new approvals between 2005 and 2007 were based
on randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that focused on PFS or time to disease progression instead of OS.19 In this context, many believed that the oncology community was demonstrating a tendency toward accepting a delay in disease progression as a laudable objective, notwithstanding an increase in survival. In this sense, many investigators sought to
evaluate whether PFS may represent a viable surrogate endpoint of OS. Although this postulation has been largely examined in other solid tumors,15-18 to the best of our knowledge it remains poorly explored within the context of mRCC. Currently, to our knowledge only 1 other study conducted by Heng et al tested this hypothesis, although it relied on a
retrospective series of nonrandomized patients.20
To circumvent the paucity of data and the nature of the database used, Halabi et al, in the current issue of Cancer, used data originating from 2 phase 3 RCTs to test the correlation between PFS and OS, with the aim of assessing
whether PFS may represent a valid surrogate endpoint in patients with mRCC who are treated with bevacizumab in
combination with interferon-a.21 Specifically, data from the Cancer and Leukemia Group B (CALGB) 90206 trial5
served as the training set for their analyses (n 5 732 patients), whereas data from the Avastin for Renal Cell Cancer
(AVOREN) trial6 served as the testing set (n 5 649 patients). The authors computed disease progression at 3 months
and 6 months as a binary variable in proportional hazards models for the prediction of OS. Moreover, concordance
between PFS and OS was tested using the Kendalls’ tau, in which a value of 1.0 would mean a perfect correlation,
whereas a value of 0.0 would indicate that PFS and OS are completely independent. Results from the training set
demonstrated that the hazards ratio (HR) for mortality was 2.6 (95% confidence interval, 2.1-3.1) and 2.8 (95%
confidence interval, 2.3-3.4), respectively, for patients who experienced disease progression at 3 months and 6
months compared with those who did not (both P < .001). HRs in the testing set revealed a similar effect. Finally,
the estimated Kendalls’ tau was 0.53 and 0.50, respectively, for the training and testing sets. Based on their findings,
Halabi et al arguably concluded that, at least among patients treated with bevacizumab plus interferon-a, PFS may
be considered an appropriate surrogate endpoint for OS.21
Certainly, there are many advantages and reasons to advocate the use of PFS as a surrogate endpoint for OS. First,
the evaluation of OS requires a large study cohort and a lengthy follow-up, which may often be impractical given the

economic and timeframe burdens of clinical trials.
Instead, disease progression and time to disease progression occur more frequently and are easy to measure,
thereby salvaging the limitations associated with OS.
Second, the most cited issue related to the lack of an
increase in OS is the influence of postprogression therapy, in which many patients with mRCC treated in the
control arms of RCTs eventually cross over to the experimental arm or are contaminated by second-line or
third-line drugs in the same drug category. Crossover
after disease progression from the control arm of an
RCT is ethically necessary when the experimental arm
demonstrates clinical activity. However, allowance for
crossover may compromise the ability to assess a difference in OS.22 For example, in the RCT comparing
everolimus versus placebo in patients with mRCC who
had previously developed disease progression while
receiving at least 1 targeted therapy, the authors
reported an observed HR for PFS of 0.3 in favor of
everolimus.23 However, approximately 80% of patients
allocated placebo received everolimus, which likely
resulted in a lack of detectable OS benefit between the
2 groups (median OS, 14.8 months vs 14.4 months;
P 5 .162). Similarly, given that many alternative
second-line, third-line, and even subsequent lines of
treatment are available for the treatment of mRCC, it
becomes even further improbable that an improved
PFS will result in an OS benefit, even when study
designs do not allow crossover.22,24 Such contamination has been reported to be as high as 59%.2,5

Despite the aforementioned arguments in favor of
using PFS as a surrogate endpoint for OS, most investigators and health policy decision-makers remain apprehensive of such an option; only recently, approval of
the vascular endothelial growth factor receptor tyrosine
kinase inhibitor tivozanib was denied by the FDA,
although tivozanib demonstrated a significant advantage in PFS of nearly 3 months compared with sorafenib. The results of the TIVO-1 trial (Tivozanib Versus
Sorafenib in first line Advanced RCC) were presented
at the 2013 American Society of Clinical Oncology
Genitourinary Cancers Symposium.25 Surprisingly, despite the advantage in considering PFS as the primary
endpoint, patients treated with tivozanib were found to
have a slightly shorter OS (28.8 months vs 29.3 months
in the sorafenib arm; P 5 .1). This discrepancy emphasizes the importance of the validation of potential surrogate endpoints, such as PFS, before its use (eg, a
meta-analysis). Such validation needs to satisfy 2 simultaneous conditions26: 1) the surrogate must be correlated with the clinical endpoint (in this case, OS); and
2) the surrogate must fully capture the net effect of the
intervention on the endpoint of clinical efficacy. Both
Halabi et al21 and Heng et al20 have reported on what
appears to be an unequivocal correlation between PFS
and OS, therefore satisfying the first condition. However, to the best of our knowledge, the second condition
has yet to be tested in patients with mRCC, and is conceptually more difficult to assess.26 An easy example in
the urology setting would be levels of prostate-specific

antigen. The latter is clearly correlated with the level of
disease, which is great for early detection and prognosis,
but unreliable for predicting the net benefit of any
intervention. As such, although PFS may be fundamentally associated with OS, can it accurately predict OS?
A recurring question remains as to why do agents
that increase PFS fail to improve survival? Some authors
have suggested that PFS is more likely to be affected by
evaluation and attribution biases, as well as measurement
errors,27 which makes it easily detectable but less specific.
Indeed, unlike OS, the assessment of disease progression
is at a higher risk of false-positive results.28 Precisely, disease progression, originally developed to describe a change
in tumor burden,29 was intended to provide preliminary
activity of the tumor during phase 2 trials. The fact that
many clinical trials are now designed to measure disease
progression as a time-to-event endpoint15-18 does not
render it a reliable endpoint that is sufficiently adequate
to capture a clinically meaningful benefit. This is particularly worrisome if the motivation to consider PFS as a surrogate endpoint is partly driven by the pharmaceutical
industry, in which, given the lower costs and shorter time
frame, such agents are allowed to be declared active when
the actual benefit is not observable.
As we progress toward measures against mRCC, the
studies of both Halabi et al21 and Heng et al20 provide
perceptive affirmation that disease progression or time to
disease progression are fundamentally associated with OS.
However, the mere association is not enough to justify its
consideration as a surrogate endpoint that is significant
for the patient, for whom the term “meaningful” should
ultimately convey benefit. Moreover, because only 49%
of all patients in the CALGB trial received secondary
treatments, the association between PFS and OS needs to
be confirmed in contemporary patients who are typically
receiving a sequential therapy of multiple biologically
active agents. A rigorous evaluation of this topic is needed
before PFS can be reliably considered to be a valid surrogate endpoint of OS in patients with mRCC.
