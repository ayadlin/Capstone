Abstract
Cellular survival from radiation-induced DNA damage
requires access to sites of damage for the assembly of repair
complexes and the subsequent repair, particularly the repair
of DNA double strand breaks (DSB). Hyperthermia causes
changes in protein-protein/DNA interactions in the nucleus
that block access to sites of DNA damage. Studies presented
here indicate that the nucleolar protein, nucleophosmin (NPM),
redistributes from the nucleolus following hyperthermia,
increases its association with DNA, and blocks access to DNA
DSBs. Reduction of NPM significantly reduces heat-induced
radiosensitization, but reduced NPM level does not alter radiation sensitivity per se. NPM knockdown reduces heat-induced
inhibition of DNA DSB repair. Also, these results suggest that
NPM associates with nuclear matrix attachment region DNA
in heat-shocked cells. [Cancer Res 2009;69(16):6454–62]

Introduction
The potential for using hyperthermia as a radiosensitizing
adjuvant for radiation therapy has long been recognized. Recent
meta-analysis shows that hyperthermia significantly improves
radiation therapy (1). Furthermore, hyperthermia is a potent
radiosensitizer, producing thermal enhancement ratios (TER) from
3 to 5 (1, 2). Nevertheless, its clinical use remains limited, in part,
because the mechanism of hyperthermia induced radiosensitization remains poorly understood. Reasonably, inhibition of DNA
double strand break (DSB) repair should be involved in heatinduced radiosensitization. However, the literature indicates a
more complex situation. Cells defective in the nonhomologous
end-joining pathway or in homologous recombination show similar
TERs but are more radiosensitive than isogenic wild-type cells (2).
One interpretation of these results is that neither of these pathways
is a critical target for heat-induced radiosensitization. However,
because the mutants studied are defective in the effector mechanisms of these pathways, an alternative interpretation is that
hyperthermia affects an upstream step such as the sensing of DNA
damage, which would impact both DNA DSB repair pathways. One
explanation (3–6) suggests that masking of DNA strand breaks by
heat-induced protein-DNA complexes would sterically inhibit
access of the sensing proteins to the damage site. However, little
work has been done toward determining what protein(s) are
involved in DNA damage masking and the DNA regions masked in
heat shocked cells. Here, we present evidence that heat-induced

masking of DNA damage is due (in part) to the heat-induced
association of the nucleolar protein, nucleophosmin (NPM) with
matrix attachment region (MAR) DNA.
NPM is an abundant phosphoprotein, localized to the granular
regions of the nucleolus (7). NPM trafficking contributes to its
essential functions (8). Thus, changing the ability of NPM to
mobilize to distinct cellular locales should alter NPM function (8).
Additionally, loss of NPM function results in attenuation of cellular
proliferation and increased apoptosis (9–16). The nucleolus acts as
repository of stress responsive proteins (17–20). Specifically, the
nucleolar protein, nucleolin (NCL or C23), redistributes from the
nucleolus and interacts with replication protein A, resulting in
inhibition of DNA synthesis (20–22). The nucleolus is a heatsensitive organelle, undergoing detectable changes after 1 hour
at 41jC and general changes after 15 min at 42jC, which leave
cytoplasmic organelles largely unaffected (23–25). Furthermore,
HSP70 and HSP110, which modulate heat-induced radiosensitization, localize in the nucleolus in cells during and immediately after
heat shock (26, 27). Therefore, we determined if NPM could play
a key role in heat radiosensitization.

Materials and Methods
Cell lines and cell culture. HeLaS3 cells (American Type Culture
Collection) were maintained in a-MEM media with 10% calf serum, 100 U/mL
penicillin, and 100 mg/mL streptomycin. Human breast cancer cells,
HCC1806, were maintained in RPMI 1640 with 10% Bovine Growth Serum
and antibiotics. For survival experiments, control and treated cells were
plated in replicate T-25 flasks. After 10 d (HeLaS3) or 19 d (HCC1806), flasks
were stained with Crystal Violet and viable colonies (>50 cells) counted.
Hyperthermia and irradiation. For acute hyperthermia, flasks were
immersed in a temperature-controlled water bath. Irradiation was performed using a PANTAK pmc1000 X-ray machine with a 0.1 Cu+ 2.5 AL filter
at a dose rate of 88.7 cGy/min.
Transfection with siRNA. HeLaS3 cell transfections were accomplished
using a Nucleofector II electroporation apparatus (Amaxa) following the
manufacturer’s instructions. NPM-specific siRNA sequences (28) and
siCONTROL Non-Targeting siRNA #1 were obtained from Dharmacon.
Green fluorescent protein (GFP)-NPM (29) images were captured with a
Spot Pursuit digital camera (Diagnostic Instruments) on an Olympus
fluorescent microscope.
Assay for DSBs. The Neutral Comet Assay was performed using the
Comet Assay kit from Trevigen following manufacturer’s instructions. Proteinase K (Sigma), when used, was added to the lysis solution (0.27 U/mL).
Lysis occurred at 4jC for 30 min. Comets were analyzed by CometScore
software (TriTek).
Assay for DNA supercoiling ability. The halo assay was done as
described by VanderWaal and colleagues (30).
Chromatin immunoprecipitation assay. The enzymatic shearing
Chip-IT kit (Active Motif) was used following the manufacturer’s instructions. NPM was immunoprecipitated with mouse anti-NPM antibodies
(Zymed Invitrogen). Coimmunoprecipitated DNA fragments were PCR
amplified using primers to Topoisomerase I; MAR II, Exon 13, Exon 20; and

c-jun and the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) promoters (31).
Immunoblots, antibodies, and other reagents. SDS-PAGE and
immunoblotting were done following standard procedures using a BioRad Mini-Protean II gel and blotting system. Immunoblots were probed
with mouse anti-NPM or HSP70/HSC70 antibodies and alkaline phosphatase conjugated Affinipure Goat anti-Mouse IgG+IgM secondary antibodies.
The targeted bands were visualized colorimetrically by 5-bromo-4-chloro-3indolyl phosphate/nitroblue tetrazolium.

Results
To confirm that heat increased NPM-DNA binding, we crosslinked DNA-associated proteins to DNA with cisplatin, then
isolated the DNA with hydroxyapatite (5), and resolved the DNAassociated proteins by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis.
Hyperthermia increased the DNA association of NPM isoform,
B23.1, >6-fold. Several NPM isoforms became associated with DNA
in heated cells (Fig. 1A). These results are consistent with previous reports showing that hyperthermia increases NPM association with DNA in vivo (5) and binds DNA in vitro (32).
To determine the effects of hyperthermia on the subnuclear
localization of NPM, we exposed HeLaS3 cells and HCC1806 cells
to increasing heat shocks and visualized the localization of NPM
using fluorescently labeled antibodies or transiently expressed
GFP-tagged NPM fusion protein. NPM readily relocalizes from the
nucleolus to the nucleoplasm after heat shocks of 15 to 45 min at
45jC in HeLaS3 and HCC1806 cells (Fig. 1). Thus, NPM redistributes into the nucleoplasm after hyperthermia and becomes
associated with DNA.
Because NPM becomes associated with DNA, we determined if
NPM could be involved in radiation sensitivity. We measured the
TER after a 90% to 95% NPM knockdown, using siRNA. Cells were
X-irradiated with or without prior hyperthermia (30 minutes at
45jC) and their colony-forming ability measured (Fig. 2A). For
HeLaS3 and HCC1806 cells, TER values were calculated at the
control survival level after 2 and 4 Gy, which were chosen because
these doses are commonly used in clinical radiation therapy and
averaged. Hyperthermia significantly increased the nontransfected
cell’s sensitivity to X-rays, TER of 2.22 and 2.08 for HeLaS3 and
HCC1806, respectively (Fig. 2D). Transfection with the nonspecific
siRNA did not significantly change the TER (2.22 and 2.16).
However, transfection with the siRNA specific for NPM significantly
lowered the TER to 1.74 and 1.39 (P < 0.05; Students t test) in
HeLaS3 and HCC1806 cells, respectively. Also, NPM reduction
made a statistically significant increase in survival at each dose
level by the Student’s t test. Thus, heat-induced radiosensitization
is due, in part, to the presence of NPM. Without heat shock, NPM
knockdown had no effect on survival after 2, 4, or 6 Gy (Fig. 2A).
Transient NPM knockdown or transfection with a nonspecific
siRNA did not significantly alter the plating efficiency in HeLaS3
cells (80 F 3%) or in HCC1806 cells (30 F 3%). However, NPM
knockdown sensitized HeLaS3 cells to heat shock alone. To
understand this observation, we measured HSC70/HSP70 levels.
NPM knockdown reduced the endogenous levels of HSC70/HSP70
(Fig. 2C), which confers resistance to heat-induced cell killing
(33, 34). This result also supports the hypothesis that NPM
specifically contributes to heat-induced radiosensitization; because
its knockdown increased thermal sensitivity while reducing the
TER without affecting radiation sensitivity per se. In contrast,
nonspecific thermal sensitizers and protectors have been shown to
alter both heat sensitivity and the TER in concert (35).

Nucleophosmin Redistribution Following Heat Shock

DNA damage immediately after 8 Gy was the same between cells
heated at 45jC for 30 minutes and unheated. However, a significant
inhibition of subsequent DNA DSB repair could be observed
(Fig. 3A, left). In control cells, 75% of the DNA DSBs were repaired
after 90 minutes, but in heated cells, only 20% to 25% was repaired.
After 150 minutes, >90% of the DNA DSBs were repaired in unheated cells, whereas f50% remained unrepaired in the heated
cells. In the absence of PK, there is a 60% reduction in the
measured comet moment (Fig. 3A, right) for cells, heated at 45jC
for 30 minutes, compared with unheated cells. Because the comet
moment is the same in heated versus nonheated cells in the
presence of PK, we conclude that 60% of the DNA DSBs, following
8 Gy, are masked (Fig. 3A, right), by a heat-induced, PK digestible
component, i.e., a protein or proteins. We define masking as the
inability of an assay (or DNA repair pathway) to detect DNA
damage in the presence of protein-DNA interactions, although the
damage would be detectable in the absence of such protein-DNA
interactions. Without PK, there seemed to be no repair of DNA DSB
for 150 minutes (Fig. 3A, left), which may be due to a combination
of unmasking the DSBs and their subsequent repair.
We determined the effects of NPM knockdown on the heatinduced masking of DNA damage and repair inhibition. The
masking of DNA DSB is reduced by 40% in cells treated with the
NPM siRNA (Fig. 3B, right). To illustrate the effects of NPM knockdown on the masking of DNA damage, the comet moment values

immediately after irradiation are plotted (Fig. 3C). Hyperthermia
reduced the post–8 Gy comet moment f3-fold. The comet moment was reduced f2-fold after NPM knockdown (P < 0.05).
Heated NPM knockdown cells, 90 minutes after 8 Gy, had 22% of
the initial DNA DSB remaining for a 5-fold reduction in repair
inhibition. Furthermore, the residual unrepaired DSB was reduced
from 50% unrepaired to 12% unrepaired. Unrepaired DSBs are
critical in hyperthermic radiosensitization (36, 37). In contrast, in
cells treated with a nonsense siRNA, the heat-induced masking of
DNA DSB and inhibition of their repair were identical to the untreated control (Fig. 3B, right). Without heat shock, NPM knockdown had no effect on DNA DSB repair (Fig. 3B, left) consistent
with the observation that NPM knockdown had no effect on radiosensitivity in the absence of heat shock.
Previous studies of the masking effect using the halo assay, a
DNA supercoiling assay that depends on DNA-nuclear matrix
anchoring (38) found that it correlated with the TER in cell lines
having various levels of resistance to heat-induced radiosensitization (39). Therefore, we determined the effects of NPM on DNA
damage masking using this assay. In the halo assay, DNA supercoil
unwinding/rewinding is driven by increasing the concentration of
the intercalating dye, propidium iodide. DNA strand breaks
induced by ionizing radiation inhibit the ability of the loops to
rewind supercoils in a dose-dependent manner (40). The inability
of DNA loops to be rewound is quantified as the difference between

rewinding in the absence versus the presence of DNA damage
(38, 40). This difference called the excess halo diameter (EHD) is
estimated for propidium iodide concentrations between 10 and
50 Ag/mL (38). When cells are heated before irradiation, the EHD is
reduced, although the amount of DNA damage per cell or per unit
of DNA remains the same (4). Cells were untreated, irradiated with
10 Gy, or heat shocked for 30 minutes at 45jC and then irradiated
with 10 Gy before running the halo assay (Fig. 4A). Cells with
normal NPM levels showed a typical heat-induced reduction in the
inhibition of DNA supercoil rewinding following irradiation. In
contrast, in cells with reduced NPM protein levels, hyperthermia
had minimal effect on DNA supercoil rewinding after irradiation.
Thus, the masking of DNA damage, as detected by the halo assay, is
reduced in cells with 80% to 90% lower NPM protein levels,
suggesting that NPM plays a significant role in masking of damage
when detected by the halo assay. The EHD (calculated as described
above; Fig. 4B) for heated and irradiated cells with normal NPM
levels was significantly reduced compared with radiation alone.
In contrast, the heat-induced reduction of EHD, when NPM was
knocked down, was f80% less than that for normal NPM levels
(Fig. 4B). Similar results were obtained in HCC1806 cells (Fig. 4C).
In summary, a significant fraction (80%) of the masking effect,
detected by the halo assay, depends on the presence of NPM.
We used the chromatin immunoprecipitation assay to determine
if NPM is associated with MAR, exon, or promoter DNA. NPM was
immunoprecipitated with a NPM-specific antibody from heated
and control cells and the associated DNA analyzed by PCR using
primers specific for MAR DNA, promoter DNA, and exon DNA (31).
Detection of specific DNA sequences (Fig. 5A) showed that NPM
is associated with Topo I-MAR1, which increased >3-fold following hyperthermia (Fig. 5A and C). There seemed to be no association between NPM and the promoter DNA of c-jun or GAPDH, nor
to Topo I exons 13 and 20 (Fig. 5C and D). Thus, only MAR DNA
sequences were amplified by the PCR reactions on the DNA that
coprecipitated with NPM, suggesting (albeit with limited sample
size) that NPM binds MAR DNA, but not promoter or exon DNA.
Furthermore, the enhanced association between NPM and MAR
DNA was reversed in a time-dependent manner during post–heat
incubation (Fig. 5D), typical for post–heat recovery from the masking effect (5). Because the ability to rewind DNA supercoils
depends upon DNA-nuclear matrix anchoring, the association of
NPM with MAR DNA is consistent with the observation that the
masking effect detected by the halo assay depends on NPM.

Discussion
Here, we show that heat-induced NPM redistribution and DNA
association contributes to the radiosensitization of cells because
multiple radiation sensitivity–related end points (i.e., TER,
inhibition of DSB repair and reduction of the EHD) are modulated
in heated cells after NPM knockdown. The results also indicate
that in heated cells, NPM associates with MAR DNA, shown by

modulation of the masking effect and the increased association of
MAR DNA sequences with NPM. A model illustrating the effect
of masking on DNA supercoil rewinding and the masking of DSBs
is shown in Fig. 6. The hypothesized effects of DSB masking
on downstream pathways and end points are illustrated in C,
assuming that if DNA damage is masked from a particular assay,
then that damage will also be masked from (at least some of) the
sensor steps in DNA repair. This assumption is supported by the
observation that the duration of the initial DSB repair inhibition,
90 minutes, measured in the presence of PK corresponded to
the duration of masking (reported previously, ref. 6) and the
association of the TOPO I MAR with NPM.
It has been proposed that the nucleolus can act as repository of
regulatory proteins that are released as needed in response to
stress (17–19). Recent reports show that NPM binds chromatin in
response to DNA double-strand breaks (41, 42). These results
suggest the importance of the nucleolus in modulating the cell’s
response to stress. The current work further supports the
hypothesis that the nucleolus is a key element in the response
to stress conditions by showing a role for NPM redistribution in
heat-induced radiosensitization.
Because most clinical hyperthermia delivers 41jC to 42jC
temperatures, and NPM redistribution is induced by 45jC, the NPM
radiosensitizing mechanism is not contributing to the TER
achieved by current clinical hyperthermia. Therefore, if the thermal
effectiveness of a given heat exposure could be enhanced to induce
NPM redistribution and DNA association, then a significant increase in TER would be expected. Thus, NPM redistribution and
DNA association will be an excellent target for the development
of thermal enhancing agents, reported previously (43, 44).
In summary, after heat shock the nucleolar protein, NPM or B23
relocalizes from the nucleolus into the nucleoplasm, increasing its
association with MAR DNA, masks a fraction of X-ray induced DNA
damage including DSB, inhibits their repair, and contributes to
heat-induced radiosensitization in two cell lines. This observation
builds on previous reports that suggest the nucleolus is a repository
of stress-responsive proteins. Thus, NPM redistribution and MAR
DNA binding should make a reasonable target for enhancing
radiosensitization via thermal enhancers or mimetics.
