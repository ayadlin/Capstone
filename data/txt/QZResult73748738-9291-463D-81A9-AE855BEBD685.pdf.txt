Abstract
Targeted expression of MYCN to the neural crest [under
control of the rat tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) promoter] causes
neuroblastoma in transgenic mice (TH-MYCN) and is a wellestablished model for this disease. Because high levels of
MYCN are associated with enhanced tumor angiogenesis and
poor clinical outcome in neuroblastoma, we serially characterized malignant progression, angiogenesis, and sensitivity to
angiogenic blockade in tumors from these animals. Tumor
cells were proliferative, secreted high levels of the angiogenic
ligand vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and
recruited a complex vasculature expressing the angiogenic
markers VEGF-R2, A-SMA, and matrix metalloproteinases
MMP-2 and MMP-9, all of which are also expressed in human
disease. Treatment of established murine tumors with the
angiogenesis inhibitor TNP-470 caused near-complete ablation, with reduced proliferation, enhanced apoptosis, and
vasculature disruption. Because TNP-470 has been associated
with neurotoxicity, we tested the recently described watersoluble HPMA copolymer–TNP-470 conjugate (caplostatin),
which showed comparable efficacy and was well tolerated
without weight loss or neurotoxicity as measured by rotarod
testing. This study highlights the importance of angiogenesis
inhibition in a spontaneous murine tumor with native tumor–
microenvironment interactions, validates the use of mice
transgenic for TH-MYCN as a model for therapy in this
common pediatric tumor, and supports further clinical
development of caplostatin as an antiangiogenic therapy in
childhood neuroblastoma. [Cancer Res 2007;67(19):9435–42]

Introduction
Neuroblastoma is the most common extracranial solid tumor of
childhood (1, 2). Approximately one third of tumors show
amplification of MYCN, a genetic abnormality closely associated
with poor outcome (1). High-risk tumors amplified for MYCN
typically show a paucity of stromal elements, compared with
tumors diploid for MYCN, which are stroma rich and less

aggressive (1, 3). Although these observations suggest that cells
in the microenvironment influence the behavior of transformed
neuroblasts, the factors contributing to this process in neuroblastoma remain poorly understood.
The acquisition of tumor-derived vasculature is a critical
example of tumor-microenvironment interactions in cancer (4).
Potential mechanisms through which neuroblast-specific expression of MYCN induces angiogenesis in the surrounding microenvironment include activation of vascular endothelial growth factor
(VEGF) and the proangiogenic matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2)
and repression of the angiogenesis inhibitors thrombospondin,
activin-A, and angiopoietin, all of which act on endothelial cells
(5–12). These observations suggest that neuroblasts in this embryonal tumor signal to the microenvironment to promote angiogenesis, that Mycn protein itself is critical to angiogenesis in the subset
of high-risk tumors that show amplification of MYCN, and that
relevant models of tumor-microenvironment interactions are
needed to test targeted therapy in general and antiangiogenic
therapies in particular in this disease.
We previously generated a model for high-risk, MYCN-amplified
neuroblastoma by directing expression of MYCN to the peripheral
neural crest of transgenic mice under control of the rat tyrosine
hydroxylase (TH) promoter (13). Mice transgenic for TH-MYCN in
the 129/SvJ background develop tumors in peripheral neural crestderived structures and show the typical histopathologic features of
human neuroblastoma. Genome-wide screens of tumor tissue
revealed localized gains of mouse chromosome 11 (orthologous to
gains on human chromosome 17q commonly observed in human
tumors), clustered loss of chromosomes 5, 9, and 16 (syntenic to an
analogous clustered loss of chromosomes 3p, 4p, and 11q in human
tumors), and amplification of the TH-MYCN transgene (14–16).
Significantly, these mice replicate the microenvironmental architecture characteristic of human MYCN-amplified tumors. Because
the effect of MYCN on neuroblasts is highly context specific,
interactions between tumor and host-derived stromal components
(e.g., infiltrating Schwann cells and host-secreted metalloproteinases) have a major effect on tumor biology and responses to
therapy (17). These critical interactions between the tumor and its
microenvironment reinforce the importance of species-matched
interactions between host and stromal elements.
To develop these mice as a platform for targeted therapy and to
exploit species-matched interactions between tumor and microenvironment in this native model, we characterized malignant
progression and neovascularization in murine tumors hemizygous
for the MYCN transgene. Animals with tumors were divided into

three groups: early (group I), intermediate (group II), and advanced
(group III). Within this framework, we assessed indices of
proliferation, apoptosis, and vascularity and correlated these with
the expression of markers known in human tumors to be
associated with malignant progression in tumor cells and with
angiogenesis in the microenvironment. We next evaluated
sensitivity to antiangiogenic therapy. Remarkably, and in contrast
with published data using human tumors xenografted into

immunocompromised mice (18–21), the antiangiogenic fumagillin
analogue TNP-470 led to near-complete regression of advanced
tumors. The HPMA copolymer–conjugated form of TNP-470
(caplostatin) was equally effective and is an attractive agent for
clinical use due to its favorable pharmacokinetics, nontoxic profile,
and water solubility. These studies establish the importance of
interactions between tumor and microenvironment in a speciesmatched immunocompetent mouse model for this common

should be further tested clinically in the treatment of childhood
neuroblastoma.

Materials and Methods
Tissue preparation. Mice were anesthetized and either lectin perfused
or sacrificed without perfusion. Tumor tissues were embedded and flash
frozen immediately after excision. Lectin-perfused animals received a
retroorbital injection of 1 AL/g of rhodamine-conjugated RCAI lectin
(Vector Laboratories). Animals were then perfused with 4% paraformaldehyde (Fisher) at 15 mL/min, followed by further perfusion with PBS at the
same rate. Both flash frozen and lectin-perfused tissues were sectioned at
10-Am thickness, mounted and stored at 80jC. All experiments were
approved by the University of California-San Francisco Institutional Animal
Care and Use Committee.
Immunocytochemical staining. Frozen sections were fixed in 4%
paraformaldehyde. Tissues were blocked for 1 h in 0.5% Tween (Fisher), 2%
bovine serum albumin (Sigma Chemical Co.), and 5% normal horse or goat
serum (Jackson ImmunoResearch, Inc.) and then incubated with primary
antisera and dilutions: monoclonal rat anti-mouse CD31 antibody
(BD PharMingen, Inc.), 1:500; polyclonal rabbit antisera to all isoforms of
VEGF (Neomarker, Inc.), 1:300; polyclonal rabbit antisera to VEGF-R2 (22),
10 Ag/mL; polyclonal rabbit anti-human MMP-2 (Chemicon, Inc.), 1:50;
monoclonal mouse anti–a-SMA clone 1A4 (Sigma), 1:1,000; polyclonal rabbit
antisera to Ki67 (Novocastra, Inc.), 1:500. Secondary antibodies included
Cy-2–conjugated donkey anti-rat, Cy-3–conjugated donkey anti-rabbit, or
Cy-3 donkey anti-mouse (all from Jackson ImmunoResearch; 1:200).
Quantification of proliferation and apoptosis. Immunofluorescent
images were examined using MetaMorph 6.1 (Molecular Devices Corp.). In
representative slides from tumors of each group, immunofluorescence for
TUNEL, bis-benzimide, or Ki67 was separately quantified in five fields.

www.aacrjournals.org

Results were averaged for tumors of each group. The Student’s t test was
used to evaluate statistical significance. Apoptotic cells were identified
using the DEADEND Fluorometric TUNEL System (Promega, Inc.). Tissues
were sectioned at 4 Am and stained with Gill’s hematoxylin III (American
Master Tech Scientific, Inc.) and 1% alcoholic eosin (Sigma). H&E-stained
tissues were viewed with an Axioskop 2 FS+, and images were captured with
an AxioCam HR (Carl Zeiss MicroImaging, Inc.). Immunofluorescence was
viewed and photographed with a Confocal Laser Scanning Microscope 510
NLO (Zeiss).
Reverse transcription-PCR. Tumor tissues were flash frozen and stored
at 80jC. Total RNA was extracted using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen, Inc.),
and 6 Ag of total RNA were reverse transcribed using Superscript II RNaseH
H (Invitrogen). Expression of MMP-9 and L-19 (loading control) was
assessed after 30 cycles using the primers indicated (Supplementary
Fig. S1).
Treatment of mice with TNP-470 and caplostatin. Animals hemizygous for the MYCN transgene with palpable, intermediate group tumors
(f60 days of life) were treated three times per week with i.p. injections of
TNP-470 (100 mg/kg in 100 AL DMSO) or DMSO alone for 2 weeks (eight
animals per group). At sacrifice, tumors were excised, measured, weighed,
snapped-frozen for immunoblotting, fixed in 10% buffered formalin for
paraffin embedding or fresh-frozen for immunohistochemistry of frozen
sections. Mice were weighed daily to monitor for drug toxicity. Weight loss
was limited to 15% by institutional protocol. Treatment was terminated at
2 weeks when three animals in the treated group had weight loss above the
cutoff (Supplementary Fig. S2). Caplostatin experiments were done similarly
at an i.p. TNP-470 equivalent dose of 50 mg/kg dissolved in saline. This dose
(50% of the dose used for unconjugated TNP-470 experiments) is similar to
dosing of caplostatin used in other animal models.
Evaluation of neurotoxicity. Neurotoxicity was monitored using a
rotarod assay, which uses a rotating treadmill (Medical Associates, Inc.), to
assess coordination and balance. Before and after 1 and 2 weeks of therapy
with caplostatin, mice were first placed on the rotarod for 30 s to permit

acclimation. Mice were then replaced on the rotarod at a standard
acceleration rate of 3 rotations/min/s. Time on the treadmill (hang time)
was recorded for each animal.
Statistical methods. In vitro data are expressed as means F SDs, and
in vivo data as means F SE. Statistical significance testing used the
Student’s t test. For detected differences, the Wilcoxon rank-sum test was
used to assess pairwise differences between treatment groups, with P < 0.05
considered to be statistically significant.

Results
Malignant progression in mice transgenic for TH-MYCN. We
dissected a cohort of 60 animals hemizygous for the MYCN

transgene in strain 129X1/SvJ at ages ranging from 44 to 80 days
(Fig. 1A). Four or more animals were analyzed by full necropsy at
each time point. In this strain, tumor onset was reproducible and
confined to a narrow age window (Fig. 1A). Penetrance for tumors
was 65% by 95 days (Fig. 1B). Tumors arising in the mice were
classified according to size and degree of regional spread analogous
in these two characteristics to the staging of primary human
neuroblastoma (23).
Localized tumors (group I) arose between 45 and 55 days of life
(Fig. 1C and D), were small and spherical (approximately the size of
a kidney), showed no regional organ invasion, and were not easily
palpated (analogous to stage I tumors in humans). Intermediate

(n = 8 mice per group).

tumors (group II) arose between 55 and 65 days of life and were 1.5
to 2 kidney diameters, adherent to major blood vessels and organs,
and easily palpable (analogous to stage II tumors in humans;
Fig. 1E and F). Organ margins were negative for tumor by histologic analysis (data not shown). Advanced tumors (group III) arose
after 65 days, were grossly visible in the absence of palpation, and,
on necropsy, crossed the midline, reminiscent of stage III tumors
in humans in size and degree of regional involvement (Fig. 1G
and H). Tumor histology was similar in all groups (Fig. 1D, F,
and H), revealing a predominance of small, round, blue tumor cells
(neuroblasts) in a stroma-poor background, with an abundance of
tumor-associated blood vessels of varying caliber. Tumor-associated
vessels in group III lesions, in general, were more dilated, with a
larger cross-sectional vessel diameter. There was no difference in
vascular leakage between group I and group III lesions visible on
unperfused H&E-stained tumor sections, except in areas of
localized tumor necrosis, which were more readily apparent in
group III lesions (Fig. 1H, inset) and were rare in other groups.
Local spread to lymph nodes was observed in all groups (Fig. 1I).
Whereas gross metastases were rare, microscopic metastases to the
liver and kidney were seen in four of four animals with group III
tumors (Fig. 1J).

Proliferation, detected by nuclear localization of Ki67 antigen,
was high in all groups (Fig. 2A–C). TUNEL staining of apoptotic
nuclei (Fig. 2D–F) increased significantly in group III compared
with group I (P < 0.001), consistent with the structural findings of
areas of increased cell death and focal apoptosis on H&E staining
(Fig. 1D, F, and H). There was no statistical difference in TUNEL
positivity between group I and II. The increased apoptosis in
advanced tumors likely reflects an inability of these lesions to
maintain adequate tissue perfusion and oxygen tension, a characteristic common to large solid tumors (24). Levels of MYCN mRNA
were assessed by reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) and did not
differ among groups (data not shown).
Murine neuroblastoma is highly vascularized. To evaluate
vascularity, mice with palpable tumors were analyzed by perfusion
fixation with rhodamine-conjugated lectin, followed by immunofluorescent analysis using antisera to platelet-endothelial cell
adhesion molecule (CD31). Tumors displayed a rich vasculature
(Fig. 2G–J). Rare small vessels stained for CD31 in the absence of
rhodamine immunofluorescence (Fig. 2H–J, arrows) indicating
nonfunctioning vessels. Although vasculature was plentiful in all
tumors (Fig. 3A–C), vessels seemed dilated and more irregular
within advanced lesions (Fig. 3A–C). Periendothelial cells were

visualized using antisera to smooth muscle actin (a-SMA) and colocalized to the CD31-stained vasculature in all groups (Fig. 3D–F).
There were no quantifiable differences in vascular pericyte coverage between group I and group III tumors. Tumor cells in all groups
showed strong cytoplasmic immunoreactivity for VEGF ligand
(Fig. 3G–I). To assess VEGF-R2 expression in endothelial cells,
tumor tissues were stained with antisera against CD31 and VEGFR2. Colocalization of CD31 and VEGF-R2 immunoreactivity was
illustrated in all groups (Fig. 3J–L). Antisera to MMP-2 showed
cytoplasmic staining that associated closely with CD31 positive
endothelial cells lining the blood vessels (Fig. 3M–O). The
immunoreactivity of MMP-9 could not be adequately assessed
using commercial antisera. By RT-PCR, expression of MMP-9
mRNA increased in group III tumors, compared with tumors in
groups I and II (Supplementary Fig. S1).
Efficacy of angiogenesis inhibitors in murine neuroblastoma. The robust vascularity common to both murine and high-risk
MYCN-amplified human neuroblastoma led us to test whether
angiogenesis inhibitors could show efficacy. We treated established
murine tumors using TNP-470, a methionine aminopeptidase-2
inhibitor with defined activity against xenografted human neuroblastoma (19–21, 25–28). Groups of eight animals with intermediate
tumors were treated with TNP-470 (100 mg/kg i.p. thrice weekly) or
placebo for 2 weeks, when euthanasia was required due to significant
weight loss in treated animals (Supplementary Fig. S2).
Tumors showed a striking response to therapy compared with
placebo-treated controls (Fig. 4A and compare B and C). Marked
changes were observed in the histologic appearance and immunohistochemical features of tumors treated with TNP-470
(Fig. 4D–K). The characteristic lobular appearance of tumor
neuroblasts with surrounding intact blood vessels was replaced
by grossly visible hemorrhagic areas with increased apoptosis and
necrosis (Fig. 4, compare D and H). On immunohistochemical
analysis of paraffin-embedded sections, treated tumors showed
reduced staining for the proliferative marker Ki67, except in wellperfused areas surrounding large blood vessels (compare Fig. 4E
and I), supporting a role for vascular integrity in maintaining
proliferation of these tumors. The degree of apoptosis, assessed by
staining of cleaved caspase-3, was greatly increased by TNP-470
treatment (compare Fig. 4F and J), again with sparing of neuroblasts in perivascular locations (arrows). Disruption of the perilobular distribution of small blood vessels was readily apparent
(compared by CD31 staining in Fig. 4G and K), consistent with
angiogenic blockade effecting small vessels to a greater degree than
large vessels. Taken together, these findings imply that TNP-470
targets vascular integrity in established neuroblastoma tumors
with a secondary effect on parenchymal neuroblasts, resulting in
eradication of tumor parenchyma through apoptosis and necrosis.
Significant weight loss requiring euthanasia (>15%) was observed
in treated animals (average weight, 21 F 2 g in treated animals
versus 28 F 3 g average in controls, P < 0.01). Because neurotoxicity
and associated weight loss preclude the use of TNP-470 clinically,
we next tested HPMA copolymerized TNP-470 (caplostatin), a
water-soluble form of TNP-470 that does not cross the blood-brain
barrier, and that is better tolerated in preclinical models (29, 30).
Caplostatin was also highly effective as a single agent against
established tumors (Fig. 5A and compare B and C). No statistically
significant weight loss was observed in caplostatin-treated animals
(Supplementary Fig. S2). Furthermore, caplostatin-treated animals
displayed similar retention time on the rotarod assay compared
with control mice (Supplementary Fig. S3), indicative of normal

associated with free TNP-470 (29, 30).

aggressive tumors of the brain or colon may arise through the
sequential acquisition of malignant characteristics (32, 33), low-risk
neuroblastoma tumors diploid for MYCN generally do not progress
to high-risk disease MYCN-amplified disease (1). In fact, the clinical
presentation of neuroblastoma is consistent with a nonlinear
model, through which neuroblast progenitors follow one of several
distinct pathways to transformation, leading to tumors of low,
intermediate, and high-risk, respectively. Amplification of MYCN is
associated with advanced disease and is the best-characterized
genetic marker of high-risk neuroblastoma (1). The association of
MYCN amplification with aggressive disease suggests that transformed neuroblasts fail to respond to differentiating signals, a
process normally associated with down-regulation of Mycn (34).
Within the confines of a murine tumor that models MYCNamplified neuroblastoma in children, we developed a classification
that incorporates tumor size and local invasiveness. Tumor cell
proliferation did not change between groups and was therefore not
incorporated. Both apoptosis and metastases increased as a
function of tumor size, as observed in high-risk tumors in children
(35). The increased levels of apoptosis in large murine tumors are
also observed in other advanced human neoplasms (36–38).
Collectively, these observations suggest that murine neuroblastoma
driven by a TH-MYCN transgene closely models a subset of
childhood neuroblastoma amplified for MYCN, leading to similarly
aggressive and poorly differentiated malignancies.
Whereas xenograft models for neuroblastoma have been
valuable for testing cytotoxic chemotherapy, the species-mismatched microenvironment has potential limitations for evaluation of targeted antiangiogenic agents. Transgenic mouse models
have proved useful for stepwise mechanistic analyses of interactions between tumor and vascular compartments, for studying
the effects of inhibiting angiogenesis, and for assessing the effect of
such interventions on tumor cells (4, 39, 40). In contrast to flank
xenograft models, tumors in mice transgenic for TH-MYCN arise in
a species-matched immunocompetent host, in comparable locations to those in children with neuroblastoma (suprarenal,
abdominal or thoracic paraspinal ganglia), show genetic heterogeneity typical of human disease (13–16, 41), and coopt a speciesmatched vasculature. These variables, as well as the clinical
importance of this tumor in children (the most common

rationale to develop TH-MYCN transgenic mice as a platform for
developmental therapeutics in neuroblastoma.
Given the prominence of interactions between MYCN-driven
neuroblasts and the neighboring microenvironment, targeted
agents that disrupt these interactions hold great potential for
therapy. Childhood MYCN-amplified neuroblastoma is typically a
vascular tumor, with much of this neovascularization mediated by
interactions between MYCN-amplified neuroblasts and the local
microenvironment. Perfusion-fixation of murine tumors with
rhodamine and CD31 also documents a comparably complex
vasculature mirroring that observed in human disease. Expression
of VEGF has been reported in primary neuroblasts from human
neuroblastoma, whereas expressions of VEGF-R1, VEGF-R2, MMP2,
MMP9, and a-SMA are expressed in endothelial and periendothelial cells within the tumor microenvironment (5, 6, 11, 42–46). All of
these proteins were also expressed in appropriate tumor and
stromal elements from mice transgenic for TH-MYCN.

copolymer caplostatin is marked and is more profound than
previous reports of the activity of this and other antiangiogenic
agents using human xenograft models for neuroblastoma (19–21,
25–28, 47–49). That an antiangiogenic agent affects the progression of established aggressive neuroblastomas bodes well for
comparable agents as components of therapy for disease in
humans. TNP-470 itself has shown some toxicity in preclinical
and clinical trials. Caplostatin abrogates this toxicity (29, 30) and
therefore should be an attractive agent for a phase I clinical study
in neuroblastoma.
