ABSTRACT
The establishment of docetaxel-based chemotherapeutic treatments has improved
the survival of castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) patients. However, most
patients develop resistance supporting the development of therapy. The current
study was undertaken to establish the therapeutic benefit to target hedgehog
signaling cascade using GDC-0449 to improve the efficacy of chemotherapeutic drug,
docetaxel. Here, we show that the combination of GDC-0449 plus docetaxel inhibited
the proliferation of WPE1-NB26 cells and PC3 cells via a blockade of G1 and G2M
phases. The combined treatment significantly inhibited PC cell migration in vitro.
Moreover, the apoptotic effect induced by GDC-0449 plus docetaxel on PC3 cells
was mediated, at least partly, via the mitochondrial membrane depolarization, H2O2
production and caspase cascade activation. Interestingly, GDC-0449 was effective at
inhibiting the prostasphere formation, inducing the prostasphere disintegration and
apoptotic death of side population (SP) from PC3 cells and reversing the resistance of
SP cells to docetaxel. In addition, GDC-0449 plus docetaxel also have shown a greater
anti-tumoral growth inhibitory effect on PC3 cell xenografts. These findings support
the use of the hedgehog inhibitor GDC-0449, which is currently in clinical trials,
for improving the anticarcinogenic efficacy of docetaxel-based chemotherapeutic
treatments against locally advanced, AI and metastatic PC.

docetaxel is associated with a poor prognosis and limited
treatment options [6, 8]. Therefore, new treatment options
are being actively pursued with additional agents or in
combination with the existing chemotherapeutic agents to
extend the survival of metastatic CRPC patients.
Numerous investigations have revealed that the
sustained activation of distinct growth factor pathways,
including sonic hedgehog cascade, may contribute to
the proliferation, survival and therapeutic resistance
of PC cells [9–11]. More specifically, the enhanced
expression of hedgehog signaling elements, including
sonic hedgehog ligand (SHH) and glioma-associated
oncogene homolog-1 (GLI-1) that acts as a zing finger

INTRODUCTION
Prostate cancer (PC) is the most commonly
diagnosed cancer and the second leading cause of cancerrelated deaths among United States men [1]. Organconfined and locally advanced PC are managed well by
radical prostatectomy, radiation and androgen deprivation
therapy (ADT) [2–4]. However, over a median period of
18–24 months, most tumors eventually relapse and develop
into castration-resistant PC (CRPC) [5, 6]. The current
first-line docetaxel-based chemotherapeutic treatment
regimens for metastatic CRPC are only palliative with
limited survival rate [7]. Moreover, acquired resistance to

transcription factor, has been observed in PC epithelial
cells and/or stromal compartment of tumors during
disease progression to aggressive, metastatic and AI PC
[12–18]. It has also been shown that the inhibition of the
hedgehog cascade, by using either an anti-SHH antibody
or a specific inhibitor of smoothened (SMO) activity, such
as cyclopamine, suppressed the growth and induced the
apoptosis of PC cells in vitro and in vivo, whereas normal
prostate epithelial cells were insensitive to the cytotoxic
effects of these agents [14, 15, 19, 20]. Moreover, our
previous results have indicated that the blockade of the
hedgehog and EGFR pathways using cyclopamine and
gefitinib induced the anti-proliferative and apoptotic
effects and improved the cytotoxic effect of docetaxel on
androgen-dependent (AD), androgen-independent (AI)
and metastatic PC cell lines [15, 19]. Additionally, recent
preclinical studies and clinical trials have also revealed
that the targeting of the hedgehog signaling pathway with
GDC-0449 (vismodegib) induced the anticarcinogenic
effects against aggressive cancers, including patients with
medulloblastoma, breast, lung and basal cell carcinomas
without major systemic toxicity [21–26].
Accumulating lines of evidence have also indicated
that cancer stem/progenitor cells, also designated as canceror tumor-initiating cells (TICs), can contribute to the initiation
and progression of solid tumors [27–30]. Particularly, it has
been shown that PC stem/progenitor cells endowed with stem
cell-like properties play a crucial role both in the initiation
and progression of PC [31–34]. The PC stem/progenitor
cells that are resistant to conventional radiation, ADT and
docetaxel-based chemotherapy may be responsible for the
tumor re-growth and disease relapse [35–37]. The SHH
signaling pathway plays key roles in the regulation of the
embryonic development and normal physiological process,
such as the proliferation, differentiation and survival [38].
Consequently, the deregulation of SHH signaling cascade
often results in the cancer development [39, 40]. In this
regard, it has been shown that the SHH signaling pathway is
aberrantly activated in PC [12] and plays a significant role in
the regulation of self-renewal, differentiation and survival of
PC cells. Altogether, these studies suggest that the blocking
of the SHH-GLI signaling pathway will provide an attractive
therapeutic strategy to treat advanced and metastatic PC
caused by the prostate stem/progenitor cells and prevent
disease relapse.
In the present study, in vitro and in vivo studies
have been undertaken to test the hypothesis that the
inhibition of the SHH signaling pathway would enhance
the anticarcinogenic activity of docetaxel on CRPC. The
results have indicated that GDC-0449, which specifically
targets the SHH pathway, inhibited both in vitro and in vivo
proliferation of PC cells. In addition, GDC-0449 was also
effective at enhancing the apoptotic effect of docetaxel in
PC cells. Importantly, GDC-0449 also inhibited the selfrenewal of side population (SP) PC-3 cells expressing
higher levels of stem-cell markers, and which have been

implicated in promoting epithelial-mesenchymal transition
(EMT) process and drug resistance. Taken together, the
results have shown the potential benefit to use GDC0449 for inducing anti-proliferative, anti-invasive and
apoptotic effects and improving the cytotoxicity induced
by current chemotherapeutic drug, docetaxel on AI PC
cells, including SP cells with stem cell-like properties.

RESULTS
Expression levels of SHH and GLI-1 in normal
prostate and adenocarcinoma of human prostate
tissue specimens
Identical tissue arrays containing 76 human
PC specimens with 8 normal tissue specimens were
stained for both SHH and GLI1 protein expression by
immunohistochemical technique. The SHH-positive
detection rate was 46% for 76 cases of the prostate
carcinoma specimens (Gleason scores:6–10; stages T2-T4),
and the mean of composite score values for SHH expression
was statistically higher (*p < 0.0002) for PC tissues (1.0 ±
0.2) when compared to normal prostate tissue specimens (0.1
± 0.1) (Figure 1A). Similarly, an enhanced expression of the
transcription factor of the hedgehog cascade, GLI-1 was also
observed in 47% of 76 cases of prostatic adenocarcinomas.
The mean of composite score values obtained for GLI1 expression in malignant epithelial cells in prostatic
adenocarcinoma specimens (1.9 ± 0.3) was significantly
higher as compared to the value for normal tissues (0.4 ±
0.3; *p < 0.0005) (Figure 1A). More particularly, the results
of immunohistochemical analyses have indicated that an
enhanced expression of SHH ligand primarily occurred in
the cytoplasm (indicated by the arrow) of the malignant
epithelial cells (Figures 1B and 1C) as compared to normal
prostate tissues (Figure 1D). Moreover, the expression level
of GLI-1 was also higher in prostatic adenocarcinomas and
mainly detected in the nuclei and cytoplasm of PC cells
(indicated by arrows) (Figure 1B; Figure S1). In addition,
both SHH and GLI-1 were also detected in the stromal
cells adjacent to malignant prostate epithelium (indicated
by arrow heads; Figure 1C). These data suggest that the
increase of SHH and GL1–1 expression levels in malignant
epithelial cells and the stromal compartment of PC may
promote the development of aggressive phenotypes during
PC progression to advanced disease state.

GDC-0449 synergizes with docetaxel in
inhibiting the proliferation of human PC cells
ED50 of GDC-0449 and docetaxel were determined
by MTT assay, and PC cells were treated with the
sequential doses of GDC-0449 and docetaxel, alone or
in combination, to determine whether GDC-0449 could
enhance the antiproliferative effects of docetaxel. The
results from cell proliferation assay have indicated that an

increased concentration of 1–10 μM GDC-0449 or 1–10
nM docetaxel inhibited the proliferation of WPE1-NB26,
LNCaP C-81 and PC3 cells (Figure 2) in a dose-dependant
manner. The combination of GDC-0449 and docetaxel at
ED50 was more effective in inhibiting the WPE1-NB26,
PC3 and LNCaP C-81 cell proliferation than the drugs
alone (Figure 2). Interestingly, the anti-proliferative
effect of GDC-0449 at 5 μM on LNCaP C-81 cells was
less effective when compared to the inhibitory effect
induced by this drug on highly invasive WPE1-NB26
and metastatic PC3 cells (Figure 2C vs 2A and 2B). This
divergence between the anti-proliferative effects of GDC0449 might be due to the differences between the basal
SHH expression levels detected in these PC cells (Figure
S2). Moreover, the data from fluorescence-activated
cell sorting (FACS) analyses have also revealed that the
treatment of PC3 cells with increasing concentration of
1–10 μM GDC-0449 was accompanied by a blockade of
PC3 cells in the G1 phase while 5 nM docetaxel induced
a blockade of PC3 cells in G2M phase of cell cycle
(Table 1). In addition, a combination of 5 μM GDC-0449
and 5 nM docetaxel induced a greater reduction of PC3
cell population in synthesis (S) phase through an arrest in
G1 and G2M phases of the cell cycle relative to individual
drugs (Table 1).

of LNCaP C-81 cells with GDC-0449 and docetaxel was
accompanied by a decrease of the expression level of ATPbinding cassette sub-family G member 2 (ABCG2) protein
(Figure 4F).

GDC-0449 inhibits the self-renewal capability of
SP PC cells expressing higher levels of stem cell
markers and multidrug resistant protein
FACS analyses have shown the presence of a small
subset of SP cells representing about 0.6% of the total
number of PC3 cells (Figure 5A). SP PC3 cells expressed
higher levels of stem cell-like markers (CD133, CD44),
multidrug transporter (ABCG2), hedgehog cascade (SHH
and GLI-1) and mesenchymal markers (N-cadherin
and vimentin), relative to the non-SP PC3 cell fraction
(Figures 5B–5D). SP PC3 cells also displayed a greater
prostasphere-forming ability than non-SP PC3 cells
under serum free-medium containing rhSHH in ultralow attachment plate (Figure 5E). Moreover, we have
observed that 5 μM GDC-0449 or 5 nM docetaxel, alone
or in combination, significantly inhibited the number and
size of prostaspheres formed by rhSHH-stimulated SP
PC3 cells while docetaxel alone had no significant effect
(Figures 5E and 5F). Of therapeutic interest, a treatment
of prostaspheres derived from SP PC3 cells with 10 μM
GDC-0449, alone or in combination with 5 nM docetaxel,
for 4 days was also accompanied by their disintegration
(Figure 5G). Furthermore, a treatment of SP PC3 cells
with 10 μM GDC-0449, alone or in combination with 5
nM docetaxel for 4 days, was also effective at inducing the
apoptotic effect on these immature PC cells (Figure 5H).

GDC-0449 enhances the apoptotic effects
induced by docetaxel on PC cells
The FACS analyses of the apoptotic PC cell
population in the sub-G1 phase have indicated that 10 μM
GDC-0449 or 5 nM docetaxel was effective in inducing
the apoptotic effects on WPE1-NB26 and PC3 cells
(Figures 3A–3D). Furthermore, a combination of 10 μM
GDC-0449 and 5 nM docetaxel had a higher apoptotic effect
on WPE1-NB26 and PC3 cells than the drugs alone; which
was also significantly inhibited in the presence of broad
caspase inhibitor, z-VAD-fmk at 50 μM (Figures 3A–3D).
We further examined the effect of GDC-0449 and docetaxel
on free radical generation and mitochondrial membrane
potential (Figure 4) in PC3 cells. The results from FACS
analyses have shown that the treatment of PC3 cells with 10
μM GDC-0449 plus 5 nM docetaxel was also accompanied
by a greater depolarization of mitochondrial membrane
(Figures 4A and 4B) and increase of intracellular H2O2
production (Figure 4C).
Western blot analysis further indicated that GDC0449 and docetaxel significantly increased the expression
levels of cytochrome c, cleaved caspase 9 and cleaved
PARP in PC3 cells (Figure 4D). Similarly, GDC-0449
treatment significantly increased expression levels of
cleaved caspase 9 and Bax protein in LNCaP C-81 cells
(Figure 4E). We have also observed a decrease of the
expression level of Bcl-2 and total PARP 1 (full length
118 kDa) proteins after the drug treatment of LNCaP C-81
cells. The results have also demonstrated that the treatment

The combination of GDC-0449 and docetaxel
displays greater anti-tumor effects than
individual drugs on PC-3 xenografts
An in vivo xenograft study was undertaken to
determine the therapeutic effect of GDC-0449 and
docetaxel, alone or in combination. The results have
indicated that 50 mg/kg GDC-0449 or 5 mg/kg docetaxel
was effective at inhibiting the tumor growth of PC3
xenografts as compared to untreated PC3 xenografts
in athymic nude mice (Figure 6A). Furthermore, a
combination of 50 mg/kg GDC-0449 and 5 mg/docetaxel
had a greater tumor inhibitory effect on PC3 xenograft
without significant toxicity as compared to individual
drugs (Figure 6A).

decrease of GLI-1-positive red staining relative to untreated

than the drugs alone in inducing the caspase-9 activation

D1 and Bcl2 [42, 43]. Further, it has been shown that
SHH-mediated signaling pathway directly exports the
GLI-1 transcription factor enabling its cytoplasmic to
nuclear shuttling [42, 44]. In agreement with the previous
observations [14, 17, 45, 46], higher cytoplasmic SHH
and the nuclear GLI-1 expression levels in prostatic
adenocarcinomas tissues suggest that the sustained
activation of sonic hedgehog cascade may contribute
to the PC development and progression to locally
invasive, aggressive and AI PC. Importantly, the
immunohistochemical analyses have indicated that the
increased expression levels of SHH and GLI-1 frequently
occur in prostatic adenocarcinoma tissue specimens
relative to non-malignant prostate tissues (Figure 1).
Moreover, SHH and GLI-1 expression were also upregulated in tumor-associated stromal cells in PC tissue
specimens (Figure 1). In addition, the expression level
of SHH was also higher in PC cells when compared to
immortalized normal prostate epithelial cells (Figure S2).
These data are in agreement with earlier studies that have
revealed an increase of expression levels of hedgehog
signaling components (SHH, patched (PTCH) receptor,
smoothened (SMO) co-receptor, GLI-1 and/or GLI-2
transcription factors) were detected in some cases of
high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PINs), PC
tissues and bone metastases relative to normal prostate and
adjacent non-malignant human prostate tissues [12, 13, 15–
19]. More specifically, the data from immunohistochemical
analyses of SHH, PTCH and GLI-1 in 155 cases of PC
have indicated that the enhanced expression of these
proteins was significantly associated with poor prognostic
parameters, including a larger tumor size, high serum
prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels, high Gleason
score, perineural invasion and anatomic stage/prognostic
groups (ASPG) [18]. Moreover, it has been reported
that the enhanced expression and aberrant activation of
hedgehog signaling elements in PC epithelial cells and
tumor-associated stromal cells may be induced through
ligand-dependent autocrine and paracrine mechanisms
[12, 14, 17, 38]. A shifting toward the autocrine stimulation
of hedgehog cascade in PC epithelial cells has been

DISCUSSION
The microtubule-targeting agent, docetaxel is the
first-line chemotherapeutic drug used for the treatment of
metastatic CRPC [7]. However, the patients often develop
therapeutic resistance to docetaxel-based treatment and
have fewer treatment options. A growing body of evidence
suggests that an aberrant activation of SHH signaling
cascade is involved in the progression and development of
metastatic and AI PC [12, 41]. In parallel, it has been shown
that the malignant transformation of prostate-resident
adult stem/progenitor cells into PC stem/progenitor cells
leads to the development of aggressive, AI and recurrent
cancers [12, 33]. Furthermore, these PC stem/progenitor
cells are relatively resistant to both ADT and docetaxelbased chemotherapies, suggesting that their expansion
may drive disease relapse of PC patients observed in the
clinics [12, 32, 34]. In spite of significant recent progress,
the anticarcinogenic effects induced by a combination
of docetaxel and GDC-0449 on AI and metastatic PC is
relatively unknown. Therefore, the present study has been
carried out to investigate the anti-carcinogenic effects
induced by a combined treatment of GDC-0449 and
docetaxel on AI PC cells both in vitro and in vivo.
Under physiological conditions, the transmembrane
protein Ptch1 inhibits the seven-span transmembrane

the up-regulation of hedgehog signaling molecules (SHH,
PTCH1, SMO, GLI-1 and GLI-2) expression levels was
observed in PC patient tissue specimens who received
ADT, or both ADT and docetaxel [47, 48]. Altogether,
these data suggest an important role for the uncontrolled

stromal cells in their tumor microenvironment during the

of ABCG2, a multidrug transporter protein which can
act as a cellular defense mechanism by effusing the
drug out of the cells. The decreased level of ABCG2
protein in our study supports the use of GDC-0449 in
combination with docetaxel for therapeutic enhancement.
The GDC-0449 was also effective at increasing the antiproliferative, anti-invasive and apoptotic effects induced
by current chemotherapeutic drug, docetaxel on WPE1NB26 and PC3 cells through an arrest in G1 and G2/M
phases of the cell cycle and mitochondrial-dependent
caspase activation (Figures 2 and 4). Importantly,
GDC-0449 also inhibited the self-renewal capacity of
CD133+/CD44high/ABCG2high SP cells with stem celllike properties and expressing high levels of SHH, GLI1 and EMT process-associated molecules, and induced
the cytotoxic effects and reversed the resistance of SP
cells to docetaxel (Figure 5). Furthermore, GDC-0449
significantly inhibited PC3 xenograft and synergized with
docetaxel in inhibiting PC3 xenograft growth (Figure 6).
Hence, these data indicate that a combination of GDC0449 plus docetaxel is more efficient than individual
drugs to eliminate the total mass of PC cells, including
PC stem/progenitor cells, which provide critical role in
treatment resistance and tumor relapse of PC patients.
In support with these observations, several preclinical
studies have also shown that the blockade of hedgehog
signaling pathway using an inhibitor of SMO activity,
such as cyclopamine or NVP-LDE-225 (Erismodegib),
reduced the proliferation, invasiveness and/or metastatic
potential of PC cells, and reversed chemoresistance and
prevented tumor relapse after treatment cessation in
vivo [14, 49–51]. For instance, it has been observed that
the inhibition of hedgehog pathway by NVP-LDE-225
suppressed the EMT process and sphere-forming ability
of CD133+/CD44+ PC stem/progenitor cells and induced
the apoptosis in these immature PC cells [50]. NVPLDE-225 was also effective at inhibiting the tumor
growth of PC cells in humanized non-obese and diabetic/
severe combined immune deficient and IL2 receptor
gamma (NOD/SCID IL2Rγ) null mice [50]. Furthermore,
it has been observed that cyclopamine was also effective
at chemosensitizing paclitaxel-resistant DU145-TXR
and PC3-TXR cells to paclitaxel treatment at least in part
via the P-glycoprotein down-regulation and reducing
the SP cell fraction in these cells [52]. Similarly,
docetaxel-resistant PC cell subpopulation exhibiting
an up-regulation of hedgehog and Notch cascades has
been detected in CRPC tissue specimens from patients
who received docetaxel treatment [32]. It has also been
noted that the down-regulation of hedgehog and Notch
cascades by small hairpin RNA (shRNA) or a treatment
with cyclopamine and γ-secretase inhibitor dibenzazepine
(dbz) of docetaxel-resistant DU145-DR and 22Rv1-DR
cells endowed with a tumor-initiating capacity induced
their apoptosis, and chemosensitized these PC cells to
docetaxel in vitro and in vivo [32].

Recently clinical trials have been undertaken to
establish the benefit of using hedgehog inhibitors, such as
GDC-0449, in patients with aggressive, locally advanced
and metastatic cancers, including PC harboring aberrant
activation of hedgehog cascades. The data from phases
I and II clinical trials have revealed that GDC-0449 was
well tolerated and a complete or partial tumor response
occurred in some patients with locally advanced and
aggressive basal cell carcinomas and medulloblastoma
after a treatment with GDC-0449 as monotherapy [26,
36, 53, 54]. In spite of these promising results, it had been
reported that the long-term treatment with GDC-0449 alone
was associated with the persistence of chronic secondary
effects (fatigue, muscle spasms, weight loss, dysgeusia,
alopecia, hyponatremia and nausea) and acquisition of
drug resistance by cancer cells in some cancer patients.
Therefore, these observations underline the importance to
develop novel combination therapies by using low doses
of the drug targeting hedgehog cascade, such as GDC0449, with other cytotoxic agents to reduce side effects and
prevent the development of drug resistance.
Overall, our results have indicated that orally
active sonic hedgehog inhibitor GDC-0449 is effective in
inducing the anti-proliferative, anti-tumoral and apoptotic
effects and improving the anti-carcinogenic effects of
docetaxel on PC in vitro and in vivo models. Hence, our
data will support future clinical trials aiming to determine
the anti-carcinogenic properties of GDC-0449, alone or
in combination with anti-hormonal treatment, radiation,
chemotherapy or other molecular targeted agents, for treating
patients with aggressive, metastatic, AI and relapsed PC.

stages T2-T4) and normal prostate tissues obtained from
autopsy from 8 patients of different ages (19–43 years).
The immunohistochemical staining of tissue microarrays
was carried out using the immPRESS™ reagent kit as
per manufacturer recommendation (Vector Laboratories,
Burlingame, CA, USA) [19, 20, 59]. Briefly, the tissue
microarray slides were deparaffinized, and antigen
retrieval performed with a solution of 0.01 M citrate buffer
pH 6.0. After nonspecific blocking with normal horse
serum, the tissue specimens were incubated with primary
anti-SHH or anti-GLI-1 antibody in a humidified chamber
overnight at 4°C. Subsequently, tissue arrays were washed
with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and incubated with
universal secondary anti-mouse/rabbit antibody for 30
min. After quenching endogenous peroxidase activity
using 0.3% hydrogen peroxide in methanol:PBS (1:1) for
10 min, the tissue sections were stained with a solution
of 3,3’-diaminobenzidine “DAB” substrate as indicated in
the manufacturer’s instructions.
For each tissue specimens, the intensity of
immunoreactivity for SHH or GLI-1 protein was semiquantitatively graded by a urologic pathologist (Dr.
Johansson) on a 0 to +3 scale (0 = no staining, 1 + =
week staining, 2 + = moderate staining and 3 + = strong
staining). The percentage of PC cells that exhibited a
positive staining for SHH or GLI-1 within a given tissue
core was also scored on a 1 to 4 scale (1 = 0–25%, 2 =
26–50%, 3 = 51–75% and 4 = 76–100% positive cells).
The score of the staining intensity and the percentage of
immunoreactive PC cells were then multiplied to obtain
a composite score ranging from 0 to 12. The means of
composite score values obtained for SHH and GLI1 staining in prostate adenocarcinoma samples were
compared to the values for normal prostate tissues.

Cell lines
Human RWPE1, WPE1-NB26, LNCaP-FGC and
PC3 cell lines were originally obtained from American
Type Culture Collection (ATCC) (Manassas, VA, USA).
RWPE1 is human prostate epithelial cells derived from
the histologically normal tissue and established with
transfecting a single copy of the human papilloma virus
18 (HPV-18) [55]. WPE1-NB26 cells were derived from
RWPE-1 cells after exposure to N-methyl-N-nitrosourea
(MNU) and established by two cycles of tumor growth in
xenograft mice [56]. The tumorigenic WPE1-NB26 cells
were cultured in keratinocyte serum-free medium (SFM)
supplemented bovine pituitary extract and epidermal
growth factor (EGF). PC-3 was established from a bone
metastatic site of grade IV prostatic adenocarcinoma
patient [57]. The highly metastatic, androgen-independent
PC3 cells were grown in phenol red-positive RPMI1640 culture medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum
(FBS), 1% glutamine and 1% penicillin–streptomycin.
LNCaP C-81 cells (passage number greater than 81) was
established in our laboratory from androgen-sensitive
LNCaP-FGC cells after prolonged culture in regular RPMI
culture medium [58]. LNCaP C-81 cells were cultured in
RPMI supplemented with 10% FBS, 1% glutamine and
1% penicillin-streptomycin. LNCaP C-81 cells exhibit the
CR phenotype including functional AR expression and AI
PSA secretion and grow rapidly in the steroid-deprived
culture conditions. WPE1-NB26, LNCaP C-81 and PC3
cells were maintained in a 37°C incubator supplied with
5% CO2 and routinely tested for morphological features
(Roche Diagnostics, Indianapolis, IN, USA).

Cell growth and apoptosis assays
For analyses of ED50 and anti-proliferative effects,
WPE1-NB26, LNCaP C-81 or PC3 cells were seeded
on 96-well plates at a density of 3 × 104 cells per well
in a culture medium containing 0.5% FBS with varying
concentrations of GDC-0449, and docetaxel, alone
or in combination, and the cell proliferation was then
assessed after 48 h by using MTT assay [19, 20, 59].
To determine the cell cycle distribution, PC3 cells were
also grown at a density of 5 × 105 cells on 25 cm2 dishes
and treated with different concentrations of GDC-0449
and docetaxel, alone or in combination, for 48 h and PC
cell populations were analyzed by FACS. For analyses
of apoptotic effects of tested drugs, WPE1-NB26 or PC3
cells were untreated (control) or treated with different
concentrations of GDC-0449 and docetaxel or 10 μM
GDC-0449 plus 5 nM docetaxel in the presence or
absence of broad caspase inhibitor z-VAD-fmk at 50 μM
for 4 days. The number of apoptotic PC cells detected
in the sub-G1 population was analyzed by FACS as
described previously [19, 20, 59].

Immunohistochemical analyses
Immunohistochemical analyses of the expression
levels of SHH and GLI-1 proteins were performed using
tissue microarrays containing formalin-fixed and paraffinembedded normal and adenocarcinomas of prostatic
tissues (Biomax Inc. Rockville, Maryland, USA). The
tissue microarrays PR954 containing duplicate cores
from 36 patients with primary prostatic adenocarcinomas
(Gleason scores: 6–10; stages T2-T4) and PR483
containing single core from 40 patients with localized
prostatic adenocarcinomas (Gleason scores: 6–10;

activation

Prostasphere-forming and disintegration assays
The parental PC3 cells (1 × 106 cells/mL)
were stained with fluorescent Hoechst dye at a final
concentration of 2 μg/mL for 2 h at 37°C and subsequently
SP and non-SP cell fractions were isolated using a FACS
(Becton Dickinson Biosciences) as previously described
[61–63]. The SP and non-SP cell fractions are maintained
in respective serum-free medium containing exogenous
EGF (10 ng/mL) plus fibroblast growth factor at 8 ng/
mL before their use for experiment. The self-renewal
capability of SP cells versus the non-SP cell fraction from
PC3 cells was estimated based on their ability to form the
non-adherent aggregates in serum-free culture conditions
under ultra-low attachment plate (Corning, Invitrogen).
For prostasphere-forming assays, 500 viable SP or nonSP PC3 cells were suspended in serum free medium with
or without exogenous rhSHH (10 ng/ml) onto a 6-well
plate. The prostasphere was also treated with 5 μM GDC0449 or 5 nM docetaxel, alone or in combination. For
each group, cells were plated in triplicate. After seven
days of incubation, the numbers of prostaspheres formed
were counted, and the representative SP PC3 cell-derived
prostaspheres were photographed (Accu-scope phasecontrast microscope) at a magnification of × 200.
For the prostasphere disintegration assays, 500
viable SP PC3 cells were grown in serum-free culture
conditions containing 10 ng/ml rhSHH under an ultralow attachment plate during seven days for the formation
of prostaspheres and then 10 μM GDC-0449 and 5 nM
docetaxel, alone or in combination, were added to culture
medium and incubated for additional four days. At day
eleven, the representative pictures of disintegrated
prostaspheres were photographed (Accu-scope phasecontrast microscope) at a magnification of × 200.

PC3 cells were treated with 10 μM GDC-0449 and 5
nM docetaxel, alone or in combination for four days. The
adherent and floating PC cells were collected, rinsed twice
with PBS and centrifuged. For determining mitochondrial
membrane potential (MMP), 1 × 106 PC3 cells were
resuspended in 1 ml PBS containing 40 nM DiOC6(3)
and incubated for 20 min at 37°C. The accumulation of
DiOC6 (3), a cationic, lipophilic and fluorescent dye within
the mitochondria of PC3 cells was measured by FACS
analyses [19, 60].
For analyses of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2)
production, PC3 cells were treated with 10 μM GDC0449 and 5 nM docetaxel alone or in combination for 4
days, and the floating and adherent cells were collected
and washed in PBS. The PC cell pellets were resuspended
in 1 ml PBS containing 5 μM DCFH-DA dye, incubated
at 37°C for 20 min and the intracellular H2O2 levels
monitored by cytofluorometric analyses of the changes
in the DCF fluorescence intensity emitted in green at
a wavelength of 525 nm. In addition, the amounts of
cytochrome c present in the cytosolic extracts and cleaved
caspase-9 fragment and cleaved PARP fragment in PC3
cell lysates prepared from PC cells untreated (control) or
treated with drugs were also estimated by western blot
analyses as described above.

Western blot analyses
PC3 and LNCaP C-81 cell lysates were prepared,
and the protein concentrations were determined using
Bio-Rad protein assay kit (Bio-Rad Inc., Hercules, CA)
[19, 20, 61]. The PC cell lysates of 20–40 μg proteins
were electrophoresed on 8 or 10% SDS-polyacrylamide
gel under reducing conditions and transferred onto
an immobilon-P PVDF membrane. The membranes
were blocked with 5% non-fat dry milk in PBS for
2 h. Subsequently, the blots were washed in PBS
containing 0.1% Tween, and incubated with respective
primary antibody overnight at 4°C. Subsequently, the
membranes were incubated with respective horseradish
peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Amersham
Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ) for 1 h. Antibodyantigen complexes were visualized using enhanced
chemiluminescence kit (Amersham Biosciences, USA).
To analyze the intensity of the bands, densitometry
was conducted on the autoradiograms using ImageJ.
exe program (http://rsb.info.nih.gov/). To calculate
the relative protein level, each densitometer value was
normalized to the corresponding b-actin protein level,
then to respective controls. The ratio of control groups
were considered as 1.0.

Confocal microscopy analyses
Parental PC3 cells or SP and non-SP cell fractions
isolated from PC3 cells by FACS as described above and
were grown in sterilized cover slips for 24 h, washed with
PBS, and fixed in ice-cold methanol at −20°C for 2 min.
After 24 hours, the PC cells were blocked by 10% normal
goat serum at 25°C for 30 min. Then, PC cells were
incubated with phycoerythrin-conjugated monoclonal antiCD133/2 antibody (293C3), rabbit polyclonal antibody
directed against ABCG2 (B-25), SHH (H-160), GLI-1
(H-300), cleaved caspase-9 fragment (Asp330), cleaved
PARP fragment (H-250) or mouse monoclonal antibody
directed against CD44 (HCAM, F-4), N-cadherin,
vimentin (V6630), cytochrome c (6H2) or β-actin (clone
AC-15) diluted in PBS for 1 h at room temperature. After
three washes with PBS, PC3 cells were then incubated
with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated
goat anti-mouse and/or Texas red-conjugated goat antirabbit secondary antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch
3899

Oncotarget

Laboratories, Inc., West Grove, PA) for 1 h and washed
again with PBS. In addition, for F-actin staining, PC3 cells
were fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde, permeabilized with
0.5% Triton X-100 and stained by using red fluorescent
rhodamine phalloidin (R415; Molecular Probes, Eugene,
OR, USA) for 20 min at room temperature. PC3 cell
nuclei were counterstained with diamidino-2-phenylindole
(DAPI), and cover slips mounted on glass slides in antifade Vestashield mounting medium (Vector Laboratories,
Burlingame, CA). Immunofluorescence staining of PC3
cells was observed under a confocal laser scanning
microscope (LSM 510, Zeiss, Gottingen, Germany) and
photographed at a magnification of × 630.
In addition, immunohistofluorescence analyses of
GLI-1 and cleaved caspase-9 fragment were also carried
out using tumor tissue specimens from untreated or treated
PC3 xenografts. The tissue slides were blocked with 10%
goat serum for 30 min followed by incubation with the
primary antibody against GLI-1 or cleaved caspase-9
fragment for 2 h. The slides were washed twice with
PBS and processed for immunofluorescent detection as
described above for the confocal microscopic analyses
of fixed PC cells. Further, the terminal deoxynucleotidyl
transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) assay
was also performed to detect the DNA fragmentation
indicative of apoptotic cell death induced by GDC0449 and docetaxel on tumor tissue specimens from
untreated or treated PC3 xenografts. The tissue sections
were incubated in the TdT reaction mixture consisting
of nucleotide-labeling mix (TUNEL Label) contains
fluorescein-dUTP and -dNTPs plus TdT enzyme (Roche
diagnostics, IN) in a humidified chamber in the dark
for 1 h at 37°C. After three washes with PBS, tissue
sections were counterstained with DAPI and visualized
by confocal fluorescence microscopy.

end of these experiments, the mice were sacrificed, and
the tumors were excised, weighed, and prepared for
immunohistofluorescence analyses of tumor tissues.

Statistical analyses
Statistical analyses were performed by using the
Student’s t-test to compare the results with P values < 0.05
indicating statistically significant between two groups.
The composite scores of immunohistochemical data
obtained for SHH and GLI-1 expression in non-malignant
and malignant prostate tissue specimens were analyzed
by using MedCalc for Windows (version 9.6.4.0.)
(Ostend, Belgium). The values of composite scores were
considered as continuous variables and compared using
Student’s two-tailed t-test assuming unequal variance for
independent samples.

In vivo experiments were performed in accordance
with a protocol approved by the UNMC Institutional
Animal Care and Use Committee. PC3 cells (3 × 106
cells) were subcutaneously implanted on the back of
male athymic nude mice in a 100 μl mixture (1:1 v/v
of culture medium/matrigel). To determine the growth
inhibitory effect of docetaxel and GDC-0449 alone or
in combination, the treatment was initiated after the
PC3 cell-derived xenografts reached a size of 0.2 cm3.
Briefly, mice were randomly assigned into four groups
of five mice per group. Control mice bearing tumors
received the vehicle alone (DMSO) while other groups
were treated with 50 mg/kg GDC-0449 given orally
(oral gavage) once a day for five days per week and 5
mg/kg docetaxel given intraperitonally (i.p.) two days
by week, for two consecutive weeks. The PC3 cells
