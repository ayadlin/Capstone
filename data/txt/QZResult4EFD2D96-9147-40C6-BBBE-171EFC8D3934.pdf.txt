Abstract
Author Manuscript

Germline polymorphisms in both model organisms and humans influence susceptibility to
complex trait diseases such as inflammation and cancer1,2,3,4. Mice of the Mus spretus species are
resistant to tumor development, and crosses between Mus spretus and susceptible Mus musculus
strains have been used to map locations of genetic variants that contribute to skin cancer
susceptibility4,5,6. We have integrated germline polymorphisms with gene expression in normal
skin from a musculus x spretus backcross to generate a network view of the gene expression
architecture of mouse skin. Here we demonstrate how this approach identifies expression motifs
that contribute to tissue organization and biological functions related to inflammation,
hematopoiesis, cell cycle control and tumor susceptibility. Motifs associated with inflammation,
epidermal barrier function and proliferation are differentially regulated in backcross mice
susceptible or resistant to tumor development. The intestinal stem cell marker Lgr5 is identified as
a candidate master regulator of the hair follicle, and the Vitamin D receptor (Vdr) is linked to
coordinated control of epidermal barrier function, inflammation, and tumor susceptibility.

Skin tumors were induced on the dorsal back skin of 71 spretus / musculus backcross mice
([SPRET/Ei X FVB/N] X FVB/N, hereafter FVBBX mice, see Methods). We performed a
combined correlation and linkage analysis of mRNA expression in uninvolved tail skin to
characterize the genetic architecture of gene expression regulation in FVBBX mice. This
approach identifies genetic loci that influence gene expression (eQTL), with either cis- or
trans-acting effects. Several loci were hot-spots for significant trans-eQTL, including
chromosome 2 at 85 Mb., chromosome 1 at 29 Mb., and chromosome 15 at 73 Mb
(Supplementary Fig. 1). However, not all transcripts influenced by a given locus are
functionally related to each other or co-regulated. We used a network analysis approach to
identify loci that control functionally related groups of genes. We started by representing
FVBBX tail skin RNA expression as a network where significantly correlated transcripts are
drawn as nodes connected by an edge (see Methods). We then identified fully connected
gene sets (cliques) that were enriched for functions of interest (Fig. 1). These sub-networks
were highly enriched for genes representing either structural or functional components of the
skin. These included skin-resident cell types (hair follicles, muscle, melanocytes,
hematopoietic cells) and physiological (e.g. inflammation) or cellular (e.g. cell cycle)
functions (Supplementary Fig. 4, Supplementary Table 3). We next identified the genetic
loci associated with control of these different expression motifs (see Methods).

A network comprising 62 genes, the majority of which are involved in hair follicle biology,
was identified (Fig. 2, Supplementary Table 4). Numerous Type I and Type II hair follicle
keratin genes such as Krt32 and Krt73 were present (Fig. 2A) along with genes involved in
keratin structure and differentiation (Fig. 2C) and many keratin-associated proteins (Fig.
2D). Also identified were Msx2, Dlx3, and Lhx2 (Fig. 2B); these homeobox genes have been
implicated in transcriptional control of hair follicle morphogenesis. Notably, epidermal
keratins such as Krt5 and Krt14 are under separate genetic control and their expression was
not correlated with hair follicle keratins. We extracted epithelial tissue from the tails of
spretus, musculus, and SPRET/Ei X FVB/N mice (hereafter SPRET/Ei, FVB/N, and F1) to
investigate the hypothesis that expression of hair follicle keratins is under complex genetic
control. Expression of Type I and Type II hair follicle keratins was significantly different in
these parental mice: they were approximately 8-fold higher in FVB/N mice than in
SPRET/Ei. Expression of these genes was significantly higher in F1 mice than in either of
the parental strains (Supplementary Fig. 2A), suggesting that expression of these structural
protein genes is under complex genetic control. The transcription factors Dlx3 and Msx2
were also significantly differentially expressed in the same directions.

The eQTLs in this hair follicle network controlling the largest number of genes were located
on chromosome 10 at 118 Mb. (locus Chr10:118Mb) and on chromosome 3 at 19 Mb. (locus
Chr3:19Mb). Inheritance of the SPRET/Ei allele at Chr3:19Mb is associated with higher
expression levels of many genes in this network, while the SPRET/Ei allele on
Chr10:118Mb decreases gene expression. Lgr5 (also known as Gpr49), a member of this
network, is physically located on chromosome 10 at 115 Mb. and has a strong cis-eQTL at
Chr10:118Mb (−Log10P = 4.3, q-value < 0.05, Fig. 2B). Lgr5 is a G-protein-coupled
receptor recently identified as a stem cell marker in colon and small intestine7. Lgr5 is the
only gene with a significant cis-eQTL in this sub-network (the other eQTL effects act in

trans) and Lgr5 is plausibly the causative polymorphic gene on chromosome 10 that
influences expression of these hair follicle genes. Lgr5 microarray results were validated by
Taqman assay, and cis-regulation of Lgr5 expression in F1 mice was verified by a cis-trans
test (Supplementary Fig. 5, 6). Sequencing of Lgr5 coding exons in SPRET/Ei and FVB/N
identified four non-conservative differences between these two species (Supplementary
Table 5). In agreement with this network view of the hair follicle, Lgr5 was recently
identified as a hair follicle stem cell marker by lineage tracing8. Under normal homeostatic
conditions, Lgr5 positive skin cells give rise to lineages of the hair follicle, but not to
sebaceous glands or interfollicular epidermis8.

Our approach also identified motifs associated with genetic control of hematopoietic cells
and melanocytes (Fig. 3A, 3B, Supplementary Tables 6, 7). A hemoglobin production
network including the hemoglobin isoform Hbb-b1, alpha-synuclein (Snca), and
aminolevulinic acid synthase 2 (Alas2) was identified with eQTL that peak on chromosome
7 at 63 and 86 Mb. The observation of eQTL for expression of red blood cell-specific genes
in the skin suggested that specific alleles control the number of skin-resident blood cells.
This could be due to a physiological process that results in a specific homing of
hematopoietic cells to the skins of particular animals, or may reflect increased systemic red
blood cell production that is under genetic control. To test these alternative possibilities we
generated a second FVBBX population (n = 83) and performed QTL analysis on Complete
Blood Count (CBC) parameters (see Methods). Mean Corpuscular Volume showed a highly
significant peak LOD score of 6.8 on chromosome 7 at 79 Mb and Mean Corpuscular
Hemoglobin Content had a peak LOD score of 8.2 on chromosome 7 at 86 Mb (corrected p
values < 0.001, Fig. 3C, 3D). This supports the hypothesis that genetic factors, rather than
environmental factors such as skin inflammation, control blood cell phenotypes in the
circulation and within the skin. It is also likely that variation in the numbers of melanocytes
in the skin is under the control of genetic loci on chromosome 7 (Fig. 3B and Supplementary
Table 7).

We next identified networks associated with susceptibility to the development of skin
tumors. The overall dorsal papilloma count in FVBBX mice after 20 weeks of DMBA / TPA
treatment ranged from 0 to 35 (mean = 5.4, SD = 6.7). We assigned mice with zero
papillomas at 20 weeks to a low susceptibility group and mice with eight or more papillomas
to a high susceptibility group and performed differential expression analysis of tail
epidermal RNA. 371 putative susceptibility genes were identified at a False Discovery Rate
cut-off of 10%. This list was significantly enriched for epidermal keratinization and barrier
function, the mitotic cycle and DNA replication, and interleukin 1 antagonist activity
(Supplementary Table 8). Many genes involved in mitosis and cell proliferation (including
Aurkb, Bub1, Cdca1, Cdca8, Ect2) were significantly co-regulated and associated with
susceptibility, but do not share a statistically significant eQTL in normal skin. This motif
includes Aurora-A, which has previously been identified as a genetic modifier of papilloma
number5.
We identified a locus on distal chromosome 15 (Chr15:101Mb) that influences expression of
many of these genes (Fig. 4, Supplementary Table 9). This susceptibility network includes
IL-1f6 and IL-1f5, ligands for the interleukin-1 receptor that can act positively or negatively

in the inflammatory response, depending on the context9. The interleukin 1 receptor is the
major mediator of inflammation in the skin10. Mice with a SPRET/Ei allele at Chr15:101Mb
had higher expression of inflammation antagonists IL-1f5 and IL-1f6 and lower expression
of pro-inflammatory genes such as Pde4b11. This pattern is compatible with the overall
resistance of Mus spretus to inflammation noted by others12. We observed that higher
expression of inflammation antagonists and lower expression of Pde4b was associated with
high papilloma count, suggesting that in this context the spretus allele increases
susceptibility, counter to the idea that inflammation is invariably associated with increased
tumor susceptibility13,14. However, anti-inflammatory drugs can have contradictory effects
on skin tumor development15 and over-expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as
IL-1 can prevent skin tumor formation in mouse models of chemically induced skin
cancer10. The role of inflammation in skin cancer is therefore highly complex, with possibly
different consequences associated with acute or chronic inflammatory conditions.

Author Manuscript

Several genes related to skin barrier function were highly correlated with the inflammation
network, although genetic linkage to Chr15:101Mb was only detected at a lower level of
stringency than that used for this analysis. These included Rptn and small proline-rich
proteins Sprr2d and Sprr2i, major constituents of the epidermal barrier and cornified cell
envelope. Disruption of skin barrier function leads to inflammation in epithelial tissue16,17,18
but the exact mechanisms linking these processes are unclear. This network also includes the
microbial peptide gene defensin beta 3 (Defb3), implicated in inflammation and psoriasis19
and the anti-microbial calcium-binding gene S100a8, which complexes with S100a9 to form
a pro-inflammatory, anti-bacterial cytokine present in keratinocytes that are inflamed or
infected20.

The best candidate master regulator of this network is the gene encoding the Vitamin D
receptor (Vdr). This gene is physically located on chromosome 15 at 97.7 Mb. and shows a
strong cis-eQTL (−Log10P = 5.8, q-value < 0.001). Sequencing Vdr identified several nonconservative sequence changes between SPRET/Ei and FVB/N in a phosphorylation domain
and the hormone binding domain (Supplementary Fig. 7, 8). Vdr microarray results were
validated by Taqman assay, and cis-regulation of Vdr in F1 mice was verified by a cis-trans
test (Supplementary Fig. 5,6). Low levels of Vdr in FVBBX mice were associated with
higher tumor susceptibility. Epidemiological studies have demonstrated an association
between low serum levels of Vitamin D and human cancer susceptibility, emphasizing an
important role for vitamin D in human cancer prevention21. The vitamin D signaling
pathway has been linked directly to control of skin barrier function22, inflammation and
microbial defense23, and pathways involved in stem cell growth24. Importantly, loss of the
Vdr gene in knockout mice causes the phenotype that would be predicted from the network
shown in Fig. 4, namely increased skin tumor susceptibility25. This suggests that Vdr is a
master regulator of tissue damage and acute inflammation. These results emphasize the
value of integrated systems analysis of polymorphisms and gene expression to identify
groups of interacting genes and candidate master regulators that contribute to individual
cancer susceptibility. Applying this approach to human samples may reveal the major
genetic components of cancer susceptibility that remain to be discovered.

METHODS

Male SPRET/Ei and female FVB/N mice from the Jackson Laboratory were crossed. Female
F1 hybrids were mated to male FVB/N mice. Seventy-one backcross mice (8-12 weeks old)
received a dose of DMBA (25 μg per mouse in 200 μl acetone applied to shaved dorsal back
skin). One week after initiation tumors were promoted with TPA (200 μl of 10−4 M solution
in acetone) twice weekly for 20 weeks. Susceptibility groups were defined by papilloma
count at 20 weeks (Low: zero at 20 weeks, n = 20, High: ≥ 8 at 20 weeks, n=17). Normal tail
skin from FVBBX, SPRET/Ei, FVB/N and F1 mice (4 replicates per group) was snap frozen
at sacrifice. mRNA expression profiles were generated with the Affymetrix M430 2.0
platform. Mice were genotyped using the ABI platform at 223 SNPs. Correlation analysis
(Wilcoxon rank-sum) was performed with 24,357 transcripts expressed above background
levels in FVBBX samples. Eighty-three additional FVBBX mice were generated and CBC
was analyzed using a blood cell counter (HEMAVET; CDC Technologies, CT, USA).
Linkage testing was performed by linear regression. An FDR method that accounts for
signal dependence between loci on the same chromosome26 identified 5% and 10% FDR p
value cut-offs for linkage. CBC QTL were calculated and plotted using R/QTL27, using
1000 permutations to calculate the 5% genome-wide error rate p-value cut-off. Gene
Ontology analysis was performed with BiNGO28. The relevance network used an r2 cut-off
of 0.64 ( < 0.01% alpha level, 1000 permutations). Cliques with at least five members were
identified using a modification of the Bron-Kerbosch algorithm. Network figures were
generated using Cytoscape version 2.5.1 (www.cytoscape.org). Differentially expressed
genes were identified using the Significance Analysis of Microarrays29 with a maximum
FDR of 10%.
