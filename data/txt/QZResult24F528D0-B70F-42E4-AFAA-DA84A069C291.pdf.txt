Abstract
Cancer chromosomal instability (CIN) results in an elevated rate of change of chromosome
number and structure and generates intratumour heterogeneity1,2. CIN is observed in the majority
of solid tumours and is associated with both poor prognosis and drug resistance3,4. Therefore,
understanding a mechanistic basis for CIN is paramount. Here we find evidence for impaired
replication fork progression and elevated DNA replication stress in CIN+ colorectal cancer (CRC)
cells relative to CIN− CRC cells, with structural chromosome abnormalities precipitating
chromosome missegregation in mitosis. We identify three novel CIN-suppressor genes (PIGN
(MCD4), RKHD2 (MEX3C) and ZNF516 (KIAA0222)) encoded on chromosome 18q, which is

subject to frequent copy number loss in CIN+ CRC. 18q loss was temporally associated with
aneuploidy onset at the adenoma-carcinoma transition. CIN-suppressor gene silencing leads to
DNA replication stress, structural chromosome abnormalities and chromosome missegregation.
Supplementing cells with nucleosides, to alleviate replication-associated damage5, reduces the
frequency of chromosome segregation errors following CIN-suppressor gene silencing and
attenuates segregation errors and DNA damage in CIN+ cells. These data implicate a central role
for replication stress in the generation of structural and numerical CIN, which may inform new
therapeutic approaches to limit intratumour heterogeneity.
Structural and numerical chromosomal instability are commonly observed together in solid
tumours (Supplementary Fig. 1a-c)6. This co-occurrence can be experimentally induced via
defective mitotic checkpoint function or chromosome attachment to the mitotic spindle, or
through pre-mitotic defects affecting chromosome structure, such as faulty DNA repair and
replication6-10. However, the mechanisms underlying CIN in cancer remain unclear.

Colorectal cancers can be broadly classified as CIN+/aneuploid or CIN−/microsatellite
unstable3. CIN+ cells displayed an increased frequency of chromosome segregation errors
compared to CIN− cells (median = 38% versus 18%, p=0.0025, Mann-Whitney test,
Supplementary Fig. 2a)11. To address whether mitotic or pre-mitotic mechanisms are
responsible for these segregation errors, we analysed high resolution images of anaphases in
a panel of CIN+ CRC cells. The majority of segregation errors consisted of chromosome
fragments without centromeres (acentrics, Figure 1a) and anaphase bridges (54-81%,
median 70%, Figure 1a,b), indicative of structural chromosome aberrations arising through
pre-mitotic defects12. In contrast, only 10-43% of segregation errors were lagging
chromosomes with centromeres (median 20%, Figure 1a,b), suggesting that mitotic
dysfunction resulting in improper chromosome attachments6 cannot explain the majority of
segregation errors in CIN+ CRC cells (Supplementary Fig. 2b). Furthermore, kinetochore
distortion of lagging chromosomes (reflecting merotelic attachments6) was rare (0-12%,
median 8% of segregation errors, Supplementary Fig. 2c). We did not observe differences in
mitotic timing, mitotic checkpoint function, sister chromatid cohesion or supernumerary
centrioles between CIN+ and CIN− cells, and multipolar spindles were infrequent (0-18%,
median 8%, Supplementary Fig. 2d-i). These data suggest that mitotic dysfunction occurs at
low frequency in CIN+ CRC cells and that the majority of observed chromosome
segregation errors result from structural chromosome aberrations. Accordingly, 22-71%
(median 36%) of CIN+ cell metaphases displayed structurally abnormal chromosomes,
including acentric chromosomes, dicentric chromosomes and DNA double strand breaks
(Figure 1b,c and Supplementary Fig. 2j).
Next we sought a putative cause for these structural chromosome alterations. Activation of
the DNA damage response has been observed in both colorectal adenomas and
carcinomas13,14 and is thought to reflect DNA replication stress13,15,16. Pharmacological
induction of replication stress in HCT-116 (CIN−) cells resulted in structural chromosome
aberrations and segregation errors, 82% of which were bridges or acentric chromosomes
(Supplementary Fig. 3a-f). Importantly, numerical chromosome changes were also induced

DNA replication stress results in a number of cellular phenotypes including DNA damage in
prometaphase10,15,16, ultra-fine anaphase DNA bridges (UFBs)16, and 53BP1-positive
nuclear bodies in G1 cells15,18 (Figure 1d and Supplementary Fig. 3i-m). CIN+ cells
displayed elevated prometaphase DNA damage (median 74% CIN+ versus 34% CIN− cells
with ≥3 γH2AX foci, Figure 1d,e (p=0.033, Mann-Whitney test)) in the absence of increased
oxidative DNA damage (Supplementary Fig. 4a-c). γH2AX foci were not confined to
telomeres (Supplementary Fig. 4d,e). CIN+ cells also displayed more 53BP1 nuclear bodies
in G1 cells (Figure 1d,f, p=0.028, Mann-Whitney test). Consistent with the hypothesis that
replication stress may drive chromosome segregation errors in CIN+ cells, UFBs were
enriched in anaphases with segregation errors compared to anaphases without segregation
errors (Figure 1d,g, p=0.00018, paired t-test).
To assess DNA replication directly, DNA fibre assays were performed for two CIN− and
four CIN+ cell lines, to measure progression of individual replication forks, fork stalling and
asymmetry between sister replication forks. CIN+ cells displayed significantly slower fork
rates relative to CIN− cell lines (0.56-0.83 kb/min compared to 1.11-1.12 kb/min, p<0.05,
Figure 1h,i, Supplementary Fig. 5a,b. Additionally, there was evidence of increased
replication fork stalling and asymmetric sister fork progression in several CIN+ cell lines
(Supplementary Fig. 5c-e), consistent with impaired replication fork progression. These data
indicate that elevated replication stress, as demonstrated using established hallmarks and
direct measurement of replication fork progression, may contribute substantially to
chromosome missegregation in CIN+ CRC cells.

We sought a genetic basis for the elevated replication stress and chromosome segregation
errors in CIN+ cells. Examining whole-exome sequencing data in colorectal tumours from
The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)19, and mutation status for 64 genes in CRC cell lines
(COSMIC), revealed that the only gene mutated at significantly higher frequencies in CIN+
tumours or cell lines was TP53, which is also mutated in 13-33% of CIN− tumours and cell
lines (Supplementary Fig. 6a,b). Mutations in TP53 are thought to be permissive for CIN
rather than causative20. These data suggest that whilst mutations in known oncogenes or
tumour suppressors may contribute to replication stress in cancer cells14,21, these are
unlikely to exclusively account for the elevated replication stress in CIN+ CRC cells. We
therefore addressed whether additional genetic aberrations may contribute to CIN.
We hypothesised that regions of consistent somatic copy number loss in CIN+ CRC might
encode CIN-suppressor genes, loss of which could contribute to the induction of
chromosome missegregation. To identify CIN-specific regions of loss, comparative genomic
hybridisation data (CGH) was analysed for a cohort of 26 aneuploid colorectal tumours and
20 CIN+ cell lines. Chromosome 18q was most frequently subject to copy number loss,
observed in 88% of aneuploid tumours and 80% of CIN+ cell lines, (Figure 2a,b and
Supplementary Table 1) consistent with published studies in CRC and other tumour
types22-24. Copy number losses in CIN+ tumours and cell lines were highly concordant
(p<0.001, Fisher’s exact test, Supplementary Table 2). Next we examined the temporal

sequence and consequences of 18q copy number loss in tumours. In a cohort of 28
adenomas (preinvasive tumour) with carcinoma in the same specimen (Figure 2c), 18q loss
of heterozygosity (LOH - indicative of copy number loss) was observed in 21/28 (75%)
carcinomas, compared to 10/28 (35.7%) adenomas, implicating 18q loss in the adenomacarcinoma transition. 18q LOH was significantly associated with aneuploidy in both
adenomas and carcinomas (Figure 2d, Supplementary Fig. 6c).

Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts

To identify candidate CIN-suppressor genes encoded within regions of recurrent copy
number loss, HCT-116 cells were transfected with pools of four siRNAs targeting the most
frequently lost genes, present at ≤1 copy in at least 30% of CIN+ cell lines (94 genes
encoded on chromosome 18q, Supplementary Table 3). After 48 hours anaphase segregation
errors were quantified (Supplementary Fig. 7a). Importantly, this approach would identify
both mitotic and pre-mitotic defects. SiRNA pools inducing segregation errors to ≥3
standard deviations above the frequency in control-transfected cells were assessed in
validation assays. All sequences targeting PIGN, RKHD2 and ZNF516 induced segregation
errors and efficiently depleted mRNA levels (Supplementary Fig. 7b-d). Additional
independent siRNA sequences targeting each of the three genes also induced segregation
errors (Supplementary Fig. 7e) and these genes were prioritised for further analysis,
although we cannot exclude a contribution of other genes encoded on 18q to CIN. Of note,
RKHD2 is the only protein-coding gene located between two genes implicated in CRC
carcinogenesis, DCC and SMAD4. Copy number loss of PIGN, RKHD2 or ZNF516 is
observed in 85% of the 20 CIN+ cell lines and 84% of aneuploid tumours (n=103) in the
independent TCGA cohort19, with loss of all three genes in 70% of CIN+ cell lines and 79%
of aneuploid tumours (Supplementary Table 4). Importantly, reduced copy number
correlated significantly with reduced mRNA expression for all three genes both in the
TCGA tumour cohort and CRC cell lines (Figure 2e, Supplementary Fig. 8a and
Supplementary Table 5).
We next ensured off-target siRNA effects reported against MAD2 (mitotic checkpoint
protein) and RAD51 (DNA repair protein), were not causing chromosome missegregation
(Supplementary Fig. 8b-e)25. Two RKHD2 sequences partially depleted MAD2 protein, and
were excluded from further analysis. Additionally, expression of exogenous RKHD2-GFP
rescued segregation errors induced upon silencing endogenous RKHD2 using a 3′ UTRtargeted siRNA, and expression of siRNA-resistant PIGN-GFP and ZNF516-GFP reduced
segregation errors induced by depletion of endogenous PIGN or ZNF516 (Supplementary
Fig. 8f). Silencing each CIN-suppressor also induced segregation errors in two additional
CIN− CRC cell lines, DLD1 and RKO, and in 18q-normal CIN+ NCIH508 cells
(Supplementary Fig. 9a-c). Induction of segregation errors was independent of oncogenic
KRAS signalling in HCT-116 cells, as segregation errors were also induced following CINsuppressor gene silencing in a KRAS wild-type isogenic cell line (Supplementary Fig. 9d).
CIN-suppressor gene silencing in HCT-116 cells primarily induced acentric chromosomes
and anaphase bridges (Figure 3a) in the absence of gross mitotic defects (data not shown),
similar to observations in CIN+ CRC cell lines with 18q loss (Figure 1b). This suggested a
pre-mitotic origin for these chromosome segregation errors and accordingly, we observed an
increased frequency of structurally abnormal chromosomes (Figure 3a,b, Supplementary

Fig. 10a). To assess chromosome non-disjunction, HCT-116 cell lines stably expressing
small-hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) were constructed. shRNA-mediated silencing of each CINsuppressor gene increased segregation error frequency (Supplementary Fig. 10b), and single
cell clones grown from each cell line displayed significantly increased intra-colony
deviation for chromosomes 2 and 15 (Figure 3c,d and Supplementary Fig. 10c), indicating
that CIN-suppressor gene silencing induces both structural and numerical instability.
We next examined replication stress following CIN-suppressor gene silencing. Elevated
prometaphase DNA damage was observed (Figure 3e), and this increased concomitantly
with, rather than after, the rise in segregation error frequency (Supplementary Fig. 10d),
supporting the hypothesis that the observed DNA damage reflects a cause, rather than a
consequence, of segregation errors. Silencing each CIN-suppressor gene also resulted in
elevated 53BP1 bodies in G1 cells (Figure 3f), which were unaffected by cytokinesisinhibition, and therefore unlikely to reflect cytokinesis-induced chromosome damage7,15
(Supplementary Fig. 10e-g). Silencing PIGN and ZNF516 also significantly increased the
frequency of UFBs (Figure 3g). Consistent with loss of CIN-suppressor genes contributing
to replication stress in CIN+ cells, transient co-expression of PIGN, RKHD2 and ZNF516
resulted in a partial reduction in G1 53BP1 bodies in 3 CIN+ cell lines with 18q loss
(Supplementary Fig. 11a-d). DNA fibre assays revealed a shift in distribution towards
reduced replication fork speeds upon silencing each of the CIN-suppressor genes in
HCT-116 cells, with reduced average fork rates after silencing PIGN and ZNF516 (Figure
3h,i and Supplementary Fig. 12a,b). Furthermore, we observed increased sister fork
asymmetry after silencing each of the three genes (Supplementary Fig. 12c) consistent with
impaired replication fork progression.

These data suggest that segregation errors resulting from CIN-suppressor gene silencing are
driven by replication stress. To further test this hypothesis, HCT-116 cells transfected with
siRNAs against CIN-suppressor genes were supplemented with nucleosides, previously
shown to reduce replication-induced DNA damage5. Nucleosides significantly reduced the
induction of segregation errors following silencing of PIGN (62% to 32%), RKHD2 (57% to
36%) and ZNF516 (43% to 34%) whilst control segregation errors were unaffected (Figure
4a). We then tested whether nucleoside supplementation could attenuate chromosome
missegregation in CIN+ cell lines with 18q loss. Nucleoside supplementation significantly
reduced segregation error frequency by 45-55% and attenuated prometaphase DNA damage
by 28-43% in four CIN+ cell lines (Figure 4b,c, Supplementary Fig. 13a), indicating
suppression of replication-induced DNA damage and subsequent chromosome
missegregation. The extent of the nucleoside-mediated reduction in segregation errors
implies that de novo generation of structural chromosome aberrations is responsible for a
large proportion of chromosome missegregation events in CIN+ cells. In contrast,
nucleoside supplementation did not affect segregation error frequency in four CIN− cell
lines or 18q-normal CIN+ NCIH508 cells (Supplementary Fig. 13b,c). Nucleoside
supplementation did not affect proliferation, cell cycle distribution, or cellular ATP levels
(Supplementary Fig. 14a-f)5.
In conclusion, our findings implicate replication stress as a major driver of chromosomal
instability in CRC. In addition to impaired replication fork progression, CIN+ cells exhibit

replication stress-associated DNA damage and structurally abnormal chromosomes that
missegregate during mitosis, linking structural and numerical instability. Supplementing
CIN+ cells with nucleosides reduced both DNA damage and segregation errors, supporting a
direct role for replication stress in driving CIN. Given the complex nature of replication
stress and CIN, it is likely that there are multiple genetic aberrations contributing to these
phenotypes within an individual tumour. Here, we suggest a putative genetic mechanism
that may contribute to CIN in CRC, through the recurrent loss of a region on chromosome
18q, encoding three newly identified suppressors of replication stress and chromosome
missegregation. The loss of chromosome 18q in many solid tumour types suggests the
potential contribution of this locus to CIN in tumours beyond CRC. Furthermore, reports of
DNA replication stress across multiple tumour types suggest replication stress may be a
common route to CIN and intratumour heterogeneity13,26. Efforts to target or restrain
replication stress may therefore provide a rational approach to limit tumour diversity,
genome evolution and adaptation.

Plates were imaged using an IncuCyte Long-term in-situ Cell Imaging System, within an
incubator. Phase contrast images were acquired every 2 h for 72 h and % cell monolayer
confluence determined automatically. Outlying wells were excluded, and growth curves
constructed. Growth rates were calculated by measuring the gradient of the linear growth
phase.
ATP measurement
Following nucleoside supplementation, cells were treated with Cell Titer Glo reagent
(Promega). Control measurements were taken from wells with media only±nucleosides.
ATP levels were normalised to the biomass/well (In Vitro Toxicology assay kit
Sulforhodamine B solution – Sigma).
SNP 6.0 array processing
Cell lines: Affymetrix SNP 6.0 data was obtained for 20 CIN+ and 9 CIN− cell lines
(Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute). Integer copy numbers were estimated for each SNP
probe using the PICNIC algorithm31. TCGA: Affymetrix SNP 6.0 data was downloaded for
365 CRC samples and logR ratios and allelic differences were estimated by the Affymetrix
Genotyping Console™. Samples that failed the Affymetrix quality control parameters were
excluded. All tumours with <60% tumour nuclei (based on pathological estimates of
adjacent sections) were excluded. To estimate copy number, the GAP algorithm was used32.
Ploidy was estimated by calculating the weighted median copy number across all copy
number segments, with weights equal to the segment length. Copy number segments of loss
and gain were defined relative to the ploidy status of each sample by subtracting the ploidy
estimate from the estimated copy number of the segment.

Karyotypic Complexity Scores
Structural Complexity Score (SCS): defined as the sum of all structurally aberrant regions.
Regions of intra-chromosomal gain and loss were defined relative to the modal copy number
of the chromosome, and each region counted as one structural aberration. To avoid overestimation, aberrant regions <1 MB were excluded. Numerical complexity score (NCS): the
sum of all whole chromosome gains and losses (chromosomes with >75% of SNP copy
number values higher or lower than the ploidy of the sample were counted as whole
chromosome gains or losses respectively). Multiple copy number events affecting the same
chromosome were scored separately (e.g. −2 copies = 2 chromosome losses). NCS and SCS
scores were divided by 1.5 for triploid cell lines, and by 2 for tetraploid cell lines, to account
for the increased likelihood of karyotypic abnormalities in polyploid genomes. Weighted
genome instability index: As FACS-based DNA index measures were not available for the
TCGA tumours, and information about MSI status was unavailable for a sufficient number
of tumours, an alternative means of classification was required. The genome instability
index (GII)33 is the percentage of SNPs across the genome present at an aberrant copy
number, relative to the baseline ploidy of the sample. We adapted the GII in order to account
for variation in chromosome size, so that large chromosomes do not have a greater effect on
the score than small chromosomes: % aberrant SNPs for each chromosome was calculated

separately and mean % aberration then calculated across all 22 chromosomes. To define a
threshold for CIN− versus CIN+, the weighted GII (wGII) was calculated for the cell lines.
A threshold of 0.2 accurately distinguished CIN+ from CIN−, as previously defined28. The
same threshold was then applied to the TCGA cohort of tumours.

Sequencing data (TCGA)
Preprocessed level 2 somatic mutation data was obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas
Research Network19 for 101 colorectal tumours for which SNP 6.0 copy number data was
also available. All genes with ≤5 somatic mutations were excluded from the analysis.
Colorectal tumours were classified as CIN+ using wGII > 0.2. Somatic mutation data for the
29 colorectal cancer cell lines were obtained from the COSMIC database (http://
cancer.sanger.ac.uk/cancergenome/projects/cosmic/). The association of CIN status with
somatic mutation status of TP53, APC, SMAD4 and KRAS was tested with one-sided
Fisher’s exact tests and the p-values were adjusted for multiple testing with the Benjamini &
Hochberg method34
Defining somatic copy number losses in CIN+ versus CIN− tumours and cell lines

Aneuploid tumours: BAC array-CGH data was obtained for 26 aneuploid tumour samples,
and segmented by circular binary segmention (R package DNAcopy). The GISTIC
algorithm35 was used to identify regions of consistent gain and loss, with thresholds of
0.1/-0.1 for gain/loss respectively, and a q-value threshold of 0.25. Aneuploidy was defined
by flow cytometry (DNA index >1.2). Cell lines: Minimum consistent regions of genomic
alteration across all cell lines were assessed for DNA copy number. Each region in each cell
line was normalized to the ploidy baseline of the cell line to give Xnorm and was then defined
as either lost (copy number < ploidy baseline), or not lost (copy number ≥ ploidy baseline)
and set to 0. Each region was assessed for gain in the same manner. To test for statistical
significance between CIN+ and CIN− cell lines a d-score for each lost region was computed
by calculating the mean normalised copy number Xnorm across CIN+ (mean(Xnorm,C)) and
CIN− (mean(Xnorm,M)) cell lines, thereby accounting for both amplitude and frequency of
genomic aberrations. A Significance Analysis of Microarrays (SAM – R package siggenes)
was then performed with a modified two-sample t-statistic:

The parameter s(i) defines the region-specific standard deviation36. In contrast to a standard
two-sample t-statistic, SAM includes an additional parameter s0, which decreases the
influence of high sample variance. This was empirically set to 0.5, resulting in a balanced
weighting of frequency and amplitude. To detect significant regions, we randomly permuted
(N = 10000) SNP probes for each sample separately. To save computation time, we
randomly drew copy numbers for each sample, setting the probability for a given copy
number to the percentage of SNP probes showing this copy number level across the genome.
For each tested region, p-values were estimated by counting the percentage of permutation
d-scores greater or equal than the observed d-score. To adjust for multiple testing, q-values

were estimated with the R-package qvalue and genes with q<0.25 were called significant. To
ensure selection of genes consistently altered across CIN+ cell lines, genomic changes not
seen in ≥50% of cell lines were excluded from further analysis. Genes were then mapped to
regions using the R package biomaRt37. All genes present at ≤1 copies in ≥30% of CIN+
cell lines, and no more than 1 CIN− cell line, were selected for functional investigation.

Carcinoma-in-adenoma samples

20 archival FFPE tumours showing adjacent but discrete colorectal carcinoma and adenoma
were identified. Samples and records were used in accordance with UK research ethics
approval (MREC06/Q1702/99). H&E slides of the samples were reviewed, regions marked
as normal (if present)/adenoma/carcinoma. and used as a guide to take tissue from each
region from unstained slides by needle microdissection. DNA was extracted with standard
proteinase K digestion, and purified (DNeasy kit - Qiagen). Ploidy analysis was performed
using automated image-based cytometry (Fairfield Imaging, Nottingham, UK) as previously
described38,39. LOH analysis: SNP arrays: The Illumina Sentrix Beadarray human linkage
mapping panel version IVb was used according to the Goldengate genotyping assay
instructions (Illumina, San Diego, USA). DNA was amplified, fragmented and hybridized to
the Beadchip, followed by single-base extension. Beadchips were stained, dried and scanned
using a Beadarray reader (Illumina, San Diego, USA). Image data were visualised using
Genomestudio (Illumina, San Diego, USA). All samples had call rates above 0.97.
Adenomas and carcinomas were marked as having LOH or no LOH in 18q according to the
absence or presence of heterozygous alleles respectively. LOH analysis using
microsatellites: Standard PCR conditions were used with the forward primer fluorescently
labelled with HEX or FAM. At each marker, LOH was considered present when a peak area
in the adenoma or the carcinoma was reduced to 50% of the other allele, relative to the
normal paired DNA. Up to 5 microsatellites in 18q21 (D18S46, D18S1110, D18S35,
D18S69 and D18S1407) were analysed. All PCRs were performed twice and all samples
analysed with SNP arrays had concordant results.
Gene expression analysis
TCGA: Agilent 244K custom gene expression (G4502A-07-3) data was downloaded for
154 CRC samples and was print-tip normalised with the R-package marray. Duplicated
probes were averaged. Cell lines: Affymetrix HT-HGU133A microarray data for 20 CIN+
and 9 CIN− cell lines was obtained from the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute. The data was
RMA normalized with the R-package affy. Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient was used
for the correlation of copy number and expression data.
