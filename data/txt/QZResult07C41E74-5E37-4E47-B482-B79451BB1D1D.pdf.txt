Abstract
The purpose of this study was to examine the therapeutic
efficacy and underlying mechanisms of action of a vasculardisrupting agent, AVE8062, and to determine its effects on
tumor metabolic activity. The in vitro and in vivo effects of
AVE8062 alone and in combination with docetaxel were tested
in chemotherapy-sensitive and chemotherapy-resistant ovarian cancer models. Tumors were analyzed for necrosis, microvessel density, endothelial cell apoptosis, and proliferation
following treatment. The effect of AVE8062 on tumor regression and metabolic activity was examined by magnetic resonance (MR) or by [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose ([18F]FDG) uptake
by positron emission tomography (PET) with MR imaging,
respectively. AVE8062 monotherapy was effective in inhibiting
tumor growth in all models (range 43–51% versus control;
P < 0.05). Combination therapy was even more effective in
inhibiting tumor growth (range 76–90% compared with
controls, P < 0.01). AVE8062 in combination with chemotherapy significantly prolonged survival in HeyA8-injected mice
(P < 0.001) compared with other groups. AVE8062-based
therapy resulted in rapid development of central tumor
necrosis, decreased microvessel density, decreased proliferation, and induction of apoptosis of tumor-associated endothelial cells. MR imaging showed regression of established HeyA8
ovarian tumors and [18F]FDG PET with MR showed rapid
decrease in metabolic activity after AVE8062 therapy. Combination of AVE8062 plus docetaxel results in potent inhibition
of ovarian cancer growth. These results suggest that AVE8062
may be useful as a clinical therapeutic approach for ovarian
cancer patients and that functional [18F]FDG PET imaging may
predict clinical response before an anatomic reduction in
tumor size. [Cancer Res 2007;67(19):9337–45]

Introduction
Ovarian cancer remains the most common cause of death from a
gynecologic malignancy. In 2007, it is estimated that over 22,430
women will develop ovarian cancer and 15,280 will die as a result

(1). The high mortality associated with ovarian cancer is thought to
be due to the advanced stage of disease at presentation. Despite
improvements in surgical and chemotherapeutic approaches, most
patients develop recurrent disease, where long-term survival rates
remain dismal. Thus, novel therapeutic strategies are needed to
improve the outcome of this deadly disease.
It is well established that tumor cells depend on the presence of
a functional blood vessel network for their growth, survival, and
metastatic spread (2, 3). Tumor vasculature is a promising target
for novel anticancer agents because endothelial cells are thought to
be genetically stable compared with tumor cells. In addition, tumor
vasculature seems to be functionally different from normal
vasculature. For example, tumor vessels exhibit a more tortuous
course, greater leakiness, and disorganized blood flow (4). Thus,
targeting the phenotypic differences between tumor and normal
vasculature is attractive because it has the potential to be effective
against bulky established tumors, which are often considered to be
resistant to conventional chemotherapy. Vascular-disrupting
agents (VDA) are a relatively new class of drugs that cause a rapid
and extensive shutdown of established tumor vasculature, leading
to secondary tumor cell death characterized by early and extensive
tumor cell necrosis (5).
Combretastatin A-4 (CA-4; refs. 6–8), its disodium phosphate salt
(CA-4 prodrug; refs. 9, 10), ZD6126 (prodrug of N-acetylcolchinol;
ref. 11), and AVE8062 (a derivative of CA-4 prodrug; ref. 12) are
tubulin-binding agents that belong to a new family of small
molecular weight drugs possessing potent antivascular properties
(6–10). They are structurally related to the colchicines, which are
a class of naturally occurring toxic alkaloids whose biological
function seems to occur through microtubule polymerization.
Although the specific mechanisms underlying the antivascular
effects of this new class of agents are not fully understood, similar
properties have been seen with other tubulin-binding microtubuledisrupting agents such as the Vinca alkaloids (5) and the taxanes
(13). The effects of these agents include morphologic alterations in
endothelial cells mediated by disruption and reorganization of
microtubules, and a rapid increase in tumor vascular permeability
mediated by disruption and reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton (6–10). However, it is not fully known whether such vasculartargeting agents also have direct effects on tumor cells. Thus, in the
current study, we considered both the antivascular and antitumor
effects of AVE8062. The therapeutic efficacy of AVE8062 was
examined alone and in combination with standard chemotherapy
in multiple orthotopic models of ovarian cancer. Furthermore, to
assess whether early functional imaging could predict therapeutic
response to AVE8062, we used [18F]FDG positron emission tomography (PET) imaging.

Materials and Methods
Cell lines and culture. The ovarian cancer cell lines HeyA8 and
SKOV3ip1 (14) were maintained in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 15% fetal
bovine serum (FBS) and 50 Ag/mL gentamicin sulfate (Gemini Bioproducts).
The HeyA8-MDR cell line, a taxane-resistant line (a kind gift from Dr. Isaiah
J. Fidler, Department of Cancer Biology, University of Texas M. D. Anderson
Cancer Center, Houston, TX), was maintained in the above medium with
300 Ag/mL of paclitaxel. Endothelial cells isolated from the mesentery of the
immortomouse [mouse mesenteric endothelial cell (MMEC)] were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS and 0.01% gentamicin sulfate.
These cells proliferate indefinitely by means of SV40 transformation at
33jC, but not at 37jC (15). Before the experiments, these cells were kept at
37jC for 48 h to allow elimination of SV40 expression. All cell lines were
routinely screened for Mycoplasma species (GenProbe detection kit; Fisher).
All experiments were done with 70% to 80% confluent cultures.
Orthotopic in vivo model and tissue processing. Female athymic nude
mice (6–8 weeks old) were purchased from the National Cancer InstituteFrederick Cancer Research and Development Center and housed in specific
pathogen-free conditions. They were cared for in accordance with
guidelines set forth by the American Association for Accreditation of
Laboratory Animal Care and the USPHS Policy on Human Care and Use of
Laboratory Animals; and all studies were approved and supervised by the
M. D. Anderson Cancer Center Institutional Animal Care and Use
Committee. For in vivo injection, tumor cells were trypsinized, centrifuged
at 1,000 rpm  7 min at 4jC, washed twice, and resuspended in serum-free
HBSS (Life Technologies) at a concentration of 5  106 cells/mL (SKOV3ip1
and HeyA8-MDR) and 1.25  106 cells/mL (HeyA8). Tumors were
established by i.p. injection of cells. AVE8062 (Sanofi-Aventis) therapy was
initiated 7 or 17 days after cell line injection. Mice (n = 10 per group) were
randomly assigned to the following treatment groups: (a) PBS 200 AL, i.p.
weekly; (b) AVE8062 30 mg/kg [dissolved in PBS (pH 5)] i.p. twice weekly;
(c) docetaxel 2 mg/kg (HeyA8 and HeyA8-MDR) or 1.4 mg/kg (SKOV3ip1)
i.p. weekly; (d) AVE8062 plus docetaxel (both drugs given at the doses and
frequency described above for each drug alone). The dose of AVE8062 used
in these experiments was optimized from dose-escalation studies against
tumor growth. Mice were monitored for signs of adverse effects and tumors
were harvested after treatment (range 2–5 weeks). The mouse weight,
tumor weight, number of tumor nodules, and volume of ascites were
recorded at necropsy.
Immunohistochemistry. Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded sections
were deparaffinized in xylene, rehydrated in graded alcohol, and transferred
to PBS. After citrate buffer (pH 6.0) antigen retrieval, endogenous
peroxidase was blocked with 3% hydrogen peroxide in methanol for
12 min. Nonspecific epitopes were blocked with fragment block (1:10,
Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories) overnight at 4jC. After additional
blocking with 5% normal horse serum (NHS) and 1% normal goat serum
(NGS) at room temperature, sections were incubated with the monoclonal
mouse anti–PCNA (proliferating cell nuclear antigen)-PC10 antibody (1:50;
DAKO) at room temperature for 3 h followed by incubation with horseradish peroxidase (HRP)–conjugated rat anti-mouse IgG2a (1:100, Serotec,
Harlan Bioproducts for Science, Inc.) for 1 h at room temperature. PCNA
was determined by the percentage of PCNA-positive cells in 10 highpowered fields at 100.
Terminal deoxyribonucleotide transferase (TdT)–mediated nick-end
labeling (TUNEL) staining was done after deparaffinization and treatment
with proteinase K (1:500). One slide with DNase (1:50) was used as a positive
control. All slides were then treated with 3% H2O2/methanol for 12 min,
rinsed with distilled water, and then incubated with TdT buffer for 2 min.
Next, samples were incubated with terminal transferase (1:400) and biotin16-dUTP (1:200) in TdT buffer at 37jC for 1 h. After blocking with 2% bovine
serum albumin, visualization was achieved with peroxidase streptavidin
(1:400, DAKO) at 37jC for 40 min. TUNEL was quantified by the number of
TUNEL-positive cells in 10 randomly selected samples at 100.
CD31 immunohistochemistry was done on freshly cut frozen sections.
After fixation with cold acetone, acetone + chloroform (1:1), and acetone,
samples were incubated with 1:800 of rat monoclonal anti-mouse CD31

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (19). October 1, 2007

(1:800, PharMingen) overnight at 4jC followed by HRP-conjugated goat
anti-rat IgG (1:200, Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories). Visualization
was achieved with 3,3¶-diaminobenzidine (Research Genetics) and counterstaining with Gil’s hematoxylin (BioGenex Laboratories). Microvessel
density was quantified by the number of lumen-like structures adjacent
to CD31-positive endothelial cells. All images were captured using a threechip camera (Sony Corporation) and the Optimas Image Analysis software
(Bioscan).
Confocal immunofluorescence for CD31 (endothelial cells) and
TUNEL (apoptotic cells). Eight-micrometer-thick frozen tissues were fixed
in cold acetone, acetone/chloroform (1:1), and acetone, followed by
blocking with 5% NHS and 1% NGS in PBS for 20 min at room temperature.
Sections were then incubated with rat anti-CD31 antibody (1:400,
PharMingen) for 18 h at 4jC and then with Texas red AffiniPure goat IgG
(1:200, Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories). After washing with PBS and
PBS + 0.1% Brij, TUNEL staining was done on the same samples using a
commercially available apoptosis detection kit (DeadEnd Fluorometric
TUNEL System, Promega Corporation). Samples were fixed with 4%
paraformaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature, washed with PBS, then
incubated with 0.2% Triton X-100 for 15 min and with equilibration buffer
for 10 min. Next, sections were incubated for 1 h in a 37jC darkened
humidity chamber with nucleotide mix and TdT enzyme in equilibration
buffer. The reaction was terminated by immersing the samples in 2 SSC
for 15 min. Unincorporated fluorescein dUTP was removed, and samples
were then incubated with 100 ng/mL of Hoechst stain for 10 min to quantify
endothelial cells. Immunofluorescence microscopy was done using a 20
objective (Zeiss Plan-Neofluar) on an epifluorescence microscope (Ludl
Electronic Products). Images were captured using a cooled charge-coupled
device camera (Photometrics) and Smart Capture software (Digital
Scientific). Endothelial cells were identified by red fluorescence, and DNA
fragmentation was detected by localized green and yellow fluorescence
within the nucleus of apoptotic endothelial cells. Quantification of
apoptotic endothelial cells was expressed as an average of the ratio of
apoptotic endothelial cells to the total number of endothelial cells in 10
randomly selected 0.039-mm2 fields at 200.
In vitro cytotoxicity assay. Two thousand tumor cells were seeded into
38-mm2 wells of flat-bottomed 96-well plates in triplicate and allowed to
adhere overnight. Cultures were then washed and regular medium (negative
control) or medium containing docetaxel with or without AVE8062 were
added. After 72 h, the number of metabolically active cells was determined
by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT)
assay. Dose-response curves for growth inhibition were generated as a
percentage of untreated control. IC50 was determined by nonlinear leastsquares regression (Prism, Graph Pad Software, Inc.). Combination assays
were done by using the IC50 of AVE8062 (7–20 nmol/L, depending on the
cell line) with escalating doses of docetaxel. To assess the potential effect of
combination AVE8062 and docetaxel therapy relative to either agent alone,
dose-response curves were compared. The null hypothesis was that the IC50
values were shared. To confirm a differential benefit for the combination,
the curves were reanalyzed constraining the IC50 to the best performing
single agent.
Analysis of cell cycle and apoptosis by flow cytometry. The capacity
of AVE8062 to modulate MMEC and HeyA8 cell cycle as well as apoptosis
was analyzed by flow cytometry. In all assays, 3  106 tumor cells were
seeded into Petri dishes and allowed to adhere overnight. The cultures were
then washed with PBS and treated with regular medium (negative control)
or medium containing docetaxel, AVE8062 (HeyA8, 20 nmol/L; MMEC
10 nmol/L), or AVE8062 plus docetaxel. For cell cycle analyses, tumor cells
were collected by trypsinization and pooled with the cells floating in the
medium. The cell suspensions were centrifuged for 5 min at 1,500 rpm at
room temperature, then washed and fixed with ethanol. For apoptosis
analysis, cells were incubated overnight in 50 AL of DNA labeling solution
(10 AL of reaction buffer, 0.75 AL of TdT enzyme, 8 AL of FITC-dUTP, and
32.25 AL of distilled water) at room temperature. Following the addition of
rinse buffer, samples were centrifuged, washed, and fixed in ethanol. All
samples were then washed with PBS, then resuspended in propidium iodide
(50 Ag/mL) and RNase A (20 Ag/mL) in PBS for 30 min at room

temperature. Stained cells were analyzed on an EPICS XL flow cytometer
(Beckman-Coulter). The low-level gate was set at the base of the G1 peak
and the percentages of cells within the G1 and G2-M phases of the cell cycle
were determined by analysis with Multicycle (Phoenix Flow Systems).
Magnetic resonance imaging of i.p. tumor. Initial magnetic resonance
(MR) imaging of i.p. tumors was done 14 to 15 days after injection of 2.5 
105 HeyA8 tumor cells. On day 17, treatment with AVE8062 (30 mg/kg, i.p.,
twice weekly) was initiated. To assess the effect on tumor growth after
AVE8062 treatment, repeat MR imaging was done on days 24 to 25. All mice
were sacrificed 1 to 2 days after MR imaging to record tumor weight. Weight
derived from MR images was correlated with weight measured ex vivo. For
all MR imaging experiments, animals were anesthetized with 2% isoflurane.
Imaging was done in a 4.7-T small-animal MR scanner (Biospec, Bruker
Biospin Corp.). A T2-weighted fast spin echo sequence (echo time, 70 ms;
repetition time, 2,088 ms; nex 3; field of view, 3.7  5 cm; matrix, 256  256;
spatial resolution, 195 Am) was used to acquire images in sagittal and
coronal planes. Using the Image J program (NIH), tumor measurements
were done using coronal images. Regions of interest (ROI) were drawn on
each image containing tumor and then multiplied by slice thickness to
obtain the tumor volume. If the tumor was seen in several slices, then
tumor volumes were added together. To control for volume averaging, one
half of the volume of tumor from the most dorsal and ventral images
containing the tumor was used in the volume analysis. Assuming a tumor
density of 1 g/mL, tumor volumes (mm3) were converted to weight in grams
for analysis (16). The serial imaging allowed longitudinal evaluation of each
tumor. The weight of each tumor on day 25 was subtracted from the weight
of the same tumor on day 15 to obtain the difference in tumor weight.
MR and PET imaging of i.p. tumor. After AVE8062 treatment, MR and
PET imaging were done 19 to 20 days after i.p. injection of 2.5  105 HeyA8
cells. On day 21, [18F]FDG PET imaging was done. The next day, mice were
treated with a single dose of AVE8062 (30 mg/kg i.p.) or PBS (n = 5–8 mice
per group) and PET imaging was done serially 2 and 24 h after treatment.
Mice were sacrificed after final PET imaging and tumor weights were
recorded.
For all PET imaging, anesthetized mice were injected i.v. with 150 ACi of
[18F]FDG. Thirty minutes later, animals anesthetized with 2% isofluorane
were imaged for 15 min using a microPET Rodent R4 scanner (Concorde
Microsystems, Inc.). Images were reconstructed using OSEM2D (Ordered
Subsets Expectation Maximization) software provided by the manufacturer.
ROI (counts per pixel per minute) were converted to microcuries using a
calibration curve derived from scanning standard activity phantoms in the
microPET scanner. [18F]FDG uptake by each tumor was divided by the
weight of the tumor derived from MR imaging to obtain %ID/g for each
mouse.
Statistical analysis. Comparisons of tumor weight and quantification of
PCNA, TUNEL, CD31, percentage of necrotic portion, and percentage of
apoptotic endothelial cells were analyzed by two-tailed Student’s t test or
ANOVA ( for all groups) if normally distributed, and the Mann-Whitney rank
sum test or Kruskal-Wallis test ( for all groups) if nonparametric. Differences
between groups were considered statistically significant if P < 0.05. For
in vivo therapy experiments, 10 mice in each group were used based on a
power analysis to detect a 50% reduction in tumor size (b error 0.2).
Survival curves were plotted using the Kaplan-Meier method and compared
with the log-rank test. Linear regression was used to analyze correlations of
tumor weight derived by MR versus that of excised tumors.

Results
In vivo efficacy of AVE8062. Before performing therapy
experiments, we tested the tolerability of various doses of
AVE8062 ranging from 10 to 100 mg/kg given twice weekly via
i.v., i.p., or s.c. routes in nude mice (n = 3 per group). The i.v. and
s.c. routes were not pursued further due to problems with skin or
tail vein necrosis. The i.p. route was well tolerated with doses up to
100 mg/kg. Next, preliminary experiments were done to determine
the lowest dose for in vivo therapeutic efficacy. Starting 7 days after

www.aacrjournals.org

tumor cell injection, nude mice (n = 5 per group) bearing HeyA8
ovarian cancer cells were treated with either vehicle or AVE8062
10, 30, 50, and 100 mg/kg twice weekly i.p. for 3 weeks. There was
65% reduction in tumor weight in the 30 mg/kg group compared
with the vehicle control group (P < 0.02; data not shown). The
10 mg/kg dose was not effective. The antitumor effects at doses
>30 mg/kg were not significantly better; therefore, the 30 mg/kg
dose was selected for subsequent therapy experiments.
Effect of AVE8062 and docetaxel on ovarian tumor growth
in vivo. To determine the therapeutic potential of AVE8062,
extensive analyses were done using orthotopic models of advanced
ovarian cancer. To simulate advanced disease, therapy was
initiated 1 week (early treatment) after tumor cell injection, with
animals divided into four groups (10 mice per group): (a) vehicle
alone; (b) AVE8062 30 mg/kg twice weekly; (c) docetaxel 2 mg/kg
(HeyA8 and HeyA8-MDR) or 1.4 mg/kg (SKOV3ip1) weekly; and (d)
AVE8062 plus docetaxel (both drugs given at the doses and
frequency described above for each drug alone). The mice were
treated for 3 to 5 weeks (depending on the cell line tested) and
sacrificed when the mice in the control group were moribund. In
the HeyA8 model, AVE8062 treatment alone resulted in 43%
reduction in tumor size compared with control (P = 0.04) and
docetaxel alone resulted in 68% reduction (P = 0.03; Fig. 1A). In
comparison, the combination therapy had the greatest efficacy,
resulting in 86% inhibition (P = 0.008). Similar results were noted
with the SKOV3ip1 model, with 45% reduction in tumor growth
with AVE8062 alone (P = 0.01) and 90% reduction in combination with docetaxel (P < 0.001; Fig. 1A).
Despite high response rates to primary chemotherapy, most
ovarian cancer patients eventually develop recurrent disease, which
becomes refractory to chemotherapy (17). Therefore, we also
examined the effects of AVE8062 on the taxane-resistant HeyA8MDR cell line. In this model, AVE8062 treatment alone reduced
tumor growth by 51% (P = 0.008) compared with the controls
(Fig. 1A). As expected, docetaxel treatment alone did not alter
tumor growth. However, the combination of AVE8062 with docetaxel was superior to all other groups in inhibiting tumor growth
(76%; P < 0.001).
Given that many patients with recurrent ovarian cancer have
bulky disease, we next evaluated the effects of AVE8062 in mice
with a larger HeyA8 tumor burden. For these experiments,
treatment was started 17 days after tumor cell injection (palpably
f0.75 cm tumors). AVE8062 treatment resulted in a 35% reduction
in tumor burden (P = 0.04), but docetaxel alone had no effect.
However, even in this model of bulkier disease, the combination
treatment resulted in 80% smaller tumor size versus vehicle control
(P = 0.001; Fig. 1A).
Based on the encouraging results with regard to in vivo tumor
growth inhibition, we next examined the effects of single-agent
AVE8062, docetaxel, and combination AVE8062/docetaxel on
survival. In this experiment, therapy was initiated 1 week after
HeyA8 inoculation and continued until each animal became
moribund. AVE8062 alone did not improve survival compared
with control (Fig. 1B). However, docetaxel alone and in combination with AVE8062 yielded a significant survival advantage over
control or AVE8062 alone (P < 0.001). Treatment with both drugs
(AVE8062 and docetaxel) was well tolerated, and there were no
significant differences in mouse body weight between the groups
tested (data not shown).
Assessment of tumor size (MR imaging) and metabolism
([18F]FDG PET). We used longitudinal MR imaging to determine

Figure 1. Therapeutic efficacy of AVE8062 with docetaxel. A, nude mice inoculated i.p. with either HeyA8, SKOV3ip1, or HeyA8-MDR were randomly allocated
to one of the following groups (n = 10 per group), with therapy beginning 1 wk after tumor cell injection: vehicle control, AVE8062, docetaxel, and AVE8062 + docetaxel.
For experiments with HeyA8-formed tumors (HeyA8-bulky ), treatment was started 17 d after tumor cell inoculation. The animals were sacrificed when control
mice became moribund (3–5 wks after start of treatment). B, Kaplan-Meier survival of HeyA8-inoculated mice based on the four therapy groups noted above (n = 10 per
group). The equality of survival curves was tested using the log-rank statistic.

the effects of AVE8062 on formed tumors (Fig. 2A). We first
measured tumor size and weight using MR imaging 14 to 15 days
after i.p. injection of HeyA8 tumor cells and 10 days after initiation
of AVE8062 30 mg/kg i.p. twice weekly. Tumor weight derived from
MR imaging on days 24 to 25 correlated highly with that from
excised tumors (r = 0.97, P < 0.001, n = 12; Fig. 2B). Treated mice
showed significant reductions in tumor size compared with control
(P < 0.01, n = 6 per group; Fig. 2C), suggesting that AVE8062 is
indeed effective in the treatment of bulkier tumors.
Based on the known ability of AVE8062 to induce vascular
collapse, we next asked whether this would also result in a rapid
decrease in the metabolic activity of tumors, as assessed by
[18F]FDG PET. To assess tumor weight, nude mice bearing HeyA8
tumors (n = 6) were imaged on days 19 to 20 by MR. For functional
imaging, a baseline [18F]FDG PET examination was done 21 days
after tumor implantation. The next day, AVE8062 30 mg/kg was
given i.p. and imaging was repeated at 2 and 24 h after treatment.
The [18F]FDG uptake by PET and tumor weight derived by MR were
used to determine %ID/g for each tumor at the pretreatment, 2 and
24 h time points after AVE8062 therapy. At 2 and 24 h, %ID/g
decreased by 83% (P < 0.01) and 82% (P < 0.01), respectively, compared with pretreatment for the AVE8062-treated animals (Fig. 2D);
however, no difference was noted in the vehicle-treated control
group.
Antivascular effects of AVE8062. To evaluate potential
mechanisms to explain the efficacy of AVE8062, we examined the
extent of tumor necrosis, microvessel density (CD31), proliferation
(PCNA), and apoptosis (TUNEL) in tumors from either the therapy
experiments described above or short-term experiments done
separately. To quantitate the extent of necrosis, the entire excised
tumor was fixed, stained with H&E, and scanned. The necrotic

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (19). October 1, 2007

portion was quantified by pixel counts after a single dose of
AVE8062 alone or in combination with docetaxel in mice bearing
formed HeyA8 ovarian tumors (17 days after i.p. injection of tumor
cells). AVE8062 monotherapy resulted in f30% necrosis compared
with 7.7% in the controls (P = 0.01; Fig. 3A). The combination of
docetaxel and AVE8062 resulted in the greatest necrosis (74%
necrosis; P < 0.001). We also examined the extent of necrosis in the
SKOV3ip1 model (has numerous, but smaller, modules compared
with the HeyA8 model) and observed significant necrosis in both of
the AVE8062 treatment groups (Supplementary Fig. S1). Based on
the known effects of AVE8062 on endothelial cells, we next
determined microvessel density in tumors harvested after 3 weeks
of therapy. There was a 54% decrease in microvessel density with
AVE8062 monotherapy (P = 0.02), and a 68% decrease when
combination therapy was used (P < 0.001; Fig. 3B). To determine
whether the effects of AVE8062 on endothelial cells were direct, we
assessed for endothelial cell apoptosis using dual colocalization of
CD31 and TUNEL. Initially, we found no apoptotic endothelial cells
in tumors harvested after prolonged therapy (data not shown). It is
likely that detecting apoptotic tumor-associated endothelial cells
may be difficult after multiple doses of therapy because the
majority of AVE8062-sensitive cells would have been affected
during earlier treatments (18). Therefore, we examined the effects
of AVE8062 therapy on tumors harvested 48 h after a single dose.
There was a substantial increase in endothelial cell apoptosis after
AVE8062 treatment (Fig. 3C; P < 0.001) compared with vehicle
control or docetaxel alone. The effect of combination therapy was
even more pronounced (P < 0.001) at this earlier time point. The
effects of therapy on tumor cell apoptosis were also examined in
all four groups. As expected, the greatest effect on tumor cell
apoptosis was noted in the combination group (Fig. 3D; P < 0.001)

compared with controls. We also evaluated major organs, including
kidney, spleen, liver, heart, and lung, for endothelial cell apoptosis
after AVE8062 treatment. There was no significant increase in
endothelial apoptosis (<1%) in these organs (Supplementary
Fig. S2).
Direct effects of AVE8062 on tumor cells. Although the effects
of AVE8062 on endothelial cells are known, we next asked whether
this agent also has direct effects on ovarian cancer cells. To answer
this question, we examined the effects of AVE8062 on endothelial
or tumor cell viability using the MTT assay. The IC50 of AVE8062 for
the MMECs was 10 nmol/L and ranged between 7 and 20 nmol/L
for the tumor cell lines (HeyA8, SKOV3ip1, and HeyA8-MDR), as
shown in Fig. 4A. Comparative analysis of the nonlinear leastsquares regression of the dose-response curves for each agent alone
and combination AVE8062/docetaxel showed a significantly lower
IC50 than either agent alone (P < 0.005, all cell lines). The
cytotoxicity of docetaxel was 2- to 4-fold greater in combination
with AVE8062 for the endothelial and tumor cells compared with
docetaxel alone (Fig. 4A). The effects of AVE8062 on in vivo
proliferation were assessed in tumors harvested from the therapy
experiments described above using PCNA stains. Representative

pictures and mean PCNA counts are presented in Fig. 4B. The
control tumors had 53% proliferating tumor cells compared
with 34% in the AVE8062 group (P = 0.03) and 24% in the docetaxel group (P = 0.005). Tumors treated with combination showed
an even greater reduction in proliferation rate (15%), which is
significantly reduced compared with either treatment alone
(P < 0.001). These findings indicate that the in vivo effects on
proliferation are likely reflective of both antitumor and antiendothelial effects.
AVE8062 causes G2-M phase arrest. To determine potential
mechanisms of AVE8062-induced cell death, we examined cell
cycle and apoptosis using flow cytometry in endothelial and tumor
cells. In mesenteric endothelial cells, treatment with AVE8062
resulted in G2-M arrest of 60% within 8 h compared with 13% for
controls (P < 0.001; Fig. 5A). In HeyA8 cells, the increase in G2-M
arrest was observed at a later time (60% at 24 h, P < 0.01 compared
with vehicle control; Fig. 5B). As expected, AVE8062 alone and in
combination with docetaxel resulted in a significant increase in
MMEC apoptosis compared with the vehicle control or docetaxelalone groups (P < 0.01; Fig. 5C). In the HeyA8 cell line, increase in
apoptosis was observed at a later time (48 h; P < 0.01; Fig. 5D).

Discussion
In the present study, we have shown that the vascular-targeting
agent AVE8062 in combination with a conventional cytotoxic
agent, docetaxel, is highly efficacious in ovarian carcinoma. The
efficacy was documented in both developing and established
tumors in multiple orthotopic ovarian cancer mouse models. These
effects are due to direct effects on both tumor and associated
endothelial cells. Furthermore, [18F]FDG PET imaging predicted
tumor response as early as 2 h after AVE8062 therapy. These
results are clinically relevant as a significant unmet need in the
management of ovarian cancer is novel agent discovery, which has
the potential to overcome intrinsic and acquired drug resistance to
conventional cytotoxic chemotherapy, particularly in established
and often bulky tumor nodules. In addition, if validated in humans,

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (19). October 1, 2007

early measures of efficacy for this class of agents can protect
patients from receiving multiple courses of ineffective therapy.
The efficacy of VDAs such as CA-4 phosphate and ZD6126 has
been reported in some preclinical models, including colon and lung
cancer (19–21). Previous reports evaluating the combination of
VDAs and conventional chemotherapy have shown enhanced
tumor response without an apparent increase in host toxicity
(22–35). For instance, Goto et al. (25) reported that ZD6126
combined with cisplatin significantly reduced tumor weight and
number of metastatic nodules in a human lung cancer orthotopic
model without concomitant organ toxicity. Similarly, Seimann and
Rojiani (23, 24) documented antitumor efficacy of ZD6126
combined with cisplatin in a s.c. rodent sarcoma and human renal
cancer model. The current report is the first to evaluate the

antitumoral effects of AVE8062 alone and in combination with
docetaxel in an orthotopic model of ovarian cancer.
AVE8062 is a derivative of CA-4 phosphate, which is known to
exhibit antivascular effects through selective disruption of the
tubulin cytoskeleton of endothelial cells (11, 36–38). The molecular
mechanisms underlying these effects are not well characterized;
however, microtubule targeting activates the mitotic spindle checkpoint that monitors chromosome attachment to the mitotic spindle
and delays chromosome segregation during anaphase until defects
in the mitotic spindle apparatus are corrected. Because mitotic
arrest (G2M) induced by VDAs frequently precedes apoptosis, it is
widely hypothesized that this arrest is the primary stimulus for

apoptosis (36–38). In addition to this direct cytotoxic effect, an
antivascular mechanism seems to be mediated via endothelial cell
cytoskeletal reorganization and cell shape changes resulting in
vascular collapse, increased permeability, and decreased tumor
perfusion. Direct effects on tumor cells have been suggested in vivo,
but to the best of our knowledge, have not been directly shown
previously (39). Our finding of direct antitumoral effects is important
as targeted therapy to both tumor and host provides a robust
platform upon which to develop novel therapeutics and strategies.
To assess the potential utility of AVE8062 alone and in
combination with docetaxel, we initially did efficacy experiments
in vivo with small volume orthotopic models of ovarian cancer.

Significant reductions in tumor weight were observed for each of
the treatment cohorts with the expected exception of single-agent
docetaxel in the HeyA8-MDR model. The importance of evaluating
the combination of AVE8062 and docetaxel in a drug-resistant
model is to parallel the frequently observed clinical challenge of
acquired resistance. In addition to established efficacy in vivo, we
observed remarkably enhanced antitumor effects with docetaxel in
this model, suggesting that the two agents would be a relevant
therapeutic choice in a mixed sensitivity population of tumor
present in bulky disease or generated by exposure to prior cytotoxic
therapy. This effect was indeed observed in our in vivo therapy
experiment in the bulky HeyA8 orthotopic tumor model. In these
experiments, docetaxel monotherapy was not effective and was
similar to the HeyA8-MDR model.
Describing the mechanisms for these encouraging therapeutic
outcomes is necessary to understand how the target tissues are
affected and to aid in strategic drug development. We approached
this facet from several angles to not only evaluate the effects of
therapy anatomically (excised tumors), but also metabolically
([18F]FDG PET imaging). Our longitudinal imaging protocols
mimicked the serial imaging that is done in the clinic to monitor
individual tumors in patients before and after therapy. Tozer et al.
(40) have previously shown rapid vascular shutdown after
treatment with CA-4P in a mouse model of carcinosarcoma. The
resultant increase in hematocrit, increased viscosity, and increased
interstitial pressure led to vascular occlusion followed by tumor
cell kill. In the current report, we extend these findings by
substantial and early effects on metabolic activity, as assessed by
[18F]FDG PET imaging. Therefore, it is possible that [18F]FDG PET
may be an early indicator of therapeutic response with AVE8062
and other vascular-targeting agents.
In addition to antivascular effects on endothelial cells, we
hypothesized that AVE8062 might have direct cytotoxic effects on
tumor cells. To evaluate this, we studied induced cell cycle effects

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (19). October 1, 2007

in vitro on ovarian cancer cells. AVE8062 arrested tumor cells in
G2-M and induced apoptosis. The correlation between time of
detectable mitotic arrest and apoptosis suggests that the latter
occurs after a relatively short period of mitotic shutdown. This
effect augmented the in vitro efficacy of docetaxel as documented
by the 2- to 4-fold reduction in IC50 for docetaxel in the presence of
AVE8062 in our cytotoxicity experiments. Enhanced efficacy with
the AVE8062 and docetaxel combination was observed in each of
our models, including the taxane-resistant HeyA8-MDR cell line.
The pronounced effect is felt to be primarily due to apoptosis after
mitotic arrest (41, 42).
Development of VDAs, as a new class of therapeutic agents, is
ongoing via early clinical investigation. Our observations support
the strategy of combining these agents with a cytotoxic agent.
Because at least additive effects are observed with taxanes, these
regimens are highly desirable in ovarian cancer management.
However, an early phase trial of CA-4-P and carboplatin
documented higher than expected hematologic toxicity, predominantly thrombocytopenia, highlighting the necessity to design
trials with careful pharmacokinetic studies to evaluate the
potential for drug-drug interactions (43). In the current study, we
identified a potential dose threshold for AVE8062 from which
additional dose escalation did not improve cytotoxicity. Because
MTD-based studies are usually defined by attendant toxicity in
dose escalation, consideration of optimal biological doses through
early in vivo imaging will be desirable. In addition, given the
observed effects on endothelium and tumor cells, investigation on
wound healing will be necessary to establish safety. Future
experiments to optimize therapeutic efficacy may include varying
dosing schedules such as temporally separating administration of
a second drug relative to administration of AVE8062. Nonetheless,
our documentation of augmented cytotoxicity even in a drugresistant model is an encouraging factor for future clinical
development.

AVE8062 in Ovarian Carcinoma

In summary, we have documented that AVE8062 inhibits ovarian
cancer growth through direct effects on endothelial cells causing
substantive disruption in tumor blood flow leading to central
necrosis in our orthotopic murine model. The effects are rapid
in onset and clearly seen by noninvasive PET imaging. We documented the effects on developing tumors and, perhaps more
importantly, in established tumors and among both taxanesensitive and taxane-resistant tumors. These data indicate that
AVE8062 in combination with chemotherapy may offer opportunities for novel therapeutic strategies in ovarian carcinoma.
