Abstract
DNA mismatch repair (MMR) ensures the fidelity of DNA
replication and is required for activation of cell cycle arrest
and apoptosis in response to certain classes of DNA damage.
We recently reported that MMR is also implicated in initiation of an autophagic response after MMR processing of
6-thioguanine (6-TG). It is now generally believed that autophagy is negatively controlled by mammalian target of
rapamycin (mTOR) activity. To determine whether mTOR is
involved in 6-TG–induced autophagy, we used rapamycin, a
potential anticancer agent, to inhibit mTOR activity. Surprisingly, we find that rapamycin cotreatment inhibits 6-TG–
induced autophagy in MMR-proficient human colorectal
cancer HCT116 (MLH1+) and HT29 cells as measured by LC3
immunoblotting, GFP-LC3 relocalization, and acridine orange
staining. Consistently, short interfering RNA silencing of
the 70-kDa ribosomal S6 kinase 1 (S6K1), the downstream
effector of mTOR, markedly reduces 6-TG–induced autophagy.
Furthermore, we show that inhibition of mTOR by rapamycin
induces the activation of Akt as shown by increased Akt
phosphorylation at Ser473 and the inhibition of 6-TG–induced
apoptosis and cell death. Activated Akt is a well-known
inhibitor of autophagy. In conclusion, our data indicate that
mTOR-S6K1 positively regulates autophagy after MMR processing of 6-TG probably through its negative feedback
inhibition of Akt. [Cancer Res 2008;68(7):2384–90]

Introduction
Macroautophagy (hereafter called autophagy) is an evolutionarily
conserved catabolic process where cytoplasmic contents and
organelles such as mitochondria are sequestered into a doublemembrane vesicle, called an autophagosome. The autophagosome
then fuses with a lysosome and releases the inner vesicle into the
lysosome, where degradative enzymes break the vesicle down (1, 2).
Degradation and recycling of the contents of the vesicle enable the cell
to continue to carry out essential processes for cell survival under
stress conditions (3, 4). However, excessive autophagy results in type II
programmed cell death (3). Autophagy not only functions as a tumor
suppressor mechanism (5, 6) but also has been observed as a novel
response to some anticancer DNA-damaging agents such as ionizing
radiation (7), temozolomide (8) and 6-thioguanine (6-TG; ref. 9).
DNA mismatch repair (MMR) system plays an essential role
in repairing mismatches caused by DNA polymerase errors and

reduces mutagenesis (10). MMR has also been shown to be essential
for mediating the antitumor effects of several classes of commonly
used chemotherapy agents such as N-methyl-N-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine, temozolomide, cisplatin, and 6-TG (10–12). These treatments
induce cells to undergo cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in a MMRdependent manner (10–12). In a recent report, we observed a novel
role of MMR in initiation of an autophagic response to 6-TG (9).
In this study, we use the purine analogue 6-TG as a model
compound to investigate the molecular machinery of autophagy
after MMR processing of chemotherapy drugs (9, 13). Our previous
report indicates that the cytotoxicity of 6-TG mainly results from
the futile attempt of MMR to repair 6-TG–induced DNA mismatch
damage (14). After intracellular processing and incorporation into
DNA, 6-TG is chemically converted to form S 6-methylthioguanine,
which introduces S 6-methylthioguanine–thymine mispairs during
subsequent DNA replication. S 6-methylthioguanine–thymine mispairs are then identified by MMR as replication errors (15). During
the futile repair cycle, MMR attempts to process S 6-methylthioguanine–thymine mismatches in the newly synthesized daughter
strands. Because some S 6-methylthioguanine is in the template
strand, which is not excised by MMR, abortive repair cycles result
in accumulating DNA strand breaks (14, 16). In other words,
6-TG–induced DNA damage is not fully MMR-repairable and the
accumulating DNA strand breaks will continuously activate the
autophagy pathway. Excessive autophagy may ultimately lead to
type II programmed cell death (3). Therefore, it is of potential
clinical importance to better understand the molecular mechanisms regulating the autophagic pathway after MMR processing of
chemotherapeutic drugs such as 6-TG.
Mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) is a phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase (PI3K)-related serine/threonine protein kinase that
regulates many aspects of cellular functions, including transcription, translation, cell size, cytoskeletal organization, and autophagy
(17, 18). mTOR exists in two distinct protein complexes, termed
TORC1 and TORC2. TORC1 is rapamycin-sensitive and consists of
mTOR, raptor, and mLST8 (GhL; refs. 18, 19). TORC2 is rapamycininsensitive and contains mTOR, rictor, and mLST8 (18, 19). TORC1
is primarily activated by the PI3K-Akt pathway (20, 21). After
binding to growth factors including insulin or insulin-like growth
factor (IGF)-I, insulin/IGF-I receptor tyrosine kinases (RTK)
undergo autophosphorylation and become activated, leading to
phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate (IRS) proteins on
several tyrosine residues with subsequent recruitment and
activation of PI3K. PI3K together with TORC2 fully activates Akt
(20, 21). PI3K-Akt activation is well-known to suppress autophagy
in mammalian cells (22–25). Akt further activates the downstream
rapamycin-sensitive TORC1 by inhibiting a protein complex
formed by the tumor suppressor proteins, termed tuberous
sclerosis complex. This complex acts as a key negative regulator
of TORC1 activity (17, 18). Activated mTOR is generally believed to
be involved in the negative control of mammalian autophagy,

mTOR-S6K1 Positively Regulates 6-TG–induced Authopagy

although the mTOR effectors that regulate autophagy have not
been clearly elucidated (26–28).
TORC1 activation by the PI3K-Akt pathway also results in
phosphorylation and activation of S6 kinase 1 (S6K1) and the
eukaryotic initiation factor 4E–binding protein 1, which regulates
protein synthesis (17, 18). Interestingly, S6K1 can, in turn, produce
feedback inhibition of PI3K-Akt through phosphorylating IRS-1
and, thus, disrupting its interaction with insulin/IGF-I RTKs and
destabilizing IRS-1 (29, 30).
In this study, we determine whether mTOR plays any role in
regulating autophagy after MMR processing of 6-TG. In contrast
with earlier reports (26–28), our results show that inhibition of
mTOR activity by rapamycin impairs 6-TG–induced autophagy. In
agreement, we find that short interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated
silencing of S6K1, one of the downstream effectors of mTOR,
attenuates 6-TG–induced autophagy. Furthermore, inhibition of
mTOR activity by rapamycin induces phosphorylation and
activation of Akt, a well-established inhibitor of autophagy
(22–25). Together, these data suggest that mTOR-S6K1 functions
in positively modulating 6-TG–induced mammalian autophagy
through negative feedback inhibition of PI3K-Akt.

Materials and Methods

Results

Cell culture. Human colorectal cancer (HCT116) cells with stable
transfection of human MLH1 cDNA were kindly provided by Dr. Francoise
Praz (Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique, Villejuif, France; ref. 31).
HCT116 cells are MMR-deficient (MMR ) because the hMLH1 gene in these
cells contains a base substitution that results in a termination signal at codon
252 (TCATAA; ref. 32). Stable expression of a cloned wild-type hMLH1 cDNA
has been shown to restore MMR activity (MMR+) in the HCT116 cells (31).
Human colorectal HT29 cell line, which is MMR proficient (14), was obtained
from the American Type Culture Collection. The cells were maintained in
DMEM (Mediatech, Inc.) and supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum
(Hyclone), penicillin (100Ag/mL), streptomycin (100 units/mL), L-glutamine
(2 mmol/L), and nonessential amino acids (0.1 mmol/L; Invitrogen).
Drug treatment. Cells were seeded at 30,000 cells per 60-mm dish and
allowed to attach and grow for 17 h. Three micromoles per liter of 6-TG
(Sigma) were then added to the medium. After 24 h, 6-TG was removed
and the cells were incubated in drug-free medium with or without 0.2 to
5 nmol/L rapamycin (EMD Chemicals, Inc.) for an additional 3 d to assess
the role of mTOR in response to 6-TG–induced autophagy. Rapamycin is
known to inhibit mTOR activity (27).
Stable transfection of green fluorescent protein–light chain 3 in
HCT116 cells. HCT116 (MLH1+, MMR+) cells with stable expression of
green fluorescent protein–light chain 3 (GFP-LC3) were generated as
described recently (9). Briefly, pGFP-LC3 plasmids (a generous gift of
Dr. Tamotsu Yoshimori, National Institute of Genetics, Shizuoka-ken, Japan;
ref. 33) were transfected into HCT116 (MLH1 cDNA transfected) cells using
FuGENE 6 (Roche), according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Forty eight
hours after the transfection, the cells were selected with 1 mg/mL G418 for
2 wk. GFP-LC3–expressing colonies were isolated and expanded.
siRNA-mediated silencing of S6K1. siRNA oligos were chemically
synthesized by Dharmacon, Inc. The siRNA sequence specific for luciferase
(5¶-CGUACGCGGAAUACUUCGAdTdT-3¶) was used as a control. The sense
siRNA sequence for knocking down S6K1 was 5¶-GGACAUGGCAGGAGUGUUU dTdT-3¶. siRNAs were transfected using Lipofectamine 2000
(Invitrogen), according to the manufacturer’s protocol.
Detection and quantification of acidic vesicular organelles with
acridine orange. Vital staining of cells with acridine orange (Invitrogen)
was performed essentially as described (7–9). Briefly, cells were grown in
100-mm dishes and treated with 6-TG or vehicle (NaOH), as described above.
Acridine orange was added for 15 min at a final concentration of 1 Ag/mL,
and unfixed cells were harvested by trypsinization and immediately analyzed
by flow cytometry (Epics XL-MCL; Beckman Coulter, Inc.).

Propidium iodide staining for apoptosis. Cells were fixed with 90%
ethanol at 20jC for 15 min, incubated with RNase, stained with propidium
iodide, and then subjected to flow cytometry (Epics XL-MCL; Beckman
Coulter, Inc.).
Immunoblotting. SDS-PAGE and immunoblot analyses were performed
as described previously (9). The primary antibodies used for immunoblot
analyses included a rabbit polyclonal antibody against LC3 (a generous gift
of Dr. Tamotsu Yoshimori, National Institute of Genetics, Shizuoka-ken,
Japan; ref. 33); a rabbit polyclonal antibody against cleaved poly(ADP)ribose
polymerase (PARP; Promega); rabbit monoclonal antibodies against S6K1,
phospho-Akt (Ser473), and Akt; a mouse monoclonal antibody against
phospho-S6K1 (Thr389; Cell Signaling Technology, Inc.); and mouse
monoclonal antibodies against h-Actin and a-Tubulin (Sigma).
Clonogenic survival assay. Cell survival after treatment with 6-TG was
determined by a standard colony-forming assay. Briefly, 200 to 4,000 cells
were plated into 60-mm dishes and allowed to adhere for 17 h. Cells were
then treated with 6-TG (1–6 Amol/L) for 24 h and subsequently incubated in
fresh medium with or without 5 nmol/L rapamycin for 14 d for colony
formation. The colonies were stained with 0.5% crystal violet in methanol/
acetic acid (3:1), and those with >50 cells were counted.
Statistics. Statistical analysis was performed using Student’s t test, and
a P value of <0.05 was considered significant. Data are expressed as the
mean F SE. The mean value was obtained from at least three independent
experiments.

Inhibition of mTOR by rapamycin impairs 6-TG–induced
autophagy. Our earlier studies have described that DNA MMR
initiates 6-TG–induced autophagy in human colorectal cancer
HCT116 (MLH1+, MMR+) cells (9, 13). Accumulating evidence
suggests that mTOR is a negative regulator of mammalian
autophagy (26–28). To better characterize how mTOR regulates
an autophagy pathway after MMR processing of chemotherapy
drugs such as 6-TG, we used rapamycin cotreatment to inhibit
mTOR activity. In this study, microtubule-associated protein LC3
immunoblotting was first applied to monitor autophagosome
biogenesis. LC3 exists in a cytosolic form (LC3-I) and a LC3-II form
that is conjugated to phosphatidylethanolamine (33). LC3-II is
present on isolation membranes, autophagosome membranes,
and much less on autolysosomes during the autophagic process.
The amount of LC3-II is closely correlated with the number of
autophagosomes and serves as a good indicator of autophagosome
formation (34). As shown by the immunoblots in Fig. 1A, rapamycin
reduces mTOR activity in a dose-dependent manner as measured
by the phosphorylation of S6K1 at Thr389, the active form of the
downstream effector protein of mTOR. In contrast to earlier reports
(26–28), the inhibition of mTOR activity by rapamycin impairs a
6-TG–induced increase in the amount of LC3-II in a dose-dependent
manner in HCT116 (MLH1+, MMR+) cells (Fig. 1A). Similar results
were obtained from another MMR-proficient human colorectal
cancer HT29 cells (Fig. 1B) as well as in MMR+ human endometrial
(HEC59) and prostate (PC3) cancer cell lines (data not shown).
Besides LC3 immunoblotting, another specific and reliable
method to monitor autophagy in mammalian cells is to visualize
the intracellular localization of GFP-tagged LC3 by fluorescence
microscopy (34). Before induction of autophagy, GFP-LC3 shows
diffuse localization in the cytosol; whereas when autophagy is
induced, GFP-LC3 will specifically relocalize to autophagic membranes and exhibit punctate dot cytoplasmic signals (34). Because
transient transfection of GFP-LC3 causes a high background of
punctate dot signals (35), we used HCT116 (MLH1+, MMR+) cells
with stable expression of GFP-LC3 to further confirm if inhibition
of mTOR by rapamycin attenuates 6-TG–induced autophagy as

described in Fig. 1A. Consistent with our previous report (9), f38%
of the cells (MLH1+, MMR+) show punctate dot signals after MMR
processing of 6-TG with little background in untreated cells.
In agreement with the above results from LC3 immunoblotting
(Fig. 1A and B), rapamycin cotreatment significantly reduces 6-TG–
induced GFP-LC3 relocalization from the cytosol to the autophagic
membranes (P = 0.00318, two-tailed t test; Fig. 1C and D).
It is well-documented that a substantial increase in the intensity
of bright red fluorescence emitted by acridine orange occurs in
conjunction with the induction of autophagy (7–9). Acridine
orange, a lysosomotropic agent, enters an acidic compartment as

unchanged molecules but become protonated and trapped in the
acidic compartments such as lysosomes in aggregates that
fluoresce bright red or orange. When bound to DNA and RNA,
acridine orange emits green fluorescence (36). It is thought that an
increased autophagic influx tends to stimulate lysosomal proton
pumping and increase lysosomal acidity, thereby establishing a
correlation between autophagic activity and overall lysosomal
acidity (37). The increased lysosomal acidity arising from induction
of autophagy can be reflected by the intensity of bright red
fluorescence emitted by acridine orange (37). Therefore, to further
support our findings as described in Fig. 1, we next performed flow

to 6-TG, cells were harvested and analyzed by immunoblot analysis with antibodies against LC3, S6K1, and phospho-S6K1 (Thr389). C, HCT116 (MLH1+, MMR+)

treatment (a, untreated; b, 6-TG only; c, 6-TG + rapamycin; d, rapamycin only). The percentage of GFP-LC3–positive cells with GFP-LC3 punctate dots was
then determined. A minimum of 250 cells per sample was counted from triplicate samples, and statistical analysis was performed using Student’s t test (D). *, rapamycin
cotreatment significantly inhibits a 6-TG–induced increase in the percentage of cells with GFP-LC3 dots (P = 0.00318, two-tailed t test).

MMR+) cells, compared with that in cells treated with vehicle
NaOH. In agreement with the findings as shown in Fig. 1,
rapamycin cotreatment significantly impairs the 6-TG–induced
increase in lysosomal acidity (P = 0.000226, two-tailed t test; Fig. 2).
Together, these findings (Figs. 1 and 2) show that inhibition of
mTOR by rapamycin suppresses induction of autophagy after MMR
processing of 6-TG in HCT116 (MLH1+, MMR+) and HT29 cells,
indicating that mTOR is a positive regulator of 6-TG–induced
autophagy.
Suppression of S6K1 expression disrupts 6-TG–induced
autophagy. It has been described that S6K1 is a critical
downstream substrate and effector of the mTOR signaling pathway
(17, 18). Next, we asked whether S6K1 is a downstream effector of
mTOR in modulating 6-TG–induced autophagy. To test this,
HCT116 (MLH1+, MMR+) cells were transiently transfected with
siRNA targeting S6K1 to specifically knock down this protein
expression. As shown in Fig. 3, S6K1 siRNA dramatically reduces
the total protein level of S6K1 and accordingly reduces S6K1
phosphorylation at Thr389 to an undetectable level compared with
control luciferase siRNA–transfected cells. As a result, siRNAmediated suppression of S6K1 expression reduces both basic and
6-TG–induced autophagy compared with that in control luciferase
siRNA–transfected cells.
Inhibition of mTOR-S6K1 increases Akt activity. The above
results show that inhibition of mTOR by rapamycin and S6K1
knockdown reduce 6-TG–induced autophagy. As discussed above,
extensive studies have established that a negative feedback loop

from mTOR-S6K1 to PI3K-Akt is present not only in Drosophila (38)
but also in mammalian cells (39). Furthermore, PI3K-Akt activation
is well-known to suppress autophagy in mammalian cells (22–25).
Next, we sought to determine if inhibition of mTOR-S6K1 by
rapamycin relieves the negative feedback and increases Akt
activity. As shown in Fig. 4., rapamycin cotreatment does not
affect total Akt protein levels. However, it dramatically increases
Akt phosphorylation at Ser473 in a dose-dependent manner,
indicating that mTOR-S6K1 exerts a strong negative feedback on
Akt, an autophagy inhibitor, in HCT116 (MLH1+, MMR+) cells.
Inhibition of mTOR-S6K1 suppresses 6-TG–induced apoptosis.
PI3K-Akt mediates a variety of biological functions, including
glucose uptake, protein synthesis, and inhibition of cell death (40).
Once activated, PI3K-Akt can promote cell survival by inhibiting type
I (apoptosis) and type II (autophagy) programmed cell death (40).
Thus, to show that phosphorylation and activation of Akt induced by
rapamycin is functional, we measured 6-TG–induced apoptosis after
rapamycin cotreatment. Consistent with the finding of rapamycininduced Akt activation (Fig. 4), mTOR-S6K inhibition by rapamycin
significantly attenuates a 6-TG–induced subG1 compartment, a good
indicator of apoptosis (Fig. 5A). In agreement, rapamycin also
inhibits 6-TG–induced PARP cleavage, a marker of apoptosis, in a
dose-dependent manner (Fig. 5B). These data indicate that
activation of Akt by rapamycin blocks 6-TG–induced apoptosis.
Inhibition of mTOR-S6K1 reduces 6-TG–induced cell death.
To further establish that Akt phosphorylation and activation
induced by rapamycin has biological function, we measured
clonogenic cell survival. Consistent with the findings of inhibition
of autophagy (Figs. 1–3) and apoptosis (Fig. 5A and B), rapamycin
cotreatment significantly reduces 6-TG–induced cell death
(P < 0.05, two-tailed t test; Fig. 5C), indicating that inhibition of
mTOR by rapamycin relieves the negative feedback, which activates
Akt activity and promotes cell survival after exposure to 6-TG.

Discussion
mTOR has been thought to be a negative regulator of autophagy
in mammalian cells (26–28). In contrast, we show that mTOR
positively modulates 6-TG–induced autophagy in human colorectal
cancer HCT116 (MLH1+, MMR+) and HT29 cells. Using rapamycin,
a chemical mTOR inhibitor, we found that rapamycin attenuates
6-TG–induced autophagy. siRNA-mediated silencing of S6K1
expression further reveals that S6K1 is the downstream effector
protein of mTOR in modulating 6-TG–induced autophagy. Our
results also indicate that mTOR-S6K1 positively regulates autophagy through negative feedback inhibition of Akt, a well-known
inhibitor of mammalian autophagy (22–25). These studies expand
our understanding of the roles of mTOR in regulating mammalian
autophagy and provide important information on the molecular
machinery of autophagy after MMR processes DNA damage from
certain types of chemotherapy drugs.
Extensive reports have described that mTOR is a negative
regulator of mammalian autophagy (26–28). However, some recent
studies have described that autophagy can also be induced in a
mTOR-independent manner by lithium, inositol monophosphatase
inhibitors (41), and trehalose (42). Our data show that mTOR
inhibition by rapamycin and siRNA-mediated silencing of S6K1
expression reduces 6-TG–induced autophagy in human colorectal
cancer HCT116 (MLH1+) cells, indicating that mTOR-S6K1 is
needed for induction of autophagy (Figs. 1–3). Our results also
show that rapamycin cotreatment reduces 6-TG–induced auto-

phagy (as measured by reduced LC3-II protein level) in another
MMR+ human colorectal cancer (HT29) cell line (Fig. 1B) as well as
in MMR+ human endometrial (HEC59) and prostate (PC3) cancer
cell lines (data not shown). These discrepant reports indicate that
the cellular effects of mTOR on autophagy may depend on cell type,
cellular context, and nature of the treatment.
Our results further show that inhibition of mTOR-S6K1 by
rapamycin induces Akt activation as shown by Akt phosphorylation at Ser473, inhibition of apoptosis, and promotion of cell
survival after 6-TG treatment (Figs. 4 and 5). These data imply that
one of the key factors determining how mTOR-S6K1 regulates
autophagy could be whether the cell line possesses a sensitive
negative feedback inhibition of PI3K-Akt by mTOR-S6K1. The
negative feedback inhibition of PI3K-Akt by mTOR-S6K1 has been
found in Drosophila (38), some normal mammalian cells (39), and
some human cancer cell lines (43). Although the exact mechanism
remains to be defined, activation of PI3K-Akt has been reported to
suppress autophagy (22–25). Like the molecular mechanism for
how Akt activity inhibits apoptosis (17, 18), Akt activation induced
by rapamycin can block induction of autophagy through phosphorylating and inactivating its substrates such as Foxo, which has
recently been found to be involved in autophagy in Drosophila (44).
It will be very interesting to further investigate this possibility.
An earlier report has described that S6K is required for
starvation-induced autophagy in the Drosophila fat body (45).
Consistent with this finding, we observed an essential role for S6K1
in 6-TG–induced autophagy in human colorectal cancer HCT116
cells (Fig. 3). Although the mechanism is still not well-defined,
activated S6K1 by mTOR has been described to participate in
protein synthesis (17, 18). Therefore, besides the effect on the
negative feedback inhibition of PI3K-Akt as described above, S6K1
may also control 6-TG–induced autophagy through translation of
some proteins essential for induction of autophagy.
Rapamycin and several analogues, such as CCI-779 and RAD1,
are currently undergoing clinical evaluation as anticancer agents
(46). The complex of rapamycin with its intracellular receptor
FKBP12 binds directly to mTORC1 and then inhibits mTORC1mediated phosphorylation of the substrates S6K1 and 4EBP1. The
intrinsic sensitivity to rapamycin among different cancer cell

cleaved PARP. C, cells were treated with 1 to 6 Amol/L 6-TG for 24 h. Five nanomoles per liter of rapamycin were then added to inhibit mTOR activity. At day 14
after exposure to 6-TG, surviving colonies were stained with 0.5% crystal violet and colonies with >50 cells were counted (closed circles, 6-TG treated only;
open circles, 6-TG + 5 nmol/L rapamycin). *, rapamycin cotreatment significantly reduces 6-TG–induced cell death (P < 0.05, two-tailed t test).

lines may vary by several orders of magnitude ranging from 1 to
5,000 nmol/L (46), indicating that some cancer cell lines are
actually resistant to rapamycin. In this study, we find that
rapamycin antagonizes the anticancer effect of 6-TG in HCT116
colorectal cancer cells (Fig. 5C), probably through inhibiting
6-TG–induced apoptosis and excessive autophagy. These results
suggest that caution should be used if future combination therapy
with rapamycin and 6-TG or other chemotherapy drugs processed
by MMR are used clinically, as modulation of the mTOR pathway
by rapamycin could lead to reducing tumor cell death as opposed
to enhancing tumor cell killing.
As described earlier, MMR is required for the cytotoxicity of
many clinically important anticancer agents, including methylating
agents such as temozolomide; platinum compounds such as
cisplatin and carboplatin; and antimetabolites such as 6-TG,
5-fluorouracil, and 6-mercaptopurine (10–12). Our results indicate
that PI3K-Akt activation induced by rapamycin attenuates the

antitumor effect of 6-TG in the HCT116 human colorectal cancer
cell line probably through inhibiting induction of apoptosis and
autophagy. Consequently, targeted inhibition of PI3K-Akt might
potentially promote the antitumor efficacy of 6-TG or other MMR
processed chemotherapy drugs in some human cancers.
In summary, we show that mTOR inhibition by rapamycin and
siRNA-mediated silencing of S6K1 expression attenuates 6-TG–
induced autophagy, and mTOR-S6K1 probably modulates 6-TG–
induced autophagy through exerting a negative feedback inhibition
of PI3K-Akt.
