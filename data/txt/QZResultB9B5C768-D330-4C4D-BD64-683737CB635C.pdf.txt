Abstract
One third of the patients with estrogen receptor a (ERa)positive breast cancer who are treated with the antiestrogen
tamoxifen will either not respond to initial therapy or will
develop drug resistance. Endocrine response involves crosstalk
between ERa and TGFb signaling, such that tamoxifen nonresponsiveness or resistance in breast cancer might involve
aberrant TGFb signaling. In this study, we analyzed TGFb
receptor type 2 (TGFBR2) expression and correlated it with
ERa status and phosphorylation in a cohort of 564 patients
who had been randomized to tamoxifen or no-adjuvant treatment for invasive breast carcinoma. We also evaluated an
additional four independent genetic datasets in invasive breast
cancer. In all the cohorts we analyzed, we documented an
association of low TGFBR2 protein and mRNA expression with

tamoxifen resistance. Functional investigations conﬁrmed that
cell cycle or apoptosis responses to estrogen or tamoxifen in
ERa-positive breast cancer cells were impaired by TGFBR2
silencing, as was ERa phosphorylation, tamoxifen-induced
transcriptional activation of TGFb, and upregulation of the
multidrug resistance protein ABCG2. Acquisition of low
TGFBR2 expression as a contributing factor to endocrine resistance was validated prospectively in a tamoxifen-resistant cell
line generated by long-term drug treatment. Collectively, our
results established a central contribution of TGFb signaling in
endocrine resistance in breast cancer and offered evidence that
TGFBR2 can serve as an independent biomarker to predict
treatment outcomes in ERa-positive forms of this disease.

Introduction

resistance and the identiﬁcation of new therapeutic targets have
therefore become increasingly relevant (1–3).
TGFb is a pleiotropic cytokine with potent antimitogenic and
proapoptotic effects (4). Because of its dual role, TGFb is also a
known regulator of cell differentiation, motility, and invasion
(5–9). Consequently in cancer, cellular functions mediated by
TGFb are complex, as blockade and induction of TGFb signaling in mouse models has been associated with tumor progression (10–12).
TGFb receptor type 2 (TGFBR2) is the sole ligand-binding
receptor for members of the TGFb family comprising TGFb1,
-2, and -3. Ligand-induced cell response is mediated through
either canonical, SMAD-dependent, or other noncanonical,
SMAD-independent signaling pathways such as through JNK,
Akt, Src, p42/44 (ERK1/2), and p38 MAPK (13).
High TGFBR2 expression is a poor prognostic indicator for
overall survival in ERa-negative breast cancer (14). A TGFb
response signature using human epithelial cell lines was linked
to lung metastases in ERa-negative breast cancer, whereas there
was no correlation with distant metastases for ERa-positive breast
cancer (15). Thus, cells may escape the antitumorigenic effects of
TGFb depending on the ERa status.
ERa and TGFb pathways intersect at multiple cross-points
including direct protein–protein interactions. ERa blocks TGFb
signaling in a nongenomic manner by promoting SMAD2/3
degradation (16) and activation of MAPK through GPR30
(17). Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that SMAD3 and
SMAD4 act as coactivators and corepressors, respectively, for ERainduced gene expression (18, 19). Antiestrogen–induced growth
inhibition in breast cancer cells was shown to be mediated

The anti-estrogen tamoxifen is the most widely used adjuvant
endocrine therapy for patients with estrogen receptor a (ERa)positive breast cancer. However, one third of tamoxifen-treated
patients will have a disease recurrence within 15 years as they
do not respond to initial therapy or acquire drug resistance.
Deregulation of estrogen signaling is thought to be a common
mechanism for endocrine resistance. The activation of escape
pathways provides tumor cells with alternative proliferative or
survival stimuli including alterations in ERa itself, ERa coregulatory proteins, cell-cycle regulators, receptor tyrosine kinase
signaling, cell survival, or apoptosis. The discovery of new
biomarkers that classify patient subgroups with potential drug

through sequential activation of p38 MAPK and TGFb pathway
(20). Stromal TGFb1 expression stimulated by tamoxifen has
been reported to contribute to the growth-inhibitory effects of
endocrine treatment (21). However, the crosstalk between ERa
and TGFb pathways in breast cancer is still relatively poorly
understood and its elucidation may improve our knowledge of
the acquisition of resistance mechanisms.
In this study, we demonstrate for the ﬁrst time that loss of
TGFBR2 expression is a predictor for tamoxifen resistance in ERapositive breast cancer. Experimentally, we show that ERa-positive
breast cancer cell lines with shRNA-induced TGFBR2-speciﬁc
knockdown display altered cell signaling and an impaired
response upon estrogen and tamoxifen treatment. In addition,
TGFBR2 knockdown abrogates tamoxifen-induced ERa phosphorylation and TGFb transcriptional activity and results in
elevated levels of multidrug resistance protein ATP-binding cassette subfamily G member 2 (ABCG2). In line, analysis of a wellestablished long-term treated, tamoxifen-resistant cell line
revealed decreased TGFBR2 expression and deregulated TGFb
transcriptional activation further highlighting the role of TGFb
signaling in endocrine response.

Patients and Methods
Patient and tumor samples
Invasive breast cancer cohort includes 564 premenopausal
patients enrolled in a trial from 1986 to 1991 (SBII:2) and
randomized to either 2 years of adjuvant tamoxifen treatment
(n ¼ 276) or no systemic treatment (n ¼ 288). All patients were
followed up for recurrence-free survival. Recurrence (events) was
deﬁned as local, regional, or distant recurrence and breast cancer–
speciﬁc death, whereas contralateral breast cancer was excluded.
Each patient underwent surgery (either modiﬁed radical mastectomy or breast conserving surgery) followed by radiotherapy and
in a small number of cases adjuvant polychemotherapy (less than
2%). The median postsurgery follow-up time without a breast
cancer event was 13.9 years. Study was approved by Lund and
Link€
oping ethical committee and informed consent was obtained
from all patients participating. Further details of the trial have
been previously described (22, 23).
Representative tumor areas of formalin-ﬁxed and parafﬁnembedded tissue material were selected for tissue microarray
(TMA) construction. Details regarding TMA assembling and staining procedure validity of used antibodies have been reported (23).
TMA stained for TGFBR2 (Abcam) and phosphorylated SMAD2
(pSMAD2; Cell Signaling Technology) as previously described
have been used for this study analyzing the tumor compartment
(24). Scoring of tumor samples was performed under supervision
of a pathologist (G. Landberg) without knowledge of pathologic
and clinical data. The scoring accounts for intensity of immunostain-positive tumor cells. None of the examined tumor samples
displayed complete absence of TGFBR2 staining. Staining intensities of tumor cells were grouped into four categories ranging
from weak (score 0), weakly intermediate (score 1), intermediate
(score 2) to strong (score 3).
Gene expression data
Gene expression datasets for tamoxifen-treated patients were
downloaded from NCBI GEO as previously described (25). The
X-Tile software program (26) was used to determine the opti-

mal cut-off point. Kaplan Meier plots were generated and log
rank statistics were calculated using the survival package in R.
Cell culture
HEK293T, MCF7, and T47D were cultured in DMEM þ 10%
FBS in a humid chamber with 5% CO2 at 37 C. For estrogen
response studies, breast cancer cells were hormone-starved in
phenol red–free media supplemented with 5% charcoal-stripped
serum (CSS) for 24 hours followed by a 24-hour culture in 1%
CSS-DMEM before stimulation with either 17-b-estradiol (E2;
Sigma), 4-hydroxy-tamoxifen (4OHT; Sigma), fulvestrant (Sigma), recombinant human TGFb1 (rhTGFb1; R&D Systems),
TGFBR1 inhibitor SB431542 (Sigma), or a combination thereof
in 1% CSS media. For CSS preparation, 1% (w/v) dextran-coated
charcoal (Sigma) was added to FBS and heated to 55 C for 30
minutes in water bath. Suspension was centrifuged at 2,000  g
for 15 minutes before sterilizing it using a 0.22 mm ﬁlter. Origin of
all used cell lines has been conﬁrmed through institutional
authentication process, performed by Molecular Biology Core
Facility using a multiplex PCR assay (Applied Biosystems Ampflstr
system).
MCF7-derivative, tamoxifen-resistant cell line (TAM-R) was a
kind gift of Robert B. Clarke (University of Manchester, Manchester, United Kingdom). Generation of TAM-R has been described
previously (27). In brief, MCF7 has been cultured in phenol red–
free RPMI þ 5% CSS þ 0.1 mmol/L 4OHT over 6 months to obtain
TAM-R. For this study, TAM-R were cultured in phenol red–free
DMEM þ 5% CSS þ 0.1 mmol/L 4OHT. For epigenetic studies,
cells were treated with 0.5 mmol/L 5-Aza-20 -deoxycytidine (Sigma) or 0.1 mmol/L Trichostatin A (Sigma) using DMSO as vehicle
control.
Lentiviral knockdown
Transfections of breast cancer cells, MCF7 and T47D, were
performed using lentiviral approach as described by Weinberg
laboratory (28). Plasmids were a kind gift of Dr. Akira Orimo;
pCMV-VSV-G (Addgene: Plasmid 8454), pCMV-dR8.2dpvr
(Addgene: Plasmid 8455), pLKO.1-shRNA-hygro (Addgene: Plasmid 24150), GFP-shRNA (50 -GCAAGCTGACCCTGAAGTTCA30 ), TGFBR2-shRNA.1 (50 -GATTCAAGAGTATTCTCACTT-30 ), and
TGFBR2-shRNA.2 (50 -GAATGACGAGAACATAACACT-30 ). Briefly, HEK293T cells were transfected with lentiviral plasmid system
using Fugene 6 (Roche/Promega) over night. Next day, medium
was replaced and after 24 hours of virus production, supernatant
was collected, ﬁltered, and supplemented with 5 mg/mL protamine sulfate (Sigma) before infection of target cells overnight.
Media was replaced and 24 hours later, breast cancer cells were
selected in 200 mg/mL Hygromycin (Clontech) containing media.
Plasmid pCMV6-XL5 (Origene) containing TGFBR2 cDNA
(accession number NM_001024847) was used for transient,
constitutive overexpression of TGFBR2. Control "empty" vector
was obtained through NotI digestion to remove TGFBR2-encoding cDNA. Transfected cells were analyzed for RNA expression 24
hours after transfection or subjected to immunohistochemical
staining 48 hours after transfection.
Knockdown and overexpression of TGFBR2 was conﬁrmed by
quantitative PCR and immunohistochemical staining with
TGFBR2-speciﬁc antibody (Abcam, 1:50 dilution) of formalinﬁxed and parafﬁn-embedded cytospins. Transfected cells were
further analyzed for RNA and protein expression, protein

CSS for 96 hours (MCF7) or 8 days (T47D). In case of T47D,
media were replaced after 96 hours.

Quantitative PCR
Following lentiviral transfection, a fraction of cells was
pelleted and subjected to RNA isolation (Qiagen). RNA was
transcribed using TaqMan Reverse Transcriptase Kit (Applied
Biosystems) and resulting cDNA was used for real-time quantitative PCR (Applied Biosystems 7900) using Sybr green (Bioline) and TGFBR2-speciﬁc primers (forward: 50 -ACGTGTTGAGAGATCGAGG-30 ; reverse: 50 -CCCAGCACTCAGTCAACGTC30 ) and GAPDH-speciﬁc primers [forward: GGTCGGAGTCAACGGATTT-30 ; reverse 50 -TGATGGCAACAATATCCACTT-30 ;
primer sequences have previously been described (29)].

Cell-cycle analysis
For determination of DNA proﬁle, 4  105 cells per well were
seeded into 6-well plate. Cells were hormone-starved for 24 hours
in 5% CSS before 24-hour treatment in 1% CSS. After treatment,
cells were harvested with phenol red–free trypsin solution and
subsequently neutralized with phenol red–free 10% CSS media
and centrifuged at 1,800 rpm at 4 C for 5 minutes. Supernatant
was removed and cells resuspended in 1 mL ice-cold 70% ethanol
and put in freezer for at least 20 minutes. Afterwards, 5 mL PBS
were added to cells before centrifugation at 2,000 rpm at 4 C for
5 minutes. Supernatant was removed and 800 mL of Vindel€
ov
solution (3.5 mmol/L Tris-base pH 7.6, 10 mmol/L NaCl, 0.1%
Nonidet P40, 20 ng/mL RNase and 0.005% propidium iodide)
was added. Cells were incubated on ice for 20 minutes before ﬂow
cytometry analysis (FACS Calibur BD).

Western blot analysis
After treatment, MCF7 were scraped off in cell lysis buffer (25
mmol/L HEPES, 5 mmol/L EDTA, 30 mmol/L NaPP, 50 mmol/L
NaCl, 50 mmol/L NaF, 1% Triton-X, 10% glycerol, pH 7.4)
supplemented with protease and phosphatase inhibitor cocktail
(Roche). Cells were spun down and lysate collected and protein
concentration was determined using BCA assay (Pierce). Samples
were denatured in Laemmli buffer (250 mmol/L Tris-HCl pH 6.8,
40% glycerol, 8% SDS. 0.01% bromphenol blue, 20% b-mercaptoethanol) and run on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane (Amersham). Membranes
were blocked with either 5% BSA or 5% milk in TBS-T buffer.
Membranes were incubated with primary antibodies in 1:1,000
dilution in 3% BSA TBS-T supplemented with 2% blocking
reagent (Roche): rabbit anti-phospho-SMAD2 (Cell Signaling
Technology), mouse anti-SMAD2/3 (BD Biosciences), mouse
anti-phospho (Serine-118) ERa (Cell Signaling Technology),
rabbit anti-ERa (Thermo Fisher), mouse anti-Cyclin D1 (Dako),
rabbit anti-phospho-ERK1/2 (phospho-p44/42 MAPK; Cell Signaling Technology), rabbit anti-ERK1/2 (p44/42 MAPK; Cell
Signaling Technology), rabbit anti-ABCG2 (Cell Signaling Technology), rabbit anti-tubulin (Cell Signaling Technology) and
incubated with secondary horseradish peroxidase-linked antibody in 1:5,000 dilution: sheep anti-mouse (GE Healthcare),
goat anti-rabbit (Dako). Chemiluminescence was detected using
Luminata Forte (Millipore) on X-ray ﬁlms (Amersham).
Viability assay
Cell number was determined using Alamar blue (Invitrogen).
Therefore, 20 mL of 20% Alamar blue solution were added per well
of 96-well plates and after 1 hour incubation ﬂuorescence was
read (excitation: 544 nm, emission: 590 nm; BMG Omega Fluostar). For growth curve analysis, 1,000 cells per well were seeded in
96-well plates in 10% FBS-containing media. Viability was measured next day as reference point, media were replaced and for the
following 5 days viability was assessed every 24 hours. For TGFb
inhibition, 10 mmol/L SB431542 was added to the media (DMSO
as vehicle control). For estrogen withdrawal analysis, cells were
hormone-starved for 24 hours in 5% CSS before culture in 1%
CSS. For estrogen and tamoxifen/fulvestrant response studies,
5,000 cells per well were seeded in 96-well plates, hormonestarved for 24 hours in 5% CSS before incubation with different
concentrations of E2 (0.1–10 nmol/L) or 1 nmol/L E2 with
increasing concentrations of 4OHT or fulvestrant (1 nmol/L up
to 10 mmol/L) in absence or presence of 1 ng/mL rhTGFb1 in 1%

Apoptosis assay
Assessment of cell death was performed using Annexin
V-FITC Apoptosis Detection Kit (Abcam). Therefore, 4  105
cells per well were seeded into 6-well plate. Cells were hormone-starved for 24 hours in 5% CSS before 24 hours treatment in 1% CSS. After treatment, cells were harvested with
phenol red–free trypsin solution and subsequently neutralized
with phenol red–free 10% CSS media and centrifuged at 1,800
rpm for 5 minutes (including cells from culture media). Supernatant was removed and cells were washed once in PBS. Cells
were resuspended in 0.5 mL binding buffer containing 5 mL of
Annexin V-FITC conjugated antibody and 5 mL propidium
iodide solution for 5 minutes at room temperature before ﬂow
cytometry analysis (FACS Calibur BD).
Reporter assay
A total of 4  105 cells per well were seeded into 6-well plate.
Following day, cells were cotransfected with 1 mg p(CAGA)12MLP-Luc vector (kind gift of Nullin Divecha, University of Southampton, Southampton, United Kingdom) or 1 mg pGL4.27-ERE
(3)-GLuc (Gaussia luciferase; kind gift of Robert B. Clarke)
and 0.1 mg pCMV-RL-TK (Renilla luciferase; kind gift of Robert
B. Clarke) using X-treme HP DNA transfectant reagent (Roche).
Transfection was performed according to manufacturers' instructions. Next day, cells were trypsinized and 2  104 cells per well
reseeded into 96-well plate. Cells were cultured for 24 hours in 5%
CSS DMEM before 24-hour treatment in 1% CSS DMEM. Luciferase activity was measured using Dual-Glo Luciferase Assay
System (Promega) according to manual. Luminescence was
detected with microplate reader (BMG Omega Fluostar).
Immunoﬂuorescence
Lentivirally transfected MCF7 cells were seeded in 4-chamber
slides (4,000/well). Cells were cultured for 24 hours in 5% CSS
DMEM followed by 24-hour culture in 1% CSS DMEM. Cells were
treated in 1% CSS DMEM for 24 hours for Ki-67 staining and 96
hours for cleaved PARP staining. After treatment, cells were ﬁxed
with 4% formalin. Following PBS washing, cells were permeabilized with 0.25% Triton-X100 and blocked with 1% BSA, then
washed again before incubation with primary antibodies in 1:100
dilution overnight at 4 C: mouse anti-Ki-67 (Dako) and rabbit

anti-cleaved PARP (Cell Signaling Technology). Cells were
washed again and then incubated with secondary antibody in
1:500 dilution for 1 hour at room temperature or at 4 C overnight:
goat anti-mouse AlexaFluor555 (Invitrogen), goat anti-rabbit
AlexaFluor555 (Invitrogen). After further washing, cells were
mounted with DAPI-containing media (Sigma) and ﬂuorescence
was monitored with an inverted light microscope (Olympus
CKX41) using the EXFO X-Cite illumination system and SPOT
Imaging Solutions Microscopy Software.
Custom transcript array
Customized RT2 Proﬁler PCR Array (SABiosciences) was
employed to analyze mRNA expression levels in lentivirally
transfected cells in the presence of 1 nmol/L E2 with or without
0.1 mmol/L 4OHT. A total of 3  105 cells were seeded in a 6-cm
dish, next day media were changed to 5% CSS phenol red–free
DMEM. Following day, media were changed to 1% CSS phenol
red–free DMEM. Cells were treated for 24 hours in 1% CSS phenol
red–free DMEM before cell lysis and RNA extraction using RNeasy
Mini Kit (Qiagen). Four hundred nanograms of RNA was subjected to cDNA synthesis using RT2 First Strand Kit (SABiosciences) before PCR run using RT2 SYBR Green qPCR Mastermix
(SABiosciences). PCR reactions and cycling conditions were set up
according to manufacturer's instructions. PCR was run using a
real-time PCR thermal cycler (Applied Biosystems 7900). Analysis
was performed using SABiosciences' web-based RT2 Proﬁler PCR
array data analysis tool (version 3.5).
Statistical analyses
Spearman's rank order correlation coefﬁcient, Kruskal–
Wallis and Mann–Whitney U test were performed for evaluation of clinicopathologic and molecular parameters. The
Kaplan–Meier method was used to estimate recurrencefree survival and univariate Cox regression was used to compare
recurrence-free survival between different treatment groups or
according to marker categories. Cox proportional hazards
regression was used for relative risk estimation in multivariate
analysis. Covariates used for Cox regression included tumor
grade, tumor size, lymph node status, age, Ki-67, ERa status,
and treatment interaction. All P values corresponded to twosided tests and P values less than 0.05 were considered statistically signiﬁcant. Experimental data are represented as mean
of three to six independent experiments (unless otherwise
speciﬁed) and error bars indicate SEM and statistical difference
was assessed using two-sided Student t test.

Results
Low TGFBR2 expression is associated with tamoxifen resistance
in invasive breast carcinoma
To delineate the clinical value of the TGFb pathway in breast
cancer, we assessed the level of TGFBR2 expression and SMAD2
phosphorylation (pSMAD2) by immunohistochemical staining
of archived tissue sections of primary tumors using a cohort of
564 premenopausal patients enrolled in a randomized tamoxifen
trial (SBII:2), for study design see Supplementary Fig. S1.
Representative images of each staining category in regard to
TGFBR2 expression levels are depicted in Fig. 1A. Statistical
analyses to assess correlations to clinicopathologic markers
revealed that TGFBR2 is signiﬁcantly linked to ERa and PR status

1460 Cancer Res; 75(7) April 1, 2015

(Mann–Whitney U test; P < 0.001; Table 1). Prognostic recurrence-free survival analysis showed no difference between
patients with low or high TGFBR2 expression in the untreated
control group (Fig. 1B; Supplementary Table S1). However,
stratifying ERa-positive patients according to treatment revealed
a signiﬁcantly shortened recurrence-free survival for tamoxifentreated patients with low TGFBR2 expression (Univariate Cox
regression; HR: 0.312, 95% CI, 0.131–0.742; P ¼ 0.008; Fig. 1C).
A multivariate interaction analysis validated TGFBR2 as a treatment-predictive biomarker independent of known prognostic
markers (Multivariate Cox regression, HR, 0.267; 95% CI,
0.098–0.731; P ¼ 0.010; Table 2).
Our group previously reported that ERa phosphorylation at
serine-118 (pS118-ERa) is a predictor for tamoxifen sensitivity
(30) and ERK1/2 phosphorylation (pERK) as a marker for
tamoxifen resistance (31). We found that TGFBR2 expression
was signiﬁcantly correlated to pS118-ERa (Spearman, P <
0.001), but not to pERK (Table 1). S118-ERa phosphorylation
has been associated with ERa transactivation in numerous
studies (32–34) and we noted that cyclin D1, an ERa target
gene, was also signiﬁcantly linked to TGFBR2 (Spearman, P <
0.001; Table 1).
Analyzing four independent publically available gene expression datasets of tamoxifen-treated breast cancer, we noted significantly worse recurrence-free survival in all patient groups with
low TGFBR2 expression (log rank, P < 0.050; Fig. 1D) supporting
our ﬁndings.
To unravel the clinical relevance of canonical TGFb signaling in
tamoxifen resistance, we examined pSMAD2 in accordance to the
TGFBR2 study. Images representing each pSMAD2 staining category are shown in Supplementary Fig. S2A. In contrast to
TGFBR2, pSMAD2 was not associated with ERa and PR status
(Supplementary Table S2) or tamoxifen resistance (Supplementary Fig. S2B) but had prognostic qualities (Supplementary Fig.
S2C), which was signiﬁcant in multivariate Cox regression analysis (HR: 2.663; 95% CI, 1.201–5.906; P ¼ 0.016; Supplementary
Table S3). Therefore, TGFBR2 and pSMAD2 as biomarkers may
possess distinctive clinical signiﬁcance.
Targeting TGFb pathway in vitro
To further investigate the role of TGFBR2 in tamoxifen response
in ERa-positive breast cancer cell lines, we utilized two independent TGFBR2-speciﬁc shRNA constructs (TGFBR2-shRNA.1 and
-shRNA.2) and a pharmacologic inhibitor (SB431542).
Knockdown efﬁciency was conﬁrmed by quantitative PCR
with about 75% to 80% decrease in TGFBR2 mRNA expression
in MCF7 and about 40% to 50% reduction in T47D (Fig. 2A).
TGFBR2 knockdown in MCF7 was conﬁrmed on protein level
using immunohistochemical staining (Fig. 2B). Recombinant
human TGFb1 (rhTGFb1) reduced cell growth, an effect that
was diminished in the TGFBR2 knockdown cells (Supplementary Fig. S3A) signifying loss of responsiveness to TGFb.
Although displaying reduced viability in conventional cell
culture media (Supplementary Fig. S3B), hormone withdrawal
experiments revealed that TGFBR2 knockdown cells grow at a
higher rate (Supplementary Fig. S3C) through increased proliferation (cells in S-phase; Fig. 2C) and a lower overall cell
death (apoptotic and necrotic cells; Fig. 2D), although the latter
was not signiﬁcant.
The chemical compound SB431542 is a potent and selective
inhibitor of TGFb receptor type-1 (TGFBR1) and acts as a

competitive ATP-binding site kinase inhibitor preventing phosphorylation of the downstream targets, SMAD2 and SMAD3
(35). Phosphorylation of SMAD2 (pSMAD2) indicates stimulation of the canonical TGFb pathway and is therefore a useful
readout to monitor activation of TGFb signaling. In MCF7,
rhTGFb–induced SMAD2 phosphorylation was completely abolished by SB431542 for all treatments (Supplementary Fig. S4A).
TGFBR2 knockdown attenuates estrogen-induced proliferation
Concentration-dependent, estrogen-induced increase in cell
viability was reduced in TGFBR2 knockdown cells (Fig. 2E).
The differential estrogen response was even more pronounced
in the presence of rhTGFb1 (Fig. 2E, right). Flow cytometric cellcycle analysis revealed a 5-fold increase in the number of cells
in S-phase upon estrogen treatment, which was signiﬁcantly
attenuated in TGFBR2 knockdown cells exhibiting a 2-fold

increase (Fig. 2F), whereas estrogen-mediated effect on apoptosis was unaffected (Fig. 2G).
Similar observations in regard to estrogen sensitivity using a
TGFBR1 inhibitor (Supplementary Fig. S4B) suggest that manipulation of the TGFb pathway alters estrogen response, indicative
of a TGFb-ERa signaling crosstalk.
Transcriptional activity of ERa and TGFb pathway are monitored using ERE-dependent and SMAD-dependent (CAGA
promoter) luciferase-expressing plasmids, respectively (Supplementary Fig. S5A and S5B). Strikingly, basal ERa transcriptional
activity was elevated in TGFBR2 knockdown cells (Supplementary Fig. S5C), hinting that lack of TGFBR2 results in a loss
of TGFb-mediated ERa inhibition, which may explain the
observed increased proliferation in hormone deprivation conditions. Estrogen-induced classical ERa transcriptional activity,
however, was unchanged (Supplementary Fig. S5D).

Fig. 3A). Similarly, TGFBR2 knockdown in T47D cells (Fig. 3B)
and using a TGFb inhibitor (Supplementary Fig. S4C) impaired
the tamoxifen response.
Treatment of TGFBR2 knockdown cells with the pure antiestrogen fulvestrant also resulted in an altered drug response (Supplementary Fig. S6), suggesting that lack of TGFBR2 results in an
overall desensitization to endocrine treatment.
Cell-cycle distribution (Fig. 3C) and proliferation, as monitored by Ki-67 (Fig. 3D) was unaffected between control and
TGFBR2 knockdown cells upon tamoxifen treatment. Flow cytometric analysis of Annexin V (Fig. 3E) and immunostaining with
cleaved PARP revealed that the tamoxifen-induced apoptosis is
reduced in TGFBR2 knockdown cells (Fig. 3F) with statistical
signiﬁcance for the immunoﬂuorescence assay. Taken together,
our data demonstrate that the observed tamoxifen resistance in
TGFBR2 knockdown cells is due to a compromised ability to
induce apoptosis.
Altered signaling crosstalk in TGFBR2 knockdown cells
By Western blot analysis, we proved that TGFb-induced
phosphorylation of SMAD2 is abrogated in TGFBR2 knockdown cells (Fig. 3G), demonstrating the inability of cells to
activate the canonical TGFb pathway in the absence of the
ligand-binding receptor. Furthermore, we revealed that tamoxifen-induced ERa phosphorylation at serine-118 (pS118-ERa)
is abrogated and ERK1/2 phosphorylation (pERK) is completely abolished in TGFBR2 knockdown cells (Fig. 3G and H).
Decreased ERK phosphorylation has previously been reported
in siRNA-mediated TGFBR2 knockdown cells (36). Likewise,
estrogen-induced pS118-ERa and TGFb1–induced pERK were

www.aacrjournals.org

reduced in the presence of the TGFBR1 inhibitor SB431542
(Supplementary Fig. S4A).
We observed a slight but signiﬁcant induction of TGFb transcriptional activity upon tamoxifen treatment compared with
estrogen treatment alone, the regulation of which was completely
eradicated in TGFBR2 knockdown cells (Fig. 3I). Altogether, these
data highlight the role of the TGFb pathway in ERa and ERK
activation and its contribution to tamoxifen response.
TGFBR2 knockdown cells overexpress multidrug resistance
protein ABCG2
A customized mRNA array was employed to investigate differential gene expression of ERa downstream targets in the TGFBR2
knockdown cells. The array included probes for 91 genes involved
in proliferation, apoptosis, epithelial–mesenchymal transition,
stemness, or are linked to estrogen response (for full gene list, see
Supplementary Table S4).
Tamoxifen treatment resulted in the anticipated downregulation of estrogen-responsive genes such as CCND1, BMP6, and
CXCL12 (Table 3). Changes of apoptosis relevant genes were only
observed in control cells. BCL2, which encodes for an antiapoptotic molecule, was decreased in tamoxifen-treated control, but
not in TGFBR2 knockdown cells conﬁrming an impaired regulation of apoptosis in cells lacking TGFBR2.
TGFBR2 knockdown cells displayed 5- to 8-fold greater mRNA
expression levels for ABC-transporter ABCG2 compared with
control independent of treatment (Table 3). Overexpression of
ABCG2 in TGFBR2 knockdown cells was conﬁrmed by Western
blot analysis (Fig. 3J). Cells treated with the TGFBR1 inhibitor also
exhibited an increased level of ABCG2 (Supplementary Fig. S4D)
implying a role for the TGFb pathway in the regulation of ABCG2
expression potentially affecting multidrug resistance.
Long-term treated, tamoxifen-resistant cells acquired low
TGFBR2 expression
To further investigate the association between tamoxifen
resistance and the TGFb pathway, we compared a well established, TAM-R cell line (27) to tamoxifen-sensitive parental
MCF7.
Immunohistochemical staining revealed that TAM-R express
lower levels of TGFBR2 than MCF7 (Fig. 4A), although reduction
in mRNA levels was less prominent (Fig. 4B) potentially due to
additional changes in posttranscriptional regulation of TGFBR2
expression or receptor recycling or degradation. We further
observed increased ABCG2 and decreased ESR1/ERa levels on
RNA and protein level (Fig. 4B and C). Interestingly, TAM-R cells
remain estrogen-responsive, regulating proliferation and ERa
transcriptional activity (Fig. 4D and E). Whereas TGFb-induced
transcriptional activity and TGFb-mediated inhibition of ERa
transcriptional activity was unaffected in TAM-R cells (Supplementary Fig. S7A and S7B), regulation of TGFb transcriptional
activity was reversed upon estrogen and tamoxifen treatment
(Fig. 4F). Collectively, reporter assays reveal an altered ERa-TGFb
crosstalk, with aberrant ERa-mediated TGFb signal transduction
pathway activation. More importantly, tamoxifen-induced TGFb
signaling-mediated apoptosis may consequently be lost.
Recently, it could be demonstrated that long-term tamoxifen
exposure induces epigenetic silencing of estrogen-responsive
genes through promoter DNA methylation thereby facilitating
endocrine resistance (37). A number of studies have shown that

the TGFBR2 promoter region, which contains a CpG island, is a
target of epigenetic modulation mainly through histone deacetylation rather than DNA methylation (38). To validate this, we
treated MCF7 and TAM-R with a DNA demethylase agent (5-Aza20 -deoxycytidine) and a histone deacetylase inhibitor (Trichostatin A). We observed an about 2-fold increase in TGFBR2 expression when cells were treated with Trichostatin A, whereas DNA
demethylation increased TGFBR2 only slightly in tamoxifenresistant cells (Fig. 4G) emphasizing the more important role of
histone acetylation in TGFBR2 expression. In accordance, tamoxifen response was restored in TAM-R cells with a more pronounced effect using Trichostatin A. In MCF7, DNA demethylation by 5-Aza-20 -deoxycytidine had no effect, whereas Trichostatin A enhanced tamoxifen sensitivity (Fig. 4H) supporting that
DNA methylation is a preferred feature in endocrine-resistant
cells.
We further addressed the question whether increased TGFBR2
expression is linked to tamoxifen sensitivity more directly using a
TGFBR2 overexpression plasmid (pCMV5-XL6-TGFBR2). Transient plasmid transfection reinstated TGFBR2 expression in TAM-

1464 Cancer Res; 75(7) April 1, 2015

R cells (Supplementary Fig. S7C). TGFBR2 overexpression did not
affect estrogen response (Supplementary Fig. S7D) and we
observed only a minor improvement in tamoxifen sensitivity in
TAM-R cells (Supplementary Fig. S7E) possibly due to the presence of other resistance mechanisms. Reactivation of TGFBR2
expression alone may improve tamoxifen response to some extent
but does not seem sufﬁcient to fully overcome endocrine
resistance.

Discussion
TGFBR2 is an independent endocrine treatment–predictive
marker in invasive breast cancer
Here, we report that low TGFBR2 expression predicts tamoxifen resistance in premenopausal invasive breast cancer independent of other known prognostic factors. Consistent with
our ﬁnding, four independent gene expression datasets of
tamoxifen-treated, ERa-positive patients showed signiﬁcant
shorter recurrence-free survival of patients with low TGFBR2
expression.

NOTE: Differentially expressed genes (>2-fold changes) in MCF7 with TGFBR2-speciﬁc knockdown (TGFBR2-shRNA.1/2) compared to control (GFP-shRNA) in the
presence of 1 nmol/L estrogen with or without 0.1 mmol/L 4OHT or comparing treatments within each cell line. Analysis was performed using SABiosciences' webbased PCR data analysis tool for customized RT2 Proﬁler PCR Array. Data represent two independent experiments.
a
This gene's expression is relatively low in one sample and reasonably detected in the other sample, suggesting that the actual fold change value is at least as large as
the calculated and reported fold change result.
b
This gene's relative expression level is low in both control and test samples. This fold change result may have greater variations.

In accordance, Vendrell and colleagues reported a 47-gene
signature associated with tamoxifen failure (39) including lower
TGFBR2 levels in tamoxifen-resistant tumor samples. Another
study reported the presence of inhibitory TGFBR2 mutations in
recurrent breast cancer (40). All tumor samples in this study were
derived from patients having undergone adjuvant tamoxifen
treatment hinting that mutational inactivation of TGFBR2 may
contribute to tamoxifen resistance.
Low TGFBR2 expression has previously been shown to be
associated with longer overall survival in patients with ERanegative breast cancer (14). Stratifying the clinical cohort used
in this study according to ERa status, we did not ﬁnd a
statistically signiﬁcant link of TGFBR2 expression to recur-

1466 Cancer Res; 75(7) April 1, 2015

rence-free survival in the untreated patient group. However,
ERa-negative patients with low TGFBR2 expression had a
slightly better prognosis, but patient numbers were relatively
low (Supplementary Fig. S8A). Examining tumor samples in
regard to high SMAD2 phosphorylation (pSMAD2), there was a
nonsigniﬁcant trend (P ¼ 0.128) for shorter recurrence-free
survival for ERa-negative, but not for ERa-positive patients
(Supplementary Fig. S8B). Taken together, our data indicate
that the TGFb pathway may act in a tumor-promotive or
-suppressive manner depending on the ERa status. Targeting
the TGFb pathway in ERa-negative breast cancer might therefore
prevent tumor progression, whereas this approach may prove
to be an unfavorable strategy in ERa-positive breast cancer.

Low TGFBR2 expression in ERa-positive breast cancer cells is
associated with tamoxifen resistance and deregulated ERa and
TGFb signaling
Analysis of an established TAM-R cell line with downregulated
expression levels of TGFBR2 signiﬁes that loss of TGFBR2 plays a
role in the acquisition of endocrine resistance. In the current
study, we reveal that shRNA-induced loss of TGFBR2 expression
in antiestrogen sensitive ERa-positive breast cancer cells gives rise
to an impaired response toward estrogen and tamoxifen through
alterations in proliferation and induction of apoptosis.
Interestingly, TGFBR2-speciﬁc knockdown and TAM-R cells
maintain estrogen responsiveness, however, with considerably
elevated ERa transcriptional activity. It has been reported previously that tamoxifen-resistant breast cancer exhibit enhanced ERa
binding including additional ERa binding regions and that
enhanced ERa-binding capacity was associated with worse clinical outcome (41).
Furthermore, site-speciﬁc ERa phosphorylation has been
implicated as an important posttranslational regulatory mecha-

nism enabling crosstalk between signaling pathways, and several
phosphorylation sites have been linked to endocrine response
(42, 43). Serine-118 ERa phosphorylation, described as a predictor for tamoxifen sensitivity (30), was linked to TGFBR2
expression in the clinical cohort and in our experimental settings.
Various studies have described a relationship between antiestrogens and the TGFb pathway. The clinical efﬁcacy of tamoxifen in breast cancer has been attributed to growth arrest and
induction of apoptosis (44, 45) also via TGFb signaling (46, 47).
Our data support that tamoxifen-induced apoptosis seems
to be at least partly mediated by the canonical TGFb pathway.
However, deregulated TGFb transcriptional activation, as
observed in TGFBR2 knockdown and TAM-R cells, is potentially
impeding tamoxifen-induced apoptosis, thus contributing to
drug resistance. We further noted increased expression level of
ATP-binding cassette (ABC) efﬂux transporter ABCG2, also
referred to as breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP), in TGFBR2
knockdown and TAM-R cells. ABCG2 as a multidrug resistance
protein confers cells with the capability to pump out large

hydrophobic molecules including therapeutic agents. Recently, it
has been reported that ABCG2 is able to recognize and efﬂux
tamoxifen (48). Cells with elevated levels of ABCG2 may therefore become insensitive to tamoxifen due to limited drug exposure. ABCG2 expression has been shown to be negatively regulated by the TGFb and ERK pathway (49). Upregulation of ABCG2
may thus be mediated through the abrogation of activated ERK
signaling as observed in TGFBR2 knockdown cells.
It has been demonstrated that long-term tamoxifen exposure
induces epigenetic silencing of estrogen-responsive genes that
negatively regulate proliferation (37). Reactivation of identiﬁed
genes was achieved through inhibition of promoter DNA
methylation, which restored estrogen-dependent cell proliferation and tamoxifen sensitivity. Using epigenetic regulators, we
noted an upregulation of TGFBR2 mRNA expression in tamoxifen-resistant cells concomitantly with a resensitization to
tamoxifen treatment.
In summary, our study provides further evidence for a crosslink
between the ERa and TGFb pathway and its implication in
endocrine resistance. We demonstrate that TGFBR2 is an independent treatment-predictive biomarker in breast cancer and
hypothesize that loss of TGFBR2 contributes to the acquisition
of resistance mechanisms through (i) deregulation of ERa signaling (activation, phosphorylation), (ii) impaired induction of
apoptosis via TGFb signaling, and (iii) ABCG2-mediated drug
desensitization.
The acquisition of tamoxifen resistance in some ERa-positive
breast cancer patients may be a consequence of epigenetic silencing of TGFBR2 expression, which has been reported to be an early
event in breast tumorigenesis (50). Thus, epigenetic therapies may

represent a novel therapeutic approach in these patients; however,
they may prove challenging due the dual nature of TGFb.
