Abstract
There is marked disparity with a slight overlap among
prognosis-predictive signatures reported thus far for lung
cancers. In this study, we aimed at linking poor prognosis with
particular pathways and/or functions of the gene sets involved
to better understand the underlying molecular characteristics
associated with the prognosis of lung adenocarcinomas. Gene
set enrichment analysis identified a gene set down-regulated
by rapamycin as the most significant, whereas several others
responsive to withdrawal of glucose or amino acids, which are
related to signaling converging onto mammalian target of
rapamycin (mTOR), were also shown to be significantly
associated, in addition to those related to DNA damage
response and cell cycle progression. We also used connectivity
map (C-MAP) analysis, an independent bioinformatics approach, to search for Food and Drug Administration–
approved drugs that potentially transform an unfavorable
signature to a favorable one. Those results identified
inhibitors of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) and mTOR,
as well as unexpected drugs such as phenothiazine antipsychotics and resveratrol as potential candidates. Experimental
validation revealed that the latter unexpected agents also
inhibited signaling converging onto mTOR and exhibited
antitumor activities. In addition, deregulation of multiple
signaling converging onto mTOR was shown to be significantly
associated with sensitivity to PI-103, a dual specificity PI3K/
mTOR inhibitor that is not contained in the C-MAP database,
lending further support for the connection. Our results clearly
show the existence of gene set–definable, intrinsic heterogeneities in lung adenocarcinomas, which seem to be related
to both clinical behavior and sensitivity to agents affecting the
identified pathways. [Cancer Res 2009;69(9):4027–35]

Introduction
Adenocarcinomas exhibit the highest degree of morphologic and
clinical diversities among the various types of lung cancers, and it

is well recognized that their current pathologic classification and
ability to predict postsurgical prognosis are quite inadequate.
Although the existence of marked heterogeneity, including their
expression profiles, is well appreciated (1), virtually all adenocarcinomas are currently treated similarly under the diagnosis of non–
small cell lung cancer. Along this line, better understanding of
molecular heterogeneities is considered to be one of the major
factors that has significantly improved cure rates of certain types of
neoplasia, such as hematologic malignancies and breast cancer.
Thus, a better understanding of the underlying molecular
mechanisms of the heterogeneities among lung adenocarcinomas
is greatly anticipated to contribute to reducing the unbearably
large number of deaths by establishing a foundation for rational
individualized treatment strategies, as well as development of novel
therapeutic methods.
The tumor-node metastasis staging system is currently used as
the standard method for predicting prognosis, whereas a number
of individualized molecular signature-based predictions that
partition patients into distinct prognostic groups have also been
developed, including our own, which have shown good results for
predicting patients with dismal prognosis (2–6). However, there is a
marked discordance with a slight overlap among such predictive
signatures thus far reported for lung cancers. This disparity makes
it difficult to reconcile them in relation to the underlying molecular
characteristics, which has led to criticism stating that such models
do not provide biological insight.
In this study, we used two independent bioinformatics
approaches, gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA; ref. 7) and
connectivity map (C-MAP; ref. 8) analysis, in combination with
biological and biochemical experiments for validation, to
elucidate the underlying molecular basis for the link of poor
prognosis with particular pathways and/or functions of the gene
sets involved. Consequently, well-defined and easily interpretable
gene sets were identified as associated with fatal outcome,
providing insight into the existence of intrinsic heterogeneities in
lung adenocarcinomas and the usability of in silico screening for
potential antitumor agents with activities to revert a fatal
signature to a favorable one.

Materials and Methods
Bioinformatics and biostatistics analyses. Clinical characteristics,
such as length of the follow-up period, are described in Supplementary
Materials and Methods. The Nagoya data set of microarray analysis
(GEO GSE 11969), previously reported by our group (1), was used in two
independent bioinformatics analyses. Two additional data sets reported by
Harvard (9) and Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center (10) groups were

also used for validation. GSEA was performed using the GSEA version 1.0
program for R (7). C-MAP analysis was performed using the tool7 described
by Lamb and colleagues (8). Detailed methodologic information for the
present GSEA and C-MAP analyses is provided in Supplementary Materials
and Methods. The CLUSTER program was used for average linkage
hierarchical clustering of both genes and cases, whereas the TREEVIEW
program was used for display (11). Fisher’s exact test was performed to
examine associations of the deregulation score–based clusters with various
clinical parameters, whereas Cox regression analysis was used to analyze
the relationships among various parameters, including deregulation score–
based clusters and postoperative prognosis. All statistical tests were two
sided.
Cell lines. ACC-LC-94, ACC-LC-176, and ACC-LC-319 cells were
established in our laboratory, whereas the A549, A427, and NCI-H23 cell
lines were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection. The
SK-LU-1, SK-LC-3, SK-LC-5, and SK-LC-7 cell lines were generously provided
by Lloyd J. Old (Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center). Cells were
cultured in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum
(Invitrogen-Life Technologies, Inc.).
Growth inhibition assays. Growth inhibition was assessed by an MTS
assay using the TetraColor ONE kit (Seikagaku) according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. Each combination of cell line and drug was
set up in six replicate wells, and the experiment was repeated at least thrice.
Each data point presented in the assay results represents the growth of
treated cells compared with untreated cells.
Small interfering RNA knockdown. A synthetic small interfering RNA
(siRNA) duplex composed of rictor (Dharmacon) and scramble (QIAGEN)
was transfected using Lipofectamine RNAiMAX (Invitrogen) according to
the manufacturer’s instructions. Twenty-four hours after siRNA transfection, cells were seeded (3  103/100 AL) into 96-well plates, incubated
overnight, and treated with or without rapamycin for 72 h. Viability was
measured using a 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. Down-regulation of rictor was confirmed 5 d after
transfection by Western blot analysis.

Results
Identification of gene sets associated with relapse in lung
adenocarcinomas. We performed GSEA using our previous data
set containing 90 lung adenocarcinomas (the Nagoya data set;
ref. 1) to identify gene sets with a clear association with relapse.
First, data from 42 favorable samples (alive >5 years after surgery
without any evidence of relapse) and 33 fatal samples (dead with
evidence of relapse after initial surgery) were extracted, and
GSEA consequently identified eight gene sets with significant
associations with a fatal outcome (Fig. 1A and B; Supplementary
Tables S1–S5). A GSEA gene set, which was originally selected
because of down-regulation in the presence of rapamycin
(Rap_down), exhibited the most significant enrichment of all
queried genes associated with relapse-related death. Three
other significantly enriched gene sets included those reduced by
either glucose deprivation (Glucose_down), leucine deprivation
(Leu_down), or glutamine deprivation (Glut_down; Fig. 1B), which
seemed to be consistent with the notion that the mammalian
target of rapamycin (mTOR) is a converging point of growth factor
receptor signaling with nutrient availability and energy status
of the cell (12–14). For the sake of convenience, these gene sets
are herein termed metabolic pathway gene sets. In addition, gene
sets related to cell cycle and DNA damage signaling also showed
a significant association with fatal outcome.

Next, we determined whether similar gene sets could be selected
by GSEA using the completely independent data set of 62 lung
adenocarcinoma cases presented by the Harvard group, for which
information regarding both relapse and death are available (9). The
Leu_down (P = 0.0238), Cell_Cycle (P = 0.0444), and DNA damage
signaling (P = 0.0500) gene sets were shown to be significantly
associated with relapse-related death in that data set, whereas
Rap_down (P = 0.0833), CR_cell_cycle (P = 0.0851), and Glut_down
(P = 0.0976) were also included in the top 10 gene sets, although the
results for those did not reach statistical significance. These findings
further supported the involvement of these gene sets in signatures
associated with clinical behavior (Supplementary Table S6).
Associations of deregulation of GSEA-identified gene sets
with various clinicopathologic characteristics. To investigate
associations between the levels of perturbation in each of the
GSEA-identified gene sets and various clinicopathologic characteristics, we defined a ‘‘deregulation index’’ for each gene set, which
was calculated by averaging the normalized gene expression values.
The deregulation index values clearly separated between fatal and
favorable prognosis (Fig. 1C; Supplementary Fig. S1), as well as
between terminal respiratory unit (TRU) and non-TRU types, our
previously proposed expression profile-substantiated classification
of adenocarcinomas (Supplementary Fig. S2; ref. 1). Interestingly,
even tumors from patients with a favorable prognosis exhibited a
more prominent perturbation state than normal lung tissue
samples. Hierarchical clustering analysis using the deregulation
indices of the four metabolic pathway gene sets was also
performed, which resulted in clear separation of two major
branches (Fig. 2A). The right branch preferentially consisted of
tumors with pronounced deregulation and characteristically
harbored male gender and positive smoking history (Supplementary Table S7; P = 0.019 and P = 0.002, respectively). We also noted a
significant association of deregulation state with the presence of
bronchioloalveolar carcinoma features (P = 0.002), as well as with
TRU type (P < 0.001; Supplementary Table S7). Mutations in the
epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and K-ras genes did not
show any associations (P = 0.659 for EGFR and P = 0.735 for K-ras),
although there was a tendency for a more prevalent presence
of p53 mutations in the right branch with greater deregulation
(P = 0.071 for p53). Kaplan-Meier survival curves showed a
significant difference in relapse-free survival between the highderegulation and low-deregulation clusters, whereas multivariate
Cox regression analysis revealed that deregulation cluster discrimination was a significant independent prognostic factor (P = 0.009)
in addition to disease stage (P = 0.009; Fig. 2B).
The associations of deregulation state with prognosis and other
variables were further validated using another independent data
set from the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center (10).
Hierarchical clustering analysis based on the deregulation indices
of the four metabolic pathway gene sets resulted in clear separation
of two major branches, which showed that cases in the cluster with
pronounced deregulation characteristically harbored positive
smoking history (P = 0.010; Supplementary Table S8; Fig. 2C).
Notably, we confirmed that cases with pronounced deregulation
had significantly worse prognosis than those in the other cluster
(Fig. 2D), whereas multivariate Cox regression analysis revealed
that deregulation cluster discrimination was significantly associated with postoperative prognosis independent of disease stage
(P = 0.012), further supporting the notion that deregulation of the
metabolic pathways was a generic signature observed in patients
with a high risk for relapse and fatal prognosis.

with potential to revert fatal signatures of the gene sets. To
identify agents with antitumor effects by searching for those that
potentially alter a fatal prognosis–associated signature to a
favorable prognosis–associated one, we performed C-MAP analysis,
another completely distinct bioinformatics method. C-MAP is a
library of signatures of drug response in a database used for queries
regarding expression information to clarify potential association
with other biological contexts, thereby linking otherwise unrelated
physiologic events (8, 15). For this analysis, we selected 477 probes
derived from 332 up-regulated and 145 down-regulated genes that
were significantly differentially expressed (P < 0.05 by t test)
between those who survived without relapse for >5 years and those
who died with relapse in 75 cases of lung adenocarcinomas in the

Nagoya data set and used them as query items to compare to rankordered lists for each drug treatment in the C-MAP database. We
identified multiple Food and Drug Administration (FDA)–approved
drugs with a significantly biased appearance of the query genes
closer to the top of the rank-ordered list, indicating the induction
of significant down-regulation in 332 genes with relapse-related
death-associated up-regulation by a given drug treatment, as well
as significant up-regulation of the 145 genes down-regulated by the
treatment (Table 1). The results of Kolmogorov-Smirnov scanning
of the sixth-ranked sirolimus in the C-MAP analysis are shown in
Fig. 3A, which showed enrichment of the favorable (downregulated) and fatal (up-regulated) signatures, whereas summaries
of all instances of sirolimus and LY-294002 are shown in Fig. 3B.

cancer-related kinase inhibitors, C-MAP analysis also identified

several other unexpected agents with distant connections to cancer
treatment, which included phenothiazine antipsychotics (prochlorperazine, trifluoperazine, fluphenazine, and thioridazine) and
resveratrol, raising the possibility that these agents may also
inhibit the same signaling pathways, exhibiting antitumor effects.

Deregulated Signaling with mTOR in Lung Adenocarcinoma

Finally, we analyzed whether changes in gene expression before
and after rapamycin treatment in the ACC-LC-94 and A549 lung
cancer cell lines corresponded to those in MCF-7, because the
C-MAP database is mainly based on the expression profiling results
in the MCF-7 breast cancer cell line. As a result, C-MAP analysis
using the extracted probe sets exhibiting a significant response to
rapamycin faithfully selected sirolimus (rapamycin) as significant
(Supplementary Tables S10 and S11; P = 0.0079 in ACC-LC-94 and
P = 0.0105 in A549 by permutation test).
Experimental validation of results obtained by the C-MAP
analysis. To experimentally validate our results obtained by
C-MAP analysis, we examined the growth inhibitory activities of
the C-MAP–identified agents using a panel of lung cancer cell
lines. Rapamycin and LY-294002 exhibited growth inhibitory
activities in MTT assays, as expected, whereas prochlorperazine
and resveratrol treatments also resulted in growth inhibition,
athough rapamycin did not reach 50% growth inhibition with most
of the lung cancer cell lines tested in this study (Supplementary
Fig. S4). Notably, there was a significant inhibition of phosphorylation of p70 S6K, a downstream effecter of mTOR, in the A549
adenocarcinoma cell line by treatment with not only rapamycin
and LY-294002 but also prochlorperazine and resveratrol. Inhibition of AKT phosphorylation was also detected in A549 cells
treated with resveratrol or LY-294002, whereas prochlorperazine
elicited a delayed induction of AKT similar to that observed with
rapamycin (Fig. 3C). In addition, the expression of EGFR was
down-regulated by treatment with prochlorperazine via a currently
unknown mechanism (Supplementary Fig. S5). In addition to
down-regulation of the prosurvival effectors, resveratrol induced
marked phosphorylation of p38 MAP kinase, a proapoptotic
effector, as well as modest phosphorylation of AMP kinase, which
is activated by deprivation of cellular energy (13, 14), leading to
inhibition of mTOR activity (Fig. 3D). These results showed that
these compounds, which were identified in silico, as drugs with
potential activities to alter a relapse-related death signature have

effects on pathways converging onto mTOR with antitumor
activities in vitro.
Requirement of inhibition of both mTORC1 and TORC2 for
growth suppression of lung cancer cells. The modest growth
inhibitory activity seen for the mTOR-inhibiting rapamycin led us
to investigate the contribution of a delayed reactivation of AKT
induced by rapamycin. Rapamycin treatment diminished the
binding of mTOR with raptor, although a complex of mTOR and
rictor (mTORC2) was still formed in the presence of rapamycin
(Fig. 4A). siRNA-mediated knockdown of rictor caused a
significant reduction in cell growth, which was enhanced by
combined use with rapamycin (Fig. 4B). A reduction in the
expression of rictor decreased the levels of phosphorylation of
both AKT and FoxO3a, well-established direct substrates of AKT,
whereas the phosphorylation of S6 kinase was marginally
inhibited by knockdown of rictor (Fig. 4C), showing that
simultaneous inhibition of mTORC1 and mTORC2 effectively
inhibits cell growth in lung adenocarcinomas. In line with this
observation, combined treatment of rapamycin with LY-294002
exhibited inhibition of rapamycin-mediated reactivation of AKT,
in association with a more pronounced cell growth inhibition in
lung cancer cell lines (Supplementary Fig. S6). We also found that
concomitant treatment with resveratrol similarly inhibited
reactivation of AKT in lung cancer cell lines treated with
rapamycin (Fig. 4D).
Association of deregulation of GSEA-identified gene sets
with sensitivity to the multikinase inhibitor PI-103. Our
findings of effective growth inhibition of lung adenocarcinoma
cells by combined inhibition of signaling involving PI3K,
mTORC1, and mTORC2 led us to examine the inhibitory effects
of PI-103, a small molecule with the capability to inhibit those
three (Supplementary Fig. S7), in relation to the deregulation state
of signaling converging onto mTOR (16, 17). Treatment with
PI-103 clearly inhibited phosphorylation of AKT and S6K, as well
as PDK1 downstream of PI3K in a dose-dependent manner in

Intriguingly, the cumulative deregulation score, which we defined
on the basis of the cumulative deregulation of each gene set,
including Rap_down, Glucose_down, Leu_down, and Glut_down,
was found to be associated with sensitivities to PI-103 in each
lung adenocarcinoma cell line (Fig. 5B; r = 0.667, P = 0.025 by
Pearson’s correlation coefficient), suggesting the potential
usefulness of such a cumulative deregulation score for predicting

the sensitivity to PI-103 and possibly of other agents simultaneously affecting multiple molecules in pathways converging onto
mTOR.

Discussion
Rapid proliferation of cancer cells causes an insufficient blood
supply, which elicits a variety of environmental stresses, such as
deprivation of growth factors, nutrients, and/or oxygen. However,
cancer cells are thought to be capable of surviving in spite of such

constraints, which conceivably leads to disease progression and
ultimately confers poor prognosis in affected patients. A number of
studies have aimed at identifying a list of genes related to lung
cancer prognosis (2, 3, 10, 18–21); however, criticism is frequently
raised noting that the gene lists used in such prognosis prediction
classifiers have minimal overlaps and provide little biological
insight into the underlying mechanisms. In a related study, Bild and
colleagues analyzed artificially generated cells with overexpression
of various oncogenes in vitro and identified oncogenic pathway
signatures with a potential to separate lung cancer patients into
subgroups in relation to outcome, including drug sensitivity (22). In
contrast, the present study, which used two independent bioinformatics approaches, namely GSEA and C-MAP analysis, directly
used expression profiles of patient tumors. We specifically designed
our study to focus on the underlying molecular basis linking poor
prognosis with particular pathways and/or functions of the gene
sets involved, which showed the association of deregulation of

multiple signaling converging onto mTOR with relapse and death
in lung adenocarcinoma patients.
Activation of the PI3K-AKT-mTOR axis plays a key role in
growth factor receptor–mediated signaling for cancer cell growth
and survival, whereas LKB1, which is inactivated in a fraction of
lung adenocarcinomas (23, 24), activates AMP kinase in microenvironmental conditions, including insufficient nutrients, and
leads to inhibition of mTOR activity in an AKT-independent
manner (13, 14). In addition, amino acids, such as leucine,
regulate mTOR signaling, which involves raptor, a ras homologue
enriched in the brain, and a GTPase that activates mTOR, which
are directly associated with mTOR (25, 26). This study is the first
to report that the expression state of genes affected by
withdrawal of amino acids is significantly altered in association
with poor prognosis, suggesting that adaptation to an insufficient
availability of amino acids may be a prerequisite for the
progression of lung adenocarcinomas. In addition, the expression
state of genes responsive to glucose withdrawal was found to be
altered in tumors associated with a fatal outcome at a more
pronounced level, a finding consistent with a previous report by
Chen and colleagues that found increased expression of glycolytic
enzymes in association with poor prognosis (27). In our
multivariate Cox regression analysis, deregulation of mTORconverging signaling seemed to be an independent prognostic
factor in addition to disease stage, whereas such statistical
significance was not observed with various other parameters,

including mutations of EGFR, K-ras, and p53, as well as
bronchioloalveolar carcinoma features and TRU/non-TRU classification. Multivariate Cox regression analysis of the Memorial
Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center data sets also showed similar
associations, supporting the notion that deregulation of mTORconverging signaling may be a generic signature in patients with a
high risk for relapse and fatal outcome. It is interesting that two
independent groups recently reported a lack of prognostic value
of LKB1 inactivation in lung cancers (28, 29), whereas conflicting
results were presented in terms of the association between poor
prognosis and AKT phosphorylation (30–32). Therefore, it is
possible that an altered state of multiple signaling converging
onto mTOR may be more reflected in clinical behavior rather
than a given molecule in the pathways.
Also interesting is that our in silico search using C-MAP analysis
for drugs with activities that potentially revert a fatal prognosisassociated signature to a favorable prognosis-associated one
resulted in identification of not only well-known inhibitors of
PI3K or mTOR, but also several unexpected ones, such as those
with antitumor activities in vitro. It has been reported that whereas
rapamycin and its derivatives exhibit considerable antitumor
activity in certain tumor types, including renal cell carcinoma,
mantle cell lymphoma, and endometrial cancers, lung cancers are
rather resistant with response rates of <10% (33). In this
connection, the present results obtained with siRNA-mediated
silencing of rictor in the presence of rapamycin suggest that
enhanced effectiveness may be attained by concomitant inhibition
of mTORC1 and mTORC2. We also unexpectedly identified drugs,
including phenothiazine antipsychotics (prochlorperazine, trifluoperazine, fluphenazine, and thioridazine), an antihelminthic
(pyrvinium), and resveratrol, a chemopreventive agent (34). In
addition, prochlorperazine was shown here for the first time to
inhibit mTOR-mediated signaling and induce a delayed phosphorylation of AKT in a manner similar to rapamycin. It is also
important to note that both rapamycin and prochlorperazine have
abilities to promote autophagy (35), a cellular response to a growth

factor/nutrient–deprived condition. Pyrvinium was previously
shown to inhibit cancer cell survival by blocking AKT signaling
specifically in a nutrient-starved condition, which is also consistent
with the present findings (36). Interestingly, whereas this study
showed that PI-103, a dual specificity kinase inhibitor, inhibited
growth of lung adenocarcinoma cell lines through concurrent
inhibition of PI3K and mTOR without AKT feedback activation, we
observed an inverse relationship between cumulative deregulation
score, i.e., extent of augmentation in the expression signatures of
gene sets related to mTOR-converging signaling, and sensitivity
to PI-103, providing further support to a functionally relevant
connection.
In conclusion, using two independent bioinformatics approaches, we identified a significant association between deregulation of signaling converging onto mTOR and poor prognosis
in lung adenocarcinomas, suggesting the existence of gene set–
definable, intrinsic heterogeneities in this devastating tumor type.
In addition, our results lend support to the notion that compounds
identified by in silico screening as having potential activities
to alter signatures associated with relapse and death to favorable
ones can be anticipated to show antitumor activities and inhibitory
effects on pathways converging onto mTOR.
