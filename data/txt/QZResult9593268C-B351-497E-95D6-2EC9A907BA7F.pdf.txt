ABSTRACT
Anticancer therapies that induce DNA damage tend to trigger senescence in
cancer cells, a process known as therapy-induced senescence (TIS). Such cells may
undergo atypical divisions, thus contributing to tumor re-growth. Accumulation of
senescent cancer cells reduces survival of patients after chemotherapy. As senescence
interplays with autophagy, a dynamic recycling process, we sought to study whether
inhibition of autophagy interferes with divisions of TIS cells. We exposed human
colon cancer HCT116 cells to repeated cycles of a chemotherapeutic agent –
doxorubicin (doxo) and demonstrated induction of hallmarks of TIS (e.g. growth
arrest, hypertrophy, poliploidization and secretory phenotype) and certain properties
of cancer stem cells (increased NANOG expression, percentages of CD24+ cells and
side population). Colonies of small and highly proliferative progeny appeared shortly
after drug removal. Treatment with bafilomycin A1 (BAF A1), an autophagy inhibitor,
postponed short term in vitro cell re-population. It was associated with reduction in
the number of diploid and increase in the number of poliploid cells. In a long term, a
pulse of BAF A1 resulted in reactivation of autophagy in a subpopulation of HCT116
cells and increased proliferation. Accordingly, the senescent HCT116 cells treated with
BAF A1 when injected into NOD/SCID mice formed tumors, in contrast to the controls.
Our results suggest that senescent cancer cells that appear during therapy, can be
considered as dormant cells that contribute to cancer re-growth, when chemotherapeutic
treatment is stopped. These data unveil new mechanisms of TIS-related cancer
maintenance and re-population, triggered by a single pulse of BAF A1 treatment.

benefits and severe side effects [2]. Poor outcomes are
related to heterogeneity of tumors, their clonal evolution
and intrinsic drug resistance of cancer cells. One of
the postulated mechanisms responsible for the latter
is the therapy-induced senescence (TIS). Senescence
is a state of irreversible growth arrest of normal cells,

when they reach the end of their replicative lifespan
[3]. Conversely, a stress-induced premature senescence
(SIPS), which could be triggered by oxidative stress
or DNA damaging agents, is an acute, short-term and
telomere shortening-independent event [4]. Apart from an
irreversible growth arrest, senescent cells exhibit several
morphological and biochemical changes: increased
size and granularity, augmented activity of senescenceassociated β-Galactosidase (SA-β-Gal), activation of the
DNA damage response (DDR) and mTOR pathway, and
senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) [4–7].
Recent clinical studies have demonstrated that cancer cells
may undergo SIPS in response to chemotherapy [8–13].
However, a growing body of evidence supports correlation
between accumulation of TIS cancer cells and reduced
survival of patients subjected to anticancer treatment
[5, 8–11, 14]. This could be attributed to SASP-related
remodeling of tumor environment [5, 15] and/or atypical
senescent cell divisions [16–18]. A few studies showed
that senescent cells transiently display stem cell properties
[19, 20]. The cancer stem cell (CSC) model suggests
that only a small subset is responsible for sustaining
tumorigenesis and tumor re-growth after therapy
[21]. CSCs exhibit the stem cell properties including
a self-renewal and an ability to differentiate [22–24].
Quiescent or slow cycling CSCs may survive therapeutic
intervention, which results in tumor relapse [21].
Non-proliferating cells are not able to redistribute
and eliminate damaged organelles, proteins or aggregates
through cell division [25]. Therefore, autophagy, a
controlled lysosomal degradation of macromolecules
and organelles [26], may be essential for senescent cells
[27]. Indeed, autophagy was reported to facilitate rapid
protein turnover that can trigger recycling of proteins into
SASP factors [28]. Accordingly, autophagy was reported
to be crucial for maintaining stemness [29]. Increasing
evidence indicates the importance of autophagy in
human cancer cells both for drug-induced cell death
and as a self-protective mechanism [30–32]. Inhibiting
autophagy to overcome resistance to chemotherapy
has been investigated in five clinical phase I trials
where hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) was combined with
chemotherapeutics. Nonetheless, additional mechanistic
studies in preclinical models are necessary to support
clinical application of autophagy inhibitors [33]. In
particular, relationship between TIS-associated remodeling
and induction of tumorigenic capacity of senescent cancer
cells needs to be investigated.
Here, we characterize properties of drug-induced
senescent colon cancer cells in long term cultures. We
have investigated whether inhibition of autophagy by
a single pulse of bafilomycin A1 (BAF A1), a specific
inhibitor of lysosomal acidification, affects their ability to
re-populate in vitro cultures and to form tumors in NOD/
SCID mice.

Senescent colon cancer HCT116 cells exhibit
stem-cell like properties and re-populate culture
after chemotherapeutic removal
To mimic a regime of chemotherapy in patients, we
subjected human colon cancer HCT116 cell cultures to
long-term, repeated treatment with a chemotherapeutic
drug. Cells were treated with 100 nM doxorubicin
(doxo, D) for 24 hours. Following its removal, the cells
were cultured in the drug-free medium for the next 3 days.
The cycle was repeated three times (Figure 1A, CHEMO
protocol). Subsequently, to mimic a post chemotherapy
period, we cultured HCT116 cells in the drug-free medium
for additional 14 days, with the medium changed every four
days (Figure 1A, AFTER CHEMO protocol). On the 13th
day the CHEMO-treated cells exhibited several features of
senescence: flatten morphology (Figure 1B), increased size
and granularity (Figure 1B, 1C, Supplementary Figure S1A),
augmented SA-β-gal activity (Figure 1D, Supplementary
Figure S1B) and polyploidization (Figure 1E, Supplementary
Figure S1C). Moreover, the elevated expression of DDR
proteins: γ-H2A.X, p-p53, and p21, and geroconversion
markers [7]: cyclin D1 and p-S6 (Figure 1F) was detectable.
In addition, the cells up-regulated secretion of SASP factors:
VEGF and IL-8 (Figure 1G).
We observed the six-fold increase in the number
of cells within two weeks after doxo removal (p < 0.001,
Figure 2A). Using a time-lapse technique we confirmed
that senescent, hypertrophic HCT116 cells give rise to
viable, migrating and proliferating progeny (Figure 2B,
Supplementary Movie S1). Among the cells treated with
CHEMO protocol the cells with stem-cell like properties
were observed, as a fraction of CD24+ cells (Figure 2C)
and the percentage of cells excluding H33342 (Figure 2D,
Supplementary Figure S2A) increased. Only a small part
of the latter subpopulation was sensitive to Verapamil,
an inhibitor of ABCB1 and ABCC1 pumps (Figure 2E).
These cells also expressed a stemness factor NANOG
(Figure 2F). On the other hand, we found that the number
of CD133+ (Supplementary Figure S2B) and CD44+
(Supplementary Figure S2C) cells as well as the ALDH
activity (Supplementary Figure S2D) were reduced in
treated cultures. During doxo administration HCT116 cells
retained red-fluorescent, membrane dye Dil. That indicates
the lack of proliferation (Figure 2G, Supplementary S2E),
as in proliferating cells Dil staining is reduced with each
division. Accordingly, after doxo removal the percentage
of Dil+ cells decreased significantly, that suggests their
intensive proliferation (Figure 2G, Supplementary
Figure S2E). Unlike the untreated HCT116 cells, their
senescent counterparts remained in non-proliferating state
(Dil+) for many days, before they formed spheroids in
matrigel (Supplementary Figure S2F). These observations

A single pulse of BAF A1 transiently blocks
autophagy in drug-senescent colon cancer cells

are compatible with the fact that the expression of
Ki67 was lost in the course of drug administration
(Figure 2H, 2I). This protein is expressed in all cell
cycle phases, except G0 [34]. Our results show that upon
doxo treatment a majority of HCT116 cells do not enter
cell cycle. Altogether, we demonstrate that the repeated
doxorubicin treatment induces senescence of HCT116
cells, but drug removal leads to re-population of cell
cultures. Moreover, the data presented here suggest that
senescent cancer cells exhibit some features of cancer
stem cells.

To test whether inhibition of autophagy affects
division of senescent cancer cells, after the 3rd
doxorubicin’s cycle, HCT116 cells were treated with
10 nM BAF A1 (B) for 24 hours. The inhibitor was then
removed and the cells were cultured in the drug-free medium
for the next 13 days (Figure 3A, AFTER CHEMO + BAF
A1 protocol). BAF A1 is an inhibitor of the late phase of
autophagy, as it prevents maturation of autophagic vacuoles

[35]. Using red-fluorescent dye Lysotracker, which labels
acidic organelles, we show that fluorescence intensity
measured by flow cytometry was significantly higher in cells

treated with CHEMO protocol than in untreated cells (p <

reduced on the 14th day after co-incubation with BAF A1

expression of two markers of autophagy - p62/SQSTM1
and LC3B. During autophagy, a cytosolic form of LC3B
(LC3B-I) is conjugated to phosphatidylethanolamine to form
LC3-phosphatidylethanolamine conjugate (LC3B-II), which
is recruited to autophagosomal membranes. Then, LC3BII is degraded by lysosomal hydrolases after the fusion of
autophagosomes with lysosomes. p62/SQSTM1 (p62), a
ubiquitin- and LC3-binding protein, is directly degraded by
autophagy [35]. Using western blotting, we demonstrate that
the level of p62 was reduced and LC3BII/LC3BI ratio was
increased by the CHEMO protocol (Figure 3C). Moreover,
BAF A1 treatment up-regulated expression of p62 and LC3B
(both forms). It is noteworthy that inhibition of autophagy was
maintained for at least seven days after removal of BAF A1
(Figure 3C). Using immunofluorescence we verified
that a robust accumulation of p62 and LC3B occurs in
BAF A1-treated cells on the 17th day. However, not all
cells expressing LC3B were positive for p62. It suggests
that autophagy was re-activated (Figure 3D). Likewise,
lysosomal activity (measured by flow cytometry) in cells
treated with the AFTER CHEMO + BAF A1 protocol was
strongly enhanced on days 14 and 21. On the 21st day, these
cells exhibited 3 times higher mean fluorescence intensity (p
< 0.01, Figure 3B, 3F) and the cultures were characterized
by higher number of granular cells when compared to
controls (p < 0.01, Figure 3E). As shown in Figure 3C, the
expression of p62 was reduced and LC3BII/ LC3BI ratio
increased strongly on the 25th day in BAF A1-treated cells,
which further confirms re-activation of autophagy. Analysis
of the images showing lysosomes and DNA staining (e.g.
Figure 3F) demonstrated that after BAF A1 treatment the
activity of lysosomes was completely inhibited in AFTER
CHEMO-treated HCT116 cells (Figure 3G). Although, a
few days after BAF A1 was removed, a subpopulation of
cells with the high lysosomes activity appeared (Figure 3G).
Taken together these results demonstrate that a single pulse
BAF A1 treatment strongly blocks autophagy in doxo-treated
HCT116 cells. However, a few days later the process is reactivated, at least in a subpopulation of cancer cells.

staining disappeared in these cultures (Figure 4C, 4D). We
also found higher levels of p21, p-p53, H2A.X and p-S6
(Figure 4E) proteins and the increased production of SASP
factors: VEGF (Figure 4F) and IL-8 (Figure 4G) in these
cells in comparison to the controls.
Activation of H2A.X and p53, as well as an
increased IL-8 production, could be indicators of cell
death. Indeed, using a LDH release test we demonstrated
that HCT116 cells treated with the AFTER CHEMO+BAF
A1 protocol exhibited higher mortality than their
counterparts (Figure 5A). This effect was preceded by
the increase in a proportion of cells in the subG1 phase
(with DNA content < 2C) (Figure 5B). We corroborated
these data by detecting the cleaved PARP-1 using western
blotting. On the days 14 and 17 BAF A1-treated senescent
cells had the increased level of cleaved PARP-1 than their
counterparts (Figure 5C). This effect was not observed at
other time points.
It should be noted that BAF A1 treatment did not
affect the percentage of Ki67 positive cells (Figure 5E).
Ki67 was expressed not only in progeny, but also in some
polyploid cells (Figure 5D). We show that approximately
90% of CHEMO-treated HCT116 cells are in G0 phase
(Figure 5E). Senescent cells have been reported to
be blocked in G1 or G2 phase of the cell cycle [36].
Therefore, it was not clear whether the presence of Ki67
indicated cells, which were actively cycling or halted in
one of the cell cycle phases. We studied the effect of BAF
A1 treatment on clonogenic potential of individual doxotreated cells, by seeding them at low density (1000 cells
per well) on the 14th day and examining their ability to
form colonies three weeks later. AFTER CHEMO-treated
HCT116 produced significantly fewer colonies than
untreated cells (Figure 5F, 5G), although these colonies
were bigger (Figure 5F, 5H). There was no significant
difference in the numbers of colonies derived from
senescent cells and their counterparts treated with BAF A1
(Figure 5F, 5G). In contrast, BAF A1 treatment decreased
significantly the number of colonies derived from untreated
HCT116 (Figure 5F, 5G). We performed a detailed cell
cycle analysis using PI staining (Supplementary Figure S3)
to check, if BAF A1 affects predominantly other than
senescent cells. Indeed, upon BAF treatment the proportion
of diploid cells (with DNA content ≤ 4C) decreased(Figure
4B, Supplementary Figure S3B, S3C), whereas proportion
of polyploid cells, especially with DNA content > 8C,
increased (Supplementary Figure S3F, S3G, S3H, S3I).
To verify our observations, we treated human
glioblastoma LN18 cells with repeated cycles of
50 nM doxo. LN18 cells displayed the signs of senescence
already after the 1st cycle of the treatment and, in contrast
to HCT116 cells, started to proliferate afterwards.
Therefore, at the moment of BAF A1 treatment only
20% of CHEMO-treated LN18 cells showed features
of senescence, e.g. SA-β-gal positivity (Supplementary

Senescent cancer cells are resistant to BAF A1
treatment
We found that re-population of HCT116 cell
cultures was delayed up to 21 days after BAF A1 treatment
(p < 0.05, Figure 4A) and the number of diploid cells
entering G0/G1 phase (with 2C DNA content) was
reduced (p < 0.05, Figure 4B). To elucidate possible
mechanisms of BAF A1-induced early delay in repopulation of colon cancer cell cultures, we analyzed three
factors that may affect the cell number: senescence, cell
death and proliferation. Although, HCT116 cells treated
with the AFTER CHEMO + BAF A1 protocol exhibited
morphological alterations and hypertrophy for longer time
than their counterparts (day 21st, Figure 4C), SA-β-gal

autophagy inhibition) increased the level of p62 protein
and changed the proportion of LC3B II/I (Supplementary
Figure S4D), but the effects were not as prominent as
in HCT116 (Figure 3C). LN18 cells treated with the
AFTER CHEMO + BAF A1 protocol exhibited the

these cells showed the increased mortality (Supplementary
Figure S4G), reduced proportion of diploid cells with
2C DNA content and the enriched proportion of cells
with DNA content higher than 2C, but lower than 16C
(Supplementary Figure S5). A single pulse of BAF A1
produced more pronounced effects on re-population of
glioblastoma cultures (Supplementary Figure S4H) than
among colon cancer cells counterparts (Figure 4A). It

likely reflects the difference in the proportion of senescent
cells at the time of BAF A1 application.
Subsequently we studied if the effects of BAF A1
treatment depend on a mode of action of chemoterapeutic
agents that are used in colon cancer patients. HCT116 cells
treated with another senescence-inducing agent irinotecan
(irino) (Supplementary Figure S6A) were resistant to BAF
A1 treatment (Supplementary Figure S6B). In contrast, the

cells treated with oxaliplatin (oxa), which does not induce
senescence (Supplementary Figure S6A), showed moderate
sensitivity towards BAF A1 (Supplementary Figure S6B). We
observed that the cells exhibited strong induction of autophagy
upon irino treatment. The level of p62 was down-regulated,

whereas the LC3BII/ I ratio was increased (Supplementary
Figure S6C). The opposite effects were noticed after oxa
treatment (Supplementary Figure S6C). Taken together, these
data demonstrate that, in contrast to non-senescent cancer
cells, senescent cells are resistant to BAF A1 treatment.

A single pulse BAF A1 treatment transiently
affects some markers of cancer stem cells

A single pulse of BAF A1 in doxo-treated cancer
HCT116 cells reactivates their ability to form
tumors in NOD/SCID mice

Next we tested whether BAF A1 treatment affects the
expression of cancer stem cell markers and their functions.
As shown in the Figure 6A, CD24 was expressed on the
higher number of CHEMO-treated HCT116 cells than
their counterparts (p < 0.01). Following chemotherapy, the
percentage of CD24+ cells increased further till the 17th day
and subsequently decreased (Figure 6A). BAF A1 reduced
the number of CD24+ cells in a whole population (p = 0.057,
Figure 6A). Using multicolor staining with H33342 as a
ploidy discriminator, we showed that on the 21st day BAF A1
treatment resulted in the significant reduction in the number
of CD24+ cells among diploid cells (p < 0.05, Figure 6B) and
the cells with 16C DNA content (p < 0.001, Figure 6D).
Almost 100% of untreated HCT116 cells and
~80% of CHEMO-treated HCT116 expressed CD133
(Figure 6E) and CD44 antigens (Figure 6I). After doxo
removal the percentages of CD44+ and CD133+ cells
among diploid cells returned to high basal levels (Figure
6F, 6J), in contrast to their reduction among polyploid
cells (Figure 6G, 6H, 6K, 6L) We demonstrate that BAF
A1 treatment diminished the number of CD133+ cells (p <
0.001, Figure 6E) and CD44+ cells (p = 0.07, Figure 6I). This
short-term reduction in the number of CD133+ corresponded
mostly to diploid cells (p = 0.052, Figure 6F). As shown
in the Figure 7A, the higher number of untreated HCT116
cells exhibited ALDH activity than CHEMO-treated cells
(p < 0.01). BAF A1 treatment led to the significant reduction
in the percentage of cells with ALDH activity on the 17th
day (p < 0.001, Figure 7A), but only in polyploid cells
(Figure 7B). Furthermore, we demonstrated that a
subpopulation of cells excluding H33342 increased
significantly after drug treatment (p < 0.01), while BAF A1
had no effect (Figure 7C). On the day 17th BAF A1 treated
cells displayed the slight, but not significant decrease in the
proportion of cells excluding H33342, that were sensitive to
Verapamil (Figure 7D).
Last but not least, we studied whether BAF A1
treatment can affect spheroid-forming capacity of doxotreated cells. Therefore, on the 14th day we seeded
1000 cells per matrigel-filled well in 96-well plate and
examined them for spheroid formation three weeks later.
In contrast to non-senescent HCT116 cells, BAF A1 did
not change the numbers of spheroids derived from TIS
cells (Figure 7E, 7F). Spheroids formed by the doxotreated colon cancer cells were larger than those formed by
the untreated cells (Figure 7E, 7G). To summarize, these
data show that BAF A1 affects differently polyploid or
diploid cancer cells with stem cell-like properties.

To study whether BAF A1 treatment of doxotreated HCT116 cells affects their ability to form
tumors in vivo, they were implanted subcutaneously in
the back of 6-week old NOD/SCID mice. Cells were
treated with the AFTER CHEMO or AFTER CHEMO
+ BAF A1 protocol for 14 days. Subsequently, cells
were harvested, mixed with matrigel and 5 000 cells per
mice were injected. Tumors were allowed to grow for
10 weeks and tumor sizes were measured once per week.
Untreated HCT116 cells served as controls. Cells treated
with the AFTER CHEMO+ BAF A1 protocol started to
form tumors four weeks earlier than their counterparts
and tumors developed in 5 per 7 animals. Tumor grew
only in 1 out of 7 animals inoculated with the AFTER
CHEMO-treated cells (Figure 8A, 8B). As a result, at
the end point the AFTER CHEMO+ BAF A1-treated
cells produced bigger tumors in comparison to controls
(p < 0.05, Figure 8B). Morphological analysis revealed
that senescent HCT116-derived tumors displayed higher
density of collagen fibers and better vascularization than
their counterparts as evidenced by hemotoxylin/eosin
staining (Figure 8C).
To elucidate the mechanism of facilitated tumor
growth in NOD/SCID mice, we determined the production
of human VEGF in sera of tumor-bearing mice. Cells
treated with the AFTER CHEMO + BAF A1 protocol
secreted more VEGF in vitro that their counterparts
(Figure 4A). VEGF is a major pro-angiogenic factor,
which supports endothelial cell proliferation and tumor
neoangiogenesis [37]. Additionally, this growth factor
was shown to assist both endothelial [38] and tumor cells
to escape senescence [39, 40]. Here, we demonstrate that
the levels of VEGF, estimated by ELISA (specific for
human protein) were higher in sera of mice injected with
BAF A1-treated senescent cells than in sera of animals
injected with their counterparts (Figure 8D). To check,
whether VEGF released by cancer cells might affect
endothelial cell proliferation, we incubated HUVEC cells
with conditioned media harvested from HCT116 cells
treated with the AFTER CHEMO + BAF A1 protocol
in the presence of an isotypic or VEGF-neutralizing
antibody (NAbs-VEGF). Co-incubation with NAbs-VEGF
decreased proliferation of HUVEC (Figure 8E). Taken
together, these data suggest that a pulse BAF A1 treatment
increases tumorigenic potential of senescent HCT116 and,
consequently, the efficiency of tumor formation in NOD/
SCID animals.

doxorubicin cycles to obtain more stable and homogenous
population of senescent cells [48] and to mimic processes
occurring in cancer patients subjected to repeated
chemotherapy cycles over long time. We demonstrate
that in response to the treatment, a majority of HCT116
cells showed features of senescence exemplified by flatten
morphology and increased size, growth arrest, polyploidy,
augmented SA-β-Gal and SASP. After doxorubicin
removal, the number of cells significantly increased, which
was associated with atypical divisions of the polyploid

cells. Previously, we had showed an indirect evidence that
some doxorubicin-treated HCT116 cells can give rise to
progeny [18, 41]. Rajaraman and coworkers proposed that
polyploid cells undergo neosis, an amitotic type of cell
division, followed by asymmetric intracellular cytokinesis
that produces small cells with stem-cell-like characteristics
[16, 19, 49]. Generation of small cells (budding) was
described in tumor cell lines of different tissue origins
[17, 43, 50]. Accumulation of the nuclear markers of

polyploid cells was also reported [17, 51]. Accordingly,
we demonstrate that senescent HCT116 cells possess
several properties of cancer stem cells, namely:
elevated NANOG expression, increased Hoechst 33342
exclusion, increased CD24 expression, an ability to
divide asymmetrically, clonogenic and spheroid-forming
potential. Furthermore, using Ki67 staining and Dil
retention assay, we show that during doxo administration,

a majority of HCT116 cells are maintained in G0 phase.
Accordingly, Zhang and coworkers showed that polyploid
cancer cells express normal and cancer stem cell markers,
divide asymmetrically and cycle slowly [42]. Erenpreisa’s
group reported that polyploid cells expressing stemness
(OCT4, SOX2, NANOG) and senescence (p16) markers
in samples from tumors, that were non-responsive to
neoadjuvant chemotherapy, were Ki67 and CD44 positive

[52]. In contrast, Zhang and colleagues documented that
SA-β-Gal-negative polyploid cancer cells can divide by
budding and give rise to cancer stem cells [43].
To clarify whether polyploid cells or their progeny
exhibit cancer stem cell-like properties, we analyzed
the numbers of CD24, CD44 and CD133 positive cells,
using H33342 staining as a ploidy discriminator. We show
that upon doxo treatment the percentage of CD24+ cells
increased, especially among polyploid cells. Likewise,
the numbers of CD133+ and CD44+ cells decreased.
Interestingly, after doxo removal the percentages of CD44+
and CD133+ cells among diploid cells returned to high
basal levels, in contrast to their reduction among polyploid
cells. These data suggest that doxo-treated colon cancer
cells exhibit dynamic changes in CD24, CD133 and
CD44 antigen presentation, which may have the impact
on e.g. the efficacy of CSC-targeted immunotherapy. The
distribution of CD44+/CD24+ cells in colorectal cancer
is under dispute, although it has been demonstrated that
between 50 and 68% of patients suffering from colorectal
cancers have high level of CD24+ cells [53]. Recent
studies demonstrated that CD44+/CD24+ colorectal
cancer cells show greater clonogenic potential in vitro
and tumor initiation in vivo [54]. Du et al. indicated that
the HCT116 cells with the high expression of CD44 and
CD133 showed tumor-initiating capability [55]. On the
other hand, it was reported that both CD133+ and CD133subpopulations formed colonospheres in in vitro cultures
and were capable of long-term tumorigenesis in NOD/
SCID mice. However, during the metastatic transition,
CD133+ cells might give rise to the more aggressive
CD133- subset [56]. Therefore, our results are in line with
those notions pointing to variability in CSC phenotypes,
potential of non-CSCs to switch to CSC-like cells and the
existence of dynamic balance of CSCs [21]. Altogether,
we conclude that doxo-induced senescent cells display a
specific phenotype, being a mixture of cancer stem-like
and differentiated cell features. Nonetheless, links between
senescence and stemness require further elucidation at a
single cell level.

cells exposed to a single pulse of BAF A1 (a specific
inhibitor of lysosomal acidification, similar to HCQ and
used widely as an autophagy inhibitor), reduced their
proliferation at early stages. Importantly, the effect was
associated with the decrease in the number of diploid
cells, but the augmented numbers of polyploid ones.
Nonetheless, at later stages of experiment, the proliferation
rate increased and autophagy was re-activated, at least
in a subpopulation of TIS cells. The effects of a single
pulse of BAF A1 on re-population of doxo-treated
glioblastoma LN18 cultures were more pronounced than
in colon cancer cells, and were correlated with the lower
proportion of TIS cells at the time of BAF A1 application.
Additionally, we demonstrate that BAF A1 impaired
colony- and spheroid-formation in the control, but not
in TIS cells. We hypothesized that some of polyploid
cells with re-activated autophagy produce progeny.
Accordingly, autophagy/lysosomal pathway was reported
to participate in chromatin processing in senescent cells
[62] and segregation of functional subnuclei during their
amitotic divisions [17].
Consistently, treatments with two drugs that are
used in colon cancer patients – irinotecan (a senescenceinducing agent) and oxaliplatin (which does not activate
senescence) produced different effects. It should be noted
that doxorubicin and irinotecan activate senescence and
autophagy as well. Therefore, we proposed that elevated
autophagy in senescent cancer cells contributes to their
high resistance to BAF A1 treatment. Interestingly,
TIS lymphomas, unlike senescence models that lack a
strong SASP response, were more sensitive to blockade
of glucose utilization or autophagy, which led to their
selective elimination through caspase-12- and caspase-3mediated endoplasmic-reticulum-related apoptosis [63].
Polyploid cells were shown to have distinct advantage
over diploid cancer cells in dealing with stress and
reproduction [64].
Moreover, we demonstrate that BAF A1-treated
TIS HCT116 cells, when injected to NOD/SCID mice,
form tumors more effectively than TIS HCT116 cells. We
hypothesize that it could be due to increased proliferation
of a subpopulation of HCT116 cells that re-activated
autophagy after a pulse of BAF A1 treatment and/or
to some factors released by BAF A1-treated senescent
colon cancer cells that might affect their interactions with
stroma. Using ELISA specific for human proteins, we
found significantly more VEGF in sera of mice injected
with BAF-A1 treated senescent cells than in sera of
animals inoculated with their counterparts. BAF A1
treatment also up-regulated VEGF secretion by senescent
cells in vitro. We show that proliferation of HUVEC cells
treated with conditioned media harvested from BAF A1treated TIS HCT116 was enhanced, whereas treatment
with a neutralizing antibody NAbs-VEGF decreased their
proliferation. VEGF is a key regulator of angiogenesis [37]

Senescent cells are resistant to autophagy
inhibition
Non-dividing cells cannot redistribute and eliminate
damaged organelles, proteins or aggregates through cell
division [25], which implies the importance of autophagy
for senescent cells [57]. This process was demonstrated
to promote colon cancer cell survival by preventing cell
death, induced by radio- and chemotherapy [58–61]. The
results of clinical studies combining autophagy inhibitor
HCQ with chemotherapy have been already published
[33], leaving several issues unclear, in particular, the
impact of TIS on the acquired drug resistance. Here,
we show that doxo-treated colon cancer HCT116

and is crucial for angiogenic switch during early stages of
tumorigenesis [65]. VEGF is produced by normal senescent
fibroblasts and enhances angiogenesis in tumors [66].
Importantly, VEGF may induce escape from senescence
in endothelial cells [38] as well in colorectal cancer [39]
and glioblastoma [40]. Therefore, our data suggest that TIS
cancer cells are more resistant to BAF A1 treatment than
untreated ones. The single pulse autophagy inhibition in
senescent HCT116 cells might accelerate tumor growth in
mice through SASP-mediated mechanism.

SA-β-gal is not a specific senescence marker
We show that despite being enlarged and growth
arrested, the senescent HCT116 cells treated with BAF
A1 almost completely lost SA-β-gal staining. It raises a
question, which markers should be used to characterize
senescence. SA-β-gal activity is considered a major
senescent marker [3, 67, 68] and the first choice in in
vivo studies [13, 14, 47]. The actual involvement of this
enzyme in the senescence response has not been directly
demonstrated [69, 70]. SA-β-gal staining appears also in
dense cell cultures that are not senescent. Therefore, we
propose that measurement of DNA content that is directly
related to cellular hypertrophy [7] could be more reliable
marker of senescence than SA-β-gal activity. In the
present study, we employed two methods to measure DNA
content, both in suspension and in situ. Staining with Ruby
[14] or vital H33342 as ploidy discriminators, allows to
connect the expression of various extra- and intracellular
proteins with ploidy status in alive cells by means of
flow cytometry. In turn, quantification of nuclei areas
[43] and their co-localization with proteins of interest in
microscopic images enables to study polyploid cells in
specimen. Detection of triploidy in the DNA histogram of
diagnostic biopsy was proposed to be useful for decision
on the expediency of chemotherapy [52].
In conclusion, we demonstrate that senescent
cancer cells that appear after chemiotherapeutics exhibit
certain features of cancer stem cells and may persist in a
dormant state before re-establishing cancer after ending
chemotherapy. Importantly, a pulse autophagy inhibition
by BAF A1 in senescent cells may reactivate their tumorforming capacities and facilitate tumor growth through
SASP-mediated mechanism. Therefore, further detailed
studies of mechanisms underlying TIS-related cancer
maintenance and re-population are urgently needed.

To induce senescence cancer cells were seeded at a
density of 10 000/cm2 24 hours before chemotherapeutics
treatment. Next, HCT116 cells were cultured in the
presence of 100 nM doxorubicin (doxo), 5 μM oxaliplatin
(oxa) or 2.5 μM irinotecan (irino). LN18 cells were cultured
in the presence of 50 nM doxo. This procedure was
repeated three times (CHEMO protocol). Afterwards, cells
were cultured in drug-free medium for two weeks. Medium
was changed every four days (AFTER CHEMO protocol).
To inhibit autophagy in senescent cells, HCT116
or LN18 cells treated with the CHEMO protocol were

Human umbilical vein endothelial cells EA.hy926
was kindly provided by Dr. Antoni Wrzosek (Nencki
Institute of Experimental Biology, Warsaw, Poland).
Cells were grown under standard conditions (37°C,
5% CO2) in low glucose (1 mg/ml) Dulbecco’s
Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) supplemented with
10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/mL of penicillin,
100 µg/mL of streptomycin, and 25 µg/mL of amphotericin
B (Antibiotic-Antimycotic).

After the 3rd doxo cycle, adherent, alive cells were
re-plated into 6-well plates at a density of 1000 cells per
well and cultured for additional 21 days. Medium was
changed every seven days. Afterwards, the colonies were
fixed and stained in a mixture of methanol and 0,5%
crystal violet (1:1) for 60 minutes. Cells were rinsed with
water, dried at RT, and clones were counted. Images of the
colonies (corresponding to single wells of the multi-well
dishes) were normalized by division to their counterparts
containing only background (estimated as the local
maximum of the polynomial fit). Colonies were segmented
from the corrected images using the images with Otsu
thresholding (two classes, variance criterion). Clustered
(touching) colonies were separated using Euclidean
distance transform, followed by watershed. The colonies
were counted and their equivalent radii estimated from the
respective areas. All image processing operations were
executed with CellProfiler 2.1. Cell viability were assessed
using Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release test according
to the vendor’s instructions. The results were normalized
to the total cell number.

Western blotting
Adherent, alive cells were harvested into Laemmli
SDS sample lysis buffer, sonicated and centrifuged at
10  000 × g for 10 min. Concentration of proteins was
estimated by the BCA method; 100 mM DTT and 0.01%
bromphenol was added to lysates before separation by
SDS-PAGE (8, 12 and 15% gels were used). Total protein
concentrations were determined using bicinchoninic acid
(BCA) protein assay kit, according to manufacturer’s
instruction.The same protein amount (7.5 to 50 μg) was
loaded into each well. Membranes were blocked in 5%
non-fat milk dissolved in TBS containing 0.1% Tween-20
for 1 hour at room temperature (RT). Then, membranes
were probed overnight at 4°C with antibodies specific
for: p53, H2A.X and p21Cip1 (1:500 in TBS/ 5% milk),
PARP-1, p62 and γ-H2AX (1:1 000 in TBS/ 5% milk),
p-p53 (Ser15) (1:500 in TBS/ 5% BSA), p-S6 (1:1 000
in TBS/ 5% BSA), LC3B (1:5 000 in TBS/ 5% BSA).
GAPDH (1:30 000 in TBS/ 5% BSA) was used as a
loading control. Then proteins were detected using
appropriate secondary HRP-conjugated antibodies (1:10
000 in TBS/5% milk) and ECL reagents as recommended
by manufacturer.

Matrigel assay
To test whether senescent cells can form
tumorospheres, after the 3rd doxo cycle, alive, adherent
HCT116 cells were replated into 96-well plates fulfilled
with 50 µl of Matrigel Matrix (Growth Factor Reduced).
Matrigel was polymerized at least for 30 minutes in 37°C
before seeding. Cells were seeded at a density of 1 000 cells
per well and cultured for additional 21 days. Medium was
changed every seven days. Images of the spheres were taken
weekly using inverted Olympus DP73 microscope, working
in transmitted light mode. Images of the spheres were
corrected for background (polynomial fit). The corrected
images were processed with uniform filter (11 × 11 pixels)
and subjected to gray-scale opening (radius 17 pixels). The
sphere candidates were segmented with Otsu thresholding
and the objects with circularity below 0.45 rejected from
further analysis. The areas corresponding to the segmented
spheres were quantified and expressed as radii of equivalent
discs. All image processing operations were implemented
using CellProfiler 2.1.

Detection of senescence-associated
β-galactosidase (SA-β-Gal)
SA-β-Gal activity was detected according to
modified Dimri et al. [68]. Briefly, adherent, alive cells
were trypsinized, fixed with 2% formaldehyde, 0.2%
glutaraldehyde in PBS, washed, cytospined and exposed
overnight at 37ºC to a solution containing 1 mg/ml
5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-b-D-galactopyranoside, 5 mM

At least 10 000 events were analyzed for each sample. The

manually at the FWHM of the respective peaks of the and
used consistently throughout the analysis.

assay buffer were stained with 7-AAD (4 μM) for viability
assessment. Flow cytometry was performed using a BD
LSRFortessa instrument equipped with a 488-nm argon
laser. Aldefluor fluorescence was detected using the green
fluorescence channel (530/15 nm). 7-AAD fluorescence
was detected using the orange fluorescence channel
(585/21 nm). Data for 30 000 cells was collected and
analyzed using BD FACSDiva 6.2 software.

Side population (SP) evaluation

Fluorescent staining of lysosomes

Alive, adherent cells were trypsinized, washed twice
in PBS and then re-suspended at 106 cells/ml in PBS, then
incubated at 37°C with 5 μg/ml Hoechst 33342 (H33342).
For the inhibitor control, 50 μM Verapamil was added
5 minutes prior to H33342. Cells were incubated for
90 minutes at 37°C with constant mixing. Staining was
halted by rinsing in ice-cold PBS. Prior to measurement
cells were stained with PI (4 μM) for viability assessment.
Cells were analyzed on the BD LSRFortessa flow
cytometer. Cells were excited with a UV laser (355 nm,
20 mW). The emission was detected through 450/50 nm
BP (“Hoechst Blue”) and 530/30 BP with dichroic 505 LP
(“Hoechst Red”) filters. All data were collected in linear
mode and analyzed using BD FACSDiva 6.2 software. Cells
were displayed on dot plots gated on live cells (PI negative)
and viewed in a Hoechst Blue versus Hoechst Red dot plot
to visualize the SP. The SP gate was determined by the use
of the 50 μM Verapamil inhibitor-treated cells. Data for 30
000 cells was collected and analyzed.

Living cells were incubated with 1 μM LysoTracker®
Red DND-99 directly added to the culture medium for
30 minutes at 37°C. Nuclei were stained with the vital
H33342 at 1 µg/ml for 5 minutes at 37°C and analysed
using fluorescent Nikon Eclipse 50i microscope, CCD
Evolutions VF camera (MediaCybernetics) and the ImagePro Plus 6.0 software. Afterwards, cells were trypsinized,
washed with PBS and immediately measured using a BD
FACS Calibur and the CellQuestPro 6.0 software. Results
are presented as percentage of control mean fluorescence
in channel FL2; 10 000 events were analyzed for each
sample.

Fluorescent staining with Dil to determine slowcycling cells
Living cells were incubated with Dil directly added
in the culture medium at 37°C at 1 μg/ ml for 30 minutes.
For flow cytometry analysis cells were stained on the
day 1st and at the given time points were trypsinized,
washed with PBS and immediately measured using a BD
FACS Calibur and the CellQuestPro 6.0 software. Results
are presented as percent of control mean fluorescence
in channel FL2. 10 000 events were analyzed for each
sample. For spheroid-forming analysis cells were stained
on the day 14th and immediately seed into matrigel.

Flow cytometry analysis of cancer stem cell
markers
Cells labeled with H33342 for SP were probed with
specific fluorochrome-conjugated antibodies. Briefly,
1 × 105 cells were incu­bated with 100 μl of PBS containing
0.1 μg of antibodies: APC-conjugated anti-CD133, FITCconjugated anti-CD24 and AlexaFluor 700-conjugated
anti-CD44 antibodies for 30 minutes on ice. Labeled
cells were re-suspended in PBS and stained with PI
(4 μM) for viability assessment. Isotypic IgGs served as
a negative control. Flow cytometry was performed using
a BD LSRFortessa instrument. Signal excited with 488
nm laser (50 mW): FITC and PI were detected in 530/30
and 575/26 BPs respectively; with 640 nm laser (40 mW):
APC and AlexaFluor 700 in 670/14 and 730/45 BPs. Data
for 30 000 cells was collected and analyzed using BD
FACSDiva 6.2 software.

Immunofluorescent staining
Cells grown on chamber slides were fixed with
4% formaldehyde for 10 minutes, washed in PBS,
permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS for
20 minutes and blocked for 60 minutes in PBS with 5%
goat serum and 0.1% Triton X-100. Afterwards, cells were
incubated with the primary antibodies at 1:100 (1:500
for LC3B) in the blocking solution at 4°C overnight in
humidified chamber. After that samples were washed with
PBS and incubated with secondary antibodies conjugated
with AlexaFluor 488 or AlexaFluor 555 diluted 1:200 in PBS
for two hours in RT in humidified chamber. Then the slides
were stained for 5 minutes with H33342 (1 μg/ml in PBS) and
mounted with Fluorescent Mounting Medium. In the control
experiments, the steps with primary antibodies were omitted.
Slides were analyzed using a fluorescent Leica DM4000B.
Images were captured using Image Pro-Plus 5.0 software.

Aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) activity
Cells labeled with H33342 were resuspended at 106
cells per milliliter in Aldefluor assay buffer with BODIPYaminoacetaldehyde (BAAA) at a concentration of 1.5 μM
for 30 min at 37°C. For the inhibitor control, 50 μmol/l
of the specific ALDH inhibitor diethylaminobenzaldehyde
(DEAB) was added. After washing with cells Aldefluor

Detection of Ki67+ cells and quantification of
lysosomal activity with image cytometry

Long-term time-lapse
Cells were seeded in 6-well plate and starting
on the day 17th of AFTER CHEMO protocol they
were recorded for 60 hours. Pictures were taken every
10 minutes using time-lapse Leica AF7000 microscopy
in DIC Nomarski contrast with 10 × objective, using
microscope equipped with DFC350 FX camera (Leica,
Mannheim, Germany), and environmental chamber
(Pecon, Erbach, Germany).

Series of optical sections were registered using
DSD2 spinning disc confocal system (Leica/Andor)
equipped with a 20× oil immersion objective (NA =
1.4), sCMOS camera (Andor Zyla 5.5) and 200W metal
halide light source (Andor AMH-200-FS6). Fluorescence
of H33342 (nuclei) was excited in 370–410 nm range
and detected in 430–475 nm range. Fluorescence of
AlexaFluor 488 (Ki67) was excited in 469–497 nm
range and detected in 500-550 nm range. Fluorescence of
LysoTracker® Red DND-99 was excited in 545–560 nm
range and detected in 565–600 nm range. The fluorescence
signal digitized with 12 bit precision and the image
acquisition parameters (time, gain) were set so as to fill
65 % the dynamic range. Single optical section comprised
2124 × 1171 pixels (corresponding to 0.1 × 0.1 μm each)
and the spacing between the sections was 0.7 μm. The
3D images (H33342, AlexaFluor 488, LysoTracker® Red
DND-99) were converted to 2D, with average z-projection,
and used in further processing steps, implemented with
CellProfiler (http://cellprofiler.org/). The H33342 images
were subjected to average filtering (9 × 9 kernel) and
used to calculate the background (local minima within
75 × 75 pixel blocks). Following background subtraction
the candidate nuclei were segmented with Otsu
thresholding (two classes, weighted variance criterion).
The identified regions were split with Euclidean distance
transform followed by watersheding (the minimum
object distance of 45 pixels). The regions which were
characterized by circularity < 0.35 or area < 1000 pixels
were excluded from further analysis. 2D images of Ki67
were corrected with background subtraction (local minima
within 90 × 90 pixel blocks) and processed with tophat
filter (25 × 25 pixels). Regions of high Ki67 fluorescence
intensity were identified with background thresholding,
followed by watersheding (the minimum object distance
of 7 pixels). These Ki67-positive regions were assigned
to corresponding nuclear masks. The nuclei containing
one or more such regions were regarded as Ki67-positive,
otherwise as negative. 2D images of LysoTracker® Red
DND-99 were corrected with background subtraction
(local minima within 90 × 90 pixel blocks) and
processed with tophat filter (7 × 7 pixels). Regions of
high LysoTracker® Red DND-99 fluorescence intensity
(lysosomes and their clusters) were identified with
constrained Otsu thresholding followed by watersheding.
The groups of lysosome masks were assigned to single
cells with Voronoi tessellation. The fluorescence intensity
of lysosomes was then quantified on the cell-by-cell basis
from the background-corrected LysoTracker® Red DND99 images. The cells were assigned to classes according
to the number (none, low, high) and average fluorescence
intensity (0, low, high) of the corresponding lysosomes.

Inoculation of tumor cells and in vivo assessment
of tumor growth
To determine an ability of senescent cells to
form tumors, senescent HCT116 (N = 7) and BAF A1treated senescent HCT116 cells (N = 7) were injected
subcutaneously into 6-week old female NOD.CB17Prkdc s c i d /NCrHsd mice (Harlan Laboratories S.r.l.,
Italy). Untreated HCT116 (N = 6) were used as a control.
Alive, adherent cells were harvested on the day 14th.
Each subcutaneous injection consisted of 5 × 103 cells
together with 50 μL of Matrigel Matrix mixed with 50 μL
of PBS. The mice were kept in a specific pathogen-free
environment and checked for tumor development during 2
months. Once a week the animals were weighed and tumor
sizes were documented. Tumor volumes were determined
by means of caliper and calculated using the following
formula: V = D × d2 × 0.5 (V is the tumor volume, D is the
biggest dimension; d is the smallest dimension). The mice
were then euthanized by isoflurane inhalation followed
by cervical dislocation. The tumors were excised, fixed
in 10% formalin overnight and subjected to routine
histological hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining.
The study was approved by the Local Ethics Committee
for Animal Experimentation at the Nencki Institute of
Experimental Biology.

Measurement of HUVEC proliferation
Proliferation of HUVECs was measured in cells
cultured in 96-well plates using BrdU incorporation assay
according to vendor’s protocol. To measure angiogenic
properties of HCT116, 1.5 × 103 HUVECs were seeded
in 100 μl of complete DMEM medium. Medium was
replaced with incomplete DMEM medium (without FBS)
24 hrs later. After 24 hrs of starvation HUVEC cells were
treated with the mixture of 50 μl of incomplete DMEM
medium and 50 μl of conditioned medium collected
from BAF A1-treated senescent HCT116 cells on the day
17th. Media were preincubated with VEGF-neutralizing
antibodies or istotype control antibodies for 30 minutes,
at 37°C, with mixing. BrdU incorporation assay was
performed after 48 hours.
