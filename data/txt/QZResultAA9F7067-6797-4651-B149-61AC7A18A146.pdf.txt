ABSTRACT
Our previous studies have demonstrated that sorafenib can promote the
dissemination of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) through downregulation of HTATIP2,
a suppressor of tumor growth and metastasis that is associated with inhibition of
angiogenesis. Here, we investigated the predictive values of the HTATIP2 level
and microvessel density (MVD) with or without sorafenib administration for HCC.
Three independent cohorts were included. Using tissue microarray, we assessed the
relationship between HTATIP2 expression/MVD and overall survival. The results
showed that high HTATIP2 expression and a low MVD value were independent
protective prognostic factors after curative HCC resection (297 cases/cohort 1);
however, both parameters were converted to independent negative prognostic
indicators for patients with postsurgical sorafenib treatment (69/143 cases/cohort
2; P<0.05 for all). This same relationship was observed in patients that received
sorafenib treatment for advanced HCC (83 cases/cohort 3; efficacy measures and
survival analyses, P<0.05 for all). Moreover, the combination of HTATIP2 and MVD
had better power to predict patient death and disease recurrence (P<0.001 for both).
We conclude that the combination of HTATIP2 and MVD predicts the converse survival
of HCC with or without sorafenib intervention. Our findings can assist in the selection
of candidates for personalized treatment with sorafenib.

INTRODUCTION

Sorafenib, a receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor (RTKI) that
targets both tumor and endothelial cells, has improved
the prognosis for patients with advanced HCC[3, 4].
Recently, the use of sorafenib has been investigated for the
prevention of postsurgical recurrence and metastasis[5].
Despite endeavors to improve the efficacy of sorafenib,
the survival benefit of this agent was found to be only a
few months, probably due to the lack of effective tools
that can assist in patient selection and predict individual
outcomes.

Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the sixth most
prevalent cancer globally and the third most common
cause of cancer-related death[1]. The overall survival
(OS) rate remains poor, although progress has been made
recently[2]. Surgical resection of early-stage HCC is
the most widely adopted therapy, and a 5-year survival
of ~50% can be achieved[2]; however, the rate of
postoperative recurrence or metastasis still remains high.

Cumulative studies have provided evidence and
insight that sorafenib and another RTKI, sunitinib, can
accelerate the spread of cancer in certain situations[6-9],
suggesting that only some patients may benefit from these
agents. Our previous studies have also demonstrated
that sorafenib promotes invasiveness and metastasis of
HCC through downregulation of HIV-1 Tat interactive
protein 2 (HTATIP2) using animal tumor models[10, 11];
nonetheless, the clinical significance of the latter finding
has not been fully elucidated. HTATIP2 plays an important
role in the suppression of hepatocarcinoma growth and
metastasis[12, 13], and may be associated with inhibition
of angiogenesis[14]; however, the correlation between
HTATIP2 expression and microvessel density (MVD)
remains unclear. Moreover, the function of HTATIP2 as
a prognostic factor after curative resection of HCC needs
to be clarified.
Herein, we aimed to investigate the prognostic
and/or predictive characteristics of HTATIP2 and MVD,
separately and combinatorially, for survival of HCC
patients in the presence and absence of sorafenib.

although, sporadic positive staining on them was also
observed (Figure 1A, B, E, F; supplemental Figure S1A

of the patients with strong positive HTATIP2 staining
exhibited a relatively low MVD and vice versa. The

Correlations between HTATIP2 expression/
microvessel density and clinicopathological
features.

We used the median value of HTATIP2 density or MVD as
the cutoff points for the definition of the subgroups (highversus low-risk groups)[10, 16], and these values were as
follows: 0.0457/cohort 1, 0.0594/cohort 2, and 0.0626/
cohort 3 for HTATIP2 and 0.0877/cohort 1, 0.0736/cohort
2, and 0.0756/cohort 3 for MVD. The HTATIP2 density
was negatively correlated with MVD remarkably in the
three cohorts (r=–0.279, P<0.001 for cohort 1; r=–0.231,
P=0.006 for cohort 2; and r=–0.350, P=0.001 for cohort
3; Figure 1 and Figure S1).

As shown in Table 2 of cohort 1, patients with a low
intratumoral HTATIP2 expression or a high MVD were
prone to exhibit large tumor size, high serum α-fetoprotein
concentration, high tumor-node-metastasis (TNM) stage
(borderline significance for HTATIP2), and the presence

These correlations were verified in Supplemental Table S1
of cohort 2, which comprised 69 sorafenib-administered
cases as well as 74 sorafenib non-administered cases. No

with RFS (Table 3). The median OS and RFS times were
34.1 months and 31.0 months, respectively, for patients
with high HTATIP2 density and were significantly longer
than that for patients with low HTATIP2 density (23.5
months and 13.0 months, respectively; P<0.001 for both;
Figure 2A and B). By contrast, patients with a high MVD
had a poor OS and RFS (P<0.001 for both; Figure 2C and
D; Table 3). However, in univariate analysis of factors
for 69 sorafenib-administered patients in cohort 2, almost
none of these clinicopathological features were related
to OS and RFS, except that α-fetoprotein was associated
with OS (Supplemental Table S2). In contrast to cohort 1,
patients with high HTATIP2 expression or a low MVD had
an even worse OS (P<0.001 and P=0.001, respectively)
and RFS (P=0.001 and P=0.002, respectively) than those
with low HTATIP2 expression or high MVD (Figure 3A–

respectively; Figure S2A and B). Next, we classified
cohort 2 into two subgroups with either high or low
expression of HTATIP2 according to the HTATIP2
density. The analyses showed that sorafenib did not impact
patient outcome in the HTATIP2 high-expression group
(OS, P=0.191 and RFS, P=0.617; Figure S2C and D);
however, in the HTATIP2 low-expression group OS and
RFS were dramatically prolonged (P<0.001 and P=0.001,
respectively; Figure S2E and F).
Risk factors identified by univariate analysis of
cohorts 1 and 2 were pooled into a multivariate Cox

proportional hazards analysis (Table 3; Table S2). Both
high HTATIP2 expression and low MVD were independent
protective factors of OS (hazard ratio [HR]=0.841,
P=0.001 and HR=4.084, P<0.001, respectively) and of
RFS (HR=0.676, P=0.039 and HR=2.361, P <0.001,
respectively) for cohort 1. Unexpectedly, both biomarkers
were independent risk factors of OS (HR=4.567,
P=0.001 and HR=0.254, P=0.003, respectively) and
of RFS (HR=4.165, P<0.001 and HR=0.444, P=0.034,
respectively) for sorafenib-administered patients in cohort
2.

three groups for further analyses (see Results for details). (A and B) High HTATIP2 and (C and D) low MVD were associated with poor OS
and PFS. (E and F) The combination of high HTATIP2 and low MVD suggested the shortest OS and earliest disease progression.

expression and MVD were included, and their predictive
values were studied by ROC analysis (see Supplemental
Materials and Methods for details). HTATIP2 expression,
MVD, and the combination of both parameters precisely
predicted death and recurrence for both cohorts (P<0.05
for all), and the predictive value of the combinatorial
group was the best among all the adopted factors (Figure
S3). The area under the curve of this combination was
0.730/0.848 for death and 0.690/0.754 for recurrence
in cohort 1/sorafenib-administered patients of cohort 2
(P<0.001 for all), respectively, and was greater than other
factors (Tables S3 and S4).

Patients (cohort 1 and 69 sorafenib-administered
patients in cohort 2) were first categorized into three
groups according to their HTATIP2 density and MVD:
group I, high HTATIP2 and low MVD; group II, high
HTATIP2 and high MVD as well as low HTATIP2 and
low MVD; and group III, low HTATIP2 and high MVD.
When performing the ROC analysis, group II was further
divided into two groups with both high/low levels of the
two biomarkers. The prognostic analysis of both cohorts
showed significant differences in both OS and RFS among
the three groups (P<0.001 for all; Table 3; Table S2). The
cumulative OS and RFS rates of group I were the best
for cohort 1 (Figure 2E and F) but were the worst for
sorafenib-administered patients of cohort 2 (Figure 3E and
F); the converse case was observed for group III.

(both P=0.001 for OS and both P<0.001 for PFS; Figure
4A–D). The median OS and PFS were >13.0 and 8.6
months for the low-HTATIP2 group, but were only 6.2
and 4.0 months for the high-HTATIP2 group, respectively.
In addition, the median OS and PFS were 13.1 and 8.3
months for the high MVD group, but were only 5.8 and
4.0 months for the low-MVD group, respectively. The
combination of high HTATIP2 and low MVD predicted
the worst OS and PFS (P<0.001 for both; Figure 4E
and F). The disease-control rate was 43.4% for the lowHTATIP2 group and 28.9% for the high-HTATIP2 group
(P=0.004). The disease-control rate was 42.2% for the
high-MVD group and 30.1% for the low-MVD group
(P=0.037; Table S5).

from previously described experimental research and
with clinical findings from other tumor types[18, 23].
Here, we also described a negative correlation between
HTATIP2 expression and MVD, implying that the putative
antiangiogenic property plays a crucial role in the tumor
inhibitory effects of HTATIP2[14, 22]. Consequently, the
combination of high HTATIP2 expression and low MVD
may predict the best survival after surgery.
Nevertheless, our results further showed that the
combination of high HTATIP2 and low MVD predicted
the worst survival when patients were adjunctively
treated with sorafenib. Randomized trials of sorafenib
have shown survival benefits for individuals with various
tumors[3, 25] (ClinicalTrials.gov), although prometastatic
side effects have also been observed[26]. Ebos et al. and
Paez-Ribes et al. first reported the adverse results of
antiangiogenic therapy in their experimental studies[6, 7].
Investigations of the underlying mechanism have focused
on the host environment, tumor microenvironment, and
tumor cells[27-29]. Among them, tumor hypoxia and
impairment of vascular integrity were considered to
be the two most important factors contributing to the
prometastatic effects of antiangiogenic therapy[7, 9].
For example, we previously report that tumor-associated
macrophages are recruited by sorafenib and contribute to
the malignancy of HCC in association with hypoxia[30];
however, we have not detected predictive value of tumorassociated macrophages for sorafenib in our preliminary
investigations (data not shown). In another previous study,
we found that sorafenib directly downregulated HTATIP2
in tumor cells and provoked liver micrometastases[10].
This was the first report showing that sorafenib directly
promoted invasiveness of HCC cells, and we demonstrated
its clinical significance in the present study. Considering
the critical role of HTATIP2 in the suppression of HCC
growth and metastasis and the inhibition of proangiogenic
capability of the tumor cells, we speculated that the
invasive and metastatic potential of residual tumor cells
with high HTATIP2 expression would be stimulated
after downregulation of HTATIP2 expression following
sorafenib treatment. Interestingly, the time to relapse/
progression and overall survival were substantially
shortened. Conceivably, in patients with high HTATIP2
expression, the efficacy of sorafenib application would not
be expected, suggesting that patients with lower HTATIP2
expression are better candidates for sorafenib therapy.
Intriguingly, in the present study, in sorafenibtreated patients, we also found a reverse good prognosis
for those with high tumor MVD. On the one hand, the
cause may be that high MVD significantly correlates
with low HTATIP2 density and that the low HTATIP2
expression enhanced the patients’ sensitivity to sorafenib.
On the other hand, patients with high MVD were more
likely to have a higher sensitivity to antiangiogenic agents,
such as sorafenib. We presume that this relationship was a
result of the combined efficacy of both factors.

DISCUSSION
In the present study, we found that tumor MVD was
negatively correlated with the expression of HTATIP2. In
contrast to MVD, high HTATIP2 expression in HCC was
an independent protective prognostic factor after curative
resection and was associated with small tumor size, a
lower rate of intrahepatic metastasis and microvascular
invasion, and much better prognosis. However, both high
HTATIP2 expression and low MVD became independent
risk factors when patients were treated with sorafenib as a
postsurgical adjuvant therapy. Moreover, the combination
of high HTATIP2 expression with low MVD predicted the
best outcome for patients without sorafenib administration,
but predicted the worst outcome for those administered
sorafenib, compared with the two markers alone and other
clinicopathological factors. Furthermore, these findings
were confirmed using an independent cohort that included
patients with advanced HCC.
HTATIP2, also known as 30-kilodalton HIV-1 Tat
interacting protein (TIP30) or CC3, typically functions
as a tumor suppressor and was initially identified in the
highly metastatic human variant small cell lung carcinoma
(SCLC) in comparison with the less metastatic classic
SCLC cell lines[17]. HTATIP2 frequently exhibits
downregulation in various tumor cells, such as breast
cancer, colon cancer, pancreatic cancer, melanoma,
glioblastoma, neuroblastoma, SCLC, and HCC cells[14,
17-22]. Studies in HTATIP2-deficient mice showed a
dramatically increased susceptibility to tumorigenesis,
including that of HCC[21, 23]. Other studies have shown
that HTATIP2 inhibits human HCC cell growth and
metastasis, as well as induce apoptosis, in vitro and in
vivo [12, 13, 24]. In a previous study, we validated the
suppressive role of HTATIP2 on HCC cells, a function
that was related to the inhibition of the epithelial-tomesenchymal transition (EMT) [10]. In the present study,
we further revealed that patients with relatively high
HTATIP2 expression tended to have a small tumor volume,
diminished metastases, and prolonged postoperative
survival, and these findings were consistent with those

In conclusion, our results signify that the
combination of HTATIP2 and MVD predicts the converse
survival of HCC with or without sorafenib intervention
and that patients with high HTATIP2 expression and low
MVD level may not benefit from this drug. This finding
can be used for the selection of candidates for personalized
treatment with sorafenib. To date, given that no molecular
biomarkers have been found that can predict the outcome
of sorafenib treatment, our findings offer new hope for
this unexplored avenue and lay the foundation for further
translation in a prospective study.

least one untreated target lesion that could be measured
in one dimension. Response rate [i.e., complete response
(CR), partial response (PR), stable disease (SD), and
progressive disease (PD)] was measured according to
RECIST (Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors)
guidelines (v1.1)[35] by independent radiologic review.
OS and progression-free survival (PFS) were defined as
the interval between the dates of administration and death,
and between the dates of administration and radiologic
progression, respectively. If progression was not verified,
patients were censored on the date of death or the last
follow-up.
The detailed patient survival is summarized in the
Supplemental Materials and Methods. The present study
was approved by the appropriate ethics committees, and
informed consent was obtained from each patient.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patient selection:

Tissue microarrays (TMAs):

Three independent cohorts (Table 1) were
included in the present study. In cohort 1, 297 patients
who underwent curative liver resection for pathologyproven HCC at the Liver Cancer Institute of Zhongshan
Hospital, Fudan University were tested. They were
followed up between October 2004 and November 2010
(72 months). From January 2010 to June 2013, 421
consecutive patients underwent curative resection for
HCC by the same surgical team in our department, and
143 patients (cohort 2) were randomly retrieved from a
prospectively collected database. Cohort 2 comprised
69 cases who received sorafenib as adjuvant therapy
postresection and 74 cases who received only standardof-care therapy as the control. All the cases were observed
until December 2013, with a median observation time of
17.8 months. None received anticancer treatment before
surgery or sorafenib administration. The criteria for
resectability, specimen collection, and follow-up have
been described elsewhere[15, 31-33]. OS and RFS were
defined as the interval between the dates of surgery and
death, and between the dates of surgery and recurrence,
respectively. Treatment modalities after relapse were
administered according to uniform guidelines as described
previously[31, 34]. If recurrence was not diagnosed,
patients were censored on the date of death or the last
follow-up.
From June 2011 to June 2013, 114 patients
who received sorafenib therapy for core-needle liver
biopsy-confirmed advanced HCC in our hospital
were retrospectively analyzed. No patients had
received previous systemic treatment before sorafenib
administration. Among them, the quality of the tumor
sample was found to be unreliable in 21 cases, and the
tumor response was not evaluable in another 10 cases.
Eighty-three cases (cohort 3) with reliable sample
quality as well as an evaluable tumor response were
examined. Follow-up (every 1.5 months) was completed
in December 2013. Patients were required to have at

For cohorts 1 and 2, the postoperative tumor
specimens were collected and then constructed into TMAs
(Shanghai Biochip Company Ltd, Shanghai, China). TMA
construction was performed as described previously[15,
32]. Two 1.0-mm-diameter cores, drilled from each
representative formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tumor
tissue, were sent to make TMA slides. Accordingly, two
cylinders from different areas of the tumor samples were
obtained, and a total of four TMA chips for cohort 1 and
two chips for cohort 2 were prepared.

Core-needle biopsy:
For cohort 3, the tumor specimens were acquired
aseptically through sonographically guided 18-gauge
core-needle biopsy of the liver. Next, the samples were
collected and made into paraffin sections. All the patients
were diagnosed with advanced-stage HCC, as confirmed
by independent pathological analysis, before sorafenib
administration.

Immunohistochemistry and evaluation:
Immunohistochemistry in TMAs and other paraffin
sections (4-μm thick) was performed by a two-step
method as described previously[15, 33]. The primary
rabbit monoclonal anti-human HTATIP2 (1:100; Abcam,
Cambridge, MA) and mouse monoclonal anti-human
CD34 (1:100; Abcam) antibodies were utilized. CD34
was used as a biomarker for vascular endothelial cells, and
its immunostaining density was represented by the tumor
MVD[15, 16, 36]. The Envision-plus detection system
with an anti-rabbit/mouse polymer (Dako, Glostrup,
Denmark) was employed. All the sections were stained
under the same automation system. Negative controls

were treated identically but with omission of the primary
antibody.
For all sections, the density of positive staining
in whole view was measured using a computerized
image system composed of a Leica charge-coupled
device camera (DFC500) connected to a Leica DMIRE2 microscope (Leica, Cambridge, UK)[32]. Briefly,
images of five representative fields at ×200 magnification
were captured using Leica QWin Plus v3 software, and
identical settings were used for each image. For evaluation
of HTATIP2 expression and MVD values, the integrated
optical density (IOD) and areas of immunostaining in
all the images were measured using Image-Pro Plus
v6.2 software. A uniform setting for all the sections was
applied. Results were quantified as HTATIP2 IOD/total
area, and as CD34-positive area/total area.

Analyses were performed using SPSS 16.0 for
Windows. The cutoff point of the HTATIP2 density or
MVD for the definition of subgroups (high- versus lowrisk groups) was the median value. Pearson’s χ2 test was
used to compare qualitative variables, and quantitative
variables were analyzed by t or Spearman’s test. Data were
described by Pearson’s correlation coefficient to determine
the association between HTATIP2 expression and MVD.
Cumulative survival curves were estimated using the
Kaplan–Meier method, and differences between the curves
were calculated using the log-rank test. Independent
prognostic significance of risk factors identified by
univariate analysis was computed by the Cox regression
model. ROC curve analysis was applied to determine
the predictive value among the parameters. Statistical
significance was set at a two-sided P value<0.05.
