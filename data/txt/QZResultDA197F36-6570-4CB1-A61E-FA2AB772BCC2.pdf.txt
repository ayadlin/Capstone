ABSTRACT
Cisplatin and other platinum-based drugs have been widely used in the treatment
of ovarian cancer, but most patients acquire the drug resistance that greatly
compromises the efficacy of drugs. Understanding the mechanism of drug resistance
is important for finding new therapeutic approaches. In the present study, we found
that the expression of vimentin was downregulated in drug-resistant ovarian cancer
cell lines A2780-DR and HO-8910 as compared to their respective control cells.
Overexpression of vimentin in A2780-DR cells markedly increased their sensitivity
to cisplatin, whereas knockdown of vimentin in A2780, HO-8910-PM and HO-8910
cells increased the resistance to cisplatin, demonstrating that vimentin silencing
enhanced cisplatin resistance in ovarian cancer cells. Quantitative proteomic analysis
identified 95 differentially expressed proteins between the vimentin silenced A2780
cells (A2780-VIM-KN) and the control cells, in which downregulation of endocytic
proteins and the upregulation of exocytotic proteins CHMP2B and PDZK1 were
proposed to contribute the decreased cisplatin accumulation in vimentin knockdown
cells. Silencing of vimentin induced upregulation of cancer stem cell markers and both
A2780-DR and A2780-VIM-KN cells were more facile to form spheroids than control
cells under serum-free culture condition. Our results also revealed that vimentin
knockdown increased the 14-3-3 mediated retention of Cdc25C in the cytoplasm,
leading to inactivation of Cdk1 and the prolonged G2 phase arrest that allowed the
longer period of time for cells to repair cisplatin-damaged DNA. Taken together,
we demonstrated that vimentin silencing enhanced cells’ resistance to cisplatin via
prolonged G2 arrest and increased exocytosis, suggesting that vimentin is a potential
target for treatment of drug resistant ovarian cancer.

drug resistance in ovarian cancer has been attributed to many
factors including intracellular cisplatin inactivation, reduced
intracellular drug accumulation, increased DNA repair and
defects in cell death signaling pathways [4]. Intracellular
cisplatin strongly binds to GSH, methionine, metallothionein
and other cysteine-rich proteins, which decrease the amount
of active cisplatin in cells [5, 6]. Reduced intracellular drug
accumulation is regulated by CTR1, ATP7A and ATP7B.
The knockout of CTR1 which contributes to the influx of
cisplatin significantly enhances the resistance to cisplatin
compared to control cells [7]. Overexpression of ATP7A or
ATP7B responsible for the efflux of cisplatin increases the

INTRODUCTION
Ovarian cancer causes the majority death in women
with gynecological cancer. Patients with ovarian cancer
are normally treated with surgical resection followed
by platinum/taxane-based chemotherapy. However, the
acquisition of resistance to currently available drugs during
therapy is frequently present in ovarian cancer patients that
have greatly compromised the therapeutic efficacy [1–3].
Understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying
drug resistance is urgently needed to improve patients’
survival rates and qualities of their lives. Platinum-based

the expression levels of exocytotic proteins. We revealed
that silencing of vimentin induced the prolonged G2 phase
arrest and the acquired stem cell-like phenotype. Our data
proposed a new mechanism underlying vimentin-mediated
cisplatin resistance and suggested that vimentin was a new
therapeutic target for treating drug-resistant ovarian cancer.

resistance to cisplatin [8]. The binding of cisplatin and DNA
leads to DNA cross-links and induces cell death. Increased
repair of damaged DNA contributes to the drug resistance
[9–12]. GADD45 and ERCC1 in NER pathway were found
to be upregulated in drug resistant cells [11, 12]. Defects
in cell death signaling pathways are also present in drug
resistant cells. For example, AKT was phosphorylated by
DNA-PK which inhibited cisplatin-mediated apoptosis [13].
Our previous study showed that vimentin was
downregulated in drug resistant ovarian cancer cell line
A2780-DR [14]. Vimentin, a member of the intermediate
filament (IF) family, is ubiquitously expressed in
mesenchymal cells. As a cytoskeleton protein, vimentin is
known to support and anchor the organelles and maintain
cellular integrity [15]. In the recent years, increased
vimentin expression has been found in a wide range
of epithelial cancers including gastrointestinal tumors,
prostate cancer, breast cancer, CNS tumors, lung cancer, and
malignant melanoma [16–21]. Vimentin has been regarded
as a canonical marker of epithelial–mesenchymal transition
(EMT) [22], a cellular reprogramming process in which
epithelial cells get mesenchymal phenotype in shape and
motility. Upregulation of vimentin in cancers positively
correlates with increased tumor invasion, growth and poor
prognosis [15]. However, relatively little is known about the
effects of vimentin expression on drug resistance in ovarian
cancer cells. In addition to our previous study showing that
vimentin was downregulated in cisplatin-resistant cells,
vimentin downregulation was also present in ovarian cancer
cells with acquired resistance to two tubulin-targeting drugs,
peloruside A and laulimalide [23], suggesting that vimentin
silencing promotes drug resistance in ovarian cancer cells.
In the present work, vimentin downregulation was
confirmed in cisplatin-resistant ovarian cancer cell lines
A2780-DR and HO-8910 compared to their respective
drug-sensitive controls. Further studies demonstrated that
vimentin knockdown in A2780, HO-8910-PM and HO8910 cells increased the drug resistance to cisplatin and the
overexpression of vimentin in A2780-DR cells increased the
sensitivities to cisplatin. Differentially expressed proteins
between A2780-VIM-KN cells and the control cells were
identified showing that vimentin knockdown increased

RESULTS
Expression of vimentin was downregulated in
drug-resistant ovarian cancer cells
In the present study, two pairs of cell lines, A2780/
A2780-DR and HO-8910/HO-8910-PM were used to
examine the effects of vimentin expression on drug
resistance. In consistent with the previous report, A2780-DR
displayed a higher resistance against cisplatin (Figure 1a).
HO-8910 and HO-8910-PM cells were commonly used
for studying metastasis in ovarian cancer, in which HO8910-PM cells were derived from HO-8910 cells with a
higher metastasis potential. The cell cytotoxicity assay
revealed that HO-8910 cells displayed the higher resistance
against cisplatin than HO-8910-PM cells (Figure 1b). The
expression of vimentin was examined by western blotting
showing that vimentin expression was downregulated in both
drug resistant cells A2780-DR and HO-8910 (Figure 1c),
in which vimentin expression was 1.5 fold lower in A2780DR cells and 1.3 fold lower in HO-8910 cells than that
in A2780 and HO-8910-PM cells, respectively, based on
image gray scale analysis (Figure 1d). Downregulation of
vimentin was also found in ovarian cancer cells resistant
to peloruside A and laulimalide [23]. These results propose
that the expression levels of vimentin are negatively
correlated to drug resistance in ovarian cancer cells.

vimentin was overexpressed in A2780-DR cells (A2780-DRVIM-OE) were established. The silencing and overexpression
of vimentin in A2780 and A2780-DR cells were respectively
verified by western blotting and qPCR analysis (Figure 2(a-b),
Supplementary Figure S1(a-b)). The cell proliferation rates
were measured by the CCK-8 assay showing that A2780 cells
grew faster than A2780-DR cells in consistent with our earlier
results (Figure 2c) whereas vimentin knockdown decreased
the proliferation rate of A2780 cells (Figure 2d) and vimentin
overexpression increased the proliferation rates of A2780-DR
cells (Figure 2e). This demonstrated that the low expression of
vimentin positively correlates with the low proliferation rates
of ovarian cancer cells. The survival rates of A2780-VIMKN, A2780-DR-VIM-OE and control cells were measured
after cells were treated with different concentrations of
cisplatin for 24h and results showed that silencing of vimentin
in A2780 cells increased cell resistance to cisplatin (Figure
2f) whereas overexpression of vimentin in A2780-DR cells
decreased cell resistance to cisplatin (Figure 2g). Similarly,
downregulation of vimentin in HO-8910-PM and HO-8910
cells also increased cell resistance to cisplatin (Figure 2(h-i),
Supplementary Figure S1(c-e)). Silencing of vimentin also
decreased the proliferation rates of HO-8910-PM and HO8910 cells (Figure 2j, Supplementary Figure S1f).

[24, 25]. Intermediate filament proteins including alphainternexin, nestin (NEST) and neurofilament heavy
polypeptide were also down regulated in A2780-VIMKN cells. Furthermore, desmoplakin (DSP) which
plays a role in anchoring the intermediate filaments
to the desmosomes [26, 27], and cingulin (CGN) that
involved in regulation of the tight junction (TJ) [28]
were downregulated in A2780-VIM-KN cells. Changes
in protein expression levels of SEPT6, COTL1, INF2,
NEST, DSP and INA between A2780-DR, A2780-VIMKN and their respective control cells were confirmed by
the parallel reaction monitoring (PRM)-based targeted
mass spectrometry analysis (Figure 3b), indicating most
differently expressed proteins between A2780-VIM-KN
and control cells were also changed in the same trend
between A2780 and A2780-DR cells. Furthermore,
vimentin knockdown also induced downregulations
in mRNA expression levels of SEPT6, EPS8, CGN,
COTL1, INF2 and NEST in A2780-VIM-KN cells as
probed by qPCR analysis (Figure 3c). The qPCR analysis
also confirmed changes in mRNA expressions of other
proteins including FIGNL1, BDH2, DYNLT1, APBA2,
LRP4, AGRN and STMN3 between A2780-VIM-KN and
the control cells (Supplementary Figure S2).

Vimentin-silencing induced downregulation of
proteins in cytoskeleton organization

Vimentin silencing downregulated endocytosis
and upregulated exocytosis leading to a decrease
of cellular cisplatin accumulation

To understand the effects of vimentin on drug
resistance in ovarian cancer cells, proteomic analysis
was carried out to identify the differentially expressed
proteins between A2780-VIM-KN and control cells.
The experiments were carried out in three biological
replicates, resulting in identification of 6362 proteins.
Based on tandem mass tag (TMT) ratios (> 1.5 or <0.6)
in proteins with more than two unique peptide matches,
95 differentially expressed proteins were found between
A2780-VIM-KN and control cells, in which 47 proteins
were upregulated and 48 downregulated (Supplementary
Table S3 and S4). The Gene ontology (GO) analysis of
the differentially expressed proteins was carried out and
summarized according to their molecular functions via
a pie plot by the PANTHER bioinformatics platform
(http://www.pantherdb.org/) (Figure 3a). About half
of differentially expressed proteins participated in the
cellular processes and metabolic processes. Vimentin is
an intermediate filament protein and its downregulation
can induce cytoskeleton reorganization. Indeed, we found
that proteins regulating the organization of the actin
cytoskeleton were downregulated in A2780-VIM-KN
cells including isoform I of septin-6 (SEPT6), epidermal
growth factor receptor kinase substrate 8 (EPS8),
coactosin-like protein (COTL1), isoform 2 of Inverted
formin-2 (INF2), cofilin-2 (CFL2) and alpha-actinin-3
(ACTN3). The actin cytoskeleton strengthens the
adherens junction which is formed primarily by cadherin

Among differentially expressed proteins between
A2780-control and A2780-VIM-KN cells, two proteins
Na(+)/H(+) exchange regulatory cofactor NHE-RF3
(PDZK1) and charged multivesicular body protein 2b
(CHMP2B) that regulated exocytosis were upregulated
in A2780-VIM-KN cells, whereas isoform 1 of vesicle
transport through interaction with t-SNAREs homolog 1A
(VTI1A) involving in endocytosis was downregulated in
A2780-VIM-KN cells. PDZK1 interacts with MRP2, a
cellular cisplatin transporter and associated with multidrug
resistance [29]. CHMP2B is the core component of
endosomal secretary complex required for transport
complex III (ESCRITIII) [30]. VTI1A, a member of
SNARE protein family, promote endosome membrane
fusion in endocytosis pathway [31, 32]. The expression
levels of PDZK1 and CHMP2B were confirmed by qPCR
analysis and western blotting while VTI1A was only
slightly decreased in A278-VIM-KN cells (Figure 4a,
Supplementary Figure S3(a-b)). CHMP2B and PDZK1
were also upregulated in A2780-DR, HO-8910 and HO8910-PM-VIM-KN cells as compared to their respective
control cells whereas changes in VTI1A expression were
not significant among A2780-DR, HO-8910 and HO8910-PM-VIM-KN cells (Figure 4(b-d), Supplementary
Figure S3(c-e)), suggesting that CHMP2B and PDZK1
decreased cellular cisplatin accumulation in drug resistant
cells.

To explore whether vimentin downregulation led to
decreased intracellular cisplatin accumulation, the relative
cellular cisplatin concentrations were measured in the drug
resistant cells and control cells using mass spectrometry.
Results revealed that the cisplatin concentration in A2780DR, A2780-VIM-KN, HO-8910 and HO-8910-PM-VIMKN cells were less than that in their respective control
cells after cells were treated with 20 μM cisplatin for

24 h (Figure 4(e-h)), indicating that downregulation of
vimentin decreased of cellular cisplatin accumulation to
enhance cells’ resistance to cisplatin.
To further validate that CHMP2B and PDZK1
upregulation decreased the cellular cisplatin accumulation,
CHMP2B and PDZK1 were silenced in both A2780-DR
and HO-8910 cells as verified by western blotting (Figure
4(i-j), Supplemental Figure S3f). Silencing of CHMP2B

and PDZK1 in both A2780-DR and HO-8910 cells led to
decreased cellular cisplatin accumulation (Figure 4(l-m)).
On the other hand, silencing of VTI1A in both A2780 and
HO-8910-PM cells had no effects on cellular cisplatin
accumulation in these cells (Figure 4(k, n-o)). Our results
declared that the vimentin downregulation increased
CHMP2B and PDZK1 expression, which decreased the
cellular cisplatin accumulation in drug resistant cells.

and CD133 were also upregulated in A2780-DR cells as
compared to A2780 cells (Supplementary Figure S4(b-d)),
and consequently, A2780-DR cells were more facile to form
spheroid than A2780 cells (Supplementary Figure S4e).
CD133 was also upregulated in HO-8910-PM-VIM-KN cells
as compared to the control cells (Supplementary Figure S4f).
This suggests that vimentin knockdown reprograms cells to
acquire cancer stem cell phenotype.

A2780-VIM-KN and A2780-DR cells exhibited
stem cell-like phenotypes

Downregulation of vimentin led to a prolonged
G2 arrest in drug-resistant cells

Proteomics also showed that ALDH1A1 (Retinal
dehydrogenase 1), a cancer stem cell marker, was upregulated
in A2780-VIM-KN cells, as confirmed by western blotting
and qPCR analysis (Figure 5(a-b), Supplementary Figure
S4a). The other stem cell marker CD133 was also found to
be upregulated in A2780-VIM-KN cells by qPCR analysis
and flow cytometry analysis (FACS) (Figure 5(a, c)). To
further validate that A2780-VIM-KN cells exhibited the
characteristics of cancer stem cells, A2780-VIM-KN and
control cells were planted into ultralow adhesion tissue
culture plates. After 10 days, A2780-VIM-KN cells formed
spheroid (Figure 5e) while control cells remained in its
original morphology (Figure 5d). We re-cultured spheroids
of cells in the stem cell medium and they remained in
sphere shape after several generations (Figure 5f). However,
the culturing of spheroids of cells in the medium with
FBS resulted in the immediate adhesion of cells to the
plate (Figure 5g) and restoration of cells’ morphology of
A2780-VIM-KN cells (Figure 5h). Similarly, ALDH1A1

The above results have shown that cells with higher
cisplatin resistance tend to grow slower than the respective
drug sensitive cells (Figure 2(c-e, j)); indicating that cell
cycle progression varies among those different cells.
Indeed, cell cycle analysis of A2780-DR, A2780-VIM-KN,
A2780-DR-VIM-OE, and control cells showed that A2780DR, A2780-VIM-KN and A2780-DR-control cells have
higher G2/M phase accumulation than their drug sensitive
counterparts (Figure 6(a-c), Supplementary S5a). Similar
results were found in HO-8910-PM-VIM-KN and control
cells (Figure 6d). These results suggested that drug resistant
cells were prone to have a prolonged G2 phase. It has been
known that cyclin B was highly expressed in M phase, and
therefore, the low cyclin B expression was expected to
be present in drug resistant cells. This was confirmed by
western blotting analysis showing that cyclin B expression
was lower in A2780-DR, A2780-VIM-KN, HO-8910VIM-KN cells as compared to their respective control cells
(Figure 6(e-g), Supplementary Figure S5(b-d)), whereas

vimentin overexpression upregulated cyclin B in A2780DR cells (Figure 6(h), Supplementary Figure S5e). The
downregulation of cyclin B supported that drug resistant
cells had prolonged G2 phase. Furthermore, no difference
in Cdk1 expression that regulated G2-M transition was
identified between A2780 and A2780-DR cells whereas
phosphorylation of Cdk1 at Tyr15 (Y15) site was increased
in A2780-DR cells (Figure 6i, Supplementary Figure S5f).
Phosphorylation of Cdk1 was increased in A2780-VIMKN cells and decreased in A2780-DR-VIM-OE cells
as compared to control cells (Figure 6j, Supplementary
Figure S5g). Similar results were found in HO-8910-PMVIM-KN cells and control cells (Figure 6k, Supplemental
Figure S5h). The phosphorylation of Y15 in Cdk1 by
members of the Wee1/Mik1/Myt1 protein kinase family
renders Cdk1 in the inactive state, resulting in a G2 arrest
[33]. It is well known that activity of Cdk1 is regulated by
Cdc25C. Expressions of Cdc25C in different subcellular

localizations were examined by western blotting. The
expression level of Cdc25C was higher in the cytoplasmic
fraction but lower in the nuclear fraction of A2780-DR
and A2780-VIM-KN cells as compared to the control
cells (Figure 6(l-m), Supplementary Figure S5(i-j)). On
the contrary, Cdc25C had the opposite cellular distribution
in A2780-DR-VIM-OE compared to control cells (Figure
6n, Supplementary Figure S5k). Similar results were
found in HO-8910-PM-VIM-KN and control cells (Figure
6o, Supplementary Figure S5l), indicating Cdc25C was
retained in cytoplasm in drug resistant cells leading to the
inactivation of Cdk1 and the prolonged G2 arrest.

DISCUSSION
Downregulation of vimentin was identified in
widely used drug resistant ovarian cancer cell lines in the
present and previous studies [14, 23], suggesting that the

cisplatin accumulation. Vimentin knockdown also
reprograms cells to acquire cancer stem cell properties and
induces a prolonged G2 arrest which contributes to drug
resistance. Vimentin is a potential therapeutic target for
treatment of resistance ovarian cancers.

low expression of vimentin correlated with drug resistance
in ovarian cancer cells. Silencing of vimentin expression
in A2780, HO-8910-PM and HO-8910 cells resulted in
markedly increase the cell resistance to cisplatin further
demonstrating that vimentin mediates drug resistance in
ovarian cancer cells (Figure 2(f, i), Supplementary Figure
S1f). This is rather interesting since vimentin is considered
as a marker of mesenchymal cells and EMT is proposed to
induce chemoresistance.
We carried out proteomic analysis to identify
differentially expressed proteins between A2780-VIM-KN
and control cells, showing that expressions of exocytotic
proteins PDZK1 and CHMP2B were upregulated and that
of endocytic protein VTI1A was downregulated, which
contributed to the lower cisplatin accumulation in A2780VIM-KN cells. This was further confirmed by the fact that
overexpression of PDZK1 and CHMP2B in drug resistant
cells decreased cellular cisplatin accumulation.
Downregulation of vimentin also decreased
expressions of proteins participating in anchoring junction
and tight junction in A2780-VIM-KN cells, which
destabilized both anchoring junction and tight junction,
leading to the emergence of cancer stem cell [34, 35]. This
was confirmed by finding that cancer stem cell markers
ALDH1A1 and CD133 were upregulated in A2780-DR and
A2780-VIM-KN cells that were facile to form spheroids of
cells under nutrient deprivation. CD133 was also upregulated
in HO-8910-PM-VIM-KN cells compared with control
cells (Supplementary Figure S4d). It is known that cancer
stem cells exhibited the higher resistance to drug treatment
[36, 37]. Therefore, we propose that vimentin-knockdown
enhanced drug resistance in A2780 cells is partially arisen
from the acquired cancer stem cell properties.
Our results also showed that downregulation of
vimentin induced a prolonged G2 arrest in drug-resistant
cells. The G2 arrest is triggered when cells experience DNA
damage during G2 phase or sensitize unrepaired damage
accumulated in prior S or G1 phases, which allows the
longer period of time to repair the damaged DNA and to
prevent segregation of damaged chromosomes [38–40]. G2
arrest is regulated by subcellular localization of Cdc25C.
When Cdc25C is phosphorylated and remains in cytosol by
binding to 14-3-3 proteins, Cdk1 is highly phosphorylated
and in inactive state that induces G2-M cell cycle arrest
[41–47]. Previous studies demonstrated that phosphorylated
vimentin interacts with 14-3-3 protein to prevent the binding
of 14-3-3 with other proteins [48]. Our results propose
that downregulation of vimentin in cisplatin resistant cells
increases availability of 14-3-3 proteins, which binds to
Cdc25C and retains Cdc25C in the cytoplasm. This led to the
inactivation of Cdk1 and the prolonged G2 arrest that allows
sufficient time to repair cisplatin induced DNA damage and
prevents cells proceed to necrosis or apoptosis [49].
Taken together, our results demonstrate that
vimentin silencing in ovarian cancer cells upregulates
proteins of the exocytotic process to decrease cellular

Cell culture
Human epithelial ovarian cancer cell lines
A2780 and A2780-DR were grown in DMEM medium
supplemented with 10% FBS and penicillin (100 U/
ml)–streptomycin (100 μg/ml) at 37 °C with 5% CO2
in a humidified incubator. Human epithelial ovarian
cancer cell lines HO-8910 and HO-8910-PM were
obtained from the cell bank of the Chinese Academy
of Sciences (Shanghai, China) and cells were grown
in DMEM medium supplemented with 10% FBS and
1% penicillin/streptomycin at 37 °C in a humidified
incubator with 5% CO2.

Construction of vimentin-knockdown A2780,
HO-8910-PM and HO-8910 cell line
The shRNA against vimentin was designed
with an online tool (http://hannonlab.cshl.edu/GH_
research.html). The sequence of vimentin targeting
shRNA was AACACACTCAGTGCAGCAATAT. NCi
was non-targeting scrambled control of shRNA. The
oligonucleotides were annealed and inserted into the
pll3.7 shRNA expression vector to generate shRNA.
Pll3.7-VIMi or Pll3.7-Nci plasmids were transfected
with packing vectors into 293T cells using PEI. 48 h
later, the lentivirus particles in cell culture supernatant
were then collected and concentrated with PEG6000.
Then, precipitated lentivirus particles were resuspended

for 16 h at 37 °C. The digestion was stopped with 10 %
trifluoracetic acid, after which peptides were desalted
using HLB extraction cartridges and eluted using 1 ml
methanol. Extracts were then centrifuged in a speedvac to
reduce the volume. After that, peptides were redissolved
in 100 μl 200 mM Tetraethylammonium Bromide (TEAB)
and labeled with TMT sixplex labeling reagent for 1
h at room temperature according to the manufacture’s
instruction. The reaction was then quenched by adding 5
μl of 5% hydroxylamine in TEAB and incubating 15 min.
The TMT-labeled peptides were combined and desalted
using C18 sep-pak cartridges. The elution extracts were
centrifuged in a speedvac to reduce the volume. Then the
TMT-labeled peptides complex was separated by HPLC.
For HPLC separation, the TMT-labeled peptides were
separated with a C-18 column (XbridgeTMBEH 300 C18
5 μm Waters) at a flow rate 1 ml/min by the following
gradient elution. Mobile phase A was 100% H2O and
mobile phase B consisted of 98% acetonitrile and 2% H2O.
The pH of both mobile phase A and B were adjusted to 10.
The fractions were centrifuged in a speedvac to reduce the
volume and analyzed by LC-MS/MS.
For LC-MS/MS analysis, the TMT-labeled peptides
were separated by a 120 min gradient elution with a
flow rate of 0.250 μl/min in a Thermo-Dionex Ultimate
3000 HPLC system, which was directly connected with
a Thermo Scientific Q Exactive mass spectrometer. The
analytical column was a home-made C-18 (300 Å, 5 μm,
Varian, Lexington, MA) resin packed fused silica capillary
column (75 μm ID, 150 mm length; Upchurch, Oak
Harbor, WA). Mobile phase A consisted of 0.1% formic
acid, and mobile phase B consisted of 100% acetonitrile
and 0.1% formic acid. The Q Exactive mass spectrometer
was operated by Xcalibur 2.1.2 software in the datadependent acquisition mode and 10 data-dependent MS/
MS scans at 29% normalized collision energy followed a
single full-scan mass spectrum in the orbitrap (400 –1800
m/z, 60,000 resolution).
The peak lists from LC-MS/MS analysis were
generated with Proteome Discoverer software (version
1.4.1.14, release date of December, 2012). The MS/
MS spectra from each LC-MS/MS run were searched
against the human.fasta database downloaded from
Uniprot (release date of January 10, 2015; 89105
sequences) using an in-house Sequest HT Algorithmin
Proteome Discoverer software. Common contaminants
were included in the database. The search criteria were
the followings: full tryptic specificity was required; one
missed cleavage was allowed; carbamidomethylation (C)
and TMT sixplex (K and N-terminal) were set as the fixed
modifications; the oxidation (M) was set as thevariable
modification; precursor ion mass tolerance was set at 20
ppm for all MS acquired in an orbitrap mass analyzer; and
the fragment mass tolerance was set at 20 mmu for all
MS2 spectra acquired in Q Exactive mass spectrometer.
Peptide spectral matches (PSM) were validated using the

in PBS and added into the A2780, HO-8910-PM and
HO-8910 cells plated the day before transfection with
5 μg/mL polybrene. Cells expressing Pll3.7 plasmid
co-expressed GFP. After 72 h, a single GFP-expressing
cell was sorting into one single well in a 96-well
plate by FACS. A2780-VIM-KN, HO-8910-PM-VIMKN and HO-8910-VIM-KN cell lines which are with
high effectiveness of inhibiting vimentin expression
evaluated by western blotting and qPCR were selected
and used in the present study and A2780, HO-8910-PM
and HO-8910 cells transfected with lentivirus vectors
containing non-targeting scrambled shRNA were used
as control cells.

Generation of A2780-DR cells stably
overexpressing vimentin
Vimentin (GenBank accession number: 003380.3)
was cloned from cDNA reversely transcripted from RNA
of A2780-DR cells. The Flag-tag was inserted at the C
terminus of vimentin and subcloned into pLVX-IRESZsGreen1 expression vector. Vimentin overexpression
cells (A2780-DR-VIM-OE) were constructed and isolated
using the protocol described above. A2780-DR cells
transfected with empty vector were used as the control.

Cell proliferation assay with CCK-8
Cells were seeded in 96-well plates with 2000 cells/
well. Cell proliferation rate was determined with the Cell
Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions (Dojindo Laboratories, Kumamoto, Japan).
Briefly, CCK-8 reagents were added into wells after
cells grew for 0, 12, 24, 36, 48, 72, 84, 96 h respectively.
Absorbance at 450 nm was measured 2 h after CCK-8
addition.

Cell cytotoxicity assay
Cells (8 × 103 each) were seeded in 96-wellplates
and cultured for 16 h followed by cisplatin treatment at
different concentrations (0, 20, 40, 60, 80 and 160 μM)
in triplicates for 24 h. Cell numbers was assessed by
measuring absorbance at 450 nm with the CCK-8 assay.
Cell viability was calculated as the percentage of variable
cells compared with untreated cells.

Proteomics analysis
Proteomic analysis was carried out in biological
triplicate. Briefly, A2780-VIM-KN and control cells
were lysed with 8 M urea in PBS pH 7.4. Equal amount
of proteins from each samples (200 μg) were reduced
with 1 mM dithiotreitol for 1 h and alkylated with 5.5
mM iodoacetamide for 40 min in the dark. Proteins
were digested with sequencing grade modified trypsin

based on q-values at a 1% false discovery rate (FDR). A
peptide whose sequence is only assigned to a given protein
group was considered as unique. The false discovery
rate was also set to 0.01 for protein identifications.
Relative protein quantification was performed using
Proteome Discoverer software (Version 1.4) according to
manufacturer’s instructions on the reporter ion intensities
per peptide. Proteins with at least two unique peptides
were regarded as confident identifications and were further
quantified. Protein ratios were calculated as the median

elution time. The selection of target precursor ions was
performed based on the normal proteomics data acquired
in data dependent acquisition mode. Lists of target
peptides, target precursor ions, and selected fragment
ions are provided in Supplementary Table S2 . PRM
acquisition was performed using a resolution of 17,500,
individual isolation windows of 2 h, target AGC values
of 1 × 106, and equal individual fill times within each
subset with maximum values of 100 ms. Fragmentation
was performed with a normalized collision energy of 25,
and MS/MS scans were acquired with a starting mass of
m/z 100. Data analyses were typically performed using
Xcalibur (Thermo Scientific). Mass tolerance of fragment
ions was set at 20 mmu. Fragment ions resulting from
neutral losses and low m/z ions (typically below m/z
200–300) were omitted. At least three fragment ions with
the highest intensity were selected to ensure accuracy.
The peak areas of fragment ions were used to calculate
the relative intensity of precursor ion for selected peptides.
At least two peptides were selected for the quantification
of one protein. The means of the relative intensity of
selected peptides represented the relative expression level
of proteins.

Western blotting and qPCR
For western blotting analysis, equal amount of
proteins of A2780-control or A2780-VIM-KN cells were
denatured at 100 °C boiled 5 min with SDS loading
buffer. The proteins were transferred to PVDF transfer
membrane by electroblotting after SDS-PAGE separation.
Membranes were probed with the indicated antibodies
overnight at 4 °C followed by immunoblotting analysis.
β-actin was internal control. The gray intensity analysis
of western blotting images was carried out by imageJ
software. Total RNA was reversely transcribed using
HIScript 1st Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (Vazyme, Nanjing,
China). The primers for quantitative RT-PCR of cDNA
were listed in Supplementary Table S1.

Spheroid forming assays
1×106 A2780-VIM-KN and control cells were
seeded into 6-well ultralow adhesion tissue culture
plates (Corning Incorporated, USA) in 2 ml DMEM with
glutamine and penicillin/streptomycin. When spheroids
were formed, cells were collected and grown in 60 mm
cell culture plate in stem cell medium: serum free DMEM
media supplemented with 10% serum replacement
(Gibco), 10 ng/ml human recombinant epidermal growth
factor (EGF) and 10 ng/ml basic fibroblast growth factor
(bFGF). For the differentiation of spheroid cells, cells
were grown in DMEM with 10% FBS and penicillin (1 U/
ml)–streptomycin (100 μg/ml).

Validation of differentially expressed proteins by
parallel reaction monitoring

Cell cycle analysis

Equal amount of proteins from A2780-control cells
and A2780-VIM-KN cells (80 μg) were separated by 1D
SDS-PAGE, respectively. The gel bands of interest were
excised from the gel, reduced with 25 mM of DTT and
alkylated with 55 mM iodoacetamide which was followed
by in-gel digestion with sequencing grade modified
trypsin at 37 °C overnight. The peptides were extracted
twice with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in 50% acetonitrile
aqueous solution for 30 min and then dried in a speedvac.
Peptides were redissolved in 20 μl 0.1% trifluoroacetic
acid and 6 μl of extracted peptides were analyzed by
Thermo Scientific Q Exactive mass spectrometer in
parallel reaction monitoring (PRM) mode. The acquisition
method contained a full scan MS and a PRM event. The
PRM event targeted the precursor ion for each selected
peptide in ±4 min monitoring windows depending on their

Cells were harvested by trypsinization, washed
3 times by ice-cold PBS and fixed with 70% ethanol
overnight at 4°C. The fixed cells were resuspended in
PBS, treated with RNase and stained with PI followed by
FACS analysis. The percentage of cells in each cell cycle
phase was assessed using Modfit software.

Cell cytoplasm and nucleus extraction
Cells were harvested by trypsinization, washed 3
times with ice-cold PBS and the packed cell volume (PCV)
was estimated. The cell pellet was resuspended gently in 5 x
PCV of lysis buffer (10 mM HEPES, pH 7.9, with 1.5 mM
MgCl2, 10 mM KCl and 1 mM DTT) and incubated on ice
for 15 minutes, allowing cells to swell. The suspended cells

were centrifuged for 5 minutes at 420 x g and the pellet of
packed cells was resuspended in 2 x PCV of lysis buffer.
The cell suspension was drawn slowly into the syringe
with a narrow-gauge and then ejected with a single rapid
stroke. Repeated ten times to make sure cell lysis reached
80-90%, but the nucleus of lysed cells remained intact. The
disrupted cells in suspension were centrifuged for 20 min at
10,000–11,000 x g and the supernatant was the cytoplasmic
fraction. The crude nuclei pellet was washed 3 times by
lysis buffer and resuspended in 2/3 x PCV of extraction
buffer (20 mM HEPES, pH 7.9, with 1.5 mM MgCl2, 0.42
M NaCl, 0.2 mM EDTA, 25% (v/v) Glycerolc and, 1 mM
DTT). The nucleus suspension was shaken gently for 30
min and centrifuged for 20 min at 10,000-11,000 x g and
the supernatant was nuclear fraction.

Experimental design and statistical rationale
All experiments were performed in biological
triplicates. In one experiment, the forward and reverse
labeling was used to test the reliability of the quantitation
method. No significant differences were observed for
proteins identified with two or more unique peptides and
no other technique replicates were performed. Statistical
analysis was carried out with GraphPad Prism 5.0 software
on data related to cell proliferation assay, cell cytotoxicity
assay, PRM analysis and qPCR. Significant differences in
the data were determined by Student’s t test. P values of <
0.05 were considered significant.
