Abstract
Platinum-based chemotherapy is the ﬁrst-line treatment for non–small cell lung cancer, but recurrence occurs
in most patients. Recent evidence suggests that CD133þ cells are the cause of drug resistance and tumor
recurrence. However, the correlation between chemotherapy and regulation of CD133þ cells has not been
investigated methodically. In this study, we revealed that CD133þ lung cancer cells labeled by a human CD133
promoter–driven GFP reporter exhibited drug resistance and stem cell characteristics. Treatment of H460 and
H661 cell lines with low-dose cisplatin (IC20) was sufﬁcient to enrich CD133þ cells, to induce DNA damage
responses, and to upregulate ABCG2 and ABCB1 expression, which therefore increased the cross-resistance to
doxorubicin and paclitaxel. This cisplatin-induced enrichment of CD133þ cells was mediated through Notch
signaling as judged by increased levels of cleaved Notch1 (NICD1). Pretreatment with the g-secretase inhibitor,
N-[N-(3,5-diﬂuorophenacetyl)-1-alanyl]-S-phenylglycine t-butyl ester (DAPT), or Notch1 short hairpin RNAs
(shRNA) remarkably reduced the cisplatin-induced enrichment of CD133þ cells and increased the sensitivity to
doxorubicin and paclitaxel. Ectopic expression of NICD1 reversed the action of DAPT on drug sensitivity.
Immunohistochemistry showed that CD133þ cells were signiﬁcantly increased in the relapsed tumors in three of
six patients with lung cancer who have received cisplatin treatment. A similar effect was observed in animal
experiments as cisplatin treatment increased Notch1 cleavage and the ratio of CD133þ cells in engrafted tumors.
Intratumoral injection of DAPT with cisplatin treatment signiﬁcantly reduced CD133þ cell number. Together, our
results showed that cisplatin induces the enrichment of CD133þ cells, leading to multidrug resistance by the
activation of Notch signaling. Cancer Res; 73(1); 406–16. 2012 AACR.

Introduction
Non–small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) represents approximately 80% of all lung cancers, and platinum-based chemotherapy is the standard ﬁrst-line therapeutic approach to treat
patients with NSCLCs. However, the patients treated with
single modalities are at a high risk for local regional recurrence

and distant relapse (1). Over the past few decades, trials have
evaluated the beneﬁts of doublet chemotherapy by combination of cisplatin with other non-platinum drugs. Although the
overall median survival of the patients who received platinumbased therapy has reached 9 to 12 months (2), the chemoresistance of tumor cells continues to be a considerable challenge
in the management of NSCLCs. Tumor cells often show initial
sensitivity to chemotherapeutic drugs, but acquired resistance
develops during the treatment, leading to tumor recurrence and
further tumor progression. The most cited mechanism for the
acquisition of drug resistance is the active efﬂux of chemotherapeutic agents via ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters,
such as P-glycoprotein P-gp/MDR1/ABCB1, breast cancer resistance protein BCRP/ABCG2, and multidrug resistance proteins
(MRP; ref. 3). However, there is no effective treatment strategy
to override these transporters for clinical therapy. In addition,
several receptor-mediated survival signaling pathways, including mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), Akt, mTOR,
NF-kB, and Notch pathways, have been linked to the drug
resistance of conventional chemotherapy (4–6).
One emerging hypothesis that explains how cancer cells can
withstand therapeutic assaults, acquire resistance, and establish distant metastasis is the cancer stem cell (CSC) hypothesis.
The CSC hypothesis states that CSCs possess similar biologic
properties of normal stem cells, such as unlimited self-renewal,

Cisplatin Enriches CD133þ Cells via Notch Signaling

asymmetric cell division, and resistance to toxic agents partially attributed to the elevated expression of ABC transporters.
A recent study showed that expression of CD133 is associated
with the levels of resistance-related proteins in patients with
NSCLCs (7). Furthermore, a combination of CD133 and ABCG2
can be used as an independent predictor of postoperative
recurrence for patients with stage I NSCLCs (8). The mechanisms causing drug resistance in CSCs are still poorly understood; CSCs may be intrinsically resistant to chemotherapeutic
agents due to their low proliferation rate and resistance
mechanisms, such as the expression of ABC transporters (9).
Even though the origin of CSCs is unknown, there is a
consensus that CSCs reside in a niche that provides the
cells with elementary signals. Notch signaling is critical for
regulating cell-to-cell communication during embryogenesis,
cellular proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis (10). Activation of Notch signaling occurs when the Notch receptor
undergoes a conformational change that allows proteolytic
cleavage by g-secretase, releasing an intracellular domain
(NICD) that undergoes nuclear translocation and modulates
Notch-speciﬁc gene expression. Recently, inhibition of g-secretase–mediated Notch cleavage is a primary focus for the development of cancer therapeutics (11). Targeting CSCs with inhibitors of Notch signaling promotes cell differentiation, increases
sensitivity to chemotherapy, and reduces metastasis (12).
Although the drug action of cisplatin has been widely
explored (13), whether cisplatin may regulate the ratio of CSCs
and elicit further multidrug resistance in NSCLCs is still
unknown. Here, we provide evidence showing that cisplatin
treatment signiﬁcantly increased the ratio of CD133þ cells
through the Notch signaling pathway. The cisplatin-elevated
CD133þ cells were resistant to paclitaxel and doxorubicin by
expressing ABCB1 and ABCG2. In addition, the enrichment of
CD133þ cells by cisplatin was shown in a tumor-engrafted
mouse model and clinical specimens. Our data indicate that
exposure to cisplatin induced CSCs, leading to the increase of
multidrug resistance in NSCLCs, suggesting that a new therapeutic strategy may be necessary to prevent the production of
CSCs, whereas platinum-based chemotherapy is applied for
the management of NSCLCs.

Materials and Methods
Clinical specimens
We enrolled 6 patients with lung cancer diagnosed from 2010
through 2012 with adenocarcinoma or squamous cell carcinoma from Kaohsiung Medical University Chung-Ho Memorial
Hospital (KMUH; Kaohsiung, Taiwan) with approval of Institutional Review Board (KMUH-IRB-20120068). These patients
received combination chemotherapy of cisplatin with docetaxel, gemcitabine, vinorelbin, or pemetrexed for 4 to 6 cycles
according to the guideline of KMUH. The initial response of
these patients for the ﬁrst-line chemotherapy was from partial
response to stable disease when tumor recurrence occurred
within 1 year. All these patients received surgery or thoracoscopic biopsy for the relapsed tumor. The primary (before
cisplatin treatment) and relapsed (after cisplatin treatment)
tumors of each patient were parafﬁn-embedded, sectioned, and
used for evaluating CD133þ cells by immunohistochemistry.

Immunohistochemistry
Tissue sections (5 mm) were dewaxed and rehydrated.
Antigen retrieval was done by incubating the slides in 10
mmol/L citric buffer (pH 6.0) and microwaved for 15 minutes.
After blocking, the slides were incubated with primary antibody against CD133 followed by biotin-conjugated secondary
antibody, polymer horseradish peroxidase, and diaminobenzidine tetrahydroxychloride (DAB) solution.
Cell culture
The human NSCLC cell lines A549, H460, H1299, PC9, and
H661 were purchased from American Type Culture Collection.
A549, H1299, and PC9 cell lines were maintained in Dulbecco's
Modiﬁed Eagle Medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% FBS
(Invitrogen). H460 and H661 cell lines were maintained in
RPMI-1640 supplemented with 10% FBS. Cell lines were kept
under a humidiﬁed incubator containing 5% CO2 at 37 C. For
long-term culturing, mycoplasma test was conducted every
month for all cell lines.
Generation of plasmids and lentivirus preparation
The short hairpin RNAs (shRNA) targeting ABCB1 and
Notch1 were purchased from Invitrogen. The EF.hICN1.
CMV.GFP plasmid was a gift from Dr. Linzhao Cheng (Addgene
plasmid #17623). For generation of the human CD133 promoter construct (CD133-GFP reporter), chromosomal DNA was
isolated from HEK293T cells. The 50 -promoter P1 region of the
human prominin1 gene (CD133; GenBank accession number
AY275524) was generated by PCR ampliﬁcation cloned into
lentiviral vector pLL3.7 to replace the CMV promoter, which
drives EGFP expression.
Isolation of CD133þ cells and sphere-forming assay
H460 cells were infected by CD133 P1 promoter–driven GFP
reporter lentivirus and cultured in complete medium. The
GFPþ cells were sorted using a FACSAria cell sorter (BD
Biosciences). The GFPþ cells were expanded as spheres in a
10-cm ultra-low adhesion culture dish (Corning) containing
DMEM/F-12 with N2 supplement (Invitrogen), 20 ng/mL EGF,
and 20 ng/mL basic ﬁbroblast growth factor (FGF; PeproTech),
referred to stem cell medium, for 2 weeks. The tumor sphere
formation efﬁciency was calculated as the ratio of sphere
number to the plated cell number.
Quantitative real-time PCR
Total RNA isolation and reverse transcription were conducted
using the method as described previously (14). The mRNA
expression of CD133, Oct4, b-catenin, Bmi-1, Smo, Notch1, Nestin,
Nanog, Sox2, ABCG2, ABCB1, hHes-1, and GAPDH was analyzed
by quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR). The PCR for each gene
was conducted for 20 seconds at 95 C, followed by 40 cycles at
95 C for 3 seconds and annealing at 60 C for 30 seconds. The
results were normalized to those of the housekeeping gene
glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH).
Flow cytometry
After cisplatin treatment for 24 hours, cultures from the
H460 and H661 cell lines were washed with PBS. For some

experiments, single cells dissociated from tumor spheres were
analyzed by this method. One million trypsinized cells were
incubated with an anti-CD133 antibody (Cell Signaling Technology Inc.) or isotype control IgG (Upstate Biotechnology) for
45 minutes. After washing, the cells were incubated with an
Alexa488/Alexa594-conjugated secondary antibody (Invitrogen) for 30 minutes and washed again before analysis using
a BD FACScaliber ﬂow cytometer (BD Biosciences). The ﬂuorescent intensities were analyzed with Cell Quest Software (BD
Biosciences).
Western blot
For Western blot analysis, cells were harvested and lysed
in 1 RIPA buffer containing protease inhibitor cocktails
(Roche). The detail protocol for Western blotting and the
antibodies used in this study are described in Supplementary
Materials and Methods.
Soft agar assay
A soft agar assay was conducted on 6-well plates with a base
layer of 0.5% agarose gel containing DMEM and an upper layer
of 0.35% agarose gel with DMEM/F-12 medium containing N2
supplement, 20 ng/mL EGF, and 20 ng/mL basic FGF.
Xenograft tumor growth
Nude mice (6–8 weeks old, male, 20 to 25 g body weight) were
obtained from the National Laboratory Animal Center. Animal
care was provided in accordance with the Laboratory Animal
Welfare Act, Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals
approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee
of National Cheng Kung University (Tainan, Taiwan).
Immunoﬂuorescence assay
After the tumors were removed from xenografted mice, half
of each tumor was ﬁxed in 4% formalin at 4 C overnight. The
immunoﬂuorescence was conducted using anti-CD133 antibody and anti-cleaved Notch1 antibody.
Statistical analysis
Data are presented as the mean  SE. To analyze the
triplicate results of the experiments, 2-tailed Student t test
was used to show signiﬁcant differences.
Additional information is described in Supplementary Materials and Methods.

Results
CD133þ cells isolated from the H460 cell line display the
characteristics of CSCs
Studies have shown that CD133þ cells in different lung
cancer cell lines exhibit self-renewal and tumor-initiating
abilities. To isolate CD133-expressing cells, we constructed a
human CD133 P1 promoter–driven GFP reporter into the
PLL3.7 lentiviral vector (Fig. 1A). After infection, 1.5%  0.5%
GFPþ cells were identiﬁed in the H460 cell line (Supplementary
Fig. S1A). The GFPþ cells were sorted and cultured in ultra-low
adhesion culture dishes containing stem cell medium, which
allowed the cells to grow as tumor spheres and maintain GFP
expression (Fig. 1B). Higher expression levels of CD133 protein

408

Cancer Res; 73(1) January 1, 2013

and mRNA in GFPþ cells were conﬁrmed by Western blotting
and qPCR (Fig. 1C and D). Flow cytometry showed that the
CD133 antibody recognized the membrane-bound CD133 protein and identiﬁed more than 70% GFPþ cells as CD133þ cells
(Fig. 1E). Next, we analyzed the cellular properties of the GFPþ
cells. The GFPþ cells proliferated slower than GFP- cells in
complete medium containing 10% FBS (Fig. 1F), suggesting
that differentiation of GFPþ cells may occur after serum
stimulation. Indeed, the GFPþ cells cultured in serum-containing medium gradually lose their GFP expression within 2 weeks
(Supplementary Fig. S1B). Functional assay showed that the
GFPþ cells displayed greater sphere-forming ability, cisplatin
resistance, and migration ability (Fig. 1G and 1H; Supplementary Fig. S1C). We next analyzed the expression of stemnessassociated genes in GFPþ cells by qPCR. As shown in Fig. 1I, the
GFPþ cells expressed higher mRNA levels of stem cell–associated genes, including Oct4, Sox2, Nanog, Smo, Bmi1, b-catenin,
Nestin, and Notch1. After serum-triggered differentiation of
GFPþ cells for 2 weeks, the GFP-diminished cells were sorted
and subjected to qPCR analysis. The results showed that the
expression of stemness-associated genes in differentiated
GFPþ cells was signiﬁcantly decreased when compared with
undifferentiated GFPþ cells (Fig. 1J). Our data conﬁrmed the
existence of CD133þ cells in the H460 cell line with a CD133
antibody and CD133 promoter–driven GFP reporter lentivirus.
The CD133þ cells were also characterized as CSCs.
Cisplatin treatment elevates the ratio of CD133þ cell
To study whether cisplatin may elevate the ratio of CSCs in
lung cancer, we ﬁrst tested the cytotoxic effect of cisplatin in
NSCLC cell lines. Two lung cancer cell lines, H460 and H661,
were treated with different concentrations of cisplatin for 24
and 48 hours, and cell viability was determined by MTT assay
(Fig. 2A). Cisplatin-induced DNA damage was conﬁrmed by the
activation of DNA damage sensors, including cleaved PARP
and phospho-gH2AX as well as the transducer phospho-CHK1,
which leads to the elevation of p53 expression (Fig. 2B).
According to the results from the cytotoxic analysis of cisplatin, H460 and H661 cells were treated with 10 mmol/L and 2
mmol/L cisplatin for 24 hours, respectively, which are sufﬁcient
to induce DNA damage but not signiﬁcant cell death (IC20)
for the following experiments. As shown in Fig. 2C, cisplatin
treatment for 24 hours remarkably increased the percentage of
CD133þ cells in H460 and H661 cell cultures. This cisplatininduced enrichment of CD133þ cells was in a dose- and timedependent manner (Supplementary Fig. S2A and S2B). In
addition to H460 and H661, this phenomenon could be
observed in another cell lines, including H1299, A549, and PC9
(Supplementary Fig. S2C). In addition to cisplatin, carboplatin
is also used as a platinum-based chemotherapy agent for
NSCLCs, especially for the patients with chronic renal diseases.
We found that carboplatin treatment also triggered DNA
damage and induced enrichment of CD133þ cells in H460 cell
cultures (Supplementary Fig. S3).
Aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) has been reported as
another lung CSC marker (15), and we found that cisplatin
treatment also increased the ratio of ALDHþ cells in H460
cell cultures (Supplementary Fig. S4). As expected, the stem

and the multidrug-resistant genes ABCG2 and ABCB1 were
upregulated in cisplatin-primed H460 and H661 cultures (Fig.
2D). Next, we tested whether cisplatin treatment could
increase the ratio of the cells with stem cell properties. After
cisplatin treatment for 24 hours, the remaining cells were
subjected to the tumor sphere and soft agar colony-forming
assays. Compared with vehicle controls, the cisplatin-treated
cells generated more tumor spheres (Fig. 2E) and colonies in
soft agar cultures (Fig. 2F). Next, to show whether the increase
of stem cell–associated genes was speciﬁcally expressed in
CD133þ cells, CD133, and CD133þ cells were sorted from the
cisplatin-treated H460 cell line. The purity of the sorted cells
was conﬁrmed by ﬂow cytometry and Western blotting (Fig.
2G). Results from qPCR showed that the stem cell–associated
genes were highly expressed in the CD133þ cells, whereas the
CD133 cells showed a similar expression pattern with the
parental cells (Fig. 2H). Collectively, these results indicated that

cisplatin elevated the ratio of CD133þ cells, which displayed
stem cell properties.
Cisplatin-induced CD133þ cells display multidrug
resistance
ABCB1 and ABCG2 mediate the drug resistance of cancers
for a range of chemotherapy drugs, including paclitaxel and
doxorubicin (16). In our results, cisplatin-induced CD133þ cells
expressed higher levels of ABCB1 and ABCG2 mRNA (Fig. 2D
and H). Thus, we hypothesized that the cisplatin-induced
enrichment of CSCs may display multidrug resistance. By
treating with doxorubicin at different concentrations for 48
hours, the vehicle control in H460 cells had an IC50 of 90.9  8.2
nmol/L, but cisplatin-treated cells showed an IC50 of more than
500 nmol/L (Fig. 3A). In addition to doxorubicin, cisplatinprimed cells also exhibited drug resistance to paclitaxel treatment (Supplementary Fig. S5A). Pretreatment with 5 mmol/L

blocked cisplatin-induced protection to doxorubicin treatment in H460 cells (Fig. 3B). On the other hand, pretreatment
with 5 mmol/L verapamil, a pan-inhibitor for ABC transporters,
completely inhibited cisplatin-induced doxorubicin resistance
of H460 cells (Fig. 3C). These results suggested that cisplatininduced ABCG2, but not ABCB1, expression in CD133þ
-enriched cultures leads to drug resistance to doxorubicin
treatment. This conclusion was further conﬁrmed by the
observation that ABCB1 knockdown by speciﬁc shRNAs (Fig.
3D) did not reverse the cisplatin-induced doxorubicin resistance (Fig. 3E). In contrast to the role of ABCG2 in doxorubicin
resistance, pantoprazol partially reversed cisplatin-induced

ited the effect of cisplatin on H460 and H661 cells, suggesting
that not only ABCG2 but also other ABC transporters may be
involved in cisplatin-induced multidrug resistance (Supplementary Fig. S5B and S5C). Interestingly, although doxorubicin
alone at IC20 concentration was sufﬁcient to induce DNA
damage but little effect was observed on CD133þ cell enrichment (Fig. 3F). In addition, cotreatment of cisplatin and
doxorubicin did not have an additional effect on regulating
the ratio of CD133þ cell in the H460 culture, suggesting that the
induction of CD133þ cells was mediated by the mechanisms
speciﬁcally triggered by cisplatin but not by doxorubicin. On
the other hand, cisplatin combined with paclitaxel is one of the
current therapies for NSCLCs. However, paclitaxel alone or

cotreatment of cisplatin and paclitaxel had no further induction effect on the enrichment of CD133þ cells (Supplementary
Fig. S5D). Collectively, we concluded that cisplatin treatment
induced DNA damage and triggered CD133þ cell enrichment.
Cisplatin-induced enrichment of CD133þ cells is
mediated by Notch1 signaling
A number of studies have shown that activation of Notch
signaling maintains stemness and the self-renewal ability of
normal stem cells and CSCs (15, 17). Inhibition of Notch
signaling promotes differentiation of CSCs (18). Although
cisplatin-induced Notch1 expression and activation have been
discussed in some cancer types (19), studies on the correlation
between cisplatin and Notch signaling in lung cancer are
lacking. Thus, we were interested in investigating whether the
increase of CD133þ cells by cisplatin treatment is mediated by
Notch signaling in lung cancer cells. As shown in Fig. 4A,
treatment of cisplatin dose dependently increased Notch1
cleavage and activated it downstream target gene, Hes-1 (Fig.
4C). In contrast, the level of cleaved Notch3 was not altered by

www.aacrjournals.org

cisplatin treatment, suggesting that Notch1 activation may
play a major role on cisplatin-induced enrichment of CD133þ
cells (Supplementary Fig. S6A). Pretreatment with g-secretase
inhibitor, DAPT, abolished cisplatin-induced Notch1 activation (Fig. 4B) as well as the mRNA expression of Hes-1 (Fig. 4C).
DAPT only did not alter the ratio of CD133þ cells in the H460

pretreatment of DAPT signiﬁcantly inhibited cisplatininduced enrichment of CD133þ cells in H460 (Fig. 4D) and
H661 cells (Supplementary Fig. S7A). On the other hand,
shRNAs speciﬁcally targeting Notch1 greatly blocked cisplatin-induced enrichment of CD133þ cells (Supplementary Fig.
S6B and S6C). These results indicated that Notch1 plays an
important role in mediating the cisplatin-induced enrichment
of CD133þ cells. Next, we analyzed whether inhibition of
Notch signaling could block cisplatin-induced multidrug resistance to paclitaxel. Treatment of DAPT did not affect paclitaxel-induced cell death in H460 cells (vehicle: IC50 ¼ 4.2  0.3
nmol/L; DAPT: IC50 ¼ 2.7  1.0 nmol/L), but pretreatment
of DAPT signiﬁcantly blocked cisplatin-induced paclitaxel

Cisplatin treatment increases the ratio of CD133þ cells in
lung tumor of patients and in H460-xenografted nude

Accumulating evidences have shown a tumor regrowth cell
hierarchy originating with the survived CSCs after chemotherapy. According to the results from our in vitro study, we
assumed that CD133þ cells might increase in relapse tumors
of the patients who received cisplatin as their ﬁrst chemotherapy. We enrolled 6 patients with lung cancer with resected
tumor (before) and who received cisplatin as their ﬁrst chemotherapy. All these patients experienced tumor recurrence

and received surgery or endoscopy for the relapsed tumors
(after). Tumor samples, before and after cisplatin treatment,
were parafﬁn-embedded and sectioned. The expression of
CD133 was examined by immunohistochemistry. As shown
in Fig. 5A, CD133 staining signal can be detected in the tumor
region but not in the surrounding normal tissue. Few of
CD133þ cells could be detected in the primary tumor (before
cisplatin treatment), but the CD133 intensity and the number

of CD133þ cells dramatically increased in the recurrent tumors
(after cisplatin treatment) in 3 of 6 enrolled patients (Fig. 5A).
To evaluate the effect of cisplatin on the regulation of
CD133þ cell number in vivo, H460 cells were subcutaneously
injected into 22 nude mice. When the tumor grew to an appropriate size, the mice were divided into 4 groups according
to the treatments described in Materials and Methods. The
mice were sacriﬁced at day 4, and the ratio of CD133þ cells and

expression of cleaved Notch1 within the tumors were analyzed
using double immunoﬂuorescence. As shown in Fig. 5B, CD133þ
cells and cleaved Notch1 expression were rarely seen in vehicleand DAPT-treated tumors. Consistent with the results from
in vitro study, CD133 and cleaved Notch1 signals were dramatically increased in cisplatin-treated tumors. In addition, the
CD133 signals were colocalized with cleaved Notch1 signals. The
induction of CD133þ cells and Notch1 activation by cisplatin
treatment was inhibited by cotreatment with DAPT (Fig. 5B).
Quantiﬁcation analysis by ﬂow cytometry showed that cisplatin
signiﬁcantly elevated the number of CD133þ cells as compared
with HBSS control groups, (19.5%  3.8% vs. 5.2%  1.5%,
P < 0.01). Furthermore, cotreatment of DAPT blocked cisplatininduced CD133þ cells and resulted in a similar ratio of CD133þ
cells as compared with DAPT control groups (7.1%  1.9% vs.
7.0%  0.8%, P ¼ 0.42; Fig. 5C and D). Together, our studies
showed that cisplatin elevated the ratio of CD133þ cells through
Notch1 signaling, leading to multidrug resistance.

Discussion
Platinum-based combination chemotherapy is the standard
ﬁrst-line treatment for advanced NSCLCs. Despite the relevance of ﬁrst-line chemotherapy, tumor recurrence occurs in
most cases (20). In addition, the use of second-line agents, such
as docetaxel and pemetrexed, is not efﬁcacious in patients who
had already received these drugs in ﬁrst-line chemotherapy
(21). Here, we provide direct evidence that cisplatin treatment
elevated the ratio of CD133þ cells, which exhibited stem-like
properties and cross-drug resistance to paclitaxel. Our in vitro
and in vivo studies also suggested that Notch signaling is
involved in this cisplatin-triggered CSC transition. Our data
partially explained the high recurrence rate and drug resistance to second-line chemotherapy in cisplatin-treated
patients with NSCLCs.
Accumulating evidence has shown that CSCs may not only
originate from the transformation of normal stem cells but also
arise from the dedifferentiation of cancer cells (22). An impressive observation has shown that CSCs exist in single cancer
cell–derived cultures, which reveals the ﬂexibility of the cancer
cell status in tumors due to genomic instability in cancer cells
(23, 24). In addition, the dedifferentiation of cancer cells can be
induced by different environmental cues, such as inﬂammation, hypoxia, and serum deprivation, through epigenetic or
genetic regulation (25). Recently, epithelial-to-mesenchymal
transition (EMT) has been broadly showed to convert mature
cancer cells into CSCs (26, 27), which is mediated by EMTassociated genes and microRNAs (28–30). In our study, we
showed that treatment with cisplatin elevated CD133þ cells in
the H460 and H661 cell lines. This induction effect could not
have resulted from eliminating CD133 cells, which are more
sensitive to cisplatin, and preserving the existing CD133þ cells
before treatment because limited cells were killed by a low dose
of cisplatin around the IC20 for each cell line during treatment.
On the other hand, a high-dose treatment (>IC50) of paclitaxel,
which induced signiﬁcant cell death, showed no effect on
regulating CD133þ cell number in the H460 and H661 cell
lines. These results indicated that cisplatin might induce
dedifferentiation of NSCLCs.

Cancer cells are considered to be more genetically unstable,
which can be accelerated by exogenous and endogenous
exposures that cause DNA damage, such as irradiation and
chemotherapy (31). A previous study showed that DNA damage induced by UV light and mitomycin C increased the side
population in human nasopharyngeal carcinoma and CD133þ
cells in human neuroblastoma SKN-SH cells (24). In our study,
we showed that cisplatin-induced DNA damage could be
another driving force that triggers the enrichment of H460
and H661 cells. In addition, the biologic relevance of the DNA
damage recognition proteins may not be limited to the induction of apoptosis. Exposure to cisplatin elicits prosurvival and
pro-apoptotic signals simultaneously, suggesting that the DNA
damage induced by cisplatin may trigger different downstream
signaling pathways to determine the ﬁnal fate of cells.
So far, the cisplatin-activated signaling pathways have
not been fully addressed. Two phosphatidylinositol-3-related
kinases, ATM (ataxia telangiectasia mutated) and ATR (ATMRad3-related), are located at the top of checkpoint signal
cascades. Of these 2 kinases, cisplatin preferentially activates
ATR kinase and its downstream CHK1 kinase (32). Recently,
CHK1-mediated activation of MAPK has been linked to cisplatin-induced cellular effects. All 3 members of MAPK, extracellular signal–regulated kinase (ERK), c-jun-NH2 terminal
kinase (JNK), and p38 kinase, are activated following the
exposure of tumor cells to cisplatin, and ERK activation is the
most critical for cisplatin-induced apoptosis (33). However,
additional research suggested that the activation of ERK and
the JNK/MAPK cascade by cisplatin prevents tumor cells from
undergoing apoptosis (34), reﬂecting that different cell contexts and the degree of DNA damage may cause different
cellular effects. Furthermore, activation of ERK signaling has
been shown to be involved in the dedifferentiation of myogenic
lineage–committed human myoblasts (35).
Notch1 is important for the maintenance and self-renewal of
cancer-initiating cells in different malignancies (15, 36, 37).
Inhibition of Notch signaling promotes differentiation and the
radio- and chemotherapy of CSCs (38). In contrast, overexpression of Notch1 promotes EMT and the number of CSCs in
pancreatic cancer. We found that inhibition of Notch signaling
by pretreatment with the g-secretase inhibitor, DAPT, significantly blocked the cisplatin-induced elevation of CD133þ cells
in vitro and in vivo. Although the mechanism of how cisplatininduced DNA damage activates Notch signaling is unclear,
there is evidence showing that the expression and activation of
Notch1 can be controlled by p53 (39). In addition, Notch1
exerts a p53-dependent protective function against DNA damage in response to UVB light through suppression of Forkhead
box O3 (FOXO3), a key pro-apoptotic gene (40). Accordingly,
these studies designate that the cisplatin-induced upregulation and activation of Notch1 may be the consequence of
elevated p53 caused by DNA damage.
ABCB1 and ABCG2 are 2 well-known multidrug resistant
genes, which were upregulated in CD133þ cells. Our study
showed that cisplatin-induced multidrug resistance was
through the expression of ABCG2 and ABCB1 in CD133þ cells.
Consistently, it has been reported that high expression level of
ABCG2 protein is correlated with poor survival and lower

response rate of the patients with NSCLCs who received
platinum-based chemotherapy (41–43). In addition, dual
CD133þ/ABCG2þ status can be an independent predictor
of tumor recurrence for the patients with stage I NSCLCs (8).
In vitro study showed that ABCG2-overexpressing human
NSCLC cell lines were more resistant to chemotherapy (44,
45). Inhibition of ABCG2 and/or ABCB1 by selective inhibitors sensitized NSCLCs to chemotherapy (46, 47). More
studies are required to investigate whether blockage of
Notch signaling may decrease the expression of ABCG2 and
ABCB1 and resensitize cancer cells to platinum-based chemotherapy.
Collectively, we provided evidence showing that cisplatininduced DNA damage enriched CD133þ cells. Elevation of
CD133þ cells is related to the increase in cross-drug resistance
to paclitaxel. We also showed that the induction of CD133þ
cells by cisplatin was mediated by Notch signaling. Thus, our
data not only provided the possible mechanism of tumor
recurrence in cisplatin-treated patients with lung cancer but
also suggested that blocking Notch signaling during ﬁrst-line
treatment may reduce the recurrence of NSCLCs.
