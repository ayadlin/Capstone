Abstract
The phenotypic switching called epithelial-to-mesenchymal
transition is frequently associated with epithelial tumor cell
progression from a comparatively benign to an aggressive,
invasive malignancy. Coincident with the emergence of such
cellular plasticity is an altered response to transforming
growth factor-B (TGF-B) as well as epidermal growth factor
(EGF) receptor amplification. TGF-B in the tumor microenvironment promotes invasive traits largely through reprogramming gene expression, which paradoxically supports
matrix-disruptive as well as stabilizing processes. ras-transformed HaCaT II-4 keratinocytes undergo phenotypic changes
typical of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, acquire a
collagenolytic phenotype, and effectively invade collagen type
1 gels as a consequence of TGF-B1 + EGF stimulation in a
three-dimensional physiologically relevant model system that
monitors collagen remodeling. Enhanced collagen degradation was coupled to a significant increase in matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-10 expression and involved a proteolytic
axis composed of plasmin, MMP-10, and MMP-1. Neutralization of any one component in this cascade inhibited collagen
gel lysis. Similarly, addition of plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1 (SERPINE1) blocked collagen degradation as well
as the conversion of both proMMP-10 and proMMP-1 to their
catalytically active forms. This study therefore identifies an
important mechanism in TGF-B1 + EGF-initiated collagen
remodeling by transformed human keratinocytes and proposes a crucial upstream role for plasminogen activator
inhibitor type 1–dependent regulation in this event. [Cancer

Introduction
Epithelial tumor progression, from a relatively indolent to a
more aggressive phenotype, is frequently accompanied by acquisition of a plastic phenotype reminiscent of a developmental
program called epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT; ref. 1).
This process is typified by loss of normal epithelial properties
(e.g., cell polarity and junctional complexes) and a gain in
mesenchymal traits (expression of vimentin and smooth muscle
actin and enhanced cell motility; ref. 2). Although essential during

embryonic development, EMT is relatively limited in the adult
organism, occurring during wound repair or, more atypically, in
advanced pathologies largely in response to specific growth factors
associated with tumor progression (3–5). Epidermal growth factor
(EGF) receptor amplification and an altered cellular response to
transforming growth factor-h (TGF-h), for example, accompany
the progression of epithelial tumor cells from a benign phenotype
to an aggressive, metastatic carcinoma (6–8). During this
pathologic EMT, and despite increased autocrine/paracrine expression of TGF-h, cells become refractory to the normally growthsuppressive effects of TGF-h family members. Mouse models of
multistage skin carcinogenesis support the concept that TGF-h
functions as a tumor suppressor in the early stages of benign
growth; in late stage tumors, however, TGF-h accelerates malignant
conversion (6). Down-regulation of TGF-h receptors, alterations in
TGF-h-dependent Smad signaling components, or a combination
of both appear to contribute to this functional switch (8, 9).
TGF-h likely promotes tumor-invasive properties through
expression of genes that encode stromal remodeling proteins,
which paradoxically support matrix-disruptive as well as stabilizing
processes. Structural extracellular matrix proteins such as fibronectin and collagen (10, 11) are up-regulated by TGF-h in conjunction with their proteolytic regulators, including plasminogen
activator inhibitor type 1 (PAI-1; ref. 12) and matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-1, -3, -9, -10, -11, and -13 (13–15). Similar to TGF-h,
EGF-dependent signaling contributes to up-regulation of several
MMPs (15–19) and is enhanced through increased receptor levels
in various cancers (7).
Stringent temporal and spatial controls on MMP activation are
essential for maintaining tissue homeostasis. In addition to
transcriptional regulation, MMP-dependent activities are also
modulated through proteolytic activation (20). Proteolytic cascades
within the pericellular environment are largely initiated through
conversion of matrix plasminogen to the broad-spectrum protease
plasmin, which, in turn, directly converts several proMMPs to their
active form and triggers a positive feedback mechanism for MMP
activation (21). Indeed, regulation of plasminogen activation may
substantially affect MMP-dependent remodeling processes and
thereby cellular invasive traits. The ability of TGF-h and/or EGF
stimulation to also up-regulate PAI-1 in several cell types (this
study; refs. 12, 22) provides a potential mechanism for upstream
negative regulation or titration of the MMP cascade.
The immortalized adult human keratinocyte cell line HaCaT (23)
harbors genetic changes similar to those that accompany progression of a normal keratinocyte to an invasive squamous cell carcinoma (24). Stimulation of activated ras-expressing HaCaT II-4
cells with TGF-h alone or, more effectively, a combination of TGFh1 and EGF promotes a highly plastic phenotype typified by loss
of E-cadherin and de novo synthesis of N-cadherin and vimentin

(4, 25). The ability of TGF-h1 and/or EGF to elicit EMT-related
responses such as these in a more physiologically significant
model, however, has not been explored. This article describes the
use of a three-dimensional collagen gel system to evaluate
proteolytic events associated with TGF-h1 + EGF-stimulated EMT
and collagen invasion by HaCaT II-4 keratinocytes. The invasive
potential of these keratinocytes was coupled to a plasmin/MMP-10/
MMP-1–dependent collagen-remodeling axis, and a role for PAI-1
as a critical upstream regulator of this remodeling process was
established.

Materials and Methods
Reagents. Vitrogen (Cohesion Technologies) or PureCol (Inamed;
Advanced BioMatrix) provided sources of bovine collagen type 1. Both
products yielded comparable results and were used interchangeably. Where
indicated, FITC-labeled collagen type 1 (Sigma-Aldrich) or DQ FITC-labeled
collagen type 1 (Molecular Probes/Invitrogen) were added to monitor gel
degradation. Recombinant human TGF-h1 (R&D Systems) was used at
1 ng/mL and recombinant human EGF (Upstate/Millipore) at 10 ng/mL.
Plasminogen, aprotinin, E-64, amiloride, o-phenylenediamine dihydrochloride, hydrogen peroxide, and phosphate-citrate buffer were from SigmaAldrich. Recombinant human PAI-1 protein and a2-antiplasmin were from
Calbiochem. GM6001 was obtained from Chemicon/Millipore and AG1478
was obtained from Biosource International/Invitrogen. Immunofluorescence antibodies included tubulin (clone DM1A; Sigma), vimentin (LN6 Ab1; Calbiochem), E-cadherin (clone 36), and N-cadherin (clone 32) from BD
Biosciences; MMP-10 from Santa Cruz Biotechnology; and 4¶,6-diamidino2-phenylindole stain, phalloidin-594, and Cell Tracker CMTPX from
Molecular Probes/Invitrogen. For Western blotting, antibodies to MMP-1
and MMP-10 or biotinylated antibodies to MMP-1 and MMP-10 were
obtained from R&D Systems; antibodies to actin or extracellular signalregulated kinase 1/2 were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Antibodies
against human plasminogen and PAI-1 (neutralizing) were from American
Diagnostica. Neutralizing antibodies to MMP-1 and MMP-10 were obtained
from R&D Systems. A polyclonal antibody to PAI-1 was used for ELISA and
immunofluorescence. Unless otherwise indicated, Alexa Fluor 488 (green)
or 594 (red) conjugates (Molecular Probes/Invitrogen) were used for
immunocytochemistry detection; horseradish peroxidase conjugates (Pierce
Biotechnology) were used for Western blot and ELISA analyses.
Cell culture. HaCaT II-4 keratinocytes were maintained in low-glucose
DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Life Technologies/
Invitrogen). Cells were harvested with trypsin/EDTA, washed with PBS,
and seeded onto collagen in serum-free Advanced DMEM overnight before
stimulation with TGF-h1 and/or EGF. Phenol red-free medium (Life Technologies/Invitrogen) was used in fluorescence assays.
Collagen gel-based studies. Collagen type 1 was neutralized according
to the manufacturer’s instructions using 10 PBS and 0.1 N NaOH and then
diluted to 1.8 mg/mL (unless stated otherwise) with DMEM. Gels were
polymerized in 48-well tissue culture plates (150 AL), OptiCell Chambers
(1.0 mL; USA Scientific), MatTek glass bottom dishes (200 AL; MatTek), or
onto cell culture inserts (20 AL, 700 Ag/mL) at 37jC for 2 to 3 h. For
OptiCell-based invasion assays, 2  105 cells were added in 1 mL Advanced
DMEM to gels polymerized vertically within the chamber. Cells were viewed
on an inverted Olympus IX70 by laying the chamber on its side and images
were captured with Image-Pro Plus software. For Transwell invasion
assays, 1  105 cells were seeded onto thin collagen gels in Advanced
DMEM. Invading cells were visualized with 4¶,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole
and counted in four random fields. For collagen gel dissolution assays,
5  104 cells were seeded onto polymerized gels in Advanced DMEM;
plasminogen (5-20 Ag/mL) was added 24 to 48 h post-growth factor
stimulation for up to 24 h. Cells were pretreated with inhibitors or neutralizing antibodies as indicated. In experiments with anti-PAI-1 neutralizing antibody, time (not shown) and/or plasminogen concentration were
reduced to capture differences in the state of dissolution with increas-

ing antibody concentration. Cells on intact gels were fixed in 3% paraformaldehyde before viewing on an inverted Olympus IX70 microscope.
To quantify collagen degradation, FITC-labeled collagen (25 Ag/mL) was
incorporated into polymerized gels. Cells were stimulated in phenol red-free
DMEM and incubated with plasminogen for 7.5 h and 100 AL conditioned
medium was removed for fluorescence spectroscopy using Synergy HT
microplate reader equipped with KC4 software (BioTek Instruments).
Microscopy. HaCaT II-4 cells were seeded onto collagen-coated coverslips
(50 Ag/mL) or onto collagen gels polymerized in MatTek glass-bottomed
dishes. Following treatment, cells were fixed in 3% paraformaldehyde,
permeabilized, blocked, and incubated with primary and secondary
antibodies for 1 h each. Coverslips were mounted using ProLong Gold with
4¶,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole and viewed on an Olympus BX61 microscope
with Image-Pro Lab software version 3.6.5. or an Olympus IX70 inverted scope
with Image-Pro Plus software. For visualization of collagen digestion, cells
were seeded onto coverslips coated with collagen type 1 (50 Ag/mL) + DQ
FITC-labeled collagen type 1 (25 Ag/mL).
Protein analysis. Collagen gels were digested with collagenase D; cells
were separated from digested collagen by centrifugation and lysed in a
50 mmol/L HEPES containing 150 mmol/L NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5%
deoxycholate, 1% NP-40, 10 mmol/L NaF, 1 mmol/L orthovanadate,
and protease inhibitors; and extracts were probed for N-cadherin and
E-cadherin. Western blot analysis of MMP-1 and MMP-10 used conditioned
medium from cells stimulated with TGF-h1 + EGF followed by incubation
with plasminogen F inhibitors (as indicated). The Human MMP Antibody
Array 1.1 from RayBio (RayBiotech) was used to detect changes in MMP
protein levels in conditioned medium. For measurement of PAI-1 levels by
ELISA, 1.2  105 cells seeded on collagen type 1-coated, BSA-blocked wells
were maintained under serum-free conditions for 6 h, pretreated with
AG1478, as indicated, and then stimulated with TGF-h1 and/or EGF
overnight. Cells were fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde, permeabilized,
blocked, and incubated with PAI-1 polyclonal antibodies for 1 h followed by
a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody. Cell layer PAI-1
was detected by colorimetric assay using an o-phenylenediamine dihydrochloride substrate and measured by spectrophotometer at 492 nm. Results
were normalized to cell number by measuring the level of cell-associated
crystal violet staining.
Statistical analysis. The Student’s t test for two samples, assuming
unequal variance, was used to compare conditions within a group. Twotailed values with P V 0.05 were considered significant.

Results
HaCaT II-4 keratinocytes stimulated with TGF-B1 + EGF
undergo EMT and invade collagen gels in a MMP-dependent
manner. To recapitulate events associated with cutaneous EMT in
a relevant context, p53 mutant, Ha-ras-expressing human keratinocytes (HaCaT II-4 cells; ref. 23) were cultured on a collagen coat
(Fig. 1A) or onto a more physiologically related three-dimensional
collagen gel (Fig. 1B and C) and simultaneously treated with TGFh1 and EGF to mimic the increased TGF-h expression/EGF
receptor signaling characteristics of late-stage tumors. Under these
conditions, EGF stimulation was mitogenic, whereas TGF-h1
maintained its growth-suppressive activity even in the presence
of EGF (Supplementary Fig. S1). Whereas HaCaT II-4 colonies
cultured on a three-dimensional collagen gel appeared more
compact than cells cultured on a collagen coat, dually stimulated
cells displayed traits typical of an EMT (2) on both substrates
including increased scattering (Fig. 1A and B; tubulin), de novo
vimentin, and N-cadherin expression (Fig. 1A–C) as well as loss of
E-cadherin at cell-cell junctions (Fig. 1A–C). To our knowledge,
these observations represent the first evidence that EMT-related
events take place in human keratinocytes cultured in a threedimensional environment.

Because the phenotypic plasticity characteristic of EMT may
promote tumor metastasis (5), it was important to evaluate the
invasive capacities of TGF-h1 + EGF-treated HaCaT II-4 cells.
TGF-h1 + EGF enhanced cell invasion and migration into a
collagen matrix, as assessed in both OptiCell and Transwell three-

dimensional systems (Fig. 2A and B), and was effectively attenuated by the broad-spectrum MMP inhibitor GM6001 (Fig. 2C).
Confocal imagery of cells seeded onto thin collagen gels (Supplementary Fig. S2) also supported the observation that TGF-h1 +
EGF promoted HaCaT II-4 collagen gel invasion. Enhanced

PAI-1 Regulates MMP-10–Initiated Collagen Remodeling

collagen type 1 degradation following TGF-h1 + EGF treatment was
confirmed by using collagen matrices prepared from a quenched
FITC-labeled collagen type 1 substrate that fluoresces on cleavage
(Fig. 2D). Together, these data indicate that TGF-h1 and EGF play
integral roles in modulating HaCaT II-4-based collagenase activity,
effectively supporting collagen gel invasion.
TGF-B1 + EGF treatment enhances collagen degradation via
a plasmin/MMP dependent mechanism. Physiologic control of
pericellular proteolysis occurs primarily through the regulation of
plasminogen activation at the cell surface, which, in turn,
contributes to downstream extracellular MMP activity (Fig. 3A).
To explore the mechanisms associated with plasmin-based
proteolysis in a cutaneous model, exogenous plasminogen was
added to HaCaT II-4 cultures stimulated with TGF-h1 and/or EGF,
as HaCaT II-4 cells secrete only low levels of plasminogen (Fig. 3A).
Dissolution of the supporting collagen matrix accompanied TGFh1 + EGF + plasminogen treatment (Fig. 3B), a process significantly
reduced by the plasmin inhibitors aprotinin and a2-antiplasmin,
but not with the cysteine protease inhibitor E-64 (Fig. 3C and D),
which affects cellular cathepsins. Inhibition of MMP activity with
GM6001 also blocked plasmin-initiated collagen degradation,
confirming a role for MMPs in the remodeling process (Figs. 2D
and 3C and D). Control experiments revealed no evidence of
adverse effects arising from treatment with these inhibitors (data
not shown). Cells that were detached as a result of collagen
gel dissolution, in fact, reattached to tissue culture wells within
24 h (Supplementary Fig. S3).
Plasmin-dependent collagen degradation was quantified through
the release of digested FITC-labeled collagen type 1 (Fig. 3D).
Stimulation with either TGF-h1 or EGF independently significantly
increased collagen type 1 proteolysis within 7.5 h of plasminogen
addition. This by itself, however, was insufficient to trigger a
distinguishable loss in the fibrillar network even at later time
points (Fig. 3B). Stimulation with the combination of TGF-h1 +
EGF clearly evoked a more substantial proteolytic response
(Fig. 3D) that resulted in dissolution of the polymerized gel within
20 h (Fig. 3B), suggesting that the collagenolytic activity promoted
by combining these two growth factors in the presence of plasminogen surpassed any threshold limitations.
TGF-B1 + EGF-stimulated collagen gel dissolution occurs via
a plasmin/MMP-10/MMP-1–dependent axis. Because plasmindependent collagen degradation has been linked to MMP-13 upregulation in mouse keratinocytes (26), it was necessary to assess
whether MMP-13 might be involved in TGF-h1 + EGF-initiated
collagenolysis. Similar to what has been reported previously
for other HaCaT variants (13, 27), TGF-h1 stimulation significantly increased MMP-13 levels in HaCaT II-4 cells (Fig. 4A).
Only a modest elevation in MMP-13 was evident, however, following coincubation with TGF-h1 + EGF (Fig. 4A). MMP-10, in
contrast, was substantially increased under these conditions
(Fig. 4A and B).
ProMMP-10 is a plasmin substrate (21), and whereas active
MMP-10 does not cleave collagen type 1 directly, it does activate
the collagenase MMP-1 (20). Subsequent to TGF-h1 + EGF
stimulation, MMP-10 activation was evident by 4 h post-plasminogen addition and complete by 24 h (Fig. 5A, top), whereas the
kinetics of MMP-1 activation closely followed the conversion of
MMP-10 to a catalytic form (Fig. 5A, bottom). To confirm the role of
MMP-10 in collagen matrix degradation, plasminogen was added
to TGF-h1 + EGF-stimulated HaCaT II-4 cultures in the presence
of increasing concentrations of neutralizing antibodies to either

www.aacrjournals.org

MMP-1 or MMP-10. MMP-1 inhibition prevented plasminogendependent collagen dissolution (Fig. 5B, top). Importantly, neutralization of MMP-10 activity also blocked plasminogen-initiated
collagen degradation (Fig. 5B, bottom), supporting a plasmin/MMP10/MMP-1–dependent axis in matrix remodeling. A notable decrease in the level of active MMP-1 was also consistently evident
following MMP-10 neutralization (Fig. 5C). Despite residual levels
of active, likely plasmin-generated MMP-1, this activity by itself
was insufficient, however, to trigger gel dissolution on MMP-10
inhibition (Fig. 5B).
PAI-1 functions as an upstream regulator of a MMP-10–
initiated collagenolytic phenotype. Similar to MMP-10, PAI-1
expression in HaCaT II-4 cells is increased in response to TGF-h1
stimulation (12), whereas the combination of TGF-h1 + EGF
synergistically enhanced PAI-1 protein levels (Fig. 6A; Supplementary Fig. S4A). Despite the inability of EGF alone to increase PAI-1
levels in this system, enhanced PAI-1 synthesis resulting from
TGF-h1 + EGF stimulation, as well as from TGF-h1 alone, was
attenuated by inhibition of EGF receptor signaling with AG1478
(Fig. 6A). Similar results were evident in human dermal fibroblasts
(Supplementary Fig. S4B) and kidney epithelial cells (22), emphasizing the generality of EGF receptor involvement in TGF-h1–
dependent PAI-1 production.
PAI-1, through its inhibition of urokinase-type plasminogen
activator, is critical for regulating the generation of pericellular
plasmin. It was important, therefore, to assess the effect of PAI-1 on
collagen gel dissolution. Blocking urokinase-type plasminogen
activator activity with the inhibitor amiloride, or by adding a
stable recombinant form of PAI-1 protein (N150H, K154T, Q319L,
and M345I; ref. 28), completely inhibited collagen gel dissolution
(Fig. 6B). Addition of PAI-1 protein also effectively blocked conversion of MMP-10 and MMP-1 to their active forms (Fig. 6C).
In contrast, neutralization of endogenous PAI-1 with functionblocking antibodies accelerated both collagenolysis (Fig. 6B)
and activation of MMP-10 and MMP-1 (Fig. 6C). Collectively,
these results indicate that, in the physiologically relevant setting
of a complex three-dimensional collagen environment, PAI-1
regulates MMP-10–initiated collagenolytic activity (Fig. 6D). A
key factor in this model is the ability of active MMP-10 to
superactivate MMP-1, creating a plasmin/MMP-10/MMP-1 proteolytic axis that enhances collagen type 1 degradation and facilitates
collagen gel invasion.

Discussion
MMPs are integral components of a complex stromal remodeling program designed to modulate matrix integrity, release
bioactive fragments, growth factors, and cytokines from matrix
constituents, and enhance cell motility (29). Amplified MMP expression appears linked to increased tumor aggressiveness, metastasis, and poor patient survival (30). Not surprisingly, recently,
studies also implicate several MMPs, including MMP-3,
-7, -9, and -28, in directly triggering EMT-related processes (30).
The combination of TGF-h and EGF, which effectively promotes
EMT, also up-regulates certain MMPs synergistically including
MMP-1, -3, -9, -10, and -14 (17, 18), posing some interesting
questions regarding potential mechanisms that support amplification of EMT-associated events.
An acute collagenolytic phenotype linked to plasmin-dependent
activation of stromelysin-2 (MMP-10) emerged in response to
costimulation of HaCaT II-4 keratinocytes with TGF-h1 and EGF

and was coincident with collagen gel invasion. MMP-10, which is
generally limited to epithelial cells (15, 19), has broad substrate
specificity, targeting proMMP-1, -7, -8, -9, and -13 as well as collagen types III, IV, and V, gelatin elastin, fibronectin, proteoglycans,
and laminin (20, 21). Rigorous control over MMP-10 levels and
activation are likely critical, therefore, for normal cutaneous
homeostasis. MMP-10, in fact, is not evident in intact skin but is
expressed during cutaneous injury repair where it localizes to
migrating keratinocytes at the wound edge, suggesting that its
presence may facilitate invasive behavior (31).
Similar to what has been observed in other systems (15, 18,
19, 27), MMP-10 and MMP-1 were up-regulated in HaCaT II-4 cells
seeded onto collagen gels and stimulated with TGF-h1 and/or EGF.
Both proenzymes are plasmin substrates; however, following MMP10 inhibition, the residual level of active, likely plasmin-generated
MMP-1 (Fig. 5C) was insufficient by itself to trigger collagen
gel dissolution (Fig. 5B). These data likely reflect the established
ability of MMP-10 to ‘‘superactivate’’ MMP-1 and enhance its collagenase activity 7- to 10-fold over that observed with plasmin
alone (19). Given these parameters, neutralization of MMP-10
activity would have quenched this hypercollagenase activity and,
as observed, impeded collagen degradation. Similar results regarding MMP-10–dependent superactivation of MMP-1, -8, and -13 in
an arthritis-based model have been reported but not linked to
plasminogen activation (32). Consequently, this article is the first to
show a plasmin/MMP-10/MMP-1–dependent collagen remodeling
axis and establish its relevance in a keratinocyte-based threedimensional model.
Clearly, MMP-10 activity can have significant stromal consequences, particularly in a cutaneous environment, irrespective
of its level of up-regulation. Amplified MMP-10 expression does,

however, accompany the progression of several epithelial cancers,
including squamous cell carcinomas of the head and neck and
esophagus (33, 34). Increased MMP-10 expression also occurs in
colorectal carcinoma (35), breast cancer (36), prostate cancer
(37), and lymphoma (38). It localizes to cells at the invasive front
of renal cell carcinomas and signals a lower survival rate
compared with patients with MMP-10–negative tumors (39).
Similarly, tumor MMP-10 levels predict poor survival in non-small
cell lung cancer (40).
Like MMPs, lysosomal proteinase cathepsins are also associated
with tumor cell invasion, particularly the cysteine proteinases
cathepsins L and B, which degrade collagen type 1 and activate
MMP-1, respectively (41). Inhibition of cysteine cathepsins had no
effect, however, on collagen gel dissolution in the HaCaT II-4
model, whereas serine proteinase blockade effectively attenuated
collagen degradation. These data emphasize a critical role for
active plasmin, and not cathepsins, in the initiation of collagen
degradation by TGF-h1 + EGF-stimulated cells and are consistent
with observations regarding the ability of TGF-h to down-regulate
cathepsins (42).
Previously, intermediates other than MMP-10, including MMP13, have been associated with linking keratinocyte-based collagen
type 1 dissolution and plasminogen activation (26, 43). Studies
suggest, however, that contrary to observations in primary human
keratinocytes, MMP-13 expression is, in fact, correlated with
transformation of human keratinocytes and enhanced in these
cells, including HaCaT derivatives, following stimulation with TGFh1 (13, 27). Our data in a three-dimensional system also indicate
that TGF-h1 stimulation alone increases the level of MMP-13;
however, the combination of TGF-h1 + EGF did not produce this
effect. Costimulated cells instead exhibited a robust induction of

MMP-10. This disparity may be due, in part, to differences among
the ras-HaCaT variants in MMP expression programs (44), TGF-h/
EGF-related receptor cross-talk promoting EGF-dependent downregulation of TGF-h1–enhanced MMP-13 levels (18, 45), or culture
in two-dimensional versus a more complex three-dimensional
stromal-equivalent system. The potential for EGF to counteract a
TGF-h1–dependent increase in MMP-13 production reinforces the
complexity of this process and presents some intriguing questions
for future investigation regarding the regulation of these matrixmodifying enzymes in cancer progression.
Consistent with recent observations regarding receptor crosstalk
and synergy (17, 18), PAI-1 levels increased synergistically following
TGF-h1 + EGF treatment of HaCaT II-4 cells on a collagen
substrate (Fig. 6A). During tumor progression, synergistic amplification of PAI-1 would, in effect, inhibit a disproportionate level of

stromal degradation and, in doing so, facilitate cell migration by
preserving stromal architecture as well as by interacting with the
low-density lipoprotein-related receptor (46). Up-regulation of both
MMP-10 and PAI-1 in conjunction with a TGF-h1 + EGF-stimulated
EMT, therefore, promotes an environment conducive to the acquisition of an invasive phenotype. Indeed, like MMP-10, PAI-1
expression is up-regulated in various cancers where its presence
is associated with poor patient outcome (47, 48). The incidence
of stromal PAI-1 is an important factor in determining tumor
progression, reflecting its capacity to stabilize the microenvironment and promote tumor vascularization (49, 50).
Temporal and spatial balance between extracellular components
that reorganize tissue architecture is a significant aspect of
tumor progression. This study has identified an important
proteolytic axis for regulating collagen type 1 degradation in a

three-dimensional environment. The data provided are consistent
with a model (Fig. 6D) in which transformed keratinocytes, in
response to TGF-h1 + EGF in the microenvironment, up-regulate
proMMP-10, which is converted to its active form in the presence
of plasmin and can subsequently superactivate the catalytic activity
of MMP-1. This process results in a plasmin/MMP-10/MMP-1–
dependent proteolytic axis that effectively enhances collagen type 1
degradation and facilitates collagen gel invasion. PAI-1 plays a
crucial role in this paradigm through its ability to counter excessive
collagen degradation and maintain stromal integrity for cell
migration. Identification of critical components involved in
managing the rate and level of collagen type 1 degradation may
