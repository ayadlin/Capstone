Abstract

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Fulvestrant is a selective estrogen receptor downregulator (SERD) and highly effective antagonist
to hormone-sensitive breast cancers following failure of previous tamoxifen or aromatase inhibitor
therapies. However, after prolonged fulvestrant therapy, acquired resistance eventually occurs in
the majority of breast cancer patients, due to poorly understood mechanisms. To examine a
possible role(s) of aberrantly expressed microRNAs (miRNAs) in acquired fulvestrant resistance,
we compared antiestrogen-resistant and -sensitive breast cancer cells, revealing the overexpression of miR-221/222 in the SERD-resistant cell lines. Fulvestrant treatment of estradiol
(E2)- and fulvestrant-sensitive MCF7 cells resulted in increased expression of endogenous
miR-221/222. Ectopic upregulation of miR-221/222 in estrogen receptor-α (ERα)-positive cell
lines counteracted the effects of E2 depletion or fulvestrant-induced cell death, thus also
conferring hormone-independent growth and fulvestrant resistance. In cells with acquired
resistance to fulvestrant, miR-221/222 expression was essential for cell growth and cell cycle
progression. To identify possible miR-221/222 targets, miR-221- or miR-222- induced alterations
in global gene expression profiles and target gene expression at distinct time points were
determined, revealing that miR-221/222 overexpression resulted in deregulation of multiple
oncogenic signaling pathways previously associated with drug resistance. Activation of β-catenin
by miR-221/222 contributed to estrogen-independent growth and fulvestrant resistance, whereas
TGF-β-mediated growth inhibition was repressed by the two miRNAs. This first in-depth
investigation into the role of miR-221/222 in acquired fulvestrant resistance, a clinically important

Introduction

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Estrogen receptor-α (ERα), the primary mediator of estrogen action, plays a pivotal role in
the development and progression of breast cancer (Ariazi et al., 2006). As over 70% of
breast cancers overexpress ERα, targeting the receptor by endocrine therapy is considered
the most important treatment for patients with ER-positive breast tumors (Ariazi et al.,
2006). Tamoxifen, a selective estrogen receptor modulator (Jordan, 2003), and aromatase
inhibitors (AIs), which block estrogen synthesis (Smith and Dowsett, 2003), are effective
first-line endocrine therapies that significantly improve relapse-free and overall survival of
all stages of ER-positive breast cancer (Nicholson and Johnston, 2005). However, acquired
resistance to both tamoxifen and AI typically develops after prolonged treatment in a
majority of initially responsive breast cancers (Normanno et al., 2005), and nearly 50% of
the advanced ER-positive breast cancer patients do not respond to tamoxifen or AI in the
first-line setting (Normanno et al., 2005).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Resistance to AIs and tamoxifen is associated with activation of several growth factor
signaling pathways, including human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) and
insulin-like growth factor I receptor, which ‘cross-talk’ with the ERα signaling pathway,
resulting in an activation of various mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) and PI3K/
AKT involved in cell survival and proliferation (Ali and Coombes, 2002; Nicholson and
Johnston, 2005; Normanno et al., 2005). As the transcriptional program of ERα continues to
play a critical role in these acquired resistance mechanisms, second-line endocrine therapies,
using alternative ERα-inhibitory mechanisms, have been developed (McDonnell, 2006).
One of these, the pure steroidal antiestrogen fulvestrant (Faslodex, ICI 182,780, AstraZeneca Corp., London, UK), completely suppresses ERα activity, inactivating both ERαmediated genomic and non-genomic signaling, and is now approved for the treatment of
postmenopausal women following failure of previous antiestrogen therapy (tamoxifen and
AIs) (Howell, 2006a). However, despite its potent antitumor effects, fulvestrant does not
circumvent the development of antiestrogen resistance (Howell, 2006b). We (Fan et al.,
2006) and others (Nicholson et al., 2005; Normanno et al., 2005) have shown that acquired
resistance to fulves-trant is an ERα-independent phenomenon, involving constitutive
activation of autocrine-regulated growth-stimulatory pathways, ultimately dissociating
breast cancer cells from ERα-mediated growth, although the mechanism(s) of upregulation
of these mitogenic pathways remains unknown.
MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are an abundant class of endogenous small non-coding RNAs (20–
22 nucleotides in length) that regulate crucial biological processes, including development,
differentiation, apoptosis and proliferation (Bushati and Cohen, 2007). Imperfect pairing of
miRNAs with the 3′ untranslated region of target mRNAs generally results in their
destabilization or ribosomal blockade (Bushati and Cohen, 2007). Deregulation of miRNAs
is now considered a hallmark of cancer (Calin and Croce, 2006), in which they can function
as oncogenes or tumor suppressors (Garzon et al., 2009). In breast cancer, miR-125b, -145,
-21 and -155 have been shown the most significantly deregulated miRNAs (Iorio et al.,
2005) and miR-7, -128a, -210, and -516-3p have been strongly associated with cancer
progression (Foekens et al., 2008). Furthermore, miR-10b may play a role in breast cancer

invasion and metastasis (Ma et al., 2007), and miR-206 is inversely correlated with ERα
expression in human breast tumors and appears to target ERα (Adams et al., 2007; Kondo et
al., 2008). Estradiol (E2)-regulated miRNA signatures, and miRNA regulation of ERα and
its downstream transcriptional response to E2 have also recently been reported (BhatNakshatri et al., 2009; Castellano et al., 2009), and an important role for miRNAs in ERα
biology is beginning to emerge (Klinge, 2009).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Although altered expression of miRNAs in breast cancer has been widely reported (Iorio et
al., 2005, 2008; Heneghan et al., 2009), the functional consequences of aberrant expression
of specific miRNAs in antiestrogen-resistant disease remain unclear. Overexpression of
miR-221 and miR-222 has been observed in a number of advanced malignancies (Galardi et
al., 2007; Gillies and Lorimer, 2007; Visone et al., 2007; Felicetti et al., 2008; Fornari et al.,
2008; Garofalo et al., 2009; Pineau et al., 2010), including ERα-negative primary tumors
(Zhao et al., 2008), and has also been associated with tamoxifen resistance (Miller et al.,
2008). Our previous miRNA microarray data also indicated miR-221/222 upregulation in
acquired fulvestrant resistance (Xin et al., 2009). In the current study, we used antiestrogensensitive and -resistant breast cancer cell line models to comprehensively investigate the role
of miR-221/222 in hormone-independent growth and acquired resistance to fulvestrant.
miR-221/222-transfected cells demonstrated that global gene expression changes associated
with multiple (ER-independent) growth-promoting, oncogenic pathways are critical for
acquired selective estrogen receptor downregulator (SERD) resistance. We further validated
that miR-221/222 activated β-catenin signaling and repressed TGF-β-signaling-induced
growth inhibition. These results indicate vital, multi-functional roles of miR-221/222 in the
acquisition of fulvestrant-resistant breast cancer.

Results
miR-221/222 expression is increased in antiestrogen-resistant breast cancer cell lines and
is upregulated by fulvestrant in antiestrogen-sensitive MCF7 cells

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

To investigate the association between miR-221/222 expression and antiestrogen resistance,
four different antiestrogen-resistant human breast cancer cell lines were compared, each
derived by different mechanisms. Tamoxifen-resistant (MCF7-T) and fulvestrant-resistant
(MCF7-F) MCF7 sublines were established by prolonged growth of MCF7 cells in
tamoxifen- or fulvestrant-containing media, respectively (Fan et al., 2006). MCF7-T cells
remained responsive to fulvestrant but with reduced drug sensitivity compared with the
parental MCF7 cells, whereas MCF7-F cells were fulvestrant-resistant and also crossresistant to tamoxifen. The expression profile analysis indicated that subsets of clinically
relevant genes (prognostic markers, clinical outcome and ERα signature genes) are altered
in these two cell lines (Fan et al., 2006), making them valuable models for investigating the
molecular events underlying the development of antiestrogen resistance. Tumor necrosis
factor-resistant (MCF7-TNR) cells were obtained by prolonged exposure of MCF7 cells to
increasing concentrations of tumor necrosis factor-α (Weldon et al., 2004), whereas MCF7Mek5 cells were established by stably transfecting MCF7 cells with constitutively active
mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 5 (MEK5) construct (Zhou et al., 2008). Both the
MCF7-TNR and -Mek5 cell lines were resistant to tumor necrosis factor-α-(Zhou et al.,
2008) and fulvestrant-induced apoptosis (unpublished data). Real-time qRT–PCR results
revealed upregulation of miR-221/222 in MCF7-T cells (Figure 1a), consistent with a
previous study (Miller et al., 2008). However, in the fulvestrant-resistant cells (MCF7-F,
MCF7-Mek5 and MCF7-TNR), miR-221/222 were markedly overexpressed (P<0.01, versus
MCF7-T) (Figure 1a), suggesting a stronger association of miR-221/222 with pure antiestrogen resistance.

Considering the different mechanisms of tamoxifen and fulvestrant action, we next
examined the effects of these two drugs on endogenous miR-221/222 expression. To avoid
the effects of medium-derived estrogen, MCF7 cells were cultured in estrogen-free medium
for 3 days and then treated with different drug combinations. Although expression of
miR-221/222 was not significantly altered by 17β-estradiol (E2), 4-hydroxytamoxifen
(OHT) or E2 combined with OHT during the first 24 h, these drug treatments actually
repressed (P<0.01) miR-221/222 expression at subsequent time points (48–96 h; Figure 1b).
By contrast, fulvestrant, alone or in combination with E2, increased (P<0.01) endogenous
miR-221/222 expression after 48-h treatment (Figure 1b). As miR-221/222 were
overexpressed in fulvestrant-resistant cell lines (Figure 1a), these results suggest that
fulvestrant treatment (or removal of ERα) might initially induce miR-221/222 expression
during the development of SERD resistance.
miR-221/222 confer estrogen-independent growth and fulvestrant resistance

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

As miR-221/222 expression was induced by fulvestrant and associated with fulvestrant
resistance, we next investigated the role of miR-221/222 in the acquisition of fulvestrant
resistance. Fulvestrant-sensitive MCF7, MCF7-T and BT474 breast cancer cells were
transfected with pre-miRNA to ectopically overexpress miR-221/222, as confirmed by qRT–
PCR and immunoblotting analysis for suppressed p27Kip1 and ERα protein levels, two wellknown targets of these miRNAs (Galardi et al., 2007; Zhao et al., 2008) (Figure 2a).
Although the growth of MCF7 cells was retarded in estrogen-free medium, the proliferation
of miR-221 and/or miR-222-overexpressing MCF7 cells was significantly (P<0.01)
accelerated (Figure 2b), which was further confirmed using MCF7-T and BT474 cell lines
(Figure 2b). After E2 depletion for four days, the scramble control siRNA-treated MCF7
cells exhibited previously described morphological signs of cellular damage (Gozuacik and
Kimchi, 2004; Miller et al., 2008), which were not observed in miR-221 and/or miR-222overexpressing MCF7 cells (Figure 2c, upper panel, arrows indicated). Immunofluorescence
staining with anti-LC3B (a marker of autophagy) antibody revealed punctated patterns of
LC3 immunofluorescence in scramble control-treated MCF7 cells, whereas LC3
immunofluorescence in miR-221 and/or miR-222-overexpressing cells was diffused (Figure
2c, lower panel). In addition, MCF7 cells overexpressing miR-221 and/or miR-222
displayed a rounded phenotype and were loosely attached to the culture surface (Figure 2c),
morphologic characteristics of the aggressive MCF7-F cells (Fan et al., 2006).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

To further examine miR-221/222 effects on fulvestrant sensitivity, hormone-sensitive MCF7
cells were treated with different doses of fulvestrant for 7 days, showing strong growth
inhibition in the control-transfected cells (Figure 2d, left panel); however, that growth
inhibition was markedly blunted in the miR-221 and/or miR-222-overexpressing cells
(Figure 2d, Supplementary Figure S1). Ectopically overexpressing miR-221/222 in MCF7-T
cells (which have a slightly higher miR-221/222 expression than MCF7 (Figure 1a) but are
still sensitive to fulvestrant) also significantly decreased fulvestrant sensitivity (Figure 2d
middle panel). Similar results were observed in BT474 cells, which have low miR-221/222
expression (data not shown) but are less fulvestrant sensitive than MCF7 cells (Figure 2d
right panel). Immunoblotting analysis (Figure 2a and Supplementary Figure S2) further
suggested that targeting p27Kip1 may be one of the mechanisms by which miR-221/222
confers the ERα-independent, fulvestrant-resistant phenotype. Taken together, these results
indicate that miR-221/222 over-expression in ERα-positive cell lines counteracts the effects
of E2 depletion or fulvestrant-induced cell death, thus also conferring hormone-independent
growth and fulvestrant resistance.

Knockdown of miR-221/222 in MCF7-F cells inhibits cell proliferation

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

To further investigate the role of miR-221/222 in fulvestrant resistance, MCF7-F cells were
transfected with 2′-O-Me-221 (si-221) and 2′-O-Me-222 (si-222), or control 2′-O-MeeGFP (NEG) antagomirs. After 24 h, miR-221 and miR-222 expression was dramatically
reduced in the si-221/222-transfected MCF7-F cells, and p27Kip1 protein levels were
restored (Figure 3a; Supplementary Figure S3). BrdU cell proliferation assays indicated that
si-221 or si-222 significantly decreased MCF7-F cell growth by decreasing the cell
population in S-phase, with si-222 demonstrating stronger inhibitory activity (Figure 3b),
perhaps due to cross-inhibition of miR-221 by si-222 (Supplementary Figure S4).
Cotransfection of si-221 and si-222 resulted in further inhibition of cell proliferation (Figure
3b). As clonogenic activity of MCF7-F cells was greater than the parental MCF7 cells
(Supplementary Figure S5), we then examined the role of miR-221/222 in the increased
clonogenicity. MCF7-F cells were cotransfected with antagomirs and a Block-iT
Fluorescence Oligo (Invitrogen Corp., Carlsbad, CA, USA) for sorting transfected cells for
subsequent clonogenicity assays. As shown in Figure 3c, si-221/222 significantly decreased
the clonogenic activity of MCF7-F cells. Collectively, these studies demonstrate that
miR-221/222 play a key role in supporting the proliferation of fulvestrant-resistant cells.
miR-221/222 regulate global gene expression and multiple signaling pathways involved in
acquired fulvestrant resistance

NIH-PA Author Manuscript
NIH-PA Author Manuscript

The underlying mechanism of miR-221/222-mediated fulvestrant resistance appears to
include downregulation of the cell cycle inhibitors p27Kip1 and p57Kip2 (Galardi et al., 2007;
Fornari et al., 2008), in addition to ERα (Zhao et al., 2008; Di Leva et al., 2010). However,
recent bioinformatic analyses (John et al., 2004) predict that a single miRNA is capable of
regulating hundreds of genes, resulting in extensive miRNA-induced mRNA degradation
(Filipowicz et al., 2008), and global gene expression changes (Huang et al., 2007; Nam et
al., 2009). To gain further insight into the functional role of miR-221/222 in acquired
fulvestrant resistance, we performed mRNA expression profiling after knocking down
miR-221 or miR-222 in MCF7-F cells. As the mRNA and protein levels of p27Kip1 (used as
a control) did not strongly correlate (Supplementary Figure S6), we used a moderate
stringency to identify significantly regulated genes (P-value <0.05 and a fold-change >1.2 or
<−1.2). Two-dimensional unsupervised hierarchical clustering (average linkage clustering
method) was utilized to visualize common expression patterns between samples. Clustering
results of all significantly up- or downregulated probes demonstrated a si-221 and si-222
cluster, and a separate control cluster (Figure 4a). After downregulation of miR-221 or
miR-222, respectively, we identified 1347 or 1029 upregulated, and 912 or 909
downregulated probes, with 428 probes upregulated and 224 probes downregulated by both
(Supplementary Figure S7). For in-depth analysis, we also included our previous gene
expression profiles of pre-miRNA-treated MCF7 cells (Di Leva et al., 2010), and the
clustering results indicated a similar pattern (Figure 4b).
To investigate the functional role of miR-221/222-regulated genes, pathway-express
analysis (Draghici et al., 2007) was used, and genes regulated by si-221 or si-222 in MCF7F cells were significantly enriched in 23 or 17 KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and
Genomes) (Kanehisa and Goto, 2000) pathways (Supplementary Table S1), represented by
p53, TGF-β, MAPK, Notch, ErbB, and Jak-STAT signaling pathway (Figure 4a). Genes
regulated by pre-221 or pre-222 in MCF7 cells were enriched in 21 or 22 KEGG pathways,
represented by phosphatidylinositol signaling system, MAPK, TGF-β, ErbB, p53, apoptosis
and Wnt signaling pathways (Figure 4b). Representative genes in these pathways are listed
in Table 1. Our previous study demonstrated that both EGFR/ErbB2 and Wnt/β-catenin
pathways play a role in supporting estrogen-independent cell growth of MCF7-F (Fan et al.,
2006) and the Cignal Finder Cancer Pathway Reporter Assay (SABiosciences, Frederick,

MD, USA) also showed upregulation of Wnt signaling in MCF7-F cells compared with
MCF7, as well as Notch, p53, MAPK, whereas downregulation of TGF-β signaling
(Supplementary Figure S8). These pathways are regulated by miR-221/222 (described
above), further supporting the multifunctional role of miR-221/222 in the acquisition of
fulvestrant resistance.
Time-course gene expression after ectopic expression of miR-221/222

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

As overexpressing miR-221/222 conferred estrogen-independent growth and fulvestrant
resistance to MCF7 cells, we examined time-course changes in gene expression associated
with this phenomenon. Based on the above gene expression profiles, 10 genes upregulated
by miR-221/222 in MCF7 cells (Supplementary Table S2) were chosen for further study
performing qRT–PCR at 4, 12, 24, 48, 72 and 120 h after transfection of MCF7 cells with
pre-miR-221/222. p27Kip1, a known target of miR-221/222, decreased by 12 h after
transfection (Figure 5a). Two key components of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway, FZD5 and
CTNNB1 (β-catenin), were upregulated by 12 h (Figure 5a). Increased expression of TGF-β
pathway components, BMPR2 and SMAD2, was observed by 24 h after transfection,
whereas TGFBR2 was increased by 48 h (Figures 5b and c). The cytokines CCL5 and
GDF15, and cytokine receptors CRCR4 were upregulated by 24 and 48 h, respectively
(Figures 5b and c). Expression of the STAT1 transcription factor increased by 48 h.
Increased expression of GADD45A, which is involved in p53, MAPK, and cell-cycle
pathways was seen by 48 h (Figure 5c). Of the genes downregulated by miR-221/222, only
one was decreased by 12 h after transfection (Supplementary Figure S9), suggesting that
miR-221/222 downregulation of their targets occurs mainly at the protein level in MCF7
cells.
Regulation of β-catenin expression and transcriptional activity by miR-221/222

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

β-Catenin is a key regulator in the Wnt signal transduction cascade (Takahashi-Yanaga and
Kahn, 2010), and we previously demonstrated a vital role of β-catenin for acquired
fulvestrant resistance as upregulation and activation of β-catenin contributed to estrogenindependent growth of MCF7-F (Fan et al., 2006). As β-catenin mRNA levels rapidly (12 h)
increased in MCF7 cells when overexpressing miR-221/222 (Figure 5a) and knockdown of
miR-221 and/or miR-222 decreased β-catenin protein levels in MCF7-F cells
(Supplementary Figure S10), we hypothesized that miR-221/222 serves as a positive
regulator of β-catenin expression and transcriptional activity. To test this hypothesis, we
first confirmed the upregulation of β-catenin mRNA levels by miR-221/222 in MCF7-T and
BT474 cells (Figure 6a), which also increased fulvestrant resistance as previously indicated
(Figure 2d). As only nuclear β-catenin has been shown to be transcriptionally active
(Shitashige et al., 2008), we examined nuclear β-catenin protein levels. After overexpressing
miR-221 and/or miR-222, elevated nuclear β-catenin levels were observed in all three cell
lines (MCF7, MCF7-T and BT474; Figure 5b), whereas β-catenin levels in the cytoplasm
were also increased in MCF7 and MCF7-T cells. Wnt signaling reporter analysis using
TOPflash and FOPflash plasmids (Korinek et al., 1997) confirmed that overexpression of
miR-221/222 in MCF7 cells upregulated β-catenin-mediated gene transcription (Figure 6c).
To further investigate whether the increased β-catenin activity contributed to miR-221/222mediated estrogen-independent growth, epigallocatechin-3-gallate was used to inhibit βcatenin activity (Kim et al., 2006). Cell proliferation assays revealed that inhibiting βcatenin activity blocked the growth of miR-221 and/or miR-222-overexpressing MCF7 cells,
but not parental MCF7 cells or scramble control-treated cells (Figure 6d). Taken together,
these results implicate miR-221/222 as a positive regulator of β-catenin expression and
transcriptional activity, and the subsequent transactivation of β-catenin target genes appears
to contribute to the acquisition of estrogen-independent growth.

β-Catenin overexpression partially confers fulvestrant resistance

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Having demonstrated that miR221/222-activated β-catenin supports estrogen-independent
growth, we next examined whether β-catenin alone is enough to confer fulvestrant
resistance. MCF7 cells were transiently transfected with β-catenin-overexpressing plasmids
and then treated with varying doses of fulvestrant. Cell proliferation assays indicated that
although β-catenin alone was not able to increase cell growth in estrogen-free medium
(Supplementary Figure S11), cells over-expressing β-catenin were more vulnerable to
fulvestrant-induced growth inhibition compared with empty vector-treated cells or parental
cells (Figure 7a). Immuno-blotting analysis indicated that overexpression of β-catenin
occurred mostly in the cytoplasmic fraction (Figure 7b), suggesting the existence of other
factors in MCF7 that repress β-catenin nuclear translocation. These results demonstrated
that although β-catenin contributes to acquired fulvestrant resistance, β-catenin
overexpression alone was not sufficient for estrogen-independent growth, further suggesting
a requirement for additional miR-221/222-regulated genes.
miR-221/222 modulate the effects of TGF-β

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

An association between TGF-β signaling pathway and antiestrogen resistance has been
reported (Buck and Knabbe, 2006). Based on our expression profiling results showing that
miR-221/222-regulated genes in MCF7 and MCF7-F cells were enriched for the TGF-β
pathway (Figure 4) and cell proliferation assays revealing a growth inhibitory effect of TGFβ1 on MCF7 but not MCF7-F cells (Supplementary Figure S12) (Kalkhoven et al., 1995;
Sovak et al., 1999), we hypothesized that the altered sensitivity to TGF-β-induced growth
inhibition was associated with miR-221/222 expression. To examine this possibility, premiRNA-treated MCF7 cells were treated with TGF-β1. Overexpression of miR-221 and/or
miR-222 increased MCF7 cell survival (versus scramble control; Figure 8a), and
knockdown of miR-221 and/or miR-222 in MCF7-F cells resulted in growth inhibition by
TGF-β1 (Figure 8b). As TGF-β can act as a tumor suppressor or enhancer in breast cancer
(Zugmaier et al., 1989; McEarchern et al., 2001), miR-221/222 may serve as an important
mediator of the transition of TGF-β from growth suppressor to tumor promoter.

Discussion

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Acquired fulvestrant resistance is associated with loss of ERα expression, E2-independent
growth, and activation of multiple growth-stimulatory pathways (Nicholson et al., 2005;
Normanno et al., 2005; Fan et al., 2006). Recent studies (Miller et al., 2008; Zhao et al.,
2008), including our own (Xin et al., 2009), suggest a prominent role of miR-221 and -222
in the acquisition of antiestrogen resistance. In the current study, we demonstrate that
marginal miR-221/222 upregulation (~2-fold) is associated with tamoxifen resistance but
marked overexpression (up to 25-fold) of miR-221/222 is characteristic of fulvestrant
resistance (Figure 1a). Ectopic expression of miR-221/222 counteracts the well-known
effects of E2 starvation and fulvestrant-induced cell damage and death in fulvestrantsensitive cells, whereas strikingly increasing cellular proliferation and conferring SERD
resistance (Figure 2). However, downregulation of miR-221/222 significantly suppresses
cell growth and clonogenic activity of fulvestrant-resistant cells (Figure 3). Interestingly,
both E2 and tamoxifen repress expression of endogenous miR-221/222 in MCF7 cells, but
fulvestrant dramatically induces miR-221/222 (Figure 1b), suggesting that constitutive
upregulation of miR-221/222 seen in fulvestrant-resistant cells is likely initiated by
prolonged SERD treatment, attenuating the ERα/E2-mediated repression of miR-221/222, in
accord with our recent study on a negative miR-221/222-ERα regulatory loop (Di Leva et
al., 2010). As it is well established that maintenance of a strong ERα-positive phenotype is
characteristic of tamoxifen-resistant breast cancer cells (Wijayaratne et al., 1999; Fan et al.,
2006), upregulation of miR-221/222 in tamoxifen-resistant cells (Figure 1a; Miller et al.,

2008) must be due to a different mechanism(s). Interestingly, upregulation of these two
miRNAs has recently been reported in CD44+CD24−/lowlineage− human breast cancer stem
cells (Shimono et al., 2009), which are believed to be largely responsible for propagating the
drug-resistant phenotype (O’Brien et al., 2009), further stressing the importance of
miR-221/222 in breast cancer progression and acquisition of antiestrogen resistance.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

By analyzing miR-221/222-regulated gene expression profiles (knockdown of miR-221/222
in FR and over-expression of miR-221/222 in MCF7), we demonstrate that multiple
oncogenic signaling pathways are regulated by miR-221/222 (Figure 4), which we (Fan et
al., 2006) and others (Nicholson et al., 2005; Normanno et al., 2005) have reported
contribute to the acquisition of fulvestrant resistance. One of the most strikingly regulated is
the Wnt pathway, showing upregulation of CTNNB1 (β-catenin) and FZD5 12 h after
miR-221/222 overexpression (Figures 5a and 6a). As miRNAs can also upregulate target
gene expression (Vasudevan et al., 2007; Chen et al., 2010), these may represent direct
miR-221/222 targets. However, using two target prediction programs (TargetScan (Lewis et
al., 2003) and PITA (Kertesz et al., 2007)), we were not able to identify seed sequence
binding sites for miR-221/222 in β-catenin and FZD. In addition, mRNA stability assays
using 5,6-dichloro-1–D-ribofuranosylbenzimidazole demonstrated that β-catenin
upregulation occurs at the transcriptional level (data not shown). Thus, the mechanism of
miR-221/222-induced activation of β-catenin transcription remains unclear. Interestingly,
miR-221/222 also dramatically increases β-catenin protein levels, particularly in the nuclear
fraction (Figure 6b), which is not achievable by introducing β-catenin-overexpressing
plasmids alone (Figure 7b).

β-Catenin is known to be sequestered in the cytoplasm by the destruction complex APC,
AXIN, GSK-3β and CK1α, resulting in proteasomal degradation. Engagement of Wnt
receptors inhibits destruction complex formation, allows for β-catenin release, translocation
to the nucleus and subsequent activation of β-catenin target gene transcription (TakahashiYanaga and Kahn, 2010). In addition to upregulating β-catenin transcription, miR-221/222,
by increasing Wnt5A and FZD5 expression (Table 1), may activate Wnt signaling and/or
facilitate β-catenin nuclear accumulation by repressing Wnt pathway inhibitors AXIN2,
SFRP2, CHD8 and NLK, the predicted targets of miR-221/222 (determined using DIANA
microT 4.0 (Maragkakis et al., 2009)). The observation that miR-221/222-activated βcatenin supports estrogen-independent growth (Figures 6c and d), whereas overexpressing
β-catenin alone does not (or even decreases cell proliferation under estrogen-free conditions;
Supplementary Figure S11), further indicates that miR-221/222 trigger multiple events,
which are required for the development of SERD resistance: β-catenin contributes to
decreased fulvestrant sensitivity, whereas other factors further promote autocrine-regulated
proliferation.
The most commonly regulated pathway by miR-221/222 in MCF7 and MCF7-F cells is the
TGF-β signaling pathway (Figure 4), with increased TGFBR2, BMPR2 and SMAD2 after
transfection (24–48 h; Figures 5b and c). SMADs (SMAD1/2/3), key regulators of TGF-β
signaling activity, are upregulated by miR-221/222; however, miR-221/222 also induced
two TGF-β-repressed genes, ID1 and ID3 (Table 1), in accord with downregulated TGF-β
signaling activity in MCF7-F cells (with high miR-221/222 expression, Supplementary
Figure S8 and Figure 1a). Owing to the great diversity of cell-specific gene responses
elicited by TGF-β family members (Massague, 2000), whether the TGF-β pathway is
activated or depressed by miR-221/222 is not clear, but the growth inhibitory effect of TGFβ is suppressed by miR-221/222 (Figure 8). As a potent inhibitor of primary human
mammary epithelial cells and most breast cancer cell lines (Zugmaier et al., 1989; Basolo et
al., 1994), TGF-β is activated by antiestrogens and participates in antiestrogen-induced
growth inhibition (Buck et al., 2004). However, by stimulating angiogenesis, inducing

extracellular matrix degradation, increasing invasion and metastasis, and inhibiting
antitumor immune responses, TGF-β can promote tumor progression during latter stages
(Gorsch et al., 1992; McEarchern et al., 2001). Also, defects in autocrine growth-inhibitory
loops involving TGF-β signal transduction have been recognized as playing a central role in
the development of antiestrogen resistance (Buck and Knabbe, 2006). Thus, miR-221/222
may serve as a switch to turn off the tumor-suppressing effects of TGF-β and enhance its
tumor-promoting function during the acquisition of fulvestrant resistance.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

p53 signaling is also among the pathways that are activated by miR-221/222 (Figure 4), with
upregulation of several p53 target genes, including p21Cip1, PERP, CASP3, FAS, IGFBP3,
GADD45A and SESNs (SESTRINs) (Table 1). MCF7-F cells having elevated miR-221/222
also show higher p53 signaling activity compared with MCF7 (Supplementary Figure S8,
Figure 1a). Oncogene activation induced by miR-221/222 (Table 1) and altered cell
morphology (reduced cell–cell contact, Figure 2c) might drive the activation of p53
(Vousden and Prives, 2009). Although the first identified tumor suppressor, additional roles
for p53 have recently been reported, including regulation of metabolism, acting as
antioxidants and even the antiapoptotic potential to increase cell survival (Janicke et al.,
2008; Vousden and Prives, 2009). miR-221/222 may utilize these newly ascribed-p53
functions to confer fulvestrant resistance. For example, p21Cip1 may also function to inhibit
apoptosis, and GADD45A and SESTRINs allow cells to survive until cellular damage has
been resolved (Vousden and Prives, 2009). Interestingly, PTEN, a recently identified
miR-221/222 target (Garofalo et al., 2009), was not regulated by miR-221/222 in MCF7
cells but slightly induced by miR-221/222 knockdown in MCF7-F cells (Supplementary
Figure S13), implying cell-specific regulation by miR-221/222.
In the focal adhesion pathway, two major components of the caveolae plasma membranes,
CAV1 and CAV2 (Table1 and Supplementary Figure S9), were downregulated by
miR-221/222, consistent with our previous report (Di Leva et al., 2010). Although a
predicted target of miR-221/222 (TargetScan (Lewis et al., 2003)), downregulation of CAV2
was not observed until 72 h, but miR-221/222 overexpression rapidly (12 h) downregulated
CAV1, despite the fact that CAV1 lacks a perfect seed sequence miR-221/222 binding site.
The mechanism(s) underlying this phenomenon requires further investigation. As expression
of both CAV1 and CAV2 has been shown to inversely correlate with HER2/neu expression
and tumor size in human breast cancer (Sagara et al., 2004), CAV1 and CAV2
downregulation may increase cell proliferation and enhance epidermal growth factor
receptor (EGFR) signaling activity.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

miR-221/222 have been considered to be oncogenes or tumor suppressors, depending on
tumor type (Croce, 2009). Based on our results, ERα status may serve as a marker for the
role of miR-221/222 in breast cancer. In ERα-positive cells, which depend on E2/ERα
signaling for proliferation, fulvestrant treatment (Figure 1b) or E2 starvation (Di Leva et al.,
2010) initially induce miR-221/222, which function as tumor suppressors by downregulating
the receptor (Figure 2a). However, prolonged inhibition of ERα activity by fulvestrant
treatment or E2 starvation releases miR-221/222 from the negative regulatory loop, resulting
in constitutive upregulation of miR-221/222. In this scenario, miR-221/222 act as
‘oncomirs’ by targeting cell cycle inhibitors (p27Kip1, p57Kip2), other tumor suppressors
(Garofalo et al., 2009), activating oncogenic signaling pathways (including Wnt, Notch and
MAPK), and modulating TGF-β and p53 signaling to support ERα-independent
proliferation and promote tumor progression. Targeting these two oncomirs may be a
potential therapeutic strategy for preventing the development of fulvestrant resistance or
resensitizing breast tumors to this potent and effective estrogen antagonist.
