BACKGROUND: Octreotide long-acting repeatable (LAR) is indicated for the treatment of carcinoid syndrome and diarrhea related
to VIPoma, and may delay tumor growth in patients with neuroendocrine tumors (NETs). To the authors’ knowledge, the pattern of
octreotide LAR use in clinical practice and its impact on survival outcomes has not been well documented. METHODS: Using the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER)-Medicare database, the authors identified patients with NET aged  65 years who
were diagnosed between July 1999 and December 2007. Patients with US Food and Drug Administration-approved indications for
octreotide LAR were identified from Medicare claims. Multivariate logistic regression was performed to ascertain factors associated
with octreotide LAR use, whereas the Cox proportional hazards model was used to evaluate the impact of octreotide LAR on survival.
RESULTS: Among those with Food and Drug Administration-approved indications, 245 of 4848 patients with distant-stage disease
(51%) and 81 of 807 patients with local/regional disease (10%) initiated treatment with octreotide LAR within 6 months of diagnosis.
Multivariate logistic regression indicated that among those with distant-stage disease, older age ( 80 years vs 65-69 years) (odds
ratio [OR], 0.43; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 0.23-0.81), female sex (OR, 0.62; 95% CI, 0.40-0.97), and living in the South (vs
Northeast) (OR, 0.36; 95% CI, 0.18-0.72) were associated with a lower likelihood of using octreotide LAR. The multivariate proportional hazards model showed that octreotide LAR provided a significant 5-year survival benefit for patients with distant-stage disease
(hazards ratio, 0.61; P .001), whereas this survival benefit was not shown for the patients with local/regional stage (hazards ratio,
0.88; P 5.563). CONCLUSIONS: The results of this retrospective study suggest a possible survival benefit for the use of octreotide
LAR in elderly patients with distant-stage NET with carcinoid syndrome. The results of the current study also suggest that octreotide

INTRODUCTION
Neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) develop from neuroendocrine cells throughout the body and are grouped according to
their embryonic origin: the foregut (lungs, thymus, stomach, and duodenum), the midgut (jejunum, ileum, appendix,
and proximal large bowel), and the hindgut (distal colon and rectum). Midgut NETs are more likely to secrete serotonin
and bioactive substances that lead to the classic carcinoid syndrome with flush and diarrhea. However, patients with
NETs from any site can present with secretory symptoms.
NETs have often been believed to be a group of rare diseases with few effective therapeutic options. However,
recent advances in epidemiology, molecular biology, diagnostics, and therapeutics are reshaping our understanding of the
field.1-4 With improved recognition and diagnostics, the incidence of NETs in the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End
Results (SEER) registries have increased more than 5-fold from 1973 (1.09 per 100,000) to 2004 (5.25 per 100,000).5
Recent completion of randomized controlled studies have led to the approval of a mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitor,

everolimus,3 and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor inhibitor, sunitinib,4 for the treatment of patients with
advanced pancreatic NETs. Treatment options from NETs
arising from other sites are more limited.
Binding to somatostatin receptors 2 and 5, octreotide was initially approved as a subcutaneous injectable
medication on October 21, 1988. Octreotide longacting repeatable (LAR), administered by monthly intramuscular injection, was approved a decade later on November 25, 1998 and is indicated for the treatment of
carcinoid syndrome and secretory syndromes associated
with pancreatic NETs such as diarrhea related to
VIPoma.6 A recent study, PROMID, also found that
octreotide LAR significantly prolonged the time to tumor progression among patients with midgut carcinoid
tumors.7 Current guidelines from the National Comprehensive Cancer Network,8 European Society for Medical
Oncology,9 European Neuroendocrine Tumor Society,10 and North American Neuroendocrine Tumor Society11 are also unanimous in their recommendation of
octreotide LAR for the management of carcinoid syndrome. However, to our knowledge, the literature provides limited information regarding the patterns of use
and clinical effectiveness of octreotide LAR outside of
clinical trial settings. To the best of our knowledge, the
relationship between octreotide LAR use and survival
among patients with NETs has not been explored in
population-based studies.
The objectives of the current study were to use the
SEER-Medicare data to study the patterns of use of
octreotide LAR and to examine the relationship between
its use and survival among elderly patients with NETs
with carcinoid syndrome.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Data Source

The data source for the current study was the National
Cancer Institute’s SEER data linked with Medicare claims
data. The SEER registry is an epidemiological surveillance
system of population-based tumor registries covering
approximately 28% of the US population.12 The SEERMedicare data are considered demographically representative in the literature.13 The data provide information
regarding patients’ demographic, socioeconomic, and
disease-related characteristics, such as age, sex, race,
region, urban/rural status, neighborhood socioeconomic
status, cancer site, stage, histology, date of diagnosis, treatments received, and date of death. The SEER-Medicare
database has been the primary data source of health services research in oncology since its inception.

Ascertainment of Study Cohort and
Identification of Octreotide LAR

We first selected patients with NETs who were diagnosed between July 1, 1999 and December 31,
2007. NETs were identified using International
Classification of Diseases for Oncology, 3rd Edition
(ICD-O-3) codes 8150, 8151, 8152, 8153, 8154,
8155, 8156, 8157, 8240, 8241, 8242, 8243, 8244,
8245, 8246, and 8249. We excluded patients with
poorly differentiated histology, as well as those
aged < 65 years at the time of diagnosis. Next, we
limited the study cohort to those with flushing, diarrhea, or carcinoid syndrome (functional NETs),
the approved condition for use of octreotide LAR.
This was done by requiring patients with NETs to
have at least 2 claims indicative of a hormonal syndrome within 12 months of their cancer diagnosis,
with one occurring within 6 months of diagnosis.
Carcinoid syndromes were identified using any of
the following International Classification of Diseases
9th Revision (ICD-9) codes: carcinoid syndrome
(259.2), flushing (782.62), and diarrhea (564.5 and
787.91).
Using the first claim date of hormonal syndromes as
the index date, we followed patients until December 31,
2009 (the last claims date in the SEER-Medicare data
available at the time of the current study) or death, whichever occurred first. We further restricted the sample to
patients with continuous Medicare Parts A and B enrollment and who were not enrolled in any health maintenance organization within the entire 12 months after the
index date or until death; such restrictions were placed to
ensure that we had complete medical claims with which to
identify octreotide use. We further restricted the sample
to patients who either never received treatment with
octreotide LAR or who received it within 6 months of the
index date, so that the comparison of survival between
patients who received octreotide LAR and those who did
not would not be subject to crossover. Lastly, we excluded
patients with unknown stage of disease and those who
were missing values for covariates. A flowchart detailing
the inclusion and exclusion criteria of the current study
cohort is provided in Table 1.
We identified the use of octreotide LAR from Medicare Carrier and Outpatient claims files using the Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System codes J-2353
and J-2352. Patients were classified as users of octreotide
LAR if the above Healthcare Common Procedure Coding
System codes were found in their Medicare claims within
6 months of the index date.

Explanatory Variables

We included tumor characteristics, other treatments
received, patient demographics, and comorbidity as well
as neighborhood socioeconomic status as explanatory variables in our multivariate analyses. Tumor characteristics
included primary cancer site, histology grade, and year of
diagnosis. We categorized the primary cancer site into 6
groups: small intestine; cecum and appendix; colon; pancreas; larynx, bronchus, lung, trachea, and other respiratory organs; and all others. Histology grade was classified
into 3 categories: well differentiated, moderately differentiated, and not determined/unknown/mixed histology.
Other treatments were characterized by 3 dichotomous
variables indicating whether a patient received surgery,
radiotherapy, and chemotherapy, respectively, within 6
months of a cancer diagnosis.
The choice of the 6-month window was primarily
driven by 2 reasons. First, we were not able to ascertain
whether a carcinoid syndrome diagnosed at a later date
was due to metastasis because the SEER registry only
reports the tumor characteristics of the initial diagnosis
and does not collect information concerning disease recurrence or progression. Second, and more importantly,
not imposing a reasonable duration to observe the
“exposure” (ie, carcinoid syndrome) could lead to biases.
For example, without imposing a time window, a patient
living a longer duration, perhaps with mild carcinoid syndrome, will have more opportunity to initiate octreotide
therapy, thereby leading to overestimation of survival in
the octreotide group. Although the same bias would have
applied to the group of patients with carcinoid syndrome
who did not receive octreotide and the direction of bias is
unclear, this less-restricted approach likely results in a
more heterogeneous study cohort. Due to the above concerns, we made a decision to limit the time window of observation to 6 months so that the carcinoid syndrome is
Cancer

more likely to be associated with the initial diagnosis of
NET, which makes the study cohort less heterogeneous.
Patient demographics included age (65 years-69
years, 70 years-74 years, 75 years-79 years, and  80
years), sex (male vs female), race/ethnicity (non-Hispanic
white, non-Hispanic black, and all others), region (Northeast, West, Midwest, or South), and urban/rural status
(metropolitan vs nonmetropolitan). The Deyo-Romano
modified Charlson comorbidity score was derived from
Medicare Provider Analysis and Review, Outpatient and
Carriers claims files during the 12 months preceding diagnosis and categorized into 3 groups: 0, 1, or at least 2.14-17
This is an algorithm commonly adopted in studies using
claims data, such as the SEER-Medicare data. Patients’
neighborhood socioeconomic status was measured in 2
variables in terms of quartiles: median household income
and percentage living in poverty.
Statistical Analysis

We conducted separate analyses for patients with NETs at
distant stage and those at local/regional stage. This was
driven by 3 considerations. First, these 2 groups of
patients had a highly heterogeneous clinical presentation
of diseases and thus a pooled analysis combining both
groups could mask important differences between the
groups. Second, given the disproportionally higher percentage of patients receiving octreotide LAR among those
with distant-stage disease, the pooled analysis could encounter a high collinearity problem with the use of octreotide LAR and stage variables. Finally, carcinoid syndrome
is generally believed to be rare among patients with local/
regional disease and many such patients may have occult
metastatic disease or other causes for diarrhea. Group differences in the use of octreotide LAR were tested with chisquare statistics. We also used a multivariate logistic
regression analysis to explore factors associated with the

use of octreotide LAR and presented findings as adjusted
odds ratios (ORs) and their corresponding 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs). We explored the association
between octreotide LAR use and survival. Both KaplanMeier estimation and the Cox proportional hazards
model were used in survival analyses. The hazards ratios
(HRs) and corresponding 95% CIs were reported for 5year survival. In addition, we conducted a sensitivity analysis that excluded patients with unknown/mixed tumor
histology. All statistical analyses were conducted using
SAS statistical software (version 9.3; SAS Institute Inc,
Cary NC).
RESULTS
Table 2 provides descriptive statistics of the study cohorts.
It should be noted that some numbers and percentages
were masked in this descriptive table because of data confidentiality requirements by the SEER-Medicare database.
The table shows that of 1291 elderly patients with functional NETs, 484 were diagnosed at distant stage and 807
were diagnosed at local/regional stage. Approximately
50.6% of the patients with distant-stage disease (245
patients) initiated octreotide LAR treatment within 6
months of diagnosis compared with 10.0%81 of patients
with local/regional stage. For the patients with distantstage disease, the bivariate analysis demonstrated that
there were statistically significant differences in the use of
octreotide LAR by age (P 5 .033), sex (P 5 .021), geographic region (P 5 .002), primary cancer site (P < .001),
chemotherapy (P < .001), and census tract median
income (P 5 .013). For the patients with local/regional
disease stage, the bivariate analysis did not detect significant differences in explanatory variables other than chemotherapy and surgery between patients who received
octreotide LAR and those who did not.
Table 3 presents results from the multivariate logistic regression analysis that explored factors associated with
the use of octreotide LAR. For the patients with distantstage disease, older age (OR, 0.43; 95% CI, 0.23-0.814
for patients aged  80 years compared with patients aged
65 years-69 years), female sex (OR, 0.62; 95% CI, 0.400.97), and living in the South (OR, 0.36; 95% CI, 0.180.72 compared with the Northeast) were found to make a
patient less likely to receive treatment with octreotide
LAR. Patients with the small intestine (OR, 4.78; 95%
CI, 2.10-10.92), pancreas (OR, 9.91; 95% CI, 4.1223.83), and others (OR, 5.53; 95% CI, 2.22-13.76) as
their primary cancer site were more likely to receive
octreotide LAR compared with those in whom the lung or
other respiratory organs were the primary cancer site.
2042

Patients who received chemotherapy (OR, 4.74; 95% CI,
2.85-7.90) were also more likely to receive octreotide
LAR. For patients with local/regional stage of disease,
patients aged > 80 years (OR, 0.36; 95% CI, 0.18-0.72),
those living in South (OR, 0.31; 95% CI, 0.12-0.75), and
those who underwent surgery (OR, 0.33; 95% CI, 0.170.65) were less likely to receive octreotide LAR. Similar to
patients with distant-stage disease, those with local/regional stage who were treated with chemotherapy (OR,
7.98; 95% CI, 4.28-14.89) were also more likely to
receive octreotide LAR.
Unadjusted Kaplan-Meier estimation (Figs. 1
and 2) shows that patients with distant-stage disease who
received octreotide LAR treatment within 6 months of the
index date had better survival (P 5 .002, log-rank test).
Patients who received octreotide LAR treatment had a
median survival of 2.11 years (95% CI, 1.73 years-2.84
years), whereas patients who did not receive octreotide
LAR had a median survival of 1.25 years (95% CI, 0.72
years-1.71 years). No significant survival benefit was
found among the group of patients with NETs of local/regional stage.
We then used the Cox proportional hazards model
to examine the association between the use of octreotide
LAR and survival while controlling for tumor characteristics, patient demographic factors, and neighborhood socioeconomic status. The results are presented in Tables 4
and 5, respectively, for patients with distant-stage and
local/regional stage disease. We found that treatment with
octreotide LAR remained significantly associated with
better 5-year survival (HR, 0.61; 95% CI, 0.47-0.79
[P < .001]) for the patients with distant-stage disease. For
patients with local/regional stage disease, the adjusted
analysis found no significant association between 5-year
survival and the use of octreotide LAR (HR, 0.88; 95%
CI, 0.57-1.36 [P 5 .563]). We also found that older age
and not determined/unknown/mixed histology tumor
grade were significantly negatively associated with 5-year
survival whereas surgery was significantly positively associated with 5-year survival for both patients with distantstage and local/regional stage disease. Among patients
with distant-stage disease, having the colon, cecum, appendix, and others as the primary cancer site was found to
be significantly associated with worse 5-year survival. Sensitivity analyses excluding patients with unknown/mixed
histology demonstrated that our main results were robust.

that approximately one-half of the patients at distant stage
initiated octreotide LAR therapy within 6 months of diagnosis. In addition, the results of the current study demonstrated that the use of octreotide LAR within 6 months
from the date of diagnosis of carcinoid syndrome was
associated with better survival outcomes for patients with
distant-stage disease with functional NETs, although no
significant survival benefit of octreotide LAR was found
in patients with local/regional stage disease. The low rate
of octreotide LAR use observed in the current study raised
a concern that many elderly patients with functional
NETs may be undertreated. Such undertreatment could
result in suboptimal control of hormonal symptoms,
decreased quality of life, and possibly shortened survival.
This finding suggests that improved education and dissemination are needed to improve the management of carcinoid syndrome.
The lack of a survival benefit noted among patients
with local/regional disease has several plausible explanations. First, the analyses were limited by the small sample
sizes of patients who were treated with octreotide LAR in
this subgroup (ie, 81 patients, which is 10% of the total of
patients with local/regional stage disease in the current
study). In addition, most experts believe real carcinoid
syndrome among patients with local/regional NETs is
quite rare. This raises the possibility that some cases are
due to occult distant metastatic disease confounding the
analysis in this group. Others may have been diagnosed
with carcinoid syndrome in error.
Although clinical factors, such as the primary cancer
site, strongly predicted the use of octreotide LAR among
patients with distant-stage disease, the patterns of use

were also affected by nonclinical factors, including age,
sex, and geographic regions. We found that use of octreotide LAR was lowest among patients aged  80 years. The
availability of transportation may play a role because drug
administration usually requires monthly visits to a medical oncology office, which could be especially burdensome
for patients in this age group who are likely to already
have several physician visits per month as a result of multiple chronic conditions. This may also reflect physicians’
preference toward a more conservative treatment
approach for these older-age patients. We also found sex
differences in the use of octreotide LAR for patients with
distant-stage disease, with significantly lower ORs
observed among female patients. An exploratory analysis
comparing the age distribution between male and female
patients indicated no significant difference, thereby
excluding the possibility of age-sex interactions. We are
not sure what contributed to the sex difference observed
in the current study and to the best of our knowledge the
cancer literature provides little information regarding sex
disparities because several more prevalent cancers are sexspecific. However, this finding is consistent with sex disparities reported in patients with kidney and heart diseases, with studies demonstrating that women tended to
be less likely to receive costly medical technologies, such
as renal transplantation and specific diagnostic or therapeutic interventions for heart disease.18-20 In addition, we
observed significant differences in the patterns of use
between patients with distant-stage disease residing in the
South and those in the Northeast. It is not clear what
caused a substantially lower rate of use in the South
among patients with distant-stage disease (30.26% in the

South vs 51.84% in the Northeast). Studies have shown
that access to oncologists has a significant impact on
chemotherapy use.21 Future research should explore factors such as sex differences and geographic variations in
access to oncologist services or in prescription preferences.
The finding of a positive association between octreotide LAR use and survival among patients with distantstage NETs with carcinoid syndrome is supported by
findings from prior studies. For example, in a study of
outcomes among patients with NETs in the larger SEER
database, a significant improvement in median overall
survival was observed when comparing the periods before
and after the commercial introduction of octreotide LAR
(18 months vs 39 months; P < .001) among patients with
distant metastatic disease.5 Similar to the current study,
no differences in survival were observed during the same
periods among patients with local/regional disease. In the
placebo-controlled PROMID study, the use of octreotide
LAR among patients with midgut NETs with advanced
disease demonstrated signs of benefit in terms of time to
disease progression, although the PROMID study could
not demonstrate a survival advantage due to its small size
and crossover.7 More recently, CLARINET, a phase 3
study of a different somatostatin analog, lanreotide, also
reported improvements in progression-free survival
among patients with enteropancreatic NETs.22
The current study was based on SEER-Medicare
claims data, and therefore was constrained by the availability and accuracy of the information available in claims
data. For example, time to disease recurrence and time to
disease progression cannot be accurately determined.
Therefore, we were not able to assess the effect of octreotide treatment on progression-free survival or disease-free
survival. Miscoding could be present in identifying the
presence of carcinoid syndrome, especially among
patients with local/regional disease. Furthermore, because
of the nature of retrospective data, the survival benefit estimated from the current study could be subject to biases
from unobserved confounding; this should be validated in
prospective and randomized trial studies. The current
study focused on the elderly population. Based on the
SEER registry data,23 a large percentage (48%) of patients
with advanced NETs are aged  65 years. Future research
should explore whether findings from the current study
are applicable to the nonelderly patients with NETs. The
time period of the current analysis also predates the
reporting of the PROMID and CLARINET studies. Data
from these studies suggesting an antiproliferative effect
may further increase the appropriate use of somatostatin
analogues, leading to the more frequent use of octreotide
2048

than what was observed in the current study. This topic
will be important to address in future research when data
from more recent years become available. Nevertheless, to
the best of our knowledge, the current study is the first
population-based study to document the real-world patterns of use of octreotide LAR among elderly patients
with NETs with carcinoid syndrome, and found a possible survival benefit for these patients, especially for those
with distant-stage disease.
