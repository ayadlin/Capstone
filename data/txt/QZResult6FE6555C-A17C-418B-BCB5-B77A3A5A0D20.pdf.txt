Abstract:

Recent clinical trials with selective inhibitors of the BRAF and MEK kinases have
shown promising results in patients with tumors harboring BRAF V600 mutations.
However, as has been observed previously with similarly successful targeted
therapies, acquired resistance to these agents is an emerging problem that limits
their clinical benefit. Several recent studies from our laboratory and others have
investigated the causes of acquired resistance to BRAF and MEK inhibitors, and
multiple resistance mechanisms have been identified. Here, we review these
mechanisms and suggest that they can be broadly grouped into two main classes:
ERK-dependent and ERK-independent. We also propose distinct therapeutic
strategies that might be employed to overcome each class of acquired resistance.

The RAF-MEK-ERK pathway and
cancer

most often in KRAS, followed by NRAS) are the most
common oncogenic mutations observed thus far in human
cancer [4]. Similarly, activating BRAF mutations are
found in ~7% of human cancers, with particularly high
frequency in melanoma (50-70%), papillary thyroid
cancers (40%), and colorectal cancers (10-15%) [5]. Over
95% of BRAF mutations are point mutations involving
valine 600 (V600) with more than 90% of these mutations
encoding a substitution of V600 with a glutamic acid
(V600E). BRAF V600 mutations lead to constitutive
BRAF kinase activity and can promote oncogenesis
in mouse tumor models [6-9]. As a result, considerable
effort has been devoted to the development of therapeutic
strategies directed against mutant BRAF and its key
effectors.

The RAF-MEK-ERK pathway regulates many
important cellular processes (reviewed in [1-3]).
Classically, signaling through this pathway is driven
by growth factor receptor activation of RAS family
GTPases, including HRAS, KRAS, and NRAS. Activated
RAS proteins can complex with and activate members
of the RAF kinase family—ARAF, BRAF, and CRAF.
Once activated, RAF kinases phosphorylate and activate
the MEK (mitogen-activated or extracellular signalrelated protein kinase kinase) kinases, MEK1 and MEK2,
which subsequently phosphorylate and activate ERK1
and ERK2. ERK (extracellular signal-regulated kinase)
kinases phosphorylate a number of substrates with critical
roles in regulating gene expression, proliferation, and cell
survival.
Consistent with its role as a key regulatory pathway
for cell survival and proliferation, RAF-MEK-ERK
signaling is frequently dysregulated in cancer. RAFMEK-ERK signaling can be driven by aberrant activation
of growth factor receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) or by
oncogenic mutations of intracellular components of this
pathway. Indeed, activating RAS mutations (occurring

BRAF and MEK inhibitors in the
treatment of BRAF mutant

Preclinical data has demonstrated that most BRAF
mutant human tumor-derived cell lines are exquisitely
sensitive to pharmacologic inhibition of RAF-MEKERK signaling. Thus, selective BRAF and MEK kinase
inhibitors potently block cell proliferation and induce

apoptosis in BRAF mutant cancer models and show high
selectivity for cancers with BRAF mutations [10-12]. As
a result, several BRAF and MEK inhibitors are currently
in clinical development. Consistent with preclinical
observations, while early clinical trials with RAF and
MEK inhibitors in unselected patient populations
produced few responses [13-15], recent clinical trials
have focused on administering these agents specifically
to patients with BRAF mutant tumors and have produced
encouraging results. In a Phase I/II trial of the selective
BRAF inhibitor PLX4032 in melanoma patients harboring
the BRAF V600 mutation, 81% of patients achieved an
objective response (defined as a reduction in tumor size
of at least 30%) [16]. Interestingly, in a small study of
25 BRAF V600 mutant colorectal cancer patients treated
with PLX4032, only 1 patient (5%) achieved a partial
response, with an additional 4 patients (20%) achieving
stable disease, suggesting that different tumor types may
exhibit varied dependence on mutant BRAF [17]. Another
selective BRAF inhibitor GSK2118436 produced a
60% response rate in patients with BRAF V600 mutant
melanomas [18]. In early studies, the MEK inhibitor
GSK1120212 produced a 21% response rate in BRAF
V600 mutant melanoma patients [19]. While this response
rate was lower than that observed for the two selective
BRAF inhibitors mentioned above, an additional 54%
of patients achieved stable disease with GSK1120212,
suggesting that MEK inhibitors may still play an important
clinical role in the treatment of BRAF mutant cancers.
One potential reason that BRAF inhibitors have
shown higher response rates than MEK inhibitors in BRAF
V600 mutant melanomas relates to a unique characteristic
of RAF signaling that was elucidated during the past
year by several elegant studies [20-22]. These groups
found that while BRAF inhibitors potently inhibited ERK
phosphorylation in BRAF V600 mutant cells, BRAF
inhibitors failed to inhibit, and in some cases paradoxically
increased, levels of phosphorylated ERK (P-ERK) in cells
with wild-type BRAF. Activation of P-ERK by BRAF
inhibitors in BRAF wild-type cells was more pronounced
in cells with active RAS, either due to RAS mutation or
to activation of RAS by upstream signaling components,
such as RTKs. While mutant BRAF signals as a monomer,
these groups found that in the presence of active RAS,
wild-type BRAF forms homodimers or heterodimers
with other RAF proteins, such as CRAF. When a BRAF
inhibitor binds to one member of a RAF dimer, it blocks
the catalytic activity of the protein to which it is bound,
but it also induces transactivation of the inhibitor-free
member of the RAF dimer, leading to an increase in
catalytic activity and enhanced phosphorylation of the
RAF substrate MEK. As a result, P-ERK inhibition by
BRAF inhibitors is restricted to BRAF mutant cells,
enabling a high dose of BRAF inhibitor to be administered
without causing the toxic effects of ERK inhibition in
normal tissues. Conversely, MEK inhibitors inhibit ERK
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

phosphorylation in all cells, potentially leading to toxicity
caused by suppression of P-ERK in normal tissues, and
consequently limiting the dose that can be administered in
patients. In other words, the narrower therapeutic window
of MEK inhibitors may explain why BRAF inhibitors
have produced higher response rates than MEK inhibitors
in patients with BRAF mutant tumors.
While the initial response rates seen in BRAF
mutant melanomas with BRAF and MEK inhibitors are
encouraging, previous experience with similarly effective
targeted therapies predicts that acquired drug resistance
will be a major factor limiting the clinical benefit of
these agents. Indeed, despite dramatic initial responses,
the median time to progression of patients treated
with PLX4032 was 7 months [16]. Understanding the
mechanisms by which patients’ tumors acquire resistance
to targeted therapies can potentially lead to strategies to
overcome resistance. Accordingly, significant effort has
been devoted recently to studying acquired resistance to
BRAF and MEK inhibitors in BRAF mutant cancers.

Acquired resistance to BRAF and
MEK inhibitors
Preclinical modeling of acquired drug resistance
has been a useful tool for predicting the resistance
mechanisms that emerge in patients receiving targeted
cancer therapies. Previously, this approach has predicted
the resistance mechanisms that occur clinically in many
instances, including erlotinib-resistance in EGFR mutant
lung cancer, imatinib-resistance in BCR-ABL translocated
leukemia, resistance to Smoothened inhibitors in
Patched1-deficient medulloblastoma, and resistance to
ALK inhibitors in ALK-translocated lung cancers [2328]. In several cases, these findings have led to strategies
to overcome resistance, which are now being used in the
clinic.
To date, preclinical modeling has identified multiple
potential mechanisms of acquired resistance to BRAF or
MEK inhibitors (Fig. 1), and some of these mechanisms
have been validated clinically. In general, these resistance
mechanisms, reviewed below, fall into two broad
categories—those that retain their dependence on ERK
signaling and those that do not. We will refer to these
two classes as ERK-dependent and ERK-independent
mechanisms of acquired resistance.

ERK-dependent mechanisms

The vast majority of acquired resistance mechanisms
to BRAF or MEK inhibitors that have been identified to date
lead to reactivation of ERK signaling despite the presence
of inhibitor. This finding underscores the importance of
ERK signaling for the continued proliferation and survival
337

of BRAF mutant cancer cells. In general, mechanisms
of acquired resistance to targeted therapies commonly
employ either mutation or amplification of the drug
target itself or alterations which do not involve the drug
target but that activate parallel or downstream signaling
pathways to circumvent the activity of the drug [23-34]. In
resistant BRAF mutant tumor models, examples of each of
these common mechanisms has been identified in resistant
BRAF mutant tumor models that lead to reactivation of
ERK signaling.

patient’s AZD6244-resistant melanoma, also led to crossresistance to BRAF inhibitors, presumably by causing
activation of MEK downstream of BRAF. Interestingly,
later work by this same group identified a different MEK1
point mutation (C121S) in a post-relapse biopsy from a
patient with clinically acquired resistance to the BRAF
inhibitor PLX4032, demonstrating that MEK1 mutations
can arise as a potential mechanism of acquired resistance
to BRAF inhibitors as well [36]. Interestingly, although
the MEK1 P124L point mutation conferred resistance
to MEK or BRAF inhibitors alone, the combination of
a MEK inhibitor and BRAF inhibitor could overcome
resistance in this setting.
To date, no secondary BRAF mutations have been
identified in BRAF inhibitor-resistant pre-clinical models
or in biopsies from patients with clinically acquired
BRAF inhibitor resistance. Nazarian et al screened twelve
tumor biopsies from patients with clinically acquired
resistance to PLX4032 and did not observe any secondary
BRAF mutations [37]. “Ultra-deep” sequencing of these
tumors also failed to reveal any evidence of secondary
BRAF mutations. Notably, the BRAF T529 “gatekeeper”
mutation has been shown to confer resistance to BRAF
inhibition when introduced into BRAF mutant cell
lines and in genetically engineered mouse models [38].
Therefore, while it is possible that secondary BRAF
mutations may be identified as more tumors with acquired
resistance to BRAF inhibitors are analyzed, it does not
appear that secondary BRAF mutations are a common
cause of acquired BRAF inhibitor resistance in the clinic.

Point mutations in MEK1
Emery et al identified a MEK1 point mutation in a
resistant focus of disease in a patient with V600E mutant
melanoma who had originally responded to the MEK
inhibitor AZD6244 [35]. Through a mutagenesis screen of
MEK1, the authors also identified several additional point
mutations that could potentially lead to MEK inhibitor
resistance. The majority of these mutations clustered
within or near the allosteric drug-binding pocket and were
hypothesized to interfere with inhibitor binding. Other
point mutations were identified outside of the drug-binding
pocket and were thought to influence intrinsic MEK
kinase activity or to affect protein conformation. These
point mutations severely attenuated the ability of MEK
inhibitors to inhibit ERK phosphorylation. Some MEK1

While secondary mutations in BRAF have not been
identified as a cause of BRAF or MEK inhibitor resistance,
our laboratory recently identified selective amplification
of the mutant BRAF allele as the mechanism underlying
acquired resistance in two independent BRAF mutant
colorectal cancer cell lines selected for resistance to
the MEK inhibitor AZD6244 [39]. BRAF amplification
was also recently identified by another laboratory as the
mechanism of acquired resistance to MEK inhibitors
in a different BRAF mutant colorectal cell line model,
corroborating these findings [40]. Resistant BRAFamplified clones were also cross-resistant to BRAF
inhibitors, although to a slightly lesser degree. Surprisingly,
even though MEK inhibitors act downstream of BRAF,
BRAF gene amplification dramatically reduced the ability
of AZD6244 to inhibit ERK phosphorylation and, as a
consequence, to inhibit cell proliferation and survival.
Although BRAF amplification arose as an acquired
resistance mechanism in vitro, BRAF amplification has
not been identified as a mechanism of acquired resistance
in clinical samples, given that few MEK inhibitor-resistant
tumor biopsies are available. However, we identified
pre-existing BRAF amplification in a treatment-naive

BRAF mutant colorectal cancer, suggesting that BRAF
amplification could also be a cause of de novo resistance
to BRAF and MEK inhibitors in the clinic.
We found that the mechanism by which BRAF
amplification led to BRAF and MEK inhibitor resistance
hinged upon hyperactivation of MEK. We observed that
the levels of phosphorylated MEK (P-MEK) in resistant
cells were 5 to 6 times higher than the basal levels seen
in parental cells. Careful evaluation of the dose-response
relationship between BRAF inhibitor treatment and
phosophorylation of MEK and ERK revealed that, in
resistant cells, levels of P-MEK could be reduced by
~50% before any noticeable decrease in P-ERK levels
was observed. This was in stark contrast to parental cells,
in which a ~50% decrease in P-MEK levels led to a ~50%
decrease in P-ERK levels. These findings suggested that
the high levels of P-MEK in resistant cells (driven by
BRAF amplification) were in excess of levels required
for near-maximal ERK phosphorylation. As a result, a
much higher concentration of BRAF or MEK inhibitor
was required to fully suppress ERK phosphorylation in
resistant cells, either by reducing excess P-MEK levels
(as in the case of the BRAF inhibitor) or by inhibiting
excess MEK activity (as in the case of the MEK inhibitor).
However, if resistant cells were treated with a low dose
of BRAF inhibitor sufficient to reduce levels of P-MEK
to amounts observed under basal conditions in parental
cells, the ability of MEK inhibitors to suppress P-ERK
was completely restored. Accordingly, while resistant
cells were insensitive to BRAF or MEK inhibitors
individually, combined BRAF and MEK inhibition fully
overcame resistance and induced dramatic apoptosis and
growth inhibition in these cells. Furthermore, combined
BRAF and MEK inhibition was also more effective in
parental cells, suggesting a possible broader utility for
combinatorial targeting of the RAF-MEK pathway in
BRAF mutant cancers.
This mechanism underlying the resistance to BRAF
and MEK inhibitors caused by BRAF amplification has
potential implications for other models of resistance in
BRAF mutant tumors. Since excess levels of activated
and phosphoryated MEK underlie the mechanism of
resistance to BRAF and MEK inhibitors, it is possible
that other changes that lead to similar degrees of MEK
hyperactivation could cause a similar mode of resistance.
For example, excessive upstream input from receptor
tyrosine kinases (RTKs), RAS or RAF proteins, or other
activators of MEK, could also potentially lead to MEK
hyperactivation and result in similar resistance to BRAF
or MEK inhibitors.

generated in vitro from a BRAF V600 mutant melanoma
cell line, P-ERK levels were maintained despite treatment
with the inhibitor. Elevated CRAF protein levels were
present in resistant clones, relative to drug-sensitive
parental cells, whereas levels of ARAF and BRAF
were unchanged. No CRAF gene amplification and no
increase in CRAF transcript were noted, suggesting that
elevated CRAF levels arose from a post-transcriptional
mechanism. In this model, tumor cells appear to have
switched their dependency from BRAF to CRAF. Thus,
resistant clones were sensitive to CRAF knockdown
or to Hsp90 inhibitors, which down-regulated CRAF
protein levels. CRAF overexpression in parental cells also
produced AZ628 resistance. Interestingly, resistant clones
with elevated CRAF levels retained some sensitivity to
MEK inhibitors, although with reduced potency.

Activating NRAS mutation
Nazarian et al recently identified NRAS mutations as
a mechanism of acquired resistance to the BRAF inhibitor
PLX4032 [37]. NRAS mutations are present in 15-30% of
melanomas, but are rarely coincident with BRAF mutations
[42, 43]. Cell lines resistant to PLX4032 were derived
from three melanoma cell lines with BRAF mutations.
In one of these cell lines, an NRAS Q61K mutation was
identified. An NRAS Q61K mutation was also identified
in an isolated nodal metastasis from a patient with BRAF
mutant melanoma, which progressed after an initial
response to PLX4032. Interestingly, a distinct NRAS
mutation (Q61R) was identified in a second progression
site in the same patient. In resistant cells in vitro, both
P-MEK and P-ERK levels were maintained despite the
presence of BRAF inhibitor. It is therefore likely that
mutant NRAS leads to activation of MEK by signaling
through RAF isoforms other than BRAF. However, both
the PLX4032-resistant cell line and a short-term culture
line from the above patient’s resistant disease focus—
each harboring an acquired NRAS mutation—retained
sensitivity to MEK inhibitor alone and to the combination
of PLX4032 and a MEK inhibitor. Interestingly, in early
clinical trials with MEK inhibitors in unselected patient
populations, responses to single agent MEK inhibitor
were observed in patients with NRAS mutant melanomas,
including one complete response [15]. These data suggest
that MEK inhibitors or a RAF/MEK inhibitor combination
could be a potential therapy to overcome NRAS-mediated
resistance to BRAF inhibitors.

phosphorylation to a similar degree as it did in the parental
cell lines. The ability of these resistant cell line models
to proliferate and survive despite suppression of P-ERK
by PLX4032 suggested activation of “ERK-independent”
proliferation and survival signals. Consistent with the
lack of dependence on the ERK pathway demonstrated
by these resistant cell line models, treatment with a
MEK inhibitor or combined MEK and BRAF inhibition
failed to overcome resistance, as it did with the ERKdependent models discussed above. Comparison of
the microarray gene expression profiles of parental and
resistant cells revealed overexpression of several RTKs
in the resistant cells, including KIT, MET, EGFR and
PDGFRβ. Of these four RTKs, only EGFR and PDGFRβ
showed increased protein expression in the resistant cell
lines, and only PDGFRβ displayed increased activationassociated tyrosine phosphorylation in resistant cells.
Importantly, the authors found that four of eleven clinical
post-relapse biopsies from melanoma patients treated
with PLX4032 showed increased PDGFRβ expression,
relative to pre-treatment biopsies. To validate PDGFRβ
as the cause of resistance in their cell line models, the
authors demonstrated that RNAi-mediated knockdown of
PDGFRβ in resistant cells led to growth inhibition in the
presence of PLX4032. However, PDGFRβ knockdown
did not restore an apoptotic response in these cells in
the presence of PLX4032, suggesting that PDGFRβ
overexpression may not be the only mechanism of
resistance in these cells. Consistent with this possibility,
the combination of the PDGFRβ inhibitor imatinib and
PLX4032 did not restore sensitivity to resistant cell lines.
Therefore, it is conceivable that an additional mechanism
could be contributing to resistance, possibly involving
one of the other RTKs whose expression was increased in
resistant cells. Still, this model of resistance demonstrates
that BRAF or MEK inhibitor resistance can arise in the
absence of ERK reactivation and that RTKs may promote
resistance through activation of ERK-independent
proliferation and survival pathways.

in sensitive BRAF V600E melanoma cell lines [44]. Nine
kinases were identified, two of which caused P-MEK and
P-ERK levels to be maintained despite the presence of
PLX4720. These two kinases were CRAF (consistent with
the findings of Montagut et al, above [41]) and COT/Tpl2,
encoded by MAP3K8. These data suggest that activation
of MEK-ERK signaling by COT represents a novel RAFindependent mechanism of MEK activation. Interestingly,
COT levels were observed to increase in cell lines
treated with BRAF inhibitors, suggesting that COT may
be involved with feedback regulation of MEK activity.
Consistent with these findings, in the biopsies of two of
three patients taken during treatment with PLX4032, COT
transcript levels were elevated relative to pre-treatment
biopsies. In one patient who was biopsied post-relapse,
levels of COT transcript were elevated relative to pretreatment and on-treatment biopsies, suggesting that COT
may contribute to acquired resistance to BRAF inhibitors
in the clinic. The authors also identified two cell lines with
copy number gains at the MAP3K8 locus that expressed
high levels of COT. These cell lines were resistant to
PLX4720. Interestingly, even though COT appears to
activate ERK through MEK, these cell lines and cell lines
overxpressing exogenous COT were also resistant to MEK
inhibitors. One possible explanation for this observation is
that high COT levels might contribute to MEK inhibitor
resistance by causing MEK hyperactivation, similar to
the mechanism observed for BRAF amplification [39].
Accordingly, combined BRAF and MEK inhibition was
able to overcome resistance caused by elevated COT
levels.

ERK-independent
resistance

mechanisms

of

acquired

As discussed above, the majority of the resistance
mechanisms to BRAF and MEK inhibition that have been
identified lead to ERK reactivation and retain dependence
on ERK signaling. While this underscores the importance
of the RAF-MEK-ERK pathway in melanoma proliferation
and survival, in the last few months several examples of
resistance mechanisms have been reported that do not rely
on sustained ERK signaling, indicating that other “ERKindependent” pathways can compensate for loss of ERK
activity and can maintain the tumorigenicity of BRAF
V600E melanoma in the absence of ERK activation.

IGF1R activation
Villanueva et al recently identified another RTKdriven resistance mechanism through in vitro modeling
of BRAF inhibitor resistance in BRAF V600E melanoma
cell lines [45]. In cell lines made resistant to the BRAF
inhibitor SB-590885, P-ERK was no longer suppressed
by BRAF inhibition, suggesting activation of MEK-ERK
signaling through another RAF isoform. Interestingly,
knockdown of individual RAF isoforms revealed that no
dominant RAF isoform controlled MEK-ERK signaling
in resistant cells, unlike the situation observed with
CRAF by Montagut et al [41]. Rather, P-ERK could only
be suppressed if all three RAF isoforms were inhibited
simultaneously. Alternatively, MEK inhibition was also
capable of blocking ERK phosphorylation. These findings

PDGFRβ overexpression
In the recent study by Nazarian et al, discussed
above, of the three BRAF mutant melanoma cell lines
made resistant to PLX4032, one resistant cell line was
found to have acquired an NRAS mutation and maintained
P-ERK levels despite the presence of BRAF inhibitor
[37]. In the other two models, PLX4032 inhibited ERK

suggest that ERK is still activated in a MEK-dependent
manner in the resistant cells, but that activation of MEK
can proceed through any of the three RAF isoforms,
consistent with activation of an upstream activator of
RAF signaling. However, despite complete inhibition of
P-ERK, MEK inhibition produced only cytostatic effects
on resistant cells and failed to induce apoptosis, as it did in
parental cells, suggesting activation of an ERK-dependent
survival pathway in the resistant cells.
Because RTKs can signal through multiple RAF
isoforms by activation of RAS proteins, and since RTKs
activate multiple signaling pathways in addition to RAFMEK-ERK, the authors investigated whether resistant
cells showed differences in RTK phosphorylation relative
to parental cells. More than one RTK exhibiting differential
phosphorylation was identified by phospho-RTK array
analysis, including IGF1R. However, pharmacologic
inhibition of IGF1R decreased proliferation of resistant
cells, and combined inhibition of IGF1R and MEK induced
dramatic apoptosis, suggesting that ERK-independent
survival signaling was mediated by IGF1R in resistant
cells. While surface expression of IGF1R was found
to be increased in resistant cells, the exact mechanism
leading to increased IGF1R activation was not identified.
In addition to activating the RAF-MEK-ERK pathway,
IGF1R and other RTKs are known to activate PI3K-AKT
signaling, which is known to be an important regulator
of cell survival and proliferation [46, 47]. Resistant
cells displayed elevated levels of phosphorylated AKT
(P-AKT) compared to parental cells, and IGF1R inhibition
could reduce P-AKT levels in resistant cells. Combined
pharmacologic inhibition of PI3K and MEK was also able
to induce apoptosis in resistant cells, indicating that the
PI3K-AKT pathway mediated ERK-independent survival
signals in these resistant cell line models.
Taken together, these two models of resistance
driven by RTKs indicate that RTK-mediated resistance
to BRAF or MEK inhibition highlights the complexity
of signaling in resistant cells. Although in each resistance
model, a dominant RTK was identified (e.g. PDGFRβ or
IGF1R) that contributed to the majority of the signaling
changes and to the decrease in drug sensitivity observed
in resistant cells, there was evidence in each model that
additional signaling pathways, perhaps involving other
RTKs, were contributing to resistance. First, in each model,
multiple RTKs were found to be elevated or to display
increased phosphorylation, suggesting that other RTKs
could contribute in some way to resistance. Second, in
each model, inhibition of the dominant RTK, either using
pharmacologic inhibitors or RNAi-mediated knockdown,
was not sufficient to completely reverse all of the changes
in signaling and sensitivity seen in the resistant cells.
In the study by Nazarian et al, PDGFRβ knockdown
blocked proliferation, but failed to induce apoptosis, even
in the presence of BRAF inhibitor [37]. Furthermore,
pharmacologic inhibition of PDGFRβ with imatinib did
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

not restore sensitivity of resistant cells in the presence or
absence of BRAF inhibitor. In the study by Villanueva et
al, pharmacologic inhibition of IGF1R in combination
with MEK was able to restore an apoptotic response in
resistant cells [45]. However, inhibition of IGF1R could
not restore the ability of BRAF inhibitor to suppress
P-ERK, and, as a result, the addition of BRAF inhibitor
did not lead to a greater reduction in cell viability
compared to IGF1R inhibition alone. These findings
suggest that the signaling through multiple RAF isoforms
to MEK observed in resistant cells may not be due to
increased IGF1R activation, but rather may involve other
signals, perhaps from one of the other RTKs (e.g. MET)
noted to demonstrate increased phosphorylation in their
analysis of resistant cells. The complexity of each of these
RTK-driven resistance models indicates that both the
identification and subsequent targeting of the responsible
RTK may be challenging in patients with BRAF mutant
cancers who relapse while on treatment with BRAF or
MEK inhibitors.
One potential strategy to overcome this problem
would be to target common signaling nodes activated by
RTKs in resistant cells, rather than attempting to target
specific RTKs. In addition to activating RAF-MEK
signaling, the PI3K-AKT pathway is a major signaling
output of RTKs, and several studies have shown that
inhibiting PI3K signaling in combination with RAF-MEK
signaling is sufficient to induce apoptosis and suppress
proliferation in RTK-driven cancer models [48-50].
Accordingly, as demonstrated by Villanueva et al, treatment
of resistant cells with increased IGF1R activation with
the combination of PI3K and MEK inhibitors restored an
apoptotic response [45]. While this inhibitor combination
was not tested in the PDGFRβ-driven resistance model
discussed above, one might predict that combined PI3K
and RAF-MEK inhibition would overcome resistance in
this model as well. In support of this hypothesis, another
in vitro model of BRAF inhibitor resistance in BRAF
mutant melanoma was recently reported by Jiang et al
[51]. While the exact mechanism of resistance was not
identified, the mechanism appeared highly dependent on
extracellular signals and serum concentration, and resistant
cells showed increased levels of P-AKT, suggesting
that activation of PI3K signaling, perhaps by RTKs,
could also be involved in promoting resistance. In this
model, treatment of resistant cells with the combination
of a PI3K inhibitor and a BRAF inhibitor was able to
overcome resistance. Collectively, these results suggest
that co-targeting the PI3K and RAF-MEK pathways
could constitute a potential strategy to overcome ERKindependent mechanisms of BRAF or MEK inhibitor
resistance, including RTK-driven resistance.

Strategies

and

Therapeutic

strategy for patients who relapse on single-agent BRAF
or MEK inhibitor would be to treat with the combination
of a BRAF and a MEK inhibitor if their tumor harbors
an ERK-dependent resistance mechanism or to treat
with the combination of a PI3K inhibitor and a MEK or
BRAF inhibitor if their resistant tumor is driven by an
ERK-independent mechanism. Since each of these drug
combinations is currently being evaluated in clinical
trials, with similar combination trials being planned, it
is feasible that this basic strategy could be implemented
at the present time [52]. In addition, newer agents in
development, such as ERK inhibitors, may also play a
role in therapeutic approaches to overcome resistance in
the future.
However, in order to apply this basic therapeutic
strategy most effectively, it would first be necessary to
identify whether the mechanism driving a given patient’s
resistant tumor is ERK-dependent or ERK-independent.
For this reason, routinely obtaining biopsies from
recurrent tumors in patients treated with BRAF or MEK
inhibitors will likely be important for the selection of
the most appropriate therapy post-relapse, as has been
done for acquired resistance to other targeted therapies
[53]. Particularly as the frequencies of specific resistance
mechanisms in BRAF mutant cancers become better
understood, focused analysis of biopsies from resistant
tumor foci for common resistance mechanisms might
allow identification of the cause of drug resistance and
could guide second-line therapy.
Still, while it might be feasible to screen tissue

While the recent clinical successes of BRAF and
MEK inhibitors in BRAF mutant cancers are encouraging,
many of the responses to therapy have been short-lived
due to rapid development of acquired resistance [16]. As
a result, there is an urgent clinical need for therapeutic
strategies for patients with BRAF mutant cancers who
eventually progress on BRAF or MEK inhibitor therapy.
The in vitro resistance models reviewed herein suggest that
the most appropriate choice of therapy for patients with
recurrent disease may depend on whether that particular
patient’s resistant tumor is driven by an ERK-dependent
or ERK-independent mechanism. As shown in Table 1,
ERK-dependent resistant models retain sensitivity to
combined treatment with BRAF and MEK inhibitors.
It is important to note that, while the combination of
BRAF and MEK inhibitors was not tested in resistant
cells harboring elevated CRAF levels, these resistant
cells retained sensitivity to single agent MEK inhibitor,
suggesting that they would also be sensitive to combined
BRAF and MEK inhibition [41]. Conversely, combined
BRAF and MEK inhibition was not effective when tested
in ERK-independent resistance models, presumably due
to the activation of alternative proliferation and survival
pathways outside of the RAF-MEK axis. Instead,
combined inhibition of PI3K and MEK or PI3K and
BRAF was effective in the ERK-independent models in
Corcoran et al, Table 1
which it was tested. Thus, a reasonable initial clinical

from resistant tumors for a small set of the most common
individual alterations leading to resistance, the above
studies demonstrate that resistance can arise through
numerous specific molecular events. Therefore, especially
as more specific mechanisms of resistance are defined, it
may become unreasonable or even impossible to identify
the specific change driving tumor resistance in every
patient. As a result, an alternative approach might be to
assess resistant tumor specimens for common indicators of
ERK-dependent or ERK-independent resistance, perhaps
by assessing biomarkers of RAF-MEK-ERK or PI3KAKT signaling in a biopsy taken while the patient remains
on treatment. For example, if P-ERK levels remain
suppressed in a resistant tumor biopsy taken in a patient
who remains on therapy (such as seen in the PDGFRβdriven model of Nazarian et al [37]), this finding would
indicate an ERK-independent mechanism, since all ERKdependent mechanisms restore ERK phosphorylation
despite the presence of inhibitor. Lack of P-ERK signal
would suggest that this patient would best be treated with
the combination of a PI3K inhibitor and a MEK or BRAF
inhibitor. However, the presence of P-ERK in a resistant
tumor biopsy does not guarantee an ERK-dependent
mechanism, and thus it would not be possible to determine
based on the presence of P-ERK alone whether a patient
would benefit more from the combination of a MEK and
a BRAF inhibitor or the combination of a PI3K inhibitor
and a BRAF or MEK inhibitor. For example, in the RTKdriven resistance model developed by Villanueva et al, in
addition to the activation of an ERK-independent survival
pathway PI3K via IGF1R, ERK phosphorylation was also
restored in the presence of BRAF inhibitor, likely due to
RTK-driven signals through other RAF isoforms [45].
Therefore, to select the optimal combination strategy,
it might be useful to assess markers of PI3K signaling
in addition to evaluating P-ERK levels. In fact, both
this resistant model and clinical biopsies from resistant
tumor with increased IGF1R activation showed elevated
P-AKT levels. Therefore, while combined BRAF and
MEK inhibition may be a reasonable default treatment for
patients with clinically acquired BRAF or MEK inhibitor
resistance, given that most resistance mechanisms
identified to date involve ERK-dependent mechanisms,
lack of ERK reactivation or the presence of increased
P-AKT levels could indicate cases in which use of a PI3K
and a MEK or BRAF inhibitor might be more effective.
Finally, it is intriguing to speculate that anticipation
of acquired resistance to BRAF or MEK inhibitors could
lead to strategies to prevent resistance from emerging.
Moreover, since it is possible for multiple distinct
resistance mechanisms to arise in the same patient,
employing combination strategies aimed at preventing
resistance as part of a patient’s initial therapy could have
advantages. Recent studies have suggested that combined
BRAF and MEK inhibition is more effective in treatmentnaïve BRAF mutant cancers than treatment with either
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

inhibitor alone [39, 54]. Furthermore, one study showed
that initial treatment with the combination of a BRAF
and MEK inhibitors can prevent or delay emergence of
resistance due to ERK pathway reactivation in BRAF
mutant melanomas [54]. Similarly, initial combined
inhibition of AKT and MEK was also shown to prevent
resistance in BRAF mutant melanoma cell lines that
develop resistance to MEK inhibitors through upregulation
of PI3K-AKT signaling [55]. As a result, clinical trials
assessing combinations of targeted inhibitors for the
initial treatment of BRAF mutant cancers are currently
underway [52]. Thus, identification and understanding of
the mechanisms of resistance to BRAF or MEK inhibitors
in BRAF mutant cancers could not only lead to strategies
to overcome established resistance, but may yield a means
by which to prevent resistance from emerging and to
prolong the clinical response to therapy.
