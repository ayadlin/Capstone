SUMMARY

Author Manuscript

Recent advances in single-particle cryoelecton microscopy (cryo-EM) are enabling generation of
numerous near-atomic-resolution structures for well-ordered protein complexes with sizes ≥ ~200
kDa. Whether cryo-EM methods are equally useful for high-resolution structural analysis of
smaller, dynamic protein complexes such as those involved in cellular metabolism remains an
important question. Here, we present 3.8 Å resolution cryo-EM structures of isocitrate
dehydrogenase (93 kDa) and identify the nature of conformational changes induced by binding of
the allosteric small-molecule inhibitor ML309. We also report 2.8-Å- and 1.8-Å-resolution
structures of the cancer targets lactate dehydrogenase (145 kDa) and glutamate dehydrogenase
(334 kDa), respectively. With these results, two perceived barriers in single-particle cryo-EM are
overcome: our tests demonstrated crossing 2 Å resolution and obtaining maps of proteins with
sizes < 100 kDa, demonstrating that cryo-EM can be used to investigate a broad spectrum of drugtarget interactions and dynamic conformational states.

INTRODUCTION

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

Cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) is now firmly established as a central tool in the
arsenal of structural biology. The ability to obtain near-atomic-resolution structures using
cryo-EM was shown initially almost three decades ago in the context of electron
crystallographic studies of membrane proteins (Henderson et al., 1990). Continued advances
in single-particle cryo-EM over the next two decades enabled resolution analysis of noncrystalline samples with high internal symmetry such as icosahedral and helical viruses (Ge
and Zhou, 2011; Settembre et al., 2011; Yu et al., 2008; Zhang et al., 2010). Large and
relatively stable complexes such as ribosomes also proved especially amenable to analysis
using cryo-EM methods, first at medium resolution (Matadeen et al., 1999; Rawat et al.,
2003) and more recently at near-atomic resolution (Amunts et al., 2014; Fischer et al., 2015;
Jomaa et al., 2016; Wong et al., 2014). These successes have now been extended to a wide
spectrum of protein complexes, including several integral membrane proteins (Bai et al.,
2015b; Du et al., 2015; Liao et al., 2013; Matthies et al., 2016). Structures determined by
cryo-EM can now reach resolutions as high as 2.2 Å and 2.3 Å, as exemplified by structures
of the 465 kDa β-galactosidase (Bartesaghi et al., 2015) and the 540 kDa AAA ATPase p97
(Banerjee et al., 2016). However, all of the near-atomic-resolution structures reported have
been of proteins with sizes in the range of ~200 kDa or larger, and an informal opinion in the
field is that cryo-EM technology is primarily suited for analysis of relatively stable proteins
with sizes >150 kDa (Thompson et al., 2016). The smallest protein for which a cryo-EM
structure has been reported using single particle cryo-EM is that of the 135 kDa ABC
exporter TmrAB, at ~10 Å resolution (Kim et al., 2015), and the challenges in achieving
near-atomic resolution for small proteins, even with sizes as large as ~300 kDa have been
noted (Skiniotis and Southworth, 2016; Cheng, 2015; Belnap, 2015). Crystallographic
analyses are generally very powerful for proteins in this size range but usually require that
flexible regions are either deleted or altered. Given that small, dynamic protein complexes
are implicated in numerous cellular processes, there is considerable interest in determining

whether cryo-EM methods can be also applicable for structural analysis of this class of
proteins under near-native conditions and at near-atomic resolution.

Author Manuscript

A principal reason why small proteins such as those with sizes <150 kDa have been
considered intractable for analysis by cryo-EM is that the errors in alignment of individual
projection images become progressively higher as the size of the scattering entity gets
smaller (Henderson et al., 2011). In principle, with a perfect detector that displays minimal
falloff in detective quantum efficiency (DQE) even at Nyquist frequency (Henderson, 1995;
McMullan et al., 2014), it should be possible to achieve accurate alignment of projection
images of smaller proteins, but all currently available detectors still show a significant drop
in DQE at higher frequencies. The use of phase plates is an option that may help partially
alleviate the problem of image contrast (Danev and Baumeister, 2016), but these
developments are still at an early stage. One way to compensate for the falloff in DQE at
higher spatial frequencies is to collect data at higher magnification. This strategy, however,
lowers contrast and makes the alignment of individual frames collected in movie mode of
data collection more challenging. Experimental approaches to optimize specimen
preparation provide an alternative route to improve image contrast: it can be easier to
minimize the background scattering from the ice layer for smaller proteins because the lower
the molecular weight, the thinner the ice layer that is required to surround the protein with
an aqueous layer.

Author Manuscript

To further test the limits of what is possible with present-day cryo-EM technology, we have
analyzed structures of two small, soluble enzymes implicated in cancer metabolism: the 145
kDa lactate dehydrogenase (LDH B, a tetramer composed of four identical ~36 kDa
subunits) and the 93 kDa isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH1, a dimer composed of two
identical ~47 kDa subunits). In both cases, we tested whether structures can be obtained at
high enough resolution to localize bound small-molecule ligands and to determine the
structures of ligand-bound complexes. We also carried out structural analysis of the
conformationally dynamic enzyme glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH). Earlier
crystallographic analyses of apo-GDH, a 334 kDa hexameric protein composed of six
identical ~56 kDa subunits, have been limited to a resolution of 2.7 Å, possibly because
some regions of the protein may display a continuum of conformational states even in the
context of a crystal lattice. This is a feature that may well be shared by a large majority of
protein complexes involved in signaling and metabolism. While it is expected that image
averaging will limit resolutions that can be achieved for the conformationally flexible
components, it is interesting to ascertain whether cryo-EM analyses can be used to obtain
near-atomic resolution for the ordered regions of these types of protein complexes.

RESULTS
Structural Studies of Lactate Dehydrogenase
Cancer cells catalyze the production of lactate from pyruvate, the final metabolite generated
from glucose during glycolysis. In non-malignant cells, pyruvate enters mitochondria to
participate in the Krebs cycle and in oxidative phosphorylation. Under anaerobic conditions,
such as that found in muscle cells, tetrameric LDH mediates the formation of lactate from
pyruvate using NADH as a cofactor. However, in cancer cells, irrespective of oxygen

availability, glycolysis followed by production of lactate through LDH is the preferred
pathway, enhancing the production of metabolic precursors required for biosynthesis of
cellular macromolecules. The recognition in a growing number of cancers of the central role
of both LDH A and B isoforms (Fiume et al., 2014; McCleland et al., 2013; Rodriguez et al.,
2003) has driven the identification of small-molecule inhibitors, including
mercaptocyclohex-2-enone derivatives that bind away from the NAD-binding pocket and are
not competitive inhibitors (Dragovich et al., 2014), as well as sulfamoylquinoline benzoic
acid derivatives, which compete with NAD binding to LDH (Billiard et al., 2013). To
evaluate the potential of cryo-EM to determine structures of a small protein complex such as
LDH and localize the binding sites of potential small-molecule inhibitors, we carried out
cryo-EM analysis of LDH B in complex with GSK2837808A, a 650 Dalton compound in
the quinoline 3-sulfonamide series (Billiard et al., 2013). These compounds potently inhibit
activity of LDH A and B, as well as isoforms with mixtures of LDH A and B, making them
attractive candidates for use in treatment of solid tumors that rely principally on aerobic
glycolysis for survival.

Author Manuscript

The cryo-EM structure of the LDH B-GSK2837808A complex at an overall resolution of 2.8
Å (Figure S1A; Table 1) enables delineation of the binding site of the inhibitor (Figures 1A–
1C). The location of the compound at the periphery of the protein is in excellent agreement
with the placement of inhibitors in the two X-ray structures (4QSM and 4QT0 at resolutions
of 3.0 Å and 3.2 Å, respectively) that are available for LDH A in complex with quinoline 3sulfonamides (Figures S1B and S1C). The density for the inhibitor is not adequate to model
in a specific conformation, which could be a consequence of high conformational flexibility
coupled with its location at the outer edge of the protein with a high degree of solvent
exposure. Nevertheless, most regions of the polypeptide display density that enables
unambiguous construction of an atomic model for the protein (Figures 1D and 1E),
including localization of numerous water molecules in the density map (Figures S1D and
1E). The fact that the overall quality and resolution of the structure is comparable to, if not
better than, that obtained from X-ray crystallography, validates the potential of cryo-EM to
obtain near-atomic-resolution structures of <150 kDa complexes of this kind, without the
need for crystallization.
Structural Studies of Isocitrate Dehydrogenase

Author Manuscript

The conversion of isocitrate to α-ketoglutarate (αKG) is catalyzed by NADP+-bound IDH1.
IDH1 proteins with mutations at residue Arg132 are found in cancer cells such as those in
glioblastoma. This residue, most often found mutated to a histidine or a cysteine, is critical
for the maintenance of the active site (Dang et al., 2009; Yang et al., 2010). The R132H and
R132C variants of IDH1 lose affinity for isocitrate; instead, with the cofactor NADPH, these
mutants bind αKG and convert it to R(−)-2-hydroxyglutyrate (2HG), an oncometabolite.
ML309 is a potent and selective inhibitor of IDH1 R132H/C, decreasing production of 2HG
in glioblastoma cells (Davis et al., 2014). Although a number of structures of the R132H
mutant exist, structures of IDH Arg132 mutants in complex with the ML309 inhibitor have
not yet been determined. Structural analysis of IDH1 by cryo-EM is technically challenging
given its small size, low symmetry (C2), and potential flexibility.

In Figure 2A, we present a cryo-EM structure for the R132C mutant of IDH1 that shows the
characteristic butterfly fold of the dimer at a nominal resolution of 3.8 Å (Figure S2A). The
polypeptide backbone and densities for the larger side chains are resolved in many regions
(Figures 2B and 2C), enabling placing of the polypeptide chain into the density map using
prior crystal structures of IDH1 as a guide. The quality of the map is variable, with the
expected gradient from regions that are in the well-packed interior at higher resolution, to
those on the periphery with greater solvent exposure at lower resolution. Comparison of the
structure of apo-IDH1 with that of ML309-bound IDH1 enables localization of ML309 in
the structure (Figures 2A and 2D). The location of the inhibitor in the cryo-EM structure
(Figure 2D) in a solvent-exposed region close to the 2-fold axis and near the catalytic site is
similar to that seen for many IDH1-inhibitor complexes that have been amenable to
crystallography (Deng et al., 2015; Okoye-Okafor et al., 2015; Wu et al., 2015; Zheng et al.,
2013).

Despite the modest resolution of the maps, the structures provide new insights into structural
aspects of IDH1 and its interaction with the inhibitor. Cryo-EM reconstructions carried out
without imposition of 2-fold symmetry resulted in maps at a resolution of ~4.5 Å, similar to
those obtained with the use of 2-fold symmetry (Figure S2B), indicating that the structure of
the IDH1 dimer in solution is symmetric at least at this resolution. This is a different result
than that obtained from crystal structures of IDH1, which are mostly asymmetric with
regions in the two protomers exhibiting different conformations (Xu et al., 2004; Yang et al.,
2010). In our structures, both polypeptide chains that form the IDH1 dimer appear to be
equivalent, suggesting that the apparent asymmetry is a likely consequence of crystal lattice
formation and is not an intrinsic property of the dimer, as confirmed by inspection of lattice
packing (Figure S3A). Further, comparison of the apo- and inhibitor-bound structures shows
that ML309 binding essentially drives a wedge between the two protomers, leading to an
outward movement of the peripheral domains (Figure 2E) that is clearly evident even when
comparing reconstructions obtained without imposition of symmetry (Movie S1). This
structural change includes displacement of a stretch of polypeptides spanning residues 270–
281. The density for bound NADPH and the surrounding residues in the pocket is adequate
for placement of the cofactor in the pocket (Figure S3B), but the low 3.8 Å resolution of the
maps precludes identification of the detailed interactions within the binding pocket.
Inspection of the asymmetrically reconstructed density map also enables the unambiguous
identification of additional density consistent with the binding of a single molecule of
ML309 at the dimer interface (Figure S3C), although its precise orientation cannot be
determined. Nevertheless, the location of the catalytic site between the NADPH binding site
and the site of bound ML309 potentially explains how ML309 binding can cause a profound
change in the catalytic activity of the enzyme. These results show that cryo-EM density
maps from small, <100 kDa dynamic proteins can not only help localize binding sites for
small molecule inhibitors, but also potentially predict changes in activity that can
complement information obtained from crystallographic studies.
Cryo-EM Analysis of Glutamate Dehydrogenase
The smaller size, lower symmetry, and conformational flexibility may all be contributing
factors that limit resolution of the IDH1 structures obtained using cryo-EM methods.

Intrinsic flexibility of proteins also poses a challenge for determining high-resolution
structures even with X-ray crystallography. In many cases, crystal contacts can freeze
specific protein conformations, enabling structure determination at resolutions of 2 Å or
better, but in other instances, local flexibility can be high enough to limit overall resolution.
The cancer target and hexameric enzyme GDH is a good example of this problem. GDH
displays closed and open conformations involving large movements of the nucleotide
binding domain (NBD), but even when trapped in closed or open conformations, the highest
resolutions reported so far from crystallographic studies and cryo-EM analyses of the open
conformation are ~2.7 Å (Smith et al., 2002) and ~3.3 Å (Borgnia et al., 2016), respectively.
We therefore used GDH to evaluate whether we could further optimize cryo-EM methods to
achieve resolutions of ~2 Å or better for the more ordered regions, despite the presence of
significant conformational flexibility in other areas of the protein.

Author Manuscript

Using cryo-EM projection images that were selected for reduced beam-induced drift, we
determined a cryo-EM structure for GDH in the open state using <22,000 molecular images
(Figures 3, S4, S5; Table 1; Movie S3). Irrespective of whether the maps were divided into
one, two, or more classes, the density maps displayed a clear difference between wellordered central regions covering the central half of the complex and “fuzzy” outer regions
for the rest, as illustrated by slices through projection images of the density map (Figures 3A
and 3B). Based on comparison of the extent of movement determined by classifying the data
to produce two discrete 3D structures, the range of motion in the peripheral NBD (Figure
3C; Movie S2) is seen to be small in comparison to the large domain movements observed
for transition from open to closed conformations (Figure 3C) (Borgnia et al., 2016).

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

The binding of GTP (an inhibitor) and ADP (an activator) to two allosteric sites in each
protomer modulates the transition between “closed” and “open” states of GDH. These
allosteric modulators tightly control GDH function in vivo. The two states we present in
Figures 3A and 3B are both in the “open” conformation with differences likely due to small
perturbations arising from the unhindered sampling of conformations due to the twisting
motions of the pivot helix in the absence of either ADP or GTP in solution. Despite the
presence of the flexible outer domains (Figures 3A and 3B), most of the interior of GDH can
nevertheless be visualized at resolutions better than 2 Å, well beyond the 2.7 Å resolution
obtained with X-ray crystallographic analysis, in which the flexible regions presumably limit
the order of the crystals obtained. In comparison to our earlier work with β-galactosidase
(Bartesaghi et al., 2015), in which we reported an average resolution of 2.2 Å, the density
map for GDH at 1.8 Å shows better-defined and more uniform density over most of the
ordered central core, spanning the subunit interface (Figure 3D), as well as clear density for
carbonyl bonds and several H-bonded water molecules and well-defined density for
extended Lys side chains (Figures S4B–S4E).

DISCUSSION
We have previously shown that it is possible to achieve atomic resolution information from
an inhibitor-bound protein complex such as the 465 kDa β-galactosidase (Banerjee et al.,
2016; Bartesaghi et al., 2015). The inhibitor-bound state of β-galactosidase is relatively
stable, with only a small gradient in temperature factor between the central and peripheral

regions, making it possible to achieve high resolution across the breadth of the protein.
However, many proteins can have flexible domains, as in the case of GDH, even when they
are expected to be in a single conformational state. While cryo-EM can be used to
effectively mask out flexible or disordered areas of a protein during steps in image
processing (Amunts et al., 2014; Bai et al., 2015a), it has remained an open question
whether the presence of a large fraction of the protein that is conformationally mobile may
preclude achieving atomic resolution for the more structured or stable regions of the
complex. The fact that we can visualize densities for each of the 20 amino acids in the GDH
cryo-EM map (Figure 4), without 3D masking during refinement, addresses this question
definitively while also enabling the crossing of the 2 Å resolution mark in single particle
cryo-EM. These cryo-EM densities are easily comparable to those obtained by X-ray
crystallography at a similar resolution (Figure S5).

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

The maps we have obtained for LDH display 2.8 Å resolution in the protein component and
densities for numerous water molecules (Figures S1D and S1E), but density for the bound
ligand is at lower resolution. One reason that the density for the bound ligand is less welldefined than that of the polypeptide may be because small molecule ligands bound to the
protein periphery are likely to sample far more conformations in aqueous solution than what
is possible in the context of a crystal lattice. Most solvents used for protein crystallization
invariably include additives such as PEG that dehydrate the crystal by removing excess
solvent and tightening the packing of protein molecules while reducing the size of the
solvent channels around the protein. As a result, these additives improve crystal order and
diffraction resolution, but at the same time, also affect ligand-protein interactions, as
dehydration reduces the number of water molecules in the binding pocket and therefore
minimizes the mobility of the ligand. Thus, cryo-EM studies in aqueous dispersions and Xray crystallographic studies in ordered 3D crystals provide potentially complementary
snapshots of ligand-protein interactions that are likely to occur in cellular environments.

Finding the correct orientation of each projection image is central for the success of the
single particle cryo-EM reconstruction process. The practical size limitation for highresolution structure determination is currently a question of considerable interest within the
cryo-EM field. Figure 5 provides a comparison of the relative sizes of complexes whose
structures have been studied at near-atomic resolution, including those reported in the
present study. Given the present state of detector and microscope technology, a figure of 150
kDa is thought to be a practical lower limit even for medium resolutions (Thompson et al.,
2016), even though theoretical arguments have been advanced for why much smaller sizes
should be accessible (Glaeser and Hall, 2011; Henderson, 1995). As instrumentation and
methods for data analysis have improved, our ability to overcome the handicaps of small
size, low symmetry, and high flexibility have likewise improved, allowing the reconstruction
of not just large, highly symmetric complexes such as icosahedral viruses, but now also of
smaller, lower symmetry complexes as well (Figure 5A). In this study, we have shown that
not only is it possible to determine the structure of a protein smaller than 150kDa to ~3 Å
resolution, it is also possible to determine the structure of a protein <100 kDa to near-atomic
(<4 Å) resolution, coupled with the visualization of the location of bound small-molecule
inhibitors in both cases. From an analysis of all of the parameters that influenced final map
quality, our conclusion is that selecting for specimens with thin ice, retaining only those

images that display the lowest beam-induced motion, and using a sufficiently small pixel
size and the improved XP sensor with higher DQE performance were the key factors that
enabled us to obtain high resolution with these smaller protein complexes.

As more examples of cryo-EM structures are reported, there are beginning to be noticeable
patterns in the differences between the visual appearance of cryo-EM density maps and
those obtained using X-ray crystallography. In visualizing cryo-EM density maps, different
regions of the map are typically explored by implementing B-factor sharpening specific to
the different segments of the map, but deposited maps and figures generally show density
maps sharpened with a single value for B factor for the entire protein, which poses a
challenge for capturing all of the information in a single view. Nevertheless, it is clear that in
all three of the protein complexes that we have analyzed, the outer regions are significantly
more flexible than the core of the complex (Figures 5B–5D). Since cryo-EM analyses report
on the structure of the proteins in solution, they can provide information on quaternary
structures complementary to that obtained from crystal structures, which may be influenced
by contacts within the crystal lattice. A common feature of the cryo-EM density maps we
have observed in structures of complexes of ligands with diverse proteins such as LDH,
IDH1, β-galactosidase, and p97 is that the density for bound ligands, especially in the
peripheral regions, is generally somewhat weaker and at lower resolution than that of
residues in the binding pocket. As noted earlier in the discussion, this is perhaps not
surprising given the presence of numerous single bonds around which rotations are possible,
coupled with poor steric and electrostatic fits between ligand and protein. Even in regions
where the density map of the polypeptide is poorly defined in small proteins such as IDH1,
crystallographic information can provide an invaluable framework to interpret the cryo-EM
structures, enabling identification of sites of inhibitor binding.

Size, symmetry, and intrinsic flexibility are all parameters that play a role in determining the
resolutions that can be achieved using cryo-EM. LDH and β-galactosidase are both tetramers
with the same symmetry (D2), but LDH is about a third of the size of β-galactosidase. The
lower resolutions currently achieved with LDH are most likely from the reduced accuracy of
alignment of projection images, and this comparison is thus a good way to assess effect of
size on resolution with presently available technology. The further drop in resolution
observed for IDH1 could be due to reduction in size, lower symmetry, and potentially
greater flexibility of the dimeric enzyme. Reconstruction of IDH1 without application of
symmetry resulted in only a slightly lower resolution (~4.5 Å), indicating that our results are
likely general in nature. It is possible that, for these small enzymes, improvements in
resolution could be obtained by the use of one or two bound Fab fragments (Wu et al.,
2012). Fab fragments not only increase the size of a complex, but also assist with orientation
assignment and can stabilize certain conformations of highly flexible complexes (Kim et al.,
2015; Lyumkis et al., 2013b). Since Fab fragments are ~50 kDa in size, an important
consequence of our results is that the presence of one or two bound Fab fragments may bring
almost any protein into a size range suitable for analysis by cryo-EM. Although we have not
yet achieved ~2 Å resolution with small complexes like IDH and LDH, it is likely that
further advances in detector technology will contribute toward achieving this goal. Ongoing
hardware developments such as phase plates (Danev and Baumeister, 2016), as well as
improvements in software for image alignment and reconstruction of heterogeneous

complexes, will also undoubtedly be necessary to advance cryo-EM frontiers to determine
high resolution structures of even smaller and more challenging complexes.

EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
Proteins and Grid Preparation
The chicken heart LDH (catalog #59747, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis) lyophilized sample was
suspended in 550 μl 1 × PBS buffer and centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 30 min. Thereafter, it
was subjected to gel filtration on a Superdex-200 size-exclusion chromatography column
connected to a ÄKTA FPLC apparatus (GE Healthcare Bio-Sciences, Piscataway) with an
elution buffer comprised of 1×PBS. The ligand GSK 2837808A (catalog #5189 Tocris
Bioscience) was dissolved in 100% DMSO and added to LDH (~1.5 mg/ml) to a final
inhibitor concentration of 75 μM and 0.5% DMSO.

Author Manuscript

Human IDH1 R132C mutant protein was purified following the published protocol (Davis et
al., 2014). ML309 was dissolved in 100% DMSO and added to IDH1 (2.8 mg/ml) to a final
inhibitor concentration of 50 μM and 0.5% DMSO.
GDH (catalog #G2626, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis) was dialyzed overnight against gelfiltration buffer (100 mM potassium phosphate [pH 6.8]) prior to purification by sizeexclusion chromatography (SEC) using a Superdex-200 size-exclusion chromatography
column connected to a ÄKTA FPLC apparatus (GE Healthcare Bio-Sciences, Piscataway).
Final protein concentration was ~3 mg/ml.

Author Manuscript

Prior to preparation of frozen-hydrated specimens, 3–4 μl of a freshly thawed aliquot of
purified proteins or inhibitor-protein complexes were deposited on Quantifoil R1.2/1/3 grids
and plunge frozen in liquid ethane cooled by liquid nitrogen using either a Leica plungefreeze device (for the LDH and IDH1 samples) or a Vitrobot (for the GDH samples). For
experiments with added inhibitor, the protein was pre-incubated for 30 min at room
temperature under the buffer conditions indicated above for each kind of protein complex.
Data Acquisition

Author Manuscript

The grids were imaged using a Titan Krios transmission electron microscope (FEI Company,
Hillsboro) aligned for parallel illumination and operated at 300 kV, with the specimen
maintained at liquid nitrogen temperatures. Images were recorded on a K2 Summit camera
(Gatan, Pleasanton) operated in super-resolution counting mode, placed at the end of a GIF
Quantum energy filter (Gatan), functioning in zero-energy-loss mode with a slit width of 20
eV as described previously (Bartesaghi et al., 2015). Images were typically collected with a
defocus range between −0.7–−3.0 μm. For LDH and IDH, a dose rate of ~5 e−/Å2/s (at the
specimen plane) was used with a total exposure time of 12 s. Intermediate frames were
recorded every 0.2 s giving an accumulated dose of ~60 e−/Å 2 and a total of 60 frames per
image. Pixel size was set to 0.495 Å. For GDH, a dose rate of ~2.6 e−/Å2/s was used and a
total exposure time of 15.2 s. Intermediate frames were recorded every 0.4 s giving an
accumulated dose of ~ 40 e−/Å2 and a total of 38 frames per image with a pixel size of 0.637
Å.

Movie frame alignment and contrast transfer function (CTF) estimation for each micrograph
were carried out as described previously (Bartesaghi et al., 2014). For the LDHB and IDH1
reconstructions, particles were picked from the original micrographs using a Gaussian disk
of 42 Å in radius as the search template. Particles were extracted using a binning factor of 8
and a box size of 96 pixels and subsequently subjected to 12 rounds of Frealign refinement
(Lyumkis et al., 2013a). The numbers of particle images used for each final reconstruction
are shown in Table 1. The subset of particles that contributed to the reconstruction in the last
iteration was re-extracted from the original micrographs using a binning factor of 4 and a
box size of 192 pixels followed by eight additional iterations of local refinement in Frealign.
In a similar way, particles were re-extracted and further refined two additional times using a
binning factor of 2 and a box size of 768 pixels, first using the full exposure and then using
only the first half of the exposure (frames 1–30), corresponding to ~30 e−/Å2. B-factor
sharpening was applied to the final maps for purposes of visualization (Table 1).

Images of GDH were processed in a way similar to that done for LDHB and IDH1, this time
using a Gaussian disk of 75 Å in radius as the search template for particle picking. The
selection of particles that contributed to the reconstruction at each iteration was in this case
done according to the bi-modal distribution of Frealign scores (Banerjee et al., 2016). Reextraction of selected particles from the original micrographs using progressively less
binning followed by local refinement was done as described above for the LDHB and IDH1
datasets. In addition, particles with a binning factor of 2 and a box size of 768 pixels were
re-extracted one final time using frames 3–9 and used to produce the final reconstruction by
applying the latest set of alignments (derived using the first half of the exposure) without
further refinement. A B factor of ~90 Å2 was applied to the final map for purposes of
visualization.
To estimate resolution, we used two approaches, both of which provided mutually consistent
results. In one approach, we used the strategy implemented in Frealign to carry out
refinement using only low-resolution information (to prevent over-fitting) and then measured
the value at which the FSC value drops to 0.143. The highest resolution we used for refining
particle orientations was 6 Å for the IDH1 datasets and 4 Å for the LDHB and GDH
datasets. As a complementary method, we computed the correlation between the
experimentally derived map and the refined model, and determined the value at which the
correlation drops to 0.5.
Atomic Model Refinement

Author Manuscript

The starting model used for the refinement of LDH was from the coordinates from the X-ray
structure 1I0Z. Changes were made to the initial model in order to incorporate the
differences between the human and chicken LDH amino acid sequences. The structure of the
apo LDH B was initially refined by rigid-body refinement followed by real-space refinement
using the program Phenix (Adams et al., 2010). Manual adjustments were made using the
program COOT (Emsley et al., 2010). Solvent molecules were added manually followed by
a round of real-space refinement.

The starting model used for the refinement of NADPH-bound IDH1 was from the
coordinates from the structure 3MAP. Prior to refinement, the residue Arg132 was mutated to
a cysteine and the isocitrate molecule was removed from the model. The structure of the
NADPH-bound IDH1 was initially refined by rigid-body refinement followed by real-space
refinement using the program Phenix. Manual adjustments were made by refinement in
COOT following another round of real-space refinement. For the ML-309-bound structure,
the starting model was the NADPH-bound IDH1 obtained using the cryo-EM data. The
refinement protocol was identical to the one used previously.

Author Manuscript

The PDB coordinates 3JCZ served as a starting point for the refinement of apo-GDH.
Initially, rigid-body fitting followed by real-space refinement using the program Phenix was
used to refine the model. Manual adjustments were made in COOT. Solvent molecules were
added automatically using stringent thresholds followed by manual inspection. Thereafter,
the model was refined again using real-space refinement as implemented in Phenix.
