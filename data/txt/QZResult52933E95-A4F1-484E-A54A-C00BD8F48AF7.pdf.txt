Abstract
Incidence of kidney cancer is on the rise, and a better understanding of molecular mechanisms
involved in the cancer invasion and metastasis is required for the development of curative
therapeutics. In this study, we report that the proinflammatory cytokine prostaglandin E2 (PGE2)
induces the malignant SN12C, but not benign HK2 kidney cell invasion. The PGE2 increases
SN12C cell invasion through a signal pathway that encompasses EP2 and EP4, Akt, small GTPase
RalA and Ral GTP inactivator RGC2. The results support the idea that targeted interference of
EP2/EP4 signal to RalA GTP may provide benefit to patients diagnosed with advanced kidney
cancer.

Introduction

Author Manuscript

Kidney cancer is the most lethal genitourinary cancer and renal cell carcinoma (RCC), the
most common type of kidney cancer, accounts for about 3% of all cancer diagnoses in the
USA each year (1). In 2011, an estimated 60,920 Americans were diagnosed with kidney
and renal pelvis cancer and 13,120 died from the disease (1). Five major RCC subtypes are
recognized based on histopathologic appearance, including clear cell, papillary,
chromophobe, oncocytoma and collecting-duct (2). Often, RCC is resistant to conventional
cytotoxic and radiation therapies, although targeted therapies are effective in some cases (3,

4). RCCs are usually detected locally, although about one third of patients present with
disseminated cancer (5) that eventually leads to patient mortality (6). Hence, the early
detection and interference with the cancer metastasis are crucial factors to improve patient
overall and progression-free survival.

Emerging evidence supports a role for inflammation in tumorigenesis (7, 8), and the
proinflammatory cytokine prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) impacts both the cancer cells and
reactive stroma in the tumor microenvironment (9). Prostaglandins are endogenously
produced by cytosolic phospholipase A2-mediated release of arachidonic acid from
phospholipids that, in turn, is metabolized by cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes (10). Of
significance, expression of COX2 and PGE2 is substantially increased in diseased tissues of
patients diagnosed with cancer (11–13), and PGE2 is the predominant prostaglandin in the
kidney. Four cognate receptors named EP1, EP2, EP3 and EP4 (10, 14) transduce PGE2’s
effects on target cells. These receptors belong to the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR)
family and, in most cells, activated EP1 couples to Gq and induces the activation of protein
kinase C consequent to intracellular Ca+2 mobilization. EP3 couples to Gi and inhibits
accumulation of adenosine 3′,5′-cyclic monophosphate (cAMP), whereas EP2 and EP4
couple to Gs and promote the synthesis of cAMP (14). In addition, Gβγ subunits transduce
PGE2-initiated signals leading, for example, to transactivation of epidermal growth factor
receptor (EGFR) and its downstream signaling networks (15). Hence, the PGE2-EP pairs
transduce multiple and specific signals in target cells.

Author Manuscript

Available evidence demonstrates a role for PGE2 and its receptors in cancer cell growth and
invasion. For instance, in the tumor milieu PGE2 may act directly upon the epithelial cancer
cells to influence their growth rate and invasion (16, 17), or on hematopoietic (9) and
endothelial (18, 19) cells in the stroma to regulate local immune suppression and
angiogenesis, respectively. In this study, we investigated contribution of PGE2 and its
cognate receptors to kidney cancer cell invasion. The results show that PGE2 promotes the
cancer, but not benign kidney cell invasion of a Matrigel matrix through small GTPase RalA
protein. Stimulation with PGE2 leads to Akt-mediated and phosphorylation-dependent
inactivation of the Ral GTPase activating protein (GAP) complex 2 (RGC2), a Ral
inactivator (20). Use of complementary pharmacologic ligand agonist and antagonist and
biologic small interfering RNA (siRNA) reagents implicates EP2, EP4, Akt, RGC2 and
RalA in the PGE2-induced kidney cancer cell invasion. Together, these studies identify a
new PGE2 → EP2/EP4 → Akt → RGC2 → RalA signal transduction cascade that promotes
the kidney cancer cell invasion, and provide rationale for the targeting of components of this
pathway to limit advanced kidney cancer morbidity and mortality.

Results
PGE2 induces invasion of SN12C renal cancer cells
Stimulation of non-kidney cancer cells with PGE2 induces the cell proliferation, survival,
and migration (11). We tested whether activation of endogenous EPs with PGE2 also
regulates the invasion of malignant SN12C, or benign and immortalized HK2 human kidney
cells. Treatment with PGE2 enhanced the invasion of SN12C cells of a Matrigel matrix as
detected with the transwell invasion assay (Fig. 1A, 1B). Distinctly, the similar treatment of

benign HK2 cells with PGE2 not only failed to increase, but in fact decreased the cell
invasion (Fig. 1A, 1B). These effects of PGE2 on the invasion of both SN12C and HK2 cells
were dose-dependent suggesting a receptor-mediated response. The treatment with EGF
promoted invasion of both SN12C and HK2 cells (Fig. 1A). To exclude the possibility that
PGE2 impacts the kidney cell invasion by affecting rate of cell proliferation (21), we stained
cells with trypan blue and counted viable, trypan blue-excluding cells using a
hemocytometer under light microscopy. Results shown in Figure 1C demonstrate the lack of
PGE2 effect on the growth rate of SN12C or HK2 cells (within the same time frame used to
examine the cell invasion), prompting the conclusion that PGE2 specifically stimulates
invasiveness of the renal cancer SN12C cells.
RalA activation correlates with invasion of SN12C cells

Author Manuscript

PGE2 promotes the SN12C cancer cell invasion albeit the mechanisms involved remain
incomplete. Expression levels of attachment proteins that regulate cell migration and
invasion vary among RCC cell lines (22), suggesting existence of cell type-specific invasive
mechanisms. Recently, we reported that PGE2-promoted RCC7 cell invasion of collagen is
mediated through EP4 and small GTPase Rap proteins (23).

Author Manuscript

Emerging evidence suggests a role for Ras-like small GTPase Ral (RalA and RalB) proteins
in certain types of cancer cell invasion and metastasis (24–26). Activated Ral is bound to
GTP and we determined the effect of PGE2 stimulation on Ral•GTP levels with a GST pull
down assay using the Ral-binding domain (RBD) of Ral-binding protein 1 (RalBP1). In
SN12C cells, RalA was activated by PGE2 in a dose-dependent manner and reached
maximal effects (35% of total RalA) at a concentration of 10 nM (Fig. 2A, 2B). On the other
hand, RalB was not appreciably activated in these cells following a similar treatment with
PGE2 (Fig. 2A, 2B). EGF stimulation promoted activation of RalA (59.8%) as well as RalB
(22.1%) in the SN12C cells (Fig. 2A, 2B). The activation pattern of RalA (Fig. 2A)
correlates with the PGE2-induced invasion of SN12C cells (Fig. 1A), suggesting
involvement of RalA GTP in the PGE2-induced kidney cancer cell invasion.

Author Manuscript

In benign HK2 kidney cells, PGE2 exerted a distinct effect on the Ral activation response
(Fig. 2C, 2D). Whereas PGE2 induced the modest RalA activation (only 10% of total RalA),
it prompted a substantial increase in the RalB•GTP levels (about 40% of total RalB). EGF
treatment exhibited a similar response; EGF promoted the modest RalA (10.8%) but robust
RalB (43.4%) activation (Fig. 2C, 2D). Under steady-state conditions the fraction of
RalA•GTP in HK2 cells (about 3% of total RalA) was substantially less than that in the
SN12C cells (about 20% of total RalA), whereas the fraction of RalB•GTP was similar in
both cell types (about 20% of total RalB). Collectively, these results establish a correlation
between PGE2-induced SN12C cell invasion (Fig. 1A) and RalA activation (Fig. 2B), and
an inverse relationship between RalB•GTP levels (Fig. 2D) and inhibition of HK2 cell
invasion (Fig. 1A). Whereas EGF and PGE2 induce the similar RalA and RalB activation in
SN12C cells (Fig. 2), only EGF could promote the HK2 cell invasion (Fig. 1), suggesting
involvement of distinct mechanisms of EGF- and PGE2-mediated cell invasion. Although
RalA and RalB are highly homologous and are known to share downstream effectors (27),

our results suggest distinct and non-redundant functions for active RalA and RalB in the
kidney cancer cell invasion.
RalA is required for SN12C cell invasion
To provide direct evidence for involvement of RalA in the PGE2-induced cell invasion, we
knocked down expression of endogenous RalA with siRNA in SN12C (Fig. 3A) and HK2
(Fig. 3B) cells. The SN12C cells with knocked down expression of RalA failed to invade
following stimulation with PGE2 (Fig. 3C). On the other hand, the knockdown of RalB (Fig.
3D) or RalA (Fig. S1A) in HK2 cells did not impact the PGE2-induced decrease in the cell
invasion. These results lead to the conclusion that RalA mediates the PGE2-regulated
SN12C, but not HK2 cell invasion.
PGE2 activates RalA through EP2 and EP4

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

PGE2 exerts its effects on target cells through at least four cognate receptors named EP1,
EP2, EP3 and EP4. To begin to determine identity of EP(s) responsible for the PGE2induced RalA activation, SN12C cells were treated with PGE2 (non-selective EP agonist),
sulprostone (selective EP1/EP3 agonist), butaprost (selective EP2 agonist), or PGE1-OH
(selective EP4 agonist) alone, or in combination with AH6809 (selective EP1/EP2/EP3
antagonist) or AH23848 (selective EP4 antagonist). Treatment with PGE2 induced a
significant increase in the levels of GTP-bound RalA, which was marginally attenuated
when the cells were pre-treated with either AH23848 or AH6809, but was completely
inhibited when cells were pre-treated with both antagonists (Fig. 4A, 4B). The treatment
with sulprostone had no effect on the RalA•GTP levels (Fig. S1B, S1C), excluding the
possible involvement of EP1 or EP3. Consistent with the conclusion that EP2 and EP4
mediate the RalA•GTP expression, treatment with butaprost or PGE1-OH induced the
AH6809- and AH23848-senstive, respectively, RalA activation (Fig. 4A, 4B).

Author Manuscript

To provide evidence that EP2 and EP4 play a role not only in RalA•GTP expression but also
in the actual SN12C cell invasion, cells were treated with complementary EP-specific ligand
agonists and antagonists. Results show that whereas the treatment with PGE2, PGE1-OH, or
butaprost increased the SN12C cell invasion, the similar treatment with sulprostone did not
(Fig. 4C), implying a role for EP2 and EP4, but not EP1 or EP3 in the cell invasion. The
butaprost-mediated SN12C cell invasion was attenuated by AH6809, and invasion
stimulated by PGE1-OH was specifically inhibited by AH23848. Either antagonist alone
could only partially inhibit the PGE2-stimulated cell invasion, while the combination of both
antagonists abolished the effect of PGE2 on the cell invasion (Fig. 4C). Together, these
results exclude a role for EP1 or EP3, and confirm requirement of EP2 and EP4 in the
PGE2-induced SN12C cell invasion, mirroring EP2 and EP4 roles in the PGE2-regulated
RalA activation.
G proteins, including Ral, cycle between inactive, GDP-bound state, and active, GTP-bound
state. Ral-specific guanine exchange factors (GEFs) facilitate the exchange of GDP for GTP,
and the hydrolysis of GTP to GDP is mediated by specific Ral GTPase activating proteins
(GAPs). Hence, increased levels of RalA•GTP may occur as a result of RalGEF activation
or RalGAP inactivation. A recent report showed that the stimulation of cells (that do not

express activating mutation of Ras) with insulin leads to increased levels of Ral•GTP due to
inactivation of the RalGAP RGC2 as a result of RGC2 phosphorylation by Akt (20). SN12C
cells do not appear to express activated Ras (28) and we tested whether PGE2 promotes the
RalA•GTP as a result of RGC2 inactivation consequent to phosphorylation by Akt. Data
presented in Figure 4A and 4B demonstrate the PGE2-induced RalA•GTP coincides with the
PGE2-induced Akt and RGC2 phosphorylation. Together, these results suggest that PGE2
may increase the SN12C cell invasion via an EP2/EP4 → Akt → RGC2 → RalA•GTP
signaling cascade.
PGE2 induces the Akt-mediated RGC2 phosphorylation

Author Manuscript

To provide evidence for a direct role of Akt in the PGE2-induced RalA•GTP consequent to
RGC2 phosphorylation, SN12C cells were treated with PGE2 in the presence or absence of
the phosphatidylinositol 3-OH kinase (PI3K) inhibitor LY294002. Treatment with PGE2
induced the time-dependent increase in RalA•GTP levels, and Akt and RGC2
phosphorylation, reaching maximal effects after 5 min of stimulation (Fig. 5A, 5B).
Remarkably, the treatment with PGE2 promoted the significant increase in Akt and RGC2
phosphorylation levels after 2 min of stimulation, but increased the RalA•GTP levels only
after 5 min of stimulation, establishing Akt and RGC2 phosphorylation precedes the
RalA•GTP expression. Pre-treatment of cells with LY294002 abrogated the PGE2-induced
Akt and RGC2 phosphorylation and subsequent RalA•GTP accumulation (Fig. 5A, 5B).
Significantly, the treatment with LY294002 also abrogated the PGE2-induced SN12C cell
invasion (Fig. 5C). Confirmatory experiments using knockdown of endogenous Akt genes
(Fig. 5D) evidenced a similar decrease in the PGE2-induced SN12C cell invasion (Fig. 5E),
demonstrating a crucial role for activated Akt in the PGE2-induced kidney cancer cell
invasion.

Author Manuscript

RGC2 is required for RalA activation and SN12C cell invasion
To investigate if RGC2 forms a critical link between PGE2-induced Akt phosphorylation
and RalA activation, we knocked down expression of endogenous RGC2 gene with siRNA.
In the RalA activity assay, the knockdown of RGC2 expression increased basal RalA•GTP
levels by about 60%, similar to the magnitude achieved with PGE2 stimulation (Fig. 6A,
6B). The decrease in RGC2 expression showed no impact on the basal or PGE2-induced Akt
phosphorylation levels (Fig. 6A, 6B). For cell invasion, the knockdown of RGC2 expression
increased basal SN12C cell invasion by about 70%, in a manner similar to the PGE2induced effect (Fig. 6C). Together, these results suggest that PGE2 induces the SN12C cell
invasion via a mechanism that involves RGC2.

Discussion
Cancer-related deaths are due, in large part, to the cancer cell dissemination to distal organs.
In the case of kidney cancer, the prognosis of patients diagnosed with metastatic disease and
treated with targeted therapies remains modest with a median of about 40 months (3, 29,
30). Surgical resection of the malignant tissue may be curative for localized low-grade
cancer, but management options for patients suffering from locally advanced or metastatic
disease are not curative (3), providing rationale to identify mechanisms involved in the

cancer initiation and metastasis as a prerequisite for discovering effective therapeutics. The
principal finding of this study is that the proinflammatory cytokine PGE2 promotes
malignant, but not benign kidney cell invasion by activating cognate receptors EP2 and EP4
that, in turn, transduce signals to activate small GTPase RalA. The signaling cascade
connecting stimulated EP2 and EP4 to RalA includes PI3K/Akt and the RalA inactivator
RGC2. Activated Akt phosphorylates RGC2 leading to the blunting of RGC2’s function to
hydrolyze enzymatically active RalA•GTP to inactive RalA•GDP.

A causative link between persistent inflammation and cancer is becoming increasingly clear
(7, 8). Indeed, tumor growth and progression is subject to regulation not only by the
malignant cancer cells themselves, but also by the surrounding tumor microenvironment that
encompasses activated fibroblasts, enhanced angiogenesis and infiltrating inflammatory
cells. Tumor cells acquire the ability to generate local immune suppression (through the
secretion of factors) that is commonly associated with cancer inflammation. A frequent
occurrence in cancer is upregulated expression of COX2 that produces proinflammatory
mediators, including PGE2 (11). Specifically, expression levels of COX2 and PGE2 are
increased in kidney cancer and indicate poor prognosis and reduced survival time. In this
study, we showed that PGE2 impacts the malignant SN12C, but not benign HK2 human
kidney cells, justifying the opportunity to target (specific) PGE2 signal networks for the
treatment of patients with kidney cancer.

Author Manuscript

PGE2 exerts its effects on target cells by activating four cognate receptors and our results
implicate EP2 and EP4 in the PGE2-induced RalA activation and SN12C cell invasion. Both
EP2 and EP4 couple to Gs proteins (10, 14), and the best studied Gαs effectors are adenylyl
cyclases that produce cAMP leading to the activation of protein kinase A. Stimulation of
SN12C cells with PGE2 led to the activation of PKA as evidenced by the phosphorylation of
VASP protein (Fig. S2), a PKA substrate (31). However, the inhibition of PKA activity with
H89 (32) had no effect on the PGE2-induced RalA•GTP expression, or Akt and RGC2
phosphorylation (Fig. S2), excluding a possible role for PKA in the PGE2-regulated SN12C
cell invasion.

Author Manuscript

A preponderance of evidence demonstrates a role for activated Akt in cancer cell migration
and invasion (33). Recently, it was reported that activated Akt phosphorylates the RalGAP
RGC2 leading to its inactivation (20) and consequent increased levels of Ral•GTP. In nonkidney cells, EPs transduce Akt activating signals through Gβγ subunits that may directly
activate PI3Kγ (16), or indirectly activate PI3Kα/β through, for example, transactivation of
EGFR (15, 34). Our results show that stimulation of SN12C kidney cancer cells with PGE2
promotes the EP2- and EP4-mediated Akt activation and RGC2 phosphorylation. Hence,
PGE2 may regulate Ral•GTP levels through Akt-dependent inactivation of its GTPase
activating protein RGC2. Inhibition of PI3K activation or knockdown of endogenous Akt
expression should, at least in theory, mask the RGC2 phosphorylation and inactivation
thereby leading to increased Ral•GDP levels. Consistent with this conclusion, our results
show that the inhibition of Akt activation attenuates the SN12C cell invasion.
Like other GTPases, Ral signaling is controlled by activators in the form of RalGEFs and
inactivators in the form of RalGAPs. In cancer cells that express Ras activating mutations,

Ral is largely activated through Ras effectors RalGEFs (24). However, less information is
available regarding Ral activation in cancer cells that do not express active Ras. Our results
show that stimulation of endogenous EPs leads to the Ral activation through inactivation of
its RalGAP RGC2. In the case of other small GTPases that are involved in cell
transformation or invasion, inactivation or downregulation of their specific GAPs has been
suggested to promote tumorigenesis. For example, inactivation mutation of Rap1GAP
contributes to several types of malignancies (35). It remains to be determined whether
decreased expression and/or inactivation mutations of RGC2 are causative of kidney cancer
cell invasion.

Author Manuscript

An interesting result in our studies is the finding that PGE2 promotes invasion of malignant
SN12C, but not benign HK2 cells. Reasons for the observed discriminate effects of PGE2 on
these two human kidney cell lines remains unclear. Using real-time PCR analysis, we
observed that while both cell lines expressed similar levels of EP1 and EP3 genes, SN12C
cells expressed more EP4 but less EP2 genes, in comparison to the HK2 cells (Fig. S3).
Hence, it is possible that the ratio of EP4/EP2 may be a determinant in the cell’s invasive
response to PGE2. In addition, we also observed that RalA and RalB expression levels and
activation states are distinct among the two cell lines. We found that RalB expression is
higher in the benign HK2 than in the cancerous SN12C kidney cells (data not shown). Under
basal conditions, RalB activity is about 20% of total RalB in both cell lines and, therefore,
the steady-state RalB•GTP levels are higher in the HK2, compared to SN12C cells. Also,
total RalA and steady-state RalA GTP levels are higher in the SN12C (20%) than HK2
(<5%) cells. Our results, therefore, suggest that RalA activity is dominant in the SN12C
cells and RalB activity is dominant in the HK2 cells, consistent with the role of RalA in
prostate cancer cell metastasis (25) but in contrast to its role in pancreatic cancer cells that
express activating Ras mutations (24) where RalB exerts the chief effect on the cancer cell
metastasis. Altogether, these observations lend support to the idea that distinct cancer types
with underlying specific genetic alterations may employ specific Ral isoforms to support
their invasion and metastasis.

Author Manuscript

In summary, we have uncovered a PGE2-controlled signaling pathway that regulates the
kidney cancer cell invasion. The involved signal pathway contains drug-targeting
intermediates, including Akt, RGC2 and RalA that may be used to benefit patients with
advanced disease. Also, EP2 and EP4 signals may be interdicted with specific ligand
antagonists as GPCRs have proven to be viable drug targets (36). Hence, the combined
targeted inhibition of EP2 and EP4 activation and rescued activation of RGC2 may improve
prognosis of patients diagnosed with advanced kidney cancer.

Ral activation assay

Author Manuscript

Ral activation was determined using an established pull-down method based on the specific
binding of a GST-RalBP1-RBD fusion protein to the active, GTP-bound form of Ral.
Briefly, whole cell lysates were centrifuged at 13,000 × rpm for 12 min at 4°C and the
supernatant was removed and assayed for protein concentration. The GST-tagged RalBP1RBD protein was expressed in BL21 cells, purified using glutathione sepharose 4B beads.
Equal amount of GST-RalBP1-RBD was added to equal amount of cell extracts. Mixtures
were incubated for 1 hr at 4°C, washed twice with cell lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH
7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 15% (v/v) glycerol, 1% (v/v) NP40, and protease
inhibitor cocktail (Sigma)), once with lysis buffer containing 500 mM NaCl and once again
with lysis buffer, and boiled in Laemmli sample buffer. The precipitated proteins were
analyzed by Western blotting. For quantitative analyses, band intensities were digitized with
a flatbed scanner, quantified with ImageJ software (NCBI), and levels of activated Ral
proteins are presented as the ratio of Ral•GTP signal to the corresponding total Ral signal.

Appropriately treated cells were washed with PBS and lysed in lysis buffer. The samples
were denatured in Laemmli sample buffer, resolved on 10% or 15% SDS-polyacrylamide
gels, transferred to PVDF membranes (Millipore), and immunoblotted with the indicated
antibody in blocking buffer (4% BSA-PBST). The antibodies were used at the following
dilutions: RalA, 1:2,000; RalB, 1:2,000; Actin, 1:100,000; Akt, 1:2,000; phospho-Ser473Akt, 1:1,000; RGC2, 1:1,000; phospho-Ser486-RGC2, 1:1,000; and phospho-Thr715-RGC2,

West Pico chemiluminescence (Pierce) reagents.
Invasion assay
Cell invasion assays were done using 8-μm pore transwell chambers coated with Matrigel
according to the manufacturer instructions (BD Bioscience). Briefly, SN12C or HK2 cell
monolayers at 60–80% confluency were starved for 36 hr, detached using HyQtase
(Hyclone), washed and resuspended in starvation medium, and added to the transwell
chambers (5 × 104 cells/well). Starvation medium containing the indicated reagent was

Fig. 1. PGE2 promotes SN12C renal cancer cell invasion

Author Manuscript

(A) Effect of PGE2 on the invasion of malignant SN12C and benign HK2 kidney cells.
Equal number of SN12C and HK2 cells were starved overnight and allowed to invade
Matrigel-coated transwell filters in the presence, or absence, of PGE2 (nM) or EGF (20 nM)
for 18 hr. Cells that invaded the matrix and migrated to the bottom side of the filter were
stained with Diff-Quik. Cells in four randomly-selected fields were counted using a phasecontrast microscope and are presented as percent change in comparison to control nottreated (NT) samples. Each point represents the mean ± S.E.M. of values obtained from
three independent experiments performed in duplicate, and * P < 0.05 versus corresponding
not-treated samples. (B) Representative microscopic images of migrated cells. (C) Effect of
PGE2 on the kidney cell proliferation. Cells were stimulated, or not, with PGE2 (50 nM) for
24 hr at 37°C, detached and incubated with 0.1% trypan blue stain solution. Cells excluding
the dye were counted under light microscopy with a hemocytometer. Each point represents
the mean ± S.E.M. of values obtained from three independent experiments.

(A) PGE2 increases the RalA•GTP but not RalB•GTP expression levels in cancer SN12C
cells. SN12C cells were treated, or not, for 5 min with the indicated concentration of PGE2
(in nM) or EGF (20 ng/ml). Cell lysates were used in pull-down assays using GST-RalBP1RBD fusion protein conjugated to glutathione agarose beads. Protein complexes on beads
were washed four times (twice in lysis buffer, once in lysis buffer containing 500 mM NaCl,
and once more in lysis buffer). Levels of RalA•GTP, RalB•GTP, and total RalA, RalB and
Actin proteins were determined using anti-RalA, anti-RalB, and anti-Actin antibodies.
Shown are representative blots from a single experiment. (B) Quantitative analysis of
RalA•GTP and RalB•GTP levels in SN12C cells. (C) Effect of PGE2 treatment on
RalA•GTP and RalB•GTP expression in benign HK2 cells. Levels of Ral•GTP proteins were
determined exactly as described under A. (D) Quantitative analysis of RalA•GTP and
RalB•GTP levels in HK2 cells. For results shown in panels B and D, data are presented as a
percent of Ral•GTP over total Ral (in the whole cell lysate) and each point represents the
mean ± S.E.M. of values obtained from at least three independent experiments. * P < 0.05
versus corresponding control not-treated (NT) samples.

Fig. 3. Effect of RalA knockdown on SN12C cell invasion

Knockdown of endogenous RalA in SN12C (A) and HK2 (B) cells. Cells were transiently
transfected with control siRNA (siCon), RalA or RalB siRNA for 24 hr followed by
starvation for another 24 hr. Expression of RalA and Actin were determined by Western
blot, and the levels of detected Actin served as a control for total protein loading.
Requirement of RalA in the PGE2-induced SN12C (C) and HK2 (D) cell invasion. Cells
transfected with control siRNA (siCon), RalA or RalB siRNA were analyzed for PGE2 (50
nM) effect on cell invasion. Data are presented as percent change in comparison to nottreated (NT) samples and each point represents the mean ± S.E.M. of values obtained from
three independent experiments. * P < 0.05 versus corresponding not-treated (NT) samples.

(A) Effect of EP ligand agonists and antagonists on RalA•GTP expression, RGC2
phosphorylation, and Akt phosphorylation. Cells were pre-treated with AH6809 or
AH23848 for 30 min prior to stimulation with PGE2 (50 nM), butaprost (1 μM), or PGE1OH (10 nM) for additional 5 min. RalA•GTP levels were determined with pull down assay.
SN12C cell lysates were used to determine phosphorylation content of RGC2 (on Ser 486
and Thr 715 residues) and Akt (on Ser 473) by Western blot. Expression of total Akt is
presented to demonstrate the equal protein loading among the different samples. (B)
Quantitation of RalA•GTP, phospho-Akt and phospho-Ser486-RGC2. Band intensities were
quantified and are presented as percent change in RalA•GTP, phospho-Akt, or phosphoRGC2 (Ser486) bands intensities, compared to corresponding not-treated samples that are
arbitrarily assigned 100%. Numbers for the x-axes correspond to sample designation in A.
(C) Effect of EP ligand agonists and antagonists on SN12C cell invasion. Cells were treated
as in A and analyzed for invasion. Values for y-axis are percent change in comparison to
not-treated (NT) samples. For panels B and C, each point represents the mean ± S.E.M. of
values obtained from three independent experiments. * P < 0.05 versus corresponding
