ABSTRACT
Epithelial membrane protein-3 (EMP3), a typical member of the epithelial membrane
protein (EMP) family, is epigenetically silenced in some cancer types, and has been
proposed to be a tumor suppressor gene. However, its effects on tumor suppression are
controversial and its roles in development and malignancy of hepatocellular carcinoma
(HCC) remain unclear. In the present study, we found that EMP3 was highly expressed
in the tumorous tissues comparing to the matched normal tissues, and negatively
correlated with differentiated degree of HCC patients. Knockdown of EMP3 significantly
reduced cell proliferation, arrested cell cycle at G1 phase, and inhibited the motility and
invasiveness in accordance with the decreased expression and activity of urokinase
plasminogen activator (uPA) and matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP-9) in HCC cells. The
in vivo tumor growth of HCC was effectively suppressed by knockdown of EMP3 in a
xenograft mouse model. The EMP3 knockdown-reduced cell proliferation and invasion
were attenuated by inhibition of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) or knockdown of
Akt, and rescued by overexpression of Akt in HCC cells. Clinical positive correlations of
EMP3 with p85 regulatory subunit of PI3K, p-Akt, uPA, as well as MMP-9 were observed
in the tissue sections from HCC patients. Here, we elucidated the tumor progressive
effects of EMP3 through PI3K/Akt pathway and uPA/MMP-9 cascade in HCC cells. The
findings provided a new insight into EMP3, which might be a potential molecular target
for diagnosis and treatment of HCC.

to the asymptomatic lesion in an early stage of HCC.
Only around 30% of patients are eligible for curative
therapies, such as surgery or ablation. Treatment options
of the other intermediate/advanced metastasized HCC
are limited as transcatheter arterial chemoembolization
(TACE), radioembolization, and systemic therapy, such as
chemotherapy and sorafenib, a multikinase inhibitor [3].
However, clinical outcomes of these unresectable HCC
patients are still unfavorable. Therefore, understanding
the molecular mechanisms of malignancy of HCC will
provide novel molecular target for a potential therapeutic
strategy.
In addition to late diagnosis of HCC patients, cancer
metastasis is one of the critical causes of poor clinical
outcome or mortality [4]. The process of metastatic
spread of cancers is complicated including cell adhesion,
migration, invasion, and proteolytic degradation of
extracellular matrix (ECM) [5]. Urokinase plasminogen
activator (uPA) [6] and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs)
[7] are involved in degradation of ECM, which is a critical
step in the metastatic process. The uPA network consists
of uPA, uPA receptor (uPAR), plasminogen, plasmin, and
the negative regulators, plasminogen activator inhibitors
(PAIs), PAI-1 and PAI-2 [6]. uPA activates a serine
proteinase plasmin to degrade the components of ECM
by proteolytic cleavage of inactive zymogen plasminogen,
leading to promotion of invasion of cancer cells. Increase
of uPA cascade [8] and activity of MMPs [9] have been
demonstrated in invasion and metastasis of HCC. Thus,
we aimed to investigate the upstream signaling of uPA and
MMPs in malignancy of HCC in the current study.
Human epithelial membrane protein-3 (EMP3)
located on chromosome 19q13.3 was first identified by
homology screening of databases [10, 11]. EMP3 encodes
a 163 amino-acid protein containing 4 transmembrane
domains, and belongs to the peripheral myelin protein
22-kDa (PMP22) gene family of small hydrophobic
membrane glycoproteins due to the high amino acid
sequence homology [12]. The expression of EMP-3
is found in most tissues including liver, and higher in
peripheral blood leukocytes, ovary, intestine and various
embryonic tissues [11]. The functions of EMP3 are still
unclear and controversial. EMP3 has been proposed
to be a tumor suppressor gene, which is silenced by
hypermethylation on its promoter region in glioma
[13–16], neuroblastoma [13, 17], and non-small cell
lung cancer [18]. Its promoter methylation concomitant
with the loss of heterozygosity of chromosome 19q has
been observed in the grade II oligodendroglioma patients
at a higher risk of relapse and disease progression-free
interval [19]. The potential tumor suppressive function
of EMP3 has also been reported to be repressed in
esophageal squamous cell carcinoma cell lines [20]. In
contrast, other reports do not support EMP3 as a candidate
of tumor suppressor gene and suggest its function in
tumor aggressiveness. Overexpression of EMP3 is found
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

in oligodendroglial tumors [21], and primary breast
carcinomas without altering DNA methylation [22].
Recently, EMP3 has been demonstrated to promote cell
proliferation and migration and its co-expression with
ErbB2 is unfavorable for progression-free and metastasisfree survival in patients with upper urinary tract urothelial
carcinoma [23].
Although EMP3 transcripts can be detected in
liver, the roles of EMP3 in HCC development and
malignancy remain unknown so far. In the present study,
we demonstrated the potential roles of EMP3 in tumor
aggressiveness of HCC cells, and found that EMP3 was
highly expressed in the tumorous tissues comparing to
non-tumorous tissues of HCC patients. Knockdown of
EMP3 reduced cell proliferation, arrested cell cycle at
G1 phase, and inhibited the abilities of cell migration and
invasion accompanied with a decrease of the expression
and activity of MMP-9 and uPA in HCC cells. The
suppression of cell proliferation and malignancy caused by
silencing EMP3 of HCC cells was mediated with downregulation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt
pathway. The study provided a new insight into EMP3,
suggesting that EMP3 enhances malignancy of HCC cells,
and it might be a potential molecular target for diagnosis
and treatment of HCC patients.

RESULTS
EMP3 is highly expressed in tissue sections from
HCC patients and in HCC cell lines
To clarify the correlation between EMP3 and
development of human HCC, We examined the expression
of EMP3 protein by Western blot in HCC tissues and
matched non-tumorous tissues. Of 16 HCC tumors, 13
expressed higher levels of EMP3 than non-tumorous
tissues (Figure 1A). Immunohistochemical staining was
conducted on a tissue microarray containing samples from
74 patients of HCC tissues and 20 normal hepatic tissues.
Higher levels of EMP3 in HCC tissues were evidenced
compared with normal hepatic tissues (Figure 1B).
Consistently, the expression of EMP3 was significantly
negatively correlated with degree of differentiation in HCC
patients (p < 0.031). In contrast, there was no significant
correlation between EMP3 expressions in age, sex, and
tumor stage of HCC tissues (Table 1). Furthermore,
we confirmed expression of EMP3 in 5  human HCC
cells (HA22T/VGH, SK-Hep-1, Huh-7, PLC/PRF/5
and HepG2) and one normal hepatic cell (THLE-2), the
expression levels of EMP3 in poor differentiated HCC
cell lines, HA22T/VGH and SK-Hep-1, were much
higher than that in moderate differentiated PLC/PRF/5
and Huh-7 and well differentiated HepG2 cell lines, and
lowest in THLE-2 normal hepatic cell line, as determined
by immunoblotting (Figure 1C) and immunofluorescence

conversely associated with differentiation of HCC,
suggesting its potential roles in malignancy of HCC.

Knockdown of EMP3 markedly suppressed cell
proliferation in both cell lines as measured by cell
growth (Figure 2A) and clonogenic property (Figure 2B).
In addition, knockdown of EMP3 resulted in cell cycle
arrest at G1 phase (Figure 2C) and increasing the levels
of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors, p21, p27, and the
phosphorylation status of p53, but reducing the levels
of SKP2, cyclin E, and cyclin D1 (Figure 2D). These
results suggest that EMP3 is involved in regulation of
cell proliferation and cell cycle progression of HCC
cells in vitro.

Knockdown of EMP3 suppresses cell
proliferation, cell cycle progression, and tumor
growth of HCC
To determine the effects of EMP3 on HCC
cells, EMP3 was knocked down by the specific short
hairpin RNA (shRNA) in SK-Hep-1 and Huh-7 cells.

relative amount of each protein comparing to that in shLuc cells was shown in the bottom. Nude mice were subcutaneously inoculated with
5 × 106 shLuc- or shEMP3-cells and the tumor volume was measured at indicated time intervals. The representative results of tumor mass
in each group were shown in E. The representative results of IHC staining against EMP3 and Ki-67 and hematoxylin and eosin (H & E)

5 mice were shown, respectively. Data are presented as the mean ± SE of at least three independent experiments. *, p < 0.05; **, p < 0.01.

To address the role of EMP3 in tumorigenesis
of HCC in vivo, the EMP3-knockdown (shEMP3)- or
Luc-knockdown (shLuc)-SK-Hep-1 cells were injected
subcutaneously and the tumor growth was measured
(Figure 2E). The expressions of EMP3 and a proliferation
marker, Ki-67, were much lower in the tissue sections
from shEMP3-SK-Hep-1 cell-inoculated mice than
that from control shLuc-SK-Hep-1 cell-inoculated one
(Figure 2F). The tumor volume (Figure 2G) and tumor
weight (Figure  2H) were significantly decreased in
shEMP3-SK-Hep-1 cell -inoculated mice without altering
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

the body weight (Figure 2I). These results provided
the evidence that EMP3 is conversely correlated to
tumorigenesis of HCC in vivo.

expression of EMP3 was decreased in the shEMP3-cells,
the expressions of MMP-9 and uPA were significantly
reduced in comparison with that in the control shLuc-cells
(Figure 3B). The results from zymography revealed that

proteolytic activities of MMP-9 and uPA were obviously
reduced after knockdown of EMP3; however, MMP2
activity did not altered (Figure 3C). The reduced levels
of MMP-9 and uPA after knockdown of EMP3 were also
observed by immunofluorescence staining (Figure 3D).
Taken together, the results suggest that silencing EMP3-

recuced migratory and invasive abilities of HCC cells
might be properly due to suppression of MMP-9 and uPA.

Moreover, while knockdown of EMP3 resulted in cell cycle
arrest at G1 phase in accordance with decreased p-Akt
and cyclin D1 and increased p21 and p27, treatment of
LY294002 or knockdown of Akt further facilitated EMP3
knockdown-induced G1 arrest (black bars, Figure 4D),
p21 and p27 amounts (Figure- 4E). Taken together, these
results demonstrated that suppression of cell proliferation
and induction of cell cycle arrest caused by knockdown of
EMP3 were mainly via inactivation of PI3K/Akt pathway.
While inhibition of PI3K by LY294002 or
knockdown of EMP3 suppressed the migratory
and invasive abilities (Figure 5A), and reduced the
phosphorylation of Akt and the expression of MMP-9
and uPA (Figure 5B) in both SK-Hep-1 and Huh-7 HCC
cells, treatment of LY294002 further enhanced the EMP3
knockdown-induced inhibition of the aforementioned
phenomena (right black bars, Figure 5A and right lanes,
Figure 5B). Moreover, knockdown of Akt synergistically
inhibited the EMP3 knockdown-reduced motility
and invasiveness (right black bars, Figure 5C), and
expressions of MMP-9 and uPA (right lanes, Figure 5D).
However, knockdown of ERK did not affect the EMP3
knockdown-reduced malignant properties of migration
and invasion in both SK-Hep-1 and Huh-7 HCC cells
(Supplemental Figure-1). In contrast, overexpression of

EMP3-regulated cell proliferation and
malignancy of HCC cells are mainly through
PI3K/AKT pathway
To clarify the signaling pathway of EMP3-regulated
cell proliferation and malignancy of HCC cells, the
phosphorylation of ERK (p-ERK) and Akt (p-Akt,)
were examined. Knockdown of EMP3 significantly
reduced the levels of p-ERK and p-Akt, without altering
the total amounts of ERK and Akt (Figure 4A). In the
control shLuc-cells, disruption of MEK/ERK or PI3K/
Akt pathway by a MEK inhibitor, PD98059, or a PI3K
inhibitor, LY294002, respectively, suppressed cell growth,
and knockdown of ERK or Akt also effectively reduced
cell growth (white bars, Figure 4B). In the shEMP3-cells,
treatment of LY294002 or knockdown of Akt further
enhanced the inhibition of cell growth; however, treatment
of PD98059 or knockdown of ERK did not alter shEMP3reduced cell growth (black bars, Figure 4B). Similarly,
disruption of PI3K/Akt pathway by addition of LY294002
or knockdown of Akt also further inhibited the shEMP3reduced clonogenic ability (black bars, Figure 4C).

EMP3 is clinical relative to the expression of p85,

from HCC patients

(right lanes, Figure 5F) in the shEMP3-cells. Furthermore,
overexpression of EMP3 enhanced malignant properties of
Huh-7 cells, including promoting cell growth, migration,
and invasion. Identically, overexpression of EMP3 resulted
in reduced p21 and p27 levels, increased cyclin D1, uPA,
and MMP-9 levels, as well as activation of MMP-9 and
uPA activities (Supplemental Figure-2). Taken together,
these results indicated that knockdown of EMP3 inhibits
the expression of MMP-9 and uPA, and reduces the
abilities of migration and invasion is through inactivation
of PI3K/Akt pathway. Oppositely, overexpression of
EMP3 facilitates aggressiveness of HCC cells.

To determine the potential clinical significance
of EMP3 and PI3K/Akt and uPA/MMP-9 pathways,
the tissue sections from clinical HCC patients were
collected and applied to immunohistochemical (IHC)
staining against these proteins. As shown in Figure 6, the
expression of EMP3 was significantly positive-correlated
to the expression of p85 regulatory subunit of PI3K
(R =0.3851, p < 0.001), p-Akt (R = 0.3789, p < 0.001),

as well as uPA (R = 0.4986, p < 0.001) and MMP-9
(R = 0.3697, p < 0.001) in the tissue sections from HCC
patients. In accordance with EMP3, the expressions of
p85, p-Akt, uPA, and MMP-9 were significantly correlated
to poorly differentiated stage in HCC patients. Among
these molecules, p85 was also correlated to tumor stage.
However, all these molecules were not significantly related
to HCC patients’ age and gender (Table 1). Taken together,
these results suggest that EMP3 might up-regulate PI3K/
Akt pathway and uPA/MMP-9 cascade, leading to
progression of HCC development.

that EMP3 might be a tumor suppressor gene in glioma
[13–16], neuroblastoma [13, 17], esophageal squamous
cell carcinoma (ESCC) cell lines [20], and non-small cell
lung cancer (NSCLC) [18]. Treating neuroblastoma cell
lines with a demethylating agent, 5-aza-2-deoxycytidine,
to restore EMP3 expression reduced colony formation
density and tumor growth in nude mouse xenograft
models [13]. Overexpression of EMP3 resulted in growth
inhibition and TERT repression in ESCC cell lines
[20]. Releasing A549, a NSCLC cell line, from serum
starvation to trigger its cell cycle progression repressed
the expression of EMP3 [18]. However, overexpression
of EMP3 is related to retain chromosomes 1p and 19q in
oligodendroglial tumors [21], and relevant to histological
grade III, lymph node metastasis, and strong Her-2
expression in primary breast carcinoma [22]. Recently,
functional crosstalk between EMP3 and ErbB2 has
been reported. Overexpression of EMP3 promotes cell
proliferation and migration and is clinically associated
with poor patient survival and metastasis-free survival.
Co-expression of EMP3 and ErbB2 is worse for
progression-free and metastasis-free survival in patients
with upper urinary tract urothelial carcinoma [23]. In our
study, we found that knockdown of EMP3 suppresses cell
proliferation, cell cycle progression, migration, invasion,
and tumor growth of HCC cells. Clinical significance
is also observed, namely higher expression of EMP3 in
tumorous tissues and associated with poor differentiated
stage of HCC patients. These aforementioned studies
indicate the potential tumor promoting functions of
EMP3 in other cancer types including oligodendroglioma,
breast carcinoma, urothelial carcinoma, and hepatoma,
suggesting that the roles of EMP3 in cancer progression
might depend on cancer types.
The activation of p110 catalytic subunit of
PI3K results from the binding of its p85 regulatory
subunit to receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs). Activated
PI3K catalyzes the formation of phosphatidylinositol
3,4,5 trisphosphate (PIP3), which in turn activates
phosphoinositide-dependent kinase-1 (PDK1), leading to
activation of Akt. The PI3K/Akt signaling pathway affects
multiple cellular processes including cell proliferation,
survival, and motility [25]. Activation of PI3K by ErbB2,
which has kinase activity and lacks p85-binding sites,
depends on assistance of ErbB3, which lacks tyrosine
kinase activity and possesses six p85-binding sites, for
recruitment of PI3K. Transactivation of heterodimer of
ErbB2-ErbB3 is important oncogenic signaling involved
in the PI3K/Akt pathway [26]. Recently, it has been
reported that ErbB2 and EMP3 reciprocally up-regulate
each other accompanied with activation of PI3K/Akt
pathway to promote proliferation and migration of human
bladder cancer cells [23]. In the present study, knockdown
of EMP3 reduces the expression and association of p85
subunit of PI3K to inactivate Akt, leading to inhibition of
cell proliferation, migration, and invasion of HCC cells.

Knockdown of EMP3 reduces the expression
and association of p85 regulatory subunit and
inhibits PI3K activity
To further explore the role of EMP3 in PI3K/Akt
pathway, the expressions of subunits of PI3K and their
interaction were determined. Knockdown of EMP3
reduced the expression level of the regulatory subunit of
PI3K, p85, but did not alter the expression of the catalytic
subunit of PI3K, p110 (Figure 7A). The association
between EMP3 and p85 were demonstrated by reciprocal
immunoprecipitation (IP)/immunoblotting (IB) approach
with anti-EMP3 and anti-p85 antibodies, respectively
(Figure 7B). The co-localization of EMP3 and p85 was
also observed by IF staining (Figure 7C). The association
and co-localization of EMP3 and p85 were reduced after
knockdown of EMP3 (Figures 7D and 7E). The results
from functional analysis of PI3K revealed that knockdown
of EMP3 significantly inhibited the kinase activity of PI3K
in both SK-Hep-1 and Huh-7 cells (Figure 7F). These
results suggested that knockdown of EMP3 decreases the
expression of p85 and inhibits PI3K activity, leading to
inactivation of Akt.
In summary, we provided evidence showing that
EMP3 associates with PI3K-p85 involved in activation of
PI3K/Akt pathway to promote cell cycle progression and
proliferation, and also to enhance uPA/MMP-9 required
for migration and invasion in HCC cells (left, Figure 7G);
in contrast, targeting EMP3 with shRNA to decrease
the level of EMP3 results in reduction of PI3K-p85 and
inactivation of PI3K/Akt, which contribute to inhibition
of cell proliferation by decreased cycle progression at
G1 phase, and suppression of migration and invasion by
down-regulation of uPA/MMP-9 cascade in HCC cells
(right, Figure 7G). The findings suggest that EMP3 might
serve as a potential therapeutic target for HCC.

DISCUSSION
EMP3 shares approximate 40% amino acid identity
with PMP22, which is the best characterized member
of the family and implicated in the regulation of cell
proliferation [11]. Accumulated evidence suggested

MATERIALS AND METHODS

It is possible that EMP3-regulated p85 expression and
association might be probably related to expression or
activation of RTKs, such as ErbB2-ErbB3. In addition, it
has been reported that EMP3 interacts with C terminus
of P2X7 receptor (P2X7R) involved in cell blebbing [27].
Recently, the promoting effects of P2X7R on tumor
growth have been demonstrated in vivo, and the clinical
positive-correlation of P2X7R has been also observed in
many cancers [28]. The roles of EMP3 in activation of
PI3K by ErbB2-ErbB3 and in tumor promotion by P2X7R
need to be further explored.
In addition, EMP-1, one of EMP family members,
has also been reported to be involved in activation of
PI3K/Akt pathway in lung cancer. They demonstrated that
EMP-1 was significantly up-regulated in NSCLC patients
comparing to that in benign patients. Overexpression of
EMP-1 resulted in increasing cell proliferation of PC9
NSCLC cells in accordance with activation of the PI3K/
Akt pathway. EMP-1 promoted tumor growth of PC9 cells
was also observed in vivo in a nude mouse xenograft model
[29]. In contrast, the expression of EMP-3 was suppressed
in proliferating A549 NSCLC cells [18]. Although the
amino acid sequences of EMP family members are highly
homologous, their functions in lung cancer progression
are diverse, suggesting that the downstream signaling
pathways of EMPs are critical in their effect on tumor
progression. Activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway by EMP1 in NSCLC cells [18] or by EMP-3 in HCC cells in the
current study promoted tumor aggressiveness.
The uPA/MMPs cascade has been demonstrated to be
involved in malignancy of HCC [8, 9], in particular MMP-2
[30–34] and MMP-9 [34–39]. For instance, MMP-2 and uPA
are involved in osteopontin-mediated metastasis [33].
Expression of MMP-2 and vascular endothelial growth
factor (VEGF) is closely related to invasion and metastasis
[30, 31]. Expression of MMP-2 and cytokeratin 19 are
independent risk factors for prediction of lymph node
metastasis and survival [32]. Several signaling pathways
mediated by different modulators have been known to
activate MMP-9 in invasion and metastasis of HCC cells,
including focal adhesion kinase (FAK)/extracellular signalregulated kinase (ERK) axis by epimorphin [36], NFkappa B by interleukin 23 [37], PTEN/PI3K/AKT pathway
by Bmi-1 [34]. In contrast, the expression of MMP-9 is
repressed by miR-491 [38] and forkhead box transcription
factor A2 (FOXA2) [39]. In addition, membrane type
1-matrix metalloproteinase (MT1-MMP) [40] and MMP10
[41] are also involved in metastasis of HCC cells. MT1MMP increases invasion and intrahepatic metastasis by
degradation of ECM, and enhances cell survival upon
challenge of detachment of HCC cells [40]. C-terminal
truncated hepatitis B virus x (HBx) protein promotes
invasiveness and metastasis of HCC cells by activating
MMP10 through C-Jun [41]. Our study reveals that EMP3
contributes to tumor aggressiveness by MMP-9 and uPA,
but not MMP2, on the PI3K/AKT pathway in HCC cells.

the manual. Briefly, to generate the lentivirus containing
specific shRNA, HEK-293T cells were co-transfected
with 2.25 μg of pCMV-ΔR8.91 plasmid with Gag and
Pol genes, 0.25 μg of pMD.G plasmid with VSV-G gene,
and 2.5 μg of pLKO.1 plasmid with specific shRNA for
16 h and then cultured in culture medium containing
1% BSA for another 24 h. The cultured medium
containing  lentivirus was collected and stored at −80
°C as aliquots for further use. To deliver the specific
shRNA construct, approximately 80% confluent cells
were infected with the lentivirus bearing specific shRNA
in culture medium containing 8 μg/mL polybrene and
incubated at 37 °C for 24 h. Subsequently, cells were
subcultured and selected  with 4 μg/mL puromycin.
The shRNAs against EMP3 is TRCN0000116049
(shEMP3)
corresponding
to
the
sequences,
5′-CGCCTTGATCTATGCCATTCA-3′. The shRNA
construct against luciferase (shLuc), TRCN0000072244
referring to the sequence, 5, TRCN0000072244 referring
was used as a negative control.

Equal amounts of protein extracts were separated by
sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis
(SDS-PAGE) and then transferred onto a polyvinylidene
fluoride (PVDF) membrane (Millipore, Belford, MA).
The membrane was blocked with 5% skim milk at room
temperature for 1 h, and then hybridized with specific
primary antibody at 4oC overnight. After washing,
the membrane was incubated with HRP-conjugated
suitable secondary antibody at room temperature for 2 h.
Subsequently, proteins were visualized by addition of
enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) reagent (Millipore,
Billerica, USA).

Immunofluorescence (IF) staining
The day before experiment, cells were seeded on an
8 well Lab-Tek Chambered coverglass (Thermo, Rochester,
NY). The slides were washed with phosphate-buffered saline
(PBS) and cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde,
followed by permeabilization with methanol. After washing
with PBS, the slides were blocked with 2% bovine serum
albumin (BSA), followed by incubation with primary
and secondary antibodies in 5% BSA. Subsequently, the
slides were mounted in the mounting solution (Invitrogen)
containing DAPI for counterstaining cell nucleus. The
cell images were observed and photographed under an
immunofluorescence microscopy.

MTT assay
The cell growth was measured by MTT assay. Cells
were seeded at a density of 4 × 104 cells/well in a 24-well
plate and cultured for indicated time intervals. At each
time interval, the medium was replaced with fresh cell
culture medium containing 0.5 mg/mL MTT for 4 h. The
number of viable cells was proportional to the amount of
formazan, a reduction product of MTT, by dehydrogenases
in the mitochondria within live cells. Afterward, the
medium was removed and the produced formazan was
dissolved in isopropanol and measured at 570 nm by a
Multiskan MS ELSA reader (Labsystems, Helsinki,
Finland). The relative cell number was normalized by the
absorbance from the control cells.

Tissue array and immunohistochemical (IHC)
staining
Human HCC tissue array (LV1002) was purchased
from US Biomax, Inc., and analyzed according to
the manufacturer’s instruction. In Brief, the tissue
sections were deparaffinized and rehydrated, followed
by quenching endogenous tissue peroxides. The slides
of HCC tissue array were incubated with 1% hydrogen
peroxide at room temperature for 10 min, and then
blocked with 5% BSA for 30 min. The slides were
initially hybridized with primary antibody (1:100) at
room temperature for 1 h. After washing, the slides were
hybridized with HRP-conjugated secondary antibody
(1:1000) for 30 min, and then visualized by addition
of peroxidase substrate for 1–10 min until the desired
stain intensity developed. Subsequently, the cells in the
tissue sections were counterstained with hematoxylin.
The images were observed and photographed under a
microscopy

Colony formation assay
Cells were seeded at a density of 5 × 103 cells/
well in a six-well plate and cultured for 14 days. The
surviving colonies (>50 cells/colony) were stained with
1% crystal violet and the number of colony was counted.
The experiments were performed in triplicate.

Flow cytometric analysis
Cell cycle was analyzed by flow cytometry.
Briefly, 2 × 105 cells were harvested and washed with
PBS, and then fixed in 75% alcohol at 4°C for 30 min.
After washing, cells were re-suspended in 1 m1 of PBS
containing 2 mg/m1 of propidium iodide (PI), 0.5 mg/ml
RNase A, and 1% Triton X-100 and incubated at 37°C for
30 min in dark. Samples were then detected for their DNA
content using a FACSCalibur flow cytometer and the data
were analyzed by Cell Quest software (BD Bioscience,
Bedford, MA).

In vitro cell migration and invasion assay

(L2)2, where L1 and L2 represent the long and short axes
of the tumor, respectively. The mice were sacrificed after
35 days. The primary tumors were excised, weighed,
photographed, and sectioned for IHC staining.

In vitro cell migration and invasion assay was
performed as described previously [24]. For the migration
assay, 5 × 104 cells were re-suspended in serum-free
medium and placed in the upper chamber of the well
insert with 8 μm pore size polycarbonate membrane
filter (Millipore). DMEM containing 20% FBS was
placed in the lower chamber. For the invasion assay, the
experimental procedures are similar to the migration assay
as described above, except the well insert was coated with
10 μl Matrigel (5 mg/mL; BD Biosciences) (50 μg/well).
After incubation for 18 h or 24 h at 37°C in the migration
or invasion assay, respectively, the cells on the upper
surface of the membrane were removed by cotton swab,
The migrated or invaded cells on the lower surface of the
membrane were fixed with methanol and stained with
0.05% Giemsa, and the cells were counted under a light
microscope at 200X magnification. This experiment was
performed twice independently. The data are presented as
mean ± SD of 5 fields from each well of triplicate samples.

PI3K activity assay
Cell lysate was immunoprecipitated with anti-p85
antibody and Protein A/G Agarose beads (Santa Cruz
Biotechnology). The measurement of PI3K activity
was analyzed by PI3K kinase ELISA assay (Echelon
Biosciences, Salt Lake City, UT) according to the
manufacturer's instructions.

Statistical analysis
The results were presented as mean ± standard
error (SE) from three independent experiments. Data
were analyzed using Instat software (GraphPad Prism4,
San Diego, CA). Student's t-test or one-way analysis
of variance (ANOVA) with a post-hoc analysis using
Tukey's multiple-comparison test was used for obtaining
parametric data. P < 0.05 or P < 0.01 was considered to be
statistically significant.

Zymography
The proteolytic activity of MMP-9, MMP-2, and
uPA was examined by casein zymography with gelatin
and casein, respectively. Cells were cultured in serumfree media for 48 h, and the conditioned medium was then
collected. Equal amounts of concentrated media were
separated by SDS-PAGE containing 0.2% gelatin or 0.1%
casein (Sigma). After electrophoresis, gels were washed
with washing buffer (2.5% Triton X-100 in distilled water)
three times at room temperature for 20 min. The gel was
equilibrated in the developing buffer by gentle agitation
at room temperature for 20 min, and then incubated with
fresh developing buffer (50 mM Tris–HCl pH 7.5, 0.15 M
NaCl, 10 mM CaCl2, and 0.05% NaN3) at 37°C for 24 h.
Bands corresponding to proteolytic activity of MMP-9,
MMP-2, and uPA were visualized by negative staining
with 0.3% Coomassie blue in 50% methanol and 10%
acetic acid.
