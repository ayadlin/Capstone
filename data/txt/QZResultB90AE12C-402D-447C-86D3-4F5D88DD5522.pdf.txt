ABSTRACT
Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma has limited treatment options. There is an
urgent need for developing appropriate pre-clinical models recapitulating metastatic
disease, the most common clinical scenario at presentation. Ascites accumulation
occurs in up to 20–30% of patients with pancreatic cancer; this milieu represents
a highly cellular research resource of metastatic peritoneal spread. In this study,
we utilized pancreatic ascites/pleural effusion cancer cells to establish patient
derived xenografts.
Ascites/pleural effusion-patient derived xenografts were established from
twelve independent cases. Xenografts were serially passed in nude mice and tissue
bio-specimen banking has been established. Histopathology of emergent tumors
demonstrates poorly to moderately differentiated, glandular and mucin producing
tumors, mirroring morphology of primary pancreatic cancer tumors. Whole genome
sequencing of six patient derived xenografts samples demonstrates common
mutations and structural variations similar to those reported in primary pancreatic
cancer. Xenograft tumors were dissociated to single-cells and in-vitro drug sensitivity
screen assays demonstrated chemo-resistance, correlating with patient clinical
scenarios, thus serving as a platform for clinically relevant translational research.
Therefore, establishment of this novel ascites/pleural effusion patient derived
xenograft model, with extensive histopathology and genomic characterization,
opens an opportunity for the study of advanced aggressive pancreatic cancer.
Characterization of metastatic disease and mechanisms of resistance to therapeutics
may lead to the development of novel drug combinations.

INTRODUCTION

We have previously characterized the utilization
of PDAC ascites fluid as a platform for personalized
medicine [26]. Herein, we describe the establishment of
ascites and pleural effusion – derived PDX and a detailed
histopathology and whole-genome sequencing analysis of
representative cases.

Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is one
of the most lethal malignancies with limited treatment
options. Drug combinations including FOLFIRINOX or
gemcitabine plus nab-paclitaxel have improved progression
free survival and overall survival [1, 2], yet the 5-year
survival rate remains dismal ~6% [3]. To date, surgical
resection is the only potential cure; however, only 15–20%
of patients are eligible for surgery, and most still die within
two years of surgery due to recurrence of disease [4].
Most patients are diagnosed with metastatic disease and
treatment options are limited. Molecular phenotypes are
emerging in PDAC and the therapeutic relevance of these
phenotypes at advanced disease needs to be thoroughly
investigated. Recent classification of primary PDAC into
subtypes from whole genome sequencing (WGS) data
has been performed [5, 6]. The most clinically relevant
subtype has genomic instability enriched with a mutational
signature of DNA damage repair deficiency [7].
Translational research requires well-validated preclinical models that reflect the pathological, cellular and
molecular properties of human PDAC. Established cell
lines undergo selective pressure and genetic drift during
decades of in vitro passaging [8]. Genetically engineered
mice (GEM) with mutations in KRAS and p53 [9],
SMAD4 [10] and P16/INK4 [11] have been established,
however, these models frequently have incomplete
penetrance, long latency periods and are limited to specific,
predefined genetic mutations [12].
Models that more accurately reflect tumor
heterogeneity and tumor complexity are needed.
Hidalgo et al, implanted 94 resected primary PDAC of
which 61% successfully engrafted [13]. These patient
derived xenografts (PDX) closely recapitulate human
tumor histopathology, including stroma formation, and
with preserved heterogeneity [14, 15]. PDX have also
been established from PDAC fine needle aspirates [16]
and liver metastasis core-needle biopsies [17]. These
xenografts derived directly from patient samples, without
in vitro manipulation, provide a more accurate depiction
of stage dependent biologic characteristics and may have
complimentary value in characterizing advanced PDAC
[18–21, 22].
Most common sites for pancreatic metastases
include liver, lung and the peritoneum. Approximately
one third of patients with PDAC have peritoneal spread of
disease, which may lead to ascites accumulation [23, 24]
and palliative paracentesis is performed when clinically
required. Pleural effusion also occurs in a small percentage
of patients. Symptomatic fluid accumulation usually
occurs at the clinically treatment resistant stage, late in the
course of the disease. Ascites and pleural effusion contains
viable tumor cells [25], and therefore it is compelling to
develop investigational models based on primary tumor
cells obtained from this fluid.

RESULTS
Clinical characterization
Herein we present clinical characteristics of
seventeen PDAC patients with malignant ascites or pleural
effusion. Median overall survival of all patients was 8.2
months. Mean time from paracentesis to death was 42
days. Clinical data is described in Supplementary Table 1.

Establishment of ascites and pleural effusion
PDAC patient-derived xenograft model
Malignant ascites and pleural effusion fluid
demonstrated tumor cells positive for Muc1, BerEP4, TAG-72 and CEA (Figure 1A, arrow) (n = 20).
Ascites fluid from cirrhosis patients served as control,
demonstrating mesothelial cells and lymphocytes. To
date, a total of 20 malignant ascites fluids (AF) and
pleural effusions (PE) (PE 2/20) from 17 different patients,
were subcutaneously injected into athymic nude mice to
generate first (F1) generation PDX (n = 1 or 2). Successful
tumor engraftment was demonstrated in 12/17 patients
(70%). Herein we present phenotypic (n = 8) and genomic
molecular characterization (n = 6) of established PDXs.
A minimal detectable tumor (100 mm3) was
observed 20–87 days after cells injection (mean- 44),
and an exponential growth trend was observed thereafter
illustrating variation in tumor growth kinetics between
PDXs (Figure 1Bi, ii). Xenografts from established
pancreatic cell lines (Capan1, AsPC1 and Panc1) were
generated for comparison (Figure 1Bi; grey curves).
Serial passaging was performed from all xenografts with
100% uptake. A PDX tissue bank for future preclinical
experiments was generated. Third- generation PDXs were
excited and preserved in Liquid Nitrogen. Representative
frozen PDXs were thawed and transplanted to mice with
~90% uptake.
We propose an expeditious unique method for
generation of metastatic PDAC PDX model (Figure 1C).

Histopathologic characterization of PDX
Pancreatic primary tumors and liver metastasis
are characterized by desmoplastic stroma containing
fibroblasts, endothelial and immune cells. Our PDX
tumors were compared to clinical diagnostic tissue
when available (Figure 2A). Histologic evaluation of
PDX’s demonstrated glandular forming moderately

to poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma. Mucin
production was evident in five PDXs (Figure 2B). In
contrast, tumors generated from established pancreatic
cell lines demonstrated sheets of undifferentiated
tumor cell growth with <5% gland formation. Human
leucocyte antigen (HLA) staining was positive in cancer
epithelial cells whereas stromal cells remained unstained
(Figure 2B).
Desmoplastic stroma was evident in all PDXs
however the type and percentage of stroma varied between
tumors. In all PDXs, the periphery of the tumors tended
to have a cellular inflammatory interface with the mouse
subcutaneous tissue (Figure 3A) while the center of the
tumors had a paucity of inflammatory cells. Two distinct
growth patterns of stroma were observed: 1. Inflammatory
cellular stroma (Figure 3Bi) (n = 2) 2. Collagen rich cell
poor stroma (Figure 3Bii) (n = 5).
PDX’s tumors were graded as poorly (n = 4) and
moderately (n = 3) differentiated; one PDX (patient 105)
demonstrated two growth patterns: moderately
differentiated adenocarcinoma and undifferentiated
tumor growth (Figure 3C). In 5/6 PDXs, the histologic
parameters were consistent throughout serial passaging.
In the one PDX with the bi-phasic growth pattern seen on
generation F1 (pt. 105), subsequent passages showed only
the moderately differentiated portion of the tumor.

Of note, the PDAC ascites/pleural effusion PDXs
accurately recapitulated the phenotypic features of PDAC
primary tumors.

Short tandem repeat (STR) profiling
DNA from F1 generation PDX and matching
patients’ germline DNA (n = 8) were isolated and STR
at 16 different loci were compared. All samples were
classified in 80%-100% match range, reflecting that both
samples are related (same donor). All PDXs had LOH in
one to seven loci (median-3) (Supplementary Figure 1A).
Chromosomal gain of one locus was observed in two
PDX samples (pt. 105, pt. 144). Chromosomal loss or
deletions within the Y chromosome were observed in
three male patients’ (pt.86, pt.90 and pt.105) PDXs. Loss
of the Y chromosome has also been observed in a number
of patient tumors in various cancer types [27–29, 30].
Overall, genetic identity between our PDXs and matching
germline is preserved.

In vitro establishment of PDX-derived tumor cell
cultures
PDXs were excised, and digested to single cells.
Initially, a mixed population of epithelial and stromal cells

in islands. HLA positive staining of PDX derived culture
indicated human origin (Figure 4A). Ascites cultures
served as positive control (Supplementary Figure 1B).
Doubling time of PDX-derived cells ranged
between 38 to 70 hours, compared to 32 to 49 hours of
the established cell lines (Panc1, AsPC1 and Capan1)
(data not shown). Cultures remain stable in doubling time
and morphology for more than 20 passages. Additionally,
cultures are being routinely authenticated and stained for
EpCAM (data not shown).

were detected by IVIS (In Vivo Imaging System) in PDX
87-GFP/Luc animal group (n = 6), no sign of metastasis
was identified in PDX 99-GFP/Luc group (Figure 4Bi).
Mice were sacrificed and organs were harvested. Imaging
by fluorescent binocular microscope for GFP showed
numerous metastasis in lungs and pancreas of PDX 87GFP/Luc group (Figure 4Bii, upper panel), while in PDX
99-GFP/Luc group we saw reduced number of detectable
metastatic nodules in lungs and no metastases were
observed microscopically in the pancreas (Figure 4Bii,
lower panel).

Establishment of a metastatic PDX model

To investigate whether the emergent tumors
in ascites/pleural effusion PDXs reflect the primary
pancreatic cancer tumors and to gain insights into genomic
molecular alterations of advanced PDAC disease, we
performed whole genome sequencing on both the (F1)
xenograft from each individual as well as DNA obtained
from patient’s blood (n = 6). The xenograft genome was
compared to the matched normal blood genome in order
to identify somatic mutations.

Whole genome sequencing

PDX- derived cells from two different patients (pt.
87 and 99) were stably transfected with Green Fluorescent
Protein (GFP) and Luciferase (see methods section). We
determined the ability of the GFP-Luc transfected cells to
form metastases in NOG (NOD/Shi-scid IL2rgamma(null)
mice, utilizing a tail vein injection procedure. Eight weeks
post injection, numerous metastases in the lung region

We detected a median of 6250 (range 2059–7688)
somatic SNV alterations in our PDX models. 237 nonsynonymous somatic SNVs were identified across all
PDXs, including 11 stopgains, with a median of 38 nonsynonymous somatic variants per PDX (range 12–65).
A total of 5 splice altering SNVs were also detected
(range 0–3).
The most common substitution was the C > T
transition, which accounted for 38% of somatic SNVs
detected. Each sample was dominated by C > T
substitutions (ranging from 33%-43%) which is consistent
with the Age Related mutational signature commonly
observed in other PDAC samples [31].
The median number of small somatic insertions
and deletions (INDELs) detected in all samples was 587
(range 234–905). Somatic insertions ranged from 146 to
580 with a median of 327 variants identified, and somatic
deletions ranged from 88 to 325 with a median of 267
variants identified. 94% of insertions and 76% of deletions
affected 3 or fewer base pairs (insertions ranged from 90%
to 97%, deletions from 74% to 80%). 15 somatic INDELs
resulting in frameshifts were detected in the samples
(range 0–5) and one sample (pt. 99) had 2 non-frameshift
variants.
Neo-antigen load (the number of novel peptides
created by somatic SNVs and INDELs and predicted to have
a high affinity to the HLA types identified in the patient)
ranged from 18 in pt. 90 to 58 in pt. 105, with a median of
39.5, which is in line with the median neo-antigen load of 48
for a series of 160 PDAC whole genomes [6].

We identified 448 structural variations across
all PDXs, with a median of 52 per PDX sample (range
25–223). Deletions larger than 1 kilobase, duplications,
and inversions accounted for 131, 158, and 118 events,
respectively. 41 Translocations were identified. We
classified the samples based on the pattern of structural
rearrangements according to the Waddell et al. system
[5]; Three cases were Stable (pt. 73, pt. 90 and pt. 105),
one was Locally Rearranged (pt. 99), one was Scattered
(pt. 86) and one was Unstable (pt. 87). The Unstable
class tumor was enriched with duplication variants, as it
contained 70% of the SVs of that type observed in any of
the 6 -PDX samples (Figure 5).
In total, 254 variants were found to change the
protein-coding sequence in 239 genes, including 5 that
are significantly mutated in PDAC (KRAS in six, TP53 in
four, CDKN2A in two, TGFBR2 in one and U2AF1 in one
PDX). In addition, of the 448 structural variants detected,
297 had breakpoints within the transcript of genes and four
PDAC genes were affected (TP53, CDKN2A, TGFBR2
and MAP2K4). Commonly found (>2 samples) SNV and
INDELs across all PDXs is presented (Supplementary
Table 2).
The most common mutated gene was KRAS (G12D,
n = 3; G12V, n = 2; Q61H, n = 1). These mutations were
verified by Sanger sequencing (data not shown). KRAS
was also found to be amplified in 3 of the 6 samples. The
second most commonly mutated gene was TP53, which
was somatically altered in 5/6 PDXs and also underwent
loss of one copy in 5/6 cases. CDKN2A appeared to be

DISCUSSION

biallelically inactivated in all six cases; three by mutation
and loss of heterozygosity, and three by two copy deletion.
SMAD4 was not found to be mutated in any of the PDXs,
but did lose a single copy of the gene in four of six samples.
PDX WGS was compared to mutation panel from
primary diagnostic biopsy (EUS FNA) of pt. 99. Three
non-synonymous mutation were demonstrated in primary
biopsy: KRAS, PIK3CA and FLCN; all mutations were
identified in ascites PDX (Supplementary Table 3).

We previously described the characterization of
ascites derived PDAC cells (ref; Golan). Herein, we
present a rapid and novel xenograft model utilizing highly
chemo-resistant metastatic PDAC cells. Harnessing these
cancer cells from a palliative procedure for generation of
PDX provides an opportunity for the study of resistant
metastatic PDAC in vivo.
The ascites/pleural effusion PDXs, generated from
single cells in suspension, developed glandular forming
mucin producing PDAC, demonstrating the multipluripotent nature of these cells. The PDX tissues retain
morphology, architecture, and molecular signatures similar
to original PDAC tumors. Variation in tumor growth kinetic
was observed between patients, the latter may rise from
initial differences in the number of malignant cells in the
milieu and from clonal heterogeneity. No spontaneous
metastases nor ascites/pleural effusion dispersing was
observed in the subcutaneous model. Preliminary
experiments utilizing GFP labeled PDX derived cells for
generation of a metastatic model has shown spontaneous
lung metastases (Figure 4B).
Desmoplasia is a prominent characteristic of
PDAC which contains extensive stroma that constitutes
up to ~80–90% of the tumor volume [33]. An extensive
desmoplastic reaction was observed in all PDXs. Some
cases show a more extensive stroma-rich and lymphocytepoor reaction and others the opposite. The single cancer
cells derived from ascites fluid and pleural effusion were
able to form tumors with a significant desmoplastic
reaction in a similar fashion to solid pancreatic masses.
The clinical immunotherapeutic relevance of these
findings should be further evaluated in alternative models.
Extensive efforts regarding WGS analysis of
PDAC has been undertaken, however the majority of
the information gathered has been from primary tumors
[5, 32, 6]. Our study attempts to rigorously identify, expand
and perform WGS on advanced therapeutic resistant tumor
cells to develop a platform to test drug combinations and
specifically discover resistance pathways. The PDXs
genomic analysis display significant overlap with available
sequencing data on primary tumors [34]. The driver
mutations are identified in early stage of disease and remain
constant during disease progression. For example: PDX 87
displays an unstable genome. Of importance, the classical
BRCAness phenotype [7] accumulates small deletions
(3 bp–10 kbp) and also shows a point mutation signature
[5], these features were not seen in this case despite the
‘unstable genome’. This patient’s clinical scenario and
his genomic analysis demonstrating accumulation of
duplications may be a result of some yet to be established
DNA repair deficiency. The unstable genome may be in the
spectrum of DDR as evidenced by an initial good response
to chemotherapy, yet it does not fully satisfy mutational
signature. The therapeutic relevance of his unstable

PDX classified with an “unstable subtype”
Recent sequencing efforts have divided PDAC
tumors into potential therapeutic subtypes [32, 6]. One
subtype (unstable genome) is enriched with tumors
demonstrating DNA damage repair deficiency (DDR
subtype) [5]. The therapeutic relevance of these subtypes
in advanced disease has not been thoroughly investigated.
One of our PDX models demonstrated an unstable
genome, generated from patient with a favorable clinical
response. Patient # 87 was a 66-year-old male, diagnosed
with stage IV PDAC with liver metastases. He received
three therapeutic lines (Supplementary Table 1) and
demonstrated a superior OS of 17 months (Figure 6A).
PDX 87 WGS data displayed mutational load of 6,451
SNV and considerably high load of structural variations,
enriched with duplications (Figure 6B) and classified as
an unstable genome subtype of Waddell et al. [5]. A nonsynonymous somatic RAD51C variant was identified
(c.C236G) in WGS. RAD51C is involved in DNA repair
and germline RAD51C mutations are associated with
Fanconi-anemia like syndrome. We are uncertain whether
this particular variant generates a functionally defective
protein in PDAC though we note the Waddell unstable
genome in this case. Additional alterations in Homologous
recombination deficiency (HRD) genes were observed in
pt. 87 PDX (Figure 6C).

In vitro and in vivo sensitivity assays
PDX-derived cells generated from three different
patients were screened with a spectrum of chemotherapies
and biological available compounds. A reduction of
≥ 40% of tumor cells was only demonstrated in selected
PDX derived cells as following: olaparib (pt. 99), cisplatin
(pt. 105) and selumetinib (pt. 87) (Figure 6E). Additionally,
a synergistic effect was observed with selumetinib and
ZSTK474 combination (pt. 87) (Figure 6F). Pleural
effusion from patient 87 (unstable genome) was obtained
following progression on third line treatment and a PDX
model was established from advanced clinical disease,
resistant to platinum (Figure 6A). No tumor attenuation was
demonstrated in vivo with PARPi (olaparib; 50 mg/kg/day)
treatment (n = 6) as compared to control (n = 6)
(Figure 6D). Additionally, chemo-resistance was observed
in vitro to PARPi, cisplatin and oxaliplatin (Figure 6E).

phenotype may have changed over the course of his
disease. In vivo and in vitro results from clinical resistant
disease demonstrate corresponding resistance to platinum/
PARPi agents. This suggests that alternative biomarkers
for identification of the relevant resistant clinical scenario
beyond WGS need to be developed. Transcriptome and
proteome data in advanced stages of disease may be more
informative for clinical decisions.
The advantage of utilizing ascites fluid and pleural
effusion cells relies on the noninvasive procedure and the
viability of these sources as it is routinely being performed
for patient’s clinical comfort. Additionally, these cells
recapitulate the most aggressive state of disease. Liver
core needle biopsies are usually being performed prior to
treatment initiation and therefore might not always reflect
the chemo resistant state of disease. Ideally, these models
and PDX from primary tumors should be generated and
tested in parallel.

The limitations of our model include the inability
to study tumor cell-host immune response interactions in
the immune-deficient mice background. In addition, the
cells identified and grown in the PDX model are captured
from the peritoneal cavity and pleural effusion and it is
necessary to further estimate to what extent they can
represent additional metastatic sites such as lung or liver
metastasis.
In summary, our results show remarkable similarity
of ascites/pleural effusion PDX to early stage PDAC. The
strength of our sample collection includes non-invasive
procedure, collecting tumor cells at advanced disease state,
allow the modelling of the refractory clinical scenario,
which is lacking in comparative models to date. These
models need to be further investigated at the transcriptome
and protein expression level and interrogated to identify
mechanisms of resistance that rapidly occurs in PDAC in
the clinical setting.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

The remaining fluids were used directly for generation of
PDAC PDX.
Data on patient demographics, clinical history,
surgery, systemic treatment, response to treatment and
BRCA 1/2 germ-line mutation status were collected from
the Sheba Medical Center cancer database and patient
records. Clinical stages were classiﬁed according to the
TNM AJCC staging system. Response to treatment was
categorized according to imaging results.

Ethic statement
Ascites and pleural effusion fluids were obtained
following approval of Sheba Medical Center institutional
ethics committee with consent from patients. Conduct
of the research project was approved by the Israeli
Ministry of Health and the study was performed with
strict accordance to animal use protocols approved by the
institutional animal care committee.

Cell lines
Human pancreatic carcinoma cell lines Panc1,
Capan1 and AsPC1 were used and authenticated by STR
profiling according to international cell line authentication
committee (ICLAC) (ANSI/ATCC ASN-0002-2011) and
mycoplasma free (EZ-polymerase chain reaction (PCR)
Mycoplasma test kit; Biological Industries). Cell were
cultured in full RPMI-1640 media. 3 × 106 cells were

nude-Foxn1nu immunodeficient mice (Harlan) for
xenograft establishment.

Tumor volume was followed bi-weekly by digital caliper
according to the formula (length × width2)/2 and tumor
growth kinetics curves were generated. Mice were weighted
twice weekly.
Mice were housed in specific pathogen-free
conditions, acclimatized to their new surroundings
for at least 48 hours prior to tumor engraftment, and
maintained in accordance with institutional standards.
Mice bearing 1.5 cm3 tumors were humanely sacrificed
using CO2 inhalation and tumor samples, liver, pancreas
and spleen were excised. Tumor samples were fixed in 4%
formaldehyde, digested into single cells for generation of
PDX-derived cell lines, cut into 2mm3 pieces and snap
frozen in liquid nitrogen and cryopreserved in fetal bovine
serum (FBS) with 10% DMSO.

PDAC patient derived xenograft model
Ascites fluid or pleural effusion were spun at
1200rpm for 10 minutes. Pellets were subcutaneously
injected into the flanks of 6–8 week old nude mice for
establishment of first generation (F1) xenograft (n = 1–2/
model). Tumors reaching maximum volume (1.5 cm3)
were harvested, cut into ~1–2 mm3 pieces and serially
transplanted to new recipient mice (n = 3–4). All PDXs
were successfully passaged at least twice to determine the
ability to perpetuate the models. Transplantations were
performed under anesthesia by intraperitoneal injection of
Ketamine (100 mg/kg) and Xylazine (10 mg/kg). Following
resection of the tumors, a 4 mm incision was used to
access the subcutaneous area of the sterilized anesthetized
recipient mice and a ~1–2 mm3 tumor piece was inserted.
Incisions were sutured by surgical clips (9 mm auto clips,
MikRon Precision Inc.) and animals were monitored for
signs of distress, wound dehiscence or signs of infection.

DASO M 0804), Muc1 (1:50; CM 290M-16), CEA (1:100;
Zymed 18-0013), TAG-72 (1:100; Cell marque CMC-897)
and the mesothelial marker calretinin (1:20; CM 232A-76).
Slides were reviewed and classified as malignant/nonmalignant according to cell morphology and immunostaining.
Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tumor sections were
stained with H&E and Masson’s trichome and immunostained
with human leucocyte antigen (HLA-A) (1:200; EP1395Y;
abcam 52922). All slides were reviewed by a pathologist
with expertise in PDAC and assessed for tumor architecture
and desmoplastic tumor response. Slides were classified
accordingly: 1. Differentiation (poorly; moderately and well
differentiated adenocarcinoma) 2. Stromal cellularity: i).
Inflammatory cellular stroma ii). Enriched collagen cell poor
stroma 3. Mucin production (yes/no) and 4. Necrosis (%).

(AZD2281) 8 ug, cisplatin 2 uM, oxaliplatin 1.2 uM, taxol
1 nM, gemcitabine 4 nM, etoposide 8 nM, selumetinib
(AZD6244) 0.5 uM, buparlisib (BKM120) 0.5 uM and
ZSTK474 0.5 uM. After 72 h, cells were fixed with 10%
trichloroacetic acid and stained with 0.057% SRB. The
absorbance was measured using microplate reader at 510
nm. Each concentration was tested in triplicate, and results
shown are representative of 3–4 independent experiments.

Doubling time
Each PDX-derived cell line was seeded (5x103 cells
per well) in six 96-well plates. The first plate was used as
the time zero plate. The remaining plates were incubated at
37°C and removed from the incubator every 24 h (24–120 h)
and SRB assay was performed. Growth curves were
plotted, and the doubling time was calculated. (Roth V.
2006 Doubling Time Computing, Available from: http://
www.doubling-time.com/compute.php).

Short tandem repeat (STR) profiling
Genomic DNA was extracted using the Qiagen DNA
Easy Blood and Tissue Kit (Cat #69506) and was genotyped
for 15 Autosomal STR loci and Amelogenin (X/Y) using
Promega Power Plex16HS PCR kit (Cat#DC2101). STR
analyzes was assigned using Soft Genetics, Gene Marker
Software Version 1.85. Alleles were matched to STR profile
of matching germline DNA for PDX and ATCC for cell
lines. A minimum of 80% match threshold was used to
indicate a shared genetic history (ANSI/ATCC ASN-00022011. Authentication of Human Cell Lines: Standardization
of STR Profiling. ANSI eStandards Store, 2012. Cell line
authentication was provided by Elizabeth Cox and the team at
University of Arizona Genetics Core (via Science Exchange).

Therapeutic evaluation in vivo
All animal studies were approved by the Sheba
Medical Center Institutional Animal Care and Use
Committee (Helsinki 930/14). Preserved frozen tumors
from PDX 87 were thawed and implanted to a group of
animals. When tumors reached palpable size (~100 mm3),
mice were randomized into the following treatment
groups (n = 6/group): (a) PARPi (Olaparib, Selleckchem)
dissolved in 10% Hydroxypropyl-β-Cyclodextrin (Sigma),
50 mg/kg, intra-peritoneal (I.P.) (b) Vehicle control (10%
Hydroxypropyl-β-Cyclodextrinl; IP); five days a week for
four weeks.
Tumor volumes were measured twice a week using a
caliper according to the formula (length × width2/2). Mice
were weighted twice a week. Mice were euthanized if the
tumor burden reached 1.5 cm3 or the animals presented
over 20% of the initial body weight loss. At the end of the
experiments, animals were sacrificed by CO2 inhalation.
Tumor growth curves are presented as average relative
tumor volume (RTV) ± SE at each measurement point, for
each treatment group.

Ascites/pleural effusion PDX digestion and
in-vitro experimental design
Tumor digestion and generation of PDX-derived cell
lines: F3-F4 generation PDXs were minced into singlecells by enzymatic digestion with 0.2% collagenase
type-I (Sigma Aldrich) for 2 h in 37°C. The cells were
then strained through a 70 uM nylon mesh, washed and
cultured in full RPMI medium. Short trypsinization was
performed in order to isolate tumor cells from mouse
stromal cells. The less adherent mouse stromal cells were
washed and remaining epithelial cells were re-cultured in
complete media. The procedure was performed several
times until a pure epithelial population was obtained.

Metastatic PDX model
Lentiviral vector production
High titer lentiviral vector stock was produced in
human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293T cells following
transient transfection with the vector pCCL.sin.cPPT.polyA.
CTE.eGFP.minhCMV.hPGK.Luciferase.Wprep (10 µg).
Lipofectamine 2000 was used for transfection and the
plasmid was a kind gift from Prof.Carola Ponzetto
(CeRMS University, Turin, Italy). The following packaging
vectors were used: pMDLg/pRRE (5 µg), pRSV-REV
(2.5 µg) and pMD2.VSVG (5 µg). Supernatants were
harvested after 32 h, filtered through 0.22 µm pore size

Room temperature
Sulforhodamine B (SRB) cytotoxicity assays
SRB assays were performed as previously described
[35]. In brief, PDX-derived cells and established cell lines
were seeded at a density of 5 × 103 cells/well in 96 well
plates in complete medium. The following day cells were
treated with therapeutic agents and combinations: olaparib

filters (Millipore, Billerica, MA) and used directly for
subsequent target cell infection. PDX 87 and PDX 99
derived cells (1 × 105 ) were plated 16 hours beforehand
(in 35-mm diameter culture dishes) and were transduced
by the above described viruses to obtain PDX 87/GFP-Luc
and PDX 99/GFP-Luc cells. The medium was changed
16 hours post infection and cells were kept in culture
for 48 h before flow cytometry sorting of GFP positive
cells. Luciferase activity from the same PDX cells was
measured by bioluminescence imaging and confirmed
with cell lysates luciferase assay. In sequential noninvasive
imaging, attached PDX cells were exposed to 15 mg/mL of
luciferin directly supplemented in the serum free medium
and detected with a cooled charge-coupled device (CCD)
bioluminescence camera (In Vivo Imaging System, IVIS
50; Xenogen, Alameda, CA) immediately. Photon emission
was acquired for 120 seconds and bioluminescence was
quantified using Living Image software (Xenogen Corp.,
Alameda, CA).To confirm the results, ex vivo luciferase
activity of both PDX clones was tested by the Dual
Luciferase Assay kit purchased from Promega (Madison,
WI). Cells (4 × 105) were extracted with lysis solution and
50 µl of cell suspension was added to 100 µl of luciferin
mix. The luciferase activity was measured by a VictorX
luminometer.Lentiviral vector production

fragments using the Covaris S2 Ultra-sonicator (Covaris
Inc., Woburn, MA, USA) followed by 1x volume AMPure
XP SPRI bead clean-up (Beckman Coulter Genomics,
Danvers, MA, USA Cat#A63881). Libraries were
constructed using enzymatic reagents from KAPA Hyper
Library Preparation Kits (KAPA Biosystems, Woburn,
MA USA Cat# KK8505) according to protocols described
by Fisher, et al. [36] for end repair, A-tailing, and adapter
ligation using NextFlex DNA barcodes (Bioo Scientific,
Austin TX, 78744, Cat #514104). Adapter- ligated libraries
were enriched using optimized PCR conditions by adding
6 μL of Illumina paired-end enrichment primers (Integrated
DNA Technologies, Coralville, Iowa, USA), 75 μL of
2× KAPA HiFi HotStart ReadyMix (KAPA Biosystems,
Woburn, MA, USA Cat#KK2602) and 33 μL of nucleasefree water (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA
Cat#AM993) to 36 μL of eluted DNA and amplified across
3 individual PCR reaction tubes. Libraries were incubated
in Verti 96-well Thermal Cyclers (Life Technologies,
Carlsbad, CA, USA) for 45s at 98°C and cycled 9 times
for 15s at 98°C, 30s at 65°C, and 30s at 72°C. Following a
0.6x SPRI bead clean-up, post-PCR enriched libraries were
eluted in 25 uL of elution buffer (Qiagen, Hilden Germany,
Cat#19086) and validated using Agilent TapeStation High
Sensitivity DNA Kit (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara,
CA, USA Cat#5067-5584, 5067-5585).
Libraries were quantified on the Illumina Eco RealTime PCR Instrument (Illumina Inc., San Diego, CA, USA)
using KAPA Illumina Library Quantification Kits (KAPA
Biosciences, Woburn, MA, USA Cat#KK4835) according
to the manufacturer’s standard protocol. Paired-end cluster
generation and sequencing was carried out for all libraries
on the Illumina HiSeq 2500 platform using high-throughput
2X126 cycles (Illumina Inc., San Diego, CA, USA Cat
#PE-401-4001/FC- 401-4001). Samples were sequenced
to a minimum collapsed coverage of 35x× and 30× for
xenograft and matched normal samples, respectively.
Once sequencing was complete, Xenome v1.01-r
was used to identify and remove mouse reads. Human
reads and ambiguous reads were aligned to hg19_
random using BWA v0.6.2. Lanes were merged and PCR
duplicates were flagged using Picard v1.90.
Somatic SNVs and INDELs were identified by
comparing the xenograft and matched normal genomes
using Strelka v1.07 and MuTect v1.1.4 and annotated
with dbSNP 142, COSMIC v54, ANNOVAR v201306-21 and FunSeq v0.1. In order to increase precision,
only SNVs that were called by both Strelka and MuTect
were considered [37]. A blacklist consisting of SNVs and
INDELs generated by aligning model mouse DNA to
hg19_random was used to remove potential false positives
caused by unfiltered mouse DNA.
Neo-antigen load was estimated by predicting the
binding affinity between the HLA types derived from the
matched normal sequencing with the peptides that result
from the non-silent somatic variants observed in the

Animal model
All animal studies were approved by the Weizmann
Institute’s Animal Care and Use Committee. PDX 87/GFPLuc and PDX 99/GFP-Luc derived cells (3.5 × 106 /100 ul)
were injected to tail vein of female 4 week old NOG mice
(Jackson Laboratory, USA). Mice were monitored twice
weekly for the evidence of morbidity related to pulmonary
metastases.

Metastasis test in animals
IVIS (Xenogen Corp., Alameda, CA) consists of
a highly sensitive, charge-coupled digital camera that
captures photons of light emitted by cells that have been
engineered to produce bioluminescence in the living animal.
The substrate luciferin was injected into the intraperitoneal
cavity at a dose of 150 mg/kg body weight (15 mg/ml
luciferin), approximately 5 minutes before imaging. Mice
were anesthetized with isoflurane/oxygen and placed
on the imaging stage. Ventral images were collected for
30–60 seconds using the IVIS and quantified using Living
Image software (Xenogen Corp., Alameda, CA). To check
micrometastasis in lung, liver, spleen and pancreas were
removed and washed, and images were acquired using a
fluorescent binocular microscope (Olympus, USA).

Whole genome sequencing of PDXs
50ng of Qubit (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA,
Cat #Q32854) quantified gDNA was sheared to 550 bp

tumor. POLYSOLVER v1.0 was used to determine HLA
types. A perl-script was used to convert non-silent SNVs
and INDELs to peptides with 9 amino acids. The binding
affinity between the HLA types and peptides was predicted
using NetMHC pan-2.8; any peptide with a binding
affinity of < 500 Nm was considered to be a neo-antigen.
GATK v1.3.16 was used to realign, recalibrate and
genotype the matched normal DNA by following the
best practice guidelines made available by the Broad.
Germline SNVs and INDELs were annotated with
dbSNP 142, COSMIC v54, ANNOVAR v2013-06-21
and FunSeq v0.1.
Somatic structural variants (SVs) were called
by applying CREST vAlpha and DELLY v0.5.5 to the
xenograft and matched normal genomes. The output of
each tool was filtered to remove false positives and the
resulting lists of variants were merged. Somatic copy
number variants (CNVs) were called by HMMCopy v0.1.1.
