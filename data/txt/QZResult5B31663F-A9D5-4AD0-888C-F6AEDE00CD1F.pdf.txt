Abstract
Cholesterol metabolism is particularly active in malignant,
proliferative cells, whereas cholesterol starvation has been
shown to inhibit cell proliferation. Inhibition of enzymes
involved in cholesterol biosynthesis at steps before the
formation of 7-dehydrocholesterol has been shown to selectively
affect cell cycle progression from G2 phase in human promyelocytic HL-60 cells. In the present work, we explored whether
cholesterol starvation by culture in cholesterol-free medium
and treatment with different distal cholesterol biosynthesis
inhibitors induces differentiation of HL-60 cells. Treatment
with SKF 104976, an inhibitor of lanosterol 14-A demethylase,
or with zaragozic acid, which inhibits squalene synthase,
caused morphologic changes alongside respiratory burst
activity and expression of cluster of differentiation antigen 11c
(CD11c) but not cluster of differentiation antigen 14. These
effects were comparable to those produced by all-trans retinoic
acid, which induces HL-60 cells to differentiate following
a granulocyte lineage. In contrast, they differed from those
produced by vitamin D3, which promotes monocyte differentiation. The specificity of the response was confirmed by addition
of cholesterol to the culture medium. Treatment with PD 98059,
an inhibitor of extracellular signal–regulated kinase, abolished
both the activation of NADPH oxidase and the expression of
the CD11c marker. In sharp contrast, BM 15766, which inhibits sterol #7-reductase, failed to induce differentiation
or arrest cell proliferation. These results show that changes in
the sterol composition may trigger a differentiation response
and highlight the potential of cholesterol pathway inhibition
as a possible tool for use in cancer therapy. [Cancer Res

Introduction
Cholesterol homeostasis is abnormal in malignant cells. Freshly
isolated acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and chronic myelogenous
leukemia cells display much higher specific low-density lipoprotein
uptake and degradation (1–3) and hydroxymethylglutaryl
(HMG)-CoA reductase activity (2) than leukocytes from healthy
subjects. A recent study by Banker et al. (4) reported that the levels
of mRNAs for the low-density lipoprotein receptor and 3-hydroxy3-methylglutaryl CoA reductase (HMG-CoA reductase) are in-

creased by daunorubicin or cytarabine treatment in almost all
cultured AML samples, an effect which may increase leukemia cell
survival and impart relative resistance to therapy.
Statins, which block cholesterol biosynthesis through competitive inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase, the rate-limiting enzyme in
the pathway, have been shown to inhibit cell proliferation and to
have several effects that are of interest in relation to cancer
prevention, including effects on cell differentiation (5, 6). However,
the effects of inhibiting cholesterol biosynthesis are dependent on
the model used. In both neuroblastoma cells (7) and AML cells (8),
lovastatin induces widespread differentiation followed by extensive
apoptosis. In human malignant glioma cell lines and untransformed rat astrocytes, lovastatin also causes effective apoptosis but
does not induce differentiation (9). Treatment with statins has
been also shown to sensitize AML cells to radiochemotherapy,
suggesting that cellular cholesterol is critical for cell survival (10).
Acute lymphoid leukemias, however, seem to be resistant to statins
(11). Phenylacetate, an inhibitor of mevalonate-5-pyrophosphate
decarboxylase, has also been reported to inhibit cell growth in a
variety of cell lines but data on its effects on cell differentiation are
inconclusive (9, 12).
Administration of relatively high doses of statins to rodents has
been shown to reduce the growth of various types of tumor (13, 14).
Some retrospective studies of patients receiving statins as lipidlowering drugs for the prevention of cardiac events showed a slight
reduction in the incidence of breast cancer (15) and colorectal
cancer (16). However, some other clinical studies (17–19) and two
recent meta-analyses (20, 21) found no evidence that the use of
statins reduces the risk of cancer. A recent phase II trial also failed to
reveal any relevant activity of phenylacetate against malignant
glioma (22).
Both statins and phenylacetate act very early in the cholesterol
pathway, inhibiting the synthesis of both sterols and nonsterol
mevalonate derivatives. These different mevalonate derivatives
exert many distinct biological actions, with important physiologic
implications. Cholesterol is used for membrane formation and is a
principal component of lipid rafts and caveolae, in which many
receptors for extracellular signals reside (23). Nonsterol isoprenoids are precursors of ubiquinone and heme A and are used for
protein prenylation, which allows certain proteins to localize to
membranes where they exert specific functions (24). Thus, it is not
surprising that blockade of their synthesis results in the alteration
of multiple processes. Furthermore, differences in the sensitivity to
these inhibitors and/or the demand for nonsterol isoprenoid
derivatives among cell types may explain the variability of the
results obtained. The profound consequences of these various
effects are highlighted in the results of previous studies from our
laboratory showing that different inhibitors of cholesterol biosynthesis, acting on distinct enzymes, have different effects on cell
cycle progression (25–28).

Promyelocytic HL-60 cells represent a useful model in which to
study myeloid cell differentiation. Treatment with all-trans retinoic
acid (RA) or DMSO has been shown to cause HL-60 to differentiate
into granulocytes (29). In contrast, treatment with vitamin D3
induces differentiation into monocytes (30).
Exposure of HL-60 cells to agents that cause granulocyte
differentiation is accompanied by a rapid decrease in sterol
synthesis, whereas this effect is not observed with factors that
cause monocyte or macrophage differentiation (31, 32). This is
consistent with the observation that peripheral blood granulocytes
almost entirely lack the ability to synthesize post-squalene
products, whereas monocytes posses an active cholesterol
biosynthesis pathway (32). However, it is unclear whether
cholesterol biosynthesis is directly involved in myeloid differentiation.
In this study, we examined the effects of cholesterol starvation
on differentiation of HL-60 cells. We found that distal inhibition of
cholesterol biosynthesis by treatment with either SKF 104976, an
inhibitor of lanosterol 14-a demethylase, or zaragozic acid, an
inhibitor of squalene synthase, specifically induces respiratory
burst activity and the expression of cluster of differentiation
antigen 11c (CD11c) but not cluster of differentiation antigen 14
(CD14). These effects were mediated by the mitogen-activated
protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. In contrast, BM 15766, which
inhibits sterol D7-reductase, failed to induce differentiation. Our
results show that changes in sterol composition may trigger a
differentiation response and highlight the potential of cholesterol
pathway inhibition as a possible tool in cancer therapy.

15766 were dissolved in DMSO. All-trans RA and cholesterol were dissolved
in ethanol. Stock solutions were stored at 20jC.
Cells and cell culture. HL-60 (ECACC 98070106) cells were obtained
from the European Collection of Cell Cultures (Salisbury, United Kingdom)
and cultured at 37jC in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2. Cells

were cultured in cholesterol-free medium containing insulin, transferrin,
and selenium supplements: RPMI 1640 (Life Technologies) supplemented
with 625 Ag/mL transferrin (Roche, Basel, Switzerland), 625 Ag/mL insulin,
535 Ag/mL linoleic acid-bovine serum albumin, 625 ng/mL sodium selenite
(Sigma), 125 mg/mL human serum albumin (Grifols 20%, Barcelona, Spain),
and antibiotics (100 units/mL penicillin, 100 Ag/mL streptomycin, and
10 Ag/mL gentamicin). Cells were subcultured two to three times weekly to
maintain logarithmic growth. Viable cells, characterized by trypan blue
exclusion, were counted with a Neubauer hemocytometer.
Cells (2  105/mL) in exponential growth phase were suspended in fresh
medium and treated with the different compounds dissolved as indicated
above. The final concentration of DMSO and ethanol in the medium was
0.044% and 0.44% (v/v), respectively, in both control and experimental
conditions. All experiments were repeated at least thrice.
Morphologic studies. Cell morphology was examined by microscopy
using the May Grünwalds-Giemsa stain according to manufacturer’s
instructions (Merck Diagnostica, Darmstadt, Germany). Cells were centrifuged onto glass slides in a Shandon Cytospin 3 at 750 rpm for 3 min. The
slides were then dried, stained, and examined at 400 magnification using
an Olympus BX51 light microscope fitted with a JVC 3-CCD digital color
video camera.
NADPH oxidase activity. The respiratory burst was detected by oxidation
of the fluorescent probe CM-H2DCFDA, as described elsewhere (33). Cells
(5  105) were harvested by centrifugation at 1,500 rpm for 5 min, washed with
PBS, and resuspended in 100 AL of fresh culture medium. Then, the cells were
incubated for 2 h with 10 Amol/L CM-H2DCFDA and 100 ng/mL PMA
(activated) or PBS (resting) at 37jC in the dark. Fresh culture medium (400 AL)
was added before acquisition with a FACSCalibur flow cytometer (Becton
Dickinson, San Jose, CA). Data were analyzed with the WinMDI 2.8 software
(Build #13 01-19-2000, Copyright Joseph Trotter).
CD marker expression. To detect cell-surface markers by flow
cytometry, 5  105 cells were harvested by centrifugation at 1,500 rpm
for 5 min, washed with PBS, and resuspended in 100 AL of fresh culture
medium. Then, cells were incubated for 15 min in the dark at room
temperature with 10 AL of phycoerythrin-labeled CD14 and 5 AL of
allophycocyanin-labeled CD11c antibodies. The cells were washed twice
with PBS and resuspended in 0.5 mL of 1% paraformaldehyde, then
analyzed by flow cytometry. For each sample, separate aliquots of cells were
treated with PBS instead of antibodies to determine the fluorescence
relative to unlabeled controls.
Western blotting. For Western blot analysis, 4  106 to 8  106 cells
were harvested and washed twice with ice-cold PBS, and whole-cell extracts
were prepared by mixing the cell pellets with an extraction buffer
[50 mmol/L Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 125 mmol/L NaCl, 1% NP40, 0.225 mg/mL
NaF,0.626mg/mLNa4P2O7,1mmol/LNa3VO4,10%glycerol,1mmol/LNa2EDTA,
Na2EDTA, and 5 AL/mL Calbiochem Proteases Inhibitor Cocktail Set III].
Equal amounts of extracts (40 Ag of protein) were separated by SDS-PAGE
(12% polyacrylamide gel containing SDS) and transferred to polyvinylidene
difluoride membranes (Hybond-P, Amersham Biosciences). The membranes
were blocked with 5% nonfat dried milk in TBS containing 0.05% Tween
20 (TBS-T) and then blotted overnight at 4jC with mouse monoclonal anti–
diphospho-ERK (1:2,000 dilution), mouse monoclonal anti-p47phox antibody
(1:500 dilution), and mouse anti-p67phox antibody (1:500 dilution) in TBS-T
and 1% nonfat dried milk. Then, the membranes were washed thrice with
TBS-T and incubated for 1 h with a peroxidase-conjugated donkey antimouse antibody (1:2,000 dilution) in TBS-T and 1% nonfat dried milk. The
membranes were washed and the protein bands were detected with a
chemiluminescence assay system (ECL Western Blotting Analysis system,
Amersham Biosciences) and visualized with the VersaDoc Model 4000
Imaging System (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) using Quantity One 4.5.2 1D
Imaging Software. The blots were stripped for 30 min at 50jC with a
stripping buffer [100 mmol/L 2-mercaptoethanol, 2% SDS, 62.5 mmol/L
Tris-HCl (pH 6.7)] and reprobed with rabbit polyclonal anti-ERK antibody
(1:5,000 dilution) or finally with a rabbit polyclonal anti-GAPDH antibody
(1:5,000 dilution).
Analysis of cell sterol content. HL-60 cells (7.5  106) were incubated
in the absence (control) or presence of the different inhibitors for 72 h and

then washed with ice-cold PBS and resuspended in 0.5 mL of 10% (w/v)
KOH. 3H-Cholesterol was added as an internal standard. The samples were
treated sequentially with chloroform-methanol (2:1, v/v) and distilled water
to obtain the lipid and water-soluble fractions. Then, the nonsaponifiable
fractions were obtained and used for sterol separation by reverse-phase
high-performance liquid chromatography as described elsewhere (25, 34).
Statistical analysis. All experiments were done at least thrice. Data are
shown as mean F SE. Effects of the different treatments were analyzed by
one-way ANOVA and post hoc multiple comparisons were done with
Tukey’s test. Calculations were done using Statgraphics Plus v5.0 software
(Statistical Graphics, Herndon, VA).

Results
Induction of oxidative burst via inhibition of lanosterol
demethylase. To reduce the cell cholesterol content, HL-60 cells
were incubated in a defined medium lacking cholesterol and were
treated with SKF 104976, a specific inhibitor of lanosterol 14-a
demethylase. This treatment led to a marked decrease in
cholesterol content (1.18 F 0.1 versus 6.01 F 0.4 Ag/mg of cell
protein in treated and control cells, respectively). NADPH oxidase
activity was analyzed as a functional marker of differentiation in
human myeloid cells lines. Cells were stimulated with PMA to
activate NADPH oxidase and incubated in the presence of CMH2DCFDA. CM-H2DCFDA passively diffuses into cells and,
following cleavage of acetate groups by intracellular esterases,
oxidation by superoxide anion/hydrogen peroxide yields a

fluorescent adduct that is trapped inside the cell, facilitating its
detection by flow cytometry (33, 35). Cells treated for 5 days with
1 Amol/L RA or 1 Amol/L D3, which cause differentiation of HL-60
cells to granulocytes and monocytes, respectively, were used as
positive controls. Differentiation induced by any of the agents
resulted in intense CM-H2DCFDA oxidation when compared with
undifferentiated cells (Fig. 1A). Treatment with SKF 104976 also
increased respiratory burst activity in a time- and dose-dependent
manner. The maximum effect was achieved with 1.5 Amol/L SKF
104976 at 4 days; under those conditions, the mean fluorescence
was even higher than with either RA or D3 (Fig. 1B and C).
Expression of the regulatory subunits of NADPH oxidase,
p47phox and p67phox, was analyzed by Western blot. As shown in
Fig. 1D, the proteins were barely detected in undifferentiated HL60 and their expression rapidly increased as a result of treatment
with 1.5 Amol/L SKF 104976.
Morphology and CD marker expression in HL-60 cells
treated with SKF 104976. The morphology of HL-60 cells treated
with SKF 104976 compared with control cells and cells induced to
differentiate with D3 or RA is shown in Fig. 2A. Undifferentiated
HL-60 cells were round and had unsegmented nuclei that occupied
>75% of the cross-sectional area of the cell. RA-treated cells had
bilobed and segmented nuclei, comparable to those found in
metamyelocytes and banded neutrophils, and were relatively
regular in shape. D3-treated cells had a reduced nucleus-tocytoplasm ratio. Moreover, the nuclei assumed the reniform

appearance typical of monocytes. Preparations of cells treated with
1.5 Amol/L SKF 104976 for 3 or 5 days were more heterogeneous.
A subset of cells were binucleated whereas those cells that were
mononucleated were smaller than the undifferentiated, control
cells. Moreover, some cells were multinucleated and mitotic
aberrations were observed.
Expression of CD11c and CD14 on the cell surface is also shown
in Fig. 1. As expected, most of the undifferentiated HL-60 cells did
not express any of these antigens. In contrast, most of the cells
induced to differentiate to granulocytes with RA expressed CD11c,
whereas those that differentiated to monocytes using D3 expressed
both CD11c and, characteristically, CD14 (Fig. 2B). These results
are consistent with those of previous reports (36, 37). Treatment
with 1.5 Amol/L SKF 104976 was accompanied by a progressive
increase in the proportion of cells expressing CD11c, which
accounted for f60% of the total at day 4 of treatment (Fig. 2C).
This effect of SKF 104976 on CD11c expression was dose
dependent (Fig. 2D). In contrast, treatment with SKF 104976 did
not produce any detectable change in CD14 expression (Fig. 2C
and D).
Prevention of SKF 104976–induced cell differentiation by
cholesterol. Having shown that cholesterol starvation induced
HL-60 cell differentiation, we analyzed the specificity of this effect

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (7). April 1, 2007

by supplementing the medium with free cholesterol (Table 1). In
control cells, supplementing the medium with 90 Ag/mL
cholesterol had no apparent effect on respiratory burst activity
or cell-surface CD expression. Simultaneous addition of cholesterol
and 1.5 Amol/L SKF 104976 for 3 days practically abrogated the
effects of the cholesterol biosynthesis inhibitor alone on both cellsurface expression of CD11c and respiratory burst activity. These
results show that cholesterol deficiency specifically induces
differentiation of human promyelocytic HL-60 cells.
Effects of other inhibitors of cholesterol biosynthesis on
differentiation of HL-60 cells. Zaragozic acid is a potent inhibitor
of squalene synthase (38). Treatment of HL-60 cells with 60 Amol/L
zaragozic acid for 3 days resulted in a notable reduction of the cell
cholesterol content (1.46 F 0.2 versus 6.01 F 0.4 Ag/mg of cell
protein in treated and control cells, respectively). As recently
shown in our laboratory, this treatment leads to inhibition of cell
proliferation and cell cycle arrest at G2-M phase, similarly to SKF
104976 (27). We therefore assessed whether cell deprivation of any
sterol is a stimulus for HL-60 cell differentiation.
Treatment of HL-60 cells with zaragozic acid in medium lacking
cholesterol resulted in stimulation of respiratory burst in a timeand dose-dependent fashion (Fig. 3A and B, respectively) and
induced cell-surface expression of CD11c but not CD14 (Fig. 3C).

incorporation into cholesterol, with a reduction in cell cholesterol
content but an accumulation of 7-dehydrocholesterol (27). In the
present study, treatment of HL-60 cells with BM 15766 for up to 5
days did not result in any appreciable increase in respiratory burst
activity or the expression of CD markers (data not shown).
The ERK pathway is required for differentiation of HL-60
cells induced by cholesterol starvation. The ERK pathway is
known to be involved in myeloid cell differentiation (39). Analysis
of ERK protein expression in HL-60 cells revealed that treatment
with SKF 104976 was accompanied by a rapid and marked increase
in the cell levels of phosphorylated ERK without apparent changes
in total ERK (Fig. 5A). To ascertain whether the ERK pathway is
involved in cell differentiation induced by cholesterol starvation,
HL-60 cells were treated with increasing concentrations of SKF
104976 and 30 Amol/L PD 98059, a specific inhibitor of MAPK/ERK
kinase (MEK). As shown in Fig. 5B, PD 98059 totally prevented the
expression of CD11c. This finding indicates that active ERK is
required for differentiation induced by SKF 104976.

Discussion
A gradual induction of p47phox and p67phox proteins was observed
in cells treated with zaragozic acid (Fig. 3D). The effects closely
resembled those of SKF 104976. Moreover, the effects of zaragozic
acid on both oxidative activity (Fig. 4A) and expression of CD11c
(Fig. 4B) were prevented by simultaneous addition of free
cholesterol to the incubation medium. These results indicate that
the effects of zaragozic acid are due to the cholesterol deficiency it
produces.
We then analyzed the effects of other more distal inhibitors of
the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway. BM 15766 is a competitive
inhibitor of sterol D7-reductase, and treatment of HL-60 cells with
25 Amol/L BM 15766 has been shown to block [14C]acetate

Induction of a differentiation response in malignant cells can
have positive clinical implications, such as the loss of proliferative
potential and the induction of apoptosis (8, 11). In previous
studies, we showed that inhibition of cholesterol biosynthesis in
HL-60 cells resulted in the arrest of cell cycle progression (25–28).
In this study, we have shown that inhibition of cholesterol
biosynthesis induces differentiation in promyelocytic HL-60 cells,
as indicated by morphologic changes, gradual induction of p47phox
and p67phox protein expression, increased NADPH oxidase activity,
and the expression of specific cell-surface markers.
To deprive cells of cholesterol, they were incubated in a
cholesterol-free medium and treated with zaragozic acid, SKF
104976, or BM 15766, which inhibit squalene synthase, lanosterol

14-a-demethylase, and sterol D7-reductase, respectively. These
inhibitors caused a reduction in cell cholesterol content that was
accompanied by accumulation of the substrates of the respective
target enzymes: lanosterol and dihydrolanosterol in cells treated
with SKF 104976 and 7-dehydrocholesterol in cells treated with
BM 15766; no intermediate sterol accumulated in cells treated
with zaragozic acid (27). Treatment with SKF 104976 or zaragozic
acid induced extensive differentiation of HL-60 cells. In both
cases, this effect was specific because it was prevented by adding
cholesterol to the incubation medium. In sharp contrast, cells
treated with BM 15766 did not show any signs of differentiation.
These findings correlated with the differential action of these

cholesterol biosynthesis inhibitors on cell growth: SKF 104976 and
zaragozic acid have been reported to arrest cell cycle progression
and cell growth, whereas BM 15766 was ineffective (27). In light of
the requirement for cholesterol during cytokinesis (40, 41), these
results indicate that 7-dehydrocholesterol, which accumulates in
BM 15766-treated cells, may substitute cholesterol for cell division,
whereas lanosterol and dihydrolanosterol, which accumulate in
cells treated with SKF 104976, may not (27). The similarity
between the effects of cholesterol biosynthesis inhibition on cell
proliferation and cell differentiation is consistent with the
suggestion that these two processes are regulated simultaneously
(42, 43).

Cholesterol Starvation Induces Cell Differentiation

The differentiation program induced by cholesterol starvation
differs from that induced by either RA or D3. Cells treated with SKF
104976 were morphologically heterogeneous; binucleated cells
were abundant and many of them showed evidence of abnormal
mitosis. In addition, the mononucleated cells present in SKF
104976–treated preparations were smaller than control, undifferentiated cells. This complex phenotype contrasted with those
achieved with RA (bilobed and segmented nuclei characteristic of
neutrophils) or D3 (reniform nuclei typical of monocytes). Cells
treated with SKF 104976 or zaragozic acid showed increased
expression of the CD11c antigen, an a-integrin chain known to be
strongly up-regulated during myeloid differentiation (36, 37). The
lipopolysaccharide receptor CD14, however, was not expressed in
cholesterol-deprived cells, indicating that monocyte differentiation
did not occur.
Analysis of the effects of inhibiting the mevalonate pathway on
differentiation has shown that treatment with statins induces a
granulocyte-type differentiation in AML but not ALL cells, as
indicated by morphologic changes and increased expression of
CD11b or cluster of differentiation antigen 18 (CD18; ref. 8). In
keratinocytes, cholesterol depletion by treatment with a combination of lovastatin and methyl-h-cyclodextrin produced a strong upregulation of mRNA for involucrin, a marker of epidermal
differentiation (44). On the other hand, patients with acute
leukemia, especially those with monocytic or myelomonocytic
leukemia, frequently display hypocholesterolemia in association
with increased low-density lipoprotein receptor activity in
malignant cells (45). This effect is presumably due to the increased
demand for cholesterol associated with cell proliferation (46).
Taken together, those results suggest that blocking cholesterol
provision by inhibition of cholesterol biosynthesis may be of

interest as a cancer therapy due to its effects on both cell
proliferation and differentiation.
The MEK/ERK/MAPK signaling pathway has been shown to play
a critical role during both monocyte and granulocyte differentiation of HL-60 cells stimulated with PMA and RA, respectively (39).
In this study, we have shown that treatment of HL-60 cells with
SKF 104976 or zaragozic acid produces sustained activation of
ERK1/2 and that coincubation with PD 98059 abrogated differentiation. This pathway is also known to be required for neuronal
differentiation in rat PC12 cells (47), maturation of thymocytes
from CD4 CD8 to CD4+CD8+ cells (48), and adipogenesis (49).
Taken together, these results firmly indicate the universal role of
the MEK/ERK/MAPK signaling pathway in cell differentiation.
In summary, the results of this study indicate that cholesterol
starvation may lead to myeloid differentiation. Furthermore, our
observation of distinct responses to different cholesterol
biosynthesis inhibitors that reduce the cell cholesterol content
to a similar extent suggests that differentiation is triggered by
specific changes in the sterol composition of the cell. Thus,
modulation of the expression of the different enzymes involved
in cholesterol biosynthesis may have a role in the differentiation
process.
