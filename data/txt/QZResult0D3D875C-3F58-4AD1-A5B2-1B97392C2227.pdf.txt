BACKGROUND. Breast cancer recurrence is associated with significant morbidity, mortality, and cost. Patients with
early stage HER2þ tumors are at increased risk of recurrence. The use of trastuzumab for these patients has been
shown to reduce recurrences and improve overall survival. METHODS. A Monte Carlo simulation was conducted
based on Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results incidence rates for 2005, United States Census data for 2005,
and the results of key trials of the adjuvant use of trastuzumab. Patients included in this analysis had incident,
HER2þ, stage I to III breast cancer. The number of recurrences that could be prevented with trastuzumab, the cardiac
adverse events that might occur, and the associated cost savings were estimated. RESULTS. Approximately 31,200
women had HER2þ breast cancer in 2005, of whom 7298 would have had a recurrence over the subsequent 5 years
despite standard of care adjuvant treatment. If trastuzumab were added to their regimen, 2791 women might have
avoided recurrence, and 948 may have had an asymptomatic or symptomatic cardiac adverse event, for a ratio of
expected recurrences to cardiac adverse events of 3.2 (95% confidence interval, 1.5-5.9). In economic terms, avoidance of future breast cancer recurrences was associated with lifetime reduction in future direct and indirect costs on
the order of $240 million to $1.7 billion. CONCLUSIONS. On the basis of the simulation results, targeting HER2þ
tumors with trastuzumab in the adjuvant setting should prevent a significant number of women from recurrence

Recurrences of breast cancer are associated with significant morbidity, mortality, and cost.1 Women with
HER2þ tumors are at higher risk of recurrence than other women, suggesting that the clinical and economic burden is
even higher in this subgroup of cancer patients.2-4 Trastuzumab (Herceptin, Genentech, Inc., South San Francisco, Calif)
has been shown in multiple studies to reduce recurrences in women with stage I to III HERþ breast cancer who have been
appropriately diagnosed and treated.5-7 In addition to demonstrated clinical efficacy, several cost-effectiveness analyses of
trastuzumab in the adjuvant setting have found its use to represent an economically attractive value proposition, according
to commonly accepted standards.8-12 Taken together, these reports address the important issues of safety, efficacy, and
value, however, none of them evaluates the impact on the US population of introducing this new therapeutic option in
terms of either the recurrences prevented or the potential associated cost savings.
The purpose of this research was to estimate the annual number of patients in whom recurrence events (local recurrences, distant recurrences, contralateral tumors, and deaths) might be prevented. Typically, the concept of extrapolating
results to a population has been focused on understanding risk factors for disease and the effect that eliminating the risk
might have on the population. This concept of measuring attributable risk or etiologic fraction has been well documented,
albeit the subject of some debate because of the variety of measures and interpretations.13
In this research, we are evaluating the benefit of a beneficial exposure (treatment), rather than the risk, and we are
doing so using Monte Carlo simulation techniques rather than the results of any single study.14 Furthermore, we address
not only the primary benefit of treatment, but also the primary risk, cardiac adverse events. Finally, we explore the economic impact of prevented recurrence events to society.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
HER21 Breast Cancer Incidence
The Monte Carlo model uses data from the Surveillance,
Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) program as the
basis for the simulation, with crude rates and confidence
intervals obtained using SEERStat software version
6.4.4.15 Women aged 30 years and older with stage I to
III breast cancer were included from the 17 available registries for 2005. The results were stratified by age (30-49,
50-69, and 70þ), estrogen receptor (ER) status, progesterone receptor (PR) status, and nodal involvement
(0 nodes vs > 0 nodes).
We assumed that patients with missing ER, PR, or
nodal status would not be HER2 tested and are excluded
from our rate estimates (7%-9% of patients, depending
on age). Excluding these patients also minimizes the number of patients who either were diagnosed at autopsy or
died very quickly after diagnosis and could not be tested.
Furthermore, the model excludes both recurrent patients
and incident metastatic patients.
HER2 status

Because HER2 status is not available in SEER, the
number of HER2þ patients was estimated as a proportion of the total population within each of the 4 mutually
exclusive strata defined by ER and PR status. This was
done by applying estimates of the association between
HER2 status and both ER and PR status based on a review
of the literature. We applied the results from a single,
large, population-based study using immunohistochemistry (IHC) for our base case.16 We then applied rates of
fluorescence in situ hybridization positivity for the proportion of patients who were 2þ using IHC to reflect current recommendations for HER2 testing.17,18 Because
this is a critical aspect of the simulation, we compared the
estimates of HER2þ by each of the ER and PR strata
from our base case to those from other studies for validation purposes and found little variation (sensitivity analyses not reported).19-23
Population estimates of HER21 breast cancer

The resulting incidence rates were applied to the
2005 US female population counts to estimate the number of HER2þ breast cancer cases.24 The estimated
HER2þ patient counts were stratified by nodal status,
and age according to their distributions in SEER (ie, they
did not vary by HER2 status). A recent study suggested
that most, but not all, patients (98%) who should be

5576

tested for HER2 status are receiving testing, and this is
also incorporated into the model.25
Efficacy of Treatment, Recurrence, and
Cardiac Adverse Events
Efficacy of treatment

The efficacy rate for trastuzumab was based on 2
studies that compared doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide followed by a taxane versus the same regimen plus
52 weeks of trastuzumab.5,6 These results are consistent
with other reports on the efficacy of trastuzumab in the
adjuvant setting.7,26 The relative risk of recurrence with
trastuzumab was considered to be constant across subgroups, and to persist for 5 years.27 After 5 years, no recurrences were assumed to be prevented.
Recurrence events

Recurrence events were defined as local recurrences,
distant recurrences, contralateral tumors, and deaths.
Overall recurrence rates from the placebo group were
stratified by nodal status and pooled across studies. The
rate for the trastuzumab group was estimated by applying
the pooled hazard ratio to the placebo recurrence rates.
The rate of recurrence was assumed to be constant over
the 5-year risk period.13 Survival after recurrence was not
modeled.
Cardiovascular events

Two studies (National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and
Bowel Project B-31 and North Central Cancer Treatment
Group N9831) estimated virtually identical proportions
of patients experiencing a cardiac event (primarily defined
as asymptomatic ejection fraction decline below a threshold or frank congestive heart failure including symptoms
of dyspnea with normal activity) based on patients with a
maximum of 3 years of follow-up.28-30 Because the B-31
data were recently updated through 5 years and are very
similar to the 3-year results, we elected to use the B-31
5-year cardiac data, because it matched the time frame we
used to estimate recurrences.30,31 Whereas the intent-totreat trial analysis included patients who never received
Herceptin because of anthracycline-related cardiac complications, the National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and
Bowel Project B-31 analysis of cardiac adverse events
excluded them. Therefore, these patients (approximately
7.5%) were also removed from the group considered to be
at risk of trastuzumab-associated cardiac adverse events
for consistency, and they did not benefit from trastuzumab therapy.28

Costs of Recurrence Events
We searched the literature to estimate the costs attributable to breast cancer recurrence including direct (medical
and nonmedical) and indirect (loss income, productivity,
and caregiving) costs from a societal perspective. The reference year for the analysis is 2008. Direct medical costs for
recurrence events (except death) were adapted from a paper
by Stokes et al1; we extracted the 12-month incremental
cost of recurrence for women with each event compared
with women with no recurrence. These costs were inflated
to 2008 dollars using the medical portion of the consumer
price index.31 In the study by Stokes et al, most of the recurrence events and costs, particularly for distant recurrence, were incurred in the first year. Therefore, we used
the 12-month incremental cost as a proxy for the cost of the
recurrence events. In this evaluation, costs of follow-up,
including the cost of adverse events, were excluded.
We took 2 approaches to valuing the indirect costs
of breast cancer recurrence: 1 excluding the cost of lost
years of life, and the other including it. When excluding
the cost of early death, we identified published estimates
of patient time cost,32 early retirement,33 and lost time
from work34 (we could not identify caregiver burden costs
associated with recurrence). We assumed that patient time
costs were similar for initial and recurrent cancer. Where
necessary, we valued hours using national hourly labor
rates.35 Finally, we incorporated published variability estimates in all costs to allow for variations in our inputs that
reflect both uncertainty and variability.

Cancer

When including death, we used the societal cost of
lost productivity (including caregiver costs) from breast
cancer death published by Bradley et al.36 In this study,
the lost years of life, and their value in terms of productivity losses, decreases with age. To be conservative, we
applied the lowest cost applicable to each of our 3 age
groups (eg, the cost from Bradley et al for age 45-49 was
used for our 30-49 age group). Furthermore, because not
all cancer recurrences lead to death, and because life expectancy after breast cancer diagnosis can take 15 years to
return to normal,37,38 we only applied this cost to the proportion of recurrent patients who were expected to die
within 5 years of diagnosis (79%).1 See Table 1 for key
data inputs to the model.
Scenario Analyses
Several possible exclusions were considered as part of the
scenario analyses. These included the presence of underlying cardiovascular disease based on published prevalence
estimates, and the presence of lymph node-negative, small
tumors (<1 cm), as suggested by National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines.39,40
More specifically, we defined 3 scenarios selected to
represent low and high estimates, with the base case
selected to represent something in between. The base case
excluded women who would not be tested for HER2,
excluded half of women with small (<1 cm) lymph nodenegative tumors defined by the National Comprehensive
Cancer Network guidelines, and included all recurrence-

related events defined in the trials (including second primary and contralateral tumors, and death).
The low estimate made the following changes from
the base case: excluded women with severe underlying cardiovascular disease at baseline, excluded all women with
small (<1 cm) lymph node-negative tumors defined by
the National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines,
and only included recurrence events (ie, no deaths or contralateral tumors). The high estimate made the following
changes from the base case: assumed all patients would be
tested for HER2, and included all lymph node-negative
patients regardless of tumor size.
Finally, the duration of time over which recurrences
were prevented was adjusted to evaluate the importance of
this assumption on the final results.
Calculations
Probabilistic model inputs were included as distributions
(mean and variance) to reflect both variability and uncertainty. Normal distributions were used for continuous
variables, with binomial distributions used for dichotomous events, and log-normal distributions used for cost
data. Relative risks were sampled from a normal distribution on the log scale and transformed back.
When >1 data source was available, variance estimates were created using meta-analysis techniques and
weighted according to the inverse of the variance of each
estimate.41 Breast cancer incidence rate standard errors
were based on estimates provided by SEERStat software.
All other estimates were based on values in the literature,
with the exception of the costs of productivity losses from
Bradley et al,36 which were not reported. The standard
deviations for these costs were estimated as proportions of
the mean using a proxy. The proxy we selected was the ratio of the mean cost to its standard deviation in our simu-

lation of the cost of recurrence, which excluded the cost of
lost years of life (11% to 43% depending on age).
The model was run as a Monte Carlo simulation in
Microsoft Excel using the @Risk 5.0 add-in (Palisade Corp.,
Ithaca, NY). For each iteration of the model, new values
from each input distribution were randomly selected, and
the results were recalculated automatically. Results taken
across multiple iterations were used to estimate the results.
Convergence was evaluated by comparing the stability of the
key results across different numbers of iterations from 1000
to 10,000. On the basis of the stability of the trial runs, all
simulations were run using 5000 iterations and reported as
the mean and middle 95% of the empirical distribution,
which is referred to as a confidence interval (CI).

RESULTS
The data inputs derived from the literature and used in
the model are provided in Table 1. According to the base
case estimates, 31,171 women had HER2þ breast cancer
in 2005, of whom 29,159 might possibly have been
treated given our assumptions. Of these women, 7298
would have had a recurrence over the following 5 years despite current treatment standards. Of these women who
recurred without trastuzumab, 2791 would have avoided
recurrence with the addition of trastuzumab (see Figs. 1
and 2). Trastuzumab use also would have been associated
with an increase of 948 cardiac adverse events, the definition of which includes both symptomatic heart failure and
asymptomatic reductions in left ventricular ejection fraction (see Fig. 3). On the basis of these figures, the ratio of
expected recurrences to cardiac adverse events is 3.2 (95%
CI, 1.5-5.9). This ratio was notably higher for the youngest cohort of women compared with the older 2 cohorts

pooled together (7.2 vs 2.7). See Table 2 for ratios and
95% CI by age group.
The cost of recurrence was estimated both overall
(Figs. 4 and 5) and separately for each age group (Table
2). The cost of recurrence was substantially lower when
the cost of death was excluded. Furthermore, the costs varied across age groups. In the analyses excluding cost of
death, because there were no early retirement estimates for
women aged 30 to 49 years, the cost was higher for
women aged 50 to 69 years. The overall cost was estimated to be $240 million. When death was included, the
total recurrence cost was largest in the 30- to 49-year-old
age group. In economic terms, avoidance of breast cancer
recurrence was associated with savings on the order of
$1.7 billion. More than half of this was from events prevented in the 30- to 49-year-old age group.

events with trastuzumab is shown. Cardiac adverse events

Bowel Project study B-31.28 Not all women with HER2þ
breast cancer were assumed to be treated. Results are based
on 5000 iterations of a simulated cohort diagnosed in 2005
and followed for 5 years.

The base case was adjusted to reflect more conservative and more aggressive assumptions regarding the potential patients who would benefit from therapy. In the low
case, the recurrences prevented were fewer (2267; 95% CI,
1288-3188). In the high case, the values were larger (3087;
95% CI, 1748-4356). Finally, when the time horizon was
reduced to 4 years, the number of recurrences prevented
was smaller (2340; 95% CI, 1331-3285). When the time
horizon was extended to 6 years, the results were notably
larger (3198; 95% CI, 1802-4502). The corresponding
cost estimates for these different scenarios were proportional to the number of recurrences (data not shown).

cancer each year, based on 2005 data. In the absence of
trastuzumab, about 7300 of these women would have a recurrence event even with optimal chemo- and hormonal
therapy. Of these, about 2800 women might have been
prevented from a recurrence event if trastuzumab had
been added to standard adjuvant treatment. This analysis
uses 2005 as a proxy; most other years would be expected
to be similar, because changes in incidence are relatively
slow and would take some time to change these results
substantively. Viewed a different way, over the next 25
years, HER2-targeted therapies would have the potential
to prevent >55,000 cases of recurrent disease, assuming
no substantive changes in the incidence of HER2þ disease. Given the potential for shortages in physician supply
in oncology, fewer recurrences will help to move potentially scarce future resources to other patients.42,43
The corollary to findings is that there are still many
ways to improve outcomes, because there are approximately 4500 women who will have recurrences within 5
years despite optimal adjuvant therapy. This translates to
approximately 90,000 women over the next 25 years for
whom additional improvements in HER2 treatment are
needed. Also, as with any therapy, there are risks to treatment. Cardiac adverse events represent the most significant complication associated with trastuzumab, although
many of them are reversible to some degree. However, the
3:1 recurrence-to-cardiac event ratio suggests a high benefit-to-risk ratio given the potential improvement of the
associated decline in cardiac functioning.
Furthermore, there is some evidence that newer regimens may have lower rates of cardiac adverse events than

5580

seen in studies B-31 and N9831.6,7,27 In particular, in
the Breast Cancer International Research Group study
evaluated the efficacy and safety of 52 weeks of Herceptin administered as a component of both an anthracycline-based
(doxorubicin/cyclophosphamide/taxane/
trastuzumab) and a non– anthracycline-based (cyclophosphamide/taxane/trastuzumab) adjuvant regimen in
comparison to doxorubicin/cyclophosphamide/taxane for
women with early stage HER2þ lymph node-positive or
lymph node-negative cancer. Because the Breast Cancer
International Research Group study has shown that cyclophosphamide/taxane/trastuzumab and doxorubicin/cyclophosphamide/taxane/trastuzumab are not statistically
significantly different in terms of overall survival at 5
years, these simulation results may reflect a conservative
estimate of the cardiac adverse event risk from adjuvant
therapy.44
We also used this model to explore economic consequences. Avoidance of breast cancer recurrence can lead to
substantial economic savings. Depending on whether the
productivity gains (ie, the economic value) from lost years
of life are included, this estimate ranges from $240 million to $1.7 billion over the lifetimes of each 1-year cohort
of patients. It should be cautioned that appropriately valuing the indirect cost of cancer is not a simple undertaking.45,46 The cost of cancer is very broad and includes
some difficult-to-measure aspects; therefore, the inference
from our analyses should not be that these numbers represent the definitive estimate of the value of preventing
recurrences. Rather, what is clear from exploring the cost
data is that there are significant costs of breast cancer recurrence, most of which accrue from lost years of life.
Accordingly, this is the actual value of treatments that can
prevent recurrences, particularly those that are associated
with high mortality risk, such as HER2þ breast cancer.2-4
Because our purpose was to estimate the number of
recurrences and to explore their long-term economic
implications, we did not address the cost of treatment.
However, at least 3 cost-effectiveness analyses have done
so.9,11,12 Assuming no missed doses or dose reductions,
and including costs for time missed from work, Kurian
et al12 estimated, per patient, that 1 year of trastuzumab
and cardiac monitoring would cost $72,285 in 2008 dollars, and would yield approximately 1.4 quality-adjusted
life-years (QALYs). This would translate to approximately
$2.1 billion in total costs and 41,000 QALYs for the
women treated in each year. Although these numbers are
not directly relevant to our study, they should provide
some context for the estimates presented.

Recurrences Prevented With Trastuzumab/Danese et al

As with any model, there are limitations based on
the data and assumptions used to construct the base case
analyses. In general, we tried to remain conservative
(underestimate) where possible. The efficacy of trastuzumab was based on an intent-to-treat analysis. However,
crossover from placebo to trastuzumab occurred in 12%
of patients, which suggests that trastuzumab efficacy may
be underestimated. Also, trastuzumab may reduce recurrences for >5 years, but this is not considered in the
model except for the sensitivity analyses. Although the
base case does not assume that every woman would be
treated, and we conducted scenario analyses to explore alternative base case definitions, it may be that the base case
does not capture the current state of treatment. Finally,
effectiveness in the real world, may be very different from
trial experience, both because healthier patients may have
been selected for the trials, and because patients may not
adhere as well outside of the trials.
In terms of the economic impact, which excluded
the value of lost years of life, we did not include estimates
of caregiver costs, and we did not value early retirement in
our youngest age group. In the estimate that included lost
years of life, we applied no costs to the subset of patients
who recurred but did not die within 5 years. This is likely
to be conservative, because even long-term survivors are
likely to incur some costs, as evidenced by research showing that cancer survivorship is associated with risk of
unemployment.47 Furthermore, because we assigned the
lowest relevant value for productivity losses in each age
group, these are likely to be underestimated.
Although we incorporated uncertainty in our inputs
into the model, because our model represents 1 year, we
did not address potential changes in the population dynamics. The relationship between HER2 status and ER
and PR status may be different by age, or may change over
time. For example, there is some indication that recent
decreases in breast cancer incidence have been observed in
proportionally greater numbers in strongly hormone receptor-positive patients and this trend may not be as
strong in the HER2þ population.48,49 Furthermore,
although this model is based on current trial results, there
is likely to be improvement in outcomes over time as the
treatment of HER2þ tumors evolves. As the SEER program begins to capture HER2 status, and other changes
take place over time, this model can be updated to provide
more accurate information on the societal implications of
treatment.
In terms of interpreting the economic measures, it
should be noted that the model does not address any costs

Cancer

of adjuvant treatment, including the costs of treating cardiac (or any other) adverse events. Because of this, these
economic results should not be considered to be a net gain
for society. Rather, the estimate represents the value of
preventing recurrences as a consequence of treatment,
regardless of the cost of treatment. From the societal perspective, these savings, realized in a subset of HER2þ
patients, could be envisioned as helping to offset costs in
the larger population, including screening, diagnosis, testing, treatment, and adverse events. It should be emphasized, however, that because of the nature of the costs
considered in this model, the value of preventing recurrences does not directly result in tangible savings that can
be immediately invested in the healthcare system.
Regardless of the limitations of this simulation
model, the policy implications are clear. The burden of
HER2þ disease can be significantly ameliorated with
existing targeted therapies. Although this is important,
there is also room for more improvement. Consequently, targeting HER2þ tumors in the adjuvant
setting could prevent a significant number of women
from recurrence events, with important clinical,
humanistic, and economic consequences for patients,
physicians, payers, and society.
