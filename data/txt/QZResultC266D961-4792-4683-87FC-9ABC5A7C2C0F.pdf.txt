ABSTRACT
Growth arrest-specific 5 (GAS5) lncRNA promotes apoptosis, and its expression
is down-regulated in breast cancer. GAS5 lncRNA is a decoy of glucocorticoid/related
receptors; a stem-loop sequence constitutes the GAS5 hormone response element
mimic (HREM), which is essential for the regulation of breast cancer cell apoptosis.
This preclinical study aimed to determine if the GAS5 HREM sequence alone promotes
the apoptosis of breast cancer cells. Nucleofection of hormone-sensitive and
–insensitive breast cancer cell lines with a GAS5 HREM DNA oligonucleotide increased
both basal and ultraviolet-C-induced apoptosis, and decreased culture viability and
clonogenic growth, similar to GAS5 lncRNA. The HREM oligonucleotide demonstrated
similar sequence specificity to the native HREM for its functional activity and had
no effect on endogenous GAS5 lncRNA levels. Certain chemically modified HREM
oligonucleotides, notably DNA and RNA phosphorothioates, retained pro-apoptotic.
activity. Crucially the HREM oligonucleotide could overcome apoptosis resistance
secondary to deficient endogenous GAS5 lncRNA levels. Thus, the GAS5 lncRNA HREM
sequence alone is sufficient to induce apoptosis in breast cancer cells, including
triple-negative breast cancer cells. These findings further suggest that emerging
knowledge of structure/function relationships in the field of lncRNA biology can
be exploited for the development of entirely novel, oligonucleotide mimic-based,
cancer therapies.

pathological characteristics show inverse correlations
with GAS5 lncRNA levels, and low GAS5 lncRNA levels
are often predictive of poor prognosis [11]. A tumour
suppressor role for GAS5 lncRNA is further indicated by
its inhibition of tumour growth in xenograft models of
breast and other cancers [11, 13].
At the cellular level, GAS5 lncRNA promotes
growth arrest and/or apoptosis of multiple cell types
[11], including hormone-sensitive and –insensitive
breast cancer cells [12–14], which is likely to account
for its tumour suppressor function. Since the action of
radiation therapy and many chemotherapeutics depends
on the engagement of the apoptotic machinery [15,
16], this is likely to be significant from a therapeutic
perspective. Indeed, down-regulation of GAS5 lncRNA
levels attenuates apoptosis induction by a broad range
of treatments; for most, cell death shows a direct
quantitative relationship with GAS5 lncRNA levels in
breast and other cancer cells [14, 17, 18]. Consequently,

INTRODUCTION
Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are now
recognized as a major component of the human
transcriptome, but the vast majority of these molecules
remain to be functionally annotated [1, 2]. Nonetheless,
key regulatory roles in fundamental cellular processes are
already evident for several well characterized lncRNAs [3
– 5], and dysregulated expression of these may contribute
to the pathogenesis of major diseases, notably cancer [3,
6, 7]. Consequently, the lncRNAs may offer new targets
for the development of novel diagnostics and therapeutics.
The growth arrest-specific 5 (GAS5) gene is of
particular relevance in this regard. GAS5 encodes lncRNA
in addition to a diverse range of other non-coding RNAs,
including small nucleolar RNAs, PIWI-interacting RNAs
and possibly micro RNAs (miRNAs) [8–10]. GAS5
lncRNA is down-regulated in multiple cancers [11],
including breast cancer [12]. In such cancers, clinicowww.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

enhancing cellular GAS5 lncRNA levels in tumour tissue
may not only suppress the growth of such tumours but
also enhance tumour cell killing by therapeutic agents,
thereby improving patient outcomes.
One way to achieve this therapeutic goal may be
to target the physiological mechanism that mediates the
accumulation of GAS5 lncRNA levels in growth-arrested
cells. GAS5 possesses a 5′-terminal oligopyrimidine (5′TOP) sequence, therefore its translation is promoted by
mTOR, which has high activity in actively growing cells
[8, 19]. Because the GAS5 open reading frame is short
and does not encode a functional protein, this in turn
targets transcripts for degradation by nonsense-mediated
decay (NMD), resulting in low cellular levels of GAS5
lncRNA [8, 19]. Conversely, inhibition of cell growth
and mTOR activity prevents the active translation of
GAS5 transcripts. Since degradation through NMD is
dependent on active translation of the RNA concerned,
GAS5 lncRNA accumulates upon growth arrest [8, 19].
While mTOR inhibitors increase GAS5 lncRNA levels in
hormone-sensitive breast cancer cells, they are ineffective
in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells and other
hormone-independent cancer cells [14, 20], so that
alternative, mTOR inhibitor-independent, approaches are
required to activate this key pathway across a broad range
of cancer subtypes.
Several molecular mechanisms of action have
been proposed for GAS5 lncRNA, which offer
possibilities in this respect. Firstly, it interacts with
and riborepresses certain members of the steroid
nuclear receptor superfamily, and thereby modulates
the transcription of genes regulating apoptosis and the
cell cycle. A stem-loop structure within GAS5 lncRNA
3′-terminal sequence (exon 12 –encoded), which serves
as a hormone response element mimic (HREM), is
required for this interaction [21]. Secondly, it can act
as a miRNA sponge, since it binds to and modulates the
levels of onco-miR21; a distinct (exon 4-derived) GAS5
sequence is required for this activity [13]. Functional
analysis of mutated GAS5 lncRNA sequence has
revealed that while apoptosis induction in lymphoid
cells is only partially dependent on the GAS5 HREM
sequence, more complete dependence is observed
in breast and prostate cancer cells [22], implicating
riborepression as the major mechanism by which
GAS5 lncRNA induces the death of these cells. Novel
oligonucleotide therapy, based on the GAS5 lncRNA
HREM sequence, may therefore be feasible, but it is not
yet clear if this sequence alone is sufficient to mediate
apoptosis induction in epithelial cells, or if additional
GAS5 lncRNA sequence is required. In order to address
these questions, we have examined if the GAS5 HREM
sequence alone is sufficient to promote the apoptosis of
breast cancer cells, both basally and upon the application
of an apoptotic stimulus, and how the resulting cellular
responses compare with those of mature GAS5 lncRNA.

DNA oligonucleotides corresponding to the
GAS5 HREM induce apoptosis in breast cancer
cell lines
Nucleofection of a plasmid encoding mature GAS5
lncRNA induces apoptosis in hormone-sensitive and
-insensitive breast cancer cell lines [12 – 14], and wildtype HREM sequence is required for this activity [22].
In initial experiments, we therefore examined if DNA
oligonucleotides based on the wild-type GAS5 HREM
sequence alone also induced apoptosis in a range of breast
cancer cell lines; negative controls were nucleofected with
DNA oligonucleotides either with stem complementarity
but lacking the GAS5 HRE consensus (stem loop or SL
control) or with scrambled GAS5 sequence (Scram control).
Parallel nucleofection of a plasmid encoding GAS5 lncRNA
(or empty plasmid vector as the respective control) was
performed in some experiments, as a positive control.
In hormone-sensitive MCF7 cells, the apoptotic rate
and culture viability were similar for cells nucleofected
with either the Scram or SL DNA oligonucleotides
(Figure 1A & 1B); levels were indistinguishable from
those of mock-transfected cells (data not shown).
Nucleofection of the HREM DNA oligonucleotide
approximately doubled the apoptotic rate (Figure 1A) and
produced a corresponding decrease in culture viability
(Figure 1B) relative to the control DNA oligonucleotides.
The extent of apoptosis induction by the HREM
oligonucleotide (Figure 1A) was similar to that for MCF7
cells transfected with a plasmid encoding GAS5 lncRNA
(Figure 1C), whereas the latter construct produced a more
sustained loss of short-term culture viability (Figure 1D)
than the HREM oligonucleotides (Figure 1B). Similar
results were obtained for the other hormone-sensitive
cell line, T-47D, studied here. Thus, in this cell line,
the HREM oligonucleotide produced an approximate
doubling of the basal apoptotic rate (Figure 1E), similar
to the GAS5 lncRNA plasmid construct (Figure 1G), and
a corresponding reduction in culture viability (Figure
1F) which was less sustained than for the GAS5 lncRNA
plasmid construct (Figure 1H).
GAS5 lncRNA has previously been shown to
induce apoptosis in hormone-insensitive breast cancer
cells in addition to hormone-sensitive cell lines [17, 18].
Accordingly, in the TNBC line, MDA-MB-231, the GAS5
HREM DNA oligonucleotide also increased apoptosis
(Figure 1I) and reduced culture viability (Figure 1J),
similar to the effects of GAS5 lncRNA (Figure 1K & 1L).

clonogenic growth assays were performed. Transfection
of the HREM DNA oligonucleotide reduced the colony
forming ability of MCF7, T-47D and MDA-MB-231 cells
by 20 – 30% (Figure 2A, 2C & 2E, respectively) i.e., slightly

and SL) oligonucleotides and then, after 24 h, cells were
irradiated with UV-C light at dosages to induce apoptosis
in ca. 50% cells. Parallel transfections were conducted with
plasmid constructs ± GAS5 lncRNA, as a positive control.
Prior transfection with the HREM oligonucleotide enhanced
UV-C-induced apoptosis and correspondingly decreased
culture viability in MCF7 (Figure 3A & 3B, respectively),
T-47D (Figures 3E & 3F, respectively) and MDA-MB-231
(Figures 3I & 3J, respectively) cells. In general, the
magnitude of these effects were similar to those of GAS5
lncRNA (Figure 3C & 3D for MCF7, Figure 3G & 3H for
T-47D, and Figure 3K & 3L for MDA-MB-231), further
highlighting the similar activities of the GAS5 HREM and
GAS5 lncRNA sequences.

The GAS5 HREM DNA oligonucleotide
promotes apoptosis induction upon DNA damage
in breast cancer cell lines
In addition to modulating the basal apoptotic rate,
GAS5 lncRNA promotes apoptosis induction in breast
cells by a range of treatments, including chemotherapeutic
agents and physical stimuli, such as irradiation with UV-C
light, which activates the DNA damage response [12 – 14].
To test whether the HREM oligonucleotide exerts similar
activity to GAS5 lncRNA in this respect, breast cancer cells
were nucleofected with either the HREM or control (Scram

its interaction with the DNA binding domain of the GR
[22]. Mutation of one of these (G549A) is sufficient
to inhibit the GR/GAS5 lncRNA interaction and to
prevent the induction of apoptosis by GAS5 lncRNA
in breast and prostate cell lines [22]. We therefore
examined if induction of apoptosis by the GAS5 HREM
oligonucleotide exhibited similar sequence specificity by
employing a modified DNA oligonucleotide carrying the
equivalent mutation. In MCF7 cells, the oligonucleotide
corresponding to the wild-type GAS5 HREM sequence
induced apoptosis (Figure 4A) and reduced short-term
culture viability (Figure 4B) compared with the SL control

oligonucleotide, whereas the effects of the oligonucleotide
with mutated HREM sequence were indistinguishable
from those of the SL control (Figure 4A & 4B).

cells, siRNA-mediated knockdown of GAS5 lncRNA
attenuates responses to a range of pro-apoptotic treatments,
including UV-C irradiation [13, 14]. To investigate if
the HREM DNA oligonucleotide can overcome such
resistance consequent upon low endogenous GAS5
lncRNA levels, we used siRNA to silence GAS5
expression in MCF7 cells prior to transfection of the
HREM (and control) oligonucleotide, then examined
cellular responses ± irradiation with UV-C light.
The GAS5 siRNA markedly reduced GAS5 lncRNA
levels immediately prior to oligonucleotide nucleofection
(Figure 5A) but this had no effect on basal apoptosis
(Figure 5B) or cell survival (Figure 5C) at 20 h posttransfection of either the SL or HREM oligonucleotide; the
HREM oligonucleotide produced the expected changes of
similar magnitude in these parameters, irrespective of the
endogenous GAS5 lncRNA levels. Cells were then treated

± UV-C light then studied after a further 48 h culture; at
this time point, the mock-irradiated controls demonstrated
a similar pattern of change in apoptosis (Figure 5D) and
cell viability (Figure 5E) as at 20 h post-transfection
(in comparison to Figure 5B & 5C, respectively),
notwithstanding the expected decline in the proportion
of cells undergoing active apoptosis. As regards UV-C
irradiation, prior knockdown of GAS5 lncRNA clearly
attenuated apoptosis induction (Figure 5F) and loss of
culture viability (Figure 5G), as judged from the responses
of cells which had received the SL control oligonucleotide.
Crucially however, prior transfection with the HREM
oligonucleotide enhanced UV-C-induced apoptosis (Figure
5F) and the associated loss of culture viability (Figure 5G),
irrespective of the level of endogenous GAS5 lncRNA.
Notably, the proportions of apoptotic (and viable) cells
were similar for the NC-HREM and #4-HREM treatment

is prone to degradation, especially within exonucleaserich cellular environments, we additionally examined
several oligonucleotides with chemical modifications
to the backbone that improve stability in vivo [23], i.e.,
phosphorothioate RNA [RNA(PT)] and locked nucleic
acid (LNA) oligonucleotides. In these screening studies,
nucleofection of both unmodified RNA and RNA(PT)
HREM oligonucleotides stimulated the basal apoptosis of
MCF7 cells, whereas the LNA oligonucleotide was less
effective and did not reach statistical significance (Figure
7A). Short-term culture viability was also reduced by
the GAS5 HREM RNA and RNA(PT) oligonucleotides
(Figure 7B). As regards long-term survival however, only
the GAS5 HREM RNA(PT) oligonucleotide was able
to reduce the colony forming ability of MCF7 cells to a
degree that was statistically significant (Figure 7C).
Given these findings, it was of interest to
determine if a phosphorothioate DNA [DNA(PT)] form
of the GAS5 HREM also induces apoptosis in MCF7

cells. In addition, a morpholino HREM oligonucleotide
was included in this screen, as the utility of this chemical
modification has already been demonstrated for other
types of therapeutic oligonucleotide (notably antisense
oligonucleotides) [23]. Both chemically modified forms
of the HREM DNA oligonucleotide induced apoptosis
(Figure 7D) and reduced short-term viability (Figure
7E) in MCF7 cells. However, only the DNA(PT)
oligonucleotide reduced the long-term survival of MCF7
cells to a degree that was statistically significant (Figure
7F). Notably, the extent of this reduction was similar
to that of the RNA(PT) form of the GAS5 HREM
oligonucleotide (compare Figure 7C & 7F).

DISCUSSION
Currently, there is a major need to develop new
targeted therapies for breast and other cancers. In the

case of breast cancer, this is especially true for hormoneinsensitive forms of disease, such as TNBC, which is
often characterised by highly malignant behaviour and
resistance to conventional chemotherapy [24]. Much effort
is being focussed on the development of drugs which
directly target oncoproteins [24, 25], while increasing
knowledge of the importance of lncRNAs in health and
disease may offer opportunities for the design of entirely
novel oligonucleotide-based oncotherapies. Towards
this goal, we have exploited recent knowledge regarding
the structure/function relationship of the relatively well
characterized GAS5 lncRNA [22], an apoptosis-promoting
molecule and putative tumour suppressor [11], and
demonstrate here for the first time that oligonucleotides
based on the HREM sequence alone are sufficient to
induce the apoptosis of breast cells. This work is of more
general significance, since it provides the first proof-ofprinciple of using partial sequences to mimic the action

of tumour suppressive lncRNA molecules and, as such,
points to an innovative approach for oligonucleotide-based
oncotherapies of potential clinical importance.
GAS5 lncRNA levels are down-regulated in a
wide range of tumours, including breast cancer; in many
cancers low levels of expression are prognostic of poor
patient survival [11]. The basis for this tumour suppressor
function has been ascribed to the apoptosis-promoting
activity of GAS5 lncRNA, which has itself been shown
to reside within the HREM portion of the GAS5 lncRNA
molecule in breast and other cells [21, 22]. The present
study, which employs independent assays of apoptotic
morphology, short-term culture viability and long-term
clonogenic survival, clearly demonstrates that the HREM
portion alone of the GAS5 lncRNA molecule induces
cell death in three different breast cancer cell lines,
including both hormone-sensitive and –insensitive breast
cancer cells. Notably, for all cells, the extent of apoptosis

induction and inhibition of growth were similar for both
the GAS5 HREM oligonucleotide and GAS5 lncRNA.
The GAS5 HREM oligonucleotide also enhanced
the action of an external apoptotic stimulus, UV-C
irradiation. For both the partial and full length GAS5
lncRNA sequences, this effect was additive rather than
synergistic, as previously noted for the latter sequence
[12, 14]. Of direct clinical relevance, reduced endogenous
GAS5 lncRNA expression, such as occurs in breast
cancer and many other tumours [11 – 14], attenuates
cellular responses to apoptotic inducers, including
UV-C and various chemotherapeutic agents [13, 14];
the GAS5 HREM was able to restore breast cancer cell
sensitivity, as demonstrated here for UV-C irradiation.
Thus in cancers with deficient GAS5 expression, the GAS5
HREM oligonucleotide may have therapeutic potential,
not only by acting as an apoptotic inducer per se, but
also by restoring the effectiveness of more conventional
oncotherapies on therapy-resistant cancer cells.
An important question relates to the mechanism of
action of the GAS5 HREM oligonucleotide in promoting
the apoptosis of breast cancer cells. Our current working
hypothesis is that the partial HREM sequence acts as a
decoy for members of the steroid hormone nuclear receptor
superfamily, as has been demonstrated for GAS5 lncRNA
[21, 22]. In order to test this hypothesis we examined the
effect of a potentially inactivating mutation in the HREM
on its cytotoxic effects. These experiments demonstrate
that the HREM oligonucleotide has identical sequence
specificity to GAS5 lncRNA. Thus, mutation of a single
base (G549A) of the HREM of GAS5 lncRNA diminishes
steroid receptor binding and ablates apoptosis induction in
breast cancer cells [22], and an identical mutation of the
GAS5 HREM oligonucleotide also prevents its induction
of apoptosis in MCF7 cells (Figure 4), indicating that the
mechanism of induction of apoptosis in breast cancer cells
by the HREM is the same as that of GAS5 lncRNA. It is
as yet unknown which particular member(s) of the steroid
hormone nuclear receptor superfamily interact with GAS5
lncRNA in breast cells, particularly in relation to apoptosis
induction; consequently, we have been unable to address
this issue for the GAS5 HREM oligonucleotide. In this
regard, the GAS5 HREM does not interact with estrogen
receptors [21, 22], which are crucial for mediating prosurvival signalling by estrogen in breast cells [26]. While
the GAS5 HREM interacts with progesterone receptor
[21, 22], this interaction is unlikely to play a major role
in breast cancer cell survival, since both GAS5 lncRNA
[14] and the GAS5 HREM sequence induce apoptosis in
TNBC cells which are devoid of progesterone receptors.
On the other hand, a more indirect mechanism of action
for the GAS5 HREM oligonucleotide, centring on
endogenous GAS5 lncRNA per se, can be excluded, since:
i. cellular levels of the latter were unperturbed following
transfection of the GAS5 HREM oligonucleotide; and ii.
siRNA-mediated silencing of GAS5 lncRNA had no effect
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

on the apoptosis-inducing activity of the GAS5 HREM
oligonucleotide in MCF7 cells.
These findings prove that for GAS5 lncRNA,
it is feasible to employ a partial sequence to mimic a
desirable function of the parental lncRNA and thereby
point to the possibility of novel oligonucleotide mimicbased oncotherapeutic approaches. With this in mind,
a range of commonly used chemical modifications
which are known to improve oligonucleotide stability
in vivo [23], were tested for the HREM oligonucleotide
in functional assays. Following nucleofection, most
modified HREM oligonucleotides were able to induce
apoptosis and decrease short-term culture viability,
although this effect was not statistically significant for the
locked nucleic acid form. In terms of inhibition of longterm cell survival, phosphorothioate forms of RNA and
DNA oligonucleotides appeared optimal. These findings
indicate that certain, but not all, modifications to the
oligonucleotide backbone are well tolerated in functional
terms by the GAS5 HREM oligonucleotide.
Mimic oligonucleotides may have widespread
applicability as our understanding of the structure/
function relationships of lncRNA molecules increases.
A particular advantage of such therapies is the ability to
mimic the activity of tumour suppressor genes, which
are often down-regulated in tumours, whereas current
protein-targeted, drug development approaches are biased
towards the inhibition of oncogenic proteins, which are
typically overexpressed in tumours. Furthermore, the
effectiveness of partial sequences, as seen above, makes
oligonucleotide-based approaches more amenable,
since these are inherently less complex and therefore
more practical clinically than gene therapy approaches.
Examples of other therapeutic approaches that exploit
emerging knowledge of lncRNA biology and are
currently under development include siRNA, other
RNAi and antisense oligonucleotide approaches for
targeting oncogenic lncRNAs, antagoNAT antisense
oligonucleotides for targeting antisense lncRNAs to upregulate specific mRNAs/proteins, and small molecule
inhibitor (including oligonucleotides) approaches [23, 27–
29]; the oligonucleotide mimic approach proposed here is
likely to be compatible with and complementary to these.
Indeed, the challenges for clinical translation, in terms of
in vivo stability, tumour delivery and cellular uptake, for
example, are likely to be similar for all these technologies
and are currently the focus of active investigation.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell lines and culture conditions
This study employed hormone-sensitive (MCF7
and T-47D) and –insensitive (MDA-MB-231; TNBC
cells) breast cancer cell lines. All cultures were generated
from secondary stocks of cells which had been frozen
10113

Oncotarget

down within two weeks receipt from ATCC-LGC
Promochem (Teddington, Middlesex, UK), and cultures
were passaged for a maximum period of eight weeks
before replacement with fresh cell stocks. Culture
medium was R-10 medium, comprising RPMI-1640
supplemented with 2 mM L-glutamine, 1 mM sodium
pyruvate, 10 mM HEPES, 10% fetal bovine serum and
50 μg/ml gentamicin, and cells were cultured at 37 °C
in a humidified incubator with 5% CO2. Serum was
from Labtech International Ltd (Uckfield, UK) and the
remaining cell culture reagents were from Sigma-Aldrich
Company Ltd (Gillingham, UK).

siRNA #4) has previously been shown to silence GAS5
expression in MCF7 cells using an RNAiFect protocol
[14]. Briefly, trypsinized cells (2 × 105) were seeded in 2.3
ml R-10 medium per well of a 6-well plate. Complexes
were prepared by mixing 12 pmol siRNA in 0.1 ml OptiMEM-I medium with 12 μl HiPerFect reagent and, after
15 min, these were added to cells. Cells were then cultured
for 20 – 24 h prior to nucleofection with the indicated
oligonucleotides.

Induction of cell death and cell survival assays
At 20 h post-nucleofection with oligonucleotides,
cells were trypsinized and resuspended at 2 × 105 cells/ml
in R-10 medium. A sample was taken for RNA isolation,
and cells were routinely seeded at 1.6 × 105 cells/well of
a 12-well plate. In experiments employing ultraviolet-C
(UV-C) irradiation for apoptosis induction, this was
performed immediately prior to plating, as described
elsewhere [17]; the dose used was 40 J/m2 for all cell
lines; controls were mock-irradiated. Cells were cultured
for a further 48 h, then adherent cells were trypsinized
and combined with non-adherent cells for analysis of
parameters of cell survival.
Apoptosis was routinely determined by assessment
of nuclear morphology of cells by fluorescence
microscopy, after staining with acridine orange (25 μg/
ml); cells containing condensed or fragmented chromatin
were scored as apoptotic. Cell viability was determined
by dye-exclusion assay by counting of nigrosin blue
(0.1% (w/v)) stained samples using a haemocytometer
and light microscopy. To determine long-term survival
of cells, a clonogenic assay was performed: cells were
replated in R-10 medium supplemented with 10 % (v/v)
cell-conditioned medium in 6-well plates, cultured for 3
weeks and the number of colonies formed was determined
post-staining with crystal violet.

Nucleofection of oligonucleotides and
plasmid DNA
DNA oligonucleotides (Eurofins Genomics,
Ebersberg, Germany) were studied in the majority of
experiments and comprised the wild-type GAS5 HREM
sequence (5′- CAGTGGTCTTTGTAGACTGCCTG-3′),
a
mutated
GAS5
HREM
(5′CAGTAGTCTTTGTAGACTGCCTG -3′), a control
sequence which retains stem complementarity but
lacks the GAS5 HRE consensus (stem loop control; 5′CTGATGGTCTTTGTAGACCATCA-3′) and scrambled
sequence (5′- TGTTGGCTTGTCACGCATGCGTCT-3′).
Equivalent stem loop control and wild-type GAS5 HREM
sequences were also employed in experiments with
RNA oligonucleotides (Eurofins Genomics, Ebersberg,
Germany), DNA and RNA phosporothioate-modified
oligonucleotides (GE Healthcare Dharmacon Inc,
Little Chalfont, UK) and morpholino oligonucleotides
(Gene Tools LLC, Philomath, USA). Sequences of
locked nucleic acid oligonucleotides (Exiqon, Vedbaek,
Denmark) containing selective phosphorothioate backbone
modifications (as indicated by *) were: 5′-C+T+G+A+T
+G*G*T*C*T*T*T*G*T+A+G+A+C+C*A*T*C*A-3′
for the stem loop control; and C+A+G+T+G+GT*C*T*
T*T*G*T*A*G+A+C+T+G+C*C*T*G-3′ for the GAS5
HREM. Cells (2 × 106 in 0.1 ml Ingenio electroporation
solution [Mirus Bio LLC, Madison, WI, USA]) were
nucleofected with 5 pmol oligonucleotide or 2 μg
plasmid (either pcDNA3/GAS5—encodes mature GAS5
lncRNA—or empty pcDNA3 vector as control; positive
control experiments) using programmes E-014, X-005
and X-013 for MCF7, T-47D and MDA-MB-231 cells,
respectively, and cells were plated in 3 ml R-10 medium
in 6-well plates.

Real time RT-PCR (RT-qPCR)
Total RNA was isolated with TRIzol, DNasetreated, then reverse transcribed by random hexamer
priming using SuperScript II Reverse Transcriptase [14].
Real-time PCR was conducted on the resulting cDNA
using a SensiFast Probe Hi-ROX kit (Bioline, London,
IK) and TaqMan Gene Expression Assays (assay codes
Hs99999901_m1 for 18S and Hs03464472_m1 for
GAS5; Life Technologies, Paisley, UK); assays usually
contained 10 ng sample cDNA in a final volume of 25
μl and were run on an ABI Prism Sequence Detection
System model 7000. Standards (0.2 – 60 ng cDNA
from untransfected MCF7 cells) were included with
each assay; the resulting standard curves of threshold
cycle (CT) value versus log input standard cDNA were
used to calculate input amounts of samples from their
respective CT values, and data were expressed relative
to 18S rRNA.

RNA interference by siRNA
MCF7 cells were transfected with Ambion Silencer
Select GAS5 siRNA (product code n272331; targets exon
12; Life Technologies, Paisley, UK) or negative control
(NC) siRNA (product code AM4611) using HiPerFect
reagent (Qiagen, Crawley, UK) and a fast forward
protocol. This particular GAS5 siRNA (termed GAS5
