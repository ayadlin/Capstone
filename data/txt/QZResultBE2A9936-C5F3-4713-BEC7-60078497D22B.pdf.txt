ABSTRACT
Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is a heterogeneous disease with resistance to
systemic chemotherapy. Elevated expression of multiple drug resistance (MDR) has
been suggested to be one of the mechanisms for this resistance. Here, we provide
an alternative mechanism to explain RCC’s resistance to chemotherapy-induced
apoptosis. Never-in mitosis A-related protein kinase 1 (Nek1) plays an important
role in DNA damage response and proper checkpoint activation. The association of
Nek1 with the voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC1) is a critical determinant of
cell survival following DNA-damaging treatment. We report here that Nek1 is highly
expressed in RCC tumor and cultured RCC cells compared to that of normal renal
tubular epithelial cells (RTE). The association between Nek1 and VDAC1 is genotoxic
dependent: prolonged Nek1/VDAC1 dissociation will lead to VDAC1 dephosphorylation
and initiate apoptosis. Down-regulation of Nek1 expression in RCC cells enhanced their
sensitivity to DNA-damaging treatment. Collectively, these results suggest that the
increased Nek1 expression in RCC cells maintain persistent VDAC1 phosphorylation,
closing its channel and preventing the onset of apoptosis under genotoxic insults.
Based on these results, we believe that Nek1 can serve as a potential therapeutic
target for drug development in the treatment of RCC.

INTRODUCTION

signature and the chemotherapy resistance nature of RCC
remains an important goal in the identification of targets
for effective treatment.
Intrinsic apoptotic pathways that respond to
cytotoxic stress, including DNA damage, activate a
hierarchical series of caspases that disassemble cells
without inciting inflammation in bystander cells [47]. The onset of apoptosis is initiated by the release
of cytochrome C from mitochondria; after its release
into cytoplasm, it activates Apaf-1 (apoptosis protease
activating factor) which cleaves a series of caspases that
ultimately dismantle the cell by breaking down cell-cell

Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is the most common
and lethal type of kidney cancer in adults. When a tumor
is confined to the kidney, surgical approaches remain as
a curative treatment. However, one-third of the patients
have metastatic forms and require systemic chemotherapy
[1]. Unfortunately, RCC is a chemotherapy-resistant tumor
[2, 3]. A path leading to complete and durable responses
face many challenges because the heterogeneous nature
of RCC contributes to the increase in tumor incidents
and mortality. Thorough understanding of the molecular

contacts, cytoskeletal elements, and nuclear structures [810]. Permeabilization of mitochondria is seminal for the
regulation of apoptosis induced by cytotoxic stress and
is regulated by the mitochondrial permeability transition
pore, composed of the outer mitochondrial membrane
protein VDAC1 (a.k.a. porin), the inner mitochondrial
membrane protein ANT (adenine nucleotide translocator),
and the inner membrane associated protein cyclophilin D
[11-15]. One of the key regulators for VDAC1 channel is
NIMA-related protein kinase 1 (Nek1) [16, 17].
Nek1 is important in the regulation of cell survival,
in part by monitoring the DNA damage response as
well as the apoptosis pathway via its interaction with
VDAC1 [17-19]. In the basal state, Nek1 phosphorylates
VDAC1, which maintains the mitochondrial membrane
potential (MMP). When the expression of Nek1 is downregulated, cells easily lose the S193 phosphorylation of
VDAC1 (Nek1 phosphorylation site) when injured, as
by a DNA damaging agent, and die even with a DNA
damage dose that would not kill identical cells with
a normal amount of Nek1. Taking the roles of Nek1 in
DNA repair pathways and apoptosis suggests that Nek1
functions in defense against oxidative stress and/or DNA
damage, and that relatively trivial environmental injury
may cause unscheduled and excessive cell death in
Nek1-deficient cells. Two strains of mice, Kat and Kat2J,
without functional Nek1 developed polycystic kidney
disease (PKD) and other systemic manifestations [20,
21]. In PKD, one of the key factors in development and
progression to renal failure is unregulated cell death in
renal tubular epithelial cells. Different expression levels
of the wild-type Nek1 in various cell types may account
for a disparity in survival from environmental injury.
Accordingly, higher expression level of Nek1 could be a
contributing factor for the chemotherapy resistance found
in many malignances, especially in RCC.
In this report, we found that Nek1 expression is
increased in RCC compared to RTE. Association of NEK1,
VDAC1 and subsequent VDAC1 S193 phosphorylation
status is regulated according to different levels of
genotoxic stress. Downregulation of Nek1 expression by
small interference RNA increases sensitivity of RCC to
DNA-damaging chemotherapeutic agents.

786-O and ACHN. In the three RCC cell lines, there is
a 2 to 3 fold increase in the Nek1 protein compared to
normal RTE (Figure 1 A, B). Given that Nek1 is a protein
kinase and that its expression is up-regulated in response
to stress, we also examined the expression of other protein
kinases and DNA damage response proteins in these
RCC cell lines. Unlike Nek1, all other proteins examined
showed no significant or consistent differences between
RCC and normal cells (Figure 1A). VHL-associated
transcription regulation (VHL/HIF pathway) is known to
be aberrant in a subset of RCC. In order to determine if
the elevated expression of Nek1 protein in RCC is due
to transcriptional upregulation, we analyzed Nek1 mRNA
using real-time PCR analysis. Nek1 mRNA is significantly
down-regulated in two RCC lines (A498 and 786-O) and
slightly down-regulated in ACHN cells (Figure 1C).
The gene-encoding VHL is mutated in A498 and 786-O
cells but it is wild-type in ACHN cells. This difference
between the established RCC cells suggests that the VHL/
HIF pathway could regulate Nek1 at the transcriptional
level. Nonetheless, Nek1 protein level is independent of
the status of VHL since there is a 2-3 fold increase in Nek1
protein in both VHL mutant (A498 and 786-O) and VHL
wild-type (ACHN) cells compared to normal cells (Figure
1A, B).
To further investigate the potential mechanism
of the up-regulated Nek1 protein expression in RCC
cells, we examined the Nek1 protein turnover rate in
the established RCC cells (Figure 1D). Following the
addition of cycloheximide, cellular lysate was prepared
at different time points and Nek1 protein level was
examined. Nek1 level was diminished quickly after
cycloheximide treatment in HK2 cells, but all 3 RCC cells
shown no deceased in Nek1 protein level, even after 24
hours. In all 4 cell lines, CDT1 were degraded quickly
after cycloheximide treatment suggests that the protein
synthesis were blocked by cycloheximide in all 4 cell
lines (Figure 1E&F). The result suggested the up-regulated
Nek1 protein level in RCC cells is due to a failure of
protein degradation mechanism for Nek1.
Altered gene expression or localization has been
observed frequently in cancer cells. To investigate the
state of Nek1 in RCC cells in more detail, we examined
the subcellular localization of Nek1 in RCC cell lines
by immunostaining. When cells were cultured in
regular, unstressed conditions, Nek1 was localized in
the cytoplasm by indirect immunocytochemical staining
(Figure1G). The expected cytoplasmic staining of Nek1
in the RCC and normal tubular epithelial cell lines also
suggested that the upregulation of Nek1 in RCC cell lines
is not due to peculiar subcellular localization. Next, to
ensure that the function of Nek1 is intact in RCC cells,
we also examined the formation of Nek1 nuclear foci in
RCC cells after DNA damage and its kinase activity. Upon
DNA damage in RCC cells, Nek1 kinase activity was upregulated while Nek1 relocated to the nuclei DNA damage

RESULTS
Nek1 is overexpressed in established RCC lines
Since Nek1 expression level is a critical factor
that modulates cellular responses to DNA damage, we
investigated the Nek1 expression in RCC and normal
diploid cells. An affinity purified rabbit anti-Nek1
antibody was used to examine Nek1 protein expression

was again used to perform the immunohistochemistry
(IHC) analysis. The specificity of anti-Nek1 antibodies for
IHC has been well established in many ways, including
the observation that it does not recognize any protein in
Nek1-null tissue [22]. Immunohistochemistry analysis on
formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue from 5 samples
of stage I renal clear cell carcinoma showed that Nek1
expression is significantly increased in neoplastic cells
compared to the adjacent normal renal tubular epithelial
cells, which have very little Nek1 expression (Figure 2A).
In previous studies [18, 22], we have shown that Nek1 is

The RCC cell lines analyzed above have been
cultured in vitro for years, and the upregulation of Nek1
observed could be acquired from multiple passages in
vitro. To confirm that Nek1 is up-regulated in human RCC,
we examined Nek1 expression of human specimens from

renal cell carcinoma cell lines. Total cell lysates were prepared from a normal monkey diploid kidney cells (BS-C1), normal human renal
diploid cells (HK2), and three human renal cell carcinoma cell lines (A498, 786-O, and ACHN). Protein expression was analyzed by
Western blotting using several antibodies. To control for total protein loading, p84, PSTAIR, VDAC1, and actin, were analyzed from the
same samples. Nek1 expression in HK2 cells was normalized and given a value of 1. The relative amounts of Nek1 expressed in BS-C1,
A498, 786-O, and ACHN cells were then expressed as fold-difference relative to HK2. Results represent analysis and quantification of

DNA damage to the cells, Nek1 translocates to nuclei
at sites of DNA damage, in a punctate staining pattern.
Using high power magnification, we observed that Nek1
is localized to the cytoplasm in RCC clear cells, but also
in nuclei as punctate dots (Figure 2B, C). The nuclear
staining at discrete foci (Figure 2C, insert) suggests that

Nek1, which in the basal state, seems to phosphorylate
VDAC1 and keep the channel closed. To further
investigate the effect of Nek1 overexpression in RCC
cells’ resistance to genotoxic chemotherapy and radiation,
we hypothesize that a decrease in the RCC’s expression
of Nek1 protein would sensitize these cells to genotoxic
agents by reducing the threshold for the induction of cell
death. First, we performed dose-response analyses to
determine the sublethal and lethal doses for normal kidney
diploid cells and RCC cells by treating HK2 transformed
diploid human renal tubular epithelial cells and A498 RCC
cells with different genotoxic agents and then examining
their survivability. For genotoxic drug dosing, cells were
first treated with different agents at varying doses for one
hour. At the end of the 1-hour treatment, the drugs were

to surrounding normal kidney (left side). Higher power magnification (40X) shows subcellular localization of Nek1 in normal tubular
epithelial and glomerular cells (B), and clear cells (C). The nuclear punctate dots staining pattern was observed in 100X magnification (C,

individual tumor samples (all Stage 1 tumors).

out at a density of 2x105 cells per 60-mm dish, 16 hours before the genotoxic treatment. Cells were treated with the indicated doses of
methylmethane sulfonate (MMS, a DNA alkylating agent), 5-FU, etoposide (a topoisomerase II inhibitor), or ultraviolet radiation (UV).
Twenty-four hours after treatment, live cells excluding trypan blue were counted and expressed as the fraction of surviving cells compared
to mock-treated cells. Each data point represents mean s.e.m. from two independent experiments.

either neutralized and/or washed away, and fresh media
was added to the cultures. The A498 cells consistently
showed higher tolerance to the given genotoxic treatment
compared to HK2 cells (Figure 3). For example, the
sublethal dose of methylmethane sulfonate (MMS) is
0.025% and the lethal dose 0.05% (W/V) for HK2 cells,
while the sublethal dose is 0.075% and the lethal dose
higher than 0.1% for A498 cells. Similar results were also
observed in 786-O and ACHN cells (data not shown).

S193 precedes cell death. To know whether the Nek1VDAC1 interaction is modulated in response to different
doses of genomic insults, we determined the dose required
to induce dissociation of Nek1 from VDAC1. HK2 cells
were treated with different doses of the alkylating agent,
MMS. At the end of 1-hour treatment with sublethal or
lethal doses of MMS as determined in Figure 3, cells
were harvested and Nek1-VDAC1 immune complexes
were examined by co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP)
(Figure 4A). A sublethal dose of 0.025% for MMS was
required to induce dissociation of Nek1 from VDAC1
in HK2 cells. If the phosphorylation and interaction
with Nek1 is important for VDAC1’s function and cell
survival, then the dissociation of Nek1 from VDAC1
with sublethal treatment doses should be followed by
re-association during the recovery phase, before seminal
dephosphorylation of VDAC1 on S193 occurs. Reassociation of Nek1 with VDAC1, however, would not
be expected before VDAC1 dephosphorylates in the same
cells treated with lethal doses of genotoxic agents. To test

Dosage-dependent interaction between Nek1 and
VDAC1 in response to genotoxic treatments
As shown in our previous reports, Nek1 interacts
and phosphorylates VDAC1 at S193 in untreated normal
cells [16, 17]. This interaction and phosphorylation of
VDAC1 by Nek1 is important for cell survival. Upon a
lethal dose of UV irradiation, Nek1 and VDAC1 dissociate
from each other, and dephosphorylation of VDAC1 at

Figure 4: Interaction between Nek1 and VDAC1 depends on the dose of the genotoxic agent. A. HK2 cells were treated
with the indicated doses of MMS for 1 hour. Cells were washed twice with PBS and lysed. Clarified lysates were immunoprecipitated with

cells were treated with H2O2 at the indicated concentrations for the specified time periods. Soon after H2O2 treatment, Nek1 and VDAC1
dissociate (lanes 2 and 6). Sixty minutes after treatment with a sublethal dose of H2O2 (0.01 mM), Nek1 and VDAC1 re-associate (lane 4),
but they do not re-associate after an ultimately lethal dose (0.1 mM, lane 8). C. HK2 cells were treated with MMS at either 0.025% (W/V)
(sublethal dose) (lanes 1 to 4) or 0.075% (W/V) (lethal dose, lanes 5 to 8) for one hour. One hour after treatment, MMS was neutralized by
sodium thiosulfate, and cells were washed twice with PBS and re-fed fresh media. At the indicated times, cells were harvested for analysis.
Nek1 and VDAC1 dissociated after MMS treated (lanes 2 and 6). Nek1 and VDAC1 re-associated 4 hours after a sublethal dose of MMS
(lane 4), but not after an ultimately lethal dose in the same type of cells (lane 8). Mock-treated cells (U, lanes 1 and 5) were used as controls.
D. The Nek1-dependent, S193 phosphorylation of VDAC1 was lost after an ultimately lethal dose of MMS. HK2 cells were treated with
MMS as described in C. Total HK2 cell lysates and VS1 antibodies were used to analyze VDAC1 phosphorylation at S193, a key Nek1specific phosphorylation site [17]. After a sublethal dose of MMS, the Nek1-dependent S193 phosphorylation of VDAC1 is intact (upper
panel, lanes 1 to 4), immediately after 4 hours. After an ultimately lethal dose of MMS, the pattern of VDAC1 phosphorylation on S193
is different. Immediately after the lethal treatment, the S193 phosphorylation is intact (lane 6). This Nek1-dependent phosphorylation of
VDAC1 is rapidly lost, however, and is never recovered, up to 4 hours later (lanes 7 and 8).

this possibility, HK2 cells were treated with a sublethal
or lethal dose of different genotoxic agents and Nek1VDAC1 complexes were examined at various time points
during the recovery phase. Co-IP experiments performed
in HK2 cells treated with either H2O2 (Figure 4B) or
MMS (Figure 4C) demonstrated dissociation of Nek1 and
VDAC1 one hour after either a sub-lethal or lethal dose
of either genotoxic treatment. Re-association of Nek1 and
VDAC1, however, identified by co-IP complexes, was
detected only in the cells treated with sublethal doses.
In the cells treated with lethal doses, Nek1-VDAC1
complexes were not detected. The Nek1-dependent
phosphorylation status of VDAC1 following MMS
treatment was also examined using VS1, phospho-VDAC1
(S193) antibodies. VDAC1 remains phosphorylated on
S193 in the cells treated with a sublethal dose of MMS.
In contrast, if the cells were treated with a lethal dose of
MMS, VDAC1 S193 phosphorylation was lost during
what should be the recovery phase from the injury (Figure
4D).

luciferase, did not. Expression of Nek1 was significantly
reduced by 96 hours after the infection. Downregulation
of Nek1 expression had no effect on overall VDAC1
expression (Figure 5B), but it did markedly decrease
the abundance of S193-phospho-VDAC1 (Figure 5C).
Ad-Luci or Ad-Nek1i did not show any effect in cell
growth and survival during the first 60 hours following
virus infection (Figure 5D). To examine whether
downregulation of Nek1 expression in RCC cells would
sensitize them to treatments with genotoxic agents, we
infected the cells with Ad-Nek1i or Ad-Luci. Sixty hours
after the infection, the cells were either untreated or treated
with different doses of genotoxic agents and analyzed 24
hours later. The fraction of surviving cells was determined
by trypan blue exclusion as compared to the untreated
cells. RCC cells infected with Ad-Nek1i were much more
sensitive to the treatment of MMS (Figure 5E) or gamma
irradiation (Figure 5F, Table 1). The control Ad-Luci
had no effect on cell survival after treatment with either
genotoxic agents. These results demonstrate that reducing
Nek1 expression by RNAi mediated gene silencing can
increase the sensitivity of targeted RCC cells to genotoxic
agents.

Reducing Nek1 expression allows renal carcinoma
cells to be more sensitive to genotoxic treatments

DISCUSSION

So far, we have demonstrated that the abundant
expression of Nek1 seems to protect cultured RCC cells
from drug- or radiation-induced, genotoxic apoptosis,
at least in part through Nek1’s interaction with and
phosphorylation of VDAC1. This molecular mechanism
may underlie the genotoxin-resistant nature of RCC. To
test this possibility more directly, we examined the dosedependent interaction between Nek1 and VDAC1 in
RCC cells. A498 cells were treated with different doses
of MMS for 1 hour and the Nek1-VDAC1 interaction
was analyzed by co-IP. In contrast to diploid HK2 cells,
A498 cells require a higher dose of MMS to induce the
dissociation of Nek1 and VDAC1 (Figure 5A). If the
high expression level of Nek1 accounts for stable Nek1VDAC1 complexes detected in RCC cells treated with a
high dose of genotoxic agents, then the downregulation
of Nek1 expression to decrease the Nek1 in the cytosol
in RCC cells might increase their respective sensitivity to
genotoxic agents. To test this hypothesis, we employed
RNAi technology to knock down Nek1 expression in two
RCC cell lines, A498 and 786-O. To assure near 100%
targeting, we expressed short-hairpin RNA (shRNA)
targeting Nek1 in an adenovirus construct. First, we
determined when Nek1 expression was significantly
decreased after adenovirus infection. Cells were harvested
every 24 hours after infection with adenovirus carrying
shRNA targeting either Nek1 (Ad-Nek1i) or a control
construct, luciferase (Ad-Luci). Cell extracts were then
prepared and analyzed for Nek1 expression using Western
blotting analysis. Ad-Nek1i specifically targeted Nek1
protein expression whereas control Ad-Luci, which targets

In this communication, we have reported that
elevated Nek1 protein expression in RCC tumor and
cultured RCC cells compared to that of normal RTE.
Knocking down Nek1 expression in RCC cells renders
them sensitive to DNA damaging treatments. These
observations are consistent with the idea that Nek1
protect cells from oxidative stress and/or DNA damage.
They also support the notion that Nek1 expression level is
particularly critical in malignant RCC tumors, which often
resist DNA-damaging therapeutic agents and in which
hypoxia-induced oxidative injury and genomic instability
are common. RCC is the first example to support the
idea that significant overexpression of Nek1 might adjust
cellular response to environmental insults.
Several NIMA-related protein kinases have been
shown to exhibit altered expression level in neoplastic
cells. They all play roles in cell cycle regulation and
some in DNA damage responses. Among them, Nek2, a
serine-threonine protein kinase, is the best-characterized
one. Nek2 expression level is cell-cycle regulated [23].
Its interaction and phosphorylation of an important cell
cycle regulator, HEC1, ensures the faithful chromosome
segregation [24]. Elevated expression of Nek2 has been
found in several different cancers, including breast cancer,
testicular seminomas, cholangiocarcinoma, etc [25-27].
Furthermore, targeting Nek2 expression by RNA silencing
gene expression has been shown to reduce the tumorigenic
potential of targeted cancer cells [26, 28]. Unlike Nek2,
Nek1 has dual serine/threonine and tyrosine kinase activity
in vitro and its expression is not cell cycle-dependent.

Figure 5: Downregulation of Nek1 expression allows RCC cells more sensitive to genotoxic agents. A. Dose-response:

compared to HK2 cells, a higher MMS dose is required in RCC cells to cause the dissociation of Nek1 from VDAC1. A498 cells were
treated with the indicated doses of MMS for 1 hour. After washing three times with PBS, cells were lysed and Nek1-VDAC1 protein
complexes were analyzed by Western blotting, as in Fig. 4. B. Downregulation of Nek1 expression in A498 cells by RNAi interference.
Short inhibitory RNA, in an adenovirus-based DNA expression system, was used to silence expression of Nek1 in A498 cells. Days after
infection of A498 cells with the siRNA constructs, separated proteins from cell lysates were probed for either the Nek1 expression (upper
panel) or VDAC1 (lower panel). Nek1 expression was markedly reduced by day 4 (96 hours) after an infection with the Ad-Nek1i. Infection
with a control construct to inhibit firefly luciferase (Ad-Luci) had no effect on VDAC1 expression. C. 72 hours after the infection, there was
a loss of VDAC1 phosphorylation on S193 in A498 cells expressing Nek1i. Gel-separated proteins from cell lysates were probed for Nek1
expression (upper panel), VDAC1 phosphorylated on S193 (VS1, middle panel), and p84 (bottom panel, to control for loading). U, mockinfected cells; Luci, cells infected with Ad-Luci, used as a negative control; Nek1-1X, cells infected with a construct containing a single
copy of the siRNA oligonucleotide specific for Nek1; Nek1-4X, cells infected with an otherwise identical construct containing 4 tandem
repeats of the same siRNA oligonucleotide. D. Growth curve of cells after adenovirus infections. A498 cells were plated out at 1X105 cells
per 60mm dishes and infected with either Ad-Luci or Ad-Nek1i 24 hours later. Surviving cells (those excluding trypan blue vital dye) were
counted every 24 hours and cell number was plotted. The adenovirus infections did not alter the cell growth during the first 60 hours, and
Nek1i infected cells started to show no cell number increase after 72 hours (3 experiments). E. Increased sensitivity to the toxicity of MMS
in cells expressing Nek1i siRNA. A498 cells were plated out and infected with either Ad-Luci or Ad-Nek1i. Sixty hours after the infection,
the cells were either mock-treated or treated with 0.025% or 0.05% (W/V) MMS for 1 hour. After neutralization with sodium thiosulfate, the
cells were washed three times with PBS and re-fed with fresh media. Twenty-four hours later, surviving cells were counted and expressed
as fractions of identical, mock-treated cells (5 experiments). F. Greater sensitivity to ionizing radiation in cells with Nek1 expression
downregulated. A498 and 786-O cells were infected with Ad-Luci or Ad-Nek1i. Sixty hours after the infection, the cells were irradiated
with different doses of IR and surviving cells (those excluding the trypan blue vital dye) and were counted 24 hours later (5 experiments).

Both Nek1 and Nek2 are not required for cell survival.
However, Nek1-deficient cells are markedly more
sensitive to the lethal effects of DNA damage compared to
otherwise identical cells expressing functional Nek1 [18,
22]. Lacking Nek1 expression, cells suffer unscheduled
and excessive cell death in relatively trivial environmental
insults. In contrast, our data here suggests that cells with
Nek1 over-expression are more resistant to lethal effects
of DNA damaging agents. Thus, to achieve a fine balance
keeping cells from either apoptosis or accumulating
harmful mutations, the Nek1 expression level needs to be
tightly regulated.
The mechanism underlying Nek1 overexpression
in RCC cells is not known. In our previous study, Nek1
expression is up-regulated in tubular epithelial cells after
ischemic injury, before the cells undergo frank apoptosis,
necrosis or prior to injury repair [29, 30]. Apparently,
Nek1 expression levels in cells with high potential for
errors in DNA damage repair or narrowly defined windows
for proliferation and regeneration after injury becomes a
critical issue. Insufficient Nek1 expression might result
in loss of critical cells at critical time and leads to organ
dysfunction or tumor formation [31]. Increased Nek1
expression leads to improved cell survival due to the
failure of removing critically mutated cells. Candidates of
those critical cells are renal epithelial cells and hepatocytes
which detoxify waste and require frequent regeneration
after injury.
RCC is well known for its chemotherapy resistance.
Over the past few decades, intense research in the
understanding of the molecular biology of RCC has
identified tumor suppressor gene, von Hippel-Lindau
(VHL), as an important molecule in RCC pathogenesis
[32-34]. Inactivation of VHL has been found both in
hereditary RCC as well as in most cases of sporadic clearcell RCC. VHL encodes the VHL protein, a component of
an E3 ubiquitin-ligase complex [35]. The immediate target
of VHL-mediated protein degradation is the hypoxiainducible factor 1A (HIF1A) [33, 36]. Thus, VHL plays an
important role in regulating the hypoxic pathway through
HIF1α. In hypoxic conditions, accumulated HIF1α
binds to HIF1β to form the heterodimeric transcription
factor, HIF, which in turn leads to the transcription of a
wide range of downstream proteins [33]. Among those
are VEGF, platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) and
transforming growth factor alpha (TGF-α) which all have
active roles in tumor angiogenesis and progression [37].
Small molecule inhibitors or monoclonal antibodies for
VEGF receptors and PDGF receptors have been developed
for treating RCC [38]. Another important tumor suppressor
gene, phosphatase and tensin homologue (PTEN), is
also found frequently deleted or mutated in RCC [39].
PTEN functions to oppose phosphoinositide 3-kinase
(PI3K) function, leading to the inactivation of AKT and
mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling [40].
Thus, the downstream mTOR pathway is also an ideal
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

candidate for targeting treatment of RCC. The introduction
of these new molecular targets has offered more options in
the therapeutic strategy. Chemotherapy resistance remains
an important clinical obstacle and research in this area may
lead to new therapeutic options for patients with RCC.
The increased Nek1 protein in RCC is not due to
transcriptional upregulation. In fact, the mRNA level
of Nek1 is decreased in RCC cells and is correlated to
VHL status. In the VHL mutant RCC cells, Nek1 mRNA
is only 25% of the normal RTE-HK2, while it is only
less than 15% reduction in RCC cells with the wild-type
VHL. This increased Nek1 protein level does not seem to
be regulated by VHL. The stability of Nek1 seems to be
responsible for the increased Nek1 protein level in RCC.
In HK2 cells, the half-life of Nek1 protein is around 3
hours. In RCC cells, the half-life of Nek1 is more than 24
hours. Which protein degradation pathway is responsible
of Nek1 stability will need to be investigated further.
The Nek1 protein kinase in the RCC cells appears to be
functional, exhibits a proper subcellular localization and
form IR-induced nuclear foci. In our previous reports,
in cells treated with DNA damaging agents, Nek1
dissociated with VDAC1, and VDAC1 lost its Nek1specific phosphorylation [17]. Nek1 regulates VDAC1
channel opening and closing through phosphorylation
as examined by atomic force microscope (AFM) [16].
Here we show that this dissociation between Nek1 and
VDAC1 and the loss of specific Nek1 phosphorylation
on VDAC1 is genotoxic dosage-dependent. In cells
treated with sublethal dose of genotoxic agents, Nek1
and VDAC1 temporarily dissociated from each other
and the re-association occurred before VDAC1-S193P
became dephosphorylated. However, in cells treated
with a lethal dose of genotoxic agents, VDAC1 became
dephosphorylated and was unable to re-associate with
Nek1. In Nek1-overexpressed RCC cells, higher doses
(often lethal to normal cells) of DNA damaging agents
were needed to induce the dissociation between Nek1 and
VDAC1. By knocking down the Nek1 expression using
small RNA interference, RCC cells became hypersensitive
to genotoxic agents when compared to control group.
This observation opens a new window for developing a
potential treatment for RCC.
The current treatments for RCC are surgical removal
for all stages of RCC. In addition to surgery, several other
treatments will be given to the patient, such as radiation
therapy, arterial embolization, biological therapy or
targeted therapy [41-43]. All the treatments rely on early
diagnosis and surgical resection as the mainstay of RCC’s
treatment. Targeting proteins involved in both DNA
repair pathway and apoptosis has been proposed for drug
development in the treatment of chemo-resistant tumors.
Among them, cell cycle regulatory protein, p21, has been
considered a potential target molecule for RCC. Inhibition
of p21 translation by antisense oligodeoxynucleotide
or siRNA has shown to sensitize tumor cells to DNA

damaging agents. For its role in both proliferation and
differentiation, specific targeting in RCC will be needed
for p21-mediated chemotherapy in order to avoid damage
to normal kidney cells as well as other organs.
The increased Nek1 protein expression in VHL
wild-type cells suggests that Nek1 expression is not
regulated by the VHL pathway at the protein level.
Unlike p21, which is accumulated in the cytosol of
PTEN-negative RCC cells, the function and subcellular
localization of Nek1 is not altered in RCC cells. While
Nek1 mRNA is down-regulated in RCC, the protein level
increased due to the longer half-life. This observation
suggests that a protein degradation program is altered
in RCC and their activity is not regulated by the VHL
pathway. Simple inactivation of Nek1 expression by small
interference RNA in RCC cells increased their sensitivity
to DNA-damaging agents. The results presented in this
report extended our understanding of the roles of Nek1 in
cell survival and apoptosis in response to DNA-damaging
agents. The fact that Nek1 levels determine cellular
tolerance to DNA-damaging agent treatment might begin
to explain the underlying mechanism of chemo-resistance
observed in cancer cells. The expression level of Nek1,
thus, becomes a key survival factor for a given cell in its
tolerance against DNA-damaging agents.

Cells were lysed in Lysis 250 buffer and subjected
to freeze/thaw (LN2/37oC) and clarified by centrifugation.
The supernatants were diluted with equal volume of Lysis
0 and used for immunoprecipitation as described [44].
Mouse polyclonal anti-Nekl antisera (1 μl) or purified
mouse polyclonal anti-Nekl antibody (1 μg) was used for
immunoprecipitation from each supernatant.

Immunohistochemistry
Human biopsy samples obtained at the time of organ
implantation/revascularization or removal. The specimens
were fixed overnight in 10% neutral buffered formalin.
After progressive dehydration and embedding in paraffin,
3-μm sections were stained with Meyer’s hematoxylin
and eosin reagents. For immunohistochemical staining,
4-μm kidney sections on slides were deparaffinized
with Histoclear (National Diagnostics, Atlanta, GA) and
rehydrated with graded ethanol. After treatment with
0.05% saponin in ddH2O, the sections were blocked
with 10% normal goat sera for 30 minutes at room
temperature. Primary anti-Nek1 antibodies were added
at a concentration of 3μg/ml and incubated overnight at
4oC. After extended wash with phosphate-buffered saline
(PBS), biotinylated secondary anti-rabbit IgG antibodies
and peroxidase-based ABC development kits (Vector
Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) were applied. Color was
developed and was then counterstained with methyl
green to identify nuclei. Our Institutional Review Board
specifically approved the use of excess, discarded biopsy
or nephrectomy tissues from humans.

MATERIAL AND METHODS

cells were harvested for further analysis.

Protein stability assay

The adenovirus-based RNAi vector was
generated by subcloning the transcriptional unit of
U6 promoter-Nek1 or -luciferase short hairpin RNA
(shRNA) (0.4 kb) into pAdTrack plasmid upstream of
the CMV-GFP cassette (1.6 kb). The short inhibitory
RNA (shRNA) sequences specific for human Nek1
is 5’-GGAGAGAAGUUGCAGUAUUG-3’ and for
an irrelevant control gene (firefly Luciferase), it is 5’AAGAUUCAAAGUGCGCUGCUG –3’. Adenoviruses
were generated using an AdEasy Vector System
(Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Briefly, after linearizing
with PmeI, pShuttle- Nekli CMV-GFP was mixed with
pAdEasy-1 and electroporated into competent E. coli
BJ5183 cells. A recombinant Ad-Nek1i plasmid was
obtained, purified, and linearized with PacI to transfect
into 293 cells. Recombinant Ad-Nek1i adenovirus
was then generated, amplified, and titered for further
infections. Multiplicities of infection of approximately
30 viral particles per cell were used to obtain efficient
gene transduction in all cases using the recombinant
adenoviruses, and resulted in >99% of the cells expressing
GFP.

Cells were treated with cycloheximide (100ug/
ml) for the indicated time. At the end of each time point,
cells were washed three times with cold 1XPBS. The cell
lysate were then prepared, separated by SDS-PAGE and
analyzed by for Western Blot for Nek1, CDT1 and tubulin
expression.

Cells were treated with MMS at either 0.01% (W/V)
or 0.075% (W/V) for one hour. After an hour of treatment,
MMS was neutralized by sodium thiosulfate and cells
were washed twice with PBS before they were re-fed
with fresh media. For gamma irradiation, cells grown in
log phase were irradiated with measured doses of γ-rays
using cesium-40 at the rate of 116 cGy/min. Medium
was replaced for all cells immediately after irradiation.
Percentages of cells still surviving 24 hours after different
doses of IR were determined by counting the number
of cells excluding trypan blue vital dye in triplicates,
divided by the total number of cells per plate. For the
H2O2 treatment, H2O2 was added to the final indicated
concentration and cells were cultured for one hour before
they were harvested for the analysis. For the 5FU and
etoposide treatment, cells were incubated in the indicated
concentration of drug for one hour, the drug treatment was
then removed and refed with fresh media. 24 hours later,
