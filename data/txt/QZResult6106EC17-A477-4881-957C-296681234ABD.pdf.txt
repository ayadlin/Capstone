ABSTRACT
Current knowledge indicates that the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)
functions as two complexes, mTORC1 and mTORC2, regulating cell growth,
proliferation, survival, differentiation, and motility. Recently mSin1 has been identified
as a critical component of mTORC2, which is essential for phosphorylation of Akt and
other signaling molecules. Studies have shown that rapamycin inhibits phosphorylation
of mSin1. However, the underlying mechanism is unknown. Here we found that
rapamycin inhibited phosphorylation of mSin1 potently and rapidly. Expression of
rapamycin-resistant mutant of mTOR (mTOR-T), but not rapamycin-resistant and
kinase dead mutant of mTOR (mTOR-TE), prevented rapamycin from inhibiting mSin1
phosphorylation, suggesting that rapamycin-induced dephosphorylation of mSin1
is mTOR-dependent. Surprisingly, ectopic expression of rapamycin-resistant and
constitutively active p70 S6 kinase 1 (S6K1) did not confer resistance to rapamycininduced dephosphorylation of mSin1. Furthermore, disruption of mTORC1 and mTORC2
by silencing raptor and rictor, respectively, or downregulation of S6K1 or Akt did not
induce the dephosphorylation of mSin1 as rapamycin did. However, silencing mTOR
or mLST8 mimicked the effect of rapamycin, inhibiting mSin1 phosphorylation. Our
findings suggest that rapamycin inhibits mSin1 phosphorylation, which is independent
of mTORC1 and mTORC2, but is possibly dependent on a new mTOR complex, which
at least contains mTOR and mLST8.

INTRODUCTION
The mammalian target of rapamycin or the
mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR), a member of the
phosphoinositide-3’ kinase (PI3K)-related kinase family,
lies downstream of the type I insulin-like growth factor
(IGF-1) receptor-PI3K [1, 2]. Studies have demonstrated
that mTOR functions at least as two complexes (mTORC1
and mTORC2) in mammalian cells [1, 2]. mTORC1
contains mTOR, mLST8 (mammalian lethal with sec-13

protein synthesis, lipid synthesis, and lysosome biogenesis
through mediating phosphorylation of ribosomal p70
S6 kinase 1 (S6K1) and eukaryotic initiation factor 4E
(eIF4E) binding protein 1 (4E-BP1) [1, 2]. mTORC2 is
only sensitive to prolonged (>24 h) rapamycin exposure
in certain cases and growth factors, and regulates
cell survival and cytoskeletal organization in part by
regulating phosphorylation of Akt [17, 18], serum and
glucocorticoid-inducible kinase 1 (SGK1) [19], protein
kinase C α (PKCα) [11] and focal adhesion proteins [10,
11, 20], as well as the activity of small GTPases [10, 21,
22]. Both mTORC1 and mTORC2 interact with a negative
regulator, DEPTOR (DEP domain containing mTORinteracting protein) [23], and a positive regulator, the Tti1/
Tel2 complex [24]. Though the functions of the mTOR
complexes remain to be unveiled, current data indicate that
mTOR plays a central role in the regulation of cell growth,
proliferation, differentiation, survival, and motility, as well
as angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis [2, 25].
Mutations of MTOR gene have recently been found
to be associated with the hyperactivation of mTOR in
tumors [26–28]. High frequency of mutations of other
components (such as PTEN, TSC, and PI3K) in mTOR
signaling pathway has also been observed to link to
human malignant progression and poor prognosis [2,
29, 30]. Interestingly, tumor cells with deregulated
mTOR signaling are more sensitive to mTOR inhibitors,
supporting that mTOR pathway is a promising target for
cancer therapy. Rapamycin is the first identified inhibitor
of mTOR. Unlike the new generation of ATP-competitive
mTOR kinase inhibitors (such as AZD8055, INK 128,
PP242, and Torin 2), rapamycin cannot directly bind to
mTOR. Instead, it has to first form a complex with the
cytosolic protein FK506 binding protein 12 (FKBP12) and
then binds to the FKBP-binding (FRB) domain of mTOR,
inhibiting certain functions of mTOR [1, 2]. While two
rapamycin analogs (rapalogs), CCI-779 (Temsirolimus,
Wyeth) and RAD001 (Everolimus, Novatis), have been
approved by the US Food and Drug Administration
(FDA) for treatment of metastatic renal cell carcinoma
and advanced pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors, they
only display modest anticancer efficacy in many other
types of tumors [31]. It has been proposed that this is
related to rapalogs activation of Akt and other survival
pathways through insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS-1)/
Grb10 feedback mechanisms [32–35]. However, in fact,
the effects of rapalogs on Akt are complex. It has been
described that prolonged (24 h) exposure to rapamycin
(100 nM) caused activation of Akt in HeLa and H460
cells, weak inhibition in HEK-293T cells, and strong
inhibition in PC-3 cells, although mTORC1-mediated
S6K1 phosphorylation was completely blocked in all cases
[18]. Therefore, the anticancer mechanism of rapamycin
(or rapalogs) remains enigmatic.
In addition to inhibition of phosphorylation of S6K1
and 4E-BP1, rapamycin has recently been found to inhibit
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

phosphorylation of rictor [36, 37] and mSin1 as well
[38, 39]. While the physiological significance of rictor
or mSin1 phosphorylation is under investigation, studies
have revealed that S6K1 phosphorylates rictor (Thr1135),
and rapamycin inhibition of this phosphorylation is by
suppressing mTOR-mediated S6K1 [37]. To date, how
rapamycin inhibits phosphorylation of mSin1 remains a
mystery.
In this study, we found that rapamycin inhibited
mSin1 phosphorylation in an mTOR kinase activitydependent manner. To our surprise, neither mTORC1
nor mTORC2 was involved in the regulation of mSin1
phosphorylation. However, silencing mTOR or mLST8
did mimic the effect of rapamycin, inhibiting mSin1
phosphorylation. Our results imply that rapamycin inhibits
mSin1 phosphorylation possibly through targeting an
unidentified third mTOR complex, which contains at least
mTOR and mLST8.

RESULTS
Rapamycin inhibits phosphorylation of mSin1 in
a concentration- and time-dependent manner
To determine the effect of rapamycin on
phosphorylation of mSin1, Rh1 cells, a rapamycinsensitive human Ewing sarcoma cell line [40, 41], were
initially selected for the study. As there were no antibodies
against phospho-mSin1 available commercially, at
the beginning, we detected phosphorylation of mSin1
according to the electrophoretic mobility of mSin1 by
Western blot analysis, as described by other groups
[38, 39]. As shown in Figure  1A, serum starvation for
24 h did not increase the electrophoretic mobility of
mSin1 in Rh1 cells, but treatment of the serum-starved
cells with rapamycin (100 ng/ml) for 24 h increased the
electrophoretic mobility of mSin1 obviously, regardless of
stimulation with or without IGF-1 (10 ng/ml), suggesting
that rapamycin might inhibit phosphorylation of mSin1.
Furthermore, similar results were also observed in other
cell lines, including human cervical cancer (HeLa),
prostate cancer (PC-3), rhabdomyosarcoma (Rh30) cells
and mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF) (Figure 1A and
1B), demonstrating that rapamycin inhibition of mSin1
phosphorylation is not cell line-dependent. To verify the
electrophoretic mobility of mSin1 is correlated to its
phosphorylation status, shrimp alkaline phosphatase (SAP)
was used. We found that treatment of Rh30 cell lysates
with SAP for 30 min reversed the mobility of mSin1 in
the control (data not shown) or IGF-1-treated cells to that
of rapamycin-treated cells (Figure  1B), revealing that
the increased mSin1 mobility shift was indeed due to
its dephosphorylation. In addition, rapamycin inhibition
of mSin1 phosphorylation was further confirmed by
32
P-labeling (Figure 1C, 1D).

Rapamycin inhibits phosphorylation of mSin1 in
an mTOR kinase activity-dependent manner

To better understand the inhibitory effect of
rapamycin on mSin1 phosphorylation, dose-response
and time-course experiments were carried out. We
found that when serum-starved Rh30 cells were pretreated with rapamycin (0–1,000 ng/ml) for 2 h, and
then stimulated with or without IGF-1 (10 ng/ml) for 10
h, as expected, rapamycin inhibited the basal or IGF-1stimulated phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 and S6K1, two best
characterized downstream effector molecules of mTOR in
a concentration-dependent manner (Figure 2A). Of interest,
rapamycin also inhibited phosphorylation of mSin1 in
a similar manner. Noticeably, rapamycin was able to
increase mSin1 mobility shift at a very low concentration
(0.05 ng/ml) (Figure 2A). Similarly, when the cells were
pretreated with rapamycin (100 ng/ml) for 0–24 h, and then
stimulated with or without IGF-1 (10 ng/ml) for 15 min,
rapamycin was also found to be able to inhibit the basal
or IGF-1-stimulated phosphorylation of mSin1 in a timedependent manner. The inhibitory effect was rapid and
remarkable within 2 h treatment (Figure 2B).

It has been described that rapamycin inhibits skeletal
myogenesis in an mTOR kinase activity-independent
manner [42, 43], although this remains controversial
[44, 45]. To determine whether rapamycin inhibition of
mSin1 phosphorylation depends on the kinase activity
of mTOR, serum-starved Rh30 cells were infected with
recombinant adenoviruses expressing empty vector (GFP),
FLAG-tagged rapamycin-resistant kinase active mTOR
(S2035T, mTOR-T), and rapamycin-resistant kinasedead mTOR (S2035T/D2357E, mTOR-TE), respectively.
Subsequently, the cells were pre-treated with or without
rapamycin for 2 h, and then stimulated with IGF-1 (10 ng/
ml) for 10 h. Consistent with our previous observations
[20, 21], expression of mTOR-T, but not mTOR-TE or
GFP, potently prevented rapamycin from inhibiting
phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 and S6K1 (Figure 3A), two
best-characterized substrates of mTOR [1, 2]. Of note,

the phosphorylation state of 4E-BP1 was detected with an
antibody to 4E-BP1. Rapamycin inhibited phosphorylation
of 4E-BP1, as indicated by the decrease in the intensity
of the uppermost band γ and by the increase in the
higher mobility band α and β that corresponds to a less
phosphorylated form of 4E-BP1. The results indicate that
mTOR-T functioned as a rapamycin-resistant and kinase
active mutant, and mTOR-TE as a kinase-dead mutant in
Rh30 cells. Interestingly, expression of mTOR-T, but not

mTOR-TE or GFP, conferred high resistance to rapamycin
inhibition of mSin1 phosphorylation (Figure  3A),
suggesting that rapamycin inhibits phosphorylation of
mSin1 in an mTOR kinase activity-dependent manner.
We also substantiated the above finding using RNA
interference. As expected, silencing mTOR dramatically
decreased the mTOR kinase activity, since the basal or
IGF-1-stimulated phosphorylation of S6K1 (Thr389),
routinely used as an indicator of mTOR kinase activity

(Figure 3B). Of importance, silencing mTOR remarkably

phosphorylation of mSin1.

control shRNA to GFP, downregulated the protein level
of S6K1 by ~85% (vs. control), and abolished the basal
or IGF-1-stimulated phosphorylation of S6K1, in Rh30
cells (Figure  4B), indicating the shRNA was working
well in the cells. However, silencing S6K1 failed to
reduce the basal or IGF-1-stimulated phosphorylation
of mSin1, when rapamycin was absent (Figure  4B).
The results support the notion that rapamycin-induced
dephosphorylation (band shift) of mSin1 is independent
of S6K1.

Rapamycin inhibits phosphorylation of mSin1
not via targeting S6K1
Both rictor and mSin1 are the components of
mTORC2 [1, 2], and S6K1 has recently been identified
as the kinase that phosphorylates rictor (Thr1135) [37, 46,
47]. Particularly, it has been described that mSin1 can be
phosphorylated on T86 and T398 by S6K1 in a cellular
context-dependent manner [48]. Therefore, at the very
beginning, we hypothesized that rapamycin may inhibit
mSin1 phosphorylation by suppressing the activity of
S6K1. To test this hypothesis, Rh30 cells were infected
with recombinant adenovirus encoding constitutively
active and rapamycin-resistant HA-tagged S6K1 mutant
(F5A-E389-R3A) (Ad-S6K1-ca) and the control virus
encoding GFP (Ad-GFP), respectively. In agreement
with our previous data [49], expression of constitutively
active and rapamycin-resistant (HA-S6K1-ca), but not
GFP, increased the basal phosphorylation level of S6
ribosomal protein, a substrate of S6K1, and conferred
resistance to rapamycin inhibition of S6 phosphorylation
(Figure 4A), suggesting that the S6K1-ca was functional
in the cells. However, expression of the rapamycinresistant constitutively active S6K1 failed to prevent
rapamycin from inhibiting the phosphorylation of mSin1
(Figure 4A). The results suggest that rapamycin-induced
dephosphorylation of mSin1 is probably not by inhibiting
S6K1 activity.
To corroborate the above finding, S6K1 was
silenced using lentiviral shRNA to S6K1. We found that
infection with lentiviral shRNA to S6K1, but not the

Rapamycin inhibits phosphorylation of mSin1
independently of mTORC1
mTORC1 is sensitive to rapamycin [1, 2]. It is
likely that rapamycin inhibits mSin1 phosphorylation by
targeting other mTORC1-mediated signaling molecules,
instead of S6K1. For this, we directly determined
whether mTORC1 is responsible for the phosphorylation
of mSin1. In consistence with our previous findings
[20,  49], infection with lentiviral shRNA to raptor,
but not the control shRNA to GFP, downregulated the
protein level of raptor by ~90% (vs. control) in Rh30
cells. Downregulation of raptor inhibited mTORC1mediated phosphorylation of S6K1 (Thr389), a surrogate
for mTORC1 activity in the cells (Figure 5). However,
downregulation of raptor did not inhibit the basal or IGF1-stimulated phosphorylation of mSin1 as rapamycin
did (Figure 5). The results demonstrate that rapamycin
inhibits mSin1 phosphorylation, which is independent of
mTORC1.

Currently, only two mTOR complexes, mTORC1
and mTORC2, have been identified [1, 2]. Since
rapamycin-induced dephosphorylation of mSin1 was

DISCUSSION

found to be independent of mTORC1 (Figure 5), next
we turned to ask whether mTORC2 is involved in this
event. To this end, mTORC2 was disrupted by silencing
rictor. We found that infection with lentiviral shRNA to
rictor, but not the control shRNA to GFP, downregulated
the protein level of rictor by ~90% (vs. control) in Rh30
cells. Downregulation of rictor inhibited the basal or
IGF-1 stimulated phosphorylation of Akt (Ser473) in
the cells (Figure 6A). In line with our previous results
[20], rapamycin induced phosphorylation of Akt
(Ser473) in Rh30 cells (Figure 6A), although it inhibited
phosphorylation of S6K1 and 4E-BP1 (Figure  2). As
rictor and mSin1 interact with and stabilize each other
[12], downregulation of rictor also reduced the cellular
protein level of mSin1 correspondingly (Figure  6A).
However, downregulation of rictor did not inhibit the
basal or IGF-1-stimulated phosphorylation of mSin1
as rapamycin did (Figure  6A). Moreover, silencing
Akt, a major substrate of mTORC2, did not reduce
phosphorylation of mSin1 either (Figure 6B). The results
indicate that rapamycin inhibits mSin1 phosphorylation
independently of mTORC2 as well.

mTOR functions as two complexes, mTORC1 and
mTORC2, regulating cell growth, proliferation, survival,
differentiation and motility [1, 2]. While intensive studies
have focused on mTORC1, the mTORC2 signaling is
only at the beginning to be recognized. Rictor and mSin1
interact with and stabilize each other, and are crucial for
the integrity and the function of mTORC2 [12]. In addition
to inhibiting mTORC1-mediated phosphorylation of S6K1
and 4E-BP1, rapamycin has recently been found to inhibit
phosphorylation of rictor [36, 37] and mSin1 as well
[38, 39]. Studies have revealed that S6K1 phosphorylates
rictor (Thr1135), and rapamycin inhibition of rictor
(Thr1135) phosphorylation is through suppressing S6K1
[37, 46, 47]. However, so far, how rapamycin inhibits
mSin1 phosphorylation remains largely unknown. Here
we show that rapamycin inhibited mSin1 phosphorylation
in an mTOR kinase activity-dependent manner. This
is supported by the observations that 1) expression of
rapamycin-resistant kinase active mTOR (mTOR-T), but
not rapamycin-resistant kinase dead mTOR (mTOR-TE),
prevented rapamycin inhibition of mSin1 phosphorylation;
and 2) silencing mTOR also inhibited mSin1 phos­
phorylation. Our findings strongly support the notion that
mTOR regulates phosphorylation of mSin1.
To elucidate the molecular mechanism whereby
rapamycin inhibits mSin1 phosphorylation, at the very
beginning, we were focusing on S6K1, since S6K1 has
been found to phosphorylate mSin1 on Thr86 and Thr398
[48]. However, in this study, we found that S6K1, in spite
of being highly sensitive to rapamycin, was not involved
in rapamycin-induced dephosphorylation of mSin1.
This is evidenced by the findings that ectopic expression
of rapamycin-resistant and constitutively active S6K1
(S6K1-ca) did not confer obvious resistance to rapamycininduced dephosphorylation of mSin1, and silencing S6K1
did not induce the electrophoretic mobility of mSin1 as
rapamycin did.

mLST8 is essential for mTOR-mediated
phosphorylation of mSin1
As mLST8 is an essential component for all mTOR
complexes identified so far [1, 2], next we investigated
whether the phosphorylation of mSin1 requires the
involvement of mLST8. For this, Rh30 cells were infected
with lentiviral shRNA to mLST8 or GFP (as a control). As
illustrated in Figure 7A, mLST8 was downregulated by
~80%, in Rh30 cells by the lentiviral shRNA to mLST8.
Silencing mLST8, like silencing mTOR (Figure  3B),
inhibited the basal and IGF-1-stimulated phosphorylation
of mSin1, even in the absence of rapamycin. Similar
results were observed in HeLa cells (Figure  7B). The
results indicate that mLST8 is necessary for mTORmediated phosphorylation of mSin1.

As rapamycin inhibited mSin1 phosphorylation
within 2 h (Figure  2B), and mTORC1 is sensitive to
acute rapamycin treatment [1, 2], we next reasoned that
rapamycin-induced dephosphorylation of mSin1 is most
likely by targeting mTORC1, although mTOR-mediated
S6K1 pathway had been ruled out in this event (Figure 4).
It has been described that rapamycin inhibits mTORC1,
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

resulting in activation protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A)
[50]. Possibly, rapamycin inhibits phosphorylation of
mSin1 by activation of PP2A. However, out of our
expectation, disruption of mTORC1 by silencing raptor
did not inhibit mSin1 phosphorylation as rapamycin
did (Figure 5), pointing out that the rapamycin-induced
dephosphorylation of mSin1 is not mediated by mTORC1.

Although S6K1-mediated phosphorylation of rictor
(Thr1135) does not affect mTORC2 integrity or in vitro
kinase activity, it causes an increase in 14-3-3 binding
to rictor and mTORC2-dependent phosphorylation
of Akt (Ser473) in cells [37, 46, 47], suggesting a
potential crosstalk between mTORC1 and mTORC2.
After demonstrating that mSin1 phosphorylation is
independent of mTORC1, we further examined whether
this is dependent on mTORC2, although mTORC2 is only
sensitive to prolonged rapamycin treatment in certain cases
[18]. However, surprisingly, disruption of mTORC2 by
silencing rictor failed to induce the electrophoretic mobility
of mSin1 as rapamycin did, suggesting that rapamycininduced dephosphorylation of mSin1 is independent
of mTORC2 as well. This is further supported by the
observation that downregulation of Akt, a major substrate
of mTORC2, did not induce the electrophoretic mobility of
mSin1 as rapamycin did. However, interestingly, silencing
mTOR or mLST8 (a component shared by all mTOR
complexes) recapitulated the effect of rapamycin on the
phosphorylation of mSin1. Our results imply that rapamycin
inhibits mSin1 phosphorylation possibly through targeting
an unidentified third mTOR complex, which contains at
least mTOR and mLST8. Hall group has reported that in
addition to TORC1 and TORC2, actually TOR can interact
with numerous proteins, as a 2-megadalton TOR protein
complex has been detected by gel filtration [7]. Recently,
a new TOR complex, which contains TOR, LST8 and
Armadillo domain-containing protein (TbArmtor), has
been identified in the parasite, Trypanosoma brucei [52].
Further research is needed to unveil whether there exists
a similar counterpart in mammalian cells, and whether it
mediates mSin1 phosphorylation.
Recently, it has been found that mSin1 can be
phosphorylated on Thr86 and Thr398 by either Akt or
S6K in a cell-dependent manner [48, 51]. Interestingly,
the phosphorylation of mSin1 on both Thr86 and Thr398,
but not on Thr86 alone, is required for the integrity and
the activity of mTORC2 [48, 51]. In the present study,
we found that downregulation of S6K1 or Akt failed to
increase the electrophoretic mobility (dephosphorylation)
of mSin1 under our experimental conditions, suggesting
that rapamycin induced the band shift of mSin1 possibly
by inducing dephosphorylation of more other residues.
In consistence with our previous observation [20], here
we found that rapamycin induced phosphorylation of Akt
(Ser473) in Rh30 cells, but inhibited phosphorylation
of mSin1 (Figure  6). Our results indicate that the Akt
phosphorylation may be independent of rapamycininduced dephosphorylation of mSin1.
mTOR is regulated by multiple upstream factors
including growth factors and nutrients such as glucose
and amino acids [1, 2]. In response to growth factors
deprivation or nutrients starvation, mTORC1 can be
inhibited, which may lead to reduced protein/lipid
synthesis, inhibiting cell growth and inducing autophagy
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

[1, 2]. It has been demonstrated that the small GTPase
Rheb (Ras homolog enriched in brain) directly interacts
with and activates mTOR [53]. Tuberous sclerosis complex
1/2 (TSC1/2), a tumor suppressor, acts as a GTPaseactivating protein (GAP) for Rheb [54–57]. Growth
factors or hormones (e.g. IGF-1 and insulin) activate
mTORC1 by inhibiting TSC1/2 function [1, 2]. Hence, in
response to growth factors deprivation or serum-starvation,
mTORC1 activity is reduced in normal cells, but remains
constitutively active in TSC-mutant cells [30]. Under
glucose starvation (low ATP) condition, AMP-activated
protein kinase (AMPK) can be activated [58]. Activated
AMPK can inhibit mTORC1 signaling via activation of
TSC1/2 and induce phosphorylation of raptor (Ser792) [59,
60]. Recently, it has been found that Rag small GTPases
relay signals from amino acids to activate mTORC1
[61–63]. Amino acid starvation inhibits Rag-Ragulator
mediated translocation of mTORC1 to lysosomal
membranes, preventing mTORC1 activation [30].
In the present study, we noticed that serumstarvation or stimulation with IGF-1 did not affect the
electrophoretic mobility of mSin1 (Figure  1A and 1B),
but IGF-1 was found to slightly increase phosphorylation
of mSin1 by 32P-labeling (Figure 1C). Rapamycin was
able to increase the electrophoretic mobility of mSin1 in a
spectrum of cell lines (Rh1, Rh30, PC-3, HeLa and MEF),
regardless of presence or absence of IGF-1 (Figure 1A and
1B). The results suggest that only one or a few residues on
mSin1 are sensitive to IGF-1-stimulated phosphorylation,
but more residues are independent of growth factors
for mTOR-mediated phosphorylation. It is known that
mTORC1 is sensitive to rapamycin, growth factors,
energy, amino acids, stress and redox levels [1, 2], whereas
mTORC2 is only sensitive to prolonged (>24 h) rapamycin
exposure in certain cases and growth factors [18]. Our
observation implies that the unidentified third mTOR
complex may be different from mTORC1 or mTORC2,
which is sensitive to rapamycin, but may be insensitive to
growth factors. Further research is required to address this
issue. Recently, it has been described that mTOR stabilizes
mSin1 by phosphorylating its hydrophobic and conserved
Ser260 site to maintain the integrity of mTORC2 [64].
Also, glucose deprivation or acute ATP depletion, but not
amino acid deprivation, prevents the mTOR-dependent
phosphorylation of mSin1 on Ser260 and Akt on
Thr450 in cells [64], further suggesting that mTOR may
regulate phosphorylation of mSin1 on unique residues,
in response to specific environmental cues. Therefore, it
would be of great importance to unveil whether the new
mTOR complex is sensitive to energy (glucose or ATP),
amino acids, stress and redox levels, and whether it is
evolutionally conserved from yeast to mammals.
In summary, here, for the first time, we have shown
that rapamycin inhibited mSin1 phosphorylation, which
were not through inhibiting either mTORC1/S6K1 or
mTORC2/Akt pathway (Figure  8). However, silencing

Figure 8: A proposed model showing how rapamycin inhibits mSin1 phosphorylation. Neither mTORC1/S6K1 nor

mTORC2/Akt was found to be involved in the regulation of mSin1 phosphorylation. However, silencing mTOR or mLST8 inhibited
the phosphorylation of mSin1 as rapamycin did. Thus, we propose that rapamycin may inhibit mSin1 phosphorylation by targeting an
unidentified third mTOR complex (mTORC3) that contains at least mTOR and mLST8.

mTOR or mLST8 was able to inhibit the phosphorylation
of mSin1 as rapamycin did. Our findings suggest that
rapamycin may inhibit mSin1 phosphorylation probably
by targeting an unidentified third mTOR complex
(mTORC3) that contains at least mTOR and mLST8
(Figure 8). Further efforts are needed to identify this new
complex, and to determine the phosphorylation site(s)
of mSin1 as well as the physiological significance of the
mSin1 phosphorylation.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Human rhabdomyosarcoma Rh30 and Ewing
sarcoma Rh1 cells were generously provided by Dr. Peter
J. Houghton (Nationwide Children’s Hospital, Columbus,
OH), and grown in antibiotic-free RPMI 1640 medium
(Mediatech, Herndon, VA) supplemented with 10% fetal
bovine serum (FBS) (Hyclone, Logan, UT). Human
cervical adenocarcinoma (HeLa), prostate adenocarcinoma
(PC-3) (American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA),
and wild-type (wt) mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF)
[13] were grown in antibiotic-free Dulbecco’s Modified
Eagle Medium (DMEM) (Mediatech) supplemented
with 10% FBS. Human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293
(American Type Culture Collection), 293A, and 293T cells
(Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) were grown in antibiotic-free
DMEM supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated FBS. All
cell lines were grown in a humidified incubator at 37°C in
an atmosphere of 5% CO2. For experiments where cells
were deprived of serum, cell monolayers were washed

the serum-free DMEM for at least 24 h.

1 h, followed by labeling with [32P] orthophosphate (0.4
mCi/ml) (MB Biomedicals, Solon, OH) for 4 h at 37°C.
The cells were finally lysed in RIPA buffer [50 mM Tris,
pH 7.2; 150 mM NaCl; 1% sodium deoxycholate; 0.1%
SDS; 1% Triton-X 100; 10 mM NaF; 1 mM Na3VO4;
protease inhibitor cocktail (1:1000, Sigma)], followed by
immunoprecipitation with antibodies to mSin1 (sc-48588,
Santa Cruz Biotechnology). The immunoprecipitates
were separated by SDS-PAGE and the gel was dried.
Phosphorylation of mSin1 (32P-labeled mSin1) was
detected by autoradiography. The bands were semiquantified using NIH image J.

Recombinant adenoviral constructs and
infection of cells
The recombinant adenoviruses expressing the
green fluorescence protein (GFP) (Ad-GFP), FLAGtagged rapamycin-resistant and kinase active mTOR
(S2035T, mTOR-T) (Ad-mTOR-T), rapamycin-resistant
and kinase dead mTOR (S2035T/D2357E, mTOR-TE)
(Ad-mTOR-TE), and HA-tagged rapamycin-resistant and
constitutively active mutant of S6K1 (F5A-E389-R3A)
(Ad-S6K1-ca) were generated as described previously [20,
21, 49]. All adenoviruses were amplified, titrated and used
as described [49].

Statistical analysis
Results were expressed as mean values ± standard
error (mean ± S.E.). Statistical analysis was performed
using student t-test or one-way analysis of variance
(ANOVA) followed by post hoc Dunnett’s test for multiple
comparisons. A level of P < 0.05 was considered to be
significant.

Lentiviral shRNA constructs and infection
of cells
To generate lentiviral shRNA to human Akt1,
oligonucleotides containing the target sequences were
synthesized, annealed and inserted into FSIPPW
lentiviral vector via the EcoR1/BamH1 restriction
enzyme site. Oligonucleotides used were: sense,
5′-AATTCCCCGTGAGGCTCCCCTCAACATGCAAGA
GATGTTGAGG GGAGCCTCACGTTTTTG-3′, and
antisense, GATCCAAAAACGTGAGGCTCCCCTCA
ACATCTCTTGCATGTTGAGGGGAGCCTCACGGGG3′. Lentiviral shRNAs to GFP, mTOR, raptor, rictor
and S6K1 were described previously [20]. Lentiviruses
expressing indicated shRNAs were produced and titrated
as described [49]. Cells, when grown to ~70% confluence,
were infected with the above lentiviral shRNAs in the
presence of 8 μg/ml polybrene and exposed to 2 μg/ml
puromycin after 24 h of infection. In 5 days, cells were
used for experiments.
