BACKGROUND. Interferon-alpha (IFN-a) has shown significant activity in the
treatment of BCR-ABL–negative myeloproliferative disorders (MPDs), particularly
essential thrombocythemia (ET) and polycythemia vera (PV). PEG-IFN-a-2b is a
pegylated IFN-a-2b with a significant advantage over nonpegylated form in that
it is administered once a week.

METHODS. Thirty-eight patients with BCR-ABL–negative MPDs were treated with
PEG-IFN-a-2b, given subcutaneously weekly, at the starting dose of 3 lg/kg/wk
for the first 14 patients and then 2 lg/kg/wk for the next 24 patients, with intent
to treat patients as long as they benefited from the therapy.

RESULTS. Median age was 54 years. Patient diagnoses were: 13 (34%) ET; 11
(29%) primary myelofibrosis (PMF); 5 (13%) BCR-ABL–negative chronic myeloid
leukemia (CML); 4 (10.5%) hypereosinophilic syndrome (HES); 4 (10.5%) PV; and
1 (3%) unclassified myeloproliferative disease (uMPD). Recorded grade 3–4 toxicities were related to fatigue, myelosuppression, and musculoskeletal pain. Ten
(26%) patients stopped treatment because of toxicity. Thirteen (34%) patients
achieved a complete remission, and 4 (11%) achieved a partial response. Only
1 patient with PMF responded. Median time to response was 5 months. Median
duration of response was 20 months. Three patients had a sustained response for
>24 months.

CONCLUSIONS. PEG-IFN-a-2b, with proper dose modifications, is effective in controlling disease in a significant proportion of BCR-ABL–negative MPD patients,
particularly ET and PV. However, toxicities encountered with PEG-IFN-a-2b therapy are similar to those obtained with conventional IFN-a, thus limiting the duration of therapy. Cancer 2007;110:2012–8.  2007 American Cancer Society.

he conventional management of patients with high-risk BCRABL–negative myeloproliferative disorders (MPDs) revolves
around the administration of cytoreductive agents such as hydroxyurea, anagrelide, and recombinant human IFN-a.1 IFN-a has
shown significant antitumor and immunomodulatory activity in
BCR-ABL–negative MPDs and has been associated with predictable
decrease in peripheral blood counts, reduction in organomegaly, and
suppression of the abnormal hematopoietic clone.2–6 However, these
benefits are usually attained at the cost of inconvenient treatment
schedules and, in many instances, unacceptable toxicity that hampers timely administration of IFN-a for adequate periods of time,
leading to both lack of efficacy and high dropout rates (25% to 35%

of patients). PEG-IFN-a-2b is produced by attaching
a 12,000-Da monomethoxypolyethylene glycol
(PEG12,000) polymer to the native IFN-a-2b.7 PEG12,000
conjugation increases serum half-life and allows prolonged patient exposure to IFN-a-2b, thus enabling
weekly administration.7–8 Equivalent units of PEGIFN-a-2b and IFN-a-2b have comparable activity in
terms of natural-killer and lymphokine-activated cell
cytolytic activity, induction of the expression of class
I major histocompatibility proteins, and antiviral activity.7,9 Pegylated preparations of IFN-a have been
studied in patients with chronic viral hepatitis and
were found to be more effective than nonpegylated
forms in comparative studies.10–12 We conducted a
phase 2 study of PEG-IFN-a-2b in patients with BCRABL–negative MPDs to determine efficacy and tolerability of this treatment in these patients.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients
Patients were eligible to participate in the current
study if they were diagnosed with 1) essential thrombocythemia characterized by a history of persistent
(>6 months) platelet counts of >600 3 109/L and
hyperplasia of bone marrow megakaryocytes in the
absence of an alternate, identifiable cause; patients
with lower platelet counts were eligible if the platelet
count could be attributed to previous therapy; 2) polycythemia vera with hemoglobin (Hgb) 15 g/dL
(except when a patient was having phlebotomies)
and documented past diagnosis; 3) primary myelofibrosis; and 4) other MPDs (excluding BCR-ABL–positive chronic myeloid leukemia). All previous
treatments had to be completed or discontinued at
least 1 week before the start of PEG-IFN-a-2b, and
patients had to recover from the toxic effects of that
therapy. One exception was the use of hydroxyurea
or anagrelide immediately before study entry that
was allowed to continue for 1 month into PEG-IFNa-2b therapy. Participants were required to have a
ECOG performance status <3, an age >12 years, normal renal and hepatic function (creatinine <2 mg/
dL, total bilirubin <2 mg/dL, and aspartate transaminase [abbreviated as AST or SGOT] or alanine transaminase [abbreviated as ALT or SGPT] <33 upper
normal limits). All patients provided written
informed consent for therapy according to institutional review board guidelines.
Pretreatment evaluation comprised patient history and physical examination; complete blood count
and differential; serum chemistries, including liver
and renal function studies; bone marrow aspiration
and biopsy with cytogenetics; and molecular study for

2013

the presence of the BCR-ABL oncogene. Patients were
followed with physical examination, history, adverse
event assessment, complete blood count, and serum
chemistries, from weekly to monthly until remission
and every 1 month to 2 months thereafter. Thyroid
function tests were repeated every 6 to 12 months.
Bone marrow biopsy was repeated every 3 to 6
months for the first year and then if needed. When it
had been abnormal before therapy, cytogenetic analysis was repeated once during complete remission.

Treatment
PEG-IFN-a-2b was provided in vials containing lyophilized powder, along with sterile water, for injection. At the time of administration, the vial was
reconstituted with 0.7 mL sterile water solution for
the injection to yield 0.74 mL of a 300-mg/mL solution of PEG-IFN-a-2b to be used directly from the
vial. To ensure consistent delivery of the labeled dose
in 0.5 mL, an overfill of 0.2 mL was provided to compensate for residual volume in the vial and in the syringe or needle hub after withdrawal of the needle;
an additional 0.04 mL overfill was added to compensate for the volume displacement by the excipients
during reconstitution of the product. Although the
reconstituted solution is stable for 24 hours when
stored refrigerated between 2–88C, it was recommended to patients that the solution be used within
1 hour of mixing. PEG-IFN-a-2b was administered as
subcutaneous injection by patients themselves once
weekly, for as long as therapy was beneficial. Initially,
the starting dose of PEG-IFN-a-2b was 3 lg/kg/wk.
However, of the first 14 patients on the study, all but
1 had to reduce the dose at least once within the first
3 months, and, therefore, the starting dose was
reduced to 2 lg/kg/wk for the next 24 patients. In
these patients, dose escalation to 3 lg/kg/wk was
allowed for inadequate response and when no toxicity had occurred at 2 lg/kg. A dose reduction to 1.5
and 1.0 lg/kg/wk for persistent grade 2 or grade 3–4
adverse events were allowed.
Response Assessment and Toxicity Criteria
Response and toxicity were evaluated in all patients
who received at least 1 dose of the study drug.
For patients with essential thrombocythemia, a complete remission was defined as normalization of the
peripheral blood platelet count (440 3 109/L). A
partial remission was defined as a reduction of the
initial by 50% without achieving normal levels. For
patients with polycythemia vera, a complete remission was defined as a decrease of Hgb <15 g/dL
without phlebotomy and a disappearance of splenomegaly. A partial remission was defined as a reduc-

tion of phlebotomy requirements by 50% and a 50%
reduction of splenomegaly. For patients with primary
myelofibrosis, a complete remission was defined by
the disappearance of symptoms and signs of the disease, Hgb 11 g/dL, a platelet count 100 3 109/L,
an absolute neutrophil count (ANC) 1.0 3 109/L (in
addition, none of the 3 blood counts was to be higher
than the upper limit of normal), normal differential
count, and normalization of bone marrow with an
osteomyelofibrosis grade no higher than 1; a partial
remission was defined by all the above criteria for
complete remission except the requirement for bone
marrow histologic remission. Clinical improvement in
the absence of both disease progression and complete
or partial remission was defined by 1 of the following
criteria: 1) a minimum 2 g/dL increase in Hgb level,
or transfusion independence (applicable only for
patients with baseline Hgb level <10 g/dL); 2) either a
minimal 50% reduction in palpable splenomegaly of a
spleen that is at least 10 cm at baseline, or a spleen
that is palpable at more than 5 cm at baseline
becomes not palpable; 3) a minimum 100% increase
in platelet count and an absolute platelet count of at
least 50 3 109/L (applicable only for patients with
baseline platelet count below 50 3 109/L); or 4) a
minimum 100% increase in ANC and an ANC of at
least 0.5 3 109/L (applicable only for patients with
baseline ANC below 1 3 109/L). For other MPDs, a
complete remission was defined as normalization for
at least 4 weeks of the bone marrow (<5% blasts) and
peripheral blood with white blood cell count
10 3 109/L, without blasts, promyelocytes, and
myelocytes, in addition to disappearance of all signs
and symptoms of the disease. A partial remission was
similar to a complete remission except for the persistence of immature cells in blood and/or persistent
splenomegaly or thrombocytosis (450 3 109/L) but
at least 50% less than pretreatment. Toxicity
was graded on a scale of 0 to 4 according to the
National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria
Version 2.0.

RESULTS
Patient Characteristics
Between January 2003 and January 2005, 40 patients
were enrolled. Two patients, however, refused therapy before starting and are, therefore, not included
in this report. Clinical characteristics of 38 evaluable
patients are summarized in Table 1. Twenty-five
(66%) were men, and 13 (34%) were women. The
median age was 54 years (range, 28–81 years). Patient
diagnoses were 13 (34%) essential thrombocythemia;
11 (29%) primary myelofibrosis; 5 (13%) BCR-ABL–

and 1 (3%) unclassified myeloproliferative disease.
Twenty (53%) patients had received prior therapy
with hydroxyurea, 18 (47%) with anagrelide, and 3
(8%) had a splenectomy. Ten (26%) patients were
never medically treated. The median time from diagnosis to the start of PEG-IFN-a-2b was 30 months
(range, 1 month to 144 months). The median white
blood cell count before therapy was 16 3 109/L
(range, 2.63 to 39 3 109/L), Hgb 12 g/dL (range,
8–17 g/dL), and platelets 435 3 109/L (range, 213 to
1200 3 109/L). Sixteen (42%) patients had splenomegaly at the start of therapy, and 3 (8%) had cytogenetic abnormality: complex abnormalities, 18 and
19, and deletion 11(q23), in 1 each.

Toxicity
The toxicity profile of the entire patient population is
illustrated in Table 2. Thirty-eight patients were
assessed for toxicity, as 2 did not receive any therapy.
The first 14 patients enrolled started PEG-IFN-a-2b
at 3 lg/kg/wk. However, because of toxicity, all but 1
had to reduce their dose at least once within the first
3 months. Therefore, the study was amended, and all
other patients started at a dose of 2 lg/kg/wk.
Twenty-five (66%) patients experienced grade 3–4
toxicity. The most common grade 3 and 4 nonhema-

grade 3–4 anemia, thrombocytopenia, and neutropenia were observed in, respectively, 2 (5%), 6 (16%),
and 4 (11%) patients. Fifty-five percent of the
patients maintained the 2 lg/kg/wk dose throughout
their time on the therapy. Because of toxicity, 20
(53%) patients had to reduce the dose; median dose
for all patients was 1.5 lg/kg (range, 0.5–2 lg/kg).
Ten (26%) patients discontinued therapy because

weakness and headaches in 1, each). No patient had
signs or symptoms of thrombosis or hemorrhage
while on study.

Response and Duration of Response
After a median follow-up of 27 months (range, 4
months to 42 months), 17 (45%) patients responded
to PEG-IFN-a-2b therapy with 13 (34%) complete
remission and 4 (11%) partial remission. The median
time to response was 5 months (range, 3 months to
21 months), and the median duration of response
was 20 months (range, 3 months to >41 months).
Thirteen responding patients were taken off study
after a median of 19 months (range, 3 months to
42 months). Of theses, 1 patient with essential
thrombocythemia progressed 6 months after achieving a partial remission, 3 (2 essential thrombocythemia, 1 hypereosinophilic syndrome) patients stopped
therapy (because of medical reasons in 2 and
patient’s request in 1), while in complete remission
after a median of 7 months (range, 3 months to 12

2015

months), and 10 (5 essential thrombocythemia, 2
polycythemia vera, 2 BCR-ABL–negative chronic myeloid leukemia, and 1 primary myelofibrosis) were
taken off study because of toxicity, while in a complete (n 5 8) or partial remission (n 5 2) for a median of 24 months (range, 3 months to 42 months).
Three (1 essential thrombocythemia and 2 polycythemia vera) patients sustained ongoing response (2
complete and 1 partial remission), after being on
therapy for >24 months.
Nine of the thirteen (69%) patients with essential
thrombocythemia responded to therapy with 7 (54%)
in complete and 2 (15%) in partial remission. For
patients in complete remission, the level of Hgb
achieved was 12.1 g/dL (range, 11–13.1 g/dL), white
blood cell count 4.6 3 109/L (range, 2.6–7.3 3 109/L),
and the performance status was 0 in 5 and 1 in 2
patients. The median time to response was 5 months
(range, 3 months to 12 months), and the median duration of response was >16 months (range, 6 months
to >41 months). One patient in partial remission
progressed after 6 months, 5 (4 complete remission,
1 partial remission) stopped therapy because of toxicity, and 1 (in complete remission) was still receiving therapy. All 4 patients with polycythemia vera
responded, with 2 complete remission and 2 partial
remission. The median time to response was 8
months (range, 3 months to 21 months), and the median duration of response was 24 months (3 months
to >36 months). Two patients (1 complete remission,
1 partial remission) were taken off study after a median of 31 months (range, 24–38 months) because of
toxicity, and the other 2 had an ongoing response
and remained on therapy. Two of 5 patients with
BCR-ABL–negative chronic myeloid leukemia achieved complete remission after 3 months of therapy.
Their Hgb level was 13 g/dL (range, 11.3 g/dL to
14.6 g/dL), white blood cell count 5.6 3 109/L (range,
2.8 3 109/L to 8.4 3 109/L), and the performance status was 0; neither had organomegaly; bone marrow
normalized in both cases. Both were taken off study
because of toxicity after a median of 37 months
(range, 36–38 months). One of 4 hypereosinophilic
syndrome patients, after 3 months of therapy,
achieved complete remission lasting 6 months; he
had normalization of the blood count and the bone
marrow, with disappearance of a rash. Finally, of the
11 patients with primary myelofibrosis, 1 achieved
complete remission after 3 months of therapy but
lost the response after 24 months. At the time of
this writing, 26 (65%) patients were alive; 3 (8%)
were continuing therapy with ongoing response.

Responses

The goal of this phase 2 study was to determine the
efficacy of PEG-IFN-a-2b in patients with BCR-ABL–
negative MPDs and to evaluate this treatment’s safety
profile. Previously, significant activity of conventional
IFN-a in patients with MPDs,1–7 particularly essential
thrombocythemia and polycythemia vera, has been
demonstrated. Our clinical data showed objective
responses (1 partial remission and 14 complete
remission) in 15 of 20 (75%) essential thrombocythemia patients treated with conventional IFN-a-2b,
where these patients were followed for a median of
14.5 years.13 Among the 14 patients who had a complete remission, 6 patients achieved the resolution of
bone marrow abnormalities in addition to normalization of blood platelet count, and, thus, these patients
were considered to have had a true complete remission (30% of 20 patients). The median time to
response was 6 months (range, 0.5 months to 36
months), and the median response duration was 48
months (range, 5 months to 114 months). However,
the duration of response differed among the complete remission patients as follows: median response
was 99 months (range, 48 months to 114 months) for
patients who normalized bone marrow and 16
months (range, 5 months to 110 months) for patients
who normalized only blood platelet count. Despite
the relatively high response rate, the conventional
IFN-a treatment is considered inconvenient, as the
treatment schedule requires daily injections and
causes grade 2–3 toxicity in approximately 65% of
patients, with an approximate 15% therapy-related
discontinuation rate.13 It was thought that the
improved, patient-friendly, weekly schedule of pegylated IFN-a, compared with conventional IFN-a,10–12
could potentially result in better compliance, lower
toxicity, and higher response rates. In addition, the
results of our pilot study with PEG-IFN-a-2b in 11
patients with essential thrombocythemia14 demonstrated that all patients achieved complete remission
after a median of 4 months of therapy, and the treatment was well tolerated with only 2 patients discontinuing therapy because of toxicity.
Our current study confirmed the efficacy of PEGIFN-a-2b in patients with BCR-ABL–negative MPDs,
with an objective response rate of 45%. Response
rates were higher among patients with essential
thrombocythemia and polycythemia vera, in line with
other phase 2 studies that have assessed the efficacy
of PEG-IFN-a-2b in patients with high-risk essential
thrombocythemia and polycythemia vera. Langer
et al. conducted a phase 2 trial of PEG-IFN-a-2b in 36
high-risk patients with essential thrombocythemia.15

which could be escalated to 150 lg/wk. The complete
remission rate was 67% at 12 months of treatment. After a median duration of 23 months, 23 (64%) patients
were still receiving PEG-IFN-a-2b and 10 (28%) had
stopped therapy because of side effects.15 Similar
results were reported in a large multicenter phase 2
study conducted by the Gruppo Italiano Malattie e
Matologiche dell’Adulto (GIMEMA, Italian Group for
Adult Hematologic Diseases [Rome, Italy]) in 90
patients with high-risk essential thrombocythemia.16
During the first year of therapy, PEG-IFN-a-2b was
given at 25 lg/wk, but could be escalated to 100 lg/
wk, to obtain complete remission. After 12 months of
therapy, 79% of patients were still receiving PEG-IFNa-2b (at a mean value of 50  22 lg/wk), and 64
(71%) had achieved a complete remission. After 24
months, a complete remission was sustained by 75%
of the 64 first-year responders.16 In a phase 2 study
conducted by the Nordic MPD Study Group, PEGIFN-a-2b (initial dose 0.5 lg/kg once weekly) was
given to patients with polycythemia vera (n 5 22) and
essential thrombocythemia (n 5 20).17 At 6 months,
29 (69 %) patients had achieved complete remission,
and 13 were taken off study because of side effects or
insufficient response. At 12 months, 20 (48%) patients
remained as complete remission, but 22 (52%) had
discontinued therapy, mainly because of side effects.
This represented a higher rate than in previous
trials.17 Our study regimen was also associated with
an unexpectedly high rate of side effects, with 25
(66%) patients developing grade 3–4 toxicities. This
was probably because of the design of the study,
where patients were given relatively high doses of
PEG-IFN-a-2b at the start, and then the dose was
decreased if toxicity was seen. Other reported phase 2
studies took the opposite approach, starting with a
low PEG-IFN-a-2b dose and escalating the dose based
on response and tolerance. In our study, however,
with the close monitoring of patients and prompt
dose decrease when needed, the percentage of
patients who stopped therapy because of toxicity was
26% (10 patients), similar to the rate in other phase 2
studies.
The results reported here and in all of the previously published phase 2 studies with PEG-IFN-a-2b
in BCR-ABL–negative MPDs provide reasonable
uncontrolled evidence of comparable efficacy and
tolerance of PEG-IFN-a-2b when compared with conventional IFN-a-2b. Further evidence of a lack of
improvement with PEG-IFN-a-2b over IFN-a-2b therapy was seen in a phase 3 trial conducted by Michallet et al. in patients with BCR-ABL–positive chronic
myeloid leukemia.18 Three hundred forty-four newly
diagnosed BCR-ABL–positive chronic myeloid leuke-

2017

mia patients were randomized between PEG-IFN-a2b or IFN-a. There was no difference between the 2
treatment arms in terms of response rates, as well as
discontinuation rates due to side effects.
PEG-IFN-a-2a is a different type of long-acting
IFN-a, as it is synthesized by conjugating 1 branched
methoxy ethylene glycol molecule to lysine residues
in IFN-a-2a via urethane bonds.19 Although reduced
clearance characterizes both PEG-IFN-a-2b and PEGIFN-a-2a, the main difference is that the former
requires metabolism of PEG molecule via hepatic proteases to be eliminated, and the latter is eliminated
primarily by the kidneys.19 In a rat model, the majority of radioactively labeled PEG-IFN-a-2a was found
intact (no free IFN-a-2a) in major perfused organs,
although at concentrations lower than those found in
blood.
The French ‘‘PV-Nord’’ group performed an openlabel phase 2 study of PEG-IFN-a-2a in patients with
polycythemia vera.20 A recent update of this trial, presented in abstract form, reported results in 32 patients
followed for at least 12 months. At 6 months, 26 (81%)
were in complete remission and 6 (19%) in partial
remission. At 12 months, 2 were off therapy, 27 (84%)
were in complete remission and 3 in partial remission,
for overall response rate of 94%.21 Except for 1 grade 3
skin reaction, there were no other grade 3–4 toxicities.
The median PEG-IFN-a-2a dose received during the
first year was 113 lg/wk (range, 30 lg/wk to 180 lg/
wk). Molecular response (percentage decrease in JAK2
V617V mutation by polymerase chain reaction in DNA
from peripheral blood granulocytes) was observed in
24 of 27 (89%) patients with serial samples, from a
mean percentage JAK2 V617F of 49% to a mean of 27%
(mean decrease of 44%; P < .001), including 1 patient
with no longer detectable mutant JAK2.20,21 These impressive results are in sharp contrast to those obtained
with PEG-IFN-a-2b, in terms of hematologic response
and tolerance, and molecular response.22 Therapy
with PEG-IFN-a-2b was reported to result in only
modest molecular response.23 We have not performed
the molecular testing in this current study because of
lack of sequential samples.
Finally, additional data that suggest good tolerance and improved response rates to PEG-IFN-a-2a
came from the study reported by Lipton et al. This
was a randomized trial that compared PEG-IFN-a-2a
and IFN-a-2a as frontline therapy for patients with
BCR-ABL–positive chronic myeloid leukemia in its
chronic phase.24 Patients treated with PEG-IFN-a-2a
had significantly higher complete hematologic response (66.2% vs 45.2%), major (35.2% vs 17.8%) and
complete (15.5% vs 5.5%) cytogenetic response rates.
Eleven percent of patients treated with PEG-IFN-a-

2a stopped therapy because of toxicity versus 23% in
IFN-a-2a arm.24 Notably, the rates of major cytogenetic response obtained with PEG-IFN-a-2a in the
study by Lipton et al. improved significantly upon
those obtained with PEG-IFN-a-2b as reported by
Michallet et al. in a study with similar design.
In conclusion, findings from the current study
reinforce results from other investigations that evaluated the role of PEG-IFN-a-2b for the treatment of
MPDs, particularly high-risk essential thrombocythemia and polycythemia vera. Modifications in the
pharmacokinetics of IFN-a-2b through the addition
of PEG has enabled its weekly administration. However, the overall results in terms of both efficacy and
tolerance are similar to those obtained with conventional IFN-a. At present, clinical results favor further
study of PEG-IFN-a-2a in MPDs.
