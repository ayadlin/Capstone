Abstract
The WW domain-containing oxidoreductase (WWOX) is a tumor suppressor that is deleted or attenuated in
most human tumors. Wwox-deficient mice develop osteosarcoma (OS), an aggressive bone tumor with poor
prognosis that often metastasizes to lung. On the basis of these observations, we examined the status of
WWOX in human OS specimens and cell lines. In human OS clinical samples, WWOX expression was absent
or reduced in 58% of tumors examined (P < 0.0001). Compared with the primary tumors, WWOX levels frequently increased in tumors resected following chemotherapy. In contrast, tumor metastases to lung often
exhibited reduced WWOX levels relative to the primary tumor. In human OS cell lines having reduced WWOX
expression, ectopic expression of WWOX inhibited proliferation and attenuated invasion in vitro, and suppressed tumorigenicity in nude mice. Expression of WWOX was associated with reduced RUNX2 expression
in OS cell lines, whereas RUNX2 levels were elevated in femurs of Wwox-deficient mice. Furthermore, WWOX
reconstitution in HOS cells was associated with downregulation of RUNX2 levels and RUNX2 target genes,
consistent with the ability of WWOX to suppress RUNX2 transactivation activity. In clinical samples, RUNX2
was expressed in the majority of primary tumors and undetectable in most tumors resected following chemotherapy, whereas most metastases were RUNX2 positive. Our results deepen the evidence of a tumor suppressor role for WWOX in OS, furthering its prognostic and therapeutic significance in this disease. Cancer Res;

Introduction
The WW domain-containing oxidoreductase (WWOX) gene
encodes a 46-kDa tumor suppressor that is altered in most
human cancers (1, 2). WWOX spans the second most active
common fragile site, FRA16D, frequently involved in cancer

(3, 4). Loss of heterozygosity (LOH), homozygous deletions
(HD), hypermethylation, and chromosomal translocations affecting WWOX have been reported in many malignancies.
WWOX inactivation has been associated with more aggressive tumors and with poor prognosis (2, 5, 6). Recently, we
have generated a targeted ablation of the Wwox gene in mice
(7). Analysis of Wwox-mutant mice shows a bona fide tumor
suppressor function of WWOX. More than 30% of Wwoxdeficient juvenile mice develop periosteal osteosarcomas
(OS; ref. 7). Importantly, molecular characterization of these
tumors identifies RUNX2 as a partner of WWOX (8).
RUNX2 is an essential transcription factor for bone formation, and accumulative data have shown that its levels are
upregulated in many malignancies, including OS and metastatic breast and prostate cancers (9–14). Our recent findings
show that WWOX physically associates with RUNX2 and
functionally suppresses its transactivating function in osteoblasts and in neoplastic cells (8). Furthermore, analysis of
Runx2 mRNA expression in femurs of Wwox-deficient mice
revealed its significant upregulation (8), suggesting that
WWOX may regulate RUNX2 levels. Interestingly, osteoblasts
isolated from Wwox-deficient mice exhibit an autonomous
defect in differentiation (8).
OS is the most common primary malignant bone tumor in
childhood and adolescence (15). This highly aggressive tumor

usually involves long bones and frequently metastasizes to
the lungs. Little is known of the etiology of OS and lesser still
of the various interactions that occur between host and tumor cells to regulate the growth and progression of OS
in vivo. OS is genetically heterogeneous, marked by multiple
random chromosomal aberrations with only a few recurring
deletions and amplifications (16, 17). Recently, it has been
shown that mice with osteoblast-restricted loss of p53 and
Rb uniformly develop OS (18). Molecular analyses of OS have
also revealed alterations in transforming growth factor-β/
bone morphogenetic protein, Wnt/β-catenin, and cell
cycle–related pathways (10, 19–21). RUNX2 levels are increased in human OS (10, 12–14); however, the cause of this
elevation is not known. Molecular markers predictive of OS
tumor progression, metastasis, and response to chemotherapy
are lacking, preventing development of more biologically tailored therapies for high-risk patients.
Here, we report immunohistochemical studies of WWOX
and RUNX2 expression in a series of human OS samples
recovered as biopsies from untreated primary tumors, bulk
resections following chemotherapy, and excised metastases.
We also describe the effect of overexpressing WWOX in
human and in murine OS cell lines on the proliferation,
migration, and invasion in vitro of the cell lines and on
their xenograft growth in nude mice. Our findings suggest
that reduction of WWOX expression is a common event in
human OS and that its expression could serve as a
prognostic and therapeutic indicator for assessing OS
progression.

per group; Charles River Laboratories). Five control mice
were injected with 107 uninfected cells. Animals were monitored daily, and tumor sizes were measured every 5 days. At
the end point (day 28), animals were sacrificed, tumors were
weighed, and tumor volumes were calculated as previously
described (22).
Immunohistochemistry
Human OS tissue sections were obtained following Institutional Review Board approval. For each tumor, immunohistochemistry was performed on one representative formalin-fixed,
paraffin-embedded section chosen by review of the H&Estained slides. Polyclonal anti-WWOX antibody (1:5,000 dilution; ref. 23) or monoclonal anti-RUNX2 antibody (1:100
dilution; ref. 12) was used. Immunohistochemical staining
and scoring of WWOX and RUNX2 staining were determined
by at least two pathologists. For WWOX, tumors were grouped
into three categories (strong, reduced, and absent) based on
the intensity of cytoplasmic staining in all tumor cells present
on the slides. The “strong” category was assigned when the
intensity was equivalent to that found in osteoblasts and
chondrocytes from healthy tissues. The “reduced” category
was used for tumors with clearly diminished intensity, and
the “absent” category for tumors with no WWOX immunostaining. When present, osteoblasts in reactive bone surrounding tumors and chondrocytes in bronchial cartilage served as
internal positive controls. Nuclear RUNX2 staining was scored
as either positive or negative. Tumors with only scattered
RUNX2-positive cells (<2% of all tumor cells) were considered
negative.

Materials and Methods
Cell lines and cell culture
OS-derived cell lines were obtained from the American
Type Culture Collection; human MG-63 cell line was a gift
from Prof. Zvi Bar Shavit (Hebrew University), and MLOY4
cells were received from Prof. Linda Bonewald (University
of Kansas). Cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 supplemented
with 10% fetal bovine serum.
In vitro viral transduction
The WWOX adenovirus transduction has been previously
described (22). Ad-GFP virus served as a control. Cells were
transduced with Ad-WWOX or Ad-GFP at appropriate multiplicities of infection (MOI), and transduction efficiency was
assessed by visualization of green fluorescent protein (GFP)–
expressing cells. To generate a lentiviral WWOX vector,
human WWOX cDNA was cloned in lentiviral vector containing neomycin as the selection marker (gift from Dr. Ittai
Ben-Porath, Hebrew University) using the Gateway cloning
system (Invitrogen).
In vivo studies
Animal studies were done under an approved protocol according to institutional guidelines. KHOS, HOS, and K7M2 OS
cells were infected with Ad-WWOX or Ad-GFP at a MOI of
100. Twenty-four hours after infection, 107 cells were injected
s.c. into the flanks of 6-week-old female nude mice (five mice

Results
High incidence of OS in Wwox-deficient mice
We previously reported that ∼30% of Wwox-deficient mice
developed spontaneous OS (7). This incidence was based on
sections through paraffin-embedded bone. Because only few
serial slides contain tumor, we developed a screening
approach using a more sensitive detection method by
micro–computed tomography (μCT) imaging of intact limbs
(Supplementary Fig. S1A). Irregular protrusions on the endosteal or periosteal sides of the cortex seen on μCT were then
subjected to histologic assessment (Supplementary Fig. S1B).
Using this approach, 100% of Wwox-deficient mice had developed OS by 18 days of age and 68% of mice had bilateral involvement (Supplementary Table S1). These new findings
strengthen the hypothesis that WWOX deficiency can contribute to human OS.

Frequent alteration of WWOX expression in human OS
To assess the clinical significance of WWOX protein
expression in human OS, 83 OS samples from 51 patients
(Supplementary Table S2) were analyzed by immunohistochemistry and compared with 12 normal bone and cartilage
tissues (Table 1A). These included 34 pretreatment biopsies,
34 posttreatment resections, and 15 posttreatment metastasis resections. Representative examples of OS with normal,
reduced, and absent WWOX immunoreactivity are shown
in Fig. 1A. WWOX expression was uniformly strong in the cytoplasm of the 12 normal bone and cartilage specimens (Supplementary Fig. S2; Fig. 1A). In OS specimens, strong WWOX
expression was detected in 42% (35 of 83), whereas 58% (48 of
83) exhibited absent or reduced (grouped as Altered) WWOX
immunoreactivity (P < 0.0001; Table 1A). These data indicate
that WWOX expression is significantly altered in OS tumors
compared with normal bone.
WWOX expression following chemotherapy
After biopsy diagnosis, OS is treated with a chemotherapeutic induction regimen of cisplatin, doxorubicin, and
high-dose methotrexate before surgical resection (24). To determine the effect of chemotherapy on WWOX expression,
the immunohistochemical expression of WWOX was compared in pretreatment biopsies and posttreatment resection
specimens from 16 OS patients. WWOX expression increased
in 44% (7 of 16) of the paired samples, 5 of which were initially WWOX negative (95% CI, 19.75–70.12; Fig. 1B; Supplementary Table S3). Another 44% (7 of 16) of the paired
samples showed no change in WWOX; however, all expressed
WWOX in the pretreatment biopsies. WWOX decreased in

www.aacrjournals.org

postchemotherapy specimens in 22% (2 of 16) of the paired
samples. These results suggest that chemotherapy, which
induces tumor cell normalization, is accompanied by restoration of WWOX expression. Interestingly, all samples
where WWOX increased had a poor response to chemotherapy (<90% necrosis), whereas 67% of the remaining
paired samples had a favorable response (Supplementary
Table S4).
WWOX expression in metastatic lesions
Because OS frequently metastasizes, we determined whether WWOX expression in metastases was different than in primary OS by comparing immunohistochemical expression in
paired samples from nine patients who had a pretreatment
OS biopsy and a posttreatment metastasectomy. Nearly half
(four of nine) of paired specimens showed reduced or absent
WWOX expression in the metastasis compared with the primary tumor (95% CI, 13.70–78.80; Fig. 1C; Supplementary
Table S5). WWOX levels were unchanged in three of the
paired samples (two already had reduced WWOX levels in
the primary tumor), whereas two metastases exhibited higher WWOX expression compared with the primary tumor.
These results suggest that decreased WWOX levels are
associated with a more aggressive tumor cell at the metastatic site.
WWOX expression in OS cell lines
To determine the expression of WWOX in OS cells, we examined mRNA levels and protein expression in five human
and three mouse OS cell lines. Four human OS cell lines
(MG-63, KHOS, SAOS2, and HOS) exhibited significantly lower

was comparable with MDA-MB-231 cells, a breast cancer cell
line that expresses very low levels of WWOX (25). By contrast,
Wwox mRNA expression in the K7M2 mouse OS cell line was
comparable with mouse bone marrow, MC3T3, and MLOY4
normal osteocytes (Fig. 2B). Protein expression was barely detected in the four human cell lines compared with MCF-7
cells, which express abundant WWOX (Fig. 2C). The K7M2
mouse OS cells exhibited comparable WWOX protein levels
with the mouse preosteoblastic MC3T3 cells (Fig. 2C). These
results indicate that WWOX expression is altered in most human OS cells.

Effects of WWOX overexpression on OS proliferation,
apoptosis, and tumorigenicity
Because four of five human OS cell lines exhibited low
endogenous WWOX expression, we determined whether
overexpressing WWOX would alter their growth. We overexpressed WWOX in three OS cell lines using Ad-WWOX
(22) or Ad-GFP at a MOI of 100. Immunoblot analysis 72 hours
after infection confirmed WWOX overexpression in all AdWWOX–infected cells (Fig. 3A). Next, we measured cell
proliferation by the 2,3-bis[2-methoxy-4-nitro-5-sulfophenyl]2H-tetrazolium-5-carboxanilide inner salt (XTT) assay. Two
OS cell lines (KHOS and HOS) that have very low endogenous
WWOX levels exhibited reduced proliferation following
Ad-WWOX infection compared with Ad-GFP infection

WWOX Expression in Human Osteosarcoma

(Fig. 3B). In contrast, K7M2 cells, which endogenously express
higher levels of WWOX, had no change in proliferation
following WWOX overexpression (Fig. 3B).
Previous studies have shown that ectopic WWOX expression promotes apoptosis (22). We therefore used propidium
iodide and flow cytometry to assess whether WWOX overexpression induces apoptosis in the OS cell lines. A sub-G1 population was present in Ad-WWOX infected in KHOS and HOS
cells but not in K7M2 cells (Supplementary Fig. S3). At 72
hours after Ad-WWOX infection (MOI, 100), but not after
Ad-GFP infection, the sub-G1 fraction was increased ∼6-fold
in KHOS cells and ∼3-fold in HOS cells.
We next measured tumorigenicity of OS cells infected with
Ad-WWOX or Ad-GFP by inoculating nude mice with 1 × 107
cells. At 28 days after injection, three of five and two of five
mice inoculated with Ad-WWOX–infected HOS cells and
KHOS cells, respectively, displayed no tumors, whereas all
Ad-GFP–infected mice had tumors (data not shown). The average volume of tumors at day 28 after inoculation with
Ad-WWOX–infected cells showed significant suppression of
tumor growth in KHOS and HOS cells, but not in WWOXpositive K7M2 cells, compared with tumors from Ad-GFP
treatment (Fig. 3C).
WWOX expression affects OS progression
Because OS cells often metastasize, we used lentiviral vectors to generate stable clones of HOS and KHOS cells expres-

sing WWOX or empty vector (EV) and then measured their
proliferation and cell migration characteristics. HOS-WWOX
and KHOS-WWOX stable clones had increased WWOX expression compared with HOS-EV and KHOS-EV clones
(Fig. 4A; Supplementary Fig. S5A). We performed XTT, colony
formation, and soft agar assays and found that HOS-WWOX
and KHOS-WWOX cells had reduced proliferation, survival,
and anchorage-independent cell growth compared with
HOS-EV and KHOS-EV clones and their respective parental
cell lines (Fig. 4B; Supplementary Figs. S4 and S5).
HOS-WWOX cells had low cell motility compared with
HOS-EV and HOS cells in a wound-healing assay (Fig. 4C).
In a Matrigel invasion assay, HOS-EV clones behaved similar
to HOS cells, whereas HOS-WWOX cells exhibited reduced invasiveness (Fig. 4D). Similar results were observed when
KHOS-WWOX stable clones were compared with KHOS-EV
clones (Supplementary Fig. S5).
Loss of WWOX expression is associated with elevated
RUNX2 levels in several OS cell lines
We reported recently that WWOX suppresses the transactivation function of RUNX2 (8); therefore, we set out to determine whether WWOX tumor suppressor function in OS is
associated with elevated levels of RUNX2. First, we examined
RUNX2 in femurs of Wwox-deficient mice and found elevated
immunohistochemical levels of RUNX2 compared with wildtype littermate control mice (Supplementary Fig. S6). Next, by

WWOX mRNA relative expression
in human (A) and mouse (B) OS cell

protein expression.

Western blot analysis in cell lines, we also found an inverse
correlation between levels of WWOX and RUNX2 in several
lines (Fig. 5A). The breast cancer cell line MCF-7 has high levels of WWOX and absent RUNX2, whereas WWOX levels are
low and RUNX2 is expressed in the highly metastatic cell line
MDA-MB-231. Similarly, murine cell lines MC3T3 and K7M2
express WWOX and have reduced RUNX2 expression, whereas human OS cell lines HOS, SAOS2, and KHOS have reduced
WWOX expression and elevated RUNX2 expression. Interestingly, the inverse correlation between WWOX and RUNX2
was not observed in two less differentiated OS cell lines,
MG-63 and U2OS. Importantly, overexpression of WWOX in
the lentivirus-transduced HOS-WWOX cells caused a significant reduction in RUNX2 mRNA and protein as assessed by
quantitative reverse transcription-PCR (qRT-PCR) and Western blot (Fig. 5B and C). Similarly, downstream target genes of
RUNX2, matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP9), type I collagen
(COL1A1), and, to a lesser extent, osteocalcin (OC), showed
marked downregulation in HOS-WWOX cells compared with
HOS-EV cells (Fig. 5B). These data suggest that WWOX expression may contribute to OS formation, at least in part,
through regulating RUNX2 expression.
Aberrant RUNX2 expression in human OS
Because the majority of human OS examined express elevated levels of RUNX2 (10, 14), and our findings showed that
WWOX expression is attenuated in OS, we tested whether
WWOX and RUNX2 expression are inversely correlated in human OS specimens. Immunohistochemical analyses of 56 of
our OS cases (Supplementary Table S2) revealed that 60%
(12 of 20) of pretreatment biopsies were positive for RUNX2
(Table 1B). Only 16% (4 of 25) of posttreatment resections

5582

Cancer Res; 70(13) July 1, 2010

were positive for RUNX2, indicating that the majority of resected samples had lost this highly metastatic marker. Paired
pretreatment biopsy and posttreatment resections were
available for 12 OS patients. Eight of the biopsies were
RUNX2 positive and all (100%) became RUNX2 negative after
treatment, whereas one in four of the biopsies that were
RUNX2 negative became RUNX2 positive after treatment
(Supplementary Tables S4 and S6), suggesting a poor outcome. A similar comparison was performed using paired pretreatment biopsies and resected metastases from seven OS
patients. Interestingly, among the seven patients for whom
pretreatment biopsies and metastasectomy specimens were
available, all pretreatment biopsies were RUNX2 positive and
five remained RUNX2 positive in the metastases (Supplementary Table S7), consistent with poor prognosis.
Although WWOX and RUNX2 results suggested an inverse association in human OS, this was not evident when
paired comparisons were performed on the 56 available
cases (Supplementary Table S8). In pretreatment biopsies,
78% (seven of nine) of WWOX strong tumors were also
RUNX2 positive. In WWOX reduced or absent biopsies,
55% (6 of 11) were also RUNX2 negative. Evaluation of both
WWOX and RUNX2 levels following chemotherapy revealed
that, of the 6 of 12 patients with increased WWOX following chemotherapy, 3 (50%) had a concomitant decrease in
RUNX2. Two others were RUNX2 negative in both biopsy
and resection such that 83% (five of six) of posttreatment
specimens with increased WWOX were RUNX2 negative
(Supplementary Table S4). Two of the three metastases with
decreased WWOX also had decreased RUNX2 despite findings that most of the metastases are RUNX2 positive (Supplementary Table S9).

WWOX Expression in Human Osteosarcoma

Discussion
We find that WWOX expression is absent or reduced in
58% of OS patient specimens (P < 0.0001) and in the majority
of human OS cell lines. In some OS patients, chemotherapy
restored WWOX levels and the metastases had reduced levels. The observed alterations in WWOX expression were
accompanied, at least in part, by aberrant RUNX2 expression,
a factor known to be expressed in OS (10, 14). Our data also
revealed that WWOX expression suppresses tumorigenicity
both in vitro and in vivo in nude mice and that ectopic
WWOX expression diminishes tumor progression of
metastatic OS cell lines. These findings provide the first evidence that WWOX expression is clinically and therapeutically significant in OS.
Consistent with other types of human cancer (1, 2, 5), we
observed that a significant proportion of OS samples exhibited either markedly reduced (41%) or absent (17%) WWOX
expression (Fig. 1; Table 1A). WWOX protein and mRNA
levels are significantly reduced in many human OS cell lines
compared with control cells (Fig. 2). Previous studies have
shown that hypermethylation of the regulatory region of
WWOX is associated with low or absent protein expression
(5); however, we could not confirm this in OS cell lines (data
not shown). Alteration of WWOX in cancer has also been
shown to be associated with LOH, HD, and enhanced protein
degradation (5). Tumor suppressor genes at common fragile
sites are frequently inactivated early in neoplastic progression (26). It is thus possible that inactivation of WWOX
could occur during the extensive proliferation necessary for
early bone growth, contributing to development of OS in
childhood.

Because loss of WWOX results in OS formation in mice
(ref. 7; Supplementary Fig. S1), and reduced levels are present
in human OS cell lines and tissues, we determined whether
ectopic expression of WWOX could reverse malignancy. In
restoring WWOX expression in two WWOX-reduced OS cell
lines by infection with Ad-WWOX, we observed a decreased
tumorigenicity in vitro, as indicated by reduced proliferation
(Fig. 3B) and increased apoptosis (Supplementary Fig. S3),
and in vivo, as indicated by marked reduction of tumor
growth in immunocompromised mice (Fig. 3C). Thus, ectopic expression of WWOX in OS cells can potentially reverse
malignant properties despite other cancer-associated genetic
alterations that have accumulated in these cell lines. Decreased tumorigenicity was not observed in K7M2 OS cells
that express WWOX, suggesting that WWOX overexpression
may not affect the cellular phenotype in WWOX-sufficient cells.
We previously showed that WWOX, via its first WW domain, associates with RUNX2 and suppresses its transactivation of the OC promoter (8). Increased RUNX2 levels have
been reported in human OS (10, 12–14). Our data show that
RUNX2 protein and mRNA levels were also high in femurs of
Wwox-deficient mice and in some OS cell lines with low endogenous levels of WWOX, suggesting an inverse correlation
with WWOX (Supplementary Fig. S6; ref. 8). RUNX2 autoregulatory mechanisms have been described in osteoblasts
(27, 28), and several lines of evidence indicate that RUNX2
expression is regulated by different tumor suppressors and
oncoproteins implicated in the pathogenesis of OS, including
pRb, p53, and MDM2 (18, 29, 30). Additionally, WW domaincontaining proteins such as YAP (31) and the potent activator TAZ (32) interact with the same protein domain as
WWOX. Therefore, it is possible that when WWOX is absent,

reduced, or nonfunctional, other WW domain-containing
proteins may regulate RUNX2 transcription, contributing to
its increased levels in OS.
In human OS samples, we found that 60% of prechemotherapy OS biopsies were RUNX2 positive (Table 1B). Interestingly, when paired comparisons were performed on 56
human OS samples, an inverse relationship between WWOX
and RUNX2 was not evident (Supplementary Table S8). More
than half of WWOX altered primary tumors were also RUNX2
negative, and ∼80% that were WWOX strong were also
RUNX2 positive. The strong inverse relationship found in vitro
may reflect ex vivo selection of WWOX altered cell lines due
to their enhanced growth properties, although we did observe
an inverse correlation in vivo in Wwox-deficient mice. It is
possible that the immunohistochemistry performed on fixed
human tissue samples lacked the sensitivity to detect
changes in WWOX and RUNX2 expression seen by qRTPCR assays and Western blots, performed on cell lines. Alternatively, the relationship between WWOX and RUNX2 may

5584

be more complex in vivo, in part due to multiple additional
aberrations that occur in the tumors. Support for this latter
hypothesis is found in the less differentiated cell lines, which
showed both WWOX and RUNX2 expression to be either reduced (MG-63) or preserved (U2OS; Fig. 5A). An expanded
study will be required to explore this aberrant relationship
in human OS.
After tumor staging, the most important predictor of disease-free survival in OS is responsiveness to chemotherapy.
Ninety percent or greater tumor necrosis at resection (good
response) is associated with a more favorable prognosis. Currently, there are no molecular markers to further stratify the
poor responding patients for additional therapy (33–35). We
examined WWOX immunoreactivity in paired biopsy and resection specimens and found that in nearly half of postchemotherapy resections, WWOX expression was increased
(Supplementary Table S3). None of the resections having increased WWOX expression had high (>90%) rates of tumor
necrosis. At present, our sample size is too small to assess

the significance of this observation. However, we speculate
that WWOX expression might serve as another predictor of
tumors with favorable and less favorable prognoses (Supplementary Table S4).
Metastasis, a hallmark of malignancy (36), is found in up to
20% of patients with OS at initial diagnosis and is associated
with a poor prognosis (33, 35). Our analysis revealed that
nearly half of metastases had reduced or absent levels of
WWOX compared with their primary tumor (Supplementary
Table S5). We also showed that stable restoration of WWOX
in metastatic HOS and KHOS cell lines inhibited anchorageindependent growth and colony formation (Fig. 4), and
reduced migration and Matrigel invasion in vitro (Fig. 4; Supplementary Fig. S5), suggesting that loss of WWOX expression might be associated with development of metastases.
Intriguingly, the majority of OS cases experienced a loss of
RUNX2 following chemotherapy (Supplementary Tables S4
and S6). Nearly all cases where WWOX increased following
chemotherapy were also RUNX2 negative, suggesting a normalization of the WWOX-RUNX2 relationship with chemotherapy. Another significant outcome of our study is that
the majority of metastatic tumors expressed RUNX2 (Supplementary Tables S7 and S8), consistent with its oncogenic
potential (9). Similar to the primary tumors, an inverse relationship was not found between WWOX and RUNX2 in most
resections and metastases. It is possible that failure to restore the inverse relationship between WWOX and RUNX2
levels with chemotherapy identifies cases with an inherent
predisposition toward metastasis. Larger case series will be
necessary to evaluate whether assessing WWOX and RUNX2
expression will be a useful prognostic tools in OS.
In conclusion, WWOX expression is lost or reduced in a
large portion of human OS and seems accompanied by an

aberrant relationship with RUNX2. Ectopic expression of
WWOX in human OS cells suppressed cancer cell growth, diminished migration and invasion in vitro, and suppressed xenograft tumor growth. Tumors that increased WWOX levels
and lost RUNX2 expression following chemotherapy had
poor necrosis responses, suggesting that a subset of poor responders may have improved prognosis due to tumor cell
normalization. This normalization was not found in metastases, which largely retained patterns seen in the primary tumors despite chemotherapy. Our findings suggest potential
prognostic value in examining WWOX and RUNX2 in OS
patients.
