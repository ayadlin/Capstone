SUMMARY
Here, we have investigated the role of the Notch pathway in the generation and maintenance of
KrasG12V-driven non-small cell lung carcinomas (NSCLCs). We demonstrate by genetic means
that -secretase and RBPJ are essential in the formation of NSCLCs. Importantly, pharmacologic
treatment of mice carrying autochthonous NSCLCs with a -secretase inhibitor (GSI) blocks
cancer growth. Treated carcinomas present reduced HES1 levels and, interestingly, reduced
phosphorylated ERK without changes in phosphorylated MEK. Mechanistically, we show that
HES1 directly binds and represses the promoter of DUSP1, encoding a dual phosphatase active
against phospho-ERK. Accordingly, GSI treatment upregulates DUSP1 and decreases phosphoERK. These data provide proof for the in vivo therapeutic potential of -secretase inhibitors in
primary NSCLCs.

INTRODUCTION
Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths in the world. A major challenge in
treating lung cancer is to find novel therapeutic targets that could complement current
chemotherapy.

The Notch pathway is highly complex and regulates among other processes embryonic
development, cell fate decisions and tissue homeostasis, and it has been implicated in a
variety of human diseases including cancer (Chiba, 2006; Demarest et al., 2008; Ferrando,
2009; Hass et al., 2009; Roy et al., 2007). Briefly, this pathway involves a total of five
activatory ligands, four NOTCH receptors, sequential proteolytic processing of the ligandbound receptors to generate active Notch intracellular domains (NICDs), and formation of
DNA binding complexes with a number of DNA binding partners, being RBPJ the most
important and the one that defines the so-called “canonical” Notch pathway (Chiba, 2006;
Demarest et al., 2008; Ferrando, 2009; Heitzler, 2010; Roy et al., 2007). In turn, NICDcontaining DNA bound complexes activate the expression of a number of effectors,
including the transcriptional repressor HES1 (Sang et al., 2010).
The -secretase complex is essential for the Notch pathway because it is responsible for the
activation of NOTCH receptors by proteolytic cleaveage (Hass et al., 2009). This complex is
formed by the assembly of four protein subunits, namely, a presenilin subunit (PSEN1 or
PSEN2), nicastrin (NCSTN), APH1 and PSNEN (Fraering, 2007). The proteolytic activity
of the -secretase complex resides within the presenilin subunit although each of the four
subunits is essential for the formation of a functional -secretase complex (Fraering, 2007).
In this regard, we have recently demonstrated that combined deletion of the two presenilin
genes Psen1 and Psen2 results in ablation of NOTCH1 activation in T-cells (Maraver et al.,
2007). Additionally, small molecule inhibitors targeting the -secretase complex (known as
GSIs for -secretase inhibitors) have been developed (Wolfe, 2009) and phenocopy Notch
pathway inhibition in mouse models (van Es et al., 2005; Wong et al., 2004).

The oncogenic role of the Notch pathway is well established in T-cell acute lymphoblastic
leukemias (T-ALL), where NOTCH1 is oncogenically mutated in about 60% of leukemias
(Ferrando, 2009). Previous investigators have reported a number of alterations in the Notch
pathway in human non-small cell lung carcinomas (NSCLCs), including NOTCH3
overexpression (Haruki et al., 2005), loss of expression of NUMB (Westhoff et al., 2009), a
negative regulator of the Notch pathway, and activating mutations in NOTCH1 (Westhoff et
al., 2009). Previous reports have also demonstrated that GSIs induce apoptosis in human
lung cancer cells grown in vitro (Chen et al., 2007; Eliasz et al., 2010; Westhoff et al., 2009)
and slow the growth of subcutaneous xenografts formed by human lung cancer cells
(Konishi et al., 2007; Luistro et al., 2009; Paris et al., 2005). However, little is known about
the activity of GSIs on primary autochthonous NSCLCs in their natural environment, or
about the mechanisms by which GSIs could exert their antitumoral effect on NSCLCs.
In mice, inducible genetic activation of a latent Kras oncogenic allele in the lung initiates a
stepwise tumorigenic process that culminates in NSCLCs highly similar to those in humans,
sharing a common histology (Guerra et al., 2003; Jackson et al., 2001) and a common
transcriptional profile (Sweet-Cordero et al., 2005). Here, we have used this mouse model to
analyze the effect of the Notch pathway in the development of NSCLCs.

RESULTS
The Notch pathway is hyperactive in murine KrasG12V-driven NSCLC

Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts

The Notch pathway is hyperactive in a subset of human non-small cell lung carcinomas
(NSCLCs) (Westhoff et al., 2009). Based on this, we wanted to know if this was the case in
murine KrasG12V-driven adenocarcinomas, which is a frequent type of NSCLCs (Guerra et
al., 2003). All the analyzed murine NSCLCs presented significantly higher levels of Notch1
intracellular domain (NICD) and Hes1 compared to normal lung (Figure 1A). To evaluate
the levels of -secretase, we measured the abundance of the active forms of presenilin 1
(PSEN1) and nicastrin (NCSTN). In the case of PSEN1, assembly into the -secretase
complex is associated to a proteolytic cleavage (Fraering, 2007). We observed higher levels
of the carboxy-terminal fragment of PSEN1 (PSEN1-CTF) in murine NSCLCs compared to
normal lung (Figure 1A), while the levels of Psen1 mRNA were unchanged (Figure S1A).
These results agree with a previous observation in human fibroblasts cultured in vitro where
ectopic overexpression of oncogenic HRAS was found to increase PSEN1 protein levels
without affecting its mRNA levels (Weijzen et al., 2002). In the case of NCSTN, its
assembly into the -secretase complex is associated to glycosylation and a slower
elecretrophoretic mobility (Edbauer et al., 2002). As it was the case of PSEN1, we also
observed higher levels of mature NCSTN in murine NSCLCs (Figure S1B). These
observations indicate higher levels of functional -secretase complex in murine KrasG12Vdriven NSCLCs.

To define the kinetics of Notch pathway activation during lung tumorigenesis, we tested the
expression of HES1 by immunohistochemistry in murine lesions at different stages, from
grade 1 to 4 (grades 1 to 3 corresponding to adenomas and grade 4 to adenocarcinomas)
(Jackson et al., 2005). Interestingly, we observed a direct association between tumor grade
and HES1 nuclear signal, which reached its maximum in grade 4 (adenocarcinomas) lesions
(Figures 1B and 1C; Figure S1C). As an internal control, we also observed strong nuclear
expression of HES1 in murine bronchioles (Collins et al., 2004; Ito et al., 2000; Morimoto et
al.; Tsao et al., 2009) (Figure S1C). Finally, we found lower levels of expression of Numb
mRNA (Figure 1D), a negative regulator of the Notch pathway whose expression is also
diminished in human NSCLC (Westhoff et al., 2009). Together, these data indicate that
murine KrasG12V-driven NSCLCs faithfully recapitulate the activation of the Notch pathway
reported in human NSCLCs and validates this mouse lung cancer model for analyzing
therapeutic strategies and mechanisms related to the Notch pathway.
The γ-secretase complex is needed for KrasG12V-driven NSCLC
To evaluate the relevance of the Notch pathway in lung tumorigenesis, we combined a Creinducible KrasG12V oncogenic allele (KrasLSLG12Vgeo) (Guerra et al., 2003) and
Psen1f/f;Psen2−/− alleles (i.e. Psen1 flanked by loxP sites excisable by Cre recombinase, and
Psen2 null) (Saura et al., 2004), thus generating compound
Kras+/LSLG12Vgeo;Psen1f/f;Psen2−/− animals. These mice were treated with intra-tracheal
delivery of adeno-Cre (for brevity, the resulting lungs are referred to here as KrasV12/
PSKO). Control mice Kras+/LSLG12Vgeo;Psen1+/+;Psen2+/+ were derived from the same set
of crosses as the Kras+/LSLG12Vgeo;Psen1f/f;Psen2−/− mice and, for brevity, we refer to the
adeno-Cre treated lungs as KrasV12/WT lungs. Mice were sacrificed between 5.5 and 7.5
months post-adeno-Cre delivery and lung tumors were graded and quantified (Figure 2A).
Most tumors in control KrasV12/WT lungs had progressed to grades 3 and 4, while, in the
case of KrasV12/PSKO lungs, there was no progression beyond grade 1 (Figure 2A). We
also measured the percentage of animals with at least one grade 4 tumor (i.e.
adenocarcinoma). Importantly, while 44% of KrasV12/WT lungs presented
adenocarcinomas, none of the KrasV12/PSKO lungs developed NSCLCs (Figure 2B).

The canonical Notch pathway is needed for KrasG12V-driven NSCLC

Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts

After having established the importance of the -secretase complex for the generation of
KrasG12V-driven NSCLC, we wanted to test directly the implication of the canonical Notch
pathway. For this, we generated compound mice carrying the Cre-inducible KrasG12V
oncogenic allele in combination with a floxed allele of Rbpj (Rbpjf/f) (Tanigaki et al., 2002).
These mice, together with their corresponding controls, were treated with intra-tracheal
delivery of adeno-Cre (for brevity, KrasV12/RbpjKO or KrasV12/WT, respectively). It
should be noted that in this experiment the batch of adeno-Cre was more active than in the
previous experiment (see Experimental Procedures), thus yielding a higher number of
tumors per mouse. As it happened in KrasV12/PSKO mice, in the case of KrasV12/RbpjKO
mice, grade 4 tumors (adenocarcinomas) were absent 5.5-7.5 months post-adeno-Cre
delivery (Figures 3A and 3B). We wondered whether the grade 3 tumors present in
KrasV12/RbpjKO mice had actually deleted the Rbpj gene or, alternatively, were nondeleted Rbpj-floxed tumors (“escapers”). For this, we microdissected grade 3 tumors (n=3)
and we observed that all of them were “escapers” (Figure S2). Taking together, our genetic
analyses indicate that the Notch pathway is essential for NSCLC formation driven by
KrasG12V.
Pharmacological inhibition of γ-secretase arrests KrasG12V-driven NSCLCs

Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts

Having demonstrated that -secretase is highly relevant for lung tumorigenesis, and that the
Notch pathway is strongly active in lung cancer, we set out a preclinical assay to test the
impact of -secretase inhibition in primary NSCLCs. Previous reports have demonstrated
that small molecule inhibitors of the -secretase pathway (generally known as GSIs) induce
apoptosis in lung cancer cells grown in vitro (Chen et al., 2007; Eliasz et al., 2010; Westhoff
et al., 2009) and slow the growth of subcutaneous xenografts formed by lung cancer cells
(Konishi et al., 2007; Luistro et al., 2009; Paris et al., 2005). However, nothing is known
about the impact of GSIs on autochthonous primary NSCLCs, i.e. in their natural
microenvironment. For this, we took advantage of compound LSN-411575 (Wong et al.,
2004). This compound has been well validated in rodents (Best et al., 2005; Wong et al.,
2004) and it is among the most potent GSIs (Wolfe, 2009). To test the therapeutic potential
of LSN-411575, we used mice carrying the above-mentioned Cre-inducible KrasG12V
oncogenic allele (KrasLSLG12Vgeo) together with a tamoxifen-inducible Cre systemically
expressed under the RNA polymerase II promoter (Guerra et al., 2003). These mice develop
a mixture of lung adenomas (grades 1 to 3) and adenocarcinomas (grade 4) after induction
with tamoxifen. After 6-8 months of tamoxifen induction, we analyzed changes in tumor
size and tumor metabolism by X-ray Computed Tomography (CT) and by Positron Emission
Tomography (PET), respectively. Tumors above 0.5 mm diameter were detectable by CT,
but only those of grade 4 (i.e. adenocarcinomas) were PET-positive (Figures S3A-S3C).
Again, this recapitulates the human pathology where only malignant tumors are PETpositive (Fischer et al., 2001; Gould et al., 2001). Mice carrying KrasG12V-driven tumors
were periodically PET/CT-scanned and those carrying at least one PET-positive tumor were
randomly allocated into two groups that were treated daily by gavage with vehicle during 15
days or with 3 mg/kg of LSN-411575 during 15 days or 22 days.
Previous investigators have reported deleterious side effects when using GSIs, especially in
the gut (van Es et al., 2005; Wong et al., 2004). In the case of LSN-411575, it has been
reported that 10 mg/kg during 15 days produces toxicity in the intestine and mice lose
weight, while 1 mg/kg has no detectable effects and animals do not lose weight (Wong et al.,
2004). In our case, using 3 mg/kg, mice retained their normal weight after 15 days of
treatment, suggesting the absence of deleterious side effects (Figure S3D).

We obtained PET/CT scans of the same mice before and after 15 or 22 days of treatment
(Figure 4A). Quantification of the size of the tumors by CT (regardless of whether they are
PET-positive or PET-negative) revealed that vehicle-treated tumors increased in size (3.7×fold) after 15 days, while LSN-411575-treated ones grew significantly less than vehicletreated controls (1.7×-fold after 15 days and 1.2×-fold after 22 days) (Figure 4B). It is
important to note, that some of the animals presented atelectasis, which prevents detection
by CT. Given the fact that CT cannot discriminate between non-malignant and malignant
tumors, we selectively focused on the response of PET-positive tumors (i.e.
adenocarcinomas) and quantified their total FDG (18F-fluor-deoxyglucose) uptake pre- and
post-treatment. In the case of vehicle-treated mice, PET-positive tumors increased their total
FDG uptake an average of 2.2×-fold during the 15 days of treatment (Figure 4C).
Importantly, in the case of LSN-411575-treated mice, the average change was 0.7×-fold
after 15 days and 1.0×-fold after 22 days (Figure 4C). These results indicate that
LSN-411575 has a significant inhibitory effect on the growth of autochthonous murine
KrasG12V-driven NSCLCs.
Pharmacological inhibition of γ-secretase interferes with ERK phosphorylation in
KrasG12V-driven NSCLCs

Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts

Treated KrasG12V-driven NSCLCs (see Figure 4C) were analyzed by immunohistochemistry
(samples were obtained 4-8 h after the last treatment). Our first goal was to evaluate whether
the GSI treatment had reached its target and, for this, we used the levels of HES1 as a
surrogate marker of -secretase activity. In accordance with our previous observations (see
above Figure 1), vehicle-treated NSCLCs were strongly positive for HES1 (Figure 5A). In
contrast to this, LSN-411575-treated (15 days) NSCLCs showed a clear reduction in HES1
levels, confirming that the drug is actually reaching its target within the tumors and at their
natural localization (Figure 5A). Also, in agreement with the robust increase in FDG uptake
observed during the 15-day interval (Figure 4C), these tumors were highly proliferative
(Ki67 staining) and had a low level of apoptosis (activated caspase-3 staining) (Figure 5A).
Interestingly, LSN-411575-treated (15 days) NSCLCs presented decreased levels of Ki67positive cells and a higher frequency of apoptotic cells compared to vehicle-treated tumors
(Figure 5A). Of note, these tumors, except for their loss of mitotic cells, retain all their other
histological features of grade 4 tumors (characteristically defined by the presence of
enlarged pleomorphic nuclei exhibiting a high degree of nuclear atypia and multinucleated
giant cells) (Jackson et al., 2005). These observations, strongly suggest that LSN-411575 is
arresting cancer growth by inhibiting proliferation and increasing apoptosis.
In an effort to understand the anti-tumoral effect of LSN-411575, we explored a number of
key players in lung cancer, such as ERK (Engelman et al., 2008), AKT (Yang et al., 2008),
S6K (Liang et al.) and NF B (Meylan et al., 2009). In the case of AKT (phospho-Ser473AKT1), S6K (phospho-Thr389-S6K1) and NF B (nuclear p65), we could not find
differences between the staining of NSCLCs treated for 15 days with vehicle or with
LSN-411575 (Figure S4A). In contrast to the above, we found a remarkable effect on the
activity of ERK. In particular, vehicle-treated NSCLCs were strongly positive for pERK1/
pERK2 (phospho-Thr202/Tyr204-ERK1 and phospho-Thr185/Tyr187-ERK2), while
LSN-411575-treated NSCLCs were significantly weaker for pERK (Figure 5A). The results
obtained by immunohistochemistry were confirmed by immunoblotting of tumor extracts.
Specifically, we observed lower levels of HES1 and pERK1/pERK2 in LSN-411575-treated
(15 days) NSCLCs compared to the corresponding vehicle-treated tumors (Figure 5B). We
wondered whether the lower levels of pERK1/pERK2 were associated to lower levels of its
activating kinase MEK, however, the levels of pMEK1/2 (phospho-Ser217/Ser221MEK1/2) remained similar in vehicle- and LSN-411575-treated NSCLCs (Figure 5B), thus
suggesting that the inhibition of pERK exerted by LSN-411575 is independent of MEK

activity. Finally, we wanted to test whether the key observed changes in HES1 and pERK
were early events upon LSN-411575 treatment initiation. For this, we treated mice for 4
days with LSN-411575 and, interestingly, the levels of HES1 and pERK in NSCLCs were
already lower than in vehicle-treated tumors and similar to tumors treated with the drug for
15 days (Figure 5C). Collectively, these observations indicate that treatment with
LSN-411575 arrests KrasG12V-driven NSCLCs in association with inhibition of HES1 and
ERK phosphorylation.
Inhibition of γ-secretase increases DUSP1 in human and murine oncogenic-Kras NSCLCs
Previous investigators have reported that the Notch pathway upregulates pERK levels in in
vitro cultured cells (Kim et al., 2005; Konishi et al., 2007; Michie et al., 2007). However,
the mechanisms involved have remained unexplored. In an effort to understand the link
between the Notch pathway and pERK in the context of lung cancer cells, we focused on the
human NSCLC cell line H358 which carries an oncogenic KRAS allele (KRASG12C) and
requires the activity of the oncogene for its viability (Singh et al., 2009). Recapitulating the
results obtained in our lung mouse model, H358 cells treated with the -secretase inhibitor
DAPT (5 M) also showed lower levels of pERK (Figure 6A). We also explored two other
human KRAS-mutated NSCLC cell lines, namely, A549 and H23, which carry KRASG12S
and KRASG12C alleles, respectively (Blanco et al., 2009), but whose growth is independent
of KRAS activity (Singh et al., 2009). Interestingly, these cell lines also showed decreased
levels of pERK upon DAPT treatment (Figure S5A), but the magnitude of the effect was not
as pronounced as in KRAS-dependent H358 cells.

Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts

To get an insight onto the mechanism by which inhibition of the Notch pathway interferes
with ERK phosphorylation, we performed RNA microarray analyses to compare GSI-treated
and non-treated H358 cells (Table S1). For these assays, we used DAPT, which is a widely
used GSI for in vitro cultured cells (Wolfe, 2009). As expected, among the genes
significantly downregulated by DAPT (FDR p<0.05; magnitude log2 fold change ≤0.5xfold) we identified HES1. Among the genes that showed significant upregulation by DAPT
(FDR p<0.05; magnitude log2 fold change ≥0.5x-fold), we noticed the dual specificity
phosphatases DUSP1 and DUSP6, which are well-known negative regulators of MAP
kinases including ERK (Patterson et al., 2009). Interestingly, DUSP1 is repressed by the
Notch pathway in a NSCLC cell line (Haruki et al., 2005), while we are not aware of a
similar link for DUSP6. Validation by qRT-PCR confirmed the upregulation of both DUSP1
and DUSP6 mRNAs after treatment of H358 cells with DAPT, while HES1 mRNA levels
were downregulated (Figure 6B; Figure S5B). We confirmed that these changes in HES1
and DUSP1 mRNA levels correlated with similar changes in the corresponding proteins
(Figure 6C). In the case of A549 and H23 cells, both showed a decrease in HES1 and an
upregulation of DUSP1 upon DAPT treatment, however, only A549 cells presented an
upregulation of DUSP6 (Figure S5B and S5C). In an effort to extrapolate these findings to a
different type of Notch-dependent cancer, we performed -secretase inhibition of a panel of
human T-ALL cell lines and we observed DUSP1 mRNA upregulation in all of them, albeit
with variable magnitude (Figure S5D), while DUSP6 had an erratic behavior (Figure S5D).
These results suggest that the upregulation of DUSP1 is a general feature of -secretase
inhibition in cancer.
DUSP1 has been implicated in the dephosphorylation of ERK, JNK and p38 (Patterson et
al., 2009). However, treatment with DAPT resulted in reduced levels of pERK (see above
Figure 6A) but did not affect the levels of phospho-JNK or phospho-p38 (Figure S5E). We
wanted to confirm that DUSP1 is dephosphorylating pERK in our experimental system and
for this we ectopically overexpressed a GFP-DUSP1 fusion (Wu et al., 2005) and we
measured the levels of pERK by immunofluorescence in the GFP-positive cells.
Interestingly, we observed that H358 cells expressing GFP-DUSP1 had very low levels of

pERK upon serum stimulation (10 min), while GFP control cells had high levels of pERK
under the same conditions (Figure 6D and 6E). Again, we obtained similar results in A549
and H23 cells (Figure S5F). Conversely, we performed loss of function studies. After testing
a total of 12 different RNAi against DUSP1 (4 siRNAs and 8 shRNAs), we only got a rather
modest effect when combining two shRNAs (namely, sh2+sh3) (Figure S5G). Despite the
partial decrease in DUSP1 levels, expression of the two shRNAs (sh2+sh3) increased the
levels of pERK in transfected H358, compared to a scrambled shRNA (shSC) (Figure 6F).
Moreover, expression of sh2+sh3 abolished the inhibitory effect of DAPT on pERK (Figure
6G), suggesting that the effects of DAPT on pERK are mediated by DUSP1. We also
wondered whether DAPT treatment affected or not the levels of pMEK in H358 cells. We
could not observe changes in pMEK induced by DAPT (Figure S5H), which is in agreement
with our previous observations in GSI-treated tumors (Figure 5B). These results support the
concept that GSI treatment inhibits KRAS signaling through DUSP1, by decreasing the
levels of pERK and without affecting the activity of MEK.
To validate in vivo the above data, we compared the levels of Dusp1 and Dusp6 mRNAs in
primary murine KrasG12V-driven NSCLCs treated or not for 15 days with LSN-411575.
Importantly, adenocarcinomas from mice treated with LSN-411575, presented increased
levels of Dusp1/DUSP1 (Figure 6H and 6I) and decreased levels of Hes1/HES1 (Figure 5B
and 6H) mRNA and protein, compared with vehicle treated adenocarcinomas. In contrast,
we could not observe changes in Dusp6 (Figure S5I). Together, these data establish a tight
association between HES1 downregulation and DUSP1 induction upon GSI treatment in
cancer.
HES1 directly binds and represses the DUSP1 promoter

Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts

The transcriptional repressor HES1 is a critical mediator of NOTCH1-driven cancer
(Wendorff et al., 2010). Based on this and our above data, we hypothesized that HES1 could
repress DUSP1. To explore this, we began by performing DUSP1 promoter assays using a
luciferase reporter. Interestingly, treatment of H358 cells with DAPT induced the DUSP1
promoter and this was cancelled when HES1 was co-transfected (Figure 7A). These results
further reinforce our previous observations that -secretase inhibition upregulates the
expression of DUSP1 and suggest that this could be mediated by the downregulation of
HES1. Additionally, the basal activity of the DUSP1 promoter was decreased by HES1
expression (Figures 7A and 7B). Also, as a marginal note, treatment of cells with a
pharmacological MEK inhibitor (PD0325901) decreased the activity of the DUSP1
promoter (Figure 7B), according to the known role of MEK as a positive regulator of
DUSP1 expression (Brondello et al., 1997), again suggesting that -secretase inhibition
exerts its actions in a MEK independent manner.
Having observed that HES1 has the ability to repress the DUSP1 promoter, we asked
whether HES1 directly binds to the DUSP1 promoter. HES1 binds two similar sequence
motifs known as class C sites and N-boxes (Iso et al., 2003) and examination of the human
and murine DUSP1/Dusp1 promoters revealed the presence of several putative HES1
binding sites (Figure S6). We tested whether HES1 directly binds to the human DUSP1
promoter by chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) using two different antibodies against
HES1 in H358 cells. Interestingly, HES1 immunoprecipitation with two different antibodies
resulted in significant enrichment of two regions of the DUSP1 promoter compared to a
control IgG immunoprecipitation (Figure 7C). In contrast, no enrichment was observed
when a DUSP1 intronic region was amplified or when cells were treated with DAPT (Figure
7C). As a positive control, we used the DELTEX1 promoter, which is directly repressed by
HES1 (Zhang et al., 2010). As expected, binding of HES1 to the DELTEX1 promoter was
observed in the absence of DAPT, but not in its presence (Figure 7C).

We wanted to test the effect of HES1 inhibition on DUSP1 levels and ERK phosphorylation.
Treatment of H358 cells with a pool of siRNAs targeting HES1 mRNA (siHES1) effectively
reduced HES1 mRNA and protein levels (Figures 7D and 7E) and, importantly, this resulted
in significant upregulation of DUSP1 mRNA and protein levels (Figures 7D and 7E). We
have previously demonstrated that DUSP1 dephosphorylates pERK (Figures 6C and 6D)
and, in agreement with this, siHES1 reduced the levels of phosphorylated ERK (Figures 7E
and 7F). Finally, previous reports have shown that GSIs can prevent the growth of human
cancer cell lines (Chen et al., 2007; Eliasz et al., 2010; Westhoff et al., 2009) and we
wondered whether this could also be the case of siHES1. Indeed, cells treated with siHES1
did have an impaired proliferative capacity (Figure 7G). All together, inhibition of HES1 in
NSCLCs cells recapitulates the effect of DAPT treatment on DUSP1 expression, ERK
phosphorylation and cell proliferation.
High HES1 and low DUSP1 levels are associated with poor clinical outcome in human
NSCLCs patients

Previous investigators have reported that subsets of human NSCLCs have hyperactivated the
Notch pathway (Haruki et al., 2005; Westhoff et al., 2009) and this correlates with a poor
clinical outcome (Westhoff et al., 2009). In the light of our above results, we wanted to
extend this to HES1 and to examine its relation with DUSP1. We examined the levels of
HES1 in a series of NSCLCs (n=82) observing that tumors with high levels of nuclear HES1
are associated with a shorter overall survival (logrank, p=0.045) (Figure 8A; Figure S7A).
Previous investigators have found a positive correlation between DUSP1 levels and survival
in human NSCLCs (Vicent et al., 2004). We repeated and confirmed this result in our
NSCLCs series where we obtained a positive correlation between DUSP1 cytoplasmic
expression and better overall survival (logrank, p=0.048) (Figure 8B; Figure S7A).
Moreover, when patients were stratified according to HES1 and DUSP1, those combining
high HES1 intensity and low DUSP1 expression had the poorest outcome compared to the
other three possible combinations (logrank test, p=0.09) (Figure S7B). Finally, there was a
negative correlation between HES1 intensity and DUSP1 expression (correlation coefficient
−0.219; Kendall Tau-b test, p=0.07). Collectively, these observations support the relevance
of HES1 in human NSCLCs and reinforce the concept that HES1 represses DUSP1.

DISCUSSION
In the present work we have investigated the role of the Notch pathway in the generation
and maintenance of primary KrasG12V-driven NSCLCs.
It had been previously described that a significant fraction of human NSCLCs present a
hyperactive Notch pathway (Haruki et al., 2005; Westhoff et al., 2009), but there was no
information about the role of the Notch pathway in the development of NSCLCs. To address
this question, we have used a mouse model with a latent Kras oncogene that faithfully
recapitulates the development of human NSCLCs (Guerra et al., 2003; Jackson et al., 2001;
Sweet-Cordero et al., 2005). First, we validated our mouse model by observing that, as in
humans, the Notch pathway is hyperactive in murine KrasG12V-driven NSCLCs compared to
normal lung. This is documented by higher levels of active -secretase complex, increased
NICD levels (the activated form of NOTCH1), decreased Numb mRNA (a negative
regulator of the Notch pathway) and increased HES1 protein (a downstream target of
Notch). Interestingly, Hes1 protein levels increased in parallel to the degree of
malignization, suggesting a requirement of Notch pathway activity during this process.
Importantly, genetic elimination of either the -secretase complex (upstream of the Notch
pathway) or Rbpj (encoding the canonical DNA-binding partner of NOTCH receptors)
abolished the formation of KrasG12V-driven NSCLCs. These results indicate that the
generation of NSCLCs by oncogenic Kras requires the activation of the Notch pathway.

Based on the above, we hypothesized that Notch activity may be also required for the
maintenance of primary KrasG12V-driven NSCLCs. Previous reports in this direction have
shown that -secretase inhibition slows the growth of subcutaneous xenografts formed by
lung cancer cells (Konishi et al., 2007; Luistro et al., 2009; Paris et al., 2005). Xenografts,
despite their utility, do not recapitulate the microenvironment of the natural primary tumors
and this may have a critical impact on therapeutic activity, as it has been elegantly illustrated
in the case of pancreatic cancer (Olive et al., 2009). Only a handful of studies have evaluated
the efficacy of chemotherapy on primary murine lung tumors (Engelman et al., 2008; Ji et
al., 2007; Yang et al., 2008). These studies are largely based on Magnetic Resonance
Imaging (MRI) or Computed Tomography (CT), which cannot discriminate non-malignant
tumors from malignant ones. Here, in an effort to recapitulate a human clinical setting, we
have also evaluated therapeutic responses by Positron Emission Tomography (PET), thus
focusing exclusively on malignant tumors. Importantly, mice treated with the
pharmacologically active -secretase inhibitor LSN-411575 showed a complete blockade of
cancer growth. These results demonstrate that GSIs are therapeutically effective in mice for
primary autochthonous KrasG12V-driven NSCLCs.

Analyses of LSN-411575-treated KrasG12V-driven NSCLCs indicated a significant
reduction in the levels of HES1 as soon as 4 days after treatment, thus confirming that the
GSI reaches its target. In addition, treated NSCLCs presented decreased proliferation and
increased apoptosis. Among a number of key candidate proteins that could be affected by
GSI treatment, we selectively detected an effect on the phosphorylation of ERK, which was
dramatically reduced after treatment. This observation is in accordance with previous data in
in vitro cultured cells reporting that the Notch pathway upregulates the levels of ERK
phosphorylation (Kim et al., 2005; Konishi et al., 2007; Michie et al., 2007). Importantly,
the role of ERK phosphorylation in Kras-driven NSCLCs has been recently highlighted by
the demonstration that ERK activity is essential for Kras-driven lung tumorigenesis (Blasco
et al., 2011; Feldser et al., 2010; Junttila et al., 2010). Since MEK is the critical kinase
responsible for ERK phosphorylation, we also examined the levels of phosphorylated MEK
in GSI-treated NSCLCs but, in contrast to phospho-ERK, the levels of phospho-MEK were
not affected by the GSI. In summary, we have found that GSI treatment of primary
autochthonous KrasG12V-driven NSCLCs impinges on the phosphorylation of ERK without
affecting MEK activity.
To dissect the mechanism linking -secretase inhibition with dephosphorylation of ERK, we
analyzed the transcriptional changes induced by GSI. In particular, we used a human
NSCLC cell line, H358, which is addicted to oncogenic KRAS (Singh et al., 2009). These
cells, as we show here, dephosphorylate ERK in response to GSI treatment, without
affecting phospho-MEK, thus recapitulating the behavior of primary KrasG12V-driven
NSCLCs. Among the set of genes whose expression was induced by GSI treatment, we
focused our attention on the dual specificity phosphatase DUSP1 because previous data in
human NSCLCs cells indicate that this phosphatase is regulated by the Notch pathway
(Haruki et al., 2005) and it dephosphorylates ERK (Lin et al., 2003; Patterson et al., 2009).
Indeed, we have confirmed with both gain and loss of function experiments the concept that
DUSP1 affects ERK phosphorylation in human H358 cells. Moreover, the induction of
DUSP1 after GSI treatment was confirmed in another two human NSCLC cell lines and in
six human T-ALL cell lines, thus giving more general validity to our findings. Finally, we
observed Dusp1 upregulation in GSI-treated murine primary KrasG12V-driven NSCLCs.
Therefore, the observed association between GSI treatment and DUSP1 upregulation occurs
in the context of primary NSCLCs and could explain the reduction in ERK phosphorylation
upon GSI treatment.

HES1 is a well-known transcriptional repressor of multiples genes (Iso et al., 2003; Sang et
al., 2010), including genes relevant for T-ALL such as PTEN (Palomero et al., 2007) and
CYLD (Espinosa et al., 2010), thus activating AKT and NF B, respectively. Even more, it
has been recently demonstrated that HES1 plays a critical role in the maintenance of
NOTCH1-driven murine T-ALL (Wendorff et al., 2010). Based on our observation that
HES1 levels increase in association with malignization and decrease upon GSI treatment of
KrasG12V-driven NSCLCs, we hypothesized that GSI-induced dephosphorylation of ERK
could be mediated by HES1-mediated repression of DUSP1. Indeed, luciferase reporter
assays supported the concept that HES1 is a negative regulator of DUSP1. Furthermore,
chromatin immunoprecipitation showed that HES1 directly binds and represses DUSP1, and
importantly, this can be reverted by GSI treatment. Finally, treatment of H358 cells with
siHES1 promoted a phenotype very similar to GSI treatment in terms of ERK
phosphorylation, DUSP1 upregulation and cell growth arrest.
We finally checked the status of HES1 and DUSP1 in primary human NSCLCs. We found
that low DUSP1 is associated with poor survival, which is in agreement with previous data
(Vicent et al., 2004). In support of our proposed mechanism, we found that high HES1
levels are also associated with poor survival. Moreover, we also observed a suggestive
negative correlation between HES1 intensity and DUSP1 expression. These observations
support the relevance of HES1 in human NSCLCs and reinforce the concept that HES1
represses DUSP1.

Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts

Collectively, our observations establish a direct causal link between -secretase inhibition,
HES1 downregulation, DUSP1 derepression and ERK dephosphorylation (Figure 8C). As
mentioned above, high ERK activity is crucial for the development of Kras-driven NSCLCs
(Blasco et al., 2011; Feldser et al., 2010; Junttila et al., 2010) and, in this regard, we propose
that our observed requirement of the Notch pathway for NSCLCs formation is related to the
capacity of HES1 to increase ERK activity through repression of Dusp1. Despite our current
data pointing to HES1 and DUSP1 as relevant mediators of the effects of GSI treatment on
the KRAS signaling pathway, we cannot exclude the possibility that other members of the
HES1 family or DUSP1 family, or other unrelated mechanisms, could also participate in
mediating the effects of GSI treatment.
The results presented in this work strengthen the potential therapeutic benefits of targeting secretase in NSCLC. We show that GSI treatment inhibits ERK without affecting MEK and,
hence, we envision a synergistic effect of MEK inhibitors and GSIs on KRAS-driven
NSCLCs. Importantly, GSIs have been shown to be pharmacologically active in humans
(Bateman et al., 2009) and have been tested in clinical trials for Alzheimer’s disease
(Fleisher et al., 2008; Panza et al., 2009; Wolfe, 2009), which could facilitate the evaluation
of these compounds for the treatment of human lung cancer, the leading cause of cancerrelated deaths in the world.

Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts

The compound was kindly provided by Eli Lilly & Co (Indianapolis, IN) formulated in 1%
carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC), 0.25% Tween 80. The compound was given orally by
gavage, early in the morning, at a dose of 3 mg/kg/day during the indicated number of days.
Control mice were treated with the vehicle following identical procedure. On the last day of
treatment, PET was performed within 2-6 hrs after gavage (vehicle- and compound-treated
mice were in alternate order for the analysis). Mice were sacrificed (within 4-8 hrs after
gavage) and samples were obtained for pathological and immunohistochemical analyses.
Cellular treatments
H358 human NSCLCs cells were purchased from ATCC. Cells were treated with 5 M
DAPT (Calbiochem) for 36 h in the presence of serum. After this, cells were serum starved
for 12 h in the presence of DAPT or vehicle, as corresponding. When noted, cells were
serum stimulated for the indicated time. For additional details, see Supplemental
Experimental Procedures.
Human samples
Primary lung tumors were collected and handled anonymously at collaborating institutions
(Instituto Angel H. Roffo and Hospital Britanico) after approval by their Institutional
Review Boards (IRB) and following standard ethical and legal protection guidelines of
human subjects, including informed consent.

SIGNIFICANCE

Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts

NOTCH oncogenic mutations have been found in T-cell leukemias and lung cancer. In Tcell leukemias, oncogenic NOTCH activates AKT and NF B through HES1-mediated
transcriptional repression of PTEN and CYLD, respectively. Little is known, however,
about how the Notch pathway participates in lung cancer. Here, we show that Notch
pathway inhibition, either genetically or pharmacologically, hampers primary KrasG12Vdriven non-small cell lung carcinomas (NSCLCs). We demonstrate that HES1 directly
represses the promoter of DUSP1, which encodes a dual specificity phosphatase with
activity against phospho-ERK. Treatment with GSIs induces DUSP1 expression and this
is associated with loss of ERK phosphorylation, a critical player in NSCLCs. These
results validate the potential of GSIs in the treatment of primary NSCLCs.
