ABSTRACT
Treatment options for ovarian cancer patients remain limited and overall survival
is less than 50% despite recent clinical advances. The lipid phosphatase inositol
polyphosphate 4-phosphatase type II (INPP4B) has been described as a tumor
suppressor in the PI3K/Akt pathway with loss of expression found most pronounced
in breast, ovarian cancer and melanoma. Using microarray technology we identified a
DNA repair defect in INPP4B-deficient cells, which we further characterized by comet
assays and quantification of γH2AX, RAD51 and 53BP1 foci formation. INPP4B loss
resulted in significantly increased sensitivity towards PARP inhibition, comparable
to loss of BRCA1 in two- and three-dimensional in vitro models, as well as in in vivo
xenograft models. Mechanistically, we discovered that INPP4B forms a protein
complex with the key players of DNA repair, ATR and BRCA1, in GST pulldown and
293T overexpression assays, and INPP4B loss affects BRCA1, ATM and ATR protein
stability resulting in the observed DNA repair defect. Given that INPP4B loss has
been found in 40% of ovarian cancer patients, this study provides the rationale for
establishing INPP4B as a biomarker of PARP inhibitor response, and consequently
offers novel therapeutic options for a significant subset of patients. Loss of the
tumor suppressor inositol polyphosphate 4-phosphatase type II (INPP4B) results
in a DNA repair defect due to concomitant loss of BRCA1, ATR and ATM and can be
therapeutically targeted with PARP inhibitors.

studies [1]. Generally, genome maintenance systems
detect and resolve defects in DNA ensuring that rates of
spontaneous mutation are very low. In cancer, genomic
instability can arise through a diverse array of defects
affecting various components of the DNA-maintenance
machinery, which are selectively advantageous and
therefore instrumental for tumor formation and

progression [2, 3]. These defects can sensitize cells
towards the deleterious effects of DNA-damaging agents
such as cisplatin or inhibitors of poly-ADP-ribosylation.
Poly-ADP-ribose-polymerase (PARP) is a nuclear
enzyme that senses DNA single strand breaks (SSBs) and
is essential for base excision repair (BER). Once BER is
disabled, cells rely on alternative DNA damage response
(DDR) pathways, such as homologous recombination
(HR), for DNA repair. Dysfunction of HR, for instance
in BRCA1-deficient cells, presents a context in which
inhibition of BER (e.g. by treating with PARP-inhibitors)
is synthetically lethal [4], thus offering a therapeutic
strategy for tumors with defective BRCA1. However, it
is less clear how other signaling pathways such as the
phosphoinositide-3 kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathway interplay
with DDR and whether this can be therapeutically
exploited.
Extensive studies have revealed the impact of the
PI3K/Akt pathway activation on three cellular processes
crucial for tumor progression: cell proliferation, cell
survival and cell growth. Class IA PI3K activation gives
rise to phosphatidylinositol(3, 4, 5)trisphosphate (PIP3)
and phosphatidylinositol(3, 4)bisphosphate (PI(3, 4)P2)
[5]. PIP3 and PI(3, 4)P2 bind to the pleckstrin homology
domain of serine/threonine kinases Akt and PDK1,
which results in increased cell proliferation, survival
and cell growth [6]. Mechanisms to dephosphorylate
PIP3 include the activity of lipid phosphatases PTEN and
SHIP1/2, which hydrolyze PIP3 to PI(4, 5)P2 and PI(3, 4)
P2, respectively [7, 8]. PI(3, 4)P2 is the main phospholipid
substrate of the tumor suppressor inositol polyphosphate
4-phosphatase type II (INPP4B) which acts downstream
of SHIP1/2 and produces PI(3)P, thereby terminating
signaling through the PI3K/Akt pathway. Loss of INPP4B
expression has been found in various human cancers with
major loss in breast, ovarian and prostate cancers, as
well as in melanomas [9, 10] and results in increased cell
proliferation, migration and invasion. Furthermore, loss of
INPP4B was shown to lead to increased signaling through
the PI3K/Akt pathway [9, 11].
Recent literature suggests that Akt plays a role
in modulating checkpoint responses and DNA repair.
Overexpression of constitutively active Akt1, as well
as PTEN loss, was found to abrogate G2 cell cycle
checkpoint and Chk1 activation upon genotoxic stress
[12, 13]. Studies in breast cancer cell lines and patients
revealed that hyperactivated Akt promotes genome
instability by repressing HR [14]. Recently, INPP4B was
suggested to be a novel resistance biomarker in human
laryngeal cancer, through association of high INPP4B
expression levels with resistance to radiotherapy [15].
In basal-like breast cancer, DNA copy number loss
of INPP4B was found to be associated with genomic
instability and poor patient outcome [16]. However, a
link between INPP4B status and HR function in ovarian
and other human epithelial tumors has not been made but

may be therapeutically beneficial. Clinical examples that
take advantage of defective DNA repair in cancer therapy
include single and combination treatment of germline
BRCA1/2 ovarian, breast and prostate cancers with PARP
inhibitors [17]. Adopting a similar approach for INPP4Bdeficient tumors may broaden the window of therapeutic
applications for PARP inhibitors in a greater selection of
tumors and establish INPP4B as a tumor biomarker.

RESULTS
INPP4B is frequently lost in human tumors
and metastases
INPP4B is the target of frequent copy number
loss in a variety of solid tumors including the majority
of basal-like breast cancers, ovarian cancers and
melanomas [9]. We performed a comprehensive analysis of
INPP4B overall gene expression in metastatic melanomas
compared to primary melanomas using the Oncomine
database [18]. We found significantly lower INPP4B
expression in metastatic melanomas compared to primary
lesions (Figure 1A) corroborating earlier findings that
loss of INPP4B expression may modulate the metastatic
potential of tumors [9]. Additionally, we confirmed
earlier studies demonstrating strong association of loss of
INPP4B expression with poor overall survival in patients
bearing ductal breast carcinomas (Figure 1B, INPP4B
expression in invasive breast carcinoma; Figure 1C, overall
patient survival) [9]. Taken together, these findings point
to a critical role of INPP4B in overall patient survival and
metastatic disease.

Loss of INPP4B results in a ‘BRCA1-negative’
gene expression signature
In order to identify pathways in INPP4B-deficient
tumors that may be exploited for targeted treatments,
we performed a microarray gene expression analysis to
compare the human mammary epithelial cell line MCF10A stably expressing shRNA hairpins directed against
INPP4B versus Renilla luciferase (control) (Supplemental
Figure S1A) using the Affymetrix Human Genome U133
Plus array (~40, 000 genes, Supplemental Figure S2A
to  D). We identified significantly enriched gene sets in
MCF-10A shRNA-INPP4B expressing cell pools compared
to controls as illustrated in the heat-map (Figure 1D).
Subsequent analyses of differentially expressed genes
using the biological processes and Kyoto Encyclopedia
of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways revealed
altered components in metabolic and differentiation
pathways (Figure 1E and 1F). By Gene Set Enrichment
Analysis (GSEA) we found that INPP4B  knockdown
cells are significantly enriched with the ‘brca_brca1_
neg gene signature’ (p = 0.0001, Figures 1G and 1H)
10549

corresponding to differentially expressed genes in
BRCA1-negative tumors. The ‘BRCA1-negative’ gene
signature was validated by quantitative RT-PCR, using
primers for significantly changed genes within the gene
signature set (Supplemental Figure S3A). In addition,
we compared our gene expression gene set with the
recently established 60-gene signature for ‘BRCAness’
defined by Konstantinopoulos et al. [19], and positively
correlated 71% of differentially expressed genes in
MCF-10A shRNA-INPP4B with the 60-gene signature
(Supplemental Figure S3B and Supplemental Table 1).

no abberation in olive tail moment in Ovca429 shRNAPTEN expressing cell pools, contrary to the DNA repair
deficiency associated with PTEN loss reported elsewhere
(Supplemental Figure 4A) [20, 21].
Detection of Ser-139 phosphorylated histone variant
H2AX (γH2AX) has emerged as a highly specific and
sensitive marker for monitoring DNA damage initiation
and resolution [22]. We quantified γH2AX foci formation
in Ovca433 and Ovca429 cells expressing shRNA-Renilla
luciferase or shRNA-INPP4B and examined de novo
temporal and spatial distribution of DSB formation 0 min,
30 min, 60 min and 180 min after etoposide treatment
(Figure 2B). INPP4B knockdown resulted in increased
number and intensity of γH2AX foci compared to controls
Interestingly, increased γH2AX foci were readily observed
in untreated INPP4B knockdown pools pointing to an
intrinsic HR defect.
H2AX plays a facilitative role in HR and has been
shown to participate in RAD51-mediated suppression of
DSBs generated in absence of ATR [23]. Furthermore,
it was reported that retention of γH2AX foci 24 hours
post-treatment with DNA damaging drugs also involved
retention of RAD51 [24]. In order to assess whether
RAD51 protein recruitment to sites of DNA damage
is altered, Ovca429 INPP4B and Renilla luciferase
knockdown cell pools were treated with etoposide and
cells stained for RAD51 6 h, 12 h, and 24 h thereafter.
RAD51 foci were found quantitatively and qualitatively
increased in INPP4B knockdown cells (42% cells
> 15 foci/nucleus) compared to controls (18% cells
> 15 foci/nucleus) most prominent at 24 h (Figure 2C).
53BP1 (p53 binding protein 1) is required for
p53 accumulation and G2-M checkpoint arrest in
response to ionizing radiation, and 53BP1 accumulation
at DSBs  was reported to be dependent upon γH2AX
formation [25]. Supportive of this, 53BP1 foci were
found increased 6 h and 12 h after etoposide treatment

INPP4B loss results in a DNA repair defect
Based on our findings that loss of INPP4B resembles
features of BRCA1-negative tumors, we hypothesized that
INPP4B deficiency may lead to defects in DNA repair.
Stable knockdown cell pools of the human ovarian cancer
cell lines Ovca429 and Ovca433 expressing shRNA
hairpins directed against Renilla luciferase, INPP4B,
PTEN and BRCA1 were generated. Cell pools over clones
were chosen to best reflect heterogeneity of protein loss in
the tumor environment. On average, a 50% knockdown
efficiency for INPP4B was achieved (Supplemental
Figure 1B). To investigate DNA repair efficiency single
cell gel electrophoresis assays (Comet assays) under
alkaline conditions were conducted (Figure 2A). Ovca429
knockdown cell pools were lysed 0, 15, 30, 45, 60 and
90 min after x-ray irradiation and the intensity and length
of comet tails relative to head (tail moment) were analyzed
after cell electrophoresis. Ovca429 shRNA-INPP4B cell
pools revealed significantly increased tail moment at early
time points of DNA repair compared to Renilla luciferase
knockdown controls pointing to decreased DNA repair.
At later time points (t = 45 min and t = 60 min) INPP4B
knockdown cell pools continued to display a higher
level of residual strand breaks. In contrast, we observed

Loss of INPP4B is associated with sensitivity
towards PARP inhibition

in Ovca429 shRNA-INPP4B cells compared to control
cells, as well as in untreated conditions (Supplemental
Figure 4B).
Plo et al. demonstrated that activated Akt1 repressed
HR through cytoplasmic retention of BRCA1 and RAD51
resulting in a BRCA1-deficient phenotype in breast cancer
[14]. Thus, Ovca433 knockdown cell pools were fixed 0 h,
7 h and 24 h after irradiation and investigated for BRCA1
foci formation (Supplemental Figure 4C). Knocking down
INPP4B in Ovca433 cells did not result in cytoplasmic
retention of BRCA1 and is suggestive of a different
mechanism of defective DNA repair.

As mutations in checkpoint and DNA repair
pathways are associated with cancer, tumor cells defective
in HR repair with diminished or ablated BRCA1/2 gene
function, show extensive DNA repair lesions and are
more sensitive to PARP inhibitors [26, 27]. We next
determined whether lack of competent HR due to INPP4B
loss might sensitize INPP4B-deficient human ovarian
cancer cells to PARP inhibition. In clonogenic assays,
upon continuous treatment with PARP inhibitor olaparib,

Ovca429 and Ovca433 shRNA-INPP4B cell pools
displayed significantly increased sensitivity similar to
BRCA1 or PTEN knockdown (Ovca429, Figure 3A;
Ovca433, Supplemental Figure 5A). In proliferation assays
Ovca429 shRNA-INPP4B cell pools displayed a dosedependent and significantly increased sensitivity upon
olaparib treatment compared to controls (Supplemental
Figure 5B).
Next, we determined whether the observed olaparib
sensitivity in Ovca429 and Ovca433 INPP4B knockdown
cell pools translated into corresponding sensitivity in
cell lines with varying endogenous expression levels of
INPP4B or PTEN. Therefore, we characterized INPP4B
and PTEN expression levels, as well as PI3K/Akt
(phosphoS473 Akt) and MAPK pathway (phospho-p42/44)
activation in ten different human ovarian cancer cell lines
(Supplemental Figure 5C). In dose-response proliferation
assays we found that A2780 (INPP4B− / −, PTEN− / −)
cells demonstrated highest olaparib sensitivity followed
by the INPP4B-negative Ovcar3 (INPP4B− / −, PTEN+/+).
Ovca433 cells (INPP4B+/+, PTEN+/+) displayed greatest
olaparib resistance. Additional PTEN loss in INPP4Bdeficient Ovcar3 cells resulted in additive olaparib
sensitivity similar to the A2780 cell line (INPP4B− / −,
PTEN− / −) (Figure 3B; protein expression, Supplemental
Figure 5D). PTEN knockdown in Ovcar3 cells resulted in
additive olaparib sensitivity similar to the A2780 cell line
(INPP4B− / −, PTEN− / −) (Figure 3B).
In clonogenic assays we examined growth
inhibition of Ovca429 knockdown cell pools treated
with cisplatin and olaparib. Cells were continuously
treated with 1 μM olaparib for 6 days preceded with a
single dose of 10 μM cisplatin on day 1 (Figure 3C).
Ovca429 INPP4B knockdown cells showed significantly

A

** p= 0.000865

increased sensitivity to single agent cisplatin or olaparib
compared to controls consistent with a DNA repair
deficiency [28–31]. Combination treatment resulted in
an additive effect, with significantly greater inhibition of
clonogenic outgrowth in Ovca429 INPP4B knockdown
pools compared to controls. Combination treatment of
Ovca433 shRNA-PTEN cell pools gave similar results.
In rescue experiments re-expression of Flag-tagged
INPP4B in the INPP4B-deficient Igrov-1 cell line
(Supplemental Figure 5E) resulted in a 2-fold increase
in olaparib resistance in cell proliferation assays
(Figure 3D).
In three-dimensional growth assays we
investigated the effect of olaparib treatment on
established spheroids from Ovca429 shRNA-Renilla
luciferase, shRNA-PTEN and shRNA- INPP4B
cell pools. Cells were grown on collagen layer and
established spheroids were continuously treated with
olaparib for three days (Figure 3E). As expected,
spheroid size of mock treated INPP4B and PTEN
knockdown cell pools were considerably larger than
that of control cells. Upon olaparib treatment INPP4B
knockdown cell pools showed significantly reduced
spheroid size compared to knockdown controls (Box
plot, Figure 3F; quantitation, Figure 3G); knocking down
PTEN did not result in similar size reduction.

post-treatment, mice were sacrificed and tumor volume

with Ovca429 shRNA-INPP4B cells presented larger

volumes of shRNA-INPP4B expressing tumors showed
significant  reduction compared to control treatment

(Figure 4A). Waterfall plot analysis comparing tumor
volumes at start and treatment end point revealed great
reduction of tumor volumes in the olaparib-treated

We continued to examine PARP inhibitor
sensitivity by ablating INPP4B expression in floxed
INPP4B (INPP4Bfl/fl) mouse embryonic fibroblasts
(MEFs). INPP4Bfl/fl MEFs were immortalized with

with increasing concentrations of olaparib. INPP4B loss
in INPP4Bfl/fl MEFs upon Ad5Cre treatment resulted in
significantly increased olaparib sensitivity compared to
control MEFs (Supplemental Figure 5F). Western blot
analysis of dose-dependent Ad5Cre infection efficiency
in INPP4Bfl/fl shRNA-p53 MEFs demonstrated 72 h postinfection loss of INPP4B greater than 50%. Examination
of BRCA1, ATR and ATM protein levels in the same
lysates revealed concomitant loss of BRCA1, ATR
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

and ATM proteins suggestive of a role for INPP4B in
BRCA1, ATM and ATR stability (western blot, Figure 5A;
quantitation Figure 5B).
Supporting this finding we noted a reduction of
INPP4B protein in MCF-10A shRNA-BRCA1 cells
(Supplemental Figure 1A and 5G). To control for a
potential Ad5Cre off-target effect INPP4B, BRCA1,
ATR and ATM protein levels of infected wildtype MEFs
were compared to INPP4Bfl/fl MEFs, however no changes

with the C-terminal fragment in immunoblots (overview
Figure 5C, western blot Figure 5E).

INPP4B affects protein stability of ATR
and BRCA1
The ubiquitin-proteasome pathway mediates
specific degradation of regulatory proteins and plays
an important role in controlling a variety of cellular
functions such as DNA repair and cell cycle control [32].
To examine the role of INPP4B loss on ATR, ATM and
BRCA1 protein stability we treated Ovca433 shRNAINPP4B and control cell pools with the proteasome
inhibitor MG132, and protein expression levels were
investigated (Figure 5C). Ovca433 shRNA-INPP4B cells
revealed reduced ATR, ATM and BRCA1 protein levels
compared to knockdown controls. While INPP4B protein
expression levels remained unchanged upon treatment
with MG132, expression of ATR and BRCA1 protein
levels increased compared to control pools, suggestive
of a role of INPP4B in ATR and BRCA1 protein stability.
No change in protein expression was observed for ATM
protein levels.

DISCUSSION
Up to 50% of epithelial ovarian cancers display
defects in the DNA damage response (DDR) pathway.
Recent studies have implicated Akt in modulating DDR
and genomic stability [33]. Similar defects in homologous
recombination (HR) have been described for loss of
PTEN, although its mechanism remains controversial [12,
21]. In this study we identified a DNA repair defect using
microarray analysis in INPP4B-deficient human mammary
epithelial cells. Additionally, we revealed that tumors
deficient in INPP4B display significant sensitization
towards PARP inhibition due to concomitant loss of
BRCA1, ATM and ATR. Tumors impaired in HR exhibit
increased sensitivity towards platinum-based agents, the
current first line treatment for ovarian cancer patients.
Accordingly, INPP4B knockdown cells demonstrated
increased sensitivity upon cisplatin treatment and in
combination treatment with PARP inhibitor olaparib
we found additive growth suppression. Olaparib has
demonstrated single agent activity in breast and ovarian
cancer patients with BRCA1/2 germline mutations [34,
35], with over 40% response rate reported in patients with
BRCA1-mutant ovarian cancer [34]. Additional fractions
of patients who may benefit from PARP inhibitors have
been recently identified by the Cancer Genome Atlas
Research Project, which reported that 50% of the analyzed
489 serous ovarian adenocarcinomas harbor a defect in

INPP4B forms a protein complex with ATR
and BRCA1
We further examined whether INPP4B interacts
in a protein complex with the DNA repair proteins
ATR, ATM and BRCA1. 293T cells expressing Flagtagged INPP4B (Flag-INPP4B) or empty Flag vector
(control) were lysed and Flag-INPP4B protein complexes
immunoprecipitated. Western blot analysis demonstrated
specific interaction of INPP4B with ATR and BRCA1,
but not with ATM or PTEN (Figure 5D). Interestingly, we
observed increased protein levels of BRCA1 in cell lysates
overexpressing Flag-INPP4B compared to control lysates.

the HR pathway [24]. These results suggest that ovarian
cancer patients with sporadic abnormalities in the HR
pathway may benefit from treatment with PARP inhibitors.
Currently, patients are being stratified for PARP inhibitor
treatment by germline BRCA1/2 mutation status, which
comprise 10–15% of ovarian cancer patients. However,
INPP4B loss has been found in 40% of ovarian tumors
revealing the clinical significance of INPP4B and its
potential use as a biomarker of PARP inhibitor response
for a broadened patient subset.
At present, it is being discussed whether PARP
inhibitors should be used alone or in combination with
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

chemotherapy in clinic; however, substantial bone marrow
toxicity has been reported for combination of PARP
inhibitors and chemotherapy. Given different underlying
defects of DNA repair may cause varying sensitivities
to PARP inhibitors in sporadic cancers, in the context
of tumor heterogeneity, combination treatments using
PARP inhibitors together with other targeted therapies
may be more effective. Juvekar et al. recently reported
efficacious combination of PARP inhibitors with the dual
PI3K/mTOR inhibitor NVP-BKM120 in BRCA1-related
breast tumors [36]. Ibrahim et al. showed that PI3K
blockade using PI3K inhibitors resulted in HR impairment
10557

and sensitization towards PARP inhibition in triple
negative breast carcinomas without BRCA1/2 mutations
[37]. However, we demonstrate that INPP4B loss and
subsequent activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway resulted
in significant sensitization towards PARP inhibition
suggesting an independent role for INPP4B in HR in
ovarian cancer.
In agreement with an underlying defect in DDR
we found increased accumulation of γH2AX foci in
unchallenged INPP4B knockdown cell pools compared
to controls. Upon genotoxic stress, induced etoposide
treatment, INPP4B-deficient cells revealed an increase
and retention of γH2AX, RAD51 and 53BP1 foci
relative to controls indicating abnormal DNA repair and
dysfunctional HR. While loss of BRCA1 function was
shown to result in suppressed RAD51 foci formation,
loss of ATR was linked to increased RAD51 foci
formation in conjunction with increased γH2AX foci
[23, 24]. Intriguingly, INPP4B loss led to concomitant
loss of BRCA1, ATM and ATR total protein levels in
MEFs. We also observed reduced ATR protein levels
in Ovca429 INPP4B knockdown cell pools compared
to controls (Supplemental Figure 5G). Additionally we
noted in MCF-10A shRNA-BRCA1 cell pools decreased
levels of INPP4B. Although the degree of INPP4B loss
that is needed for cancer cells to down-modulate ATR
and BRCA1 levels and to acquire sensitivity towards
PARP inhibitors still needs to be determined, we found
that INPP4B loss greater than 50% in MEFs resulted

in reduced levels of BRCA1, ATM and ATR proteins.
Mechanistically, INPP4B loss may potentially affect ATR
and BRCA1 protein stability due to disrupted proteinprotein interaction in INPP4B-deficient cells (summarized
in Figure 6). In GST pull down assays we identified the
N-terminal region of INPP4B (aa1–460) necessary for
interaction with ATR or BRCA1. Whether this effect
is a result of direct or indirect interaction of INPP4B
with ATR and BRCA1, and whether catalytic activity
is required for this association will need to be further
elucidated. However, our studies reveal that INPP4B
plays a crucial role in modulating the stability of key
players of the DDR pathway and can be therapeutically
exploited for cancer patients, thus providing the rationale
to investigate INPP4B as a biomarker of clinical response
to PARP inhibition in ovarian cancer. Thus, loss of the
tumor suppressor inositol polyphosphate 4-phosphatase
type II (INPP4B) results in a DNA repair defect due to
concomitant loss of BRCA1, ATR and ATM and can be
therapeutically targeted with PARP inhibitors.

median-centered signal intensities were plotted using
boxplots and differential gene expression was computed
using Welch two sample t-test. An univariate cox
proportional hazard regression model [39] was applied
to correlate gene expression of INPP4B with patient’s
survival in an invasive ductal breast carcinoma dataset of
n = 93 samples [40] and the Likelihood ratio test, Wald
test, and Score (log-rank) test were used to compute
P value (P < 15 × 10−4 for all three tests). Samples
obtained from survival analyses were ranked according
to INPP4B gene expression and Kaplan-Meier survival
curves were plotted for breast carcinomas with the
lowest 50th versus highest 50th percentile of INPP4B
expression giving a P value of 3 × 10−2 (log-rank test).

Adenovirus Cre recombinase (1 × 103pfu/ml Ad5CMVCreeGFP, Gene Transfer Vector Core, USA) overnight. For
protein degradation studies, cells were treated with 1 μM

Cells were lysed in Cell Signaling lysis buffer.
Western blotting was performed with the following
antibodies: Cell Signaling: INPP4B (#8450), phosphoAkt (Ser473) (#4060), Erk1/2 (#4695); Santa Cruz: PTEN

Microarray

RT-PCR

Total RNA from three independently generated
RNA preparations of MCF-10A shRNA-INPP4B or
shRNA-Renilla luciferase cells was hybridized according
to standard protocol required for Affymetrix U133 Plus
2.0 arrays at the BIDMC Genomics and Proteomics
Core (n = 3 per shRNA construct). Data pre-processing
and quality control were performed in R (http://www
.r-project.org/) and Bioconductor. Prior to any statistical
computation, data were normalized using gc-Robust
Multi-array Average (gcRMA) algorithm. Differentially
expressed genes were computed by empirical Bayes
(eBayes) shrinkage of standard errors toward a common
value approach [41] embedded within the Limma package.
P-values were adjusted for multiple comparisons using the
false discovery rate approach [42].
Unsupervised hierarchical clustering using the
Euclidean distance metric and complete linkage algorithm
was used to plot the differentially expressed genes with
an adjusted P value < 0.05. Gene ontology and pathway
enrichment analyses were performed using a classical
hypergeometric test and the gene ontologies or pathways
with the highest negative log (10) P value were plotted
[43]. Microarray data are available at the Gene Expression
Omnibus of the NCBI.

RNA was extracted using the RNeasy mini kit
(Qiagen). Power SYBR Green RNA-to-CT™ 1-Step Kit
(Applied Biosystem) was used with Mastercycler EP
