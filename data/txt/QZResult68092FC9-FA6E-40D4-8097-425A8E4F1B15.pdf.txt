ABSTRACT
Cancer invasion and metastasis is the most morbid aspect of cancer and is
governed by different cellular mechanisms than those driving the deregulated growth
of tumors. We addressed here the question of whether a common DNA methylation
signature of invasion exists in cancer cells from different origins that differentiates
invasive from non-invasive cells. We identified a common DNA methylation signature
consisting of hyper- and hypomethylation and determined the overlap of differences
in DNA methylation with differences in mRNA expression using expression array
analyses. A pathway analysis reveals that the hypomethylation signature includes
some of the major pathways that were previously implicated in cancer migration
and invasion such as TGF beta and ERBB2 triggered pathways. The relevance of
these hypomethylation events in human tumors was validated by identification of
the signature in several publicly available databases of human tumor transcriptomes.
We shortlisted novel invasion promoting candidates and tested the role of four
genes in cellular invasiveness from the list C11orf68, G0S2, SHISA2 and TMEM156
in invasiveness using siRNA depletion. Importantly these genes are upregulated in
human cancer specimens as determined by immunostaining of human normal and
cancer breast, liver and prostate tissue arrays. Since these genes are activated in
cancer they constitute a group of targets for specific pharmacological inhibitors of
cancer invasiveness.
SUMMARY: Our study provides evidence that common DNA hypomethylation
signature exists between cancer cells derived from different tissues, pointing to a
common mechanism of cancer invasiveness in cancer cells from different origins that
could serve as drug targets.

INTRODUCTION

We shortlisted the most robust differences in DNA
methylation between the cell line pairs; differential DNA
methylation of > 25% with p-value < 0.001. A hierar­
chical clustering analysis of the DNA methylation profiles
of all 6 cancer cell lines grouped the invasive cancer cell
lines MDA-MB-231, SKHep1 and PC3 in a common
branch suggesting that the invasive cell lines are more
similar to other invasive cell lines derived from a different
tissue than to their own cell-type non-invasive cancer cell
lines (Figure 1B). This is remarkable since the invasive
cells are derived from different cancer origins and exhibit
many different phenotypes. These data suggest a common
DNA methylation profile of invasiveness across different
cell types.
We then computed the overlap between the
differential DNA methylation signatures of the invasive
versus non-invasive breast, liver and prostate cancer cell
lines (Figure 1C). This analysis identifies a statistically
significant overlap between the invasion specific DNA
methylation signatures of the three cell types (Figure 1C).
The analysis revealed 5368 CpG sites in 2075 genes
that were significantly hypermethylated (p < 0.001)
and 2961 CpGs in 1356 genes that were significantly
hypomethylated (p < 0.001) in the three invasive cell
lines relative to their cell-type non-invasive counterparts.
Heatmap and hierarchical clustering of 5368 dif­
ferentially methylated CpGs between invasive cells and
their non-invasive counterparts, group invasive and noninvasive cancer cell lines in separate groups (Figure 2).
Supplementary Table S2 provide comprehensive list of
hypomethylated and hypermethylated sites. While most
of the differentially methylated CpG sites are found
in the open sea, 1172 hypermethylated sites (overlap
significance: P = 9 × 10 −198) and 542 hypomethylated
sites (overlap significance: P = 5.8 × 10 −159) are
positioned 5′ to the genes, and are candidates to play a
regulatory role in invasiveness. It is possible however
that the differentially methylated CpG sites found in
the open sea play other regulatory roles that are yet to
be described. Interestingly, almost half (47%, 1395 out
of 2961 CpG sites) (enrichment significance; P = 3.7
× 10 −266) of all hypomethylated CpG sites in invasive
cancer cell lines and 39% (2139 out of 5368 CpG sites)
of the hypermethylated CpG sites occur in enhancer
regions (enrichment significance; P = 7.3 × 10 −279) but
only 21% of CpGs in the Illumina 450K bead arrays are
found in enhancers. We validated by pyrosequencing 3
randomly selected genes (ANXA2, ELK3, PLEC1) from
the list of genes that were identified to be hypomethylated
in their 5′ or promoter regions in our genome wide
arrays in the invasive cells (Figure 3A, 3B, 3C). These 3
hypomethylated genes that were selected exhibited also
significantly increased expression in invasive cancer cell
lines as compared with the non-invasive counterparts as
determined by QPCR (Figure 3D).

Invasion and growth regulation in cancer are
distinctive processes and it stands to reason that they
involve different sets of gene expression alterations
driven by DNA methylation. A large body of studies
implicated changes in DNA methylation in cancer
[1–3]. The main focus has been on silencing of expression
through hypermethylation of tumor suppressor genes
and other genes that inhibit cancer progression. More
recently several studies implicated activation of gene
expression through hypomethylation of several prometastatic genes in breast [4], liver [5] and prostate cancer
[6]. A recent analysis of cancer methylomes revealed that
hypomethylation of CpG islands in breast cancer was
associated with high metastatic risk and death [7]. DNA
methylation profiles of cancer cells from different origins
differ widely from each other. However, it stands to reason
that fundamental mechanisms are shared amongst cancers
from different origins and these should be captured in
DNA methylation profiles even in cancer cell lines. In
this study we focused on cancer cell invasiveness. We
compared genome wide DNA methylation profiles of three
invasive cancer cell lines derived from breast, liver and
prostate cancers and their low invasive counterparts using
Illumina 450K bead arrays and identified a common DNA
methylation signature for invasive cell lines from different
origins. We then determined whether such a signature is
present in publicly available gene expression and DNA
methylation data of metastatic tumor clinical samples.
We shortlisted new genes that were not previously
described to be involved in cancer invasiveness and
selected 4 genes for further analysis by examining their
expression in cancer specimens and their role in cell
invasiveness using in vitro invasion assays following
shRNA knockdown. The results provide a proof of
principle for this approach for identifying common targets
for disrupting clinically relevant cancer phenotypes across
cancers from disparate origins.

RESULTS
Common DNA methylation signatures in
invasive prostate, breast and liver cancer cells
We compared the methylation profile of invasive
cancer cell lines (breast MDA-MB-231, liver SKHep1, and
prostate PC3) to their low-invasive counterparts (breast
MCF7, liver HepG2, and prostate LNCaP) (Figure 1A).
DNA from triplicate cultures (except LNCaP DNA, which
was extracted from duplicate cultures) was subjected to
whole genome DNA methylation analysis using Illumina
450K bead arrays as described in materials and methods.
The Illumina 450K data has been submitted to GEO under
accession number GSE71626.

Functional significance of Hypomethylated and
Hypermethylated CpG sites in invasive cancer
cell lines

8 genes (P = 5 × 10 − 3) that are involved in Epithelial
mesenchymal transitions (EMT) (Supplementary Table
S3A) including VIM (VIMENTIN) [8], ABL2/ARG involved
in defining the balance between proliferation and invasion
[9] in both cell culture and animal experiments, PAPPA
[10] a protease required for invasiveness of several cancer
cell lines, and uPA (urokinase), a well defined marker
of invasive tumor cells that is regulated by methylation
of its promoter region [11]. In general, the common
hypomethylated genes in invasive cancer cell lines are
known to be crucial for cell movement, proliferation,
migration and invasion (Supplementary Table S4).
235 genes included in the signature of commonly
hypomethylated genes in invasive cancer cells described
here were not previously shown to our knowledge to
be involved in cancer or cancer metastasis. However,
the biochemical function of these genes might suggest
possible involvement in cancer. For example 16 genes

We analyzed using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis
(IPA) which gene networks, functional categories and
canonical pathways are commonly differentially methylated
in invasive cells across different cell types using a
cutoff of a differential DNA methylation of at least 25%
(Supplementary Table S2). Surprisingly, hypermethylated
genes are organized in functional pathways that are only
remotely related to cancer metastasis (Table 1). Remarkably,
however the common hypomethylated landscape reveals
some of the nodal pathways and regulators known to
be involved in cancer metastasis (Table 1). The second
biological function category after cancer includes cell
movement (P = 5.18 × 10 −13) one of the most important
properties of cancer metastasis. That category includes

(Supplementary Table S3B) were shown to be involved in
TGF beta pathway that is known to drive cancer metastasis
[12]. These data support the hypothesis that common DNA
methylation changes underlie the invasive phenotype
across diverse cell types and that these common DNA
methylation signatures capture genes that are critical for
the invasive phenotype in many cancers.
To get further insight into the functional organization
of the hypomethylation signature we examined putative
upstream regulators of the commonly hypomethylated
genes. The list includes downstream effectors of prime
drivers of cancer, such as HRAS, and cancer metastasis,
such as TGF beta. The involvement of TGF beta pathway
in driving cancer metastasis, particularly breast cancer
metastasis has been widely documented in the last two
and a half decades [13, 14]. There is evidence that TGF

www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

beta stimulates EMT transition, the primary process
converting non-invasive epithelial cells into invasive
carcinoma [15, 16]. Interestingly, a careful examination
of the list of hypomethylated genes that are targets of TGF
beta reveals 5 genes (PLAU, PLAUR, SMAD3, STAT3 and
VIM) involved in EMT transition (reviewed in [17]).
Another notable upstream regulator is the receptor
tyrosine kinase ERBB2 (HER2) [18]. Thousands of
publications have implicated this protein in breast cancer
metastasis. HER2 overexpression occurring in aggressive
metastatic breast cancer, is the principal somatic
amplification/overexpression [19] known to be a marker of
disease outcome and therapeutic response in breast cancer
[20, 21] and a target of approved drugs for the treatment
of metastatic breast cancer [22–24]. Interestingly ERBB2
itself is not differentially methylated.

invasive cancer cell lines was determined by qPCR (see Materials and Methods). Experiment was performed at least three times in all three
cell lines. Expression level of target genes was normalized to GAPDH rRNA values. Due to differences in the expression levels between
the cell lines, the maximal expression level between replicates in invasive cells was matched to 1. The calculated ratios of invasive to noninvasive in all three type of cell lines were highly reproducible (see error bars).

Validation of the relevance of the
hypomethylation signature to clinical samples

the list of differentially methylated genes between
invasive (MDA-MB-231) and non-invasive (MCF7)
breast cancer cells and the154 differentially methylated
genes between DCIS and IDC. We couldn’t find data
for differentially methylated genes between invasive
and non-invasive cancers in liver and prostate tumors
in the public domain.
Hypomethylation of 5' UTR of genes is believed
to be associated with activation of gene expression.
We therefore examined the overlap between the list
of hypomethylated genes in invasive cancer cell
lines and genes upregulated in tumor gene expression
databases. A comparison of the list of hypomethylated
genes (P < 0.05, delta beta < − 0.25) in invasive PC3

overlap (p-value = 0.03) of 26 genes (Table S5) when
we compared our list of the common signature of
differentially methylated genes in invasive cancer cell

between DCIS (ductal carcinoma in situ) and IDC

significant (p-value = 9 × 10 − 07) results (114 common
genes) were obtained (Table S5), when we compared

cancer (accession in ArrayExpress: E-GEOD-3325)
[26] reveals an overlap of 1440 genes (p-value = 1.21

PC3 prostate cancer cell lines and are overexpressed
in invasive prostate cancer (Supplementary Table S6).
Similarly, 199 genes that are hypomethylated in MDAMB-231 cells vs. MCF-7 cells are included in a list of

in public released data.
In summary, these analyses suggest that the
approach that we have taken in this study identifies
important genes for invasiveness in tumor samples and is
not limited to cell culture conditions.

beadchip arrays data has been submitted to GEO under
accession number GSE71625. For prostate cancer cell
lines (PC3 and LNCaP), we used publicly available data
(GSE36531) [28]. We found 95 significantly (P-value 0.05,
larger than twofold difference) downregulated and 209
upregulated genes in all three invasive cancer cell lines
compared to non invasive cancer cell lines (Figure  1D).
We determined the overlap between genes that were
hypomethylated in 5′UTR regions and upregulated genes
in invasive compared to non-invasive cancer cell lines.
We found significant (p-value = 3.65 × 10 − 45) overlap of
76 RefSeq genes including isoforms covering 69 genes
between the hypomethylated and overexpressed genes in
invasive cancer cell lines (Figure 1E) (For the whole list
see Supplementary Table S7). 31 out of these 76 genes
are known to be involved in metastasis, while 46 to our
knowledge were not reported previously to be involved in
metastasis formation.
To provide a proof of principle that the list of
genes that are commonly hypomethylated and induced
in 3 invasive cancer cell lines could serve as a source
for discovery of new genes involved in invasiveness,
we picked four genes, C11orf68, G0S2, SHISA2 and
TMEM156.
These genes were chosen for the following
reasons. First, to our knowledge they were not
previously reported to be involved in cell invasiveness.
Second, differences in expression of these genes were
robust (P value < 0.001). Third, the biological function
of two out of the four genes (C11orf68-Basophilic
Leukemia-Expressed Protein and TMEM156) was
unknown. G0S2 is G0/G1switch 2 protein, known to

Discovery of new candidate genes involved in cell
invasiveness

that were also differentially expressed between the
invasive and non-invasive cancer cell lines by subjecting

SKHep1 cells to expression analyses using the Illunima

differentiation [30], inflammation [31], and lipid
metabolism [32] in various cellular settings. SHISA2
plays an essential role in the maturation of presomitic
mesoderm cells by individual attenuation of both FGF
and WNT signaling [33]. Steady state mRNA levels
of C11orf68, G0S2, SHISA2 and TMEM156 were
significantly upregulated in invasive MDA-MB-231,
SKHep1 and PC3 cell lines compared to their noninvasive counterparts as validated by QPCR (Figure 4)
and their promoters were hypomethylated as validated
by pyrosequencing (Figure 4). (Please note, that due to
the lack of TMEM156 antibody suitable for western blot
analysis, we were not able to test this gene).

We determined whether these genes were
overexpressed in clinical cancer biopsies in comparison
with cancer adjacent normal and/or normal tissues by
immuno-histochemistry using specific antibodies targeted
against these proteins (Figure 4) (for details, please see
Material and Methods).
The vast majority of our clinical samples were from
invasive cancers and we were only able to determine the
expression of the proteins in invasive cancer compared
to normal and normal adjacent tissues. (Please note,
that due to the lack of G0S2 antibody available for
immunostaining, we were not able to test this gene).

These data suggest that the selected three proteins
are overexpressed in some but not all invasive tumor types
that were analyzed.

DISCUSSION
Conversion of non-invasive cancer cells to invasive
cells is a critical step in metastasis that alters the course
and morbidity of the disease. Breast cancer as well as other
cancer types are heterogeneous and include many cell
subtypes with clear variances in gene expression programs
and DNA methylation signatures [34–36]. In spite of this
tremendous heterogeneity, invasive cancers that originated
from different tissues share common fundamental
biological mechanisms. These common mechanisms could
provide broad-spectrum diagnostic tools and therapeutic
targets. Since several of these mechanisms might be
epigenetically controlled we developed an approach to
identify common DNA methylation signatures of cancer
invasiveness. We previously used DNA hypomethylation
signatures to identify new target genes in hepatocellular
carcinoma [37]. We reasoned that if such a common
signature of invasiveness exists, it should be revealed
by comparing human metastatic cancer cell lines from
different origins to their non-invasive counterparts.
Contrary to tumor specimens, cell lines contain a
single cell type and could potentially reveal relatively
homogenous and unconfounded DNA methylation profiles
of highly invasive cells that would not be revealed in DNA
methylation profiles of tumor specimens. We realized that
cells in culture will acquire DNA methylation signatures
that could be driven by stochastic events under culture
conditions and that cells derived from different tissue
origins will have different patterns of methylation.
However, we reasoned that since these different cell lines
exhibit a common phenotype, invasiveness, they should
share common pathways that drive this phenotype through
similar changes in DNA methylation. Such overlapping
changes in different cell lines from different cellular
origins and history in culture are highly unlikely to be
caused by idiosyncrasies of the cell lines but most probably
reflect the fundamental processes of invasiveness. Thus,
the strategy utilized in this study effectively subtracts the
background DNA methylation patterns associated with
tissue specificity and culture conditions as well as growth
and apoptosis to deliver an “invasion specific” signature.
In addition, in contrast to cell growth programming that
is under significant selection pressure in culture, there is
no reason to believe that there is any selection pressure
for pro-invasive genes or invasive phenotypes. Indeed

Functional testing of the role of hypomethylated
gene in invasiveness of cancer cells
To test whether C11orf68, G0S2, SHISA2 and
TMEM156 are required for the invasive phenotype of
breast MDA-MB-231, liver SKHep1and prostate PC3
cancer cell lines, we used stable shRNA-mediated
depletion of these genes with lentiviral particles expressing
shRNA directed against these 4 genes (3 different pools
of stable infected cells were tested per shRNA construct).
The shRNA depleted cell lines showed reduced expression
of the genes at both mRNA and protein levels as confirmed
by QPCR and western blot (Figure 6A, 6B, 6C, 6D).
Trypan blue-excluding cells were quantified using a
hemocytometer, and an equal amount of viable cells were
plated per group in Boyden chambers to measure in vitro
invasiveness (see Material and Methods for details).
Depletion of C11orf68 (Figure 6A) resulted in
inhibition of invasiveness in breast MDA-MB-231 and
liver SKHep1 cell lines but not in PC3 prostate cancer
cells. G0S2 and SHISA2 (Figure 6B, 6C) depletion caused
significant reduction in invasiveness in all three invasive
cell lines and knockdown of TMEM156 had an effect
on invasiveness only in SKHep1 cells (Figure 6D). In
summary, knockdown of all 4 genes results in inhibition of
invasiveness in at least one of the three invasive cell lines.
To exclude an impact of RNAi on cell viability
that may confound the invasive assay results, we plated
the treated cells concurrently on similar wells but in
absence of the Matrigel-coated membrane and performed
cell Trypan blue cell viability assay. We did not observe
any significant effect on cell viability by knockdown of

SHISA2 plays an essential role in the maturation of
presomitic mesoderm cells by attenuation of both FGF and
WNT signaling [33]. SHISA2 was reported recently to be
overexpressed in high-grade prostate cancer cells and to be
involved in aggressive phenotype of prostate cancer [40].
Interestingly, CpG island within SHISA2 promoter has also
been reported to be hypomethylated in recurrent tumors
in comparison with non-recurrent tumors [41]. SHISA2
staining in prostate adenocarcinoma confirms previous
observations of SHISA2 activation in prostate aggressive
cancer [40]. The other genes that were examined,
TMEM156 and C11orf68, to our knowledge were never
shown to have biochemical or cellular role that could be
linked to cancer.
Our findings show the relevance of hypomethylation
in metastatic cancer, which can have important therapeutic
implications. Most of the past literature in the field of
cancer focused on identifying methylated and silenced
genes. However, silenced genes that suppress cancer
could only be activated by epigenetic manipulations but
these are not specific to the silenced genes and exert
general effects such as inducing cancer-promoting genes.
Our strategy identifies genes that are reprogrammed by
hypomethylation and activated in metastatic cancer.
Specific inhibitors could block the proteins encoded by
these genes. These would target metastatic cancer and
thus serve as novel drug targets in cancer metastasis
treatment. The strategy applied in this manuscript could
therefore allow the identification of common diagnostics
of metastatic cancer, common mechanisms, as well as
common drug targets. However, it is clear that these
need to be tested in clinical samples as the complexities
of tumor progression in vivo might result in altered role
for such proteins as seen in our study and only a subset
of these candidates would evolve to become broad scope
targets in metastatic cancer.

our data suggest that the genes selected by our approach
are not required for cell growth (Figure 6) and thus don’t
confer growth advantage and therefore were probably not
artificially “selected” under the culture conditions.
Our analysis revealed a strong highly significant
common DNA methylation signature that differentiates
invasive from non-invasive cancer cells in spite of their
vastly different tissues of origin. Two main lines of
evidence suggest that these signatures are closely relevant
to cancer metastasis. First, a pathway analysis performed
by IPA reveals that many of the hypomethylated genes
are members of functional gene pathways with strong
experimental and clinical relevance to cancer. For
example, molecular cellular functions include the
following pathways, cellular growth and proliferation
(191 genes out of 542 hypomethylated genes in invasive
cancer cell lines; p-value range of 5.40E-14 - 4.22E03) and cellular movement (128 genes out of 542;
p-value range of 5.18E-13 - 4.03E-03). Second, we
found a strong overlap between DNA hypomethylation
of 5′UTR in metastatic cancer cell lines and induction of
expression in clinical metastatic cancer samples which
supports the functional role for DNA hypomethylation in
cancer metastasis. Third, the hypomethylated genes in our
signature are downstream to upstream regulators that have
been implicated in cancer metastasis in numerous different
studies (e.g., TGFB1, ERBB2). Fourth, knockdown of
four genes from the list of hypomethylated genes, that
were not assigned a role in metastasis to date, resulted
in inhibition of invasiveness in vitro in at least one of
three tested invasive cell types. Fifth, immunochemistry
in clinical cancer samples and normal tissues reveals
differential expression of three of the proteins in either
breast, liver or prostate cancer (Table 2). Although
all three tested proteins clearly differentiate all tested
invasive cell lines from their non-invasive counterparts,
the situation in vivo is more complex as expected due to
heterogeneity of tumor biopsies.
The four genes that were examined in detail have
not been previously reported to play a role in metastasis
although two of these genes exhibit activities that suggest
a role in invasiveness. G0S2, a G0/G1switch 2 protein,
was recently reported to be a novel pro-apoptotic
factor, which is induced upon tumor necrosis factor
alpha (TNFα) treatment, whose activation also required
NF-κB. G0S2 promotes apoptosis by interacting with
Bcl-2 and by preventing the formation of protective Bcl2/Bax heterodimers [29]. Moreover, G0S2 was reported
to be regulated by DNA methylation (hypermethylation)
in squamous lung carcinoma [38] and to exhibit antiproliferative activity in K562 erythroleukemia cells [39].
By contrast, we observe significant G0S2 hypomethylation
and induction in breast, liver and prostate invasive cancer
cell lines (Figure 4D) that suggests the opposite role for
this protein in these three cancer types.

In vitro Invasion assay

Beadchips were washed also according to Illumina’s WholeGenome Gene Expression Direct Hybridization Assay Guide
and scanned on an Illumina iScan Reader.
Protein extraction, Western blot analysis were
performed as described before [37]. Polyclonal antibodies
to C11orf68, SHISA2 and TMEM156 were purchased from
Abcam (ab103656, ab107724, ab122047 consequently),
for G0S2 from USBiological (G8577-80A). Monoclonal
antibodies to β-actin and α-Tubulin were purchased from
Sigma Aldrich Co. (Cat#A5316, #T9026 consequently).
Anti rabbit secondary antibody was purchased from
Sigma Aldrich Co. (Cat#A0545) and anti mouse from
Amersham Biosciences (Uppsala, Sweden) (final antibody
concentration was according to the manufacturer’s
recommendation).

Boyden chamber Matrigel Cell invasion assays were
performed following the manufacturers protocol (Chemicon,
Billerica, MA). Briefly, 3 × 105 cells in serum-free media
were plated for each treatment condition in the upper
chamber containing the Matrigel-coated membranes. Serumcontaining media acted as chemo-attractants in the lower
chambers. After incubation for 48 h, the invaded cells at the
bottom of the membrane were stained and counted under a
light microscope with X400 magnification. All experiments
were performed in triplicates.

Trypan blue cell viability assay
Cell viability was determined by the Trypan blue
(Sigma-Aldrich) exclusion test. ShRNAs treated cells were
plated in 24-well plates in triplicate. After 48 hours cells
were trypsinized and stained with trypan blue. Viable and
non-viable cells were counted under a light microscope. The
fraction of viable cell was determined by dividing live cells
(non-stained) by total cells (both trypan blue positive and
negative)

shRNA Treatment
To suppress C11ORF68, G0S2, SHISA2 and TMEM156
genes we used lentivirus-mediated human pGIPZ shRNA
plasmids and control pGIPZ-scrambled shRNA (Open
Biosystems) (Supplementary Table S1). Lentiviruses
were assembled using the following three vectors: GFP
expression pGIPZ transfer vector—includes the insert (Open
Biosystems); pMD2.G (VSV-G envelope expressing plasmid);
PAX (packaging plasmid). The day before transfection,
106 HEK293T cells were plated in a 10 cm dish (20–30%
confluence). Next day, 5 μg of each vector were transfected
using FuGene HD transfection reagent (Roche) according to
the manufacturer’s protocol. Cells were incubated for 48 h
followed by collection of the medium containing the virus,
filtered and used to infect the target cells. Selection with 1 mg/
ml puromycin (Sigma) was started after 48 h postinfection. The
rationale for using one of the shRNAs was based on knockdown
efficiency in the specific cell line. The following (most efficient)
shRNAs knockdowns were used for downstream experiments:
C11orf68 in MDA-MB-231 was targeted with ShC11orf68#5
and ShC11orf68#6, in SKHep1 with ShC11orf68#6 and
ShC11orf68#7 and in PC3 with ShC11orf68#8. G0S2 in
MDA-MB-231was targeted with ShG0S2#6, in SKHep1with
ShG0S2#6 and ShG0S2#7 and in PC3 with ShG0S2#6.
SHISA2 in MDA-MB-231 was targeted with ShSHISA2#3 in
SKHep1 with ShSHISA2#2 and ShSHISA2#3 and in PC3 with
ShSHISA2#3. TMEM156 in MDA-MB-231 was targeted with
ShTMEM#10, in SKHep1 and in PC3 with ShTMEM156#3
(please see Table S1 for sequences)

Illumina 450K whole genome analysis
Genomic DNA was quantified using Picogreen
protocol (Quant-iT™ PicoGreen® dsDNA Products,
Invitrogen, P-7589) and read on SpectraMAXGeminiXS
Spectrophotometer. Bisulfate conversion was performed with
500 ng of genomic DNA using the EZ-96 DNA MethylationGold Kit (Zymo Research, D5007).
The Illumina Methylation 450K kit was used for the
microarray experiment, as described by the manufacturer’s
protocol, except that 8μl of bisulfate converted material was
utilized to initiate the amplification step. Hybridization and
scanning was performed at the Genome Quebec Center.
Data analysis was performed with the Methylation
module (version 1.9.0) of the GenomeStudio software
(Illumina; version 2011.1) usingHumanMethylation450_15
017482_v.1.2.bpm manifest.

Illumina HT12 expression bead array
Total RNA from MCF7, MDA-MB-231, HepG2
and SKHep1cell lines was quantified using a NanoDrop
Spectrophotometer ND-1000 (NanoDrop Technologies,
Inc.) and its integrity was assessed using a 2100 Bioanalyzer
(Agilent Technologies). Double stranded cDNA was
synthesized from (250ng) of total RNA, and in vitro
transcription was performed to produce biotin-labeled cRNA
using Illumina® TotalPrep RNA Amplification Kit, according
to manufacturer’s instructions (Life Technologies). The
labeled cRNA was then normalized at (250ng) and hybridized
on (Human HT-12_v4 arrays) according to Illumina’s WholeGenome Gene Expression Direct Hybridization Assay Guide.
The BeadChips were incubated in an Ilumina Hybridization
oven at 58°C for 14 to 20 hours at a rocking speed of 5.

Statistical and bioinformatics method
GenomeStudio (V2011.1) Methylation module (1.9.0)
and Expression module (1.9.0) software was used to generate
heatmaps and perform statistical analysis for Illumina 450K
methylation BeadChip array and Illumina HT12 BeadChip.
Significant difference in methylation levels between invasive
and non-invasive cancer cells was corrected for multiple
testing using a False Discovery Rate (FDR) adjusted
to P < 0.05. For expression analysis we used Quantile
normalization, diffscore more than 13 or less than −13. At

for further analysis.
The Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) program
(http://www.ingenuity.com/index. html) was used to
identify the potential affected gene networks, functional
categories, canonical pathways and upstream regulators.
Heatmap on Figure 2 was created by the use of
Gene E (http://www.broadinstitute.org/cancer/software/

Statistical analysis of pyrosequencing, QPCR,
invasion assay and cell viability assays was performed
using an unpaired t test with two tailed distribution. The
results were considered statistically significant when
P < 0.05.

FLEX Peroxidase-Blocking Reagent (Dako) was used
as blocking reagent. As secondary antibodies, Dextran
coupled with peroxidase molecules and goat secondary
antibody molecules against rabbit immunoglobulins
in buffered solution containing stabilizing protein and
preservative (Envision™ FLEX/HRP, Dako) was used
for 30 minutes. 3,3′-diaminobenzidine tetrachloride,
Envision™ FLEX DAB+ Chromogen (Dako) and buffered
solution containing hydrogen peroxide and preservative
(Envision™ FLEX Substrate buffer, Dako) were added.
Counterstaining was done with hematoxylin (1a Harris
hematoxylin solution by MERCK KGaA, Darmstadt,
Germany). After every step, sections were washed twice
for 10 minutes in Tris buffered saline solution containing
Tween 20, pH7.6, (Envision™ FLEX Wash Buffer, Dako)
at 1:20 dilution. Mounting of the slides was done with
DPX (MERCK KGaA).
Two pathologists independently scored all tissue
array cores for the proportion and intensity of staining of
tissues. A score of 0–3 was assigned to each core based on
the intensity of staining from negative to strong, and score
of 0–7 was given based on the percentage of cells showing
positive staining. Both these scores were combined to get
a total score.

RNA extraction, reverse transcription (RT) and
quantitave polymerase chain reaction (QPCR)
Total RNA was isolated using TRIzol (Invitrogen,
Life Technologies) according to the manufacturer's
protocol. RT was performed using 1 μg of RNA and
20U avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase
(Roche), as recommended by the manufacturer and
QPCR was performed in a Roche LightCycler LC480. For
quantification and normalization, the results were analyzed
by the Roche LightCycler 480 software.
