Abstract
Thermal ablation to destroy tumor tissue may help activate tumor-speciﬁc T cells by elevating the presentation
of tumor antigens to the immune system. However, the antitumor activity of these T cells may be restrained by
their expression of the inhibitory T-cell coreceptor CTLA-4, the target of the recently U.S. Food and Drug
Administration–approved antibody drug ipilumimab. By relieving this restraint, CTLA-4–blocking antibodies
such as ipilumimab can promote tumor rejection, but the full scope of their most suitable applications has yet to
be fully determined. In this study, we offer a preclinical proof-of-concept in the TRAMP C2 mouse model of
prostate cancer that CTLA-4 blockade cooperates with cryoablation of a primary tumor to prevent the outgrowth
of secondary tumors seeded by challenge at a distant site. Although growth of secondary tumors was unaffected by
cryoablation alone, the combination treatment was sufﬁcient to slow growth or trigger rejection. In addition,
secondary tumors were highly inﬁltrated by CD4þ T cells and CD8þ T cells, and there was a signiﬁcant increase in
the ratio of intratumoral T effector cells to CD4þFoxP3þ T regulatory cells, compared with monotherapy. These
ﬁndings documented for the ﬁrst time an effect of this immunotherapeutic intervention on the intratumoral
accumulation and systemic expansion of CD8þ T cells speciﬁc for the TRAMP C2–speciﬁc antigen SPAS-1.
Although cryoablation is currently used to treat a targeted tumor nodule, our results suggest that combination
therapy with CTLA-4 blockade will augment antitumor immunity and rejection of tumor metastases in this
setting. Cancer Res; 72(2); 430–9. 2011 AACR.

Introduction
Thermal ablation treatments such as cryoablation have
emerged as alternatives to surgical resection to treat many
types of inoperable tumors, including prostate, kidney, liver,
bone, adrenal, and lung. Cryoablation involves the insertion of
a probe into a tumor nodule to administer tissue ablative
freezing temperatures (1). Its mechanism of action has been
attributed to the mechanical forces of crystallization, the
osmotic changes due to crystallization, and the ischemic
effects of microvascular injury (2). Furthermore, as an
image-guided, needle-based technique, it can be administered

percutaneously, making it less invasive than traditional surgery
(3, 4). As a result, it is associated with decreased morbidity and
mortality and is more cost effective when compared with
conventional therapies such as surgical resection (5).
Following ablation, the necrotic tumor lesion remains within the body, and it has been hypothesized that the release of
tumor antigens by dying cells could activate a tumor-speciﬁc
immune response through antigen presentation by antigenpresenting cells (APC) to T cells. This antigen release is
potentially signiﬁcant because, although ablative procedures
are very effective in eradicating the targeted tumor nodule, a
tumor-speciﬁc immune response may facilitate elimination of
distant metastases and prevent recurrent disease. Although a
few cases of spontaneous remission of metastases following
cryoablation have been reported (6), studies in patients and
animal models have revealed weak or absent immune
responses after ablation (7), despite the massive release of
proteins resulting from tumor cell death observed in animal
models (8). It has, therefore, been proposed that the immune
response could be augmented if cryoablation is combined with
immunotherapies that target APCs or modulate T-cell function. A number of tumor studies combining immunomodulation, such as injection of toll-like receptor agonists, with
cryoablation have shown a synergistic effect on tumor rejection, and this was attributed to enhanced activation of APC
function (9, 10). Here, we investigate how immunotherapies

CTLA-4 Blockade and Cryoablation Combination Immunotherapy

that target the inhibitory pathways in T cells can potentially
synergize with cryoablation to generate systemic antitumor
immunity.
Monoclonal antibodies (mAb) that block the function of
CTLA-4, a transmembrane protein expressed by activated T
cells, are a promising new therapy to treat cancer. CTLA-4
inhibits the activation of self-reactive T cells, and it was
proposed many years ago that blockade of this pathway, could
enhance T-cell responses to tumors. Indeed, in preclinical
studies, CTLA-4 blockade led to rejection of immunogenic
tumors such as 51Blim10 colon carcinoma and SA/1N ﬁbrosarcoma (11). In additional animal studies, rejection of less
immunogenic tumors was achieved when CTLA-4 blockade
was combined with a cellular vaccine, or radiation therapy,
which likely increase the efﬁciency of antigen presentation
(12–15). Studies in mouse models of prostate cancer have
shown decreased metastatic lesions and a reduction of primary
tumor incidence when CTLA-4 blockade was combined with
surgical resection or a granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) secreting tumor vaccine, respectively
(16, 17). In addition, CTLA-4 blockade was shown to synergize
with thermal ablation in protection of B16 melanoma tumor
growth in a prophylactic setting (8, 18).
Clinical trials to validate the efﬁcacy of anti–CTLA-4 mAb
(anti–CTLA-4) therapy in humans have been completed or are
currently underway for the treatment of various cancers
including melanoma, prostate, and renal cancer. Clinical trials
in prostate cancer patients have shown improved results when
CTLA-4 blockade was combined with a GM-CSF secreting
tumor vaccine (GVAX; refs. 19, 20). Furthermore, a phase III
trial of unresectable stage III and IV melanoma patients
showed anti–CTLA-4 therapy (Ipilimumab; Bristol MeyersSquibb) to improve the median survival time to 10 months
compared with 6.4 months in the control group (21), and this
work led to the recent approval of this therapy by the U.S. Food
and Drug Administration. This was the ﬁrst drug of any type to
show survival beneﬁt in metastatic melanoma in a blinded,
randomized phase III trial. Notably, approximately 25% of the
patients had durable responses lasting 2 years and more. Thus,
this therapy holds promise for metastatic melanoma patients
who have failed the ﬁrst line therapies and for whom there is
currently no other approved treatment. Whereas these results
were obtained using anti–CTLA-4 as monotherapy, the current
hypothesis is that an even more substantial extension of
patient survival in a larger fraction of patients may be achieved
when this checkpoint blockade is combined with other treatment modalities that promote tumor destruction and subsequent antigen presentation.
In this article, we test the synergistic effect of CTLA-4
blockade on preventing the development of a secondary tumor
when administered in combination with cryoablation of a large
primary tumor using the transplantable TRAMP C2 tumor
model of metastatic prostate cancer. We report that, in contrast to cryoablation or CTLA-4 blockade alone, the combination therapy slowed or prevented growth of a majority of
secondary tumors. Rejection of the second tumor was associated with inﬁltration or expansion of CD4þ and CD8þ effector
T cells, as well as an increase in the T effector (Teff) to T

regulatory cell (Treg) ratio within the secondary tumor. Importantly, endogenous CD8þ T cells speciﬁc for the TRAMP tumor
antigen SPAS-1 (22) were enriched in both secondary tumors
and spleens of combination-treated mice compared with controls. Elimination of CD8þ T cells using depleting antibodies
showed that CD8þ T cells are important for rejection, implying
that SPAS-1–speciﬁc T cells contribute to the rejection of
TRAMP C2 tumors during immunotherapy. These results
suggest that cryoablation, although not effective on its own,
can mediate the rejection of metastatic lesions and prevent
recurrent disease when combined with CTLA-4 blockade.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture, media, and mice
TRAMP C2 cells were obtained from N. M. Greenburg
(Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX) in 1999 (23). The
cells were periodically authenticated by morphologic inspection and tested negative in 2004 for microbial contamination
using the mouse antibody production test. The cells tested
negative for Mycoplasma contamination by PCR test in 2008.
TRAMP C2 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modiﬁed Eagle's
medium high glucose supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum
(FCS; Mediatech, Inc.), 5% Nu Serum IV (BD Biosciences)
HEPES, 2-ME, pen/strep, L-glut, 5 mg/mL insulin (Sigma), and
10 nmol/L DHT (Sigma). Seven- to 9-week-old male C57BL/6
mice were purchased from Taconic Farms. Mice were used for
experiments no earlier than 1 week after arrival. Mice were
bred, housed, and treated according to the approved institutional animal protocols. Mice were injected with 200 mg anti–
CTLA-4 (clone 9H10 BioXCell) or hamster IgG isotype control
antibodies (BioXCell) in 0.2 mL PBS intraperitoneally on day 1
and 100 mg on days 4, 7, and 10 (Fig. 1A). For CD8þ T-cell
depletion 0.5 mg of anti-CD8 (clone 2.43; BioXCell) was injected
intraperitoneally 4 days prior to tumor injection and 4 and 14
days after tumor injection.
Antibodies, tetramer, and ﬂow cytometry
Cells were blocked with 50 mg/mL 24.G2 (MSKCC mAb core)
and stained with surface antibodies or tetramer for 60 minutes
on ice. Antibodies were used at a 1:100 dilution, whereas the
tetramer was used at a ﬁnal concentration of 1.1 mg/mL.
Antibodies detecting the following surface proteins were used:
CD4 PerCP (clone RM4-5; BD Pharmingen), CD4 APC (Clone
GK1; eBioscience) CD8 paciﬁc blue or PE (clone 53-6.7;
eBioscience), CD44 APC (clone IM7; eBioscience). The SPAS1 H-2 Db tetramer PE was generated by the MSKCC tetramer
core facility. The FoxP3 staining set (eBioscience) was used
according to the manufacturer's instructions using anti-FoxP3
APC (clone FJK-16s; eBioscience) 1:100 in perm/wash buffer for
60 minutes on ice. The cells were analyzed on an LSR II (BD
Biosciences) ﬂow cytometer. Flow cytometry data were further
analyzed with FlowJo (Treestar, Inc.)
ELISPOT
IFNg ELISPOT kits (BD Biosciences) containing plates, coating antibody, detection antibody, and streptavidin–horseradish
peroxidase enzyme were used according to the manufacturer's

CTLA-4 Blockade and Cryoablation Combination Immunotherapy

Preparation of single-cell suspensions of tumor
inﬁltrates
Mice were sacriﬁced by CO2 inhalation and the inside of the
skin containing the tumor was exposed. Tumors were removed
using forceps and surgical scissors and weighed. Tumors from
each group were pooled and minced with scissors prior to
incubation with 1.67 W€
unsch U/mL Liberase and 0.2 mg/mL
DNase for 30 minutes at 37 C. Tumors were homogenized by
repeated pipetting and ﬁltered through a 70-mm nylon ﬁlter.
Remaining tumor pieces were pushed through the ﬁlter using
the end of a 1-mL syringe. Cell suspensions were washed once
with complete RPMI and ﬁcolled. Live cells at the interface
were collected and counted for further analysis.
Cryoablation
Mice were inoculated with 1  106 TRAMP C2 cells on the
left ﬂank as described. Tumors were cryoablated when they
reached 5 to 8 mm in diameter, about 28 days after tumor
inoculation. The mice were anesthetized with a mixture of 100
mg/kg ketamine and 10 mg/kg xylazine. The mice were surgically prepped by shaving the targeted area and cleansing it
with alternating povidone iodine scrub and 70% alcohol rinse.
A cryoablation probe (Endocare 1.7-mm PerCryo Cryoprobe)
was inserted into the tumor and freezing was administered for
1 to 2 minutes to less than 100 C at the needle hub. After the
ablation, the site was monitored for bleeding or any other post
procedural complications. Standard recovery procedures were
implemented.
Statistical analysis
Statistical signiﬁcance was calculated using Prism 5.0
(GraphPad Software, Inc.).

Results
Cryoablation and CTLA-4 blockade synergize to mediate
the rejection of a subsequent TRAMP C2 tumor challenge
We developed a model system to test the capacity of cryoablation and anti–CTLA-4 combination therapy to generate
sufﬁcient immunity to slow or reject a second tumor challenge.
To this end, we injected TRAMP C2 tumor cells on the left ﬂank
of male B6 mice and administered cryoablation when it reached
5 to 8 mm in diameter, about 28 days after injection (Fig. 1A). To
model recurrent disease due to the outgrowth of a micrometastatic lesion, the following day, mice were challenged with a
second injection of TRAMP C2 on the opposite ﬂank. We
monitored the growth of secondary tumors in mice treated
with cryoablation and anti–CTLA-4 combination therapy (Cryo
þ Anti–CTLA-4), mice treated with cryoablation plus hamster
IgG isotype control antibodies (Cryo þ IgG), mice that received
only the secondary tumor implant and anti–CTLA-4 monotherapy (Anti–CTLA-4 Only), and mice that received only the
secondary tumor implant with no further treatment (no treatment). Mice treated with only anti–CTLA-4 or cryoablation
plus IgG grew secondary tumors at a similar rate compared
with untreated controls (Fig. 1B). In contrast, cryoablation and
anti–CTLA-4 combination therapy led to slower outgrowth or
rejection of the second tumor (Fig. 1B). Similarly, although

www.aacrjournals.org

100% of the untreated, anti–CTLA-4 only and cryoablation plus
IgG-treated mice succumbed to progressive growth of the
second tumor, combination treatment led to rejection by
44% of the mice (Fig. 1C). Our results indicate that, although
cryoablation alone does not inﬂuence the growth of a second
tumor challenge, when it is combined with CTLA-4 blockade,
induction of sufﬁcient immunity leads to tumor rejection.
Secondary tumors from cryoablation/anti–CTLA-4
combination-treated mice are inﬁltrated by CD8þ and
CD4þ T cells
To identify the T cell types that mediate rejection of the
secondary tumors in our system, we isolated the tumors and
assayed them for T-cell inﬁltration by immunoﬂuorescence
staining and ﬂow cytometry. T-cell inﬁltration into contralateral tumors was assessed 15 days after implantation of
TRAMP C2 tumors into naive or cryoablation-treated mice.
Cryosections of secondary tumors were stained with antiCD4 and anti-CD8 antibodies to determine the types of T
cells that inﬁltrated the tumor. In addition, anti-CD31, a
marker of endothelial cells was used to stain the tumor
vasculature. Immunoﬂuorescence staining of untreated
tumors revealed limited T-cell inﬁltration (Fig. 2A left panel). In contrast, secondary tumors from combination-treated
mice were highly inﬁltrated by both CD8þ and CD4þ T cells
(Fig. 2A right panel).
To better quantify the T cells that we observed by immunoﬂuorescence, we evaluated T-cell inﬁltration by ﬂow cytometry. On day 15, TRAMP C2 tumors were very small due to the
slow growth of this tumor model. Therefore, to obtain enough
tumor material to analyze by ﬂow cytometry, we increased the
tumor inoculum to 1  106 TRAMP C2 cells and pooled 6
tumors from each group. Tumors from untreated, anti–CTLA4 only, or cryoablation plus IgG-treated mice contained smaller
percentages of CD4þ T cells, compared with combinationtreated tumors (Fig. 2B). Anti–CTLA-4 treatment alone, or
when combined with cryoablation resulted in an increased
percentage CD8þ T cells within the secondary tumor (Fig. 2B).
When absolute cell numbers and the mass of the pooled
tumors were accounted for in the analysis, the total CD8þ T
cells per mg of tumor in combination-treated mice increased 2fold over anti–CTLA-4 alone and 10-fold over no treatment and
cryoablation plus IgG (Fig. 2C). Likewise, CD4þFoxP3 T cells
were increased in combination-treated tumors 8-fold and 4fold compared with both untreated and cryoablation plus IgGtreated tumors and anti–CTLA-4–treated tumors, respectively
(Fig. 2C). The increased T-cell inﬁltration into tumors observed
in the combination-treated mice correlated with tumor rejection and suggests that these T cell types are important for
tumor eradication.
CD8þ T cells are important for tumor rejection and
combination treatment produces an immune response
to the immunodominant CD8þ TRAMP C2 antigen
SPAS-1
Having shown the efﬁcacy of combination treatment in
mediating tumor inﬁltration by T cells, we next focused on
the speciﬁcities of these inﬁltrates. The data from Fig. 2

suggested that CD8þ T cells are important for tumor rejection because we observed a correlation between CD8þ T-cell
inﬁltration and tumor rejection. To determine the necessity
of CD8þ T cells in controlling tumor growth after combination treatment, we depleted CD8þ T cells prior to therapy
by in vivo administration of CD8-depleting antibodies. The
antibody was successful in depleting most of the CD8þ T
cells, as assessed by staining of peripheral blood leukocytes
prior to cryotherapy (Supplementary Fig. S1). A signiﬁcant
difference in survival between combination-treated mice
with and without depletion was observed, indicating that
CD8þ T cells contribute to tumor eradication in our system
(Fig. 3).
To show that these CD8þ T cells were speciﬁc for the
TRAMP tumor, we stained both tumors and spleens with
SPAS-1/MHC class I tetramers. We have previously shown
that the SPAS-1 TRAMP tumor antigen is an immunodominant
CD8þ T cell target on TRAMP cells (22). Of the CD8þ T cells

untreated, anti–CTLA-4 only, and cryoablation plus IgG-treated tumors, respectively (Fig. 4A). Interestingly, the percentage
of CD44þ SPAS-1–speciﬁc CD8þ T cells increased to 80.6% in
combination therapy–treated tumors (Fig. 4A). This increase
in percentage translated to a 58-fold increase in total SPAS-1–
speciﬁc T cells per mg of tumor over no treatment and
cryoablation plus IgG and a 2.5-fold increase over anti–
CTLA-4 monotherapy treatment, indicating that tumors from
treated mice are highly inﬁltrated by activated tumor-speciﬁc
CD8þ T cells (Fig. 4B). Finally, we determined the frequency of
SPAS-1–speciﬁc T cells in the spleen. We found that CD44þ
SPAS-1–speciﬁc CD8þ T cells were signiﬁcantly increased in
the spleens of combination-treated mice compared with controls, suggesting that the combination treatment induced
systemic expansion of tumor-speciﬁc CD8þ T cells (Fig. 5A

CTLA-4 Blockade and Cryoablation Combination Immunotherapy

T cells contributed to tumor rejection in our model (Fig. 3)
and based on our previous data, showing that SPAS-1 is the
major target in the anti-TRAMP tumor response (22), it is
likely that these SPAS-1–speciﬁc T cells are playing a major
role in the immune response induced by combination
therapy.

Cryoablation/CTLA-4 blockade combination therapy
increases the intratumoral effector to Treg ratio
CD4þFoxP3þ Tregs have been shown to play a role in
dampening the immune response against tumors (24).
Several studies from our laboratory using the B16 melanoma tumor model reported that the efﬁciency of different
immunotherapeutic regimens in combination with CTLA-4
blockade (GVAX, Treg depletion, adoptive cell therapy, and
FLT3 ligand expressing vaccine) directly correlates with a
shift in the intratumoral balance from Tregs to Teffs (25–
28). To assess the role of Tregs in cryoablation/anti–CTLA-4
therapy, we evaluated secondary tumors 15 days after
cryoablation for the presence of CD4þFoxP3þ Tregs by ﬂow
cytometry. Twenty-nine to 44% of the CD4þ T cells inside
untreated, anti–CTLA-4 and cryoablation plus IgG-treated
tumors were FoxP3þ (Fig. 6A). In contrast, a much lower
6.22% of the intratumoral CD4þ T cells from the combination-treated tumors stained for FoxP3, indicating that a
relatively suppressive environment exists within progressively growing TRAMP C2 tumors (Fig. 6A). This decrease in
percentage of Tregs was not due to fewer Tregs inﬁltrating
the combination-treated tumors, as the total number of
CD4þFoxP3þ Tregs per mg of tumor was similar among the
4 groups (Fig. 6B). Rather, the decrease was due to the
elevated expansion or inﬁltration of CD4þFoxP3 T cells,

treatment and cryoablation/anti–CTLA-4 combination-treated mice with
and without depletion of CD8þ T cells. Data were pooled from 3
independent experiments. The log-rank test was used for statistical
analysis.

To determine whether the SPAS-1–speciﬁc T cells
detected by tetramer staining were capable of exerting
effector function, we carried out ELISPOT assays for IFNg
secretion. Splenocytes were incubated with SPAS-1 peptide
(SNC9H8) for 20 hours to induce IFNg secretion by SPAS-1–
reactive cells. Consistent with the increased numbers of
tetramer-positive cells observed in spleens, we detected a
signiﬁcant increase in IFNg-positive cells in spleens from
cryoablation/anti–CTLA-4–treated mice compared with
controls (Fig. 5C). Taken together, these data indicated that
cryoablation and CTLA-4 blockade synergize to induce an
antigen-speciﬁc CD8þ inﬁltrate capable of producing an
effector response within a secondary tumor. Because CD8þ

which are likely to be CD4þ effector cells in treated tumors.
This result is consistent with the relative increase in the
CD4þ Teff to Treg ratio compared with control tumors (Fig.
6C). In addition, an increase in the intratumoral CD8þ T cell
to Treg ratio was observed in the tumor reﬂecting the
increased numbers of CD8þ T cells observed in the treated
tumors depicted in Fig. 2C (Fig. 6C). Thus, consistent with
results obtained previously in our laboratory in the GVAX/
anti–CTLA-4 B16 system (27), cryoablation and CTLA-4
blockade therapy dramatically shifts the intratumoral balance, increasing the ratio of Teff to Tregs, and this shift
correlates with tumor immunity.

Discussion
We have shown here that cryoablation and anti–CTLA-4
combination therapy produces systemic immunity and tumor
rejection in the TRAMP C2 mouse prostate model. Our model
system involved the cryoablation of a large primary tumor
followed one day later by anti–CTLA-4 administration and a
secondary tumor challenge on the opposite ﬂank. We injected
the second tumor the day following cryoablation to model the
outgrowth of micrometastases that become established after
cryoablation and lead to recurrent disease. A study in the B16
model showed that proteins are released from the tumor into
the draining lymph nodes and presented on dendritic cells
(DC) up to 3 days following cryoablation (18). Thus, the
injection of a second tumor one day after cryoablation in our
model represents a nascent micrometastasis that develops
during this antigen release.
We tracked the antigen-speciﬁc CD8þ T-cell response to
TRAMP C2 cells using tetramer and ELISPOT assays to detect

the recently identiﬁed, immunodominant TRAMP C2 antigen
SPAS-1 (22). We report that, after combination therapy, SPAS1–reactive T cells made up more than 80% of the intratumoral
CD8þ T cells and increased in absolute numbers in these
treated mice, showing the ability of the therapy to enhance
the tumor-speciﬁc CD8 response. The combination therapy
also resulted in an enhanced frequency of SPAS-1–reactive
CD8þ T cells in the spleen, which is evidence of a systemic
response with the potential to eradicate disseminated disease.
Depleting CD8þ T cells diminished the therapeutic effect and
because most of the CD8þ T cells in the tumors of treated mice
were speciﬁc for SPAS-1, it is likely that SPAS-1–speciﬁc T cells
are important for tumor rejection.
TRAMP C2 cells were derived from a primary prostate
tumor of a TRAMP mouse, which develop tumors due to
prostate-speciﬁc expression of SV40 T antigen (29). The
mutation in SPAS-1 likely arose in the prostate tumor of
the mouse from which it was derived, and therefore, is only
present in the cell line making it unique to the TRAMP C2
cells. The antigenic epitope of SPAS-1 was found to be highly
immunogenic compared with its nonmutated counterpart,
and peptide-pulsed DCs conferred protection against a
TRAMP C2 tumor challenge (22). In human tumors, mutated
tumor antigens may be important targets of the immune
response generated by immunotherapies. A study by Segal
and colleagues identiﬁed mutations in breast and colorectal
tumors that resulted in neoepitopes that could bind HLAA 0201 (30). They found that breast tumors contained an
average of 10 neoepitopes whereas colorectal tumors had an
average of 7 neoepitopes. The extent by which these neoantigens elicit immune responses is currently unknown, but
because of their proposed higher immunogenicity relative to

nonmutated shared antigens, they are likely to play an
important role in immunity to tumors and thus represent
potential targets in therapies such as cryoablation that
increase antigen presentation. Because patient tumors are
likely to contain immunogenic, mutated self-antigens as a
result of genomic instability (30), we believe that following
the SPAS-1 response is a suitable readout of the immune
response to a unique tumor antigen, the type likely to be
targeted in patients undergoing this combination therapy.
Furthermore, in preclinical studies of novel immunotherapies using the transplantable TRAMP tumor model, the

www.aacrjournals.org

tetramer assays for SPAS-1 described for the ﬁrst time herein
will likely be useful tools to show a favorable immunologic
response.
We addressed the cellular mechanisms mediating tumor
rejection in our system by assessing both the effector and Treg
responses. We showed that both CD8þ and CD4þFoxP3
T cells are increased in tumors as a result of cryoablation/
anti–CTLA-4 combination therapy. Importantly, the intratumor ratio of Teff to Treg was also increased as a result of our
treatment, which has been correlated with tumor rejection in
the B16 GVAX/anti–CTLA-4 model (27). This has also been
observed in clinical studies of ovarian cancer, in which a high
Teff to Treg ratio in tumors was prognostic of improved
survival (31) and associated with increased tumor necrosis in
patients treated with anti–CTLA-4 (32). These studies further
support the use of this ratio as a marker of a favorable
immunologic response to immunotherapy. Moreover, tumor
immunity was enhanced when Treg depletion, through antiCD25–depleting antibodies or cyclophosphamide treatment
was combined with cryoablation (8, 33), indicating that Tregs
are important modulators of tumor immunity in response to
cryoablation.
Since the regression of metastases after cryoablation was
ﬁrst observed in patients, investigators have examined the
immune response in animal models in hopes of showing a
"cryoimmunologic" effect. The results of these studies are
mixed, preventing a consensus with regard to the effect of
cryoablation as a monotherapy to treat metastatic disease.
Numerous studies report immunologic beneﬁt resulting in
the rejection of secondary tumor challenges following cryoablation (34–37). However, others have reported no effect (38)
or an enhancement of secondary tumor growth after cryoablation (39–41). The results of our cryoablation study indicate that in our system, cryoablation alone had no effect on
secondary tumor growth or T-cell inﬁltration into secondary
tumors. Despite the lack of a response from cryoablation
alone, we observed a synergistic effect when cryoablation
was combined with anti–CTLA-4. Although the immune
response to cryoablation alone may vary with each patient,
combination with CTLA-4 blockade has the potential to
create a robust antitumor immune response that controls
the growth of metastases and prevents the recurrence of
disease. This work has led to the generation of proposals for
clinical trials in which cryoablation will be combined with
CTLA-4 blockade to treat cancer.
