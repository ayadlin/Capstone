Abstract
Erlotinib (Tarceva), an epidermal growth factor receptor
(EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitor, has clinical activity in
advanced lung cancer, but disease that initially responds to
erlotinib eventually progresses. The mechanism of this
acquired resistance is unclear. We established two erlotinibresistant pools of A-431 cells, a well-characterized epidermoid
cancer cell line that constitutively overexpresses EGFR and is
sensitive to erlotinib, by continuous exposure to erlotinib over
a 6-month period. The extent of EGFR gene amplification or
mutation of the EGFR tyrosine kinase domain was not altered
in the resistant cells. Intracellular erlotinib concentrations,
determined by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry, were almost the same in all three cell lines.
Immunoprecipitation with EGFR antibody followed by detection with phosphotyrosine antibody revealed that erlotinib
effectively reduced EGFR phosphorylation in both parental
cells and resistant cells. Erlotinib induced mutated in multiple
advanced cancers 1/phosphatase and tensin homologue
(MMAC1/PTEN) and suppressed phosphorylated Akt (Ser473)
but not in the erlotinib-resistant cells. Overexpression of
MMAC1/PTEN by transfection with Ad.MMAC1/PTEN or by
pharmacologic suppression of Akt activity restored erlotinib
sensitivity in both resistant pools. Further, transfection of
parental A-431 cells with constitutively active Akt was
sufficient to cause resistance to erlotinib. We propose that
acquired erlotinib resistance associated with MMAC1/PTEN
down-regulation and Akt activation could be overcome by
inhibitors of signaling through the phosphatidylinositol
3-kinase pathway. [Cancer Res 2007;67(12):5779–88]

Introduction
The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is overexpressed
in several types of solid tumors. EGFR protein levels correlated with
EGFR gene copy numbers. Activation of EGFR signaling in tumor
cells has been linked with increases in proliferation, angiogenesis,
and metastasis and with decreases in apoptosis and poor
prognosis, collectively making EGFR an attractive target for
anticancer therapy (1). Erlotinib (Tarceva) is a small molecule

targeting the ATP-binding site of EGFR, which results in inhibition
of tyrosine kinase activity (2). Erlotinib is the first anti-EGFR agent
to extend survival among patients with advanced non–small cell
lung cancer (2). Although EGFR overexpression or amplification
has been reported to be a predictive factor for disease response
and survival after treatment with EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors
(TKI; refs. 2–5), other reports showed that EGFR expression level
does not predict sensitivity to EGFR TKIs, such as erlotinib or
gefitinib (6–10). Thus, identification of predictors of response to
such inhibitors is a topic of active investigation. Some groups have
reported that the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathway
could be involved in erlotinib sensitivity (3–5, 11–17); others have
found that the presence of somatic mutations in the tyrosine kinase
domain of EGFR in non–small cell lung cancer, or coexpression of
EGFRvIII and mutated in multiple advanced cancers 1/phosphatase
and tensin homologue (MMAC1/PTEN) in glioblastoma, may reflect
sensitivity to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibition (18–25). Screening in
other types of sensitive tumors has not revealed similar mutations,
suggesting that other molecular characteristics exist that predict
response to EGFR inhibitors.
Another important question of clinical relevance is how disease
that initially responds to EGFR TKIs acquires resistance to these
drugs. Although the presence of somatic mutations in the tyrosine
kinase domain of EGFR in non–small cell lung cancer has been
reported to predict initial response, it did not predict prolonged
survival and some patients with EGFR mutations had progressive
disease (4, 5). Attempts to address this question have included the
study of gefitinib in the non–small cell lung cancer cell line PC-9
and the prostate cancer cell line DU-145 (23, 25–28). However, the
mechanism by which lung cancer cells escape erlotinib-mediated
growth inhibition and acquire resistance to erlotinib after longterm exposure has not been studied in vitro. To evaluate possible
mechanisms of acquired resistance of erlotinib, we chose to study
A-431 cells, an erlotinib-sensitive, EGFR-overexpressing epidermoid cancer cell line without functional mutations or deletions in
the EGFR tyrosine kinase domain. This work provides the first
demonstration that acquired resistance to erlotinib depends on
activation of phosphorylated Akt (p-Akt) after the downregulation of MMAC1/PTEN and could be overcome by using
PI3K inhibitors.

(Ad.MMAC1/PTEN) was developed by the late Dr. Peter A. Steck and kindly
provided by Ta-Jen Liu (M. D. Anderson Cancer Center, University of Texas,
Houston, TX; ref. 31). Ad.mock was used as a control vector.
Establishment of erlotinib acquired resistant cell lines. To establish
erlotinib-resistant cell lines, A-431 cells were continuously exposed to
erlotinib for 6 months. Pool 1 was created by exposing cells to 3 Amol/L
erlotinib for 1 month followed by 5 Amol/L erlotinib for another month and
finally 10 Amol/L for 4 more months; pool 2 was created by exposure to
3 Amol/L erlotinib for 1 month followed by 5 Amol/L for 5 months. Medium
was replaced twice weekly and cells were passaged at 70% confluence. The
resistant pools were maintained in medium without erlotinib for at least
1 week before each experiment.
3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay.
The 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT)
assay was done as described previously (32). These experiments were
repeated thrice.
Clonogenic assay. A-431 parental cells and erlotinib-resistant pools
were seeded at a density of 100 cells per 100-mm culture dish and incubated
overnight. Erlotinib was added to a final concentration of 5 or 10 Amol/L,
and the cells were incubated for 12 days in a humidified incubator at 37jC
with 5% CO2. Colonies were counted when they reached 50 cells by staining
with 0.1% crystal violet in 20% ethanol for 5 min at room temperature.
Numbers of colony-forming units in the treated cultures are expressed as
percentages of the untreated controls. These experiments were repeated
thrice.
Flow cytometric analysis of cell cycle distribution. A-431 cells and
erlotinib-resistant pools were plated in 60-mm dishes, cultured overnight,
and then treated or not treated with 10 Amol/L erlotinib in a humidified
incubator at 37jC with 5% CO2. After 72 h, floating and adherent cells were
collected by trypsinization, fixed overnight in 70% ethanol, and resuspended
in propidium iodide (25 Ag/mL) supplemented with 0.1% RNase A and 0.1%
Triton X-100. DNA content was measured with a FACScan flow cytometer
(BD Biosciences). These experiments were repeated thrice.
Bromodeoxyuridine incorporation assay. A-431 parental cells and the
two erlotinib-resistant pools were plated on 60-mm dishes, treated or not
treated with 10 Amol/L erlotinib for 72 h, and then incubated with
bromodeoxyuridine (BrdUrd; Sigma Chemical Co.) for 30 min at 37jC with
5% CO2. Floating and adherent cells were collected by trypsinization,
washed with PBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin, fixed overnight in
70% ethanol, stained with anti-BrdUrd-FITC (BD Biosciences) for 30 min,
and then sorted by a FACScan flow cytometer to determine the percentages
of proliferating cells. These experiments were repeated thrice.
Chromosome preparation and fluorescence in situ hybridization
with an EGFR probe. Exponentially growing cultures of A-431 parental cell
line and resistant pools were fed 24 h before being harvested for
chromosome preparation. Cytologic preparations were made according to
standard procedures. Briefly, cells were exposed to demecolcine (colcemid;
0.04 Ag/mL) for 1 h, subjected to hypotonic treatment (0.075 mol/L KCl for
20–25 min at room temperature), and fixed in a mixture of methanol and
acetic acid (3:1 by volume). Air-dried slides were made and fluorescence
in situ hybridization (FISH) was done with a locus-specific identifier EGFR
probe from Vysis, Inc. (Abbott Laboratories) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Briefly, the slides were denatured in 70% formamide/2
sodium chloride-sodium citrate buffer at 73jC for 5 min and 10 AL of the
probe, denatured at 72jC for 5 min, were applied on the slide and
hybridized overnight at 37jC. The slides were washed in 2 sodium
chloride-sodium citrate buffer/0.3% NP40 at 72jC for 2 min and counterstained with 4¶,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole. Analysis was done on a Nikon
Eclipse 800 photomicroscope equipped with a cooled charged-coupled
device camera. At least 25 metaphases were analyzed and 10 metaphases
were captured from each cell line. Gene copy numbers in each cell line were
counted by a pathologist (S.K.). These experiments were repeated twice.
Mutation analyses of EGFR tyrosine kinase domain. Genomic DNA
was extracted from each cell line by using a DNeasy kit (Qiagen), and exons
18 to 21 (the area of the EGFR gene coding for the tyrosine kinase domain)

Figure 3. A, intracellular erlotinib content was measured by LC-MS/MS. The
intracellular content values after a 24-h exposure was as follows: parental
cells, 0.71 F 0.04 ng/107 cells; pool 1, 1.01 F 0.29 ng/107 cells; and pool
2, 0.79 F 0.08 ng/107 cells. B, erlotinib reduced EGFR signaling in both the
resistant and parental cells. Immunoprecipitation (IP ) with EGFR antibody
followed by detection with a phosphotyrosine antibody showed that the extent of
EGFR autophosphorylation resulting from EGF stimulation was reduced by
erlotinib both in resistant pools (density ratios at 10 Amol/L/0 Amol/L erlotinib
were 0.307 for pool 1 and 0.478 for pool 2) as well as in the parental cells
(density ratio, 0.431). WB, Western blot.

were amplified separately. PCR and sequencing were done with a BigDye
Terminator v3.1 Cycle Sequencing kit (Applied Biosystems) and 3730XL
DNA Analyzer (Applied Biosystems) in the M. D. Anderson DNA Analysis
Core Facility. Sense and antisense sequences were obtained from the
products of the same amplification reactions. The following primer pairs
(sense and antisense) were used to generate EGFR cDNA fragments: exon
18, TTGTCCTTCCAAATGAGCTGG and TGCAAGGACTCTGGGCTCC; exon 19,
ATCACTGGGCAGCATGTGG and GGCCAGTGCTGTCTCTAAGGG; exon
20, TGCGTCTTCACCTGGAAGG and TCCCCATGGCAAACTCTTG; and exon
21, ATGACCCTGAATTCGGATGC and CCAAAGCAGCTCTGGCTCAC. All
sequences were confirmed at least twice from independent PCR isolates.
Intracellular erlotinib concentration. Intracellular erlotinib content
after a 24-h exposure was measured by liquid chromatography-tandem
mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Samples were prepared as follows: Cells
(3  106 in 30 mL) were plated on 150-mm dishes and incubated for
36 h, after which medium was changed to that containing 0 or 10 Amol/L
of erlotinib. Plates were then incubated for 24 h in a humidified
incubator at 37jC with 5% CO2. Cells were then washed twice in PBS,
trypsinized, and neutralized with fresh medium. After another centrifugation at 1,000  g for 5 min, cells were resuspended in fresh medium
and then counted. The cell pellets were then washed thrice followed by
centrifugation at 2,000  g for 2 min each time and stored at 80jC
until analysis by LC-MS/MS. The results were confirmed twice in
independent experiments.
Immunoprecipitation of EGFR. To confirm that EGF signaling was
being reduced by erlotinib, cells were plated, incubated overnight, washed
twice with serum-free medium, and then incubated in serum-free medium
for 24 h. The medium was then replaced with medium containing 0.05%
fetal bovine serum, and the cells were treated with 0 or 10 Amol/L of

Signaling Solutions) for 15 min. Cells were then washed twice with PBS,
collected by scraping, and lysed for 30 min at 4jC in lysis buffer [20 mmol/L

acid (BCA) protein assay kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions
(Pierce Biotechnology). Protein extracts (200 Ag per sample) were precleared to
reduce nonspecific adsorption to immunoprecipitates by incubating them for
1 h with 15 AL of a protein A-agarose suspension (Calbiochem). The precleared
lysates were then subjected to immunoprecipitation with 30 AL of protein
A-agarose beads bound to 2 Ag of anti-EGFR antibody Ab-13. Precipitates were
separated by electrophoresis on 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, transferred
to a polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membrane, and probed with anti-

phosphotyrosine antibody 4G10 (Upstate Cell Signaling Solutions). The results
were confirmed twice in independent experiments.
Western blotting. Cells were washed twice with PBS, trypsinized,
and washed twice with ice-cold PBS. Cell pellets were then lysed in a buffer

30 min on ice. Cell lysates were clarified by centrifugation for 30 min at
14,000  g , and the total protein concentration in the resultant
supernatants was determined with a BCA protein assay kit (Pierce
Biotechnology). Equal amounts (50 Ag) of protein were heated in SDS
sample buffer with DTT ( final concentration, 10 mmol/L) at 98jC,
fractionated by size on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, and transferred onto

Results
Establishment of cell lines with acquired erlotinib-resistant
cell lines. To elucidate the mechanism of acquired resistance
against erlotinib, we established erlotinib-resistant A-431 cell lines
through continuous exposure to this drug for 6 months.
Morphologically, the two pools were similar to the parental cells.
We first confirmed resistance to erlotinib in the pools by MTT
assay; IC50 values were calculated from the percentage of viable
cells after exposure to erlotinib at various concentrations
(Fig. 1A). The IC50 value for the parental cells was 1.67 Amol/L
compared with 17.6 Amol/L for resistant pool 1 and 13.2 Amol/L
for resistant pool 2. Erlotinib resistance was also confirmed
by clonogenic assay (Fig. 1B). Under continuous exposure to
5 Amol/L erlotinib, parental cells formed very few colonies,
whereas resistant pools formed colonies after exposure to
erlotinib concentrations as high as 10 Amol/L (pool 1, 91.7 F
13.0% of untreated control; pool 2, 74.7 F 3.46% of untreated
control). Cell cycle distribution studies also showed that 72 h of
erlotinib exposure increased the proportion of parental cells in subG1 (0.09% at 0 Amol/L, 26.6% at 10 Amol/L) and G1 arrest (39.5% at
0 Amol/L, 81.1% at 10 Amol/L) and reduced the proportion of
parental cells in S phase (60.5% at 0 Amol/L, 16.0% at 10 Amol/L). In
contrast, 72 h of erlotinib exposure had no effect on cell cycle
distribution in the resistant pools (Fig. 1C). Notably, the S-phase
fractions remained high after exposure to 10 Amol/L erlotinib in
both resistant pools (57.1% in pool 1 and 54.6% in pool 2). DNA
synthesis rates, assessed by BrdUrd staining, were substantially
reduced from 38.5% to 4.84% in parental cells exposed to erlotinib
but were unchanged in the resistant pools (Fig. 1D). Treatment with
10 Amol/L erlotinib increased the amount of cleaved 85-kDa PARP
in parental cells but not in the resistant pools, indicating that apoptosis had been induced only in the parental cells (data not shown).
Extent of EGFR gene amplification is not involved in
erlotinib acquired resistance. To clarify the possible molecular
mechanisms underlying resistance of the A-431 pools to erlotinib,
we examined the amount of EGFR gene amplification by FISH. All
three cell lines showed high levels of amplification, with more than
20 gene copies (Fig. 2A). This result suggests that EGFR gene
amplification was not involved in the acquired resistance of our
A-431–resistant pools.
Mutation of the EGFR tyrosine kinase domain is not
involved in erlotinib acquired resistance. We next examined
the sequence of exons 18 to 21 of EGFR (the area of the gene that
codes for the tyrosine kinase domain). We identified a silent
mutation at exon 20 in both the parental cells and the resistant
pools (Fig. 2B), but we found no differences between the parental
cells and the resistant pools. This result confirmed that mutation of
the EGFR tyrosine kinase domain was not involved in the acquired
resistance of our A-431–resistant pools.
Erlotinib crossed the cell membranes in the resistant cells
and reduced EGFR phosphorylation. Subsequently, we investi-

www.aacrjournals.org

gated whether the cellular uptake of erlotinib was altered in
resistant versus parental cells. Intracellular erlotinib content was
measured by LC-MS/MS after a 24-h drug exposure as follows:
parental cells, 0.71 F 0.04 ng/107 cells; pool 1, 1.01 F 0.29 ng/107
cells; and pool 2, 0.79 F 0.08 ng/107 cells (Fig. 3A). Thus, intracellular drug uptake and retention were similar in the parental and
resistant cells, suggesting that the differential sensitivity to erlotinib
observed was not related to differences in cellular drug uptake.
To establish whether erlotinib-mediated inhibition of EGFR was
altered in the resistant cells, we examined EGFR phosphorylation
after stimulation with EGF with or without erlotinib (Fig. 3B).
Immunoprecipitation with EGFR antibody followed by detection
with a phosphotyrosine antibody showed that the extent of EGFR
autophosphorylation resulting from EGF stimulation was reduced
by erlotinib both in resistant pools (density ratios at 10 Amol/L/
0 Amol/L erlotinib were 0.307 for pool 1 and 0.478 for pool 2) as
well as in the parental cells (density ratio, 0.431). We concluded
from these results that erlotinib effectively reduced EGFR kinase
activity in both the resistant and parental cells.
Basal MMAC1/PTEN protein expression was down-regulated
in both resistant pools. Next, we examined molecules reported to
be involved in sensitivity to EGFR TKIs by Western blotting.
Expression of EGFR, HER2, Akt, ERK1/ERK2, p-ERK1/ERK2, p27,
STAT3, p-STAT3 (Tyr705), and p-STAT3 (Ser727) levels was similar in
the parental cells and the resistant pools (Fig. 4A). Expression of
HER3, p-HER3, IGF-IR, p-IGF-IR, and E-cadherin proteins was
down-regulated in both resistant pools relative to that in the
parental cells, with particularly marked decreases in HER3, p-HER3,
IGF-IR, and p-IGF-IR (Fig. 4A). HER4 was not detected in any of the
three cell lines, and expression of the PI3K subunit p85a and that of
p-PI3K was no different in the parental cells than in the resistant
cells. Notably, expression of MMAC1/PTEN was down-regulated in
resistant pools (density ratios versus parental cell expression were
0.338 for pool 1 and 0.473 for pool 2). Further, expression of p-Akt
(Ser473) was modestly up-regulated in resistant cells (density ratios
versus parental cell expression were 2.06 for pool 1 and 1.30 for
pool 2).
Erlotinib suppressed p-Akt (Ser473) in parental cells but not
in the resistant cells. At this point, we chose to focus on p-Akt
because it was the only molecule that was up-regulated in both
erlotinib-resistant pools and was a potential candidate for
involvement in the mechanism of acquired resistance. The protein
expression levels of some molecules in the EGFR-Akt signaling
pathway were evaluated after erlotinib treatment by Western
blotting (Fig. 4B). Notably, p-Akt (Ser473) was completely suppressed in parental cells treated with 10 Amol/L erlotinib but not in
the resistant pools. In addition, MMAC1/PTEN expression was
increased in parental cells treated with 10 Amol/L erlotinib but not
in the resistant pools. Expression of other molecules was not
affected by erlotinib treatment in the parental or the resistant cells.
Treatment with Akt inhibitor IV blocked the expression of
p-Akt (Ser473) and restored erlotinib sensitivity in both
resistant pools. To determine whether Akt activity is critical for
erlotinib sensitivity, we treated parental and resistant A-431 cells
with the Akt-specific inhibitor IV and erlotinib. The Akt inhibitor IV
(100 nmol/L) effectively blocked the expression of p-Akt (Ser473;
Fig. 5A) and restored erlotinib sensitivity in both resistant pools
(Fig. 5A).
Transfection with MMAC1/PTEN blocked the expression of
p-Akt (Ser473) and restored erlotinib sensitivity in both
resistant pools. We then transfected the erlotinib-resistant pools

with Ad.MMAC1/PTEN to assess the role of MMAC1/PTEN in
acquired resistance. Overexpression of MMAC1/PTEN in these cells
led to down-regulation of p-Akt (Fig. 5B) and restored erlotinib
sensitivity in both resistant pools (Fig. 5B).
Transfection of active Akt in A-431 parental cells caused
resistant to erlotinib. To investigate whether p-Akt activation
could cause resistant to erlotinib in erlotinib-sensitive cells, we
transfected A-431 parental cells with Ad.CA-Akt or Ad.mock,
treated them with 5 or 10 Amol/L of erlotinib, and tested cell
viability by MTT assay. Transfection with Ad.CA-Akt caused
activation of p-Akt (Ser473) and resistance to erlotinib (Fig. 5C).
Transfection with Ad.CA-Akt also resulted in decreases in the
percentage of apoptotic cells (the sub-G1 peak; Fig. 5C).
Expression of p-Akt (Ser473) protein in intrinsically erlotinib-resistant breast cancer cell lines was not down-regulated
by erlotinib. Finally, to examine the mechanistic difference
between acquired and intrinsic resistance to erlotinib, we
examined p-Akt (Ser473) expression level in two intrinsically
erlotinib-resistant breast cancer cell lines that also overexpress
EGFR-MDA-MB-468 and BT-549 cells. The IC50 value of erlotinib for
A-431 cells was 1.67 Amol/L; by comparison, the IC50 values for
MDA-MB-468 and BT-549 cells were >20 Amol/L (data not shown).
Treatment with 10 Amol/L erlotinib did not down-regulate p-Akt
(Ser473) expression in MDA-MB-468 and BT-549 cells (Fig. 5D).
Finally, the combination of 10 Amol/L erlotinib plus the Akt
inhibitor IV partially increased sensitivity to erlotinib in both the
MDA-MB-468 and BT-549 cells (Fig. 5D).

Discussion
Our results show that acquired resistance to erlotinib can be
caused by down-regulation of MMAC1/PTEN and subsequent
activation of p-Akt. We further found that the acquired resistance
could be overcome by overexpression of MMAC1/PTEN or inhibition of Akt activity. The findings of MMAC1/PTEN down-regulation
in erlotinib-resistant cells and the inability of erlotinib to induce
MMAC1/PTEN expression are novel and have not been reported
previously as possible mechanisms for acquired resistance to EGFR
TKIs. Unlike previous studies, we used A-431 epidermoid cancer
cells, which do not have mutations in EGFR and were used in the
development of the EGFR TKIs erlotinib and gefitinib.
A previous study of gefitinib-resistant PC-9 lung adenocarcinoma cells with an EGFR mutation suggested that changes in
adaptor protein-mediated signal transduction from EGFR to Akt
may represent a possible mechanism by which cells become
resistant to gefitinib (26). The same group showed in a subsequent
study that, after long-term exposure to gefitinib, PC-9 cells stop
overexpressing EGFR and acquire gefitinib resistance (27). Others
have reported that persistent activity of signaling pathways from
EGFR to p-Akt was associated with sensitivity to EGFR TKIs (4),
and p-Akt activation, especially EGFR-independent p-Akt activation, has been recognized as an intrinsic resistance factor to EGFR
TKIs (11, 12).
With regard to intrinsic resistance to EGFR TKIs, our findings
agree with those of a previous study that knockdown of MMAC1/
PTEN reduced sensitivity to erlotinib and that expression of
MMAC1/PTEN in a MMAC1/PTEN-null cell line increased
sensitivity to erlotinib (20). Dysfunction or loss of MMAC1/PTEN,
which blocks PI3K/Akt signaling, is thought to be involved in
intrinsic resistance to EGFR TKIs (11, 13, 17, 20). Indeed, the
MDA-MB-468 and BT-549 cell lines used in the present study are

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (12). June 15, 2007

known to lack MMAC1/PTEN function through deletion or
mutation of the MMAC1/PTEN gene (33). Interestingly, the extent
of MMAC1/PTEN down-regulation was nearly equivalent in both
resistant pools but p-Akt activation was more prominent in pool
1 (also the most resistant to erlotinib). These results could imply
that down-regulation of MMAC1/PTEN may represent an early step
in acquired resistance, and the subsequent up-regulation of p-Akt
by other mechanisms could increase the extent of resistance. Future
studies are necessary to determine the precise mechanisms of
MMAC1/PTEN down-regulation and p-Akt activation in this
process. In particular, MMAC1/PTEN could be regulated by a
variety of mechanisms, including deletion/mutation, phosphorylation, oxidation, subcellular localization, lipid ligands, and proteinbinding partners (34). Research is under way to clarify the
molecular mechanisms of MMAC1/PTEN down-regulation.
Our finding confirmed that the mechanisms of acquired and
intrinsic resistance have some pathways in common (e.g., p-Akt
and MMAC1/PTEN). However, the effect of the combination of the
Akt inhibitor IV plus erlotinib on cell viability was more modest in
the intrinsically resistant (breast cancer) cell lines than in the
acquired resistant A-431 cells. The specificity of Akt inhibitor IV is
unclear, but it contains planar heterocycles that may target the
ATP-binding sites of kinases (30). It inhibits phosphorylation of
Akt by targeting its immediate upstream kinase, PDK1, but it does
not directly affect p-Akt or its upstream target PI3K (30) nor does
it affect EGFR-induced ERK1/ERK2 (35). However, we found that
Akt inhibitor IV down-regulated MMAC1/PTEN in both resistant
cell lines (data not shown). Therefore, one can speculate that Akt
inhibitor IV down-regulated p-Akt independently of MMAC1/
PTEN. Hence, the modest effect of Akt inhibitor IV could be
explained by the existence of different mechanisms for intrinsic
and acquired resistance, or by the MMAC1/PTEN-null nature
of MDA-MB-468 and BT-549 cells (33), or by the possibility that
p-Akt is deregulated from the upstream molecular effect of
Akt inhibitor IV. An Akt inhibitor that directly affects Akt activity
but not that of upstream or downstream molecules (e.g., Akt inhibitor II) might be able to increase cellular sensitivity to erlotinib
(35, 36). Future studies of the PI3K/Akt pathway are necessary to
distinguish the mechanisms underlying acquired versus intrinsic
resistance.
Transfection of A-431 parental cells with Ad.CA-Akt caused high
expression of p-Akt, but the erlotinib resistant in those cells
(Fig. 5C) was modest compared with that of the resistant pools
(Fig. 1A). These results imply that acquired resistance to erlotinib
involves not only activation of p-Akt but also some other mechanisms. Our findings indicate that the resistant pools had lost the
expression of MMAC1/PTEN, HER3, IGFR, and E-cadherin,
suggesting that these molecules may be associated with loss of
sensitivity to erlotinib in A-431 cells. These results also suggest that
acquired resistance may occur by mechanisms similar to those
operating in intrinsic resistance.
EGFR is involved in many signaling pathways, including Ras/
Raf/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)/ERK kinase/MAPK,
Janus-activated kinase/STAT, protein kinase C, phospholipase Cg,
and other cytosolic pathways (13). Our investigation of STAT3 and
ERK1/ERK2 indicated that these pathways were not involved in the
acquired resistance mechanism, at least in this model. Interestingly,
erlotinib down-regulated the ERK1/ERK2 pathway in both parental
and resistant cell lines. In A-431 parental cells, p-Akt was downregulated by 12 to 24 h after erlotinib treatment followed by a
decrease in cell viability at 48 to 72 h (data not shown). However,

Erlotinib Acquired Resistance, PTEN, and p-Akt

erlotinib did not down-regulate p-Akt in the resistant pools. These
results imply that EGFR could be an attractive target if erlotinib
were combined with an agent targeting other downstream
molecules (e.g., p-Akt or MMAC1/PTEN).
Two recent studies described potential mechanisms of acquired
resistance to EGFR TKIs in lung cancer involving acquired or
selection of mutations in EGFR (23, 25). In those studies, an
additional mutation involving substitution of methionine for
threonine at position 790 within the EGFR kinase domain in
erlotinib-sensitive cells led to the development of resistance in lung
adenocarcinoma (23, 25). In contrast to our findings, those studies
showed that EGF phosphorylation was not blocked by EGFR TKIs
in cells with the acquired mutation. The previously noted PC-9 lung
cancer cell line, which has a mutation in EGFR tyrosine kinase
domain, did not acquire additional mutations in the EGFR tyrosine
kinase domain in resistant clones established either by 6 weeks of
exposure (26) or by 1 year of exposure (27). Our finding that our
resistant pools did not show mutations in the EGFR tyrosine kinase
domain agrees with these reports (26, 27).
EGFR amplification has been proposed to correlate with disease
response and/or prolonged survival after treatment with EGFR
TKIs (3–5). However, in our study, neither EGFR amplification nor
increases in EGFR expression were involved in the acquired
resistance mechanisms in A-431 cells.
The presence of efflux pumps and metabolizing enzymes in
tumors could be important in regulating the intracellular concentrations of EGFR TKIs (37, 38). Therefore, we assessed the
intracellular content of erlotinib in resistant cells to determine
whether these mechanisms were involved in the acquisition of
resistance. However, drug levels were similar in the parental and
acquired resistance cells, indicating that activation of drug efflux
pumps or drug-metabolizing systems was not involved in the
mechanism of acquired resistance to erlotinib in A-431 cells.
During our screening of various other molecules potentially
involved in the acquisition of resistance, we noted downregulation of HER3, IGFR, and E-cadherin. HER3 (ErbB3) also
activates PI3K, upstream of p-Akt, and EGF-dependent activation
of PI3K activity in A-431 cells is accompanied by the binding of
p85 to HER3 (39). Gefitinib reportedly prevents heterodimerization
of EGFR to HER2 and HER3 and blocks heregulin signaling (40).
Although overexpression of HER3 protein could modulate
sensitivity to erlotinib (41), HER3 gene gain was not a predictor
of response to EGFR TKIs in a clinical setting (42). Some evidence
exists to suggest that HER3 is overexpressed only in gefitinibsensitive cell lines and acts to couple EGFR with the PI3K/Akt
pathway in those cells (41, 43), whereas gefitinib-resistant cells do

not activate the PI3K pathway through HER3 (41). Our finding that
our resistant cells did not overexpress HER3 agrees with these
reports (41, 43).
IGF-IR activates both the Akt and ERK1/ERK2 pathways as well
as participates in cross-talk between IGF-I and the EGFR pathway
(44). This IGF signaling is subject to positive regulation by EGF,
which in turn suppresses insulin-like growth factor binding
protein-3 at the mRNA and protein levels by activating MAPK in
an EGFR tyrosine kinase–dependent manner, thereby restoring
cellular response to IGF-I (45). IGF-IR is also considered an
attractive therapy target; indeed, some reports have shown that
adding an anti-IGF-IR agent to an EGFR TKI may be more effective
than the single agent alone (46–48). However, we found both IGFIR and p-IGF-IR expression to be down-regulated in the resistant
pools. These findings stand in contrast to those describing IGF-IR
and acquired resistance to gefitinib (28).
Non–small cell lung cancer cells that express the epithelial cell
junction protein E-cadherin have shown greater sensitivity to
EGFR inhibition in vitro (49) and in vivo (50). In contrast, cells that
have undergone the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (and
thus express the mesenchymal markers vimentin or fibronectin
rather than E-cadherin) were insensitive to inhibition by erlotinib
in vitro and in xenografts (49). In our study, E-cadherin was
suppressed in both resistant pools, with the extent of the
suppression being greater in the ‘‘high-dose’’ pool 1 than in the
‘‘low-dose’’ pool 2.
In summary, down-regulation of MMAC1/PTEN and constitutively activated p-Akt seem to be critical for acquired resistance to
erlotinib in this model. We propose that erlotinib resistance is
associated with down-regulation of MMAC1/PTEN and increased
p-Akt levels and that resistant cells could be susceptible to
treatments that inhibit p-Akt activity. The precise roles of HER3,
E-cadherin, and MMAC1/PTEN in this resistance, and the clinical
relevance of these findings, require further study.
