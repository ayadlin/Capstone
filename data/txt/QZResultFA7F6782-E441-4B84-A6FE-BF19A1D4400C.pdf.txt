Among men who experience prostate-specific antigen (PSA) failure after external
beam radiation or brachytherapy (RT), many will harbor occult micrometastases;
however, a significant minority will have a true local-only failure and, thus,
potentially may benefit from a salvage local therapy. Those most likely to have a
local-only failure initially have low-risk disease (PSA <10 ng/mL, Gleason score

6, clinical T1c or T2a tumor status), pretreatment PSA velocity <2.0 ng/mL per
year at the time of initial presentation, interval to PSA failure >3 years, PSA doubling time >12 months, negative bone scan and pelvic imaging, and positive
rebiopsy. In addition, men with presalvage PSA levels >10 ng/mL, presalvage T3/
T4 disease, or presalvage Gleason scores 7 on a rebiopsy sample without significant RT effects are unlikely to be cured by salvage local therapy. Based on a
review of all series of post-RT salvage prostatectomy, cryosurgery, and brachytherapy published in English since 1990, morbidity can be substantial. Although
urinary incontinence appeared to be greater after salvage prostatectomy (41%) or
cryosurgery (36%) than after brachytherapy (6%), patients who received salvage
brachytherapy faced a 17% risk of grade 3 or 4 genitourinary complications and a
fistula risk that averaged 3.4% across all series. From this review, the authors concluded that prospective randomized studies are needed to determine the relative
efficacy of the 3 major local salvage modalities and that additional research is
needed to identify factors associated with an increased risk of significant complications to improve patient selection and to augment the benefit/risk ratio associated with attempts to cure local-only recurrences after radiation therapy.

men may experience prostate-specific antigen (PSA) failure.1–4 Many
of these men will harbor a component of micrometastatic disease at

ature on the oncologic outcome and toxicity of the
currently available treatment approaches.

Identifying Patients Who Are Most Likely to Have LocalOnly Disease
The greatest challenge in selecting a man with PSA
failure after RT for further local therapy is determining whether the rising PSA represents distant disease,
local disease, or both. Because the morbidity of a
local salvage therapy can be substantial, it is crucial
to identify which patients are most likely to have
local-only disease and, thus, have the greatest chance
of benefiting from the treatment.
Imaging
The workup for a man who is being considered for a
local salvage should include a bone scan to rule out
distant metastases and a pelvic magnetic resonance
imaging (MRI) study or computed tomography scan
to rule out regional lymph node disease. However,
because PSA failure precedes clinically evident metastases by a median of 8 years after prostatectomy
and at least 7 years after radiation, these studies are
unlikely to have a high yield.11,12 A more sensitive
test for detecting clinically occult lymph node metastases in the de novo setting is high-resolution MRI
used in conjunction with lymphotropic superparamagnetic nanoparticles, as described by Harisinghani
et al.,13 which reportedly had 90% sensitivity for
pathologic lymph node metastases compared with
the 35% sensitivity of MRI alone. This technology is
not available yet for clinical use and is undergoing
further study, but it may play a role in the work-up
of these men in the future.
Biopsy
A transrectal prostate needle biopsy should be
obtained to demonstrate local disease before local
salvage is considered. It should be reviewed by a pathologist who is familiar with radiation effects on the
prostate, because radiation changes can include the
same features that are consistent with high-grade
disease (eg, necrosis), thereby leading to an inaccurate Gleason score or a false-positive result.14 Therefore, some experts have recommended that a
Gleason pattern should be assigned in this setting
only if radiation effect is not present in the biopsy
sample.15,16 The timing of the biopsy also can affect
the test characteristics, because approximately 30%
of positive biopsies that are obtained 12 months after
radiation will convert to negative status by 24 to 30
months.17,18 Like in the de novo setting, there are
resulting sampling errors and false-negative results,

and Crook et al. have reported that 19% of patients
who have a negative posttreatment biopsy later had
a positive rebiopsy.17–19

Clinical characteristics at presentation
Men who present initially with clinical characteristics
that place them at high risk for developing distant
metastases are unlikely to have local-only disease at
the time of PSA failure. Specifically, men with an initial presenting Gleason score 8, a clinical tumor
category T2c, or a PSA level >20 ng/mL have a
shorter time to PSA failure, have a higher rate of
developing distant metastases, and have a 14-fold
increase in prostate cancer-specific mortality compared with patients who present initially with lowrisk clinical features.20–23 Ideally, candidates for salvage local therapy are those who present initially
with low-risk clinical features (PSA <10 ng/mL, biopsy Gleason score 6, T1c or T2a tumor status),
because their PSA failure is less likely to be caused
by occult micrometastases that were missed at the
time of initial therapy.
PSA kinetics at presentation
Pretreatment PSA kinetics also have emerged as important predictors of outcome after definitive therapy.
Specifically, a pretreatment PSA velocity >2.0 ng/mL
per year in the 18 months prior to diagnosis is associated with both prostate cancer-specific mortality and
all-cause mortality after radiation therapy or radical
prostatectomy (RP).24,25 In 1 RT study, men with a PSA
velocity >2.0 ng/mL per year versus <2.0 ng/mL per
year had a 24-fold greater risk of death from prostate
cancer, and this cutoff point of approximately 2.0 ng/
mL per year has been confirmed by others.26–28 Therefore, patients with a pretreatment PSA velocity >2.0 ng/
mL per year at the time of initial presentation are suboptimal candidates for local salvage therapy at the
time of PSA failure, because they are more likely to
have failed from occult micrometastases.
Interval to PSA failure
From a large series of patients who underwent RP,
Pound et al. observed that a time to PSA failure <2
years was associated with a significantly increased
risk of developing distant metastases.11 An update of
that series by Freedland et al. indicated that, with
longer follow-up, a cutoff point of 3 years was a better differentiator.29 The concept that a shorter interval to PSA failure is associated with a higher risk of
distant metastases also applies to the postradiation
setting. Zagars and Pollack reported that men who
developed metastases after RT experienced PSA failure at a median of 9 months compared with a me-

dian time to failure of 18.4 months for men who
failed but did not develop metastases.12 Those
authors suggested that a cutoff point of 1 year was
an important predictor of distant metastatic risk.
Taking the most conservative approach, the optimal
candidate for salvage local therapy should have an
interval >3 years between RT and PSA failure.

PSA doubling time
PSA doubling time (PSA-DT) at the time of PSA failure is an important predictor of the time to subsequent distant metastases. Specifically, Zagars and
Pollack observed that a PSA-DT <8 months was
associated with a 54% actuarial rate of distant metastases at 7 years compared with only 7% for men who
had a PSA-DT >8 months.12 Similarly, Zelefsky et al.
observed a 3-year actuarial rate of distant metastases
of 49% for men who had a PSA-DT <3 months compared with a rate of only 7% for men who had a
PSA-DT >12 months.30 The outcome of patients who
have a PSA-DT <3 months is particularly poor, and
work by D’Amico et al. and Freedland et al. have
demonstrated a very strong association between a
PSA-DT <3 months and prostate cancer-specific
mortality, with a median interval of 6 years between
PSA failure and death.29,31,32 Therefore, the optimal

candidate for salvage local therapy should have a
PSA-DT >8 months and, ideally, >12 months.

PSA level at the time of salvage therapy
Several studies of salvage cryotherapy have indicated
consistently that a PSA level >10 ng/mL at the time
of salvage is associated with a worse outcome. For
example, for patients who have a presalvage PSA
level <10 ng/mL versus 10 ng/mL, Izawa et al.
reported a 5-year disease-free survival (DFS) of 57%
versus 23% (P 5 .004), and de la Taille et al. reported
a 9-month PSA failure-free survival rate of 86% versus 42% (P <.001), respectively.8,33 In salvage prostatectomy series, a PSA level 10 ng/mL has been
associated with a worse pathologic stage and a significantly higher rate of subsequent PSA failure,
which makes patients who have PSA levels 10 ng/
mL suboptimal candidates for salvage local therapy.34,35
Salvage RP
RP is the local salvage modality with the longest history, and current series have included patients who
were treated in the 1960s. In Table 1, we list the
oncologic outcomes from all series of salvage RP that
have been published in the English literature since

1420

CANCER

October 1, 2007 / Volume 110 / Number 7

1990.5,10,36–47 We only included the most updated series of any given cohort of patients from a particular
institution.

Oncologic outcomes
The 5-year biochemical DFS (bDFS) rate typically
ranges from 50% to 60% in most salvage RP series.
The largest series is from the Mayo Clinic, which
dates back to 1967 and contained 199 patients,
including 138 men who underwent RP.10 At the time
of salvage RP, PSA levels were <10 ng/mL in 78% of
these patients, and pathologic (p)T2 disease was
identified in 39%. After a median follow-up of
92 months, the 5-year estimate of bDFS was 63% when
PSA failure was defined as a PSA level >0.4 ng/mL.10
The next largest series is from Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC)/Baylor Medical Center and included 100 patients who were followed for
a median of 60 months. Fifty-nine percent of those
patients had a PSA level <10 ng/mL, 35% had pT2
disease, and 55% were PSA failure-free at 5 years
when PSA failure was defined as a PSA level >0.2 ng/
mL.5 In both of these series, men who had PSA
levels <10 ng/mL at the time of salvage RP had significantly lower estimates of PSA failure compared
with men who had PSA levels 10 ng/mL.5,10
Additional analysis of factors that were predictive
of outcome was performed by Cheng et al. on a subset of 86 patients from the Mayo Clinic series.48
Those authors observed that a preoperative PSA
level <10 ng/mL (P 5 .02), a prostatectomy Gleason
score of 7 or of 8 to 10 with <7 as the baseline
(P 5 .0005), and DNA aneuploidy or tetraploidy with
diploid as the baseline (P 5 .02) each was associated
with cancer-specific survival; although, on multivariable analysis, only the associations for Gleason score
and DNA ploidy were significant.
Value of cystoprostatectomy
Oncologic outcome was worse for patients who
underwent cystoprostatectomy (CP) compared with
patients who underwent RP, with a 5-year bDFS rate
of 19% versus 63%, respectively, in the Mayo Clinic
series and 30% versus 50%, respectively, in the
Wayne State series.10,39 Because CP typically was reserved for men with bulkier or locally advanced disease, including bladder neck invasion, these results
most likely reflect differences in patient selection
rather than differences in the efficacy of the procedure. However, these poor results suggest that the
chance of curing a man who has a locally advanced
recurrence with a local salvage therapy is very low
and calls into question the utility of salvage CP as
monotherapy given its substantial morbidity.

Use of neoadjuvant androgen deprivation
In the de novo setting, 3 randomized trials have
demonstrated that short-course neoadjuvant androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT) decreases the rate of
positive surgical margins, but this has not translated
into improved biochemical outcomes.49–51 In the salvage setting, there are no randomized studies, and
retrospective data from the Mayo Clinic and the
Netherlands Cancer Institute series showed no
reduction in the positive margin rate or improvement
in outcome with neoadjuvant ADT, although it is
possible that the selection of men with more
advanced disease to receive ADT obscured any
potential benefit.10,47 Conversely, some indirect evidence in favor of neoadjuvant ADT comes from the
Gainesville series, in which the 24 men who received
neoadjuvant ADT had a 21% positive margin rate,
which compares favorably to the 33% rate in the
Mayo Clinic series and the 35% rate in the University
of Southern California series.10,38,43 In addition, those
24 men had an 80% 5-year bDFS rate, which is the
highest reported in the salvage RP literature.5,38 However, caution must be used when making comparisons across series in which the data are
retrospective, because imbalances in both known
and unknown prognostic factors may exist. Therefore, in the absence of randomized data or consistent
results from retrospective series, we cannot recommend the routine use of neoadjuvant ADT prior to
salvage RP.
Morbidity of salvage prostatectomy
The potential for cure with salvage RP must be
balanced against the risks of substantial potential
toxicities. These risks are greater in the salvage RP
setting than in the de novo setting because of radiation changes in the operative field that may cause fibrosis, merging of tissue planes used for dissection,
and poorer wound healing.52 The major toxicities of
salvage RP series published in English since 1990 are
summarized in Table 2.5,10,36–47
Perioperative mortality is very low, with only a
single treatment-related death reported from the
combined series of 531 men. Urinary incontinence
has ranged from 0% to 67% in various series, with a
weighted average across all series of 41% for patients
who underwent RP. Bladder neck stricture generally
is reported in approximately 20% to 30% of patients
(weighted average, 24%) and often leads to dysuria,
moderate pelvic pain, and the subsequent need for
dilation. The average rate of rectal injury was 4.7%
across all series.
In the MSKCC/Baylor series, complication rates
appeared to be improving over time, suggesting that

there is a learning curve for this procedure.80 Specifically, men who were treated from 1984 to 1992 had a
15% rectal injury rate compared with 2% for men
who were treated after 1992 (P 5 .01). The overall
rate of grade 2 through grade 4 complications was
reduced from 33% to 13% (P 5 .02) before versus after 1993, respectively. However, neither the rates of
incontinence (43% vs 32%, respectively) nor the rates
of anastomotic strictures (28% vs 32%, respectively)
changed before versus after 1993.

Salvage Cryotherapy
Although it was attempted first and abandoned in
the 1960s, prostate cryosurgery came to be adopted
increasingly in the early 1990s with the introduction
of a transrectal ultrasound-guided technique described by Onik et al. that allowed for improved visualization and monitoring of freezing.53 Moreover, the
introduction of urethral warming catheters has
decreased the risk of urethral sloughing and
injury.54,55 Consequently, by the late 1990s, salvage
cryotherapy had emerged as an alternative to salvage
prostatectomy. In Table 3, we list the oncologic
results from all salvage cryosurgery series that have
been published in English since 1990.6,8,56–61

Oncologic outcomes
It is apparent from the data in Table 3 that it is difficult to derive a single number for PSA control after
salvage cryosurgery, because the series used varying
definitions of PSA failure and had varied lengths of
median follow-up. The most extensively studied
cohort is the University of Texas M. D. Anderson
Cancer Center (MD Anderson) series, in which 131
men who were treated from 1992 to 1995 had a 57month median follow-up and experienced a 5-year
PSA failure-free survival rate of 40% with failure
defined as a PSA level that exceeded the nadir value
by 2 ng/mL.8 The next largest series was from Western Ontario and reported on 125 men who had a
crude PSA failure free-survival rate of 34% after a
median follow-up of 19 months, although failure
most likely was detected earlier than in the MD
Anderson series, because any PSA level >0.5 ng/mL
was scored as a failure.6 In both series, the factors
associated with a significant decrease in PSA control
were a PSA level >10 ng/mL before cryosurgery, clinical category T3 or T4 disease (prior to cryosurgery
in the Ontario series and prior to RT in the MD
Anderson series), and Gleason score (> 8 before RT
in the Ontario series and 8 before cryosurgery in

the MD Anderson series).6,8 In addition, a reanalysis
of the MD Anderson series has suggested that a PSA
DT <16 months before cryosurgery also was associated with a worse PSA outcome.62
It appears that, in general, the PSA failure-free
survival rate for cryosurgery is somewhat lower than
the 50% to 60% 5-year control rate reported in the
RP series; however, because of uncertainties regarding potential imbalances in prognostic factors among
the patients in the cohorts, no conclusions concerning the relative oncologic control can be drawn.
However, a potential explanation for the apparently
lower PSA control rates with cryosurgery compared
with RP is the possibility of incomplete ablation of
the prostate gland, as evidenced by the 50% prevalence of viable glands at 24 months in the Western
Ontario series and 59% prevalence of residual normal
or atypical glands or cancer seen in the MD Anderson series.63 Izawa et al. reported that an increased
number of freeze-thaw cycles (P 5 .002) and a
greater number of probes (P 5 .04) were associated
with improved glandular ablation, although more
aggressive ablation also has been associated with
increased morbidity, as described below.6,56–61,64–67

Morbidity of salvage cryosurgery
Table 4 lists the complication rates of all salvage
cryosurgery series published in the English literature
since 1990. Similar to the salvage RP series, perioperative mortality is extremely low, and only 1 death
(0.2%) has been reported in 510 total patients from
9 series. Also like the RP series, it has been demonstrated that morbidity for salvage cryotherapy is
more severe than when cryotherapy is performed on
a nonirradiated prostate gland.6,66

Urinary incontinence was reported in 72% of
patients in the MD Anderson series compared with
only 20% of patients in the Ontario series; however,
follow-up was shorter (19 months) in the latter series, and late complications may increase with
time.6,66,67 In addition, the MD Anderson results are
patient-reported, which may be more sensitive than
physician assessments, and used a strict definition
of incontinence, which included any urinary dribbling, even if a man did not require any pads.6
Incontinence was reported in as few as 4.3% of
patients and in as many as 96% of patients in various series, with a weighted average of 36% for all
series. Data from the Ontario series suggests that
men with a prior transurethral resection of the prostate in addition to radiation are at particularly high
risk of developing incontinence after salvage cryosurgery.66 Perotte et al. implicated the lack of a urethral warming catheter as another important risk
factor for incontinence.66
Urethral sloughing was observed in up to 27% of
patients and averaged 11% across all series. In 1 series, the incidence of sloughing was significantly
worse for patients who were treated without versus
with a urethral warming catheter (24% vs 4%, respectively; P < .003).66
Bladder neck stricture or retention occurred in
17% of patients across all series, and perineal pain
occurred in 36%. It is noteworthy that perineal pain
occurred in 44% of patients in the MD Anderson series and was so severe that it interfered with normal
daily activities in 38%. It also is important to note
that the presence of pain was associated with the
lack of a warming catheter (70% vs 34%, respectively;
P < .05).66

Although the development of fistulas was
reported in up to 11% of patients in 1 series,65 it was
an uncommon event and occurred at a rate of 2.6%
over all series. Chin et al. observed that all 4 of the
patients who developed rectal fistulas in their series
had either T3b or T4a disease and suggested that
patients with T3/T4 disease are particularly poor
candidates for salvage cryosurgery, because they are
unlikely to be cured, and they appear.6
Follow-up from the MD Anderson series indicated that 33% of patients were satisfied overall with
their cryosurgery, and that overall satisfaction was
lower for those with perineal pain and higher for
those with controlled disease.66 The authors of that
study concluded that, even with the use of a urethral
warming catheter, the frequency of morbid events is
high, and salvage cryosurgery does not appear to
have any advantages over salvage prostatectomy in
terms of morbidity or quality of life.

Salvage Brachytherapy
Prostate brachytherapy was described first by Pasteau
et al. in 1911; although, until recently, it was considered a relatively untested salvage modality compared
with the more robust experiences with salvage RP
and cryosurgery.68 However, since 2003, 5 series that
included 124 patients have been reported, nearly
doubling the total number of patients reported since

1990 to 251.69–73 In Table 5, we list the PSA outcomes
of all salvage brachytherapy series that have been
published in English since 1990.7,69–77

Oncologic outcomes
Like in the salvage cryotherapy series, the overall
PSA outcome with salvage brachytherapy is difficult
to determine both because of varying definitions of
PSA failure and because of the different lengths of
median follow-up. The largest series from Grado
et al. included 49 patients with a median follow-up
of 64 months and reported a relatively low 5-year
failure-free survival rate of 34% using 2 rises above
the nadir as the definition of failure.7 The Arizona
Oncology series (n 5 17 patients) published by Beyer
and the Mount Sinai series (n 5 30 patients) published by Lo et al. also had mature follow-up at 62
months and 59 months, respectively, and reported 5year PSA control rates (American Society for
Therapeutic Radiology and Oncology [ASTRO] 1997
consensus definition) of 53% and 57%, respectively.71,74,78 Early PSA results from Lee et al. at the
University of California-San Francisco (UCSF) have
been encouraging: Those authors reported an 89%
PSA control rate at 2 years using high-dose-rate
brachytherapy.70 In addition, early data from the
Uro-Radiology Prostate Institute indicated an 87%
crude PSA control rate at 30 months.69 These

* Failure was backdated to the date of the first rising PSA after nadir.
y
According to the 1997 ASTRO consensus definition, failure required 3 consecutive rises after a nadir. Failure was backdated to the midpoint between the nadir and the first PSA rise.
{
Crude indicates that survival was calculated as the total number of nonevents over the total number of patients without regard to time.
§
According to the 2006 Phoenix Consensus Conference definition, failure was scored on the date that the PSA level exceeded the nadir value by >2.0 ng/mL. No backdating was used.

encouraging early results potentially may be related
to the significant number of men with PSA levels <10
ng/mL at salvage (100% and 97%, respectively). However, both series also used the ASTRO 1997 consensus
definition in which failure is not determined until
there have been 3 rises above the nadir; then, failure
is backdated to the midpoint between the nadir and
the first rise.78 This can create an artifact of a time lag
in detecting failures and has the effect of underestimating failure when follow-up is short.79 Consequently, given the relatively short follow-up in those
series (19 months and 30 months, respectively), PSA
control may have been overestimated, and further
follow-up will be needed to determine whether these
early results are maintained. In the Dana Farber series, which used a nadir 12 ng/mL definition for failure that was not backdated, the 4-year PSA control
rate was 70%, which was similar to the 75% rate
reported at the Mayo Clinic by Wong et al. using the
ASTRO 1997 definition of failure but with a 44-month
median follow-up.72,73
None of the published series reported any presalvage factors that had a statistically significant association with PSA outcome, although all 4 failures in
the Uro-Radiology Prostate Institute series had both
a presalvage PSA level >10 ng/mL and presalvage
Gleason scores 7.69 Similarly, investigators in the
Arizona Oncology series reported that the 5-year PSA
failure-free survival rate was worse numerically for

patients with presalvage PSA levels 10 ng/mL
versus <10 ng/mL (25% vs 67%, respectively; P 5 .12)
and for patients with presalvage Gleason scores 7
versus 6 (30% vs 83%, respectively; P 5 .15).74
Overall, the rate PSA control achieved with salvage brachytherapy appears to be comparable to
what has been reported for salvage RP and somewhat
better than what has been reported for salvage cryosurgery. However, as discussed above, it is not possible to make definitive statements regarding relative
efficacy without a prospective randomized trial
because of the different definitions of PSA failure,
the unknown impact of patient selection, the associated known and unknown prognostic factors on
PSA outcome.

Morbidity of salvage brachytherapy
The incidence of morbidity and the complications in
salvage brachytherapy series published in English
since 1990 are listed in Table 6. No perioperative
mortality has been reported in any of the series.
Although it was not studied formally, based on first
principles and clinical common sense, reirradiating a
patient who already has ongoing RT proctopathy or
cystitis from the prior RT would be contraindicated
because of the very high risk of rectal or bladder
injury.
Incontinence was reported by from 0% to 31% of
men, with a prevalence of 6% among all men in the

combined series. Grade 3 or 4 GI toxicity ranged
from 0% to 24% and was reported in 5.6% of all men
in the combined series. Grade 3 or 4 GU toxicity was
reported in 0% to 47% of patients, with an overall
rate in the combined series of 17%. The most serious
complications were prostatic-rectal fistulas, which
accounted for the majority of complications that
required surgical intervention. Specifically, the rate
for developing of a fistula ranged from 0% to 12%
and averaged 3.4% across all men reported from all
series (Table 6).
Given the significant decrement in quality of life
imposed by grade 3 or greater toxicity, Nguyen et al.
examined the Dana Farber Cancer Institute/Brigham
and Women’s Hospital series for factors that were
associated significantly with grade 3 or 4 GI or GU
toxicity and observed that an interval <4.5 years
between initial radiation and salvage radiation was
associated significantly with the time to grade 3 or 4
toxicity (hazards ratio [HR], 12.03; 95% confidence
interval [95% CI], 1.44–100; P 5 .02).72 Similarly, an
interval <4.5 years between radiation courses also
was associated with a shorter time to colostomy and
urostomy because of a fistula (HR, 24.6; 95% CI, 1.1–
529; P 5 .04).
Although the rectal injury rate of <5% is similar
across all 3 major forms of local salvage, the 6%
incontinence rate for salvage brachytherapy appears
to be lower than the average of 36% that was estimated for salvage cryotherapy and the 41% average

that was estimated for salvage RP (see Tables 1–6).
The frequency of fistulas and of grade 3 or 4 toxicity
is not very high; however, when they occur, they can
have a significant impact on quality of life. Therefore,
research is needed to identify pretreatment factors
that are associated with the occurrence of grade 3
and 4 complications after all types of salvage local
therapy.

Modalities Under Study for Local Recurrence
In addition to the 3 main salvage therapies discussed
above, there is interest in alternative therapies aimed
at treating local radiation failures with minimal morbidity, although data are limited. In 2004, Gelet et al.
reported on 71 men who received salvage high-intensity focused ultrasonography (HIFU) to the whole
gland after the failure of external beam radiation.81
Currently, HIFU is not practiced in the U.S., but the
30-month rate of freedom from biochemical or histologic failure in that European study was 38%. Morbidity included 7% grade 3 incontinence, 17%
bladder neck stenosis, and 6% rectal fistula, although
follow-up was only 14.8 months and may have
underestimated late toxicity. In addition, Master
et al. of UCSF have described ferromagnetic thermal
ablation of local recurrence in a series of 14 men,
and there has been a planning study on salvage interstitial microwave thermal therapy after brachytherapy as well as a case report of external beam
radiation after local failure on brachytherapy.82–84

1426

CANCER

Currently, each of these modalities requires more
study before they can be compared with other salvage therapies that have more data available.

Conclusions
After critically reviewing the literature, based on the
retrospective nature of the comparisons, it is not
possible to ascertain whether PSA outcome is best after salvage prostatectomy, cryosurgery, or brachytherapy. Only a prospective randomized trial can make
definitive statements regarding comparative outcomes, and such studies are needed.
The men who are most likely to have local-only
disease at the time of PSA failure and, thus, who are
most likely to benefit from salvage local therapy can
be selected based on factors identified in the literature, including initial low-risk disease (PSA <10 ng/
mL, Gleason score 6, clinical T1c or T2a tumor status), pretreatment PSA velocity <2.0 ng/mL per year
at the time of initial presentation, interval to PSA
failure >3 years, PSA-DT >12 months, negative bone
scan and pelvic imaging studies, and positive
rebiopsy.
In addition, prognostic factors have emerged
that are associated with lower rates of PSA recurrence by 5 years after any of the salvage local therapies, and these include a presalvage PSA level <10
ng/mL and a presalvage Gleason score <7 read from
a biopsy specimen without significant RT effect. Also,
there is evidence from the salvage prostatectomy and
cryotherapy series to suggest that patients with bulky
or locally advanced clinical T3/T4 disease at the time
of salvage have a very low likelihood of being cured
by a salvage local therapy. Patients who meet the
above criteria likely will have relatively low-volume
and relatively indolent disease and, thus, also should
have a life expectancy >10 years to have a reasonable chance of gaining a benefit from salvage therapy
that will justify the toxicity of therapy.
Complications after any salvage local therapy in
the post-RT setting are significant; therefore, these
techniques should be performed only on study or by
a physician in a center of excellence with significant
prior experience. Patient selection may help reduce
morbidity by avoiding salvage modalities in patients
with pre-existing bladder and/or bowel toxicity from
prior RT. Additional efforts currently are underway to
reduce the long-term morbidities of these therapies,
and there is evidence to suggest that morbidity outcomes have been improving over time.80 Conversely,
most of the series that we examined in this review
reported on patients who received RT in the conventional or lower dose era (66–70 gray [Gy]); and,
because many patients now are moving to higher

radiation doses for their primary therapy (75.6–79.2
Gy), it is unknown whether morbidity from a salvage
local therapy will be more severe for the patients
who receive initial high-dose radiation.85,86
Although urinary incontinence appears to be
greater after salvage RP (41%) or cryosurgery (36%)
than after salvage brachytherapy (6%), patients who
receive salvage brachytherapy face a 17% risk of
grade 3 or 4 genitourinary complications and a fistula
risk that ranges from 0% to 11% and averages 3.4%
across all series. Additional research is needed to
identify the factors associated with an increased
risk of significant complications after salvage local
therapies to help improve patient selection and to
augment the benefit/risk ratio associated with
attempts to cure local-only recurrences after radiation therapy.
