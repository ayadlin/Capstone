Innovative Cancer Therapies
Putting Costs Into Context
David Khayat, MD, PhD

The costs of cancer care are rising, and spending on expensive innovative anticancer agents is likely to come under
scrutiny as health care payers are confronted by the challenge of resource limits in the face of infinite demand. Indirect costs account for the major part of total attributable costs of cancer and are dominated by the cost of mortality
in individuals of working age (who therefore do not contribute to economic productivity). Although cancer is a leading cause of morbidity and premature mortality, in 2007, it was estimated that cancer accounted for only around 6%
of the total health care costs in Europe. It is estimated that cancer drug costs constitute around 12% of total direct
cancer costs and 5% of the costs of all drugs. Countries vary in their uptake of novel anticancer agents. However,
even in France—a leading nation for the use of these agents—the costs of innovative anticancer drugs accounted for
<0.6% of total health care expenditure in 2006. Population-level data suggest that novel therapies have contributed
(together with advances in screening and other aspects of care) to improvements in survival from cancer. If this is
the case, then the potential reduction in the associated indirect costs could exceed the direct costs associated with
the uptake of innovative drug therapies. Further research is required to establish the costs and benefits of novel

INTRODUCTION
Cancer care spending rose in many European countries during the first half of this decade.1 Health care payers are
challenged by resource limits in the face of infinite demand and the current economic crisis.2 Innovative, molecular-targeted anticancer drugs (eg, rituximab, trastuzumab, and bevacizumab) have roles within recommended treatment regimens for certain malignancies3-6; however, spending on these agents is likely to be scrutinized, because their relatively high
acquisition costs are an identifiable target for reduction, whereas their benefits may appear modest.
Cancer Incidence and Mortality
Cancer incidence is rising, with approximately 2.3 million new cases diagnosed in the 25 European Union countries in
2006.7 French data illustrate the rate of increase; the age-standardized incidence of cancer increased by 38% from 1980 to
2005.
Although cancer incidence is rising, mortality rates are stable or decreasing, and survival times are increasing. The
EUROCARE-4 study, which included data from 47 cancer registries, demonstrated improved age-adjusted 5-year survival
for all cancers diagnosed from 2000 to 2002 compared with the previous decade.8 Particular improvements occurred in
colorectal, breast, and prostate cancer patients.7,9 Reasons for this falling mortality are not clear and may reflect improvements in screening, diagnosis, and treatment.
Despite this favorable trend, cancer caused approximately 1.2 million deaths across European Union countries in
2006.7 Cancer is the leading cause of premature death, being responsible for 1 in 4 deaths among women and 1 in 3 deaths
among men.9 Cancers are responsible for 2.3 million years of potential life lost annually in France (Table 1)10,11 and

approximately 10 million disease-adjusted life years lost
across the European Union in 2002. This makes cancer
third only to mental illness and cardiovascular disease in
terms of disease burden.12
Cancer Cost
As President of the French National Cancer Institute,10 I
asked leading French health economists to determine cancer costs in France. Their report indicated that these costs
can be divided into direct costs (including inpatient/outpatient care, prevention, screening, and research) and
indirect costs (including loss of production and productivity). Direct costs evaluate the cost of curative care
administered by health care professionals and institutions,
eg, costs associated with inpatient care, prescription medicines, and radiotherapy. They do not cover all administered care, and palliative care in particular may not be
covered.10 Indirect cancer costs are evaluated using 2 different methods: the human capital method, which
attempts to estimate the loss of individual income caused
by premature death (or economic costs of the lost years of
life) and the of the friction costs method, which measures
the loss of income related to the absence of an individual
from the workplace.10
Total cancer costs in France were approximately €29
billion in 2004 (Table 2)10; direct costs represented <9%
of the total health budget (€140 billion)—a relatively low
figure given the burden of cancer. Across Europe, it is estimated that cancer accounted for only 6.3% of health care
costs,13 varying from 3% to 5% in Eastern European
countries and up to 7.2% in Germany and Sweden.

Indirect cancer costs in France in 2004 amounted to
€17.5 billion (approximately 45% higher than the direct
cost).10 Indirect cost is dominated by the loss of economic
production caused by premature death; at €16.9 billion,
the cost of lost production attributable to cancer mortality
in France in 2004 represents 97% of indirect costs (Table

2). This figure far exceeds the direct costs of cancer care
(€11.9 billion). Similarly, in Sweden, indirect costs
accounted for 70% of total breast cancer costs in 2002.
Lost production caused by premature death accounted for
52% of the indirect costs.14 Therefore, dying from cancer
costs significantly more than treating this disease.
Across Europe, cancer drugs account for 5% of all
drug costs.13 Drug costs averaged 12% of total direct cancer costs, although this varied between 5% and 9% in
Norway, the United Kingdom, Switzerland, and Denmark and >20% in the Czech Republic, Hungary, and
Poland. Although cancer care often is viewed as costly, the
direct per-patient costs (Fig. 1), and the proportion of
costs attributed to drug therapy (Fig. 2) are lower than
those for other chronic diseases.15
Do Innovative Cancer Therapies Offer Value
for Money?
It is estimated that the total sales of oncology drugs in 25
countries (including 19 European countries) have
increased 5-fold from 1995 to 2005.13 In France, the cost
of innovative cancer therapies rose from €335 million in
2003 to €714 million in 2006. According to the French
Pharmaceutical Companies Association, in 2006, drug
costs in France accounted for approximately 20% of the
social security health budget (approximately €28 billion).
However, innovative anticancer drugs were responsible
for just €0.75 billion, or <0.6%, of this total.

Spending on cancer drugs is expected to continue
increasing, although the rate of increase may fall as generic
versions of newer therapies are introduced and competition
increases.1 The use of more expensive technologies does not
necessarily translate into an increase in the total cost associated with an illness. Newer drugs may lower the demand
for other medical services (eg, hospitalization),16 whereas
increased survival could lower societal costs1—an aspect
that remains under researched.17 Moreover, cost-effectiveness of an anticancer agent may improve as it is used earlier
in therapy wherein it prevents disease recurrence.18
Do innovative cancer treatments improve survival?
Randomized clinical trials have demonstrated statistically
significant, incremental improvements in survival with
some molecular-targeted agents in certain indications,
including lung,19,20 breast,21,22 and colon cancers23 and
hematologic malignancies.24-27 Epidemiological data also
support a survival benefit of newer therapies in some
malignancies; data from the Cancer Registry of Norway
indicate that the per-inhabitant use of vinorelbine from
1999 to 2005 was correlated inversely with the risk of
death in patients with nonsmall cell lung cancer.28 Data
from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results
Program in the United States also reveal improvements in
the survival of patients with hematologic malignancies.2937
In some cases, these changes have been attributed to
new technologies. However, these data do not allow the
direct quantification of the impact of specific treatments.
Furthermore, current data analyses to the middle of the
current decade do not yet reflect the impact of recently
introduced therapies.

Commentary

Researchers at Sweden’s Karolinska Institute analyzed the relation between the availability of new anticancer drugs and the associated effect on survival in 3
different ways.13 First, according to 1 analysis, 44% of the
improvement in cancer survival rates from 1992 to 2000
at 50 US cancer centers could be attributed to newer anticancer drugs. Second, 14% to 19% of the intercountry
differences in 5-year cancer survival rates across 5 major
European Union countries were because of the uptake of
newer drugs (after 1985). Finally, these researchers modeled the effect of newer drug ‘‘vintages’’ on cancer mortality (adjusted for age and gross domestic product) in 20
countries from 1995 to 2003; adjusted mortality
decreased by approximately 16% during this period, and
the use of newer drugs accounted for 30% of this trend
(ie, an absolute reduction of approximately 5%).13
The Karolinska study was criticized for flawed data
and methodology,38,39 with more rapid access to innovative drug therapy suggested as a surrogate marker of other
factors that prolong survival, including improved diagnosis.38,39 However, although the Karolinska data have limitations, they are worth considering.
Access
Substantial disparities exist between European countries in
per capita spending on novel anticancer agents. According
to 2005 data, France, Switzerland, and Austria were the
leading European nations.13 By 2005, the use of trastuzumab in France was approximately 50% higher than the
European average. Data from 2007 to 2008 suggest that
uptake of new agents remains high in France, moderate in
Germany and Italy, and low in the United Kingdom.1
Access to new anticancer drugs in France has been
improved by several measures. More than 75% of health
care funding in France is provided by the National Social
Security system.40 Cancer care is covered under the Affections de Longue Durée and French patients receive full
reimbursement of their health care costs. In 2004, I persuaded the French government to set up a new locus by
which hospitals receive full, unrestricted state reimbursement for costly innovative anticancer drugs. This freed
clinicians to prescribe novel agents according to clinical
need, although it was contingent on meeting specific criteria with full reimbursement only realized when drugs are
prescribed according to the ‘‘good use’’ contract. During
the 5 years after the introduction of this legislation, expenditure on cancer drugs increased from €230 million to
€1 billion, suggesting substantial under use of innovative
therapies before 2004.

2370

Access to an effective drug can be delayed by regulatory approval even when data support its use. In 2005, I
lobbied the French government to establish the Temporary Treatment Protocol (PTT) to help prevent delays.
The PTT convenes a panel of experts to assess data concerning new indications for drugs that are already
approved (eg, in 2005, it was demonstrated that trastuzumab provides significant benefits as adjuvant treatment
for breast cancer,41,42 but it approved only for metastatic
disease; therefore, patients could not benefit from these
findings pending regulatory review). The PTT panel
reviews new data, and, if it expects that a drug will be
granted a new indication by the European Medicines
Agency, patients are given immediate access in that indication. If the drug gains this indication, then patients continue to be treated. If not, then access is stopped.
In conclusion, the adoption of novel anticancer
therapies into clinical practice is vital to reduce cancer
mortality rates. The potential reduction in indirect cancer
costs could exceed the direct costs of therapy as well as
providing patient benefits. In France, where innovative
drugs are fully reimbursed subject to a ‘‘good use’’ contract, such benefits were achieved in 2006 using a relatively small proportion of the health care budget. The
French health care system differs from that of many other
countries, but the key issue is the cost in proportion to the
total health care budget, rather than who pays. Crucially,
well designed, noninterventional, postapproval studies are
required to properly assess the costs and benefits of innovative anticancer drugs.
