Abstract
Intrinsic and acquired tumor drug resistance limits the therapeutic efficacy
of camptothecins (CPTs). Downregulation of the mitotic kinase PLK1 was found
associated with apoptosis induced by SN38 (CPT11 active metabolite). We
investigated the role of PLK1 in the cell response to CPTs in squamous cell carcinoma
(SCC) and pediatric sarcoma cell lines and explored the therapeutic potential of the
combination of CPT11 and the PLK1 inhibitor BI2536 in CPT-sensitive and -resistant
tumor models. Gain- and loss-of-function experiments established a direct role for
PLK1 in counteracting SN38 antiproliferative and pro-apoptotic effects. The ability
to activate an efficient G2/M cell cycle checkpoint allowing PLK1 ubiquitination
and degradation was found associated with SN38-induced apoptosis in SCC cells.
However, the synergistic interaction between SN38 and BI2536 enhanced apoptosis
in cell lines both sensitive and resistant to SN38-induced apoptotic cell death. A
well-tolerated CPT11/BI2536 cotreatment resulted in improved antitumor effect
against SCC xenografts in mice compared to single agent treatments. The increased
apoptosis induction was reflected in a high rate of complete responses and cures in
mice harboring SCC, including tumors with intrinsic or acquired resistance to CPTs.
PLK1 inhibition represents a promising strategy to improve the antitumor efficacy of
CPT11-based regimens.

INTRODUCTION

rational combinatorial strategies continues to be a goal in
the effort to optimize the treatment therapeutic efficacy
[3]. In fact, CPTs share with other cytotoxic drugs doselimiting toxicities, which may prevent the use of effective
doses. Additional limitations to the clinical efficacy of
CPTs are related to tumor intrinsic and acquired drug
resistance, which represent the main cause of therapeutic
failure [2, 4].
CPTs’ activity relies on a highly specific mechanism
of action. These drugs target with high selectivity DNA
topoisomerase I (Top1) and, by docking at the enzymeDNA interface, induce the formation of stable Top1-DNA
cleavable complexes thus preventing DNA strand re-

Camptothecin (CPT) derivatives are potent cytotoxic
drugs that have shown clinical activity in a variety of
human tumors. The two CPTs currently approved in
cancer therapy, topotecan (TPT) and irinotecan (CPT11),
are used for treatment of glioblastomas, sarcomas and
cancers of the cervix [1, 2]. CPT11, which functions as
a pro-drug requiring conversion to the active metabolite
SN38 by plasma and cellular carboxylesterases, is also
used in gastrointestinal malignancies [1, 2]. As with most
chemotherapeutics, CPTs are usually administered in
combination with other agents and the discovery of new

ligation. Following the collision of cleavable complexes
with the replication or transcription machinery, Top1linked DNA single-strand breaks can be converted to
double-strand breaks which are responsible for the drug
cytotoxic activity [2, 3, 5]. Drug induced double-strand
breaks also trigger a DNA damage response characterized
by activation of serine-threonine kinases driving the ATMCHK2 and ATR-CHK1 mediated checkpoint pathways
and cell cycle arrest at the G1/S and G2/M cell cycle phase
transitions. Depending on the extent of DNA lesions,
activation of DNA damage signaling results in DNA repair
or programmed cell death [2]. Combination strategies able
to promote tumor cell death may result in clinical benefit.
Indeed, combining DNA damaging drugs with modulators
of cell cycle checkpoints is an emerging approach pursued
to improve therapeutic index and clinical efficacy [6].
Polo-like kinase 1 (PLK1) belongs to a family of
serine/threonine kinases (PLK1-4) involved in cell cycle
regulation [7, 8, 9]. PLK1 controls several steps of the
cell cycle and is essential for the G2/M transition and cell
division. In addition, it is a crucial component of the DNA
damage response pathway. Its inactivation mediated by the
ATM/ATR signaling is needed for induction of the G2/M
checkpoint, whereas its kinase activity is required for
checkpoint termination and cell cycle reentry following
DNA damage arrest [8, 10-12]. PLK1 overexpression,
reported in several human tumor types, has been correlated
with bad prognosis. These features make it an attractive
target for cancer therapy [13-18]. Indeed, depletion of
PLK1 gene expression results in inhibition of proliferation
due to accumulation in the mitotic phase and apoptosis
induction in tumor cell lines [7, 8]. Among several small
molecule PLK1 inhibitors developed in preclinical studies,
a few, including the dihypteridinones BI2536 and BI6727
(volasertib), have entered clinical evaluation [18-22].
In a previous study, we observed that an early
and significant apoptosis induction by the CPT ST1968
was associated with a marked reduction of PLK1 levels
in human squamous and ovarian cancer cell lines [23].
Here, we explored the role of PLK1 in the sensitivity of
cell lines of different tumor types to SN38 and evaluated
pharmacological inhibition of PLK1 in preclinical models
as an approach to enhance CPT11 antitumor activity and
overcome drug resistance.

of treatment with SN38, the active metabolite of CPT11,
in squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) cell lines previously
characterized for sensitivity to the CPTs [24, 25]. Loss of
PLK1 was observed after exposure to SN38 in CaSki cells,
sensitive to CPT-induced apoptosis, and not in SiHa cells
which are intrinsically resistant to SN38-induced apoptotic
cell death as evidenced by Tunel assay performed on both
SCC cell lines after treatment at equitoxic and equimolar
concentrations (Suppl. Table 1 and Fig. 1A). Accordingly,
downregulation of PLK1, associated with caspase-3
cleavage, was only found in lysates from CaSki tumor
xenografts, grown sc in mice, after a single dose of CPT11
(Fig. 1B). These findings confirmed the relationship
between PLK1 protein downregulation and apoptotic cell
death in response to CPTs occurring both in vitro and in
vivo in SCC models.
The association between the two events was further
investigated in pediatric sarcoma cell lines as additional
tumor models, since a role as survival kinase has been
demonstrated for PLK1 in such tumor types [26, 27].
As shown in Figure 1C, in the Ewing’s sarcoma cells
TC71 exposed to drug concentrations around the IC50
and IC80 [28] (and Suppl. Table 2), PLK1 downregulation
paralled a remarkable apoptotic cell response evidenced
by caspase-3 and PARP cleavage. Similar effects were
observed in another Ewing’s sarcoma family of tumors
(ESFT) cell line, SK-N-MC. Apoptosis induction was
further confirmed by a marked increase in the number of
TUNEL–positive cells after SN38 treatment (Fig. 1C).
Conversely, in the rhabdomyosarcoma cell line RD, less
sensitive to the growth inhibitory activity of CPTs with
respect to the ESFT cell lines [28] (and Suppl. Table 2),
exposure to SN38 did not result in modulation of PLK1
protein levels or in apoptotic cell death (Suppl.Fig. 1A).

SN38-induced PLK1 downregulation is a marker
of efficient G2/M DNA damage checkpoint
Since both transcriptional and posttranslational
mechanisms have been involved in the regulation of
PLK1 expression [12, 29, 30], we investigated whether
these regulatory processes could account for differences
in PLK1 modulation in SCC cell lines. CPT-mediated
transcriptional downmodulation of mitotic regulators,
including PLK1, has been previously reported [31].
Quantitative RT-PCR results showed that PLK1 mRNA
levels were decreased after 24h of SN38 treatment in
both CaSki and SiHa cells (Fig 2A). Immunoprecipitation
of PLK1 from CaSki cells 6h after 1h of drug exposure
evidenced a dose-dependent increase in the amount of
ubiquitinated PLK1 (Fig 2B). This finding was consistent
with a functional G2/M DNA damage checkpoint
promoting ubiquitination via cullin-based E3 ubiquitin
ligases and subsequent proteasome-dependent degradation
of crucial mitotic regulators such as the dual specificity

RESULTS
Downmodulation of PLK1 is a consistent feature
of the apoptotic cell response to SN38
We investigated whether the relationship between
drug-induced PLK1 downregulation and apoptotic cell
death induction was a consistent event in tumor cell
response to CPTs. To this aim, we examined the effect

phosphatase Cdc25A and PLK1 [11, 12, 30, 32]. Indeed,
in CaSki cells, the downmodulation of PLK1 and Cdc25A
was associated with increased levels of the mitosis
markers phospho-Ser10 H3 and cyclin B1 (Fig 2C).
Analysis of cell cycle distribution evidenced in these cells
a transient drug-induced accumulation of cells in G2/M
phase preceding apoptosis induction (Fig. 2C and Suppl.
Fig. 1B). In contrast, the lack of remarkable changes in the

levels of PLK1 ubiquitination (Fig. 2B) and the absence
of Cdc25A downmodulation observed in SiHa cells
exposed to equimolar concentrations of SN38 (Fig. 2C),
suggested a defective DNA damage checkpoint/signaling.
Accordingly, the analysis of cell cycle distribution and of
nuclear morphology evidenced a persistent drug-induced
accumulation of SiHa cells with a 4N DNA content
despite a low expression of cyclin B1 and phospho-Ser10

evidenced by the electrophoretic mobility shift. Vinculin is shown as a control of protein loading. Lower panels, cell cycle distribution of

histone H3 (Fig. 2C and Suppl Fig. 1B). Furthermore, the
hyperphosphorylation of RPA-2, associated with increased
levels cyclin D1, indicated that SiHa cells had skipped the
G2/M cell cycle phase, directly slipping into a G1-like
phase despite the presence of persistent DNA damage.
Similarly, in sarcoma cells, Cdc25A was downmodulated
in the CPT-sensitive TC71 cells and not in RD cells in
response to SN38 suggesting an impairment of DNA
damage checkpoint in the resistant rhabdomyosarcoma
cell line (Suppl. Fig. 1C). Moreover, Cdc25A appeared
coherently modulated with PLK1 also in the in vivo
setting in SCC from mice treated with CPT11 (Suppl.
Fig. 1D). Thus, the failure to downregulate PLK1 through
ubiquitilation and proteasome-dependent proteolysis
appears to be associated with a less efficient CPT-induced
G2/M checkpoint.

reproducible increase of the mitotic kinase expression
achieved by transient transfection with PLK1 expression
vector, determined a significant decrease of cell sensitivity
to SN38, together with reduced caspase-3 and PARP
cleavage, indicating a weakened apoptosis induction.
These findings confirmed that PLK1 plays a direct role
in determining the cellular outcome in response to CPT
treatment.

Pharmacological targeting of PLK1 kinase
counteracts intrinsic and acquired resistance to
SN38 in vitro
Since the above experiments, based on molecular
approaches, suggested PLK1 as an attractive target
for sensitizing cells to CPTs, we investigated whether
the responsiveness of SN38-resistant cellular models
could be modulated by pharmacological inhibition of
PLK1 enzymatic activity. BI2536, a highly selective
PLK1 inhibitor [19, 34, 35] displayed comparable
antiproliferative effects on both CPT-resistant and
-sensitive cell lines (Suppl. Table 1). Similarly to the
behavior observed in PLK1-silenced SiHa cells, PLK1
inhibition by BI2536 resulted in increased accumulation
of cells with G2/M DNA content and mitosis (Fig 4A).
We designed combination experiments with SN38
and BI2536 according to the Chou-Talalay method [36].
Whereas the simultaneous treatment of SiHa cells with the
two drugs did not result in a favorable drug interaction,
cell exposure to the CPT, followed 24h later by the
PLK1 inhibitor, produced a synergistic inhibition of cell
growth as evidenced by dose-effect plot and confirmed by
combination index (CI) less than 1 (Fig. 4B). In addition,
the combined treatment enhanced the apoptotic cell
response with a significant increase of caspase-3 cleavage
and TUNEL positivity (Fig. 4B). A similar effect was
observed when the CPT-resistant rhabdomyosarcoma cells
RD were exposed to the sequential combination treatment
(Suppl. Fig 2A).
Next, we exploited the availability of a human SCC
experimental model of acquired drug resistance consisting
of the pair of isogenic cell lines A431 and the TPT-resistant
variant (A431/TPT) cross-resistant to SN38 in vitro ([24]
and Fig. 4C) and to CPT11 in vivo [37]. Again, in this
system, the sequential exposure to SN38 and BI2536
resulted in a synergistic interaction (Suppl. Fig. 2A).
Moreover, a significant apoptosis increase was observed
in both sensitive and resistant cells after treatment with
equitoxic concentrations of the CPT (Fig. 4C).
These findings indicated that inhibition of PLK1
enzymatic activity could enhance apoptosis in tumor cell
lines characterized by intrinsic or acquired resistance to
CPTs.

Modulation of PLK1 expression affects cell
sensitivity to SN38
To assess whether PLK1 directly contributes to
the cellular outcome in response to SN38, we modulated
PLK1 expression in SCC cell lines. Figure 3A shows
that, in SiHa cells, PLK1 knockdown by siRNA resulted
in a marked inhibition of cell growth (about 60%) and
in the accumulation of mitotic and apoptotic cells. The
occurrence of a mitotic arrest [33] was also supported
by the enhancement of M phase markers (i.e. cyclin
B1, phospho-Ser10 histone H3 and MPM-2) and by
the accumulation of cells with 4N DNA content. The
induction of apoptotic cell death by PLK1 silencing was
confirmed by increased number of TUNEL positive cells
and processing of caspase-3. Coherently, Hoechst nuclei
staining showed the coexistence of aberrant mitoses
and nuclei with apoptotic features in the silenced cell
population (not shown). These data indicated that also in
the CPT-resistant SiHa cells, PLK1 plays a prosurvival
role and that reluctance of these cells to SN38 cytotoxicity
was not related to defects in the apoptotic machinery.
We next investigated the impact of PLK1
downmodulation on SCC cell sensitivity to SN38.
As shown in Fig. 3B, an increased CPT-induced
antiproliferative activity was observed in PLK1 silenced
SiHa cells, with a marked reduction of the IC50 (1µM in
cells with control siRNA vs <0.1 µM in cells with PLK1
siRNA). This effect was associated with a significant
enhacement of apoptosis detected by the TUNEL
positivity and the proteolytic cleavage of caspase-3 and
PARP in PLK1-silenced SN38-treated cells.
To get further insights into the role of PLK1
expression levels in cell response to SN38, we applied
a gain- and loss-of function approach to the CaSki cell
line. As in SiHa cells, PLK1 dowmodulation by siRNA
was able to enhance the antiproliferative and proapoptotic
effects of SN38 (Fig. 3C). Coherently, a slight but

CPT11 and BI2536 cooperate in potentiating the
antitumor effect against SCC xenografts

Similarly, in SiHa tumor carrying mice, the combination
yielded an impressive rate of tumor regressions with 10/10
mice experiencing complete responses and 3/10 animals
without evidence of disease at the end of the experiment.
In both SCC models, the increased efficacy of the
combination versus single agent treatment was highlighted
by the increased LCK, indicating the delayed recovery of
the fraction of regrowing tumors.
Next, we tested the antitumor efficacy of the CPT11BI2536 combined treatment against the couple of A431
and A431/TPT tumor xenografts. Given the known
hypersensitivity of A431 to CPTs [24, 25, 37], CPT11
was delivered at the 20 mg/kg dose which produced in
this model 87% TVI with 4/8 cured mice at the end of
experiment (Table 1 and Fig. 5B). The combination of
CPT with an almost ineffective dose of BI2536 resulted in
a marked improvement of the antitumor activity with 99%
TVI, 7/8 complete responses and 6/8 cured mice. Western
blot analysis of A431 tumor specimens following a single
administration of CPT11, followed by BI2536, revealed an
increased PARP cleavage, indicating that the combination
treatment was able to promote apoptosis also in vivo (Fig.
5B).
Administration of the same drug doses employed
for the A431 model significantly improved the antitumor

The antitumor efficacy of CPT11 and BI2536
cotreatment was assessed in nude mice bearing SCC
xenografts in a sequential schedule resembling the in
vitro treatments (i.e. CPT11 injected ip on days 4; 8;
12; 16 followed, 24h after each CPT dose, by BI2536
iv). Administration of 40 mg/kg CPT11 alone to mice
bearing CaSki xenografts resulted in a marked inhibition
of tumor growth (94 % TVI), 1/10 complete response
and maintenance of tumor growth delay for about one
week after treatment interruption (Table 1 and Fig. 5A).
As expected, SiHa tumors were less responsive to CPT11
treatment (84% TVI) with respect to CaSki tumors (Table
1 and Fig. 5B). In both SCC models, BI2536 administered
as single agent at the 25 mg/kg dose, produced a moderate
but significant inhibition of tumor growth (69% TVI,
P<0.01, CaSki; 52% TVI, P<0.05, SiHa). In mice
bearing CaSki tumors, the combination of CPT11 and
BI2536 resulted in a significant implementation of TVI.
Moreover, 8/10 mice experienced complete responses and
4/10 animals showed no evidence of disease at the end
of the experiment 84 days after the last BI2536 delivery,
testifying the curative potential of the combined treatment.

effect of the combination as compared to single agent
treatments, also in mice bearing A431/TPT tumors,
although without recording complete responses (Table
1). When higher doses of both drugs were used, an even
improved benefit was observed with 100% of complete
responses and 5/8 cures in mice receiving both drugs. Of

note, the CPT11-BI2536 cotreatment was well tolerated
(body weight loss <10% and no lethal toxicity). Thus,
the addition of the PLK1 inhibitor to CPT11 provided a
remarkable improvement of the therapeutic efficacy in all
the SCC models tested.

PLK1 downmodulation, as previously reported in response
to CPT [31], cannot be excluded, the lower levels of
ubiquitin binding to PLK1, observed in SiHa with respect
to CaSki cells, were consistent with a defective activation/
engagement of the cullin-based E3 ubiquitin ligases and
proteasomal degradative processes [32]. Indeed, it has
been reported that cells expressing a mutant form of PLK1
resistant to APC/CCdh1-mediated ubiquitination display a
greater tendency to escape DNA damage checkpoint and
enter mitosis despite the presence of DNA damage foci
[11]. In SiHa cells which are unable to downregulate
PLK1 following SN38 treatment, the DNA content, along
with markers of cell cycle phase and the long-lasting
hyperphosphorylation of RPA-2, indicated checkpoint
escape and mitotic slippage despite the persistence of
DNA damage.
Given the perspective of fostering the susceptibility
to undergo apoptosis of either CPT-sensitive or –resistant
tumor cells, we explored the therapeutic potential of
a combination treatment with CPTs and PLK1 kinase
inhibitors. PLK1 stands out as a promising target for
molecular intervention in oncology and several small
molecules targeting PLK1 are currently under clinical
investigation [6, 7, 15, 18, 22, 39]. The dihydropteridinone
BI2536 was the first PLK1 inhibitor investigated in
patients with solid tumors, whereas current clinical
studies favor the structurally related BI6727 (Volasertib,
now entering Phase III) endowed with an improved
pharmacokinetic profile [18, 21, 22, 40]. Pharmacological
inhibition of PLK1 by BI2536 treatment in SCC cells
resulted in the typical “Polo phenotype” [7] characterized
by perturbed mitoses and apoptotic nuclei. Such
phenotype resembled that observed following PLK1 RNA
interference in the CPT- resistant SiHa cells, indicating
that the impairment of the mitotic kinase enzymatic
activity was sufficient to promote cell death. Accordingly,
the combination treatment with SN38 and BI2536 resulted
in a synergistic inhibition of cell growth and a marked
enhancement of the apoptotic response. Moreover, the
combination was able to implement antiproliferative effect
and cell death in both the CPT-sensitive A431 cells and
in A431/TPT cells characterized by acquired resistance to
TPT and cross-resistant to SN38 ([24] and data herein).
Importantly, a striking enhancement of antitumor
activity was obtained by CPT11 and BI2536 administered
in combination to SCC xenografts bearing mice in a
well-tolerated sequential schedule. Analysis of tumors
showed enhanced apoptosis in mice treated with the
combination, which was reflected in a remarkable number
of complete tumor regressions. The improvement of
tumor response also in models characterized by intrinsic
and acquired resistance to CPTs further supported the
therapeutic potential of the combination treatment. The
combination of CPT11 with PLK1 targeting agents
was previously assessed in neuroblastoma and colon
carcinoma xenografts, although the molecular mechanisms

In this study, we provided preclinical rationale and
mechanistic insights into a drug combinatory approach
based on the use of PLK1 inhibitors to improve CPT-based
antitumor therapies.
In previous studies designed to investigate the cell
response to a novel Top1 poison, ST1968, we noticed that
the susceptibility of human SCC and ovarian cancer cells
to an early and significant CPT-induced apoptosis was
associated with a marked reduction of the PLK1 protein
[23]. Here, we assessed the concomitance of an efficient
CPT-induced cell death and PLK1 downmodulation
in a panel of SCC and pediatric sarcoma cell lines, and
confirmed that PLK1 levels were not modulated in cells
resistant to CPT-induced apoptosis.
PLK1 is a serine/threonine kinase that finely
controls mitosis by regulating the activity of the anaphasepromoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C) and, ultimately,
cell division [8, 12, 16]. In a wide range of pediatric
tumors, including ESFTs characterized by high levels of
PLK1, this kinase has been described as one of the most
important survival kinases and a promising therapeutic
target [26, 27]. By applying gene silencing and forced
exogenous expression, we demonstrated that PLK1 acts
as a prosurvival/antiapoptotic kinase also in SCC cells.
These findings suggested that, even in this context, the
mitotic kinase might represent a valuable target per se,
and an exploitable target to foster chemotherapy-induced
apoptosis. Indeed, the CPT11 active metabolite SN38
displayed an increased antiproliferative and proapoptotic
activity in PLK1-silenced SiHa cells as compared to
the intrinsically CPT resistant parental cells, thereby
establishing a direct role for PLK1 in determining the
cellular outcome in response to SN38. PLK1 is known
to enhance cell tolerance to stress [16, 38]. Therefore,
in conditions of stalled replication forks, known to be
induced by CPTs [2, 3, 5], PLK1 inhibition is expected to
induce stress sensitization by blocking the recovery from
cell cycle arrest [38]. The failure of cells to downregulate
PLK1 in response to CPTs can be related to a defective
DNA damage checkpoint whereas it is not directly
linked to overall level of protein expression (Suppl. Fig
2C). In fact, activation of a competent G2/M checkpoint
requires a block of the pro-mitotic signals, including
Cdc25A and PLK1 activity which is essential for the
G2/M transition in cells attempting to recover from DNA
damage [9, 16, 32]. Abrogation of PLK1 activity may
occur by different strategies, including transcriptional
repression and proteasome–mediated degradation [11, 12,
29, 30]. In our SCC cell lines, we did not find a direct
correlation between inhibition of PLK1 transcription
and PLK1 downregulation after SN38 treatment. In
fact, a reduction of PLK1 mRNA levels was observed in
both drug sensitive and resistant cell lines. Although a
contribution of transcriptional inhibition to SN38-induced

underlying the antitumor efficacy were not elucidated [41,
42]. Of note, we performed our study in a panel of cell
lines defective for p53 function as a consequence of gene
mutation or Human Papilloma Virus (HPV) infection
(http://p53.fr), [43]. A complex interplay exists between
PLK1 and p53 involving mutual negative regulation
at several molecular levels [16, 44, 45, 46]. Since
there is evidence of a contribution of PLK1 in cellular
transformation induced by viral oncoproteins including
those from HPVs [16, 47], the combinatory approach
proposed in our study might be of particular clinical
interest in SCC.
Overall our data demonstrating a direct role for
PLK1 in cell response to CPT11 highlight a novel
rationale-based strategy to increase the therapeutic
efficacy of CPT-containing regimens and to promote
chemosensitization of resistant tumors.

cells were incubated in the continuous presence of SN38.
SCC cells were exposed to the CPT for 1h then cells were
washed and incubated in drug-free medium. All cell lines
were exposed to BI2536 continuously.
The antiproliferative activity was evaluated
after 72h from drug exposure by cell counting using a
Coulter Counter (Coulter Electronics, Luton, UK). Drug
concentrations able to inhibit cell proliferation by 50%
(IC50) and 80% (IC80) were calculated from dose-response
curves. The SN38/BI2536 combination treatment was
assayed designing schedule treatments according to the
Chou-Talalay method [36]. Cells were exposed to drugs
at a constant-ratio in a sequential schedule consisting of
exposure to SN38 for 1h followed, the day after, by the
PLK1 inhibitor for additional 48 h. Drug interaction was
analyzed by the CalcuSyn Software (Biosoft, Cambridge,
UK) and expressed as combination index (CI). By
this method, CI=1 indicates an additive effect, CI<1
synergism, and CI>1 antagonism.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Western blot analysis and immunoprecipitation

Cell lines and culture conditions

Cells were processed for total protein extraction or
immunoprecipitation as previously described in details
[48]. Briefly, for immunoprecipitation of Plk1, cell
lysates were incubated with protein A/G PLUS-Agarose
(Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) and antiPlk1 antibody (diluted 1:100, Cell Signaling Technology,
Danvers, MA), for 24 h at 4 °C. Immunoprecipitates were
then washed and eluted as described [48]. Lysates from
frozen tumors were prepared as reported [37]. Briefly,
tumors were pulverized by the Mikro-Dismembrator II
(B. Brown Biotech International, Melsungen, Germany)
and suspended in lysis buffer supplemented with protease
and phosphatase inhibitors. Proteins from whole tumors,
cell lysates or immunoprecipitates were separated by
SDS-PAGE, transferred on nitrocellulose and analyzed
for detection of specific proteins or phosphorylation
as described [48]. Where indicates, band intensities
were quantified by ImageJ software by pixel-integrated
intensity.

We used four human SCC cell lines, CaSki and
SiHa, from uterine cervix and A431, from skin, along
with the TPT-resistant subline (A431/TPT) selected in our
lab [24], two human Ewing’s sarcoma family of tumor
cell lines SK-N-MC (Askin’s tumor) and TC71 (Ewing’s
sarcoma) and the human embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma
cell line RD. All SCC, SK-N-MC and RD cell lines
were cultured in RPMI-1640 medium (Lonza, Verviers,
Belgium), whereas the TC71 cell line was maintained in
Iscove’s modified Dulbecco’s Medium (Lonza). All cell
lines were grown in medium supplemented with 10% FBS
and maintained in a humidified incubator with 5% CO2 at
37°C. The A431, CaSki and SiHa cell lines were obtained
from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas,
VA). The SK-N-MC cell line was kindly provided by R.
Maggi (University of Milan, Italy), the RD cell line by A.
Rosolen (University of Padua, Italy), and the TC71 cell
line by M.C. Manara (Rizzoli Institute, Bologna, Italy).
Cell lines were authenticated by single tandem repeat
analysis by the AmpFISTR Identifiler PCR amplification
kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA).

keeping temperature and constant humidity. Mice had free
access to food and water. Experiments were approved by
the Ethics Committee for Animal Experimentation of the
Fondazione IRCCS Istituto Nazionale dei Tumori of Milan
according to reported guidelines [49].
Tumor fragments obtained by serial sc passages
were implanted on the right flank. Groups of 8-10 mice
bearing one tumor sc were employed. Tumor growth was
monitored by biweekly measurements of tumor diameters
with a Vernier caliper. Tumor volume (TV) was calculated
according to the formula: TV (mm3) = d2xD/2 where d and
D are the shortest and the longest diameter, respectively.
CPT11, dissolved in distilled water, was delivered
ip. BI2536, dissolved in HCl and diluted in saline (0.01N
HCl final concentration), was administered iv. The two
compounds were delivered in a volume of 10 ml/kg of
body weight every 4 days for 4 times (q4dx4) giving
BI2536, in combination experiments, 24h after CPT11.
Treatments started three days after tumor implant, when
nodules were just palpable. The efficacy of drug treatments
was assessed as: tumor volume inhibition percentage
(TVI %) in treated versus control mice, calculated
according to the formula: TVI% = 100-(mean TV treated/
mean TV control x 100); complete regressions (CR), i.e.
disappearance of the tumors lasting at least ten days after
the end of treatments; no evidence of disease (NED), i.e.
mice without tumors at the end of the experiment (100
days after tumor implant); log10 cell kill (LCK) calculated
employing the formula: LCK = (T-C)/(3.32xdT), where
T and C are, respectively, the mean times (days) required
by drug-treated and control tumors to reach the same
volume. DT is the doubling time of control tumors. Drug
tolerability was assessed as body weight loss percent
during treatment, and lethal toxicity, i.e., any death in
treated groups occurring before the end of experiment.

Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) was
performed by the TaqMan PCR Kit (Applied Biosystems,
Foster City, CA) according to manufacturer’s instructions
using TaqMan probes PLK1, Hs00153444_m1; GAPDH,
Hs02758991_g1. The levels of templates in samples were
determined through relative quantitation (RQ) using
comparative CT (ΔΔCT) assay configuration. The data
were normalized by the GAPDH housekeeping gene
detection. Data analysis was performed with Sequence
Detection Systems 2.2.2 software (Applied Biosystems).

PLK1 loss and gain of function studies
Knock-down of PLK1 was performed using siRNAs
for human PLK1 (ON-TARGET plus SMART pool) and
as control, non-targeting siRNAs (On-TARGET plus nonTargeting Pool)(Dharmacon, Colorado, USA). CaSki
and SiHa cells were transiently transfected with control
or PLK1 siRNA at a final concentration of 100 nM using
RNAimax (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA). To increase
PLK1 expression levels, CaSki cells were transfected
using a plasmid containing full length PLK1 cDNA
(Origene, Tema Ricerca, Bologna, Italy) in Lipofectamine
2000 (Invitrogen). Twenty four hours after the transfection
with siRNA or plasmid, cells were treated with SN38.

Mitosis and apoptosis detection
For quantification of mitoses, adherent and floating
cells were collected, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and
permeabilized with cold 100% methanol. Cells, spotted
onto polylisinated microscope slides, were incubated
overnight at 4°C with MPM-2 antibody recognizing
mitosis-specific phosphoepitopes (1:200) (Upstate
Biotechnology) followed by a goat anti-mouse IgG/
rhodamine conjugated antibody (Upstate Biotechnology)
diluted 1:1000. Slides, mounted with Mowiol (Sigma),
were examined by a fluorescence microscope DMRB
(Leitz Microscope, Wetzlar, Germany), and the number of
cells positive for MPM-2 (mitotic) was counted (at least,
300 cells/sample).
Apoptosis was evaluated in floating and adherent
cells by TUNEL (Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase
dUTP Nick End Labeling) assay (Roche, Mannheim,
Germany) according to manufacturer’s instruction.
Samples were analysed by flow cytometry.

Statistical analyses
Analyses by the Student’s 2-tailed t test were
performed using the GraphPad Prism software, version 4.0
(GraphPad Prism Inc., San Diego, CA). P values < 0.05
were considered significant. In antitumor activity studies,
Student’s t and Fisher’s exact test (two-tailed) were used
for statistical comparison of tumor volumes and complete
responses to treatments, respectively, in mice.
