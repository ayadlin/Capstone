P73 is important in drug-induced apoptosis in some cancer
cells, yet its role in the regulation of chemosensitivity
in ovarian cancer (OVCA) is poorly understood. Furthermore, if and how the deregulation of p73-mediated
apoptosis confers resistance to cisplatin (CDDP) treatment is unclear. Here we demonstrate that TAp73a overexpression enhanced CDDP-induced PARP cleavage and
apoptosis in both chemosensitive (OV2008 and A2780s)
and their resistant counterparts (C13* and A2780cp) and
another chemoresistant OVCA cells (Hey); in contrast,
the effect of DNp73a over-expression was variable. P73a
downregulation attenuated CDDP-induced PUMA and
NOXA upregulation and apoptosis in OV2008 cells.
CDDP decreased p73a steady-state protein levels in
OV2008, but not in C13*, although the mRNA expression
was identical. CDDP-induced p73a downregulation was
mediated by a calpain-dependent pathway. CDDP induced
calpain activation and enhanced its cytoplasmic interaction and co-localization with p73a in OV2008, but not
C13* cells. CDDP increased the intracellular calcium
concentration ([Ca2 þ ]i) in OV2008 but not C13* whereas
cyclopiazonic acid (CPA), a Ca2 þ -ATPase inhibitor,
caused this response and calpain activation, p73a processing and apoptosis in both cell types. CDDP-induced
[Ca2 þ ]i increase in OV2008 cells was not effected by the
elimination of extracellular Ca2 þ , but this was attenuated
by the depletion of internal Ca2 þ store, indicating that
mobilization of intracellular Ca2 þ ] stores was potentially
involved. These ﬁndings demonstrate that p73a and its
regulation by the Ca2 þ -mediated calpain pathway are
involved in CDDP-induced apoptosis in OVCA cells and
that dysregulation of Ca2 þ /calpain/p73 signaling may in

Introduction
Chemoresistance is a major concern in cancer chemotherapy and remains an obstacle for the successful
treatment of ovarian cancer (OVCA). Although cisplatin (CDDP) and its derivatives are effective anticancer
agents for OVCA, its efﬁcacy is limited by the development of resistance. Whereas chemoresistance could be
attributed to altered DNA repair, drug transport and
metabolism, deregulation of cell death seems a key
determinant in CDDP resistance in OVCA, resulting
from the upregulation and reduction of either the proor anti-apoptotic factors (Eltabbakh and Awtrey, 2001;
Fraser et al., 2003a).
The expression of the TP73 gene is frequently altered
in cancer and its modulation enhances cancer cell
sensitivity to drug-induced apoptosis (Melino et al.,
2002; Irwin et al., 2003; Vayssade et al., 2005). The gene
products include at least seven spliced isoforms
with different carboxyl termini, termed TA variants
(TAp73a-Z). In addition, the gene product gives rise to
at least another seven isoforms transcribed from a
cryptic promoter in intron 3, these isoforms lack the
TA domain, thus are termed DN variants (DNp73a-Z)
(Pietsch et al., 2008). TAp73 is a transcription factor
that causes cell cycle arrest and apoptosis through the
activation of p53-like target genes such as PUMA and
NOXA (Melino et al., 2003; Muller et al., 2005). It also

activates unique downstream targets, suggesting a role
that is distinct from that of p53 (Fontemaggi et al.,
2002). In contrast, the DNp73 isoforms are transcriptionally inactive and act as endogenous dominant negative
proteins that inhibit both TAp73- and p53-mediated
apoptosis by either competing for the same responsive
elements or by sequestration of the active isoforms into
non-active hetero-tetramers (Muller et al., 2006).
Calpains are a family of widely expressed calcium
(Ca2 þ )-dependent proteases. The most ubiquitously
expressed isoforms, known as m- and m-calpain, are
heterodimers consisting of a distinct large 80-kDa
catalytic subunit and a common small 28-kDa regulatory subunit (Perrin and Huttenlocher, 2002). Calpains
are important regulators of apoptosis by its proteolytic
function in cleaving both pro- (Gao and Dou, 2000) and
anti- (Kobayashi et al., 2002) apoptotic proteins. Ca2 þ
homeostasis is known to have a vital role in apoptosis,
and its modulation inﬂuences the activation of calpains
(Monteith et al., 2007).
P73 degradation is regulated, in part, by the ubiquitin
proteasome pathway (Bernassola et al., 2004; Rossi
et al., 2005; Bernassola et al., 2008). A recent ﬁnding
demonstrated that p73, in addition to the degradation
by the ubiquitin E3 ligase ITCH (Rossi et al., 2005) is a
substrate of calpain in vitro, and that calpain-mediated
cleavage sites are found at both the N- and the C-termini
(Munarriz et al., 2005). However, whether calpainmediated p73 cleavage has a role in the physiological
function of p73 has not been established. The pathophysiological relevance of Ca2 þ homeostasis and calpain
regulation of p73a and the potential contribution of
such pathway to the regulation of CDDP sensitivity in
OVCA cells have not been studied, prompting the
direction of our investigations.
Here we demonstrate that p73a content is regulated by
calpain in CDDP-induced apoptosis in OVCA cells.
CDDP induced TAp73a and DNp73a downregulation/
cleavage in chemosensitive cells, but not in its resistant
counterpart and it is mediated by the calpain pathway.
CDDP induced [Ca2 þ ]i increase and calpain activation,
enhancing its cytoplasmic interaction and co-localization
with p73a in sensitive, but not resistant, cells, potentially
via mobilization of intracellular Ca2 þ stores. These
ﬁndings illustrate a vital role of the Ca2 þ /calpain/p73a
pathway in regulating OVCA cell sensitivity to CDDP.

Results
P73a contributes to CDDP-induced apoptosis in human
ovarian cancer cells
Although p73 is important in drug-induced apoptosis in
some cancer cells (Irwin, 2004; Ozaki and Nakagawara,
2005; Ramadan et al., 2005), its role in the regulation of
chemosensitivity in OVCA is poorly understood; this is
of particular importance because the apoptotic capacity
of ovarian cancer cells appears to be tightly linked to
their sensitivity to chemotherapeutic agents, such as
CDDP (Fraser et al., 2003a). To determine the role
Oncogene

of p73a, two pairs of chemosensitive OVCA cell
lines (OV2008 and A2780s), their resistant isogenic
counterparts (C13* and A2780cp, respectively) and an
additional CDDP-resistant OVCA line (Hey) were
transfected with TAp73a or DNp73a cDNA (2 mg; 24 h)
or with empty pcDNA3.1 vectors and then treated with
CDDP (5 mM, OV2008; 10 mM, C13*, A2780s, A2780cp
and Hey; 24 h). Over-expression of TAp73a and
DNp73a was conﬁrmed by immunoblot (Figures 1a-c).
Whereas TAp73a over-expression consistently enhanced CDDP-induced apoptosis in these cells (OV2008,
A2780s, A2780cp and Hey; Po0.01 and C13*;
Po0.001), the effect of DNp73a over-expression was
variable. Over-expression of DNp73a promoted basal
and CDDP-induced apoptosis in OV2008 and C13*
compared with controls (OV2008, Po0.05); C13*,
Po0.01). In contrast, DNp73a failed to sensitize
A2780s and Hey cells to CDDP-induced apoptosis,
but it did increase the basal apoptosis in A2780cp
cells. The enhancement of CDDP-induced apoptosis by
either isoform was associated with increased cleavage of
PARP, a substrate of caspase-3.
To further examine the role of TAp73a and DNp73a
in the regulation of CDDP sensitivity, OV2008 cells
were transfected with p73a siRNA, targeting both
isoforms (0–100 nM; 48 h), prior to CDDP treatment
(10 mM; 24 h). CDDP alone decreased TAp73a and
DNp73a levels, upregulated the content of the p53responsive gene products PUMA and NOXA and
induced apoptosis (Figure 1d). P73a siRNA markedly
downregulated both TAp73a and DNp73a contents
and signiﬁcantly attenuated these responses induced by
CDDP (Po0.001), thus leaving open the question on
the isoform responsible and their relative balance. P73a
siRNA had no effect on p53 content, suggesting that the
changes in PUMA and NOXA level were speciﬁc to
p73a, and not secondary to a decrease in p53.
CDDP-induced p73a downregulation is mediated by
calpain-dependent pathway
We next determined whether CDDP has a differential
effect on TAp73a and DNp73a expression in chemosensitive and chemoresistant cells. TAp73a was highly
expressed in both cell lines, whereas DNp73a content
was high in OV2008 compared with C13* (Figure 2a).
CDDP signiﬁcantly decreased both TAp73a and
DNp73a contents and induced apoptosis in a concentration-dependent manner in OV2008, but not C13* after
24 h. In contrast, CDDP had no effect on their mRNA
levels in either cell line (Figure 2b). The CDDP-induced
TAp73a and DNp73a downregulation appeared not to
be a consequence of protein degradation secondary to
cell death or of proteasome degradation. Inhibition of
apoptosis by Xiap over-expression or inhibition of the
proteasome pathway failed to signiﬁcantly attenuate
these responses (Supplementary Figure 1A and B).
Calpain regulates the steady-state level of p73 isoforms (Munarriz et al., 2005). To test the involvement of
calpain in CDDP-induced TAp73a and DNp73a processing, OV2008 cells were pre-treated with calpeptin

Figure 1 P73a is required for CDDP-induced apoptosis in OVCA cells. (a) TAp73a over-expression enhanced CDDP-induced PARP
cleavage and apoptosis in OVCA cell lines. The effect of DNp73a over-expression was cell-type speciﬁc. (a) OV2008 and C13*,
(b) A2780s and A2780cp and (c) Hey cells were transfected with either TAp73a cDNA, DNp73a cDNA (2 mg; 24 h) or an empty vector
(CTL) followed by CDDP (10 mM; 24 h). TAp73a and DNp73a over-expression was assessed by western blot (top), and apoptosis by
Hoechst staining (bottom). Effective over-expression of TAp73a and DNp73a was conﬁrmed by western blot using anti-HA antibody.
The expression of HA-TAp73a sensitized all the tested cell lines to CDDP-induced apoptosis when compared with the control groups
(OV2008, A2780s, A2780cp and Hey; Po0.01 and C13*; Po0.001). The effect of HA-DNp73a over-expression was variable.
As observed with TAp73a, the over-expression of DNp73a promoted basal and CDDP-induced apoptosis in OV2008 and C13*
compared with controls (OV2008 (Po0.05); C13* (Po0.01)). In contrast, DNp73a failed to sensitize A2780s and Hey cells to CDDPinduced apoptosis but it did increase the basal level of apoptosis in A2780cp cells. The enhancement of CDDP-induced apoptosis by
either isoform was associated with increased cleavage of PARP, a substrate of caspase-3. (d) P73a downregulation by p73a siRNA
attenuated CDDP-induced PUMA and NOXA upregulation and apoptosis in OV2008. OV2008 cells were transfected with p73a
siRNA (0–100 nM; 48 h) and treated with CDDP (10 mM; 24 h). TAp73a, DNp73a, PUMA and NOXA contents (Top) and apoptosis
(Bottom) were determined by western blot and Hoechst stain, respectively. P73a siRNA markedly downregulated TAp73a and
DNp73a contents (lane 2 vs 1 and lane 4 vs 3) and had no effect on p53 content. TAp73a and DNp73a downregulation signiﬁcantly
attenuated CDDP-induced apoptosis compared with siRNA controlled-group treated with CDDP (Po0.001). Figures indicate the
mean±s.e.m. of three independent experiments assessed by two way-ANOVA (*Po0.05, **Po0.01, ***Po0.001).

Figure 2 CDDP-induced p73a downregulation is calpain-dependent. (a) CDDP decreased both TAp73a and DNp73a contents in
OV2008, but not C13*, in a concentration-dependent manner. OV2008 and C13* cells were treated with different concentrations of
CDDP (0, 2.5, 5 and 10 mM; 24 h). TAp73a and DNp73a content (Top) and apoptosis (Bottom) were assessed as with the previous
methodology (b) CDDP had no effect on TAp73a and DNp73a mRNA abundance in both OV2008 and C13* cells. OV2008 and C13*
were treated with CDDP (10 mM; 24 h). TAp73a and DNp73a mRNA levels were assessed by RT-PCR. Calpain was inhibited by either
calpeptin (c) or speciﬁc calpain siRNA (d) decreased cleaved a-fodrin restored TAp73a and DNp73a content and attenuated CDDPinduced apoptosis. OV2008 cells were pre-treated for 4 h with different concentrations of calpeptin (0, 6.25, 12.5, 25 and 50 mM) or
transfected with calpain siRNA (0–200 nM; 48 h). (e) OV2008 cell lysates were incubated with recombinant calpain 1 for 1 h at 30 1C,
where calpain activity was inhibited by boiling, EGTA and absences of Ca2 þ . (f) OV2008 cells lysate was incubated as above and
calpain was activated by increasing concentration of Ca2 þ . Calpain downregulation, p73a isoforms contents and cleaved a-fodrin and
apoptosis were assessed as above. Results were obtained from the mean±s.e.m. of three independent experiments using two-way
ANOVA (**Po0.01, ***Po0.001).

(exogenous inhibitor; 0–50 mM) and a speciﬁc siRNA
before CDDP treatment (10 mM; 24 h). Both calpeptin
(Figure 2c) and calpain siRNA (Figure 2d) inhibited
calpain activity (as indicated by cleaved a-fodrin),
restored TAp73a and DNp73a contents and attenuated
CDDP-induced apoptosis.
To validate the processing of TAp73a and DNp73a by
calpain in OV2008 cells, their cell lysates were incubated
with recombinant calpain 1 followed by immunoblotting. Ca2 þ -activated calpain 1 induced a-fodrin cleavage
and TAp73a and DNp73a processing; however, these
events were prevented by EGTA or when calpain was
inactivated by boiling (Figure 2e). The Calpain-mediated
a-fodrin cleavage and TAp73a and DNp73a processing
Oncogene

were consistent with the different concentration of Ca2 þ ,
suggesting that calpain activation is controlled by Ca2 þ .
Unfortunately, the antibody used to detect TAp73a and
DNp73a content failed to recognize their cleaved products
induced by calpain 1. Collectively, our studies provided
strong evidence for an involvement of calpain in the
regulation of TAp73a and DNp73a protein level both
alone and in the presence of CDDP.
CDDP induced calpain activation and inﬂuenced its
interaction and co-localization with p73a in
chemosensitive, but not chemoresistant cells
As CDDP induced p73a downregulation only in
chemosensitive cells, we examined the effect of CDDP

Caplain-mediated, p73a pathway in ovarian cancer

on calpain activation. Time course and concentrationresponse studies on the effects of CDDP indicate that
CDDP caused calpain activation, as evident by a-fodrin
cleavage, in a time- and a concentration-dependent
manner in OV2008, but not C13* cells (Figure 3a). This
supports the notion that the absence of CDDP-induced
p73a processing in C13* could be attributed to the lack
of calpain activation.
We then speculated that calpain and p73a isoforms
may interact in the chemosensitive OV2008 cells.
To explore this possibility, OV2008 cells were overexpressed with exogenous HA-TAp73a and HADNp73a and then treated with CDDP (10 mM). Both
proteins were immunoprecipitated with anti-HA antibody, and calpain interaction was then detected by
western blot. Figure 3b showed that both TAp73a and
DNp73a bind to calpain in control and CDDP-treated
groups, suggesting that both isoforms interact with
calpain. To validate that the endogenous proteins also
OV2008

C13*

interact, calpain and p73a interaction was examined by
co-immunoprecipitation. Both p73a isoforms were
successfully co-precipitated with a common anti-p73a
antibody, due to the lack of discriminating antibodies
for each isoforms. In keeping, Figure 3c revealed that
p73a and calpain interact at the endogenous level in
OV2008 cells.
Immunolocalization studies on p73a in OV2008
treated with DMSO (control) showed that p73a was
localized in the nucleus and in the perinuclear region
(Figure 3d). CDDP (10 mM; 24 h) decreased nuclear p73a
immunoreactivity and increased localization in the
perinuclear region. Conversely, p73a immunoactivity
was low or not detectable in the nucleus of C13* and
was not inﬂuenced by CDDP (Figure 3d). Calpain
immunoreactivity in OV2008 cells was found only at the
cytoplasm and was not mediated by CDDP (Figure 3d).
The overlay of p73a and calpain immunosignals
demonstrated that CDDP treatment of OV2008 cells

resulted in the co-localization of immunosignals in
clusters and with increased intensity in the cytoplasm.
C13* cells exhibited a similar immunoreactive pattern
irrespective of the presence of CDDP, in which the colocalization of p73 and calpain was evident only in the
cytoplasm. Differential co-localization of both proteins
in the two cell lines could be the precursor for the
regulation of p73a by calpain. Changes in p73 localization have already been reported, because interactors of
p73 such as Wwox are able to affect the subcellular
localization of p73, resulting in a change of its apoptotic
effect (Aqeilan et al., 2004). Our results involve calpain
in the subcellular localization of p73.
CDDP differentially effects the intracellular calcium
concentration [Ca2 þ ]i in OVCA cells
As calpain is a calcium-dependent protease, we tested if
CDDP increased [Ca2 þ ]i in both OV2008 and C13* cells
by confocal microscopy. Representative images of
OV2008 cells showed a marked increase in the intensity
of green ﬂuorescence following CDDP treatment; there
was no difference in C13* (Figure 4a). Increases in the
[Ca2 þ ]i were evident around 10 min following the
addition of CDDP to the cultures, plateauing after
50 min, when the experiment was terminated. The
differential inﬂuence of CDDP on [Ca2 þ ]i, calpain
activation and p73a processing in the chemosensitive
and chemoresistant cells suggest that these pathways
regulate OVCA cell sensitivity to CDDP.
The inability of the C13* cells to undergo apoptosis in
response to CDDP was related to the observed
dysregulation of CDDP-induced [Ca2 þ ]i, we examined
the inﬂuence of cyclopiazonic acid (CPA; 100 mM)
on [Ca2 þ ]i, calpain activation (illustrated by cleaved
a-fodrin), TAp73a and DNp73a content and apoptosis
in both OV2008 and C13* cells. CPA is a selective Ca2 þ ATPase inhibitor, which depletes the endoplasmic
reticulum (ER) of Ca2 þ (Moncoq et al., 2007). In both
cell lines, CPA signiﬁcantly increased [Ca2 þ ]i (Figure 4b)
and induced calpain activation (evident by cleaved
a-fodrin), as well as TAp73a and DNp73a downregulation and apoptosis (Figure 4c). Glucose-regulated
protein 78 (GRP78) was used as an indicator of ER
stress (Di Sano et al., 2006). Dysregulation is neither at
the level of calpain nor p73, but rather in the [Ca2 þ ]
signaling in response to CDDP treatment as interpreted
from our data. These ﬁndings also suggest that Ca2 þ is
required for calpain activation and subsequent TAp73a
and DNp73a cleavage and apoptosis. As the machinery
of Ca2 þ mobilization was functional in both OVCA cell
lines and that the inability of C13* cells to respond to
CDDP with increased [Ca2 þ ]i might be due to a defect in
the CDDP-induced Ca2 þ signaling, then a compromised
apoptotic response and CDDP resistance would justify
the observations.
CDDP-induced [Ca2 þ ]i increase involves mobilization
of intracellular Ca2 þ stores in chemosensitive cells
Although CDDP increased the [Ca2 þ ]i in OV2008 cells
(Figure 4a), the source (intracellular vs extracellular) for
Oncogene

the Ca2 þ mobilization is unknown. The possible
contribution of extracellular Ca2 þ in the CDDP-induced
[Ca2 þ ]i increase was assessed in both normal Ca2 þ
concentration (0.1 g/l) and in a Ca2 þ -free media.
Removal of extracellular Ca2 þ (for example, Ca2 þ -free
media) had no effect on the CDDP-induced [Ca2 þ ]i
increase, when compared with the response observed
with normal Ca2 þ media (Figure 5a). The CDDPinduced [Ca2 þ ]i increase in this media declined faster
than the regular media that was sustained up to the
termination of the experiment.
To provide further evidence that the CDDP-induced
[Ca2 þ ]i increase is mediated via mobilization of intracellular Ca2 þ stores, internal Ca2 þ stores in OV2008
were ﬁrst depleted by CPA before CDDP treatment.
Figure 5b demonstrates that CDDP failed to increase
the [Ca2 þ ]i after store depletion in both regular and
Ca2 þ -free media: CDDP-induced [Ca2 þ ]i increase is
dependent on these stores. Whereas CDDP did not
enhance CPA-dependent calpain activation and apoptosis in C13* cells, it had a signiﬁcant effect on these
events in OV2008 (Figure 5c). CPA alone could increase
[Ca2 þ ]i, activate calpain and induce apoptosis in C13*,
whereas CDDP could also activate Ca2 þ -independent
pathways to facilitate these responses in OV2008 cells.
Discussion
The current study demonstrates the important role
of Ca2 þ -mediated, calpain activation in the regulation
of p73a function in human ovarian cancer cells, and
provides evidence that the dysregulation of this pathway
may confer resistance to CDDP-induced apoptosis in
these cells. The role of p73 in drug-induced apoptosis in
OVCA cells is poorly understood and the few published
reports have only considered the effect of exogenous p73
on either the activation of down-stream genes and cell
growth or the effect of CDDP on the endogenous level
of p73 (Muscolini et al., 2008; Righetti et al., 2008). We
have shown that TAp73a over-expression signiﬁcantly
enhanced CDDP-induced apoptosis in different OVCA
cell lines, whereas the effect of DNp73a over-expression
was variable.
The role of p73a in drug-induced apoptosis is unclear.
Although it has been demonstrated that TAp73a is antiapoptotic and inhibits drug- and p53-induced apoptosis
(Grob et al., 2001; Vikhanskaya et al., 2001; Nyman
et al., 2005), other studies have indicated that the TAisoform is a crucial mediator in CDDP-induced
apoptosis (Yoshida et al., 2008; Sang et al., 2009). Our
ﬁndings of the effect of TAp73a over-expression on
CDDP-induced apoptosis in OVCA cells are consistent
with a pro-apoptotic effect of TAp73a.
DNp73 is a dominant negative regulator of p53- and
TAp73-mediated apoptosis in certain cancer cells (Grob
et al., 2001; Muller et al., 2005; Million et al., 2006);
however, some reports have shown that DNp73 can
modulate the expression of various genes in a p53independent manner (Kartasheva et al., 2002). Whereas
DNp73b and DNp73g could be active in transactivation

not appear to affect cell growth or alter chemoresistance
nor antagonize the pro-apoptotic function of p53
(Marabese et al., 2005; Sabatino et al., 2007). It is
possible that the action of DNp73a may be cell-speciﬁc:
interacting with additional mediators and resulting
in differential phenotypes. In our system, the varied
response to DNp73a over-expression may have been to

differences in the genetic background between these cells
(that is, Hey cells) and/or the relative importance of the

Figure 5 CDDP-induced [Ca2 þ ]i increase depends upon internal stores. (a) CDDP-induced [Ca2 þ ]i increase was not effected by the
removal of extracellular Ca2 þ (that is, Ca2 þ -free media). OV2008 cells were cultured in both regular and Ca2 þ -free media and the effect
of CDDP on [Ca2 þ ]i were measured. (b) CDDP-induced [Ca2 þ ]i increase was ceased after store depletion by CPA in both the regular
and the Ca2 þ -free media. OV2008 internal stores were depleted by CPA prior to CDDP treatment and changes in [Ca2 þ ]i were assessed.
(c) CDDP enhanced CPA-dependent calpain activation and apoptosis in OV2008, but not C13* cells. OV2008 and C13* cells were
treated with CPA (100 mM; 24 h) and calpain activation, TAp73a and DNp73a content and apoptosis were determined. Images and
ﬁgures present the mean±s.e.m. of three independent experiments (*Po0.05, ***Po0.001).

mRNA but not at the protein level (Supplementary
Figure 3), suggesting a dysregulation at the translational
level. In this case, DNp73a might need the presence of
TAp73a as well as wild-type p53 in A2780cp cells (which
harbor mutant-p53) to enhance CDDP-induced apoptosis. Our ﬁnding of DNp73 over-expression is consistent with a previous report showing that A2780 clones
stably over-expressing DNp73a responded to CDDP
in a manner similar to their parental cells (Sabatino
et al., 2007).
The reasons for the discrepancies of the role of both
TAp73 and DNp73 in drug-induced apoptosis are not
immediately apparent. Whether they are attributed to
differences in experimental conditions including the type
of genotoxic insults (for example, Staurosporine and
Etoposide), cell type or origin, inherent biochemical characteristics of the cells (for example, relative
Oncogene

distribution of p73 isoforms, interaction with other p73
family members (p53 and p63), and selective activation
by the up-stream activators) requires further investigations (Nyman et al., 2005; Holcakova et al., 2008). In
addition, other interactors could modulate the function
of p73, as it has already been described, for example, for
Wwox (Aqeilan et al., 2004) and for the ASPP family
(Bergamaschi et al., 2004; Sullivan and Lu, 2007).
Nonetheless, our results provide new insights into the
role of p73a in CDDP-induced apoptosis in OVCA cells.
Using two pair of OVCA cell lines for the overexpression experiment and speciﬁc cDNA for each
isoform allowed us to differentially assess their effect
on CDDP-induced apoptosis. Furthermore, the present
studies on p73a downregulation provided further
evidence that endogenous p73a is a determinant of the
sensitivity of OV2008 cell to CDDP. Development of

speciﬁc antibodies and/or inhibitors to each isoform
should be helpful to determine the precise role of p73a in
CDDP-induced apoptosis in ovarian cancer cells.
Endogenous 73a could be involved in CDDP-induced
apoptosis in OVCA cells. The p53-responsive genes
PUMA and NOXA could be its down-stream effectors
in the pro-apoptotic function (Melino et al., 2004;
Muller et al., 2006). PUMA expression is also mediated
by CDDP-induced, p53-dependent apoptosis in OVCA
cells (Fraser et al., 2008). Our observations raise the
possibility that CDDP-induced PUMA expression in
OVCA cells is regulated by both p53-dependent and
-independent pathways.
Our ﬁndings are the ﬁrst demonstration that calpain
regulates TAp73a and DNp73a content in the CDDPinduced apoptosis in cancer cells, although calpainmediated cleavage of p73 isoforms at both the N- and
the C-terminus has been demonstrated (Munarriz et al.,
2005). Calpain inhibition by a speciﬁc inhibitor (Calpeptin) and/or by RNA silencing substantiates the
involvement of calpain in the CDDP-induced, TAp73a
and DNp73a processing in OVCA cells. It also demonstrates, for the ﬁrst time, that calpain is required for
CDDP-induced apoptosis in OVCA cells, where its
inhibition decreased OVCA cell sensitivity to CDDP.
The novel ﬁnding that calpain and p73a interact and
co-localize in these cells provided further support for
such involvement.
Although calpain can cleave p73 at both the N- and
the C-terminus, the consensus sites of calpain cleavage
in the p73 sequence are unknown. Heterogeneity of the
p73 isoforms at both termini, where the calpain cleavage
sites are present, was problematic for the construction of
a mutant p73 that lack these functional sites. It is not
known whether calpain-mediated cleavage would result
in p73a degradation, as in the case of Xiap (Kobayashi
et al., 2002) or enhanced Bax function (Toyota et al.,
2003). The occurrence of calpain-mediated p73a cleavage in chemosensitive, and not in the chemoresistant
cells, is consistent with our concept that p73a cleavage
and activity is involved in the regulation of chemosensitivity. This hypothesis is further supported by the
demonstrated role of TAp73a as a pro-apoptotic protein
in CDDP-induced apoptosis.
Ca2 þ homeostasis is critical for regulation of cellular
function. We found that CDDP induces [Ca2 þ ]i increase in
OV2008, but not in C13* cells. Although a recent study
showed that CDDP increased [Ca2 þ ]i in chemosensitive
HeLa cells, but not in chemoresistant osteosarcoma (U2OS) cells (Splettstoesser et al., 2007), whether the difference
in response was cell-origin speciﬁc or due to inherent
differences in the mechanism of CDDP resistance could
not be determined, as the two cell lines were unrelated. We
were able to conﬁrm such differences by employing
isogenic cell lines pairs. Using both calcium-free media
and depleting the internal stores by CPA, we demonstrated
that the increase in [Ca2 þ ]i by CDDP is dependent on the
internal stores and the deregulation of these stores might
confer CDDP resistance.
The present study demonstrated a novel role of Ca2 þ mediated, calpain activation in regulating p73a function

in CDDP-induced apoptosis in human ovarian cancer.
We observed that CDDP increases [Ca2 þ ]i, induces
activation of calpain, and causes apparent calpainmediated cleavage of p73a. However, the biological
relevance of cleaved p73a remains unclear. One possibility that that cleaved p73a may have a role in the
nucleus, as we observed decreased CDDP-induced
PUMA and NOXA expression that was not secondary
to changes in p53 function. Whether p73a inﬂuences
nuclear function in response to CDDP—perhaps by
translocation into the nucleus itself—remains unknown,
and our laboratory is currently investigating this and
other hypotheses. A greater understanding of the
cellular and molecular mechanisms of chemoresistance
may offer new strategies for the treatment of chemoresistant ovarian cancer and direct further research.

OVCA cells were cultured in DMEM-F12 medium supplemented with fetal bovine serum (10%), streptomycin (50 g/ml),
penicillin (50 U/ml), fungizone (0.625 g/ml; Life Technologies,
Inc., BRL, Carlsbad, CA, USA), and non-essential amino
acids (1%).
Protein extraction and western blotting
Protein extraction and western blotting were performed as
described (Abedini et al., 2008; Fraser et al., 2008). Membranes were incubated overnight at 4 1C with primary
antibodies, and detected with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat IgG raised against the corresponding species.
Peroxidase activity was visualized with an enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) kit. Signal intensity was determined
densitometrically using Scion Image software, version 4.02,
from Scion Corporation (Frederick, MD, USA).
Transient transfection
All cells (2.4  105) were transfected with 2 mg of pcDNA3.1/
CT-GFP vector alone, or pcDNA3.1/CT vectors containing
TAp73a or DNp73a cDNA (Fraser et al., 2008). Cells were
treated with CDDP (10 mM; 24 h) or DMSO (vehicle) and then
harvested for further analysis.
Adenovirus infection
OV2008 cells were infected with adenoviral Xiap-sense or
LacZ control (5 MOI), treated with CDDP and harvested as
reported (Fraser et al., 2003b).
siRNA transfection
OV2008 cells (2.4  105/well) were transfected with siRNA
(Abedini et al., 2008). Brieﬂy, cells were transfected (48 h) with
scrambled sequence siRNA (control) and/or p73a or calpain
siRNA. Cells were treated with CDDP and harvested as above.
Determination of apoptosis
Apoptosis was assessed morphologically by Hoechst 33258 dye
(6.25 ng/ml). At least 400 cells/treatment groups were counted.
Selected ﬁelds and blinded slides were determined randomly to
avoid experimental bias (Fraser et al., 2008).

Assessment of protein interactions
P73a in whole cell lysate was immunoprecipitated with goat
anti-p73 (C-17, 2 mg), as reported (Fraser et al., 2008) and its
interaction with calpain was detected by western blot.
Immunocytochemistry
The p73a and calpain co-localization was determined by
immunocytochemistry (Abedini et al., 2010). Brieﬂy, ﬁxed cells
were incubated with goat anti-p73a (1:25) and mouse anticalpain (1:50) antibodies, subsequently, with donkey anti-goat
Cy5-(p73a; 1:100) and anti-mouse FITC-conjugated (calpain;
1:200) antibodies. Florescence images were acquired with an
LSM 510 confocal laser scanning microscope (Zeiss, Jena,
Germany) and a 63  oil-immersion objective. The images were
merged using Adobe Photoshop 7.01 (Adobe, San Jose, CA, USA).
Calcium measurement
OV2008 and C13* cells loaded with the calcium sensitive
Fluo4-AM dye (5 mM; 30 min; 37 1C) were washed with media
and changes in [Ca2 þ ]i were observed with a Zeiss 510 laser
scanning microscope (Gunes et al., 2009). For CDDP
experiments, each scan lasted for 2 s in duration, every 30 s
for a time period of 1 h. The CPA, images were taken every 15 s
for a 20-min period. Cells were excited at 488 nm and the
emission was captured at 510 nm using LSM 510 software
(Zeiss). Stacks of images were then loaded into ImageJ (http://
rsbweb.nih.gov/ij/) for automated analysis. All experiments
were performed at room temperature in a constant ﬂow of
media (B1 ml/min).
Statistical analysis
Results are expressed as the mean±s.e.m. of at least three
independent experiments and analyzed by two- or three-way
ANOVA using PRISM (Version 3.0 GraphPad, San Diego,
CA, USA) and Sigma STAT (Version 3.1, Aspire Software
International, Ashburn, VA, USA) software program, respectively. Differences between multiple experimental groups were
determined by the Bonferroni test. Statistical signiﬁcance was
indicated at ***Po0.001, **Po0.05 and *Po0.01.

Conﬂict of Interest
Reverse transcriptase polymerase–chain reaction (RT–PCR)
RT–PCR was carried out as previously described (Fraser et al.,
2008). PCR primers from Invitrogen (Burlington, ON,
Canada) were as follows: TAp73a sense (50 -GATTCCAGCA
TGGACGTCTT-30 ), TAp73a antisense (50 -TTCTTCAAGAG
CGGGGAGTA-30 ); DNp73a sense (50 -AAGCGAAAATGCC

TGGCTGACT-30 ); b-actin sense (50 -GGACTTCGAGCAAG
AGATGG-30 ), b-actin antisense (50 -CACCTTCACCGTTCC
AGTTT-30 ). PCR conditions underwent activation (15 min;
95 1C), denaturation (45 s; 94 1C), annealing (TAp73a and
DNp73a; 30 s; 52 1C, b-actin; 45 s; 54 1C) and extension (72 1C;
30 s) for 40 and 25 cycles for p73a and b-actin, respectively.
