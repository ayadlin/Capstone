melanoma (2–4). We previously reported that activation of Rap1, a
member of the Ras family of small GTPases, promotes melanoma cell
proliferation and migration through the mitogen-activated protein
kinase (MAPK) pathway and integrin activation, highlighting an
oncogenic role of Rap1 in melanoma (5). Like other small GTPases,
Rap1 functions as a molecular switch cycling between an active GTPbound form and an inactive GDP-bound form. Rap1 is turned on by
guanine-nucleotide-exchange factors (GEF), which replace GDP for
GTP, and cycled off by GTPase-activating proteins (GAP), which
accelerate the ability of Rap1 to hydrolyze GTP into GDP (6).
Rap1GAP belongs to a family of proteins with GAP function specific
for Rap1/2, which also includes Rap1GAP2, SPA-1, and E6TP1.
Recent evidence supports a role for Rap1GAPs in oncogenesis.
Down-regulation of E6TP1 contributes to the development of
cervical cancer associated with chronic human papillomavirus
infection (7, 8). Deficiency of murine SPA-1, selectively expressed in
lymphoid tissues (9), results in the development of chronic
myeloproliferative or myelodysplastic disease (10). In addition,
tuberin, the product of the tuberous sclerosis type 2 gene that shares
sequence homology with Rap1GAP, functions to stimulate Rap1GTPase activity (11, 12), and its reduced expression is associated with
the development of human gliomas (13, 14).
The Rap1GAP gene is located at chromosome 1p36.1-p35, a locus
where deletions or mutations have been identified in many
malignant tumors, including melanoma, (15, 16) and, more
recently, breast cancer (17). Loss of heterozygosity (LOH) of the
Rap1GAP gene was recently reported in pancreatic cancer (18), and
decreased expression has been identified in thyroid cancer (19, 20)
and oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (21). In these studies,
the loss of Rap1GAP expression was associated with tumor cell
proliferation and migration and tumor growth, leading to the
proposal that Rap1GAP may function as a tumor suppressor gene
in these tumors.
Loss of function of tumor suppressor genes is a common theme
in tumorigenesis. The transcription of tumor suppressor genes can
be silenced by gene mutations, LOH, or epigenetic mechanisms,
including gene promoter methylation (22–24). Promoter methylation, catalyzed by DNA methyltransferases, occurs via covalent
modification of cytosines and typically affects CpG-rich areas
known as CpG islands located in the promoter region of many
genes (24) and has been identified to play an important role in
carcinogenesis (25–27). Approximately 50 genes that are silenced
by promoter hypermethylation in melanoma have been identified
(28), including methylthioadenosin phosphorylase (25), PTEN (26),
and Apaf-1 (27). Furthermore, DAB2IP, a GAP specific for Ras (29),
and DLC-1, a Rho family member GAP (30), is down-regulated in
certain human tumors via aberrant promoter methylation.

Abstract
Melanoma is the most serious, highly aggressive form of skin
cancer with recent dramatic increases in incidence. Current
therapies are relatively ineffective, highlighting the need for
a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms
contributing to the disease. We have previously shown that
activation of Rap1 promotes melanoma cell proliferation and
migration through the mitogen-activated protein kinase
pathway and integrin activation. In the present study, we
show that expression of Rap1GAP, a specific negative
regulator of Rap1, is decreased in human melanoma tumors
and cell lines. Overexpression of Rap1GAP in melanoma cells
blocks Rap1 activation and extracellular signal-regulated
kinase (ERK) phosphorylation and inhibits melanoma cell
proliferation and survival. In addition, overexpression of
Rap1GAP also inhibits focal adhesion formation and
decreases melanoma cell migration. Rap1GAP down-regulation is due to its promoter methylation, a mechanism of gene
silencing in tumors. Furthermore, treatment of melanoma
cells with the demethylating agent 5-aza-2’-deoxycytidine
reinduces Rap1GAP expression, followed by decreased Rap1
activity, ERK phosphorylation, and cell proliferation and
survival—changes that are significantly blunted in cells
transfected by small interfering RNA–mediated Rap1GAP
knockdown. Taken together, our findings indicate that downregulation of Rap1GAP via promoter hypermethylation
promotes melanoma cell proliferation, survival, and migration. [Cancer Res 2009;69(2):449–57]

Introduction
Melanoma is the most serious, highly aggressive form of skin
cancer whose incidence has increased at a rate greater than that of
any other cancer type in the United States.5 Recently, targeted
melanoma therapies have been developed based upon molecular
insights into tumor pathogenesis (such as receptor kinase
inhibitors) but have shown relative ineffectiveness to date when
used as a monotherapy (1). The lack of therapeutic response to
currently available treatment highlights the importance of
improved understanding of the complex molecular mechanism(s)
that contribute to melanoma development.
The RAS/BRAF/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathway plays a central role in the development of most types of

containing 20 CpG sites, and methylation-specific PCR (MSP) was
performed. Details, including primer sets, can be found in Supplementary
Materials and Methods.
DNA demethylation. Experimental details can be found in Supplementary Materials and Methods. 5-Aza, a demethylating agent, was used in the
present study.
Quantitative DNA methylation analysis. Genomic DNA extraction and
DNA bisulfite modification were performed. Sequenom technology
(Sequenom) was used for quantitative Rap1GAP gene methylation at a
core facility at our institution.6 Three pairs of primers for three CpG islands
identified in the Rap1GAP promoter were designed using Epidesigner
software (Sequenom) and included the CpG islands that were initially
examined by MSP. Further experimental details, including primer sets and
methylation analyses, can be found in Supplementary Materials and

Genomic DNA or total RNA was extracted from melanoma cell lines and

Statistical analysis. Statistical analysis was performed using Student’s t
test. For comparisons between multiple treatments, significance was
determined using Bonferroni’s post hoc ANOVA test where appropriate.
All values were represented as mean F SD. Significance was determined at
P < 0.05.

Here, we report that the expression of Rap1GAP is decreased in
human melanoma tumors and cell lines. Overexpression of
Rap1GAP in melanoma cells blocks Rap1 activation and ERK
phosphorylation and inhibits melanoma cell proliferation and
survival. In addition, overexpression of Rap1GAP inhibits focal
adhesion formation and decreases melanoma cell migration. We
show that Rap1GAP was down-regulated in melanoma via
promoter methylation. Furthermore, treatment of melanoma cells
having low constitutive Rap1GAP expression with the demethylating agent 5-aza-2’-deoxycytidine (5-aza) results in reinduction of
Rap1GAP expression and decreases Rap1 activity, ERK phosphorylation, and cell proliferation and survival. These effects are
blunted in small interfering RNA (siRNA)–mediated Rap1GAP
knockdown melanoma cells, confirming the specificity of the
effects. Our findings contribute to further understanding of the
molecular mechanisms underlying melanoma development and
may lend further support to the exploration of treatment targeting
epigenetic gene regulation in melanoma.

Materials and Methods
Melanoma cell lines and human tumors. Fresh frozen and formalinfixed, paraffin-embedded human melanoma tumors and human melanoma
cell lines (A375, MeWo, A2058, 501 mel, LOX, M14, DM6, DM 13, Sk mel 5,
DM14, and LH) were used in accordance with an approved institutional
protocol (HRPO 05-0794). Detailed descriptions can be found in Supplementary Materials and Methods.
Cell transfections. Melanoma cell tranfections were carried out with
either a pcDNA3.1 vector containing Flag-Rap1GAP (generous gift of Dr. P.
Stork, Oregon Health Sciences University) or Rap1GAPsiRNA (Santa Cruz
Biotechnology) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Experimental
details are listed in Supplementary Materials and Methods.
Western blot and Rap1 activation assays. Western blot analyses and
Rap1 activation assays using cell protein lysates were performed, as
described previously (5). Further experimental details, including specific
antibodies, are described in Supplementary Materials and Methods.
Reverse transcription-PCR. Total RNA was isolated from melanoma
cells using RNA STAT-60 (Tel-Test, Inc.) and quantified by spectrophotometry (Eppendorf). Primer sets and PCR conditions are listed in Supplementary Materials and Methods.
Real-time PCR. Total RNA was isolated from melanoma cell lines, as
described above. cDNA was synthesized by SuperScript First-Strand
Synthesis System for reverse transcription–PCR (RT-PCR) from Invitrogen.
Primer sets, PCR conditions, and details of quantitation analysis are listed
in Supplementary Materials and Methods.
Immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence. Formalin-fixed,
paraffin-embedded melanoma tumors, and benign nevi were sectioned
(5 Am), dehydrated, and immunohistochemistry for Rap1GAP was
performed using primary and secondary antibodies, as listed in Supplementary Materials and Methods. For immunofluorescence, cells were fixed
in 4% paraformadyhyde for 30 min and permealized with 0.1% Triton X-100,
and immunostaining was performed with antibodies, as listed in
Supplementary Materials and Methods.
Cell proliferation and apoptosis assays. BrdUrd incorporation was
used to determine cell proliferation. Cell apoptosis was detected by
terminal deoxyribonucleotydyl transferase–mediated dUTP nick-end labeling assay. Experimental details can be found in Supplementary Materials
and Methods.

pore size transwell inserts (Corning Costar), and cell migration into the
bottom of the serum-containing well was assessed at 24 h, as previously
described (5).

Results
Decreased Rap1GAP expression in melanoma tumors and
cell lines. To characterize the role of Rap1GAP in melanoma
tumorigenesis, we first examined its expression in human
melanoma tumors and cell lines. Rap1GAP expression and Rap1
activity in eight human melanoma tumors were determined by
Western analysis and Rap1 activation pull-down assay, respectively. Decreased or absent Rap1GAP expression was found in
cutaneous (15138 and 33221) and metastatic (14583, 16151, 11771,
13488, and 14150) melanoma tumors compared with human
epidermal melanocytes (HEM; Fig. 1A). An increased level of
Rap1GTP was associated with decreased Rap1GAP expression in
the majority of tumors, consistent with negative regulation of
Rap1 activity by Rap1GAP. In addition, decreased Rap1GAP
expression was found in tumors that were either wild-type BRAF
or BRAFV600E. All tumors examined were wild type for NRAS. We
found no association between decreased Rap1GAP expression and
the BRAF and NRAS mutations (Fig. 1A). Interestingly, tumor
19480 had higher levels of Rap1GTP in spite of high Rap1GAP
expression. We therefore examined whether this tumor harbored
Rap1GAP mutations, as recently identified in two human breast
cancers (17). We had previously sequenced the entire Rap1GAP
gene (21 exons) in seven human melanoma tumors and in two
melanoma cell lines (A375 and MeWo) and had been unable to
identify significant mutations.7 Similarly, we were unable to
identify mutations 769T>G, 1826A>G in tumor 19480 at the two
sites identified in breast cancer (data not shown). The mechanism
of this dissociation of Rap1GAP expression and Rap1 activity
needs to be further identified.
Rap1GAP expression was determined in formalin-fixed, paraffinembedded melanoma tumors (n = 11) and nevi (n = 8) by
immunohistochemistry. Five samples were paired malignant
(melanoma) and benign (melanocytic nevi) from the same patient.

expression. Taken together, our findings of down-regulation of
Rap1GAP in a high percentage of both the melanoma tumors and
the cell lines investigated indicate a role for Rap1GAP in melanoma
tumorigenesis.
Rap1GAP blocks ERK phosphorylation, inhibits melanoma
cell proliferation and survival, and is associated with
decreased Rap1 activity. We had previously found that Rap1
promotes melanoma cell proliferation and ERK activation, an effect
that was blunted by dominant-negative Rap1A or Rap1 siRNA (5).
Because Rap1GAP inhibits Rap1 activity, we asked whether
Rap1GAP expression affects ERK activity and melanoma cell
proliferation. Two melanoma cell lines with low or nondetectable
Rap1GAP expression and high-baseline Rap1 activity (LH and
Skmel 5) were chosen for further experiments. We wanted to assure
that the constitutively high Rap1 activity in these two cell lines was
not due to activating mutations in Rap1 (32). Direct sequencing of
cDNA for Rap1A and Rap1B was performed. No mutations were
found in either cell line (data not shown). We then proceeded to
overexpress Rap1GAP in these cells by transfection with FLAGtagged Rap1GAP. Consistent with its GAP function, Rap1GAP
overexpression also greatly reduced Rap1GTP level, which in turn
decreased ERK phosphorylation (Fig. 2B) and inhibited cell
proliferation by nearly 50% compared with empty vector-transfected control cells (Fig. 2C). Rap1GAP overexpression also
significantly induced apoptosis (Fig. 2D). These data show that
increased Rap1GAP expression suppresses Rap1 activity, as well as
ERK activation and melanoma cell proliferation and survival.
Rap1GAP suppresses focal adhesion formation and cell
migration. Rap1 regulates integrin activation, focal adhesion
formation, and cell polarization (33). Phosphorylation of Src, a
nonreceptor tyrosine kinase that is autophosphorylated and
activated upon engagement of avh3 integrin to vitronectin (34),
is a surrogate marker for increased avh3 activation. Overexpression
of Rap1GAP decreased basal Src phosphorylation in LH melanoma
cells and blocked serum-induced Src phosphorylation (Fig. 3A).
We then investigated the effect of Rap1GAP on two integrindependent events, focal adhesion formation, and filamentous actin
(F-actin) assembly. Serum-starved empty vector and Rap1GAPtransfected LH cells were stimulated with serum for 1 hour and
stained for F-actin and vinculin. After serum stimulation, empty
vector-transfected cells spread, and vinculin was translocated from
the cytoplasm to the focal adhesions at the leading edge of the cell
membrane (Fig. 3B, top left). F-actin was organized into numerous
filaments oriented parallel to the long axes of the cells (Fig. 3B, top
middle). In contrast, Rap1GAP-overexpressing cells remained in a
rounded morphology, and F-actin and vinculin were localized to
the cytoplasm after serum stimulation (Fig. 3B, bottom).
The formation of focal adhesions is required for cell migration
(33–35). We then determined the effect of overexpression of
Rap1GAP on melanoma cell migration. Serum-stimulated Rap1GAP-overexpressing LH cells exhibited decreased cell migration
compared with empty vector control cells (P < 0.05; Fig. 3C and D).
These findings, taken together with the effect of Rap1GAP
overexpression on Src phosphorylation, focal adhesion formation,
and F-actin filament formation, provide functional data to support
our proposal that loss of Rap1GAP expression promotes processes
that may favor tumor growth and metastasis.
Down-regulation of Rap1GAP is mediated by its promoter
methylation. The expression of tumor suppressor genes may be
silenced through gene mutations, LOH, or epigenetic mechanisms,
including gene promoter hypermethylation (22–24). We have been

Figure 1. Decreased Rap1GAP protein expression in human melanoma
tumors. A, protein was harvested from eight human melanoma tissues and
HEMs and subjected to Western blot for Rap1GAP and pull-down assay for Rap1
activity. h-Actin served as internal control. DNA extracted from the same eight
tumors and HEMs was sequenced for BRAF (exons 11 and 15) and NRAS
(exons 2 and 3). The mutational status is listed under each sample,
correspondingly. B, immunostaining for Rap1GAP was performed in human
malignant melanoma and benign nevi. Top, left and right, positive staining (red)
for Rap1GAP in the cytoplasm of nevus cells and upper epidermis. Middle,
absence of Rap1GAP staining in human melanoma tumor cells with positive
epidermal staining. Bottom, slides without primary antibody serve as negative
control. Magnifications, 40 (left ) and 200 (right ).

High expression of Rap1GAP protein in the suprabasal epidermis
served as positive internal control (Fig. 1B). In seven of eight nevi,
Rap1GAP was expressed in the cytoplasm of dermal nevus cells
(Fig. 1B, top). In contrast, in all of the melanoma tumors examined
(n = 11), Rap1GAP was not detected in the tumor cells (Fig. 1B,
middle). These results showed decreased Rap1GAP expression in
melanoma but not in benign nevi.
Next, Rap1GAP level in 11 melanoma cell lines was determined
by Western blot. Eight of 11 cell lines had decreased or absent
Rap1GAP expression compared with HEM (Fig. 2A). Again, there
was no correlation between BRAF/NRAS mutations and Rap1GAP

melanoma cell lines using Epityper software (Sequenom). Human
melanoma samples that showed either promoter hypermethylation
(14150) or hypomethylation (19480) by MSP (Fig. 4A) were
examined along with three melanoma cell lines (LOX, LH, and
A375) pre–5-aza treatment and post–5-aza treatment. Results are
reported as the relative methylation of each CpG unit expressed as
a ratio of methylated/unmethylated (range, 0–1) for all evaluated
islands (36). Relative methylation of each CpG unit (each CpG unit
is composed of one or several CpG sites, which collectively
constitute a CpG island) in three CpG islands is shown in tabulated
form in Supplementary Table S1. Sequenom mass signal for
methylation was sufficient to evaluate 84% of the CpG units within
CpG island 1, 86% of the CpG units within island 2, and 86% of the
CpG units in island 3 in tumor 14150 and LOX, A375, and LH cells.
Mass signal was too low to quantitate the methylation of CpG
island 3 in HEM, tumor 19480, and 5-aza–treated melanoma cells.
In melanoma tumor 14150, relative methylation for all three CpG
islands was >0.7 and significantly increased compared with HEM in
CpG islands 1 and 2 (Supplementary Table S1; Fig. 1A and B). In
tumor 19480, relative CpG methylation was <0.07 for both CpG
islands 1 and 2. There was no significant difference for these two
CpG islands between tumor 19480 and HEM (Supplementary Table

unable to identify significant Rap1GAP gene mutations in human
melanoma tumors and cell lines in our earlier investigations.8 We,
thus, focused on other potential mechanisms of Rap1GAP downregulation, in particular, epigenetic gene silencing via promoter
hypermethylation. We initially used methylation-specific PCR for
Rap1GAP to detect the methylation status of the Rap1GAP
promoter in both human melanoma tumors and cell lines. As
shown in Fig. 4A and B, Rap1GAP promoter methylation was found
in four of the melanoma tumors (14583, 11771, 15138, 14150) and in
A375, LOX, M14, DM14, DM13, LH, SK mel5 melanoma cell lines

Western blot (Figs. 1A and 2A).
We next wanted to determine whether the demethylating agent
5-aza was effective in demethylating the Rap1GAP promoter in
melanoma cells (LOX, A375, and LH). In fact, 5-aza treatment of all
three cell lines resulted in demethylation of the Rap1GAP promoter
compared with 5-aza–untreated cells (Fig. 4C). To further confirm
Rap1GAP promoter methylation and the effect of 5-aza, we
analyzed the degree of methylation of three CpG islands within

In all three melanoma cell lines, there was a significant increase
in the level of relative methylation of the CpG units in CpG islands
1 and 2 compared with HEM, and 5-aza reversed this methylation
(Supplementary Table S1; Fig. 1C and D). The average methylation
level of CpG island 3 was >0.7 in control LOX, A375, and LH cells.
Data for post 5-aza–treated cells and HEM were not available due
to low mass signal (Supplementary Table S1). Taken together,
melanoma cell lines not only showed higher levels of methylation
of three CpG islands within the Rap1GAP promoter region
compared with HEM but the relative methylation of the Rap1GAP
promoter was essentially reversed by 5-aza in these three
melanoma cell lines, respectively (Fig. 4D, right). These results

were again consistent with the results of MSP and extended our
findings to provide a more extensive, quantitative measure of
Rap1GAP promoter methylation (37).
5-Aza reinduction of expression of Rap1GAP suppresses
melanoma cell proliferation and survival. We tested whether 5aza treatment restores Rap1GAP expression in three melanoma cell
lines. Indeed, 5-aza treatment reinduced expression of Rap1GAP
mRNA in LOX cells in a time-dependent manner (Supplementary
Fig. S2) and reinduced expression of Rap1GAP mRNA in A375 and
LH cells compared with controls (Fig. 5A). This was confirmed by
real-time PCR, which showed >200-fold increases in Rap1GAP
mRNA expression in 5-aza–treated LOX, A375, and LH melanoma
cells compared with untreated controls (Supplementary Table S2).

dehydrogenase (94 bp; Supplementary Fig. S3)]. We then investigated whether 5-aza reinduction of Rap1GAP expression could
reproduce the downstream effects of Rap1GAP overexpression that
we found after Rap1GAP transfection. In fact, after 5-aza treatment,
Rap1GAP protein reinduction was associated with decreased Rap1
activity, ERK phosphorylation (Fig. 5B), cell proliferation (Fig. 5C),
and increased apoptosis (Fig. 5D) compared with untreated
controls.
To confirm the specificity of Rap1GAP induction by 5-aza, we
used siRNA to specifically knockdown Rap1GAP. As shown in Fig.
6A, Rap1GAP siRNA transfection significantly decreased Rap1GAP
mRNA reinduction in LOX cells after 5-aza treatment compared
with 5-aza–treated cells with or without control siRNA transfection. More importantly, 5-aza reinduction of Rap1GAP protein
expression was blunted, concomitant with increases in Rap1
activity and ERK phosphorylation in LOX cells transfected with
Rap1GAP siRNA compared with control siRNA-transfected, 5-aza–
treated cells (Fig. 6B). As a result, 5-aza inhibition of cell

Discussion
The majority (f85%) of melanomas harbor activating mutations
in either BRAF or NRAS, acting upstream of ERK/MAPK pathway.
Either mutation alone, however, seems insufficient for melanoma
development, and f15% to 20% of melanomas do not harbor
mutations in either gene. To this point, it has been shown that
inhibition of ERK activity alone does not correlate with inhibition
of melanoma cell growth (38). It has also been determined that
acral, mucosal, and subungual melanomas uncommonly carry
BRAF and NRAS mutations and may have mutations in other
oncogenic genes, such as kit (39). Recently, through a systematic
interrogation of melanoma cell lines lacking mutations in either of
these two genes, a molecular distinct subset was identified
characterized by p53 inactivation, reduced ERK activity, and
increased expression of epithelial cell markers (40). Reports, such
as these, highlight the genetic heterogeneity of melanoma (2, 3) and
support the contribution of additional molecular events, acting
either through the ERK/MAPK pathway or distinct from it, to
melanoma tumorigenesis.
In this study, we have shown that Rap1GAP regulates processes
important in melanoma tumorigenesis and show an epigenetic
mechanism of Rap1GAP regulation. More specifically, Rap1GAP
expression was down-regulated in most melanoma tumors and cell
lines examined, and immunohistochemical analysis showed that

down-regulation may be cell type–specific. For instance, treatment
of pancreatic cancer cell lines with absent Rap1GAP expression
with the DNA methyltransferase inhibitor 5-aza failed to induce
Rap1GAP expression. However, lack of Rap1GAP expression
correlated well with LOH status of the Rap1GAP gene (18). In
addition, recent mutations in the Rap1GAP gene have been
identified in two breast cancers (17), although we have been
unable to identify similar mutations in the melanoma tumors or
cell lines examined. We did, however, detect a high frequency of
promoter methylation in the Rap1GAP gene, supporting a role for
promoter hypermethylation in Rap1GAP down-regulation in
melanoma. Furthermore, 5-aza treatment reinduced Rap1GAP
expression in several melanoma cell lines, with consequent
decreased Rap1 activity, ERK phosphorylation, and inhibition of
melanoma cell proliferation and survival. The specificity of 5-aza–
induced demethylation on Rap1GAP was shown using Rap1GAP
siRNA-transfected cells, where 5-aza–reinduced Rap1GAP expression was blunted together with increased Rap1 activity, ERK
phosphorylation, and cell proliferation. Taken together, these
findings highlight the role of the Rap1GAP/Rap1 pathway in
processes important to melanoma tumorogenesis.
Several studies have shown that, dependent upon the cell and
tissue type, Rap1 can either induce or inhibit ERK activation (6, 45).
Early work found that Ras, as opposed to Rap1, mediated the
activation of ERK in melanocytes and B16 murine melanoma cells
(46). Activated Rap1 can associate with BRAF, forming a complex
that activates ERK in certain cells (47). In addition, distinct cellular
pools of Rap1 exist, and the potential to form a Rap1/BRAF
complex leading to activation of ERK is dependent on the
capability of distinct Rap1-GEFs to redirect Rap1 to the plasma
membrane (48).

Rap1GAP is expressed in the cytoplasm of benign nevus cells but
not in malignant melanoma cells. Second, overexpression of
Rap1GAP in human melanoma cell lines that have very low or
absent Rap1GAP expression have greatly reduced Rap1GTP levels
and diminished to absent ERK phosphorylation. Third, Rap1GAP
inhibits melanoma cell proliferation, survival, focal adhesion
formation, and migration. We also report that the mechanism of
Rap1GAP decreased expression is via promoter methylation in a
significant number of melanoma tumors and cell lines. Finally, we
show the specificity of the demethylating agent 5-aza in
reinduction of Rap1GAP expression in melanoma cell lines using
siRNA specific to Rap1GAP.
Rap1GAP is located on chromosome 1p35-36, a locus frequently
implicated as a putative tumor suppressor gene in several cancer
types, including chronic myelocytic leukemia (41), gliomas (42),
and oral squamous carcinoma (15) via mechanisms including LOH
and chromosomal deletion. Until recently, the identification of a
specific tumor suppressor gene residing at this site has remained
elusive. Using murine models engineered for gain and loss of a
region corresponding to human 1p36, CHD5 was identified as
having tumor suppressor activity (43). LOH studies in melanoma
have found 1p36 allelic loss in a significant number of melanoma
tumors (44) and may represent another gene in addition to CHD5.
The role of other Rap1 GAP family members in tumor
development has been reported, including tuberin in tuberous
sclerosis (11–14), E6TP1 in cervical cancer (7, 8), and SPA-1 in
murine myelodysplastic syndrome (9, 10). More specifically, a
tumor suppressor role for Rap1GAP has been recently reported in
pancreatic cancer (18), thyroid cancer (19, 20), and oropharyngeal
squamous cell carcinoma (21). Although Rap1GAP expression is
decreased in all of these tumors, the mechanism(s) of Rap1GAP

effect of Rap1GAP expression on melanoma cell invasion, tumor
growth, angiogenesis, and metastasis are currently under way in
our laboratory.
In addition, the squamous cell carcinoma study showed that
Rap1GAP expression suppressed tumor growth and increased
invasive capability, and matrix metalloproteinase activity in vivo
was associated with early (low-N stage) squamous cell carcinoma
(49). In our studies, the primary human melanoma tumors
examined by immunohistochemistry did not express Rap1GAP
protein, in contrast to their benign counterparts (melanocytic
nevi). In addition, the majority of both the cutaneous and
metastatic tumors that we examined by Western blot had
decreased to absent Rap1GAP expression. Interestingly, the
findings in squamous cell carcinomas were dependent upon tumor
stage, and we do not have clinical correlation or patient follow-up
for the melanoma tumors that we investigated. Determination of
whether a correlation between Rap1GAP expression and pathologic
or clinical stage in melanoma will obviously require further study.
Taken together, our findings support a role for Rap1GAP in the
regulation of processes important to melanoma tumor formation
and progression and show the role of promoter methylation in the
regulation of gene expression. These data may contribute to the
further understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying
melanoma development and may have implications for melanoma
treatment. Our findings may also lend further support to the
exploration of treatments targeting epigenetic gene regulation in
melanoma.

In the present study, we found that decreased Rap1GAP
expression in melanoma tumors and cell lines with increased
Rap1 activity did not correlate with either BRAF or NRAS
mutational status. Moreover, in both LH and Skmel 5 melanoma
cells having very low or absent Rap1GAP expression but distinct
BRAF and NRAS gene mutational status, overexpression of
Rap1GAP inhibited ERK phosphorylation and cell proliferation
and survival. This is consistent with our previous work showing
that inhibition of Rap1 activity using Rap1 siRNAs and dominantnegative Rap1 inhibits ERK phosphorylation and melanoma cell
growth independent of BRAF and NRAS mutation status (5). Based
upon these findings, we propose that the Rap1GAP/Rap1/ERK
pathway may function either in a synergistic manner or
independent from the RAS/RAF/ERK pathway in melanoma
tumorigenesis.
In squamous cell carcinoma, Rap1GAP expression was found to
decrease activation of Rap1 and ERK and inhibit tumor growth
(21), consistent with our findings. Seemingly conflicting cell type–
specific findings, however, have been reported with respect to the
effect of Rap1GAP expression on cell migration and invasion. For
example, Rap1GAP expression in squamous cell carcinomas
induced metalloproteinase expression (MMP-2 and MMP-9) and
increased cell invasion (49), whereas antisense oligonucleotides to
Rap1GAP had no effect on ovarian cancer cell migration through
Matrigel (50). We had found that Rap1 activation increases
activation of avh3 integrin and promotes cell migration in
melanoma cells (5). In the present study, we show that overexpression of Rap1GAP in melanoma cells with low to absent
Rap1GAP expression blocks serum-induced cell spreading, focal
adhesion formation, F-actin cytoskeletal arrangement, and integrin
activation—processes integral to cell migration (34, 35). In fact, we
show that Rap1GAP overexpression does inhibit melanoma cell
migration, consistent with findings in pancreatic (18) and thyroid
(20) carcinoma, wherein overexpression of Rap1GAP not only
inhibited tumor cell growth but also suppressed tumor cell
invasion and migration. Again, we propose that these effects are
cell type–specific and tumor type–specific. Further studies using
in vitro assays and murine xenograft models to investigate the
