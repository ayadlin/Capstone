ABSTRACT
The tumor suppressor protein p53 is unstable in quiescent cells and undergoes
proteosomal degradation. Under conditions of cellular stress, p53 is rapidly stabilized
by post-translational modification, thereby escaping degradation and translocating
to the nucleus where it activates genes related to cell cycle arrest or apoptosis.
Here, we report that the transcription elongation factor Ell3 sensitizes luminal typecancer cell line, MCF7, which have wild-type p53, to the chemotherapeutic agent cisdiamminedichloroplatinum(II) (CDDP) by stabilizing p53. Overexpression of Ell3 in
MCF7 cells suppressed the MDM2-mediated ubiquitin-dependent degradation pathway.
In addition, Ell3 promoted binding of p53 to NADH quinone oxidoreductase 1, which is
linked to the ubiquitin-independent degradation of p53. We found that Ell3 activates
interleukin-20 (IL20) expression, which is linked to the ERK1/2 signaling pathway.
Chemical inhibition of ERK1/2 signaling or molecular suppression of IL20 revealed
that the ERK1/2 signaling pathway and IL20 are the main causes of p53 stabilization
in Ell3-overexpressing MCF7 cells. These findings suggest that the ERK1/2 pathway
can be targeted in the rational development of therapies to induce chemosensitization
of breast cancer cells.

is maintained at low levels in unstressed cells through
continuous proteasomal degradation by both ubiquitindependent and ubiquitin-independent processes. While
ubiquitin-dependent degradation of p53 is an active
process, ubiquitin-independent degradation is a passive
process. Unstructured p53 is inherently unstable and
is degraded through the 20S proteasome by default
unless inhibited by NAD(P)H quinone oxidoreductase
1 (NQO1). NQO1 is a flavin-containing quinone reduc­
tase catalyzing the reduction of various quinones using
either NADH or NADPH as a reducing cofactor [4].
p53 is stabilized by binding to NQO1 in an NADHdependent process [5, 6]. In the presence of dicumarol,
curcumin, and several other inhibitors of NQO1 activity,
p53 becomes highly unstable and prone to proteasomal
degradation.

INTRODUCTION
ELL3 belongs to the eleven-nineteen lysinerich leukemia (ELL) family of RNA polymerase II
transcription elongation factors and is enriched in testis.
In mice, Ell3 primes gene activation during embryonic
stem cell (ESC) specification by marking the enhancers
of developmentally regulated genes, thereby establishing
PolII localization [1]. Recently, our laboratory reported
that Ell3 enhances the differentiation of mouse ESCs by
protecting differentiating cells from apoptosis through the
promotion of p53 degradation [2].
p53 plays a central role in oncogenesis by
regulating the cell cycle, DNA repair, and apoptosis.
Most types of human cancers have a mutated p53
pathway, highlighting its role in tumorigenesis [3]. p53

Many chemotherapeutic regimens employed for
the treatment of breast cancer include platinum-based
drugs, in particular cis-diamminedichloroplatinum(II)
(CDDP, best known as cisplatin). The anticancer activity
of CDDP is initiated through its binding to DNA,
causing crosslinking and subsequently generating DNA
lesions. The DNA damage interferes with replication
and activates the DNA damage response and apoptotic
machinery. Despite initial efficacy, CDDP treatment
often results in the development of chemoresistance,
leading to therapeutic failure. Intense research has been
conducted to understand this chemoresistance mechanism
with aim of developing chemosensitization strategies.
It is currently known that CDDP induces MAP kinase
pathways in ovarian carcinoma cell lines [7] . Inhibition of
CDDP-induced ERK1/2 activity by the chemical inhibitor
PD98059 decreases the half-life of p53, which causes the
cells to become chemoresistant [8].
Cytokine interleukin 20 (IL20) is associated with
inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis,
contact hypersensitivity, and atherosclerosis [9]. IL20
induces cellular responses through a type I receptor
composed of IL20R/IL20R2 chains and a type II receptor
consisting of an IL22R1/IL20R2 heterodimer [10, 11].
IL20 transmits its signal through signal transducer and
activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) in keratinocytes [12].
IL20 treatment activates MAPK signaling proteins, such
as ERK1/2, p38 MAPK, and JNK, in human umbilical
vein endothelial cells. IL20 stimulation of GBM8901
glioblastoma cell cultures activates the JAK2/STAT3 and
ERK1/2 pathways [13, 14]. IL20 promotes migration and
invasion of bladder cancer cells through ERK-mediated
MMP-9 protein expression [15], and increases the cell
proliferation and colony formation of oral cancer cells by
activating STAT3 and ERK signaling [16]. Although IL20
is associated with tumor progression through its regulation
of migration and invasion, little is known about its role in
the response of tumor cells to drugs.
In this study, we found that Ell3 sensitized MCF7
cells to CDDP by stabilizing p53 protein. This stabilization
was achieved by suppression of the MDM2-mediated
ubiquitination pathway. Ell3 also increased p53 binding
to NQO1, allowing p53 to avoid the default passive
degradation pathway. Furthermore, we found that Ell3
increased IL20 expression, leading to the activation of the
ERK1/2 signaling pathway. Ell3 up-regulation of IL20 and
ERK signaling is the primary cause of p53 stabilization in
response to CDDP treatment.

a MEK/ERK-dependent signaling pathway [17]. To
extend our understanding of the function of Ell3 in breast
cancer, we used public microarray datasets to analyze the
expression level of the Ell3 gene in 209 resected breast
tumors (GSE2034 [18]) and in 52 human breast cancer cell
lines (GSE41313). In breast tumors, a significantly higher
level of Ell3 expression was observed in luminal than in
basal tumor types (P < 0.0113, Figure 1A, left panel). A
similar expression pattern was observed in breast cancer
cell lines (P < 0.0001, Figure 1a, right panel). To elucidate
the meaning of Ell3 expression in breast cancer cells, we
engineered MCF7 cells to overexpress Ell3 and examined
the response of these cells to CDDP. CDDP treatment of
Ell3-overexpressing MCF7 cells (Ell3-OE) resulted in a
hypersensitive response that induced apoptosis and p53
accumulation (Figure 1B). In contrast, in MDA-MB-231
and Hs578T cells, which have mutated forms of p53, both
control and overexpressing cells showed an apoptotic
response and p53 accumulation when treated with CDDP
(Supplementary Figure S1). To determine if the response
of Ell3-OE to CDDP was induced by Ell3, we examined
the response of stable Ell3-knockdown MCF7 cells (Ell3KD) to CDDP treatment. Contrary to Ell3-OE cells,
the extent of apoptosis in Ell3-KD cells was less than
that in control cells and was accompanied by lower p53
accumulation (Figure 1C). Furthermore, introduction of
p53 siRNA (sip53) decreased CDDP-mediated apoptosis
in Ell-OE cells to a level similar to that of control cells,
indicating that the apoptosis requires a p53-dependent
pathway (Figure 1D). The effect of the expression level
of Ell3 on the apoptotic response of MCF7 cells to CDDP
was confirmed by the MTT assay. Consistent with the
results of the flow cytometric analysis of apoptotic cells,
the MTT assay revealed that Ell3-OE cells are sensitive
to CDDP, whereas Ell3-KD cells are resistant to CDDP,
compared with control cells (Supplementary Figure S2).
Pretreatment with a general caspase inhibitor (z-VADFMK) significantly reduced apoptosis from 43.72% ±
1.23% to 18.45% ± 0.63% (P < 0.01), indicating that Ell3
induces CDDP-mediated apoptosis in MCF7 cells through
caspase activation (Figure 1E). As shown in Figure 1F,
p53 gradually accumulated in Ell3-OE in a time-dependent
manner during CDDP treatment. However, the p53 level
transiently increased in control cells 12 h after CDDP
treatment and then returned to basal levels. In Ell3-KD
cells, consistent with the apoptotic phenotype, the level
of p53 accumulation was lower than that in control cells
after CDDP treatment (Figure 1G). Overexpression of
Ell3 in MCF7 cells also induced p53 accumulation after
CDDP treatment (Figure 1H, Supplementary Figure S3A).
In addition, introduction of siRNA targeting Ell3 in Ell3OE cells resulted in lower p53 accumulation at 24 h
(Figure 1I, Supplementary Figure S3B). These results
indicate that p53 accumulation in MCF7 cells following
CDDP exposure is induced by Ell3 activity. Subcellular
fractionation analysis showed that p53 translocated to

the nucleus following CDDP treatment in Ell3-OE cells
(Figure 1J). Consistent with p53 accumulation in Ell3-OE
cells as early as 6 h after CDDP treatment, the expression
of p53 target genes including NOXA, GADD45A, and
cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1A (p21) increased 6 h
after CDDP treatment, indicating that accumulated p53
was functionally active and able to induce the expression
of target genes (Figure 1K).

an indirect marker of DNA strand breaks and replication
arrest [20], appeared 48 h after CDDP treatment in Ell3OE (Figure 3A). This result suggests that p53 stabilized
and accumulated before DNA was damaged by CDDP in
Ell3-OE cells. Since p53 and MDM2 formed a complex in
the presence of Ell3 (Supplementary Figure S4), we next
examined whether MDM2-induced p53 ubiquitination is
altered in Ell3-OE cells.
Phosphorylation of p53 at serine 15, which stabilizes
p53 by impairing its binding to MDM2, increased in
parallel with the increase in the total amount p53 in Ell3OE cells following CDDP treatment (Supplementary
Figure S5). p53 and MDM2 form an autoregulatory loop, in
which MDM2 degrades p53 through a ubiquitin-dependent
pathway and p53 functions as a transcriptional activator
of MDM2. Indeed, chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)
analysis showed that p53 bound to the promoter of MDM2
in the presence of CDDP in both Ell3-OE and control cells
(Figure 3B). Consistent with the results of ChIP analysis,
the level of MDM2 transcripts increased following CDDP
treatment in both Ell3-OE and control cells (Figure 3C).
Despite the activation of MDM2 transcription by CDDP,
MDM2 protein did not accumulate in Ell3-OE cells
(Figure  3D). Consistent with the deficiency of MDM2
protein, ubiquitination of p53 in Ell3-OE was weaker
than that in control cells, and MDM2 ubiquitination
of p53 did not increase after CDDP treatment in Ell3OE cells (Figure 3E). These results suggest that the
feedback pathway regulating p53 degradation might
be impaired in Ell3-OE regardless of the activation of
MDM2 transcription. Taken together, we conclude that an
impaired p53 ubiquitination system, in part, contributes
to p53 accumulation in Ell3-OE cells following CDDP
treatment.

Ell3 increases p53 protein stability
The total amount of p53 protein is strictly regulated
both at the transcriptional and post-translational levels.
To determine whether the accumulation of p53 in Ell3OE cells following CDDP treatment was induced by
transcriptional activation of TP53, we measured TP53
transcript levels. As shown in Figure 2A, TP53 transcript
levels in Ell3-OE cells were lower than those in control
cells and did not significantly change after CDDP
treatment. This result suggests that p53 accumulation was
caused by a change in protein turnover. Therefore, we
transiently overexpressed TP53 and analyzed its RNA and
protein levels in Ell3-OE and control cells. As expected,
p53 protein accumulated to a higher level in Ell3-OE cells
than in control cells, whereas TP53 transcript expression
was similar (Figure 2B). When p53 protein biosynthesis
from the TP53 expression plasmid was blocked with
cyclohexamide, the amount of p53 in Ell3-OE was stably
maintained for 24 h whereas the p53 level in control
cells gradually decreased (Figure 2C). Figure 2D shows
that a large amount of p53 translocated to the nucleus of
Ell3-OE cells following CDDP treatment, whereas, in
control cells, a comparable amount of p53 accumulated
in the nucleus only when MG132 was added to block the
proteosomal degradation pathway. These results confirm
that Ell3 enhanced the stability of p53 protein by blocking
proteosomal degradation. A GST pull-down assay showed
that p53 directly binds to Ell3, suggesting that the physical
binding of p53 to Ell3 might protect p53 from proteo­
somal degradation (Figure 2E). Co-immunoprecipitation
assays using extracts from deletion mutants of Ell3 and
p53 suggest that the whole domain of Ell3 binds to p53
(Supplementary Figure S4).

p53 is stabilized by its binding to NQO1 in
Ell3-OE cells
Figure 3C revealed that MDM2 mRNA levels
increased starting at 12 h after CDDP treatment in
control cells. By contrast, p53 in Ell3-OE began to
accumulate at 6 h after CDDP treatment, suggesting
that another pathway stabilizing p53, independent of
the ubiquitination pathway, operates in Ell3-OE cells.
Recently, p53 was shown to be stabilized by NQO1
under stress conditions. p53 binding to NQO1 allows
p53 to escape ubiquitin-independent 20S proteasomal
degradation by transferring p53 to the nucleus [21].
Figure 4A shows that NQO1 gradually translocated
to the nucleus after CDDP treatment and that higher
amounts of NQO1 accumulated in the nucleus of Ell3OE cells than in control cells. To confirm that NQO1
participates in the accumulation of p53, we examined the
nuclear colocalization of NQO1 and p53 by fluorescence
microscopy. As expected, a large proportion of Ell3-OE
cells showed colocalization of p53 and NQO1 in the
nucleus after CDDP treatment (Figure 4B).

Ubiquitin-dependent degradation of p53 is
suppressed in Ell3-OE cells
We next addressed whether p53 accumulation in
Ell3-OE cells was caused by rapid activation of the DNA
damage response pathway after CDDP treatment. CDDPmediated formation of mono-adducts and intra- and interstrand crosslinks in DNA inhibits DNA replication by
causing replication fork collapse [19]. Replication fork
collapse leads to single-stranded DNA breaks and activates
the DNA damage response, resulting in the activation
and accumulation of p53. Unexpectedly, p53 began to
accumulate at 6 h after CDDP treatment whereas γH2AX,

Curcumin is an inhibitor of NQO1 that competes
with NAD(P)H for binding to NQO1. It disrupts
NQO1-p53 binding and thus induces ubiquitinindependent proteasomal p53 degradation [5, 6, 21, 22].
When Ell3-OE were pretreated with curcumin, CDDPinduced p53 accumulation was abolished and the level
of p53 returned to basal levels (Figure 4C). Consistent
with the decrease in the p53 protein level, curcumin
pretreatment prevented CDDP-induced apoptotic
cell death in Ell3-OE cells, as shown by their nuclear
morphology, G0/G1 populations, and the results of the

MTT assay (Figure 4D, 4E, Supplementary Figure S6).
Inhibition of NQO1 expression in Ell3-OE cells after the
introduction of siNQO1 attenuated CDDP-induced p53
stabilization (Figure 4F). These results suggest that the
accumulation of p53 in Ell3-OE cells in response to CDDP
also depends on NQO1, which helps translocate p53 to
the nucleus where it is protected from 20S proteasome
degradation. Because NQO1 protects p53 by binding to
p53, we analyzed whether this binding was stronger in
Ell3-OE cells following CDDP treatment. As expected,
immunoprecipitation analysis showed that the amount of

protein accumulation and the phosphorylation of ERK1/2
following CDDP treatment (Figure 5D). Consistent with
the reduced p53 accumulation, suppression of IL20
expression by siRNA decreased apoptosis in Ell3-OE cells
with CDDP treatment (Figure 5E, Supplementary Figure
S7B). In addition, depletion of IL20 in the culture media
using an anti-IL20 monoclonal antibody substantially
decreased CDDP-induced accumulation of p53 and the
apoptosis of Ell3-OE cells (Figure 5F).
When Ell3 expression was suppressed by siEll3 in
Ell3-OE cells, IL20 expression was decreased (Figure
5G). Consistently, the amount of secreted IL20 was
also decreased by the suppression of Ell3 expression
(Figure 5H). These results suggest that IL20 expression
is dependent on the expression level of Ell3. To examine
whether Ell3 directly increased IL20 transcription, we
conducted ChIP analysis of the IL20 promoter using the
Ell3 antibody. The transcription initiation site of IL20 was
enriched by more than 2-fold in Ell3-OE cells compared
with control cells (Figure 5I). Taken together, these results
suggest that the chemosensitive response of Ell3-OE
cells is mainly due Ell3 functioning as a transcriptional
activator to increase the transcriptional efficiency of IL20,
resulting in higher Il20 levels and the activation of IL20induced ERK1/2 signaling.

Ell3 stabilizes p53 through IL20–ERK signaling
following CDDP treatment
Our results suggest that CDDP treatment of Ell3-OE
cells activates a mechanism that triggers the rapid binding
of NQO1 to p53. Previously, activation of ERK signaling
was shown to be associated with increased resistance to
5-fluorouracil in Ell3-OE cells [17]. We therefore asked
whether ERK signaling is also involved in the increased
sensitivity of Ell3-OE cells to CDDP. Figure 5A shows
that ERK signals in Ell3-OE cells were further activated
following CDDP treatment and, when ERK signaling was
chemically inhibited, CDDP-induced p53 accumulation
was dramatically reduced. Consistent with the decrease
in the p53 protein level, apoptotic cell death was also
blocked when CDDP treatment was done in the presence
of an ERK inhibitor (Figure 5B, Supplementary Figure
S7A). This result indicates that ERK signaling mediates
the stabilization of p53 in Ell3-OE cells after CDDP
treatment.
We next asked what causes the increase in ERK
signaling in Ell3-OE cells. To answer this question, we
compared the gene expression profiles of Ell3-OE and
control cells. Among the 143 genes whose expression
was activated by more than 2-fold in Ell3-OE cells, IL20
expression was the fifth highest (Figure 5C). Because
Ell3-OE cells show increased colony formation and cell
proliferation after ERK activation [17], we reasoned that
IL20 might be the cause of the higher ERK signaling
in Ell3-OE cells. To test this hypothesis, we suppressed
IL20 expression in Ell3-OE via siRNA and examined the
ERK signal activation after CDDP treatment. Notably,
introduction of siIL20 into Ell3-OE cells decreased p53

DISCUSSION
This study demonstrates that Ell3 induces a
chemosensitive response in breast cancer cell line MCF7,
by suppressing the MDM2-mediated pathway of p53
ubiquitination and increasing the binding of p53 to NQO1
after CDDP treatment (Figure 6).
In the xenograft mouse model, Ell3-OE cells
formed fewer tumors that were much smaller than the
tumors formed by control MCF7 cells (Supplementary

(Supplementary Figure S8, right) suggests that these cells
underwent apoptosis. Because IL20 is a proinflammatory
cytokine involved in various inflammatory diseases and
ischemic stroke [9, 13], it will be interesting to assess
whether Ell3-OE recruits immune cells that cause p53induced apoptosis.
Previous work [8, 23] and our own studies [17] reveal
that the ERK signaling pathway in Ell3-OE cells is the main
gateway for p53 stabilization following CDDP treatment.

Chemical inhibition of ERK signaling suppressed CDDPmediated apoptosis and p53 accumulation in Ell3-OE cells.
ERK signaling activated by the higher level of IL20 in
Ell3-OE cells was further stimulated by CDDP treatment.
Because increased ERK1/2 signaling in Ell3-OE cells did
not have any effect on p53 stabilization during normal
culture conditions, we speculate that the abnormally high
levels of ERK signaling in Ell3-OE cells preconditioned
them to rapidly respond to CDDP. However, we cannot

rule out the possibility that other factors, in addition
to ERK signaling, are synergistically involved in the
hypersensitive CDDP response of Ell3-OE cells. Catalase
and glutathione S-transferase, enzymes, which balance the
redox status of a cell, are transcriptionally suppressed in
Ell3-OE cells (data not shown). Another factor potentially
involved in the CDDP response could be reactive oxygen
species (ROS), which are present at high levels in Ell3OE cells (Supplementary Figure S9A). ROS stabilize p53

pyruvate decreased p53 accumulation in CDDP-treated
Ell3-OE cells (Supplementary Figure S9B). This result
indicates that the high level of ROS in Ell3-OE cells also
contributes to the hypersensitive response of Ell3-OE cells
to CDDP.
p53 protein stability is mainly controlled by
dynamic and reversible ubiquitination, which sensitizes
p53 protein to 26S proteosomal degradation. Our results
suggest that Ell3 stabilizes p53 via its effects on both
ubiquitin-dependent and -independent mechanisms.
The results in Figure 3 show that ubiquitin-dependent
degradation of p53 is impaired in Ell3-OE cells. This could
be explained by increased MDM2 protein degradation in
Ell3-OE cells. Indeed, p53 bound to the MDM2 promoter
and activated MDM2 transcription upon CDDP treatment;
however, MDM2 did not accumulate in Ell3-OE cells.
The simplest explanation for these contradictory results
is that proteosomal degradation of MDM2 is activated in
Ell3-OE cells, which would prevent the accumulation of
MDM2 despite that the increase in its transcription.
In addition to the ubiquitin-dependent degradation
pathway, p53 protein is also regulated by a constitutive
ubiquitin-independent mechanism of degradation by the
20S proteasome. We showed that the binding affinity
of p53 to NQO1 was enhanced by CDDP treatment of
Ell3-OE cells. In addition, treatment with curcumin,
which dissociates the NQO1–p53 complex, significantly
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

decreased p53 accumulation and the apoptotic cell
population in CDDP-treated Ell3-OE cells. These
results suggest that the high levels of p53 accumulation
following CDDP treatment in Ell3-OE cells are the result
of an additive effect or a synergism between a decrease
in ubiquitin-dependent degradation pathway activity and
an increase in NQO1-dependent protection of p53 against
degradation. Therefore, it is not surprising that the amount
of p53 accumulation in the nucleus of CDDP-treated Ell3OE was much higher than the amount of NQO1. NQO2
is also known to contribute to stabilization of p53 in
the nucleus. However, NQO2 did not translocate to the
nucleus in CDDP-treated Ell3-OE cells (data not shown),
suggesting that the activities of NQO1 and NQO2 in
stabilizing p53 are regulated by independent pathways.
Previously, we reported that ERK1/2 signaling in
Ell3-OE cells mediates 5-fluorouracil resistance [17].
This result is in contrast to the sensitive response of Ell3OE cells to CDDP, where ERK1/2 signaling promoted
p53 stability upon CDDP treatment. The reasons for this
discrepancy are unknown, but may be due to the opposite
patterns of MDM2 accumulation and phospho-p53 (S15)
accumulation in 5-fluorouracil- and CDDP-treated cells
(Supplementary Figure S10). Elucidating how Ell3
induces contradicting responses in cancer cells to different
drugs will extend our understanding of the regulatory
mechanism of p53 stability.
In conclusion, we have demonstrated that the
transcription elongation factor Ell3 induces chemosen­
sitization of MCF7 cells to the chemotherapeutic agent
CDDP by stabilizing p53. Our data suggest that p53
stabilization following treatment with an antitumor
drug is a highly regulated process. The balance between
degradation and stabilization is not simply determined
by the ubiquitination status of p53, but rather is regulated
by cytokine expression and signaling pathways that man­
age the ubiquitin-dependent and ubiquitin-independent
degradation of p53. This knowledge will provide a basis for

Figure 6: Model for Ell3 activity stabilizing p53 protein following CDDP treatment in breast cancer cells. Ell3 expression

leads to the suppression of MDM2 expression and activation of the IL20 mediated ERK1/2 signaling pathway. Due to the low level of
MDM2, p53 is not ubiquitinated following CDDP treatment. Additional ERK1/2 is phosphorylated following CDDP treatment, resulting
in increased binding affinity of NQO1 to p53. The synergistic effect of suppressing the MDM2 pathway and enhancing the IL20 pathway
causes rapid stabilization of p53 in Ell3-overexpressing breast cancer cells following CDDP treatment.

by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL; Bio-Rad, CA, USA).

Cells were prepared as a single-cell suspension of
1 × 106 cells/ml in PBS. After fixing with cold 70% ethanol
for 2 h, cells were washed with cold PBS and then stained
with propidium iodide at a final concentration of 50 μg/ml
in the presence of 20 μg/ml RNase and 10% Triton X-100
in PBS for 1 h at 37°C. Treated cells were washed with
PBS and then evaluated by flow cytometry.

Immunoprecipitation
Cells were washed with PBS and harvested in lysis
buffer. Cell lysates were cleared by centrifugation at
12,000 rpm for 15 min at 4°C. For immunoprecipitations,
cell lysates were incubated with 4 μg of antibody for
16 h at 4°C followed by incubation with 30 μl of protein
G beads for 1 h at 4°C. Beads were washed once in lysis
buffer. Samples were boiled in SDS–PAGE sample buffer
and analyzed by western blotting.

Cells were cultured on cover slips, washed twice
with PBS, and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 15
min. The cover slips were washed three times with PBS
and permeabilized with 0.1% Tween-20 in PBS for 20 min
followed by blocking for 30 min using blocking buffer
(5% bovine serum albumin in PBS). After an overnight
incubation with the primary antibodies at 4°C, the cover
slips were washed three times with PBS and incubated
with fluorescent secondary antibodies for 1 h in the dark at
room temperature. The cover slips were then washed three
times in PBS and mounted with Vectashield Mounting
